R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Yeah, hi.  This is Karen in North Carolina.
L:  Hi, Karen.  My name is Ross and I'm in New York.
R:  Ross?
L:  Yep.
R:  Oh, okay.  Hello.  How are ya?
L:  [LIPSMACK] I'm fine.
R:  They got a Yankee and a southerner.
L:  That's right.
R:  Right.  So, [NOISE] as they say, the topic for today is exercise.
L:  Okay.
R:  Well, no, I don't exercise regularly and yes --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I probably should and would like to. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay [LAUGH], um, I actually probably exercise enough for both of us. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, goodness. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I exercise four days a week.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I swim.
R:  Good gracious.
L:  Um, sorry?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I didn't hear what you had said.
R:  I'm sorry, I said, "Good gracious".
L:  Oh, good gracious --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- yes.  So, um, well, I had lost, uh, a great deal of weight --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- uh, years back and so, I've -- I never to gain it back [LAUGH] again.  So, um, it -- I -- it keeps it off.
R:  It -- so -- it -- you stuck with it, huh?
L:  Yah.  I had [NOISE] lost, um -- well, how much is it?  I lost a hundred and forty pounds.
R:  Wow.  How did you do that?
L:  Well, the joke goes -- I -- it was, I moved out of New Jersey. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] We make a lot of jokes about New [LAUGH] Jersey [LAUGH] --
R:  About [LAUGH] New --
L:  -- around.
R:  -- Jersey, of course.
L:  [several inaudible words], um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so, I guess -- I guess, the whole country makes jokes about New Jersey, right?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So, it's, er, comfortable.  Um, and, oh, you know, not to sound like Shirley McLean but I started feeling better about myself on the inside --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so, then I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- was able to do something about the [LAUGH] outside --
R:  Outside. [NOISE]
L:  -- and so, uh --
R:  It was -- was exercise a -- a big part of that?
L:  Well, it's a big part of it because I really never used to do it before --
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  -- but in addition, um, I changed the types of foods that I was eating --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and how I would prepare them and the portions, the sizes and you know, I don't eat any, um -- [LIPSMACK] I don't eat any fried foods any more.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  I haven't for years.  Um, and I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- pay close attention to the fat content in things --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, uh -- and -- and of sugar and things.  Um, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know and also my grandmother, uh, she had passed away from complications of diabetes, so, you know --
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  -- not -- not to eat too much sugar and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- uh -- and also to exercise, so, you know, that's another concern.  But, um, the two --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- combined, you know, it keeps it off.  So, uh -- and I -- and I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- have a tremendous amount of energy now.
R:  [NOISE] Well, the -- hey -- yeah, and that's what everybody says, you know, you lose a -- yes, mm, you start with just a few pounds and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- your energy level [NOISE] goes way up.
L:  Mhm.  What you --
R:  So ...
L:  -- making for dinner --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- there?
R:  [LIPSMACK] I'm having fresh corn out of my garden.  I'm having --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- fresh field peas and fresh potatoes out of my garden.
L:  My goodness.
R:  So, we're having a vegetable supper tonight.
L:  I was gonna ask, are you a vegetarian? [LAUGH]
R:  Well, we're not vegetarians [LAUGH] but when fresh vegetables are coming off the -- out of the garden --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- we usually don't eat any meat 'cause the vegetables are so good.
L:  Oh, sure, sure --
R:  So --
L:  -- sure.  Oh, that's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- good.
R:  So, it's always limited.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But no, I -- a matter of fact, I just bought a, um [LIPSMACK], pilate tape, uh, one day last week and I just haven't put it in yet to try it.  A friend of mine does pilates and says it's just really great.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I thought, "Well, I'll try that and see how that is, see if I can, you know ..."  It's three ten minute intervals.  And I thought, "Well, if I can start with ten minutes here and ten minutes there, I think I can work that in between work and two children" --
L:  Well --
R:  -- and maybe I can -- if I get into that and like it then hopefully I can stick with it.
L:  If -- you know, anything that, uh -- a- any exercise is better than no exercise.
R:  Do what?
L:  Uh, any exercise --
R:  Is better than --
L:  -- is better than no exercise at all.
R:  This is true.
L:  So -- and you know something?  I live in New York City in Manhattan --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and we walk a lot.
R:  Right.
L:  And you would be surprised at the nu- -- have you been to New York?
R:  Yes, went two years ago, for the first --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- time, matter of fact.
L:  Okay.  How'd you like it?
R:  Oh, I loved it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I absolutely loved it.
L:  Well, you know something?  You'd be surp- -- I was gonna say, you'd be surprised at the number of people that -- that are truly overweight here and -- and --
R:  When you walk --
L:  -- we walk --
R:  -- a lot.
L:  -- a lot.
R:  You're right.
L:  You know.
R:  Uh, because -- my -- I mean, I was tired from walking --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, so much.  You know, we -- w- I live in the country, so I have to drive everywhere I go --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and being in New York and you know, we walked everywhere we went. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I thought, "I wonder how many miles I have walked in this week?"  You know, I wish I could have had a counter to actually keep up with how much I walked 'cause I --
L:  You know something?
R:  -- prob- -- I would've surprised myself, I imagine.
L:  We -- we don't even think about it.  We just do it.
R:  It's just a -- a way of life.
L:  Yeah, but the -- the interesting --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- thing --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is, either you have very fit people --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- here, or very overweight people here --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and you wouldn't think that would be the case in a city where people walk so much.
R:  Right.
L:  Um --
R:  But I found that most people don't really prepare their food.  They usually stop and pick up something on the way.
L:  Well, that is a problem, so --
R:  And you know, prepared food is usually always much less healthier than food that you can, you know, fix yourself.
L:  Well, it tends to be the way but it doesn't have to --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to be.  I mean, it's just choices that you make --
R:  Right.
L:  -- along the way.
R:  I guess, it's just that convenience of picking up something that's not --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- healthy.  It's just a little bit more convenient sometimes.
L:  Well, people like the taste of [LAUGH] those things --
R:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- but [LAUGH] --
R:  That fat always tastes really good. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  So, um -- so, anyway, so that's, uh -- that's what I do --
R:  Right.
L:  -- for exercise and, uh, I used to jog.  I used --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- to run.  But, um, it's too strenuous.  Uh, you know, even if you're in shape, it puts a lot of stress on your -- on your bones, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and whatnot, so, uh --
R:  And your knees tend to --
L:  And your knees and every- --
R:  Takes a --
L:  -- -thing and your hips and just the whole -- the whole body.  So, swimming --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- alleviates all of that.
R:  So, you swim and what else do you do? [NOISE]
L:  Well, I think that's enough. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean --
R:  So, you swim --
L:  -- I sw- --
R:  -- at least four days a week?
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  You swim at least four days a week?
L:  Well, that's a -- I mean, that's enough.  I -- I --
R:  That's --
L:  -- swim four --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- days a week for about forty minutes --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- at a time and I -- I do eighty laps each --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- time.  So, uh -- so, with that, you know, I -- I -- I -- I stay very fit and I mean, I am thin now, so, uh --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, that's -- that -- then I mean, I also, uh -- I mean, I walk here --
R:  Right.
L:  -- uh, a great -- I mean, I do take the bus and the subway, the train --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but, uh, you know, I think that people in the city do walk -- walk a lot --
R:  Right.
L:  -- more so, than people out in the suburbs --
R:  Do --
L:  -- especially.
R:  -- do you try to your -- like your -- er, your everyday walking that you have to do, do you try to pick up the pace with that and make it a brisk walk, rather than just a casual walk?
L:  No, because in New York --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- when we walk, it's a New York walk.
R:  It's a brisk walk anyway, huh?
L:  It's a brisk walk [LAUGH] anyway [LAUGH], so we're --
R:  Unless you're a tourist and you're just kind of walking around looking.
L:  No, it's, uh -- New Yorkers are actually -- it's close to walking.  It's -- it's like just before what it would become considered a -- a -- you know, running. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's how we walk, or jogging --
R:  Well, I can relate to --
L:  -- you know --
R:  -- that, considering the -- the people that I ran into, or they ran into me, I guess I should say --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when I was in New York.  It -- it -- yeah, it is a fast walk.
L:  Yeah, so -- so, that's what, uh -- that's what I do.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, once in a while I do go running.  In fact, last week I had -- I had gone running, uh, around the park, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it -- because of like the weather --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- you know, when it's very, very hot and humid, it's not nice to be out like that.  When it's very, very cold and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- snowing --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, er, raining and hailing, it's not nice to do that, so --
R:  So, we have an --
L:  -- years ago --
R:  -- indoor pool [NOISE] that makes it more convenient --
L:  Yeah, sure and --
R:  -- to stick with it.
L:  -- so, you can just go, you know, whatever the weather is and -- and doing so, there's no excuse not to exercise.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  So, I went yesterday, I'll go tomorrow.
R:  That's right --
L:  So ...
R:  -- well, hey, that -- that works. [NOISE]
L:  So --
R:  And do you have like, uh -- is there like a -- a -- a c- -- a swim club?  Do you have -- 'cause I imagine po- -- indoor pools other than in motels are hard to find in New York?
L:  Uh, yeah, well, I -- I belong to a gym.  It's, uh --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- YMCA.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And so, there's a large pool there and so, that's where I go.  Most of the pools around the gyms in New York --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- aren't all that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- big.
R:  Right.
L:  And so --
R:  Yes, anyway, New York's hard to put anything big. [NOISE]
L:  Well, there are lots --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of big things here but --
R:  I mean, there's lots of big things but there's no space for putting like big pools.  You know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- everything is so on top of each other. [NOISE]
L:  Right --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so, 'cause the property value is -- they're not -- they --
R:  Right.
L:  -- don't want to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- spend it building a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- pool.  They --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- they want to put up a -- a high rise --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- building, you know.
R:  Right, where they can make more money off of it.
L:  Offices, or -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- apartments, so, yeah, making more money --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- off it.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, anyway -- so, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so, that's that.  Yeah, I never, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I never really like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, working --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, on weights and stuff like that.  Uh --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the aerobics is, uh, more along the lines of what I've always enjoyed doing --
R:  [NOISE] Well, I think --
L:  -- so ...
R:  -- you know [NOISE], if you -- er, with everybody [NOISE], if you got to find that one thing that you like, or you're not gonna [NOISE] stick with it.
L:  That's true.
R:  You know, if you --
L:  And you know one thing about swimming -- yeah, Karen is your first name?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  One thing about swimming Karen, is that I can start when I want, I can finish when I want, I do it alone, it's a -- you know, it's a solo sport --
R:  Right.
L:  -- if you're not on a team --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or whatnot and so, I found that in doing so, I always do the same amount of time each week a number --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- of times.  Because if I had have belonged to a team --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to do something, or a group, or a class --
R:  Right.
L:  -- if you can't make it at --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a certain time, oh, well, well, there goes one day out of the week where --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you're not gonna go and you know and it can just, uh, get worse and worse that way, so -- I mean, I am a social --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, a -- a social pers- -- a sociable person, uh, I just -- I find that for athletics, it's -- er, I -- I -- I -- I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- enjoy it more, I prefer to, you know, do those things alone.
R:  Right.  I'm on the phone sweetie [NOISE].  I see it.  
L:  [MN]
R:  That's my -- [NOISE] my children were outside in the swimming pool actually swimming.  We have just a little small, like three foot by twelve foot pool --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and they were outside swimming and I noticed the wind was blowing and they just came in and one of them said, "Look outside" and I -- I just heard thunder.  So, I'm glad they were smart enough to come back inside. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, we, yeah.  Well, we had a -- we had a storm here today --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and this morning was very, very hot and very, very humid --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and there's a -- er, excuse me, this afternoon it went down like thirteen, fourteen, fifteen degrees and now it's cool.
R:  And now -- 'cause I -- I'm out my front while I'm talking, I'm gonna step outside 'cause we've had like ninety eight degrees today [NOISE] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- very hot, very humid and of course, every --
