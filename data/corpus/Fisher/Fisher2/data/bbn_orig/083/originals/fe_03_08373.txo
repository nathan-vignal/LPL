R:  Hi, I'm Vicky.
L:  Uh, James. [NOISE]
R:  So, good to talk to you.
L:  Yeah, you said your name was Vicky?
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay, so we're supposed to talk -- supposed to talk about the topic?
R:  Yeah.  I actually do exercise, which still surprises me 'cause I was always one of those kids who hated gym.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  How about you?
L:  I do.
R:  What do you do?
L:  I play rugby, um, I go to the gym regularly and I also do yoga, which I'm actually -- just got back from about an hour ago. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I -- I was going to go to yoga today and just felt -- just -- I just didn't get around to it.  I-- I went to the gym yesterday, I -- mostly what I do actually, is lift weights.
L:  Yeah, yeah, I lift too as well.  'Cause I generally do something athletic at least once a day.
R:  Yeah, I'm not into any of the competitive stuff because it -- that one is just too easy to start saying, "Oh, I'm not goo- -- you know, he's better than I am, that's no good".  With the weights it's, "Okay, can I add --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- five pounds to this?"  So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's a lot easier to say, "Yes, I'm doing the right thing here".
L:  Yeah.  I also swim, I teach swim lessons, so ...
R:  I keep thinking I really want to learn to swim properly.  I mean, you know, I can swi- -- I can do a dog paddle and that sort of thing but ...
L:  Well, where are you located?
R:  New York City.
L:  So, am I, I'll teach you. [LAUGH]
R:  Really. [LAUGH] Where in New -- [NOISE] they actually have a gym at the pool at my gym and everything.
L:  Well, really, that's funny.  I actually teach, um, to inner city kids, um, like Lowington[?]-- it's the Lowington program government sponsored and I teach sixth graders.
R:  Yeah, well at the moment I'm kind of low income being unemployed, but I think they probably don't want grown ups through that.  I don't think I could pass myself off as a sixth grader any more.
L:  Mm, no, I don't think so. [LAUGH]
R:  No, [NOISE] which is just --
L:  So --
R:  -- as well.
L:  Um, it's -- it's good though.  So, exercise? [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  I'm -- it's funny, I -- I could spend two hours a day exercising sometimes but it's -- it's not really something to talk about, it's just, you know, go in there and do it and [NOISE] get on with --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the next thing.
L:  Yeah.  Um, I guess why --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- do you exercise?
R:  Why?  It's because I m- -- well actually I -- I tried it kind of in an odd way, my husband had back problems and they told him, "You are going to go back to the gym or you will need surgery again".
L:  Okay.
R:  And he seemed to be enjoying it so I said, "What the hell" and gave it a try and I started to feel better.
L:  Yeah.  I always notice that, um, when I don't exercise I sort of feel depressed.  It's, like -- it really makes you happier, in my opinion.
R:  Yeah.  I'm not sure it makes me happier but it does make you more energetic which is, I guess, another part of depression, if you see what I mean?
L:  Yeah.  Well, I really feel physically depressed, I mean, emotionally depressed, uh, rather, when I don't work out, and it's really weird and I go through periods, you know, of a few weeks or whatever and I'll start feeling really down and then I start working out again and I feel great again.
R:  Yeah, one thing I de- decided a few -- a while back, is I realized -- you don't have to want to go to the gym, you just have to get there, you know.
L:  Yes.
R:  -- I could be bitching and moaning and just like, "No I don't want to do this, I don't want to do this" I just have to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- go in -- walk in anyway be- -- if I get there and start doing it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I -- I wind up --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- liking doing it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, it's, like, the initial --
L:  But I've, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'm a college student so I usually don't have a problem finding time to work out.  But, in the summer when I work full time and it's always, like, I was, you know -- I bitch about it to my friends, I'm like, "How do -- how do working people -- every day people go to the gym?"  It's so hard 'cause I get done at work at six and the gym is crowded and --
R:  [SIGH] Well --
L:  -- well, like, I can -- like you just have to go -- just go.
R:  Yeah, one thing I was doing for a while, was going on my lunch hour.  Fortunately, the place I was working, I didn't have to punch a clock so, you know, if I took an hour and fi- -- a little -- an extra few minutes at lunch I could just stay a few minutes late at the end of the day and it balanced.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're just pushing now, at my gym -- they've got some kind of brand name for it, it's basically, they claim it's a complete -- like a complete weight work out in twenty two minutes or less, which I don't believe --
L:  Yeah, I don't know.
R:  I'm not, you know -- one set of twelve rests instead of three of ten to fifteen is not the -- it -- it's not the same.  But, I think it is aimed at the, "I'm in a hurry" kind of thing, 'cause, you know, if you do some kind of a weight work out in your lunch hour --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and --
L:  Well, that's pretty good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I wish I had time in my lunch hour to do that. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't really get a lunch hour. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well they offered before and after work hours as well --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so, you know, people could -- you -- you -- somebody could -- you can show up at -- at five thirty, change and be done at a quarter after six.
L:  What gym do you use?
R:  New York Sports Club.
L:  New York -- uh, so do I.
R:  Yeah, I saw --
L:  Uh, they're pretty much everywhere I guess, huh?
R:  Yeah, I started using it 'cause it was near by where I was working then --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I just got in the habit and, like I said, I have nev- -- I hadn't been a person who exercised so I liked the fact that I could buy a one month at a time membership and not commit myself to a year.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that was three years ago.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But, you know, if I had to put down the money for two years up front, I probably wouldn't have done it.  So, I guess they know what --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they're doing.
L:  Yeah, no, I mean -- I -- I -- I got a year up front, I usually get a year up front 'cause it's so much cheaper.
R:  Yeah, the deal, uh --
L:  -- you know.
R:  -- I should ask them if they'll -- if they'll -- I'll get a better rate now if I go by the year, 'cause I've been doing it by the month long enough without really checking for other options.
L:  Yeah, no, it's -- it's usually a lot cheaper if -- if you could go by the year.  You know, I mean, it's -- it's -- it's, like, you know, eight hundred bucks up front or whatever, seven hundred, so it's worth --
R:  Which basically means I'd be getting two months free.
L:  Sometimes it's hard to come by but --
R:  Yeah, right now I wouldn't be able to come by it, but when I've got the money again ...
L:  So, you're -- you're unemployed you said?
R:  Yeah.
L:  What is it that you do?
R:  What -- m -- m -- m -- well I -- I do editing and proof reading or basically a bit of whatever -- I've done some computer systems administration, [NOISE] I've done a little bit of research --
L:  Hm, interesting.
R:  -- but most -- m- mostly editorial work.
L:  Uh, well --
R:  You know, I'm -- I'm the person who worries about where the commas go so some -- a lot of people don't have to.
L:  Yeah, well, I'll send you my school papers.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, but --
L:  You could do a little --
R:  -- I'm not writing them for you. [LAUGH]
L:  You could do a little freelance editing.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I've been just seeing too many people out there whose idea is -- is, "Oh, you write the paper for me". [SIGH]
L:  Well, no.
R:  No. [SIGH]
L:  No, that's -- I'm not --
R:  It's like it's, no, I -- that's not good, it's just like you can't go to the gym for me. [SIGH]
L:  So, you think we're really going to get paid for this thing? [LAUGH]
R:  I damn well hope so. [LAUGH]  Actually I know somebody who says they've gotten their first check for it.
L:  All right, well, sweet, I guess, maybe, we should talk about exercises still then.
R:  [LAUGH] Yes, or at least how we're going to pay for the gym memberships now that we're getting paid for this. [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, um what else about exercise, um ...?
R:  Yeah, I mean, like all --
L:  I don't --
R:  -- uh -- uh -- uh -- like okay, I take vitamins once a day, which is [LAUGH] a big deal, you know, it -- it-- it -- it's so much a routine. [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, you take vit- -- yeah, you take vitamins once a day?
R:  Yeah, you know, just the multi vitamin, you know, you get ou- -- uh -- uh -- get out of shower, take the vitamins you have -- you know, 'cause it -- it -- 'cause they're right by the sink.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Same trick.  It's the -- it's the same trick as the exercise.  Well, once I have to think about it the more likely it is to get done.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, if I could just figure, "Okay, it's Thursday, I will get up and go to the gym", that's easier than deciding, "Oh, I'm really in a mood to lift weights now".
L:  Yeah, are you a coffee drinker?
R:  'Cause it has to have been a really bad day at work before I'm really in a mood to lift weights before I get there.
L:  Yeah.  Are you a coffee drinker?
R:  No, I'm a tea drinker, which is --
L:  Do you --
R:  -- basically -- it comes to about the some thing as far as, you know, caffeine and so on, I just never liked --
L:  Do --
R:  -- coffee.
L:  Do you drink it every day?
R:  Yeah, probably more of it --
L:  In the morning?
R:  -- than I ought to, in fact I've got a cup right next to me now.  Yes, that's how -- yes, this is -- probably usually -- these days it's first thing before I even get in the shower, the first cup of tea.
L:  Okay, yeah, I'm -- no, me too.  I mean, I wake up -- for coffee -- I wake up and drink coffee and a lot of guys tell me that they have -- they've success with their workouts when they, like, cut back or quit the caffeine but, like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I mean, I've had it since I was in high school, like, I used to put coffee in protein shakes before I went to high school when I wrestled and, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, I -- I feel like I just need it, so ...
R:  Yeah, I've try -- I've tried once or twice doing without it and it's, like, I -- you can get off it but it -- you know, it's headaches and so on and it's just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it -- it's an automatic enough part of what I do and my doctor thinks it's okay.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I mean, to be honest, I like it.  I like the little ritual, you know, it's not just the way it makes me feel, it's like the -- the buying the coffee, grinding it, I -- I just like the little ritual of it.
R:  Yeah, the ritual, you -- uh -- uh -- it -- including the kettle whistles and [inaudible] uh, stir it in -- I like the way tea tastes for that matter.
L:  Yeah, no, I mean, I love coffee. [LAUGH]
R:  And the other thing is, I'm not looking to bulk up, I mean --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I want the muscle, I want the strength but it's not going to show on the outside anyway.
L:  Do you think you're in really good shape for, um --
R:  No, I think I'm in o- I think I'm in okay shape but not bad for thirty nine and creaky, 'cause the problem --
L:  Oh, thirty nine?
R:  -- yeah -- the problem is you get all these stupid cumulative things, like I banged my wrists in college once --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I chipped the bone and it more --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- or less healed but that kind of thing never entirely heals.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, once in a while it hurts again and, you know, so I can go and I can lift weights and I can get stronger but it's not going to do anything for the bones.
L:  Yeah, no.
R:  Oh well, actually they've got these signs at the gym insisting that -- that weight training does help you ke- ke- keep your bones strong.  But, it's not going to heal this.
L:  Yeah.  I actually just jammed my thumb last night.  It's, like, black and blue on both joints right now.
R:  Ouch.
L:  Yeah, it's sucks, I jam- jammed in rugby practice --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I -- I was, like, having trouble writing and typing today, it was awful.
R:  Yeah, I banged it in -- in -- uh -- I'm not even sure how I did it but I got this nasty bruise on my shin yes- -- shin when the trainer was working me through this silly express line thingummy yesterday, I said, "Look what --"
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you know, I said, "Okay, let's not put them in -- put the pad for the machine just there because it'll press on the bruise".
L:  Yeah, huh.
R:  And, you know --
L:  So, yeah --
R:  -- mostly I can work around it.
L:  Yeah, well that's good.  I n- -- I've never really hurt anything that has any sort of la- --
