R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, I'm Fernando. [NOISE]
L:  Fernando, I'm Trish.
R:  Hi, Trish?
L:  How are you?
R:  Fine, how are you doing?
L:  I'm good.
R:  So, the subject is working out, right?
L:  Yep.
R:  Health and fitness? [NOISE]
L:  Health and fitness, whether or not you do anything to keep your body in shape.
R:  Yeah.  Do -- do you d- -- work out?
L:  Yes, as a matter of fact I do.
R:  Oh good, what do you do? [NOISE]
L:  We go to the gym, my husband and I.
R:  Okay.
L:  We have a gym mem- membership and, uh, I worked out with a trainer for about four months, a personal trainer --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so I have a pretty -- you know, I have a pretty decent regimen of what I'm supposed to be doing.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, I go in and do cardio for about twenty or twenty five minutes and then --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- I go down to the weight room.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- yeah, I heard that you're supposed to do resistance training first before you do cardio?
L:  Really?
R:  Simply because, uh, when you do cardio you get too tired and it takes muscle coordination to find -- like, muscle skills --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to get the right -- proper form, [NOISE] you know, of a -- and what happens is -- is your form suffers and that can lead to injuries and improper, um, work outs.
L:  I wonder if that has something to do with how long you do it 'cause, like, on the days I don't do resistance training --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I do more cardio.
R:  Really.
L:  And if I'm doing my weight training I only do maybe twenty, twenty five minutes of cardio.
R:  Oh, really.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But I can see it either way 'cause after you do resistance training, you know, it'd be hard to get a half an hour on some of the -- the, uh, cardio stuff too.
R:  Yeah, how -- how -- how can you, um -- how -- how much do [NOISE] you work out per d- per day?
L:  Per day, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if I'm going to do the full training, I mean, it's just about an hour.
R:  An hour?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  See I like to do -- I used to work a- at a gym.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I had a friend that was a body builder.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  He was an amateur, he never competed but he got pretty big.  So, we used to do heavy weights, you know, how much you could bench pre- -- I did the f- -- I maxed down that flying machine as much as I can and before I start everything.  I did -- I found it benefits in my strength increasing, the problem was though, um -- my stamina wasn't there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I would ha- -- I -- I would do cardio work out, like, Stairmasters and, uh, treadmill --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, I couldn't keep my strength up for long, I would tire quickly.
L:  Mhm.
R:  My strength would be lost, like carrying something heavy, so what, um [NOISE] -- what I decided to do was start doing more reps.  Now, I keep my stamina -- I can keep my strength up longer and I found that if I do s- such things as, uh, high reps, I actually burn more calories per work out and I keep in better, uh, shape.
L:  How often do you work out?
R:  Uh, I try to do at least three times a week.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I got over a bug, [NOISE] so I'm only working out three times this week.  I'm going to try to increase to maybe four or five.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, basically, what I do is, I bought a -- a tower, it's called the j- -- The Body by Jake Tower --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and it's made by Body by Ja- Jake company and it -- basically what it is that you do pull ups, a certain type of  pull ups, close up my grip, had a -- a part where you can -- has handles that come down -- like, you can do dips, they come up and you can do leg lifts.  You have also a -- a thing where you can do extended push ups --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and you can do stom- stomach crunches.
L:  Oh okay.
R:  I found that -- that if I do a lot of those, I mean, high rep, I -- I can get in shape a lot better.  My stamina, my endurance and my strength is up.  I can burn calories, um -- mm, a lot of calories.  I mean, much more than if I were on, like, the bench press.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I found a lot of push ups is better than bench pressing a lot of weight.  I found, you know, pull ups, my own body weight's better than pulling more than my weight, 'cause I can only do so much.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I mean, I was always sore, I was always hungry and, um, I got really slow, you know, and, uh, so I found out -- and kind of clumsy.  So, I prefer high rep weights now.
L:  What was, um -- what was your initial motivation to start working out?
R:  Uh, at that time?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, my friends were pla- -- working out and I'd been working out since -- actually when I was a child I was overweight --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so around --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- fifteen I started exercising and at fifteen years old, I -- I -- I lost more weight, my confidence  --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- increased, you know.  And being in high school, you know, my mind's on girls, so -- [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know --
L:  You're in high school now?
R:  Uh, no, not any more, at that --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- time I was.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  Um, when I was fifteen, you know -- you know, there's all the --
L:  So, it's kind of vanity at that point?
R:  Sorry?
L:  So, it's kind of for vanity purposes at that point?
R:  Yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- vanity and little of ego --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- well not -- yeah, kind of.  You know, 'cause when I was in, um -- I was a freshman, I was a chil- -- I was an overweight child -- uh, child, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there were some girls I liked who didn't know I was there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And as -- and as I gai- -- I lost some weight and kind of cleaned up I thought -- now seeing that they -- they'd come around more, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, uh, that really gave me -- now it just makes me feel good.
L:  Yeah, I think that's initially why a lot of us work out for vanity.  I was, uh, one of those that was in the gym five and six days a week.
R:  Oh, really.
L:  Every morning at -- you know, five and six o'clock in the morning.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, after we had our first child I kind of went downhill --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I gained weight and I decided that I needed to get it off because I could look like I used to look again, which I do now --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and so it was that plus the fact that, um, my mother passed away of a heart attack --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- a massive heart attack about five years ago and I just, um, thought, you know, I need to keep myself in shape 'cause I don't want to put myself at -- you know, in -- in danger of having the same thing happen to me.
R:  Mm.  Yeah.  I, um -- I have insomnia and I found that exercising helps my insomnia, you know.  If I don't exercise I have a hard time sleeping --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  It wears you out just enough --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to make you want to sleep.  Do you exercise --
R:  Ye- --
L:  -- in the morning or the evening?
R:  Afternoon, I try to start around two o'clock 'cause I --
L:  Uh, see, I can't do that, I have to do it in the morning.
R:  Really.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Helps you wake up, huh?
L:  We- -- not only that, it's, um, at five in the morning is the only time of day that it just won't interfere with anything else.
R:  I see.
L:  You know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because any other time during the day I can, um -- I can plan to exercise, but there are too many other things going on --
R:  Yeah -- see --
L:  -- with my family and, uh, my work, you know, work on my husband's schedule and stuff, I just, you know -- there's too much going on.
R:  So --
L:  But, if I get up at f- -- you know, go to the gym at five, it's, you know -- there's nothing else going on, like, other than sleep, so ...
R:  Yeah, see, I -- I do that too.  See, I work -- I work in my own backyard, I don't do the gym no more.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I run a business --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I teach guitar in the evenings --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- actually I'm here in my studio right now.  I- in the mornings -- well I'm -- I have summer off, I -- they -- they didn't give me a summer school job, I work for a school district at a high school --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so after work --
L:  And you're a teacher?
R:  -- around --
L:  Are you a music teacher?
R:  Yeah, well I, uh -- I teach music at my own business.
L:  Okay.
R:  At the high school I work for special education.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  There I don't teach music, so -- but, um, basically, um, I find the best time for me is around two o'clock.
L:  Okay.
R:  I go bike riding a lot, I have punching bags, you know.  I even skip rope and I found out if I get a little bit of caffeine right before I skip rope, [LAUGH] I do a lot better.
L:  Does it kind of wake --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you up again, give you a second wind for the afternoon?
R:  No, it actually it -- I do s- -- if I do enough of it, it actually mellows me out.
L:  Okay.
R:  I burn all my calories and any stress is gone.  So, uh, when I teach I'm more -- I'm more -- I -- I actually get a kind -- I did a lot of it too for that -- runner's high thing --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- become a natural high, you know, feels good, you know.  When I skip rope a lot it's -- it's harder than to Stairmaster.  I mean, you get really into it and it's really hard, more, uh --
L:  Now, I really would like to start diversifying my work out.  I would love to do something like just riding my bike, you know, and I think I've convinced myself that my time is just such that I have to do a certain strict regimen, you know.
R:  Yeah.  You want to have, uh, a variety on your work out --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because if you don't you get bored.
L:  Yeah, right now, I mean, there are times I get bored it's -- I just go in there and say. "Okay, you know, it's either this or you go back to gaining the twenty five pounds again --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- from the kids, you know", so [SIGH] that's my motivation to keep going but it's not always exciting, I just keep my headset on --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, um, I have to listen to fast paced music.
R:  Yeah, rock -- I listen to rock and roll --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's my thing, I'm a rocker.  There's another thing too, um -- another motivation 'cause I'm starting a band, you know, and I -- I'm a guitarist so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, you kind of -- kind of have to kind of have your looks in the rock band --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a- any band.  I mean --
L:  Any band.
R:  -- even if people say this and this and all the big arguments the fact is fact, you know, um, peo- people, uh, do have a superficial eye.
L:  Yeah.
R:  People do judge, you know, what they see --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- and if you're in a band playing, you know, you -- you know, you -- it's just yo- you got -- is how -- y- you have to have the showmanship --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and people want to see -- rather see somebody that's slim -- slimmer in shape than rather than heavy, you know.
L:  You know, that's interesting, my husband is out playing a gig tonight.
R:  Oh, he's in a mus- he's a musician too?
L:  Yep, he's the keyboard player --
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  -- he also works for the -- with the high school system, he works with the -- the, um, choirs --
R:  Oh, really.
L:  -- at the high school --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, uh, right now --
