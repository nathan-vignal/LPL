L:  Hi, my name is Amanda.
R:  Hi, I'm Gretel here.
L:  Hi.  Well, do you exercise regular?
R:  Yeah, I try and exer- uh, exercise quite regularly but like the most that I can do is do a lot of walking maybe around one and half to two mile everyday.
L:  Wow.
R:  What -- what about you?
L:  Oh, I'm really terrible right now, the most that I'm doing is swimming a bit every other day.  I've really gotten out of practice since I finished college.
R:  Uh-huh.  I --
L:  And then I just walk everywhere [LAUGH] constantly.
R:  [LAUGH] Because walking is the easiest that I can really do [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with my son around.  Like if he's -- when he's biking I can at least do a fast walk behind him.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, that way I try and exercise otherwise my house would keep me so busy. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And that's one --
L:  And that's definitely exercise.
R:  My husband complains about it all the time.  He said, like, you don't exercise, it's only the top part of your body, you need to more, like, you know, working out that is more of exercising rather than sitting at home and saying housework is an exercise. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  But, yeah, you're moving around, you get your heart rate up, uh, maybe your house is cleaner than mine but I know that cleaning my house [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- is always [LAUGH] severe exercise.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  I tried going to the gym, but then it somehow doesn't work out for me.  I get, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a fixed routine.
L:  Yeah.  We have gym at our office.  I work nights but, uh, it's either I have to go in at like two o'clock in the afternoon and all the day shift people are running everywhere or it's, you know, four o'clock in the morning and it's too hard to, like, get up the motivation to do any real work at four AM.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess then you have more people with you and company with someone as a friend then it's more -- you're more motivated to exercise, isn't it?
L:  Yeah, exactly.  I drive my boyfriend -- I'm like, "Come, let's go to the pool".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Swim back and forth across the pool.
R:  Yeah, but there's one thing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I notice that it's really, like, you know, it helps me reduce my weight on my lower legs were I tend to put on much more. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.
R:  And I find it much -- I -- and I feel good once I -- once I've started walking.  I wasn't, I mean, walking so regularly before --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now, once that I've started it -- it makes me feel good.
L:  Yeah, definitely.  I mean, when I was in school I did fencing.  Like that was the best stretch relief ever was to get up everyday and go down to the gym --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and swing my sword around, you know, run back and forth across the gymnasium.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh  [MN].
R:  No, uh, I tried learning swimming but then I had to kinda give up because there was a bad incident and then my parents didn't quite like it.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, then -- oh, now I'm kinda learning how to swim.
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's really good for you.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's another good form.
L:  You get a lot of leg, full body, exercise and that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I tried doing, uh, the treadmill but then it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- seems like too good for me because, like, I felt, like, you know, I was kinda [several inaudible words]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Was worse for the second time and then after some time I kind of felt very tired.  Like, you know, here walking isn't good at slow pace and I slowly kind of increase it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so your pace has to be kind of constant.
L:  Yeah.  I've always like walking outside best.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I live way down in Texas so it's, like, hills and trees.
R:  Yeah, we're out here in Iowa and it's quite nice, like I come back from a different background altogether in India.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  Uh, so there exercising is not so much of a thing, like, you know --
L:  Really.
R:  -- here everybody's into health and fitness and finally I've also got into it like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] -- and it helps me, like, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like I feel good knowing that I've done -- you know, I start -- you know, I started, out, uh, biking with my son --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- it will have me lose more calories [LAUGH] so --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Oh, biking is like the greatest thing.  That's what I did all through my childhood, rode my bike everywhere.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Mm.
R:  But one thing that --
L:  Great legs back then.
R:  -- I must really say is that, you know, now that I have started walking, like, I try to lose weight a little bit on my l- on my legs --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and my thighs --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I tried dieting but it didn't work.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] You know, because you lose on the top half but with walking as a form of exercise it really helps you [NOISE] and I lost much more than like, you know, having dieted all the time.
L:  Yeah, exactly, it's definitely better for you, I think.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Eat good food, run around outside.  I find it a lot easier to exercise in the summer time 'cause there's sun --
R:  It's much, much more easier.
L:  Yeah.
R:  In winter the weather is -- logically you really can't exercise --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so the only thing that I do is, like, you know, I take my sun out and we just walk around the block a little bit or something like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because by then both so frozen. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, that's right, you get snow.
R:  [MN]
L:  Oh man.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I can't imagine.  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  What -- have you tried out anything new?  I tried skipping a little bit.
L:  Yeah, I, uh -- I used to do a lot of gymnastics --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so I'm trying to find out, like, a course where I can sort of do that for fun.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, because I really like being able to put my feet behind my head, that was a great trick [LAUGH].
R:  Oh yeah.  No, gymnastics is -- I enjoy watching it but I've never really had a chance to learn how to doing anything of gymnastics.
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's pretty good for you to- it's pretty -- like, it's not a really active get your heart rate up thing but it's definitely good for, like, your joints.
R:  I guess that exercises each and every part of your body and your muscle, doesn't it?
L:  Yeah, you stretch everything out and by the time you're done you feel like a donut. [MN]
R:  All your muscles are really loosen out.
L:  Yeah.  That was always a lot of fun for me.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Because it was, like, concentration on, like, the physical aspect of what I was doing, kind of like really meditative and soothing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, I guess it's kinda like yoga in that way.
R:  [MN] Yeah.  Yoga, done a little bit of yoga but not too much.  You have to really, like, you know, concentrate and be, uh -- you have to follow a regular routine --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or regimen when you're doing yoga because once you've stopped that then it loses all effect and you tend to gain the weight that you've already lost.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's like something like an Indian dance that we call Barsinartium[?] or other forms of Indian classic dance --
L:  Cool.
R:  -- which are very good forms of exercise.  But once you stop doing that you tend to put on a lot of weight again.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I used to dance a lot, I loved it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It was one of my favorite things in high school.
R:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  I'm a left footed dancer [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- or you can say two left feet, both at the same time [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, as long as you look like you're having fun no one notices.
R:  Yeah, I just went, uh, once around the floor and, okay, nobody really notices, like, in a crowd. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  I tried to --
R:  Have you tried --
L:  -- convince my boyfriend that --
R:  -- power -- uh, power walking or something --
L:  -- it was --
R:  -- power weight walking?
L:  I've never tried that.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, I haven't tried it either but I ha- have read about it and then the in thing now I heard is Pilates. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] oh.
R:  Like, everybody -- like so many of my friends who I know they have wanted to Pilates, trying the Pilates workout [inaudible].
L:  Yeah.  I've heard good things about that too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It seems real exciting.  I keep -- you know, I -- I'm waiting for all my company benefits to come in so I can start using all the gym services because they have classes.
R:  Uh-huh.  So, you have a gym within your office.
L:  Yeah, yeah, it's down on the first floor.
R:  That's good.  Like, it helps you kinda relax [inaudible] something, doesn't it?
L:  Yeah, it is nice.  Like, you -- you have a long day you can just go downstairs and beat on the punching bag [LAUGH] or run on the treadmill.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  And forget all about whatever you've been doing.
R:  I've kinda joined the Y right now --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so -- so then I take my son out there and we both learn swimming.
L:  Oh, that sounds cool.
R:  So, we just started that up.  Hopefully we both can be good swimmers by the time this is all over. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Like, my mom, she had a weight problem --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and she had high blood pressure and but once she started walking, which she said was the best thing, it helped her lose around twenty pounds or so --
L:  That's cool.
R:  -- but all it needed around six months. [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.
R:  She used to do a lot of walking.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then my dad does it every morning too.  Uh, like it's kind of in the family to do a lot of walking now --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- physical hard workouts.  Like, we try and do that.
L:  That's cool.  And how old is your son?
R:  My son is seven and a half.
L:  Oh, cool.  And you take him with you when you go walking.  
R:  Yeah, we both walk and walk.  And he loves to walk.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, more than that I make him bike so that I can kind of, you know, have to run a little bit after him.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, my pace is faster and I like doing that.  I really like doing that.  We got for an hour or so and by the time we come back we both tired and hungry. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And then we eat practically ...
