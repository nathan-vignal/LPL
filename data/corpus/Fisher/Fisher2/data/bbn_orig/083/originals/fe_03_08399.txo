R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hi, I'm Brock.
R:  Oh, okay, I -- I -- I didn't get that.  I'm Deanna, what was that?
L:  It -- it was like, uh, health and fitness.
R:  No, no, no, I didn't get your name.
L:  Oh, Brock.
R:  Brock, okay.  Hi, Brock, how you doing?
L:  I'm all right.
R:  [LAUGH] It's pretty late, Brock.  Do you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- stay up late?
L:  Well, it's, uh, one on my free nights on my cellphone.
R:  Okay, I see.  Okay, well, um, it's about health and fitness and if -- if we do it or not.  Okay --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- do you exercise?
L:  No, I really don't, um, I really don't exercise a whole lot, I think about it, but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- real- it's, you know, it's one of those things I've decided is not for me.
R:  Yeah, well, you know, for me, basically, I -- I stretch --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, um, I have a high metabolism normally --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, like, putting on weight for me is actually hard to do --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but -- but then I th- I -- a- after I re- you know, [MN] aft- after twenty five, you know, then -- then it -- it -- then it all stops, you know [LAUGH] and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [inaudible]. [LAUGH] But, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] yeah, but, uh, no, but right now, I'm -- I'm at a normal weight, you know, but I --I pretty much just stretch, you know, like, I'm s- I want to, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, I definitely want to, like, do something, like --
L:  Well, I -- I took, uh, martial arts for a couple of months, uh, Aikido, it kinda works me out for a little bit, I just didn't have the time for it, though.
R:  We- we- [MN] yeah, and -- and is that because, what, uh, of work, or --
L:  Well, I was a -- I was a -- it's my, um, sophomore year of college.
R:  Okay, I see.  Okay, yeah, well, I mean, yeah, before, I didn't, I mean -- I mean, I'm -- I'm, you know, I'm only twenty eight, I didn't have ti- uh, you know, time for it, either before, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] but, um, until, uh, the doctors actually found something wrong with my bone marrow, that's when I, like, I -- I didn't exercise at all --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because I was on a lot of medication and I basically couldn't move over the days, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, um, since then I've been taken off that and I, you know, I do stretching, you know, like, but I really don't have the time to and I think sometimes it's easier if you have someone else that does it with you, because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if you don't -- if you don't feel like doing it, you know, they'll drag you along.
L:  Yeah.  Well, there's, like, a health club right down the street and I actually think about going there, not to really, you know, exercise, but I always enjoy the juices and stuff they --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- serve there.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Which kind of juices do you drink?
L:  Oh, you know, just, like the ha- [MN] I --
R:  Wha-
L:  -- always enjoy, like, the healthy milkshakes --
R:  Okay, yeah, I -- those, okay.  Did you ever try Red Bull?  It's an energy drink.
L:  [NOISE] I'm sorry?
R:  Have -- did you ever try Red Bull?  I'm just curious, it's an energy drink.
L:  No, no, I've never --
R:  It's a --
L:  -- tried it.
R:  -- tiny little can, a- I thought it was alcohol at first and that's why I didn't take it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it's actually pretty good, but, um, [LIPSMACK] I -- yeah, there's -- there's a -- a -- a fitness club not too far away from me, um, but then again, it's -- it's -- it's not too far, but it is -- it is a walk, so I think my --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- exercise would be done walking there, [LAUGH] you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, um, I'm not, I mean, ye-
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a lot of the time, yeah, because of, you know, the condition that I have -- and it's not, it's only in -- it's only in, like, one part of my area, you know, like, if someone twirls a hula-hoop --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- like, around their bellies, like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's in those, but it's in those bones --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- and those bones can get very painful sometimes --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and so that would stop me, but because I was so heavy last, uh, last year, I, you know, my son, um, is -- is, m- you know, we're not, is n- is -- is not with, i- me -- [MN] me and his father are not together, basically, you know, he comes --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he goes back and forth, he hadn't seen me for a while and he said, "Oh my God, mommy, you need to lose weight", I mean and he had never said anything like that to me before.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] So, I was like, wow, if he's telling me this I better, [LAUGH] so I got off those meds and I got on ones that don't put you to sleep and, um, I don't do it regularly, bu- but when it, you know, like, when -- when I look at food or I, you know, eat a lot I try to, like, do something to compensate.
L:  Mhm.  Well, like, you know, if you have an indulgent meal then you just work out a little bit harder the next day.
R:  Yeah, yeah, that's what I do.  But -- but, I wouldn't call it working out, [inaudible] --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- so much working out as, you know, I mean I -- I do things around the house and, you know, that's exercise in itself, you know, I just ask my mom to basically, um, um, like, "Hey, why don't we go walking together?", you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, you know, brisk walking, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, to -- when it's not so humid, because it's really humid here in New -- oh, I'm not sure if you're in New York or not, but --
L:  Oh, I'm in California.
R:  -- okay, it is humid, it's like you're in a sweat bath here--
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- as soon as you go outside, it's horrible, so, [LAUGH] you know, I always --
L:  Well --
R:  -- wa- [MN] you --
L:  Well --
R:  -- go ahead.
L:  -- I've always -- what I've always seen people do with that is, like, they'll go, um, jogging, like, power walking in malls.
R:  In malls?
L:  Yeah, like, before the -- like, most malls will open at, like, ten AM and, you know, they open their doors, the actual inside at, like, around, like eight, or seven in the morning --
R:  Really?
L:  -- so, um, you know, you got a nice air conditioned environment --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- to, like, go power walking around in, um, do a few laps, um, and --
R:  I've --
L:  -- there's --
R:  -- never knew that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] That is such -- such good information for me, thank you, I'm gonna look into that.  Wow.  Okay, well, then that's, I mean, yeah, because over he- -- here it's just, like, it's so hard to exercise outside, so inside --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I -- I just basically, like, you know, ye- if you look at a --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- animal, as soon as an animal, after they lay down, you notice instinctively they stretch when they stand up --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I don't always do that and I -- I -- I'm, like, "Wait a minute, maybe I should be doing that", you know? [LAUGH] So, I try to do it when I remember --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but, um, if I see my -- my weight is -- is the perfect weight right now, if I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if I see it go up, like, one pound, I will, like, go -- go right to the gym, that would be it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but then again, you know, muscle also puts on weight --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so I --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- don't know what it -- what it is, but everybody says I look fine, so I take it as that, but I still always wanna, you know, I don't wanna ever lose that, 'cause when I was twenty one I could eat whatever I wanted to and sleep and -- and nothing ever, you know, happened --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, now, you know [MN] --
L:  Well, I think it's more important, like, um, you know, people worry about their weight, where I figure if you're worried about that, you might as well be worried about your [inaudible] since most --
R:  About your what?  About --
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  I'm sorry, you said about your weight and -- and your what?
L:  Uh, your, like, overall appearance, like, if you --
R:  Right.
L:  -- if you weigh two, two ten --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but, you know, you look fine, there's no reason to fret over your weight.
R:  See --
L:  Because, I mean, muscle weighs more than fat, so you can be muscular --
R:  Ri- it's very --
L:  -- and --
R:  -- true.  That's very --
L:  -- be --
R:  -- true.
L:  -- fairly thin, but still weigh a lot.
R:  That's very true.  I -- I -- we- bu- but when I was -- well, I never got up to two ten, but, I -- I was up to one, like, [MN] one eighty and everybody was -- I didn't think I looked heavy at all, that's because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I was on medica- [LAUGH] I [inaudible] look fine, you know, but when I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- look at the pictures now, I'm like, "Oh, my God", you know, like, it just didn't look -- it didn't look healthy, you know, i-
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it didn't look like a -- it didn't look like weight, it looked like medication, like, bloating, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like that kind of bloating, so, um, [LIPSMACK] I definitely, you know, had to -- had to put an end to that and, you know, lose that -- lose that weight, I had to, and I still have more to go, I have seven more pounds on my -- on, you know, to my goal --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- goal. [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.
R:  Even though the doctor tells me I'm fine now, seven more pounds till -- till my --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- goal, but because of my condition it's a little hard.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, I mean, you know, I see people, you know, who run, you know, yo- you know, doing running, like, where I live it's ki- you have to ki- there's a -- a park, but in this humidity by the time you get to the park, you'll be passed out.
L:  Yeah --
R:  That's running.
L:  -- you drink a lot, you just have to drink a lot of water --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Water --
L:  -- yeah.
R:  -- a lot of water, that's exactly, y- you're so right.  So, that's what I'm go- going to start doing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'm -- I'm going to start, um, you know, filling up m- you know, my [inaudible] spring bottles and -- and just, like, running, mm, you know ...
