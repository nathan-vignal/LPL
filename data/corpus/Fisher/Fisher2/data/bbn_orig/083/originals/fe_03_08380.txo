L:  Uh, okay, okay, Liz.
R:  Okay, where are you at?
L:  In New York.
R:  I'm in New York too.
L:  Oh, really.
R:  Yeah, I'm in the Bronx.
L:  You're in the Bronx?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm in Manhattan.
R:  Oh, okay then.
L:  Okay.
R:  All right.  So, do you exercise?
L:  I -- I do, um, uh -- I -- uh -- I actually walk a lot --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I -- I, um -- I don't -- I don't run or play any sports really.
R:  Right.
L:  Uh, becau- --
R:  Well, I --
L:  -- because I had a heart problem a couple of years ago.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Um --
R:  So, walking is good for you --
L:  -- which was probably for lack of -- for lack of not having any exercise.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Uh, but I -- I -- I walk a lot, but not stroll, I try to walk fast, you know.
R:  Okay.
L:  Except in the last week or two [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's been so damned hot.
R:  'Cause the weather and the sun, right?
L:  Right.  What about you?
R:  Well, I, um, just start recently doing exercise 'cause I'm trying to lose my stomach --
L:  Right.
R:  Um, I've been playing patterball --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- but, um, I live in a walk up --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- I live on a top floor so I definitely get exercise every day, I've been doing this for a year.
L:  How many floors?
R:  Um, I'm on the fifth floor.
L:  Fifth floor?
R:  Yes --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and for each fl- -- and for -- there's like, sixteen steps to each floor.
L:  Oh, that's quite a walk.
R:  Yes.
L:  All right.
R:  [LAUGH] Plus, you know, I walk -- I work -- I work in, um, down on, um, by ground zero --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so on my lunch breaks I --
L:  Oh, you walk down by the old World Trade Center?
R:  Yes, mhm.
L:  Right.
R:  I walk around the block twice on my lunch break, you know, prevent me from spending money.
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Like, you usually spend money when you're going for a walk --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- and you see something you like --
R:  -- yeah, but I try to keep the focus stay far away, just walk around, walk around.
L:  Right.
R:  But, um, I think exercising is very good.  At my age, as I'm getting older --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, you know, when we was young we used to just play like little -- little odds and ends -- little exercise jumping --
L:  Right.
R:  -- jack and stuff, but it's true that as you get a little older we need to just continue to, you know, take more exercise.
L:  Right.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, you know, like, especially like you said, when you have health issues, like I'm a --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- diabetic --
L:  Oh, you are?
R:  -- but I can't really over exert myself, but I try --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to do little -- little exercises like sitting in your chair at your desk --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- do a little bend back, stretch the arms out --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, and turn the fists in, well I learned that from watching TV the other morning.
L:  Oh, you did?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, how do you get to work?
R:  Well, I take the number four train, which is about two flight -- two long stairs up to the -- to the platform.
L:  And how far from your home?
R:  Um, I'm -- from work?
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- I'm about --
L:  -- no, da- --
R:  -- forty five minutes.
L:  No, no, no, from your -- from your home to the subway station in the Bronx?
R:  Um -- um, one block.
L:  Oh, it's only a block?
R:  One block, but it's the --
L:  Right.
R:  -- stairs -- it's the stairs.
L:  Right.
R:  There's twenty, forty, there's about forty steps up until you get to the token booth --
L:  Oh, really.
R:  -- and then by the time you -- you go through the turnstile --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you have to pi- -- take another twenty steps.
L:  Oh, so it's -- so you're doing a lot of s- steps?
R:  I do a lot of step climbing --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  So --
R:  And, you know, living in the Bronx, you climb a lot of hills up here.
L:  You do?
R:  Yeah, there's nothing flat up here.
L:  No, well that's good too then, that's good for exercise.
R:  Yeah, mhm.
L:  And what about eating, uh, for --
R:  Well, right now I'm trying to use the Dr. Atkins diet.
L:  Right.
R:  Uh, right now I'm crashing, where that --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- means I'm -- I'm leaving all starches --
L:  Right.
R:  -- breads, um, and just eating salads and fruits.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Uh, it's a two weeks crash --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and then after that and I -- I'm entitled to eat as much as I want of meats --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, you know, nuts, um, not no starches --
L:  Right.
R:  -- just trying to --
L:  How long -- how long ago did you start?
R:  I started this Sunday.
L:  Oh, this -- this weekend?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Right.
R:  So, do you know, I'm feeling kind of energetic --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, just to lose some of this weight, 'cause, like I say, I'm a diabetic, so I got to really --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- try to work on a good diet plan for myself.
L:  Right.  So, you're not eating any meat at the moment, though?
R:  Um, no, just salads --
L:  Uh.  Right.
R:  -- salads.
L:  Well, I had very -- I had , uh -- I was, uh -- I was a smoker --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- um, and, uh, I had quite high cholesterol --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- uh, so -- and I had a -- a heart problem, I had to have a s- an operation, a stent implant.  I was going to have a bypass and then it was decided that I didn't --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- warr- it didn't warrant it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, I'm much more careful what I eat, not that I ate -- I never ate really badly anyway, uh --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- you know, in the sense of cholesterol and fatty, fatty foods, but of course --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I enjoyed things like that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, I [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I -- I eat, uh, these days, you know, a lot of chicken with the skin off and a lot of vegetables, fruit --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- uh --
R:  Steamed vegetables?
L:  Yes --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- exactly.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, and I make a lot of curry dishes where there's no fat in -- in a --
R:  Curry?
L:  -- yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  Vegetable curry dishes.
R:  Oh, that sounds good.
L:  That's good --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and too --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and there's n- no fat in that so, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so that's good, uh, um, well I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, what I --
R:  Well, that's -- mhm, but like they say, exercise is very good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Right.
R:  So, where do you work at?
L:  Oh, I -- I live on, um -- on the East Side -- on Seventieth Street --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- on the East Side and I work on the West Side --
R:  All right.
L:  Um, on, uh -- on Fifty eighth Street and Seventh Avenue --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so I usually walk to work too.
R:  Oh, all right --
L:  And -- and w- --
R:  -- that's good exercise.
L:  -- yeah, that's -- that's a reasonable walk and --
R:  How many hours is that?
L:  Uh, how -- how long does it take me?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, it only takes me, if I walk really fast, twenty five minutes --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- from here, but I walk home too.
R:  And when you're cruising?
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  When you're just slow walking?
L:  Oh, I would take half an hour at least.
R:  A half an hour --
L:  Yeah, about that, so ...
R:  -- oh, all right.  Well, it sounds like you're getting a lot of exercise.
L:  Well, it's something, right?
R:  Yeah, it's -- it's --
L:  And I walk to the Park a lot too.
R:  Oh, it didn't -- you know, yeah, you're getting plenty of exercise.
L:  Right.
R:  And that's good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know --
L:  I think.
R:  -- you just don't do nothing too strenuous, you know.  Now, tonight is a very beautiful night --
L:  Oh, isn't it --
R:  -- it's --
R:  -- oh, I couldn't believe it, it's got so cold now.
R:  I'm telling you this weather's so funny, this is a good night to go out for a really long walk.
L:  No, you cou- you couldn't walk much in this, the last week or two --
R:  No.
L:  -- right --
R:  It --
L:  -- it was much too hot.
R:  Yeah, you'd try to find a air conditioned place real quick.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Anywhere you can jump into.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] So, uh, yeah --
R:  But --
L:  -- so how long are you on this diet for?
R:  I'm -- I'm going to be [NOISE] -- he- -- uh, hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Yeah, I'm going to be on this diet, I said I started Sunday --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, um, in two weeks, or about -- not this Sunday but the following Sunday, I go weigh myself and see if I lost any weight.
L:  Oh, you didn't weigh yourself yet?  No, no --
R:  Yes, I wore my -- I weighed myself already in the beginning.
L:  Oh, you did?
R:  Yes, I'm two thirty three.
L:  Right
R:  So, now I'm just hoping -- um, my goal -- my goal is at least to come down to at least one seventy five, that's my goal.
L:  That's within two weeks?
R:  Um, no, no, no, not --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- in two weeks, but that's my goal, I want to get to one --
L:  Oh, eventually?
R:  -- seventy five.  Yeah --
L:  Eventually, yeah.
R:  -- yeah, eventually I'm going to be one seventy five.
L:  Right.
R:  So, you know, it's just something I'm keeping the focus on so that once in my life I'm going to try to do something and f- and fulfill it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and exercise is definitely is including in this.
L:  Well, you don't smoke?
R:  Uh, no, mhm, no.
L:  No, uh, but did you go on a diet before?
R:  Oh, I've been on all kinds of diets.  I've been on crashing diets; I've been on a grapefruit diet --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, there's even been a lot of times when I didn't eat 'cause I said, "Well, maybe I'm meant to just eat". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, but, um, [LIPSMACK] I just tried to, like, really, really, really, since I've been reading Dr, um -- Dr Atkins' book --
L:  Right.
R:  -- his last one --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, it's really interesting, it's really, like I said, I'm a diabetic so I really have to really, um -- how he said, stay on a good strict diet.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm seeing a nutritionist, but she's not helping me.  You know, it's like, where we -- you got to, uh, weigh your food and count how many -- how many slices of green peppers and --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- you don't have no time for that and I don't --
L:  No.
R:  -- need that, so I'm hoping -- I've been hearing a lot of -- you know, there's a lot of good people who did the diet --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, and um, have heard from them and they said they have -- they have lost it, so that's the reason why I'm going to take advantage of it and see how it is.
L:  Right, right.
R:  I'm going to lose this weight no matter what I have to do.
L:  Right.
R:  'Cause, you know, with this heat, it was very sluggish --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- um, with the heavy weight on --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- oh, my god, you feel like you're going to pass out.
L:  Right, it --
R:  I'm feeling it now, you know, I wasn't feeling it before.
L:  No, but you're -- it's -- it's not good for you.
R:  No, it's not.
L:  No.  Did you eat badly before you went on this Atkins diet, or ...?
R:  Well, no -- because I live alone --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so I really don't cook no big me- meals, I just, like, really, how you say, snack in between --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you nibble here --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you to lunch, you have yourself a nice -- nice, you know, like, probably McDonald's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or Burger King.
L:  Right.
R:  Then I come home at night and I probably grab some thing from the fast food place --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I come home, but, like, all that adds up the rice[?].
L:  That's, uh -- that's fast food.
R:  Yeah, that fast food's a --
L:  Tastes good -- tastes good but it's not good.
R:  No, right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I haven't even been to the restaurant and, I mean, I pass by it every [NOISE] -- every night when I come home --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- my favorite restaurant, but I'm just --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- passing by it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because it's mainly nothing but rice and beans and pork, rice and beans and chicken --
L:  Right.
R:  -- rice and beans and salad, so it's --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- too much rice and beans.  So --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- the beans is -- is something that I -- that I notice is not in the diet 'cause I guess it's starchy too.
L:  Oh, that's f- -- that's true.
R:  Mhm.  So, I'm -- I'm eliminating -- I'm really -- I'm really working on this. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right.  Well, that's terrific.
R:  Yes, and some --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- day --
L:  That's terrific.  Well, I don't have to go on a diet 'cause I'm only a hundred and fifty pounds anyway.
R:  Oh, that --
L:  I ha- I have been for years --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- uh, I mean, nothing to do with my heart problem when I was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I was, uh, about a hundred and fifty pounds then, maybe a hundred and fifty five.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, I don't have to go on a diet, but I've got to be very careful what I eat.
R:  Oh, what you eat, definitely.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, even I look at the people wh- who are small people, they got to -- to watch what they eat.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, I've seen girlfriends -- I went, like, I [several inaudible words] I couldn't have -- understand this girl, how does she keep herself so slim --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and when she gets a hamburger --
L:  Right.
R:  -- she just eats the meats and the lettuce and tomato and let -- and eliminate the bread.
L:  Oh, she doesn't eat the bread at all?
R:  She don't eat the bread at all --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the rice -- she'll eat the -- whatever they'll --
