L:  [NOISE] Hello.
R:  Victor.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  My name's --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- Victor.
L:  Uh, I'm Jennifer.
R:  Hi.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, uh, do you know anything about this, uh, thing going on?  Uh, they called me earlier today [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I did one, then I called back in and it's the same thing.  Can you do that, or what?
L:  I -- I don't know.  I've never done one, you know, twice in --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- one day but I -- I have done it before.
R:  Yeah, they -- they called me because I just signed up online, because I was just, uh, doing, uh, search [NOISE] engine for surveys and things --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to make money online and the only thing I get, is like, uh, surf bar things where you download the surf bars and you look at the surf bars.  Well, most of the time when you look at them surf bars, you got to be surfing all the time and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and you just leave for a second, it, uh, goes to a red light or whatever and then I get paid emails and they don't pay that much.  They only pay you like one or two cents and you gotta have like a three hundred dollar check before they send you a check --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- for like three hundred dollars --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- or five hundred dollars, or whatever it is.  So, I get these surveys [NOISE] and the only ones I bumped in was, uh, Pinecone Research, where they give you a survey like every [NOISE] month or every two months, where they only pay you five dollars and you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- log onto an account --
L:  Oh, hm.
R:  -- in, uh, Pinecone Research and the other one is called American Consumer Option, or something and that one's, uh, only [NOISE] eight dollars and the other one was, uh, they had Chicago ones, where you go out there and they pay you but you got to qualify over the phone and sometimes --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- when you don't answer the right answers, or whatever it is, whatever the computer says --
L:  Oh, do you, uh --
R:  -- you -- you don't qualify or whatever, so ...
L:  Do you live in Chicago?
R:  No, I -- I -- I'm out here by, uh -- yeah, I'm out here by -- about fifty miles from Chicago, outside of Chicago, over here.
L:  Oh, I went -- I went to college in Peoria, so ...
R:  Yeah.  I got to go back to this website and see, uh, later on, find out, you know, if you could do the same survey again [NOISE].  I don't know because they --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- called me earlier.  I --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- gave them my cell phone number [NOISE] because I -- you know, my home phone, I usually, [NOISE] uh, [NOISE] plug that in the internet and you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I'm surfing all the time, so how can you answer your home phone?  It's not gonna go and pop up a message on your computer and they don't do [NOISE] email on that --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- stuff, so, I -- I -- I gave them my cell phone number for a secondary --
L:  Well, maybe you'll --
R:  -- number.
L:  -- get paid twice. [LAUGH]
R:  For a cell phone?  I don't think so [LAUGH].  Huh, I don't think --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so -- but I know, I don't like to -- I don't like to waste the minutes because, [NOISE] uh --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- [NOISE] like after nine [NOISE] o'clock at night and the weekends, it's any time minutes.  You know what I'm saying?  It's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's like it's unlimited.  You know, before [NOISE] I had three thousand minutes, now I got unlimited.  But during the day, I only get seven fifty but if this is going to be only ten minutes, it's gonna pay ten dollars but you got to wait, you know, do three of them -- you got to wait to do three of them before they mail you a check, I guess.
L:  Well --
R:  But, uh --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know, I -- I don't think I'm gonna worry about it, so ...
L:  Hm.  So --
R:  If I go over --
L:  -- do you work out --
R:  -- that.
L:  -- regularly?
R:  Uh -- uh, you know, health clubs or whatever?
L:  Yes.
R:  No, [LAUGH] I'm really a couch potato.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  'Cause --
L:  I --
R:  -- uh, you know --
L:  -- well, I go to the gym but ya --
R:  Oh, yeah, y- you -- who -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- are you one of them, uh, all fit and everything else --
L:  Well, no --
R:  -- because you're --
L:  -- well, I'm somewhat --
R:  -- slim and everything.
L:  -- fit. [SIGH] [NOISE]
R:  Yeah but, uh, I was thinking about joining a health club too but when I went to the health club in my local area -- we have these health clubs out here called Gold's Gym or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Power House.  Another one's w- -- I just moved over to this town -- it's called, uh -- it -- it [NOISE] doesn't have a chain name thing, whatever it's called --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Muscle and Fitness.  They wanted like forty five dollars a month --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but they said they gotta -- you -- if you don't have a credit card checking account where they could automatically [NOISE] debit every month -- if you don't [NOISE] have a ch- -- a credit card --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- checking account, they want the whole twelve months, six hundred dollars in advance, in cash.
L:  [NOISE] Hm, wow.
R:  An- and -- and I tell -- I tell myself, "What if you don't like it?" or something --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know what I'm saying?
L:  Yeah they, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I -- I belong --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- to a gym [NOISE] in the town next to where I live and, uh, [NOISE] it's twenty nine dollars a month but the bad thing was, you had to sign up for two years and I hated that. [SIGH] I didn't -- I thought it was only one year and then I looked at the contract, it was two, so -- and if you want to leave, you have to pay like a hundred bucks, [NOISE] or something like that.  I --
R:  Oh, yeah --
L:  -- don't anticipate --
R:  Wa- was yours on a credit card checking account?
L:  No, well, they deduct it right from my checking account.
R:  Yeah, from checking, no.  So, you had --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a -- a contract thing, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they said if you want to leave early, they're gonna charge you, right?
L:  Yeah, I'll have to pay like a hundred dollars, or something like that.
R:  Oh, that -- that's messed up.  So, I guess, yeah, we just gonna have to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [NOISE] just see -- I guess the people out there are just gonna have to join it for whatever [NOISE] the contract is, twelve months --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- or whatever it was.
L:  Yeah, some of the -- some of the clubs --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- around here though, they only, um -- they charge [NOISE] -- it's month to month.  Like I used to belong to a club before I moved, [NOISE] that was month to month and you just had to give something like sixty days or a night, or --
R:  Yeah, this -- this one in my area right here is -- is -- is, uh -- they said that you could try it out but it's only one free day, that's it, you know.  
L:  Oh.
R:  One -- one free day.  But I'm saying [NOISE] if it's like you says on the phone, that you got to have a checking account credit card, uh, and then if you -- you don't have that, you can't pay month to month cash, or whatever.  You got to pay, the whole six -- the whole twelve months, which is six hundred dollars.  That's just, uh --
L:  Yeah, well, I don't have, uh -- they didn't need like a debit card.  They just automatically deb- -- they au- -- they just [NOISE] deduct it directly from my checking account.
R:  Yeah, yeah, that's -- that -- you could use that.  You could -- you, uh, either give them a checkbook or you could give them [NOISE] a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, your -- your check card.  It's like a debit --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- card, so --
L:  Well, I --
R:  -- it's almost --
L:  -- have one of those, so ...
R:  Yeah, it's -- it's almost the same thing as a credit card.  A credit card, I can't get because I got, uh, messed up credit.  I don't have bankruptcies or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or, uh -- or what do they call them?  Judgments or whatever.  I have just, you know, negative credit because I haven't built up my credit and --
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  -- I might have --
L:  -- understand.
R:  -- like -- I might have like, uh, hospital bills or doctor bills, or something in the past but not --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- serious stuff.  But they just won't approve me --
L:  Well and see --
R:  -- because you gotta have probably a certain amount of money you make, or whatever but the thing [NOISE] is, I could get these security cards and I could put the two hundred dollars down on the security card and they will mail it to me.  It's [NOISE] like a credit card but you -- you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you've got to put money towards it, so ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it's the regular credit -- credit cards different from a debit card, so ...
L:  Yeah.  Well, I -- I just primarily use my debit card if I don't have the cash for it.  I don't buy it, so [LAUGH] -- and it's, you know, expensive to live in the area of the country I live in, so ...
R:  Yeah, and in the area that I just moved in -- 'cause, uh, the area -- I was out there for like ten or fifteen years.  I just moved to my area where I grew up at --
L:  And where --
R:  -- back there ten or fifteen years later, I moved back to my area where [NOISE] I grew up at [NOISE].  You know, [NOISE] around the area --
L:  And where did you --
R:  -- that I grew up.
L:  -- live before?
R:  I lived out in a [NOISE] city called Waukegan and, uh, I stayed out there for like ten or fifteen years and I -- I could have had the first month's rent and security deposit and moved back here but they didn't.  But ten or fifteen years later, I'm back to my hometown --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but you know, uh, it doesn't make any sense.  But when I was out there, the point is, they had DSL and they had a cable internet [NOISE] thing.  You go to this --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- town, [NOISE] they don't have nothing except dialup --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and, uh, it's -- y- you try and look for a DSL or a cable internet that goes through your cable line, or DSL and you just can't find anything and they said --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- they'll gonna have it available [NOISE] but they don't if it's gonna be the first of the year, or after the first of the year but --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- wh- whoever lived out here before, they had to suffer.  You know what I'm saying?  Because they have to deal with --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the, you know, the dialup stuff -- the dialup stuff.  If you don't watch your stuff, you know, it disconnects you, plus you can't watch movies and -- and -- and do this --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and do that and everything else and the --
L:  Yeah, well, I don't --
R:  -- stuff like that.
L:  -- need fancy internet connection.  I -- I -- I, um -- er, I ge- -- I can get anything I want here.  I -- I live in the Boston area and --
R:  Oh, yeah, so you don't have DSL or cable, huh?
L:  No.  Well, I --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- yeah.  No, I don't have, uh, that type of connection.  I -- I don't know.  I just can't justify it right now, so ...
R:  Yeah, so -- so, you, uh -- you have dialup stuff because you're not -- you're probably not on -- on the, um -- on the thing.  You know what I'm saying?  You know, you're not --
L:  Yeah, I, um -- I, um -- [LIPSMACK] I -- I don't spend -- I spend a lot of time, like my -- I work in front of a computer all day --
R:  Oh, yeah, that's -- well, that's --
L:  -- and, uh --
R:  -- why.  You get enough of computer work.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH], I -- I have about --
R:  Where -- where your job is and ...
L:  Yeah, I have about ten hours and then I go home and I go to the gym. [LAUGH]
R:  Huh.  How long have you been on this survey thing?  I just signed up today and they just called me on my cell phone.  I didn't --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- know it was gonna be that quick.
L:  Well, this is the second one that I've done.
R:  Oh, did --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- did they call you, or what?
L:  They called.  But I'm --
R:  Uh, the --
L:  -- I'm not home --
R:  -- both t- --
L:  -- a lot.
R:  -- b- both times?
L:  Um, well --
R:  D- --
L:  -- the one I did was a while -- or a couple of months ago.  I -- I'm generally not home when they call and, uh --
R:  Okay, so -- but the -- the both times the -- you said, this is the second one, so both times they called you, huh?
L:  Yes.
R:  Uh, so, ya -- so, you get -- you didn't get to your three -- three things --
L:  Oh, no --
R:  -- when they mailed you a check.
L:  -- I got a check after the first one.
R:  Oh, you did?
L:  Yeah, so, I don't know if they changed it or not but, um [NOISE] ...
R:  Oh, you don't know if they changed it because you -- you didn't [NOISE] have three -- three before, when you got the check, or what?
L:  Yes.
R:  You did have three?
L:  No, I didn't.
R:  You didn't.  So, they've changed it now.
L:  Yes.
R:  The, uh, rules and regulations, or whatever it is.
L:  Yes.
R:  I gotta find out, uh, if you, uh, do the certain same survey --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't know.
L:  I don't know.
R:  Oh, I'll have to, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- find out, um -- I don't know.  'Cause I just got them called and, uh, and --
L:  Well, you don't have to --
R:  -- talking to --
L:  -- accept the call if you're busy.  Yeah, you can always --
R:  Oh, no, no.  It's, n- -- it's not that busy.  I -- you know, they rang -- they were ringing on my cell phone and at the time I was trying to nap with sleep 'cause I didn't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- get no sleep.  I'm on this fricken thing all day, trying to play these games online, where you win the jackpot and the chance that you don't win --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- jackpot, you win all these free tokens and, uh, you know, it's just -- just messed up in that.  But -- but anyway, they called me I was trying to get -- uh, take a nap --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and they called --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- me.  Are you there?
L:  Yeah, I'm here.
R:  I heard a click, or something.  Maybe you got a phone call or something --
L:  No, anything[?] --
R:  Uh, but, um, and, uh, [NOISE] so I answered the phone and they -- they said this, uh, was health and fitness.  I talked to some kind of -- I think it was in New Jersey, in New York, or something.  He had some kind of accent.  Anyways, I told him about it --
