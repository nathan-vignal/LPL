L:  [NOISE] Hello. [NOISE]
R:  Hello.
L:  [NOISE] Hi, this is Dimitri.
R:  [NOISE] Hi, this is Joanna.
L:  Hey, how are you?
R:  I'm --
L:  Uh, is this your --
R:  -- fine.
L:  -- is this your first time doing this?
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  All right, this is [LAUGH] -- it's my third, so I'm -- I'm a veteran. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Okay, good. [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  Um, but I guess, I would just -- should start talking [NOISE] about the topic.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, all right, so [LAUGH] do you exercise regularly often? [NOISE]
R:  Um, I was [NOISE] [LAUGH].  I was --
L:  You --
R:  -- going to Curves --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you know, exercise place for women.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  So -- but I have MS, so I've not been able to go for a while.
L:  Oh, I see. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, [NOISE] I, uh [NOISE] -- I go basically every day but, uh, just 'cause it's the summer time and, um, [NOISE] uh, I'm -- I'm interning at this job that's [NOISE] rel- relatively laid back, so, uh, [NOISE] I've, uh, had much more time to go.  But usually --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, I -- I'm -- I'm a college student, so it's m- -- it's more difficult in college 'cause you -- 'cause of the time it actually it asks of you though but, um [NOISE] -- but, uh --
R:  Do you --
L:  Huh?
R:  Do you go to a gym?
L:  Yeah, yeah, I go to a gym, um --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- [NOISE] uh, but, er, the thing is that I don't really -- I don't do it for, um, [NOISE] for the health -- for the health aspect.  Um, I do it more, uh -- if -- if I play sports, I do it just 'cause it's fun. [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  Can you hear me -- can you hear me, by the way?
R:  Yes, I can hear you.
L:  Okay, just 'cause I'm using a headset.  Um --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but, uh, er, yeah, but and also I lift weights and that's not really for health, it just -- just keep by b- body in tone --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, but I guess --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like, uh -- I guess I'm young, so I don't -- I don't have to worry about the health aspects of it yet.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, you know, I -- I guess that's -- that's gonna come soon though, like not -- well, not -- not soon but in [LAUGH] -- in like twenty years or so I'm gonna be, uh, doing it more for health than, uh --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- just for fun.  How -- um, but, um, how 'bout you?  Do you -- when -- when you do go, um --
R:  Oh, I w- -- I go -- when I'm able to go and my health allows me to go, I go three times a week.
L:  [NOISE] Okay.
R:  And it's a thirty minute work out, so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know and it's just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there's a lot of support --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and a lot of stuff --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I've just not been able to go for like the last three -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- well, four weeks now.
L:  Oh, really? [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, well when you -- when you do go, is it, uh -- is it for, uh, health reasons, or is it just to -- to -- you feel better, or ...?
R:  [NOISE] Um, it's probably --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- both, a variety of both, health reasons and also --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I feel better if I'm able to get out and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- exercise.
L:  Yeah, it's --
R:  So --
L:  -- also -- it's also a tool to, um -- to get your mind off of things, uh --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I know we -- at least like in college, like to get your mind off the work and stuff --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and -- and -- and stress, it's -- it's a nice --
R:  Right.
L:  -- outlet to, uh, you know, to either play sports or to -- to go and, uh, lift weights or whatever.  That's --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- a -- a lot of people think like that, so, um, at least for me, you know [NOISE], it's -- it's nice to take your mind off of it and, uh, you know, not think about something.
R:  Uh-huh --
L:  So --
R:  -- how --
L:  -- uh --
R:  -- long are you there when you go, work out?
L:  Um, the thing is -- is that, um, I'm usually, uh, p- perhaps maybe around forty minutes, uh --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- maybe less.  Um, it's just that, er, sometimes I -- I get, um [LIPSMACK] -- I get bored easily --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, just walking [NOISE] around, uh, doing re- repetitions is, uh --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- well, I try -- try -- try -- I try to -- I try to get -- get the bulk of it done in the beginning, um -- hello.
R:  Hello, I'm still --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- here.  I'm --
L:  All right.
R:  -- sorry. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah [LAUGH], no --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I'm just cr- -- I'm -- I'm driving, so, I'm -- I'm crossing a bridge, so I thought I might --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- might -- might -- I might --
R:  All right.
L:  -- have lost you.
R:  You're uh --
L:  But, um, yeah, uh, I try to get the bulk of it done in the beginning because I know that towards the end I'm just gonna start walking around and -- and you know, maybe talk to people.
R:  Right.
L:  So, uh, I try to, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know but, uh, and you -- you -- you do it for thirty minutes?
R:  Yeah --
L:  Er, what --
R:  -- it's like you do an exercise --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you do a machine --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and work on a machine --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and then for thirty seconds and then --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you, uh -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they tell you to switch.  It's a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- circuit --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- training --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you switch and then you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- do like a cool down --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- where you can like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- do a step aerobics, or --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- you know, just walk --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in place.  They have some things, you know, stretches and then you go --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- back to, you know -- and there -- you do it two times around.  I think there's fifteen --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- no, there's twelve, twelve --
L:  [NOISE]
R: -- different --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- machines.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  So --
L:  Well, when you -- when you were younger, did you, uh, do the same thing, or ...?
R:  [LIPSMACK] No, 'cause this is a relatively new --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, thing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that they just started.  In fact, it's one of the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- fastest growing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what I want to say, chains, you know, for --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- and it's just for women --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  And you know but no, I didn't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I didn't really have to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- when I was young.  I --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  -- you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [MN] so, I mean --
L:  But did --
R:  -- other than just --
L:  [NOISE] Did you, uh, you know, just -- did you just work out for fun when you were younger?  Um --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you know --
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  But you know, just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm from a small little town --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know --
L:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
R:  -- growing up, so we just didn't have a place you could go and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and work --
L:  Oh, I see --
R:  -- out.
L:  -- yeah. [NOISE]
R:  So, it was more or less, you know, we played softball --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that kind of stuff, went hiking.  You know, I grew up in the country, so I spent a lot of time --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know --
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
R:  -- hiking, so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh --
L:  Yeah --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I see.  Yeah, I -- I -- I -- I -- I mean, I g- -- I guess, it's opposite.  I -- I'm from New York, so, you know --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I always have something like a gym available.
R:  Right.
L:  So, you know, the -- the option's always there to work out and especially now during the summer, uh, since my internship doesn't demand a lot, at least not at this point.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, there are times when I'm just free during the day [NOISE], or [NOISE] I get my work done quickly and you know, the -- the options available to go work out, so instead of doing [NOISE] nothing, it's better to, you know, go exercise and work your [NOISE] body.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, so --
R:  Mm, you just --
L:  -- um --
R:  -- lift some place else?  I mean, do you go to the gym?  You don't have a weight lifting at home, or ...?
L:  Um, y- yeah, I don't have any weights at home [NOISE].  I just basically --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- use the -- the weight lifting there.  I mean, there are times when I go to my friends place to play soccer, um --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know and I -- obviously I run there -- there but that's -- that's, uh, like maybe once a week and e- every -- every day I just go and lift in -- in gym.  
R:  Mm.
L:  But, um, how old are you, if you don't my asking? [NOISE]
R:  Excuse me?
L:  How old are you, if you --
R:  Oh, I'm forty two.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.  Uh, you s- -- 
R:  And how old --
L:  -- you s- --
R:  -- are you?
L:  Uh, eighteen.
R:  Eighteen, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  You sound m- -- you sound much younger.
R:  Oh, well, thank you. [LAUGH]
L:  Your welcome. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Most people think --
L:  But, um --
R:  -- I sound like my twenty year old when they answer -- when they call, so --
L:  Yeah, that's -- I was [LAUGH] -- yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know but, um --
R:  Well ...
L:  Yeah, so, I guess -- I don't know.  The topic's not very, uh, controversial, you know.
R:  No, this one isn't.  Is it -- I mean, I hear- -- last night, I know there was one but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I didn't have time --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to do it and it, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- sounded better than this one, so ...
L:  Well, what was the topic last night?
R:  The last night was on --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- censorship.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, yeah, [NOISE] that [NOISE] -- I did one yesterday in the afternoon.  I guess, they keep the same topic the whole day and --
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  That was better [NOISE] 'cause you know, you -- it -- it might be like someone other different viewpoints.
R:  [MN]
L:  How consensus is usually, you know.  It's, um -- people agree on health -- health and fitn- -- that fitness is good --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for your health, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  It's not -- it's not if you do it or you don't [NOISE].  But I guess [NOISE] -- I guess they're just, uh, looking at the conversational aspects of, um [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the, uh, exchange that of --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- course -- but, um --
R:  Right.
L:  Well, I guess we both agree that [LAUGH] health and -- that fitness is good for your health.
R:  Right.  I think that it --
L:  Um --
R:  -- really is.  I think you can go -- overdo it, you know --
L:  Yeah, d- -- oh, definitely, yeah.  There --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- are a lot of people who get addicted and just stay in the, uh -- well, in the whole time and you know --
R:  Right.
L:  I g- -- I guess, it's like -- it's like the saying, that, er, um, anything in moderation is -- is -- is good but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, if you go -- go -- go to an extreme, it's ...
R:  Right, not --
L:  It g- -- yeah, it gets --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it gets to the point where it's just -- it's not healthy for you.  Er, it is --
R:  What you're going to school for is not anything to do with, you know --
L:  No.
R:  -- for health, or ...?
L:  Oh, no, no, no --
R:  No?
L:  -- I'm just -- no, I -- I'm, um --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I -- I go to Georgetown but, um --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I'm just, you know, n- nothing with health.
R:  Okay.
L:  I mean, I don't -- my major's physics, it's the farthest thing from, I mean --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- f- fitness, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, um, uh, but I mean, they have a gym there, that's the only thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um, but yeah, I think there's like a term for someone who's, uh -- who's like addicted to working out.  I don't know.
R:  Oh.
L:  Like it meant it -- I don't know.  I heard it the other day [NOISE], um, but I forgot [LAUGH] but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- yeah, it's --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- someone's like addicted and goes work --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- out, like runs --
R:  Goes all the --
L:  -- like --
R:  -- time, mhm.
L:  Yeah, like runs like six times a day --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, which is also not really healthy for you.
R:  No, it's not.  Very obsessive, compul- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- -sive behavior to do that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so, you know and I think you can take it too far, your fitness, like you know, if you do too many of the herbs and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- [inaudible] kind of stuff, you know.  It can --
L:  Oh, and the --
R:  -- but --
L:  -- supplements, like especially like with young kids nowadays --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they have, uh, like Creatine or something like that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, uh, you know, they think like you'll take it and it's, um -- it's a -- it's a quick, cheap way to, uh, gain more muscle when --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in reality, uh, you know, you should try to gain muscle naturally and then --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you should do it the right way instead of trying to do it a cheap way.
R:  And once --
L:  That's a --
R:  -- you've gained the muscle, if you don't keep it, it turns to flab.
L:  Yeah, exactly --
R:  Or if you don't --
L:  -- yeah.
R:  -- continue to work it, you know and so, that's why when people get really older, you know, they're just like -- it's just flabby. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah --
R:  But --
L:  -- yeah.
R:  -- so, mhm.
L:  Especially nowadays, when, um -- when like the media and, uh -- portrays like, you know, the perfect female and the perfect male, if someone's who's -- who's muscular, who's fit --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- you know, who's thin, mm, a lot of people, you know, they look at that and that's the way they want to be, so, they're willing to, uh -- to do anything in -- in some cases, you know.  And you go from, you know, doing healthy [several inaudible words] to just using chemicals to -- to boost your, uh, image.
R:  Right.
L:  You know and instead of being like happy about yourself --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- which you should be, you know, they're --
R:  Right.
L:  -- really something that they're not, which -- which --
R:  And that's what --
L:  -- go through that.
R:  That's what I've always told my girls, "You've got to love yourself before anybody --"
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  "-- else can love you". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's es- -- it's especially harder for girls, I think.  I mean --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- I -- I -- I wouldn't know, 'cause I'm [LAUGH] not a girl but --
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  -- um, you know --
R:  -- my oldest was anorexic, so, when she was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in college, so, I do know that, you know --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- you've got to [NOISE] be very careful if you've got a, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a personality [NOISE] that makes you obsessive about stuff, so --
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, any -- uh, it's, yeah, if it's pers- -- if it's personally like that, or -- but if it's mixed with a personality that's insecure, that's e- -- I mean, that's even worse because --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, if you're insecure about your --
