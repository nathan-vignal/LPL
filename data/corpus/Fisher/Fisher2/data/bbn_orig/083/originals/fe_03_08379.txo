R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Hi, my name is Shirley and --
R:  Hi, my name is Jessica.
L:  I --
R:  [SIGH]  How are you doing?  [SIGH]
L:  I'm doing fine.  I'm in Memphis, Tennessee.
R:  Oh, you're in Memphis, Tennessee.  Oh, great --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I'm in California.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, we're a long ways apart.
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah.  That is a long way, huh?  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Well, [SIGH] --
R:  [SIGH]  So, did you hear about the topic it's about --
L:  I --
R:  -- exercise and [SIGH] --
L:  -- I did about [SIGH] h- health and fitness.
R:  -- health and fitness.  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  But are you in a regular ... exercise --
R:  Um, --
L:  -- program?
R:  -- [SIGH] no, what happened was that, um, [MN] -- ah, I'm on medication and I gained a lot of weight.  [SIGH]  And -- through this medication and then I tried to go to a spa, [SIGH] you know, like a -- like a [NOISE] gym- ah, gymnasium?
L:  Right.
R:  And -- but it's kind of [NOISE] expensive, you know?  [SIGH]
L:  I know.
R:  Health is kind of expensive, you know.  [SIGH]  So, um, [MN] I didn't get to join but I bought some diet pills instead.  [SIGH]  And, they're kind of helping me, you know, with my appetite and everything.  [SIGH]
L:  O- o- oh!
R:  And, um, [SIGH] -- um, I try to exercise but the problem with exercising for me is that I have two broken legs [SIGH] and -- that -- that give me, you know, the -- the -- when it's cold they hurt and, you know -- you know how you have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- problems when you have broken bones [SIGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and they didn't fix one right and, um, [SIGH] -- um, it's -- it's uneven and I walk uneven so I can't hardly do aerobics or anything like that.  So, it's very hard for me to [SIGH] -- to exercise.  I can only do, like, -- maybe like leg lifts or, you know, just really easy arm [SIGH] -- you know, arm circles and things like that.  But I don't [LAUGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm kind of -- I'm kind of lazy in that department.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, I'm afraid --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- I am too.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't, ah, --
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- I don't exercise -- a- ah, I want --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- to w- walk [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah, that's --
L:  -- but I --
R:  -- good.  [SIGH]
L:  -- [SIGH] I have t- trouble w- walking --
R:  Oh, -- oh, --
L:  -- n- now because I --
R:  -- you do?
L:  -- I have --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a- a- arthritis in my knees.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, no.  [SIGH]
L:  [MN]  So, that makes sit hard to walk f- for -- very [SIGH] far.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But ...
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Um ...
R:  I -- you know, i- it -- it's --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- that, you know, you see so many things on TV about fitness and you want -- you get so excited and everything but, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, you have to accept your limitations, you know.  [SIGH]  You know, like, u- um, wi- with my illness and my legs and, [SIGH] you know, being shorter than the other and [SIGH] -- and like, ah, you know some people -- you -- even though I want to be healthy and want to be in shape, [SIGH] you know, it's hard for me to do those things, you know, o- or it's too expensive, [SIGH] you know.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  They make it kind of expensive.  They should have, um, ... f- free places --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- where you can go, you know, like -- because I can swim --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I like to swim, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, and that's good.  That's good exercise, you know, for people that are disabled or, you know, like that.
L:  Right.  Yes.  [NOISE]
R:  Swimming is good exercise.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
R:  I like that and I try to do as much as I can.  But, um, [MN] last year when I went to the, um, -- they have -- they have places free -- well, you know, it's not free but, you know, you pay like a c- couple of dollars to go swimming for a couple of hours, right?
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  But there were so many kids there that you could hardly do a- [LAUGH] anything.  [LAUGH]  You know --
L:  Yeah, I bet --
R:  -- splashing then kicking --
L:  -- like [SIGH] --
R:  -- you and, [SIGH] you know, [LAUGH] s- s- so.  So, --
L:  Like community centers?
R:  Yeah, community center.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And there were so many kids there you can't really ... do anything.
L:  Right, that's --
R:  So, ...  [SIGH]
L:  -- they're geared more for -- more for the children in --
R:  Y- Y- yeah.
L:  -- the summer, I think.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  And I think --
L:  Um, --
R:  -- fitness is good for kids too, you know, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think it's great for, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, them to get out and do things, you know.  [SIGH]  Um, ...
L:  I have a YMCA --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- [SIGH] c- close to me.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Fairly close, --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- and I've considered joining --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the Y [SIGH] --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- just to do the water aerobics.  [SIGH]
R:  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  That would -- I don't -- I can't swim.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, you can't swim.  Oh, no!  [NOISE]
L:  Ah, no.  A- ah, [SIGH] --
R:  [SIGH]  They have lessons don't they?  They have, o- o- oh!
L:  [SIGH]  They do [NOISE] but I'm too old to learn.  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Oh, no, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you're never to old to learn.
L:  Well, --
R:  [SIGH]  Swimming is easy.  It's --
L:  I had --
R:  -- [SIGH] just a matter of being able to float.  [LAUGH]
L:  I just always --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- panicked.  I -- I think --
R:  [SIGH]  Oh, no.  [SIGH]
L:  -- I had a bad experience when I was a child --
R:  Oh, no.  [SIGH]
L:  -- I almost drowned [SIGH] --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and ever since I've -- I've just -- I just panic when my he- -- ah, face gets wet.
R:  Gets wet.  Oh, no.  [SIGH]
L:  I'm afraid I'm gonna -- [SIGH] my head's --
R:  Yeah, that can --
L: -- gonna go under the water.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Oh, that's too bad, huh.  [SIGH]
L:  But I [SIGH] --
R:  I'm sorry --
L:  But I [SIGH] --
R:  -- to hear about that, yeah.  [SIGH]  Yeah.
L:  -- I have s- -- gotten some, um, --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] like, a -- a belt, [SIGH] a water belt --
R:  Uh-huh.  [MN]
L:  -- that you w- -- that you wear --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- like they wear in, um, --
R:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] for therapy.
R:  Right.
L:  That type.  Plus some water --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- shoes, walking that are --
R:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
L:  -- made [SIGH] just for walking --
R:  For water, Uh-huh.
L:  -- in the water.
R:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  I mean they're -- they're special foam shoes.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH] But I -- I've had 'em a couple of years but I haven't used them yet --
R:  [MN]  Oh, no.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- either.  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  So, I -- I should go [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- do the -- the water aerobics.  I think it would be very good --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- exercise.
R:  Yeah, you could just go and maybe just watch for a little [NOISE] while and see if there -- that's kind of type of, um, thing you'd be interested in, you know.  If, you know, [SIGH] -- have you seen it before?  Have you see how they do it?  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, yes.  Yes, --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I have.  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
R:  O- oh, so you know --
L:  They have --
R:  -- then, yeah, w- what i- it's like.
L:  [MN]  Well, --
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, that'd be --
L:  Yeah, a lot --
R:  -- really good to get you --
L:  -- of people, ah, older --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- people who have [NOISE] arthritis --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the, ah, doctors recommend ... the water aerobics.
R:  [SIGH]  Really?
L:  [SIGH]  And -- ah, yes.
R:  [MN]  Oh, that's good, --
L:  Yes.  It's supposed --
R:  -- yeah.
L:  -- to be really good [SIGH] because you can get --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- more exercise under water --
R:  Uh-huh.  It's more --
L:  -- and it doesn't --
R:  -- pressure, like, the air[?].
L:  it's not as painful --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- as walking --
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  -- on concrete.
R:  I think that's true too.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, 'cause when I'm in the water I don't feel hardly pain at all.  Like, -- like, I -- I do, you know, I jump up and down in the water and everything and y- you don't feel the [SIGH] -- 'cause I got bad feet too.  So, ...  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  I get, you know, calluses on my, um, my feet and it's hard to walk sometimes and, um, [MN] -- u- um, [MN] t- the water is like a cushion.  You know it's like a cushion [NOISE] and i- it helps --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it helps with doing exercises.  But, um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] I really feel bad that I couldn't join that -- that, ... um, gymnasium because they have -- the had all kinds of, [SIGH] you know, um, they had -- [NOISE] they have ... all kinds of things for all kinds of people, ... you know?  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Right.  You might --
R:  A- and --
L:  -- you might check --
R:  -- for people who are injured o- or -- you know like me or --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or, you know, people who are advanced, they have things and swimming pools and [SIGH] -- and, ah, -- and the teachers are really -- they're really nice they -- they're really nice to me there, [SIGH] you know.
L:  Right.
R:  So, ...  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Well, you might check and see if there's a YMCA close to --
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah, --
L:  -- you and they're --
R:  -- that'd be good.  [SIGH]  Yeah.
L:  -- and that probably --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- they have annual -- w- well memberships that you can --
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- [SIGH] ah, and sometimes they have s- specials on their membership --
R:  Oh, really?  [SIGH]
L:  -- where you d- don't have to pay --
R:  [SIGH]  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, ah, special fee and just so much per month.
R:  [SIGH]  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH]  But that's probably a lot cheaper than a --
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- than a regular gym.
R:  [SIGH]  You're right I probably should investigate that.  That's true, you know, --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- that would be a good thing because, you know, when it comes to exercise I -- I find it so boring, [SIGH] you know, just, ah, -- like to -- to even [MN] do leg lifts or a- [LAUGH] anything, I find it so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- boring that -- that I just, [SIGH] you know, would rather not face it and rather not [NOISE] do it but, you know, [SIGH] I know it's -- I know it's -- it's good for me to do it [NOISE] and I should do it, but I don't.  So, that's where -- I don't know, I -- I -- there's a +dilemma there.  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, I had a treadmill --
R:  Oh, you do?  [SIGH]
L:  -- where I used to try to walk -- well I --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I did have a treadmill [SIGH] I gave --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- it to my granddaughter.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH]  So, ...  [LIPSMACK]
R:  And does she use it?
L:  S- she's, ah, -- I'm not sure how much she uses it.  She's more over weight than I am.
R:  Oh, no.  [SIGH]  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  But ...  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Y -- Yeah, 'cause I'm over weight to an- an- and it -- [SIGH] well it's -- it's harder for --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think it's harder ... f- for over weight people to get [NOISE] into a regimen of things like that, you know, [SIGH] 'cause like the ... skinny people they can do any, -- you know.
L:  [SIGH]  Right.
R:  They really don't have to think about their weight, you know, and what they eat but we do and [SIGH] -- and, um, it's kind of hard --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to get, -- you know, get started, I think.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Well, the biggest --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- thing [SIGH] --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- that causes me to ... a- ah, keep from losing weight, I guess, is I -- I --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- l- like to eat too much.  [MN]
R:  Oh, no.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We all like --
L:  I just finished --
R:  -- to eat.  [SIGH]
L:  -- a bowl of ice cream which I --
R:  Oh, n- [LAUGH] no.
L:  -- should not have had.  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Oh, n- n- no.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, [LAUGH] that's a --
R:  [SIGH]  Well, you know, I think for -- for some people, [SIGH] [MN] y- you know, like, [MN] um, ... if you're happy with your weight a- and ... you don't have any problems with it then, [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- you know, I think that -- you know i- it -- if you get moderate exercise it's okay, you know.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  I mean, you know, --
L:  -- it's --
R:  -- you -- you don't have to look like -- like [NOISE] -- like we've been -- we've been bombarded [SIGH] with all these pictures.  With skinny women and, --
L:  Oh, well I --
R:  -- you know, like in -- in commercials and, [SIGH] you know, they're all t- thin and, y- you know, bony and everything --
L:  I agree with that --
R:  -- and we've been --
L:  -- and that --
R:  -- bombarded with that kind of advertisement so long [SIGH] that --
L:  [LIPSMACK]  That's not the average person but --
R:  Yeah, and that's not the -- that's n- --
L:  -- but we need --
R:  -- not reality.  [SIGH]
L:  -- we need t- to do enough --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- exercise to be healthy.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  I know that it's --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- it -- I need to exercise --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for my heart's sake.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  And as well --
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- as [NOISE] to ... try to lose weight and --
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- keep from gaining more weight.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Well --
L:  [SIGH]  Well, what about other --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- o- other types of, u- um, --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- h- health maintenance?  What -- do you take, ah, supplements --
R:  Yeah, I take --
L:  -- herbal --
R:  -- vitamins.  Well, see I have -- I -- I --
L:  -- or herbal supplements?
R:  Yeah, I -- I take, um, [SIGH] -- well I have this one -- I've bought this one can of ... supplement.  Um, I forget the name of i- it, but it's called Calcitones[?] or something like that [SIGH] and it has all these different vitamins  and it's like a -- it's like, ah, -- it's like, um, Slim fast, you know, [NOISE] like, they have all the vitamins and everything?
L:  Right.  Uh-huh.
R:  [SIGH]  But I make shakes and things like that.  [NOISE]  Um, -- you know, fruit shakes?  [SIGH]  And those are really good.  I'm beginning to like those a lot.  [SIGH]  Instead -- a- a- a- ah, and I'm kind of slowly converting [SIGH] u- um, because I'm a vegetarian also ... and I don't eat meat.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, [SIGH] I have -- I need those vitamins and I need, like, um, -- [NOISE] 'cause I'm anemic too.  I need vit- -- I need I- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a l- lot of iron.
L:  Right, you need to --
R:  [SIGH]  So, I eat a lot of beans and t- things like that --
L:  -- you need to eat beans to get protein.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, you need protein.  Yeah, that's what the doctor told me.
L:  So, --
R:  Because I was feeling really dizzy [SIGH] and I went to the doctor and they said I was anemic and I need ... t- to get, you know, protein but -- so she --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- gave me the iron and [SIGH] said eat beans and -- and things like that.  So, [SIGH] -- so --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- I'm doing that.  But, um, i- it's kind of funny because some days, ah, I don't know ever since I started being a vegetarian I -- I look, you know, 'cause I used to eat Big Macs and, [SIGH] you know, go to McDonalds a- and [LAUGH] an- an- -- [SIGH] and eat all, you know, l- like eat everything I could, you know, the french fries and all that but now [SIGH] it's kind of like, I don't know why, ... y- you know, since I started [NOISE] eating f- fruits and things like that --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- the -- the desire's m- minimized [SIGH] for those kind of things, y- you know.  [SIGH]  I still love ice cream like you do.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  That's the one thing I can't give [NOISE] up, ice cream and cereal in the mornings.  Those are the two things I can't give up.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  But, um, [MN] other than that it seems like --
L:  Well, you know, as  --
R:  -- you know, t- that [SIGH] --
L:  -- a vegetarian you don't have a problem.
