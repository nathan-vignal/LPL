L:  Hello, my name is Jennifer.
R:  Hi, my name is Mary.
L:  [SIGH] Mary, we're supposed to talk about health and fitness. [SIGH] Um did you hear the question we were asked?
R:  Yes.
L:  Do each of you exercise? [LAUGH] Oh, that's a terrible question.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Talk about bad timing. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yes.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Every day I tell my self I'm going to. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yes, me too. 
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] I'm forty seven years old, I'll be forty eight next month --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] and I have really noticed a decline in my -- [SIGH] in my -- the p- appearance of my body in the past couple of years --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] since I don't exercise regularly.
R:  Yeah, I just turned fifty in May.
L:  Oh, I see. [SIGH] I have a -- I have a fulltime job at a local hospital [SIGH] and I -- I use that as my excuse [SIGH] not to get -- not to get out and go to the [MN] Y.  we have a local Y.M.C.A.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] Um, I call walking my dogs exercise, but that's --
R:  Well, that is.
L:  -- [SIGH] it's -- it's a little bit of exercise I guess, but -- but, uh, [SIGH] you know, they kind of just wander around and sniff everything and I'm kind of wandering around behind 'em [SIGH] and I was just telling my husband how badly I knew -- I knew I needed to get back to the Y, [SIGH] because it would help me cope better with stress and [LIPSMACK] sleep --
R:  What --
L:  -- better at night, and.
R:  -- what kind of exercises do you do there?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, [SIGH] I -- they have a water aerobics class that I really enjoy [NOISE] because it doesn't s- 'cause you don't get all sweaty.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] And, uh, [SIGH] they also have a weight room that has machines that are computerized that are programmed to your strength [SIGH] and so they're real easy to work on but the computer's keeping track of your -- [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] your progress. [LIPSMACK] so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's kind of fun. [SIGH] And then I also walk on this -- on the treadmill. 
R:  Mm.
L:  [SIGH] And -- and [SIGH] one -- another big motivator for me is that my employer pays for the Y.M.C.A. membership [SIGH] so --
R:  Oh, that's great.
L:  -- yeah, so I have no excuse [SIGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- not to [LAUGH] -- not to show up; there and do what I know I need to do.
R:  [SIGH] Well, I've probably bought everything that's been on TV and I'll use it for a week or two and then that's --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  -- the last of it.
L:  Yeah, you know, I bought a treadmill once, I was just sure -- [SIGH] I lived out in the country and I was just sure it was going to keep me -- [NOISE] [SIGH] it was going to keep me from, uh, [NOISE] getting flabby.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I was just sure I would use it, I -- [SIGH] I said I'll turn it on when the news is on and [SIGH] before I know it I will have walked thirty minutes --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] and I just talked myself right out of using that.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Like you said I --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I made up excuses, "Oh, it's too loud, it -- [SIGH] it's too boring".  You know, and like -- like you did, I bought pieces of equipment and then they ended up becoming hangers for my clothes. [SIGH] 
R:  Well, have you always been --
L:  You know.
R:  -- into exercise, though, or --
L:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] Um --
R:  -- health and fitness?
L:  You know, I was never -- I was always the last kid picked at school for -- [MN] [NOISE] for athletics --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so I was unfamiliar with exercise even while I was a child.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] And I got it pl- I got some exercise just playing [SIGH] but, uh, after high school, and after I had a child, [SIGH] I got more motivated and I began going to a [SIGH] gym and walking a couple of times a week and [SIGH] I even tried running [SIGH] with my husband, but that lasted only as long -- until I got injured, and then I said, "Oh, there has to be an easier way". [SIGH] 
R:  And how did you get injured?
L:  Um, trying to run, try -- [SIGH] I don't know if you remember the big running craze in the mid seventies --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] and early eighties, but everybody was doing it and -- [SIGH] and, uh, [LIPSMACK] I got excited and said I could do it to, so I -- I didn't approach it the right way.  I just went into it full bore and [SIGH] did too much too soon and injured my knee. [SIGH] 
R:  Mm.
L:  So 
R:  Well, my husband likes to walk and that's basically, uh, [NOISE] the extent of my exercise.  Occasionally --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'll put in a -- [SIGH] a Richard Simmons tape and, uh, try to dance along with him.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yes, I've -- I've done that too, I -- remember when Jane Fonda was big --
R:  Mhm. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [SIGH] um, and I had Jane Fonda videos [SIGH] and every afternoon I would [NOISE] spend an hour, uh, with [NOISE] Jane Fonda [NOISE] and then, uh, there -- jazzercise, they also had a video.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] And I tried the jazzercise video.  So, like you, I -- I tried solo exercise, but it's very hard [SIGH] to stay motivated.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Does your husband walk with you?
R:  Uh, we don't walk a lot any more, but [SIGH] he likes to --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Uh-huh.
R:  -- but, uh, I'll -- I'll usually have an excuse not to go.
L:  Okay, so it's -- [SIGH] so, you're the one kinda holding back, or maybe he's just dropped it and --
R:  Well, I want to and I know I need to and then, uh, you know, we'll do it as four or five days in a row and I'll feel real good and then all of a sudden, I don't know why, I don't want to go. [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh. [SIGH] My problem has been [SIGH] I go -- I'm all enthusiastic and then that enthusiasm wanes. [SIGH] Rather than approach it -- approaching it slowly and at -- at my own pace [SIGH] I'll set goals for myself that I can't hope to meet --
R:  Right. 
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] so I -- I sabotage my -- [SIGH] my fitness. [SIGH] 
R:  And I think at our age, though, exercise is what we're going to have to do, though, in order to --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- lose weight and to --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- stay healthy.
L:  I just had a doctor's appointment yesterday and I knew that I'd gained [SIGH] since the last time I'd visited him, I'd -- I had gained at least -- [SIGH] at least fifteen pounds --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- [SIGH] and it's so much easier to do that than -- [SIGH] than it used to be.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know. [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] Well, I went on that Dr. Atkins diet several months ago and I stayed on it for probably five weeks --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I only lost five pounds and I got real aggravated and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and my husband said, "Well, if you look at how many pounds that is, that's a lot of fat".
L:  Probably a lot of pounds off your total.
R:  Yeah, and I don't have a lot of flab, my skin's, like, real hard.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- and --
L:  Your skin is firm.
R:  -- and I'm sure -- and it's mostly around the -- the middle.
L:  [NOISE] It's a lot harder for people who aren't very tall, because that's a larger percentage of your weight.
R:  Yeah, and --
L:  [SIGH] And --
R:  -- and I'm only five foot tall.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um -- but anyway --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- I could really feel my fat shrinking --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- from within my stomach, you know --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and I just felt so good. [NOISE] 
L:  it makes a big difference, but we use the wrong measuring tools to notice it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, we look at the scale and if the scale doesn't say what we think it should say we get discouraged.
R:  Exactly, when we should be looking at inches, you know, instead --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- of weight.
L:  How your clothes fit and how you feel.
R:  Mhm, [SIGH] and, uh --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- I stayed on that for about five weeks and, uh, I -- I had hoped to lose more weight than that, and then my grandkids came and stayed with me two weeks and, uh, I started eating all their junk food and -- [SIGH] so, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It doesn't take much.
R:  [LAUGH] No. [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, sometimes w- I'll get -- I work and my husband stays home and I'll come home and say, [SIGH] "What did you get me from the grocery store?" [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] "Where's the good food?". [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, he's got it --
L:  [SIGH] You know.
R:  -- made, don't he? [LAUGH] 
L:  He does have it made.  He's -- he does everything the homemaker would do and he does it so much better --
R:  Oh, well, that's great.
L:  -- [SIGH] and -- and he enjoys it, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] I'm happy to go to work and he takes care of everything else. [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah, I would like that too, I've always --
L:  But --
R:  -- like working and I'd like to --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- have a house husband.
L:  Yes.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And especially one who doesn't complain, and folds your underwear. [SIGH] 
R:  Oh, how sweet.
L:  I -- I know we're off [LAUGH] the topic, but [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] How sweet.
L:  -- [SIGH] but it's nice to have a partner --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, uh --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] I've been -- I've been --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- talking with my partner, my husband, about coming to the Y with me [SIGH] and meeting --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- me there after work [SIGH] and he has the same preconceived notions I do.  He'll say, [SIGH] "Well, it jut makes me so hungry, I can't -- [SIGH] I can't stand it, I just eat that much more and then I don't --"
R:  Oh.
L:  "-- lose weight". [SIGH] And like you said, maybe we're looking at the wrong indicators.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, and we need to just go for going's sake.  Like you said, we're getting to the age where we're going to have to do something --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] and we'd better --
R:  We need --
L:  -- decide what that is.
R:  We need to break these old habits and get into --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yes.
R:  -- some good ones. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, some new ones and stick --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- with 'em and [SIGH] I guess make a -- make a covenant that we're going to stick with 'em for [SIGH] X amount of time and then we'll reevaluate, do we need more, do we need less.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] And maybe not be so hard on ourselves.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Do you --
L:  [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] I know that I -- I give up very easily.
R:  I do too. [SIGH] Do you take a lot of, uh, vitamins?
L:  [SIGH] I do, I take a vitamin every day.  I used to -- I used to have all kinds of little bottles lined up, now I just take one --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] a multivitamin.  I throw in some extra things for women -- women our age, [SIGH] you know, and try to do that.  In fact, I've always done that since I was in my twenties.
R:  Yeah, mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] I thought it -- I thought it helped to keep me from getting sick.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] [SIGH] I -- I take vitamins every day, too --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean, at least that's one thing we can -- 
L:  we can do.
R:  -- yeah, to help, uh, our bones and stuff.
L:  Yes, and I h- I'm just getting to where I need to watch about [SIGH] drinking too much carbonated beverages because I know that causes bone loss and [SIGH] you know, doing [SIGH] a weight bearing exercise like walking [SIGH] or -- or lifting weights or, [SIGH] you know, anything that puts pressure on your bones to -- [SIGH] that helps build them up apparently or -- [SIGH] or at least prevent the loss that we're experiencing. [SIGH] 'Cause it's something that you can't see, you think you're doing everything right [SIGH] and then the doctor tells you, "Oh, you have -- [SIGH] you have experienced bone loss and you need to start working on that.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, you see --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um --
R:  -- people with that osteoporosis too, and I'm --
L:  Yes, you know --
R:  -- I'm --
L:  -- we see those little old ladies that we don't want to look like.
R:  No.  Oh, it's pitiful.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] But I never did learn how to swim, and I always thought that that was -- would be such a great, um --
L:  [LIPSMACK] It's such --
R:  -- activity.
L:  -- it's such a pleasurable exercise.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I hope you'll give it a try [SIGH] be-
R:  [SIGH] Well, my cousin says she's going to teach me how if --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I ever get there to get in her pool.
L:  [LIPSMACK] And, you know, many women at my -- [MN] at the -- my Y.M.C.A. do not know how to swim.
