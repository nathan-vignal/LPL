L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  I'm Kim.

R:  Yes.
L:  Kim, I'm Howard.
R:  Hi.  How are you?
L:  Good.  How are you?
R:  Pretty good thanks.
L:  Good.  Good.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  So, I guess we have to talk about exercise.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Uh, do you --
R:  Do you --
L:  -- exercise regularly?
R:  Actually I do.  I do.  Um, I go to a womens gym.  It's like, uh, Curves.  I don't know if they have 'em there but --
L:  N- -- where are you calling from?
R:  Um, I'm in Michigan but I'm actually from South Carolina.
L:  Oh, okay.  'Cause --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm from New York.
R:  Oh, I can tell.  I was gonna --
L:  [MN] Could you, from the short [LAUGH] --
R:  --ask, "Are you from New York?" [LAUGH]
L:  From that short [SIGH] -- short  few words?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Well, my --
L:  Well, goodness.  Oh, God.
R:  My husband's from New York so [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I kn- -- I know that then[?] but --
L:  Oh, God.
R:  Yeah, so do you work out?
L:  Yeah, yeah, I go --
R:  You --
L:  -- to the gym and I do.  I -- I do a little running and, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] tennis.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, that's basically[?], you know.
R:  So, what got your started working out?  Just --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, I mean, I was always, you know, since I was a kid I was, uh, you know, involved in sports --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and all but when you get a little older it's [LAUGH], you know, and I mean the -- the, uh, you know, uh, until recently -- like I'm -- I'm forty seven   Until recently I was actually playing softball but even that became too much.  So, you had -- I had to look for something I could do individually.
R:  Right, right.
L:  You know and not -- not as part of a team.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, um, you know, instead of going to the gym more often, um   There's a chain of gyms here called N- New York Sports Clubs.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, so you know doing that then I've -- I've always, you know, I've played tennis for a long time so that's the only really, you know, I guess participant sport --
R:  Right.
L:  -- if you don't consider, um, the gym.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And how about you?  I mean, how would --
R:  Well, you know, when I was, uh -- I'm only twenty five so I'm --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- still fairly young.
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  But, um --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I played ball all through school.  I was -- played softball and then --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I got married at twenty and I have three kids now so I kinda --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- got out of working out and my kids are a workout in themselves.
L:  I'm sure.  I can imagine.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] But, um, [LIPSMACK] then I have a, um -- was having some health problems and, um, my doctor suggested, you know, just going a few days a week to the gym and it's really -- my blood pressure went down and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I have a, um, [LIPSMACK] slight heart condition and so that I just go to, you know, keep -- keep things --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- good and to maintain where I'm at so --
L:  Sure, sure.
R:  I -- I try and go three to four times a week.
L:  Okay.
R:  Some days with the kids I'm not able to.  But --
L:  Mhm, mhm.  So, why --
R:  Like, yeah, that's why I -- I started going for; to get in the habit young 'cause I'm only twenty five and if I --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  If I don't when I'm young then it's -- it's --
L:  Becomes more difficult.  Yeah.
R:  -- much harder when you get older.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I -- I can vouch for that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, I mean, I try -- you know, the problem with me is, um -- and now I go mostly I'd say in my lunch hour from work.
R:  Right.
L:  Bec- -- I used to always do it after work but it's also -- I used to go actually after work to, um, a spin class.  I don't know if you're familiar with spin class?
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  So, I would do spin class, um, but, um, it come -- it came to the point 'cause like the gym where I go at lunchtime doesn't have spin.  So, I would go in the evenings after work to another gym --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But then you know it's come to the point that I would get home and, you know, prepare to go to the gym and just as I got home I'd say, "You know, uh, I don't feel like --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- going today".
R:  Yeah, yeah.  That's what I struggle with because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't work.  I'm a stay at home mom --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- so I have to wait 'cause the gym I go to doesn't have child care.
L:  Mhm.  Oh.
R:  So, I have to wait until my husband gets home but [NOISE] the way his hours are he's, you know, works one job and then he's a volunteer fire fighter so if a call goes out then --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's -- you know, I'm ready and then a call goes out so I'm like, "Whatever [LAUGH] --"
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's not worth going tonight".  So --"
L:  [LAUGH] Sure.
R:  But I do --
L:  But that --
R:  If I'm -- if I know I'm not gonna be able to go, you know, I'll load the kids up and we'll go walk the mall.  So --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  I -- I do try and at least stay active some way.  But --
L:  Mm.  Well, I try also, you know, either cycling or walking most days to work.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, that's great.
L:  And it's about -- it's about two miles each way.
R:  Oh, wow.  That's great.
L:  So -- so that's -- you know, that's -- well, it's one way to save on the subways. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  It's only a few bucks here and there but it --
R:  That's so bizarre to me that you can walk places 'cause it's, you know, twenty minutes in the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- car for me to get anyway 'cause we're in the country.
L:  Oh, oh.
R:  That's so wild.
L:  Well, you know, I have a house in the, um, in the Poconos in Pennsylvania.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  A weekend house.  Um, and when I first bought it, uh, I remember asking someone -- one of my neighbors, where the nearest home depot was and they said, you know, they gave me the name of a town and I said, "My God, that's far".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They said, "Oh, it's only forty five miles".
R:  [LAUGH] That's us.
L:  And --
R:  We drive twenty five miles to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Walmart.  Yeah.
L:  And here it's like, you know, you know, in New York to go two, three miles --
R:  Yeah.
L:  "Oh, my God".  And there it's forty five miles.  "Oh, it's nothing.  It's only forty five miles".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I know when my, um, inlaws ca- came up to visit not long ago and we were gonna take 'em out to dinner and we get on the expressway and we're driving and then a few minutes later my father in law said, "Where are you taking us?"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And it was, you know, thirty minutes to get to a restaurant and --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  We had to tell him, "You drive everywhere here".
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  But -- and it's not traffic it just takes that long.
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
R:  But --
L:  You know, it's funny 'cause when I drive I usually go Friday night to this house in the Poconos and it's about   It takes maybe two hours.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I would say half a -- half a -- half an hour; so about twenty five percent of that time is just getting like through the Holland Tunnel out of Manhattan.
R:  Uh-huh.  Wow.
L:  You know, just -- just leaving where I am at.
R:  Wow.
L:  You know, and then I cross over into New Jersey and then New Jersey -- straight through New Jersey into Pennsylvania it's no problem.  
R:  Right.
L:  It's -- you know, it's eighty miles but it's moving.  But it takes twenty five percent of the time just to get out of [LAUGH] -- through that tunnel.
R:  Oh, I couldn't do that. [LAUGH]
L:  So, it's, yeah.  It's a completely different world.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  You know.  But, um, but yeah, so, you know, going -- I mean, going back to the gym it's just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Going at -- at lunchtime it gives me   I -- I'm a little more disciplined --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- at that time.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  Um, yeah, you know, you're not as leisurely because you're rushing.  You have to get back to work and all.
R:  Right, right.
L:  But, um, but it's -- there are some days that I go, "Oh, I'm tired.  I don't feel like going and then I go and then I feel completely revived.  It just -- it -- it -- it makes me feel so good afterwards.
R:  Yeah.  That was me.  Is when I started and with the place I go to is it's a all women's gym and it's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- focused to be in and out.  It's a thirty minute circuit kind of thing --
L:  Oh, sure, yeah.
R:  -- where you do a circuit.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And at first I thought, "No way can you get a work out in thirty minutes that --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, will do anything".  And I was amazed.  But my energy level with the kids went, I mean, just sky rocketed and --"
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I struggle with, um, [NOISE] I have a [NOISE] thyroid problem where I'm --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- exhausted all the time and --
L:  Oh.
R:  I'm just really tired.  But working out my --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- energy level just shot up.
L:  Yeah. [inaudible]
R:  And you know I didn't start going to lose weight or anything like that 'cause I didn't -- you know, I was at a fine [NOISE] weight.  I just --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- wanted to go for, you know, the energy and -- and I thought, "How can working out make me have more energy?"  But it's just --
L:  Yeah, you would think just like how you said.  You'd think you'd -- you think you'd be exhausted or something.
R:  Right, right and --
L:  Oh, sure.
R:  It just -- it really boosted my energy level with the kids.  Now I can -- you know, and we have a trampoline that they wanna be on --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- twenty four seven and before there was no way I could --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- jump on that with them for any amount of time and now they're in the summer 'cause it snows so much here we've --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- been out there every day so far and you know in the pool and on the trampoline and I can keep up with them now.  So --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  But it's --
L:  Yeah, I mean, that's not -- but, you know, I try to think if I n- -- if I get into that feeling of "Uh, I don't feel like going tonight", I just think how good I'm going to feel afterwards.
R:  Right, right.
L:  And that gives me that little push that I need --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- to really get out and go.
R:  Yeah, and my husband's good about, "No, go 'cause if you don't you'll beat yourself up the rest of the night".
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  'Cause you don't go and -- which he's right 'cause if I don't go then I beat myself up about it and --
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  But if I do, you know, I'm home within the next hour and I feel great.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  But --
L:  So, I mean, you have to -- so he -- he takes care of the kids when you go or --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  Yeah, rather begrudgingly some days but --
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  He can handle 'em for an hour.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Oh, that, yeah.  But I mean, also it's -- and for some people it's become the whole social thing.  
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I wanna go in and out.  I wanna get in and out as fast as -- do my thing.  I enjoy --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it but I wanna get out.  I mean, there are -- there are people who just, particularly in the evenings, linger and make a whole --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- social thing out of it.
R:  Yeah.  I've -- I notice that too.  A lot of the women at mine -- of course so many of us are moms who --
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's all we do is -- that's our one out and they ju- -- I mean, they're like hens in a hen house.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They're, you know, talking about everybody and everything and --
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  But it is and --
L:  Well, some here have, you know, they'll have a -- a little like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  A -- a -- a juice bar.  This is where I'm thinking [inaudible].
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Juice bar so people go in there and they [inaudible] and have their juice and it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- becomes a -- like I said before your whole social thing.  And it's 'cause you m- --
R:  Yeah, it has -- gyms have all of a sudden turned into a trendy thing which --
L:  Mhm, mhm
R:  -- is great.  It's -- 'cause --
L:  Oh, sure.
R:  -- Americans need the exercise.  
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
R:  I mean, look at the people out there.  We really need to get off our duffs and --
L:  As a matter of fact there was a -- there was an article in the New York Times this morning about students in a New York City public school and they said I think twenty five percent or a third or something like that, of all the students are considered overweight or obese.
R:  That ama- -- well, 'cause they --
L:  Which is a -- which is a f- --
R:  They sit in front of the TV with their [inaudible] or whatever they --
L:  Right.  Or they're just in front of the computers or whatever.
R:  Right, right.
L:  But, you know, and then stuffing their face with garbage and not moving.
R:  Yep, yep.  And that's why w- -- I mean, I will not let -- and so many -- my kids are three, two and one.  I mean, they're little.
L: Oh.  Oh, yeah.
R:  And I have friends whose kids are the same age that have TVs in their rooms and their kids are allowed to watch movies in their rooms and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's TV, TV, TV and already Nintendo at three and my --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- kids; no TV in their rooms.  None of that.
L:  No good [inaudible].  Yeah, I think it's -- 
R:  And --
L:  Think it's like, you know, it's a -- it's a babysitter.
R:  It is.
L:  That, you know.
R:  It is and we -- I mean, the TV there that's n- -- they're not allowed that.  No TV in the car like all these TVs in cars now. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  We don't do that and in the morning soon as they have breakfast it's outside and we
