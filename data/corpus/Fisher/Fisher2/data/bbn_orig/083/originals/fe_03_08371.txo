L:  Hi, this is Dave.
R:  Hi, Dave, this is Julie.
L:  How are you doing?
R:  I'm doing okay.
L:  All right, um, well do you exercise regularly?
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I walk every day.  Um, I don't, like, go to -- go to the gym every day any more, I did that for a while, you know, a few days a week --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and found that it is more stressful to get there, stand in line, deal with the noise --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and so --
L:  I understand.
R:  -- yeah.
L:  Yeah, um, during the summer I do not regular -- uh, exercise regularly, it's pretty sporadic, it just depends on when it happens.  Um, I live where it's pretty hot in the summer so pretty much everything outside is just a bad decision.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, uh, during the -- the -- the school year I try to exercise on a somewhat regular basis.  It kind of fluctuates depending on if it's exam time or whatever, but I definitely try to exercise a couple of times every week just to stay in the habit.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] Yeah, I've noticed a real change, um, I need to [LAUGH] work out more.  I mean, when I was naturally -- you know, when I was a student and that kind of thing and involved in organized sports and cheerleading and all --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that stuff, I was really in great shape, it felt terrific.  Um, it didn't take, you know, five or six years [LAUGH] out of being in that extra activity thing to notice a difference, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I need to find something that's more active on a regular basis and also what I'm -- um, add some lifting weights, that kind of stuff, resistance exercise, for building bone density as I get a- -- older.
L:  That's good stuff --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- good stuff.  Yeah, I definitely, uh -- in high school I was a very competitive athlete and now that I don't have a coach pushing me every day after school and stuff, I definitely notice that my work outs are fewer and far between --
R:  [LAUGH] Yes.
L:  -- and they definitely end a lot quicker, there's not as much push to, uh -- to always push until it hurts or work it until I can't do any more.  I just kind of do it until I'm -- I feel pretty much like I've gotten my heart rate up and I'm still feeling fine.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, uh --
R:  Yeah, I can still -- you know, since I walked in fast +bursts -- bursts often every day -- run -- I run for the bus, run home from the bus, all that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, I find that I can, you know, walk twenty or thirty blocks e- -- uh, even much of it uphill and be -- not -- not get out of breath and be pretty comfortable and not all that heated up.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, but I ca- can't normally do it with somebody else, people are used to driving places --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I use the bus, um, by choice and I ride bikes and that kind of stuff, now and then,  not often enough.  I find that a lot of people who, if we're just going to walk across down town to get to another club -- nightclub or something like that, people go, like, four blocks and they start complaining.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  And they just -- it -- I think so many people are so out of shape, if they can't go four blocks without feeling winded or complaining about how long is it, "Is it over ten blocks?"  It's just -- it stuns me, uh, so -- but by the same token I'm not doing my own goals.  I mean, riding bikes a few times a week should be in there just for my regular routine, but it's not --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so ...
L:  Yeah, I definitely notice that, uh during the week I will, uh, ride the bus to school and while I'm there I'll -- I'll walk from one side of campus to the other just to handle a simple chore or something.  When the weekend rolls around I've got access to my car, I'm so happy to drive it the shortest distance, I -- I -- it's -- it's -- it's a bad habit but I realize most of my friends are even worse.  Um, I live with, like, five friends right now during the summer and two of us will go ride bikes or we'll go for a row and -- and we'll ask the others and one of them will go occasionally, but the other two just laugh in pure amusement --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that we're going to get up intentionally just to go --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and get sweaty and come back and they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just -- there're others -- there's a lot of my friends -- my friends pretty much fall into those two --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- groups.  They will work out --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- any time --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- somebody wants to or simply scoff at the idea of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- walking to the store when they could drive.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I think that's amazing.  I usually haul five or six bags back and it's, uh -- it's more than ten or twelve blocks --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, I real- -- I even have to stop and rest now and then, but it's -- it's a good weight lifting exercise --
L:  Oh definitely.
R:  -- you know, and even if you just take the laundry, you just take your time, the more weight lifting you're doing --
L:  Right.
R:  So, for me -- and that -- but that again that's only, like, once or twice a month, so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [NOISE] um, so it's still not enough to be, um, consistent enough.
L:  Right.
R:  I -- but I like digging in the garden and I try to do all my own hauling of stuff and that kind of thing instead of asking guys to do it all the time.  I've always been vigorous and, um, I think that makes a big difference.
L:  Yeah, definitely,
R:  But, it's not consistent and, um, [LAUGH] you know -- and it doesn't always push your limit.
L:  Yeah.  I definitely -- I'm still trying to work on getting something that's on a regular basis, I think that I've found that without some type of sports team where I constantly need to be in a consistent type of shape, whether it's peak shaped for one activity or another --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- without having that need I don't really desire to work out like the same type of work out on a really regular basis, in fact I think I find it more stressful --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- trying to fit it in on those days when it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it doesn't fit --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- simply because I haven't had my work out today or it's Wednesday and I'm supposed to go and do this, so I try to just make it kind of accidentally fit as often as possible --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and encourage all my friends that any time they're going to go to let me know, because if somebody else wants to go do something for fun that is exercise, I'll go and I'll enjoy it.  But, I -- I notice that I've tried, once I got to school during the summers, during the year, to try to get some kind of routine going and I realize it's not me, so I've got to find some kind of other option, some kind of --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- either a job that just gets me more physically active --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or -- or just a group of people who like to exercise on a regular basis and playing racquetball is one and going biking was another --
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah, but --
L:  -- because -- get another person definitely is a great motivator.
R:  Yeah, using those lifelong sports, tennis and racquetball, all that kind of stuff --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- don't worry [NOISE] a buddy will call you if you don't call them, that's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um -- that's a really great way to go.
L:  Yeah.  I think also, uh, weighing myself on a regular basis is good, because as soon as I start feeling like I haven't exercised in a few days and if I happen to stop on the scales that day and see that it -- it looks like I haven't, it'll -- it'll get me thinking, like, I start trying to figure out -- what is it I can do today, who haven't I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- called in the last few days, who haven't I bumped into and I'll get me to do it.  I think some people don't find it very encouraging, but I think it's a good way -- that or -- or trying to keep a note of what you eat, 'cause I think sometimes when I don't exercise for a few days, I start sitting around --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I kind of become more of a couch potato, but if I think back --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  -- on how much I've eaten --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm, like, "Whoa, got to get out".
R:  Yeah, you mentioned the heat where you are -- we use --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in -- I'm in Oregon and we use the excuse for eight months out of the winter when it's raining --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that's our excuse for not getting out and getting more active or doing as much.  And then for me also, when it's darker I don't have as much energy --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but if you work out you have more energy. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  You get up and get moving [NOISE] you have more energy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And outdoors you get more light than indoors in the winter, even if it is raining, so, um --
L:  Right.  In North Carolina there's such a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- fluctuation 'cause in the summer, like today the heat advisory was a hundred and one so --
R:  Jeeze.
L:  -- with -- we get -- the East Coast is -- at least in North Carolina gets far higher humidity than anywhere else in the United States --
R:  Yeah, that's awful.
L:  -- so the humidity's eighty, ninety percent, but it's not raining it's just sticking to you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, then in the winter, mostly we're used to being warm and in the winter when it starts snowing and getting ice on the ground, we don't have that kind of equipment and it's kind of -- it's pretty expensive to go out and get good boots for walking in the snow or skis or something like that when they're only good for a month or two.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  So, we get our winter excuse and then we get a summer excuse and --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- it's like we're -- as soon as you get a good habit going the weather changes and we switch to something else and so, I think, during the summer and the winter I -- I try to find some other -- I don't know, something different to make up for the, uh -- the -- the switch in climate.  During the fall and spring, I don't have a problem, that's when I definitely do the most exercise and everything.  It -- it gets really nice outside and there's no good excuse to not do things.  So, everybody gets active, especially on campus when there's so many people -- 'cause I go to a big school, so there's lots --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- of people --
R:  Yeah, great.
L:  -- doing stuff.  But, during the -- the winter everybody gets quiet, it's almost exams then it's Christmas break.  Then we get back and it's the beginning of a new semester and it's even colder and then in the summer there's -- I'm so used to being around so many students during the year that in the summer when there's only a couple of people around and it's so hot --
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, you put --
L:  -- I definitely have a hard time.
R:  Yeah, you pretty much have to use one of the indoor gyms or whatever.
L:  Right.
R:  I assume there are air- air conditioned racquetball courts, that kind of stuff?
L:  Yeah, yeah, I've --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I've started bicycling with a friend of mine because the -- the exercise -- like, he likes to ride off road.  So, the exercise in that is more, like, trying to stay on and balance and using the strength to get up all the short hills and down hills.  So, it's not so hot and it's usually shaded and it's not like a constant endurance workout like running or playing soccer or something.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, it's -- it's good just to -- just to be doing something outside every day and trying to get a basketball or a racquetball or something indoors when I can, but it is a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- lot harder during the summer.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It looks like a small school in the summer so, I kind of have to -- have to work harder to make stuff like that happen.
R:  Yep, yeah, I find that when you make choices, I mean when you leave school you'll be making choices on where to live [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that kind of stuff, um, every time it's really worth it looking at what's your daily physical movement related to where you live --
L:  Right.
R:  -- how's this going to help me?  Not just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- save me some time, but help me live health -- more healthy and energetic.
L:  Right.
R:  So, that's, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I -- i -- uh -- uh -- I've been buying houses and I use -- since I use the bus I always make sure that my house is at least four or five blocks away usually, from the bus.  I'm a little closer now, so I'm getting naturally a -- a few blocks a day less exercise, right --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I notice --
