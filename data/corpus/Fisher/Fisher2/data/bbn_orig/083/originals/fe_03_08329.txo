R:  Rhonda.
L:  Angie.  Hi, Rhonda.
R:  Hi, Angie, how you doing?
L:  I'm fine.  How about you?  What are we discussing?
R:  Exercising.
L:  Oh.
R:  If you do exercise on a regular basis.
L:  No, I don't exercise on a regular basis.
R:  [MN] Neither do I.
L:  Nah, no.
R:  Although I think I need to.
L:  No, I don't, I just think it's a waste of time -- I mean, it's not a waste of time for those that do it but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for me I just don't have time.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I have three kids and that's enough exercise for me.
R:  Oh, how old are they?
L:  They're six, three and one.
R:  Oh, okay, yeah, so you do get a lot of exercise then.  Okay, my kids are a little older than yours --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they're thirteen -- no, fourteen and eleven.
L:  Do they exercise as teens?
R:  No, they don't exercise.
L:  No, see I don't --
R:  Actually though I did tell my daughter that I wanna have her start going walking with me.
L:  Oh, so you --
R:  So, um --
L:  So, see, you walk.
R:  No, I don't do anything --
L:  That's a little exercise --
R:  -- yet so that's --
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  -- something that I wanna do.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I have all the equipment I just don't ex- --
R:  Oh, you do?
L:  Yeah, we, uh, the exercise machines and, uh, wal- treadmills and the waist inches, I just don't use it.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  I just --
R:  I want to get me a treadmill.
L:  No, I don't --
R:  You know, at least if I'm, um, walking [NOISE] around -- you know, around the street or at the park or whatever --
L:  Right.
R:  -- at least I could do was, um, walk on a treadmill.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, and I can do that while I'm watching TV or whatever --
L:  Right.  Peo- people say that --
R:  -- you know.
L:  -- but I never -- I says it but I just -- I can't enjoy TV and walk.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.  Okay.
L:  But I like to stay focused and I just can't, then my little --
R:  Oh no, I could.
L:  See and the kids --
R:  I think.
L:  Mine are so little they try to get up on the treadmill and walk.
R:  Yeah, that's true.  Well, I'm sure you wo- you running in the park with them, walking --
L:  Right, see I do that outside.
R:  -- that, you know, taking walks with them and stuff so you were getting a lot of exercise.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  So, but, um, that's one of the things that I really wanna get into --
L:  Exercising.
R:  -- but -- but there's only twenty four hours in a day --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- you know, and [NOISE] by the time I finish work and then running around for the kids, playing taxi cab mom and stuff --
L:  Right, see I do that, I'm --
R:  -- you know, I don't really time to do a lot of walking and stuff.
L:  Right.  Well, I walk when school's in -- I got to school --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I go to university.
R:  Oh, do you?
L:  Right.
R:  Where you living?
L:  In Texas.
R:  Oh, okay, okay.
L:  Are you in Texas?
R:  No, I'm in New Jersey.
L:  Oh, okay, no.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We're in Texas.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, how nice.
L:  And I go to school and, uh, when I walk around that campus --
R:  Oh, girl, I know.
L:  -- that's more than enough.
R:  I know, that's right.
L:  Especially at my age.
R:  Uh, how old are you?
L:  I'm about to be thirty.
R:  You're about to be thirty?
L:  Yes.  
R:  Oh please, girl, I'm forty.
L:  Oh no, see but forty's good 'cause I just don't like thirties. [NOISE] I think between thirty and forty is just -- [LAUGH]
R:  Well, it's because, you know, you set certain goals for yourself --
L:  Mm, you're right.
R:  -- you know, and then you're like, "Okay, when I reach forty years -- I mean, thirty years old --"
L:  Right.
R:  -- you -- you -- you like to see some of those goals completed.
L:  Right.
R:  And when you see they're not then you get a little depressed --
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  -- you know, at thirty because that's like a mid point, you know.
L:  Right, and I had planned on losing weight by the time I'm thirty and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that ain't happened either.
R:  Oh well, you know --
L:  That was one of my goals. [LAUGH]
R:  -- walk -- what do they say, "Walk and drink water" right? [NOISE]
L:  That's -- that's what I hear, walk and drink water.
R:  Mhm, that's -- yeah, walk and drink lots of water and stuff, you know --
L:  I'll have to try it.
R:  -- um, [LIPSMACK] 'cause I -- I wanted to do some scrunches but I know those things don't work, cr- crunches.
L:  Cr- you don't think those --
R:  Yeah, mm.
L:  -- now I see, I think those work.
R:  I don't think they work.
L:  I think they work, um, now my husband, um, he runs like three or four miles a day.
R:  Oh, does he?
L:  Now, he's the fit one.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm not the fit one at all.
R:  Oh, get out, that is good.
L:  We're, like, totally opposite. [LAUGH]
R:  That's good though, you know --
L:  So --
R:  -- the fact that he does run a couple of miles a day.
L:  Right.
R:  That's really good.  So, um, I don't know, you should try it though, I mean, I know I ain't doing no jumping jacks and all that.
L:  Right [LAUGH].
R:  But, um, yeah, but I -- I think walking will probably really help.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, plus, you know, um, with -- diabetes runs in my family --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, so, um, exercising and walking's really good.
L:  Well, see I thought about that.  My mom just find out she has diabetes.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, does she?
L:  Just found out, like, a couple months ago.  No --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- yeah, that she has diabetes [NOISE].  And so she's been suggesting that I could do something to, um, [NOISE] something to prevent my chances --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- of getting diabetes.
R:  Yeah, because, you know, my -- my grandmother and grandfather and aunts and uncles and everybody has it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know what I'm saying?  So, um, we really should be doing something -- some type of exercise and stuff --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to -- to help prevent from getting it.  You know, because of course once you get it you know it's gonna lead to other problems and stuff too.
L:  That's true.
R:  You know?
L:  But see she's lost a lot of weight.
R:  Has she?  What --
L:  My mom was --
R:  -- what has she been doing?
L:  You know how they play some music on the radio at -- from, like, oldies for goldies and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- she listens to that and she just moves around the house real fast.
R:  Okay, so she's --
L:  She doesn't --
R:  -- sort of she exercises to that?
L:  Right, she exercises and she watches -- she eats a lot --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- she doesn't have like sugars or, uh --
R:  Okay, yeah, 'cause --
L:  She's laid off sweets, like, totally.
R:  Okay, yeah, she's doing real good 'cause by ma --
L:  She -- right, she's doing good.
R:  -- yeah, my mom she exercise.  Well, she walks, she goes to the mall -- um, to the park --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and she walks around, um, the track.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, um, and she always spend much time in the mall walking around too so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that's her exercise also.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, that's real good.
L:  I can't get into it.
R:  What, walking?
L:  No exercising -- [NOISE] she --
R:  Exercising.
L:  My mom -- just a couple of months ago she started out in a size eighteen --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- 'cause I'm an eighteen.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And she's a fourteen now.
R:  Oh, that's real good.
L:  I know 'cause she calls me, "I'm in a fourteen now, girl, I just bought some fourteen".  I says, "All right then.  All right".
R:  That is so nice.
L:  It is nice. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  That is really nice.  Wow.  So, how long you been doing this?
L:  The exercising or ...?
R:  No. [NOISE] The --

R:  [LAUGH]
L:  This is my first one.
R:  Oh, okay, yeah, mine too.
L:  [LIPSMACK] So, I really wanna -- 
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  -- take my name off now, I think.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  'Cause I'm not really that good at -- like, my husband's he's -- he's done it a couple time -- I haven't done it but -- and he talks like he's on it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Talking but I just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't know what to say, especially about fitness 'cause I'm not, uh, physical fit.  I'm twenty nine years old and I just -- I work in the yard, uh, runs behind my one year old and that's it.  And when school's in I walk around the campus [NOISE] that's about --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- as fit as I get.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And watching what I eat I just -- that's very -- I just don't eat a lot of -- [MN] I don't eat a lot of sweets.  I'm not a big sweet eater.
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
L:  Yeah, I can't -- now I make in -- for it in other areas but I just don't eat a lot of sweets so --
R:  Mhm. [LIPSMACK] Oh okay, well, you know what, [NOISE] just some little walk or you should run with your husband.
L:  On the treadmill.
R:  No, run with your husband.
L:  Outside, oh --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- girl, he'd been and left me.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And [LAUGH] I'd be out there all by myself.  And then I couldn't take my little -- my son.
R:  Oh, okay, yeah.
L:  See.  'Cause then I'd just be -- end up just walking.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, that is so good that your husband runs --
L:  Oh yeah, he's --
R:  -- like that, you know.
L:  -- a big -- yeah, he's a -- well, he's a police officer.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  His job.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  It doesn't require him to run --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- there's just a lot of fat ones out here.
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  But he just likes to be fit. [MN]
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, that's good.
L:  Somebody in the family is.
R:  Oh, I know that's right.
L:  'Cause I'm not.
R:  But, um, yes, so hopefully I -- I -- when I start walking 'cause I asked my daughter, she's fourteen, to walk with me, she was, like, [MN] "Yeah, I --" 
L:  At that age it's hard to get --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- out there and walk.  If they think that, uh, that nice body and it just last forever --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but it don't.
R:  Mhm.  It, uh, they do, she does.
L:  Yeah, I know how I thought 'cause I was in high school and I wore the nice -- the belly showing skirts and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when I got out of high school I think I was like a one forty or one fifty.
R:  Okay.
L:  And now it's just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I went from a size twelve to a ten to a eighteen.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.
L:  Within a year.
R:  Okay.  Mhm, and now it's like, you know -- we'd be like, "Well, I'm gonna get back down to that size" --
L:  Right.  Do you own --
R:  -- you know. 
L:  -- any fitness equipment?
R:  I don't, no.
L:  No, see that --
R:  That's what I was saying that, you know, I really want to get a treadmill.
L:  Right, well --
R:  You know, so at least I do a little bit of walking that way.
L:  -- you should get one at Sears. [NOISE] That's the best.
R:  At Sears.
L:  The Walmart ones if -- well, if you're just a walker then, I guess, the ones at Walmart, 'cause, you know, they sell 'em at Walmart now.
R:  Oh, do they?
L:  Like two hundred dollars.
R:  Oh, okay.  All right.
L:  So, if you're gonna, um -- if you're gonna run then I suggest you get one at -- at Sears.
R:  Oh, I ain't running nowhere.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [inaudible].
R:  I ain't running nowhere.
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  Huh?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I ain't running nowhere.  I -- I'm gonna walk.  I --
L:  Well, see the one at Walmart's fine -- I'm just -- that's what he said.  He says [NOISE] the ones at Walmart are just for running but -- I mean, for walking but the [NOISE] ...
