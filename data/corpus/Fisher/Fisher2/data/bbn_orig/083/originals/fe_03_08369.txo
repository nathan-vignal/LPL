L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, thi- uh, this -- I'm Heather.
R:  Hi, Heather, I'm Lisa, how are you?
L:  Good, how are you?
R:  I'm doing great.
L:  Where are you?
R:  I'm in Salt Lake City.
L:  You're in Salt Lake City, oh, I'm in Pennsylvania.
R:  Oh you're in Pennsylvan- --
L:  Oh no, I'm sorry, I'm in -- I'm in Atlanta, Georgia, [MN] from Pennsylvania originally. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, you're in -- oh, I'm from Ohio originally.
L:  Are you?
R:  Yeah, very nice.
L:  So, we're --
R:  Is it hot in Atlanta.
L:  Oh, miserably hot.
R:  I can't even imagine living there in the summer time.
L:  Oh, it is hot.  Well, how is Salt Lake is it nice or ...?
R:  You know, it's hot but it's a very dry heat and so it's not like --
L:  It doesn't feel sticky and heavy.
R:  Oh, it's nothing like what you have to go through there in Atlanta.
L:  Yeah, it gets pretty gross, although it's not as bad as Tampa. [LAUGH]
R:  That's probably true.  I think my worst misery with, uh, humid was in Florida at Disneyworld one year.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We flew out early, it as just too much.
L:  It does get that way.
R:  [MN]
L:  I do believe that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, our topic is health and fitness, if -- do we exercise?  Do you exercise? [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] You know what I used to and I just started getting back into it just in the past couple of weeks but I did.  Have you heard of Bill Phillips?
L:  What is it?
R:  It's called the Bill Phillips Body for Life program.
L:  The Bowflex?
R:  Bill Phillips.
L:  Oh, Bill Phillips, no I haven't heard of that.
R:  Yeah, it's called Body for Life and you work out six days a week and you eat equal amounts of protein and chicken or protein and, uh, I guess, uh, protein and carbs --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- six days a week and the seventh day you can do whatever you want.  But it's a really rigorous diet and exercise program and I did great on it until I got injured [NOISE] in the health spa, so ...
L:  Oh no.
R:  Yeah, that happened and so that was two years ago and I'm just now getting back into it and I had to start really slowly so I'm now doing water aerobics and thought about signing up for Weight Watchers today. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh really?  Well, I'm an Avon representative so I do -- I'm on this -- Avon has a Slimwell diet plan which I started --
R:  What's it called?
L:  Slimwell.
R:  Slimwell.
L:  It's the -- Slimwell, right, like Slimfast but Slimwell.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's through Avon.
R:  How does it work?
L:  Oh, it's -- it's -- it's -- you have -- there are pills to take, the don't have the ephedra, they don't have the caffeine in it they're just -- they're real good at helping control your appetite.  I take 'em half hour before I eat twice a day and I s- I use -- eat the bars, their shake -- you know, you can make shakes or bars or whatever.  And the bars are so yummy. [LAUGH]
R:  Really.
L:  It's -- and they're thick and they're less sugar than Slimfast and Pure Calorie.
R:  Really?  And how much does that cost?
L:  Uh, well, I think it's -- let's see in the catalogue it's fourteen ninety nine, uh, [NOISE] per cam- for -- for a fifteen day supply.
R:  [NOISE] And it -- and do you one or two --
L:  For the -- for the pills.  And then it was like twelve ninety nine for a box ten -- ten, um, [LIPSMACK] uh, ten bars.
R:  Okay, so it's about --
L:  But it's actually --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you know, it's -- it's not that bad.
R:  Wow, and that's from Avon?
L:  That's from Avon.
R:  I haven't heard -- does it work?
L:  Oh, it's been working wonders for me.  It really curbs my appetite and it really gives me the incentive to lose weight 'cause it tastes good.
R:  [NOISE] Wow.
L:  You know, I get the honey -- honey -- honey peanut bars and they are just so good and they're thick --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and heavy so it takes me a while to chew 'em. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's always nice.  How are long have you been on it?
L:  Oh, I've -- I've -- uh, this is like my fourth week and I'm just -- I'm doing really well.  I haven't -- I have [NOISE] stopped putting weight and --
R:  Well, that's --
L:  -- really started working out -- you know, working well with it but as far as exercising, you know, it -- I -- I do it because I can't exercise as much so I have diet.
R:  Is it because you don't have enough time?
L:  No time.
R:  No.
L:  Being I'm an Avon rep, full time, I'm a unit leader and then I've got three kids.
R:  Full time selling Avon?
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  I didn't know that was possible.
L:  It is wonderful.
R:  Really?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  How many people do you have below you?
L:  Uh, right now, uh, immediately I think I have ten, uh, in my first generation and five in my second, under them.  Well, actually about -- alm- you know, fifteen or sixteen.
R:  And you can do that full time?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Wow.
L:  Oh yeah, and you go into leadership so you get the residual income.
R:  [MN]
L:  And it was just written up in Business week and Clark Howard just did a big thing about how great the leadership program is with Avon.
R:  Oh, I love Clark Howard.
L:  Yeah, I do too.
R:  Oh, he's coming --
L:  He's based here in Atlanta so --
R:  Oh, that's right. [LAUGH] I get his newsletter.  I read it every once in a while, he's -- he's really --
L:  Yeah, he just did a good write up on us too.
R:  I'll have to look that up.  But do they have any- uh, thing else in their diet program, Avon?
L:  Um, uh, let me s- let me think.  They have lots of different -- different types of bars, different types of shakes and then they have a whole wellness line of equipment, uh, different types of products --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for, um, for, uh, like, Planet Spa, they have new line called Planet Spa, you know, nice -- nice, uh, aromatherapy, uh, like, uh, sell all kinds of different equipment as well.
R:  I have never heard of any that from Avon.
L:  Well, it's at Avon and it's the Wellness catalogue.
R:  [MN] Okay.
L:  Want me to give you my website you can check out.
R:  Yeah, hold on, let me -- well, actually just keep talking to me and I'll grab a pen and I'll take a look at it.
L:  But so, yeah, so as far as exercise, like, um, you know, they -- they -- you can get weights, you can get, uh, for your ankles or your wrists, you can get hot and cold packs which are great, which they're actually you -- they -- you put 'em on.  You can, uh, get -- keep yourself cool when you run, you just freeze 'em and you put 'em into your wrist -- wrist bands and then you run with them or walk with them and it keeps you cool.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  You know, 'cause it's on your vein and they have that in the newest Wellness one and that -- which I'm -- which I'm getting.
R:  Oh great.  Can I order a catalogue from your website?
L:  Oh yeah, you can go right on there and you can actually look through the entire catalogue.  If you want give me your address I'll be able to, uh, um, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, send them to you.
R:  If you could send me one of those catalogues I would love to see that.  I'm just starting to get back into and I was just thinking today that I needed to get some water aerobics, like, little weights and --

L:  If you ever wanna sell it, of course, I'm here. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you know, I don't ever see myself selling it but I love the Avon line.  I love -- I just, um, I have all kinds of different things from Avon.  I love their moisturizers and -- they just have a great product line --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that --
L:  Oh they are, they are, they're wonderful.  But, I guess --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we should we stay [LAUGH] --
R:  Back to health and wellness. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, but it's -- it's all worth all the health and wellness but as far as exercising --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I just don't have the time to -- you know, I -- if I ha- I really want a treadmill.
R:  Oh.
L:  Because then I could do it in the comfort of my home when it's raining -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when the kids are playing or napping.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, I -- I just don't have time to go out and walk around the block and have to deal with it.  And that's -- that's what I like to do, I love to walk.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  But I'm just not into it without -- you know, not being -- I'm not able to go out and have the time to leave the kids.  They're, uh, they're one, two and nine. [LAUGH] I'm not gonna go --
R:  I guess you're not going too far with those kids. [LAUGH]
L:  No, exactly.  So, when I'm pushing the stroller my two year old is almost three and he's too big for the stroller so that doesn't help me either.
R:  Aw.  I have a treadmill and I get completely bored on it.
L:  Do you?  See I never get bored --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- on a treadmill.
R:  Well, I can watch television, like, I'll watch the morning show.  I get so bored I just have a really hard time sticking with the treadmill.  I'd rather be outside biking or hiking or doing something else but the treadmill just gets really difficult [LAUGH].
L:  Really?  I love the treadmill, I just think it's so -- it's -- my endorphins kick in and I just go, go, go, go.
R:  How long can you run for?
L:  Oh, I don't run, I walk.
R:  You just walk on the treadmill.  How long can you walk for?
L:  Oh, well it's half hour to an hour.
R:  You do a half an hour to an hour?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh well, great.  Have you ever done Weight Watchers before?
L:  No, I haven't done Weight Watchers although I do have a girlfriend who's done it and has had gr- wonderful success with it.  And another woman at our church she's doing it and she's a couple of hundred pounds overweight.
R:  Oh my goodness.
L:  And she's lost, in the past year, a hundred and thirty seven pounds I think it was to Weight Watchers.
R:  A hundred and thirty seven pounds.
L:  In a year, yeah.
R:  Oh, that's [inaudible] I only have to do about twenty.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH] see --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- I'm trying to lose weight and I'm only trying to lose about twenty myself so [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, and that makes --
L:  -- and those last twenty pounds after having kids is the hardest to lose, ugh!
R:  Oh yeah, my sister's going through that to.  She's having such a hard time getting it off and, ugh, I haven't had kids yet so I haven't had to go through that.  I can only imagine with the body I have now what it would be like then. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It -- it's not easy to lose it once you have 'em that's for sure.
R:  Oh, that's --
L:  The first one it was easy then the next two makes it even harder [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, 'cause where's your motivation 'cause what if you have another one [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, I'm definitely not having any more so --
R:  So, you're done, yes, so then that makes it easier because I think, "Well, if I'm gonna get pregnant again in a year or two I'm gonna have to go back through it all again" and --
L:  Well, that -- yeah, that was, like, the whole thing.
R:  Yeah, that would be so hard to [NOISE] have to deal with.  Sorry, just dropped something on my trash can.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So, I don't know, I think I really am gonna sign up for Weight Watchers this week.  I talked to somebody in my aerobics class this morning and --
L:  Oh, Weight Watchers is supposed to be really good.
R:  Yeah, she's done really well with it.  She started in October and she's lost fifty five pounds and she loves it --
L:  Oh, fifty five pounds, that's great.
