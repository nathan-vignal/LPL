R:  [MN] 
L:  Uh --
R:  So, um, do you work out?
L:  Uh, no I do not work out.  Not near like I used to.  I -- I did, um, of course years ago I was in the army for four years and had to work out every day but, uh, I don't do it like I us- uh, I like should anyway.  How about you?
R:  [MN] I was in the navy for a little too.
L:  Oh, were ya?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh well, that's good.  Yeah, um --
R:  Exercised a lot there but I do work out.  I work out five to six days a week at the gym.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN] Yeah, that's what I need to be doing and, of course --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- uh, I work about ten, eleven hours a day, five, sometimes six days a week so, um, you know --
R:  Yeah, that's --
L:  -- it kinda makes it tough on the working out.  I do -- do have pool so, uh, I swim quite a bit so I guess --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's my work out so --
R:  Swimming's very good exercise.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, but, uh --
R:  Do you eat good?
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  Do you eat good?
L:  Um, no I'm a bachelor --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't eat like I should [LAUGH].
R:  Neither do I.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I do a lot of fast foods stuff and everything so ... [MN]
R:  I mean, I don't eat that much fast food, like, not really but I don't eat like I should be eating. 
L:  Yeah.  Well, that's the -- I mean, I'm usually -- maybe one time a day, sometimes it's not that much but usually once a day I'll each fast food --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and then I either just, uh, make sandwiches or we'll go out to restaurant or somewhere and sit down and eat which, you know [MN], isn't that good for you but I have salads on occasion so I guess that's okay.
R:  Yeah, that's good.  I eat, like -- I eat maybe like once or twice a day, which is, like, really bad.
L:  Wow, you only eat once or twice a day?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You must be like little or nothing then, Chelle, huh?
R:  [NOISE] I'm muscular --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but --
L:  Well, I guess so if you work out five, six times a day.
R:  I know, I should be eating, you know, a lot more.  I should be eating, like, six times a day.
L:  Yeah, salads or what?  Do you eat salads?
R:  Uh, yeah, um, I'm trying to cut out, uh, bread --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- 'cause, you know, it's not good for [NOISE] you.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, uh red meat is good, I eat that.  Uh, salad, um, I'm still eating candy which I shouldn't.
L:  Chocolate?
R:  Yeah, and all that shit.
L:  [LAUGH] Isn't that every woman's weakness is chocolate.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, yeah, I'm -- I'm not a big chocolate fan, I've never been -- I mean, I eat a little bit of it.  I've never been -- never been that much of sweet fan until just really the couple of years, you know so that --
R:  Get outta here, really?
L:  I don't know if it's that old age thing or what, you know, and [LAUGH] it's terrible.
R:  Hopefully I'll be the opposite.
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  I said, "Hopefully I'll be the opposite".  I won't eat --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- junk foods when I'm older.
L:  Yeah. [MN]
R:  I'm still, uh, trying.
L:  Yeah, still a child.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You, uh -- did you ever run, like, jog?
L:  Yeah, um, well of course I did when I, you know, was in the army.  I did just a little bit before I joined the army, uh, and then of course when I was in the army, uh, oh I mean, uh, just depending on where I was stationed, I mean, there were times we'd go on a four, five, six mile run --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, um, yeah I did a lot of running in the army and then I did a little bit once I got out.  I stayed in shape.  I stayed in shape several years even after I was out of the army doing push ups and sit ups and just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- running and stuff and really just until the last probably three, four years have I, you know, slowed down to where I just don't do like I need to be doing, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  [MN]
R:  What -- did you do PT training every morning in the army?
L:  Yeah, yeah we did, uh, we did PT training, um, uh, like I said, depending on where we were stationed.  I was in Korea and we didn't do as much PT training over there but, like, then I -- uh, when I was at Fort Campbell which is hundred and first, uh, at Fort Campbell in Kentucky, we did it, like, everyday so, you know, [MN] uh, it just depended on where you were at and -- and everything but -- [SIGH] yep, just about every morning I went running. [MN]
R:  Yeah, me too, like, in the -- in boot camp in the navy we had to do it every morning.
L:  Yeah, yeah, do you run now?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you?
R:  I used to run a lot more when I was in high school, like, I used to be, like, on cross country and track and stuff.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And then I stopped and then I just started working out but now I'm getting back into running 'cause it's -- it's good.  Jogging is good like every morning or whatever.
L:  Oh yeah.  Well, that's -- uh, you know, I say, um --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- well I walk quite a bit with my job and stuff but I say I need to at least get back into walking and then maybe eventually just jogging a little bit but, uh, I just always seem to talk myself out of it or something, it's just --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  [MN] -- but, uh --
R:  That's cool.
L:  Do I have an accent? [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Do I?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, the New York accent.
L:  The New York accent.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  [MN] [LIPSMACK]
R:  You lived in Panama all your life? [NOISE]
L:  No, actually, I, uh, was born and raised in Tennessee.
R:  Oh, that's why.
L:  Yeah, so it's --
R:  Kentucky.
L:  Yeah, I was gonna say, it's still that southern accent, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  That's cool.
L:  But [MN] -- so you go to the gym locally there to work out then?
R:  Yeah, like two minutes from me.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  Yeah, it's convenient so I just go there whenever it's, um -- [NOISE] usually night time, like, maybe five on, I'll pick a time to go there.  It closes at eleven so -- on week days.
L:  Wow, eleven at night.
R:  Yeah, it closes at least -- some gyms are twenty four hours, luckily mine's not. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] [NOISE] And you go work out sometimes that late?
R:  Yeah, sometimes I'll -- like I'll -- uh, I'll go to the gym at nine o'clock at night and, like, you know, and wait till it closes at eleven.
L:  Wow.
R:  I spen- I spend about two hours in the gym --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- 'cause like I do -- I do an hour of cardio, then I'll do, uh, a body parts li- lifting and then, uh -- and then I'll do abs.  So, it takes about two hours.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I guess you are in good shape, aren't ya? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yep.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Gotta look good.
L:  You should have went into the army or the marines working out like that. [LAUGH] No, you shouldn't have. [LAUGH]
R:  Marines is too tough.
L:  Yeah.  Yep, if I had to do it over maybe --
R:  So --
L:  -- I'd have probably picked the air force or navy. [MN] Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, the air force is nothing.
L:  Yeah. [MN]
R:  But it's not -- it's all right.  I try to -- before I was lifting weights like, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, a little --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- 'cause, like, they said that, like, um, if you lift light weights, uh, and more repetitions that's how you get, like, you know, more caught up in reps or whatever --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- which is true because, like, if you lift a lot of weight you bulk up so that's why, like, guys are like huge.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause they lift, like, you know, so much weight.  So, I'm gradually increasing my lifting so, like, before I was doing like five, ten pounds I was like, you know, curls for biceps, you know, and now I'm doing fifteen. But I'm gonna -- like, I'm gonna stop at fifteen, I'm not gonna go beyond because I don't wanna get too huge.  That's not good [LAUGH].
L:  Oh yeah, yeah.  Well, that's what I was gonna say.  I was gonna ask you if you cut pretty good [MN], I mean, do you have -- oh obviously if you work out two hours a day then you have quite a good show of muscle.
R:  Yeah, yeah, I have good -- I have good definition [NOISE] in my arms and stuff.
L:  [MN] Yeah.  Yeah, you don't wanna get --
R:  But, nah --
L:  -- you don't wanna get too many muscles. [LAUGH]
R:  No, I don't and, like -- [LAUGH] like, I know.
L:  You don't wanna be one of those body lifter looking types now.
R:  I know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] The guys don't like that.
L:  Yeah. [MN] Oh, sure we do.  No. [LAUGH] That's --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't think, you know, they wanna girl bigger than them to go out with.
L:  Well, you're right there, yeah. [MN]
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause then it's too intimidating.
R:  Oh definitely.
L:  [MN] 
R:  And that's fine. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, yeah, exercising is good.
L:  Yeah, I know, I need to do more of it. [MN] I -- like I said I always talk myself out of it. [MN]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] But -- but maybe I'll get back into before too much longer [SIGH] it's -- you know --
R:  Mm.  I have to drink more water than -- than I should.  I don't drink enough water.
L:  Uh, well see now there where at -- let's where I -- um, that's the one thing I do beat you at 'cause I drink tons of water.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like what?  Like eight -- eight cups a day.
L:  Um, I probably, uh -- of the bottled water I probably have about [MN] four a day of the, like, the twenty ounce.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's huge.
L:  [MN].
