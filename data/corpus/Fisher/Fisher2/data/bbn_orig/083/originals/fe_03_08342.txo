R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name's Diana.  I'm from Tennessee.
L:  Okay, and I'm Sue and I'm from California [NOISE].
R:  Oh, nice to ya.
L:  Nice meeting you.
R:  Um, do you exercise regularly?
L:  I do.  I just started actually in January, um, I cu- uh, I joined Curves.
R:  Oh, uh-huh.  How is that?
L:  I love it.  And --
R:  I've heard of it, I -- I don't --
L:  -- and I don't like exercising.
R:  Yeah, me neither. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] But -- but this is really nice.  It's, um, it's all women --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and it's not like it used to be where everybody would get dressed up, you know, really look good. [NOISE]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You just wear what you wanna wear.
R:  Yeah.  Is there a lot of heavy women in there or ...?
L:  There's a lot of heavy women, um --
R:  That, I think, is the biggest drawback is people going to a gym or whatever and seeing all these size two people and --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- you know, and -- and --
L:  Exactly.  Uh, people feel very comfortable in this and I happen to have rheumatoid arthritis and the doctor said that this program is very good for me.
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  So, uh, it's because you don't use weights, you don't use any heavy weights --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's all hydraulics.
R:  Oh, in the water then?
L:  Uh, no, no --
R:  No?
L:  -- it's, um, the hydraulic machines so that, uh, you're pushing against --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it and it's a, um, oh how -- what's the word for it?  It -- there's no weights used and it's very easy on the body on -- on the joints.
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  So, it -- it's a little bit expensive, it costs thirty nine dollars a month.
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  Um --
R:  But you find it's worth it?
L:  But you can go as many times as you want every week.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, I really enjoy it and, like I said, I don't like exercising but y- I needed incentive to go --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and this -- this does it for me.  How about you?
R:  Yeah, that's -- that's my problem is the incentive -- you know, I mean, I -- I want it so bad but I have a house -- I have three teenage sons and my husband --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and they're not real supportive when it comes to encouragement, you know, it's --it's, "Aren't you gonna go walking" or, you know, something --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's not -- it's not, you know, like where you have a girlfriend that calls you and says, "Come on, it's time to go".
L:  Right.
R:  You know, um, whereas a place that you go to you have to be accountable, you know --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and -- and that's what I feel like I need.
L:  Exactly.
R:  I know in Knoxville I believe they've got, uh, one of those Curves --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- places.
L:  Is that close to you?
R:  Um, it's about twenty miles away.
L:  Okay, that's kinda far actually.
R:  Yeah, yeah, so it would --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it would -- I've thought about doing, um -- like going to the -- we have a community centre though with a swimming pool --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, you know, that's something I've tried to do also.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's just easier said than done.  You know, it's -- it's -- yeah, it's one of those things that you have to make yourself go and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, you know, I --
L:  That's the hardest part about the whole thing is --
R:  Is getting there, I know.
L:  -- is getting to go.
R:  Yeah, I -- I joined a gym that's not five minutes from my house and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I would drive by and say, "Oh, there's too many people" or --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- "Oh, it's too late at night" or --
L:  You had excuses for it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's horrible, I mean, I don't know what it would take --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you know, I -- I just don't know and -- and I'm horrible I -- I've, uh, seriously thought about starting that Atkins Diet again --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, you know, but the --
L:  I -- I've heard that --
R:  -- exercise --
L:  -- works pretty well.
R:  Um, yeah, they say -- the doctor who had told me about it said that it's for -- um, they use this for heart patients who've got to lose weight quickly.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, so that they can have surgery or whatever.
L:  That's right.
R:  And it's -- I mean, it's -- it's great because you can eat all you want but -- oh, I just crave sweets.
L:  Oh, so do I.
R:  I mean, I just crave them.
L:  Choc- chocolate is my friend.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] And you [inaudible] --
L:  It n- it's not just for breakfast anymore.
R:  No, no.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And you think, "Well, gosh, if I just have one, you know, I'll be okay" and then, you know, one turns into the whole bag and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- then you get depressed again and you say, "Oh, I've done blown it I might as well eat this grilled cheese or --"
L:  That's right.
R:  -- you know. [LAUGH]
L:  That's right.
R:  It's a neverending battle.
L:  I know.
R:  And it's horrible --
L:  I kno- --
R:  -- my mot- my mother all her life did, uh, it's kinda like Slimfast but it was, uh, some -- it was like a Amway thing that they did, they work as representatives, you know --
L:  Oh okay, right.  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and -- and they're -- they're both in their seventies now and thinner than I've ever seen them in -- in their entire lives --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- but -- you know, and then I -- they were just here not very long ago and, I mean, I was like twice -- twice of them, you know, and, I mean, I've got -- I've got any incentive that I want to do it and I just can't -- I can't just do it.
L:  Right, but when you -- when you don't people in your own home encouraging you that's hard.
R:  Yeah, I mean, my husband --
L:  That's very --
R:  -- bought me an exercise bike and all that and, you know, but it just --
L:  I -- you know, I've had the treadmill and I've had an elliptical trainer --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it's just -- it doesn't fit in the house, it's not -- um, our home isn't large enough to have it in the room --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so we had to have on the patio in the backyard and there's nothing out there, y- you can't listen music, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you can't watch TV or anything so you're just doing it and it's very boring.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And that's why I joined Curves because I needed somebody to push me on.
R:  Yeah, that's what I need.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's what I need, a girlfriend or somebody to -- to come by and say, "Let's go walking" or, you know, it's just --
L:  Right.  Are you --
R:  -- and, I mean, I have dogs that I can walk and all that and it's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's easier not to.
L:  Sure it is.
R:  You know, I take 'em for their walks but I -- I walk -- you know, it's like I'm, "Ho hum, ho hum".
L:  Slowly, I know.
R:  You know. [LAUGH]
L:  I know and the dog wants to stop and look at everything.
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Oh.
R:  I don't know, and I just -- I have no will power and I don't know what my problem is.
L:  Oh.
R:  But, I mean, I've got four years until my youngest son is out of the house and, I mean, I have a whole life ahead of me --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, and I don't want to it fat, I've done the last twenty years fat and, you know, I just --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I don't know what it'll take and I -- I hate spend money because I know all I have to do is eat right and exercise.
L:  Oh sure, you know what the right [NOISE] thing to do is --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- but --
R:  -- and here, you know --
L:  -- none of us do it.
R:  Yeah, and, you know, I -- I thought about, uh, that LA Weight Loss, we just go a new one in town here and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, they want four hundred and something dollars --
L:  That's the problem is that they all --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ask for so much up front.
R:  Yeah, and -- and when you know exactly what it is you have to do.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, that's the worst thing is -- is --
L:  Right.
R:  -- paying somebody just to say, "Oh, you've done good today, you've lost a pound".
L:  Right.
R:  You know, god I could pay my husband four hundred dollars and, I mean, he'd say that to me. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] That would be easy. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I don't know, maybe --
L:  I think your best maybe is to do -- do the community center with the swimming and all.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It would get you moving.
R:  Yeah, and it's -- I mean, there's -- I -- I love to swim.  I always swam as a kid.  I was raised in California.
L:  Oh okay.
R:  Um, so I always swam and all that and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, it just -- there's always some excuse why I can't do it.
L:  Right.  Oh.
R:  And I just hate that I don't -- it'll happen though, I mean, I -- I -- I want it but there'll be a time when something's gonna happen and probably -- hopefully it won't be life threatening, that's --
L:  Oh really.
R:  -- gonna me do that --
L:  Really.
R:  -- you know.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  But, I mean, I'm embarrassed, I -- I'm embarrassed for my husband, you know, thank god he's stuck by me through gain -- I mean, I've probably gained eighty pounds in twenty years, you know, since --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- we've been married and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, I just -- I think a lot of it started as depression, you know, I had three kids under five --
L:  Right.
R:  -- when I was twenty three years old --
L:  Right, that does it --
R:  -- you know, that --
L:  -- right there, yeah.
R:  -- and, you know, I didn't care and I just eat and eat and eat and who cares, you know, and now that I do care it's, you know, it's -- it --
L:  It's hard.
R:  -- like my husband said, "It didn't come on overnight, you're not going to lose it overnight".
L:  Right, it's very hard to take it off.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Oh well --
R:  But, oh no, I'm glad you're doing the Curves though, I'm glad that's making you feel better.
L:  Yeah, I just wanted to do it just -- not -- I don't need to lose the weight per se [NOISE] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I wanted to keep moving, especially with this arthritis, I'm afraid -- I've seen that my hands are starting to, um, be deformed and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I didn't want it to get any further, I wanna be able to keep moving.
R:  Is that what'll happen if you don't do it?
L:  Yeah, if I don't keep moving, yeah, the -- the body starts deforming and --
R:  Oh, that's not good.
L:  -- that's not good, no.  So, that's -- that's my wake up call right there.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  You know, and, um --
R:  And I bet that --
L:  -- and this stuff works.  I mean, it's very nice, the first month I went and after not doing any exercising at all --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I lost eleven and a half inches.
R:  Wow.
L:  And, like I said, I don't need to the weight, I didn't lose weight I gained a pound that first month.
R:  But you lost inches, yeah.
L:  It was because it was muscle --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and they -- everybody says muscles weighs more than fact --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- or whatever but -- um, so that's what happened with me and -- and it's very interesting, eleven and a half inches all over, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you -- you lose some in your arms a little --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and your legs, like that.
R:  And it's probably nice, you probably met some people in your -- in your area.
L:  Oh, all kinds of people.
R:  Yeah.
L:  There's all kinds of ladies, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that you meet that you, you know -- but that's the only place, I've never -- I'm -- I see them around but I haven't gotten friendly with them and done anything else so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that -- that's okay, that's okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But it's nice to be with, uh --
R:  There's somebody there you can, you know, talk to or whatever and --
L:  Right --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, uh, like I said, there are some very heavy women there and -- but they're t- they're mov- trying, they're moving, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They -- they're trying so --
R:  You know what kills me, I was at Walmart yesterday and saw a lady in one of those, um, what do you call 'em, like, rascals[?], you know what I'm talking about --
L:  Oh right, yeah, sure.
R:  -- the -- the mobile wheelchair --
L:  Right.
R:  -- things.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And this lady was so big and I watched her get her prescriptions filled and she was filling, like, Tactil and things like that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I'm thinking, "Lady, you would not need that stuff if you'd get off your butt" --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know and it wasn't that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it was one of the stores', you know, so she had to walk into the store.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, and I realize that it's probably hard for her but, I mean, I thought I was big but this woman was big, you know --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and -- and I just -- she had like six prescriptions and --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- I'm thinking, "You probably wouldn't need half that stuff if you could just do --" and then I'm looking in the --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- mirror going, "Look at you" you know.
L:  Well --
R:  Here I'm talking smack about all these people and, you know, I've got no room to talk.
L:  Well, yeah, but maybe -- maybe you can look at her and think I don't wanna be in that position.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  But I tell you it's kind strange though because I have no health problems whatsoever, you know --
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  -- I was at the doctor today and -- and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- blood pressure, everything's great and it's just --
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  -- it's just fat, you know, it's --
L:  Well --
R:  -- it's --
