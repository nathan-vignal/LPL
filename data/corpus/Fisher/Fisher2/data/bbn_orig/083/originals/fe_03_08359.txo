L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Sarah.
R:  Hi, I'm Leanne, I'm in Idaho.
L:  Oh, I'm in New York. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  [NOISE] Um, so do you exercise regularly? [NOISE]
R:  I do.  I do.  
L:  [MN]
R:  I actually just ran this morning, I am in the middle of training --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for a marathon, my first.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  So -- so, I kin- I -- I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- exercise not every day but --
L:  Mm. [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, for the most part three or four days a week.
L:  How far do you run [NOISE] usually?
R:  Well, today I ran about five --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- um, I'm just slowly building up so --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I'm -- I'm a -- only about -- let's see, my marathon is the first --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- weekend in November --
L:  Mhm [NOISE].
R:  -- so every Saturday I do a long run --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, this next Saturday'll be thirteen miles but --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- then -- but then during the week it's usually --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, anywhere between four, five, six --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- somewhere around there.  How about you?
L:  Uh, I actually run and I play tennis a lot so ...
R:  Oh, you do?
L:  [NOISE] Yes, yes.
R:  You -- you just run for fun.
L:  Well, I run to keep in shape for tennis so [NOISE] --
R:  Oh okay.
L:  -- so it balances out [NOISE] I guess.
R:  Oh -- oh hold on a minute I have to -- hold on just a second. [NOISE]
L:  Okay. 
R:  So, you, um, you don't race then at all?
L:  No, no, no.
R:  It's --
L:  It's just like a conditioning thing [NOISE], I guess.
R:  Yeah, that's -- well same with me, do you have kids?
L:  No, I'm only twenty. [NOISE]
R:  Oh [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I have six children.
L:  Wow. [NOISE] Wow
R:  So, that's part of the reason I run is because it takes a lot to keep up with six kids --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- and I thought --
L:  -- how do you find time for that? [NOISE]
R:  What?
L:  How do you find time for that?
R:  Well, like this morning I ran about six thirty AM --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- before -- before they were all up and stuff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I usually just have to run early in the morning or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- e- you know, sometimes I can run if my husband's home --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but he -- y- you know, that's -- that's always just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- hit and miss I'd rather get it done early and out of the way.
L:  Mhm.  Yes.
R:  But, um -- and especially this time of year it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean, I don't know what it's like in New York but --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- now it's -- it's gonna be in the high nineties --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- no- not humid at all but if, you know, if don't run before twelve noon --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's like I don't -- I don't wanna really go out and --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- [LAUGH] run six miles --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and be dying.  So, how about you when do you run?
L:  [NOISE] Um, I actually like running -- like during the summer I have a lot of free time so I like running when it' hot 'cause it doesn't get that hot --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- here so --
R:  It's not that hot or it is?
L:  [NOISE] It's like mid seventies, eighties.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Yeah, and I like that so --
R:  Ye- oh yeah.
L:  -- I run, yeah. [NOISE] Um --
R:  That'd -- that would be -- is it humid there to all?
L:  Uh, not too bad, no.  No.
R:  Oh, that's what we -- I just noticed a few weekends ago when I was out --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- running that it just seems really humid --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it was kind of suffocating --
L:  Yeah [NOISE], yeah.
R:  -- to me because I just thought not only is it hotter than normal it's, like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just breathing and all that was really heavy and I just thought --
L:  Like drowning, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well we had some friends that were just out here from Indiana --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- and they just said, "This isn't even humid".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "You -- you don't know" 'cause Idaho's really dry.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I thought, "I'm glad I don't because --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- I'd probably be only be able to run one or two miles before I was --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- was dead".  So --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Do you listen to music when run?
R:  -- it's like --
L:  Oh sorry --
R:  What?
L:  -- go on. [LAUGH]
R:  I was just gonna ask you about your tennis.
L:  Oh, oh I play at [NOISE], um, college level. 
R:  Oh, you do?  What college?
L:  Yeah.  Wells College.
R:  Oh okay.
L:  It's a --
R:  Is -- is that -- that's not that women's --
L:  Yeah, it is, yeah.
R:  Okay, I've heard of it.  Yeah.
L:  Wow, out in Idaho. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Do you -- is it, um -- so you're on the, like, the tennis -- the college team?
L:  Mhm.  Yep.
R:  Singles, doubles what?
L:  Oh I play both, doubles and singles. [NOISE]
R:  All right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's great.
L:  It's fun.
R:  Am I ever gonna see you in any, uh, professional tournaments or ...?
L:  The Olympics maybe, no. [LAUGH] We're a very, very, very small school so ...
R:  I bet.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like what?
L:  Uh, we have four hundred on a good day [NOISE] [LAUGH].
R:  But i- I mean, is it -- is it, like, division one?
L:  Oh, division three, very small division three.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh still that's -- that's, you know, oh it's tennis that something.
L:  It's fun.  Yeah, it's better than nothing, I guess.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And so do you have to do other things for the team?  I mean, like do you guys have to li- lift weights and that kind of stuff?
L:  [NOISE] Uh, they have personal trainer come in and talk to us, like, twice a season to keep us in [NOISE] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and a nutritionist so we have a pretty good regimen, I guess, so --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  Yeah, that's help.
R:  An- and then you have to, of course, practise and have --
L:  Oh yeah, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- everyday and stuff.
L:  It's okay, [NOISE] that's fun stuff, so ...
R:  Is it outdoors, indoors?
L:  Uh, we have both so if it's raining we practice indoors and if not we go outside. [NOISE]
R:  Well, that's good, yeah.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  So, you can --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you can get it in no matter what. 
L:  Helps my tan too, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Let's see what else, I used to lift a lot in college when I was --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- younger, uh, but I have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I have actually have a weight bench here at home but I --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I rarely use it [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And I've been thinking about doing Pilates, have you ever tried that?
L:  Yeah, I do do Pilates.
R:  You do?  Do you like it?
L:  [NOISE] That's really great for your abs.  Yeah.
R:  Well, that's what I heard, I mean --
L:  Yeah [NOISE].
R:  -- you can imagine after six children that my abs are --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I'm actually not overweight at all, I'm not --
L:  Mhm, yeah, I wouldn't doubt it.
R:  -- I mean, I'm in great shape but it's just like --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- those stomach muscles just never quite recover and I --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- and a friend of mine was telling me about Pilates and I thought, "Oh, I should try it".  In fact, I actually tried to, um, get from the library the Windsor[?] Pilates --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- 'cause I have never seen it done or anything but --
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  -- I've heard so many people just raving about --
L:  [NOISE] Mm.
R:  -- it I thought, "Well, you know, maybe that's something I could do on my non running days".
L:  Yeah, it's actually a lot of fun [NOISE] and it's -- it's challenging but it's a lot more -- it's easier to keep up than sit ups and crunches because --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's not as monotonous, I guess.
R:  It's -- it -- and is it pretty -- I mean, it's -- it -- from what I understand it's pretty slow, um --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- steady.
L:  It's methodical, it -- it's -- it's relaxing too.  It's kinda like yoga but more intense, I would say.
R:  Oh really.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you do that just at home then or do you -- do you go --
L:  I go to the local YMCA for that [NOISE].
R:  Oh really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, that's what I was just thinking about doing is the gym that's really close to our house --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just started a Pilates --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- thing.  I thought, well, um, in the fall --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- in the winter when I'm not wanting to get out and run in dark I could --
L:  [NOISE] Mm.
R:  -- maybe, you know, go there some --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I [inaudible].
R:  -- on -- you know, on some days and stuff but I don't know it might --
L:  I would check out the video too because my roommate did it because she was a dancer --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and so she showed me how to do it first 'cause if I had just gone to the gym and done that I would have looked like a fool --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- because it's kinda challenging at first so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  But it's fun.
R:  But, I mean, you've noticed a difference?
L:  Oh definitely, yeah, within the first, like, three weeks a definite difference.
R:  Were you totally sore after or ...?
L:  The first couple of times, yeah, I felt like I was having cramps but --
R:  Oh no. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] -- it's worth it, I guess, I don't know.
R:  Well, I mean, I th- I can think of well I'm in good shape from running, like, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- my heart's in good shape and my legs but I just thought my stomach is prob- you know --
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  -- after one class I'll probably be dead and never wanna try it again, so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I don't know if I should join the gym and then find out I never wanna do it.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, yeah.
R:  But they do have a local gym here that has just -- it's kinda like a punch card thing where you can go just -- you pay for so many classes --
L:  That's neat, yeah.
R:  Yeah, so if you only use one a year, I mean, you don't --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  -- you don't keep paying for not using the gym -- 
L:  Yeah, that's -- [NOISE] that's really good.
R:  -- so I thought, "Well, that might be something at least get me started".
L:  Mhm.
R:  And see if I wanna --
L:  It couldn't hurt to try something new so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I hear there's -- there's different kinds of Pilates too.
L:  Oh, I didn't know that.
R:  Yeah, like I -- I don't know what, I mean, there's like some that may be more strenuous than others or --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I -- I don't know, I don't understand any of it but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I just thought, "Well, I better -- maybe I better do a little research before I --"
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  "-- do it so I know which one I'm getting into".
L:  [NOISE] Mhm. [NOISE] Couldn't hurt.
R:  Anything else you do for fun?
L:  [NOISE] Um, I walk a lot, I guess.
R:  You do?
L:  Uh, like when I'm too tired to run or sometimes, like --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I don't know, do your knees bother you ever from running?
R:  No, they haven't yet.  
L:  No.
R:  I've heard that [LAUGH] -- people always say their knees but --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I mean, I'm kinda just -- I mean, I've ran, um --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- on and off for about -- only about five years.
L:  [NOISE] Wow.
R:  But this is the first time I've done a -- heavy training, my husband's a big --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- marathoner so he -- like, he just ran the Boston Marathon this past April --
L:  Wow, mhm.
R:  -- and he -- you know, he was training so much and stuff right before he just really -- you know, his knee was just kind of -- was started bothering him from all the training and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, he was putting in so many miles.  So, I'm kinda cautious about it --
L:  Mhm, that's good.
R:  -- I mean, I know I won't do it on my first marathon 'cause I'm just hoping to get through it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, um -- but I know that there's a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, fine line between getting your miles in and, you know, just really overdoing it so --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, yeah, overkill.
R:  Most people I hear with knee injuries though tend to be, maybe a little overweight or --
L:  Mhm, mhm, more impact on --
R:  -- just trying to do --
L:  -- joint, yeah.
R:  Yeah, trying to do too much too soon and so --
L:  Mhm [NOISE].
R:  -- I've been -- I've been pretty cautious so far.
L:  That's good. [MN]
R:  I'm just -- like I said, I'm just hoping I survive it and not --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- not die at twenty -- twenty two miles.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  So --
L:  How long is the first one?
R:  What?
L:  How long is the marathon?
R:  It's -- a marathon is twenty six miles.
L:  Oh, oh right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Greek mythology. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So, I, you know, I -- I'm hoping to fi- maybe finish around four hours --
L:  Wow, yeah.
R:  -- but that -- that may be totally unrealistic.  That's about a nine minute mile and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I can run that pretty easily for, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- fifteen miles but it's, you know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- who knows about those last --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'll probably be crawling, I don't know [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Anyway, um, yeah that's all I really do is run right now.
L:  Mm, do you listen to music or anything when you run or ...?
R:  Well, I try and run with somebody most of the time --
L:  That's good.  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, if I'm by myself I almost always listen to music --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because it just helps --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- pass the time.
L:  Definitely, yeah. [NOISE]
R:  But I have a -- a -- a kind of a running partner that we run together in the mornings and then --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  -- lots of times on the weekends my husband runs with me so --
L:  That's good. [NOISE]
R:  -- it's -- the time goes by a lot faster if I'm visiting or at least somebody's there and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, you can say something to every once in a while --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- but, um -- but if I have to run by myself I almost always put on my headphones and stuff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  What about you?
L:  Uh, I usually -- I like running by myself 'cause, I don't know, it's just an escape, but I always listen to music 'cause otherwise I just get bored [LAUGH].
R:  Well, where do you run in New York?
L:  Uh, I go to the track.  We have a local track but --
R:  What?
L:  At the high school track.
R:  Oh okay.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Okay, so you must live close to the high school then.  
L:  Mm, yep, in the small town, so [NOISE] it's not too bad.
R:  Okay.
L:  [MN]
R:  Well, I usually end up running around my neighborhood if I just have to run from here, which gets kinda old after a while but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- where I live we have river with a nice green belt --
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  -- that -- yeah, I mean, it -- it can on for, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- well, the -- like my last run was about twelve miles and that was easily done on the green belt so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there's always some -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- always some good, you know, leaves[?] there, I saw a deer out in the field and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, some -- some, you know, stuff along the water but if I run in my neighborhood after a while it's, like, the same old houses over and over [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, exactly.  The same people staring at you.
R:  Well, yeah, well a lot of times if I run early, you know, I'll see people come out in their pyjamas or bathrobes --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to get their papers or something and I always --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- have to stifle a chuckle because they usually don't expect to see somebody running right passed ...
