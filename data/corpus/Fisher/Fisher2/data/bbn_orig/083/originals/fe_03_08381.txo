R:  Ah, my name is Wendy.  [NOISE]
L:  [MN]  Hi, I'm Sara.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  Oh, there's actually a person.  [LAUGH]
L:  Y- [LAUGH] yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  No.  Last night there was no one.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  O- oh, -- oh, gosh.
R:  I talked alone for ten minutes.  [LAUGH]
L:  Fun.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Do you exercise?  [SIGH]
L:  Ye- -- u- um, [LIPSMACK] yes, ... well ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Mm, [SIGH] n- [LAUGH] not as much as --
R:  [SIGH]  I didn't say, ah, how --
L:  -- I should.
R:  Oh, okay.  See, I didn't say how l- long?  [LAUGH]
L:  A- ah ...  [LAUGH]
R:  Or how many times ... in a week?  [LAUGH]
L:  U- u- um, [MN] ah, probably -- I -- I just joined a gym.  [MN]  I joined -- ah, it's actually this woman's gym called Curves.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, [SIGH] yeah, --
L:  I don't know if you've --
R:  -- I've -- I've seen and read about it.
L:  It actually -- it -- it's pretty interesting, like, it's -- it really -- like, it times you for the amount of, ah, [SIGH] -- of exercising you do.  So, it's only like a half an hour a- and it's actually been working.  It's pretty thorough, so ... [SIGH] --
R:  Well, it gets you moving.
L:  -- I'm trying to go.
R:  [SIGH]  It gets you -- do- does anyone ... w- watch you?   [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  It's actually -- well, yeah, [NOISE] in -- in a sense.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  It's -- [SIGH] it's basically [SIGH] -- it's like eight m- machines kind of set up in a circle [SIGH] --
R:  Right, a circuit.
L:  -- and a -- a voice tells you over the --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- every thirty seconds to switch machine.  So, you're just -- you're f- fast paced.  It's interesting.  [SIGH]  It moves.
R:  [SIGH]  But no one's like, w- [LAUGH] watching in case you --
L:  Oh, no.  Not -- not in an uncomfortable way and it's all women, like, it's very comfortable.
R:  No, I meant watching as in [NOISE] maybe someone -- a trainer so you don't do something wrong and [SIGH] -- I don't know wrench --
L:  Oh, oh, there's --
R:  -- your b- back.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- some [SIGH] -- yeah, there's some -- there's some people there that -- that make sure that everything's going right.  They teach you the first day --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- how to do everything so ...
R:  [SIGH]  Do they pick up the revs aft- -- o- or you just started so you don't ... know.
L:  Excuse me?
R:  [SIGH]  W- well, di- -- like, after you're there did they explain, like, after a while that they [MN] [SIGH] put more weight on the machines or --
L:  Oh, see, they're hydraulic machines so everything is --
R:  Oh, cool!
L:  -- ah, automatic there.  I know it's pretty cool.
R:  [NOISE]  Oh!
L:  Makes me want to exercise more but [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But ... y- yeah.
L:  -- it doesn't always work out that way.
R:  Have you tried Pilates?  [SIGH]
L:  I haven't.  Have -- do you do that?
R:  Y- yeah.  It -- it's, --oh, my goodness, ...  [SIGH]
L:  Is it -- it's really -- it's really --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- good?  I've heard --
R:  It's amazing.  [SIGH]
L:  I heard that it's pretty strenuous though.
R:  Oh, yeah.  [SIGH]  Oh, but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it -- it -- no, it's not strenuous per se, not like what you're doing.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, ... there's two kinds.  T- there's the mat classes but then there's the reformers [SIGH] --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- which is, like, on pulley systems.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  And, u- um, you go to a -- a -- you have to go to someone who really is ... a certified Pilates teacher or you c- could [LAUGH] hurt yourself.  [SIGH]
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  But it is -- [SIGH] if you have a -- a bad back, I used to dance so I have a bad back, bad hips [SIGH] but --
L:  I do -- I have scoliosis so my -- my spine --
R:  Oh, you -- g- gosh, do you have health insurance?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  I do.
R:  Ah, no, but [SIGH] ah, most insurance ... pays for a good portion i- if you find [SIGH] a registered Pilates, ah, therapist.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  Um, which I think you can ... do a search on Pilates and it'll show you [SIGH] the registered people and they're physio therapists.  [SIGH]
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  W- -- the first time you go you will finish up, you'll be drenched in sweat.  [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You will have done nothing but [SIGH] like lie on this little -- these boxes and they'll put these little p- pulleys and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] you'll maybe do f- five.  [SIGH]  And --
L:  Wow!  [NOISE]
R:  -- within those f- five you'll go, "Oh, my God".  [SIGH]  And --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- they'll just kind of do different little things --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [SIGH] and when you're done you'll stand up and it's like someone just sucked your stomach back to your spine.
L:  W- w- wow!  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  And you'll be standing straight and it f- feels good.
L:  Is it --
R:  [SIGH]  It's --
L:  -- do you lose weight or ...?
R:  Oh, yeah.  [SIGH]  O- o- oh, ho, ho, [LAUGH] --
L:  So, you can?
R:  -- oh, yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  It's interesting.  I -- I have a friend who --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- who's been doing Pilates over the past few years, and [SIGH] he just loves it.  He's -- he talks about it all the time.
R:  Yeah, but you've got to -- especially if -- if you've got medical things [SIGH] you've got to find a ... registered physical therapist ... who is +registered with Pilates.  They'll put you [SIGH] on the machines.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They're just ... everything is on a pulley system except one that looks ... either like a sex toy [SIGH] or a trapeze.  [SIGH]
L:  What did you say?
R:  I think that's ones -- is that the cadillac -- it -- [SIGH] the ... p- pulley boxes is the reformer.  I w- went --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and actually bought a reformer for at home.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And it's ... [MN] y- you won't believe -- y- you're body shapes differently.
L:  W- w- wow!
R:  It's the be- -- and you don't have to, like, run around.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Wow, that's good.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's my problem.  I feel like I slouch all the time and [SIGH] --
R:  Oh, you won't --
L:  -- I kind --
R:  -- you won't.  If you two days a week ...
L:  And that'll ...
R:  It -- it's just the most amazing [SIGH] thing in the world.
L:  Now, is it like -- is it in a c- class so there's other --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- people doing it with you?
R:  N- no, usually [SIGH] there are mat classes.  You don't ... get the same thing as ... w- working [SIGH] -- when you go to a real Pilates class, which has ... the reformer which is ... like a wooden thing with boxes that slide and a pulley system --
L:  O- okay.  [SIGH]
R:  -- [MN] that's a one on one kind of thing because also there are therapists.  They're watching you 'cause if you -- if -- there's one where you kind of [SIGH] s- stand on the little boxes [LAUGH] and they slide and if there isn't someone there [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]  You can get y- yourself into trouble.
R:  Oh, there's a world of hurt.  A world --
L:  Ah --
R:  -- of hurt.
L:  -- okay.
R:  That's why only r- registered people.  [SIGH]  But it's -- I swear by it.  I ju- just went back to it and [SIGH] --
L:  That's g- great.
R:  -- it's a [NOISE] night and day difference and you ca- -- you're just -- you do stand [NOISE] taller because [SIGH] every movement you do is from ... the stomach area and [SIGH] it pulls on the muscles that you --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you do lose weight.  And, [SIGH] oh, yeah, within five minutes you'll be drenched in s- [LAUGH] sweat.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, God, [SIGH] is it -- have you ever tried, like, yoga or any of those, like, other --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like, alternative kind of --
R:  I tried yoga, um, I'm sorry I -- I just [NOISE] -- I don't think it's --
L:  No, I've never done it before so ...
R:  -- it's -- I don't think it g- gets you ... limber if you're not already [NOISE] limber.
L:  Okay.
R:  [SIGH]  Um, --
L:  Like, really flexible and, like --
R:  Yeah, it's -- you know you need to warm up and there's all different kinds of yoga and [SIGH] it's -- where Pilates is ... somewhat on that principle.  [NOISE]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  But it stretches -- it stret- -- you know, if someone really stretches you well --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- how good you feel?
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  It's that b- but it also builds the muscles [SIGH] and because ... just of the exercises you're building your stomach muscle, [SIGH] 'cause your body knows how to balance itself.
L:  I see.
R:  It's -- it's amazing.  Yoga has never [SIGH] ... been one of my favorites [NOISE] and I --
L:  Y- yeah.  I'm --
R:  -- used --
L:  -- it sounds int- -- I mean [SIGH] I have a friend who also -- he -- he takes, like, it's called the hot yoga class.
R:  Oh, not out -- [LAUGH] not out --  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I ... read about those.  I don't like heat to begin with.
L:  I know.  It -- it sounds bizarre to me.  I don't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I just can't imagine that, but --
R:  Mystic Indian, ah, cruelty.  [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  That's it.
R:  It's like, "W- we're going to put you in strange positions and we're going to have it hotter than blazes in here [SIGH] --"
L:  Oh, God.
R:  "-- so that everyone can s- sweat, you know, and you'll repent".
L:  You know, I --
R:  No, no, no, no.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I've seen -- I pass by a -- by a hot yoga studio [SIGH] and it'll be -- it's -- there's -- it's an open window on the street and [SIGH] it'll be freezing outside, but you look in this window and it's fogs up.  Everyone looks like they're ... being tortured.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  It's like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's -- I just can't even imagine, like, -- like, ah, people pay to go to these classes every single week, though.  [SIGH]
R:  Well, God love them.  [SIGH]  Now --
L:  Y- yeah, I -- I see -- I feel like there must be something to it if it attracts so many --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- people, but I -- I don't know.
R:  No, ... and that's why there's ... Joe Millionaire and everything else, [SIGH] you know, [LAUGH] it --.
L:  Yes.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- it's the latest flavor on the block.  [SIGH]
L:  Ex- -- I'm sure.
R:  But trainer, I've gone through trainers which I adore.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  That watch you and weight lifting.
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  [SIGH]  All of those kind of weight bearing things are really great for bad backs.  [SIGH]
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  And the more m- muscle you build the more weight you lose.  [SIGH]
L:  That's true.
R:  So, it's --
L:  I'm not -- I'm not so concerned about losing weight as much as I am just kind of getting toned, [NOISE] you know.  Like, [SIGH] I just feel like I'm pret- -- I -- I'm out of shape, like --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- ah, I -- I'm --
R:  Weight --
L:  -- not really into -- like, I'm not trying to lose I'm not over weight at all so it's not my b- biggest concern but [SIGH] just -- just to be comfortable, you know.
R:  [NOISE]  Well, P- Pilates -- any of the weight l- lifting kind of things [SIGH] is --
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  -- it's the best and I w- was trying to get my best friend to go.  [SIGH]
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  "Why don't -- there's a new gym in [LAUGH] -- down in LA [SIGH] in West Hollywood, we can go".  And she's going, "No.  No".  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "No.  No".
L:  No.  No.
R:  "I don't want to".  [SIGH]  But it's --
L:  Yeah, see I live in New York in the --
R:  Oh, I hate you.
L:  -- in the city, so ...
R:  I'm from New York o- [LAUGH] originally.  [LAUGH]
L:  O- o- oh!  [NOISE]
R:  You've got --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but that's their -- the -- actually, Jo- -- the Joseph -- [SIGH] the original Joseph Pilates studio is in New York.
L:  Is it?
R:  Yeah, and also [NOISE] in New York is Lottie Burke which is ... b- basically, the sort of l- like the same principle.
L:  Okay.
R:  [MN]  So, --
L:  I'll look into that.  That's interesting.
R:  -- oh, you're -- you're -- w- w- w- well easy, you know, if you were in m- middle America somewhere you might be screwed.  [SIGH]
L:  Ouch!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Basically, eh?
R:  But if y- you're in New York, yeah, there a -- there is a Joseph Pilates [SIGH] and they do have r- registered [SIGH] physical therapists.
L:  Excellent.  Excellent.
R:  Real live ... p- people.  [SIGH]  But it's --
L:  Oh, the -- I -- I'm very interested.  I'd like to try that.  I'd also like to try [SIGH] a- ah, there's a --
