R:  I'm twenty one.
L:  Mhm. [LAUGH] 
R:  Fifty's not old though.
L:  Yeah, well [MN] it's relative, I suppose.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  But --
R:  So, where -- where do you usually --
L:  What?
R:  Where do you usually go to exercise?
L:  Um, well I live -- I live in Manhattan and there's, uh, this park on the river; like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- right along the island that, um, has like a running trail.  I run there a lot and I belong to a gym so I do weight training in that --
R:  So --
L:  -- gym.  
R:  Serious about it?
L:  Yeah, I -- I used to be kind of fat so I got to exercise and I lost a lot of weight and then I just keep doing it.  It's definitely become --
R:  That's good.
L:  -- part of my life.
R:  That's good.
L:  Yeah.  It's been a good change.
R:  [SIGH] My youngest takes weight trainings [inaudible]. [LAUGH] --
L:  He what?
R:  During college he takes weight trainings.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And he enjoys that. [SIGH] 
L:  Good.
R:  Um --
L:  Do you take any, um, any like vitamins -- multi vitamins or --
R:  I was taking B vitamins but I tend to forget 'em. [LAUGH] [SIGH] Do you take a lot of stuff to 
L:  Um, yeah, I take like -- I take a daily multi vitamin and then I take, um -- I take glucose.  I mean, 'cause I have like knee joint pain sometimes.
R:  For -- for your joints?  Right.
L:  Yeah, it helps, um, like keep my knees strong.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I also like twisted my ankle playing basketball once so I take it for that too; to like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- keep my ankle -- the cartilage in tact.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Has it been a long time since you hurt 'em?
L:  Um, I hurt my ankle earlier this year.
R:  Mm.
L:  It's been now like five months.  Um, but my -- my knee's it's just like -- I didn't like hurt it specifically.  It's just, um --
R:  It's probably from your running.
L:  Yeah, it sure has a lot to do with the running.
R:  Yeah. [SIGH] 
L:  But -- so, I try to -- I try to run on like treadmills or like cushioned track sometimes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  If I -- if -- if I can.  If I can get up to one but, um --
R:  You just don't enjoy it, or you --
L:  If what?
R:  You don't enjoy it or you ?
L:  No I like -- I like it both but the -- the, um, trail on the river is a lot closer.  
R:  And it's pretty --
L:  So, it --
R:  -- and it keeps you entertained too. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, it's really pretty and it's -- yeah, I like it a lot.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I understand that.  We got a lot of trails around here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And --
L:  There aren't that many around here.  Like that's the only one.  So, everyone's on it.  But it's -- it's fun.
R:  [MN] Pretty crowded over there. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [SIGH]
L:  W- where in Texas do you live?
R:  Oh, I live in Fort Worth.
L:  Okay.  I've been to the airport in Dallas, Fort Worth.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, no.
L:  Then -- and I've flown through but I never -- never got -- been out of an airport in Texas.
R:  Yeah?  Oh, I like it.  Texas is --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- quite a contrast.
L:  Is it pretty hot down there?
R:  Um, it's been a little bit milder than usual.  It's about ninety four but it's gonna be ninety nine by the weekend.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, when it -- when it gets really hot do people down there like st- -- like what do the people do for activity down there.  Do they go -- still go outside?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or do people like stick in doors?
R:  Yeah, they have to be more careful and the smart ones go early in the morning or --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- in the evenings where it's, uh, closer to sundown.
L:  Yeah, that's a good idea.
R:  Yeah.  So, yeah, I can -- there's plenty of 'em that still go in the heat of the day but I don't know.  I worry about them[?]. [LAUGH] Gotta be sure that you take plenty of water and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- salt if you're out sweating a lot.
L:  Do you, um -- is there -- it's pretty humid down there, right?
R:  It is here, yeah.  We've got Trinity river and lakes around so it's fairly humid.  Um --
L:  Yeah, that's like -- I hate it when it's humid out here.  Like in the -- if I go running it just --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- gets so hot.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.  I bet -- well, how hot do you consider hot up there?
L:  Um, it gets up in the -- the nineties up here in the summers.
R:  Does it?
L:  It gets -- it can get really hot here but it -- it's probably not as bad as down there.
R:  Oh.  We -- we haven't had a lot of hundred days -- degree days yet but we did have two. [SIGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, we just get used to it and it's -- smart about it and don't -- don't give yourself heatstroke[?].
L:  Yeah, you don't want heatstroke.
R:  Right.  And, um, but the river the Trinity goes all the way [LAUGH] through both Dallas and Forth Worth.  They've got running -- bike and running trails the whole -- the whole way.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  Pretty close the whole way.  So, uh, [SIGH] you know, they've, uh, they've done that recently in the last ten or -- ten years or so and, uh, that's real good for people who enjoy that kinda exercise.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, [LIPSMACK] a lot of people use it.
L:  Good.  Yeah, I'd like -- I'd like to go swimming more but I like to swim in like natural water --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- more than I do in pools but there's nothing you can really swim in [LAUGH] around here.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  R- -- the rivers are all contaminated so 
R:  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah. [inaudible].
L:  That's what I miss about Virginia, where I'm from.  Like you used to go swimming in the river.  It's not dirty.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But not up here. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I'm -- I'm the opposite.  I like swimming pools and mine is ten feet outside my door.  So, [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  Yeah, it is.  It -- it helps.
L:  I live in an apartment so there's no pool in this apartment. [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm in an apartment too but mine has a pool right in front.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I like that. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, that's 
R:  Um, are -- are you still in college or are you finished?
L:  Yeah.  I have one more year at New York University.
R:  Sounds good. [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, I like it a lot.
R:  Yeah, um, big contrast for Virginia?
L:  Um, yeah, it's a lot different.  I lived in -- I lived in Richmond in the city so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  It wasn't like I was on a farm and then moved here but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's definitely different than Richmond.  
R:  Did you take that [MN] -- were you athletic all -- all along or   You know, you said you --
L:  Was I what?
R:  [MN] When did you pick up your exercise routine and all?  Was that part of college or just on your own, or what?
L:  Um, basically I started like, um, the summer after high school and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I don't know.  I was just like big [LAUGH] and inactive and I decided I needed to do something about it.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I -- I started running.  Um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's how I got into it and then I --
R:  [NOISE] Went in weight train- --
L:  The weight training came in.
R:  Yeah.  Uh --
L:  Yeah, I lost like thirty pounds in like two to three months.
R:  Really?
L:  That was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It was pretty fast.
R:  [NOISE] De- defined quite a bit [NOISE] too I imagine.
L:  Do I find what?
R:  Defined your muscles.  Uh, you know, [MN] got yourself all built up. [SIGH] 
L:  Oh, um, like I'm not really, really muscular but, um, more so than I was.
R:  Yeah.
L:  More defined than I was.
R:  Yeah.  Well, my son can really tell the difference when he does it.
