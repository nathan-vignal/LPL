R:  Yeah.  
L:  Oh --
R:  Well, do you exercise regularly?
L:  Yeah, I do actually.
R:  Okay.
L:  We have a, um -- we got tired of paying gym dues and [NOISE] so, um, we have [NOISE], um, [LIPSMACK] a power lifting, uh, gym set in our -- we've made one half of our garage into a gym [NOISE].
R:  Okay.
L:  So, we -- my husband used to be a body builder and so now he's a power lifter and --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- [NOISE] that's what we do. [MN]
R:  [LAUGH] Okay, do you do it willing or ...? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I like to.  I've [NOISE] gotten out of it since my daughter was born.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um -- but I like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I like to do it.  Um, [NOISE] I don't -- I was really into right before she was -- before I got pregnant but then, um, [NOISE] I gain muscle too fast and so it kinda [NOISE] I got -- I -- I bulked up way to fast and I didn't --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- like that.  What about you? [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I -- actually I work out regularly.  I have a, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- gym at my job.
L:  Oh, how convenient. [NOISE]
R:  So, yeah, it actually -- I used to belong to a gym but then I never went 'cause it was inconvenient --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- then I started going to a personal trainer but, like you said, I bulk up easily and I have a, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, a lot of muscle mass so it's -- I -- I started to feel really cocky, you know.
L:  Oh.
R:  And I hated that.
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  Like my arms started getting really big --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, um, so then --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- he really wasn't, you know, letting me -- or making me do any cardio or anything like that it was just lifting weights.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, now I just work out at the gym at my job and do a lot of cardio now and I do some toning.
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  But, um, I'm -- right now I'm trying to get my butt bigger [LAUGH].
L:  Your butt bigger?
R:  Yes.
L:  That's something you don't hear every day. [LAUGH]
R:  Because I have a flat butt. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh okay [LAUGH].  Oh.
R:  So, I'm -- I'm trying to shape it.
L:  [NOISE] Okay.
R:  Yeah.  I shouldn't say bigger I'm just trying to lift and shape. [LAUGH]
L:  Has anyone told you how to do that [NOISE]?
R:  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, everybody tells you how to do it. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, like 'cause [MN] [NOISE] --
R:  I do a lot of squats.
L:  Yeah, that's what does it. [NOISE] Squat and --
R:  Yeah, and I do a lot of kick backs.
L:  -- lunges.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Lunges will do it.  Um, we, uh, I -- I got into teaching aerobics, um, before I got pregnant with my first child --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then so, um, I st- I became, um, what is that, certified [NOISE] for the -- for the fitness stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, we -- we know a lot about that kind of [NOISE] stuff.  You wouldn't know it looking at me now just 'cause I've gotten lazy --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- with my daughter.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I think -- I think that happens when you have your gym in your house.
R:  Yeah.  It --
L:  It's kinda [NOISE] easier to do the dishes than it is to go out and work out [NOISE].
R:  Yeah.  We had one in our house and it -- it -- it soon became --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the clothes rack. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh really?
R:  Yes.  Or -- or that's where the books were put or stuff like that but it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's so convenient to have it at my job --
L:  [NOISE] Oh yeah.
R:  -- 'cause I go right after work or right --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- before work or something.
L:  [NOISE] You know, is it a -- is it like a full fledged gym or is it just --
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  Yeah, and we have, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a nice trail around our -- our gym --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a lot of people go jogging.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  Sometimes I get lunch, I'll walk but --
L:  [NOISE] So, do you do the jogging or anything or ...? [NOISE]
R:  Um, I'd like to jog, I haven't jogged in a while --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- I hate to jog in the winter and right now it's very humid --
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  -- outside.  So, you know, I -- I usually start --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of around September.
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  And jog, you know, for a few months and then, you know, like when it starts getting cold I stop --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then I don't get back in the habit of it again.
L:  [NOISE] So, are you in one of those areas where you have, like, severe climates?  You know, it's really hot or it's really --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, cold.
R:  Not normally but now it has been, like, it's real -- I live in New Jersey --
L:  [NOISE] Oh okay.
R:  -- so it's -- it's been -- you know, we went through --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- where it just rained, it seemed like it rained for thirty days and thirty nights. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Oh my goodness.
R:  But now it's just been --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- extremely humid.
L:  [NOISE] Oh wow.
R:  So -- [MN]
L:  I'm up here in -- up in Washington and it's just --
R:  The state of Washington or Washington DC?
L:  The -- the state [NOISE] of Washington.
R:  Okay.
L:  And it's -- it's perfect outdoorsy weather.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  'Cause even when it's -- I mean, it does rain but even when it is raining it doesn't last very long.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, it's -- it's pretty perfect.
R:  That's nice.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now, you said you're a fitness train- like you -- you're certified?
L:  Yeah, I -- well, I used to be.  I let it go.
R:  What was your best recommendation to get rid of a stomach?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, crunches and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- from all three -- all three [NOISE] -- all three lev- all three sides, so you don't just do, um, the front but you do, um, the sides and you put your hands [NOISE] at different angles --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- which, um, will move your, um, [LIPSMACK] which will move your stomach muscles to different -- it'll -- it'll make them -- you know, it'll make your muscles work at different levels.
R:  So, you mean, like, put 'em at your side or something?
L:  [NOISE] You can put 'em over your head --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, you can put 'em at your side, um, [LIPSMACK] when you -- and then when you do, like, you're side muscles you would, um, you concentrate -- you -- you do it very slow and so you concentrate and you come -- you -- you would come up faster than you would go down.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, [NOISE] that -- that works.  Um, let's see what else.  Um, biking actuall- well, the sit down bikes, like, it's better in gym --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- 'cause they have those sit down bikes.  Those actually help tone up your stomach.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, um, because it's -- it's mainly lower -- um, it works your lower, um, part and you can actually sit in a way that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, you can use your abdominal muscles.
R:  Mhm.  And I never do the bike, like, I always do the elliptical machine or run on the treadmill.
L:  [NOISE] Oh wow, you really do have --
R:  But I never did -- huh?
L:  Yeah, you do have a good gym.
R:  Yeah, we -- y- you know, it's not huge but we have -- you know, we have about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ten, maybe -- yeah, about ten treadmills --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- three elliptical machines and about twelve bikes, a couple of Stairmasters and then we have other -- we have, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and aerobic room --
L:  Oh wow [NOISE].
R:  -- um, actually m- my job is pretty stocked, we have masseuse --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH] -- we have a hair salon --
L:  Oh my gosh!
R:  -- a nail salon at my job. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh my gosh, I think --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I need to just, like, quit where I'm working. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it -- it is actually --
L:  Gee, please.
R:  -- the -- the building --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the building was designed because when it was originally manu- when they originally designed or --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, picked this location --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it was in a lot of farm area.
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  So, you know, it was in -- it wasn't really good, like, for people to go out because it would take too long.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, we have a restaurant, we have a video store --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- car store, the bank -- we have like a lot of things --
L:  Oh, within the building.
R:  -- in the building, yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Oh cool.
R:  But now that they've built up around the town, you know, like, we have a mall now --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's really like five minutes away so --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- but, yeah, it -- it's -- I don't mind, I don't every have to leave my job. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, now do you have to -- is that like part of your perk or ...?  
R:  Um --
L:  I mean, is it part of your job or do you have to pay for that?
R:  Yeah, we have to pay for it but it's like three dollars each pay period.
L:  Oh my gosh!
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's cheap.
R:  So, it's like six dollars a month.
L:  Wow. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  And they have a personal --
L:  Well, you got it made.
R:  -- trainer there.
L:  Oh my gosh, you got it made.
R:  Yeah.  It -- it's nice.  A lot of people don't take advantage of it though.
L:  Oh, that's too bad [NOISE].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, my husband [NOISE] tries to do the whole personal trainer thing with me and then -- but he's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- he's too nice when it comes to me.
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  He doesn't push me and so if I say, I say, "Ow" he's like, "Oh okay, well how about we just stop".
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  I'm like, "No, I need that push, I need that push" [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  That is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that -- you know what, that is so important sometimes it's hard --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to even work out by yourself because you can -- you know, okay, I'll only do three --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and you don't have anybody there to say, "Okay, no, do one more, do one more".
L:  [NOISE] Exactly, exactly.
R:  So --
L:  I [NOISE] used to work out wit my best friend and I used to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like, literally hate [NOISE] going and working out with her [NOISE].  Ju- --
R:  Those are some of the best workouts though.
L:  Yeah, just -- just because you -- you'd leave there and you're like, "Oh, I'm kinda kill you".
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] I hurt so much. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I had a friend that just entered a body building con- --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or, yeah, a body building contest.
L:  [NOISE] Really?
R:  Yeah, and, um, she really -- she really trained really, really hard and I -- I just remember, like, the month leading up to it she couldn't -- we couldn't go out anymore, we couldn't hang out 'cause she couldn't drink, she couldn't eat --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- certain things and it was just really hard.  But she really looked amazing.
L:  Wow.
R:  But she doesn't train that hard anymore. [NOISE]
L:  Wow.
R:  But, um, please I wish I was in that kind of shape. [LAUGH]
L:  I know, I hear ya.
R:  Ye- yeah.
L:  I hear ya, I'm still trying to lose the -- well, I shouldn't say lose --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'm trying to tighten up from my daughter so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But hopefully -- hopefully it'll go away.  She's still baby so I'm -- I think I'm okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, that's good.
L:  Yeah.  So, do you do anything else for health and fitness or, I mean, do you eat -- eat right?
R:  Um, yeah, I try to eat right, uh, you know, it doesn't always work.  I don't eat a lot of junk food but I miss a lot of meals.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, you know, I can go ...
