R:  Hi, this is Nicola.
L:  Hi, this is Richard.  How are you?
R:  Hi, Richard.  I'm fine.  Whereabouts --
L:  Uh --
R:  Whereabouts are you?
L:  Uh, right now I'm in, uh, Florida.
R:  In Florida?
L:  Yeah.
R:  All right.  That's a pretty healthy place to be, isn't it?
L:  Oh, yeah.  It's kinda hot when it's, uh, nice and sunny.  What about you?  But where might you be?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Well, I guess --
L:  Where are you?
R:  I'm in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  In Dallas, Texas.
L:  Dallas, Texas?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, that's cool.  That's just [inaudible].  I've been there many times.
R:  Yeah.  Where it's really just too hot to go outside, so  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, it's probably -- probably over a hundred out in Dallas now.
R:  It's getting there, yeah.  It really is.  It's very warm.  So, I guess the subject today is exercise and health and fitness.
L:  Okay.  Uh, tell me what you do for exercise.  
R:  Well, I recently joined a health club actually and I just had a meeting with a personal trainer recently to assess my -- my, um, fitness level or lack thereof and to develop a fitness plan for me.  So, [LIPSMACK] I'm kind of excited.  I actually haven't started doing it yet but I'm enthusiastic about it.  How about you, Richard?
L:  [MN] Well, me, I have a, uh, self, uh, designed program.  I do a lot of scuba diving and, uh, swimming and, uh, I cycle and, uh, I -- I don't do much, uh, roller skating any more.  I used to roller skate quite a bit but I just basically limit myself now to, uh, swimming, scuba diving and, uh, I jog some.  And the hot weather's coming curtail my jogging a little bit.  It's just kinda tough if you're gonna jog in a hundred degrees.
R:  It is hot, yeah.
L:  And, uh --
R:  It takes a lot out of you.
L:  And then I have some, uh, exercise equipment in my basement that I work out on.
R:  You do?
L:  And mainly I use NordicTrack.  I say I'm of the old school.  I like NordicTrack.
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  And, uh, you get a pretty good workout on NordicTrack.  I try to spend about, uh, three times a week about twenty to twenty five minutes on NordicTrack.
R:  Oh, that's a lot.
L:  And, uh, that's, uh, it keeps [several inaudible words].
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's good for your -- good for your calf muscles in your legs and then also your lower back and it's great exercise, yeah, for your lower back.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, your upper torso.  And, uh, don't do a whole lot of, you know, it's supposed to -- the advertising is, you know, is real good, uh, release for the, you know, what you call the spare tire syndrome.  But, uh, it don't do a whole lot of good on that part of it.
R:  [LAUGH] Just on the general toning.
L:  Yeah.  Basically I found the best thing to do on the -- the tone [inaudible] of your, you know, midriff area was weight setup and pushups.  You know, that's where I -- wound[?] up tired.  I get a little bit lazy and start to get a little bit flabby around the middle then I start doing pushups and, uh, then usually I cycle quite a bit.  That'll -- that'll [inaudible] take you back down.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh --
R:  Well, you can't be too unhealthy if you're spending a lot of time in the water.
L:  Yeah, sound like you have an English accent.
R:  I do.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, what part are you from?
R:  I'm from Yorkshire up in the north east of England.
L:  Yeah, Yorkshire.  I've been -- I've been to Europe and, uh, England several times.
R:  You have?
L:  Yeah.  I've never been to Yorkshire but I've been through, uh, Liverpool and London and I've been all over Scotland, Inver- -- Inverness, Edinburgh.  You know.  I really do.  I really like the Scottish people.  They were --
R:  Oh, yeah, they're lovely.  I have a Scottish brother in law.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I have a hard time understanding them.
R:  [LAUGH] I bet they --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- had a hard time understanding you. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I'm sure. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, um, but I, uh, I had a -- you know, sometimes it's almost like they're speaking a foreign language.  You have to really listen close.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, like I had a gentleman tell me one day in, uh -- I was in Inverness and, uh, was talking with a gentleman and he says, uh, "My God".  He said, "You know, we speak English.  What the hell are you guys speaking?"
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And I thought -- I thought look here buddy I said, "I was wondering the same thing about you guys".
R:  Oh, that's --
L:  But, um, I enjoy, uh, I enjoy walking a lot.  I've done a lot of walking.  I love to, uh, walk in the mornings.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I do a lot of trail, you know, do a lot of trail, um, backpacking and, uh --
R:  And do you have access to that in Florida?
L:  Uh, well actually I'm not from -- I'm just in Florida visiting.  I'm actually from the Atlanta area.
R:  Oh, okay.  Oh, in the --
L:  We live out in the, uh, western suburbs of Atlanta.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, we have a, uh, trail that runs forty six miles.  It's called the silver comet trail.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it's strictly only for cycling and, uh, at one time it was -- it was [inaudible] off of railroads that went from, uh, about forty -- around about forty six miles and the railroad, uh, they -- they done away with the track so the municipal government bought the land and the state federal [inaudible] bought the land and they turned it into a, uh, the trail.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it's all paved and, uh, we get -- you can only cycle.  There's no motorized vehicles whatsoever.  You can cycle it or you can walk.
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  And, um --
R:  They're doing something similar to that in Dallas on one of the trails [NOISE] that used to be an old railroad.
L:  But it's -- it's a very, you know, very scenic.  A lot of wildlife.  You see a lot of deer and, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's, uh, you know, it's good exercise.  It's not -- it's not really hilly.  The hills that you come upon are gradual grades.  They're not any real steep drop off.  'Cause it was at once a, uh, river track.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh --
R:  Well, that's beautiful.  It makes it so much easier when you're working out if you're out somewhere in a really nice environment, doesn't it?
L:  Well, I tell you, you know, it makes the, uh, exercise cycle go through a lot quicker because, you know, it gets kinda boring, you know, the NordicTrack with a headset on.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, listening to a tape.  When you're out walking, you know, you could get you a good fast pace and, uh, and I travel quite a bit in my job and, uh, in fact I travel extensively in my job and, uh, I work out -- try to work out in motels where they have workout centers and every one I go to they always have a pool and I -- I swim in the morning.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I come back to my room and I swim about, you know, twenty or thirty minutes in the afternoons and, uh, just gotta keep myself in shape, uh --
R:  That's very --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- disciplined because especially if you travel it can be really difficult to --
L:  It is, you know --
R:  -- to exercise.
L:  -- sometimes you're -- sometimes you get into the, uh, syndrome that you're just, uh, you're tired.  You don't feel like doing anything and I know at several occasions I have to just basically push myself out of the room.
R:  Yeah.
L:  All I wanna do when I come back down   'Cause a lot of places that I go into they're, uh, they're manufacturing plants and they're hot, you know, and, you know, and you really perspire in these places.  It takes a lot out of you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then when you get back to your room you just basically wanna go out and find a cool place to lay down but I u- -- always [inaudible] lay and rest a few minutes.  Then I put on my swim trunks and go down and, you know, usually start a, you know, swim about thirty or forty five minutes in the afternoons and it, uh, basically after dinner 'cause it makes you sleep a lot better.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [several inaudible words] and get you a, you know, good, you know, cool shower and then, uh, I used, you know, just sleep like a baby, you know.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Then it doesn't matter if you have all kind of strange room noise in your hotel room, huh?
L:  Well, [LAUGH] I don't hear 'em.  Honest to God I -- I go to sleep I mean I really go to sleep.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I sleep sound.  I'm a -- I'm a good sound sleeper.  When I -- when I take advantage of my eight hours, nine hours sleep.  You know, I -- I -- I don't wake up hardly ever during the night time.
R:  Wow.
L:  And, uh, yeah, when I sleep I'd normally wake up, you know, with the alarm time that goes off and, uh, 'cause I have, you know, appointments I have to keep in the mornings so I have to pretty prompt.  But, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause I work for a company that, uh, you know, we, uh, we have places out in, uh   In fact we have a place in Arlington, Texas.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  I was just out there just about a month ago.  Uh, called TerraStar Corporation.
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  It's called TerraStar Industries and, uh, that's who I work for.
R:  Oh, right.
L:  And, uh, I travel around and I'm in industrial safety.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  A transportation specialist engineer and, uh, I go out and if we have plants that are -- are, uh, you know, not up to par 'cause they have a lot of accidents, a lot of incidents and damages. [inaudible] I go in and set up exercise programs.  You know, looked at most of our plants that I go into before the shift starts if we have a, uh, stretching exercises.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  And since we -- since we instituted this program about a year ago our claims for strained muscles and, uh, you know, on workers' comp claims dropped about thirty five or forty percent.
R:  That's excellent.
L:  Just with these stretch exercises and, um --
R:  That's a real accomplishment, isn't it?
L:  And the guys, you know, they -- they make fun of it.  You know, they make fun.  I says, you know, they, uh, you know, they make all these weird sounds [inaudible].  You got fifteen, twenty guys out and you're exercising and showing them do some stretches that --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- will alleviate some of the strain on them, and some of the [inaudible] on them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, and they wanna make -- they wanna make fun of it but I said, you know, in the long run I said it's gonna help you guys.  You know, I'm the guy that's gonna help you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, I told 'em I said -- I said, "Look, I'm fifty eight years old", and I said, "I bet you there's probably not one of you guys in here that could out run me".
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, they look at me and they said, "You're fifty eight years old?"  I says, "Yes, I am".  And this is guys when [several inaudible words] over probably early forties they said, "You're kidding?"  I says, "No, I'm fifty eight years old".  And, uh --
R:  So then they decided to follow your exercise routine, huh? [LAUGH] 
L:  That's the -- you know, I said I -- I basically contribute my, you know, my youthful look to probably exercising.  I've always exercised.  I've always been on exercise programs and I'm always living outdoors.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And --
R:  Were you in athletics programs when you were in school?
L:  Uh, yes I did.  I played football --
R:  'Cause that definitely starts it, doesn't it?
L:  And I -- I played baseball.  I was a double letter man.  I w- -- I wasn't quite -- I managed -- well, I had a bad knee and it was kinda rough on me playing basketball.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, uh, 'cause you have to [several inaudible words] and come down on your knee and I had a knee injury when I was quite young and, uh, so I didn't -- I wa- -- I did not go out for basketball 'cause it was, you know, really tough on -- on your knees.  And I did play some football and I double lettered[?] in, uh, high school and   But, uh --
R:  That's great.  That obviously set you up for a very healthy lifestyle all the way down.
L:  Yeah, I think, you know, my doctor he, uh, he says, "You know, if you continue your lifestyle and you [inaudible]" -- I don't drink.  See I only drink coffee in the morning.  I let myself two cups of coffee in the morning to drink.  No soda whatsoever.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I only drink fruit juice; orange juice, grapefruit juice are my two favorites.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, and I always [several inaudible words] stop and have a Big Mac and, uh, I always try to go to a place where I can get a, you know, get fruit and, uh, maybe have a salad.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Something in that line and, uh, try to stay pretty well, you know, stay in shape and, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I have a -- yeah, I wear a light beard and my hair's just totally dark and that's what -- that's what throws
