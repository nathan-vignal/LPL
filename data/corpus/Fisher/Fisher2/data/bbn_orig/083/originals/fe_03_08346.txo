R:  My name is Sydney Miller.
L:  This is Laura.
R:  Laura?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Nice to talk to you, how are you?
L:  Fine.
R:  So, do you exercise regularly for health and fitness?
L:  Um, I try too [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] How often?
L:  [NOISE] Um, I'm trying to go running every morning but doesn't always work out. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh really?  Like before work or school or whatever?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Wow, that's really dedicated.  I don't think I could, uh, necessarily do that.  The only exercise that I really get is I, um -- where I have to park and where I walk to my job is about a mile so, like, two miles a day walking back and forth.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But that's about all. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I used to, uh, go to yoga every morning kinda -- I guess, kinda like you do the running thing, like, I'd go to yoga in the morning before I went to school but, um, that kinda ended after a while, I got tired of getting up at six o'clock in the morning.
L:  And now I'm gonna do training for lifeguard so I have to go swim every morning. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, are you serious?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Wow, for how long?
L:  Um, like an hour.
R:  Like an hour?
L:  Mhm.
R:  What time do you have to get up to go running?
L:  Five thirty.
R:  Five thirty?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Wow.  How do you -- like, you do have to go to work or something after that? [NOISE]
L:  Um, school.
R:  Oh, school.  So, you -- so you just like go running and then like take a shower and go to school?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh wow.  Do you think you get enough exercise?
L:  Do I what?
R:  Do you think that you get enough exercise or do you wish you got more?
L:  I wanna do more weight stuff.
R:  Oh, yeah.  That's true.
L:  I do some but not that much.
R:  When I was in college I did weights like once in a while, you know, when I felt really guilty 'cause I'd eaten something bad, you know [LAUGH], like, oh eaten too much chocolate cake better go and do weights the next day but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's kinda hard if you don't have a membership to the gym.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, to just be like, "Oh yeah" 'cause I'll go lift like cas[?] or something.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um [NOISE], how long have you been running regularly?
L:  Just about two weeks. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, not like years and years or anything?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, um, you know, I wish I got more exercise but unfortunately it's kinda like a lack of time and lack of money to, you know, like pay to go to organized exercise and I'm too lazy [NOISE] to do it on my own.  It's kinda hard to, like, force yourself --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to exercise in your own home when you're like, "Oh, I could just sit down on the couch and watch a movie" [NOISE] so that's kinda hard.
L:  [NOISE] I saw this Pilates thing on TV and it works like really good [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I heard somebody talking about that today actually.
L:  Like I just did it like one night and I, like, felt it, like, all over and like, "Ooh, that feels good" [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Is it like -- is it stretching or is it more like using your body as a weight or what?
L:  Kinda both.
R:  Oh.  Isn't that supposed to be really good for your legs?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  'Cause I kinda have big thighs so I was trying to do that.
R:  I've never met anyone who didn't say the same thing. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Everyone thinks they have big thighs.
L:  But mine, uh, they are. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But, um, I don't like --
L:  It runs in the family though so -- [LAUGH]
R:  I would like to do those exercise tapes but I think I'd get bored doing the same workout over and over and over.
L:  And you don't know which ones work and which ones don't. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I imagine anything that you [NOISE] -- like if you [NOISE] do any kind of real exercise for, like, half an hour it's gonna work.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, that's why they all -- like, they all have these advertisements, "Oh, if you do our program everyday for just forty five minutes, you'll look better in six weeks" if you do anything for forty five minutes a day for six weeks you're gonna look really good. [LAUGH] Or at some -- you know, look a little bit better.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, like, I guess it's kinda the way to sell it that way.  But I think I'd get tired of doing the same, like, the same tape over and over.
L:  [NOISE] I know.  Like, you already know what's coming up and you're like, "I want something new". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, and you're like, "Oh, this is the part I hate, I gotta go get some water".  You know, they have that thing on TV, um, where Denise Austin does, like, a different workout every day on TV on, like, Lifetime or something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I'd like to do that but unfortunately I don't have cable so it's kinda hard to --
L:  I do. [LAUGH]
R:  You do?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, you can watch her and do her -- you know, she has a couple -- I think at like seven thirty and then ten thirty too.  I don't know, I just guess it's [MN] --
L:  I'm at school at seven thirty.
R:  Oh, you can tape it.
L:  I leave here at, like, seven thirty to get there for eight.
R:  Are you in college or ...?
L:  I'm in high school.
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] I thought you sounded young, I was just kinda wondering.  But, yeah --
L:  So, I'm doing summer school right now. [LAUGH]
R:  Do you do sports at school?  Do you, like, exercise there? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Swimming?
L:  Um, I've never actually done swimming but I'm gonna try this summer.  I wanna do diving, like do that. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  And I do tennis.
R:  Tennis.  That's supposed to be a pretty good workout.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess, mostly chasing those balls around.
L:  I did it in junior high and stuff.
R:  Do you think that what you eat -- like, do you think that you can lose weight by either just fitness or -- like, do you think you can eat whatever you want but if you exercise and actually lose weight or vice versa, like, not exercise at all but eat really healthy and lose weight?
L:  Yeah, like -- like playing softball and stuff I still ate, like, just whatever and I didn't lose nothing. [LAUGH] But then I started eating, like, vegetables and stuff --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like, carrots instead of chips --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- and then I started to.
R:  [NOISE] I think exercise has something to do with it.  Like, you can lose weight by just eating healthy food but you can't really get like toned up.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, you're not gonna be like all firm and well shaped whatever, you'll just be kinda bony.  But if you do both, I think, you'll lose quite a bit of weight and, like, look healthier --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and stuff.
L:  Yeah, and all these people that say like, exercise doesn't work for them and stuff, they don't give it enough time really [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, really, like, I exercised once and I didn't seem to lose any weight. [MN] Like, it takes a little more than that.  But it's so hard, like, I feel like [MN] maybe it's just an excuse or maybe it really is the reason why I don't exercise but I just -- like, I don't have enough time, you know, like, I get up at, like, eight and I go to work and then I go to class and then I come home at, like, five thirty --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then I do my homework and then I go to sleep and then, you know, it's like a repeating cycle so when I used to exercise in there -- 'cause not only you have to exercise you have to, like, put on the gym clothes --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and go to the gym and take a shower and get cleaned up back up and then go whatever else you're gonna do with your life.  It takes, like, at least an hour and a half.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's so time consuming.
L:  Takes about half an hour to actually get me out of bed to go running. [LAUGH]
R:  Mm [LAUGH].
L:  Like, "I'm so tired, I don't wanna go". [NOISE]
R:  And that -- that's amazing though that you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- go running every day.  I used to take long walks a lot.  Like, not -- not for like fun but just for, like, exercise purposes.  But unfortunately that doesn't really happen anymore.  I know a lot of people ride their bikes to school.
L:  Yeah, we go on bike rides sometimes.  Like, we're going to the mountains Friday so we'll probably even take our bikes.  Go ride round up there.
R:  Yeah, that's always fun but it's like it's actually getting that regular exercise it's kind hard.
L:  It used to be good in the mountains, like, I'd be able to go uphills and everything, I'm not that good anymore. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And whenever my sister comes home from her work, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I get her up to go running and stuff 'cause she's in track and they're doing track right now so when she's goes back to college--
R:  Oh wow.
L:  -- she has to get some -- she has to go [inaudible], you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  She had pole vaulting.
R:  What do you think is the reason that most people don't exercise regularly?
L:  Mm, [LIPSMACK] they just think about time and stuff, they don't feel like getting up at five thirty in the morning [LAUGH].
R:  And that much is true.
L:  And, like, sometimes after doing that, you know, like it hurts for a while, you know.  And like playing --
R:  I always kinda liked that part.  But --
L:  -- playing tennis kinda hurt. [MN]
R:  Your [NOISE] knees or your elbow or ...?
L:  Yeah, I hurt a knee playing it.
R:  I don't see how people can play volleyball, it just look like it really hurt your hands.
L:  That hurt [LAUGH].
R:  Like, especially on a regular -- like once in a while, I guess, it's not bad but if you play that all the time that would be really painful.
L:  Yeah, we played it -- like, I tried to play it, you know, and you had to keep hitting on your forearm and it hurt so much my arm's like all red and everything. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, I don't know how you guys do this. [LAUGH]
R:  Even -- I see people who, like -- who are on, like, a sport- like one or two sports teams and they run all the time and they're always practising for their sport and always going to games so, like, they're exercising constantly and I kinda wonder, like, how they have time to do anything else.  But, um, I also kind of think, like -- I see them eating and they just eat whatever they want.  Like, they're eat --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  --  like two hamburgers, this is like girls, it's not like they're real big guys or anything.  They'll eat, like, a couple of hamburgers and a big plate of fries and, like, a big soda and ice cream and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they don't ever get fat.
L:  Here you are with your little sandwich. [LAUGH]
R:  Huh?
L:  And there you are with your little sandwich saying, "How can you eat this stuff?"
R:  Yeah, e- exactly.  If I exercised every day I probably could eat that stuff but, you know --
L:  I don't think, like, during the school year, like, when ...
