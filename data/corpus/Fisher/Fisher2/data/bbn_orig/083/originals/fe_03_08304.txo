R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  My name is Bob.
L:  This is Alice.
R:  Alice?
L:  Right.
R:  How are you, Alice?
L:  Fine, and yourself?
R:  Just fine.
L:  That's good.  Have you done this survey before?
R:  I've done it before.
L:  You have?  How -- how does --
R:  Have you?
L:  No, this is the first time.
R:  Um, we just talk for ten minutes on the subject.
L:  Okay.  Uh, what was that again?
R:  The subject?
L:  Right.
R:  Should -- I think it was should private schools regulate their students learning?
L:  Okay.  What -- what do you think about it?
R:  Well, the student supposedly can pick whatever school they want to go to.  If they don't want to learn what the school wants them to learn, then they'll just go to another school.
L:  Uh, [LAUGH] I don't -- I -- I really haven't thought about this.  Um, the subject was whether or not the students can pick their own school.  Is that right?
R:  No, it was --
L:  Oh, I'm sorry.
R:  -- whether schools should regulate what students learn.
L:  Oh, regulate what students learn.  Oh, I think so.  Of course.  Uh, they get the basics of each subject so ...
R:  What?
L:  That the students learn basics of each subject and that way they can go ahead and --
R:  Well, in science they would learn evolution probably.
L:  Evolution?
R:  And I'm pretty sure in math they would learn algebra and geometry and calculus and all that.
L:  Right.
R:  In chem -- and in, uh, chemistry they would learn the tables and all.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, uh, in government and religion and things like that, they learn either a liberal or a conservative viewpoint.
L:  Right.
R:  Then it's up to the school to determine what they learn.  Maybe they learn both sides I don't know.  It's been a while since I've been in school.
L:  Right [LAUGH].  I think they basically teach a little bit of each, that way they can decide whether it's -- um, really ten minute-- [LAUGH].  Um, do you have any children?  Are they in school?
R:  No.
L:  No.
R:  Do you?
L:  Yeah.  Uh --
R:  What's -- what grade are they in?
L:  My oldest is in -- he's just turned into the tenth grade and the youngest went to seventh grade.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Are they in private schools?
L:  No, they're in public school.
R:  Uh --
L:  So, they get a little bit of everything.  Um --
R:  Do the English teachers pick what they're supposed to read in the summer time?
L:  They have a recommended list, yes and then --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they go ahead and test about that afterwards when -- when school starts.
R:  Are you -- do you approve of it?
L:  Um, the books?  Yeah, they're -- they're mostly classics, a lot -- some classics and, um, they're interesting books.  I think they should get a little bit of everything as long as it's nothing out there but usually it isn't [NOISE].  Um, Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, I'm sorry.  It sounded like you were hanging up.
R:  No, I'm not hanging up.  I'm here for the full time.
L:  Oh, okay.  Oh, what else? [NOISE]
R:  We don't put in our time, we don't get paid.
L:  Right [LAUGH].  I'm --
R:  It's not that bigger deal to talk for ten minutes.
L:  Excuse me?
R:  I say it's not that bigger deal to talk for ten minutes.
L:  Uh-huh.  Right, I agree.  How -- how many times have you done this survey?
R:  This is my second time.
L:  Second time?  And how did you find out about it?
R:  Please?
L:  How did you find out about it?
R:  Um, on -- on the Internet.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  How did you find out?
L:  One of my friends let me know [NOISE].
R:  Oh.
L:  She -- she was doing so she told me to give it a try.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.  Where did you go to school? [NOISE]
R:  Um, I went -- I went to high school, uh, college and high school and I went, uh -- I got a BS, BA and a MBA.
L:  Oh, okay.  That's a lot of education.
R:  Yeah.  I've had educational experience.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They're all from different schools, all my degrees, every one of them.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's good.  You have some experience --
R:  What's your education?
L:  I haven't finished college yet.
R:  Oh, you're in college?
L:  Yeah, I'm going slowly but I'm hanging in there [NOISE].
R:  You go to night school?
L:  Excuse me?
R:  Do you go to night school?
L:  No, I'm going to -- during the day.
R:  Oh, are you?
L:  Right.  Almost done.
R:  What are you studying?
L:  Education, secondary.
R:  Secondary education.
L:  Right.
R:  Did you -- do your professors have certain views on how to teach school that you find or you don't approve -- don't agree with or do you agree with everything they say?
L:  So far I -- I've -- I've agreed with everything only because I think they're following the law so, you know, it's -- it's what everybody votes for basically so I -- I --
R:  It's what -- it's what?
L:  It's -- you know, the people are voting for the -- the system itself and so far I agree with it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What about reading?
L:  Reading?  Yeah, I -- I mean, there's not too many censor- there's not so much censorship over here [NOISE] so, I -- I'm okay with it.
R:  Do they have phon- phonetics or -- or what's the word, phonetics and what's the other kind of reading?
L:  No, no.
R:  You don't read by phonetics.  There's some other way.  By the -- by the sound of the words or by the thoughts of the words.
L:  By the what of the words?
R:  I know in California they tried phonetics so --
L:  Like [inaudible]
R:  Please?
L:  Are you -- are you talking like [inaudible] [NOISE]?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.  Not here, not here.
R:  Oh.
L:  That doesn't happen here [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  [NOISE] I don't think there's much demand for that.
R:  I don't know much about teaching.
L:  Excuse me.
R:  I don't much about teaching when -- I know -- I know there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- was a big controversy on how to teach reading.
L:  Yeah, I heard about that.
R:  And some schools teach one way and some schools teach the other way.
L:  Well, I -- I know here I think it's supposed to be a set curriculum so everybody --
R:  Please?
L:  Excuse me?
R:  Please?
L:  Everybody has to follow a certain curriculum over here.  Ev- everybody's pretty much keeping the same thing.
R:  Do you have proof of that?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Where are you from?
L:  Texas.
R:  Texas.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, that's -- George Bush introduced that, didn't he?
L:  Excuse me?
R:  Didn't Governor Bush introduce that?
L:  I'm not sure who introduced it but it's in place [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I understand the Texas school system's doing pretty good.
L:  It could be better but, yeah, it's -- it's okay.
R:  Do you have a -- a lot of people that are immigrants --
L:  Here it's --
R:  -- in the public schools in Texas?
L:  -- it's mostly from Mexico.
R:  From Mexico, yeah.
L:  Mostly.
R:  They're mostly from Mexico.
L:  Uh-huh [NOISE].  That I've seen.
R:  Is that --
L:  Excuse me?
R:  Please.
L:  No, uh, mainly from Mexico.  There's -- there seems to be a few Filipinos.
R:  Filipinos?
L:  Right.
R:  I'll be darned.
L:  Right.
R:  You have a lot of immigrants in Texas then.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [COUGH] America is growing because of immigrants not because of -- I mean, our explosion in the birth population.
L:  Right, right.  
R:  And that's necessary for the country to grow.
L:  Right, I agree.
R:  I think America's one of the most ...
