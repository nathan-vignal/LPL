L:  [SIGH]  Hi, I'm Jewell.
R:  Hi, I'm Terry.  [PAUSE]  How are you?  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Good.  How are you?  [NOISE]
R:  Good.
L:  Where are you?
R:  Rhode Island.  Where are you?  [SIGH]
L:  I'm in New York City.
R:  [LAUGH]  Is this the first call you've ever done?
L:  [SIGH]  No, this is actually my last one.  It's my t- third one.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, mine ...
L:  U- um, and it -- it's been pretty good.  It's a -- a good thing to do.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I -- I've met some people where [SIGH] you get talking so fast at the end 'cause you h- have so many things to say, and they're gonna hang up on you.  [LAUGH]
L:  Real- -- I --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I thought a lot of conversations before were, like, [SIGH] um, I'm really in -- I actually talked to one girl once from -- who was -- l- lived in New York City, [MN] and we were just talking about so much that we were worried that, you know, like, you're gonna run -- [SIGH] you've never going to talk to each other again, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's a good thing.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, anyway this -- ah, this t- topic is really funny for me.  Um, 'cause it's health and fitness and I'm actually a professional [SIGH] fitness instructor.  [LAUGH]
R:  Wow!
L:  [SIGH]  So, it's pretty, -- [SIGH] like, I -- I -- n- normally I get, like, you know, you get the [NOISE] p- prompt from the -- whatever all the time and, um, [LIPSMACK] a lot of times I just, like, ignore it or don't answer it, [SIGH] but when they said the topic was health and fitness I'm like, "Oh, I could talk for hours about health and fitness".  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  It's a good t- [LAUGH] topic for me.  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  So, what do --
L:  But --
R:  -- you teach?
L:  Um, I teach aerobics.
R:  Wow!  At --
L:  And I'm a personal trainer as well.  So, [SIGH] I pretty much work out every day for money.  [LAUGH]
R:  Wow!
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, how --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- about you?
R:  Oh, I'm -- I'm in the opposite.  [LAUGH]
L:  Y- yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  Yes, I'm very bad when it comes to health and fi- -- fit, um, [SIGH] --
L:  Oh!   [LAUGH]
R:  -- fitness.  But --
L:  [SIGH]  What do you do for a living?
R:  Um, mystery shopping and merchandising.
L:  Really!  That's very interesting.
R:  It's fun.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Wow!
R:  It gets --
L:  So, like, you go into stores and stuff and, ah, [SIGH] [PAUSE] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- check it out?  [NOISE]
R:  And they just really want to know if they're -- they're friendly and they say, "Hi" and they answer the questions r- right and [SIGH] ... I worked in ret- -- um, retail when I was a kid.  So, it was, like, I know what it's like.  Customers --
L:  Right.
R:  -- are mean people.  They -- they're just a rare being, customers.
L:  [MN]
R:  So, [SIGH] I -- I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I've never given anybody a bad report.
L:  Right.
R:  That's pretty ridiculous.
L:  Oh, that's -- that's nice of you.  How do you, um, get into, like, [SIGH] t- t- that --
R:  Ah --
L:  -- aspect of it, like, did you meet someone or did the job --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- come up or whatever?
R:  No, I met -- I got it on the Internet.
L:  [NOISE]  Wow!
R:  You -- you go to Volition, V.O.L.I.T.I.O.N. dot com.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And then you click on "Get Paid to Shop" ... a- and then you click on "Mystery Shopping" and it's all in there.  [PAUSE]
L:  And t- that works out paid pretty well?
R:  Oh, I love it.  [SIGH]  We go out to --
L:  Right.
R:  -- we go out to, like, Bubblebrook[?] Creek and Long Horn and [SIGH] the Gristmill.  Really nice restaurants too.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH] um, ...
L:  Good stuff.
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  Um, --
R:  -- and we're going on a -- um, resort shop where you go away for a three day vacation in, um, the Berkshires -- through it.
L:  [LAUGH]  Oh, that's n- [LAUGH] nice!
R:  Yeah, all free.  It -- it's, ah, y- you [SIGH] -- it's [SIGH] -- you can -- you -- well you go to the site and there's, like, a hundred companies [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- ah, from A to Z and you just read t- the descriptions and then you fill, like, a -- a one page application.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh!
R:  And then they start to send you e- emails of all the stuff that you can do.
L:  [SIGH]  Wow!
R:  [SIGH]  And you can just pick and choose.  If it happens --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- to be right down the s- street, [SIGH] you know, --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- you can take it or if there's, like, five of 'em in -- in one place you could, you know, take it, do that.  [SIGH]  We're going -- we go to the movies, like, three times a month for free.  [SIGH]  We just saw Legally Blonde and, um, Charl- -- the new Charlies Angels.  That was good.
L:  Oh, how ... were they?
R:  They were great.
L:  Those are both two movies I want to see.
R:  Oh, yeah, they were both g- great, great --
L:  [LAUGH]
R: -- great, great.  [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Um, and what was that web site again?  [SIGH]
R:  Volition, V.O.L.I.T.I.O.N.
L:  Volition?
R:  Yep.
L:  Wow!
R:  [SIGH]  So, go there, click on to, "Get Paid to Shop" [SIGH] and then click on "M- Mystery Shopping" and they'll --
L:  You've done really well.  That sounds very interesting.
R:  And then there's a message board in there.  And that's actually my home page on my computer, [SIGH] because --
L:  Really?
R:  -- the m- message board is where all these schedulers post the jobs.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  And -- and that's how I got the -- the resort shops.  [PAUSE]  So, I get, like, seventy five dollars for writing the r- report and a three day vacation [SIGH] to go --
L:  [MN]  N- n- nice.  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, to do a report on the -- the time share presentation.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  You know what's so great is that, [NOISE] um, there's so many, like, little secret shops out there that are just ... [NOISE] you know, the perks are great, [SIGH] the whole thing is great, you know.  You just have to ... find out where they are, [NOISE] you know?
R:  Yep.
L:  That kind of thing where it's, like, -- it's a little secret hidden somewhere and, [SIGH] you know, hopefully if you're lucky you run into it somewhere.  So, ...
R:  Yeah.  The ones that I think are -- um, certified, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] it's C.R.I.N.Y. dot com.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They do the movies.  [NOISE]  And Market Ad- -- [SIGH] Market Advantage does the resort shops.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]  Focus on Service does the restaurant shops.  [NOISE]  [PAUSE]  And Shop and Check, u- um, is just all around great ... for all different things.
L:  [NOISE]  Shop and Check?
R:  Yep.
L:  C- c- cool!  [NOISE]
R:  All the addresses will be in there.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  When you go into that Volition site.  [SIGH]  They'll -- there's a place where it says, "Mystery Shoppers [SIGH] Shopping Companies A to Z".
L:  Yeah.
R:  And you just click on that.  [SIGH]  And you'll see -- you -- as you go through the list you'll see those names.
L:  Cool!
R:  [SIGH]  So, you can get the links in there.
L:  [NOISE]  Cool!
R:  But those are the four best and I've applied to, like, thirty two of them.  [SIGH]
L:  Um.
R:  'Cause you just apply --
L:  And you --
R:  -- apply, apply, apply and you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- get emails and then you pick and choose, and you decide who you like.  [SIGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Right.  Do you do that mostly full time?  [SIGH]
R:  Well, the merchandising I -- I [SIGH] -- I -- I got on a l- lark.  I -- I -- I went to do a demo, -- like, a four hour demo in a pet store.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, ah, the guy that was interviewing me says, "Oh, would you like to do this permanent part time thing where you go to a store a couple -- [SIGH] couple of times a -- a month for two hours and --"
L:  Mm.
R:  "-- [SIGH] check off this list?  You know, is everything fine, type deal?"  [SIGH]  I'm like, "Okay".
L:  [SIGH]
R:  And all of a sudden I've got twenty one stores from them.
L:  Wow!
R:  Yeah, all the way from, like, Cape Cod to Newport [SIGH] to, um, Aldborough to ... Rhode Island.  And [SIGH] ... it's fun, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- it's great.  You know, people -- they're out of C- Colorado and [SIGH] they f- fly in to train you or meet with you or have conference calls and, [SIGH] you know, there's people working all over the country for these, um, -- for this outfit.  [SIGH]  And it's kind of neat the networking they do and --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and it -- it's a p- positive com- company [SIGH] and they're growing.  So, [SIGH] I don't know I went to apply for a four hour demo job where I gave out dog food coupons and all of a sudden I'm -- I have twenty one stores.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]  I -- I still don't know how it h- happened.  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  But I have no time for myself anymore.  None.
L:  [SIGH]  Really?
R:  Because it's addictive.  I've got those twenty one stores but then I keep going -- doing the mystery shopping.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  'Cause I'm like, "Hey, if I have to go [SIGH] do a Petsmart and, ah, Petco and Aloes up in -- in, like, Aldborough, or something --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] why don't I throw in a couple of mystery shops on top of it --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- [SIGH] so we can have lunch while we're there?"  [SIGH]
L:  Right.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  So, I -- I went out and bought this big c- calendar [LAUGH] and keep filling it up.  [LAUGH]
L:  Good stuff.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, can you hold on one second?
R:  Yep.
L:  Thanks.  [NOISE]  Hey, could I bother you for a cigarette?  [NOISE]  [PAUSE]  [NOISE]  [PAUSE]  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  [PAUSE]  Hello, Kelly?  [LAUGH]
R:  Hi.  [LAUGH]
L:  Sorry.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  A fitness trainer that's --
L:  It's really bad of me.  [LAUGH]
R:  What?  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  That's really bad.  [SIGH]  I'm on this street corner and, ah, I just bummed a cigarette off someone w- [LAUGH] while I'm on the p- [LAUGH] phone call.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's not supposed to be part of my judgement and stuff like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that, you know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, anyway, we should --
R:  That's funny.
L:  -- get on topic.  Let's talk about h- health and fitness.
R:  Yeah.
L:  How ... health and fitness oriented are you, Kelly?
R:  [SIGH]  I'm Terry, -- um, not very.  I am -- am horrible, am lazy.  [SIGH]  But --
L:  And why is that?  [SIGH]
R:  I have no idea.  I guess I was just made that --
L:  Like you -- you just don't care about it or it's not priority to you?  [SIGH]
R:  I think p- pain is my major motivation, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- not to do it.  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Right, --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- understandably.  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  So, what motivates you to do it?
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Um, I'm actually a dancer.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  So, that's kind of where I've come from.  [SIGH]  And then t- through that I've found, like, the fitness world, and I honestly started just doing it for money, 'cause I normally go to the gym and work out anyway just, you know, to keep myself in shape.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  And, um, rather than paying -- I live in New York City where, like, the gyms are unbelievably expensive.
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  So, rather than paying, like, [SIGH] a hundred and fifty dollars a month, [SIGH] I now teach aerobics and I get money, [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, I get paid to do what I used to pay to do, you know?
R:  That works.
L:  So, um, I just met a friend one day and he was, like, "Hey, why don't you get certified, you know?" and I'm like, "Oh, really?" you know [SIGH] and it cost, like, you know, a hundred dollars to get cert- --
