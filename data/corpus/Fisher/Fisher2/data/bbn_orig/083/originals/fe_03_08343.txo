R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name [NOISE] is Marion. [NOISE]
L:  Uh, hi, this is Kenny.
R:  And I'm from New Jersey.
L:  I'm from Ohio --
R:  Ohio --
L:  -- how are you?
R:  -- how's the weather out there?  Hot?
L:  What's that?
R:  Is it hot out in Ohio?
L:  No, it's raining and windy.
R:  Oh, I wish --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we'd get some rain.
L:  Really?
R:  Health and fitness [NOISE].  Well --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- uh, [NOISE] I'm seventy four [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] and, uh, I do the treadmill every day [COUGH] and I like to walk and I garden.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] So, I think that's not too bad but my knee is going, you know.  Gotta keep going. [LIPSMACK] What about you?
L:  Well, since I have had two back surgeries --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- I try to get as much as, um, therapy I -- I can do.  Like I do a lot of walking.  I do ten miles a day of --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- walking.
R:  That's a lot. [NOISE]
L:  Uh, well, I do five in the -- in the morning and five at night mainly.
R:  Wow, that's a lot.  That's a lot of walking.
L:  Well, doctor tells me I'm supposed to do more than that but I can't do it.
R:  So, you find that that does help your back?
L:  Um, I don't think it does but well ...
R:  And yet they say -- uh, I know my [NOISE] daughter had knee surgery a while back --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, uh, by exercising, it seemed to have [NOISE] gotten better.
L:  Really?
R:  She didn't have to have the surgery but -- well, she didn't have [NOISE] surgery, she had an injury [NOISE].  So that [NOISE] -- I think it does help with certain things and I know the back -- my son -- other son-in-law has a bad back and the doctor gave him a whole series of exercises to do, rather than have surgery.  So, I think, in some ways, [NOISE] it's -- exercise does help. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, it does.  If they would've told me that ten or seven years ago, that you know, all these -- you could, um -- different things that you can do, I probably would've done it to avoid surgery but everybody told me I had to go through surgery when I broke my back.
R:  Wow, my husband had a broken back in service.
L:  'Cause I -- I --
R:  Had a laminectomy.  Is that what you had?
L:  I -- I fell thirty five feet.
R:  [MN] Wow.  That must have hurt.
L:  Mm, I don't remember too much of that though.
R:  Yeah [NOISE].  But the fact that you can walk ten miles a day, that's quite [NOISE] an accomplishment.
L:  Yeah -- yeah and I -- after ten miles, I limp really bad.
R:  What other kind of exercises do --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- you do?
L:  Um, I use like -- just like you, um -- I actually go to therapy and they, uh, work with my legs and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, treadmill and, um, I forget these, uh, exercises but I usually use my steps.  Like, uh, standing up against the wall and, um, climb one step and then like, uh, raise my right foot and then come down off the step and then take my left foot, go up on the step and then try to l- -- raise --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- my left foot and then come back down.  And you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- do that for fifteen minutes and then I got other, um -- other exercises I made up --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like leaning up against a chair and then, um, [COUGH] raise my, uh, left leg back as far as I can.  I try to stretch the hamstring on it and then I do the same thing with the right -- right leg and then my other one is, uh, I'm trying to jog now but when you smoke it's kind of hard.  'Cause I only want to jog for about two minutes and I'm --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- done.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, that's [NOISE] hard.  So, what do you think about exercising?  I guess, we're supposed to talk about everybody [LAUGH] else's, [NOISE] right? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Worry about the kids, [NOISE] they don't [NOISE] exercise, right?
L:  Yeah.  I try to exercise.
R:  [NOISE] We do.  And, uh, I think the kids today don't do it.  You know, they're all kind of on the lazy side.  I think they'd just as soon sit and play games, which is not a good thing.
L:  Well, I wish I was a kid again.
R:  Really?  Yeah, well, we all do.  Probably like to --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- be twenty five again, right?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And know what we know [NOISE] today [NOISE].  That's the whole [NOISE] thing. [LIPSMACK] But anyway, I think exercise is good for everybody and you know, it's good therapy to walk.  Don't you find that?  When you walk along, you think about a lot of things and you look around and you see things, you talk to people.
L:  Actually --
R:  I --
L:  -- you know what?  I don't -- I don't -- you know, I don't walk around where there's a lot of people.  Where I take my walks, I just -- I go in the woods.  I take hikes.
R:  Well, even --
L:  I take --
R:  -- that, you're out [NOISE] with mother nature and you see [NOISE] things [NOISE] and it's quiet and it's stressful.  I think it's wonderful to walk.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] I think it -- it doesn't cost anything [NOISE] --
L:  No.
R:  -- and it's great therapy.
L:  Yep and it -- especially when I'm walking up some big hills.
R:  Big hills.  Yeah, I don't like big hills.  I don't -- I avoid big hills.
L:  Oh, it -- doctor says, "Find you some hills and start walking" and I'm like --
R:  Really?
L:  -- yeah, 'cause he says, "You know what?  It's better than ..." you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- 'cause I went through epi- er, um -- nerve block da- -- nerve injections and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- nerve blocks, uh, epidurals and stuff and he says, "You need to walk some hills".
R:  Wow.
L:  And I'm like, "What do you mean by hills?"  He says, "Hills that's like on a ninety degree, seventy five degree" and I'm like, "Okay".  He says, "If you can find you some boots or like hard -- hard, um, steel toed boots, wear them.  You need to sweat".
R:  Wow.
L:  "And it'll -- it'll help your left leg out the most and also you'll lose weight and it'll be better on your back and plus it'll help your back out more".  So, that's what I do.
R:  Well, that's true too.  I suppose losing [NOISE] the weight --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- and a good source of exercise is good [NOISE] for that particular reason [NOISE].  But it's [NOISE] tough [NOISE] to exercise and of course if you work, [NOISE] it's hard to do it every day.  I think a lot of people don't do it because they work but I'm, thank God, retired, so I can [COUGH] go on my treadmill.  Also, I go for a walk every day just to keep my legs going.  I think it's good when you sit all [NOISE] day [NOISE], you know, you get stiff. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I retired at a really early age.
R:  Did ya? [NOISE]
L:  Twenty seven --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- years old.
R:  Wow, that was young.  And how old --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- are you now, may I ask?
L:  I'm thirty six.  
R:  Oh, yeah, you're still young. [NOISE]
L:  I'll be thirty six on the twentieth.
R:  Uh-huh.  So, you're still --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- retired [NOISE], right?
L:  Yep.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Social security.
R:  Wow.  What did ya fall off of?  A roof?
L:  I was working in Las Vegas and I fell off a scaffold off of the Luxor.
R:  Oh, wow, the hotel.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's big.
L:  Before it was built.
R:  I hope they gave you a free room for life.
L:  Mm, no, uh, they -- they paid for my, um, hospital bill.  They paid for me to go through therapy --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for four months and I learned how to walk again.  They sent me to a back surgeon and I wouldn't go to him, er, waited 'til I came back to Ohio and then I waited about four years and my back started giving me a lot of problems and my spine dropped like about an inch --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I went through my first back surgery and then he didn't do nothing except take a disc out and within eight months my disc -- er, my spine dropped two inches and they had to go in there and ja- -- I guess, they use like a -- like -- he said he used a, um, bumper jack to jack me up and they put bullets in my back that, um, hold my back up 'cause I'm six, six and when --
R:  Right.
L:  -- yeah, I went down, I went to six, four and they had to put me back up or I'd be hunched over.
R:  Well, do you think that all --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- this exercise you do, is going to be a big improvement?  Is it going to make an improvement?
L:  It's doing a little bit of improvement but I wish my numbness in my left leg would go away.
R:  But the very fact that you could walk ten miles a day, I mean, [LAUGH] that's not a small accomplishment.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, I -- I know [NOISE] I couldn't do it.  I don't know anybody around here that would walk ten miles a day.  That's quite a l- long walk.
L:  Uh, it -- it takes me a long time to walk it.
R:  I would think so.
L:  'Cause I have to sit down for a while and then I get up and I walk.
R:  Mm.
L:  It takes me about two hours to walk about five miles.  Two hours to walk five more miles.
R:  Well, what do you think about a treadmill?
L:  I do that for prob- -- probably -- when I go to therapy I do that for about a half hour.
R:  [NOISE] You don't have one in your house where you --
L:  No.
R:  -- could, on rainy [NOISE] days, use it?
L:  No.
R:  [COUGH] I think they're wonderful.  They're so convenient.
L:  [COUGH] Actually, I go to YMCA if I want to get on the --
R:  Well, that's --
L:  -- treadmill.
R:  -- good.  And it's nice to be able to watch TV.  I have one in my basement and you know, time --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- goes so quickly when you're on it and before you know it, you've walked a couple of miles and [NOISE] you've enjoyed the TV.  Also and it's cool, actually if it's hot out and, uh, I hate to walk in the heat, so I think that a lot of people don't do it for that reason.  So, it's nice to have an inside gym.  I think a lot of people do have them in their homes today.  Most of my kids have one room that they have, you know, for a treadmill or whatever heck else they buy.  But --
L:  I -- I do have weights in the basement but --
R:  Do you?
L:  -- yeah, but I ain't allowed to lift. [MN]
R:  You're not allowed to lift them yet?
L:  No --
R:  Well --
L:  -- no, I'm not allowed to lift at all but you know, I got friends that come over and they're like, "Kenny, can we go down in the basement and lift?"  I'm like, "Go ahead". 
R:  Yeah, be my guest, right?
L:  Yep, go ahead.  There's a --
R:  And now would that form of exercise help your back eventually?
L:  If I was to lift weights, I would be paralyzed.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  'Cause I ain't allowed to lift more than ten pounds.
R:  Okay.  So, you'll never get --
L:  And I've got some friends that can lift three hundred and fifty plus and there's probably weights that are five hundred down there --
R:  And are they --
L:  -- in pounds.
R:  -- in good shape because of that?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yes?
L:  Yeah, they're, um -- they're college students and they play football for Ohio State, so, that's why they -- they lift.
R:  Yeah.  Huh, that's interesting.  Well, I don't know [SIGH], exercise is good and I guess the kids -- I wish more --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of my grandch- kids would do it but they're all so lazy.  They don't seem to be involved [NOISE].  Even in sports, you know, they'd rather sit home and play video games [NOISE] and watch TV and so on, so forth.  And I guess that's the problem in this country today, the kids being overweight and whatever.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- eating all the junk food and [LIPSMACK] what have you.
L:  I eat junk food but I still stay at two oh eight.
R:  Do you really?
L:  For six, six.
R:  Yeah but you're six, six, so, that's okay.
L:  I s- -- you know, I -- I eat candy and all that and I --
R:  And you --
L:  -- cannot --
R:  -- also walk -- walk ten pounds a day.
L:  Yeah but I still -- you know, if I -- if it's raining -- like we had rain for three straight days and when I went -- and we didn't have rain and it was heated and it was so hot, there was no way I was going out.  I stayed in.  Like when I had my thing done on my back --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- um, two weeks ago, I stayed in the house for a week, 'cause I couldn't move and I didn't walk nowhere and I had elevated my left leg 'cause my left leg went --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- swelled for -- comes -- the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- nerve --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- blocks they did on me.  All I did was have friends come over and give me junk food.  They're --
R:  Uh-oh.
L:  -- like, "Kenny, you need to eat regular".  You know, I'm like, "Man, I will when the time comes and I start walking again".  They're like, "You gotta do it now".  I'm like, "Go over there and get me some Hershey's, I'm craving Hershey's".  I don't know why.
R:  Hershey bars or --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- Hershey ice cream?
L:  -- Hershey bars because I think --
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  -- it was the steroids that they shot up -- shot me --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with.
