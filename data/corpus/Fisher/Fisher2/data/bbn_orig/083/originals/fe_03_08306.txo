L:  Are you there?
R:  Hi, yeah.
L:  Hi.
R:  My name's Doug.
L:  My name is Emily.
R:  Hi, Emily.
L:  Hi.
R:  Interesting topic, I guess.
L:  I guess so [LAUGH].  You wanna go first?
R:  Um, where do we begin?  I'm -- it -- it was specifically about schools and, uh --
L:  Didn't it say about schools, um, --
R:  And whether they have the right to censor --
L:  Certain books and everything else.
R:  Certain books.  Mhm.
L:  Well, I think they ought to be censored in some aspects, yeah.
R:  Oh, really?  Like ...
L:  Like, um, language --
R:  I mean --
L:  -- and stuff like that.
R:  So, depending on the -- the school and the, um -- I mean, the age of the kids and the type of school or ...
L:  Right.
R:  Mhm.  But don't you think that's against the spirit of free speech and all those good things?
L:  Well, on some topics.  It just depends on what the books are about.  Some kids shouldn't be addressed to that though, don't you think?
R:  Yeah, I -- I think there is something certainly to be said for appropriateness.
L:  Right.
R:  So, what else is there to say?
L:  This is a hard topic, you know [LAUGH].
R:  What -- well, have you had -- had any, um, any, uh, personal experience with, um, books that like -- well, I don't know, I guess you look at it in a couple of different ways.  Like books that you read that you were shocked that you -- you felt you shouldn't be have been -- that should have been censored for you or --
L:  I actually -- no, I mean, you know, um, when I was in school, our books was really -- already picked out and really wasn't no censors -- you know, didn't really need to be censored.  I mean, we had Run, Spot, Run [LAUGH].
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH] So ...
R:  But you wouldn't feel deprived like, uh, if somebody said, "Oh, no you can't read that book until you're, you know, uh, in -- in high school or something".
L:  Right.
R:  Like the -- the -- they're taking away something or -- or that wasn't how you were brought out.  You didn't even think that way.
L:  I didn't think that way, no, but I reckon because I was in a Christian home and everything else I probably didn't think about that anyway because I knew basically I -- well, Mum picked out most of our books if we were somewhere and -- like the library or somewhere, she picked out our books and --
R:  Mhm.  So, so if you had kids of your own --
L:  Well, I have a fifteen year old and I pick out books and I mean, I don't see that I've deprived him or anything.  Uh --
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, I mean it's -- it's sort of a [MN] -- what -- what do they mean by censorship, I guess, that's the --
L:  That's the big thing right --
R:  -- that's the question.
L:  -- there I guess.
R:  You know, like is it -- is it like books with -- that are edited or books, you know, with, um --
L:  I wonder --
R:  -- things crossed out.
L:  -- if it was like appropriate language or --or about God or something like that and in my opinion -- I don't know about your opinion, I think God needs to be more into the -- the school system --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- then we might not have the problems that we have today.
R:  Mhm.  It's a -- it's -- it's a -- it's certainly a possibility.  I think I'm -- I'm sort of more open minded in -- in saying there should be a choice.  I mean, some people go the other way.
L:  Yeah, there should be -- I mean, exactly, it should be a choice and everything else but I mean, you shouldn't knock it out completely because hey, John Doe, over here doesn't believe in this, you know what I'm saying?  Because --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- there's kids that does which I mean I don't understand because in the school system when I grew up we didn't have a problem with it.  We done the pledge allegiance every day.  We done --
R:  Under God.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Indivisible, right?
L:  Right.
R:  Not edited.
L:  Not edited at all.
R:  Mhm, so but now if, you know, some people will -- will go the other way and say, "Oh, anything mentioning God should be censored".
L:  Right.
R:  Now, in that -- in that sense [LAUGH] of censorship you would say that they shouldn't be censored.
L:  I guess so.  The -- you know, for different beliefs or whatever but I mean, I don't understand today's world.  I honestly don't because when I grew up we didn't have no problem.  Everybody got along with everybody --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and there was no controversy in the school system like there is today.
R:  Mhm, mhm, mhm.  So -- so would censorship help that?
L:  Well, they censored it out.  They don't have God in -- in schools now.
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  So, that makes the argument the other way.  Yeah, yeah.  No --
L:  So, is that right or wrong?  In a way, I mean, would be, you know, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't know.
R:  Right.  Well, I mean who's gonna decide what's right or wrong --
L:  Is this your first time doing this?
R:  -- years from now?  Um, second time.
L:  This is my first time.
R:  Oh.
L:  I didn't know really what the -- what to think when I called and all that stuff.
R:  Yes, it's a -- it's a great, great adventure.  I'm just wondering are they censoring our [LAUGH] our --
L:  Censoring our phone call [LAUGH].
R:  -- phone calls or what --
L:  That's what I was wondering if -- how it would eventually work.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I don't know what it -- it's not really clear what they're studying.  You know, whether it's like opinions or speech patterns or, um, just, you know --
L:  If people actually can talk to a total stranger --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- about a topic and keep it up for eight minutes [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, well or -- or -- or have a theory about, um, maybe it's the -- the phone, um -- like maybe they're -- they're trying to transcribe it like they're having a computer that's trying to, um, write down what we're saying.
L:  Right.
R:  That kind of thing and so they're, you know -- I -- I mean, it's a total guess 'cause I have no idea.  No idea.
L:  It's pretty cool though.  I like it.
R:  Yes.  It's neat.  So, schools, I don't know.  I mean, I was sort of brought up in, uh, you know, more of a -- a liberal thinking, "Oh, no, you know, nothing should be censored" and, uh --
L:  What age group are you in?
R:  But -- um, [MN] I just turned forty five.
L:  Okay.  You're -- you're seven years older than I am.
R:  Mhm, and grew up on the east coast.  Sounds like you're more from the south or ...
L:  I'm from the South [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I'm from the east coast sort of kinda too.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah, I'm from Georgia.  I ain't too far from the east coast.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  Yeah.  Where are you from?
R:  New York.
L:  Cool.  You don't live there [LAUGH].
R:  Well, cool is not the word.  Either for Georgia.
L:  Sure is hot here.
R:  Very hot.
L:  It's been a hundred degrees.
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, censorship.  Just so that we -- make sure we earn our ten dollars [LAUGH].
L:  Would they cancel it if you didn't do your ten dollars?
R:  They might.  I don't know.
L:  Oh.
R:  I don't know.
L:  Censorship in schools.
R:  Censorship of -- yes, I -- I'm not sure they're talking about censorship like of words.  Like a certain language shouldn't be used.  Um, and then language creates thoughts so then if you're not allowed to think certain thoughts, you know, it sounds like a way of, uh, -- like who's gonna decide?  I -- I think that's really the question that's raised.  Like who decides what's to be included and what's to be censored.  That's -- 
L:  That would be the thing is who -- who --
R:  That's the dangerous part.
L:  -- who decides.
R:  I think that's the dangerous part, you know, so how do you, you know, and --
L:  How do you write and how do you figure out --
R:  Yeah, how do you--
L:  -- what should be censored and what shouldn't be.
R:  Right.  How do you form a consensus?  I mean, is there going to be, like, a community vote and well, if you're in this school district then, uh, you know, these books are allowed or -- and in other they're not or is it a government wide thing or [MN] --
L:  But does the -- the president of the school board do the censorship --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- to determine what is censored and what is not?
R:  It's an idea but then it's, like, one person.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, I mean --
L:  Well, a school board is -- is -- I reckon not the director of the school board but I reckon the school board maybe censors everything --
R:  Well --
L:  -- and comes up with an agreement of what should be done after they hear the voice of the people maybe.
R:  Yeah, that could -- well, I mean I'm sure there's --you know, there's a curriculum that's put together but like -- I mean, think of, um [MN] where's -- I read something like in -- in, um -- in China I -- I -- it's probably still going on but, you know, where they're -- they're censoring the Internet.  I mean, we're -- we're talking about books now right but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but probably, you know, all the -- the -- the -- the young kids that I know, everything is --
L:  Is Internet and everything else --
R:  I mean, three year olds --
L:  -- and to me, I think that --
R:  -- five year olds --
L:  I think there is stuff, you know, as far as the Internet that should be censored.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, I don't -- I think some of these kids shouldn't be getting a hold of some of this stuff that they get into.
R:  Right, exactly.  But then what if you get to, um, like a governmental control.  That's where it's getting to, like, in China for example, where, you know, they want everybody to pledge allegiance, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- basically to their government and in that way they're -- they're censoring like any news from the -- from the outside, from other countries.
L:  That's right.
R:  So, it's -- is that dangerous?  That's -- I guess that's the question.  You know, taking -- basically taking away people's choice.  That's -- that would be the argument, I guess, ag- against censorship.
L:  Did you say ...
