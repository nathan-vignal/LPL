R:  Okay, mm, so, what --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- about you?  Do you do any --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- exercises?
L:  Very little.  Um, I should do more but I don't. [LAUGH]
R:  Why?
L:  With my work schedule, it's very hard.  Um, so, I usually -- I try to walk when I can and I have a lot of exercise videos but I don't do them regularly.
R:  Oh, so you only watch videos --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you don't do any of them? [LAUGH]
L:  No, not regularly. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  What about you?
R:  Yah, I sometimes, uh, I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm not also --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- very regular but I, uh, do often go for playing tennis.  Sometimes --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I play soccer, maybe I even go for walking also.
L:  Oh, yes, some good activities.
R:  Yah.  So and do you know what cricket -- there's a game called cricket.
L:  [NOISE] S- cricket?
R:  Yah, have you heard of it?
L:  Uh, uh-huh.
R:  Yah, sometimes I play that as --
L:  [NOISE]
R: -- well.
L:  Okay.
R:  It's a kind of --
L:  So, you just keep --
R:  -- base- --
L:  -- active?
R:  Yah, it's a baseball --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- kind of game, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's very enjoyable.
L:  Yeah, I have family in Bermuda, so that's where I know cricket from.
R:  Okay, great
L:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.  No, I don't really do activities.  Um, I played basketball in high school and college --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and that, you know, keeps you in shape but after that I didn't really keep going.
R:  Okay.  What do you do now?  Like, what is a profession?
L:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] Uh, I'm in event planning.
R:  Sorry, uh, hm?
L:  Yeah, I'm an event planner.
R:  What's that?
L:  I plan parties and receptions.
R:  Okay.  So ...
L:  So, I'm very -- so, my schedule is very, very flexible all the time.
R:  Okay.
L:  And it could change at a moment's notice.  Like I don't have any set hours.  I just kind of work when I have to, so ...
R:  Yah, that really hurts because you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, you cannot plan your things and you --
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah, and you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- cannot go any times, so --
L:  Right, I joined a gym but I just never can go, so my membership is just sitting there. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So, you're with --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a car, or something?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Maybe the --
L:  Sorry?
R:  You're with the car or something, so ...?
L:  In a car?
R:  Yah, do you have a car?
L:  Yeah, I'm in the car now, on my way home from work. [NOISE]
R:  Okay, so, that is like, uh, maybe you can go --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- over to park or something --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- sometimes?  Maybe some --
L:  Some -- sometimes --
R:  -- [several inaudible words].
L:  -- but it's hard.
R:  Yah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Where do you stay?  Like, which place?
L:  Hm?
R:  Which place do --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you stay?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Where do I live?
R:  Oh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is it like a big city?
L:  Yeah, I'm in Washington DC.
R:  Okay, Washington DC.  Uh, that's a big --
L:  Mm --
R:  -- city.
L:  -- and where are you?
R:  Oh, I'm in Louisiana, Baton, Louisi- --
L:  [NOISE] Okay, Baton, okay.
R:  Yah, yah, this is a small place.  Like because in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- New York and like if you're in the big cities --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you have like lot of travel, lot of time you spend in traveling.
L:  Right.
R:  [several inaudible words].  That's all a waste of your time.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, uh.
L:  Right.  What I do try to do, which kind of helps sometimes, is when I go like to stores and to the mall, I park really far away.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I try to walk, you know, a little --
R:  Yah.
L:  -- bit extra.
R:  So, how are -- how are you doing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on your weight?  Like, are you -- how much -- how are you doing on your weight?
L:  Um, I'm like average.  I'm like a hundred and thirty five pounds.
R:  Okay.
L:  You know, so I'm -- I'm -- I'm petite and I'm average.  I'm not overweight or underweight, you know.
R:  Okay.
L:  But everybody could stand to be toned, you know and healthy. [NOISE]
R:  Yah, yah, that is -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but one thirty five, like is it tall -- how is -- is it, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like good for your, uh, height or something?
L:  Yeah, it's fine for my height.
R:  Yah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so, then that should be -- that should look like [several inaudible words].
L:  Exactly.  But exercising also helps you just to stay healthy.  You know, everything --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- from, you know, keeping your bones from getting stiff and you know, all that kind of stuff.
R:  Yah, and keeping your muscles --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and other things --
L:  Right, gives you good flexibility, good muscle tone --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- um, you know, all that kind of stuff.
R:  Mhm, hm.
L:  Yeah.  Do you, um -- [LIPSMACK] do you go to a gym at all?
R:  Uh, no -- no, not exactly --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- gym but yah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I do go for some time, like for walking.
L:  Do activities.
R:  Yah, I do --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- activities and things like that.
L:  And what do you wor- -- where do you work?
R:  Yah, no, I'm -- I'm graduate student, so ...
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, you're a student.  Okay.  
R:  Yah, yah, so normally like, uh --
L:  Oh, okay, so, well, I guess you walk around campus, right?
R:  Yah, yah, actually a lot --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like [NOISE] even now [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I have been --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- walk some, you know, a couple of miles --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Uh-huh.
R:  -- I went to class and I came back from there.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, it was like, you know, it is exercise in a way.
L:  Right.
R:  So, because normally like when I come --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- back, er, like I don't have a car and so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I have to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- walk, you know, most of the time like, uh, I go like, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- especially to my school and all, I go --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- walking.  I go walking.
L:  Right.
R:  Hm, so, that helps a lot and then --
L:  Oh, of course that helps, heck yeah.
R:  Yah, and then I have to come back most of the time --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- from the school.  So, but we do have a bus but most of the time what I do, like in the evening, I will do like, I'll -- I -- I -- I won't take a bus --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I'll walk all the way back.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  So that is a couple of miles to walk.
L:  Right.
R:  Yah, but that is like good for, uh, like, uh, fitness but if you want, uh, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, it's more for, buh, like, er -- like muscles and all --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like if you want --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to do that, it means walking, all that doesn't help that much.  You need to do --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- workouts and all.  Then --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, it really helps, like it doesn't --
L:  Right.
R:  Yah.
L:  Yeah, I walked a lot in college, a whole lot in college.  Much more than I walk now.
R:  Mhm, hm.  So, where do you --
L:  Just --
R:  -- live?
L:  -- because --
R:  Mhm.  Where do --
L:  You know, it was just -- walking was the way to get around. [LAUGH]
R:  Yah, yah, yah, and, uh, because only the college --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- campus is really big --
L:  Right --
R:  -- [several inaudible words].
L:  -- right.  Because our campus was and nobody had a car and you just had to get there, so you didn't really have a choice. [LAUGH]
R:  Yah.
L:  It has to happen.  So, do you want to workout more in the future, or are you in pretty good shape, you think?
R:  Uh, no, I plan to do more workout --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but I don't get time because of just classes --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and all.
L:  Because of school.
R:  It's like that, so because of that, like normally, I always think that I'll be doing more of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- this thing but it doesn't really -- you know, [LAUGH] and I'm not getting started.
L:  Right.
R:  I'll be like normally on weekends, only on holidays, I go for playing --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, regular like on weekdays, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the only thing I can do is like normally I go -- there's a pool in my --
L:  Right.
R:  -- apartment complex, so, it's the only, uh --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, [several inaudible words] --
L:  I understand that.
R:  -- nothing much and yah, not more than that.
L:  [NOISE] Right, right, right, that makes sense.  That makes sense.
R:  Mhm, hm.
L:  That makes sense.  Um, [LIPSMACK] what was I gonna say?  Um --
R:  So, how 'bout you?  Like, do you, or you plan to do more workouts in future?
L:  Um, yeah, I actually do want to do more.  I think that [LIPSMACK] a lot of people also tell me that, um, [LIPSMACK] it helps with stress.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, when you're able to get into, you know, a regular routine and workout more and, um, I'm sort of in a -- I'm -- I'm in a high stress profession, so, um, it's very easy to allow yourself to get stressed out and have no real release.  So, a lot of people in my office, um, actually workout together --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- after work a lot or flexible, you know, whenever they can --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they said that it helps them [LIPSMACK] do their job better because they feel like they have an outlet for their stress.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, that's about --
L:  So --
R:  Mhm, exactly.
L:  Hm?
R:  Uh, but like how is it, uh, lot of -- or stress in your profession, like, why --
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- is it so ...
L:  Um, just because you basically are responsible for so many details and there are so many people that you can't control but ultimately, you're still responsible, you --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- know.  Um, and unfortunately, some things, it's just -- you know, if you had a reception planned and for some reason, the food doesn't get there, you know, you got to make something happen then.  You know, if the -- the guest speaker can't make it, you got to make something happen, or you know, if all the hotel rooms are filled out, you got to make something happen. [LIPSMACK] You know, it's just -- everything is at the moment.  You know what I mean?
R:  Yah, yah, there's a lot of responsibility and on the --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- moment but --
L:  And there's no time to, you know, say, "Oh, well, you know, um, I can, you know, think about it tomorrow, or I can fix it when I can".  No.  Everything that we do is at the moment.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, you kind of have to be ready to always, you know, jump in and do what you can at a moment's notice.  So, that can be high stress.
R:  Oh, yah, yah, I understand that.
L:  So, especially a lot of my clients are, um, you know, congressional people, congressmen and senators --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, a lot of times, um, they don't really have the time, you know, or the energy and they don't really care what went wrong, they just want it to go right. [LAUGH]
R:  Yah, yah, that's right, so -- and you know --
L:  You know what I mean?
R:  Yah, I understand.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Uh, in your college, was there something you used to play --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- something?  You were in something, or something?
L:  Yeah, I played basketball.  Um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in high school and college, both.
R:  Mm.
L:  Um, and it was fun.  I enjoyed it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- plus I got to workout regularly.
R:  Mm.
L:  Um, you know, you get to, you know, really be, um -- [LIPSMACK] you get used to working out and once your body gets used to it, then I think you do better at it.  You know what I mean? 
R:  Yah, yah, yah, that's -- yah.
L:  [NOISE] And, uh --
R:  [several inaudible words] --
L:  -- I realize, I can tell like when, uh -- when I didn't play for like, you know, during the vacations and stuff, um, that, um, [LIPSMACK] my body will be much less flexible and I really didn't have as much energy [NOISE] as when I was working out.  All that kind of stuff, you know.
R:  Mhm, hm.
L:  So, uh, I do miss it and I -- I say that I'm gonna keep -- uh, that I want to start playing basketball again, so ...
R:  Yah, so why didn't you try basketball as a profession?  Maybe --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you could have tried that and been --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- a professional --
L:  A professional basketball player [LAUGH].  No, I wasn't that good. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, you weren't that good.
L:  No, not that good at all.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I still -- every now and then, like when I go and I'm like out and about, every now and then, when I make it to the gym, I'll play in, you know, like a pick up game of basketball.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yah.
L:  So --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, um -- but I don't play it regularly at all. [NOISE]
R:  Yah, [several inaudible words].
L:  Not at all.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Do you play a lot of tennis?
R:  Yah, not a lot of like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on weekends, yeah, we --
