L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  [NOISE] Hi.
R:  This is Megan Marks.
L:  My name is Kim.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi. [NOISE]
R:  Um, so I guess the topic for the day is health and fitness --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  -- and if we exercise regularly.
L:  Mm, I don't, do you?
R:  I kinda do off and on.  It really depends on how I'm feeling, I guess --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like I try to exercise in the morning, um, but I -- I can't always get myself out of bed. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I live on third floor so I go up and down the stairs subs and --
R:  Oh [LAUGH] so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I guess that works --
L:  -- carrying a stroller upstairs too.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, and I walk a lot.  I mean, I really don't exercise like go to the gym or anything.
R:  Right, I used to have a gym membership to Curves, I'm not sure if you're ever heard of that?  Um, it's where they have these, um, machines that work with air or something and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to build up the resistance.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, but then I just didn't go regular --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- enough.  I just can't get myself to, you know, get in the car and drive over there.
L:  Mm.
R:  Um, I have this thing th- um, that I do on tape, it's like walking in place or something --
L:  [NOISE] Oh wow.
R:  -- yeah, and, I don't know, I have the tapes out.  I did it yesterday, um, so like I don't do it regular enough but it's [NOISE], let's me see [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there -- it should be right here in the front room [NOISE], yeah, it's called Walk Away the Pounds with Lesley San- Sanson, Sanswan or something like that.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  Have you ever heard of that?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, so I do that.  My mom bought the tapes and she doesn't use 'em so I stole 'em. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm [LAUGH].  Yeah, that's all I do is walk and go upstairs [NOISE] and carry groceries, that's my exercise. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I -- I don't -- I don't grocery shop enough to have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, like carry it around or -- or do walking that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, yeah my mom and I go on walks, like, in the neighborhood.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We like to go and find homes that are for sale and walk through 'em.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  Yeah, so we do a lot of that.  Um, it's not regular enough to be considered exercise I don't think really.
L:  [MN] No.
R:  Um, I'm trying to think of something else.  I do a lot of bike riding.
L:  No, I don't have a bike.
R:  Oh, you don't have a bike.
L:  I -- like I said I -- I have a stroll- I have four kids and I've walked with them and --
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  -- [NOISE] carry -- I mean, go to stores and carry bags upstairs and go back down and carry more and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so that's the only exercise I do.  And then carrying a space stroller upstairs.
R:  So, what ages are your kids?
L:  Um, my oldest is ten and my youngest is four months.
R:  Mm.  Does your, um, ten year old play soccer or anything?
L:  [NOISE] No, she's lazy. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  She's a pure lazy child.
R:  Yeah, I used to play soccer when I was a little kid.  It helped me develop my calves a lot but I kinda don't do that anymore --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I wish I still did but it just -- it gets so advanced, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and so -- and then people start competing too much and it's just not fun anymore.
L:  Yeah.  Yep, and my eight year old she -- she's in gymnastics.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, she likes that.  So -- she likes to do [inaudible] but she doesn't like to compete or anything, she'll just go on certain days and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, and my six year old son, uh, he doesn't care anything else he just wanna be outside and play.
R:  Right.  Yeah, my little brother's like that, he goes out and plays basketball a lot and rides his bike with his friends and stuff.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Actually his friends have these little motorbikes so he likes to ride those around. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh wow. [NOISE] Oh wow, um, my kids do a lot of swimming too.
R:  Oh, swimming?
L:  Yeah, so maybe that's exercise too, I don't know.
R:  Yeah, I think it can be considered exercise.  I mean, you're exerting a lot of energy when you swim.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, and, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I heard that, like, if you don't drink a lot of water after you get out of the pool --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- that you can actually be dehydrated 'cause you sweat --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- 'cause you're exerting so much.  But, um, you don't -- you don't realize you're sweating --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- 'cause you're all wet.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, yeah, I think that would be a form of exercise.
L:  Yeah.  So, no, that's about all we do.  And, um, it's hard 'cause I'm a single mom so I do everything by myself.
R:  Oh.
L:  [MN] So, it's really hard and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so --
R:  I -- I don't have any kids so I don't know how that is.
L:  No.
R:  No. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I'm only nineteen so --
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm -- I will be thirty two this Saturday.
R:  Mm, that's not too old.
L:  No, I -- I tell my kids I'm getting old --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- they say, "No you're not". [LAUGH]
R:  No.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I'm trying to think of anything else to say.
L:  Mm.
R:  You know, you wouldn't think it'd be so hard to talk for ten minutes on one thing but --
L:  Oh, I don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Um --
L:  Oh, I don't know, I mean --
R:  Let's see.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, I'm from New York State, where are you from?
R:  I'm over in Utah.
L:  Oh, you are?
R:  Yeah --
L:  Oh wow.
R:  -- it has been so hot lately --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it's been, like, record breaking hot.
L:  Oh, wow. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, it's been like a hundred and thirteen some days.
L:  Oh wow. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, so I -- I don't wanna go out and walk [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I wanna stay inside the house and --
L:  I don't blame you with the air conditioner.
R:  -- and -- and read a book. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, we had hot days and today was a cool day.
R:  I heard, um, like over there during the winter you guys had snow drifts that were like twenty feet high.
L:  [MN] Depends where you are.  Um, I live in -- if you -- you ever have a computer?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Well, you can look up, um, we're in Owego, New York --
R:  Owego?
L:  Yeah, and, um, we have -- we have snow and -- and -- but not really high, I mean --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- so we have the strawberry festival here, we have a lot of stuff going on and we have our hot days --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and then the highest we go up to is, um, about ninety eight.
R:  Ninety eight?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, that's like a regular day for us here right now.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] It's pretty bad.  All my plants are dying [LAUGH] I'm so sad for them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, got, like, no snow at all this year practically.  I mean, they had those machines up on the, um, mountains that --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- make the snow.
L:  Uh, yeah.
R:  And even with that the -- the ski slopes were closed a lot of the time.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  Which doesn't really affect me, I haven't been skiing in five or six years but my next --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- door -- well, my old next door neighbor she was, like, a professional skier --
L:  [NOISE] Wow.
R:  -- she would like go and, um, in mets and stuff and, like, get televised and stuff like that.
L:  Right.
R:  But I guess it -- it really didn't affect me a lot.
L:  Mm.
R:  So --
L:  Yeah, we get snow, we get a lot of snow.  We [MN] -- we get snow and then we get ice and -- we get the black ice and --
R:  Mm, yeah.
L:  [MN] I hate the black ice.
R:  Oh, so do I.  I almost, like, crashed my car of the edge of a cliff once 'cause my car wouldn't turn.  I, like, turned the wheel and my car --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just kept on going straight.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, I got so freaked out.
L:  [MN] Yeah, but we get -- we get a lot --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [inaudible], well this year we only got maybe like four or five snow [NOISE] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- really high.  Yeah, that's about it but it was really cold.
R:  Yeah, that doesn't sound too bad.  Yeah, it was not really cold but I had the cold winters where it's just -- you go outside and you feel like your nose is gonna fall off because it's just so cold.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah. [NOISE] Yeah, down here it gets cold too, so ...
R:  So, do you -- do you do a lot of skiing then?
L:  No, I don't.  My friends does.  They always try and tell me, "Oh, come on, it's fun".
R:  Yeah.
L:  I say, "Uh-huh, I fall on my butt".
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm just like, "It's fun for you maybe". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].  Yeah, you know, I says, "It's fun for you but I'd probably fall on my butt".
R:  Yeah.
L:  But we have a lot of snow and -- yeah, we have snow and ski down here and -- you still there?
R:  Yeah, I'm still here.
L:  Yeah, I thought I heard a click.
R:  Oh no, I'm sorry.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, but you can snow -- we have places to go snow s- s- um, skiing and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah, so --
R:  Um, so what kind of activities do you do in the summer?
L:  Well, we have the strawberry festival --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- we have, like, a fourth of July weekend, we had a big blast --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- everybody get together, have food and we have the country -- we have different bands and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, so we have -- we just go a new bridge built --

L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and there's, like -- there's nothing going on up here --
