R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name is Joy.
L:  Uh, this is David.
R:  Hi.  Did you want to talk first about the situation -- the -- the question?
L:  Sure.
R:  Okay.  Hello?
L:  Hello.  Um, what about the question?  I -- I -- this is the first time I do this.  I don't even what I'm doing here.
R:  Okay.  You didn't hear the question?
L:  Uh, sort of but I wasn't really paying a whole lot of attention.  My kid was talking to me.
R:  [LAUGH] That happened to me yesterday with my first time too.  So, yesterday was the first day and I didn't hear the question 'cause I was running water.  Um, but I did hear it today 'cause I knew what to expect 'cause I -- this is my second time doing it.  Um, the question is, um, do you -- do you think that, um, that people should be, uh, -- that schools should allow, um, children to read whatever kind of books they want?  Do you think there should be censorship in the schools?
L:  [COUGH] Are you want my --
R:  And I guess it's about -- I guess the censorship would mean like those books like Mummy has, um, -- Heather Has Two Mummies or Heather has Two Daddies.  There's these books -- I don't have children so, you know, [LAUGH] I'm in -- I'm not in that mode to -- to keep up with that but I do know there's a lot of controversy about, um, books that are talking about gay parents, you know what I mean?  Two women or two men and I think that a lot of private schools and certain -- there's a lot of controversy about peo- people don't -- schools do not want them -- those books allowed in the school --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and so it's about censorship.
L:  Uh --
R:  Okay?
L:  Okay.  Uh, well, I guess I -- everybody should be censored or should have some censor to it.  I don't think kids should be allowed to read any and all books.  Um, so I guess their teachers or whoever decides the, uh -- what they should read should be able to censor 'em.  Um, I censor my kids on a lot of things.  Um, music and what they read and what they see --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- what they watch on TV so ...
R:  How old are your kids?
L:  Uh, fifteen and twelve.
R:  Mhm.  Well, that's a vulnerable age.
L:  Yes, it is.
R:  That's -- that a very crucial age, um, for them to really be misled or to, you know, they could easily be brainwashed into a lot of bad stuff.
L:  Correct.
R:  Did you hear that?  Oh, I guess because it's being taped.  Did you hear the click?
L:  Yes, I did.
R:  [LAUGH] Can I ask where -- where are you -- uh, where you're located just out of curiosity?
L:  Uh, Washington, uh, Tacoma.
R:  Washington DC?
L:  No, just Washington.
R:  Oh, the state.
L:  Or -- or, uh, Washington.  Yeah, the state Washington.  Tacoma in Washington.
R:  Okay, I'm in California, San Francisco.
L:  Uh, and -- and you're just another person doing this survey?
R:  Um, I just -- yesterday was my first time calling.
L:  Uh --
R:  -- and -- and the woman that I spoke to yesterday was, um, very young.  It was about marriage, about -- she -- and she told me that she got a pay -- she just paid last week so I'm very, you know, rest assured that this is gonna be a situation that's not bogus, you know.
L:  Um, if you really want some good feedback on this subject --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- repeat to my wife this -- this question that they're asking.
R:  No, we can't do that.  You know --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- why?
L:  No.
R:  You know why?  Because they said if we go off the topic or, you know, and get like this -- this -- we won't -- it won't count.
L:  Uh [NOISE] --
R:  We won't get paid.  In other words, we really are supposed to stick to the subject matter --
L:  Correct.
R:  -- and -- and I don't think I could -- you know, I don't feel that they would go for the fact that she's not -- you know, I'm supposed to be talking to you.
L:  Uh --
R:  So, you would have to talk to her about this subject matter because, um, you know, you're the one signed for this, right?
L:  Uh, I guess.  I don't know what they're got going on here.
R:  Well, because they told me that if you go off the subject matter, you -- it will not -- you will not be paid for it.
L:  Uh [NOISE] okay.
R:  And -- and -- and I'm -- I'm -- I don't know the rules because you're bringing in a third party and I don't know if that's acceptable.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'd have to call the office and ask them because, you know, I'm new to this but, you know the woman that I spoke to with yesterday she -- she was seasoned and she said she just got a pay check but they said it takes six to eight weeks -- eight weeks to get paid but we better get back on the subject matter because, um, the ten minutes we're supposed to talk about the subject matter otherwise we'll be disqualified.
L:  Uh --
R:  And, um, and they tape everything we're saying.  Everything is being taped.
L:  [NOISE] That works for me.
R:  So, I would rather just stick with you because you're the one that I'm supposed --
L:  That's fine.
R:  -- to talk you.  If you don't mind.  I mean, I'd love to if it wasn't a study, you know what I mean?
L:  Yep.
R:  Um, I'll give you some of my feedback.
L:  There you go.  I hope you have about eight minutes worth [LAUGH].  
R:  Um --
L:  I've already outdone my talking.
R:  Well, my -- my situation, um, being in San Francisco and being very liberal, um, I think that children should be exposed to all types of lifestyles and I feel that -- I don't think that children should grow up not under- not -- not knowing that there are different kinds of lifestyle family structures --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that do not incorporate --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a man and a woman.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But I do feel that there is an age that you should -- there's approp- appropriate ages and it depends on the maturity of a child.  And I think that if a child is too young possibly, you know, maybe five years old or even six years old -- I don't really know, I have no children, as I say but I'm -- I worked with chil- children and I was a -- I used to be a school teacher in high school --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but I feel that if a child is too young who does not comprehend --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- information that could -- that could be a shocking uncomfortable situation so I think that, you know, it can be a very -- you know, a very uncomfortable situation and confusing to a child who is just learning about life.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, it's a kind of a hard for me to have -- to say that I'm kind of in the middle of the road.  I -- I do believe in censorship to some degree because, you know, I wouldn't want children reading pornography.  You know, I wouldn't want children going on the Internet and being able to, you know, go -- look at pornography at a very young age so I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I guess I could say that I would believe in porn- um, in censorship but I do -- you know, I do empathize with --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- same parent couples who have children and I see especially in San Francisco where there's a big gay cop- population here and there is a lot --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of gay families here.  And so, you know, it's -- it's very hard for these children to grow up --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- with no -- with no books to represent --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- their lifestyle and I feel that -- you know, I feel bad for these kids because I mean, like on Mother -- like on Father's Day and, you know, they have two mothers, you know, and, you know, they don't really know -- they don't have a father in the picture.  So, it's a very -- it's a very confusing situation and I think that, um, it's a very hard, uh, situation for me to, um, to really --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- give a yes or no answer on.  Did you have any feedback to what I had to say?
L:  [LAUGH] I can understand where you're coming from but as for holidays or anything else like that, I don't celebrate any so, uh, I don't miss anything on it.  Um, --
R:  Well, don't the children --
L:  -- it -- it happens all around me all the time and stuff.  Uh, there's information on it.  I -- it isn't taken out of context or anything else like that though.
R:  Yeah, but I'm saying like children when they go to -- when they're young, they make Mother's Day cards or they make something for their mother to bring home or on Father's Day, -- I don't in this generation but I know when I went to school we always made something for Mother's Day to bring to our mothers.  We always made something for Father's Day to bring to our dads.  Maybe times have changed and they don't-- they don't do that anymore.  I don't know because I'm not in -- you know, I don't have children as I say and I don't know what the protocol of school is -- is on, uh, unless I talk to my friends who have kids so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for me, you know, um, censorship doesn't really, um, have anything to do with my life but, you know, that's the subject we have to discuss and my opinions might be a little bit different because I'm not in a situation where I actually have to deal with those situations but I do know there's a lot of controversial, you know, about, you know, parents that are gay versus straight and, you know, some kids -- some families don't want their children associate with kids because their parents are not straight.  You know, they have -- they're -- they're -- the parents are, you know, two same sex couples and, um, I hear these things going on but, like I say, they don't affect me because I'm not in that world.
L:  [NOISE] Yes, I understand exactly what you're talking about.
R:  And so as far as censorship is concerned, um, I'm, you know, -- I guess I -- I have to say I'm slightly on your side of the fence where I do believe that there has to be some rules and regulations otherwise, you know, like it's just like, um, do you want your children to read about guns and knives and killing?  I mean, do you think that approp- it's appropriate to give your children gun magazines to read when they're five and six years old and talk about all these ....
