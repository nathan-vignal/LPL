R:  No, I go to a -- a health club that's, uh, a part of a chain and --
L:  No, I -- I j- I just walk -- you know, I walk, you know, hopefully like a mile a day if I could.
R:  A mile a day.  That's not a whole lot really.
L:  Mhm.
R:  How old are you?
L:  I'm forty two.
R:  Oh, okay I'm older than you.  You should be walking more than a mile a day.
L:  Oh, it's the time, you know, too.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, with -- you know, with the kids and [inaudible] and work and all the other things.
R:  Mhm, what do you do for a living?
L:  Well, you know, I do some, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, we got freelance work for rent control, uh, things in the city.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, you know, and with the kids in school and home [NOISE] so whatever -- you know, whatever I can put in a day I do.
R:  Mhm.  You have an apartment or a house there?
L:  No, a house.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, we're in the midst of trying to sell ours. [COUGH] So, um --
L:  Are you going for a condo [LAUGH]?
R:  Maybe a high rise.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Maybe a high rise.
L:  It's less work, right?
R:  Yeah, well we're downsizing.  We have a -- a pretty large house now.
L:  Right.
R:  Our second child's going to college --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I'm just tired of worrying about the pool and maintaining the pool and the house and the yard --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, that kind of thing and, you know, every time it rains, um, a little more of an ant pile --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- and I just, uh -- so that's what we're -- so we got a contract -- our first contract last night.
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  I mean, thing -- the -- the market's different here --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- than it is in your place.
L:  Oh, it's crazy here.  You know, I mean, everything's like three hundred, four hundred thousand for a little thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, and it's -- you know, it's like, uh -- so I guess wh- if you sell it where are you buy, it's just expensive to buy, you know, something else.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, it's -- it's hard.  You know, it's almost like, um, you might as well stay -- you know, what are you gonna do, even condos are three hundred thousand.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, it's like, um, if you bought ten -- five years ago with lots --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- y- more, you know, you could have done it but now it's like -- it's ridiculous, I don't know, who want -- you know, I -- I don't understand who spends his money for these things.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, where are you getting this money from?
R:  Mhm, mm.
L:  But everything is, like, relative too.  So, if you're making money whatever, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- what they sell something and they buy something [NOISE], uh, then it's like on- it's only, like, a hundred thousand difference, it's still a mortgage, I don't know.
R:  Mhm.  Mm.  Well, we got a pretty -- fair contract from these people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the price wasn't wonderful -- too wonderful, but the conditions are pretty good so -- on the contract so ...
L:  Uh, my father lives in Texas and, um -- outside of Houston.
R:  Oh, where?
L:  Um, in Friendswood.
R:  Oh, that's not too far from us, yeah.
L:  And he says, well, you know, the hard thing that after they build new houses --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, you know, it's hard -- you know, people rather buy a new house than a house --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [LAUGH] that someone lived in.
R:  Right, right.
L:  You know, so it's like a different, um, like there's two different, um, you know, like, um, venues here, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  So, even if it went up his house, it's not as much as it could of because people are not interested in it. [LAUGH]
R:  [COUGH] Yeah, they want the new house and the --
L:  They want the new house.
R:  -- um, things that, you know, the new [MN] --
L:  Yeah, they don't wanna -- they just wanna brand new house.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, 'cause even in any house you have to fix and change and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, and some people don't wanna do those things.
R:  Right, right, right.
L:  Well, over here, even if you buy a house for a lot of money still you have fix and change it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, but the housing stock is older too.  There's some new ones but the bulk is older, you know.
R:  Yeah, I have a sister that lives in Framingham outside of Boston and, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the prices are incredible there and you still -- you're paying four hundred thousand for a house and you still have to put a lot of money into it, so ...
L:  Right, right.  Yeah, because they're old or, you know --
R:  But the market -- I mean, the market's great there if you're selling.
L:  If you're selling, but -- and if you're selling and going somewhere else where it's cheaper [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, right, right, right.
L:  You know, like if you're selling or you got -- your downsizing, you're gonna get a condo --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or somewhere, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Then -- otherwise then wherever you gonna go it's gonna be the same money if you go into a -- you know.
R:  Yeah.  And --
L:  But --
R:  -- we're looking at renting --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- at least for a little while so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- until we decide, you know, if we wanna or whatever so that's -- that's a pretty good deal but, uh, you know, even af- --
L:  Yeah, but it's like -- you know, it's like when you get older you wanna go on vacation, you wanna do things, you don't worry about the house, you know.
R:  Right.  Right, that's true.
L:  And then it's the cleaning --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- it too and taking care of it.
R:  Yeah.  So, how many -- how many days a week do you walk?  I guess we need to talk about --
L:  Well, everyday.
R:  Uh-huh.  Do you do it by yourself or with a ...?
L:  Yeah, well I take the baby out and I'll --  you know, I'll going shopping and -- well, see the thing is you can walk everywhere here, you don't need to, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- even though I have a car but I'll walk to go shopping --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'll walk, you know, to the other store that's all the way down, like, a mile away or, you know --
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  -- and back or I'll go to the park and walk around the park a few times.
R:  You have one of those baby jogger things or ...?
L:  Um, not jog, I walk rather than jogging 'cause I don't want -- you know, the thing is with the jogging on the concrete is bad for your knees.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, 'cause you -- you know, so I just walk [inaudible] I mean, there's a lot of times you get too tired too fast.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, even though if you're on a thin- you know [NOISE] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so I take my time and I -- you know, and you -- you wanna enjoy what you're doing [NOISE].
R:  Right.
L:  But you don't -- you don't wanna think that you're exercising.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I -- I -- I -- I do it between three different cardio machines --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- and I -- and I do some, you know, some of the machines and floor --
L:  Yeah, the machines -- I used to go to a club a long time ago but it was a lot cheaper.  Now, they're so much money to go.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, there's one around the corner from me, it's like thirty five dollars a month, it's a small one, it's not even a big chain --
R:  Yeah, uh-huh.
L:  -- it's just -- it's one room, there's no showers, there's nothing, it's just like a room full of equipment.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that's like -- thirty five dollars a month that's like, you know, three, four hundred a year you're talking about.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, and it's like, um, just use a couple of machine -- okay, the only thing you get -- you're doing -- you're going somewhere to do it.  When it's in your house you never really do it [inaudible], you know.
R:  Mhm, yeah.  I pay a little more than that but mine is, uh, um, full of -- full service.
L:  Yeah, there's a full service, one thing.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  If you have pool and you can have, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, trainers and exercise classes --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but the thing is that -- if there was a more -- a full size class it'd be fine but to take the car to go somewhere and can't park --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, you know, it's like a pain -- it's like -- it come out to three hours extra in your day [NOISE].
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, you do an hour -- if you do an hour worth of --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- exercise [NOISE] by the time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you get there and back that's like another half hour, forty fiv- so, you're talking about three hours all together.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [NOISE] So, it comes like another job. [NOISE]
R:  Walking is real popular here and jogging --
L:  Mm [NOISE].
R:  -- but it's just so damn hot out during the summer.
L:  Yeah, well, th- it- it's been hot out here [NOISE] lately too but at least there's a breeze.
R:  What's your temperature?
L:  Well, it's been in the high eighties, nineties. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  And there's humidity here too but, um, today it rained a little bit so it cooled down [NOISE].
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] But the thing is, uh, basically, you know, it's like -- when it's, like, in the high nineties for the -- like, the last week it was -- there was one day where it was almost a hundred.
R:  Mm.
L:  And you can't really -- you can't walk around when it's like that 'cause it's too --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know.
R:  Not unless it's early in the morning --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or late at night.  Although I do see people jogging and running in the middle of the day but I think that's asking for a heart attack, I mean --
L:  Right, I think pe- you know, people even walking, when they were walking in the street there was some, uh, of the ambulances -- uh, some older people passing out.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because it -- when it's too hot --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, with this concrete th- you know, it's even hotter.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, you know, the glare on you, you know, it's like you're talking about, uh, so you have to take it easy, walk a little bit or go in the shade, take your time in doing it.  You cannot go --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, you dehydrate too fast.
R:  That's why I like going into the air conditioned health club.  I mean, I'm still sweating but --
L:  But it's not the -- you know, like you -- you feel --
R:  -- it's -- yeah.
L:  -- everything's sticking to ya.
R:  Yeah, not such a hazard.  Yeah.
L:  You know, but, uh, [NOISE] it's -- every little thing how it works -- you know, helps, you know [NOISE].
R:  Mhm.
L:  Even if you have a [NOISE] they say that's good.  Wait, what Theo? [NOISE] The rain went away. [NOISE] It stopped raining.
R:  How many kids do you have?
L:  Well, I have two.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, one thirteen and one three year old.
R:  Oh, that's a big difference.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I have two boys and they're five years --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- apart.
L:  Well, that's nice --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- five years is good.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, they're pretty different in personality but they're good kids.
L:  Oh, well they- I think every kid is.  You know, we have a --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- couple -- they all different [MN].
R:  Mhm.
L:  My two totally different from each other.
R:  How come you waited so long?
L:  Uh, it just [NOISE] -- you know, it -- it just happened like that, you know.
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] You know, when [NOISE] -- in a few minutes.  But, um, that's -- you know, that's --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- what happens some- you know, you wait and wait and then you say, may as -- you know.
R:  And they get along pretty well?
L:  [NOISE] Uh, they do and they don't.  Now, they have their moments --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, they -- sometimes the older can't take enough of -- you know, it's too much.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And if isn't what he's doing he don't wanna deal with him.
R:  What does your husband do?
L:  Um, he works for the state, New York state [NOISE] with the rent control also.
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  So --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- so that's basically it, you know, I don't know what other, you know, exercising things they wanted to hear [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I don't -- I thought somebody was, like, supposed to interview us or something.
L:  I thought so too.  I thought it -- asked a couple of questions what you do, you know -- [NOISE] you know.
R:  I guess they're recording this or -- I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I have no idea.
L:  I mean, how much can you talk about exercise? [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] I mean, only if that's your job, you know [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.
