L:  Hello, I'm Ava.
R:  Hi, I'm --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Bernice.
L:  [NOISE] Yes, the topic was health and fitness?
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And I personally try very hard --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to keep myself healthy and I exercise each evening before bedtime mainly, um, a, uh, stretching type exercise.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, my husband and I do a lot of walking.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I do so- I -- uh, right now I have my leg weights on.  I was doing the Pilates for my [NOISE] exercise.
R:  Mhm.  And --
L:  So, everyday I do that.
R:  Do you --
L:  I --
R:  -- find that that helps?
L:  Yes, I lost inches --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in the last couple of weeks.
R:  Ah!
L:  Yes, [NOISE] I lost inches.  You just have to do subtle, it's not nothing, you know, strenuous --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just real subtle.  I keep it on, walk around the house.  When I'm in the mood I throw my legs up for five, six minutes, let it down, go the other side.
R:  Oh, mhm.
L:  And I do eat healthy. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, uh, well, as I said, my husband and I do a lot of walking and I, myself, do a lot of walking, um, just basically -- and even when I'm out shopping I will park, uh, my car further away than what I need to just so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that I get that extra walk. [MN] I'm diabetic so I really need to exercise and I need to keep my weight down.  Unfortunately I'm not a very good eater but, um, I still try [LAUGH] and manage it.  So ...
L:  What state your in?
R:  I live in Canada.
L:  Oh, Canada.
R:  Yeah, Vancouver, BC.
L:  Oh, I'm in New York.
R:  Oh, you're in New York.
L:  Yes.
R:  We've only passed through, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the state we actually never have stopped in New York City.  I would love to one day though.
L:  You say diabetic.  You know, string beans will help.
R:  Why is that?
L:  If you do a lot of -- string beans will help you with your diabetes.
R:  Oh, why is that?
L:  Yeah, I don't know but my mom have it and I give her string bean at least twice a week and her blood sugar went below one hundred.
R:  Really?
L:  I don't know why.  You gotta not eat corn.  Corn will rise it up.
R:  And I love corn.
L:  Yep, but you gotta cut out the corn, oh yes.  String beans and probably broccoli and cabbage, those three.
R:  Yeah, I like -- I like broccoli, um --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, but you gotta give up the corn.  The corn makes a lot of sugar.
R:  Oh, I love my corn on the cob.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, the cob.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, roasted.
R:  [NOISE] It's not as bad on the cob?
L:  No, it's not as bad on the cob because the one in the can they actually add sugar to that.
R:  Oh, I don't really like the, um, the canned -- canned vegetables anyway.  I don't find them to be as healthy as a fresh vegetable.  Uh, usually I buy the corn on the cob and then I, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- freeze it.
L:  Oh.
R:  And then use it, uh, for the winter.  So ...
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  This is kind of a neat program, isn't it? [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, they give you very diff- -- I got one the other day what would you do with a million dollars --
R:  Oh, I wish --
L:  -- if you didn't have to come back to the US.
R:  I wish I could do that one.
L:  Oh, that -- that was -- was very nice [LAUGH] one.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I got a lady from Massachusetts and -- and she -- we had a good conversation.  I -- I just noticed it in the paper but at first I thought --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it was just for men so I didn't bother with it and then I called and they said, "Yeah, ladies can do too" [NOISE] so ...
R:  Oh, yeah, I --
L:  You're about my -- my six -- or six- sixth person I have.
R:  Oh, you've done six calls?
L:  Yeah, I did -- six calls, yes, I just started last -- last week, the twenty third, June twenty third I start.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah, and I have six calls already [NOISE] very interesting.  But I usually, like, take them before I go to sleep because I can't -- I come from work in the morning --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I can't sleep so I was, like, "Let me trying something to do". [NOISE] 
R:  What --
L:  I really somebody to talk sometime and then they give you a topic to talk about.
R:  Yeah, what do you do for a living?
L:  [NOISE] I work at a post office.  I'm a mail handler.
R:  Oh, okay, well -- yeah.
L:  Yeah, so I -- I do the night shifts.
R:  Mhm, I do merchandising.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And that's where I actually found this -- this, um, number was, um, I log onto, um, Delphi Forum and they were talking about this Fisher study and so I thought, "Oh, I should try it" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because I enjoy talking.
L:  Yes.  I -- I -- I find that's -- when I find somebody to talk I feel much better, you know, about any kind of subject.
R:  Oh, yeah, so do you like --
L:  So, when did you know you have diabetes?
R:  I actually found out five years ago --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, I didn't really know that I had diabetes, um --
L:  About what age group you in?
R:  Uh, I'm in my fifties.
L:  Yeah, 'cause my mom got it when she was fifty seven.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  No, I was a little bit younger than that.
L:  Oh.
R:  But, um, I actually found out by accident.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  My cousin is diabetic and she, uh, does her blood sugar all the time --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and one day I said, "Ugh, that must hurt" and she said, "Actually you get used to it, let me try it".
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And I said, "No, you're not [LAUGH] pricking me with that thing". 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And she says, "No, it really doesn't hurt, try it". [LIPSMACK] So, I let her --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- try it and then she took my sugar and she said, "Oh my heavens, Bernice" she said, "You are fifteen".  I said, "Is that good?"  She said, "Good, you're supposed to be at six, that's normal".
L:  Oh. [NOISE]
R:  And so when I came home I went to my doctor and I told him that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, my cousin had taken by my blood sugar and he then sent me off to the lab and did the tests and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it came back that I was, um, type two diabetes.
L:  Wow.
R:  I only take pills.  I maintain pretty good --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, I take a half in the morning --
L:  So, they catch it in the early stage?
R:  -- and half at night.  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, I'm -- I guess, I'm very fortunate that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that I was, you know, uh, was able to have her, uh, check me like that [NOISE] otherwise --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, it's funny 'cause I used to shake when I get hungry --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I didn't know why in the world -- why am I shaking like this, you know, I felt like my whole body was vibrating --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and, um, so finally I -- now I know why.  Um, it was just because I -- when I di- wouldn't eat --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, that of course my -- my blood sugar must have been --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- extremely high and -- to making me feel that way.  So, that's why I exercise at night.  I also have, um, arthritis and I find that by doing stretching exercises to stretch the muscles before I go to bed, uh, when I wake up I am not in pain.  Ususally when I wake up I'm in a lot of pain because my muscles tense while I sleep.
L:  Mm.
R:  And so I gotta keep them constantly stretched.
L:  Well, for the last twenty years I've been watching what I eat, do my exercise, I do yoga, calisthenics, pilates, Tai Bo, anything new thing that come in just to keep my body in motion and watch what I eat. [LIPSMACK] And don't let anybody feed me their food because their food always make me sick so I just stay to mine.  I do a lot of walking and I drink a lot of water.
R:  That's something I need to do, yeah.
L:  I make -- I make -- I make -- I -- I got me Poland Spring home delivery's cheaper.  The -- the bottle you bought outside for a dollar twenty five, home deliver is fifty cents, you pay for the bottle.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, I get home delivery, you know, the sixteen ounce bottle --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I walk with two every day and I make sure I drink that.
R:  Oh.
L:  On my own and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- plus sometime I have at work.  But at least thirty two ounces every day.  Just make sure you just take a mouthful, you don't have to drink a whole cup one time.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Just take -- you take a mouthful and go about your business.  Try to take a mouthful, like, every two hours --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and you'll be all right.
R:  Yeah, I -- I need to get into a better regimen of, um, of using that because I don't drink enough water. 
L:  Oh.
R:  In the morning when I take all my vitamins I usually have one --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- large glass and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then in the afternoon I maybe have another glass to go with my medication and then at night --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- one glass and I know I need to do better than that.
L:  Yeah, try to take a mouthful, like, every hour and you -- you get into the habit.  Just a mouthful, no more than that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Just put -- just enough to give you a mouthful and swallow it.  And if you do that every hour you get into the habit.
R:  Mm.
L:  Get into a habit and then you actually miss not drinking the water, you know.
R:  Well, maybe I ought, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- give that a try.  I filter tap water because we have actually good water --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- um, because we live -- like the mountains are -- are very --
L:  Oh yes.
R:  -- close to us so we get, like --
L:  Okay, yes --
R:  -- molten water.
L:  -- that's -- that's good water, right.
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  That's good water.
R:  [LIPSMACK] So, we're very fortunate.  Have you ever been here?
L:  No.
R:  Oh.
L:  I'm planning to -- um, I have six more years to leave work --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I'm planning to travel.
R:  Good girl.
L:  I said, "I am not going to stay home" because I got in the habit of getting up every morning and every morning I'm gonna get up and travel.
R:  Well, whe- --
L:  So, probably stay one place three days at the most.
R:  Mhm.  We get the Olympics, um, the Winter Olympics in Vancouver in the year two thousand and ten.
L:  Oh yes, I'll be retiring by then.  I'll be --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- up there.
R:  Then you need to come here and -- and, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I -- I don't know if we're allowed to give each other information but, uh, you could always look me up.
L:  Mm.
R:  It would be, uh -- it would be nice to actually meet you in person.
L:  Oh [NOISE].
R:  But that's quite a few -- we might talk to each other again.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, and your name is?
R:  Bernice.
L:  Bernice.  And you from Canada.
R:  Mhm, Vancouver.  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, you would love it here.
L:  Yeah, I'm writing down whoever -- who I talk to and the day I talk to and what was the topic.  I know they give us ten minutes to talk but that's still good.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because, like, all my friends they just gone off the deep end [NOISE] sometime I don't have nobody to talk to.  All I have is my TV and I watch a lot of movies.  I watch a lot of exercise ...
