R:  [NOISE] Hello.
L:  Hello.  Hello.
R:  Hi, I'm Mary, who --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- are you?
L:  [LIPSMACK] My name is Amy.
R:  [NOISE] Okay.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh, where are you calling from?
L:  [SIGH] Kansas City.
R:  Oh, I'm in Connecticut.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, cool.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  N- not too cool here, though.
L:  Oh, yeah, [NOISE] yeah, I know.  It's summer, it's horrible.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] So [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE] What do you --
L:  -- d- do you want to start?
R:  [NOISE] Okay, um, [SIGH] it all went so fast and so unexpected, you know --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I didn't --
L:  I understand.
R:  [SIGH] I didn't -- I have never had this call before, I don't know if you have or not.
L:  No, this is my first one.
R:  Yeah, mine too, I just signed up for it. [SIGH] But anyway, um, [SIGH] I don't know, I don't think people should tell you what to read. [NOISE] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] I totally agree with that.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH] I totally agree that, um, no one should interfere--
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- with what anyone reads. [SIGH] I mean, there's age appropriate material --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- of course, for the kids and everything --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- but to ban, like, books like Tom Sawyer or Huck Finn or stuff like that I don't think is [SIGH] appropriate. [NOISE] [SIGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Well, I think, uh, at a young age it's up to the parents to see what their children are reading.
L:  Exactly, I agree with that.
R:  [MN] And, uh, [NOISE] if they don't agree with what the school [LIPSMACK] says then --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [NOISE] [MN] --
L:  Then they can take the appropriate actions.
R:  Right. [NOISE] 
L:  Right. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, my children are grown, so I don't have that problem --
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  -- and I read what I like [NOISE] and I hope they'll always have the privilege of reading what they --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- like to read. [NOISE] 
L:  I agree with that. [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] Well, I mean, my child is very young, but, you know, we [NOISE] --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- we read to her age appropriate material. [SIGH] I mean, we're not -- [SIGH] I -- [SIGH] no, I think the topics of [SIGH] sexual orientation and stuff like that which are out in the school libraries right now, those are --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- questionable. [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I mean from a moral standpoint.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  But --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] I would like to have [NOISE] an open relationship wi- with my daughter and explain --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- to her why people write those things --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and stuff like that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- but [SIGH] for the schools to --
R:  [SIGH] [NOISE] 
L:  -- ban that, [SIGH] I mean, that's kind of questionable right there. I don't think they should ban it [NOISE] at all.
R:  No, well, I don't think so either. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] So 
R:  Um, [NOISE] and I hope they never do. [SIGH] But they have in -- in our area --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- at times had books that people have complained about, or parents have complained about and there's been a big controversy over it.
L:  Mm.
R:  But, uh --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, like, what's out right now is --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I guess the biggest thing would be the Harry Potter stuff.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I don't know if you've read any of that, but [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] I think that's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] I personally read it because I don't go with other people's opinions, I want to form my own and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I think it's a bunch of, [SIGH] um, childhood fantasy --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- stuff.  I think it's wonderful for kids --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and again I would like to sit down with my daughter and explain to her, [SIGH] you know --
R:  Well, I've never read them --
L:  -- what's going on.
R:  -- but I know my daughter h-
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um, I have three granddaughters --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and my daughter has --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- her children reading --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- them. [NOISE] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And she's very, [LIPSMACK] um -- [SIGH] she -- my daughter has always been very good about reading to the kids and [SIGH] she certainly has always attempted to, um, encourage them to read, and I think that's very important too.
L:  Yes, I do too.
R:  Not only what they're [NOISE] reading but [LIPSMACK] how much they're reading.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] I agree with that.
R:  [NOISE] And, uh --
L:  [LIPSMACK] I mean, they're --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- I mean, like I said, there are some things that are questionable, but [SIGH] when the -- I believe when the media makes a -- [SIGH] a hoopla over stuff, you need to --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- you deserve it to yourself to -- to make your [NOISE] own opinion.
R:  Mhm.  Well, that's -- that's right. [MN] And I think sometimes --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the more the media pushes it, the more --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- people become curious --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and -- and read it and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and the kids are the same way.
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] And then everybody makes a whole bunch of money and then everyone's happy.
R:  Yes, that's right.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] The more they push it, the more [SIGH] publicity they get on it then everybody wants to read it.
L:  Yeah. [LIPSMACK] that's true. [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  And I don't think a lot of people understand that's what's happening.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I think they go about their lives --
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] 
L:  -- [NOISE] not thinking about that sort of thing.
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] 
L:  [NOISE] So --
R:  Well, how old is your daughter?
L:  She's three.
R:  Three?
L:  Mhm.  She's a young three. [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] A young three, well, [SIGH] you have a lot of censor- censoring to do then. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right. [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] But lets --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] [NOISE] hope that they, uh, don't censor things too much. [NOISE] No, I haven't read the Harry B- Potter books, but, um, [NOISE] they're certainly popular, so [NOISE] I can't see what [NOISE] the hoopla's about. 
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] Well, I mean, if you like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- if you like fiction, I'd go ahead and read it.
R:  [MN] Well.
L:  They're interesting.  They kept my interest, so 
R:  [NOISE] Are you a reader.
L:  I'm a big reader.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] Yeah, my husband and I are both --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- book people. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes, I was just reading a book when you called. [MN] 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN] [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, I was reading the paper. [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  So --
R:  [NOISE] Well.
L:  Yeah, and we're big people on not --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- not letting other people tell us what to do or what --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- not to do.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] We like to make our own opinions --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- so [SIGH] [MN] --
R:  [SIGH] Well, I think it's very important to read [NOISE] fiction and non fiction [NOISE] and [NOISE] [MN] certainly it's, uh [NOISE] good for the children to read.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I always felt it has been [NOISE] so important for them, even if they just read comic books. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] Definitely. [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  We have a lot of those in the house, too.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] But we have a whole bunch of everything.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  And we like to -- we like to encourage thinking for ourselves, so I think if [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I think that people censoring things --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, uh, teaches -- teaches what I don't want my child to understand.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] I want her to think for herself --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] and f- to form her own opinions --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and if she doesn't like it then she doesn't have to read any more of it.
R:  [NOISE]  
L:  [SIGH] So -- but definitely I think the parents --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- should do the --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- the monitoring of the censoring and the school shouldn't censor at all.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] But that's just my opinion.
R:  [NOISE] Well, there's so much out there for the kids now, with the computers and everything --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they can get into. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] It's, uh, really hard to monitor everything, I know.
L:  Definitely.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  It's, uh, definitely more than a full time job [LAUGH] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- watching what they intake all the time.
R:  [NOISE] Now, do you work too?
L:  No, I don't.
R:  Oh, that's good. [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] I can't -- [SIGH] the monotony gets to me, but I can't stand to w- to be away from my baby.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] It's a horrible catch twenty two. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, [NOISE] it's, uh, [NOISE] good to do both if you can, but [NOISE] it's all right if you can't. [NOISE] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  They grow so fast, it's best if you don't have to. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they do, you're never going to get that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- time back.
R:  That's right. [NOISE] And do you read a lot to her?  Does she like to be read to?
L:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] Oh, she loves being read to.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] I wish I read more --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- to her, but --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] I just --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the days go by so fast and then it's time for bed.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] It's horrible how the time flies. [SIGH] 
R:  [NOISE] Oh. Wait till you get to be my age. [LAUGH] 
L:  Mm. [NOISE] 
R:  You'll wonder where all the years have gone. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  So. [NOISE] 
L:  Wow. [SIGH] My friend was Mary, and she's the one --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that signed me up for this thing --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] so, and she thought, "Oh, it wasn't that interesting, we might talk to each other tonight" then he said your name was Mary. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  And your name again was?
L:  Amy.
R:  Amy.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  So --
R:  So, well, it's nice talking to you Amy.
L:  Yes.
R:  And, um, maybe next time I'll [LIPSMACK] catch what they want me to talk about a little bit better.
L:  [MN] [NOISE] Well, I know --
R:  So I won't be --
L:  -- um, [LIPSMACK] all I know is that they said to me --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that it was should schools --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- censor reading material --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- for the children.  Maybe it wasn't even reading, but material.
R:  Right. [NOISE] 
L:  So, and it was fast, I only signed up--
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, six, seven hours ago.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  [MN] 
R:  Well, I did last night, I think. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um [NOISE] --
L:  So, it's coming when?
R:  But, uh, [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] I thought, "Well, maybe they wouldn't even call".
L:  Right.
R:  And then [NOISE] there was --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- so many different things that they --
