R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello?
R:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK]  Hello.  Hi, my name is Deitra.  [SIGH]
L:  Hi, I'm Rosanna.  I -- I'm calling -- um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [MN] from New Jersey.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] [NOISE]  Yeah, I can tell by your voice.  [SIGH]  I'm fro --
L:  Ah, where are you from?
R:  [NOISE]-- I'm -- I'm, um, [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] I'm from the East Coast but I live -- [NOISE] I live in San Francisco.  [NOISE]
L:  Oh!
R:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, that's interesting.  [SIGH]
R:  But I -- I'm a -- I -- I grew up in, um, Connecticut [NOISE] and I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I used to have fam- -- family in N- New Jersey.  So, [SIGH] I picked it right up when you -- with your accent.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I do have an accent, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that's i- [LAUGH] interesting.  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Listen, um, [LIPSMACK] did -- did -- w- would you like to speak first?  [NOISE]
L:  Um, --
R:  Did you hear the --
L:  -- it doesn't matter to me.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I -- I -- it doesn't matter --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you could go.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It doesn't matter.
R:  [SIGH]  Okay, um, [LIPSMACK] well, um, [MN] I'm a retired dancer --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and so, um, I spent many, many years ... d- dancing for my living, [SIGH] and it was my [NOISE] whole life.  [SIGH]  And then in the early nineties, [SIGH] um, [LIPSMACK] you know, my grandfather passed away [NOISE] and I got very depressed for some reason and I [SIGH] -- I stopped exercising, [NOISE] you know, like taking classes.  'Cause I mean, I retired in the eighties but [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, I -- [NOISE] I -- I continued to exercise till the early nineties [SIGH] [NOISE] and, um, [MN] I got really depressed because, um, I got a lump in my breast --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- and it -- it, um, that -- that really affected [SIGH] the way my body looked 'cause, [NOISE] you know, as a dancer [SIGH] you're usually small breasted.  [NOISE]
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH]  S- so, anyway, um, [NOISE] [MN] -- I, um, actually went to, -- um, I went to New York [NOISE] to visit somebody and I -- it was on vacation and I drank -- I was drinking a lot of coffee [SIGH] [NOISE] and that's w- what stimulated, um, [NOISE] the breast problem.  [NOISE]  And [SIGH] luckily it was benign and, you know, I didn't have cancer [NOISE] [SIGH] but I can't --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- drink coffee.  And, um, [LIPSMACK] what happened was the bre- -- the breast blew up, kind of, like, balloons and it was very, very scary to be, [SIGH] you know, [NOISE] ah, v- visiting somebody and have this trauma ha- -- take place.  [NOISE]  So, [SIGH] --
L:  Do you really think it was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the coffee that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- stimulated it?
R:  [NOISE]  Oh, definitely.
L:  Oh.
R:  Because I -- I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- don't drink coffee and, um, she had a lot -- one of those cappuccino machines she just --
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  -- bought.
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH]  And that was back [SIGH] years ago when, you know, n- not too many people had [NOISE] cap- ah, cappuccino machines because they were expensive.  [SIGH]
L:  Um, right.
R:  And they were just coming on the market and they were ... a couple a hundred dollars.  [SIGH]
L:  Right.
R:  So, you know, it was like a big novelty to have one and I was, -- you know, just having a good time drinking all this, [SIGH] you know, heavy, ... s- strong, ah, lattes and whatever.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
R:  So, anyway, you know, that was -- the doctor's first thing was, "Well, what did you do different?"  [NOISE]  But anyway, [SIGH] -- so, anyway, my breast, -- [NOISE] um, one breast got bigger than the other and consequently [SIGH] ... it turned me off to exercise because I got really d- depressed about the way, ... my breasts were looking.
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH]  And, um, [MN] I have never, -- ah, well, one time I did -- matter of fact, today [SIGH] I just went to the, ah, YMCA 'cause it's not far from where I live.
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH]  And I just got the papers, um, [MN] to fill out because I want to join.  So, it's --
L:  Well, you know, we have a lot --
R:  -- really funny.
L:  -- in common.  I don't know old you are but, um, [LIPSMACK]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I used to exercise a lot too.
R:  [SIGH]  I'm in my -- I'm, ah, fifty- -- I'm going to be fifty f- four in October.  [NOISE]
L:  You don't sound it at all.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You sound like you're eighteen years old.  So, [LAUGH] --
R:  [NOISE]  Right.
L:  -- I'm -- [SIGH] I just turned fifty.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] and, um, --
R:  You don't sound it either.  [NOISE]
L:  Ah, my father passed away.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I got very, very, very --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- depressed and, um, --
R:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
L:  -- [NOISE] because --
R:  How long ago?  [NOISE]
L:  Six years ago.  He had a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- stroke and he passed --
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah, my m- mother had two mini strokes and she's --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- not -- she's a totally different person.  I mean, once they have that stroke [SIGH] you can -- you can forget the -- the person you know.  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, but --
R:  They're not the same people.  [NOISE]
L:  I know.  I know.  [NOISE]  Well, he passed away.  He had a major one.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  He had two, the o- -- the first one and then the second --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- one was major and he was in a hospital for months --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and months and months.  [SIGH]  And my --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- life changed --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- right after that 'cause I was work- --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I was working -- actually, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you were a dancer but I was in --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- advertising [SIGH] and I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- worked for many years, twenty three --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- years and I had to give it up because I was too stressed out.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I have a son --
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
L:  -- [SIGH] and we had just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- moved and my job --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- was, like, even on weekends --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they were calling me and calling me.
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
L:  So, [SIGH] [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]  What part of New Jersey?  I'm curious.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] by the Meadowlands.  Do you know where --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Giant Stadium -- do you know where that is?  [NOISE]
R:  W- what's the name of the town?
L:  Well, I'm, ah, closer to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Wayne, which is very --
R:  I know, yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, my cousin, um, [LIPSMACK] -- my cousin used to live in, um, Englewood Cliffs.  [NOISE]
L:  Okay, that's pretty.
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  That's really nice.  [NOISE]  Well, I live --
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  -- in this little town called --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Cedar Grove.
R:  [NOISE]  What is it?
L:  Cedar Grove.
R:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  I don't know.
L:  It's very pretty.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  It's really small.
R:  [SIGH]  Do you know Butler, New Jersey?
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  My cousin lives there.  [NOISE]
L:  Uh-hum.  I know Butler.  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]  My cousin who lives in, um, -- who used to live in Englewood Cliffs [NOISE] [SIGH] now, um, [NOISE] has a house in Butler.  I don't like -- I don't think Butler's too hot.  [NOISE]
L:  Um, we don't go there often [NOISE] but I know exactly where it is.
R:  [NOISE]  I -- I've --
L:  [SIGH]  But anyway I had a lump in my breast too.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And I -- I -- I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, -- I -- you wouldn't believe I had so many different stories --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- with that because just, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, last year, after the lump --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- then I found out --
R:   [NOISE]
L:  -- everything was okay --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but then [NOISE] I went for a mammography and they found --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- another lump and they told me it was c- cancer --
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
L:  -- and I went through hell.  Ended up that the X Ray was taken wrong --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so I went through six months of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] going through, ah, doctors and doctors.  It cost me over a thousand dollars.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I had three breast surgeons, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and two radiologists --
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.
L:  -- look at the X Rays.  [SIGH]  So, it's very frightening --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and very scary and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] I -- I just try to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- stay active and it's funny --
R:  [NOISE]  Let me ask you, um, are we going off the subject matter because they said if we go off the subject matter we won't get paid, 'cause --
L:  Oh, I don't know but [NOISE] let's -- I'll go back to --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- exercising.
R:  [LAUGH]  Oh, no, because she just told me if you -- if you go off the subject matter too much [SIGH] they won't pay us for it.
L:  Oh, okay.  [NOISE]
R:  So, I don't -- this is my third time doing it and [SIGH] --
L:  Oh, this is my third time [NOISE] as well.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  This is my t- [LAUGH] third.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my God, [SIGH] but anyway the funniest thing is I just went back [NOISE] to exercising a -- a m- month ago.  They have this place called Fighting and Fitness --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and the woman was telling me that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that you really need to exercise or your muscles get at- -- +atrophy atrophy.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  You know, [SIGH] which means that they s- shrink.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  And, um, --
R:  Oh, my God.  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't want to start doing that.  So, I --
R:  -- I have a life time membership to Bally's [NOISE] and I'm going to have to --
R:  I know Bally's.  I think I've seen it on the East Coast.  It's a --
L:  They have a lot of advertisements --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I think [NOISE] it's the healthiest --
R:  It's -- it's Bally's right --
L:  -- thing to do.
R:  -- with a B?
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.  And I went there --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I went -- well I have a life time to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Bally's but this other place that I tried the other day --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- was closer to home --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and it's called Platinum Fitness and I went through the, ah, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- f- forty five minute segment with the woman.  She's a personal trainer.  [NOISE]
R:  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  And the next day I felt --
R:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
L:  -- I felt fantastic.
R:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
L:  I can't tell you and so --
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- [SIGH] I'm going through menopause right now.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, I really need --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to do something 'cause I -- I -- you know I'm just like -- I can't sleep at nights, I'm getting the night sweats and everything, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I'm getting -- my bones are feeling --
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Well, you know, --
L:  -- weak 'cause I have a little bit of osteo.
R:  -- I -- I'm not having that problem and I -- I'm older than you.  And the reason is this.  I've been vegetarian most of my life.  [SIGH]
L:  Good for you.
R:  [SIGH]  And I eat --
L:  [NOISE]  Lots of soy.
R:  -- lots of soy.  [SIGH]  One thing I h- have to say about mo- -- living t- -- in California it's really [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- changed my whole ... attitude on life.  [SIGH]
L:  Very healthy, right?  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Yep.  Yep.  I eat soy all the ti- time.  I eat health food.  I mean, like, I've been drinking lots of carrot juice the last couple of days.  D- did you ever hear of Odwalla juice?
L:  [NOISE]  N- n- no.  [NOISE]
R:  I don't think it's on the east coast.  Well, Odwalla juice is like a real [SIGH] health, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, it's in all the health food stores and it's really --
L:  It's called, Odwalla?
R:  -- big out here.  It's called Odwalla.  [SIGH]  And they make these incredible juices.  They're expensive but [SIGH] they, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, sometimes, [MN], um, there's a lot of food programs in San Francisco.  They g- give away a lot of food [NOISE] and I just started finding out about 'em.  And I though well w- why should I spend money on food if I can [SIGH] get food for free.  [SIGH]  And they were giving away Odwalla -- they give away Odwalla juice and, [NOISE] like, maybe it's a couple of days outdated, you know, that you have to drink it with, -- like, within in the week.  [SIGH]  And they, -- you know, they can't sell that s- stuff so they give it away.  And this -- [SIGH] this Odwalla juice i- is really expensive 'cause it's like half a gallon.  [SIGH]  So, they gave me two half gallons of carrot juice and I am so sick of it.  Yesterday I ate -- drank --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- a whole [SIGH] half gallon of carrot juice.
L:  But that must be very healthy for you?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But I guess in moderation, right?
R:  Well, the thing is I -- I have no room in my refrigerator 'cause I -- I gets -- I -- I have so much food that I have no room, and so [SIGH] I can't put the -- the juice -- so I'm keeping it by the window, you know, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- 'cause it -- it's chilly at night.  But, [SIGH] you know, it's gonna go bad in a, -- you know, if I don't drink it up by tomorrow, you know, I -- 'cause I definitely don't want to get sick.  You have to be very careful with [SIGH] -- when you don't refrigerate something, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, it doesn't last as long.
L:  [NOISE]  Oh!
R:  [SIGH]  So, anyway, back to this -- the f- fitness thing.  I haven't really taken, um, ex --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't know -- I haven't -- I joined the gym for about [SIGH] six months, ah, about six months and I was going and then, um, I stopped.  [SIGH]  And I'll tell you, you know, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I've put on about twenty five pounds.
L:  Oh, God.  I've --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- gained -- I've gained, like, fifteen myself through this menopausal --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- s- stuff.  And I [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's all round the middle.
R:  [NOISE]  Ye- --
L:  It's all around the middle.
R:  -- yep.  [NOISE]
L:  And, ah, they were telling me that even if I do crunches [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that it's not gonna [NOISE] really be effective because what happens --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is [SIGH] the muscle grows behind the fat.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Now, you have a layer of m- muscle --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and a layer of fat.
R:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
L:  So, the best thing to do is [NOISE] -- you only have to do --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the only fat burning thing is c- cardio, [SIGH] which burns it all over.
R:  [NOISE]  M- m- m- m-.
L:  So, that's what I'm t- trying [NOISE] to do.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  But it's hard --
R:  [SIGH]  [MN]  Well, I -- you know --
L:  -- 'cause I have two kids that are still young.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  My -- my son's fourteen and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- my daughter -- I just adopted a little girl --
R:  [NOISE]
L: -- from Romania.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, it's hard.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  It -- it's -- it's tough, you know, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- because --
R:  [SIGH]  And your -- and your son is fourteen?  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Why did you adopt 'cause you don't -- at your age you didn't want to have another one?
L:  Well, I had tried for ten years but going back to the [SIGH] health issue I [SIGH] -- you know my father died, I went through a lot of period of stress and I developed, like, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a thyroid problem and I was infertile, which I didn't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- even realize but --
R:  You was, what -- what's inf- --
L:  I was infertile.  [SIGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  So, I decided when I left the job because it was too stressful I [SIGH] ... went and got her and it's the most meaningful thing --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in my life, [NOISE] I mean, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
L:  -- I just ... adore her.  You know, she's --
R:  Well, you're fortunate that you, um, -- [SIGH] I'm single.  I've never been married.  No kids.  [SIGH]
