L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  My name is Susan.
L:  Hi, my name's Dan.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  How are you?
L:  [LAUGH] I'm all right, my voice is a little strained, I just got out of a, [LIPSMACK] uh, a voiceover gig, I'm a little goof- goofed up, here.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, doing the voice of a [MN] [inaudible] announcer and [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm just about done. [LAUGH]
R:  Ah. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, so [MN] the -- Susan?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you exercise regularly? [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, I do.
L:  Oh, good.
R:  How 'bout you?
L:  I'm actually on my way to the gym --
R:  Oh, right.
L:  -- right now.  Yeah, they close at eleven, though, so I don't know if I'm going to make it.
R:  Ah. [MN]
L:  But, I'm going to try to get there. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I exercise probably, well I go --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to the gym about three times a week and then I try to do some kind of exercise every day.
L:  [NOISE] That works --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- pretty good.  I'd actually just started up again about two months ago.  Um, I -- I used to be in pretty damn good shape in -- in high school and then I just kinda let myself --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- fly.
R:  Weren't we all at one time? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, right, exactly.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- uh, yeah, that -- I -- I -- I go pretty much, uh, I try to get outside at least, uh, two or three times a week doing biking or running or something --
R:  Yeah, I'm not --
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] and so --
R:  -- I used to be a runner, I'm not much of a runner any more.  I know I [LAUGH] -- now I don't ever know it -- don't know why I ever tortured my body with that, but -- [LAUGH]
L:  But yeah, it -- it's -- it's kind of a pain --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- sometimes, it's --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- [MN] easy -- easy to get difficult on the shins, so [MN] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- kind of a mess, so -- when did you start working out?
R:  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- let's -- well, I -- I worked out a lot when I was younger and then I just started again about a year ago.
L:  Oh yeah?
R:  Going to the gym on a regular basis.
L:  [NOISE] Was there anything that -- that made you want to start?
R:  Um, having four kids pretty close together and [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, well that would --
R:  -- always --
L:  -- do it, huh?
R:  -- gets you out of shape pretty quick.
L:  Wow, does it, uh, help relieve some stress a little bit, or --
R:  Yeah, it does quite a bit, actually.
L:  Yeah.  How old are your kids?
R:  They are nine, seven, five and four.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That sounds like a -- yeah, actually --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I work at a group home with, uh, nine to thirteen year olds, so --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, I -- I -- I know how difficult some of those -- some of those ages can be.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  At least the nine year old, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so.  Yeah --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that's -- that's kind of a mess.
R:  Huh.
L:  But, uh, so we -- we try to keep pretty [NOISE] consistent, uh, disciplinary measures and stuff and these kids fly off the handle with the hint of something's unfair and, you know --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's a mess.  But, wow. [LIPSMACK] So where are you -- where are you talking from?
R:  Minnesota.  How 'bout--
L:  No kidding?
R:  -- you?
L:  Uh, I'm -- I'm in Chicago.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Not too --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- far away.
L:  No, I'm in a -- in a whole --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- load of traffic. [MN]
R:  Oh, and that's fun. [MN]
L:  No, not too good, so, [MN] uh, what are you up to in -- in Minnesota?
R:  [SIGH] Not much --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- of anything.  Trying to --
L:  Staying with the kids, ay?
R:  Yeah, trying to get them to go to bed and [LAUGH] --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- playing on the Internet.
L:  Yeah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- not a bad idea.
R:  Uh --
L:  That's -- that works.  So what do you -- what do you do at the gym there, Susan?  Y- you do the, uh, you do the cardio and all the -- the weights as well?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Nice.  I try to get going myself on all that stuff.  I actually just joined the -- a gym yesterday, um --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, um, yeah -- yeah, I joined the Bally's, I -- I didn't want to go, 'cause I figured there'd be a whole bunch of meat heads out there and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I didn't wanna be part of that but, um, [MN] I -- I just joined under my sister's account and it -- it was cheaper, so I was, like, "Well --"
R:  Oh. [NOISE]
L:  "-- whatever". [MN] So, I tried buying my own weights and -- and working out at home and it just wasn't working, I --
R:  I pu-
L:  -- don't know.
R:  We did that --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- for a while, we had a [MN] -- a pretty nice weight room going on down in our basement, but then, uh, after a heavy rain one -- one spring our basement got flooded, so there went our weight room. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, is that right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh --
R:  And so --
L:  -- that's awful.
R:  -- so, yeah, so then our -- our weight training kinda went s- [LAUGH]
L:  Went south with the water.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  So -- well, that's too bad.  Well --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it sounds like you got your own regimen picked back up again. [MN]
R:  Yeah, for the most part, I'd --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I seemed to better in the winter 'cause then I can -- I go to the gym and then I ski a lot in the winter, so that --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, right.
R:  -- I actually stay in better shape during the winter than I do in the summer.
L:  No kidding?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] Is that, uh, cross country?
R:  Um, I do both cross country and downhill.
L:  Oh, where -- where do you go downhill then?  I- is there somewhere a- around there to go skiing?  I don't really --
R:  Oh yeah, there's a lot of places up here.  I mean they're --
L:  No kidding?
R:  -- [LAUGH] --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- not mountains by any means, but --
L:  Never really --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- knew Minnesota had a -- had a downhill.
R:  Yeah, I'm right around the twin cities area and there's quite a few -- quite a few ski areas.
L:  Okay.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I was there, I think it -- yeah, I was in Minnesota, like, two years ago, Minneapolis, I was in --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's pretty -- it's pretty impressive, the city is very clean and kinda futuristic looking, I was kinda --
R:  Yeah it's --
L:  -- I was -- I was impressed by it.
R:  -- for the most part it's a pretty nice, clean city.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- mm, ha, about forty five minutes north of the city and kind of, oh, hah, supposedly out in the country but it's getting to be [LAUGH] --
L:  It's getting to be --
R:  -- [inaudible] --
L:  -- the city anyway.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I know how that is --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- so.  The big, uh, big sprawl.
R:  Yep. [LAUGH]
L:  That's how things [SIGH] seem to work.  So, are you still married?
R:  [NOISE] Yep.
L:  Great.  Where --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- where'd you meet your husband at?  I just have to ask --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [inaudible].
R:  Oh, we met skiing, actually.
L:  No kidding?
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's great, on the -- on the same chair or something like that?
R:  [LAUGH] He was on the ski patrol and I wa- I just skied every day and he chased --
L:  Oh, okay --
R:  -- me around for --
L:  -- so you [NOISE] --
R:  -- he chased me --
L:  -- so you --
R:  -- around and got on my nerves for a couple of years and then we [LAUGH] -- and then I finally --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- gave him a chance. [LAUGH]
L:  That's fantastic.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's great.  So you didn't fall and break something and he was not, like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- coming to your aid and --
R:  No.
L:  -- he just was chasing you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's --
R:  No, we ended up --
L:  -- that's sweet.
R:  -- yeah.  Then we ended up on the same -- we both race and we ended up on the same ski team too, so --
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Mm, ski racers.
R:  Yep.
L:  Well, Susan I have no exciting story for you like that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I'm sorry.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I -- I -- I don't have anything --
R:  [LAUGH] Well, believe me --
L:  -- remotely --
R:  -- we're not great or anything.
L:  Yeah, well no --
R:  You aren't going to see us --
L:  -- of course you --
R:  -- in the Olympics any time soon.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, that's a great story, though, come on --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- ski -- ski patrol and then chasing you on the skis, uh --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that's, like, that's movie material right there.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, not really. [LAUGH]
L:  No, come on --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you make your own movie.
R:  Yeah.
L:  At least you got to play it off like that to your kids, 'cause, you know, it --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- like, I -- "Your parents are -- are m- are film stars, look what we did". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  That's -- that's great.  That's fantastic.  So, y- you got, uh, your kids have any -- any hobbies or sports that they're into?  Are they skiers too?
R:  Yeah, they're all --
L:  Your children?
R:  -- into skiing and then [MN] and my daughter, [SIGH] she's nine, she's into running --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I didn't know that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, children get into running at that age, that's great.
R:  Uh, my husband's a runner so --
L:  Oh --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- okay.
R:  -- she --
L:  -- maybe that helps.
R:  -- she's Daddy's girl, so [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- whatever he does, she wants to do.
L:  She -- [MN] you -- your husband's a -- he's a marathoner? Yeah?
R:  Yep, he is.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah --
L:  I -- je- jeeze.
R:  -- insane. [LAUGH]
L:  That's incredible.  So he -- do- I mean, I heard about this -- that this is a problem, does he have nipple tape?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know --
R:  He --
L:  -- I --
R:  -- he wears --
L:  -- I --
R:  -- little round bandaids over his nipples.
L:  -- yeah --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that's -- oh, God, -- it's -- and so it's true.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  They keep on running and -- and -- [inaudible] -- because I have heard stories where, if you don't have it, you -- you can bleed and it's just --
R:  Ye- oh, yeah.
L:  -- dangerous and, oh jeeze --
R:  Yeah, it's a mess.
L:  [NOISE] All right, yeah.  Because I -- I'm -- I was building my stamina up, I -- I've just ran -- I got up to seven miles, but --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- yeah, I thought that was pretty good and -- and my nipples weren't sore, and I was, like, "What is this nipple tape?"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But I guess if you're up to, like, twenty three and a half or twenty six, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- maybe you need it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [NOISE] just a little bit.
R:  Well -- well that's pretty good if you can run seven miles, I don't think I could even run [LAUGH] --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- run a half a mile anymore.
L:  Yeah, I know --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- uh, jeeze, I -- I didn't think I'd be able to get up there either, but [MN] it -- it feels really good to actually --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- d- you know, get farther and, you know, you feel like you're accomplishing something and --
R:  Yeah, my goal --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- right now is my -- my kids run in a race every Fourth of July and it's just a two mile race for the kids, but I don't think I could even attempt to do a two miles right now because I haven't run in so many years, so my goal is to -- by next Fourth of July be able to run with the kids.
L:  Oh, great.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Sounds like a good goal.
R:  'Cause my four year old freaks out when I leave him at the starting line and [LAUGH] --
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "Mommy!"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "Gotta go". [LAUGH]
R:  Yep. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Oh, I like it, that's a -- that's a great idea.
R:  So, hopefully.
L:  Sounds wonderful.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  [MN]
L:  Anything, e- else they -- they do?  There's running, skiing, biking, boating, nagging? [NOISE]
R:  [MN] Well, they do it all, actually.
L:  Yeah.  [MN] Know exactly what --
R:  They're all --
L:  -- you're talking about, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's -- that's great.  So you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- are their -- you know what I -- I -- what I'm kinda cu- curious about is, I -- I -- I -- 'cause I really haven't spoken to too many people in your age group, 'cause I -- I just don't really socialize --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- with people who have kids and all and that stuff besides, you know, my parents and I -- I was kinda wondering do y- do you keep a base of -- of friends that you -- you've had around for a long time, or are you at the point now where you're kind of socializing with your -- your kids' parents and stuff like that?
R:  Um, it kinda goes both ways, you know, for -- [MN] when I just had one child it was probably easier to keep in touch with some of my single friends that didn't have kids --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but then it was, like, a- as I added kids to the mix more and more, then it, you know, you drift apart and you --
L:  Right.
R:  -- tend to gravitate towards people that have more in common with you.
L:  Okay, 'cause they, kind of, right, ki-
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- kind of understand where you're coming from and --
R:  Yeah.  But I guess I've never, I mean, I've had kids for nine years now and I guess I've never lost track of my -- my friends that don't have kids --
L:  Oh, that's --
R:  -- but we just --
L:  good then.
R:  -- yeah, we just don't get together as much as we used to and stuff.
L:  Okay.  It's only --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- yeah.  Do yo- do both you and your husband, you  -- grow up in Minneapolis ...
