L:  Hi.  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  This is Laura.
R:  Hi, I'm Charlene.
L:  Hi.  Are we supposed to start talking?
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Do you exercise?
L:  Yeah, I -- I guess I do by it's by default 'cause I -- I live in the city and I bike to work and I bike everywhere.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  So --
R:  I, um, I do most of my exercise at home.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I live in Florida and it's pretty hot out most of the time so I wasn't getting enough exercise trying to do that so I do some stuff at home.  I'm trying to lose some weight right now. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh yeah.  So, you -- do you, like, have a schedule or, like, do a certain amount, like do you have some, like, a kind of a plan?
R:  I try.  I try to do -- oh about four times a week I try to -- I have an elliptical trainer at home and so usually after work I watch some TV and do that and the time goes pretty fast.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So --
L:  I guess -- was the question whether we think it's important or just talk about it? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know.
L:  I don't -- yeah, I -- even though I say the question then I forget.
R:  I -- I just heard did we exercise.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I -- I think it's important.  Um --
L:  It's -- I'm always -- I -- I have to -- like I -- I can't say I, like, make a huge effort it just kinda happens --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because I -- you know, I'm either walking somewhere or I'm biking somewhere and there's just always, um -- it's just the way I get places --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- mostly 'cause I try not to drive my car in the city because it's just a pain to find parking and all that.
R:  Yeah.  I live in a pretty rural area so --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- we drive everywhere but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, you know, it -- it's nice out so it's -- it's nice to walk, I really like to walk --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, so sometimes I do it for exercise and do it regularly, the weather's just not always right for it and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- between the heat or rain or bugs [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.  Ooh. [LAUGH]
R:  -- it doesn't always work out.  Um --
L:  Yeah, but I definitely -- like even when I'm not making a point to it, like, even -- I get home from work and I've biked I just -- I feel so much better --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like all of your aggressions, if you like -- you know, like have anything --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- rough happen in the day or anything are just, like, gone by the time I've, like, biked all the way back home.
R:  Yeah, I find that too when I'm exercising regularly I feel better.  I have more energy --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, yeah, I just -- in a better mood, I guess.
L:  Do you usually do it right after work?
R:  Usually I come home and relax a little bit, have a little something to eat --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then -- then do it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So --
L:  So, like the evening -- the evening works for you?
R:  Yeah, I usually -- kinda early in the evening.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I've -- I've tried doing it in the morning before work and that never works out for me. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  At night it's si- I -- I go more time and I can find something on TV to watch while I do it and --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- so --
L:  Yeah, in the morning in it always feels like I'm --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, rushing and --
R:  Yeah, I feel like --
L:  -- there's just not --
R:  -- I'm dragging myself out of bed --
L:  -- time.
R:  -- and -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mm.  Mm, [LAUGH].
R:  Well, uh, I use some weights too, try to -- try to get a little strength, they say that's good for you too so --
L:  Oh yeah, so you're actually trying --
R:  Try to do that.
L:  -- build a little bit.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  That's good.  Yeah, I don't -- I don't know how I would do if I had to -- you know, uh, you know, if I lived in a place where exercise wasn't -- 'cause I think I'd have a really hard time, like, making a point of doing it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like if I was trying to, like, go jogging every day or, like --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- use some sort of equipment, like, I'm not -- I'm not [LAUGH] -- I guess you feel like you -- like, you feel the benefits so much that you find time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I just don't know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think I'd be bad at that. [LAUGH]
R:  And my day -- I -- I mean, I drive to work --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I -- I sit most of the day, you know --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- so at the end of the day you're -- i- it feels good be doing something.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  You know, if I was out and about and walking and moving around more maybe I wouldn't.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I mean, it'd be nice to [NOISE] be able to walk and do that stuff during the day but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah, that's just my job, is kind of --
L:  Sedentary.
R:  -- kind of stuck in one place [LAUGH] most of the time.
L:  Have you, like, been good about exercising for, like, years and years or is it, like, a new thing?
R:  Um, on and off.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  Um, for a while -- I'm kinda back into it recently --
L:  Uh-huh
R:  -- and I've gone back and forth, um, but years ago I was pretty good, I was always going to a gym but at that time I didn't need to lose weight.  I was just doing it --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- for -- I don't know, just for fun more --
L:  Start feel good and --
R:  -- than anything.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, but now I've, uh, put on a little weight so [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I have another purpose.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And besides it -- it's not just to lose weight for looks but just for health.
L:  Yeah, it's really --
R:  That's what I worry about.
L:  -- yeah, I've -- I've -- I've definitely gone through -- I -- I teach so much I was real active and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and up and around in and keeping [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- high school students interested, which is fairly -- it -- it can calisthenic practically.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH]
L:  But, um -- but there's definitely been times 'cause I've -- I've had situations where I was commuting where I -- I put on all sorts of weight --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- 'cause you're eating in the car and all that and I remember --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- like I -- yeah, before this current post I took when I commuted I just -- you know, I really -- when I took my current job where I can bike I -- I actually lost a  lot of weight just, like, really naturally just from, like, not driving and not eating in the car [LAUGH].
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  It's amazing, like, how hectic it gets when --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you're -- 'cause I had a long commute.  But, yeah.
R:  Yeah, I guess nowadays we don't -- don't do as much as we used to. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  People used to walk more and do more --
L:  I guess it's just harder to do --
R:  -- stuff physically --
L:  -- a lot of ordinary tasks --
R:  -- now everything's done for us so, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I try to do something- you know, I have a house and a yard so --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- I figure I get a little exercise out there trying to keep up with the yard now and then. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  So --
L:  Yeah, that --
R:  -- I do that, um --
L:  -- that makes sense.
R:  Yeah, we actually had a contest at work for a while where we were all keeping tr- we had team and we kept tracked of how many minutes we'd exercise each day.
L:  Oh yeah. [NOISE]
R:  And we'd compete week to week on who did more and --
L:  Wow, that's --
R:  -- so -- and it was --
L:  -- that's kinda cool.
R:  -- kinda to try to keep everyone motivated and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  An office I worked in had kinda like a gym club where they would, like, you know, all drag each other to gym at different times.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, and they'd keep each other on the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the bandwagon.
R:  Yeah, a friend of mine just opened a -- like a small gym, kinda like one of those Curves places, if you've --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- heard of those but, um, she's only open 'til seven o'clock at night right now and sometimes that's not [LAUGH] -- that's not --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- good for me so ...
L:  -- the thing is that's not late enough.
R:  So, I do it at home.
L:  Yeah.  I guess if you've got the -- you've got the stuff, you said you're using elliptical, what's that?
R:  Yeah, it's an elliptical trainer it's called.  It's, um, kinda like a stepper --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- but you go in more of a circular motion.  Almost like you're running but you're feet are on pedals so you're never -- you're never pounding, you're never making any impact.
L:  Are you sitting or are you standing?
R:  No, you're -- you're s- it's like you're pedaling while standing.
L:  Okay, but it's like supporting you around the -- the circle. [LAUGH]
R:  But you -- you know, you're standing up and it's -- I mean, it's comfortable and everything --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but it's -- it's kinda like similar to being on a treadmill but you've got pedals.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, it's -- it's not -- and you can go slow that's kinda like walking or you can speed up and go kinda like you're running.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  You can go whatever speed and tension you want.
L:  That's cool.
R:  And the ar- you've got handles to hold so you can move your arms along.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  Just like if you were running or walking.
L:  Huh.
R:  So, it's -- it's -- when I first go it I got on the thing and I could only go for, like, three minutes. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh really.  Really.
R:  And it wasn't that I -- it was just, like, I guess it just hit different muscles that I wasn't used to using --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- and it just wiped me out so I just very slowly had to keep trying and now it's, you know, thirty, forty minutes I'll do --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- when I get on it so, I mean, I try to do that --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- like four times a week so --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- I figure that -- that's pretty good.  It seems to be doing something.
L:  Yeah, that's really nice.
R:  So, everything seems to be getting a little firmer. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh [LAUGH].  That's good.
R:  And I don't tire out too fast when I do it so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I think it's doing something.
L:  Yeah, that's nice it's -- it's so nice to feel like your body change when you -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when you know you've been working or you know you've been, like, biking.
R:  Yeah, and it's --
L:  You know, all this --
R:  -- all the -- you know, you start to do it --
L:  -- time each day.
R:  -- and it doesn't even take too long and you start to feel things a little --
L:  Yeah, that's -- it's kinda amazing.
R:  -- feel just a little different.
L:  It's not -- like it's not that hard, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  To -- to make the change.  I imagine they always say it gets harder and harder and harder the older you get.
R:  Yeah, that's why I was afraid -- uh, I'm thirty five so --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- I said, "I -- I better -- I better be doing something now".
L:  Yeah, it's probably like --
R:  "And get myself in good shape now before I get any worse" you know, I was like, "I'm not too bad now".
L:  Yeah.
R:  "But if I keep going,  you know, it's gonna be harder".
L:  Yeah, yeah, I --
R:  So --
L:  -- see that being also just like life habits --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- kind of point where you better establish things and then --
R:  Kinda like you don't have to try be- you know, before thirty you don't even have to try.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And [LAUGH] then you hit thirty and it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- starts to go [LAUGH].
L:  I'm twenty eight so I --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I'm -- I'm at the other side of the door [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  It's like they say, "Once you hit thirty it's all down hill".  It's like, "Oh no" but --
L:  [MN] [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh --
R:  I was skinny, skinny for the longest time.
L:  Oh yeah?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  Well --
R:  -- that's why I always tried to work out just to gain a little strength.  I always felt so weak.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  So, I still -- that's why I like doing the weight, I feel like I got a little -- little more strength in me.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, it's nice -- sometimes it's kinda nice just to feel powerful and -- you know, especially when you've exercised and your body is feeling ...
