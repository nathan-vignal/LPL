R:  [NOISE]  Hi, I'm, ah, Lena from [NOISE] Portland, Colorado.
L:  [SIGH]  Hi, I'm Laura from Charlotte.  [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  How, are you today?
L:  Pretty good.  How about you?  [NOISE]
R:  Good.  I had to laugh at the topic.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  It's a nice thought.  How about you?  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I've just recently started, um, exercising.  I didn't used to at all because I didn't really have to and then I started putting on pounds and I -- I looked in the mirror, and I'm like, "I'd better start [LAUGH] exercising".
R:  Wow!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Y- yeah, I'm telling you.  [LAUGH]  Um, I've been putting on pounds for a little while [NOISE] now and, um, [SIGH] the exercising, y- you know, I just -- I have excuses and excuses and excuses as to why not to do it.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  That sounds --
R:  [SIGH]  Oh!
L:  -- like me.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  I- isn't that awful.  [SIGH]  How -- can I ask how old you are?
L:  I'm twenty five.
R:  Mm.  [SIGH]  [MN]  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I'm thirty three.
L:  Okay.
R:  [LAUGH]  And, ah, [MN] I have two kids so I really put on the pounds after --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- the second.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?  [SIGH]  I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- bet.  [LAUGH]  But you'd think you'd run it off with all the kids, you know?
R:  R- right.  And I've never had to worry about food or eating, [NOISE] --
L:  Uh-hum
R:  -- or, [SIGH] you know, I've never ever had to worry about that.  I've always been a hundred and five pounds, um, --
L:  Oh, really?  That's --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- good.  [SIGH]
R:  My daughter is the same weight.  She's sixteen and she, [SIGH] you know, I mean t- they call me, ah, once in a while when she get mad and she tells them, "My mom doesn't feed me".  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, [LAUGH] y- yeah, [SIGH] but she's very thin and, um, --
L:  Wow!  [SIGH]
R:  -- and she'll have that y- you know, until she -- I --
L:  Uh-hum
R:  -- think p- probably twenty nine to thirty.
L:  I think some of my weight is I take birth control pills --
R:  Uh-hum
L:  -- so I think that's part of the problem.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  You know, that -- that probably contributes to it.  [SIGH]  But I've gained -- and plus I -- I used to work as a teacher [SIGH] and I was moving around all day long but n- now I don't do that.  I just sit at the desk, 'cause I'm a secretary mow [LIPSMACK] and --
R:  O- o- oh!
L:  -- I just sit at the desk all day, all day.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  And that's not very ... ah, y- you know, --
R:  [SIGH]  Right.
L:  -- [SIGH] very good for me but I've started walking.  What I do is my husband [SIGH] [NOISE] he likes to play soccer, so he [NOISE] goes to the soc- -- he plays soccer at the soccer field and I'll run -- w- walk the track.  [SIGH]  [MN]
R:  Oh, how nice.
L:  S- so, we do that and [SIGH] I do that --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- about thirty minutes every day now and I've -- haven't noticed m- much of a difference.  I can tell just a little bit of, you know, [SIGH] a little bit in my waist [SIGH] but not --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- to much and I -- but I don't have a scale so I haven't weighed myself [SIGH] but --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- it's really worth it.  It's like [SIGH] --
R:  R- right.  Are you --
L:  -- really worth it.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- is it hot out there or is it --
L:  Well, what I do is we --
R:  -- fairly cool.
L:  -- usually wait till the evening and, um, --
R:  Uh-hum
L:  -- when it's -- y- you know, it's still going to be about seventies, you know, so it's still --
R:  Right.
L:  -- warm but it's not, like, k- killing you.  [SIGH]  So, --
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  -- that's what I've been doing.  [SIGH]  But I keep thinking well when winter comes, this is gonna be over --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- and when vacation comes this is going to over.  So, ...
R:  Oh, wow!  [SIGH]  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  Ah, ...  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well I would like to be where you're at and I would like to have the discipline to do it and [SIGH] I -- I'm about a hundred and forty five now.  A- ah, --
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, you know, and I -- but I can really see it.  I'm short.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  U- um, you know, [SIGH] You know, and I -- I -- I can really feel it and I can really see it and, [NOISE] you know, I don't like it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  But I'm not disciplined enough, you know, I -- I guess after working all day I get tired and --
L:  I know.  When you get -- you just want to go home and go to bed.  You don't want to, [NOISE] you know, even care about that.  And I just -- I find [NOISE] it takes a lot of your time, even thirty minutes is s- so long, [NOISE] --
R:  R- right.
L:  -- you know, that you could be doing something else.  [SIGH]
R:  Right.  [SIGH]
L:  And I just try to do thirty minutes, but that -- that's a lot.
R:  But t- that's good if you're supporting your husband and going out --
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  -- with him to the soccer game then that --
L:  I think that's the best way.
R:  Right.
L:  Both of us are active that way.
R:  [SIGH]  Uh-hum.
L:  That really helps, but [SIGH] I put on about eight pounds every year.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  And I'm up to a hundred and thirty five now so ...
R:  Oh, wow!  How tall --
L:  No, a hundred and forty five --
R:  -- are you?
L:  -- a hundred and forty five actually 'cause I just weighed myself the other day.  [SIGH]  I was a hundred and thirty five two years ago, now I'm a hundred and f- forty five.  [SIGH]  And I'm five five.
R:  Oh, you're taller than I am, see.
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  So, I -- I mean and that helps even those, y- you know, few inches there.  I -- I'm five two so --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [SIGH] t- three inches would make a difference.  I'm sure that you, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- you know, and the fight has been --
L:  And mine's all round the stomach [NOISE] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- it's just -- and I -- I'm thinking, "How do you get rid of that?"  And they say, you know, crunches --
R:  Sit ups.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- or whatever.  [SIGH]  Crunches alone they say you have to work out and, y- you know, do all --
R:  Right.
L:  -- these other things too so.  [SIGH]
R:  I have a pouch.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's what I call it.  I have a pouch in my stomach and [SIGH] -- and I +got it -- I got it in my arms, my hands, you know, I can r- really see it, you know, with my rings and -- and --
L:  Y- yeah, my rings --
R:  -- and I can re- ...  [LAUGH]
L:  -- are getting tight too
R:  R- right.  Y- you know, that happens, I guess, as we get older.  [LAUGH]
L:  I guess so.  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, my dad, he's an exercise fanatic.  [SIGH]  I mean --
L:  O- o- oh!
R:  -- f- f- fanatic.  Yes.  And he's [SIGH] -- he's in his seventies and he is --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- probably the most f- fit person I know.  Every day he goes to the gym and very disciplined and, [SIGH] um, and I smoke too.  So, that makes it even worse, --
L:  R- right.
R:  -- you know, no -- nobody in my family does and [SIGH] -- and he's like, "You've got to lose weight".  [LAUGH]
L:  O- o- oh!  Well, --
R:  But --
L:  -- does he keep his weight down pretty well with that exercising?
R:  He -- he, you know, he looks like my daughter.  They -- they're both very --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- anorexic looking.  And -- and she has been, ah, the teachers in school have, [SIGH] um, you know, have had me come in for, a- ah, you know, to see if she's got some kind --
L:  R- right.
R:  -- of an eating disorder [SIGH] and I --
L:  I used to have --
R:  -- assur- --
L:  -- the same problem.
R:  Really?  I a- assure them --
L:  I used to be so skinny.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Yeah, I assure them that, you know, it's -- and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- she can eat.  She eats anything.  I mean, [SIGH] you know, mainly taco bell is her favorite.  [LAUGH]
L:  O- o- oh!
R:  [SIGH]  Ah, but, um, and o- of course when I take her I eat so that's part of the problem [NOISE].  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH]  I try -- I try to do salads more but, [SIGH] you know, it's -- it's the exercising that counts, I think.
L:  I think s- so and I think that's a big part of mine is just sitting around all day and not exercising because I got one of those speedometers [SIGH] where it --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- counts your steps.  [SIGH]  And I found out that I was just walking, like, two thousands steps a day at work ... in t- the whole eight hours and it said, "You know, you're supposed to be walking ten t- thousand [NOISE] a day".
R:  Ah, r- really?
L:  And I was like, --
R:  W- where did you get --
L:  --"Oh, my gosh!"
R:  -- one of those things?
L:  I bought it off the Internet.
R:  Did you?
L:  I bought it off Ebay.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  [MN]  And, um, I -- and you can get 'em --
R:  And it's just --
L:  -- in the fitness store.
R:  -- call a ca- ...?
L:  Pedometer.  [MN]
R:  Pedometer?  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  And it counts your steps -- how many steps you walk.  And you, um, attach it like a pager on your, um, [SIGH] on your belt or on your ... pants [SIGH] and it counts all -- every step that you take.  [NOISE]  They have digital ones.  I got a cheap one which wasn't d- digital but [SIGH] -- but it really helps me [NOISE] and it motivates me too [NOISE] to walk more 'cause I say, "Well, I'm not doing what I'm supposed to be doing, ten thousand --"
R:  And they say ten thousand steps a day.
L:  Yeah, ten thousand a day.  [LAUGH]
R:  And -- and you got it on E- Ebay.  Is it expensive --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to get, or --
L:  Actually I got it --
R:  -- is it --
L:  -- um, I bid on it for a dollar and then, um, then the shipping, so it was real cheap [NOISE] but it -- but [NOISE] u- usually on there they're more than that.  [SIGH]
R:  So, I just have to watch?
L:  You ought to check it out because, you know, because it's worth it --
R:  I will, --
L:  -- [SIGH] to see what you're doing.
R:  -- now that you told me that.  You have good knowledge.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm glad I -- [LAUGH] I'm glad I got somebody to talk to that knows that, and that's interesting.  I won't forget that you told me ten thousand steps a day.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, does that +equivalent to, you know, a mile or how --
L:  I -- I think that's --
R:  -- what do they say?
L:  -- five miles.  [SIGH]
R:  Five miles is what you're s- supposed to do?
L:  Y- yeah.  Total a day.
R:  So, anything over that is your b- benefit --
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  -- I suppose.  Okay.
L:  [SIGH]  So, I've been trying --
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  -- to do at least ten thousand and I found on the weekends if you go to a mall and stuff I usually do a little bit more than that, but on the weekdays I n- never even [NOISE] [SIGH] hardly get to it.  So, ...
R:  Oh, wow!  Well, you sound really disciplined.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That sounds wonderful.  No, I mean, really.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  I'm trying.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Since I heard that it really [NOISE] -- it really does make me want to, you know, do something now.
R:  Right.  [SIGH]  I mean I want to and I can't imagine that, you know, there is -- people out there who wouldn't want to.  I mean, of course, I want to.  [SIGH]
L:  R- right.
R:  Um, but I always have excuses as to, you know, "Well, I'm tired and I walked all day today and, [LAUGH] you know, --"
L:  R- right.
R:  -- [SIGH] but, it would be interesting as much as I t- tell everybody I actually ... ah, I try to tell my dad I do exercise 'cause I am walking all day [SIGH] ah, I -- you know, I might, ah, I think I'm going to get on Ebay tonight and see if I can't find one of those.
L:  That sounds good.
R:  That might be interesting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That would be g- good.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  The only thing I do is, like, exercise whenever I'm watching TV, you know, walking [SIGH] ... or even just putting in a -- a video tape I'll sometimes do that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH]  I'm not really good about exercising but I've been trying hard and [SIGH] so I've been trying to do something and just -- and even ... s- spicing it up, like, when my husband doesn't go play s- soccer then [SIGH] I'll try do an exercise video or something.
R:  Well, that's good.
L:  [SIGH]  You know, try to -- [SIGH] try to do something.  You can even, you know, download it off the Internet sometimes a --
R:  R- right.  Right.
L:  -- a -- a video and --
R:  Do you feel better since you started it?  You feel better?
L:  I have more [NOISE] energy, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  But, [SIGH] you know, I -- I think it takes a long time to take off weight 'cause I heard that, you know, y- you can s- safely take off a pound a month.
R:  Wow!
L:  [SIGH]  So, that's not very m- much to lose, ah, you know --
R:  R- right.  Right.
L:  -- twelve pounds a year, ten pounds a year, [LIPSMACK] that's --
R:  And it --
L:  -- not very much.
R:  -- seems like we put it on at a q- quicker --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- r- rate [LAUGH] -- a quicker r- rate than that.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's the problem.  Yeah.
R:  That's for sure.
L:  Well, I even asked the doctor about it, you know, what -- you know, this medicine I'm taking or whatever causing this, he's like, you know, he joked with me just p- press away from t- the ... table and exercise and [SIGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I wasn't very happy with that answer.  [SIGH]
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  But, you know, you've just got to do it.
R:  Well, it doesn't sound -- like you're like, you know, t- that -- that hugely over weight, --
L:  No.
R:  -- not r- really.
L:  No, I just have --
R:  It doesn't sound like it's bad.
L:  -- the stomach it all goes t- the one area is the problem.  [NOISE]
R:  Area.  Right.
L:  [SIGH]  It's, like, five or six inches to the stomach and I'm like, "Oh, my God".  [SIGH]
R:  Yes, I feel the same way and -- [SIGH] and when we w- were younger we were so thin, right --
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  -- you said you were [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, very, very thin.
R:  R- right.
L:  Size three.  Two zero, you know, all that and then [SIGH] suddenly you just, "Whoa, where did it come from?"
R:  Come from, e- exactly.  And I never thought I would be somebody that would struggle with it -- ah, y- you know, --
L:  Right.  I know, --
R:  -- throughout my life I never thought that.
L:  -- they always said, you know, "You need [NOISE] to eat more.  You need to eat more" --
R:  [MN]  Right.
L:  -- and they encouraged me to eat [SIGH] because I was too skinny [SIGH] and now I just l- love to eat.  [SIGH]  And, you know, I like to eat out.  I don't -- I don't think I over eat.  I don't even eat, you know, s- snack foods that much.  Candy I like but I don't really like chips too much and [SIGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so, you know, --
R:  Right.  [SIGH]
L:  -- I try to hold back on stuff like [LAUGH] t- that.
R:  Right, yeah, [SIGH] and I keep thinking I'm going to do those sit ups.  Those sit ups are what's going to get rid --
