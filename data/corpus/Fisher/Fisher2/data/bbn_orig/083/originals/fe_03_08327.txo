L:  Hi.  Name's Guy.
R:  Hi.  Uh, this is Susan.  I'm sorry what's your name?
L:  Guy.
R:  Hi, Guy. [LAUGH] How you doing today?
L:  I'm doing okay.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Doing okay.  All right, um, so, uh, you do any, uh, uh, any sports or, uh, workouts?
R:  Uh, yeah.  In fact I'm still in my workout clothes.  I just got back from the gym. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's funny.  So, I am in my shorts and my top and -- and, uh, getting ready to change out of it but the call came in.
L:  Cool, cool.  Uh, do y- --
R:  How about yourself?
L:  Uh, I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- used to, when I met my wife, um, I, um, I used to teach women self defence at the, uh, Hawaii University.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Uh, I u- -- I used to work with CEASE which was Coalition Educating Against Sexual Endangerment, uh, for women who had been victims or -- or had been associated with, uh, uh, violence of some sort.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  So, um --
R:  Fantastic.
L:  It was -- it was fun.  Um, we did Bondo, Pentjak Silat, [NOISE] a little bit of -- of, uh, Jujitsu and, uh, Ikijit- Iki-, uh, Turamish- Turishamu[?] Ikijitsu as well.  So, it was kinda -- it was interesting.  It's, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's the biggest -- I guess it started -- it spread off because, um, kept on seeing these classes where these guys would teach these hundred and ten pound women to pun- -- do full -- full fledged jabs and crosses at guys that were twice their --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- size.  It just start -- started making me cringe.  It's like you don't -- y- -- I mean, I'm a hundred and -- I'm a hundred and fifty pounds, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- sopping wet.  You know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] I -- I would never -- I would never encourage somebody of a hundred and ten pounds to try to slug, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Slug a guy that's two hundred and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- thirty five pounds in the jaw especially if he's drunk or intoxicated or on drugs of some sort.  Just not affective.  I just never really, uh, thought that was something that -- that -- that, uh, they should teach somebody, especially being a small person myself.
R:  Right.
L:  So, it's, um -- so basically, um, suffice to say martial arts is of course --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the workout of choice for me.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, I've, uh -- as I've gotten older I've found that, um, um -- I had a, uh, in a tournament I had my hip kicked out of place, um --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  Uh, they tore the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Iliofemoral tendon, the ligament [inaudible].
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  That was -- yeah, that was fun.  Uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But --
R:  Big fun.
L:  The ligament basically supports the hip in the, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- in the j- -- in the ball socket.
R:  Yes.
L:  And when that was torn out it kinda weakened that whole left side so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, tournament fighting was out of -- out of the question for me for a while. [LAUGH] 
R:  Wow.
L:  So, um, now I go --
R:  Did you --
L:  -- into Qigong.  I do, uh, Qigong.  I do a little bit Tai Chi but I found that Dan Yan Qigong --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and falun dafa it's -- it's pretty effective.  Um, my wife is in Raki[?].
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Uh, it's an alternative medicine [inaudible].
R:  I know exactly what it is.
L:  Yeah, she's, um, she's a Raki master and, uh, we started up wi- -- we took, um, uh, Dan Yan Qigong which is, uh, Wild Goose Qigong from one of the mast- -- resident masters in China and she's now in -- in, uh, I think she's in --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- California.  What city I wouldn't know.  But, um, yeah, it -- I found that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um   Oh, wait, here's her name.  Way Mei Yu -- Wen Mei Yu.  W.E.N. M.E.I. -- hello?
R:  Yes.
L:  Last name Yu, Y. -- Y.U.  So, of course, um, that works out best for -- I'm gonna change phones of course 'cause my other phone is dying presently.
R:  Yeah, it sounded like it was a little bit iffy.  I wasn't sure what that was.
L:  Yep, it's doing it again.  Let me, uh, find the other phone.
R:  Okay.
L:  And --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Bef- before it dies. [NOISE] Let's see what happens. [NOISE] I'm gonna have to change into another phone.  If you could just hold on for just a second.
R:  Okay.
L:  Anyway --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Tell me about what you do.
R:  Well, um, for me what I'm doing, and I do it erratically and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I just made another --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- promise to myself to do it not erratically is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I go to the gym.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I do, um, [NOISE] weight work.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And, uh, what I -- that's like three times a week.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then the other, at least another --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- couple of days I like to get out and walk and I --
L:  Good.  Walking spurns --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- more calories than running.
R:  Right.  And, you know, burning calories is just not an issue for me.  I maintain weight -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I had -- I'm fifty five years old [NOISE] and I basically am the same weight I was when I was a teenager and --
L:  Well done.
R:  Yeah, I'm like a hundred [NOISE] and four pounds and I've -- I've never had much weight fluctuation in my whole life and so burning calories is simply not an issue but being in shape is an issue and keeping calcium in my bones is an issue and, um -- excuse me a second.  Could I ask you not to do that right now? [NOISE] Thanks.  Um, so I'm doing it to really keep myself fit.  I- it's not like a -- a weight thing.  I, you know, I -- I take good care of that -- that portion without, you know, with- without doing any weight training.  But -- so I'm doing the lifting the three times a week and, um, [LAUGH] I'm sorry just got distracted.  My parrot let himself out of his [NOISE] cage.  Hello. [LAUGH] Interesting call.  At any rate and, uh, I live in an area, Philadelphia, that's very close to the biggest in city park in the world and this is this fabulous park called Fairmount Park and it's just beautiful and you can't believe you're in the city and, um, it just -- to me it's like communing with nature.  It's really just a tremendous thing.  It's like a meditative exercise actually.  So, that's what I'm doing although, like I said, I've been erratic with it at times.  So, I'm trying to be at a place where I can be consistent.  Are -- are you hearing me?  Are you there?  I'm not hearing you.  Hello? [NOISE] Did I lose ya? [NOISE] Hi?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello, Guy? [NOISE] Well, I just took that off so he has let himself out.  Y- you -- I mean, you're saying that they're distracting.  You're hearing stuff there.  I don't know what happened here. [NOISE] Well, [NOISE] -- Okay.  I don't know.  Guy, I'm not hearing you if you're there. [NOISE] I don't know what happened.  The call's still going on.  I'm not getting disconnected.  I don't know what this is. [SIGH] I'm gonna hang on in case Guy comes back on.  I've never had this happen before. [NOISE] Sorry about this everybody.  Let's hope we can get him. [NOISE] I'm just gonna hang on here. [NOISE] Doesn't seem auspicious, but [NOISE] [PAUSE] Hello? [NOISE]
