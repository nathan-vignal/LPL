L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I'm fifty one.
L:  [SIGH]  Um, I'm twenty six.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- actually I've only done this once before.  So, I'm still, like, [NOISE] not sure how it all goes [LAUGH] but ...  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, they said that [NOISE] [COUGH] they needed to, um, [LIPSMACK] have the computer distinguish between voices.
L:  [SIGH]  Right.
R:  [NOISE]  Ah, where you're located and where I'm located.
L:  Interesting.
R:  So, --
L:  [LIPSMACK]  I -- well, you know, it's not going to work on me 'cause even though I live in New York City I'm [NOISE] f- from Marilyn which, you know, is so different.  Well, it's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- different, but not different.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, it is because I have a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- best friend that lives in, um, [LIPSMACK] Frederick, Marilyn.
L:  Oh, that's r- right near my home town.  I'm -- Westminster is, like, right next door.
R:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  That's so funny.  [LAUGH]
R:  Because, um, [LIPSMACK] sh- --I -- in fact I was visiting her last year [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and we were ju- -- I was kidding her about the -- she always says, "Washington", you know, and --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- some of these other words.
L:  Y- y- yes.  [LAUGH]
R:  And, of course, I have --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- the Maine accent anyway.
L:  [LAUGH]  That's so --
R:  [LIPSMACK]  So, anyway, --
L:  -- funny.
R:  -- that -- that's pretty good.
L:  Y- yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- it's --
L:  Um, so the topic was [NOISE] health and fitness?
R:  Right.  [NOISE]
L:  [MN]
R:  [MN]  I'm disabled.  I -- I've had a bad car accident --
L:  O- o- oh!
R:  -- so I don't --
L:  I'm sorry.
R:  -- so I, ah, [SIGH] hey, so that's okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I walk with a cane so as far as physical fitness goes [LAUGH] --
L:  Y- yeah, you don't have, y- yeah.
R:  I don't do a lot of -- do a lot of that, anymore, um, --
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  What do you do?
L:  [SIGH]  Um, well I'm realistic[?] but when it comes to exercise I'm gonna do something but I haven't actually done anything [NOISE] in a long t- [LAUGH] time.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  I mean I live in New York City so ... [MN] I walk a lot, ah, you know you just walk a lot.  Ah, [SIGH] my job is, [SIGH] like, the very last street before you hit the water so I have to walk.  Like, I like a ten or fifteen walk to work [NOISE] everyday [SIGH] and, you know --
R:  So, what --
L:  -- that kind of stuff.
R:  -- do you do?
L:  [SIGH]  I work -- I actually work in cancer hospital, Sloan Kettering.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [SIGH]  Sort of like I'm a patient representative, like, I, um, [SIGH] prepare people for surgery and, [SIGH] you know, just give 'em all the information they need, work out transportation and money and, like, stuff like that.  [NOISE]
R:  Mm, that's a very good job.
L:  It's pretty interesting.  I really like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it.  You meet a lot of really ... neat people, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LIPSMACK]  And, um, it also has good b- benefits, like, health care and stuff which is good.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, ... --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I know, um, with this [NOISE] [SIGH] -- so t- this is your second call?
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  Okay, this is my first one.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And a friend of mine got me [SIGH] tied up with this.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They said, you know, thirty dollars, you know?  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, it's a chi ching, right.  [LAUGH]
R:  And -- huh?
L:  Chi ching, you know, --
R:  Yeah.  Right.
L:  -- it's nice to make extra money.
R:  Yes.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  And then, ah, they'll pass your name around to other universities [SIGH] so they can --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- do studies also.
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, that's so interesting.  I didn't know that.
R:  Yes, [NOISE] that's --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- because -- because when I signed up they asked me [SIGH] if I would be interested in doing other ... s- studies with other universities.  And I said, sure I said -- [SIGH] I said, "Sure I can [SIGH] sit on the phone and talk" --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- I said.  So, that's not a problem.
L:  [LAUGH]  I- it -- it's interesting, I -- I -- it's, um, [SIGH] la- last person [NOISE] I think was from [SIGH] Colorado, or something like that.
R:  Really?
L:  So, it's -- I -- I'm curious, like, to find all the different places people are going to be from, you know, what I mean.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, they said they were going to do it for all over the world.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.  Oh, really?
R:  Because --
L:  Well, I didn't --
R:  -- they asked me --
L:  -- realize that.  [NOISE]
R:  -- they didn't ask you what language you spoke?
L:  [SIGH]  They probably --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they did.  I think they did ask what language.  I just -- I -- I guess coming from New York [SIGH] I'm just so used to seeing people s- speaking different languages --
R:  Really?
L:  -- I just -- you know what I mean?  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH]  I didn't think about it world wide --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- I was just thinking [SIGH] --
R:  Y- yeah, no, because a girl that I spoke to asked me [SIGH] if I could speak, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, [NOISE] French or [SIGH] -- or German and I said, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- "No, just English" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and she said, [SIGH] "Because, ah, we have a lot of, ah, [SIGH] people [NOISE] from other places".
L:  [SIGH]  Interesting.
R:  And I said, "Oh, so this goes all over the world".  She said, "Oh, yes".
L:  Wow!  Ah, -- I wonder -- I -- I'm so curious to know what t- the r- results [NOISE] are, you know what I mean?
R:  Right.
L:  It's very interesting.
R:  [SIGH]  But they need males.
L:  O- o- oh!
R:  They don't have that many men to, um, --
L:  I tried -- I tried to get my boyfriend to do it 'cause I was like, you know, i- it's like free money and he was like, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- "No, I'm not talking on the phone, --"
R:  Well, that's --
L:  "-- nah".  [LAUGH]
R:  -- what my boyfriend said.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  He said, "I'm not giving out my Social Security number and I'm not --"
L:  [SIGH]
R:  "-- gonna s- sit on the phone for --"
L:  [SIGH]
R:  "-- thirty dollars" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- he said, "I can go out and do something else --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- to make thirty bucks".  So, I said, "Okay".
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, it's only, ah, ten minutes, like, that's hardly anything, right?  [SIGH]
R:  Right.  That's the way I look at it.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But a lot of people kind of, ... um, they don't want to give their ... Social Security number out --
L:  [MN]  Oh, yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  -- because they're afraid that someone's gonna --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- take their identity.
L:  Ah, see I use- -- I used to work, um, -- I used to live in Baltimore [NOISE] right near John's Hopkins?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH]  So, I did a couple of medical studies.  Like, things like this or, you know, do- -- taking, like, um, [SIGH] -- one was like doing, like, taking Tylenol and telling, -- you know, that kind of thing.  Like, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- t- and so I, sort of, ... knew what the drill was, you know what I mean?
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH]  And they make such a big deal, like, these at John's Hopkins, like, -- and I'm sure they do it the same w- way with this one.  They give you a number, they don't even use your name, -- you know what I mean, like, things --
R:  Right.
L:  -- like that.
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, 'cause you have a pin number and stuff.
L:  Right.  [SIGH]
R:  [COUGH]  But now the other lady [SIGH] that I talked to said you're supposed to introduce yourself and tell you where you're from.
L:  [SIGH]  Y- yeah, oh, o- --
R:  [SIGH] So, ...
L:  -- so probably when they record everything I guess they make a note of it, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- m- maybe.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  I'm trying, --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- um, I wonder a- ah, I wonder if the topic [NOISE] really is just something to talk about or they actually want you to talk about that?  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Well, [SIGH] a lot of --
L:  You know.  [SIGH]
R:  -- a lot of times, I suppose, ah, [SIGH] -- ah, fitness, I mean [SIGH] the things that you [NOISE] normally would do would be diet.  [SIGH]  I mean, [SIGH] -- so let's face it there's too many obese people in the world.  [MN]
L:  [NOISE]  I know.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  They need to [SIGH] structure themselves as far as daily [SIGH] eating habits --
L:  Yeah, well I mean I think now fitness is also just, you know, eating right.
R:  [SIGH]  Well --
L:  Ye-
R:  -- you figure if you took out, ah, candy bars, chips and soda out of the schools [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- the kids wouldn't be as fat.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Ah, that's for sure and --
R:  Because when I was in school they didn't have any of that stuff.
L:  Right.  Even where -- even when I was -- I went to [NOISE] a Catholic school though so, -- well, you know, it was a little stricter but we didn't have it --
R:  Oh, I know all about --
L:  -- we didn't have any soda.  [SIGH]
R:  -- Catholics because my -- my whole family's Catholic so --
L:  Oh, so you know.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yes, I know believe me I understand that --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- my father went to, ah, -- well my [LIPSMACK] father +original -- +originally -- I messed up.  My father was born in Dilworth, Minnesota, [SIGH] but his family got [NOISE] [SIGH] stationed in Newport, Rhode Island.
L:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
R:  And my grandfather was a -- [SIGH] Commander of the Navy base there.  [MN]
L:  Wow!
R:  And, ah, so -- y- you've heard of Salve Regina College?
L:  Yes.
R:  It's an all girls Catholic sch- c- college.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Well, I was accepted there but I didn't go there because I had to aunts that lived in Newport [SIGH] and I wouldn't have been able to stay in the dorm, I'd have had to stay with them.  And --
L:  That would have been no fun.  [LAUGH]
R:  No fun at -- no fun at all.  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I decided, no, didn't want to go there.  [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, ah, [SIGH] -- um, you know.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, [SIGH] that's so --
R:  So, ...  [COUGH]
L:  -- I know --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- I -- I got the big -- I've got the big Irish Catholic family so [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] that's how it all came to be.  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  So, do you have brothers and sisters?
L:  I do.  I have a brother who is [NOISE] going to college at the University of Maryland now.  [SIGH]  He's twenty.  [SIGH]  And, um, I came to New York to be -- I'm a photographer but [SIGH] which was going -- actually going pretty well until [NOISE] September Eleventh and [SIGH] since then --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there hasn't really [NOISE] been a lot of jobs.  [SIGH]
R:  [MN]  Yes, [SIGH] but the economy's bad everywhere.
L:  Oh, it's really -- [SIGH] it's very bad.  [SIGH]
R:  Yep, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- because I know in Newport [SIGH] a friend of mine that's [NOISE] worked at this hotel, the Viking Hotel in Newport, u- um, for the last, probably, fifteen years, [SIGH] ah, she did not get called this summer.  [MN]
L:  Oh, my God!
R:  She just works -- she just works summers.  [SIGH]  But her kids, you know, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and, um, [LIPSMACK] she said, "No".  She said they don't need her.
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, my gosh.  [NOISE]
R:  So, ...
L:  See, that's so -- [SIGH] it's just so scary.  [NOISE]  Here in New York there are so many lay offs.  [NOISE]  E- every ... week some -- one of my friends is getting laid off from their job.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  And not even just, um, you know not computer jobs, like, ah, you know just normal jobs.
R:  Anything.  [MN]
L:  That's [SIGH] -- see the -- the bad and good thing about my job is ... people aren't going to stop having cancer.
R:  No.
L:  [LAUGH]  So, my job's pretty safe, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know.  But [SIGH] as long as you're -- they're very -- th- they're really, um, [MN] I don't know what the word is.  They're really strict w- with the way their employees are, though, so you have to, like, ... follow through all these things all the time.  [SIGH]  Then you get evaluated, like, constantly -- like every three months.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Right.
L:  But it's a good job.  It -- it's -- I met so many cool, you know, people that are patients and most people [NOISE] end up being okay so you get to see 'em, you know, for a long time after that.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Usually with the chemo and the [SIGH] -- and the [COUGH] radiation.  We have a lot of cancer in this area.  [NOISE]  I'm a hospice volunteer and --
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, that's so nice of you.  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] and usually ... the last six months is, you know, -- well that's what we say, [MN] 'cause if the doctor says they only have six months then hospice seem to win.
L:  [NOISE]  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  And, you know, a lot of times the way -- ah, most things I do are outpatients, though.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  That -- that's the hard thing 'cause I just find out later.  Do you know what I [NOISE] mean?  Like, I --
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- I -- I'm the beginning part of that year then, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  I can't imagine but that's so wonderful.
R:  And then, of course, my son's a funeral director.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]  Oh, my goodness.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Because I used to do nur- ah, in home nursing care of elderly before my accident [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and, um, my son graduated from funeral -- well, funeral school I guess.  [COUGH]  It's Mount Ida in, ah, Massachussetts [SIGH] in, ah, ninety four.
L:  [SIGH]  So, how did he end up choosing that?
R:  [SIGH]  He always wanted to do it.
L:  [MN]  How interesting.
R:  And, ah, my, ah, -- I -- I wasn't married to his father -- my long terms boyfriend [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- said to me.  He said, "Hey" he says, "He'll never lose any work".
L:  That's for sure, right.  [LAUGH]
R:  I said, "That's for sure".  I said --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- "They'll always so dying to see him!"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, ah, [COUGH] with me being in hospice and everything [SIGH] course, they'll say, "Do you know a funeral director?" and, of course, I'll say, "Of course" you know --
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  -- and, of course, most of them know that, you know t- that he's my son anyway, they just, you know, ask me.  [SIGH]  So, ...
L:  Oh, my goodness.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  So, we gotta get 'em coming and going here.  [SIGH]
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
