R:  [NOISE]  Hi!
L:  Hi!
R:  [NOISE]  Hi, there.  My name's --
L:  My [NOISE] --
R:  -- Donna.
L:  Hi, my name is Laura.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, hi there.
L:  Hi, ... nice to meet you.  [SIGH]
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  I'm in Canada, --
L:  I --
R:  -- where are you?  [SIGH]
L:  Cool!  I'm in Milwaukee.
R:  O- o- oh, [NOISE] cool.
L:  Yeah, where in Canada?
R:  [SIGH]  Ah, Manitoba.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, very --
R:  Right in the middle of the country.  [LAUGH]
L:  Wow, very cool.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  So, --
L:  So, do you -- so do you work out?  [SIGH]
R:  No.  [LAUGH]
L:  No.  [LAUGH]
R:  Do you?
L:  [SIGH]  Um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] I used to.  Well, [SIGH] I do --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I try to.  Um, --
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  -- I have been a little bit more active, like, a year ago --
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] or so and then this last year has been kind of hard but I actually did go and [SIGH] -- I went to a class --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- [SIGH] yesterday called Body Pump and I [SIGH] -- it's a -- kind of like a weightlifting class, or whatever.
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  And you -- and I'm actually very sore t- [LAUGH] today [LAUGH] so I didn't --
R:  Oh, are you?  [LAUGH]
L:  -- like [inaudible] -- [LAUGH] y- yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  That's what I always find when you first start a -- a fitness program, it's the day after [SIGH] that's just a killer, right.  'Cause --
L:  Y- yeah, exactly.
R:  --  you -- you're getting used to all the -- all the w- weights and everything.  Is it a -- is it just totally a weight lifting program [NOISE] that you do?
L:  U- um, it is, a- ah, [MN] basically you have --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- like, one bar and you can adjust ... [SIGH] you can adjust the weights on it.  [SIGH]  And, um, --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- well it's like -- kind of like, um, --
R:  [NOISE]  It's weight lifting?
L:  -- it's how -- it's kind of like the same basis as, like, a- aerobics class where they have different songs and, like, the first song you do, like, squats --
R:  O- o- oh!  [NOISE]
L:  -- with the weights bar and then this -- you know, like the second song and you'll work like you're biceps.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  I thought --
L:  And then the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- yeah, --
R:  I think I've heard of that.
L:  It -- it's actually -- it, -- ah, it is a really good class because [SIGH] if I go to my health club and I just say I'm going to weight li- -- lift weights --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] I ... don't do a very thorough job.  So, I'm probably am not doing ... my body any better than -- you know what I mean --
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- than the couch or whatever but --
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- [SIGH] 'cause I --
R:  [SIGH]  Like --
L:  -- am kind of an impatient person so it h- helps for me to go to --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- classes and stuff --
R:  And then be told "Okay, --"
L:  -- like that.
R:  "-- now you do those, now you do that".  Not like [LAUGH] "Okay".
L:  E- exactly, --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and it's -- I guess it's more motivating and stuff like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, ... yeah.
R:  [SIGH]  Well, I find anything you have to pay for is a good [LAUGH] motivation to d- [LAUGH] do it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  If you have the best intentions of going for a walk I find that, [SIGH] ah, me I'd love to go for a walk and, you know, take my little one.  I have a little one that I [SIGH] -- I'll pull around the -- r- round the neighborhood in her wagon and stuff like that but [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- mainly it's p- playing with her, running around with her.  T- that's my exercise, right now.  [SIGH]
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  I used to -- I used to be in a gym and ... I -- I enjoyed it.  [NOISE]  I liked the treadmill.  I- it -- I was on, ah, in a gym that was [SIGH] on the penthouse basically [SIGH] and --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- it overlooked the whole city.
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, neat.
R:  So, it had --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- windows all the way around it, and it was just a small gym.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And you would get on the treadmill a- and you'd walk and you'd see the +sky -- city skyline.  It was --
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  -- really neat.
L:  Mm, very nice.
R:  [SIGH]  I did like that.  It was a lot of fun to go in there.  [SIGH]  But I --
L:  Gorgeous.
R:  -- had -- like I said with a little one you -- you have very little time.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I can't even --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- imagine.  [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  [SIGH]  The, ah, -- the work that you're talking about, [NOISE] I think we have something s- similar up here.  [SIGH]  I think it's called, um, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what is it?  [SIGH]  S- -- not Shapes or some- -- Curves, [NOISE] --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- that's what it's called up here I think.  [SIGH]  'Cause a -- a friend --
L:  That's --
R:  -- of mine went to that and it sounds ... ex- extremely familiar.  [SIGH]  She said --
L:  [MN]  Y- yeah.
R:  -- that, um, it's like a half hour [NOISE] or twenty minute work out.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And you do, like, a minute on each station.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Yes.
R:  And they tell you when to switch.
L:  Yeah, that's actually --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they have a class --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- at my health club.  It's called, um, circuit training --
R:  [SIGH]  Y- yeah.
L:  -- basically, and it's, um, when I -- 'cause a few --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- years ago --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I had lost, like, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- thirty five pounds and t- that's when I --
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- [SIGH] first started going to my health club and --
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- that's one of the first programs I started doing.  It's -- it's, um, it's a good program for people --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- who are -- j- just [SIGH] starting to get in shape or starting to lose weight.
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  Because it's not so --
R:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  -- I guess s- shocking on your body.  [NOISE]
R:  Y- yeah.  That makes sense.
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  [SIGH]  I know, I did the same thing, --
L:  And --
R:  -- I lost, um, [SIGH] forty eight pounds.
L:  Wow!
R:  [SIGH]  And, like, basically it was just watching what I ate.  [SIGH]
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  So, for me to add e- exercise into it, it was like, [SIGH] o- o- [LAUGH] oh!  [LAUGH] It's hard enough watching what I eat so I haven't really gotten back into [SIGH] --
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  -- exercising but, [NOISE] yeah, I'd like to.  [SIGH]  I'd like to get --
L:  [NOISE]  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  -- more motivated to be able to do, --
L:  I know, --
R:  -- [SIGH] ah, have the time.
L:  -- it's so easy to say, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- "I'll do it tomorrow".
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  "I'll do it tomorrow".  [LAUGH]
R:  I know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Do you find you have more energy ... though ... when you do exercise?
L:  I do.  [SIGH]
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  Um, I -- I really do.  It --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it helps ... l- like for, -- you know, stress --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, from work and --
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- stuff like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's, um, [LIPSMACK] --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- I -- I think ... i- it does, like, um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I can tell even from going to that class last night, --
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- [SIGH] like, tension that I hold in my muscles and stuff like that --
R:  Oh, yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- I -- I -- you can relax some ... [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- more and stuff like that.  So, I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I think it's a good ... stress release.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And, ah, ...
R:  I think so too, yeah.  But i- it -- the exercise helps.  It's a good stress buster.  That's what I heard.  [SIGH]
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  [SIGH]  Y- yeah, it makes sense.
L:  It helps you ... [SIGH] it helps me [SIGH] I guess sleep better --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- at n- night and --
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Well, you're so tired and sore.  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Can't do anything else anyways.
R:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  Have you ever done aquacise?  Those aquacise cla- classes?
L:  [SIGH]  Um, no, as a matter of fact though there is a ... class at my club called H Two  O and I was t- thinking of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- trying it.  [SIGH]  I actually have done --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I lied I did do, like, water aerobics once with my mum --
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  -- my mom at her health club.  [NOISE]
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [MN]  And that was nice.
R:  Oh, like --
L:  [NOISE]  Um, a lot of --
R:  -- yeah, I did that for a while.
L:  Did you?
R:  I did and I liked it.  I liked it a lot because it's, ah, [SIGH] it's something different, --
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  -- you know and you're in the water and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] I -- I -- I don't know -- like, I'm not a big swimmer but for me that was -- it was [NOISE] -- it was good because it -- it's, you know, less stressful on your joints and [SIGH] it's fun, --
L:  Well, it's not like --
R:  -- you know, you're splashing round the --
L:  -- you're --
R:  pool.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- yeah, exactly.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's not like you're -- like, --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- you're, ah, [SIGH] -- you know, ki- -- you know, killing your body trying to do it either --
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- you understand.  It's -- you're just kind of going at it as, ah, -- it's just fun and, --
R:  [NOISE]  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- [NOISE] you know, and you're getting --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- exercise while you're doing it.  And it's nice 'cause [SIGH] it's not as -- it's good on your joints and you're, [SIGH] you know, it's not --
R:  It is.
L:  -- it's not hard on your body at all, like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- some, like, running and --
R:  O- o- oh!  [SIGH]
L:  -- [SIGH] some other types of --
R:  I have n- never --
L:  -- exercise.
R:  -- been into running.  [LAUGH]
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  I don't see the point.  I'm, like, "Sorry", [LAUGH] I'll walk --
L:  Right.
R:  -- somewhere but --  [LAUGH]
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I used to force myself to run.  [SIGH]
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  In fact I had run, like, a couple, like, five K runs, like, after I had l- lost weight and stuff and --
R:  Wow!  [SIGH]  You're brave.
L:  -- they're -- well, [NOISE] yeah, --
R:  [NOISE]
L: -- it is [PAUSE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't know.  I think r- running for me is more of a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- me- mental thing.
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  'Cause whenever I'm running I'm like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] I'm like this.  [SIGH]  "I hate this".
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "When's it going to be over?"  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You want to do something you enjoy.
L:  Exactly, and I always have, like, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] more negative thoughts when I'm running --
R:  [LAUGH]
L: -- 'cause [NOISE] I didn't want to start it.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  It's like, "When am I gonna get where I'm going?"  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  [SIGH]  All this effort.  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  Yeah, I --
L:  I feel like running --
R:  -- know.
L:  -- after the ice cream truck --
R:  Oh, y- yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- down the road, though.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  There's some good [NOISE] motivation.  [LAUGH]
L:  Y- yes.  [SIGH]  [LAUGH]
R:  Follow the ice cream man on his round.  [LAUGH]
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  I would be exercising very, very much [LAUGH] if that was the c- [LAUGH] case.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, exactly, me too.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  So, how -- how -- what do you do during this -- like, you guys have -- have big skiing seasons out there too, don't you?  [SIGH]
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  Um, actually we were just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- o- out in January we went skiing out in, ah, Whistler, --
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- in British Columbia.
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Yeah, so.  [SIGH]
R:  It's beautiful up that way.  [SIGH]
L:  Y- yeah, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] it is.  It was very, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- very beautiful but, u- um, ... I don't know r- right now in the summer ... it's hot and muggy.  And --
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- in the winter we like to ski and stuff and --
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- so, um, --
R:  Mm.  [SIGH]  There's lots of things you can do for exercise, you know.
L:  Like to keep active, yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  I like roller blading for fun, too.
R:  Oh, [SIGH] wow!  I, --
L:  I'm like --
R:  -- you know, I'm so -- always [SIGH] -- ah, the old roller s- skates, [SIGH] you know, --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- I'm more comfortable on those than the new roller blades.  I get into the new roller blades, I don't know how to stop!  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  I mean I'm not  that o- old.  [LAUGH]
L:  It takes a while to learn.  [NOISE]
R:  Good grief.  [LAUGH]  Like, I don't know how to stop on those things.  [NOISE]  They're scary.  [SIGH]  [LAUGH]
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  I think I tried them once and I wiped out.  Oh, that was not so bad.  [LAUGH]
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  I know.  If you have a good pair and you have a good break at the front, --
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- you know, they have foot brakes --
R:  Oh, it makes a huge --
L:  -- and stuff in the front.
R:  -- difference.
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  No, it's on the back.  On roller blades it's in the back.
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  And it does take a while to learn how to use those.
R:  [NOISE]  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  I just p- probably because the in line skates are more like s- skating skating.  [SIGH]
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  Are they?  [SIGH]
L:  Y- you m- mean, --
R:  [NOISE]
L: -- more like, um, --
R:  Like, um, --
L:  -- ice skating?
R:  -- ice skates, yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  They are.
R:  [SIGH]  I'm not really good with my balance on skates.  [LAUGH]
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You need to have a good surface and stuff to do it on too.
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  And if you don't have a good flat surface, it's kind of, --
R:  [NOISE]  It's hard.
L:  -- you know, you don't want ... s- stones and [LAUGH] s- stuff like that.
R:  No.  [LAUGH]  My first attempt I wouldn't be going down the s- sidewalk on the street, that's for [LAUGH] s- [LAUGH] sure.  [LAUGH]
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  [LAUGH]
R:  That wouldn't be much fun.  [SIGH]
L:  No.
R:  So, I don't know.
L:  So, what do you -- do you do any winter sports at all or anything --
R:  U- um --
L:  -- like that, up in Canada?
R:  -- y- you know, [SIGH] [NOISE] my husband, ah, p- plays hockey now and then and [SIGH] -- and that's [NOISE] ... pretty well it.  Like, I -- I don't tend to -- I don't really like winter.  I really don't know why I live here, [SIGH] [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- anyway 'cause it's just too cold.
