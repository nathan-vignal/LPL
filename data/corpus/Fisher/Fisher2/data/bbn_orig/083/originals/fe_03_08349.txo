L:  Hi, my name is Pat Voss.
R:  Hi, I'm Deborah.
L:  Hi, Deborah.
R:  What's the topic?
L:  Uh, the topic is health and fitness.
R:  Health and fitness.
L:  Health and fitness --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and the -- the robot operator said, um, more specifically do you exercise regularly to maintain some level of wellness I -- I think that's what she said and if you -- if so, how much and if not, would you like to? [LAUGH]
R:  Got it.  Got it.  Yeah, well, um, so, um, do you wanna go first?
L:  Oh sure.  Uh, well, first off, um, yes I do exercise regularly, presently I'm not because I hung wallpaper two and a half weeks ago and pinched a -- I gotta pinched nerve in my neck that I'm going to the chiropractor for --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but, um, ordinarily, I do run a couple of days a week and I do exercises and lift these little hand weights, you know.
R:  Oh.
L:  A couple of times a week.
R:  Um, how far do you run?
L:  Um, it depends.  I would say that the average distance is about three miles.
R:  Okay.
L:  But I was up to six miles maybe a couple of months ago and then I don't know I just sort fell off the wagon and -- [LAUGH]
R:  Do you -- do you, um, do you ever enter any competitions?
L:  I have but for me they're not competitive.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  They -- I  mean, the competition is against myself, you know, the -- the --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the challenge --
R:  Well, that's one of the definitions of competition.
L:  Uh, right [LAUGH], the challenge is to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is to finish.
R:  Right.
L:  Y- you know [LAUGH] and --
R:  No, no that's what I meant.  I mea- what I mean was --
L:  Right.
R:  -- what I should have said probably was do you ever enter runs with a whole lot of other people?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, and -- and, um --
R:  'Cause --
L:  -- a- and I, you know, on at least one occasion have the dubious distinction of being the last one in, that was --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- my -- my fiftieth birthday I did a ten k with one of my daughters.  And, um, it was -- it was everything that I could possibly do to finish --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, upright, not crawling --
R:  Right.
L:  -- over the finish line.
R:  Right, well I like this topic because, um, I've learned a whole lot of stuff about fitness over the last forty five years and, um, I run -- I run as well and --
L:  Oh really?  
R:  Yeah, and --
L:  Where are you located?
R:  Pardon?
L:  Are we allowed to -- are we allowed to say where we are?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  What state are you in?
R:  Um, I live in Hawaii.
L:  Oh, well so you have that really rough terrain, you know, there's a -- um, a number of events out there that when I read Runners World I'm thinking, "Man, I would die before I could that" [LAUGH].
R:  Well, Hawaii is hills.
L:  Uh-huh, that's what I'm saying.
R:  They're e- even -- even the beach isn't flat.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, there's a cross country coach at the school that I teach at that says your h- hills are your allies.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, Mary Baker Eddie also says, "Translates thing into thoughts".  And so one of the things I've been doing over the last few years, which I've actually have been demonstrating beautifully during my running -- better than other things, although I did manage to use this in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- biking as well, is, um, run with, um, with the goal to be relaxed and have it effortless.  And also I read something recently that said that, um, mouth breathing is emergency breathing and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that if you can do as much running as possible breathing only through your nose --
L:  Right, that's what I do.
R:  -- what you do -- good for you.  You -- you --
L:  Yeah, because, uh -- because that means that you're running at an appropriate pace for your level of fitness.
R:  Right, and when you breathe through your nose you're also giving your heart a chance to slow down and get the oxygen it needs slower because --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- when you breathe through your mouth it's --
L:  Uh-huh, right you're --
R:  -- racing to get --
L:  -- going [MN], right, you're gulping.
R:  Right, and when -- when I finished the, um, the Lavaman the second time it was really hot conditions and I -- I nearly collapsed --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it took me three hours to get my breath back --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and I thought it was for other reasons --
L:  Uh-huh
R:  -- and then I went, "Hey, wait a minute, if I'd trained myself in nose breathing --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- I wouldn't be doing this as desperately as I was" that -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, so I'm on a -- I'm -- I'm practising now forcing --
L:  It's hard.
R:  -- myself to breathe --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- only through my nose.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But I also -- what I've been doing is when I, um, run or when I, uh, enter, uh, runs with people I -- I repeat either quotes from the Bible that I like --
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  -- or, um, music that is uplifting or hymns that are uplifting and it -- and a lot of people think that what I'm -- and I get people criticizing me for this because they say I'm doing, um, out of body kind of stuff that you can't -- they -- they think you can't coordinate this with what you're doing.  But I find it does -- it has the exact opposite effect that when I'm doing this I can think on five or six different levels --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- at a time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like a computer that's got different --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- different, um, windows --
L:  Programs open, uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, and, um, and I think we're more intelligent than a computer because we built them --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- and so if a computer can do it why can't we.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it's really cool.  I get -- I'm -- and, you know, what -- what they call being in the zone hasn't happened to me too many times but it's happened enough --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that I love -- I love running.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um -- and also I have a -- another friend that told me that we don't run to get fit we run because we are fit.  And it took me about five years --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to figure that out.
L:  Ah, right [LAUGH] to really buy into --
R:  But get --
L:  -- it, right?
R:  Right, get fit implies --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that what we have evaporates and that's what the fitness industry tells us.  That unless you get this and unless you do that, unless you pay me, um, this is gonna evaporate and you're not going to have anything --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you're gonna be less than zero.
L:  Right.
R:  At -- whereas demonstrating that we are fit implies that even somebody who's a hundred, like, a thousand pounds, if they can still walk across the room and are not bedridden --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they're demonstrating some degree of fitness.
L:  Some level, that's right.
R:  So that anything we do is demonstrating fitness, joy, balance, equilibrium, um, strength, um, and I don't believe these qualities are just material anyway, I think they're --
L:  Right, I agree.
R:  -- they're something bigger, yeah. 
L:  Yeah, I agree.
R:  So, that's what I -- that's what I do when I -- and when I did the Lavaman [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, that's the one that I was thinking of not -- you know, I'm in Florida and so I -- and I've never been to Hawaii so I have -- I couldn't recall that but when you said Lavaman I realized that's the one that I read about -- I'm like -- I was reading this article and I'm going, "Oh, I can't believe this" [LAUGH].
R:  Well, what I did last time was -- there's like seven or eight big hills on the -- on the bike --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and the first big hill is just plain work going up it --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the part that gets me is coming down that hill because it's scary going thirty --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- miles an hour on a bike, I find it.  A lot of guys don't find it scary but I do.  And so what I visualized was, um, to -- um, I visualized that it would be cool day, slight overcast, a bit of a breeze, no heavy wind -- 'cause the first time I did it the wind was atrocious --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um, that's exactly what happened.  But I made the mistake of not visualizing the run -- the run -- I felt like I was --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- a potato in an oven.  
L:  Oh.
R:  It was hot --
L:  Oh gosh.
R:  -- there was no wind and this area usually has nice gales --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- blowing, you know -- [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  So, next year I'm visualizing the whole thing instead --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- of just --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- the -- just the bike. [NOISE] But anyway.
L:  How -- well, how hot was it?
R:  Um, well you're in the sun most of the time.
L:  Right.
R:  There's hardly any shade --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um, it -- it's a desert area --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, I don't really know but it felt like, you know, Palm Springs in the summer --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it -- that's how hot --
L:  Like a hundred and ten --
R:  -- it was.
L:  -- a hundred and twelve. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, and people were running --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with ice in their hats, I didn't do that, I wish I'd done that.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, I mean, I could only run maybe one third of it, I walked it.  Even the good guys were walking --
L:  Right.
R:  -- for long portions of it --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because it was so hot.  So, I felt real- --
L:  Yeah, Galloway recommends the -- the -- the walking anyway --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- says it makes for a better run.  I'm -- I know other people that say just the opposite but I thought --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it was interesting.  I mean, he's, you know, like, the guru for, you know --
R:  [LAUGH] Who?
L:  -- [inaudible] for training, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um -- well, how often do you run?  Uh, much more than I do, I guess.
R:  Well, I -- I don't call it going off the wagon, I just call it, you know, um, I -- I ease off for various reasons --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um, when I'm -- when I'm doing it -- it's, uh, every other day because what I do is --
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  -- I, um, I swim or bike on the off days.  And, um -- because I wanna make -- I made my bike much faster, I took off almost forty five minutes off the bike.
L:  Wow.
R:  And I took a lot of time off the run every though I walked a lot of it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I took -- I took time off, I did it for three minutes faster but next year I wanna do the whole run running and I wanna do [LAUGH] the swim faster and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the swim is my best event because I swim -- I'm a swim instructor but --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- if you do decide to --
L:  Go ahead.
R:  -- come and -- if you do decide to come and do this, um, practice running on sand and strange territory because the finish is an eighth of a mile of deep sand.
L:  Oh [LAUGH].
R:  Not -- not hard packed sand --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- de- ...
