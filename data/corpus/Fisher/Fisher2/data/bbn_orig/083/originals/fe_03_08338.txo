R:  Mathew Render.  Hello.
L:  H- hi.  Well, I'm a woman. [LAUGH] Joan Hawkins.  
R:  Hi.
L:  First time I've gotten a man on the phone [LAUGH] for doing this.  This is my third call.
R:  Okay.  How does --
L:  Have you d- --
R:  -- this work exactly?
L:  Huh?
R:  How does this work exactly?  I've never done this.
L:  Oh, you haven't done this?  
R:  No.
L:  Oh.  So, this is your first call, huh?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yep.  Um, we talk about the things they s- -- that were mentioned --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- in the thing and more than likely you and I will be on two different wave lengths on here because, um, I think by your voice you're probably, um, a lot younger than I am so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, I'm sure you're into health and fitness?
R:  Sure.
L:  Yeah, and -- well, I'm sixty two.  Gonna be sixty two.
R:  Okay.
L:  And I know the importance and the value but how this works is you just sort of talk about the subject and the things that were mentioned.  I don't think they evaluate that.  I think what they're doing is listening for the tones and the inflections and different things on their equipment.
R:  Mhm.
L:  At least that's what I've been led to believe.
R:  Okay.
L:  [LIPSMACK] And, uh, it's a matter of staying on the phone, uh, until they tell you your time's up. [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.
L:  So, that's how that works.  So, I guess I will, um, l- let you tell me about your r- regimen.  Do you exercise every day?
R:  Sure.  Y- -- I don't exercise every day.  I go to the gym, um, a couple of times a week.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and like lift weights and do cardi- -- like running and stuff on the treadmills.  And I also like active in sports; running outside, playing basketball and stuff.
L:  Now, um, [MN] I didn't get your name.  What's your name?
R:  Mathew.
L:  Mathew.  I have a grandson that's named Mathew and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I'm Joan.  And, um, you're probably what about in your twenties, thirties?
R:  Twenties.
L:  Twenties?  Oh, I did pretty good there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I have children.  They're in their thirties, for- -- and -- and, uh, thirties, thirty --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Thirty -- two -- two in the thirties and one in the forties. [SIGH] Um, [COUGH] probably when I was younger and your age that was never an awful big part of my life growing up.  I don't ever recall even being pushed so much back then.
R:  Sure.
L:  Um, it's c- -- cause I actually am, you know, a couple of generations from you here, um, if not more and, uh, [SIGH] due to health issues and everything I do realize the value of it.  However, I have neuropathy --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- which is a nerve disease in my feet and my feet are numb.  And so I -- there's nothing like having an excuse but for the last couple of years just walking has been very painful for me.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I'm at the point now where they may do some surgery [LIPSMACK] but, um, I do -- I do recognize the value of it.  I go to the chiropractor, um, and I have been informed -- I have gone through nutrition programs, I have gone through all kinds of things.  I, uh, haven't really gone on diet programs so I definitely should do that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I have actually got into, you know -- you know, how they have these things on the TV or -- or so- -- you know, things about you should try at work for -- that -- for health benefits or for losing weight.  So, I went into a -- a what was called an Oxycize[?] program.  I got the book.  Oh, I know, it was advertised in the Sunday paper [LIPSMACK] and they say if it sounds too good to be true it is. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I got it.  I guess sucker and so I've got a lot of -- with breathing exercises, um, getting levels of oxygen in your body and how that can help metabolize you and stuff like that.  It's just been a whole niff- different interesting program but unfortunately I haven't stuck with that either [LIPSMACK] and, uh, I try to do exercises.  Um, I try -- I've gone through periods where I try to eat better.  I suppose you eat very -- eat right foods?
R:  Sure, yeah.  I'm --
L:  Yeah, see now --
R:  -- pretty healthy in terms of what I --
L:  See now my children didn't really do that when they were in their twenties.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I -- my daughter, um, who's in her mid thirties tends to be more careful with that.  I don't think my son -- either of my boys do.  I don't know what it takes to get, um, good, um, values like that.  Were you raised with it --
R:  Um --
L:  -- for health values of ?
R:  I mean, not really.  It's just -- I feel like young people today are so like exposed to being healthy, you know.
L:  Yes.
R:  MTV and everybody's   You know, the --
L:  Everybody's --
R:  -- models.  Everybody's always working out and --
L:  Doing it.
R:  -- eating healthy.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So --
L:  Do you have something like that available through -- through your work?
R:  In -- what available?
L:  Uh, uh, equipment or do you have plans or programs?
R:  To work out?
L:  Yeah.
R:  No, nothing through work.  I just -- there's like loc- -- I live in New York City and there's just gyms on --
L:  Oh, yeah, I didn't ask you.  I'm up -- up --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- State New York.
R:  So, I'm in New York City.  There's a lot of gyms.
L:  I talked to someone yesterday from the Bronx.  So --
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's -- see there's a number you can call if you wanna get the phone calls over and done with you can just go ahead and make the call at your convenience when you have ten minutes --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- to give and, uh --
R:  How many can you do?
L:  You can only do three.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause someone that spoke to a friend of mine said that they, uh, they're -- they either did or they're gonna do it every month.  So, I wanted to know up front if that was how that worked and it doesn't work she said.
R:  Sure.
L:  Your number will come up and they'll say you are not allowed to participate any longer.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  They're gonna do another study, probably the same one; this is the second one, in September --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they will notify you, um, and you can, um, you can do it again.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, how did you hear about it?
R:  Just on a -- on -- on the internet actually.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  I was reading.
L:  You just came across it?
R:  Yeah, there was a posting.
L:  'Cause they gave me the website and it's really long.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So, I was just wondering how you just, you know.  H- I ca- -- got -- came through -- through a friend that saw it in a -- in a magazine.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, I -- I'm a phone person.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Guess you can tell that.
R:  No problem, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] So, it's easy for me but I wouldn't be a tele marker.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I wouldn't do that.
R:  No.
L:  But definitely -- you know, I keep reading these articles about the children and the obesity in children.
R:  Sure.
L:  And I'm concerned about that because one of my g- grandchildren, um, I'm afraid -- and I can tell you because you don't know me and don't know my family.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's not like, "Oh, boy, this is gonna get out".  But I can tell hasn't, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- had good nutritional habits and, uh, nor exercise and I can see this tendency and it concerns me and -- and even though I'm where I'm at and mayb- -- and not doing what I should I c- -- I start seeing all this now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Where things that can develop; health issues and all kinds of problems and so it is -- it's on my mind.  I really can't interject and do much about it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, uh, there is just so much that they're -- of course you know they're coming up with scientific things all the -- or, excuse me, cross that, studies all the time and a lot of it is with children where they, you know, aren't being taught and they're doing more in the schools.  In fact in our area the, um, elementary school is putting in a gym or is putting in a walk -- is putting in a, uh, [LIPSMACK] something like a treadmill or something for the children --
R:  Mhm.
L:  For the young children to do that they're -- they're renovating and they're doing something that will r- -- give them healthier habits and stuff.  They'll --
R:  Sure.
L:  They'll be doing this in their gym classes and stuff.  So some kids are gonna just be more or less forced into doing some [NOISE] of these programs, you know.  But, uh, a lot of it comes to the good nutritional habits beside the exercising every day or twice a week like you say.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, uh --
R:  No, I mean, it's the parents too.
L:  Right.
R:  What -- what they allow their kids to take for lunch.
L:  Well, that's what I mean and even though they can do different things in school if it's not, um, implemented at home too and if they don't, you know, watch what they eat and, um, try to enforce, uh, uh, better -- better food habits --
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, um, it's hard for me to say that because I have my own bad food habits too but it sounds you, um, at your age you really started getting a good start in your life as far as, uh, what you eat and --
R:  I try. [LAUGH]
L:  You know, I'm sure -- every -- every body has an off day where they like to really binge on their favorites or --
R:  Of course.
L:  [LAUGH] Whatever.  But, you know, as long as you recognize that and know that and -- and -- and don't make it a daily thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I still think that probably you can get away from that and you're recognizing that early and I guess as I look back and I wished I had.  I wished I had prob- -- I wish there'd been more of an emphasis.
R:  Sure.
L:  And I could've done more with it.  Not only in my own life but for my children.  Um, because now that I'm older I can see all that, uh, for myself as well as for my kids.  So, now I look at my grand kids who are young and I -- I get concerned over, uh, uh, some -- a couple of the families and the situations there.  But here again it's out of my control and, um, [LIPSMACK] so I guess that what they really just want you to know is just what you feel about it and what you do.  So, you need to do some talking now because they need to hear your voice.
R:  Yeah, no problem.  No, no, I mean, as I was saying, I mean, basically in terms of my health I try to eat healthy.  Um, stay away from like fast food.  I don't eat Macdonalds and stuff like that ever.
L:  Oh, you're kidding?
R:  I can't tell you the last time I had Macdonalds.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  Um, and --
L:  Good for you.
R:  And you know I go to the gym and I work out and I don't feel the need to go every day but, you know, just a couple of times a week it makes you feel good to sweat and just, uh, you know, when you live in the city and you work you wind up like sitting either at your desk or in front of a television a lot.  So, you know, whether going to like Central Park and go running or going to the gym and working out there.  To me it's like a little relief.
L:  Are you on your own or are you at home?
R:  Nah, I'm -- I'm single.  Yeah, I'm on my own.
L:  I mean --
R:  I have a girlfriend.  She works out all the time though[?].
L:  So, you have -- what I mean was you cook for yourself then?
R:  Oh, yeah, sure.  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, I pick up food or cook for myself and --
L:  Right.  Well, that's good.  Y- you --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- know my husband he [LAUGH] -- he's on these kicks and he likes Burger, um, Burger King and I have to really try and limit it and -- and one or two things at Macdonalds and so I've really tried and then we go away in the winter.  We winter away from here.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, down south and so it's easy to get into some really bad habits there.  But I cook.  I try to cook; make sure I have a variety of foods, not just all fat, not all -- you know, try to incorporate different things.  But, um, it's really hard.  I was gonna also tell you while we're talking if you know of other -- uh, just that it was passed along to me today.  If you know of other men -- young men, anybody that would be interested in doing this, she did tell me that they were looking for other men for the study.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, if you called that eight hundred number; that's how you got started, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  That, um, and -- and, uh, reef- --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Or, no if you gave this infor- -- that number to some other young man --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and gave them your pin number you would get credited for it.
R:  Okay.
L:  If you do ten you get five bucks. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, big deal.
L:  Uh, for one you get a dollar.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But they -- the study doesn't have enough men and I --
R:  Sure.
L:  "-- says, "Well, my husband isn't one of those.  He's not a talker.  
R:  Mm.
L:  He --
