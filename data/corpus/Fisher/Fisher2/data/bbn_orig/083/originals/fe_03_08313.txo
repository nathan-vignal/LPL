L:  Hi, I'm Josh and I'm --
R:  Hi, my n- --
L:  Oh, and I'm[?] from New York, so ...
R:  Oh, okay.  My name is George Anne and I'm in New Jersey.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Right across the river.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  What part of New York do you live in?
L:  Uh, I live in Brooklyn.  Right by Prospect -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Right by Prospect Park.
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay. [NOISE] Yeah, I'm out -- outside of Newark. [NOISE]
L:  Okay, yeah, my aunt lives --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- somewhere out there but I always --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- forget the name of the town. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Do you exercise regularly? [NOISE]
L:  Um, you know, I have a bike and it's really nice --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- right now outside or early in the morning when it doesn't get too --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- hot.  So I try to go on a bike ride about three --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or four times a week.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  And it's like five or --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ten miles but not really so much for exercise.  It's just kinda clearing my head.
R:  Right, right. [NOISE]
L:  Exercise is just kinda like a by product of it. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Exactly, exactly.  Well, I don't exercise regularly but I do walk a lot.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I used to exercise regularly and in fact at one time I was like into [NOISE] aerobics and I was on free weights --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and the whole bit and I really got like [NOISE] really addicted to it.  I mean, I, oh God, I wa- --
L:  What like getting all the buff muscles and everything or --
R:  Yeah.  I was like sheez[?].  I looked like a little small[?] Stretch Armstrong.  The female version.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Because [LAUGH] I ended up   Like at first I had a trainer and then I stopped doing it without the trainer.  It's just like anything else you end up --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- doing the things that you like to do, the things you do well.  So I was doing a lot of squats so my -- my butt and my --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- legs were getting really muscular --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which I'm short anyway and I'm petite and I work in retail I always had like big arms I guess.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, um, [LIPSMACK] oh, my God I looked terrible.  That's why I was doing all of them.  Kathy[?] this one and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- Jane Fonda.  I mean, I was really hooked on it.  I would wake up in the middle of the night and it'd be like [NOISE] one o'clock in the morning.  Oh, yeah, and --
L:  How much w- --
R:  -- exercise for like three hours.
L:  Y- --
R:  This was like years ago.  I mean, [NOISE] this is like going back a way. [NOISE] This is like over ten years ago. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, man.  So when did you stop exercising so much?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Was it just kinda like you woke --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- up one day.  Like, you know, "I just can't do this any more", or ?
R:  No.  I think it just happened gradually.  I started working [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, um, [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] working a full time job.  I was a store manager. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  So, I was still like working out perse but in a different way.  Like moving racks around [NOISE] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- picking up boxes on shipments and stuff like that.  So, I had less time to like play around at home and just like --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, do the aerobics thing.  You know, it was harder -- it got harder and harder to squeeze it in, you know.
L:  So that you're -- are you moving around a lot in your job now?  You work in retail, right?
R:  Okay.  Well, now, I'm -- I'm working, um, [NOISE] I'm self employed.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I do like credit repair, financial counselling.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I've been doing like a lot of like focus groups and consumer product testing.  You know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- like on the side. [NOISE] So --
L:  Yeah, that's what I've been doing too. [LAUGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, really?
L:  Yeah, I've been doing tons of focus groups --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I -- just like benign medical experiments.  You know, where nothing bad -- like none of the really invasive ones where they inject you with --
R:  Exactly, it's --
L:  So, I've been doing lots of that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- stuff and it's like 'cause I'm self employed.  I do lots of freelance writing so when it's slow I end up doing stuff like this. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  And I'm meeting some interesting people too. [NOISE] In fact I was thinking about, um, [NOISE] publishing like a list like for each area of just different places [NOISE] that you can go to --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- and like plant an ad [NOISE] in the newspaper and selling it.  So [NOISE] --
L:  So, as far as I could [several inaudible words] like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- medical experiments and focus groups and all that stuff, or --
R:  Yeah, mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  Man, there's so many out there.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, exactly, exactly.  'Cause I know a lot of people that -- well, I've met [NOISE] people that, um, [NOISE] like are on disability or --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- social security --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or whatever, retired.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  And they do it to supplement their, um, [NOISE] things --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know. [NOISE] So --
L:  Yeah.  Unfortunately it's becoming more of like [LAUGH] my primary income right now, but --
R:  Yeah, well, hey it's -- the money is out there. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, it's out there [inaudible].
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, we're --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- talking like about exercise.  So, um --
R:  I know. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, now change the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Uh, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, I'm only twenty four and so my --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- metabolism is still pretty much --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- going pretty high right now.  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm still about how much --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I weighed when I was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in high school.
R:  Yeah, well, you know what?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I -- I'm forty one.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Believe it or not and I have like seven kids.
L:  Oh, man.
R:  And [NOISE] -- but I'm like five four and one twenty five.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And some people are like, "Well, how do you do it?  How do you do it?"  'Cause --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But I guess part of it is like [NOISE] within yourself.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, I graduated high school in seventy nine. [NOISE] 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I look like pretty much the same. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know. [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] But hereditarily, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in my family, [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  On my mother's side, nobody's really fat. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know? [NOISE] My father's side's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a different story but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] You know, I think it's also too [NOISE] a want and a desire to maintain. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, because I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I had this guy who was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- twenty eight years old.  He was like coming on to me. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  [several inaudible words] 
L:  Mm.
R:  "You're looking pretty good.  You're holding girl".  I was like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, my God.  Really? [LAUGH] You know.
L:  Like -- like I'm thirteen years older --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- than you . [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, really. [NOISE] 
L:  I mean, it's the same thing for me.  I mean, it's like -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, it's not that I don't care --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- about my weight.  But, I mean, I always eat real healthy. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I eat lots of tofu and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- vegetarian products.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] And just try to monitor what I'm --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- eating and so I'm not sitting there and running to Macdonalds every day and like gouging myself --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- on the dollar menu.
R:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] Exactly, exactly.
L:  So, I can see myself --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- maybe doing a bit more exercise when I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- get a little bit older and the body doesn't quite digest the food as fast. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Well, you know what else too though; they say drink a lot of water.  Water and walking is really good.
L:  Well --
R:  'Cause like the water cleanses your body [NOISE] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of all the toxins and stuff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, [NOISE] you know, I'm not a vegetarian.  At one --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- point I was.
L:  [NOISE] Mm.
R:  And then I just eased --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- back into it, you know.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And [inaudible]. [NOISE] But, um, now I've found that I'm lactose intolerant and --
L:  Oh, ma- --
R:  -- I used to do a lot of the cheeses [NOISE] and the butter sauce and stuff like that. [SIGH]
L:  That happened to my mum.  She just woke up one day --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and then like [several inaudible words] gradually all of a sudden she realized she was lactose intolerant.  Like at fifty one years old.
R:  Yeah, I know.  And it's crazy because -- and how ironic this is.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Like my significant other [NOISE] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  He loves sweets.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  Okay?  And like he's forty eight now.
L:  Mm.
R:  Um, no he'll -- yeah, he's forty eight. [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  When he turned like forty six [NOISE] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  All of a sudden he's diabetic. [NOISE]
L:  Really?  See like adult onset --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- diabetes.  Crazy.
R:  Yeah, exactly. [NOISE] And the thing is that like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  His is not like really diet related or s- -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- anything.  Because like he plays ball.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, he plays with the eighteen year olds.  He's pretty good, [NOISE] you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And we walk a lot.  I mean, we used to walk the city like -- like crazy.
L:  I mean, that's what I do every single day. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I walk at least like four or five miles a day.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Listen, the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- longest walk I ever --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- walked and I don't know how he got me to do this and to -- to this day --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I swear to God it's the truth.  I walked from ninety first street in Central Park West --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- all the way down to the World Trade Center and I was seven months pregnant.
L:  Oh, man.  That's -- I can't -- that's such a long walk. [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  But we did it.  It was [inaudible] he was like, "Oh, no.  Let's go check out this".  And he just like kept egging me on.  Like, [NOISE] "Oh, come on.  Let's -- let's just go another couple more blocks and we'll get on the train at seventy second street". [NOISE] You know.  And then he goes, "Oh, no, no.  Let's check out Del's[?] barbeque".
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And then, "Let's go, um"   You know, and he really got me going.  I was like --
L:  Mm.
R:  Well, he goes, "Well, we're almost here now.  We might as well just walk the rest of the way".  You know I was like --
L:  [MN] I know, that's like --
R:  But let me tell you something.  I had no problem with my pregnancies.  I mean, like losing that weight afterwards and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I was all baby so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I didn't have that problem where, you know, [NOISE] you get   You know, people they have one child and then they like all of a sudden they blow up and they're --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- double the size. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And they blame it on the kid.
L:  Well, you've had like seven kids so I mean it sounds --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like you're doing real good for yourself as far as like maintaining.
R:  Yeah, and they're all the same father so he was like -- I had to fend him off after I had the baby.  Like, " [inaudible] we gotta wait". [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's bad. [LAUGH] 
L:  [inaudible] So, do your kids exercise much, or is ?
R:  Yeah, well, um, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I have four boys and three girls and --
L:  Uh-huh. [NOISE] 
R:  My one daughter, she was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- into some sports at school just for the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- workout routine.  Like she was in crew --
L:  Uh-huh. [NOISE] 
R:  She was playing tennis --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and stuff like that but, um, she stopped that and she -- she goes to a gym.  You know.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And she says that usually she's the youngest one in the class 'cause she's only sixteen.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] But she goes --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- sometimes like yoga and some other classes like there'll be like older ladies there and she says she would be in so much pain --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- sometimes.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But she would just do it just because she knew she had to like outdo these older people.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, how would it look?  You know.  So, that's pretty good. [NOISE] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.  And she's -- she's -- she's pretty, you know, she's pretty trim and sh- [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah, showing some --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- perseverance, you know.
R:  Yeah, exactly. [NOISE] [LAUGH] But --
L:  How do you --
R:  -- all my -- all my [NOISE] kids are pretty slim and stuff.  I've got one son that's got a little bit of a pudge but he's like [NOISE] nine.
L:  Oh, being no[?] nine years old I mean puberty hasn't even kicked it in yet.
R:  Exactly.  So --
L:  I mean, I had a little bit of a pudge when I was like nine, ten years old too.  Then --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- puberty kicked --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in and I was like rail thin after that. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, I know I went through a stage like in junior high school where I got kinda fat and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Not fat, fat but a little pudgy and s- -- and not sloppy but [NOISE] I always w- -- just wore the jeans and like -- like color jeans with a color jean jacket [NOISE] and I wasn't really like --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- dressing and stuff.  Like -- I was like really like [NOISE], you know, [NOISE] not dugware[?] I wouldn't call it but just like really casual.  And then after I got older --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It was like a different story, you know, I started dressing, you know.
L:  I forgot all about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- color jeans. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah. [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] Oh, my --
L:  You g- --
R:  -- little baby just gave me a kiss.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, I wonder what he wants.  My four year old.
L:  So, did you grow up in the city?
R:  No.  I grew up in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Jersey but I have family in the city so I was always going --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- back and forth to Jer- -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Uh, to the city.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  I went to school in the city [NOISE] too. [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  I went to Fordham [NOISE] -- Fordham at Lincoln Center.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] You know, my grandmother she lived, uh, [NOISE] she lived in the [NOISE] city.  She lived on hundred and thirty [NOISE] ninth street.  Then she --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- lived a hundred and sixteenth street.  Um, I always had like friends --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I worked in the city.  So, I was always going back [NOISE] and forth to the city.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] So, it was just cool.  Like I have an apartment at ninety first street that I had when I was sub leasing --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- on eighty seventh. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Between Amsterdam and Columbus which was like really nice. [NOISE]
L:  I mean, the city --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I think is an exercise program in and of itself. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Because who can afford to have a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- car really? [LAUGH] Like --
L:  Well, some days --
R:  I mean, like
