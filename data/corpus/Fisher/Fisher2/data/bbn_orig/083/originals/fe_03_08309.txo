L:  Hi.
R:  Hello.
L:  [NOISE] Hello.
R:  Hi, my name is Lorna.
L:  Hi, Lorna, I'm Sheila. [SIGH] 
R:  Hi.
L:  I -- How are you doing? [NOISE] [SIGH] 
R:  Okay.
L:  I -- good.  I didn't quite get the [SIGH] topic. [SIGH] 
R:  Um, the topic is do you think that students in public and private schools should be allowed to read whatever books they want.
L:  Ok- [NOISE] 
R:  Basically, should there be censorship --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- of school books that --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- [inaudible] even high school in private [NOISE] schools and public --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- schools?
L:  [SIGH] So --
R:  Um [COUGH] --
L:  -- tell me what you think. [NOISE] 
R:  Um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- what do I think?
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, well, yeah, I think that there should definitely be some kind of selection --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, uh --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I think any -- any kind of --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- there's any curriculum made of --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- somebody who thinks they have better judgment than, you know, the students themselves [NOISE] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- deciding [SIGH] -- and that -- maybe you can even call that censorship, right? [NOISE] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but, um, [NOISE] I don't know. [NOISE] It's kind of a broad topic.
L:  Yeah, I mean, I guess the way I look at it is I think the way the system works right now is pretty good, and that is that [SIGH] there are state committees of people who [SIGH] are, you know, pretty diverse [MN] who -- who choose public --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- school curriculum.
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH] And, [SIGH] you know, if that committee is representative, then [SIGH] I think that that is what have to represent the society at large.  Now, I guess if a parent has a problem with something a kid is --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- reading, um, I don't really know what they would do about that.
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] So --
R:  Well, um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I [MN] -- I don't know, I think that the question is more, like, if the kid wants to read something that --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the school would object to --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- should they be allowed to do it, you know, like --
L:  [NOISE] Well, I think --
R:  -- [inaudible] --
L:  -- parents ultimately have the -- have the -- should be deciding what their kids read, you know? [SIGH] Like --
R:  But, I mean, within that, uh, [inaudible], you know, like, I don't know, even at the -- you know, in high school, when --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you're supposed to be -- and -- and that just kinda like sends the message that, you know, you don't have faith in your child's judgment and then that might prevent them from maturing.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, um, like, becoming confident that they can make good decisions --
L:  [SIGH] Right.
R:  -- and things that are for them may be more important than, like, [inaudible] you pick up through here. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right, [MN] are you -- uh, do you happen to be a parent?
R:  No, I don't, I'm not --
L:  And me --
R:  -- a parent.
L:  -- me neither. [LAUGH] 
R:  So I --
L:  [SIGH] Me neither, so it's kinda hard to say, because I -- [SIGH] I mean, I think society has to have, like, sort of acceptable standards but I also [SIGH] believe that parents ultimately need to be watching what their kids are reading.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I wouldn't leave it completely up to the school.  Like, if you, as a parent, really object, [SIGH] well, then, I guess you go head to head with the school, I don't know what you would do.  Or the teacher, you know --
R:  Um --
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] but I like the idea --
R:  I don't know.  I'm thinking --
L:  Sorry --
R:  -- of a -- a movie, um, [NOISE] Donnie Darko [NOISE] have you seen that movie?
L:  What's it called?
R:  Donnie Darko.
L:  No, what's -- what is it --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- about?
R:  -- it's a really great movie.  Um, I mean, it's about -- it's kinda like -- it's about, uh, [inaudible] and time travel and then there was, like --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- there is one part of it -- I mean, there was one part of it where, um, a really religious, uh, teacher at a h- at a high school [NOISE] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- objects to the kids reading -- she's also a parent of a kid that goes to the school, and she objects to the, um, kids reading a Graham Greene story --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- 'cause she claims that it, um [COUGH] -- it -- it, like, caused somebody to, uh, vandalize the school and then --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- there's a -- the teacher who, uh --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- assigned that story to the class gets fired because --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- of it --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- so, um --
L:  Oh, I think that is just [NOISE] silly. [NOISE] I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [LAUGH] I mean, kids have got to be [NOISE] -- I'm not sure [SIGH] that protecting your kids is r- very helpful to them.  I think they have to learn how to deal with the world the way it is --
R:  Right.
L:  -- which -- which ain't easy. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  But, I mean, at least in the movie, it's the -- the teacher, or the -- the woman who's objecting to it, who's close minded in -- in her own way, like [NOISE] --
L:  Huh. [SIGH] Well --
R:  [inaudible], I don't know. [LAUGH] 
L:  No, it's -- it's interesting and, [SIGH] I mean, this is --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- actually a topic I've given thought to, and [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I don't -- I don't know, I mean, [SIGH] I like the idea that there's a common, um -- you know, that -- that kids -- I believe in standards, that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- kids should all, you know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- by junior year in high school have read To Kill a Mockingbird and had Shakespeare and, [SIGH] you know, there -- that each state has its mandated curriculum.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  But I guess if you live in -- I'm in California, where are you?
R:  Yeah, uh, me to, I'm in, um, the Bay area.
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] But I'm just thinking, like, if you lived somewhere in the south --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, I know there have been, even in recent history, [MN] you know, banning of certain [SIGH] curriculum -- I mean, certain --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- literature, so, [NOISE] here we're --
R:  But --
L:  -- so liberal. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, well, my friend worked in a Catholic high school --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- basically ran the place and, uh --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the curriculum -- it was very -- it was very conservative, like, she taught all the classes and, uh, there wasn't -- it wasn't a high school, I'm sorry, it was elementary school. [LAUGH] She wouldn't be able to teach all those classes, but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- for biology --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- she wasn't allowed to teach evolution, she had to --
L:  Right.
R:  -- teach creationism --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- which is, you know, absurd. [MN] But, so, in that kind of situation, like, if a kid was reading, you know, Darwin --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, you know, The Origin of Species, that's definitely against the school's curriculum --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so, should then the school, you know, what, censor --
L:  [SIGH] Well --
R:  -- or should y- you know, like --
L:  -- that's a private -- that's a private school's prerogative in my -- in my opinion, although, like I still think that's a private school's prerogative, I mean, they can do whatever they want to do, [SIGH] but, ultimately, like, no matter what [MN] private or public school, [SIGH] I think, and I'm Christian, [SIGH] I think you should teach both because then you're teaching a kid what -- you know, to make their own decisions.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I don't -- even if I [SIGH] were talking about a Christian school, I still would want to expose them to, you know, evolution because they need to know what that is.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Even though I don't necessarily believe in it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to, you know -- [SIGH] I actually do believe in it to some extent --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- 'cause I don't think they're mutually exclusive. [SIGH] 
R:  Okay.
L:  I don't know. [LIPSMACK] 
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah, I mean, I don't know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- or else, you know, a teacher sees a -- a kid reading [NOISE] some [SIGH] -- I don't -- I'm trying to think of -- you know, some [NOISE] book about drugs or -- or whatever.  You know, like, a porn book [LAUGH]  or something like that, should they take it away from them,?
L:  No, [MN] I mean, I only think that if it's -- maybe if it's like pornographic or something, there has to be some limits --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- but, no, for the most part I think -- I think a kid needs to be exposed to things.  What do you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- think?
R:  Um, yeah, and I think, [LAUGH] that where they get exposure is probably not from books, I mean, it's probably, like, TV and --
L:  Yeah, I think they're already --
R:  -- not that --
L:  -- exposed. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- like, [MN] --
L:  [SIGH] Unless it's --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- I don't know, unless the family is just really shrouding their kids, but [SIGH] I don't know, I just --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I'm not around that many school age children or anything, but --
R:  Yeah, that -- well, let's -- trying to think about this some more.  Should a school censor what students read?
L:  [SIGH] I don't know, I guess --
R:  I mean, if you censor, it just has such a negative connotation.
L:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] Y- I -- you know, it's funny, I was just thinking that myself.  The word censor isn't what I -- I mean, no, I don't believe in censorship, if you ask me that, of course not, but [SIGH] I do think that, um -- that, [SIGH] you know, groups of people can make very good decisions about what is a set of, [SIGH] you know, literature to read or, you know, whatever the curriculum is, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then, you know, you could make -- make some rules like, [SIGH] you know, we don't allow pornography in our school [LAUGH] or something.
R:  Yeah, and why not? [LAUGH] [MN] 
L:  Well, I mean, I think that's perfectly normal.
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  'Cause there has to be -- you know, there has to be some standards, you know, you can't have --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] kids just coming in with --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- anything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, you know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- m- m- [SIGH] magazines about --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- explosives [LAUGH] or something. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] That would probably be best to not have. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, and I remember in -- in high school in my --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- French class, [NOISE] we -- whenever we watched movies, there was a lot more [LAUGH] nudity in them. [LAUGH] That was the most, like [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, totally.
R:  [NOISE] so --
L:  [SIGH] I mean --
R:  -- we actually watched -- we g- we got to see it.
L:  Right, now what did your -- [SIGH] like, what was your school like?  Did they [SIGH] have --
R:  [MN] Um --
L:  -- I mean h- how did they --
R:  It was a --
L:  -- decide what --
R:  -- just a public high school.
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  I don't know, I mean, there was, you know, the curriculum set by the county.  It was actually a magnet high school so --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- it also had, like, all 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- this other, you know, curriculum, but, I mean --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- uh, there were books we read, it was, you know, basically, like, part of the [NOISE] [SIGH] [inaudible] nothing -- [SIGH] nothing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- surprising, nothing pornographic. [NOISE] Um, [SIGH] as far as I can remember, [NOISE] you kn-
