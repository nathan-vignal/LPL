R:  Hello.
L:  Hello. [SIGH]
R:  Hi.  What's your name?
L:  Uh, Sergio.
R:  Sergio.  How are you today? [NOISE] 
L:  Good.  What's your name?
R:  Noelle.  Just like Christmas.
L:  Oh.  So, how did you hear about this?
R:  Um, actually I heard about it online.
L:  [NOISE] Uh --
R:  How about you?
L:  Uh, same thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Starting to wonder if this is a, uh, if this is actually a legit study or if this is just some marketing ploy to figure out people's phone numbers --
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  -- and what time to call them during the day.
R:  No, I don't think so.
L:  You don't think so?
R:  I think it's legitimate actually.
L:  Really?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  How do you know? [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I know lots of people that have done it and who have gotten checks.
L:  Well, I mean, I've gotten checks but -- but, I mean, why do they have to ask you so many questions on the type of phone you use?
R:  Maybe for the reception?  And maybe --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- how it sounds.  I don't know.
L:  Huh.
R:  Yeah, I don't know.  I think it's legitimate.  We'll see.
L:  [NOISE] Well, maybe they're making money on the back end of marketing. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I don't know.
L:  Selling a list of people's names and phone numbers [SIGH] --
R:  I don't know.
L:  -- and the best time to reach 'em.
R:  Yeah, who knows?  I mean, we -- couldn't you just get that from a call list; any call list?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You wouldn't think they'd be paying ten dollars per phone call for that.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, but the thing is I've done this a lot more than three times and I've only gotten paid twice so I'm just -- I don't know.  
R:  Mm.
L:  It's just --
R:  I think c- --
L:  Anyways.
R:  Can't you only do it three times?
L:  [NOISE] Well, I don't think so.  I mean, I did it three times -- like I did three real quick ones --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then it took me like months and I finally got paid for two of 'em only.  So --
R:  Hm.
L:  I don't know.
R:  I don't either.  So, do you work out?
L:  [NOISE] Yes, I do.  Uh, work out --
R:  What do you do?
L:  I guess I'm a real, uh, work out freak actually.
R:  Hm.
L:  I work out -- I over work out.  How about you?
R:  I, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I work out regularly.
L:  [NOISE] You do?
R:  Yeah, mhm.  I'm -- I'm certainly not an o- -- a workout freak by any means.  I have two small kids and they keep me working out just keeping up with them every day and, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I like to go really --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to relax.  I go work out to relax and I do --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- kick boxing and spinning and, uh, lift weights.
L:  Uh, so, that's good[?].
R:  How about you?
L:  I, uh, I -- I run.  I work out.  I play sports.  Um, I just have this thing where I mean, it -- it depends I guess [NOISE] -- I've been working out basically my whole life and I've been playing --
R:  And how old are you?
L:  I'm twenty eight.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I've been playing sports, you know, I played in high -- in high school and college and everything so I just don't wanna be this dad that can't [NOISE] play with his kids.  You know what I mean?
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] So, I guess that's my, uh, big goal in life is to be sixty and still be able to [NOISE], I don't know, do a hundred pushups and -- and run and do everything else.
R:  Mhm.  Do you have kids?
L:  No. [SIGH] Nope.  No kids.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [inaudible].  How old are you?
R:  How old am I?  I'm thirty two.
L:  Thirty two.
R:  Mhm. [LIPSMACK] I have a two and a four year old. 
L:  Two and a four year old.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, that's something.  That's a lot of -- you still have time to work out?
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Uh --
R:  Yeah, I -- I manage to find time.  Like I said it's my -- it's my way to relax really.  I'm a single mom.
L:  Mm.
R:  And, um, so it's expensive to get a sitter and for me to go to the gym and   I can drop them off there for a couple of hours and it's really -- it's relatively quality child care --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, I just, you know, can relax and work out.  Do a class, go to the sauna.  That sort of thing.
L:  Do you think people work out more for vanity reasons or people work out 'cause they simply like working out?
R:  Well, I work out, um, 'cause I feel better.  I don't know.  I mean --
L:  Did you play sports?
R:  I didn't.  No.
L:  No?
R:  Mm mm.  I wasn't real athletic.  I mean, I played soccer as a child --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And -- but I wasn't involved on any sport teams in high --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- school. 
L:  What did you --
R:  I was more of the kind of, um, I don't know   I studied a lot and I was on the newspaper staff and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- was in choir and, um, theater; that kind of thing.
L:  [NOISE] Uh, okay.
R:  So, I wasn't in the whole sports crowd.  But if I -- if I had a chance to do it again I would've definitely and I hope my kids -- I hope my boys are involved in sports. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] I see.  Yeah, 'cause I always noticed people that didn't do sports they just complain on their workout 'cause to them it's more of a hassle --
R:  Really?
L:  So they have, um, well I mean, there's another case for you but, um 
R:  Yeah, they don't have the love for it that people --
L:  Yeah, they just sort of --
R:  -- who played sports do?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Although I think there's a difference between team sports and working out.
L:  Oh, yeah.  No there's definitely -- I'd rather play team sports any day --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of the week than --
R:  Right.
L:  -- working out.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Working out is actually kind of boring.
R:  Yeah, it can be.  That's why I do classes because it -- they're at least a little more interesting and [SIGH] it's -- even though it's not a group -- group thing there -- there's sort of some group pressure to keep up and perform and I love -- I love kick boxing.
L:  Why do you think the US -- why do you think we're so much over ra- -- overweight compared to any of, uh, most other countries yet --
R:  I think it's all the fast food actually and all the sedentary lifestyle.  I mean --
L:  Yeah, I -- I don't --
R:  -- that's kind of --
L:  It's -- it's just --
R:  The way they -- the foo- -- the stuff that they market to kids and the food that they have out for kids nowadays it's no wonder that there's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- such high obesity among children. [NOISE] 'Cause it's all about [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] Macdonalds -- okay, I will as soon as I'm done with this phone call.  It's all about Macdonalds and, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, the crazy yogurt that's, um, neon blue and -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean, they just market just junk to kids and so the kids eat it and the moms are most, you know, a lot of moms are working so the kids are --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- at home with the sitter and they're thrown in front of the TV or the computer or their gameboy and --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I agree.
R:  It's just a cycle.
L:  Kids today would rather play on their Sony Playstation than go out and --
R:  Right.
L:  You know, [NOISE] play a game of tag or something.
R:  Right, yeah.  We were without power.  I live at -- up around Chicago --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, we were without power for four days and so [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] we didn't have air conditioning and, you know, anything [NOISE] and so -- Kelly[?], shh.  And so, um, [LIPSMACK] I -- the kids were outside a lot; more than usual even and it's been really good because it made me realize how much, you know, they would watch movies and they would watch a movie in the morning and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, it's really made me realize that they just have just as much fun being outside, if not more fun, just being outside, you know, there's --
L:  [NOISE] Right.  I agree.
R:  It's so easy to take the route of, "Let's put on a movie so I can get some stuff done".
L:  Yeah, yeah --
R:  And --
L:  I can see that.
R:  Instead of just going outside and playing and -- and I don't think my kids are even --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- an extreme in that whole situation.  I -- I try to really limit what they watch and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  They don't have any video games and that sort of thing.  But --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, it's easy -- it's certainly as a young parent it's easy to just kinda be like, "Okay, you just sit in front of the TV so that I can get some stuff done".
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  But --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I've always thought it's interesting how many people get, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Getting back to health clubs; how many people buy memberships and then maybe only -- I don't even know the percentage, twenty percent use 'em.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  So -- but I'm sure when you're working forty, fifty hours a week and if you have kids or, uh, any sort of outside life it's tough to get to the gym for an hour, hour and a half.
L:  Yeah, I know. [MN] [inaudible].
R:  Do you go in the morning or at night?
L:  Um, I go -- no, I -- I usually go at night after --
R:  After work?
L:  Yeah.  [MN] I just --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- feel guilty being in a gym during the day.  Just feel like you're missing out on doing something [NOISE] else.
R:  Oh.  Do you work during the day?
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] So, [LIPSMACK] um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Would you buy, uh -- this is a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- totally odd question but, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Would you buy --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, some type of insurance policy that if you got sick --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that you -- if you lost your job you would still have access to your membership, um, that would be paid for do[?] gym?
R:  Um, [NOISE] probably not. [NOISE] Well, my -- I work at home so for me that wouldn't really -- wouldn't really relate.
L:  Oh, okay. [NOISE]
R:  So --
L:  Just seeing, uh --
R:  Yeah, I don't know.
L:  -- importance level of --
R:  I --
L:  No, what's weird is like --
R:  I don't know.
L:  Every other junk mail you get is about a diet or a health fad or something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- yet the US has this extreme obesity [NOISE] plague behind it.  And then these other countries you don't see as much of these diet products.
R:  Right.
L:  These fat free products --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and people aren't as fat. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  It's kinda funny.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, it's -- it's just -- it's amazing --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- how many obese people live in the US.  I just -- just don't get it.
R:  Yeah, but if you walk through a grocery store you'll see all the [NOISE] -- the products that are making people so fat and -- and, [NOISE] um, fattening food is so much cheaper than healthy food.
L:  That -- that's true.
R:  So, [SIGH] that's probably part of it too. [NOISE] 
L:  I think, you know, I think people are just lazy.  I think -- I -- I --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  I believe people could eat fast food every single day of their life as long as they run and do something they'll be all right and as long as they eat in normal quan- -- quantities.
R:  Mm.
L:  The problem is that you super size everything.  Your cokes nowadays come in one liter bottles and they're normal.
R:  I know. [LAUGH] 
L:  I mean, Jesus Christ, you don't need --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You just need, you know, ten ounces.  That's it.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, um --
R:  Or some water.
L:  I think that's what it is.  I think people forget that the most important thing is
