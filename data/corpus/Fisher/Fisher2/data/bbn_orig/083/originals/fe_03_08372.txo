R:  Hi, this is Joanie Sprent[?].  [SIGH]  And this is the first time I've done this and to answer your question, [SIGH] yes, I do work out regularly, [SIGH] almost every day, probably five days a week.  [SIGH]  And I usually, ah, do the, um, +elliptical -- elliptical machine or sometimes I do the treadmill.  [SIGH]  Very rarely do I bike, [SIGH] although [SIGH] I'm very interested in starting to spin class, [SIGH] ah, which is on bicycles and you do it to music and it's more of a group participating, [SIGH] type of a thing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I'm i- interested in doing it that way because [SIGH] I want to exercise all the group -- body groups [MN] and [SIGH] I don't -- I feel like the more variety I have the more muscles I'm li- -- likely to strengthen and tone [SIGH] in addition to which [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [COUGH] excuse me, [SIGH] um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [NOISE] ah, I -- it, um, your body gets used to certain types of exercise so you really do need a v- variety of different aerobic activities [SIGH] in order to [NOISE] ... stay fit and to keep your body, I guess, kind of ... jumping.  [SIGH]  I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] am a little concerned about doing spin class though because I really hurt [SIGH] my neck and my back [SIGH] and my shoulder --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] in, ah, a car accident.  I was in t- three car accidents [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- within a six month period in nineteen, u- um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [MN] two -- the year two thousand --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH], ah, none of which were my fault.  The first one happened on a real snowy day and the guy --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] couldn't help, -- um, he just slid right into me [SIGH] this -- and that one I recovered from relatively quickly.  I was back to work within a week or so.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  The second car accident --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- somebody was [SIGH] -- c- collecting money --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on the street for the Policemen's Association and the car in front of me stopped.  [SIGH]  I stopped [SIGH] but then the man in front of me -- behind me [SIGH] hit me.  I didn't hit anybody but he hit me.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  [MN]  After that accident [SIGH] I came back to work a day or two later but I was really so injured I wound up going out on disability, [SIGH] a- and maybe a month or so later [SIGH] and I actually never went back.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Um, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- honestly I really don't think [SIGH] -- in fact I know I can't do any type of, ah, office work at all ... anymore, [SIGH] or sit behind a desk [SIGH] because that really hurts my neck.  [SIGH]  Um, [COUGH] [MN] and it's sad because I was really good at it and I enjoyed it.  [SIGH]  Ah, what I do find though, [NOISE] and what prevents pain is back to the initial topic [SIGH] is exercising.  It makes me feel great.  I'm not on any painkillers.  I'm not --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] on any type of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- patch.  Occasionally I'll have to take an ... Advil but the more active I am the better I feel and [SIGH] exercise is the one thing I really enjoy.  [SIGH]  I, um, [SIGH] [MN] [SIGH] I love it.  I don't need a partner to go -- a lot of people need partners [SIGH] to go with.  [SIGH]  I don't need a partner.  I can exercise just fine without somebody [SIGH] m- motivating me to go.  I motivate myself to go and it takes no motivation at all [SIGH] for me to go to the gym.  It's something I really love.  If anything [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's hard sometimes for me to stop because I love that ... endorphin rush so much.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  I -- on the other hand dieting is something I absolutely hate.  I hate the self +deprivation.  My favorite thing in the whole world to eat is c- candy and ice cream and [SIGH] cookies.  I'd rather eat that for dinner [LAUGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or breakfast or lunch but anything that's nutritious.  [SIGH]  So, it's very frustrating and it feels very, very depriving not to eat the food I want.  [MN]  And, unfortunately, since I'm not naturally thin --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I really do have to watch --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- my weight.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  I --
L:  I see.  [NOISE]
R:  That's very difficult.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [MN]  Oh, ...  [NOISE]
R:  Hello?
L:  Um, yeah, yeah, I'm here.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  Um, [NOISE] my name is Narage[?].  [NOISE]  U- um, [MN] I do a lot of cardio ... [NOISE] [SIGH] weight training, pretty r- regularly.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  U- um, lately I've taken up swimming.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  And, ah, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a lot of exercise in the pool.  [NOISE]  Ah, I find I enjoy swimming.  [NOISE]  Um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [NOISE] I -- I -- I have a question for you, ma'am, um, --
R:  Sure.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [NOISE] ah, [SIGH] [NOISE] are you -- r- regarding your accident, ah, I'm really sorry to hear that.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  Um, do you find --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it hard for you to, ah, [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] do you stick to, ah, mostly cardio exercise [NOISE] now, or do you, ah, try to get weight training in there as well?  [MN]
R:  First of all I have to apologize.  I had no idea somebody else was on the phone with me.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And I thought I had to speak for ten minutes.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, no, --
R:  This is --
L:  -- no, no, I think the way this works is we're supposed to have a conversation.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, wow!  That's --
L:  But, you -- well you seemed pretty enthusiastic, so I let you go at it.  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]  Well, I actually wrote down notes of things to talk about 'cause I thought, "God, ten minutes is a long time to talk".  [SIGH]  It --
L:  Oh, no, if [LAUGH] -- if you talk with somebody else it goes --
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  -- by real fast.
R:  -- much better.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  I -- no, actually I've really -- I've only done cardio and, --
L: [NOISE]
R:  -- um, because [SIGH] my son's bar mitzvah was June seventh [MN] --
L:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I didn't want [NOISE] to, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, in any way to injure myself and I wanted to look the best I possibly could.
L:  Right.  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Now that it's over I -- I do have a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- funny you should say that, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- 'cause I do have an appointment for next Thursday to start --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] a weight lifting routine.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  That really scares me.  I'm very --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- 'cause I always get injured --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and then I can't go back to the gym.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, jeez.  [SIGH] [NOISE]
R:  What --
L:  So you have to -- you have to -- I suppose you have to be really careful ... [NOISE] on the kind of exercises that you do?  [NOISE]
R:  Extremely.  [NOISE]
L:  Wow!   [NOISE]
R:  I -- I actually started off in the pool.  I was doing water aerobics and running in the water.
L:  Right.  Right.  I'm just getting into that now.  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  How [NOISE] -- may I ask do you run in the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- water?
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, I -- I just -- just started that [NOISE] a week and a half ago and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] it -- it -- it's -- it's te- -- it's surprisingly e- effective.  I mean I, [SIGH] you know, --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- you know, ah, usually [SIGH] I -- I -- I see elderly people doing it and I go well, "No, that's not for me".  [SIGH]  But, now I, you know, I'm watching people doing it a- and I tried it myself and it -- it -- it [NOISE] works and gets you tired.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Ah, it really --
L:  So, ...
R:  -- works.  You can actually buy, [SIGH] ah, headsets.  Sony makes it.
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH]  You can that -- it's not waterproof but it's water resistant.
L:  Right.
R:  You can put it under water [SIGH] but I used to run with that on.  [SIGH]
L:  Well, that -- that's a good idea.  [SIGH]  'Cause when I get on the treadmill, I mean, I h- have well usually, ah, [SIGH] some sort of Walkman or MP three player and that keeps me going, or even when I run.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  But under water, ah, you know, you just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- not much to keep you going.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Right.  No, you have to, um, [SIGH] yeah, Best Buy has it.  I don't know if there's a Best Buy by you but --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  -- and it's -- it's yellow.  It's by Sony.  It's ... got -- it's got a radio.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [MN]  I think also it picks up television but that's --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- there [SIGH] and you can [LAUGH] actually run with it on and you can't put your -- you can't submerse yourself but if somebody splashes you --
L:  [MN]  Right.
R:  -- or some water's kicked up it will be fine.
L:  [MN]  Wow!
R:  [SIGH]  And it's guaranteed for that.
L:  That -- that's pretty good.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  And make it much easier.  Now, are you taking --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- water aerobic classes?  [SIGH]
L:  No.  No.  Should I be?  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Ah, but, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's a lot of old people.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, [NOISE] that's what it seems, r- right n- now.  [LAUGH]
R:  Where do you work out at?  [NOISE]
L:  Ah, the local gym.  [SIGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  NBS.
R:  Can you just tell me the name?  I -- I'm not --
L:  What's that?
R:  -- going to ask you any other questions.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Can you tell me the name?
L:  Oh, it's just -- it -- it's just, ah, Valley's Fitness Center.
R:  Oh, okay.  [MN]
L:  There's the Valley's and then we have a club near by.  [NOISE]  And ... [NOISE] yeah, it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I -- I mean ... t- the younger folks usually d- do the laps [SIGH] and the older people [SIGH] just do the water jogging and so.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But if I get in the water jogging lane it -- it works, huh?
R:  It -- my -- a friend of mine has [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- rheu- -- rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia [SIGH] --
L:  Right.  [MN]
R:  -- and she ... has only been -- I ... graduated --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- from there.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I graduated myself and went back into the gym.  I like real high pace.  [SIGH]
L:  I see.  [LAUGH]
R:  A- and, ah, as you can tell I have a lot of energy.  I need to get rid of s- [LAUGH] some of it.  [SIGH]
L:  Right.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Um, [NOISE] but she looks amazing.  And she runs -- she was running a mile [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in the water which I did too.  That really not -- it's sixty four laps in their regular pool.
L:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
R:  And it's really not the -- as hard to do as you think it is, once you get into the rhythm.
L:  R- right.  R- right.  [SIGH]
R:  But don't start off with that.  [SIGH]
L:  Y- yeah, [LAUGH] I know.  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  I'll start off slow at first.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  It's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what made you choose the water --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- over regular ...?
L:  [LIPSMACK]  I -- I just needed a change of pace.  I mean I [SIGH] -- I was on the spinning machines just like you were and, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [NOISE] ah, I jog --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I -- I just got t- tired of it.  It wasn't appealing to me anymore and I said, "Well, [SIGH] if I'm going to keep exercising I need to do something new".
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I decided to go with water.  Y- yeah, it -- it -- it di- -- it's certainly different, I mean, --
R:  [NOISE]  It's very different.  I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I've done the kind of tedious [NOISE] running in the water [NOISE] --
L:  Right.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- which --
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah, definitely.  [LAUGH]
R:  Does your [NOISE] health club have one of those, [SIGH] um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't know what it's called, where -- there's all the TV monitors and you can tune -- you plug in your headphones and you exercise [NOISE] to that.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, they have that on the -- on ... well they -- in the, ah, on the Stairmaster, ah, I mean the room with the Stairmaster and the treadmills [SIGH] and, ah, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you -- you can --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- you can choose -- you can choose what ch- -- they have all the TV monitors lined up, right.
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH]  And you can p- plug in.  You can choose which one you listen [NOISE] to.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  And, yeah, that -- that c- certainly helpful.  [SIGH]
R:  Ah, it's -- ah, see I'm -- [LAUGH] I'm really weird.  I like to go [SIGH] -- if I go at three o'clock I catch Dr Phil and I [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- or Oprah.  [SIGH]
L:  O- [LAUGH] o- oh!  [LAUGH]
R:  And I can go and keep going and during commercials I try to put on real fast music.  [SIGH]
L:  I s- [LAUGH] s- see.  [LAUGH]
R:  And I have trouble keeping my heart rate down enough.  [SIGH]
L:  O- o- oh!
R:  But, ah, I really like that and the weekends it -- it's the best thing that you can e- exercise to music with some sporting activity on.  [SIGH]
L:  Right.  Right.  [SIGH]
R:  'Cause the better the sport the more it motivates [NOISE] you to really go.
L:  [LAUGH]  Y- yeah, --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- seeing all those athletes pro athletes on the screen.  [SIGH]
R:  I don't know it's [NOISE] --
L:  [SIGH]  No, I -- [SIGH] I go around prime time and [SIGH] [NOISE] usually, you know, some -- ah, they'll --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, I'll tune into --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- something like, Jeopardy or Wheel of Fortune [SIGH] and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [SIGH] I -- I found that bringing my own music helps instead because I [SIGH] really get involved in the -- the game show, rather than --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- concentrating on exercising.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  That I can imagine.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Now, see [SIGH] we also have access to music through the same -- t- through the, ah, [LIPSMACK] the -- the, ah, -- it -- it's part of, ah, mon- -- it's part of the channels for the monitor to --
L:  I see.
R:  -- for the TVs [SIGH] so we also have five music stations so, --
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, that -- that's pretty good.
R:  -- yeah, I can flip --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- through them like I do in the car real fast.
L:  Oh, so -- so folks don't have to bring their own MP three players or anything like that?
R:  Right.  Not only that but you get a variety of music.  [SIGH]
L:  All right, so that's a good deal.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  Go -- it's Cardio Theater what it's -- what it's called.
L:  Oh, Cardio Theater, no, we don't have those around here.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  No.  [LAUGH]  The Elliptical machine is usually [SIGH] -- ah, we don't have too many of those.  [SIGH]  And there's usually a [NOISE] l- line to use those.  I don't know what's so wondrous about it but, ah, I mean p- perhaps you can vouch for it?  Does it really ... work wonders?
R:  It's amazing.  I can't tell you [NOISE] -- [SIGH] I don't really see [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- much of a difference between that and the treadmill, but the --
L:  [NOISE]  Okay.
R:  -- elliptical machine [SIGH] [NOISE] -- as I said I like the endorphin rush a lot --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and the elliptical --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- machine really gives it to you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it just feels --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- g- great and it --
