R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Hi.
L:  Go ahead.  Hi.
R:  [LAUGH] My name's Chris.
L:  My name is Veronica.
R:  Hey, Veronica. [NOISE] [SIGH] Um, I [NOISE] uh, [MN] didn't hear the topic, can you tell me?
L:  It was do we think --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it's okay for schools to --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- require children to [MN] -- to read particular books.
R:  Oh, okay. [SIGH] All right, well, [NOISE] how do you feel about that? [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] n- no. [LAUGH] 
R:  No. [LAUGH] 
L:  I mean, just because --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, as a mom --
R:  [NOISE] Okay.
L:  -- I mean, there is just some books that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I don't feel that my kids need to read.  I mean, I don't know what they are, but [SIGH] I think we --
R:  Right.
L:  -- should have the opportunity to know and to read 'em or glean over 'em or research them --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- before --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they make them read a certain book.
R:  Sure, uh, yeah, I agree.  I think, um, [SIGH] I am glad [MN] I was made to read the few books that I was made to read in -- in high school, like To Kill a Mockingbird and, [NOISE] [SIGH] you know, stuff like that, so, um, [NOISE] [SIGH] it's good to have some of the classics be standards.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, I agree, but nowadays that -- you know, they go and they --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- how many -- f- from what -- I don't know for sure --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- but from what I understand, I guess a lot of the classics have been [LIPSMACK] modified.
R:  Sure.
L:  So, you know, I mean, what --
R:  Yeah, we don't want that. [NOISE] 
L:  -- I mean, what interp- you know, who's interpretation is it?
R:  [SIGH] Right.
L:  I mean [MN] [SIGH] --
R:  I think that's a good point, um --
L:  So, I don't know. [SIGH] 
R:  [SIGH] I actu-
L:  It's just --
R:  -- I hope the --
L:  -- the ways schools are these days [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- it's kind of scary. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] I actually home school my --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- son, he's, um, seven, so [SIGH] um, you know, I guess, w- I pick the topics of books, um, [LIPSMACK] that he reads. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  But, no, I mean --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- he has a standard too --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- but, um, [SIGH] I don't know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I think when you get into government picking books [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I don't know, I'm -- unless it's, like, a classic, that's pretty much all I can say, it's, like, if it's a classic [SIGH] [MN] that is, like --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, of --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- of really strong literary value, then --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'd --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- be willing for that but --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- but, yeah, if --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- if y- I -- I haven't heard somebody say that they've -- like, are different editions or different translations, so.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, I h- even heard on different groups that if you go to buy a book on, like Amazon dotcom, make sure you -- you -- you know what version you're getting [SIGH] so --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- that's what made me think about that.
R:  Oh, that's really interesting. [NOISE] 
L:  That is interesting. [SIGH] So --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it's just, [NOISE] you know, like, anybody [NOISE] can, you kn- [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- pick up a book --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and say, "Well, you know, let's take this out and add this and "
R:  Right, yeah --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that's no good.  You want what the original --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- author wrote, I expect.
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH] Huh, well, [LAUGH] huh. [NOISE] Are -- [MN] are you --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- have your kids experienced this yet?
L:  No.
R:  You have --
L:  My oldest is in fourth.
R:  Okay. [NOISE] 
L:  Soon to be fifth and, you know, it's, like, read a book and do a book report.
R:  Yeah, and he's got f-
L:  But I'm --
R:  -- free choice.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Right, but in high school I know we -- you know, I had to read [NOISE] certain books.
R:  Yes.
L:  And I couldn't even tell you what they are, but --
R:  I know, I think there --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- was some Shakespeare. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  You know, like, Romeo and Juliet.
L:  I don't even remember.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  And, I mean, I'm -- I'm thirty one, but [MN] it's just been forever, it seems.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah, yeah.  Well, yeah --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- I y- have -- I don't, um -- [SIGH] I don't like a lot of government interaction with my children.  I think that they're head-
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- headed kinda down the wrong road, so  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH] So [NOISE] -- 
L:  Yeah, I know, I [MN] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I mean, I -- I [NOISE] commend you for --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- home schooling your kids, [NOISE] I keep --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- wanting to [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- but it's just like, "Oh, my gosh".  So, [LAUGH] I'm basically like "Well, give them a reason [MN] for me to take them out of school".
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, read John Hoult, [NOISE] and, uh, he's got a real good theory [SIGH] and we're supposed just to [NOISE] stay on the topic, but [LAUGH] --
L:  Well, it's about reading. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, [NOISE] reading John Hoult, yeah, he talks about, um, you know, h- like, schooling and home schooling and stuff like that. [NOISE] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, and, I mean, my mom did the R- Robinson curriculum --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] so I have a list of books that he used to teach his kids.
R:  [NOISE] Oh --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- what is that?
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] I haven't heard of that.
L:  [NOISE] The Robinson curriculum?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] I don't know, you could do a search of it online.
R:  Okay.
L:  But he taught his kids by --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- just different books [NOISE] and a lot --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of them [NOISE] are the classics [NOISE] and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- think --
R:  If you can handle having your kids [NOISE] home all day. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah [NOISE] --
R:  You know.
L:  -- I know, but I'm just --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I'm -- I'm by myself so [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's just too much stress to try to --
R:  Right.
L:  -- figure out how I'm going to feed 'em and [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  -- that's what's making it crazy for me, but --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [NOISE] I'm trying. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, no, if you're by yourself --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [NOISE] I'm glad I've got some money coming in, for sure.
L:  Right. [SIGH] 
R:  So --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [NOISE] it's --
L:  -- I keep telling my kids, "If you guys will read and listen to me and [NOISE] [SIGH] maybe we can do this, but " [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah. [SIGH] Yeah, it's great.
L:  [MN] 
R:  [NOISE] It's great.
L:  [NOISE] W- [MN] --
R:  It's great to have a support group too.
L:  [SIGH] Well, I may have to do my son this year, 'cause he misses the t- the cut off date by seven days.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, I'm like, "Wait a second, you know, he's going to be six in kindergarten, that's kind of, you know --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- dumb". [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I'm probably going to end up doing that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Well, and if they --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, were going to make him read anything --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- in kindergarten [SIGH] how would you feel about that? [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] It's a -- 
L:  You know, uh, the books that -- I remember reading certain books [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in that -- in those grades, in kinder- well, not really kindergarten, but first --
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  -- and my daughter never did any of that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  She --
L:  And they were just those --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- books, you know, I've forgotten --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the r- rhyming ones.
R:  Uh, oh, the rhyming, like, Dr Seuss, or ? [NOISE] 
L:  No, the -- like [MN] [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE] [MN] 
L:  -- [SIGH] like Anne is in the Van, or you know --
R:  Okay. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- something [LAUGH] dull[?]. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] I don't remember.
R:  Yeah, that's funny, I don't remember that either. Um, [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] well --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- yeah, d- I don't know, I don't have much more to -- like, I'm trying to think of, like, other -- like, [NOISE] let's see --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- school picking out books, like, [NOISE] I feel like I've said pretty much all that there is to say [NOISE] about that. [NOISE] 
L:  Right, and then, I mean, college, well, I mean, hopefully by then --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they kinda know --
R:  Right. [NOISE] It's -- it --
L:  -- even if they do a book that maybe it's not true or --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it's [MN] crazy thinking and --
R:  Right, and --
L:  -- 'cause that's what I have [LAUGH] to do.
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] [SIGH] Yeah, it -- yeah, it's all very formative, you know, like, [NOISE] whatever they pick out for you to read, it's [NOISE] -- it just feels like [NOISE] big brother, you know, "Read this. [NOISE] Now read this". [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah, I -- I understand --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- what you're saying.
R:  [NOISE] Like Orwellian. [NOISE] [SIGH] Um, so --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- but, I mean, I like that they're [NOISE] -- like, uh, [NOISE] what --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I like [NOISE] when they pick out a book, like, uh, Shakespeare, is [NOISE] otherwise I may never have, like, [NOISE] understood it, because it's nice to be in [NOISE] a class situation [SIGH] and I happened to have a really good [NOISE] teacher [NOISE] and, uh --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, it was helpful --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it -- it -- it made me really appreciate Shakespeare, as opposed to like, God this is just --
L:  Boring.
R:  -- so -- yeah, boring, [NOISE] [SIGH] which it can be if it's not, you know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] if somebody doesn't liven it up for you, so, [SIGH] um -- so for that I was glad that they picked out a book and told me 
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH] But --
L:  Yeah, my senior -- I remember my +senior -- senior English teacher, [LIPSMACK] he was just awesome --
R:  Uh, yeah.
L:  -- he'd have us read a book and [SIGH] read a chapter, write about it, talk about it.  First talk about it, then write about it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] and that was like, [SIGH] my favorite class.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, that's so nice when you actually get a really great teacher.
L:  And I don't even -- [SIGH] I had r- I had saved all my essays [MN] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for a couple of years. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, r- [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] I know.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Just because I got As on 'em, but --
R:  That's awesome. [NOISE] 
L:  -- I threw 'em away. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh. [NOISE] 
L:  So, I don't remember what book it was.
R:  [NOISE] Oh. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] It was just kind of funny.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] And what -- where do you live?
L:  Arizona.
R:  Arizona.  We're in, uh, [MN] Los Angeles. [NOISE] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] So, how's uh --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- [NOISE] God, the --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I wonder if they mind if you get off the topic, it's so hard to stay on --
L:  I don't know --
R:  -- a topic.
L:  -- but I did get a check from them.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, good, [LAUGH] okay, this is the first time, ever. [LAUGH] 
L:  This is my second --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- and I got a check, so that was nice.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I was like, "I wonder if this thing is really --"
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  "-- you know, on the --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- up and up". [SIGH] Even though, I mean, ten minutes isn't going to kill me. [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah, right. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Well, um, yeah, that's cool.  Yeah, yeah --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I wonder, um, what they're figuring out from the survey, the --
L:  [NOISE] Oh, maybe he's writing a book or something --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I don't know.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Whatever it is, they get to listen to us talking about it, huh?
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] 
R:  That's neat.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  Well, um [SIGH] -- well, let's see --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- what else is there about books in school?
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] 
R:  Um, [NOISE] as long as they don't ban, you know -- [SIGH] the [MN] -- the whole banning book is not a good thing either.
L:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] Yeah --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I [SIGH] -- but, you know, there's -- just takes one --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- very, very influential person to, you know, kind of ruin things for --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- [NOISE] just -- about anything.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, that's true. [NOISE] Like --
L:  And it's --
R:  -- George Bush for instance. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  It's just really --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- it's just really sad.
R:  Yeah.  On the brighter side [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, I -- [LIPSMACK] I'm -- and the -- the only --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- reason I came out is 'cause [SIGH] my mom had taped the last episode of Angel --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I was like, "Oh, my gosh, you know, this is the last one".  And I love that show.
R:  I don't -- I don't think I've ever seen it.
L:  Touched by an Angel.
