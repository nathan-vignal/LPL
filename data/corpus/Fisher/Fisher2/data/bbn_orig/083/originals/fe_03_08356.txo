L:  [LIPSMACK] Hi.
R:  Oh, hi, um, this is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Shahab here.
L:  I'm Deborah [NOISE].  What's your name?
R:  Shahab.
L:  Shahab?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Hi.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Where do you live?
R:  Yeah, I live in Louisiana.  What about you?
L:  I live in Hawaii.
R:  Oh, Hawaii.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Nice place.
L:  And --
R:  So --
L:  -- um, so I think we're supposed to talk about -- [NOISE] at least I think I understood, or is [NOISE] it, um, whether --
R:  Yeah, we have to talk about fitness.
L:  -- we exercise daily.
R:  Yeah, fitness.  So, how old are you?
L:  [NOISE] Um, I'm -- I'm not sure.  I compete in the fifty to fifty five age category.
R:  Okay.
L:  I'm in there somewhere. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I'm young, like I'm twenty four, so ...
L:  [NOISE] So --
R:  So --
L:  -- do you -- [NOISE] do you do any sports?
R:  Yah, normally I play, uh, tennis and, uh, sometimes I play cricket.  You know cricket?  Some --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- game this year.
L:  Oh, cricket?
R:  Yeah, cricket.
L:  [NOISE] Uh, where --
R:  I'm like --
L:  -- are you from? [NOISE]
R:  Uh, I'm from --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- India, so ...
L:  Oh.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Oh, [NOISE] yeah, I --
R:  Like I am doing is my masters --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- degree, so ...
L:  Yeah, I'm a history major [NOISE] and India was one of my specialties I learned --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- about Kali [NOISE] Dasa and, uh --
R:  That sounds great.
L:  Hindustani music.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Anyway, so --
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- uh, like what do you do for your health?  Like what -- how do --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you do that?
L:  For sports, I --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- do, um -- I do triathlons --
R:  Hm, great.
L:  -- and I do -- I run and I bike and I swim and sometimes I play volleyball.
R:  So, you must be very fit?
L:  Um, well, I -- I think I am.  I'm [NOISE] --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- I'm faster now at everything than I was when I was twenty.
R:  Hm, uh-huh.
L:  So, um --
R:  Now, like how's your weight?  Like is it [MN] a weight and BP?  Because in your age, maybe that does involves a problem.
L:  No, actually, no, I'm -- I'm healthier and stronger now.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, but then I don't believe age is real and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- neither did Einstein.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Einstein said that, um, age -- time was an illusion.  Uh, a tenacious illusion but an illusion --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and I think that, uh, t- -- you know, since time is made up --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- then age is, um -- is a huge colossal joke and that you know, we can be -- we can demonstrate as much fitness as we want to demonstrate --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, as long as we, um, [LIPSMACK] don't buy into time.  That's one of the reasons I [NOISE] couldn't tell you exactly how old I was, because I don't --
R:  Yeah, that's [several inaudible words].
L:  -- think about it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] Because it, I --
R:  So, how do you find --
L:  -- I --
R:  -- jogging, like -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  How do you find jogging?  Do you go jogging?
L:  Pardon?
R:  Uh, how do you find jogging, walk- --
L:  Jogging?
R:  Yeah.  You do --
L:  I love --
R:  -- uh --
L:  -- it.
R:  You love it?
L:  It -- it's, um [NOISE] -- I find it relaxing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, I -- I get into a really nice rhythm when I jog --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, I find myself, when I'm running, I start off with, you know -- you know, I'm so glad to be alive and then I go from there to [NOISE] being grateful for the wind and [NOISE] grateful for the sun and grateful for -- so, I get into this really nice, um --
R:  Yeah, but isn't it like very monotonous, it's like you're walking alone, because sometimes I feel it's very monotonous, you know, walking all -- all -- all alone.  Means, when you play or something, like when I play tennis, I feel like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- more interactive, somebody's playing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- with you and you've got more --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and [inaudible] --
L:  Oh, that -- that's definitely -- there's definitely a difference.  That's one of the reasons why I enter, um [NOISE] -- love, uh, triathlons and stuff because I [NOISE] like to do this with other people.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So -- but I train -- I usually train alone [NOISE] and then I, [NOISE] um -- I practice, although I teach at a -- at a school here in Hawaii [NOISE] and [NOISE] last year --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I played, um -- I participated with the cross country team [NOISE] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I thought [NOISE] these kids [NOISE] were gonna leave me in the dust and that's not --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- what happened. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] At the beginning of the season, they were trying [NOISE] to catch me, which was so nice and by -- by the end of the season, I told those guys, I said, "If you want to win, you've got to leave me far behind" and so, they used me as a [NOISE] -- a rabbit to chase.
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  Um, and by the end of the year, we had one girl that was first in the State [NOISE] and [NOISE], uh, another boy that did really well because they used me as a rabbit, so ...
R:  Yah, that's -- yeah, that's great.  Like, uh, do you know something, like how --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- do you keep, uh, your belly -- like stomach, flat, because that is like [LIPSMACK] -- I have like this problem, you know, um, like I know I'm not overweight but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I have kind of this problem --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that it's kind of plumpy, you know.
L:  [NOISE] Um --
R:  Do you have some special --
L:  -- well --
R:  -- exercise --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- for that?
L:  The way -- the way I use, um -- what I do for all fitness --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [NOISE] is I translate things into thoughts and then I control the thought.  So, like what -- what does your stomach -- the muscles in your stomach represent to you?  What is it and so, [LIPSMACK] that's what I figure out.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That muscle -- I also know that muscles aren't self [NOISE] acting --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that we govern our muscles.  They don't operate [NOISE] unconsciously without us. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  And [NOISE] so, um, [NOISE] I have to come at it from that point, because if I'm coming at it strictly from muscle --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] um, that's not only non [NOISE] inspiring -- I don't think it's very effective --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, I think that like -- I shared with the other people I spoke to, that [NOISE] I believe we, [NOISE] um, get -- we don't get fit, that we demonstrate fitness.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  [NOISE] And [NOISE] getting fit implies that it evaporates and that if we don't do it on a regular basis, we're out of luck.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Whereas demonstrating fitness means that [NOISE] just getting out of bed and walking into [NOISE] the kitchen is, uh, some degree of fitness [NOISE] that we already have and [NOISE] that --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- [NOISE] we're demonstrating [NOISE] for motives that are, um, you know, better than muscle [NOISE].  Like in the Bible, um, I think Paul wrote, "Bodily exercise profits a little".
R:  Mhm.
L:  And for a long time I thought it was saying, "Don't exercise".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But he didn't say, "Exercise profits a little".  He said, "Bodily exercise profits a little" and to me, I think he's talking about motive.
R:  Mhm.
L:  If our motive is just muscle --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, we're gonna be out of luck.  But if our motive [NOISE] is to demonstrate [NOISE] [SIGH] grace --
R:  Sounds a bit like, uh --
L:  -- and endurance and power --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- and --
R:  Yah, but, uh -- uh, like how do like know you must do something, you know, physical work or as well other than apart from motives, you need to do something physically also --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to get --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, [several inaudible words] --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, you -- you have to think, um, I'm gonna eat dinner before you make it.  So, you've got to think about what you're gonna do before you do it.  And what I'm talking about is, your reason for doing something can't just be -- for me it can't be -- it can't just be muscle.  It's --
R:  No, it's --
L:  -- the -- my motive --
R:  -- sounds a lot --
L:  -- has got to be --
R:  -- more --
L:  -- to demonstrate joy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's got to be to demonstrate fitness --
R:  Yeah, but it's --
L:  -- and it's t- --
R:  -- also like a good feeling, like you have got a good body, it's always a good thing and that is why even like I go --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to play, or even sometimes, like, you know, I like doing things because it's always, you know, a good body is always an asset and you feel good about yourself if you have got a good body.  You don't feel really good when you gotta, you know, very fat kind of thing.  So --
L:  Um --
R:  -- um --
L:  -- I heard you say that having a good body makes you feel good.
R:  Yah, that's --
L:  And that, um, having a good body is a good thing.
R:  Yeah, obviously.  It's like feeling so --
L:  Uh, I agree.  I agree but [LIPSMACK], um, I -- I also believe that if our motives includes thoughts that are bigger than, uh, just us --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- that we [SIGH] tap into, um, [LIPSMACK] a universal power that ab- -- that helps everybody.
R:  Mm.
L:  And that if we're -- if we're dealing with the subject matter that says small as just one person --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we don't get -- we don't tap into this universal power and so, that's why -- that's one of the reasons why I -- I check my motives and I make my motive be as spiritual as possible --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- before I do something.  And I tell ya, it took me a long time to get a spiritual thought about doing any kind of stomach exercises. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, uh, [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [LAUGH] but I finally [LAUGH] -- [NOISE] I finally found some fun ways [NOISE] to do it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like I -- I swim too and --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- um, one of the things I do in the pool, is I stretch out in a streamline position --
R: Mm.
L:  -- and then I rotate in a circle --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- so that I'm going from my back to my stomach without using my arms and without using my legs.  I use my whole body to turn.  And you do this about thirty times and boy, you can feel that in your stomach.  So, it's kind of like an inchworm in the water --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- flipping around from side to side in a circle --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and [NOISE] front to back, front to back con- constantly and so, that's what I do that's fun.  'Cause I don't think crunches are fun. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, crunches are a little bit bored --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and stuff.
L:  Oh, I heard about this one singer that did a thousand a day.
R:  Oh, man.
L:  And I figure, well, if he can do a thousand a day, I can do a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- hundred, yeah?  So --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  One thousand's like too much --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- a thousand ...
L:  What kind of work do you do?
R:  Yeah, I'm a student, a masters student --
L:  You're a --
R:  -- so like ...
L:  -- what?
R:  Yah, I'm a graduate student.
L:  Oh, what's your major?
R:  Yeah, my major is industrial engineering.
L:  Industry and ...?
R:  No, en- engineering.  Industrial engineering.
L:  Oh, Indian?
R:  No, industrial engineering, that's a -- engine --
L:  Industrial --
R:  Engineering, yeah.
L:  Engineering.
R:  Yah, engineering.
L:  Oh, good for you.
R:  Yah. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yah.
L:  Yeah, I did my masters in, um, education and history.
R:  Okay.  Where from?  Like where did you do your masters?
L:  [NOISE] Uh, in --
