L:  [COUGH] 
R:  Yeah, hi, my name is Tina.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Uh, hi, I'm Betty from --
R:  Hi.
L:  -- Ohio.
R:  Hi, Betty, I'm from, uh, New York City.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, ho.
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Um, [SIGH] so you're -- you sound young, you probably --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- do exercise.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I do pretty much every day, I try to --
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- unless, uh, [NOISE] working too hard [NOISE] and -- or too hectic and I can't get away, but I think it's [SIGH] really, really very important.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, I think it is too --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- but it seems like I don't take enough time to, you know, do regular exercises. [SIGH] I'm thinking I get enough exercise by [SIGH] working in my garden --
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  -- which is really big. [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  So, I bend and stoop and all that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] but I know --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- I would probably be better off if I [LIPSMACK] had a regular time to exercise.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, but your exercise is probably pretty good I imagine, [NOISE] if you have a garden, you know. [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] Well, I do that and then I --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, I have the yard --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with a lot of flowers.
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE] 
L:  But still I proba- you know, I -- I think I would probably get rid of my belly [LAUGH] if I --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- did regular exercises.
R:  [NOISE] M- maybe some power walking or --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- with friends sometimes, you know --
L:  Well --
R:  -- makes it fun.
L:  [SIGH] We live sort of out in the coun- we live out in the country, but yet it's close to st- [MN] to the stores and everything.
R:  [SIGH] Uh-huh. [NOISE] 
L:  It used to be a farm.
R:  [NOISE] Really?
L:  And, um, we have two and a half acres.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And my garden is really big [SIGH] but --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, [SIGH] I'm seventy two --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and I should be exercising [LIPSMACK] or do weight lifting.  They say that weight lifting is --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- good for --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- older people. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, is that what they say? [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  Definitely say it's good younger people but don't strain yourself or anything.
L:  Mm.
R:  [MN] 
L:  Well, I [MN] -- I don't know, I -- I just can't get motivated to, [SIGH] you know, join a regular --
R:  [NOISE] Gym.
L:  -- join -- yeah, join a gym or [SIGH] do regular exercising.  I can always find something else I need --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- to do. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] To avoid it.  My parents are actually amazingly good about the gym.  They're there, like, every day, they don't even care if the other one's there or not, they just stick to their own thing [NOISE] --
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  -- kind of, um, and [SIGH] -- yeah, they've doing it for years, so now I'm so -- [SIGH] like, they'll get off the phone to me to go and -- go -- go to the gym, and I'm like, "What?" [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] 'Cause I've probably called, and they're like, "Oh, whatever, we got to go to the gym".  I'm like --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- "Okay, [SIGH] you guys go do that".  I think it's kind of funny, but, [NOISE] uh, it's kind of the way I am too now, [NOISE] I'm like, "Well, I go to go do that, sorry". [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like [SIGH] --
L:  Are your parents real fit?
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] They are actually, they're pretty fit.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [COUGH] Just healthy, nothing like, uh, you know, [NOISE] [SIGH] not very toned, but, you know, my mum, like, likes her sweets, so I guess that's the way she feels like she can [SIGH] eat 'em. [NOISE] 
L:  [LAUGH] I like sweets --
R:  You know.
L:  -- too.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
L:  I'd say -- well, [SIGH] I'm not very heavy, so I w- I think, "Well, maybe I really don't need to exercise [LAUGH] that much". [LAUGH] [SIGH] But that's --
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, but, you know, your heart, it'll keep --
L:  I know.
R:  -- your heart in good shape and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- lots of other things. [SIGH] If you don't -- I see a lot of people who get sick 'cause they just don't -- [SIGH] plus it helps your immune system.  The other thing is it -- the endorphins.  I truly believe that if, like, a couple of days go by and I don't work out and a bunch of my friends who are the same way, that all of a sudden you just feel kind of crappy.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yuck about life.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] Well, uh --
R:  [NOISE] So, I think there's a lot of truth to the whole [SIGH] endorphins. [NOISE] 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Which, uh --
L:  [SIGH] It seems like -- uh, you know, I -- I'm in good healthy condition, [SIGH] I  -- well, I have low cholesterol, low bro- low blood pressure, not too low --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but low --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  -- and I don't have any heart problems.
R:  Mhm.  Oh, that's good. [SIGH] 
L:  But [LIPSMACK] I'd probably still feel better maybe. 
R:  Maybe.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Maybe I would. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] No, you sound pretty healthy right now, though. [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] That's good.
R:  [LIPSMACK] How old are you?
L:  Uh, I'm twenty seven.
R:  Oh, you're a mere child.
L:  A mere child --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- mum -- mum says, she's like, "You need to get married". [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] If only I couldn't go home for the weekend anymore 'cause it's driving me insane. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, you're a --
R:  That's a mother's job.
L:  -- you're all talk[?]. [NOISE] Is it?  Because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- trying to think that she's just gone mad.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, like, yesterday my dad and I were talking, and I was like, "You know I can't come home, and you know why".  And he was like, "Yeah, [NOISE] I know --"
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  "-- I have to hear about it all the time and --"
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  "-- about how you're not married".  And he was like, "What is she -- what is wrong with her, is she obsessed?"  I was like, "Yeah". [MN] 
R:  Do you have any brothers or sisters who are married?
L:  Uh, yeah, uh, no, no one's married.
R:  Oh, so she wants that grandchild.
L:  [SIGH] I mean, god, go get some hobbies or something for god's sake.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, it's not like --
R:  [MN] It's up to you to get her a grandchild. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] It's not -- it's not all that it's about, it's, uh --
R:  [SIGH] OH, no. [SIGH] Well, we had a daughter that just got married [SIGH] in No- this last November and she was --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- forty four.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] I have a daughter who is --
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- forty nine.  She has one child, [SIGH] a boy --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and then the -- w- we have a son who has two little girls. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  But I was sixty before I ever got to be a grandmother, so tell your --
L:  Oh. [SIGH] 
R:  -- mother just --
L:  Acc-
R:  -- cool it. [LAUGH] 
L:  And don't hold her breath. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] I don't know, there's a lot [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] -- a lot to think about getting married these days.
R:  [SIGH] Uh, yeah, she doesn't get that.  Like, they're -- we're Indian, right, and so -- I was born and raised here, so [SIGH] yeah, I don't get her thing, but her thing was my dad, you know, who, by the way [SIGH] he was twenty nine, he studied here, he [SIGH] went back for three days, checked out twenty chicks each day and picked her, [COUGH] who wasn't even supposed to get married.  She, like -- [SIGH] they wanted, like, her older sister to be seen and --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- she basically came out, like, [SIGH] you know, to serve tea and my dad was like -- huh, and I guess she was the hottest one, you know --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- something like that.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Now -- and that's basically how they quote unquote decided, you know, and I'm like --
L:  Really?
R:  -- "It doesn't work that way, mum.  Like, you don't go through a factory and pick [SIGH] the cutest chick" you know.
L:  [SIGH] No. [SIGH] no, and --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- it -- it's so hard anymore, I mean, to know whether [SIGH] -- I -- our -- our daughter, you know, forty four, she had never been married. [COUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  She was quite independent, she had a good job, [SIGH] she had her own home she paid for and [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- she said, "Until I meet somebody that I want to live with for the rest of my life, I'm not getting married".
R:  And you know what?  That's a long time.
L:  [LIPSMACK] It is. [SIGH] We've been married fifty years, and fifty years is a long time.
R:  And when did you get married?
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  How old were you?
L:  I was --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- twenty two.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, so you were a young 'un.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] But, um --
L:  [SIGH] Well, in my time --
R:  [inaudible] --
L:  -- in my time, twenty two was old to get married.
R:  [NOISE] See --
L:  I mean, p- [SIGH] kids were getting married at fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, which is way too young.
R:  [SIGH] I mean, I have to admit, what worries me is I know guys [NOISE] my age and I know a lot of guys older than me, and the interesting thing these men do [SIGH] is they start looking way younger.  Like, guys who are, like, they -- who are, like, thirty one, thirty two, are looking at twenty five year olds like they're cute [NOISE] [SIGH] and interested in that age.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, this -- it's -- it's really -- it's so -- it's crappy the way young girls get screwed, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  For one, like, you have to have kids by a certain age, really --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you have to, it's biological [SIGH] and then the second thing is these guys, like, they can pick younger and younger --
L:  yeah.
R:  -- and it's cool to with, like, an older guy, or it's kind of a turn on of sorts, you know.
L:  Yeah, [SIGH] and --
R:  [NOISE] But, um [SIGH] --
L:  -- it's kinda crazy --
R:  I don't [NOISE] --
L:  -- to, the -- uh, there's a double standard [SIGH] [MN] --
R:  total double standard.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  so, we're like -- well, it's like, well, w- what are -- oh, my god, I mean, right now, twenty seven, fine, but [SIGH] as soon as I hit, like, thirty, like, these guys start going to twenty five year olds, you know.
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] 
R:  And it makes them feel younger and better and --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- [MN] [SIGH] and then they don't want to [SIGH] date someone who's going to want to have kids, like, nine months after the marriage because they're running out of time and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- try and anticipate their [NOISE] -- some problems, but, you know, I hope [SIGH] I don't know, that there's some guy out there who's not a jackass and, like, all --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the others that I date.  I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] But just don't be in t-
R:  So, there's hope, but you never know.
L:  Just don't be in too big a hurry.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Our daughter waited --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- all that time and [SIGH] -- God has somebody out there just for you.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  He's made someone just for you. [LAUGH] 
R:  That's -- [SIGH] it's what I hear.  I'm like, "Will I ever find him, though?"
L:  [MN] I kept telling our daughter --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] "Prince Charming is on his way, but I think [NOISE] his horse threw a shoe or something". [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Or maybe he got lame or something, but he's on his way. [LAUGH] 
R:  See, that's very comforting and nice.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] You don't need, like, your mum, like, hovering over you telling you you're, like, completely [SIGH] [NOISE] you know, going to never --
L:  I t-
R:  -- get married and --
L:  No, no.
R:  -- stuff like that and she cries herself to sleep every day.  It's like, "Come on, now".
L:  No, [SIGH] and the thing is --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] uh, these --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- guys [NOISE] you know, they want to go out and they want to have sex with every woman they can have.
R:  Oh, yeah, oh, y-
L:  But then, when they finally decide they want to settle down and get married, they want a virgin.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, which is so ridiculous, I'm sorry --
L:  [NOISE] Isn't that stupid?
R:  -- in this day and age.  It's so ridic- [NOISE] it's like --
L:  It is.
R:  -- it's like, "You've just done what with how many chicks?  Now -- now you want to --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  And that's part of the reason I think they might like younger, because they're like, "Ooh", you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Probably less --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- quote unquote, dirty, but, like, what is the -- [SIGH] I just really -- it really makes me angry. [SIGH]  [NOISE] 
L:  It -- it does me, too.
R:  makes me so angry.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] It's just nonsense.
L:  It's just not good.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] Okay, we'd better get back --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- to our subject. [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] Sorry, yeah, you're right. [NOISE] 
L:  But it's more fun to talk about other --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- things. [LAUGH] 
R:  I know, we shouldn't talk about marriage.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Um, but, yeah, health, I guess, you know, I work on the treadmill pretty much and I lift weights, that's all I do --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I try to go every --
