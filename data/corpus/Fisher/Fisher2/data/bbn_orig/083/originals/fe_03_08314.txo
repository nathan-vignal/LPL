R:  Hello, I'm Rachael.
L:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] Hi, I'm Marcella.
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  [SIGH] Just fine.
R:  [SIGH] [NOISE] So, do you exercise on a regular basis?
L:  [SIGH] Um, I'm in a -- a wheelchair, but I do a lot of upper body [SIGH] exercises --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- with dumbbells and, uh, that's the way I start my morning --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- and I have to do this in order [SIGH] to be able to maintain enough strength to stand to get in the shower and, uh --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- you know, to transfer from my chair to the bed.
R:  Do you follow any videos?
L:  [SIGH] Uh, yes, I -- my daughter's getting me the Greer, [SIGH] um, bod- body flex, the breathing exercise. [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] I have a -- a small one, but, uh, she's getting me the larger one --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- [SIGH] and I do that eight minutes in the morning, with the dumbbells --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- uh, procedures, [LIPSMACK] and I have the body --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- flex by, uh, Jake, where --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- you sit down and -- and it keeps the strength in your back and --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- [SIGH] and you can use it on your legs, except my knees don't bend --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [LAUGH] so I can't use that. [SIGH] I need knee replacement surgery and I'm too much of a coward to go have it done.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh. [LAUGH] 
L:  So 
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, I used to exercise on a regular basis.  I used to belong to a gym and I really liked doing that, but then my husband and I bought a house and moved away, [SIGH] so at that point we stopped exercising. [SIGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I do have -- I did buy a treadmill one Christmas time and I used it faithfully for a couple of months [SIGH] but since then it's been slowing down, [LAUGH] as I get busy.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, I know.  I got the [SIGH] ab doer --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it's great, but when your knees don't work it's kinda hard to transfer from one seat to the other --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- and, [SIGH] um, anyway [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I got [MN] the Jo Weedner[?] stuff with the pull cords.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And that's great, it stays folded up in [LAUGH] -- in the garage.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] And [SIGH] then the Body by Jake, it's nice and heavy and sturdy and I use that to stand up on to g- [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- sort of to get on the bed.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] And, um, [SIGH] anyway, but I've got all this stuff and I should use, and I'm hoping as soon as I get my knees don't that, you know, just normal activities --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- uh, 'cause I've raised my grandsons since --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they were born and [SIGH] -- and they're nine and seven now.
R:  They probably you with exercise. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Well, uh, you'd be surprised.  I scoot around in the chair, the doctor tried --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- to tell me that my muscles in my legs were atrophied, [SIGH] but you feel my calf muscles --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- and hell, they're -- [SIGH] they're firmer than they were when I was sixteen and doing --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- gymnastics. [LAUGH] So, I know the muscles in [SIGH] -- my leg between my knee and, you know, my thigh, [SIGH] those are -- are loose and I really need to work on those but, [SIGH] if I bend my kn- you know, if I do leg lifts, uh, sometimes where the bone is fuse, it, um, it might break a little bit, [SIGH] and then the pain is pretty pain for two, three days until --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it heals.  So, I have to be a little careful doing too many leg exercises.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh, I'm extremely healthy for [SIGH] my condition, [SIGH] which I think is great. [MN] and, uh -- what else are we supposed to talk about.
R:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] 
L:  Diet and fitness --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- or ?
R:  Yeah, I think fitness in general.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  Um, so you enjoy lifting weights, right?
L:  Um, I don't enjoy it, but --
R:  You don't?
L:  -- uh, [SIGH] [LAUGH] it's something that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I know I need to do --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] so that I can pick up, [COUGH] you know, the kids or [SIGH] -- or --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- just pull myself up.  Really that's -- that's the biggest thing is getting in and out of the shower [SIGH] and, you know, maintaining my strength for that.
R:  Mhm, that was always my favorite part of going to the gym [SIGH] 'cause you can actually see your muscles growing, [NOISE] especially my arm muscles.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] It would only take a few weeks and I would be able to tell the difference right away.
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] So, I [SIGH] should do it a little more [NOISE] and -- 'cause I've always -- you know, I've had the gym too, when it first got popular way back when, [SIGH] uh, enjoyed, but it's just going, and here I've got all this stuff -- equipment at home, it's just using it.
R:  Right, [SIGH] I totally understand that. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] But no, the kids have, you know, the bicycles and the skates and the skate board and so I've always [SIGH] had -- even my children, you know, I made sure that they were physically active [SIGH] and that they did things rather than, you know, just sit in front of the television.
R:  Right.
L:  And with the grandchildren it's the same, we have our outside time [NOISE] and, in fact, uh, before the computer started, you know, we were outside most of the day and we've got a shaded patio and they have a swing set and -- [SIGH] and like I said, the skates and stuff to do. [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] [MN] They're limited as to the --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- amount of time [NOISE] they can spend, [NOISE] you know, watching a video or -- or on the computer. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.  I don't have children yet, but I want to -- [SIGH] I want to personally be fit and active for when I do have children and have a -- set a good example for them.
L:  That's great, my --
R:  Because my --
L:  -- daughter's taking [SIGH] her son, um, swimming in a little bit, and she's not due until [SIGH] the end of the month. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, we get so tickled, they're taking Dominic swimming.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] So, he's getting his exercise and he's not even here yet.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But she's always been -- she was a gymnast and then she was a cheerleader and [SIGH] -- and the only bad thing, she's only thirty two, and she bends down and you'd think it was an old grandma [SIGH] --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- because her knees pop. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mine pop every time I bend too.
L:  Ew.  My son had to have arthroscopic surgery 'cause his job required him, [NOISE] you know, standing and bending a lot and he got a little heavy for a while, but that doesn't seem to bother him any more, so maybe [LIPSMACK] that might just be what she has to have one day, but --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- we eat a -- a very healthy diet, both my husband and I [SIGH] and we've got the thirty two ounce bottles of water [LAUGH] on the table now.  They don't look too pretty --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and we try to empty each one, [NOISE] you know, twice a day.
R:  [SIGH] That's great.
L:  Or more.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And with, uh, staying hydrated and [SIGH] -- and cool, in Texas it's [LAUGH] kind of hard [SIGH] but --
R:  [NOISE] That would be true.  I'm in Pennsylvania [SIGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it's definitely cooler here than in Texas, I'm sure.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But I, too, I keep a -- I keep a container of water on my desk at work at all times --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I force myself to drink it.
L:  [SIGH] Well, it's good for so many things, and it keeps you from having so many things.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  But, uh, the water, and we've gone to [SIGH] no fat, and since I'm sixty two, all of a sudden I've found out that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I can't eat salt.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And my doctor tried to tell me that it was because I'm in a wheelchair and the -- [SIGH] the heart doesn't pump the blood back up like it used to, [SIGH] but I think he's wrong --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- because we had a B.L.T., the next morning [SIGH] my feet were puffy and so I have cut out [SIGH] as much salt as possible, you know, there's so much stuff that -- that has it --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- already in the can.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, uh, as long as I stay away from it, I don't have that problem, so [NOISE] I think my doctor is mistaken. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] But, um, a lot of salads, a lot of vegetables, a little bit of fruit cause I'm diabetic --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and I [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] can't handle too much sweet.  And [SIGH] there, I don't know what else we can talk about, other than [SIGH] the weight bands, that's what I'm looking forward to getting, that you can put under you feet and pull.
R:  Yes.
L:  I've used those --
R:  the resistance.
L:  -- in classes.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  I've done, uh, like, aerobic classes where they've used those. [NOISE] 
R:  Did you have good results with them?
L:  Um, [SIGH] I personally didn't like them --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but some people -- I mean, some people use them for a lot of different things.
R:  [SIGH] Well, that Greer Childers --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- has the aerobic breathing exercises --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and she says they're fantastic for people who are on a chair [NOISE] or even bedridden, [SIGH] and she's got this new band that sh- that you pull and you just turn and it gives five pounds resistance for each turn, [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] and I'm looking forward --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- to getting that and trying it. [SIGH] And maybe I'll be [LAUGH] better at using it than I am --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- the other, but I do do -- even the Martha Stewart has a lot of the -- the dumbbell exercises.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  The repetitions of fourteen [SIGH] and you just go from one to the other. [SIGH] And they're -- they're easy to do, my weights are [SIGH] a little bit heavier than I think I need to start with, but I had 'em.  They're five pounds apiece, but, um, it's a lot easy than picking up a fifty pound grandkid [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- [inaudible].  But, um, [MN] --
L:  I've always wanted to get that Tony Little gazelle.  Have you seen advertisements for that?
R:  Yes, I would love to have it if my knees worked.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  We got the Tony Little, [SIGH] um -- oh, the stepper and -- when my daughter was living here, and [SIGH] she's got all his videos and I've --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- got a few of them [SIGH] and he had one where he worked out with, you know, the dumbbells, but I can't find it.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
R:  But --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I recently got this book called Eight Minutes in the Morning, [SIGH] uh, using, you know, dumbbells and I've been working [SIGH] on that and you -- you work --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- two exercises each day, [SIGH] oh --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- about five repetitions on each one of fourteen sets, or fourteen repetitions of the five sets, something like that, [SIGH] and they're very simple and it just takes eight minutes.  I haven't -- [SIGH] this is the first week so I don't know if I've had a-
