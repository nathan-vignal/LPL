L:  Larry.
R:  Hi, Larry.  My name's Noelle.
L:  Hi, Noelle.  How're you doing?
R:  I'm doing great, thanks.  How about yourself?
L:  Oh, pretty good.
R:  Yeah, where do you live?
L:  Uh, Earlington, Texas.
R:  Oh, wow.  I just moved from Plano.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yep, and I'm up in Chicago now.
L:  Oh, how is it?
R:  It's, um, hot and I'm actually without electricity.
L:  Oh.
R:  Well, I have been for the last four days but I -- it just went on about a couple of hours ago.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I feel like I'm in Texas, you know, 'cause it's so hot.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  But, um, yeah, I'm -- I'm, uh I loved it down there.
L:  So why did you leave?
R:  Dallas is a great place to live.  Uh, I got divorced actually --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- so, I moved back up north --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- to my -- to live closer to my family [MN] so yeah, it's been a good move for me.
L:  Well, good.
R:  So, I guess what do we need to talk about tonight?
L:  Well, our topic of the day is censorship.
R:  Okay.
L:  About both public and private schools controlling what, uh, they let their students read.
R:  Mhm.  Do you have kids?
L:  No, not even married.
R:  Mhm, so you don't have any kids in school then.  That's what I was --
L:  No.
R:  -- leading -- I have two kids.  I've got a two and four year old.  Two little boys --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- and, um, I send my son to a private school.  A, uh, Christian school --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I would think that they probably do censor what the kids read and --
L:  I would think with a private school that they both do and are perfectly able to do what they want.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Pr- public school -- I meant private schools.  Public schools I guess I'm a little less on board with that.  Just -- and -- and it's because I think some of the ones that the public schools have had to pull off their shelves because somebody complained were just stupid [LAUGH].
R:  Like what?
L:  Tom Sawyer.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  You know, 'cause it was written over a hundred years ago and has the word nigger in it.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, there's no reason to yank it off the shelves.  It's a perfect opportunity to explain, you know, both the -- the time period and why that's not acceptable now instead of --
R:  Right.  I would have to agree with you on that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  However, I wouldn't really want my kids reading -- well, I'm just -- I -- I -- I don't know necessarily what books that my school has banned --
L:  yeah.
R:  -- but probably they ban the Harry Potter books --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- which I haven't read myself but, um --
L:  I have.
R:  Really? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And what did -- what did you think of them?
L:  I thought they were fantastic stories.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is there much in there about, um, demons and witchcraft?
L:  Not demons.
R:  Uh-huh, but witchcraft.
L:  Uh, they talk about witchcraft and wizardry in -- in the sense of, you know, you're going to school and the school teaches you how to -- one class teaches you potions, one class teaches this type of spell casting, things like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It doesn't get terribly involved in how to do it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's just pieces of the -- of the story the -- the environment.  I find it interesting that a lot of groups, particularly religious groups, well particularly Christian groups have complained about Harry Potter, you know being this pagan, satanic, you know, tutorial --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- yet in the story they celebrate Christmas and Easter and, you know, all the normal holidays which --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, are -- not all of them but most of them are Christian based holidays.
R:  Right.  Like well I don't think I'd want my kids reading that just because I -- I wouldn't really want to expose them.  I -- I am very down on witchcraft and spell casting and all that kind of thing --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- so I wouldn't want to put it in their hands and let their minds kind of wander.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, in that case, I would probably be pro, um, the schools limiting what -- what books the kids get to read.
L:  Well, yeah, and if you're sending them to a Christian school, you know, I -- I would be willing to let the school make decisions on what they want to make available and something like that is, you know, w- whether you see it as bad or not is just an extra thing they have to defend or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or challenge and well, they get older maybe that becomes an appropriate thing but, you know, when they're very young, no, you know, there's -- there's no point --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in even getting into that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- at that level.
R:  Actually --
L:  I've got a -- I've got a friend of mine that's got a -- both a teenager and a -- a young boy.  He's about to turn six and her teenage girl is very much into those books.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, and she loves -- this friend of mine loved Harry Potter just simply for the fact --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that it was a book her girl got interested in and started reading.
R:  Just so that she'd read.
L:  Just so that she -- she got used to picking up a book and reading 'cause, you know, she -- she has novels all over the house about, you know, a variety of different things by a variety of different authors --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and she couldn't get her interested in reading but she sees Mom doing it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and so if this is what got it started then she's all for it [LAUGH] you know.
R:  Mhm.  Well, I guess it's -- I -- I mean I guess I can kinda see that if your kid doesn't have any sort of appreciation for books --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- then maybe you would be grateful for any book they'd pick up --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, um, I don't know --
L:  Especially if they don't --
R:  -- I guess I wouldn't --
L:  -- especially I -- I think since it's fiction, if they don't take it as being, you know, real -- this is real things.  This is what really happens.  You know, you kinda get 'em close to the age where they can start differentiating fantasy from, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- from -- from real life, then it just becomes a story is all, so ...
R:  Yeah, I don't -- I -- I would wonder how many kids have dabbled in witchcraft or even looked it up online or gotten interested in it or searched out any more information about it as a result of the Harry Potter books.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  I don't know.
L:  Myself I would wonder how many of them got that way just because of the -- the point being made about it.  Whether, you know, if -- if our -- of course you know --
R:  By condemning it?
L:  Well, I mean, --
R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  -- because of all the publicity about that aspect around those books.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, say -- it would be planting the idea rather than just reading, you know.  It's hard for me to take a thirty -- thirty eight year old brain and put it back in a ten year old body [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, and read that and say, well I can figure out that this is just pure fantasy versus, you know, wow I bet this really happens.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, I -- but I'd like to think that that wouldn't have been a big trick [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know.  It's an interesting --
L:  It suppose that it's, uh --
R:  It's an interesting topic.
L:  -- it's, uh, passionate subject for me because I remember going through the same thing when I was about that age with dungeons and dragons.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, that was a --
R:  And did you play?
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I still do as a matter of fact.
R:  Oh, do you?
L:  Just not near -- well, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- nothing -- I mean, my friends and I all have different things to do now so we don't -- you know, the group of friends I have now.  Sometimes we get together and play something like it, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's not an every weekend thing like it used to be or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- stuff like that.
R:  Do you go to the conferences?
L:  Not any more.
R:  The -- the gaming conferences?
L:  No.
R:  I have a friend that -- that gamed for a long time and so I'm --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- familiar with the GenCon and the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- different --
L:  One time we made --
R:  -- ones in this area.
L:  Yeah, one time we made the trek up to Wisconsin for -- for GenCon --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, uh, just once.  We used to have DallasCon around here until it went bust.
R:  Oh.  It's still really hot up here.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm amazed.  I -- I didn't even know that it all existed still.  I remember dungeons and dragons.  I'm thirty two.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  and So I remember dungeons and dragons from when I was in high school and -- and how the church just totally made a big deal out of it and --
L:  Yeah, we had city council -- one particular person --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I still remember on the city council it was his crusade --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- because he discovered that there was a group of kids that got their name on the list to -- of one of the public parks and the recreation center --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they were basically, you know, getting this big room and saying, "Hey, we got this big room.  Come down and play" --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and that's what they were playing and he would just got all bent out of shape about it.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, I -- I also am not real crazy about -- about that and even I went and observed a game and I don't know, I think it'd be very easy for kids to kind of take it too far and get -- have it become more real than fantasy and --
L:  Yeah, I -- I have a problem seeing really young kids playing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- bec- because of that 'cause I don't think they can make the distinction very easily.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, and I think it also depends a lot on who you're playing with.
R:  Right, and how seriously they take it and how --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- much they bring in the evil.
L:  Yeah, yeah because I remember -- you know, I -- I got -- the more I played the pickier I got about who I played with.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah, that's how he was too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, yeah, it's a -- it's an interesting hobby.
L:  Yeah, and I -- I tend to -- I don't know, I tend to equate the two, you know, the hand wringing and stuff like that over Harry Potter, you know.  They've just replaced where it said D and D and put Harry Potter in its place for most of it.
R:  That -- that does seem true, yes.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That does seem true and since you didn't want --
L:  Well, let me ask you --
R:  -- censorship --
L:  -- at -- at four -- I -- I presume it's your four year old you're sending to this Christian --
R:  Yeah, uh-huh.
L:  -- school.
R:  Pre school, mhm.
L:  Okay.  Uh, I wondered how -- what -- what did -- do they actively try to like teach him how to read and write or is it pretty much, uh ...
