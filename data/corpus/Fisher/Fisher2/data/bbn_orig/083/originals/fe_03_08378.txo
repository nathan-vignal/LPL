R:  [SIGH]  HI, I'm Kathleen.
L:  Hi, I'm Cindy.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  How are you today?
R:  [SIGH]  I'm pretty good.  How are you?
L:  [LAUGH]  Real good.  [SIGH]  What a topic to choose.
R:  Ah --
L:  I just got back from my daily walk.  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Y- yeah.  [MN]  I was gonna go running today except that we had a really bad thunder --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- storm so I figured I'll be lazy.  [SIGH]
L:  Where are you from?
R:  I'm from, a- ah, -- [SIGH] I grew up in upstate New York but I ... go to school in Ohio and live there now, and I'm right now in Kentucky for the summer, doing research.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  How about you?
L:  That's neat.  I'm from De- -- I'm from the Detroit area.
R:  [SIGH]  Cool.  [SIGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK]  We have not had no --
R:  Um --
L:  -- storm so [MN] it was nice.
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  No, it was nice.  [MN]  [SIGH]  So, what do you do?  You just run --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] is that the only exercise --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you do?
R:  U- um, [SIGH] I'm kind of lazy actually, like, I ... [SIGH] start out with the best of intentions and I mostly just run because [SIGH] I live -- like for the summer right now I'm living right next to a park, and it's a really nice park and it has a running trail on it.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  So, I run about half way round that and then I kind of walk the rest of the way around it.  [SIGH]
L:  Right.
R:  And, sometimes I go swimming.  Sometimes I don't go swimming.  [SIGH]  Like, I haven't been so much 'cause I really don't like, going in the pool in my bathing suit in front of everybody.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  I do a lot of hiking and biking and stuff like that on the weekends too, --
L:  Good.
R:  -- kind of -- so ... road worrier type thing.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  What about y- you?  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  I'm strictly a walker and a bike rider.
R:  [MN]  C- cool.
L:  Um, I am terrified of water so I can't go ... in pools or stuff like that.
R:  That's too bad.
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  I can take showers but I can't take a bath.
R:  [NOISE]  Oh, no.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's how bad it was.  I don't know what happened to me when I was little but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they said [SIGH] -- the family has said something happened to me when I was little.  So, ...
R:  Oh, that's really awful.
L:  Yeah, so I do ... s- swim.  I know I'll -- you know, I forced myself to take a life saving course in that, but somebody has to be right by my side --
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
L:  -- within arm's length so I can be able to --
R:  It's --
L:  -- touch 'em.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, it's at least good that you know how in case, like, something h- happens --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and you end up in the water.  [SIGH]
L:  I'll --
R:  Do you do, like, any ... kind of weights or anything?
L:  No.  I, um, [LIPSMACK] have a missing bone in my back.  [SIGH]  So, I just --
R:  [SIGH]  Oh, God!
L:  -- yeah, I -- it was a birth defect.  So, [SIGH] I'm kind of limited as to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- what I can do --
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
L:  -- in that I can't do no floor exercises.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  If I do any aerobics it has to be the s- stand up kind.
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
L:  Not practices[?] you do off the floor or anything.  [MN]  So, it's like right now I'm just kind of stuck with bike riding and, ah, [LIPSMACK] walking --
R:  And walking.
L:  -- and that's it, you know.
R:  At least you get to see the scenery.  [MN]
L:  That's true and it does take the weight off fast.  Yeah, I was --
R:  [NOISE]  Y- yeah.
L:  -- in the past year I've lost over eighty pounds.
R:  Oh, wow!  That's good.
L:  Yeah, and just from doing those two things.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  I've not changed my diet or nothing.
R:  [NOISE]  Wow!  [MN]
L:  [NOISE]  So, that makes a big difference.
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, [SIGH] I'm signed up to do --
L:  Especially when you wear a size --
R:  Sorry?  What were you --
L:  Oh, I was a ... size twenty four.  I'm down to a size four now.
R:  My God!
L:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH]
R:  That's crazy.
L:  Yeah, since Christmas.
R:  [SIGH]  Wow!  I wish t- that I would drop weight like that [LAUGH] ... running.  I'm, like, a size t- twelve and it's not going down.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, but see with running you get muscles.
R:  [SIGH]  Y- yeah.
L:  And with me [SIGH] that's why I'm doing the walking and the biking it's because ... of all the weight loss I've got -- the extra skin that's hanging.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  And that and they keep telling me --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it has to be toned up.  I've got to exercise and that.  So, I've noticed my legs aren't ... so, um, [MN] they don't bounce a- [LAUGH] as much as they did.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Now I just need to find something to do with my arms.  [SIGH]
R:  Y- yeah.  Oh, it's too bad you don't like water and you could do, like, water aerobics or something.
L:  Uh-hum.  I thought of that but then I went and checked it out.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  In fact I just went a couple of days ago to our community center to c- check it out --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and the people are too far of a distance away --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- from one another, in the water and I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I just canned it 'cause I can't do it.
R:  [MN]
L:  [NOISE]  But I'll think of something.
R:  But what about, like, really light dumbbells or something?  [MN]
L:  I have some.  [SIGH]  But there again I have to be careful --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when I lift and that.
R:  O- o- oh!  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, 'cause it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- right at the waist that bone is missing.
R:  Y- yeah.  [MN]
L:  So, I don't know it's kind of weird.
R:  [SIGH]  Y- yeah.
L:  But I feel -- I'm okay.  I'm okay with it.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's just that, you know, [SIGH] I'm envious of people that have the very f- firm bodies from working out.  [NOISE]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  And everything because it's something that I know I cannot do, no matter how hard I try t- to do it.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  It's not something that [NOISE] I'll ever attain even though that's [SIGH] a goal of mine that, [SIGH] you know, if I could just get maybe --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] one quarter of the way there.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  [SIGH]  I think it's mostly like you've got to be kind of h- happy with yourself as you are, no matter what.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  But the physical attributes of it, you know, --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- it does prolong your life a lot.
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, --
L:  You know when you --
R:  -- it does.
L:  -- when you're healthy and everything [SIGH] you don't get the build up --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in your ... arteries --
R:  Arteries.
L:  -- blood or anything like that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you won't get the plaque if you're --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- especially running because it seems like i- it flushes out your blood system for some reason.
R:  [SIGH]  Y- yeah.  It really feels that way.  [LAUGH]  Like you get --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- like, once you're done with it you can just feel all the blood rushing through your body --
L:  Yep.  [SIGH]  And they also say --
R:  -- like crazy.
L:  -- that women that run don't get cellulite ... as, ah, um, m- more dormant person does.
R:  [MN]  Oh, I hope that --
L:  You know, like somebody --
R:  -- true.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Now, you sound young.  I'm going to put you somewhere in your twenties.
R:  [SIGH]  I'm actually --
L:  -- maybe very early --
R:  -- nineteen.
L:  -- I was going to say very early twenties --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and that.
R:  [MN]  [SIGH]  You sound like --
L:  I'm forty --
R:  -- maybe like --
L:  -- I'm forty five.
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, I was gonna guess thirties or forties.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  It's weird how you can j- [LAUGH] judge a person by their voice.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  O- o- oh!
R:  Yeah, --
L:  [MN]  Do you, um, --
R:  -- I look --
L:  -- have you ever tried that Taebo?
R:  [SIGH]  Um, I actually did the Taebo stuff sometimes in high school.
L:  Mm.
R:  Like, we had this gym class and, like, we would either have to [SIGH] do, like, scary soccer with the crazy boys.
L:  Okay.
R:  Or we would have to do Taebo.  [SIGH]  So, I always did the Taebo.  It was really funny but it was kind of fun.  [SIGH]  I want to take, like, the karate class that my college has.
L:  Oh, that would be neat.
R:  [SIGH]  I think that would be really fun.
L:  Now, my --
R:  I'm going to take a- aerobics next semester.  [SIGH]  I did that before and it's like a good work out and it's right during lunch hour so it's convenient.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]  I want to take up belly --
R:  So, ...
L:  -- dancing 'cause I hear that's [NOISE] excellent.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  And it doesn't put no strain on your back.
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, I've actually got a couple of friends who are into belly dancing 'cause we h- have all kinds of crazy classes --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- 'cause, like, we have this thing where, like, anyone who wants can teach a class and, like, [SIGH] it doesn't count towards your major or anything but it does give you course credit, like, an hour or so.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, they took this belly dancing class and they really liked it.  They all made their own belly dancing costumes and they really learned how to belly dance.  It was really cool.  [SIGH]
L:  Well, that's neat.  That was neat.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I think it's a beautiful dance.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  And it's like --
R:  It's really gorgeous.
L:  -- no matter how heavy --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- some of these women are --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- 'cause m- my daughter is part Arabic [MN] and a lot --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- of her aunts on her father's side all do the belly dancing and some of them are two ton Tessies, I mean [SIGH] hugos[?].
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  And it's like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they do the belly dancing and it's like you -- you don't ... they're firm --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know what I'm saying?
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  They're not -- do- doing the jello jiggle or anything.  [LAUGH]
R:  It really, like, emphasizes, like, curvy voluptuous, sort of, women.
L:  Uh-hum.  Yes, it does.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [MN]  And I think that's what our whole goal in --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- any type of exercise is.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah.  [NOISE]  Accentuate the positive.
L:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  We try.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, gosh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It doesn't matter how young, how old --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- or [LAUGH] whatever.  [LAUGH]
R:  Y- yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  But, you know, we all -- we have our deep ... little dark secrets, you know, of what we need to work o- on.  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]  Y- yeah, [LAUGH] sometimes not so secret, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- unfortunately.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  So, do you run, like, a half mile, a quarter mile, a full mile?
R:  Um, I -- right now I'm running about a mile.  I want to get it up.  [NOISE]  I used to run a l- lot more when I was little.  I had some problems with my knees.  So, [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- like, now my knees are fine again so I'm trying to get back up to, like, [SIGH] a few miles a day.  [SIGH]
L:  Wow!
R:  But I, like, run for about a mile and then I -- w- walk pretty fast for the rest of the little running course which is, ah, about two and a half miles long, I think.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Do you carry water with you when you do it?
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Well, since it's like right next door to my house -- I probably should carry water but I d- drink, [SIGH] like, a little bit of water before and a lot of water after.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, as I say too bad you couldn't freeze a couple of bottles [SIGH] and carry 'em like weights.
R:  [MN]  [SIGH]  Y- yeah.  I was thinking about doing that but [SIGH] --
L:  It'd keep you from getting over heated because if you hands or feet are cold, --
R:  [MN]  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, the rest of your body seems to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- cool down too.
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, 'cause you get circulation there.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  That's a good idea.  I might try that one.  [MN]
L:  Especially in those high humid days.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, we get plenty of them in Kentucky.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Now are you in the --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- n- northern section?
R:  [LAUGH]  What?
L:  Are you in the northern section?
R:  [SIGH]  Um, I'm in Lexington which is, like, ... n- northern, kind of, central.
L:  Okay.
R:  Kind of inbetween.  [SIGH]
L:  O- o- oh!
R:  It's like [SIGH] -- as much like the south as you can get without, like, being in the real south.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  And you're in Detroit you said?
L:  Uh-hum.  I'm just outside of Detroit.  I'm south of Detroit, about twenty miles.
R:  Cool.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  Is there, like, hotness or anything there t- that interferes with ... exercising or whatever?  [SIGH]
L:  Um, [SIGH] no, 'cause we have pretty much a mile climate.  It stays --
