R:  [NOISE] Hello.
L:  Hello, hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  I'm Loretta.
R:  I'm Jason, how are you doing?
L:  Fine.
R:  Have you done this before?
L:  No, I haven't.
R:  [NOISE] me.
L:  I -- I've gotten a few calls before but they could never find another person.
R:  Oh, really.
L:  So, I would just hang on the line -- hang on the line, finally I'd have to give up. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, this is my first time, I haven't just -- I mean, I was on the phone one second.  So, what do we -- what are we supposed to do?
L:  Just talk about the topic, I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- guess.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, fun --
L:  Do you exercise regularly?
R:  Um, I mean, I -- not regularly --
L:  No.
R:  -- but I exercise.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I'm a college student, so I'm always doing something.
L:  Running around class to class?
R:  Yeah.  How about you?
L:  Or -- or -- or partying, would that be considered exercise?
R:  Pretty much.
L:  Okay, [LAUGH] I know how it goes.
R:  [LAUGH] Do you exercise regularly?
L:  Um, yeah.  Two -- well, at least twice a week --
R:  What do you do?
L:  -- sometimes three to four.  I walk, I ride a bike.  I ride my bike about five miles.
R:  That's good.
L:  Or walk a mile, depending on how the kids are, so ...
R:  Do you ever do races or anything?
L:  No, no, no, no.  I'm not that athletic, I'm just -- I'm working on losing, uh, pregnancy weight right now, I got ten more pounds to go, so ...
R:  Uh, okay.  Okay, I've had seven swim in the last couple of weeks -- getting back into that, I'm home for the summer and have a pool, so --
L:  Oh, that's a good source.
R:  Yeah, I mean, that's --
L:  That is a very good source. [LAUGH]
R:  It's tough but, you know, I'm in -- I used to -- I used to swim, I wa- -- I used to be on the swim team y- years ago and getting back into it you really remember how hard it was.
L:  Oh, yeah, definitely, I haven't swam in years.  I used to love swimming, but I -- I live in Michigan now, so it's not -- like, there's a lot of access.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't know where you're from but --
R:  I'm in Miami actually.
L:  Miami --
R:  -- so --
L:  -- oh yeah --
R:  -- they're a dime a dozen here. [LAUGH]
L:  -- well there's a lot of warm weather for that kind of stuff down there then.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, it's cold up here most of the time, so --
R:  Yeah, I go to school in Chicago, so I'm used to that. [SIGH] But, uh, yeah, not many pools in Chicago that we can use most of the year.
L:  Yeah, for real, 'specially in the winter.
R:  Yep.
L:  Like, where do you go, what do you do, then you have to join a health club and that costs money --
R:  Yeah, that's a pain.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  We got -- like, we have a nice one at school, so that's good.
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  Um, I mean, I go in and play basketball and stuff, you know, pick up games.  Um, I don't know what else. [SIGH]
L:  No, I just mainly do the walking, the walking and the riding and chasing kids all day.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I guess that would be considered exercise too. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that'll -- that sure burns you out, yeah.
L:  It does, it burns you out real quick.
R:  Interesting.
L:  I do childcare, so I'm chasing after kids all day.
R:  Okay. [LAUGH] It's kind of like just sitting on the phone, huh?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Doing this for extra college income, kind of thing?
R:  Pretty much.  How did you find out about it?
L:  Um, I'm trying to think of where I did.  I went to a website and they had different, um -- oh, I believe it was -- I think I went to the -- actually the college text book buy back and then the site that I got referred to from that, 'cause I do take classes full time online --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and I got referred out to a site for -- get paid for surveys online --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then I ended up finding that site, the Fisher site on one of those sites for, um, you know, the phone calls.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I was, like, "Well, you know, shoot". [LAUGH]
R:  You might as well.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah, yeah, you never know --
L:  You talk for ten minutes --
R:  -- but this one looked more legitimate --
L:  -- and you can get ten bucks, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- why not?
R:  This one looked more legitimate than most.
L:  Exactly.  If you have to pay out money you know it's a scam.
R:  Yeah, but --
L:  -- but if it's for something you can sign up for and it's free then you definitely know that --
R:  Especially coming from Penn, I mean, it's a major university, it's not like --
L:  Exactly.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know what else.
L:  Yeah, ten minutes is a long time when you don't know somebody. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Especially when you have to talk, like, about one specific topic, you know.  Um --
L:  So, are you in generally good health?
R:  Uh, yeah, generally.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Pretty much.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But, yeah, it wouldn't hurt to do more exercise, but --
L:  No, it never hurts.
R:  I'm lazy.
L:  There's a difference between lazy and being tired out though.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If your schedule's keeping you tired, it's hard to get motivated to do it anyway.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I -- see, I'm not a morning person and --
L:  Oh, me neither, I'm a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- night person hard core. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, so it's -- the last thing I'm going to do is get up early to do that, so ...
L:  Exactly.  I keep saying that to myself, "I should start getting up really early in the morning before the kids get over here --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I'm, like, "No, I can't do it". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I don't know what --
L:  I'm, like, dragging myself out of bed in the morning with two pots of coffee just to get going.
R:  Yeah, you know, the exercise is one thing but getting up early is a whole another accomplishment --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- you know, it's a whole -- another feat.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And by the time I get home, you know, I mean, I start class late when -- when I'm at school, it's just that by the time I get home the last thing I want to do is go work out.
L:  Right.  I used to do that after my classes, a lot of the, um, health clubs up here stay open really late --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- some of them do and after, um, my -- last year I was taking a couple of semesters at the college and I'd get out of school and I'd go straight to the gym --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and come home late.  But, then I was up for four or five hours because I was so wound up from it.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I know.  But, I mean, I -- like, I go swimming -- I'm going to go swimming then I can -- you know, in twenty minutes and I'm just going to be out --
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, I -- I [NOISE] go to bed at one, get up at seven thirty.
L:  No, it's not for me, that's for sure.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Do you get up at seven thirty?
R:  Yeah, well that's what I've been doing over the summer, I've been having less sleep over the summer than I do at school normally, 'cause I'm working full time.
L:  So, do you work --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when you're at school or ...?
R:  Uh, I've got some side jobs but, um, [LIPSMACK] nothing that's like, in terms of stable hours.
L:  Right, just here and there?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Gotcha.
R:  Uh, some small projects that bring in money, but I don't need to -- you know, not a typical nine to five.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] Which is nice.
L:  Yeah, I'm working on that trying to find something that's not a nine to five -- [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a work at home thing.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I was actually looking through a home business connection magazine that I got in the mail today -- [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- when Fisher called, [NOISE] so ...
R:  What kind of options?
L:  Um, oh gosh, there's a huge book on it.  Um, they show different opportunities and websites and eight hundred numbers you can call for information.
R:  Mm.
L:  It's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in a -- it's in a entrepreneur magazine, so I know a lot of it can be a bunch of, you know, bull.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  So, how long were you sitting on the phone just now?
L:  Um -- just a minute  --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- I was punching in, you know, they were -- they wanted to know what kind of phone I was using.
R:  Yeah, they must have -- I mean, good advertising to have people waiting on them, you know, like some of them --
L:  They must do, yeah.  Though the last couple of times they called though, I sat on the other line waiting for somebody else to join in on the topic and --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- they couldn't locate anybody -- couldn't locate anybody, so finally after about ten minutes I had to hang up.  I was, like, I can't sit on the phone --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- all night.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I got, I mean, I signed up this afternoon, [NOISE] I think I checked off, like, eight o'clock --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- as the earliest hour and I got a call at five to eight on my cell phone and I couldn't take it so I just got -- finally got in and called back.  Um, is there a li- can you only do it one time a day or something, as on --
L:  Um, no I think --
R:  -- the same topic?
L:  -- that they can call you more than once a day, I'm not sure though, I've only gotten one call usually.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I been getting, like, three calls a week though, so --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- at least.
R:  We generally do it a max of three times.
L:  I'm not sure, I think you can do it -- I mean, if your availability's open, you know, like Monday through Sunday --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- whatever your availability hours that you signed up on, that they should be able to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- contact you.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I signed up from ten to twelve at night 'cause that's when --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- my kids are in bed and asleep, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, I've been getting calls, you know -- I've only been doing it for two weeks and this week my phone finally started ringing for it and I've gotten three calls already.
R:  Hm.
L:  But two out of the three they couldn't locate anybody. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Uh, then I get this thing -- I think it's a [inaudible] for males -- you get even more money.
L:  Oh, if you are -- for a man?
R:  Yeah, they- they're short males.
L:  Oh, really.
R:  So, they'll give you a dollar for each guy that signs up.
L:  Oh, really, interesting.
R:  And if you get ten they'll give you an additional five dollar bonus.
L:  Oh, yeah, I -- I thought I saw something about that, I didn't really take too much of attention to it though.
R:  Uh.  So, I got to convince all my friends to do it, but they're like, "No way".
L:  Why not? [LAUGH]
R:  That's what I'm saying, "You might as well".
L:  It's ten minutes, shoot, you know.
R:  Yeah. [PAUSE]
L:  Tick, tick.
R:  [NOISE] Let's see what time, uh?
L:  I don't know how long it's been.
R:  It's been ten and a half on my phone, but that's I guess since the call started.
L:  Right.
R:  So ...
L:  Should be popping up pretty soon.  What did you say your name was again?
R:  Jason. [NOISE]
L:  Jason, okay.  I was just getting ready for the store. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] [PAUSE] [NOISE]
L:  So, is it raining out, oh wait --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- yeah, you live in Miami, right?
R:  Yeah, so summer's the rainy season, but it's not that rainy today, it rained a lot last week, so this week is supposed to be nicer.  It's too hot though, way too humid.
L:  A couple more minutes, I don't know. [NOISE] Oh, it's chilly out tonight, it's in the low seventies.
