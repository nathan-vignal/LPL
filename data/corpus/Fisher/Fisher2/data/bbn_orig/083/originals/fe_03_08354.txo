L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  Uh, I'm Claire.
R:  Hi, Claire, this is Deborah.
L:  Deborah.  Um, so where you from?
R:  I'm -- I live in Hawaii, where do you live?
L:  Oh my goodness, I'm in New Jersey. [LAUGH]
R:  New Jersey?  Oh wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, it must be six o'clock there.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, so health and fitness.  We're supposed to talk about whether we exercise regularly?
L:  Right.
R:  Okay, how about you?
L:  Um, yeah, I go to the gym about, uh, twice a week, I think, and, I don't know, I do, like, weights and a little cardio vascular, like running and, uh, I used to run cross country and track in high school but, um, I sort -- I kind of -- I'm pr- I couldn't do that now.  But, um, what about you?
R:  Well, um, when I was a teenager I swam but not competitively and then when I moved to Hawaii I started doing, um, outrigger canoe paddling, which is great fun.  Huge amount of work but they made me run and I joined paddling because I didn't want to run.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I was horrified --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- when they told me I had to run and so what's funny now is thirty years later, it's one of my favorite ways to do -- to do exercise.  I love running now.  And so I run -- I do triathlons.  I do little ones, um, like the -- the Lavaman which is the Olympic distance.
L:  Wow.
R:  And, um, I come in third or fourth in my age group but I figure if I wait long enough I'll come in [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Wow, that's still really good though. [LAUGH]
R:  -- I'll come in ...  Yeah, so anyway, um, I, um -- I just read this book recently called Mind Body and Sports --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- uh, where he says that, um, your goal has to be to do anything effortlessly and I used to think, you know, Poppov talks about [LIPSMACK] reach -- reach, rhythm and relax and so I've been working on rhythm and relax but this is a new one, effortless so I'm trying this lately.
L:  So, what effortle- like -- like something that, like, I mean, running, is that supposed to be effortless because you don't really, like, think about it, you just do it?  Or effort- I don't really understand what that means. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well I always found it a little bit confusing to do relaxed and go fast --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- but -- but I think I've figured it out and, um, the -- I -- I personally thing that everything is -- everything in this world is purely mental --
L:  Uh-huh
R:  -- and -- because everything I think long enough usually happens to me.  And so, um, so I think the relaxation and the rhythm are mental qualities that we demonstrate physically and so, um, effortless is a new one, it's like they say that being in the zone, one of the things everyone describes it as is effortless, that you can it like you're not even participating, it's just do mo- going through the motions.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I've only had that happen a couple of times in swimming and maybe one time -- one time I had it happen in paddling and, um, another time I had it -- a couple of times in running but running to me is really nice because if I start off slow -- I run around a track at my school and the view is gorgeous at this place and -- and so I time each lap around and, um, I've been -- I started off doing around twelve -- twelve minute miles and I'm now down to somewhere between eight and nine.  And I'm real happy about that, you know.
L:  Wow, that's great.
R:  Yeah, 'cause when I was twenty years old there's no way I could go this fast, you know, so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- they say what do you do no- I tell people now that I've hit fifty plus I'm faster at biking, faster at --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- swimming and faster at running. [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.  That's great. [LAUGH]
R:  But, um, anyway, so, um --
L:  Oh.  Well, it sounds like you're in really good shape. [LAUGH] I, um [LIPSMACK] -- I just read this article about, uh, that people's brain tissue starts to shrink like when they're around, like, thirty and, uh, it only shrinks about, like, fifteen percent and, um, but, like, if you exercise then that reduces the shrinkage and so, um -- especially in women actually, like, you -- um, they did an experiment [NOISE] in comparing people who didn't exercise with people who did and people who, um, had like -- mm, they just showed better, like, cognitive improvement from exercise than the men did.
R:  Huh.  Huh, yeah, I read a study in the, um, [LIPSMACK] the -- the medical journal, the thing that they put our yearly that said, this was in ninety nine two, that said that, um, [LIPSMACK] men who marry women that are more educated than them, die sooner than men who marry women who are less educated that them --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so after reading that I'm not too -- I'm too, um, uh -- I don't believe most studies I read. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh okay. [LAUGH]
R:  I'm not saying yours is wrong I'm just saying that, you know, studies can --
L:  I know, it's like --
R:  -- studies can be funny, you know, it's like [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but anyway, um, fitness, yeah I -- I think -- I shared this with the last person I spoke -- I thought the topic would change each time but it didn't and, uh --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and the -- and I discovered years ago something I read about we don't get fit we demonstrate fitness and get fit implies that we're running out all the time and that we have to accumulate it, which is what the industry wants you to think.  Whereas demonstrating fitness to me means -- the way I figured it out was that if somebody was nine hundred pounds, if they could still walk across the room they were demonstrating some degree of fitness as opposed to somebody that weight who's just bedridden.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, fitness is on a continuum, I think, um, with, um, you know [SIGH] -- if you think -- it's like -- it's like the difference between the, um, student centered learning and teacher centered learning, you know, teacher centered learning believes that, you know, open your mouth, I'll pour in the information, whereas, uh, student centered learning believes you've got everything you need and all I do is facilitate you figuring it out and so, I think, fitness is like that too.  I think that we demonstrate fitness, which I think is a spiritual quality and, uh, and so therefore there's not reason to feel discouraged no matter what level we're at or wherever we start, it's personal.
L:  Oh yeah, that's a nice way of looking at it.  Um, I think Andre Agassi is, like, I don't he's sort of a Zen master or something and like he -- he -- he gets in the zone, like that's how he does so well at tennis.  So, that's what I've heard.
R:  Um, yeah, he -- do you -- you like tennis?
L:  Um, yeah, actually I haven't played in a really long time but, um, I hav- I do like it.  I don't watch it that much but --
R:  Yeah, I'm only -- I'm only peripherally interested because my aunt is a tennis addict and so at four in the morning the -- you know, if I'm visiting her the TV goes on to watch Wimbledon or, you know, or -- [LAUGH]
L:  Oh wow, that's really dedicated. [LAUGH]
R:  But I -- I met a, um, um, NBA player, uh, I can't remember his name, he's got a twin, he's got such a cool name too.  He used to play for the Magics and then he played for the Lakers for one year and I don't know where he is now, and he came into where I was working and I asked him, you know, "Are you a -- a NBA player?" He goes, "Yeah".  I said, "I got a question for you".  He goes, "What?"  And I said, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- "Do you realize that, you know, that -- I mean, is your game purely mental?"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And he goes, "What do you mean?"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I says, "Well, you know how we -- you- your playing basketball and everything's clicking and nothing's going wrong and you could ma- --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- you couldn't do it wrong if you tried?" And he goes, "Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah".  I says, "Well, you gotta know that's more than muscle" and he goes, "Oh yeah, of course".  And well he started describing all this -- 'cause I wanted to an international athlete about this, right, not just, uh, amateurs.  And, uh, he verified what I believed that, you know, if you visualize it and you -- [LIPSMACK] and you, um, you translate things into thoughts, um, you're gonna have a wonderful experience no matter how fast you're going.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, I think if you like mentally prepare yourself or something it -- it just totally changes the experience, like, if, uh, you kinda like catch yourself off guard or decide to do it, like, without really thinking then, it's like --
R:  Oh, we got --
L:  -- comes out half as good.  Oh, did we get cut off. [NOISE]
R:  No, not yet, I don't think [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They're cutting us off in about a minute, I think, but, I mean, um, so, um -- so what -- what kind of work do you do?
L:  Um, I'm only s- n- uh, I'm only twenty one so I'm in college.
R:  You're in college?
L:  Yeah.
R:  What's your major?
L:  Um, I go to arts school.
R:  Oh cool.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, my mom was an artist she -- she liked to sculpture.
L:  Oh okay.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Huh.  So, what's your -- what's your art?
L:  Um, I wanna be an illustrator.
R:  Oh, very nice.  Do you like the school you're going to?
L:  Yeah, it's, uh -- it's in Greenwich Village in [NOISE] Manhattan so it's very trendy and, um -- that's like a little -- I don't know, I don't think -- I'm a little more traditional but it's fun, like, I'm excited about it.
R:  [NOISE] Huh, so you're a traditional artist?
