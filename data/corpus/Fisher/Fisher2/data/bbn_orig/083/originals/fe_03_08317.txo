L:  Oh, hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello there.  Yes, uh, who am I speaking with?
R:  This is Stephanie.  I live in New Jersey.
L:  Oh, Stephanie, in New Jersey.  Okay.  This is Darryl.  I live in, uh, North Carolina.
R:  Oh, beautiful area.
L:  Yeah.  It -- it's nice down here.  We've had, uh -- we've had some rain lately.  A few thunder storms come through, you know, typical, uh, summer weather.
R:  Supposed to cool things off but it doesn't.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, supposedly.  Yeah.  So, are you into fitness?
R:  Yes, I am.  Very much so.  I'm --
L:  Oh, what did you -- what do you do?
R:  Everything.  Walk, bike ride, swim --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Anything I can -- roller blade with my daughter.  Anything I can do --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- just to stay healthy.  Uh --
L:  Oh, yeah, r- -- now, I've -- I've never been much into roller blading I know, but that's a good thing you can do with your daughter and have a lot of fun and just, you know, how -- spend quality time with her and all.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  I bet she really -- I bet she really enjoys that.
R:  She does.  She does.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I roller skated a lot as a kid and then --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- as you get older you stop, you know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And the first time I saw these things I thought, "How am I going to do this?  But they're so much --"
L:  Oh.
R:  -- easier than roller skates.  It's amazing.
L:  Oh, really?  Uh-huh, I've never --
R:  They're so much easer.
L:  I never have been roller blading so I wouldn't -- I wouldn't know too much experience on that.  You know, just, uh, I do some, uh, uh, walking, running, uh, I -- I enjoy playing tennis.
R:  Right, right.
L:  That's the thing -- that's the thing I -- I like[?] to do.  And --
R:  I started lifting weights recently only --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- because I'm -- I'm probably the only person in America trying to gain weight. [LIPSMACK] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Because every other --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- infomercial and every other advertising is, "Wanna lose weight?"
L:  Lose weight, yeah.
R:  I'm four foot eleven.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I've weighed about ninety pounds my whole life.  I mean, I stopped growing when --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I was eleven or twelve.
L:  Yeah?
R:  And, um, people think I am a lot younger than I am.  We just got back from vacation and they --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- have that guess your age thing and win a prize and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- no one even comes close.
L:  Nobody [LAUGH] boy --
R:  I'm thirty six.
L:  -- you could wipe a -- yeah, you can wipe 'em out, can ya?  I guess you get a -- a teddy bear every time, don't ya?
R:  Every time.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm thirty six and some man recently remarked, "Uh, --"
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you're about eighteen".  And I'm like --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- my daughter's standing right next to me.  She's the same size as I am.  I'm not eighteen, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I'm just real tiny and I just try to --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- stay fit because, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I was reading recently about osteoporosis and women who are in the, um, the high risk categories and it turns out that the smaller you are the more fragile your bones are and so on.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I, you know, we live in an area where, you know, it -- it's very rural.  You can bike ride, you can roller blade and bicycle.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, I don't see a reason why you wouldn't because I see these people get older locally, um, they -- they can hardly move.  They shuffle along and I'm like, "I never wanna be that way".
L:  Yeah.
R:  I never want to get to the point where I can't get out of bed or everything --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- aches me.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I just figure that if you stay fit and you stay flexible you'll always be that way.
L:  Right, uh-huh.
R:  If you stop exercising then you'll become just, you know, your -- your muscles will just, you know, become very weak and then you won't --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- be able to do those things.
L:  Yeah, it's kinda like just saying if you don't, uh, use it you lose it.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  You know, mhm.
R:  Absolutely, and I --
L:  Yeah. [COUGH] 
R:  -- love bicycling.  I finally went and bought myself a brand --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- new bike last year or the year before --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You look great in that.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And, um, my daughter just bought a new outfit.  She's showing --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it off. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's like back to school shopping very early. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I see. [LAUGH] 
R:  But, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, so I just love it.
L:  So, you have a good area up there you say where you can roller blade and ride bikes.  Are you close to a park?  Is it --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- a park or a just a street or how -- how's that work?
R:  It's actually a square.  We are -- I'm from --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- New York originally.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And we moved out to north west New Jersey right by the Delaware water gap --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- where people don't lock their cars and they don't lock their doors and it was a big old culture --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- shock, type thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, but we're actually in a very small Victorian area, almost like Cape May, New Jersey.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  All the old Victorian homes that go on tour once a year and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there's a town square which is actually a park.  You can play --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- ball in there.  There's a couple of places to bike ride and play basketball.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So, they're there.  They're available to you.  Um, they're --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- not riding on the side of a highway, you know, and --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- there's enough roller rinks around us also where you can do that and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I was recently looking into either skiing up in the Pokonos or ice skating --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- 'cause I've never done either one and I thought --
L:  Yeah.
R:  "Well, there's something that looks like fun".
L:  Yeah.
R:  My husband's like, "Not me". [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  He's in the process of, um -- he's on an Atkins type, um, eating plan.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So he's lost like twenty eight pounds in the past, I'd say, three months and --
L:  Oh, so he's trying to lose weight.  Is that -- is that his --
R:  Right, am I'm trying to gain weight.
L:  You're trying to gain weight.
R:  I'm like if they could just take it off of you and put it on me.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  They're recording me [inaudible].
L:  [LAUGH] It just doesn't work that does it?
R:  No, it doesn't.  No, it doesn't.
L:  Uh, what -- what do you do -- what are you doing to kinda help, uh, gain weight or -- or what -- whatever.  I -- I'm just curious to know what you're doing, you know, to try to gain weight.  What --
R:  Yeah, I actually --
L:  Do you drink a lot of protein shakes or anything like this?
R:  Not the -- really not protein just regular --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- good old fashioned milkshakes.  I mean --
L:  Oh.  Oh --
R:  I --
L:  Just a high calorie type milkshake?
R:  Just high calories.  Anything he can't eat I do eat so --
L:  Oh.
R:  It's like, "Are you gonna finish that?  I'll take it".  You know. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  What -- what do you eat?  I'm -- I'm curious to know that too.
R:  I eat five -- I actually been to doctors since I was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- eleven and twelve.  Um, you know, my parents thought I was a dwarf or something.  I just stopped growing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they took bone marrow and did all this testing and said, "She just stopped growing.  There's nothing wrong with her".
L:  Mm.
R:  Um, I became pregnant with my daughter ten years ago.  I gained the average twenty eight pounds.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The minute she was born I -- it came right off of me.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I was back in my summer dresses.  Everyone's like, "Okay, you don't look like you just had a baby".
L:  Wow.
R:  So, as I spoke to my doctors as I got older I was like, "Okay, what do I do?"  You know, I'm -- I'm tired.  People would look -- people are very rude.  You know, I would never walk up to --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- an overweight person and say, "Should you really be eating those french fries?"
L:  Yeah.
R:  I would never do that.  But --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- people don't see anything wrong with walking up to me like in a store and clothes shop and going, "Oh, my God, you're so skinny.  Oh, you're s- --" 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you look sick".  We were just --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- at the grocery store --
L:  Yeah.
R:  My daughter was joking around with me.  She was doing this pig[?] latin --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it sounded like she called me chubby.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I said, "Did you just call me chubby?"  We're --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- goofing around with each other and a woman that we've never seen before turned around and said --
L:  Mhm.
R:  "You called your mother chubby?  She's anorexic".  And I'm like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "Huh".  And was just stunned.  I was just mortified.  I'm like --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I know I'm small and skinny.  Hello. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It was so rude.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Basically doctors have told me --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [inaudible] instead of eating three square meals a day eat --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- five smaller meals a day and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- snack in between and it's been helping.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  I eat everything.  I've cut out beef and -- I cut out beef and pork years ago.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I just didn't think it was a very healthy thing, you know, for your --
L:  Right.
R:  Um, clogs the arteries --
L:  Well --
R:  -- and stuff, so --
L:  Right.  Yeah, st- -- any- anything related to meat, you know, is -- is supposed to be really bad for you, you know.
R:  Right, right.
L:  I've cut back on that a lot although I do enjoy, you know, an occasional steak, you know, 'cause I like -- I like a steak, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  A good steak is hard to resist, you know.
R:  Sure.
L:  And -- and I love fish.  Do you eat fish?  
R:  Yes.  It's very --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- very healthy.  Lots of salmon.
L:  Mhm, yeah, yeah.
R:  Um, omega threes and all that stuff.
L:  Right, right, mm.
R:  Um, but it seems to be, you know, working 'cause I'm actually --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- putting on weight.  I mean, everyone says your --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- body changes every seven years and I turned thirty five last year and now that I'm thirty six I'm actually putting --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- on weight without any trouble.  I'm like, "Well, this is interesting", you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, but I also read recently that muscle weighs more than fat.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So, I thought, "Okay, if I lift --"
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  -- some small weights, maybe I can build --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- up my arms, get some muscle --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in my arms, beat my daughter at arm wrestling maybe some day. [LIPSMACK] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah. 
R:  [LAUGH] And, um --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And obviously weigh more at the doctor's office, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, that's basically it and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] now the area you live in is that --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- also is it a -- a very busy -- it's like a city area or --
L:  Uh, yeah, it's a s- -- it's a small city, um, you know, bigger than a town and what you would think a town but it's just a -- it's, uh, [SIGH] um, it's not the biggest city in North Carolina.  We're probably maybe number five.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, and we're --
R:  Right.
L:  -- up near the mountains but we have, uh, uh, sidewalks.  We're on city streets here and we can walk or jog or anything but they also -- there's a park.  It's about a half a mile away, you know, at the tennis courts and basketball courts and -- and, uh   So, uh, it's a good --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- place, you know, to -- to hang out and it's also got a pretty good place [inaudible] ride bikes.  There's [inaudible] bike trail.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, that people ride.  Also a jogging trail.  So, uh, i- it's conveniently located to us.  It's just that, well I need to maybe use it more than what I do.  You know, I -- I try to do that and, um, basically the thing I -- I kinda do is a rebounder.  Y- -- are you familiar with rebounding?
R:  No, I'm not.
L:  No?  Okay, it's kinda like a mini trampoline.
R:  [SIGH] Oh, my --
L:  And you jump up and down on that and, uh, you don't have to jump high.  It's not -- you don't have to -- it's -- it -- you know, you can use it inside when -- when the weather's bad outside you can, you know, it's hot or cold outside.  It doesn't matter.  You can --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- use a -- this --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- mini trampoline and it -- it helps to -- it actually exercises cells.
R:  Mm.
L:  A lot of people, you know, they think about exercising their muscles but they don't think about exercising their cells.
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  And your cells need to be exercised too because --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- they've gotta be -- they've gotta be flushed out.  You've gotta also get food into your cells 'cause the cell, you know, is mainly where life and death begin, you know, in the cell.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, it's -- it's important that we keep, uh, keep our cells exercised.  So, when you're bouncing up and down, uh, you're going up and down on the trampoline you're exercising your cells.  You're -- you're -- you're -- helping it get --
R:  I've never heard of that.
L:  Yeah.  You're getting rid of the waste that's in the cells.  You're getting rid of the carbon dioxide and you're bringing your oxygen come in -- come into the cells.  Helping get food and oxygen, you know, from the blood and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- this type of thing.  So, it's a -- and not -- not a lot of people maybe have -- have heard about that.  I read a book on that one time by this, uh, doctor and also --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- this former, uh, well he's an Olympic trainer.  He -- he kind of trains the, um, uh, the last Olympics, uh, two Olympics -- I should say, uh, weight training --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- for the men.  He was -- he -- he wrote a book talking about, uh, about the cell exercise.  How it's important to exercise your cells as well as your muscles.
R:  That's very interesting.  I've never ever --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- heard of that and I'll probably --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- be looking into that today because --
L:  Yeah.  You can get a book.  You can probably go to the library, go to the book store, health -- health food store, you know, book stores and just, uh --
R:  Right.
L:  -- check out some of the books.  It's, um, anything on the rebounding.  That's -- that's the -- that's the, uh, I guess the, uh, official term for it's called rebounding.
R:  That's amazing.
L:  Mhm.  That's something you may want to look in- --
R:  That sounds incredible.  That's something I've never l- -- I mean, we've done, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  My husband started out with juicing, you know, uh --
L:  Mhm, yeah, yeah.  I've heard of people doing that.  Uh-huh.
R:  And he was so into it and he was losing weight.  A little bit here, a little bit there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And what frustrates me about him
