L:  [NOISE] Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  [NOISE] Hi.
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  [NOISE] Good, how are you?
R:  Oh, I'm okay.
L:  I'm Michelle.
R:  My name is Anne, and you?
L:  [MN] Michelle.
R:  Michelle? [SIGH] What did they just say?  I always have a problem hearing when she gives us the specifics of what the topic is supposed to be.  Sometimes the voice is so distorted [SIGH] that I can't hear what it is, and now she just said -- [SIGH] what was it?  About censorship, that we're --
L:  Yeah, I -- I think it was, [NOISE] um, [SIGH] do we believe that private schools [NOISE] and public schools have the right to censor what books are read.  I don't know if they said --
R:  What books are read.  That could be, that sounds like that might have been right.  I'm not --
L:  But I don't know if it's, like, the gover- if the government censors 'em, or whether the schools actually censor them.
R:  [NOISE] Um, well, [SIGH] that's --
L:  Who knows?
R:  -- a good question [SIGH] because at certain points things like Mark Twain have been censored, right?  You know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] I'm not sure.
L:  Actually, you know what it is?  I think it must be the schools, 'cause isn't that --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- the -- [MN] no, I don't know if that's dependent --
R:  It's not only schools, it's the parents, right, because look what happened with Harry Potter, right?  Within the last year there was this, uh, you know, thing about the -- [SIGH] you know, the, um, Christian, you know, coalition said that they were -- felt they were encouraging witchcraft among the s-
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- kids and all that, so [SIGH] I don't think it's the government, but the government -- what was the thing about the, um [NOISE] -- [SIGH] about the, um [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- about the, uh -- the pledge of allegiance?  That some people didn't want them saying, um [LIPSMACK] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] um --
L:  They didn't want them saying them saying pledge of --
R:  Yeah, they didn't --
L:  -- al- allegiance?
R:  -- want them saying the pledge of allegiance because of the separation of church and state.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh.
R:  Yeah, [NOISE] that was, like, a year or two ago, they were saying that, um, [SIGH] that's --
L:  Maybe that's a little -- reading into it [LAUGH] too much, I think.
R:  Yeah, it seems a little extreme, because, you know, you -- you shouldn't have to put your hand over your heart and say, "I pledge al- [MN] [MN] unto God --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- when they should, under God, indivisible [MN]". [SIGH] But then there was a big deal about, uh, prayer and whether or not -- um, [SIGH] whether or not, um, [LIPSMACK] a voluntary prayer before football games should be allowed because --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- there were groups of student who wanted to get together and pray, just like -- I guess like they do at A.A. meetings, right?
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  -- You know, [SIGH] big deal.  So what if they do?  And then some --
L:  Yeah, that's, um --
R:  -- people were [MN] speaking out against it, you know. [SIGH] But I guess that's not really what they mean by censorship, you know. [MN] 
L:  Yeah, I mean, I think in terms of this, uh, [NOISE] w- with censoring books, uh, I -- I don't know, to a certain extent there -- there are --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- responsible people [SIGH] choosing these books and --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- [SIGH] life is filled with controversy, [LIPSMACK] so I don't think there's a problem with it.  If something's completely inappropriate then, sure, censor it, but, [SIGH] I mean, [NOISE] I read books in high school that [SIGH] I guess were considered [NOISE] controversial but if -- if --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- stuff like Mark Twain were --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it's not.  I mean, it's good to know things.
R:  It' --
L:  I don't know.
R:  -- ridiculous --
L:  Yeah, that is --
R:  -- to say that because there --
L:  -- ridiculous.
R:  -- was a slave in it that -- you know, because that's what's --
L:  I mean, the -- yeah, that's reality.
R:  -- getting a lot of attention now is that black people are offended by the fact that there was Nigger Jim or whatever, the word is in there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right. [SIGH] That's what's going on now and this -- [SIGH] I saw something on the -- uh, a program on channel thirteen that had a lady and her daughter and the -- the woman, [SIGH] you know, who was African American was saying she didn't want that book taught anymore because she found it [NOISE] painful and offensive [SIGH] to have --
L:  [SIGH] I mean, I can understand that, but at the same time it's a reflection of the time it was written.
R:  [SIGH] [NOISE] 
L:  I can understand that and I can respect that [SIGH] but if -- if someone is -- knows --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [MN] what the deal is with it then, like, "Listen, this is in a time where, [SIGH] you know --"
R:  This is a part of American history --
L:  Yeah, and --
R:  -- and if -- to forget it is to make it maybe happen again, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  It would be like saying, "Oh, well, [SIGH] the holocaust never happened" or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- "Roman slavery never happened" or, [SIGH] you know, any atrocity that has ever happened in the world, we must not read about it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We must not read [SIGH] like, uh, The Diary of Anne Frank or something.  I don't know, you know, [SIGH] I'm not -- you know, I -- I'm not personally touched by the holocaust, I'm not Jewish, but people do say, "Let's n- never [NOISE] forget, you know, blah blah blah". [SIGH] So, why would anyone say, "Well, we must not read this book about a slave and [SIGH] Huckleberry Finn going down the river" when they became so humanly involved with each other, they became such good friends [SIGH] that the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the upshot of the book is a really positive one.  So, why say, "Oh, no, I don't want these words ever uttered in my daughter's ears"? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I don't -- [SIGH] I don't understand that, you know. [SIGH] 
L:  I mean, yeah, if someone's [NOISE] properly taught, like, "Listen, that was --"
R:  But when you say --
L:  "-- that was history".
R:  -- you read stuff in high school, I think we all read stuff --
L:  Yeah, we all --
R:  -- probably out of school, too, you know, that we --
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  -- it's not like, "Have you read Lady Chatterley's Lover" [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] but have you read Henry Miller, [NOISE] you know, Tropic of Cancer or something like [LAUGH] that.  I'm sure we all read things that would have been censored in the school, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, [SIGH] even had comics, if you read, like, Zap comics --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [LAUGH] or something, you know. [SIGH] I don't know, [LAUGH] you know. [SIGH] There's all kinds of silly stuff with curse words in it and God knows [NOISE] w- you know, what else that would have been --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- censored. [SIGH] [MN] 
L:  Yeah, I think this is wrong.  I mean, who's to draw the line?  We have to --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- put some kind of faith in the people making the decisions, and [SIGH] a [MN] -- you know what I mean?  You can't censor everything, then a kid's [NOISE] going to --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- come out of -- they're never going to learn about [NOISE] the world, they're never going to --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- learn about anything --
R:  Uh, yeah [MN] --
L:  -- so 
R:  I agree, but it's not only that, let's look at movies, you know, and let's look at video games --
L:  Yeah, things that they have --
R:  -- right, and let's look at --
L:  -- free access to.
R:  -- rap music, right --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what's going on with that because [SIGH] there's a big thing now, a big push thing that kids are able to get these things even though they have the, um, M on them for mature [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- audiences, the video games in particular, 'cause there's that game where the kids, um -- [SIGH] they go on a street rampage and they carjack people, right?
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, my nephew is eleven and he plays that game --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and I find it rather shocking, you know.  They knock [NOISE] down prostitutes and kick them in the head and, [SIGH] you know, beat them up and all that. [SIGH] And I saw something on a -- on a show about that, where this kid who was fourteen said that [SIGH] his mom won't let him play it and, [SIGH] you know, um, [SIGH] he said that he did play it once or twice and that as he was playing it he thought, "This is too much, I don't even know why I'm doing this" you know, but [SIGH] people [MN] -- you know, I -- I don't know, I don't know if I agree that they get desensitized and that it's really, really [MN] -- [SIGH] I don't think that at his age -- but it seems also that kids are older younger now, you know, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  I feel that too, and even just -- I mean, I'm just --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- I'm in my twenties and I just notice, even now, just looking at high school kids [NOISE] now, which wasn't that far off from where I am now --
R:  Oh, well, they're just --
L:  -- they're --
R:  -- yeah, I heard this statistic, one out of four kids will get an S.T.D. before they're eighteen.
L:  Ew.
R:  I can't believe that. [LAUGH] One out of four.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  that's a -- that's not even -- we're not even talking about virginity anymore --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we're talking about getting [SIGH] I don't know what, herpes or [MN] syphilis --
L:  [NOISE] Ew.
R:  -- or something --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- before they're eighteen.  That's [NOISE] a really -- that really takes --
L:  That's bad. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you -- yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] God.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] So, um, [NOISE] [SIGH] the thing about, um, [NOISE] censorship though too, [NOISE] that's in a larger sense is the [NOISE] political censorship that's going on because they keep pointing out now about how, um, [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] President Bush seems to have a g- a [MN] -- a carte blanche, like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] whatever he does no one criticizes him in the press at all because if you do you're considered un American --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, [SIGH] and that's like a -- a big issue, you know, with the war.  You can't say anything neg- look, like the -- like the Dixie Chicks, [SIGH] you know, what happened with that, that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they made one comment and they were blackballed, you know. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] What is -- what is that about? [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] I know. [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah, I -- I don't know, this whole, like, rise of patriotism and all that, and --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- and everyone's willing to let things go --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, like, [NOISE] [MN] just because [NOISE] you -- you know, the US is at a time and place where --
R:  A crisis, because of --
L:  Yeah, yeah, it's like --
R:  -- nine eleven, right.
L:  -- yeah, it's crisis, nine eleven, the whole thing, and Bush is working that and [SIGH] because of that [NOISE] even though y- [NOISE] you know, you may not agree [NOISE] everyone just lets it go 'cause be- he's being oh so patriotic and whatever.
R:  It seems very scary that it felt like fascism.  It's like you can't say anything, you can't voice any opinion because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  And he is able to get away with a lot.
R:  Wow.
L:  So 
R:  A- and -- and the Democrats aren't doing anything [NOISE] whereas the Republicans were all over them all the time, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- all the time. [SIGH] Anyone who was, um, uh, suggested for the supreme court justice, [NOISE] you know, every -- they were digging into everybody's past, you know, [SIGH] and now it just seems like the press and the Democrats roll over for whatever [NOISE] is going to happen next, you know, it's just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] because they're afraid. I don't know what -- what -- what about the next elections, you know, uh -- [SIGH] I don't know, it's hard to -- I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  It's been through +censorship -- censorship is just like [NOISE] -- it's touchy and it's, in terms of the US, I felt that that's sort of like what the whole basis [NOISE] was.  You know, avoid censorship, obviously don't --
R:  Yeah, freedom of speech, right --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's in the constitution, you know, so it's a basic right.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, so censoring things like -- like the books and all that, again, I think it's just petty.  Its people getting [NOISE] really [NOISE] [MN] over --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- sensitive.  I don't even know what that's about 'cause the --
R:  Well, I agree with you.  That's why it's interesting that we've touched on so many different aspects of censorship, right, in what, five minutes or something --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there's not only in the personal sense of books at school, [SIGH] but also in the political sense of [SIGH] the press and [SIGH] what you can say or can't say and still be considered a --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- true American, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a -- a faithful, [SIGH] a pa- patriotic.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] which -- who knows what that means anymore 'cause the first patriots were -- [SIGH] were treasonous, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if it was someone like Patrick Henry [SIGH] that was saying, you know, "Give me liberty or give me death" because, uh, the --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- our founding fathers were revolutionaries, right?
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] And now we can't be considered patriotic if we question --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] going to war and spending a billion dollars a day to decimate Afghanistan [SIGH] or, um, Iraq.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  And these people are already dirt poor, you know, the pictures you see of these people, they have no water, [SIGH] no electricity, you know. [SIGH] Uh, especially the Afghanistan thing, th- th- they've been at war for twenty years already with --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the Russians, [SIGH] and -- and, uh, everything else [NOISE] and these people are just suffering and suffering, and then we come in and we say, "We won't leave you, don't worry". [SIGH] Well, I don't notice that we're rebuilding Afghanistan, right?  It's funny how quickly we have --
L:  Yeah, we've for-
R:  -- nothing more --
L:  -- they're forgotten. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  Nothing more in the news about that, because now we got a new front, you know, on terrorism. [SIGH] And --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- me-
