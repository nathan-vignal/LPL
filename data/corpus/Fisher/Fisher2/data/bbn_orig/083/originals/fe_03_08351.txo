L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, I'm Susie.
L:  [NOISE] This is Ally.
R:  Hi, nice to meet you.
L:  Nice to meet you.
R:  Exercising, huh?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  What you think that's a dirty word?
R:  Ugh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't do that. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  Well, I do some but I would like to do more, I just wish I had time for it.
R:  Yeah.  Uh, that's me, I just don't have the time.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I -- I waitress and I figure that's enough exercise for anybody for one day.
L:  Oh yeah, I would think so. [LAUGH] I have a -- a sedentary job so [LIPSMACK] I have to get out and do something intentionally but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Sometimes I wish I did a job like that or construction or something, you know, so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you'd get real exercise.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, I think I get [SIGH] -- sometimes I wish I could put one of those meters on me to show how many miles a day I walk [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.  Well, maybe you should do that, make you feel better. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Or make me feel more tired. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I doubt that.  But the way they count, you know, things like and, you know, housework and stuff like that as exercise nowadays --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you'd probably do pretty good. [LAUGH]
R:  So, you do exercise some?
L:  Yeah, I, uh, take karate and I have that twice a week.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Yep.
R:  Well, I bet that's neat.
L:  I enjoy it.  Course I think I enjoyed it a little more I'm -- I got my black belt about a year ago and I actually got more exercise --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- before then because now, you know, I'm teaching and so I don't get actually as much exercise out of class [LAUGH].
R:  Oh really?
L:  Yep.
R:  So, that must be neat though.
L:  Yep. [NOISE] I do enjoy it.  So -- but I'd like to start doing something else, but --
R:  That -- that's all you do, just the karate?
L:  Yeah.  Um, like I say I'd like to, you know, start doing some walking or something like that but -- [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, that's six hours a week so [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh gosh.
L:  -- so that's a lot of time.
R:  Yeah, it is a lot of time.
L:  So ...
R:  That is a lot of time.  I -- we do a little bit of walking here.  We live in the mountains --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so we walk up the dirt road quite a bit but --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I guess I just never thought of that as exercising.
L:  Well, as I say, they seem -- they seem to be counting all of those type things as exercise these days and even, you know, sweeping the floors is exercise.  So -- so you probably do better than you think.
R:  Apparently so. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] But --
R:  I do a lot of all that stuff. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, of course that doesn't mean we couldn't use more as, you know, we get older and stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You have to work at it more.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I've notice the older that I get the more I think about those things.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And the more I'm watching what I eat --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and what I drink.
L:  Yep.
R:  I'm checking out calories and stuff like that now. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  I never used to do that. [LAUGH]
L:  Didn't used to have to.
R:  No. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] No.  Oh well, I guess that's better than the alternative, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So -- but -- so if you were take up exercise what would you want to do?
R:  Uh, you know, I think I'd like to take up bike riding again.
L:  Mm.  That probably be good in the mountains.
R:  I haven't done that in a long time.
L:  [NOISE] Yep.  Well, if you live in the mountains you'll have the pretty scenery and stuff so that'd be kinda nice --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to get out and see all that.
R:  Yeah, everything's dirt road though.
L:  Mm.
R:  Kinda hard to ride a bike on dirt roads, at least that's what my little girl tells me.
L:  Well, [NOISE] gotta get a mountain bike, you gotta get the right bike.
R:  Yeah, that's true. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] But surely there's around to go on or are they too busy?
R:  It's too busy, it's a main road.
L:  Oh.
R:  Too many tractor and trailers on it.
L:  Ooh, that's not good.
R:  No, no.  Well, it's -- I live in Christmas tree country.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, it stays pretty busy up here.
L:  Mm, okay.  Well, I know my -- my father does a lot --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of biking and off road type biking and --
R:  Oh really.
L:  -- he doesn't seem to have problem.  Yeah, but he's, you know, got a nice fancy mountain bike --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- made for that. [NOISE] So, that's one of the thing I like about karate, you know, you don't have to have all this equipment. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. Just you. [LAUGH]
L:  Yep.  You can go on vacation, you're already there, you don't have to take anything or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- find a gym or whatever.  So --
R:  So, you know, I live on a -- I live on the Appalachian trail.
L:  Mm.
R:  And, uh, [NOISE] one day, if I had the courage to do it, I'd like to walk that whole thing.  You would not believe the people that walk the who- the entire Appalachian trail.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And that things starts in, like, Maine.
L:  Uh-huh.  Wow, that's -- that's a pretty big goal there. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it is.  They say it takes months and months and months.  I just -- I don't know if I got what you need to do that. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Um --
R:  I don't know if I'm made out of that tough stuff or not. [LAUGH]
L:  Mm, I don't think I'd wanna do that.
R:  It'd be rough. [LAUGH]
L:  It'd be one of those things it'd be nice to say you did it but [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it would be pretty hard.
R:  Yeah, to actually do it that would be hard --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- 'cause I see some young kids and they walking along and they just look like they're half dead.
L:  Mm.
R:  And I think, "Oh my gosh" I mean, I've picked some of 'em up from time to time because I have a, uh, a truck --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they'll be hitchhiking so I'll pick 'em up and let 'em get in the back of the truck and bless their hearts they started in -- in Maine, you know.
L:  [LAUGH] Well --
R:  And they're just college kids and I just -- it's gotta be scary, bears and -- [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, it's -- it's gotta be fri- a frightening experience but, like you said, to be able to say that you did it would be something.
L:  Yeah.  And all that communing with nature and -- [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] No, I -- I like walking but I don't think I'd wanna -- wanna tackle that one [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, it'd be a long walk.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I know it probably wouldn't take me long at all, I'd be wishing for my vehicle. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Somebody just pick me up and take home. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I don't know how easy that would be to do though. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I'd say that'd be real hard to do.
L:  Yeah, for -- you're out in the boonies there for a while and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I was reading something the other day about, you know, somebody who's doing that and their mother was having to mail them provisions at little post offices along the way and it was like --
R:  Oh, I didn't know they did that.
L:  Well, that's wha this person was doing, I don't know what -- you know, what everybody but --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- 'cause, I mean, yeah, you can't carry all your food with you and everything --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so gotta do something like that.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's true.  I suppose there's a lot of areas like this here where there's just nowhere to even buy food.
L:  Mhm.  Yep. [NOISE]
R:  I never thought of that.
L:  Yeah, got a little -- lot of logistic things you gotta consider there.
R:  I know they look awful heavy.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Like those backpack that they're carrying are just a hundred ton, I mean --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they're just -- they're all stooped over, bless their hearts.
L:  Yeah, well that -- that's the other thing, you know, it's like it's just you walking along, you do you gotta take -- take everything with you so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yep.
R:  A lot of them even have the dogs with 'em.
L:  Oh okay.
R:  Yeah, they have them carrying backpacks too.
L:  They do? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's the cutest thing.
L:  Huh.  Well, that sounds interesting. [LAUGH]
R:  It -- oh I just love when I see somebody with a dog with them 'cause they -- oh, they got little backpacks on each side of 'em, it's just [LAUGH] -- it's just cute as it could be, the little dogs just go along. [LAUGH]
L:  Mm, become like a mule, huh? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, that does seem fair.  I think the [NOISE] dog should at least carry his own food, you know.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] So ...
R:  Yeah, I guess if he's gonna get the walk he needs to carry the grub [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just seems like that be even hard on the animal though.
L:  Yeah, I wonder if -- if they try to train them [inaudible], you know, like they probably prepare to see.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I'd say so.  Oh, some that you see they don't even have leashes on them.
L:  Yeah.  Mm, well that would help with the bear thing, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Yeah, I guess that would.  Give you a little bit of advance warning anyway.
L:  Yeah.  I think it'd be nice to have companion too, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if you're doing it by yourself at least, uh --
R:  So, you say you teach karate.
L:  Yes.
R:  Do you teach kids or adults or ...?
L:  Both.
R:  Both.
L:  Yeah, [MN] we have a small school so it's both adults and kids in the same class.
R:  Oh okay, well that must be a lot of fun.
L:  Yep.
R:  I love watching little kids do that kind of stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're so cute.
L:  It's pretty neat.  Yeah.  Yeah, we just started a -- a new session so we gotta wait and see how many people show up here. [LAUGH]
R:  Do a lot of people do it?
L:  Um, well it comes and goes ...
