R:  Hi, my name is Tony.
L:  Hi, my name's Tracey. [NOISE]
R:  Hi, Tracey, how are you doing?
L:  I'm fine.
R:  That's good.  Where are you from?
L:  I'm from West Palm Beach, Florida.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Where are you from?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Youngstown, Ohio.
L:  Oh, really, okay.
R:  Yeah, so we're in quite different areas of the country.
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  And, uh, so I guess the topic is health and fitness and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- wanting to know how much we exercise or what we exercise or if we like to exercise --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and all that stuff.
L:  Right.
R:  So, what do you, uh -- what do you do -- of course you have year round nice weather.
L:  Yeah, we do, um, well I -- I, um, have a lot of options [NOISE] I guess --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I used to exercise a lot but I got really involved in work and raising kids and stuff and I got kind of, um, away from it.  So, now I'm [LAUGH] -- it's kind of funny, I'm just starting back to an exercise program to get back in shape. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, are you?
L:  Yeah, so, I mean --
R:  And I'm kind of in the same situation, I'm, uh, extremely busy with work and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I kind of vacillate between, um, the -- getting the strong desire to do it and wanting to lose some weight.  I mean, I'm not extremely overweight, I'm probably twenty pounds overweight --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I've never been that way, but I had, uh -- about a year ago I had three surgeries within, like, two months.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I had a ruptured appendix, which turned into a hernia, which turned into, like, all these different things so --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- um, and then of course I didn't feel good for several months afterwards --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and that really -- really started my downfall, I guess.  Um, but I used to exercise regularly, I belong to a health club, I went pretty regularly and, uh, paid, like, uh, half hour on the, uh, treadmill and did some weight machines and things like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, what I have now, is I have, uh, just a treadmill in my house --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so, I mean, I have it right in my house but it's still hard to find the time to even get on it, it's unbelievable.
L:  I know, and it sits there acting like a guilt trip to you. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- and I had it in my basement --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and my basement isn't, um, um, what you call, finished --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and so I -- it just -- it's just not a pleasant place to go down to.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's not horrible but it's just not conducive to being -- wanting to go down there and especially in the winter, it was really cold down there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I said, "Okay, let me move it to the living room" because I'm -- I'm single, I don't have a family --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so I -- my living room has, like, an old couch in it, that's about it.
L:  Right, right.
R:  So, I said, "Well, it -- I don't have anything in that room, so I'll bring the treadmill up there, it'll be --"
L:  That sounds better.
R:  -- yeah --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- "I'll be more likely to use it".
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, that worked for a while but now it's still sitting there, so --
L:  [LAUGH] Well, yeah, you'll find something else, um, it sounds like it's better -- a lot warmer to move it up there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, even you could bring stuff down and decorate down there and, you know -- pretty cheap and make it look nicer just a -- a cheap, you know, sale throw rug on the floor can do wonders. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  You know, and pictures around or whatever, but I -- I know I had, um -- I -- I have, um -- I'm kind of -- where I've rai- -- had a family, I've -- I'm divorced, I've raised three kids by myself, put them through college -- [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and they've all been, um, athletes.  I've trained them how to swim from the time they were babies and, um -- [LIPSMACK] and, uh -- so they've all been in sports their whole life and ended up liking competitive swimming the best --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and so they -- I taught them how to do all that and [LAUGH] got them to school --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and so, um, they all, you know, were able to get good, you know -- into -- they all knew about nutrition and sports, you know, from the things that I taught them growing up.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, then, you know, just having three kids -- each time, you know, I gained like fifty pounds with each pregnancy, and then --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- I'd have to lose it all again, you know.  Well, you know, the doctor reckoned, you know, they just -- they tell you that, um -- that --
R:  Yeah, is that -- now is that -- that's counting the baby's weight right?
L:  Ye- yeah, I guess that would be.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That would be counting the baby's weight.
R:  But, once you have the baby you automatically lose -- well --
L:  Usually -- well, uh, yeah, but you lose like, about twenty five pounds on the -- on the delivery table and you still have a good twenty five pounds you have to lose.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, um, you have to -- you know, then you take it all off and then you have -- do the same thing which each one.  I had three kids. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's tough.
L:  And, um -- so you just get back in shape and I used to, you know -- I didn't like running, but my husband at the time was an avid runner and so just to try to -- he was a workaholic, so just to try to spend more time with him, I picked up the hobby of running and -- and joined a running club and all this, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I didn't really like it because everybody there, all they cared about was how fast they were and comparing their times and, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  It seemed like if you weren't at the front of the heap you are -- you weren't as good as anybody else. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I -- I mean -- I -- to me I'm -- I'm a dancer and a swimmer.  I mean, I love swimming and I love dancing, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so running is like a chore. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right.
L:  And so, I mean, I made a lot of friends with the people at the back of the heap and, you know, worked my way up into doing, you know -- I guess, I did lot of ten ks and then I did twenty ks and twenty five ks and, you know, I was feeling that, you know, "What am I doing, I don't even like this".
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I mean, I actually got to sort of like it but it -- I ended up doing triathlons anyway for about ten years after that and I really liked that because at least two parts of the deal I liked. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  And, um --
R:  Do you do -- do you do a lot of swimming in the ocean or is it mostly --
L:  Well, I don't do so much here now, I mean, like I say, for [SIGH] -- well -- from the time I got divorced, which was -- my -- my husband decided he didn't know what -- if he wanted to be married any more and he left around nineteen eighty eight, I guess --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- mm, and for about two years, you know, we were going through that divorce thing and ended up getting divorced in nineteen ninety and I kept running and doing triathlons all through that time and I think [NOISE] around -- I probably kept doing it 'til around ninety three, ninety four.  But, then I got in eight years of legal battle [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  As he's a lawyer -- I don't know what you do for a living, what do you do? [LAUGH]
R:  I am, uh, in the pharmaceutical industry --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I was, uh, a sales rep for, um, about eight years, but now --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- for the last three I'm a district sales manager, so I have --
L:  You're in sales?
R:  -- ten representatives under me, so I've ten headaches. [LAUGH]
L:  Do you send -- in sales.  Well, I've been in sales ever since I got back in the workforce.
R:  Okay.
L:  I was in real estate and then -- and I went -- I travel with real estate kind of as a side -- and -- and I've been a teacher --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, and at one point, um, after the divorce, I was working, like, three different jobs, you know, so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, you know, I was really pretty busy and then trying to take the kids to swim practice and get them into college and this and that.  But we -- we made it, they've all -- y- you know, the happy news is, ten years later they've all graduated. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um -- but I guess I really burned out, you know, on doing all that stuff.  You know, I just got so tire- -- I mean, I took jazzercise -- over the years I've taken jazzercise, I've done every form of exercise there is --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- to the point where I could teach it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I could probably teach it and give a class on nutrition.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And so, um, I guess around ninety five or so I went through about eight years of legal battle trying to get my MSA enforced because my ex husband is a lawyer, a board certified trial lawyer.  And so, but I stuck to it and ended up prevailing on that.  But that ended up becoming a job, you know, because after dealing with a number of different attorneys I decided to handle it myself. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  What is an MSA?
L:  A marital settlement agreement.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Uh, you know, uh, because he's a lawyer, because he knew all the tricks and whatever, eventually he just tried to get out of everything that he had agreed to.
R:  Okay.
L:  Even though seven eighths of it was for his kids [NOISE] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it didn't matter, he just didn't want to pay.  So, I had to -- I just -- I have a real issue with fairness, so I -- I just decided to make him pay by having the judge tell him he had to. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And even the state of Florida helped me with that one too --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for part of it and the child support part, the State of Florida helped me so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, that was the -- that was like another job, you know, and --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- it is the exercise, getting back to that, just -- it was just, you know, working two, three jobs, you know, handling, you know, the -- the lawyers and then eventually handling my case myself and getting these kids in school and through school and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it was just a lot --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, um, you know, the exercising ended up just taking a back seat to everything.  I was so tired that I could hardly go out for a walk, you know.
R:  Well, yeah, I understand it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because you have a full day, you get home, you got -- I mean, I -- my day --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is just jammed packed and --
L:  Yeah, and you want to -- and the thing is that you want to come -- you want to -- I found out when I was exercising before that I still have the same feelings in the morning, that I didn't really want to go -- you know, ugh, I really don't want to go for a walk or a run or whatever.  I've got to do this, I've got to do that, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But the onl- -- while I -- the only way I could really get myself to exercise is to tell myself, "Okay, fine, I hear you -- I hear all this talk in your head about how you don't want to do it, while you're doing that talk I'm going to at least put my shoes on, I'm going to get dressed [LAUGH] --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- and -- and then I'm going to stand out in the driveway and then if I still don't feel like going, then I won't".  But -- so while I was doing all this, you know, self talk, you know, I just got ready to go as if I was going and next thing I knew I was standing in the driveway ready to go.  So, I figured well I may as well go for a jog or go for a walk --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- 'cause here I am ready.
R:  Right, right.
L:  And the -- and -- and the only way I could get it done is if I did it first thing in the morning because by the time I'd try to do it when I come back, it just doesn't work, I'm too tired, I really can't overcome that.
R:  I find that it -- to be true, uh -- almost exactly true when I would do these things in the morning and then I had it all done I felt so good because I thought, "Ah, I don't have to do it now, it's done --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, with my job, I have to travel to a lot of areas that require an hour and a half, two hours drive, so I'm getting up --
L:  Oh, really.
R:  -- already at six.  So, to get up at five --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- it's -- I just can't do it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I just can't do it and I can't -- I don't get enough sleep, I mean, here it is ten thirty, I probably have another hour and hal- -- and half before I'm --
L:  You do?
R:  -- going to go to bed.
L:  I just got home that's why I put this late time, I just got home from work.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Everyone else leaves at six o'clock. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, but I -- you know in order --
