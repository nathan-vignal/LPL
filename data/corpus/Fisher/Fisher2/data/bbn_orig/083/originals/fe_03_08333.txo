R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  H- h-
R:  My name's Deborah.
L:  Hi, Deborah, I'm Bridget.
R:  Hi, uh, I guess we're supposed to be talking about fitness now, huh?
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  Oh, it's a good topic.
R:  Um, well, uh, I don't work out right now, I used to work out, um, quite extensively in the past, I was actually a aer- an aerobics instructor --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- many, many years ago.  Um, and now I'm just not motivated to get into a gym to work out.
L:  Okay.
R:  But the few times that I do I feel that once I get fifteen minutes of working out in I wanna keep working out more --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but as you're getting to start that's very difficult.
L:  Right, that was the same with me because I was a dancer [NOISE].
R:  Oh wow.
L:  So, right, I was a dancer and I, um -- and I taught a little bit and I [inaudible] for the church but I haven't danced in about a year or so, maybe about a year and I keep saying I'm gonna go back class, I'm gonna go back to class and I cannot make it.
R:  Mm.
L:  And I used to do it all the time.  Of course, I -- you know, I got paid for it as well.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  And then after I had my son is when I started, he's eleven now, becoming --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- less and less and now he's the one that works out and takes dancing --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- plays little league and all that so I'm just, you know, toting him around. [LAUGH]
R:  Ye- oh, gosh, well that's --
L:  Sometimes I work out --
R:  -- exercise, right? [LAUGH]
L:  -- with the little league when I haven't exercised, I exercise with them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I will get about five or ten minutes maybe twice a week.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's not bad.  That's not bad.
L:  Right, I'm sneaking that in.
R:  That's good. [LAUGH] Well, I try to do walking.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Now, I -- I try to walk at least thirty minutes a day outside but it doesn't always work out that way.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  An- and it's been pretty humid and hot lately so --
L:  And here it's been raining every day.
R:  Really?
L:  I'm in Chicago.
R:  You're in Chicago, oh I'm in New York. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] They've been having thunderstorms and really bad thunderstorms and -- um, every day for seven days in a row.
R:  Wow.
L:  But not where I -- I -- we just get a lot of rain where I am.  So, I'm -- I'm just, like, really blessed.
R:  Yeah, that's good.
L:  [MN]
R:  We have rain today but we just finished a heatwave.  So, it -- it's been so humid it's -- you don't even wanna step outside --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- to even walk.  And then the thought of going to the gym, it's like -- I don't have a car right now and so -- [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  -- to get to the gym it's at least a fifteen to twenty minute walk.
L:  Oh, at least you exercise there and exercise back. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, but -- [LAUGH]
L:  And I don't --
R:  I'm not --
L:  -- really have excuse because I can take classes free 'cause I still work in the dance center on Monday night.
R:  Yeah, what is your excuse [LAUGH].
L:  Because in -- uh, when I'm there is really when I could be taking class then other days of the week there's always something else to do.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, you run into this and then if you have a free day you beat[?].
R:  Right.
L:  It's just not getting there, it's just -- I almost made it Tuesday.  I almost made it but instead I washed the clothes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Yeah, I'm doing laundry now as we speak, so -- [LAUGH]
L:  But I really do wanna get back.  I have the new shoes, I -- you know, I'm ready.
R:  Yeah, what -- what --
L:  I have in my sights.
R:  What type of dance do you do?
L:  I do jazz and, um, ballet.
R:  Oh, that's exciting.
L:  I used to do tap.  I still like tap.  And --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, those types.
R:  That's great.  Yeah --
L:  And every now and then actually I will stretch at home sometimes, every now and then --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I will do some crunches or warm up --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- a little bit.  But not like I should.
R:  Yeah, I do that, uh -- yeah, I do that at home every once in a while too, like, I'll throw out my yoga mat --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I'll start to do it but it -- with yoga it's not the same if -- if you're not in a group --
L:  Right.
R:  -- f- for me personally I need the group energy.
L:  Right.
R:  But I'll do some stretching and stuff but I feel like I really do need, like, group energy --
L:  To be in a class.  'Cause you can have videos but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- then they have the same thing over and over.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Right, it gets pretty boring after a while.
R:  Yeah.  But --
L:  'Cause I've done the Tai Bo, I've done abs of -- abs of steel, I've done [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh man.
L:  -- and there's another one I have and, you know, I do those and then -- oh, the step aerobics.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I do all those but then, y- you know, I make up my own but after a while, like you say, you need the people contact.
R:  Yeah, you do.
L:  Or you gotta go out and, you know, it's only twenty dollars to go to the park district for like three months --
R:  Right.
L:  -- going any time you want to and I don't like machines too much.  I'm not into that --
R:  Yeah, me either.
L:  -- type of thing.  I like -- because theirs is more creative, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- just exercise then you also put together a routine --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I find that more creative to me --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- than just pl- plain aerobics.  Although aerobics can be fun, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I -- I kinda taught those too. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I stick to the classes myself too 'cause when I go into the gym I get very intimidated 'cause the ones near me that I can actually go to, I belong to Bally's and I got to any Bally's, but the ones that are close to me when I walk in there I'm still intimidated because there are all these men there --
L:  Everybody's so -- so little --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- and in shape.
R:  -- it's not even, like, so little and then, like, there's just a lot of guys too with all the muscles --
L:  Oh okay.
R:  -- like the Arnold Schwarzenegger guys walking around --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and they -- since they started doing personal training --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- well, it's been like a few years now --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it was like the big thing for -- sign up for personal training.
L:  [NOISE] Right, right. [NOISE]
R:  They got rid of the machines that I used to like that were computerized.
L:  Oh, okay, right.
R:  So, it was easy so I could just sit and the machine -- and like  -- you -- you had a little diagram of how to use it and then it -- it counted the reps for you and --
L:  But I thought --
R:  -- it told you if didn't [inaudible].
L:  -- some of the gyms still have that.
R:  I can't find one.
L:  Even with the personal trainers.  'Cause I know I went to one, you know, they had a free day where you could go and test it out --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and we worked with a pr- pr- um, p- a professional trainer, me and my girlfriend --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and he put us on the machine where it counted for you and everything, then he'd --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- come back and then he would do some stuff with us so -- well at that gym you could do either or.
R:  Right.
L:  Either with a personal trainer or by yourself.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Or they can get you started --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and after a while you might not need 'em anymore.
R:  Right.
L:  Mm --
R:  Oh man --
L:  -- that's interesting.
R:  Yeah, like the last time I was in a gym actually I was using one machine 'cause they changed it all, I think it's Nautilus and stuff where you have to --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- pretty much know how to use the machines. [LAUGH]
L:  Right [LAUGH].
R:  And I was sitting on the machine backward --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- and I didn't realize it and so this guy was, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- giggling and I was, like, "Oh, why you laughing at me?"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And he was like, "You gotta turn around, you're sitting backward" I was like, "Oh".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But it [LAUGH] -- so, like that ended that so then I was just like, you know, I'm just gonna stick to the classes.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Then they're so crowded but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- who knows, maybe I should try, like, dance, um, but even that's intimidating too.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  'Cause I took a hip hop class --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- it works actually, yeah, it was so --
L:  You're really daring, I don't even take those. [LAUGH]
R:  See it's so hard and then my brother told me -- he was like, "Are you sure you're gonna sign up for this?" and I was like --
L:  Well, that could be fun --
R:  -- "Yeah" I'm like --
L:  -- you never know.
R:  -- "It says beginners.  It said beginners". [LAUGH]
L:  You know, right, right, start out slow and there'll be other beginners in there with you because we have a beginning hip hop tonight at work.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I see people coming in there having no clue. [LAUGH] But they like it.  Now, if they was to come --
R:  It was a lot of fu- --
L:  -- on the other nights they would never make it [MN] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because they go really fast.  Because I've seen those.
R:  They go fast and they spin and it's like you're not used to sort of be in the positions, like she kept telling us, you know, we have to slouch, you know --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and it was funny because there were a lot of, um, dancers that were good ballerinas --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and they're -- I guess they're so used to standing up straight --
L:  Standing rigid.
R:  -- and making them -- yeah, and she kept yelling at them.  So, I actually felt --
L:  Right.
R:  -- pretty good because she was yelling at them more than me.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 'Cause she kept saying, "You gotta slouch.  Put your heads down".
L:  They were too -- they had too much technique, you have to kind let it go.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  It was fun though.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  But, I mean, it was very hard, very hard.
L:  Yeah, well I see -- I guess, because I don't mind going to the dancing because I've -- I've been there for years.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And -- and I know all the teachers and I know all the people so I kinda know what classes I wanna take.
R:  Right.
L:  So, you don't get as intimidated.  In fact, I felt better after I got older and I was bigger than when I was younger and skinnier. [LAUGH]
R:  How's that?
L:  Then you're like self conscious -- more self conscious when you're younger that you still look right --
R:  Oh right, right.
L:  -- and you're in still in shape and that you've got all the steps and you don't look like a dork but when you're older and you're not trying to be a dancer it's, like, "Hey, I'm just going to have fun".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And I found myself more relaxed and it seemed like I got -- or caught onto everything faster.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause maybe that mind thing wasn't there [NOISE] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, making me afraid 'cause now I'm really afraid, I'm just like, whatever.
R:  That's great.
L:  You know, okay, I'm bigger [NOISE], I can't do anything about that [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- don't have to worry about it. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] As long as you're healthy --
L:  And when I get smaller then I'll look -- people'll be like, "Oh, oh, you look really good".
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you know, instead of trying to stay where I already am --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it was just so different after I had my son as -- when I went back it was so different.  When I first went back I was still in shape.
R:  Right.
L:  Because -- and in effect I went back down to a six.
R:  Okay.
L:  Even though I used to wear four but a six is fine.  I was wea- I was fitting my sixes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um -- and then after that the weight was coming on slowly and then all of sudden, boom [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, you're working every day, you're in a office and you're not exercising --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and there comes a point you're -- [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- all of a sudden you're looking around and it's like, "Okay, I can't even wear the clothes I bought last year, something's got to give".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Because those were big [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Oh man.
L:  Oh gosh, it's kind of -- yeah, I won't say depressing but it's a good feeling when you do lose weight even if it's a little bit and no one else can tell and your clothes fit looser.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] I feel better.
R:  Yeah, true.
L:  So, even if I cut back -- and, you know, cut back on some of the things I eat --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a long[?] -- and not necessarily dieting but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I know I gotta get the exercise in there and that's where it'll come in is when you exercise you really don't have to worry about what you eat as much, at least for me.
R:  Right.  I have a hard time dieting.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, I can't diet.  It's just like it- it's om- --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's like telling me, like, you know, don't pee anymore or something like that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- l- like I could do it --
L:  Then you did opposite.
R:  -- it's I can't restrict myself like that --
L:  And -- and don't --
R:  -- so it's, like, I have to --
L:  -- and I -- right. [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, try other ways to, like, burn it off and stuff.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And it's amazing because when you do start exercising you eat more of the right ...
