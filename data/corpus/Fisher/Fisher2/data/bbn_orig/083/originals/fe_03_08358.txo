L:  Um, hi, I'm Sinesia fr- uh, and I live in Michigan.
R:  Hello, I'm Laurie and I live in Delaware.
L:  Oh okay.  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I -- I do, um, workout and I haven't in, like -- since I've had my baby but I did, um, before I had her and I'm actually going to hopefully be working at, um, one of our local gyms.
R:  Okay.  I happen to -- I belong to one of the local gyms --
L:  Oh okay.
R:  -- but I never have time to get there.
L:  [LAUGH] You know, that's funny because my husband and I w- um, we had -- we have gotten so many gym memberships and -- and they end up going to waste because we just can't get there. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that is -- that's actually my problem because my son goes to a gym.  He does Tae Kwon Do --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and I thought, "Okay, I'll take him and the hour that he's in class --"
L:  Okay.
R:  "-- I'll -- I'll do, you know, exercise and the weight machines and whatnot".
L:  Right.
R:  It's not happening that way because he got his drivers licence so I'm not going to the gym. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh okay.
R:  However, uh, I do go out walking with my friend next door.
L:  Okay.
R:  'Cause we're both slightly overweight so we decided well best thing to do is go out, walk about the block, walk around --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the neighborhood and try but we're not very -- really very, very, very pers- consistent with it.
L:  Okay.  Um, I walk my daughter in the -- her stroller and we have a dog which she definitely needs exercise because we found out that she's overweight [LAUGH] so her --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- her vet put her on a diet so I try really hard to walk her regularly, um, with my daughter at night when it cools off, um, we try to go out and take at least, like, a half an hour walk if nothing more, um, and I'm sure, as you know with your son being older now, you get [NOISE] a lot of exercise with little ones.  Um, you know, you're constantly running around and chasing them when they're small and doing things with them so -- you know, and carrying them.  I really feel like the difference in my biceps and stuff and I know that's just from when I wo- used to work out on a regular basis.  That my biceps get such a work out from carrying my daughter around 'cause she's pretty heavy. [LAUGH] Um --
R:  Oh -- oh I can imagine that. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, so, um, you know, and -- and my goal is, like you said you and your friend are -- you know, you're trying -- you're at least trying and that's my goal to at least try to, you know, be healthy.  You know, I eat -- we eat very healthy.  Um, I cook extremely healthy, um, and when we go out for dinner is when we kinda splurge.  So, um, the goal, the want, the drive is -- you know, it's -- all that's there it's just the time and the motivation of actually doing it. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh yes.  Well, we don't -- I cook very -- well, I cook healthy --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I tend to not, um, cook, you know, a lot of fried stuff --
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  -- but my husband does most of the cooking because I'm -- have a very strange work schedule.
L:  Oh okay.
R:  I work as a court interpreter so I'm out of the house a lot.
L:  Okay.
R:  And he loves fried food.  
L:  [NOISE] Oh okay.
R:  So, you try to explain to him, "No, dear, I -- you know, I've got -- I'm -- I'm working out, you may not be but I'm, you know, working out --"
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  "-- and you do fried foods and it just doesn't work the same".
L:  Right, right, yeah, and, uh, and I grew up actually eating a lot of fried foods and then when I went off to college and, you know, I just was like got used --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of course living in the dorm the first few years, got used to eating the food they cooked which was not very much fried food --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and then just being on my own and being married I got -- you know, started doing a lot of things sauteed and, um, grilled and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- stuff like that and so -- and then my husband was big into working out so that helped, you know, we're both trying to motivate each other to get back into the gym and everything and so -- but I know -- I -- I understand your husband about the fried food because some days I just -- you know, I could probably sit and eat, like, fried fish, french fries, fried shrimp [LAUGH] --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and then you just feel so heavy and bad and guilty though after you eat it. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it's -- no that's true.  Um, what, uh, what I did do when I was at the gym was like weightlifting --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and I -- have you -- you've done weightlifting before?
L:  Yes, yes, my husband actually used to, um, do -- uh, he was personal trainer and he -- he's actually set diet plans and things like that for friends of ours, um, and that -- that was one of his biggest things.  We have weights in our house actually and a Bowflex and stuff like that.
R:  Okay, now I -- I have a question.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I started doing that but I have --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- carpel synd- um, carpel tunnel syndrome.
L:  Carpel tunnel, okay, okay.
R:  And it really -- sometimes it really, really bothers me.  I feel great afterwards --
L:  Okay, okay.
R:  -- but I didn't know -- you know, weight there and the person that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm supposed to talk to at the gym is never there at the hours I go.
L:  Okay.
R:  So --
L:  If I were -- do you wrap your wrists before you work out?
R:  No, I don't.
L:  That -- you need to wrap 'em.
R:  Okay.
L:  If you wrap your wrists with either like a, um, you know, the kinda -- the, um, Ace bandage makes one that you can kind of put on almost like a glove.
R:  Yeah, I've seen those.
L:  You can -- you -- you can do those or you can just get the Ace bandage wrap and wrap that around, um, that will give you support and then that way you're not doing, like, a four hundred percent strength on your wrist when you're doing -- when you're lifting weights and I bet you'll see a huge difference, um, when -- you know, when -- uh, after you work out.  You won't feel as much pain or achiness or anything like that 'cause that will help support, it'll help you when you're lifting.
R:  Okay, that's great.  Thanks the -- the -- the information 'cause --
L:  Yeah, yeah, you should try that, that'll definitely help, um, and I don't know -- I'm sure the person that you're trainer or whoever has probably told you too that lifting weights you will put on -- you'll gain weight, you know, because you're putting on muscle, and so y- you'll gain weight before you lose weight because you're toning everything up and it's turning into muscle.
R:  Yeah, no, that -- that I did know.
L:  Okay, okay.
R:  I'm the -- I'm the sort of person that has, um -- I'm slightly overweight and since I moved back to United States I'm even more overweight because you don't walk as much here.  At least --
L:  No, you don't.
R:  And not in Delaware.  Uh, in Delaware everything is in a car, even to go to the gym I have to go in a car and I feel, "Okay, this is really stupid.  I have to go twenty minutes in a car to get to the gym to work out".
L:  Right.
R:  But, um, you have to because that's -- that's where the neighborhood gym is, twenty minutes away.
L:  Right.  Oh, I know.  We lived in Virginia and that was the same way.  You have to drive everywhere, um, there's no walking.  I mean, and -- and honestly there's really no walking unless you live, like, in a -- in a decent inner city area that you really can't walk anyway to get anyway you just -- you have to drive everywhere and, you're right, it doesn't help -- it doesn't help when you're trying to be healthy --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and trying to stay fit because the roads aren't made anymore for you to -- to bike ride where you need to go which is a great work out, um --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- but you can't -- I mean, really it's not safe [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's just not safe to ride a bike.  I would be terrified, uh, you know, I mean, on trails, yes, that's great --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I -- and my husband keeps saying, you know, "When are we gonna get bikes, when are we gonna get bikes to ride on trails" and I'm like, "When we get room to store them". [LAUGH] You know, because it's, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, I don't want 'em sitting out in the living room --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [NOISE] um, um, but I -- I totally understand what you mean about not -- you know, having to drive everywhere, it doesn't help because, you know, it would be nice that if you could walk to the gym, do your work out --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then cool down and walk home, you know --
R:  Great, uh, great, great, great.
L:  Yeah, it would be nice.
R:  But it just doesn't work that way.
L:  No, it doesn't and I've been to Delaware before because my, um, in laws lived there and so I know how you have to drive and you -- uh, you do, you have to drive everywhere to get anywhere in Delaware so -- [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I -- I can totally understand and we actually live more out, um, not like country area but we live -- we're liv- we live more out where things are starting to be developed so --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- you know, you definitely -- you have to drive where -- anywhere you got but I'm in a mommy's group, um, and so we get together quite a bit and a lot of the moms were getting together to, like, to do what you and your girlfriend, um, have started doing.  They have gotten together and started walking in the malls, I don't know if they do it in Delaware but, um, they open up the malls, like, a couple of hours early or something like that for you to go and just walk around, it's all --
R:  I haven't heard about that yet.
L:  Okay, well they do it here.  I know they did it in Virginia too, a lot of the malls, um, a lot of the -- it's really in the winter time, they open up really early and you can just go, none of the stores are open, um, but the doors to the mall are open and you can go and you can just walk around and walk aroun- you'll be surprised how many people are in the malls walking around.  It -- I mean, it's a lot and they have little things that tell you how many laps are in the mall and everything and you see all the moms there pushing the kids in the strollers, um, and it's just all different age groups and everyone there just, you know, getting there and doing their laps and everything.
R:  Well, I --
L:  So, that's another thing.
R:  Yeah, I -- there is a mall near here that's only five minutes away --
L:  Oh okay.
R:  -- but I haven't -- um, the times that I've been there for teenage shopping I haven't seen any signs or anything about laps or about exercise or anything else.
L:  [NOISE] Oh okay.
R:  So, they --
L:  You --
R:  -- probably don't have that.
L:  -- or you can -- you know what, you might wanna check at the information desk at the mall, um, because I know I've never seen anything, um, advertised about it, I just knew that, you know, that they offered that option that you could do that.
R:  Okay, that -- that's a good idea too.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Um, and then it's -- you know, you have a support system that's the other thing that helps with fitness.
R:  Oh yes, that -- that I have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I have realized, it's not --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, it's more of a support thing than --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- people bugging you to do things.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Which is what I have.  I have people bug me.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You've gotta do this and you've gotta do that.  And I say, "Okay, well instead of bugging me, let's work on it together" and it's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so- somehow just doesn't seem to work that way. [MN]
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  So --
L:  No, she wants it.  
R:  Pardon.
L:  Oh, I'm sorry I was reaching -- I was just reaching for something for my daughter.
R:  Oh okay. [LAUGH]
L:  Um, it -- it does help when you have people supporting you, like, I know from my husband, um, he can't eat -- like he can't have a lot of junk food around the house and I have to tell you I grew up where we had a cabinet that was -- that was solely dedicated to junk food in my house.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And so it was hard when we got married ...
