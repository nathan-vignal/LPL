R:  [MN]
L:  Crystal.
R:  [MN]  Sheila.  [PAUSE]  Hi.  [LAUGH]
L:  Hi!
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Um, they said the topic was exercise.  [SIGH]
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay.  I do exercise.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  I haven't done so [NOISE] in the past month but when I've ... done it, um, I usually only do it, like, three to five times a week.  And [SIGH] most of -- most of the exercises I would do with Taebo.  I like Taebo and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- firm and I would mix, um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Taebo and a firm up on certain days.
R:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
L:  'Cause I like, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, Taebo for the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for the exercise, you know, [SIGH] and, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the firm was -- was -- were with weights.
R:  [NOISE]  U- u- um, I haven't exercised m- much lately.  [SIGH]  I'm, ah, [LAUGH] -- a- -- a- -- ah, six months pregnant so [NOISE] --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- for me -- for me it's walking but [SIGH] I used to exercise.  I l- liked kick boxing which is pretty much just a rip off of ... Taebo.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  But, um, -- I mean but what -- what did she say though?  That you don't -- I mean, [SIGH] would you like to?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I guess that's what the thing was?  [SIGH]  So, you c- can't because you're pregnant.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But you are exercising --
R:  [SIGH]  I can't do much.
L:  -- and, ah, you might as well say you are exercising --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- 'cause you're walking.
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
L:  How many times a week do you walk?
R:  [SIGH]  U- um, well my kids ... w- want to walk every day so p- pretty [LAUGH] much every day.  Not always but as ... close to it as possible.  [NOISE]
L:  Okay, so how long --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is it?  What twenty --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- minutes, half hours ... hour?
R:  [NOISE]  Oh, I don't know.  Um, [LAUGH] [SIGH] on a good day it's, ah, -- it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- about an hour but sometimes it's just fifteen minutes, a- and every once in a while it's just around the block.
L:  Okay.  Right I think it's beneficial.  U- um, me -- my main thing -- my main purpose of exercise is to lose weight.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Like I said the past month I haven't been, um, doing it because I've been running around.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  You know back and forth running errands but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I know that it helps me out as far as, um, ... my ... body image, like, as far as, um, shape wise [SIGH] because I know when I don't exercise I seem kind of flabby [LAUGH] in areas.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  And when I do I feel good about myself.  I have more energy.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And it's, -- you know, I feel it's good for health reasons, y- you know, also for weight, you know, main- +maintenance ... or reason.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [MN]  'Cause I'm kind of diet- -- I'm dieting right now.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, as far as, um, ... [SIGH]--
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- helping me to [SIGH] keep up with the goals as far as losing weight is -- it has been helping.  If it wasn't for this -- this past month -- [SIGH] I see I gained a few pounds because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I wasn't exercising, you know?
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  Because it burns a lot more -- you know, if you exercise it burns a lot more calories than if you're not doing anything [SIGH] but driving --
R:  Right.
L:  -- around back and forth, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- y- you know.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  So, that's what's h- helped me 'cause I, -- you know, I have a healthy eating, -- you know, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a good healthy eating habit.  But exercising, you know, I know burns a lot of calories.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I know Taebo burns, what?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Ah, close to w- what, eight hundred or so calories --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a hour?
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  And, ah, you know with the firm, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I figure --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's more or less like, -- you know 'cause, um, most of them will burn, ah, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- burns, ah, you know fat also, right?
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.  [NOISE] 
L:  So, by doing that, exercising and doing that on top of it, it h- helped me out a lot, 'cause I like seeing the way that, you know, my body's firming up or shaping.  [SIGH]  And that keeps -- that gets me motivated to, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, to keep doing it.
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, I've noticed -- this is the first pregnancy where I haven't been ... really active [NOISE] the whole time through, and [NOISE] I've definitely noticed a difference.  [SIGH]  I don't have as much e- energy ...  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, 'cause I've done it, like, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- well, shush, I'm an on and off exercise thing --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I mean, [SIGH] at one point [NOISE] I was -- I had -- went -- you can get hooked on exercise too, you know?
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
L:  [LAUGH]  Just like with --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- everything else ... [SIGH] 'cause, like, one point after --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- after I h- had my -- my daughter --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- she -- she's nine now --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] but, ah, right after --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I had her, um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I started exercising, like, from the time -- she was, like, about two months -- I started exercising like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] then it was like -- I -- I was into step classes an- [LAUGH] and step, you know, the tape, you know, the steps?
R:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
L:  You know I was exercising on it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, ah, t- that would run [NOISE] for, like, about a hour.  [SIGH]  Then I'd do weights --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for a hour.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And then, you know, I'd jog, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, and then --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it -- it would be, like, close to t- two and a half --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- hours sometimes I would -- I would [NOISE] put aside in a day because I was home --
R:  Right.  [NOISE]
L:  -- and exercising.  [NOISE]  [PAUSE]
R:  So, you do all --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you do all of your e- exercising at home?  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, most -- yes, I do it at home.  I was, ah, [NOISE] like when I was working, ah, -- it was -- there was one job I was working at Price Waterhouse, um, [SIGH] they had, a- ah, you know, like when you have the -- when you were able to go to the gym?
R:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
L:  You know they pay for you to go to the gym and all that.  [PAUSE]
R:  That's a good deal.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, and I did -- I did that for -- for a while, you know, but then I wasn't a- as motivated.  [SIGH]  You know I would go, [SIGH] you know, when I had a chance after work I'd go maybe three times, you know [NOISE] and, you know, [NOISE] watch everybody else do whatever and seem, like, I'm competing with [LAUGH] -- with [SIGH] other people I would go with, you know, --
R:  [NOISE]  R- right.
L:  -- just to see how long we hang in there.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But I'm -- I'm more of the type that likes exercising by herself.  [NOISE]  I can do it by myself.  I enjoy it.  [NOISE]  I can dress anyway I want, you know.
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  I can exercise any -- any time of the day, [NOISE] you know, like, you know when I'm home -- any time I [NOISE] l- like too, you know have -- have a set time where I can go.  [NOISE]  You know when -- you know when I wanted to -- when I want to do it.  [NOISE]  If I want to exercise at five in the morning I can do it.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  Or eight o'clock [NOISE] at night, you know.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And then I don't have to worry about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, like, have -- you know heck I mean, "Maybe I should put this outfit on" or something like that.  You know I can just ... dress any way I want to.  [NOISE]  I'm in my house.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Y- yeah.  And you can -- [NOISE] you don't have to worry about somebody watching the kids.  Or ...
L:  Exactly.
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  'Cause, like I said, when my daughter was, y- you know, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- two months, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- she was -- she would be sitting there looking at -- [LAUGH] --
R:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
L:  -- looking at me -- watching me.  A l- little baby watching me [SIGH] exercise and she would be quiet.  She'd be watching her mummy e- [LAUGH] exercise.  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It was amusing her --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [LAUGH] to see me work out, you know?
R:  [SIGH]  Did she ever ... g- get up and try to do any of it with you?  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, later on when she got a little older, yeah.
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
L:  But, at two months, no.  [LAUGH]
R:  No, not -- not at two months.  [LAUGH]
L:  But later on, yeah.  [SIGH]  Later on she --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- 'cause she was -- she was excited.  She was happy at me --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- instead of, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, like, um, [SIGH] you know, most babies, you know, they -- they try to occupy, you know, when they're --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- t- that small --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know try to find something, you know, like they'll play a little look around and stuff.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  She was staring at me.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  And I guess it looked silly to her for me bouncing up and down [NOISE] or [LAUGH] -- or something --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- going up and down [SIGH] but she'd be quiet.
R:  Right, you know.
L:  She wouldn't holler --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- she wouldn't holler or anything.  She -- she'd be quiet.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It amused her.  So, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I didn't have to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- worry about anything.
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah, --
L:  Like I said --
R:  -- my boy --
L:  -- huh?
R:  Sorry, go ahead.  [SIGH]
L:  But, um, like I s- [LAUGH] said [LAUGH] -- like, I was saying before --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- [SIGH] when you -- when you stop [NOISE] exercising --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and when you, -- you know, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when you stop doing it --
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
L:  -- like you say, you notice a difference.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I do too and, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- yeah, I gain weight [NOISE] faster --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like that.  [SIGH]  And you get kind of lazy.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  'Cause you -- you can stop quite easily.  [NOISE]  If you stop the first week, like, I -- I'm in a slump now.  [NOISE]  It's been a month.
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah, once you get --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] past, like, t- three days, [SIGH] if you go three whole days without working out that's it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-hum.  You can -- it's easy for you to get --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- into that slump and then you've got to push -- m- motivate yourself to get back, and then it may take about two weeks before you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- really get in the swing again.
R:  [NOISE]  Yep.
L:  That's the down side.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But, ah, [NOISE] your stomach hurt?  [NOISE]  Oh!
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, but that's what, um, I enjoy though.  [NOISE]  Th- those are the two exercises --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I like best are Taebo and the ... f- firm.
R:  [NOISE]  My sister does Taebo.  I -- I -- like I said I did the kick boxing [NOISE] [SIGH] and I used to r- run.  [SIGH]  I can't do that any more.  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  What -- were you, like, with o- other people or you like doing it by yourself?  Or you -- are you the type --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of person who likes, you know, like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- going to classes --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or, [SIGH] like --
R:  [NOISE]  Oh --
L:  -- being with a partner, [NOISE] jog with or ...? [SIGH]
R:  If it's um, ... the -- [NOISE] -- like the ... T- Taebo or t- the, [MN] ... u- um, step classes --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I prefer to do it in a class.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  'Cause I -- otherwise I'll just sit there and t- [LAUGH] take it easy.  [SIGH]  But [NOISE] running or doing weights I prefer to do 'em by myself.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  I don't know why.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Right.  I just -- I -- I don't know, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just feel it's -- to me I feel, um, ... better I think I feel a little m- more confident.  I would feel kind of uneasy --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] being around other people, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, like ... doing it I guess.  So, that's to me -- [SIGH] I'm competitive.  That's my problem.  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And like I said when -- when I -- like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when I was going to the gym, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, like and I'm working out with other people [NOISE] it's like, [SIGH] competition --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but it [NOISE] w- would probably be good for other people, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, they might like, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, ... competing like that.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know and that might --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- help ... keep them motivated 'cause some people are motivated by having somebody else out there to go with them, you know, [NOISE] --
R:  R- right.
L:  -- to exercise, and me myself -- [SIGH] I mean I know I'm competitive so [SIGH] I prefer ... just doing it, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, for myself and I've -- just push myself.  [SIGH] I can push myself ... to doing it.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's just when I, -- you know when, I stop doing it, you know, ... it's done.  I'm -- I'm finished.  [LAUGH]
R:  R- right.
L:  [SIGH]  And it takes a lot for me to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- get back.  And I [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]  Are you planning to exercise tomorrow now?  [LAUGH]
L:  Huh?
R:  Now that they've done this are you going to exercise tomorrow?  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, right.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Pretty[?] well -- [SIGH] ah, well --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] my brother's here now so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I -- I, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] maybe walk around a little bit ... but, um, I'll probably start ... on Monday.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  On Monday I'll start.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I got the tapes.
R:  Every little bit helps.
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  I got the tapes.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I think all I have to do is [NOISE] get on the scales.  That'll probably be the one to scare me back enough.  [NOISE]  Getting back out on, -- you know, start working out again, probably, tape again.
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah, all I have to do is try to put on [LIPSMACK] the pregnancy clothes I could wear at t- this stage with the other two.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And [SIGH] "Oh, okay, gotta stop eating so much and start walking some more".  [SIGH] [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Well, you do it for what?  For toning or for, I mean, 'cause you say you +run -- you run too.  Is it for, like, um, 'cause some people they run, you know maybe [SIGH] helps to clear your mind.  [PAUSE]  Is it for that?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know that benefit, you know --
