L:  Christie.
R:  Hi, I'm Ben.
L:  Hi, Ben.
R:  How are you doing?
L:  I'm fine, um, I work out occasionally.
R:  Oh, so what -- so what's occasionally mean?
L:  Uh, twice a week.
R:  Oh, all right, that's good.  Wh- and what do you do?
L:  Um, I've joined a gym so I use the treadmill, the stair steps --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and then not free weights but the machine weights.
R:  Uh-huh. [PAUSE]
L:  So, I just use --
R:  Okay, cool.
L:  -- um, do you want to know how long I use them or ...?
R:  Sure, I guess, we've got to talk for ten minutes --
L:  Um --
R:  -- about this, so it's not -- not that -- not -- not the most thought provoking question, I think --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- but ...
L:  [LAUGH] Well, you can tell me what you do?
R:  Oh, I'm not that interesting either. [LAUGH] Um, yeah, I go to the gym, I -- I run on the treadmill and then I do the free weights -- usually about -- I try to go four times a week.
L:  You're doing better than I am. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Um, yeah -- I don't know, yeah, it's important that you -- I -- I think it's a -- it -- it definitely sort of, um, makes everything -- everything in my life better when I'm -- when I'm in shape and when I'm working out regularly. [PAUSE] You too?
L:  Uh-huh, I'm sorry?
R:  You too?
L:  What you --
R:  I mean do you -- do you enjoy it or do you do it just for --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for health reasons or ...?
L:  Well, I've been -- I joined the gym, like, three months ago, so, um -- in the beginning I went four times a week --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- for the first -- for the first month and then the second month went down to three times, now on the third month I'm down to two times. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, it's hard to work out when you -- you know, when you're working --
R:  Yeah, sure.
L:  -- just to take care of the -- a- --
R:  What, uh -- what prompted you to join?
L:  Oh, to lose weight.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Is that what prompted you to do it?
R:  Um --
L:  Or just to stay in shape?
R:  Yeah, well a little of both I think.  I mean -- I mean, I -- I definitely go -- I'd sooner go in and out as being in -- in really good shape than really bad shape.  You know, like, I mean, I'll spend seven or eight months where I'm -- where I'm running almost every day and feeling great and then -- and then usually I'll stop for one reason or another and five months later I'll be you know, fat and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- disgusting and smoking cigarettes and --
L:  Yeah, I think that makes it harder to work out because --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- I'm trying to quit smoking and it -- right now it's really hard to work out when you're trying to quit, you'd think it would be harder when you did smoke --
R:  Yeah, oh so you -- you --
L:  -- but when you try and quit it's even worse. [LAUGH]
R:  So, you just -- so you -- you just quit recently then?
L:  Yeah --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- I just quit like in the last, um -- it's been, mm, a week.
R:  Oh, wow, no that's rough.
L:  Yeah, so it makes it harder to work out.
R:  Yeah, totally.  Uh, working out is great for getting you to quit smoking.
L:  Huh?
R:  Working out is -- at least for me, it's great --
L:  Oh, we- -- yeah.
R:  -- for getting me to quit smoking.
L:  Yeah, 'cause then you can -- well then you can work out longer if you -- I guess if you quit smoking you probably would be in better health to work out longer.
R:  Yeah, definitely and it -- it gets -- for me at least, when I'm smoking or working out, it -- it gets hard, I get frustrated 'cause I, you know, I can't sort of work out as hard or as long as I'd like to and -- you know, and then --
L:  Yeah, and then you have to keep -- makes you breathe that much harder and then you're ready to quit and [LAUGH] --
R:  Exactly.  Yeah, it's definitely good -- a good incentive to quit smoking, I think.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, is this -- is this the first gym you've joined or ...?
L:  Yeah.  Well, no, I take that back, it's been a couple of years but I wor- -- went to, uh -- we have, like, a YMCA --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I went -- I joined that, like, three, four years -- four years ago --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I would go to that after work, but it just got too crowded.
R:  Yeah, yeah, definitely.  Yeah, that's hard, I think -- I think working out, um, yeah --
L:  So, do y- --
R:  -- when you have a day job, working out is -- is difficult, you have to really make time for it.
L:  So, do you go to a gym or do you work out at home too?
R:  Um, right now, I go to a gym.  Um, in the past I've -- I -- I've -- I've been really into running before, um, there's a really nice park near my house, so with --
L:  Yeah, I like to go -- like, I have two dogs and I like to try and take them for a walk after I get off work --
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  -- but it's so hot right now, I mean, we're ninety degree weather, it's too hot to take them out for their walk so ...
R:  Yeah.  Where -- where are you?
L:  In Indiana.
R:  Oh, Indiana --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- oh okay, yeah.  I'm in, uh -- I'm in New York.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Um, [LIPSMACK] let's see, what else -- what else could we talk about --
L:  Um --
R:  -- something to do with exercise and everything.
L:  Have you ever had anything, like, in your house to work out with, you know, like a treadmill?
R:  Have I ever what?
L:  Have you ever bought, like, a treadmill or any of the infomercial things to use to work out with?
R:  I never have, have you?
L:  Um, I bought some of the videos before those, uh --
R:  Yeah, like aerobics videos or ...?
L:  Ye- -- well, they're the, um, one's a pilates, I don't know if you've ever seen that?
R:  Oh, pilates, uh-huh.
L:  Yeah, I tried -- oh, those are hard. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, are they? [LAUGH]
L:  They make them seem -- they make them seem so easy on TV but they're really, really hard to do.
R:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
L:  I tried to --
R:  Yeah, they look pretty hard.
L:  I don't know, I think I've -- I mean, I think I would work out more if I had something at home to use 'cause you've got it right there in front of you and you don't have to worry about driving to the gym and back, so ...
R:  Uh-huh. [LIPSMACK] Yeah, that's one thing I used to, um -- yeah, I used to -- I used to be into running a lot but now I -- I actually like running on a treadmill because I can, you know, watch TV at the gym --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or whatever and, you know, watch Jeopardy or whatever while I'm -- while I'm running.  It -- it -- it actually does make it easier, I think.
L:  I think so too, that's why I'm -- that's why I thought I'd get a tread- I'm going to try and get a treadmill or something for in the house and see whether the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and stop going to the gym because it costs too much money. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh. [PAUSE] Um, [LIPSMACK] Mm --
L:  It's funny this is the topic because I had -- we had a -- a Wellness Fair at my work today.
R:  What's that?
L:  We had to, like -- a Wellness Fair, um, they have --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- like, little booths to go to for, like --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- for different companies and stuff like that.  Um, they, like, check your -- like, your weight and your cholesterol and, um, some of the hospital places, like, for lasik surgery were in there and things like that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I thought that was funny this is the topic too.
R:  Yeah.  So, how did it go for you?
L:  Um, when they had to do my body mass --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, I think it's, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- how much muscle and fat you have --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I was very disappointed when they said how much fat I said. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, no. [LAUGH]
L:  I was, like, "I guess I do need to go back to the gym", I'm like, "Okay"
R:  Uh. [LAUGH] [NOISE] Um, [NOISE] have you ever -- has there ever been a time in your life when you've been through and you've been really into it or ...?
L:  Well, I -- I can't stay motivated to go, I -- I get --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- motivated for about a month and I was --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I was going four and five times the first month --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, that's great.
L:  -- but then I get -- well --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I think it's just because when I was going at the beginning this was a smaller --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- gym and there weren't as --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- many people there --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and -- and it seems like it's picked up a lot 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- more business, so there's more people there and I don't like to work out when there's a lot of people.
R:  [NOISE] You do or you don't?
L:  I don't.
R:  Uh, 'cause it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's too, uh, distracting and --
L:  Well --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's distracting plus they don't have a -- a whole lot of equipment, so then people get on the machines you want --
R:  Oh, right.
L:  -- and stay, like, on the treadmill --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they'll stay on the treadmill for an hour, or, you know, the only ones that work out for, like, an hour anyway --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so --
R:  [NOISE] Right.  Um, did you -- did you play sports, when you were younger, at all?
L:  No, I was into swimming, I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but we didn't have a swim team where I went to school, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, before high school, in, like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I guess that would be -- what -- eighth grade, I was in track --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but then when I got to high school the only thing I did was flags.
R:  Was what?
L:  Flags with the band.  Um, the girls that have the -- twirl the flags --
R:  Oh, flags, right, okay, [NOISE] I got you.
L:  Yeah, that was -- I did that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for my freshman year in high school and then I got too involved to have anything to do with anything else [LAUGH] --
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  -- between school and --
R:  Yeah, that's not really -- that's not -- that's definitely not the most aerobic --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- um --
L:  I mean, you --
R:  -- uh --
L:  -- you had to walk --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I used to do, like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I mean, we'd do parade -- be in parades so you'd walk and twirl the flags the whole time --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you're in the parade.
R:  Yeah, actually that does, huh -- does -- that's probably really tiring?
L:  Yeah, but, I mean, it's not as aerobic as, like, football or basketball or anything like that but ...
R:  Right.  Um, yeah, 'cause I wonder if, uh -- I guess I -- I'm just wondering if, uh -- how much that has to do with how much people work out or if they did sports when they were younger and ...
L:  It could, 'cause I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I really wasn't -- I was more into hanging out with my friends and stuff like that than worrying about having sports after school.
R:  Yeah.  Um, yeah, I hear you -- I hear you on that. [LAUGH]
L:  And, I mean, I was always hear my -- I always hear people talk about dieting, make sure you diet when you're working out but that doesn't work -- for me at least. [LAUGH]
R:  No.
L:  I cannot diet.
R:  Uh-oh.
L:  I can maybe  -- I can diet at lunch, I can have a salad for lunch, but then by the time I come home I want pizza --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- or tacos or something like that, something good. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, those are good [LAUGH] that stuff's good stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That could probably --
R:  Um --
L:  -- be why [LAUGH] I need to work out more.
R:  What's that?
L:  Eating the pizza every night is probably why I need to work out more.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Yeah, definitely that's one thing I sort of -- when I -- I mean, it always takes me a long time to sort of get [NOISE] in shape, but when I do it's good 'cause, [NOISE] like, if I'm working out a lot then I can -- then I can eat whatever I want --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- pretty much, I mean, for the most part. [NOISE] Um, but, yeah, [LAUGH] it is hard to -- to turn down a delicious pizza or a --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- a -- a nice burger or something.
L:  Um --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, she -- she --
L:  We have to talk for ten minutes. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, well --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- um, all right, lets see, what -- what else can we talk about that has to do with --
L:  Um, do you --
R:  -- working out every day?
L:  -- do you still smoke?
R:  Uh, yeah, sometimes.  I probably -- I probably smoke maybe half a pack a week or something like that.
L:  Social smoker.
R:  You -- what's that?
L:  Are you a social smoker?
R:  Um, yeah, mostly.  If I -- I'm sort of --
L:  When you go out and stuff?
R:  I'm --
