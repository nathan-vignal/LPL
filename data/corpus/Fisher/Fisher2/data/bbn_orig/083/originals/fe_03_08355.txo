L:  Hello.  Hi, I'm [NOISE] Tracy.
R:  Oh, hi.  I'm Kelly.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  How are you?
L:  Good.  How are you?
R:  I'm doing all right. [NOISE]
L:  So, what --
R:  So, do you --
L:  -- do y- -- uh, go [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- go ahead. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So, do you exercise regularly?
L:  Not as regularly as I should.
R:  Right.  Um, I -- I do like five times a week. [NOISE]
L:  Well, that's good.  What do you do?
R:  Um, walking and a little -- some weight training but mostly walking.
L:  Walking.  How far do you walk?
R:  Um, 'bout five or six miles a day.
L:  Oh, wow.  All at once?
R:  Uh, yes.  All in the morning.
L:  Well, you do good. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Mine's about a mile if I do it but I walk with my five year old.
R:  Oh -- oh, well that --
L:  Trying to get him more involved.
R:  Well, that slows you down, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, you know, what can you say? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] A mile is usually about as far as we can get.
R:  Eek, right, well I can imagine because I'm sure he can't go -- or he or she, or whatever --
L:  Yeah, but --
R:  -- couldn't walk --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- er, can't go that fast.
L:  But I try to do more but it just seems like by the time you get everybody else settled down, doesn't leave much time for yourself.
R:  Right, well, I mean, I have a couple of dogs and you know, I take one at a time --
L:  And [LAUGH] --
R:  -- and they --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- they pull me along, it motivates me [LAUGH].  They keep it going at a quick pace too.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So -- and I also do like s- -- um, some weight training --
L:  What --
R:  -- also but not as -- as heavily as I used to when I was younger. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I know, it kind of seems to slow down as we get older. [LAUGH]
R:  Ew, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well [LAUGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't know why that is but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Aye, it's just happened to me.  I just -- is -- I'm less motivated, I guess.  I don't know.  I guess, it -- and maybe it depends on your situation in life too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, I guess, uh, [SIGH] well, I don't know what -- was it -- is diet part of that?  I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well, it could be in healthy.
R:  I think so.  I mean, it's probably part of health and fitness, isn't it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, do you have -- do you have a good diet?  Do you eat good?
L:  That I do.  I do make sure the fruits and vegetables and the water and ...
R:  That's -- where are you calling from?
L:  Michigan.
R:  Okay [LAUGH].  Just curious.
L:  Yeah, that's okay.  Where are you?
R:  I'm in, uh, California.
L:  Oh, so you got warmness all year round, which helps too.
R:  That's true.  And it --
L:  In the winter, it's a little hard to get out and walk here. [LAUGH]
R:  That -- that -- I believe it.  That's [LAUGH] right.  I can understand --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, it's -- it's very hot here though.  It's -- it's like it's been over, um -- over a hundred every day.
L:  Oh, that doesn't make it any easier then.
R:  Um, y- yeah, yeah, that's -- that's why I do it as early in the morning as possible.  I mean, in -- in the last couple of nights, it's been -- it's gotten down to sixty five.
L:  Well, that's comfortable though.
R:  But overnight though, that's [LAUGH] -- that's the --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- lowest it gets. [LAUGH]
L:  Not in the daytime, huh. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  But anyway, I'm -- I'm -- I'm a vegetarian, so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I -- I stay in pretty good shape --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- so ...
L:  And that helps.
R:  Er, yeah, that helps --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- along with the walking and everything. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, for my age, which I -- I think, um, I'm in better shape than a lot of people my age but --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- I mean, I don't know.  For most of the people that I've seen my age, they, uh -- they can't believe that, uh --
L:  They -- they can't --
R:  -- that I'm not fat. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] To put it mildly. [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] [NOISE]
R:  But ...
L:  Well, there [NOISE] -- yeah, I know it's [NOISE] -- that's everybody's thing to stay -- nowadays, the biggest push for the health, so --
R:  Yeah, well, it should be.  I mean, there are so many kids out there that are just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  In couch -- staying that -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- staying inside.  That's all -- just to get mine out and moving --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- even though we don't make it that far, it gives --
R:  Right.
L:  -- them something to do, to not be sitting in the house in front of the TV.
R:  Er, well, you know and that's what I -- that's why I think most kids are because I remember when I was a kid, I ate very badly too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, uh, in most of the -- and all of the kids did when I was -- I mean, [LAUGH] I don't know, I'm not that old but I'm, you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I'm -- I'm forty five okay.
L:  Well, that's not old. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, okay.  But when I -- when I was young, we ate like really bad.  But there was hardly anybody fat.
L:  Right.  'Cause you were --
R:  We --
L:  -- outside, you didn't have all the video games and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- computer games [NOISE] and ...
R:  That's -- that's exactly right.  So, I think it's more that than the food and they're -- they're focusing on the wrong thing.
L:  And now, with both parents having to work more, it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the convenience foods, which are higher in the fat and then the kids don't get out moving.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, that -- I mean, I ate those too.  Uh, you know, McDonalds, I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's the -- Kentucky Fried Chicken and all that, when I was younger but I'm -- you know, when the kids got out of school, we didn't go and sit in front of a computer though.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  We -- we went outside and we were playing outside until the street lights came on and that's the way it was every day, so [LAUGH] ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think that's why kids are getting -- that's why that's a problem --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- mostly.
L:  -- it's not so much of diet as the lack of --
R:  I think so --
L:  -- exercise.
R:  I think so.  Because there's, uh, you know, all those bad foods give you a lot of energy too. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] They do.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] All that sugar and all that, you go hyper, man.
L:  You should be out --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- be able to move, that's it, uh, the video games, that --
R:  That's --
L:  -- every kid now has TVs in their bedrooms and --
R:  And computers and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- which, you know, I mean, er, computers, I mean, that's good for the brain, I'm all for that but once -- if you get addicted --
L:  But limit it.
R:  Or --
L:  Especially now for us, it's summer, it's nice out.  There's no school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Get outside and get moving.  It's harder with school [NOISE] and by the time you get their [NOISE] activities and homework done --
R:  That's correct --
L:  -- but now there's --
R:  -- yeah.
L:  -- none of that, to get out and get moving.
R:  Mm.
L:  And I don't know about in out California, how their school systems are.  Our schools are hurting like for money and one of the things -- the first things they cut out is gym class.
R:  Um, well, yeah, they're -- they're hurting for money here too, supposedly.  I gue- -- they're probably doing that -- they say that everywhere all the time --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- but -- but, uh, I don't know what they're cutting out. [NOISE] I don't -- I don't have any kids, so I --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- don't pay attention really [LAUGH] to --
L:  It's --
R:  -- what --
L:  -- frustrating, 'cause you know, to sit for eight hours in school, the kids need that gym time --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to get out and move.
R:  Yeah and I d- -- I remember, you know, when -- it's like I said, you know, everybody had to take --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- PE.  Yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- everybody, you had to do it.  And then I just remember people going, "Well, people shouldn't have to do that, you know.  Why do they -- should they have to do it if they don't want to?"  Well, when you're --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- young, who care -- 
L:  Need to get --
R:  -- I mean --
L:  -- moving, yeah.
R:  You have to do something [LAUGH] that you don't like 'til when you're eighteen and okay, you don't have to do it [LAUGH] any more. [LAUGH]
L:  But if they start learning it young and keep it up through the school years, then they're more apt to keep doing it later on.
R:  I mean --
L:  'Cause they're --
R:  -- yeah, when I was --
L:  -- keen.
R:  -- in school -- when I was, er, you know -- I maybe the exception but when I was in school, I loved PE.  I thought that was the best class of the day. [LAUGH]
L:  It was the -- yeah, you know, you're not sitting and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- thinking, you get to actually do something.
R:  Yeah, I mean, I'm saying, "All right, PE, great". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That was -- that was the best time [inaudible] [LAUGH].  But --
L:  Er --
R:  -- so ...
L:  Well, yeah, I don't -- I don't know.  That's -- that's -- I have kids and one of my kids, um -- one son that I walk with is heavier and it's not that he eats junk food, it's he eats too much food, so now I have to get him moving, it's -- and he's not oh, like the kids you see that are all round but he's [NOISE] overweight for his age.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah but he's big boned and it's -- it's very hard once they get into that rut, to get it off.
R:  But you know --
L:  You c- --
R:  -- uh, my brother was too but you know, sometimes at that age, you re- -- you really can't tell.  I mean, if they're not --
L:  No.
R:  -- you know, completely gigantic --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah, I mean, it's not that -- my brother, you know, he was like that too.  Everybody said, "Oh, yeah, yeah".  But you know, when he [inaudible], you know, he never ended up, you know, really obese --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or anything.  He's -- he's just a normal guy.  So, I don't know.  Um, I mean, some kids are, you know -- y- yeah, some kids are bigger boned.  I mean, he's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- bigger boned than me.  I know he is.  He's a bigger guy than I am.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But -- and everybody said, "Oh, look at him" and they called him -- oh, what'd they call?  Husky or something.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, he's come home from school, saying kids call him fat and it's like, you know what --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- some of those kids aren't any skinnier but that --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- he's big for his age.  He's taller than everybody else and big.
R:  What grade is he in?  First?
L:  In -- he'll be in first grade coming back to school.
R:  Oh, right.
L:  But he's big all -- oh, you know, he's taller than everybody too and it's so frustrating. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I mean, does he eat like big giant -- like you said, he eats bowls of --
L:  Yeah, he used to eat -- yeah, now we limit.  He has a hard time limiting himself.
R:  But I mean --
L:  And it's normal food.  It's not junk food.  Just like the meat and potatoes you fix, or even fruits and vegetables, which aren't bad for him but you know, everything in moderation, he doesn't know how to quit.
R:  Do you mean, he'll sit there and just -- yes but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- does he like fruits and vegetables?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  So, he'll --
L:  He eats a lot --
R:  -- just eat that --
L:  -- of that.
R:  -- well, he could eat all those all day and he wouldn't be fat.  I mean [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah, he eats the regular foods too.  He just doesn't know when to stop or if he has something sitting out --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  If he sees food, he thinks he needs to eat it.
R:  Well, he enjoys it then. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, he does. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And it's -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and it's like, "You know you got to learn when to stop". 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I think that's part of everybody's problem though, you know.  We enjoy it but you don't know when to stop.
R:  Yeah, that's true, that's true.  So -- but that's part of health and fitness.
L:  I know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But, um, I don't know, walking is a very good -- I mean, uh, my -- my parents got me starting to walk because I was starting to end up, you know, just doing a weight training and that was it until I just started walking dogs and I found it to be very fun, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then -- and I -- then I started instead of -- instead of doing it like a certain course --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, like w- walk a certain way every day, I just started to start my c- -- you know, look at my watch and just walk, you know, for a certain amount of time --
L:  Well, that --
R:  -- and just walk wherever it would take me.  You know, walk --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- different down, different places, different everywhere, every day.
L:  Do you live in the city too where you got -- can take different paths?
R:  Um, well, yeah, well, I live in --
L:  Like a sub- --
R:  -- I live in the suburbs of Los Angeles, so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so I live --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- like, there -- there are hills around too.  I live very -- like, um -- it's suburbs --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and so there -- there are hills and stuff that I can go up into.
L:  Now, for me to get a different route, it's hard where I live in the country, [NOISE] where your neighbors, you know, are three quarters of a mile away.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  So, yeah, I have a dirt road to walk on and --
R:  How nice [NOISE].  I wish I lived there. [LAUGH]
L:  I do like it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Except there's not much, you know -- it's like, to even try to roller blade or bike ride, it's harder, 'cause it's all dirt road.
R:  God, I've always --
L:  Instead of
R:  -- wanted to --
L:  -- paved.
R:  -- live --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I've always wanted to live in a place like that instead of here.
L:  I -- I can't handle the city.  I do like the country but then when it comes for opportunities like that, there's not so many around.
R:  Right.  I guess not, man.  When -- and once you get stuck here in the city, it's hard to get out of there because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you have to be financially --
L:  Give up -- able to give --
R:  -- able to --
L:  -- all that up too.
R:  Yeah.  So, well, maybe --
L:  In the wintertime it's hard to find something to do --
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  -- 'cause it gets, you know, below zero.  Unless you have something inside and you can only do so many tapes.
R:  Is it like -- uh, you live in northern Michigan?
L:  Yep, in the thumb, the tip of the thumb.  Michigan's --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- like a bit -- yeah.
R:  'Cause I -- I was born in Minnesota, so I kind of know --
L:  Your winters I think were a little bit worse. [LAUGH]
R:  Y- yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's hard for me to remember, it was a long time ago.  But, uh, I -- I was born in Minnesota, so I kind of remember --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the coldness.
L:  Mm, yeah, it's -- it gets bad.  You know when it's -- the wind chill's twenty below, it's kind of --
