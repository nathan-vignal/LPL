L:  Hi.
R:  Christi-
L:  My name is Pony[?]
R:  I'm Christina.
L:  [NOISE] Um, I'm in [NOISE] Valdosta, Georgia, [SIGH] and, um, yes, I exercise on a daily basis. [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] I'm in Buffalo, New York, and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I used to exercise until I got pregnant. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, boy. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, I've got [NOISE] three children, so I've [NOISE] been there and done that. [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  Um --
R:  This is my first one.
L:  Oh, really? [NOISE]
R:  Yes.
L:  Well, you got a joy ahead of you. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Um, no, [NOISE] I'm actually very [SIGH] [MN] -- very much [NOISE] into my health and fitness. [NOISE] I'm [NOISE] real careful about how many -- [NOISE] counting my calories and [SIGH] working out every day and [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] keeping my children healthy, so 
R:  Well, I work out every day, but I didn't watch my calories.
L:  [NOISE] Really? [LAUGH] 
R:  I didn't really need to because I always ate fresh vegetables and fruit, it was just a non stop basis with me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm surprised I didn't go meatless, but --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [NOISE] I won't do that, I like my meat. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Well, my husband insists on having meat at every meal, [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] so, um, I ten- and -- and I tend to [NOISE] -- even when I was young I never had to worry about what I ate [SIGH] and it seems like after my second child, it was either stay on the ball or I was putting on ten pounds at a time.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] So, uh, I have to be really careful about it now. [NOISE] I guess my age is catching up with me. [LAUGH] 
R:  How old are you?
L:  Um, twenty eight.
R:  That's it?
L:  Yes.
R:  I'm thirty four.
L:  Really?
R:  Yes, [NOISE] and this is my first child.
L:  [SIGH] Goodness gracious.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  [MN] My best friend is thirty two and she's fixing to have her first one. [SIGH] 
R:  Wow.
L:  I started young. [LAUGH] Um, [MN] anyhow, my -- my physical fitness [NOISE] plan just [NOISE] -- it consists of, um, [SIGH] I walk every single morning, three --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- miles a day. [LAUGH] 
R:  There you go.
L:  And, um, [LIPSMACK] uh, we have a home gym and [NOISE] I work out with weights and do [MN] step aerobics [SIGH] and that type of stuff.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I also love to dance, so --
R:  Oh, wonderful.
L:  -- that's a -- a real good [NOISE] motivator. [LAUGH] 
R:  We have a weight set up downstairs and then [LIPSMACK] I have two machines, one's called the air glider --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it's just the best.  It's like just getting on this thing, stepping on it and swoosh, swoosh --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- like you're skiing.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  Like you're skiing.
L:  Oh, goodness.
R:  And it -- it's just the best thing --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and the other one my sister gave me and I'm not sure of the name on this one, but you sit on it and you really pull.
L:  Really?
R:  While you're pulling it towards your body, [SIGH] you got to do it together with the feet.  This is not --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- something -- I mean, I tried just doing it with my feet, oh, my gosh, I can't even hold myself up.
L:  Oh, goodness. [LAUGH]  
R:  My husband couldn't do it -- it -- that's how [SIGH] difficult this machine is.
L:  Wow.
R:  And it's awesome --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it really is awesome --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you hold your stomach in --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] and it really --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- really, really tightens --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you up and it really gets that --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- belly out, and I know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I'm not going to have a problem right after I'm pregnant --
L:  Oh, good.
R:  -- at all.
L:  [LAUGH] So, I guess not.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'd like to find one of those. [NOISE] 
R:  Let me see if I --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I'll go down stairs and look at the name. [SIGH] 
L:  We have, um, just, like, a free weight set, um, [SIGH] with a -- I don't know what you call this, a weight bench with all kind of attachments on it. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] And, um, I stair climber and, um, an exercise bicycle --
R:  Oh, there you go.
L:  -- stationary bike, whatever you call it. [SIGH] So --
R:  This one's called cardio glide.
L:  Huh, well, that's one I haven't heard of.
R:  It's awesome.  I've never enjoyed anything else but this, it's a --
L:  Really?
R:  -- west low cardio l- glide.
L:  Huh, I'll get on the internet and do a search --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- for that one. [LAUGH] Um --
R:  Very nice.
L:  Uh --
R:  I love these things, I mean, I'm not going to -- I'm not going to jog. [SIGH] I don't have that into me --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I do walk a lot c- with the -- uh, the dogs.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And [SIGH] me and my husband, [MN] we do walk a lot.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, [MN] well, now see, I h- that's my -- my morning private time, I go for a walk before anybody else is awake. [LAUGH] 
R:  Very good, very good.
L:  [SIGH] So, and then we have, um, uh, an amusement park here in town, it's called wild adventures --
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] wow.
L:  -- and with it being summertime, I'm out there with the kids at least three or four times [NOISE] a week. [NOISE] 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And that's constant walking. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, gee.
L:  [SIGH] And I noticed the other day, it was the first time I've gotten on any of the roller coasters --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and I discovered that that's a real good [NOISE] tummy trimmer because it's like [NOISE] the minute you get on it, your whole stomach tightens up and it doesn't let loose [NOISE] until --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- the ride is over. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] So  [NOISE] 
R:  That's always fun, though.
L:  Oh, yeah, th- we've had a ton of fun out there. [NOISE] 
R:  Wonderful.
L:  [SIGH] Um, [NOISE] let's see.  And as far as, like, [NOISE] food and -- and that type of stuff, I'm just [NOISE] -- you know, with three kids I do my best to [SIGH] have healthy meals and, [SIGH] you know, a good serving of fruits and vegetables --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [LAUGH] all the time.
R:  [SIGH] He gets made at me 'cause I'm always, always, every day I make a new dessert.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, now that's neat.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm not a really big -- I'm not really big on cooking. [LAUGH] [SIGH] I'm honestly --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- not.  I -- I have -- [SIGH] we have our tried and true favorites that get fixed over and over and over again. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] Now, my husband, [NOISE] he could be a gourmet chef --
R:  Okay. [NOISE] 
L:  -- um, and he cooks all kind of different things, [NOISE] um, but --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [NOISE] I'm a --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- spaghetti and meatballs kind of person. [LAUGH] 
R:  I have to cook, I have to keep up with [NOISE] his mum's cooking. [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] Oh, I don't even try to keep up with his mum's cooking.
R:  [COUGH] [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't even try any more --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- she is --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- she's l- I don't know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- she's like one of --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- those that tries out all these --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- new recipes and [NOISE] they all turn --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- out perfectly the first time. [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] Unreal.
L:  Mine, I try a new recipe and I'm lucky if I can get anybody in the house to eat it. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] So 
R:  [SIGH] Oy, oy, oy.
L:  [SIGH] Um, but the biggest thing that -- that we try to watch out for is, you know, [NOISE] um, cholesterol [NOISE] and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- salt content and --
R:  Definitely and we --
L:  -- you know, we --
R:  -- drink lots and lots and lots of water.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, yes, water's a big one.  Um, [SIGH] and then my husband, he's -- he's into the body building [SIGH] and he, like, takes all these different supplements and [SIGH] --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- [inaudible] he takes amino acids and weight gainers and vitamins [NOISE] and creatine monohydrate and --
R:  Oh, my gosh, that's a lot.
L:  -- he is -- he is very into [LAUGH] his fitness.
R:  I mean, gee, my husband, he works --
L:  What, now?
R:  -- h works electrical, but he used to use -- [SIGH] he used to build golf courses --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] and he would drink Gatorade and Powerade --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and stuff like that.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And it's like he never had to work out.
L:  Really. [LAUGH] 
R:  No, he's just a fit man.
L:  [SIGH] Goodness.
R:  And I'm like, "Ooh, I am so lucky to have this one". [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Uh, yeah, also my husband the other day, I said, "You" I said, "Out of all my friends are the only husband that still has a twenty nine inch waist". [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] [NOISE] So, but he --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- he's in there every single day, [NOISE] I mean, he takes, like, two days off that he doesn't workout, [SIGH] uh, and other than that he's in there every day and he's always --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- real careful about --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, what he puts in his body and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- this, that and the other, but --
R:  Good.
L:  -- [SIGH] it pays off 'cause he's in really good shape. [NOISE] 
R:  Right and he's teaching the kids well also.
L:  Right. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, and you are also.
L:  Um, yeah, and, in fact, we're getting him l- a little tub right next [NOISE] to that for Christmas this year.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, wonderful.
L:  So, um --
R:  Oh, that's great.
L:  -- our oldest is nine and --
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  -- he -- he's wanting to build him some muscles. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] So 
R:  [SIGH] That's wonderful. [NOISE] 
L:  But, you know, I -- I like the idea of -- you know, none of our children are overweight and that's really important to me because there s- [SIGH] seems to be so much of that in -- going on today. [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] Seriously.
L:  Um, I know I've got six nieces and nephews and all of them, in my opinion, are overweight.
R:  Ooh. [NOISE] 
L:  Two of them are seriously [LAUGH] overweight. [LAUGH] 
R:  Ouch.
L:  So, I just -- I -- I really try hard to encourage healthier eating habits in --
R:  Right.
L:  -- mine. [SIGH] Um, and they all seem to be a really good size, you know, they're healthy but [SIGH] far, far, far from being [LAUGH] overweight. [NOISE] 
R:  [LAUGH] I mean, I was a chunky --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- kid growing up, but --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- after that, you know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you just get --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- more motivated --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I was more into sports and--
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] I got into that, [SIGH] and then --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  --I just stayed the way --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I was.
L:  [NOISE] Um, I think all kids [NOISE] go through a little phase --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [NOISE] you know, um, [NOISE] but it just [NOISE] -- I remember going to my [NOISE] -- my son's [NOISE] school last year, [NOISE] [SIGH] half the kids in his class [NOISE] of nine year olds [NOISE] were what I could call [NOISE] extremely overweight. 
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  I mean, like, [NOISE] probably [LAUGH] ten to fifteen [NOISE] pounds more [NOISE] heavier than they should have been. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] So, and my son's just, uh -- he looks like this [NOISE] -- I mean, he's tiny anyway [NOISE] and -- you know, like, I -- I was always real short and real tiny.  When I was in the sixth grade [NOISE] I looked like I should have been going in the third grade. [NOISE] 
R:  Okay.
L:  [NOISE] And, um, [NOISE] he has, [NOISE] you know, he's got [NOISE] my build and [SIGH] -- but, yeah, I p- [NOISE] I see him [NOISE] agai- you know, up against the other kids [NOISE] in his class and [SIGH] he looks like he [NOISE] is just totally out of place. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  I was always tall.
L:  Really?
R:  I was always t- I'm only -- I assumed I was always five ten --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [SIGH] and then here I come to notice that after ten years they tell me --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [LAUGH] "You're actually five eight".
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I'm like --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- "Oh, did I shrink?" [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  [SIGH] I'm like, "Come on".
L:  You know what, though?  After a pregnancy I truly believe [NOISE] you do shrink. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  Oy, oy, oy.
L:  [NOISE] I'm not kidding, I [NOISE] -- I know I lost a half an inch after I had my third child. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Thank you Nicholas. [NOISE] No, you can't have any. [LAUGH] [NOISE] No, no, no, that'll break and make a big mess.  Mummy's got some cooking over here.  So, anyway, [LAUGH] [NOISE] um, [NOISE] um, [NOISE] we're working on finding -- finding healthy [NOISE] snacks for them --
R:  Right.
L:  -- 'cause my littlest one is three and [NOISE] she's not --
