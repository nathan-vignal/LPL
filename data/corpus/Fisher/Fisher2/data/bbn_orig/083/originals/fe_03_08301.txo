R:  Hi --
L:  Hello.
R:  -- this is Samantha Barrett.
L:  Hello, my name is Sully, Sully Sheedham[?] in Houston, Texas, and, um, I think the topic is, uh, whether or not priv- public or, uh, parochial schools can, um, uh, require p- require students to read certain books.
R:  Right.  Um, what do you think about that?
L:  Um, well [LAUGH] it seems like at some point you have to have a set curriculum and, um, [COUGH] excuse me, you can only have so many books in a library, um, and requiring students to choose from a list of books seems relatively appropriate.  What do you think?
R:  Um, being a, uh, public school teacher for the last two years and working as a media specialist in the library --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, I believe that children, you know, there should be at least that guideline.  Um, perhaps there should be some sort of, uh, selection that the teachers can choose from so that it's like not one standard list.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, a myriad of -- of lists, um, a selection that the children can read from or perhaps even something that parents can choose from and -- and decide to help -- you know, be more involved --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in that process so I don't know.  What do you think?
L:  [COUGH] True.  It seems very rational, um, having a list of books that would probably be appropriate or more appropriate for that, um, age group, of that, um -- you know, whether it's an honors class or regular class or remedial class, um, and then have the children, you know, be able to choose from a list seems appropriate.  I think what they're trying to get at though is are there, um, certain books that students shouldn't be reading, um, with maybe like sexual connotations or is somehow inappropriate in some -- in some, uh, manner?
R:  Yeah, I think that also, uh, kinda falls in line with, um, having parents more involved in the selection process --
L:  Sure, sure.
R:  -- because, you know, there's inappropriate, you know, sexual content, then there's certain areas where parents just don't want their kids being involved.  For instance, like Harry Potter --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, with my experience a lot of my students -- well, a handful of my students, the parents don't want them, you know, reading that selection because of the wizardry and the witchcraft and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it -- you know, it doesn't fall in line with their religious beliefs --
L:  Sure, sure.
R:  -- and practices and, you know --
L:  Although the Pope said it was okay [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, you still have some parents that --
L:  I know.  I'm teasing.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I know.  I know.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Um, but I just think that, you know, parents should, uh, be more involved in the whole selection process.
L:  And then from an extension of what I said previously in terms of censorship, how do you feel about, like, history books and such being censored, um, from -- I don't know very much about this topic at all but, uh, from the little they've put on the TV in terms of -- there's, um, a very -- a very biased view of -- of some part of our -- of our American history being -- being portrayed.
R:  Well, I don't think it should be censored but I think that all accounts of history should be, you know, portrayed equally and properly.
L:  It's kinda difficult to do that though [LAUGH]?
R:  Pardon?
L:  It's kinda difficult to do that though.
R:  Yeah, it's difficult to do but --
L:  I mean, we hear almost nothing about, um, you know, Asian history, about, uh, African history, even about south American, we hear almost nothing about.  Um, about Canadian history, we hear nothing about.  Um, uh, we -- we hear a very small amount of European history, um -- how do you feel about that?  I'm not sure if that goes under the heading of censorship or simply just, you know, American, uh, [LAUGH] um --
R:  Well, then, yeah, well I feel if -- if it's not all -- well, then if it's all censored because it's not properly reported then I mean that would just take away from history itself, you know, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the way that it's delivered --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- in -- in books for the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, educational curriculum --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, um, was there -- was -- was there, uh -- did it cover censorship under any other aspects of, uh, educational books or was it just --
L:  I think it gave us a bl- -- blanket, you know, whatever we want to talk about basically in terms of censorship in the -- in the school system.
R:  Yeah, well basically I think that anything, you know, sexually connotated should be censored, um -- 
L:  Sure.
R:  -- and just because of the -- of the separation of church and state perhaps any, you know, religious, um, innuendoes should also be, uh, censored because, you know, you have so many different types of people and so many different types of -- of, uh, beliefs and, you know, you cover one area and you're offending someone else and, you know, although as a teacher myself I may believe in a certain thing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I may want to share, you know, that belief with my students or read a books related to that, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's just -- it's just -- it's safe to just, you know, x out all, uh, religious context -- content --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in, uh, educational books because it's just such a touchy subject and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- yeah.  What about -- what else do you think should be censored?
L:  Well, I think that there's many things that we could take for -- for granted.  I mean, I -- I think almost all parents wouldn't want gratuitous violence, wouldn't want sexual connotations --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- wouldn't want stuff like that but I think what we're talking -- I think what would be a little more difficult would be things that are a little bit less black and white [COUGH] excuse me.  My allergies are acting up.  Um, things that have to do more with, um, you know, the way history is portrayed.  Um, that sort of thing.  I think those fall into much more murky ground.  What types of, um, um, uh, I'm not sure what else is -- I -- I guess I just don't really know very much about what is censored.  Um, I'm -- I'm assuming a great deal of filtering takes place in terms of determining what children read and what they don't read and what they're taught, what they're not taught.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, I --
L:  I'm kinda ignorant about it though.
R:  Yeah, I mean, pretty much I think, uh, violence, religion --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- um, pretty much spans what should be -- what should be censored --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as far as educational material and, uh, you know, in schools for elementary age students and then if we're -- would -- did -- did it go just into elementary or did that [several inaudible words] high school or did they specify?
L:  I don't think they specified.  I think they talked about all --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just the public school system --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the public or parochial school system.
R:  Yeah, and then, you know -- and I think most of the censorship really should take place in elementary schools.  I mean, [MN] although with high schools, kids -- I feel kids, you know, minors -- they're still minors but I think that, uh, high school -- those students should have a little bit more freedom --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as to, you know, what they can take in --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- um, you know, because they're older and because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they're at a stage in life where they're beginning to make their own decisions and, you know, parents should still have a part in the selection process, I believe --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- regardless to whether it's elementary aged or, uh, it's high school aged --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- kids but, um, that's pretty much what -- do you have anything else to add?
L:  Um, well there were things that were -- that were brought up on the news not too long ago about how Little Red Riding Hood was banned.  Um, there were some other [COUGH] -- I think Alice in Wonderland was banned.  There were a couple of other general what seems like relatively innocuous books that were banned.
R:  Yeah, well if you look at the -- the very original versions of those fables --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that were --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, written, um, most of the original versions 'cause actually I did, um, a lesson on fairy tales, one of my lessons, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and when you find the original versions of the stories, I mean, they're very violent, sexual in nature.  Now, of course, the version that we have now in children's books, you know, aren't the same versions but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the originals of those stories, you'd be really -- have you ever seen any of those?
L:  I haven't, I mean, but I assume if they're anything like the Canterbury Tales and you know, they can't be, uh, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I definitely wouldn't want my kids reading Canterbury Tales or anything like that.
R:  Yeah, so, um, now I don't know what they're reading, what versions of those fables they're reading to the kids.  Now, of course, if they're reading the original version then sure they should be banned --
L:  Mhm.
R: -- but, um, -- and then a lot of the -- the -- the innuendoes in those stories are kind of more so for adults so children really can't pick up on those --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but if you want to get into, you know, the subconscious and subliminal messages and things of --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that nature then you may want to consider, but once again I think that that falls along the lines of the parents --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- having their hand in it because it -- the teacher can only, you know, teach their curriculum.
