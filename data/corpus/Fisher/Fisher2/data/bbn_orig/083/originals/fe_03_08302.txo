R:  Hello.
L:  Hello, hi. [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] Hello. [LAUGH] 
L:  Hi, I'm Elvira. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Hi, I'm Laura. [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] And I guess we're supposed to talk about censorship. [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay, sorry, I had both of my little ones on me, I couldn't quite hear very well, [LAUGH] um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um, censorship, is that the topic?
L:  Censor- censorship, especially [SIGH] should kids be able to, um, [MN] re- be required to read certain books at s- in school. [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay, okay. [SIGH] 
L:  I think --
R:  Um, in your view? [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Well, I [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- think that, [SIGH] um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [MN] if -- if it's too censored --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- then, [SIGH] um --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- [MN] they'll lose some freedoms and I think parents would object. [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Would you object? [LAUGH] Or --
R:  [MN] Um --
L:  -- do you care what they read? [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh, I definitely c- [SIGH] I definitely care what they read --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I think sometimes I think they go overboard, um, as far as the censorship, [SIGH] um, they put on, [MN] you know, the schools [NOISE] these days. [SIGH] Um, [MN] I think that, um, [NOISE] Uh, [SIGH] [MN] I'm sorry. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I know, I -- I, uh --
R:  [SIGH] I had some -- I had some [NOISE] background. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I know, sometimes I have background, I have --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- well, mine are -- [SIGH] my children are grown, but it's, [SIGH] um, grandchildren are in the background sometimes. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH] 
L:  [inaudible] [LAUGH] 
R:  I have to have them, so you have to excuse me, [SIGH] but, um --
L:  [SIGH] B- B- but I think --
R:  -- oh, gosh, it's not a real big, uh, issue [NOISE] right now as far as it's -- y, that I [SIGH] have to deal with. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, and I think it depends on the kids' ages, I mean, if it's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- talking about --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- teenagers, I think they can be -- [SIGH] it's almost worse, because teenagers can be so --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- easily swayed --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] and, um, [SIGH] I guess --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- if they --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- uh, can't read --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- a book, [SIGH] um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I wouldn't like 'em to just be open to anything.  I'm thinking of my grandchildren, I have four teenage grandchildren, and I think [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that, um, [SIGH] uh, it should have some [SIGH] -- that the schools should [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- uh, look at what they're reading, [SIGH] up --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- you know, up to a point.
R:  Right.
L:  Um [LAUGH] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I would think that there --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- should also be --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] public or parent -- parental --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- input --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  -- because, [SIGH] um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- uh, [LAUGH] [MN] if -- the people in power at the time, [SIGH] uh, could have an awful lot of influence on --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the kids. [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE] True.
L:  [SIGH] Just by what they restricted or by what they allowed them to read. [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh. [SIGH] And --
L:  And it -- but -- what do you think? [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, y- [SIGH] but I -- I sorta think that it gets blown out of proportion sometimes too, just, like, for instance, [SIGH] I have -- um, of course, this isn't -- it's supposed to pertain to school, right?
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] Uh, although this isn't a book that it -- it is in school, but, like, Harry Potter, for instance --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] I know a lot of, um, people are very, um, [SIGH] against it --
L:  [LIPSMACK] [NOISE]  
R:  -- teachers, you know, um, I've heard that once they read Harry Potter, they don't feel that it's, you know, such a bad -- [SIGH] a bad book or [MN] about witchcraft, I mean it -- it's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- of course, it's fictional. [LAUGH] 
L:  right. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] And, uh, obviously, I mean, and -- [SIGH] but I think in a lot of people -- [MN] they give it a bad rap and I think --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they're too -- very judgmental about -- [SIGH] as far as I've heard, um, some teachers, uh, against it -- you know, against that book --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [SIGH] but --
L:  And that would be one of the books that they would say, "Well, you can't --" and I don't know if it's allowed in [SIGH] --
R:  In the schools.
L:  -- [MN] in the schools.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I --
R:  I --
L:  -- [MN] that'd be interesting if it's in the learning centers or [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [MN] and I really don't know. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] I haven't -- [SIGH] I mean, I've heard a lot of controversy on it too, and I know in our family there's a lot of controversy [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, and if that were one of the books that, say, you can't read, [SIGH] it would be upsetting because [SIGH] I think of it more as a fictional book.  I haven't read it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- though, I -- I haven't but I have a [SIGH] daughter and a granddaughter who have read the whole series. [LAUGH] It's --
R:  Yeah, uh-huh.
L:  -- um, [SIGH] and if someone -- and I know that -- that they would be very --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- upset --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- if [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if it were something that was banned in the schools because it was bad, they would be very [inaudible], and I [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, our [LAUGH] -- [SIGH] so if that is the type of, um, censorsh- and I know Stephen King is another author that is [SIGH] highly controversial and --
R: Mhm. 
L:  -- um, [MN] I don't b- I know that in the school, um, systems [SIGH] they're not allowed to -- uh, the teacher that one of my daughters had [SIGH] did not allow, um, that -- any book reports on his books because they felt it was detrimental.
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  And, uh [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- um --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- [MN] she didn't feel that way and she was very [LAUGH] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and she was an [SIGH] A student in school, and, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- Uh-huh.
R:  -- [SIGH] this is [MN] because she felt that it was, [SIGH] uh, presumptuous of them to be [SIGH] banning that book. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right, right. Um --
R:  [MN] [SIGH] 
L:  -- I -- I -- I haven't read any Stephen King myself.  What grade was --
R:  I don't --
L:  -- this?
R:  -- either. [SIGH] Now, Stephen -- this was a high school class.
L:  High school class, uh-huh.
R:  It was honors class.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [SIGH] And it isn't my particular -- I don't like it because it's too morbid for me. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [SIGH] And I [LAUGH] [SIGH] --
L:  -- but it isn't -- it's very -- uh, it's um -- she greatly enjoyed it and [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, she felt that it -- it was [SIGH] wrong of them to, [SIGH] um, censor it. [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh. [SIGH] 
L:  So, I can understand.  It's so subjective, censorship, though. [SIGH] 
R:  R- [SIGH] 
L:  I [MN] --
R:  Now, and -- and -- for it -- I mean, I've never -- I n- uh, myself, know of anything that has actually [SIGH] -- you know, I can't think of anything [SIGH] in particular that has been banned.  Now, of course, I wouldn't want any foul language or [SIGH] --
L:  No.
R:  -- anything in there [MN] that, you know, just that's going to be ridiculous, but, [SIGH] I guess, you know, [MN] the side -- like you just said, the Stephen King, I don't know, [SIGH] unless it was just too [MN] gory, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the reason.
L:  And I suppose they figured -- I mean, to me it's too gory. [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh, yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, the movies.
L:  [SIGH] But I'll -- [LAUGH] but it isn't, it's, um -- [SIGH] and I know it -- it's -- I -- I used to read Agatha Christie and just [MN] enjoy that type of mystery and [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I know at one point my [MN] -- I remember growing up that my mother thought, [SIGH] "Oh, maybe that's a bad influence to read Agatha Christie". [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] And so people are, you know [LAUGH] -- everybody is different in what they think is [SIGH] -- [MN] is --
R:  Correct, or 
L:  -- sort of, yeah, [MN] correct --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- yeah.
R:  Well --
L:  But, uh [SIGH] --
R:  I know when -- I have a fourteen year old that loves to read.  He reads --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a lot [SIGH] and -- which I'm happy, and I've never been concerned about what he's reading, but [SIGH] now my -- I have, uh, [MN] two more, [SIGH] um, twelve and ten and, you know, [LAUGH] oh, man --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- I would love if they'd read anything. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right, [LAUGH] I know. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Unfortunately, um [SIGH] --
L:  And, yeah, 'cause that's like with the Harry Potter too, I know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] um, I have a friend that has a son that's [SIGH] fourteen and he doesn't like to read, but he does like to read Harry Potter and she's thrilled., [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] And --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- she [LAUGH] -- and she's the type that is very, um, [SIGH] um -- very moral person. [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, [SIGH] I d- I wouldn't want anybody -- [MN] [SIGH] I don't know, I -- I [SIGH] -- like, I agree with you that I don't want -- [SIGH] I wouldn't want kids to read things that have foul language or [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, things like that, but I think --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a lot of other things are as -- very subjective.
R:  Or banning, uh, [MN] something that was very, um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] on the -- on the lines that -- like, religion that said, you know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, bad things about another [SIGH] religion or -- [MN] I mean, but --
L:  I know.
R:  -- to me there's -- unfortunately [LAUGH] there's so many -- [SIGH] listening to music is a lot worse than, you know, [SIGH] a lot of [LAUGH] -- a lot of the books they [MN] -- you know, aren't anywhere near a lot -- some of the, you know, [SIGH] the ones that [NOISE] I know and -- uh, they are talked about in the past, you know, that shouldn't be, [SIGH] um,  [NOISE] read in schools, but --
L:  Right, and I -- [SIGH] um, still it's very [LAUGH] hard without it -- more information to just [SIGH] --
R:  To just --
L:  -- bluntly say do you object or do you not. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right, right. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] You know --
R:  [SIGH] That's kind -- without having, um -- [MN] it hasn't given us a list, or, you know --
L:  Right. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- [SIGH] on what to say, um --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Y-
R:  -- on which [SIGH] -- what books, [LAUGH] 'cause you know --
L:  Yeah, 'cause you know, that's too -- [LAUGH] that's too [SIGH] --
R:  Broad. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- broad, right. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right, [LAUGH] because it can't -- I w [SIGH] -- uh, [MN] you don't want all books, br- uh, you know, banned, or [SIGH] who would -- who would do the, [SIGH] uh [MN] -- who would do the banning?  I mean, who would s- say which books are -- uh, can't be?  Would it be the school board, would it be [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, um, [MN] the pastors in the town?  Would it [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [SIGH] who would it be?  The parents?  I mean, who gets to say, the principal? [SIGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, um, [SIGH] I think we'd have to have more -- I think I would have to have more [LAUGH] facts in order to [SIGH] make an intelligent, [SIGH] um --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- observation --
R:  On it.
L:  -- rather than [LAUGH] --
R:  Right, right, exactly.
L:  -- you know. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Exactly. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Yes, it --
L:  [MN] But it -- it -- it's an interesting, [SIGH] uh, thought, though, because, uh, and a -- and maybe a -- maybe that's the idea, that [SIGH] -- that if you just say, [SIGH] "Books could be -- how would you feel about books being banned?"  Or [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, [LIPSMACK] then you'd have to -- you couldn't give a yes or a no answer. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right, right.
L:  [SIGH] You know.
R:  But you -- I -- I would [MN] -- I would definitely be interested in knowing, uh, [MN] you know, if [SIGH] there were books being ban- just like Harry Potter, uh, that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like, [MN] if it was banned from my -- the grade school [SIGH] that, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the kids go to, I -- I would definitely be interested, and I'd -- [SIGH] I would want to know why --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [MN] why they felt that it wasn't -- because, um, [MN] he's a -- a warlock, witch or whatever, why --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [SIGH] why did they feel like that's detrimental, why do they feel that -- [SIGH] what they [LAUGH] would feel that would do to a child if he would read it. [LAUGH] 
L:  I know, uh, [MN] right, you'd need more facts and I think they --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- would have -- I think whoever did it w-
