R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  My name's Antonio.
L:  I'm Laura, nice to meet you.
R:  Nice to meet you, Lauren. [LIPSMACK] So, the topic seems to be health and fitness.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, well, I just, uh, [LIPSMACK] recently got a membership at the YMCA. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, started working out, it's a little boring.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I lost quite a bit of weight --
L:  Really?
R:  -- because they say, well, you know, you -- they -- they really push the cardiovascular.
L:  Oh.
R:  And, um, I was -- just lost way too much weight. [LAUGH]
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, well I had changed my diet too, so I was just eating, like, chicken breasts and vegetables and salad.
L:  Uh-huh.  How much were you hoping to lose?
R:  Oh, I -- I'd lo- I was, like, [NOISE] uh, a hundred and like, I lost ten pounds, but it was in, like, the course of a week. [NOISE]
L:  In a week?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, my gosh, what were they having you do there?
R:  Well, it was, like, they wanted you to do at least ten minutes, uh, of cardiovascular --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] it was and then a little -- they had a little, uh, it's like a little bicycle thing you sit down and you pedal --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- get your heart rate up and everything and then I do my, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- my workout with the weight machine. [LIPSMACK]
L:  Hm.
R:  But I had also changed my diet, too, instead of eating whatever I wanted to like the steaks and the hamburgers and fries and things --
L:  Right.
R:  -- yeah and it was just vegetables and [LIPSMACK] boring chicken breast. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, but I'm going to start working out, I'm going to do it a little differently this time --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, I'm gonna keep the steaks and stuff, you know, I just want to lose the midsection, [NOISE] which the cardiovascular does.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  Wow, I [inaudible] so quickly.
R:  Huh?
L:  If -- so, that's ten pounds, that's a lot to lose, like, in a week.
R:  Yeah, but, you know what, I was going, like, every day 'cause, [NOISE] um, I -- I give -- I do volunteer work and when I finish my volunteering, it's -- the gym is right around the corner.
L:  Oh, okay, where do you live?
R:  I live in, uh, Oakland, but I volunteer in San Francisco.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  I'm on the other side of the country, I'm near Philadelphia.
R:  In Philadelphia?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [COUGH] Excuse me.  So, do you work out?
L:  Yeah, um, not as much as I would like to, but on a pretty regular basis I would say, um, my, uh, my fiance's friend is very into fitness and he has, like, all different kinds of, like, size weights and a bench and all sorts of stuff, like, at his house.
R:  So, he's, like, really --
L:  It's --
R:  -- into it?
L:  -- kinda cool because, like, you don't have to pay to use it --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so, you know, we try and, like, run and, um, you know, lifts and stuff like that and, uh, well, for a while, like, I just graduated from college, um --
R:  Congratulations.
L:  -- a little bit more than a year ago -- thank you and, um, [LIPSMACK] so that whole time and all, like, from when I was in school I took, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ballet, I took dance classes, for, like, about six times a week, so that was --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- my exercise [LAUGH] and it's --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- it's something --
R:  -- I bet you're in shape.
L:  -- I would like to do again because I enjoy, but for the time being, I never really lifted weights that much so that was kinda new, like, um, you know, like, being guys, I guess that's what they like to do, but I, you know, I started doing a little bit too now, um, that was pretty good, so, I enjoyed it.  So, you know, I -- I try to keep up with doing it, like, [LIPSMACK] at least three times a week, um, you know, sometimes schedules get all busy and hectic, but --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
L:  -- you know, try to find time to do at least, you know, anywhere from ten minutes to half an hour of that.
R:  Well, they say swimming is really good, you know, it works every muscle in the body and it's good cardiovascular --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which everybody's pushing, which, you know, I did see the benefits, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, [LIPSMACK] I'm kind of a lazy person [LAUGH] when --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it comes to working out, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I don't know, I think I'll, you know, I'll incorporate, uh, [LIPSMACK] swimming with, uh, weight machines or something and --
L:  Yeah, swimming's fun, it's, um --
R:  Have to --
L:  -- actually --
R:  -- learn first.
L:  -- I'm out visiting my parents right now and they have a pool, so I try --
R:  Well --
L:  -- and take advantage of that when I'm here, especially --
R:  Oh, good.
L:  -- when it's, uh, really hot outside, so --
R:  Well, I have to learn to swim first.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH] All these years.
L:  Yeah, it's hard to, um, [LIPSMACK] I -- I'm sort of the same way some [inaudible] being lazy about it, 'cause I'd, like, worked all day and busy and I get, like, you know, an hour to do something for myself --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- which usually wanna, like, relax rather than go, you know, running through the block[?].
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, my fiance's really into, uh, eating very healthy, so -- and -- and I don't cook, he does, so I don't have too much say in that, so of -- I always have the eating healthy part going on there.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah, he likes doing things with, like, a lot of brown rice and barley and lots of green vegetables [LAUGH] and things like that in.
R:  Oh. [NOISE]
L:  'Cause, see, I'm a very open person when it comes to, like, food that way, I'll pretty much try anything, so --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and then I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- figured, well, you know, at least I don't have to worry about trying to eat healthy, he's going to take care of that, so --
R:  Well, that's good.
L:  -- yeah, so if I miss a day of working out at least I know that, you know --
R:  Well, do you get a chance --
L:  -- [several inaudible words] --
R:  -- to sneak out for a cheeseburger?
L:  What was that?
R:  I said, do you at least get a chance to get a cheeseburger? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, when I come and visit at my parents' and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- then I can eat what I want. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, um, but, um, but yeah, it's interesting, because, um, a company that we work with, they deal with, like, um, health and wellness products and, uh, and it's interesting, 'cause most of us aren't really paying attention --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to, um, to things like that.  It's really, like, everywhere now, like, it's a huge thing, you know, everyone's trying to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, eat healthy, work out and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's also in so many, like, commercials and advertisements and, you know, all sorts of stuff for --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for things like that, so --
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  -- which is --
R:  -- I --
L:  -- which is good, I mean, I guess, like, you know, [inaudible] we're not really promoting things like that and, you know, cause a lot of problems for people, but, um --
R:  Yeah, I notice when you -- the older you get, the more your body requires certain things, of course, and [NOISE] --
L:  Right.
L:  -- and there's some things that you're, or should, you know, you're accustomed to that you probably should cut down on or cut out completely, you know, like, uh, the five cups of coffee a day or something --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  You know, like --
L:  There was [several inaudible words].
R:  -- it gets to a point where that's not a good idea any more.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, but --
L:  Yeah, it was interesting, 'cause I have a sister who's, uh, she's only twelve, so she's still at the point where she just, like, eats whatever she wants to and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- doesn't really worry about it and, um, she's really thin to begin with, she -- she dances a lot though, too, so I guess she doesn't have worry about that. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, my sister was just a -- just a s- naturally thin person --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Some people are like that.
R:  -- and then, you know, she, like, turned twenty nine and then --
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- you know, I saw her, I was, like, "Are you pregnant?" [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  Which I probably shouldn't have said. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, you know, all her life --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- she had been, like, real thin, you know and then [NOISE] all of a sudden she just, her body changed and started --
L:  Oh, at --
R:  -- filling out.
L:  -- twenty nine, that's interesting.
R:  Yeah.  And it --
L:  I would think you would usually be, like, at least when you're, like, forty.
R:  Well, you know what?  Um, when I turned thirty, that's when my body changed.
L:  Oh.
R:  I gained quite a bit of weight, just, I don't why, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- right after my thirtieth birthday, you know, and I just -- one day I just decided, said, "Yeah, you know, this doesn't look too good, I'm not too satisfied with this", so I just -- I didn't, like, do anything to, like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- work it off, I just stopped eating so much.
L:  Right.
R:  Well, me, you know, I was living in a place where it was, like, really, really, really boring --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and there was nothing to do, no place to go, so, you know, I was in the kitchen cooking all the time --
L:  Right.
R:  -- experimenting with recipes, so --
L:  Oh, that's interesting, I guess, like, for me I -- I mean I've lived, uh, you know, between living a life in different places and -- and then at college for, like, the past five years, not living with my parents, I, uh, pretty much only ever eat, um, when there's somebody else that's making food. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, if I'm, like, not around people that are making food, then I don't need to think about [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah [MN] yeah.
L:  So, I don't know, like, I just never, um, I don't know, and a lot of times, like, I was just living by myself, so I wouldn't want to, like, you know, make a whole meal, so I'd only eat, you know, like, fruit or something, like, really little.
R:  Oh, you know what?  I -- I'm very bad at that, I hardly ever eat fruit, I bought some today and I forced myself to, [LIPSMACK] and, you know, but I love vegetables, so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I guess that compensates for it, I hope.
L:  Yeah, yeah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- 'cause most people, I think, would prefer fruit than vegetables, so -- so vegetables are very good, so that probably helps.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, but [MN] I'm going to get back into the whole health and fitness regimen. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, every -- every day, I actually just bought a health magazine today, um --
R:  Which one?
L:  You know, they could all be, like ...
