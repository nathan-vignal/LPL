R:  Hi --
L: [NOISE] 
R:  -- my name --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is Betty.
L:  [NOISE] Hi --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- Betty.
R:  [LAUGH] And I'm a real exercise nut.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  How 'bout you?
L:  [NOISE] Uh, my name is Chris and [NOISE], um, I am not an exercise nut at all.  Um, and I [NOISE] very reg- [LAUGH] -- yeah, I'd be lucky if I -- I just played softball about a week ago and started getting out of breath, just, you know --
R:  Oh, I --
L:  -- playing softball.
R:  -- love -- I love to exercise.  In fact --
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  -- I went swimming twice today.
L:  That's -- I hear that swimming is the, uh -- is that --
R:  It --
L:  -- the best, um -- the best thing --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- for you actually, isn't it?
R:  It's very easy.  For me, it's like a nap.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  When I swim, I come out feeling so refreshed, it's as if I --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- took a nap for half an hour.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Anyway, this morning I walked a mile to get --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to the pool where I swim.
L:  Right.
R:  I really catch a bus to get there but I have to walk a good five or six blocks to get to the bus and when I [NOISE] get off the bus, I had to walk another four blocks to get to the spa.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I [NOISE], uh -- I get over there by a quarter to eight and I started doing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a few laps.  I usually do about thirty laps but I have --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- an eight o'clock water exercise class --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that's a lot of fun, in the morning.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- did that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] um, from eight to nine --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and actually, I'm the teacher.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I led the class.  I had about nine people --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  -- and after that, then I finished doing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- my --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- thirty laps.
L:  Okay.  So, which is thirty laps, do you go up to and [several inaudible words] -- is that --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- a mile or --
R:  I never --
L:  -- how --
R:  -- even measure.  It takes me about thirty five to forty minutes.  Each time I go across the pool I count it as one.
L:  One, okay.
R:  Yeah, so I --
L:  Well, which doesn't --
R:  -- I really don't know.  Uh, but that's sort of my goal.
L:  What is, um -- now, is that an indoor pool or outdoor pool?
R:  I- it's an indoor pool, it's heated.
L:  Oh, okay, that's, uh --
R:  And it's eighty seven degrees.  It was really hot. [MN]
L:  Okay, yeah, it's nice.
R:  But this evening I went over to the pool across the street and that's an outdoor pool.  The water --
L:  Right.
R:  -- was really refreshing.
L:  Right.
R:  And then the --
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  -- temperature dropped.
L:  I --
R:  What?
L:  Er, okay, so -- so that is like the main thing that -- what you do, though, is you pretty much swim and then you do some cardio, or ...?
R:  Well, uh, let's --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- see.  This week, I -- I rode the bike for half an hour --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  -- but it's a stationary bike.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  And, uh, I went to my daughter's spa with her on Saturday and I, uh, tried one of the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- machines there.  It was kind of like biking and moving your arms at the same time and I think I did that for twenty five minutes.
L:  Huh, okay.  
R:  That was --
L:  Now, did -- did --
R:  -- Friday.
L:  -- did you start working out because, uh, er, were you overweight or is it just something you've always done?
R:  Oh, I've -- all my life I -- I've done that.  I like the water.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And actually you don't lose weight.  You re- --
L:  What --
R:  -- -distribute and you get more muscle and muscle weighs more than flab.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, uh, you know, you don't really lose weight at it.  It's actually -- I got on the scale and said, "Oh, all the exercise I did and I'm a little heavier". [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, well, yeah, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I -- I'm like one of these type of people that'll -- I'll join the health clubs --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and go, you know -- I've done it before, I've joined like maybe three times in my life.  I'm thirty five right now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, y- you know, you usually start out, you'll go, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you're real into it and then after a couple of months, uh, you know, you start to lose interest or whatever.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, I mean, I gained -- I -- I basically joined the health clubs, I mean, primarily 'cause, uh, the meat -- the meat checks --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- basically.  Um, but, uh, I -- I -- I wasn't real --
R:  Do you walk --
L:  -- you know, real into it.
R:  much?  'Cause walking is easiest.
L:  Nah.  No, I'm not rea- -- I'm -- I guess, I'm pretty lucky in the fact that I -- I can eat and I'm not -- you know, I'm getting a little bit flabbier than I was in my twenties --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, uh, [NOISE] you know but I -- I -- I've got bad eating habits.  I'm a salesman and I eat on the road, eat a lot of bad, you know, bad greasy food and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'm like one of these --
R:  Well, when you're --
L:  -- guys that --
R:  -- thirty five, you don't really worry about it.  At -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- at that age, you feel like you're gonna live forever, right?
L:  Right and then, uh, it's [NOISE] gonna sneak up on me one day. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, I happen --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to be seventy two.
L:  Wow.
R:  And --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I -- I went out for the senior games for my senior center --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I won --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ten -- er, I came in -- er, in -- I won ten eve- events.  I came --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- I got fir- -- five first places for swimming, I did the walk around La Salle football field and it's a mile and fourteen minutes.  I came in --
L:  Nice.
R:  -- second on that.
L:  That -- that was just recently, right?  The, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- senior games, right?  Yeah, I --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- I work down at Delaware [NOISE] County [NOISE] and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, I -- I knew there was, uh -- there was something [NOISE] in the Delaware County Times about it.
R:  Oh, uh-huh.  We didn't --
L:  Yeah, 'bout the --
R:  -- really get much --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- publicity in Philadelphia.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  You might want to check out -- maybe you get some -- maybe you got a little write up in the Delaware County Times.  You should, uh --
R:  Oh, maybe. [LAUGH]
L:  Maybe --
R:  Don't --
L:  -- check --
R:  -- know.
L:  -- that out. [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know.  But I got medals for --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it and, uh --
L:  Oh, did ya?  Er --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- that's nice, that's --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- cool.
R:  Yeah, and I got a, uh, a dinner.  They -- they presented the medals at a -- a dinner in a fancy restaurant just --
L:  Where were the --
R:  -- the week ago.
L:  Where were the games held at?
R:  Uh, La Salle football field, uh, La Salle --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- College.
L:  Okay, up in North Philly, right?
R:  And it's -- yeah, yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- West Olney Avenue and the --
L:  Right.
R:  -- swimming was held at Lincoln Pool.  That's a city pool.
L:  Okay.  So --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- it was an outdoor -- was that outdoor or --
R:  That was --
L:  -- indoor?
R:  -- an indoor pool.  Yeah.
L:  Was it --
R:  And you know what?  The -- the swimming was really easy for me 'cause --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- when you're seventy --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- two, there's really not a lot of competition. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  How many people -- how many people were you up against?
R:  Oh, for my age group for swimming, I think I only saw about four people.  But when we --
L:  Four people?
R:  -- did the walk, they had -- it was seventy five people.
L:  Wow.
R:  But they weren't all my age.  Was -- you were --
L:  Right.
R:  -- competing --
L:  It was open --
R:  -- with the same age level.
L:  Right.
R:  And I --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- competed between seventy and seventy four and when I swam, there was a man there from my center, who belonged to senior center and he was ninety five and he won.
L:  Wow.
R:  You know what?  Er, there wasn't anybody over ninety to compete --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- with him. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's, aye -- that's a cool way to win, right?  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, uh --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- he's go- -- he's a winner anyway just by, uh [NOISE] --
R:  That's right, just to make --
L:  -- getting out there and doing that.
R:  Right --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- absolutely.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  He still dances --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and he has a girlfriend.
L:  Nah.  Well, I --
R:  So, how do --
L:  -- know --
R:  -- you like that for exercise? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that is -- I know my great grandmother, she lived, uh -- she was ninety five when she passed away and she used to drink [inaudible] -- or was it -- Carling Black Label.  Every night she used to have about three beers a night and we used to say, uh, she was pickled.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  [LAUGH] You know, that's --
R:  Well, you know --
L:  But --
R:  -- she probably lasted that long 'cause she was a hard worker.
L:  Yeah, she was a hard worker but, uh, I'll tell ya, I really think that some times the -- er, a little bit of, uh, alcohol [NOISE], you know --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- as long as you don't over imbibe, I -- I really --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- think that it does -- they do -- they do say that it, uh [NOISE] -- it helps you with your, um, blood [NOISE] flow and everything like that.
R:  That's right.  It's supposed to be good for your heart.  I did read that.
L:  [NOISE] Something -- I -- I heard something about like the French, with the red wine --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- um --
R:  -- yeah, as long --
L:  -- something to --
R:  -- as you don't overdo it.  I think not more than two a day.
L:  Right an- and that's -- that's what she used -- she would have about two beers a night --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, uh, you know, that -- that [NOISE] -- and -- and [NOISE] -- but she didn't smoke.  That was the main thing, [NOISE] you know, smoking is, uh --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I guess, that -- that really would, you know, kind of --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- knock you out but, uh --
R:  That's true.  But you know, second hand smoke is worse than first hand.
L:  Er, is it really?
R:  I think so, yeah.  I know a lot of people that have dropped over it, that never smoked and ended up with lung cancer.
L:  Oh.
R:  Because other members of the family smoked.
L:  Yeah, I -- I -- I have a girlfriend of mine, she smokes.  She lives --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- in the house with me --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- so --
R:  -- it's --
L:  -- it's --
R:  -- not a good --
L:  -- yeah --
R:  -- thing to do.  And now --
L:  I --
R:  -- even Philip Morris is coming out telling you that, er, it's bad for your health.  Did you hear that last one?
L:  Uh, no, I didn't hear that -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- no.
R:  It was on --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- the TV and the radio and it was sponsored by Philip Morris telling you that smoking was bad for your health.
L:  Yeah, I -- I never -- I never -- I couldn't get into smoking.  I couldn't, so I was pretty lucky --
R:  Well --
L:  -- on that end.
R:  They should've told people that in the fifties.
L:  Yeah --
R:  But they didn't.
L:  -- how 'bout -- how 'bout -- you don't smoke, do you?
R:  Oh, no.  No, I --
L:  No?
R:  -- never smoked.
L:  Never smoked?
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, er, which -- so, do y- -- just, uh -- have you ever -- so, do you belong to a health club right now, or you -- it's pretty --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- much ...
R:  Well, er, I'm a member of this -- of the Y at -- near Nazareth Hospital --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and I joined it because I like the water exercises --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but now that I'm teaching it, I can go for free.
L:  Oh, okay, that's --
R:  So, that --
L:  -- good, so ...
R:  -- that -- and I'm not getting paid for teaching it but there -- er, uh, I'm getting a free membership.  So, that's --
L:  You get the --
R:  -- good.
L:  Yeah, you get the benefit of that, sure.
R:  Yeah, but I'm only teaching it one day a week.  They have a regular teacher the other days but I do --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that about four times a week.
L:  Uh, it sounds like you keep your -- keep yourself active.
R:  Well, you have to.  You know, the old --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- saying, if you don't use it, you lose it.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  I know -- I know my grandfather -- my grandfather, was a longshoreman and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I know when he retired, uh, unfortunately, he pretty much -- you know, he kind of just pretty much sat in his chair and didn't really --
R:  Did he last a year after that?
L:  No, I mean, yeah, he lasted -- he lasted -- he died, uh -- he passed away when he was -- I believe he was seventy five maybe.  So, he was retired for almost thirteen years but, uh, it just seemed like, you know, he kind of -- he -- he got really -- almost got like this, eh, second job or -- you got to -- you know what I mean?  Like, you, er, you know, keep yourself busy.  It's like, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- what was the old saying, idle time is a double workshop for --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, I -- I don't know.  He just seemed like he was sitting in his chair and you know, a lot of his friends were passing away and, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, it's just a sh- -- you know. [NOISE]
R:  My father --
L:  But I -- I -- [NOISE]
R:  -- did that too.  My father lasted to be eighty six but, er, when he retired, he kept getting other jobs --
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  -- a guard, or a -- a hotel or whatever.
L:  Yeah, just --
R:  Easy th- --
L:  -- keeps --
R:  -- er, things but he liked working.
L:  Yeah, keeps him -- keep your mind active --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, uh, you know, everything like.  I mean, I'm --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I -- I hope that when I get up to -- you know, get older, I mean, I hope, you know, once I start seeing, you know, putting some weight on, you know, eventually, you start saying to yourself, "All right, now [LAUGH] I better start getting myself in shape".
