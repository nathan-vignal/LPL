L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, how are you?  This is Vincent.  And you?
L:  I'm Jill.
R:  Jill.  How are you?
L:  I'm fine, how are you doing?
R:  [LAUGH] I'm pretty good.  So, where are you?
L:  I'm in Illinois.
R:  Oh, right, I'm in New York.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  So, some distance.
R:  Yeah.  So, what do you do to --
L:  Um --
R:  -- yeah --
L:  -- to -- to keep fit? [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.
L:  Well, [SIGH] I try to exercise and I go through spurts --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- I do it well for a while and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- then I'll get o- out of the habit and it's really difficult to get back into it, so --
R:  Uh -- do you -- do you have a gym membership?
L:  Um, I'm -- I'm a university student, so I have a gym --
R:  Aha.  Well --
L:  -- as part of the university, which is convenient --
R:  Yeah, same here.  I mean, just --
L:  -- oh, okay.
R:  -- yeah and I pay a lot of money for it, but [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, do you? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I -- I go to NYU and it's very, very expensive, but --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- uh, yeah, they do have a good gym but I don't really -- I don't really go there, but, um, yeah, anyway, I do --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- I do work out but I m- mostly just work out at home and so I can watch television and work out at the same time, so I don't feel like I'm wasting time. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You're watching TV, so it's --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- not a waste of time?
R:  -- so I'm watching The Simpsons and I'm doing situps and, you know, uh, so, that's --
L:  Well --
R:  -- good.
L:  -- that works out pretty well then, you don't find that you just come home and want to sit on the couch and not do anything?
R:  Yeah, yeah, so I was just watching TV and doing situps and yeah.  Which --
L:  Well --
R:  -- is --
L:  -- that's not too bad.
R:  -- it works for me. [LAUGH]
L:  You have better motivation than I do, 'cause if I try to do it on my own --
L:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I have a tendency to just decide that I'm too tired --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- though I've been trying to go to classes because I think it's good to have somebody standing in front of me motivating me --
R:  Yes, yes.  And --
L:  -- and they can't really -- you can't really quit 'cause you're too tired, it's -- it's too embarrassing to do that, so --
R:  [LAUGH] Have you been [MN] any of the -- tho- those classes, or your aerobics or whatever, dancing or tae kwon --
L:  Ye-
R:  -- do or whatever? [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, some aerobics classes and I did kickboxing for a while, which --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- actually that was kinda fun.
R:  Uh-huh, Tae bo, that kind of stuff?
L:  Yeah, that kind of thing.  So you feel kind of, um --
R:  Uh-huh.  Have you done yoga before?
L:  I haven't and I've heard really good things about it.
R:  Uh-huh.  I tried once and, you know, that's my first yoga and last c- yoga class, because I --
L:  Oh, you didn't like it, huh?
R:  Uh, um, I -- I think I pushed myself too hard and I -- I was trying, like, very, very difficult position and, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, yeah, I [MN] sort of hurt myself --
L:  Oh no.
R:  -- yeah.  And, um, [LIPSMACK] well, anyway. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I was trying, like, upside down and doing, like, s- what they call the scorpion position or whatever and, um, but, yeah, I shouldn't do that, I'm just beginner, that's my --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that was my first class, so, but I was -- I was too a- ambitious, so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- yeah.
L:  So, did -- did you know as soon as you did it that you had -- had pulled something or hurt --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- yourself, or did it take till the next day?
R:  The next --
L:  'Cause --
R:  -- day.
L:  Yeah, I always --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- hear people say that they go to a yoga class and then --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the next day they realize that what --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- yeah.
R:  Yes.  And who said that, [MN] the, uh, it's not an exercise, it is. [LAUGH] It's --
L:  Yeah, well, that's what some people tell me, I believe them, 'cause I have some friends who are in very good shape and they--
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- oftentimes go to yoga and then --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- come back sore.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.  And --
L:  So --
R:  -- are you, I mean, in terms of diet wise, are you on certain particular diet or you're just --
L:  Well, let's see --
R:  -- everything goes. [LAUGH]
L:  -- I -- [LAUGH] everything is probably a good word, I -- I try to make sure that it's balanced, so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it -- I try to, you know, eat a lot of salad and fruits and vegetables, but unfortunately I really enjoy eating --
R:  [LAUGH] Me too.
L:  -- so I -- I just eat a lot. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  And what kind of food do you like?
L:  Um, I like everything, I mean --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I -- I really enjoy good fruits, especially in the summer, because the --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- rest of the year around here the -- the fruits and vegetables are tasteless --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so that's kind of depressing, but, um, that and -- and soup and sandwiches and dessert, I do like dessert quite a bit --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I like sweets.  So --
R:  Do you like eth-
L:  -- that's kind of a problem.
R:  -- ethnic food?
L:  Yes.  Um, almost any kind of food. [LAUGH]
R:  Huh.  Good --
L:  So --
R:  -- good.
L:  -- I enjoy -- I used to live in Houston and it was really nice because they had quite a bit of --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- different ethnic restaurants, I love Indian food.
R:  Uh-huh.  Oh yeah, I love Indian food too.
L:  It's -- it's yummy stuff.
R:  [LAUGH]  Whi- uh, which university you go to?
L: University of Illinois.
R:  Oh, okay.  And --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that's -- I have no idea where that is, but --
L:  It's --
R:  -- it's in --
L:  -- it's in Champaign, Urbana, it's not -- not a well known location.
R:  Uh-huh, okay.
L:  Uh --
R:  And it's --
L:  Kind of in the middle --
R:  -- cold in --
L:  -- of the state.
R:  -- in the winter?  And --
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Very cold.
R:  And what do you study?
L:  Um, I'm getting a doctorate in electrical engineering, actually.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  [MN]
R:  Wow.  That's an interesting -- interesting field for --
L:  Yes, hopefully someday I'll finish.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We'll see.
R:  And yo- you pretty much finished, or are you just started?
L:  No, I've been here a few years, I'm getting close to finishing --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- so --
R:  Uh --
R:  -- and what about you, what are you studying?
R:  Well, I'm doing my PhD in international education, so --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- yeah, I go to NYU, so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- yeah and, uh, I -- I pretty much finish all my course work, but now I'm sort of taking a break from school and, um [SIGH] --
L:  Oh, okay, that sounds nice.
R:  -- yeah, because, you know, it's -- it's -- it's such a headache to -- to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- start with my dissertation project and, um, I just want to take a break, been school too long, yeah.
L:  I understand.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]
R:  Uh, I bet -- I bet you do. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I do. [LAUGH]
R:  So, do you have a, mm, a dissertation topic, or --
L:  Yeah, I have an area that I'm working in --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's -- it's not entirely clear which parts of the research will work out and which ones won't, so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- everything --
R:  So, what do you --
L:  -- I --
R:  -- so, what do you think this project is about? [LAUGH]
L:  It's, um, hopefully it's -- it's on, like, quality of service for cellular networks --
R:  Huh --
L:  -- so --
R:  -- really? [LAUGH]
L:  -- yeah.
R:  Uh, uh, you --
L:  Hah.
R:  -- think U Penn would do that? [LAUGH] I don't know.
L:  Mm.
R:  Probably -- I was thinking about maybe something like, how long till s- you know, that two stranger can stay on a topic. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, well, we screwed that up, didn't we?
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I think we did pretty well. [LAUGH]
L:  We did well for a while --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- this is a better topic, every now and then it's something that, you know, you can only discuss for five minutes and then it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- pretty much gone.
R:  I know.  And --
L:  But I can spend a long time complaining about how much I enjoy eating.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, that's part of the health and fitness, so, yeah --
L:  I suppose, I have friends who -- who really don't like to eat and they only do it because it's necessary and I think they're nuts.
R:  Oh, uh, one of those people.
L:  It must be a whole different lifestyle.
R:  Uh-huh, yeah, I know.  But I love eating, so -- and I'm --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, um, well, ethnic wise I'm Chinese, so, you know --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- you know our reputation, we eat everything and anything so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I guess.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I have an office mate who's Chinese and she's actually exceptionally picky --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so, I hadn't thought about it, but you're right, typically.
R:  Yeah, they are typically, yeah.
L:  But, yeah, the stereotype is that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- eat anything.
R:  Well.  How lo- how -- how many calls do you -- you have made?
L:  Not a whole lot, I think this is, like, my fourth.
R:  Can you make more than three?  I -- I -- I don't know that, wow.
L:  Oh, I thought -- you know, I thought you could, but maybe it's only my third.  I don't count very well.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, because I -- I -- well, anyway, this is my second phone call, so --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- anyway.  And I hope this is not a scam or anything, but --
L:  No, I actually got a check. [LAUGH]
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, I did, so it's not a scam.
R:  Oh, great. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I feel much, much --
L:  Good news --
R:  -- better now.
L:  -- huh?
R:  [LAUGH] I feel much, much better now.
L:  Yeah, I hope that that makes your day. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, that just -- you just made my day.  My night --
L:  I wondered --
R:  -- actually, wha- what's that?
L:  -- that's right.  I wondered if it was ever going to come through and then I opened something up in the mail and it was like, "Oh look".
R:  So, this thing is -- have -- has been [MN] going on for a while?
L:  [MN]
R:  I -- I assume.
L:  When did I -- I think I got an original message about it maybe in February or March.
R:  Oh, really?  So, wow --
L:  And -- yeah, so I signed up way back then, but it was quite a while before I got any calls.
R:  Okay.  So you --
L:  I think maybe May or so --
R:  I see.  Do you just wait --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- for the phone call or you actually make the phone call?
L:  No, you just wait.
R:  Oh, okay.  Actually I just, I -- I can't wait, I just keep, I just call. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And put in my pin number, yeah.
L:  I didn't know you could do that.
R:  I think it's --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- well, I hope I'm doing --
L:  You did right?
R:  -- the right thing --
L:  So it works.
R:  -- why -- I did, yeah, so, we'll see.  Maybe this doesn't count, but anyway --
L:  I'm sure it does.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I spent -- I remember reading an email they sent out recently that they really needed male voices, so --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- I think they'll -- they'll count whatever you do because --
R:  Oh, yeah, because the -- the message you got is actually, they have, like extra incentives to -- for you to, um, refer male friends --
L:  Yeah, yeah --
R:  -- so --
L:  -- that's why --
R:  -- yeah.
L:  -- 'cause they don't have enough men, I guess women are --
R:  Talkative.
L:  -- either -- talkative --
R:  -- stereotypical way.
L:  -- right, or they're --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or they're just more likely to respond to this sort of thing.
R:  Uh-huh.  Where -- where --
L:  I don't know --
R:  -- did y-
L:  -- I thought they'd just get lots of engineers, 'cause we're all well known for doing anything for money. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Why --
L:  I was surprised not to have more friends doing the same sort of thing.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, wow.  Ha- di- did you talk to anyone you know?
L:  No --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- no.
R:  Okay, most of them are from, I guess, New York or, yeah --
L:  Trying to think --
R:  -- West Coast, or --
L:  -- somebody from St Louis --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and then I think the other person, so I must have only had two, the other person was, like, from Iowa, so they were both --
R:  Oh, it's actually --
L:  -- Midwest.
R:  -- everywhere.  Wow.
L:  Yeah --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- you're the first ...
