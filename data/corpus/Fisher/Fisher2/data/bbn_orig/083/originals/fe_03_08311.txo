R:  Hello.
L:  [NOISE] I didn't think that anybody would be home this late.
R:  [LAUGH] It's, uh, yeah. [LAUGH] I'm used to working; that's why.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, yeah, so the topic is what; censorship of books for public school kids?
L:  Yeah.  The courts would rule, uh, yes because the school; it's a limited forum[?].  It's not a forum that's covered by the first amendment.
R:  What do you mean, it's covered by the first amendment?  Like, I mean, they could -- they could control what --
L:  Yeah, the te- --
R:  -- the kids read while they're in school --
L:  Yeah, the --
R:  -- but not like --
L:  -- [inaudible] because the case when a few years ago; if you remember [several inaudible words] to the Supreme Court.  I even go -- the Chief Justice [inaudible] was a -- a -- a -- a journalist.  He favored the school administration that they could censor.  They don't have to have --
R:  That they could censor; but that does that mean everything that --
L:  And everything but --
R:  -- the kids read?  I mean --
L:  [inaudible] and things, uh, like they could censor like dirty words or something like hate speech or something like that.
R:  Wow.  But that's -- I mean, the problem is that they could only control what the kids read while they're in school.  I mean, they could --
L:  That's --
R:  -- never have -- they could never any -- exercise any authority over what they read outside of school or anything like that.
L:  That's the parents' place to do that. [NOISE] 
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah, that's up -- up to the parents.  But the main thing is that -- that I will go along with the courts that even in prison like if you in prison they have the right to search.  They're not covered by the first amendment.  You know -- you know, they don't need a search warrant.  If you -- if you a prisoner they can censor things too.  Like the prison newspaper, uh, you -- you lose some rights when you in prison.
R:  Really?
L:  They could search your cell.  They could search your -- your place where -- where police they have to get a search --
R:  But are they allowed to search like kids' school bags in school and stuff like that.  I mean, don't they --
L:  Oh, they allowed.  Because I tell you why.  Uh, when I went to school I'm -- I'm -- I'm older than most people.  They have that -- that Latin word, in loco  parentis; in place of the parents.  The -- the teachers have a lot --
R:  Are set[?] as guidance.
L:  -- to say, yes.  And -- and -- and -- and even in college, uh, they have censorship and 'cause, uh, you know, search for marijuana.
R:  Really?  Well, I remember in college that like, uh, security would come to the door and like you would let them in.  But I mean, I don't know if -- I mean, they never asked to search my room or anything like that and even if they did I don't think that like I would have[?].  You know what I mean?  I'm not sure what I would've said.  I wouldn't have agreed.  You know what I mean?
L:  But you know -- but they h- -- but the courts ruled that they would have a right to do it because, uh, because you go to school this and that.  You -- you have less rights than in places like in a house.  In a house --
R:  So, even -- so like even in a dorm room -- 'cause the way that we understood it; at least like, you know, freshman year in college you have things in your room you're not supposed to have so the way that we understood it is that as long as it was not out then it's not like security could like search you.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  I don't have the experiences but I know that in a private house, not a dorm room, but in a private house the fourth amendment a- applies.  You know what I mean?
R:  The fourth amendment which means --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that no sear- -- no legal search --
L:  Uh, yeah.
R:  -- without a warrant.
L:  But -- except for a car because a car's a movable thing, a car they could search quicker.  They don't need a warrant so much with a car because it's a movable object.  So, the ca- --
R:  They don't need a warrant to search your car at all?  I mean, like if somebody says -- I mean, they can search your car any time?  You can't refuse it period?
L:  No, no.  They have to have probable cause or something.
R:  Probably cause.  So, technically like if you refused --
L:  I --
R:  I mean, it would just be a problem for you 'cause they would just impound your car then.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, something like that because that went to the courts too.  I remember a few years ago about a car.  Originally they need their search warrant for a car but the High Court ruled that because a car is not a home it -- it don't come under that protection o- of the fourth amendment that much.
R:  It doesn't really count as private property?  I mean --
L:  It'd be semi private or something.  Like -- like in a hallway.  If you in a hallway of an apartment house it's trespassing but it's not as serious as you trespassing in somebody's house.  You know.  But if you in the hall like in -- on the roof or you in the -- in the stair --
R:  'Cause it's still somewhat public?
L:  Yeah, it's semi public.  So, the cops they could search you or they could give you a -- my house they give you a summons.  They give you like a C summons.  They -- they won't lock you up but they can give you a C summons that you -- that you trespassing like in the second degree or something.
R:  In the second degree.  I didn't know they had degrees of trespassing.
L:  Oh, yeah.  It -- w- where you from?  What State?
R:  I'm in Florida.
L:  Oh, that's why.  Florida has different laws.  Like --
R:  Where are you?
L:  Texas has the same thing too.  Like --
R:  In where?  Sorry.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Where are you?
L:  I'm in New York City.
R:  Oh, in New York City.  Okay, cool.
L:  So, the laws are different.  Like down there you have capital murder.  We call it first degree murder.  There and Texas it's capital murder.  But it's the same +equivalent.  It, you know, like some places don't have rape they have sexual abuse, sexual congress[?] or something.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Oh -- oh, and Spanish countries they call it violation: valadore[?].
R:  Oh, yeah, really?
L:  Yeah.  See every country -- every country or State they make their own local laws.  I wanna ask you; in Florida what is the age of consent for sex?  Here it's seventeen or sixteen or something.
R:  It's eighteen.
L:  Fifteen?
R:  It's eighteen.
L:  Wow.  Here it's seventeen.
R:  Wow.
L:  See, and some --
R:  Is it?  How -- uh, how young is it in other -- is it as young as like fifteen in other places or ?
L:  Yes.  In Mormon States like in Utah a girl fourteen or fifteen, or a man, could get married but they need their -- the consent of their -- either the parents or Family Court Judge.
R:  So, that's to get married.  Okay.
L:  That's -- 'cause actually --
R:  Yeah, 'cause I -- yeah --
L:  -- if you get married it means that you're consenting to sexual relations.  You know what I'm saying?
R:  Yeah.  I think that it's eighteen here.  I'm pretty sure.
L:  Some States like New Jersey it's -- it's the same thing.  Ev- -- like I say, every State makes their own rules so it's a har- -- like owning a gun.  In Florida I know you're allowed to own a gun easy.  In New York City you're not allowed to own a gun easy.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  What city in Florida are you from?
R:  I'm in, uh, Miami.  So I'm like way -- one[?] way south.
L:  I like Tampa because --
R:  Tampa? [LAUGH]
L:  [inaudible] Florida but I wanna go to Tampa.  I -- I wanna see the house that Thomas Edison built[?].  He lived there as a summer house.
R:  Oh, yeah?  Is that there?
L:  Yeah.  It's on the west coast of Florida.
R:  Oh, my god.  I don't think I've ever visited there but I've never really spent much time on the west coast of Florida.
L:  [inaudible] like Saint Petersburg.  People -- they t- -- [MN] tend to go to Flor- -- are you Jewish?
R:  No.  But, um, I know there's, you know, large Jewish communities like --
L:  Yeah, the Miami Be- --
R:  -- in Fort Lauderdale.
L:  Miami Beach.
R:  And I'm Asian actually. [LAUGH] 
L:  English?
R:  Asian. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.  'Cause I went down to Florida and I'm older than you.  Nineteen fifty two I went down there.
R:  Wow.
L:  They had segregation.  When I went --
R:  And they had segregation still?
L:  Yeah.  At that --
R:  Yeah.  Okay listen.  I had a very, uh, I had a boyfriend much older than me.
L:  Oh.
R:  And, um, yeah, he was in like -- he was like in his teens and it must've been I guess like in the sixties when they finally got rid of segregation.
L:  I went down in the fifties.
R:  When they desegregated the, um --
L:  Schools.
R:  -- schools.  When they integrated the schools.
L:  Yes.
R:  It was like -- it must've been in the sixties already.
L:  Yes.
R:  Late sixties even.  Wow.  Mid -- late sixties.
L:  It depends upon where you're from.  Little Rock they did it in fifty seven, fifty eight.  E- --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Every place is different.  You know what I mean?
R:  Wow.
L:  I -- that's why a lot of people don't like the United States.  The law's not the same in all parts of the country.  Like --
R:  No.  But that's what's so cool about the United States too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, you got -- you just have so much diversity.
L:  Yeah.  But sometimes you better than [inaudible] if you're liberal.  Like I'm liberal with sex.  I like Holland[?], Belgium.  The small countries like Switzerland they're very liberal with sex.  If you go with something and this and that they look the other way.  It's illegal but they don't enforce the law.  You know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.  I don't know.  Like I think that people here have a lot of hang ups as far as --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- sex, nudity, nakedness --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in general.  I mean, in compares in other countries --
L:  I lived e- -- 
R:  It's just absolutely ridiculous.
L:  I agree.  I live -- there's a nude beach for --
R:  What was it that news -- on the news today?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I saw -- today on the news I saw a pool had opened up.  It's a nude pool for people -- for kids like eleven to eighteen.
L:  Ugh.  I --
R:  It -- it was the [inaudible] thing.  Like I don't even know how to take that.
L:  But it's okay because where I live too they had a nude beach and they made a big fuss about the nude beach so they closed it down.
R:  Wow.
L:  It's silly 'cause on the beach people wear a thong, people wear little bikinis, so they're almost naked.  Well, what's the -- if they just take off everything that they're nearly naked anyhow.
R:  I know.  I don't get what the difference is.  It doesn't make any -- it does -- it has no point at all.  Like --
L:  I know.
R:  I'm not sure how it is on the topless beach down here but I'm sure that --
L:  If -- if you're old enough you could remember, even men never went topless.  Men had to wear a tank top.
R:  Well, that I'm definitely not old enough for. [LAUGH]
L:  Grandfather's swim suit.  My grandfather was born in eighteen nineties and -- and the men always wore --
R:  That's right.  I remember the pictures.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I remember all the photos; all the black and white photos.
L:  Yeah.
R:  All the men have the striped tank tops.
L:  Yes, yes.  A- a- and men wore a tank top and women wore bloomers or something.  I remember my grandmother telling me --
R:  What's bloomers?
L:  And some people because you don't know 'cause see you're not religious.  In some places men and women bathed separately.
