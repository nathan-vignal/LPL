L:  Hi, my name's Brenda.
R:  Hi, Brenda, I'm Kelly.
L:  Hi, how you doing.
R:  Pretty good.  I think this is one of the better topics.
L:  I've had one that was pretty bad but this is good. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, oh, I had one on reality TV, um, I ran out of stuff to say after two minutes. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I had one on something, I can't even remember now but, um, anyways [LAUGH] whe- where do you live?
R:  I live in Boston.
L:  Uh, I live in, um, Tampa, Florida.
R:  Oh.
L:  Pretty different.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, uh --
R:  So, do you work out? [LAUGH]
L:  I am -- uh, physically I'm unable to.
R:  Mm.
L:  I -- I cannot walk for a long distances, um, I can walk probably about five to ten feet.
R:  Mm.
L:  And, um, so although walking is a great exercise I can't do that anymore.
R:  Wow.
L:  So, I have to find different ways of doing it, like, um, learning how to lift weights --
R:  Oh, so --
L:  -- with the upper body.
R:  -- you can do, like, upper body stuff.
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  And, um, I need arm strength --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- badly.
L:  Um, but I'm trying to look into working at, um, requirements for a wheelchair race.
R:  Oh cool.
L:  And that kind of thing so, um, do a little -- gonna start maybe, um, uh, [NOISE] what is it called [NOISE], it's, um, [NOISE] it's kinda boxing you do -- you ever seen it, they have the bag up above and they hit it?
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  I don't know what's that called --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- um --
R:  -- like a punching bag.
L:  Yeah.  It's not a punching bag, it's -- actually, a [NOISE] punching bag is long [NOISE] --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and -- and heavy but --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- it's smaller.
R:  -- a heavy bag.
L:  Yeah, so ...
R:  Yeah, a friend of mine actually has one of those in her basement.
L:  We're gonna, um, try put to that one up in a -- in a few weeks and I'm ready to start working out with that.
R:  Oh cool, it should help you with stress too. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Yeah, I -- I get angry, I go out there and punch it.
R:  Yeah, you'll feel better.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Um, so --
R:  Yeah, I belong to a gym now.  I've had some physical issues too.  I've had a lot of knee problems so --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it was really tough to -- to get started once I'd had surgery and everything --
L:  Oh wow.
R:  -- to -- to fix things up but -- but getting back into it -- by then the muscles in my legs were shot so --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it was kinda hard to get started but -- but it feels good now.
L:  [LAUGH] What kind of things are you doing?
R:  Uh, I just joined a women's gym, um, which is cool, which is kind of a different -- different feeling, different environment --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- from a mixed gym.  Um --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- there are a couple of classes I do like weight training --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- uh, I've tried spinning but that's pretty hard [LAUGH].
L:  What's that?
R:  It's, um, they're stationary bikes but it's a special kind of stationary bike and it's done in a class so there's a teacher on a bike in front of you and maybe ten or twenty people on stationary bikes around you and she gives different directions, like, go faster or go slower or --
L:  Whoa.
R:  -- get up out of the seat and peddle.
L:  I've never heard of that.
R:  Yeah, it's -- it's kinda popular around here at least.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Kinda of a --
L:  Well --
R:  -- trendy thing but it hurts [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Uh, most exercise hurts.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I did yoga for a while though.  I like that a lot.
L:  Is that considered exercise?
R:  Yeah, it really is.
L:  [MN] Cool.
R:  It really is, so it's -- um, it just goes much better with my personality.  I'm not -- I hated sports, I hated gym class --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- when I was growing up.  It was just awful.  But, um, yoga was good 'cause it helped me gain a lot of strength.
L:  Was it good for your knees?
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, and real low stress.  Like, low impact.  So, it didn't -- you know, no quick movements --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- no pounding movements, it was all really controlled.
L:  [NOISE] Sounds like no jerking movements either.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly, so -- yeah, I --
L:  So, it's --
R:  -- think it's exercise -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you can do some good strength training there.
L:  Mm. [SIGH] I don't, um -- never thought of it as exercise, I thought of it as -- I always think of mediation but not exercise, you know.
R:  Yeah, some of it but some of it, you know, when you're -- they're doing handstands or crazy back bends or --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or things --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- like that then [LAUGH] -- then you work on your strength, that's not cardiovascular, you don't really get your heart pumping, um, most of the time but -- but it's strength --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- training.
L:  That -- that should help with your, uh, um -- help with your, uh, health though.
R:  Yeah, oh definitely.
L:  So, I guess, it's [NOISE] I don't know, um --
R:  Definitely good for stress reduction [LAUGH] too.  And that's half --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of why I exercise, just to feel better, like, mentally.
L:  [NOISE] I heard something that relieving the [NOISE] stress helps you physically anyway.
R:  Oh, I believe it.
L:  [NOISE] Like, have you ever tried, um -- I -- I used to like biking.  I guess that's maybe why I'm thinking about the wheelchair racing. [NOISE]
R:  Mm.
L:  And I don't know if I can bike anymore.  I got sick almost two years ago and I've just started recently thinking about into it and, you know, actually gonna start doing it and I've done some light training with, uh, the, um, wheelchair but, um [NOISE] -- I've lost my train of thought, hold on.
R:  Okay. [LAUGH]
L:  Um, oh I -- I liked biking.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I had thoughts of even training for racing bikes but I think that kind goes in hand and hand, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I can't -- I don't know if my legs can do biking anymore.
R:  Yeah, definitely, but as long as your arms are --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- are getting in good shape.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, they've got some wild contraptions for wheelchairs.  You can do bicycling on, um -- with wheelchairs with your hands.
R:  Yeah, I've seen those.  The, uh, Boston Marathon --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- up here has a wheelchair race.
L:  Oh.  That's so cool.
R:  Yeah, it is -- it's really cool, um, so you see a lot of these crazy hi tech chairs for racing, they're amazing.
L:  Do you, um, do you go to the marathons much or anything like that?
R:  I've -- I've gone once.  I follow it, I like to see who wins, you know, but, um, it's so crowded for it [LAUGH].
L:  Really.
R:  Yeah, I was lucky enough to watch it from someone's apartment --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- um, once and didn't have to deal with the crowds at all but, yeah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- things get a little crazy.
L:  Have you ever tried running or anything like that?
R:  Uh-uh.  No way [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No way.
L:  Too hard for you?
R:  No way, I'm still not in that kinda shape.
L:  [LAUGH] Do you do any walking?
R:  I'll stick to bikes [LAUGH].
L:  Stick to bikes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] That's cool. [NOISE] Um --
R:  So, how would you start training for wheelchair racing?  Is there a group or would you do --
L:  Um --
R:  -- um, like physical therapy to start or something like that?
L:  [SIGH] Kind of, um, what I've done is internet research and, um, learned the equipment and what I would need and, um, that kind of thing and [NOISE] also with, um -- I found a website that tells me what kind of training I can do --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- um, to build the strength, um, 'cause I will need strength in my arms and my, you know, upper body, basically from my waist up --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- my back and shoulders and neck, actually.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Um, learning, um, you've ridden a bike, right?  You just sit there, right?
R:  Yeah. 
L:  But, think about, when you're riding a bike, um, I know the peddling is done with the wheels or, um, with your feet but, um, when you -- when hold that you have to hold your neck a certain, right?
R:  Mm, yeah.
L:  So, you -- I have to have the strength to keep my head up to keep going 'cause if I put it down then I -- you know, I won't know where I'm going and I might crash or something.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, that kind of thing.  And, um, most of the stuff I've done so far is research but, um, got hand weights, um, dumbbells.
R:  Oh cool.
L:  I've got three pound, five pound, ten pound d- dumbbells where I can start, um, with some real basic simple things, like, three or four times a week and then, um, going around my neighborhood was a first suggestion and, um, right now where I'm living it's not a good place but where I'm moving to in about a couple of weeks is a great place, so the first suggestion is go around in your neighborhood, which I'm gonna start to do, um, and always make sure I have somebody with me at first.
R:  Yeah, just in case.
L:  And, um -- 'cause I don't think I'm gonna make [LAUGH] all the way around to begin with --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- so I'll need somebody to push me back. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or I could just sit there for, like, two or three hours like [MN] in Florida heat I would die.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um -- and then after that, after I build my strength up and my endurance up I graduate to, um, like, a track.  Working on track.
R:  Oh yeah.  Wow.
L:  And then do that -- that's basically -- and there's a, um -- there's a park here that has, um, uh, a track -- not a track but a ...
