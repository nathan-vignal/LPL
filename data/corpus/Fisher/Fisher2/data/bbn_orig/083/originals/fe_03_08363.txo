R:  Hello, my name is --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- Kelvin Williams.
L:  Hi, my name is Julie and I'm in Wisconsin.  Where are you at?
R:  New York City.
L:  New York City, huh.  Is it hot out there today?
R:  Yeah, it was.  It has cooled down now, I think it's gonna rain.
L:  Yeah, it finally cooled off here in Wisconsin too, so we can enjoy it.  So, the topic is exercise.  Do you exercise regularly?
R:  Oh, I -- my s- -- my idea of exercise is going for long walks.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Uh, but I -- I generally don't -- I -- I don't do push-ups or anything like that.
L:  Yeah, me neither. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I get my exercise taking care of the kids and the garden and the yard and all of that good stuff, that --
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  -- it doesn't leave much time for structured exercise, I guess you could say.
R:  Right.  I done that, 'cause I do a lot of, um -- uh, I go to school a lot, trying to learn about, um, health -- health.  The Department of Health's got a program up here.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I'm trying to learn how to take better care and stuff.  So, I do, from different days -- days, um, we go to different places.
L:  Oh, that's interesting.
R:  Yeah, so, it takes a lot of walking since, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, what --
R:  Um --
L:  -- kind of different places do you go to?
R:  Well, right -- right now, I'm in the Bronx and sometime I have to go to another part of New York we call Manhattan.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Got to walk from here to Manhattan [NOISE], or, [several inaudible words] --
L:  Well --
R:  -- these are --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [inaudible] that we talk about.
L:  How far -- how far of a distance is that?
R:  Oh, shoo, man, [LAUGH] 'bout --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- oh, it's a while. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you'll all see, er, you got- -- you gotta walk from -- I'm One Hundred Seventy Street, so I walk from a Hundred Seventy Street down to a Hundred and Twenty Fifth Street, uh --
L:  Uh, that's quite a distance.
R:  Yeah, and then there's another [inaudible], you gotta cross a bridge and -- and go over somewhere else.  So, how 'bout you?
L:  Oh, I live, um, kind of in a ruler -- rural area.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, I mean, we just have lots of farmland around here and --
R:  Oh, that sounds great.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yah, it's nice, that's for sure. [LAUGH]
R:  Quiet, right?
L:  Yes, it's very quiet.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Very quiet, which is very nice.  You know, you have your windows open and you listen to the birds sing and [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Hm.
L:  Yes, all of that good stuff and we got a couple of bear that are on the same block just down --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- the road from us, a couple of hundred feet, so you watch out for them and --
R:  Oh, yeah.  They attack for no reason?
L:  Pardon?
R:  Do they attack for no reason?
L:  No, generally not, no.  The only time you have to watch is if, um, it would be a mother that would have a baby with her --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- then you have to be a little, you know -- then you've got to be cautious because then they --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- then they will, just to protect their young, so ...
R:  Ooh [NOISE].  So, what do you all do at night?  You all going home early, right?
L:  Well, actually I am home. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, inside the house.
L:  [MN]
R:  Before dark and stuff, right?
L:  Oh, yeah.  Well, we don't let it bother us actually.  We just -- you just continue as you always have.  I mean, the bears probably more afraid of you than we are of it, so ...
R:  Oh.  So --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- wh- what do ya -- what do ya do down there -- what do you all do down there?
L:  Pardon?
R:  What do you do down there, um, for -- for -- for recreation?
L:  For recreation.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, we like to swim in the local river. [LIPSMACK]
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah and I go out and I shoot baskets with my kids and, um, I garden, so there's running the tiller and the weeds and then we have a big lawn that we mow and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]
R:  That sounds like fun.
L:  Yeah, never a dull moment --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that's for sure.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Well, here, uh -- uh, all we gotta do, is study, 'cause if you hang out with the wrong kind of company, okay, easy to get yourself in trouble.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I was in New York City, um -- [LIPSMACK] oh, let's see what year was that?  Two -- ninety nine, I think it was.
R:  It got worse since then.  I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- everything is killing everything up here.  So, you got to be very careful.
L:  Yeah.
R:  There's drugs and alcohol -- alc- -- drugs and it's everywhere out here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And every day, you turn around, you hear on the news somebody getting killed or robbed --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or something.
L:  Yeah, that's really scary.  How --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- do you -- how do you manage to live with that kind of stress?
R:  Well, I just keep my mind on what I'm doing, if something's gonna happen, it's gonna happen but anything's gonna happen to me because I've [NOISE] become involved with it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But that's why I go to school and trying to learn something that'll give me some good education, so I could, um, get the heck out of here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it's not exactly my place to live either.  It was a nice place to visit but that was enough. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right, right, right.
L:  Yeah.  Have you ever belonged to a health club?
R:  Health club?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yes, um, well, I was with, um, PAL.  I used to go PAL [NOISE].  That's called Police Athletics League.
L:  Okay.  I've --
R:  They --
L:  -- never heard of that.
R:  Yeah, they -- they -- I used to, um, coach kids there.  I used to go there.  Um --
L:  What did you coach the kids in?
R:  It's a -- a gymnasium.  
L:  Okay.
R:  Well, we coached teenage, um, kids that we try and keep out of trouble.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, we take them and let them go to, um, exercise, climb ropes, go swimming some times.
L:  Oh, that's neat.
R:  Yeah, but I had, um -- I hurt my shoulder.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, I've had to stop doing that, so I -- that's why I've resigned to walking now.
L:  Okay.
R:  'Cause I've -- [NOISE] I pulled my shoulder --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- trying to lift stuff -- my shoulder and my back.
L:  Uh-huh.  Well, that's no good.  Those are painful.
R:  Hell, yeah,
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] How 'bout you?
L:  [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] No, out here, um -- [LIPSMACK] uh, have you ever heard of Curves For Women?
R:  Curds?
L:  It -- Curves For Women.  It's a health club for women.
R:  Right.
L:  But the closest one is thirty miles away, so that, you know ...
R:  I hope you got a car.
L:  [LAUGH] Pardon?
R:  I hope you have a car.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah, we have a car but I don't belong to it, I'd --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- say.  You know, by the time you run that thirty miles and then you put in an hour up there and then you run back home, you know, it's -- it's --
R:  You jog?
L:  -- just too much time out of the day.
R:  Do you jog up there?
L:  I don't jog, no.
R:  Oh, no.
L:  No.  We don't really have a lot of joggers around here.  We do have, um, quite a few walkers and --
R:  Uh.
L:  -- kids that like to ride their bikes.
R:  Right.  Oh.  You all ride that far though?
L:  What was that?
R:  You ride that far?
L:  Do I ride bike?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  That --
L:  -- occasionally. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That far though?
L:  [LAUGH] That far?  No, no way, uh-huh.
R:  Hm.  It's hot down there too, right?
L:  Yeah, it has been warm.  We finally cooled off, um -- yesterday was the first cool day we had.  Otherwise, yeah, I've had the air conditioning running because it was so hot but ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Now we got the windows open and now it's quite pleasant out.  I think we had a high of maybe sixty five today, so ...
R:  Very hot.
L:  No, I said a high.
R:  Oh -- oh --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- high, oh, oh.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, a high. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  No, to me, that's just right --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I like that kind of weather.
R:  Yeah, well, it just cooled off here like twenty minutes ago.  It was -- we've been having like one of those in the high in the nineties and one oh one and stuff like that.
L:  Oh, that's got to be miserable there in the city 'cause you don't get any kind of breeze or anything, do ya?
R:  No and sure don't.  Especially if you got to get out.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  We should carry your air conditioner with you.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH], there you go --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  That wouldn't be too good for your back though, I don't think. [LAUGH]
R:  No, it --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- wouldn't but since --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- since I was hot, whether to breath or to suffer pain, I don't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- know.
L:  Exactly.  Yeah.  So, do you have a family?
R:  Um, yes, I do.  They --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um -- in, um, South Carolina.
L:  Oh, they're in South Carolina --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- okay.
R:  Um, but they -- they, um -- see, my mother [NOISE] died, so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they -- so, when she died, um, you know how family separates.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I ha- -- I don't hear them -- I don't hear from them much.
L:  Oh, that's too bad.
R:  Yeah, but I hear from them, like maybe once every six months, or something like that.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But they -- they -- they still haven't noticed -- still remember who I am.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But far as, um, they haven't special occasions and gatherings and stuff like that, we don't do that.
L:  No, huh?
R:  No.
L:  Oh, that's sad.
R:  [NOISE] 'Cause they don't want to come here and I don't want to go there. [NOISE]
L:  No, huh?
R:  No.
L:  Is that where you grew up, then, was in ...?
R:  No, I'm born from -- I'm from Harlem, New York.
L:  Okay.
R:  I never left New York.
L:  You didn't leave New York?
R:  No.  I --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I like it here, I love it here.
L:  You do, huh?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  'Cause this -- this is my home.  It's the only home I know.
L:  Yah, that's true.
R:  This is right.
L:  Yah, you'd get out here in the country where I live and you wouldn't know what to do with yourself.  You'd probably be bored to crazy, so ...
R:  Yeah [several inaudible words].  What -- what do you all -- what do you all do?
L:  [SIGH] [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Eh, out here there's always something to do.
L:  Oh, you bet, there's always something to do.
R:  Yeah, twenty four hours there's --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- always --
L:  -- that's right.
R:  It's just a matter of -- of what you do.
L:  Hm.
R:  Or what kind of company you keep.
L:  That's right.
R:  Stay away --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- from the wrong company, make sure your company stays away from the wrong company and you gonna make it pretty well through the day.
L:  Oh, definitely.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, that's for sure.
R:  Have they got a lot of -- what -- they got bars and stuff down -- you all got to clubs?
L:  Um, there's the local bars, yeah.
R:  Hm.
L:  Yeah, local bars, um, not really what you'd call any clubs, you know.  They're just --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- no --
R:  Do you get drunk and plenty of stuff down there?
L:  Oh, yeah, you can do that if you want. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We have that up here a lot.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  But I said, we don't need to go to the bar up here, you see it happening right on the street.
L:  Yah, that's too bad, it --
