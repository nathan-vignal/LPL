L:  Hi!
R:  Hello!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Hi!  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Hi!  [MN]  [NOISE]  I'm Vicky.  [NOISE]  How are you?
R:  Hi, my name's Melissa.  [NOISE]
L:  Hi, Melissa.  [SIGH]  Health and fitness, do you ... work out +regularly, I guess --
R:  Um --
L:  -- huh?  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- I -- I try to do at least a hundred sit ups a day.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Um, 'cause I'm really not in s- shape, at all.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But I heard a hundred sit ups a day for, like, two, three weeks you'll be looking like Jada Pinkett.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, [LAUGH] that's what I've --
L:  Ah --  [NOISE]
R:  -- been trying to do, a couple of push ups.  I don't really go to the gym at all.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  I used to but they cost too much.
L:  Y- yes.  [LAUGH]  I agree.  [LAUGH]
R:  Hm.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Um, [LIPSMACK] oh, I mainly -- every evening I take my son for a walk around town.  We usually do, like, about maybe a mile and a half [SIGH] and --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- [SIGH] and, ah, other than that I'm too tired to do much e- [LAUGH] else.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I know the feeling --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- working all day.  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Yep.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  But a little, --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- like, [NOISE] a couple of strolls outside, you know.  If you at least walk a little bit every day --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that helps.
L:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
R:  Try to eat less but my eating habits aren't the best --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- either.
L:  No.  No, [SIGH] mine [NOISE] either.  I --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- when you have little kids it's hard to eat healthy.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  [SIGH]  It's [SIGH] "Let's grab a hot dog.  Let's have peanut butter and jelly".  [LAUGH]
R:  Pizza.  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Y- yes.  [NOISE]
R:  All types of unhealthy snacks.
L:  Oh, yes.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
L:  It's, -- I always say I'm gonna -- I'm gonna stick to, [NOISE] you know, whatever ... fitness program I've decided and, I never end up sticking to it for l- [LAUGH] long.  [LAUGH]
R:  Are we alike?
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I have another call on my line, what a perfect time.
L:  Oh, n- n- [LAUGH] no.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Um, [LIPSMACK] we'll just leave that alone.
L:  [NOISE]  [MN]
R:  Um, w- what else, u- um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- hm, [LIPSMACK] well I like --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I -- I do [NOISE] watch -- ah, usually before I used to work evenings I used to watch the Health Channel.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And they would have this thing called Bodies in Motion.  It starts at nine --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- thirty.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Every day, every half hour and me and my -- my younger sibling, my sister, we do it every day.  Try to do it whenever I'm here.
L:  O- o- oh!
R:  But it -- it's fun and it actually, you know, feels good to do it with somebody.  At least you could try with your kids.  [LAUGH]
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  Then, like, it 'cause it's a little dancing.  They'll probably like it, you know?
L:  Oh, that's cool.  [SIGH]
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, that's -- but, um, son likes [NOISE] the, ah, -- like the kick boxing exercise.  [SIGH]
R:  Yes.
L:  We -- we did that for a little bit until my son got a [NOISE] little out of control.  [NOISE]  So, ...  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-hum.  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  So, like, okay we have to find something that's a little bit more toned down [NOISE] that he can still have fun with.  [SIGH]
R:  Okay, yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  Definitely.  The kick -- kick boxing though I did want to do that a couple of years ago --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- 'cause it was the trendy thing --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- kind of?
L:  Yes.  [SIGH]
R:  And everybody was getting in shape with the Taebo and --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and that whole mess --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I [NOISE] definitely wanted to get into kick boxing.
L:  [SIGH]  It's very -- i- it -- i- it's very strenuous.  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]  Lets --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- off a lot of stress though.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  [SIGH]
R:  I know that much.
L:  [NOISE]  Yes.  [SIGH]
R:  Definitely.
L:  That's, ah, -- I told my husband he needs to get me one of those, what do they call them like a heavy bag, a punching b- [LAUGH] bag.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, those are great.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I wish I had one of 'em.  I'm so angry all the time.
L:  Y- yes.  [SIGH]
R:  I need somewhere else to take out --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- my frustration.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  Yes.  [SIGH]
R:  Definitely [NOISE] and let's see?
L:  [SIGH]
R:  What else do I do, um, [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] there's another thing too it's called, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, Windsor Pilates.
L:  Yes.
R:  Or Windsor Pilates --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- or something like that.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I did that for a week.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And the next my body a- ached like crazy after --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I did it.
L:  Oh, m- my.  [SIGH]
R:  I was hurting but it was -- [NOISE] it's a good -- it's a good ache but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I just didn't think [NOISE] it would be that much of an effect on me.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  And it's all basically stretching.  You don't really do -- [NOISE] you just -- it's weird.  It's a weird way of exercising the body.  It's [SIGH] -- it's a new thing but it works from what I understand.  Two weeks of that --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- and your guaranteed to be, like, losing ... a couple of dress sizes.
L:  Hm.
R:  That -- that's what it's for, really --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- for us females [NOISE] so we can slim down and get the way we want to be.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Oh, I'll have to check into that.  I just -- I just actually bought my son a, um, [MN] Yoga for Kids.  [SIGH]
R:  O- oh!
L:  And I thought, well maybe, you know, if I could get him to do something, you know, like that.  And I mean even if I could get his interest in something like that then [SIGH] he would be interested if I wanted to do something, you know.  So, [SIGH] [NOISE] I thought maybe we could do the Yoga [SIGH] ... for Kids --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- together to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to start.  So, [SIGH] it's, ah, [NOISE] -- it's a VCR tape.  A- ah, I don't know I ordered it off line somewhere.  So, ...  [SIGH]
R:  Okay, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [MN]  But I used to order stuff from QVC just for the hell of it --
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and that's where I got the, um, Windsor Pil- -- it was on sale for, like, twenty dollars so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] [NOISE] that's why I decided to go ahead and get it.
L:  [SIGH]  Well, they, ah, somebody -- somebody else said about that to me once before.  So, I'll have to look into that.
R:  Yeah, it's definitely -- I think it's --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- it's -- and -- it's if you -- you don't, like, have a DVD player, if you don't have time to watch it, [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it comes with a pamphlet.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  And in the pamphlet --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- it gives you, like, twelve exercises that you can do -- do yourself --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and it takes about twenty, thirty minutes to do all the exercises.
L:  Oh, that's cool.  That's cool.
R:  Yeah, that's the way I do it 'cause I don't have time to watch it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, [NOISE] that's -- my problem is m- most of my exercise tapes that I ... did like and I used to use before my son [SIGH] they're all on VCR tape.  And -- and --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- I don't have ... VCR downstairs [NOISE] any more, [NOISE] I just have the DVD player.  [SIGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  So, if I want to watch the VCR tape I have to either go to my son's room or our -- my room so [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Definitely hard to find time just to exercise any more.  [NOISE]
L:  Yes.  [SIGH]  Yes.  [SIGH]
R:  And I -- I gained a whole bunch of weight over the years and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm ready to just get --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- rid of it [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- 'cause I know it's not me.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  I'm just trying to do some little things.
L:  [MN]
R:  Yeah, and it's just you got to -- [SIGH] you got to know what you want to do and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- exercise.  I didn't think I'd be able to do a hundred situps every day.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  There's so much stuff that I'm [NOISE] involved -- work and just school --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and everything else that I try to do, balance my whole day.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [SIGH]  To actually sit down and lie down for how long to do some sit ups, --
L:  [NOISE]  Mm.
R:  -- uh-uh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Not the easiest thing in the world.  But ...
L:  Oh, I bet.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  A hundred situps a day.  I don't think I could [NOISE] do that.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  It's hard.  I tell you.  I don't do 'em all straight.  I give myself a pile, like, when -- at first I used to do twenty, [SIGH] took, like, a ten minute break, did another twenty.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And then I just --
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Well, yeah, I guess you could even split it up through out your day, too ... if you don't have time.
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  If you don't have time, you know --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- do [SIGH] do fifteen or twenty, y- you know and then a couple of hours later [NOISE] if you have another few minutes.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  That -- that's how it started off.  [LAUGH]
L:  Hm.  [LIPSMACK]  Well, that's -- that's interesting.  I might have to try that.  I used to be able to do situps, but ...  [LAUGH]
R:  Y- yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  It's been a while --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- since I've done situps.
R:  Yeah, that's how I felt.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  I couldn't even really -- I didn't even know how I started it to be h- [LAUGH] honest.
L:  Hm.  [MN]
R:  And then, d- drink l- lots of water.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  That's what I'm trying to do but it's very hard 'cause I love fruit punch.
L:  [SIGH]  Yes.
R:  And I love soda[?], so.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I just read in meals[?] if you really, like, [NOISE] want to be on a nice healthy diet you just got to start drinking lots and lots of --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- water.
L:  That's -- I -- actually I quit smoking about ... s- six months ago and [NOISE] [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and the way I did it was by drinking bottled water.  Every time I wanted a c- cigarette I'd go d- drink a --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- a whole bottle of [NOISE] water till I felt, like, I was gonna puke.  [SIGH]
R:  That's a good idea.
L:  And it was enough that it just curbed the sensation of wanting a cigarette then so ...  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  A- ah, that sounds like an idea --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I should try too myself.
L:  [SIGH]  Which -- and actually it was kind of nice because I mean I put on a little [NOISE] bit of weight but I only gain- -- I only gained, like, eight pounds after I quit smoking.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And I guess that's pretty good.  The -- you know most -- a lot of people gain ten pounds plus.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But, ah, I think it was p- probably because -- I mean even though I was, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like, eating candy and stuff I was still [NOISE] drinking lots --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- of water.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  So, ... [MN] [SIGH] o- o- oh, but yeah, I wish I could -- I wish I could m- [LAUGH] motivate myself to do something --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- every day.
R:  [SIGH]  The only way I can motivate is ju- -- like, all my clothes they just don't go together anymore.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And I'm not about to spend money ... on the styles that I really don't like.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Exactly.  [LAUGH]
R:  So, it's either slim down and get what you want and look the way you want or just look all --
L:  Blah.
R:  -- look like -- yeah, just like, you know, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- like, you have nothing -- like, you're not trying to do anything with yourself.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  And that's how I've been looking for the past year and I'm [NOISE] -- that's all it's just -- 'cause I'm a fashion freak here and there.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I'm kind of tired of seeing everybody looking better than me.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah, and it d- doesn't help [NOISE] when, you know, Tony Hill figure makes clothes that fit like a size s- seven and under.
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  Or Victoria's Secrets --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- don't even have, like, your size anywhere in the store.
L:  Exactly.
R:  You have to go to the plus size.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  [SIGH]  Yes.  [SIGH]
R:  That is not cool.  [LAUGH]
L:  No.  [SIGH]  I had to have, [NOISE] um, some surgery on my, ... [NOISE] a- ah, [NOISE] f- fallopian tubes and stuff, --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- about three years ago.  So, -- and I had, like, the fourteen [SIGH] staples across my abdomen so --
R:  Whoa!
L:  -- [SIGH] for me my problem is, you know, it's not so much [NOISE] the weight that I gained ... over the last ten years, [SIGH] [NOISE] it's [NOISE] just my stomach and [SIGH] it just makes me feel blah, so --
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- I care less about everything else.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, I have terrible stretch marks.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Y- yes.  [SIGH]
R:  They won't go away and --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I don't know what to do.  I just hope, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- you know, -- I don't know if losing weight makes a lot this stuff [NOISE] go away or makes it look worse.
L:  Uh-hum.  [MN]
R:  I don't know.
L:  [SIGH]  Well, ... my girlfriend lost eighty [NOISE] seven pounds after ... [NOISE] she had her daughter [NOISE] and she was determined that [SIGH] instead of just losing the baby fat she was losing it all.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  And she lost eighty seven pounds and I mean she still has some stretch marks.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's not even so much stretch marks as it is, like, loose skin, like, on her stomach.
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  But for the most part you can't tell.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean she wears, like, a size five now so [SIGH] --
R:  Oh!  [SIGH]
L:  -- I'm like, "It --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- must be nice".  [SIGH]
R:  Y- yeah, it really must be.  I --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- wish I looked like that, gosh.
L:  [LAUGH]  So, [SIGH] yes, --
R:  [MN]  I went out --
L:  -- but then again she was only, like, nineteen when she had her daughter, so she was still really y- [LAUGH] young.  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, but, hm, [SIGH] how did she lose eighty seven p- pounds?
L:  [SIGH]  U- um, ... just lots of t- trying different things till she found something that worked for her.  And [SIGH] she kind of took, like, a combination of, um, [LIPSMACK] like the Atkins Diet where she cut out a lot of the carbohydrates [SIGH] and --
