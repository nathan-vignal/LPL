R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hey, how are you?
L:  Doing good.
R:  Hi, Vincent here and you?
L:  Robert.
R:  Robert.  So, um, do you work out? [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I -- I -- I think I work out. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, and what do you do?
L:  No, I actually just reset up my equipment from my move and about to get back into it. [NOISE] I just injured my leg so I haven't done it in a while.
R:  Ah, I see.
L:  But, I have a, um -- kind of like a exercise bike thing.  It's not really a bike --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's what we call a time work -- time work.
R:  Uh-huh, I see.
L:  And -- and a couple -- and an ab roller --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and that's about it.
R:  So, you don't have a gym membership or anything?
L:  We did and it just ended and I told my fiancee we shouldn't do it and we did a year ago and I think we went twice. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] For the whole year?
L:  For the whole year.
R:  [LAUGH] How much did you pay?
L:  I don't think she went at all.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's thirty five bucks a month for a year or seventy bucks a month.
R:  Oh, my god.
L:  Yeah, so I'm done with the gym, I'm --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- going to do my own equipment at home.
R:  Uh-huh, I see.  Well, um, [LIPSMACK] well -- I, you know, I go to school so I -- I pretty much pay f- -- you know, it's a part of my tuition so, um -- so I already paid for my gym, but, uh, I don't really use my -- the gym at school so -- anyway --
L:  And where do you go to school?
R:  I go to NYU here in New York.
L:  I've been getting a lot of calls from New York, talking to a lot of New York folks --
R:  Oh really?
L:  -- it must have -- the word must have spread in New York 'cause --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I think the last three people --
R:  [LAUGH] Where are you?
L:  -- were from New York.  I'm actually in Boulder, Colorado.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Uh, I grew up in --
R:  So, you -- uh-huh.
L:  -- grew up in Jersey --
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  -- so I know where you are.
R:  Which part of Jersey?
L:  In Piscataway, New Brunswick there.
R:  Oh, uh, actually --
L:  Went to Rutgers.
R:  -- my brother went to the Rut- -- uh, yeah, went to Rutgers University --
L:  Yep, so did I.  I grew up the same town, went to school there --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and out here in Colorado.
R:  Wow, wow.
L:  So ...
R:  Well, that's great.
L:  So, you don't be using the gym even though it's there and it's free?
R:  Yeah, I know, yeah.  Well -- well I usually just work out at home so -- it's easier. [LAUGH] Yeah, just do push ups and, um -- yeah --
L:  Are you a film student?
R:  Yeah I'm a stu- student but I'm doing my PhD so -- yeah.
L:  What kind of student?
R:  I'm doing my PhD, so ...
L:  Is it -- in -- I said, "Are you a film student?"
R:  No, no, I'm not a film student --
L:  Okay, the --
R:  -- I'm doing, uh, education, so ...
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  So, you -- so you -- you -- [LAUGH] how many phone calls have you already made?
L:  [NOISE] I think this is either my third or fourth, I ca- --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- uh, somewhere around there.
R:  Huh.
L:  I've been getting a lot of calls, I just ain't been available --
R:  I see.
L:  -- and I only talk when, uh, my old lady's not here and so nobody's home, so I --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- can do that. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, I -- I don't know how that wor- -- I thought you can only make three phone calls or something but anyway, I might be wrong?
L:  Yeah, this must be my third then.
R:  Uh, I see.
L:  And, uh, like, I really don't know the details of, uh --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, I don't know all the details but I think it is three and this must be my third.
R:  Uh-huh.  So, uh, well I guess you're done with the whole gym thing, so what's next -- I guess you can just [NOISE] -- I mean, do it at home or somewhere? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, no, I've got the equipment on my porch --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- um, I ready to get started, I'm just letting my --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- leg heal --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I'm getting married in two months, so I'd like to lose weight so at least I have something to drive me.
R:  You're getting married?
L:  Yeah.
R:  In two months?  Well, conju- -- congratulations. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  So, uh, I'm -- I'm trying to be fit for that, I'm -- I'm on a diet, I've lost all kinds of weight just stop- -- just changing my eating and not even --
R:  What kind of diet --
L:  -- working out.
R:  -- are you on?
L:  I'm just low on the carbs and the fat --
R:  Okay, so that do- --
L:  -- all the women at work are pissed off 'cause I lost, like, fourteen pounds in two weeks --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- they're all hating life.
R:  So, you just -- no carbs just protein and meat and --
L:  Basically stopped going the fast food is really my main thing, I real- --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I stopped that and low carbs and it's just falling off, so ...
R:  [LIPSMACK] How do you call it -- Aktin, uh, A- --
L:  That is -- it's similar to that but I'm not that strict --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and that's what pissed them off because they're all strict and I'm --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just dropping weight by the pound every week and they're just fired up with me -- [LAUGH]
R:  I think it must be, you know --
L:  -- 'cause women can't do that as easy.
R:  -- uh, it has to do with your metabolism or something, so I guess you just -- it's easier for you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to lose weight, I guess.
L:  So, I'm going to be working out here --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I'm in a softball league first time ever, so, uh --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- that could be helping losing weight too.
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  So, um, I -- I don't know, I've never been to Colorado so it's hard for me to imagine what kind of, you know [SIGH] -- uh, the feel of  the city or -- or where you live.  It's -- it's pretty much -- it's, uh, metropolitan or it's -- you know --
L:  I am right outside of Denver --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- so, yeah, we're con- -- we're, uh, considered the metro area but I'm about thirty miles outside of Denver.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Boulder, Colorado's got, uh, a few issues here --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so, uh --
R:  There was a big fire, like, last year or two years ago?
L:  Yeah, a big fire last year.
R:  Last --
L:  We were going through a bad drought, we -- we're doing better.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It, uh --
R:  Why did the -- yeah, there's a big fire now in Arizona, I think.
L:  Have you -- you've never heard of Boulder, Colorado?  Be a first --
R:  Well, I -- well, I --
L:  -- if you haven't.
R:  -- m- -- mm -- well how -- heard of -- I have heard of it but I've never been there.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, and when I heard -- the thing is --
L:  Our two cl- -- two claim to fames or three, is the great American beer festival --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the Mork and Mindy house --
R:  I see.
L:  -- and the Jon Benet Ramsey [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, right --
L:  -- peop- people come to town --
R:  -- that's right -- that's right.
L:  -- and actually go on tours and go look at her house, it's sickening.
R:  -- yes.  And do they still live there or ...?
L:  Oh, no, they, you know -- have -- they had to get out of town. [NOISE] This town --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- got really weirded out around all that shit.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, now they're in Atlanta or something like that.
R:  Ah, I see.
L:  So, that's where everybody knows Boulder from.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Unfortunately.
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly, you just reminded me. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So, uh --
R:  The Benet -- Jon Benet Ramsey people. [NOISE]
L:  Yep, that's us.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So ...
R:  So, uh, did you -- what do you think about the case?  What's the -- the --
L:  I don't know.
R:  -- the feel of the town?
L:  Things are much better and calmed down so it's not -- not much of an issue now that it was -- it's, like, six years now.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And, uh, so I don't know, I'm having a hard time with it that's for sure, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I really don't know what to think.
R:  [LAUGH] But, when --
L:  So ...
R:  -- when it first happened, I guess --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- everybody pretty much think that either the mother or the father, I guess?
L:  Yeah, well the trippiness about it was the fact that it was Christmas Eve and that's what freaked everybody out.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause you know in most houses, Christmas Eve, you don't be sneaking in people's houses on Christmas Eve.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know what I mean, the whole thing about it was weird from the start --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, that's why I have a feeling that all the truth is not out but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's that.
R:  [NOISE] Mm.
L:  NYC is, I want to say, not Harlem, East Harlem?  Where is NYC?
R:  Wh- where?
L:  Yeah, what part of New York?
R:  Oh, uh, I live -- uh, it actually has -- it's called Hamilton Heights, but it's -- it's basically by the r- -- Hudson River and it's --
L:  That's what I thought.
R:  -- it's north of Harlem and, uh, south of --
L:  That's what I thought.
R:  -- Washington Heights, I don't know if you know the neighborhood, but it's pretty much upper, upper West Side, so ...
L:  Yeah.  No, been there.
R:  You've been there?
L:  Yeah, no, like -- like, I said, I grew up in Jersey.
R:  Oh, yeah, right, right.
L:  So ...
R:  It's, uh, actually right across -- uh, right across the, um -- the Washington -- George --
L:  Bridge.
R:  -- Washington Bridge, yeah.
L:  Yeah, will --
R:  Yeah, so actually I just moved here so -- I like the neighborhood, but, uh, [LIPSMACK] you know, it's nice.
L:  Have you got one of those Friends houses?
R:  What's that?
L:  Have you got one of those apartments in Friends for, like, fifteen hundred dollars a month? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, um -- well actually I got quite a good deal, but, uh, yeah, it's, um -- it's getting expensive, but, uh, I got a good deal, so -- which is good --
L:  Good.
R:  -- yeah, but, uh, well --
L:  So, when you work out --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- by the way, do you think this test is about how long we can stay on the subject or just dialogue?
R:  Um, I don't know, it's interesting, uh, this is my first phone call so --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- it might I think, you know, that's part of the purp- -- you know, the -- the study said they don't want us to know, you know, what this is, otherwise you'll be biased, so -- so I guess they'll just keep -- keep us guessing, I guess. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, you know what, I thought it was dialogue and someone else said --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- "No, they're -- they're timing us to see how long we can stay on the subject". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I guess we failed again on this -- this call I never stay on the subject --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- 'cause it's ten minutes and -- oh, by the way, at ten minutes the phone will just die, I will let you know that.
R:  Really?
L:  [LIPSMACK] The prompt's going to come on and say, "You've got ten seconds to say -- to end your call". 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and then after that it's just going to go, "Boop" and you're gone. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  But I will get my money? [LAUGH] That's im- --
L:  The other guys -- yeah -- I'm -- I'm --
R:  -- that's the most important thing --
L:  -- feeling confident about that because I've talked to people that have gotten it so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I'm feeling confident that's it's not a major scam, uh --
R:  Well --
L:  -- or nothing.
R:  -- well, if it -- it is, well, I, [LIPSMACK] um -- I'm glad I'm part of it. [LAUGH] No, no, I'm just kidding.  But, um, if it -- well, it seems like it's -- it's a legitimate study so, I don't know.
L:  No, it does, plus we gave them our social security number so we're already passed the point of no return.
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  If it's not legit they already got our bank account and all our money's probably --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- already gone, so it doesn't matter.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, um, oh I hope -- I hope not, [LAUGH] but, um --
L:  No, I've talked to some other people and it's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- supposed to -- everything seems to be cool.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So ...
R:  That's good, that's good.
L:  So, I'm not too worried. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, when you do work out what do you do?
R:  Well, I just do, you know, sit ups and, um -- at home and do some dumb, uh -- weight training by --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- myself and dumb bells, that kind of stuff --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so nothing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- major.  But, uh, yeah --
