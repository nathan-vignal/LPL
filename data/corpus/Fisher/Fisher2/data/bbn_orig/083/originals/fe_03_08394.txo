L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi!
L:  Hi, this is Jennifer from --
R:  Jennifer?
L:  -- Oklahoma.
R:  Hi, this is Tracy from Michigan.
L:  Well, hi, Tracy.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  How are you?
L:  I'm fine.
R:  Good!
L:  I -- I love the topic.  [LAUGH]
R:  You do!
L:  No!  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh!  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  I -- I'm not -- I used to exercise a lot before I had children.  [SIGH]
L:  That's what I was going to say.  My exercise is my children.
R:  Exactly.  [NOISE]  Y- you have two children?
L:  Yes.  [SIGH]
R:  Me -- me too.  [SIGH]  And, I'm constantly ... r- running back and forth between the two of 'em.  I have an eighteen month old and a four year old.  And ... between the two them I definitely get enough exercise between outside and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- inside and everything else.
L:  Y- yep.  [SIGH]  I --
R:  But, um, --
L:  [LIPSMACK]  I've got a ten month old and, ah, um, two and a half year old.  So, [SIGH] --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- by the time they're both asleep, if they're both ever asleep, you just -- you don't have the energy any more to go out and exercise.  [SIGH]
R:  I know!  [NOISE]  I know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean [SIGH] every once in a while I'll put them in the stroller, and take 'em for a walk [NOISE] around the ... the circle here but I just -- I don't have the e- [LAUGH] energy.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  No.
R:  And I totally understand that.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  But ... I --
L:  They -- they do keep you fit.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, as much as, yeah, [SIGH] I mean I do for -- I'm a stay [NOISE] at home mom, [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  Okay, yeah, and I -- I just ... have found that, um, you know I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I would like to exercise more but I feel that when I worked [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I had more time -- it felt like I had more time when I worked than I do now that I'm ... at home.
L:  [SIGH]  Yep.
R:  Because, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a- ah, it's not only ... the kids it's e- everything else and I just [NOISE] -- I don't have time for myself [NOISE] anymore and it's, like, [NOISE] you know, when do you fit in exercise?
L:  When you actually do get that time for yourself you're vegging out and [NOISE] --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- doing something for your.  [NOISE]
R:  I'm on the computer mainly.
L:  Me too.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  I -- I work f- for -- out of my home I do, um, merchandising and stuff [NOISE] --
R:  Oh, okay, yeah.  [SIGH]  Yeah.
L:  So, I -- if I'm not glued to my computer out doing that, I mean, --
R:  [NOISE] Ex --
L:  -- [NOISE] every last minute is chasing my kids.
R:  -- exactly, I know.  I've just started doing mystery shopping and things so ...
L:  Oh, you do?  [SIGH]
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh!  [SIGH]
R:  So, it's like, you know, oh, I guess that's a little bit of exercise getting out and doing that sort of thing but, you know.
L:  Oh, yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  I mean I -- I [NOISE] [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- yeah, there's not a whole lot of time.
L:  I notice a lot of people that are doing the Fisher thing are from [NOISE] ... the -- the m- mystery shopping groups.
R:  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]  Yeah, I -- I --
L:  I think it's --
R:  -- do you do mystery shopping?
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  Okay.  [SIGH]
L:  That's how I got into the merchandizing.  I -- I do some mystery shopping still but I try to ... s- stick with the merchandising [NOISE] 'cause it pays better.  [SIGH]
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Yeah, it's, um, -- I -- I've just started.  So, about a month and a half ago [SIGH] but --
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's nice.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  [SIGH]  And I -- I actually found out about this survey from, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- yeah, one of the l- lists that I'm on.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, ...
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  I think it's on -- u- under cover shoppers and a lot of miscellaneous right now.
R:  [SIGH]  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  Yeah.
L:  So, ...
R:  I think that's -- uh-hum, yep --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it's exactly where I've seen it.
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Definitely.  [SIGH]  That's funny.  [SIGH]
L:  It's a small world.  [SIGH]
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  It is, [SIGH] u- um, --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- but, yeah, I mean when -- 'cause I'm -- [SIGH] h- how old are you?
L:  I'm twenty four.
R:  Twenty four.  Oh, my gosh, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm thirty two and --
L:  That's not old.  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
R:  -- well, that's a lot older than ... twenty four.  [SIGH]
L:  Huh!
R:  But I found also that it was easier to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- maintain a little bit of s- stamina when I was younger because older you get ... the harder --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it is.
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  I mean, I -- I feel so tired all the time.  Twenty four I was, like, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I could, -- y- you know, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- set the world on fire.  [SIGH]  But anymore I'm just like [SIGH] -- [LIPSMACK] o- o- oh!  I'm --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- so tired at night.
L:  If it ever gets out of the mid nineties maybe I will.  [SIGH]
R:  Well, yeah, you guys have some --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- some really h- hot weather down there.  Huh?
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, we're about to get thunder storms so it'll be nice and muggy tomorrow.
R:  Oh, great.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, I think we're headed for some thunderstorms here too.  That's --
L:  O- o- oh!
R:  -- I just looked at the weather channel and that's what they said too.  [SIGH]  So, ...
L:  O- o- oh!  [SIGH]
R:  [MN]  But, [SIGH] yeah, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I -- I try to, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- get out swimming with my kids and stuff but there's only so much you can actually do with that too.  [NOISE]  So, ...
L:  Yeah, trying to keep 'em from drowning each other, that type of thing.  [SIGH]
R:  Exactly.  [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  So, ...
L:  My daughter's discovered how to crawl under my son's crib --
R:  Oh, no!
L:  -- and terrorize him.  [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, ...  [LAUGH]
R:  Do they pick on each other?  [SIGH]  Mine pick on each other.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  They just -- y- yeah.  [SIGH]  It's like my eighteen month old just walks up to ... her sister and just t- takes whatever's in her hand or whatever --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I mean she's just --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- she terrorizes ... the older one.  I f- feel so bad.  [SIGH]  But --
L:  Yeah, I keep telling my daughter her -- her day'll come.  She needs to be nicer to h- [LAUGH] her b- [LAUGH] brother.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  He's bigger than her.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, yeah, it's only going to get worse as she gets more mobile.
R:  Oh, yes.  [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, definitely.  [SIGH]
L:  But --
R:  I know it does.  It's like --
L:  Is this your first -- your first Fisher call?  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Yes.  [SIGH]
L:  I -- I -- this is my third so ...
R:  Is it?
L:  Yeah, I'm hoping I get more but I'm not counting on it.
R:  I know.  Well, they have -- some people said they were -- they've been, [NOISE] like, doing [NOISE] four and five, but --
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] I don't know how, um, -- how they're doing that.  So, ...
L:  [SIGH]  I -- it's supposed to be the three but I think they just randomly let you have more.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, ...
R:  Okay.
L:  I know they pay if you do the calls though.
R:  Okay.
L:  That's something they've -- they've made clear.  [SIGH]
R:  Ah, right.  Right.
L:  So, ...
R:  I have seen that on the list.
L:  That's comforting.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly and, you know, I can talk to someone for a few minutes about something for ... money.  So, ...
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's interesting, you know?
R:  It is, yeah.  [SIGH]  So, ... but --
L:  I had a ... [NOISE] New Yorker I think on my first one.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, really?  Okay.
L:  From -- [NOISE] he's some sort of entrepreneur or something and he [NOISE] [SIGH] -- he was interesting to t- [LAUGH] talk to [LAUGH] too.
R:  Really?
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  I just -- I, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I -- I don't get out much or do anything so it's like if I can talk to any ... o- other adults, you know, on the phone I'm --
L:  I know.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I'm so happy over that [SIGH] because I -- I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't get a chance to get out much and --
L:  You find yourself rhyming everything.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Oh, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  So, ...
R:  Some, yeah, [SIGH] I don't know.  [SIGH]  But, I was looking over the l- list of topics --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- here and health and fitness [NOISE] was just not one of the ones [NOISE] that I really wanted to get but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that's okay.
L:  [SIGH]  I -- but it's a fun topic really 'cause you know most people are going to be, like, "Well, no not really".  [SIGH]
R:  I know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  And here they say that [SIGH] the country --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is the most overweight it's ever been and I -- I mean you -- everytime you look at CNN or whatever, it shows these [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, super heavy over weight people that they've got their cameras on and everything and it's, like, "Oh, my gosh", you know.
L:  I'm glad that's not m- m- me!
R:  I know!
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  I know.  [SIGH]  But I just think --
L:  It's all the McDonald's.  I think we should sue.  [NOISE]
R:  O- oh, a- ah, yes, that's the craziest thing.
L:  I think s- so.
R:  It's like you --
L:  [SIGH]  It's worse --
R:  -- know.
L:  -- than the coffee thing.
R:  Oh, yeah!  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  I mean the coffee thing at least you can go, "Hey, moron!"
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  [LAUGH]
L:  And then go, "Well, she got something, okay" but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [SIGH] but you know if you're going to eat greasy fatty food no matter where it comes from you're gonna get big.
R:  Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  That's -- I know, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I say the same thing every time -- every time I hear about someone suing t- this restaurant or that restaurant or whatever it's, like, [LIPSMACK] "Hello?"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean you know what it's gonna cause.  [NOISE]  It's gonna cause obesity.  [LAUGH]  You eat it twenty times a day, of course, you're --
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  -- gonna get fat.  [SIGH]  And --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- ah, yeah, I don't -- I don't get it.
L:  Now, the restaurant that gives you the burger with Mad Cow disease, that would be the restaurant I would sue.
R:  Exactly.
L:  But -- but just saying, "I didn't know that eating twenty five Big Macs a day was going to make me fat --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- and get heart disease".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  I know and people are getting --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- away with it.  It's just --
L:  I know.  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] the things that people sue over, it's just nuts anymore.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  But, yeah, [SIGH] I know I --  [NOISE]
L:  They need to exercise.  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, and then all the [NOISE] over -- over weight children too.  I mean you see all these things, you know, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- these studies on all these kids who are just so obese --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- anymore, [NOISE] it's like, "Well, ... what are you feeding them at home?"
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  You know --
L:  [NOISE]  [LIPSMACK]  Oh, my little guy --
R:  And --
L:  -- I'm hoping he turns out.  [LAUGH]
R:  I know, my -- my second one she was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a- ah, she --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- she's starting to thin out --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean the m- more a- active --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- she is and everything --
L:  I think once he walks instead of, [NOISE] -- you know, crawling and pulling himself uphill, he'll --
R:  Right.
L:  -- kind of grow up instead of out.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  [SIGH]  Mine, ah, she had, -- a- ah, I think she had, like, five rolls on her legs.  I mean she was --
L:  Oh, my!  [LAUGH]
R:  -- she was really, really chunky but she's thinned out a lot since --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- she's started walking and everything.  So, [SIGH] yes, I'm thankful for that 'cause my older one is, like, a beanpole.  I mean, she's --
L:  That's how my daughter is she -- she's Miss Skinny and he weighs [NOISE] about as much as she does.
R:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]  I know.
L:  So, ... yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  That -- that's almost what this is, ah, Jessica is --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- she'll -- well, she's gonna be four in a week [SIGH] a- and she is, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like, oh, my gosh, she is so tall.  [NOISE]  She looks like a ... five or six year old.  [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  A- and, she's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- she's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think thirty two pounds.  I mean, she's just this little --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- teeny tiny thing that's, like, four feet tall, you know?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And it's, like, "Oh, my gosh!"  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, I keep telling my daughter, "You need to eat".
R:  I know.  I know.
L:  "Please.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  Something other than crayons and candy".
R:  I k- [LAUGH] know.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yep, she's -- she keeps telling me, "My favorite food is junk food".  And I say, "Well, you know you need to eat other things, honey".
L:  Good for you.  Let's throw out all the junk foods.
R:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Well, she goes to grandma's --
L:  O- o- oh!
R:  -- that's where she gets the junk food, you know.  Of course, grandma's just load 'em up on that sort of thing.  So, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]  Hm.
R:  -- I know.  [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You can only say so much but --
L:  Yeah, bubba -- bubba got his first, ah, sucker the other day.
R:  O- o- oh, that's fun.
L:  He was in heaven.
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  Oh, yeah, that's fun.  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
L:  It's now the -- the, like, five to ten minute distraction if I'm really busy and, ah, I don't want to let him down.
R:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Well, does it bother you when you go ... to the bank or to the restaur- -- or not to the restaurant, like, the grocery store and they just automatically hand --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- your kids --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- candy?
L:  Most of 'em are -- are pretty good about asking but I think that's 'cause they have kids and they've been bothered by it.
R:  [SIGH]  Right.  [NOISE]  See, I find --
L:  [NOISE]  But it -- it ... [NOISE] does bother me especially if it's, like, gum and I -- she's not allowed to have that.
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  You know, she's two, don't give her gum.
R:  Right.  I know, and it really bothers me because [SIGH] I went to the bank the other day and ... went through the drive through and they --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- loaded up the thing full of suckers and I was like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- "Oh, my gosh!"  [SIGH]  First of all --
L:  They probably thought they were being sweet.
R:  I know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but first of all he didn't ask and second of all it's like, one a piece is totally [SIGH] fine --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- "You didn't have to give 'em, like, five a piece" you know.
L:  You put a ton in there and they're going to see it, come on!
R:  Exactly.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  We've got to be able to hide it in a purse.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  It was pretty funny.  I just, like, got 'em out and, like, dumped them on the seat so that the kids couldn't see 'em.  I was, like, "Oh, my gosh!"  [SIGH]
L:  My daughter now when we go to the bank she's like, "Sucker!  Sucker!"
R:  [LAUGH]
