L:  [NOISE] Hello, this is Stephanie.
R:  [SIGH] Hi, I'm [NOISE] Jenny.
L:  [LIPSMACK] And do you exercise regularly?
R:  [SIGH] Uh, [LAUGH] [NOISE] um, I used to. [NOISE] I, um, was, oh, let me see, my daughter's sixteen, [NOISE] so I guess it was about seven years ago [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I weighed probably about three hundred and fifty, so it took me --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- two years and I went down [SIGH] to about a hundred and fifty and then I quit exercises, so now I'm back again. [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] But, uh, no, not ever day now, but I sued to.  What about you? [SIGH] 
L:  I'm lucky to exercise once a month.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] I have a son that I -- that [MN] keeps me running.
R:  How old is he? [SIGH] 
L:  One.
R:  Oh, okay, yeah --
L:  He'll be two in September --
R:  -- you have little ones.
L:  -- so 
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, my niece is three [SIGH] and my daughter's sixteen and she just started a exercise program at the Y.M.C.A. so  [SIGH] 
L:  Well, I exercise at least, uh, you know, once a month --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- it -- which isn't much, but [LIPSMACK] I figure it's a l- [MN] some's better than none.
R:  [SIGH] That's true.  W- where are you from?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Kentucky.
R:  Oh, okay, yeah, I'm in Virginia, so we're both, [SIGH] uh, from southern -- more southern. [SIGH] But, um, [SIGH] no, I used to -- well, what do you do?  It said to ask what you do.  When I did it I [MN] did aerobics and then I joined a gym, but I was so heavy when I started that I just did it at home --
L:  [SIGH] Well --
R:  -- and, uh --
L:  -- um, I've never been heavy other than being pregnant --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I've never had a problem with -- I'm one of those people that people love to hate because I can eat what I want and still stay slim.
R:  Uh, right. [SIGH] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] And so I've never worried about it, but when I do do it, I do, like, the Richard Simmons, which is the easiest for me.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] And yoga I do [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- well, I do yoga mostly these days.
R:  [SIGH] I like yoga. [SIGH] I do yoga.  Before it was cool, I did yoga, when I was a teenager, I did it [SIGH] when nobody else did it.  Now it's, like, the in thing and I'm like, "This is old hat [LAUGH] to me".
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
R:  But, um, [SIGH] I don't know, I guess as far as, um -- so, do you bike ride or anything?  Because you can do other stuff besides just exercise I guess.
L:  Well, see, that's what I do, I go walking with the kids and [SIGH] go and, um, bicycle with the kids and stuff like that.  I'm on the run constantly with them [LIPSMACK] and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- so I figure that's enough exercise --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- because I'm running after them all day.
R:  Right. [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] 'Cause I've got a six year old daughter, too.
R:  Yeah, I babysat my niece and she's f- well, she's be four in November and [SIGH] that's a workout. [LAUGH] You'd have to meet [NOISE] her. [SIGH] That's a workout in itself [SIGH] and she's very -- I mean, she -- I -- we need to put in gymnastics or something because she's very, very, um -- [SIGH] I don't want to say hyperactive, she's just go a lot of energy and she's --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, see my daughter --
R:  -- real limber.
L:  -- is -- my daughter is pretty laid back, [LIPSMACK] and therefore I can't get her off the couch.  I took --
R:  [SIGH] Now, is she --
L:  -- her to gymnastics [MN] a couple --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of times and she wouldn't get off the bleachers. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, really?  Maybe she was scared.
L:  Well, she's shy too --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- but she's still -- you couldn't get her off the bleachers.
R:  Now, is she slim like you?  She -- after that. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah, she's like a rack of bones.
R:  So, she probably feels like [SIGH] she don't need to exercise.  I know in school, [SIGH] I don't know if they did it when you were in school, we had P.E. and stuff, but [SIGH] the school my daughter goes to they don't do any of that, [SIGH] so, [SIGH] I think for health reasons if you're extremely heavy [SIGH] you should do something every day --
L:  Yeah, I'll tell you -- 
R:  -- even if it's walking.
L:  -- my -- m- my sister, she is ten years old and she is the most active child I've ever seen and she is ex- she is still -- like, I'm twenty six and she's ten and wearing the same size. [NOISE] 
R:  Really? [SIGH] Well, you --
L:  And a lot of the times her clothes are bigger than mine, and -- [LIPSMACK] but she's on the healthy side and  --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- she is the most active child I've seen.
R:  That's where --
L:  She stays on the run constantly, you can't slow her down.
R:  [NOISE] [MN] 
L:  They [MN] went and told her that she had that hyperactive --
R:  [NOISE] That A.D.D. stuff? [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, that's what my daughter's got. [SIGH] 
L:  But --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [MN] I don't think it really matters --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- on how much you exercise because she is --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- she is, [MN] like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- just a bigger muscle.
R:  Right.  Well, you said that you did it about once a month but you still stayed slim.  I think [NOISE] some people [SIGH] are just naturally thin. [NOISE] [SIGH] And, uh -- but [NOISE] my family's thin. [NOISE] I didn't get heavy [NOISE] until I got pregnant the same as you, only I didn't get [NOISE] thin back afterwards. [LAUGH] I just kinda --
L:  Well, see, that's how --
R:  -- got lazy and --
L:  -- my sister is.
R:  -- laid around. [NOISE] 
L:  My sister, when she got -- first got pregnant --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- she was, like, a fourteen --
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] 
L:  -- and -- which for how she's made, she was pretty small because how she was made.
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] Right.
L:  She was just proportioned --
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] 
L:  -- right. [SIGH] And she didn't exercise --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- or anything while she was pregnant and she went up to, like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [NOISE] a size eighteen --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- or twenty after she had the baby.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  And --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- like I said, I don't exercise much at all --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and -- but I'm on --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the run constantly.
R:  Right.
L:  I don't -- I can't find the time to exercise. [LAUGH] When I do, I do a thirty minute aerobic thing with, uh --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- Richard Simmons.
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] I like him, I -- he's real easy, and then when I do weights -- when I do -- w- usually when I do it, I do, like, the firm --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] and then alternate that with [NOISE] Richard Simmons.  Now a lot --
L:  Well, I've got the --
R:  -- of people tell me he's too easy --
L:  -- I --
R:  -- but I like him. [SIGH] 
L:  I've got the strengthening one and y- I use the five pound weights instead of the -- [SIGH] that, uh, cord thing he's got.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] And I think that is good.
R:  [SIGH] Now do you have his new tapes, or -- 'cause I have so much of the oldies [NOISE] which are so old it's not funny.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, I've --
R:  [SIGH] But I don't have any of his --
L:  -- I've got --
R:  -- newer ones. [NOISE] 
L:  -- that one too, but I've --
R:  [NOISE] You do have that one? [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  I've got 'em all recorded on one tape now so it's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- easier to just go through --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- 'em and not do the same one --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- over. [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] Yeah, it's easier that way, I think. [NOISE] 
L:  I get bored real quick --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- at the same exercise.
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] See, my daughter's like that.  She --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] at the Y, they make her do [NOISE] the treadmill [SIGH] for thirty --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- to forty minutes on her -- when she does her aerobics and then [NOISE] for her weight training, but she says that she -- "Mom, I want to swim or I want to do --"
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  "-- something other than --" [NOISE] because I think when you do the same exact thing over and over [NOISE] again [SIGH] it gets --
L:  It gets very monotonous.
R:  Y- yeah, and she wants to do [SIGH] more [inaudible], but they said because she's so -- she's never been active [NOISE] at all [MN] and being on Ritalin didn't help [NOISE] because it kept her really passive.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] So, um, when [NOISE] [MN] she went off of that, she's trying to get more active, but her heart is not that great, [NOISE] [SIGH] so I think they don't want to work her to hard, you know, make her [SIGH] run or something and have a heart attack. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] So, they're starting her off slow. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah, see --
R:  But --
L:  -- I'm not -- like --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- one of, like, three people that's in my close family that's actually skinny.  [LIPSMACK] the rest of 'em --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- are obese --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- are they -- uh, I've even got --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- uh, one or two --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- aunts that's, like, on, like, disability because they're so obese.
R:  Oh, my goodness. [SIGH] Now, I've got my best friend's sister [NOISE] is trying to get [NOISE] [SIGH] assessed, uh, well, in fact, she was in a car accident and hurt her back [NOISE] --
L:  [SIGH] Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] and she was doing [MN] exercise and physical therapy [NOISE] [SIGH] but they dropped her case because she's, like, close to --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I mean, she's, uh, obese, at least close to four hundred. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they said that there -- they just don't think it was caused by the accident and so [NOISE] she got a failed chart because, I mean, she is heavy. [NOISE] [SIGH] They said, "I don't think the back injury is [NOISE] so much from the accident as it is, you're just a very heavy [SIGH] person". [LAUGH] [NOISE] So, um --
L:  Well, see, I had a friend --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- like that, they went and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- uh, they said it -- --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- she wouldn't even have got --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- hurt if she hadn't been obese.
R:  [SIGH] Right, [SIGH] so she --
L:  [LIPSMACK] And --
R:  -- tries to walk and, I mean, I walk with her, of course I have to go slow, [SIGH] and she -- because she's only twenty four, so she's -- she's young 'cause we're all -- [SIGH] well, you said you were twenty six, [NOISE] we're, like, thirty two, [SIGH] so I'm a little bit older than you, but she's only twenty four, so to be that heavy, [SIGH] you know, that's kind of [SIGH] I think dangerous. 
L:  My fiance's, like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- thirty six years old and the man --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- don't get out --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and he's so thin. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, really?
L:  He sits on his rump all day, [SIGH] um, pushing buttons and --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- for work, with his feet up --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- propped up in the air --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [MN] and he still stays, uh, thin as he can be.  He's, like, a size thirty, thirty two.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Very thin, and tall --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- so [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] -- and he doesn't do anything --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and if I didn't at least watch what I eat a l- --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- some of the time, I would probably be heavier than what I am.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  But I'm in a size eight now --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- which isn't big anyway --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- but I do try --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- to watch what I eat.
R:  Yeah, I was a -- a size three when I got married, and everybody told me I looked horrible, [SIGH] and then --
L:  Well, see that's me, b-
R:  -- I got a -- [LIPSMACK] like, to about a twenty two. That's my biggest so, [SIGH] I've been --
L:  Well, when I was pr --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- after --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [MN] before I had --
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] 
L:  -- my daugt- or got --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- pregnant with my daughter I was --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- a three was falling off from me.
R:  Right. [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] And, of course, gained forty pounds with her --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and -- which -- I walked all through my pregnancy with her [SIGH] and I still gained forty pounds and mo- [MN] and thirty of it --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- was [MN] in the last --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- three months.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [SIGH] And --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I went and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I've still not lost --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the last twenty of the forty pounds and I've had a son since.  I didn't gain any with him, though.
R:  [NOISE] Well, that's good. [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] But see, I learnt from the first time --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you're -- actually, you just need to eat --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- one -- for one --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- instead of ten. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right, that's true.  So, you have a six old and then a little one.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] A one year old.
L:  Yeah, he'll be two in --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- September.
R:  Okay.
L:  [SIGH] And so, that's my exercise.
R:  [SIGH] I can --
L:  I don't have time to go to the gym.
R:  Yeah, I -- well, I don't go to the gym, [NOISE] [LAUGH] see, I pay for her to go to the gym, I should go to the gym, [SIGH] but, um, [NOISE] I mean, I don't see anything wrong with -- [NOISE] there are people -- and there are the people -- I also have --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- a friend [NOISE] who obsesses if she doesn't do five or six hours a day, which is ridiculous.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [SIGH] But [NOISE] she used to be real, real heavy and she -- [NOISE] this is the only way.  And plus she smokes cigarettes. [NOISE] I don't know if you smoke, but I had quit with both my kids.
L:  I live in -- on --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- smo- uh, smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] Which is --
R:  [SIGH] 'Cause I s- I smoke.  I'm trying to quit but I said that's my only vice, I don't drink --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- or do drugs [NOISE] [LAUGH] so give me my cigarettes, [SIGH] but when I was exercising regularly [NOISE] I didn't want to smoke.  It was, like, I would come home and I actually didn't want to, so 
L:  I don't see how anybody --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- can do drugs --
R:  I think it helps in that respect.
L:  -- I'm -- I'm lucky to -- I'm lucky to afford my cigarettes and my coffee. [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  Some drugs just c-
