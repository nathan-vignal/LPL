R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, this is, uh, Bill from New York.
L:  Wow, Sophia from New York.
R:  Uh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Where do you -- what part of New York?
L:  Woodside, Queens.
R:  Uh, okay.
L:  You?
R:  I'm from, uh, Lynbrook.
L:  Oh, wow, way up there. [LAUGH] Okay.
R:  Yeah, it's not that far.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, the topic is, uh, fitness --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and health.
L:  Yep, so --
R:  So, what do you do?
L:  I do push ups, I do, like, twenty sets of, like, ten and then sometimes I jog for, like, a good half an hour.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You?
R:  Well, I try to, um -- I have a job that I do a lot of traveling --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I -- I also have a lot of dinner appointments and stuff so I'm kind of on the run and eating out late and everything, so it's really tough for me to exercise regularly --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so what I try to do is, um, a lot on the weekend, so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I -- what I do is I -- I like to ride my bike for about an hour --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and now that it's summer I enjoy swimming.
L:  Oh, you too, oh, I swim in the winter though.  Yeah, it's much better in the winter to swim.
R:  It is, but when --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- y- y- y- y- you belong to, like, a YMCA or something?
L:  Yeah, usually it's the, um -- what do they call it -- the New York City Public, um [LIPSMACK] -- what's that thing -- Park, or something like that, I go to their, um, swimming pool indoors and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's much better.
R:  Yeah, I found out that in my town, somebody has an indoor pool --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like, it's -- like, it's an Olympic sized pool --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and that they're going to offer people to swim during the winter.
L:  As --
R:  So, I think I'm definitely going to do that.
L:  It's good, it's good.  It really is 'cause, like, when you're in there you want to swim more, you want to work out more, even though you should drink more water as well too 'cause you do get, um, dehydrated.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, it's really fun.  I think it's much better in the winter than the summer.
R:  Yeah, you don't like to -- to cool off in the summer and swim?
L:  Yeah, but, I'm mostly, like -- like you, I'm, like, mostly on the run at my work or if I'm not at work I'm at school so it's like,  you know --
R:  Oh, okay.  So, you -- you have it pretty hectic too?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  So, you do your exercises, like, wha- when -- when you get right up in the morning?
L:  Sometimes in the morning but mostly in between class and work.
R:  Uh, okay.  'Cause, you know, I'm not really a -- a -- a -- a morning person, I get up early bef- -- you know, some of these people can get up at five o'clock --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- work out for forty five minutes then they take their shower and they're ready to go.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I, like, stumble out of bed, have to ready --
L:  Mhm. [LAUGH]
R:  -- and then, you know, I have to get in to the city or I have to hit my appointments, so that's the problem.
L:  Sure.
R:  I do a lot of traveling at  -- my -- my territory is, uh, Connecticut, New Jersey --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- Long Island, so I'm all over the place and then I'm -- I'm catching, uh, flights and you know, all that kind of stuff --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so I just wish I could be consistent, like, just get up in the morning, do forty five --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- minutes and be done with it that would be ideal.  So, maybe that's one of the goals I should do.
L:  But you could do it all, um, when you're traveling as well, like, if -- do you drive by your -- yeah, do you drive by yourself or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- somebody drives for you?
R:  Yeah, you -- well sometimes I have, uh, clients or, you know, members of my team with me, but a lot times I'm by myself.
L:  Oh, 'cause sometimes, like, you could sit there, like, in your chair and just lift weights with one arm --
R:  That's an idea.
L:  -- and while you're driv- -- yeah, 'cause that's --
R:  Yeah, that's an idea.
L:  -- how I was doing it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.  You could use a five pound or use the -- you have to use a five pound then you slowly use the ten pounds and then you, like, slowly graduate --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- 'cause that's what I do and -- yeah.
R:  Yeah, that's good idea.  What kind of business are you in?
L:  Oh, I'm in the movie di- -- um, industry for Lowes Theaters.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, so it's like --
R:  I work for -- I work for, uh, an insurance company in corporate sales.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah, so it's like --
L:  So, you got to see a lot of people.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] A lot of those and you're, like, "Yo, look at my bills".
R:  Yeah, that's it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's it.
L:  Oh, goodness, wow.
R:  All the time.  And what school do you go to?
L:  I go to City Tech.  I'm majoring in dental hygiene.
R:  Uh, very good.  So, you have --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, something to fall back on.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I just want to do though, like, the movie scene, like, for a few more years probably --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- 'cause I got -- after I finish doing dental hygiene, I want to do low budget filming.
R:  Now, very good, very good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I've been doing, uh -- I've been doing this business for about, uh, twenty six years.
L:  Wow.  So, you know it like it's the back of your hand?
R:  Yeah, but there's always stuff that's going on.  There's always --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- like, new stuff that you learn and, uh, you know, there's always new techniques that come out and there's always technology and everything.  So, uh, you know, you got to -- you got to keep up with everything and, uh, you know, like, when I was in my twenties and thirties I had a lot more energy.  Now, I can see that, um, things you don't think about, now you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- start to think about.  You say, "Oh, you know, I really need to go out and walk and you know, not eat as much and, you know, watch what you eat".  I used to --
L:  I know.
R:  -- have a couple of cocktails, now I don't like to drink that much.  You know, I'll have a glass --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of wine here and there.
L:  Yeah, that is so true.  It's, like, I don't know, to me it feels like ever since Bloomberg got into that house it's like everybody's on their penny[?], everybody's on their cell --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and you've got to look back.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's like, "Hey".
R:  So, how -- how old are you?
L:  Oh, well I'm going on twenty on Saturday.
R:  Oh, you're -- you're a baby?
L:  [NOISE] A baby but I feel old. [LAUGH]
R:  You've got to be kidding me?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I got thir- I got thirty years on you so, you know, enjoy it, this is -- this is the -- this is the prime time.  I wo- -- I --
L:  I'm in the wrong time. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, now is the prime time, you can't -- you know, no -- no way -- you -- you -- you could go 'til six o'clock in the morning and get up --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- for work at eight, no -- no problem.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, you've got to be kidding me, no way.
L:  I always feel old, yeah.  Too old, do you hear that -- too old, no offence to your age.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] But I feel too old. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, so what -- so what do you consider young, fourteen?
L:  No, I think if I was to, like, stay a set age it probably would be, like, twenty two --
R:  Really.
L:  -- I could stay a set age of twenty two.
R:  That's a good age, yep.  Yeah, you got, like --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- all your future, you know what you could do and then -- and all that good stuff, yep.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, for me, thirty five is a good time, 'cause you're kind of established, you're still fairly young, you know --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- you don't give s- -- eh -- the thing is, it's -- the things you have to think about, given a second thought, is the stuff that bothers me.  So, it's like I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- was always active -- I'm still active , you know, we had a, um, barbecue for the Fourth of July, some of our friends came over and it was like -- they -- they're like -- almost like zombies the -- the way they moved.  They're all stiff --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, you know, all this and that and who's got a bad back, who's got a bad neck --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- you know, so it's, like, "Okay" --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- so they -- that's why I think it's very important to, um, you know, really watch your diet.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Are you a big eater?
L:  Only, like, at cookouts, yeah, cookouts and sometimes parties.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, but I get so --
R:  So, are you -- are you liv- are you living at home or are you on your own?
L:  Living at home, I wish, if this rent wasn't so crazy I would definitely be on my own.
R:  Yeah, the rent is -- is -- is outrageous.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, do you, um -- do you have to cook for yourself or does -- or does somebody cook for you?
L:  Oh, it's, like, on and off, because sometimes I come home so late, so by the time she even really cooks for me [LIPSMACK] I'm already, like, having the food already, like, from work or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I'm on the run, but --
R:  So, you're all taken care of?
L:  Yeah, but tonight I cooked for myself, I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- cooked some spaghetti and meatballs, yeah.
R:  Very good, very good.
L:  [several inaudible words], yeah.
R:  Yeah, yep, I just, uh, I had a -- I had a meeting yesterday, went late, I stayed into the city then I came home and I had, uh, pasta as well, then we're going to go out tomorrow to see some friends so, I was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- pretty -- pretty good, I didn't eat any dessert yesterday, I had some -- some fish and, you know, I was walking around, but, uh -- yeah, you gave me --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a good idea, I like that idea of, uh, lifting some weight, you know, hand weights in the car --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, um, I'm just going to try and get up, uh, in the morning and, uh, try to do at least a half an hour consistently and then we'll --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- see what happens.
L:  'Cause even when you're, like -- even sitting down watching TV or even if you're in your bed --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you can lift some, like, little weights --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- not too much though or you might, like, strain your shoulder.
R:  Yeah, no, that's a good idea.
L:  But, yeah, just little weights 'cause I was doing that and, like, now, it's, like, my arm is like a good tight fit.  So, I'm ready for volleyball season --
R:  There you go --
L:  'cause that might --
R:  -- do you -- do you play for your school?
L:  Yeah, so I'm, like, so on top now with my serves and it's like -- oh, you know how you do your serves and then -- and you know, instead of using, like, one hand to hold the ball --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- you just do the one hand serve and everybody's looking at you like, "Oh, she knows how to do them".
R:  Yeah, that's very good and you get a little bit more power --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and you're -- you know, you're -- you're probably a little more flexible so that's works out well.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  When does the season start?
L:  My season -- my season starts, um, September.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  So, it's like we're getting really pumped up --
R:  Yeah, that's good --
L:  -- and I know --
R:  -- that's good that you swim during the winter as well.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I'm so fit, oh, it's like you get so hyped up and so tight --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- like, "I want to play a game now, I want to play a game now, I'm doing good", you know, and it's like, "Whoa".
R:  That's it.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  That's the name of the game.  Now, how many -- how many other calls did you make so far to this service?
L:  Uh, no, this is my first one for tonight, yeah --
R:  Uh.
L:  -- 'cause, um, my sister hooked me up with this, so now, like --
R:  Yeah, no, it's pretty -- it's pretty -- it's pretty interesting.
L:  Well, I --
R:  There's some, uh, pretty good topics and, uh, you know, if you call late at night sometimes you, uh, catch somebody on the West Coast.
L:  Mm.
R:  I spoke to a lady from, uh, Oklahoma --
L:  Whoa.
R:  -- so it's real- really inter- it's really interesting to see how other -- other people, uh, view things.
L:  That's true.
R:  Y- you know they were talking about, uh, um, drugs and then another thing was about terrorism, so it's pretty interesting topics.
L:  Wow, so how long have you been doing this?
R:  Um, basically I just, um, started, um, about a week ago.
L:  Okay.
R:  My -- my sister, uh, and -- and, uh, my mother are doing it too --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and, uh, you know, so everybody's -- like it's all in the family.
L:  Oh, wow, you're mom? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, so it's like -- yeah, she's, like, seventy seven --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so my -- my -- my sister visits her and she kind of, like, sets up the --
