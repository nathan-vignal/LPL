R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  My name's Jeff.
R:  I'm Kate.
L:  Hello, Kate.  How are you?
R:  Nice to meet you.  How are you? [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm fine.  Nice to meet you.  Well, do you re-, uh, regularly exercise?
R:  Yeah, I do.  Now that I'm back, um, in Manhattan I -- I joined the gym once again and, yes, I'm exercising pretty much like three or four times a week, I guess.
L:  Okay.
R:  Or at least I try to.
L:  Sure.
R:  You know, not on the weekends but on the weekdays.  How about you? [LIPSMACK] 
L:  When I was in Manhattan I used to exercise about four days a week in the gym.  Um, since I've moved back to Atlanta I probably exercise about five days a week.
R:  Wow.
L:  Including one day, um, at the weekend.
R:  Yeah.  Wow. 
L:  So --
R:  That's very impressive.  I try but unfortunately I'm usually hung over. [LAUGH] 
L:  That happens to me quite a bit too and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- for some reason i- i- it to me it's a way to punish myself.
R:  Yeah.  No, it actually gets rid of the hang over --
L:  It does.
R:  -- more or less but, yeah, yeah, for me if -- if I go, yeah.  I- it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I feel much better afterwards but it -- it's the whole process of getting myself up and going.
L:  That's right.  Um, what --
R:  Where -- where in New York were you going to exercise, like which gym?
L:  Uh, well, when I was downtown it was at the World Trade Center Marriott.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Then when I lived in midtown it was at the Warwick Hotel gym.
R:  Oh, I don't really know where that is. [LAUGH] 
L:  It's at fifty four and six.
R:  Okay.  I just joined the Equinox here 'cause I'm back for the summer.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I -- I go to college.  Yeah, so there I exercise pretty much, you know, pretty often but --
L:  Sure.
R:  Um --
L:  What do you do?  Work -- uh, swim?
R:  I usually just take classes here.
L:  Okay.
R:  I -- I just -- I mean, it's -- I'm sorry, what do I do in terms of my life or --
L:  No, the -- at the gym.
R:  Oh, I usually take classes like kick boxing or Pilates and things like that.  Just whatever gets my heart pumping.
L:  Oh.
R:  And like ab classes, more or less.
L:  How is Pilates?  I've thought about doing that.
R:  It's -- it's a little boring I have to say but it definitely is good for the abs.  
L:  Really?
R:  I was never able to -- to take the yoga courses.  That bores me way too much.
L:  Sure.
R:  But -- but Pilates, yeah, if -- it's pretty good.  It's much better if you're able to take the machine classes but they're much more expensive.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah. [LIPSMACK] 
L:  Yeah, 'cause I've thought about it.  You know, the -- some infomercial out there selling the tape about --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- Pilates and I've debated --
R:  Yeah, the Daisy Fuentes one? [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  And I've --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- debated buying it.  
R:  Yeah.  I actually did too for a while.  I just -- I think it's not something you could do on your -- I wouldn't want to do it on my own.  It's a little boring.
L:  Okay.
R:  And it -- it takes a lot of like slow movements and a lot of discipline in terms of just the breathing and things like that.  So it's not -- it's not that fun. 
L:  Oh, sounds awful.
R:  Yeah, but I took the class yesterday and it really helps your stomach.  It does give you the nice muscle definition.  It's a bit torture some though.  
L:  [MN]
R:  I prefer classes where you, you know, jump up and down and move around.
L:  Sure.  I walk now but I need to, uh, used to do a hundred sit ups every day.  I need to get back to doing that, I guess.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I've -- what part of the city are you in?
R:  I'm -- I'm -- well, I live in Brooklyn but I'm in Manhattan doing an internship here.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So --
L:  Where are you doing your internship?
R:  New York Life Insurance.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Good deal[?].
R:  What were you doing in New York?
L:  Uh, [SIGH] the first time I worked for Cap Gemini and I was a project manager for the, um, Union of Government Employees up there.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  The Municipal Employees Union.  Second time I worked for IBM as a strategy consultant.
R:  Oh, okay.  Wow.
L:  But --
R:  It's quite -- quite -- very -- very -- like different sort of jobs, it seems. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, they both were in the consulting business.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, you know, one was pure project management, the other one went back to the --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- theoretical stuff I like to do.  So --
R:  Yeah, okay.
L:  How are we supposed to talk ten minutes about exercise?
R:  I have no idea about how much we exercise.  Just I -- I don't know.  Well, you ever done anything else?  I -- I used to hip hop dance for a while there.  
L:  I used to row and hit the exercise bike.  I still play golf at least once every two weeks.  I'm --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- thinking about starting to walk all eighteen holes.
R:  Yeah, I just started -- well, I just went golfing for the first time.  I just went to the driving range.  I was actually really good.  I was very --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- impressed with myself.  I -- I thought I would just be horrible at it but no I whacked those suckers pretty far. [LIPSMACK] 
L:  That's good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You were keeping your head down and swinging slow.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  And --
L:  [MN]
R:  I had -- I had quite a bad teacher but I still -- I don't know I guess I just got the whole flow of it and they're whacking out there like a hundred and fifty, two hundred, three hundred.  I mean, not three hundred but, you know, I -- I was --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- pretty good 'cause my mom was there with me too and she like, you know, she hit every, I don't know, fifth ball.  I was getting them all. [SIGH]
L:  That's impressive.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, 'cause I -- I played last weekend, um, it was a very mountainous course.
R:  Oh.
L:  But I sat there.  I had a, um, did a perfect drive --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- except there was a tool shed by the side of the fairway --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I bounced off of the roof of the tool shed --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- onto -- right to the edge of the green.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [COUGH] Then chipped to get on the green, went over the green --
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  -- on top of the h- -- you know, there was a hill slope on the other --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- side of the green.  Hit the top of the slope, rolled back down on the green.
R:  Oh, Jesus.  Wow.
L:  I was playing trick golf.
R:  Yep. [NOISE] 
L:  But I would like to get where I walk eighteen --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- holes.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  I was playing with a guy --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a few weeks ago.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  He got hit with food poisoning.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, I ended up walking fifteen holes of the round and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, it's actually -- just --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- gets faster.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Because I like in Atlanta and you play cart path golf here. 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Like you cannot put the -- take a cart out on the course right now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I was able to walk from the tee box to my ball, to my ball, to the green.
R:  Hm.
L:  Whereas the other two guys were having to get -- get back to the carts, drive to the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- next shot.
R:  I think it's -- I -- I would really just like to drive around in a cart.  You know, forget playing golf.  I just wanna run some people over. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, God.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Friend of mine rode with us a couple of weeks ago and that's all she did.  She just drove the cart.
R:  Oh, that would be so fun.  
L:  Yeah, she drove --
R:  I don't even -- I don't -- I don't think I'd ever like playing on the green it -- it bores me a little too much.  I don't have the concentration necessary for it but [MN] [LIPSMACK] definitely like the driving range a lot.  That was --
L:  Well, I --
R:  That was a good -- yeah.
L:  Yeah, and you get to hit the ball a lot.  That kind of thing.  So --
R:  Yeah, it's not much exercise though but my arms did hurt.  Uh, give it that.
L:  You're using different muscles doing that in --
R:  I know.  I just -- 
L:  -- in your back.  You're twisting it --
R:  I don't really care about those muscles that much. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, well, there you go.
R:  Yeah, you know, us women we care about our booties. [LIPSMACK] Unfortunately --
L:  Well, there you go.
R:  -- you don't really work in golf. [LAUGH] [LIPSMACK] 
L:  No.
R:  Not unless you're walking them hills.
L:  That's right.  And then you gotta be walking at least --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- twice a week.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  And then probably toting your own bag.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, I --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- would -- I -- that -- that wouldn't be so bad.  Although --
L:  We got --
R:  -- it would be nice to have someone carry it for you.
L:  We have a course here in Atlanta that you -- you cannot -- you can't get a -- they have no carts.
R:  Mhm.
L:  In fact there's only one member who gets to use a cart and that's 'cause he's eighty seven years old.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  You have to walk it but they do have caddies.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, you know, that at least I think makes it better for 'em.
R:  Yeah, I think I'd feel --
L:  But it --
R:  -- kinda bad though making someone else carry my stuff.  I don't know if I like that idea.
L:  Well, you know, if you tip 'em generously enough they don't mind it.
R:  I guess.  But I just -- I wouldn't like to.  I think that I could do it on my own.
L:  The only --
R:  Maybe.
L:  -- advantage to it is if you've never played the course before --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  The person can tell you -- you wanna go a hundred yards --
R:  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  -- straight.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  That kind of stuff.
R:  Yep.
L:  Um, but it -- it's, uh, it's quite a workout to do that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So --
R:  I can imagine so.
L:  Um, a friend -- a friend of mine plays golf three times a week and he has started walking it.  Um, but, you know, with the heat we have down here you sweat off ten pounds --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- doing that.
R:  Yeah.  How hot is it down there now?
L:  Uh, yesterday was ninety three.
R:  Okay, it's -- it's been like that in New York too.
L:  Well, there's -- I never found -- in the summer I never found that much of a temper -- temperature differential.
R:  Yeah, I don't think there is much.  And --
L:  In the winter it is.
R:  -- plus it's nasty and humid here, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I never liked walking up there in the, um, [LIPSMACK] summer.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah --
L:  Because you had to walk --
R:  No, not at all. [NOISE] 
L:  You had to walk at like five thirty in the morning.
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE] 
L:  Just to keep from sweating to death.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  My ex wife was a big runner --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and she would -- she would literally leave to go running by five thirty.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, you see those people definitely.  So, I think everybody's at the gym in the summer.  They're packed.
L:  Yeah, I listen --
R:  It doesn't --
L:  -- to Imas[?] every morning and he talks about it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Although he's out in, um, New Mexico now.  So --
R:  Mm.
L:  Well, he owns a ranch.  So --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, there -- there's a workout.
R:  I'm sure.  I don't really know what ranchers do but I mean --
L:  I have no idea either.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I don't ever really hope to find out.  So --
R:  [LAUGH] Uh --
L:  I think we --
R:  Yeah, so, uh, you into any -- any winter sports?
L:  Never have been.  I grew up in Atlanta.  We don't have enough winter to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I -- I literally -- other than -- I literally play golf twelve months a year.
R:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, yeah, I mean, we have some skiing in North Carolina but it just doesn't compare to what you can do anywhere else.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I worked with a guy.  Now he -- his hobby was cross country skiing.
R:  I can't -- oh, that's so boring.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ugh.
L:  He was Lithuanian by origin so I think it was, uh, something that reminded him of home.
R:  Yeah, that's very possible.  I'm from the Ukraine originally so people used to --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- do that there.  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  There's a lot of snow so I remember when we were younger 'cause, you know, if you live in the city you can just kinda do it anywhere. [LAUGH] 
L:  Exactly.
R:  You -- you can do it to school. [SIGH] 
L:  [MN]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  Nasty winters but, I don't know.  I -- I took up snow boarding for a while.  That was fun.
L:  That's -- that -- it -- fun?
R:  It was great.
L:  I mean, it looks fun.
R:  It was great. [NOISE] 
L:  Hm.
R:  It was -- it was incredible.  I loved it so much until one time I went up to Stover Mont and, um, I got into this big car accident.  Almost killed these two Canadian pe-
