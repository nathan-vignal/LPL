R:  [NOISE] Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  [COUGH] Uh, hi.  I didn't hear --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the question, um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it was blurred.
L:  It's w- it's -- it's what [NOISE] do you do to stay healthy and [NOISE] do you exercise regularly and stuff.
R:  Oh, okay.  So, are we supposed have a dialogue or am I supposed to --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- just talk nonstop.
L:  [NOISE] [COUGH] No, we just talk to each other about it for [NOISE] ten minutes and then they [NOISE] send us a ten dollar check.
R:  Oh, nice --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- okay.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  So, uh, what do I do?  Um, um, I --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I'm conscious of health --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- very --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and I live --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- in California where [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- there's lots of --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- interest in health and holistic approaches --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and [SIGH] outpa- um--
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] organic and things like that --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- how about you?
L:  [NOISE] Uh, well, I don't really watch what I eat because I'm seventeen and I just, like -- I sometimes [NOISE] exercise, but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- not a lot. [NOISE] 
R:  You're --
L:  And --
R:  -- seventeen you said?
L:  Right.
R:  I'm sixty seven --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- we're quite a match --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- here. [LAUGH] [SIGH] Where --
L:  And --
R:  -- do you live?
L:  [NOISE] Um, in Florida.
R:  I'm in California.  I just said that, so, [SIGH] um, [SIGH] I watch what I eat --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um, you don't need to exercise probably if it's --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- built into your lifestyle.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  Um, but I -- I've -- all my life --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- have eaten healthy [MN] kinds of foods, low on sugar, low on, um, really --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- over processed kinds of things. [SIGH] Um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I walk a lot, um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I do some stretches --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I keep my weight --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- at a reasonable level --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I meditate.
L:  [NOISE] I -- I sometimes watch what I eat [NOISE] but I'm u- I eat [NOISE] a lot of sugar, [NOISE] I eat -- I like candy.
R:  Does it really wire you?
L:  [NOISE] No, but I, like, [NOISE] eat it a lot.  Like, I b- I eat candy all day. [NOISE] 
R:  Are you --
L:  But j-
R:  -- heavy?  Are you overweight?
L:  [NOISE] No, I'm, like, five six or five seven, I weigh, like, [NOISE] one twenty.
R:  Uh-huh.  So, the sugar doesn't 
L:  [NOISE] Right, it doesn't affect me, it just gives me energy. [NOISE] 
R:  Have you tried --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- like, complex --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- carbohydrates instead of the --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- refined sugar?
L:  [NOISE] No.
R:  Do you just --
L:  I mean I eat a lot of everything, [NOISE] like, potatoes [NOISE] and everything. [NOISE] 
R:  And beans and grains --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and things like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that?  Yeah.
L:  I like beans. [NOISE] Do you like beans? [NOISE] 
R:  Yes, but not as much as some of the, um, wheat and rice and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I try to mix --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um, beans and grains --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] beans and grains --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- to make protein.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  So 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I eat a lot of chicken, I don't like -- I don't really like other meats.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  They're too, [NOISE] like, chewy [NOISE] and [NOISE] I don't know.
R:  And what about sleep, that's really important --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- to help, do you pay attention?
L:  Well, not as -- n- not summertime, I don't get a lot of sleep.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I go to bed, like, three in the morning and wake up at, like, seven, but then I go back to sleep until, like, eleven, so, I mean, I get -- I give my body enough sleep.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  And then I don't do anything during the day, so  [NOISE] 
R:  What, you --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- y- you do --
L:  I'm more active [NOISE] during the school year.
R:  You mean you're a couch potato all summer?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Not --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- bored?
L:  [NOISE] What?
R:  Are you not bored just hanging --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- around?
L:  Oh, I a- I am bored c there's nothing to do [NOISE] around here. [NOISE] 
R:  You live in a small town?
L:  [NOISE] Uh, it's somewhat small [NOISE] but it's like -- there's nothing to do [NOISE] in the -- [NOISE] in the city, but, like, [NOISE] if you leave a -- like, ten [NOISE] -- [MN] drive ten minutes [NOISE] you can go to, like, mall [NOISE] or something. [NOISE] 
R:  Uh-huh.  So, h- h- hanging out and doing nothing --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- isn't really good for --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- your health either.  I mean, boredom --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] [MN] just -- [MN] people --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- most people who are healthy [SIGH] have involved in active --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- kinds of life --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- mentally and phy- physically.
L:  [NOISE] No.
R:  Have you thought about volunteering, or doing service to your community?
L:  [NOISE] My parents tell me I should do that [NOISE] but then, uh, I don't know.
R:  So, I'm sounding like a parent, [LAUGH] aren't I? [LAUGH] 
L:  I just don't get a round to it.  I don't -- because, like, I wake up too late [NOISE] -- it's too late, so I don't know. [NOISE] 
R:  Well, if it's the end of the day, you f-
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you signed up for --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- something to do the next --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- day.
L:  Right.
R:  Or the next week, you know.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  You don't sound very motivated.
L:  [NOISE] I'm not, I'm very lazy actually. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] Well, lazy --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I don't know, I don't know if people are born lazy, I think lazy is -- is --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- is not connecting to something --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that really you --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- want to do.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  How do you do in school?  What are your -- what subjects do you like?
L:  Um, straight As, [NOISE] I don't know.  I do good in school, it's not -- like, [MN] if I'm required to do something I'll do it, but, like, if I don't have to I just, like [NOISE] don't do anything.
R:  Straight As in --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- school, so my guess is your smart, then, and maybe school doesn't --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- challenge you enough.
L:  Exactly. [NOISE] 
R:  So, I think you need something extra curricula that's going to really excite --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you.  Like, is it compu- you like computers --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you like --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- science --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- music --
L:  Yeah, I like [NOISE] --
R:  -- art?
L:  [NOISE] I like computers, but I [NOISE] -- they don't have any good computer, uh, classes in my school.
R:  Do you -- do --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you do a lot online, um --
L:  Yeah, I'm --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- on my [NOISE] computer, like -- I don't watch TV, I'm on my computer all day. [NOISE] 
R:  I am, too.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I really like --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the computer stuff. [SIGH] I've --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- been following the election campaign of Howard Dean --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- Dean for America --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- dotcom --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and how they, [SIGH] um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- are using electronic, um, networking --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- to build support for his campaign.  I think it's a --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- very interesting use of the int- the internet --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and the technologies.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Are we supposed to stay on topic here?  Have you done this before?
L:  Um, [NOISE] it's -- like, after ten minutes there's, like [NOISE] -- it's suppo- like, I read online, like, it just, like, [NOISE] says, like, "Okay, now say goodbye" and then you just hang up after ten minutes, so I think it's only been, like, seven. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, I know, I know that, but we're not -- we're --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- talking broadly about health and fitness --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] in --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- terms of mental health and fitness --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- but not --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] exactly --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, how many minutes of [SIGH] aerobic exercise [LAUGH] we do.  I -- I don't know [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I don't know whether that matters.
L:  [NOISE] Well, a lot of Americans are overweight because of all the [NOISE] fast foods that they eat. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, there's been a lot in --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the papers recently --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- about that.
L:  Right, and they're trying to make [NOISE] healthier foods, and [NOISE] something about putting, like, [NOISE] the complex -- uh, uh, like, polyunsaturated fat labels on the food [NOISE] now, or something. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.  would that help you?  Would you pay attention if the food was labeled?
L:  [NOISE] Uh, a little more, but not, like, too much.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [LIPSMACK] What do other kids think about kids who are fat?
L:  [NOISE] Uh, they usually make fun of them around here.  Like, uh, just, like, joking, though. [NOISE] Like, one of my friends is overweight and, like, we just joke with him, but he knows we're -- he doesn't really care, though.  Like, he [NOISE] doesn't try to [NOISE] lose weight or anything. [NOISE] 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Are there a lot of, um, exercise --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- gym classes --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- during the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- school day?
R:  [NOISE] Uh, during the school day?
L:  Yeah, do they --
R:  There are a few, but, like, there are a lot of gyms in my city, there are, like, five or six. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah, but [MN] the kids don't --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- do that, do they --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- go to gyms?
L:  Well, one -- one of my friends [NOISE] goes to -- he goes to the gym, like, [NOISE] every day.  He -- [NOISE] he weighed, like, one ninety six and now he's down to, like, one sixty. [NOISE] 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE] So, he lost a lot of it.
R:  And he's nice and trim?
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  He looks good.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  But you're not into that?
L:  I mean, I went -- I was [NOISE] -- I joined that gym before him and then he came and joined too --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- but then, like, I stopped going [NOISE] because I was --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- just got lazy. [NOISE] I don't know.
R:  Well, I don't like --
L:  Just don't. [NOISE] 
R:  -- the idea, uh, I'll do things at home, like, in the morning, [SIGH] you know, some kind of --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- at home routine, but, [SIGH] um, the idea of getting dressed, going to a gym [SIGH] --
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  -- doing stuff, taking a shower --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- changing clothes again, [MN] I would never --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- never do that.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] Um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- but I've always had a little bit of --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- home routine, some stretches to stay [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, reasonably limber.  Um --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  -- and -- and weight I manage mostly by watching what I eat.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I know, like, I used to weigh, like, one forty, but then, like, all of a sudden I just dropped all the weight [NOISE] and now I just [NOISE] -- it stays off I guess. I don't know --
R:  -- Yeah.
L:  -- I don't really -- [NOISE] I don't really pay attention. [NOISE] 
R:  Well, you're lucky if you --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- don't have to, um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- but so- some people's --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- bodies seem to just --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- turn everything to fat.
L:  [NOISE] Right. [NOISE] 
R:  I think there's a lot --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- we don't really --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- understand about [COUGH] how --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- what you put in your mouth --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, what stays on --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- as weight and what gets burnt --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- off.
L:  [NOISE] Right. [NOISE] 
R:  [LIPSMACK] What am I hearing --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- in the background? [SIGH] 
L:  Uh, I don't know, I'm [NOISE] --
R:  Oh, there's --
L:  -- at a mall. [NOISE] 
R:  -- oh, you're at the mall?
L:  [NOISE] Right.  I'm just walking around [NOISE] talking. [NOISE] 
R:  Did you call into --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the eight hundred number?
L:  No, they called me.
R:  They called you?   Oh, oh.
L:  [LIPSMACK] 'Cause, like, when I signed up I put my cell phone number, so they called me.
R:  [SIGH] Oh, that's nice --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that's nice --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- well, I just --
L:  [NOISE] So, it --
R:  -- dialed in --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and it took, um --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, no, I saw the eight hundred numbers so you don't have to wait around [NOISE] for the call. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, yeah, and -- and it took them several minutes I guess [NOISE] to find someone --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] so I was just kind of waiting.  This is the first time I hear about this, this morning, and I dialed in to see how it would work --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- out.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE] So, hopefully [NOISE] it'll w-
