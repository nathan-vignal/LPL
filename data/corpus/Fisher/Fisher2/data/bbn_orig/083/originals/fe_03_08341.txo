R:  Hi.  I'm Sarah from Pittsburgh.
L:  Hi, Sarah.  I'm David, New York City.
R:  Okay.  Hello. [LAUGH] Um --
L:  I'm surprised to hear a woman's voice --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- 'cause the questionnaire said, "Men only".
R:  Oh.  Wait -- what -- what said, "Men only"?
L:  The -- the questionnaire that -- that I had to fill out that said, "Men only".  It didn't say like -- at least I thought it was but --
R:  Oh.  Hm --
L:  Interesting. [NOISE]
R:  Well, you know what?  I actually didn't even hear of this from -- I didn't fill out any questionnaire. [LAUGH] I just was given a phone number by [LIPSMACK], um, somebody I knew. 
L:  There you go.
R:  And they said this was going on so, yeah, I guess, um -- yeah, I actually spoke to a woman yesterday 'cause I called and did it yesterday.  So 
L:  A friend -- so, I got an email to which I responded I suppose and then they said they would send me a confirmation and I get a phone call even before a confirmation but --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, okay.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, they were real quick.  But, um, yeah, yesterday I talked to a lady from Detroit and the day before that I talked to, um, a kid out in California. [LAUGH] So --
L:  There you go.
R:  -- it must be a pretty -- pretty nationwide study, I guess.  But [LAUGH], um 
L:  So, what was the topic?  
R:  Uh --
L:  Health and fitness and whether or not we exercise --
R:  You exercise.
L:  -- regularly and if so --
R:  And if we don't -- or, yeah, if so what do we do?
L:  What do we do?  And if not, what are we going to do?
R:  Right, right.  Well --
L:  There you go.
R:  Um, tonight I'm actually supposed to have an -- uh, go and do aerobics class but I'm skipping it 'cause I'm going to a concert. [LAUGH]
L:  There you go.
R:  But I do -- do -- ever -- you know, usually though I do go at -- twice a week, Monday and Wednesday to that class so I do that. [LAUGH]
L:  That's good.
R:  But --
L:  I wonder if they actually expect people to talk about the topic or if they wanna see how the conversation flows, stemming from the initial ice breaker.
R:  Oh that's tr- -- I don't know.  That's a good question.  You know, this is -- they said I had to make, you know, three calls you would do.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's what I was told.  Um --
L:  And they would give us topics.
R:  Yeah, and I really -- like the last two -- you know, this is the third one.  This is the last one I have to make and I, um, I really was -- I had just kinda took their word like, "Okay".  And I was -- I had one on -- on marriage and like what I think about the divorce rate.  I'm only twenty five and I'm not, you know, planning on getting married.  I really didn't have [LAUGH] very many thoughts on it. [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I was really -- and the -- the kid I was talking to was nineteen.  He was like a college student [LAUGH] so we're like, "Um".  It was hard to fill the ten minutes. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, and --
R:  But we were trying. [LAUGH]
L:  You chat on one topic and then you move onto the next, I suppose.
R:  I guess, yeah.
L:  Talk about love and dating and the rest of it.
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH] So, I guess the answer, uh, if -- if I'm supposed to answer the, uh, the question properly --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I do exercise but not as regularly as I used to.
R:  Right.
L:  Used to belong to a gym, used to go three, four times a week to the typical aerobic as well as weight training and occasionally a class here and there.  I think I was doing abdominal classes and spinning classes.
R:  Oh, I've taken spinning before.
L:  Yeah, which is a very -- it's --
R:  That's not my favorite. [LAUGH] I -- it's --
L:  It's tough.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I don't like -- I'm not a big -- even the -- when I just go to the gym.  I don't belong right now but I have.  I always avoided the stationary bikes.  I just don't like them so the spinning class wasn't really for me but --
L:  Well, the spinning class [MN] it wasn't just cycling as you would if you were off on your own in -- in the, um, in the room with all the cardio equipment.  It was --
R:  Right.
L:  It's a little more involved and it's a great workout.  People come out of there dripping wet.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I bet.  I don't know.  I like to -- when I belonged to the gym I was offered more classes.  I -- 'cause I like the Thai bo like any of those like kinda cardio kick boxing type things and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I like step aerobics.  Yeah, it's pretty, you know, boring.  I guess, probably in New York City you probably have better options as far as, uh --
L:  There are a lot of different --
R:  -- classes. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- gyms.  The -- the --
R:  Yeah, probably have more cutting edge type of things than we do here in Pittsburgh but [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, the, um, the premium gyms, the ones that they'll get you for fifteen hundred dollars a year --
R:  [SIGH] My God.
L:  -- have some extraordinary classes and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the instructors float from various -- from one gym to another.  Sometimes with the same organization, sometimes instructors who teach at different gyms.
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.
L:  But, yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  I mean, it's -- it's --
R:  I'm t- --
L:  -- a big business here.
R:  Yeah.  You bet and for that kind of money.  You know, here that's, you know, gym memberships here are like, you know -- you know, like four hundred dollars a year.  It's pretty much like the standard.
L:  To -- yes, I mean, to get -- the lowest full service, um, gym with like pretty much state of the art equipment but without the water, uh --
R:  [SIGH] Right.
L:  -- amenities, you could do probably for maybe six but more likely like seven, eight hundred.
R:  Wow.  That's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- pretty -- for the -- for the bo- [LAUGH] -- for the bottom of the barrel that's, um --
L:  Well, there -- no, there -- there's -- there are bottom of the barrel gyms but those are the ones --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- that are   I mean, like, um, uh, there's a chain called New York Sports which is -- is fairly good and there's another, I mean, one called Crunch which I think is national --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- now.
R:  Yeah, I've heard of that.  Yeah.
L:  Crunch is -- is fairly good value but they don't have, um, they don't have the water. 
R:  [SIGH]
L:  They don't have the steam and the -- actually they might have steam or sauna but they don't have a pool.  Actually they probably don't have steam, sauna.  They don't have whirl pools and that kind of thing.
R:  Yeah, right.  And I guess[?] if you just go in for the, um, you know, I -- well, swimming can be good.  I do- -- actually don't even know how to swim. [LAUGH] 
L:  Three you go.
R:  W- -- so --
L:  Maybe that should be your next class.
R:  Yeah, right.  Learn how to swim. [LAUGH] Well, the -- the class I take is pretty -- it's pretty cheesy.  I -- I work at like University of Pittsburgh and, um, it just -- if you're an employee or the students --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- here.  You know, they have like -- they're kind of like -- they're not too bad but they're, you know, little gyms that you can use for free.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, um, and then they offer a few classes and they're -- you do pay for the classes but they're pretty cheap but -- so, it's just kind of luck and instructor at a gym but I actually really like the girl.  She does a good class though.  I just did it once and -- and just kind of kept up with it.  I've been doing it for like -- probably like about a year now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So --
L:  That's the important thing is to keep on doing it 'cause I was pretty religious about doing it and then I kind of slacked off.  If you're in a routine --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- stay in it at all costs --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  'Cause it's getting back in that's always the hard part.
R:  Oh, I know.  I've done myself like many times like I'll, you know, summer comes around and, you know, I'm like "Okay, gotta work out again".  You know, but then soon as like it's hitting like January February [LAUGH] it's always a little tough to like go out there in the snow and [LAUGH] get motivated to exercise. [SIGH] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, I suppose being single is always a good motivator.  
R:  [SIGH]
L:  If you're not -- if you're not --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in a steady relationship.
R:  Right, that's -- gotta keep --
L:  Y- y- you tend to work --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- on things to improve yourself.
R:  Right.  That's true.  You don't have anyone you can just get, uh, comfy with and just, you know --
L:  That's right.
R:  Who cares? [LAUGH]
L:  You both get fat together, right?
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  Don't get too comfortable and you get --
R:  Watch TV. [LAUGH] But, um, sit on the couch.  But, yeah, so, um, I'd like to exercise a little more regularly though.  I always think there's room for more. [LAUGH] 
L:  There is.  I think and -- and it's finding something that you enjoy doing, whether -- I mean, I also, aside from the gym I mean I like to play ball.  So, that's the easiest way.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So, I play a lot of volleyball which I do on a regular basis.  So, even though I'm not in the gym I'm still active.
R:  Yeah, that's cool.  Definitely.
L:  Try and run.  Get outside and do something, although the city's not the greatest place to run unless you go into one of the parks.
R:  Yeah, I know.  That's like a problem.  I actually have started doing that myself like in the past couple of months is try to run on the days I don't have that class, um, here and there.  But that's what I hate about running just out in public is like -- and I'm sure in New York City where it's congested a lot more than here but like just the car fumes and that.  It doesn't make --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for a very pleasant running experience.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Not only that you --
R:  And everyone staring at you like they've never seen a person running before.
L:  Well, I don't think it's so much that but I think it's dodging pedestrians and cars and whatever else is going on in the street --
R:  Right, yeah, that's true.
L:  -- which is --
R:  I know like there isn't a lot of sidewalks really any at all [LAUGH] where I live and so you're pretty much just out on the street with the cars.  Yeah, it's not the safest situation ever.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] But, um, [SIGH] anyhow though.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hm, okay, wonder how many minutes that's been. [LAUGH]
L:  I don't -- I wasn't playing close attention.
R:  I know.
L:  [NOISE] I know when the call originally came in it was three fifty but it -- I was in the middle of something so I stalled for the, uh, thirty seconds.  So, I'm guessing that we might have a minute or two to go.
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, that's --
L:  We'll see.
R:  -- not too bad.
L:  We'll see.
R:  I, um, I gave a friend of mine this number too because I thought, "Hey, this is just easy way to earn an extra couple of bucks", you know, and I -- and he called yesterday.  I was actually with him at the time.  It was like, "I'm gonna call, you know, just do it".  And [SIGH] they -- they did like they did with me.  They'll say like, "Oh, introduce yourself.  Say where   And, uh, and they, uh, and -- so he did but then there was no one on the line and so he just talked to himself for ten minutes. [LAUGH]
L:  I wonder if he'll get credit for that.  
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I'm s- -- the computer should've recognized that nobody was on the line.
R:  That's what I was saying and I said, "Well, hang up".  And he was like, "Well, you know, they -- they told me I could only call once a day".  He was like, "I wanna call and get it over with".  You know, just make like --
L:  Oh, I haven't even received the email telling me the instructions with like --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- my code and all that.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Oh, you know what?  Actually I didn't give them my -- my regular email account.  Maybe it did come in.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  'Cause I -- I was a little leary.  I mean, I -- I saw -- I went to the website and I saw where --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it was coming from but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I still wasn't proof positive that it was, uh, a hundred percent legit.  Yeah, I can see their email did come in already.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [inaudible] go check my other account.
R:  Yeah, I don't know.  Well, honestly all I -- I really don't know anything about it.  I didn't even know a website.  I was just given an eight hundred number from somebody I just knew from my work.  He really didn't say much.  He just like, "Oh, here, you know, call this.  You just talk on the phone.  Ten minutes each, ten bucks each ti- -- you know".  I was like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "Okay".  But I really have no [LAUGH] idea.  The woman called me back and she just explained it was like a voice recognition study.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, pretty much -- I'm not exactly sure what they're doing with it but -- I know, I actually work in research myself.
L:  Well, they have a website that you can consult.
R:  Uh, what's the website?
L:  Uh --
R:  Do you know what it's called?  Or do you know offhand?
L:  Yeah, I can look for the email that I originally got but now I look -- I'm looking at their email says they want us to speak about the original topic for at least eight minutes.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] Okay, well let's --
L:  So, we might -- we might get, uh, yelled at for this one.
R:  Uh-oh.
L:  But the email address --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  Uh
