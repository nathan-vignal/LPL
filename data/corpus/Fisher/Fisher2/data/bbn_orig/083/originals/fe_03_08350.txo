L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  Hi, I --
L:  Hi.
R:  -- I'm Laura from Missouri.
L:  I'm Mivca[?] and I'm from Michigan but I'm in New York right now. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] Your -- what's your name?
L:  Mivca.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's a hard one sorry.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, have you ever done this before?
R:  No, I haven't. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, me neither.  Hey, why not, right?
R:  Health and fitness. [LAUGH]
L:  Um, yeah.  Do you exercise regularly?
R:  No, how about you?
L:  [LAUGH] No, not at all.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, of course I want to but it's not like a big priority in my life and I just --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- never find time to or when I do find the time I'm like, "Ah, the gym can wait" you know.
R:  Yeah, I don't make the time.
L:  [MN] You don't have the time?
R:  I don't make the time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I have -- I'm a homemaker so I could find the time I just don't.  It's like you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's not a priority --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean --
R:  -- anymore, although --
L:  -- I -- I live --
R:  -- it should be.
L:  -- right next to gym. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Wow.
L:  Like, the -- it's -- uh, have you heard of it, it's Paladium.  It's in the New York dorms and it's --
R:  No.
L:  -- this new huge facility and it's supposed to be so nice and I haven't even set foot in it and I've been here for over --
R:  Oh wow.
L:  -- two months. [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  See my -- I live too far away to drive to some place --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to work out so if I do work out it's walking around the roads around here and video tapes so ...
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, walking is actually something that I really don't mind doing.  Like last year I went to Europe for the summer and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- basically, yeah, I liked toured around Europe and it was so wonderful, I had such a great time but, like, they have, like, public transportation and I didn't have a car there and, I mean, it just works out perfectly.  I got so much exercise, I lost so much weight, it was so awesome and then I got back --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and obviously I wasn't walking as much and so [LIPSMACK], I mean, it's --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- just -- it -- it feels so good when you're actually doing it.  It just takes so much out effort --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to, like, actually get yourself to get up and do this.
R:  Mhm, yeah.  That is so true.
L:  I don't know, do you eat healthy?
R:  I try, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  That's a lot easier, I thin- well, I'm a vegetarian so, I mean --
R:  Oh, I'm the opposite. [LAUGH]
L:  Ha, ha, I --
R:  I'm a low carb. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, no that's meant to be good, I mean --
R:  So, I do the high meat foods.
L:  Yeah.  The low carb is really good.  I mean, I try to do that but it's not, like, that easy for a vegetarian but, I mean, you live on, like, meats and -- like especially if they're chicken and fish and all those things [NOISE], I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- those are so good for you.  I wish I could include those in my diet but I -- I get sick if I think about eating living things.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [MN] I don't know why.
R:  Yeah, I have two sisters --
L:  It's weird.
R:  -- that are, uh, vegetarian [NOISE] too so ...
L:  Uh, yeah, I mean, it's not hard --
R:  So, I'm used to it though.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I -- I have like a few staple foods I always eat like veggie burgers and, like, I try and find low fat foods obviously.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, I mean, I eat pretty healthily, I think, except for, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- obviously, my chocolate intake because every woman's got to have chocolate, right?
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, I agree. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Like, here I am sitting with my, like, Ferrero Roche [LAUGH], like --
R:  [MN] Your what?
L:  Yeah.  Ferrero Roche, have you ever tried them?
R:  Oh okay, oh my goodness, oh. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, they're -- they're wonderful.
R:  Oh, they sure are.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I'm obsessed with them, [LAUGH] they're so bad for you --
R:  Well --
L:  -- but --
R:  -- do you think that, um, exercise decrea- people when -- as they get older they don't -- they aren't as active --
L:  Yeah, I do think so --
R:  -- you know.
L:  -- because I think that they have busier lifestyles, especially --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like I'm in college right now and I have so much free time and I feel like it's so much easier to find the time to go to the gym but n- right now I'm working a nine to five job and it just -- I get home and I'm so tired and I just wanna sit around and do nothing and, like, lounge, basically.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, I mean, I feel like that way at school but I think that's it just so much more -- like it's so much easier when you're in college or when you're in school to find the time rather than, like, a nine to five job or, like, taking care of children, I mean, like, that's a full time job, it's like, uh -- like I -- I just feel like there's so much less time when you get older.  Like my mom, I mean, she finds time to do everything.  I guess, like if you wanna find the time you can find the time --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- but I think that as you get older you have more responsibilities up until, like, you retire obviously but, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you have all these more responsibilities and it's not -- I -- I mean, you've so many other things going on in your life and I also think that when you're younger you want to stay fit and healthy maybe 'cause, like, you haven't found someone that you wanna marry or, like -- you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like, you feel like you have --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- to look good and so that's a lot of motivation for somebody to go and work out.  And once, like, you're older, like, priorities change somewhat.  I mean, there are still obviously people who aren't married and they're older --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but I think that those people would probably exercise more than those who are married and people who have been married for a while and are in a very stable relationship --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because -- 'cause I think that is a motivation for some people, don't you think so?
R:  Oh yeah, and then I think when people turn a certain age the- 'cause when I turned forty, this past year, it was, "Oh my gosh, I've gotta start getting myself into shape [LAUGH] and get more healthy".
L:  Yeah.
R:  Healthier --
L:  And --
R:  -- because I have been eating better but --
L:  Yeah, it's really important --
R:  -- lack of exercise but I -- I quit exercising so ...
L:  Yeah.  I think the -- like my mom she takes, like, uh, vitamin supplements because she knows she doesn't get, [MN] like, all the vitamins she needs and she actually she started working -- she's fifty and she started working out and she'd be like -- is taking, like, all these classes and, like, trying to get herself back in shape and I don't really think it's a mid life crisis, I think it's just that she needs to find a way to -- like, not feel good about herself but, like, find a way to stay healthy because that's really important to her.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause, I mean, I think --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like, I've seen pictures of her and she was -- she was skinner than I was at my age, like she was so fit and so healthy and she looked, like, wonderful and now, like, her bone structure has changed and she has, like, heavier -- I mean, she looks a lot heavier than she did when she was younger and I don't know what changed but, like, I feel like her body changed.  And --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I don't think it's an issue for her but I think that she wants to stay fit and stay active because that's, like, an important part of her life and now that she's like -- she has all this extra time and, like, she's planning on retiring and she wants to get in a, like, good, healthy lifestyle.  I think -- I mean --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and I also think that people once they retire they --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- get healthier because, like, they have all this extra time and they don't know what to do with it and they're like, "Wow, you know, I -- if I want to stay in good condition, my body's getting older, I need to start doing stuff that's helping it".  And exercise is so -- they -- I mean, they've done all these studies, it's so important to do, to, like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- stay healthy and, like, you live longer.  I mean, it's just -- it's just a matter of fact and, like, once the rea- -- like, hits you at, like, fifty, you're like, [LIPSMACK] "I'd better start doing it.  I better start taking care of myself".
R:  [LAUGH] That's how I felt at forty.  I went out and bought a -- a scale. [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  'Cause my original one broke. [LAUGH] That I had had since I was a teenager --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, so -- [NOISE]
L:  You -- you what?
R:  I had the other scale since I was a teenager so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I had it for quite a while. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  No, I -- I mean, I think it really is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I -- it hits you at some time, you're just like, "I gotta do this, I gotta --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- stay in shape.  I got --" and I al- I -- so I think it's more like when you're younger and then when you are older, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like in things, like, a middle age when you're just like, "Oh, I'm happy".
R:  Yeah, where you're health doesn't matter now because you're young and healthy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But then when you get to a certain age it's like, "Oh my gosh, I'm not as young as I used to be" and --
L:  Exactly.  I --
R:  -- a little -- I can't eat like I used to [SIGH] and not gain the weight either so ...
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, that's scary. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know how I'm gonna deal with that 'cause I eat a lot.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I think it's just -- it's also like rat- like a rationing, like, with people.  I -- I feel like if there's food in front of you you're gonna eat it, you know, if not -- it's just, uh, it's a habit, at least for me.  I mean, I put --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- food in front of me and I'm gonna -- like they tel- you know, how they tell you not to eat out of the bags and, like, put it in -- put, like, chips in something so you know how much you're eating and you're not just blindly grabbing --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- for the bag.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause that's a killer.  I mean, those are, like, so many extra calories and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't know, fast food I think is killing our nation. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  It's so awful.
R:  Definitely.  All that fat.
L:  Oh my god, like one meal --
R:  The hydrogenated fat --
L:  -- is -- is too much for a day, you know, like, one meal.
R:  Oh yeah.  Mhm.
L:  I mean, it's -- on- -- you could be, like, working off one meal for, like, two days and it just --
R:  Oh yeah.  Well, I don't get the bread anymore and I don't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- get the French fries.  Well, hal- I share a half -- I share a small fries --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with my son, so ...
L:  It's hard, I mean, 'cause --
R:  It is.
L:  -- we're a nation raised to, like, love this kind of food and love, like, having fatty things in us but, like, we also are a nation that does huge portions.  Like, you -- they offer you double size, super size --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- king size, whatever and I just --
R:  And it's cheaper to buy the bigger sizes sometimes --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- than to buy 'em separately, like, uh, hamburger with just water --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- and maybe share a fries.
L:  Yeah, it's --
R:  Rather than getting the --
L:  -- and it's awful.
R:  -- the super size meal. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, so [LIPSMACK] --
L:  They for sur- they for sure make it very hard and I think that a lot of companies are realizing that and, like, trying to make the products healthier.  And, like -- and also the government's realizing it and I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just read an article today and they're gonna start put- making, um, companies put the trans fat, like how much trans fat --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- this -- it's this really awful fat for you. 
R:  Oh.
L:  So, they're making them put them on ...
