R:  [LIPSMACK]  A- a- and I'm going to be a Junior at NYU in the fall.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Um, hi.  [LAUGH]
R:  Hi, How are you?  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm good.  How are you?  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  I'm good.  Wh- [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]  Have you done this before?
R:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Yeah, I did it one time before.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Have you?  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I did once.  Um, ...  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  Oh, you -- you've done it more than three times --
L:  No, I've --
R:  -- just that.  [NOISE]
L:  -- done it once.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH]  Okay, so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- health and fitness.  [NOISE]  So, --
R:  [LAUGH]  So, do you exercise?  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  Um, I actually don't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- on a r- regular basis --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but I do, like, walk a lot --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, um, [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] like, sometimes when I'm at my house --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'll just do a bunch of situps --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- at a time.  [NOISE]  But I don't have --
R:  [NOISE]  How old are you?  [NOISE]
L:  I'm twenty two.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  Oh, okay.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  A- ah --
L:  Well, how about you?  [SIGH]
R:  I'm -- I'm twenty and [SIGH] I don't know  -- [SIGH] I go through phases where, you know, I'll exercise a lot, and then -- lately I've been in one where I'm just kind of lazy and I don't do anything.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, yeah, I would like to change that, [NOISE] I think, [NOISE] ah, with a -- [SIGH] I -- I try --
L:  Like --
R:  Pardon?  [NOISE]
L:  When you do ... exercises do you, like, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- go to a gym or do --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you just ...?  [NOISE]
R:  Ah, I l- love to run.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.
R:  A- a- and I used to dance, [NOISE] so that used to be my exercise but [SIGH] [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I can't afford classes anymore, so I don't --
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  -- take dance classes.  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  Um, but I -- yeah, I take yoga still, --
L:  Oh, --
R:  -- actually.  [NOISE]
L:  -- that's cool, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that's exercise.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I guess s- so.  [NOISE]
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH]  What do you do when you exercise?  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  Um, usually it's just, like, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- sit ups and stuff.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But I used to, um, [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I was a member of a ... gym --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for a while and [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
L:  -- I liked --
R:  [COUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  -- switches, like, machines --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and stuff.
R:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
L:  I'm really not a fan of running ... at a- [LAUGH] all.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really?  See, a lot of people a- a- aren't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I -- I kind of got myself [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- into it by force and --
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [SIGH] then I've just -- [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] it's been like habit, you know?  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, I've thought --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- starting --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a- and I'd probably like it if I started --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but [SIGH] it's just so hard.  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Where do you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- where do you live?  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  Um, [SIGH] Wisconsin.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  Oh -- oh, really?  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Do you go t- to ... school there?  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  No, I -- I just work, actually.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, okay.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Ah, my friend lives in Ma- --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Madison.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  She goes to the University of Wisconsin.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Really?  I live in Milwaukee.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, I mean, like, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- living in New York City it's hard, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, like, I hate running outside, you know, --
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  -- 'cause of all the smog and it's disgusting --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but [SIGH] I used to work at a summer camp [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in northern Ontario [SIGH] [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- where it's l- like in the middle of nowhere and it's a- all, [NOISE] you know, mountains and lakes [NOISE] and beautiful trees and stuff.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  And I used to take, like, [NOISE] paths in the woods and stuff and just run, [NOISE] a- and run for hours.  [NOISE]  Now, that -- that's the [NOISE] kind of exercise I like, you know?
L:  Yeah, being outside --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that's a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it makes a lot more fun.
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  [SIGH]  It -- it's kind of a nuisance here [NOISE] with all the people a- and the ... p- [LAUGH] pollution I guess.
L:  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  But ... y- yeah.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Y- yeah.  Well, now that it's summer I like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- swimming's fun too.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, do you swim?  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, I do.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Like, my mom's got a pool so I'll --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- go out there sometimes.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  Oh, really?
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Oh, that's cool.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  Um, yeah, I used to [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- swim but [LAUGH] [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] I don't.  I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I guess I'm just k- [LAUGH] kind of lazy.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I'm in my twenties.  You know what?
L:  Yeah, exactly.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]  Who wants to go exercise [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- when you can drink with your friends or s- something, --
L:  [NOISE]  Exactly.
R:  -- y- [LAUGH] you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]  Are they going to record this?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't k- [LAUGH] know.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Y- yeah, I -- I think so.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Well, I guess i- it's the ... truth.
L:  Yes.  [NOISE]
R:  Take the survey off that, you know.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Definitely the truth.  [SIGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Definitely.  I -- I think time constraint is a ... big factor actually in exercise [SIGH] with --
L:  I know, w- working full time and I'm just, like, --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- I get off of work and I just w- w- want to [NOISE] --
R:  What do you do for a living?  [NOISE]
L:  Um, I work in a doctor's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- office, actually, like --
R:  Oh, cool.  [NOISE]
L:  -- [NOISE] with records and stuff.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, see like I'm still a student.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, I go --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to class all day and [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I also have a j- job [NOISE] and, --
L:  Yeah, huh.  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, between, like, when I'm going to do my work or when I'm gonna just r- relax, it's like, who wants to go and e- [LAUGH] exercise, [SIGH] you know?
L:  Yeah, like when you have free time you ... just d- don't really --
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  -- want to spend it working more.  [LAUGH]
R:  It's definitely like [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like, when I go through my phases of exercising I'll go through, like, a month or two --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or two, like, running every day, you know, doing stuff every day.  [SIGH]  It's very structured for me.
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  And then, like, [NOISE] now it's summer time --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I work everyday and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but it's not so much of a schedule --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- any more.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
R:  So, it's kind of like, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, it's not four o'clock -- I can't just go to the gym or someone- [NOISE] -- you know what I mean?  [NOISE]
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Ah, kind of like that, I guess.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  But, ah, ... I don't know [SIGH] what else is there to t- [LAUGH] talk about?  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  I don't know.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  What were the other questions?  Do you want to change your habit?  Do you want to change your habits?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Y- yeah, I do actually.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I would love to get in better shape and --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- love to start, like, a normal ...
R:  Is there anything that, ah, you've never tried that you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- would like to?  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  Um, [LIPSMACK] I -- I want to start running --
R:  [NOISE]  Mm, --
L:  -- but, [LAUGH] I don't --
R:  -- yeah.
L:  -- think I could.  I don't think I'd like it that much.  [NOISE]
R:  Have you ever done, like, a spinning class or a kick +box -- boxing class or anything like that?
L:  [NOISE]  No, I -- I'd be into those too but, like, that costs money --
R:  [NOISE]  Mm, --
L:  -- so, you know.  [NOISE]
R:  -- it does.  [SIGH]
L:  I know.  [NOISE]
R:  But I -- I tried a [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- kick boxing [NOISE] class before and they're s- so much fun.  [SIGH]  It's --
L:  [SIGH]  It was?
R:  -- they're so much f- fun.  [NOISE]
L:  Are they?  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, and --
L:  Is it a lot of work, o- or ...?
R:  [NOISE]  It's w- work [NOISE] that you don't realize you're doing, though.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
R:  'Cause it's kind of like, I mean the -- the classes I've taken [SIGH] have been with a really ... g- great instructor [NOISE] so it's just [NOISE] kind of like, [NOISE] [SIGH] y- you know, you're just having fun, like, whatever kicking ass and then [LAUGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [SIGH] it -- by the time it's over you're, like, sweating and ... you get a good work out.  [NOISE]  So, ...  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Yeah, that's awesome.
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, so [LAUGH] [SIGH] --
L:  So, ...
R:  -- a- ah, that's about it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Something new.  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  What?  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  T- that's s- something new, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I should try that, maybe.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, kick boxing or yoga.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I know yoga's kind of like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- peaceful and relaxing [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [SIGH] I guess.  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  Um, and then there's Pilates too that I've done.  [NOISE]  [MN]  I guess I e- exercise a lot.
L:  Yeah, it sounds --
R:  [LAUGH]  I don't know what I'm saying.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- like you ... exercise a lot --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- more --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- than I ever would.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  I mean I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I've tried many things but it's --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- hard keeping myself on a schedule.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, it's --
R:  Mm.  [NOISE]
L:  -- hard.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I -- I definitely don't do that, but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I, um, ... I did Tae Kwan Do this year.  That was kind of interesting.  [NOISE]
L:  Okay, what e- else have you done?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  I guess I've --
L:  Just as a thought[?].
R:  -- done, a little bit of every --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that -- that's all I've done.
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, okay.
R:  I danced, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I've danced all my life [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
R:  -- but then when I got to college I [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't major in it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and [NOISE] ... classes are very, very expensive for dance so ...
L:  [NOISE]  Are they?
R:  And then, like, you know being in New York City [NOISE] I've just kind of w- wanted to try everything 'cause --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm not from here.  [SIGH]  S- s- so, I've tried a bunch of different classes and our gyms -- our school gym is, um, free [NOISE] and classes are, like, ... twenty dollars for a semester.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  [LIPSMACK]  So, that's why I've just done [LAUGH] everything there.  Like --
L:  Yeah, that's not bad.  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  No, but it's like, [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- once, twice a week for twenty dollars a semester.  It's pretty good.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.  What kind of d- dancing did you do?
R:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Um, I ... started out in ballet and I was really big in ba- ballet.  [NOISE]  I, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [NOISE] I lived in Pittsburgh.  I was part of the P- Pittsburgh Youth Ballet [NOISE] and that kind of stuff.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  And then as I got older I did jazz.  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, neat.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, it was fun.  And I used to perform and act in things.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, like, that was all k- kind of incorporated into [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]  Y- yeah.
R:  -- into that.
L:  It sounds like fun.
R:  Yeah, it was.  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  Were you ever part of a team [NOISE] or anything?
L:  [SIGH]  Um, I p- played basketball.  I was, um, --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- in a team, like, when I was in sixth grade.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  But, yeah, I wasn't really --
R:  Are you tall?
L:  -- enough.  [NOISE]  What?  [NOISE]
R:  Are you tall?
L:  Yeah, I'm kind of tall.
R:  Right.
L:  I was always tall when I was younger.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  Now, I'm kind of [NOISE] --
R:  But you didn't ... k- keep up --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- with it, you know, feel like it?
L:  [NOISE]  No.  [SIGH]  Lately, um, -- actually right[?] when it started to get nice out again, ... my friends and I started to play [SIGH] at night but --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- [SIGH] now that it's s- super hot out again, [NOISE] we've kind of stopped.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  Back to being lazy.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yep, exactly.  [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Um, --
L:  But I do want to change that.  [SIGH]  Hopefully [SIGH] ah --
R:  [COUGH]  The thing is gyms are so expensive, ... you know?
L:  I know, they really are.  It's like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- way too much.
R:  Right, and you can't trust yourself to ... use it ... all the time, like --
L:  That's what happened when [SIGH] I was paying before I ended up going, like, once a week and it just ended up being pointless t- to pay [NOISE] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so much.
R:  'Cause it's just, like, what I'm doing here I could just do outside or something.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  [SIGH]  That's why I -- I never want to pay for it.  I mean we have a s- -- free school gym now which is nice.  But, um, --
L:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
R:  -- I never want to pay for, like, a gym with everything 'cause --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] I'm always, like, well, you know, I plan on going a couple of times a week [LAUGH] but I never [LAUGH] [NOISE] follow through and ...  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  So, it's just ... [SIGH] I don't know.  [NOISE]
L:  E- either have to be totally dedicated or just --
R:  Or --
L:  -- I don't know.
R:  -- like n- [LAUGH] not at a- all.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, e- exactly.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Just give up and live your life I guess.  [NOISE]
L:  Mm.  [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK]  So, ... [SIGH] so has it been ten minutes y- [LAUGH] yet.  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know.  [LAUGH]  Let me check my phone.  [NOISE]  Almost.  Almost.
R:  Oh, okay.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, back to, um, -- how about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- eating right?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Do you eat right?  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  O- oh, no.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  N- no.
L:  I'm a big fan of junk food.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, is that right.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
R:  What's your favorite?  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Um, my favorite j- [LAUGH] junk f- f- food?  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Ah, I don't know.  Come on?  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, --
R:  [SIGH]  Help me out here.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  I like Doritos.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Definitely like Doritos.
R:  Yeah, --
L:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that's good.  [SIGH]  Um, --
L:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [LAUGH] [SIGH] Doritos are g- [LAUGH] good.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Now, how about you, do you -- do you eat bad too?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  U- um, yeah, sometimes, you know, e- everyone has their binges ... but [SIGH] [NOISE] [MN] I used to be a vegetarian and then I stopped that because I wasn't getting enough protein.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  So, ... I used to be ... health conscious.  I'm not as much any more now that I h- have to [NOISE] [SIGH] fend for m- [LAUGH] myself.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess it was more my parents ... up keeping, l- like, to make me eat h- [LAUGH] healthy.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]  But --
L:  That's ... how it works usually.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Actually my mom --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- well this isn't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the w- whole subject, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or is it?
R:  W- whatever.
L:  I guess it would be.  [SIGH]  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Whatever, at this p- [LAUGH] point.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  No, I don't know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- actually, my mom raised me on --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- sweets more than, like, [NOISE] -- I don't know.  It's kind of funny.
R:  She raised you on s- sweets?  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, she ... like --
R:  Like, from the b- [LAUGH] bottle?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  N- n- no.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No she just put -- she spiked my milk with sugar.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]  She was like, "Hey, take these cakes[?]".  [LAUGH]
L:  She was always cooking cakes and stuff --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and --
R:  Oh, really?  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  But it -- like, it didn't affect you at all?
L:  [NOISE]  No, I mean, like, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I think, um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] it never made me h- hate it --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- but it never made me, like, like it more than anyone else, I guess, I don't know.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  I just --
L:  I don't know.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R: -- I -- I'm very -- I have s- Sensitive teeth too so I can only have certain foods, --
L:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] so sugars are b- [LAUGH] bad for me.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  But --
L:  That's -- that's probably a good thing.
R:  -- I --
L:  Well, I mean the s- sensitive teeth isn't g- [LAUGH] good, but [LAUGH] [NOISE] --
R:  No, I know but it, like, stops me --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I also have, like, a bad stomach, --
