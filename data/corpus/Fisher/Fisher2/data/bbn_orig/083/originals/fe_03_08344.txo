R:  Hello.
L:  M- hello, this is Mary Kennedy.
R:  Hi, my name is Dee.
L:  Hello, Dee.
R:  [LAUGH] Um, let's see, health and fitness.  I think it is important and I try to dance.  I dance and I try to dance often but, uh, I'm not very consistent with it.  Like, I'll have times -- you know, periods in my life where I'm, like, "Okay, I'm really fitness" and then -- and then I won't and then a couple of months later, "I'm really fitness" and then I won't, you know.
L:  Well, I'm kinda in the same boat. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  My son plays in a band --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and they played a lot of fifties and sixties and I'd -- my husband and I, and he's now deceased, but we'd always go dancing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And you were -- I mean, this is really a work up --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- and, uh, he -- a lot of the young kids on the floor used to say, "Boy, I wish my parents were like you guys" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] -- and I just looked at 'em and I says, "I call this therapy".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's good, yeah.  It's good for you, it's fun and that's why I like dancing 'cause it's fun and, you know, you don't think about it at the time but later on if you look back you're like, "Wow, I really was, you know, getting a good workout.  It's good for my bones and my muscles and just everything" so ...
L:  Oh, you really get your heart rate up.
R:  So, yeah, in fact I just went dancing last night, it was fun [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  So -- oh, that's --
L:  But other than that I'm not, uh, very good at keeping up with exercise.  I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- have a bike and I sometimes do climb on it but I should be out walking.
R:  Yeah, yeah, I was -- I was thinking about that -- trying to do that today too but right now -- I'm out here in California, right now it's just way too hot -- [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh right.
R:  -- you know
L:  But here it's way too rainy.
R:  Oh really?  Where you at?
L:  I'm in Pennsylvania where we're getting all that rain.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  Every day, every day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, really some hard rains and our lawns are just like a wet sponge when you walk on 'em.
R:  Oh wow.  Wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We could use a little bit of that.  It's way too hot.  It's like I don't -- I don't wanna move, I just wanna stay in the house or just stay in bed and just not move at all 'cause if I move I'll pop. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  But, yeah.
L:  Do you like living in California?
R:  I do actually.  I lived out here, uh, maybe thirteen years now.
L:  Yeah, where'd you move from?
R:  Uh, actually my parents -- my dad was in the military and [NOISE] with my dad's job and everything we moved around a lot so --
L:  Oh yes.
R:  -- I've been to all over.  I've been, uh, South Carolina.  I think I may have drove through Pennsylvania. [LAUGH] I've lived in Texas, I've lived overseas, a lot of different places.
L:  Yeah, you've had a nice life then.
R:  Yeah, I liked it. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.
R:  So, and traveling -- 
L:  My husband used --
R:  -- traveling is good.
L:  Yeah, my husband used to say, "You'd have been a good military wife because I like to travel".
R:  Yeah, it's a lot of fun.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] And that's good for ya, keeps you moving too so that's health and fitness right there.
L:  Yes, and I'd had an -- a heart attack and I, um, [LIPSMACK] was -- went -- went through the physical rehab --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- at the hospital, you know, and I felt like a million bucks when I got done.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, it's -- try -- try to keep up with it, same type of thing, it's good for you.
L:  Yes, it really is and you do feel a lot better.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, probably helps with weight and stuff -- I don't -- I've never really had a weight problem.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm.
R:  Yeah.  My, uh, husband he doesn't do too much movement.  He used to run but, uh, now he doesn't do it as much anymore and his muscles are really, really tight.  You know, I'm always telling him, I'm like, "You should just stretch.  Do something that stretches --"
L:  Yes.
R:  "-- your body and it just -- it makes a very big difference" you know.
L:  Yes.
R:  So ...
L:  When I do go out walking though, uh, it -- it feel good.  I mean, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] tire me out or something like that from being too -- too sedentary, you know.
R:  Yeah.  I read an article that said, uh, people should -- for it to be really healthy you should walk at least ten thousand steps a day.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah, and they did a study between here and overseas and they said people over here usually do maybe three thousand or five thousand steps.
L:  Yeah.
R:  When you go overseas, you know, it -- all the European cities where everybody's walking they do like --
L:  Oh yes.
R:  -- ten thousand, twenty thousand steps a day.
L:  They think nothing of -- of walking several blocks to get som- get a coke or something.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And here if they can't re- if they can't have someone ride them --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- take them --
R:  If they can't park right in front of the store then -- [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yes.  Yes.
R:  Yeah, no one wants to walk from the end of the parking lot.
L:  Yeah, it's pretty bad in this country in that way.
R:  Yeah, you get used to --
L:  And I'll tell you what, you look around, when I was growing up there was no fat kids.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I look now and I thought, "Oh my goodness" and we have heart disease like we have --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and these kids are -- there is going to be so much health -- so many health problems coming up.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's not good.
L:  And, uh --
R:  We should definitely do something about it.  Especially with kids.  You know, kids are supposed be out running and doing something, you know, keeping busy and moving all the time.
L:  You know, one of the things though, the parents are afraid.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We have so many -- I don't know whether it's drugs or what's causing a lot of it, well I think society +period -- period.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, there's just so much on television and I know someone tried to pick my own daughter up and my other daughter did get picked up, another one --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then she got free and I -- and I think this is part of it.
R:  Wow.
L:  People are afraid to let their kids free to run and play and --
R:  Yeah, to be outside.
L:  -- walk.
R:  They just wanna keep 'em inside.
L:  And -- and it's -- it's terrible to think we've come to this.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I had gone over to Germany and Switzerland --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and Austria [LIPSMACK], uh, we were over in Ireland and, uh, England and Wales and --
R:  Oh, nice.
L:  -- and Scotland there but I never was afraid.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they had things that I -- and I remember in Bern, Switzerland, they had these columns with these very, very expensive antique, uh, oh just beautiful things --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in these glass, uh, cages and I s- and I looked at 'em and I -- we were walking down there and I said, "My heavens, they'd have these broken and outta here so fast in this country".
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, it -- it -- I guess we just have such a mixture here and -- and it is a big country.  I said over there when they rule it's like ruling a state --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in this country.
R:  Yeah, that's true.  Everything's a lot smaller.
L:  And this country's just so huge that I don't -- I think it's pretty hard.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  Y- you begin to realize that.  Yeah.  So, on the exercise part of it I think I'm pretty bad.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Me too.  Every so often I -- I can do pretty good but then I fall back again and start doing bad again.
L:  Yeah, I'm off again, on again and I realize that I should be doing it every day but put it off and think, "I'll do it tomorrow".
R:  Exactly [LAUGH].  Tomorrow, I'll -- I'll make up for it tomorrow. [LAUGH] I'll do twice as much.
L:  I do mow my lawn though.  I have almost an acre here and I do --
R:  Oh wow.
L:  -- and I like to -- we have a riding mower but I've never rode it.  My son does but I like to mow it by hand.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's probably a very good workout.
L:  And I do do my own gardening.  I have tomatoes in and -- I usually plant tomatoes and beans and cu- cucumber --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- things like that and I spade it by hand.
R:  That's good.
L:  So, I -- I guess -- and then I have a lot of flowers too but, I guess, I do -- do maybe more than I think I do.
R:  Yeah, all those little things do add up.
L:  Yes.
R:  You know, even just walking from inside your house outside to do those things, you know, that counts.
L:  Yes.
R:  So, it definitely adds up.
L:  Yeah, I guess I do, uh -- I guess because I'm not intentionally doing exercise I feel maybe I'm not doing what I should be doing but I -- when I think of what I do do --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I guess I do more than I thought.
R:  Yeah, and if you have an acre you're probably getting a lot of steps in. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, because that little lawnmower [LAUGH] isn't that wide and you have to take a lot of swipes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, and it's --
R:  That's cool.  That's nice to have that much land.
L:  Yeah, but I wouldn't want anymore.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Unless I was out some -- out further 'cause I'm in the suburbs.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And if I were out further in the country, I mean, I could have my yard but you wouldn't have to worry about all the land around you being mowed.
R:  Yeah, it takes a lot of work.
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah, that's --
L:  So ...
R:  Mm. [LAUGH] I used to have sit down job in a -- [NOISE]
L:  Oh, I did too and, you know what -- you know, I did waitress work and I felt great the whole time --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I mean you run your butt off but then I went to work in the hospital and I had a sitting job and it was very hard for my --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- metabolism to slow down to that type of, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- where I was sitting 'cause I had never been anybody that sat around all my life.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, that was very hard.  And I sometimes wish I'd have never taken the hospital job but there's no pension plan with a waitress job.
R:  Yeah, that's true.  That's true.
L:  Which I had to look at also.
R:  Yeah, I had a -- uh, I worked in a reservation office --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- for a cruise company so we just had to sit down and we were on the phones all day.  And at first it was really nice because before that I worked in a store and I had to, you know, stay on my feet all day and I just -- I wanted to sit down.  But then after I got that job where I was sitting down so much I hated it because, I mean, just -- you know, you just sit down for eight hours a day and just talk on the phone to people.  It was -- it was really --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- bad.
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah, and we got two breaks and one lunch.  The lunch was an hour and the breaks were ten minutes.
L:  That's kind what I had -- was into.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  It -- it's not fun after a while [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, the -- it, uh -- it really bothered me, uh, to have to sit that long --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because I had never ...
