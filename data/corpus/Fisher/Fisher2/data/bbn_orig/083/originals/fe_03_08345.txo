L:  Hi, my name is Dawn.
R:  Hi, Dawn, my name is CJ and I'm over in California.
L:  Oh, what is this, I just talked to a guy yesterday in California.
R:  Oh, where are you at?
L:  Bottom of Maryland.
R:  Oh, well that's kind of good we're in di- different parts of the world.
L:  Yeah, but you ought to be really into fitness over there.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Nice sunny weather.
R:  You -- you would --
L:  Beaches.
R:  -- you would think so but [LAUGH] that's not the necessarily the case.  I think I'm going on the side of need to start up a fitness program.
L:  I don't know about that though.  I think everybody's fitness is different.  You know, what works for some don't work for all, you know.
R:  Y- yeah, I used to be, um, [LIPSMACK] more into that, my mother ended up having a stroke --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- uh, last year and so I kind of -- everything I was doing, which sounded real Californian, I mean, I was doing the yoga and I was doing the wall climbing and I was doing the weight training and all that stuff kinda went by the wayside.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And without that fitness came weight gain which isn't good and when you gain the weight then you don't wanna work out as much.
L:  You gotta be careful and weightlifting though, 'cause that can cause you more problems.
R:  Yeah, yeah, I mean, I -- I was in a -- a setting where people could watch, you know, what I was doing.  They had, um, someone that would oversee --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what you were doing so that was good.  But, I mean, e- it -- it's different -- like you said, uh, the thought is that in California everybody's, you know, fit and they're hanging at the beaches and tanned and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- all that and that's not necessarily the case.
L:  I don't know, I just -- I see all them pictures! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I see all those pictures too.  I see 'em on TV, I'm going, "Where do those people live?" [LAUGH]
L:  I look for that body.
R:  Well, what kind of fitness program do you have?
L:  Oh, I --
R:  Or do you have one?
L:  -- don't.  I don't.
R:  Ye- --
L:  I was diagnosed with asthma ten years ago and between medications and -- no, I can't walk, it takes my breath away, can't do situps 'cause I can't breathe --
R:  Oh wow.
L:  I mean, they've just -- I go on steroids, I gain weight.  You know, when my lungs get real bad he puts me on steroids --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so I gain the weight.  Then he yells at me for gaining the weight.  I said, "Well, what about the new pills that are out?" "Nope, can't have them 'cause it counteracts your medication that you're already on".
R:  Oh wow.
L:  So, my -- my biggest work is standing around on my feet and moving, that's about it.
R:  Um, I need to get where I get off my patootie from in front of the computer and -- and get myself moving.  I have three dogs and I should be walking 'em every day instead of just throwing the ball, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, but it's so much easier to throw the ball.
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] I know.
L:  You know, and I tell you with -- with the lifestyle that everybody leads now how do you fit it in?
R:  [MN] I don't know, when I was, um, working out pretty regular --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean, I'd get up at about five in the morning and I'd head to the pool and was in the pool from five thirty to, like, seven and doing the aquatic fitness stuff and with the float, um, [LIPSMACK] oh, it -- it -- float belt and the little --
L:  Oh god, that sounds like --
R:  -- webcam things --
L:  -- fun.
R:  -- and it -- which was really good because it took the pressure of my back.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you didn't really hurt but people are like, "You get up three days a week at five o'clock in the morning and go work out?" and I'm like, "Yeah" but it -- it worked in the schedule in the job I had at that time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then they switched me too where I was having to go in earlier and I -- it was just getting tougher to -- to get out of the pool, get showered, shampooed --
L:  And get to work.
R:  -- and shined and -- and off to work.
L:  Hey, it's really hard.  I mean, I get up at five o'clock with my husband, get him off, then my daughter's up at six, get her ready for school, then I'm ro- I'm out the door at quarter of seven, you know, I'm at work by seven thirty.
R:  Yeah, and then at the end of the day you're too tired.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Which is why I had to it first thing in the morning 'cause I knew, uh, if I'd come home at four o'clock I'd be like, "I -- I don't wanna go". [LAUGH] I mean, I know I need to but I don't wanna go.  So, for me if I can't do it early then I probably won't do it and if I do it early then I feel more energetic through the day and that's what allowed me to do, like, the wall climbing at night, was because I had the energy from exercising in the morning.
L:  Now, that sounds really neat.
R:  Yeah, that was a -- a cool class.  I was, like, the big girl in the class.  But, uh [LAUGH] --
L:  No, I'm serious, that's sounds, like, really cool.  Now, did you -- did you have the, uh, the wire on you so you couldn't fall?
R:  Yep, yep, you were belayed, you had on the whole harness and everything and you'd -- the walls -- they had eleven different, um, walls that you could climb.  They went up to twenty five feet tall.
L:  You know, they don't --
R:  And I'm afraid --
L:  -- have that here.
R:  Mm?
L:  They -- I don't have it here.
R:  Oh, they don't have any wall climbing gyms --
L:  No!
R:  -- or rock climbing gyms?
L:  No!
R:  Oh, it's kind of a -- 
L:  'Cause I think that would -- would make people -- I mean, something fun.  I mean, they have the aerobics here and, um, yoga, your, uh, gyms, where -- or your holiday spas, you know, where you go --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- work out with the equipment and all.  They got racquet ball but I've never seen the wall climbing here.
R:  Oh, it's -- they have one, uh, oh, entire gym with these wild walls going up and do the ones where you have to half slip to get over the top at this one site that's about twenty minutes from here and they have people that -- you buy, like, a membership.
L:  Now, see --
R:  And you can go when you want and you -- you have someone belay you, which is the person that holds the rope --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and you just climb.  They have the beginner walls, intermediate, advanced.
L:  See, I think if they offered more maybe people would -- would get into the different things.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, and -- and I think, like you said, it depends on where you're at.  I mean, um, it -- it -- we used to have an ice skating place here but that went belly up and now the closest place to go ice skating is fifty miles away.
L:  I think we've got two here.
R:  Yeah, see now in the east coast, because I've been over there, there seems to be a lot more ice skating rinks and roller skating rinks and kind of group little things that you can do and in California it's not so group oriented, I guess --
L:  I don't know, but it just seems --
R:  -- in -- in that respect.
L:  -- like here everybody is so busy though.  You know, bustling, moving, here there and everywhere and -- and a lot of even my girlfriends don't do the exercise.  I mean, the eating healthy we all try to do that --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but as far as getting in there and exercising it just seems like there's just not enough time and, like you said, once you're done with your day of work --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, uh, ones that kids -- I mean, I've gotta come home, I've gotta fix dinner, I've gotta check homework, y- you know, and then I'm lucky to have an hour's worth of television before, oops, gotta go to bed 'cause, you know, we're gonna start all over again in a couple of hours.
R:  Yeah --
L:  I mean, I --
R:  -- my hard part is, you know, like those exercise videos?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I love those things.  I mean, I must have forty of 'em but getting them in the VCR [LAUGH] --
L:  You know what you oughta try a- and it's terrible 'cause mine's sitting here.  I bought the ab roller.
R:  Oh, that sit up machine --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- is that what that is?
L:  And when my -- my meds are on the mark I like doing that.  It's a sit up but it's cushioning your neck and everything and you can do different kinds of exercises with it, I mean, it's a nice piece to have.  I just went to a yard sale and got my cousin one.
R:  [MN]
L:  But, yeah, I like that and I was -- it basically, I think, tightens your abs is what it basically does.
R:  Well, I need all of me tightened 'cause the hard part about me --
L:  So, do I.
R:  -- getting on the floor is with my three dogs, they're not little dogs, they're great big dogs --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- is that if I get on the floor do any of the exercises --
L:  They wanna play.
R:  -- yeah, yeah, they come and they slurp me, you know, so [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when it comes to -- to fitness in the home, uh, it's gotta be one of those ones where I can push a ch- the, um, sofa out of the way and do like the dance or the exercise --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- to it.  You know, the aerobicy --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- type stuff 'cause then they just kinda look at me like I'm strange but if I'm on the floor they're like, "All right, playtime" --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know [LAUGH] --
L:  Hey, it sounded good to me.
R:  Oh, but --
L:  You know, I ju- I -- my mom had a dog and she used to get on the floor and do back exercise 'cause she hurt her back a while back --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the dog would get in her hair.  It was -- she's a little Pomeranian and she used to dig in my mother's hair.
R:  No, my smallest --
L:  I said, "Get away, get away" [LAUGH]
R:  My smallest dog is eight five pounds so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- if I get on the floor do a sit up or two they're -- they're, like, just checking it out 'cause they don't normally see me on the floor doing anything.
L:  [LAUGH] They wanna know -- they wanna play.
R:  Yeah, and I'm afraid if I do the Tai Bo -- I've got the Tai Bo tapes --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that if I do any of the kicking I -- one of them's gonna come by --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I'm gonna s- you know, smack him with my foot and I really, really don't wanna do that.
L:  No, I can understand that.
R:  Yeah, so what I really need to do, I mean, I saw something yesterday where it was talking about walking and I -- I like to walk, I just need to hook my dogs up and I can't do all three of 'em at once 'cause that's three hundred pounds of dog meat, you know, on the other end of the --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- line.  But take 'em one at a time and -- and just get some -- some of that exercise in and i- if you don't get started with it there's just no way to --
L:  Yeah, that's what I tell --
R:  -- you know, you gotta get that --
L:  -- my daughter.
R:  -- motivation, you gotta get that -- what do they call that, you know, where you like drop in --
L:  I call it energy.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I think of the snowball effect, you know, once you start, you know, you build up a little momentum and kinda -- kinda work on that a little bit.
L:  I was doing good for a while but then e- -- I got what they call immune to my medicine --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Uh-huh.
L:  -- and he's right now still trying to figure out what works and what don't.  But for a while there, I mean, I was doing the ab roller and -- and, you know, I had a routine but then I got a cold, which set me back --
R:  Uh.
L:  -- and then he said, "Oh well, we gotta change the meds".  'Cause see I'm -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'm two hundred ...
