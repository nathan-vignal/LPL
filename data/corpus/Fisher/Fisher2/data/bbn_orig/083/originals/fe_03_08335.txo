R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  I'm Arlene from Pocatello, Idaho.
R:  Hi, Arlene, I'm Adrienne from Maryland Heights, Missouri.
L:  Oh my goodness [LIPSMACK], oh --
R:  How are you doing this day?
L:  I -- uh, I'm good.  I'm good.  Is it hot there or wet?
R:  It's extremely hot.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Extremely hot [NOISE].
L:  Uh-huh, it's supposed to be like, um, close to a hundred in the next few days. [LIPSMACK]
R:  Yeah, that's about [NOISE] what it's supposed to be here too.  It's so -- it's just not moving, it's just [NOISE] steam.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I'm inside.  I stay inside in the air conditioning pretty much.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I can't get any of my children to go out [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] I -- I don't blame them.
R:  [LAUGH] Uh, no.
L:  So, what do you --
R:  The topic is kinda interesting.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  I was just -- I just -- actually, I've started, um, uh, a new exercise program, um, that's really, um, starting to pay off for me as well [NOISE].
L:  What are you doing?
R:  What I'm doing is, um -- I, um -- first of all a lot of people in my neighborhood walk -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- for exercise and, um, I started walking and, um, one of the -- the street -- one of the streets in my neighborhood goes straight up hill [NOISE] --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so I go up hill --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I do that every other day.
L:  All right.
R:  And then the days that I'm not walking I, um, I do aerobics, um, uh, here at home on -- on the health channel --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- Discovery health channel, they have aerobics, um, programs all day long for the most part and I do that and some of them are step aerobics which I used to do a couple of years ago.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, uh, when I'm not doing that -- 'cause I try to do something at least five days a week.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  I, uh, run up and down my stairs in my house [LAUGH].
L:  Uh-huh, that -- yeah, I guess running up and down, even walking up a long --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, flight of stairs is really, really good exercise.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, because it -- the weird thing was that, um, when I did that [NOISE] I noticed that my -- my legs were sore the next day.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  So, that made me think, "Wow, the stairs are really something".  I could barely -- I could barely make it though, it was hard going up the stairs.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, it is -- it is really hard [NOISE].
L:  Yeah, it -- it is.
R:  But worth it.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Um, I try to walk and since it's so hot in the summer I got at --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- six in the morning.
R:  Me too! [NOISE] That's when I go.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  I go as soon as I walk up. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it's usually about six o'clock.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, I found that I'm -- because of the -- the heat it's just -- I couldn't take it at like [NOISE] -- you know, even ten o'clock in the morning it's too hot.
L:  Oh yeah, well and you get real humid --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- down there, don't you?
R:  Oh yeah, it's really --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- really humid.
L:  -- ours is more of a dry heat but it's still, you know --
R:  [NOISE] Oh --
L:  -- it's -- it's --
R:  -- it's bad.
L:  -- it's wearing, wears me out a lot.
R:  [NOISE] It sure is, it sure is.  On the fourth of July [NOISE] it was -- it felt no different when [NOISE] we went outside to the, um, uh, to see the fireworks [NOISE] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it felt no different at night than it did during the, uh, the morning and during the day.  I couldn't believe that it was just so hot there was no -- there was no way I was going out walking. [LAUGH]
L:  No, no.
R:  No way.
L:  I, um, feel for people like mail carriers and, um, people who work on the streets and I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- maybe they get used to it, I don't know --
R:  I know.
L:  -- how long have you lived there?
R:  I've lived here -- I haven't lived here but, um -- just coming up on five years but -- well then my husband's military so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- we've -- we've lived all over.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But he gets to carry mail too and he just used to walk --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, he got really great exercise doing it but, um, it was -- he did it in the summer time and it was really hard on him.
L:  Oh, oh yeah.
R:  Yeah, so it's not something that, um, he wanted to do for too long, let me tell you, that was just a job transition [LAUGH].
L:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
R:  He -- as soon as -- as soon as, uh, he got his job offer that was the end of the --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- walking mail -- mail carrier thing.
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  You know, but --
L:  I -- I often wondered about that.  Well, I feel for the guys in the military who are -- especially when they're first training --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- who have to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- run and, you know [MN] --
R:  Yep, in all types of weather.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  That's just -- I mean --
L:  Yeah, that'd be hard.
R:  -- the physi- the physical fitness part of it is great but, um, it really -- it really chal- challenges you as far as, um, um, you're fitness levels when the heat is so intense like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, or when it's extreme cold, whatever it may be.
L:  Right, right.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I would much rather have the cold though.  I would much rather go out and do something in the cold than in the heat.
R:  I think I would too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think I would too.
L:  Like, because I have more energy and, I don't know, I ju- I just feel better, yeah.
R:  I agree I think the -- I think the heat just zaps you of energy.
L:  Mhm, it does.
R:  But you know [LAUGH] when it's cold you wanna keep moving.
L:  [LAUGH] That's true.
R:  You know [LAUGH], you know, you don't wanna stop moving for anything --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, you wanna keep moving.  By -- by -- by --
L:  No.
R:  -- chance are you an RMCer?  Have you ever heard of RMCer?
L:  No.
R:  Refunding makes cents.
L:  No.
R:  No, okay, I was just making sure because a lot of, um, people that, um, subscribe to, um, refunding makes cents often do the Fisher, um, phone call surveys.
L:  Oh, no I never heard --
R:  -- so I figured --
L:  -- of this before.  A friend of mine who's on the internet all the time --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- told me about it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I've talked to more people all over the country and it's wonderful [LIPSMACK].
R:  Oh, I know, but you know what, the thing is I talk to a lot of people but I missed like -- I missed two calls and I couldn't -- there was nobody for me, they couldn't get anybody on the other end.
L:  Oh, that's --
R:  So, this is like my third or -- I think it's a total of five tries, I think.
L:  Oh my goodness, I've been really, really lucky, this is my sixth and every time they've connected me --
R:  Oh really?
L:  -- right away.  Yeah. [LIPSMACK]
R:  How long does it go on?
L:  You know, I don't know.  They said three but I've had -- this is the sixth one, so I don't know.
R:  This is your sixth one -- wow, you're lucky --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you really are lucky and you've --
L:  I know.
R:  -- managed to talk to a lot of people.
L:  Yeah, I have, it's been great.  Oh --
R:  Oh good.
L:  -- I was going to ask you, do you lift weights at all?
R:  I, um, I used to lift weights a lot and it's absolutely fabulous --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- for toning but what I do --
L:  Did you got to a gym or did you just have a --
R:  Yeah, I used to go to a gym, but now -- I don't care to go to a gym now but, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, um, as far as weight as training, um, I don't do that yet but I intend to start doing that again because I really, really --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- loved it.
L:  I just have the little hand weights.  I just --
R:  That's all I have now too, yeah.
L:  -- I'm  -- yeah, I only have five pounds and I'm gonna --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'm gonna try to get, um, heavier ones but, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think it builds my metabolism.
R:  You know what I found out and this -- this amazing, it's so interesting that this is the topic of conversation, but have you -- are you familiar with the, um, [NOISE] Carbohydrate Addict's Diet?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay, that's what I started doing about two weeks ago and it really does work.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Because I'm so overweight, I'm so overweight, so, uh, far beyond my, um -- my, uh, optimal weight --
L:  I'm, like, forty, fifty pounds overweight, yes.
R:  Yeah, that's about what I am too --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, I, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- realize that it's the most amazing thing 'cause I don't -- I don't do diets and never have but --
L:  No, it's --
R:  -- I really, really want to lose weight and this one works.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  It's amazing, it, um -- you -- you basically have what they call two complimentary meals that you can eat every day.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that's a list of food, you know, that, um, that you stick to for, like, breakfast and lunch.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then the dinner meal you could eat pretty much whatever you want, which sounds absolutely crazy --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- but for some amazing reason it works because the diet [NOISE] actually changes your metabolism and your insulin levels in your body.
L:  Oh my goodness.
R:  And be- because of what you eat and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the time of day that you eat it, it actually works and I can't believe that more people don't know this.
L:  Now, did you get a book?
R:  I [MN] -- I -- but believe it or not I got the book probably two years ago and never read it.
L:  And it's just called Carbohydrate Addict --
R:  It's called Ca- the, um, the Carbohydrate Addict's Diet --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and it's basically -- you know, you know, the carbohydrates, the pasta, the bread and the potatoes --
L:  Right, yeah, yeah.
R:  -- but the shocking thing is even the foods that we think are good foods, like the fruits and the vegetables, those have, um, amounts -- uh, certain amounts of carbohydrates in them.  But --
L:  Yeah, I knew they did.
R:  -- but the interesting thing is you can still eat them --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but you just don't eat them, um, for breakfast, uh, and lunch and you can eat whatever you want at dinnertime.
L:  Oh.
R:  'Cause I used to go walking and I would take an apple with me while I was walking --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- and then I realized that that's basically, um, uh, it's, um -- it's -- it's -- it's a large amount of carbohydrates --
L:  Right.
R:  -- even in one apple and --
L:  And they turn to sugar too, right.
R:  Right, and it just turns to sugar --
L:  Yep, mhm.
R:  -- and, um, so what you do is you don't eat those foods -- any kind of foods that have carbohydrates in 'em unless it's a very trace amount and you have a list of foods that you can eat and, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what it does is it actually decreases your hunger and it absolutely works.
L:  Oh my goodness.
R:  I -- I was shocked, I couldn't believe it that there was -- 'cause you know how you get so hungry, you're just starving --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] after a while -- after you've been on it three or four days your hunger just begins to decrease --
L:  Oh, I'm gonna get it.
R:  -- naturally.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I'm not talking with pills, there's no pills, there's no drugs --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- it just decreases.
L:  All right. [LIPSMACK]
R:  And, um, it's the most amazing thing and -- and, uh, you slowly begin to lose weight --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- because it changes your metabolism, you just lose weight and lose weight and lose weight and lose weight.
L:  I will have to try it because I just, oh --
R:  Look up -- look it up it's on -- look up on the internet, um, it's two doctors, it's a husband and wife that are doctors and their last name's Heller, H.E.L.L.E.R.
L:  Okay.
R:  And it's called The Carbohydrate Addict's Diet and --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- y- you can get the book and it's -- it absolutely works.
L:  Wow, wow.
R:  I  mean -- I mean, I -- and I don't believe in dieting.
L:  No, I don't either.  No, I [MN] believe in changing your habits and --
R:  Changing your lifestyle --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and your habits.
L:  Right.
R:  I know when I was exercising I used to even do, um -- I was even, like, into --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- aerobics a lot and I even became a -- like, a -- a -- an aerobics instructor --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- where the -- our aerobics teacher trained a class --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and then we got certified.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I never lost any weight.
L:  Oh my goodness [LIPSMACK].
R:  Oh -- not one pound because I -- um, I -- I didn't change my eating habits, but I --
L:  Right.
R:  -- firm- firmed up and toned --
L:  Right, uh-huh.
R:  -- fantastically --
L:  Yeah, oh I imagine.
R:  -- because of the aerobic --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  But as far as the eating habits, you -- I never lost any weight because you're building muscle when you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- do aerobics and so muscle weighs more than fat and you just start -- and you never lose weight but you just get the toned feeling --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and the look, but, um --
L:  Mm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] This one actually does work and you will drop weight.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Okay, I will go for it.  That's --
R:  Let me tell you real quick before we go what I, um -- what you can eat.
L:  Okay.
R:  And I'll -- I'll make I real quick 'cause I don't wanna hog the conversation --
L:  [LAUGH] That's okay, that's okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I've learned a lot.
