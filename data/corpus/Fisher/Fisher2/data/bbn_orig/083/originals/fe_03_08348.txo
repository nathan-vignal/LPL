R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't know.  Like, that's pretty bad though.  I don't think it's that humid in, yeah, in New York is it?

L:  [LAUGH] You don't use it though?
R:  No.
L:  Yeah, like, uh, [NOISE] [several inaudible words] that though, we're -- we're not even gonna use it, so, there's no point in having any of the machines.  I think my --

R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for it?  Like, yeah, uh, but, uh, I think it's -- she thought it was only like a hundred bucks or something like that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And she ordered it and then when we got it here, there was like a bill for like four hundred bucks [LAUGH], so --
R:  Really?
L:  -- she just like returned that thing.  So, I don't know.  I'm, like, we don't have any training or equipment or anything like that though.  I don't know.
R:  Yeah, well, at school they had like all these weird machines that you could use and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- some of them were kind of fun but like, I just don't see the point, you know.
L:  Yeah, like, whatever happened to like the ab roller crap?  Um, like, they had like a bunch of those coming out, like would be a couple of years ago or a year ago.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Thinking, I don't know.  We bought like -- we had like, I don't know.  Like my friend has, like, um, one of the ab roller things.
R:  Uh-huh.

R:  I don't know.
L:  Where, uh -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- where you get like free training or like where you get to use the gym for free, like for training -- like one, I mean, five in eight, or something like that.  And that -- that thing kind of worth it though but --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- I don't know.
R:  Probably --
L:  Yeah, but --
R:  -- not, like --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  I just can't see myself like dragging myself outside to go somewhere to exercise, you know.

R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Um, do you guys -- do you play basketball or anything, or not?
R:  No, not really but I did in gym, like for a while but ...

R:  No.
L:  Oh, so, mm, you don't even go to any like, the Ranger's game or like the -- what -- what do you guys -- what's like closer to you?  Like the Knicks, or the ...?
R:  I've been to like one or two.  I -- like, if friends want to go, you know, I don't have a problem [LAUGH] but --
L:  Yeah [NOISE].  Uh, we got like everything, like the Mavericks and then like everything down here but we haven't been to any of them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, it's like twenty seven bucks just to see like a decent game but I mean like a decent --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- [inaudible], like a decent seat.  Is it expensive down there, or not?
R:  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't know.
L:  Is it -- how much is like the gas and everything?
R:  Uh, [NOISE] not sure [LAUGH].  It --
L:  Right.
R:  -- varies.
