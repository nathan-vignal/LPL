R:  Hi, I'm Patty.
L:  Hi, I'm Barbara.
R:  Hi, Barbara.  I've never done this before, have you?
L:  Um, this is about my third call.
R:  Oh, okay.  Then you can help me out a little.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  How do we do this?
L:  Oh, you just talk in general, I guess, the topic today is health and fitness.
R:  Okay.
L:  Uh, do you work out on a regular basis?
R:  Yeah, I do.
L:  Very --
R:  Actually just, uh, aerobics, weightlifting and that's it.
L:  Well, that sounds good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you take classes or do you do, like, video tapes?
R:  Uh, video tapes at home [NOISE].
L:  Oh, that -- I -- that's the way I do it. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I don't have time to, you know, drive the car to somewhere I -- I -- I guess -- you know, I have enough with being able to just, you know, get downstairs in my basement and do it without having --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- to actually go to a different building.
L:  Yeah, well that's -- that's the way I am.  I'm much more likely to do it if I don't have to make a big effort to get there. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly.  Or, you know, too I'm not one who likes to actually work out in front of people --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- you know [LAUGH].
L:  I'm with you on that one.
R:  I used to, uh, belong to a health club and it was, like, such a meat market I was so uncomfortable and I figured, you know, after I got married I was, like, "Forget it" [NOISE] not doing that anymore [NOISE].
L:  Exactly.  Well, and my experience was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when I would go to the gym I would just use the treadmill so it was really kinda silly [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah [NOISE].  Especially since a treadmill really costs as much as one of those memberships [NOISE].
L:  No kidding, that's why I was like, "Oh, I think I'll just save up my money and get a treadmill and do it at home".
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  But, uh, I also do walking, like --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- Wednesday nights I walk with a friend so --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, that's fun. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, we usually walk about four miles which is just enough to have a good enough impact and we have a great time talking so --
R:  Yeah, that's a nice thing getting out of the house.  I, uh --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- my husband and I try to walk or ride our bikes like once in a great while but whether he gets home on time or blah, blah, blah, you know.
L:  Right, right.
R:  So, that's not something I usually get to do [NOISE] but, let's see, what else?
L:  You like, uh, regular aerobics --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or step aerobics?
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] what it is, uh, it's called Walk away the Pounds.
L:  Oh yeah, with Rosalie Samson or something like that.
R:  Yeah, I don't remember her name.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, it's, uh, it -- with the weights and everything --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, I don't use the -- the ball weights that they tell you to. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I, uh, just use regular weights and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- as I got more used to it I went up from two pounds to five pounds, so ...
L:  Oh, that's great.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm big into health and fitness and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- although I haven't actually gone and taken the test --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- yet I studied to, um, the American Council of Exercise, aerobics instructor like --
R:  Oh wow!
L:  Yeah, so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I know all those.  In fact the videos that I recommend are, and I know this -- this sounds silly but, um, Elle McPherson had one out like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- several years back called Your Personal Back but it's really good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's, um, lead by Karen Voight which is actually a very good -- she's very well know in the fitness industry so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I like that one 'cause it's got circuit --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- training so you do, like, a ten minute session of aerobics and then you do, like, five to ten minutes of, uh, toning, you know, different weights exercises --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  So, it's just a really neat format and it really brought great definition to my arms so --
R:  Oh really?
L:  -- I always tell people about that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I was like, "That's a really great video".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So --
R:  Well, when you can see results I mean that's really the [NOISE] -- the biggest thing, you know.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  'Cause somebody asked me one time how the Walk away the Pounds was and I was like, "Well, it's really great because I can actually see, you know, my -- when I sit down my leg- my thighs don't spread out --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- as much as they usually do".  I'm like, "So, I would recommend it". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But at first I was like, you know, if anybody said, you know, "Oh, how is that?" I'll be like, "I'll let you know". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Exactly.  And I'm really funny with video tapes, like, I've tried other ones but I always tend to go back to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the three that I -- well actually four if you count ones I've taped off the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- TV[?].  But these four that I have and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'm like -- I've tried other ones but I always go back to these four.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, you always stick with what you're used to.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  I tried that Tai Bo and that was, um -- [MN] I don- I don't know how many times I just took -- completely lost balance and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'm not usually such a clumsy person, you know, and I just, like, was like, "Forget that". [NOISE]
L:  It was too hard on my hip --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, hip problems run in my family just like the joints.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It was just really too hard on my hips to maintain it 'cause you're doing so much kicking and leaning over on one side and I was, like, "My hips can't withstand this". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  So --
R:  See, I thought that maybe, 'cause I have knee problems and I thought that it would be bad, you know, so I was like, "Well, I'll just go slow at first" and it totally wasn't even that, it was more rug burn than anything. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh yeah, yeah.
R:  'Cause I just kept falling my side, I'm like, "Dammit".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Try to do a kick and I'm, like, down. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  So, the other thing that I do fitness wise is we have a Bowflex but I haven't used it forever.
R:  Mhm [NOISE].
L:  It -- it's a really great, um, I -- I -- dare I call it a machine --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah
L:  -- or I don't know what to call it but --
R:  My brother has one of those. [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  It's really great, it's just I have a real hard time unless I have somebody to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like, show me how to change it.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  So, I'm -- like I told my husband, he -- he's the one that wanted to get it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, uh, not using it currently but he has used it a lot in the past.
R:  Mhm [NOISE].
L:  Well, like you need to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- say, like for, like, a month full of weekends in a row and show me how to change this.  And after see it several times I might, you know, it might become easy to me but right now it's not easy. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah, I know what you mean, 'cause there's so many different, uh, [NOISE] ways that -- you know, for all the different muscle groups and it's not as easy as just, you know, put your arm this way.  You actually have to put the rope here and [NOISE] --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- and this there.
L:  Not like at the gym where you just go to a different machine, you don't really have to change --
R:  Yeah, exactly.  There's a plus for the gym.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  But I would never do -- like, I would always be in such a hurry that's why I would never use it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I would just go in and get my aerobic exercise so --
R:  Yeah, you know, I -- and the thing about the aerobics, um, that I actually did like was, you know, there's actually somebody there and, you know, they're telling you exactly what to do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And you -- you're motivated to do it because there's like a bunch of other people in the room.
L:  Right [LAUGH].
R:  And if you stopped you're like, [MN] and they'd be like, "Oh, keep going" and it's like, "Dammit".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You don't wanna be embarrassed like that so that's the one thing that I do have to say was good about going to the gym was the aerobics. [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  But the machines and stuff I was always, like, "Nah" because I knew, you know -- and plus if I ever did something, you know, where I needed a spotter or anything I was always like, "I'm not gonna ask some stranger, could you spot me" you know.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Even though, I mean, I'm su- you know, everybody's always like, "Oh, do you need a spotter or anything?" I'm still --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- I'm like, "Oh no, thank you".
L:  I -- I did have a personal trainer for a while and that was really awesome because like it -- it -- it goes back to the Bowflex thing, you gotta have somebody there to show me and tell what to do not --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just kinda like, "Well, I think this machine does this".
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, right, there you go.  That is a good idea. [NOISE] I've never actually signed up for the personal trainer thing though because [NOISE] I never knew if I could keep the commitment schedule.
L:  Right.
R:  Since I'm always doing something different.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, that was one thing I always wanted to try but I never go the chance.  That's always been my -- my problem in the, uh, [NOISE] fitness world is the time constraints.
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Well, and -- and that goes back to the videos, that's a nice thing 'cause --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- I'm not much of a morning person, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- although that's probably the best time for me to do it but, um --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I like that I can do it at midnight --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if I want to. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, exactly.  You know, you  -- you know, gotta go here, gotta there and then you go home, if you've got a half an hour just do it --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- and then you're done and [NOISE] yeah, you don't have to wait for somebody to start the class, finish the class and --
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  -- you know, I definitely like that. [NOISE] I tried -- the other video that I just tried recently was the, um -- it was a really old, um, [LIPSMACK] oh man, I can't remember the woman's name.  But it was, like, so great because it was one of the videos where [LIPSMACK] you know, you get a point where your like, "Oh God, when is it gonna end" and it's like just started up.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, like, when is she gonna stop doing this one exercise and she'd be like done. [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I was like, "Oh my God, she's reading my mind".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I can't remember her name though.  I think it was Lisa something.
L:  Mm.
R:  [NOISE] Uh, I can't remem- --
L:  Well, I'm trying to think --
R:  -- I borrowed it from a girlfriend.
L:  There's Denise Austin --
R:  Denise Austin, that's it.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And I thought -- I thought she was so good.
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  Yeah, [NOISE] I borrowed the tape from a girlfriend and I -- I wrote the name down 'cause I was, like, "I'm definitely gonna look into those". [NOISE]
L:  Oh, I also like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- one of my favorite instructions is Candy Lee Webb.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  I don't usually like her, like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- manufactured tapes.  She has one out right now that --
R:  [NOISE] I was gonna say, isn't she on, like, the ESPN in the morning?
L:  Yes, she is.  That -- that's the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- remember I said the four tapes.  I tape things like that off the show and I love her --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- she's my --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, I always tape her shows --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I have a whole, like, six hour video tape of her little routines that I do.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, that's good.  You know, I never even thought to -- duh, tape [NOISE] -- you know, just tape it off the cable. [NOISE]
L:  I know it's concerned illegal but [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But, I mean --
R:  But it makes total sense, you know. [NOISE] I was always like, "Oh, I should get her tape" or whatever [NOISE].
L:  Yeah, if her professional tapes --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- were the same as her -- you know, what she does on the TV then I'd have no problem but they're not.
R:  Oh, they're not, no?
L:  The -- you know, her professional tapes are just so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- professional, you know, but she's not -- like, she doesn't let her personality out like she does --
R:  [NOISE]
