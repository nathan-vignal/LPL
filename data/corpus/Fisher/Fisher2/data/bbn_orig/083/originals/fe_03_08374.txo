R:  Hi, uh, I'm Corinne.
L:  I'm Bob.
R:  Hey.
L:  Corinne?
R:  Yes, mhm.
L:  Oh, what do you think about health and fitness and exercise?
R:  What's that?
L:  What do you think about health and fitness and exercise?
R:  Well, uh, I don't know, I don't exercise, do you?
L:  You what?
R:  I don't exercise at all.
L:  I don't much either.
R:  No.  I guess that's something that should be done, but I just --
L:  Well, they say you should, you should walk an hour a day or something.
R:  Well, yeah, I guess.  I used to walk but I guess that's -- now I have to drive to work --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so I basically just spend time in my car driving to work and back from work and then that's it and my day is done, so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I guess that's --
L:  Do you walk at work?
R:  Well, walking works, I mean, definitely does -- when I was a student I was actually walking, uh, from my apartment to campus every day for classes and, I mean, I was walking --
L:  I know.
R:  -- a whole lot and --
L:  I know. 
R:  -- I was fitter, I guess, than I am now plus I'm smoking so I definitely should --
L:  Oh, you're smoking?
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, that's bad for you.
R:  Well, I guess so, so she suddenly decides, "Right --" although I don't believe that exercising is going to change anything for me since I'm smoking but, well, I don't know, I don't know.
L:  Well, quit then because you're smoking, right.
R:  What's that?
L:  Just quit everything because you're smoking.
R:  No, no --
L:  No good eating habits, no good exercising --
R:  No, I have -- I have good eating habits, I do.
L:  Oh, do you?
R:  Oh, yeah, way better than a lot of people I know.
L:  Oh.
R:  Definitely, I mean, I don't eat fast food food --
L:  No, like --
R:  -- at all, I --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I mean, I don- -- I think I'm good for that, I think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'm good.  But, um, I don't know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that exercising is just too much, I guess, on my schedule, I don't know.  Are you planing on exercising?
L:  No.
R:  Why?
L:  Well, I would have died if I'd had a lot of exercise recently.
R:  Why's that?
L:  I went into kidney failure about two or three years ago --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and my brother and sister in law were trying to encourage me to run --
R:  Well --
L:  -- three and four or five years ago --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and if I'd been running and exercising the way they said, I would have died of a heart attack.
R:  Oh, right, so you can -- you are actually forbidden any kind of physical exercise?
L:  No, I'm not, I had a kidney transplant from my wife this last year.
R:  Okay.
L:  And now I have a -- a fresh new kidney --
R:  All right.
L:  -- and I -- I can -- I can walk and exercise and swim and -- not strenuous exercise --
R:  Wow, okay.
L:  -- but I don't do it.  I've been thinking of joining a health club and be able to --
R:  Maybe -- maybe that would make it easier if you actually --
L:  Do you belong to a health club?
R:  Yeah, yeah, my husband does --
L:  'Cause --
R:  -- belong to a health club and he actually goes there quite regularly.
L:  Does he run on the treadmill?
R:  He runs mar- -- basically he just runs -- he runs marathons and things of that sort.
L:  Oh, is that right?
R:  Yeah.  So, I guess I -- I have a good model at home and I should try to, uh, model my behavior after his but it just doesn't work.  But -- but he does exercise a whole lot and we actually have -- we're live in an apartment complex that does have some kind of, you know, health fitness center,
L:  Health club -- yeah, health club.
R:  Y- yeah, uh-huh, right there --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in the premises and that comes --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in with the rent and we don't actually have to pay extra.  My husband has yet another subscription to another club outside our apartment complex --
L:  Oh, is that right?
R:  Yeah, but I -- I -- I don't use the facilities either.  I mean, it really boils down to the fact that I really don't have -- I mean -- yeah, I don't have time and it would be really a stretch for me to try --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and make time for it.  That would mean really doing it at night, basically after my whole day's done.  I should --
L:  Do you go to school during the day too?
R:  Uh, yeah, I go to school but I teach at --
L:  Oh, really.
R:  -- school.  So, it means that I go to school and then I come back from school and I do more work at home, so most of the time I'm --
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  -- not done before eleven PM so m- --
L:  Yeah, that's pretty hard to squeeze in exercise unless you did it on the weekend.
R:  Well, yeah, I guess the weekend's -- the weekend is, uh, my best bet, I guess --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- yeah, definitely, definitely.  But, I don't know, I guess --
L:  But they say do it every day, walk an hour every day.
R:  Yeah.  Ju- just that a -- yeah, th- that would definitely be great.  That would definitely --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- be good.  I mean, the thing is that, uh --
L:  If you could jog --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I think walking is better for you than running really. [NOISE]
R:  Well, I guess that walking is the easiest way to exercise and it's --
L:  It's easier to exercise than jog.
R:  Yeah, and I think it's a pretty complete exercise though too, you know, because, I mean, you get -- you get to exercise all parts of your body basically, and I guess --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it is good for your heart and I'm -- I guess that kind of things, I mean, I'm really --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- talking about things that I'm not really familiar with but [NOISE] I don't know, I don't know.  I guess that exercising is, uh -- I guess I -- I -- yeah, it's just something that I've grown out of, I used to do a whole lot when I was younger -- when I was in high school, I guess, but, now --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's over -- now it's over.  I don't know, I don't know.
L:  How many children do you have?
R:  I don't have any children.
L:  Oh, you don't have any children?
R:  No, no, uh-uh, I don't have any --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- no, not yet, not yet.
L:  No.
R:  So, I guess it's not going to get any better --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- schedule wise. [LAUGH] If I ever --
L:  Right.
R:  -- have children it's going to be even more difficult --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I don't know, I don't know.  Do you have children?
L:  No. [NOISE]
R:  Okay.  All right, does your wife exercise, no?
L:  [NOISE] No, she doesn't exercise either.
R:  Okay, all right.
L:  So, I don't -- so we just don't exercise.
R:  Mm.  Maybe, uh -- maybe doing it with somebody else --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- would make it easier although, as I said, my husband exercises and I don't -- I don't tag along, I just have my stuff to do and I just let him go and do his thing and not really --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- think about it any more, so --
L: [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- I guess, I don't know, I don't know.  But, well -- but, well ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, I guess -- I don't know -- i- it's -- it's just terrible to be exercising here too -- I live in the south of the US --
L:  That's hot in the summer.
R:  It -- it's terrible, I mean, right now I'm dripping, it's so hot, it's very hot and very sticky.  So, we're talking about walking and I guess that walking --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is nice outside --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't like walking on the treadmill --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but walking outside right now is just not good, it's really not a good idea, it's so hot, I mean, it's terrible, it really is.  Th- that would be a [LAUGH] -- that would be a good way to, uh, have a heart attack, I guess --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- given that the sun is really blazing pretty hard around here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Sorry?
L:  Yeah, I, um -- it's hot here now too, we live in Cincinnati.  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Yes?
L:  It's hot here too, we're in Cincinnati and it's --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- we've been having a hot spell too.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I -- yeah, I wouldn't have thought that it would get hot up there too, I don't know.  I -- I see some people every now and then around here, like, where I live, running --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- around, like, three PM in the afternoon when it's, like, the hottest in the day --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- and they -- I mean, it doesn't make me want to exercise because they really don't look like they're having a -- a good time at all, so I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean, it really doesn't -- to s- -- you know, you see, like, you know, guys just running around, you know, and -- without a tee shirt and just dripping and they're -- they're really not looking like -- like they're having a good time.  I don't know, maybe in their case it would be better to just do it on the treadmill.  I don't know, it just --
L:  Uh, always I see people on the street running --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and they're crazy, I mean --
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I- it really makes me think, like, you know, it's not good for your health, if really that's the goal, if running is the --
L:  I have a bad left knee besides so I can't really run, I can walk.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  But, um, if I have a -- it's better for me to swim, I guess, at the health club.
R:  Yes, swimming is really good, it's -- I -- I think it's a softer way of exercising, you know, and it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- agreeable too, it is very agreeable.  I guess --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that the summer time is maybe a good time to actually try and do that, it's --
L:  But you can't swim in a public pool really, with all those kids and stuff.
R:  Yeah, well [LAUGH] I guess that's the problem.  Or if you -- you should actually go to pools, like, pretty early in the morning --
L:  Oh, is that right.
R:  -- before the kids, you know, come in, you know, since they're --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- on break right now.  You'll have a little more peace and more -- I guess, space to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, just be, uh, swimming laps --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and that's it so I guess it would be good way of -- of exercising and plus, it's -- I mean, you just need to find a public swimming pool around where you live.  You don't really have to, you know, buy --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a health club subscription or to really invest in a lot of gear so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I guess, I mean, all those would be great things, I guess, to exercise, it's just that it doesn't seem that it's ever going to happen for me, I don't know, I don't know.  I should get back into what I have --
L:  Well, you're still young and when --
R:  Yeah, I guess --
L:  -- you get older -- it's better to exercise than when you're older than when you're young.
R:  Well, if you form some kind of a habit, maybe, when you're young, you know.  It's easier to just --
L:  I don't think so, I think people quit about middle age --
R:  You think?
L:  -- and that's when they need it the most.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know --
L:  I had a -- I have two brothers that, uh -- both their wives exercise a lot -- run -- run a lot.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Now they're getting older they're stopping --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so then that's when they need it is when they're middle aged and older.
R:  Yeah.  I guess that, I mean, it -- it -- it's -- I mean, surely it's the time in your life when you need it the most --
