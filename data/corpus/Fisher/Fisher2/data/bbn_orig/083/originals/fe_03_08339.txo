R:  How you doing?  I'm Josh.
L:  Hi.  I'm Helen.
R:  How you doing, Helen?
L:  Okay.  Uh, uh, well --
R:  So, do you work --
L:  I work -- I --
R:  Do you work out? [LAUGH]
L:  A little I have a treadmill and, uh, I take Tai Chi and occasionally go to the pool.  I have arthritis so --
R:  Wow.  Okay.
L:  I can't, uh, can't do as much as I'd like.  What do you do?
R:  Well, it's good that you're at least exercising.  I actually, uh, work out, uh, four or five times a week.
L:  Oh, very good.
R:  Um, I do weights.  I'm a pretty big guy.  I'm about six one.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, so I -- I do weights every day.  Um, [SIGH] that -- that's how I start my workouts.  I guess every day I do two different body parts and then, uh, after my workout I'll do about, uh, twenty -- twenty to thirty minutes of cardio.  Uh --
L:  Oh, very good.
R:  -- the elliptical machine.  
L:  Very good.
R:  I also jog on the weekends.  Um, [LIPSMACK] but that's pretty much it.  Uh [NOISE] have --
L:  Do you -- do you, um, play any sports or --
R:  Yeah, I actually play football.
L:  Oh, do you?
R:  I used to play football --
L:  Right.
R:  -- when I was younger.  Um, [SIGH] I still try to remain active though, you know.  Um, sometimes we have flag football leagues and stuff like that.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] are you a member of any gyms?
L:  No, I'm afraid not.  Um, I'm retired --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a- and I do volunteer work and, like I say, have arthritis.  So I, uh, I just started the Tai Chi about two weeks ago.  I think that'll be a big help.  I like it a lot.
R:  Yeah, is it -- it's -- do -- do you actually work up a sweat doing, uh --
L:  Yes, you do.
R:  Really?
L:  Surprisingly.  I -- I didn't think so but you [NOISE] do and, uh, [NOISE] then I try to get to the pool occasionally.  Uh, we have a therapy pool here at the local hospital that [MN] I go to 'cause I do love to swim and that's a big help.
R:  That's great.
L:  But, um, [SIGH] --
R:  About how many la- -- h- how much do you -- would you -- I mean, I don't personally swim, uh, to -- as an exercise.  Do you -- do you find it helpful?  Do you really get a workout after doing that too?
L:  Oh, definite- and it's -- and it's much easier with the arthritis in my knees, uh, uh, it's much easier to exercise in the water because you're -- you're not putting the weight on your knees that --
R:  Exactly, uh-huh.
L:  -- you would.  Right, yeah.  So, it's -- that's a big help.
R:  [SIGH] And back to the Tai Chi; do you do it indoors or outdoors?  Like --
L:  Well, we're doing it indoors right now but, uh, if the weather's not too hot and not raining we do it outdoors but, uh, so far we've been doing it indoors 'cause we've had a lot of rain and, uh, uh, then we had terribly hot weather so -- too hot to be out.
R:  Mm.
L:  But, uh, it's -- it's interesting.  I like it a lot.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, I -- they actually offer, um, yoga and I'm not sure they offer Tai Chi at my gym but I -- I'm definitely gonna ask about it now.  So, you -- uh, do a lot of men take it or is it mostly women?
L:  Oh, it's all men and women.  Right.  And all ages, yeah.  It's a variety of people so, uh, be- -- I think it's -- it's, uh -- it limbers you.  Now maybe if I stick with it and -- and get a little more confident then maybe I could try yoga but I -- right now I don't think I could manage yoga.
R:  Mm.
L:  Uh --
R:  [SIGH] What -- what exactly is that?  You just like, uh, slow movements and swing back, you know, side to side whatever[?].
L:  Well, uh, we have -- we have warm ups.  We have warm ups first.  Um --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Just, uh, it's hard to explain.  You just kinda swing your arms back and forth and -- and, um, and move your -- move your, uh, weight on your, uh --
R:  From leg to leg, right?
L:  Right.  And --
R:  It's like --
L:  -- then, uh, we do that for, oh, quite a while and, uh, then start the, uh, slow movements and it's really good I think for balance.  The instructor, I can't believe he -- he can stand on one leg with his arms stretched out and, uh, [LIPSMACK] I haven't quite gotten that.  I -- I don't get my leg off of the --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- floor yet. [LAUGH]
R:  I'm sure you'll get there.
L:  Oh, yeah.  But, uh, you should look into it.  Or yoga.  I think yoga's probably good.
R:  Yeah, but that Tai Chi actually, um, [LIPSMACK] it doesn't just -- my mom actually suffers from rheumatoid arthritis and --
L:  Oh, well --
R:  Sh- she, uh, she's actually kind of overweight so I -- I think that a pool would be really good for her.
L:  Yes, it would.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wait.  I got a beep.  Just a minute. [NOISE] Are you s- --
R:  Yeah, I'm still here.
L:  Oh, okay.  I don't --
R:  Yeah, they -- they say you're not supposed to click over 'cause, um, it --
L:  Well, it --
R:  Sometimes the computer dis validates the call or something.
L:  Right.  Well, it prob- [NOISE] -- probably was a -- a tele marketer [NOISE] [LAUGH] anyway.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Oh, this is my first call.
R:  Yeah, mine too. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  But, uh --
R:  Kind of awkward [inaudible].  Um, what else?  Uh, let's see.
L:  Where do you live?
R:  I live in New York.
L:  Oh, okay.  Where abouts?
R:  New York City, Manhattan.
L:  Oh, how ni- -- I love --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- Manhattan.  
R:  Oh, where --
L:  I'm in -- I'm in Virginia though.
R:  Virginia.  Okay.
L:  But, uh, we, um -- years ago we were, uh -- my husband's retired military and we lived out in Long Island and we used to spend a lot of time in Manhattan doing the theater and -- and --
R:  Oh, that's great.
L:  -- the museums and all.  I just love it up there.
R:  Nice.
L:  But[?], uh --
R:  Yeah, it's -- it's a really good city.  I mean, especially like, uh, I guess that's probably why I'm in the gym and like, um, [LIPSMACK] not outdoors and doing those kind of exercises just 'cause living in -- being in the city it's --
L:  Right.
R:  It's not the same as --
L:  But you can get a l- -- you can do a lot of walking.
R:  Yeah, you can but it's [MN] -- the asphalt's not good.  Like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- for your shins and --
L:  How about Central Park?
R:  Central Park is nice and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I do jog the reservoir --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on weekends --
L:  Oh, that --
R:  -- with my girlfriend.
L:  That's good. [NOISE]
R:  She actually lives right across the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- street so it's pretty convenient.
L:  Oh, very good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, what else?
L:  I don't know.  That's --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- what I w- [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] Let's see.  
L:  [MN]
R:  Well, you -- you think ten minutes is not a long time but it kinda is.
L:  I guess it is when you don't know who you're talking to.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh, how old are you?
R:  I'm actually twenty four.
L:  Oh, you're a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- baby.  I'm s- --
R:  That's right, yeah.
L:  I'm seventy five. [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.  Oh, that's great to see that you're so active at that age.  
L:  Oh, yes.  Well, I feel, uh, fifty at least. [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.  Yeah, my -- my -- my -- actually my great grandmother she just recently started having heart problems but before -- like just up until a few years ago she was, uh, she'd walk all over --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- the place and do all her shopping herself and she was in great health and she never did any exercising.  I'm wondering if she actually should now. 
L:  Oh, I think so.  Um, [NOISE] because, uh, they say for arthritis that, uh, exercise is good even though it's, uh, painful sometimes you just don't overdo it.  Do what you can but tell her if she has access to a pool any place they have the best exercises to do in water --
R:  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  -- that are great for --
R:  It -- I mean, doesn't arthritis come from moving your joints?  I mean, like --
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- from --
L:  Well, it's li- --
R:  -- lack of cartilage or something in the joints, or ?
L:  Yeah, it's, uh, the cartilage thins out as you get older. [COUGH] Excuse me.
R:  It's okay.
L:  And, um, [LIPSMACK] so I have one hip replacement already --
R:  Wow.
L:  And, uh, doctor's talking to me now about maybe replacing my knees.  I've got really bad knees that --
R:  Wow.
L:  But I -- I keep fighting it. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, well that's the important thing.
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  I mean, the fact that you can again, you know, remain so active it's -- I find that incredible.
L:  Well, I refuse to give up. [LAUGH]
R:  You have any kids?
L:  I just have one daughter and two grand children and one great grandson.
R:  Wow.
L:  So, uh, yeah, my daughter is, uh, oh, my goodness.  My daughter is fifty five.  My, uh, grand daughter's thirty six.  My grandson is thirty two and then my great grandson is fifteen.  So 
R:  I have a little brother that's, uh, fifteen.  
L:  Oh, that's a bad age I think. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah?  
L:  Oh, I tell ya.  Well, you know, he wants to do things and -- and --
R:  Is he in sports?  Get him into football and --
L:  He -- he, um, he does a lot of skateboarding and basketball --
R:  That's --
L:  And, uh, course they -- they -- they live in Maryland.  They live a hundred miles from here so I don't see 'em as often as I'd like.
R:  I see.
L:  But, um, but he likes to -- oh, and he l- --
R:  Hello?
L:  N- -- yeah, I'm still --
R:  Oh, okay.  I thought I heard a click or something.
L:  No.  I heard a buzz so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I guess it's my call waiting but they can call back.
R:  Uh.
L:  I heard it again.
R:  [SIGH] Uh, so where -- where do you, uh, find out about this?
L:  W- about what?
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Oh, uh, I'm -- I, uh, s- -- have a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a girlfriend on the internet this morning that told me about it.
R:  On Craig list did she see it or ?
L:  Uh, she said she found it in Refunding Makes Sense.
R:  Refund --
L:  Refunding Makes Sense.  It's a refunders magazine.
R:  Okay.
L:  And, uh, she, uh -- I was on the internet this morning and she, uh, gave me the, uh, web address and so I went in and signed up.  I didn't think I'd hear from 'em so soon.
R:  Oh, they called you?  Oh, okay.  I see how it -- I -- you can actually call and initiate, um, [LIPSMACK] initiate a -- a -- a phone call.
L:  Right.  But, uh, I -- as I read it, uh, if you
