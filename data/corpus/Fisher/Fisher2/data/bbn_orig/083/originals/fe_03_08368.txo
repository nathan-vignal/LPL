L:  Health and fitness --
R:  -- and exercise.
L:  -- right, and exercising and so forth, yeah.
R:  Um, well, I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I do exercise probably four times a week.
L:  Four times a week?
R:  Yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I try to keep regular --
L:  I try too, you know, it's like three times a week and, uh, that's about it --
R:  So, what do you do?
L:  -- for me. [LAUGH] But, it's -- it's more than some people do, you know --
R:  Right, oh totally, I --
L:  -- really, so --
R:  -- I really like to stay fit.  I mean, I like to lead a active lifestyle in general. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah. [LAUGH] Uh-huh.
R:  So, um, I tend to do mostly -- the thing I enjoy the most is weight lifting.  Um --
L:  Is what -- excuse me?
R:  Weight lifting.
L:  Oh, yes, weight lifting, oh.
R:  Lift -- lift free weights and things like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, uh, I also enjoy, uh, getting out -- we got really nice bike trails out here --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so I tend to do a lot of biking when the weather's nice.
L:  Oh, biking, oh, that's great, I used to love that, you know, [LAUGH] I haven't done it, uh, for the past few years, so -- yeah.  That's a wonderful exercise, it's very freeing, it's very enjoyable.
R:  I just like even covering the mileage too. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So --
R:  Yes.
R:  -- it's pretty scenery and stuff.
L:  Mm, very nice.
R:  So, how about you, what -- what kind of things do you do?
L:  Uh, well I do, you know, the -- the speed walking, and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- walking quite a bit. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, that -- that's it for right now. [LAUGH] Yes, it's, um --
R:  I used to run a lot, um --
L:  Oh, yes?
R:  -- but I've kind of gotten bored with it. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I try to do short races and stuff now, but, um --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- um, I ran a marathon once but only once, that was enough.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, you did, well that's --
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  -- that's great, mhm.
R:  -- it was one of those things to check off and now I'm done with it and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- don't plan on going back.
L:  I see. [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  So -- I know --
L:  Well --
R:  -- New York has a big marathon --
L:  Pardon?
R:  -- like, they -- New York has a huge marathon.
L:  Oh, and -- oh does it -- oh my goodness, yes, and they usually, you know, come over the -- the Verrazano to Staten Island --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- through Staten Island.  The bake -- the bikers also, you know -- I think that's in September, [NOISE] yeah, bikes[?] quite a bit.  So, the, you know, they show pictures on the television of the Verrazano Bridge and various bridges --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that they run across and it's such a huge amount of people --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, my go- --
R:  I'm pretty sure you've got to qualify for it too --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I think.
L:  Yes.
R:  I've never tried to do that, I'm not a fast runner. [LAUGH]
L:  No.  I -- I just can't imagine -- it would be so stifling to have so -- to be closed in with so many runners, you know --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- at the same time, yeah.
R:  But then it's the excitement of the race --
L:  Right.
R:  -- too. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, absolutely, yes.
R:  I've known people that have run -- actually, I knew a guy that, um, actually has been traveling around and going -- running marathons in different states and even different --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- countries --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I think he ran, um -- two years ago he did a marathon a month for fourteen months.
L:  Oh, really.
R:  [LAUGH] And that is just too much. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I would -- my body --
L:  No, I have --
R:  -- would just get up and --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- fall over. [LAUGH]
L:  Some friends of the family I know there was a young man [NOISE] -- he would run and walk, you know, just the speed -- and he was in all the marathons, you know.  He was quite a runner and he was so lean, it seemed like he was, uh, you know -- was just bones --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- after a while.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause I think it was -- he was just so addicted to it, you know.  And he would run, you know, like, just, uh, to pick up his ride to go over the Verrazano to go to work --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and he'd leave his house -- he wouldn't take a bus or anything, he would -- he would do that, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.  No, I used to ride my bike to work --
L:  So, you know, a little bit of a distance away from where he lived, so --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- it was just constant, you know.
R:  I used to ride my bike to work but that was only eleven miles one way --
L:  That --
R:  -- so that wasn't too bad, that was pretty quick.
L:  No, no -- so -- yeah.  Well, there's a -- they -- you know, exercise is important, you know, even the little bit that I do as far as walking --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- three times a week , I mean, you know, really getting into it, and like I said before, there are so many people that -- that can't get started in, you know, anything --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so I -- I know I feel much more, uh, exhilarated, uh, it -- it lifts your spirits --
R:  Oh, after a work out I -- I usually work out after work --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, you know, kind of after -- I sit in front of a computer most of the time and so it's kind of -- you know, it's -- it's neat work but, you know, it's nice --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to be active and I get re-energized.  I come --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- home after a work out --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and be ready to do what I need to do at the home [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, that -- that's --
R:  -- kind of thing.
L:  -- that's true.  You know --
R:  So ...
L:  -- like I said, it gives you such a boost in -- in every way, you know [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- in a natural way and that's very good, really.
R:  And that's why I tend to -- so the weight lifting I can do year round, uh --
L:  Pardon, I didn't ...? [NOISE]
R:  -- so, that's nice.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause the biking's not so good out here in -- when it gets -- when the snow falls. [LAUGH]
L:  No. [LAUGH] I see.  Well, yeah.  At least as long as you're interested and, you know, keep it up. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  I, um, tend to hang out with people that also --
L:  That also -- yeah --
R:  -- you know, have similar interests.
L:  -- that -- that is  -- that --
R:  -- Do -- do -- do you walk in a group --
L:  -- reinforces -- pardon?
R:  -- or do you walk by yourself?
L:  No, I have a g- -- a -- a, you know, companion, uh --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, three different, uh, people that like to do that and they go along, yeah.
R:  Yeah, me too, I mean, I -- I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- lift with, uh, one -- one friend and then, uh --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- even -- we'll do long bike rides as groups with other [inaudible], you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- maybe five people --
L:  Oh. [NOISE]
R:  -- set out for a whole afternoon --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- or something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, yeah, no, I totally agree, it's a -- it's a social thing and I think it's --
L:  It is.
R:  -- you know, it's best to be healthy.
L:  It just brings you out and, like I said, it's a -- it's a really -- moo- -- uh, it changes your mood --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and you feel much better, physically, you know, [LIPSMACK] so that's very important. [LAUGH] So, yeah -- so ...
R:  Well --
L:  I don't know --
R:  -- is that about ten minutes? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I don't know.
R:  So, we'll see.
L:  Uh, a little bit longer.
R:  I just got reactivated, so --
L:  Mm?
R:  I just got reactivated on this thing, something was --
L:  Y- --
R:  -- wrong with my account and -- 
L:  Uh-oh.
R:  -- I didn't know what it was so I haven't talked in months.
L:  Huh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  So, [LIPSMACK] uh, have you ever, uh, come to New York or ...?
R:  Um, let's see, actua- -- I've hun- hung out on the West Side, I go skiing -- there's a go -- another, uh, physical activity --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I've gone up to Holiday Valley a couple of times.
L:  Oh, really, uh-huh.
R:  But that's over by Buffalo --
L:  Yeah, oh, it must be --
R:  Um, I haven't been to New York City in -- in quite some time.
L:  Uh.
R:  I was real young when I was there.

R:  -- I'd like to come out. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, it is -- it's nice, you know -- it's a nice city.
R:  How's the weather these days?
L:  Oh, we had so much rain, um --
R:  Yeah, we're getting lots of --
L:  -- oh --
R:  -- floods out here.
L:  -- April, May, June, it just constant, it was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- terrible.
R:  I -- I think --

R:  -- the whole mid west and east is getting that.
L:  Yeah, really?
R:  Yeah, we're getting swamped out here. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh, really.  A lot of rain, huh?
R:  Yeah, they're getting, uh -- just north of me a couple of towns, there's some --
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- serious flooding --
L:  Oh, my.
R:  -- they've been getting -- I don't know --
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  -- they got businesses that don't have a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- basement any more.
L:  Oh, wow.  Yeah, uh, we had quite a downpour today.  I was so surprised I was s- -- you know, didn't -- didn't notice it at all, I was busy and didn't look out and hear anything and when I went out it was just a deluge of [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, the streets were running.  But, it didn't last very long, so, you know, [LIPSMACK] and it cooled everything, we've had such a hot spell here, it's unbelievable.
R:  It's been quite hot and humid out here, I just --
L:  Oh, is it warm there?
R:  -- I just turned on my air conditioning just for the weekend --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and that's the first time I've really had it on for this long --
L:  Oh, I see.  No, we've had --
R:  -- and I have no intentions of turning it off. [LAUGH]
L:  No. [LAUGH] No, first, uh, you know, we had to replace our air conditioner and we just did that in the last few days and, uh, we -- no, we had long -- you know, the high standing fans --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- going all the time. [LAUGH] And thank god we have the air conditioning back, so -- yeah, it's a big help.
R:  Well, I'm not fond of heat and the heat actually cuts into my --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- weight lifting and other stuff, I just --
L:  I --
R:  -- when it gets --
L:  -- doesn't it, yeah.
R:  -- so hot I don't have the energy --
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  Well, you know, when it's that hot and I go out and walk I take a lot of water with me --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and you're not as fast, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, you -- so -- so you do feel it, it does cut into everything, you know, that you do, you know.
R:  But everything is nice and green, isn't it? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, [NOISE] yes, yeah, it is.  But, I've -- I've never seen a spring, you know, we had our last snow in -- in -- it was in April, you know.
R:  Really, you had snow then, okay, okay.
L:  Oh, yes, we had a real snowstorm and then from there it just was so damp and cold and, you know, w- we just didn't see the sun --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for so long --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that, um, you know, that really was -- was terrible.  It was just, like -- like, everybody was wearing a, you know coats, jackets, it was, uh, really bad.  But in the last couple of weeks though, we're in summer, [LAUGH] eighty, ninety --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- almost a hundred degrees [LAUGH] --
R:  Wow, well we haven't had that --
L:  -- some days.
R:  -- we've been up in low nineties, that's as hot as it's got.
L:  Oh, yeah --
R:  But, uh, that's --
L:  -- yeah, we went up to a hundred and five --
R:  That's too hot for me.
L:  -- so I was just dripping, you know, I was just -- oh, it was just terrible, you know.  But, [SIGH] at least the sun was shining and so forth, you know.
