IS I TRANSLATE THINGS INTO THOUGHTS AND THEN I CONTROL THE THOUGHT  (fe_03_08356-A-0049)
SO LIKE WHAT WHAT DOES YOUR STOMACH THE MUSCLES IN YOUR STOMACH REPRESENT TO YOU WHAT IS IT AND SO [LIPSMACK]  (fe_03_08356-A-0050)
THAT'S WHAT I FIGURE OUT  (fe_03_08356-A-0051)
THAT MUSCLE I ALSO KNOW THAT MUSCLES AREN'T SELF [NOISE] ACTING  (fe_03_08356-A-0052)
THAT WE GOVERN OUR MUSCLES THEY DON'T OPERATE [NOISE] UNCONSCIOUSLY WITHOUT US  (fe_03_08356-A-0053)
[NOISE] AND [NOISE] SO UM [NOISE] I HAVE TO COME AT IT FROM THAT POINT BECAUSE IF I'M COMING AT IT STRICTLY FROM MUSCLE [LIPSMACK]  (fe_03_08356-A-0054)
UM  (fe_03_08356-A-0055)
THAT'S NOT ONLY NON [NOISE] INSPIRING I DON'T THINK IT'S VERY EFFECTIVE  (fe_03_08356-A-0056)
AND UM  (fe_03_08356-A-0057)
I THINK THAT LIKE I SHARED WITH THE OTHER PEOPLE I SPOKE TO THAT [NOISE] I BELIEVE WE [NOISE] UM GET WE DON'T GET FIT THAT WE DEMONSTRATE FITNESS [NOISE]  (fe_03_08356-A-0058)
AND [NOISE] GETTING FIT IMPLIES THAT IT EVAPORATES AND THAT IF WE DON'T DO IT ON A REGULAR BASIS WE'RE OUT OF LUCK  (fe_03_08356-A-0059)
WHEREAS DEMONSTRATING FITNESS MEANS THAT [NOISE] JUST GETTING OUT OF BED AND WALKING INTO [NOISE] THE KITCHEN IS UH SOME DEGREE OF FITNESS [NOISE]  (fe_03_08356-A-0060)
THAT WE ALREADY HAVE AND [NOISE] THAT [NOISE] WE'RE DEMONSTRATING [NOISE] FOR MOTIVES THAT ARE UM  (fe_03_08356-A-0061)
YOU KNOW BETTER THAN MUSCLE [NOISE] LIKE IN THE BIBLE UM I THINK PAUL WROTE BODILY EXERCISE PROFITS A LITTLE  (fe_03_08356-A-0062)
AND FOR A LONG TIME I THOUGHT IT WAS SAYING DON'T EXERCISE BUT HE DIDN'T SAY EXERCISE PROFITS A LITTLE  (fe_03_08356-A-0063)
HE SAID BODILY EXERCISE PROFITS A LITTLE  (fe_03_08356-A-0064)
AND TO ME I THINK HE'S TALKING ABOUT MOTIVE IF OUR MOTIVE IS JUST MUSCLE  (fe_03_08356-A-0065)
UM WE'RE GONNA BE OUT OF LUCK BUT IF OUR MOTIVE [NOISE] IS TO DEMONSTRATE  (fe_03_08356-A-0066)
GRACE AND ENDURANCE AND POWER AND [NOISE] [NOISE] [LIPSMACK]  (fe_03_08356-A-0068)
WELL YOU YOU HAVE TO THINK  (fe_03_08356-A-0069)
UM I'M GONNA EAT DINNER BEFORE YOU MAKE IT SO YOU'VE GOT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO BEFORE YOU DO IT AND WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS YOUR REASON FOR DOING SOMETHING CAN'T JUST BE  (fe_03_08356-A-0070)
FOR ME IT CAN'T BE IT CAN'T JUST BE MUSCLE IT'S THE MY MOTIVE HAS GOT TO BE TO DEMONSTRATE JOY IT'S GOT TO BE TO DEMONSTRATE FITNESS  (fe_03_08356-A-0071)
I HEARD YOU SAY THAT HAVING A GOOD BODY MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD  (fe_03_08356-A-0074)
AND THAT UM HAVING A GOOD BODY IS A GOOD THING  (fe_03_08356-A-0075)
I AGREE I AGREE BUT [LIPSMACK]  (fe_03_08356-A-0077)
UM I I ALSO BELIEVE THAT  (fe_03_08356-A-0078)
IF OUR MOTIVES INCLUDES THOUGHTS THAT ARE BIGGER THAN UH JUST US  (fe_03_08356-A-0079)
THAT WE [SIGH]  (fe_03_08356-A-0080)
TAP INTO UM  (fe_03_08356-A-0081)
[LIPSMACK] A UNIVERSAL POWER  (fe_03_08356-A-0082)
THAT AB- THAT HELPS EVERYBODY  (fe_03_08356-A-0083)
AND THAT IF WE'RE IF WE'RE DEALING WITH THE SUBJECT MATTER THAT SAYS SMALL AS JUST ONE PERSON  (fe_03_08356-A-0084)
WE DON'T GET WE DON'T TAP INTO THIS UNIVERSAL POWER AND SO THAT'S WHY THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I  (fe_03_08356-A-0085)
I CHECK MY MOTIVES AND I MAKE MY MOTIVE BE AS SPIRITUAL AS POSSIBLE  (fe_03_08356-A-0086)
BEFORE I DO SOMETHING AND  (fe_03_08356-A-0087)

AND THEN I ROTATE IN A CIRCLE  (fe_03_08356-A-0092)
SO THAT I'M GOING FROM MY BACK TO MY STOMACH WITHOUT USING MY ARMS AND WITHOUT USING MY LEGS I USE MY WHOLE BODY TO TURN  (fe_03_08356-A-0093)
AND YOU DO THIS ABOUT THIRTY TIMES AND BOY YOU CAN FEEL THAT IN YOUR STOMACH  (fe_03_08356-A-0094)
SO IT'S KIND OF LIKE AN INCHWORM IN THE WATER FLIPPING AROUND FROM SIDE TO SIDE IN A CIRCLE  (fe_03_08356-A-0095)
