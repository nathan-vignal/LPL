YEAH YEAH I'VE I'VE STARTED BICYCLING WITH A FRIEND OF MINE BECAUSE  (fe_03_08371-A-0069)
THE THE EXERCISE LIKE HE LIKES TO RIDE OFF ROAD SO THE EXERCISE IN THAT IS MORE LIKE TRYING TO STAY ON AND BALANCE AND USING THE STRENGTH TO GET UP ALL THE SHORT HILLS AND DOWN HILLS SO IT'S NOT SO HOT  (fe_03_08371-A-0070)
AND IT'S USUALLY SHADED AND IT'S NOT LIKE A CONSTANT ENDURANCE WORKOUT LIKE RUNNING OR PLAYING SOCCER OR SOMETHING  (fe_03_08371-A-0071)
