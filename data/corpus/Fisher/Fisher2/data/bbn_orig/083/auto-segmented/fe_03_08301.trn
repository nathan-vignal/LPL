OF LISTS UM  (fe_03_08301-B-0013)
A SELECTION THAT THE CHILDREN CAN READ FROM OR PERHAPS EVEN  (fe_03_08301-B-0014)

YOU KNOW PARENTS SHOULD UH BE MORE INVOLVED IN THE WHOLE SELECTION PROCESS  (fe_03_08301-B-0028)
WELL I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE CENSORED BUT I THINK THAT ALL ACCOUNTS  (fe_03_08301-B-0029)
OF HISTORY SHOULD BE  (fe_03_08301-B-0030)
YOU KNOW PORTRAYED EQUALLY AND PROPERLY  (fe_03_08301-B-0031)

HISTORY ITSELF YOU KNOW AND THE WAY THAT IT'S  (fe_03_08301-B-0036)
DELIVERED IN IN BOOKS FOR THE YOU KNOW EDUCATIONAL CURRICULUM  (fe_03_08301-B-0037)

DID IT COVER CENSORSHIP UNDER ANY OTHER ASPECTS OF UH EDUCATIONAL BOOKS OR WAS IT JUST  (fe_03_08301-B-0041)
YEAH WELL BASICALLY I THINK THAT ANYTHING YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08301-B-0042)
SEXUALLY CONNOTATED SHOULD BE CENSORED UM  (fe_03_08301-B-0043)
AND  (fe_03_08301-B-0044)
JUST BECAUSE OF THE OF THE SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE PERHAPS ANY YOU KNOW RELIGIOUS UM  (fe_03_08301-B-0045)
INNUENDOES SHOULD ALSO BE  (fe_03_08301-B-0046)

AS A TEACHER MYSELF I MAY BELIEVE IN A CERTAIN THING AND I MAY WANT TO SHARE YOU KNOW THAT BELIEF WITH MY STUDENTS OR READ A BOOKS RELATED TO THAT YOU KNOW IT'S JUST IT'S JUST IT'S  (fe_03_08301-B-0050)
SAFE TO JUST YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08301-B-0051)

I THINK THAT UH HIGH SCHOOL THOSE STUDENTS SHOULD HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE FREEDOM AS TO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY CAN TAKE IN  (fe_03_08301-B-0065)
UM YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEY'RE OLDER AND BECAUSE THEY'RE AT A STAGE IN LIFE WHERE THEY'RE BEGINNING TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS AND  (fe_03_08301-B-0066)
YOU KNOW PARENTS SHOULD STILL HAVE A PART IN THE SELECTION PROCESS I BELIEVE REGARDLESS TO WHETHER IT'S ELEMENTARY AGED OR UH IT'S HIGH SCHOOL AGED  (fe_03_08301-B-0067)
KIDS BUT UM  (fe_03_08301-B-0068)
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHAT DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD  (fe_03_08301-B-0069)
YEAH WELL IF YOU LOOK AT THE THE VERY ORIGINAL VERSIONS OF THOSE FABLES THAT WERE UH WRITTEN  (fe_03_08301-B-0070)

AND WHEN YOU FIND THE ORIGINAL VERSIONS OF THE STORIES I MEAN THEY'RE VERY VIOLENT SEXUAL IN NATURE NOW OF COURSE THE VERSION THAT WE HAVE NOW  (fe_03_08301-B-0072)

NOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE  (fe_03_08301-B-0078)
READING WHAT VERSIONS OF THOSE FABLES THEY'RE READING TO THE KIDS NOW OF COURSE IF THEY'RE READING THE ORIGINAL VERSION THEN SURE THEY SHOULD BE BANNED  (fe_03_08301-B-0079)
BUT UM AND THEN A LOT OF THE THE THE INNUENDOES IN THOSE STORIES ARE KIND OF MORE SO FOR ADULTS SO CHILDREN REALLY CAN'T PICK UP ON THOSE BUT IF YOU WANT TO GET INTO  (fe_03_08301-B-0080)
YOU KNOW THE SUBCONSCIOUS AND SUBLIMINAL MESSAGES AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE THEN YOU MAY  (fe_03_08301-B-0081)
WANT TO CONSIDER BUT ONCE AGAIN I THINK THAT THAT  (fe_03_08301-B-0082)
FALLS ALONG THE LINES OF THE PARENTS HAVING THEIR HAND IN IT BECAUSE IT THE TEACHER CAN ONLY YOU KNOW TEACH THEIR CURRICULUM  (fe_03_08301-B-0083)
