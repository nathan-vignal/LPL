YOU DON'T WANT TO LEARN THINGS SO FAST YOU KNOW AT TOO YOUNG OF AN AGE  (fe_03_08300-B-0033)
THAT IS THE WAY TO INTRODUCE THOSE AS THE KIDS GET OLDER  (fe_03_08300-B-0034)
YOU KNOW THAT'D BE BETTER BUT SOMETHING  (fe_03_08300-B-0035)
GRAPHIC OR SOMETHING TALKING TOO MUCH ABOUT SEX AT AN EARLY AGE THAT COULD MESS THAT CHILD UP FOR LATER ON IN LIFE YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08300-B-0036)

TOUCHY FOR CERTAIN PEOPLE OR CERTAIN RELIGIONS AND THINGS LIKE THAT  (fe_03_08300-B-0046)

THEY DO YEAH THEY DO  (fe_03_08300-B-0049)
MHM  (fe_03_08300-B-0050)
MHM I THINK THEY SHOULD MAKE LIKE SOME KIND OF RATING FOR BOOKS YOU KNOW IF THEY'RE GOING TO SCHOOL LIKE THEY DID FOR MOVIES  (fe_03_08300-B-0051)
THEY SHOULD MAKE SOME KIND OF RATING FOR WHAT LEVEL THIS BOOK COULD BE BROUGHT IN TO THE SCHOOL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT I MEAN THEY MIGHT HAVE THAT IN SOME STATES BUT I KNOW IN GEORGIA WE DON'T HAVE THINGS LIKE THAT  (fe_03_08300-B-0052)

BUT IF YOU LOOK AT OTHER PEOPLE THEY WOULD PROBABLY THINK THAT'S WITCHCRAFT AND THIS AND THAT SO  (fe_03_08300-B-0059)
THAT'S KIND OF A TOUCHY THING IN THE BEGINNING TOO THOUGH BECAUSE THAT CAN LEAD IT CAN BREAK OFF INTO SO MANY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS  (fe_03_08300-B-0060)

A RATING SYSTEM FOR THINGS  (fe_03_08300-B-0072)
YOU KNOW THEY SHOULD LIKE SIT DOWN A GROUP OF TEACHERS AND THE TEACHERS SHOULD SAY OKAY THIS BOOK IS ACCEPTED UH WE CAN BRING THIS BOOK IT OR WHY SHOULDN'T THIS BOOK BE IN HERE YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE THAT  (fe_03_08300-B-0073)
AND THEN I THINK ADDS A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE KIDS ARE GONNA WANT TO KNOW IT ANYWAY BECAUSE THEY SHOULD BRING IN LIKE ONE OR TWO TO KINDA MIX IT IN A LITTLE BIT SO KIDS CAN KINDA GET THEIR MIND THINKING ABOUT THINGS BUT DON'T JUST BLOCK EVERYTHING UP PERIOD  (fe_03_08300-B-0074)
TRUE  (fe_03_08300-B-0075)
TRUE  (fe_03_08300-B-0076)

AREAS JUST GO IN AND SAY OKAY WILL THIS BOOK BE APPROPRIATE YES OR NO YOU KNOW BRING IT IN OR LEAVE THIS BOOK OUT OR  (fe_03_08300-B-0082)
LEAVE THIS BOOK IN A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE IT'S KINDA TEACHING YOU ABOUT THIS EVEN THOUGH IT HAS THIS AND THIS THE CHILD COULD STILL LEARN FROM  (fe_03_08300-B-0083)
THE OTHER THINGS TO RELATE TO THE OTHER THINGS DO YOU GET WHAT I'M SAYING  (fe_03_08300-B-0084)
