WELL  (fe_03_08354-B-0008)
UM  (fe_03_08354-B-0009)
WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER I SWAM BUT NOT COMPETITIVELY  (fe_03_08354-B-0010)
AND THEN WHEN I MOVED TO HAWAII I STARTED DOING  (fe_03_08354-B-0011)
UM  (fe_03_08354-B-0012)
OUTRIGGER CANOE PADDLING WHICH IS GREAT FUN HUGE AMOUNT OF WORK BUT THEY MADE ME RUN AND I JOINED PADDLING BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO RUN  (fe_03_08354-B-0013)
AND I WAS HORRIFIED WHEN THEY TOLD ME I HAD TO RUN AND SO WHAT'S FUNNY NOW IS  (fe_03_08354-B-0014)
THIRTY YEARS LATER IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE WAYS TO DO  (fe_03_08354-B-0015)
TO DO EXERCISE I LOVE RUNNING NOW AND SO I RUN I DO TRIATHLONS  (fe_03_08354-B-0016)
I DO LITTLE ONES UM LIKE THE THE LAVAMAN WHICH IS THE OLYMPIC DISTANCE  (fe_03_08354-B-0017)

I COME IN THIRD OR FOURTH IN MY AGE GROUP BUT I FIGURE IF I WAIT LONG ENOUGH I'LL COME IN [LAUGHTER] I'LL COME  (fe_03_08354-B-0019)
IN YEAH SO ANYWAY UM I UM I JUST READ THIS BOOK RECENTLY CALLED MIND BODY AND SPORTS  (fe_03_08354-B-0020)
UH WHERE HE SAYS THAT UM YOUR GOAL HAS TO BE TO DO ANYTHING EFFORTLESSLY  (fe_03_08354-B-0021)
AND I USED TO THINK YOU KNOW POPPOV TALKS ABOUT [LIPSMACK]  (fe_03_08354-B-0022)
REACH  (fe_03_08354-B-0023)
REACH RHYTHM AND RELAX AND SO I'VE BEEN WORKING ON RHYTHM AND RELAX BUT THIS IS A NEW ONE EFFORTLESS SO I'M TRYING THIS LATELY  (fe_03_08354-B-0024)
YEAH WELL I ALWAYS FOUND IT A LITTLE BIT CONFUSING TO DO RELAXED AND GO FAST BUT BUT  (fe_03_08354-B-0025)
I THINK I'VE FIGURED IT OUT AND UM THE  (fe_03_08354-B-0026)
I I PERSONALLY THING THAT EVERYTHING IS EVERYTHING IN THIS WORLD IS PURELY MENTAL  (fe_03_08354-B-0027)
AND BECAUSE EVERYTHING I THINK LONG ENOUGH USUALLY HAPPENS TO ME  (fe_03_08354-B-0028)
AND SO UM  (fe_03_08354-B-0029)
SO I THINK THE RELAXATION AND THE RHYTHM ARE MENTAL QUALITIES THAT WE DEMONSTRATE PHYSICALLY  (fe_03_08354-B-0030)
AND SO  (fe_03_08354-B-0031)
UM  (fe_03_08354-B-0032)
EFFORTLESS IS A NEW ONE IT'S LIKE THEY SAY THAT BEING IN THE ZONE ONE OF THE THINGS EVERYONE DESCRIBES IT AS IS EFFORTLESS THAT YOU CAN IT LIKE YOU'RE NOT EVEN PARTICIPATING IT'S JUST DO MO- GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS  (fe_03_08354-B-0033)
SO I'VE ONLY HAD THAT HAPPEN A COUPLE OF TIMES IN SWIMMING AND MAYBE ONE TIME ONE TIME I HAD IT HAPPEN IN PADDLING  (fe_03_08354-B-0034)
ANOTHER TIME I HAD IT A COUPLE OF TIMES IN RUNNING BUT RUNNING TO ME IS REALLY NICE BECAUSE IF I START OFF SLOW I RUN AROUND A TRACK AT MY SCHOOL  (fe_03_08354-B-0036)
AND THE VIEW IS GORGEOUS AT THIS PLACE AND  (fe_03_08354-B-0037)
AND SO I TIME EACH LAP AROUND AND UM I'VE BEEN I STARTED OFF DOING AROUND TWELVE TWELVE MINUTE MILES AND I'M NOW DOWN TO SOMEWHERE BETWEEN EIGHT AND NINE  (fe_03_08354-B-0038)
AND I'M REAL HAPPY ABOUT THAT YOU KNOW YEAH 'CAUSE WHEN I WAS TWENTY YEARS OLD THERE'S NO WAY I COULD GO THIS FAST YOU KNOW SO  (fe_03_08354-B-0039)
THEY SAY WHAT DO YOU DO NO- I TELL PEOPLE NOW THAT I'VE HIT FIFTY PLUS I'M FASTER AT BIKING FASTER AT SWIMMING AND FASTER AT RUNNING  (fe_03_08354-B-0040)
[LAUGHTER] BUT UM ANYWAY SO  (fe_03_08354-B-0041)
UM  (fe_03_08354-B-0042)
HUH  (fe_03_08354-B-0043)
HUH YEAH I READ A STUDY IN THE UM  (fe_03_08354-B-0044)
THE MEDICAL JOURNAL THE THING THAT THEY PUT OUR YEARLY THAT SAID THIS WAS IN NINETY  (fe_03_08354-B-0046)
NINE TWO THAT SAID THAT UM  (fe_03_08354-B-0047)
[LIPSMACK] MEN WHO MARRY WOMEN THAT ARE MORE EDUCATED THAN THEM DIE SOONER THAN MEN WHO MARRY WOMEN WHO ARE LESS EDUCATED THAT THEM  (fe_03_08354-B-0048)
SO AFTER READING THAT I'M NOT TOO I'M TOO UM UH I DON'T BELIEVE MOST STUDIES I READ  (fe_03_08354-B-0049)
[LAUGHTER] I'M NOT SAYING YOURS IS WRONG I'M JUST SAYING THAT YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08354-B-0050)
STUDIES CAN STUDIES CAN BE FUNNY YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE  (fe_03_08354-B-0051)
[LAUGHTER] BUT ANYWAY UM FITNESS YEAH I I THINK I SHARED THIS WITH THE LAST PERSON I SPOKE I THOUGHT THE TOPIC WOULD CHANGE EACH TIME BUT IT DIDN'T AND UH  (fe_03_08354-B-0052)
AND THE AND I DISCOVERED YEARS AGO SOMETHING I READ ABOUT WE DON'T GET FIT WE DEMONSTRATE FITNESS  (fe_03_08354-B-0053)
AND GET FIT IMPLIES THAT WE'RE RUNNING OUT ALL THE TIME AND THAT WE HAVE TO ACCUMULATE IT WHICH IS WHAT THE INDUSTRY WANTS YOU TO THINK WHEREAS DEMONSTRATING FITNESS TO ME MEANS THE WAY I FIGURED IT OUT  (fe_03_08354-B-0054)
WAS THAT IF SOMEBODY WAS NINE HUNDRED POUNDS IF THEY COULD STILL WALK ACROSS THE ROOM  (fe_03_08354-B-0055)
THEY WERE DEMONSTRATING SOME DEGREE OF FITNESS AS OPPOSED TO SOMEBODY THAT WEIGHT WHO'S JUST BEDRIDDEN  (fe_03_08354-B-0056)
SO  (fe_03_08354-B-0057)
FITNESS IS ON A CONTINUUM  (fe_03_08354-B-0058)
I THINK UM WITH  (fe_03_08354-B-0059)
UM YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08354-B-0060)
[SIGH] IF YOU THINK IT'S LIKE IT'S LIKE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN  (fe_03_08354-B-0061)
THE UM STUDENT CENTERED LEARNING AND TEACHER CENTERED LEARNING YOU KNOW TEACHER CENTERED LEARNING BELIEVES THAT  (fe_03_08354-B-0062)
YOU KNOW OPEN YOUR MOUTH I'LL POUR IN THE INFORMATION WHEREAS UH STUDENT CENTERED LEARNING BELIEVES YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND ALL I DO IS FACILITATE YOU FIGURING IT OUT AND SO I THINK FITNESS IS LIKE THAT TOO  (fe_03_08354-B-0063)
I THINK THAT WE DEMONSTRATE  (fe_03_08354-B-0064)
FITNESS WHICH I THINK IS A SPIRITUAL QUALITY  (fe_03_08354-B-0065)
AND UH  (fe_03_08354-B-0066)
AND SO THEREFORE THERE'S NOT REASON TO FEEL DISCOURAGED NO MATTER WHAT LEVEL WE'RE AT OR WHEREVER WE START  (fe_03_08354-B-0067)
IT'S PERSONAL  (fe_03_08354-B-0068)
