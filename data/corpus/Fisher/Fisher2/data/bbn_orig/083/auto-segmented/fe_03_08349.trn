[NOISE]  (fe_03_08349-B-0014)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08349-B-0015)
NO NO THAT'S WHAT I MEANT I MEA- WHAT I MEAN WAS WHAT I SHOULD HAVE SAID PROBABLY WAS DO YOU EVER ENTER RUNS WITH A WHOLE LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE  (fe_03_08349-B-0016)
YEAH [LAUGHTER] 'CAUSE  (fe_03_08349-B-0017)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08349-B-0019)
RIGHT WELL I LIKE THIS TOPIC BECAUSE UM I'VE LEARNED A WHOLE LOT OF STUFF ABOUT FITNESS OVER THE LAST FORTY FIVE YEARS AND UM I RUN I RUN AS WELL AND YEAH AND  (fe_03_08349-B-0020)
PARDON  (fe_03_08349-B-0021)
UM I LIVE IN HAWAII  (fe_03_08349-B-0023)
WELL HAWAII IS HILLS  (fe_03_08349-B-0024)
THEY'RE E- EVEN EVEN THE BEACH ISN'T FLAT AND UM THERE'S A CROSS COUNTRY COACH AT THE SCHOOL THAT I TEACH AT THAT SAYS YOUR H- HILLS ARE YOUR ALLIES  (fe_03_08349-B-0025)
AND UM MARY BAKER EDDIE ALSO SAYS TRANSLATES THING INTO THOUGHTS  (fe_03_08349-B-0026)
AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE BEEN DOING OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS WHICH I'VE ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATING BEAUTIFULLY DURING MY RUNNING  (fe_03_08349-B-0027)
BETTER THAN OTHER THINGS ALTHOUGH I DID MANAGE TO USE THIS IN BIKING AS WELL IS UM  (fe_03_08349-B-0028)
RUN WITH  (fe_03_08349-B-0029)
UM WITH THE GOAL TO BE RELAXED AND HAVE IT EFFORTLESS  (fe_03_08349-B-0030)
AND ALSO I READ SOMETHING RECENTLY THAT SAID THAT UM MOUTH BREATHING IS EMERGENCY BREATHING AND THAT IF YOU CAN DO AS MUCH RUNNING AS POSSIBLE BREATHING ONLY THROUGH YOUR NOSE WHAT YOU DO  (fe_03_08349-B-0031)
RIGHT AND WHEN YOU BREATHE THROUGH YOUR NOSE YOU'RE ALSO GIVING YOUR HEART A CHANCE TO SLOW DOWN AND GET THE OXYGEN IT NEEDS SLOWER BECAUSE WHEN YOU BREATHE THROUGH YOUR MOUTH IT'S RACING TO GET  (fe_03_08349-B-0033)
RIGHT AND WHEN WHEN I FINISHED THE UM THE LAVAMAN THE SECOND TIME IT WAS REALLY HOT CONDITIONS AND I  (fe_03_08349-B-0034)
I NEARLY COLLAPSED IT TOOK ME THREE HOURS TO GET MY BREATH BACK AND I THOUGHT IT WAS FOR OTHER REASONS AND THEN I WENT HEY WAIT A MINUTE IF I'D TRAINED MYSELF IN NOSE BREATHING  (fe_03_08349-B-0035)
I WOULDN'T BE DOING THIS AS DESPERATELY AS I WAS THAT YOU KNOW SO I'M ON A I'M I'M PRACTISING NOW FORCING MYSELF TO BREATHE ONLY THROUGH MY NOSE  (fe_03_08349-B-0036)
BUT I ALSO WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING IS WHEN I UM RUN OR WHEN I UH ENTER UH RUNS WITH PEOPLE I I REPEAT EITHER QUOTES FROM THE BIBLE THAT I LIKE  (fe_03_08349-B-0037)
OR UM MUSIC THAT IS UPLIFTING OR HYMNS THAT ARE UPLIFTING  (fe_03_08349-B-0038)
AND IT AND A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT WHAT I'M AND I GET PEOPLE CRITICIZING ME FOR THIS BECAUSE THEY SAY I'M DOING  (fe_03_08349-B-0039)
UM OUT OF BODY KIND OF STUFF THAT YOU CAN'T THEY THEY THINK YOU CAN'T COORDINATE THIS WITH WHAT YOU'RE DOING  (fe_03_08349-B-0040)
BUT I FIND IT DOES IT HAS THE EXACT OPPOSITE EFFECT THAT WHEN I'M DOING THIS I CAN THINK ON FIVE OR SIX DIFFERENT LEVELS AT A TIME LIKE A COMPUTER THAT'S GOT DIFFERENT DIFFERENT UM WINDOWS  (fe_03_08349-B-0041)
YEAH AND UM AND I THINK WE'RE MORE INTELLIGENT THAN A COMPUTER BECAUSE WE BUILT THEM  (fe_03_08349-B-0042)
AND SO IF A COMPUTER CAN DO IT WHY CAN'T WE AND IT'S REALLY COOL I GET I'M AND YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT THEY CALL BEING IN THE ZONE HASN'T HAPPENED TO ME TOO MANY TIMES BUT IT'S HAPPENED ENOUGH  (fe_03_08349-B-0043)
THAT I LOVE I LOVE RUNNING AND UM  (fe_03_08349-B-0044)
AND ALSO I HAVE A ANOTHER FRIEND THAT TOLD ME THAT WE DON'T RUN TO GET FIT WE RUN BECAUSE WE ARE FIT  (fe_03_08349-B-0045)
AND IT TOOK ME ABOUT FIVE YEARS TO FIGURE THAT OUT  (fe_03_08349-B-0046)
BUT GET  (fe_03_08349-B-0047)
RIGHT GET FIT IMPLIES THAT WHAT WE HAVE EVAPORATES AND THAT'S WHAT THE FITNESS INDUSTRY TELLS US THAT UNLESS YOU GET THIS AND UNLESS YOU DO THAT UNLESS YOU PAY ME  (fe_03_08349-B-0048)
UM THIS IS GONNA EVAPORATE AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE ANYTHING YOU'RE GONNA BE LESS THAN ZERO  (fe_03_08349-B-0049)
AT WHEREAS DEMONSTRATING THAT WE ARE FIT IMPLIES THAT EVEN SOMEBODY WHO'S A HUNDRED LIKE A THOUSAND POUNDS IF THEY CAN STILL WALK ACROSS THE ROOM AND ARE NOT BEDRIDDEN  (fe_03_08349-B-0050)
THEY'RE DEMONSTRATING SOME DEGREE OF FITNESS  (fe_03_08349-B-0051)
SO THAT ANYTHING WE DO IS DEMONSTRATING FITNESS JOY  (fe_03_08349-B-0052)
BALANCE EQUILIBRIUM UM STRENGTH UM AND I DON'T BELIEVE THESE QUALITIES ARE JUST MATERIAL ANYWAY I THINK THEY'RE THEY'RE SOMETHING BIGGER YEAH SO  (fe_03_08349-B-0053)
THAT'S WHAT I THAT'S WHAT I DO WHEN I AND WHEN I DID THE LAVAMAN [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08349-B-0054)
WELL  (fe_03_08349-B-0055)
WHAT I DID LAST TIME WAS THERE'S LIKE SEVEN OR EIGHT BIG HILLS ON THE ON THE BIKE AND THE FIRST BIG HILL  (fe_03_08349-B-0056)

UM I VISUALIZED THAT IT WOULD BE COOL DAY SLIGHT OVERCAST A BIT OF A BREEZE NO HEAVY WIND  (fe_03_08349-B-0059)
'CAUSE THE FIRST TIME I DID IT THE WIND WAS ATROCIOUS AND UM THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED BUT I MADE THE MISTAKE OF NOT VISUALIZING THE RUN THE RUN I FELT LIKE I WAS A POTATO IN AN OVEN  (fe_03_08349-B-0060)
IT WAS HOT THERE WAS NO WIND AND THIS AREA USUALLY HAS NICE GALES BLOWING YOU KNOW [LAUGHTER] SO NEXT YEAR I'M VISUALIZING THE WHOLE THING INSTEAD OF JUST THE JUST THE BIKE [NOISE] BUT ANYWAY  (fe_03_08349-B-0061)

WELL I I DON'T CALL IT GOING OFF THE WAGON I JUST CALL IT YOU KNOW UM  (fe_03_08349-B-0072)
I I EASE OFF FOR VARIOUS REASONS AND UM WHEN I'M WHEN I'M DOING IT IT'S UH EVERY OTHER DAY BECAUSE WHAT I DO IS  (fe_03_08349-B-0073)
I UM I SWIM OR BIKE ON THE OFF DAYS  (fe_03_08349-B-0074)
AND UM BECAUSE I WANNA MAKE I MADE MY BIKE MUCH FASTER I TOOK OFF ALMOST FORTY FIVE MINUTES OFF THE BIKE  (fe_03_08349-B-0075)
