L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?  [SIGH]
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  I am fine.  My name's Richard, I'm in Seattle, Washington.  [SIGH]
R:  Hi Richard, I'm Miranda.  I'm in Minneapolis.  [SIGH]
L:  Wow!
R:  Yeah, I used to live out in y- your neck of the woods.  [SIGH]
L:  Did you?  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I lived in Port Townsend for four years, and --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Okay, I'm very familiar with Port Townsend.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  Um, a- are we talking about corporate [SIGH] [NOISE] -- corporate scandals is that it?  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Sounds like it, yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [COUGH]  Oh, [SIGH] well --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that's interesting because I just finished reading about Martha Stewart.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, you did?
L:  [SIGH]  Yes.  [NOISE]
R:  What were you reading, a book, or ...?
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, it was just in the S- Seattle Times --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- today that I guess, [SIGH] ah, she has resigned as CEO and [SIGH] [NOISE] she's been indicted but, um, [SIGH] [NOISE] I doubt if she'll get jail time and so that, [SIGH] you know, I just have no use for people like that [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and so what's interesting this [NOISE] t- topic and then I [NOISE] just f- finished reading about Martha Stewart.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I agree.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I, um, [COUGH] I was listening into CNN and they were covering --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the M- Martha Stewart situation ad nauseam and --
L:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- I -- I think she probably --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- did something wrong but they pointed out some --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] something that I hadn't thought of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that in terms of the other corporate scandals that have [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- taken place in the past few y- years --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- her's is pretty minor.
L:  [NOISE]  Okay.
R:  -- in consideration and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I thought that was interesting.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean, I still believe she should be prosecuted --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- fully but --
L:  [NOISE]  Right.
R:  -- [SIGH] it -- it seems like they're, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, the media is having a heyday --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- with this, in part because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] for reason people love --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- love to hate Martha Stewart [LAUGH] so, I don't know.
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Well, see, [SIGH] ah, before I s- saw the movie and before I knew all this, [SIGH] [NOISE] --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- the few times I watched her I thought she was really neat [NOISE] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but then when I watched that movie and found out all the things she was guilty of, [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
L:  -- you know, and I just think people [NOISE] in power [SIGH] have a responsibility.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, but --
L:  [NOISE]  You know, I really do, [NOISE] whether it's politics [SIGH] [NOISE] or -- or whatever I just think they have a responsibility [SIGH] [NOISE] to -- to be e- ethical people because of all their power.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  And it seems that that's often +forgotten -- forgotten --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- at the higher level --
L:  [NOISE]  Yes.  [SIGH]
R:  -- for some reason.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I think a ... lot of people realize that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and then maybe as t- they ... become more successful --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] they forget --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or choose to forget.  I'm not sure why.  So, ...  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Well, maybe it's just, you know, human nature [SIGH] [NOISE] and human nature [SIGH] we all [SIGH] [NOISE] are drawn to [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- our own greed and our own selfishness [NOISE] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- at some level, you know?  [NOISE]
R:  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  And maybe it's just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [NOISE] [MN] human n- nature and, ah, it -- it's human nature that get greedy [SIGH] [NOISE] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and with that power you kind of have fewer and fewer [SIGH] [NOISE] people, ah, [NOISE] you know, [MN] that you have to answer to.  [SIGH]
R:  R- right.  That's true, you -- you really do.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean you kind of call the shots --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] and you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- call the shots for other people as well.  So, ...
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Yeah.  [SIGH]  It -- it --
R:  I've been reading a lot lately about, um, a string of murders that's been --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- happening over, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think, the past decade in [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a town in Mexico called Warez[?].
L:  [NOISE]  Okay.
R:  Have you heard about this?  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Have you heard about it?
L:  [NOISE]  N- n- no.  [SIGH]
R:  It's just, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- beyond the border with Texas --
L:  [NOISE]  Okay.
R:  -- where a lot of t- the [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- bigger manu- --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- American manufacturers have set up shop because they're able to e- employ --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- people [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- f- for less money and, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] a lot of these factories, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- overlook the fact that the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a lot of young girls who work there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] they will document -- or find i- illegal documents that state --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they're of age, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, I forget what the age is to work in factories --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there.  I think it's eighteen.
L:  [NOISE]  Okay.
R:  [SIGH]  So, they get these doctored [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- certificates that say they're of age.
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  Ah, the -- the manufacturers probably know that a lot of 'em aren't but t- they look the other way --
L:  [NOISE]  Right.
R:  -- because it's cheap labor.
L:  [NOISE]  Right.  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  And for some reason --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] a lot of these girls have been ... f- found murdered --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- out in the middle of ... the desert.
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, right.
R:  [SIGH]  And they're not sure if it's one person or --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- one person who was followed by copycats, or --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what the situation is but [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the problem is -- is that a lot of these --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- f- facilities --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- where these factories are aren't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- well lit at night [SIGH] and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the b- buses that pick them up to take them home --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] often don't take them --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- straight to their home.  They drop them off --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a mile or a mile and a half from their homes, so they --
L:  Okay.  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] and they're working really, really long hours getting off in the wee hours of the morning --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and then having to walk --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- in the dark --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- [SIGH] to their home.  So, they're --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] they're becoming [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- larger targets [SIGH] and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, these are goods --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that you and I have in our home and that we buy.
L:  [NOISE]  Exactly.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [MN] And it's -- it's really upsetting to me [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but I notice that I'm not exactly, um, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- changing my buying habits as a result.
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  I went -- but I went to, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a community meeting here about it.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  They showed a documentary that was made [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]  Okay.
R:  -- about these killings [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and somebody raised the question of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what can we do?
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.
R:  Can we, like, s- stop buying certain goods --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- have a -- a boycott.  And the answer was that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it -- it involves all companies --
L:  Yes.  [SIGH]
R:  -- that make things [SIGH] so you'd virtually have to stop [LAUGH] buying everything.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, that -- [SIGH] yes.
R:  So, um, --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] but it -- it's really disturbing to me to know that.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It -- my purchasing habits, you know, us Americans wanting to have lower price goods --
L:  [NOISE]  Yes.  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] is leading to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in -- in a very round about way to this --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- situation and I think --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- something needs to be done.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I [SIGH] wrote to m- my --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- senator about it but --
L:  [NOISE]  Okay.
R:  -- I don't know what's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- going to happen.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  This has been going on for --
L:  [NOISE]  Right.
R:  -- nearly a decade.  So, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [MN]  I don't know.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Everything comes with a price, you know?  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Every single thing.  And, [SIGH] I was talking to a friend and like every civilization [SIGH] has been made great on slave labor [SIGH] [NOISE] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and taking advantage of [SIGH] [NOISE] -- of lower class people, you know?  [NOISE]
R:  I know.  It really has.  [NOISE]
L:  Every -- every [SIGH] every class, [NOISE] [SIGH] I mean ever c- civilization has had a l- lower class that has made that civilization great.  [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  And [NOISE] [SIGH] my friend and I were just thinking the only thing we can r- [LAUGH] really do [SIGH] [NOISE] is try to be the best people we can be.  [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE]  You know, [SIGH] and, um, I think they're right because you're right, [SIGH] [NOISE] you'd have to quit buying --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [NOISE] because I think [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] every [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] -- everything we have [SIGH] at some level [NOISE] [SIGH] was made through slave labor or, [SIGH] you know, people w- working for, ah, twenty five cents a d- day.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH]  Sadly.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  But --
L:  [NOISE]  And, um, I just think [SIGH] my friend was right that we can just -- the only answer is we can be -- we can only be the best people we can be.
R:  Right.  [NOISE]
L:  And -- and [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] I don't know what else can -- I -- well, I can d- do [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but [SIGH] I [NOISE] --
R:  Well, you know, I don't know a lot about this topic --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but I know that the NAFTA rules --
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  -- play into all of this and I really --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] haven't read much about NAFTA, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] um, not [MN] enough to speak --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to it by any means --
L:  [NOISE]  Right.
R:  -- but I think, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, [MN] [SIGH] I think if more people became educated about that and --
L:  [NOISE]  Yes.
R:  -- contacted their elected officials that that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- might h- have some effect --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but [SIGH] I don't know.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH] I was encouraged to see, ah, when I lived in Port Townsend --
L:  [NOISE]  Okay.
R:  -- [SIGH] it was during the -- the World Trade Organization --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- summit in Seattle --
L:  [NOISE]  Right.
R:  -- and the riots that happened.  [SIGH]  Not --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that I -- I wasn't e- encouraged --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to see the riots per se --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but it seemed [SIGH] after that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- especially out west --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there was a large, [SIGH] ah, movement along -- among the populace to become better educated about --
L:  Good.  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] consumerism issues and global issues --
L:  Good.  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I was really encouraged --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to see that and I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] it's not as prevalent in the midwest here but I know out west --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that it's still going strong among, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, among a lot of groups who may not get m- media attention but they're still working and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] educating people and I think that's pretty cool --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- really.  [LIPSMACK]  So, ...
L:  [SIGH]  And I -- [SIGH] and t- that's a very good point [NOISE] [SIGH] I think [SIGH] I'm trying to get myself better ... educated so at least [SIGH] [COUGH] [NOISE] where I'm able I don't [NOISE] ... have to [SIGH] add to the problem.  [SIGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, like I -- I [NOISE] -- there are [SIGH] -- are certain companies [SIGH] like, um, Starbucks.  I have friends who [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [NOISE] totally won't buy from Starbucks.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, really?  Why?  [SIGH]
L:  Um, [NOISE] [SIGH] because I guess -- again, h- how workers are treated and, --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- [NOISE] um, but --
R:  I didn't know that.
L:  -- [NOISE] [SIGH] --
R:  Huh!
L:  -- ah, and like -- like I say th- -- there are a lot of things I don't know about companies and a lot of [NOISE] [SIGH] t- things I'm -- you know, [NOISE] I guess it's the [SIGH] you know, ah, [NOISE] +sinning out of -- sinning out of ignorance, you know.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  Doing something wrong and you don't know any better.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Huh!
L:  But [SIGH] [NOISE] I think --
R:  But I know, um, there was this, ah, b- brand of products called the Fair -- that comes under --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- something called the -- the F- Fair Trade Act --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- which is not a legislative movement.
L:  Okay.  [NOISE]
R:  It's -- I think it's based in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- California --
L:  [SIGH]  Okay.  [NOISE]
R:  -- and it helps, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, g- growers --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in foreign countries --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- eliminate the middleman --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and [SIGH] --
L:  Oh!  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- it usually deals with tea and coffee and hot chocolates --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Okay.
R:  -- [SIGH] and Starbucks does sell one --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- F- Fair Trade Act coffee.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  They have a specific --
L:  [NOISE]  Oh!
R:  -- Fair Trade Act logo --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for all products so that if you go --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- into any store that sells these things --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] you can look at --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- you can recognize it by the label.
L:  [NOISE]  Okay.  [SIGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK]  So, Starbucks --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean [LAUGH] is making a s- small effort, I guess.
L:  [SIGH]  Right.  [NOISE]
R:  But I was r- really encouraged to hear about this Fair Trade Act.  I -- I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- learned of it on, um, public television, I think it was PBS we- went to Guatemala --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and the interviewed a lot of coffee farmers down there who --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] some of them are getting seven cents a pound for their --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- coffee beans.
L:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]  Okay.
R:  Seven cents!  And we're paying [SIGH] I just paid e- eleven dollars and fifty cents --
L:  [NOISE]  [COUGH]
R:  -- fifteen cents for a pound at Starbucks --
L:  [NOISE]  I'm [COUGH] --
R:  [SIGH]  So, --
L:  -- [NOISE] I'm not surprised, you know?
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, I guess in the coffee business it's unique from other products in that they're so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- many middlemen with coffee [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]  Yes.  [SIGH]
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] that that's why c- coffee is so expensive.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's not as if any one person is getting a huge profit.
L:  [NOISE]  Right.  [SIGH]
R:  There's just the grower, [SIGH] the broker, the roaster --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the seller, the manufacturer, the wholesaler, the retailer --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and they all get a little bit of the coffee [SIGH] --
L:  Okay.  [NOISE]
R:  -- profit.  But this Fair Trade Act --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- guarantees they get a dollar twenty six a pound --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- the grower.
L:  [NOISE]  All right.  [SIGH]
R:  So, you can look that up on line and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there's a whole website for it.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's pretty cool.  [LIPSMACK]  So, I'm going to try --
L:  [NOISE]  That is so -- 'cause I did not know about that and that is so --
