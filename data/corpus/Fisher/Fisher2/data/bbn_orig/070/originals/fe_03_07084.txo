L:  [MN]
R:  [NOISE]  Hello, my name is Sally.  [NOISE]
L:  Hi, my name is Desmond.  What is your name?  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  My name is Sally.  [SIGH]
L:  Valley?
R:  Yes.  [SIGH]
L:  How do you spell that?  [SIGH]
R:  S.A.L.L.Y.
L:  S.A.L.L.Y.?
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  Sally?  [SIGH]
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, that's new.  I've never heard that before.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [COUGH]  Is it an abbreviation or ...?  [SIGH]
R:  No, it's quite popular overseas, like, in Australia and Britain --
L:  [NOISE]  Oh!
R:  -- but not too popular here in ... the United --
L:  Oh! --
R:  States.
L:  -- Sally?  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  Yes, how about that?  Well, I myself am from [SIGH] South America.  I'm from Guyana.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Oh, cool!  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, where are you from?  [SIGH]
R:  Um, Canada originally.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, I lived in Toronto myself [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- [SIGH] for a -- for a few years.  Yes, ah, ten years ago.  [SIGH]
R:  [MN]  Neat.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Anyway, they wanted to talk about family  What is your, um, [LIPSMACK] what is your perception of the family?  [SIGH]
R:  Um, [COUGH] well --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- my version -- my ... definition [NOISE] of family would be [SIGH] of course, my r- relatives, my blood.  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] but also a lot of my friends.  And I am -- I have a blended family, so I have half brothers and step --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- brothers and adopted brothers --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- so to me I just call them all [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]  Family.
R:  -- brothers.  [SIGH]
L:  Right.  Right.  Yeah, well I agree with you --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- [SIGH] to a large extent.  The family, of course, by definition would be, [SIGH] you know, husband, wife and children but --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- certainly it's not limited to that.  [SIGH]  It certainly can include [SIGH] members of, um, a group that [SIGH] h- happen to agree on -- on -- on certain issues.  [SIGH]  And with a -- I would say if they had [SIGH] a -- a -- a focus or a particular goal in mind [SIGH] and, ah, y- you can say that they are, [SIGH] ah, familial in the sense that they are working together [SIGH] as a group.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  So, a family I guess [SIGH] would -- would not only, um, [NOISE] [MN] refer to people who knew each other --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but may be a group that is bonded by some [SIGH] higher, ah, maybe some higher purpose, some -- [SIGH] some larger cause.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]  Well, ah, --
L:  You know, I think, ah, the church -- church family, you know, --
R:  Ye- --
L:  -- [SIGH] ah, the -- these are people who are not related [SIGH] as such by blood but certainly by faith, you know.  So, [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- um, [COUGH] [MN] but I -- I -- I subscribe as you do to the [SIGH] principle of the family as I have grown up.  I had [SIGH] mother and father and [SIGH] six brothers and sisters and --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] and an extended family on both sides.  Ah, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, my -- my [NOISE] -- my mother had [SIGH] six brothers and sisters so I have lots of cousins and [SIGH] my father had, um, three brothers and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- sisters and [SIGH] so I have cousins on both sides.  So, the family is [SIGH] quite large and extended.  We don't, [LAUGH] of course, see each other a- as --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- much as we should --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and so the [SIGH] -- the  -- the practical aspect of family life is not [SIGH] um, is probably no longer, ah, what it used to be when we were children growing up in a home.  [MN]  [SIGH]  So, we do recognize the extended family [LAUGH] but it's a -- [SIGH] it's a sort of a dislocated --
R:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [LAUGH] family.  I don't know whether you -- all your family members are in Tor- -- in Canada with you.  What part of Canada are you in?  [NOISE]
R:  Mm, [MN] [NOISE] well, I -- my family's -- most of them are in Canada [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- but they're spread across the nation.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And then I live in the States.
L:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
R:  I've got a number of cousins and then my brothers [COUGH] all live throughout the States.  So I see 'em --
L:  Yeah, where are you calling from?  [SIGH]
R:  Minneapolis.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, you're in Minneapolis, okay.  [SIGH]  Yes, uh-huh.
R:  So, yeah [inaudible] and then I've had family living in Australia and England.
L:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
R:  So, they've been --
L:  Yes, well, I'm like you.  I have relatives --
R:  [NOISE]  Yes.  [NOISE]
L:  -- in South America, I have relatives in Canada --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- where I lived [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I have +relatives --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in the Caribbean, in the islands [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- and, um, I [MN] have r- relatives, of course, s- spread across this country on the west coast and down south.  [SIGH]  So, ah, we are -- we are [NOISE] far and wide.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But we still, you know, we still, you know, respect --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- each other, [SIGH] ah, as members of the family, even though [SIGH] some of my -- my cousins I, um, I should say my second cousins -- would be the children of my [MN] cousins I have never met.  [SIGH]  Because --
R:  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]
L:  -- they have, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, these children were born, [SIGH] um, you know, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- after we, sort of, went our separate ways.  And --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- [SIGH] so the children are born and you [LAUGH] hear about them and you --
R:  Yes.  [SIGH]
L:  -- know that they e- [LAUGH] exist but you haven't seen them.  [SIGH]
R:  I know.
L:  So, you know, the --
R:  A lot of my family I've never seen.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, you --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- the only way to -- of course, to [SIGH] r- remedy that would be to have some massive +family reunion [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- which I've been --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- thinking of doing as a, you know, as a [NOISE] -- as a very practical and [SIGH] -- and maybe even t- therapeutic thing, you know.  Because I think once -- when the family gets together it [SIGH] -- it helps you to remind that you're not alone, you know?
R:  Uh-hum.  Yep.
L:  Yeah, and so I think that's a very, very good thing.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK]  [SIGH]  Yes, I, um, [SIGH] my -- my p- parents are still alive for which I'm thankful.  How about yours?  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Um, [COUGH] my mother is.  My father passed away a long time ago.  [SIGH]
L:  Yes.  Yes.  [SIGH]
R:  And then my mom remarried and that's how -- my m- mom and I came down to the States.  [SIGH]
L:  [COUGH]  I see.  Yes.  [SIGH]
R:  Yep.
L:  [SIGH]  Um, are you native, ah, Canadian?  [SIGH]
R:  Yep, [COUGH] from Canada, --
L:  Uh-huh. [SIGH]
R:  -- born and bred.
L:  Pardon?  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, +born, ah, born and raised in Canada till I was about ten [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
R:  -- and then I've lived -- I've gone back and forth ever since then.  So, [MN] sometimes --
L:  Right.
R:  -- lived in the States, sometimes Canada.  [SIGH]
L:  Right.  Right.  [SIGH]  Uh-huh, but what, ah, -- what I was asking, are you native Canadian?  [SIGH]
R:  [COUGH]  Oh, a Scottish background too, so --
L:  A Scottish background.  I see --
R:  Mm.  Yeah.
L:  -- yes, uh-huh.  [SIGH]  [MN]  Well, my family -- my fa- -- on my father's side, [SIGH] um, my grandparent -- my grandfather was from Brazil [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
L:  -- and, um, [LIPSMACK] and ... h- his wife, which was my grandmother, was from Surinam, [SIGH] which is --
R:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
L:  -- which is formerly Dutch Guyana.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK]  And on my mother's side, of course, my father, my grandfather [SIGH] was -- was, ah, Afro Guyanese and [SIGH] -- and, my m- mother was, [SIGH] um, Jewish and something.  I'm not [LAUGH] [NOISE] quite sure --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- she looks a little bit Chinese.  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, okay.  [SIGH]
L:  But I just know that she was half Jewish from her --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- name.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, ah, so our family has [SIGH] quite a -- quite a range of, ah, ethnic, um, [MN] [SIGH] ah, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ethnicity, you know, so we don't, ah, look like [LAUGH] --
R:  Mm.  [LIPSMACK]  Oh, --
L:  -- anybody else.  [SIGH]
R:  -- that's real interesting.  [SIGH]
L:  Yes.  And as you said, um, [LIPSMACK] your -- your family's Scottish, uh-huh?  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  Scottish, right.  From the Highlands, is that --
R:  Yep.  Mm, and they --
L:  -- I'm not even sure --
R:  -- left during the Highland clearance, pretty well [SIGH] --
L:  I see, ah, that would be --
R:  -- and came over.  [SIGH]
L:  -- in the eighteen hundreds then.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.  Yep, --
L:  I see.  I'm not familiar --
R:  -- to New York [SIGH] --
L:  -- with that.  [SIGH]
R:  -- and then up to Canada.  [SIGH]
L:  I see.  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  Was that -- that was before or after the Irish?  [SIGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  I know the Irish moved to New York [NOISE] in the mid eighteen --
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- hundreds but [SIGH] didn't know for su- --
R:  I don't know the exact years.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]
R:  I'm not sure if it was before or after.  [SIGH]
L:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  [SIGH]  So, do you have, ah, family members living with you [SIGH] right now --
R:  [MN]  I --
L:  -- in Minneapolis or are you by yourself or you're alone, um, [MN] single?  [SIGH]
R:  I ... actually am living with my mom again.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, I see.  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
R:  I came -- I was living out west and I came back to visit her [SIGH] and --
L:  Yes.  [SIGH]
R:  -- got a job with the airlines and I haven't left.  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, wonderful.  Yes, yes.  [SIGH]
R:  So, -- yep, but it's been --
L:  Well that's --
R:  -- neat.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]  Oh, that -- that,, ah, that happens quite a bit.  I --
R:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
L:  -- my parents of course are [SIGH] -- are, um, [MN] you know, they have been ... on their own --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for a long time since most of the children --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- left.  [NOISE]  I still have one brother [SIGH] who is [COUGH] at home in ... [MN] Guyana in South America [SIGH] but everybody else is scattered, so we don't [SIGH] see them as often as we ... would like to.
R:  Mm.  [NOISE]
L:  We do talk on the phone quite a bit.  [LIPSMACK]  But, um, I'm hoping --
R:  Thank goodness for phones and for Internet.  That has helped so much for keeping everybody together too.  [SIGH]
L:  R- right, of course.  Yes, yes, --
R:  And --
L:  -- yes, yes, [SIGH] yes, because it really is an, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, [MN] -- it's a major effort [SIGH] you have to, you know, if you ca- can easily g- get --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- so busy that you -- you know, you forget the importance of keeping in touch you know, and [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- people w- who are alone [COUGH] and are not working are more aware [SIGH] of y- your, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, of your [NOISE] calls and w- when you don't [LAUGH] c- call [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-hum.  That's --
L:  -- than if you're busy all the time.  [SIGH]  Do you travel --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a lot as a result of the --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- your job with the airline?  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, I do.  It's -- it's --
L:  [SIGH]  Well, that's wonderful --
R:  wonderful.  Yeah.
L:  -- that's one of the b- big advantages.  Right?  [SIGH]
R:  It is.
L:  That you --
R:  And I've been able to get back to see my grandma in Canada [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- quite a bit because of it.  So, --
L:  Right.  [SIGH]
R:  -- it's great.  [SIGH]
L:  Have you been able to make any --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Australian t- trips as a result of your --
R:  Yes, I actually go over --
L:  -- attachment to the airline?  [SIGH]
R:  -- every year.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, [MN] my --
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- that is terrific.  [SIGH]
R:  Yep.
L:  [MN]  That is terrific.  [NOISE]  Yes, I [SIGH] -- I --
R:  And yourself do you get back often?
L:  No, I [LAUGH] don't.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh!  [NOISE]
L:  E- every three or four years [NOISE] you know, --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- which is really not good enough.  [SIGH]  But we have, um, five of us over here --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- so we try and take turns.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Oh, cool.  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  Yes, I did have one sister who passed away.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh!  [NOISE]
L:  Um, j- just two years ago.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And she was the last -- oh, yes she was -- no, she wasn't the last one home.  She [SIGH] went home just before she died but then --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- since then one sister did go home.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LIPSMACK]  So, it's my turn.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  So, I am planning hope -- ho- hopefully I can go this summer.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yes, I wish I had, ah, -- [SIGH] well there was an -- an airline job that was open [NOISE] [MN] oh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [MN] just after [NOISE] the [SIGH] Nine Eleven crisis and --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- [MN] I -- I thought of applying for it but for some reason I decided not to.  [MN]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And I live here in Pennsylvania and --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- it's very c- cold of course, Min- Minneapolis --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- is much c- [LAUGH] colder.  [SIGH]
R:  Yes, I know.
L:  And, um, it [MN] was more aircraft m- maintenance -- ah, job --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- you know, it was not a job in the office and [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I guess I was [SIGH] sort of, um --
