R:  Hello.  My name is Lynne Adorte[?].  I live in Las Vegas, Nevada.
L:  Hi.  I'm Benji Jones in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania [LIPSMACK] and this is my second time for doing this so I'm --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- still not [LAUGH] --
R:  This is my first.
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Last time it was the Middle East and [LAUGH] so this is a little bit less stressful I guess.
R:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
L:  Um [LAUGH] --
R:  So, how does this go?  The issue is family, right?  Anything about family?
L:  Anything.  Anything at all apparently.
R:  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Do you wanna go first or do you want me to go first?
L:  Um, b- -- if you wanna go first that'd be great. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I don't know how this is functioning but [LAUGH] w- --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- my subject, when family comes, I can talk about my family. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Why's that?
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Ah, [LAUGH] well, my family consists of my husband.  Um, we've been married, roughly, nine years.  Um, I have a eight year old boy by the name of Omar and I have a daughter, um, by the name of Natalie, who is two.
L:  Oh.  That's nice.
R:  And, um, [NOISE] we're done. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  That's the extent of our family. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I told my husband, "We're only having two and that's it". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Luckily, we got the pair. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I am done.  I tell him, "It's very easy to feed them, clothe them".  I said, "But wait 'til they go to college". [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Oh, my god.  Is that scary.
R:  So, that will be, um, what we look forward to.
L:  Ah, I've got a husband and a, um -- gosh, how old -- a five year [LAUGH] old daughter. [LAUGH] Um, and one of the other questions -- or however they phrased it was, ah, how do you define family?  So, for you, is it just, um, like that core family or ...?
R:  Well, see [LAUGH] --
L:  How do you --
R:  Well, um, for me it is my core.  I wish I could involve other people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, um, both of our grandmothers, or shall I say their grandmothers, m- -- our moms have passed-- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- away.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And our -- our fathers -- grandfathers are, what can I say, the typical, just, there figure. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Not involved. [PAUSE]
L:  I was raised by my grand- -- my grandparents and it's so weird to see them with my daughter [LAUGH] because my grandfather was so -- a- always working, you know, never mean or anything but never really --
R:  Right.  N- --
L:  -- effusive.  But with his great granddaughter, now it's, like, "Well -- well, why weren't you like that with me?" [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, he's very, very, um, good with her and very tender and very, you know, emotional and [LAUGH] -- so, are your m- -- but your, um -- your folks aren't like that with your two?
R:  My dad -- there's -- n- no.  My dad's --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- very cold.  And I -- when I grew up both of my grandparents were deceased so I guess it's --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- going on now.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [PAUSE]
L:  Well, I came from --
R:  I do say that our family +does -- does co- -- um, have pets in it. [LAUGH] They're --
L:  Yeah.  A- --
R:  -- considered part of our family. [LAUGH] They --
L:  Well, now, that was one of the -- you know, that was the question.  I mean, so -- so pets.  I mean, my grandparents have ... god, I think they have nine dogs. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  Well, you know, she's associated with the Humane Society and --
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  So, they call her up. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  Well, I never had --
L:  I --
R:  -- any pets as growing and I think that had to do a lot -- to do that my mom was an elder when she had m- -- not elder elder but a more mature type.  She had me when she was forty and I'm an only child.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I guess she didn't have the extra [LAUGH] time to have the pet stuff so I never had a dog or anything.  So, now we have a toy poodle but I tell my son, I said, "We're gonna get him but I want a small dog".  And it's, like, so hot here --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- that I tell him I feel so bad for the dog to be outside.  So, I said, "It -- it has to be -- you know, something small and something that does not shed".
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, we have a toy poodle.  We have a cockatiel. [LIPSMACK] We've had finches, lovebirds, which don't exist any more.  We've had goldfish, beta fish, um --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and right now, we have a hermit crab.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Which I love because --
L:  [LAUGH] He's low maintenance.
R:  -- he's so easy to take care of. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's what I should have gone with from the --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- very beginning and that's it. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  'Cause, you know, he says, "Oh, yes.  I'm gonna take care of them".  Yeah, right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  Oh, I just heard something.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Sound like a -- there's the cockatiel. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.  The cockatiel goes on all n- night and day long. [NOISE]
L:  Um, let me see ... gosh.  What about family?  Family, family ... [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Nobody [several inaudible words]. [NOISE] Omar, please. [NOISE] [LAUGH] Yeah.  I grew up as an only child so I didn't know what it was like to have siblings and that's when I told my husband, "My family -- I want more than one child".
L:  Mhm.
R:  But it was fine as a child when I was growing up.  My dad played with me and stuff but I said, "Now that my mom's gone, I wish I had siblings".  Said, it's, so, like -- around holidays, so depressing. [NOISE]
L:  Well, especially since the way you're describing any -- where there's not, like, this extended family to --
R:  No, there isn't.
L:  -- produce that.  So --
R:  And then he's -- my husband's from Mexico ho- -- so his, rele- -- brothers, um, that he has, are out there.  So, we don't get, like, a nice Thanksgiving family thing or Christmas. [PAUSE]
L:  Yeah.  I -- I grew up with a huge fam- -- I mean, I was the only child but since I was raised my grandparents, there were --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- six aunts and uncles.  So, there was -- I was, sort of, like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- number seven.  And now it's just me, my husband and my daughter so I really miss [LAUGH] -- I experience that but I really wish that we had that again. [LAUGH] 'Cause -- 'cause, for me, that's -- that's really --
R:  Right.  It's important.
L:  -- the definition of -- yeah.  Like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for the holidays, for the -- the s- -- continual --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- support for the --
R:  Yeah.  My --
L:  -- commiserating. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  I agree with you.  My -- my dad's not so involved that my son does not know what his name is.
L:  Oh --
R:  Yeah.  That's how often --
L:  -- no.
R:  -- he sees him.  All he'll say is, um, "Oh, you mean grand- --" um, he'll see -- and w- we talk English and Spanish so he --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- says, "You mean grandpa with the big ponsa[?]?"  Which means with a big belly.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, that's what he calls his grandpa. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's how often he sees them.
L:  That's really sad.
R:  It is.  But, um, we learn to deal with it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and go along with it, you know?
L:  And you've -- I mean, and -- and you've got the pets and you've got, you know, the -- the core family.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  Um, what about --
R:  Yeah.?
L:  M- -- what about, um ... I barely know what to talk [LAUGH] -- um, just for, like, you know, fitch- -- fill up the space but I don't know with what. [LAUGH]
R:  I didn't hear, ah -- I -- I didn't hear anything.  All I heard was the word family -- the topic was family. [LAUGH]
L:  That was -- that was really it.  It said, um, "How do you define family?"
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, you sit here.
L:  Very gen- -- like -- like I said last time, it was, what do you think about what's happening in the Middle East? [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, goodness.
L:  Oh, gee.  Well [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] We're getting to some political issues there. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Right. [LAUGH] But this is actually harder. [LAUGH]
R:  Well --
L:  The whole family thing is harder.  M- -- I just heard on the news right before the phone rang that, um, Della Reese, you know, from whatever that series was ... Touched by an Angel, is starting up this, um -- um, organization -- I can't remember what it's called -- to help as an outreach for, I guess, mainly elderly who are o- -- just lonely --
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  -- need somebody to talk to, you know?  Need -- because they don't have a family or, at least, not around.
R:  Right.  They're --
L:  And so, just a volunteer --
R:  -- forgotten.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah. [LIPSMACK] See, there's people like that and here we wish we had our grandparents.
L:  I know. [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, see that w- --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That would think that I was really involved with -- my mother took care of my grandma completely --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- 'til she died.  M- my mom died before my grandma.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, it came to the point that my -- that my mom went to go live with my gra- -- with my grandma and left my dad.  Not left him as in divorce but left him to sleep by himself.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I was really attached to my -- to my grandma. [PAUSE] I grew up with her. [PAUSE]
L:  Yeah.  My grandparents are still alive but they live in North Carolina so it's so [LAUGH] far away.  And a- -- half my relatives are on the West Coast in California or [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, really?  That's where --
L:  -- the other half are --
R:  -- we came from, California and we moved from California to here.
L:  Oh, what section?
R:  Um, we were in Boyle Heights.
L:  I have no idea. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] In LA -- the --
L:  Oh.  Oh, okay.
R:  -- bad part of LA --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- shall I say. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Okay. [PAUSE] Yeah.  They really like it out there. [PAUSE]
R:  I wouldn't go back.
L:  Well, Nevada's -- but I'm never -- really spent much time in Nevada except from, you know, like a visit every once in a while but it looks so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- beautiful.
R:  I love it here.
L:  Too hot for me [LAUGH] but it's beautiful. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] [PAUSE] H- -- [inaudible] this way.  I'm trying to avoid the kids so they don't [LAUGH] start yelling. [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  My daughter's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just about to climb on me. [LAUGH] [PAUSE] Um ... boy.  Family, family. [LAUGH] [PAUSE] Ah, what about neighbors?  I mean, d- do you consider that family or -- or ...?
R:  Um, you know w- what?  It -- it's --
L:  Well, you -- you've just moved there too recently [NOISE] so it's --
R:  Ah, well, we've been --
L:  -- different.
R:  -- out here about seven years but neighbors move in and out so much --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that e- -- you really don't have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the conta- --
