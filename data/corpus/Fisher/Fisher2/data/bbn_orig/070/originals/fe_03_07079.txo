L:  Hello.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  My name --
R:  Hi.
L:  -- is Angela.
R:  Hi.  My name's Bonny.
L:  Nice to meet you Bonny.
R:  Nice to meet you too.  So, what do you think about family? [LAUGH]
L:  Um, we're very close.  I've always grown up with a very close, tight knit family.
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  Um, I've got two --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- sisters -- three sisters and a brother --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and at holidays --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- birthdays --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just weekends in general, we've --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- typically, all got together and have --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- dinner and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- celebrate.
R:  [NOISE] Huh.
L:  And do you have a large family?
R:  [NOISE] Well, not really. [LAUGH] Um, I grew up in the air force so my family moved a lot and so I really didn't get to see my extended family very much.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, my mother is Mexican and so I really can't communicate that well with her side of the family.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, I really don't go down and see them very often 'cause they all live in Mexico.  And then, um, on my dad's side, I really don't get along with my grandma and I really don't know any of my cousins or my aunts very well 'cause we're always moving.  So, I really don't know my extended family too well.  And, I guess, my nuclear family is, like, my mom, my dad and my sister. [NOISE] And I don't really --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I guess I talk to my mom a lot.  I really don't talk to my dad --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- very much -- just occasionally.  He's, kind of, a quiet person. [NOISE] And, ah, my sister and I have, like, a really -- I don't know.  Sh- -- we're six years different [NOISE] so we're really not that close either. [NOISE] 
L:  I grew up --
R:  But --
L:  -- in the --
R:  No- --
L:  -- in the air force too. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  Oh, did you? [LAUGH]
L:  I'm an air force brat.
R:  Yeah.  Me too. [LAUGH]
L:  So, we moved -- it was difficult on the family.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But i- it was interesting.  I'm -- I'm glad --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we did it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It broadened --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- my horizons and it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- let me show my children more.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  More of the world.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  My family just never really stayed in touch or -- I guess it was, like, ten or fifteen years before my dad had seen his sister again.  So, [NOISE] we just pretty much moved everywhere and [NOISE] didn't -- I d- -- guess they n- -- I mean, my mom stays really close with her family.  She talks on the phone with them and she goes and sees them but since I've grown up a little, I really don't go and do anything like that with her. [NOISE] I really can't speak to them so, even whenever I'm there, I really don't understand them or they don't understand me so it's, kind of -- it's a language barrier between us.
L:  Uh-huh.  I --
R:  And --
L:  -- completely understand.  I work up, um -- our family --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- hosts exchange students.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And so, the first few months -- we've hosted two and the first few months with each one of them, my brain was so tired trying to communicate with my host daughters.  My children, you could tell that they were tired trying to communicate with small children.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because we eat family dinner together every night.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, we do those family activities together and with my host daughters, who are part of our family, I felt so bad for them the first [NOISE] few months because communicating -- they came with next to no English. [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.
L:  So, communicating --
R:  What country were they from?
L:  Argentina and Brazil.
R:  Oh. [NOISE] So, Portuguese, right? [LAUGH]
L:  A- -- Portuguese was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- from Brazil and they speak Castilian in Argentina.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, my children got to learn -- my oldest son got to learn a little Portuguese.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And my youngest two, um, learned a little Castilian.  Um, our first host daughter, her parent -- her mother and sister came to visit --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and her grandmother came to visit.  And her grandmother's language --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- content was, "Hello". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  That was all she could speak in English.
R:  [NOISE] Huh.
L:  So, s- -- that -- and sh- --
R:  Yeah.
L:  We had her for two weeks while my host daughter's -- was at school so my- myself and my youngest son spent all day with her matching that language barrier.
R:  Hm.
L:  It was tough. [LAUGH] But, um, when I grew up, we lived in Germany.  That was the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- first station we were posted at.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, by the time I started school, I was fluent in English, German and Turkish.
R:  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  We lived in Italy.
L:  So, I picked up languages pretty well.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  We lived in Italy and, I guess, Spanish was the first language I ever learned but then we went to Italy and the languages were so similar that I just got all confused and just gave up on 'em.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And so, [LAUGH] I came back and m- -- I was just English, English, English and I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- can understand a lot of Spanish but not really.  But now, my family just -- I don't know.  To me, like, my family consists of my husband and my daughter.  So, whenever I talk about family, that's -- that's usually who I refer to is my husband and my daughter.
L:  How old --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is your daughter?
R:  [NOISE] She's two.
L:  Two?
R:  [NOISE] Two.
L:  Oh, what a magical age.  My --
R:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  My oldest --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is twelve, my middle one is eight and my baby is five. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  So, I remember those little years. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.  She's -- I don't know.  She's at the point I'm, like, "No, I don't want you to grow up" but [LAUGH] she's going to.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And we --
L:  My --
R:  -- have decided that we don't wanna have any more.  She's gonna be the only one.
L:  Well --
R:  So --
L:  -- that'll be nice.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE] So, I'm trying to get as much out of her as I can from being a mom.  So ...
L:  Yeah.  My youngest starts school next year and it's a day I've been dreading yet waiting for.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm a stay at home mom.  That way I can --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- spend time with my -- my kids.  I can --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- be here when they get home from school.  I can be here when my husband gets home in the mornings, you know, and before he leaves for work I'm here.  So --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- him --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- going to school --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I will have nothing to do with my days. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Hm.  Yeah.  I get like that whenever she's gone.  Like, w- when she goes to m- my husband's grandma's house I s- -- "Okay, what do I do now?" [LAUGH] 'Cause m- -- they take up so much of your time you're, like, "Okay". [NOISE]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And then they leave and you're just there, "Okay.  Well, I guess I could clean but I really don't want to" or [LAUGH] -- I don't know.
L:  When I'm fortunate enough to have all three of mine gone, my husband says I go crazy.  I walk around going, "Where are my kids?  What are they doing?" [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm so used to knowing where they're at --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and what they're doing all the time.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I -- I guess that's something my mom instilled in me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Knowing where they were --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and exactly what was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- going on at all times.
R:  [NOISE] Huh. [NOISE] Yeah.  My -- I guess -- I guess another part of my family would be like -- I really don't get along with my mother in law very well but my father in law I do and he lives here. [NOISE] And, ah, my husband's grandma, she -- she watches my daughter occasionally and she's become a big part of -- of taking care of her.  She's, like, her second mother but -- I don't know.  I'm real grateful that she can watch her and it gives us a break because before we moved to where I live now, we didn't have anybody.  We didn't have anybody to watch her and we were always stuck at home and we couldn't go do the things that we would've like to and now she's there for us and it's -- it's really nice.
L:  That's wonderful.  Um, my husband's parents, um, are no longer with us.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And my -- my mother is very sick.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, she has severe back problems.  They're talking about three or four surgeries to correct them.
R:  Oh, no.
L:  Um, but she can't -- she doesn't watch --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- my kids very often.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, it's too much.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  And my father passed --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- away a few years ago and I didn't spend --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- much time with his --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- side of the family.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  On my mother's side of the family --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- everyone has got Alzheimer's so my kids can't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- go [LAUGH] there.  So, I've --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- got them all.
R:  [NOISE] So --
L:  -- all the time.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, no. [LAUGH] Well --
L:  Yeah.  It's pretty interesting.
R:  Maybe when -- maybe when they get a little bit older then you'll have a little bit more free time and ...  Well, now that your youngest one is going to school then -- I don't know.
L:  Th- the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I will definitely have some free time.  It's something I've been waiting --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for but yet --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that's my baby.  I can't have any more children so ...
R:  Oh. [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Um, that's my baby.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's -- so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that's, kind of, sad.  It's a turning point.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  He's growing up.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Next thing I know, he'll be gone.
R:  [NOISE] Huh.
L:  With my --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- oldest one, it seems like just yesterday --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- he was two. [LAUGH]
R:  Huh.
L:  And now he's twelve. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Ten years has gone by very quickly.  With just our immediate family -- my husband --
R:  Mm. [NOISE]
L:  -- um, we never saw much of his parents before they passed on.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And with my parents, we see them a lot now but it's short visits.  Any more --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because my mom, I don't wanna put too much pressure on her.
R:  Yeah.
L:  My grandparents are getting up there and have Alzheimer's.  And so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  When they go to see, um, them, I'm always my mom and they don't -- they can't figure out who the boys belong to. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  They always call me my mom's name so ...
R:  Huh.
L:  That's interesting.  I guess it's because I look so much like my mom.  Those family traits run --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so deep that my grandparents always think that I'm my mom.
R:  Hm.  Yeah.  I just moved away from my parents so th- they live seven hours away and --
