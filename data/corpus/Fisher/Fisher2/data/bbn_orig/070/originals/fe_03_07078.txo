R:  [NOISE] James Bell.
L:  Okay, my name is Richard McFadden.
R:  Oh, hi, how're you doing Richard?
L:  Good, how are you?
R:  Oh, well I don't know, I'm just sitting down.  [LAUGH] One of those rough days.
L:  Well, I guess we all have those from time to time.
R:  So, you're doing this, ah, Phillips survey as well, right?
L:  Yeah, I just thought I'd see what it was about.
R:  Yeah, that's what I wanted to do.  I wanted to see if what they say is true, so I figured w- --
L:  Well, I don't know what they said, but, ah, [LAUGH] I guess it's some sort of study or something to, um, see how people react or relate to each other, I don't know.
R:  So the to- -- the topic today is family?
L:  I think that's what the recording said, yes.
R:  Oh, okay, well -- well, okay, [LAUGH] you got me, what do you talk -- I guess, what would you talk about -- just talking about family or -- 'cause --
L:  Well, I presume, um, how it -- how it affects you and what -- what your -- what your feelings of -- of family life, family structure, what it's meant to you, what it's meant to the individual, um, I -- I -- I, ah, w- w- w- what city are you in?
R:  Me?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, I'm out of Vancouver.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm in New York so it's quite a ways away.
R:  Y- you're in New York, eh?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm in, ah, Beathy[?], Vancouver Beathy, it's about two hours north of Seattle.
L:  So, you're in the, um --
R:  I'm on the Pacific Ocean.  [LAUGH]
L:  Kind of the -- the, um, cold rainy weather --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- that we ha- -- are be ha- -- been having all spring and fall -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- ah, all spring, terrible.
R:  Well, see, I was born on the east coast as well, but I was born in Virginia, so.
L:  Oh, I see, so.
R:  So, I know what it's like out there.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, it's usually very nice here in May, but unfortunately this May and this winter have not been good at all, so we're looking forward to summer coming.  Um, but in any event I sus- -- I suspect they want us to talk about family.  Um, well I think a family -- family is very important and, um, when I say important obviously that's kind of a -- an elementary statement but, um, um, to have -- have, um -- bring up your family properly and correctly and instill values in them and so forth, i.e. children, um, it's very good for the -- their future development.
R:  That is true, except I don't have any children of my own.  Um, basically I got married and I'm a stepfather, so I have to learn how to be a parent through that means, at least -- 
L:  All right.
R:  -- for now anyway.
L:  Yeah, yeah, I --
R:  Haven't had -- I haven't had any kids yet.  I'm a young guy, I know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, ah, b- -- we're all young.  [LAUGH]
R:  Everybody -- exactly, exactly.
L:  [LAUGH] [inaudible] --
R:  That's a -- that's a good way to put it too.
L:  Yeah.  Um, [LIPSMACK] so you, um, ah, t- y- -- did your -- did your family situation take you from Virginia to Vancouver or -- 
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- or your job, or your studies, or what? 
R:  My wife.
L:  I see.
R:  She took me to Vancouver, but she took me from Iowa.
L:  Oh. 
R:  I was living in Des Moines before I lived up here.
L:  I see, the ce- center of the country.
R:  Yes, right in the mid west.
L:  The corn fields.
R:  Ah, yes, you're right.  Corn fields, that- that's impressive, because a lot of people don't get that right.  They think it's the, ah, Iowa's the corn husker state and I say, "No, that's Nebraska.  Iowa's the corn state."  And then some -- some people, they kind of confuse it for Idaho.  They call me an Iowa potato and I said, "I'm not a potato".  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's right, that's Idaho.
R:  That's Idaho.
L:  I think.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Um, well, um --
R:  But my wife brought me out of there.
L:  I see.  So, from Virginia to family situation on to the mid -- mid west where everyone is warm and hospitable and friendly and nice and conservative, right?
R:  Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's, a- as this -- where I'm at, it rains a lot, but right now it's sunny outside, so, ah, it never snows here.  Um, me and my family moved up here, oh boy, four or five years ago -- four or five years ago, so it was, when we first moved up here we didn't know what to expect, but we can tell you that humidity's not something we like too much, so we all definitely want to move.
L:  [MN]
R:  We want to move where there's normal winters, not just rain all year.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, now that's depressing to me.
R:  It -- it is depressing.  It make -- it makes it into a depressing city.  When the sun comes out everybody's going to smile, but how often is that, right?
L:  Well, ah, yeah, that's the way it's been here in New York for -- for about, ah, the last four or five weeks and that -- we had one -- we had one day and it's like a teaser and then the ne- -- then it just -- and now we have rain tonight.  It's supposed to rain for the next two days and nights and I just -- it sucks, it's [LAUGH] very depressing, huh.  I don't -- I mean I like rain once in a while 'cause you have to have it but I -- I -- it -- it's -- ah -- I don't care for that kind of -- I couldn't -- I couldn't live in London.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh that -- are you from England?
L:  No, but I said I could not live in London or England because that's kind of what their environ- -- that's what the weather's like.
R:  True, true.
L:  Over there, most of the time.
R:  Are you in the city of New York or --
L:  I am right in the smack in the center of the city, right.
R:  New York City?
L:  Right.
R:  What is it like out there?  I've only -- I've never even been to New York City.
L:  Well, you've missed something; it's great.  Actually, now is the time to come because we need tourism.  [LAUGH] Business is bad; economy is bad.  I don't know what it's like in your part of the world but, um --
R:  Hey, our dollar's going up.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, but here it's -- here it's, ah, well, you know, in general the economy and the wo- -- global situation is not very good economically wise but -- but after nine eleven it really sunk.  It was sort of going down prior to that, but --
R:  Hey, you want to know something?  The first call I got was about how the effects of nine eleven affected your life after.
L:  Oh, you've done this call business before then?
R:  Yeah, this is my second one.
L:  I see.  This is my first one, so I just --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- I just actually signed up for it and I didn't -- I -- I didn't even -- I don't know if we're talking about families, but they're recording it so, whatever.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well they have to.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, basically, ah, my family life, the way I look at it is, well [NOISE] w- what can you say, it's, ah, that's a -- that's a good question -- busy.  I'm quite -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- quite [inaudible] I guess, ah, the kids that are -- we have are all in school.  Some of them get good grades, some of them, well, average grades and, [SIGH] yeah, you know, it's -- it's just kind of hard but with today, to be honest with you, if I compare my childhood as my kids' childhoods today, it's totally different.  Um, there's a lot more --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- freedom for these kids.
L:  You mean, than when you were brought up?
R:  Than when I was brought up.
L:  In Virginia.
R:  That's right.
L:  Where in Virginia?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Ah, that was in, ah, West Virginia actually, and that was Oak Hill --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- Montgomery.
L:  I -- I -- is that near Martinsburg or -- or --
R:  I was born in Montgomery, which is outside -- right outside of Charleston.
L:  That's Charleston, West Virginia or Charleston, Virginia?
R:  Charleston, West Virginia, which is the capital of West Virginia.
L:  Yeah, I know, I know, I know.  I -- I mean I know of it 'cause I worked -- well I went -- I actually went to school in Virginia, so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- in Charlotte- -- outside of Charlottesville.
R:  Yeah, and since my -- m- my family and I moved up here we decided, you know, we gotta -- this was actually not a bad move to be honest with you.  Our life is really good.  How about yours?  Tell me a little bit about your family.
L:  Well, my -- my -- and then being in -- in -- you can't get a better place to live than New York.  I mean, you know, there's always stuff going on here, it's exciting.  It's, um, the cultural -- the cultural aspects of this city, the fast pace of everything, you know, I like it.  I like to get away, we get away, we have another -- we have another home in, um, South Georgia.  Island off the coast of South Georgia, just above Florida.
R:  Like a vacation home?
L:  Yep.  So, we go down there periodically to get away but, um -- but, New York -- New York is a -- is a vibrant place, I mean it really is.  We were sort of shocked after nine eleven -- or at nine eleven, but, um -- and it effected all of us.
R:  Well, it affected the whole country.
L:  Well, yeah, but I mean, you know, I --
R:  Especially if you're right there, that was the most --
L:  Well, my -- my --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- m- my situation was that, um, I'm in the hospitality hotel restaurant business, and so the restaurant atop the world trade center north tower, um, I was actually on my way there to have lunch there that day because my friend that -- a very good friend of mine was coming -- we went to school together -- who was in charge of everything there and of course he perished along with about ten or twelve other people that I knew very well, so it was a [inaudible] --
R:  It definitely affected you.  Yeah.
L:  Oh yeah, big time.  But, um, time heals things, I mean it -- that's never going to heal, but, um, so -- so, yeah, I was very close to that.  But I think we're coming out of it pretty well.
R:  Yeah, I'm sure that -- that didn't do too good for a lot of the family life in New York City though.  I mean, that definitely hurt a lot of people, I'm sure, especially living so close, so close --
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's, ah, and, ah, I don- -- I don't know -- I -- let's -- let's hope we're out of the woods on that terrorism thing, but I'm not so sure.
R:  No, I hate to say it but, ah, if I ever go across seas I do believe I'll be using my Canadian passport, aye.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well --
R:  I -- I -- the only reason I say that is -- is because I've -- I've traveled the world.  My wife is from, ah India, she --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- she's East Indian.
L:  I see.
R:  So, I know exactly what goes on in those middle eastern countries, because I've been there.  And I also know what's going on in Europe and Russia as well because her family lives in --
