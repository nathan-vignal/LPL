R:  Hello.
L:  Hello, this is Joe.
R:  Hi Joe.  My name is Marsha.
L:  How are you?
R:  I'm fine.  W- which city are you in?
L:  Ah, I'm just outside of Providence, Rhode Island.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm in, um, Los Angeles --
L:  Okay.
R:  Cali- California.
L:  I've spoken to someone the other night that's from Los Angeles as well.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's good.  Okay, our topic is family.
L:  Yes.
R:  What are your ideas on that? 
L:  [COUGH] Well, um, I -- I think that family is very important, um --
R:  Uh-huh, sure.
L:  -- yeah, I'm -- I'm married and I have two children --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and, ah, I come from a family of five children --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, um, when we, you know, at -- everything that we do is -- is pretty much centered around our family.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, my wife is able to stay home with our kids, they're young, they're, um, just, ah, three and a half and almost one --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- so it's nice to be able to not worry about sending them to day care or who's going to take care of them, but she's able to do that for us --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so we feel pretty lucky in that.
R:  Right.
L:  How about your family?
R:  I -- I am -- I am a single person.
L:  Okay.
R:  I don't have a nuclear family.
L:  Okay.
R:  I guess I must be a pretty lonely person, right?
L:  [LAUGH] No.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  There's as much extended family as well.
R:  What's that?
L:  There's extended family as well, whether it be by blood, or -- or, you know, friends or people you hang out with from, you know, church or whatever it might be.
R:  You're right, there are different definitions of family I guess.  Is that what you're saying?
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Well, you sound like you have a nice family, so, um, it's not a -- a strain for you to have -- is it a single in- income family, your family?
L:  It is, yes.
R:  Okay.  And is that difficult in your case, or you make out okay with just like a single -- with a single income?
L:  We make out okay.  It's -- it's not, you know, I mean, we're not wealthy by any means but we -- we have what we need, we own our own home --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, you know, we live on a budget and my wife does a very good job of, you know, keeping us on that budget and, um, you know, putting off things if we can't get 'em right away, or -- or making a goal of getting it over a certain period of time if we need to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, I mean, it -- it definitely works out and it, you know, I -- I see so -- you know, I have some friends at work who, um, are, you know, they have children as well but they do have to work and I just, you know, I [inaudible] --
R:  Both parents?
L:  Ah, both parents, yes.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, I just -- I don't know, I -- I really like that my wife is able to stay home, my -- my mum stayed home with -- with, you know what, the kids when I grew up --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, um, it was just so nice to have her there when we came home from school or when, you know, it -- she was always there for us and we knew that she'd be around if we needed her --
R:  I see.
L:  -- and I like that, you know, my wife's able to do the same thing.
R:  Yeah, so, did you -- did you make a decision to for -- to have your wife stay home mainly so that your -- your kids can have a -- her -- their mom with them, um, on a regular basis, or is it that you don't trust the child care that's available out there, or -- or both?
L:  Ah, no.  It -- it's more that we -- that we, you know, we both decided that we would rather have her take care of them --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- no, not -- not necessarily that we don't trust it, but that we just think it's more im- -- you know, like, we know exactly how we want to raise our children, so, you know, if it -- it -- you -- I mean you can trust other people to take care of them when the -- it's needed, but not to raise them exactly how you would do it yourself.
R:  Oh, oh, I -- I see --
L:  So, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Well, that's very interesting --
L:  Now, what a- --
R:  Um -- Now, i- it seems that -- to me, that, um, in this -- in this day and age that the definition of family is being expanded, um, now, I am of this opinion from stories that I see that are, um, presented on, um, TV, like on -- like news, um, like news shows, like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- network news, extended news programs or like shows like twenty twenty and, you know, you've heard of twenty twenty, have you seen twenty twenty, those news magazine --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- sh- shows?
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah, where they deal with different social issues and, um, ah, there -- there are families, based on what I see on the TV [LAUGH] -- there are families there where you have, um, t- two -- two -- two moms in the family --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or -- or two dads, they -- gay -- gay fam- -- gay families --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- two moms and two dads, um, I -- I -- I don't know how the gener- -- how the soc- society at large -- if these families are accepted, um, but, um, it's very interesting, um, it shows that, um, society -- society is, um, developing, w- -- ah, um, in the -- in the current age, um, and I find it a very in- interesting phenomenon.  I, um, you have a -- a family with two dads --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, and you -- you have a -- the kids and you -- the- there's certain difficulties, like what you're going to call -- do you call them both dad or do you call one dad and you call the other one poppy, or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- similar situation with two moms, um, and also, the kids, like, if there [COUGH] there is like a function at the school or something like that, and the kid has to go with two moms or two dads it might even be more obvious with two dads, how -- how do the kids feel?  Are they sensitive about -- about this --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or, um, how do they cope, what -- what strategies do they use to cope with the sensitive nature?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Are they -- do they try to hide it or are they openly talk to their friends about their situation?
L:  Right.
R:  Ah, it's a very, um, th- the world is not as simple as it used to be --
L:  Oh, that's -- that's definitely true.
R:  -- and, um, yeah.  So, basically I don't know how society at large looks upon these types of, um, f- families.  I wonder i- -- would they be negative, like if there was someone in their neighborhood who has that type of family, if the neighbors would be -- a- avoid those people or if they accept them and are friendly with them, or I -- you know, I don't know, in real life, how people responded to these types of families, only what I hear on -- on, um, the discussions on the TV.
L:  Right.
R:  So, what do you think of that?
L:  Well, I mean, um --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- personally I don't think that it's the -- the right life style, like, I don't think that it's, um, like, according to god's will.  You know, I think i- it's --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- um, you know, like, I believe they're living in sin --
R:  Oh, r- -- oh --
L:  -- but --
R:  -- I see.
L:  -- um, a- at the same time, like, I do -- I have a, um -- a manager at work, or he's a former manager who is, um, homosexual --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, ah, there are others I know as well and, I mean, I -- I certainly interact with them and accept them, you know, and -- and, you know, I don't deal with them any differently, although I don't --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- truly, you know, I don't believe in their life style, um.
R:  Okay, whe- whe- when you say you don't believe in it, what do you mean?
L:  Well, like, I don't think that, you know what I mean, I obviously -- I -- obviously they -- I believe that they've chosen to live that way and I believe that, like, you know, like, I believe in god and I don't -- I don't believe that he wants them to live that way, I believe it's, um -- the way they're living is living in sin.
R:  Oh.
L:  But I don't --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- like, I don't judge them for that so, I mean that like --
R:  So, you feel they're living in sin?
L:  Right.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  That's very interesting.
L:  Yeah, but, I mean, I -- but at the same time --
R:  What about -- what about the women, do you think it's the same for the women?  Do you think women who -- lesbian women who have a family, well, I don't know if you mean, well -- well, I'm -- yeah, ah, you think -- okay, yeah, let's put it this way, do you think that lesbian women who live together and have the kids too, do you feel the same way, is it both the sexes you feel that way about, that they are living in sin?
L:  Yes, yeah, both.
R:  Oh.
L:  I mean, I -- I don't think, um [COUGH] excuse me, I -- I think that they're living in sin, but at the same time I don't, um, you know, like, if they have children that they've adopted or however, you know, they've gotten the children, um, you know --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I definitely think that there's ways that they can adapt to society and -- and I don't think they should be like pushed away at -- at all or judged, um, in a bad light or, you know, like you said, the kids making fun of them or -- or whatever --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but, um, at the same time I don't believe what they're -- the way they're living is the way that it was intended f- -- to live, you know I believe it -- it should be a, you know, a man and a woman --
