L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  Um -- 
R:  I'm Becky.
L:  Hi Becky.  I'm Donna.
R:  Hi Donna.
L:  How are you?
R:  Just fine.  Computers -- 
L:  So, it -- 
R:  -- in education.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Computers in education.  Gee, ah, they started off with education then they added the computer part.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, gosh, I don't know.  The first thing that comes to my mind is I -- I actually work at a middle school, um, and I know that they're kind of getting towards doing a lot of programs with kids that are kind of at risk.
R:  Right.
L:  Where they'll put 'em on the computer and they'll have them work through math +practise or English +practise with the computer and as they pass levels, well they can move up.  And they move up, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  I'm not real sure that I think that's real effective.  Maybe it's a good practice, but I -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- don't know that I really feel that it's something that you can measure what they're learning.
R:  Right.  Well, you know, I'm in education too.  I'm at the high school level.
L:  Oh, are you?
R:  And, ah, I've seen the -- you know, the -- the Play dough programs and the Nova net and all those and I -- you know, I -- I understand that for at risk kids, they can get credit that way and that's a good thing.  But, I don't think they're -- there's -- if there's no connection with the teacher I don't think there's much transfer.
L:  I don't either.  I think they -- 
R:  Y- -- 
L:  -- can go in there and they can just go -- well, what we have is A. plus at my school.  I don't know if you're -- 
R:  Ah -- 
L:  -- familiar with that.
R:  No.
L:  And if they get it wrong they can just go back through the same practice again -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- [LAUGH] until they get it right and then -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- move up a level.
R:  Right.  And I've worked with kids in the same way and they -- they're working with this -- with an algebra program and I don't teach algebra so I don't really know how it works but I've talked to them about it and they -- they -- they don't like it when they don't get to use the computers.  And I said, "Why do you like the com- --" and they said, "Well, 'cause we can finally guess it right".  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, but I think, you know, aside fr- -- I think as hard as -- I mean, obviously computers are going to be a part of education.
L:  Yeah, I'm not -- 
R:  Ah, and -- 
L:  -- completely against it.
R:  -- and -- and we have -- those kids have to learn how to use the computer.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- but I think the biggest -- perhaps the biggest drawback right now is that the teachers have to learn how to use the computers.
L:  True.
R:  And, ah -- 
L:  That's true.
R:  And know -- 
L:  I just -- 
R:  -- how you can use it effectively in your classroom to support your learning, um, you know, where it's not -- it doesn't have to be an end in itself but just a way that it can make -- not your learning, you're teaching -- it can make your teaching more effective.
L:  Right.  It can broaden -- 
R:  And -- 
L:  -- it and enhance it -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- as far as research and projects.  I think it's -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- wonderful.
R:  Right.
L:  But, as far as a teaching tool, ah, um, like my youngest daughter.  She's a second grader going into third grade.  She's a tag student and she's -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- a couple of years above her level.  I don't want to move her up in grades.  This year the teacher worked with her bunch and brought in a lot of extra things.  Next year the teacher she's going to have, there's no -- I'm just going to put her on the computer and let her work on her own -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and -- a- and just kind of move along at her own pace without any actual teaching -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I don't agree with that -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- at all.
R:  Yeah, and -- 
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  -- you know, if, ah, your daughter, who's advanced, she may be successful with that.  But, I don't think it'll be much fun.
L:  I don't think so either.
R:  And you know, it's -- if there's not a whole -- if there's not any joy in the learning, you know, I think that's pretty sad particularly when they're, you know, as young as your daughter is.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, once they -- once they get to high school, I guess, they don't expect [LAUGH] much joy.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mm.  Yes.
R:  So, it may not matter.  I have seen -- I -- we have one teacher at our school who has done wonderful things with the computer in her English class and, um, she will vide- -- well, video tape the kids doing whatever they're doing on a day and then during the passing period as that class comes in she's got the -- got it on her computer.  And I mean, I'm not familiar enough with all the different software she's using on that and so the kids are watching their -- their work from the day before as they come in.
L:  Oh.
R:  And they're real excited to get to class -- 
L:  Oh, that's -- 
R:  -- 'cause they want to see themselves on TV -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and plus I think it supplements, you know, a review.
L:  A r- -- yeah.
R:  It kind of re- -- ah, very informally and in a very non threatening way she's reviewed -- 
L:  What they've done in the day.
R:  -- what they did yesterday.
L:  It -- oh, that's wonderful -- 
R:  And yeah, before they even knew what hit 'em.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.  Well, that's -- 
R:  They've already -- 
L:  -- great.
R:  -- gone through the review and, ah, she also does, um -- she has some kind of, um -- she -- her students email an instant message, kids in -- in another state.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, and they're -- they're working on -- ah, well, they were.  The school's over for us now so, but, they were working on some kind of a joint project.  A research project and, um, so the kids communicate back and forth and I think that's very exciting, you know, for the students.
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  But, most of our teachers don't have the knowledge to do what Mary does.
L:  That's true.
R:  You know, where -- we weren't raised with the computers.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah -- and it's -- we're not as adept but I think if we could all, you know, develop those skills it would open all sorts of doors.
L:  That's -- that's true -- 
R:  But, um -- 
L:  It -- 
R:  -- you know, I'm -- ah, for me I -- I don't know how to do that much with it.
L:  No.  I don't either.
R:  No, you -- you teach in a classroom or you -- 
L:  I'm -- m- -- I'm, ah, teacher's aid.
R:  Okay.
L:  I do Title[?] One[?].  I don't know if they have that -- 
R:  Oh, yes.  Are you -- 
L:  -- where you're at.
R:  -- are you [inaudible] from Texas.
L:  I'm in Idaho.
R:  Idaho.  Well, a long way from Texas.
L:  Yes.
R:  They weren't -- I guess Title One's a national thing.  That's right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  A nat- -- Title One is na- -- federal government money we have -- 
L:  [MN] And where are you from?
R:  I'm in Texas -- 
L:  Oh, you're in Texas. 
R:  -- and that's why, when you said Title One it kind of registered.  But, that's -- that's federal money.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I work -- I'm not in the classroom right now.  I've been working with at risk kids and, ah, doing different credit retrievals.  But, I have avoided the computer programs, ah, you know as saying, "Here's your algebra --" 
L:  Well, see, that's what -- 
R:  "-- sit down".
L:  -- bothers me about the schools.  We have kids that are at risk -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they really shouldn't be passed on to the next grade.  Now, this is my first year of doing this.
R:  Right.
L:  But, I see them and they'll say to the kids, "Okay, if you can sit down at -- with this program and work your way through it then we'll pass you on to the next grade".  Well -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- they can do a lesson and I've watched over their shoulders, they get it wrong, they go back doing it.  It's a fifty, fifty chance on each -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and every question, "Well, I got it wrong last time, I'll just pick the other answer".
R:  Right.
L:  And then they just move on.  And they -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- haven't learnt a thing.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  And, um, so when -- 
R:  And -- 
L:  -- it comes to that with a computer I'm thinking, "No --" 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- no, no".  But, then what you're talking about with Mary, ah --" 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that sounds wonderful and we -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- do -- we've got a language arts teacher that does wonderful things with, um, Powerpoint and -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- I -- and my -- I myself, I don't know how to do that.  But, the things that kids do with it, it's just amazing.
R:  Oh, and you know, and the k- -- the kids can sit down and do their own research and -- and use Powerpoint.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They come up with wonderful things and that's -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- really exciting to me to see what -- what they can do with a computer.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Which is so much more than I can.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah -- 
R:  It's a -- 
L:  -- it's -- it's great -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to have that -- all the graphics and the music and just everything.  And -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- they get to be creative and they just take what they're learning, whatever the subject is and they -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- can just expand it so much.
R:  Right.  But, that's -- that's -- then, of course, with the research with our high school kids, there's always the problem with them, you know, plagiarizing off the internet --
L:   Mhm.
R:  -- and it's -- it's very difficult to [MN] -- we don't know all the places they know [LAUGH] -- 
L:  True.
R:  -- on them.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  But, isn't that true?  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] And it's -- I think it opens up a whole -- you know, a whole can of worms -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in that you have to -- to deal with and -- and then -- and then -- I think, you know, when you're talking about the computer, we've got to teach the students how to use it and how to evaluate it, you know, particularly the internet.
L:  Right.
R:  Ah, how to know -- you know, to convince them that anybody can say they're an expert on the internet but they may or may not know anything about the subject they're writing on.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, it -- at least when you're getting it from books somebody had to think enough of that person to publish the book.
L:  Right.
R:  Ah, now nobody has to approve anything -- 
L:  And yeah -- 
R:  -- and -- 
L:  -- and you don't know --  
R:  -- and they can -- 
L:  -- how true the information you're retrieving is.
R:  Yeah.  What about y- you're -- in elementary school how much computer training do the children get?  When do they start actually working?  Do they work with them from, you know, first grade on or -- 
L:  They do second grade on.  They have computers.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  About once a week they go in and -- and get to work on computers.  Now, I have got the second grade daughter and also a fifth grade daughter.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  My fifth grade daughter has done a lot.  She -- they actually have laptops for the kids -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- in her class.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they've done a lot of research papers and put Power Point's together and things.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, then it seems like they get into middle school and that portion, th- -- um, the research and things, we don't have as many computers in our middle schools.  They do -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- in the elementary.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It kind of falls away.  Then they get into high school and they get back in --
