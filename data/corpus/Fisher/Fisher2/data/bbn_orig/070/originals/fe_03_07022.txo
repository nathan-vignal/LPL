R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  I'm Janice from Rochester, New York.
L:  Hi.  My n- -- my name -- I'm Sue.  I'm from Chicago, Illinois.
R:  How do you do?
L:  [LAUGH] Well.
R:  [LAUGH] I guess we're gonna talk about family.
L:  Yeah.  And what it means to us --
R:  Y- --
L:  -- and what the m- -- what the word family means to us?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Something like that?
R:  Mhm.  Well, to me, it's very important.  Um, I believe in a sense of, ah, tradition and family and, um, th- -- a -- a -- it just means everything to me, you know?  I -- I just wouldn't be able to survive without family.  How do you feel?
L:  Um, I -- I guess the word family to me it just, sort of, immediately bring up images of -- I have my six brothers and my mom and my dad and --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- um, just -- just the fun times we've had at home and just r- -- well, like although y- -- every family has its struggles and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- concerns on issues but how -- how --
R:  You come from a big -- pardon me?
L:  Yeah.  I come from a big family. [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.  You sure do. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  And so well, you figure the more p- people there are the more problems you're gonna have -- it just, kinda, multiplies but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's worth it to have the solidarity st- -- excuse me, solidarity and --
R:  Mhm.  But I mean, are you all close?  So, that's good if you were.
L:  Age wise, we're all pretty close.  There were seven kids in ten years.  So --
R:  Wow.  That's unbelievable.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pretty cool.  What --
R:  I'm --
L:  -- kind of a family do you have?
R:  I'm extremely close -- I only have one brother but I'm --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- very close to him 'cause our mom died when I was about nine years old --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- and I had to raise him.  So, um, we had a huge -- we didn't have a g- -- any grandparents or any aunts or anyone so it was just my dad and he really didn't know how to be a mom or a dad to us, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, um, it was really difficult growing up and I, more or less, had accept the role of --
L:  Right.
R:  -- of the mother, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I raised my brother and I watched him and, of course, we're only four years' in difference but when I got married, um, and he was still in college, I mean, it was really hard for him to see me leave the house, you know?  Because he --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- was close to me.  And now he is very successful and he's out in California and --
L:  Whoa.
R:  -- we're still very close.  We're very, very close.
L:  Though -- but -- but geographically, you're so far away from each other.
R:  I know.  But you know something?
L:  Wow.
R:  We're close in mind and spirit because, um, if something's wrong --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I feel it and if there's something wrong with h- -- you know, if -- if something's wrong me, he feels it.
L:  Right.
R:  So, he's like one of my children.  I -- I mean, really, I can feel his pain.  You know, if --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- if he's not feeling well or something, I can feel it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, but -- but yet, we're only four years apart so, um, you know, I always tell everybody that when I go to California that I'm the younger one. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But anyway, it -- it's always fun to go visit him because I get spoiled and, um -- and he treats me really good and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it -- you know?  And I just like to be with him.
L:  Does he have his own fam- --
R:  He's a lot of fun.  M- --
L:  Does he have his own family now?
R:  Pardon me?  I have my --
L:  D- --
R:  -- own family.
L:  You do?
R:  I have two, um -- two boys.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I have one boy that's -- one son -- I shouldn't say a boy, ah [LAUGH] they're men now.  I have one son who's thirty --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and my other son is twenty eight and, um, you know, one lives down, ah, South Carolina and the other one lives here in Rochester.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, um, you know?
L:  You're really spread out.
R:  Yeah.  It really -- it, you know -- it, kinda, breaks my heart a little bit. [LAUGH] But, um, I take it that you are younger, naturally, than me?
L:  I am. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Are you in college or ...?
L:  I'm just -- sa- -- I'm just -- yeah.  In my last couple of years of college so --
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What're you taking up?
L:  Um, I'm studying nursing and, ah, Spanish.  Hoping to -- I've lived in Mexico for four months and I'm just, kind of, hoping I can, kind of, speaking of family just, ah -- the whole idea of family is very different in Mexico and -- and in the la- Latino  country than --
R:  [MN]
L:  Um, just recently I've started working with some elderly Hispanic people and --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- hoping --
R:  That's interesting.
L:  -- hoping to, kind of, integrate myself into their, kind of, family so --
R:  Yeah.  That's beautiful.  And hopefully they'll teach you some of their great recipes and --
L:  Ah, yes.
R:  You know?
L:  I wanna, um -- what I'm -- I wanna make tamales -- that's my goal. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, wow.  Th- that sounds awfully good to me.  I love --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- all their --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- food. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I really do.  I -- I -- I teach cooking and stuff so --
L:  Oh, you do?
R:  -- I love all that stuff.  Mhm.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yep.  I used to be a college --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- professor and I -- and I do that now for a living but I just love -- I love all the different ethnic foods there are, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's so much fun, um, to, ah -- to learn about the different cultures, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and speak their languages and stuff.  So, that's --
L:  Is --
R:  -- really nice.
L:  Is that something you did with your kids too is, like, just cooking with them and things like that or w- were you through -- how did you learn to cook?
R:  How did I learn?  Well --
L:  Mhm.  Like i- if your mom died when you were quite young --
R:  -- like I said, w- when my mom died, um, I didn't have a choice because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- my father was from --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, I mean, my father --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- was very old fashioned and, you know, you're going way back [LAUGH] before you were born.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH] But, um, you know, my dad wanted a meal on the table and being a little girl, you know, I didn't have a car, naturally -- no one could drive yet.
L:  Right.
R:  And, um, he would go out and all he would buy was, like, steaks and potatoes and I -- and I was always making, like, steak or potatoes or --
L:  Right. [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, and then little by little -- but then when I -- when I got married, I married a Jewish fella and he, ah -- his mom was a, um -- a caterer for a Jewish catering --
L:  Oh.
R:  And so she taught me a lot of different, um, meals, you know to make.  And -- and, um -- and I learned a lot from her.
L:  Mhm.
R:  She's gone now, you know?  But I mean, I learned.  I -- I taught myself, you know, more or less.  I had to.  I had no choice, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  It was hard but, um, I had no one to ask.  I mean, and I always wished that my mom was alive so I could ask her how you do something --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or -- or I wish I had --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- an aunt that I could go to and ask her or a grandmother, you know?  It was really difficult --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for me.
L:  Sounds like your family was really, very isolated.
R:  Yeah.  It -- well, my mom -- my mom had two brothers, you know, and they don't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- live in Rochester.  And my dad had some brothers but, ah, they were very distant too so it was really hard.  And then only having my brother, you know?  It -- it was just really difficult, you know?  Um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  But what makes -- what makes me feel really good is when I do go visit my brother in California, ah, he'll always say to me -- ah, he has a maid, you know?  She's from Guam.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And he'll always say to me, um, "Can --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- you make me some of your good Italian meals?"  'Cause I'm Italian, you know?
L:  Ooh.
R:  And --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so, like, I always fill up the refrigerator with things that I know how to make and it always makes me feel so good that he misses my cooking, you know?  'Cause --
L:  Right.
R:  -- we were just kids. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's like your chili's -- I'm sure when you go home to your mother she must make something that you love and you --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- go, "Oh, mom, can you make this for me?"  You know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, um, that al- -- I always get a kick out of that.  And the same with my son.  Um, when holidays we're all around and he's not with me, he'll say to me, "Oh, mom, but nobody can make turkey like you".  And that makes me feel good. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  I think it's even if you follow the exact same recipe --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's just not the same when someone else makes it.
R:  I know.  It's true.  You're right.  Y- you know?  And I'm a pastry baker.  I -- I like to bake pastries.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, everyone knows if they're having a party that I will make the pastries. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  I'm really good at doing that.  But, um --
L:  And that's good too because that's some -- some of the more difficult things too I've -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- from what I've heard.
R:  I love doing difficult.  Yup.  The -- the more difficult, the better it is for me.  It's a challenge. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, I -- I don't know.  I'm sure you must have a lot of fun now.  Do you live in the same city where your mom and dad are?  You could --
L:  I live about tw- -- about forty minutes away.
R:  Oh, that's not too bad.
L:  So, I -- I see them on the weekends.
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  Usually.
R:  So, you -- you get --
L:  So --
R:  -- to see them and everything?  That's really good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  And my brothers are usually around.  Most -- like, one of my br- -- older brothers [NOISE] has moved out -- he's a cop.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And another brother of mine likes to travel a lot. [NOISE] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, we -- we only see him once in a while.  But generally, [NOISE] there's at least four or five of us home at a time.  So --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- if we get -- if we get all -- all nine of us -- all eight of us, it's --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that's -- that's a day to take a picture because it doesn't happen very often. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Not even at Christmas time?
L:  Um, sometimes at Christmas time.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, a couple of [NOISE] -- our church has a camp that's over Christmas.
R:  Mm.
L:  And so s- --most of go to the camp.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So --
R:  Oh, my gosh.  Now, were --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- any of your brothers, um, married?
L:  No.  It's -- that's a --
R:  M- --
L:  -- kind of, unusual because they range from ages of twenty six to sixteen and no one's even dating anybody.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, my goodness.  And where do you fit in.  What -- how old are you?
L:  I'm right in the middle.  I have three older and three younger.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  So --
R:  Unbelievable.  So, you're all young?
L:  Yep.
R:  Really? [LAUGH]
L:  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  We're all -- we're all pretty young.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But --
R:  That's -- that's true.  Oh, that's wonderful though.  You know, that's really nice.  It's --
L:  Yeah.  I've really enjoyed being part of a big family 'cause --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- we've always, um -- there's always someone around and someone to do something with and someone to talk to and --
R:  Mhm.  Are you the only girl?
L:  -- someone to fight with. [LAUGH] Yeah.  I'm the only girl.
R:  Oh, my god.  You have to be so special.
L:  [LAUGH] I guess so.
R:  You know?
L:  I don't know.
R:  I was the only girl on my father's side.  Um, all his brothers had boys and I was the only granddaughter --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, that my father's mother knew, um, at the time, you know?  But she didn't live that long so I really didn't get to know her but I was the only girl on my father's side.  And, ah -- but it wasn't special.  I wasn't special or anything. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Going back then, you know?  Ah, it -- it just wasn't that way.
L:  Hm.
R:  But I -- I certainly do miss my father and my mother a -- a lot.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  As a matter of fact, today, more so than ever.  I don't know why today it should be but I find myself really, ah, thinking about them a lot and wishing that they were here with me.  You know, sometimes when you have problems --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you just wanna talk to somebody?  A- --
L:  Somebody who knows you very, very well.
R:  Mhm.  And -- and -- and will be there for you.  You know what I mean?
L:  Right.
R:  But I -- I'm happy that they left me my brother and I love him and he's like my son to me.  I -- I would just die if anything happened to him, you know?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, ah, unfortunately, I don't get to see him that often anymore because of this nine eleven thing, I'm afraid to fly.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, okay.
R:  So, I'm -- I'm being chicken [LAUGH]. But --
