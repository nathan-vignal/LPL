R:  Hello.  This is Kay.
L:  Hi.  I'm Carrie. [LAUGH]
R:  Hi Carrie.
L:  I'm fine.  How are you? [LAUGH]
R:  All right.  Kinda, dreary here today.
L:  Oh, that's how it is here too. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Huh.
R:  I'm in -- I'm in Missouri.
L:  I'm in Illinois. S- -- [LAUGH]
R:  Illinois?  Okay.  So, we're --
L:  So, we're close [LAUGH] then.
R:  We're neighbors, huh? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  Okay.
L:  And so, but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  This is the first time I've ever done this. [LAUGH]
R:  Second time for me.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, but, ah --
R:  What does family mean? [NOISE] Gosh.  I guess having somebody you can call on when you need help.
L:  Um, I was, kinda, thinking love and respect. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Which, sometimes, that don't happen. [LAUGH]
R:  That's right. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Someone you can call on when you need 'em. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  And so ...  And --
R:  I have -- I have one sister.
L:  I have one brother so --
R:  One brother? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Are sisters better than brothers? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know.
L:  Ah --
R:  Sometimes --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I guess. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh.
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah.  That's right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  My husband has five brothers so [LAUGH] --
R:  M- --
L:  he comes from a big family.
R:  My husband has -- I think there's eight brothers and five sisters in his family.
L:  Oh, my.  He comes from a bigger family. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yep.
L:  So, it is adjustment when you married? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Somewhat, I guess.  Yeah.
L:  And --
R:  And I went to school with his brother so --
L:  So, you knew him? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, there's -- his sister was a few years ahead of me so -- yeah.  I knew -- I knew his -- two of his s- siblings anyway.
L:  Yeah.  So, that was -- made it nice.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I didn't know any of his siblings. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They're all --
R:  So, it was an adjustment?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, it was, kind of, an adjustment there.  So, all of 'em were married by then and he was the baby. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You're on territory there. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And so --
R:  So, how much older is your brother than you?
L:  Um ...
R:  Or is he?
L:  Yeah.  He's older.
R:  Is he?
L:  A little over two years.
R:  Two years?  My sister's one year younger than me.
L:  And so, we're older siblings. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  That makes the difference.
R:  Mm.
L:  But, um --
R:  Yeah.  My sister, she -- she comes through when I need her.
L:  I can't say the same about brothers. [LAUGH]
R:  About your brother, uh?
L:  Ha- -- no.  You can't say that about him. [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.
L:  He was the baby and he acts like it [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I guess you could say. [LAUGH]
R:  Spoiled, huh?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm.
L:  You'd think.  I mean ... oh.  His way or no ones way, I guess.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's, ah, pretty bad. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  Babies usually are that way.
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  And when they're --
L:  And I have two boys so [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] How old are they?
L:  Um, six [NOISE] and four. [NOISE]
R:  Oh.
L:  No.  It's in there in your room.  Sorry.
R:  That's all right.
L:  Do you have any children?
R:  N- no.  I got, ah, two stepdaughters.
L:  Two stepdaughters? [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  So, we're the opposite [LAUGH] of everyone.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  And I have, ah, two nephews.
L:  Oh.  I have one niece and, ah, well, I've never -- well, one niece to my brother but then, [NOISE] my husband's got a bunch of [LAUGH] nieces and nephews.
R:  [LAUGH] Mine does too.
L:  And so, [LAUGH] it's, kinda, like --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- oh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, yeah.
R:  My, um -- my oldest -- well, my youngest nephew, I guess, is, ah, just finished his first year of, ah, Boston University.
L:  Oh, my.  So, they're older?
R:  A- -- yeah.  And then the other one is, ah, I'd say about ... what is he?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Twenty --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- nine I think he's gonna be this year.
L:  Oh, man. [LIPSMACK]
R:  Mm.
L:  But my -- see, mine just graduated from kindergarten.  That's --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- kind of, [LAUGH] depressing.  So, I -- and I keep hearing people graduating from college and high school and I'll be here before you know it and --
R:  My oldest nephew's gonna be thirty this year.
L:  Oh, man.
R:  I'm losing track. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  I guess with my husband, his oldest nephew's fifteen or sixteen, in that category.  So, there's sixteen all the way down.  Mine is the youngest -- the four year old --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- on my -- I guess, my in laws side. [LAUGH]
R:  I guess you have your hands full then, don't you?
L:  Oh, it seems like it. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  I think I'm the only mother that would ever [LAUGH] go get her hair cut with him. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I did that yes- -- I did that the other day.  I'm, like, "That'll be the last time". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] No more of this, huh?
L:  Yeah.  I want my hair to look nice. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  The woman who chop[?] it where -- they're like, "Don't want this lady coming back".
R:  Oh.
L:  And so -- but I'm close to my -- I have my aunt and uncle.  She's, like, ah, ten years older than me and --
R:  Whoa.
L:  So, h- -- we've always been closer to them and my husband's family more lives in Louisiana and Indiana.  So, that's, kinda, farther. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, is yours all -- is --
R:  Most of my relatives are, ah, in Missouri.
L:  In Missouri?
R:  I have, ah, an uncle and -- and a -- and a aunt that lives in, um, Minnesota.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I have an uncle that lives in Texas.
L:  Whoa. [LAUGH]
R:  And I think that's as far away as they are.
L:  Yeah.  That's as far --
R:  But --
L:  -- as they go.  We're --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, my mom and day live, like, only a half a mile from me so [LAUGH] -- and my grandparents and all that.  So ...
R:  My, ah -- my stepfather passed away, I think it was in ninety seven.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, my mother got remarried and then her husband passed away, I would say, probably about three years ago.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then, ah, she's -- she lives, um, gosh, I guess, maybe, two miles away from me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, that's not very far.  And then my sister lives, probably, about four or five miles away.
L:  Yeah.  S- -- my brother, probably, lives, probably, ten to fifteen miles I guess.  And my in laws live right around where he lives and -- well, my mother and father in law.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So -- then my grandparents and my aunt and uncle and all of them live close so [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  In the mile distance.
R:  I don't have any grandparents left.  I, ah -- I lost all them and my in laws -- both of my in laws are gone.
L:  Yeah.  So, that means it's probably sad at n- -- family reunions?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That part of it is.
L:  Mm.
R:  And my husband, you know -- birthdays and -- and, ah, well, their anniversary was on Christmas Day.
L:  Oh, my.  Hm.
R:  So, he takes that pretty hard too.
L:  Yeah.  And it's hard.  It's what my grandpa -- one of my grandpas passed away, I guess it'll be two ... two years this month.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, yeah.  That was the first grandparent, you know?  But my husband, he's had his grandma -- oh, his grandpop passed away within a month of his mom so it's, kinda --
R:  Mm.  That was hard. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  So, it's, kinda like, both of 'em -- well, the great gr- -- you know, his mom [NOISE] but -- but my -- got a great great grandma that'll be a hundred and four. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  [LAUGH] She'll be a hundred and four in November so --
R:  Wow.  That's amazing.
L:  Yeah.  And right before her hundred and third birthday, she had surgery -- she had broke her hip.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they told us that she would probably pass away through her surgery 'cause being so old with the going to sleep and all that.
R:  Right.
L:  But she went right through it. [LAUGH]
R:  Whoa.
L:  So --
R:  She's a strong one, huh?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's good.
L:  They always said that grandpa told her, um [LAUGH] -- like, the lord would have to knock her out. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [inaudible]
R:  That may be true. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Knock her over the head, he said.
R:  That m- may be true.
L:  Oh.
R:  Makes you wonder how -- how people, you know, can live to be that old?
L:  That's what I think.  I mean, not sounding bad or anything, I mean, she's seen a lotta kids pass away and --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- grandkids and -- oh, it -- and friends.  I wouldn't -- I mean for --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, really, you'd c- -- have to count on family but it all -- th- th- -- but you -- they're [LAUGH] like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- they're leaving ya. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And so --
R:  I, um -- my husband has an aunty that's, ah, seventy nine -- she just turned seventy nine in May and, ah, sh- -- her niece has passed away and her sisters, you know, and brothers and everybody.  I think she's got --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- two sisters left I think and a -- and a brother.  They call him baby brother 'cause he's the baby of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the family.  But all the rest of 'em are gone, you know?  And she's, like, "Well, I won't have to put anybody else away" you know?  I say, "You don't know that aunty". [LAUGH] You know?
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  You may outlive all of us, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Okay.  Go get it.
R:  No.  No.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "Lord --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- ain't gonna let me around me around that long", she said. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, go get mine. [NOISE]
R:  And, ah --
L:  [LAUGH] My six year old's [NOISE] had a rough day. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  Is he out of school now?
L:  Yes.
R:  Is he?
L:  Today was the last day of school.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And he went and -- they went on a field trip and all that fun stuff. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  So, he's wore out right?
L:  Yeah.  It wears him out. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] It wears moms [LAUGH] out too I think. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh.  I had to catch myself in the theatre [LAUGH].
R:  Mm.
L:  That's -- they went to see a movie and [NOISE] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] And so, [NOISE] um -- but they get along most of the time for brothers but --
R:  Well, that's good.
L:  They have their times.
R:  Ah, don't we all? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Exactly. [LAUGH] Oh.  But --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it does -- seems like it.
R:  Makes me curious though as to -- to your grandmother who you said a hundred and four?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, you know, how -- how did she live so long with all -- I know my grandmother, whenever she was, ah -- she lived on a farm [NOISE] and they would always render their own lard and stuff, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to make their own shortening and everything.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And that's pure cholesterol. [NOISE] You know?
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  [NOISE] So, how did they -- I mean, how -- how did they live so long?  You know?
L:  Exactly.  Yeah.  Ah [SIGH] --
R:  It's just beyond me, you know?  'Cause they never had any cholesterol pills --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, or -- or --
L:  Ah, you think because, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, today's society's more --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- not wanting to say lazy but, [LAUGH] kind a -- do you know what I'm saying?
R:  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.
L:  They had to work more.
R:  Definitely.
L:  I mean, we have so much technology more [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  I mean, they had to make their food and everything [LAUGH] --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- from scratch. [LAUGH]
R:  And my grandmother's -- well, she li- --
