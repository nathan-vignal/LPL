R:  But, ah, I think they're neat, you know.  I'm on one just about every day and I love it, you know, I'm learning more and more, f- for a while, you know, I, ah -- I was into it real good, then, you know, I sort of declined from it, you know, ah, ah, to sort of set up my family, you know, sort of thing like that and, ah --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I sort of lost track but last, let me see, I think, year before last I got back into it and I love it, you know, I wouldn't, you know -- I wouldn't trade it for the world now.

L:  -- the difference is, is that, um, with computers, you're a- able to travel not just in books now, but you can just get on the internet --
R:  Right.  Yeah, that's true.
L:  -- and go anywhere.
R:  Right.
L:  Learn anything, find any information you need, you can research, if you're sick, whatever.

L:  Is that right?
R:  Yeah, it's fun, it's neat and I love it.
L:  It's -- it's different, huh --
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  -- it's really different isn't it?
R:  Yeah, it's, you know, it's wonderful, you know, [inaudible].
L:  You know why?  Because people that aren't American think a completely different way.
R:  Really?  Yeah, that's true.
L:  Yeah, don't you think?
R:  Yeah, that's true.  Uh-huh.
L:  Don't they have a, kind of like a different set on the way that they feel and think about things?

L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, you know, it's just something to keep busy and --
L:  You mean -- do they pay you for the other studies that you do?

R:  Yes, ah, ah, for example, J- Jonathon Barron[?], he's a, ah, psychology professor there, he, ah -- he used to do studies w- -- actually, we used to do studies every Thursday, but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- now he does them every, like, once or twice a month, you know.
