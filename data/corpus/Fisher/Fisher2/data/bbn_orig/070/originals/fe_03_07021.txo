L:  Hi, I'm Jesse, I'm from --
R:  Hi.
L:  Oh, wow, I'm actually talking to someone.  Um, I'm from Wisconsin.  Where are you from?
R:  Ah, Rhode Island.
L:  Rhode Island.
R:  I'm Bob.
L:  Bob.  Hi, Bob.
R:  Hi.
L:  Okay.  So, what does family mean to you?
R:  [SIGH] What does family mean to me?  Well, I guess it means ah the reason for being [LAUGH] the reason for fun, the reason for caring, ah -- holidays wouldn't be much without family.
L:  Right.
R:  And ah it's r- -- pretty much what you ah work for and strive for and ah where the loves comes from your life.
L:  Hm.
R:  How much more, do -- do I just go on and on?
L:  I -- I don't know what we're supposed to do.  I've never done this before.
R:  We're just supposed to talk and they just record us?
L:  Yeah, I guess.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We're just -- we're just supposed to chat, huh?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Chat about family.
L:  A- -- about the -- the meaning of the topic and stuff.
R:  Mhm.  Well, it's your turn.
L:  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I guess the word family means so many different things.  Like in my opinion my friends are also my family, um, and I have a large family.  My dad -- I come from a family of seven children.  I'm the oldest um.  My dad has thirteen brothers and sisters --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- you know.  Family can be all different kinds of things, it can be friends, it can be people you work with, if you're close.  I guess it's all the --
R:  The extended family.
L:  -- the di- -- deter- -- yeah, determined by your standard, you know.  Um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I -- family has a lot of different meanings, I guess it could mean love and it could mean respect and it can also mean hard times and [SIGH] um triumph and just a bunch of different stuff.  Um I -- I don't know.  [SIGH] I -- yeah.
R:  Well, you covered a lot of ground.
L:  Kinda.
R:  Yeah.  [PAUSE] Interesting.  Because I do- -- I don't think -- I think family in -- in terms of bloodlines or in laws um [NOISE] so I guess [NOISE] although [SIGH] I guess if we go back to my college days [SIGH] my fraternity brothers were somewhat like a family because some become closer than others --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but ah -- but we acted as a group and as a whole and [NOISE] at that time and for most of the time I didn't have family around and I had them around all the time, so they probably were more family than anybody while I was there.
L:  Right.
R:  But ah but they know -- they don't cea- -- they cease to be family later on if you don't maintain contacts and things and they -- I guess that could also be true of your own blood family if you don't nurture it.  They could be family in name only, but they're not really family if you don't have ah reaction and interplay with them.
L:  Right.
R:  Because ah no- -- unfortunately some people lose their families when they have feuds and things like that.  Fortunately I never encountered that in my own family, but mine's small, it's just unfortunately now it's just my sister and I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as ah blood relatives.  Then I have cousins, but my mother and father are gone and um my sister's four hundred miles away and we get together occasionally, sometimes more often than others.  There were times when we did a lot of skiing and vacations together [SIGH] and she of course has her family in for- -- her husband has all of his siblings in the Baltimore area --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they all have children about the same age, so they do a lot of things together and any time I'm with them or do things with them I become part of their family too, which is very nice.  They've just more or less adopted me as part of the family too.
L:  Which is awesome.
R:  Yeah, it's very nice that we've -- for holidays, especially if I -- you know, I'm like part of the family if I go down there on any holiday, included in everything.  So, it's very nice.
L:  W- --
R:  We are -- we are of different religions too, Jewish and Catholic.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that can be a problem at some times, or it used to be problems years ago, but th- -- in this day and age, at least with these people, it's not a problem at all.
L:  No.  When I was growing up my parents had gotten divorced so then I had two different branches because both my mother and my father remarried --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so I have siblings on one side, siblings on the other and then extra, like step brother --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and when I was growing up my dad was in Milwaukee and I was in West Bend, which is about a forty five minute drive, and you know my family became my mom's side of the family because they were the family that was all around me, like the people that we spent the most time with.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And still to this day I do not remember most of my cousins' names on my dad's side.
R:  Because you don't see them, yeah.
L:  Right.  And like at family gatherings, um, our c- -- the cousins usually group in the aunts and uncles group and they do their own thing and my brother and I are going, "Okay, you know, wh- -- where do we fit in?" you know, it's -- it's al- -- it's family by blood but not by bond.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And sometimes that's tough.
R:  So, it's -- it's, yeah, and it becomes awkward and -- and unless see, th- -- they have to make you feel comfortable and if they don't, lo and behold you probably won't spend much time with each other because it's not a comfortable existence then when you get together.
L:  Right.  And like all of our cousins on our dad's side were raised together.  They do things outside of family functions and they were in the same schools and you know --
R:  Well, it's hu- -- it's human nature.  Of course, everybody's so busy these days that you don't have a lot of time to do it all, so you select who you're going to be and what you're going to do.
L:  Right.
R:  So, it's less likely to be doing things with people that don't do things with you either, so ...
L:  Right.
R:  Human nature.  But its' -- i- -- it's nice when you are involved with people that you don't no- -- necessarily see that often, but when they do see you then they act like you've been around forever, that's -- it's always great.
L:  Right.  And that's how it is with my mom's side of the family.
R:  Yeah.  And if the other happens you start to avoid [LAUGH] and eventually you don't do 'em at all, more or less.
L:  Right. 
R:  But you're still -- you're civil to each other and what you do is you only get together at weddings and funerals.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  And more funerals than anything, but.
L:  Right.  Um, let me think.  [SIGH] Hm.  I don't know, this is kind of a tough one because it's so broad of ah topic.
R:  Also, I think we've exceeded this so called ten minute time.  Does s- -- does somebody tell you other when or what or how?
L:  Mhm.  They click in, I guess and --
R:  [NOISE] They haven't -- they haven't told us yet, huh?
L:  [LAUGH] No.
R:  Oh.  Well --
L:  Um --
R:  [NOISE]  Mhm.
L:  Do you have any children, any ...?
R:  [NOISE] Our children are two dogs.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh. 
R:  They substitute, I guess.
L:  And they're considered family?
R:  Yeah, they are.  We -- we c- -- we actually don't have children.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] but we do have dogs that can tie you down [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  But I guess they -- k- -- they fill the voids in the house.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They get their toys spread everywhere and of course they're each spoiled pretty rotten.  If you read a -- if you read an animal book, all the behaviors you're not supposed to do, all those are our dogs.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They sit at the table, they expect some of your food --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they bring the toys to you and tell you which ones you're going to play with --
L:  Right.
R:  -- all the things they tell you you're not supposed to do [NOISE] and they tell you when they're going to eat and all the other b- -- and when they want to go and do things and [MN] --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- ah and they're -- believe me, just about everything that we do with them they say you're not supposed to because as a result you get dogs that are very ah headstrong and they become alpha dogs [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  But they're good natured.  And they're not trouble and they're not biters and ...
L:  Right.
R:  But one's a -- a shepherd husky mix and he's really a big lover boy but he -- but he scares people because of the way he looks with black, just white on his face and his chest --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because he looks mostly shepherd, people are always leery of shepherd big dogs that are enthusiastic [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.  Because they never know what's going to happen with them.  Even if they're just big babies inside, you know.
R:  Well, yeah, because they -- if it's a stranger you -- they do have a protect mode --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to some degree, they always -- they always bark up a storm.  We -- we've had UPS and Federal Ex guys throw packages at us and run like hell [LAUGH].
L:  That's the way our dogs used to be and they're just little ones with big mouths.  Mm.
R:  [NOISE] That's good, I mean it's good to have a dog in the house.  I think barking dogs keeps your house pretty safe, too.
L:  Right.
R:  Most people aren't going to mess with a few dogs inside.  And ah I -- I built them a doggy dog so they can [NOISE] we have a -- a pool that's fenced in so they can go ou- -- we live on the second level so they can go down the stairs and go round the pool when we're not there so they're not totally housebound.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, okay.  So ...
