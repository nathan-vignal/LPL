L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name's Nicole.
L:  Hi Nicole.
R:  How are you?
L:  All right.  I just -- are you there?
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  Oh, I'm sorry, okay, go ahead.  No, I've got this on the computer.  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah.
L:  Um, like, how're you doing?
R:  Okay.
L:  Okay.  I'm sorry that anybody's been, ah, picking up, answering, but I've been working two jobs and --
R:  Oh, no, this is the first time that I've done it as well, so.
L:  Okay, I've been -- I'm a little bit tired, but, ah, you know, [NOISE] go a- --
R:  [LAUGH] Okay, well the topic of the day is what family means to both of us.  So, if you want to -- do you want me to start, or --
L:  Oh, go ahead.
R:  Okay, well I'm from, ah, an extremely large Italian family, so, my family means kind of craziness.  [LAUGH] Um, there's four children in my family and each one of my father's brothers and sisters have like four to six kids, so family get togethers are, you know, really --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- really loud and really, really crazy, but we're all really, really close, which is --
L:  Mm, that's good, right.
R:  -- you know, pretty important to me.  Yeah --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so we always, ah, have --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- dinner together and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so it's important to us.  What about you?
L:  Well, I got, ah -- I got, ah -- I got, ah, seven brothers and sisters, one deceased.  I'm the oldest of eight.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And, um, I got, ah -- I guess I got, well, I can't tell you how many nephews I got, 'cause I got three in Canada, it might take ten minutes for me to tell you [LAUGH], but I mean I --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] -- I know I've got about thirty -- I've got about thirty nieces and nephews.  I got three -- I got two sons myself --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- one -- oh -- I -- really three but, you know, one -- I got one son that is really not mine biologically but he's still my son, you know what I mean?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, you know, we got it really good, like, same way like you said, my family I don't think is as big as yours 'cause I -- I -- I don't have all those n- -- well, at least, I think that each one -- each one only got four or five kids, you know [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- yeah, I -- we -- we don't have large, you know, like, I guess my family's, like, the end of the la- -- the large ones, you can't afford to really have large family no more really this time and day, well --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- well I -- well I can't, but, ah --
R:  [LAUGH] No, I, yeah, my parents struggle too.  Well, it's interesting --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- because for me, I mean, you have a family settled and I'm -- I just graduated college --
L:  Oh, okay --
R:  -- so --
L:  -- well, right.
R:  -- I haven't even looked to begin, you know, a family of my own, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you're in a completely different stage than I am --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so you've, like, started your own family where I'm -- you know, I'm still like clinging to my parents and my siblings and you've got, you know, children of your own, so, I would imagine that you rely less on your actual parents --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, now that you're a parent yourself.
L:  Right, we- well, I'm -- I'm a little -- see -- I'm older than you are, you know [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but when I first gradu- -- when I first graduated school, I'm guessing, well, I didn't graduate college to cut a long story short, I mean, that -- that was a big let -- let down because with me, of course, see I -- I got, you know, I got into the family thing a little early [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and, you know what I mean?  It -- it -- you always say you're going back but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- y- you start working --
R:  Things happen. [LAUGH]
L:  -- then things happen and then, I mean, then I start [inaudible] dealing with problems of life --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, the rent gotta be paid 'cause, you know what I mean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [inaudible] when I was going to school, I mean, I was -- I was -- I was d- -- I ain't going to say debt free but I might have had a car and a little -- you know [several inaudible words] what I'm saying is that you could work a little part time job, twenty hour a week job and -- and m- -- and kind of, like, make, kind of make ends --
R:  All right.
L:  -- s- stay with the parents -- stay with the parents, give them a few dollars, buy your own food --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and put gas in your car, you know, whatever -- whatever, they gonna help you out, w- when times got hard --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but when you go out -- when you go out on your own, then, you know, like, then, I mean once I started making babies, that was it --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know what I mean?  
R:  [MN]
L:  And that -- and, I mean, and I, ah -- I was -- I was I was, um, novel to the idea to make a long story short -- it felt good -- great being a daddy, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I didn't -- I didn't realize the price tag that came with that [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] It's a full time job, yeah.
L:  -- a- a- at that time, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- if I look at it [inaudible] and I hate to say it, [inaudible] I left school I was making, well, thirty thousand a year, seventies is pretty good in a way  --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but that was a lot of overtime.  I worked with the post office and stuff but it's -- I could have still just stayed in school, [LAUGH] and no --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- matter what, you know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Have something to fall back on.  The post office, 'cause they changed -- a lot of things changed since that -- that time, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the contractors, then they start -- they stop hiring full time, and then, you know, I even got laid off several times, I've been switched around to different installations, you know, all that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know what I mean, [inaudible] I might have put twenty years in but, I mean, I can't get no -- I can't draw the money off of that until I'm fifty five.
R:  Yeah, so obviously your family's important, it's important for you to finance them.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right, well you --
R:  Right.
L:  -- well, yeah, 'cause we -- we -- we were very poor where I was [inaudible], like I say, I'm the oldest of eight, you know, my fath- -- my mother didn't work, my father wanted to work two job- -- he worked two jobs but they still struggled, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, ah -- and that's how we were living, and at times we had eight kids, a lot of my kid -- ah, school mates and chums at home they had families of ten, twelve, even fifteen or sixteen kids.
R:  Yeah.
L:  B- but back then you could do that.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah.  Same for us, yeah, it's a little bit different now.
L:  A little bit different now, but, you know, ah, but I, I mean, I don't regret that [inaudible], I mean that was all -- everything's a learning experience, you know what I mean?
R:  Yeah, well my -- my parents had me very young, they were only fifteen and seventeen when they had me and, um, they found school to be a really, really important thing for them and they just really stressed it on me and, you know, a lot of what they go through sounds, you know, you sound like you're telling the same story, it's the constant struggle and, you know, just when you think you're getting okay and you're getting out of de- debt, like, another kid comes along [LAUGH] --
L:  Right, right, right.
R:  -- so -- so for us it was just constantly, like, ah, you know, constant togetherness is -- is really what it's about and keeping lines of communication open as well.  Like my parents, you know, always told us what was going on and always let us know, you know, what -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what they were dealing with so that we had a better understanding of what, you know, to expect from them.  You know, like if things were crazy and we were going to have to really be tight with money that month, you know, they would let us know the reasons why.  So, I think that that's really important in any family, to keep lines of communication open, no matter, you know, whether it's good times or bad times.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So.
L:  Mm, mm, right, well, I -- I -- I -- I agree with you.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  But -- but, you know, I mean, I was, like, that was, ah, ah, when I was -- when we were younger then, I would say [inaudible] family's, you know, I guess we- we're middle class, I mean, everybody's middle class, sort of, like, got a halfway decent job and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- own their -- own their own home, and we don't see each other as much, you know, we don't --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I definitely -- my sister died last year from cancer, but my -- my -- my -- my older sister now is -- was diagnosed with breast cancer, like, two weeks ago, so I was kind of, I've been, kind of, like, trying to hold on to her a little bit, you know what I mean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's -- we're still have to be there for each other, which is good, it's good to have that -- that type of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, I understand that.
R:  So, you're still close, even though that you're older now and there's -- there were --
L:  Yeah, we --
R:  -- eight of you -- are -- are you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you're still pretty close?
L:  Yeah, we still pretty close.  We get together and -- and, ah, like when we were younger we all played like Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and all them on TV.   Well, I -- I don't think Wheel of Fortune was even out, but, you know, way back then it was other games, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what I mean, but Jeopardy been on these -- on for years, like, we play -- now we play the game they call Taboo, well, it's like --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- it's like wheel -- it's like a -- yeah, actually not like -- like the twen- -- like the -- the pyramid.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Y- y- you keep describing a object, describes [several inaudible words] a word but there's certain words you can't say to do it and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that -- and -- so we -- we got that game, then we play b- -- I don't know if you've heard of Boggle, Boggle's a word game, and then we play, ah, something called, ah, ah, ah, Pictionary, you know.
R:  Good, well that gives me hope for my family then because I'm afraid, there's kind of a big age difference in us, there's four years apart so I'm always nervous that we're not going to be as close when we're older, but if eight of you can stay in touch and get together then I don't think there's anything wrong with four of us doing that.
L:  Right, right, you know, we're right actually, you know -- you're right -- you're still, I don't think it really matters how many.  I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- think that -- I really -- like, when I was younger, I was kind of like -- I felt cheated being, like, being from a big family 'cause we were, you know, we were poor and there probably wasn't -- I couldn't wear them s- -- the -- the -- the fancy stuff that some of my friends were wearing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- wore, I went to a prestigious high school --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know what I mean?  Then, I mean -- then I went to -- in college and I struggled, you now what I mean?  I didn't have th- the b- brand new -- I didn't have a car when I was, you know, in my first and second year college and all, you know what I saying?  I mean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I -- I -- none -- none -- I think all this helped me because I -- I hadn't learned the value of -- of -- of -- of stuff, it wasn't get -- wasn't easy to come by, so I appreciated it more.
R:  Exactly, exactly --
L:  Right, and -- a- --
R:  -- yeah, I understand.
L:  Right, and being -- I was raised poor now I know, it made -- it made me strive to -- to -- to -- to -- to have a life even though I never finished school -- I still decide to finish school now --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's -- it's fu- -- it's funny now you -- you bring that up, because I- I'm thinking of going -- I'm going to go to nursing school, you -- at this late age, you know what I mean, I'm --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I'm forty -- I'm forty seven years old.
R:  Yeah, well good for you.
L:  And I'm thinking about --
R:  I'm sure your family's proud of you.
L:  Yeah, and I'm thinking about really p- putting two years into that, you know what I mean?  J- just 'cause --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- because I don't -- I don't, ah -- I don't really got much, well, I can't go no further with the job that I'm in, I'm -- I'm at my highest step --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I can't get no -- I can't get no more money, and plus, I w- -- can't get no m- -- no pension --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so I could just -- you know, I could just sort of, like I say, just work with them, a-, a-, a-, ah, you know, like, well -- I ain't on light duty but, I been -- I got a time and when I -- I don't really do nothing [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so I may want to -- I may want to go to school but I want to go full time, I might --
R:  No.
L:  -- ah, maybe I might take a leave of absence --
R:  Do your --
L:  -- and go to school here and there.
R:  Do your kids support that decision?  Have you discussed it with them, or ...?
L:  Yeah, well, I told them but I kind -- [inaudible] I -- I haven't really made -- made a real big -- big thing about it, because I'm embarrassed about that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- because I -- 'cause I'm not saying it that -- that, ah, being like a -- like a -- being a woman being a [inaudible] like this -- like -- like I'm not trying to be a feminist or nothing like that, 'cause, like, I -- I really don't feel like -- like people won't understand [LAUGH] you know what I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, they wouldn't, I don't think like they kids, they don't -- you don't go to nurse [inaudible] you know what I mean?   But I worry about that, I think that --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- i- i- it's almost like I'm just going to ta- -- maybe if I do it, I'm just going to do it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm just going ahead, ain't nobody -- ain't nobody going to really even know. --
