L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  How are you?
L:  I'm fine.  How are you?
R:  Fine.  My name's Bev.
L:  I'm Hilary.
R:  Okay.
L:  Where are you --
R:  So [LAUGH] -- mm?
L:  Where are you from?
R:  I'm from Canada.
L:  Oh, wow.  Okay.  I'm from --
R:  Yeah.  Where abo- -- how about you?
L:  Austin, Texas.
R:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH] Quite a ways.
L:  Yeah.  Definitely.
R:  Mhm.  So -- so what does family mean to you?
L:  Well, um, I guess it means those that are closest to you that support you through everything and that you feel a real connection in terms of love with.  That you know you can count on 'em no matter what.
R:  M- -- yeah.  Yeah.  I'd say pretty much that describes what it means to be but it -- it also means, like, um -- it doesn't necessarily mean my blood family.
L:  No.  N- n- no.
R:  It means --
L:  That's why I didn't say blood.
R:  Yeah.  I -- it's the people I choose as my family.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Which, some of them are blood and some aren't.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  'Cause I have -- I have a lot of really close friends that I would consider family.
R:  Mhm. [LIPSMACK] Yeah.  I have a lot of, um, well, friends that I call m- -- either my brothers or my sisters --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because that's what they are even though, in a legal sense, they aren't.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?
L:  But they feel like they are. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And -- and I think part of being family is -- is being able to support them as well.
L:  Right.  Exactly.
R:  Mhm. [PAUSE] This is, kind of, a hard topic isn't it?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  It's, um [LAUGH] -- it sounds so easy when you first hear it but ...
L:  Right.
R:  When --
L:  Well, I mean, I don't think it's very easy to -- to talk about any of these topics for ten minutes straight. [LAUGH] 
R:  Y- -- [MN] I agree. [LAUGH] It does seem rather hard at times, you know?  Um --
L:  Five minutes, maybe.  I think ten minutes is stretching it a little bit. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.  I -- I read over the instructions again today for some reason and it says that, um -- that for eight minutes of the conversation to try and keep on the topic. [PAUSE] You know?  But, ah --
L:  Okay.
R:  Even eight minutes is --
L:  Difficult. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  Well, do you -- do you have a big family?
R:  I have, ah, three brothers and one sister.
L:  That's --
R:  Um --
L:  -- bigger than mine. [LAUGH]
R:  But -- mm?
L:  I said, that's bigger than mine. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  I have a brother and that's it.
R:  Oh.  Well, I -- I consider part of my blood family as family but not -- two of my brothers are -- well, if I wasn't related to them I probably wouldn't even bother with them. [LAUGH] 
L:  Wow.
R:  You know?  It just, um -- it's just we don't have that much in common.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that -- other than the fact of family, you know, like our blood family, we -- that's the only thing we really have in common.  And we don't see each other very often.  But my sister and my other brother we're -- well, we email two, three times a day and that type of thing, you know?  So, I'd say --
L:  Where do they --
R:  -- we're pretty close.  Hm?
L:  Where do they live?
R:  Well, I'm -- I live in BC and my one sister lives in Ontario and my brother lives in New Brunswick.  So, we're pretty much spread from coast to coast and ...
L:  Oh.
R:  You know, so -- how about you?  Does your brother live close?
L:  He lives in the same city[?].  He lives in Austin also.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Well, that's convenient for you.  You know --
L:  Yes.
R:  If -- if you get along that is. [LAUGH]
L:  We do.  We d- -- we didn't get along until, um, my parents actually separated and then got divorced back when I was a freshman in college.
R:  M- --
L:  And that's when we started getting along.  But we used to fight all the time up until then.
R:  Oh.  Mhm.  Well, I think that's a part of growing up together though.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  I really do think that's part of growing up because we always seem to have issues with our brothers and sisters.
L:  Mhm.
R:  M- -- but, um, you know, if we can overcome them l- -- like I say, I'm not that close to two of my brothers but, um, it's just that if -- if they weren't relatives, I would not have chosen them as friends.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because I'm not that close to them.  Um, they live a different lifestyle than I do and that's their choice.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, so ...  Do you have a lot of cousins or anything or ...?
L:  Ah, I have quite a few but -- no, I don't have that many. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I guess I -- I mean, I -- ah, not any that I'm really, really close to I guess.
R:  Mhm.  Same here.  Same here.  I know s- -- um, some people they're very close to their once removed family.  You know, like --
L:  Mm.
R:  But, um, you know, like -- well, family gatherings we see each other but we don't necessarily go out of our way to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- see each other.  So --
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  So --
L:  Well, I have my one cousin that lives in Missouri and she flies down every summer to visit and she's [NOISE] getting ready to do that in a month.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So, and that's [inaudible] --
R:  That's, kinda, nice.
L:  Yeah.  It's real nice.  And it's thanks to my grandmother because she used to fly her down all the time or fly me up to Missouri so that we could stay close.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  But, ah ... [PAUSE]
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  Well, that's nice.  I mean -- I don't know.  I think, um, in this day and age we've -- we've, kind of, um ... [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] Years ago y- -- family used to be very, very important because it was family you turned to for everything.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, and now, y- you know, we've -- we don't because -- because our families are so spread out over the countries and that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, it's just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  But I think that with email, that's made it a little better just because -- I mean, people are -- people communicate more.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  With --
R:  Yeah.  Even if it's just a quick note, "Hi.  How you doing?"  Um --
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  You know, "Everything's fine here" type thing.
L:  Right.
R:  You do tend to stay in touch a little bit more --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- than we did before the internet type thing.  Or before a lot of us got on it because I'm, um -- my one brother I would b- -- email to my sister and everything and then my brother would -- I'd have to fax him because he wouldn't get the internet [LAUGH].
L:  Mm.
R:  He'd just, "I don't -- can't be bothered" you know?  And then when he finally did break down, like, he says he doesn't know why he held out so long.
L:  Right.
R:  But, um, you know? [LIPSMACK] Just one of those things so ... [PAUSE] 
L:  Well, are your parents still alive?
R:  No.  My parents aren't alive.
L:  I'm lucky then.
R:  Um, they've been gone for a number of years.  So ...
L:  Oh.
R:  And -- and that's p- -- when we actually did start drifting apart even more.
L:  Mhm. [several inaudible words]
R:  Ah, and when my mom was finally gone. [PAUSE] She, um -- she, more or less, held us all together. [PAUSE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and that.  So ...
L:  I think parents tend to do that a lot.
R:  Yeah.  How about your parents?  Are they alive or ...?
L:  They're -- they're both still alive.
R:  Well, that's good. [PAUSE] Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  They're in -- they're both remarried.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And my step mom is great but my step dad is not. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  Mom's about to be divorced again.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.  Well, [LIPSMACK] you know, that's too bad when -- when, you know, you -- a person makes a second marriage and -- and it's not that great.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Unfortunately.  It just, um ... [LIPSMACK] I don't know what you can --
L:  Pick[?] up --
R:  -- you know -- what you can do about it type thing.
L:  This is their -- 
R:  I guess you can't.  Mm?
L:  I guess they have to -- their[?] ninth year anniversary this year.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Well, then that's not too bad.  It's not like they've just gotten together and, you know -- like, just gotten married and then they're ready to break up again.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, it's -- but, you know, it would be nice -- we a- -- we all wanna see when our parents are divorced and remarried, we want to see them, um, have a happy life.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, you know, if w- -- if we're not really happy with who they choose then -- then sometimes, ah [LIPSMACK] -- I don't know [SIGH] what I [LAUGH] -- I know what I'm trying to say just not sure how to say it. [LAUGH] Um, we sometimes, maybe, put negative feelings on what we consider the relationship to be and -- and maybe it isn't as bad as that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, like in, ah -- and just because your mom chose this guy doesn't mean you have to think he's the world's greatest anyway.  So ...
L:  Right.
R:  You know, it's --
L:  It's -- 
R:  -- ah --
L:  Different personalities.
