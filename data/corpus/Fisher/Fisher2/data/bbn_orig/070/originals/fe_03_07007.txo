L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.  My name is Pat.
L:  Hi Pat.  This is Sheila in Tennessee.
R:  I'm from Richmond, Virginia.  [COUGH] How're you doing Sheila?
L:  I'm fine.
R:  Great.  Great.  [MN] Top -- 
L:  Ah, computers in education.
R:  Yes, computers in education.  And how do --
L:  Do you -- 
R:  -- you feel?
L:  Do you have small ones?  I don't.
R:  I have an eighteen year old.
L:  Mine's twenty.
R:  Okay.  And, um, I think that computers in education have been a big help, I really do.  Um, we have, um, in Virginia -- ah, ah, the school system my son just graduated from last year, they were selected to try these, um, eye books and which each child [MN] in high school they got a laptop computer to bring home --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [MN] so they could do homework, assignments.  Everything was done, you know, [MN] with the laptop computers.  So [COUGH] it's just that technology has just gone sky high.  I -- I couldn't believe it we were, you know, selected to do it and it was just such a successful, um, you know, a little, um, thing they had going on and the kids enjoyed it and the parents.  So, what it did, it gave each child an opportunity that did not have a -- a -- a personal computer in their home --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they all had computers every day.  So, it just made everybody seem like they were on an even keel.  So -- 
L:  Right, and it gave them experience -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that they might not have ordinarily had.  Um, here, ah -- w- we're kind of a rural area and, um, I know that the grade school have 'em.  I don't think our high school, other than just a computer class -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I don't think we have any type of program like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, right now what I'm experiencing with -- with my daughter and myself is, um, computer classes for college and we're really enjoying that because -- 
R:  Y- -- 
L:  -- it's given me an opportunity to go back to school -- 
R:  Oh, wonderful.
L:  -- and further my education.  Um, I'm working on my [inaudible] degree -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and it's given me an opportunity to continue working, at the same time take classes, you know, at night in your pyjamas.
R:  Mm.  Isn't that wonderful.
L:  So -- so -- that w- -- you know, that's where I am in my life.  I don't have that much exposure to the smaller kids and what's going on. 
R:  Right.  Yeah, well, um, I am in a -- like a metropolitan area --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, on the outskirts of Richmond and you know, it -- computers are just, you know, everywhere the kids m- -- you know, in -- in just about every home, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the kids are learning at all the school systems, um, in -- on the a- -- on the el- elementary level they have computers in the classroom here --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but on, like I said, um, middle school and high school kids, they each have their own.  I mean, they put so much money into this program and they used us as a pilot, you know, to, um, to --
L:  That's -- 
R:  -- study it.
L:  -- phenomenal.
R:  And it -- it -- it w- -- it just was such an awesome -- a- -- you know, my son was like, "Oh, mom, I'm just so sorry that" -- because he was a senior the year -- the year that they did it, you know -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- so he was like, "I wish they had this" you know?  So, we did feedback from the children [MN].  I even did a -- um, some -- somewhat similar to what you and I are doing.  It was --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like an open forum for the school board and I was the parent that they had selected to, um, you know, talk about the same topics as how did I feel the eye books or the laptop computers had -- had they benefited or had they, you know, not +benefitted the kids, you know, throughout the school year.  So, um, I -- I'm an old school teacher and I can remember back when I taught school.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We didn't have computers but, you know, they were coming in and oh, I just was scared to even touch it, you know, because we are just so com- -- you know, we're not -- like, these kids that are -- that -- that are coming now to me -- 
L:  Oh, they start at such an early age now -- 
R:  I know it and it -- it -- it comes so easy for 'em.
L:  Right.  But, they have to have it.
R:  They have to -- 
L:  By the time they leave high school, if they're not exposed to it and go to college, just look at how far they're going to be behind just on -- 
R:  Mm, exactly.
L:  -- on their assignments and things.
R:  Right.  So, I think that they -- this new -- this new technology, they -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- these kids are at such a great advantage.
L:  We've just done well to get them in all of our classrooms here.
R:  Right.
L:  Not -- not the laptop.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Are you very computer literate yourself?
L:  Mm, no.
R:  Your dau- -- does -- 
L:  My daughter's wonderful and -- 
R:  Yeah, and she teaches you a lot -- 
L:  -- she -- she's kind of made fun of me.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I know, and they grow so fast with it don't they?
L:  Right.  And they just don't understand why you can't comprehend it and I said, "Because it's, ah -- it's so new to me, where you've been taught --" 
R:  Right.
L:  -- in school" and, ah, they just pick it up so much more quickly than --" 
R:  It's just like they -- they're born with a computer chip in their brain.
L:  Right.
R:  Because, I mean, not just with regular PCs, um, just like the games, the Playstation games, you know, all that kind of stuff, these kids, they just can sit down and do 'em so well and I have such great difficulty.  I -- I mean, if it's a cost, I'm not kidding, keep the car on the road, huh?  You know [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- so [LAUGH] -- it's a -- I -- I always wonder what is it that these children have and, um, ah, it has something -- t- to me it has something to do with the change of the time because, um, some of the things that they do it -- it -- it's -- it's -- w- -- ah, you know, we're just not co- coordinated to do it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I mean, ah, y- yeah, we're not co- coordinated -- 
L:  But, to be able to just pack up and take your work -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- or your schooling or wherever -- wherever you -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- go.
R:  We sit down at the computers and, um, you know, we feel -- we think we're going to break 'em or we're going to do something wrong --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I watch the kids, they go to 'em and just [MN] you know, just do their thing and -- and -- and I mean, even children that can't learn or -- or slow learners, um, they -- they do well with, um, c- -- you know, on the, um, computers and things, ah, it's just truly amazing.  It's amazing at the age that they start, ah, you know, starting the kids on computers in the school system too.  Um -- 
L:  'Cause they'll never be afraid of 'em like -- like for me -- 
R:  No --  
L:  -- and you.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yep, and, um, it's really been a blessing.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH] I -- I feel very special to be in a [MN] um, this, um, area especially as -- as the elected school system that was chosen over, um, I think it was the only fifth [several inaudible words] in the United States, I think, um, that had this.  Um, I know in Virginia -- [LAUGH] well, I won't say that but -- but I know in Virginia.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, it was, um, [MN] I think the system --
L:  And it's a pilot program.
R:  -- took great pride with it, yeah.  So, they -- you know, they had a lot of nicks and glitches in the beginning because --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [MN] the only thing these kids are so smart [MN] so I think, um, ah, they had like a situation where a child had gone in and see, the teachers had the computers too so a child was o- go -- able to go in and, um, what do --
L:  Communicate?
R:  -- they call it?  Hack it, like.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.  And they was able to steal, well, like the -- an exam then they had a lot of kids that were looking at, um, puffin- -- pornography is it? 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Mhm, um, on these computers, um, then they had -- you know, they would download music and download obscene things so we had a couple of bad situations.  But, one thing that I was happy about, the system did not pull the -- the, um, you know, they didn't pull all the computers and didn't punish all of the kids.  They made everyone aware of what was going on at this particular school and this particular school and they understood that you're going to have a few rotten apples in a bag, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  So, some kids made it, ah, you know, like, well, people will wonder well, that's what they get for giving 'em all computers.  It's just, you know, and I'm glad they didn't take the computers from the kids because it was just a few kids that, like I say, were hacking in and stealing grades and you know, um, obscene things and, um, but they -- [MN] you know, they -- they dealt with them on an individual basis and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they allowed the kids to contin- continue with the computer program the next year.  So -- 
L:  So, do you know where they're going with it from there?
R:  Y- -- 
L:  Are they going to try to expand to other, um -- 
R:  Um, what they did -- 
L:  -- to other states or to -- 
R:  -- what they did do, um, the first year it was just for high school students.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, all the high schools in -- in Rico[?] County -- we live in Richmond but on the outskirts, like suburbs so we call it eastern in Rico or in Rico County.  It's, um -- it's not Richmond public school system, it's in Rico County's public school system.  So, what they did [COUGH] after the first year they went on and let -- now they have 'em in the middle schools.  So, I don't know where they will go now.  Like I said, my son has graduated and now he is, um, a -- a -- a rising sophomore, um, at Old Dominion College.  He's an engineering student and so, you know, [MN] well, he -- he -- he did a pre engineering class when he was, um, in high school here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We had a pre engineering course he took.  So, I had to have a computer because some of the stuff they were doing, you know, they had to do work on the computer so when he went to college it was like I had to buy him a -- a computer just for his college dorm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, that's why I'm saying it -- it forces families to have 'em because the kids are growing so fast and technology is just changing so.
L:  Yeah.  We had to do that when ours went to school.
R:  Mhm.  Where's your child?
L:  A- -- she's going down to, ah -- I live in Tennessee but I'm on the Alabama line.  She's going down to University of Alabama in Huntsville.
R:  Oh.
L:  Which is northern Alabama.
R:  How far from home?
L:  It's about a -- an hour's drive.
R:  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.
L:  But, um, I've heard of Old Dominion though.
R:  You've heard of Old Dominion?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I love that school.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] My son really wanted Virginia Tech and I, you know, I just thought it was a little bit much, ah, um -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, he -- he's used to his mom helping him and being --
