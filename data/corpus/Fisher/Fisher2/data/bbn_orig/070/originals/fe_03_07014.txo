L:  [NOISE] Hi.  I'm Nancy.
R:  Nicole Ward.
L:  Oh, hi.
R:  Oops, I didn't really wanna give my last name.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, well.
L:  That's okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I probably won't remember it. [LIPSMACK]
R:  Hi.  How --
L:  How --
R:  -- are you?
L:  Good.  Um --
R:  Good.  I d- --
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  I have no idea.  They didn't -- they didn't give a topic.
L:  Oh.  She said, "Education and computers --"
R:  Okay.
L:  "-- and how ... "  Y- you wanna go ahead?
R:  Yeah.  That's fine.
L:  Okay.
R:  But what is -- what are we supposed to, ah, answer?
L:  Well, I think --
R:  Or --
L:  -- she said, um, "Do we feel that the computers in education helped or didn't help with education?"
R:  Computers --
L:  I think she said, "Computers in school" I guess.
R:  [NOISE] Okay.
L:  So, let's go with that. [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.  Ah, how c- --
L:  What do you think?
R:  How computers help with education?
L:  M- --
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] That's pretty general. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  A- and I think it could go both ways depending how it's used. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  Definitely.  Um, is it for a certain age or ...?
L:  Um, they didn't say.  I would just say that I think it's good to have because it's part of the future and you need to know how to use it.  But, um, I think as long as it's used properly. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Right.  Um, I mean, I think it would be -- I think it would be good, [SIGH] um, in terms of, you know, kids doing, ah, [LIPSMACK] research and stuff on different --
L:  Right.
R:  -- topics.  Um --
L:  It's great for research.
R:  Yeah.  I think it would be good for that and, ah, I mean, I don't -- I don't know.  I don't know, ah, what --
L:  Did you use computers in your education?
R:  Well, I did but the only thing I used was, um, [LIPSMACK] -- the only thing we actually used was, ah, w- -- ah, word processing actually --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- when I was in college.
L:  Right.
R:  But when I was in high school, we didn't -- they didn't have computers at all.
L:  Oh, you know and y- -- they can type it in for you.  All you have to do is speak it now, [LAUGH] you know?
R:  Right.
L:  So, it's so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- much different and so much easier and they get information so much quicker than we did that I think that, um, it's a whole different generation the way they're learning and the w- -- they're -- they seem to be smarter and faster --
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  -- I think, because of the computers.
R:  Right.
L:  And they've grown up w- -- ah, I think the younger +generation -- generation has grown up them so they're real comfortable with it and they understand it quicker. [NOISE]
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
L:  They understand all the symbols and icons and what to do and what to push and what the codes are and I --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I'm still trying to catch up with all that. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.  So, what do you think?  Do you think it's a good thing or d- -- I mean, do you think it's -- how do you it could be --
L:  [SIGH] Oh ...
R:  -- useful and how do you think it would be --
L:  I think --
R:  -- not useful?
L:  I think, like you said, that the research is -- it's great for research.  If you're trying to get information, um, that's a good way for them to f- find a way to do it and they learn how to, um, break it down to get the quickest information and the most information.  So, I think that's really good.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think that --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- um, it's also -- leaves the door open for a lotta things that, um, aren't educational or don't need to be part of the curriculum but it's -- it's there and I think that it's gonna tempt them no matter what.
R:  Right.  You mean, just the bad stuff?
L:  Well, yeah.  Because the i- information can be used -- people's credit histories, um, you know, starting new -- just, whatever they wanna do with it.  I think it -- with everything, there's the good and the bad.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  And depending on how it's used --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it -- we'll see how [LAUGH] it comes out.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It's -- it's -- I find the question -- I mean, I didn't even hear a question but I -- I really wish that it was more specific because I don't know what they're asking.
L:  It was pretty general.
R:  So, I feel very frus- -- I feel very frustrated.  I feel like -- like -- I mean, they didn't even say a question.  Did you hear a question?
L:  I just heard the, um, topic of, a- -- ah, computers and education.
R:  Hm.
L:  I think that's what she said. [LAUGH] I didn't get a chance to write it down -- I just walked in the door.
R:  Mm.
L:  So --
R:  Yeah.  I mean, I would, um -- I would say that it would be a -- that it would be very useful, um, in terms of, ah, writing quickly, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and being able to write, kind of, in a stream of consciousness.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, I think that would be good and it would be good for creative writing.  And, um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- also good if people can learn, you know, um, ha- -- it --
L:  On their computers.
R:  Yeah.  And also learn the creative aspects like drawing and, um --
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  There's a lot of stuff that you can do with, um --
L:  Do you use a computer for, um, creative things?
R:  -- graphics and ...  Um, I actually don't because I -- I really haven't learned.  I mostly just use it for, um, you know, like emails and typing and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, but I -- I do know, you know, that a lot of people but I don't know at what age, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it can be, ah -- it can be --
L:  And the -- the digital art now is so realistic looking it's -- it's almost scary. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Exactly.  Exactly.  But I know in terms of, um, if -- you know, if they're not monitored or if there're not blocks on certain websites that it would be -- it could be really detrimental.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  I mean, people -- you know, that's where, like, these young people get, um, drawn into, you know, um --
L:  Yeah.  Because they're bored and they're looking for something of interest and anything --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- exciting or different might appeal to them and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I think that's where it comes in where we need to offer them more than just the computers.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  There should be other things. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  There should --
L:  Not cooped up in the room with the computer twenty four hours a day.
R:  No.  No.
L:  That's not good either.
R:  Absolutely.  No.  But I mean, it -- I don't know if, ah, at the schools they're able to block, um, you know, on the internet and stuff -- if they're able to block that or not.  I --
L:  Y- -- um, I'm -- I'm sure that t- t- -- w- -- if they are they'll tr- -- probably crack that code or find a way to get around it, as usual.  Everybody's always trying to, you know -- it just seems that way.  Otherwise, how would they be progressing?  I mean, I'm not, um, [LIPSMACK] that fluent on computers anymore but it just seems like whenever something's been, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know -- developed, somebody else, kinda, breaks into it and then cracks that code and then they have to do another series of programs and -- and it just seems like it's a constant an- and it's this fast flowing, type of, information and it -- kids are figuring it out and -- and it's good because they're smart and they're figuring things out but I -- I don't know how creative it is.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  D- did that make sense? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That does.  That does.  Um, let's see -- I'm trying to think of what other things ...  I mean, it would be good, I guess, too in terms of learning about -- it would be easy to learn about foreign countries and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- geography and stuff.
L:  Right.
R:  Which, you know, I didn't have that when I was growing up and I know, um, geography is, ah -- is something that's really, um -- for Americans, it's important because we're so isolated and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it would be -- it would be very beneficial for people just to be able to put in a, you know -- a -- the name of a -- a country and then --
L:  L- learn a little more culture.  Yeah.  I agree.
R:  Yeah.  Um --
L:  And what they really have to say. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [SIGH] Um --
L:  You know?
R:  Definitely.  But I -- I mean, if -- I guess if they got into any, like x rated porn --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- sites [LAUGH] or whatever, that would probably be --
L:  Just a minute honey.
R:  -- pretty disastrous.
L:  [NOISE] Okay.
R:  Ah --
L:  Thank you.  Sorry.  My son is over here still awake.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, yeah.
R:  So, that wouldn't be a -- that wouldn't be a good thing.
L:  And I think there's other things too out there that -- besides just that, kind of, bad stuff, that they can caught up in that, um, it -- and it's --
R:  Like, what kind of things?
L:  I just think that a lot of stuff is border line with the computers because it's a n- -- it's new territory so that the laws aren't, you know, solidified.  Like, here's, you know -- this is black and white -- it's either this or that, this is right or wrong.  There's a lotta gray areas, I think, with computers where they're getting information, using it, um, to their advantage and doing whatever with it whether it's, um, marketing scams or just, um, [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] -- I don't know.  I just feel like y- -- there's a lot of that out there right now because until they've +gotten -- gotten more laws on the books, it's -- there's a lotta gray areas.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  And so, um, until it becomes either, you know, illegal or, you know, they clarify the standards, it just seems like there's a lot of people making money on the computer industry and there's a lotta other people who aren't in the know who're, kind of, spending that money, if you know what I mean?
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  Whether it's on the programs or the time or -- or the businesses, it just seems like a lot of, um, people are out there throwing out their information or their businesses and if somebody who takes it up then they'll sell it and i- -- who --
R:  Right.
L:  -- knows how long they'll be in business?  You know?
R:  Right.
L:  Or -- or if -- you know what I mean?  There's just a lot of ifs about it.
R:  Yeah.  That's a lot -- lots of scams and stuff.
L:  And even eBay.  I just -- that [SIGH] -- that one's a wonder to me that they don't have more problems than they do.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, just --
R:  You mean 'cause of the -- 'cause it's an auct[?]- --
L:  There's so much on there.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  I mean, you can find anything on there.
R:  Right.  But students don't really have, ah -- I mean, students don't really have, um, a lot of acc- -- I don't know.  I'd -- maybe more students do have access to money these days but, I mean, in terms of them getting ripped off, I don't know if -- if students have access --
L:  Or just even starting their own little, um, stores.  You c- -- you, yourself -- I, myself, could open up a store on eBay -- they have those little shops if you wanna do antiques or jewelry or something and then you're, like, a eBay store and, um, selling online basically.  And so, all you have to do really is, kinda, sell it online and get the shipment shipped out. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  And, um, I think there's a lotta different ways that kids can get into businesses.  But, like I said, it just seems so gray it -- there's such a gray area.
R:  Right.
L:  There's either the really, really rich and then there's n- no in between. [LAUGH]
R:  N- -- right.  I didn't think kids, though, were allowed to, ah -- to do that.  I mean, I didn't think kids were, um, ah -- I mean, you have to be a certain age to be able to do that kind of stuff.
L:  Like, with the business license or something for a store?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Y- you do have to be --
L:  That's what I mean that there isn't a l- -- I mean, how do they enforce it?  How do they know --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- the person on the other end is [LAUGH] twenty one or is thirty one or whatever it should be.  You know what I mean?
R:  Right.  Ready --
L:  I mean, they're typing in the correct information but is the person sitting there really them?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think there's a lot of people's identities being stolen or u- used or even if it's just --
