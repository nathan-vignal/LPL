L:  Hello.  My name's Laurie.
R:  Hi.  My name's Tamra.
L:  Nice to meet you Tamra.
R:  Nice to meet you too.
L:  Um, would you like to start? [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, that's fine.
L:  Okay.
R:  Ah, I think the topic was what does the word family mean --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- to me?  Um, in my opinion, family is very imp- important.  Ah, family are the people that you can -- that are always there that you can depend on no matter what when everything else is going crazy, when the rest of the world is going out -- those are the people that are always gonna be there for you and with you.
L:  I -- I totally agree.  I think, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, your family loves you no matter what.  They might be disappointed in you [LAUGH] sometimes or, um, things along those lines but they love you when you're at your best and when you're at your worst and -- or at least, that's how a family should be.
R:  Right.
L:  And, um, l- like, I'm real fortunate because I have a really wonderful family who is very supportive of me but, um, you know, I -- I definitely wanna give my own children that and, you know, that feeling of security that we're always there for them and y- -- they might do something really bad, we might be d- disappointed in their behavior but we're there for them.  So --
R:  Right.
L:  I think that's, um -- that's really important.  Kind of, gives people a sense of belonging, um --
R:  Right.  And I -- I would like to give my children the same.  Um, what's the make up of your family?
L:  Um, well, I have two daughters.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They're, um, nine and six years old.  And, um -- and I'm married.  Um, [SIGH] and then, my parents are still married.  They have, you know, their grandparents in their life and, um, my mother has a huge family -- she had ten brothers and sisters. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my. [LAUGH]
L:  And my husband has a very large family.  He was actually raised by his grandmother and his grandfather but, um, [LIPSMACK] all of her children are, basically, like his siblings.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And she had seven of her own.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, there's nine [LAUGH] of 'em.
R:  Oh, right.
L:  So -- so, you know, they have --
R:  So, that m-- you have -- you come from two large families.
L:  I- it's wonderful 'cause they have lots of aunts and uncles and cousins and people that they know that there's a lot of people that love them and that they can count on that if they need something they can call any of these people and they're there for them.  And --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I think that does make them feel more secure than, you know, if -- if they didn't have that --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- in their lives.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I have a son and a daughter.  My son's ten, my daughter's six.  Um, I am also married and both of my parents are still married and are very active in my children's lives.  Um, my husband -- I come from a family with, um -- we had three girls.  I'm the oldest of three girls.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, my dad's sister had seven children so we have a lotta cousins around 'cause they were always there.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, my husband comes from a small family.  It was him and a brother and his brother passed away so it's just him and his mom.
L:  Oh.
R:  And he comes from a really small family.  So, family is really important to him.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And his mom and his dad were not together.  So, his mom and dad separated when he was three so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- he didn't have that growing up so he makes an extra effort with our children --
L:  See, I notice that with --
R:  -- to try to make up. 
L:  -- my husband too.  Um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  His parents were divorced and that, um -- his father was always very involved in his life and actually lived with his grandparents but he had to work.  So, that's why the grandparents, basically, raised him.  But, um, I've noticed that he is much more involved than a lot of fathers and I think that it does go back to that, you know, he felt something missing in his life --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because his parents weren't together and, um, you know, he wants to make sure that his children don't go through that.  And that was one of the things that we discussed before we got married was, you know, what are the things that you absolutely could not forgive? [LAUGH] You know, that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that -- there would -- there would be a divorce over.  Because, you know, he was very, you know, "I -- I do not want a divorce ever".  So, "You tell me what you couldn't forgive and I'll make sure [LAUGH] I never do it".  So --
R:  Right.
L:  Um, I think that really has an affect on children and, you know, I know there's situations where you have to get divorced because someone's abusive or cheating or whatever the case may be but, um, I think I would always try to work things out unless it was something really horrible because -- because of the children.
R:  Right.  And I think I would do the same and my husband and I have talked about the same, you know?  Um, because family is so important to him and he has, ah, said that there is nothing that could happen that would make him want a divorce 'cause he is like anti divorce also.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I think that stems back from his mom and his dad.
L:  I think so.  My --
R:  And him being so young.
L:  My husband's the same way.  I mean, I don't -- I would never, ever cheat on him because I was raised that that is very wrong to do to somebody but, um, I think even if I did that I don't think he would divorce me.  I think he'd be pretty ticked off. [LAUGH]
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  But I don't --
R:  I think we're in the same boat. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Sounds like we have a lot in common [LAUGH] actually.
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]
L:  But, um -- but yeah.  He's -- he's very, um, you know -- he -- he wants a certain situation for his children and -- and he also had very firm views on how many children he wanted though.
R:  Mhm.
L:  He actually only wanted one at first. [LAUGH] And, um, I didn't want one because I was an only child. [LAUGH] So --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I did not want my children to go -- I -- I want them to have a sister or brother there to fall back on because what I'm s- -- cho- -- what I'm facing right now is my parents are getting older and when they're gone, it's just me.
R:  Right.
L:  I'm by myself, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, having aunts and uncles and cousins and -- but it's not the same.
R:  Right.
L:  And, um -- and, you know, that -- that makes me really sad when I stop and think about it and I never wanted my children to go through that and he was going from the opposite side of he was raised in a huge family. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  Right.
L:  And, you know, one child gets all the advantages if you just have one.  So, we, kinda, compromised and had two.  So --
R:  Right.
L:  Um --
R:  And I -- I think something that has affected my husband as well is, um, being that his -- his brother and he were very close -- they were about a year a- and a half apart --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and when his brother, ah, died about tw- -- about fifteen years ago now, he was the only one left.
L:  Mm.
R:  And now that his mother's getting older, everything falls --
L:  All the responsibility.
R:  -- on him.  And -- and being a man, it's a little bit different from being an only child and being a -- a woman.
L:  Right.
R:  I think.  Because he relies on me to help out a lot with things with his mother.
L:  Well, you know, I --
R:  And -- yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  I think that it's just an only child thing because my husband does a lot for my parents --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and -- and -- but I mean, he -- he volunteers to.  But I see a lot of it fall onto him and, you know, they're really not his parents. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  So [LAUGH] -- but I mean --
R:  Right.
L:  -- he's wonderful, you know?  He's, like -- my dad had to have an operation on his shoulder and he's been going and mowing the lawn for him and that's an hour and a half drive to their house each way.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, um, and I mean, he just volunteered to do that and he's been going and doing it and, um -- so I mean, I think that's just when you have m- -- you only have one child in the family.
R:  Right.  You know --
L:  Somebody -- yeah.  Somebody has to help.  I mean --
R:  Yeah.  Has to pick up the slack.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  And my mother in law and my parents are both five hours away from us.
L:  That's a --
R:  So --
L:  -- good drive.
R:  Yeah.  We have a good ways to go.  W- where we live, we have -- we live in Georgia -- Atlanta, Georgia and none of our family's here.  It's just us here.
L:  Okay.
R:  And so, we have to make an effort to -- to go and visit family.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Both my side and his side.  My parents and his mom are about an hour apart.  And --
L:  Well, we're, um -- we're in Indianapolis area and everybody's pretty close j- -- I mean, within an hour or two of us so that's, kinda, nice.  I -- I really like that.  Um, the immediate family.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And my husband has a sister and, you know, she's real involved in the kids' lives and she's the crazy aunt that has fun with them, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  Mm. [LAUGH]
L:  And -- and she gets them a lot and takes them swimming and stuff and -- and that's just really good --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for kids and --
R:  That's good.
L:  Yeah.  It's tal- --
R:  And we -- w- we do make the extra effort.  Like, in the summers --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they go, um -- we go -- any time we have a break -- I work in the school system, you know, I'm a teacher so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- any time we have a break we go and visit with family.  During the summertime, they go for weeks at a time and go visit with family.  Sometimes, I go along and sometimes I don't.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, you know?  My husband, his job req- -- um, -quires that he travels a lot so sometimes I just travel around with him in the summer while the kids go back and forth between --
L:  Oh, that's a good idea.
R:  -- grandparents and aunts and -- 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- you know?  And they love it.
L:  We always did that when we were kids too.  We were always at a cousin's house or an aunt's house or, I mean -- and some of my best memories are just, you know, staying --
R:  Right.
L:  -- with my aunts and uncles for weeks.
R:  We did the same. [LAUGH]
L:  So [LAUGH] --
R:  We did the same. [LAUGH]
L:  So --
R:  Yep.  As a matter of fact, speaking of family, um, my husband will be traveling to New York on Sunday for, ah, business.
L:  Okay.
R:  And my aunt and uncle, who I used to visit with a lot when I was growing up, both live there and I'm tagging along just so I can go and visit them. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  Oh, that'll be really nice.
R:  Because I haven't seen them in a -- in a while.  So --
L:  Yeah.  That'll be really nice.
R:  -- you know?
L:  It's, kinda, nice to reconnect 'cause I think, as we get older and get our own families, it's real easy --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to not have as much time --
R:  You d- -- get disconnected.
L:  Yeah.  I do that even with aunts and uncles that live real close [LAUGH] to me and I start -- I sit and think about -- I start feeling guilty.  I'll call them and be, like, "Let's meet for [LAUGH] lunch" --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, 'cause you realize, oh, I haven't talked to them for, like, two or three months and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that's terrible.
R:  You get your own children and you -- you just lose sight.  It's like you're --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's like two separate parts of a family --
L:  Right.
R:  -- of one -- one family.
L:  Right.  And -- and me and my husband were just talking about this today.  It's so strange.  We were talking that maybe we should, um -- we just bought a house and we really like it but we're thinking [LAUGH] about selling it and moving closer to my mom and dad because they really wanna be more involved in the kids' lives even than they are and when it's an hour and a half each way, it's, kinda, hard to do that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, we're, kinda, like, "You know, the kids aren't totally attached to their friends at school" 'cause they just redistricted us -- we're in a new school anyway.  And, you know, it would be, kind of, nice to have, maybe, five or ten acres out in the country and -- we're on one acre right now.  So [LAUGH] --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- we're -- we're working up in stages.  But it would be really nice to be a little bit closer to, you know, the grandparents that are really involved in their lives.  And, um -- 'cause my husband's grandparents have passed away and -- and his father passed away so they really don't have any grandparents on that side.
R:  Right.
L:  And, um, you know, and they -- they really need that so we're -- we're, kinda, chatting about it and thinking it over.  But, it -- you know, it's a big move.  You get s- --
R:  Right.
L:  You get used to --
R:  And you make sacrifices for family.  So --
L:  Yeah.  You do.  And you, kinda, get used to living in a place and I really love this house and I really love our location but, at the same time, you know, I -- I can see the advantages to moving.  So --
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, we were just talking about that today so it's really, kinda, freaky. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]
L:  So, it's a good topic.
R:  Yes.  Very -- very much so.  Yes.
L:  Now, are y- --
