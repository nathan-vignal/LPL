R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Ah, hi.
L:  Hi.  This is Tricia.
R:  Ah, this is Maria.
L:  Hi.  Nice to meet you over the phone.
R:  Ah, likewise.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, let's see ... the topic was -- in general, it said corporate conduct and then, um, h- -- they talked about, I guess --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- corporate scandals.
R:  Right.  That was --
L:  Um --
R:  -- number one but it was, like, three questions.
L:  Yeah.  Okay.  Did you write them down or ...? [LAUGH]
R:  I remember the first one and the third one.
L:  Okay.
R:  But I guess once -- as long as we keep on topic it should be all right.
L:  Right.
R:  So, the f- -- so, the first one is, um, just, basically, corporate scandals in general?  Or e- -- no.  How the government should, ah -- whether the government should curb business activity.
L:  Right.
R:  Well, you wanna go first or should I? [NOISE]
L:  Um, you can go first.
R:  Okay.
L:  M- --
R:  Thanks.  I suppose, the government should definitely curb business activity.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because, I mean, seeing as it has a responsibility to its citizens and so on and if, like -- if a business is, like, lying to its customers that's a- -- like -- like -- like, stealing because if the customers are paying for a service that's not being provided or, you know, for, like -- for bad products, then the business is really taking money away from them, like stealing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that's, kind of, illegal.  So -- yeah.  And --
L:  Yeah.  Well, and not only that but it -- they could still even be providing a good product but what they do is they, um -- in the accounting practice and methods they, sort of, um, can inflate certain numbers so that the stock will go up, um, so their company will be worth more, um, and to get some, sort of, publicity.  So, a lot of it is not just, ah, about the product itself but about the accounting practices, um, and having some more +vigilance in that particular area.  Um --
R:  Yeah.  That's true.
L:  Because a lot of these companies --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- like the Enrons, um, that went down, the accountants -- the big accounting firms went down with 'em like Arthur Andersen.  So, it's, sort of, um, all entwined and if the government were to just check on the companies, they would need to check, um, on their accountants and their lawyers and th- -- all the way up and down the chain.
R:  Mhm.  Definitely.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Like, there should be some, kind of, government agency for it.  You know, like the stock market has the --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- the +regulatory thing.
L:  Which I guess they're -- I'm not even sure if they specifically have something like that.  Ah, you know, is there a government agency or is it just they don- don't have the resources?  Is -- has anything been created to tackle those --
R:  Well, I guess they --
L:  -- problems?
R:  There -- there're definitely laws in place but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't think they're, like, centrally enforced, you know?  Like, there is no just one agency whose job it -- it is to do only that kind of thing.
L:  Mhm.  So, that -- that's a possibility of getting some sort of, um -- there would have to be a budget allotted for that and the agency created and the manpower to do it. [LAUGH]
R:  True.  But, you know, there -- there will be people who are gonna be against this.  Like, I mean, f- -- well, like, people who are against, ah, too strenuous government regulation, you know?
L:  Right.  People that are for free enterprise and, um, not having every piece of their business-- of their private enterprise, ah, um, [LIPSMACK] what's the word ... [LAUGH] scrutinized, um, by the government.
R:  Yeah.
L:  What -- what was the third question?  I can't r- -- well, do you know?
R:  How, um -- how, like, ah, government's regulation on businesses can affect you or, you know, has affected you?
L:  Oh, you're right.  How has it personally affected you?  Well, I did lose quite a bit of money in the stock market or enough that, um -- that would -- that I feel that it affected me not -- not that I invested in any of the companies that were, um, caught, ah, with scandals but I did, you know, feel the +remnants of that as the market just reacted to, um, you know, Enron and -- and a few of the others.
R:  Was this, like, only because of Enron or were you given false information about the companies you invested in?
L:  Um, well, the companies that I was invested in, I basically had some mutual funds and I -- I basically trusted, you know, through the stock broker that those companies were viable and I did read reports but I basically invested in the large names.  And, um, like I said, none of them --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- directly, ah, had any problems but I just -- what I'm saying is, in general, I think the market was affected by that and if you have even one or two large companies, um, that are not following practices, then it's just -- it's going to affect the whole market.  There's gonna be -- the trust is not going to be there and the confidence and that's what happens.  And I think everybody was affected by that.  Anybody who was in the market, um, along with the, you know, economy and whatever other factors were happening at the time, the scandals certainly didn't help. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  That's true.
L:  Um, how about you?  Were you ...
R:  No.  Because I've never actually invested in anything.  So -- yeah.
L:  Well, that's good.  You didn't lose any money then. [LAUGH]
R:  No, not yet at any rates.
L:  [LAUGH] Um, did you have any ideas about what the government could do to be more involved or would that basically be the idea of creating the agency or a specific --
R:  Well, creating the agency --
L:  -- group?
R:  -- and making laws, like, ah, all companies must, you know, submit their accounts for you.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, like, and that's just, like, required.  Or they -- or [MN] -- or they must make their accounts, like, very clear and explicit and submit them for you.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Stuff like that.
L:  Okay.
R:  What about you?
L:  Um, I think the -- the idea of the creation of a specific group that would, um, if -- watch over corporate America would be a good idea.  Just like you said, I have, like, the FCC, you know, the Federal Communications Commission and there's a lotta federal regulation in other industries but, um, apparently doesn't incorporate the way it should into, um, corporate America.  And, um, whether it be public or private companies, I mean, there has to be some sort of responsibility.
R:  Mhm.  True.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] let's see ...  I don't know what the second question was.  I guess we can't comment on that can we? [LAUGH]
R:  No.  It's all right.  I mean, we think we've covered all the major points.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, you know, about the agency, it's, like, you, kinda, have to be very careful about who you pick because if you c- -- pick people who have invested a lot in the big companies or whatever, or who'll like -- owes of them or something like that.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, I mean it's -- you know what's gonna happen then.
L:  Right.  You have to find people that are really, ah, unbiased and get away from, um ...  And sure, I mean, corporate America -- and also being, possibly, a little shady themselves, um, because you never know about corporate America.  F- for example, the tobacco industries or the oil industries having -- there's a lot of industries out there that are -- that are doing harm but you would never, ah, [LAUGH] -- you know, they're -- they're never gonna come down because they just have too much involved as far as money, power, politics.  Um, it's a tight link.  And I think that's a great point that it would have to be a group that, you know, was not going to be linked or tempted to be linked or, in some way, not really, um, do their jobs.
R:  True.  So, basically, anybody who has contributed a lot to what -- to any, you know, ah, presidential candidate or whatever should be out because you know they would have ties to big business.  Like, really big ties.
L:  Right.  Exactly.  That's a very good point.  And, maybe, even getting people that are, you know, more radical.  I don't know f- -- you know, f- --
R:  Yeah.  Like --
L:  The --
R:  Well, I mean, I suppose socialists or somebody but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- yeah.  That's not gonna happen in America.
L:  No.  Or but -- you know, like a Ralph Nader type of group c- -- you know?  That kind of thing connected.  If they could get people like that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- more con- -- who are more consumer advocates because that's really who it's hurting is the consumer.
R:  True.  That --
L:  Um --
R:  That would definitely be nice.
L:  Yes. [LAUGH] Um, but that's -- that's definitely, um ... gosh.  It w- -- it would be quite a job to find that but it would be worth trying, you know?  I mean, there's gonna be some corruption everywhere but it would definitely be worth trying to find the right kind of group to do that and not, ah, just a politically connected, um, money powered group.
R:  Yeah.  But it's -- I -- I mean, chances are, that that's what's gonna happen but at least there will be laws in place and you can't --
L:  Right.
R:  -- help but it be the laws.
L:  I mean, that there -- there are those laws and it seems to work for some other, you know, governing bodies.  Um, so, I don't know.  I mean -- and we're talking about -- this is, like, the topic of corporate conduct in the USA and I mean, you think about, you know, other -- if -- how it compares to other countries.  Like you were saying that, like, socialist -- more socialist countries and --
