R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  My name is Cynthia
R:  Cynthia, I'm Miranda.
L:  Hi Miranda.
R:  How are you?
L:  I'm good.
R:  Good.  Where are you calling from?
L:  I'm calling from Moorhead, Minnesota.
R:  Get out!  I'm in Minneapolis. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, you're kidding? [LAUGH] 
R:  No. [LAUGH] How funny.  And I [NOISE] --
L:  That is unusual.  My last one was South Dakota.
R:  Really?  Mine was, ah --
L:  No, I mean -- no, no, no -- South Carolina.
R:  Yeah.  Mine was Ohio.
L:  Oh.
R:  I used to go, um -- I went to NDSU -- I graduated from NDSU.
L:  Me too.
R:  Really? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's crazy.
L:  In textiles.
R:  In what?
L:  Textiles and clothing.
R:  Get out!  I was in fashion merchandising.
L:  No kidding? [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] What year did you graduate? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Ninety two.
R:  Oh, okay.  I graduated in e- -- the fall of eighty eight.  So --
L:  I graduated from high school then. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I'd already been attending NDSU -- 
R:  So, I was just leaving NDSU as you were coming.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.  What a small world, huh?
L:  That is really weird.
R:  Wow, I can --
L:  How did you start doing the survey -- doing these?
R:  Um --
L:  Are you on the Refunding magazine, by any chance?
R:  What?
L:  Are you on the -- like, the Refunding Makes Cents magazine?
R:  No.  Actually --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- there's this alternative weekly newspaper in Minneapolis called City Pages and I --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- saw it in there.
L:  Oh.  I f- -- I found it on a website of -- of c- -- people who do couponing and refunding and stuff.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  That's how I found it.  Yeah.
R:  Um, how many times have you -- do you just get to do this three times, right?
L:  I don't really know 'cause I've got some people on our board who've done it, like, eight times.
R:  Oh, you're kidding?
L:  Yeah.  Because they just keep calling in.  They -- you get called three times -- they'll call --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you three times but if you keep calling in --
R:  Oh.
L:  If you call in, I guess you can still do them or something.  And there's -- they're getting paid for it.  I'm, like, cool.
R:  That I should keep doing --
L:  I can do this for ten bucks.
R:  Yeah.  Ah, 'cause I'm unemployed right now, so, like any little bit helps, you know?
L:  Exactly.
R:  Wow.  So, we should talk about family I guess. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.
R:  So, I -- you know, my personal opinion is that it probably doesn't matter so much what we talk about.  They just wanna hear us speak, I think.
L:  I think so too.
R:  And interact with one another.
L:  Is it -- is it, like, our accent or how we tal- -- I -- I'm wondering what they mean by how we talk?
R:  I bet it's everything.  Like, when we pause, when we say, "Uh-huh" when the other person is speaking --
L:  Or if we cut each other off by talking over each other. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  It's, you know, the words that we choose to affirm the others speech because I'm sure they vary by region throughout the United States and --
L:  Well, that South Carolina guy, I mean, he kept u- -- accusing me that I had an accent and I'm, like, "Sometimes I can't understand you at all". [LAUGH]
R:  Really?  'Cause --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you don't sound like you have an accent to me at [LAUGH] all.  That's funny.
L:  No.  Um, --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- me either.  You sound just like me, you know?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Just [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [LAUGH] a normal person --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- 'cause we're in the northern states here.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Ah --
R:  So, what does family mean to you Cynthia? [LAUGH]
L:  Well, personally, to me, family means, like w- -- I guess when all my family gets together we do things as a group, you know, what --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- otherwise, depends on if they're considering family, like, a mom and dad and kids kinda thing.  If it's --
R:  Oh, I think it just -- it --
L:  That kind of family --
R:  -- you can --
L:  -- do they mean, like --
R:  Whatever w- -- however you define it, you know?  For some people, it's probably just groups of friends if they're --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- disenfranchised from their biological family.  I don't know.  I'm with --
L:  I don't -- I -- I'd have a har- -- my -- personally, I would have a hard time considering the word family -- I would have a hard time considering, l- like two guys or two ladies with children.  I mean that, to me --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- doesn't -- you know, I realize it's a family 'cause there's children there and all that, kinda, stuff --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- f- for some of them -- but to me, a family is, like, a husband and wife and children or --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- a family is, like, grandma, grandpa, mom, dad -- all these people.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  To me, a family is, like, lots of people. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  Groups that are always getting together for everything.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  At least that's how we are.
R:  I, um [LIPSMACK] -- I'm actually living with my sister right now because I just got back from the Peace Corps and I'm trying to readjust --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- to life in the United States.  Well, I guess it's not just -- it's been a whole year now but --
L:  Adjusting, though, must not have been easy.
R:  It's -- well, I think it would be a lot easier if the economic climate wasn't so poor.  It's just really --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- bad right now and I'm having a difficult time finding permanent employment.  I just had a temporary job --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which was nice.  It helped me save a little bit of money but I certainly can't get my own place.  So, for me right now, family isn't just somebody that I share the same blood with.  They're [LAUGH] my --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- support group, my life line right now because one of my sisters is allowing me to rent a room from her and, um, so it's very, very important.  And it also he- -- for a larger reason, I decided to return to Minnesota.  I grew up here but I haven't lived here since I graduated from NDSU.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I went out to Washington State and stayed there for, probably, ten years.  But I decided I wanted to be closer to my family after having lived away from them for so long.  So --
L:  I think you've n- -- for me, I forgot what kinda support they were.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And if something happened, there was always somebody to talk to and it wasn't long distance.  You had somebody that you could run over to their house and say, "I just need to cry" you know?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That kinda thing.
R:  Yeah.  I haven't had that for so long.
L:  'Cause I guess my m- -- my mom's always been there for me.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  My dad's just, kinda, well, if I needed something fixed or mended --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, fixed or done --
R:  It's Dad's style.
L:  -- he's there for that but it's -- it's different.
R:  Do they live in Moorhead then?
L:  Yep.  Yep.
R:  Oh, so y- -- did you grow up there?
L:  Yep.
R:  Wow.
L:  But then I, you know -- I left for a while 'cause I was, you know -- you try that New York thing.  You think you're gonna make it so well in --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the fashion industry and you don't. [LAUGH] 
R:  Really? [LAUGH]
L:  I'm sorry.
R:  You know, I, um -- I had a double major -- one was in, um, communications, journalism and the other was in fashion merchandising and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I realized, I think it was my sophomore year, that I preferred journalism over fashion merchandising but I decided to just finish the fashion merchandising major since I had started.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's kind of a fallback.  But I have to tell you, I haven't done anything with it since I graduated from college and have no intention, frankly.  I just -- it doesn't interest me at all any more and how people make money in that business is beyond me.  I mean --
L:  Me -- me too.
R:  -- I know you were more in the design end of it but either --
L:  See, I was in the design end of it but my girlfriend made it further in New York to where she was designing for Donna Karan.
R:  Really?
L:  But Donna would steal her -- you know, she would have -- Renee would have awesome designs and drawings and create them and sell them and everything --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- because she was a perfect sewer -- a lot better than I was.  And Donna would change one thing and claim it as her design.  So, Renee was constantly getting stepped on in the fashion world.
R:  Yeah.  It's not like you have a copyright for design --
L:  No.
R:  -- items is it?
L:  There is nothing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Donna would change everything.  And she just got so sick of it and she didn't like having to buy an orange here and a piece of bread over there and, you know, there wasn't so called grocery stores like what we have.
R:  What?
L:  So --
R:  There has to be.
L:  M- -- well, ah, she lived way in inner city New York.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, I mean, she had to buy her fruits and vegetables off of stands and things.  And --
R:  I would love that though. [LAUGH]
L:  She just got sick of it 'cause she likes to walk into, you know, Hornbacher's or Sunmart and just go, "Hoo hoo" you know --
R:  Really?
L:  -- go up and down aisles and pick out food, you know?  But --
R:  Huh.  That's funny.
L:  She came back, you know?  'Cause her twin sister and her family was here and she, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Her family means a lot more to her than her fashion career so ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, she left that world.  And I have to be honest, I work at Walmart in the fabrics department.
R:  Really?
L:  And I have for twelve years now and [LIPSMACK] there's not really anywhere you [LAUGH] can go with that.
R:  See, that's the thing --
L:  'Cause unless you can design, you're nothing.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I feel.
R:  And even if you can, you still have to have the capital and the resources --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- to market yourself and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that takes a whole another set of skills.  It takes money and it -- it's a f- -- I think it's, kinda, funny that NDSU in Fargo, North Dakota, like [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.  I know. [LAUGH]
R:  Even opera is sat as a major.  I'm not saying they shouldn't but it's not like it's a- -- the capital, ah -- fashion capital of the world or anything.  It's not even close.
L:  I know.  I mean, we're farm families.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We're farming and, you know, the families take over the family farm.
R:  Right.
L:  It's not like -- you know, fashion just doesn't make any sense to them -- to their -- their --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- Wrangler jeans [LAUGH] and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- western shirts, you know?
R:  Right.  Did they think you were crazy when you decided to major in that?
L:  Well, I've been sewing since I was seven so I --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- loved to just create for Barbie and all those --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- little dollies but they never figured that I would, you know, leave the area and try to do that --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and then, you know, it was -- it was a little humbling to have to come back and say, "Hey, it didn't work and it cost a fortune out there".  And I mean, it was twelve hundred dollars a month --
R:  But aren't you glad you did it though?
L:  Huh?
R:  Aren't you glad you did it?
L:  Yeah.  I'm glad I stepped out but twelve hundred dollars a month for an apartment was ridiculous.
R:  Right.  But do you n- -- you now know that first hand and had you lot left Moorhead --
L:  Yes.  Right.
R:  -- you wouldn't have known anything but Moorhead and, I don't know about you, but I would've had a meltdown. [LAUGH]
L:  Well --
R:  I --
L:  -- and it's so much more friendly.  Everybody smiles and says, "Hi" and in N- New York, no one pays attention to you.
R:  Does -- yeah.
L:  You're a nobody.  You don't know who's next door to you.  You don't know who's being beaten against the wall.  You know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  It wasn't --
R:  Huh.
L:  I didn't like it.
R:  How long ago did you return to Moorhead?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, I've been at Walmart for twelve years so, it -- probably, about fourteen years ago I came back.
R:  Oh, I see.  Wow.
L:  So, um --
R:  A good spell of time that you've been in Moorhead.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I was just there, um -- well, actually in Fargo a coup- -- about a month ago and I was shocked at how big it's gotten.
L:  It's huge.  It's just expanding out all over.
R:  It's just sprawling out by West Acres.  I'm, like, "Whoa". [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's amazing.
L:  And that just got rebuilt with a new big humongous food court.
R:  Oh, did it?
L:  Yes.
R:  I didn't actually go inside.  I just went to visit a friend from -- from university who -- who still lives there and, um, I was surprised.  I had heard it was growing but it's --
L:  It's gotten huge.
R:  -- one thing to hear it and another to see it.  So --
L:  They went way out the front and they got twenty some restaurants in the front of that building now.
R:  Really?  Wow.
L:  It's nice 'cause people -- a lotta people -- you see a lotta families going out -- family, family -- you get it?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You get a lot of families that can get together around a lotta different tables and a lot of different places in the food court --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and it's the easiest place to meet somebody.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  'Cause it's centralized.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right in the whole middle, kind of, of the place.  So --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It cost mega millions to do it --
R:  But --
L:  -- but it does look nice.
R:  Who are all these people that are coming to Fargo?  Are they young families or ...?
L:  You know, around here, apartments are the number one thing being built and they're --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- practically rented before they're even finished.
R:  Really?
L:  And they're -- they're r- -- anywhere from four hundred to eight hundred a month.
R:  Eight hundred --
