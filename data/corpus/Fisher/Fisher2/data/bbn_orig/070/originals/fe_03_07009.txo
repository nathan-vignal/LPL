L:  Hi -- 
R:  Hi.
L:  -- I'm Susan.
R:  H- hello?
L:  Hi, I'm Susan.
R:  Hi.  I'm Mary Kay.  Nice to meet you.
L:  Nice to meet you.
R:  Um -- 
L:  Have you done this before?
R:  No, this is my first telephone call.
L:  Mine too so I'm [LAUGH] not quite sure what I'm doing.  But -- 
R:  Okay.  Well -- 
L:  -- computers in edu- -- 
R:  -- the topic [NOISE] is that computers in education, um -- I -- I don't know about you but I only have -- ah, right now I have one son [NOISE] who's only going to be two year's old so we haven't really experienced much in the [NOISE] way of education with the computer.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Have -- do you have any kids that [NOISE] use the computer?  [NOISE] -- 
L:  I don't have any kids but I have got plenty of education experience.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] I see.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Um, and I've -- 
R:  [NOISE] Have [NOISE] -- 
L:  -- I've -- I've used computers for a long time.  I just -- I -- I can't see how computers could be detrimental at all to education.
R:  Well, from what I've seen, um, and from the people I know who have kids, um, they really are helpful except, um, from the point -- standpoint of, you know, when I was a kid th- the big thing was a calculator in school -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, to some degree I sometimes think they kind of forget how to use the pencil and paper, you know, those -- the -- the basics.  Maths skills, things like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, they're great for education.  I mean, I'm -- I'm totally amazed at the things they do.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I'm not a computer geek myself.  I'm kind of a -- I guess I'm a -- +an intermediate user.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, it is pretty impressive the things they do for you.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, I can see the risk of forgetting -- y- you know, forgetting to use the basics, like, spell checker, for example.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, people f- -- get lazy about their spelling -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- when they know the computer will do it for them and now -- 
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- it -- it'll do their grammar, it'll do the grammar checking and all of that and it seems like people's writing skills are getting worse and worse.
R:  You know, that's why I noticed one of the changes -- ah, you know, where I catch myself using it because I myself, I'm a mystery shopper --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and so I -- I do a lot of reports and actually, you know, I have no problem with the English and -- and the grammer and that.  But, it is -- I will say it's nice because you know, I can c- -- I can, ah, copy it on to -- to Word, um, ah, Microsoft Word if they don't have their own spell check or grammar check and I don't even have to worry.  It'll tell me if I've messed up with my sums --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which is k- -- you know, it's -- it's a double edged sword.  It's a nice feature because you have it and the ability to make sure everything's done correctly but on the other hand, you're right, it makes me lazy 'cause if I -- if I make a bad sum I'm not too worried about it [LAUGH] 'cause I'm going to find out down the road.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um -- 
L:  Well, I mean, another thing that comes to mind is just, you know, on the other hand the computers are just becoming increasingly more a part of the workforce a- -- 
R:  Exactly.  You can't -- 
L:  -- and I've -- I've taken a -- I remember t- -- I took a typing test for a temp job once -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they didn't even really care if I +spelt the words correctly [LAUGH] because the spell checker could -- 
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- check 'em for me and so I -- it seems like even those -- the workforce is being changed to match, um, the capability of the computers and so -- 
R:  Yeah, there's not many places out there, um, other than small family operations that are not computerized yet.  I mean, the place that I last worked at, um, they finally got into the computer age around, I would say, the early nineteen nineties but part of that I can -- you know, when they show me the different things they did manually, I just couldn't understand that anybody out there would be doing those things still manually when the computer was there for you.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, it's so handy.  My husband uses it for, um, school because he --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- goes to college at night for his four year degree and so he uses it for that.  Um, the internet -- oh, my gosh, it's amazing the things you can do with that.  I -- I think I probably don't use a tenth of its capabilities --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, um, you know, I'm sure that I'll find out when my son gets to grade school because of course all the kids have to [LAUGH] have the computers and I'm su- -- you know, [several inaudible words] that I -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, the only -- the only thing, um, like I said, I -- I just -- that I'm concerned about is when I let him first start messing with the computer that he knows how to do those things -- 
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- on his own without having to depend on that computer --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- plus if the computer goes out, if your electricity goes out, then what do you do?  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Then you're stuck.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Or if your surf protector doesn't, ah, protect it as it's supposed to and you lose all your information, that can be, um, quite discouraging.  I've -- I've had that happen on occasion too.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  That does make us more vulnerable too when you rely on anything like -- you know, like a computer especially, you know, ah, with the way they crash and things like that.  That's always a risk.  But, you know -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you mentioned the internet and that was another thing that it came to mind as a double edged sword, um, with -- especially with kids increasingly surfing the internet that, you know, there's -- it's a whole a- -- world of it's own out there and just like there're dangers in the real world of -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah, crossing the street e- e- even.  You know, just going out on the internet, you never know what they're going to punch up and see and you have to -- 
R:  That's the -- 
L:  -- consider what -- you know, what do we want them to see.
R:  That's very true.  I never worried too much about filters and things before but, um, it just so happened one of the companies I did some work for, um, had been having some problems with their reputation etcetera and I believe people must have been hacking into their site because one day I received something from them and -- and some how attached to the bottom was, um, a nice little slide show of porno pictures --
L:  Oh, great.
R:  -- and when I called them they -- they couldn't see what I was talking about so I sent them back a copy and it still didn't show up on their end but I'd never seen -- I mean, I had no reason ever to look at that type of material anyway and when I saw it I just didn't know what to do.  [LAUGH] I --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- called them.  I was a little irate.  So, you're right.  I mean, it is dangerous from their stand point but the one thing, I guess, maybe they want to encourage anything about the internet is that, you know, for kids who don't like to read -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, you know, there's so much out on the internet.  Now granted, there's a lot of games so I guess I'll have to keep my son away from the games as he gets older.  But, um, you know, as far as their reading skills well the -- it makes, I guess, looking at the encyclopedia and things like that much more exciting.  Um, I -- I myself, you know, I can find s- sites and that but it's -- as far as finding newspaper articles, things like that, it's a little more complex for me because I'm not all that familiar with it.  But, um, you know, it -- it does -- I -- I guess the internet too itself does have it's benefits --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, well, heck, it makes school work a lot easier for -- even for adults.  I mean, my husband -- ah, that was -- you know, when we got that, when he started back to school and, um, he'd hardly ever go to the library.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] It's nice.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah -- 
R:  And -- 
L:  -- I found that myself too.  I mean, whenever I have a question about anything the first thing I do is punch up a -- a -- punch it into a search engine and I almost always find the answer that I'm looking for and so -- 
R:  I found out the hard way.  I mean, I s- -- I learned about [several inaudible words] and I -- [several inaudible words] couple of things and you're right, I mean, there's not really too many things that you can't find out there -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- with just a little patience and, ah, diligence --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you can pretty much [LAUGH] find what you're looking for.
L:  Yeah.  But, you also have to take it with a grain of salt too because there are a lot of inaccuracies out there 'cause people will just put up a web page and you don't know what their credentials are and so it -- 
R:  That's true.
L:  -- you -- you know, in education at least, like, with textbooks for example you know it's been through this editing process and that it's -- you can pretty much -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- m- -- put -- take the material to the bank for the most part at least.
R:  Right.
L:  But, like, on the internet, you know, you really have to be careful of what your sources are because, you know -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I've also run across misinformation too.
R:  Yeah, I think there's -- I think there's a lot of misinformation out there if -- if you're gullible enough to believe.  Like you said, you've just got to kind of use common sense when you're looking at the internet but, um, I mean, for the m- -- ah, for the most part it's -- it's probably a good thing it's just so much -- so much more than I had when I was a kid.  I mean, no one ever --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- thought of computers and -- and the -- the other thing about that is, you know, computers are not cheap by any means.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, that's the one -- you know, that's the one drawback that kids going to school that I see is well, now I think in college some of them almost have to have a laptop.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, I've heard of -- and I've even heard of some grade schools in -- in the [inaudible] area where I live, um, that require access, you know, to a computer and they tell you ahead of time, you know, they need to be able to access a computer 'cause part of their work will be on that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I mean, you know, it's great for the -- I don't want to say the well to do child but for the family who can afford one.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, unfortunately for those people, and there's plenty of areas out here in this part of Illinois that, um, are lower income people -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, it's -- I guess it's kind of a disadvantage for them because although they have the chance to learn the computer I don't see a lot of those people having computer availability at home --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and with the way that, um, the new technology comes out -- I mean, we had my last computer maybe, I don't know, maybe three years my husband started school and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when I started doing my mystery shopping and working from home we upgraded and I mean, you know, it's not hard to spend fifteen hundred or two thousand dollars.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, luckily I -- I'm a pretty good shopper so I have extra sales and that but, I mean, if you start getting into all the accessories and the extras that go with it -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, that's one drawback I see, you know -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because a lot of kids, their parents just can't afford it.  I mean -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- luckily we have one and I -- I know in our grade school they have, um -- which is a private school they have access to the computers and they, you know, can do a lot of it there but that is one negative too.  It is -- you've got to be able to afford a computer and the monthly ISP costs and now, of course, you've went past ISP into DSL --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- which is, well, let's see, it cost me probably about th- thirty dollars more a month but unless I have it, it -- you know, dial up takes forever --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, the other thing is we have some friends that live out in rural Illinois and when I say, "Rural" I mean r- rural, [LAUGH] I can't --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- say that word, I mean, in fact they -- their city is called --
