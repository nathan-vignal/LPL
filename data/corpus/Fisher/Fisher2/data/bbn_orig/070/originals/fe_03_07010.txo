L:  This is Jane.
R:  Yeah, this is Carl.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  Um, I guess we talk a- -- +supposed to talk about education and how it helps, or something like that?
L:  Well, how computers help in education or whether they help and we're supposed to debate that.
R:  Oh, I see.  Well, I don't know nothing about computers, but I guess everybody else does, so ...
L:  Well, I don't know much about 'em, but I would say f- -- with the technology that's happening now it's a very good id- -- idea to introduce them as soon as possible.
R:  Yeah, well I think you should know about it because everything's geared up for computer a- -- anymore --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you can't do hardly anything without computer, everything's computer r- -- ran, you know, but --
L:  Yes.  
R:  But --
L:  Computer banking is even coming online more and more.
R:  Oh, yeah.  It's just um [MN] but I've got -- I got to admit, I've been showed how to ah what do they call that, um, get on the Internet --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and that's about it and then I get in there and I don't know what I've done [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But --
L:  Well, if you -- you can find out just a lot by -- just by b- -- g- -- punching up what -- what um do you have a computer?
R:  No, I sure don't.  I -- I -- I e- -- I go -- used to go to the library and they got 'em and I played with them a little bit, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but ah -- that's about it.  I don't know m- -- like my niece and nephew like they're like in the fir- -- first and third grade and they know how to send me- -- E messages and everything and I can't even do it that so I --
L:  Well, it takes a little bit of practice.
R:  Yeah.  I feel -- I feel pretty -- pretty um bad about ignorant[?] I don't know, I guess I should go take a course just so I can kind of catch up on the world and I don't know.
L:  Well, they help a lot.
R:  Yeah, I'd -- I'd say I- -- I- -- well, they would help, you know, like you know just everyday lives like finding a place to live or various things, you know --
L:  Mhm.  Yes.  All of those things.
R:  And um --
L:  I don't have a regular computer myself, I have something called Web TV --
R:  Oh yeah?
L:  -- which -- which accesses over the phone line and ah -- ah and uses the television screen instead of a separate monitor --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and you cannot do a lot of things on Web that you c- -- TV that you can do with a regular computer, but --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- it's -- it's -- it's a lot of fun.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh yeah, I bet it would be.  It's modern -- I see 'em playing games and everything [LAUGH] so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so, I don't know.  But I -- I'd say it'd be beneficial in your lives like w- -- looking for work or um just anything, like you say banking, I know a lot of them you know even like checking your banking account and credit ratings and all that on it.
L:  Mhm.  And you can pay bills online too instead of having too um e- -- find a stamp and write a check --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and have check charges --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and all that kind of thing.
R:  Yeah.  That would be a lot interesting, so ...
L:  It's -- it would be a lot easier, I have to set mine up, I haven't done it yet.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I don't know.  I -- you know, I guess th- -- just being able to afford a computer and just getting it to me it's just always been a -- I looked at it as an added expense, you know, so --
L:  Yeah.  It's -- and it's not only the expense of the computer, it's the -- there is the Internet Service Provider as well plus online access and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and that's a whole -- whole another expense every month.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I guess certain websites cost money too, or something like that, the way they explained it to me, I don't know.
L:  Well, some of them do, but most of them don't.
R:  Yeah, most of them's free.  I didn't -- I -- like I'm saying, I'm naive, my nieces and nephews know more about a computer than I do [LAUGH].
L:  Well, it's -- it -- it -- it's really very valuable, it do- -- and the younger you learn it, the better.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I'm getting up kind of past middle age, so it's kind of hard to teach me new tricks, you know.
L:  Oh, no, no, no.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Computers are very easy to do once you -- once you just practise at it a little bit --
R:  Just practise at it a little bit, yeah.  So -- well, I don't know.  Like I say, I've considered it, you know, I though maybe taking a class or two on it or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- getting somebody you know --
L:  I recommend it.
R:  -- getting somebody to show me, yeah, it's -- b- -- b- -- be -- be interesting for sure.  And --
L:  Mhm.
R:  But um [LIPSMACK] I don't know, I don't know.  I -- it seemed like ah you know basically everything's run by a computer, anything like they can [SIGH] check you out just by punching in your social security number on the computer I know now and all this and that and --
L:  Well, there is an awful lot of information that's -- that's available online.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Privacy is becoming a major problem.
R:  Yeah, I -- I -- that's kind of what I wondered, somebody said like your credit report and everything, not to ever, you know, check it online if they can keep record of it, you know, and I mean --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- somebody could get ah hold of it you know and stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I don't know.  I hear about viruses and stuff like that on computers, I don't know exactly what that is, but --
L:  So whiches?
R:  Viruses, you know, computer viruses.
L:  Oh, viruses, yes.
R:  Yeah, I -- I don't really know what that means or anything.
L:  Well that -- it -- that -- that's kind of -- of way of corrupting the ah language or corrupting the program that you have on the computer.
R:  Oh.  It's kind of like --
L:  It's just -- it's just nasty and mean.
R:  Oh, it's just a way to --
L:  Well, it's -- it's -- peop- -- people invent viruses to infect other computers just to show -- to be -- have their own power.
R:  Oh, just ah delete your computer or something?
L:  Well, or just screws it up.
R:  Yeah.  Where you can't, yeah, like --
L:  It -- it doesn't n- -- most of them are not going to go so far as to just -- as to delete everything --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but -- but -- or it can be also used --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to get on to your computer and then go through the address book that you've got on your computer and send it out to everybody else that's on your address book and it's just horrible.
R:  Yeah.  But --
L:  It's just mean.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I guess computers now in schools is just kind of part of everyday life in grade school and everything, they just kind of teach that too, don't they?  I mean --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- it's part of the curriculum or whatever.
L:  I would say so.  I'd say it would be a pretty sad -- a pretty sorry s- -- school system that didn't have 'em.
R:  Didn't have no computers, yeah, it'd be kind of eighteen eighties, you know, and just --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I always tell people I got a high school education which amounts to about sixth grade education now [LAUGH] so --
L:  Oh, jeepers.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I don't think it's that bad.
R:  That bad, no.  I don't know.  I d- -- I know a lot of things that you know that [SIGH] that we learned in high school or I learned in high school, seemed like they teach in grade school now or -- or -- 
L:  W- -- like what?
R:  Well, I don't know, you know, like I don't know it's just like someone done math and things like that, you know, it just ah -- it's more keyed up, you know, that they didn't used to teach and computers is something they never taught, you know, in school but you know when I --
L:  Well, they didn't have 'em.
R:  I know.  I -- no when I graduated, well they had 'em but it was like the FBI that the only person that had 'em or something like that --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it was really, you know --
L:  I guess I'm older than you are.
R:  Well, I graduated in seventy four, so --
L:  Yeah.  I'm tw- -- um, I'm oh, I'm only eight years older than you are.
R:  Yeah, but a [inaudible] just kind of begin to hear of 'em, you know, and it was just like, you know, like the you know it was like something the President had, or something, you know, it was --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it was -- if I remember correctly, of course, but, you know, it was um [SIGH] it was just kind of ah something they were just talking about and then all of a sudden now they've got 'em where, you know, anybody can basically have access to 'em or you know get 'em --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and --
L:  Yeah.  And having them in -- in the public libraries is wonderful.
R:  Oh, I think so.  There's a lot of, you know, data and they have 'em like in um -- well, like in, you know, work search, like in unemployment offices and stuff like that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if you want to go, you know, look for work, they have, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it's more up to date than you know um postings you know and stuff like that, it's um [SIGH] you know you know within a few seconds or they can you know change it in a few seconds, you know, or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or the paperwork might take days, you know, and stuff like that.
L:  Yes.  And it can be transmitted so quickly.
R:  Yeah, right.  [SIGH] So, it's um -- I think, you know, it's -- it's something I wish I'd learned or I guess I can still try [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, I think you ought to go see if -- what -- you can take a class in it.
R:  Yeah.  I think I'll give it a whirl or get my nieces and nephews or something or my brothers and sisters to teach me or somebody.
L:  Do your brothers and sisters have a computer?
R:  Yeah, I think about everybody in the family -- my family, you know, it's kind of sad, has a computer and knows how to use one but me [LAUGH].
L:  Well, you -- you just trot yourself over to one of your relatives' and do that thing.
R:  [LAUGH] I think I'm going to give it a whirl, I'm going to try -- I keep saying it, you know how it is, sometimes doing it, but I [LIPSMACK] I don't know.
L:  And they're fun, too.
R:  Yeah.  It's um --
L:  There's all kinds -- there's all kinds of things -- there's all kinds of chatrooms and a- -- I'm on five d- -- well, actually seven different um email lists, it's not like a chatroom because if --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- because it's not instantaneous, but it goes --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the inform- -- your information goes to a server and then it's e- -- given out to everybody on that list and you have topics that you talk about or type about --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we -- we all -- all of our- -- all the lists that I'm on started from reading a certain author's books.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  And um we're -- several different authors and -- and it's really, really en- -- entertaining.
R:  Well, I bet it would be.  Be some way to pass your ti- -- pass the time, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And ah stuff, you know.  [MN] Talking about education, I remember when I was in the first -- first grade we learned our ABCs and everything like that --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- now I think you've got to know them to get accepted to preschool, you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [LAUGH] so --
L:  Ah, no, I think -- I think that's what you're supposed to learn in preschool.
R:  Preschool.  Well, I knew it was something like that.  I knew but ah -- my mom taught h- -- teaches head start and
