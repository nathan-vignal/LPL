R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, how're you doing?
L:  Good, how are you?
R:  And you are?
L:  I'm Candy First[?].
R:  Okay, and I'm K- -- I'm Kent Steff[?].
L:  I'm Sorry?
R:  I'm Stefo[?].
L:  Okay.
R:  Okay.  So, what does a family mean to you?
L:  Well, let's see, um, family means spending time together with my family, um, three kids and a husband and doing certain things outside and going to baseball games --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- and dinners and things like that.  How about yourself?
R:  Well, to me family means togetherness, ah, something you can -- someone you can always depend on to always be there for you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, you know, when you can always depend on family when you can -- can't depend on anyone else, although they say they ain't going to do nothing for you but they will always come through in a clinch --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- and, um, you know, sp- -- like you say, spending time, doing things together --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- like we have a family reunion we have coming up shortly, you know --
L:  Oh, great.
R:  -- and we're getting ready for that, you know.  It just, you know, seeing people that you don't see in a -- on a regular basis, you know, it's just fun, you know.
L:  Mhm, I agree.  And like you said, family will always be there whether they -- when they say they won't be, they usually are.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I -- at my last family reunion I met people that I didn't even know were related to me, that I'd known, you know, from seeing them out in the streets and stuff but I didn't know they were related to me, when we --
L:  Really?
R:  -- all showed up at the family reunion, found out that we were distant cousins and stuff like that.
L:  No kidding.
R:  And, ah --
L:  That's kind of neat.
R:  I don't know, family is just togetherness the way I look at it.  I mean, like, there's -- to me there's two types of family, there's your internal family which is all your relatives and there's the -- the family of the world, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I -- I mean the way I look at it, all people are family, you know, s- -- we have different opinions and different things, but we're all the same body, you know --
L:  Oh yeah, we --
R:  -- and one day we'll all come together and realize that.
L:  -- we come from the same place. 
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  [LAUGH] Takes a long time for -- for that knowledge to kick in though sometimes.
R:  Yeah, well, mainly -- mainly because it's -- everybody's trying to divide each other, you know --
L:  Uh-huh, I u- --
R:  -- and, um --
L:  -- I don't know -- I don't know.  Is --
R:  Well --
L:  -- there family where you live near?
R:  Oh, I have a -- I have, like, my immediate family, my brothers, sisters, my mother and father, and grandparents in this area --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- then I have a lot of family, like, the [inaudible] area upstate New York, down --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- south, you know, all over, you know.
L:  Yeah, that's where -- now where are you calling from? I'm calling from New York.
R:  Yeah, I'm calling from Washington DC.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm in Rochester, so --
R:  Okay, and I've got family live in Niagara Falls.
L:  No kidding?
R:  Which isn't far from you.  [LAUGH]
L:  No, no, we go to it -- we take the kids up to Niagara Falls at least one a year.  It's about -- ah, takes us about two hou- -- an hour and a half to two hours to get from our house and over the border through customs and things like that.
R:  Yeah, no, it was really amazing, like, my -- my -- my first cousins in Niagara Falls.  My mother's brother and his children --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, ah, they all come from South Carolina --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and it was only three of them, they all migrated three different places.  One of them went to California, one of them went to Niagara Falls and the other one came to Washington, you know.
L:  [LAUGH] Almost three different -- totally different parts of the United States.  Got to get somebody down Florida.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, what happened is like -- well, we do have relatives down there.  We had a big family re- -- not a family reunion, we had a big birthday party for my grandmother on Christmas day --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because she turned a hundred.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so she's the oldest person in the family living, so we got --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- together, and everybody from all over the country came to the party, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and that was when, you know, like I say, I met people there that I didn't even know was related to me, you know, I seen them, know, and spoke to them in the street but didn't know they were related to me, you know.
L:  That takes a lot of doing, you know --
R:  Yeah, um, we- --
L:  -- to get everybody to pull together like that.
R:  -- well, like my sister put it together.  We just called the families that we knew and let them get in touch with the people they knew, you know --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- because like, like I know cousins and other cousins don't know 'em, you know, and --
L:  Mhm, oh, I know how that goes, yeah.
R:  -- you know, so everybody just had to, you know, just make contact with everybody.
L:  And now with divorce and things like that, um, you got, like you said, you have cousins you don't even know about or first cousins that you don't even, I mean, you don't see because of divorces and things like that.
R:  Right.  And people, you know, move to different areas and stuff, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like I say, they all came together for my -- my grandmother, like I say, she was a hundred and she's the oldest person in the family, everybody --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- came, 'cause this might be her -- you know, and any time could be her last birthday, right.
L:  Oh, yeah, death is part of life.
R:  So we had -- we had like, ah, three hundred something people there from around the country, right.
L:  Did you all get tee shirts that said the same thing?
R:  Yeah, we all -- we all did tee shirts, you know.
L:  Probably be in, like, good house keeping or something.  [LAUGH]
R:  No, well, she got a -- she got a thing from President Bush, she got a -- a plaque from President Bush, you know --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and the Mayor of DC sent her a plaque, you know, and --
L:  Oh, that's neat.
R:  -- well, I think they did it for anybody who turns a hundred in the country, you know.
L:  Oh really, I hope I can live to be a hundred.  [LAUGH]
R:  You hope?
L:  Oh, sure.
R:  You mean when you b- become a hundred.
L:  Yeah, well that --
R:  You have to think positive.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's true.
R:  You are as you think, you know.
L:  Oh, yeah, that's true.  A lot of knowledge there, you know?
R:  Yeah.  And thing about it is, like she's -- like she's -- she doesn't get around very well, she's in a wheel chair --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but she has all her facilities, you know, she --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- she remembers everything, she knows everybody, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  She stays with --
L:  Yeah.  She's probably well -- lived a wonderful life -- a wonderful life, huh.  Lots of family that started with her.
R:  Oh, right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And, ah, she's the only one left of her immediate brothers and sisters, all of them are gone, you know.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, it's -- it's hard when that starts to happen 'cause sometimes, you know, people get depressed when their family starts to die.
R:  Um, yeah, she -- she outlived their youngest son, you know.
L:  Uh-huh, oh, yeah.
R:  You know, he died, um, when, on, ah, what's his name Jim-, no not Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton's last inauguration.
L:  Okay.
R:  He died on that inauguration day, you know.
L:  No kidding.
R:  And that -- that really hurt her 'cause that was her youngest son, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, so --
L:  Yes.  It's tough if you, ah, if your children go before you, I imagine.
R:  Yeah, well.
L:  Huh.
R:  You never know when your time comes, you know.  Nobody can pre- prepared for that, you know.
L:  Tha- that's what they say.
R:  And he was -- he was doing good, and the next day he got sick and went to the hospital and he was a coma for like, a long time, you know, he was up -- hooked up to a machinery, you know, and after a while they just said, you know, "Let it go", because --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- he wasn't -- ah, he wasn't responding, wasn't -- he wasn't really alive --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they were just keeping him alive on the machine, you know.
L:  Well, that's what they say, everybody, you know, they say, "No, but, you know, you don't know when your time is coming".  And last October I've got -- I got breast cancer and ever- -- you know, and of course it's the biggest fear, is if you're going to make it that long and -- and it's funny 'cause everybody says, "Well, you never know when you're going to leave".  And it's like, you could get hit by a bus, that's my favorite story, is you could get hit by a bus.  It's like, "Yeah, but usually the bus isn't there at the corner revving it's engine", you know.  [LAUGH] So, you never know when you're going to go, so it's like I say, I hope to live to be a hundred.
R:  Well, I always tell people, if you knew the bus was going to come at a certain time and hit you, you'd make sure you avoid that area, [LAUGH] you know.
L:  [LAUGH] That's true.
R:  You know, but, um --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- I -- I don't know, we -- I mean, like I say, there's -- there's a universal family, you know, one day we'll all realize that we're all a family, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we're a brotherhood and, you know, we all have -- we gonna either make it on this planet together or we gonna [MN] perish -- perish, you know.
L:  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  And, you know, they say that, ah, heaven's like a tapestry from the bottom here.  It looks all, not composed, and it's all jagged edges and it's not very weaved, you know, but then when you get up on top you can see the whole tapestry and the beautiful picture from the top.
R:  Well --
L:  I don't know.  Like to think so.
R:  -- I just kind of believe that the -- the -- the -- the creator puts us here, he lets us make our own decisions.  He said we have to make it or, you know, he -- like, he could stop everything if he wanted to, you know --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- but he figures like, you know, we have to be -- learn to do it ourselves, you know, so he --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- he puts it in our hands, you know.
L:  Yeah, it's not a, ah -- you don't get to do a trial by error run, you know, you just go out and do it, so -- but, you know, family holds you together and sometimes family tears you apart, but it all --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- comes back to the same.
R:  Like I was the first one in my family, you know, to go to college --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um, I -- actually I was the first one to graduate from high school, and you know, it made me look -- feel good when I looked out and all my relatives were out there in the audience in -- in the graduation --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when I graduated from college they were all out there, you know, so, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, ah, one's that came from, like, like I say, I had peop- -- my people from, ah,  Niagara Falls even came down for the graduation, you know.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, you know, this -- this --
L:  So, how old are you?
R:  I'm fifty four.
L:  Are you?
R:  Yeah.
L:  No kidding, you sound young --
R:  I am young.
L:  -- you sound like you're -- I couldn't tell if you were eighteen or older.
R:  I am young, people don't get any older, they get better.
L:  [LAUGH] I agree there.
R:  Remember that [MN] -- remember that, you get --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- better, you don't get older.  [MN]
L:  Yeah.  Now, have you done these studies before?
R:  Ah, yeah, I've done quite a few studies, you know.
L:  No kidding.  This is my first one, so I'm not really sure of what to say or how -- how it works too much.
R:  Well, we basically supposed to go and stay on the topic, you know, and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they'll -- they'll -- they'll interrupt -- this your first call?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  Well, they'll -- they'll tell us when the ten minutes is up, you know --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and that'll be the end of it.  But, ah, I think you've got to do three in a row or something -- three and then you get paid, like, you know --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it -- it's just something, you know, that's interesting, 'cause you meet -- get to talk to people from different places, you know, and f- find out what their opinions -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- are, you know.
L:  'Cause I -- I signed up on the internet for this.
R:  Yeah, that's where I -- I -- I signed up too.
L:  Oh did you?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, I think it was on one of the sites I go to, and, ah, they were talking about it and I did get a call, like, last Friday but I wasn't here to take it.  So, it's kind of interesting to have it call back.
R:  Well, you know, I think they -- they'll keep trying, you know, 'cause they know -- they -- you know, they know when you sign up you don't know when your first call is coming, you know.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  'Cause I think I signed up and they called the very next day, you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  But I wasn't here.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  See now --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I've only signed up, probably about, maybe two weeks ago --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, it's interesting -- interesting.  The family time [LAUGH] on the -- on the computer. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, see, and they'll call you again tomorrow at the same time and they talk -- it'll be another subject, you know, you'll be talking to someone else from somewhere -- you -- you don't know who you're going to be talking to or where they're at, you know.
L:  Oh, they call every day?
R:  Well, I don't -- depending on what days you put in there.
L:  Oh, I just -- I think I put Monday through Saturday --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- from two to whatever.
R:  Okay, what it -- what it -- see whatever times you put in there they'll call you within that period, you know, but each --
L:  No kidding.
R:  -- day it'll be a different subject, you know.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um --
L:  Interesting.
R:  -- you just go in the conversation.
L:  Huh.
R:  And you'll v- -- you'll never probably talk to anybody you know, if you do -- if you do it'll be luck, [LAUGH] you know.
L:  Yeah.  I wonder how many people do do it, huh.
R:  Well, I'm sure a lot of people do it, you know, it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's just, you know, like I say, it's interesting.  You can make -- get to make a little money, you know.
L:  Yeah.  Well, we just got back from a ball game.  I had to actually leave early.  My son was playing, he's thirteen --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and, ah, it's st- --
R:  Baseball?
L:  Yeah.  It's still real cold up here, believe it or not.
R:  It's always cold up there.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Right, tell me about it.  This -- this winter was so long and I told my husband -- I said, "We've got to move somewhere because I can't take this".  It's like seven months and now it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- June and I'm still wearing -- I wore a turtle neck and a fleece thing to my son's --
