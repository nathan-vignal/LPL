R:  Hi.
L:  [NOISE] [PAUSE] 
R:  Hi.
L:  [inaudible] I didn't [NOISE] [inaudible], um, my cellphone -- hold on. [NOISE] [PAUSE] 
R:  I can barely hear you.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I'm Liz Anne.  I'm from, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- North Carolina.
L:  Oh, really? [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  What are we supposed to talk [LAUGH] about?  H- --
R:  Um, what does family mean to you.
L:  What does family mean to me?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay. [LAUGH] Ah, do you wanna go first?
R:  Um, sure.  Um, family means to me, basically, people who, um, love you and care, um, about you no matter what.  Um [LIPSMACK] -- um, people who pull up -- who put [LAUGH] up with your mess.  Um --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, people who, um [PAUSE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- who are, you know -- I mean, you can either -- you -- they're usually people you -- you either like or -- or don't like but you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- basically, you have to put up with to some extent.
L:  Right.  Okay.  I agree. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Um, anything [inaudible]?
R:  No.
L:  No?  Yeah.  I think same -- same thing.  Um, I'm -- I'm f- -- I'm in the LA area, [LAUGH] basically.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm in California.  Um, I, ah -- yeah.  Family -- you can't live 'em -- with 'em and you can't live without [LAUGH] 'em.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They drive you crazy but at some point it's like your time -- quick[?] time with them and build with them because that's where you come from and they're the ones that raised you.
R:  That's true.
L:  And n- -- kind of, a- affects who you are and stuff and ...
R:  Yeah.  That -- that's true.  They do affect who you are and what you do and, um --
L:  Everything.  Yeah.
R:  And -- and how if you -- if you have your own family or if you're going to have your own family one day, it does affect, um --
L:  How you raise them?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's right.
L:  So, you can't really run away from them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You have to --
R:  Because they're gonna show up, good or bad --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- at some point whether [inaudible].
L:  They're with you even when you're not with them. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because I know certain things that I -- you know, if I ever get married, certain things that I won't do or I know that I'm not going to do.  Um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just because of my experiences with my family or my personal experiences.
L:  Right.
R:  And, you know, they -- they affect so many people.  They affect your relationships with other people who are not related to you and, you know, they affect your future relationships, maybe, with your own children.
L:  Right.
R:  And that just passes on to some extent.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, they do have a lot of pull --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and a lot of hold regardless.
L:  [NOISE] Right. [NOISE] Yeah. [PAUSE] All that stuff. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] A very difficult topic.
L:  Yeah.  All that emotional stuff. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yup.  Um, how many minutes has it been?  Hold on. [PAUSE] I don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Ha- -- is this your first phone call?
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  Yeah.  It's mine too.  I h- had another phone call but my phone died.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I d- -- I couldn't finish that one.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, ah --
R:  Well --
L:  Well --
R:  -- at least they picked the interesting topic of, you know -- of -- of family.
L:  Right.
R:  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, no.  Ah, it's -- it's a simple topic but very difficult at the same time. [LAUGH]
L:  It's a broad topic.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  It is.  It is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It is.
L:  Yup.  Okay, what more can I say?  Hm ... [LAUGH] 
R:  Hm, well, let's see?  There are lots of family members that I would love not to be related to.
L:  Yeah.  I agree. [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I wished I had a choice of picking my own family members.  I mean, I think family should be like friends to some extent.  I think that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, you can't pick your family members but I wish I had family members like friends.  You know, because with friends, you pick people with the same values and similar experiences --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, interests or people --
L:  I guess, like, ah, in America it's -- it's just not valued enough and it's put to the side too easily, w- which is a big problem I think. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Hello?
R:  It's -- yes.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  That's true.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] I don't know where your [NOISE] f- family is from but --
R:  Um -- um, North --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Carolina.  I'm in North Carolina.
L:  Yeah.  Ah, you're not -- your family's not from a different country? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] No.  They're not.
L:  Yeah.  My -- my family is.  Well, my mom's side is.  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  And what country is that?
L:  Ah, Philippines.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.  And --
R:  So, do you think --
L:  -- people are much closer over there and know -- know who their relatives are.  I don't even know who most of [LAUGH] my relatives are. [LAUGH]
R:  So, you think it's a distinction between the way some cultures and some people are?  Their closeness with their family versus the way -- I don't know -- some Americans are with, you know ...  But then I don't know because the thing about, you know, people in this country is that not everybody is from this country and our --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- experiences are based on our own particular culture that we bring to it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  I -- well, it doesn't -- I mean, I'm not -- in general, it doesn't seem to be an emphasis in American culture.  It just seems, ah, your own self interest is the most important it seems. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  That's true.  That's true.  And especially some of my family members they, um, are from a rural area and, um, to somewhat, I guess, not large -- not l- l- -- I guess some are -- I guess some come from a large -- like, my great grandmother had ten children.  But, interesting enough, not --
L:  My grandma had thirteen. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But none of her children had --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- lots of kids.  I mean, they only had, like, two or one.  I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  None of them wanted the same largeness that they came from, you know?
L:  I think it has to do with, um -- well, it does have to do with, um -- 'cause they -- it was more, um, uneconomical being they have more kids back in the day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause you could help out with the farm and stuff but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- nowadays, it -- it doesn't help you, it only sets you back.
R:  Yeah.  That's true.  And it --
L:  For the most part.
R:  Yes.  That's true.  And it's easier to have a large family back then where you could depend on just one parent working --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- where now, as a family, you need to have, you know, two parents to make ends meet.  Depending on --
L:  For the cost of living.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It can miss -- yeah.  Depending on your economic status.  But, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I -- I don't know what else to say about w- what family would mean to me.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, well, um ... yeah.  Well, I think family is where it starts for the whole [NOISE] organizations of the world. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's true.  That's true.
L:  I think it begins there and what how -- whatever you experience there, you carry it out --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in the larger part of the world.
R:  That's absolutely true.  That's absolutely true.  Can -- some is --
L:  You know?
R:  Yes.  But --
L:  So, how you learn how to treat women in the family, you know?
R:  But that's true.  That's abso- --
L:  And how you are treated as a woman in the family.  That comes out in --
R:  That's definitely -- I definitely agree with that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because it does spread out to your other relationships.  If you weren't treated right as a child or you had, you know, um, someone put a -- pressed upon --
L:  And --
R:  -- emotional issues on you, you take that into the world and it spreads out.  I mean, I think about people I've --
L:  But I think -- yeah.  But -- but I think it does come back to the other way too.  The outs comes --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- um, and influences inwards.
R:  Yes.  Because how someone is raising their child or how their family, um, is can affect us, you know, in the community as well.
L:  W- -- yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  And just politics and media. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, you think that affects family relationships as well?
L:  Well, yeah.  I think so.  I mean, I remember my grandfather talking about TV getting in the way.  Just people don't -- they spend more time with their TV than they spend with each other.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or if they're watching -- I mean, it's like just passive relationships and -- I don't know.  Just watching the media and not really doting with each other and doting that, sort of, identity I guess --
R:  Yeah.  That --
L:  -- with each other.
R:  That c- -- that closeness getting to know your individual family members.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But do you think --
L:  And so they're just, kinda, like, walking around like you're a commercial and -- [LAUGH] I don't know.
R:  But do you think it has to do, sometimes, with economics too?  I mean, that comes to a place --
L:  Yeah.  Definitely.
R:  Because if you have two people working, it's very hard to come in, especially if the schedules are slightly different.  You know --
L:  If you have the -- if you -- i- it's like a challenge of making the time you have quality rather than --
R:  Right.  Right.  I mean, especially now you have kids into so many things.  And so --
L:  Yeah.  But then at the same time, it's like, sometimes things get so hard and then you -- so then it -- the thing is -- to do is just to get caught up with everything else and then --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You don't -- then it ruins, like, the quality and then when you have such little quantity --
R:  Yeah.  And it's hard to --
L:  So, it's like -- yeah.
R:  It's hard to --
L:  It's like --
R:  -- sit down and everybody be together at one time versus --
L:  Right.
R:  -- maybe, many years ago where you had one person working and then you have -- was the mom, usually, was the one at home.  I mean, sh- --
