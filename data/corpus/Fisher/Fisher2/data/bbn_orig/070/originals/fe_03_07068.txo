L:  Hi.  This is Renee.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Don't I have to [LAUGH] go through, ah, person one or two and three or four?  [NOISE] 
L:  I think you --
R:  Oh.
L:  Hello.
R:  My -- my wife dialed it up and I didn't know that she'd, ah --
L:  Oh.  I -- well, I'm on.  I think they're recording us now.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And we're supposed to talk about fam- --
L:  We're talking about -- right, what the word family means.  Well, I was down in the basement, speaking of family, and -- and my son sort of caught me, so I wasn't sure what was going on either, but [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- anyway.
R:  Well, maybe we can get on -- on the subject.  
L:  That would be fine.  Ah, what was your name?
R:  Eugene --
L:  Eugene?
R:  -- Michael.
L:  I'm Renee.  I didn't know if you heard that or not.
R:  No, I didn't.
L:  Um --
R:  But, um --
L:  -- do you have a family?
R:  Yes.  We have a daughter and three sons.
L:  How old are your children?
R:  Ah, makes me feel ancient, um --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- our daughter is fifty two.  We have a son fifty, we have a son that's forty six and one --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- that's forty four.
L:  Wow.  And I am fifty two.  But I have a son that's, um, ten, [LAUGH] so, we have a wide variation there, so I'm sure --
R:  Well --
L:  that, um, ah, things are different for kids growing up now, I think, than -- than --
R:  Well, I agree with you a hundred percent.
L:  Do you?  I wo- -- I wonder about that.  I remember from my perspective as a child, and [SIGH] -- and I don't know, but, I think --
R:  Well, as I tell people, ah, I'm glad I was born and raised when and where --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I was born and raised, because it's more difficult for, ah, young people nowadays than it was when I was growing up.
L:  Yeah.  So, you must be in your seventies then?
R:  I'm seventy five.
L:  Okay.  Yeah.  [SIGH] 
R:  And, ah, in other words, we had, ah, marijuana growing out in our pasture --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I didn't even know what the stuff was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- except my uncle told me, "Don't you remember, your dad said that the cows must have got into the loco weed".
L:  Uh, oh.
R:  And I said, "Ya, I remember that".  Well, he said, "It was that -- not a high grade marijuana but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- it was marijuana".
L:  Oh, that's interesting.
R:  And, [MN] very few of the, um, um, teenagers when I was growing up, ah, they -- very few of them smoked --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or even, ah, used alcoholic beverages.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that's why I say -- I was born and raised in Nebraska.
L:  Oh, you were?  That's interesting.
R:  Yeah.  And, ah, so --
L:  Do you live there now?  Is that where you're calling from?
R:  No.  I live in Oregon now.  I've lived here thirty six years.
L:  Wow.  That's interesting.
R:  Yeah.  Anyway, ah, I said another thing I was raised on a farm and, ah, w- we had too many w-, ah, chores to do to get in trouble.
L:  Yep.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yep. You know, that's why I think I try to keep my son, um, busy --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- as I can, because I do think that, ah, kids today just do have too much time on their hands, and --
R:  Really?
L:  Yes.  Yep.
R:  And -- oh --
L:  So, when you we- -- so, when you were raising your children, speaking of family, then you -- you had the traditional two parents, um, family?
R:  Yes.
L:  With your kids and -- and our family -- my family with my son is different, because his dad doesn't live with us, and -- and never has, so, um --
R:  Mm.  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, that's a different kind of family, but he's, you know -- and he thinks he's really different than everyone else and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- um, and there's a lot of that, but at the school where he goes, um, most of the kids there are two parent families, so it's -- it's hard --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- for him, and -- and [SIGH] I don't know, it- it's tough, but I tell him that everybody when they're growing up has one thing or another that you just have to -- to go through or deal with and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- unfortunately that's -- that's his.
R:  It's sure like that --
L:  So, is your family spread a- apart -- around the country?
R:  Well, we have, ah -- the oldest one is our daughter, she lives in Stockton[?], California --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- which is about four hundred miles from where we are.
L:  Right.
R:  And, ah, then we have two sons that live within a block of us --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then our middle son lives in Winatchi[?], Washington, and it's about five hundred miles from --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- where we are.
L:  Okay.  Well, are you on the coast of Oregon, or in the --
R:  We're about forty miles, as a crow would fly --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- from the coast.
L:  I would love to go to Oregon.  It just seems like a really beautiful --
R:  It i- --
L:  -- state.
R:  -- it really is.  Ah, and we're only about forty miles --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- no, not even that far, about twenty miles from the California line.
L:  My understanding is the gardening is wonderful in Oregon.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, it's -- the rhododendrons, azaleas, ah, this time of the year it's just, um, ah, well, beautiful.
L:  Yes.
R:  And the weather where we are is, ah, ah, that's one reason I'd rather -- don't live in Wan-, ah, live in Nebraska any more is because it gets cold in the winter --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and here it's -- I mean, it'll get down to freezing and -- and so on, but not that cold.
L:  Not like Nebraska.
R:  No.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- but, it, ah -- when it does get chilly here, it's bone -- it penetrates.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, because it's damp?
R:  It's damp.
L:  Yes.  
R:  But --
L:  We're having that kind of weather today, actually.
R:  You are?
L:  Oh, yes.  Ohi- -- I'm in Ohio.
R:  You're in Ohio?
L:  Yes.  And, I'm in Co- -- in Columbus, so that's the center of the state --
R:  Well --
L:  -- sort of in -- we're in a little valley, so [SIGH] a lot of the times in the summer the weather goes around us, or the rain, but it seems like in the spring we get so much rain --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and today it was only, I think, probably in the sixties and dreary and cold and --
R:  Right.  Well --
L:  -- just not June weather.
R:  -- ah, I had a uncle that lived in Springfield --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- Kyle --
L:  Right.
R:  -- he was a motorcycle policeman, but he's been dead a number of years --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, anyway --
L:  Wha- --
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] ah, we're having if we talk about family, we're having two family reunions.  One in Nebraska on June the twenty second on my side of the family --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and then on my wife's side of the family we're having a family reunion on July third, fourth and fifth at [inaudible] Park, Colorado.
L:  Wow.
R:  So --
L:  So, you'll be going back to D- -- to Nebraska?
R:  Yes.
L:  How many people will be at the -- at each reunion approximately?
R:  Oh, it's ha- -- I don't know, probably around forty, fifty.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Ah --
L:  Do you do that at -- every year, or ...?
R:  We used to, but, um, since, ha, ah, we're all -- we've all gotten older, especially cousins and so on --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that, um, it gets to -- ah, well, you slow down.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, I know, I'm slowing down at my [LAUGH] -- my age, so it's like, "Oh, dear".  
R:  Yep.
L:  I can see that.  We used to have reunions -- hello --
R:  Hello.
L:  Can you hear me?
R:  Yes, I can hear you.
L:  Okay.
R:  Can you hear me?
L:  Yeah.  I can.
R:  Okay.
L:  It's clicking.  It must be winding down. 
R:  Oh.
L:  Have you done one of these before?
R:  Yes.
L:  This is my second one.  It's been a while.  I didn't think they'd still call me, but --
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, this -- this is my second one.
L:  I really e- enjoy it.  It's nice to talk to people from different walks of life and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and from far away too.
R:  Yes.
L:  The last time the person I spoke to was in, um, Kentucky, and I thought well, maybe they try to keep you regionalized or something --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but apparently that's not the case.
R:  Well, my wife got me involved in this.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Did she?  D- --
R:  I told her, "No".  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  She says, "It's fun.  Go ahead and try it". 
L:  Is sh- -- so, she's doing it --
R:  Well, I tried it and I liked it.  [LAUGH]
L:  She's done it too then?
R:  Yes.
L:  Ah.  Well, I think it is pretty neat.  Well, before they cut us off.  I don't know -- I did want to tell you, "Have a nice time at your reunion".  I think that's --
R:  Well --
L:   -- a nice thing to do, and, um, our family used to do that when I was growing up.  I had like forty cousins and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I don't even see them now.  It's just --
R:  Right.
L:  -- sort of sad.  
R:  See, that's the thing --
L:  And we're all in the -- we're all around in Columbus, that's the thing.
R:  Well, is that right?
L:  Yes.
R:  What I found out is n- nowadays families scatter from one end of the country to the other --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when I was growing up, families -- I mean, I had a lot of cousins and -- and, ah, nieces and nephews and stuff like that, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we used to have picnics and so on, but then we all scattered.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Um --
L:  Well, it sounds like your family's fairly close to you though, so that's --
R:  Our children are, yes.
L:  Yes.
R:  Ah --
L:  Yes.  And that's good. --
