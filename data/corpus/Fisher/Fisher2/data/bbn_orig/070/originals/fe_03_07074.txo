R:  Hello.
L:  Hello, this is Sheila.
R:  Hi, my name is Joe, [inaudible].
L:  Have you done this before?
R:  No, I haven't --
L:  Um.
R:  -- my wife was doing it and, ah, said it was quite interesting.
L:  Yeah, I finally have done one but I must admit it was on, ah, airport security and although I have never been in an airport I found all kind of things to talk about [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] That -- that's --
L:  -- but, um, family, what your family means to -- to you, now that --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- could --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- could go a whole lot of ways I guess.  [LAUGH]
R:  Wow, yeah, yeah.  I -- i- it's actually in- -- you know, an interesting topic, I do a lot of counseling with families, so I could see what happens when family and --
L:  Oh great.
R:  -- isn't taken seriously and -- and, you know, I see a lot of families in crisis, um, you know.
L:  Well, good then, 'cause you may have a whole lot of stuff --
R:  Well --
L:  -- lots to bring up here 'cause that --
R:  Well --
L:  -- that might work out really good.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I, you know, it's funny when you -- when you say family, you know, when -- when does family start, does family start when -- when people get married?  Does family start when, you know, you -- you -- you start having kids?
L:  Yeah, that's what I was thinking when they said that, I thought, well are they talking about your family in your home or --
R:  [LAUGH] Right, right.
L:  -- all those in laws, you know.
R:  Ah, it can mean extended family too, I mean, singles who have family [LAUGH] so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, g- -- so, you know, I -- I guess fundamentally you're talking about a group of people but, um, yeah, there are some people who I think, ah, you know, ah, have friends who are more like family than family.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  So family can take on a whole other dimension I think, then.
L:  Yeah, because friends a lot of times, though, understand and be a little more compassionate maybe than, ah, people that are in your family might.
R:  Right, that's right.
L:  You don't have as much tension, I guess.
R:  Right, so I -- I, you know, you think about it, you know, just to think about d- defining family, family's are, I think, got to be, you know, obviously people who you feel who are close --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and that may not necessarily m- -- you know, imply, you know, blood relatives.  You know, family can mean, you know, people who are close, who are friends, who aren't necessarily related and, you know, who we take as family.
L:  Yeah, may I ask, you said you counsel a lot of people, is this through a job?
R:  I'm a clinical psychologist and, ah --
L:  Okay, wow.
R:  -- and, ah, you know, I -- I work also as a school psychologist and I -- I run a large group practice and, ah, do a lot of lecturing and I serve as an adjunct professor, so I do a number of things and, ah, I -- I just thought this sounded interesting for ten minutes e- --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- even though I spend my day talking I can [LAUGH] [inaudible].
L:  Well, that just sounds very, very fascinating to me, because I'm j- -- I'm just a stay at home mom and all but, so, that sounds really great.
R:  Uh-huh.  I res- -- I really do respect that, I -- couple of nights a week I'm home and -- with my kids, I have three and, ah, that, you know, to me, that's when I learn what family is as well.  I mean, I, you know -- I deal with families all day for the most part and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and a couple of nights a week and, ah, when I'm home being a dad, you know, that's a -- a, you know, that's when I really get to --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- to -- to identify and understand what that means, and I mean in terms of what, you know, our respective roles are as --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- parents, you know, and -- and I certainly have a whole other appreciation for the whole word being with, you know, family, making a family work is -- is a lot of work.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Um, well, I don't know -- I know that a lot of the things, I think about a traditional family and I know that, like, you say, today, that -- that can mean a whole lot of different things --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- and I -- I'm -- a lot of times I worry because in one way we're getting away from the mom and dad home --
R:  Right.
L:  -- type family, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I -- I think that, you know, a strong marriage and -- and good kids like that, that makes -- makes a whole lot --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of help in -- in how your family runs.
R:  Yeah, absolutely.
L:  I know my husband, ah, is, a judicial commissioner and so when people have problems they -- they go to him --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- wanting warrants against each other a l- -- especially on who's got the kids and if somebody's not --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- going by the rules or doing, you know, what they think they're supposed to be doing, so he --
R:  Right.
L:  -- gets to hear a lot of that --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- too, on a different level.
R:  [MN] Yeah, yeah.  I -- I think you know, wha- what you said before was very accurate, I think that when you -- when you talk about family and you -- you talk about how, you know, people take that, or don't take it seriously, that we've seen such big changes in -- in what families are for people and -- and I think that, you know, unfortunately, I don't know if it's a generational thing, but there seems to be a lack of -- of -- of genuine, um, acknowledgement of what be- -- you know, being a family means -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for many people and, ah, you know, for some, you know, their senses are, you know, you have kids, but, you know, you let other people raise them and [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, and -- and obviously, you know, that's -- that's no ideal situation, I mean, there are some people who certainly have to work but, ah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, either, you know, having -- spending more time, you know, dealing with your own personal stuff and not giving your time to your kids, because being a family requires a lot of energy and I think it requires a tremendous amount of -- of consistency and sincerity and, ah, and gen- -- and genuine involvement.
L:  Yeah, you know, we had often said when our children were younger that it's a lot more work making them, ah -- correcting them, making sure they're i- in line like they should, it'd be a whole lot easier just to, ah, let it go wouldn't it?
R:  Right.
L:  But it takes a lot more work --
R:  Right.
L:  -- stepping in sometimes and explaining to them [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- why they shouldn't do what they're doing or whatever.  [LAUGH]
R:  A- absolutely.  Abso- -- and I think if you're going to -- if you're going to make a family work there's going to be a lot of that stepping in and there's going to be a lot of teaching.  You know, a lot of people, a lot of friends I know, when they come, you know, for help, you know, whether it be through -- through me or one of my associates or any psychologist for that matter, you know, a lot of times they wonder, "What's going to happen, doc?"  You know, I just let them lay on the couch and that kind of -- and I say --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- "No, look, I don't, you know, that's not how I practice this", you know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "This is about -- this is about trying to work together, to problem solve".  But a big part of it is teaching skills and many times I find myself, you know, teaching very, you know -- very basic types of strategies for parents so that they can have a better family --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, because they don't -- they don't really know what family is, they never really learned what it was like to have, you know, loving, caring, consistent parents --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- little, I mean, it- it's unbelievable, and of course, having kids and -- and, you know -- and -- and being, you know, married now, it's -- it's certainly -- it gives me a greater, ah, o- opportunity certainly to really teach what family is to so many people who don't know what it is.  We take it for granted if you've come from a good family --
L:  I know.
R:  -- and you raise a family, an- and I find that to be always interesting.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I was very fortunate to have a -- a good -- good home and good parents and everything, um, my whole life, it -- well, I still do --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, ah, [MN] when -- when you see some of the stuff coming across the TV --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I don't se- -- look at much, but what little I see, I thought, "Man, that don't -- that don't look like anything like what I'm raised with".  [LAUGH] 
R:  R- right.  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  You know, that's -- that's not what family and growing up was, and I guess for a lot of people, some of this stuff is the reality --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it's scary.
R:  Ah, well, yeah, it is.  Sometimes when I -- when I have g- -- trying to give people a sense as to their role, and they don't even know what their role in the family should be, I mean I --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I would really talk, I would say, "Look, you know what?  I want you to -- here's your assignment.  I want you to watch a -- a few reruns.  I want you to watch the Brady Bunch --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I want you to watch Leave it to Beaver", and I'd say, "Yeah, it's all Hollywood and what not, but you know what, there's a certain message that's conveyed".  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And if you sit and you out -- and you -- and you really were to put, you know, analyze Carole and Mike Brady, you got two people who theoretically reflective of what we see today a lot, you know, surrogate families --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- coming together and joining, but working collaboratively.  You notice the consistency between those two?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Now, I know it -- you know, it's Hollywood, it's -- it's the sixties, it's a different generation, but what's -- what's important is that both parents are obviously, regardless of their career or whatever, you know, the architect, or whatever, they're committed to working through problems.
L:  Those kids, right.
R:  So, I mean, an- and I don't think that they're -- I mean, I know it again it's Hollywood, I understand and all, and it's -- you know, it's contrived, but the message is, "If you're going to be part of a family, if you're going to make a family work, you have to be involved".  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you have to be involved, and you have to be consistent.  And it's -- it's a heck of a lot easier if you have a mother and a father, a husband and wife, who work together and have that same idea about what a family should be.
L:  Right.  That's funny you mentioned that, 'cause I've got a eleven year old and he, ah -- he's turns into TV land, I guess it's one of the [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  -- you know, he's into that, so, ah --
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- bef- before our time runs out, ah, I happen to sign up on this for -- through Refunding Makes Sense, what did your wife happen to sign up?  Do you know?
R:  You know, I don't recall -- when did she sign up?
L:  Or -- or where from?  How did she get into this?
R:  You know, I don't know.  She's been involved with a whole bunch of stuff on the internet --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and she discovered this one -- I don't -- I have to ask her actually.  I don't really know how she found it.
L:  Oh, I wasn't sure, do both, ah, ah, ah, couples get to do that maybe through another phone number, 'cause I told my husband, I said, "You know, you could probably do that". 
R:  Yeah, you know what?  I think that, you know, if you have different phone numbers that, ah --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know, there may be opportunities to do it.
L:  I think so.  Well, I was -- didn't know -- I wouldn't sign up for a long time because I'm so backwards I -- I don't talk, I -- you know I'm -- I'm just so [LAUGH] --
R:  Well, you fooled me.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I know, well, it amazed me because I got my first call and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- she -- it was a lady and it was the airport thing, and I thought, "Oh, no, I've never been in an airport" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but I thought of so many security issues, and we just had a blast, so, ah --
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Yeah, you know --
L:   -- I tell him I have come out of myself a little bit, so this was a good thing, and --
R:  Well, yeah.  It's a good -- it's a good exercise for you to do.  [LAUGH] When my wife said --
L:  Especially when you get money for it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, there you go.  You know, the time goes very quickly, I mean, and that's, ah, you know, I'm still trying to understand the nature of the study.  I know it's out of UPenn, but I- I'm trying -- [LAUGH] I can't help --
L:  Well, my husband said it's probably some federal grant and, ah --
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  -- they're studying information --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know.
R:  Well, ah, imagine that, your opinion actually means something for somebody.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  That's good.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I wouldn't kind of, when I -- I dive there, 'cause I don't know how you feel and all, but when I talk about the traditional family, what we're calling now a man marrying a man and this kind of --
