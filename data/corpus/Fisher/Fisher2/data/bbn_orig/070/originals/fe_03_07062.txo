R:  Hi.  This is Diane.
L:  [PAUSE] Hi.  This is Patricia.
R:  Oh, hi.  Where are -- where do you live Patricia?
L:  I'm in California.  Sorry --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  This is the first one I've done so [LAUGH] --
R:  This is the first one I've done too so [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, good. [LAUGH]
R:  And --
L:  We can learn together. [LAUGH]
R:  I'm calling from Minnesota.
L:  Oh, wow.  You're way out there.
R:  Yes.  Okay.  So, our topic today is family.  Right?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay.  Well, I have a lot of family.  I have tons of family around.
L:  So do I.
R:  Hm.  Good.  W- well, we have something in common there.  I grew up in this area and my family is all, pretty much, close by.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I have some relatives -- some close -- a sister in Alabama and a brother in Georgia but, um, other than that, they all live in Minneapolis, which is just short ways from me, or Red Wing, or in town.  And, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  So, family -- family's very important.  Family keeps me very busy.  I have six siblings and, ah, I have three children of my own.
L:  I've got four.
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] good.  Good.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And are you in the area you grew up in?
L:  I've actually traveled quite a bit with my family.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We, um [LIPSMACK] -- we've lived in Iowa ... where else?  Germany --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  New Mexico -- we've traveled.  My, um, older brothers and sister were in the air force.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, we got to travel.  But we just had our family reunion this weekend and we had people from Oklahoma come out.
R:  Wow.  Where was your family reunion?
L:  We had it, um, out in Fresno here in California.
R:  Okay.
L:  But, um, my mom's originally from Oklahoma.
R:  Oh, okay.  Ah --
L:  And then they came out here when she was pretty young.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Somehow than -- somehow or another, most of us migrated this way. [LAUGH]
R:  Are your parents still living?
L:  My mother is.  I don't know anything about my father.
R:  Okay.  So, was your mother out there for the reunion?
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  Well, that's neat.  Do you have any other siblings?
L:  I have --
R:  Right.
L:  -- two older brothers, an older sister and a younger sister.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Okay.  So, that's a pretty large family too.
L:  Oh, yeah.  We're pretty close.
R:  Well, that's neat.  How old are your kids?
L:  See, my oldest will turn fifteen in August --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and then I have a thirteen year old year, a seven year old girl and then the baby -- she's two.
R:  Oh.  That sounds like fun.  Boy, you're busy.
L:  Oh -- oh, yes. [LAUGH]
R:  You are very busy.
L:  My oldest is a boy and he's something else. [LAUGH]
R:  Is he?  Yep.  He's getting to be that age isn't he? [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  He's talking about driving now. [SIGH]
R:  Oh, wow.  Oh, that begins a whole new world for you.  That will --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- be exciting.
L:  I told him -- I said, "When you're twenty five you may drive".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  He says, "Well, Mother, I didn't appreciate that".  I said, "No.  But everybody else does". [LAUGH]
R:  R- right. [LAUGH] I remember when our oldest son got his drivers license.  I s- -- told him he couldn't drive anywhere except on city streets.  You could not go on the highway.  Well, I live in -- it's a pretty small town here -- maybe twenty six thousand -- but you don't get anywhere without going on the highway.  And I thought, "Well, I really limited him".
L:  Oh, but that's such a good thing.  I don't know how anybody can handle that.
R:  Handle what?
L:  Them learning to drive.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you handle a lotta things.
L:  I feel really sorry for my mother. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I think you just learn to do it as -- as they get there but, ah -- yeah.  My kids are all older now.  My son's twenty seven -- my oldest son's twenty seven and I have a twenty four year old son.  My twenty seven year old lives in the same town and works -- he's out of school and -- out of college and he's working in this town.  And I have a twenty five year -- almost twenty five year old living in North Dakota going to school.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And I have a twenty two year old daughter going to school.  So -- in Platteville, Wisconsin.  But she's home --
L:  Oh, they're scattered.
R:  They're scattered.  She's home for the summer and so th- -- so that's been nice.  Yes.  And, ah -- yep. [LAUGH] And I h- -- I have, ah, a sister that lives in Red Wing, which is really close by, maybe a -- a r- --
L:  Where at?
R:  -- half hour -- Redwing, Minnesota.
L:  Okay.
R:  Have you heard of that?
L:  I thought you said Redding.
R:  Red Wing.  Yup.  And her daughters are very close to me too.  I was just saying today to somebody about since there's so much extended family, my life is very, very busy.  When I --
L:  There -- I've -- I've noticed there is a lot of extended families now.
R:  There is.  There is.  Um, I know one of the girls I work with has just herself and her stepparent -- one -- a step dad and her mom and one sister and really, no nieces, doesn't have any cousins by and I thought, "Oh, my goodness".
L:  Oh, I couldn't stand that.
R:  No.  And when I -- I said, "These are the people I all need to stay in contact with" and I'll show her a picture of our family with all the siblings and all the kids that -- a picture we took from our parents' anniversary and she's, like, "Oh, my gosh.  What a different life". [LAUGH]
L:  And it really is.
R:  It is.  It is.
L:  And we seem to multiply every year. [LAUGH]
R:  Don't I know it.  I know it.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And, ah, yep, I'd say my sisters are probably some of my better friends and my kids -- I'm close to all the kids.  That's been --
L:  Did you stay home with them when they were growing up?
R:  H- -- did I stay home?  Yes, I -- I was home for quite a few years.  Um, I'm a teacher so I was home until they were five and then I returned to just some evening teaching and I did not return a- -- well, I'm still not teaching fulltime so I guess I never did return again.  Um, m- -- part time teacher.  But -- yes.  I was home with them all the time.  I never did the daycare thing.
L:  Yeah.  I stay with mine too.  I work on the web now --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- so that I can.
R:  Oh, good.
L:  Were you --
R:  That's you found out about this, huh?
L:  Yes it is.
R:  Oh, I guess we're supposed to talk family.  My daughter signed me up.
L:  Well, we, um -- I do a -- a kids' site online.
R:  Oh, you do?  What's that?
L:  It's w- -- they come in and -- and we make it as safe as possible for 'em but they come in and they can earn points for -- to win auction items and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they get door prizes and they can play and they just have a lot of fun but a- -- but be safe on the web.
R:  Good.  Good for you.
L:  So, it's -- it's pretty neat.
R:  How --
L:  But then I've got -- I'm home all day with the kids and they all get out at different times so I'm always here for 'em.
R:  That's good.  Now, why are your kids getting out at different times?
L:  I've got one in high school --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- one in junior high --
R:  Ah --
L:  -- and one in elementary. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, wow.  And they don't -- school doesn't end at the same time?
L:  No.  Not out here.  In fact, my two oldest -- my two oldest are finally on a traditional school year and they're getting out tomorrow.  That'll be their last day for the summer.  But my youngest -- my second to youngest one is on, what they call, year round.  So, she goes three months, gets out a month.
R:  Well, do you like that?
L:  [NOISE] I, kinda, do and don't.  But when I had all three kids in elementary --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they were all on different tracks so it, kind of --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- was hard to schedule anything.
R:  Right.
L:  But now, she's get- -- this will be her last year in -- in -- in the year round and then she's gonna go on to the traditional.
R:  Okay.
L:  But now that I'm so not used to having them all for three months straight. [LAUGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh.
L:  So, that's gonna be quite a interesting thing.
R:  Yeah.  It -- and it's amazing how quickly you'll get used to it.
L:  Yeah.  I'm just amazed at how fast they've grown up.
R:  Isn't it something?  I know.  I can't believe it.  Can't believe my kids got to be so old [LAUGH] so quickly.
L:  It's so fast.
R:  I know.  I know it.  It's fast.
L:  My son calls me and says, "Mom, I want for my fifteenth birthday ..."  I said, "Your what?"
R:  Oh.
L:  No. [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  But you know what?  Even though they grow up fast, I think there isn't really any age I would wanna go back to of the -- of the children because I like them this age too.
L:  Well, my mom says that we may -- we may have been grown up but we are still her [NOISE] babies.
R:  That's right.  And I think you stay that way forever.  It's -- it's amazing.  My mom lives in the same town and I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- she's, probably, almost eighty now, but I watch her worry about all of us and I said, "Doesn't it ever go away?"
L:  And my mom says --
R:  And she said, "No." [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  My mom does the same thing.  My oldest brother was forty three when he finally moved out.
R:  Oh, no. [LAUGH]
L:  But he took care of her.  He lived --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- on his own and then he'd come home and take care of her.  She was just [NOISE] diagnosed with cancer --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- not too long ago.  Well, they got -- they got it out.
R:  Good.  Good.
L:  So, she's okay but then this last year's been so hard on her.
R:  Mhm.
L:  She lost her sister -- the one that w- -- she was the closest to.
R:  Sure.
L:  And then, um, my nineteen year old nephew was killed e- -- back in January and --
R:  Oh.  Oh.
L:  -- she had strokes and it's just -- it's been really hard but she's finally getting there.  So, he sticks close by to keep an eye on her.
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  Well, he's the only one that doesn't have too much family right now.  The rest of us are married and got kids and he's -- he's just got the one son now.
R:  Okay.  So, he was married once or ...?
L:  Yeah.  He was.  His son is the one that -- that passed away here in January and --
R:  Oh, my.  Oh.
L:  So, he needs Mommy right now and --
R:  Oh.  Yeah.
L:  -- he takes care of her.
R:  Oh.
L:  But we're -- we're surviving it.  It's just --
R:  Did --
L:  -- it never happens to you.
R:  I know.  Well, it's not supposed to --
L:  Um, I guess.
R:  -- but guess what? [MN]
L:  Yeah.
R:  It does doesn't it?
L:  It just seems -- you know, when my aunt -- aunt passed away, my mom's [NOISE] sister, that was -- no yelling please -- you know, that was one thing.  She was seventy something, so she had lived a full life.
R:  Yeah.  But still, that's young isn't it?
L:  Yeah.  It is.  But he was nineteen.
R:  That is terrible.
L:  You know, his whole life's ahead of him and he was just, in a heartbeat, taken away.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, we're -- we're dealing with that and --
R:  Oh.
L:  I tell you this, it wasn't for Mom, I don't think my brother could've survived it.
R:  Oh.  Oh, that's -- that's -- that's really sad.
L:  Yeah.  But family is a wonderful thing.  I have to agree with that.
R:  Yep.  Yep.  It's the best.  I -- I've decided that I'm a very family centered person.  When they say, "What -- what is your, um, [LIPSMACK] deciding --" oh, what do we say?  Ah, how do you make your decisions in life or what do you decide?  And I think, "Always with family in mind".  It's always there.  That's where I am.  I'm very grounded in family.
L:  And that's the same thing here.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's -- that's a good way to be.
L:  No sweetie.  No.  No.
R:  I think it's good.  So, what took you out to California from Oklahoma?
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Well, you said you've been all over the pl- --
