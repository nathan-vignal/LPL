L:  Hello.  My name is Brandy.
R:  Hi.  My name's Anna.  How are you?
L:  I'm fine.
R:  That's good. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Last survey I got the person didn't answer the phone. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-oh. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Sometimes that's me. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Um --
L:  Kids are screaming or something.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, family, well, m- -- ah, I don't even know where to start.  Um, very important.
L:  Yes.
R:  Um, don't know what you'd do without 'em. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Exactly.
R:  Um, ah, most of my family lives right close by.  Um, we're rather close.  Um, I think that it's -- I don't know where to [LAUGH] start -- really, where to start.
L:  Oh, I know.  Well, I'm, um -- I'm a stay at home mom of two.  I have a three year old daughter and a eight month old daughter.  And my husband works and I stay at home with kids.  So, ah, family to me is everything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's just, ah -- that's my life.  My mom lives about two hours away and -- and so I don't get to see her a whole lot and, um, really, I don't have a whole lotta family close to me.  So, it -- this is my --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- m- -- that's what --
R:  Well, I'm a stay at home mom also.  My daughter is two years old.  My son is twelve.
L:  W- wow.
R:  Um, my father lives with me -- or, he lives here on the property with me.  Um, my husband, he's a long distance truck driver but he's been injured in a accident so he's home with me.  Um, [NOISE] so, family does seem very important and, ah, we try to keep close to everyone.  His parents stay about, [SIGH] um, forty five minutes from us.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, my mom, she stays -- my mom and dad are divorced but she stays, um, just, like, two miles on the other side of town from me.
L:  Oh, wow.  That's something --
R:  And everybody gets along, you know, uncannily, really well to -- to be from a divorced family.
L:  Right.  That's good.
R:  And, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  We try to stay close and do things together on holidays and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- with most of our grandparents being -- well, my grandparents are gone, both of 'em and, ah -- on both sides.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  So, um, I try to keep my parents close and keep them -- I've pretty much taken over control -- taking care of them because with their mom and dad both being gone, I know when it comes mother's day, father's day and Christmas and stuff like that, they get real sad.
L:  Right.
R:  And I'm always there trying to keep them going and -- and keep things going for them.
L:  That's good.
R:  But, um --
L:  So, we both, kind of, um, our [LAUGH] -- we live for our families. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Uh -- uh-huh.
R:  Um, my hus- -- I was working while -- when I was pregnant --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and my husband said, "No.  The stress is just too high, come home.  I want you to be at home with the family and do y- -- the things that you have to do here".
L:  Right.
R:  He said that you don't need to go through that.  You need to be here --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- taking care of the family.  He believes family's first.  He --
L:  Right.
R:  And he -- he's wanted me to be at home to raise our daughter and -- and not stick her in a daycare situation and --
L:  That's exactly [LAUGH] how my husband is.
R:  So --
L:  We agreed before we ever had kids that --
R:  Well, it's a struggle at times but --
L:  I agree.
R:  -- we've been, you know -- we've been doing it -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  it's difficult at times, you know, when the money gets tight but --
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  But we both -- we -- we struggle through it and h- he looks at it -- he has -- he has to stop and think and he -- he says, "I don't want my little girl out there".  He said, "There's too many things going on.  Too many things that people can do to hurt you".
L:  That's right.
R:  And he said, "You just don't even think about it".  He said, "That's why I prefer to have her home --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- have you home with her".
L:  Right.
R:  I said, "Well, you ain't got to worry about that".
L:  No.  Yeah.
R:  'Cause I'll be here.
L:  Don't mind a bit. [LAUGH]
R:  I'll be right here.  I picked up trying to do Tupperware on the side to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to supplement some --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- stuff and help out.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  And I've just gotten started with that so it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- rather slow.  And with my husband being home, he's pretty much took over doing a lot of stuff --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- around the house other than, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- as far as bills --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and stuff like that.  He's trying to get back --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in touch with things that he was not in charge of while he was on the road.
L:  Right.
R:  So --
L:  I get ya.
R:  But, to both of us, i- -- family's really important.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It --
L:  [NOISE] Oh, same. [NOISE] See, my -- my, um, [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] husband came from a [LIPSMACK] -- oh, lord.  His family was just really -- he was just sent [NOISE] here and sent [NOISE] there as a small child.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause he came from divorced parents. [NOISE] And so, one of his biggest convictions was to be a good dad and have a good family for his kids.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And so, he's [NOISE] [LAUGH] -- she's going crazy.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Sydney --
R:  That happens.  I walked out --
L:  Hush.  I'm on the phone. [LAUGH]
R:  I walked out of the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- room and went to the [LAUGH] bathroom --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to keep away from all of them. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  They have the --
L:  T- --
R:  -- TV wide open in the other room so I have --
L:  Well, she's playing with the baby and she -- she's --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- trying to make her laugh. [LAUGH] 
R:  Ah.
L:  T- -- screaming at her. [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh.  I'm cooking supper [NOISE] so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  These phone calls are always there on supper time.
L:  I was [NOISE] --
R:  Always during the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that --
L:  Y- --
R:  -- time frame.
L:  [NOISE] I think -- yes. [NOISE] Me too.
R:  And it's just -- I -- I didn't think about it.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  My husband tried to schedule them on the day --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that I'd be home and -- and that could take it without a problem.
L:  So, do you get a lot of 'em?
R:  Well --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I've gotten -- so far, since --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I've started back this time, I've gotten three but one of -- you're my second --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- one 'cause the -- the one before you, no one ever come back on the line.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've had, ah -- they've called several times when I weren't home --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because my husband forgets and we go to town and go --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- do something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I miss the call.
L:  Oh --
R:  But --
L:  Well, it's -- do you go check, um, [NOISE] the website or whatever?  I'm new to it so --
R:  I haven't yet.  I've got to check it because I was just telling my husband a while ago, I said --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- "You know, they never did pay me for the last one".  I found that the last time -- and we're supposed to do three calls and I did one because something happened --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and the other --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- two I never did receive and they called me --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- one time and I never --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- got the other two calls.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I was supposed to get at least a ten dollar check --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for the first -- for the first call.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I never got it.
L:  Well, where's the website?  What is the website?
R:  Oh, god.  I'd have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to look it up.  Um, do you have a pen --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- where you could email me?
L:  Yes.
R:  And I'll -- I'll look it up and -- and forward it to you.
L:  Okay.
R:  Okay.  It's Y.A.P.P.E.R.
L:  Y.A.P.P.E.R.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yapper.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  At I.N.T.R.
L:  I.N.T.R.
R:  S.T.A.R.
L:  S. --
R:  -- dot net --
L:  -- T.A. -- intrastar dot net?
R:  Right.
L:  I.N.T.R.S.T.A.R. dot net?
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay.
R:  And just -- just put phone survey and that way I'll know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- who you are.
L:  Okay.
R:  And you email me first and I'll, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, to remind me --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I'll get on their tonight and I'll look it up because --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- um, there's been several people --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that's been asking about it.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  A few people, I've heard --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- got their checks but I didn't never get my first one.
L:  Well, I -- I signed up on it -- it was, kind of, a happened upon it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- type thing and I didn't bookmark it and I was like, "Okay". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause I've done -- completed one call and I was, like, "Oh, where do I go back and check [LAUGH] it out?" [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, I --
L:  Ah --
R:  -- completed -- I've completed one and yours would be the second.
L:  This is my second also. [NOISE]
R:  And -- but the -- the one that I received last week, whoever it was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- never did come on the line.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  'Cause a lotta people --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- sign up to do this from work --
L:  [NOISE] Shh.
R:  And they -- they may be busy --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- at the time.  'Cause I know my fir- -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- one of my calls I got online --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- with somebody or got on --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the phone with someone --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and they were at work.
L:  Oh, my. [NOISE]
R:  And they had to keep --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- putting me on hold --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and to answer.  But, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the survey --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is a real help with -- ah, or the website was, kind of, helpful because it gave me a list of surveys --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that you could --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- expect some topics.
L:  Oh, I hadn't seen that. [NOISE]
R:  It doesn't tell you what order --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you'll receive 'em but it gave you an idea.
L:  Oh, okay.  That's neat.
R:  So, you could think of it.  Um, but, I was like, "Whoa". [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Some of the topics, like, ah -- I don't know anything about that. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, I know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, family is -- ah, it's a good one for me 'cause --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- family is -- is just -- that's my life.  That's everything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That about --
R:  Because you --
L:  -- sums it up. [LAUGH]
R:  Without them --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you wouldn't have anything.
L:  That --
R:  I couldn't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I couldn't tell you the number --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of times my family's come --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- through for me --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and been there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean, as --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- far babysitting or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- run to town --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- when I can't go to town --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or my car's broke down --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- my family comes through for me.  Um --
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  If dependab- -- you got -- you c- -- with family, you know you got dependability.
L:  That's right.
R:  You don't have to worry about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, like you would with a friend.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Sometimes, you have a -- a close friend --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but they're only --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a close friend, it seems --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- when they need something.
L:  Yes.
R:  And --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But with family --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they're not that way.
L:  That's right.
R:  They're here all the time.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And if you're having a bad day --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you can pick up the phone and you can give 'em a call and you can boo hoo all day long --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- with 'em.  And they'll listen.
L:  It's that unconditional love that's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that always pulls through.
R:  And a lotta times you don't -- a lot of things I did not realize and did not understand until I got a family of my own.
L:  Oh, yeah.  That's so true. [NOISE]
R:  And I could n- -- I can -- it's funny, I could hear myself saying things that my mother said to me.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  And --
L:  Oh, me too. [LAUGH]
R:  I s- --
