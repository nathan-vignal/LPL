L:  Hi, I'm ... Donna.  [SIGH]
R:  Hi, Donna, I'm Tom Kennedy.  [SIGH]
L:  I live in Grants Pass, Oregon.
R:  [SIGH]  Ah, down in Grants Pass.  I'm up in Portland right now.
L:  Oh, you are.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh.  Hm.  [SIGH]  And so we're supposed to talk on [SIGH] ... w- what?  [LAUGH]
R:  I think it, ah, has to do with, ah, corporate behavior in the US and then, if remember +correctly, ah, [SIGH] -- correctly, um, [MN] something about the illegal behavior -- illegal corporate behavior.
L:  Oh, would that be [NOISE] like, ah, what's going on with Martha Stewart and her, [SIGH] ah, company?  [SIGH]
R:  You know, I think -- I think so and I know that there's been a couple [SIGH] recent headlines that -- that I have not read [SIGH] the exact thing.  I think she was ... indicted.  [SIGH]  And it was --
L:  Yes, she was.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, a- and, ah, what do you think about that?
L:  [SIGH]  Well, [SIGH] I think ... she -- she's probably guilty but [SIGH] there's ... been other people that, ah, -- [SIGH] ah, that, ah, have done worse things than she [SIGH] h- has done and [SIGH] they don't, ah -- [SIGH] and they don't get as much publicity as she's been getting.
R:  I -- I totally agree with that.  I think that she because of her [SIGH] public -- [SIGH] she's a public persona and for some reason [SIGH] they've chosen her to be the s- scapegoat for [SIGH] a lot of other things that's going on that they aren't [SIGH] -- they aren't +prosecuting -- they aren't clamping down on --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and -- and what's r- really makes me sad about it is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [MN] is that most of -- all of this bad activity, these -- these bad corporate criminals are men [SIGH] and then they pick a w- woman to be the poster child.  [SIGH]
L:  That's what I was thinking too.  [SIGH]  Hm.
R:  And that -- that is such a raw deal.  [SIGH]
L:  It is.  Uh-hum.
R:  And, ah, [SIGH] you know, she got caught up in a game of being [SIGH] kind of privy to some of this information and [SIGH] the whole system it seemed [SIGH] to me with all this, ah, rewarding of stock options [SIGH] --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- is at a certain point [SIGH] for you to benefit from that system you have to cash out.  [SIGH]
L:  R- right.
R:  And I think that's kind of what she was doing was she was cashing out.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Um, and I -- I spent a [SIGH] -- a number of years living in Houston, Texas --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- and that's the home of Enron.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, yes.
R:  And though- those -- those guys are r- really crooked.  They are -- they've given [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they've given tons of money to, [SIGH] ah, -- to the current administration in campaign donations.  [SIGH]  They've gotten [SIGH] their -- their executives appointed to [SIGH] positions in -- in the government.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  And so they're -- they're [SIGH] -- and they're just -- they're cheaters.  They're -- they, ah, [SIGH] um, had these rules that even when the stock was crashing because their top guys were cashing out --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [SIGH] that the employees that were vested in the thrift plan they couldn't sell theirs.  [SIGH]
L:  Right.
R:  And it -- it's just like what do you do with these people?  [MN]
L:  Right.  [SIGH]  And h- here they had, [SIGH] ah, [SIGH] they were ... millionaires many times over and had these very expensive houses, [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- in all parts of the United States.  [SIGH]  And, um, [SIGH] I -- I remember hearing the one that was in, um, [SIGH] Colorado, up at Aspen.
R:  Yes.
L:  And [SIGH] I felt, wow, here [SIGH] -- the people that have invested in it [SIGH] their life savings and they're gone and he is benefiting from [SIGH] that.  [SIGH]  And they aren't getting any benefit from it.
R:  [COUGH]  Yeah, I totally agree and I think that that's, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] [MN] it's really stealing [SIGH] but they do it in a way where they technically have rules in their favor.
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  And so s- supposedly [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's not illegal to do [SIGH] so they can do it but -- [SIGH] but that, -- ah, that stuff is, ah, [SIGH] -- I mean they -- they should be -- it -- it's funny 'cause I'm -- [SIGH] I'm doing my best to be a pacifist but I feel like those guys should be lined up and shot.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, they should, ah, [SIGH] be, ah, -- [SIGH] they should have something [LAUGH] done to them.  I -- I agree with you there, too.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, like money taken away, public shame.  [SIGH]
L:  Right.
R:  You know, another -- another big deal that they had going on are all these [SIGH] offshore tax shelters.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, that's true.  Uh-hum.
R:  We're supposed to pay our taxes [SIGH] but they, because of loopholes in the rules, [SIGH] have all their money offshore and don't have to pay their taxes.  [SIGH]
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  And so it's like [SIGH] you -- you know I -- I remember hearing, um, [SIGH] -- um, a -- an article -- reading an article by [SIGH] Bill Moyers and he's, like, [SIGH] you know, regarding the class war and it's like rich people [SIGH] you've won!
L:  Right.
R:  You've won the class war.  You're on top.
L:  Mm.
R:  [SIGH]  Now wh- when is enough?  When can you just be ... happy with what you have or do you have to [SIGH] keep --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] squeezing more and more and more [SIGH] money out of all the -- all the poor people which really seems like it's a big competition.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, it seems [NOISE] like that.  Yes.  [NOISE]
R:  And, um, [MN] so where does this -- where does this end?  What are we [SIGH] -- what are we supposed to do at the end of it?  [SIGH] [NOISE]
L:  I have no idea.  I do not have the solution.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Well, you're in idyllic Grants Pass and so you're [SIGH] -- you get to kind of, ah, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, [MN] be, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, kind of isolated from it in a way.  But, really, no one's isolated, are they?  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  No, because [SIGH] we, ah, [SIGH] have, um, [SIGH] the TV and, ah, [NOISE] news all the time if we want it.  [SIGH]  And, um, by [NOISE] [SIGH] listening to [SIGH] [NOISE] CNN and Fox News and, ah, [SIGH] ESPN or Crescent[?] sports but, [NOISE] [SIGH] ah, we've already talked about sports in another [NOISE] subject, I guess.  [NOISE]  So, ah ...
R:  Okay.  [SIGH]  Well, I have a, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a book to recommend, ah, on this --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on this subject, [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- ah, written by a very talented, ah, [SIGH] -- ah, person named Ariana Huffington.  [MN]
L:  Oh, yes.  I [SIGH] --
R:  And it's --
L:  -- I --
R:  -- have you heard of her?
L:  Yes, I have I've seen her on, ah, [SIGH] -- ah, TV.  Uh-hum.
R:  She's witty and intelligent and [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and it -- it's these days it's very much a truth speaker it seems to me.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, yes.  [NOISE]
R:  [MN]  And, ah, she wrote a [SIGH] -- a book that, I think it was recently, even on the best seller list called --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] Pigs at the Trough.
L:  [SIGH]  Um, I heard her on, [SIGH] um, a TV show, a talk show, and she was talking about her book.  [SIGH]  And --
R:  [NOISE]  And --
L:  -- it, ah, [SIGH] it appeared to be very interesting.  Mm.
R:  Yeah, what, ah, -- what I loved about it so much [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- was not only did she chronicle in detail [SIGH] some of these larger cases of [SIGH] -- of kind of immoral theft that -- that we're agreeing there are more people besides Martha Stewart that are in this game.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  But [SIGH] at the -- at the end of the book she has [SIGH] suggestions of how to reform our system --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] that are well thought out.  And, also, [SIGH] -- ah, she also has [SIGH] organizations that you can contact [SIGH] if you want to get involved [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- with some of the reforms.  And so I -- I really l- liked it.  [SIGH]  Not only was it a thoughtful critique [SIGH] but she also was putting up some answers.
L:  Well, that sounds like a very good book.
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, it -- it definitely is.  I -- I highly [SIGH] -- highly recommend it.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Well, now were we supposed to talk [SIGH] on how this is affected us too?
R:  Oh, yes.  Why -- why don't you start on that one?
L:  Okay.  [SIGH]  Um, this has affected us I think because of the savings that we have [SIGH] -- my husband and I have started to put aside, you know?  [SIGH]
R:  Yes.  [SIGH]
L:  And, um, the interest on [SIGH] some of those have come way down.
R:  Wow!
L:  And [NOISE] so ... I think we're losing because of that.
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, I -- you know, I -- I agree.  I think that, ah, [SIGH] everyone is connected.  For myself I used to be a ... [SIGH] a businessman up until nineteen ninety five.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  I had a fourteen year career at the Houston Chronicle.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, uh-huh.
R:  And, ah, [SIGH] I was a -- a whistle blower in an ethics scandal.  Like some of my peers [SIGH] were not counting the -- the circulation numbers correctly [SIGH] so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- we could have falsely high advertising rates.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh!
R:  And I -- I relate that to a lot of this [SIGH] accounting scandals and other things.  People are trying to bend the rules [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so that they can get their bonuses and stuff.  [SIGH]
L:  Right.
R:  And, um, [MN] I -- I ended up leaving the company 'cause they started treating me like I was [SIGH] doing something wrong, just trying to [SIGH] fix some of this stuff.
L:  You were trying to stand up for the truth.
R:  Try -- trying -- you -- that's all you can do, is try.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And -- and that I thought if I -- if I kept silent on it, [SIGH] um, then I would be -- it would be the same thing as being a part of it [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- and I wasn't going to be a part of it.  [SIGH]
L:  I- it would hurt your conscience to ... keep on doing that way of it.
R:  Ab -- absolutely.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  So, that's changed my life.  I'm now an artist.  I don't, -- um, [SIGH] I don't make much money but -- but actually I have a -- [SIGH] I'm a much more wealthy person in terms of friendships and, ah, --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [SIGH] and other aspects of my life that, ah, don't involve [SIGH] money.
L:  Hm.
R:  So, in some ways being personally involved in [SIGH] one of these, like, little scandals, ah, [SIGH] has led me to [SIGH] a more true -- true way --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of being.  [MN]
L:  Uh-huh.  And you -- you're -- you're not dependent on the corporate, [SIGH] um, place in life anymore.
R:  You know, ah, not directly but it's funny because indirectly [SIGH] when times are tough, [SIGH] you know, the jobs t- that I do get I -- I'm a metal -- a metal worker [SIGH] and a --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- welder [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- and, ah, [SIGH] you know, ultimately when the whole economy slows down I -- I am affected but I -- but I have to say that I have [SIGH] a very simple lifestyle and don't have, ah, [SIGH] the monetary requirements that [SIGH] normal pe- --
