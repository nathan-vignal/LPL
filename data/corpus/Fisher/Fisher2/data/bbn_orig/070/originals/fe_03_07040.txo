R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.  This is Kaylene.
R:  Hi.  Um, I'm Susan from Virginia.
L:  I'm from, ah, California.
R:  Oh, nice.  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  All right.
L:  Is this your first call or ...?
R:  Um, this is my second one.
L:  Your second one?
R:  Mm.
L:  Okay.  This is my third so [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, okay.  So, is this --
L:  But this is the first time that they've ever called me so it threw me off a little bit. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.  So, I guess we're supposed to talk about what family --
R:  About family today.  Yeah.
L:  -- what -- what family means to me?  Well, I'll let you go first. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.  Well, um, family, I -- it's, you know, m- -- your, um -- your family are the ones you lived with and extended family are all included, you know?  Relatives and a- -- that live close and live far.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And -- and it's children and, um, grandparents and parents.
L:  Uh-huh.  Are you close to your family?
R:  Oh, yes.  Even though most of them don't live near us we still, um, talk quite a bit on the phone --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and visit.
L:  Mhm.  And do you have children of your own?
R:  Ah, yup.  I have three and --
L:  You have three?
R:  Yeah.  The -- the youngest will be graduating from high school this year.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.  Well, I'm on the opposite end of that.  Mine is, um, age one and age four so I'm a mother of young children and, um -- but, um, grew up in a -- a family of f- -- ah, four -- well, actually three other siblings -- four of us total.  And, um, family means a lot to me.  Um, grew up in a very [MN] tight knit family and, um, I actually have a twin sister so I think that that is an even greater bond.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, so it's -- i- -- definitely priority in my life.  Definitely.
R:  Right.  And -- and, oh, has yours started preschool yet?
L:  She's gonna start next year.
R:  Oh.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  She's gonna start --
R:  Well, that'll be -- that'll be a big change.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] I know. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, I can't believe that, you know, she's already that old.  But, um, [LIPSMACK] yeah.  She's gonna be starting preschool next year and it's so different to see the different personalities -- they're both girls -- and just to see how different they are and, um, it's fun.  It's fun to watch.  So --
R:  Right.  Yes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Watch as they grow.  It's n- -- yeah.  Like, my three are completely different.  It -- it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I'll have two in college -- two in college next year and the other one's -- the one's a teacher.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.  Yeah.
R:  Yep.  She lives in -- she lives in Florida still.
L:  Now, did you, ah, work when they were young and ...?
R:  Um, I didn't work until they were in school fulltime.  I -- I did some part time jobs.
L:  Part time jobs?
R:  But I -- but I didn't work fulltime w- -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- while they were --
L:  Ah -- ah, me neither.  I'm -- I'm a stay at home mom and I think that that, you know, shows our commitment to family.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's a --
R:  Once they're in school it's a lot easier and, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they have their own -- their own life at that point.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Ah --
L:  That would be the ideal is to start a little bit of part time something when they go -- go into school. [inaudible]
R:  Yeah.  Ap- -- a part of the time my husband would work.  I'd work evenings and he'd -- he'd work day time.
L:  Mm.
R:  And we even would meet sometimes in the parking lot and trade k- --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- trade kids. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's c- -- [LAUGH] oh, my goodness.  Wow.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  That's amazing.  Huh.
R:  Ha- -- it -- but -- but at least you -- you don't have to worry about a sitter then. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Hm.  Um, so do you live close to -- to your family or his family or ...?
R:  No.  M- -- um, husband's family's in -- all in Michigan and my family --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- um, most of them are in -- in Florida.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, it makes a nice vacation spot.
R:  Yeah.  One way or the n- -- the other. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Hm.
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, is your family nearby?
L:  Not mine.  No.
R:  No?
L:  Uh-uh.  Um, I came from the Portland area and my twin sister and I came down here for college, um, for something -- um, bible college.  And, so, w- -- um, she met and married a man that wanted to teach in Alaska.
R:  Oh, goodness.
L:  So, I have my younger brother and -- and my twin sister's up in Alaska.  And then my parents and my older brother are in the Portland area still.  And I'm down her in California. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Have you been to Alaska to visit?
L:  Yes.  Ah, numerous times.
R:  Oh, nice.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's fun.  I've only gone there in the summer and stuff but it's -- it's nice.  And it's nicer still that my brother's up there and I can visit him too.  Um --
R:  Right.
L:  Because before he was in eastern Oregon going to college so it was really hard to connect everybody and to see everybody with that.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just head way north now. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Ah --
L:  Everything's north. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So --
R:  Now, this year it'll be really different 'cause I -- w- we won't have any children at home this year.  They're b- -- you know, the youngest one will be going away to college.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm.
L:  Wow.  But that's -- but --
R:  H- -- at -- but at least her and her brother will be at the same school --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for one year and then --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- he'll graduate.  So --
L:  Oh.  I can't imagine that.  It seems so far off for me. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] It goes very quickly [LAUGH] unfortunately.
L:  Yes.  Yeah.
R:  Hm.
L:  Oh, I know.  Hm.  Yeah.  So, what, um -- what traditions and things did you do to, maybe, keep your family close?
R:  Um, main, like, um, keeping in touch as being --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so far apart to st- -- you know, stay in touch by phone and, you know -- vacations are mainly to visit family and, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, reunions, weddings, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- funerals.  Ah, and we always a- -- try to make it.  We're going to Michigan in two weeks and --
L:  Oh, are you?
R:  -- for a nephew's wedding.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  M- --
L:  That stuff is so important too.
R:  Right.  'Cause otherwi- otherwise you miss out so much.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  Mm.
L:  Um, it's amazing, especially when the kids are younger and they change so fast, that it seems like, you know, you haven't, um -- not much time has gone past but when you have small children and you go and you see them, like all my nieces and nephews, it's, just, like, "Oh, my gosh".  It seems like [LAUGH] it's been ages.
R:  Right.  M- --
L:  'Cause they're suddenly up to your shoulder and you're, like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- going, "Oh, my [LAUGH] god!"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So --
R:  Uh, yeah.  "How did you get older and I didn't?" [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Really. [LAUGH] Well, at this stage, I guess I don't mind that. [LAUGH] 
R:  No. [LAUGH] If you can l- -- it's a lot worse later. [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- my goodness.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Huh. [LIPSMACK] Well --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- I -- I'm j- -- trying to figure out all of those things, um, to keep my family close.  Yeah.  Because it is so hard.  Everybody's so busy.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But then to just really instill in my girls, um, the value of their relationship and with -- with both their parents and -- and the other siblings.  So, um -- because I want them to be close.  Yeah.  Ah, you know, I have -- what I have compared to is, um, my twin and I think that [SIGH] that's gonna really hard -- be hard to measure up.  But I want 'em to be close.  So, that's kinda --
R:  Yeah.  It's a -- it's a little hard, sometimes, with the age difference too 'cause --
L:  The age difference.  Yeah.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, ah, my girls are about, um, six years apart so --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Some things they'll do, you know -- do together but they're --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- just so completely different that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they -- they have different interests so, you know, they -- they'll spend time together but, you know, they're --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just so very, very different.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Mm.
L:  Huh.  Yeah.  It is.  It's hard to find that common ground.  Because even with, ah, the twin -- my twin, we were --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- definitely interested in different things.  But --
R:  Mm.
L:  Something I've gotta -- I don't know.  I wanna pick out some things to keep them close.
R:  Right.
L:  Keep them close.  Um, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] This -- this is --
R:  Yeah.  My husband seems to talk more to his family now, you know, than --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- he has, you know, over -- over, like, quite a few years.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, one of his nephews went to Ir- Iraq and the family --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- kinda, got closer together and, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- kept up on things and I think that helped a lot.
L:  Yeah.  I don't know how my husband would be.  We live close to his family and so he's never been, really, away from them.  And so, sometimes, I wonder how it would be if we lived closer to my family and, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, I'd -- I -- my parents have talked about moving, um, to California just to be near us and that would -- oh, my goodness, that would, just, be, kinda, my ultimate dream. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  Is to have b- both of them that close.  Um, but I don't think that it -- it will work out but --
R:  Yeah.  It'd be -- it'd be nice.  My parents -- w- well, my -- my dad died, um, about two years ago.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And my mom isn't well now and she's getting quite older --
L:  Well, that is hard.
R:  -- and it's hard because we can't really help out like we'd like to.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  That l- -- ah, you know, it leaves it to m- my sisters that are in Florida still to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know?  But one of them will usually go stay with her at least on the weekends and s- --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- take her to church and get her out.
L:  Yeah.  That is a concern.
R:  Yeah.
L:  My, um, mother has outlived both of her parents.  They -- both of her parents died pretty young.  And so, f- -- a lot of the times when I visit her and she's not in really, you know, great health or anything, I -- I always wonder if it's gonna be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the last --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- visit --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that she's good and healthy and strong.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  You know?  So, it just --
R:  You know, it makes it -- ah, as they get older th- -- it's hard because you [NOISE] go to visit and y- you can just [NOISE] seem, you know, going downhill and --
L:  Going downhill.
R:  Right.  And --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] And my mom was, you know -- I mentioned going to my son's graduation next year and, "Well, if I'm still around, then I'll go" you know?
L:  Y- -- oh, my goodness.
R:  [NOISE] I was, like [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, my goodness.
R:  Ah --
L:  That would be hard.
R:  R- right.  A- --
L:  That's -- that's gotta be so hard.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Especially if --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you were really close and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- stuff.  Well, it -- it sounds like you haven't had any, kind of, family --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- traumas or anything.  That's good.
R:  No.  Nothing -- no.
L:  Me neither.
R:  No major -- no -- not -- you know?
L:  We must be one of the fort- --
R:  Really, our family -- no divorces or, you know --
L:  Really?
R:  -- too much of it, you know?  No.
L:  Yeah.  That is awesome.
R:  Yeah.
L:  N- neither on my side.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Ah, for my -- my family.  I think it's just a real blessing.
R:  Right.
L:  So, um, [LIPSMACK] yeah.  That's cool.
R:  But pay enough -- I think cellphones help a lot too to keep --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- keep in touch.  I know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- my daughter in Florida calls --
L:  For the cost of -- yeah.
R:  -- every day. [LAUGH]
