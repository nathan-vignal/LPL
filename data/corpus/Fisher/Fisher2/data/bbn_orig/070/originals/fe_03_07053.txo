R:  Oh, hi Tracey, my name's Bob.
L:  Hi Bob.
R:  Well --
L:  How are --
R:  Who's going first?
L:  Um, it doesn't it, or you want to go first?
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm retired.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, and I have a very small family --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, I have no brothers and sisters --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, I only have three full cousins, and I have two children.
L:  Okay.  [inaudible]
R:  So, basically it's two children.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  Um, sounds basically what it is.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I've --
L:  I, um -- I have a small, ah, family as well.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I, ah -- I'm an only child, and, um, really --
R:  Oh, the same.
L:  -- really -- huh?
R:  Same as me.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  No --
L:  See that?
R:  -- no brothers and sisters.
L:  No brothers and sisters.  I honestly like it to be totally honest.  [LAUGH] I'm, um -- I'm twenty four years old, I'm -- my best friend is my mother, and, um, till this day we do everything together.  Everyone thinks I'm abnormal for it, but, I think it's absolutely great, 'cause it kept me out of trouble.  Um, [LIPSMACK] and I -- ah, I live my aunt and --
R:  Well, you've matured enough to recognize that.  
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I bet ya when you were eighteen you didn't recognize that.  [LAUGH]
L:  No, ah, you know wha- -- you know what I've always, always rec- -- I've always recognized that.  I never were embarrassed or anything.  I've always been, I don't know, I guess, a little abnormal.  [LAUGH] I've always been, um, -- [LIPSMACK] is like, you know, some kids like, ah, always -- oh, like, "Don't drop me off here, drop me off, you know, and pull down -- pull down off the road and then -- then I'll walk to" -- I never, um, -- was never embarrassed.  I've -- I've always, like, you know, welcomed my family, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't know, and, um, I live with my aunt and, um, my stepdad --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- my parents are divorced.  But my -- my stepdad and my father are best friends.
R:  Well, that's --
L:  [MN] Go figure.
R:  That- that's one I don't think I've heard before.
L:  No.  See, that's a new one right.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  That's -- that's the new one.
L:  [LAUGH] I'm try- -- we're going to put the Osbournes in here.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  That's -- that's --
L:  Move over Osbournes.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, so, you have no brothers or sisters either?
L:  No.
R:  And no children?
L:  Nope.  No -- no children.
R:  No children.  And, of course, my parents -- I'm retired, so my parents are deceased for --
L:  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  My aunt just passed --
R:  -- approximately, oh, I guess about ... fifteen years.  And, so --
L:  Oh, that's -- it's hard --
R:  -- so, but I still think, you know, they're -- I- I'm very disappointed when I hear all of these family rifts and, you know, where they don't talk to each other and they do each other in, and they do this and that --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- I mean, who else d- -- who else do you have in this world?
L:  I know.  It's hideous.  It doesn't matter all the money in the world, everything, when it comes down to -- my aunt just passed on, on just last night, and -- my great aunt, actually --
R:  Oh, my.
L:  -- and she's ninety three years old, so, um, god bless her.  I mean, I wish I can live to ninety three.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  But, um, you know, it's -- in the end it's like, it's all you have is your family.
R:  That's all you have.  And --
L:  You know, and it doesn't matter w- who you are and what you did, and it's that's it.  So --
R:  -- and I see so many of these people have burned out their relations and, you know --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- they really, ah, i- in fact they've taken advantage of their family so much that when they're in dire straights they can't call on their family any more.
L:  Right.  I know, and then it's li- -- it's all on them.  You know, and -- and they do -- and people do this to themselves 'cause in that -- in our situation actually, my, um, my great aunt's daughter, she has two daughters and they don't get along at all, and they're just completely opposite of my mom and my aunt, because my mom and my aunt Are -- we live together, you know, and --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- it's -- but they don't -- they -- they despise each other so, they don't help each other out at all.
R:  Right.  
L:  That's [inaudible] --
R:  Yeah, that's -- I don't know, it just -- well, as I say, not having any brothers or sisters, and you don't either, it's -- it's -- it's hard for me to think about, um, the relationships, or the lack of relationships I hear between siblings.
L:  Yes.  Me too.  Definitely --
R:  You know?
L:  -- definitely.  I too.  I always tell my mom, like "You know what, thank god you just had me, because [LAUGH] --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- there's just too much -- well, there's too much bother".  I'm like, "Too much of this one's getting that", or, [SIGH] oh, I don't know, sharing [inaudible] --
R:  Well, that is true.  My two boys, now my boys are rather young.  My boys are only eighteen and twenty --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- ah, and, um, of course neither are married.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Well, not of course, but, ah, neither are married.  [LAUGH] And --
L:  Well, no, I'm not married either.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and they -- they don't get along well.
L:  No, huh?
R:  They don't.  And -- and I just -- I just -- 'cause they -- they [SIGH] you know, I'm here in California and this is a standard California family.  They -- they grew up with their mother mostly --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but, ah, I just don't get it --
L:  No.
R:  -- and, ah, I just don't get it, and there's very little I'm gonna be able to do about it.  And some of the people that know my boys think that once they, you know, are out of the house and on their own and this and that, they'll be lucky -- they're -- they're so much against each other, they'll be lucky to send each other a birthday card.
L:  Yeah, huh.  I -- see we're --
R:  They're just gonna walk off into the sunset in different direction --
L:  And never see each other again.
R:  -- in different directions.
L:  See, that -- that's where these -- these two are, and I mean, even though my aunt lived with us, she's -- my mother and her fight constantly -- constantly, so, it's like, oh, you know, whenever I hear them, everything.  My aunt's older and, um, [LIPSMACK] my mom's the younger sister, and I -- I don't know what it is, but, they constantly are fighting, so --
R:  Oh, they are fighting?
L:  Oh, yeah, they fight constantly.  I mean, they love each other, but they bicker constantly like they did when they were little kids, I'm sure.  You know, it's -- 
R:  Is it --
L:  -- it's just my aunt's like crazy about stuffed animals still.  If my -- if I give my m- mother, say I don't know, a bear for mother's day or something, she's like, "Oh, my -- my face is -- y- your face is cuter than mine", like you know, stupid stuff.  I'm like, "Will you let it go?  You know, you're -- you're sixty something years old, stop".  You know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Don't they have -- 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- well, maybe they're fortunate enough not to have to worry about money or anything, or family.  Don't they have anything more constructive to do?
L:  Yes, exactly.  I know, they should.  No, their whole life revolves around me, 'cause I'm the only child.
R:  Uh-huh.  Oh, you're -- your aunt doesn't have children?
L:  No.  She was, um, married, but then she was divorced, and, um, [MN] she never had any kids, and, ah, that was basically it, so, she, ah -- it was all about me, and it's sort of hard for me because it's like I have two moms, you know?
R:  Yeah.  That's interesting.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That's interesting.
L:  It's definitely, ah, typical, because if my mom says something to me, she'll mimic it, like a couple of seconds later.  Even though she knows she just said the same exact thing, she'll just like reinstate it, and that aggravates me, you know.  So --
R:  Hm.  Mm.
L:  [LAUGH] It's a little hard.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Where -- where -- where are you -- what city are you in?
L:  I'm, um, near New York City, in New Jersey.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.  I live like twenty minutes from New York City.
R:  Mhm.  Um --
L:  So -- but I -- I want to move out to California.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, ah, there's already a lot of people that proceeded you, but, um, I guess you're at home because the --
L:  Oh, no jobs.
R:  No jobs.  No jobs.
L:  It's horrible.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I send my resume about -- to about thirty people a week, and I might get back two replies a month saying, "Sorry".  [LAUGH] It's horrible.
R:  Well, talking about family, do you have anyone [LAUGH] --
L:  Connected?
R:  -- that will hire you in the family, [LAUGH] that has a business or anything?
L:  Connected to family?  No.  Not -- not what I want to do.  I want to go into something with, um -- I used to intern for the NFL, [LIPSMACK] so I want to do something with like sports entertainment.  Something along those lines, maybe like a sideline reporter for, ah -- but that's like in my dreams, so --
R:  Okay.  Yeah, that's --
L:  -- who knows?
R:  -- boy, that's [SIGH] kind of tough, um --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
R:  -- with the -- you know, with the -- with the job situation that way.
L:  Definitely.  It definitely is.
R:  Definitely.
L:  So --
R:  Well, let me see, ah, as I said, my family is so small, and yours is so small --
L:  Ah, no, exactly.  We don't have anybody -- I have no one to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- reach out to --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I have to start looking at alumnis where I went to school.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Right.  
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  Well, my two --
L:  My next one --
R:  -- boys, as I say, um, you know, ah, one's graduating high school --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and the other is -- is in college --
L:  What school does he go to?
R:  Ah, he goes to a college out here called Claremont[?].
L:  Okay.  Yeah, I've heard of it.
R:  And, um, ah, but they just -- they tolerate each other, and as I say, it's gonna be kind of interesting whether my friends who are much more savvy about family than I am --
L:  Right.
R:  -- ah, it's -- ah, if it's really gonna be true that they'll be lucky to send each other a birthday card.
L:  Wow.  I hope not, [LIPSMACK] because --
R:  I don't know.  I hope not.  In -- in fact, even to this day ... I try not to be with both of them at once --
L:  Really?
R:  -- because i- something happens, ah, I don't know, the things just don't go smoothly --
L:  No.
R:  -- when they're both together.  Each one separately, um, the younger one, I'm -- I'm -- I'm extremely close to.  The older one, you know, has some kind of like psychological problems and is very reserved and --
