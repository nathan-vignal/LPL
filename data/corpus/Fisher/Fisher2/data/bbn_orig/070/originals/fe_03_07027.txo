R:  What are they?  I didn't get the last sentence you said.
L:  The kids.
R:  Oh, okay.  They mean now everything to you.
L:  Right.
R:  I see.  That's very good.
L:  And how about you and your mom, how is your relationship going?
R:  Ah, it's pretty good.  We are pretty close.  And I've been with like -- we have our differences, but it's pretty good we are pretty close to each other and I guess that's really kind of about it.
L:  Oh.  Okay.  I take it you're not from ah US, the United States?
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  Where are you from originally?  What --
R:  Ah, I'm from India.
L:  India.
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh.  Are you in India now, or ...?
R:  No, I'm in New Jersey right now.
L:  Oh.  Okay.
R:  And I live with my mother.
L:  Okay.  When did you come to New Jersey?  When did you come from India.
R:  Ah.  Ah -- since ninety eight.
L:  Oh, so you're freshly over here, then.  You haven't been here twenty years.  Is there a big cultural difference?
R:  Oh, yes.  It's very, very different.  Um, the -- the -- the difference like in -- even in family and in culture, everywhere.  It's pretty different here.  But I like it a lot.
L:  As is important.
R:  Yes.
L:  I guess, in all cult- -- cultures your family's still your most important thing in the world, you know, what that it still comes first to you?
R:  Yeah, it really does.  Um, yeah.  But I've seen people here who are very close to their families too.
L:  Oh.  A lot of it too is there's not a lot of respect with some of the younger people nowadays, but --
R:  Yes, yes.  That's what I've seen here, but I -- it's not that bad over there, but I've seen that definitely here.  [PAUSE]
L:  Right.  I notice that there's a big ah cultural change now --
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  -- from when I was growing up.
R:  Yeah.  That's I heard.  I heard that ah that's -- a lot of things have changed over the past twenty, thirty years.
L:  Right.  Yeah.  Ah, things were a lot stricter whe- -- back when, too and well, a lot of things are so open to families now, you know, and their kids, the drugs and the drinking and just about anything and um that was -- a lot of that we weren't exposed to when we were growing up.
R:  Oh, I see.  I thought it was bad -- bad then too.  Maybe it's not that -- maybe it was not that bad then.
L:  No, it wasn't.
R:  I see.  I'm not too familiar with that kind of concepts because I grew up in different culture in regards to family and stuff like that.
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  Yes.  That's very good.
L:  Now, what is a little bit different in your culture about with your family?
R:  Mm, we like well, see, like we respect our parents more and just our responsibility to take care of your family, no matter what.  Even though if you have differences or any problems with that.  And as, as you say, it's the most important thing.
L:  Right.  Right.  Now, that is a big cultural difference, then, because I know younger people nowadays, they're more into their careers and things like that rather than into their parents, like it used to be.
R:  That's true, that's true.  And like in India we used to have a joint family, which just I don't see that much often over here and I think that's a big difference.  I think people run away from that over here.
L:  Right.  And I imagine too in India it's a lot stricter than what it is here, too?
R:  Yes, um, I won't say it's stricter, there are like no laws that you are to do that, but I think it's just our culture that everybody does that.
L:  Right.  Yeah, I ah -- I -- it seems to have been a very interesting talking to you about that.  That -- I've never really thought about that before but it's really something to hear about, you know, the different cultural --
R:  Yes, that's true.  I don't see that many joint families over here and I hear- -- I hear that people don't want to live with their family once they're eighteen.
L:  Yeah, that -- that is true.
R:  They just --
L:  You know, they -- they -- they want to get out on their own and do their own things, so --
R:  That's right.  Mm and that's a big difference over here.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, but it's like I -- I have heard that the people grow up and they're like they're -- they are very responsible person and they are like on twenty five, twenty six and stuff like that.  I think they just want fa- -- ah, freedom from their family.
L:  That's what a lot of 'em are doing, are just g- -- trying to get away from their families.  You know, and so they reach that magic age of eighteen and they legally they can do it.  So, that's why they, you know, they move out because they don't like the rules set down by the parents, so --
R:  That's -- that's true.  What do you think they're like what are -- what are the benefits you have, like from your personal experience with your family?
L:  Oh, I've been through very good things and very hard things with my family and ah [LIPSMACK] it's been very hard [SIGH] --
R:  I see.
L:  -- but ah you know I've gotten through -- through it with ah my higher power and I just keep struggling along and trying to and enjoying my -- my kids and um you know the different things that they do and -- and then I take great pride in my granddaughters, too, I -- I thoroughly enjoy them.
R:  That is very good.
L:  So, that's my -- my big thing is my granddaughters.
R:  I see.  Mm --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then, yeah, it's good to have fun with your family.  
L:  Some day you'll know, -- one day you'll become a dad [LAUGH].
R:  Yes.  I know.
L:  Yeah, because there's nothing in the world like ah -- it's really hard to describe because it's a feeling that you have to go through it in order to really experience it.
R:  Mm -- yeah.  I -- you cannot expect [inaudible] you just have to go through it.  That's true.
L:  Yeah, because I know ah being a parent it's -- you know, you can tell everybody about it and things like that, but you -- you really have to be one in order to really experience it, you know, the joys and -- and the heartaches and all the things that come with it, but ah -- you're young yet, so enjoy your life before you're ready to settle down and -- and ah have your family
