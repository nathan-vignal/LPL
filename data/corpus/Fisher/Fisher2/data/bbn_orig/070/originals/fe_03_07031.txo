R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  My name is Phyllis.
L:  Hi, my name is Michael.
R:  Hi.
L:  How are you?
R:  Okay.  Pretty good.  
L:  [MN]
R:  H- how do we do this?
L:  I don't know.  This is actually my first time, um --
R:  Oh, it is for me also.
L:  -- I've been -- because I've been busy, I haven't had a chance with this in like two weeks, and I've been --
R:  O- oh.
L:  -- not able to do it, um, so, I guess we learn on the fly.
R:  Oh, I didn't know -- yeah, they didn't prepare me.  I didn't -- I didn't -- I didn't know, I thought it was a professional that [COUGH] gets you started or whatever, but --
L:  No.
R:  -- oh well, this is just two regular participants.
L:  Yeah, I -- I actually thought --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- it was a machine --
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  -- that I would be --
R:  Right.
L:  -- basically just rambling on, which is why I -- I thought that would be kind of hard to talk for ten minutes.
R:  Me too, exactly. That's what I --
L:  And then without any input or -- or questions --
R:  That's what I tried yesterday.  Anyway, I think we'd better get to the subject, family.
L:  Okay.
R:  I [MN] -- I don't like when people mention family and I feel very hurt and very sad because [MN] I'm not in touch with whatever family I do have [MN] and I'm old enough that I should have had my own family by now, but I never married and had children, so I kind of envy people that have family, even the ones that complain about their family --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I -- I think so much like, "Oh, I wish I had a sister or brother to complain about.  I wish I had parents to say 'Oh, they're dominating my life, or they're interfering'", you know, I miss having family and parents, 'cause all my holidays are like with strangers --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and not with, ah, really friends or family.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, well, um, I can kind of sympathize with -- with both sides of that, because, um, I'm an only child --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- um, and the family that I have here, um, is basically my mother and father.  All my cousins and aunts and uncles are, ah, in North Carolina, but --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I do have five children now --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- um, so I -- I -- I sort of like live my childhood through them.  Um, so, we do a lot of playing and -- and -- and such, and it's --
R:  Well, that's great.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, because I -- I always think like, "How -- how can I get my childishness out of me because it gets m- -- it gets me into trouble", because I keep judging myself, "Oh, you're childish, you're this, you're that", and I'm thinking, "But other people have fun", but then be a child when they have there own, right.  It's sort of like you said, you're living out your childhood.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, because I was like -- I'd learned to play by myself very well, um --
R:  Mhm.  
L:  -- I was just --
R:  But it gets lonely and boring when you play by yourself, right?  So -- so, you're like limited how much you can do with yourself, right?
L:  Yeah, but at the same time, um, I guess it has -- it has its advantages --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and its -- its drawbacks.  The main thing was --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- um, what it taught me to become, independent.  
R:  Right.
L:  But at the same time, um, for example, ah, my wife, she comes from a big family --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so basically when we were married, I inherited, you know, her family --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I get to know, "Well, we were used to doing things this way at Christmas.  And we were used to doing things that way at Christmas".  So --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like I said, by being an only child, but now having a large family extended --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- um, it -- it's -- it's neat to try and see, you know, both sides of the -- of the fence, or the [inaudible].
R:  When you get [COUGH] -- when you got married [MN], did your family members attend your wedding?
L:  Yes.
R:  Like your parents and stuff?
L:  Uh-huh.  There was a -- there was a nice wedding.  It was -- it was -- it was --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- pretty big, and --
R:  Well, that sounds great.  It's so -- you know, I've never been married, and I can't even see myself, ah, that far advanced into a relationship, because I seem to break out of relationships and -- and never get to the point where I really, you know, get committed, engaged and married, you know, legally --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I've been, like kind of married emotionally and mentally and spiritually, but never legally --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I can't -- like I can never see myself -- I always say, "Oh, my god, who would want to do that, because it doesn't work.  It's so hard and it's so painful".  And then when you've kids -- like I always think of all the burdens and problems and troubles before I even get that far.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And like I admire someone like you that took all these risks to have like five children and a wife and all that.  Do you -- do you like really like being a mem- -- you know, like a father and everything and a husband?
L:  Yeah, well, it's -- I mean, ah, I'm not going to lie to you, it's hard sometimes, um --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- because I have, ah, a seventeen year old and a sixteen year old --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so, when right now they're kind of -- the boy's sixteen and he's kind of rambunctious and -- so, i- it's -- I mean, at the end of the day, you know, the [MN] -- the pluses outweigh the -- the minuses by far.
R:  Mm.
L:  Um --
R:  Well, di- did you ever at any point, like say to yourself like, "Oh, no, we're going to have another child.  Oh, no, my wife's pregnant again."  I mean, 'cause to -- 
L:  Well, you know what?  --
R:  -- to me that sound like normal, like why would -- wouldn't people say, "Oh, no.  Not again, we gotta go through the same thing again with a baby", and all that.
L:  Well, we started like young --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so, um -- like I'm thirty six now --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and my youngest is ten --
R:  Uh- Uh-huh.
L:  -- so, at that time, you know, I was still young enough to, um, be able to interact with the children --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- um, I see now a lot of people, um, [LIPSMACK] waiting, ah, letting their career come first --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and so, you know, ah, having a family --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I always thought that, you know, I didn't want to be, you know, forty years old with --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, a toddler in the house.
R:  Right.  Right.  Well, I think it's good the way that you did it.  You're -- it's perfect, 'cause you didn't even think too much, worry too much.  You just did it naturally, right?
L:  Yeah, now that the fact that I can --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- relate to the children --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- because we're -- it's not like we're that close, but still at the same time.
R:  That's right.
L:  You know, it's -- it's -- it's -- it's cool.
R:  Well, that sound -- you know, it sounds really good, because I'm like, ah, fifty one, I hate to say, and never been married and never had children, and I regret so much that I didn't have them [MN] you know, in my younger years.  [MN] And I talked to sometimes like men that [MN] -- that I know -- two particular men [MN] they go, "Okay, want to have a baby?  Come on, let's go."  And I go, "Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  [MN] I didn't wait fifty one years to just go right ahead".  I must of, you know, [MN] there must be something about me that I decided not to have children that I do- -- I can't see like doing it now.  I said to myself, "No, you should a had had it when you were in your twenties." 
L:  Mhm.
R:  "You should have did it when everybody else ...".  You know, normally this way I'm a grandmother by now and I'm retired and having these little children and all that.  Like -- like, I can't picture, because like I'm very like selfish and self centered in a way, a- and I don't feel [COUGH] like I wanna even do for anybody else.  That's why probably I never got married, I always felt like, "Who wants to clean up every- once a -- do for some other adult, and much less a child", even though I see the good.  I always say that I'm gonna do all the work.  It was gonna be a burden on me, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, I'm single and carefree, and as it is I feel like I'm burdened and got too much to do.  And I said, "What would I do if I had a kid that I would have the ...", you know, then I've said, "Oh, my god, now look at what my husband did to me" --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- "He got me in this spot, [LAUGH] and now I'm ...", you know --
L:  Yeah, well, every --
R:  -- I always look at the negative, like where I'm gonna be trapped for life and I'm always gonna have the -- because, you know, you said, "So, who want -- who wouldn't want to have to do all that?"  You have to, you know -- the way I look at it -- a child, you really gotta be, you know, very devoted and, you know, rea- really so responsible and, ah, I -- I don't see the rewards outweighing the --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- the -- the [LAUGH] the burdens --
L:  Well, the --
R:  -- or the -- you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah, well, everything isn't for everybody --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- you know, tha- --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that's just because you can bare children that doesn't mean that you have to.
R:  Right.  And maybe it's, um -- there's a real reason.  [COUGH] I don't know, I just never thought I could do it.  I used to feel stressed out being single, and I'd say, "Oh, how stressed out would I be [LAUGH] with children?" you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- 'cause I never really [COUGH] I guess had a boyfriend or husband, you know, that I -- a boyfriend that I'd trust enough to marry that would provide for me, a- and being kind of selfish, I would always think, "Well, if the man ain't gonna do right for me, and I'm not satisfied with him now, if I marry him and have a child, then what?"  You know, then also, you know, taking care of me and my child, and I'd be -- so, I guess I always saw ahead, "This is not going to work", but yet I'd stay with the man and, you know, be [COUGH] -- be kinda like trying to have a family, but yet not really, you know, 'cause I realize that doesn't always work when you stay in a relationship and you don't grow and kinda, you know, go forward, you know, and kinda like married and have a family.  It's very frustrating, 'cause then you feel like you're wasting -- I feel like I wasted so many years --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, with men that they -- now I'm even like, "Who cares about [LAUGH] you know, them at all".  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Even though I kinda want the comforts, and I want, you know, the -- the benefits and all that --
L:  Mm.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  Well, the -- I mean --
R:  But I miss having -- not having a family on holidays.  That is j- -- I feel very l- -- you know, I feel like I just don't fit in, and I say, "No.  There's nothing like having people ...", you know, and yet I do have like cousins and aunts and uncle, but I feel so estranged from them --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I always feel too stigmatized.  I said, "Well, I'm the one that never had children.  I'm the one never got married".  Most of my relatives did, you know.
L:   So, you think that that's why -- do they feel a certain way towards you because of that?
R:  [COUGH] Well, it's kinda like I do it -- do a number on myself, judging myself, and worried so much about what they're gonna think of me, that -- that I'm not finding out what they really do think, [LAUGH] you know what I mean?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'm kinda like keeping myself all kinda, um, into this, you know, and -- and it bothers me because people will tell me, "Oh, your family don't want you", and I said, "That's not true".  It's just that I don't feel, um -- I don't feel right, because kinda my family's split apart.  Ah, my parents, like, weren't getting along, and then, you know, relatives die and you don't like ke- -- with it -- my family didn't keep the family, ah, connections together --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [COUGH] you know, and there was problems and all, then my father would say, "Well, I don't want to bring the family over.  Look at the way we're living".  And I said, "Well, is it my fault?  No.  You know, bring them over anyway if you miss your family".  'Cause I was still -- it's like my parents' family, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'm just the daughter.  And then I had a brother that died many years ago, and that kinda hurt, you know, so there's been losses in the family, and I never replaced, you know, the losses so that's --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- ah -- so, that's probably where my loneliness is, but I really -- I really -- like I grew up in a very small, um, like only a brother, and he was always out with friends and he wasn't that much of a close relative to begin with.  And even my parents, it's like I didn't grow up in a typical normal family, you know, so I never even grasped the concept of what it's supposed to be, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  It was like everybody went their own way, and yet, together somehow my parents held it together, but it was always ready to break apart, and so I even feel like, "Who needs family.  Look at what the family" --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- "can do to you", you know, it affects you, y- you know in a certain way.  So, I kinda grew up where I always kinda fighting dependency on other people and then I want to be too independent and then you say, "Well, you can't be too", you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Too much where you don't want to need a man, or you don't want to need and -- and yet I envy people that have --
