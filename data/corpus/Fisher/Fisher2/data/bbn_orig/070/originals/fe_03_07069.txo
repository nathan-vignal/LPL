R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  How you doing?
R:  I'm doing good.  How are you?
L:  I'm doing good, thank you.
R:  Okay.  Um --
L:  So, what does family mean to you?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.  I guess a lot of things, you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It's a big topic, I guess.
L:  It's big.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I come from a big family, so, I guess --
L:  You come from a big family?
R:  Yeah.  The eight of us, so --
L:  Wow, that's a lot.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Um --
R:  Do you have a lot in your family?
L:  Um, there's only three of us in my family.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I consider that -- it's been a okay size.
R:  Yeah.  That's pretty normal, right?
L:  Yeah.  I have an aunt who had fourteen [SIGH].
R:  Fourteen, huh?
L:  Fourteen kids.  [LAUGH]
R:  They got fourteen kids? Mm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's a lot.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.
L:  That's way too many.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I know some people down in New York and they got thirteen -- thirteen kids, something like that.  A lot of twins though.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I had a friend once, who's her mom only had twins and triplets --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and they were totaled twenty something.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, like when there's a lot of kids, um, like that --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- there's a lot of twins and triplets.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, not a lot of triplets, but, ah, lots of twins.  They got like three sets of twins --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- like six of those.  Yeah.  It's a lot them.  They got like, um, three, no four washing machines, four dryers --
L:  [MN] Wow.
R:  -- they got -- yeah.
L:   The stress.
R:  [inaudible] that's a big family, you know, I mean, they put -- that's a lot of work, yeah.  And then --
L:  Yeah.  Well, I'm just thinking how do you -- 'cause I think part of being a fam- -- paying attention to the kids and --
R:  Yeah.  Well, they get a lot of attention.  [LAUGH]
L:  But individually, or as --
R:  I mean, I don't know if it's in -- from the parents, or what, but -- [LIPSMACK] I know a lot of people from big families, they like their privacy that's for sure [SIGH], so --
L:  Their what?
R:  They like the privacy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  See, they always have, you know, a lot of things -- a lot of hand me downs and stuff like that.
L:  Well, I would imagine financially it would be a burden --
R:  Mm.  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, unless you come from a well off family.
R:  Yeah.  That's true.  Well like a lot of these -- they have a lot of hand me downs, a lot of, um, the kids they always got jobs young, you know, so they always learn how to work.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  Like in my family we always learned to work young, so you learn the responsibilities and stuff, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's good in that way, you know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  You learn how -- you learn, I guess, to share a lot and you -- you have friends within your family, I guess.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or company growing up, 'cause I know with -- with me there's a huge age gap.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, so it's --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I really can't relate [LAUGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- too much with -- with my siblings.
R:  I see.  Are you the first one, or --
L:  Yeah, I'm the first one.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, and then there's a seven year difference between me and my sister and then a fourteen year difference between me and my brother.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, yeah, kind of hard.
R:  Yeah, it's --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it's -- it's interesting, ah, for the parents then, you know.  Um, I know my parents, they didn't always have a lot of time.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, 'cause --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, like, with, ah, soccer practices and this and all of these different things you had to do, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they couldn't do without my grandpar- -- without my, ah, grandparents, I know that.
L:  Yeah, my grandmother basically raised me, two working parents.
R:  Oh, yes, that's the way it is now, yeah, mhm.
L:  Mhm, so we're ver- -- I'm -- I'm very close with my grandmother.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, that's a good thing.
R:  Yeah.  A lot of people don't have that, you know?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  A lot of people don't live near their grandparents, so --
L:  That's true.  Well, we lived next to my grandmother for almost twenty years.
R:  Mhm.
L:  She was devastated when we moved away.
R:  Oh my god.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, we're no- -- we're not that far, we're about ten minutes away from her now.
R:  Oh.
L:  But for her --
R:  Oh, so she moved then?
L:  We moved.
R:  Oh, okay, mhm.
L:  But, um, for her it's still a -- a long distance.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, we're only ten minutes away.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, I know some friends of my family, they, um, they retired and they said they were going to move to Nevada or something like that and then their kids moved --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to southern California so they moved over there [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and then the kids moved to Florida, so they moved over there.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  When they was retired, you know, so I guess they want to be near the grandchildren, you know, so.
L:  Mm.  I guess it gets lonely.
R:  That's normal, ah, you know, they want to be near their grandchildren, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if they're lucky, I guess, you know, [several inaudible words].
L:  They -- if they -- I mean, they could do that, yeah, go for it.
R:  Yeah, they should.
L:  Because other -- some people are not close to their family.
R:  No, you see them on the talk shows, you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But I don't think people talk about that openly in public though, you know --
L:  I don't -- yeah, I think --
R:  -- what goes on.  [MN] 
L:  Yeah, I think a lot of family shush shush.
R:  Mm, yeah, yeah, 'cause it's a private thing, so that's the way it should be, hm.  Good reasons for that, too. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's not, um -- it's hard to talk about the family necessarily, especially --
L:  It's kind of like a love hate relationship.  [LAUGH]
R:  For some people, yeah, yeah.
L:  Because sometimes, you know, I feel like --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, you love your family 'cause they try to do the best for you, but at the same, sometimes they drive you nuts.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  I don't know, but then I think about it and like there's years when I was young, they went by really quick, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, I can't even -- for me, I don't know, like -- it's like you kind of like look back and say, "God, what happened?"  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It happened so quick.  Um, everybody moved different directions and it's kind of different, but it's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's like different like that.
L:  I think you also have to do, like, culturally 'cause I know, well, my --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- background is Latino --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and family is so important, so you really -- you -- you try and not move far away from each other.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  You know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Keep that connection --
R:  Right --
L:  -- and --
R:  -- that's okay, you know, but it has to be healthy though.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  You know, like, um, [MN] I got my hair cut by my friend, he Puerto Rican, and I went to his --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- house today and they all living in the house still.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  He's thirty seven, he's a twin --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, and he ha- -- both twins live in the house.
L:  Yeah, you don't have to move until you get married.
R:  Ah, they don't push you out, right? [LAUGH]
L:  Yep.  [LAUGH]  Which is good and bad at the same time.
R:  Yeah, so, you living --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there, oh, there's a lot of people in the house, the parents live there in the house and it's like -- it's a big house, you know, so they just --
L:  Yeah, 'cause normally, ah, what I've seen is like three generations in one house.
R:  Right.
L:  And it -- it seems to work.
R:  Yeah, you know, I mean, I think with the Puerto Rican families it's more matriarchal though.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  You know what I'm saying, so, mm.
L:  Yeah.  The mom is [LAUGH] in charge.
R:  Or the grandmother.
L:  Or the grandmother, yeah, depends on --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know.
R:  Yeah.  My friend lived down in Puerto Rico for years, you know, for --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- twenty years --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um, the matriarch of the family said that he had to come up here and get a job --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and make some money to support the family down there.
L:  Wow.  [LAUGH]
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah, that's normally --
R:  So that's family, Latin families is like that, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it depends, you know, 'cause everybody's different.
L:  Yeah, because I have my friend who -- who -- who's white and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, by eighteen she was out, she was ready.  [LAUGH]
R:  She was ready to go?
L:  She was ready to go and --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- which is cool in -- in -- in a way, I kind of --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- envy her 'cause she's -- she -- she's get out, she gets out --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and the parents are supportive, where in my family --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- it's more like, "No, stay.  Why do you need to leave?"
R:  Well, it's very hard right now because, I mean, in my family, ah, like my sister, you know, she's getting ready to send one of her daughters off to college and the other one's, ah, you know, going to go and I said, "You know, you really need to stop and think about one thing if you want to keep the family nearby", you might have to because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it costs so much money to live in the New York --
L:  Oh, y- --
R:  -- area.
L:  Oh, you're in New York?
R:  Well, no, I'm in, um, New England, but she's --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- down in Jersey, this sister.
L:  Oh, okay, yeah.
R:  And I was saying, you know, "You really need to consider investing your money, you should buy a condo for when --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- your daughter gets out, she has a place to live".
L:  Yeah, good --
R:  You know, nobody ever talks about how expensive it is [LAUGH] --
L:  No they don't, I mean, comp- --
R:  -- the rent and housing.
L:  -- I'm in California and the rents are ridiculous --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I go to school in Irvine.
R:  Where's that?
L:  In Irvine.
R:  Are you in California?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So, you know, it's expensive, but I'm -- I'm very happy here, if I could stay here as long as I can and save money that way.
R:  I know.
L:  You know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'll do it, but, you know, with my friend, she's, like, oh, it's okay, you know?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  I could just be [inaudible].  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I think I prefer family now, we getting back on that topic [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I think a lot of it is financial though.  I mean, it kind of has to be, you know, like, that's the way it is, you know, so.
L:  I mean, y- yeah, 'cause you help each other.
R:  Yeah.  Like I help my parents too, like, um, my car broke down, it died, like a couple of weeks ago --
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  -- unfortunately and, um, you know, I borrowed the money from them for my mortgage and I paid them back with interest --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so I borrowed the money from them for the car and I paid --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- them back with interest on that.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's better for them because, you know, that way, in their retirement, they don't have to, um, rely on these little tiny interest rates that the banks are giving, [SIGH] um --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- so, in that way you can take care of the family too, you know?
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, because, I mean --
R:  But it's hard.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I -- I pay -- I gave my -- I give my mum some money, but, you know --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it's not the same as to having like my own apartment.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, although my car pays the price --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- ah, on the travel time but it does help --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- out the family at the same time.
R:  I think cars are too expensive, frankly, for what you get.  I mean, you get metal and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- not much.
L:  But you need it.  [LAUGH]
R:  It's a necessary evil.
L:  Yeah.  I went -- I went a long time without having a car and it saved me --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a lot of money, but now school's an hour away.
R:  Oh my god, you drive that far?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh my godfather, god bless you.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's far.
L:  Yeah --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, I only go twice a week, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's the good thing, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- got gas and -- and insurance and oil.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It adds up, so, staying at home, it -- it saves me a lot of money.
R:  Yeah.  Well, yeah, a lot of people do that.  I think one of my nieces is probably going to do that too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, maybe they're going to go [SIGH], like they're real smart, you know, but they're probably going to go to community college for two years and then transfer out because --
L:  That's a good thing, save a lot of money that way too.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, yeah, makes sense, you know, unless you have the money --
