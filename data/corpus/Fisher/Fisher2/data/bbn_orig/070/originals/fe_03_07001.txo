L:  Um -- 
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  Um, my name is Jan Hyatt.
R:  Hi, I'm Carmen.
L:  Hi.  Where do you live?
R:  Hi.  Ah, well, I'm in school in Pennsylvania now and I'm actually from Alabama.
L:  Oh really?  Ah, where are you going to school?
R:  Um, Forcemo[?] College.
L:  [NOISE] Where's that?  [NOISE] -- 
R:  Ah, excuse me?
L:  Sorry, where -- 
R:  It's outside --
L:  -- where -- 
R:  -- of Philly -- it's a small school outside of Philadelphia.
L:  In Alabama.
R:  In -- no.  In Pennsylvania.  I'm in school in Pennsylvania. 
L:  Oh.  Pennsylvania.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  I'm in Canada.
R:  Oh, hello.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I'm in Alberta, Canada.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, I don't know [LAUGH] where everything is down there.
R:  Ah, that's fine.  Ah, no.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  So -- 
L:  So, we're going to talk -- 
R:  Ah -- 
L:  -- about education.
R:  Right.  I didn't hear the question.  I was, ah -- my phone got staticy for a moment.
L:  Okay.  Well -- 
R:  Ah -- 
L:  Um, we're supposed to be talking about education and computers in education, what we think about it.
R:  [COUGH] --
L:  If it hin- -- 
R:  -- what was your --  
L:  -- helps or hinders.
R:  [MN] What's your thought?
L:  Well, I definitely think it helps in a lot of ways.  I definitely think that it helps.  It's a lot quicker for -- oh, the internet especially for research and communication and everything but I think that for writing, um, [NOISE] like stories, journals, plays, creative writing -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I believe that, [SIGH] I think that the hand and paper -- pen and paper is -- is much better for that.
R:  Hm.
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  I'm [several inaudible words] with that but I do know that like, ah, in terms of, like, doing readings -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it's really -- I find that, like, I actually -- I, ah, have a better --
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- grasp of material like when I print the readings out that are from on line or when I read the hard copy of it rather than reading on line [MN] --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- 'cause a lot of times -- yeah, and so it really does hinder me in that way.  But, at the same time, like, there's just so much more information available to me.  Like -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- instead of having to, like, tramp over to the library, you know, late at night --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or, you know -- 
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- [several inaudible words] into the library before it closes or whatever [MN] like I can just get it from the internet and I'm much more likely to do the reading.  So, it has its ups and downs. 
L:  Oh, yes.  I know exactly what you mean.  I'm not in school right now but, oh, to have to go through all the books in the library to find what you want [NOISE] and to have to take it out and then keep track of it so you can bring it back, if you take it home.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I absolutely love [SIGH] -- I love the computer.  I really do.  But -- 
R:  Yeah, it really -- 
L:  -- I agree, reading's really hard to do on it.
R:  I think that one of the nice things about computers is that they, um -- there's -- they introduce more ways of learning materials through, like, even more than one set.  Like, obviously th- they're not yet -- and I'm not sure if they ever will be yet, ah, if their -- if their technology were in, we can use, ah, like, [SIGH] incorporate, you know like the sense of smell and the sense -- sense of touch, and sense of taste, but be able to see things and hear things and everything at the same time rather than like looking at a book with a one -- with, like, you know, a still picture. 
L:  Oh.  Yes.
R:  Like, it really does -- like, ah, instead of just reading a Martin Luther speech, now you can find a recording or instead of -- [inaudible] like looking of a photo of a bird trying to memorize, you know, it's mating habits or something for a biology class, there's so much more.  Like -- 
L:  You can watch it fly.  You can hear -- 
R:  -- the information is -- 
L:  -- its call.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, it's -- it's -- the -- [SIGH] how you learn information is being changed.  Like, there are more relationships that you can put in your brain because of the computer [inaudible] like it's --
L:  Th- that's right.
R:  -- storage capacity.
L:  Oh, yes and you can [several inaudible words] -- you can have -- I don't -- well, I don't know how many books on a single CD and the storage capacity that was is just -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  -- unbelievable.
R:  Ah, I like it in that means.  But, I do think that the computer does kind of hinder in terms of it's too much of an enticement for people to, um -- 
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- it's like plagiarism for example.  Ah -- 
L:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- I was speaking to one of my friends who is -- is a professor at, ah, the high school I graduated from and --
L:  Mhm.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- she said the problem is, is that now that the internet is so very readily available to students --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- should -- you know, it's too tempting for people to plagiarize and then there's so --
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- many students and so many papers that it's almost impossible to, you know -- like, this -- to check every single paper to see if it's plagiarized. 
L:  Oh, [SIGH] yeah.
R:  And so like, what it does is it provides so much of a temptation and so much more access to, you know, people getting away with --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- turning in writing that isn't their own or ideas that aren't their own.  But, you know, the whole thing is there're certainly more ideas that you can access through --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- computers than before.  I mean, it has its upside and it's downside.
L:  That it definitely does.  Ah, I don't know.  [MN] I like -- I think that you have -- you hit the nail on the head both ways.  [NOISE]  [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  Have -- have you used computers very much in an educational context?
L:  Ah, well, I do research for myself.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I look up [several inaudible words] I'm not in, ah -- I'm not in school right now but I do it for [NOISE] when I have an interest in something I go and I search the internet for -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- for all the information I can get on that subject.
R:  Right.
L:  And I've never really had to -- I've never been in school and had to use it and have come up against those sorts of things.  The plagiarisms and everything.
R:  No, I think that computers --
L:  It -- 
R:  -- are really good for, like, younger kids because -- because computers are something that, like, older people use and you know, younger kids are like just always interested in -- 
L: [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- like, using something that adults use 'cause it's like a big --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- people's thing.
L:  Yes.
R:  Like it really engages in so much more learning.  Like, I have a young -- I have a brother who's very much younger than I.  He's --
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- just entering first grade --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- and when he sees something on a computer --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he, like, he -- he remembers it.  Like, he'll talk about it for months and months and months or, like, when I showed him, like, comp- -- at home and on my screen saver I have, you know, different artists' things coming up.  Different artists -- prints of different artists' work come up --
L:  Oh, yes.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- and, ah, you know, like, very different art, like Georgia[?] O'keefe[?], ah, Van Gogh, Asher[?], ah -- 
L:  Mm.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- and then some ph- ph- ph- -- ah, some photography by Al[?] Hind[?] and, like, they're all very instinctive.  You know, all of them have -- you can look at a painting and you just know it's Van Gogh and you look at something and you just know it's O'keefe.  You look --
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  -- at Asher and it's like so very identifiable and so I was t- -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I was showing him and I was like, "Okay".  He was just going through these [inaudible] -- just five or six artists I have on my computer and he was ta- tackling through them and after a while he started to, like, really, like, figure it out.  Like, oh, like, he said, "That ones an Asher".  You know, and this kid's, you know, six or so [MN] and -- 
L:  [NOISE] Oh, wow.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- because, like -- it was like stimulating him, he gets on the computer, like, [MN] he's, like, "You remember that -- that picture that was -- that was on your computer?  You -- you remember that?"  I said, "Yeah".  He's like, "I -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I -- I saw a picture just like that.  That Van Gogh".  You know --" 
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- he's really excited about it and he, like, associates that learning with -- with computers and he's very excited to use computers because he, like -- he's proud of the fact that he could recognize that and he could tell somebody that and it's a feather in his cap and he associates that with the computer and the computer helped him to do this thing that he's so proud of.
L:  Oh -- 
R:  So, now he wants to use --
L:  -- ah -- 
R:  -- it more so he can learn more and it's -- 
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Well, as long as it's used for educational purposes, it's great that way and -- but, then there's the games and stuff like that that are fun but that are so time consuming and that waste so much that don't teach anything. 
R:  Right.  I mean, that's what he said too.  But, I think like, even --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- games that don't -- that s- -- like, there's some games that, like, basically they're nothing more than just like action games.  But, then a --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- lot of games they really do, like --
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- Enhance [several inaudible words].  I mean, like, you think it's just like -- you know, it's like basically a fantasy novel turned into a computer game. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, like, they really do enhance reasoning power.  Like [MN] -- 
L:  And problem solving and -- 
R:  Yeah, I mean, that's -- 
L:  That kind of thing, yes.
R:  And people that even just play, like, card games on the computer like, you know, for hours on end, like, all of a sudden their ability to identify, um, patterns --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and to, like, be able to look at --
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- situations and figure out what they should do in the future, like, it is enhanced.  And I think their computer -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- while it -- like, these aren't, like, things that you couldn't get elsewhere.  It just makes these [several inaudible words] much --
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- more accessible.
L:  That's right because there's not very many -- well, there's no other format that you can get everything in.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] Yep, but -- but, at our school -- at the high school just across the street from me they have brought palm pilots -- ah, palm -- oh, what do they call it?  Personal PCs?
R:  Yeah.
L:  They're -- they're palm -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- hand held computers.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They've just inter- -- integrated that into the system and, ah, they have -- they have everything on there and they can do all their homework on it -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN] I haven't heard their -- it's a tester out here.  They're using this as one of the -- the guinea pigs -- the schools one of the g- guinea pigs to see if they want to implement that in the school system.
