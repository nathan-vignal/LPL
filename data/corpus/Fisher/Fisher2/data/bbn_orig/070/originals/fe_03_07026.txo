L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, my name is Rochelle.
L:  Hi, Rochelle.  I'm Victor.
R:  Ah, hi, Victor.  Um, what does family mean to you?
L:  Um, I was just thinking about how vague that question really was, it's kind of hard to ah [SIGH] to -- I'm not -- I'm not really sure.  Could -- d- -- would you mind talking first so maybe I can get some ideas off of you?
R:  Okay.  Well, what family means to me is depending on family, it can be a strong supportive mechanism for an individual to where it creates ah an environment for growth and nurturing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and development in the early childhood stages anyway and in the preteen and then the teen and then in adolescence um and through the family unit you basically get your personalities and you basically develop in the realm of y- -- your growth procedures as far as --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with your family there's going to be some characteristics of what your family environment is about.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Now, it doesn't necessarily mean that you have to take on all the traits, but there's going to be some um reflection of what your family is, so it is an important role in your life because what your family is made up of is going to actually reflect on you and then when you start developing in your education --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um the family reflection will still be there, or the cultural link will still be there if you're of another culture but the e- -- with the education it's going to accent and basically enhance that characteristic that has already been imbredded[?] in you through your family.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So it's like it is the root of everything good that's in you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and with education with the developing process then you go on to define who you are, but there is going to always be that root or the initial um imbreeding[?] there because you can't disassociate from your family, regardless of if you stay away from them or whatever.
L:  Yeah.
R:  There's still going to be a part of you that is linked to your family.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, um, family is important and typically to me what the family means is that I have a connection with other people that have been a vital role in my life --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they have basically imbredded[?] things in me to -- where through my education and through me going out and growing even more through ah the school systems, through college, it has basically enhanced what they initially tried to do.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then with that, taking on my -- my own personality I try to achieve all that I can be and I wouldn't h- -- have that mentality if it wasn't for something to fall back on.
L:  Definitely.  Yeah.  I -- I agree with you in the fact that they ah -- they definitely give you the building blocks for you know your future and the rest of your life, they give you those values and, you know, work ethic and yeah um, respect for other people.  I- -- they teach you, hey your parents in particular teach you um so much um that you'll -- you'll use later on in life and I guess if they don't teach you those things then that's why a lot of people don't have them.
R:  However, remember what family is.  Family now most people associate family with parents -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I associate family with the community --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because when I was in a smaller community the community imbredded in me because the teachers kinda wrapped them -- well, basically I linked myself to a lot of teachers --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and my mother and father was there and they gave me some of their reflected --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- behaviors, but remembers you don't have to stay where you are --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and what I did is with the growth with the things that I saw and the teachers that to the -- went the extra mile with me or that basically saw something in me --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I took on traits of them too because a family is a unit that is there through your growing process.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And we have to remember, teachers are there --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they're going to play a vital role, so education and family can be separated to a certain extent, but family can be a community --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of people working together for the common good --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which is for that individual's growth and development.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And what the individual does is from that initial link or building block, as you put it, which is a good um analogy --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you take all the good building blocks and you build with those --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they ones they may not be so good after the individual starts creating their own sense of worth and perspective --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then they decide whether they want to keep the negative and that's the individual's choice.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But you don't have to keep your family's traits, but you create your own, but it will always go back to what was there in the beginning.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that was your family.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, regardless of if there's something bad in a family --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- no -- and the way I perceive it is you don't have to do what your family did, you just take the strong traits that they have, like my family has determination --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they have a never quit spirit, um, I remember this in my early age.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I take the good things, the vital things that will keep me when I'm older --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that's a good root foundation --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for anything you go into because there may be disappointments along the way.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And with that even in my older life, through my family, imbredding it in me --
L:  You can stay strong through those things.
R:  I stay strong and I smile just like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the whole world is smiling with me --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- even though things may not be going right for me.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But that came via the family.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It came through -- and then other things came through not only the family, but the family being linked up with my education and them playing a vital role in it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to basically help my family to get educated.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, to me family means it's very important, but the support that they have in understanding things and knowing that change can happen for the good --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you don't have to be like your mother was, you don't have to be like your father was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  But with growth and development through it all, take all the good things --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and build on those and w- -- if you do get some of the negative things in your older age --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- don't stay there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But reflect on who you are as a person and I'm really opinionated in this sense anyway.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And know that you as a person can create a family based on what you've grown to know to be the good things --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and you can imbred[?] it in someone or in your ah lineage or in your children.
L:  Yeah, I like how -- I like how you referred to family as not just being, you know, the immediate family, but a community also because um lots of times, you know, nobody is perfect and nobody has the right answers all the time --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- and there's so much that you know two heads are better than one and there's so much more than you can learn by, you know, allowing other people to um you know give you some of those, or listening to other people's values and things like that and not just your, you know, your immediate family or fam- --
R:  And basically I've never -- when I was younger I was a listener and I would --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- listen to my family, I would listen to the teachers and most of the time I didn't take recesses, I was just found somewhere to where I could listen to what was going on around me.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that didn't stop until probably my mid twenties.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I listened to what people were saying and with that I listened to my environment that was around me --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I picked up on a lot of things, some were bad, some were good --
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  -- but now since I know --
L:  You were able to --
R:  -- since I'm older, I take out -- I'm not going to let negative things basically be reflective in anything that I do --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so I'm taking out the negative things that I've learned and I'm only dwelling on the positives because even if I stay s-
