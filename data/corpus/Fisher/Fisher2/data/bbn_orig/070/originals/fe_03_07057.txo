L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  I'm Cory.
R:  Hi Cory.  I'm Sonya.
L:  Hi Sonya. [LAUGH]
R:  Hi.  How are you?
L:  I'm good.  How are you doing?
R:  Oh, very well thanks.
L:  Good.  So, I guess we're supposed to talk about family?
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Okay.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, well [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'll start. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  Go ahead.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I'm married.  I have two little kids.
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, my son is three and a half and my daughter is almost five months and --
R:  Oh.  W- --
L:  -- right now, they're who I think of first when I think of family.
R:  Okay.
L:  How about you?
R:  Ah, for me, I'm single.  I'm in my mid thirties and, I guess --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, I'm beginning to get close to my actual blood family but when I was in my twenties --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, ah, l- -- I lived overseas and so I guess the people who were --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- my friends were closer and so I felt, like, m- -- I made a new family of my friends -- the people in the nearest proximity to me.  But now that I've moved back to the States and I live closer to my family -- I had a recent health crisis and different things that have brought me back and to -- you know, get a closer relationship with my family.  So, I guess my brothers and sisters.
L:  Yeah.  Do you have a big family?
R:  Yeah.  I'm the youngest of seven.
L:  Wow. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] That's cool.  I just have [NOISE] one sister.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  We, um -- we weren't [NOISE] very close growing up but [NOISE] the last year or two, we've actually gotten close.  M- --
R:  Okay.
L:  Believe it or not, we live, ah -- we don't live far from each other but we've gotten close just because she finally got email and so we write back and forth from work a lot. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.  That's nice.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What kind of work do you do?
L:  Um, I'm a researcher at an ad agency.
R:  Okay.
L:  [LIPSMACK] So, it's mostly, [NOISE] um, like, the in house, kinda, research for the people who make the ads --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- you know, demographics and things like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Not very exciting. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  No?
L:  Ah, must h- -- so, was it [SIGH] -- g- -- did you like growing up in a big family?
R:  Well, because they were all, um, close together in age and then I was a much m- -- I came much later so it was -- it was if I was an only child really.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, they all have -- some of them have grandchildren already --
L:  [NOISE] Oh, my goodness.
R:  -- and I don't even have kids.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, it's quite a big age difference.  The -- the next one -- I'm thirty six, the next one is fifty one -- I think she's fifty one.
L:  Wow.
R:  She's the youngest --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and so they all go --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- up.  You know, they're in their fifties --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to s- -- early sixties.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  So, we have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- quite an age gap but we're, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's, kind of, evening --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- out now that, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm a little bit older --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we have -- we have a lot in common.  My sister -- the one who is a g- -- the youngest next to me, the one I just spoke of -- she's a writer and I'm a writer so --
L:  Oh.  What kind of things do you write?
R:  Ah, well, I'm just getting back to fiction.  I had been a journalist, ah, in my early career and I'm getting back to fiction, as I was saying.
L:  [NOISE] That's -- that's, like, [LAUGH] my dream. [LAUGH]
R:  Really?  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  I actually studied journalism at college and then I just -- I didn't really get involved in it after I graduated.  I, kind of --
R:  M- --
L:  -- fell into a job at one place and then I was there for a while and then I [NOISE] got this research job.  So, writing has, kind of, been on the back burner and it's --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- something that I -- I really [NOISE] wanna do at some point. [NOISE]
R:  Okay.
L:  But it's hard to find the time now just to, [NOISE] you know -- [NOISE] to do anything.  You know?
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  I -- I keep a journal and that's about it right now.
R:  Okay.  Well, that's a good start though.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Have you published anything?
R:  Um, not since my journalism days.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I used to work for the Chicago Tribune and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- before that, the Grand Rapids Press.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And when I was in college, I worked for -- a had internships at the New York Times and the Free Press, here in Detroit -- that's where I'm from.
L:  Okay.
R:  And --
L:  [NOISE] Well, I'm in New York so --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Yep.
L:  Oh. [SIGH]
R:  New York City?
L:  Yep.  Well --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- Queens. [NOISE] So, yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.
L:  New York City.
R:  Mhm.  In the city?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I have a good friend in -- I think she -- yeah, she's in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, the Bronx and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- then one girl- -- one a- -- another good friend in Manhattan.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  So -- okay.
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] But [NOISE] --
R:  I hear your kids in the background --
L:  My sister is ac- -- my --
R:  -- I guess?
L:  Hm? [NOISE]
R:  I hear your kids in the background.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Well, ah, you know, my husband stays home with them actually and --
R:  Oh, how nice.
L:  -- I work and so when I come home [NOISE] it's chaos. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] But e- -- I thought he was, you know -- he's learning now to [NOISE] -- he's not learning to read but [NOISE] -- no, it's not Aunt Ellen. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  He's not learning to read but he's learning the letters and he's very interested in what [NOISE] starts with what letter. [NOISE] So --
R:  Oh.  Okay.
L:  -- every two minutes it's, [NOISE] "What starts with J?"  What s- --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] It's -- it's, kinda, cool though. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So --
L:  M- --
R:  -- how do you find motherhood?
L:  I like it.
R:  Mm.
L:  Um, [COUGH] -- um, I don't know.  I'm not very traditional, I guess, because we, ah, [NOISE] -- you know, my -- like I said, my husband's home with them so it's a little [NOISE] different --
R:  Right.
L:  -- than a lot of my friends and [NOISE] we also -- you know, we seem to do everything, like, [NOISE] backwards, you know?  They [NOISE] -- the kids have been sleeping with us and we get a lot of criticism for that but it's -- it works out pretty well right now and --
R:  Okay.
L:  We're just, sort of, very laid back about the whole thing. [NOISE]
R:  Mm.
L:  You know? [NOISE] Oops.  My husband's destroying the house. [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, you hear, this is [NOISE] -- this is family life here. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  Um [NOISE] --
R:  You're hearing here it's --
L:  But, you know it's --
R:  -- quiet. [LAUGH]
L:  It's fun.  I like it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I, um -- y- you know, I -- I don't know.  I -- [NOISE] -- ah, when, ah -- when we first got married I got pregnant right away [NOISE] and --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- um, I lost that baby [NOISE] and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- it was really tough on me.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, like, I didn't plan to be pregnant a month after we got married but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it happened and [NOISE] I was excited and then I lost that baby and it was [NOISE] devastating.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then I didn't --
R:  Ah --
L:  -- have my son 'til about two years after that [NOISE] so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I feel like, [NOISE] you know, since -- right since I got married, I've been dealing [NOISE] with babies and all that stuff.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, it's, kind of, weird. [NOISE]
R:  Hm.
L:  And, um [NOISE] -- you know, now I have two of them, I don't know if I'm gonna have more.  Like, I think [NOISE] if I do, it's gonna be a while from now. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  [NOISE] You know?  Ah, 'cause also, we're in a small apartment and, ah --
R:  Wow.
L:  [NOISE] So -- so, having another kid would mean, like, moving and -- and a -- a lot of other stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, right now, I'm just, ah, [MN] -- my little one's too young for me to even thing about having another [LAUGH] one.
R:  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  Um ...
R:  Okay.  So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- did your husband work before the kids were born?
L:  Well, he was a teacher, um --
R:  Oh.  Ok- --
L:  -- for a while but he has a [NOISE] stomach condition. [NOISE] He has Crohn's disease.
R:  Oh.
L:  And for a while, right around when we got married, he was very sick and so he wasn't working.
R:  Mhm.
L:  He was, ah, substitute teaching here and there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And -- but he was having a really bad couple a years.
R:  Mm.
L:  And when I got pregnant with my son, he was starting to feel better and thinking about going back to work but then we decided, you know, it would be nice if one of us could stay home so --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- since I was already working, he figured it was -- would be better to stay home than to go and get a job that's just gonna pay for daycare.
R:  Right.
L:  And also, because he didn't know how his health would be he didn't wanna start back with teaching only to have to go on a leave or anything.
R:  Right.
L:  So, it just, kinda, worked out and now he's doing really well but --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- you know, he likes being home with them.
R:  Mhm.  That's good.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] So, it's -- it's a little different, you know?  It's [NOISE] -- I always say, "If I was the one home, people would expect me to have a spotless house and dinner on the table every night and ..."
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, he's home -- people are happy that he just gets [NOISE] through the day without [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- without major [NOISE] disasters happening.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But -- you know?  We -- we work it out. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  [NOISE] When people say, "Oh, you must have a great job that your husband can stay home" and I really don't.
R:  No.
L:  You know?  It's -- we make ends meet but [NOISE] that's about it.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Do you have, um, an extended family?  You said your sister lives near.  What about your parents?
L:  Um, my sister lives not far.  She lives in Staten Island --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- with driving is forty five minutes to an hour.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, my mom lives there too. [NOISE] My father died a few years ago.
R:  Oh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- okay.  I'm sorry to hear that.
L:  But -- and my husband's [NOISE] parents live also, about a half hour away.  So, they're -- it's good 'cause they're close enough that when we need them, you know, they're around. [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  Um, you know, it's -- it's hard 'cause we'd -- they're not close [NOISE] enough that, like, we could just run out to a movie and have them come over and babysit. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But, you know, by the same token, [NOISE] if we have something to do, [NOISE] like, we got invited to a [NOISE] wedding on Saturday --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- his parents [NOISE] were able to come over and watch the kids. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  So, that was really nice.  Are you near your parents or ...?
R:  No.  Actually, both my parents are --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- deceased.
L:  Oh.
R:  My dad died a few months ago and my mother died in ninety three.  So --
L:  I'm sorry.
R:  Yeah.  Because they were so much older.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's -- yeah.  But -- but my siblings, as I said, they're, like, the age that my -- you know, they could be my parents with [LAUGH] most of them.  So --
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  -- I, kind of, feel like I still have parents in a way.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I have three brothers here in Detroit -- in the Detroit area and then one in North Carolina and two sisters --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- are both in Los Angeles.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And that --
L:  Do you get to see them a lot?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  That's good. [NOISE] M- -- I've -- my -- a very good friend of mine grew up in a family -- she was one of eight and she was --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- the second youngest.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Um, and it's not as big an age gap as you have --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I think that there's sixteen years or so between the oldest and the youngest.
R:  Okay.
L:  And they're all pretty nearby.  She gets to see them a lot but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, I used to spend Christmas at her house and it was always a lot of fun and -- and a lot of chaos and [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  You know, I just had the one sister so I -- I always -- you know, m- -- I always thought it would be fun to grow up having a lot of brothers and sisters and she always said the opposite, you know?
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Well, I like the way I grew up with just me and my parents. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Seems as though I had -- always had --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the concept of having --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- brothers and sisters but it was not like other people's fam- --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know?
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
