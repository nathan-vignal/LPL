R:  -- well, I was just thinking about that today, because I'm a social worker and I see all kinds of --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  -- families and family problems, and people who shouldn't be families.  And, although my family was far -- far from perfect, that I think, [MN] ah, anything I've done, it's probably 'cause I've had a pretty solid family structure and a pretty solid family life.

L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  -- because being a social worker I've seen a lot of problems with people --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I've avoided them because of the -- the family structure in the family I've come from.
L:  Yeah.  You know, um, I have like a lot stuff like with my family going on.  I've been in the system before --

R:  Okay.
L:  -- and man, that was a disaster, ew.  I been up in -- I wanted to get out.  I was like up in a cage; that's what it felt like.  [LAUGH]
R:  I worked at a group home and it was horrible.
L:  Yeah, it's just like --
R:  You know, because there's so many things that are wrong with it, that it was -- you know, the people living in a group home I don't think have a chance [LAUGH] to improve.
L:  Yeah, I was in it --
R:  So many chances against them.
L:  Mm.  It was crazy.  I had to be in this facility, it was like fifty females --

R:  Right.
L:  -- everybody sitting eating dinner together --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and that's why I thought it was supposed to be like that --

L:  -- but, you know, and, um, when I got older I found out that, um, my father, you know, who was like raised me --
R:  Huh?
L:  -- he wasn't my real father.  He wasn't my real father --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- you know.  And I always wanted like a mom and a dad, you know, and then my brothers and my sisters around were all happy, but I didn't get that.  I had it rough, you know, I -- I, um -- I sorta -- I raised myself --
R:  I bet you did.
L:  Yeah, I raised myself.  My mom didn't raise me, and [LIPSMACK] you know, no one else.  I had to, you know, on my own and see things and, you know, recognize it on my own.  I didn't get help.  My mother and sis- --
R:  You did everything by yourself, it sounds like.
L:  Yes, by myself.  
R:  Um --
L:  Yeah, my mother just sit down and say well, you know, "You're gonna see this out there.  This is reality".  She didn't explain life to me.  I had to learn on my own and ask questions.
R:  Um --
L:  I learn from friends -- I learn from friends, and from T.V. --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and from different things --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- learn -- and learn it and have to separate, like what's good and what's bad --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know?  So, I had it real hard, you know?  
R:  How are things are going?
L:  And still to this day.

L:  To this day --
R:  Really?
L:  -- it's just still the same -- it's still the same.

L:  -- you know?  And understand --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- them, you know?  And listen to them --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and be there for them, no matter what.  'Cause, you know, if I don't listen to them, they'll go out and do whatever and get themselves hurt.
R:  You are so right.
L:  You know?  And I don't --
R:  You are so right.
L:  -- want that for them.  I do not want them for that.  You know, I'm a nice person.  And also, I've been through so much, I am a wonderful person, and I still respect everybody.  I treat everybody the way that I wanted to be treated, you know?
R:  Well, what was your secret to not getting real bitter and -- and to be a mean person?  What was your secret?  What kept you going?
L:  What kept me going?  Well, um, I'm into god, so, I believe --
R:  Good.

R:  Oh.
L:  -- my mentor when I got out --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and she was there for me, you know, and what kept me going was just being myself --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- just, you know, being myself.  You know, still respecting others and being there for people.  And also --
R:  That is --
L:  I've been through -- also I've been through so much -- not take the anger out on them, you know, and just, um --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- you know, listen to their stories and give them the advice, some good advice that I know, since --
R:  [MN]

L:  Yes.  
R:  [inaudible]
L:  You know, and I had -- I went through counseling and everything, but I also have -- I got -- you know how I got help?  You know how I got it?
R:  How?

R:  Exactly.
L:  -- you know, the -- you always will be miserable for the rest of your life if you don't want the help, you think?  You can't help nobody that don't want to be helped --
R:  You know --
L:  -- so, I wanted the help, so I received it, since I wanted it.  I wanted to change, you know?
R:  You know, pe- --
L:  I wanted to not be upset all the time.  I wanted a good life.
R:  People are gonna --
L:  That's what I wanted.
R:  -- learn so much from you, 'cause I know people that -- that they just g- -- have given up.
L:  Yeah, some people --
R:  But --
L:  -- have, but, you know --
R:  That is so --
L:  -- what kept me strong --
R:  You are --
L:   -- I -- I [LAUGH] have to be strong about it.  I had to be strong, you know?
R:  If I can --
L:  I have to.
R:  If you hadn't had been as strong as you are, you would have been just cr- crushed.
L:  Yeah, this --
R:  You know?
L:   -- what ever. Um, when I hear people disrespecting people --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and probably up in the, um, hospital right now --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- if I didn't have this, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- strongness side about me, you know?  It would have been crazy.  I would probably would have been on drugs, you know, and just --
R:  Right.
L:  -- going crazy and just not caring, you know?  And then that's a waste of a good life, right?
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, I mean, what a gift you're gonna give when you do have children.
L:  Yes, I be there from day o- -- you know what?  If I do have children, they will respect me, you know, they will respect me.
R:  And it sounds like you'll respect them too.
L:  Yeah, I will respect them.  You know, see that's the key right there.
R:  Yep.
L:  You know, the reason why they will respect me, because the respect that I had given them.
R:  Exactly.
L:  You see?
R:  Exactly.  And I see --
L:  So, when I, ah -- I earn that from them, you just can't just, ah --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- well, you have to respect me.  You just can't go up to them like say, "They have to respect me".  You have to earn that from them, just like you have to earn --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- their trust.
R:  You are totally right.  I totally agree with you.
L:  Yes.  You have to earn it.  It's something you have to earn.
R:  Yes.  You know, maybe god has a purpose for all the suffering you went through.  I don't mean to preach to you, but maybe you're supposed to --
L:  No, I feel that way.
R:  -- do some things in life.
L:  Yeah, I feel that way too.  Everybody is here for a reason, though.  Some people don't know, some people don't care, and some people know, you know, they got the sign and they --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- doing it till this day, you know.
R:  Yes.
L:  And, you know, another vice, who I don't understand the psychics, you know?

R:  [LAUGH]
L:  God -- god don't charge.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know?  [LAUGH] So, why?  Why do they want hundreds of dollars if this is how they want to help you.  God don't charge you.

L:  But you want his help.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, so I don't understand that.  [LAUGH]

L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  I agree with you.
L:  Yeah, you know?
R:  You know --
