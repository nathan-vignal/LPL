L:  Hi.  My name is Michele.
R:  I'm Myra.  My daughter's name is Michele.
L:  Oh, is it?  With one L or two?
R:  With two.
L:  Oh.
R:  She says, "Mother, I have hell in my name".
L:  Ahah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm different.  I just have one. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my. [LAUGH]
L:  Nice to meet you.
R:  Nice to meet you too.
L:  So --
R:  So --
L:  -- we're talking about family tonight?
R:  Well, that's m- -- that's amazing because part of my family is -- is on their way to come and see me now.  So, it's a good topic for me.
L:  Oh, that's good.  Where --
R:  Do -- what do you think about family?
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] what does -- w- what was the exact thing?  What does family mean to me, huh?
R:  Right.
L:  Um, I guess my immediate response is, of course, my husband and my children.  But in a more general sense, it's the extended family, of course.
R:  Yes.
L:  Um, my husband and I lived out of state.  We lived down south for ten years and relocated back here less than two years ago.  And now, we're back near grandparents and aunts and uncles and -- so, family for my kids has suddenly become much more larger than it used to be. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  It's a --
L:  They were just people that they saw at Christmas before but now it's, you know, they see people more frequently and it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's neat.  It's good for them to get to know everybody.
R:  I think it's wonderful.  Well, to --
L:  It was the main reason we were willing to take the transfer back because we knew we would be near family and grandparents aren't getting any younger so it was a good move.
R:  S- -- and grandparents need to know the children and the children need to know the grandparents.
L:  Right.
R:  That's something that's ...  You know, my -- my grandmother lived until she was ninety three years old.  I was, ah, almost f- -- well, almost fifty years old when she passed away in f- -- um, which is quite amazing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Not -- not many people at my old age could say that they still had their grandmother around.
L:  Right.
R:  And to me, family is -- is a -- are a unit that needs to stay in touch, needs to be, um, understanding of one another.  I was up in Oregon and my father passed away and my mother was here in California by herself.  So, with me not having any little children -- all my children are all grown --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I have nine grandchildren -- I came home.  I came back to where my mother is and I'm staying with her now just because of the fact that that's what I feel is my job because of the --
L:  Right.
R:  -- fact she is my mother.  She took care of me and checked my diaper.  She was the one that made sure [PAUSE] -- and now she's really sick.
L:  Oh.  That's a shame.
R:  So ...
L:  Well, it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- wonderful that you were able to make the arrangements so that you can be supportive.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I did -- I just dropped everything and came home.  That was it.  Um --
L:  Well, it's sou- -- it sounds like your priorities are in the right place.
R:  [LAUGH] I have a daughter that is -- she has five children and she's now, ah, living here in California and the kids have all [SIGH] -- she -- she is remarried and the kids are all here with her and -- I have old kids. [LAUGH] You know?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  My, ah, middle daughter, she lives here at the house with us.  And, ah, so there's three generations here in this house.
L:  Oh, isn't that wonderful.
R:  And we all get along.  People are amazed at [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- the fact of how well we all get along.  But I think it's whenever you raise the children with the priority that -- that the parents are important.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then as you get older and you need the parents, the -- the children to help you, they have that already instilled.
L:  Right.
R:  That the parents are important.  So, it's -- it's, like [SIGH] ...  And then I have a daughter that's up in Washington and -- and she's got four children so ...  Do you know, it's -- and I think the world of all of 'em.  You know, it's like every -- every chance I get I'm -- I'm on way to either Washington or Oregon and now it's gonna be down to San Diego [LAUGH] and --
L:  That's wonderful.
R:  -- you know, it's -- you know?  So --
L:  You don't see that much any more of the different generations living together.
R:  No.
L:  Um, I know I hear my mother talk, when she was young, there often were relatives living with them.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, of course, she's going back to, you know, Depression era and everything and my grandparents happened to live near a steel plant.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, of course, there was always work there because during the war and so on there was always work.
R:  Sure.
L:  And she always is telling me stories about, "That's when cousin so and so lived with us" and then, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- "Another cousin, you know, they got married and they -- they couldn't afford an apartment or a home so then they rented the third floor for a while.  And then --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- for a while there was an uncle there".  And it just always sounds like such a neat thing to me to think of all these people coming and going.  It's like a -- a children's storybook or something, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  But --
R:  And to think it's your own life. [LAUGH]
L:  -- you don't see that anymore.  And everybody just --
R:  No.
L:  'Cause I've said, "Well, how much work was that for grandma?"  And she said, "But it wasn't.  Everybody pitched in".
R:  No.
L:  And -- and --
R:  But see --
L:  -- the women were home.
R:  Right.
L:  So, a- and they all pitched in and they took turns making meals and it sounds like a big chaotic fun mess, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  And -- and it really is.  And -- and the thing that is -- is -- is as long as each person is recognizing the other person's, um, need to be there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- and nobody is trying to take top priority and -- so, it's my mother's home but you wouldn't know that because she doesn't rule with a iron fist.  She's -- my daughter has her own space, I have my own space and we get together every now and [LAUGH] again in the living room and enjoy each other's company but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- at -- at the same time, we're here for each other.  It's, like --
L:  Right.
R:  "Mom, can you do this for me?"  Or -- or, "Daughter, can you do this for me?"  Or -- you know?  And vice a versa.  We all do for each other when needed.
L:  So, it's a -- a fine balance.  You need to all support each other but you all have to respect each other's privacy and -- and space as well.
R:  Exactly.  And, you know, that is a taught thing.  You need to teach the children.  And this is something that you teach them by i- instilling family values --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- at the very beginning and -- and at a young age.  And you teach them that, you know, elderly -- my mom took me to nursing homes to teach me about elderly because of the fact I was not around a lot of elderly --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- until later, when my [LAUGH] p- -- grandparents got older.  But, you know, I learned to respect elderly by being around them and understanding them and it t- -- it went right into the family thing.  It went --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because when my grandfather got older and I got into elementary school, it was fun for me to go to my grandpas to have lunch.
L:  Right.
R:  I didn't have lunch at school.  I walked two and a half blocks down to my grandpa's house from the time I was in the first grade --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to go have lunch with my grandpa.  And then when he passed away, I had all those good memories of my grandpa.
L:  Right.
R:  And, you know -- and aunts and uncles and cousins.  I mean, we got oodles and scoodles of cousins --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that we have fun getting together with every two years.  We still do it.  We've done it [LAUGH] for years.  You know?  So, family is a very important, very, very valuable thing.  And w- without family, we really don't have anybody other than neighbors, friends, acquaintances.  And usually, family -- they say that -- that, um, blood is thicker than water.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  And I -- I believe that.  I really do. [PAUSE]
L:  I suppose in mo- -- yeah.  In most cases.  Yeah.  Well, I guess there's, like --
R:  I think it depends on your relationship.  How --
L:  Right.
R:  How you have put this relationship together because, um, sometimes it's in our own attitude that causes the problems.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And if somebody else has a problem with us then what we need to do as females, because we're so good at it, is to [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- kinda, figure out what the problem is and -- and work it out to the point to where, "Hey.  Okay.  I know that if I do this little bitty change or that little bitty change, it'll bring them around".  And [LAUGH] what's this little bitty change gonna hurt?  If it's gonna hurt a lot, then you need to sit down and talk to 'em.  But if it's not gonna hurt a lot --
L:  Then just do it. [LAUGH]
R:  Just for the family's sake.
L:  Right.
R:  Just for the --
L:  Right.
R:  -- fact that one day you may need that person.  You never know.
L:  Right.  Or they may need you, right?
R:  Exactly
L:  Right.
R:  And they may be afraid to come to you and -- and then w- when you find out that they c- -- that you could've helped 'em and they were too afraid to come to you because of some, kind of, conflict --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- makes you feel bad. [PAUSE]
L:  I think a- -- um, it's, sort of, ironic.  In spite of modern technology and email and everything else, I -- I think people do a worse job of keeping in touch --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- than they used to even though they have more means.  Ah --
R:  Exactly.
L:  When you mentioned walking to your grandparents, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when I grew up, we walked down the street to my grandparents as well.
R:  Yeah.
L:  My -- my parents lived --
