L:  Josh.
R:  Hi, I'm Carrie.  How are you?
L:  [NOISE] Not too bad.  Yourself?
R:  Good.  Have you ever done this before?
L:  No, I haven't.
R:  I just got of the phone -- I just -- it -- the phone, they just called me and I did one --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and it was so much fun that I went on the Internet and I got my PIN number and I called -- called in to do it again [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, really?  I've ne- -- I've never done this.  This is my first time doing this.
R:  Yeah.  The -- the last person I talked to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- she was an orphan and I had given -- I had been up -- put up for adoption --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, I mean, we really hit it off, it was like, "Oh, my God", we had so much talk -- to talk about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- with family because we don't really know ours and how our searches went and stuff.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Um.  Do you have kids or -- how old are you?
L:  [NOISE] What was that, I didn't hear that last part [LAUGH]?
R:  [LAUGH] Um --
L:  I'm on a cellphone and it's acting kind of weird.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Do you have kids?
L:  Yeah, I got two of 'em, I got a one year old and I got an eight year old.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Boys, girls?
L:  Both boys [SIGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Both boys.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  M- --
L:  They can be a handful.
R:  They must be.
L:  Yeah.  Um, [SIGH] the one -- eight year old, he just got out of school last Friday, so [inaudible] for the summer, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] so now I got both of them home now [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]  Is he protective over the new baby?
L:  [SIGH] Yes and no.
R:  Is he jealous?
L:  I've -- I'm thinking he might be.  I -- I really am.
R:  Yeah, well he spent eight years being the center of attention.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  So that must really, you know, all of a sudden he's -- he's not the center of attention anymore.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, um, he's done all right in school and -- I haven't got his report card yet, though --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so I know how he really did.
R:  [LAUGH] But he said he did good.
L:  Yeah, he said he did good.
R:  So, he probably did.
L:  Yeah.  But ah I don't know, I -- the school up here, where at -- where he goes to school -- it's kind of funny.  I went to school here, the same place he did because we used to live in Cedar Aspens[?] but then we moved to ah another place where I w- -- I grew up and he went to school there, but he don't like it [LAUGH].
R:  Uh oh.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I didn't mind it when I went to school there [LAUGH].
R:  Is it his first year at a new school?
L:  [SIGH] Ah, yeah, but he's been moving ar- -- we've been moving around for a while and it's been you know new school every now and then here and there [SIGH] --
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because I've lived like thirteen different places and I usually don't like it at first --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but if you give it some time then you -- you get adjusted to new friends and new routines and after a while you like it.
L:  Yeah, because we're -- we're getting ready to move again here, shortly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But at least it'll be over the summer, where he won't have to you know g- -- leave school and move school, whatever.
R:  Yeah.  And start a new school being the only new kid isn't too cool.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I know.  I grew up that way, too, for a while, you know, going to different schools and yeah it sucked [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But he's probably learned some good people skills going through that that other people haven't learned.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I -- I -- I think he has.
R:  Yeah, he learns to make friends fast.
L:  Yeah.  Ah -- when I grew up, though, I really didn't have no friends, ah, I was basically a loner anyway.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I did growing up, but now I don't.  I don't know, at forty one I guess you just mellow out.
L:  Yeah.  I'm still kind of a loner either.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Besides, I ain't got a life, really, anyway either, you know, I can't go out and party like I used to, or whatever.
R:  No.
L:  But that's okay [LAUGH].
R:  No.  Responsibility.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] That happens.
L:  That comes first.  That comes first [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  How'd you hear about this, on the computer?
L:  M- -- ah, my wife referred me to this [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Did she find it on the computer?
L:  I think she has --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm not sure.  But ah she signed me up for it with -- without me knowing [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And now I'm doing [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean --
R:  Is she listening?  
L:  No, no, she's on the regular phone calling places right now, calling different apartments and that to see if we find one.
R:  Yeah.  Because she can call in and -- has she got an email with a PIN number?
L:  [inaudible]
R:  And she doesn't -- she doesn't have to wait for a call.
L:  MM.
R:  So, she can call in and do it so I mean that's sixty bucks if you both call in and do it.  I'm going to do it in one day, then I'm going to put my boyfriend on the phone and have him do it [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I even signed my mother up [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, my.
R:  I said -- I just sent her and email and told her, telling her how much fun on the last call.
L:  I mean, what -- what -- what are these phone calls for, though?  I'm -- I'm a little lost on this.
R:  They -- they want to track your voice patterns.
L:  Really?
R:  And they ask where you were gro- -- where you grew up.  So, I'm -- I don't know if it's like because I grew up in Boston they wanted to know if I have a Boston accent or in a -- it's the accent they're interested in or the conversation patterns they're interested.
L:  [MN] [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But -- it's for a college and they're going to learn from 'em.
L:  Oh.  Oh.  Well, I'm from Iowa here and there ain't much here in Iowa [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No accent, no nothing [LAUGH].
R:  No, no, you don't have an accent to me at all.
L:  [LAUGH] But -- but that's -- I don't know, I never knew of any accents anywhere I went, I lived other places.  No one had accents and everything else like that and [SIGH] I mean, what's the deal with that?  You know?
R:  Yeah.  I know that when I go to -- to like Georgia, like the deep south --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they have an accent.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  See, I used to do telemarketing and we'd have to call Georgia all the time to set up phone service and that and -- and the way they talk, sometimes you couldn't even understand 'em --
R:  I know it [LAUGH]
L:  -- but -- but [SIGH] it was --
R:  And you fit --
L:  It was different.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I made -- made my sales and everything, you know.
R:  Yeah.  That's a hard job.
L:  [SIGH] Ah, I -- I don't mind telemarketing, it's just I like the inbound one where they call me.
R:  Yeah, much better.
L:  I -- I don't like the outbound where you call them because that's what I had to do, was outbound for --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to set up the phone service.  But ah -- you know, I did inbound all I did was customer service and then after I fixed whatever phone accounts they had I tried to sell them other items.
R:  Oh.
L:  That was for ah MCI.
R:  Oh, that worked.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because you just made 'em happy because you fixed whatever their problem was.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, then they're more likely to buy something.
L:  Yeah, but then setting up ah pho- -- I worked at a different telemarketing agency setting up the other phone service where I had to call them.  You'd be lucky to get like four sales a day.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.  That -- that was a pain.  But I liked it better when they called me, that way I could just nail it.
R:  [LAUGH] Make friends with 'em and boom.
L:  Yeah.  But ah [SIGH] you know, so where'd you say you were from?
R:  Boston.  Rhode Island right now, but I grew up in Boston.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Really.  Yeah.  [several inaudible words] Iowa.
R:  Wow.  I guess they -- they try to match people from different areas?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.  I -- I wish I knew more about the study --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but it's got to be accents or w- -- why would they ask where you bor- -- brought up, because that's where you get your accent, it's probably where you're -- you know, when you're learning to talk.
L:  Yeah.  Um, it's like mimicry or something like that, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like I'm noticing it with my one year old when he's starting to talk he's just saying words exactly how my wife and I, we say 'em and everything else.
R:  Oh.
L:  So --
R:  That's so cute, though.  That's so sweet.
L:  Yeah.  His new word that he likes saying a lot is "Shut up" [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's -- that's -- that's his new one.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Everything is -- you try to talk to him, "Shut up".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  What a riot [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Let's see, he's starting to learn the other words, some bad words --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but I'm going to try to put an end to that one right now.
R:  Yeah.  It -- it's like you have to learn to catch yourself, oh no, ears are listening [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  He likes the F word [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I -- it seems like they always pick up the bad ones e- -- f- -- they think it's fun to pick up the bad ones because they know they're not supposed to.
L:  All right.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  And he's on a kick now it's not mom and dad, he's calling us by our first names --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so --
R:  He's a smart kid.
L:  Yeah.
R:  He really is.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  I mean, --
R:  You know what, he not only is learning all the words, he's learning what gets you excited.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, how to get a reaction from you.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The words that get the biggest reaction, that's what he's learning [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  And -- he's a smart little boy.  [MN]
R:  Was that him?
L:  Yeah, that's him.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Because I'm standing out on the porch and he loves to go outside and everytime he sees someone head for the door he's got to head for the door, too.
R:  Mm.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  It must be a great age.  Because they're just starting to become people.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's always trying to do what his brother does -- brother does a lot more stuff like ride a bike and everything else -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- he tries to pick up a bike.
