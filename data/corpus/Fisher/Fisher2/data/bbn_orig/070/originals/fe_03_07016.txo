R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  My name's Elise.
L:  Hi.  I'm Trisha.
R:  Hi Trisha.  R- -- how are you today?
L:  I'm fine.  How are you?
R:  Good.  Where do you -- 
L:  So, they said, "What does the word family mean to you? " [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I thought I was talking about family. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  That's what I [LAUGH] thought too. [LAUGH]
R:  Well --
L:  Well, I guess that could mean, basically, the same if we want it to be.
R:  Yeah.  I think so because I think your, ah, family, I guess, is, um, people you live with and your extended family and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- then the people who are close to you that you consider your family.
L:  For me, the word would probably incorporate all of that.  Everybody --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Everybody in your family, um, immediate family and extended.
R:  Yeah.  That's how I feel too.
L:  As well as, possibly, any of your background or something. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  Do you have children?
L:  Ah, I don't.  No.
R:  No.  Okay.  So, then does your -- does family, like -- it just --
L:  Right. Family for me consists of parents, siblings and then extended family.
R:  Okay.  Yeah.
L:  How about you?
R:  I have four kids.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And so [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  And it's -- it --
L:  You sound very young for four kids. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Say -- people are always saying, "You have four kids?"  I say, "Yeah".
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, yeah.  W- -- my whole family, we're all in California.  And then family was, you know, thirty plus people getting together at parties and things --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- which was great.  And then we moved across the country and now there's nobody here.  And that has been an adjustment as far as where you take what your family is and then realize that on our own --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- we're a family by ourselves. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  Which, [SIGH] i- -- we are but still, if the holidays come and we're by ourselves --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it still seems so small. [LAUGH] You know, compared to --
L:  So, out on the West Coast, family was more of the -- the entire group?
R:  Right.
L:  A- and now it's --
R:  It's just us.
L:  I guess now you're on the East Coast and now --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's just your immediate family.
R:  Right.  And -- and it's still family but it's -- it's -- sometimes you s- -- you sit there and it's Thanksgiving, we're all looking at each other [LAUGH].  It's like --
L:  Right. [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay, I guess this is my family and we shouldn't be lonely. [LAUGH] But --
L:  Yeah.
R:  But --
L:  Well, with four kids it's still a -- a decent group.  It's [LAUGH] --
R:  It is.  It's definitely a decent group.  It's -- it's just, um, I don't know.
L:  Not as -- not a- -- what you were used to --
R:  N- no.
L:  -- or the traditional sense of --
R:  No.  And then I feel, you know, w- with having the kids and things, it was nice to have the grandparents involved in their lives and -- and that kind of thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, now, it's only a couple a times a year and, um, I -- I think the whole family grouping is -- is nice for -- for them and for -- even for myself to have the g- -- the mothers, the e- -- the grandparents and the brothers and sisters and everybody.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  Do you have any relatives[?] close to you?
L:  Um, yes.  My parents actually live, um, around.  I'm in Atlanta and, um, the rest of my family is, basically, in the north east.  And, um, we've had some relatives that have moved down here, just a -- a couple of cousins and an aunt and uncle from the north east and that does make it seem, as you say -- like now, we feel like we have more family here because --
R:  Right.
L:  -- we celebrate Thanksgiving with them as opposed to we were just, um, l- -- the three of us before -- well, actually, the four of us -- my sister would -- would come in, um, if she's out of town living in St Louis.  So, um, it somewhat had the opposite effect for a while -- the past few years. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Since we had -- actually had family move o- -- move closer to us.
R:  Coming in.  Yeah.
L:  Um, but when I was younger, family to me was -- I have, um -- up in Massachusetts we were with a lot of, you know -- around the grandparents and the aunts and uncles and everything and cousins.  So, that was more of the extended family --
R:  Right.
L:  -- group at that time.  Um, but I think -- I guess nowadays, just in general, the word family or the concept of family has changed.  People are so much more transient and there are different kinds of families now.  You know, you have --
R:  Right.
L:  -- single moms --
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  -- um, that makes up the family or, you know, partners.  So, family, I guess --
R:  And I think even you incorporate your friends into it where you've -- you know, I've even had my -- some of my friends say and my parents say a- -- you know, against even my friends, they're like, another daughter to me --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or they're like my father to me.  You know, where you get that close even with people who would, ah, e- e- -- you know, with other circumstances, wouldn't even know you.
L:  Right.
R:  But then you've -- they've -- pulled them in and I still have friends that I've had since the sixth grade --
L:  Right.
R:  -- who are as close to me as my sister so it's, um -- I would consider them part of my family also.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But they're not here either. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  Everybody's so far away.  So --
L:  Well, of course, in other cultures, family, you know -- the word family, um, would, I think, more definitely incorporate just that, sort of, extended -- immediate and extended family.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, a- -- we have, like, an Asian, ah, family living up the street and they have, you know, three generations --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- living in the same house.  Um, I think that's pretty common.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I know a lot of -- of the Indian families, um, do that as well.
R:  Yeah.  So, they take care of each other and that's just --
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right.
R:  I know where my parents are there's all the, Hispanic culture --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there and they do that a lot also.
L:  Right.
R:  Or sometimes, they even take in their siblings' children.  I -- I haven't quite figured that one out yet but they -- but they just do.  And I don't know if there -- you know, there's a better job somewhere or they can't take them or, ah, however, but they have all these people raising --
L:  Right.
R:  -- everybody else's kids and it's like no big deal because it's one big unit.
L:  The siblings or, in a way, the grandparents raise the kids.
R:  Yeah.  Or the grandparents.  Yeah.  That's true.  Or they have the grandparents live with them while the grandparents take care of 'em and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- while the parents work or -- yeah.  It's --
L:  Yeah.  I think that probably does have to do with, um -- probably work and that's, ah, some, sort of [LAUGH] maybe job schedule, maybe they have odd hours that they're working or work two or three jobs or something.
R:  Right.
L:  Um --
R:  An- and at least they have -- have that help.  Or sometimes they even bring them from the other countries, you know, to -- to America --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and bring them into their homes even just to get them out of wherever, you know -- or to bring them closer to them and, ah -- 
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  And I tell the people who live around me because, ah -- I'm in Pennsylvania an- and it seems this area that a ton of people, like, went to high school here.  Everybody knows each other still --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- or they haven't moved.  And, ah, all their family is here and the grandparents are here --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a- and, like, you can hear them complaining about this or that or their -- or their -- their families in general and I have to sit there and say, "You don't -- realize how lucky you are to have [LAUGH] them --"
L:  To have that around.
R:  -- close by".  Because I think everybody just takes it for granted and then when you leave --"
L:  Right.
R:  -- i- -- y- y- -- they don't [LAUGH] -- they don't realize that 'cause they go, "Oh, I have to go to my grandparents again" and where my kids are like, "When are we gonna see ours? That's --
L:  Right.
R:  "-- not fair.  How come everybody else is?"
L:  Right.  That's true.  I guess it can be -- it can be, sort of, a blessing and a curse.  Like, a burden --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- but also, you know, a nice -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- a nice thing. [LAUGH] But --
R:  Well, I know our next door neighbors, ah, had -- have -- well, they moved but they had six kids and so I got to be really good friends with their -- the one daughter in law and they had kids and so now my f- -- kids are friends with their kids and it was so unfair to -- to my kids that the grandparents live right next door to us --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and how come their own grandparents couldn't live next door --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- when theirs could?  And it's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- just so hard to try to ex- explain, you know, why y- -- people can't just pick up and -- and move.
L:  Right.
R:  But being that every job, everything now is so transient, as my parents said, you know, "If we moved near you, you'd pick up and leave or --"
L:  You'd just move.
R:  -- if we moved by your sister, you'd pick up and l- -- everybody's --
L:  Right.
R:  "-- just gonna -- " y- yeah.  So, that's what airplanes are for. [LAUGH] You know?
L:  Yeah.  It's just part of this culture I guess and -- I guess, um, you know, family in a way, just, ah -- you know, plus the word just, in general, I guess that would provide, sort of, a sense of comfort or security --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, for a lot of people and if -- if that's not there they, sort of, feel like, you know, there's -- there's --
R:  It's, kind of, a lost feeling.  I just remember --
L:  Right.
R:  -- moving for the f- for the first time a- away -- and I had two kids by that time I moved -- and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I just still remember the awful feeling in my stomach.  'Cause they -- they came with to help us get moved in but then they left and when they left and I was left in a place where I knew nobody --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it -- it [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  It's just like, oh -- oh [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  You know? [LAUGH] What's the --
L:  And yeah and you're, like, "Where's my family?"  And --
R:  I know.
L:  -- they're the only ones. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  And I did it -- the kids were little and so they can't really do much for you [LAUGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- as far as, y- you know, intelligent conversation goes and -- and yeah.  I just -- I didn't like that.  And all I could think is, is this what it's gonna feel like when my kids leave --
L:  Well, that just means --
R:  -- to go to college or l- --
L:  -- you have to be the strong one and set the example for them. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] I'll say, "I did it.  You can do it too".
L:  Well, when you -- yeah, right.  When your kids leave, maybe at that point you can, ah, move close to the other [LAUGH] family.
R:  Well, yeah.  That's -- that's the other thing too is once everybody picks up and goes then -- then where do you go?  And maybe at that point in -- in time --
L:  Well, at least most --
R:  -- you can.
L:  -- if you did want -- and, um -- it sounds like most of your family is in one area, so if you did, at some point, want to move back, you'd be close to all of them.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Um, whereas nowadays, I mean, you know, it seems a lot of families are just -- you got the grandparents --
R:  Yeah.  They're --
L:  -- in one state, the siblings in another, the cousins in [LAUGH] another.
R:  Right.  My sis- -- my brother's -- was near my parents.  My sister is in Florida but her husband's military --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, they're r- -- every two to three years, they're setting[?] somewhere else.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  So, and the closest she was to me at any given point was still e- --
