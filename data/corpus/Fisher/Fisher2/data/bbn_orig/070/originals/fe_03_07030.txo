L:  Hello.  My name is Mark.
R:  Hi.  My name's Lindy.
L:  Lindy, our topic today is family and what it means to you.  I don't know about you, but I come from a very large tight knit clannish family.
R:  Yeah, I do too.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yep, very.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, so, ah, tell me, how many million sisters and brothers do you have.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Actually, I guess mine isn't that large [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I have, um, well, I'm pre- -- I have an extended family.  I've got, um, one sister and then I've got two stepsisters, a stepbrother, but my ste- -- one of my stepsisters and my stepbrother were raised with me --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- 'cause my parents, um -- my mom got divorced and my stepdad got divorced, and then they each had their own two kids, and had custody of 'em, so it was kind of like a Brady Bunch thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then my dad remarried somebody who had kids [LAUGH], so, ... it's kind of one of those, but --
L:  On, ah -- in my family, my parents decided that, ah -- to have six kids --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- and that wasn't enough for 'em, um, they, ah, [LAUGH] -- we -- there was always ex- -- it was one of those, ah -- the house in the neighborhood where all the kids went to --
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  -- and there was always one or two extra kids from troubled families either staying with us, or my sister's best friend, and she stayed for about five years, or --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- or the -- the longest line of rotating foreign exchange students who've ever studied.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And my father came from a even larger family --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- which was also very clannishy[?], ah, there were nine children in his family --
R:  Oh, my god.
L:  -- and he's the identical twin, I mean, we're talking mirror identical twin --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- and, so, that -- that -- there's a whole lot of scarring issues there, let me tell you.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, I have, counting both aunts and uncles on both sides of my mom and my dad's family, I have approximately twenty five uncles and aunts, and ... of my immediate first cousins, I used to have twenty eight, but we are now down to twenty six.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  And I -- I can't tell you how many third cousins or fourth cousins I have, but I know a lot of them 'cause -- 'cause my dad decided, "Oh, why don't we have a family reunion?".  He put me in charge, and so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and apparently somebody had done a lot of work on the family tree, so we were able to, ah -- seven generations --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- of descendents, so it was couple hundred, or, oh, it was -- anyway, but most of m- my immediate siblings, you know, we were brawn -- born very close together, so we are very tight, and we all live very close to each other for the most part.
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  Isn't that nice?
R:  Yeah.  My, um -- actually between my brothers and sisters we are all in different states.  So, I've got -- my brother's in Florida, and then I have a sister in North Carolina, a sister in Virginia, um, so everybody's spread out.
L:  Oh, so, when, ah, w-, o-, um, i- it would be, ah, too intrusive to say whether or not you got married at this point in time, or if you're seeing somebody?
R:  Oh, no, I'm married, yeah.  And I have -- I have a daughter of my own.
L:  Oh, you do?
R:  Yeah.  I have -- she's going to be a year next -- this month actually.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.  Well --
R:  So, yeah.
L:  -- that's nice.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I'm married w- as well, and every time one of us gets married, it's a real, like, trial by fire for that poor individual --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because, we have our -- we get together for li- -- for like birthdays --
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  -- and there's like a birthday every month.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, so, if we're like -- at minimum twelve of us get together, and it's more like thirty.  And so you say, "Oh, let's -- come meet the family", and they're not meeting just mom and dad, they're --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- meeting this whole c- noisy boisterous crowd of people.
R:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Same on your side?
R:  Yeah, pretty much.  I don't see them quite as much anymore.  My, um -- my brother actually married my best friend, and --
L:  Oh, that's gonna be good.
R:  Yeah.  So, that was kinda nice.  [LAUGH] And, um -- but then they've moved to Florida.  I'm actually -- w- we see them probably a couple of times a year maybe.  Those are the ones that I'm closest to -- with my brother and his wife, um, 'cause they've also -- they're the only -- they're the only other kids that have their own kids.  My brother's got two year olds, or actually they're four now -- four year old twins.  [LAUGH] So, um, we see them, um -- but, yeah, it's [LAUGH] -- and my -- my poor husband he just kinda -- he just kinda set up camp.  [LAUGH] He like moved in --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- everybody just -- he's real quiet --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and so, everybody just took to him [LAUGH] right away.
L:  Oh.  Did he come from a smaller family, or ...?
R:  Yeah, he -- well, he's got a sister and a brother, but, um, his family's really different.  They're not as close knit as my family is.  I mean it's like we don't -- just even now, we don't go down there a lot or spend a lot of time with his family like we do with mine.  They just don't seem --
L:  You know, my wife is the same way.  About the most she'll do is a phone call maybe once a month, but generally just the -- the birthday.  I mean, cards --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- are very import- -- you don't miss an occasion with a card --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know -- you know.  You can ignore the other person for the rest of their life --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so long as they get a birthday card --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  --  a mother's day card [LAUGH] --
R:  That's right.  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Well, and his parents have like -- they make more of an effort to -- to see us now that we have a daughter, 'cause they want --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- to see her.
L:  -- the grandkid factor.
R:  Yeah.  And -- and it's funny, 'cause that's really changed them, 'cause his mom was always real kind of different towards me, and just not real accepting, I guess.  And, um -- and now that I have my daughter she's just like right there.  [LAUGH] 
L:  You're -- you're --
R:  She's so --
L:  -- in the club.
R:  Yeah.  She still makes her little snide remarks, but not quite as bad as they used to be.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] So, but -- yeah, mo- -- and -- and it's funny how when you get married --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- y- -- that -- that other side of the family.  I -- the whole in law thing has really [LAUGH] -- just kind of moving into somebody else's family is a very strange concept to me [LAUGH] I guess.
L:  I had to almost force my wife to drag her family in.
R:  Really?
L:  Oh, it was -- you know, it -- she had -- she's very independent from her family and ... she has one sister, but there's a twenty age year difference.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And she's -- her sister's graduating --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- from high school --
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  Yeah, really.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And it's hardly -- her -- th- their family -- her family communicates with these long gaps of silences.  The longer the silence, it has a totally different meaning than a short silence.  I'm not kidding.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, god.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Now, I'm kind of -- I'm kinda different.  Of all my siblings, my wife and I, we decide not to have children.
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  Because we figured unless you have a burning desire to have a kid, oh god, don't, you know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Well, and you're right, you know.  A lot of -- eh, my sister -- one of my -- my younger sister, whose, um, twenty six, you know, she -- it's funny to me, because she was the one who always grew up babysitting and loved kids and everything, and she has turned into this goal oriented career woman that I don't think she's gonna have kids.  And, you know, that's what makes her happy, so ... but, she's real -- she's --
L:  Does she get picked on because of it?  
R: Does --
L:  Like --
R:  No.  No, um --
L:  -- like my brother, Stan, he's the last remaining bachelor and -- and all because there's -- there's this big thing about family names in my family --
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  -- like, ah, there's this certain first name, William, is always passed along t- to -- to every generation.  It has been for the last seven generations, right?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but no one -- you know, none of the grandkids has been named William yet.
R:  Oh.
L:  The wives have won all the arguments on that thing.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, my brother Stan, since I've decided not to have kids, he's stuck.  If he's gonna have a kid, it's gotta be called William.
R:  Hm.
L:  [LAUGH] You know.
R:  Unless he has a girl, I hope.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Meanwhile, you know, he's -- he's just -- he's still dating right now, you know.  He's -- he is gonna be forty next year and he's still dating.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yo- you know, but --
R:  He must hate bringing women around right now.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, he's just into -- he just got a new girlfriend about, ah, six months ago, and she's managed to, you know, make it through a couple of family events --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so, that's nice.  I -- it will be nice to see whether or not this relationship works out for him.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] I know, it's funny to watch all your sisters and brothers that you've grown up with.  It's funny to watch how they are when they get in relationships and, you know --
L:  Yeah, they're a lot nicer to their spouses than they ever were to you, right.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  Yes.  [LAUGH] Yes.  [LAUGH] 
L:  'Cause, you know, my brothers and sisters, we were always very verbal with each other, I mean, ha, you know, talk about -- and -- and physical.  Talk about, you know, fights and -- and catfights and brawls, you know.
R:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  But, you know, sort of like, you go to the table, you don't mention anything, and then if you want to pick it up later on, okay fine, but it's sort of like a very quick and forgiving --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- like nature.
R:  Yeah, which is good.
L:  But I find that my wife's side of the family isn't like that at all.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They're like -- they're like elephant.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They can remember every, "So, so what?  Didn't send me a birthday card back ..." --
