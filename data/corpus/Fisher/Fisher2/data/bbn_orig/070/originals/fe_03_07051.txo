R:  Oh, hi. [LAUGH]
L:  Hi.  So, um -- so, we're supposed to talk about family.
R:  Yes.
L:  Have you done this before?
R:  I did it one time, um, it's probably been about three months ago.
L:  Me too. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  This is only the second time I've ever done it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Ho- --
R:  I didn't like the first topic I had to talk about. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  But this one will be good. [LAUGH]
L:  Good.  So, well, um, [LIPSMACK] my family consists of -- I've been married nineteen years --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- and I have two teenage boys, sixteen and thirteen and, um, I'm a homemaker but I have home b- -- I have two home businesses that I run.
R:  Oh.
L:  So ...
R:  That sounds interesting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  How long have you been in the, um, home business?
L:  Um, one of 'em I've done for a couple of years and, um, my other home business I just started in the last three months.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, they're businesses, like, um -- I do home interiors.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.
L:  And I also do a business called Gabby Goodies, which is coffee and tea and --
R:  Oh, that sounds interesting.
L:  -- all kinds of gourmet stuff.  I love it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So -- and my kids help me.  They'll go door to door selling the candles and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So --
R:  That --
L:  -- it's fun.
R:  That sounds fun.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, well I've been married for, let's see ... going in to my sixth month. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, you're a newlywed.  How sweet.
R:  Yeah.  Well, we lived together for seven years.
L:  Oh.
R:  And then we just decided, you know, we needed to get married now after two kids. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, our kids are, um -- my son will be six in a couple of weeks and then my daughter is two and a half.
L:  Oh.
R:  And then I have three stepdaughters and they're sixteen, twelve and eleven.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, um, we have a pretty blended family. [LAUGH]
L:  So, do they all live with you?
R:  No.  Um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  We get his daughters every other weekend.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, um --
L:  So, you're, kinda, running the full gamut of teenagers and a two and a half year old in the house.
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  Are any --
R:  So --
L:  -- of your teenagers driving?
R:  Ah, the sixteen year old is practicing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  Mine just got his license last September.  It's like, oh -- oh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] But it has made it nice.  He takes movies back to Blockbuster and when -- he gets the milk.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  That's the nice thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Can you run to the store and get some milk for me? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  So, family is really important for us too.  We do a lotta family things.  We're, kind of, homebodies.  We rent videos and --
R:  We do too.  A lot.
L:  -- spend time with our family.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Um, I'm also a homemaker.  Um --
L:  Oh, how neat.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I, ah --
L:  It's a hard job.
R:  It is.  It is.
L:  It is. [LAUGH] It's a hard job.
R:  I quit --
L:  So --
R:  -- working after my daughter was born and, um, I -- I had my son in daycare and h- -- I just hated it.  I would cry almost every day when I'd have --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- to drop him off 'cause he didn't like to go and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I thought, you know, I don't wanna have to do that to my daughter if I don't have to so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we, ah ... You know, sometimes it's been, kind of, tight, you know?  But --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, I think it's worth it.
L:  It's so worth it though.  It is.  And, you know, I kept thinking, "Okay, well, when my kids get old enough, I'm gonna go back to work" and you know what?  It's like there's never the good time because, um, once they start driving and having girlfriends and stuff, you don't wanna have an empty house for them to come home to.
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  You don't know what [LAUGH] they're gonna be doing.
R:  Oh, definitely.
L:  You know?  It's just -- it's just as important when they're teenagers that the mom still needs to be around.
R:  Mhm.  I agree.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  And, um, you know, I -- I wanna be here when they get home off the bus and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- fix them a snack of whatever and --
L:  Well, yeah.  And I tried working for a while, um, [LIPSMACK] I'd, ah -- well, I w- -- had worked all up until I had kids and then I tried working a couple a times while they were growing up and it just was so hard.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, doing homework at nine and ten at night and it just doesn't work.
R:  Oh, w- --
L:  It doesn't work for us.  I could never make it work. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, yeah.
R:  I, ah -- when, ah -- my mom, her boyfriend has a kettle corn business and, kind of --
L:  I love that stuff.
R:  -- travels to different things. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Have you been trying to do it?
R:  Well, he came here for a couple of carnivals and I worked the weekends for him and it was nice 'cause, you know, it was some extra money --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but my husband was about to go nuts 'cause --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- he's not used to being alone with the kids and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, so he ha- has a new appreciation for you?
R:  I think so. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, w- -- well, we have a --
R:  Although --
L:  We have a lot in common.
R:  We do.
L:  Do you have an email address before they click us off?
R:  Yes.  It's A. Harlan -- H.A.R. -- I'll -- I'll s- -- do the whole thing -- A. H.A.R.L.A.N. --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- at Cox dot net.
L:  Okay.
R:  Okay.  And what's yours?
L:  Mine's K.C.I.U.L.L.A. at --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- S.B.C. Global dot net.
R:  Okay.
L:  I'll send you some information about my coffee business because it's mainly run online.
R:  Oh.
L:  People can order through PayPal.  It's really -- it -- it's been really nice for my family.
R:  Oh, great.
L:  You know, I bring in a little extra money.  I mean, I'm not gonna get rich but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And we drink coffee and teas and my --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- my teenagers eat me out of house and home so I'm --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- always making something. [LAUGH] Huh.  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] I -- I've been wanting to look for something too that, you know, I can do out of the home through our computer and stuff and --
L:  Yeah.  I know.  You got a computer so it's like you might as well try to make some money, huh?
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's what I keep thinking.  Like, okay, I'm gonna try this.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, wow.  So, you have, like, five kids all together?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, and then do you have, like, immediate family that lives around you? Like, grandmothers and grandfathers and ...
R:  Um, actually no.  Ah, I have a lot of family in Missouri.
L:  Yeah.
R:  My mom lived here until about a year ago and, um, she moved to Kansas City, which is, like, three and a half hours from me.
L:  Yeah.  'Cause you're in Kansas?
R:  And I just cried and cried.  Huh?
L:  You're in Kansas?
R:  Yes.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I'm in Wichita.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, so -- but I have two brothers that live here and they have kids also so we --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- all get together for birthdays and, you know, just --
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  -- stuff like that.  So, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I'm in Southern California and all of my family is in Northern California, which is, like, ten hours away.
R:  Oh, man.
L:  So, yeah.  So, we've been -- we've lived out here about eleven years so all of our family -- we travel -- or have to travel back and forth to see each other.
R:  Oh.
L:  So --
R:  Yeah.  That's a long distance.
L:  Yeah.  Or make lots of long distance phone calls and -- well, now my parents finally got a computer so now we're able to email back and forth.  It makes it so nice.
R:  Oh.  Yeah.  And cuts down those long distance phone calls. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  It does.  It does.  Definitely.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So --
R:  Oh, yeah.  I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I miss my mom though being that far away from me.  'Cause I've, you know, never been away from her for too long but [LAUGH] --
L:  It's hard.
R:  -- I'm getting used to it. [LAUGH]
L:  It's hard.  You know what?  I've ending up having to have, like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, [LIPSMACK] friends and, um, other family members that are just, kind of -- like, we adopt them as [LAUGH] family members, you know?
R:  Yes.
L:  So, to have people around and stuff.  But --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- yeah.  I understand that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So --
R:  And then, um, my dad, he passed away six years ago so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it's, um, been, kind of, ah, difficult trying to adjust to her having a boyfriend and all [LAUGH] that. [LAUGH]
L:  That would be hard.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  You -- how -- I'm forty one.  How old are you?
R:  Twenty nine.  I'll be thirty this year.
L:  Oh, you're so young.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] H- --
R:  I don't feel like it. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  But --
L:  Thirty was hard for me.
R:  But I think --
L:  Like --
R:  -- I'm probably gonna cry this year. [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, but you know what?  Forty was, like, no big deal.
R:  Oh.
L:  It's, like, okay.  Whatever.
R:  That's comforting.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Time just keeps flying.  Whatever. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, yeah.  And my --
R:  So, are --
R:  -- parents are getting ready to retire in January and they're gonna m- move, um, about three hours away from me.  So --
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  -- that'll be nice.  Yeah.  We'll be driving --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- back and forth a lot I'm sure.
R:  Oh.  That's nice.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm looking forward to that.  My mom's a, um, recovering, um, breast --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- cancer survivor.
R:  Oh, wow.  That's great.
L:  So, for, um, four years.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  So, it'll be nice to have her close.
R:  Yes.
L:  Then I could take care of her for a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- while.  My sister's been doing all the care taking, you know, when my mom was sick and everything and I would go as much as I could but with kids in school and stuff, it was hard.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So, she's doing --
R:  Does she --
L:  -- good now.
R:  Does she have to do chemo and radiation?
L:  She had to do all of it.  Yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  She did.
R:  Did she have to get a mastectomy?
L:  She had to get a mastectomy and she had a really aggressive, ah, cancer so they --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- she had a lot of chemo and a lot of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- radiation.
R:  Oh.
L:  But she came a through and she's -- so far, she's cancer free four years.  So --
R:  That's wonderful.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  It's a praise.  Yeah.
R:  I can, kind of, relate, um, a little bit.  I don't know what you went through or anything but my dad died of cancer.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, um, you know, I have a -- that's one of my big things I really, you know, care about is, you know, cancer patients and things like that and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, I just, actually, donated thirteen inches of my hair in January to the Locks of Love.
L:  Oh, that is --
R:  So --
L:  -- such a sweet --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- program.  I love that program.
R:  Oh, I think it's wonderful.
L:  Oh, how neat.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So -- so, somebody has a new head of hair because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of you.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's really nice.
R:  My husband wasn't too crazy about me doing it but [LAUGH] --
L:  Ah, y- -- c- -- hair no- --
R:  My hair grows so fast.
L:  Why do men always like long hair?  I don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, they do. [LAUGH]
L:  They do.  Well, I do too.  I've got my hair short but I'm --
