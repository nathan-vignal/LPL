R:  Hello, my name is Derek.
L:  Hi Derek.  I'm Adrienne.
R:  Hi, Adrienne.
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Oh.
R:  [several inaudible words] 
L:  So, what family means to -- to me [LAUGH] this sounds like one of those high school topics.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I know, I know.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] gosh.  I guess it means people I know I can rely on.
R:  Mhm.  So, less of a -- less of a bloodline, more of a ah, social type thing.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.  Although, it is convenient like my mother tells me how she responds to different medications and then like I don't have to be as trial and error with stuff.
R:  Right.  Right.  I think -- I think for me ah my big thing is I lived with my family in a small town all my life until last year ah so I had to rely on my family because there -- there were more people around, but still my family was really in close proximity to me and then I moved across the country now, so now I'm more alone and ah have to meet my own family and kinda, you know, I can talk to other people over the phone, my -- my real family but I have assimilated a new family in my new environment.  Exciting, huh?
L:  So, that's neat.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's neat.
R:  It's -- it's different.  But ... so, back to the family.  Hm.  Medication.  We determine our medication from our family members.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  What's safe for us and what's not.
L:  Huh?
R:  What's safe for us and what's not.
L:  Exactly, yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And ah yeah, it's interesting.  Um, since I was at [inaudible] I'm the only child --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- but like my mother and I have like the same exact size foot so like we can share shoes and like there are all these little ways in which we're like so like identical, it's so funny.
R:  Mhm.  According to our DNA.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Is this your first call?
L:  This is my third.
R:  Your third already?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  This is my first one.  So --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- a little strange.
L:  Yeah.  Where are you from?
R:  I'm from a -- I'm in Tucson, Arizona right now.
L:  That is so cool.  I'm in Philadelphia.
R:  Really?  Yeah, I'm from New York.  From upstate New York, of course.  Where there are less people and more green rolling hills.
L:  Hm.
R:  I like Philadelphia, though.  Hectic driving from what I've -- what I've garnered.
L:  Yeah, I just have my bike up here now.
R:  Yeah that -- that -- that's how I'd like to be, ideally, but ...  Family won't permit it.  Well, I'm just trying to tie the conversation back into family, I guess.
L:  Oh, yeah.  It's true that you can make like I guess what I hadn't realized is when I lived in with my boyfriend he became more family to me than my actual blood family.
R:  Oh, definitely.  Yeah, yeah.  That's -- I live with my girlfriend as well, so you know mom becomes a little close and the -- the s- --
L:  How did your mom respond to that?  Mine was a little tiffy for a while.
R:  Mine didn't -- mine didn't really think I was leaving because what I did was I kind of just up and went by myself.
L:  Oh.
R:  And I -- I had actually considered going to school um in Philadelphia and in New York City and they were like, "Oh, okay" and then I kind of backed out from that because I wasn't sure and I had -- I had kind of a girlfriend at the time and I didn't know if I wanted to leave her or not --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and then one day I just decided, "Well, I can't keep telling people I'm going to leave and not leave, so I'll go to Arizona" and they didn't really think I was leaving until the night before [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Strangely.  Yeah, packed up the car and left.  But I'm still close to all of them, I suppose.  Talk to them on the phone twice a week; it's about as close as I can get.  Go home during Christmas.  Standard stuff.
L:  Ah, yeah.  I hate holidays, personally.  Although I love --
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  -- my family, I hate holidays because the expectations are just so high.
R:  Mhm.  And you have a limited amount of time and you want to get in things but then you don't want to get in anything because it's just kind of awkward.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Hm.
L:  But, let's see.  Family, family, family.  Ah, do you want to have a family?
R:  Um, I'm twenty three and I'm mature in a lot of aspects, I mean I'm -- I'm nearly a teacher, but at the same time I'm immature in a lot of aspects.  So, I don't think I have the responsibility for a family right now.  I'm starting off with dogs, though.  I have two dogs --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that's my -- that's my family.
L:  Yeah.  I love dogs.  Yeah.  So, yeah, like but do you think that like you want to have them eventually?
R:  Oh, eventually, yeah.  But I think --
L:  I don't.
R:  You don't?  Wow.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, we're talking about kids primarily?
L:  Yeah.  W- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah, we're talking about kids.  Just because it's like, I don't know, I guess I'm so selfish I'm like, what am I going to get out of it?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I feel like I'd have to give up so much like of my leisure activities and I don't know.
R:  Do you think you might calm down eventually, though, and less time for leisure is okay?
L:  [LAUGH] Um, well, I guess that's what people have told me for a long time.  Like it's -- it's so shocking to a lot of people that like a female wouldn't want to have kids, I think.  And ah it's -- it's very unsettling.  People start like thinking in their head, well, what's wrong with her [LAUGH].  You know.
R:  Oh, I don't think so at all.  You have to carry most of the burden, or at least eighty percent of the burden.  So, it should be your choice.
L:  Well, yeah, I mean still women do like a lot more of the chores, I guess and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- y- --
R:  But just even carrying the kid and just ah -- I couldn't imagine doing it myself.  Just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that whole physical aspect of it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Whereas a man just kind of steps in and cuts the umbilical cord and you know that's kind of scary to me [NOISE] that's -- that's my child.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it's amazing how pets can become part of the family and they get --
R:  Oh, definitely.
L:  -- Christmas presents and everything.
R:  Mhm.  They have birthday parties too.  That's -- that's even more unsettling for a lot of people.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Yep.  
L:  So --
R:  Hm.  This eight minutes is not going as fast as they said it would.
L:  Well, family's a hard topic, I think.
R:  It is.  It's kind of personal --
L:  Because it's so --
R:  -- with everyone.
L:  It is very personal.  It's very personal.  Um, yeah, so --
R:  Do you know your f- -- ah, extended family tree?  Because I have no idea.
L:  You don't?  Are you curious, like ...?
R:  No, I'm really not that curious.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  When people ask me like what heritage I am, I'm like, I don't know, Irish and German and English I supposed.  You know, but I can't really trace it back to that -- that destination from where they came to America and that kind of stuff.
L:  It's nice to have some mystery about your bloodline.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.  Because then you can think, "Well, maybe I could be partly this or that", you know, like --
R:  Related to so and so, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Like maybe I could have some gypsy blood.  Who knows?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Or something that I consider exciting.  But if I knew like no, all your ancestors were Irish and Welsh and that's it, you know, it's kind of like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's in some ways limiting to the imagination.
R:  Definitely.
L:  So, um, yeah, I know a -- a lot more about my mom's side of the family --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- than I do about my dad's.  Um, yeah.  And -- and we don't really -- my family isn't really that connected.  Like we're not the kind of family that like writes a lot of letters or makes a lot of phone calls.  Like I'm the big person for that and that's like a bad sign.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um, [LIPSMACK] yeah, it's kind of -- yeah, I do feel like we're -- we don't know a lot about each other.
R:  Hm.  Same here, same here.  Even though we all grew up together, I'm sure ah since I moved out I'll be kind of cut off.  You know, I -- I don't get the ah breaking gossip and all that good stuff from my grandma and all that.  All that silly stuff.  I'm just going to form my own new [inaudible] out here.
L:  So, you have brothers and sisters?
R:  I have one little sister who -- she's kind of the opposite of me, um, I've always kind of been independent and tried to like get my own money and things like that and she's nineteen and she's never had a job.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, I've -- I've kind of resented her for that and she's always been like that, so I've never really talked to her [LAUGH] which is -- is strange.  I lived with her for seventeen years and I never talked to her.
L:  [SIGH] I don't know if that's strange.  I have a step father and while I lived in the house I mean we basically ignored each other.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That was our strategy.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] For like -- like cohabitating well like not really being that thrilled about one another --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so um yeah, and I always thought that was so weird, but I guess it -- it's not.
R:  No.  Ah, I just wonder if over time maybe I will talk to her, you know, when the parents get sick or something; I don't know.  But I assume we'll live on different coasts now.  So, perhaps not.
L:  So, you feel like -- is sh- -- things are lot easier on her because she was a girl, or ...?
R:  Um, I -- I was always a momma's boy in a sense.  I was always really close to my mother --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so it -- it was like daddy's girl versus momma's boy.  So, I don't -- I don't think it was actually easier, it's just right now like I had -- I got a job when I was fifteen years old and with her being nineteen and never having a job I just don't -- I don't understand it and I don't identify with it at all.  And I don't see how she gets away with it, having the same parents.  But I don't know.  It doesn't -- doesn't directly affect me, I suppose.  I just wonder.
L:  So, did you enjoy working or -- because I worked and I kind of didn't like it?
R:  Um, I didn't like it but I also I -- I learned a lot of life's lessons early on.  Versus --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- learning it later about people and social situations and things like that.  It was good to get it out of the way and learn and plus um the first time you earn something you -- you earn a lot of money and you buy something big, there's just ah --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- there's just a huge satisfaction in that. 
L:  Like a car or something?
R:  Well, not even -- like a stereo, you know.  So- -- something even like a hundred dollar purchase.  When you first have like a hundred dollars in your pocket, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you're used to getting a ten dollar bill and being like, "Wow, a ten dollar bill" but then you -- o- -- once you hit the hundred and then the thousands it kind of loses it's momentum, but the first time you do it it's -- it's certainly gratifying.
L:  Yeah.  I've never been good at that.  I guess because I set my goals too high.  I think of things like I -- I w-- decide I want a fur coat --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I tried so hard to like save up the money and I never could get it, but that's like ten thousand dollars --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- so -- so maybe I should start small like a stereo --
R:  There you go.  Or even your own CDs.
