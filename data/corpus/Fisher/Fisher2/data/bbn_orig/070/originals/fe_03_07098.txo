L:  [NOISE]  He- --
R:  Hello?  Yeah.
L:  --  Hello!  Hi, --
R:  Yes?
L:  -- this is Jenny.
R:  Yeah, this is John Fong.  [LAUGH]  Nice to talk to you.  Yeah.
L:  Nice -- nice to talk to you.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  Where are you calling from?
R:  I'm --
L:  Where are you?
R:  -- [SIGH] I'm calling from California, yeah.
L:  Oh, you're in California.  Well, I'm in Texas so there's [SIGH] -- there's a little space in between us, so --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think so.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, the topic is, ah, corporate conduct in the US, right?  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Right.
R:  Yeah, that's a very serious one.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  So, -- so, ah, what's your opinion on -- on this topic?
L:  A- ah, I think that, ah, it has really gotten out of hand, that there needs to be ... more check points.  [SIGH]  Ah, --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- [SIGH] that it -- it seems like that, ah, [SIGH] -- they had gotten to a point that they --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- thought that they were above the law.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [MN]  So, I think that there really does need to be more ch- checks and balances there to -- to keep, ah, [SIGH] -- keep the larger companies in line just like us little people have to s- [LAUGH] stay in line.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Because I think the -- the large corporations, ah, [SIGH] [NOISE] --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- have too much power today.  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  Right.
R:  Because I'm working, you know, very -- for -- for very big, a- ah, [SIGH] company.  Ah, it has all kinds of resources.  [SIGH]  If there is no control it can just, ah, do a- anything, yeah.
L:  Yeah, can do just pretty much what they please.  Like I said I think they're -- that they kind of feel like they're above the law, that [SIGH] -- that rules and regulations don't apply to them except for the r- rules that they make, you know.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  And if that doesn't seem to suit them well then they -- they go in another direction but, ah, [SIGH] there needs to be some more checks and balances on them, ah, I really do believe.  [SIGH]  So, ...
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  [SIGH]  And, ah, -- on -- on the question that how have the scandals affected ah -- ah -- ah, me?  Ah, [SIGH] I -- I think it's like this, um, [SIGH] ah, the influence is indirect because I'm not in a -- a corporate, ah, leadership position so, ah, it -- ah, it +doesn't affect me directly.  But, ah, indirectly, [SIGH] of course, I think, ah, that contributes, ah, to t- the stock market, ah, downturn.  [SIGH]  And does that a-  [SIGH] affect me, ah, financially?  [LAUGH]  That -- that's for sure, yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  I- it affects all areas as far as I'm concerned.  Ah, [SIGH] it doesn't just affect one, ah, -- when the -- when the stock market goes up and down or when they pull the little things that they do.  [SIGH]  It affects a- all the economy, I mean, all the way down it affects down to [SIGH] -- to your everyday living.  It -- it's, um, -- it's what I call the domino affect and, ah, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and once it starts though it's not just, ah, -- [MN] it's just not one thing that's involved.  You just -- ah, one leads to another and, ah, [SIGH] it's hitting me in the pocket book, I know that personally that it -- it's hitting me in the pocket book and I can't afford it.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And -- and also [SIGH] I -- I think it will, ah, ah, [SIGH] ah, adversely affect, ah, people's, ah, confidence, ah, in the whole financial, ah, s- systems, ah.  [SIGH]  The ordinary investor will ask, ah, is -- is it just a game that the bigger investors, or corporations, are playing with ordinary people, yeah?  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  You know, because they have a -- a- a- a- all the money and the lawyer [SIGH] on t- their side.  The +other investors [NOISE] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- h- h- h- have nothing [SIGH] to fight with them.  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  Okay.  So, ...  [SIGH]
L:  But, ah, yeah, it's, um -- but like I said, you know, it affects [SIGH] -- it affects all of us.  It's not just a -- [SIGH] if it's a game to them they need to realize that their game is a very costly one.  [SIGH]  But I don't know I just kind of get the feeling that they -- they really don't care about anybody but themselves.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, I -- I've read quite a few articles on -- ah, [SIGH] the upper echelon in the big corporations and all and they -- to me they seem to be very self centered and --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] really care nothing for what they call the little people --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- and that's me.  [MN]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  [SIGH]  But, um, the second question [SIGH] ah, does a- a- a- cascade of corporate, ah, scandals cause, ah, recession and, ah, [SIGH] the downturn in the, ah, stock market and the economy?  [SIGH]  I don't think, ah, the scandals themselves, ah, directly, [SIGH] ah, contribute.  [SIGH] I -- I mean as a major, ah, cause of the, ah, recession I don't think so.  [SIGH]  In fact it's like this, ah, when the economy goes bad [SIGH] and, ah, the investors, ah, -- ah, more and more, un- unhappy they trying to find out, ah, what's going on.  [SIGH]  And, ah, then when more scandals are -- are disclosed, ah, it should be, ah, this way.  Although, [SIGH] of course, when the scandals are +discovered [SIGH] they contribute to further, maybe, downturn.  [LAUGH]  That's my reasoning.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  Do you agree with me?  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Ah, well I see your point on it.  Ah, I -- [SIGH] I think that everything has to be brought out into the open because the confidence of the people in the United --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] States now, a- ah -- they ... really they don't have much faith in the -- [SIGH] in -- especially the big companies but also [SIGH] it's affecting us on the world market not just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a- ah, as far the United States is concerned, it affects, ah, how people think of it as far as the world is concerned.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  And, a- ah, when we lose the confidence of, you know, of our allies and all out in the, [SIGH] ah, beyond our shores well t- then we're --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in serious trouble.  [SIGH]
R:  Okay.  Okay.  Okay, because, ah, for example [SIGH] at the top of the, ah, dotcom boom, ah, nobody +cares what is the, ah, [SIGH] big corporate -- ah, corporations are doing, [SIGH] only if the -- the -- [NOISE] they're stock is going up but, ah, now people are more and more, ah, careful [SIGH] about, ah, what the companies are -- are doing.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I think we were awfully gullible because we just believed everything that we were told instead of, ah, [SIGH] -- ah, really, you know, asking for the checks and balances on it.  [SIGH]  And that's something that's gonna have to be corrected because it's -- [SIGH] it's been proven now that we -- you can't trust 'em.  You can't believe what they say.  [MN]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sure.  Sure.
L:  They ru- -- they run two sets of books and you can't do that.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I think that the situation is improving now.  [LAUGH]
L:  You think it is improving?
R:  I -- I think so, yeah.  [SIGH]  Ah --
L:  I think we've got a long way to go on it though, they still need to [SIGH] -- to, ah, -- there's a lot more that needs to come to light that, ah, --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- that hasn't been.  [MN]  There's a  --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- there's a lot of corrections that need to be made I think.  [NOISE]
R:  So, ah, you -- you think, ah -- ah, the big corporations are still, ah, playing tricks with, ah, -- a- accountings or -- or other things.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, I definitely do.  I think they're running two sets of books.  [SIGH]  Whatever --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- it makes to -- to make them look good and all.  That's been -- been proven too much [SIGH] with your --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- [SIGH] Enron, your Worldcom.  And [SIGH] we had the Worldcom situation here in my area and so --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- [SIGH] I know what, ah, [SIGH] -- what a lot of people have suffered over that and when everything came to light that that was basically what they were doing.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  They were just juggling the figures to make it look good and [SIGH] -- and in the long run, ah, -- I mean if we did that they would be on us and we'd be in jail.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  If the little person did -- ah, did ... their accounting the way that the big corporations do [SIGH] you know good and well that we'd be in jail.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sure.  Sure.  Sure.  [SIGH]  But that's a little bit too much surprise because I think [SIGH] with all those high profile cases, ah, the -- the big corporations, ah, --ah -- ah -- are much more careful with, ah, -- with their accounting but I'll [NOISE] use that.  You [NOISE] don't think, ah, they are improving too much, right?  [LAUGH]
L:  Not at the present time I don't.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I think that a lot of 'em have gotten, [SIGH] ah, s- scared to where t- they're trying to cover their tracks more than they are trying to improve their --
R:  Okay.  Okay.
L:  -- [SIGH] their accountability.  [MN]
R:  I see.  I see.  [SIGH]  So, they are trying to +cover up what they have done.  [SIGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK]  I think they're covering their tracks.
R:  At least --
L:  Yes, they're going -- they're going back and trying to [SIGH] -- to m- make things look ... look correct, ah, because of --
R:  Okay.  [SIGH]
L:  -- of what they have been doing.   [MN] I still --
R:  Okay.  I --
L:  -- think there's a lot of improvement that needs to be done and I believe that [SIGH] there needs to be more accountability, as I said before.  [SIGH]  And that, ah, it's gonna take a long time for the trust to be built back up.
R:  But I think, ah, [SIGH] the time the same things [NOISE] -- ah, ah, ah, like, [NOISE] ah, ah, [SIGH] FCC [NOISE] already, ah, much hotter than -- than before.  [SIGH]  So, you don't think t- that alone is not, ah, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is not effective, right?  [SIGH]
L:  No, you need more than the -- than the FCC.  You're gonna have to cover [SIGH] a lot of different areas there because this isn't one -- just one little small thing.  [SIGH]  It -- I mean --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it covers a- a- all of the, ah, like, in Worldcom, [SIGH] it was all of your upper echelon that were in on it.  It wasn't just one person.  One person can't do it alone.  [SIGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  So, you're going to have to go into the departments and you're going to have to have the disclosure.  [SIGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  And we don't have the disclosure now.
R:  Okay.
L:  [MN]  And they--
R:  O- --
L:  -- they go in an, ah, -- it you know, -- it's so --
R:  Okay.  [SIGH]
L:  -- it's -- everything's kind of pushed underneath the carpet and tried to [SIGH] -- to hide to make the figures look good.  Ye- --
R:  I see.  So, I -- I see your point.  So, you think, ah, [SIGH] a systematic, ah, reform, ah, is necessary to curb the +whole thing, rather than some --
L:  There's got to be a dramatic reform.  Yes.  [SIGH]
R:  Okay.  Okay.
L:  Yes.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  And --
L:  And more accountability.  There's -- the -- the accountability that they've had n- now and more check -- like I said, checks and balances.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And, ah, we haven't had those.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  They -- they've d- done what they pleased when they pleased and how they pleased.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Yeah, I -- I see your point.
L:  And a lot of was politics.  I mean they'd buy a big politician, you know, they're you'd go so --
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] everybody turned their back and they could do what they want to.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  I mean [SIGH] e- everybody has to be held accountable is the way I look at it.
R:  Yeah, because ah, -- a [SIGH] [COUGH] +usually those people are in charge of the power so [SIGH] it -- it's very hard to -- to curb them.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well, it's a shame that money has so much control [SIGH] and --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- instead of, ah, people being honest and trying to -- I mean it -- it comes down to the dollar sign and I think that's very -- [SIGH] very sad that -- that money ... i- itself has that much control because it can buy and sell people.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Because I think, ah, you have more ... first hand experience of things.  You're in [SIGH] Texas.  [NOISE]  Well, in Cali- --
