R:  Hi.  This is Elizabeth in Seattle. [NOISE]
L:  And this is Sabrina from Seattle.
R:  Hi.  That's pretty cool.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Yep.
R:  Um, I guess our topic, ah -- I -- you know, I know so little about all that Enron and world stuff that, [NOISE] um -- [NOISE] I know it was a h- heavy impact on me but not directly.  Just the things that drove our economy into the ground and [NOISE] there's n- --
L:  Yeah.  No.  We're all suffering the effects of it.
R:  Huh?
L:  Yeah.  We're all suffering the effects of it.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Everyone is.  It's just -- and they're still not even b- -- prosecuting half those people.  Some of them still living in mansions and, you know -- [NOISE] it's just in- -- unbelievable to me how they could get away with that much money. [NOISE] And I think two people have been indicted or something. [NOISE]
L:  Only two?
R:  Two or three.  Yeah.  Not very many. [NOISE] No.  The rest of them are just, kinda, sitting back waiting. [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] I -- I -- you know, I read the paper constantly.  I'm -- I -- m- -- [NOISE] I'm a, um, obsessive compulsive about newspapers. [LAUGH] So, I read two --
L:  A- --
R:  -- of them every day.  And, ah, it just -- when it first came out I just couldn't believe it. [NOISE] Well, I could believe that people are that greedy [NOISE] but it's like the Martha Stewart thing, you know?  You would think they would have more sense. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- 'cause in the end, you're gonna get caught. [NOISE]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know?  They sh- -- they -- [NOISE] I'm sure every criminal knows in their mind, "I'll get away with this one" [NOISE] but [NOISE] there's always one.  They always get caught.  There's r- -- I don't know how many it -- just get away with it but I guess a lot.  Probably. [NOISE]
L:  Yep.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yep.
R:  It's --
L:  People don't -- people just don't realize that, you know, no matter what they do, somebody -- somebody's watching them or --
R:  Exactly.  Or -- or filming them or listening to them and --
L:  Yep.
R:  Yeah.  And it's -- it makes you real paranoid and -- but it's true. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Unfortunately.  Yeah.
L:  Yep.
R:  You know, I -- I'm not into stocks and bonds and all of that, like, Enron but, you know, I have two Microsoft stocks. [LAUGH] My sister gave me one, oh, two or three years ago and then it split into two. [NOISE] Then I have two, which, you know, [NOISE] pull in sixteen cents a month [LAUGH] or something. [LAUGH] I --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, you know, i- i- -- those people deal in billions of these things and just like they're nothing. [NOISE] And -- but -- and they -- and they create things that aren't even there, [NOISE] which I thought was, kind of, weird. [NOISE]
L:  Yup. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  E- everybody really knows that the stock market is nothing more than just organized gambling.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Exactly.  Yeah.  I never, you know -- I never knew anything about it when I was growing up.  No one taught [NOISE] -- you know, I wasn't taught that was an important part of my life and I should learn it.  I wish I had have. [NOISE] You know, I certainly would've liked to been able to know what I was talking about with that but, um, [NOISE] I -- I think it's j- -- like, you say, it's just all dishonest.  They're [NOISE] n- n- -- t- -- both hands don't know what the other one's doing. [NOISE]
L:  Yep.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yep.
R:  [NOISE] It's, um --
L:  What I -- ah, what I think is they should have, like, better regulations as --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- far as what people can do.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Like Marsha -- Martha Stewart should never have been allowed to sell that property [NOISE] or her bonds and stuff.  There should have been something there at the FCC so when they saw her selling all that many, [NOISE] that they would say, "Wait a minute, something's wrong here". [NOISE] Ah, you know, "Maybe we need to find out why she's selling 'em". [NOISE] And -- and -- and apparently, that's what d- -- what they did eventually, is they figured out how she knew and -- and that was illegal. [NOISE]
L:  Mm.
R:  [NOISE] But I don't know what kinda safeguards they could put on, like, [NOISE] you know, they -- they try do all that with b- bad checks and everything else and they still get through.  So, [NOISE] it's, um, [NOISE] -- it's c- --
L:  I think that people --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I think when an employee --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, buys into a stock plan with a company that they work for --
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't think they really have an active, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I think -- I don't think they really allow --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, they have --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like, reports or a way of controlling --
R:  M- --
L:  -- what goes on with their money.
R:  [NOISE] No.
L:  You know, a- -- is -- I think they're just, like, sheep, you know?
R:  Yep.  Yep.  It's -- it --
L:  Yup.
R:  You oughta take this piece of paper that means nothing now and probably will never [LAUGH] mean anything and -- but, you know, that's -- that's loyalty to the company and so I guess I, you know -- I -- it's just a miracle to me that -- things that people do. [NOISE] Although, I probably wouldn't have -- well, I don't know if I could've done it for the million dollars or not. [NOISE] [PAUSE] It's, um --
L:  Yeah.  I -- I -- I w- -- I would never buy into the stock for a company that I'm working for.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I'd -- I never do.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Never do.  Because I know things can go wrong.
R:  [NOISE] Right.  Well, I did that with my four oh one kay. [NOISE] And see, when I first heard of 401Ks, all I heard was, "You put in so much money, your company puts in so much money and at the end you have all this much money". [NOISE] And then -- and just when this -- all this Enron and stuff started, my stocks started falling [NOISE] so my four one kay kept getting smaller instead of getting bigger.  And my -- one of my girlfriends cashed out all of her mutual funds just in time 'cause I guess they crashed or something and -- [NOISE] but you don't know.  You just see this name of a piece of paper that they've invested your money and [NOISE] -- and they could all go belly up in a minute.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And we don't know. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know any of those names or what they or [NOISE] ...  That was for -- and I [NOISE] -- I got out and got my four oh one kay out as quickly [LAUGH] as I could. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But -- yeah.  It's -- when I turned fifty nine and a half they said, "You can have it" and I'm took it and I said, "I'm through".
L:  Yeah.
R:  I want the money but [NOISE] it -- you know, you just don't know.  You have to really be schooled in that and -- and go through the stock market stuff.  And --and the government should do -- there should be enough people in there n- -- m- -- god knows they have enough people watching us.  [LAUGH] They could sure have someone watching the big corporations.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I think the safest thing you can do --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I have a savings bond.  It's just, like, fifty dollars.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  My husband --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- got it for me back in, ah -- in, ah, February of two thousand and two.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, ah, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I haven't really gotten that much interest on it.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Maybe a couple of dollars or a few cents or something or whatever.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But, ah, I think bonds are really the safest way to invest your money.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  'Cause you have it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Y- -- it's your money.  A- -- the only thing would happen is if the government failed [NOISE] and then we'd all be in trouble anyway. [NOISE]
L:  Hm.
R:  [NOISE] But -- yeah.  I think bonds are a good way to go. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, [NOISE] I know that I'd -- it -- since [NOISE] -- it's been a while since December and the economy has really hit me the hardest and [NOISE] -- and I've just been a day by day trying to figure out how to just keep my head above the water and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I look -- think of all those people that, [NOISE] you know, they en- -- millions and billions of dollars and they didn't even go to jail. [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] And they didn't --
L:  A- and the impact that people have the -- I mean, that the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, the industries have on us as, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- consumers and as workers, they're already sending everything overseas.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Recently, I just found out --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that Microsoft is sending -- is outsourcing their call centers in India.
R:  [NOISE] I'll be damned.
L:  Some reason --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I was trying to set up my, ah, DSL but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I was having problems so I called Microsoft and they transferred me over, you know, to the -- to the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- tech support and then I had to call back subsequent times and every time the person that I talked to had an Indian accent.
R:  Huh.
L:  And then they told me they were being outsourced.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  They're outsourcing their call centers.
R:  [NOISE] Wow. [NOISE] Jeeze.
L:  First India, but other -- a few other countries too.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  The -- Bangladesh and all those p- pla- -- 'cause they pay them people thirteen cents an hour and that's a lot of money over there.  That's just wrong.  'Cause then there's people over here who are homeless because of that. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and jobless.
L:  Yes.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  It's [NOISE] ...  You know, I understand that they wanna make money but, um, [NOISE] well, they sure don't care how they make it.  It gets pretty cut throat to me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, with -- with the Enron thing that went down --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I think that everybody now is more aware of what could happen.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think people should just, like, talk to a really good financial advisor.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Find out --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, if they really didn't know anything about the situation, find out what went wrong and how they can avoid falling victim under the same thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause, you know, you only get into trouble if you're ignorant.
R:  Yep.
L:  Yep.
R:  Yep. [NOISE] H- --
L:  So, if everybody had knowledge in everything that they're getting into beforehand, they can make a very --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- informed decision instead of just running into something blind or warned by what somebody says.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  'Cause that's not really solid.  You need everything in writing.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Everything that's documented and proven to work.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's what people that work for Enron should have done.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, just because they work for a company for such a high amount of years, that doesn't mean, necessarily that the company's, you know, doing things in their best interest.
R:  [NOISE] No.  No. [NOISE] We get to thinking that.  After you work for the company for a long time you'd think they would be loyal to you but -- but you're replaceable. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Everybody is and they --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- ah, forget that stuff and --
L:  Yeah.  That's the only thing that sucks. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Really.
L:  Yeah.  Right now, what I'm trying to do is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I haven't had steady work since I was let go.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I was -- with the last job I had I was working for eBay back in, ah, Utah.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Where I transferred up here from.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And, ah [PAUSE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Since then, I've been homeless.
R:  Oh.
L:  I recently [inaudible] homeless back in April this year.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's tough, you know?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Very tough.  And --
R:  I, ah --
L:  So, I decided to do --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  In the near future, I'm trying to develop my own non profit corporation so I can help people that are low income.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Help them pay their bills and all that.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, that would be wonderful.  I've -- I'm -- I'm almost in that same situation.  I -- I have an eviction notice and, um, I go to court on the twelfth.  I got fired in December so I -- my rent is --
