R:  Hi.  My name is Monica.
L:  Hi Monica.  My name is Laurie.  I'm on a cellphone and I cannot hear really, really great and I could not even hear what the topic is about so can you tell me what it's about?
R:  It means, what is -- it's what does family mean to you?  Can you hear me okay if I talk this loud?
L:  Yes.  Y- yeah.
R:  Okay.  Great.
L:  I can hear you fine.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  Well, I guess what family means to me is, um, the people that I live with, which are my husband and my kids and my extended family and my close friends as well.
R:  Pretty much the same thing to me.  Um, when I think about family, first, I think of my mom, my grandparents, my son, my husband and then, you know, if you think about it further you're gonna include all your cousins and everybody.
L:  Do you -- do you have a lot of people that live with you or do you have, um, a very small family --
R:  Ah --
L:  -- there in your household?
R:  It's a s- -- pretty small family.  Just me, my husband and my fourteen year old son.  It's been us three for about a year.
L:  Mhm. [PAUSE] W- -- that's a --
R:  How about yourself?
L:  Ah, well, there's six of us.  I've got four kids.  I've got a sixteen, a fourteen, a twelve and a ten.
R:  Wow. [LAUGH]
L:  And so -- and, of course, with all of their friends that are over, they're like my kids too, so --
R:  Oh, yeah.  It's pretty busy isn't it?
L:  It is.  Very busy.  But, ah -- you know, I think family, also is -- is a -- a very few --handful of very close friends.
R:  That's true.  Yeah.  I agree with that also.
L:  At least, it seems to be that way in our family.  I've -- they're -- they're as close and even closer than some extended family that I just never see and get to do anything with.
R:  Yeah.  We have, um -- we have a couple of -- of members -- well, see that's the thing, we consider them family. They're -- they've known my mom since, ah, they were -- maybe, they met when they were five years old and now --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they're included in all the family gatherings and all of that and, you know, they're -- they're closer than some of our actual blood relatives to us.
L:  Right.  I think it -- it's really odd.  I was raised by my mother and my stepfather and my stepfather, he's my dad. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And my real father, we was -- he's more like a distant uncle.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Because I never -- I never really saw him.  I'd maybe get a card at Christmas and a call on my birthday and that was about it for a -- many years.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's -- it's so funny because I -- I live, probably, nine hundred miles from my mother now and my father will still give the excuse, "Well, I would've called but I was scared I might get your mother on the phone".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  What about, um, like, half brothers and sisters?  Do you have any of them from your father?
L:  Yes, I do.  I have a sister who is -- let's see?  I'm thirty five and she's twenty one.  She's just graduating from college.  And I've a brother who is a year older than my oldest son. [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.
L:  So, he's seventeen, almost eighteen.
R:  Uh-huh.  Are you close to them?  Do you talk to them at all?
L:  I talk to them a little more than I talk to my father but not very much.  They were -- I didn't see my dad when they -- very much when they were born.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I love 'em to pieces but I just never really have had the opportunity.  I mean, they were -- they're closer to the age of my children than an- any of my other siblings so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But my -- my mom and my step dad have a daughter together so she's my half sister and she's as mu- -- you know, I feel as close to her as I do my sister who's full blood.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So [LAUGH] --
R:  So --
L:  So --
R:  -- you also have a full blooded sister?
L:  Uh-huh.  I sure do.  And we're very, very close.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I'd say the three of us that grew up in the same household are probably --
R:  Yeah.  That's --
L:  -- the closest of all the kids.
R:  The same thing with me.  I have -- well, I have a -- no full brothers and sisters but from my dad, I have two brothers and a sister and from my mom, I have another half brother.  But it -- you know, if anybody will ever ask me, "How many brothers and sisters in your family?"  I'll just say one brother.  And I -- you know, and I'm -- I'm semi close with my -- with my dad's other children --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but I still -- we didn't grow up together so I don't really consider them my full brother and sister.  I don't mention them when somebody asks.
L:  Right.
R:  It's strange. [LAUGH]
L:  That -- that's so odd.  That's how I am with mine.  It's not that I don't consider 'em, it's just having not grown up with them they're -- I -- I guess I'm just not as close.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't -- it's not that I care any less but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  My sisters, I can just about know what they're gonna say before they even say it -- the ones that I grew up with.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And the others, it's -- it's much harder --
R:  Yeah. It's -- it --
L:  -- to have a clear picture of who they are.
R:  Yeah.  It's different.  I had, ah, my half brother -- my oldest half brother, he came to live with me last year for about six months and it was -- it was really awkward 'cause, you know, you don't know this person's habits and it's just different --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, than trying to --
L:  Even their values.
R:  Yeah.  Then -- then --
L:  You don't know.
R:  -- actually, my other -- my -- my brother from my mom, if he were to stay with me, it would've been, like, no big deal.  And this was, kind of, like a s- stranger yet you know him, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  It was really weird ha- having him there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Are you cl- -- do you live close by to your -- like, your mother and your grandparents?
R:  Yeah.  We live all in the same city within fifteen minutes of each other.  The only one who -- who doesn't live with us or near us is my dad.  He -- we live in El Paso, Texas, he lives in Los Angeles and, um --
L:  Oh, that's a good ways.
R:  Yeah.  We -- I get to see him about twice a year though.  He'll come down here, ah, stay about a week with me and then a lot of times, during the summer, I'll take my son up there and, ah, we'll go visit him.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I get to see him very often but not, you know -- it's not the same as, like, I can just pick up the phone and go visit my mom or my grandparents like I want to.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, that's hard with -- with family.  I've always lived in the same -- or within, you know, fifteen, twenty minutes of all of my family except for my dad.
R:  Yeah.
L:  He was about eight hours away.  But, um, after I got married, um, after a couple of years, we moved away so, my closest family is ... oh, gosh -- nine hundred miles. [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.  It is -- is that --
L:  So --
R:  -- like, weird for you?  Not having them around?
L:  It is.  And everybody else is close together so -- and I travel for work every week so I'm -- I -- I get to see 'em, fortunately.  I've been down, like, every other month so I get to go spend a couple of days with them.
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  So, it's really nice.  But then I show up and everybody else has been together.  They know what's been going on on a day to day basis and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've, kind of, been out in the cold and [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- haven't seen anybody.
R:  Do you get to talk on the --
L:  And they're all down in Austin.  They're down in Texas.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  That's where I'm from originally.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But I'm in Tennessee now.
R:  Wow.  Do you get to talk on the phone with them very often?
L:  It depends.  E- -- we'll go -- we'll talk a couple of times a week for several months and then we'll, kind of, get busy with things that are going on at home and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it might be a couple of months before we talk.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, it really depends on -- on just time of year and how busy everybody is at work.
R:  What do you do for your f- -- your family with -- during the holidays?  Do you try and visit your family in Austin or do --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you guys have your own celebration?
L:  Usually, we go down there.  It's a lot easier for just us --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- to go than --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for everybody else to come up here.
R:  Ah --
L:  I think they've come up, maybe, one time in the seventeen years I've been married. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, that's --
R:  Wow.
L:  That's -- that's not very often.
R:  So, for those seventeen years, you've been in Tennessee?
L:  No.  I've only been here for almost ten.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LIPSMACK] And before that I lived in Arkansas for about seven years so --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So, it's been a long time since I lived close by my family.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Which is --
R:  Now, when you go visit --
L:  -- really makes it hard.
R:  [LAUGH] When you go visit does -- do you find, like, there's only a certain amount of time you can spend with them before you're like, "I gotta get outta here and go back home"?
L:  I love it.  Now, everybody else -- I don't know.  They -- they love having me there but my husband gets -- he's ready to go.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  He doesn't -- it's not -- it's not the same for him.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't think he enjoys [LAUGH] it as much.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  He likes it in small doses. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's, kinda, how I -- I am.  I -- when I go visit my father in LA, it'll be, like, you know, after three days, like, the novelty, kinda, wears off and then by the fourth day you're, like, "Oh, I just wanna go home". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Anything longer than four or five days, you're just going crazy -- or I am anyways -- going crazy to --
L:  Mhm.  It's hard -- I think it's hard too when you're out of your own home.  I mean, it's -- I'm always more comfortable in my own environment.
R:  Mm.
L:  The rest of the time, if I'm tired, I'll still stay up because I feel I like I have to go out and visit.
R:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH] And it -- has your sixteen year old talked about leaving the home when he goes, you know -- graduates from high school?
L:  Uh-huh.  He'll be seventeen next year and one thing that's -- I think is really neat about family, he's -- he wants to go to college down in Texas where -- in Au- -- at UT where he can -- you know, that's where my whole family is so --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So, he'll have family to take care of him and keep an eye on him and help him when he's in, you know -- needs help.
R:  Oh, that'd be great.
L:  But he'll still get that feeling of I'm away from mom and dad.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  So, that's really comforting to me to know that he's got all that extended family down there to watch out for him.
R:  Oh, definitely.  Does he have any --
L:  I've thought about moving but if I move down there right now, he'd probably think, "No, I wanna go to college away from my parents". 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  So, I don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, that's neat.
L:  A- -- but, yeah.  My family is -- I don't know if it's different with girls than with -- with men, as far as families, but I think I'm much closer to my family than my husband is to his.
R:  Really?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I think --
L:  Very much so.
R:  -- for myself, it's just the opposite.  My --
