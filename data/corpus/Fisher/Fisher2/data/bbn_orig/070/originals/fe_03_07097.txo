L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello?  [SIGH]  This is --
L:  [NOISE]  Hello?
R:  -- hello, this is Ellen in Southern California.  [SIGH]
L:  Hi!  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Jeffrey in Mississippi, central Mississippi.
R:  Oh, well, we're [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we're quite far apart --
L:  [SIGH]  Yes.
R:  -- but perhaps we won't be so far apart on the topic we've been a- assigned.  [SIGH]  And, ah, [NOISE] I [MN] think I'm [SIGH] as disgusted as --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] everybody else in the country is with the [SIGH] s- scale of the scandals, [SIGH] ah, for big business --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and what the, ah, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- government is not going about it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- more than [SIGH] being --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- pleased with what the government is doing.  What do you think?  [SIGH]
L:  Um, hold on for a second I've got [inaudible] you said [SIGH] [inaudible] hear half of what you just said there.  Can you hear me all right there?  [NOISE]
R:  Not very well, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there seems to be sort of an echo there.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, how's -- is that any better?  [NOISE]
R:  Yes, that's better.
L:  Okay.  So, I'm sorry, what were you saying about the scandals.  You don't -- you don't think the government's done anything --
R:  Well I --
L:  -- to, um, ...
R:  -- I don't -- I think the government in the sense --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- by all their d- deregulation and the tax cuts --
L:  [MN]  [NOISE]
R:  -- and everything and, ah, [SIGH] are -- sort of, ah, gave big business [SIGH] and these large corporations the go ahead and [MN] when you keep feeding people lies it, ah -- [SIGH] ah, I -- I think then you, ah, encourage other people to [SIGH] act inappropriately and amorally and illegally.  [NOISE]
L:  Well, I don't -- I don't know because, like, I think that it's [NOISE] [SIGH] just because somebody's lies that is in a big position or has a big responsibility [NOISE] or something, I don't think that influences other people to lies.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  That's like saying that music or video games influences [NOISE] violence in the schools or whatever, you know.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  I don't -- I don't -- I don't really agree with -- [SIGH] with all that.  I -- I think that people are still independent and they make excuses and make [SIGH] --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- anything to make themselves blameless for their actions [SIGH] --
R:  [SIGH]  Well, they --
L:  -- anything they can use to justify it they'll use.  [SIGH]
R:  Well, that -- that's perfectly true but, p- perhaps I -- I what I really mean is the [SIGH] -- the climate, [SIGH] ah, where pie was in -- pie in the sky and -- and so on and everybody thought that they could just do everything, [LIPSMACK] ah, --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- led to this kind of, ah, [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- f- frenzy in the market place.  [SIGH]  But I -- I agree with you about the -- the -- the music and everything.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't think that that really has -- ah, you can't blame it on [SIGH] [LAUGH] musicians when a child does something wrong.  [SIGH]
L:  Right.  Well, then,-- well I mean -- and I also think that people lie just because they feel like they need to protect themselves [SIGH] from the public eye because the decisions they make, I think -- I mean I'm -- I'm [SIGH] -- I'm not trying to defend everybody that's ever m- made a -- like, done a scandal whatever but I think that [SIGH] to a certain degree that we don't know the whole story of what decisions they're faced with and what -- what their job exactly entails.  And [SIGH] -- and maybe it -- it was -- [NOISE] I think they may -- I mean, like, some people get in the positions just to have a position of higher standing or [SIGH] they get in that [NOISE] position, [SIGH] um, to make money but there are still some people that do, um, [LIPSMACK] they are in positions and the have to make tough decisions every day and, [SIGH] ah, when they -- when they feel like they are ... pressed with a hard decision, they make p- perhaps the wrong one and they get accused of it, [SIGH] you know.  And nobody else in America is faced with the decision that they ... [NOISE] m- made and, you know, just because it's the wrong one [SIGH] you know, they're raked [NOISE] over the coals for it and everything.  And I'm not saying there shouldn't be consequences that should be paid but [SIGH] it shouldn't of -- I don't think it should be ... blow- -- blown out of proportion and, [SIGH] um, j- just kind of, um, ... [NOISE] dissected as much as it is, you know?  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Well, I -- I think with -- with, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- ah, some people it's [MN] what the Greeks called, ah, hubris [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, ah, they got into --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- such a ... high position and were so overpaid, really, [LIPSMACK] and also -- so, um, [MN] burdened by [SIGH] all the requests of corporate ownership [SIGH] and everything and everybody has to do better, and better, and better, and better and I think --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- this led pe- -- you know, paint -- that they get painted into a corner [SIGH] where they feel --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- that they h- have to produce [MN]  and if they don't, ah, they'll be, um,  --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK] penalized in -- in some other way.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  But, I mean you take Martha Stewart now.  [LAUGH]  They're really after her.  [SIGH]  And, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but what she did was, um, over reaching just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean just for forty five thousand dollars and she's got millions, you know, -- it seems so --
L:  Yeah, that's true.  That's true.  A- --
R:  And so I -- I think a lot of people, ah, [MN] it -- it's like, you know, p- power corrupts and, ah, --
L:  Yes, --
R:  -- absolute power.
L:  -- power hungry.  Greed.  It's like a greed I think.
R:  Yes, I agree.  I -- I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- really think that -- that's behind it and people think [SIGH] -- they become very arrogant when they have that much power I think --
L:  Yep.  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, ah, [SIGH] also --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I -- I think you're right though --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- a lot of people are over -- not [LAUGH] only are they over compensated [LAUGH] but they over compensate --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- themselves.  T- they have, ah, [SIGH] -- they have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they may not have quite the confidence that they appear to have [SIGH] and so they have to d- do all these, ah, [SIGH] -- ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- very, ah, high adrenaline [LAUGH] things --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- to, [SIGH] ah, to ha- -- you know, to seem to be, ah, [SIGH] in absolute control.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But it doesn't do the country [SIGH] any --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- good probably [MN] --
L:  [NOISE]  [MN]
R:  -- in the long run.  [SIGH]  And --
L:  Yeah.  Do you --
R:  -- and, ah --
L:  -- do you think if this, like, um with the whole Martha Stewart situation, do you think i- if [SIGH] it would have been a different person or a smaller down sized, [SIGH] um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or just s- scandals in general, i- if the companies that are involved are smaller, [SIGH] like, if -- if it wasn't -- and, like, if -- if, um, somebody else lied on their job and it wasn't, um, the President of the United States that happened to lie do you think [SIGH] that, um, e- everybody would have -- would take it so seriously or make it such a big deal?
R:  [MN]  Ah, [SIGH] no I th- --
L:  Do you think a lot -- a lot of importance that is stressed is -- just depends on the person and their situation and their company and the prestige of the company etc, etc?
R:  Oh -- oh, th- that's true it is -- I mean each case is an individual case but t- then you look at it and there are so many of them --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I think that's what -- and people are also disturbed about +first -- first there's Enron [SIGH] but then it seems to, [SIGH] ah, [SIGH] be --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like a fungus, you know, and it -- it mushrooms in other ... c- companies as well.  [LIPSMACK]  And, ah, a lot of firms I -- I think, ah, [SIGH] a- ah, just, um, [LIPSMACK] tried to hard [SIGH] not ... to disappoint any of the investors.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And because -- and t- they also thought that because of government deregulation they could kind of skip around, ah, r- rules and regs [SIGH] and -- and do what they please --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and not get caught.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And, ah --
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  -- so, it's ah, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it -- it's just not a very good climate but there are hundreds and thousands of businesses that are perfectly honest and --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- and where people really try to -- to do the right thing.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, ah, [SIGH] -- so, ah, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but you know how it is there are always some rotten apples in a barrel.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, I -- I agree --
R:  And, ah --
L:  -- I agree.  [SIGH]  And those --
R:  And I do --
L:  I'm sorry what --
R:  I'm sorry -- no, go ahead.
L:  I was just gonna say and those -- those rotten apples is what ruins it for everybody else, you know?  [SIGH]
R:  [MN]  That's true.  That's --
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  -- true and, ah, --
L:  But what were you going to say?  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  I -- I was going to say that I think some of these c- companies --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- are [LIPSMACK] -- are really t- too big.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  They've become unwieldy --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and no one really can -- can --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- ah, [SIGH] head a big corporation like that and [SIGH] have his finger on -- [SIGH] on every, ah, [MN] every button, you know?
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  And so I think a lot of them then kind of pretend to know more than they k- know [LAUGH] and they really get in deep water.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Y- yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I can see that happening too.  Uh-hum.
R:  And, ah, and then also I think a lot of people, um, [LIPSMACK] ah, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- r- relegate a- authority to o- other people who may not be very competent.  [SIGH]  And, ah, but you know the [SIGH] -- a- as Harry Truman said, "The buck stops here".  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, the -- the heads of the corporations have to, ah, [MN] to do something.  [SIGH]
L:  You think the interview process for whatever corporation it is should be a whole lot more stricter [SIGH] or more thorough than it is, so we wouldn't hire [SIGH] or put people in positions that don't know what they're doing or w- what they're talking about or whatever?  [NOISE]
R:  I think it would --
L:  You think that would --
R:  -- be better.
L:  -- you think that would cut down on the scandals [NOISE] --
R: [SIGH]
L:  -- and the wrongings and the lies and everything?  [NOISE]
R:  Well I think -- in the first place I think these people are over -- over compensated.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I think they're paid way too much in these --
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
R:  -- huge corporations.
L:  So, you think there should just be an even distribution of wealth m- more than personally?
R:  Yes, I think so and I -- I really think --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that, you know, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- i- i- i- -- how much money can a person use anyhow?  But they use the m- money as -- as a power --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- symbol [SIGH] saying, "I make more, therefore, I'm better".  [SIGH]  It's not that you need more money or that, ah, t- the job requires [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, you know, that much of an outlay and so on --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I m- m- mean those  -- you know, millions of dollars for ... f- frivolous things like --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- you know, thirty thousand --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- dollars for a wastebasket and so on.  I mean that's ... j- just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- nobody needs to live like that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that's, [SIGH] ah, anybody who does that obviously --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- has lost [SIGH] all sense of proportion.  [MN]  But I think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think it's partly the public too, fe- -- and -- and the greed, ah, [SIGH] expecting the stock market to -- to go sky high and you find a lot of people investing who really have no business investing.  [LIPSMACK]  And so ... when the stock market, ah, went --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- down and people said, [MN] "What -- what happened?" you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- "Where's my money?"  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  And they --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- e- ever -- you know, you -- you just don't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- get a free ride in this life.  And, ah ...
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  And I -- I think --
L:  [NOISE]  [MN]
R:  -- people some times have, um, you know, they have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- great expectations on and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, we're being naive in many wa- --
