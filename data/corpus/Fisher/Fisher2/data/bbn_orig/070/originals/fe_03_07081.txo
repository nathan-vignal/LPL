R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.  This is Debbie in Ohio.
L:  Hi.  My name is Stephanie.  I'm in Philadelphia.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, right. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Have you done this before?
L:  I did it once before.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Me too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Me too.  This is my second time. [NOISE] So, okay.  What does family mean to you?  Ten minutes, huh? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Woo.  Okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Ah ...
R:  Are you married?
L:  No.  It's interest- -- yeah.  Um, I think, 'cause I'm single and, um, other than, you know, the family I grew up with, I -- I guess it -- I think about it as the people, you know, that you love and who -- that you support and that they support you.  You know, a lot -- and some of those are relatives and others are friends I guess.
R:  Mm.
L:  I don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, th- -- you're thinking the extended family too.
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  A- at -- well, I -- I have, um -- my immediate family is, um, three children and -- and then my husband and I are gonna celebrate our twentieth anniversary [LAUGH] this year. [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.  Congratulations.
R:  Yeah.  Thank you.  So, um -- but I agree with you.  Family, um, can extend further than --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- than what you think of as just your immediate family.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- but boy, I sure -- I'm sure pressed to think a- -- how we're gonna talk about it [LAUGH] for ten minutes. [LAUGH]
L:  I know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's so different.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Like, I just --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know --
R:  I f- -- I f- --
L:  I d- -- I don't have any kids or ...
R:  Y- yeah.  The first --
L:  You know?
R:  -- topic I thought, "Oh, yay" you know and we can get it all in in time and --
L:  Sure.
R:  That's --
L:  But this is a --
R:  This is, like --
L:  -- big and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- personal thing.
R:  [LAUGH] Ah ...  Well ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.  Well, so you are single?  Y- -- is --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there anybo- -- any prospects there for ...?
L:  No.  That's the -- that's why it's, kinda, like, well, okay.  So, if I -- if it just turns out that I, you know -- I'm just not the marrying kind, like, what kind of family, you know -- what I have other than -- like, I have a brother --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah, you know, and parents that are s- -- you know?
R:  Is your brother married?
L:  He is married and I have, ah, two nephews.  Yeah.
R:  Well, there you go.  That's part of your family.
L:  Yeah.  You know, they --
R:  But --
L:  -- live -- I don't live very close to them so I see them, you know, like on holidays.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But as the daily -- I don't really have, sort of, like a daily family life thing.  It's more like --
R:  Well --
L:  -- friends and stuff.
R:  Yeah.  I think -- I think too sometimes women who don't have children or can't have children --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- sometimes wind up being more m- -- ah, motherly than -- than some moms who do have --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- physical kids, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, my dad d- -- ah, um, was a pastor and he -- every Mother's Day he would talk about his aunt who, um, was just so wonderful to --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the different kids in the community and she couldn't -- she -- she didn't have any other children.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  So, it -- it's -- in that sense, I -- I think, um, family has a little broader meaning.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then for me too, I think of my, ah, church family.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, you know, people that -- that I'm around a lot and, like you said, that support you and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- are there when -- when, um, the bad times and good times come.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So -- so, well, you -- you don't sound very old.  Are you twenties?  Thirties?
L:  Th- -- I'm in my thirties.
R:  Are ya?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And you've never been married.
L:  No.
R:  M- -- ah, yeah --
L:  No.
R:  -- maybe you're not supposed to be then.  Or then --
L:  Yeah.  I don't know.
R:  -- maybe you're --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- just a late bloomer. [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know.  I used -- like, I was more worried about it when I was younger.  Now, I'm, kinda like, "Well, okay" you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  If some- -- you know, I don't wanna gr- -- jump into it or -- you know?
R:  Well, and then there's -- there's people who've married two or three times v- -- by --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- by the time they're thirty.  You know, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'd -- I'd rather not be married than to marry and get a dippo.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  You know? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  That's a --
R:  So --
L:  I -- and it's strange 'cause I think, "Oh, wow" you know?  I still, sort of, think of myself as young but I have friends my age who are now m- -- you know, they're remarried.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they marr- -- you know, they ...  And, um --
R:  Oh, I think there's -- there's a lot -- it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It seems to be a lot more common to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- be getting married later and then people having their first babies --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- you know, in their thirties and even forty now.  So --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think it's -- it -- people are waiting longer.
L:  Yeah.  Things that --
R:  This period, you know?
L:  Yeah.  I think also, like, um -- like, my parents got married right -- like, right out of college and then, you know -- and then I think it just took less money to get started or [LAUGH] something --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- like that, you know?  Now, it's -- it's --
R:  Well, do you know what I think though?  Ah, honestly, I think --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that they didn't n- necessarily need as much.
L:  Yeah.  They might not have --
R:  Yeah.  I --
L:  -- had to get everything all set up.  Like, I'd --
R:  Right.  I think people today think that they have to have all their ducks in a row.
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  Um, but even then, there's things that can come up that you weren't planning on.
L:  Sure.  You never know.  Yeah.  Like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, my brother, when he was -- like, he did everything in order.  Like, you know, he got engaged, they got married, they looked for, like, just the right house and then they waited, you know, and -- and so everything was all -- it worked out fine but I don't -- I guess --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it w- -- you know, everybody doesn't do it like that.
R:  N- no.
L:  Yeah.
R:  No.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- and I think of, um, you know, i- in the Bible too that -- when God talks about that not everybody is -- should be married.  I think there's some --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- people that are married that probably shouldn't be. [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, I think so too because --
R:  As -- as proven by the divorce rate and so --
L:  Yeah.  I think people --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- people don't go into it thinking ab- -- I'm not sure what some people are thinking when they get married.  Ah, unfortunately, a friend of mine, um, who recently divorced, her ex husband revealed the idea that, ah, when he said, "I do" or whatever, he didn't think it was permanent or something.  And it's, kind of like, "Well, what did you was going on there?"
R:  What -- yeah.  What were you thinking? [LAUGH]
L:  "Did you think it was, kind of, a [MN] -- they were speaking figuratively or something when --" you know?  I don't know.
R:  Yeah.  Yes.
L:  All kinds of wacky things there -- I guess people think that -- I don't know.  I have no idea.
R:  It's not a big deal.  It's almost, like, a date.  You know --
L:  Yeah.  It's like an ex- --
R:  -- "Well, if this doesn't work out we'll just go to Plan B here and ..."
L:  Yeah.  I- -- that -- yeah.  I don't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  That just --
R:  So --
L:  -- seems strange.
R:  Sounds like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It sounds like if it's -- if it's meant to happen in your life, it better be somebody that's ready to make it permanent.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And -- and work through problems --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- and things like that.  Yeah.  It's --
R:  Well, and that's g- -- half the fun too sometimes.  Well, it's not fun. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I suppose so.  I don't know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Sometimes, I --
R:  Well, what --
L:  Yeah.
R:  What do you, um -- do you have a career?  Are you going to school or ...?
L:  Well, I work at a university and it's, you know -- it's more a just, sort of, a job kind of a thing than a, like, "Oh, this is --"
R:  This is what I want to the rest of my life? [LAUGH]
L:  -- my calling life" or whatever.  Yeah.  You know?  Um, but it's -- it's -- it's all right.  I think -- well, an- another issue is, like, I used to think that my job would just be -- like, I was just gonna be a total career person and --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- maybe not e- -- not necessarily have, like, a -- a family but --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- um, no, I don't think that's a good idea either. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Now, I'm like, "No".
R:  N- --
L:  'Cause, you know, jobs aren't that ...  I mean, j- -- you know, it -- some jobs are just great and you can be really excited about 'em but I think -- I don't know.
R:  A job's a job's a job, huh? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Kind of, ah, n- -- d- -- you know, every job, kinda, gets, you know, boring.
R:  Yeah.  Everything can get -- get old.
L:  Every s- -- every so often, you know -- I don't know.
R:  Yeah.  N- -- yeah.  I agree with ya and -- and e- even sometimes being a mom, as much as I love it, can --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- get old sometimes. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I can --
R:  I think --
L:  -- imagine with the --
R:  -- variety is the spice of life.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's what my dad always said. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.  So, do you -- do you also have a -- like, a -- a job outside of the home or do you --
R:  Um, no.  Actually, I have, um -- I do little things from -- I have a little home office.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, I do little, ah, independent contractor --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- jobs and, ah, I do those, kind of, independently whenever I have the time.
L:  Sure.
R:  But really, the kids -- ah, I -- I --
L:  Well, three is --
R:  -- came to a point where --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, I w- -- I came to a crossroads, basically.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I almost lost my son when I was carrying him.
L:  Oh, gosh.
R:  And it was because I had such a stressful job and it was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- almost like God was saying, "Okay" you know, "Which way are we gonna go here 'cause it's -- you're gonna be a --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- push, push, push -- you're gonna lose this little guy" and --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I -- I pulled out thinking, "Well, you know, I'll just -- this'll be for a while and then we'll see what happens".
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, the longer I was with him, the more I felt, "This is what I'm supposed to be doing".  So --
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I -- I -- for our family, it's definitely, um, b- been a blessing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- and we can afford it too.  I mean, I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  We don't need my income to pay for the necessities.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  Well --
R:  So, I had to -- I had to let go of my, ah, dreams of European --
