R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  My name is Renee.
L:  I'm Patty.
R:  I'm from Delaware.
L:  You're from Delaware?
R:  Yes.
L:  Ah, right now I'm in Philadelphia.  I'm from Utah but I'm staying in Philadelphia for the summer.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I'm not too far away from where you are.
R:  No.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, not at all. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And I guess the topic is family and I almost didn't hear all of what she said right then.  Was it --
R:  What does family mean to you?  I think that's -- that's what she said.
L:  What does family mean to you?  Well, maybe you could go first. [LAUGH]
R:  Maybe I [LAUGH] could go first?  I was just visiting my family for five days. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I guess I -- I feel that that's the -- very important and I like to keep them close and see 'em as much as I can.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  And keep them involved in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- my -- what I'm doing and keep involved in their lives.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Just think it's a nice to have, you know -- well, my family's really close and we have a --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- nice strong bond.
L:  When you say family, who's your, um -- who's your family?  Ah, y- you mean --
R:  No.  What else[?] --
L:  -- like your kids or your, um --
R:  Well, my family -- well, I have a h- --
L:  -- extended family?
R:  Well, I'm -- my -- my parents and my sisters and brothers --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and then also my -- my -- my two kids and my husband.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  And so, they -- you went to visit 'em all?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Except -- oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.  I just -- it's just about two hours to Maryland.
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
R:  So, that was a nice trip.
L:  Oh, that's not bad.
R:  No, it's not bad at all.
L:  That's really good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that's ac- actually not too far away.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Well, I'm actually here staying with my daughter and son in law and grandson for the summer so that I could spend time with them because we live so far away. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm -- you know, I feel the same way.  My mother in law -- I -- my husband was just visiting my m- -- my mother in law in Florida while [LAUGH] I was visiting my mom.
L:  Wow.
R:  She was moving so he was just helping her move.
L:  Oh, really?  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, that was neat.
L:  So, you know, to me -- I don't know.  Family encompasses a lot.  It's, you know, not -- there's a nuclear family and then, you know, you, kinda, go out from there and -- and we have people who are friends that are almost family, um, also.
R:  Yeah.  I agree.
L:  You know?
R:  I have -- I have some people I consider family. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  They're -- th- they're not --
R:  My kids call uncle.
L:  -- related but they still --
R:  Uncle and aunt. [LAUGH] They're not r- -- blood related.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right.  They still seem like family.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  I don't --
R:  Just being around -- yeah.  Just being around them makes you feel good. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R: [NOISE] 
L:  I -- I -- not that they always -- I mean --
R:  Well, I know not --
L:  -- not all family things are [LAUGH] --
R:  Well, not always.  Yeah.  I know but -- yeah.
L:  Sometimes, you can have the black sheep in the family --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and that's, ah, one that doesn't make you feel so good. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, I d- -- I'm just having a little bit of a problem lately with, ah, the family thing where they -- you know, it seems like they're broadening the definition to the point where any -- you know, it's -- I'm a nurse and --
R:  Mhm.  Oh, so am I.
L:  -- one of the -- oh, are you?
R:  What kinda nurse?  Yes.
L:  Well, you know, how McCaffrey has her pain scale and her --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- pain thing and pain is whatever the patient says it is?
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  And sometimes it's so frustrating because you take care of people who are real drug seekers and you walk in and they tell you their pain is a ten but they're chatting on the phone and they're, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- everything is --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- fine and th- their pain never comes down from a ten --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- even though they're getting huge amounts of IV awarded. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  And it -- you know, you just -- it's just frustrating.  And in the same way, I kind of feel like with the -- lately, it's, kinda, like that's what people want to relegate family to.
R:  Yeah.  They're blurring.
L:  It's kinda --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like family is anything you want [LAUGH] it to be.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And I do agree that, you know -- I mean, you can consider people your -- part of your family who aren't related to you and they can be as close as your family but I think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- especially for legal things, that I think that they're blurring those lines, you know, incredibly. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I -- I agree with you.
L:  And I don't think just because whoever you say is your family --
R:  That's why we have -- we have certain --
L:  I mean, then it's gonna change --
R:  Right.
L:  -- every week or two or month --
R:  Well, that's like I w- -- right.
L:  You know?  You break up with a boyfriend then and -- then, "Oh, well, now he's not my family". [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.  Right.
L:  You know?  Or she [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.  That's like I -- even with the -- yeah.  You're at the hospital, our visiting hours for family members only, "Well, I'm family.  I've known her since a- -- she was ten years old".
L:  Right.
R:  Well, [LAUGH] "You're not a blood relative.  Goodbye". [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Right.  Everybody can't be family.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I think that, sometimes, that's what they're trying to make it is all inclusive.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I think --
R:  Oh, they don't wanna anybody to b- -- feel hurt.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I, you know --
R:  [inaudible] to hurt [inaudible].
L:  And watch out for the special interest groups --
R:  They're --
L:  -- 'cause they have a lotta money.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, yes. There you go.
L:  And [LAUGH] --
R:  I was just gonna say that. [LAUGH] 
L:  And [LAUGH] -- and so, they won't y- --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  If they wanna m- -- you know, consider family this way, well, you know, then we all have to consider it that way and I just can't quite walk that line. [LAUGH] So -- but, you know, other than that I just -- I d- -- agree.  I, um -- right now, my husband's in school in Chicago and so I've been doing some travel nursing.
R:  Oh, wow.  Okay.
L:  And just trying to be with my different -- I said, "Well, I can sit at home alone with the dog and I, y- you know -- or I could -- I could go to Chicago for three years while he's doing his doctorate".  But I -- I didn't really wanna be in Chicago for three years and I thought, you know, "This is a great opportunity to spend time with family and go to different places and be with, you know ... "  So, first I went out to my elderly moms and my daughter's, like, within an hour so I, kinda, shared my time back and forth with them in Arizona and -- and now I've come here.  You know?
R:  Oh, wow.  So, you getting the -- you're in the --
L:  So --
R:  -- be able to be a nurse and visit at the same time.
L:  Right.  And so I'm being with family and, you know -- and -- and so, hopefully, next time I'll -- I'll go spend some time in Chicago.  My husband's there and wants to know when am I coming out there for a long time. [LAUGH] 'Cause I've been a long time -- I was a long time in Arizona.  Well, about three and a half months.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I'll be here about three and a half months so --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So --
R:  What kind -- what kind --
L:  You know?
R:  -- of nurse are you?
L:  Um, I do f- -- Medsearch.
R:  Medsearch?
L:  M- mostly post surgical.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And so, you know, there's a shortage right now so [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  -- it works to my benefit. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, it does.  You can, probably, pretty much tell them what you want.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I don't know it's so -- but it's been really nice, you know, to -- to be able to do that because, ah, otherwise our kids are spread a- -- you know, our youngest is in college and -- and, ah -- in Seattle.
R:  Oh, my goodness. [LAUGH] 
L:  And, you know, oldest is in Arizona.  And the middle child, with the first grandbaby, is out here in Philly. [LAUGH]
R:  Jeeze.  You're not kidding you're spread out.
L:  No.  And then my husband's in Chicago. [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.
L:  So, um, that's the only way.  You know, it's kind of, ah, f- -- I think family's very important and it's -- it's really nice to be able to be with them and, you know, spend some good quality time.
R:  Oh, yeah.  You're gonna have some good quality time there if you're there all summer. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's great.
L:  Yeah.  You know, and my daughter's in, um -- works at home and -- and -- on the computer and so, you know, if the baby's, like, into everything then --
R:  Mhm.  How old's the baby?
L:  -- it's really nice if I can help. [LAUGH] 
R:  It -- oh, it's enough to --
L:  Um, he's a year.
R:  Okay.  So, it's enough to get into stuff.  Okay.
L:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH] Just taken his first steps.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, yeah.  He's a doll.
R:  That's a great time.
L:  Yeah.  It is.  It's -- it's wonderful and I wouldn't miss it for everything.  It's where I think family's worth, you know -- putting yourself out for family or doing things and adjusting for -- on their -- for their benefit is --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, worth more than money --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.
L:  -- ever could be.  So ... [LIPSMACK] Yeah.  Well, and you w- -- and you went out -- or you're going out?
R:  No.  W- we just got back.
L:  You just got back?
R:  Yeah.  Actually today.
L:  And how long were you gone?
R:  Yeah.  We were just there for a couple --
L:  Yeah.  How long -- how long did you get to stay?
R:  Um, five days.
L:  Oh.
R:  I left Friday and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- came back today.
L:  Yeah.  And if it's only a couple of hours then you can do it fairly often.
R:  Yeah.  Which is good.
L:  Nice.  Except for work. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I -- I just -- I work pre DM so I don't have --
L:  Oh, do you?
R:  I don't work that much.  Yeah.
L:  Oh, that's nice.  Yeah.
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I tell them when I want to work. [LAUGH]
L:  That's wonderful.  Yeah.
R:  Which is another nice thing. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  That's -- I'm pre DM back in Salt Lake now.
R:  Oh. [SIGH] 
L:  B- -- while I'm, ah, doing all this gallivanting. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Hopefully, they'll save me a spot 'cause that's where we have a house.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  We've got a house in Utah.  So, ah, we'll eventually be back there I suppose but um ...  Yeah.  How -- and, you know, I think f- -- when you think about family too it -- there's a lotta responsibility there and especially when your parents get elderly.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They really -- you know, it's really a hard time.  I was telling my son in law today that I had to tell a -- a son that I didn't think his dad was gonna make it.
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  You know, I said, "It's not looking good for the home team here" you know?
R:  Mm.
L:  And he's DNR otherwise he'd be in ICU.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, yeah, 'cause he's doing, you know, all this really, you know, ICU kind of stuff --
R:  Mhm.
L:  With the right eye --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the eyes shifting to the right and the decorticate and --
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  -- you know, the whole bit.  And -- and it's really weird breathing I've never heard before. [LAUGH] Uh, you know, on a -- usually, we don't see this kind of thing an- and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah, you know, but it's -- it's just so hard.  I thought, you know, when your family gets older it's a tough thing to try and deal with all of their, you know, things that are going on with them.
R:  Right.
L:  So, that's part of the reason I went out to Arizona first was because my mom isn't -- tr- -- she's turning ninety this, ah, week.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  And she lives alone, you know?
R:  Wow.
L:  My sister that took care of her d- -- um, had cancer and died last year.
R:  [MN] Oh, my gosh.  I'm so sorry. 
L:  And so, yeah.  It was really hard because she was, like, my mom's best friend and confidant.
R:  Oh.
L:  And they lived together for, oh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, probably twenty five years.
R:  Mm.
L:  And, um -- and did everything together and so, you know, it's been really so hard on her and -- and I just think that, you know, there's a lot of responsibilities there that, m- -- you know, my oldest -- ah, the oldest sister in the family and -- and me, the baby, are trying to take on and -- and, you know, but we feel like that's a part of, you know, family --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is responsibility.
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  And, um -- and it's not easy.  Especially if you're s- --
