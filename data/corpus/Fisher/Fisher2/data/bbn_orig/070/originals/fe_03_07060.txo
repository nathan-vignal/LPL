L:  [NOISE] Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  How are you? [NOISE]
R:  Good.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  M- my name's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Samantha.
L:  Oh, I'm Danielle. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Ah --
L:  May as well -- but the topic is ... what is it?
R:  What is --
L:  The importance of family?
R:  What does family mean to you?
L:  Oh, what does family mean to me.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Ah, to me, family is pretty new to me 'cause, ah, I -- I have three kids and my husband and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- this is my family because, you know, growing up I just didn't have a great family, like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we -- they weren't loving.  They -- they never really were there for me.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Never, [NOISE] you know, encouraged me.  Never did the things that I do for my kids so --
R:  No.
L:  -- for me, you know, I have my family now.
R:  Right.  Wow.
L:  And, you know, they may disagree -- my family.  They think they did nothing wrong.  They think they, you know, did what they were supposed to but it's --
R:  That's --
L:  -- interesting that -- this is the topic 'cause --
R:  -- the idea of family -- yeah.
L:  Because I'm going through a whole thing with my family now where, basically, I just told my mom a couple of weeks ago everything that she did wrong --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- for me growing up and she denied everything and, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  They say I'm making things up but what it is is they're --
R:  They don't want to hear it.
L:  What they remember -- yeah, what they remember --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- isn't what happened. [LAUGH]
R:  I've had this --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- almost same conversation with a friend --
L:  Really?
R:  -- before.  Yes.
L:  [NOISE] M- --
R:  About how --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- people, like, see what's easiest for them to see.
L:  Right.
R:  And that, you know, people will say, like, "Oh, every family has their problems" and they do but it's -- it's a continual.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Like --
L:  Definitely.  You -- you have kids and ...
R:  No.  Not yet.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But, um, it's funny because, um, I'm getting married in August.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  So -- yeah.
L:  Congratulations.
R:  So, it's -- thank you. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, it's the whole idea of, like, your family being extended to other people.
L:  Right.
R:  And I've known them for a while but, like, a situation just came up where I might be living with, um, [LIPSMACK] ah, my fiancee's, like, in laws.
L:  Oh.
R:  And I'm --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I'm a student --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I mean, I'm a student so for six months I have to do an internship.  But I know them and I've known them for years but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they might charge me an extra hundred dollars to move in and it's --
L:  Really?
R:  -- been -- thank you.  It's been this entire, like, d- -- thing on my mind the past week, like, am I family?  Because, to me, family doesn't do that.  Like --
L:  Do they make him pay?
R:  Yeah.  But he's -- I mean, he's older.  He's even a little bit older than they are so -- and they just bought a new house so, fine.  To me, that's acceptable but I'm a student.  I make no money.  Like, the idea --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- of, like, ah, paying, like, that doesn't -- to me, family is you give without --
L:  Of course.  And --
R:  -- you know, asking for something in return.
L:  And they should be trying to help you guys out and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, not make you pay anything 'cause they know you're -- just starting out, you're gonna be struggling.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They should be m- -- you know, if -- if I was his mom -- I mean, I don't know how his mom is but I would say, you know, m- -- "Our gift to you is, don't worry about anything while you're here".
R:  Yeah.
L:  "Just save your money" and --
R:  He'll -- his parents -- his -- I -- I d- -- I should've clarified.  His parents would do that -- it's his brother and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and new wife.  So, I mean, I guess for them their, you know -- their -- think that their economic situation isn't great but it's, like, a million times better than mine 'cause I don't have a paycheck so --
L:  Right.  You don't work at all?  You just go to school?
R:  I -- I do.  I work, like, eight -- eight hour -- and, like, for, you know, four hours a week.  Like, I'm in a --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- really intensive grad program.
L:  That's nothing.  Yeah.
R:  Like -- yeah.  So, I'm, like, "I got no money". 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um -- so, this whole, like, family thing has been in my head because I'm, like, "Well, if my sister was in graduate school and she, like, needs a place to live" like, it wouldn't -- I'd just -- she'd come in.  Like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that's -- that's family.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  Definitely.
R:  It's, like, the support -- it's, like, it -- I don't know.  It's just, like, you know, no matter w- --
L:  Are they good to you though?  Like, his parents?  Do you feel like --
R:  Oh, yeah.  They're great.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're really good.  It's just -- it's just the idea of, like, merging, like, the way that you do things --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- with the way that his s- side of the family does things.
L:  Right.
R:  And, like, just figuring out, like, you know, what different things mean to you.  Like, you know, what's your idea of the -- your idea of, like, you know, say, like, a -- a wedding might be very different than their idea of a wedding.  And just, like, figuring that out.  So --
L:  Are you -- are you moving in before you get married with the family or after?
R:  Um, af- -- ah, after.
L:  After?
R:  After.  So, I have --
L:  And you think it's just gonna be a couple of months, kind of, thing?
R:  Yeah.  It's only, like, six months and then I'm, like, "We need to get our own place".
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause then I wanna start my whole -- like you were saying, like --
L:  Yeah.  Your family.
R:  Your family.  My family.
L:  Right.  Your family.  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you agree, like, if -- when you -- when you guys have kids, your family would be an extended [NOISE] part of you and your husband's family?  Like, you and your husband and your kids, that's your family.  Do you agree that then your mother and father and brothers and everything would then be an extended part of your family?
R:  Um --
L:  Or do you -- do you -- 'cause that -- that's what I'm trying to get through to my mom.  Like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they're an extended part of my family now.  You know?
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] This family --
R:  W- --
L:  [NOISE] -- comes first to me.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, they're -- they're everything to me not, ah -- I -- I don't see my parents --
R:  As --
L:  -- you know, like that any more.  They -- they don't do for me now.  My husband does for me, you know?
R:  Husband is -- yeah.  I see what you're saying.  Like -- yeah.  Because e- even with, like, holidays and stuff.  Like, currently, you know --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- he and I are still -- are still, like, engaged so we go to, like, our parents but I think, soon enough, like, we'll just start doing our own thing.  I mean, I think I still wanna see my mom and stuff, like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- on holidays.
L:  Right.
R:  But I think -- yeah.  Like, they're, sort of, a -- a -- a shift in what --
L:  Wait and see you have kids and then they're fighting about whose house are you gonna go to on Christmas.
R:  Yeah.  I know.  I know.
L:  And Thanksgiving, you know?  And it's, like, you can't make everyone happy.
R:  No.
L:  You wanna do your -- oh, my thing was Mother's Day.  My mother [NOISE]  doesn't wanna recognize that I have three kids.  She [NOISE] wants me to spend Mother's [NOISE] Day with her. [NOISE]
R:  Oh.
L:  But yet I'm, like, "I'm a grown woman.  I'm twenty seven. [NOISE] I have my own [NOISE] --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- three kids.  Don't you r- recognize that I wanna spend Mother's Day the way I want -- wanted to?"
R:  Yeah.  You're a mom.  Like, I mean --
L:  And she's, like, "But you're my daughter.  You should be with me".  And I'm, like, "I understand that but, ah -- this is -- you had [NOISE] how many years with me?"
R:  Y- -- right.
L:  You know?  I'll --
R:  And now you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's your turn.
L:  It's --
R:  It's your turn.
L:  It's -- it's crazy because m- -- they think that, you know, yeah, y- -- they're our moms but they can't rule us after we --
R:  No.
L:  -- have kids and -- and a husband.  That's -- you know, we have our own family now.
R:  A phone call should be just as good.  Like --
L:  Y- -- right.  Right.
R:  Ah, you know, it's -- it's -- it's the thought that counts I think.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Hi.
R:  It's hard.
L:  How old are you?
R:  I'm twenty five.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  You're -- you're --
R:  Ah --
L:  -- gonna see as --
R:  I know.
L:  -- soon as you get married --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and have kids, it changes.
R:  I know.
L:  It changes.
R:  I know.
L:  Because y- -- are you -- do you live close to your mom and -- and his mom?
R:  It's -- right now, I'm living with my mom 'cause --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- I'm poor and I'm in [LAUGH] school.  But, um, his parents are about three hours away.
L:  Mm.  Okay.
R:  So, we're -- you know, we're hoping to, kind of, be in between but it's hard to --
L:  And you're still gonna be in school once you live with him?
R:  Um, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I still have, like, another year to go.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Which is hard too because, like, I hate being dependent on people and it's, like, that, sort of -- you know, with the whole family thing, like, I'm gonna b- -- I'm okay -- I'm okay with being dependent on my fiancee but, like, it's still hard for me.  I'm living with my mom -- I'm, kinda, dependent on her and it's, sort of like, after I get married, like, he'll, I guess, take care of everything.
L:  Right.
R:  But it's just -- it's -- yeah.  It's interesting.  Like, I feel, like, you know, when I'm, like, officially married or whatever, you know, people recognize that a little bit more.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's, like --
L:  Definitely.
R:  You know, y- -- you'll --
L:  They -- they take it more seriously and, like, "Okay.  They're really together now".
R:  It says you're a family.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  It's so interesting --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- how just, like, one little step changes everything so much.
L:  Yep.  So, you guys wanna have kids, pretty much, right away?
R:  Not, um, like -- yeah.  Probably, like, in the next, like, three years.  I mean, he is, kind of, scared about it but, for me, I'm like, "I wanna do it" you know?
L:  He's scared of having kids?
R:  Yeah.  I think he is.  I think most men are a little bit, maybe?  I don't know.
L:  Yeah.  Because, ah, they know -- well, what do all the movies tell guys?  The TV's that once you have a kid --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- the wife expects, you know, this that and the other.  They can't go out anymore --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they think that, you know, their life has ended and it's all about, you know, the wife and the kid.  But, in my house, I -- I definitely let my husband have time to go out --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, whenever, ah -- he calls me up and says, you know, "Can I hang out with my friend?"  And -- and I say, "Yeah".
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause they're not in bars.  He goes to his house.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Or they'll play tennis or they'll d- -- they're -- they do something that I think is acceptable.  If he was saying, "Can I go out, you know --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- to the strip club?"  He's never -- he'd -- thank god, he's not into that.  But then --"
R:  Right.
L:  -- I would say, "Hell, no" you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  But -- yeah.  You gotta give them still time --
R:  Ace.
L:  -- because if you tell them no, then they really, you know -- then they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- then they're, like, "Oh, I'm strapped to the house.  I can't do anything" and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know?
R:  And they start to see the family as, like, negative instead of positive.
L:  Exactly.  And --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it doesn't have -- they can -- you can have a balance.  You can have your wife and kids and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- still see your friends.  Maybe, not as often.  Maybe not, you know, three times a week but --
R:  But they'll --
L:  -- you know, if you go a couple of times a month, that's acceptable.
R:  Yeah.  That's all.
L:  Because they know -- they know.  They're trying to balance everything.  They're trying to balance work, home life --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- kids.  They -- they see that there just isn't enough time to go out that [NOISE] often so --
R:  Right.
L:  You know, my husband's -- my husband's cool with it.  He normally goes out -- he might go out once, like, every two weeks.  Normally, he goes out.  And I don't go out that often at all.
R:  Mm.
L:  I'm -- I'm a stay at home mom.  I'm always in the house and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- we agreed to that but it's -- I guess I just accept it.  He tells me all the time, "Go out whenever you want".  He's fine with it but I don't have that many friends.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, it's hard.  It's harder for me to get out.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  So, when I do get out, I really cherish the time that I get out.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because being home with all three of them -- well, two are in school and one is -- she's ten months. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah.  So --
R:  [LAUGH] That's hard.
L:  Yes.
R:  And it's -- it's funny too 'cause, like, a- -- I'm just -- just from the ages of your kids, it sounds like they're a little bit younger now but then, you know, when they get older, like, it'll be -- just, I'm thinking, again, this whole family thing --
