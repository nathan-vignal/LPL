R:  Hello?  [SIGH]
L:  Hello?
R:  [SIGH]  Hi, how are you?
L:  I'm doing g- good.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  My name is Charlene.
R:  [SIGH]  Hi, my name is Marty.  [SIGH]  Where are you calling from?
L:  Michigan.
R:  Oh, I'm in Pennsylvania.  [LAUGH]
L:  Pennsylvania?
R:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh!
R:  [SIGH]  [LIPSMACK]  So, have you ever d- done this before?
L:  Ah, no, I havn't.
R:  No.  [SIGH]
L:  So, I hear it's about, ah, corporate world and [SIGH] insider trading.
R:  E- exactly.  Exactly.  [LAUGH]  Pretty hot topic I guess.  I don't know.  [SIGH]  So, anyway, what kind of work do you do?  [SIGH]
L:  I, ah -- I [MN] pretty much I don't do anything right now.  I'm, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] laid off and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so I'm -- I'm not doing anything.
R:  Oh!  Do --
L:  And what kind of work do you do?
R:  Oh, I'm a registered nurse.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, well, you've got a busy, busy job.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [SIGH]  A little too busy [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- unfortunately.
L:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  And where is it at now?
R:  Where -- where -- I work in a hospital.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  I work in intensive care in a hospital, in Pennsylvania.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, [SIGH] okay.  [SIGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  Oh, you really do have it hard then, --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- if you work in intensive care [SIGH] --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- I know my mom ... was an intensive carer and [MN] [SIGH] I've seen those nurses working.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [SIGH]  It's kind of like feast or famine, you know, we have our busy days [NOISE] we have our kind of s- slow days too so --
L:  R- right.
R:  -- [NOISE] I guess it evens out.  [SIGH]
L:  Yes.
R:  [SIGH]  So, anyway, well this -- what kind of job did you have [NOISE] before you got [NOISE] laid off?  [NOISE]
L:  I was, ah ...
R:  You worked for Enron, right?  [LAUGH]
L:  Y- yeah.  [LAUGH]  R- right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Yes.  Yeah, I wished I worked for this one with Martha Stewart they got going.  She's -- [SIGH] I guess the -- the pill is really coming around to be, ah, --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- help cancer.
R:  [SIGH]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I heard that.  I heard that.
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  No, I was a manager of an apartment complex.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I got sick and so I had to take some time off to get some tests done and [SIGH] stuff -- take a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- vacation and [MN] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so I'm pretty much, just [SIGH] kicking right now.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Oh, well did you lose your job actually, or are you just not working right now.
L:  No, no, no, no.  I just, ah, [SIGH] taking a break for little bit.
R:  Oh, good.  Good for you.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, I, um, [MN] -- I enjoy my work [SIGH] and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [MN] I like working with people.
R:  [SIGH]  What -- what kind of -- um, is it just like a -- [SIGH] a regular or generic kind of apartment complex [SIGH] or is it for elderly or ...?
L:  [SIGH]  No, it's a generic kind of complex.
R:  [MN]  Yeah, well --
L:  It's --
R:  -- well, that must be fairly challenging I guess.  [SIGH]
L:  Ah, oh, yes, i- it is when --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- you've got people underneath you [SIGH] and -- and you have to really, ah, [SIGH] you know, watch them and [MN] so [SIGH] it's kind of hard playing boss sometimes.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess.  I know I've t- thought about, like, [SIGH] g- getting into like a supervisory kind of position and I don't know if I would really ki- -- I -- I can't really [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [LAUGH] I mean, you know, [SIGH] I have a lot of compassion for people it would be really hard for me, I think, to like really --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- fire somebody, y- you know, it's like --
L:  [SIGH]  That's ... me, exactly, 'cause I had one worker that [LIPSMACK] -- he used to drink on the job [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and by about two o'clock I'm -- I was like, "I'm going to catch [NOISE] you yet".
R:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
L:  And [NOISE] ... I kept on telling him, [NOISE] [SIGH] "I'm going to give you time off.  I'm going to give you time off if you don't stop this" --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [LAUGH] and I said, [SIGH] "If I'm late my big boss", the owner of the company, he come down one day ... and he seen him --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- and he said, "I want him fired".  [SIGH]  I'm like, "Oh, no!"  [SIGH]
R:  Mm.
L:  It was the first time I've ever had to fire somebody --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and I said well, I'm glad it was the last for a while.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  So, I really screen my, ah, workers good now for that.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And [SIGH] I make 'em go to the random drug testing and [SIGH] so they don't know when they're going to get it done.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I -- I come down kind of hard on them now [SIGH] because I had to do that and I thought, "I don't like doing" you know --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- [SIGH] because especially if they're the bread winner of the family and stuff like that that's kind of hard.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, it certainly is, a- a- ah, I think a very much more dog eat dog kind of work than it used to be, you know, I mean, companies actually [SIGH] every once in a while invest in their employees, you know and I -- I don't know that [LAUGH] that really happens too much anymore.  It doesn't in my job, you know.  So, ...  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  And you would think, you know, with there being such a -- a n- nursing shortage that h- hospitals would be [SIGH] a little bit more like, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, kind or, ah, I -- I don't want -- I don't want to say grateful --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because I mean I'm not working for free, you know, I -- I know but at -- at least, like, [SIGH] take a little bit more initiative in -- y- you know m- making sure that their e- employees are happy on the job, you know.
L:  R- right.  Oh, I went and got -- I had to get some t- tests done yesterday and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- [SIGH] but I'll tell you t- the nurses [SIGH] ... were sitting around [SIGH] and I thought, "If I was in supervision --"
R:  [SIGH]
L:  "-- [SIGH] there would be three nurses that wouldn't be working right now".
R:  Yeah, ah, uh-huh.
L:  Because ... they just sat around.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Well, that happens sometimes in our place but usually -- I mean if we are slow, if we don't have a lot of patients, then we get pulled somewhere that does, [SIGH] you know, it's like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, --
L:  Well, I don't believe in ... over ... you know, working a person to death because, you know, [SIGH] you've got in your line of work you've got to be +mentally alert.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, it's a big responsibility, you know --
L:  R- right.
R:  -- it is a -- a really responsible job.  I mean, it's not [SIGH] -- you know, some people say that we make a lot of money --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and we don't make bad money but when you look at ... you know, other jobs that are paying the same money that have, like, so much less responsibility.  You know, corp -- [SIGH] corporate jobs for instance, you know, I mean it's not life or death, you know, when people are making, ah, [SIGH] a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year.  [SIGH]  I wish I was making n- near that, you know.
L:  R- right.  [SIGH]  Yeah, I know I, ah, I was a unit secretary for a while --
R:  [SIGH]  Oh, that -- that's one of the toughest there is, I think, because you get paid, like, crap and you have, like, you really have big time responsibility.  I mean the secretaries if you have a good one [SIGH] on our unit -- I mean they run the place.  They can make you or break you, you know.  [NOISE]
L:  R- right.  And, [SIGH] I'm like, I got burned out.
R:  Oh, yeah, you do.  You do.  It's crazy, you know.
L:  I said, "I -- I -- I've got to do something different".  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  I have a lot of respect for the secretaries.  [LAUGH]  Usually, you know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I always go out of my way to be nice to them 'cause they can kill you, you know, like --
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, because -- yeah, 'cause you're doing fifteen thousand things at once [SIGH] plus you're trying to remember and what you've got to do.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH]  And I was like, [SIGH] -- oh, I did, ah, about five years of it and I said to 'em, "I can't do this no more".
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
L:  I said I'm burned out so bad [SIGH] that, ah -- and then, you know, that's when they started, like, these ten and twelve hour days.
R:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
L:  And I was like, [SIGH] "You've got to be kidding me" --
R:  Yeah,
L:  -- because by the time I had my day off I was crazy.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean it just takes you a day to unwind.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But that's all part of it.  No, I have the utmost r- respect for nurses and [SIGH] -- and stuff like that because I've seen the responsibility [SIGH] that they --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- do have.  [SIGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  And in fact one time I was going to go away and be a nurse.  [SIGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  Ah, I [SIGH] --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I did the foolish thing, got married, you know, and all that stuff instead of that and --
R:  Well, I actually didn't go back to school until I was in my thirties, I guess, my middle thirties to become a nurse, so I'm -- I kind of -- I'm fifty one so --
L:  Oh, are you?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You don't sound like that.
R:  Well, thanks.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, ah, and I'm fifty nine now.
R:  Oh, really?  [MN]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, well you don't sound it either.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  So, ah, yeah I -- I ... chose a different field completely.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I got out of it completely and just went --
R:  Well, you know, it -- it's not a -- I mean I certainly don't -- I don't recommend it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- usually [LAUGH] to people, you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]
R:  I get 'em to think about it long and hard 'cause it is a tough job.  You have to deal with the public, which can be really tough and challenging.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Plus you're dealing with the public usually when they're at their worst because they're sick, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, and it's, ah, [SIGH] --
L:  I --
R:  -- it's hard.  You need a lot of patience and --
L:  Yeah, and then too you're dealing with people that are sitting, [MN] you know, there with the sick person.
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah.  Yeah, the families and, yeah, --
L:  Yeah, -- that's --
R:  -- I know it's ah --
L:  -- what's really hard because I know [SIGH] for me whenever anybody's been in hospital [SIGH] I ask questions.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I mean, you don't give n- nobody nothing [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- unless [SIGH] I know what it is and [SIGH] some of them nurses would be just like, [SIGH] "Oh, I know she's here".  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, and when in LT -- in LT, like so pressed for time but I mean, you know -- you know, and I usually try to [SIGH] make time and, you know, be as straight and as honest and a- answer as many questions as I can.  'Cause usually the doctors a lot of times, they're like -- [SIGH] they're in and out, you know, the patients don't even get a chance to, like, you know, ah, ... say, or ask anything, a lot of them anyway, so ...
L:  [SIGH]  Let's see, my first husband he was in a -- in -- up at the UFM hospital --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [SIGH] and he had his kidneys taken out --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- and, [SIGH] so -- and he was on dialysis and stuff like that.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  One night they gave him the wrong medication.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, boy, his blood pressure shot up like ... you wouldn't believe [SIGH] --
