R:  Hi -- 
L:  Hello.
R:  -- hi.  M- -- 
L:  Hi.
R:  My name is Angie.
L:  Hi Angie.  I'm Suzanne.
R:  Hi Suzanne how are you?
L:  Oh, good.  How are you?
R:  Good.  I'm getting a little bit of a cold but I'm fine otherwise.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH] Where do you live?
R:  I live in Charlottesville, Virginia.
L:  Virginia.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I'm in California.
R:  You're in California?  Where --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in California?
L:  Um, I'm fifty miles north of LA in -- 
R:  Okay.  I used to live in, um, Palatal[?].
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Seven Oaks.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you know where that is?
R:  Cool.  I've heard of it.  I probably wouldn't -- I don't remember exactly where but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah.  Oh, I miss California.  [LAUGH] --  
L:  [LAUGH] I bet.
R:  Um, so our topic is about computers in education --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- today?  Hm.
L:  Yeah.  What do you think?
R:  Um, [MN] I -- 
L:  Do you have children in school?
R:  No, I don't.  Do you?
L:  Yes.
R:  Uh-huh.  What grades?
L:  Ah, my daughter, ah, is a sophomore and my son is in seventh grade.
R:  Oh, okay.  So, maybe you have more opinions on this than [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- I do.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  I don't know if I do.  [LAUGH] No, I -- I can't -- I can't, um, imagine them being able to function without a computer now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, it's just -- there's so much information out there -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that they can obtain for -- you know, for nothing essentially. 
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  And it's -- it's definitely helped with -- you know, sometimes they get stuck on something and they'll ask Jeeves.  Have you ever been to that?
R:  Uh-huh, yeah.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Well, they'll go there and you know, he comes -- directs them around -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and it's good.
R:  Right.  That's good.
L:  And both of them go to schools that have, um, computers -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- in the classrooms.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I guess -- I mean, it seems essential 'cause the world is so reliant on computers now that if you don't learn how to use them --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you're kind of up a creek, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So -- 
L:  Yeah.  I can't imagine.  I mean, I know there's -- there's got to be some little place [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that hasn't been connected or plugged in yet.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  Right.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't -- I don't know.  It's, um -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.  Hm.
R:  I mean, I guess -- 
L:  What would my kids say?
R:  Hm.
L:  Definitely, "Mom".  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] I guess the negative would be if they relied, like -- if teaching -- 'cause I think the, like, teacher student relationship is really important to education and the interaction.  So, like, if it got to the point where they were just trying to substitute computers -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- could basically provide most of the teaching, I think that would be detrimental.  You know, I think the -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that interpersonal relationship is really important.  So --  
L:  Mhm.  Well, both of them have taken classes -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, in how to use the computer and how to, you know, make it do different things.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  Um, you know, not just [inaudible] a word that maybe in the Excel -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [MN] and, um, my son's done a Powerpoint presentation -- 
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- in class -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, he's the younger one.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, my daughter, she goes to a private school and her school, I would say, they rely less on computers in school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, you can go to the library and do whatever you need to do -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- on them.  But, um, I think they use more audio visual -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- kind of stuff.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Like, um, [MN] one of the teachers, she's a Spanish teacher and there's times when she'll plug in, um, [MN] a movie, like a Disney movie -- 
R:  Mm, yes.
L:  -- in Spanish.
R:  Oh.
L:  And it's a Disney movie that all the kids really know.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, like the Little Mermaid.  They know probably every word to it.
R:  [LAUGH] Right.  [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's a good idea.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, so she's used it in that way -- 
R:  Hm.
L:  -- you know, but not -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  It really doesn't -- I guess that my son's teacher must be more plugged in to be able to do -- ha- have every kid do a Powerpoint.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  Definitely.
L:  And I think they have in their classrooms, um, at least two computers.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow.
L:  And that's every classroom.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.  Hm.  Yeah, it's so different, like, from when I was in school [several inaudible words] [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, you're not kidding.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- oh, that's funny.
L:  Mm, calculators were, um -- I'm going to show my age, were -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- really not used much.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Yeah, I remember doing everything on the typewriter.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So -- yeah, computers are good.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I think overall they are.  I think -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, when my daughter starts school in the fall they always send home a permission slip essentially saying that -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, your child could go to these websites that are -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- unauthorized by the school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's a Catholic school which is a bit -- 
R:  Oh, right.
L:  -- funny.  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Like, we're not Catholic.  [LAUGH] So -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I can have a laugh, you know?  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Right.  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's, um -- and it says, you know, you're giving your daughter permission to go on the internet.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I don't know that they've ever run into a problem.  At least if they have, my daughter's never told me about it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know, that's -- you know, all girls' school.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And -- and it's got to be different.  I mean, I think if you had that boy insolence -- 
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  -- I think there could be more, um, misuse of the internet.
R:  [LAUGH] Probably.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, that's a -- does that seem like, ah, it's been a positive for her to go to an all girls' school.
L:  Oh, definitely.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  She's so +self -- self assured.
R:  Oh, that's so great.
L:  So confident.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Much different than I was.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, I'm that way now.  But -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, you know, I was very timid -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- when I was in high school.
R:  Right.  Oh, that's very --
L:  So -- 
R:  -- interesting.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  My friend -- a good friend of mine went to Wellesley[?] so she went to an all women's college --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and it sounds like that was, you know, just such a d- -- totally different experience than going to a coed college in terms of just kind of developing that sense of being empowered as a female [LAUGH] you know, in a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- different environment.  So, hm --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's pretty neat.  Is she happy about going?  Like, is she -- 
L:  Yeah, she loves it.
R:  She loves it, yeah.
L:  She loves it.  She -- she just lives in horror of going to the local high school.
R:  Oh.  Uh-huh.
L:  She's heard stories.  Some of her friends from -- you know, they did junior high at the private school and then they went over to the public school and -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- now they've come back.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And most of them have these stories that are just -- 
R:  Hm.
L:  -- you know?  One of the girls said, "Oh" you know, "I saw so and so that used to go to the private school -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I saw her hanging out with the pot heads.
R:  Mm.
L:  Oh, man, she must be, you know, smoking pot".
R:  Oh.
L:  Well, my [LAUGH] -- my daughter doesn't mess around.
R:  Ah, right.
L:  And next time she saw her she [LAUGH] looked her in the eye and said, "Are you smoking now?"
R:  Oh, really?  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] And the girl -- [LAUGH] Danielle goes, "No". 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  "Then why are you always hanging out with the pot heads?"
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  She said, "Because they're the nicest group".  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] Wow, that's great, so at least she's very assertive.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that's really cool.  What grade did you say she's in- -- 
L:  She's -- 
R:  Like -- 
L:  -- a sophomore.
R:  -- soph- -- ah, sophomore, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Huh.  That's very cool.  Mm.  Hm.
L:  So -- 
R:  Computers in education.  [LAUGH] --
L:  I can't really see a -- 
R:  [LAUGH] Say much else about it.
L:  -- a -- I can't see a down side.  You know, I took a -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [MN] um, Microsoft Office -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- over the internet, essentially.
R:  Oh, like a course on how to use it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Step by step -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and then I had a phone contact if I got stuck.
R:  Hm.
L:  And I loved it.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  It was -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you know, kind of self paced.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If I got real behind they'd call me [LAUGH] and say, "What are you doing?"  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] Oh.
L:  But, um, yeah, I feel like I learned it well.
R:  Yeah.  That's --
L:  And I have the -- 
R:  -- cool. 
L:  -- certificate.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Which is nice.
R:  Yeah.  Ah, that's very cool.
L:  Yeah, and I -- you know, I think you can almost do any level of education -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, go on and after your bachelors -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- tack on something else and -- 
R:  Yeah.  Well -- 
L:  What kind of work do you do?
R:  [MN] I'm, um, a graduate student in psychology right now.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] So, I'm doing -- [several inaudible words] about the computer, I think they have better computers in probably your daughter's school than we [LAUGH] have in our -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- ah, student room at the university.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Well, it -- okay, so it's a -- um, [MN] a state run university in other words?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- University of Virginia.
L:  So -- 
R:  Yeah -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause it -- it all depends, like, what department you're in, you know, like the well funded departments like law or [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know, business have the really nice computers.  But --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we don't really have the really --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] You get the -- 
R:  -- good ones.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- remnants, huh?
R:  Though it's amazing, ah, how much time you can waste on comput- -- on technology -- 
L:  Oh.  I know.
R:  -- 'cause I ran -- like, this weekend I tried using a new, like, um, [MN] kind of like a f- -- a zip drive but a different kind of little --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- thing you can plug in that you can transfer files.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And there was -- it had some installation software that had a bug in it so my whole keyboard stopped working and everything --
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  -- locked up.  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And it took me like, you know, three hours of talking on the phone to a friend of mine who's a computer person --
