L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  I'm Barbara in Vermont.
R:  I'm Elanora[?] in California.
L:  I keep getting people from California. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's where people live -- in California. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I guess. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] So, um --
R:  Well --
L:  [NOISE] I guess the topic is family.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They said -- yeah?
R:  Hm?  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I have a family.
L:  So, um, what does family mean to you? [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH] Ah, it means people that care about you and support you and love you and wanna be around you and give you -- give you the time of their day.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, ah, be there in time of need.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It could be a relative or anybody else.
L:  So, not necessarily a relative?
R:  Not necessarily.  No.
L:  Okay. [NOISE] Um ...
R:  What does it mean to you?
L:  I think about the same thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, ah, yeah.  It means, m- -- biological family and, um, it includes my dog and my cats. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- they're certainly part of my family.
R:  Oh, what's your dog's name?
L:  Mac.
R:  Mac?  And what's your cat's [LAUGH] name?
L:  I have, ah, Sophie --
R:  Sophie?
L:  -- and Smokey.
R:  And Smokey? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  We have a gecko too -- it's my son's -- but I don't consider him [LAUGH] part of the family.
R:  [LAUGH] Uh-oh.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Uh-oh. Why don't you consider him part of the family? [LAUGH]
L:  Well, he's -- he's this lizard and he eats crickets and it's just not -- not, like, anything you'd cuddle of with.
R:  Uh-oh.  He --
L:  So --
R:  -- doesn't provide enough entertainment, huh?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  He stays in his tank. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh.
L:  So --
R:  That could be pretty interesting.  A gecko. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, it would be if my son took care of it, which he doesn't. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-oh.
L:  So, we do. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, anyway.  Um --
R:  I bet he doesn't spend his allowance on him [LAUGH] even. [LAUGH]
L:  No, he doesn't.
R:  Oh, no.  Then w- --
L:  Well, it's --
R:  What was the purpose of getting him a pet?
L:  My husband let him get it. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Without telling him all the rules and all that good stuff?
L:  Yeah.  He just, you know -- he came home with it and he knew he was in trouble the minute [LAUGH] he walked in the door. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH] They were [LAUGH] both in trouble. [LAUGH]
L:  They were.  Yes.  Yes.  Well, except my husband's supposed to be the adult, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  So --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I guess, ah, family are people you go through things with and they make funny stories later, hopefully.
R:  Yes.  The amusing part.
L:  Yeah.
R:  There's always the amusing part.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  Well, I -- I have, in my family, my i- immediate family, ah, myself and, um -- that lives in my household, just myself.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But I have four sons.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And my mother is still living and I have, um, three -- three sisters with my father and then my father was married two times before he married my mother so I have two other sisters [SIGH] and, um, but the -- we don't have a big, big family.
L:  Well, that's a lot.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That is a lot.
R:  That's a lot.
L:  Do you -- do you keep up with your sisters?
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.  Yeah.  My sister -- my oldest sister keeps up with her and my older brother keeps up with her.  I'm the youngest.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so, she and I don't get along.  We got into a argument quite a few years back when my brother retired and I told her she loved my brother more than she loved me and so she didn't like that.
L:  Mm
R:  So, she never forgot it to this day.
L:  Mm.
R:  You know?  It's always things that divide family, like, things like that.
L:  Well, and when people let 'em.  I mean everybody's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- gonna say something somebody doesn't like. [NOISE] But --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  To me, the idea of a family is, y- you know, you -- you accept some of that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You don't --
R:  We're gonna have a family reunion and -- coming up this month on the twenty -- twenty sixth, twenty --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- seventh, twenty eighth in, um -- in Arkansas.  And so, I guess I'm gonna see my sister but my brother is gonna be staying with her daughter.  And her daughter is a year younger than me and she's more my equal but she's compatible with my brother because she's married and has children and then my brother is married and has a child.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Willie[?] Mae[?], her kids are outta the house but my brother's son, he's graduating -- as a m- matter of fact, a couple of weeks from now -- from high school.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, they have that in common, you know, that they're a married couple.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] So, I guess that's okay but my sister --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  has just --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- "Nobody is gonna come and stay with me ever again". [LAUGH] No- nobody wants to. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh. [LAUGH] So, are -- are your --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- sons grown and outta the house?
R:  Yes.  All f- -- yes.  All four of 'em.  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  Except, they moved in with grandma.  You know?
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, they're outta my house because my house is too small.  I live in a little apartment -- condo.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, my mom has a big house so she has room enough, you know -- for them.
L:  Yeah. [PAUSE]
R:  But, ah, we just went up to Santa Monica this weekend --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, ah, had a little, just, kinda, um [LIPSMACK] -- what do you call when you get lost from the rest of the family members? [LAUGH] And well, we didn't have a cellphone or anything to get in touch with each other but --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- but, um, I was determined, you know, to not -- to leave there without my son.  And --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- he's a disabled person like myself.  I'm disabled too -- mental disability.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, ah, [SIGH] I was determined not to leave there without my child because --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- I knew he was gonna return and if he didn't return to where I had parked the car he was gonna return to, um -- to, um, the promenade.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, I was -- I was walking up and down, up and down, up and down looking for him and then I contacted the police and had them looking for him.  You know?  But it was just a bond that's between, you know, mother and child or between any family member that really, really does care about you.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, that you're not gonna leave 'em.  I mean, I wouldn't of gotten home and waited for a collect call.  You know, and he's way in Santa Monica.  That's, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- my god, over ... what?  Thirty miles.
L:  Well, did he show up?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yes.  He showed up on Santa Monica Boulevard, which was about three blocks from where the promenade is.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, ah, he was standing there on the corner and he was so glad to see us. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I bet
R:  When the car pulled up, he was so happy. Oh.  He got his butt in that car but he was talking better.
L:  Yeah.
R:  He was talking better.  Yeah.  But he had just walked away.  He didn't say, "I'm going over to the beach" or anything.  He just walked away.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But then I had my back turned 'cause I was in the store with my sister doing some shopping.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Watching her shop -- I wasn't doing [LAUGH] no shopping. [LAUGH]
L:  I'm glad. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  I was watching her spend her money. [LAUGH] She was borrowing [LAUGH] money from me and then --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- then I got caught up in that instead of watching him.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I'm glad he came back.
R:  Oh, thank you.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I know my -- well, my son has taken off on us a couple of times and trips into -- to different cities and just -- he'll go h- -- when he was -- I don't know -- eleven, twelve, thirteen, he'd go hide in a doorway --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and -- and, ah --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  With -- he -- he's -- he's got a lot of problems.  Um, and then [SIGH] eventually, he'd come out. [LAUGH] One --
R:  Oh, just to turmoil you?
L:  Yeah.  One time --
R:  To put you in turmoil.
L:  -- he went back to the h- hotel room and he had a key --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he had the key and he went in and [LAUGH] he wouldn't let us in. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my god.
L:  And so I -- we had to th- threaten to c- -- go get the -- the hotel people and if we did that we was gonna have him turn off the television so he couldn't --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- watch TV.  So [LAUGH] --
R:  Mm.
L:  So --
R:  He's an only child?
L:  Then he let us in.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  We had -- we -- he -- we didn't get him until he was ten so --
R:  Oh, I see.  Mhm.
L:  We took him in and then, ah -- ah, but he had -- he still has a lot of difficulties.  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, right now, we -- he's eighteen but he's not home and, um, we're just, kinda, getting used to him not being -- living at home and being a kid in the house, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  A big -- that's a big family change. [NOISE]
R:  Yes.  It is.
L:  And so, I think the other -- 'nother thing about family is it's -- doesn't stay the same.  You know?
R:  No.  It grows.
L:  It -- well, it grows and then t- --
R:  It changes, huh?
L:  It changes a lot.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um ...
R:  Our family change is that there's a newborn.  He ain't newborn -- newborn no more but he doesn't know how to talk.  He's a year and a half.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Uh-huh.  And he comes over and grandma was talking to some of the other grandkids and she bent over --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and to make herself as high as -- you know, as short as they were --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as the little grandchild was and the baby grandchild walks around and looks right up in grandmother's face. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
