L:  Ah --
R:  Hello?
L:  Ah, hello.  Go ahead. [LAUGH]
R:  Hi.  This is Lorraine I'm in Louisville, Kentucky.
L:  Uh-huh.  Ah --
R:  What's your name?
L:  My name is Ellie and I am in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
R:  Oh, great.
L:  Yes.  And --
R:  How's the -- how's the weather over there?  Has it cleared up?
L:  The weather's -- we're about -- it's about to storm --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and -- I think.  Well, that's okay.  We need it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] And, ah, I guess we're supposed to be talking about what does family mean to us?
R:  Yes.  It --
L:  Would you like to go first? [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you can go first.  That'll be fine.
L:  Okay.  Ah, I guess -- I don't know.  Family means, ah -- it's a support system.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's holding each other up and giving people the space they need to grow.  Ah, as a matter of fact, I've just got into a situation with my son who's having a very bad time and -- and I -- you know, I wanna rush right out there and help him and he's thirty two and he's been pretty responsible and I realize that this is a big thing for him.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, he just lost his job and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- today and, um, you know, I wanna fix this and I know that some of these things, he's got to figure out on his own.  So, I'm trying to balance, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- part of this families thing and I wanna help him but I also know that I need to let it -- let things happen so that he can grow.
R:  Right.
L:  So, that's, kind of, um, what I think family is.  You know, it's -- it's a support structure but it's also, um, a place where, maybe, people can be who +they are -- who they are and grow.  Mm.
R:  Right.  I --
L:  I guess.
R:  Yeah.  I agree.  Um, I'm thirty five and single so I thought this is an interesting topic 'cause family means a lot to me for -- even though I'm single.  My sister and her husband and four children live in the same city as I do and, you know, I've had opportunities to move but I haven't wanted to leave because, you know, family --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- means a lot.  It is a support system.  People who love you --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- when you don't deserve [LAUGH] love --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- probably. [LAUGH] Um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, it just means all the world and I think, ah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that --
L:  Um.
R:  It just means more even -- I know -- it sounds cliche but it still -- it does seem to mean more after September eleventh even --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- today that it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  As it's so precious that you don't want to --
L:  Yes.  And I moved to Tulsa from Las Vegas, I guess, because of family.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I raised my children.  I'm divorced.  I'm fifty three and my son and my granddaughters live here and they weren't planning on moving and over a series of events I finally decided that I was living single there by myself.  My other son -- well, he lives in California but here's where my grandchildren are and I said, you know, that I need to be here --
R:  Right.
L:  -- with them.  I'm missing out on things and there's nothing holding me here now so that's --
R:  Oh.  And it --
L:  -- why I made the decision. [LAUGH]
R:  It -- yeah.  And it's so precious to watch children grow up and to have an impact --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- on their life.  And I think extended family is important too because, you know, parents, um, have such a large responsibility that they can't possibly do it all themselves.  Oh, I --
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  I take being an aunt very seriously.  I try to.
L:  Mhm.  And y- you've never married?
R:  No.  M- m- --
L:  At the -- uh-huh.
R:  It just hasn't worked out.  You know?
L:  Well, I understand.
R:  If I like them, they don't like me or [LAUGH] ...
L:  Well, I've been single for s- -- ah -- ah, as long as I've been married, I guess.  Sixteen years --
R:  Right.
L:  M- -- seventeen married and sixteen single and I haven't found anybody to make it stick either and that's, kinda, frustrating. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It is, kinda --
L:  Y- --
R:  -- frustrating.
L:  Yeah.  Do --
R:  Especially when family means a lot to you and -- you know, I --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I tell people I'm, like, a single girl -- no -- a stay at home mom trapped in a single girl's life. [LAUGH] You know?
L:  Oh, you have children?
R:  No.  I don't but --
L:  Oh.  Oh, I --
R:  -- that's what I'd really like to do.
L:  Oh.  Oh, I see.
R:  That would be my ideal to [LAUGH] --
L:  Kentucky.  Now, I've been to Inez, Kentucky.  Are you anywhere around a little town called Inez?
R:  Inez?  Now --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um --
R:  -- I know where Inez is but I can't place it.  You know?
L:  Mm.
R:  Um --
L:  I'm not sure exactly.  I mean, I haven't been there for thirty two years.
R:  Yeah.
L:  When I was married, my, ah, husband and I went down to visit his grandma and she lived in one of the ho- -- actually, the hollers. [NOISE]
R:  Ah, yes.
L:  There you call 'em hollers?
R:  [LAUGH] Yes.
L:  She was seventy two years old, lived in a cabin that -- that she just got plumbing in that year, by herself and had a rifle and she went out and shot --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [LAUGH] squirrels, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and things like -- and she was -- she was quite a lady.
R:  Well, it sounds like it.
L:  I was real impressed with, ah --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, I wouldn't wanna live down there but it was -- you know, for a long term but it was interesting.  Really interesting --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to go down there --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and see it.
R:  Um, I can't s- -- I'm in --
L:  It's changed a lot, I'm sure.
R:  Yeah.  Well, some parts have.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Some parts have. [LAUGH]
L:  Do you live in the city?
R:  I live in the city.  Louisville's the biggest city.  We've got about, um ...  Well, we just incorporated into the county so now we're like --
L:  What city I'm sorry?
R:  Louisville.
L:  Oh.  Uh-huh.
R:  Where the Kentucky Derby is.
L:  Oh.  Mhm.
R:  And so now, we're, supposedly, the sixteenth largest city in the United States because the county and the city mer- --
L:  The sixteenth?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.  That is big.
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  That's bigger than Tulsa.
R:  Well, if you merged with your county, you might be bigger. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  Mhm.
R:  So, anyway, I don't n- -- remember what we used to be.
L:  Mm.
R:  I think we were --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- thirty or forty or something like that.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, that's pretty big.  So, it's different.  It's one of these situations where it's different in Louisville than it is in the rest of the state, you know?
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause it's -- it's city as --
R:  It's very city.
L:  -- opposed to the rest the --
R:  You know, Lexington's pretty big and, um, up around Cincinnati.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It -- yeah.  And it's city but then, um -- and it -- but most of the state is actually rural.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, you know, it's -- it's just a different way of living.
L:  Yes.  I forgot your name.
R:  Lorraine.
L:  Lorraine?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Lorraine.  So --
R:  So --
L:  You, ah -- aren't by any chance, um, somebody use- -- that, ah, gets the RMC newspaper?
R:  No.
L:  Oh.  Okay.
R:  My sister, somehow, found out about this.  S- --
L:  Oh.
R:  She does all these secret shopper things.
L:  Okay.  Mhm.
R:  Do you get the RMC newspaper?
L:  RMC refunding?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yes, I do.
R:  What is that ex- --
L:  That's how I learned about --
R:  What --
L:  It's, ah -- it's a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] -- a w- -- a website and a paper --
R:  Okay. [NOISE]
L:  -- um, [LIPSMACK] newsletter that tells you all about bargains, how to get money back on things, how to get coupons, how to do things for incentives, like, on the computer, like s- -- points for gift cards.  It --
R:  Oh.
L:  Just anything that has to do --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- with making money and a lot of it does have the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- secret shopping and information and survey information and so on.  And that's how I found out about this.
R:  Hm.
L:  And I was surprised 'cause I signed up a month ago and I know a lotta times I'm either online or I'm gone in the evening -- early part of the evening and I just have never had a call.  So, this is my first call.
R:  Oh, really?  Well, I'm --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- had -- I got one, like, the very day I signed up -- that night.
L:  A- --
R:  And then I've had several where I haven't been home or, like, the topic I knew nothing about and I thought, "How could I talk about that for ten minutes?"  And -- and you can call -- they sent me [NOISE] an email with the phone number where you could dial in and put in your PIN code and then you could choose the time.  So, this was my third one so I figured I'd just do that. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  It h- --
L:  So, we're so- -- ha- -- a- -- okay.
R:  It was funny.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  The -- the last conversation I had was about, [LIPSMACK] um, if the increased security measures at the airport were really helping --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- curb terrorism or not?  And so the lady that I was talking to, she'd never been on an airplane.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh.
R:  And so, she didn't really have anything to say so it was, kind of, a long ten minutes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But you're easy to talk to. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  She was, kinda -- she said, "Well, I've never been on an airplane".  So --
L:  Oh.
R:  So, my sister read somewhere that they, basically, are doing some, kinda, test -- voice recognition test or something.
L:  Oh.
R:  That's what it -- what it's for.
L:  Oh.  I've --
R:  For like -- that's why they wanna know if you're using a handheld cordless phone or what --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- kind of phone you're having.
L:  Whatever it is, if they pay me the ten dollars, I'll be happy to talk to anybody [LAUGH] --
R:  I know. [LAUGH]
L:  -- or whatever it is.  Ah, a- as far as family, I guess, getting back to that, um --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] oh, what was I gonna ask you?  Do you have parents still living?
R:  Yes.  And they --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- live in Florida so, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Mom and Dad are always coming up here to see all of us.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they wind up staying with me.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, it's a lot -- then Mom has, like, a -- a disease called scleroderma.
L:  Oh, yes.  Uh-huh.
R:  So, it's better for her to be where it's a little bit warmer.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, um, that's why they're living down there.  But they --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- miss everybody all the time. [LAUGH] So, I have company -- I probably have company about five, six weeks outta the year when --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- she's staying here all the time.
L:  So, all of your family -- all of the children live in --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the one area?  Oh.
R:  It's just my sister and I.  So --
L:  It seems that the more -- that society is getting so much more mobile you h- -- don't have people living close by.  You know, people --
R:  Right.
L:  -- anymore.  I mean, I've got one -- like I said -- one son that lived in Las Vegas when I did and he's -- he's single and he's -- doesn't have a girlfriend so he, kinda, moves around and so I don't follow him around [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and see where he's going to stay 'cause -- but my older son does.  So, that's why I came here and, ah, [LIPSMACK] that's -- so the -- I'm an only child --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I don't have any brothers or sisters and my parents have been deceased for ten and twenty five years.
R:  Ah.
L:  It's quite a while -- a long time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And so, ah, I don't have a lot of family.  I've got some cousins in Pennsylvania and I --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- have cousins in f- -- I have family in Europe --
R:  Oh, neat.
L:  -- that are -- yes.  Um, I -- a lot of my family I've only met once or twice.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They are from Yugoslavia --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and Germany and they've come here to visit occasionally when my parents were still living.  But, ah --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- so, I, kind of, um -- I -- I'm trying to learn and remember more th- the things my parents have told me.  My parents were, um -- speaking of family, I guess, we -- we were m- -- as a -- when I was a little girl -- I was two and a half when we came here -- we were one of the last groups of people -- of refugees to come in through I- -- Ellis Island --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- after World War -- yeah.
R:  Oh, that's interesting.
L:  So ...  And, um, I have that --
R:  So, you came from Yugoslavia?
