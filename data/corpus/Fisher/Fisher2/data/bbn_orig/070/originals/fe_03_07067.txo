L:  Hi.  I'm Patty. [NOISE]
R:  Hi.  I'm Candy.
L:  Nice to meet you.
R:  Nice talking to you.
L:  [NOISE] So, we're talking about family and what it means to us, huh?
R:  That's what they say the topic is.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, that's easy enough. [LAUGH]
R:  How is -- that's what I said, "Oh, I can handle that".
L:  [LAUGH] Ah, well, I am a mother of, um, two and I have a stepdaughter and, um, we enjoy spending a lot of time together as well as my husband and, um, both of our families.  How about you?
R:  I have got --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- m- -- a son and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- two stepdaughters who have -- well, they're out of the house but two stepdaughters and they both have had children and so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- we're an extended family and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we do a lot of things together but -- yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I think family's more than just your immediate family, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  It's other people that you can consider family.  Like, I have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- aunts and uncles that really aren't an uncle -- ah, aren't aunts and uncles --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but, you know?  Known them all my life and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- whatever.  So, that's what we call them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] You know?  Ah --
L:  Yeah.  Well, I come from, ah, a very small family.  My, um, parents got divorced when I was a couple of year- years old and my mother only has her, um, mother and stepfather [LAUGH] and he n- -- ah, they don't have any other kids.  He doesn't have any other kids from prior marriages.  Ah, my mother, um, had a brother and that was it.  On my dad's side, um, you know, we had -- he had several brothers and sisters but [NOISE] since my parents were divorced when I was very young, um, he's in another state and I don't ever hear from that side of the family at all.  And, um -- so, for me, it's very nice because I married into an Italian family -- my husband is Italian -- and, um, they've got lots of family. [LAUGH]
R:  I was gonna say and they're family oriented and --
L:  Yes.  Yes.  We --
R:  -- do things together.
L:  Almost every weekend, we get together, um, either pool party or [NOISE] barbeque or -- you know?
R:  Right.
L:  We trade off houses.  One weekend we'll stay at our house, the next weekend, [NOISE] we'll go to my mother in laws and, you know, another weekend we'll go over to my sister in laws and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- we're over at the aunt's house.  And [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  There's always somewhere to be, something to do.
R:  Yeah.  Unfortunately, my family's all --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- split across the United States from --
L:  Are they?
R:  Yeah.  California to Florida --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and up in New Hampshire.  So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, we get together a couple of times a year.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I try to at least.  And --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- visit more and that but makes things tough.  Very depressive[?].  Do with what you got and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- bring your friends and everybody else in and spend lots of time with --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, with the people that you care about, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  But -- yeah.  Well, we just had two new additions to our family.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Our family just keeps growing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  One stepdaughter had a son and then my niece had another son.  So --
L:  Wow.  Congratulations.
R:  The past weeks, ah, seems, like -- go fathom -- go, you know -- you gotta go fifteen years with nobody new in the family and then all of a sudden, boom, boom.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You have a baby boom.
L:  Yep.
R:  Like they're talking about.  So --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, you know, it's exciting.  It's nice to see new babies coming along.
L:  Yeah.  Definitely.
R:  Keep the family -- keeping g- -- keep it going.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But -- yeah.  We like to spend a lot of time together.  My husband, unfortunately, is a truck driver so he's --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- on the road a lot.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But when he is home, we -- like you say -- try to do stuff and get out and see family and do what we can and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- we spend a lot of time together doing different things that, hopefully, interests all three of us and not just one of us.
L:  Right.
R:  Although, it seems me being outnumbered 'cause it's a -- 'cause I have a son and it seems more we do what the guys want [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- than what -- you know, shopping's not on top of their list.
L:  No.  No.
R:  You know?
L:  Well, my kids are, ah, young.  My, ah, son is eleven, my daughter's ten and then my stepdaughter is seven.  So, we're slowly growing out of the children's things and -- and getting into more teenage things, which is quite interesting. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  As you say, even the little ones grow up quickly.  L- --
L:  Oh, yeah.  They do.
R:  They're, like, three or four years above what I was at that age.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Definitely.
R:  Yeah.  It's amazing how they grow so quick and --
L:  Mhm.  The times change.
R:  That's right.
L:  You know?
R:  And unfortunately, families seem to be g- g- growing further and further apart and not as close knit as they used to be.
L:  Right.  I agree.
R:  So --
L:  It's --
R:  Tougher keeping the family together and having it like when we grew up, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Of course, it's a lot to do with the way the world is these days too.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  It interferes with the family.
L:  And -- and everybody is so busy.  You know, I mean, I know we have things that, you know, me and my husband would like to do but then we gotta stop and think, "Oh, we have kids" you know?  We need to have them around their family and try to keep the family going.
R:  Right.
L:  So, even though we'd like to be off with our friends doing something -- and even if, you know, they have children also, all the children can get together but, you know, it seems like if the family calls and says, "We're having dinner.  You wanna come over?"  And we're, like, "Yeah" you know, we drop everything else and go and do that.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And especially since, um, his daughter lives, primarily, with her mother, um, we only have her, like, every couple of weekends.  So, you know, especially when she's here, we try to do as much as we can, you know, with the kids and spend our quality family, family time then and [NOISE] -- and be around all the relatives as much as we can so they can all spend --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- time together and grow up --
R:  Right.
L:  -- together.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And hopefully, they won't be, you know, spread out later on in life.  Hopefully, they'll remember their family ties and -- and keep it strong.
R:  Yes.  Families are, unfortunately, drifting apart due to distance --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- as well as --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- too many other things and -- and kids dying and everybody's dying.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, kids would rather sit and play Nintendo or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- watch television.  They're becoming a passive --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- generation --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if we --
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- don't keep 'em --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- moving.  And so, I --
L:  Yeah.  You really have to keep your eye on 'em.  I mean, my son i- is [NOISE] typical.  He -- he would love to just sit in front of the TV and either watch cartoons or TV programs or play the Playstation.  And he's only allowed a certain amount of time and -- and that's it.  You're done. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  And, ah, that's what's nice when we do get together -- the whole family -- um, i- -- like, I said, a lot of times it's at our house.  We've got the pool and, um, all together, for the most part, we generally have five kids together.  And, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they -- they love to play in the pool.  They'll spend all day --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in the pool, you know, and we'll have a barbeque on the patio and -- and we just sit and hang out outside together.
R:  Right.
L:  So, that keeps them active.  Ah, you know, even though they're confined to the pool area [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.  Is --
L:  -- they're running and jumping and -- and moving --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so much they -- they burn off the calories and the energy that they need to.
R:  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  There's too many things that influence families.  You just have to do the best you can trying to pull them all together and --
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- spending time with them and keeping an eye on 'em and all that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- wonderful stuff.
L:  Yeah.  The --
R:  Too much the --
L:  The --
R:  -- society trying to pull 'em in other directions.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  And that's -- you know, that's the other thing is you gotta be careful, you know?  It's not like when we were young where you could just go outside and hang out all day long, you know, down the block, around the corner, wherever you wanted to go.  You know, now, I'm afraid to even let my kids outside my front door.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, I mean, we live in -- in a relatively safe neighborhood but, um, you know, it's -- it's, kind of, rural so there's not a lot of traffic but we do have some traffic coming through.  But, um, you know, I'm constantly -- every two minutes, I'm looking at the window to make sure they're s- still there. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  You know?  And they're only allowed to go, you know, like six houses down because I can't see past that, you know, looking out through the window.
R:  Right.
L:  So -- an- and I feel bad for them because I remember when I was little, I mean, I -- at their age even, I was down around the corner, around the block, in somebody else's house, over at the other person's house. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  I was everywhere, you know?
R:  So was I.  All over.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's like one big family in your neighborhood --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- at that point.
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.
R:  Now, you're lucky if you know your neighbors.
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.  I'd --
R:  Yeah.  But -- you know?  So --
L:  I was just thinking this morning, I've got a neighbor -- there's an empty lot between me and my next door neighbor and I don't even know her name.  I -- you know, when we see each other she never waves.  I've waved a couple of times and she doesn't wave back.  So, I've, kinda, given up.  But [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know?
R:  Some people just --
L:  Then on the other side of us, we have a family and they have, ah, four kids now.  It's a younger couple and -- and we do, um, try to, you know, associate with them a little bit more and try to do some things with them.  You know, but they're -- they try to spend a lot of time with their families too.  So, sometimes it's at their house, sometimes it's at their family's house.  So, you know, we try to -- try to keep in touch and I know, you know, it is becoming such a -- a rarity to have friends and family near you, you know, that you talk to associate with.  We try to keep, you know -- instill in our kids that you need to be friendly but you need to be cautious.  You know, you need to spend that quality time with your family, with your friends ...
R:  Right.
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah.  The family -- like you say -- is just, unfortunately, drifting apart because there's so much constraint on everybody's time and so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- many two family -- two parent family working and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, kids at daycare so they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- can -- school is bringing up a lotta kids and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Neighborhoods k- -- parents don't watch kids and the kids are out on street corners getting into whatever.
L:  Exactly.
R:  So -- yeah.  But I don't know.  My family seems to -- as big as it gets when one's born, it seems like --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- somebody else disappears or --
L:  Really?
R:  -- whatever.  So --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it's just -- you know?  I mean, I grew up with a brother but I -- and we only have one -- well, she lives -- my husband and I only have one parent still alive so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the family's just, you know -- but we do the best we can and --
