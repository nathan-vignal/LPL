R:  Hello?
L:  [NOISE] Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  My name is Stacey.
L:  Hi Stacey.  I'm M.G. [NOISE]
R:  What is -- Mindy?
L:  M.G.
R:  M.G.?  Hi M.G.  How are you?
L:  Okay.  How are you?
R:  I'm fine.
L:  That's good.
R:  Um, let's see ... I guess, ah --
L:  The topic is what does family mean to me? [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Um ...
L:  Or you. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH] That's a tough one.
R:  I think [MN] family is very, very important.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Ah, it's probably the most important thing to me.  Ah, especially right, you know, at -- well, especially right now at this point of my life.  Um, let's see ...  Um, I'm thirty three and I'm s- still single and I don't have any children but -- so, that's why I think my -- well, my immediate family --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, my parents and my two brothers are just very important to me.  Um, you know, my parents -- I still live at home and they put a roof over my head and they've always been there for me and --
L:  Wow.
R:  So, I think, um, you know, I -- I'd have to say they're the most important thing to me. [PAUSE]
L:  [NOISE] Ah, I would be -- I would say that a family is the most important thing and, um, especially having a strong, stable family.
R:  Mm.
L:  But I have the exact opposite fam- -- ah, experience that you have.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I have a family that was very dysfunctional and I'm single and thirty eight and, um, none of us support each other [LAUGH] and, um -- not that I wouldn't want to.  I mean, I love my brothers and sisters but because I don't support what my parents did, um, they won't talk to me.  And, um, my parents were very, very abusive and there wasn't really a family unit.  Everything was all for public and for show.  But that's made me appreciate other people that have families --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and me wanting a family.  And I've developed my own family, like, f- -- through friends.
R:  Oh, right.
L:  And it's been -- and -- and to me, that family is a very strong and a very important and [NOISE] -- I mean, like, um, to that family I'm just as loyal as I would've been as if it was my biological family.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And we -- like, we go to church together.  I mean, we all belong to the same church and we go out on Sundays for lunch together and --
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  -- um, you know, we spend holidays together.  Um, when one of us is sick, someone's always there.  So, with it -- you know, it's the same.  It's just only that we're not biological.  So --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I had the opposite experience in a biological way but I h- have the same philosophy about family.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because I believe that it should've been that way [PAUSE] biologically.
R:  Mhm.  S- --
L:  And I -- and I really think that families should really do the best they can to work with -- work out their problems but if they can't, then I believe that individuals should try to build a family of their own in some way.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because when I didn't have, like, the surrogate family that I have now, life was just never as full or -- and complete.  It wasn't the same because families are so important.
R:  Right.
L:  And listening to people talk about having a family and the things that they did, it just made me feel like an outsider and it -- you know, noth- -- ah, I didn't -- I didn't really belong to anything.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And this gives me a foundation and a sense of belonging and -- and people always say that you c- -- you know, you can't really make up for what you didn't have but I -- but I still -- now, I have a sense of belonging and -- and my life is so much better.  And, yeah, I didn't have it when I was growing up but I have it now and, ah, maybe it doesn't make up for the past but I have that foundation now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it -- so, it makes me a stronger person now and I -- I'm glad that I didn't just listen to people who said, "Well, you can't get what you didn't have".  'Cause, you know, then I would've never strived to get close to people or ...
R:  Right.
L:  Um, but I think it's really important 'cause, you know, you got to be able to give to people and have that closeness.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] And to set examples for the other people in your life.  Even if you're single, you know, if your brothers or anyone has children, then you can be setting examples at some point, even for them.  For your nieces or nephews or when you're volunteering if -- somewhere that you have a family that's, you know, w- -- functional and working. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Well, I think that's, um, [NOISE] -- that's -- that's really good that you were able to -- to make it positive, the outcome of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Well, it wasn't easy.  I mean, it took --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, lots of years and I just, um -- it -- it -- and I would've balked at anyone who, for the longest time said, you know, "What you need to do is establish this". [LAUGH] But then once I did it, the difference was amazing.
R:  Yeah.  And how long have you been a part of their family?
L:  Um, hm ...  Like, two, three years.
R:  Oh, okay.  Because I have -- I'm c- -- I -- I have a s- -- I'm -- my relationship with my friend's family is, kinda, similar.  I mean, when I say that my parents have been there for me, I mean, you know, when it comes down to, you know, basic --
L:  Right.
R:  -- necessities.
L:  Necessities.
R:  As far as --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, shelter and food on the table and things of that nature.  But as far as, um, you know, if I needed, ah, to talk to someone or help with something, um, I pretty much went to my friend's family --
L:  Right.
R:  -- as well because I think, ah, you know, they were -- they were there for me a lot in that respect, in that sense.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] so, I think, um, you know -- I think, ah [PAUSE] -- I think I was just able to get different, ah -- different things from my family --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and different things from their family and -- but all in all, I think, you know, it's just -- it's so important to -- to have people that you can depend on or ask for help and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and it -- it just -- it helps so much and, you know, I see the things -- or the things that my family has provided or not provided --
L:  Exact- --
R:  -- and again, just like you, you know, I think in the future when I do have a family, um, I will know -- I will be a little bit more prepared and be able to handle things a little differently and --
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  And I'll just, like, um -- I mean, and I -- like, right now, I have, um, a woman and her daughter -- they're roommates of mine right now and they, um -- they don't have any other people living in -- of their family living in this area and -- and it has been interesting to see, like [NOISE] [PAUSE] -- like -- even, like, their family d- -- their extended relatives don't even call them as often as, like, my friends call me.  And -- and, like, I have this long distance plan where you can just, um, call for, um -- it's one price a month, it doesn't matter how often you call.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they don't -- and, ah, I'm, like, "You can take advantage of it if you want.  It's not a problem" and -- and they don't, like, get in touch with each other.  And, ah, like -- and I always think it's so sad because, you know, here I'm giving them an opportunity to find a way to stay touch and they're not there supporting each other.  Like, the mother just had a surgery and no one even called to see how she was doing.
R:  Wow.
L:  And I was, like, "That's so sad".  'Cause, [LAUGH] you know, me, if I had one, all my friends they're, like, there at the hospital or, you know, calling to see just if I'm, like -- have a cold or something.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And so -- and, you know, but they're friends.  They're not even biologically related and, ah, just -- I find it so sad.
R:  Yeah.  That is sad.  That -- that -- that is sad.  An- and, ah -- and that reminds me of what you said before, it, kind of -- you know, when you have people there for you, it makes you feel like you belong.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  I -- I -- I mean, I guess if they have each other, that helps but, ah -- I don't know.  I think it's just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  When you have people around you, family or people that you consider your family --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, it -- it helps.  It gives you a sense of, ah, belonging.  Otherwise, you know, you -- you feel like an outcast.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  And, like, when the mom had the surgery, her daughter's only -- well, at the time, only fifteen and they had just changed those privacy rights for health care and she didn't sign or put an X near something and I wasn't -- and she had a --
