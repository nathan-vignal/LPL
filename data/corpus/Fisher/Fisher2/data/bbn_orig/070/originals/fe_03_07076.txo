L:  Hi.
R:  Hello?  Hi.
L:  My name's Chris.
R:  I'm Leia.
L:  Nice to meet you.
R:  Same here.  Where are you from?
L:  Indiana.
R:  Okay.  I'm in New York.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And we're talking about our families?
L:  Yes.
R:  How broadly are we defining families?
L:  Mm.  I'm not sure.
R:  Going up or down?  Parents, siblings, children?
L:  Ah, well, do you have children.
R:  Yes, I do.  What about you.
L:  I have four.
R:  Okay.  I have five.
L:  Are they grown or are they still little?
R:  [LAUGH] They're still growing. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They're little.  My eldest is thirteen, my youngest is two and a half.
L:  Oh, wonderful.
R:  And yours?
L:  Ah, my oldest is ten and my youngest is one.
R:  Okay.  So --
L:  So --
R:  -- we're getting there.
L:  Pretty close to the same ages.
R:  Yes.  How -- d- -- boys, girls?
L:  Um, all boys except for the two -- well, she's three now.
R:  Okay.  So, we did it backwards.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um --
L:  So, you've all girls?
R:  My oldest is a girl and then I have four boys.
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.  Well, it's rocking and rolling here.
L:  [LAUGH] So, are they involved in a lot of things?
R:  As far as do I shuttle them from place to place?
L:  Right.
R:  Not really.  They're in private school and their days are chokingly long.
L:  Oh.
R:  My -- my oldest son -- my daughter g- -- leaves the house at ten to eight and gets home at five.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  My oldest son really is supposed to leave the house at a quarter to seven and get home at six thirty.  He usually misses the first shift and leaves at eight thirty --
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  -- and gets home at six thirty.  My fourth graders leave at eight thirty and get home at five thirty.  And my baby's out three hours a day.
L:  Wow.  So --
R:  So, when we're home, we're home.
L:  Are you actually in the city?
R:  I'm in Brooklyn.
L:  Oh, my gosh.  We actually talked about moving there at one time.
R:  For what purpose?
L:  Ah, my husband's job.
R:  Oh, okay.  You know what?  It's not a bad place but it's -- it's crowded.
L:  From what we heard, it sounded like it was, kinda, dangerous.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, only at nine eleven.
L:  Well, I mean, just as far crime in general.
R:  Um --
L:  Is it not as bad as it sounds?
R:  You know what?  No.  It's not as bad as it sounds.  And d- -- maybe, it's what you get used to --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but -- but I've been, you know, more rural or more out and h- -- [LIPSMACK] there's some, sort of, security of being close together.
L:  Right.
R:  And, ah, the, um -- the -- the crime's been down since Giuliani came in.  They're crack -- as soon as they crack down on petty crime the bigger crimes stop too.  I take the subway almost every day and late at night, no problem.  Um, ah, but the truth is, no, I don't let my nine year old go to the grocery himself and it's only three blocks away. [LIPSMACK]
L:  Wow.
R:  I guess it's, you know -- but then I -- I d- -- you live in a city?
L:  No.  It's a very small town.
R:  Okay.  And are there bears --
L:  We've got about eight thousand people in the whole town. [LAUGH]
R:  -- and -- and wildlife and --
L:  Yeah.  We see deer when we drive down the road and [LAUGH] --
R:  Bears with a B.
L:  -- raccoons and everything.
R:  B. B. B. B.  Bears.
L:  What?
R:  W- -- bears.  Like mama bear, papa bear?
L:  No.  Deer with a D.
R:  Oh.  Yeah, okay.  Those are pests but they can be dangerous pests.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, you know what?  Everything's a trade off.
L:  Right.
R:  Everything.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, the -- the -- the convenience for us is the crime versus the more, you know -- there's just more cultural stuff and educational opportunities here in the city.  I'm a subway ride from anything.
L:  [NOISE] That's what I thought would be neat about it.  Just being close to everything --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- being able to have the kids [NOISE] grow up where they could see the museums and things like that.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  A -- a trip to the Museum of National History or to the Children's Museum of Manhattan or to the zoo is, like, nothing.  We don't do it as often as we should but it's -- it's accessible.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, but -- but it's a trade off.  You know, in the summer, I take my kids upstate.  I rent a one room shack -- it's a hole in the wall -- um, for a little with my sisters.
L:  Just to get away?
R:  Just to get away.  And we live, like, in squalor.  I can't tell you how disgusting it is.  And the reason we do it there is because, um, the kids can take their bikes and they're outdoors the whole day and there's no concern about strangers or cars or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or anything.  And they just -- they love it.
L:  And that sounds wonderful.
R:  They love it.  I, of course --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm, you know, cranky b- [LAUGH] because it's disgusting. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, but that's -- that's a trade --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- off.  You know?  So, your kids -- y- you don't home school do you?
L:  No.  I don't.
R:  Oh.  Something that made me said that --
L:  Um, they go to the public school but, um, it's -- almost everyone takes a bus to school because it's so much in the country.  N- not very many of the kids are close to the school at all.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But it's a school bus.  It's not, like, a city bus, kinda, thing.
R:  Okay.  So, let's be good and stick to this topic.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, what does your family mean to you?  Or what does the word family mean to you?  Kids, right?
L:  Right.  People that're always there.  Um, I actually just watched a show about adoption.  I thought that was neat that s- -- um, as soon as they got 'em, they became a part of the family.  It wasn't, get used to 'em or -- or adding somebody new it was, "This is my kid that's been added".
R:  That's interesting.  See, if we were gonna do, like, word association, there are so many that go into the word family from commitment and responsibility to pain in the neck to pride and joy and light of my life and -- you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  B- both sides are equally true.  And then, of course, there's the extended family.  Sisters, brothers, cousins, parents.  We live, um, pretty close to family.  My kids have cousins within a mile.
L:  Oh, that must be wonderful.
R:  Um --
L:  Our closest are about two and a half hours away --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Very hard.
L:  -- as far as cousins for them.
R:  Very hard.  And, like I told you, I spend the summer with both of my sisters and between us we have fourteen kids.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And the kids are -- and the oldest is thirteen.  Everybody has friends just between the cousins.  And then on my husband's side, there are, like, twenty seven c- -- um, cousins and the oldest is seventeen.
L:  Gosh.
R:  So, we're talking clan here.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know?  I- it's -- it's interesting.  It's not the typical community setup.  I mean, you know, America's a mobile society.
L:  Right.
R:  And -- and most families --
L:  So many of them are far apart now.
R:  -- live spread apart.  But, you know, we're -- we're, um [LIPSMACK] -- we're Orthodox, we're Jewish, and we tend to cluster in communities.  And it -- it makes -- it makes for a very -- I -- I guess here's a redundancy, a communal environment. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, it's good for the kids though.  Yeah.
L:  I think a little bit more where we're at too.  People sten- -- tend to stick together because of they're -- being a farm community and the -- the families have the children take over the farms.
R:  Mhm.  Oh, okay.  And you make your own family from the community too?
L:  Right.
R:  Right?  A --
L:  Yes.
R:  Y- y- you really have a community, in a sense that is not necessarily there in other places.
L:  Right.  And we've got, probably a half an hour away from us, are the Amish families.  There's a lot of Amish.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so, they've got their own little communities that the family, um -- the children build their house right beside where the parents are.
R:  Mhm.  In Indiana?  Here it's --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Amish?
L:  Yes.
R:  Really?
L:  Yup.  It's a, um -- like, two or three towns are almost totally Amish and then there's a few families that are, kind of, interspersed in between.
R:  Now, that's a fascinating culture.
L:  It is very interesting.  They have a, um, giant swap meet in the summertime and a lot of the Amish bring out their animals to sell and homemade things and stuff like that.
R:  Are they happy?
L:  I think they are.  Yes.
R:  Yeah.  I would -- I would bet that they are.
L:  It's interesting though, um, one of their -- their, um -- I don't know if you call it tradition but when they're sixteen, they get to go out and, kinda, do whatever they want and decide if they wanna --
R:  Right.
L:  -- stay with the faith.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And -- so, a lotta times the Amish children are the wild ones.
R:  Yes.  Because they've been subdued so long.
L:  Right.  Between, like, sixteen and eighteen, they're the ones that get into all the trouble.
R:  But I would bet a lot of them come back.
L:  They do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's really amazing to me.  But I think a lot of that too has to do with the family because that's the way they've been raised and they realize that that's what they were raised to do.
R:  Yeah.  I think they have -- and not -- not just raised to do.  There's gotta be a certain ... [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] I can't say advantage or beauty or tranquility.  There's gotta be a certain security in knowing what's expected of you and what your role is and -- and it's a big world.
L:  Right.
R:  And -- and if you raise kids with an understanding of what -- I guess, what their role in life is.
L:  What's expected.
R:  Yeah.  But -- but more than what's expected.  What they -- what they mean.  What -- that they can matter, that they can contribute and that they count.
L:  Yes.
R:  Ah, I think that's the emphasis.  Not -- not what we expect of you but what you can do -- what you can contribute.
L:  Yeah.
R:  All the kids need to have that self esteem built into them that they -- they matter.  That they make a difference.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's a big part of what -- of what we focus on.  You know, it's not just, um ... [LIPSMACK] okay, this is gonna sound so heavily religious -- please forgive me -- but it's not just, you know, love God, love God, serve God, whatever.  But --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, God loves you.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause -- 'cause you make a difference and he's, you know -- pray -- don't pray to him because, I mean, you got to but he's waiting to hear from you.
L:  Right.
R:  Ah, please.  D- -- you know what?  I didn't mean to get preachy.  That wasn't --
L:  No.  That's fine.
R:  -- the point.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK] But, um -- but same c- -- you know, that, kinda, concept.
L:  Yeah.  I think that has a lot to do with it.
R:  It's interesting.  Anyway, this, um -- this calling [LAUGH] system is starting to get buggy.  I -- I -- d- -- I wonder what they're trying to accomplish?
L:  [LAUGH] I don't know.  Have you done very many calls for them?
R:  No.  No.  A friend emailed me and said, "Please, could you sign up?"  And I said, "All right".  Well, what he wants me [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] It's interesting because whoever I've spoken to has been from all over the place.  So --
L:  Yeah.  I think the last person I talked to actually had just moved here from China.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Also, interesting -- oh, I've only spoken to women.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Huh.
R:  I've not spoken to any men.  I wonder what that -- you know, if that's just --
L:  If that's significant or not.
R:  -- random or -- yeah.  It --
L:  I would bet more women sign up for it than men.
R:  Well, that's what I'm wondering.
L:  Huh.
R:  That's, kind of -- k- -- you know, this, kinda, s- -- unseen social experience.
L:  Right.
R:  W- would a man sign up to talk to a stranger for ten minutes?  Would a man speak to someone who's not a [LAUGH] stranger --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- for ten minutes? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] H- -- especially on the telephone. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Where they couldn't sit next to each and go, "Huh? Uh-huh --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- uh-huh". [LAUGH]
L:  My grandmother, um, just moved to Arizona but she was from Ocean City, New Jersey.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I love to hear the East Coast accent. [LAUGH]
R:  I don't have one.  I don't have any accent.
L:  No.  But it sounds like it. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't have an accent.  You have an accent.
L:  That's what I hear from her all the time. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] It's you honey. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
