R:  Hello?
L:  Yes.  Hi. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  This is Rosemary. [LAUGH]
R:  I'm Carrie.  This is pretty funny, isn't it?
L:  Yes.  It's interesting.  Yes.
R:  Have you done it before?
L:  Ah, no.  No.  Um, well, I was called but I didn't like the topic.  So, this one, I felt I could, um, hold my way pretty good in a conversation.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, ah, family it -- it just happens that, um, I -- I was out trying to find information on my mother who had, um, abandoned me when I was seven years old.  And, um, ah, so, ah, the -- the word family it -- it means a lot to me and, um, I don't even know if she's still alive or not.  I guess -- d- do you have a right --
R:  Yeah.  It's pretty amazing 'cause I was adopted too.
L:  W- -- oh, you were adopted?  I was in foster homes.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, um, they just, ah -- I d- -- I -- I guess, maybe, for money reasons, they didn't want to adopt me.  Um, but, um, i- -- I guess in a way, when you're adopted, you don't, um -- you don't look too much for your real parents or --
R:  Oh, no.  Actually, um, I would love to find my birth mother --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and father.  It -- I'd like to know, like, hereditary --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- health problems and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- where I get my personality from.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because I know I get a lot from my adopted parents from my environment.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, I have some crazy [LAUGH] streaks too and I'm -- I'm betting that's in my genes. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  See, that's a problem because you don't know, um, w- what -- what could be running i- in your -- in your real family, like, health wise.
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  And, um, if you go to the doctors, they'll say, "Well, do you have any of this running in your family or that?"  And what do you tell them, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, ah, I mean -- and like my kids -- I don't know what your age is, but my kids, you know, they'll ask me a lot of times -- they'll say that, you know, they're worried about, um, what their grandparents could've had or whatever, you know?  And I just try to explain to them that -- that I don't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Some- sometimes you're better off not knowing and, you know -- but, um, m- my kids have a, um -- a -- a very strong sense of family.  I think, maybe, because of what they knew I went through.  Do -- do you have children or ...?
R:  No.  No.  I -- I don't have children.  I have dogs.
L:  Oh.
R:  I'm forty one.
L:  Oh.  No children?  Well, um, so what do you do for family?  Y- you -- you just consider your adopted family, right?
R:  Oh, yeah.  I was adopted at, um, like, six weeks old.
L:  Oh.  Oh.
R:  But I was with my birth mother for, like, a month 'cause there's a missing month there 'cause I was only in the or- -- um, adoption agency for two weeks --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- until my parents got me.
L:  Oh.  So, maybe she was -- she was still thinking about what she was going to do?
R:  Right.
L:  Oh.  Th- -- well, that must be hard, you know?
R:  That must've destroyed her to have a baby for a month and then not have it any more.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  But they have these, um, registries on the, um -- on the internet now that you can -- you can list everything you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and they can search, you know, by birth date --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and things like that.  And maybe find ... you know?
L:  Well, do they still keep all those records closed?
R:  Yep.
L:  No kidding.  But the -- but if someone -- someone had a health problem and they thought, ah, they needed to, um -- um, contact the real parents or something, wouldn't they allow for that?
R:  Yeah.  They'll do that.
L:  So, it --
R:  But it has to be, you know, really serious.
L:  Oh.  Yeah.  It's a shame.  And then today, I mean, the kids have it hard with the parents both, you know, working and all.  And, um, I guess, ah, a lot of them have to fend for themselves and it's har- -- it's hard for them.  Some of them come very sad families.  Um, I know when my kids went to school they used to come home and tell me about the other kids, um, ah -- ah, being, ah, bad and carrying on.  Well, I said, "Well, a lotta them have things going on at home and they don't know how to express their anger and all, you know, and they take it out on the other kids".
R:  Mm.
L:  Things, you know, like that.
R:  Yeah.  A lot of times it's a cry for help or a cry for attention.
L:  Yeah.  Ah --
R:  When they act up.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, you know, sometimes you're better off when -- when you don't even know your parents, I think.  Because, um, I know I checked my mother's, um -- my real mother's, um, records and -- you know, when I decided to go looking and see what -- what I could find.  And she had been, um -- back then, they put her in some, kind of, psychiatric, ah, place because -- just for own protection.  Like, when she had abandoned us, um, because they said she was, like, wandering the streets.  And I think they didn't have a lot of street people back then.  They mostly took them and put them in, um, the institutions.  You know?  And now they let them loose.
R:  I know it.  They --
L:  But --
R:  They don't have a lot of help from people now.
L:  No.  No.  So, I don't even know whether she's still alive or not.  But I know my foster mother used to carry on because she'd say -- she would say to me, "Oh, if your real mother ever comes back you're gonna go running to her" and all.  And when I was little, I never thought about it.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?  But some -- I -- ah, when you get older, sometimes, you, um -- it plays with your mind.  Have you, um, tried d- -- ah -- it -- ah, more so recently than when you were younger?
R:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  All of a sudden.
L:  Really?
R:  I've -- I've started, you know?
L:  Thinking about it?
R:  Yeah.  Try to figure it out.
L:  Yeah.  I think it has cau- -- ah, has to do with, like, getting older.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, 'cause when you're younger you g- -- you ha- -- you don't have the full concept of it and --
R:  No.  And you're really busy when you're younger, usually.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're y- y- you don't -- you don't have these things weighing on your mind and then as you get older and then you think, "Well, um, maybe I have other brothers and sisters and -- and, um, I'd like to know the whole story".  I think that's the sad part.  You know, there's the questions that are left.
R:  Yep.
L:  I mean, my mother went w- -- ah, what I found out in the records was a year after -- no, it wasn't a year ... yeah, I guess it was about a year after she'd left us, she went and had another kid.
R:  Oh, my god.
L:  Yeah.  So, I have a -- I have a half sister or somebody walking around somewhere.
R:  Do you know her name?
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] you know, I can't think of it.  It was, ah -- it was a very pretty name.  I've got it written down somewhere and, um -- but no.  I can't think of it right now.  And --
R:  Have -- have you tried doing, like, searches on the internet?
L:  Yeah.  I tried searching by, um, my mother's age and all.  You know, because I figured if I could find out her social security number or something.
R:  Right.
L:  I looked in the DSS indexes and I -- I couldn't find too much there.  And, um, then what I was going to do was look for, um, like, my real grandfather.  I know, like, around when he died, I was gonna look and try to see if I could find, um, maybe a will or something of his that would include my mother that maybe would include something of -- of her or an address or something.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, there's a lot of things they tell you s- -- to start with what you know and to use that information.  I was lucky that I found out as much as I did because, um, the records I got hold of were from, um, forty five years ago.
R:  Mm.
L:  But I was able to put my hands on them.  And --
R:  You know, that's pretty amazing.  And usually if they have to put somebody in an institution, it's personal.  It's private.
L:  Yeah.  But see, um, what they tell you is if you have, um, [LIPSMACK] ah -- if you have a good enough reason or something and you contacted the person that -- where the records are stored and I guess if you -- if it's not involving an adoption, th- they'll let you access, um, y- you know, some of the records.
R:  Hm.
L:  And plus you figure, there's a lot of researchers in all the -- you know, they do stuff.  And some of them, I mean, they look -- they -- they do studies on crime and families and -- and [MN] they have to have access to all those, um, records.  So --
R:  Mm.
L:  Um, [PAUSE] they -- they let you -- you -- I guess they can tell who's -- who's not see -- you know, who's just looking to -- to get people's identities or some- --
