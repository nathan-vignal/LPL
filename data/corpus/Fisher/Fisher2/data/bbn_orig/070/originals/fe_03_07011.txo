R:  Hello.  My name is r- Rochelle Kennedy.
L:  Ah, hi.  My name is Phyllis Coutu[?].  How you doing this evening?
R:  Fine.  I believe that computers in education are very beneficial because, currently, I work as a substitute teacher --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and computers are playing a vital role as far as technology and bringing the student up to the forefront of being able to be competitive in the job force.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And when they do leave the school setting, they not only have a trade but they also have the ability to be, ah, at the forefront and, basically, achieving their goals.  And also, it -- it's vital as far as in colleges that they're seeking applications and because most of the colleges are run by -- if they give presentations, they have to have some knowledge of PowerPoint or Microsoft Office software.  So, it ac- actually, to me, it's beneficial.
L:  Um, ma- -- p- -- I agree with you and, ah -- but for -- for some, um, [LIPSMACK] parts, I believe, in a way, it takes away some of the, ah, student's ability to, ah -- ah, think more creatively, you know?  Do you understand what I mean?
R:  Well, and actually, I would e- -- I'm a creative person and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as far as technology --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it has increased my curiosity to --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- learn --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- more.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And to actually find out the in depth of things because as far as the computer --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- itself is so systematic --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that if the student starts learning about it, whether it's in programming or whether it's just in word processing, it's giving them a discipline as far as a structure.  Because in order for you to learn --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- the computer applications or the computer system itself, it takes you through steps in order for you to learn it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, it really doesn't [PAUSE] -- d- depending on the student --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they could possibly give evidence[?] to where they w- want to learn more.  And in actuality, on a computer, most teachers are educators, as I stated, um -- somewhat in the school setting -- r- really encourage them to be -- with different projects that bring in the creativity but all they do is they apply it and they use the creativity in projects and they enhance it by putting it on the system and, basically, working with it and maneuvering with it.  So --
L:  Sounds like it's gr- -- truly great, um -- to be +computer lit- literate --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and know how to use a computer and I just ta- -- I can't think of anything else to say except it's great. [LAUGH]
R:  Well --
L:  Except for the fact that if the children might wanna misuse it after school or whatever or use it the wrong way.  That's -- it's the only concern I might have.  But other than that --
R:  Well, in that case, there's so many programs out there --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- where the parents can actually --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- basically, monitor what their st- -- ah, children are doing after school.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But in the school setting there are guidelines that the students have to use and actually they have to th- -- sign a affidavit that they're gonna comply with it before they even go to the computer labs and they know this.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, there's not too much misuse in the school setting.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And at home, there are so many mechanisms that are in the circle around that --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- the parents can use to -- if they do wanna restrict them in that area they can.
L:  It's gotta be raising the average of the s- -- test scores of the -- of the local, um, [LIPSMACK] high school students, right?  M- -- it being that --
R:  Well, I believe -- well, when I was at -- working at a university, there are all types of software -- there are academic based software.  Like, there's software packages that you can load on to your computer --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that actually teaches you calculus or teaches you about trigonometry.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it gives you that additional edge.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And like I say, there's a lotta educational packets.  If you have a preschooler, there's Reader Rabbit programs or maths programs that you can load and there's software packages you can load on your computer and they can learn the computer at a early age.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, like the Reader Rabbit program, it -- it's something fun for them.  But --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's -- at the same time, they're learning, "Wow, I'm doing this.  I'm looking at something that's fun" but it's just on a computer.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, it's not taking away from their knowledge.  It's giving them something to -- actually, like I said in the beginning, I believe it's enhancing them to where they know this is where the future is headed.
L:  Mm.
R:  In order for you to progress, you're gonna have to know something --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- regarding the computer.  Because mo- most of the jobs that you're gonna find, even at the supermarkets, even at --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a restaurant.
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  They're bringing in computers.
L:  Everywhere.  Yeah.
R:  Even though it's like a cash register setting.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And they -- they're used to scan groceries.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And even -- you can check out yourself but you got to know something about --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- reading the instructions.  And that's what the computer is about.  You have --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to know the instructions in a step by step, m- -- um, process --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in order to, basically, do it.  So, it gives you the thinking.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, in the education realm, in regards to working with computers as far as the classrooms, it's going -- to me, it's going to be beneficial.  And I don't know -- it's not to say I wouldn't like to know -- but I believe it will enhance their education because many of my studies, I had to do presentations and they wanted it to be type written and if I wouldn't have known -- and they wanted it to be word processed -- pretty much was the requirement.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, if I would of never gotten the training in high school, I wouldn't have been prepared to present that paper or the thesis or whatever that -- the professor wanted in the c- classroom.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, it will be needed in college.  When you get outta college, most of the jobs now are having presentations.  If they go and become a corporate trainer, most of the corporate presentations -- and they circle around based on you learning the computer and the software packages.
L:  Mm.
R:  Especially, mi- -- I believe, Microsoft Office is what's going --
L:  It's, um, m- m- most greatly --
R:  Ah, the presentations --
L:  Most greatly needed.  Especially if you're gonna study medicine and, um, [LIPSMACK] research and all of this and that.  So, extremely helpful for medicine, you know?
R:  And I had a friend that was in the hospital line -- I have a lot of friends.
L:  Mm.
R:  But the thing about it is, a lot of the hospital equipment is now becoming computerized so --
L:  Mm.  Yeah.
R:  -- you have to know something about the computers.
L:  Also, is there that, like new robot?  I don't know -- new robot in the surgery room, right?  So --
R:  Yes.  And also, I believe, some of the equipment, like, the CAT scans and all of that is.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And the x-ray machines are trying to be upgraded to where it's, somewhat, computerized --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and easy to function.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, there's a lot of things where they're trying to bring in the computer facet because, one, it's efficient --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- two, it gives, somewhat, better results and neater results in the end.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it's systematic.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But it's for the individual instructor to keep the creativity in it and that part t- -- hopefully, is not gonna be taken away because there are computer projects to -- where the teacher wants them to bring in projects that -- that they create as far as they can bring in brochures that they're creating their own business and they want to advertise it through a brochure or a flyer.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's where the teacher has to be creative.
L:  Um, m- may I ask what, ah, class you teach?
R:  Most of my classes, ah, at this point, have been geared towards mathematics.
L:  Ah, mathematics.  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  So -- but the thing about it is, I know that, for a fact, a lot of the counting processes are, basically, going to the computer and I wouldn't believe -- and as technology advances in all the districts --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, I believe that we're gonna see more and more of maths homework online to where the students can pull it from home and they have to --
L:  They can -- they -- they can get the help they need if they have a problem on the computer, right?
R:  Right.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because a lot of the universities have already set up sites to where they have a online tutorial that the students can go to --
L:  That's great.
R:  -- to see answers.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I just think of it as the computer is not your enemy.  It's --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- not -- and it -- most of all, you have to think of it as it's needed in the classroom but it doesn't take away the human factor.
