L:  Hi.  My name's Jennifer. [PAUSE] Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  My name's Jennifer.
R:  Oh, hi Jennifer.  This is Sherry Gordon.  I've never done this before.
L:  Oh, that's okay.  I've actually never done it either. [LAUGH]
R:  What's that?
L:  I've never done it neither.
R:  You haven't done it neither?
L:  No.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Where are you calling from?
R:  Minnesota.
L:  I'm calling from Boston.
R:  Okay.
L:  Never been to Minnesota.
R:  Well, it's a -- actually, I'm in Wisconsin.  I don't know why I s- said Minnesota.  Probably, 'cause I just moved from there about three --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- months ago.  So --
L:  Okay.  Um, so, what do you think about computers in education?
R:  About -- I'm sorry, my phone does sound really bad and I just bought a new one but I couldn't hear you very well.
L:  Oh.  What do you think about computers in education?
R:  Computers in education?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is that what your topic is?
L:  Yeah.  What was your topic?
R:  Um, f- fam- family.  What does the word family mean to me?
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I guess we can talk about that. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] It doesn't matter.
L:  It --
R:  I would probably be able to talk more about family than computers in education.
L:  Okay.  Well, what does the word family mean [LAUGH] to you? 
R:  [LAUGH] Um, it's, um [PAUSE] -- the family -- family means to me, ah, probably what i- -- ah, something very different than what most people think it means and, to me, a family is -- is pe- -- people who choose to be one -- with one another to, um -- in order to help each other members grow rather -- and that biological families aren't usually as good as y- -- people that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they +gravitate towards.
L:  Yeah.  I know.  I would agree with you about the biological families.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, you know, I think a lot of people feel that way.  It's just not how they would typically define it unless they really sat down to think about it.
R:  It e- -- it's -- because I'm in the Mid West but families are pretty, ah, strong here and people --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- tend to stay loyal to their families regardless of the dysfunction that might be in them.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Well, not in my family.  I mean, actually I originally grew up in Olympia, Washington.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And so, yeah, over there, families are a huge, huge, huge deal.
R:  Are they?
L:  Um, but I went to school in Boston, Massachusetts --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I'm -- stayed there after I graduated, which was just last night.  And maybe --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- just because the education here or education's such a large part of -- of the community here and everyone is really in our twenties --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that no one talks about family.  Family alliances aren't nearly as strong.
R:  Right.
L:  But -- but yeah.  I would agree with you.  I think there's huge differen- -- um, geographical differences as -- as to why [several inaudible words].
R:  Do you think that f- -- people are -- families are changing because of geographical changes now?
L:  Because it's so much easier to move?  Yeah, I think that makes a difference.
R:  That we're so much more mobile?
L:  Yeah.  I'm -- I'm sure that makes a difference.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't see how it couldn't.  But, um, I don't know.  What else affects it?
R:  Well, I grew up in California -- in, um, Northern California in the s- seventies and eighties.
L:  North of San Francisco or ...?
R:  Sorry?
L:  North of San Francisco?
R:  Just south.
L:  Okay.
R:  In Palo Alto.
L:  Oh, I used to live in San Jose.
R:  In where?
L:  San Jose.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Cool.
L:  Yeah.  Close by.
R:  Well, my family's all still there in -- all around Palo Alto and my family is, like, the perfect California of the time family where --
L:  [LAUGH] Really?
R:  -- none of my relatives are actually biologically [LAUGH] related to me.
L:  Oh.
R:  Even though I had my natural parents growing up --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- my, ah -- I have step parents and half sisters and, you know, my ninety five year old grandmother was actually my mother's stepmother.
L:  Really?
R:  Um, it's really a blend.  And even after I moved here when I was twenty, my parents got divorced and so, as an adult, I got a whole new set of [LAUGH] families.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  I think --
R:  And we're all really, really close but --
L:  Ah, that's really cool that you guys are close.
R:  Oh, yeah.  It's very cool.
L:  I think that happens a lot though.  My family's a typical nuclear family but my parents just happen to be strange.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I'm [LAUGH] not as close to my parents as most of my other friends are who don't have a nuclear family.
R:  Well, I didn't meet people who had m- -- originally married parents, you know, until I moved to the Mid West.  Honestly.
L:  Really?
R:  Oh, yeah.  Everybody I knew had a stepparent.
L:  Wow.
R:  Or a single parent.  But I -- I think the first time I m- met someone and they invited me out to their family's house, I said, "Is it your moms or your dads?" [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And they were s- -- like --
L:  What?
R:  -- ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- "They both live there and they've -- they're both been together". [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I was like, "No way". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's funny.
R:  It's really common.
L:  Huh.
R:  And I -- it's not common at all where I -- when I go home.  It's a totally different --
L:  Huh. Yeah, no.  That's interesting.  I guess, I mean, but -- huh.  Well, the other thing is I found that most people who have parents who are divorced have friends who have parents who are divorced.  Whereas, most -- most people who have, ah, parents who are still married have friends wh- -- with parents that are still married.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, maybe it's not so much geographical differences but the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a different in the subset of the population who I hang out with now as opposed to when I was growing up.  That makes me think changes in family are different based on geographical differences.
R:  Right.  I totally agree with that.  I think there's so many different elements it's hard to say --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, d- -- ah, it could be if the people come from two different cultures or what if it's a bi racial marriage?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, what if it's an older, younger?  What if it's gay or lesbian?  I mean, I don't know.  Do you think it's good that there are so many options now available to people?
L:  Well, yeah.  Definitely.
R:  You think it's healthy?
L:  Because if there wasn't so many peop- -- if there weren't so many options available, some people would just be left out.  They wouldn't have any options at all.
R:  Right.
L:  And I think it's definitely better to have options than to not.  Um, but do you mean as far as --
R:  Well, do you think, like -- for instance, do you think that marriage is a viable institution? It's a worthwhile thing for gays and lesbians to try and, um, get the ri- right to have?
L:  I think so.  But see, I don't know.  I'm, kind of, conservative of that.  I think that the right is not so much an a- -- like, emotionally, I have the right for everyone to respect my relationship and see that it's sanctified.  Ah --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to that there I'd -- they deserve the same, sort of, benefits as a normal nuclear family would or a normal married family.
R:  I think you're gonna have to repeat it again.  My phone's being really lousy.
L:  Oh, okay.  Sorry.
R:  Sorry. [LAUGH] 
L:  To me, I think the biggest reason for gay marriages to be legalized is so that people in those sorts of relationships can have the same health insurance, social security benefits that people in other, um, heterosexual relationships have.
R:  Right.
L:  Although, I can see how if I was gay or a lesbian I would likely see it from a different perspective.
R:  Right.
L:  But to me, I don't know.  Marriage, to me, isn't really a huge deal.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I think that if you're in a long term, loving relationship, it's not really that much different.  I actually got into a huge argument with my mother 'cause I live with my boyfriend and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- she thinks it's sin.  And, I'm like, "Well, it's not really any different than what you do".
R:  Yeah.
L:  "We [LAUGH] care about each other the same way that you -- that you care about my dad".
R:  Right.
L:  But, yeah.  The [NOISE] only reason I see that is having a benefit is for legal reasons.
R:  Well, I'm forty two and I've never been married and I haven't had kids and I don't think I will but, you know, I'm engaged now for the first time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And my boyfriend and I l- -- bought a house together and --
L:  That's exciting.
R:  Pardon?
L:  That's exciting.
R:  Yeah.  It is.  You know, but for someone like me who's been really independent all my life, it's -- seems really pointless to get married.  I don't really -- I mean, it'll be cool to have my family and his family have a party together.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's, kind of, what I talked about with my boyfriend.  We're like, "Well, marriage is a good idea 'cause then we can get some kegs and celebrate on the beach and have everyone we know over". [LAUGH]
R:  Totally.  That's exactly --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- what we're gonna do is --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- since we bought a farm, I'm gonna have -- you know, we wanted that -- just have a big party out on the farm where everyone could, you know, dance and --
L:  And celebrate and --
R:  -- stay all weekend if they wanted to and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, at the same time, how -- what -- why do it legally?  Does it -- I mean, I'm really curious about if a -- making a pledge in front of a whole bunch of people will make our marriage last --
L:  Or feel different --
R:  -- rather than --
L:  -- than it does right now?
R:  Pardon?
L:  Do you think it'll make you feel different than you do now about your relationship --
R:  I don't --
L:  -- and the longevity and ...?
R:  I don't think it will 'cause I'm totally -- I'm -- I respect him.  He's the one I want for the rest of my life.  And I -- he's been married before so s- -- he's a little more gun shy but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I don't know.  I've never done anything for my whole life so how would I know?  But --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I just don't think it makes any difference.
L:  Yeah.  You know, I don't really either.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And maybe that's why the whole idea of family has changed so much is because lots of people think the same way that we do.
R:  Yeah.  I think that's true.  I mean, but you'd be surprised.  The wedding industry is really booming here.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  I don't know if it's out there but, yeah, they have a --
L:  I don't really pay attention to that, sort of, stuff.  Even though lots of my friends are getting engaged and tying the knot.  I'm like, "Oh, all right".  That's --
R:  N- no one was when I was growing up.  No one wanted to get married.  Everyone wanted to go to Stanford or, you know, get on to college.  It was considered, sort of, lowbrow to get married.  But --
L:  Oh, yeah.  Well, m- my friends are -- th- they're mostly -- they're all out of college.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They've done that whole thing but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's --
R:  Oh, that's -- that might be a little different.  But, you know, none of my -- my friends all wanted to be artists or musicians or academics.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] So -- but in Minnesota, people get married in high school or right outta high school.
L:  Yeah.  My sister's getting married this fall --
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- and she's -- well, she still lives at home.  She never left Olympia.
R:  Wow.
L:  And she's eighteen.
R:  Whoa.
L:  So, and if religious -- well, my community is really religious and I think that that affects how early people get married as well.
R:  Definitely.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it is much more religious in the Mid West and I'm not religious.  So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I still think that my -- my m- -- I don't know.  I just have these larger questions on my mind about why do two people even have to do what they're gonna -- you know, do two people need to match up for their entire lives even if they're not gonna have children?  What's the benefit of that?  Is that natural state of affairs --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- or is that social or just ...?
L:  Yeah.  I --
