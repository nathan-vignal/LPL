L:  Hi.  I'm Mary Elle.
R:  Hi.  I'm sorry, I didn't hear that. [LAUGH]
L:  Mary Elle.  How you doing?
R:  Mary Elle?  Hi.  My name's Camille.
L:  Hi.  That's a pretty name.
R:  Oh, thanks.  So, is Mary Elle. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, what is the topic of today?
R:  I think she said, "What is the meaning of -- what does family to us?"
L:  Oh.  Um --
R:  Go ahead.  You can go first. [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, [LAUGH] no. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I was gonna let you do that first.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, I guess it's people who you live with or, ah, who, you know, you care about.  And not necessarily, like, blood relative or anything like that but just people that you care about and have gone through all of the stuff with you.  Um, I can't really think of anything right now.
R:  No.  That's --
L:  So --
R:  -- exactly what I was thinking.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  People that -- yep.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  People that you live with, people that you spend a lot of time with.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Usually, that you are related to you by blood.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  Well, are generally related to --
R:  Right.  You bet.
L:  -- by blood but, like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I don't live, like, in the same state as my family anymore so --
R:  Oh, no. [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, you have to, kinda like, create your own --
R:  Create your own family.
L:  -- family too.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  But -- yeah.  Um, I don't know.  I mean, like I live in Pittsburgh now and my p- -- my entire family's mostly in New York or outta the country.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So, I don't get to see them much.  How about yours?
R:  Um, no.  I live, like, right around the corner from my mother --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- and most of my family.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]  So, we're all very -- very close. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, it's not like we are not close or anything like that.
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, like, I miss 'em but -- but, um -- yeah.  I d- --
R:  Do you have family of your own?
L:  I have family of my own I just don't get to see them all that much and, you know, it's just, kinda, the distance thing is a pain.
R:  Right.
L:  And --
R:  But there's so many -- I mean, especially -- well, with the computer, you know, it's easy to email and -- you know?
L:  Well, no.  Well, my m- -- my mom, mostly, she's just not very computer --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- savvy --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and she's like, "What is this thing?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But -- yeah.
R:  That's where the cellphone comes in handy. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Every once in a while I get a call from her, "This is your mother --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- just making sure you're eating right".
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  That's -- that's always a big issue.  But -- yeah.  Well, how'd, like -- how do you manage, just like, n- -- d- -- which -- which town do you live?
R:  Which what?
L:  Which town do you live in?  Like, your entire family lives on the same block?
R:  Um, no.  We're all, um, located in, um -- I live in the town of Bridgewater, Massachusetts.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And like I said, my mother's right around the corner from me.  I have a brother that lives, like, five minutes away.  My sister lives in the next town over, which is --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- like, fifteen minutes away.  Um, I have another brother -- well, two other brothers live in, like, the other town over.  So --
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  So --
L:  I have, ah, never had that.  I mean, like, except for when I was much younger and -- but I -- but I -- even live in the country so -- it's just towns are a lot smaller and --
R:  I don't even know if I could [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, I'm thirty eight years old so I don't even know if I could pack up and move away now. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, no.  I pretty much just, like -- I was living in New York and New York is not the place to be at right now.
R:  No. [LAUGH]
L:  So, I just, kinda --
R:  Unfortunately not. [LAUGH]
L:  No.  It really isn't.  I miss it but it's just, um, not the place to be in right now.  And --
R:  Well, you said that family is where, you know, it's -- it's --
L:  Family is where the heart is too.
R:  -- how you hold people in your heart.  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, a p- -- pretty nice family over here too.  So, you know, it's not all lost.
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Then you're very lucky. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, yeah.  I -- I feel very lucky.  But -- yeah.
R:  Now, how many phone calls have you had?
L:  Oh, I've had, um, only, like, two or three or something like that.
R:  I think there's o- -- you can only do three.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think, like, my roommate has done a couple too so --
R:  Oh, good.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE] And now the --
R:  So, this is my third one.
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  This is my third call.
L:  Oh, good.  And, like, what happens after that?
R:  I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I hope there's something after. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  'Cause I figured, like, they just keep calling and the other day they called and it was, like, race relations or --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- ah, something --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- odd and it was just, like, "I have no idea --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- what are they talking about?"  I won't pick it up.  Okay.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, they called one night --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and it was, um, after eleven. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I --
L:  After eleven?
R:  I was just, kind of -- I was like -- yeah.  And -- and I'm sitting I'm going r- -- like, did I r- -- you know, check that off when I checked it off on the computer?  And I'm -- I was, like, "I'm just too tired to -- to [LAUGH] have a --"
L:  Exactly.
R:  "-- conversation with anyone".
L:  Well --
R:  So --
L:  -- they call every time and I think --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- they call around here, like, at, ah ... what time is it now?  Like, three or four?  No, it's --
R:  Oh, it's -- oh, it's seven o'clock here.
L:  It's, kinda --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  late in the -- yeah.  Oh, never mind.  It is seven o'clock.  I didn't r- --
R:  The -- oh -- oh, all right. [LAUGH] I was just gonna say, you're in a different time zone? [LAUGH]
L:  No.  [LAUGH] No.  No.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No.  They totally, just, generally --
R:  B- --
L:  -- call, like, around three or really early in the morning.  I'm just, like, "What is it?"
R:  Oh, no.
L:  "What do you want?"
R:  You're too early. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But -- yeah.  It's really weird.  I -- I guess I'm wondering, like, what's gonna happen after this thing is done.  Huh. [SIGH].
R:  Yeah.  Me too. [LAUGH] I guess I d- -- I hope there's something else. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  I just don't want it to end.
L:  Well, they probably just, like, mail you something, like, another survey or something, like, "How did you like this survey?"
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Like, "It was good.  Give -- g- -- send us more". [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But -- yeah.  My friend told me about it and, apparently, he's done it a couple a times but I don't know what happens afterwards.  I have to ask him about that.
R:  Well, I guess we'll be guinea pigs then and we'll [LAUGH] find --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- out. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  That's -- you know?  You make a buck somehow.
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.  And --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- every little bit helps. 
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.  But -- yeah.  Um, I guess -- what happens after this?
R:  After we're done talking?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, they usually, um, will butt in and say, like, "Your ten minutes are up.  Say goodbye". [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  Okay.  Well [LAUGH]
R:  So [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] That's really odd.  I wonder what they're, like, measuring for?  Like, what are they surveying for?
R:  I really don't know [LAUGH] what the study -- you know, what they're actually looking for.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's -- I don't know.  Obviously, just two people, you know, from different places --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- talking about -- I don't know.  Just --
L:  About pizza or --
R:  About pizza. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We could talk about pizza. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I -- yeah.  I like pizza.
R:  I like pizza.  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  W- -- th- -- well, I'm just learning how to bake right now.
R:  Oh, you were --
L:  They caught me in the middle of learning so [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, no. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I hope I don't burn something.  But --
R:  And -- so, when did you -- when I make pizza --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I just buy the, um -- the frozen bread dough --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- in the grocery store --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I -- I thaw it out and that's what I use as my base for my pizza.
L:  I just, like, really wanna learn how to make bread pretty much.
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] --
L:  'Cause I love fresh bread.  I'm not up early enough to go get some --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so, I might as well make it myself.
R:  Do you have a bread machine?
L:  No.  I --
R:  No?
L:  -- b- -- [LAUGH] I try it by hand. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm hardcore like that.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, good for you.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I'm very excited.  I'm just, like, learning how to do that now and -- I don't know.  I -- gonna do it by hand and see how it turns out.
R:  I'm sure it will be delicious. [LAUGH]
L:  I hope so too. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But -- yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  So, what else do you cook -- have you learned to cook?
L:  Oh, I g- -- well, I'm just learning how to bake.  I cook all kinds of stuff.
R:  Oh.
L:  But -- yeah.  Mostly, um, large meat dishes, pretty much.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And --
R:  I -- I use my crock pot a lot.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I -- I have one.  I haven't used it in a while though.
R:  Well, I hadn't used it in a while and then, um, I started working during the day --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I needed something for supper when I got home. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, um, I had all these people at work say, "Oh, you know, you can use it for this and that".
L:  Yeah.
R:  And now, I'm constantly -- in the morning, you throw your meat in, your vegetables --
L:  Exactly.  And just leave it for the whole day.
R:  Yeah.  And, you know, I'm not afraid of burning anything and usually, the meat -- when I cook chicken --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the meat it -- it, like, falls off the bone.  It's delicious.
L:  Exactly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  My grandmother used to, like -- when she cooked it, like, conventionally, it would take forever for it to, like --
R:  I know.  It's [LAUGH] --
L:  -- make really delicious soup but it would take, like, a --
R:  It would take fore- --
L:  -- whole day to make it.
R:  Yeah.  Exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well, crock pots are excellent for that but I -- yeah.  Now that mention it, I haven't used it in a really long time and I --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- should probably --
R:  Dust it off. [LAUGH]
L:  -- look at some recipes and work it out.  But -- yeah.  I love to cook mostly.  But the only thing I haven't really tried was baking 'cause it just looks, kinda, complicated and since cooking, you don't really have to measure things that often --
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  -- you, kinda, just go with your taste and --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- and it's a lot more fun.  But baking, apparently, is, um -- it's a science and I have to measure stuff and I'm having a hard time with that. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] A pinch of this, a pinch of that. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  And it's, like -- I'm, like, you can't really taste it and you can't really check that -- if it's doing okay and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's just, like, it's start finish, that's it.  But --
R:  When, um, my mother first c- -- I'm Italian and my mother --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- made me the recipe for how she made home made macaroni.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, this -- she said, well, "You just put some flour in the bowl and make a ho- -- you know, a well" and I was, like, "What do you mean flour?  How much?" [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Exactly.
R:  I'm -- well, you know, "You just look at it".  I was, like, "I can't look at it". [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  My best friend's grandmother makes the best, most amazing mustard and I asked her how she made it -- it's, like, honey mustard --
R:  Oh.
L:  And I +asked her, "How do you make it?"  And she's just, like, "Oh, I just mix it until it looks right".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I'm, like, "I don't know".
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I'm, like, "I don't know when it looks right.  I don't know if it needs this.  I don't know if it needs that".  H- -- it's really odd.  But, um, apparently, um, she just does all the cooking and none of her daughters learned how to cook from her because she just, kinda like, mixed things 'til they look right.  But everything's so delicious.  And --
R:  Th- -- I know.  And it probably comes out right every single time too. [LAUGH]
L:  It comes out right every single time.  I -- I've had -- eaten at her house and every time I eat at her house I'm just, like, in love and I, like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- wanna move in and, like, live under her kitchen counter or something.
R:  Now see, she's like your family.  You're learning [LAUGH] --
L:  Ex- -- [LAUGH] -actly.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  It's a big family thing.
R:  Yeah.  Y- -- [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  It's a good thing also 'cause I don't get to see my grandmother either all that much.  She lives in the Dominican Republican and I don't get to see --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- her all that much.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  So, she's, kinda, far and I don't get to cook for her or cook with her all that much.  But -- yeah.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Have you been to visit her?
L:  Um, no not --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- not in a really long time.  I haven't been able to since, like, nineteen ninety seven when I was much, much younger.  But --
