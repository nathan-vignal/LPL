R:  Hi.  My name is Diana.
L:  Hi.  My name's Monica.
R:  I'm sorry.  I didn't hear you.
L:  My name is Monica.
R:  Monica?  How you doing Monica?
L:  I'm doing all right.
R:  Ah, have you done one of these before?
L:  No, I haven't.
R:  Oh, this -- this is only my second one too. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, um, I guess we're supposed to talk about what --
L:  Family means to us?
R:  -- family means?  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Um, [PAUSE] hm. [PAUSE]
R:  I guess it can --
L:  Well, I was --
R:  Go ahead. [LAUGH]
L:  Um, I grew up in a military family so, ah, one of the things that sticks to me --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is that families --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- pretty much --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  --  the one concept that you have.  So, it's, ah -- means a lot I guess. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  A- --
R:  I think so too.  Um, I grew up with -- I was the oldest of six kids and I grew up with, um, three sisters and two brothers.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, we were always very close and they're, like, my closest friends now.  And I mean, I have friends too which are like family to me.  As a matter of fact, we've, like, adopted, ah, one of my daughter's friends into the family.  My -- my brother has decided that, you know, this is my son I never had, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, you know, we've picked up people like that too and, um ...  So, family can mean, you know, more than just immediate blood relatives.  You know, it's just someone, I feel, that you're really, really close to that -- that feels like family.  You know --
L:  I- --
R:  -- you feel like they've always been a part of your life and always will be a part of your life.
L:  I think it's those that also have a really big affect on you.  So, like, people that you get really close to that become like family.
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yes.  And, um, we recently -- my husband and I, um, a couple of years ago, started going to church again and the people at church have become our family too.  You know, it's -- it's a small -- very small congregation so it's a very close knit group and that has been, ah, really great for us too.  You know, just -- just having that feeling --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of, ah, closeness with them.  You know, it's that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like minded individual thing I think. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  And it -- that's been really great. [PAUSE]
L:  Yes.
R:  Do you have children of your own?
L:  No.  I'm, [LAUGH] kind of, a kid myself.  I'm -- 
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  -- just really funny. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You -- you didn't sound very old. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm a grandmother so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Ah. [LAUGH]
R:  And, ah, I have two daughters and they're just wonderful.  And it wasn't always that way 'cause that -- that teenage years thing, you know, that was -- that was a treat. [LAUGH] B- -- [LAUGH] but --
L:  It's so funny how true that is. [LAUGH]
R:  Huh?
L:  Like, i- it's just funny that that whole, like, teen -- like, how your kids become foreign to you, how it's true.  Everybody goes through one of those even if it's, like, a little bit after the fact.
R:  Yeah.  And now I've got -- my oldest daughter has two children of her own and one -- one granddaughter lives here, um, locally with me and the other one's in Tennessee with her mother.  Um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  My oldest granddaughter lives with her dad and I get to see her all the time and that's, you know -- that's very special for me 'cause I was always very close with, um, my one grandmother who lived near to us and now I'm hoping that I can have that, kind of, relationship with my granddaughter.  And it's really funny because even though I -- pretty much, I only see the other granddaughter once a year, ah, we talk on the phone -- even though she's only three [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and, um, there's still a closeness n- -- there and I -- I don't know if that's because she is family or what, you know?  I -- it's -- it's -- it's, kind of, strange.  It's hard -- it's hard to explain.
L:  Extended family is, kind of, a different story for me.  Because since my family always moved around -- um, my relatives, like, always lived in LA.  So, I never really got to know them.  I think that's where the -- the friends' thing comes more into play. [PAUSE] Yeah.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  It's -- it's interesting.  A friend of mine who's, um, really close to his relatives -- like, his grandmother is almost more important to him than his mother --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know?  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I've never had that.  Ah, yeah. [PAUSE]
R:  Wow.  Yeah.  Mine --
L:  I don't know what that says about family. [LAUGH]
R:  Huh?
L:  I don't know what that says about family.
R:  [LAUGH] Um, I'm having a little problem hearing 'cause I'm at work and I'm in a room that's got a lotta machinery in the background. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So -- so, just -- just in case I sound a little weird, that's why.
L:  Oh.  No, you sound fine.
R:  Um, yeah.  I've -- I'm -- when I was growing up I was always pretty close to my brother too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, we -- we used to fight like cats and dogs.  My -- he's, um, a year and a half younger than I am and when we were -- like, up until about eleven and twelve, you know, he -- we fought a lot.  But then when we both became teenagers, we started getting really close and he was, ah -- he was really helpful to me when I first left home because I got into a marriage that wasn't the best [LAUGH] and, ah, you know, I was able to turn to him for a lot of support and help him and his wife when he got married as well because she became my -- one of my best friends as well.
L:  That's really cool.
R:  And, um -- so, you know, that's -- it's really great that we've gotten so close because y- -- when my -- my own daughters were growing up, um, they're like night and day and they fought constantly as well.  And now that they're twenty eight and -- well, twenty seven and twenty three, um, they're starting to get closer together and I think that's really good because they've only got each other.  You know, I've got -- like I said, I was the oldest of six, so I've got all those brothers and sisters still around with their families.  And, um, my two daughters really only have one another.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I -- it really makes me feel good to see that they're beginning to form a more close relationship.
L:  So, there are six kids in -- in your family?  You have five siblings then?
R:  Pardon me?
L:  You were saying you have five siblings then?
R:  Yeah.  I've got three sisters and two brothers.
L:  Wow.  And do you feel like you were able to be close with all of them?
R:  Pretty much.  I have -- one of my sisters lives in Tennessee and we talk on the phone and w- -- usually for about a couple of hours at a time. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And, um, the rest of them live here locally.  My -- I have one sister who lives here [NOISE] in the city where I work and my home is, like, twenty miles away.  And the rest of my brothers and sisters live there in Carthage.  So, um, I'm able to see them quite a bit.  I go for walks every day with my one sister.  She's, ah, ten years younger than me but she's always been my favorite.  You know, she's -- we shared a room when we were kids and, um -- of course, I think she's the whole family's favorite but [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- she -- she's my favorite too. [LAUGH] Yeah.  And so, it's really great that I'm able to be really close to her.  When she had her first daughter, [LIPSMACK] um, the father wasn't anywhere around.  He wanted nothing to do with the kid so she came home -- she had lived in Florida when she got pregnant -- and she came home and, um, I was able to go in the delivery room when she had the baby and I -- I actually was the first one that got to hold my niece.  So, that was very special, you know, that she let me go in there with her and -- and be there for that.
L:  That sounds very special
R:  It really was.  And -- and now, my niece is -- is, ah, very close with me as well.  So, it's -- you know, a family -- 'cause that's the whole thing, I guess.  You know, family can be so much.  I mean, it's -- it's almost like it's more than family.  At -- at least, for us.  I -- you know, I'm -- I realize that not everyone is like that.  My first husband's family was not like that at all.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, I know that we were very lucky to have this, kind of, a relationship.  But --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like -- like I said earlier, you know, they're not just my family, they're my friends too.  And I know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- not everybody feels that way about their families.
L:  Yeah.  My, ah -- I have an older brother who's got a daughter that's about seven now and I'm trying to establish that, you know, connection that I didn't feel I had with my, ah -- my relatives.  Because it's always nice to have m- more people that you can turn to, you know?
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  Yeah.
R:  U- um, that's really great that you're doing that and reaching out to her.  I'm sure that she's gonna really appreciate that.
L:  Yeah.  It's -- ah, they came and visited the other day and she asked us to be pen pals.  It's really neat coming from -- from your niece, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's --
R:  It is.
L:  It's interesting.
R:  It is.  Um, my oldest granddaughter is seven right now and, [LIPSMACK] um, like I said, she's living with her dad but she's got so much extended family because she's got, um, our side of the family, you know, her mom's side of the family and there's quite a bit of us here locally, like I said.  And then she's got her dad's side of the family and, um, his parents got divorced quite a few years ago so she's got --
