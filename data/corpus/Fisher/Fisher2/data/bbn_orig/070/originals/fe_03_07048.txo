L:  You're f- -- you're not f- -- very far from north eastern Colorado.
R:  Um, I'm not sure how far it is. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It's far enough depending --
R:  I- --
L:  -- on where you are in Texas.
R:  I'm in --
L:  I guess we're supposed to talk about our family, huh?
R:  Yes.  This is only my second call so I'm -- and my first call was a long time ago so I'm, ah [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] I kept turning 'em down because they weren't subjects I want to talk. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, well, they -- when they called me I was, like, um -- like, one time I was in the doctor's office --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I couldn't do it and then --
L:  I got hit in the library. [LAUGH]
R:  Sometimes I leave my phone in the car and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'd come back out and I'd see it and I'd say, "Dang". [LAUGH]
L:  You missed it. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So --
L:  Y- -- do you have any kids?
R:  Yes.  I have, ah, two kids.  I have --

R:  Oh.  So, you gr- --
L:  And I'm a grandma. [LAUGH]
R:  I thought I waited a long time in between my kids --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but you really waited a long time. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  I really did wait [LAUGH] a long time.
R:  And it's different -- so different from one to the other. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yes.  That it is.
R:  Yep.  And I have custody of my thirteen year old niece so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I have three.  Yeah.
L:  So, you actually have three kids.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But everybody looks at me when I say I h- -- when I say I have a thirteen year old, they're, like, very --
L:  Okay, when did you start? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.
L:  Ah.
R:  But, um --
L:  Yeah.  I have a grandson and a granddaughter.  They're one year apart. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, goodness.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Sh- -- my daughter in law wasn't ready for that one but --
R:  I understand the feeling. [LAUGH]
L:  So, are you married?
R:  Yeah.  I'm married.  I have --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- a husband.  I've been married, ah, nine years.
L:  Nine years?
R:  Nine years.  Yeah.
L:  Well, I don't know.  I can't count the years and my guess[?] is seventy nine so [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh.
L:  Too many --
R:  So --
L:  -- years to count.
R:  Ah, seventy nine?  Well, let's see?  I was born se- -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- twenty four years. [inaudible] --
L:  That's too many years to count. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  And now --
R:  So, were y- --
L:  -- we finally decide to have a kid.
R:  Yeah.  Exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  She's -- most of the time, she's my angel.
R:  Yeah.  They are.
L:  She's just so -- she -- well, she'll be four in August.
R:  Oh, that's a nice --
L:  So, we're really hitting the independent stage. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  My, ah -- my children, I'm telling you, there's nothing more precious than your children.
L:  No.  Yeah -- at times, like, "Get away from me" but other times you can't have 'em close enough, right?
R:  Exactly.
L:  She's s- --
R:  There are times when you need your time alone --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- but there are times when you want 'em with you. [LAUGH] I --
L:  Well --
R:  -- mine are spoiled rotten.
L:  Mine gave up her nap a long time ago.
R:  W- well, mine's taking a nap right now. Thank goodness. [LAUGH]
L:  I wish mine would.
R:  [LAUGH] And the other one's at my --
L:  I can get some --
R:  The other one's at my friend's house swimming. [LAUGH]
L:  Ah.  My daughter starts swimming lessons th- -- next week.
R:  Oh.  That ought a be fun.  My children --
L:  Well, it's to- -- it's a toddlers' session.
R:  Yeah.  My --
L:  So, it won't be too much.
R:  My children love to swim.
L:  Well, see, I live in a Podunk town.  I'm in the middle of nowhere.  My town's population is two hundred and fifty.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I thought I lived in a small town.  We have twelve thousand. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  Well, I live near Sterling, which is up the north east corner of Colorado --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- near Nebraska.  That's where I'm in.  I'm out there in the middle of nowhere.  Out there among the farmers. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, we -- we're -- we live a couple of miles from town but, you know, it only take a few minutes to get there and --
L:  Yeah.  I'm about twelve miles from Sterling.
R:  I thought we really had a small town here.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Twelve thousand, you know?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  There's the skating rink and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- um, we have the movies.
L:  Oh, we've got a post office and we've got a grade school and high school.  That's it.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, what -- when you want to do something with your kids where do you take 'em?
L:  Hop in to town into Sterling or you head off into Denver, which is about a hundred and fifty miles.
R:  Oh, my goodness.  That's a drive.
L:  So, yeah.  It's a drive.
R:  And it -- oh, I'd be terri- -- on -- we went --
L:  I actually take -- take her to the zoo, we go up to Nebraska.
R:  We went to, ah --
L:  There's a little zoo up in Nebraska.
R:  -- Dallas.  Have you ever heard of Dallas?
L:  Yeah.  I've been through Dallas.
R:  We went to Dallas to Six Flags last week and took the kids and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- they were -- we had a ball.  We had a good, well, family vacation.  Forgot --
L:  Mm.  I can't 'til my daughter gets old enough to go to amusement parks. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.
L:  I need a partner for the roller coasters. [LAUGH]
R:  It was so much fun.  We all had fun.
L:  Mm.
R:  And we g- -- we went on a cool day and --
L:  Per- --
R:  -- the kids did- -- they didn't fight.  I mean, they rode in the car great.
L:  Ah.
R:  It was wonderful.
L:  So, how's your weather?
R:  I got lost a couple a times but ... [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I've already taught my daughter her name, her phone number, her address, her mommy and daddy's name.  So, if --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- we ever lose her, she'll be able to tell the people where she belongs. [LAUGH]
R:  That's -- that's good.  My -- my little boy, um, his teacher was impressed when he went to kindergarten.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Me and my husband, we always sit down and work with the kids and we -- they do work with us during the summer and read and my little boy, when he went to pre K, he knew his address and phone number, [LAUGH] you know, everything. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, my daughter's not even four years old and she knows all that.
R:  And he c- -- he could tell them -- he could tell them my cellphone number, my husband's cellphone number --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So, he -- he was ready and she was, like, "Most of the pre K kids that come here, they don't, you know -- they don't know anything.  We have to teach 'em". [LAUGH]
L:  Well, see like --
R:  She said, "He was so easy". [LAUGH]
L:  My daughter gets ripped at school 'cause she actually doesn't get to start kindergarten until she's six.
R:  Oh.
L:  'Cause up here, the cutoff date is in May.
R:  In May?
L:  Yeah.  In May.
R:  Ours is September down here.
L:  I'm like, "Come on.  Get with civilization here" but there's no way to fight it.  So, I says --
R:  Well, doesn't --
L:  -- well, "Then she spends three years in preschool".
R:  I just thought everybody done it in September.
L:  No.
R:  Huh.  That's cr- --
L:  Now, right up here they cut -- the cutoff's in May.
R:  That's crazy.
L:  So, she's gonna -- she -- her birthday's August nineteen -- she's gonna be six years old when she starts kindergarten.
R:  Oh.  She's gonna be old -- the oldest -- you know, one of the older kids in the class.
L:  I'll be fighting to have her pushed ahead. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, also, I've got a very big little girl.
R:  Oh.
L:  She wears size six.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  Now, you're thinking, "Must be a fat little girl" right?  She's forty two inches tall and forty two pounds.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  So, she is not the fat little kid.  She's perfect in height and weight.  She's just extremely tall.  She wears a size twelve shoe.
R:  Oh, isn't she lucky.  I'm short.  But I think --
L:  I am too.  Ah, I'm five two. [LAUGH]
R:  I'm five one.  So -- and I think my kids are gonna be tall like their daddy though.
L:  Oh, there's no doubt my daughter's -- took after her daddy's side.  There is no doubt.
R:  So, I'm glad that, ah, my kids are taking after him.  I'm --
L:  Well, you don't -- you know where they take the, um -- they say, "Take 'em at two years old and double their height as a girl"?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That puts her at six foot.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  [LAUGH] God, I hope not. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Hey, maybe she might be --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- grow up to be a famous basketball player on the, um, women's --
L:  Maybe.
R:  -- yeah, on the women's basketball.  Wouldn't that be great? [LAUGH]
L:  I don't want her to be a model.  I'd like her to have some meat on her bones so [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.  That's true.
L:  I don't want -- models are too skinny.
R:  Yeah.  They are.  Really.  And luckily these -- my thirteen year old, you know, well, she's tall and skinny.  She's took after her -- you know, she's not mine --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but she took after her daddy also.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  He was real tall and she is tiny --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I told her, I said, "You have to put some meat on your bones girl".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But she's trying.  We -- we always -- I s- -- make the kids -- we all sit down as a family at supper time at the table and --
L:  Oh, yes.  We do that here too.
R:  -- ah, you know, I make sure they eat so --
L:  Well, yeah.  I have that family time too at the dinner table.
R:  Yeah.  And you just -- just hear about --
L:  Especially as yours start getting older because you're gonna be start going in every which way. [LAUGH]
R:  That's right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And basketball and baseball and soccer ...
L:  Out here it's volleyball.  Out here it's volleyball.
R:  Oh, my goodness.  Volleyball?
L:  Volleyball's a hot item out here.
R:  What -- we have volleyball for the kids down here but it's not really hot.  Basketball and soccer and, um, baseball are --
L:  I know.  The soccer seems to be getting to be a pretty popular sport with kids.
R:  Yes.  It is.
L:  I've noticed that.
R:  My, ah, thirteen year old, she loves soccer.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, we, um --
L:  Well, there isn't really any body contact.  There's not supposed to be body contact so that's, kinda, nice. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  So, we don't wanna -- I don't wanna spend any time in the emergency room. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Our town's so small the graduate -- high school graduating class this year was eight kids.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Now, that's not really much for a senior party is it?
R:  No.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's not. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well, they had -- their town gave them their party but I'm talking the senior party.
R:  Ah, one --
L:  The real one. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] The one that all seniors have that nobody knows about right? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I just did -- I -- I couldn't even imagine being from a town [LAUGH] that small, you know?
L:  Well, we're originally from Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
R:  Oh.  Okay.
L:  So, we moved from a big city out here 'cause we wanted her to have a small town raising.
R:  Yeah.  That's -- that's nice.  And, you know, our town's twelve thousand but it's a -- 
L:  That's a good --
R:  -- it's a small town.
L:  That's a nice sized town.  It's not too --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- big and it's not too small.
R:  And I know most people.  I've lived here all my life.  I was born and raised here.
L:  Oh.
R:  And -- so, my kids know the people I know and --
L:  So, you're a local, huh? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I'm a local.  I --
L:  I --
R:  -- haven't -- I haven't moved anywhere. [LAUGH]
L:  I come in and I had to start crashing into these --
