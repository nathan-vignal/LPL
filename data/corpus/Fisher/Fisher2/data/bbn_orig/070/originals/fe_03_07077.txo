L:  Hello? [NOISE]
R:  Hi.

R:  I'm fine.  This is -- my name's Judy.
L:  I'm Lisa.  How are you?
R:  Ah, I'm fine.  So, where are you calling from?
L:  Florida.
R:  Florida?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I'm Mayfield, Kentucky.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah. [SIGH] So, how's the w- --
L:  Have you been paid for this yet?
R:  Ah, no.  I think, maybe, you get after -- you're allowed up to three calls.
L:  Okay.  Well, I don't know how many I've done buy I haven't been paid yet --
R:  Ah.  I --
L:  -- and I was concerned about.
R:  I think it's afterwards.  Um, so the topic of the day's what family means to you?  You wanna go?
L:  Sure.  Um, family's very important to me.  Um, you know, family, of course, means flesh and blood but it's also those who are supportive and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- supportive of my goals and, um, [NOISE] our lives and then, you know, my vision of family has evolved over the years as, [NOISE] um [SIGH] -- it's the University of Pennsylvania study -- as, um, [NOISE] you know, I've gotten married and started my own family.
R:  So, how old are you? [NOISE] [PAUSE]
L:  Pardon?
R:  So, how old are you? [NOISE]
L:  I'm young.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I thought you sound young.  I'm -- I'll be fifty in June.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.  I look --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- young but I -- I --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- just graduated from college and, um --
L:  Wow.  Congratulations.
R:  -- ah, thank you.  And, um, family has -- like you said, family means different things.  Um, I have my, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I have my family -- the church --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is more my choir.  We have a large choir, about eighty of us --
L:  Uh-huh.  Wow.
R:  -- and it's more like a family.  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Family's, like, at -- my school's a small, Christian college.  I was a psychology major.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  That was that but then, in my family, I'm real close to my husband and my son but my daughter --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is, ah, twenty one and she's bipolar or possible borderline personality.  She's very beautiful, very, very intelligent but we can't -- she can't live with us.  She doesn't wanna live with us and she won't take her medication so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and so, um --
L:  Is she institutionalized?
R:  No.  She won't even -- ah, she -- um, she won't take her medication.  She's living, um -- I haven't seen her since last June.
L:  Wow.
R:  I've talked to her on the phone but right now, she's just nattered.  But she's still family in my heart.
L:  Of course. [NOISE]
R:  Right.  So, do you have children?
L:  Yes ma'am.
R:  And so, um, that means a lot more to you now?
L:  Absolutely.
R:  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  I have a twenty year old son and a twenty one year old daughter.  And you?
L:  Wow.  Um, w- we just have two twin foster sons.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, um [PAUSE] what about your family growing [PAUSE] --
R:  Hello?
L:  Yes ma'am?
R:  Oh, na- -- how ab- -- what about what now?
L:  Your family growing up?
R:  Um, my family growing up was very, ah, dysfunctional.  High, ah -- they were --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- upper mi- -- upper middle --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- class in Tennessee.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  Um, yeah.  Like I said --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- m- -- both my parents were bipolar.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Um, but I still managed to, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- be a high achiever in school --
L:  That's amazing.
R:  -- and stuff and then I did my thing after I got in my twenties [LAUGH] and went through the drugs alcohol thing and didn't settle down.
L:  Do you think that's what made you desire to study psychology?
R:  Um, in a way -- in a way that I could help people because of stuff I've gone through.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  And let them know that they can make it too.
L:  Wow.  So, you just got your undergraduate in psychology?
R:  Well, yeah.  I just got my ba- -- ah, my B. -- ah, B.S.
L:  So, what do you plan on doing with it?
R:  I'm planning on, ah, getting a job this summer and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, just going from there.
L:  Wow. [NOISE] That's quite an accomplishment.
R:  Thank you.  So, do you work?
L:  No ma'am.  I stay home.
R:  That's great.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, that's great if you can be -- if you are a working mother but it's -- I think it's good if you can manage to stay home with the kids too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause you -- I don't know.  There seems so much that you miss.  I stayed home with my kids.  So --
L:  That's awesome.
R:  So, I was glad, um -- but, you know, sometimes family --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, my mother in law has meant more, you know -- been really good to us and, ah, everything but she's not blood blood.
L:  Right.
R:  So -- yeah.  And then my friends -- some of my best friends -- I have several --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they're like family.  So, I guess it's really --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a personal thing, don't you?
L:  Yeah.  Um, my actual blood family has meant a lot to me.  I'm real, real close with them and --
R:  Of course.
L:  [NOISE] Um, unfortunately, I don't live in the same city as them anymore and I wish I could find friends, like you were saying, that, you know, I felt like they were close as family.
R:  That's hard to come by.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] And when you have 'em, you better keep 'em.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  They're hard to come by.  Very hard to come by.  And, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, I'm close to my brother --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and he lives --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- within the, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- about thirty miles of me --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and everything, um, or less --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, um, I'm close to him.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, and I have a -- and one sister doesn't have anything to do with me and another one and not because -- really, the older sister doesn't have anything to do with me because, um, I was the black sheep for a long time.  She didn't like me then and then --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when I straightened up and did real well, she didn't like me then either.  So [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  So, it's like, you know, I've learned to, um -- I've learned to just, ah -- to, um, you know -- if I -- if I -- to me --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm a Christian.  If I please --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- god and my husband, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and myself, yeah, I'm doing good.
L:  That's right.
R:  Fine.  You know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I just, um -- and my -- my idea of family is to know I'm s- -- I'm a combined.  I'm some blood, some friends, in laws, you know?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  That kinda thing.  And, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And I think that's, you know -- I think that's whatever, you know, you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- can do.  But, you know, because fr- friends, like I was talking about, it took me a long time to get 'em.
L:  Wow.  Don't tell me that. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Sorry.
L:  Um, no.  You know, we try to get plugged into church and meet people that way and ...  But it's hard.
R:  But even in church it's hard.
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.  You don't know who to trust.  You don't know who's gonna be a backstabber.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or --
L:  And then in today's society, everybody -- it's not like -- it's not like in the old days where everybody lives somewhere and stays somewhere and knew everybody and knew their neighbors.  Everybody packs up and moves all the time.
R:  Right.  Well, I live in a smaller community.  I live, ah -- probably about ten thousand people.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.  And, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I live on the outskirts right, sort of, out in the country.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  About five minutes --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- from Walmart [LAUGH] -- a big Walmart.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  But --
L:  So, everybody knows everybody?
R:  Yeah.  Pretty much.  But it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But then -- ah, where I live, it's a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- very nice --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I guess what you call middle class -- upper middle class neighborhood --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and it's very -- we have our own property -- we have a trailer but it's a very -- it's p- -- my -- it was my in laws property too.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  A big part of this road was.  It's very quiet out here. It's very nice.  Nobody bothers you.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know -- you know, it's, um -- you know, nobody is recording your business --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, you know, telling it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to other people.
L:  Hm. [NOISE]
R:  So, what part of Florida are you in?
L:  Um, Central Florida.
R:  Ah, Central?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Is that, ah -- I don't know.  I'm not real acquainted with Florida.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, but I think I know, sort of, where you at.
L:  I- --
R:  Um --
L:  It's -- it's growing fast.
R:  Is it?  Well, Flori- --
L:  Everybody wants to live down here.  Of course, everybody wants to live up where you are too.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  [LAUGH] Y- --
R:  Florida -- I -- I imagine Florida's just becoming one big tourist and one big retirement --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Both.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, um -- but, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I've never been to Florida.  So, [LAUGH] -- in that time.  I've been a lot of places -- United States --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and some in the -- in the -- in the world but I have not been to Florida.  Ah --
L:  You grew up in Kentucky?
R:  No.  Tennessee.
L:  Oh.  But you live in Kentucky now?
R:  Ah, yes.  I grew up in --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- p- -- yeah.  I grew up Paris, Tennessee, which is just not very far from where we live.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, about a forty minute drive.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, that's not bad.
R:  No.  It's next county over --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- into --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- Tennessee.  We're the next county up --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and it's Kentucky.
L:  [NOISE] Wow.
R:  Ah, you can probably tell my accent has some --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I love it. [LAUGH]
R:  Thank you.  Thank you.  Ah --
L:  And what Christian college did you attend?
R:  Um, Mid Continent.  It's a small Baptist college.  Well, we're growing.  Ah, we had a hundred and forty graduating this time.  That was our largest class.
L:  Well, that certainly makes it like family doesn't it?
R:  Mhm.  And we got, ah --
L:  And when you know everybody, huh?
R:  Mm.  We --
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.  We have nineteen majors now.
L:  You have what?
R:  Nineteen majors.
L:  Okay.
R:  We've grown that far and then my -- my major was applied psychology and counseling and my minors was biblical studies and music.
L:  Wow.  Well, my mother has a degree in social work and --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- she -- she loves it.  She works mostly with the elderly.  Um --
R:  Ah, yeah.
L:  It's amazing to see different people's gifts and see what god has given them passions for.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?
R:  I saw my -- that's why I'm trusting god.  I didn't know if -- at first if you would understand if I just told you right off.  I'm just trusting god for a job this summer 'cause some people don't understand that.
L:  Oh, I understand [LAUGH] completely.
R:  But I don't know --
L:  M- --
R:  -- what.  I'm open.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm -- I'm, ah, getting over a pretty bad, ah, period of, ah, e- -- chronic fatigue syndrome.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  So, um -- but I am better.  I'm getting better so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I won't -- I'll get there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  You learn as you get older.  I mean, there's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so much [LAUGH] -- if I told you now, ah, you being younger -- there's so much, you know, that can come -- happen and stuff but you get through it.
L:  Wow.
R:  You d- -- you definitely get through it.
