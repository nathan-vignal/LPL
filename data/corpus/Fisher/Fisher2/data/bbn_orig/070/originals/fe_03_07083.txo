L:  Believe it or not, [LAUGH] it's a weird combination.
R:  Yeah, I know, we do it --
L:  But I get bored.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.  We do use, ah, Lotus Notes for email and storage purposes.
L:  Do you really?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, I didn't realize that.
R:  But not that often, like just for email, like we don't use it all -- entirely.
L:  And that's what -- that's what Col- -- um, Colgate uses, is Lotus Notes?
R:  Yes, for email purposes and sending all the documentations and stuff like that.
L:  Wow.
R:  That's what -- at least my department uses that.
L:  Yeah, I have to live -- do you listen to Howard Stern at all?
R:  Oh, a few times.
L:  Um, they -- they use Lotus Notes and he talks about it all the time, I find it very funny.
R:  Yeah, I know, it sounds kind of weird.
L:  There's -- there's not many people [LAUGH] use Lotus Notes I don't think.
R:  I [inaudible].
L:  Not a lot.
R:  Yeah, I had like a few interviews where they said, like, "Do you know how to use Lotus Notes or not?" so, I don't know.
L:  Do you like it?
R:  Yeah, it's easy to use.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Better than Outlook.
L:  Oh, yeah, I hate Outlook.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, um, you guys, you -- you've got a lot of rain recently?
R:  Ah, yeah, we still have rain today.
L:  Still?
R:  Yes.
L:  Wow.
R:  We have rain today.
L:  And it's kind of cool at night, right?
R:  Yeah, that's pretty good, like, but it's just rain.
L:  Wow.  I mean we've been going over ninety every day.
R:  Ah, oh.
L:  And then, hur- hurricane season started in and --
R:  I see.  I don't mind, like, ah, sometimes I mind rain but when it's big it's, like, it's not too hot.
L:  Right, yeah --
R:  See, it's raining right now.
L:  Is it really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, see, whe- when we get rain it's only for like ten minutes.
R:  No.  It has been raining, ah, almost all day today.
L:  Yuck.  [LAUGH] That must get annoying.
R:  Yeah, it is, a little bit.
L:  So, you're twenty four and you're at home at this time of night, were you studying?
R:  Ah, no, I'm just doing, well, ah, job search and stuff like that.
L:  Ah.
R:  Surfing the internet and stuff like that.

L:  So, you live with your mum?
R:  Yes.  Believe it or not.
L:  Hey, there's nothing wrong with that.
R:  [MN] Mm.
L:  As I keep telling my daughter, she wants to go to way -- go away to college and she says, "No, I want to stay".
R:  Ah, that's pretty good.
L:  Yes, that's good, when -- and we're close, we're very close.
R:  That's good, and the same here, especially I don't have any siblings, that's why.
L:  Mm.  Right.  Well, we -- I have a sister and she lives like five minutes from here.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  We're all -- we're all very close.
R:  That's pretty good.  I think that's what family is all about.
L:  Yeah, family is important.
R:  Yeah, very true.
L:  They're -- they're the only ones that are there when you really need somebody.
R:  That's pretty, ah, that's -- that's right.  I have, ah, that kind of experiences too.
L:  So --
R:  T- tell me about, I don't know -- tell me about your parents or whatever, something like that.
L:  Ah, well, my mum is just starting to use the computer [LAUGH] and that's very interesting.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, you got to start somewhere.
L:  She, um, yeah -- she- she's always been afraid, um, she worked for IBM for a lot of years --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and, but she left in the, like, mid eighties when --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- when, like, the internet first started --
R:  I see.
L:  -- and she hasn't touched one since, so it's -- it's real funny trying to get her on email and she doesn't understand instant messaging and --
R:  Y- yeah, that's what my mom used to say, like, "How does this thing work?"
L:  Right.
R:  "Okay.  Like talk to another person?  How is this working?" and stuff like that.
L:  Yeah, and it's so --
R:  So, I had to explain it to her how it works.
L:  -- so automatic and, you know, and tell her there's so much out there.
R:  Yes, I know, and it's getting, ah, more and more of the, ah, information overload.
L:  Right, and she doesn't understand spam and --
R:  Spam?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  She's like, "How rude".  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But I'm like, "Hey, look what you missed out on, [LAUGH] for all --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- these years, we've all been getting it".
R:  Yep, lots and lots of it.
L:  So --
R:  There are pretty good filters that can block it.
L:  Yeah.  So, what do you do for fun?
R:  Ah, I go, hang out with my friends, I go to the movies, ah, play sports.
L:  Yeah, what do you play?
R:  I play racket ball --
L:  Do you?
R:  -- and ping pong --
L:  Good for you.
R:  -- and soccer.  
L:  Ah.
R:  How about you?
L:  Um, not so much sports.  I'm -- I'm a little older than you [LAUGH] --
R:  Yes I know, just a little bit.
L:  But, um, yeah, you know, I -- I like to hang out with my friends.  We go out, we have a few drinks but then, um, I do enjoy when I go to the movies with -- with my kids, um, or we go to like go-carts --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and, um, we're working on a vacation, we'll probably go up to, um, Disney, ah, well not Disney, Orlando, and go to Universal.
R:  Yeah, that -- that sounds very good.  I heard they're giving you good deals out now -- right now because like people -- number of people visiting there have like decreased dramatically --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like in the last two years.  So, they are I think very good deals, so I was thinking about going there myself.
L:  Yeah, it's, you know, you hop in the car, at -- at least for me [LAUGH], you hop in the car and it's three hours and you're there.
R:  That's not bad.
L:  And, um, Universal, um, they have a second park, islands of adventure --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and that's really cool.
R:  Right.
L:  And they have a great roller coaster if you like roller coasters.
R:  Yes, ah.
L:  And, um, they have some really neat stuff there.
R:  Yeah, we are like visiting --
