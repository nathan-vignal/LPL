R:  I'm Debbie.
L:  Hi, I'm Bruce.  Did the [inaudible] --
R:  Bruce?
L:  Yes, ma'am.
R:  Oh, first time I got to speak to a male.  The other times it's been women.
L:  Oh, really.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
L:  So, ah -- so, what does the word family mean to you?
R:  Oh, wow.  Um, [SIGH] such a broad topic.  Um --
L:  Seriously[?].
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, 'cause um what does it mean to me?  Um, wow, that ah [MN] that's an emotional one for me.  Um [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] I -- I -- I guess because in my family it -- it felt like it was um split off or fractured and a lot of things that maybe I think I sh- -- would see or should have seen as a child maybe I didn't and I think that's why I -- this is -- it -- it feels like ah um a really big topic, you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Definitely.
R:  Yeah.  So, as far as um -- I have two brothers and I'm the oldest and um my mom died when I was like two and my father remarried [MN] --
L:  Oh, geeze.
R:  -- and my stepmother, well she never really -- we're not close.  I mean, she's never -- she doesn't remember my birthday and my father doesn't either, for that matter, [SIGH] but um [LIPSMACK] and I try to be close to my brothers and -- and growing up I -- I guess my brother -- I think the -- the one that grew up with me he had to distance himself and -- and he would never act very interested in my life --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and only until he's gotten married and has a baby who's like turning a year like this month [SIGH] you know, he calls me more than he's ever called me -- he w- -- [LAUGH] he wants me to visit and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and I -- and I want to say to him, "Well, you know, when I wanted to tell him about things I was going through, he would just shut down and say, 'That's your business, that's your life and I don't want to hear about it'" in so many words.
L:  Well --
R:  And all of a sudden he's got all this love and joy and happiness and [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I think -- I think he knows bottom line how he was and maybe he's trying to make up for all the times that he's been distant.  
L:  Maybe.
R:  Maybe that's what fatherhood does, I -- I don't know.  But um I think it's a good change -- 
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- but some--
L:  Maybe he's just become a more caring person --
R:  -- so many year- -- pardon?
L:  -- [inaudible] maybe -- maybe he's just become a more caring person, I mean.
R:  That could be it.  I -- I think when people have children ah it -- it may do something like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, you have to two ways of going.  Some people really bond with their child and some don't.
L:  Right.  Right.  Yeah, well, I mean, if I were you, I'd try to take advantage of this opportunity and you know hopefully it'll be a -- a continuing trend with him.
R:  Perhaps.  And I -- you know, I thought about going there for like um [SIGH] well, her birthday's like the fifteenth, which happens to be father's day and my father's going to be there and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I'm almost thinking about backing out because I just feel slighted that, you know, he forgot my birthday once again this year and I was going to mention it over the phone, but I'm like [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] so I don't know, Bruce, what do you think?  I don't know.
L:  I -- I wouldn't give up on it just yet.  I -- I would -- I would go to this -- this ah upcoming reunion um just because there -- I -- I can't see any harm coming from it, um --
R:  No, not at all.  Yeah, I -- I just think it's really kind of significant that my birthday is like the fifteenth and her's is the fifteenth and, you know, she's the newcomer and I'm -- e- -- well, I'm just saying, how can one forget that date and he has forgotten so many years of my life.
L:  Oh, geeze.
R:  Because he wasn't, you know, we were -- he was in a different State and but I -- I -- it's just very -- and I don't want to go there seeming like I'm a jealous older -- o- -- you know what I'm saying?
L:  Right.
R:  And I should have maybe mentioned it the last time we spoke, but I didn't, you know, and that's -- that's one thing I need to learn is to [SIGH] express those feelings of um [MN] [LIPSMACK] disappointment, um, rather than maybe c- -- coming off as seeming something other than what it is --
L:  Maybe as a gift sometime you could give him a -- a calendar marked on it, maybe he would get the message.
R:  That's a cute idea.  That's a cute idea.  Um [SIGH] --
L:  Um --
R:  -- so, what does family mean to you?
L:  Well, um, to me ah it means a lot of things, just I -- I actually have a -- have a pretty strong nuclear family, however um all of my other relatives, even first cousins, aunts and uncles and everything, I'm pretty distant from.
R:  Hm.
L:  And um it's -- I don't know, it's -- it's kind of like ah -- ah -- a dichotomy I guess just because ah they're just um my relationship between the -- the two different groups of people are just so um completely different.  
R:  Does that --
L:  I -- I see my -- I mean, I'm in college now, so I don't see my ah family that much --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but um I -- I used to see them every day and you know we're -- we're all very close, but --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- yeah, for some reason, my mom doesn't you know, didn't really have a good childhood and she is kind of distant from most of her um -- her close relatives, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, um, consequently my brother and I don't get to see, you know, my aunts and uncles very much or my ah cousins and um and especially our grandmother, um, my mom really doesn't like her mom very much, so we --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- we don't see her very much.  I -- I think things are on the upswing now, I think that their relationship's getting a little bit better, but um I- -- it's -- it's kind of rough sometimes.  And I --
R:  Yeah, it sounds like some heavy duty things have happened in the past that um doesn't concern you but you're not really close with your cousins and aunts and --
L:  Well, the thing is that when I see them, we're o- -- we're definitely on good terms and everything, it's just that we don't get to see them very often because my parents never take the opportunity to go visit them that often.  But I -- I mean I think it's getting better.  And I'm definitely -- and I mean, I went to go see my -- my cousins' weddings and everything, so, you know, at least the important stuff I know I've been at.  I -- and then the -- the other thing is that my dad is really close to all of his relatives.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And however his relatives live far away.  So, there's kind of like a tug of war going --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in my family at times with my dad wanting to go long distances to visit his relatives and then my mom complaining about it because you know we never get to go visit her relatives, when in reality she doesn't want to see her relatives anyway because --
R:  Do you know why your mother feels the way she does about her mother and her side of the family?
L:  It w- -- it was -- it was mostly just um she grew up in a -- ah broken family, her parents divorced --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and um she just didn't have the greatest childhood.  Ah, her -- her older um siblings and some of her friends like helped raise her a lot.  Um, but ah I mean it's all in the past ah and as far as I'm concerned, I --
R:  But it can still affect --
L:  I --
R:  -- the present.
L:  Oh yeah, definitely.
R:  Y- -- you know, u- -- unless something is straightened out, it [LIPSMACK] it's like she's like being passive aggressive as far as um, "I don't want to go with you, I never get to see my family" and still she's got these issues with them, you know, so it -- it's kind of like she uses it as a hold out, even though she probably deep down doesn't really want to go, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like you said.  So, it's like it's still affecting everything else --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because it kind of puts a damper on your father's plans, you know, if he has --
L:  Well, a- absolutely.
R:  Yes, he --
L:  But um yeah I do -- on the upswing ah my -- I called the other day, um, just to say hi, or actually it was a few weeks ago, and you know just to say hi to them and I -- she -- they ended up passing the phone around to like half of my relatives --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because for some reason they were all hanging out at my house that day.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it -- it really just blew me away.  Maybe -- maybe when I get back to my home -- home town, things w- -- things will be different and will have changed, but -- which would be awesome --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [inaudible] ah I just don't know how it is right now.  I'm -- I'm actually the one who's kind of um you know not hanging -- not hanging around very much lately just because um my family is from North Carolina and I'm in Philadelphia now, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in college --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so you know I can hardly ever go down to see them and I won't actually be going back home for another couple of weeks so it'll -- it'll have been several months since I've --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- seen any of them.
R:  Uh-huh.  [PAUSE] Well, I mean --
L:  But I mean, what can you do about that?  It's not like it's an in- -- an intentional vo- -- avoidance of my family.
R:  Yeah.  Do you have brothers and sisters?
L:  Yes, I have a younger brother.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And he's still in high school, though.
R:  Oh.
L:  Um --
R:  Well.
L:  [MN] He -- he still hangs around ah with the family a lot --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and ah yeah, I so- -- ah I sometimes miss ah them all but um not so much because I know that um I know they're doing well, I get to talk to them a lot and I now have a reason for not hanging around, so ...
R:  Mhm.  [PAUSE] Well.  What -- it -- it sounds like maybe like you said things are on the upswing and like maybe you could, I don't know, call them or -- or email or something like that or just to stay --
L:  Yeah [MN] it's um I -- I actually get free long distance so um -- and they can call my phone whenever because ah the same area code deal --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and so ah basically we can talk whenever we want.
R:  Do they do that?
L:  It's just about a --
R:  Do they keep in touch?
L:  They keep in touch pretty well.  Um, there were times earlier this year when I was
