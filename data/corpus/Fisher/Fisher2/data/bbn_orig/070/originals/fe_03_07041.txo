L:  [NOISE] Hello?
R:  Hello.  My name's Candace.
L:  Hi.  I'm Tina.  I'm from, um, Southern California.
R:  Okay.  I'm in Arlington, Virginia.
L:  [MN] Um, [LIPSMACK] I guess we're supposed to talk about family?
R:  Yes.  What family means to each of us.  Would you like to go first?
L:  Sure. [NOISE] Um, well, I guess, um ...  I'm a stay at home mom with, um, two sons and, um -- um, the word family just means [LIPSMACK] -- I don't know.  Gosh.  It's such a broad word. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, [NOISE] well, I like to think that we're epitomizing the family by, um -- I stay home with my children and my husband [NOISE] works and, um [LIPSMACK] -- yeah.  And he's got a really nice job -- he's a computer [NOISE] engineer and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, [NOISE] and I appreciate the fact that he works so hard that I can do that -- stay home.
R:  Stay home.  That's important.
L:  Right.  Yes.
R:  You're lucky. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  I know I am.  I know I am.
R:  Um, family, to me, means a variety of things.  I'm actually a single parent mom, um, but I'm tr- -- I'm working on getting to stay at home with her.  Um, and she and I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- are a family, in my opinion.  Um, even though we're such a small family --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- she's -- sh- she's the most family I've ever had in terms of my emotional bond with her.  Also, um, family, to me, can be friends.  Sometimes I think your friends can be more family, um, than your own family just because my own family and I are, kinda, all over the United States.  Um, a- --
L:  That's so true.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I have to agree with you because I don't have a- -- you know, all my entire family here with me either and they certainly can feel like family.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And where would you be without your good friends?
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Let's see ...  Family also means, to me, I think -- I'm -- I'm actually debating whether or not you should be loyal to someone just because you're related by blood.
L:  Right.
R:  Or, you know, whether you can be absolutely loyal to someone who is not your blood.  For example, a husband.  If a husband --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I ask my friends that are married sometimes if your husband --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- cheated on --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you would you leave?
L:  Right.
R:  Um, simply because in some religions, you know, they say your husband becomes your flesh and blood once you're married, once you're united.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But there are some people that disagree with that.  What do you think --
L:  No.
R:  -- as a married woman?
L:  Um, [SIGH] well, [NOISE] my husband and I we're [SIGH] -- we've been together so [NOISE] long and he does feel like my family. [NOISE] Um, actually when you have a good marriage and -- and no one cheats on the other and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, I've -- it's hard for me to say m- -- you know, to disagree with that but, ah, [NOISE] I d- -- I don't have, um [NOISE] any problem [NOISE] with saying that he is my family and I'm a hundred percent devoted to him and -- and same for him.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know that he would never cheat on me.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Or at least I don't believe that he would.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um --
R:  What do you think about adoption?  Does adoption e- -- 
L:  Oh --
R:  -- does that equal family?
L:  Absolutely.  I mean, what does it really matter [NOISE] if they're adopted or if it's your flesh and blood?  I mean, if you really, really want a child and you have all that love to give --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's still -- there's no reason why you can't feel toward that adoptive child as you would --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with your own.
R:  How do you --
L:  I mean, when you're with them, when they're so little and -- [NOISE] and they grow up [NOISE] with y- -- with you and you're the only parent they've ever had and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know? [NOISE]
R:  So, if you would --
L:  It's just as good.
R:  If you could define the word family in a sentence, what would -- what would you come up with?
L:  Mm ... [PAUSE]
R:  Or you wanna talk about something else? [LAUGH]
L:  No, no.
R:  That's, kind of, a hard question.  I just -- I just thought to myself, "Would I wanna answer that?" [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, actually it's, kinda, tough.
L:  Oh.  It is w- -- especially since what you're s- -- you're saying.
R:  Mhm.
L:  See, u- um -- I am -- I live in a community where the -- my family is the norm.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, everyone -- there are a lot of -- of women stay home with their children and it's just, um, very old fashioned community.
R:  That's awesome.
L:  But [SIGH] --
R:  And see, you're sighing as if not really.  The grass is always greener on the other side.  And here I am, a single parent in the city, wishing I had that.  You know what I mean?
L:  Oh, ah, no.  I don't feel that the grass is greener.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Absolutely not.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- I'm loving my life and, ah, I just couldn't ask for anything better.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um [SIGH] -- um, it's just, um -- for me to define family it just -- to me, it's, like, redefine family and just, ah ...
R:  Well, since you mention the term community --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'm gonna ask a sensitive question.  Um, relating this to the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- topic of family, do you think, interracial dating is okay?  Do you think an interracial couple -- or do you think people can become family across interracial lines?
L:  I -- I've seen it all the time.  I sh- -- I certainly do feel that they could.
R:  Mhm.
L:  If they can overlook it, everyone else should be able to overlook it.
R:  Right.
L:  And it -- it doesn't [NOISE] [PAUSE] -- oh, it's [SIGH] -- that's -- that's a --
R:  It's a good question.  It's a tough --
L:  It sure is a good que- --
R:  -- tough topic.
L:  It is a tough topic.  But I do know of, um, quite a few.  My, um -- some of my extended family, um -- we're Caucasian and my, ah, husband's brother, they've married, um -- ah, actually the -- qu- -- a few of 'em have married Mexicans. [NOISE]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, you know, I -- I certainly think it's -- it's fine and they've -- they're all very happy.  It's wonderful.
R:  Wow.
L:  If everyone can overlook all of that.  And I mean, there's bad people in any race.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And if you -- and if you just generalize, you know, [NOISE] it's -- it's easy to start discriminating and start looking at just the bad side of, you know, any race.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But these -- these woman that -- they're now part of our family and they're no different than the rest of us.  We love them -- I love them like my own sisters.  They're great.
R:  Wonderful.
L:  Mm. [LIPSMACK]
R:  [LIPSMACK] Okay.  You ask me a question. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [PAUSE] Yeah.  Um, gosh. [SIGH] Um, [LIPSMACK] I know, um -- I have a cousin that's, um, single mom and she, ah, had, um, artificial insemination to have her daughter.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um, I guess, how does it feel to you to -- to just be on your own and not foot -- and not have anybody to [SIGH] [NOISE] -- gosh --
R:  To foot -- foot the bill list?
L:  That does foot the bill and -- and the -- just the whole thing.  I mean, i- it's such a huge responsibility being a --
R:  It is.
L:  -- a parent.
R:  It is.
L:  That I -- I don't know how I could ever do it alone and I've always wanted to ask my cousin that but I always feel like I would be overstepping my, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- my bounds by -- by s- -- asking her something like that but --
R:  Oh, really?  Even though you're family you don't feel like you --
L:  Well --
R:  -- could ask her a personal question?
L:  I have -- I have a lot of family. [LAUGH] 
R:  Hm.  Okay.
L:  I have, like, a huge extended family.  My mother comes from a family of, um, twenty thr- -- twenty one children.
R:  Mhm.
L:  There were twenty three born to this family.  So, I have about [SIGH] -- I don't even know how many cousins -- first cousins I have.  Somewhere in the sixties or seventies.  I haven't even sat down to count 'em all 'cause we have so many.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, so, I have a lot of relatives that I'm not very close with because there's so many of 'em.  And I -- she lives in Arizona and I live in California.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, we never see each other really.  Hardly ever.
R:  Well, for me --
L:  But --
R:  I'm only twenty five years old and I think, due to the fact that I'm, kind of, young, um, my view of what family is, is less traditional --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, than people a little older than me.
L:  Hm.
R:  Um, I don't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and probably because of the relationship I had with her father, um, I don't feel as if I'm missing out or if I -- e- -- or as if I was abandoned or anything like that.  Her father was actually murdered --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- um, accidentally and before he was murdered I was actually engaged to be married to him.  So, s- -- I somewhat, I guess, feel appeased in my single motherness because I was established.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, I -- I look at myself, kinda -- and this is -- I f- -- kinda, feel embarrassed to say this but, like, when I look at other mothers, um, who are single parents who, say, are poor or, you know, had sex one time and got dumped by the guy and -- and got pregnant, I separate myself from that.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I say to myself, "Well, I'm not from that.  I was engaged to be married and I got --"
