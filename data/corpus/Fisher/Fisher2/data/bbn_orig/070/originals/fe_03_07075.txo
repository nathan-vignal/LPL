L:  Ah, Rebecca.
R:  Hi.  Nice to meet you. [LAUGH]
L:  Nice to meet you too. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay. [LAUGH] Um, so I guess what family means to me?  I guess it's one of the most important things in --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- my life.
L:  Sure.
R:  Definitely.  Yeah.  I think they're all the people I trust. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's love, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Sharing things with your family and family's on- -- the only -- the only closest thing you have in -- in the world is your family.
R:  Exactly.
L:  You can go to 'em whenever you want, you know?
R:  I -- I agree with that.
L:  And you can trust 'em.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ...
R:  So, I mean, my family's, kind of, small -- like, my immediate family.
L:  Ah --
R:  But definitely, um -- [LIPSMACK] I'm, definitely, like, very[?] much of our family and everything like that.  What about you?
L:  What's that?
R:  I said what about you?  Y- you like a big family or a small family?
L:  Ah, it's not too big.
R:  Mhm.
L:  About average.  Yeah.  It's average.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Not way, way big, you know, like, sixteen kids and [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, gosh. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  It's average.
R:  I couldn't imagine -- yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But since -- my, um -- my boyfriend, he, like -- he's totally -- I don't know.  I don't understand him sometimes 'cause he's, like, "Oh, you know, my father, he's not this, he's not that" blah blah blah blah but then, like, he goes to his father for help, like, all the time.  I'm like, "Well, your father can't be too terrible --
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- if he helps you out all the time" you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I try not to get into it 'cause everybody's family situation is --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- their own.  But -- crazy. [NOISE]
L:  Blood is thicker than water.  That's what they say.  Yeah.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.  So ...
R:  So, have you done this before?  The, um --
L:  Ah, I did it once before.  Yeah.
R:  This is my third time I think 'cause, you know, I -- I didn't recognize the number --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I kept ignoring it.  And, so --
L:  Yeah.  It says University of Penn.  I got caller ID so [LAUGH] ...
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, like, it's on my cellphone and I'm looking at it and I'm, like, two one two?  I was, like -- or two one seven or whatever -- I was, like, "Ah, I don't know anybody from there".
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I was, like -- I'd ignore it and then I'd find out that it was them.
L:  Yeah.  Sometimes they're, like, telemarketers.  You're like, "No.  I don't wanna answer it". [LAUGH]
R:  I know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I hate that.  And, like, on my cellphone, like -- I flew up to see my boyfriend 'cause he lives in Miami --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I flew on Delta and ever since then, when I signed up for the Sky Miles program --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- those people are so annoying.
L:  M- --
R:  Like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, when you sign up just for the card.  Like, I didn't want, like, a credit card but just the Sky Miles card.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And they were, like, oh, you know, "Would you like this?  Would you like that?"  And I'm, like, you know, "I don't want anything".
L:  Oh, exactly.
R:  And they're really persistent.
L:  Oh, yeah.  They are.  'Cause they want your business.  Yeah.
R:  Exactly.
L:  So -- I don't know.
R:  I'm, like, I'm not in love with Delta because the last time I flew on them --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Like, I live in New Jersey and so I was flying out of Newark and the -- it was -- it was, like, you know, we've got a lot of snow up here but the runway was clear.
L:  Uh-huh.  Sure.
R:  And this was, like, Valentines weekend.  And so, we flew out and the man flew, like, when he banked, it was so hard, ah, like, you could feel, like, the entire plane was shaking.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And the l- -- [LAUGH]
L:  Turbulence.
R:  And the lady next to me --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- she was, like, flipping out.  And I'm, like -- I'm serious, like, you -- I was, like -- it was like every nut and bolt in that plane l- -- was, like, being tested --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for strength or something.  It was terrible.
L:  Ever since ni- -- ni- --  ever since nine eleven, it's, like, ah.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.  You're worried about flying.  Just rather drive.
R:  Yeah.  I've always --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And, like, I used to love flying and then --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, when I got into college, I had to fly home all the time, I started to not like it as much.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then, like, after nine eleven, I was, like, "Oh, yeah.  I hate this.  This is terrible".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause there's [inaudible] are going.  Yeah.  So ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.
R:  Gosh. [PAUSE] Ten minutes is, like, a long time. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Th- they say ten minutes.  I did this once before I th- -- um, I don't remember what the topic was.  Oh, the topic was --
R:  I know.
L:  -- ah, public schools or something like that.  Yeah.  Public schools.
R:  My -- this is my third time so I guess I'm done now after this one.  I'm -- 
L:  Yeah.  I know.
R:  'cause the first one --
L:  Then they're supposed to send you out [LAUGH] one of your f- --
R:  I know.
L:  I know.
R:  Like, can I have my thirty dollars now?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But [LAUGH] -- but the first one we talked about hobbies and then the second one --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- was, like, court TV.  And, like -- like, the hobbies --
L:  Oh, court TV?
R:  You know, the court TV was boring so I was, like, "Okay".
L:  Yeah.
R:  No. [LAUGH]
L:  Different topics.  Yeah.  So, it's like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if you don't know about some- --
R:  But at least they didn't, like, say anything crazy.
L:  But there's only so much you can say about the topic because then you --
R:  You know --
L:  -- like, run out of things [LAUGH] to say. [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  I mean, 'cause, like, after a while you're, like, "Yeah, I disagree".
L:  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.
R:  Yup.  I disagree.  I mean, it -- it's boring.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.
L:  Well, family -- there's not much you can say about it.  It's, like, well, you're with your family for life, you know?
R:  I know.  You can't --
L:  Y- --
R:  -- pick them --
L:  You can't --
R:  -- so --
L:  You can't hold any grudges because they're your family.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You can be mad but --
R:  A lot of people try. [LAUGH]
L:  -- l- life is too short to be mad.
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know, these people that get over f- -- get in fights with their sisters and brothers, like, hold grudges and, like -- 'til, like, fifty years old and they regret it. [LAUGH]
R:  I know.
L:  Yeah.  It's so stupid.
R:  I was, like -- that's a long time --
L:  You know?  And se- --
R:  -- to sit there and, l- -- I mean, like, why hold all that anger in?  Just get over it.
L:  Get mad and -- I -- I get mad at my sisters.  I -- I just get mad and I get over it.
R:  Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, that's why I sound, like, you know -- if my sister does something that I don't like, I'm just gonna be, like, "You know what?  You suck". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  And then I'm gonna go on, you know?  I'm not gonna keep being, like --
L:  Yeah
R:  -- "Hm, I'm mad at you".
L:  Don't hold a grudge for, like, twenty years.
R:  Mm mm.
L:  It ain't worth it.  No.
R:  Terrible.
L:  Yeah.  So ...  I [SIGH] don't know.
R:  Gosh.  So, are you in school or are you older or what?
L:  Oh, I'm older.  I have twin boys.
R:  Oh, wow.  That's cool.
L:  Yeah.  Two six year olds.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  They keep --
R:  So, how is it with ti- -- twins?  'Cause my cousin --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- she, um -- she's pregnant with twins actually.
L:  Oh, yeah? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, it's -- yeah.  And when they're babies it's, like, you're gonna pull your hair out but once -- once they get older --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's so much easier.  So much easier --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- when they get older.  'Cause you know --
R:  That's cool.
L:  -- they're doing different things.
R:  Right.  Well, do you ever have, like, that issue where they wanna be, like, independent of the other?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause I knew like -- and when I was go- -- in high school, um, there were, like, a lot of twins and we even had a set of triplets.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they were -- like, one was always, like, more dominant than the other and, like, one was always trying show that they weren't just like the other.  'Cause, like, it was mostly identical twins.  But like, there are a few fraternals that [inaudible] there.
L:  Yeah.  There is.  Yup.  So -- I don't know. [PAUSE]
R:  [NOISE] M- --
L:  But -- yeah.  Family's most important.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Especially when you have kids, you know?  You gotta be by 'em -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- by their side all the time.
R:  Huh?
L:  They need -- especially when you have kids.  I mean, you're g- --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you're gonna need 'em all the time.  Yeah.
R:  My sister and I got along when we were little though.  We didn't have a lot of fights.  I was nice.
L:  Yeah. [PAUSE]
R:  [NOISE] Hm. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  So, this is my second time they did it and then I just want them to send me the check. [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm, like, in that referral program.  I was, like, "Okay".
L:  It's a Fisher study.  Yeah.  They pen -- they pay you ten dollars for each call you get.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But then there was the referral thing, like, for every man that you refer to them --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- you get, like, five dollars or something.  I was, like, "Okay".
L:  Yeah.  But --
R:  And I can't get any of my guy friends to do it.  So, they're, like, ah --
L:  They won't do it.  No.  'Cause they're too busy.
R:  Exactly.  They're, like, "Why would I do that?  That's stupid".  I was, like, "You get paid".
L:  Yeah.  But --
R:  They're, like, "So?"
L:  They have better [LAUGH] things to do and like [LAUGH] --
R:  I know. [LAUGH]
L:  Probably go drinking or something. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, yeah.  Hang out with frat buddies.
L:  But we're more calm and collective, you know?  We like --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- to do things that can make us e- -- get easy money. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  The first one --
L:  That's how I think of it.  Yapping on the phone --
R:  The first --
L:  -- I can do that. [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  That's one thing I do easily.  But --
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  -- the first one, it was a guy that I was talking to.  It was, like, this [inaudible] --
L:  Oh, god.
R:  -- year old hairdresser from California.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And he was, like, "Oh, wow.  You sound young".  I was, like, "Um, yeah.
L:  Oh, god.
R:  Okay. [LAUGH]
L:  Hm.
R:  What's more was, like, he said, "Where are you from?"  I was, like, "Indiana".
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  You just say something really quick. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.  So --
R:  So, it, kind of, threw me.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's a hard -- like, let me be careful.  I don't want some, like, phone stalker type thing.
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  'Cause he was a little too eager.
L:  It's, like, you're trying to get to know me and I'm, like, I don't even know you. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  So, it's funny.  I don't know.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] [PAUSE] Gosh.  I hate looking for jobs.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Or --
L:  Oh, you're looking for a job?  Yeah.  It's hard because unemployment and all?
R:  You know, um --

R:  -- you're, like -- you go like -- I went on two job interviews today and I was, like, going to sapping[?] agencies and they were, like, "Okay.  So, can you do this?  Can you do this?"  And I spent forty five minutes doing those stupid tests about, like, Word, Excel --
L:  Oh, yeah.  I know exact- -- I know what you're -- you going through.
R:  He sat --
L:  I -- like, every job you have to, like, take a test.  It's like, what --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- this is so stupid.  I could be doing m- -- you know --
R:  Something else.
L:  -- valuable thing with my time.
R:  No.  'Cause, like, I had --
L:  But -- yeah.
R:  -- scheduled on my -- I thought I had scheduled my appointments far enough apart but, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I was late with the second one because that's how long the first one was.  It was, like -- they made me wait for, like, twenty minutes, then I sat the test for forty five minutes and then I still had to talk to the, like -- the little recruiter woman afterwards.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I was, like, you know, you either want me or you don't. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly. [LAUGH]
R:  So, why all the tests? [LAUGH]
L:  Don't waste my time.  Tell me if I got the job or not so I can go. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  At some t- --
L:  Ah --
R:  -- and they didn't have any job offers.  They were just, like, "Oh, thanks for taking the tests.  We'll call you".
L:  Yeah.  That's stupid.  They make you take the tests, you wait in line, make -- take the tests and they're, like, "Oh, we don't need you".
R:  Exact- --
L:  And you just wanna -- you just wanna flip -- flip 'em off. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It was, like, this, ah, so- --
L:  You wasted my time.  I could've been done -- doing -- I could've been finding another job.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause, ah -- you know, I mean, I hate job interviews 'cause they're so frustrating.
L:  Ah, oh, they are.
R:  'Cause the person says, "So --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- why do you want a job?"  I'm, like, "Well, [SIGH] I like to get paid".
L:  Well, I need money. [LAUGH]
R:  I know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I was, like, what am I supposed to say?
