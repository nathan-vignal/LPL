L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  I've never done this before. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  My name is Cindy.
L:  I'm Susan.
R:  Hi Susan.
L:  I don't know what we're doing here.
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, did you hear the topic is education?
L:  Right.  On computers.  I heard that.
R:  And so, we're just talking about if we think education -- I mean, computers enhance or distract from education.
L:  Absolutely enhance.
R:  Um, I think, in a lot of ways, that they do enhance.  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But in some ways, I think that, um, [LIPSMACK] kids nowadays don't learn how to do it the long way, so to speak.
L:  Well, that depends.  I mean, I know I make my kids do it the long way.  They need to know what it is that they're doing.  But I think having computers is -- has really made a difference.  My son's in fourth grade and just did a PowerPoint presentation 'cause of something he learned in school.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Which I think is excellent.
R:  But if they just use computers and they didn't learn the other way, then that wouldn't be --
L:  No, but he did.
R:  -- very good either.
L:  He used -- he used the presentation to add to his presentation.
R:  Mhm.
L:  He had to speak what he was doing.  He had to know the information.  He had to know it before he could make the presentation --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- before he could even make the PowerPoint.  So, I mean, I don't agree with that.  I think it definitely enhances what they're doing.
R:  Well, I've noticed that when you go to the stores and as long as the computer --cash register is counting out the change, sometimes the kids are okay but if they have to count it out themselves --
L:  Oh, I agree with you there.
R:  -- they just don't know what to do.
L:  I agree with that.  But I -- you know, I told my kids -- more responsible.  I -- I mean, it's very important to me that they know how to do these things so --
R:  Well, yeah.
L:  I -- I -- you know, I think that -- that it's there to help people and those who choose not to are -- are -- are the ones suffering from it but I -- I don't think that it's a detriment to them because the opportunity is there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, that's my opinion.
R:  Well, I think that they're putting computers in all the school nowadays.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  As far as I know.  I don't know.
L:  Yeah, they are.  As far as I know they are.
R:  Your kids are in what grades?
L:  Ah, going to ninth and going to fifth.
R:  Fifth and ninth?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Hm.  It's a public school?
L:  Public school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And you? Do you have kids using them in school?
R:  Um, I do.  I have a -- well, I have one that's, um, going -- well, just finishing up the tenth grade.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And one that's graduating.  And I have another one who's older.  And, um, ah, you know, they've had s- somewhat of computers.  We have a computer at home -- we always have.  They're pretty computer literate, um, in that respect.  Um, the schools, you know, have been coming into the computer age as they were getting their education --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so to speak.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause there didn't used to be computers.
L:  Well, and I -- I think the schools are holding them, somewhat, accountable though because they're making sure they know what they're doing before they're teaching them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ah, you know, how to use the computer.  I mean, [PAUSE] I --
R:  Well, probably, I would imagine that, you know, i- in, um, y- -- though computers are good for some things in the, you know -- the basics, ah, you know, teachers are also good.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Doesn't replace the teacher in the classroom or anything.
L:  Oh, absolutely not.  It shouldn't.  It shouldn't replace a teacher.  I mean, you need a human being.  You can't always have a machine.
R:  Ah, did your, um, kids have computer games when they were younger?
L:  [SIGH] Ah, yes but, ah, they never really did them as much as -- as they do now that they're older and under -- you know, they're more involved games.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know?
R:  You mean, like, a- a- -- Xbox and all those kind of g- -- things?
L:  Right.  Right.  They didn't -- even when they were younger I didn't have them doing any of that.
R:  Oh.  Did -- did you ever have them do the -- the educational things on the computer?
L:  No.
R:  Oh.  Oh.  That's where I think a -- ah, you know, is -- is good with the educational -- you could start those pretty early, I think, in school.
L:  Oh, you could.  Ah --
R:  As long as they learn, you know, ah, reading, writing and arithmetic.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Being computer literate is a big plus in this day and age.
L:  Oh, yeah.  It only -- it only enhances it.  It only helps them.
R:  Do they have a computer at home?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Absolutely.  I mean, they have to.
R:  Do they have their own or you have a family --
L:  Family.
R:  -- family computer?  Yeah.  Us too.
L:  Yeah.  So --
R:  I guess, ah -- you know, I've heard that there's a lot of education that's going strictly to computers.  I mean, a lot of college courses now are -- are over the internet.  My son told me.
L:  Yeah.  That's available to them.  I mean, I -- I think anybody who's gonna do that without having the benefit of a teacher but -- you know, it -- it's -- depends too because it's quicker if you need to get through something but if you need to make sure you're learning, I mean, that's not the way to go.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But you can --
R:  I don't know how they do it.
L:  Well, you can do it for things, like, ah, traffic school even.
R:  Oh, I did that.
L:  I did that too. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] I had to do the traffic school thing.
L:  Yeah.  You know, it's th- -- we don't have to take the time -- you do it in your own time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ...
R:  I did hear that, um, ah -- I heard some place that home schooling -- that you can home school your child and, ah, they have a -- a teacher over the internet.
L:  I think that's terrible. [LAUGH]
R:  So, people that are into that can do that.
L:  Yeah.  I know.  Personally, I think that that's terrible.  I mean, I'd rather -- I'd -- y- you need the human interaction.  You need -- you know?  I just --
R:  Well, I don't know.  Because if a person has chosen to home school their -- given the education in the home to their child, in a way --
L:  But if you sit 'em on a computer --
R:  In a way, having a teacher, you know -- for them to be able to do their work at home and have a -- someone who's a qualified teacher grade their work, I think is a plus.
L:  Well, you say grade their work --
R:  Like, if they write an essay.  You know, they write a --
L:  O- over the computer?
R:  They write an essay and they send it over -- they'd send -- you know, over the internet.
L:  Right.  And then who's -- who's checking it?
R:  A- and then the teacher will grade it.  They'll like -- an English teacher.
L:  Huh.
R:  A real English teacher --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- would grade it, you know, and give her recommendations and stuff and then send it back to the home.  I think that's a -- a better alternative than, a lot of times, having the parent grade it.
L:  Oh, yeah.  That -- that I agree with.
R:  I mean --
L:  That I agree with because sh- -- you need an objective --
R:  I would think that --
L:  -- point of view.
R:  -- they would, um, ah, be, personally, more qualified.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I don't understand wh- -- well, that's a whole another story. [LAUGH] I won't even go into that.  But, you know, I -- overall, I think it's a good thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I think it's a good thing.  So --
R:  Well, where do you think education is going with computers in the school?
L:  I know that my kids are able to do so many more things than I was ever able to do in school.  The fact, like I say, he's doing a PowerPoint in fourth grade.
R:  Mhm.
L:  The -- you know, being able to learn how to do financial things with spreadsheets.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, it's a great tool.  Now, I used to teach -- I used to teach math.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Com- -- they -- people started with com- -- with calculators.  I used to make 'em do it by hand --
R:  Oh, yeah.  There you go.
L:  -- and then do it on the calculator.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?  As long as you know how to do it --
R:  That's like what I was talking about.
L:  Right.  No, no, no.  I know and as -- as long as you know how to do these things, I mean, it can only help it.  It can only enhance it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't think it should replace it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ...
R:  Um, in your public school that your kids go to, do they have, like, a -- a computer at each desk?
L:  No.
R:  'Cause I'm not familiar with that.
L:  No.  No.  No.  I know -- and now, my son's in elementary school and they go to a computer lab a couple of times a week and they go and --
R:  Oh, computer lab?  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  And they share computers.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And with my daughter, I don't think, ah -- I don't think she's got access -- junior high school -- she's going to high school -- I don't think she's got access to a computer other than going to, you know, library or whatever or if there's a s- -- you know, a certain place in the classroom.  They don't have 'em on their desks.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So --
R:  I understand that there are some schools that require that children have laptops that they take with them.
L:  [LAUGH] I haven't heard that one yet.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Glad to hear it -- that I haven't heard it.
R:  I guess it's a m- m- -- a private, kinda, thing but that they -- are required, you know -- they take all their notes and everything on their laptop.
L:  Wow.  You know, I know when my daughter was in first grade -- now, she's going to ninth -- when she was in first grade, they were required to do keyboarding every night.
R:  Mm.
L:  And I -- you know, for ten minutes a night.  And I really think it helped.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I really do.  'Cause they do use it now.  They do need to know, you know?
R:  What state are you in?
L:  I'm in California.
R:  Oh.  So am I.
L:  Where are you?
R:  I'm in the San Fernando Valley.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH] I'm in Valencia.
R:  Oh, not too far.
L:  How funny.  Not at all.  Where in the San Fernando Valley are you?
R:  Um, in Northridge.
L:  Oh, [LAUGH] not far at all.
R:  Yeah.  So, your kids go to the public school out --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in Valencia?
L:  But that's why we moved here was for the schools.
R:  Well, I can understand that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's why my kids go to private school.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, you know, I can -- I can understand that. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Where do they go?  Chaminade?
R:  Ah, no.  I have one up at Hillcrest now and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I have one at LA Lutheran.
L:  Okay.  Yeah.  Now, that's exactly why I moved just so they could go to public a school.  You know, they're -- they're not being sat in front of a computer and being taught by a machine.  I mean, they have great teachers and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they're in award winning schools.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it's real important to me.
R:  And you're still teaching?
L:  No.
R:  Oh.
L:  No.  I haven't taught in years.
R:  No.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Too much to do, huh?
L:  Too much to do.  Yeah.
R:  Too little time.
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] So --
R:  Well, what other things have we not explored about --
L:  I don't know.  How you --
R:  -- education and computers?
L:  I -- I don't even -- you know, I've never done one of these before.  What -- are we just supposed to talk about this and then what?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Are they listening?
R:  Just --
