R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  This is Melody.
L:  Hi Melody.  My name's Tanya.  How're you doing?
R:  Hi.  Okay.  [LAUGH] Ah -- 
L:  And the topic is, ah, computers -- 
R:  I guess -- 
L:  -- ah, what is it?  Do we think it's good -- 
R:  Yeah, w- whether it's I guess improving or -- or sort of like it -- 
L:  It -- 
R:  -- um, [LAUGH] not -- 
L:  Improving e- -- the education?
R:  -- not advantageous, you know, to education, yeah.
L:  For kids.  Well, I think, um, personally myself, I think they're very educational.  Now, me myself, I'm just learning about computers so I'm -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- basically computer illiterate.
R:  [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] 
L:  I mean, you know -- 
R:  So, that makes too of us.
L:  -- I know the key pad and I know how to type but I'm a -- a -- 
R:  L- l- learn as you go.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Huh?
R:  L- learn as you go.
L:  Yeah, that's basically how I do it.  Now, um, [MN] I do know how to go in and play some of the games and I do --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- have an email address but I think, um, computers are very important for, um, children to learn.  Like my, um, [MN] my children who are in the preschool, they h- -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- play -- do little things on the computer.  So, I think they're very good for the kids.
R:  Yeah, 'cause actually I -- I guess, too it's, you know, and they used to just have books.  You know, like story books or books that would h- you know, math books or something where they kind of, you know, get pictures, you know, [LAUGH] like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- an apple in -- in -- in one and another apple, you know, t- -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and that type of thing.
L:  And -- 
R:  But, I guess if you can do something like that, you know -- 
L:  Yeah, and see -- 
R:  -- on the internet it's more -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- more visual, you know?
L:  Yeah, and I think if they -- 
R:  [several inaudible words] 
L:  -- learn 'em while they're young because, um, [MN] basically m- most of the world is information technology.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, a whole -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- lot of things are on computers.  Now, I think they're good for the children to learn but then you look, and well, computers make mistakes also and it -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- takes people to program what the computers -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- need to know.  So, I think -- 
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  -- children should learn 'em on that point also.
R:  Right.
L:  So, when they get older -- 
R:  Technology.
L:  Huh?
R:  Learn -- learn the technology.
L:  Yeah.  So -- so -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- when they get older they'll know how to use them, you know, and know what they're doing instead of being a -- an adult like myself [MN] and going out into this computer generation we're -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- all in, not knowing anything.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It -- it's hard doing that -- that transition, you know?  Where it's lucky --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [several inaudible words] it's eas- -- 'cause I notice kids that were brought up with it more have a much easier time of --
L:  Ye- -- 
R:  -- getting into other, you know -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [MN] things that are related to that but it's, um -- 
L:  Yeah, because I think -- 
R:  -- but it's -- 
L:  -- ah, I think probably --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- the older you are -- 
R:  [COUGH] Oh, excuse me.
L:  -- the harder it is to learn them.
R:  Yeah.  It's almost like, you know, l- learning to drive when you're a lot older than when you were in your teens, you know?  So, it's -- it's, ah -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  It definitely, ah, has an advantage.  But, I -- I know sometimes too it's, um, you know, it's -- it's -- it's sort of a tool but if it gets used, you know, like t- too -- too much -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, where they're just, ah -- that's all they do is computer stuff -- 
L:  It's like it -- yeah, like it replaced the -- 
R:  -- you know, [MN] then it's [MN] -- 
L:  -- television.  Like they say, um -- 
R:  Instead of running outside and -- and playing for a while or something [LAUGH] with a friend, you know, they're like glued to the computer, you know -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- playing t- too many games or something like that.  But -- 
L:  Right.  Too much computer use.
R:  But, it's just, ah -- but, I -- 
L:  So -- 
R:  -- I think it's got it's place, you know, [MN] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with the education --
L:  Ah -- 
R:  -- so it's just -- 
L:  Yeah, I -- 
R:  -- ah -- 
L:  -- I think it's good.  I think that all children really should learn it.
R:  Yeah, 'cause it's -- you know, that -- that's the way the world's shifting, you know?  And it's like you got to kind of keep up with something --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [LAUGH] you know, it's just -- 
L:  You got to keep up with the time.  So -- 
R:  True.  True.  It's -- 
L:  -- I think it's good.  I think it's good to have 'em in the schools and probably -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- even in summer camp and, um, I know that the children use them at the library like, so it's good for them -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- for education but you also have to monitor them -- 
R:  Y- yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, to make sure that, um, you know, to -- to make sure that they're --  
R:  True.
L:  -- safe on them -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- is what you have to do 'cause you have a lot of --  
R:  Yeah, 'cause there's -- there's so much in- invasion, you know?  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Yeah, you have a lot of psychos and things out here so -- 
R:  That's true.
L:  -- I think they're good if they're, um, if they're --  
R:  M- monitored.  Yeah.
L:  -- yeah, if they're being monitored.  If they're being monitored on what they're doing.  If the time is monitored 'cause, you know, too much of anything is not good for you.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  So -- 
R:  True.
L:  -- I think it's a really good idea.
R:  True.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  It, ah -- they -- 
L:  And -- 
R:  -- they -- 
L:  -- and the schools 'cause I know when I was going to school they didn't have computers in the schools.
R:  No.  No, I think [LAUGH] even when I went to a business college it was still, um, just doing, you know, the old, ah, carbon paper, you know, [LAUGH] and --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah, that type of thing and -- and -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- typing letters, you know, and stuff and there was no doing it on a -- 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- on a computer or on a printer --
L:  So now everything is -- 
R:  -- and things like that.  [MN] 
L:  -- basically transferred to computer and they -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- need people to program 'em the way they, you know -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- they need 'em.  But -- but I also think, you know, that they -- they did take away, um, people's jobs too because -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- like when you try to read something, everything is basically automated.  You know what I mean?
R:  Mm.
L:  Mm.
R:  [MN] Right.
L:  And so -- 
R:  It's true.
L:  That's -- that's how that goes.  So -- 
R:  Yeah.  And it -- it -- 
L:  -- there's pros -- 
R:  -- and it does open up more jobs for 'em -- 
L:  So, there's -- 
R:  -- you know?
L:  Yeah, so there's pros and --
R:  [several inaudible words] 
L:  -- cons to it on both sides.  You know what I mean?
R:  True.  True.  [several inaudible words] --
L:  So -- 
R:  Everything --
L:  Ah -- 
R:  -- is -- as long as there's some balance, you know, it's just -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I guess it comes out okay -- 
L:  Yeah.  So, I think it's a pretty good idea.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like you said -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a- -- as long as it's monitored -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and as long as there's some balance and as long as the children enjoy it, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause over exposure, like you said, could be bad also.
R:  True.
L:  So, that's -- 
R:  It's just [LAUGH] -- 
L:  -- not a good thing either.
R:  Yeah.  No, I -- I -- I quite agree 'cause it's just, um -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it, ah -- 
L:  'Cause -- 
R:  -- everything's got it's advantages and disadvantages --
L:  Yeah, it sure does.
R:  -- it's just a matter of keeping, you know, [several inaudible words] --  
L:  Oh, well, that's with everything and I think especially computers.
R:  Mm.
L:  It all depends on what you're doing with 'em and how you plan on doing it, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  But, I think it's good to teach your children early and, ah -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- so that they know especially the dangers, number one, and then as they get older and go out -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- into the world then they'll already have that knowledge instead of l- like once -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- they graduate school having to learn it, you know?  By the time -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- they graduate, if they learn it early -- 
R:  True.
L:  -- they'll already know what they're doing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, that's -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the really good advantage of it also.
R:  Yeah, and the fact that they can have, you know, something at home that way to access.  You know -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- having a -- a home computer then they can go ahead and get extra --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- study in there, you know, [LAUGH] in- --
L:  Yeah, so -- 
R:  -- instead of having to go to the library -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- have to be supervised over there to -- you know, then you can kind of supervise them and if --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they look at --
L:  And yeah, so they can -- 
R:  -- encyclopedia things on the -- 
L:  -- like, yeah, for homework -- 
R:  -- on the net. 
L:  -- assignments and things like that.
R:  Right.
L:  They can go on line and you know, and -- 
R:  True.
L:  -- download or downgrade or high -- whatever you call it and get -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the information that they need [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  Or type up a paper and --
L:  Yeah, or print it out, yeah.
R:  -- get it printed out right there, you know?  Yeah.  True.
L:  And, ah, so, yeah, I do think it's a really good idea for computers in school.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  For the educational --
L:  Yeah, so -- 
R:  -- part of it it's just, ah -- 
L:  Yeah, for educational -- 
R:  -- you can hardly beat that.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- basis and also, ah, you know, like I say for preschoolers learning the visual -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- [several inaudible words] it might even help 'em learn more than just regular books and -- and -- and, ah, like we learned it with just regular -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- books and things, like that, that might 'em learn a bit more and learn a little better.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, 'cause it's probably more -- more visual -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, which you tend to remember more than just a lot of words and a lot of sentences --
L:  Yeah.  They can -- 
R:  -- and, you know? 
L:  -- remember it more and I think they probably -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- can identify it better also -- 
R:  [MN] True.
L:  -- by seeing it, you know?  And I think -- 
R:  Yeah.  Right.
L:  -- it's probably -- it's probably, um, you know, it -- I bet -- I bet it holds their attention a lot better too. 
R:  Ah, yeah.  Yeah, I think so too 'cause --
L:  Yeah, 'cause it's like -- 
R:  -- it's just, um -- 
L:  -- it's like fascinating to 'em.
R:  Yeah, it's more like looking at a little movie or something, [LAUGH] you know -- 
L:  Yeah, exactly. 
R:  -- instead of just, ah -- 
L:  I believe -- I -- I think they would sit -- 
R:  True. 
L:  -- still and pay attention more -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- for a -- for, ah, something on a computer -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- than they would -- 
R:  Seeing a -- seeing a screen.
L:  -- for -- you know, sitting there with someone reading them a book 'cause after a while they start -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- getting distracted and restless.
R:  Yeah, their -- their attention span is -- is much less than -- 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I -- I've noticed that -- with the difference when you read --  
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  -- um, stories, you know, they -- when they -- they know the story and want to read the story but somewhere along the line they start getting bored and their attention span starts to go off and -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, so -- 
R:  True.  True.  The same as if they were watching something on TV.  You --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- know, that's got their attention much more than if you were just sitting their talking, you know?  [LAUGH]  
L:  Right.  Right.  Yeah, I -- 
R:  So -- 
L:  -- understand what you're saying.
R:  -- um, you do get more of the -- 
L:  So -- 
R:  -- the visual and that really seems to help it quite a bit, I think making it -- t- two fold, you know?
L:  Yeah, so basically it is a pretty good idea.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think it's got, ah -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- probably --
L:  So -- 
R:  -- probably more advantages than [LAUGH] -- than the disadvantages --
L:  Yeah, I think so.
R:  -- as far as the education -- 
L:  Yeah.  So, where -- 
R:  -- how far as it goes.
L:  -- where are you calling from?
R:  Ah, southern California.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm in p- -- um, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
R:  Ah.  [MN] Well -- 
L:  How's the weather out there?
R:  Dreary.  [LAUGH] --
L:  Is it?
R:  Yesterday we had sunshine but today it's been foggy and -- and overcast all day --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- which is unusual for California where it's just --  
L:  Well, this is the first sunshine that we've had out here -- 
R:  [LAUGH] --
L:  -- in a long time.
R:  Yeah, I'd say so when we don't have it here.  I -- I talked to somebody in Texas and they get it over there and I go, "Oh, you've got our sunshine" you know?
L:  Right.
R:  So, it seems to --
L:  What are you doing?
R:  -- drift.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well -- 
R:  Well -- 
L:  -- I did.  I didn't know what you were doing? 
R:  Oh, gosh.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Will you hold on?
R:  So [MN] -- okay.  [MN] 
L:  [NOISE] Hello.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Sorry about that -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
