R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  My name's Leigh.
L:  Hi Leigh. I'm Leah.
R:  Hi. [LAUGH]
L:  Hi.
R:  Okay.  The topic of the day is family?
L:  Family.  Yes.
R:  Okay.  I -- I guess -- do you wanna start?
L:  Okay.  Well, I live by myself and my family is my two little dogs.
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, but actually, I moved to this town last year because my brother and sister in law were having a baby and I moved here just a m- -- a few weeks before the baby was born and --
R:  Where -- now, where is that?
L:  Tucson.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And, um, where are you?
R:  I'm in, ah, Tennessee.
L:  Oh.
R:  Hendersonville, Tennessee.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I don't know if you know the area but --
L:  No.
R:  -- it's near Nashville.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Actually, I moved here for family too.
L:  Did you?
R:  I'm originally from New Jersey.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I have family there too but, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  My nephew moved down here and then his mother, my sister, moved after him and so then I followed them. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, that's nice.
R:  We're, kind of, all moving down. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Originally, I came from California.  The rest of my brothers and my parents are there.
R:  So, you're not really too far depending upon where in California.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well --
L:  And, you know, what's neat is, um, this is my parents' first grandchild.  She's been long awaited.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And she, um -- so, my grandparents -- I mean, my parents and me bought this house together so that they have a place to stay --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- when they come to visit their grandchild.
R:  Hm.
L:  And so, it worked out great for me.  I have a house.
R:  Yeah.
L:  A yard for my dogs and --
R:  Yeah.  So, basically, you just live there by yourself and then they -- whenever they come, they have a place to stay?
L:  Um, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  They come every few months or so.
R:  Well, that's a good investment.  You know?
L:  And then I -- I'm a nanny to my niece.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I -- I see her every day and we have fun together and it's, like, as close as I could get to having a baby of my own.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that's pretty wonderful.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't have any -- I don't really have any family.  I mean, no kids or husband or anything either.
L:  Uh- --
R:  My two sisters lived -- live here so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I have them here.  They're, kinda like -- they're, kinda like, my best friends, you know?  We s- -- we talk every day almost and --
L:  Yeah.  That's wonderful.
R:  With one or the other, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um -- and then, you know, they're both married with kids.  So, they have their families here.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, so it's, kind of, a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, it's not a bad group of people, you know?
L:  Yeah.  When I was growing up --
R:  A- --
L:  -- um, it was me and my three brothers and we just -- I was so happy with them.  I -- I just loved my family then an- -- a- -- I couldn't imagine living without them.  I -- when I think about --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- growing up, I would cry.  But, um, I'm really close with my brothers and --
R:  Now, are they --
L:  I --
R:  -- married with kids also?
L:  Um, well, my youngest one's just had a baby two months ago.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's the one that lives where you are, right?
L:  Um, no.  Back in California.
R:  Oh.
L:  But -- but this one with -- with, um, the one year old, sh- -- um, they're gonna have another baby -- she's pregnant again.  So, I'll have two to take care of.
R:  Mm. [LAUGH]
L:  Um, I was married for a while and I was sure I was gonna have children but we talked about it and it was our intention and --
R:  Yeah.  It just didn't work out?
L:  Then, um, he became an alcoholic and --
R:  Oh, that's too bad.
L:  -- I just knew he wouldn't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- be a good father and I'm --
R:  That's --
L:  I was, kinda, proud that I didn't but --
R:  Huh.  That's too bad.
L:  -- then, after we got divorced, I was really mad that I didn't have any -- at least I could a had a baby. [LAUGH]
R:  Well --
L:  But, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, that was, like, tragedy in my life but --
R:  Now, is it --
L:  M- --
R:  Are you too old to have kids now?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  So, that's done, right?
L:  Yeah.  Well, and I've been sick.  I've b- -- I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm on disability now.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So -- so, I'm really lucky now that, you know, I'm just a -- an -- a mile away from my niece and --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  But --
R:  That's funny, 'cause I'm, kind of, the same -- in the same -- similar position.  I'm too old -- really, too old to have kids now.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I never had them but I -- I, kinda, never -- I wanted them but I didn't want them.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I, kinda, really -- I guess I really didn't want them because I never really could afford to have kids and I was never married.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, but now that, you know, I'm past the point of being able to have them, you wonder what it would've been like to have --
L:  Right.
R:  -- grown kids at this point.  Now, you'd have, really, friends, you know?
L:  Oh, I really had that baby hunger.  I was just longing for a baby so bad.
R:  Mm.
L:  It was --
R:  You never thought about adopting one or ...?
L:  I did.  I did.  Um, but I realized that -- especially since I'm sick -- I'm on --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- disability that --
R:  Yeah.  Well --
L:  I --
R:  -- at this point now you --
L:  I'm not gonna --
R:  You know?
L:  -- do it without a partner.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's, kinda, how I always felt, you know?
L:  Yeah.  And I'm so happy being alone now that, ah, [LAUGH] I'm gonna guard this.
R:  [LAUGH] You're gonna guard your --
L:  A- --
R:  -- privacy now you mean?  Like, your --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Your --
L:  You know --
R:  -- independence?
L:  My independence.
R:  Yes.
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]
R:  That's it.  That's -- see, that's another thing too, I feel like -- people say, "How come you never got married?"  N- -- and on the one hand you -- you know, I would like to if it's right.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But yet, I'm not gonna do it just, you know, not to be alone.
L:  Don't ever compromise yourself.  Yeah.
R:  Y- -- right.  And then in -- like, on a strong day, I'm, like, "Oh, it's great just being on your own".  You don't even think about it.  But, you know, on a lonely day, you, kinda, wish, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there was somebody around but --
L:  Yeah.  Same.
R:  You know?  It would --
L:  You know?
R:  -- have to be the right person.  That's -- that's the only thing, you know?
L:  Absolutely.  Yeah.
R:  So -- so, I'm glad I have my sisters and stuff here just to --
L:  Yeah.  That's --
R:  And I have -- and their husbands are good.  They're --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, they'll do stuff for me or whatever if I need things done, like, that a man has to do.
L:  So, that's wonderful.
R:  You know?
L:  Do you have any pets?
R:  No, I don't.
L:  Oh.
R:  I, um -- I used to work for Verizon.  Um, ah, you know the guy on TV that goes, "Can you hear me now?"
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  That's -- that's what I did.  I drove.  So, I was driving all the time and I would -- stayed in a hotel every night.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I just got laid off two weeks ago.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  But -- I know.  But, um --
L:  Well, now you can have pet.
R:  But so, I never really could have a pet 'cause I was never home, you know?  I was always --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- out, um, on the road so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I couldn't take the pet and -- the dog in car or whatever.  So, I could never have a pet and ...  But I always --
L:  Ah --
R:  I like dogs.  I'd like to get a dog.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, I just love my dogs.
R:  Yeah.  What kind of dogs do you have?
L:  I have an Italian Greyhound --
R:  Oh.
L:  And he's, you know, like a -- a toy Greyhound.
R:  They're pretty.
L:  Oh, he's so nice and he's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  He always cuddles up under the covers with me every night.
R:  Hm.  Are they smart dogs?
L:  Very smart.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh.  He's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- awesome.  And I do agil- --
R:  And what's the other one?
L:  -- agility with them.
R:  What's the other dog?
L:  The other dog's a m- -- a toy Manchester Terrier.
R:  [MN] I used to have one of them.
L:  Did you?
R:  Yes.  That was our pet gro- -- when I was growing up.
L:  Oh.
R:  Actually, I -- it was a miniature Manchester Terrier.  I don't know if there's --
L:  Well, yeah.  I think it's gotta be the same thing.  There's the standard and th- then there's the small one.
R:  Okay.  Yeah.  It looked like a little reindeer.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Except it had big ears and [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, looked like a little reindeer.
L:  I don't know.  People --
R:  That's what we used to call it anyway. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  Mine looks, kinda, like a Doberman.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.
L:  But -- yeah.
R:  But it's small, right?
L:  Right.
R:  A little brown dog?
L:  Oh, yeah.  Very small.
R:  And they used --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to be, um, rat catchers -- mice catch- -- m- -- catchers.
L:  Yes.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Buffy.
L:  And they're, ah --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Her name -- her name was Lady Buffington. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?
R:  We called her Buffy.
L:  Did you get her as a puppy?
R:  Yes.  Mhm.
L:  Was she playful when she was a puppy?
R:  Um, we were really little so --
L:  Oh.  Uh-huh.
R:  I think she was.  Yeah.  Because that's why we got he, you know?
L:  Yeah.  'Cause my --
R:  We just got her because there's four kids and we -- we just wanted a little dog that we could play with.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And we just tortured that dog. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  Not intentionally but --
L:  Well, this dog, I got her when she was six years old.  I just got her last year.
R:  Oh.  They're good dogs.
L:  I adopted her.  Yeah.  And I got her because I wanted another dog to play with my Italian Greyhound.  He's --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah
L:  He's two years old and he's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just so playful.  I was feeling guilty.  In the evenings he would be running around trying to get me to play with him.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I wanted a d- -- another dog for him and [SIGH] well, I was looking for another Italian Greyhound but it's -- then they told me about this Manchester that needed a home and --
R:  And they get along?
L:  Um, they do except she's so serious.  She's not [LAUGH] at all playful and he --
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  But he --
R:  How old's the Greyhound?
L:  The Greyhound's two but the --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- Manchester's six.
R:  That's why.
L:  Yeah.  She's like an old grandma dog.
R:  Yeah.  She's -- she's already halfway, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- through her life.
L:  And I think they're a serious -- more serious dog too.
R:  Hm.
L:  'Cause, like, the Greyhounds are goofy. [LAUGH]
R:  I guess, you know, now that you mention it, yeah.  It's -- yeah.  The dog was not playful on it's own.  It was -- we just --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  We played with it all the time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  She used to pull as around the room by our socks.
L:  Well, that's interesting you --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- had a Manchester too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I've never known anybody else that had one.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Me neither.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's funny.  Now, my sister -- the one sister -- um, has three Border Collies and a ... [MN] the other one ... a Lab -- a black Lab.
L:  Ah.
R:  And --
L:  Border Collies are energetic.
R:  Yes.  Very much so. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]
R:  And they're all, you know, purebreds.  They were raised -- they were planning to raise them.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, but they never did.  But, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  But they just kept getting more and [LAUGH] more dogs. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then my one other sister took one of the Border Collie puppies so she's got a Border Collie too.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, my nephew has a black lab.  Um, so, there's like, one, two, thr- -- we've about four or five -- six dogs in the family.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Right here.  My other nephew has, um ... what the heck kind of dog does he have?  I don't know.  Just some really big -- it's a big dog.  Big --
L:  Like --
R:  -- big dog.
L:  Like a Great Dane?
R:  N- -- it's about that size but it's not a Great Dane.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Anyway, this dog has a heart murmur.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, they decide that they need another dog to play with this dog.  They get another dog -- same kind of dog --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and it's got, um, like, some kind of cancer.  Bone cancer or something.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  I know.  Isn't that weird?
L:  That's horrible.
R:  I know.  Two dogs, same kind of dogs, and they're both -- they're both just gonna die, you know?
L:  Oh, how sad.
R:  I mean, they really can't do much for them.
L:  Yeah.  Well, at least --
R:  Y- --
L:  -- they have each other w- -- for right now.
R:  I know.  Isn't that just weird though?
L:  Yeah.  Bad luck.
R:  Yeah.  I couldn't believe it when they told me that.
L:  Oh.
R:  But anyway.  So, the -- so, every Christmas, you know, everybody gets together --
