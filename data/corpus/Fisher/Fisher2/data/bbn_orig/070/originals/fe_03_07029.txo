R:  Hi.  Ah, my name is Eve.  Are you there?
L:  Yes, my name's Eddie.
R:  Hi.  Are you in --
L:  Hi.
R:  -- Philadelphia?
L:  Yes.
R:  Me too.  We're supposed to talk about family.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Not my favorite subject.
L:  Well, to me family is people that are there for you when you need them --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and if you ha- -- if you need someone to talk to, you can always talk to your family --
R:  Uh-huh.  So, you don't mean necessarily birth family?
L:  No.
R:  Ah --
L:  Because I don't have a birth family right now.
R:  You don't have a birth family?  I'm sorry to hear that.  But I can understand.  Um, [LIPSMACK] well, I sort of feel the same way.  I talked to my friends and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and my ah actual g- genetic family I have no contact with, so I don't have a [LAUGH] --
L:  Me neither.
R:  -- funny that they gave us that topic.
L:  [MN]  Yeah.
R:  What'd you say your name is again?  I'm sorry, I forgot it.
L:  That's all right.  Eddie.  And you're Eve, right?
R:  Eddie.  Right.  Yeah.  Um, well I once had um a mother and father and ah both of them are dead now a- --
L:  Sorry to hear that.
R:  -- well, thanks.  But it's been -- it's been so long the -- it's okay.  And I had one brother older than me who died about ten years ago --
L:  [NOISE] Sorry.
R:  -- my -- my mother kept the family together.  After my father died my mother saw to it that my brother and I kept in touch and ah -- and I kept in touch with his ah wife and children but then -- then my father di- -- then my brother died and that was the end of it --
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- so, I have no contact with them.  But I do have friends.
L:  That's good.
R:  How about you?
L:  [SIGH] I could use more friends [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah [LAUGH] me too.
L:  'Cause I don't got no family, so ...
R:  Did you once have a family?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Did they ah --
L:  Disowned me, so --
R:  Disowned you?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So you ah you saw the ad in the PGN, I guess.
L:  Yes.
R:  Me too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm really s- -- I'm really so sorry to hear that, that was -- that's ah -- that's really --
L:  They were somewhat abusive anyway, so [MN].
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Calling me stupid --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- fat.  So ...
R:  Uh-huh.  Have you ever tried --
L:  That's not a family.  [LAUGH]
R:  Huh?
L:  That's not a family.
R:  Right.
L:  The parents shouldn't be calling you names [SIGH].
R:  Right.  Have you ever tried to ah reestablish any kind of contact with them, see if they could have -- have grown up?
L:  [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] I don't have their phone number.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And I don't remember the address.
R:  Uh-huh.  I --
L:  I just know they live in Ridley Park [LAUGH].
R:  Where's Ridley Park?
L:  It's outside of Pennsylvan- -- outside of Philadelphia.
R:  Oh.
L:  Ah, somewhere in the suburbs.
R:  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK] Well, sounds like --
L:  Near Swarthmore[?].
R:  Huh?
L:  Near Swarthmore.
R:  Uh-huh.  People from the Swarthmore area should be educated enough to have ah accepted you for h- -- h- -- who you are?
L:  I know, but they lived in Philadelphia for thirty years, so --
R:  [LAUGH]  Well, I -- I don't m- -- I'm not laughing at you, I'm laughing with you.  I mean, I'm laughing because I oh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's -- it's a rotten situation.  So, what do you -- I -- I guess have to stay on the topic of family?
L:  Yeah, we do.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Hm.
L:  Ah [LIPSMACK] well, [SIGH] for me, my friends are my family, so [LIPSMACK] yeah.
R:  Well, tell -- tell me about your family friends.
L:  Well, my family is my depression group I go to every Wednesday --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I -- it's only been five weeks, but [LIPSMACK] I was in a depression group before, I was there for a year --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and that was my family --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I got a -- now I'm starting on another one --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I had family with church, we have a depression group there on a Wednesday night --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That's my family now.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH] Plus I have one f- -- one friend I talk to [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.  Well, groups are wonderful things.  I guess -- I guess my groups have been my friends too.  I used to be in an ACOA group.  Ah --
L:  What's that?
R:  Adult children of alcoholics.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Ah, my father was alcoholic and I never really thought much about it till I grew up and all my therapists started saying, "You really need to look at the alcoholic issue in your family" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I did find it a very valuable group.  Um --
L:  My grandmother was an alcoholic.
R:  Your grandmother?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Golly.
L:  She died drinking [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  And smoking [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  She also had cancer from the cigarettes [LAUGH], so --
R:  Oh, boy.  Ah, was that a long time ago, or recently?
L:  That was in eighty three.
R:  Hm.
L:  Eight two, eighty two.
R:  Were you still in touch with her then?
L:  Oh, I didn't like her [LAUGH].
R:  You didn't like her?
L:  She didn't like me either.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  She h- -- she hate me because I was the youngest child.
R:  Mm.
L:  She didn't like the youngest child of all of her children because um --
R:  Uh-huh.  Phew.
L:  She was a real mean wo- -- she was a real mean woman.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm s- -- I'm sorry to hear that.  Well, if she was a mean woman, then I suppose it's not surprising that you're ah was it your -- was it your mother's mother or your father's mother?
L:  My mother's mother.
R:  Well, your fa- -- your mother probably picked up some of her meanness, did she?
L:  [SIGH] She wasn't as bad because she wasn't a drunk [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I was just telling ah -- I was just telling another friend of mine about my mother and father; my father used to ah [SIGH] come home drunk from work and then my mother would start fighting with him and s- -- and scolding him and he'd end up hitting her.  I guess that's a fairly typical alcoholic family story.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Ah -- how old are you?
L:  [SIGH] Ah, thirty five.  I'll be thirty six later this year.
R:  Uh-huh.  Well, I'm seventy.  So, I've had more years to ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to deal with the same crap.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  Um, it was a real relief when I finally decided that I could call it quits with my family and I disowned them and just -- just a few years ago, after my brother died.
L:  Yeah [NOISE].
R:  Ah, I didn't need the abuse from my ah -- my -- my brother and my sister in law had raised their children to despise me and I didn't need that.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Do you have -- ah -- I'd like to talk on some other subject than family [LAUGH].  I'll bet you would too.
L:  Yeah, me, I would, yeah.
R:  Um.  Do you know -- ah, do you have any friends who have families they enjoy?
L:  Ah, no.  Not really.
R:  Yeah.  Ah, I have a ah --
L:  No blood, anyway.
R:  Huh?
L:  Not blood family, no.
R:  Uh-huh.  Um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- mm.  I have um a friend out in the neighborhood where I live um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- who we went to college together many, many years ago and when I moved back to this neighborhood after many years out -- in outer State she ah heard somebody mention my name and said, "Oh, I know that -- I know Eve, we went to college together" --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and she looked me up and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we've been good friends.  She's sort of my family here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But ah she's really into family, she has two sons that she's devoted to and they're devoted to her and one of them has children, so she's -- spends all her time babysitting with the grandchildren and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah it just amazes me that there should be -- that there are any families like that left in the world, where everybody likes everybody.  Ah, I wonder what it would take to ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- make that happen more often?  Do you take anything for your depression?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And does it help?
L:  We're off subject.
R:  Huh?
L:  We're off the subject.
R:  Well, I think that family led to that subject so I'm -- I'm not going to ah [LAUGH] I don't -- I don't see why we shouldn't ah explore where the talking about family leads us to.
L:  I take -- I take four medications.
R:  Four medications?  W- --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, one's for -- one's for depression, the other two are for anxiety and the other one's for sleep.
R:  Wow.  Amytripolene[?] for sleep?  I'm guessing.
L:  W- -- what's that again?
R:  Am- -- ah -- um, amytripolene, I'm trying to think what the ah -- what do you take for sleep --
L:  I just take Benadryl.
R:  Oh, just Benadryl?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's not so bad.  I take ah -- I take Selexa[?], I've been on it for about fifteen years.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Ah, made a big difference to my life.  Does your -- does your medications help you?
L:  [SIGH] Not really.
R:  Ah, do you see a therapist?
L:  Yeah, I see him every Thursday.
R:  And did the therapist suggest you go to the group?
L:  [NOISE] Actually my case manager found it -- found it for me.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Because I'm in a Housing Program.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, if I wasn't here, I'd be homeless.
R:  Oh, I see.  Well, I hope they found you a nice home -- housing.
L:  Yeah, the rent is very low.
R:  Very low?
L:  A hundred and thirty dollars a month.
R:  Wow.
L:  It just went up to
