L:  Hi.  My name is Sylvia.
R:  Hi Sylvia.  My name is Pam.
L:  Okay.  How you doing today?
R:  Fine. How are you?
L:  All right.
R:  That's good.
L:  All right.  I guess our topic is what does [LAUGH] family mean to us?
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]
L:  That's the topic.  Okay. [LAUGH] Well, um, I guess, I could say family just means a sense of, um, someone being there for you.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] loving you.  Um, [SIGH] loving you unconditionally no matter what you do or -- or what goes on they --
R:  Right.
L:  -- are there for you.  Um, [LIPSMACK] just when the world do all, kinda, things or when the world is not, um, there for you, the family will be there.
R:  That's it.
L:  A stable unit.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Doesn't matter how many people are in it -- in it.  It's just, um, some place to -- some people that you can go that love you and -- and it doesn't really mean if they're related or not.
R:  That's it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But --
L:  But it w- -- uh-huh.
R:  But with me, ah, [LIPSMACK] family to me is, ah -- s- -- I come from a big family.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, [LAUGH] it's, like, ah -- there's ten of us.
L:  Oh.
R:  And it's --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- like, five girls and five boys. [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.
R:  And so, basically, ah, some of us -- we're spread out, you know, in -- in different parts of the, ah, um, city.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, even though we're far apart, you know, we try to, um, stay close together.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, whether it be we go visit one another or we, you know, talk on the telephone.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  You know, we sh- -- you know -- you know, growing up with big family like that, you know, we fought all the time, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  But when push comes to shove, you know, you mess with one, you gotta mess --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- with all of us. [LAUGH]
L:  Got everybody to deal with. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's -- yeah.  That's, basically, how we grew up.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, if you fight with one, you got to fight with all of us. [LAUGH] You know?
L:  That's right.
R:  But, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- even though y- -- and, you know, even now, w- -- you know, we're -- b- -- we're trying to be close, you know --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- but -- yeah.  We still fight as a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- family, you know?  We still fight.  We still bicker, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- now and then.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But at the same time, you know, when push comes to shove and one needs something or, you know, someone needs a help, you know, we're always there for 'em.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, no matter what.  You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, you know, family comes first before anybody on the outside.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  Not saying that we won't help somebody on the outside.
L:  Mm.
R:  But, you know, my family c- -- you know, if they need the help first, we got to go to them first.
L:  Got to go to them first.
R:  You know?  That's it.
L:  Well, with --
R:  And definitely, you know, we try -- we try to -- try to stay to close, ah, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because, you know, like you say, when push comes to shove, when there's nobody else --
L:  No one[?] else out there.
R:  You know?  Huh?
L:  Mhm.  I said, when there's no one else out there.  You're right.
R:  That's it.  That's it. You know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, you know, a lotta times, people on the outside's not gonna stick with you like family will stick with you.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  If you come from a r- --
L:  Well, I think --
R:  -- really close knit family, you know, and a- -- sometimes, you know, you got family members that don't care about you and stuff.
L:  Mhm.  That's true.
R:  You know?  But, you know --
L:  I think sometimes we go into the workforce and the, um -- schools and different places, looking for that same, type of, relationship that we --
R:  That's it.
L:  -- grew up in.
R:  That's it.
L:  And we get disappointed because a job is a job and --
R:  That's it.
L:  -- and it's nice to find friends in people but we look at -- oh, um, "Why do you treat me like this?" or whatever --
R:  That's it.
L:  -- but it's not your family --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- where you, kinda, grew up.  It's eight of us, but, ah, I only grew up with my brother because --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- m- -- it's thirteen years between me and the baby.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Well, th- -- n- not the baby but the next group.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it's the same father so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- six of them are growing up together where the two of us --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- grew up together.  So, it's still -- they look to me as, like, oh, the big sister.
R:  That's it.  Yeah.
L:  And it's still, you know, something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you honestly have to give advice to them and -- and, unfortunately, the older brother w- -- I grew up with, um, he still comes to me for advice too so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you, kind of, stuck there, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and that, kind of, thing.  And I know eventually it will change.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, as they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- get older and more -- more ma- mature and stuff.  But, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Definitely.
L:  My g- -- now, my grandmother -- I did not grow up with my grandmother but now that I'm an adult --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- me and her -- you would think she's my mother.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Because we have a rapport and a relationship and you can imagine --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if I'm on my own and there's still six at home, I must've had young parents and I did.
R:  Yeah.  Definitely.
L:  Very young parents.  They --
R:  Yeah.  Definitely.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, me and my grandmother, it's pretty much like daughter --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and a mother.  My mother is, like, two s- -- you know, sisters.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And my, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And my father's young.  You know, very young.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um --
R:  But, you know, it's kinda -- it's, kinda, nice to have that, you know, like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  'Cause, like, with my -- with my son --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- um, 'cause I look young for my age.  You know, everybody --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- says, you know, "Wow, you got a young mom" and --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- my son -- I don't know.  My son don't treat me like -- like grandma.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  He treats me, like, you know, b- -- I'm a teenager, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  'Cause I look so young, you know?
L:  Right.  Mhm.
R:  But still, when push comes to shove, if anybody --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- mess with me --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- my son -- you know? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] He's there. [LAUGH]
R:  He doesn't -- you know? [LAUGH] And, you know --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and -- and a nice thing about it, even though we're all grown --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- my mom is still there and we can --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- still approach her and she --
L:  That's good.
R:  -- you know, she's there through thick and thin, through rain, snow, sleet, whatever, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  If we have a problem or -- or, you know -- now, you know, ain't young -- you know, we were young, we couldn't really talk to our parents.
L:  Right.
R:  But now, it's just, like, you know, um --
L:  You can talk to them like --
R:  -- time change.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Time changes --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- stuff.  Now, you could just talk about anything, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  And so, you know, if we have a problem -- if I need to talk to somebody, you know, ah, my family's always there, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, like, I'm the -- the -- I have sisters that are twins and so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I'm next to them so I'm third in the line.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so, they're like, you know -- they're, like, the leaders, you know?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Because they're the first born.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  So, basically, you know, they -- they got more brain, you know, and scruples, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they know a little more so I, basically, you know, um -- I do go to my youngest sister --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I mostly go to my older sisters because they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they know more and they're, you know -- they're, um, you know -- they're -- basically, they're all in the medical field and so forth, you know?  So --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- except for me.  I chose a different way to go. [LAUGH]
L:  Sure.
R:  I didn't wanna be like the rest of the family [LAUGH] so --
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  I just wanna be different, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, ah, still, you know?  I can -- I can go to them and, um -- especially one of my, um, t- -- sisters th- -- one of the twins, I can --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- go to her more so than the other twin.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  So, I guess, um, because, ah -- I guess, personality wise, I guess.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  So, bas- --
L:  That's so funny because I'm in the medical field. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really?  Yeah.
L:  I -- [LAUGH] yeah.  That is so weird.  Yeah.  But, um --
R:  Well, see my mom, she -- she used to be in the medical field.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And so, ah, just like -- all -- four of the other girls, you know, follow her except for me --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I just [LAUGH] -- I ch- -- I chose a --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- different direction.  I said -- 'cause I can't stand blood and I --
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, I'm, not -- yeah.  I can't deal with that.  So, you know?  And they got a -- a strong constitution.  I don't have it, you know?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm like, "Oh, I'll faint". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know?  So --
L:  So, all the ones in my family, they're, um, [LIPSMACK] creative, ah, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I have a little of that too but i- -- you know, I do more of follow by example type things but they can just draw out of their heads, paint something --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So, do all of this stuff.  I mean, d- -- I have some -- like I said -- creativity in there --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but mostly, mine is gonna be science -- scientific, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  But -- but, like, even my brother, you know?  The brothers -- the boys, they can fix things with their hands without --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Mhm.
L:  -- problems because my dad does that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  He's, like, carpentry and all that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  They have all that creative field and, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  Definitely.
L:  So, I have a son who's, um -- who's also creative.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  He's very creative and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it went to him and, um -- so, he's even looking into, like, architecture and, um --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- stuff like that.
R:  Yeah. Uh-huh.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  Well, I have a --
L:  Um --
R:  I have a brother he has, um, finished school as a carpentry.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so, now he's looking for work in that field.  I have another brother -- my younger brother -- he's a -- ah -- my youngest brother, ah, has a tourist bus company so, you know --
L:  Mm.  They --
R:  -- he tour people, you know, around the city and stuff.
L:  Mm.
R:  And my other brother -- my younger brother -- he does, ah, sheetrock.
L:  Wow.
R:  And so, he likes to get up there on that tall buildings --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- and stuff, you know, and --
L:  And do all of that.
R:  That's it.
L:  Mm.
R:  And my other brother, um -- the one that, um -- I have a brother that does designing in windows so he's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like, a fashion designer.  Ah, he's fabulous --
L:  That's like my sister.
R:  -- in -- in drawing and stuff.
L:  That's my sister.
R:  And, you know?
L:  Mm.
R:  Like, we came from a a- a- artist background too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  And then I got my -- my older brother that -- next to me, he's a musician.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, he plays the --
L:  I don't think we have any musicians in the, you know -- in the immediate family.  My son --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he's getting into -- you know, how they go through phases and stuff all these --
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  -- things that they wanna do but --
