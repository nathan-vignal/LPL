L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  I'm Tiffany.
L:  I'm Janice.  How're you doing Tiffany?
R:  I'm good.  How're you Janice?
L:  All right.  And where are you calling from?
R:  I'm in Burbank, California.
L:  Okay.
R:  How about you?
L:  I'm in north Carolina.
R:  Oh, wow, you're across the country.
L:  Yeah, [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  I used to live in Virginia.  I miss it out there.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yes. 
R:  [LAUGH] [inaudible] too.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  I've never been to California.  I imagine it's nice.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, it's okay.  You know, I prefer the east coast though, to tell you the truth.
L:  Okay.
R:  I liked -- I liked it out there.  You guys are having spring now a- -- 
L:  Oh, yeah -- 
R:  -- just -- 
L:  -- loving it.  Loving it.  Loving -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- every bit of it.  Yeah, but this education thing for school, I think it's better, you know, 'cause the --  
R:  Do -- 
L:  -- kids have so much information right there for them, you know?
R:  So, do you think that computers are helpful?
L:  Yes, I do.
R:  Do you think that, like, all kids should have access to computers and, like, when should it start?
L:  Oh, probably ab- -- [SIGH] oh, I would say -- 
R:  It's hard to know isn't it 'cause -- 
L:  I would say maybe first grade.  No later than second.
R:  Yeah, 'cause it seems the kids like to get on the computer when they're that young and to play and they don't realise that they're learning as -- as they're going.
L:  Exactly and see if they start early on that -- it would continue throughout, you know,  all of their education and there's so much information out there, you know?
R:  I know, and I -- I don't know when you went through school but I sort of remember the -- you know, the only thing that we had when I was in school were sort of slides and, um, old, old films.  [LAUGH] You know what I mean?
L:  Exactly.
R:  The -- like now they can -- yeah, they can get right on and have pictures and graphics and videos and it just seems like it would be so much easier to learn what you had to learn.
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.  I think it would -- it's wonderful that they have the computers in the school.  I'm for it, you know?  And -- 
R:  Yeah.  I wish they had had it when I was a kid.
L:  I do too -- 
R:  In -- 
L:  I do too -- 
R:  -- in fact, ah, do you have a computer in your home?
L:  Yes, I do.
R:  Yeah, I mean, don't -- I mean, I spend so much time on there just l- looking at [MN] things that I'm curious about in the day, you know?
L:  Me too.
R:  I don't -- 
L:  Me too.
R:  -- it's hard to imagine life without the computer.
L:  It is.  It is.  Yep, I'm on there, like, hours at a time just browsing and browsing and I don't, you know, like to go into chat rooms and play games and stuff like that.  I don't like that.  I mean, that's not what I do in there.  You know, I'm just mostly trying to look up information and researching and things like that.  [MN] -- 
R:  Right.  Would you have studied, do you think, computers at all if you had had them when you were going through school?
L:  Studied them?  Mm.
R:  Do you -- you know, like, become a programmer or --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- anything like that?
L:  Mm.  Ah, I don't know.  I guess so because -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I've taken a couple of courses on it, you -- you know, when I was younger in school, like, Cobal and stuff like that and, ah --  
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yes, and a little bit of programing and things like that and so I went to school for word processing so I was able to know a little bit about the computer.  You know, 'cause back then when I was going to school for the computer, we didn't even have a mouse.
R:  [LAUGH] Right.  That's right.
L:  We didn't -- 
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  -- have a mouse.  And so when the mouse came along I was like, "What?  A mouse --" 
R:  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  -- I don't want to use that thing.  I don't need that".  But, now, I couldn't see myself without clicking, clicking, clicking, clicking.  [LAUGH] --" 
R:  Ah, I know, that's true.  It's hard to imagine --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- not having these things isn't it?
L:  Yes, it is.  But, ah -- 
R:  Do you have kids or anything that are in school?
L:  No, I don't.
R:  No, my either.  [MN] --
L:  Mm mm.
R:  It's interesting though because, um, I kind of a- -- I've sort of been interested in home schooling since I -- I've known a few people that have home schooled their kids and their kids are really smart, really sharp.
L:  Yeah -- 
R:  Like -- 
L:  -- home schooling is good and you know what?  You could, um, [MN] possibly, you know, like tutor people from home over the internet -- 
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- like if you wanted a teaching job 'cause that's basically what I'm interested in, working from home.  Like they have this, ah, virtual call center stuff that they have where you can just take calls and answer questions, you know, like customer service reps -- 
R:  Right.  Right. 
L:  -- right from home.
R:  Yeah.  That's really smart.
L:  Mhm.  And so really I think it's wonderful that the kids have the computers.
R:  Yeah, and I was -- 
L:  And so -- 
R:  -- I think and it would be -- it would make, um, home schooling so much easier --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you know, because if you could buy sort of like certain programs that taught certain levels of things, you know you could sort of set up a schedule that your child had to go through on the computer and --
L:  Yeah, and the -- 
R:  -- you could -- 
L:  -- government has a design where they'll give you so much money [MN] to, ah, teachers.
R:  Home school?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah exac- -- 
R:  Oh, I didn't realise that.
L:  Yeah.  You can -- you can look that up.  And, ah, I just feel [MN] sorry for the children that don't have computers in their schools.  The less fortunate children, you know?
R:  I know.  Ah, that's really no excuse nowadays that they shouldn't have e- --
L:  I know.
R:  -- every -- everybody shouldn't have a computer.  I mean -- 
L:  And it's -- and somebody on -- on the board of education or something, that could write a grant for the kids to get a computer or something in their schools because I just couldn't see the kids not having 'em.
R:  Exactly and these computer companies they have -- their profits are so big anyway.  They should -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you know, the government should give them a tax break if they donate -- 
L:  Mm.  Right.
R:  -- you know, more and more computers to schools.
L:  Exactly, 'cause they're --  
R:  'Cause, I mean, they got -- and [several inaudible words] refurbish computers.  People upgrade their computers every year and so you have --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- tons of old computers going back onto the streets.  Those could go into schools too.
L:  So, what's your email address?  I'll write you.
R:  [LAUGH] Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's showbiz --
L:  [LAUGH] Showbiz -- 
R:  -- DC -- 'cause that's where I used to live at AOL.
L:  DC?
R:  DC as in District of Columbia.
L:  Mm.  At AOL.  So, that's S.H.O.W.B.I.Z. -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  -- DC at AOL -- 
R:  Showbiz DC at AOL.
L:  Okay.  Great -- 
R:  That -- 
L:  -- and if you see China doll, that's me.
R:  That's great.
L:  [MN] China doll at Yahoo.  Yeah.   Yeah -- 
R:  What are you?  Canada at Yahoo you said?
L:  China.  China -- 
R:  What, ah, can you spell it?
L:  C. -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- H.I. -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- N.A. China.
R:  Oh, China.  Oh --
L:  China doll.
R:  Is that your name?
L:  No, no.
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] --
L:  China doll.
R:  China doll at Yahoo.
L:  Mhm.  Well -- 
R:  Oh, that's a good one.
L:  -- actually it's China doll fifty seven oh two at Yahoo.
R:  Oh, fifty seven oh two.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh --
L:  Someone -- 
R:  -- they must have -- 
L:  -- already had China doll.
R:  I was going to say someone already must have had china doll, huh?
L:  Mhm.  Everybody -- 
R:  That's funny.
L:  -- wants to be a China doll.  [LAUGH] Yeah --  
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's right.
L:  Ah -- 
R:  So, how many of these phone calls have you done yet?  Have you --
L:  This is my -- 
R:  -- done all --  
L:  -- third one.
R:  Oh, it is?
L:  Yes.
R:  So, this is it.
L:  This is it -- 
R:  You're done.
L:  I'm done.
R:  Good for you.  This is my second one.
L:  Okay.  Okay.
R:  Ah --
L:  And I -- 
R:  -- I know, this'd be a good job wouldn't it?  I could do this.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Oh, but, girl the stuff that's out there on the computer to do.  [MN] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] I know.
L:  -- there's just too much information.  Maybe I'll email you some sites.
R:  Oh, that'd be great.
L:  Mhm.  This is -- 
R:  That's -- 
L:  -- [MN]
R:  -- that's so funny.
L:  Mhm.  So, I don't think I'm going to have any children.  So, but I have a lot --  
R:  Oh, really?
L:  No.  Yeah.  Mm.
R:  Do you not want children or just -- 
L:  No, I don't.  It's just, ah, something -- I have nieces and nephews.  I love children but I don't -- 
R:  Oh, and that's enough -- that's enough for you?
L:  Right.  I -- I love children.  I do, I do, I do.  I'm just glad that they do have the computers because they like to play those Playstation games a lot.
R:  Right.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I guess that's the danger with kids and computers is that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they're going to sort of play games and not learn anything.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  What about -- what do you think about plagiarizing?  Like, do you think it makes it easier for kids to plagiarize 'cause they have access to computers and when they write their reports and stuff they can just [MN] find it on the internet and copy it instead of +having to create their own thing?
L:  No, I don't like that part.
R:  Yeah.
L:  No, 'cause then -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when they get older they're not going to know how to be creative.
R:  Right.  I wonder if there's a way of -- it's so hard to tell sometimes, you know?
L:  Mm.  The teachers and the professors know though.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They know.  For some -- 
R:  Hopefully -- 
L:  -- reason they know.
R:  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Because of the -- the way that it's worded and the words that are used and things like that --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- and they know this person's IQ -- 
R:  [MN]  
L:  -- when it's test time and stuff like that.
R:  Right.
L:  They can tell.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  That's --
L:  They can --  
R:  -- so funny. 
L:  tell.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, God.
L:  But, yeah, I think it's a good thing to have it in the -- in the school and as early on as maybe the second grade.
R:  Yeah, I think you're right.  I think at least -- I mean, I know that, um, my nephews and nieces were playing computer games when they were -- were like four they were sitting at the computer playing --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you know -- the -- the -- the games that they make for kids that are sort of smart but help -- help them learn something, you know?
L:  Mm.  Ah, right.
R:  Even if it's just recognizing colors or -- 
L:  A.B.C.s, one two threes and adding -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- them.  Subtracting.  'Cause -- 
R:  Exactly. 
L:  -- my nephew, he has a hard time with his maths and I'm trying to teach him.  You know, he's -- he's like six years old and if he's adding two numbers, he's counting both the numbers on his fingers and I'm like, "No, you already have one number.  Just add to that". 
R:  [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, that's so funny.
L:  Yeah, you know?
R:  He can't --
L:  I was -- 
R:  -- wrap his brain around it really.
L:  No.  They're young -- 
R:  Oh, that's -- 
L:  -- and stuff.
R:  -- so cute.
L:  Mhm.  And he gets -- and so he -- he makes his little lines and then he counts the lines.  I say, "Well, I'd rather see you [MN] make your lines and then add your little" -- he, like -- they look like ones all over the page.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  -- and he'll count those.  I said, "Oh, God, he needs help".  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
