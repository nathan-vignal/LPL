R:  Lisa.
L:  Hi.  This is Carla.
R:  Hi Carla.  This is Lisa.
L:  Lisa? [NOISE]
R:  Yes.
L:  Ah, where are you, ah, calling from?
R:  Seattle, Washington.
L:  Oh.  Me too. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, you are?
L:  Yes.
R:  [LAUGH] W- --
L:  Okay.
R:  I guess I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  This is a really heavy topic.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I assume it's because of the Martha Stewart thing.
L:  Oh, probably.  'Cause that was in the paper today.
R:  Right.  Well, I don't know. [LAUGH] I do hair for --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a living and, ah, [inaudible] and -- and work in a small, like, a salon.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, corporate world, you know, I only hear it from people that come in to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the salon.
L:  Right.
R:  So, affecting me personally --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, I guess --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't know how it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- trickles down to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- my --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Maybe the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- economy as far as --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- how it --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- will affect me.
L:  Maybe, people having money to come get their hair done. [LAUGH]
R:  That could --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- be it too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, so, a- -- what do you do?
L:  I work, um -- I'm in research at Fred Hutch.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, of course, we're affected by when people don't have a lot of money [NOISE] contributions --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to keep our research going.
R:  Right.
L:  And I also work at the Seattle Opera House and we've definitely been affected by people's losses in the stock market [NOISE] and having money to contribute to the arts.  So --
R:  Well, what d- --
L:  -- we're, kinda, both dependent on [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  Not --
R:  So --
L:  -- directly.  I don't work at a [NOISE] big corporation but [NOISE] --
R:  Right.
L:  But it -- I -- it is trickling down and, of course, the whole region's been affected by Boeing.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I feel that way too.  I just wonder what, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what we -- what the government could do about it?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I guess I don't -- I'm not think- -- I've never thought that far into it.
L:  It's really a touchy subject because our country's always believed in a [inaudible] share economy --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- where people do as well as they can do.
R:  Right.
L:  But maybe that's not such a good [LAUGH] thing anymore.  Maybe we need to -- oh, wow.  Yeah. [NOISE] 'Cause --
R:  I'm amazed.  I -- I am amazed that white --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- collar criminals --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- get a lot more --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- penalties than blue -- like, criminals --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that will commit murder or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, w- when I look at --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- even the press on something like with -- with --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- millionaires that create -- you know, that create these problems for themselves.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I don't know if it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- true or not.  Or I look at somebody that's, you know -- even in the media of that man who killed his wife or they think he killed his wife -- I'm amazed at the publicity and the attention for it would be almost equal.
L:  Yes.
R:  I -- I just -- I feel [LAUGH] like they've already prosecuted Martha --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Stewart for this --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and we don't even know any -- I haven't heard any facts.
L:  No.  I haven't either.
R:  And --
L:  I don't know what the facts of the case are --
R:  Right here and --
L:  -- but you hear Jay Leno and everybody else --
R:  Right.  I -- and I guess I feel like it's, you know, linked this blue collar crime right into -- right into, you know, really severe criminal --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- activity and the punishment is sometimes even worse.  Like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they're saying thirty years and, you know --
L:  For, like, t- tax fraud or something?
R:  Yeah.  And s- -- um, three million dollar fines and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I guess I, um -- I guess I haven't really thought about the big picture, how it affects, you know, everybody in the community but I can't imagine what it could be that would be worse than some of the other, like, major crimes that are [LAUGH] committed.  I guess I --
L:  Right.  Like --
R:  If they're playing with their money like that I, you know -- I -- I guess I feel -- I'm sorry, my phone's beeping --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  I hope it'll last for the [LAUGH] call but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I guess I don't, um -- I guess I get concerned about, um, you know, it has to be a bigger picture when it -- with the government and it -- like, it has to be very political and I just wonder, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what, kinda, example we're setting for people when we --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- prosecute people for these type a crimes and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- really set a high standard --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on what --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, I -- I guess I don't -- I don't feel like that's the number reason why the economy would be bad.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I think --
R:  I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think it, sometimes, plays off -- you know, we just spent, you know, I don't know how many millions or billions on our war --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that I don't even know what --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- came out of it and, you know, we're putting all this --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- attention on some, kind of, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- sell out of stock, you know, and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- saying, "Okay, that's the -- one of the reasons --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- why our eco- --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Even the questions that she had said at the beginning of the cord- -- the recording had said --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, it has a big -- what's the government gonna do to help because of the economy's so low because of these people?  And I'm not thinking that's the number one reason [LAUGH] why it's affecting me.
L:  No.  I think that -- I think we expect, maybe, higher standards from people in those positions.
R:  Maybe so.
L:  You know?  And so there's a violation of trust.
R:  Yeah.  That's true.
L:  You, kind of, expect the criminal to be a criminal.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, you have the stereotype of a -- a bank robber or, you know, a murderer or something like that.
R:  Right.
L:  But [NOISE] [SIGH] --
R:  I agree.
L:  You know, then again, if those guys do what they did with Enron and [NOISE] everybody loses their jobs, [NOISE] you know, they -- they've caused a lotta damage to people's lives too.
R:  Right.  I can see that.  I guess I've not, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I'm not sure what the whole cause and effect.  I've never thought into it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't play the stock market.  I don't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know -- I --
L:  I don't have that kind of money so it's --
R:  Yeah.  I'd -- I -- I -- so I've never --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I've -- I figure if people are investing that many sums of money and they --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- lose that much money, it's a risk of -- they take.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, they're --
L:  It's legal gambling.
R:  It is.  And I, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Insider trading and dumping --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the stocks, I don't know, you know -- I -- I would assume --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Just my husband --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- has invested in stocks and he has --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- set his stocks at a, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if it goes below this point then sell 'em all.
L:  Right.  So, he doesn't lose.
R:  And that's it.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I -- I don't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know -- I don't know enough about it that would mean --
L:  [NOISE] Well, it -- it's concerned me enough that I have not invested in a pension fund.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Because I know quite a few people who are [NOISE] retirement age that I work with who've lost [NOISE] all their money because --
R:  See, now I --
L:  -- they had all their retirement in, you know, pension funds they'd invested in the stock market.
R:  Isn't that amazing?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I've had several clients that have lost, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- hundreds of thousands of dollars --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in that and -- and just the retirement pension fund and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm overwhelmed by that.  It's --
L:  And I'm not talking about rich people.  I'm talking about people who've worked all their lives. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  I --
L:  And they were --
R:  To --
L:  -- looking forward to retiring and now they're working again.
R:  Yup.  And I, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  During the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I'm thirty five and so during, you know, my time in my --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- adult- --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- -hood and raised -- having -- starting a family, it was just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- booming.  I mean --
L:  Right.
R:  -- we g- -- we were m- -- I -- in my profession --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I was making money left and right.  My husband --
L:  Oh, sure.
R:  -- was.  We were able to get into a really great house and I have three little girls --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and the thing is --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- is that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's hard to believe --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, where we're at now.  It's h- -- it's still hard for us to manage our money because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we're so not used to being in a -- in a time where we can't just spend money on --
L:  Well --
R:  -- on everything and anything.
L:  And I think a lot of us were b- -- raised with the expectation to do better than our parents.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  But things are just different.  It used to be if you went to college and you worked hard or whatever profession you were in, you know, if you worked hard and you did a good job, you would be successful.
R:  Right.
L:  And now, it seems like it's out of our hands.
R:  It is.  And I -- I do feel pretty secure in my job because of just what I do.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it's a, um, very --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's been around for twenty years and so we're a very up and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- coming but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- already there kind of business.
L:  Right.
R:  So, we're much established and -- and, um, lucky, people need haircuts. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, sure.
R:  We're here to give haircuts. [LAUGH]
L:  It's something that people can afford to do that gives them a boost and --
R:  Right.
L:  And [NOISE] I know, in my mother's case, that's her -- that's what she looks forward to every week. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  And I have --
L:  Just going out --
R:  And --
L:  -- to get her hair done.
R:  Same type of clients.  My husband works for the bank and I know that for the last, you know, three or four years, he's been saying, "Oh, that's it.  They're laying off, you know --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a hundred and fifty more people and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it could be any time"  And -- and luckily, he does the technology for the bank so it's --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's been a lot more secure for him because he's [NOISE] been able to keep his job because of, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the need for --
L:  Well, and --
R:  -- technical --
L:  You know, I myself, I know I've enjoyed the banking that you can do online and --
R:  Right.
L:  And, of course, we all are -- are atta- [LAUGH] attached to our ATMs.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  So, I'm -- I'm sure he'll do fine.
R:  But I guess I --
L:  But, you know, the banks themselves are hesitant to loan money because of the economy.  So, I guess --
R:  Yeah.
L:  in that way it affects everybody too.
R:  Well, and I don't know what the government --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- can do.  I can't imagine policing people in their lives to --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to know, you know -- I just think when you're investing and you're buying into things --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's an optional dec- -- it's a decision that you make on your own.  And I can't imagine that somebody, "Okay --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you can only buy so much of this and you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- can't sell this" and --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, I guess I don't understand if you --
L:  Well, you're --
R:  -- did get some in- -- some information that it wasn't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- gonna go well --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to sell out.  I mean --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- who -- I guess I don't see the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- how it would be.  I -- I assume it just would plunge the stock market.
L:  I can't imagine.
R:  But it would ha- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I would -- I think it would happen --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the next day when that information came out anyway.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I guess --
