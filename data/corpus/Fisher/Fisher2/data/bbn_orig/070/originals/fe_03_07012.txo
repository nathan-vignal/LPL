R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  My name's Lorrie.
L:  Ah, my name is Jim.
R:  Okay.
L:  I'm an architect ah and ah I just filled that form on the Internet.
R:  Oh, you did? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  This is about my third call, so it's kind of fun.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Um, they say we're supposed to talk about computers and education --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um I think that it's a good thing, I know when I was in school they really didn't use computers um until I got into high school and with my daughters, they start 'em on it in kindergarten and it's just amazing what these kids can do with the computer, they um -- I mean my kids know more about computers than I do [LAUGH] and they're nine --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and six.  So --
L:  Oh, I totally agree with that because [MN] I spent probably most of my day at work and even when I come back ah -- um just on the computer and ah even we now have studied in ah computer when we were in school but now we have to study the computer ah so I think if ah kids are doing that fr- -- at this age ah then ah definitely they can do that -- they --
R:  [NOISE] Mm.
L:  -- it will be very helpful for them in the -- in the later date.
R:  I think so, too.  I think um I think they're going to need that advantage because, you know, they're going to -- going to use computers more and more as time goes on and um [LIPSMACK] I mean I use it daily just I -- I work at home, but I use it daily and I can't imagine how much people must use it in the workplace [LAUGH].
L:  Exactly.  And ah -- and earlier the better, the earlier the kids will ah go into computers and the more it is and ah I think even I was looking at some study and ah -- ah -- ah some people think that the video games are really bad for the -- for the kids and ah all of that, yes --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that is a -- a -- a -- it's kind of a knife, the way you use it.
R:  Right.
L:  You can use it for the wrong thing and ah you know kill somebody --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and use it for the right thing and ah that can be very useful, too.
R:  Well, I think that's a good point and I also ah the thing that I notice about those games is they seem to help.  My older daughter was a preemie and I've noticed with her that um she's always about six months behind other kids on like manual dexterity and physical things.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  She gets there eventually but she's just a little bit behind --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the kids that are her -- her age and I've noticed since she started doing like you know little Nintendo games and stuff --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that she seems to have improved on that and I really think that um you know that has helped her a- -- hand eye coordination, even though it sounds kind of silly --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- [LAUGH] um but the thing that I find with them is too you do have to limit their time --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- on the computer and on the video games because they will happily sit in front of that computer screen, or that video game, all day long --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and never, ever go outside and get any physical activity, so --
L:  The -- that's --
R:  I think there needs to be --
L:  -- correct.
R:  -- a balance.
L:  Yes.  That's -- that's very important to have a balance but [MN] ah the -- you just talked about the mental mind and eye coordination --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and ah that's what they have studied in those cases, the p- -- the kids who used to play ah video games, their -- their response towards everything is really quick.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yes.  The -- that's what they have --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- studied and they said that ah their response um, even in driving, even in you know answering the questions, even remembering the data I- -- [MN] you know most of the video games when even when I was a kid I used to play video games and ah all day video games just make you remember at what part of the video game what kind of ah you know, things are going to come up --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or try to remember the maps or all --
R:  Right.
L:  -- tho- -- so, that's kind of ah -- and I -- I believe in that your mind is like your muscle, like if you start using your muscle um you -- you w- -- your muscle will develop --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- in the same manner, if you start using your brain, your brain will develop.
R:  Well, that makes sense because I know that they have um also done studies that show that if you use like crossword puzzles you're less likely to get alzheimers and things like that --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- because you're keeping your brain active.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, it makes sense that this would -- would help in that area, too.  Because like you said, you have to memorize patterns and how to win things and all that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and there's a lot to remember in some of those games.
L:  Exactly.  And these video games, you have -- and ah -- s- -- s- -- especially when I used to play, it's ah -- ah, you know, you have -- your responses should be really quick and ah you were actually playing against a machine and machine has its own set patterns and you have to remember those patterns if you need to win that game.
R:  Right.
L:  And ah th- -- there are --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- certain video games which changes the pattern over and over in doing one game and you can't actually memorize all these things --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and um ah basically you -- you are -- ah your mind is um then become such a quick, quick, um, you know, become -- make such quick responses --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to do everything.  So, I think that ah -- and in -- and in the [inaudible] if you look at all these math quiz on the -- on the computer and if you look at the, you know, on the [inaudible] um I -- I have been using this dictionary which English is my second language even -- even though and ah you just type in the word and click on the word and ah it will give you this how the word should -- will p- -- pronounce and what will be the sound of the word and ah --
R:  Oh wow, that's -- that really comes in handy.  Well, I know -- they have a lot of really good computer programs out there um that are educational.  I know one of the ones that I bought my daughters is Jumpstart --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they have like, you know, beginning reader, helping 'em do games that teach them phonics and things like that and -- and I really think that it has helped them because both of my daughters are in gifted and talented programs at school with their reading and yes I've worked with them some, but I know that the computer has helped as well because they're spending the time and they think they're playing [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so they're more willing to spend a lot of time on it, but they're actually being educated, so it's almost like having a little teacher in their bedroom [LAUGH] --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you know.
L:  That's -- that's very right because ah you know like ah -- ah when you are a kid or even -- even you are an adult ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know b- -- basically your senses, the more of your senses are involved in ah -- in -- in studying or in -- then you learn m- -- more things.
R:  Right.
L:  Ah you know, it's like they say about smoking because a lot of people smoke because it involves a lot of your -- all of your senses, sense of touch, sense of smell, sense of vision, ah, you know, the sense of taste, that's why a lot of people smoke because it involves all of your senses --
R:  Does it dull your senses, though?
L:  Excuse me?
R:  Does smoking dull your senses?
L:  W- -- ah -- that -- that's another issue, but I was go- -- I'm bringing it from another point of view that because a lot of your senses are involved in smoking that's why --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a lot of people indulge in that --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- so, if you look at the -- in -- in computer, computer is so engaging that ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it in -- in -- it engages your mind activities --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so you can spend a lot of time without knowing and you can learn a lot of stuff v- -- ah-- b- -- you know, and it w- -- won't be boring.
R:  Right.  That makes sense.
L:  Because your mind is really involved.
R:  Right.  I um -- another aspect of it that um is a little bit different twist on it, my undergraduate degree is in education and I think that computers also um make a teacher's job more efficient because instead of having to go through and add up all the scores for the semester, she can punch them into a computer program and that lets her have more time to --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or him --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- have more time to um you know focus on the actual lessons and how to help individual students than to have to spend all that time adding up grades and doing kind of the um manual labor of teaching.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I think that um computers have really helped kind of you know the flipside in education, helped the teachers and administration to be more effective.
L:  And that's right.  I -- I can ah because my wife is a teacher and she uses all these programs to -- ah to make up all these report cards and everything, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I e- -- I know that it saves a lot of time to them --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and then they --
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  -- can use -- use that time in -- in lesson plan and all of that.  So ... [MN] --
R:  So, now, does she u- --
L:  -- that's definitely a good point.
R:  Does use computers in her classroom?
L:  [MN] Mhm.
R:  She does?
L:  Yeah.  Um and the most of the you know like ah they ha- -- ah -- oh I'm a because I'm an architect and ah when I'm working on a lot of schools, designing schools --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And um now you know like in every school you have to have --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- data outlets and computer outlets and all of that because [COUGH] excuse me, without that, you know, that students can't do anything and ah --
R:  Right.
L:  -- all these autocad programs which they are ah v- -- there is now a special t- -- um, special class in the high schools that you can take autocad and which will be really helpful in +engineering later on --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and um n- -- mainly all these computer programs which um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um which you can start studying in high school which later on if you want to become an architect or an engineer or -- or --
R:  You already have that knowledge.
L:  You already have that basis.
R:  Oh, wow.  I hadn't even thought of that aspect of it.  I -- I do worry sometimes about um -- I know some of the inner city schools have less of a budget.  I kind of live out in suburbia, you know [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I know some of the inner city schools have less of a budget than the um -- than some of the other schools and I do worry sometimes that we're kind of creating this um you know some of us have all this knowledge and -- and learning and the computers where every child in the classroom has a computer and here are these other kids who are falling behind and -- and that is -- I do get concerned about that, even though, you know, they're not my children, I -- I worry about 'em sometimes and I wonder if
