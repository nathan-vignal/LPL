R:  Yeah.
L:  -- okay, very good.  So, do you like this topic?
R:  I love this topic --

L:  Oh, please, ok- --
R:  -- big family or a small one?
L:  -- okay, well I got about, well, reasonable size, four including children, two children.
R:  And your wife and you, right?
L:  And two parents.  Yes, exactly.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  How about you?
R:  I have five children and my husband and then my sisters and my mom, my brother.
L:  Oh, oh, that's big one, that's big one -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- okay, okay.
R:  Big family.
L:  All right.
R:  And they live all over, in --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- Florida and New Jersey and Pennsylvania and here.
L:  Oh, wow.  So, you are going to have lots of things to talk about but --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- ah, we have only ten minutes, right?
R:  Yeah, only ten minutes.
L:  Okay.  So, we probably need to rush.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, we could talk about whatever as long as it's to do with the family.
L:  All right, okay.
R:  Do you guys celebrate, ah, thanksgiving?  Do you all sit down for a big dinner and stuff?
L:  Um, well occasion- -- not every year.
R:  Not every year.
L:  Not every, but we do celebrate, ah, Christmas.
R:  Oh, Christmas, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you have a big dinner and presents and everything?
L:  Well, yeah, sometimes, either that or we just take a vacation somewhere else.
R:  Oh, that sounds like fun.  Where --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- does your family go to vacation, different places or always the same place?
L:  Ah, well, for instance, last year we went to San Diego --
R:  Ooh.
L:  -- and that was a lot of fun because here, we got a lot of rain here, eh, in Seattle area.
R:  See, when we go on vacation we can't go very often, maybe only once a year if we're lucky.
L:  Oh, because you have --
R:  Um.
L:  -- to bring -- you have to bring the whole big family.
R:  We bring the whole family to who- whoever's house.  Like if we --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- go to Pennsylvania, we visit the brother, we go to New Jersey, we visit the mother --
L:  Oh, that sounds good.
R:  -- and we go to Florida to visit the sister [LAUGH] --
L:  Okay, oh, that's like --
R:  -- that has the vacation and, it's like all the family, it's very important to us.
L:  Oh, that's excellent, that's excellent.  So, um, ah -- so, how old are your five children?
R:  Well, let's see, sixteen and --
L:  Sixteen.
R:  -- twelve, eight, six and two.
L:  Oh, sixteen, two, oh, wow, okay.
R:  So, from the little baby all the way up to the teenager.  She's going to --
L:  Oh, wow, so the -- the youngest is two.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh, that's almost the same as mine.
R:  Oh, how old is yours?
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH] So, what do you do with your youngest child?
R:  Well, she's just doing the -- the potty thing now, so that's cool [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- no more diapers, thank goodness.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?  Has she started speaking?
R:  Yeah, she speaks pretty well.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Little, tiny sentences like, "Mommy, I want my juice now" --
L:  Oh, really, oh.
R:  -- and stuff like that, she's so cute.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, so, I s- -- guess you probably have to stay home to take care of your children.
R:  No, I'm -- I work and my husband works, but we have different shifts.
L:  Oh, wow, but you got f- five children, how are you able to manage to have enough shifts to take care of both?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  It's -- it's --
L:  So you must --
R:  -- a struggle, but it's, you know --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- like, we're juggling jobs, and we're juggling the taking care of the kids, but it's worth it.
L:  Oh, wow --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- okay, okay, okay.  Oh, so what do you d- -- wha- -- ah, ah, what do you do in your work?
R:  Oh, inventory.  I do inventory.
L:  Oh, okay, okay.
R:  And he's a bouncer, so, [inaudible].
L:  Okay.  So, ah, okay -- so, ah, how do you juggle with your busy schedule --
R:  [LAUGH] It --
L:  -- so that all five children at home can be taken care of at the same time?
R:  Well, sometimes the older ones helps watch the little one sometimes while I'm doing the dishes or the laundry or whatever.  The little guys are acting up, the big ones will help take care of them.
L:  Oh, all right.  Okay, interesting, okay.
R:  Are your guys close together in age, your little ones?
L:  Ah, one is fi- -- ah, four and a half, the other is two and a half, about two years apart.
R:  Oh, so they're not at the, um --
L:  Yeah, th- --
R:  -- stage at where they can help each other.  They're still babies.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're still cute.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I mean, they're fighting with each other every now and then.
R:  So, your wife stays home and takes care of the babies?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, that's good.  I wish --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I could do that always.
L:  Oh, really, wh- why don't you do that?
R:  Well, I don't know, I haven't found a way to work at home yet, 'cause if I don't --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- work at home, then --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, the money doesn't stretch far with my husband's job only.
L:  Oh, I see, okay.
R:  'Cause there's too many kids [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, okay --
R:  -- buy all the shoes and all the books and all the whatever.
L:  -- but on the other hand, I mean, if you, oh, you -- you hire your baby sitter, all right --
R:  Ah, it'll be too --
L:  -- that'll be even more all right.
R:  -- yeah, it would be too expensive [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- 'cause --
L:  -- but you don't --
R:  -- then I'll be working to pay the baby sitter mostly, you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.  So, you don't have a baby sitter at all, for five children?
R:  No.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, how -- ah, that's almost impossible, ah, so --
R:  Well, my best friend, her name is Mary, she watches them sometimes, on a blue moon [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- if I have something very important like, ah, I don't know, like Valentines Day, "Oh, I got to go out, I just have to go out."  "Oh, really?" --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- "Can you watch them for, like, five hours?"  She'll be like, "Okay --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  "-- they can sleep over".  [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.  So, you -- you probably need to have a huge van to take care of, ah, to, you know, to ship all of your -- your kids from one place to the other.
R:  No, we go on the bus everywhere.  [LAUGH]
L:  You go to -- on the bus to anywhere?  Oh, wow, that's the way.
R:  Yeah, we can't afford the big van.  We want one but we can't afford it.
L:  Oh, oh.  Oh, wow.  With -- wow, that's -- that's -- that's a not very convenient thing to do, when you [inaudible] -- but your older one can probably take care of the younger one, so --
R:  Yeah, she's good with them.
L:  And I guess, I thinking, in our State there is a law which says that, um, other children have to be over twelve or thirteen years old in order for --
R:  Yeah, to keep an eye on the little ones.
L:  -- an adult not to be home.
R:  Yeah, that's what they told me, I think they said she has to be, like, fourteen or something, but she's sixteen, so it's good.
L:  Oh, so she, yes, so, does she help a lot at home?
R:  She helps a lot, she [LAUGH] she -- she gets a big allowance 'cause she helps a lot.
L:  Oh, that's interesting.  Okay, now I guess just a few years ago before, ah, she reaches that age --
R:  That was hard.
L:  -- you would not be able -- you need to come back home all the time, right, because it's --
R:  Yeah, that was hard, like -- like --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- her and the -- and the next youngest one, they would -- they would still help me, but I would have to be here when they helped me --
L:  Uh-huh, oh, okay.
R:  -- like -- like I say, if I'm in the kitchen and, ah, and they're in the living room watching television, I could do the dishes and they could keep an eye on the little ones but if something happens they come and tell me and then mom jumps up and says, "Oh, what's the matter?" you know?
L:  Ah.
R:  But I couldn't leave the house.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, okay, that's -- okay.  Now, how about, ah, so you, so what's your shift, ah, work like?  I mean you come -- you go to work be- between what an- wha- -- what time to what time?
R:  Well, it's all mixed up, sometimes I work in the morning or the afternoon or over night --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- my shift is very strange, but his shift --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- is always over night.
L:  Oh, wow.  So, that means that you two really need to have flexible working schedule.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  And, well if, ah, one of your kids gets sick, what do you --
R:  Oh, god, then I got to -- then I got --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- stay home and I got to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- tell my job, "Listen, I got no choice" --
L:  Oh, oh, I see.
R:  -- and hope I don't get fired.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I see, okay, okay, interesting.  Yeah, in -- i- i- in my family, when the kids in my family are unwell it will be more flexible because my wife stays at home.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, she takes them too, and the one, our older one wants to go to school.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, ah -- so, ah, you know, ah, even, ah, my wife, ah, can still have some free time. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  I -- occasionally I stay at home to take care of one of, ah, one of the kids.
R:  That's good, 'cause sometimes you just need a break.
L:  Because I got -- I got -- I got three weeks of holi- -- of vacation --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for my work --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so last -- last year -- last year I took about, probably about -- about close to t- two weeks --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- you know, taking care, and then one week going for vacation.
R:  Oh, that sounds good.
L:  So. [LAUGH]
R:  I know your wife enjoyed the time when she had to get her free time.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, okay --
R:  'Cause it's very stressful.
L:  -- so -- so -- so what kind of free time do you get?
R:  I do -- when I get it I just go to the movies and stuff like that.
L:  You go -- oh, all by yourself?
R:  Yeah, sometimes.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH] All right. [LAUGH]
R:  If I'm lucky enough to have a baby sitter, me and my husband go together, but sometimes --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I gotta go by myself when he's at work.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, wow.  Okay, okay.
R:  If I --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- get a break.
L:  Okay, so you work how many hours a week on average?
R:  Ah, not that many, like, maybe twenty five.
L:  Oh, oh, that's not bad all right, that's not bad, it's not -- it's not kind of, ah, forty --
R:  Yeah, it's all I -- 
L:  -- hours, ah, as most of the other people have.
R:  Yeah, because it's a -- it's a, um [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- ah, what do you call it, it's kind of like a fly by night job, it's not like a every day job when they call me, that's when I come in --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- like, two weeks I didn't work zero [LAUGH] --
L:  Ah, oh.
R:  -- and then this week I --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- only worked two days and next week --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- I work five days --
L:  All right, okay.
R:  -- so it's all [LAUGH] weird.
L:  Yeah, but I -- but I head that Long Island is a very nice place they are.
R:  No, no, no, Statton Island, Statton Isl-
L:  So, you get a lot of sunshine a-
