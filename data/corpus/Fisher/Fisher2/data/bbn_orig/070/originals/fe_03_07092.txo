R:  Hi, my name is Dana.
L:  I'm -- I'm Damien.  [SIGH]
R:  Damien?
L:  Oh, hi, ya, Dana, how are you doing?
R:  Whoa!  Holy shit!
L:  Excellent.  I'm so glad I'm getting people I know.  I don't want to talk about this topic.  [SIGH]
R:  I know, right -- ah --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- this is so right.  [LAUGH]
L:  Awesome.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, what do you think about the corporate c- conduct?  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  I think it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think it's wonderful.  I think corporations are behaving themselves e- exactly as they should.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, yes, me too, of course.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  Hey, so what's going on up there?
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, nothing much.  Where are you?  [SIGH]
R:  I'm in Jacksonville.
L:  Oh, Jeez.  [SIGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  U- um.
R:  You knew that.  We said goodbye the o- other day.
L:  I know.  I know.  [SIGH]  Um, I had -- what about David's[?] keys to his bike?  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, fuck, I could m- mail it to you.
L:  Oh, that's okay.  [SIGH]
R:  Well, I think I'm going to mail a push broom soon.
L:  Okay, cool, s- send the keys too.
R:  When I mail that I'll send it with the push broom.
L:  Make a -- make a copy of the key and then send it -- the other one.
R:  Oh, don't worry.  I had every intention of keeping a copy all for myself.
L:  Okay, cool.  [SIGH]  So, we should maybe talk about the topic, maybe, I don't know.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- okay, I guess.
L:  Um.
R:  Um, Martha Stewart might go to jail.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Who?  [NOISE]
R:  Martha Stewart.
L:  Your sister?
R:  Martha Stewart!
L:  Martha Stewart might go to jail.  Why?  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, you didn't hear about that?
L:  N- n- no.  [SIGH]
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] for corporate fraud sort of thing.  Well, not really, like, [SIGH] um, s- she got ... insider stock trading tips.
L:  Really?
R:  And sold, like, a whole bunch of shares of the stock a day before it ... p- plummeted.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  Because, um, the FBI wasn't gonna -- like something happened --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- and so, like, [MN] she was indicted on nine charges including, --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- like, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, like, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- p- perjury maybe or something like [SIGH] -- yeah, so Martha Stewart is in a lot of trouble.
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, wow!  How do you think this will affect their readership?  [SIGH]
R:  Um, well, like --
L:  Her readership?
R:  -- her stocks plummeted today.  [SIGH]  And, like, she stepped down.
L:  She has stocks?  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, like h- her -- yeah, like, Martha --
L:  Oh, her magazine --
R:  -- Stewart Living --
L:  -- and stuff, yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  --  and her magazine and her, like, Kmart --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- line of h- home ... goods.
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  And, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [MN] and she --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- let's see, [SIGH] well, yeah, she stepped down as the head --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of the company and stuff.
L:  [NOISE]  R- really?  Wow, that's insane.  [NOISE]
R:  And, like, her lawyer [SIGH] ... is trying to say that, like, um, that she was unfairly targeted [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and that, like, perhaps it's because she's a successful woman [SIGH] who made it out of her own ingenuity and hard work --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and turning into like a -- a -- like a sexism issue.
L:  [SIGH]  Hm.
R:  When, ... I mean, I -- a- and like other people are saying that, like, [SIGH] the government is going after her to prove that they're not going to be soft on, like, c- corporate crime and shit --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- like they were, you know, like, [SIGH] --
L:  But the government's ridden with corporate crime.
R:  Exactly, because like --
L:  What about George Bush.  [LAUGH]  He's a -- he's a corporate criminal himself.
R:  Exactly, like, instead -- so it's really fucked up that like I kind of -- instead of going after, like, all his cronies and his buddies they're going after, like, Martha Stewart --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- to try and prove that they're not soft on corporate crime, you know?
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  So, ...
L:  At least not soft on ... w- women who commit c- corporate crime.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  And, like, people that -- like, women who don't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- p- probably don't give money to the -- you know, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like, she's probably not a big d- donator --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or something.
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  Who knows?  I don't know what her politics are but ...
L:  Yeah, I think she's p- probably Republican now.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Probably.  Maybe.
L:  [NOISE]  I mean, she's a housewife.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Like, not all house- -- well, yeah, but [SIGH] like, I doubt that, I don't know, if she gave a lot of money to the p- party it's not like that they would let that happen, you know?
L:  Y- yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  So, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I have a feeling that, like, that they're ... just trying to, like, ... p- prove a point or whatever.
L:  [SIGH]  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
R:  But ...
L:  Hm, [SIGH] yeah.
R:  [MN]  So, what do you think about corporate crime?
L:  [SIGH]  Well, I mean it happens every day.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, just things like, um, [MN] I mean [SIGH] like, the -- like the whole, a- ah, war -- war on Iraq was a corporate crime, like ...
R:  Yeah, it was.
L:  [SIGH]  All the -- all the oil c- companies, like, C- Chaney and [SIGH] and the Bush family own were [SIGH] benefited ... a lot from the war.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Um, see this is dumb.  We totally agree --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on everything.
L:  Yeah, I know.  [NOISE]  They should -- I don't know how this happened, how we got, a- a- ah, connected?  [SIGH]
R:  It's awesome.
L:  So, far I've talked to y- you and Ces.  [SIGH]
R:  It's [SIGH] so funny!
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  Wow!
L:  I always get nervous calling this thing because I -- I don't want to talk to a stranger, especially about this topic, like.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  But it's good that we got each other.  It's great.
R:  Um, what did you do last night?  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  U- um, oh, we went dumpstering.  [SIGH]
R:  Mm, neat.
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, we went to a bar too.  Actually, we went to O- Odessa's while some other people b- braved the rain and dumpstered.  [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  And then they ... didn't get any vegetables so I went out and dumpstered again.  [SIGH]
R:  Um ...
L:  But I had a whisky sour, that's all.  [SIGH]
R:  Nice.  Odessa's nice, huh?
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, I love it.  It's like -- I think it's my favorite bar here.  [SIGH]
R:  Um, [MN] who went?
L:  'Cause they don't card or anything, like, I could go in there, like, when I was twenty and stuff.  [SIGH]
R:  They don't card?  [SIGH]
L:  N- no.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, man.
L:  [NOISE]  Not at all.
R:  Um, ... well you haven't --
L:  Well, ... w- we got tons of, like, good shit from dumpstering, like, junk food, like, b- brownies and [SIGH] --
R:  Whoa!
L:  -- that kind of thing.  [SIGH]  Vegetarian pasta.  [SIGH]
R:  From where?
L:  Um, I think they went to Gustavo's.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Nice.
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, yeah.
R:  Um, ...
L:  [SIGH]  What've you been doing in -- Jacksonville?  [SIGH]
R:  Um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- well, I got in, like, yesterday --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I was like hanging around [SIGH] our house, being miserable.  I'm going to, like, go to my old ... w- work t- today --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and get my job back.
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  How do you think you're going to la- -- how long are you e- expecting to last down there?  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Um, [SIGH] ... I don't know, like, 'cause I w- want to be back there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- right now.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Like, I just want to be in New York.
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  But it's kind of good, like, I s- should work if I'm going to be down here --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- something maybe , like, two weeks --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- or three weeks.
L:  Yeah, I found some pants in -- on the street yesterday.  They w- were drying, so [NOISE] -- so hopefully, they'll f- fit me.  [NOISE]  I'll have to see when they dry.  [SIGH]
R:  Mm.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [MN]  Are they nice.
L:  Then I think I'll get a job.  [SIGH]
R:  Are they work pants?
L:  Oh, they're Dockers.  [NOISE]  They've got, like, holes in them and shit.  [NOISE]
R:  Where are you going to get a job?
L:  [NOISE]  Hopefully, like a pizza delivery place and stuff.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.  You're going to have to get a big basket on the front of your bike.
L:  What?
R:  You're going to have to get a big flat basket --
L:  Oh, the bikes a- are --
R:  -- on the front of your bike.
L:  -- company bikes
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  That's awesome!
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  Company t- transportation.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  Don't be corrupt.
L:  What?  [SIGH]
R:  Don't be corrupt for the company.
L:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH]  I won't.
R:  Don't go giving your friends --
L:  They're not corporations though.
R:  -- special favors.
L:  Maybe they're little incorporations, I don't know.  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
L:  But just for those ones down on [SIGH] [NOISE] -- on a [SIGH] [NOISE] -- I don't know, like, ah, in the East Village.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  It's pretty hard to be a -- a c- corporation [NOISE] when you're that small [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if you just deliver pizza.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]  And I guess you can rip off your workers but, [SIGH] I mean, it's not --
R:  Well, I mean -- you know, --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Yeah.
R:  Um, you could give your friends special favors and, like, that's ... like, obviously, that's not part of a corporation thing, but i- it's like emulating them.
L:  I- it's a form of corruption, I guess.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  But it doesn't really matter i- it's on such a low scale.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, it's different [NOISE] when it's -- when like these people are c- controlling the country.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.  In fact I f- fully expect you to give your friends special favors.
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]  I think it'd be corrupt of you not too.  [NOISE]  Oh, God!  [NOISE]
L:  What's wrong with your dog?  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
L:  Mm, is there a beach in Jacksonville?
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]  There's lots of beach.  [NOISE]  That's kind of like [SIGH] what it's [NOISE] known for.  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, cool.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  Mm.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hm.
L:  Do you like the beach there?  [NOISE]
R:  Not really.  [NOISE]  I don't know I was never a beach person.  [NOISE]
L:  Oh!
R:  [NOISE]  Like in May it's all right, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, but, like, during the day it's just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- really hot.  [NOISE]  It's really crowded.  There's lots of sand.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [NOISE]  Like, it's up your arse.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  And, like, I don't know.
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  And, yeah, [SIGH] --
R:  I think --
L:  -- do -- are b- -- are beaches privately owned there in ...?
R:  No.
L:  No.  That's good.
R:  [NOISE]  That's impossible.
L:  In Oregon there's -- it's illegal to have private beaches --
R:  I think it's --
L:  -- all the --
R:  -- illegal here too.
L:  --Yeah, [NOISE] that's good.  [NOISE]  Not in Connecticut.  All the Connecticut -- all the beaches are [SIGH] -- are --
R:  How's that possible?
L:  -- are privately owned, [SIGH] just about.  [NOISE]
R:  Um, so like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- how do you get on them?
L:  [NOISE]  U- u- um, --
R:  Do you have to pay?
L:  -- you can't really get on the beaches [LAUGH] in Connecticut unless you live there [SIGH] --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- or go to a hotel there.  [SIGH]  I mean sometimes you can go down on the beach [NOISE] even if they're p- privately owned, like, there's access --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- but [SIGH] Connecticut's a horrible state.
R:  Is it?
L:  I bet there's a lot of c- corporate crimes there.  [SIGH]  [LAUGH]
R:  I think Martha Stewart, like, has a house in Connecticut.
L:  Does she?  [NOISE]
R:  I think she does.
L:  Hm.  [NOISE]  I mean it's surprising.  Where -- where's Martha's Vineyard?  [SIGH]
R:  U- um ...
L:  I think that's Maine, isn't it?
R:  N- no.  I'm sure it's, like, Maryland or Virginia or somewhere.
L:  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah, maybe [NOISE] so.
R:  I think.
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  And it has nothing to do with her.
L:  No.  [LAUGH]  Nothing to do with Martha Stewart.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, not at all.
L:  I don't think so, does it?
R:  No, it's, ah, Martha Washington, I think.
L:  Oh, yeah, Martha Washington.  Okay.
R:  I think that, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- old school Martha.  [NOISE]
L:  Old rule, yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  How's the weather?
L:  A- ah, --
R:  Has it warmed up?
L:  -- actually it's -- [NOISE] like, y- yesterday it was pissing down rain but now it's [SIGH] -- it -- t- t- the sun's out and stuff.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [MN]  And I contemplated going outside but [NOISE] [SIGH] I think I'll just stay here until [SIGH] -- [NOISE] until, like, maybe six and then go outside.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [NOISE]  I'll meet Gronyea[?] down ... t- town and then [NOISE] go dumpstering.
R:  Uh-hum.  What's she doing?  What's everyone doing?
L:  Oh, Bumpy and Gronyea a- are computer programming.  [SIGH]
R:  So, Bumpy left the house?
L:  Right, now, they -- they're in -- in the house.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh!
L:  They're in ... Gronyea's room.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I think Gronyea's meeting this ... old feminist woman who's -- who might give her -- giver us her apartment in [SIGH] Greenwich Village.  [SIGH]
R:  Why?
L:  Because she h- hates the city and she wants to leave and [SIGH] we met her, like, walking in the woods up in Gronyea's town.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  And we just started talking to her for a long time.  She's really excited about the info shop opening here and she's gone and donated all the books.
R:  She's a lot of books ... that she wants to donate?
L:  T- this old feminist.  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  Wow!  And so ... she'll give you the apartment.
L:  Um, maybe.  Well, it's three hundred dollars a month.  [SIGH]
R:  Whoa, rent control, huh?
L:  Y- y- yeah.  [SIGH]  And we can buy it for [NOISE] sixty thousand.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  Which, if we -- if we got it and then rented it out for two thousand dollars a month to somebody [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we could -- we could own it in, like, three [NOISE] years.  [SIGH]
R:  Right, but how can you do that?
L:  What do you mean?  [SIGH]
R:  Like, how -- isn't that, like, i- illegal -- it's, like, rented out for more than ... you're paying for it?
L:  [SIGH]  Maybe.  [SIGH]  I don't know.  [NOISE]
R:  Mm.
L:  I don't know about that.  Corporate crime.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
