R:  Hi.  My name is Cheryl Anne Tall[?].
L:  Hi.  I'm Missy.
R:  Hey.
L:  We're supposed to talk about fam- -- what family means to us?
R:  Yeah.
L:  How many children do you have?
R:  Well, I really don't have any kids.
L:  No?
R:  No.  I'm only a college student at the moment --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- prior[?] moment.
L:  Oh, great.
R:  But yes, I do have a big family.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Um, do you have kids?
L:  Yes, I do.
R:  Oh, you do?
L:  I have --
R:  How many?
L:  I have -- I have a twelve year old son and a twelve year old step daughter.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, that's great. [LAUGH]
L:  Two twelve year olds. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I have a four year old brother.  He practically -- well, I practically took care of him from -- ever since he was so young.  So, it's like [LAUGH] that -- it's like my son, I could say. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I basically know everything.
L:  How big of a family do you come from?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, it's real big but it's, like, broken apart 'cause like every -- all my family's in different states right --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- right about now.
L:  That's gotta be hard.
R:  And you?
L:  Ah, actually, I'm adopted --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  A- and, um, my parents have two other children of their own.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow.  Is the family really big or ...?
L:  No, just -- um, not very big at all. [LAUGH] 
R:  No?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, that's what my family is right about now.
L:  Yeah.  And I don't --
R:  Just the same faces all the time. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not very big.
R:  Mm.  So, what do you think family really means?
L:  Um, having someone to rely on.
R:  Yeah.  Basically, right?
L:  Yeah.  Having someone to rely on.
R:  Like they say, blood is always thicker than water. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause the family's always there for you.
L:  It seems that way. [LAUGH]
R:  In times of need.  Mhm.  Most [LAUGH] of the time, right? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's true.  Um, I have one sister -- one older sister and two younger brothers.
L:  Mm.
R:  Yep.  And even though -- you know how some times you'll be like, "Oh, my god -- I can't stand you --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- I hate you" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it's not true because they're -- in all actuality, you really love them. [LAUGH]
L:  You still have to see 'em at dinner. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  [LAUGH] You have to get over it.  You have to get over it.
R:  That's how it is. [LAUGH]
L:  Do you pl- --
R:  But family does mean a lot.
L:  Yes.  Do you plan on having a family?
R:  Of course. [LAUGH]
L:  Do you?
R:  I want at least, well, let me see ...?  Four kids.
L:  Four?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.
R:  I love kids. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, that's good.  That's good.
R:  I love kids.  They know best.
L:  Nothing wrong with that.  That's good.
R:  Probably, like, what ...?  Two to three more years.  Af- -- I'd say, after I finish graduating from school and getting settled in and everything.
L:  Now, do you feel that, um, it will be harder on you, um, raising a family or keeping the family together if you were working outside of the home or anything like that?
R:  It probably might be --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the keeping the family together because I really see myself as like -- I would be doing, like, so much [LAUGH] in time to come.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But raising 'em, I don't think it would be a problem.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But with keeping them together 'cause you know how it is when a parent is absent --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- from a family.
L:  Yeah.
R:  How, you know, kids could go astray.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Then this one feel another way compared to the other one.  So -- so, I say, well the -- what about you?
L:  Well, I, um, worked outside of the home when my son was real small.
R:  Okay.
L:  And, um, worked a lot of hours so -- but then, for the last four years, I've been home full time and it really does make a big difference when it comes to the family being able to be home, you know, when th- -- when they are.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I've recently gone back to school so --
R:  Oh, really?  That's good.
L:  Yeah.  I'm, um, going -- taking pre-licensing courses for my real estate license.
R:  Oh, that's -- yeah.
L:  So, I'm able to be gone when he's at school and home when he's home.
R:  Oh, that's great.
L:  And that's -- that helps.
R:  That's really good.  'Cause most of the time is just, like, the neglect is --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- not good. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  But if you -- like, I started out in school but, um -- like, elementary education and stuff.
L:  Mm.
R:  And then I had, like, a course of the, um, child psychology and you start 'em out from ch- -- um, ad- -- um, from being born to adolescent and the time of need and all of that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, like, neglect is [LAUGH] big on the part of being an adolescent --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when the parent's not around.
L:  Being able to be there and sit down and have dinner and ... [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  Inform the kids what's been going on and everything like that.
L:  That's --
R:  I really just can't wait 'til the day. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They're probably, like, "I'm ready now".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But I know if I do then it will slow stuff down.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I just wanna get it over with and after --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'll be able to relax and enjoy it.
L:  Yup.
R:  'Cause --
L:  It's -- it's rewarding.
R:  It is. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  It's -- it's --
R:  'Cause I didn't -- yeah.
L:  It's trying. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm. [LAUGH] What i- -- [LAUGH]
L:  Keeping -- keeping a family together is --
R:  It's tough.
L:  -- the communication there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, I can say that although my son is from a split home --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- my son and my daughter both are from split homes, but both of them, I feel, are very well adjusted.
R:  That's good.
L:  Because -- because my husband and I married and it just instills in the kids that there's something there.
R:  Yeah.  Some, kind of, stability.  It's just --
L:  I mean, we sit down and, you know, there's never a night that we don't sit down to dinner together.
R:  Oh, that's great.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, even if he works late, you know, when he gets home, we still sit down while he's finishing dinner. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's nice. [LAUGH]
L:  You know?  So, it's there and they -- and they can see that, you know, though they both have been through the divorces --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that there is still something solid.
R:  Oh, that's great. [LAUGH]
L:  You know?  There is still something there.  People that they can rely on.
R:  That's really good.  'Cause kids [LAUGH] -- it's crazy with just -- what they go through --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there 'cause it makes them --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- turn into such a different person.
L:  Yes.
R:  It's funny. [LAUGH]
L:  But as long as they can feel, I think -- feel that there are people there that they can depend on.
R:  Yeah.  Their family of course. [LAUGH] So, in their hearts it could really be, like, "Well, I got my family --"
L:  Mm.
R:  "-- I'm gonna stick by my family".
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's really good.
L:  Are your -- are your parents still around?
R:  Yeah, but my mother and father divorced when I was, like, what ...?  Four?  I didn't even remember anything.  So --
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I still communicate with my -- well, I live with my mother.  And my father, I see him all the time, whenever I go home.
L:  So, there's still a -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- still a close bond there?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I guess the reason why it never really affected me 'cause I wasn't at age to know anything that was going on so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  It really isn't a problem 'cause I still get the same love from both parents.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  Yeah.  And unless it's made an issue --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't think with most children it's -- I mean, I'm sure that it -- it's trying and hard on them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But as long as both parents are willing to work together --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they can feel that they're --
R:  Yup.
L:  -- that it helps out a lot with the children.
R:  'Cause right now our family is pretty good. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I see them summertime 'cause that's when, you know, everybody gets together.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Barbeques --
L:  Yup.
R:  -- going out to part --
L:  And all the family get toge- -- [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I know family looks for any reason to have a picnic. [LAUGH]
R:  R- -- p- -- [LAUGH] really?
L:  They do.  It's terrible.
R:  I thought that's just only my family.
L:  It's terrible but if somebody passes away, they've all gotta -- you know, let's go over here and have a cookout.
R:  Right.  Like, my grandmother, it rained on Memorial Day, she still had her barbeque.
L:  Yup.
R:  She insisted on people still come into the house. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yes.
R:  I was, like, "She gotta be kidding me".
L:  And what part of the country are you from?
R:  Oh, I'm from -- I'm Trinidad and Tobago.
L:  Mm.
R:  Y- -- um, the West Indies.
L:  Hm.
R:  And I currently live in New York City.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And you?
L:  I'm in Ohio.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Springfield, Ohio.
R:  How is it out there?  I was planning to go to one of the college out there.
L:  Born and raised here.
R:  Really?
L:  And my -- my whole family. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Everybody's still here. [LAUGH] 
R:  Is it nice?
L:  Very few of them are gone. [LAUGH]
R:  'Cause I need a change from -- New York City is so boring. [LAUGH] 
L:  Is it?  I wouldn't --
R:  Probably, you would have fun because you're in -- you, like -- you're not used to it but I think I would have fun out there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But since, you would have fun here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause like, I'm tired of the same old stuff. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I need to get away to somewhere where nobody's going.  Everybody's going to Georgia --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Virginia --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- Baltimore, Maryland[?], ah --
L:  Slower lifestyles maybe.
R:  Mhm.  It's everybody just trying to get away for a change.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause I go to school upstate so I need to get away.  Is it nice, like, in Ohio?
L:  Yeah.  You figure[?] we've got -- you know, it's pretty.
R:  It's pretty?
L:  It's pretty.  Yes.  There's a lotta open country.
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  Lots of green and it's pretty.
R:  I like the green. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm tired of the -- the noise, the buses, the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- oh, my god.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Unless you live real far way, like, in Long Island or something, where there's a little bit of green but, mm -- they call it artificial. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I really need to get away from New York City.  It's getting really annoying.
L:  I've only been to New York one time.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  My fam- -- yeah.  My family and I went when ... oh, I must've been ... must've been in eighty two.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Did you have fun or ...?
L:  Yeah.  We just went for a weekend.  It was, like, a spur of the moment thing.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  My father picked us up from school and --
R:  Oh, really?  That's nice.
L:  M- -- yeah.  Picked up me and my girlfriend from school and he says -- I think --
R:  Did you guys drive there?
L:  Yeah.  It's --
R:  And how long was it?
L:  Um, I really can't remember.  We left -- I think we left in the morning and we were there -- I mean, it was only a few hours.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  It wasn't -- it wasn't too f- -- too long.  But we, um, went to New York and we went up to see, um, Niagara Falls.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's nice.
L:  We just took a weekend.
R:  Oh, that was nice.
L:  As I said, he picked us up from school on Friday and said --
