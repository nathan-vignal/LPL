L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, my name is [inaudible].
R:  Mine's Anita.
L:  Hi,  Anita.
R:  So --
L:  It's an interesting topic, I think.
R:  Yes, family.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  I've got a family.  I'm married.
L:  But -- okay, I -- well, I have a um like a blood family that -- and a um, I'm not married, I'm twenty two years old right now and live with some friends, but I've sort of ah feel like my friends have become almost like closer family, or at least another kind of family, so I think about that a lot.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um.  Because I keep in touch with my -- my -- my family but I also have kind of started a [SIGH] creating a new family relations just through my friendships and [inaudible] community and the neighborhood in the town where I live.  So ...
R:  W- -- where do you live?
L:  [LIPSMACK] I live in Lakeworth, ah, it's a small town south west Palm Beach, in south Florida.
R:  Oh.
L:  Where do you live?
R:  I live in Oklahoma.
L:  Oklahoma.  What part -- what city?
R:  Ardmore.
L:  And how long have you been there for?
R:  Ah, lord.  I've been here for years.
L:  Your whole family's over there?
R:  Well, ah yeah, ah my mother lives in Oklahoma, she lives in a little small area called Coleman[?] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and ah she got sick, so I came up here to take care of her and I've kind of been here ever since.
L:  Oh. 
R:  I -- o- -- I kind of grew up around this area.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I went to school here for a little while and, you know, I've lived in Texas and stuff and I just kind of call this home though, now.
L:  Yeah.  How big is your family?
R:  Ah, I have four children of my own.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I have six grandchildren, ah let's see ... [LIPSMACK] I have a ninety six year old grandmother who's still alive.
L:  Wow.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Is she also Oklahoma.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's here too.  Ah, [PAUSE] let's see.  My in laws live in Oklahoma here.  You know, though I mean, e- -- everybody lives within a -- oh, about an hour's drive from each other.
L:  You all keep in touch?
R:  Oh yeah.  Yeah, we -- we call or we get on the Internet and -- and talk with each other and stuff, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- and then I have ah one daughter in Arkansas and I have a daughter in Kansas --
L:  Some other thing a lot -- a lot of families is how they evolved um like outside families, like um [LIPSMACK] like if grandparents participate and help in, you know, um, [LIPSMACK] raise the kids and -- a lot of people have kids when they're pretty young and I [inaudible] experienced parents, so it seems to make sense that the older generations of family that would -- would participate, or get them out, you know, and ah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- help out that.  Has that been true in your family at all?
R:  Ah, well it was when I was young, yeah.  Ah, my kids live too far away --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, for me to really participate in -- in doing anything with -- with the grandkids right now.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I know my grandmother and grandfather helped my mom with me and my brother, you know, when we were younger and [SIGH] ah stuff like that, but as -- as far as me getting to um help with my grandkids, I haven't yet.
L:  Yeah, it seems like something that's becoming less common, you know, just with ah, I don't know, the --
R:  I just don't think I have the patience anymore.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I really don't, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I mean, my daughter will call me on the phone and I'll hear them babies squealing and screaming in the background, you know and --
L:  And your motherly instinct doesn't kick in [LAUGH]?
R:  -- no, it's like, "I got to go, I'll talk to you later" [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, "Call me when the kids ain't screaming" [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  No, I guess if I was -- if I was surrounded, you know in -- in -- in this type of stuff it would probably be okay, but right now, you know, like even the -- to go sit in a restaurant and eat someplace, you know, and I hear this kid squealing, it's just like, "Oh, my god.  Get me out of here".
L:  Yeah.  Oh, no.
R:  You know, I did not want to hear this crap [LAUGH].
L:  Wow.
R:  I did my time [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]  Whoa.
R:  So, I've been a momma since I was seventeen years old --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- so, I did my time [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  My mom started raising her first kid, I think -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- she got married when she was sixteen and she had some kids when she was eighteen, but in a lot of ways it was really just to get out of her -- her parents' house, you know, she wanted kind of her independent life because her parents were pretty --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ah -- pretty strict immigrants.
R:  Yeah.  That's -- that's a bad --
L:  Parents.
R:  -- way to want to you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to -- to start it, but you know lots of us have done that [LAUGH].
L:  Yep.  Yep.
R:  Yeah.  And I just don't think I could -- could deal with them babies squealing all the time anymore. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yep.  Well, --
R:  [SIGH] But I guess teachers love 'em, you know.  I get emails and stuff and --
L:  That's good.
R:  -- and my daughter calls me, you know, and --
L:  That's good.
R:  -- ah -- which is kind of strange because I didn't figure she really ever would because ah I lost her and her sister ah for -- well, her I'd lost for thirteen years and her sister was fourteen years.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And ah, you know, um her sister was like, ah, oh god, like maybe in ah +kindergarten --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and she was like eight, seven or eight --
L:  Oh.  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and so when I did finally find 'em again and everything, I've got these grown women, you know, and [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they're just now getting around to ah my oldest one'll -- will -- every now and then she'll call me "mom" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, so it's -- it's been a long hard road trying to [LAUGH] --
L:  [NOISE] [inaudible]
R:  -- get my -- get my family back --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- together, but --
L:  Oh.  It's hard.
R:  You know.  Now that it's -- it's semi coming that way, so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and now I'm too old to enjoy it [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, no.
R:  [LAUGH] It's like, "Okay, fine.  I don't care.  [LAUGH] Leave me alone, I'm playing a game." [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  What kind of games do you play?
R:  Oh, I -- I like this ah -- ah, it's called "Bejeweled", it's ah -- another name for it's Diamond Mine.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah we -- I found it on the Internet and it's -- it's rather addictive [LAUGH].
L:  Oh.
R:  But I -- I'm into playing with my pictures, you know, I -- I um redo old photos and stuff --
L:  Oh, nice.
R:  -- and ah I got into that here, oh I guess within the last year, you know because my baby is -- is seventeen, so you know she's -- she's almost out of here and --
L:  Uh-huh.  Sure.
R:  -- so I got to find something to fill my day [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  I figure, why not play at the computer, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, [several inaudible words] get into that stuff.  A friend of mine's been getting into like ah [LIPSMACK] the different, like clubs like ah friend kind of social clubs on the Internet.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I think it's weird because I know how to use a computer a little bit for research and for things here and there, emails and stuff, but I can never get -- really get into like the computer social life.  It just seemed like, I don't know, kind of a strange thing to me.
R:  Well, my husband has a room over on MSN --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that ah it's called Big Zan's Naughty Truth or Dare Games --
L:  Uh-oh.
R:  -- and if you're twenty one or over you can go in there and play games and -- and meet people, you know, I mean they -- they do truth and dares over the Internet, you know --
L:  Gosh.
R:  -- it's just -- just a game.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  And if people start taking it serious then they're -- they're asked to -- to go away because it's -- it's not a serious thing.  It's -- it's a game.
L:  Yep.
R:  You know, you go in there and ah have some fun and -- and forget a rotten day you may have had or something, you know, for that day.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But we have had some people that is -- have taken it extremely serious but you know I kind of consider them my -- my other ah -- an extended part to my family.
L:  Yeah, well.
R:  Because there's some of them on here we've known now for like three years, almost four years --
L:  Have you met 'em before um in person or on computer?
R:  -- there's a few of them, yes, that we have met in person.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, the -- the majority of them we haven't, but um, you know, st- -- still they're like my family, you know, if --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if they're sick or hurting, then you know I hurt too because I know they're in -- in misery, you know and --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and I don't -- I -- I don't like seeing anybody suffer.
L:  Yeah.  Me either.
R:  You know, or be sick or -- or not feel good, or whatever, you know.  But ah -- they're -- they're, you know, they're -- they're a bunch of good people out there.  You just gotta be careful on -- on some of them, you know.  We- -- we've met some that we thought were really going to be good friends and they turned out to really be the type of people we wouldn't want to associate with, so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, because ah they just couldn't
