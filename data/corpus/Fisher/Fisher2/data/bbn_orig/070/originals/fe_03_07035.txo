R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  [inaudible] hello.  Where are you calling from?
R:  Ah, Seattle, Washington.
L:  Oh, it's raining out there, I guess?
R:  No, actually it's really nice today.
L:  Oh, well, it --
R:  It's really sunny.
L:  -- it rains how much out of a period of a day --
R:  Um --
L:  -- or a week?
R:  A week?  It rains about four days a week here.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Pretty often.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Where are you calling from?
L:  Ah, round Philadelphia area.
R:  Oh, okay.  Awesome.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Coast to coast [LAUGH], I guess.
L:  Yeah.  So, the subject is family?
R:  Yeah.  So, what, ah -- what do think about -- what does family mean to you?
L:  Well, our family's very important to me.
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  Yeah, I have, ah, two sisters and a brother --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, um, [LIPSMACK] ah, yeah, it really is.  I gotta say that, um, I'm probably, ah -- like when I'm away from them I miss them, ah --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- um, we're -- we're close.
R:  Wow.  Yeah, me too.  My -- I'm living in Seattle, but my -- my father and my mother and my sister are both living -- ah, all live in New Orleans and they're coming to visit actually tomorrow, and --
L:  I'm sorry.
R:  They're actually coming to visit tomorrow and --
L:  Oh, okay.  So, you're happy?
R:  -- I haven't seen them -- yeah, I'm very happy.  I haven't seen them for almost a year now, and so --
L:  Oh, really?  Where do they live at?
R:  New Orleans, Louisiana.
L:  Oh, okay.  Is that where you were born?
R:  Yeah, that's where I'm -- grew up and everything.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But, um, yeah, it's been pretty nice out here.  Like I take care of like my friend's kids every now and then, and it's pretty good --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- by community --
L:  Were you close with them growing up?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, definitely.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I was definitely really close to the family, so --
L:  What do you think about how, ah, kids are now with, um, ah, you know, some -- some people don't even talk to their parents?
R:  Yeah, totally.  I -- I have a lot -- actually know some people who have really bad relationships with their -- with their family and stuff, and it's really too bad, but a lot of the times there's just been like a lot of -- I guess it's been -- they've just gone through periods of like heavy, like, emotional [LAUGH] abuse and stuff, and that's like --
L:  Absolutely, yeah.
R:  -- and so there- there's a lot of resentment, and it's a really strange dynamic, you know, like parents and children and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- responsibility and -- and stuff like that, and so -- I don't know.
L:   Mm.  No, I understand.
R:  So, see, ah, I definitely feel like it's been a really big part of my life and really important to have a good relationship with my folks, but definitely --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- understand other people's frustrations and stuff.
L:  No, I understand, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um -- um, well, at -- tell me about like when you -- do you have any, ah, relatives like you'd consider family, that really aren't family?
R:  Yeah, I definitely have some friends who have actually have their own children now and we all live in pretty much the same area, and so I help them like take care of their kids, and stuff --
L:  Oh, wonderful, uh-huh.
R:  -- like that, and I definitely feel like I'm a part -- well, not a part of their family, but that we're in a family together, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I definitely have like put a lot of energy in trying to make that the word family or whatever --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- like that relationship much more broader than what I was --
L:  Yeah, I understand, yeah.
R:  -- taught, you know?
L:  Well, um, that's -- that's good.  I have, ah -- ah, some people that they're not, um -- um, blood relatives, but I consider them --
R:  Right.
L:  -- very close.
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  Yeah.  And how long have you done this kind of surveys?  Do you do them a lot, or ...?
R:  [LAUGH] Well, actually I had a friend whose from New York City who heard about it, and just emailed all of us, and it's like, "Easy way to make thirty dollars if you want", [LAUGH] and so --
L:  Oh, yeah.  Did you ever -- I mean, I guess you can only make, um, ah, you know -- you can only make thirty right?
R:  Yeah, you can only do it three times I believe.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But --
L:  Yeah.  Ah --
R:  Do you do it pretty often or something?
L:  No, I can only do it -- this is my, ah, last time I can do it I think.
R:  Oh, really?  Cool.
L:  Yeah, the other topics were sports, compensation for athletes, and the other one was, um, [LIPSMACK] travel or something.
R:  Yeah, I did one -- this is my second one, and I did one on --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- which country do you think is the biggest threat to American safety --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- or something like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, anyway.
L:  Yeah.  Um, well, I'm glad that, ah, you know, they have this type of thing because it does -- I wonder if they're like asking like how the dialect or something.  I don't know what they're getting at here.
R:  Yeah, it's linguistics.  So, I -- I guess it's just about -- I guess they're going to study each sentence and like pause it and like put spaces in between and, um, analyze how we interact with one another [LAUGH] I guess -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- as strangers.  It's pretty interesting I bet.
L:  Well, I -- I -- yeah, I think that it's good that they're interacting in -- all over the country, because I don't know -- New Orleans, how come you don't have an accent?
R:  Um, it's pretty metropolitan actually, and I remember when I grew up with, um, not -- very few people I knew actually had a very hard southern accent, and I spent most of like my teens up in, um, Massachusetts actually, so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- maybe that has something to do with it.  But even when I was growing up in New Orleans --
L:  Oh, right.  Because you sound -- I -- I know -- I've been to New Orleans quite a --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- several times, and there was certainly a different, um -- a different way of, ah, [LIPSMACK] -- ah, speaking down there.
R:  Yeah, there definitely is.
L:  Yeah, mm.
R:  But --
L:  So, ah, do you, um, ah, do any other surveys, or [MN], oh, excuse me.  
R:  Oh, no.  Gesundheit.  No, I haven't really done any of these before.  It's actually the first thing I've ever done --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but --
L:  Mhm.  No, I understand.
R:  Cool.
L:  So -- yeah, that sounds like a, um, [LIPSMACK] that -- you know, that you're interested in your family and stuff --
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  -- they're coming tomorrow.
R:  Yeah.  I definitely think that it's actually been like a part of a lot of people struggle to like try to broaden their definition of having kids.  Very few people actually fit in -- not very few, but there's definitely a lot of exceptions to -- to like -- to people being married, or like whatever --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, it's definitely been like a big -- big issue.  At least people always talk about how they were abused and about how other people should -- or -- or deserve to -- to use the word family at length --
L:  Why?
R:  -- should [inaudible].
L:  I'm very respectful with families.  Like there- --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there's a -- somebody says to me, "Look, you know, I can't go out, ah, my family's coming over", or something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I -- I understand that.
R:  Totally.
L:  Yeah, there's people that, um, like I said, I can't understand how some people cannot speak to their families for, ah -- ah years.  I don't know what happened, but I guess somebody got their feelings hurt.
R:  Yeah, definitely.  There -- every- everything's very heavy when it comes to family.  It's as if like all the small things, you know?
L:  Yes, I understand that.  Yeah.  Well, ah --
R:  Well, um --
L:  -- ah, do you have, ah -- you said you, um -- are you the oldest in your family?
R:  Yeah, I am.
L:  Yeah, how old are you now?
R:  Um, I'm actually nineteen.
L:  Oh, okay.  So, you have, ah, um, ah, younger brothers and sisters?
R:  Yeah, I have a younger sister, and she's nine years old.  She's very young.
L:  Oh.
R:  But --
L:  Well, it seems like you were very young, I didn't know if they -- I guess, ah -- I'm not getting personal like, maybe your parents are divorced or something?
R:  No, actually, um, I moved out of the -- my folk's house when I was about fifteen.  I was pretty young.
L:  Oh, okay.  All right.
R:  And moved to Massachusetts and lived with my aunt for a while.
L:  So, you were -- you --
R:  I was just having a lot of problems growing up in New Orleans.
L:  Do you feel better now about things?
R:  Oh, yeah, totally.  I definitely do.
L:  Mhm.  Well, that's good.  It looks like you're getting your, ah -- your -- whatever it needed back together again.
R:  Yeah.  Definitely needed some space, and then like -- actually when I -- when I left home like it helped a lot like for our relationship.  We definitely -- 
L:  [NOISE] I see.
R:  -- I feel like we -- we stopped taking each other for granted as much, you know?
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  And the space really helped [inaudible].
L:  What do you think this -- the -- just the year helped too?
R:  What's that?
L:  The year of not seeing them help?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well -- oh, this year?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, this year, no, not as much.  I mean, we- we've been having a really good relationship for a while now --
L:  Oh, I see -- I see.
R:  -- and I just like -- we just haven't had the chance or like time 'cause we're all working and stuff.
L:  Oh, [inaudible] how long are they staying?
R:  Um, for about a week.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  They're taking like their vacation this week -- or paid vacation --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- this week, so --
L:  Yeah.  Ah, do they still have that space needle out there?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's still out here.  Definitely.
L:  Do -- do people go up there?
R:  Uh-huh.  It costs a bit of money though.  It costs like thirty dollars or something to go up.
L:  [inaudible] Oh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I'm gonna go up there.  Do they still have, ah, that market place or something?
R:  Pike Market?
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah, it's -- it's still around.  It's definitely a pretty busy place.
L:  I was out there about ten years ago.  I -- I thought they'd have a science park --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, I remember that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, that was -- that was good.
R:  Yeah, Pike Market is a really nice place.  There's a pretty cool bookstore there.
L:  They have seafood and all there too, I remember.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, lots of food and lots of folks and stuff.  Really bustling all the time.
L:  Yeah.  And, ah, well with the -- with the family, do you think in the future, um, you'd want a big family or small family?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um --
L:  Like, say if you would get married, or not get married, but live with somebody whatever, would you have children?
R:  Ah, yeah, I'm thinking about it a lot actually.  Like, a lot of people that I'm close to are starting to have kids and things like that, and like seriously like settling down and everything and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I don't know.  I already consider myself part of like those families or whatever, and so, um, I don't know, I sort of picture myself already in this like big -- at least like group of people who -- who definitely take care of each other and everything, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And treat each other -- are just, ah -- are accountable and responsible for one another --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- which is something that -- that I definitely think that is pretty vital for -- for having any sort of family, you know?
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.  Well, it seems like you have, ah --
