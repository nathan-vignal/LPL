R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.  This is Susan.
R:  Hi.  This is Ganya[?].
L:  Oh, hi.  So, what do you think?  Do you think -- how can the government can, ah, s- -- do anything about the corporate scandals and the misbehavior?
R:  Well, they seem to be able to cut laws for everyone else so [LAUGH] I think they should probably figure out a way to prosecute the people who have been doing them.
L:  So, enforce the laws that we have?
R:  I mean, it seems like these people are, like, way breaking the law and then nothing happens to them.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  I think that ... [LAUGH] I mean, it seems like a really bad thing to do to take, you know, hundreds and thousands of people's money. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I guess these people have more money so it doesn't matter if they take other people's money.  I don't know.
L:  Well, they can't do anything as long as they keep getting bought by the people that have the money.
R:  Exactly. [LAUGH] So -- yeah.  It --
L:  And I don't know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- if they're just not only bought but if they're even threatened.
R:  Yeah.  Or -- or if they're the same people.
L:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  You know? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, especially -- I don't know.
L:  That's part of it too.
R:  You know, it's like -- but I think it lost -- I think that this was particularly bad round and I guess it's proba- -- I mean, I'm sure it's always been going on but, like, once, like, people, like, I -- I mean, I don't have money in the stock market or anything but, like, my dad, like, he invests all this money and then he sees all this happening, like, people are just never gonna do it again, you know?  So, it's so bad for the economy I think.
L:  Yeah.  Well, it's bad for everybody.  I mean, I have some money in mutual funds and it's, ah -- f- -- it's really made my share value go way down in the last couple a years and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, it's affected me that way.
R:  Yeah.  And it's -- it's not fair to you, you know?  You didn't do anything wrong.
L:  Yeah.  And it's not even in the companies that are involved.  It's just the whole stock market got affected.
R:  It's just 'cause everyone's just scared now because these people -- it's not like you saw, like, a change or, you know, new laws or people being prosecuted.  You just saw ...  I mean, they don't even arrest them.  Like, you know, they walk them out of their house calmly.  They don't, like, go into their house and arrest them in handcuffs or anything, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Well, I think the Bible says that, ah, when you steal from somebody you should just have to pay it back a- and not -- with interest and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I don't think the Bible advocates locking anybody up.  And besides, what can you do if you're locked up? [LAUGH] How can you pay anybody back and what good does that do to the victim if somebody's just locked up?
R:  Oh, no.  I know.
L:  Huh.
R:  But it just seems like --
L:  I think --
R:  -- there's just such a double standard with these corporate kinds where it's --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- not even like a big deal at all.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, they treat them as totally different than other people.  Like, if you were, say, a hungry person and you stole some bread, you'd be, you know --
L:  You'd be locked up.
R:  -- thrown around with handcuffs and put in jail for a really long time.
L:  Yeah.  And you should just be made to pay it back.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Instead.
R:  Yeah.  But --
L:  Get a job and pay it back.
R:  But these people, I don't know how they can pay it back.  I mean, how can they ... you know?
L:  Community service I guess.  I don't know.  I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when you're really in that bad a shape, I don't know.
R:  Because they -- they've -- what they've done --
L:  But --
R:  -- is -- yeah.  Like, people, like you who're -- you weren't invested in their companies but because consumer confidence is so low then you're [NOISE] -- you know, you're affected by it anyway.  So --
L:  Yeah.  How can they pay me back?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, the way that --
R:  But I think it's by l- -- it's by making -- I mean, obviously, the politicians are implicated in it but it's by making -- assuring people that it wouldn't happen again, you know?  Or that things are different now or that -- you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  If they had to pay back everything they stole plus, ah, four fold or whatever --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- then, ah --
R:  Then people might --
L:  -- that would help the economy for one thing.  And it would make a lotta people happy and it would f- -- it would raise everybody's share values on their mutual funds.
R:  Yeah.  It probably would, like, increase confidence again.
L:  Yeah.  And that's the big thing is -- but you know what?  I heard Rush Limbaugh say, a couple of days ago, that the recession is officially over now.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  And, ah, f- -- and this -- this has helped us.  Now, we're s- -- we weren't getting any work for a long time.  We're in self employed and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- freelancers and we d- didn't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- get work for a long time and our customers weren't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- paying us and today we've gotten all kinds of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- good news about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- somebody's gonna finally pay us what they owe and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and we're getting some more work and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That -- that has affected us --
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  -- in that way.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And it's really [LAUGH] -- we've --
R:  It's funny how, like, one guy saying that then makes it true, you know?
L:  Yeah.  Just 'cause he --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- said it now everybody --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And I don't know if it's just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- because he said it but he was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- looking at some other sources --
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  -- that's -- that verify that and I think a lotta people listen to him anyway.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But they also listen to the other sources that he was quoting.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So --
R:  Yeah.  It's, kind of -- but it is weird though I think in the stock market today that you have these, like, g- -- people on TV or whatever and they're, like, "Oh, it's a really bad day" and then nobody buys stocks and they're, like, "Oh, it's a great day -- buy stocks" and everyone buys stocks.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  You know?  And I was saying that, um, to someone else.  I was, like, "What if you, um, you know -- what if they just came out and they said it's fine -- buy stocks.  Everyone would do it again.  I don't understand why they don't" you know? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  And I think, to some extent, they do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think they don't, ah, tell you everything that's going on because they don't wanna f- -- create a crash.
R:  [SIGH] Ah.  I don't know.  It's very frustrating.  It does --
L:  But when they want to create something they know how to do it.
R:  Mhm.  So, what would you do to ch- -- differently?
L:  What would I do?
R:  You would make them pay it back and --
L:  I would make 'em pay it back.  Yeah.  That would be my solution because that's what the Bible says and it still preserves everybody's freedom --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- which is really a high --
R:  Oh, I agree.  I don't wanna throw anyone in jail.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I'm totally against that.
L:  And, I mean, unless what they did to somebody was to s- -- put them in a dungeon or something that -- illegally --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- then they should get back exactly what they gave.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But when you steal something, the solution is to pay it back.  That -- that pays back the person that -- that was victimized and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and then it makes the guy -- it makes it, um, non profitable to steal.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's profitable to steal now because you can get away with what you stole.  So --
R:  But it seems like they're not even being found guilty, are they?  I mean, are they getting off with these fancy lawyers and stuff?
L:  Oh, w- -- you know, I haven't really been following what's actually happening to them.
R:  I'm sure a lot of them are and they're covering for each other.
L:  I know they're resigning from their jobs though. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, [MN] -- whatever.  With --
L:  A- --
R:  -- ten million dollars siphons to leave.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh. [SIGH] [NOISE]
L:  M- --
R:  It makes you so mad.  Like --
L:  Martha Stewart --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just stepped down s- --
R:  Yeah.  I heard that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  She might go to jail though.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But she would go to jail I think [NOISE] -- I mean, she's like a w- -- a successful woman who, you know, everyone, sort of, is envious of whereas these, like, c- -- men who we never heard of before, like, they seem to just be getting away with it.  I don't know.  It seems like there's, kind of, a double standard for her too.
L:  Yeah.  It could be.
R:  She's all over the papers, you know?
L:  Yeah.  Just 'cause she's a woman who made it.
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.  People --
L:  So, they have to cut that down.
R:  Yeah.  That's what it seems like.  I -- like, I -- I -- I don't like making fun of her really.  I think I'm sensitive about it for that reason.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Whereas these other people, like the head of Enron or whatever, I would have no problem just really, like, thinking that he's a bad person.  I don't know.  For some reason I have a different take on her.  I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And when you think about the Enron thing, well, that wasn't just a stock thing but some of the stuff that they did, ah, effected the electric rates in -- in that part of the country.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, it's just people, like --
L:  It really ripped people off.
R:  -- trying to make -- pay their electricity bill, you know?  And it's -- it's also, like, that's in really hot areas where people have air conditioning and need it, you know?  Or ...
L:  And who knows how many people died because they were over heated.
R:  I know.  I mean, oh, [SIGH] how could you have that on your conscience?  It seems impossible, you know?  But I guess they just hide under the shield of the corporation and money and stuff.
L:  Yeah.  They're gonna stand before God though.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, they should stand here too. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Even if they don't stand here, they're still gonna stand before God and that's for eternity. [LAUGH]
R:  I guess that's one way of looking at it, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Probably helps get through --
L:  I think that might --
R:  -- when you see injustice like that.
L:  If we could get that idea into the government that whatever you do, you're gonna stand before God, I think that would help with, ah, f- -- eliminate a lot of this stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If people really believed that you're gonna stand before God m- -- and t- -- make an account for everything that you did --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and be judged.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think that would, ah, s- -- curb a lot of it.  And I think that in p- -- in the past, it did curb a lot of it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And the -- and that's our problem now is that n- nobody believes there is a God or, at least, th- they don't think he's, ah, going to judge them or they're gonna let him --
R:  Well, see, I don't know because, like, I don't -- I mean, I was raised a little bit religious but I don't really think about God that much but I still, like, try very hard to do -- be a really good person here on earth, you know, because I don't really think about the afterlife but I see people suffering now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I hate that, you know?  So, I think that some people just need to be responsible or care about other people.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, and maybe not with s- -- like, being -- I feel funny, like, threatening people with the afterlife but just, kind of, look around.  Like, try to think of what the person's going through, you know?  Tr- -- like, what a- -- why would you take their food or their electricity?  God, that's horrible.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Well, that's another part of -- of believing in God because if you don't believe that God created us in his image then, ah, f- -- what value is any human being?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Why -- why should we care how somebody else suffers?
R:  Well, I guess I -- I mean, I just see us all as people that are similar.  I -- I mean, I don't think of h- how God created us in his image or I don't really ... but I do see other people and I know that they're human like me or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, I can tell that.
L:  Well, you're unusual. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Most people, when there's no God, it just dismantles everything else. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, ah, that's because of our nature.  We're just, kinda -- well, I think that might be the end of it there.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Are you still there?  Oh, I heard a click.
R:  No.  No.  They'll -- they'll come back --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- and tell us.  Have you done this before?
L:  Yeah.  This is my third.  Actually, it's my fourth.  I ended up taking my -- one of my husband's calls yesterday but --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Hopefully, you'll still get it. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I- --
L:  Oh, yeah.  It's no problem.  They know about --
