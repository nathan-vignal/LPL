L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hey, how are you?
R:  Hi, good.
L:  All right.  Ah, my name is Mark.
R:  I'm Vanessa.
L:  Hey Vanessa.
R:  Hi.
L:  This is kind of tricky.
R:  I know.
L:  [LAUGH] Um --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- is this your first one?
R:  No, it's my second.
L:  Oh, see, I'm being devirginized here.
R:  Uh-oh.
L:  Um, don't worry, um, don't cry, um --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so, I guess the topic is fam- -- where are you from?
R:  Um, I'm from Louisiana.  I live in Minnesota.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.  I'm in Los Angeles.
R:  Oh.
L:  [NOISE] So, yeah, it's hot.
R:  Huh.
L:  Very hot.
R:  Is it?  Oh, it's really nice here, cool.
L:  Ah, it's like ninety degrees.
R:  Uh.
L:  But, so wait, so the topic is what family means to you.
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay, why don't you start?
R:  Mm [LAUGH] oh great.  Um, well, I guess I don't think of family as just your blood relatives, you know.  I have --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- people that I'm not actually related to that have been -- become like family to me --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- um, my mother's best friend, I call her my aunt because, you know, I knew her from when I was a kid and --
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  Yeah, so I can --
L:  How old are you?
R:  Thirty five.
L:  Oh, wow, you're old --
R:  How old are you?
L:  I'm just -- I'm so kidding, I'm thirty --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- two.
R:  Okay.  What about you?
L:  Ah, family?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, that's funny, I don't really think of it like that.  I think more of it from the standpoint of just blood relatives --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, I've got a lot of friends who I'm very close with --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, um, they're all friends.  [LAUGH] I don't know, I'm just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm pretty clear on the delineation I suppose, but I didn't have, like, you kn-, I didn't have, like, family members with friends when I grew up that were, you know, really close with us I suppose, like that --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- I mean, I have one, but I mean, we're sort of out of touch now and everything, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't really think about it that way, but, I mean, are you close with your family?
R:  Um, yeah, I guess so.  I mean we -- we live in different states, my mum's in Colorado, my dad's in Louisiana still --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- so I -- you know, I see 'em only about, you know, every few years or so, um --
L:  Which could be a good thing.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- believe me, it's kind of nice to not live in the same state as your parents, you know --
L:  Oh, yeah, I live in -- in L.A., they're in Vegas.  They live in Nevada --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- my parents --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it's exactly the perfect amount of distance as far as I'm concerned.
R:  Yeah, it's nice, 'cause then, you know, you visit them when you want to, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they're not sticking their noses in your life all the time.
L:  Exactly.  Well, Vegas is a forty five minute flight from L.A. --
R:  Oh, that's not bad at all.
L:  -- or a four hour drive, so, yeah, exact-, it's just right at the zone where, you know, when you're at college, it's close enough to bring your laundry --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, you know, you can still do whatever you want, ha.
R:  But not close enough so they can say, " When are you going to come visit.  When are you going to come visit?"
L:  You know, the grandparents handle that.
R:  Oh.
L:  But I go back a lot, I mean, I'd either drive to Vegas back and forth just, I don't know, every couple of months, easily, so, I mean, it's a four hour drive and I'm really used to it at this point.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, do you have a -- are you married?
R:  No.
L:  Okay, yeah, me neither.  That probably significantly changes our viewpoint on family also.
R:  Yeah. If -- when you don't, you know, have an actual one, and I don't have any kids either, so --
L:  Oh, that's great.
R:  I know [LAUGH] it's really is.
L:  Good for you.
R:  I'm not having any either, so --
L:  That's awesome.  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  How --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- come?
R:  I don't know, they just, you know, mm, it's just too much responsibility.
L:  Too much snot.
R:  I like my freedom.  I like my peace and quiet.
L:  Oh, my god, if she were not in L.A. I'd date you.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I [LAUGH] I mean, I am seriously --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I just got in a big argument with my girlfriend about this very topic, so it's, like, god --
R:  What, she wants to have kids?
L:  No, no -- no, I -- w- we've only been seeing each other for like three months, four months --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- but, um, no, she's, like, really, like, very, very time sensitive --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- and wants to get together all the time and I'm very, very independent, every girl I've ever --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- dated, it's always been, like, "Let's get together like two or three days a week maximum" --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and sh- she's just flipping out on this.  She's like, "I --"
R:  Oh.
L:  -- want to spend every waking minute with you".  I'm, like, "N- n- no you're not".
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, no.
L:  It's not going to occur.
R:  Huh.
L:  So, yeah, it's put a lot of pressure on the two of us.  Well, we're totally getting off topic, but it's interesting.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Have you ever been married?
R:  No.
L:  Yeah, me neither.
R:  Are you -- do you want to?
L:  What do you do for a living?  Ah, yeah, maybe sometime.
R:  Yeah, that's what I say, you know, if it happens it happens, if it doesn't, it doesn't.
L:  Yeah, I like being alone a lot.
R:  Yeah.  I -- yeah, I grew up pretty much as an only child, so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I'm used to being alone a lot, you know, and --
L:  That's cool.
R:  -- I can get stir crazy if I don't -- if I'm around people for too long of a period of time.
L:  No, I'm -- I'm exactly -- exactly the same way --
R:  That's --
L:  -- like it just freaks me out, if -- it's like if I'm over, you know -- there's a girl I'm dating -- over at her place overnight or something --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like I've just got to get out and get home and check my email and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- make some calls and that sort of thing, you know, I just start --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- freaking out.
R:  Huh.
L:  So, um, ah, what do you do for a living?
R:  Um, I work for an H.M.O. in accounts --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- payable department.
L:  Oh, very cool, yeah so --
R:  What do you do?
L:  -- you have your own career and everything going on.  I work in --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- computer software, but not really --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- right now, I also am doing some projects for NBC.
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, so, yeah, that's a whole day discussion, it's way, way, way off topic, but --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  -- but yeah, I've --I mean I used to work for Microsoft and Disney --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and stuff like that, so -- been around the block on that, so it's like, you know, I'm so much more concerned with my career and that stuff too.  
R:  Yeah, I suppose --
L:  So, um, see -- let's see, so you don't talk -- how often do you talk with your family?
R:  Um, well, my mum just got a computer, so --
L:  [COUGH] Oh, yeah.
R:  -- she's really -- really getting into email now, she's thrilled with it.
L:  That's great.
R:  So, yeah, so it's nice 'cause I'd rather talk --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- through emails than on the phone anyway, and it's cheaper.
L:  Totally true.
R:  Yeah.  So, yeah, we've been talking, you know, at least every other day or so on email.
L:  Oh, that's great.
R:  And my dad -- my dad I talk to, you know, every -- probably every couple of weeks or so.
L:  Oh, not as co- -- are -- are they together?
R:  No.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  No, they've been divorced since I was a toddler, so --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah, he's remarried and --
L:  Do you think that affects your desire to be married?
R:  Well, both of 'em have been through multiple marriages, so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- yeah, I -- I suppose that kind of, ah [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- takes -- takes away your faith in marriage and --
L:  That's pretty funny.
R:  -- relationships, yeah.
L:  'Cause mines the exact opposite, my parents have been together forever --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- and they really love each other still, they're, like, in their sixties and they're --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- they're really close, but at the same time it's like they're very independent, they just both do their own things and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- sometimes they get together, so I've seen it work from that standpoint --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's why I like being alone and independent all my time --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- which is weird, you know.
R:  You have to find someone that's as independent as you are but is also willing -- you know, wants --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to spend time with you, you know --
L:  Yeah, well I didn't.
R:  -- you have to find a balance.
L:  Well the hard part, you know, that's harder for a guy to find in a girl than the other way around I think.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because men are socialized to be independent.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Women are socialized to be relying upon a man generally.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I -- I don't think that's the right way to be obviously, I don't like that in a woman, but I'm just saying that --
R:  No.
L:  -- like, I -- you know, because if you're not married you're a failure if you're a woman, but if you're not married --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- as a guy you're a stud.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You, know, it's like -- it's -- it's such B.S., so I -- I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, it's -- and it can be easier for you to find a guy like that, but then a guy, in general, would be very intimidated by you actually, being that independent, I'm sure.
R:  Well, I suppose, yeah, it's -- I think the times are changing though, I know a lot more people that are deciding not to have children.
L:  Hm, that's cool.
R:  'Cause, I've been -- I've been preaching that gospel for years, you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- people say, "Oh, when you meet the right man", you know, it's like, oh, you know, is it -- when I meet the right man, I've -- I've seen relationships suffer once people have kids because the woman usually becomes so focused on the child that she completely forgets that she has a husband, and the husband doesn't really seem to bond with the child that much and --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- it just kind of, you know --
L:  Oh, no, I want to be real close to my kids if I ever have any --
R:  Well, that's good.
L:  -- it's -- it's just more to me that it sh- -- it's not the default.  If it happens, cool, if it doesn't I don't consider that a loss.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, but it -- not -- I mean -- that's interesting too that in the mid west I would think it would be harder to have that attitude than, you know, in -- in L.A. or something where everybody's so much more, you know, I don't want to say --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't even know what the right term is -- the career oriented or whatever I suppose.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, not the traditional mid west, you know, attitude like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's pretty cool, um.
R:  So, I -- yeah, I've had friends change their minds that they used to say yeah, they, we probably gonna have kids someday and I think a lot of people say that just because it's kind of expected of you, to get married and have kids, that's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the American dream and -- but I think a lot of people, you know, now that very friend, you know, she and her husband talked about it and just said, well, you know, we're happy with our lives, we have dogs and --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- [LAUGH] you know, like, ah, children are just, you know, they're just --
L:  A pain in the butt.
R:  -- annoying, yeah, they're a lot --
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  -- of work and I like --
L:  But isn't there -- oh, sorry.
R:  -- peace and quiet.
L:  The only thing that gets me though is, this is like a really good plan for now, like that you and I have --
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- but, like, when you're seventy --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- that you wonder then, like, "Oh crap, [LAUGH] you know --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- it's too late now".
R:  Well, you know, yeah, my mum says that, "Well, you know, who's going to take care of you when you're older?"  It's like, "Well, I don't want to have a kid just so I have somebody to take care of me".
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I know.
R:  I mean, that's -- that's not a good reason to have a child.
L:  I'm just seeing loneliness as your friends start dying --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and stuff.  I mean, that's a realistic thing that'll happen at some point, you know --
R:  Oh, I guess.
L:  -- unless you go first.  That's the concern.
R:  But then again, you know, we like, also like being alone, so --
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  -- you know, I don't think it'll be that, um, that much of a big deal.
L:  Yeah, but you sound like you're also sociable despite that, though --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, it's not like you're a spinster living in your cave, so --
R:  No, I mean, I like hanging with my friends and doing stuff, but, you know, I'm also, I'm fairly quiet, so I -- you know, I don't like hanging out in bars and stuff but, ah --
L:  That's cool.
R:  -- I like getting together with my friends and then I like spending time alone too.
L:  Yeah, I -- I -- but you need that balance or -- or it gets -- gets tipped way too out of whack I think.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  You know -- what a great discussion --
