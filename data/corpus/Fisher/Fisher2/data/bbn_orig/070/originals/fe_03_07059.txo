R:  Hi.  My name is Barbara.
L:  Hi.  I'm Laurie.
R:  Laurie?  Where are you?

L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Where in New Jersey?
L:  Um, Hopatcong.
R:  Oh.
L:  Sussex County.
R:  Uh-huh.  We -- we have a summer place down on Long Beach Island that we're gong Friday. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, very nice.
R:  And I, um -- I went to high school in New Jersey at St Cecelia's in Englewood, New Jersey.
L:  Oh --
R:  So --
L:  -- okay.  Yeah.  I know Englewood.
R:  Yeah.  So, we're supposed to talk about what family means to us?
L:  Family means to us.
R:  Yup.  Well --
L:  Ah --
R:  -- do you have a large family or ...?
L:  I have a very large family.
R:  Oh.  We have a very small family. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?
R:  I have -- we have two children but our parents are gone, um, aunts and uncles no more and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um -- um, my son is married and has twin boys --
L:  Oh, boy.
R:  -- but my daughter isn't married so we, you know -- there's just a few of us but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but we're all -- we all live right here, right in the area so that makes it nice.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  Yeah.  How --
L:  W- --
R:  -- about you?
L:  I'm one of six.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah.  I have a sister, four brothers.  Um, [LIPSMACK] my mom actually -- I h- -- I own a -- a mother daughter home and she lives with me.
R:  Oh, that's great.
L:  Um, so it's good 'cause she's --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- real sick.
R:  And how about all the -- oh, she's sick?
L:  Yeah.  She's --
R:  Oh.
L:  She's got emphysema.
R:  Oh, that's what --
L:  And, ah --
R:  That's what my mother had.  Yeah.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Well, is your m- -- was your mother a smoker or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is she?  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  She was a very heavy smoker.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm.
R:  Well, my mother stopped smoking several years before --
L:  Right.
R:  -- ah, she really got sick with -- from the emphysema but, ah ...  Ah, and your brothers and sisters are -- are they all nearby?
L:  Um, I have ... let's see -- my sister, she's about half an hour away --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I guess.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  One brother -- he's about an hour away.  Um, I have a brother who's only about ten minutes away but we don't see him.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I have a brother in Colorado and a brother in West Virginia.
R:  Oh, so you're, kinda, spread around but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the majority nearby and you can get together and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, ah, holidays et cetera.
L:  Yeah.  We try to -- we try to do Christmas at least.
R:  Yeah.  I usually --
L:  Um --
R:  -- have Christmas here and, ah, it's -- ah, Christmas Eve and then --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they're free to do whatever [LAUGH] they want to on --
L:  That's what we do.
R:  -- Christmas Day --
L:  We do Christmas Eve.
R:  -- and -- and I do nothing. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's nice. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So, we al- -- my husband and I always say we- -- you know, "We'll just eat the leftovers from Christmas Eve and I won't have to cook on Christmas Day".  So --
L:  It's your turn. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  You [LAUGH] can't -- it's --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- your p- -- turn to have some peace.
R:  Yes.  Yes.  But --
L:  Well, we usually do -- I have two small kids and I said, "After I have children, I'm staying home --"
R:  Right.
L:  "-- for Christmas".
R:  I did that too.
L:  Because I can't -- when they were tiny it was okay but now they're two and a half and four and a half then there's no way I can --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- drag them out of here on [LAUGH] Christmas Day.
R:  No.  I -- when I was a little girl, my parents always, ah, took us off to visit our relatives, um, a few hundred miles away and we had to leave all of our toys and everything and I said --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I would never do that to my kids --
L:  No.  M- m- --
R:  -- and I never did.  They -- we were always home, ah --
L:  No.
R:  -- for Christmas, you know, so that they could play with their things.  So --
L:  Oh, good.
R:  But have you had many of these calls?
L:  Um, this is actually the second one that I've been able to take.
R:  Uh-huh.  I --
L:  The -- a long time ago, um, I had done another one.
R:  Oh.  I -- I did one right after I signed up and then just a few days ago, the topic was the Middle East and I --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Oh, b- -- [LAUGH]
L:  That must've been pretty interesting. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Except that, I think, I was thinking more of Israel and Palestine's problems and the woman I was talking to was thinking more about Iraq.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I'm really not sure which they wanted us to talk about or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or both.  So --
L:  Or av- -- yeah.  What --
R:  But --
L:  Maybe that's what they wanted to know who -- 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- what -- what comes to mind.
R:  But certainly, we're talking about family and what it means to you, it -- it means a great deal.  Both of our children are adopted --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and I can't imagine what it would be like not to have any.
L:  Wow.
R:  You know?  That -- one was three weeks old and one was six weeks old when we got them.
L:  Were they from the -- the same family?
R:  N- no.  No.  Uh-uh.
L:  Different families?
R:  No.  Um, they -- and they were -- they're t- -- a couple of years apart but they --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- were both babies when we got them and it --
L:  Oh.
R:  I -- I -- I just can't imagine what it'd be, like, well -- you certainly [LAUGH] know with two little ones --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like that and how much joy they bring to your life.
L:  Yeah.  I w- -- I --
R:  So --
L:  I often say -- I sit back and even an- -- when they're driving me insane I sit --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- back and think, "What would I -- what did I do when I didn't have children?"
R:  That's right.
L:  You know, I --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- can't -- I can't think of what I did that was so [LAUGH] important.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But -- yeah.  It's [PAUSE] -- oh, that's my phone.  Um --
R:  [LAUGH] A- another phone? [LAUGH]
L:  It's -- yeah.  My other -- my phone's beeping.  Um, yeah.  I -- I have -- we try [inaudible] our family, you know -- the kids, um, try --
R:  A- --
L:  -- to keep 'em together and try to keep them respectful.
R:  Mhm.  You- you're, ah, sisters and brothers, ah, I mean, they all have, um, children that --
L:  Most of them do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, my brother who's the young- -- um, closest to my age -- there's a fourteen year difference but he's the closest to my age -- he -- he doesn't have any children.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  My sister has two -- she's got a son who's twenty four and a daughter who's twenty one.  Um, who's next?
R:  Oh, so you're the baby, huh?
L:  I'm the baby baby.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Big, big, big baby. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  So, there- there's a lot.  There's, um -- I think there's thirteen grandchildren and seventeen great grandchildren --
R:  Oh, boy.
L:  -- from my mom.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  So, she's the -- she's the matriarch.  She's the queen.
R:  Yeah.  And well --
L:  She's the queen bee.
R:  We got -- we got, kind of, a late start so [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  W- we don't ha- -- th- -- g- -- I will -- I don't think I'll ever see great [LAUGH] grandchildren.
L:  Oh, you never know.  Well --
R:  Well --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  My grand- -- my grandsons are, ah, thirteen.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, um, I -- I -- well, who knows? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Right.
R:  May or may not.  So, well I enjoyed talking to you.  I, um, I don't know that we solved the problems of the world but --
L:  I don't know.
R:  [LAUGH] Are you -- where did you find out about Fisher?
L:  Um, I did online -- I'm -- I --
R:  Refunds?
L:  Um, no.  Actually, I found it through, um, mystery shopping.
R:  Oh.  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, money and shopping dot com.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I signed up for them and it was through them that I -- I had gotten the, um, referral --
R:  Oh.  Ah, 'cause --
L:  -- for Fisher.
R:  -- both of the people that I talked to before had gotten it from the Refunds s- -- Make Cents.  You know, the magazine?
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Um, you pay twelve dollars a year to -- to, ah, join it.
L:  Oh.
R:  And, um, oh, you- -- it's incredible the amount of information there.
L:  That's where you got it from too?
R:  Yeah.  It's Refunds Cents -- C.E.N.T.S. --
L:  Right.
R:  -- dot com.  You should take a look at it.
L:  I will.
R:  'Cause sh- -- y- -- there's parts of it that you can see without h- having to pay for it.
L:  Oh.
R:  And, um, y- -- oh, you wouldn't believe the information that you get.
L:  Well, I'll definitely --
R:  A- --
L:  -- look at it.
R:  A- --
L:  I'm always looking for coupons.
R:  E- -- oh.  It -- th- this has -- this -- this is amazing.  She publishes a magazine that has all the refunds in it.  I w- -- started doing refunds in nineteen sixty nine --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and, um -- and then, you know, when it started so that you had to send register receipts with everything would just -- it just got too --
L:  Too much?
R:  Too impossible.
L:  Right.
R:  So -- but.
L:  Wow.  I never -- a couple of times if there's a big refund, I take advantage of it but I -- I never bo- -- like, 'cause like you said, you have to send a UPC and you have --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to send a register receipt and I always forget.
R:  Y- --
L:  I forget to keep the UPC --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- or I forget something.
R:  Or there's two things on the same register receipt and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  They've -- they're making it difficult now but years ago, it -- it was really great.  I would, sometimes, do as many as three hundred refunds in a month.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  I had a whole room in the house full of lab- -- of alphabetically filed trash. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's, like, a little business.
R:  Y- y- yes.  Yeah.  It was.
L:  Off the side business almost.
R:  And when the kids were little it gave me something to do, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- when they -- when they were sleeping or when they were in school or whatever.  So --
L:  Oh.  I'll definitely have to check that one out.
R:  Anyway.  Well, I -- I hope your -- your mom, ah, can improve from this, ah, emphysema thing and --
L:  Yeah.  W- -- right now, she's in the -- she's about in the final stage.
R:  Oh.  Oh, dear.
L:  So, um --
R:  Is she on oxygen --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- all the time?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  She's on -- she's been on twenty four hour ox- -- well, four years ago, she had part of her lung removed because of lung cancer.
R:  Oh.  Hm.
L:  And, um, we didn't -- I mean, we figured -- the doctor at that point said, you know, she had, maybe, six months.
R:  Oh.  S- --
L:  But that was --
R:  And that was four years?
L:  -- four years ago.
R:  Wow.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And your dad?
L:  He died in ninety six --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- of, um -- actually, he died of pneumonia but he went -- it was his, ah, heart --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- that put him in the hospital.
R:  Wow.  Hm.
L:  But -- yeah.  He died so that's why my mom lives with us.
R:  Uh-huh.  Well, does --
L:  'Cause she didn't wanna be alone and --
R:  Yeah.  That's -- yeah.  My mother was with us for the last year and a half or so o- of her life but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- prior to that, she was only three or four miles away so --
L:  Oh.
R:  But, um, yeah.  She had oxygen, ah, all the h- -- [SIGH] one of those machines.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is that what your mom has?
L:  She has a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- concentrator.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  And --
L:  She has a concentrator and her portable in case we ever take her anywhere.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  Um, and tons of medicine.
R:  Yeah.  Well, j- --
L:  And luckily, her -- she's eighty three so her memory is really bad but for her, it's an asset because she forgets she's so sick.
R:  Oh.  Yeah.
L:  So, it's, kind of -- it's, kind of, a blessing that her memory is so bad, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because she forgets when she has episodes.
R:  Hm.
L:  So, it's --
R:  Oh.  And she's fortunate 'cause she can have the children -- I mean, they must be a great joy to her --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- a couple of little ones like that.
L:  They keep her going.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They definitely --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- keep her busy.
R:  Yeah. Hm.
L:  It's funny. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] [LIPSMACK] But --
L:  But, um -- yeah.  So, that's -- that's my family.  I --
R:  Well, I enjoyed talking to you and, um, let's -- I don't know how many of the -- did --
