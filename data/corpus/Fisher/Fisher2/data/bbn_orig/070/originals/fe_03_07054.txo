R:  Hi, my name is Rae.
L:  Hi Rae.  Ah, my name is David.  How are you doing today?
R:  Okay.  How about yourself?
L:  Very well.
R:  So, David, where are you calling from?
L:  I'm in, ah, New Jersey.
R:  Oh, New Jersey --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- wow, okay.
L:  And yourself?
R:  I'm on the other side of the world [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- in California.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  In L.A.
L:  Very good.  So, I guess it's about, ah, three o'clock there?
R:  Oh, yeah, three fifty nine.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, four o'clock.
L:  Oh, okay, four o'clock.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Right.
R:  So, what are you guys up to over there?  How's the weather?
L:  Oh, we're -- we've been, ah -- we've been having pretty poor weather actually, um, well, ah, it's raining today.  Ah, it's been raining, ah, perpetually for the last like five or six weekends --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- um, we're going down, ah -- we're having a little short vacation going to the Jersey shore starting tomorrow through, ah, Sunday --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and it looks like we're going to have some more rains down there too, so, ah, not the best timing --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- not the best timing.
R:  Huh.
L:  How about yourself?
R:  Well, for here, ah, it had actually been warm for a couple of days, but the last, ah, few days it's been kind of overcast --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I suppose I shouldn't complain --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- we have no tornados, no hurricanes --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- no floods.  [LAUGH] 
L:  You get your share of mudslides every once in a while don't you, in Los Angeles?
R:  Ah, mudslides?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mudslides.  Are those like the really big ones?
L:  Yeah.  I guess it's a little more north that you live with, ah, in the news a few years ago.
R:  Yeah, um, what we have here that's annoying are these little -- they're little teeny tiny flies, but if they land on you, they sting.
L:  Mm.
R:  Those things actually bite --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- so we get those, and then, ah, we get like these little fruit flies.  I mean, they -- I don't know, they can detect something from, ah -- ah, so many miles away --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- but you leave a thing out, you know, like you cut an apple open, next thing you know, bam [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- they're right there.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Are you a -- a life long Los Angeles -- Los Angelino?
R:  Yeah.  Actually born and raised here --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- however, unfortunately my city has gone down --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- on a slippery slope [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, ah, 'cause we're just getting so many people here, it's like super crowed and --
L:  Yeah, uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, every time when you see on the news and they're showing the footage [LAUGH] of the freeways being crowded --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- that's not an exaggeration, that's a daily occurrence.
L:  Yeah, I know, man, I can't imagine that.  
R:  Ah, no.
L:  I mean, I can't imagine putting up with it for a long time.
R:  And with no real -- I mean, we -- they just now started to try to make some kind of public transportation thing.  It's not, ah -- it's not really complete.  There's not that many places where the thing goes --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, you basically have to have a car because everything is so far and spread out apart --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that you just cannot walk --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and don't talk about cabs.  You'd better have your phone book with you, because you have to call those people.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Not like, I guess in New York and those kind of places where you can just wave them down --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh-uh, we don't have that here.
L:  Oh, you don't, really?
R:  No.  You have to have your book and your cell phone and call them.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, man.  That's kind of -- I'm surprised that works at all actually.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, that's the weird thing, which I don't exactly understand why.  For some reason, taxi cabs never really took off here for some -- I -- I mean, I don't know why --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I guess maybe 'cause it's just so expensive or something.
L:  Yeah.  I can -- I can see that it's, you know, the city's kind of -- I mean I'm only going from a -- a layman's understanding that it is a pretty spread out city, so any time you take a cab it probably would cost a fortune when you think --
R:  Yeah, that's true.  So, not that many people are using the cabs unfortunately --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so that's the problem there, and --
L:  Do you -- do you live actually within the city limits, or just on the outside suburb- suburbian[?] areas or anything like that?
R:  No, I'm actually, ah, in -- I'm in like the north eastern part of Los Angeles --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- in, um, I'm not sure if you're familiar with any of the little small places, but we have like Hollywood --
L:  Yeah, sure.
R:  -- yeah, so, I'm on the very east end of Hollywood, which is like a little area called Silverlake[?] --
L:  Okay, mhm.
R:  -- Ophelus[?], so I'm in that side of town --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um --
L:  Okay.  My -- my perception is that's a -- a pretty nice area.
R:  Yeah, actually it's -- overall it's, ah, pretty good --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but if you need public transportation --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- well, good luck.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, okay, I guess, ah, about a couple or two or three years ago, we do have a substation of that metro thing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's about a mile away from here.  So, in order to get to it, you've gotta take a bus --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- or you have to walk a mile to get to that train --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and that thing only goes -- it goes like in north Hollywood to like Universal Studios, like Lanchersham[?] --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- it goes about maybe -- ah, from my house that's about ten or twelve miles --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- so, it goes that way.  And then if you go the other way towards downtown L.A. --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's about another three or four miles.  So, you can see it's not that big.  I mean --
L:  And you're --
R:  -- the distance that it covers --
L:  In your immediate area, is there like -- like stores or little food stores, shops and things, or do you have to travel for everything?
R:  Well, okay.  The closest grocery store is about ... oh, almost a mile.
L:  Okay, that's not bad at all.
R:  Okay, so, um, we have that -- we have Vons[?], which is a derivative of Safeway[?] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- okay.  And then, ah, what we normally do, we usually go to Costco --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- you have that right?
L:  Yeah.  There's a Costco here.  It's -- they're out this way too.  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  We have quite a few of those, ah, in the immediate vicinity.  W- -- Our closest one is about, maybe, kind of like two, three miles --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- something like that.
L:  Mhm.  Right, what's about your, um -- what about yourself and your own family and everything that, ah, you know -- you'll, ah -- like obviously you grew up out there --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, ah, any -- any immediate relatives out there too now?  Or what's the --
R:  Well, the -- what relatives I do have that I know about [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you never know.
L:  Oh, I've got relatives I wish I didn't know about, so [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.  There you go.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  The one's I do have to claim --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- yeah, they're more or less here I guess.  Um, I think, ah, some of them have located, like we have these desert communities, like, ah, Palmdale --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- Lancaster --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which is about maybe, I feel like about fifty miles east.  No, I'm sorry, fifty miles west --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- something like that kind of thing.
L:  Yeah.  The San Fer- --
R:  But, ah, mostly, like for me, I mean I'm just living with my partner --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I have, ah, seven dogs and a cat --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- ah, no kids --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- per see, I mean no human kids --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just, ah, kids on four legs --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's okay, they're -- I'm sure they're better behaved than my two.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, you gotta have to be able to communicate with them, but once you sort of crack that code --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- then they know -- they know what the thing is.  And I -- I give 'em a routine --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- so they know exactly what they have to do and what not.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I don't usually have too many problems with dogs --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, I mean I don't -- I have always liked dogs anyway, so, um --
L:  Y- you say you have five -- five dogs, huh?
R:  No, seven.
L:  Oh, seven dogs.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Four Chihuahuas and three pit bulls.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Wow.  You know that's a --
R:  You know, what's that all about?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.  [LAUGH] I guess --
R:  Well, I started with the Chihuahuas and --
L:  I -- I just see the pit bulls, like, "Well, one day when Ray's out, we're having a feast".  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, "We need a salad, let's get a Chihuahua salad".  [LAUGH] 
L:  Ah, yeah, "We're going to have a cockt- -- Mexican salad".  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, the thing is, I keep 'em separated --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, but if you saw 'em together, you'd really crack up, because it's the Chihuahuas that are chasing the pit bulls.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  'Cause they are so grumpy, grouchy.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  God.  They can not get along with anybody, except themselves.  [LAUGH] 
L:  When I, yeah --
R:  But the pits, ah, I used to have like a doggie daycare, so two of 'em -- the two females, ah, they were always with me at the daycare --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so they encountered dogs all the time.  Shapes -- different shapes, sizes --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so they -- they know how to cope --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they're pretty social.
L:  Yeah.  No, I had a Chihuahua when I was little.  I think I was about five or six, but, ah -- but he ran off.  But, ah, they're -- they're nice little lap dogs because they're -- they -- they do like -- they do like company when they're -- when they're not too, ah -- too nervous or anything.
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
L:  But I -- I imag- --
R:  In fact, that's what they're doing right now.  In my [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  But, I imagine when somebody knocks at the door, it's a lot of yapping going on.
R:  Oh, god.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, yesterday they were on edge.  They thought they heard something --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and they have this death cry --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- they all work together.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  The leader starts, and then the rest of 'em get going, and they have all different pitches.  And it sounds -- I mean it's kind of blood curdling [LAUGH] when you hear that.
L:  Oh, god -- god bless ya, I couldn't handle that.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I just --
R:  Well, so do you guys have dogs out there?
L:  Yeah, ah, we --  no.  We, um -- [LIPSMACK] we had a couple of cats, ah, when we first moved -- we moved in this house about three years ago --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and, ah, I -- I -- I like animals, but I -- I actually am -- I have to say that I just find 'em a little difficult to keep up with, I'm not as dedicated --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you have to be dedicated to it and stuff.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  Yeah, we had a -- but we had a couple of cats, and, ah, one came down with a, ah -- it's my wife's cat.  They're actually my wife's cat, and one came down with like a tumor in it's, ah --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- under it's --
