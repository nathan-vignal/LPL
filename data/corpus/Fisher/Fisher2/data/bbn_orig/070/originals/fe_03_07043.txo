L:  Hi.  My name's Rosie.
R:  Hi.  My name's Rena.
L:  Rena?
R:  Yeah.
L:  We got a pretty heavy duty subject today didn't we? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Family.  Okay.  First of all, are you married?
R:  Yes.  Are you?
L:  Y- -- oh, yeah.  Married, a husband, six kids, [LAUGH] live out on a farm.  How about yourself?
R:  Six kids?
L:  Ah, yep.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I guess I really believe in family. [LAUGH] 
R:  Married, ah, no kids.  Ah --
L:  The -- oh, really?
R:  Mm.
L:  Okay.  Do you guys plan to have kids or ...?
R:  I g- -- I -- I got a couple of step kids but --
L:  Oh, do you?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Y- you've got a family then. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  You definitely have a family so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Okay.  Let me ask, I guess this is the -- the sixty four million dollar question, do you believe that a family is still a family whether they have two dads in the family or two moms in the family?  Or do you think a family is still mom and dad.
R:  Hm. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Heavy duty one isn't it?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Ah, I guess --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.  I guess it depends on the situation.
L:  True.  True.  We were foster parents for a while and -- and that question came up and c- -- and sparked a huge debate and I, myself -- we're -- we're Christian and I believe a family means mom, dad and kids, yes -- sometimes yes, sometimes no.  There's always a couple that can't have kids and stuff.  For that, I'm never gonna knock 'em saying, "Oh, you're not a family.  You don't have kids".
R:  Right.
L:  You know, it's because, ah -- I mean, my -- m- -- case in point, my kid sister, they spent ten years trying to have a baby -- just had one.  I considered them a family even before or if they elected not to have kids at all.  To me, they're still a family, you know?  'Cause it's their -- their u- -- they're two people living in un- unity and, um -- and s- -- and there for each other, you know?  So ...  And anyway, so what does family mean to you? [LAUGH]
R:  M- -- [NOISE] ah, well --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  About the -- yeah.  About the same living in --
L:  M- --
R:  -- having a kid[?] or anything but, ah --
L:  Right.
R:  You know, I d- -- I don't believe that you would, you know, le- -- ha- -- that you have to have the kids or anything --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to be one[?]. [LAUGH] --
L:  Okay.  So, how about then if you have a grandmother alone raising children?  Would you still classify that as a family?
R:  [SIGH] Huh. [NOISE] Grandmother raising alone?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hm ...
L:  It's a tough one isn't it? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, because I think our sympathies tend to go with the grandparent because you know there's a story behind there.  You know, where're the mom and dad that they're not able to take of 'em.  And you don't wanna knock the little old out and saying, you know, "Oh, you're not a family.  You don't have a mom and dad there".
R:  Yeah.  And I mean, so it's some- -- you know, I mean, if mom and dad have died or something --
L:  Yeah.  Mom and dad died or -- or unable to -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- unable to be there for the kids.  You know, then -- then --
R:  Then grandma -- yeah.
L:  -- then you qualify as a fam- --
R:  Yeah.  I would classify -- yeah.
L:  Yeah.  But then there's -- there's the single mom and she's, you know, chosen not to get married to the dad for whatever reason but yet has had a baby.  Does --
R:  I- --
L:  -- that qualify as a family?
R:  Mm.
L:  You know, it just -- it --
R:  Not really. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, see I know.  See then -- but -- but yet our sympathy can go with a grandmother but we -- our sympathy doesn't go with the mom [LAUGH] -- with the oth- -- with the single moms.  So --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, ah -- no.  I'm -- I'm -- we're traditional setting of mom, dad, kids.  But, um -- but there -- it's -- it's real tricky because you start to plan to people's feelings and me, automatically, I say, "Two gay guys with little kids, absolutely not".  But then what about the dad that the mom ran out on him and he's now raising the kid by himself?  And, you know -- so, ah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Does a family unit con- -- always consist of mom and dad or --
R:  A- --
L:  -- does it, you know?  I mean, or -- or do we -- do we allow, like, grandmothers then, you know, through their -- no fault of their own --
R:  Right.
L:  -- yeah, say the mom and dad -- I'm sure that's the case with some of the people from nine eleven.  You know?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That their mom and dad both died --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  Um, do you -- do you knock the grandmother or the aunts and uncle because they're raising the kids now?  They're not biologically theirs --
R:  No.
L:  -- but do you still qualify as --
R:  That's, kinda, like d- -- you know, I say it depends on the situation.  Like --
L:  Where w- -- if -- 
R:  Like --
L:  -- which way it goes?  You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So -- but anyway, it's very interesting [LAUGH] this, um --
R:  W- what do --
L:  Anyway --
R:  What do your kids age in range to?
L:  They range from -- well, I have a -- a one year old and then I have a eleven year old and then -- all the rest are in between. I have four girls and two boys.
R:  Four girls and two boys? [LAUGH]
L:  W- -- yeah.  It's -- it's a lotta work.  It's, you know, don't -- don't -- ah, just because I sound, ah -- ah, jumpy on the phone, you know, or whatever -- happy on the phone, it's -- it's definitely a lotta work.  But then, um, thank god --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for us the kids came one at a time, you know?  How many sets of twins or triplets [LAUGH] [several inaudible words].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That, I think, makes the family unit just, [LAUGH] really, spontaneously go faster, you know?  So --
R:  Well --
L:  But, ah --
R:  A- --
L:  Yeah.  So, what -- what ages are your step kids?
R:  Ah, twins for one. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, do you really?
R:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oopsy.
R:  But look --
L:  Mm.
R:  I, um -- all our step kids are of age and on their own, thank god.  So --
L:  Oh, are they.  Oh, good deal. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Good deal.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.  So, you're -- you're older then or -- or the kids are older anyway.
R:  Right.
L:  I- -- they're -- they're out f- -- off on their own.  Well, that's, kinda, nice.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And so, does it make it easier for you or not?
R:  Yes.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  And d- -- how long were you -- were you involved in the raising of them at all or ...?  When you got with your husband were they gone already?
R:  Um -- um, no.  Um, about thirteen years.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, so -- okay.  So, and then -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and so then, again, if you have a family, does it include the extended family?  You know, I mean, like I -- I actually have a daughter from a previous marriage. [MN] We were married for six weeks and then tried nine months to get rid of -- to get out it and [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, no.
L:  In the meantime, a little present came along, you know?  But, ah --
R:  Oh, no.
L:  But people, you know -- and she has a different last name and -- and then, of course, whenever you go someplace and you say "These are all these guys" and then, "This one's mine too but she has a different last name" then the people look at you, like, oh, you know, "W- what'd you do" or, "What happened to you?"  You know? [LAUGH] So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, ah -- oh, yeah.
R:  Certainly affects a kid too sometimes.
L:  What's that?
R:  It, kind of, affects the kid too sometimes.
L:  It does.  A- a- -- w- --
R:  When --
L:  Oh, absolutely.  Absolutely.
R:  Yeah.  When they're the only one --
L:  With a different last name.
R:  Right.
L:  Oh, absolutely.  Because they, um -- for instance, my kids were in school and the teacher wasn't, just, familiar with the family --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and she gave th- -- two of the kids treats but there's three of 'em in school but she didn't give Stephanie a treat because she had a different last name and she only saw two Sear[?] kids there so --
R:  Oh, no.
L:  -- she gave them the candies and not -- not my daughter and it -- it just -- you know, she -- she goes, "Mom, how can that be?" And [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, boy.
L:  So, you just have to, kind of, go with it as -- as you get along, you know?  Just -- just, kinda, pursue it and then just, a- -- um, m- -- as each bridge comes across it.  Y- -- just on your own, you know?  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But anyway, no it's definitely -- definitely interesting package there so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But -- but do you think you'll have any kids or not?
R:  No.  I can't.
L:  Oh, you can't?
R:  No.
L:  Oh, s- -- okay.  Well, I'm glad that [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm glad I said that first about [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, you've got -- not being able to have kids.  I mean, that -- just because somebody can't have kids, ah, to me, doesn't think that, oh -- on -- ah -- like, I said, for in case in point, my -- my kid sister, you know?  But what they were before -- a- and they were definitely still a family.  They were two -- still two people living together, united together, um, through that bond of marriage and, um ...  Okay.  How about a mom and a dad who never did get married?  Do you think they're --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a family?
R:  Ah, no.  Not really.
L:  Okay.  I -- I agree with you too there too.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I -- I -- because I think i- -- a- and everyone says, "Oh, it's just a piece of paper" you know?  Well, there's a lot that rides with that [LAUGH] piece of paper. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, yeah.  There is.  Yeah.
L:  There's a lot that goes with it, you know?  So, but, ah -- and so, therefore, I don't think that they should get the same rights as the family unit that's married should get.  And I know a lot of insurance companies are going back and forth now -- do we consider them family or not?  But I think that -- that to be married, to make that commitment to each other, earns you that right to be able to have those special privileges, you know?  Such as insurance.  Whereas if you're not a m- -- a married couple and you're just shacking up, then I -- I don't think you've earned that right there.
R:  Mm.
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Besides that they say the -- the statistics on that, those guys are separating are a -- much higher than the ones that are married.  You know?  So --
R:  Yeah.  I agree.  But, um --
L:  But h- -- so, how many years have you been married?
R:  Almost fourteen.
L:  Almost fourteen?  You got us beat. [LAUGH] We're -- we've been eleven years together so [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, ah -- lot of fun, I tell you.  No, no, no --
R:  What --
L:  -- ten years.  Excuse me.  Ten years.
R:  What state are you in?
L:  What -- um, Washington.
R:  Washington?
L:  Yeah.  Where -- where are you at?
R:  Florida.
L:  Oh, my goodness, you're the second person I talked to from Florida [LAUGH] from this thing.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Is this here -- this is your first one or not?
R:  No.
L:  Your third one?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, really?  Me too. [LAUGH]
R:  Is it?
L:  Me too.  So [LAUGH] --
R:  It's just --
L:  How'd you hear about it?
R:  Ah, RMC.
L:  Ah, same here.
R:  Really? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  What's your name?
R:  Reena.
L:  Reena?  Oh, [LAUGH] g- --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm Rosie in Washington State.  In fact, I was the one posting [LAUGH] -- that is so funny. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I guess we have, ah, Janette to thank for this one. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, goodness. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  One o- -- one of the other ones too was, um -- was, ah, RMC, ah, Barbara and stuff and we were -- we were just, gonna, ah -- since emails definitely got cut off and I was, like, "Ah". [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, man.  Well, just p- post and -- well, in fact, somebody did post on the [LAUGH] -- on the chitchat.  They said, you know, "We wanna finish the conversation.  Where's -- what's your number?  What's your [LAUGH] -- your thing ".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That is -- okay, so you're Renee over in Florida?
R:  Reena.
L:  Reena.  Okay.  R.E.N.A. or ...?
R:  Two e's.
L:  R.E. --
R:  Two e's.
L:  Okay.  R.E.N.E.?
R:  R.E.E.N.A.
L:  Oh.  R.E.E.N.A.  Okay.  Got it.  Okay.  Got it.  Okay.  Well, I'll have to watch for you then so [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No.  I was the one that posted on their for planet feedback and not to get into, um, that opinion site dot com or whatever it is.
R:  Oh.
L:  But, ah --
R:  Oh.  Okay.
L:  Major, major scam --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you know?  So, I'm glad I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Anyways -- okay.  Well, that's good.  I'm glad to [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Small world.  I tell ya.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  There's a lot of -- like, there's a lot of good things on there some- --
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you -- so, you weren't interested in the pull up war going on then were ya?
R:  Ah, no.
L:  Yeah.  No.  I -- I've got the little ones and I didn't know if I wanted to fight with that, you know?  So [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  This --
R:  I --
L:  As a --
R:  I must of missed that part though.
L:  Ah, they were from -- Walmart says there's three, um -- three packages for a, um --
R:  Ah --
L:  It was a fr- --
R:  I've seen that but what was the -- what was the debate ?
L:  Oh, the big fighting [SIGH] was because people, um -- they were trying to get things for free and Walmart didn't wanna let 'em and -- and again, there it goes back to the family union -- unit is if people are looking for free deals or good deals, that's gotta be because they've got a family and the money's tight and you've gotta make the most of your -- outta budget and if not, you know, I mean, what do you?  You know?  So --
