L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  Hi.
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  Good.  How are you?
L:  I'm good.  Ah, my name's Alvin.
R:  Okay, my name is --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You're Alvin?
L:  Yes.
R:  I'm Jamie.
L:  Jamie, nice to meet you.
R:  Good to meet you.  Where are you from?
L:  I'm calling from, ah, Rockdale, Maryland.
R:  Oh, wow.  I'm here in, um, Minneapolis, Minnesota.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Minneapolis, Minnesota.  Oh, my god.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Is this your, ah, first, ah, call for -- for this survey thing?  For this --
R:  Yeah, it is.
L:  Oh, it is?  Cool.
R:  Yeah.  Is it yours?
L:  This is my second one.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I got my first one yesterday, actually, and it was on, ah, education and the -- and technology, but --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it was pretty cool.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Okay.  Well, um, [LAUGH] would you -- do you want me to talk about my family, or do you want to talk about yours?
L:  Yeah.  How, um -- if you don't mind me asking, how old are you?
R:  Um, I'm twenty three.
L:  Oh, cool.  I'm twenty four.
R:  Oh, wow.  Is -- this is probably advertised in some kind of a college type newspaper thing then, huh?
L:  Yeah, def- -- well --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the guy I spoke with yesterday, I think he was in his fifties.  He was a farmer and had like three sons, so --
R:  Oh, wow.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- it was all weird.
R:  Well, I've got one --
L:  Go ahead.
R:  -- I've got one son on the way.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I'm due in August.
L:  Congratulations.
R:  Yeah.  It's pretty exciting --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- although [LAUGH] I'm getting to the point now where I'm, you know, kind of big and I'm tired and such, but --
L:  Oh, my god.  Congratulations.  Good for you.
R:  Well, thanks, yeah.  And I -- I am with the dad of course.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  So, yeah, I don't know --
L:  Are you guys married?
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  Are you married?
R:  No, um, we're gonna probably get married like in two thousand and four.
L:  Okay.  Very nice.
R:  But yeah, we just bought a house together.  I had my own house previously, but we wanted to -- well, I had a town house and we wanted to get a regular house -- single family.
L:  Okay.  Very nice.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Where did you meet him?  Was he a um, high school sweetheart, college --
R:  We actually met through Yahoo, a personal ad.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, and I -- I have quite a few friends that have met their significant others [LAUGH] that way also.  It's kind of the way to go I think nowadays, because --
L:  Yahoo.
R:  -- I know the bar thing just doesn't seem to work.
L:  Yeah, I -- I totally agree.  I -- is it free?  Is the service free, or --
R:  It's free to post your ad, but if you want to respond to them you can choose like, [LIPSMACK] I think one month is maybe like twenty dollars or something and it gets cheaper if you do a year long thing.  I -- he is the first guy I met believe it or not.  Then my friend she had to go on about like twenty dates before she [LAUGH] found the guy that she's been with --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- so, I guess it just kind of -- it's -- it's a little hit or miss, you know, but if you're honest in your ad and --
L:  Yeah, totally.  And you have your picture online with -- and he had his picture online too?
R:  Yeah.  I think that's the only way to go.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I absolutely agree.
R:  You know, you really want people to be able to see you, and you want to be able to see them.
L:  Got it.  So, how about your family?  What's your -- what's your family like and ...?
R:  [LAUGH] Sorry, none of my family are like what I would consider -- I mean, that's kind of an interesting topic because my family has changed in my opinion.  I would say my family is my boyfriend and my son, you know, and -- and then our kitties.  [LAUGH] We have two cats.  Um, and then now I -- I have to deal with his mom, you know, my mother in law.  His mom and dad are divorced.  I don't see his dad very much, but she's been living with a guy for like twelve years or something.  They just haven't decided to get married because he's got a psycho ex wife and they're able to -- he does like home improvements on her home and she's able to do everything in her name and so it doesn't look like he has any income and so his wi- ex wife can't come after him for money.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  It's kind of a good idea, I guess.  Um, so, I've got -- I've got her, and then I've got my family, which is my mom and my dad and my brother, and, I don't know, we have -- we get along okay, and, um, you know, at times it's good, at times it's hard, because I feel like they're really demanding on me, but --
L:  Were you born and raised in, ah, Minnesota?  Minneapolis?
R:  Yeah.  I've lived here all my life.
L:  Okay.  Cool.
R:  Um, yeah.  Go ahead and tell me about your family, I guess.
L:  Oh, I'm in the middle of, ah, three.  I have a older brother and younger sister.  Um, my parents are divorced actually.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I'm living with my dad right now.  I just graduated college like a year ago, and, ah --
R:  Oh, yeah, that's the same with me.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  Yeah.  Congratulations, ah --
L:  Thank you, thank you.  And, ah, my mom lives in Las Vegas actually, and, ah --
R:  Oh, that's a fun place to go and visit her.
L:  It's a very nice place.  I mean, I've been there a couple of times.  Ah, my brother and sisters, ah, they're both out with her in Las Vegas, and I've -- I've been there probably like three or four times and it's -- it's great, ah --
R:  I know.  I've been there once and I had a lot of fun.  I wasn't there long enough, though, I was only there for like a day, so I just kind of walked around and checked everything out.
L:  You were only there for a day?
R:  [LAUGH] It was -- I was on a, um, road trip with an old boyfriend and our destination was Yellowstone, but we got bored after a couple of days [LAUGH] so, we decided --
L:  Oh, my --
R:  -- to drive down to Vegas.  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, you -- you took a road trip from, ah, Minnesota all the way to Las Vegas and then Yellowstone and all the good stuff?
R:  Yeah.  It was -- it was pretty long.  I wouldn't probably of recommend doing it, or at least, I don't know, I mean this guy and I kind of argued quite a bit, so [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  I -- don't -- don't do it with somebody that you're not a hundred percent about, I guess, for sure.
L:  Yeah, totally.  Cool.
R:  Do you have any pets?
L:  Um, no actually.  I -- I want a dog.  I'm -- I'm a dog lover, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I just need some -- like I just need something to come home to, and right now I just can rely on a pet.  I mean I'm pretty sure you -- you know, you feel the same way towards your cats -- your two cats?
R:  Oh, I'm -- yeah, I'm crazy about them, except that the one -- the one guy, we're going to try and find a little girl for him, because he's not neutered yet, but he's kind of going crazy and he's --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- harassing the other guy who is neutered.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, no.  [LAUGH]
R:  So, [LAUGH] yeah, we a- -- and he's -- he's the most laid back cat, and we have a bunch of friends that would love to have little kittens, so --
L:  How cool.
R:  -- we're working -- we're working to get a little girl kitty for him and then after they would have a litter then we would both get them fixed.
L:  Get them both fixed, okay.  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah, but, and -- and then we want a dog too, but [LAUGH] we got the kid coming, so we got to wait, but we -- I don't know, we kind of want one of the medium sized dogs.  We don't want a huge big smelly dog, but we don't a little yipper either.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, you what -- are you -- did you already by a single family home, or are you -- are you -- are you still living in the townhouse?
R:  Um, we bought the house actually, like maybe a month ago or something we've been living there, but it was just like maybe two weeks ago that I finally sold my house and I'd actually close on it, um --
L:  My god.
R:  -- the eleventh of this month.
L:  That's pretty early.  I mean, you're -- you're pretty young and you've already bought your first -- you already had a house before.  Was it -- how did that work out, you ...?
R:  I had just owned it a year.  My parents gave me five thousand dollars as a graduation present for the down payment.
L:  Okay.  Oh, wow. 
R:  So --
L:  So, after graduation you moved into a new townhouse and then, oh wow, and you --
R:  Yeah, I just lived by myself, but it was pretty steep trying to make all the payments.  I probably should have had a roommate, but it's over now, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's -- it's definitely a testament to the fact that real estate's a good investment.  I made about -- well, part of it's the -- one of the real estate agents was -- is my mother in law, she's a real estate agent, so --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- she didn't take the normal, you know, two point five or three percent commission that she would take as a real estate agent --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- um, so that saved me a bit of money.  The other real estate agent did of course take his, but I ended up, you know, after al- -- h- his commission and everything like that, I ended up making about five thousand dollars on it in a year.
L:  Very nice.
R:  It was -- it was a decent investment.
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  But, I wouldn't recommend [LAUGH] my town home was like kind of a penthouse style, you had to walk up two flights of stairs and it's just -- it's probably a testament to how lazy people are.  A lot of people that saw the house were like, "All right.  I don't want a house that has, you know, two flights of stairs --"
L:  Two flights of stairs.
R:  -- to get up to it", and it was one level once you're up there, you know, but --"
L:  It must have been crazy moving all your furniture up and down though, and --
R:  Well, moving it in it had like -- we ha- -- it was still under construction, so we were able to go around the back and just go up one flight of stairs --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and moving out, I [LAUGH] -- my -- my boyfriend was awesome.  Him and his son came over one day up to my house while I was at work and they just pretty much took everything out of there.
L:  That is so cool.  Good for you.
R:  Yeah, he's -- he's definitely, I mean, I've been lucky to find him, 'cause I -- I'm sure, you know, obviously it sounds like you're kind of, you know, in the know about the dating world, you know, but him and I haven't been together like a super long time, it's gonna be a year in July, and so obviously we didn't plan the pregnancy or anything, but we both love kids and stuff like that --
L:  That is so awesome.
R:  -- and we're excited for it, but, um, yeah, I don't know, he's -- it's just -- it's definitely hard to find somebody that you're -- that you get along with and stuff and that's your best friend, and -- but -- but that's a good definition of family too I suppose.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  I mean, how you want your family to be.  People you get along with.
L:  Mhm.  And that's [inaudible].  I am -- you know what, that's the second pers- -- you're the second person that tal- talked about Yahoo today --
R:  Really?
L:  -- about the personal ads, and it's -- I think it's a sign --
R:  It's a sign.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] It really is.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That is so cool.  I'm so happy for you.  I mean, you have -- you have a baby coming and then you're getting married, and you -- you already set.  I mean, what did you study in college?
R:  Um, I was an English major.
L:  You're an English -- are you doing anything with English now?
R:  Ah, kind of.  I work at, um, a non profit organization that I interned for, um, while I was still in school; it was required of me, but then it -- it ended up turning into a job --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- and it's -- it's a really --
