AND I'M SINGLE AND THIRTY EIGHT AND UM NONE OF US SUPPORT EACH OTHER [LAUGHTER] AND UM  (fe_03_07080-A-0016)
NOT THAT I WOULDN'T WANT TO I MEAN I LOVE MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS BUT BECAUSE I DON'T SUPPORT WHAT MY  (fe_03_07080-A-0017)
PARENTS DID UM THEY WON'T TALK TO ME AND UM MY PARENTS WERE VERY VERY ABUSIVE AND THERE WASN'T REALLY A FAMILY UNIT EVERYTHING WAS ALL FOR PUBLIC AND FOR SHOW  (fe_03_07080-A-0018)
BUT THAT'S MADE ME APPRECIATE OTHER PEOPLE THAT HAVE FAMILIES AND ME WANTING A FAMILY AND I'VE DEVELOPED  (fe_03_07080-A-0019)
MY OWN FAMILY LIKE F- THROUGH FRIENDS  (fe_03_07080-A-0020)

BIOLOGICAL SO  (fe_03_07080-A-0027)
I HAD THE OPPOSITE EXPERIENCE  (fe_03_07080-A-0028)
IN A BIOLOGICAL WAY BUT I H- HAVE THE SAME  (fe_03_07080-A-0029)
PHILOSOPHY ABOUT FAMILY  (fe_03_07080-A-0030)
BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT IT SHOULD'VE BEEN THAT WAY  (fe_03_07080-A-0031)
BIOLOGICALLY  (fe_03_07080-A-0032)
AND I AND I REALLY THINK THAT  (fe_03_07080-A-0033)
FAMILIES SHOULD REALLY DO THE BEST THEY CAN TO WORK WITH WORK OUT THEIR PROBLEMS BUT IF THEY CAN'T THEN I BELIEVE THAT INDIVIDUALS SHOULD  (fe_03_07080-A-0034)
TRY TO BUILD A FAMILY OF THEIR OWN IN SOME WAY  (fe_03_07080-A-0035)
BECAUSE WHEN I DIDN'T HAVE LIKE THE SURROGATE FAMILY THAT I HAVE NOW  (fe_03_07080-A-0036)

IT WASN'T THE SAME BECAUSE FAMILIES ARE SO IMPORTANT  (fe_03_07080-A-0038)
AND LISTENING TO PEOPLE TALK ABOUT HAVING A FAMILY AND THE THINGS THAT THEY DID IT JUST MADE ME FEEL LIKE AN OUTSIDER AND IT YOU KNOW NOTH- AH I DIDN'T I DIDN'T REALLY BELONG TO ANYTHING  (fe_03_07080-A-0039)
AND THIS GIVES ME A FOUNDATION AND A SENSE OF BELONGING AND AND PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY THAT YOU C- YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T REALLY MAKE UP FOR WHAT YOU DIDN'T HAVE BUT  (fe_03_07080-A-0040)

UM  (fe_03_07080-A-0043)

YOU KNOW YOU GOT TO BE ABLE TO GIVE TO PEOPLE AND HAVE THAT CLOSENESS [NOISE]  (fe_03_07080-A-0045)
AND TO SET EXAMPLES FOR THE OTHER PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE EVEN IF YOU'RE SINGLE YOU KNOW IF YOUR BROTHERS OR ANYONE HAS CHILDREN THEN YOU CAN BE SETTING EXAMPLES AT SOME POINT  (fe_03_07080-A-0046)
EVEN FOR THEM FOR YOUR NIECES OR NEPHEWS OR  (fe_03_07080-A-0047)
