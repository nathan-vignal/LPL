LIKE [SIGH] INCORPORATE YOU KNOW LIKE THE SENSE OF SMELL AND THE SENSE SENSE OF TOUCH AND SENSE OF TASTE BUT BE ABLE TO SEE THINGS AND HEAR THINGS AND EVERYTHING AT THE SAME TIME RATHER THAN LIKE LOOKING AT A BOOK WITH A ONE WITH LIKE YOU KNOW A STILL PICTURE  (fe_03_07001-B-0036)
LIKE IT REALLY DOES  (fe_03_07001-B-0037)
LIKE AH INSTEAD OF JUST READING A MARTIN LUTHER SPEECH NOW YOU CAN FIND A RECORDING  (fe_03_07001-B-0038)
OR INSTEAD OF LIKE LOOKING OF A PHOTO OF A BIRD TRYING TO MEMORIZE YOU KNOW IT'S MATING HABITS OR SOMETHING FOR A BIOLOGY CLASS THERE'S SO MUCH MORE LIKE  (fe_03_07001-B-0039)

AH I WAS SPEAKING TO ONE OF MY FRIENDS WHO IS IS A PROFESSOR AT AH THE HIGH SCHOOL I GRADUATED FROM  (fe_03_07001-B-0047)
AND SHE SAID THE PROBLEM IS  (fe_03_07001-B-0048)
IS THAT NOW THAT THE INTERNET IS SO VERY READILY AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS SHOULD  (fe_03_07001-B-0049)
YOU KNOW IT'S TOO TEMPTING FOR PEOPLE TO PLAGIARIZE AND THEN THERE'S SO MANY STUDENTS AND SO MANY PAPERS THAT IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO YOU KNOW  (fe_03_07001-B-0050)
LIKE THIS TO CHECK EVERY SINGLE PAPER TO SEE IF IT'S PLAGIARIZED  (fe_03_07001-B-0051)
AND SO LIKE WHAT IT DOES IS IT PROVIDES SO MUCH OF A TEMPTATION AND SO MUCH MORE ACCESS  (fe_03_07001-B-0052)

TURNING IN WRITING THAT ISN'T THEIR OWN OR IDEAS THAT AREN'T THEIR OWN  (fe_03_07001-B-0054)

BECAUSE COMPUTERS ARE SOMETHING THAT LIKE OLDER PEOPLE USE AND YOU KNOW YOUNGER KIDS ARE LIKE JUST ALWAYS INTERESTED IN LIKE USING SOMETHING THAT ADULTS USE 'CAUSE IT'S LIKE A BIG PEOPLE'S THING  (fe_03_07001-B-0063)

YOU KNOW HE'S REALLY EXCITED ABOUT IT AND HE LIKE ASSOCIATES THAT LEARNING WITH WITH COMPUTERS  (fe_03_07001-B-0076)
AND HE'S VERY EXCITED TO USE COMPUTERS BECAUSE HE LIKE HE'S PROUD OF THE FACT THAT HE COULD RECOGNIZE THAT AND HE COULD TELL SOMEBODY THAT AND IT'S A FEATHER IN HIS CAP AND HE ASSOCIATES THAT WITH THE COMPUTER AND THE COMPUTER HELPED HIM TO DO THIS THING THAT HE'S SO PROUD OF  (fe_03_07001-B-0077)

MUCH MORE ACCESSIBLE  (fe_03_07001-B-0091)
