DO YOU BELIEVE THAT A FAMILY IS STILL A FAMILY WHETHER THEY HAVE TWO DADS IN THE FAMILY OR TWO MOMS IN THE FAMILY  (fe_03_07043-A-0007)

WE'RE WE'RE CHRISTIAN AND I BELIEVE A FAMILY MEANS MOM DAD AND KIDS YES SOMETIMES YES SOMETIMES NO THERE'S ALWAYS A COUPLE THAT CAN'T HAVE KIDS AND STUFF FOR THAT I'M NEVER GONNA KNOCK 'EM SAYING OH YOU'RE NOT A FAMILY YOU DON'T HAVE KIDS YOU KNOW IT'S BECAUSE AH I  (fe_03_07043-A-0012)
