PARENTS AND THE SCHOOL SYSTEM NOW THAT'S REALLY CAUSING A A COMPLETE BREAKDOWN I THINK  (fe_03_07033-A-0055)

THE LACK OF DISCIPLINE  (fe_03_07033-A-0062)
UM IN LAW ENFORCEMENT  (fe_03_07033-A-0063)
AND THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM YOU KNOW THEY'RE  (fe_03_07033-A-0064)
PEOPLE DON'T HAVE CONSEQUENCES FOR ANYTHING YOU KNOW THEY GET A LITTLE SLAP ON THE WRIST  (fe_03_07033-A-0065)

HI AH I'M NADINE  (fe_03_07033-B-0002)
UM  (fe_03_07033-B-0003)
I GUESS WHAT FAMILY MEANS FOR ME IS  (fe_03_07033-B-0004)
UM  (fe_03_07033-B-0005)
A GROUP OR PERSON WHERE YOU CAN BE YOURSELF AND YOU'RE ALWAYS GONNA HAVE SUPPORTED TO LIKE A SUPPORT UNIT  (fe_03_07033-B-0006)
AND  (fe_03_07033-B-0007)
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT  (fe_03_07033-B-0008)
YEAH  (fe_03_07033-B-0009)
EXACTLY AH AND ALSO UM  (fe_03_07033-B-0010)
IT'S THE ONLY PLACE TO L- LIKE UM FOR A CHILD IT'S THE ONLY PLACE THAT THEY HAVE OTHER THAN SCHOOL WHERE  (fe_03_07033-B-0011)
IT'S IT'S LIKE THEIR SHELTER IT'S THEIR PLACE WHERE THEY GET TO  (fe_03_07033-B-0012)
TO GROW AND BECOME A BETTER PERSON AND I THINK THE ROLE MODELS SHOULD BE WITHIN  (fe_03_07033-B-0013)
AH THE FAMILY AS WELL AND THAT'S A BIG VERY IMPORTANT PART IN ANYONE'S LIFE YOUNG OR OLD  (fe_03_07033-B-0014)
YEAH  (fe_03_07033-B-0015)
MHM  (fe_03_07033-B-0016)
WOW  (fe_03_07033-B-0017)
TRUE I TRY TO SPEND A LOTTA TIME WITH MY FAMILY AS WELL  (fe_03_07033-B-0018)
UM  (fe_03_07033-B-0019)
WE'RE NOT REALLY CLOSE I WOULD SAY WE'RE ALL THE KIDS ARE CLOSER TO MOM  (fe_03_07033-B-0020)
AND UM IT'S DIFFERENT BOTH OF MY PARENTS WORKED HOWEVER MY MY DAD HAD A HOME OFFICE WHERE HE WORKED SO IT IT WASN'T AS IF THEY WERE FAR AWAY  (fe_03_07033-B-0021)
BUT UM  (fe_03_07033-B-0022)
I THINK IT DID INFLUENCE THE WAY THAT I AM  (fe_03_07033-B-0023)
I STILL WANNA WORK BUT I STILL WANNA BE AT HOME AS WELL WHEN I HAVE MY OWN FAMILY  (fe_03_07033-B-0024)
UM  (fe_03_07033-B-0025)
TRUE  (fe_03_07033-B-0026)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_07033-B-0027)
YEAH  (fe_03_07033-B-0028)
AND I THINK ALSO THE ENVIRONMENT WHERE YOU LIVE IS GONNA INFLUENCE HOW YOUR FAMILY'S GONNA BEHAVE LIKE I COME FROM A SMALL TOWN OUR FAMILY LIVES IN A SMALL TOWN  (fe_03_07033-B-0029)
SO FOR US IT WAS LESS DISTRACTION LESS THINGS TO DO WHICH FORCED US TO BE TO SPEND MORE TIME TOGETHER AND ALSO IN MY HOME TOWN  (fe_03_07033-B-0030)
EVEN TODAY UM STORES ALL THE STORES ARE CLOSED ON SUNDAY SO IT'S SUNDAY IS STILL FAMILY DAY IN MY HOME TOWN BUT WHERE I'M LIVING RIGHT NOW IT'S TOTALLY DIFFERENT SO FAMILIES HERE IN MY CITIES ARE NOT AS TOGETHER  (fe_03_07033-B-0031)
AS  (fe_03_07033-B-0032)
IN SMALLER AREAS I WOULD SAY  (fe_03_07033-B-0033)
BUT I THINK ALSO ONE THING THAT IS IMPORTANT THAT PARENTS PROBABLY DON'T REALIZE IS HOW  (fe_03_07033-B-0035)
THEIR BEHAVIOR INFLUENCES THEIR CHILDREN  (fe_03_07033-B-0036)
UM ESPECIALLY CHILDREN WHEN THEY BECOME DETRI- WELL WHEN THEY BECOME TEENAGERS AND YOUNG ADULTS ALL OF THE RELATIONSHIP UM MODELS THAT THEY SEE IS IS THEIR PARENTS SO  (fe_03_07033-B-0037)
IF THE PARENTS ARE SENDING MIXED SIGNALS WELL THE KID IS GONNA BE CONFUSED LATER ON  (fe_03_07033-B-0038)
AND AH I'VE SEEN AH WITHIN MINE MY MY SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT PEOPLE THAT I KNOW WHOSE PARENTS SPLIT UP BECAUSE OF AH  (fe_03_07033-B-0039)
EITHER THEY WEREN'T TOGETHER OR DISHONEST WITH ONE ANOTHER  (fe_03_07033-B-0040)
UM IT DID TRULY HURT THE KIDS EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE WITHIN THEIR TWENTIES BECAUSE IT PUTS EVERYTHING BACK IN QUESTION ALL THE VALUES ALL EVERYTHING RELATIONSHIP WISE LIKE DO YOU HAVE TO RETHINK OR RE-FIGURE OUT EVERYTHING  (fe_03_07033-B-0041)
MHM  (fe_03_07033-B-0042)
YES  (fe_03_07033-B-0043)
MHM  (fe_03_07033-B-0044)
OH MY GOD  (fe_03_07033-B-0045)
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S WORSE IS PROBABLY THE THE CHILD LATER ON  (fe_03_07033-B-0046)
IS GOING TO END UP MARRYING SOMEONE THAT DOES THE SAME THAT HAS THE SAME BEHAVIOR I'VE SEEN IT WITHIN MY WORK AREA WHERE THE SON IN LAW WORKS WITH THE FATHER  (fe_03_07033-B-0047)
THE FATHER IN LAW AND UM  (fe_03_07033-B-0048)
THEY DON'T GET ALONG AND IT GETS TO THE POINT WHERE HE IS VERY VULGAR TOWARDS HIS FATHER IN LAW  (fe_03_07033-B-0049)
AND HE'S MARRIED TO HIS HIS DAUGHTER AND I THINK THE FATHER MUST HAVE SPOKEN THE SAME WAY WITHIN THE HOUSEHOLD FOR THE DAUGHTER TO GO AND PICK UP SOMEONE WITH THE SAME VOCABULARY AND IF THE VOCABULARY WAS YOU KNOW  (fe_03_07033-B-0050)
MORE CLEAN WITHIN THE HOUSEHOLD THERE'S NO WAY THE DAUGHTER WOULD'VE BEEN WITH SOMEONE LIKE THAT  (fe_03_07033-B-0051)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_07033-B-0052)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_07033-B-0053)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_07033-B-0054)
YES  (fe_03_07033-B-0055)
EXACTLY THAT'S THE SAME WAY  (fe_03_07033-B-0056)
WITH THE PEOPLE I WORK I MEAN THE FATHER IN LAW MY BOSS AND HIS SON IN LAW ARE JUST LIKE  (fe_03_07033-B-0057)
OH MY GOD HE HE HIS SON IN LAW HE'S GONNA SLAM THE DOORS HE'S GONNA CURSE  (fe_03_07033-B-0058)
AND EVEN WHEN HE SEES HIS MOTHER IN LAW JUST FOR A SMALL TALK HE CANNOT SAY A SENTENCE WITHOUT SAYING THE F WORD  (fe_03_07033-B-0059)
AND FOR ME I AM REALLY SHOCKED I MEAN EVEN IF THAT WAS MY HUSBAND A- TALKING TO MY DAD OR MY MOM LIKE THAT I WOULDN'T BE HAPPY AT ALL  (fe_03_07033-B-0060)
OR MAYBE A LACK OF OF VOCABULARY COULD IT BE  (fe_03_07033-B-0061)
YEAH THE SAME WITH ME I MEAN M- MY NATIVE LANGUAGE IS FRENCH AND EVEN FOR COMING FROM A FRENCH FAMILY WE DO NOT  (fe_03_07033-B-0062)
USE PROFANITY AH HOWEVER IT'S VERY POPULAR WITHIN THE QUEBEC AREA BUT UM W- WE DON'T BUT I I I I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT BEFORE ACTUALLY  (fe_03_07033-B-0063)
TRUE  (fe_03_07033-B-0064)
THAT IS TRUE  (fe_03_07033-B-0065)
THE SAME WITH AH  (fe_03_07033-B-0066)
THAT I SEE IN MY AREA FAMILIES ARE BEING LESS STRICT I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE SCARED OR THEY THINK THEY'RE THEY'RE MORE LIBERAL BUT IT IT IT IT MODIFIES COMPLETELY THE BEHAVIOR OF THE CHILDREN THAT I SEE  (fe_03_07033-B-0067)
AH EVEN WITH THE SCHOOL SYSTEM THEY W- IN MY AREA THEY WANT THE SCHOOL SYSTEM TO BE EVEN EASIER WHICH IS ACTUALLY GONNA HURT THE KIDS AND ON THE AND ON THE OTHER HAND THE DISCIPLINE IN  (fe_03_07033-B-0068)
THE FAMILY STRUCTURES WITHIN MY AREA ARE ALWAYS AH FALLING APART SO  (fe_03_07033-B-0069)
YEAH  (fe_03_07033-B-0070)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_07033-B-0071)
