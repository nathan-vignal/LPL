THAT  (fe_03_07096-A-0050)
ARE NOT FOLLOWING PRACTICES THEN IT'S JUST IT'S GOING TO AFFECT THE WHOLE MARKET THERE'S GONNA BE THE TRUST IS NOT GOING TO BE THERE AND THE CONFIDENCE AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS  (fe_03_07096-A-0051)

IDEAS ABOUT WHAT THE GOVERNMENT COULD DO  (fe_03_07096-A-0059)
TO  (fe_03_07096-A-0060)
BE MORE INVOLVED OR WOULD THAT BASICALLY BE THE IDEA OF CREATING THE AGENCY OR A SPECIFIC  (fe_03_07096-A-0061)
GROUP  (fe_03_07096-A-0062)
MHM  (fe_03_07096-A-0063)

UM  (fe_03_07096-A-0067)
IF WATCH OVER  (fe_03_07096-A-0068)
CORPORATE AMERICA WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA  (fe_03_07096-A-0069)
JUST LIKE YOU SAID I HAVE LIKE THE F._C._C. YOU KNOW THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION AND THERE'S A LOTTA FEDERAL REGULATION IN OTHER INDUSTRIES BUT UM APPARENTLY DOESN'T INCORPORATE THE WAY IT SHOULD INTO  (fe_03_07096-A-0070)
