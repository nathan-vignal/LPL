AH PARENTS WHO ARE STILL MARRIED HAVE FRIENDS WH- WITH PARENTS THAT ARE STILL MARRIED SO MAYBE IT'S NOT SO MUCH GEOGRAPHICAL DIFFERENCES BUT THE A DIFFERENT IN THE SUBSET OF THE POPULATION WHO I HANG OUT WITH NOW AS OPPOSED TO WHEN I WAS GROWING UP THAT MAKES ME THINK CHANGES IN FAMILY ARE DIFFERENT BASED ON GEOGRAPHICAL DIFFERENCES  (fe_03_07024-A-0054)
YEAH DEFINITELY BECAUSE IF THERE WASN'T SO MANY PEOP- IF THERE WEREN'T SO MANY OPTIONS AVAILABLE SOME PEOPLE WOULD JUST BE LEFT OUT THEY WOULDN'T HAVE ANY OPTIONS AT ALL  (fe_03_07024-A-0056)

IS NOT SO MUCH AN A- LIKE EMOTIONALLY I HAVE THE RIGHT FOR EVERYONE TO RESPECT MY RELATIONSHIP AND SEE THAT IT'S SANCTIFIED AH TO THAT THERE I'D THEY DESERVE THE SAME SORT OF BENEFITS AS A NORMAL NUCLEAR FAMILY WOULD OR A NORMAL MARRIED FAMILY  (fe_03_07024-A-0060)
OH OKAY SORRY  (fe_03_07024-A-0061)
TO ME I THINK THE BIGGEST REASON FOR GAY MARRIAGES TO BE LEGALIZED IS SO THAT PEOPLE IN THOSE SORTS OF RELATIONSHIPS CAN HAVE THE SAME HEALTH INSURANCE SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS THAT PEOPLE IN OTHER  (fe_03_07024-A-0062)
UM HETEROSEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS HAVE ALTHOUGH I CAN SEE HOW IF I WAS GAY OR A LESBIAN I WOULD  (fe_03_07024-A-0063)
LIKELY SEE IT FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE  (fe_03_07024-A-0064)
BUT TO ME  (fe_03_07024-A-0065)
I DON'T KNOW  (fe_03_07024-A-0066)
MARRIAGE TO ME ISN'T REALLY A HUGE DEAL  (fe_03_07024-A-0067)
AND I THINK THAT IF YOU'RE IN A LONG TERM LOVING RELATIONSHIP IT'S NOT REALLY THAT MUCH DIFFERENT I ACTUALLY GOT INTO A HUGE ARGUMENT WITH MY MOTHER 'CAUSE I LIVE WITH MY BOYFRIEND AND SHE THINKS IT'S SIN AND I'M LIKE WELL IT'S NOT REALLY ANY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU DO WE [LAUGHTER] CARE ABOUT EACH OTHER THE SAME WAY THAT YOU THAT YOU CARE ABOUT MY DAD  (fe_03_07024-A-0068)
