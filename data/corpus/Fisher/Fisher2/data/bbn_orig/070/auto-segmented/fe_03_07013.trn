I'M SUSAN  (fe_03_07013-A-0003)
RIGHT ON COMPUTERS I HEARD THAT  (fe_03_07013-A-0005)
ABSOLUTELY ENHANCE  (fe_03_07013-A-0006)
YEAH WELL THAT DEPENDS I MEAN I KNOW I MAKE MY KIDS DO IT THE LONG WAY THEY NEED TO KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT THEY'RE DOING  (fe_03_07013-A-0007)
BUT I THINK HAVING COMPUTERS IS HAS REALLY MADE A DIFFERENCE MY SON'S IN FOURTH GRADE AND JUST DID A POWERPOINT PRESENTATION 'CAUSE OF SOMETHING HE LEARNED IN SCHOOL  (fe_03_07013-A-0008)
WHICH I THINK IS EXCELLENT  (fe_03_07013-A-0009)
NO BUT HE DID HE USED HE USED THE PRESENTATION TO ADD TO HIS PRESENTATION  (fe_03_07013-A-0010)
HE HAD TO SPEAK WHAT HE WAS DOING HE HAD TO KNOW THE INFORMATION HE HAD TO KNOW IT BEFORE HE COULD MAKE THE PRESENTATION BEFORE HE COULD EVEN MAKE THE POWERPOINT  (fe_03_07013-A-0011)
SO I MEAN I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT I THINK IT DEFINITELY ENHANCES WHAT THEY'RE DOING  (fe_03_07013-A-0012)
OH I AGREE WITH YOU THERE  (fe_03_07013-A-0013)
I AGREE WITH THAT BUT I YOU KNOW I TOLD MY KIDS MORE RESPONSIBLE I I MEAN IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ME THAT THEY KNOW HOW TO DO THESE THINGS SO  (fe_03_07013-A-0014)

AS LONG AS THEY LEARN YOU KNOW AH READING WRITING AND ARITHMETIC  (fe_03_07013-B-0049)
BEING COMPUTER LITERATE IS  (fe_03_07013-B-0050)
DO THEY HAVE A COMPUTER AT HOME  (fe_03_07013-B-0052)

IN A WAY  (fe_03_07013-B-0067)
IN A WAY HAVING A TEACHER YOU KNOW FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO DO THEIR WORK AT HOME AND HAVE A SOMEONE WHO'S A QUALIFIED TEACHER GRADE THEIR WORK  (fe_03_07013-B-0068)
I THINK IS A PLUS  (fe_03_07013-B-0069)
LIKE IF THEY WRITE AN ESSAY YOU KNOW THEY WRITE A  (fe_03_07013-B-0070)
THEY WRITE AN ESSAY AND THEY SEND IT OVER THEY'D SEND YOU KNOW OVER THE INTERNET  (fe_03_07013-B-0071)
A- AND THEN THE TEACHER WILL GRADE IT  (fe_03_07013-B-0072)
THEY'LL LIKE AN ENGLISH TEACHER  (fe_03_07013-B-0073)
A REAL ENGLISH TEACHER WOULD GRADE IT YOU KNOW AND GIVE HER RECOMMENDATIONS AND STUFF AND THEN SEND IT BACK TO THE HOME  (fe_03_07013-B-0074)

I MEAN  (fe_03_07013-B-0076)
I WOULD THINK THAT THEY WOULD UM AH  (fe_03_07013-B-0077)
