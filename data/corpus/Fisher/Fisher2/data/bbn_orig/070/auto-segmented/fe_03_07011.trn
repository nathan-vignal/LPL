HELLO MY NAME IS R- ROCHELLE KENNEDY  (fe_03_07011-B-0001)
FINE I BELIEVE THAT COMPUTERS IN EDUCATION ARE VERY BENEFICIAL BECAUSE CURRENTLY I WORK AS A SUBSTITUTE TEACHER AND COMPUTERS ARE PLAYING A VITAL ROLE AS FAR AS TECHNOLOGY AND BRINGING  (fe_03_07011-B-0002)
THE STUDENT UP TO THE FOREFRONT OF BEING ABLE TO BE COMPETITIVE IN THE JOB FORCE  (fe_03_07011-B-0003)
AND WHEN THEY DO LEAVE THE SCHOOL SETTING THEY NOT ONLY HAVE A TRADE BUT THEY ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE AH AT THE FOREFRONT AND BASICALLY ACHIEVING THEIR GOALS  (fe_03_07011-B-0004)
AND ALSO IT IT'S VITAL AS FAR AS  (fe_03_07011-B-0005)
IN COLLEGES THAT THEY'RE SEEKING APPLICATIONS AND BECAUSE MOST OF THE COLLEGES ARE RUN BY IF THEY GIVE PRESENTATIONS THEY HAVE TO HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE OF POWERPOINT OR MICROSOFT OFFICE SOFTWARE  (fe_03_07011-B-0006)
SO IT AC- ACTUALLY TO ME IT'S BENEFICIAL  (fe_03_07011-B-0007)
WELL AND ACTUALLY I WOULD E- I'M A CREATIVE PERSON AND AS FAR AS TECHNOLOGY  (fe_03_07011-B-0008)
IT HAS INCREASED MY CURIOSITY TO LEARN MORE AND TO ACTUALLY FIND OUT THE IN DEPTH OF THINGS BECAUSE AS FAR AS THE COMPUTER ITSELF IS SO SYSTEMATIC  (fe_03_07011-B-0009)
THAT IF THE STUDENT STARTS LEARNING ABOUT IT WHETHER IT'S IN PROGRAMMING OR WHETHER IT'S JUST IN WORD PROCESSING  (fe_03_07011-B-0010)
IT'S GIVING THEM A DISCIPLINE  (fe_03_07011-B-0011)
AS FAR AS A STRUCTURE BECAUSE IN ORDER FOR YOU TO LEARN THE COMPUTER APPLICATIONS OR THE COMPUTER SYSTEM ITSELF IT TAKES YOU THROUGH STEPS IN ORDER FOR YOU TO LEARN IT SO IT REALLY DOESN'T  (fe_03_07011-B-0012)
D- DEPENDING ON THE STUDENT THEY COULD POSSIBLY GIVE EVIDENCE TO WHERE THEY W- WANT TO LEARN MORE  (fe_03_07011-B-0013)
AND IN ACTUALITY ON A COMPUTER MOST TEACHERS ARE EDUCATORS AS I STATED UM  (fe_03_07011-B-0014)
SOMEWHAT IN THE SCHOOL SETTING  (fe_03_07011-B-0015)
R- REALLY ENCOURAGE THEM TO BE  (fe_03_07011-B-0016)
WITH DIFFERENT PROJECTS THAT BRING IN THE CREATIVITY BUT ALL THEY DO IS  (fe_03_07011-B-0017)
THEY APPLY IT AND THEY USE THE CREATIVITY IN PROJECTS AND THEY ENHANCE IT BY PUTTING IT ON THE SYSTEM AND BASICALLY WORKING WITH IT AND MANEUVERING WITH IT SO  (fe_03_07011-B-0018)
WELL IN THAT CASE THERE'S SO MANY PROGRAMS OUT THERE WHERE THE PARENTS CAN ACTUALLY  (fe_03_07011-B-0020)
BASICALLY MONITOR WHAT THEIR ST- AH CHILDREN ARE DOING AFTER SCHOOL BUT IN THE SCHOOL SETTING THERE ARE GUIDELINES THAT THE STUDENTS HAVE TO USE AND ACTUALLY THEY HAVE TO TH- SIGN  (fe_03_07011-B-0021)
A AFFIDAVIT THAT THEY'RE GONNA COMPLY WITH IT BEFORE THEY EVEN GO TO THE COMPUTER LABS AND THEY KNOW THIS SO THERE'S NOT TOO MUCH MISUSE IN THE SCHOOL SETTING  (fe_03_07011-B-0022)
AND AT HOME THERE ARE SO MANY MECHANISMS THAT ARE IN THE CIRCLE AROUND THAT THE PARENTS CAN USE TO IF THEY DO WANNA RESTRICT THEM IN THAT AREA THEY CAN  (fe_03_07011-B-0023)
WELL  (fe_03_07011-B-0024)
I BELIEVE WELL WHEN I WAS AT WORKING AT A UNIVERSITY THERE ARE ALL TYPES OF SOFTWARE THERE ARE ACADEMIC BASED SOFTWARE LIKE THERE'S  (fe_03_07011-B-0025)
SOFTWARE PACKAGES THAT YOU CAN LOAD ON TO YOUR COMPUTER THAT ACTUALLY TEACHES YOU CALCULUS OR TEACHES YOU ABOUT TRIGONOMETRY AND IT GIVES YOU THAT ADDITIONAL EDGE AND LIKE I SAY  (fe_03_07011-B-0026)
THERE'S A LOTTA EDUCATIONAL PACKETS IF YOU HAVE A PRESCHOOLER THERE'S READER RABBIT PROGRAMS OR MATHS PROGRAMS THAT YOU CAN LOAD  (fe_03_07011-B-0027)
AND THERE'S  (fe_03_07011-B-0028)
SOFTWARE PACKAGES YOU CAN LOAD ON YOUR COMPUTER AND THEY CAN LEARN THE COMPUTER AT A EARLY AGE AND LIKE THE READER RABBIT PROGRAM IT IT'S SOMETHING FUN FOR THEM BUT IT'S AT THE SAME TIME THEY'RE LEARNING  (fe_03_07011-B-0029)
WOW I'M DOING THIS  (fe_03_07011-B-0030)
I'M LOOKING AT SOMETHING THAT'S FUN BUT IT'S JUST ON A COMPUTER SO IT'S NOT TAKING AWAY FROM THEIR KNOWLEDGE IT'S GIVING THEM SOMETHING  (fe_03_07011-B-0031)
TO  (fe_03_07011-B-0032)
ACTUALLY LIKE I SAID IN THE BEGINNING I BELIEVE IT'S ENHANCING THEM TO WHERE THEY KNOW THIS IS WHERE THE FUTURE IS HEADED IN ORDER FOR YOU TO PROGRESS YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO KNOW SOMETHING  (fe_03_07011-B-0033)
REGARDING THE COMPUTER BECAUSE MO- MOST OF THE JOBS THAT YOU'RE GONNA FIND EVEN AT THE SUPERMARKETS EVEN AT A RESTAURANT THEY'RE BRINGING IN COMPUTERS EVEN THOUGH IT'S LIKE A CASH REGISTER SETTING  (fe_03_07011-B-0034)
AND THEY THEY'RE USED TO SCAN GROCERIES AND EVEN YOU CAN CHECK OUT YOURSELF BUT YOU GOT TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT  (fe_03_07011-B-0035)
READING THE INSTRUCTIONS AND THAT'S WHAT THE COMPUTER IS ABOUT YOU HAVE TO KNOW THE INSTRUCTIONS  (fe_03_07011-B-0036)
IN A STEP BY STEP  (fe_03_07011-B-0037)
PROCESS IN ORDER TO BASICALLY DO IT SO IT GIVES YOU THE THINKING  (fe_03_07011-B-0039)
SO IN THE EDUCATION REALM IN REGARDS TO WORKING WITH COMPUTERS  (fe_03_07011-B-0040)
AS FAR AS THE CLASSROOMS IT'S GOING TO ME IT'S GOING TO BE BENEFICIAL AND I DON'T KNOW IT'S NOT TO SAY I WOULDN'T LIKE TO KNOW BUT I BELIEVE IT WILL ENHANCE THEIR EDUCATION BECAUSE MANY OF MY  (fe_03_07011-B-0041)
STUDIES I HAD TO DO PRESENTATIONS AND THEY WANTED IT TO BE TYPE WRITTEN AND IF I WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN AND THEY WANTED IT TO BE WORD PROCESSED PRETTY MUCH WAS THE REQUIREMENT  (fe_03_07011-B-0042)
SO IF I WOULD OF NEVER GOTTEN THE TRAINING IN HIGH SCHOOL I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN PREPARED TO PRESENT THAT PAPER OR THE THESIS OR WHATEVER THAT THE PROFESSOR WANTED IN THE C- CLASSROOM  (fe_03_07011-B-0043)
SO IT WILL BE NEEDED IN COLLEGE WHEN YOU GET OUTTA COLLEGE MOST OF THE JOBS NOW ARE HAVING PRESENTATIONS IF THEY GO AND BECOME A CORPORATE TRAINER MOST OF THE CORPORATE PRESENTATIONS  (fe_03_07011-B-0044)
AND THEY CIRCLE AROUND BASED ON YOU LEARNING  (fe_03_07011-B-0045)
THE COMPUTER AND THE SOFTWARE PACKAGES ESPECIALLY MI- I BELIEVE  (fe_03_07011-B-0046)
MICROSOFT OFFICE IS WHAT'S GOING  (fe_03_07011-B-0047)
THE PRESENTATIONS  (fe_03_07011-B-0049)
AND I HAD A FRIEND THAT WAS IN THE HOSPITAL LINE I HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS BUT THE THING ABOUT IT IS A LOT OF THE HOSPITAL EQUIPMENT IS NOW BECOMING COMPUTERIZED SO YOU HAVE TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE COMPUTERS  (fe_03_07011-B-0050)
YES  (fe_03_07011-B-0051)
AND ALSO I BELIEVE SOME OF THE EQUIPMENT LIKE THE C._A._T. SCANS AND ALL OF THAT IS AND THE X-RAY MACHINES ARE  (fe_03_07011-B-0052)
TRYING TO BE UPGRADED TO WHERE IT'S SOMEWHAT COMPUTERIZED AND EASY TO FUNCTION  (fe_03_07011-B-0053)
SO  (fe_03_07011-B-0054)
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS WHERE THEY'RE TRYING TO BRING IN THE COMPUTER FACET BECAUSE ONE IT'S EFFICIENT  (fe_03_07011-B-0055)
TWO IT GIVES SOMEWHAT BETTER RESULTS AND NEATER RESULTS IN THE END  (fe_03_07011-B-0056)
AND IT'S SYSTEMATIC  (fe_03_07011-B-0057)
BUT  (fe_03_07011-B-0058)
IT'S FOR THE INDIVIDUAL INSTRUCTOR  (fe_03_07011-B-0059)
TO KEEP THE CREATIVITY IN IT AND THAT PART  (fe_03_07011-B-0060)
T- HOPEFULLY IS NOT GONNA BE TAKEN AWAY BECAUSE THERE ARE COMPUTER PROJECTS TO WHERE THE TEACHER WANTS THEM TO BRING IN PROJECTS THAT THAT THEY CREATE  (fe_03_07011-B-0061)
AS FAR AS THEY CAN BRING IN BROCHURES THAT THEY'RE CREATING THEIR OWN BUSINESS AND THEY WANT TO ADVERTISE IT THROUGH A BROCHURE OR A FLYER THAT'S WHERE THE TEACHER HAS TO BE CREATIVE  (fe_03_07011-B-0062)
MOST OF MY CLASSES AH AT THIS POINT HAVE BEEN GEARED TOWARDS MATHEMATICS  (fe_03_07011-B-0063)
YEAH SO BUT THE THING ABOUT IT IS I KNOW THAT FOR A FACT A LOT OF  (fe_03_07011-B-0064)
THE COUNTING PROCESSES  (fe_03_07011-B-0065)
ARE BASICALLY  (fe_03_07011-B-0066)
GOING TO THE COMPUTER AND I WOULDN'T BELIEVE  (fe_03_07011-B-0067)
AND AS TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES IN ALL THE DISTRICTS  (fe_03_07011-B-0068)
UM I BELIEVE THAT WE'RE GONNA SEE MORE AND MORE  (fe_03_07011-B-0069)
MATHS HOMEWORK ONLINE TO WHERE THE STUDENTS CAN PULL IT  (fe_03_07011-B-0071)
FROM HOME AND THEY HAVE TO  (fe_03_07011-B-0072)
RIGHT BECAUSE A LOT OF THE UNIVERSITIES HAVE ALREADY SET UP SITES TO WHERE THEY HAVE A ONLINE TUTORIAL THAT THE STUDENTS CAN GO TO TO SEE ANSWERS SO  (fe_03_07011-B-0073)
I JUST THINK OF IT AS THE COMPUTER IS NOT YOUR ENEMY IT'S NOT  (fe_03_07011-B-0074)
AND IT MOST OF ALL YOU HAVE TO THINK OF IT AS IT'S NEEDED IN THE CLASSROOM BUT IT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY THE HUMAN FACTOR  (fe_03_07011-B-0075)
