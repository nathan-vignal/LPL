UM  (fe_03_07005-A-0008)
GOSH I DON'T KNOW THE FIRST THING THAT COMES TO MY MIND IS I I ACTUALLY WORK AT A MIDDLE SCHOOL  (fe_03_07005-A-0009)
UM AND I KNOW THAT THEY'RE KIND OF GETTING TOWARDS DOING A LOT OF PROGRAMS WITH KIDS THAT ARE KIND OF AT RISK WHERE THEY'LL PUT 'EM ON THE COMPUTER  (fe_03_07005-A-0010)
AND THEY'LL HAVE THEM WORK THROUGH MATH PRACTISE OR  (fe_03_07005-A-0011)
ENGLISH PRACTISE  (fe_03_07005-A-0012)
WITH THE COMPUTER AND AS THEY PASS LEVELS WELL THEY CAN MOVE UP AND THEY MOVE UP YOU KNOW I'M NOT REAL SURE  (fe_03_07005-A-0013)
THAT I THINK THAT'S REAL EFFECTIVE MAYBE IT'S A GOOD PRACTICE BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT I REALLY FEEL THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN MEASURE  (fe_03_07005-A-0014)
WHAT THEY'RE LEARNING  (fe_03_07005-A-0015)
OH ARE YOU  (fe_03_07005-A-0016)
I DON'T EITHER I THINK THEY CAN GO IN THERE AND THEY CAN JUST GO WELL WHAT WE HAVE IS A. PLUS AT MY SCHOOL I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THAT AND IF THEY GET IT WRONG THEY CAN JUST GO BACK THROUGH THE SAME PRACTICE AGAIN [LAUGHTER] UNTIL THEY GET IT RIGHT AND THEN MOVE UP A LEVEL  (fe_03_07005-A-0017)
MHM  (fe_03_07005-A-0018)

RIGHT IT CAN BROADEN IT AND ENHANCE IT AS FAR AS RESEARCH AND PROJECTS I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL  (fe_03_07005-A-0023)
BUT AS FAR AS A TEACHING TOOL  (fe_03_07005-A-0024)
AH UM LIKE MY YOUNGEST DAUGHTER SHE'S A SECOND GRADER GOING INTO THIRD GRADE SHE'S A TAG STUDENT AND SHE'S A COUPLE OF YEARS ABOVE  (fe_03_07005-A-0025)
HER LEVEL I DON'T WANT TO MOVE HER UP IN GRADES THIS YEAR THE TEACHER WORKED WITH HER BUNCH AND BROUGHT IN A LOT OF EXTRA THINGS NEXT YEAR THE TEACHER SHE'S GOING TO HAVE  (fe_03_07005-A-0026)
THERE'S NO I'M JUST GOING TO PUT HER ON THE COMPUTER AND LET HER WORK ON HER OWN AND A- AND JUST KIND OF MOVE ALONG AT HER OWN PACE WITHOUT ANY ACTUAL TEACHING  (fe_03_07005-A-0027)
AND I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT AT ALL  (fe_03_07005-A-0028)
I DON'T THINK SO EITHER  (fe_03_07005-A-0029)

MHM  (fe_03_07005-A-0050)
WELL SEE THAT'S WHAT BOTHERS ME ABOUT THE SCHOOLS WE HAVE KIDS THAT ARE AT RISK AND THEY REALLY SHOULDN'T BE PASSED ON TO THE NEXT GRADE NOW THIS IS MY FIRST YEAR OF DOING THIS  (fe_03_07005-A-0051)
BUT I SEE THEM AND THEY'LL SAY TO THE KIDS OKAY IF YOU CAN SIT DOWN AT WITH THIS PROGRAM AND WORK YOUR WAY THROUGH IT THEN WE'LL PASS YOU ON TO THE NEXT GRADE WELL  (fe_03_07005-A-0052)
THEY CAN DO A LESSON AND I'VE WATCHED OVER THEIR SHOULDERS THEY GET IT WRONG THEY GO BACK DOING IT IT'S A FIFTY FIFTY CHANCE ON EACH AND EVERY QUESTION WELL I GOT IT WRONG LAST TIME I'LL JUST PICK THE OTHER ANSWER AND THEN THEY JUST MOVE ON AND THEY HAVEN'T LEARNT A THING [LAUGHTER] AND UM  (fe_03_07005-A-0053)
SO WHEN IT COMES TO THAT WITH A COMPUTER I'M THINKING NO NO NO  (fe_03_07005-A-0054)
BUT THEN WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WITH MARY AH THAT SOUNDS WONDERFUL AND WE DO WE'VE GOT A LANGUAGE ARTS TEACHER THAT DOES WONDERFUL THINGS WITH UM POWERPOINT AND I AND MY I MYSELF I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THAT BUT THE THINGS THAT KIDS DO WITH IT IT'S JUST AMAZING  (fe_03_07005-A-0055)

AND THEY'VE DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH PAPERS AND PUT POWER POINT'S TOGETHER AND THINGS BUT THEN IT SEEMS LIKE THEY GET INTO MIDDLE SCHOOL AND THAT PORTION  (fe_03_07005-A-0066)
TH- UM THE RESEARCH AND THINGS WE DON'T HAVE AS MANY COMPUTERS IN OUR MIDDLE SCHOOLS THEY DO IN THE ELEMENTARY IT KIND OF FALLS AWAY THEN THEY GET INTO HIGH SCHOOL AND THEY GET BACK IN  (fe_03_07005-A-0067)

AND AH I'VE SEEN THE  (fe_03_07005-B-0010)
YOU KNOW THE THE PLAY DOUGH PROGRAMS AND THE NOVA NET AND ALL THOSE AND I  (fe_03_07005-B-0011)
YOU KNOW I  (fe_03_07005-B-0012)
I UNDERSTAND THAT FOR AT RISK KIDS THEY CAN GET CREDIT THAT WAY AND THAT'S A GOOD THING  (fe_03_07005-B-0013)
BUT  (fe_03_07005-B-0014)
I DON'T THINK  (fe_03_07005-B-0015)
THEY'RE THERE'S IF THERE'S NO CONNECTION WITH THE TEACHER  (fe_03_07005-B-0016)
I DON'T THINK THERE'S MUCH TRANSFER  (fe_03_07005-B-0017)
Y-  (fe_03_07005-B-0018)
RIGHT  (fe_03_07005-B-0020)
RIGHT RIGHT AND I'VE WORKED WITH KIDS IN THE SAME WAY AND THEY THEY'RE WORKING WITH THIS WITH AN ALGEBRA PROGRAM AND I DON'T TEACH ALGEBRA SO I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW IT WORKS BUT I'VE TALKED TO THEM ABOUT IT AND THEY  (fe_03_07005-B-0021)
THEY  (fe_03_07005-B-0022)
THEY DON'T LIKE IT WHEN THEY DON'T GET TO USE THE COMPUTERS AND I SAID WHY DO YOU LIKE THE COM- AND THEY SAID WELL 'CAUSE WE CAN FINALLY GUESS IT RIGHT [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_07005-B-0023)
AND AH BUT I THINK YOU KNOW  (fe_03_07005-B-0024)
ASIDE FR- I THINK AS HARD AS  (fe_03_07005-B-0025)
I MEAN OBVIOUSLY COMPUTERS ARE GOING TO BE A PART OF EDUCATION  (fe_03_07005-B-0026)
AH AND  (fe_03_07005-B-0027)
AND AND WE HAVE THOSE KIDS HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO USE THE COMPUTER  (fe_03_07005-B-0028)
AND BUT I THINK THE BIGGEST  (fe_03_07005-B-0029)
PERHAPS THE BIGGEST DRAWBACK RIGHT NOW IS THAT THE TEACHERS HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO USE THE COMPUTERS  (fe_03_07005-B-0030)
AND AH  (fe_03_07005-B-0031)
AND KNOW HOW YOU CAN USE IT EFFECTIVELY  (fe_03_07005-B-0032)
IN YOUR CLASSROOM TO SUPPORT YOUR LEARNING  (fe_03_07005-B-0033)
YOU KNOW WHERE IT'S NOT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE AN END IN ITSELF BUT JUST A WAY THAT IT CAN MAKE NOT YOUR LEARNING YOU'RE TEACHING IT CAN MAKE YOUR TEACHING  (fe_03_07005-B-0035)
MORE EFFECTIVE  (fe_03_07005-B-0036)
AND  (fe_03_07005-B-0037)
RIGHT  (fe_03_07005-B-0038)

UH-HUH  (fe_03_07005-B-0041)
YEAH  (fe_03_07005-B-0043)
YEAH AND YOU KNOW IF AH YOUR DAUGHTER WHO'S ADVANCED SHE MAY BE SUCCESSFUL WITH THAT  (fe_03_07005-B-0044)
BUT I DON'T THINK IT'LL BE MUCH FUN  (fe_03_07005-B-0045)
AND YOU KNOW IT'S IF THERE'S NOT A WHOLE IF THERE'S NOT ANY JOY  (fe_03_07005-B-0046)
IN THE LEARNING  (fe_03_07005-B-0047)
YOU KNOW I THINK THAT'S PRETTY SAD PARTICULARLY WHEN THEY'RE YOU KNOW AS YOUNG AS YOUR DAUGHTER IS  (fe_03_07005-B-0048)
YOU KNOW ONCE THEY ONCE THEY GET TO HIGH SCHOOL I GUESS THEY DON'T EXPECT [LAUGHTER] MUCH JOY [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_07005-B-0049)
SO IT MAY NOT MATTER  (fe_03_07005-B-0050)
I HAVE SEEN I WE HAVE ONE TEACHER AT OUR SCHOOL WHO HAS DONE WONDERFUL THINGS WITH THE COMPUTER IN HER ENGLISH CLASS  (fe_03_07005-B-0051)
SHE WILL  (fe_03_07005-B-0053)
VIDE- WELL VIDEO TAPE THE KIDS  (fe_03_07005-B-0054)
DOING WHATEVER THEY'RE DOING ON A DAY  (fe_03_07005-B-0055)
AND THEN DURING THE PASSING PERIOD AS THAT CLASS COMES IN  (fe_03_07005-B-0056)
SHE'S GOT THE GOT IT ON HER COMPUTER  (fe_03_07005-B-0057)
AND I MEAN I'M NOT FAMILIAR ENOUGH WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT SOFTWARE SHE'S USING ON THAT AND SO THE KIDS ARE WATCHING THEIR THEIR WORK FROM THE DAY BEFORE AS THEY COME IN  (fe_03_07005-B-0058)
AND THEY'RE REAL EXCITED TO GET TO CLASS  (fe_03_07005-B-0059)
'CAUSE THEY WANT TO SEE THEMSELVES ON T._V.  (fe_03_07005-B-0060)
AND PLUS I THINK IT SUPPLEMENTS YOU KNOW A REVIEW  (fe_03_07005-B-0061)
IT KIND OF RE- AH VERY INFORMALLY AND IN A VERY NON THREATENING WAY SHE'S  (fe_03_07005-B-0062)
REVIEWED  (fe_03_07005-B-0063)
WHAT THEY DID YESTERDAY  (fe_03_07005-B-0064)

[LAUGHTER] THEY'VE ALREADY GONE THROUGH THE REVIEW AND AH  (fe_03_07005-B-0066)
SHE ALSO DOES UM  (fe_03_07005-B-0067)
SHE HAS SOME KIND OF UM  (fe_03_07005-B-0068)
SHE  (fe_03_07005-B-0069)
HER STUDENTS EMAIL  (fe_03_07005-B-0070)
AN INSTANT MESSAGE KIDS IN IN ANOTHER STATE  (fe_03_07005-B-0071)
AH AND THEY'RE THEY'RE WORKING ON AH WELL THEY WERE THE SCHOOL'S OVER FOR US NOW SO BUT THEY WERE WORKING ON SOME KIND OF A JOINT PROJECT  (fe_03_07005-B-0072)
A RESEARCH PROJECT AND UM  (fe_03_07005-B-0073)
SO THE KIDS COMMUNICATE BACK AND FORTH AND I THINK THAT'S VERY EXCITING  (fe_03_07005-B-0074)
YOU KNOW FOR THE STUDENTS  (fe_03_07005-B-0075)
BUT MOST OF OUR TEACHERS  (fe_03_07005-B-0076)
DON'T HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE TO DO  (fe_03_07005-B-0077)
WHAT MARY DOES  (fe_03_07005-B-0078)
YOU KNOW WHERE  (fe_03_07005-B-0079)
WE WEREN'T RAISED WITH THE COMPUTERS [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_07005-B-0080)
AND IT'S WE'RE NOT AS ADEPT BUT I THINK IF WE COULD ALL  (fe_03_07005-B-0082)
YOU KNOW DEVELOP THOSE SKILLS  (fe_03_07005-B-0083)
IT WOULD OPEN ALL SORTS OF DOORS  (fe_03_07005-B-0084)
AH FOR ME I I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THAT MUCH WITH IT  (fe_03_07005-B-0087)

OH AND YOU KNOW AND THE K- THE KIDS CAN SIT DOWN AND DO THEIR OWN RESEARCH AND AND USE POWERPOINT  (fe_03_07005-B-0107)
THEY COME UP WITH WONDERFUL THINGS AND THAT'S REALLY EXCITING TO ME TO SEE WHAT WHAT THEY CAN DO WITH A COMPUTER WHICH IS SO MUCH MORE THAN I CAN [LAUGHTER] IT'S  (fe_03_07005-B-0108)
RIGHT  (fe_03_07005-B-0110)
RIGHT RIGHT BUT THAT'S THAT'S THEN OF COURSE WITH THE RESEARCH WITH OUR HIGH SCHOOL KIDS THERE'S ALWAYS THE PROBLEM WITH THEM YOU KNOW PLAGIARIZING OFF THE INTERNET  (fe_03_07005-B-0111)
AND IT'S IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO  (fe_03_07005-B-0112)
[MN] WE DON'T KNOW ALL THE PLACES THEY KNOW [LAUGHTER] ON THEM [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] AND IT'S I THINK IT OPENS UP A WHOLE  (fe_03_07005-B-0113)
YOU KNOW A WHOLE CAN OF WORMS  (fe_03_07005-B-0114)
IN THAT YOU HAVE TO TO DEAL WITH  (fe_03_07005-B-0115)
AND AND THEN AND THEN  (fe_03_07005-B-0116)
I THINK YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE COMPUTER  (fe_03_07005-B-0117)
WE'VE GOT TO TEACH THE STUDENTS HOW TO USE IT AND HOW TO EVALUATE IT YOU KNOW PARTICULARLY THE INTERNET  (fe_03_07005-B-0118)
AH HOW TO KNOW  (fe_03_07005-B-0119)
YOU KNOW TO CONVINCE THEM THAT ANYBODY CAN SAY THEY'RE AN EXPERT  (fe_03_07005-B-0120)
ON THE INTERNET  (fe_03_07005-B-0121)
BUT THEY MAY OR MAY NOT KNOW ANYTHING  (fe_03_07005-B-0122)
ABOUT THE SUBJECT THEY'RE WRITING ON  (fe_03_07005-B-0123)
YOU KNOW IT AT LEAST WHEN YOU'RE GETTING IT FROM BOOKS SOMEBODY HAD TO THINK ENOUGH OF THAT PERSON TO PUBLISH THE BOOK  (fe_03_07005-B-0124)
AH NOW NOBODY HAS TO APPROVE ANYTHING AND  (fe_03_07005-B-0125)
