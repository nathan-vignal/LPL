HI MY NAME'S LORRIE  (fe_03_07012-B-0002)
OKAY  (fe_03_07012-B-0003)
OH YOU DID [LAUGHTER] THIS IS ABOUT MY THIRD CALL SO IT'S KIND OF FUN  (fe_03_07012-B-0004)
UM THEY SAY WE'RE SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT COMPUTERS AND EDUCATION  (fe_03_07012-B-0005)
UM I THINK THAT IT'S A GOOD THING I KNOW WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL THEY REALLY DIDN'T USE COMPUTERS UM UNTIL I GOT INTO HIGH SCHOOL  (fe_03_07012-B-0006)
AND WITH MY DAUGHTERS THEY START 'EM ON IT IN KINDERGARTEN AND IT'S JUST AMAZING WHAT THESE KIDS CAN DO WITH THE COMPUTER THEY UM  (fe_03_07012-B-0007)
I MEAN MY KIDS KNOW MORE ABOUT COMPUTERS THAN I DO [LAUGHTER] AND THEY'RE NINE AND SIX SO  (fe_03_07012-B-0008)
I THINK SO TOO I THINK UM I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO NEED THAT ADVANTAGE BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO GOING TO USE COMPUTERS MORE AND MORE AS TIME GOES ON AND UM  (fe_03_07012-B-0010)
[LIPSMACK] I MEAN I USE IT DAILY JUST I I WORK AT HOME BUT I USE IT DAILY AND I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW MUCH PEOPLE MUST USE IT IN THE WORKPLACE [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_07012-B-0011)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_07012-B-0012)
RIGHT  (fe_03_07012-B-0013)
RIGHT  (fe_03_07012-B-0014)
WELL I THINK THAT'S A GOOD POINT AND I ALSO AH THE THING THAT I NOTICE ABOUT THOSE GAMES IS THEY SEEM TO HELP MY OLDER DAUGHTER WAS A PREEMIE AND I'VE NOTICED WITH HER THAT UM  (fe_03_07012-B-0015)
SHE'S ALWAYS ABOUT SIX MONTHS BEHIND OTHER KIDS ON LIKE MANUAL DEXTERITY AND PHYSICAL THINGS SHE GETS THERE EVENTUALLY BUT SHE'S JUST A LITTLE BIT BEHIND THE KIDS THAT ARE HER HER AGE  (fe_03_07012-B-0016)
AND I'VE NOTICED SINCE SHE STARTED DOING LIKE YOU KNOW LITTLE NINTENDO GAMES AND STUFF THAT SHE SEEMS TO HAVE IMPROVED ON THAT AND I REALLY THINK THAT UM  (fe_03_07012-B-0017)
YOU KNOW THAT HAS HELPED HER A- HAND EYE COORDINATION EVEN THOUGH IT SOUNDS KIND OF SILLY [LAUGHTER] UM BUT THE THING THAT I FIND WITH THEM IS TOO YOU DO HAVE TO LIMIT THEIR TIME  (fe_03_07012-B-0018)
ON THE COMPUTER AND ON THE VIDEO GAMES BECAUSE THEY WILL HAPPILY SIT IN FRONT OF THAT COMPUTER SCREEN OR THAT VIDEO GAME ALL DAY LONG AND NEVER EVER GO OUTSIDE AND GET ANY PHYSICAL ACTIVITY SO  (fe_03_07012-B-0019)
I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A BALANCE  (fe_03_07012-B-0020)
MHM  (fe_03_07012-B-0021)
OH REALLY [MN] [NOISE]  (fe_03_07012-B-0022)

WELL THAT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THEY HAVE UM ALSO DONE STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT IF YOU USE LIKE CROSSWORD PUZZLES YOU'RE LESS LIKELY TO GET ALZHEIMERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE KEEPING YOUR BRAIN ACTIVE SO IT MAKES SENSE THAT THIS WOULD  (fe_03_07012-B-0025)
WOULD HELP IN THAT AREA TOO BECAUSE LIKE YOU SAID YOU HAVE TO MEMORIZE PATTERNS AND HOW TO WIN THINGS AND ALL THAT AND THERE'S A LOT TO REMEMBER IN SOME OF THOSE GAMES  (fe_03_07012-B-0026)
RIGHT  (fe_03_07012-B-0027)

AND THEY HAVE LIKE YOU KNOW BEGINNING READER HELPING 'EM DO GAMES THAT TEACH THEM PHONICS AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND AND I REALLY THINK THAT IT HAS HELPED THEM BECAUSE BOTH OF MY DAUGHTERS ARE IN GIFTED AND TALENTED PROGRAMS AT SCHOOL WITH THEIR READING AND  (fe_03_07012-B-0031)
YES I'VE WORKED WITH THEM SOME BUT I KNOW THAT THE COMPUTER HAS HELPED AS WELL BECAUSE THEY'RE SPENDING THE TIME AND THEY THINK THEY'RE PLAYING [LAUGHTER] SO THEY'RE MORE WILLING TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON IT BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY BEING EDUCATED SO IT'S ALMOST LIKE HAVING A LITTLE TEACHER  (fe_03_07012-B-0032)
IN THEIR BEDROOM [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW [NOISE]  (fe_03_07012-B-0033)
RIGHT  (fe_03_07012-B-0034)

UM MAKE A TEACHER'S JOB MORE EFFICIENT BECAUSE INSTEAD OF HAVING TO GO THROUGH AND ADD UP ALL THE SCORES FOR THE SEMESTER SHE CAN PUNCH THEM INTO A COMPUTER PROGRAM AND THAT LETS HER HAVE MORE TIME TO  (fe_03_07012-B-0041)
OR HIM HAVE MORE TIME TO UM YOU KNOW FOCUS ON THE ACTUAL LESSONS AND HOW TO HELP INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS THAN TO HAVE TO SPEND ALL THAT TIME ADDING UP GRADES AND DOING KIND OF THE UM  (fe_03_07012-B-0042)
MANUAL LABOR OF TEACHING SO I THINK THAT UM COMPUTERS HAVE REALLY HELPED KIND OF YOU KNOW THE FLIPSIDE IN EDUCATION HELPED THE TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATION TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE  (fe_03_07012-B-0043)
MHM  (fe_03_07012-B-0044)

ALL THIS KNOWLEDGE AND AND LEARNING AND THE COMPUTERS WHERE EVERY CHILD IN THE CLASSROOM HAS A COMPUTER AND HERE ARE THESE OTHER KIDS WHO ARE FALLING BEHIND AND AND THAT IS I DO GET CONCERNED ABOUT THAT EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT MY CHILDREN I I WORRY ABOUT 'EM SOMETIMES AND I WONDER IF  (fe_03_07012-B-0058)
