R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  I'm Carissa.  How are you?
R:  Hi.  I'm fine and I'm Jessica.
L:  [NOISE] Well, I guess we're supposed to talk about um [SIGH] --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- whether or not you can -- [NOISE] y- your schools can regulate [NOISE] books that are read.
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Okay um, so what's your opinion?  Do you think -- do you think they --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- should be able to?  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Um [LIPSMACK] --
L:  [NOISE] Well --
R:  -- I think [MN] --
L:  Go ahead.
R:  No, I was just saying I think that uh I don't --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- think they should because [SIGH] unless -- unless they're voted by the parents you know, that um certain books you know -- because certain books may --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- may have an affect you know that um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- on -- on the -- on -- on the students you know that maybe is undesirable --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know?  And maybe um 
L:  [MN] [SIGH] Um I -- I agree.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  There're certain books that I wouldn't want my children --
R:  Right.
L:  -- reading --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- there're other books --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that I wouldn't mind.
R:  Right -- right.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I think it has to be voted by the parent, you know.  I think they shou- -- [NOISE] if thi- -- if they should have a [MN] a -- a um -- a book --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [MN] you know that was going to be mandatory to read --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they just send a notice to the parents and say, "This book is mandatory to read" and then if not then get an excuse from the parents saying well, they don't want their children reading that book [SIGH] or a different book or something.  So I think -- I think you know it should be -- it should be um -- there should be censorship, [SIGH] you know.  And both the Ca- -- you know, it's like um regular schools and -- and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and um private schools, you know.  Um [LIPSMACK] -- but uh, um --
L:  [NOISE] [NOISE] 
R:  -- what else do you think? [LAUGH]  I think uh, let's see uh 
L:  Oh, I mean I -- I [SIGH] -- I think it's a good thing 'cause there are some parents that would let their children read certain books that I wouldn't want my kid reading --
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  -- and I wouldn't want my kid having access to those books at school. [NOISE] 
R:  Right -- right.
L:  So I mean i- it would still -- there are some --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- aspects to it that are good.
R:  But don't all -- don't all -- don't all schools have libraries where the kids can -- you know, if they really wanted to read that book, they could go pick it up?  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  You know, they're -- they're -- themselves without anybody knowing about it?  You know?  I mean it's --
L:  In a public library I can see --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but if the -- if the school regulates --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- what the -- what the kids could read I wouldn't think that they would have certain books there.
R:  Uh-huh.  Oh, you think so? 
L:  But [MN] you mean --
R:  [MN] Yeah, I know it's been a while since I been at school and I -- I was um trying to remember back when -- when you know, I was going to school that it -- if I was -- it was mandatory to read certain books and [SIGH] -- and I don't think we ever had to do that, you know.  I think it was just the text books that we had to read and uh --
L:  Yeah I think so.
R:  -- yeah and it was uh -- maybe it's different now.  I don't know how different it is now you know.  It's been about [NOISE] [MN] -- oh gosh, it's been about, you know, twenty years since I been to school so [SIGH] -- so maybe things have changed you know.  That um --
L:  [several inaudible words]  
R:  -- I'm not sure of the -- of the -- the you know, what they have now.  Do y- -- so do your children ever tell you that they -- [NOISE] that they have to read books?  Do your children ever [NOISE] --
L:  They're not in school yet.
R:  Oh they're not in school yet?  Oh, okay.
L:  I mean I haven't -- we haven't experienced that. 
R:  Uh-huh, okay.
L:  I'm sure I'll get into that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I mean --
R:  Okay -- okay so y- -- so --
L:  -- I don't know. I'm one of those parents that --
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  -- I don't want my -- I don't want to expose my children to too much but yet we live in a society where you can't keep 'em --
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  -- hidden from everything.  I mean, they're going to learn more at school --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- than they're gonna learn anywhere else.
R:  Well, I think if you're open and honest with your children and -- and you have a good relationship with your children, [SIGH] they'll ask --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- certain things, you know.  I mean you could be able to talk --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to them about certain things and tell 'em that you know -- tell 'em what you think about that subject.  You know, if you have a good relationship with your children I think that's the most important thing to have. [SIGH] 
L:  I agree.
R:  You know, whether --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know we- [MN] um -- maybe they might you know -- 'cause I know -- I know they're subject to so -- you know, so many things you know [SIGH] in this world and you can't keep them from everything [SIGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but I think if you have a good relationship with your children that that would -- that would help um [SIGH] if they -- if they'd picked up certain --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- material and maybe --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- wanted to discuss it with you --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- or -- you asked them you know, to discuss it with you.  What did they think about it?  And so you would know where they're coming from [SIGH] -- 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- so they won't get the -- so -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- so that they have a censorship -- a little bit of censorship from you --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know on that subject. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  You know?
L:  I think that's more important than anything is having a good relationship with your child --
R:  Yeah -- yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  -- even if --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there is something in a [NOISE] book or something that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they learn from the school.  If you don't have a good relationship --
R:  Right.
L:  -- a good foundation with your [NOISE] child then --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it doesn't matter what they've read --
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  -- it's gonna --
R:  Yeah, because I think if you didn't have a good relationship they would -- you know they would make their own opinions and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I think they need more input from the parents on -- on certain things that they've read or they've seen or --
L:  And parents need to be involved in --
R:  -- you know?  Yeah.  The uh -- yeah.
L:  -- what's going on and what's out in the schools.  
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  I think it should be more the parents' decision instead of the --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the teacher or the administrators and --
R:  Yeah, I think --
L:  -- school.
R:  -- so too.  I -- I agree with that.  I agree -- I agree that -- that the parents should be more involved in [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah, you know, I don't know if they go -- if they still have um student teacher [NOISE] -- you know um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- things like that go on in um, uh -- well, they -- they used to like have um -- um meetings at schools you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- where the parents would go to school and --
L:  [inaudible] PTA and some --
R:  -- they would talk about different things --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and so I think they still do that so I think that would be a good issue to raise, you know.  If they --
L:  I think so.
R:  -- if they are teaching the children [SIGH] you know, certain things and -- and get -- be aware.  I think the parents should be aware [SIGH] first of all of what --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know what's going on t- school.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  You know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they should participate in -- in the -- in the, you know, school programs --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and -- and things that you know go on the schools so that they'd be aware of what kind of material their children are reading so they can [SIGH] -- so they can have a voice and say, "Yes" or "No".  You know?
L:  Mm.
R:  Whether they want their child to read this or not, you know.  [SIGH] Or [MN] you know maybe certain things they could read together.  You know?
L:  Right [inaudible] --
R:  Um, certain things might be -- might be -- they might not understand --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- but if you read it together with your child --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the -- that would -- that would broaden their horizons and they would -- they -- they would see a different --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- point or -- or --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- or um --
L:  [NOISE] Could help [inaudible] 
R:  -- it wouldn't be as intimidating as if they read it by themselves or didn't understand it, you know.
L:  Exactly.  [several inaudible words] 
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah --
L:  Maybe understand it more.
R:  Uh, so how old are your kids?
L:  Uh, two and four.
R:  Ah, two and four [LAUGH] okay, yeah.
L:  So I have a while before I get there. [inaudible] 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] But that's still something good to think about because you know, it's something like where're you gonna put your school -- if you're gonna put your school -- ah your kids in private school or a +public school?  You know?  So it's good to, you know, think about that now.  You know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you had a -- you had a -- you have all this time to think about that now --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, to decide whether you know, to um -- to go investigate the schools you know?  W- --
L:  Yeah, that is one issue that I never thought about with my children --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- is what kind of material they would be reading --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and that's [several inaudible words] 
R:  So, now you have the time, you know.  Before they -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- before they even go to school you have the time to talk to the, you know -- go -- go make the appointments with your teacher -- uh, with a teacher or [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- or the principal or -- and talk to somebody about what kind of um in- information -- books they're -- they -- their [SIGH] -- their mandatory reading, you know.  It's a good time now to do that, you know, before they start.  Be- -- even before they start --
L:  You know -- 
R:  -- so you can know ahead of time. [NOISE] 
L:  -- even on the same standpoint I don't want my kids reading material that's negative --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- any more they're --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- getting to where they don't want 'em reading religious materials either, but I'm going [several inaudible words] that.  I want my kids to be very religious and   
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  If they want to read the Bible [several inaudible words].
R:  Oh, that's -- that's a touchy sub- -- that's a touchy subject.  Religion is very touchy --
L:  Yes.  Exactly.
R:  -- because you know it's a very touchy subject in um -- you know like when they were taking -- I think they are -- they already taken the prayer out of --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- school, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then they wanted -- they wanted to put it back but --
L:  And then the pledge --
R:  -- [SIGH] but --
L:  -- they wanted to take it out, you know.
R:  Yeah, [SIGH] but --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know our country was --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- founded on -- on --
L:  On religion.
R:  -- on religion --
L:  Exactly.  And if I want my children [inaudible] -- 
R:  -- you know and I don't see --
L:  -- that.
R:  -- uh um, I don't see --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- how [MN] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- uh a prayer could really hurt, you know.
L:  Well, we --
R:  Or something like that you know?
L:  -- now we finished it [inaudible] the first [inaudible] you know.
R:  I think in- intensive teaching would be different you know, because you might [SIGH] -- you know Jehovah's Witnesses have different -- have different um  um ideas than -- than the Catholics you know.  Oh and the -- the [inaudible] says you can't push --
L:  Right.  You can't --
R:  -- a certain religion --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- but I think if --
L:  If there's a sense of -- 
R:  -- I think if they're aware of a higher power of God, you know -- if they pray --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- to their own you know -- let them -- 
L:  Let them pray their own way.
R:  -- let them know that -- that they pray their way you know, that --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that -- to their god, that that would be okay, yeah.  'Cause um I -- I -- I -- I think +religion should be in schools because that's what our -- you know our -- our whole um nation was founded on is --
L:  [inaudible] right.
R:  -- is re- you know, freedom of religion and [SIGH] -- and um, but um --
L:  But look where it's gotten us today without it in certain areas.  It's, I mean --
R:  Yeah, you know.  'Cause we're forgetting God in -- you know we're forgetting --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- God in the schools and it's just like -- it's just like -- it's like [SIGH] you know, children need that kind of ah -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um --
L:  They need that guidance and yeah -- yeah -- yeah.
R:  -- guidance.  You know, our relationship -- you know, they need to know where they come from and why they're here and --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- you know?  'Cause I remember growing up -- I had so many questions.  You know I --
L:  There are --
R:  -- had so many questions about --
L:  -- so many sayings in the world you know.  The children --
R:  Yeah. [SIGH] 
L:  -- face so many trials and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- tribulations [SIGH] and without God and without being able to --
R:  Right. [SIGH] 
L:  -- I mean if they had -- I feel like if they empo- -- in- um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- put something you know where they were able to read the Bible for so many --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- hours a day out of a school day --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I think we'd have better students.  
R:  Yeah, I think so.  
L:  Child- children would learn more --
R:  That -- yeah I think so too. [SIGH] --
L:  [several inaudible words] what they [inaudible]  
R:  Right.  You know, because there's so much violence in schools and there's so much --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- you know -- people, they -- they're  because I -- I used uh to live in a building where there -- there w- -- it was near a school.  And I would walk outside and I would hear these kids how they talk and they're very -- they were -- they talked bad language.  They [SIGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know they were ve- -- they were like um -- they were very promiscuous and -- and at a --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- young age, you know.  At a very young age.  I mean I think it was high [NOISE] school you know but they're  [SIGH] You know I saw, you know a couple of kids even going really heavy at it you know, and it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [MN] -- in ah public you know.  [SIGH] And I think they need that -- that moral guidance --
L:  I think so too.
R:  -- you know.  It's -- there's -- you know, there's a [SIGH] -- um, educational guidance is good but moral guidance is also good too.  
L:  Y- well, it's more important.
R:  You know?  And -- and I think they -- they both -- the- they can both go together, you know.  
L:  Right.  Exactly.
R:  And -- and live happily if -- if it's done correctly you know.  If -- if it's not done to insult, you know, certain -- or exclude certain religions, you know.  
L:  Right.
R:  So I think that, yeah that would [MN] [NOISE] --
L:  Well, it -- it's a very important thing.  It's -- I -- I would want to be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- involved in what my [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what the school decided that my children read.  I mean [several inaudible words] --
R:  Right, yeah.  I think I would s- -- yeah, I would too.  [SIGH] Yeah, because it's very impor- --
