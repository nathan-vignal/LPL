L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello, my name is Barry Fair.
R:  Hi, I'm Kim Hearn.  Um, [LIPSMACK] so, the -- the topic's about not reading certain books in schools.
L:  Well, what type of books are you referring to though?
R:  Um, I don't know.  It just [LAUGH] --
L:  Well, there -- there's a big issue about the, uh, I r- -- uh, lately I heard there's a big issue about the Harry Potter books because they are stated that the, uh, there's a lot of witchcraft in 'em and I have the books and I've read some of them, not all of them.  And I don't really think --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that, you know, there's too much to worry about.  Unless you're talking about kids that are, you know, under five of six if they go to the library.  And then the only way you can stop something like that is well, you'd have to be over, like, say ten or twelve to read the books.
R:  Mhm.  Really, I guess I don't see why any of those -- I don't know if they're talking about books that are required reading or what.  But, um, I would certainly think that books that are recommended reading in schools should have some -- some, uh, educational purpose, as opposed to just straight fiction.
L:  Well, then, yeah, well, that's fiction and it's sort of, uh, leisure -- [MN] leisure, uh, it -- you should be able to read it leisurely your time and if there's no, um, in classes there's -- there's no [MN] book like that that they use for --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- any, you know purpose at all --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that I can, you know, that I know of.  And, um, there's a lot of other books too that they don't -- and in some schools there's the, uh, books on, like, the National Geographics 'cause that's more of a magazine than a book,
R:  Mhm.
L:  But the writers of the book are -- are pretty good on 'specially, you know different type of animals and then, uh, interpretation of, uh, the, uh, [PAUSE] way the earth is, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- evolving and what's going to happen in the future --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, with the, uh, [PAUSE] the sun and everything and, you know, the heat that's, you know, in certain parts of the world, which is really out of sight.  And then you've got up in, uh, the mid west where all the fires are and everything and there's not enough water there.  Any -- any wonder, you know, what's going to happen to the generation of kids in say two thousand twenty or two thousand two twenty five?  What are they going to have to look forward to?
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, that's the reason why I say, you know certain books, you know like National Geographic -- 'cause there's other books on, you know, uh, what's going to happen in the future and in some cases -- in some areas, parents don't like to have books like that in -- in the -- in -- even in classes but it's still part of your history.  And it's just like people learn about the history of United States from, you know, like seventeen hundred and up, you know, Washington, and, Grant, and Leems[?], Civil War and so forth, you know.
R:  Mhm.  I think they're --
L:  Because I thought they were very interesting, you know, when I, you know, when I was in school.
R:  Mm.
L:  And there isn't probably [LIPSMACK] any -- any -- [LAUGH] any newer books probably because [LAUGH] there's nobody that's really into stuff like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Into like it was in -- I'm saying the sixties 'cause I'm a little bit older probably than you also [PAUSE] as far as age.  I don't really know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- how old you are but, you know, I was -- I went to school in, you know, like late fifties, early sixties --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- high school.  And [MN] the way they teach then versus now, is a little bit different because you have a lot of, you know, lot of different issues too, in way they teach and everything.  There's the busing, you know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and the kids from one area to the other I think which is wrong too.  I don't know what you -- your opinion on that is, because I think that if somebody lives close to a school, within three blocks, they shouldn't be bused to another school five miles away.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And not only -- mainly was done be- because they're trying to make the, uh, area in schools that are black, fifty, fifty, which they'll never do.  And a good example is the one over in, um, uh, near that park there -- Reisenstein[?].  'Cause I had a friend that was a teacher and the principal there, when they first started that about eighteen -- maybe fifteen years ago.  It was supposed to be for, um, [PAUSE] [SIGH] kids, you know, s'posed to be, like, seventy percent white and thirty percent black.  It ended up the other way.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they never -- they've never really changed it because of the busing.  'Cause they do the same think there I believe.  They bus kids in from different areas.  [PAUSE] And the only reason why they probably d- -- you know, I think the way they do the busing is they feel that the blacks will be getting a better education and it sort of balances out, you know, where there is some, you know, majority may be the whites and then -- and blacks should work together but, you know, I guess that they don't do that as a rule.
R:  Right.  
L:  The mi- -- am I supposed to be doing most of the talking?
R:  [LAUGH] Well --
L:  Mi- -- I -- 
R:  -- I think we kinda got off the subject of books.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I mean, there, you know, uh, then you -- you get back on the books on -- on -- on the other thing too.  Because they've brought them out in the last ten or fifteen years too on, uh, black related books.  There's a lot of areas that are mainly white and actually the schools -- they're -- if  th- -- if the parents or the board is actually set up that way where there's more whites than blacks on the board, then they're going to vote those type of books out.  As far as black education I couldn't think of the word.
R:  Mm.
L:  That's what I'm trying to say, you know, the black --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- education part was actually never really brought into the picture until maybe the last ten or fifteen years -- twenty years maybe.  Even --
R:  I think that, uh, [MN] I mean, there currently, like a lot of books that are considered classics involve a lot of violence.  You know, where as I --
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  -- look at a book like Harry Potter and to me it's just creativity.
L:  True.
R:  You know, I don't look at it like, you know, kids are going to start devil worshipping or anything like that.  I think it's really creative and just fantasy with all kind of things.
L:  But yet when the book came out two weeks ago it sold out.  Everywhere.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- you're right.  This -- 
R:  And it's -- I mean --
L:  -- that's the third or fourth ver- -- 
R:  -- like unicorns, you know [LAUGH] --
L:  -- well, they -- well, what it is i- --
R:  -- they're not real but [LAUGH] --
L:  --  well, what it -- see what it is -- everything -- well, put it this way -- everything as far as in books -- like they say, clothes -- comes back and so, same thing I think in books.   The only thing is the writers -- 'cause me -- were probably better [PAUSE] [LIPSMACK] from the forties to the seventies, than from -- from the last -- seventy five up until now.  There's probably better books from back ways --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- than there are now, as far as, you know, as educational books and, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- well, like I say, you still have, like you said, they're classic, you know, like, Moby Dick and Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea and so forth, you know.  But again, that falls in the same category too.  You know --
R:  Right. 
L:  -- they're sort of entertaining books.  And my, you know, and to an extent this is what Harry Potter would be.  The only difference is, it's a different time, a different era.  If you had those books back then, it might not have fazed anybody. 
R:  I think most of the --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- problem goes back to, um, parental problems.  You know, if -- if kids are reading books and the parents are involved to help explain the concepts and behaviors, you know, kids can't take it a step beyond what it's meant to be, and either, you know, get into thinking that it's okay to kill people or have affairs or, you know, try to become a wizard or sorcerer.  Whereas -- 
L:  Well, see that's what the -- th- -- 
R:  -- you know, most --
L:  -- that's what I'm trying --
R:  -- most parents will explain that to their kids that, you know behaviors like that --
L:  -- that's what I'm --
R:  -- are incorrect.
L:  -- trying to say too.  In the last twenty years, there's more books that are printed -- th- -- well, the same thing goes with a program on TV 'cause that's another subject --
R:  Exactly.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- but the i- -- huh?
R:  Exactly.
L:  B- but the books that they have --
R:  You know, it's the same thing.
L:  -- that were older, not saying that there wasn't, you know, vul- vulgarity in some of the books but a lot of the books that were older, you know, like, that were out in the forties and fifties and some in the sixties; if it had any types of swear word or any type of well, pictures, which is very unlikely [inaudible] then --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- they were banned from school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like Lady Chatterley's Lover for an example.  You know, that's sort of a classic but yet there's a lot of [MN] --
