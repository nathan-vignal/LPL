R:  [NOISE] Noeline Wilson
L:  [NOISE] Hello? [NOISE] 
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.  Yes, my name is Susan.  How are you?
R:  Just fine.  How are you?
L:  Just fine. [NOISE] 
R:  Well good.
L:  [NOISE] So we're supposed to talk [NOISE] about uh whether schools are supposed t- to -- whether schools are allowed to have kids read certain books? [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, I guess so.  
L:  Okay --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- what you feel [NOISE] about that?
R:  Well, I think it's depending on [NOISE] the book.  I mean you know, uh -- uh I think some of 'em should, yeah.  But it's dependent -- to my way of [NOISE] knowledge it's --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- depending on the book.
L:  Yeah.  I think the -- the parents should be involved.
R:  Well, of course.  Yes.  I do too.  I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah -- yeah, [NOISE] that's right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know I mean --
L:  [MN] Well, teachers require kids to read books and the kids -- and the parents don't know anything about it.  I think that's [NOISE] wrong.
R:  Well, I do too and a lot of times the parents don't know things and that -- you know you're right.  I didn't think about that, yes.  [SIGH] But of course, I think the parents should be involved.
L:  Yeah -- yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Are your -- are your children grown?
R:  Oh gosh, yes.  I'm nine- uh -- nine --
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- uh I got uh two boys.  One is forty two, thirty five and then I got a girl that's forty one.
L:  Oh yeah, I --
R:  And I got [NOISE] one grandchild.  She's ten years old.
L:  Oh [NOISE] yeah, so -- 
R:  W- she's in [NOISE] school.  Yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.  So you probably worry about what she reads.
R:  Oh [MN] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- definitely I -- 'course I worry 'bout what she reads --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And uh --
L:  Uh, I have three boys still at home ages ah eleven, thirteen and fifteen --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and um, we- we're so concerned about the things [NOISE] that they learn in school that we home school.
R:  Oh, well that -- you know what?  [NOISE] I thought of -- I --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- thought about that but of course now, this is my granddaughter so --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I have no [NOISE] control over that.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But now uh, [NOISE] they did have her in a private school and they were very unhappy about the way she was being treated in that private school so they transferred [NOISE] her to another school and you know everything -- ever since she's been treated -- uh transferred to this other school, [NOISE] then everything's gone good for her --
L:  Well, that's g- --
R:  -- but her parents do keep up on everything which I'm proud of.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Thank God for that.  And --
L:  Oh yes.  You have to be so involved nowadays --
R:  Oh yes.
L:  -- and know what's going [NOISE] on.
R:  Oh yes.  And of course --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they watch -- you know they make sure about what she [NOISE] watches on TV --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [NOISE] and naturally she's into the computer, you know.  I [NOISE] mean I wasn't born in the computer age but she is and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- have starting that they watch 'bout what she's, you know, getting on that computer and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, yeah.  You know you'd -- you know you got to be very careful --
L:  Yeah -- yeah.
R:  -- because -- 
L:  I think the teachers in schools nowadays they don't like having parents be so involved.
R:  Well, you know --
L:  I think --
R:  I think that's right.
L:  I -- I -- yeah.  I think they want to be let alone and do what they want to do and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- parents are -- are -- this day and age are becoming [NOISE] more involved and I don't think they like it one [NOISE] bit.
R:  Well, I don't think they [NOISE] like it either but I think the parents --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- should be involved because uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, some of 'em -- I think some of 'em seem like they --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- just don't care --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and uh -- and I -- you know of course when I -- mine [NOISE] was going to school of course I was involved with all three of 'em --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know.  Of [NOISE] course it wasn't as [NOISE] bad back then as it is now but you know what I'm saying?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I made sure that they was reading the right thing and [NOISE] I just got involved with everything.  I was in the PTA and everything.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And ah --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- you know, 'cause you got to be.
L:  Oh yes. [NOISE] 
R:  I mean, nowadays I mean you know, 'cause these kids they get -- they learn everything --
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  -- that's bad and evil.  They can definitely read the wrong things.
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] 
R:  They get these things in their mind and go out and do things that they [NOISE] should not do --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so I say to --
L:  Well, there's so many children [NOISE] out there that aren't supervised --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  -- and that are allowed to read or -- or to watch whatever they want to or -- you know there's little kids that their parents take them to R rated [MN] movies and don't care what they -- they're exposed to.
R:  I won- -- I know, and I think so -- you know some of 'em -- 'cause I see 'em a lotta times -- I just see kids just running wild and they're in the streets --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and everything else and   Where's the parents?  You know?
L:  Yeah -- yeah.
R:  I mean just -- that just -- ooh that kinda gets to me.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That really does you know and -- and ah, so yeah.  I was -- you know I got to be wo- -- you know.  I ain't -- my granddaughter right now. --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- I mean even though she's -- her mother and daddy takes very good care of her --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I still get involved [NOISE] with everything much as I [NOISE] possibly can.
L:  Oh well, that's good.
R:  Oh, yeah and you know uh, when they have Grandparents' Day --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- 'course I'm up there.  I'm wanting to look at -- ah, my granddaughter's named Nicole -- I want to look at this what's she doin', look at that what she's doin' and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I guess she thinks she's got a nosey grandmother but man I just, you know.
L:  Oh, well --
R:  Because all three of my kids, thank God, they've turned out right -- 
L:  Wow.  But --
R:  -- but I stayed with 'em.
L:  Some day she'll [NOISE] realize that you're doing that 'cause you love her so much.
R:  Yeah, I think she will too.  Right now you know, she's ten years old, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but ah, yeah I believe she [NOISE] will and just like my -- my kids when they were coming up -- and 'course they got irritated with me sometimes.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know?  'Cause they thought I'd get in the way and all this that and other but each one of 'em I tell you right now [SIGH] -- you know they thank God for their mother.  That she was there.  She was watching.  She was involved.
L:  Yeah -- yeah.
R:  And uh, I think that's a very [NOISE] good idea because like I -- [MN] like you said you know a [NOISE] lot of kids don't have supervision nowadays --
L:  Oh I know.
R:  -- and a lot of these schools [NOISE] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and a lot of these people uh teachers and stuff, some of 'em don't even care.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Some of 'em do --
L:  Yeah but --
R:  -- and uh --
L:  -- the new Harry Potter book comes out and -- and it's a tradition.  We've read every single one of them together and so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- when the new one comes out then [SIGH] [MN] the one can't take it o- -- take it and go off and read it by themselves.  We still read it together.  We just read one chapter a night and --
R:  Well --
L:  -- [NOISE] we all together reading it so [SIGH] --
R:  -- that's why we've ah -- we've done.  Now, oh I don't go for Harry Potter because --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- my religion, you know they --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they don't uh -- you know they don't approve of it so --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  -- no ah -- I mean I didn't let my kids -- well of course, back then they didn't have Harry Potter --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but ah you know, I talked to my s- -- I only have that one grandchild and I talked to my son and my daughter in law and 'course they -- they feel the same way.  We don't let her read Harry Potter.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And uh, you know it's just uh --
L:  I understand.  Yeah, some people you know don't believe in that but then you know [NOISE] for -- but -- but that's their [NOISE] choice you know.  If they're -- if they think that's a fun thing --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- to do as a family or not, you know.
R:  Yeah -- yeah.
L:  But that -- that's what we should be there for is to decide.
R:  That's right.  And then uh you know, [NOISE] not only that I think that -- [NOISE] not only that the reading --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- materials that we have [NOISE] in our homes.  You know I --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  -- never did have um -- well, I never did have bad reading --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- material in my --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- home.  
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  As long as I was --
L:  Me either.
R:  -- and I still don't.  And --
L:  Me either and my husband's all for that too.  He -- he won't let my kids watch commercials --
R:  No.
L:  -- on TV because you just don't know what they're gonna throw out there --
R:  You don't --
L:  -- for your kids to see or whoever.
R:  -- you don't know.  Now, I used to be bad about watching the news --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- myself but then --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I kinda got away --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- from that because there's so much out there and they tell you how to do everything and --
L:  [NOISE] Oh I know.
R:  -- and oh God you know.  And -- and nowadays you can learn how to m- make bombs and everything --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- from what I hear about books or the computer or --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- and whatever.
L:  You can find out anything.
R:  Yeah --
L:  [NOISE]  
R:  -- so, you know I have to be -- you --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- have to be careful I think --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- you have to even though you're real strict.  And ya know I'm not real strict but I mean, you know.  I don't consider myself real strict, I just consider myself very watchful --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- about what my kids do and what they don't do and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the same thing with my grandchild and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and you know you got to be because of -- they can get into anything nowadays.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And they can learn anything.
L:  And -- and they're so receptive of any -- any of their peers doing something.  They want to find out what it's all [NOISE] about and -- and --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- to do like they are and be accepted.
R:  Oh yeah.  That's where my granddaughter is right now, you know.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  She just -- she's going through a period right now to where she's -- well she was chubby you know.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  She liked to eat and now she's going through a period where she don't want to eat nothing because she wants to lose --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- weight and have a good little figure you know [LAUGH] --
L:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and this is a ten years old.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know? [LAUGH] God.  
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  Back then -- I mean you know back then they didn't seem -- like they didn't grow up so soon.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But now they're growing up --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- so soon.
L:  Well, you look around.  She's probably got a little friend that's doing that.
R:  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  And so yeah, I'd definitely uh -- I want to be involved about what they read and there're some things that maybe I would agree on but a lot of things I'm not a gonna 'gree on.  That's it.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  An- --
L:  There -- there's a lot of things in there.  They -- they don't have to read [NOISE] what everybody else's reading.  They got lots of good things to choose from that are clean and that don't [NOISE] use you know terrible language or put ideas in their head and stuff --
R:  Oh gosh no.  And I -- yeah.  And uh I think when, you --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- know when I go -- start -- when they school start letting them just read all this kind of stuff out there well then, no.  That's not right --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and I'm just gonna -- I would have to step in and say something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's it.  I mean I cannot agree with some of that stuff.  No.
L:  No.  Me too --
R:  And so --
L:  -- me too.
R:  Yeah I --
L:  I'm with you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But anyway uh [LAUGH] I --
L:  [NOISE] How are you ca- -- where are you from?
R:  I'm Houston, Texas.  Where you from?
L:  Houston, Texas.  Albequerque, New Mexico.
R:  Oh my goodness.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh Lord have mercy. [NOISE]  Is it hot [NOISE] up there? [NOISE] 
L:  Oh it is so hot.  And my air conditioner, I don't know what's wrong with it or if it's just humid or what but it's just hot in the house and it's jus- -- oh, it's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- awful hot.
R:  Well no, my air conditioner is okay, thank God for that, but you know Texas is --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- so hot.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean it's just extremely hot and o' course I don't know lot about other states because I haven't been to other states that [NOISE] much --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but now I know that Houston -- oh God and -- an- -- w- -- not only that we've had some rain.  It gets so hot that we've had a lot of rain the last two or three days.
L:  Oh, I wish it would rain here and just cool it off.
R:  I know.  And I like that too but then after the rain sometimes it gets so hot --
L:  Really?
R:  -- you know.  Yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and we're having a worry down here about these Culet -- +Clute mosquitoes.  They're carrying that uh, carrying that disease --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and then they say if you find dead birds you're supposed to turn 'em in you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- to find out if they d- -- have this disease and stuff like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I'll be dad gummed i- --
