L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I'm Denise.
L:  Hi, my name's Grace.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  Uh, actually I didn't --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- hear the question.  Did you hear it?
R:  It was whether we think that kids in private and public schools should be allowed to read [NOISE] certain books. [NOISE] 
L:  Certain books.  Oh, okay.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I gotcha.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Do you have any opinion on that?
R:  [NOISE] Actually I do.  I think as long as the book doesn't promote drugs, then -- and alcohol, like drinking alcohol -- I think they should be able to read it.  I mean, even really [MN] if the kids read about the [NOISE] -- in books -bout doing drugs and stuff, they're going to realize --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that you know well, "I see in this book that they're doing this and they're getting in trouble.  Well, maybe I shouldn't do it". [NOISE] 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I think anybody -- as long as [NOISE] you want to read it you should be able to read it. [NOISE] You know?
L:  I feel the same way.
R:  [NOISE]  
L:  They just had a [LIPSMACK] -- a big, big deal here [NOISE] in Calla about --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um uh a certain --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- book that was in -- in the library --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and there were some parents that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- didn't feel that it was ah --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- appropriate for young children --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] -- but uh [SIGH] I -- I really didn't see anything wrong with it and, ah, a lot of parents didn't but because it had, um -- it had in there -- the book -- um, the part- the partnership was between I think it was between two women instead of a woman and a man --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that the parents -- some of the parents --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- complained that it should have been pulled from the library --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] at school, and uh I --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- don't think that's right.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, see --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um, my idea on that is [SIGH] "If you want to be with a woman, by all means let you be with that woman as long as you're happy".  I mean [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- y- -- kids have got to be able to experience different things so that --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- when they go out into the world they're not totally like, "Oh my God what is this?" 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You gotta be able to experience and live your life.  You only live once.  I mean, a book is just a book --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know?  It's something to ge- get you -- it's to help you be smarter.  It's not something that's trying to put you down or make you do something bad.
L:  Exactly.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Yep, I am definitely of the -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- same position. [SIGH] Yeah.  I feel -- do you have kids?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Me?  No.
L:  No.
R:  I don't have any kids.
L:  Me neither but if I had kids, I mean, I would definitely have uh them to uh read whatever they think would be appropriate to read ... [LIPSMACK] um --
R:  Yeah.  That's -- that's how kids -- that's how they -- they become their own pe- -- their own person.  
L:  Right.
R:  You've got to explore different things in life to become who you are.  You can't be some -- you cannot be yourself if someone's telling you your whole life that, "I don't want you like --".  Say I was to date a woman, if my parents would not let me talk to my sister because I was dating my sister's -- because I was dating a woman, that would make me feel really bad because, I mean, if my sister sees that I'm with another female, which would [MN] not a big deal and makes me happy -- then happiness is the most important thing in life.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know I don't see why somebody should put somebody down for being with a -- somebody of the same sex or somebody of a different race.  I mean that's what makes the world go round.  You've got to live your life and you've got to learn different things.
L:  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.  I -- I mean there's some [NOISE] um -- oh there's some books I think that in -- fifty years ago they were banned and now they're fine because people's attitudes changed.
R:  Yeah, really.
L:  And I think f- fifty years from now there'll be books that -- that -- that the people won't matter -- it won't ca- -- they won't care, but now they care because they see things a little, like from -- from a point of fear.  They're not used to something, or it's new, it's different and it's here.  You know basically --
R:  That's exactly what it is.  It's not -- they're not liking this, not liking that.  It's they're afraid to introduce their kids to something different, something new.  But parents, what I'm saying, they need to introduce their kids to different stuff because it's better off that you introduce your kids and you help them learn about the things and then they go out on their own and can learn them on their own.  I mean like sex and stuff.  I would rather have my kids -- I would rather have my kids come to me and let me talk to them about that --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- instead of them going out and reading a book or talking to somebody else's parents about sex.  You know?  I mean --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it's -- it's all for education.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You've gotta be educated to live.  I mean it's hard to live without education.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  If you don't know certain things then you're going to be left [NOISE] in the blue.
L:  Yeah.  I hear you.  [LIPSMACK] Is it the public schools that -- that they were wanting to --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- to know of our opinion or is it just any --?
R:  It's the public and the private it said.
L:  Public and private. 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] Ah.  I think [SIGH] private [NOISE] schools the parents have more um influence over what their [NOISE] children -- what their children read 'cause [SIGH] they have more, uh I guess, finances uh --
R:  They have more discipline and sport and stuff.
L:  -- but [MN] I -- I think that a lot of times k- -- people put their kids in -- in private school to -- [NOISE] to um have more control over what it is --
R:  Definitely.
L:  -- that they study --
R:  Yeah, I definitely agree with that.
L:  -- and what they have access to and stuff like that. [SIGH] Like more of a buffer and ah [SIGH] yeah.  I -- I mean if they want -- if -- if the pa- parents want options -- they want options about different um -- edu- educational options, I guess --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- private schools would give them that option.  So that makes [NOISE] sense to me if -- if from a private school --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- point of view if they want to do that.
R:  Yeah, because private schools you pay for.  I mean, you literally pay out of your pocket for your kids to go to that school.  I mean in the public schools you do too but not in the same way as you pay for a private [NOISE] school.  You literally take your money out of your pocket and you know, "Well, here's for -- here this is so my kid can go to this school" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- instead of as those do, "Well, my kid goes to a public school where kids that their parents don't pay right out the pocket, they, you know tax -- it's all your taxes and stuff". [NOISE] 
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  So I would think in private schools they would [MN] they would have um more choi- -- uh, options [NOISE] to limit their -- their um [NOISE] books and things like that 'cause they're paying for it really.
R:  Yeah, I definitely agree.  Private schools is it's all good and fine but in public schools if -- I don't know.  I just -- I don't know.  I've been -- I've been to both private and public school --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- and um when I went to private school we had -- it was a lot more --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- like the books [NOISE] -- when they -- when the school picked the books out they picked them out by [LIPSMACK] cuss words not -- making sure there's no curse words in the book, making sure there's no -- I guess you in -- homosexuality, making sure there was none of that in there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, stuff like that.  That's 'cause a lot of the private schools you know -- there's a lot more discipline in public schools.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's a lot different.  When I went to public school our libraries -- we had tons of stuff in our libraries.  We had about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- women having babies, um let's see [LIPSMACK] ... I mean literally books that shows you that when women were having babies.  Pictures --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- as opposed to a -- a private school.  They wouldn't have something like that because they don't want to expose kids to that but I think kids need to know that kind of stuff.  They need to see that when they're younger because that makes them -- that reflects on them when they get older.  When they look back and they say, "Well, I remember when I was in eighth grade --"
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  "-- and I looked at this book and it was about a woman having a baby and she looked like she was in a lot of pain" and you know [MN] --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I mean just stuff like that --
L:  That's education. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  It -- it reflects on you in the end because I still remember stuff that I read in health -- uh sex education class --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that I know now I'm like, well I re- -- I remember from sex education class that I've got to be responsible and I shouldn't have a baby until I'm really ready and I'm responsible enough to take care of somebody else --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because right now, I tell you what I'm not even [LAUGH] I can just -- I'm just barely doing myself right now.  I'm taking care of myself.  I just got my life back together.  I'm trying to, you know, do me now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] I look back and I think about when I was in school and the books I read and the movies I watched and teachers told me.  I think back to what all that stuff they told me and like, "All right, well you know what?  They were right.  I -- you know, I really got to get myself together and I gotta do good".  As opposed to the private school, when I went there, there was nothing but getting punished for doing this, getting punished for doing that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean, if you said -- if you said how you felt you'd get in trouble for it.  You'd get smacked on the hand with a ruler or something.
L:  Hm.  Yeah that's a --
R:  If you brought a magazine from your house --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to school you'd get in trouble for it.  They would take the magazine away.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Really?
R:  Yeah, I went to a Catholic private school here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] And they were like really strict the nuns and stuff.  They would smack us [MN] like a couple of times -- I brought like [SIGH] I think I brought a teen magazine to school one time and it had a girl in a bikini on the front of the magazine --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I got my magazine +taken away and thrown away. [NOISE] 
L:  Hm.  Now that's cen- -- that's definitely censorship.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Definitely.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean, public school it's fine and dandy to have, you know, a variety of books.  It doesn't -- I don't care what it has in the books.  I mean, as long as it's not literally promoting like, "Oh I want you to go out and have sex -- I want you to go out and do drugs".  I mean nothing like that.  That I completely, completely understand.  I would not want my kid reading a book like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I mean if it's something that somebody was on drugs and it shows how bad their life was and how they got themselves back together, I think that's good for a kid to read that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because they said, "Well look, this person did this and then --"
