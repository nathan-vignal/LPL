R:  [NOISE] Hi, uh my name is Sam. [SIGH]
L:  Hi, I'm Vicky. 
R:  [NOISE] H- --
L:  How are you [NOISE] tonight?
R:  I'm good.
L:  Good. [SIGH] Oh, well --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- censorship huh?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] -at's kind of a tough one. 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Um [SIGH] I think schools should be allowed to do it to a degree.
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE] I mean you know, I'm not [MN] -- some -- some people are like fanatic not letting their kids read Harry Potter but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- Harry Potter's so popular.  [SIGH] I [NOISE] think if our school were [NOISE] to censor and ban it I know a lot of parents that would be upset about that.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.  So are you a parent? 
L:  Yes.
R:  [NOISE] Oh.  Okay.  So how old are --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- your kids?
L:  Six.
R:  Okay.
L:  He is six.
R:  So -- so they're kind of almost --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- bordering -- are they reading now?
L:  Just starting.
R:  Okay.  And as a parent do you think that you know you'd -- you'd let the school decide?  Because I think the question was whether if the -- if the private schools would be allowed to --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know censor what they read.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So do you think you'd be upset if the -- if the school were to decide?
L:  [NOISE] Um [MN] I do. 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I think that um [MN] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know I like my son to show interest in any type of reading.  I mean --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- you know we've gone through and we've read all the Harry Potter books --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and you know -- and [SIGH] I think that you know the p- -- the parents need the decision.  I mean [MN] [NOISE] you hear of schools --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- doing stuff all the time --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  -- but I think that, um, if the parents voice their opinion --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- then --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the school -- school board has to listen to them or they're not going to get voted in again. [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [MN] So do you have children?
R:  [NOISE] Um, no actually.  I'm a student um --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- yeah.  I'm -- I'm a journalism student [NOISE] --
L:  Oh very cool.
R:  -- yeah.  So I mean we -- we've talked about --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- censorship too --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but [SIGH] I mean, I guess in this --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- case, this is a lot --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- more -- I -- I don't know.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I just don't know if -- I mean certain books, if they're [SIGH] -- if okay, say it's for -- if it's like a [MN] private, like you know, religious school --
L:  [NOISE] Yes.
R:  -- and the parents know like -- you know say, you know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- this also goes along with the evolution --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- whether to teach that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- argument you know.  But I think that -- I mean the thing is like some things like --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] I mean there's just so much biological proof that I think some kids -- I mean, they're going to be missing out you know if they learn another way.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] You know the creationism --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- argument?
L:  Yes.
R:  Because I mean even though some people think that, you know well, there's no proof for evolution, it's like whoa, there's so much more proof than there is for creationism.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it's like -- and it's just -- it's just better because it'll teach kids more about the scientific method --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and -- and you know, because you really can't teach, you know, the scientific method when you're dealing with, you know, godly entities so I mean -- I think it -- that'll -- so something like that is important and that would just, [NOISE] I don't know, screw with what kids -- you know how th- kids think about science, you know?
L:  Yes -- yes.
R:  But I mean like with --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- literature [LIPSMACK] I guess [SIGH] I don't know.  I- -- maybe -- maybe if they felt that it was violating their religion --
L:  [SIGH] Yes.
R:  -- I don't know.
L:  I --
R:  Something like that.
L:  I agree too.  I mean if it's a religious school, a private school [SIGH] you know -- obviously, if it's a private school they -- they're entitled to a little bit more leniency than a public school is --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But [SIGH] I think that a -- a public school shouldn't be allowed to censor books that they feel might offend one per cent of the school --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when it may benefit the other ninety nine per cent.
R:  Mhm, yeah -- yeah.
L:  I mean when I was in [SIGH] oh I think I was in junior high, I remember one of my teachers saying that our school at that time had banned um The Catcher In The Rye.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, as a junior high school student I was very curious.  Why?  What was the big deal?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so I made my mom buy me the book.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] And I found nothing wrong with it. [NOISE] 
R:  Mhm. [SIGH] 
L:  [NOISE] I mean yeah, it had a lot of swear words in it but -- [NOISE] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] -- I -- I -- [MN] -- [NOISE] 
R:  I mean what other things don't?  You know?
L:  Exactly. [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean -- [LAUGH] 
L:  Exactly.
R:  Turn on the television and like I mean now -- I mean it's -- it's so interesting now because now [MN] they --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- can say so many more swear words on television any more I -- you know?
L:  [NOISE] Yes -- yes.  And -- and that surprises me.  I mean you know I've heard words on daytime TV that I'm like, "Oh my gosh" you know? [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  I mean [LIPSMACK] -- I mean kids could be at home --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- around that time.  Especially during the summer.
L:  Oh yes.
R:  Yeah and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I don't know.  Even though -- even though I mean y- you can make an argument that you know you can't protect kids from everything --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh. [NOISE] 
R:  -- it's just that, I mean you don't have to like put, I mean, sensitive issues like that in a place where y- you know it will be accessible.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?
L:  Yes.
R:  Especially in public spaces and like public airwaves --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know like television?
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] I agree. [NOISE] 
R:  I don't know.  With -- with books like -- see a lotta times --
L:  [NOISE] [NOISE] 
R:  -- what -- what's being censored is also reflective of you know um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- like --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- like a status --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- quo like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- what the majority thinks.  Like --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I'm sure books like --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- Catcher In The Rye were really controversial --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know thirty --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- years ago when you know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- rebellious --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- kids were, you --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- know just starting to be a problem.
L:  [NOISE] Yes. [NOISE] 
R:  And I'm sure they didn't want --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- any of their --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- kids to read it.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  They thought it --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- was you know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- pulp you know --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know B l- B grade --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know reading but it --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I mean it's really hard to --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- draw the line between --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- art and you know what is --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- offensive, because a lot of times --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- art is supposed to be offensive --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- yeah. [SIGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Has to make you think.
R:  Yeah it -- yeah.
L:  [MN] [NOISE] 
R:  Like -- like um -- I'm in New York and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- w- what uh Giuliani did a -- a couple of years ago --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- was um, he really condemned this --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- one um exhibit [MN] I think that -- I mean this was big news --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- though.  It had like a picture of --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the vir- -- like the Virgin Mary --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and like cow poop or something like that.
L:  Uh-huh -- yes.  Uh-huh.
R:  And so I mean it's like, "Well, this is art you know".  It's -- it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you don't have to go to the gallery --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you know.  You don't have to --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know give the gallery money --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- or anything.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  But I don't know.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I agree.  I think that you know i- if your children are going to learn anything from it, or even as an adult learn [NOISE] anything, it's gonna have to be something that pushes your -- your comfort [NOISE] zone a little bit --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to make you stop and think.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And uh -- 'cause I know people in my church were a little upset that I was reading Harry Potter to my son --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I'm like, "Why?  I grew up reading The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe series you know --"
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  "-- [MN] there is nothing with those, and Harry Potter -- yeah it -- it can be a little dark but [SIGH] you know it makes my son think --"
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  "-- and -- and f- -- [NOISE] and for that matter he learned a little bit more of what is real and what is fantasy".
R:  Mhm.
L:  So you know for -- for a school to say that you know, "That can't be in our school.  We're not -- it's not going to be required reading" [SIGH] well [LIPSMACK] I think that's all up to the individual parents to decide and if you're not comfortable with it then you don't have your child participate if it's that big of a deal.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] 'Cause you don't hear too much about censorship in the schools nowadays any more though.
R:  No.  I don't know -- I don't think so.  I mean --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I remember in my high school we had you know like a banned --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- books week where --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know we'd -- they -- they'd showcase all these books that were once banned and then you know --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know there's like there is --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they'd put a little bookmark in where um they'd -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- explain why it was banned and it's just so horribly you know, stupid to us right now. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I mean [SIGH] I'm sure things that we're censoring right now, I mean -- I don't -- I mean -- I don't know what we're cen- censoring in the schools right now but I mean certain things in the media that we're censoring I'm sure thirty years from now people will say, "I can't believe they you know they don't --"
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  "-- they -- they would censor themselves from something like that."
L:  [NOISE] Exactly. [SIGH] Exactly.  I actually think my little sister ended up reading [SIGH] -- she's twelve years younger -- she ended up reading The Catcher In The Rye in like her Advanced English class --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so you know I mean in -- in twelve years that was the difference between her and I so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know and now she's in college and you know I'm sure there's a difference between her and the next generation of kids.  You know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] I think in today's society [NOISE] you have to allow your children to be exposed to certain things to prepare them for what's really out there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean [MN] that's just my own opinion.  I'm a foster parent and [NOISE] actually I had -- at one point, I had two sixteen year old girls, a nine year old boy and my six year old son so I mean I had all age ranges and -- and I couldn't [NOISE] imagine them being limited any more than they already were in life --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [NOISE] an- and you know -- and the one boy he was, like, so unprepared to be part of the real world and he actually rebelled and -- and refused to go to school because he just didn't like the way they did things --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I'm like, "Well, you know that's all [NOISE] part of life.  You just have to kinda deal with it.  If -- you know if a [inaudible] that's fine but -- but the establishment, you -- you know [NOISE] you have to conform somewhat whether you --"
