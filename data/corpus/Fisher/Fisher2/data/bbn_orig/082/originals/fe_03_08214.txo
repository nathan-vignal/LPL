R:  Hello.
L:  Yes.  Hey.  Hi.  My name's --
R:  Hi.
L:  My name's Philippa.
R:  Hi, Philippa.  My name is Michelle Quinn.
L:  Yes, hi Michelle.
R:  How are you?
L:  [LAUGH] I'm fine.  And you?
R:  Good.  Where are you from, Philippa?
L:  I'm originally from South Africa, but I'm here in New York --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and yourself?
R:  Um, we live in Michigan, Great Rapids, Michigan, which is the west side of the State.
L:  Mhm.  Okay.  Well, I guess the topic is one that um you can relate to, because I think I heard kids in the back.
R:  [LAUGH]  Then please accept my apologies for that --
L:  Not a p- not a problem --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- for me at all.  Um, how old are your kids?
R:  Um, I have two children.  My eldest is eight and a half, he is a boy --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he'll be going into third grade in the fall and then my youngest is six and a half --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- he'll be going into first grade in the fall.
L:  Fair enough.  So, um --
R:  We have a -- a reader and then a -- a sturd- -- a early reader.
L:  Oh, wonderful.
R:  How about yourself, Philippa?  Do you have children also?
L:  I'm married, but no -- no kids as of yet.  I just got married last year --
R:  Oh, congratulations.
L:  Thank you.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And um I -- I did grow up in South Africa and so in a way when they say censorship of what you kids read in school --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- are they saying that um ah saying that kids have to read certain material and -- and are allowed to, in their spare time, read anything else?  Is that what they're saying?
R:  Mhm.  Well, it's interesting the -- the topic that they chose for us to talk on.  Um, our children both attend a private school --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and one of the hot topics last year at our school they removed all of the Harry Potter books --
L:  Really?
R:  -- from our library.
L:  Why?
R:  And -- well, it was greatly debated by the teachers, the other staff and the parents --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, some of the administrators and the staff believed that they present a non Christian view --
L:  Wow.
R:  Well, yeah, and I -- I think you and I are probably thinking on the same terms, that I -- I personally think any time you can get any child to have an interest in any book and exercise language arts --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and increase his or her um reading level --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- ninety percent of the time I'm pretty happy with about any book that my kids can sit down and actually -- will actually read voluntarily.
L:  Is your school a religious school?
R:  Um, it is.  It's con- it's under a general umbrella of Christian --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um a Christian school, however I would say eighty five percent of the children that attend that school are CRC, which is the Christian Reformed Church.
L:  Oh.
R:  We are -- we are not members of the CRC --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- our family is Lutheran --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- so, we don't necessarily fit the typical mould of the tra- traditional family that attends this school, so with that said, our views might be different just from the on -- on most -- most topics of discussion.
L:  Mm.  So, so did they take a school vote of the parents about the books?
R:  They did not.  They [LAUGH] and that was probably one of the reasons why it was a bit controversial, um, it was primarily decided upon by the school board and the administrative folks to take the books out of the library and --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and that wasn't half the problem, um, because anyone can go out and either purchase the book --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or go to the public library and -- and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, f- you know, rent the book --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- so, that wasn't near the problem as the -- just the fact that they were making such a bold statement regarding the book itself.
L:  It's amazing.  I --
R:  I know.
L:  -- you know, look, I understand there would be certain topics that could be off limits, like say they don't want kids reading about like um, how -- you know, ah -- ah contacting ghosts or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, something that a kid might be curious to read --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but um probably you shouldn't be reading, I guess, but um it's like, where's the limit and how far do you take it?
R:  Mhm.  Exactly.
L:  And -- and to be honest, I -- I haven't myself read any of the Harry Potter books --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think it's a good example though I only saw the first movie, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I didn't see anything anti Christian in it.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've read all five books.  I just finished up the most recent one last week --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- while I was on vacation and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in my opinion there's nothing in there that screams out, um, anti Christianity.  I -- I -- I personally have no problem with the books at all.  My son -- ah the reading level for especially the fifth book is -- is higher than the first four --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, for him to tackle that book would be difficult on his own.
L:  He'd have to be a bit older.
R:  Yeah.  A more experienced reader --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and he asks me daily to read chapters out of this book.
L:  Oh really?
R:  Yeah.  So, I'm hoping, you know, that she continues or we can find, stumble across another series of books that will be a little bit closer aligned to his reading ability.  For him, he struggles in language arts, so --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it -- I mean, if he finds an interest in a book there's --
L:  Yeah.  You --
R:  -- very little that I will do to stop him from reading.
L:  I hear you.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And not only that, it's the people who really over exaggerate.  I remember growing up um I -- because we read mostly English books so um I had a book by -- I don't know if you know the author Ednid- Enid Blyton -- who had two characters --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um that were um that one was like a dwarf and the other was just a like a young boy and they -- and they had the boy had adventures and he'd stay over at the -- the dwarf's house --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and because they slept in the same bed at a -- at one point after I'd read it all through my childhood and now was a teenager --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they decided that b- that it was promoting homosexuality, having the two --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- men, males, sleeping in one bed.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they -- and it caused a huge uproar --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I mean it's like, how far do, you know, people take these things?  You know?
R:  Sure.  Now, how old were you when you read that book?
L:  I was -- I was in elementary school, it was that --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- that age group.  I mean, it w- --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it was really something ah um ah, you know, um, yeah, I mean it's for kid- young kids --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- they had pictures and -- and stuff in the books
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um --
R:  So, the likelihood of you saying, "Ooh, this is about gays and homosexuality" is slim to begin with, just because your knowledge base of an alternative lifestyle was limited to begin with?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  And -- and the truth is is that um, look, all these things are out there in the world.  You can keep your kids ex- you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah shut off from it for so -- only so long --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of course you don't want them to see things that they really shouldn't, like pornography --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or anything which actually is -- it's more of a concern, I think, that people should be --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- concerned about on the Internet and the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- kids, what they get on the emails and that's even in -- in the schools, they're still getting emails, I mean SPAM gets through --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think that's more of a problem regarding censorship than keeping books --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- in libraries or what books kids can read in terms of books.
R:  Sure.  And hopefully their --
L:  You know?
R:  -- energies they could, you know, if you had your choice you could redirect their energies toward topics that are of much more concern than whether or not a Harry Potter book should be in a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- p- public or private school library [LAUGH].
L:  And the irony is, all the hoopla around it makes kids sometimes want to read it even more --
R:  Mm.  Exactly.
L:  -- because why are they fussing so much?  Let's see what there is there.
R:  Uh-huh.  Exactly.
L:  So, it defeats the whole purpose, ultimately.
R:  [LAUGH] Exactly.
L:  So, so has the whole thing died down at your school now?
R:  It has.  But now the fifth book has come out in the summer time, so I'm curious to see if it will um ah resurface some time in the fall.  There are one or two particular, ah, teachers at the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- older school, our -- we have two schools, physical buildings, within our school system --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- one school goes from preschool to second grade and the next school goes from third to eighth.  I believe he is a seventh grade teacher and the other teacher's an eighth grade teacher --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and these were the two folks that lead the train um regarding taking the Harry Potter books out of the library.
L:  Oh, gosh.
R:  So, I'll be very interested um to see what happens in the fall.
L:  So, there's no parent committee or something like that where parents' opinions are reflected, or represented?
R:  Well, yeah, the -- the school board does consist of about nine people, of which all are parents that have parents, or excuse me, that have --
L:  Kids.
R:  -- children in the school system --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, but, you know, you bring up a good point.  It does -- certainly does not represent, you know, nine out of two hundred and ninety families that attend the school.
L:  So, those -- those are the parents that actually voted it out?
R:  Well, those are the parents that sit on the school board, you know.  One person might be in charge of finance, another person's in charge of building repair --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- et cetera.  Those are the nine people that discussed at length along with the administration and the teachers and came to the decision to take it out.  It -- it was clearly a -- a small percentage of the school --
L:  Mm.  
R:  But I -- but I'll tell you, I, you know, even if they involved forty or fifty more parents, I don't know if they would get full support to bring those books back in --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- I think it -- it sends a statement, certainly much more so than a couple of books are missing from the library.  The kids are going to get the books, you know, if they really want to read them, they can go anywhere to get them.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that also shows you how it defeats the whole purpose --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of what they're doing.  You can't control what --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- kids are going to read, especially if it's a kids' book.
R:  You're absolutely right.  That's a perfect example right there.
L:  You know, because it's really up to the parents to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to ah guide the kids correctly.  Again, there's only so much they can do in schools, but, you know, kids don't spend all their time in schools.  What time do you -- what time do your kids get out of school?
R:  Um, they start school at eight twenty three and they finish up at three twenty three.
L:  So, it's quite a long day for your kids?
R:  Um, I wish it were a bit longer.  I -- I feel, you know, I'm in the classroom -- both of my children have learning deficits in language arts --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they're very bright and talented in math and science, but I feel that I need to be there to help them along and push them along --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- so I volunteer in both of their classrooms one day a week.
L:  Oh, gosh.  Very nice.
R:  Um -- yeah, and it's fun.  I was not able to do this prior to leaving my job two years ago --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so this has been a real big eye opener for our entire family.
L:  Wow.
R:  But I see how much time they spend in school and I know it's important, especially kids at a younger age, that they have an opportunity for recess and gym and relatively non academic -- things that I would put under the category of non academic --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I cringe to think, "Wow, like" you know, "What can I be doing with this fifteen or twenty minutes, you know, that in my opinion is something that isn't productive?" so I --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- would be thrilled to see maybe even a slightly longer day to get more educational opportunity --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in there.  Um, Jennifer --
L:  J- --
R:  -- Grandhold --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- who is our Governor for the State of Michigan --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just turned down a proposal to turn it in -- turn the school week into a four day --
L:  [MN] --
