L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, my name is Darah. [NOISE] 
R:  What is it?
L:  It's Darah.  Like Sarah, except with a D.
R:  Okay, I'm Melanie.
L:  Nice to meet you, over the phone. [SIGH] I'm actually --
R:  Nice to meet you to.
L:  -- walking outside the store in [inaudible], so if you hear, like, buses [NOISE] and stuff, that's why. [SIGH] 
R:  Oh, okay, you're on your cell phone?
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [NOISE] But, um, in terms of the topic, um, [NOISE] I don't know, I think that [SIGH] [NOISE] -- w- well, the one book that really comes to mind in terms of [SIGH] something that was censored, you know, but now its just so commonly, [NOISE] um, read in [NOISE] schools is Huck Finn. [NOISE] 
R:  Is --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- what is it?  Uh, Huckleberry Finn?
L:  Huck- Huckleberry Finn.  I know that [SIGH] a lot of s- schools, um, chose not to have it on the curriculum because, um, [NOISE] of things like the N word and, [NOISE] um, things like that, and it was kind of like, rather than exposing students [NOISE] to, you know, the -- you know, the raci- outward racism of that time, it was just -- you know, and there was difficulty, like, [SIGH] what [NOISE] would students say if they read it out loud and etcetera, etcetera, so they just chose not to, [NOISE] you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- h- have it in schools, which [SIGH] [NOISE] -- and obviously this wasn't all schools because, you know, for some it's been in the curriculum [NOISE] forever, but, [NOISE] um, [NOISE] I think that's a good case of [NOISE] when [NOISE] -- rather than, like, directly addressing an issue, it's just kind of avoided through censorship with [NOISE] -- which I don't think is really that productive for anyone, [NOISE] but --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I don't know, what do you think? [NOISE] 
R:  I think, like, um -- I think like --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [MN] I -- it should just be made --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- like, I just think that teachers should make decisions on a case be c- case basis. I don't really think --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that, you know, the state, government or, um, certainly not the federal level should be --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- involved in choosing and -- or selecting books.  It just seems like, [SIGH] you know, the schools can make their own decision, they know what their student body is like, and their --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- maturity level and [SIGH] what they can handle and what's appropriate for them.
L:  [SIGH] Do you know, I'm actually kind of unfamiliar with it.  Do you know what the, [SIGH] um, policy is now?  Like, are the states ce- censor certain books, or is that not legal?
R:  You know, I really don't think so.  Not that I'm --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- aware of, but I'm sure --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- if you were a teacher and -- and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you decided -- I mean, you know, there's, like, Bill O'Reilly is talking about some professor in --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- South Carolina all the time and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] uh, you'll get a lot of attention --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- if you were --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- an English teacher and you said, "We're going to read the Joy of Sex" or something --
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  -- obviously you're going to have all the --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- talking heads, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- attention.  So, I mean, I think -- I -- [MN] it just seems like right now that it's just -- there isn't a -- there isn't a policy that I'm --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- aware of, I mean, it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just seems like --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- but then again, on the other h- hand, the -- I haven't heard lately of anyone making anyone [MN] -- making any outlandish type of --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- request, so 
L:  Yeah, [SIGH] I mean, I -- I think censorship, to a certain extent, discredits, like, the parents, the judgment of the parents and the teachers and you -- one would hope that [NOISE] -- you know, and obviously this is a little bit [NOISE] idealistic, but, like, one would hope that [NOISE] parents would be involved [NOISE] in that to actually care [SIGH] [NOISE] [MN] to the point where --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, their voice alone [NOISE] would be, you know, [NOISE] strong enough input where you don't have the state intervening [NOISE] on this sort of thing, but [SIGH] I know that's not always the case. [NOISE] I mean, I'd hate to say, you know, [NOISE] "Well, [NOISE] I don't hear about any problems, so there are none".  But I really -- you know, at this point, it -- doesn't it -- it seems like something, [NOISE] you know, I heard about when I was little, but maybe it's because I'm not, you know, in the loop [NOISE] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- with the educational [LAUGH] system right now.  I don't know. [SIGH] Um, but [NOISE] it just doesn't seem like, [NOISE] you know, the top ten national problem [NOISE] right now, or even --
R:  No, not at all. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- top twenty. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Not at all, it doesn't seem like we've heard too much news about it lately.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  So --
L:  [NOISE] Or even just with censorship in general, I don't think -- I don't know, I don't -- it doesn't seem as though we've had many, you know, big debates on it lately.
R:  Yeah, I agree, I think it's been --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, such a losing battle --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- for people who have tried to --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, whether it's music, I mean --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [MN] the music is really the last one I remember hearing --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- about where they wanted to --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- censor it, 'cause they just lose all the time --
L:  [MN] Right.
R:  -- it not only, you know, just increases the sales and it just gets as much [MN] -- gets it more publicity, so 
L:  Mhm, mhm.  Yeah, I think really, [NOISE] I guess for better or for worse, I just have faith in, like, the people who, [NOISE] [MN] you know, are administering [MN] these [SIGH] [NOISE] syllabi, syllabuses whatever, and [NOISE] I don't -- I don't [NOISE] [SIGH] -- I don't know, I mean, [NOISE] of course if there's like, um -- [SIGH] you know, like [MN] -- another thing, I actually just [NOISE] remember is, like, the problem with, like, biology books.  I know there was [NOISE] some issue with, um, certain, like, conservative Christian schools [NOISE] not wanting [NOISE] to -- there you go [LAUGH] -- not wanting to, [NOISE] um, you know, have books that, like, emphasize the theory [NOISE] of evolution --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [SIGH] um, but I don't know if they were necessarily censored as much as just, like, [LIPSMACK] you know, [NOISE] discouraged or [SIGH] that sort of [NOISE] thing, [NOISE] but --
R:  Right.  
L:  -- [SIGH] in terms of the public school I just -- in public schools I don't see [NOISE] them not teaching the theory of evolution, you know, [LAUGH] in two thousand and three, so [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] I don't know, but just in terms of an example, that's one, but still, [NOISE] you know, however minor, [NOISE] it's still kinda there.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, [SIGH] but again, like, that's not a censorship issue, it's just more of a debate, but, um, I highly doubt it's getting to the point where [NOISE] we're looking for government intervention. [SIGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] So --
R:  It seems that --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- without the government, everything --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- just kind of works itself out how it's supposed to be anyway.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  It seems like --
L:  Y-
R:  -- that causes a bigger backlash.
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] And, you know, I'm not, uh [LAUGH] -- I feel funny saying it, because I -- [MN] you know, I'm not the type of, [SIGH] like, super libertarian who, like, believes in, you know, all things taking care of themselves without any government help, but in this case I really do think that, like, the government really just does not have to get involved.  Like, I don't think we're having these, [NOISE] you know, extremist [NOISE] issues right now, and [NOISE] also I don't feel like it [NOISE] gets to the core of a problem, [NOISE] you know, if there is a teacher [NOISE] or professor teaching, [NOISE] uh, I don't know, the Joy of Sex to fourth graders [NOISE] -- I mean, there are just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- other questions that need to come before, [NOISE] you know, censorship questions.  Like, [NOISE] there is --
R:  Yeah, it seems like the --
L:  -- always deeper problems, you know.
R:  It seems like it could be --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- handled --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- if it's --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- a public school it seems like it could be handled at a community [SIGH] level or a --
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- school level --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  -- rather than --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I think anything beyond that just really isn't necessary.
L:  Right. [NOISE] Yeah, I just -- and then on a private school level, [NOISE] [MN] same thing, really, I mean, [NOISE] [MN] they tend to have --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- more of a, [NOISE] you know --
R:  I guess maybe --
L:  -- parents are h- more heavy handed because they're paying so [LAUGH] much, so 
R:  I guess maybe public universities would have, um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, [MN] they could be a little m- they may --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- be a little more --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um, risky --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- in what kind of literature and stuff --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they choose, but --
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- you know, then again, those are adults that attend --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- universities --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- so it seems like the students themselves, you know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they're able to [SIGH] get the syllabus and know what books are being read and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, they can choose to drop the course or not take the course or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so 
L:  Yeah, I mean, I think that's it. [LAUGH] I, uh -- I feel like it's kind of a non issue [NOISE] at this point. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And th- and when they suggested [NOISE] this as the topic, like, I was like, "Oh, god". [NOISE] You know, it's a hard one, [NOISE] but after talking about it, it really doesn't seem like there's much to argue at this point.  I don't know, [NOISE] you know, if that's going to change, uh, [NOISE] in the future, [NOISE] but --
