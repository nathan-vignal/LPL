R:  Barbara Marino.
L:  Hi.  This is Dawn.  [PAUSE] I guess we talk now?
R:  Yes, I guess so.
L:  Hi.  Is this your first call?
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  Oh.  This is about my third.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah, it's exactly my third.  The first one I forget what the subject was, second one was computer games --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- then I guess we have to talk about censorship today.
R:  Oh.  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  So, um, I don't know, do you have any opinions on the subject?
R:  On the -- you know, the thing is with um, about -- what was it about, um reading materials in -- in private schools or c- or um public schools --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I mean, depending on the material, I mean are they reading porn magazines, or are they just, you know, it all depends.
L:  Right.  I agree with you.  I --
R:  I mean --
L:  Do you have children?
R:  I have children.  And I remember as a kid my parents never putting a censorship on anything, you know, um, n- not even watching TV, I know that television is a lot different --
L:  Yeah.  It -- well, I don't know what your age is, but I --
R:  I'm thirty seven.
L:  Okay.  So, I'm forty five.
R:  Oh, okay.  So, more or less it's about the same thing.
L:  Yeah, back in our days there were things like Bewitched on TV --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- yeah --
R:  And I love Lucy and Dream of Jeannie --
L:  Pretty mild compared to now.
R:  Exactly.  So, you know, I -- I was never censored.  Today maybe I would have to censor my children.  Now w- on reading material, I just don't understand what can be out there that they -- they -- they can get that I -- that should be censored.
L:  Right.  I -- I agree.  Well, it's funny.  My mother in law called me and asked if um if I would mind that she went out and bought all the Harry Potter books.
R:  Oh.
L:  All five of them, hardcover, if --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I have -- I actually have four kids, two are p- --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- two -- well, two are pretty much grown, they're twenty one and eighteen --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- but the little ones that she was talking about were -- are six and eight --
R:  And they don't app- I don't think they understand.
L:  Well, actually, the ironic thing was, she says, "I don't know if you would want Christopher to read it".  I said, "Funny you should mention that, he's actually read all four already in school".
R:  Oh, you're kidding?
L:  No.  And ah he was -- actually, he asked me for the fifth one that came out and at the time I just didn't have extra money --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I said, "No, he reads it in school" and she says, "I find that really odd because I heard a lot ah -- controversy about it" and I said, "I don't think I did".  I mean, it's wizardry --
R:  Yeah, they're --
L:  -- and magic and everything.  It's fantasy.  And I haven't read the books, I've -- I've watched the two movies.
R:  Yeah, so have I.
L:  Right.  Did you read the books?
R:  No.  No, I don't have time to read.  I have a one year old and a three year old.
L:  Yeah, you don't have any time at all.  You're lucky you have time to shower.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I -- and I made a -- a point, I told my mother in law when she gets the books here that I'll try to read it with them, but he's already been through all four of them and they're not censored there at school.  I mean, I remember there was a big thing about The Catcher in the Rye ah --
R:  You know what?  I've always read um J.D. Salinger's books.  I never read The Catcher in the Rye.
L:  I think I did, but honestly I have read so many books in high school, I don't remember. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I remember reading it in high school.  But it's -- it's like you said, how much can they -- how much can they -- they're not going to put anything really bad in -- in the schools.
R:  No, I don't think so.
L:  And I -- I didn't even bat an eye when my son told me he read all four books in school.  He didn't bring them home from the library to read them, they read them in class.
R:  In class.  Isn't that amazing?
L:  Yeah.  So, this is with the teacher's knowledge and everything and ah so I said to her, "Of course, I don't mind if you buy them, thank you very much" you know, because I wasn't going to go out and buy the set.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Like that, you know, for the expense of it, but um, so he's going to read the fifth one, too.
R:  Yeah, see, that's -- that's great.  I -- I just -- ah -- I just can't see what can -- what's so rough -- I don't honestly see anything rough about the -- the book itself or anything like.
L:  Yeah.  Well, it's funny.  When I um, my eight year old is in third grade, going into fourth and I volunteered once a week for library --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and help the kids check out their books because they didn't have a librarian actually --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- so every class they had one of the moms help and it was funny, they were all scrambling, looking for this one book that had swear words in it --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and they couldn't -- they couldn't figure out which kid had it, if it was out or if it was on the shelves lost somewhere.
R:  Oh.
L:  And they were all going crazy for this one book. [LAUGH] And I had to laugh, the other mom and I were talking, I said, "This is funny, they want the book strictly because there's some swear words" and it was mild.  One of the moms said she had read it and it was no big deal, but to them it's like, "Oh my god, I have to have it".
R:  Yeah.  I know.
L:  You know?  I know -- I thought it was funny.
R:  Yeah.  Also, you know, the thing is that some people also get bothered by movies that -- that have, you know, certain languages.  When they are small, yes, because you ch- you don't want them to -- you don't want to show to them that -- that it is in everyday vocabulary.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  But ah when they reach a certain age, ah you --
L:  Well, look -- look at what they're saying on TV shows anyway.  I mean --
R:  Oh yeah.  Yeah.
L:  You know, they're -- they're getting more and more, they're adding words.  I'm more nervous about sexually explicit things than I am of swearing.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.
L:  You know.  I mean there's certain times when, you know, we won't watch things on TV until they're asleep, certain movies unless --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, unless they're --
R:  Well, how about television programs?  I remember one time I was watching Buffy the Vampire and they had a scene with two lesbians.  I was like, "My God, Buffy the Vampire was on during the day".
L:  Right.  See --
R:  You know, that's totally no way.
L:  There's a lot of times I -- I mean I -- we had TNN on ah some station the other day where they were watching something and whatever they were watching was fine, like I said, they're six and eight, they're impressionable but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- what bothered me was the commercials, or the promos for the upcoming cartoon, Striparilla, by -- with Pam Anderson.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I'm like, even the -- the promos are a little racy --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, and that bothers me.  But that would bother me than they are hearing words.  You know what I'm saying?  I --
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  -- just don't want to get -- that to me is extremely adult, whereas the words, you know, they're going to hear them, they hear them --
R:  Yeah, exactly. 
L:  -- they hear them in the school.
R:  So, why -- why forbid them to watch a movie that has it.  [MN] Unfortunately, you know, they're going to go out there either with their friends, they go to store, and if they go to work and they have a little part time job when they're teenagers, you know, it's going to slip off of someone's mouth.
L:  Yeah.
R:  As long as you always make sure you tell them that it doesn't slip out of theirs.
L:  Well, you can go too far.  I know there's some kids still my kids' age who watch no regular TV, they only have rental tapes and in a way they're kind of sheltering them from the world, but then again they're going to have culture shock at some point too.
R:  Yes.
L:  You know, where they go to school and everybody's talking about, let's say, Sponge Bob Square Pants and this one kid says, "I don't know what that is" --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, my mom only lets me watch Sesame Street --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- you know.  And so it's -- it's kind of --
R:  Everything -- I think all extremes are wrong.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, you're right.
R:  You just have to -- if -- it's a balance, you have to balance it and then you just -- I -- ah -- it's -- it -- being a parent and -- it's very difficult when it comes to things like that.
L:  Yeah.  It's hard.  And you don't know how you're going to be with your own.  They're young still --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and but it sounds like you're going to be a little less extreme than either way and that makes sense.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  And they're boys.  So, it's a l- although, you should never ever --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- use a double standard because you never know when it backfires on you.
L:  Yeah.  That's -- well, I have all four boys too, so --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- so I'm -- I'm in the same boat as you, I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I never had girls to worry about and ah I don't know what's --
R:  I don't know.  We were two girls and one boy and pretty much we weren't raised with double sta- my brother used to help my mom clean.  I mean, there was no such thing as, "You're the boy and you don't do anything".  No way.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You have to work.
L:  Well, that's good because now I'm sure he's grown up to be a decent human being.
R:  Well, when he got married and his wife didn't know how to do anything, he said, "Thank you" [LAUGH].
L:  Wow.
R:  You know?
L:  Unbelievable.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, that's pretty good.
R:  Yes.
L:  I think, well, my husband is kind of from sort of the old school a little bit, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so he's helpful himself, but I -- I'm sure he -- when he grew up he thought, you know, guys go to work and women do the cleaning.
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah.
L:  You know, but I -- I think he's breaking out of that and hopefully, well he's -- he's my -- actually my second husband and when he first came over, when I first decided to expose him to my older kids, who were eight and ten at the time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's funny, we had McDonalds and we were sitting around the coffee table in the living room and um they -- my two sons were just about to get up and clean up and he says, "Oh, let your mom do that" and I looked at him, I said, " [inaudible] and I'm going to tell you right now, if that's the way you think, you better just head on out the door" --
R:  No.
L:  -- you know, that's not mom's job.  I'm teaching them that they have to clean up after themselves.
R:  Sure, because what if --
L:  You know --
R:  -- they're in someone else's house.
L:  Right.  Right.  So, yeah I nipped that in the bud right away [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, no, what if they're in someone else's house or, you know, hey, nowadays kids are going away to college --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and what are they going to do?
L:  Yes.  It -- yeah, they have to learn to clean up after themselves, that's it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.  I always -- well, I have kids who are always so well behaved in everyone else's house --
R:  Thank God.
L:  -- but my own.  Yeah, but -- but I want --
R:  I have one that's a very hyper boy.
L:  Is he?  And how is he out?  When you're out?
R:  [MN] Oh, when you're out?
