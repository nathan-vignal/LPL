R:  Hi, this is Donna.
L:  Hi, this is Anna.
R:  Anna, hi.  Glad to meet you.
L:  Hi.  Nice to meet you.  This is the first time I'm doing this.
R:  Me too.  So, we can start new together. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, good [LAUGH].
R:  Great.  So, what is it?  Public and private schools, do they have the right to censorship?
L:  Do they have a right to choose certain books for their students to read?
R:  Ah, okay.
L:  I remember when I was in high school, my teachers gave us certain books we had to read, it was part of the requirement.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think it's okay.
R:  Now, did you go to public or private school?
L:  I went to public school.
R:  To public school.  Mhm.  Yeah.  I went to a Catholic school and we had -- you know, with the nuns it was relatively censored, I'd have to say, I guess.  Um, and they had our recommended reading list and I imagine there is -- there was a pretty careful screening of what wasn't included but, I don't know, I didn't think it was such a bad thing.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, I don't think it was a bad idea either.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm babysitting too at the same time --
R:  Oh [LAUGH]
L:  -- [LAUGH] and the g- and -- and one of the kids touched my alarm clock.
R:  Oh, gee.
L:  I enjoyed the books.  Some of the books I didn't enjoy that my English teacher's had ah -- asked us to read.  Some of them were like I couldn't get through the book.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Their choices on some of the books were like really like I graduated from high school in nineteen seventy nine so, you know the material then was like ah --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- the Lord of the Rings, ah, not the Lord of the Rings, the t- um [LIPSMACK] oh God, I can't even remember, had to do with a private school got -- like got stranded on a desert island.  Oh, my god.  I can't think of the name of the book.
R:  Ah.  Oh --
L:  The Lord of the Flies.
R:  Oh, Lord of the Flies.  I was just going to say, with Piggy and um I remember some of the characters in that --
L:  Right.  I -- I enjoyed that book and then the [inaudible] Romeo and Juliet, things like I -- I couldn't get through it.
R:  Mm  Mhm.
L:  And it's like -- I guess at seventeen you don't want to read about things like that or just the -- the way it was written.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It was like [MN] it was a hard time.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I graduated, I was um-- I'm older than you, I graduated in sixty nine and I'm trying to remember the God, this really taxes my brain to remember some of the things that we had read, but I think a lot of the classics, you know, we started, you know, with the -- the Dickens books and -- and things like that and --
L:  Right. Oh, god.  Bringing back memories now [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah --
L:  L- --
R:  -- a lot of things that I probably on my own might not have read but, you know, I really, you know, I enjoyed it and then some of the things I remember, I think the longest one that I'd read was Gone with the Wind --
L:  Oh, a Tale of Two Cities, oh my god.
R:  Oh, yes.  It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.
L:  Oh I -- I like it, the best of times or the worst of times, it was the worst time for me [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Ah --
R:  Oh.
L:  But you know what, I guess the teachers were trying to make us open our horizons --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so I guess they had to ah censor the material.  I remember when my son was in elementary school.  I'm in New York.
R:  Oh, you're in New York.  Okay.  I'm in Chicago.  Uh-huh.
L:  Okay.  Maybe I -- I remember when this happened.  This is going back into mid eighties and they were trying to bring in -- a book into the schools with um, w- about a -- alternative families, where like the one kid would have a gay mother and gay, yeah, a gay couple would be the two mothers --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and the two fathers, there were -- they were trying to teach children that there are different types of families and all that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the single parents, they have people that, yeah, and the board of education did not let the book in --
R:  Oh, they didn't?  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they -- they didn't let it in.
R:  Mm.
L:  You know, and -- and they really like stood their ground.  I remember the whole big thing over it.  I thought it was, you know, a book --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- can't be that bad, it's a children's book, how bad could it a chi- children's book be?
R:  Yeah.  Oh.
L:  You know, it's not going to go into details and, you know, I -- I wonder how they choose their books, like who's the head of, you know, who decides what books go into our school system?
R:  Yeah.  I'd be interested in the process, because I think it's -- it's so important for -- for children and people of all ages really to be exposed to diversity and to learn about things --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and rather than hear things just in the news or whatever, but I'm --
L:  Right.
R:  -- when I was in school there nothing probably would even be considered in, you know, in that realm at all.  I mean, it was just so um so terribly conservative.  I think the sign of the times and then probably in a Catholic school as well, it made it kind of even more so.
L:  Right.  My cousin went to a Catholic school and her -- it was very strict then.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like I have older cousins and I remember they -- they used to like as adults now they're -- they resent the nuns for like -- my husband went to Catholic school --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and um I laugh about it because my teachers in public school didn't do this, but he goes, "If you didn't remember your prayer right or you didn't remember your assignment", they would pull him by the ear --
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  -- we're like-- they -- they almost lifted it off him one time, they -- that's how hard they yanked him --
R:  Mhm. Oh my --
L:  -- or the ruler, oh, getting smacked on your hands with the ruler.
R:  Oh, yes.  Yes.  The discipline was unbelievable.  Because I remember like kids that would talk in school would get -- the nuns would have masking tape and they would tape up their mouths and, you know, they'd have to --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- spend the day like that, with the masking tape over their mouths and they -- and not even if they said something terrible, but if they just, you know, spoke up when they weren't supposed to, or something like that, so --
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.  It was pretty rigid.
L:  Wow.  So, imagine them picking books.
R:  Oh my god [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Probably just by the title, "No, no, no" --
R:  [LAUGH]  Actually, I'm amazed we read anything other than like lives of the saints or something, you know [LAUGH].
L:  Wow.  So, I wonder how they really go, you know, censorship, should it be allowed now?  I don't believe in censorship because if you think about in history --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and you think about the time with Germany and all that, what Hitler did with the books, he burnt --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- many, many books and I feel we ha- yeah, we're adults, we're people of a free country, we have a right to choose what we want, when we want --
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  -- you know?
R:  Oh, exactly.
L:  Maybe it sounds too radical [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] No, I, and I agree with you because I -- I think of even in the history books that we had when I was growing up, I mean there was so many things I history that I never learned about till I was an adult, like the -- the um encampment, the Japanese camps, you know, in California --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and other -- I never -- we never touched on any of that in school at all, you know it and--
L:  I don't think I -- I know, I think I learned it on ah the History Channel --
R:  Mm.  Mhm.
L:  -- Discovery.  I watch a lot of programs like that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and that's where I learnt -- I said, "Wow, I don't remember that happening" you know, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I -- it wasn't even mentioned--
R:  Mhm.  It --
L:  -- like and I am very surprised.
R:  Oh yeah.  Boy, I bet if we went back and re looked at our history books now, I mean I think we'd realize now that we had more exposure to the world overall, you know, just how --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- one sided and so it was I think not just for the issue of which books to read, but um the way the books were written, the general school texts, you know, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I written, I think that was so one sided and you know it's kind of scary in some ways, you know.
L:  Yeah.  It is.  It is.
R:  Mm.
L:  You know, like I'd like to go into a high school today and see what kind of history they're teaching today our -- to our kids.  My son's out of school --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, he's ah in his twenties now, my son --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so, I wonder what they t- you know, where everything was happening with September eleventh and -- and stuff like that, I wonder what the history books are going to show.
R:  Yeah.  Good question.  It's the same, our kids are all in their twenties too, mid to late twenties, so it's been a while, um, but -- yeah, hopefully everything's been rewritten in a much more open kind of broad minded way, at least to show that --
L:  Yeah.  Well, what they did with the Kennedy papers, like, even though they opened up those files and all that, a lot of those pages are blacked out, you know, --
R:  Mm.  Mhm.
L:  -- there's a lot more to it that they're not saying.  And -- and it's part of our history that -- and they won't even let us read about it, you know, all of it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And there's still unanswered questions I don't think there'll ever be answers to.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  About that.  Because the government censors that.
R:  Yeah.  Because that's -- that is supposed to be -- that's kept quiet, there's no discussion about when that's going to be released ever.
L:  No.
R:  I don't think, is there?
L:  That's one.  Another, I forget what the rest of them are supposed to be released and all -- are you certain -- I know certain documents won't be released until like twenty tw- ah, thirty or something like that.  I'll probably be old and d- you know, old and decrepit, you know, I'll probably be in a nursing home somewhere --
R:  Yeah, I was going to say, "Well, I'll be gone" --
L:  If I'm even alive.
R:  -- those of us -- yeah, yeah, those of us that were alive during the Kennedy era won't be around to find out the, you know, what was really going on.
L:  No.  Well, I -- if the government's sets ah censoring material, imagine what the ah the schools are doing.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  What, you know, what they're allowed to read and what the l- teachers are allowed to teach and what books to choose.  So many books -- now, I babysit for a seven year old --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and um he was in first grade --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he had a reader from ah it was printed in nineteen sixty nine, the book --
R:  Really?
L:  -- which is old for a school book.
R:  That surprises me because I would think that those would be done sort of every few years, at least.  Oh. 
L:  Well, me too.  Or different, you know, like [inaudible] my son had pretty much new books, like -- like readers that he -- like, the books that he had to read in elementary school were nothing I had read when I was like in first, second, third grade.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And like I was surprised his book was so old.  You know, it really surprised me.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  You know, I don't know if the te- teacher decided to choose on that particular reader or the -- or the school, I don't -- I wonder how they choose that.  I wonder if it's the board of education or it's the district itself who chooses the books.
R:  That's a real good question, yeah.  Who establishes parameters and then -- and then what flexibility do the teachers have within that, or is it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- pretty much that -- that someone, whoever that is, comes across and says, "Okay, this is fifth grade and here's the texts that are going to be used and everybody has to go along with it" --
L:  Right.  I -- do they ever change the -- the book of Tale of Two Cities?  Are high school students today still reading the same books that we did when we -- when we were in high school?
R:  Mm.  Yeah.  Good q
