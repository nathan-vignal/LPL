R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Hello.?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name is Casey.
L:  Hi, I'm Lester. 
R:  Hi. [LAUGH] Um, we're just supposed to talk about censorship?
L:  Right.  Something about private schools or som- -- public schools?
R:  Okay.  [LIPSMACK] I've never done this before.  Have you?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay. [LAUGH] Well, I'll let you start then. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Well, it just uh -- talking basically about --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the uh censorship on public schools and what they should um [LIPSMACK] what you think they should uh censor out of education I guess -- public schools. [SIGH] Um.
R:  Well, I -- I know for --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- sure if um [LIPSMACK] they're teaching certain things like about sex education and things like that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um I would definitely wanna know about it beforehand --
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- you know, before they were teaching my kids something like that.  Just so I could understand what it is that they're saying exactly.
L:  Well, they should check and do that.  What about -- what do you feel about uh censorship on religion?
R:  [NOISE] Um [SIGH] [NOISE] hm.  That's a good question. [LAUGH] [NOISE] Let's see. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Well, the fact that they're taking out uh, "One Nation Under God" --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I -- I don't agree with that because I think --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that there can be many --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- forms of [NOISE] god --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- or somebody can just not --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- say it --
L:  [NOISE]  
R:  -- if they --
L:  This is for you [several inaudible words] [NOISE] --
R:  -- don't believe that way --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- but to --
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Yes. [SIGH] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Hello, yes.
R:  H- um --
L:  [NOISE] -- talking [several inaudible words] 
R:  -- did you guys just switch people [LAUGH] or something?
L:  Pardon me?
R:  Did you guys just switch people or something?
L:  Well, you were supposed to be talking to me.  That was my husband.  He answered --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- the phone for me.
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  [COUGH] [NOISE] -- censorship in public schools talking about --
R:  Um, anyways I was just saying about uh, we were talking about censorship --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- in the schools --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and I was talking about --
L:  -- [NOISE] carry on there.
R:  -- how they're doing the thing --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- with the pledge of allegiance --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- and I don't agree with that censorship.
L:  Oh, I don't either.  And they've done away with the prayer too and I don't agree with that either.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  So --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- I just think that if someone disagrees with that they just don't have to say it.
L:  Right.
R:  You know.
L:  That's exactly right.
R:  And um, [NOISE] I guess as far as censorship in the schools goes I -- I also said to him that if they were [NOISE] teaching something about like sex ed- [NOISE] -- sex education or something like that I would want to be [NOISE] told beforehand about what they're teaching the students because --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I've -- I've never been taught this in --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- school but I hear -- I hear that they are teaching them that like it's okay to be gay and you know, ex- explore that whole side, [LAUGH] you know.
L:  W- I've not heard that here in Georgia but uh I know that -- you know I -- I've heard it has happened --
R:  Right and that something --
L:  -- but here in Georgia they have to --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- uh parents --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- have to sign a paper and it tells on -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- on the paper --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, what the --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- class is gonna be and what it --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- consists of.
R:  Mhm.  Well, that's how it was when I was in school.
L:  Right.
R:  But [NOISE] -- and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I just +heard --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and maybe --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- this is just really radical [LAUGH] school districts or something -- I don't know.
L:  Right. 
R:  But I definitely think that kinda stuff should be censored out.
L:  Oh, I know. [NOISE] 
R:  Just, I don't know.  I think they get bombarded with things enough as it is.
L:  True.
R:  They don't [LAUGH] -- they don't need to be helped along in that area at all --
L:  No.
R:  -- as far as I can see.
L:  Not at all.
R:  So.  What do you think about it?
L:  Well, actually you know, here -- here in Georgia the uh [NOISE] parents have to sign a paper --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- before the kids can even have the sex education class.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Here too.
L:  And [NOISE] that's the way I think -- an- it -- and it gives you a paper telling the parents what they're going to have.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So it -- you know it's at the parents' discretion whether or not the child should have it and I think that's the way it should be.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  I agree with that.
L:  [NOISE] Especially in the lower grades [NOISE] anyway like your uh sixth and seventh.
R:  Mhm.  Um.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I don't know, I just -- I don't know what -- what else they want us to talk about as --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- far as censorship goes.
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] I don't know.  This is first time I've had a call so I don't e- --
R:  Oh, me too. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I'm in California. [COUGH] 
L:  Oh, goodness.
R:  So, like I said there's probably the radical end of things over here [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh I bet so.
R:  -- compared to Georgia.
L:  Oh yeah.  [NOISE] Because we've got family that's just moved here from Montana and the way the [NOISE] schools were out there is [COUGH] nothing compared to what it is here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean they just have little bitty classrooms you know.
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, [MN] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the one school where these kids are from, there was a -- one building that housed the kids from kindergarten all the way through twelfth grade. 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  All in one building.  Can you --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- imagine trying to censor that kind of environment?
R:  Well.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  So it's not --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- like that here and I'm very you know grateful for that.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] Huh, this is an interesting thing.  I've never -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- like I said, I've never done this before so [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's neat. [NOISE] 
L:  Well, I don't know where we're supposed to go [NOISE] from here you know.  Like I say you're my first time someone's called so --
R:  Right -- right.  Mine too.
L:  [LIPSMACK] But anyway I guess we're done huh? [MN] 
R:  Well, it said that uh they will tell us when our ten minutes is up.  I think we're supposed to talk for ten minutes.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Wish we could talk about other things. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That would be a lot more interesting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] [COUGH] But 
L:  This is her first time having a call.  She said she didn't know wh- [MN] -- I'm talk -- telling my husband -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- didn't know what we're supposed to talk about 'cause we're done finished talking about the censorship.  [NOISE] 
R:  Do you have any children?
L:  Pardon me.
R:  Do you have any children?
L:  We have seven but they're all grown and got --
R:  Oh wow.
L:  -- we got fourteen grandbabies.
R:  Oh wow.  [LAUGH] 
L:  So that's one thing you know I'm really -- you know, about the censorship with them.
R:  Yeah I think it also said something about um [LIPSMACK] like --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- a certain --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- curriculum.  Are [NOISE] -- do you be- -- do you ah --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- agree with having a certain curriculum in private schools and [NOISE] things like that and ?  I think so.
L:  Well, see I've not had to deal with the -- the school as- -- I mean the private school aspect so I really -- you know, other than when I was a -- a child growing up -n I was in a private school. 
R:  Oh.
L:   So you know I really don't -- and that was many moons ago.
R:  And did -- did they have a special curriculum for you guys as compared to other --
L:  Oh, well I was in a Ca- -- I was in a Catholic boarding school.
R:  [COUGH] Uh-huh.
L:  And so [MN] they didn't teach your sex ed or you know [SIGH] none of that.
R:  Mhm [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Do you think you missed out because of that?
L:  I dunno.  I felt more -- that I had accomplished more by what I was taught [NOISE] there because they taught you uh um, computer typing you know --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- at -- at early age --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so I was really blessed there. [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I don't know.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Um, not being taught the sex education, you know, made it harder as an adult [NOISE] growing up knowing -- you know what you should and what you shouldn't teach your children --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because basically you -- you were going at it you know um, [NOISE] with [MN] no headway on it.  You know?  You didn't know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- your own self.
R:  Right.  You had nothing to base it on.
L:  Exactly.
R:  So  well, when -- when I was in school they didn't really tell us a whole lot.  [MN] In fact they -- I think I had more questions after [LAUGH] the presentations than beforehand. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  So  
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  But um 
L:  Well, I just -- you know, I wished I had of been taught more.  Then it would have made it easier for me as a parent or as a grandparent also.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, to help with my grandchildren.
R:  Right.
L:  The fact as it is now I got eight grandsons and six granddaughters and [NOISE] they just seem like -- the kids today [MN] know so much more than what we did --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when we were their [NOISE] age.
R:  Yes.  Well, I think a lot of that has to do with TV and things like that too.
L:  Oh, true.
R:  Because there's just --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- no censorship as far as --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that goes.  Even on regular [NOISE] you --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- know, [NOISE] broadcasting ah stations.  But [LAUGH] I don't like it because they just keep --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- pushing the envelope further and further and it's to the point where, yeah, it's not comfortable with my kids watching TV without me [MN] you know saying, "You can only watch channel nine and channel ten". [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Well see, here where we're at now [NOISE] um we can um block our TV.
R:  Mm.
L:  I mean we -- you know, only let them you know watch -- when the kids -- the grandkids are here we can put a block where they can't get into certain channels.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] And I like that.
R:  That'd be really good.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  We may have that on ours too but I don't know.
L:  Do you have dish network or -- or -- or um [LIPSMACK] um [LIPSMACK] --
R:  We just have regular cable.
L:  [MN] [SIGH] I don't really know.  Um  [PAUSE] 
R:  We don't have any special equipment or anything like that --
L:  This would be in --
R:  -- just regular.
L:  -- this would be in your remote itself.  It would uh tell -- uh you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- tell you.
R:  Well, we probably do I guess.  Probably do.  Check it out. [NOISE] 
L:  But um --
R:  But I -- I actually um -- [NOISE] I'm married and my husband has two children --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and we have half custody of them so --
L:  Well see, I have five stepchildren plus I have two kids of my -- two daughters of my own --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but our youngest is --
