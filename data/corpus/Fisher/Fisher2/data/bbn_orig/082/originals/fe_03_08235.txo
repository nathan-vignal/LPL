L:  Hi, my name is Gerri.
R:  Hi Gerri.  My name is Florrie and did you get the exact subject?
L:  Ah, yeah, they're talking about um something about censorship in schools for books?
R:  Oh, the books.  Oh, I missed that part because cen- --
L:  Well, I wasn't sure what I heard, tell you the truth [LAUGH].
R:  Well, I think that's what I heard too.  Censorship in schools ah of our children, with books.
L:  Okay.
R:  Censoring the books.
L:  Yeah.  Telling them what to -- what to read and what not to read.
R:  Right.
L:  Well --
R:  Um, and I guess it's ah the assigned books, too.
L:  Yeah.  Of course, I don't know -- some of that censorship can go a little too far.
R:  Yes, they do.
L:  Yeah.  You know but, you know, some books, well, you know, even in the bible there's things that, you know, you could take many different ways --
R:  This is true.
L:  -- you know, they get carried away with a lot of this censorship and -- and they don't want them to ah do the pledge of allegiance and they don't want them to say a prayer and --
R:  And that's so wrong.
L:  -- all this stuff and -- and look -- look what's coming, you know, look what our country is turning into here.
R:  Yes.  And they don't censor the ah -- the people who are ah Satanists and Wiccans and all that.  They can have their assemblies, but the Christians are not allowed to.
L:  I know.
R:  And that's totally wrong.  And ah like clubs who are primarily of another race, you know, black people, or whatever, they can have their clubs, but we can't have an exclusive white club in our schools.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's just ah reverse discrimination in that area, I think --
L:  Yeah.  I agree, you know, and --
R:  You know.  And as for the books, I think censorship should be a very small thing.  I don't think our kids should be exposed to ah real pornography and things like that --
L:  Well, of course not.  You know, of course --
R:  -- and things like that, but ah real language, yes.  I mean, just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in -- in general, if it fits --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's part of the lesson, the subject.
L:  I know.  Some of the -- some of the classic books that were around many years ago -- I don't know how old you are, I'm fifty nine -- but ah --
R:  You're fifty nine?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So am I [LAUGH].
L:  Are you really?
R:  Yeah.  When you going to be sixty?
L:  Oh, not till next May.
R:  Oh, I'm going to turn in August [LAUGH].
L:  Are they -- are they going to get us for talking about something else other than censorship?
R:  No, we have to talk eighty percent of the time on the subject.
L:  Oh, gosh.  And I guess that --
R:  But we have -- we can do that just for a moment.
L:  Oh, okay.  But anyway, yeah, you're going to be sixty in -- what'd you say?  August?
R:  In Aug- at the end of August, yeah.
L:  Oh, bless you [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, I don't mind.
L:  Oh well.
R:  You're only as young as your spirit and my spirit's real young.
L:  That's exactly right and I have --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- I have got --
R:  But our children in -- in this -- in our subject again, ah, in school, if they are censored too much, like they're not taught creationism at all --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but they are taught evolution --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in books.  And that's wrong.
L:  Yeah.  I know.
R:  Ah -- if they teach evolution, they must teach creation as well.
L:  I agree, you know.
R:  You know?
L:  And I -- you know, I -- I don't know, and of course I -- I've -- I don't know what to say about it really, you know, I think that they've just gone too far with this --
R:  I do too.
L:  -- censorship and you know the --
R:  And they have all these little books about ah mommy and mommy are raising me and all this, you know --
L:  Oh yeah.  Now, that's --
R:  And I have two daddies instead of a mommy and a daddy and all this and -- and that is taught to children in school.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And --
L:  Well, I'm glad I don't have any little ones at school --
R:  Me too [LAUGH].
L:  -- at school, or grandchildren.  I don't have any grandchildren either.
R:  Me too.  I'm glad we, you know --
L:  You know, I wish I had a grandchild, but I mean, you know --
R:  You don't have one yet?  We have one, but we haven't even seen her yet [LAUGH].
L:  You haven't seen her yet?
R:  No, she lives too far away.  We've seen pictures.
L:  Oh.
R:  But that's okay.  It'll come in time.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  We don't travel well [LAUGH].
L:  Oh [LAUGH].
R:  You know how that goes?
L:  Yeah.  I know.  Well, it's costly for us to travel because we have a --
R:  Well, it isn't that.  It's just the physical stuff, you know?
L:  I know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I know.
R:  But ah, censorship in -- in and of itself is -- the Constitution says we can't do it and yet it's done all the time, especially when it comes to good things that are censored.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They censor us saying the name of Jesus, they censor ah, you know, the creationism, they censor, you know, ah -- I think much racism is caused by censorship because of the ah -- the people cause this reverse discrimination by putting racism into everything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, making things racial that are not racial at all.
L:  That's -- well, that's true.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, there's too much discrimination out there --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [inaudible] but, you know, I -- [inaudible] looks at everybody now and, you know, the color, race and [several inaudible words] and I don't know [several inaudible words] far more peacefully.
R:  You're cutting out a little bit.
L:  Oh [several inaudible words] is that a little better?
R:  No.
L:  All right, then.  I'll switch phones.
R:  Okay.
L:  [SIGH] All right, any better?
R:  Yes.  I can hear you now.
L:  You can hear me now?
R:  I can hear you no- --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- can you hear me now?
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  Why don't you hurry [inaudible] north, I can hear you now.
L:  Okay.  Well, shucks --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- I was going to go out on the back deck because it'll be a little cooler --
R:  I'm sorry.
L:  -- it is so hot.
R:  Oh.  Where are you?
L:  I'm in North Carolina.
R:  Oh, we're in Texas.  It's hot here too.
L:  Oh, my God.  You're probably hotter than I am.
R:  No, it hasn't even hit a hundred yet.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  It's -- it's pretty nice today, actually.
L:  Well, we're in the eighties, but it's a very humid eighty.
R:  Oh.  Yeah, that'll do it, the humidity.
L:  Well, they're going to get us for getting off the subject.
R:  Well, you know, all the schoolbooks I think in the nation are chosen in Texas, believe it or not.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  There's a big, you know, this is where it's held and ah up to a certain year they did a great job till suddenly this -- it came into being that we have to teach all these things that are not good and are not wholesome and are not according to the Bible.  All those things must be taught and you're not allowed to say anything against them, but you're not allowed to teach anything good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It seems that way to me.
L:  Well --
R:  And it all started when they banned prayer.
L:  Yeah.  I know.  And the teachers -- I don't know, they can't even seem to discipline anymore.
R:  No, they're not allowed to.
L:  They're not allowed to.  They're not allowed to touch a kid.
R:  No.  Not at all.
L:  And then they wonder why they turn out so bad.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I -- I don't know.  I don't know what the --
R:  You know, just from -- you -- you and I -- our generation too, our children's generation is a whole different world --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because we worked all our lives to get where we are and then our children are taught by society and in school that, you know, you get out and you just -- you're supposed to be where Mom and Dad are after thirty years of work.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Uh-huh.  Well --
R:  [MN] --
L:  -- that's good if you can even get them to work anymore.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's true.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You can even get them to --
L:  You know, I don't know how it is in Texas, but out here you can't hardly find anybody that's worth -- worth their salt to work.
R:  Isn't that amazing?
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You got all jobs galore and people hollering they can't find a job and --
R:  But they won't take --
L:  -- they don't want to work --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, they want the pay day, but they don't want to work for it.
R:  And they want to stop at the top and sit behind a desk and tell people what to do.
L:  Yeah.  I know.
R:  Ah --
L:  Okay, back to censorship.
R:  Okay.
L:  Okay.
R:  And then there's censorship ah -- well, in schools.  That's the main thing we're talking about and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I just think they're censoring the wrong things.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're censoring all good and they're putting the emphasis on all the bad.
L:  Well, why don't they do some censoring on -- on movies?
R:  I don't know.
L:  I don't know either.  That's where they need some censoring, they're getting totally --
R:  Oh yes, they do.
L:  -- carried away with the -- with the language, the F word every other sentence, it seems --
R:  Yes, they do.  And in music, too, and they play the music in the schools --
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, that horrible music that I mean talks about killing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and murder and mayhem.
L:  The rap.  I think -- I guess it's rap and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and some other kind of music, you know --
R:  And the kids are going around with those things stuck in their ears listening to that all day --
L:  Yeah.  And they let them play those, right?
R:  Yes, they do.  And we couldn't chew gum. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  That's right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You're right.  We could not chew gum.
R:  No.
L:  You were sent to the principal if you chewed gum.
R:  We would never have thought to rebel like these kids, like these young boys they picked up yesterday that were-- had this cache of guns and everything --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they were going to go kill people.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Because they were ah teased in school.  Well, I was teased in school, I -- I just cried.  I didn't go think of wanting to kill anyone.
L:  Yeah.  I know.  Well, kids are teased at school everyday, but know, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, they get teased and then the -- the next thing you know, they're -- they're ganging up on, they're bringing guns or knives or whatever --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it turns into a major big deal.
R:  And it is a strange thing, you know, this ah locking up of guns and, no guns in school.  Ah, we grew up with guns all over the place, we never touched them because it just wasn't a thing you did.
L:  You didn't do it, I know.
R:  Just never did.  Nobody worried about it.
L:  They don't censor that. [LAUGH]
R:  No, no they don't.
L:  You know?
R:  Well, they -- they do have a lot -- a lot of schools have ah metal detectors, don't let them bring in guns and things --
L:  I know, it's --
R:  -- which is -- which is good, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- how did it get to this?
L:  That's -- that's sad though, that they have to resort to that.
R:  It really is.
L:  You know?  But I think -- I think if they did some more censoring on the music, the lyrics --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  -- and -- and in the theaters --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the movies, I mean, adults aren't even, you know, very comfortable with -- I mean, sure, we're --
R:  Well, no, I'm not --
L:  -- adults --
R:  -- they call it adult, but I don't call it that [LAUGH].
L:  You know?  It's just every -- just about every movie you see has either got sex, a lot of violence --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I can almost deal with the violence --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- you know, I can almost feel it with the book, because you know it's fake, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but the lovemaking and the -- and the language, every other word, I mean, good God in Heaven, you know --
R:  And that's what the children are looking for.
L:  -- and that's what the kids are growing up with and the -- and they let them in to see this at -- at a very young age.
R:  Yes, they do.  And they even have that stuff in the schools.
L:  Yeah.  So, that's where they need to get the censorship going.
R:  I think you're right.
L:  Right.
R:  And the books about mommy and mommy and daddy and daddy and --
L:  Well, I question that too.
R:  -- you know, teaching them that -- that's just fine and it really isn't just fine.
L:  No.  I know.
R:  You know?
L:  I don't know.  How many more minutes have we got left?  I was looking at the clock a minute ago.
R:  Oh, I don't know.  I haven't even looked.  I just got back from doing some mystery shopping [LAUGH] rest --
L:  Oh, you did a mystery shop, huh?
R:  Yeah, I did two of them, no I did
