L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  My name's Pam.
R:  Hello, my name is Jasmine.  How are you doing?
L:  Fine.  Where are you calling from?
R:  Ohio.
L:  Oh.  I'm from St Louis.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And you participate in this group too?
L:  Yeah.
R:  How long have you been doing that?
L:  Um, this is I think my ah second call and I signed up about two and a half weeks ago.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.  How many --
R:  Yeah.  It's a good thing to work -- before you know it, the money starts rolling in.
L:  Yeah.  I know [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]  So --
L:  It seems like I'm always missing those, so I'm glad I got this one.
R:  Oh, that's a good thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, what do you think about censor- censoring books in the school?  Is that what it's about?
L:  Yes.  That -- yes, I believe that's what she said, if we felt that public or private schools had the right to um censor books and um I don't believe in censorship, I feel that ah that's really a parent's job to determine what's appropriate or not appropriate and um I feel that all books should be made available to everybody.  I don't think a book can really ah -- I feel you already believe something one way or the other and a book doesn't really necessarily n- duly influence you.
R:  Exactly.  I feel the same way.  I feel there should be no censorship at all --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because once they start doing that it'll be like the Nazis burning the books, like they did back then.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I just think it's kind of sad that somebody else feels they need to decide what's okay and not okay for me to read --
R:  Right.  I mean, this is what our country was based on, freedom --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that means, you know, the same thing.  And it, like, even though the trashy magazines, like Playboy and that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, if you don't like it, don't read it.
L:  That's right.  Yeah.  
R:  But don't stop the other people because they want to read it.
L:  Yeah.  That's how I feel.  We've kind of had some issues with that at our school about Harry Potter um teachers -- some teachers not wanting to, you know, ah not wanting to read it and other teachers wanting to read it and parents getting upset about that, that they're reading it in the classroom and that it's on like a list for children to read and ah --
R:  Well, what's wrong with Harry Potter?
L:  They feel that it's teaching them witchcraft [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, get real.
L:  Yeah, they feel that it's just ah -- it's all about witches and the occult and um teaches them about things like that.
R:  Well, if they would read the book, they would find out that that's not what it's all about.
L:  No, it's, you know, it's a fantasy book.  It's just the same thing as the Tolkien books that used to be about or, um, even Merlin the -- Merlin from King Arthur --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, he was a magician.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  It's just a storybook and it's actually just about this little boy --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know.  And the --
L:  Oh, he's the --
R:  -- adventures that he goes through --
L:  Yeah.  That's exactly right, yeah.  But, yeah, I just -- I just don't believe you should censor any books, I don't think you should censor music or -- even though some of it's pretty bad -- [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes.  Just don't listen to it.
L:  I wouldn't --
R:  I mean, I don't like certain music, so what do I do?  I don't listen to it.
L:  Right.  I don't buy their music, I don't support their concerts and I don't listen to the radio station they're played on and I buy what I like.
R:  Right.  And then I -- oh, you're right.  It should be up to the parents --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and if the parents, you know, are saying, "Well, we don't like this" well, then they ought to be paying closer attention to what their children are reading.
L:  That's right.  Do you think it should be different for like a private school, that they should be allowed to choose more --
R:  No, I don't -- I don't think so.
L:  Okay.
R:  You know, you -- freedom is freedom of --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- being able to read ah -- the same with the private school, you know, they should not censor what a child should read and shouldn't read.
L:  I agree.  Yeah, they should all be -- I know in our high school, um, my kids' high school they ah have um there was some debate too about allowing certain books in the library and the librarian was a real strong supporter for a no censorship, which was good.  I don't remember what the books were, but she felt that they should all be made available to the students and that they could even learn something from reading books that might not be appropriate.
R:  Right.  You know.  And um my son went to a Catholic school --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and they didn't censor anything that -- and I know that they have that left behind series books --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and there was an article in the Catholic newspaper that they don't condone the kids reading those books, but they didn't say that they shouldn't rea-, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they can't read 'em.
L:  Right.  
R:  Which --
L:  Yeah.  They [inaudible] it might not be an appropriate choice, but they're allowed to choose it if they want too.
R:  Right.  And I thought that was good, that they said that they didn't condone, but yet they didn't say, "Don't read it" --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it was just their opinion.
L:  Because I -- I -- I kind of thought the private schools might be a little more strict about what they allow being their -- you know, in their schools and what they allow the kids to read.  That's kind of good that they don't.
R:  Right.  Which I was happy to see that because my son has already graduated, but still, you know, I get the newspaper and I was happy to hear about that --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because I don't think that your --the Catholic schools should stop kids from reading anything or any private school.
L:  Mm.  Right.  Right.  That's true.  Hm.  Well --
R:  So, now, we've still got to talk for a little bit longer.
L:  I think so.  So, how did you hear about the survey?
R:  Um, through the Internet.
L:  Oh.  
R:  Because I do s- you know, other little things, I'm a mystery shopper, so I go to --
L:  Oh, so am I.
R:  [LAUGH] So and I don't know that um mystery shopping inc's got to do that ah oh, how could I say it?  I'm on one -- a couple of those um groups that they send you email --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and this was the one of the groups that they send me email to let me know about the University of Pennsylvania [NOISE] oh dear, hold on. [NOISE] There.  I moved to a different room.
L:  You have a lot of dogs.
R:  Yeah.  I have six dogs [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Yeah.  And the mailman just came, so of course they all went crazy.
L:  Yeah.  You've got to yell at the mailman.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I heard about it through ah um a web ah freelance B.Y.U., they send me a lot of things about surveys and mystery shopping.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it's called freelance by you?
L:  Uh-huh.  It's -- it's --

R:  Oh, that's neat to see.
L:  Yeah.  And she's the one who ah -- that the person who owns that one's the one who referred me to this program.  She had, you know, ran a thing about it.
R:  So, it's freelance B.Y.U. dotcom?
L:  Mhm. 
R:  Yeah.  I ought to check that out.
L:  Yeah.  You should.
R:  Yeah, this was just through a newsgroup that --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I'm in Yahoo, one of the Yahoo newsgroups --
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and ah they said to try it, so I said, "Okay, I'll try it" you know and this is I think my third or fourth phone call --
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  Yeah.  And I -- and I just got a check last week for the -- the first two phone calls I did.
L:  Well, that was pretty quick then.
R:  Yeah.  So, I was happy to see that and now I'm [inaudible] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- twenty dollars is twenty dollars is the way I look at it --
L:  It's always nice to get those in the mail, isn't it?
R:  It sure is because even --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- the little ones like I do --
L:  Five or six bucks for some surveys or some -- yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Because I do ah feedback plus, which is another survey, they pay you five dollars every time you do a survey --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and so that adds up too.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  You know.  So, and I do --
L:  You know, there -- I was surprised at how many there were out there for things like this.
R:  Yes.  Me too.  And I'm like, "Well, I could talk, I'm a big talker, I can talk about certain things" you know --
L:  Yeah.  I know, it's like, I'm -- I'll talk to anybody, so [LAUGH] just tell them to call me [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  And it's nice to hear from other people in different, you know, areas of the State and what their opinion is --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- on certain things.
L:  That's right.  That's right.
R:  You know?
L:  Well, it was sure nice talking to you.
R:  Well, you too.  I think we have to keep on talking till they tell us not to talk.
L:  Yeah.  Until it'll just -- it'll just stop, so um, but it was nice talking to you and have fun up there in, what'd you say, Ohio?
R:  Yeah.  Ohio.  I'm in Mansfield, Ohio, which is an hour from Columbus.
L:  Oh, okay.  O- --
R:  And an hour from Cleveland, so I'm like right in the middle, so I could reach, you know, if I wanted to hit any big tow- -- big city I could reach it, but it's more like in the country where I'm at.  And I like it just fine because we came from Chicago, so I'm used to a big city and I was glad to come to a smaller city, not so many people, not so many crimes and things like that.  You there? [PAUSE] Hello?  [PAUSE] Hello? [PAUSE] [NOISE]
