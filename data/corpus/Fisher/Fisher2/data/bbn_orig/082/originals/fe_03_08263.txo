L:  Hi, this is Jason.
R:  Hi Jason, this is Melanie.
L:  Hi Melanie, how're you doing?
R:  Good.  How are you?
L:  [NOISE] Pretty good.  [NOISE] 
R:  Um, I guess the topic is do you think they should -- I guess censorship.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, well, yeah.  Something 'bout -- to do with, uh, certain books I guess that kids can read in school; is that correct?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.  [NOISE] What's -- what's your ideas on that?  [NOISE] 
R:  Well, um, I don't know.  I'm -- I'm a pretty liberal person in the way of reading.  I mean, we -- I read --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- The Color Purple at, like, eight or nine --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- which probably I shouldn't have I guess but --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I mean, my parents were very, very liberal in what I read.  We -- they would jus let us loose in the library for hours at a time and [COUGH] we would come out with bags of books, you know --
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  -- we were voracious readers.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  So -- so, I mean, I -- I don't know, when I was a kid we read To Kill a Mocking Bird, you know, in class.
L:  Mm.
R:  [COUGH] Well, now in our school that's not, you know, that's not acceptable reading for our, you know, our -- our elementary kids.
L:  Right.
R:  And I'm, like, well it was good enough for us.  It's a great piece of literature.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] You know.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I'm trying to, you know, I'm trying to think back to what, I mean, I -- I don't know when you graduated but I graduated in eighty nine.  I'm trying to think of when, uh, you know, what we were reading mostly back in, you know, in grade school days and stuff.  I do -- I do remember To Kill a Mocking Bird, I do remember that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, um, but I'm trying to think back further than that,  I -- man I c- -- I can't remember that much of what I read, honestly.  I just, like, I think reading for me wasn't as [LIPSMACK] uh, yeah --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- I didn't read as much as I think I should have.  And I wasn't as interested in it, you know, when I was --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- younger.
R:  -- gosh, that's all I did was read.
L:  Really?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yes.
L:  You would have got along great with -- you would have got al- -- uh, got along great with my wife 'cause that's all she did too when she was young.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  I -- I'm -- we -- from -- I mean, my mom taught me to read at four and I was reading fluently at four.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  And ever since then, you know, I just -- just constantly have a book in my hand pretty much.  And I just can't imagine life without books.  But -- but yeah, I mean --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- another book that I notice that is very unacceptable these days is, um --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I don't know if you ever read Uncle Tom's Cabin?
L:  You know, I never have but I've heard about it.
R:  Excellent book.
L:  Mhm.
R:  A lot of the Mark Twain works, you know, were excellent, excellent books.  He's an excellent author.  I mean, I just love him.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, those aren't unacceptable reading in classes either only because of the fact that they have, um, what's considered now to be racial slurs in them.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Well, my point is with that is, you know, I'm mot sure if you ever read, um, oh, well, [several inaudible words] by Mark Twain, but --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- that's part of the time period --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, that -- that the people were living in [COUGH] that stuff was acceptable back then.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It doesn't mean that it's right now 'cause times --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- have changed --
L:  Yeah, true.
R:  -- but, well, and -- and for example, um, we live in a pretty highly curric- -- Christian community --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and Mark Twain wrote a book called, um, Letters From the Earth --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- where basically, like, Adam and Eve +were on earth and -- and, like Satan's thrown down from Heaven, you know.
L:  Right.  Uh-huh.
R:  Well, you know what, he ends up throwing back to Gabrielle in Heaven saying, you know, "These -- these human creatures are really crazy and they do all these weird things" and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you know, it's really kind of funny if it's -- satire is what -- basically what it is.
L:  Oh.
R:  But that book is, like, very, very highly cricica- criticized in this area because it's not -- it's, like, viewed as being [LIPSMACK] anti religious.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  And that -- that wasn't his point.  
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  But -- so, what --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- around here we have a lot -- it's very conservative around the area that we live in.
L:  Are you, like, in the south?  Or ...
R:  No.  We're in, um, [COUGH] near Missouri.
L:  Oh, okay, Missouri then huh.  Okay.
R:  Might as well be in the Bible belt down south 'cause --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I grew up on the north west area, which is just the opposite, Oregon --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, uh, yeah, it's, like, maybe one percent go to the church basically.  [LAUGH]
R:  Really.
L:  Yeah.  It's really unchurched, uh, community.  And, uh, it just, for me personally, what I've seen and I've just seen a lotta -- lots of people, I mean, I just -- and a lotta kids getting in trouble.  I mean, a lot of kids; drugs, I mean, you name it man, this is problems, big problems in that state.  So, um, I'm not saying that, you know, that everyone has to go to church and that scenario but from my personal experience, um, I think what I saw -- saw a lot of kids falling through just reading that was just -- it -- I don't know, it just seemed like it was -- I guess how it sparked their imagination.  But it made them kinda want more of maybe the dark realm or, you know, the dark side of, yeah, I don't know how to explain it.  Uh, just things that weren't -- wer- -- that pulled 'em into trouble in other words.  Like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they started, you know --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- uh, experimenting with witchcraft and all kinds of other stuff, and it's, like, man, that stuff's not good.  You know, I stay away from that, you know and everything, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, uh, that's my experience what I've seen and, um, and just today, like, you know, uh, everything's pretty much open.  It seems like even for grade schoolers and, you know, as far as sexuality and all that stuff.  And I'm a little on the conservative side honestly.  But, uh, I don't know if the kids should be reading 'bout, uh, you know, all kinds of ex- explicit sexual stuff and, you know, um, whether it's homosexuality or even -- even in fornication.  Anyone -- a- anything like that to me I think is just -- what it does is rouse them -- want -- want -- it just gives them more curiosity -- be part -- to be sexual in that way, you know, even --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- at a young age.  And, uh, I've seen a lot.  I mean, just; 'cause I work with kids a lot so [LIPSMACK] I've seen a lot of kids get pulled into all kinds of pornography and all kinds of stuff just 'cause they were s- -- they had that curiosity and stuff and then you see kids having sexual addictions and by that time they're aged --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, fourteen, fifteen years old.  And it's, like -- it's, like, wow!  It's crazy.
R:  Well, that's what, you know, we're seeing a lot of that around here.  I mean --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I've got -- I don't want to tell you too much, but I've got a niece that's --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- that's twelve --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and we found out 'bout six months ago some pretty terrible things about th- -- and I -- I'm a psych major.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  That's my -- that's my thing. 
L:  Wow!
R:  And I'm, like, where is she getting -- you know, where do the- -- where -- but everything in the media's so highly centralized these days --
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  -- you know, you got girls -- the biggest thing where I work at; University of Missouri is that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- girls walk round with these low, low rider pants --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and like a thong sticking up out of 'em.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  And I'm, like, I don't want to see that.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I know.
R:  You know.  And what kind of attention is that drawing?
L:  Oh, I know.  It's terrible.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's terrible.  And -- 
R:  It's just disgusting.
L:  Yeah.  I know.  I -- you know, I like -- I'd like to see kids wear something different these days.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, leave more to the imagination than just let it all hang out. 
L:  Yeah.  I wo- -- 
R:  You know what I'm saying?
L:  Exactly.  I mean, I -- I think there's the -- I think the morality's been a little bit better than it -- than it has been just 'cause it -- I [inaudible] see the downgrade in our society in so many ways.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Especially with out kids.  You know, I mean it's -- it seems there's always -- there's always a section, a group --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  or whatever --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and, uh, as far as adults, they're going to be that way 'cause that's just the way it is.  But it's -- it's sad when you see a large, large number of our kids, you know, anywhere from age, [SIGH] you know, eight to twenty that are involved in all kinds of stuff that I never even thought [several inaudible words] [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] involved.  You know what I'm saying?  So, it's crazy and all, like, uh, I work with a lot of inner city kids and, um, the drugs is really bad in some areas and stuff --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but just the stuff they're involved in is terrible so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, uh --
R:  Well, and it seems like to me any more, especially in our area, wi- -- just like that meth[?] -- supposedly the meth capital of the US, you know --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and we have a big what I guess methro[?] would run into our [LAUGH] state --
L:  Really?
R:  -- which is just fabulous.  But, yeah, you know, we live in a very small town and there's like a -- a cross of [several inaudible words] or a [LIPSMACK] a railway track so much, it's, like, this little big meth section in the town, you know.
L:  Mm.
R:  And these people have kids that live there.  You know --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it's just -- it's just ridiculous.  And I'm just waiting for 'em to blow themselves and half of our town off the map.
L:  Oh, no.  That is -- 
R:  By making a, you know, a wrong move some night.
L:  That is -- that is -- that is, you know, it's crazy.  It's always seems to be in the small towns that it -- that's, uh, really --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- thriving, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause I know, like, [several inaudible words] sol- -- small towns, they currently live in Colorado but this was small towns in Colorado that are having the same problems.  And, uh, I grew up in a really small town, like, only about two thousand people in, uh, Oregon, it's called Estacada.  [NOISE] and, uh, it had about, you know, round two thousand or so people and they -- and it's funny because see in Oreg- -- in Colorado they always tell you the, um, you know, you going through the city, they show you, like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the elevation --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, how high you are and stuff you know.  But in Oregon they, you know, give you the population.  Well the population never changed.  Every year they're supposed to update it and they'd update and nothing ever changed.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  Well --
L:  So, go ahead, I'm sorry.
R:  Le- let me -- let me tell you how many -- you think you lived in a small town.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  We have two hundred and forty seven people in our town,
L:  Wow!  That's -- that's a lot -- that's really --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- small.  [LAUGH] Okay, I'm not -- I guess I didn't grow up that small a town.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  I mean, that's pretty --
L:  That's funny.
R:  Yeah.  Well, it -- it's very, very tiny here.  I mean, we -- we have a seed and a feed, a coke machine and then my little greenhouse business.  I think the coke machine does the most business.
L:  Oh, that's hilarious.  
R:  Yeah.  It -- it's pretty darned tiny.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  We don't have anything here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's funny.
R:  But then I think the kids are bored is -- is a lot of the problem that we have.  They have nothing to do.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, you're right.
R:  And then with the parents being gone all day, you know, working or whatever else --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's the only problem I see any more, is that there's not enough time spent with --
L:  The kids, yeah.
R:  -- you know, yeah.
L:  Mhm.  I see that too.
R:  I grew -- when I grew up -- when I was real little, that was, like, the norm --
L:  Mm.
R:  [NOISE] -- you know, moms did not work --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in our area. 
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  You know, dads went to work but moms didn't.  They stayed home.  And that's why I think I learned to read so early.
L:  Mhm.
R:  'Cause I had a lot of interaction with my parents.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah.  Well, [several inaudible words] your parents, you know, you don't get raised by the -- the schools or --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- by day care.  Whereas it is -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- today where y- you can get all kinds of different influences and --
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE] 
L:  -- from who or what or, you know, I mean, children in -- at young, young ages experience sometimes trauma type stuff that they --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- should never have to go through, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, and I don't know like -- I'm not saying their care's terrible or really bad and it should not -- shouldn't be out there, no.  But I'm just saying a lot of stuff has happened in day care that shouldn't happen, you know, but it just has.  It's sad that way, you know. 
R:  And it's no matter how good your day care is; it's never the same as mom and dad.
L:  No.
R:  I mean, we've been through that.  We have a nine year old that went to day care and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, it -- it was a horrible guilt factor for us but it was, like, well at that point we had to work and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, it just -- it's -- it's never the same as what -- no matter how much they love 'em.
L:  Mm.
R:  It's not ever the same as mom and dad, you know.
L:  Yeah.  That's -- that's a so true.  Um --
