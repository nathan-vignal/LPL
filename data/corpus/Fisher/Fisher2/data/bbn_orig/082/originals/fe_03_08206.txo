L:  Hello.
R:  Yes.
L:  This is Kathleen [inaudible] from Columbia, Maryland.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And you are?
R:  Donna Williams from Philadelphia.
L:  Okay.  Um, the topic.  Did you get it clearly?
R:  No, I couldn't hardly -- I couldn't hear it.
L:  They -- I think that it said something about censorship for books in schools, do you think that school children should be um --
R:  Using what?
L:  Censorship.
R:  Using -- is that -- yeah --
L:  Books.  About certain books.
R:  Selling books?
L:  Certain books.
R:  Who?
L:  They were talking about censorship.
R:  Right.
L:  Okay.  And I think they were talking about books.  They didn't say -- state specifically which books, but um I think they were asking whether books should be censored.
R:  What, the books that the school -- that belongs to the school, or the -- the school, the books that you purchase?  Like, notebooks?
L:  Well, I guess it -- um, I'm not sure.
R:  I think --
L:  Well, what do you think about censorship in general for the schools?
R:  I couldn't quite understand ah what she was saying.
L:  Yeah.  That was true.  But I -- I --
R:  The question --
L:  Pardon?
R:  I couldn't quite understand the question.
L:  Yeah.
R:  All I heard was censorship.
L:  Yes.  But I heard the other part about schools, so I know it's --
R:  I heard schools and then books and then that's all I could hear [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Well, let's see what we can do with that.
R:  Well, let's just try to put it together.  Censorship --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- schools --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- books.
L:  Books.  Now, they didn't specify which books, but I -- I think it's -- the question was whether um schools should be allowed to censor certain books --
R:  To send certain types of books?
L:  Yeah.  Censor certain um types of books, maybe topics [PAUSE] -- and I think that ah some books ah probably um explicit sex and violence books, for example, they probably wouldn't want that for -- to be exposed to the school children [PAUSE] --
R:  It shouldn't be, you said?
L:  Yes.  Well, at least, that's my opinion.  Certain specific explicit sexual and violent content books that --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- you know --
R:  -- should be banished from schools, or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  Well, I agree with that a hundred percent because the more they read on violence and the more they read on ah sex, the more ah -- ah encourages them to become participants --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you want the ah -- a good sys- some good citizens and you want ah good Americans and um you want a good society and you wanna kind of practise a good morals and I guess reading these books and purchasing these books ah doesn't even promote that.  It --
L:  Well, that's true.  There are a lot of books that does not promote that sort of thing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and um one of the reasons I say that they -- they should censor them, because we have enough books that have very good content that teach us really great moral values --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that ah we don't have to go scraping the bottom of the barrel --
R:  No, we don't, definitely don't --
L:  You know?
R:  -- so, they should be a little more um ah conscientious of ah what type of books that they are purchasing, or whatever, for the school system.
L:  Mhm.
R:  The types of books, um, and what it -- and the fact, they should be aware of the fact that it would -- the impact it would have on people in general --
L:  Right.
R:  -- as a society, um, we -- there is so much evil going on and we don't want to promote evil --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we want to try to promote good, good ah --
L:  Right.
R:  -- good ethics, good principles, good values, ah, we should maybe try to ah give books more on love and relationships and people and how to treat respect, virtues, good qualities, as opposed to um the violence and the ah -- the gun shooting and et cetera --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and the sex um, it's all right -- maybe create more books on family um people g- you know, family um, maybe that could try to help our society become more family oriented --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we have a lot of people, unwed mothers, teenage pregnancies, you get the -- maybe get books focusing mainly on the family to try to promote families, that's try to strengthen society, um, have a stronger community, stronger people and --
L:  Well, that -- that's true.  But on the other hand, um, you know, there's a danger in t- in -- in censoring anything --
R:  Yes.  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, you -- you -- because -- because then you have all the -- the whole controversy of what are we censoring and what -- what are the -- the standards, what are the rules?  And what are you going to allow and not allow?
R:  That's right.
L:  And um, you know, that could lead to a whole nother debate --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because you -- you really, you -- you want them to get a broad um picture, you don't want to just narrow it into just religion or -- or just, you know, goody goody things in fairy tales, but at the same time um, you know, who -- who's going to -- to establish what they should read?  Because, you know, the whole thing -- like for example the -- the question of sex education -- some people think that that should not be taught in schools at all, you know, any book -- because some of the books that -- that they have in schools right now -- and I know some of them are very inappropriate for the children -- 
R:  Well, um, well, sometimes if ah children read them and with proper guidance at home perhaps they can get a better understand of that.  Um, when I was talking about ah -- ah -- what I was talking about in terms of ah reading the books to good -- have a good world --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- well, you want to have a comfortable world to live in at least and -- and reading these books on violence, they -- they promote their attitudes and, you know, encourage them to do this and that, but at the same -- you want a safe environment and you want a healthy environment and I think a lot of times what you read can have an affect on what you d- can predict as to what you do.
L:  Oh, I agree totally.
R:  But I'm not trying to say that you want a good good society, but you want a comfortable place.
L:  Oh, I -- that's right.  No, I -- I do understand what you're saying.
R:  Mm.  I --
L:  You know.
R:  -- I -- I -- I'm aware of the fact that, you know, well, you -- I'm going to focus a lot on good because I am a preacher's wife and I go to church and so I'm going to -- that -- that's -- but I try to, you know, get a realistic idea from everybody, but, you know, you want the place where you live to be comfortable, comfortable and peaceable at least.
L:  Yes.
R:  People can do little things --
L:  And tolerant?
R:  Hm?
L:  Tolerant.
R:  I didn't hear --
L:  I said, tolerant of good moral values.
R:  Right.  Right.  Right.
L:  Not just tolerant --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because you've got to draw the line somewhere.
R:  Right.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, you can have fun -- can you hold on for a minute?
L:  Sure.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] I don't think you're allowed to take calls.  Are you allowed to take calls?  Hello?
R:  Yeah, but um, you know, you -- you, right, you want to be comfortable where you are.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, ah, you don't want to feel like you can't relax where you are, you can't ah be at peace where you are, um --
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  I know the world is not going to be perfect, but if it's comfortable, it's okay.  You want to be comfortable.  You want to ah bring it back to where the time where you can go to talk to your neighbor if your child does something wrong.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Today you go to approach somebody --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- today they are going to want to --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- beat you up.
L:  [LAUGH] You're right.  Without risking life or limb, you know.  But that -- the question comes out, um, who, you know, who's going to contribute to what's setting the -- these values, the -- the censorship?  How much should be left up to the schools and how much ah -- ah to the parents?
R:  It has to be a balance between the parents and the school.
L:  So, you think that the parents should have some say in what books are allowed in the school?
R:  Yeah, they should.  They should be involved to that extent where they should, but we don't have much -- well, in Philadelphia you don't have a lot -- ah many schools and in fact the public school system, about thirty percent parental involvement, that's overall, the whole public --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- school.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You don't have that much.
L:  Well, I think we need a lot more parental involvement because the children do spend quite a bit of time in school and you need to know what is -- what is -- what is being taught there.  You want to know what -- what values are being promoted at the schools.
R:  Well, in Philadelphia, the parent vo- involvement is not a high +significant number.  I -- this -- this -- this parents they just ah basically leave the children to do whatever they want to do, make their own decisions, make their own choices and they're not quite geared in the direction that they need to go.
L:  Yeah.  Because they -- they need to be directed --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they need, you know --
R:  Sometimes we --
L:  -- they need some direction.
R:  -- l- allow them to be adults at an early age --
L:  Before they're ready.
R:  Right.  And what happens, the +maturation is not there --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and they end up doing a lot of things that ah they shouldn't really do, but they say, "Oh, my child" he's a boy, they say, "Oh, he's a man" but if -- if a child's a teenager, he -- that doesn't mean
