R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  How are you?
L:  I'm fine.  How are you?
R:  I'm good, thank you.  I couldn't make exactly the topic.  Could you hear it clearly?
L:  Um, yes.
R:  [several inaudible words] --
L:  Yeah, they're um --
R:  You --
L:  -- they're saying that ah they want to know whether or not they feel the government has the right to um censor the -- what books our kids are reading the schools.
R:  Oh.  Okay.  Oh, well, well, that is interesting [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, it is.  Yeah, I remember when Catcher in the Rye or whatever, you know, that was like when I was in school, that was like the -- the book that was like being pulled out of the libraries and stuff, so --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So --
R:  I can't really recall any um book that I knew of being censored, even though I'm sure that they -- there were some, but none that came to my attention, but I guess I -- it would make sense on a certain level, I mean we wouldn't want just anything going into the school system, being fed to the children, but then of course they will always be available to them anyway.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  But, yeah, um, -- um, well, you probably wouldn't remember it because it's probably already pulled though.
R:  [LAUGH] Right [LAUGH].
L:  It was censored, you wouldn't know, huh.
R:  Well, exactly [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  I don't know, it's hard to say, though what, you know, because like nowadays I do all that um like a gay relationship stuff and --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and religion and stuff that they're, you know, so I don't know, I'm really for it or against it, but it's --
R:  I know bec- you know, it's kind of tricky.  It's a very thin line because, you know, at one point you do want to protect them from certain things, but then they do need to be aware of what's going on out there.
L:  Yeah, I know it.
R:  You know?  But at the same time, maybe like um I don't know, I can't think of how that would be classified, but you know how they have those CDs ah with parental advisory --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- labels on them, you know, I'm sure they have books that fall under, oh, I think they fall under erotica, if I've -- if I recall correctly, I'm thinking about in my bookstore at [inaudible], you know how they have labels for every section --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and of course those shouldn't be -- I don't think they should be allowed --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- into the schools.
L:  Well, yeah, because they're just, you know, makes the kids start having ah feelings of, you know, adult --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- sexual whatever and it happens --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- early enough as it is, I think.
R:  Yes.
L:  You know, TV and stuff.
R:  Unfortunately.  Unfortunately --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I agree.  I think so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- too.
L:  Yeah, I think so.  So, it's --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- I don't know, it -- so, do you have any kids?
R:  No, actually I don't.
L:  You don't?
R:  But I -- and I -- I don't even have any nieces or nephews, I have a bunch of cousins, but [LAUGH] --
L:  Really?
R:  -- other than that -- yes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I haven't really had to face the issue on a personal level --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- as of yet --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I can imagine some chi- ah parents do.  What about yourself?
L:  Um, well, I don't have any myself except I'm now with a -- in a relationship where he has two, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so I guess I'm kind of just now coming into, you know, immediate family type syndrome.
R:  Yes.  Yes.
L:  So, yeah.  Just a -- it's kind of an interesting topic, I guess, sort of -- because I never really thought about it too much.
R:  I know, isn't that [LAUGH] something like hmm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  So, I don't know.  Yeah.  But, then again, you've got to kind of look at it like, you know, if you don't give the kids the right to -- to look at everything and how can they really be able to be making their own educated decisions about --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- you know --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- what they're thinking and feeling, so ...
R:  Exactly.  That's -- I guess that's -- I would not want to have to be the one on that panel to decide [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  And exac- what is --
R:  You know --
L:  -- what needs to be censored and what doesn't.
R:  Exactly.  That, no.
L:  [MN]
R:  I -- but I do believe that some things do need to be um [LIPSMACK] we need -- we do need a filter in there, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't know because it has a potential of getting out of hand.
L:  Yeah.  It does.
R:  E- you know --
L:  But at the same time, I mean, you know, if a kid's looking to make and learn about something, you know, then --
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  -- but I don't know.  H- --
R:  And then they're exposed to so much anyway on the television, the radio, my goodness, the books [MN] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the books are probably behind times [LAUGH].
L:  Probably, actually, it's been, you know --
R:  You know?
L:  -- h- --
R:  Yeah, especially with the way --
L:  Probably are.
R:  -- you know, the rate that things are just unfolding in society today, it's like, "Come on, who has time to write books on what happened yesterday when all this is going on today?"
L:  Yeah, heck.  I mean, actually, look at it like, yeah, you can censor all the books you guys want because probably they're not going to, you know, be like a written media too much anymore anyways --
R:  I know.
L:  -- probably all going to be done on, you know, plug it into the film or the computer or whatever and --
R:  Exactly.  The Internet.  Now that's --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- the thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] That there is the ticket.  They really need to be focusing on that, I think.
L:  Yeah, they should.  Yeah, they absolutely should.
R:  More so.
L:  I mean, heck, you can just about, you know, view anything you want on the Internet, so ...
R:  I know.  I mean, but it was -- I'm sure when a person conceived of it first thought of it, it's a great idea -- it still is a great idea -- but Good Lord, it opens up so many doors, Pandora's Box.
L:  Oh, it totally does.  And then it just brings up the issue of, you know, who's to say -- a lot of people don't even think about it, but who's to say that what you're viewing is actually right or is actually, you know, you know, a true type --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- [inaudible].  You know?
R:  Exactly.
L:  A lot of people I think are probably blindly, you know, just believing, they've seen it on the web, you know, or on a page --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they think it's right --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they think it's true or whatever.  They believe it.
R:  And, you know, we should really know better in today's society, it's just like the news.  They will report one thing at eight o'clock and by ten PM [LAUGH] you know, they're retracting what they said.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  So, it's just -- I don't know, I g- and like maybe it all comes down to bottom line is that homefront --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, the guidance and the structure that's set up in the home and perhaps the parents will just have to really just let your children know that you're going to have to take everything with a grain of salt, do your own investigations and, you know, feel free to go out there and explore, read up on this, that and the other, but always think about just how much sense does it really make and how does it benefit everybody involved?  Or, I don't know, there's just so much out there, you just have to be so careful.
L:  Yeah.  That's true.  I mean you can only protect them --
R:  So --
L:  -- so much from --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- you know -- yeah, you got to let them kind of spread their wings and -- and learn things for themselves and, you know, yeah, it's kind of interesting, that's for sure.
R:  And then there's a fine line with that too because you don't want to protect them too much that they don't know anything that when they do get out there, you know, they're just -- they're just like babes, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just to- yeah.
L:  Yep.  Yep.
R:  Still unprepared.  So, you know, you just expose them to too much and then you can protect them from too much.  It's whew, I don't know.  Good luck to you [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  With your two new step kids.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know because parents I -- you guys have such a hard job.
L:  Oh heck yeah.  It's not easy, that's for sure.
R:  Hm.
L:  It's um -- it sure is different, especially coming right into it, you know, when they're -- when you're not actually then their -- when they're not your kids, because it's just a --
R:  Right.
L:  -- oh it's -- it's interesting to be, you know, to be sure, um --
R:  Oh, I can imagine.  I can imagine.
L:  I think society has changed so much over the years, you know, just ah -- like the respect issue and --
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah.  Degenerisation or whatever it's called.  It's just like, you know, society and as a whole it's just like --
R:  A lot of the um people in my family are educators --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, they're all involved in the educ- educational system in one form or the other, one capacity or the other and it's so funny when we all get together and they hear my aunts and my cousins speak on it and they just say they all are in agreement that it's a whole new breed [LAUGH] quote unquote --
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  -- of children out there.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And it's just, you know, it is different, it is very different.
L:  And you think --
R:  Different is good but I don't n- you know, I don't know about this kind of different.
L:  Yeah.  It's kind of like the whole Adam and Eve thing, the whole degenerisation, you know, it's like they say that when, you know, when Adam and Eve were first, you know, when God put them here they were like pure and they, you know, they -- they were -- had the capability of creating an offspring that was perfect --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because they were created perfect in every way, um, physically and um mentally, everything, you know, they were just -- they were -- they were pure and then when they sinned, or whatever, they took the -- the apple, it made them impure and it made them um, what was it just -- it just made them unable to create perfect offspring anymore --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and so from that it's just gotten worse and worse because as they keep going down the line that's what -- anyways, that's how it was explained to me -- it's kind of like degenerisation, it just like, when you have two -- two things that are perfect --
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  -- they could have created perfect, but then when they didn't and couldn't --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it just keeps getting worse and worse and more and more as you're going down the line, it just kind of, you know, descending [inaudible] --
R:  Right.
L:  You know, it's just like man having, I don't know, I -- I don't understand why we -- why we all have to just keep trying to find more and more ways to hurt each other --
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, it's kind of weird.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But -- but I guess, ah, you know, I don't know, maybe that's why they try to censor things and maybe it's actually not a good thing.  Because maybe --
R:  Right.  That's true.
L:  Yeah.  I mean --
R:  That's true --
L:  -- maybe ...  Who's really to say?  But --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- but then again, if we didn't have some of the censorship, we could be having more like little Hitlers or something running around.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know, maybe some being cultivated or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- anyway.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  There's no telling.
L:  So -- yeah.
R:  Only time will reveal.
L:  Uh-huh.  Little Hitlers or ah --
R:  Well --
L:  -- let me see, little um, what -- what women do we have in our society that -- or in our past history -- that were pretty bad?  I can't think of any really right now, but --
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  I know --
R:  -- what is that la
