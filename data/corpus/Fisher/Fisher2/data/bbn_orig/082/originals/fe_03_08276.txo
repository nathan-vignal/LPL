R:  Hi, I'm Steve.
L:  Hi, I'm Cindy.
R:  Cindy, hi.  First time here.
L:  Yeah, I've never done this before.
R:  Yeah, same here [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Just figure this out.
L:  So, they were wondering if public or private schools have the right to do what?
R:  To, I think, uh, force children to read a specific list of books --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- is what I heard.
L:  Okay.  
R:  Um, hm.  You know, I think that's what I had to go through.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't recall as a student ever having a choice.
L:  Yeah, I don't think I ever did do.  It was the next assigned book and you read it and --
R:  Yeah, I -- unless, um, perhaps they're thinking of should teacher have the right to form their own curriculum versus it being dictated top down.
L:  Yeah, well I -- I don't really know if it's -- I could see maybe if they're doing something controversial but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for the most part I [MN] --
R:  It -- it seems like I guess, um, the topic being censorship it would have to be more like a prohibited set --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R: -- rather than a --
L:  Maybe one that some parents wouldn't want their kids reading.
R:  Right.
L:  But, um, I -- I would think that if -- I don't know, if my kids were told that they had to read a certain book that I didn't think was appropriate or something, I would like to think that maybe there'd be another option for 'em.
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It comes difficult of course if -- if, uh, the whole -- they can't participate with the rest of the class of course.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're off on their own --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, uh, ostracized probably [LAUGH] from the rest of the kids.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, that -- that would be pretty bad.
R:  But, I --
L:  But, um --
R:  -- I don't ever recall being in class like one example I recall was when, um, Do the Right Thing came out, the movie --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- the Spike Lee movie.  I was taking --
L:  Yeah, I don't think I've seen that one but --
R:  It was pretty hotly contested and, um, I was in a rhetoric class at the time and we wound up, um, watching that movie and, you know, it didn't count as a book of course but, um, watching because it was controversial and banned in some cities --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- and I guess that, um, the process was about trying to understand why someone might want to ban it.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, um, it's -- it's like, uh, I guess exposure or confronting censorship as a teaching device about censorship.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I remember trying -- in my, um, school, uh, some -- some of the students were reading The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- which isn't -- have you ever read that?
R:  No, I -- I've only heard of it.
L:  Yeah, it's not that awful.  There's not really -- I mean, there -- there are worst books and worst movies out especially now but the teach- some teachers wouldn't let the kids read it and get credit for it by, you know, doing the projects or writing a report on it or whatever and some kids wanted to read that book but, yeah, it's -- you know.
R:  [MN]
L:  I still don't really know what was so bad about the book.
R:  Yeah, I guess they can -- they could, uh, fake their argument by claiming that it has no literary merit --
L:  Yeah, yeah, of course.
R:  -- as opposed to thinking that the ideas are simply too confrontational or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- controversial.  Uh, lots of ways I guess to -- to get there.  It would come down to proving your reasons why you wouldn't let the kids read the book.
L:  Right.
R:  But, uh, yeah it -- it just sounds like a -- a strange prompting.  I -- maybe I haven't been following the news enough to know from what this arises.
L:  Yeah, yeah, me too.  And it's maybe the Harry Potter stuff.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- you know, I have a friend who doesn't let her kids read it.  She's a very religious girl and she doesn't want her kids to read Harry Potter and wear the Harry Potter stuff because it kinda goes against God and you know, trusting God and all this stuff and, you know, wizardry and witchcraft is something she doesn't want her kids to know anything about or, you know, be involved with.
R:  I see.
L:  But, um, yeah, maybe the question comes from the Harry Potter stuff coming out.
R:  Yeah, I mean that's -- and that's -- that's an example of plenty of parents endorsing those books because it makes kids want to read.
L:  Oh, exactly.  Yes.
R:  So, to think that if it's also laced with difficult content, that's an additional quandary.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Because then you have to force kids earlier on to -- to see that some books are okay and some aren't.
L:  Yes, and they might start to question, yes well if parts of this book aren't, you know, aren't good then what about [inaudible].
R:  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  Maybe that's what she's afraid her kids are gonna do.  Who knows [LAUGH].
R:  Well, and also there's the, uh, cookie jar problem of, um, of the books that are forbidden basically become the desired reading list.
L:  Oh, of course, yes [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] And the Bible would go in the opposite direction in that case.
L:  Yes, yes.  You're pushing that on your kids, you want them to read it and yeah, believe -- yeah.
R:  They'll go somewhere else fast.
L:  [LAUGH] Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH] It's like the whole movie rating system seems to work that way.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  My kids are younger and they're much more interested in the PG thirteen movies than anything that's G or PG.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  If it's PG thirteen, I want to see it.
R:  Must be something in there that I'm gonna learn from.
L:  Yeah, something interesting in there that my Mum doesn't want me to see.
R:  [LAUGH] I recall -- I mean, there was plenty of R rated movies that -- that my Dad used to keep us from watching that he used -- he loved watching them and they were -- they were basically horror movies.
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  And it took us a long time to figure out what exactly was his criteria for filtering these things.  It didn't seem like it was necessarily sex.  Um, you know the -- the R rating was perhaps too broad to understand what was guiding him.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  A lot of times I think it was just, um, what he had heard about a movie, he decided he didn't want us to see but he liked to see.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  So, we had to come back later in life and rent those movies.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Sometimes realizing we hadn't missed anything.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Wasn't allowed to see a lot of the, um, like Porkies and --
R:  Exactly, that's --
L:  -- those types of movies.
R:  That was a -- that was a specific entry on the list.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].  Yeah --
R:  So, I went over to my friend's house to watch it [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, they were afraid I was gonna go off and do that stuff.  Who knows?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, boy.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, it sounds like, uh, we must have been about the right age at the same time.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  What -- what year did you graduate from high school?
R:  Nineteen eighty nine.
L:  Oh, I was eighty seven.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Close enough.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, and then the censorship thing, there wasn't a whole lot of it when we were growing up.  Now, you know, have you ever tried to buy one of the, um, the tapes that has alert on there.  The parental advisory.
R:  Oh, like an album, um ...?
L:  Yeah, like a cassette or a CD.
R:  You know, I think -- I think I've bought them but I've never been carded or anything like that.
L:  Yeah, you -- you actually get carded.  Maybe it's because I have my kids with me or -- or something.  They -- they card me -- I've been carded a couple of times and it's just kinda funny.  I don't remember ever having to do that when I was younger.
R:  I -- no, I mean, -- I -- I think that -- and I also can't figure out well how much lang- is it language or themes that it takes to get one of those stickers because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so many -- so many albums you can't understand the lyrics anyway.
L:  Exactly unless they --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- have it written down you can't figure out what they're saying.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  All you have to do is change the writing part and sing the same thing and it would probably be okay.
R:  Right.  Yeah, I mean as far as learning from that, I -- I always thought that, um -- well, I mean, I've -- I've been buying music all my life.  It's still -- I don't think that I ever learned anything vicious or elicit by way of a song.
L:  Oh, exactly.  Yeah.  I -- definitely.
R:  So, it's -- it's very surprising that they've carried it over there and of course, you know, you can turn on the radio usually and hear the songs anyway --
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  -- if they're -- they're much desired.  But, yeah, that's -- that's a problem too where I guess some artists strive to get those labels put on their albums.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And others are -- are effectively damned by it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- depending on what their target market is.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I think if your target market is probably the seventeen to twenty three year old crowd, having one of those parental warnings is probably gonna help you.
R:  Yes.  Especially when they create the illusion that there's two versions of an album.
L:  Oh, yeah. yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Dude, I got the bad one.
R:  Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH] Yes.
R:  It becomes twice as valuable.
L:  I got carded buying my CD [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  Yeah.  And I mean in -- in none of this -- none of this do I ever see where the person being protected wants protection.
L:  Exactly.  Yeah.
R:  So, I -- I mean you're a parent I gather.  You mention --
L:  Yes, yes.
R:  -- you have kids.  I'm not yet but, um, I would imagine that you -- you've established some, uh, timing where there's things you don't want them to know yet.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  There's definitely things and, you know, just if something's on TV at the right -- you know, and they're walking by just as [NOISE] something's being said, then I got do some explaining that I don't really want to have to do.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that I don't think they'd normally even ask about it but, uh, as far as school is concerned, though I don't think -- they're only in first and third grade so nothing's really come up yet where I think censorship [NOISE] is a good or bad thing for them.  Maybe when they get to be in high school or junior high I'll think differently but --
R:  Yeah.  I don't -- I don't think -- I don't recall curriculum allowing one to wonder through books really until maybe about fifth or ...
