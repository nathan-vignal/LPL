R:  Hello, my name's Kevin.
L:  Hi, Kevin.  My name is Myra Laney.  How are you?
R:  Hi, Myra how are you?
L:  Good.
R:  Where -- where are you from?
L:  I am from Mathew[?], South Carolina.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  How ou- --
L:  And you?
R:  Uh, New Jersey.  Princeton.
L:  Oh, now this is -- this'll be nice because this is a northern and southern perspective on this.
R:  This is true.  This is true.  Although I must tell you [LAUGH] I was just in North Carolina a couple of days ago.
L:  Oh, what part?
R:  I went -- well, I was driving from New Jersey to Florida and I went, um, all the way from North Carolina and I stayed in Lumberton.
L:  Okay.
R:  It's --
L:  It's a little bit -- I'm near the Charlotte area.
R:  Okay.  So, you're -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you're -- you're, uh, west of where I was.
L:  Mhm.  And censorship is the big, um, facet of public education and private education here.
R:  Really?
L:  There's a lot of concerns about literature, um, that is brought to public schools and the private schools too.  Um, it's always a hot topic of debate in this area.  Do you -- I teach in a public school.  I teach at All Torry[?] elementary.  And we haven't had any issues of censorship come up there this year, but we did at Mathew before.  And it's --
R:  That's interesting.
L:  -- very interesting.  Do you have a public school background?  Do you have children?
R:  Well, I -- I have three children
L:  -- in -- or private --
R:  I have three children.  And, um, it's -- it's really interesting 'cause there's a really big gap between their ages.  Now my oldest I had in public school from, uh, you know, from kindergarten through ninth grade.  And I was not pleased with his school in ninth grade so, I moved him to a private school.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I haven't -- e- essentially I haven't really seen very much, um, of the censorship issues coming up in the north -- and -- and I live near Philadelphia --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- um, I mean, I worked in Philadelphia for years.  One thing I got to say though is that one of the things that has come up is the types of books that people are reading now.  What they're t- -- they are not, um, here th- the parents groups and many other cultural advocacy groups here in the, uh, Pennsylvania slash New Jersey area, and I'm right on the border right outside of Princeton.  Um, [LIPSMACK] they're not really looking at censorship of subjects.  What they're trying to do is, um, make sure that certain types of books are included, rather than excluded from what's going on, uh, what's -- what's being, uh, given to the children as far as instruction goes.
L:  Oh.  So, including probably multi cultural type books?
R:  Exactly.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Exactly.  There's [MN] 
L:  I think that's very important and often times it's just let out.  And they're ex- -- um, especially [several inaudible words] and, you know, and so many things -- the social history, culture, and those things.  I wish, um, that was the type of censorship we had.  One of the censorship issues that came up in Mathew was, um, actually going through the, Steven Kellogg, folk tale books and going c- --
R:  I'm sorry.  What -- what were the books?
L:  The, Steven Kellogg, the author and illustrator.
R:  Okay.
L:  And the books are folk tales and it's Might Sink[?] and, um, Draw Me a Star.
R:  Well, I remember, Might Sink.
L:  Johnny Appleseed, those books and [several inaudible words] the little butt naked child. 
R:  Oh.
L:  You know, I'm, like, this little child.  But they actually had to do that because the way they do it, is they would do that instead of avoid a conflict.  Well, you know, I think maybe they should avoid conflict.  But on the other hand, my little niece was in a class, um, this year and I would think at this point, this is the one issue that I felt like my niece did not need to be forced to read --
R:  Right.
L:  -- uh, the book.  And it was a whole group; it was a whole class that was reading the book.  And, Gary Paulsen, is a great author, but they were reading Harry and Me.  And I don't see that book in several places as any different than reading porn.
R:  Really?
L:  Um, because there's se- -- are you familiar with the book?
R:  No.  I was going to ask you what exactly is contained in his book that is so, you said pornographic.  That's really scary.
L:  It is very scary because he is a great author and that is a book, if you look it up on the Internet that it's highly promoted.
R:  Right.
L:  And I think it's probably a book that, you know, sh- -- my sister certainly did not want it out of the library because any book can be used to teach a child right and wrong.
R:  Mm.
L:  Regardless of what is in it.  But she did not want the whole class.  She did not want Anna to be forced to be in a classroom reading it and --
R:  Yeah.  I understand that.
L:  -- that was the situation.  Um, the issue with the book is the two boys are -- there is one older child re- -- harassing another child --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and trying to get him to do things and they actually -- I'm almost embarrassed s- saying it and since you're a male, but they do they actually talk to their private --
R:  Oh, boy.
L:  -- and there's, um, there's some real they're looking at a picture and they start getting into descriptions of how it feels and, um --
R:  And now --
L:  -- I just thought you know, for --
R:  -- now this is for children of what age group?
L:  -- she -- she was in the, um, seventh grade.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  Seventh grade.  And --
R:  I wouldn't -- I wouldn't --
L:  -- and it was in a mixed classroom.
R:  Yeah.  I would not want that to be part of a school uh, curriculum.  You know, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'm a very liberal person mind you.  But I don't consider that type of thing necessary for education.
L:  [several inaudible words] not.  [LAUGH] I think if a parent wants to address the issues -- they have an issue with their child, but that is one situation where I really felt like -- and, you know, [inaudible] my sister addressed it correctly and the book went on.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, there was nothing [inaudible] be done about it.  I think there needs to be a difference though in what you leave on a library shelf for free choice, and what a child reads it in a classroom as a group.  I think if it's a group book that everybody has to read, that it needs to be in an award winning book or something that has to do with character development or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- something worth reading.
R:  Right.  I mean, [LAUGH] you know, and of course, I mean, the -- the criteria of what is worth reading and what is not is quite subjective, but on the other hand, there -- there are certain things that -- certain subjects and certain, um, [LIPSMACK] types of incidents that you simply should not, um, subject, for lack of a better word, younger children to.
L:  I think so.  And I don't think most adults would appreciate that piece of literature either.
R:  Yeah, I know -- I -- I know they wouldn't with my -- I have a child who's between kindergarten and first grade now.  Um, I make sure that I know everything -- everything that he is reading.  And I know his teachers very well.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I try to make sure that, you know, that not just the teachers, the principals, everyone.  Uh, that I am very much, uh, on top of everything that goes into his head either, uh, especially from school, but you know, especially at home as well.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, there's a new set of [several inaudible words] age group.  Have you -- are you familiar with the Dorothy Kindersley[?], um, sets of books.  They are brand new [NOISE] on the market.
R:  I don't think I know those.
L:  [LIPSMACK] I think it'll be the next set of Doctor Zeus and I Can Reads.
R:  Dorothy Kindersley.
L:  Um, uh, it's wonderful.  The pho- photography and the facts, and they are very clean books.  They stay very detailed, they give very precise facts, they have great photography.  Um, they're great books.
R:  Mm.
L:  They have 'em on almost -- they have 'em on science topics, social studies, um, topics and almost anything.   [MN] [inaudible] 
R:  That sounds pretty good.
L:  Yeah.  We have weird censorship in some areas of North Carolina too as far as books you can't read.  Some areas don't let people read the [inaudible] rabbit or Uncle Tom's Cabin or, um, different things like that.  Um, and, you know I think that's part of history too.  I think if it's a folk tale and it's off the past, I think it helps children understand.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I don't -- I don't see any problem with Uncle Tom's Cabin for one.  Um, you know, it -- it definitely refers to a -- to a time in our history that's not particularly great --
L:  Mhm.
R:  But -- but on the other hand, it's still something that if I me- -- I -- I've read, you know, on my own mostly because of when I was coming up, I didn't really have much guidance as to what I was going to read.  I ended up uh, reading a whole lot of different types of books on my own.  And -- and some made me think, and some made me mad, and some made me very sad.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But it was a situation in which everything I read, uh, had an effect and I guess I was sort of precocious as a youngster.  Uh, I started reading very early --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and therefore I was reading things that were way ahead of my mental, uh, of my maturity level I should say.  Uh, nevertheless, it was still very important that I was able to have access to a lot of these things.
L:  Mhm.  I did that too.  [LIPSMACK] I was a very, very early reader and just in -- read as much as I --
