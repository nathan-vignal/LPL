L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Hi.  This is, uh, Warner Bootzack.
L:  Hi, this is Tamara Fraser.
R:  And I'm in Los Angeles, California.
L:  Okay, I'm in Atlanta, Georgia.  And --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, I didn't exactly hear the question.  She said something -- it said something about schools requiring children to read.
R:  Ah, should they censor the books that, uh, children are reading in schools.
L:  Okay.
R:  I suppose they're referring to things like, uh, Tom Sawyer, where they --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- use the -- the N word, nigger.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, and what's your opinion?
L:  Um, I think, uh, a lot of 'em, they're probably too, referring to books like -- that are popular now like the Harry Potter books.  Because some of the, um, schools are against that because of the wizardry and the magic and the, you know, the potions and that type of thing.  And, um, I think if it's a public school, that, um, they -- they should have some right to censorship.  But, you know, I think it should be, like, a -- a -- a board decision or something.
R:  Right.
L:  I know that in the private schools, there's full censorship and, you know, that's understandable because it's a private school.  But I think in the public school, I mean, they shouldn't limit what a child reads on -- on their own, but as for what they read in school, you have to have limits --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- on what -- what a child is exposed to at school, because you may have parents that don't agree with what's being read at school as well.
R: So, how far should censorship go?
L:  Um, I don't think it's -- I think it should be just to the degree that they're sure that the children are getting -- reading what -- what is acceptable.  You know, in -- in a normal society.  I don't know if they should go as far as to say, you know, ban books from schools, or say that this book cannot enter the school.  Maybe it's just at a certain grade level it's not appropriate for.  Now what do you think?
R:  Well, d- -- w- when I went to school, I don't remember any books being censored.  Um, and I turned out to be a pretty rounded individual, uh, [MN] um, [PAUSE] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- course censor- -- see, when you start censoring --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- one thing, then you get into where do you draw the line?  Well, this offends one people and this offends another.  Uh, Muslim is offended by one thing, a black by another --
L:  Right.
R:  -- a white by a third thing.  Um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, gee, I -- I mean, it is a tough decision to make.
L:  Right.  When I was at school, we did have some censorship.  You know, when I was in school and I'm assuming we're from two, um, different eras.  I'm thirty four years old.
R:  You're thirty four and --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- I'm, um, uh, more like sixty.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  And we did have some censorship in our school.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, we were not allowed to read certain books that had like sexual connotations or anything like that.  Like, um, certain --
R:  Well, gee, I mean, did your school libraries for example, have a, uh, [LIPSMACK] subscription to, like, Playboy?
L:  No.  Mm mm.
R:  Well -- well, maybe the south was a little more censored then.  Because, uh, my school -- I -- I grew up in northern Los Angeles and -- and, uh, gee, uh, my school back there in the fifties had, um, you know, subscription to Playboy, which was --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, pretty risque at that time I guess, you know.
L:  Right.  [NOISE]
R:  They had girls, uh, you know, naked.
L:  Yes.  We didn't have anything of that sort.
R:  Course if you -- you could always look at the National Geographic [LAUGH] if you want to see a naked girl too.
L:  Yes.  That's true.
R:  And they didn't censor that.  I mean --
L:  Right.  And -- and they still don't censor National Geographic.  That's still very much out theres in all the schools.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, yeah, when I came through we did have, um, censorship.  We didn't have very many magazine subscriptions at all.  And all of the book were mostly like classical books, classical stories.  Now some of the ones like the one you mentioned with the Tom Sawyer, we had that.
R:  Okay.
L:  You know, so that wasn't --
R:  And it -- and it --
L:  -- the type --
R:  -- did have the N word in, didn't it? 
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  You know.  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  And I think it's just deciding on [SIGH] --
R:  Well, uh --
L:  -- what -- what to sensor. 
R:  -- well, what's your feeling on -- on Tom Sawyer by the way?  I mean, uh, you sound possibly that you're a black woman?
L:  Yes.  I am.  Mhm.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, and, I mean, I do- -- I didn't have a problem with the book at all.
R:  Okay.
L:  I mean, you know, I mean, there's -- you just have --
R:  I mean --
L:  -- to be -- you have to be diverse.
R:  Oth- -- yeah.  I mean, other than, you know, using a director, when he used it because it was just at the time, um, in --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I guess common usage.  And --
L:  Right.  For his day and time.
R:  -- and unfortunately, uh, you know --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- [several inaudible words] [SIGH] 
L:  And for his day and time in the south, that was the way things were.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, so, um, but I think now --
R:  And course you had -- they had nicknames for the whiteys too.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  They sure did.  [LAUGH] They sure did.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They sure did.  So, I mean, to say that things should be totally censored, I would say no.  But it's -- the society today to me, is, uh, a just a little bit different from how things were before.  You know, you just -- you have more risk of kids getting into things, more things happening --
R:  No.  [MN] 
L:  -- you just --
R:  You have children?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay.  And, uh --
L:  Small children.
R:  -- are they into the Internet?
L:  Yes.  But I don't allow --
R:  Um -- 
L:  -- them by themselves.
R:  Okay.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh --
L:  My son is ten. 
R:  -- and what do you think of libraries, uh, allowing children, uh, to, uh, get into the Internet at a library?
L:  Um, that again is, um, something that they have limits on here.  And, um, in our area.
R:  I don't think they have it here in Los Angeles.
L:  Yes.  They have limits here.
R:  They do?
L:  They have, um, blocks so that the children cannot get on certain sites.
R:  They cannot get into a s- -- for example, porno sites?
L:  Right.  [NOISE] They have -- they have blocks and when you sign your children up for library cards --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you state which blocks you would like, um, regarding Internet and books.  Wi- -- um, we -- you can, as a parent you can block which books your child check out -- checks out from the library.  What types of books.
R:  Oh, I didn't know that.
L:  Yes.  So, still here in the south, we're a little bit more --
R:  Little more --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- censorship there, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  That's -- that's the mentality around here.  [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yes, it's --
R:  Well [LAUGH] --
L:  -- it's all up to the parents and the teachers to, you know, decide what the children are going to read or see or do.
R:  Well, do you think there should be a uniform, uh, morality?  Or do you think it should vary from [PAUSE] or area to area of di- -- um, coun- -- 
L:  I think it needs to be a little bit more --
R:  -- state to state?
L:  -- uniform.  To come to a median.  Little bit more uniform.  That's what I think.  I think, you know, you have one area that's from one extreme, like, where you are.  And then you have the area on -- on our side, which is the -- the opposite extreme.  And I think there would be a median somewhere in between.
R:  Now wi- where are the age of your children?
L:  Ten and six.
R:  Ten and six.  So -- so, y- you're --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you wouldn't want them reading a copy of Playboy?  Or you -- consider that, uh -- 
L:  Right.  
R:  -- consider that, uh --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but I mean a lot of people, there are [LAUGH] claim that they read Playboy for the, uh -- uh, literary articles in there.
L:  Yes.  And, uh, my husband does, because he likes the articles.  But how many children are going to be focused on the articles?
R:  Yeah.  Well, th- that's true.
L:  You know -- 
R:  So, maybe --
L:  -- it all depends on the maturity of the mind.
R:  -- so your -- your library doesn't even get a subscription to that?
L:  No.  They don't.
R:  Okay. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Well, here I guess they give it out to older children who, uh, I guess are old enough to read the literary articles and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and maybe they take out the centerfold and things.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, uh --
L:  So, um, is -- do you think there's any type of censorship much of -- of anything out there in your area; in California where you are?
R:  Well, [SIGH] for example, uh, [SIGH] I was at this, um, rally for at, uh, against, George Bush's, uh, blood for oil in Centric[?] City.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, when I read the newspaper the next day, uh, they came up with an article that said, uh, they were half for and half against, uh, George Bush.  And the ones who were against him were senile elderly, or communist, uh, anarchists.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, I'm a registered Republican.  I am neither an anarchist, nor a communist.  Nor do I feel I'm senile.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, nor am I elderly -- I don't feel elderly -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- though I'm sixty.  Um, but this is how the newspaper described it.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, some child or anyone picking up the Los Angeles Times, will read the --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- senile and the anarchists were, uh, the only ones protesting, George, uh, George's, policy in -- in the Iraq, uh, look for oil.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  So, uh, it gives a wrong impression, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- now this in my opinion, is a form -- possibly the owner of the Times, uh, wi- -- uh, which is I think Chicago Tribune --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, owners, uh, I believe, uh, wanted to, uh, suppress the true nature of the, uh, um, event and, uh, decided to have the reporters report it, uh, negatively, uh, of those against, Bush.  You know, just the elderly or the senile, or the, uh, anarchists was --
L:  Right.
R:  -- protesting.  And I think, um, maybe even yourself might not have voted for, George Bush.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  And I am a Democratic, so I probably wouldn't have or didn't.  So [LAUGH] ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, um, and it has nothing to do with -- and I -- I generally -- I don't vote straight party though, I just -- I vote for the best candidate, who I feel is the best candidate.  So, yeah.
R:  So, do you think that's a form of censorship?  That because so, uh, few people, uh, own the media today; that means the bookstores and the -- the, uh, newspapers, magazines and television and radio; that it's in the hands of just five people -- major companies --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, uh -- 
L:  That's a form --
R:   -- therefore they're able to censor the news in a sense.
L:  -- of censorship in itself, right.  That's a form of censorship in itself, exactly.
R:  Right.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Uh, so, do you think our congress should allow, uh, [MN] so few people to control so much of the media?
L:  No.  And I, actually I don't.   And I've always said that I think that, you know, those certain few companies have the monopoly and I think that you would get better coverage --
