R:  Hello.
L:  Hello, this is Greg.
R:  Greg, this is Shaun.  How are you?
L:  All right Shaun.  Uh, I didn't quite catch -- I had a distraction, uh, the exact topic.  Can you relay it back to me?
R:  Uh, it was [COUGH] do you think public schools should be able to require books -- to require certain reading of books.
L:  Oh, okay.  I had a slight distraction --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, uh, [PAUSE] --
R:  I --
L:  -- I couldn't hear at all.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Uh, so what do you think, Shaun?  What's your ...
R:  Well, I think it's part of having a standard curriculum for most people to have reading 'cause there's certain books that are a part of American history.  Mm, what about you 
L:  No.  I agree -- I agree that there is -- there is certain books that have to be read, but, uh, I can't think of anything off the top of my head.  But there's always certain locations, uh, you hear about more predominantly in the Bible belt --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- um, that -- or in one school district, that they think that this book -- and a lot of them are -- are classics that we've read all through school, and they think they should be taken out now because they have sorcery, witchcraft, or adult themes that were, you know, I read -- I can't think of book now, uh ...
R:  The Catcher in the Rye, I know off the top of my head is -- been a source of, uh, debate. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Have you heard of the Catcher of the Rye? 
L:  Yeah.  I don't remember what that's about though.
R:  Uh, it was, let's see, I don't remember off the -- it was about a kid and he -- I think he was a druggie or something like that.
L:  I mean, I guess I -- I -- I think you should be able to read just about anything.  I mean, I'm not saying put Playboy and Penthouse in high school or, you know, libraries, but ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [COUGH] You know, a lot of that is from what I think a child's taught at home.  Of what's proper and improper.
R:  That's true.  But [NOISE] I think, uh, most of the books that kids read today are at school.  They don't do much outside reading o- of their own, as far as, uh, t- -- uh, novels.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I think it is important for the schools to -- to require certain kinds of reading, and ban certain other ones if they feel that it's not necessary for their edu- -- or it's not necessary for certain -- [MN] if it's not a, you know, necessary [NOISE] could be potentially bad for a student.
L:  I think I understand where you're coming from.  Uh, but, you know, I've heard of several instances where it's just one parent, you know, who wants the school board to ban a book for the whole school system.
R:  That's true.
L:  You know, or maybe two parents and they may be two out of a hundred.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, I think majority rules in that case.  
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I've heard some extreme cases like that.
L:  And, uh, [PAUSE] and I'm all for freedom but, you know, freedom comes at a price.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, you know, exactly where do you decide what is good and what is bad.  And I think it's up for the majority in the school system to decide.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I guess I'm -- I'm -- I'm agreeing to limited, uh, censorship.
R:  Yeah.  I agree too.
L:  I mean, that, like I said they shouldn't have Penthouse and Playboy in -- I don't think that's necessary reading for a high school library.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But there are certain novels that, you know, um, school and education is to open our minds to something we might not be able to see or experience in our own surroundings.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I think, uh, if teachers even today, it -- it's all right to read the book, but as long as they discuss why they -- people feel it should be banned.  Just discussing why --would be -- kinda opens the eyes of kids today to this -- the issues that are talked about amongst their parents.  And that way just talking about it will, uh, enlighten them about the -- the certain issues about racism for example.
L:  Right.
R:  'Cause that's --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- a big talk of -- in terms of some of the books that are [inaudible] --
L:  I mean, because you've got a lot of kids now that have no idea really what racism is.  And others who -- who still, you know, live in areas where they're almost like the sixties.  Racism still lives.  It's just not as broad spanned.
R:  Yeah.  May I ask where you're calling from?
L:  I'm from in South Western Virginia.  And you?
R:  Oh.  Ah, California.
L:  When I was in the military and I got experience to a wide variety of people and places --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so, uh, you know, [MN] and like I said freedom doesn't come free.
R:  That's true.  Yeah.  And I think that's one thing that is hard to -- to teach kids in books try to do --
L:  Well, I think a lot of it is, like, we've talked of these isolated instances of censorship mass censorship; you know, parents got to teach their child what's right and what's wrong.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And --
R:  But it's ha- -- sometimes hard for a parent to go against the curriculum.  Th- then it's kind of -- if they're required to read it, but the parents are telling them it's not true or don't believe anything they say.  It kinda takes away the credibility of the school.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause ideally I think a parent would like to h- h- -- put, like, their children to trust the school that they go to and what they learn or what they teach 'em.
L:  Oh, I agree.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And there's, you know, there's a lot of things, uh, particularly in, you know, we were made to read a lot of things here in Virginia on Virginia history --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- which is broad spanned.  From the settlement of Jamestown and on but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- some books you can only believe so much.   And there's a lot of things that, you know, who knows how it's written?  Or wh- what aspect is behind it.  [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But the more sometimes that you fight for sponsor- -- uh, so- -- censorship on some issues, the more kids will want to read to find out why you're so against it.
R:  So, it could have a positive 'cause I think it's always good just any kind of reading for a kid.  It's just building their analytical or their -- their reading skills.
L:  And -- and analytical mind; I'd agree. 
R:  Uh-huh.  So ...
L:  Yeah, I think it builds all that on how to think for ourselves, and too many people don't these days.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Or, they're not taught to -- how to think for themselves or -- [PAUSE] but, uh, I -- I agree that there is a certain amount of censorship is needed.  But it has to be, I don't know, controlled or limited.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It shouldn't wide spread.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Like, uh, a good case here in Virginia, Jerry Falwell[?], fought against, Larry Flint, over censorship.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, and said oh, his hustler was bad and all that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't read it on a regular basis but if you want to, that's -- that's your decision to make.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Not me to make mine -- make yours for you.
R:  Yeah.  And I think [MN] the multiple cases the Supreme Court has ruled in favor of just, you know, if you don't want to read the book, then don't read it.  They said it's -- i- it's just giving freedom. 
L:  I'd agree.
R:  Yeah.  So, I hate -- i- i- if they put a alternative to a book, that would make sense [MN] certain parents.  'Cause I know today they say, like, if you don't want to read this book or i- i- i- -- special cases like sexual education, parents have the freedom to take their kids out of that.  I- if they --
L:  Right.
R:  -- if they wanted to they could have alternative books and, you know, if there was enough people, you know, half the class didn't want to, then [MN] they'd have to both have -- I guess it can go either way with the book.  But if there's a -- just a certain group, [NOISE] y- you know, they could probably just each those groups that book, and another book.  It does take away from a standard education though -- standard curriculum.  But ...
L:  Well, you know, I think there is a need for standard curriculum because we as Americans are stupid.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've traveled enough [MN] overseas to know most European countries and a lot of Asian countries --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- require English as a second language.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  There's very few places that -- well, there's several places in the states, that people have dual languages.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But it's very rarely mandatory to have, or almost mandatory to have a second language.
R:  Yes.  [NOISE] 
L:  A lot of people do in some areas of the United States because they come from a different background.
R:  Yes.
L:  So, uh, you know, a lot of --
