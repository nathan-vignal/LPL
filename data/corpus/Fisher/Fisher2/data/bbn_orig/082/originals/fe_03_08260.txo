L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, this is -- this is Dick.
L:  Hi.  My name's Kathy.
R:  Bobby?
L:  Kathy.
R:  Kathy.
L:  Yes.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Nice [MN] Kathy, okay.  What do you think of censorship in schools for, uh, books?
L:  You know, I -- I didn't hear the subject real good.  It was on what about books in the schools?
R:  Yeah, well, books in schools.  [MN] Books should select books.  Teachers should select books for schools.  They do, don't they?
L:  You mean library books or text books. 
R:  Text books I'd imagine.  A- and library books too.
L:  Mhm.  And the subject was, if teachers should select them?
R:  Should schools select 'em.
L:  Oh.  I think they do now.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I guess.  I -- 
R:  Yeah, they take them.
L:  Uh --  
R:  Is that right or wrong?
L:  Well, I don't know who else --
R:  Somebody has to do it.
L:  Yeah.  Somebody's got to do it so [LAUGH] um --  
R:  Does the public schools do that?  Or do private schools do that?  Or do religious schools do that?  Or do state schools do that?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Does every city in the country have its own censorship board on -- for text books?  They do, don't they?
L:  I think so.  
R:  [MN] 
L:  Yeah, I really don't even know how it works; how they pick out, you know, the books --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that they have.  I don't really know the process involved and who gets to do that.
R:  Of course the Supreme Court has a say over all that as to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- whether some should be set or not.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But there's a certain amount of, um, leeway.
L:  I think so too because I know some schools wouldn't allow Harry Potter in their library --
R:  Oh, is that right?
L:  Yes.  I heard that on the news.  That's about a year or so ago.  Some schools wouldn't allow it and most schools did.  But some schools wouldn't allow it.  So, I guess it's up to the school --
R:  I'll be darned.
L:  -- to decide.  And once the parents got irate about it, maybe they would change their minds, but -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- so, I guess it's up to each individual school to do it.  [COUGH] [PAUSE] And I don't -- I don't know it there's a better solution for that.  I guess when parents find out something has been banned from the schools, they don't like it.   They need to speak up, along with the kids.  [PAUSE] You know, that's --
R:  Mm.  But it sold five million books the w- in one night, the first night it opened just last month. 
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.   [LAUGH] It's a popular book.  My kids never did get into it but [PAUSE] I've a lot of friends whose kids just devour the books soon as they come out.  [COUGH] So long as it gets kids t- to read I guess. 
R:  Right.
L:  But --
R:  Those books are the long book.  They're big books. 
L:  Oh, they are.  I seen a --
R:  Eight hundred pages.
L:  Yeah.  I -- a friend of mine bought one for her son, and, uh, that thing was thick.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Like encyclopedia or dictionary or something.
L:  Yeah.  It was really thick.
R:  But you know, if kids read that, that's good for 'em.
L:  Oh, I think so too.  Um, she went to Kansas --
R:  How could they ban that from schools when the kids like to read it?
L:  I know.
R:  Maybe it's reverse psychology.
L:  Uh, yeah.  [LAUGH] Well, that was about a year or so ago.  Maybe the schools came around.  I think they thought it had something to do with witchcraft or something.
R:  Oh, witchcraft?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't know.  I've never read the books, but I think that's what the schools thought.  It had some kind of witchcraft or something in it.  It would encourage kids to practice witchcraft, which I've never heard a kid yet who's read the book, who's thought that at all. 
R:  I've never read the book or seen the movie even, so I don't know.
L:  Yeah.  I haven't either.  But ...
R:  So, it was banned, huh?
L:  In cert- --
R:  In some schools? 
L:  -- yeah.  In certain schools they had it on the news about a year or so ago.
R:  Huh.
L:  But [PAUSE] none of the schools around here.
R:  Well, I'm in -- I actually -- maybe they were using reverse psychology if the students thought they couldn't read it, maybe they would go to the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- library and get it and read it.
L:  Yeah.  Encourage them to read.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Encourage them to read.
L:  Yeah.  That could be [PAUSE] but ...
R:  You know, if you can't do something you want to do it.
L:  Yeah.  That's right.  [LAUGH] You want to do what you're not supposed to.
R:  [several inaudible words] they didn't want to pay it; they weren't getting any price break on it.  I can't believe that that book would be --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- censored for moral reasons or something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Character reading.
L:  The friend of mine that bought her -- the book for her kid out in Kansas City.  She went to, like, a book fair, like, a -- for you know, a -- schools have book fairs for kids?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  She paid, like, thirty bucks for that book.
R:  Is that right?
L:  And -- and they re only seventeen ninety nine at Walmart.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, is that right?
L:  So, the school really made some money off that book.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] But -- and then on the way back from Kansas City, her son was reading it out loud to her [NOISE] so she said it was worth it 'cause at least he'll read it.  So -- [PAUSE] but they kind of picked a hard subject for us.  [LAUGH] It's not -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's not something I know a whole lot about.  [PAUSE] Have you done --
R:  What I -- I remem- -- when I was in gr- -- school, uh, professors or teachers when I was in high school and grade school; sometimes with text books for you to read in the summer time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they would -- they would give you some credit for it on the school year or something.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  I remember doing that back when I was in grade school.  We had to make a list of all the books we read over the summer.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then bring it back in the next school year.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [COUGH] I know now my daughter's -- they give points for books.  But it has to be books off the certain list.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then they -- they take, like, a test on it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then they're given points [PAUSE] if they get the answers correct.  [COUGH] And then after so many points, you get a reward of some sort.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, but she gets discouraged because it's -- there is books she wants to read that aren't on the list.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So [COUGH] ...
R:  I've always liked reading non fiction books.  I read those on my own.  Text books --
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  -- and philosophy books and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- other --
L:  I -- 
R:  -- kinds of books that are non fiction.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't -- fiction -- I just -- I just -- I just can't get into fiction really.
L:  [LAUGH] I mean --
R:  Did it -- to do it on my own it -- when I was in school I had to read 'em [inaudible] it was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- very difficult for me to read a book like Moby Dick or something.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I --
R:  All which we had to do it and th- -- I didn't mind reading Shakespeare.  That -- that was al right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, uh, read these thick novels; I couldn't do it.
L:  Hm.  Yeah, I like non fiction probably better than fiction.  I like books on, uh, investments, like, money and --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Me too.  I can read -- you read the Wall Street Journal?
L:  I got a, like, a trial subscription for free --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and -- and I would read it.  But after that ran out I never got it again.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Ooh. 
L:  But I do like it. 
R:  I enjoy it.
L:  I think it's interesting.
R:  Yeah.  They write good stuff in there.  Some of the -- some of 'em are -- some of them [inaudible] [NOISE] I get a subscription and some of them are better than others.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're more interesting.
L:  [COUGH] I do like to read Sidney Sheldon though.  He's a fiction writer.
R:  What's he write about?
L:  Oh, um, it's usually, like, murder mysteries, but they're usually pretty complicated.  And there's us- -- there -- a lot of times there's a series of 'em.  You think you're done with one book, but then he'll come out with another.  Kinda carrying it on.  
R:  Uh.
L:  But he's pretty good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  He's good about, uh, putting twists in there, things you don't expect.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But usually I -- I buy more non fiction than fiction.
R:  Me too.  Right now I'm [inaudible] a book on economics and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'm interested in the economy [NOISE] with --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Greenspan trying to manage our economy [inaudible] and, uh, I know more about finance than I do about economics.  But, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I know a little bit about economics.
L:  Have you read, Suzie Orman? 
R:  What book is that called?
L:  Um, she's -- actually she's, um, an investment, uh, oh, she's the investment person on, I think it's the NBC --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- she does her own -- she has her own show on Saturdays and Sundays.  And then she's got a lot of books out.
R:  Yeah.
L:  She's pretty good.  I like reading her investment books.
R:  Oh, [inaudible] I'm not interested in investing.  I'm interested in knowing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't think investment is a crap shoot.
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- today especially.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  I was reading yesterday where some [several inaudible words] but, uh, I was re- reading an article last night in the Wall Street Journal --
