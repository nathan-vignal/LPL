L:  My name is Sydney Miller.
R:  [NOISE] [NOISE] [NOISE] [PAUSE] Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  [NOISE] Hi Cindy?
L:  Syd- Sydney like Australia.
R:  Okay, Sydney.  Hi.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  My name's Alice.
L:  Oh, nice to meet you.
R:  How are you?
L:  Fine, thank you.
R:  Um, I kinda -- I sort of missed the topic.  It was a little fuzzy.
L:  It's actually -- it's about um [LIPSMACK] censorship.  Do they --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- think public and private sh- schools should be allowed to forbid children to read certain books?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um [SIGH] well, I think private schools should be allowed.  What about you?
L:  Well, personally I'm big --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- anti censorship so I'm kinda going, uh, with nay on both counts.  I don't know, I mean is it in the context of school or just in general?  Like the students --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- at home?
R:  Yeah, I'm not too sure.  Um [MN] I mean, I think that uh it's --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the jurisdiction of the parents to choose whether or not to send a -- a child to private school and there's all sorts of factors to take into consideration [NOISE] when they choose a school --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- 'specially if it's private.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] I wa- -- I -- I went to Catholic school so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- there was certainly quite a bit of censorship going on there --
L:  Oh, I can imagine. [LAUGH]
R:  -- [NOISE] and um I don't kno- -- ne- necessarily think that it hurt me because I -- I think out -- [NOISE] outside of that my parents were pretty liberal minded.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So um  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] I mean, I think you have to look at the whole picture when you choose a school --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- no matter what.
L:  Well, I think that -- I mean I -- I --
R:  And I think public -- public schools shouldn't -- should definitely not be allowed because um --
L:  We're paying for it? [LAUGH]
R:  We're paying for it and also um --
L:  [NOISE] [NOISE] 
R:  -- a lot of people don't have a choice --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- whether or not to send their children to private. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, that's true --
R:  You know?
L:  -- especially --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- not only the money but just where you live. 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I lived in a very rural area and I -- private school wasn't an option just because [NOISE] [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, the nearest school was like twenty miles and I certainly couldn't walk that far. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  But I -- I think in terms of like censoring the books, I think that for a private school, I don't think it's right.  I think --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they can choose the reading material that they --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- present in their classes but I don't think there is any way they can censor what the child reads.  You know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in the privacy of their own home or on their own time.
R:  Right.  Well, I mean --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- I don't know if you're familiar with -- I-- I'm from the New York area and the -- the Regents' --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- exams are um [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [NOISE] it just sort of came out that they've been censoring them for years.  The excerpts --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that -- that are part of the exam.  They're given as examples of, ah, text to students.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they're liberally --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- censored, um, in the sense that --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [NOISE] um [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- passages or words are deleted from -- from the text.  There's no indication that there's been a deletion.
L:  Really?  Did they replace it --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- or did they just kind of delete it where it can --
R:  They take it out.
L:  [MN] That's odd. 
R:  I don't think they're -- yeah.  It's a little scary. [NOISE] 
L:  I think there's a lot of things scary -bout the Regents' exam personally.
R:  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  Wow.  I don't --
R:  But um -- [NOISE] 
L:  Well, I went to a very -- a private school for two years in high school for ninth and tenth grade and they were -- they weren't Catholic but they were super, um, conservative Christians --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and in my world literature class we read things like um, The Pilgrim's Progress and so on and so forth, but we had free reading topics too where we had to read a book in like a week --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and write a paper on it, and I read something like [SIGH] I think A Clockwork Orange --
R:  Right.
L:  -- which I'm sure is something they probably wouldn't have ticked for me to read personally.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Right.
L:  But, you know.  I read it.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.  I mean I can't say that any of the literature I read in -- in high school or [MN] grammar school was particularly [PAUSE] [NOISE] --
L:  Lewd.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- radical but um, you know I don't think it necessarily [NOISE] m- means that I had a -- a limited education.  So I think -- I don't know -- I guess it depends on the sc- -- the school really.
L:  Well, I think it -- something should [MN] -- what do you consider censorship?  Is it censorship when -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- when they don't directly say, "You can't read this book" but the books that they select to be read are --
R:  Of a certain type. [NOISE] 
L:  -- of one particular mind set or very conservative [MN] or whatever the case may be?
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH] I think too, you know, I don't -- I don't ever remember having read any books in middle school or high school that were what I would consider lewd.  And like, I know with Catcher in the Rye --
R:  Mm
L:  -- isn't that something that --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- they banned um in public schools kind of a way back or something like that?  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Or they removed it from the shelves of the libraries?  Do you know anything about that?
R:  Um, yes.  It was [MN] -- that's one of the banned books.  Um, I think that's actually -- it's still being banned in some -- in some areas.  That's [LIPSMACK] one of the strange things.  I mean Huckleberry Finn even.  [SIGH] Um --
L:  Rea- -- and I've never r- read that.  I've read the Tom Sawyer one but --
R:  Huckleberry Finn I believe the N word is -- is used in it.
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, and for that reason and also because they think of um the relationship between uh Huck and -- and uh the older man.  Um, in -- in some cases it's been banned um as recently as like last year.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Wow.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Which is a little sc- -- yeah.  It's a little scary when you find out, like you know, people are still you know censoring these things um [NOISE] for really kind of s- silly --
L:  Queer reasons. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- backward reasons.  Yeah.  I don't know.
L:  Want to know books too -- I know I've --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [MN] I haven't read a lot about it but in that there's instances where I can -- in school libraries they won't provide copies of things like [SIGH] Our Bodies Our Selves --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to -- for people that you know -- to check out at will because it's [SIGH] -- it's sexual or in some cases maybe you know, it's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- pornographic.  Not --
R:  Right.
L:  -- not [MN] on purpose but just in its depictions and stuff and that, to me, seems odd.  I'm thinking, "Well, you know, you wonder why everyone's getting pregnant and getting STDs.  Maybe if [NOISE] they could educate themselves --"
R:  Right.
L:  "-- about it they might not". [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  But heaven forbid --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- we teach anyone anything. [LAUGH] But, um 
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I um, [LIPSMACK] -- I mean I'm generally of the opinion that censorship is not a good idea --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I think that it is -- it is allowable for a private institution to -- to essentially censor materials that are taught or words that are used because it's -- it becomes a closed system when it -- when it's private.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] So [NOISE] um [NOISE] 
L:  So it's not -- it's -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- there's really no legal control over it.
R:  [NOISE] Right.  I think it's --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  --I think it's [NOISE] -- allowable.  I mean, I don't necessarily condone it but --
L:  [MN] I -- I -- I can see it -- like, within the --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- bounds of the legal system, how it would [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- literally --
R:  Right.
L:  -- make sense if the private instit- -- it's like your private house.  You can't --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know censor -- well -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know --
R:  Well, you're allowed to do --
L:  -- we -- we got to talk about the Patriot Act but [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I mean you -- you should have the freedom to -- to choose what goes on in your house.  It's kind've the same idea [SIGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as what I'm sort of thinking.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I'm glad this -- it still kind of strikes a poor chord with me to think that people are -- I guess it depends on the intentions, you know?  I wouldn't give [NOISE] a book about sex and [NOISE] violence to a group of second graders but high school seniors can probably handle it. 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Probably read something like it before on the internet anyway.
R:  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  'Cause it's not like nobody's ever seen this before. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] I don't know.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And what do you thin- -- oh --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- what do you think about like, um, how they monitor the internet systems?
R:  [NOISE] Um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] I mean I think you can -- you sorta have to.  Um [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] you know I -- [MN] -- ch- children are curious and they -- they tend to be rebellious at certain stages and [NOISE] um [NOISE] you know there's also a legal issue where you -- you could be liable if -- if you know, a parent or -- [NOISE] or anyone finds out that a child learned something or um saw something that they didn't want them to while [NOISE] on your watch.  You know, that kind of thing.
L:  In a +public school or a private school?
R:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] Um, I think either one I guess.  So, I guess, ah, a certain amount of censorship is allowable in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- either case. [NOISE] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  But --
L:  Have you ever read any books that you wouldn't want a s- --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- uh high school or middle school student to read?  Do you think -- I mean do --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you think, "Whoa.  You know I could handle that because I was an adult but --"
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  "-- I really wouldn't want, you know a fifteen --"
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  "-- year old kid to read it"?
R:  [NOISE] Um, yeah.  I mean I've [NOISE] -- I've definitely read material that I probably wouldn't say, "Oh here, [LIPSMACK] you know --"
L:  "Go read this".
R:  "-- go ahead and read it" but [NOISE] --
L:  But should it be censored?  In the school then?  'Cause it's not [MN] you know, something that you'd want a kid to read but is it -- is it right for you to censor at a public --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- school? [PAUSE] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Even if you don't feel like it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a good idea.
R:  [NOISE] Um [PAUSE] [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] I think I've -- [NOISE] I think I lost track of the tr- -- the question.
L:  Oh, I'm sorry.  [SIGH] Like [MN] just think of a specific example or whatever of a book that you've read --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and you think, "Oh, I wouldn't want ah a high school or middle school student to read that" but when you feel that way [SIGH] you can think about that book and think, "Well then, should that be censored"?  
R:  [NOISE] Um --
L:  It -- it -- it's harder to make a judgement call sometimes when you have a specific [NOISE] instance in mind you know.
R:  Right.  [SIGH] I mean I think that, [MN] no matter what, I mean when the teacher starts working on a -- [MN] a lesson plan they have to -- they have to make decisions like that every [NOISE] -- every time they turn around so, I mean, in essence, just teaching in itself is -- is [NOISE] -- is almost like censorship.  I mean --
