L:  Nancy.
R:  Joy.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Nancy?
L:  Hi, Joy.
R:  Hi. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] 
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  We have to talk about censorship? [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't know what to say about censorship, um.  G- --
L:  Like --
R:  -- I don't, like--
L:  They was like, "This is the topic.  It's, like, censorship, like, um, certain books in school", like.  We- [MN] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um, where're you --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- from?
R:  [NOISE] I'm from Long Island, New York.
L:  Oh, I'm in -- I'm in --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- Astoria. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, you are? [LAUGH] [MN] 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Um, no --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it's like, okay, like, say, like [LIPSMACK] -- like, they have, like certain books [LIPSMACK] like, um --
R:  Yeah, I went to -- I went to public schools.  I mean, I didn't really get censorship with books but we didn't read, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- obscene things so it's not --
L:  Right.  It's like, it's the same --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- thing.  It's the same thing --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- like, what -- what if they have to show --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] -- I -member with the little Nappy Girl -- my mother had -- had a black book called The Nappy Girl and they had a problem with that.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
L:  And they tried to censor it.  Yeah.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  'Cause of, like --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- she got black hair and all she's talking 'bout a whole lotta nappy rubes[?] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and blah, blah, blah.
R:  Nah.  See I went to a -- a somewhat white school so therefore --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- I -- we didn't even, ah -- we didn't even participate in a Nappy Girl book, but, no.  I [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- I don't know nothing -bout that, but --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, 'cause there's -- like, all we read is Tom Sawyer --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and Huckleberry --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- Finn, and you know my -- um, what is the other one?  The Catcher in The Rye.  It's like --
R:  Ann Frank and all the other stuff?
L:  Yeah.  All that crap.  We're still reading it. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, I r- --
L:  Still reading it.
R:  I didn't read it when I was supposed to so, um [LIPSMACK] I dunno.  I really didn't care too much for it [SIGH] but, yeah.  We didn't have censorship in our school.  Not that I know of.  We didn't really care though.  The lot of people that I actually hung out with didn't care --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- what the hell we was reading so we're not gonna argue about it, but I think it should be censorship though.
L:  Yeah.  'Cause there's a lotta racist stuff out there but there was like this book, like, Little Nappy Girl --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it was just -- it was just a girl talking 'bout her hair.  How her hair was kinky.  It was a children's book.  [LIPSMACK] Like, for elementary school.  And it caused, like, such a riot, and it --
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  And it took, like, I think it, like, a year finally before it finally came on the shelves --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- 'cause they wouldn't even let it in school and, like, some teachers, like, actually, um -- they read it to them on the side.
R:  I don't -- I don't think that that should be allowed.  I --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- if it's censored for a reason then I think it should be censored 'cause [SIGH] [MN] well, that -- that particular book, the way it sounds doesn't seem like it's -- it's [NOISE] hurtful to anybody.  It's not like it's, you know, questioning anybody's beliefs about God or what they believe in --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- so, I mean, if there be a line drawn -- if it's -- if it's actually, you know, something that's dealing with a higher power or something like that, or evil or y- know devils or something -- yeah, should be censored, but other than that [NOISE] I don't -- I don't know.  The Nappy Girl thing, I think I would've -- should've been allowed to read it [NOISE] if it would have been brought up in my school.  I would've wanted to read it --
L:  Same thing.
R:  -- but --
L:  Same here.
R:  -- [NOISE] I dunno. [SIGH] But I've actually --
L:  Are you in school now?
R:  Yeah, I'm in college now.
L:  Which college you at?  I go to Baruch.
R:  I go to FIC in the city.
L:  Oh -- oh okay, cool. Over there by -- on the shadow? [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, over there and party -- parties are -sential.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah [MN] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- w- we was up there --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the other night.
R:  Yeah, I went to a place --
L:  I went to your school --
R:  -- I went to a place called Speed[?] like, last week -- got fined twenty --
L:  Wow.  Is that still open?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, gosh, that club is disgusting.
R:  [NOISE] [MN] Well, they played all hip hop.  I'd been invited --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- by friends so therefore I -- I was just, "All right". [LIPSMACK] So -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  I don't know whether --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you live closer to the city than I do so we don't venture --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- out there too much 'cause that's a --
L:  But --
R:  -- ride and then drinking and stuff, that's a problem.  So --
L:  Yeah, but a couple of my friends they --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um, party at the, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- Boardy Barn over there to Hampton.
R:  Yeah -- yeah -- yeah -- yeah -- yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That place gets crazier.
L:  Yeah.  That's what she told me --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- 'cause she's like, "Nancy, come on, let's go -- let's go" [LAUGH] and I --
R:  Nah, that -- that place g- [LAUGH] --
L:  I'm like --
R: -- gets crazy.
L:  Yeah.  That's -- that's -- aw- that's the other side --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- to me.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Way, way out on the other side.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  A lot of people don't even like coming out here to the Prague unless --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it's to the Hamptons. [NOISE] 
L:  Mhm.  So how was it at FIC?  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Like, um, what's your major?
R:  [SIGH] Ah, fabric style and basically the fashion -- the fashion.
L:  Mm.  See --
R:  Regular old fashion.
L:  -- see I don't have to take any English classes and stuff like that.
R:  Yeah.  We do.  We have the same, like, so many requirement things that you have to take -- all these little new courses and stuff.  We have to take English and [SIGH] Math and everything that's general studies.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But then you just go on to your main study in, like, your [NOISE] -- I guess your sophomore year or once you finish your associates or whatever you want -- juggle.
L:  [NOISE] Ah --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they do associates too?  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I thought that was just the bachelors.
R:  [NOISE] Nah, nah.  They do associates too.  I'm in my -- I was in my senior year so I'm about to get my bachelors in a hot minute.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  But other than that -- yeah.  They -- they do everything.  You get certificates [several inaudible words] -- everything.  So --
L:  I wonder if they could be the ones -- others -- other -- one of my friends she wanted to go there too 'cause she wanted to sell her own clothing line, or so she say, you know.  They say one thing and do the next.
R:  Oh, I don- [LAUGH] sell [inaudible] -- I'm not into designing clothes.  No, I don't -- I don't sell -- I don't do none of that.  I just want to um, dress people, I think. [NOISE]
L:  Ah, that's cool though.
R:  [NOISE] Ah, why -- what do you go to school for?
L:  Um, journalism --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- creative writing.

L:  Yeah, that's -- that's the one I need.  That's all I need.  'Cause I even walked the graduation.  That's all I need is -- is internship.
R:  Oh, so what're you gonna do that; over the summer or coming up?
L:  No, in the fall.  They only -- they --
R:  [NOISE]
