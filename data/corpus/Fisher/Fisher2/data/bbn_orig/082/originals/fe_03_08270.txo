L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi. I'm Laura.
L:  Hey, what's up, Laura?  I'm Davis.
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  Hey, what's up?  Uh, I think they said the -- what was the topic?  It was, um, should --
R:  The topic is, um, if you think that public and private schools should be allowed to do censorship of books.
L:  Okay, yeah.  I think I had a phone call like this earlier today.  Actually this is my second phone call today.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, well what -- what's your opinion on that first?  I'll let you go.
R:  Well, I don't know.  I did a study on it like when I was little, like not real little but younger and, um, and I read a lot of the books that were on the censorship lists and I thought they were really good books and I thought that, you know, probably what they should do is let the parents know what kind of books the kids are reading so they can have some kind of input on it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I don't think all the books, you know, are bad out there. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think it kinda depends, you know, on if the parents don't want their children to read a book or something maybe just let the parents know what kind of books you're reading and then they can have some kind of input if they don't want their children reading a book, I guess.
L:  Yeah, that's kinda like the similar thing I was saying earlier on to this lady I was talking to, um, because I live here in the city, like New York City.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, basically like over here, like, they don't really have, like, a huge deal, like, in school.  Like they don't really, like, make a big deal, like, about books but I mean, they -- they should tell parents I think.
R:  Right.
L:  Like you know, what your kids are reading.  I mean, like, some parents, like, have, like, a big problem with their kids reading like Harry Potter --
R:  Right.
L:  -- for example --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and, like, Harry Potter's, like, really popular over here in New York and, um, basically a lot of parents -- the reason they don't like that, the reason, like, I guess they -- they wouldn't want schools to say, like, you know, let's have, like, this month of study on, like, Harry Potter or something is that a lot of them --
R:  Right.
L:  -- thinks it promotes, um, witchcraft.
R:  Okay.
L:  You know, and like that's, you know, kinda like their own thing, you know what I mean.  Like --
R:  Or maybe you have options, you know, for the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- kids if you -- you can choose a book and then, you know, that would help out a lot too with parents.  If they don't like one book, read a different --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- book so that would be an option.
L:  I think it depends on the school also because some schools are, like, a lot more stricter, you know what I mean?  Like they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- well, your kid's in this course so, you know, this is, like, a -- it's mandatory for this course for the kid to, like, read like, you know, the Bible or read, like, whatever, you know what I mean?
R:  Right, right.  And then your parents would obviously know, you know, if they're in [LAUGH] a religious school or something and, you know, that's kinda obvious they're gonna read religious material.
L:  Yeah, I mean, like, that would be, like -- like, um, like even if they said, like, in public schools and stuff like that, like, I don't think they should make kids read, you know, like, things they don't want to or maybe things that --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- would go against like their beliefs or their faiths.  I think, um, in, like, some cases, like, you know, they should just, like, give the kid like an option or something like that, like, I guess in college it's different, you know what I mean, because you're --
R:  Right.
L:  -- actually paying for the courses and whatever but --
R:  It can kinda force you to read all the books --
L:  Uh, yeah.
R:  -- that they want. 
L:  I mean, you could always drop the course and stuff but I mean, like, um, I don't know, like, -- I -- I -- I never really went through that much of, like, you know, like being forced to read stuff, like, growing up over here.
R:  Right, I didn't --
L:  Um --
R:  -- either.
L:  No.  Where are you from?
R:  I'm from West Virginia.
L:  West Virginia, okay.  So, like --
R:  But I live in Charlotte now so it's a little different but [LAUGH] --
L:  So growing up in West Virginia did you ever, like, experience a lot of, like, problems of stuff like that like your parents disagreeing on --
R:  No, I mean, it really wasn't about that.  I don't really think so.  They just wouldn't let us read certain books but they didn't really say, "Well we're not gonna let you read certain books".  They kinda -- I guess they kinda kept it secret.  We're not gonna keep this kind of -- you know, we're not gonna read this.  It would be in the library or whatever --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, um, you know, and I guess maybe a rating system even of books or, you know, something like they do with movies maybe.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Some kind of, like, warning or something on some books that they think but, you know, there were a lot of books that were on the, you know, censorship list that I studied that they just did- didn't make sense to me and it's just, you know, different people's opinion, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Different -- different books might be off key for some parents for whatever reason.
L:  Like what -- like what's one of the books that you read about that you think --
R:  Um, you know, To Kill a Mockingbird.  That --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- that's one of the books that was on there.  There were some Sylvia Plath books --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think because she killed herself, you know.  Those were some of the books that, um, that were in there and I mean, some people are really interested in that kind of, you know, psychological books, you know, um, if you're studying like psychology or whatever and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you want to get to know more about mental illness or whatever and I guess they think well someone might kill themselves if they read something --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- by an author who killed herself, you know.  So --
L:  Yeah.  I mean it's -- it's almost kind of like the same deal with, like, the music thing and, like, a lot of people think, like, they should, like, censor a lot of music and stuff but I think it -- it depends on the person.  I mean, like, if a kid's gonna, like, decide to, like, start killing things after he reading, like, To Kill a Mockingbird or, you know to, like, just have a book affect them, like, in that way, then I mean, like, maybe, like, the parents should have, like, some kind of, like, maybe, like conference with the -- the teachers or something like that, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  Like I don't think they should tell the kid like, "Oh, you know, he's unstable or something like that".  I mean --
R:  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  I mean, I really don't know.  I mean, like, I've never heard of, like, any kid, like, you know, like, killing himself or anything, like, after reading a book.
R:  Over a book, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've never heard of that either and you know, saying it on songs too, I've heard of that but not books and I don't know.  That's just weird but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- even libraries really don't censor books, you know, in schools very often but sometimes you hear about it, you know, that they censor books from certain libraries and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I -- I don't know.  I just -- I really don't see the point in it because if you censor a book, that's just gonna make kids want to read it more.
L:  Exactly, that's --
R:  When they find out about it, they're gonna be like, "Oh, I'm not supposed to read this book so I'm gonna go see what this book's about" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and that's just encouraging kids to -- to read it more.  If they have freedom to read whatever they want, well they might just start it and say "I don't like it".
L:  Yeah, exactly.  That'd be like -- that's like the whole, like, rebellion factor of, like, censorship.  I think it's just, like, riles people up more, like, in general.  Whether it's like censorship of, like, books or movies or whatever, like, whenever people say, "Oh, that's censored" or you're not supposed to have that like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- even if they're not, like, children, sometimes, like, you know, like teens and young adults are, like, the same way, like , if they know that something's, like, forbidden or something like that, they just want it, like, even more.  You know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just to kinda like, you know, go against, like, the -- the flow of society or whatever.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, so I mean like in that sense, I mean -- I mean, I -- I agree with what you just said, like now I mean if they did, like, not censor stuff maybe the kids would be like, "Oh, well it's just a book.  If I don't like it, then, you know, whatever".  You know, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I think if something's on, like, a hot list or on a forbidden list of something like, you know, kids can't read, I think chances are they're gonna, like, read it themselves and, like, tell their friends and stuff like that.
R:  Right.  Now, did you go to public or private school?
L:  Oh, I've gone to public school, like, all my life and, um --
R:  Me too so I don't know if it's different private school, you know, about censoring books.  I -- I have no idea.
L:  Um, I took, like, one course in -- in college.  I went to, like, a private college --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, um, I read -- this is like my freshman year in, um, private college and the teacher just kinda like came into the room and he was like, "Well, you know, this -- the next couple of weeks we're gonna be doing a study and I -- I don't like doing the study but, you know, like, the -- the school pretty much tells I have to --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- do this" and the guy was basically saying we're gonna have to, you know, study some books in the Bible, you know, and I didn't have any problem with it at all but again, like, some kids were just like, "oh, God, oh" you know, just like they thought it was, like, the worst.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, and the guy was like, "Well, you know, I tried to get out of this but you know, it's like a part of the curriculum" and stuff like that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but I mean, in something like that, I -- at least in my opinion, this is just what like I say, like, I don't think they should censor something like that.  I mean, like, if the -- if maybe like a kid doesn't want to study that, I mean, he could, like, have the freedom to, like, drop the course.  I mean, it is --
R:  Right.
L:  -- college, you know what I mean.
R:  Yeah, and --
L:  But, --
R:  -- you're supposed to get a well rounded education, get different ideas.  You might not agree with the idea but at least you've read about it and you can --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, consider other ideas.
L:  Yeah, I mean, like, if somebody were to find, like, something, like, offensive or something like that in a book, like --
R:  Yeah, that's different.  Yeah, they can just drop it.
L:  Then that's different but I think with something like -- kinda like, um, like, with Harry Potter I can see like how, like, some -- some parents wouldn't like it because their kids maybe, like, really impressionable and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- like, they may not want to get their kids reading that but I mean, like a -- like studying books like -- like in philosophy and like the Bible and stuff like that, like, I think that's cool.  I mean, they can't -- from what I know, like at least over here, they can't, like, ban the Bible from school, you know what I mean.
R:  Uh-huh, right.
L:  I -- I think, like, some teachers, like, [inaudible] teachers they can, like, get in trouble if they have --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, their Bible, like, out on the desk 'cause it might be like --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- they're trying to, like, enforce their beliefs on students.  Yeah, it kinda goes back to the whole, like, no prayer in school thing they have over here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I'm guessing you guys have that in --
R:  Yeah, the same way.  I was a teacher for -- for a while.  I was a teacher for six months of first grade students.  We can't read anything like Easter, Valentine's.  I mean, it's really, really strict --
L:  Really?
R:  -- that -- the things that we couldn't read and it was just basically on the religious or holiday thing.  You can't read about, you know, religious anything.  Easter, you don't sing Easter songs, you know.
L:  Wow.
R:  It -- and that -- and that way the books are censored I guess.  You know, I haven't seen books being censored on, you know, we just don't like Harry Potter but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I've seen it in the religious, you know, but Easter and stuff kids need to enjoy --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- life, you know, and have a little bit of fun.  But the whole thing was just banned, basically movies and books and everything.
L:  Well, what grade did you teach?
R:  First grade.
L:  Oh, first grade.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Wow, 'cause it's been a while since I've been in first grade.  Like in first grade what I remember, like, about, um, like Easter and stuff like that, they would talk about, like -- well Christmas they wouldn't really talk about, like, the whole, like, religious aspect of it in school.
R:  Right.
L:  Like school would just mention, like, oh, you know, books about Santa Claus --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or you know, like, reindeers and stuff like that.  They wouldn't, like, men- mention anything about, like, Jesus or anything like that.
R:  Right, we can't do any projects on it or anything, any books.  Even, you know, if it didn't say anything about Jesus or anything.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  And I just thought that was -- that's really sad.
L:  Yeah, I mean, like, for me personally I think that's, like, kinda, like, sad.  I mean, like, it's up to the -- I think it should be, like, up to the kid to, like, decide whether , like, you know, he believes in the Bible or not.
R:  yeah.
L:  It shouldn't be like, "Oh, this is bad.  You can't -- you can't read this or this is like bad" because I mean it's gonna put like a bad idea in their head, you know what I mean?
R:  Right.
L:  Like I don't know.  It's just, like, my personal opinion I think.  Like, you know, some books, like, shouldn't be censored I think.
R:  Right.
L:  You know what I mean, if something is, like, not vulgar, or something's not gonna cause somebody to, like, you know, like, react in a negative way --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't think they should censor it, you know what I mean?  Like -- sort of like no prayer in school, like not having -- not being able to, like, take a Bible out in school.  I think that's wrong personally.
R:  Yeah, that's right.
L:  I mean, like --
R:  And certain shirts you can't even wear because -- but that's a different situation altogether than books but, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- anything censored and --
L:  I mean, I can understand, like, I say if, um, let me ...
