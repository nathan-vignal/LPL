R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello, my name is Randy.
L:  Uh, my name is Wilson.
R:  Hello, how are you?
L:  Yeah, okay.
R:  Good.  What was the question?  Do we think, sc- -- um, s- schools have a -- a right, uh, to require students to read certain books?
L:  Certain book while in private school did they say?
R:  Yeah.  I think this is pri- private schools.  Private or some other kind of schools.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I didn't hear it so well either.  But [LAUGH] --
R:  Well, you know, I was listening for other -- other things but--
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, actually I -- I do think -- I do think they do.  Da- -- um, for certain kinds of classic books --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, for certain kinds of history --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, uh, you know, books that will give them a -- a, um, [LIPSMACK] a -- a general education and teach them things that, uh, you know, universally our Americans really should know.  I do think that they should.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm. 
R:  What about you?
L:  Well, the thing is I don't -- I don't -- I am not sure.  The question you said was do -- do students have their -- what did you say?
R:  Do -- do, you know, does -- I guess basically this -- the -- the --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- uh, the system the government have a right to make, uh, students re- -- uh -- uh, require students to read certain books in school.
L:  Oh.
R:  And I think as long as they're not of a religious --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, nature --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, and they're not kind of government propaganda, I think that, you know, I, uh, I think that -- that there are books that should be required.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Certain books that should -- that give them a -- a, you know, certain, uh, a basic in -- in English language and, uh, and history of the co- -- or our country --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, things like that -- that -- that -- that they do need for everyday functioning.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think that -- I think those should be required.
L:  Well, I would think that too because, you know, we base on history about the past and the past that's what makes you what the future and the present, you know, what the present looks like and what progress we made in everything.  If they don't require those type of books, it would be like, you know, a history lost.  That's what --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- I would think myself.
R:  Right.
L:  And I -- what -- what I, you know, I don't know exactly, you know, some books they kind of, uh, they kind of prohibit students to read.  I -- I don't know exactly why but there are books that I consider even worse and they let [NOISE] for years they [inaudible] 
R:  Well, you know it's interesting that the subject is --
L:  Mm. 
R:  -- censorship --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which is the opposite.  You know, it's -- I felt that the question would be more in terms of what they can't read.
L:  Yeah.  That -- 
R:  And this -- this is not the question.  The question is what they have to read.
L:  Yeah.  That -- that -- that's what I -- that's what I would think too.  What they can't read because that would give you more room to discuss, you know, to -- [PAUSE] certain to, you know, to kind of try to find out what books they, uh, you know, like I said prohibit from them reading.  But did they -- I think all books are, you know, uh, all books are practically to me -- some books that can have, you know, uh, students acquire knowledge and everything because  even the paper you read and, you know, like, everything, you know, general knowledge.  Now even if you go and try to be like a teacher or something, they give you what we call general knowledge.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they base more or less on kind of, uh, [LIPSMACK] how, uh, you -- you know, like, uh, true, you know, story things that happened around the world.  So that's when if you don't read, most books, like, papers, magazines, and everything, so it's going to be hard for you to get to the point that to know the answers of these questions anyway.
R:  That's right.  That's how you -- I mean, that --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- is how you learn through the written word.
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  When you're very young and through your exposure to your family and to friends and people --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because you can't go and take off, like you said, you can't just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- go and travel --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so -- now -- so, if there are certain books that you are required to read --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's -- to me --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's okay, if, like I said as long as they're not making you read about --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  -- read about -- 
L:  Doing something --
R:  -- you know, with, like, brainwashing you.
L:  Yeah.  About -- 
R:  That's okay.
L:  -- faith or, you know, like, make you eat things -- like for example.  We had the bible, you know, you can't force anybody to read the bible --
R:  Right.
L:  -- if they have the Koran, you know, uh, things like that.  Some type of religious faith, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I don't know as it is like -- like I said, you can only know what the present is if you know what the past is --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and that's how you can base on the future because i- it's very hard, like, remember -- well, probably I don't care how old somebody is whatever -- yesterday looks like it's better -- it's better than today because things that happen every time people just keep pushing the [inaudible] and kids should know how things work.  Remember how things we're doing, our, you know, ancestors and, you know, everybody else like the -- our grandparents, our parents, you know, things like that.
R:  Right.
L:  So, that's mean, by books, that's how we can understand these things and if they require us -- required us to read these books and use them.  If they don't in school, like, I said, that would be a very, you know, a lost situation because how're you going to teach then to know the difference between the past and the present.  Uh, to me --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Right.
L:  -- that's how I think it is.
R:  This -- the only thing I would answer to this question is I, you know, I -- I don't think -- it's not a yes or no.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think it's -- the answer is very conditional --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- depending on what book.  If, you know, when they asked, "Do you think that so and so has the right to make children read certain books?"
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I think the ans- -- to me, the answer is, uh, yes depending on what the books are.
L:  Well, I would say that too.
R:  You know, I'm not going to say --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- yes or no.  I'm gong to say -- well, I'm going to say yes --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- but it depends on what the books are.  And --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- before I say yes, I want to know what they are.
L:  Yeah.  I would like to know too, because there are certain books, you know, like i- it -- it's like watching television some -- some, uh, you know, things some other -- some things on television you don't want your kids to watch --
R:  That's exactly right.
L:  -- and some books too, I think it's about the same for some books too.
R:  And sometimes there's too --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- ch- -- you know, at certain ages they're too young to understand --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they're frightening --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they're scary.  Where in a couple of years we're a little older they might understand the application of the book.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, um, you know, in history there's so many things that were very -- would be very frightening --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to someone who's s- seven years old, but when they're twelve, they may -- once, you know, they've already studied it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they -- and -- and -- and been -- it's been explained to them --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- even though it might have been a terrible thing that was done --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they already -- they understand what was behind it.
L:  Yeah.  Usually they can understand it better, as you say because, like, now kids and this is all, like, you teach kids and I say well, they can read whatever they can read now, and they can read later.  And that's what they go at progressively.  That's how you do things and you make them process it [several inaudible words] like I said, you know the questions was kind of a little bit awkward they way they asked it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's why I couldn't remember the question.
L:  Yeah, I couldn't remember it either because I was --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know, they usually when they have me waiting, when I am the first one they call --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- then you know I have a chance to listen to this question --
R:  Oh, do they call you?
L:  -- so when they said -- mm.
R:  Did they call you?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  See I got the email and I decided well, you know, let me call them --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because I have the option and this why it's on my terms.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So, I called them and first -- I don't know if I dialed the wrong number, but it rang, like, fifteen times and then it was busy.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I called back and I got them immediately and they said the subject is censorship.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, I sat here thinking --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- about it and then when the question came on I guess I was still thinking about it so I didn't really, uh, pay attention.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I -- when they said something or parochial school --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and my mind went d- --
L:  Blank.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- something to parochial schools.  It was too many things in the question,
L:  Well, you -- usually would have been, like, they could have talked about public school.  That would have been a better subject, [LAUGH] you know.
R:  I don't know, maybe they said public or parochial schools.  I really don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think --
L:  But is that -- was that -- is that your first call?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh.  So, I -- I -- I've been called before because usually sometimes they called you and they waiting, you know, look for somebody else.  And call --
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah --
L:  And call -- 
R:  -- that's what they did.  Wait -- they wanted to find someone else.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I actually did not know I was going to be calling on my regular phone.
L:  Oh.  Okay.
R:  And that they were going to ask if I was using a handset --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I had walked away from the phone -- I have my long cord on it --
L:  [LAUGH] Oh.
R:  -- and then I had to go back.  I was sitting comfortably in front of my computer looking at the screen so, oh, hold it, oh, I have to do this, and I --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- have to do that.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah, you have to get used to what they want.
L:  I --
R:  -- and they say well get to know the person like you're having a conversa- --
