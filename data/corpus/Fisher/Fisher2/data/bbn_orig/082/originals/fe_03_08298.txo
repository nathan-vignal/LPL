R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Hi, my name's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- Donna.
R:  Hi, [LAUGH] nice to meet you. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Have you done any --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- of these yet?
R:  [NOISE] I've done, like, one, and that was, like, ages ago. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Okay, I haven't --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- done any yet --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- so this is all new to me.
R:  Y- [MN] yeah, I -- I don't know. [LAUGH] so, I guess we're just supposed to talk about, um, censorship in private or public schools? [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, what was it?  Kids could read books --
R:  [NOISE] Uh --
L:  -- or kids should be required to read books?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, it was, like, um, should certain books, um, be required or not allowed in, uh, public and private schools.
L:  Okay, I didn't --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- quite catch it.
R:  Yeah, I think it -- it was just censorship, like, regarding, you know, books, basically. [LAUGH] So, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know, I think it's [NOISE] based on age, like, h- the maturity of those students that are being taught, really, 'cause I went to a private school [NOISE] and we basically could read everything, but that was because we were paying.  For public schools, I guess they can't usually read anything that, um, regarding religion and all that.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  So, I don't know.
L:  Yeah, I went to public --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- high school and, I mean, I don't ever remember it being much of an issue, but the one thing I do remember is, um, [SIGH] my social studies teacher, um, wanted to --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- use a text book that wasn't, um, a regular text book, so we had to buy the book [SIGH] and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there were, like, four cuss words in it and she had to --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- go through and X out each cuss word.
R:  Really? [LAUGH] 
L:  Yes. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Wow. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] So, like, in the book, you would come across these black markers, you know, and it was [LAUGH] -- it was just so funny --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- but she had to do that in order to be able to use the books.
R:  Wow, that -- that -- that's really interesting. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean, it [NOISE] -- I don't know, at my school we were, like, pretty free with what we got to read. [NOISE] I just always knew that [NOISE] boo- basically, you c- my counterparts that went to a public school, [LIPSMACK] like, they never had to take any religious course, like, ever, and I was like, "Hey, that's not fair". [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Why can they [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  'cause we were, like -- even, I went to, um, Jesuit, um, [LIPSMACK] university and [NOISE] [MN] one of the requirements was, um, theological courses, and, like, now that I'm transferring to a state institution, [NOISE] like, none of those [NOISE] courses matter. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  [SIGH] So, [LAUGH] I'm like --
L:  Yeah, I -- I went to, um, the University of Cincinnati which is a public, um, um, college, [SIGH] and [MN] chose to take, um, [SIGH] a couple of religion classes, but, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- yeah, nothing was required.
R:  [NOISE] Right.  So, I was just like, "Well, [LAUGH] okay". [LAUGH] I don't know, basically it's -- to me it's just, like, the maturity level of the students.  If they -- [SIGH] if a teacher feels that a student can handle it I think it's okay, you know.
L:  [SIGH] I was -- I was a little surprised.  I work with, um, kids --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- including --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- teenagers --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] at a couple of the high schools they get summer reading [SIGH] --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh.
L:  -- and, um, I was talking with one the girls about this summer reading stuff --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- this was last summer --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I thought --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that the one, uh --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the one book --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, there -- I thought --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it was awfully --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- mature for the kids.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, because it was about a rape and just a whole lot of other things and I just thought, [SIGH] you know, [MN] sometimes I think [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that people give --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- teenagers a little more of a level of maturity than they're ready for.
R:  [NOISE] Right. [NOISE] 
L:  I don't know, but then --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I like to shelter kids anyway [LAUGH] because I think they --
R:  [LAUGH] Right. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- learn too much too fast these days.
R:  Right. [SIGH] And I -- I guess, w- [NOISE] I mean, with reading and all it -- it requires a certain amount of imagin- uh, [SIGH] imagination or whatnot and, like, I don't know, I guess I'd rather that -- I don't know, read it and understand the gravity of it than watching it on [NOISE] television 'cause it makes it too easy for them. [NOISE] I don't know if you understand what I'm saying. [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, I've never thought of it that way, that's -- that's an interesting take on it.  You know, that you're right, television is -- it's easier to watch that, but to read it -- it -- it makes you think.
R:  Right, and, uh, I don't know, just, you -- like, [SIGH] when I watch something on the news, I'm just like, "Oh, [MN] [LIPSMACK] whatever" but if I read it in the papers it's like, wow, like, details and, [SIGH] you know, it makes me actually [SIGH] think it, understand the explicitness of it and why it's wrong and -- and [LAUGH] -- 'cause I guess they -- when they show it on TV they make it so, I don't know, like, extravagant and so -- I don't know, I -- I can't even explain it, but, I don't know, I'd rather read it than watch it.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, because --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- when -- I think when you see it on television it's not always as --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- real.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  Because, you know, you watch so many things on television, you know, if it's [SIGH] -- you know, judging Amy or, you know, one of the -- the night time, uh, news shows, but everything --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- is so -- [SIGH] so dramatized --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I think you almost become immune to it.
R:  Right.
L:  But when you're reading it, it's -- it's kind of --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it's a lot more powerful.
R:  [NOISE] Right.  That's [LAUGH] -- that's how I [NOISE] feel, so [LAUGH] [SIGH] there it is. [NOISE] I -- I certainly think that in, like, grammar schools and [SIGH] things like that, junior high schools, no, but, [NOISE] I don't know, maybe you see a lot of reading because [SIGH] once you get to college, the books that they give you, if you -- you don't have at least, you know, a certain amount of preparation for it, you're going to go in for culture shock once you get to college, I think. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, because, boy, the -- the reading, it -- it at least --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- triples.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, it -- like, [LAUGH] some of the stuff that I read in, [SIGH] um, [LIPSMACK] let me see, I think a -- was it a philosophy course? [SIGH] It was a religion course actually, so I guess there was a lot of use --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- to it, but it was just, like, [SIGH] televangelism and, like, um, snake handling and, [SIGH] you know, um, sacrifice and things like that.  If I hadn't, like, a certain amount of preparation when I was in my, um, high school, I would have been there like, "Whoa, I don't get it, I don't know how to write a paper or to better define what I read or anything like that, so"  [NOISE] 
L:  Wow, you -- you had some pretty wild reading [LAUGH] list.
R:  Y- [LAUGH] yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I would admit, yes, I did. [LAUGH] [NOISE] Yes, I did. [NOISE] I [MN] [NOISE] read things about, [MN] [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] let's see, [LIPSMACK] like, mysticism [SIGH] in, like, Native American cultures and, [SIGH] um, trying to think, um, like, Aust- I don't know if you've ever heard of Marion Zimmerman Brawley, but, um, it's basically [SIGH] a take on Australian legends, but it's very explicit, it has, like, [NOISE] sexual innuendoes and things like that, so  [LAUGH] 
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] [SIGH] So, I didn't know there was stuff like that out there until I read it, I was just like, "Hm, okay, [LAUGH] thanks". [LAUGH] [NOISE] And --
L:  Wow, that's -- [SIGH] that's something else. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] [NOISE]  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And teachers don't tell you to read [NOISE] stuff like that. [LAUGH] [SIGH] If they had -- if you can't handle it well, then, they tell you to leave. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, I remember I took a +philosophy -- a philosophy class on existentialism --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and, um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- some of the stuff I read just -- it really did go over my head, looking back on it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I -- I really tried to get my brain around it, [LAUGH] but, boy, [LAUGH] that was just --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [LAUGH] beyond me. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I [LAUGH] -- sounds sort of like philosophy, I hate that subject.  I feel like -- [SIGH] I mean, there's one thing, I never got any of that in high school, which is why I didn't feel I was prepared for it in college, but, like, [SIGH] reading about, was it, um, John Randall and, um, [SIGH] what is it, solipsism and, like, thinking if there's a reality -- you're in your own reality and that [SIGH] this is just my reality and not other people's.  Like, other people are in it -- like, their own different reality and I'm like, "What?"
L:  [SIGH] Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] "Like, I'm in a bubble? I don't get it". [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  [SIGH] I'm like, "Really?"  [SIGH] You know what, it's like, I don't know, [LIPSMACK] it -- it -- I felt -- I felt like I was in the Matrix, I was like, "What?" [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] "I don't get it. [SIGH] Did I take the blue pair or "  I'm just like, "Whatever, I'm not -- I'm not taking any more classes in philosophy, it really stinks[?]".
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  Maybe logic, but philosophy, no. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Well, it was, like, that or math classes, and I stunk at math. [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] So, my statistic classes are pretty okay, like, some -- some colleges k- uh, dean -- took some courses, they're, like, math courses, [SIGH] and a lot of that's at the computer, [SIGH] and computers have calculators, so  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Ooh. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] So, I was just like, "I'm going with that one". [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, I took a couple of stats.  It was just all the other math that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- drove me crazy, algebra, geometry, ooh. [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah, I hate calculus with a passion [inaudible].  Whoever created that should be shot. [LAUGH] Like, that's just horrible, that's a horrible thing to do to people. [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] I never got that [LAUGH] far. [LAUGH] 
R:  Calculus is horrible.  Like, you don't use it, there is no need for it in the job market, no need, unless you're [NOISE] going into, like, [SIGH] accounting and even then, like, it's a different type of, uh, logistic -- logistical math, it's not calculus.  I'm just, man, this course sucks, it's horrible, [SIGH] it should be banned. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] Engineers might disagree with [LAUGH] you. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] It -- it should just be banned. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] You should know if you want to be an engineer from birth, and then, you know --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- talked at from, like -- you know, reared that -- that knowledge when you were a child [SIGH] and the rest of us shouldn't be subjected to that kind of torture. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  So, are you saying tha, um --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- calculus should be censored? [LAUGH] 
R:  I hate [LAUGH] calculus. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] I can't stand it.
L:  [LAUGH] You know, like, those one, two [inaudible] what --
