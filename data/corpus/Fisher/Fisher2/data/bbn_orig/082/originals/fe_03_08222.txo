R:  Hello
L:  Hello.  [NOISE] 
R:  Hi, this is Davis.
L:  [MN] I'm Betty.
R:  Hey, what's up Betty?  [PAUSE] Doing all right?
L:  What?
R:  Are you doing all right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  All right.  Uh, they said the topic of the conversation is basically censorship in schools, like, basically talking about, like, if kids can read some books or not read other ones.  Uh, what do you think about that?  I can start off by asking you that.
L:  Well, I think to a certain extent there's some books that I feel that some of the kids shouldn't be reading.  How do --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you feel?
R:  Um, well, it depends.  I mean, like, I don't think that they shouldn't tell -- they shouldn't be able to tell kids, like, not to read the bible and stuff like that.  I mean, like --
L:  Oh, no.  
R:  -- that's, like, in my opinion I just think that's, like, something I, you know, it's like a personal faith kind of thing, you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, stuff like that, like, I -- I don't think they should, like, you know, tell kids that.  Oh, you can't bring your bible to school, 'cause, you know, that's against, like, the schools, you know, policies and stuff like that.  Like, that's just kinda like a personal faith thing, you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know.  I agree with you there.
R:  Yeah.  Ah, where are you from?  Are you from here in the city?  I'm calling from New York City.
L:  I'm in Wisconsin.
R:  Oh, okay.  See, like, over here they kinda have, like, strict rules on that, um, like, censorship and stuff like that.  Like, you, like, um, they make, like, a big, like, prayer in school -- in schools and things like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  How about over there?
L:  No.  Not in a small town.  We don't have, you know, any problems like that.  But I read about it in the paper and that where they really do, you know, other places.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I've never heard no uproar about nothing, you know.
R:  No.  What are the schools like over there?  Like, do they censor, like, a lot of things?  Or not really?
L:  No.
R:  No?
L:  No.  Mm-mm.
R:  Oh, okay, 
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  'Cause over here it's -- it's kinda lenient, I mean , like they don't -- they don't go off on the students, like, if, um, if they have, like, you know, like, comic books or something like that.  But I mean, it depends, like, um, like, there's, like, a big thing with, like, Harry Potter over here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  How, um, it says, like, some people are, like, oh, it's okay, you know, 'cause it's a children's book and it's about fantasy.  And then, like, some other folks who kinda, like, whoa, you shouldn't let your kids read that, you know, uh, because they're trying to sensor them from that saying that --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- it kinda like promotes, like, witchcraft and things like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I mean, like, do you agree with that?  Or ...
L:  No.  I don't.
R:  You don't?
L:  No.  
R:  Okay.
L:  I read a lot of crap when I was growing up and --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I don't think it affected me none.  [LAUGH] 
R:  No.  Oh, okay.
L:  Uh, you know what I mean.  I always loved to read that kind of stuff when I was younger.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, 'cause, I mean, it's stuff like that, I mean, it's that, you know, and schools they'll be, like, oh well, some- -- you know, they can't really, like, tell the parents, like, what they can and can't do.  I mean, like, they can suggest things but I don't they should be just, like, you know telling kids, like, oh, you know, you can't read that or, I mean, it's up to the parents eventually, you know what I mean?
L:  That's right.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  That's cool.  So, what do you think about, um, [LIPSMACK] like, them teaching, like, evolution and stuff like that.  Like, I know, like, a lot of schools, they try to censor that kinda thing, you know, like, um, just like trying, once again it goes back to, like, the whole, like, safe thing for some people.  Um, just try and teach it, like, they come from monkeys and stuff like that.
L:  Oh, I don't know.
R:  No.  Do they teach that, um, when you were, like, growing up in school?  Or they didn't, really, like, do that out in Wisconsin?
L:  No.  Not really.
R:  Not really?
L:  No.
R:  Oh, okay.  'Cause I know, like, uh -- 
L:  Actually I came from a real small colony, just a real loving school, you know what I mean?  Everybody loved everybody and [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- uh, I -- I give you example; my son is autistic; do you know what that is?  
R:  Uh, it's kind of, I'm not really sure if it's the same as Downs syndrome or not.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It is?
L:  Well, anyway --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- [MN] I should -- maybe I shouldn't be talking about this, uh --
R:  I don't know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [MN] well, anyway, uh, we lived in a bigger city and we came back to a small town and he finished school here.  And he did wonderful where he was really going backwards the other one, you know.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, that's the kind of school it is.
R:  Okay, good.  Yeah, I mean, it's -- it's pretty mixed.  I mean, it depends, like, if you send your kids, like, public school over here, like, it's just very free, like, they --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- don't really care much if they teach, like, evolution or not or things --
L:  No.
R:  -- like that.  You know, I guess, like, in the small town it would be, like, different than it is over here.  I've -- I've grew up in -- I've grown up in New York City, like, all my life so, I'm kinda just, like, used to, like, the way things are over here, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Um, well me personally, my opinion on, like, the whole evolution thing in school 'cause I know, like, um, when I was in high school, like, they would teach about that and stuff like that.  Um, it's kinda, like, it -- I guess you could say, like, the science teachers, they just tell 'em, like, what to teach and all like.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, for example, like, I had one science teacher that, um, [LIPSMACK] she was talking about, you know, the creation of the world and, like, how the big bang theory and all that stuff.  And, um, the school was pretty much open about that.  It was, like, you know, just teach that, you know, if anybody says anything just, you know, keep on teaching it.  You know what I mean, it's part of the curriculum, like, the ki- -- the kids can't really, like, protest or anything like that.  You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, and I remember, like, there was, like, one class in particular that, um, the teacher, she was just doing reviews of, like, um, for example, like, last week we were talking about the big bang theory, like, evolution and stuff like that.  Um, in one session she just, like, um, you know, was talking to the class and she said, "Um, can anybody tell me how the earth came about?"  And one person in that class just raised her hand and said, "Well, God created the earth".  And then the teacher kinda had, like, a nervous grin on her face and, like, "Well, w- -- yeah, but, you know, from out notes last week" you know, uh, she kinda got really nervous 'cause it's the kinda thing, like, you could almost lose your job over here for something like that.
L:  Yeah.  No.  My high school is not like that.  No, no, no.  [LAUGH] 
R:  No?
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  Oh, okay, over here it's like --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- they -- they can't really censor the teachers but they can censor the students.  Y- you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Have you ever dealt with anything like that?
L:  What?
R:  Uh, like, you know, like, growing up as a student or anything like that in schools?
L:  No.
R:  No?
L:  Mm-mm.
R:  Oh, okay, yeah.  Uh, well, over here that's, like, I -- some things in high school that I just, like,  dealt with, I mean, stuff like that, I mean, they just teach you , like, whatever it is and, I mean, it's just part of the curriculum so, I guess it's up to -- it's up to just , like, the school boards.  I mean, like, I say you can just, like, teach certain things but, I mean, you can't, like, force it down anybody's throat or anything like that.
L:  No.
R:  You know, out of school -- so, um, [LIPSMACK] what do you think about, like, other, like, ab- -- like, um, just stuff about, like, censorship in general.  Like abortion, things like that?  Like, going on back to the topic.
L:  You mean it's t- -- you know, you -- you mean teaching it after school?
R:  Oh --
L:  Talking about it after school?  Or ...
R:  Yeah.  Like telling kids about, like, you know, like, different ways of, like, you know, birth prevention, like, you know abstinence, abortion, things like that?  Like, do you think they should be taught in school?
L:  [MN] You know, I have to say, yes.  
R:  Yes?
L: 'Cause I have two nieces -- uh-huh, both are going to have a baby and they're not married and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- somebody should have taught 'em something.
R:  Oh, okay.  Are they pretty young?
L:  You know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.  They're pretty young, I'm guessing?
L:  Huh?
R:  Are they kinda young?
L:  Yeah.  One's fifteen and the other one is, like, [MN] sixteen.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  I know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you -- you wonder how this can happen when we're supposed to be educating, you know them [LAUGH] about all this.
R:  That's true.
L:  You know, so, if they just save one -- one from that happening and right, you know, just one child I guess you could say, baby having baby --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if they could just save one it would be worth the -- the class or something.  You know?
R:  Tha- that's true.  I mean, like, 'specially, like, in high school, I mean, like, they're not really, like, paying for their education yet.  It's not like college.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I think that's something that they d- definitely shouldn't censor is basically, you know, teaching about, like, abstinence, teaching 'em about birth control and things like that.
L:  Yes.
R:  [LIPSMACK] You know what I mean, like --
L:  No.  We never had this.  We never --
R:  No?
L:  -- had that.  No.  When we went to school.
R:  Oh, wow!  I mean, like, um, I kinda had that a little bit in, like, junior high school.  Like, they would mention things about, like, abstinence.  They didn't get into, like, you know, the whole thing about, like, condoms and birth control up until, like, high school.  Um, once again, over here, like, in New York City we have, like, a big problem with that, like, you know, like, a lot of teen pregnancy and things like that so, a lot of parents are just, like, boy, you know, you can't censor them talking about condoms.  You can't censor them talking about birth control or the big one over here's, like, abortion.  Like, people are, like, you know, oh, we shouldn't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- teach 'em abortion.  But I mean, like, it depends on the peoples opinions.  I mean, a lot of peoples' opinions are [LIPSMACK] basically, um, if you teach abstinence you won't have to teach 'em about, like, STDs or condoms or abortions 'cause, you know, they pretty much don't have to worry about that if they're just going to , you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- wait until they're married.
L:  And you know, to me the sad thing about this is that a lot of these are irresponsible because they are on drugs and the chances of have a child that's brain damaged or something, you know from that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's -- if just one could be prevented.   You know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because that's where our son [inaudible] out that you know, in a round about way this all happened.  You know --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- because of her drug use, you know.
R:  Oh.
L:  So --
R:  Yeah.  Th- --
L:  -- that's what I'm saying; they're irresponsible to begin with for that to happen.  It -- because they're probably on drugs, you know [MN] 
R:  Yeah.  That's -- that's what I think.  Mean it's kinda like, when I look at it, at least, like, in my opinion, it's just kinda, like, it's almost, like, selfish, you know, for, like, uh, lets say, like, a teenager to get themselves pregnant and not rally -- not really thing about the baby.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, it's just, like, well, you know, I gotta baby on me but I, you know, I gotta keep on living my life, you know wildly and stuff like that.  I mean, like, I don't think they give it much thought to the kid, I mean, like, how's the kid going to turn out?  Or what's going to happen to the child, you know, once they have it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is it going to grow up with, like, a father figure?  'Cause over here, like, they, um, [LIPSMACK] the schools over here, like, they -- they kinda, like, separate the guys and the girls and tell them, like, two different things, you know.  They mostly tell the girls, like, oh, make sure you have, you know, contraceptives and things like that.  And the guys, they kinda just tell, you know, like, oh, make sure you have condoms on you and don't, like, they don't push so much on abstinence.  They -- they -- 'cause they just assume that kids aren't going to listen.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, they just tell 'em, like, well, you know, you're going to do what you're going to do so might as well --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- do it safely.
L:  There just might be one that will listen.
R:  Hopefully.
L:  Like I say pro- prevent one retard[?], you know, wee brain, you know damaged child or [NOISE] one unwanted [LAUGH] child. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  No.  Absolutely.  I agree with you on that.
L:  Mm --
