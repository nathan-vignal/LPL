R:  [NOISE] Hey, this is Kerry.
L:  Hi, I'm Cindy.  How are you?
R:  Hey, doing good.
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] So, uh [MN] I thought it was -- I thought they said censorship and then I thought they said, "If students should be required to read certain books in school".  Is that what it was?
R:  [NOISE] Right and -- and it's [MN] can private or public schools um, I guess say what -- what they read.  What the students read.
L:  Oh.  Okay.  Yeah.  Well, that's -- that's an easy one for me.  I don't think that they can require um you know a student to read a book if the parents object to it.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, my -- my -- my family, we're -- we're strong Christians and there are some of the books that we object to --
R:  Right, it --
L:  -- and uh I -- I don't see my child getting a lower grade ah because there are certain books that I don't want them to have to be you know -- have to read.
R:  Right.  Um.  I -- I -- I -- I believe that there are ah, a lot of books in literature that for literature's sake and for that author's sake, um, it's good to read but --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- I'm with you.  Um, you know we're, you know a strong Christian belief and um, you know there are certainly some books that um if -- if we did allow perm- -- you know, permission for them to share in that -- I mean, of course --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- ya know we would um either read it with them first --
L:  Right -- right.
R:  -- you know read it at home first --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- you know before they would read it in school so that they already have -- you know have knowledge of the book and contents and know, um you know, how we would feel about it or you know --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- you know just so there's open discussion at home before, you know, the world's opinion --
L:  Right.
R:  -- would be brought in so to speak.
L:  You know, I can see having a recommended reading list --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and that's fine.  You know, "We recommend that the kids should read this.  We recommend this because we think it's got literary value" and -- and that's fine to recommend um, but as far as required um -- even to say it's a required reading list would be fine as long as it's understood that the parents have the right to say, "No, I don't want them reading this one" or "I object --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- to this book".  Uh, we had my oldest son when he was in the seventh grade, they were reading something that uh I had not seen and -- and it seemed pretty harmless but he objected to it.  It was a book about the Civil War and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it wasn't um -- it wasn't a historical book you know.  It was somebody taking quite a bit of licence with the -- the story and created a story and ah they were s- -- they said that they were setting it up to ah let the kids know what life was really like.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Um, and they started reading it in class every day a little bit and they came across several curse words and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- h- -- the teacher said of course that they wouldn't normally talk this way in school [NOISE] but these were the words from the book and they're only quoting the book and after all they did talk like this --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and my son came home and he said, "Mom, I -- I asked her if I could leave the classroom because you know, I don't like those words and we don't --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- talk like that and I don't want to hear those words --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- and she said that that was okay and she let me go in the library --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- and choose something else".  And so each day when they would read he would just leave, go to the library and read on his books --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he would be tested on that.  And I thought that was great you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but some teachers I'm sure would push it a little further.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I didn't object to the content of the book, but I obj- -- you know -- as he objected to the language, certainly I'm not going to tell my son, "No, you must listen to the curse words" [LAUGH] you know?
R:  Right.
L:  And I don't want the school saying that either.
R:  Right.
L:  Ah, when they're te- teaching uh subjects you know -- I -- I have a lot of friends that really enjoy the Harry Potter series.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I personally don't like it --
R:  Right.  I don't either.
L:  -- and yeah, and I -- my kids don't -- not reading it and -- and they haven't -- they haven't suffered any horrible fate [LAUGH] you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- from -- from having been left out of all of that and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, I just don't you know we -- we -- I just don't see the reason for it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Books are supposed to be creating a love for reading and a love for learning --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, but if you're forcing families into books that they don't want, I don't think that's gonna help the kids you know, get a -- a love for reading.
R:  Right.
L:  So I'm -- I'm against that.
R:  Ah yeah, I -- I -- I -- I have a kindergartener and so of course I haven't, you know, come a- -- you know, commenced to all this realm of, you know uh, required reading lists or -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- I mean al- although I mean at her level there really aren't any books I know of um that I would find questionable.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, I -- I -- I know that uh you know some -- i- if -- if it in- -- if it involves any type of you know -- if -- if somebody in the book is doing a ma- -- you know a magical spell or you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that sort of thing um, you know sometimes that can be questionable but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah 
L:  Well, you know they slip it in there um, and it seems harmless --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [MN] at first but kids don't really question what they're reading.  They're just reading it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and of course it's just like commercials.  It all goes into their little head [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know into that little head of theirs and -- and it muddles around and after a while they're begging for this particular cereal.  Not because they think the cereal will be good, because of the prizes in it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- a- and I think it's the same thing with books.  Um, they slip -- you know when I say "they" that sounds so paranoid but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the world in a sense really is determined to um change the thoughts of people and -- and make 'em be -- you know the word "tolerant" they love the word 'tolerant' --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they seem to be tolerant of everyone but Christians.
R:  Right.
L:  So they put their views into the books.
R:  Right.
L:  And uh, I don't know.  I have a problem with that and -- and like I said, I don't mind a recommended reading list at all --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I'm totally against saying that you have to -- you're gonna grade my child and say that he's not a good reader or that he's not able to comprehend a certain grade level because he didn't read the particular book you chose.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, he may be, you know, perfectly well able to read at that level but th- -- he doesn't have to read that book to prove it.
R:  Right.
L:  And I think school is supposed to be a place where they sh- -- you know they learn to read at a certain level.  It doesn't have to be a certain book.
R:  Right.
L:  And --
R:  And -- and what really cracks me up about it is uh you know, th- -- you know some schools they say you know, "You have to read such and such" --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know these are the same schools that you know -- that the boards are saying you know, the parents have to work hand in hand with the teachers --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but yet if the parents have an objection you know, then --
L:  Right.  They really do --
R:  -- you know.
L:  -- treat you like, "Oh my goodness" -- you know the eye rolling? [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Whereas soon as -- you know they say they -- like you said they -- they claim to want the parents involved but as soon as the parents become involved they begin to roll the eyes [LAUGH] you know?  So --
R:  Right.
L:  -- "My goodness, why do you have to come in here and say all this?"  But you know it's my kid --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and uh I did home school my children whenever we lived in an area that -- that we did not approve of the school system, we home schooled.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And as a matter of fact, this coming up year is going to be very strange for me 'cause it'll be the first year that I -- I think that I -- all the three of my kids have been in public school at the same time. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I've got one that's going to the tenth grade and you know, so I've got a high school, a middle school and elementary school --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and this will be the first time all of them have been in -- in hi- -- in school at the same time.
R:  Wow.
L:  But um, it just depends you know, and if -- as soon as I start having problems with a school to where they're forcing my child into Harry Potter because it's required now [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know I'm gonna have a problem with that.
R:  Right.
L:  I don't think you can -- I don't think you have to have Harry Potter particularly or this book particularly or that book to be --
R:  Right.
L:  -- able to show whether or not my child can read.
R:  Right.
L:  So that's -- yeah.  That's my problem with it.  It's not necessarily censorship so much as it is um personal choice.
R:  Right.
L:  And you know uh we -- when I was a kid they used to read the uh Little House on The Prairie books --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I love those --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but certainly if someone for some reason found that objectionable to their family --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- then I also wouldn't say that you should force them to read it.
R:  Right.
L:  So I think you know, they talk about choice -- they want everybody to have a choice and freedom and be tolerant --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- but they're not tolerant of that kind of thing.
R:  Right.
L:  And I have a problem with that.  Everyone's supposed to be uncensored except Christians and they want us to be censored.  And I don't like that.
R:  Right.  
L:  Its' j- --
R:  I know.
L:  You know, the stomping of the feet.  "It's just not fair". [LAUGH] 
R:  Right [LAUGH] 
L:  Poking out your bottom lip.  "It's not right". [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  Ya know, on the other side of the coin that -- the -- the question that it said was what about the school saying what, um, is not able to be read --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in -- in their -- you know on their reading list?
L:  Right.
R:  Um --
L:  Well, you know, as long as they tell me th- -- as long as I have the freedom to say what I will not allow my child to read, um then that's fine.  If they want to say they don't want the child reading this in school --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because they certainly can't -- can't ah control what my child reads at home --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, as far as reading lists and things like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, as long as they say, "We're not going to put this particular book on the reading list" that's fine --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- as long as I'm not forced to the ones that they've chosen also.
R:  Right.
L:  Um [NOISE] I don't think they'll ever put the Bible on the preferred reading list. [LAUGH] 
R:  Ah. [SIGH] 
L:  But I can't f- -- I can't even think of a book that's got more of everything you've ever wanted in a book.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, the intrigue, the excitement and the -- you know the mystery and the --
R:  Right.
L:  -- happiness and death, and no matter what it is it's there [NOISE] but they won't put that one on their -- and that's [SIGH] [NOISE] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know.  And my son's -- 
R:  Our pastor a- actually said in church yesterday you know, he held his Bible and said, "This is the um, the -- it's -- it's on the best sell -- it's -- the -- the Bible is like the number one best selling book of all time".
L:  Yeah and always has been.
R:  And -- and it get's to him that he sees all these kids --
