R:  Hello, this is Sharon.
L:  Oh, this is Joanne.
R:  Mm, where are you at?
L:  Well, I'm in the mid west.  Where are you?
R:  Ah, I'm in Illinois.
L:  Oh, really?  Well, you're -- you're -- you're not far from us, we're in Missouri.
R:  Oh.  Been there.
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  [MN]
L:  I'm having trouble hearing you.  Could you speak a little louder?
R:  Okay.  I'll try.
L:  Okay.  That's better [LAUGH].  And something may be wrong with my phone.  Um, so we're supposed to talk about public schools ah banning certain books? 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Is that your understanding?
R:  [MN] Yeah, I -- I just couldn't un- -- I couldn't hear too good but I figured the, you know, who I'm going to talk to may be heard better, so --
L:  Yeah, well, that's pretty clear what -- what she's -- to me, what she said.  Do we -- do we a- think that public schools have the right to ah prevent students from reading certain books?  But she didn't say what books.
R:  No.  Well --
L:  So, I -- I think that -- the -- that the answer to that question is really important [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Well, it -- yeah, that depends on what kind of books they are, if it's like a, you know, a X rated book, I would, yeah, they have the right to prevent them from reading 'em.
L:  Oh, definitely.  I mean, I -- I don't know how far you would go to prevent something like that, it -- it's possible that -- that um -- um, it's just possible that -- that they wouldn't have them in the school library, but I don't think they could do anymore than that.
R:  No, no, they -- they can't do anything about 'em reading them if they're outside the school.
L:  Right.
R:  But on school grounds, that -- what they do then --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, doesn't concern the school.  They're -- they're not in charge of them then.
L:  Well, I think -- I think that's the parents' job, really.
R:  Yeah, but -- but for in school, if they're in school, yeah, they should be able to stop 'em.
L:  Mhm.  Well, or at least not -- not have them in the school library.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I don't think they would have them in -- I'm not -- haven't been in the school for a long time, but I don't think that they would have them in the library where they could check them out --
L:  Oh no, I doubt.  Um, there -- there was something in the newspaper recently about um oh, Harry Potter books.  The --
R:  Oh yeah?
L:  -- yeah, and um there was some other books that were written for young adults that oh one local school didn't think the children should read, even though --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- even though they were widely read --
R:  Yeah.  Now, I don't know, yeah, I did -- there was something in -- in the email about Harry Potter.  It had to do with religion --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know and it was some people -- some church, I don't know, you know, that that was a atheist -- an atheist ah thing and that I don't think it's -- you know, that it does, you know, like fairy tale --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't think it has anything to do with what they were trying to imply.
L:  Well, I think of the Wizard of Oz.  It had witches in it and [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  -- and magic and -- and um, my goodness, it's a classic.
R:  Yeah.  So, I don't know, maybe that's a [NOISE] you know, what they were talking about --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- yeah.  Um, [MN] --
L:  Do -- do you have some noise in the background?
R:  Oh, I -- I was frying chicken and I just took the lid off to turn it --
L:  Oh.  Okay.  [LAUGH] I heard that sizzling.
R:  Yeah.  I didn't want it to burn while I'm on the phone.
L:  Well, no.  My goodness.  They call -- they call at -- sometimes inopportune moment. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  But um, yeah, that -- because that -- that's all -- all I could -- I can't think of another book that I've heard about --
L:  Well, I -- I can't either, actually.  So, it's -- it's um, it's not something that comes up real often --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I haven't had any children in school for a long time, but when I did they um -- they never had any banned books in their schools --
R:  Yeah, no, yeah, my kids have been out for a long time too and I don't remember them ever having anything about a book -- any books when they were going to school.
L:  Well, I -- I -- I have to say it could be in -- it could be a big issue, but I don't think it is.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Not a -- not at the moment, anyway.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I -- I don't -- I know some people that -- that they just love the Harry Potter books, they adults, they can't wait for the next one to come out when the --
L:  Oh, really [LAUGH]?
R:  Yeah.  I have -- I have bought the movie for my grandson, the first one --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because he wanted it and I watched some of it, but I didn't see anything wrong, you know, in it, it's just ah, you know, kids like to watch that kind of stuff.
L:  Well, it could be a cartoon.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or it could be Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs or [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's -- it's um --
R:  Yeah, well some people find um find stuff wrong in the -- some of the cartoons too, they say that it's, you know, like -- they find X rated stuff.  I watched ah I've seen the cartoons that they were talking about, they're more the old classic ones --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I've never seen anything in there.  I don't know what -- I think they make it in their imagination themselves.
L:  Well, I do think -- I do think that cartoons, at least some that I saw in the past, have been pretty violent, but they are --
R:  I'm no- ah, yeah, I'm talking -- I wasn't talking about the new ones, these were, you know, movies of cartoons -- or cartoon movies with --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- well, the animated characters that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [inaudible] stuff bad in them --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and [MN] I had seen them when I was a kid and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- never [inaudible] nothing bad.  My kids watched them, I didn't see anything.  But you'd have had to really look good, well, somebody had a, you know, bad imagination and they just [MN] imagined, you know, this.  I suppose you could do that, looking at a cloud and thinking it looks like something else.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  I don't know who's going to be looking at the clouds if you're watching a cartoon.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I watch the, you know, little [inaudible] --
L:  Right.  Well, I -- I um -- I wonder if -- why they asked that question?  I'm sure they had a good reason.  But --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it -- it just -- it's -- it's hard, it's hard to discuss because there's so little to say [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, I do believe they have the right if it's -- if it's inappropriate and um and there should be a clear cut decision as to what is inap- inappropriate, or a definition --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- be -- before trying to -- to do that.
R:  Yeah.  There -- there was something -- another book a little while back, I don't remember just what it was now, but they -- they had it in the school and it was like it was, you know, a true story, it was somebody that had been in trouble and -- and they didn't like some of the language that he used in  --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- this book and they were trying to ban that book from the school.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um ... but I think in the end I -- I think that, you know, that it came out that they couldn't do it, so it was still allowed.
L:  Well, I'm sure it does come up from time to time, I'm sure it would.  Ah --
R:  Yeah, well this was in the high school --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and -- and the kids in the high school have all heard, you know, bad language and --
L:  Oh, you bet they have.  All they have to do is watch Cable television.
R:  Yeah.  And a lot of them uses it like everyday language too.
L:  Mhm.  I know.
R:  So, I -- I didn't see what the big thing was about the high school.  But --
L:  Well, I know I um -- I lived overseas for five years --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um and when I came home about five years ago um, turned on the television, I couldn't believe what I was seeing and hearing [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm. [LAUGH]
L:  It -- it had changed a lot.
R:  Mm.
L:  But that -- that's nothing to do with books, but it does have to do with language and wr- and writing.
R:  Yeah.  But ah with the television, I just feel, you know, if you don't like what's on you could turn the channel.
L:  Well, that
