L:  [NOISE] Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, this is Paula.
R:  Hi, I'm Sarah.
L:  Hi.  So our --
R:  Hi. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- topic is [NOISE] censorship and she asked if we thought private or public schools have the right to censor materials [SIGH] and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I believe they do for children. [NOISE] 
R:  For children up to what age?
L:  [LIPSMACK] For children up through junior high --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- school I would think, although libraries, even now, [NOISE] censor some materials.  They don't allow Playboy for instance --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so you know for children I think I'd be against [NOISE] too much and I certainly would be against censorship -- against them [NOISE] taking certain books off the shelves --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- but [MN] I think you can make an argument that you don't want pornography --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- so I guess it's [NOISE] relevant what materials they're talking about. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.  I feel like it -- there's a lot of questions that need further explanation before I could come up with an answer [NOISE] because --
L:  Right.  Because overall, I don't believe in censorship and I get the [NOISE] sense that you don't either.
R:  No. [LAUGH] 
L:  No.  But we do if -- but if somebody said, "Well, what about --"
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  "-- pictures of you know, naked men beating women?" you'd say, "Well, no I wouldn't want that".
R:  Exactly.  But it's so hard because then you have [SIGH] -- you have the schools where they don't want certain works of -- of literature --
L:  [NOISE] That's right, which --
R:  -- read because it's --
L:  -- I would be against.
R:  -- which I find unbelievable because --
L:  [MN] Right.  Or certain scientific theories [NOISE] taught because they think it goes against the Bible.
R:  Exactly.
L:  [NOISE] Yes.  So tho- -- it is a problem.  Um [LIPSMACK] I'm actually a librarian and censorship is a big [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- is a big issue and these things come up all the time.  [SIGH] It's almost better to say, "No censorship" but parents would be outraged if there was --
R:  None.
L:  -- [MN] somebody not at least guiding the ship but I -- I think [MN] less is better.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it would have to be just [NOISE] things very obvious.  And many children's books, even little kids' books like -- I'm trying to think of that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- Mickey And The Moon book or something where it looked like he was almost --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- naked but not really.  Some librarians took that away and there was a big uproar --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- and Catcher In The Rye has been banned.  Huckleberry Finn has been banned.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I'm certainly against all those type issues.
R:  Yeah.  I mean it -- it definitely depends on, I think, the age group --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and what you're trying to teach them.
L:  Exactly. [NOISE] 
R:  Because I read Watership Down in high school --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I obviously would not allow a child of five or seven or nine or --
L:  Right --
R:  -- to read that.
L:  -- -s funny, my mother just brought that up because --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- she thought it was too old for smaller children because it would be too frightening.
R:  It's -s -- yeah.
L:  And I think that that's probably right but I -- I don't think that stuff really happens very often in school.  That they give inappropriate [NOISE] materials --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- to little kids.
R:  No.  We got like [LIPSMACK] -- I mean I went to Catholic school till eighth grade and then I went to public school beyond that --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] and we basically got the standard reading material in high school. [MN] Grade school you know, it's just book report stuff and --
L:  Right --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they don't -- the question is not letting them do things too young but do they [NOISE] you know eliminate things that might be good for fear of offending someone --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think it -- to more the other direction.
R:  But then you can eliminate everything. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh [LAUGH] are we allowed to change the subject?  Where am I talking to at? [NOISE] 
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  I said, "Are we allowed to change the subject?"  Where are you calling me from? --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- or where are you living?
R:  I'm in Philadelphia. 
L:  Oh, I'm in Pennsylvania too.
R:  Oh.
L:  Up in the um -- up above Scranton.
R:  Oh okay.
L:  I'm sorry; I'll get back on the subject.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Kind of curious though. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I grew up in North Jersey though.
L:  Oh.  Well, I grew up --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- in Massachusetts.
R:  Oh. [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] So. [NOISE] Well, this is my first call.  Is this your first call or --?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah. my first call too.  I wonder if they match 'em first first say.
R:  Yeah, I don't know.  My roommate came down, said, "I can hear the phone".  I'm like, "Wait ten minutes.  Take a shower". [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah it's not that long of a time.  I couldn't remember after I --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- signed up how long the time was supposed to be.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] But censorship is a big topic --
R:  It is [MN] --
L:  -- for a ten minute [LAUGH] phone call.
R:  -- it is.  And like, I personally feel that censorship is more of a prevalent issue in [SIGH] like music and in the whole [SIGH] idea of separation of church and state [SIGH] --
L:  Right.  
R:  -- when it -- 
L:  I actually hadn't even thought of music but you're you know, a- a- at -- when they asked, but you're right.  Of course that is an issue too.  Well, I think parents have a right to supervise and [NOISE] censor what their children read although I try not to.
R:  Yeah.  When I was younger my parents, you know, definitely -- I think my -- my parents were more concerned with [MN] what I listened to as opposed to what I read.
L:  Yeah.  Me too.
R:  And that's hard because as a [NOISE] parent you go by what other parents tell you and what other adults tell you so you might not have the most informed decision.
L:  Right.  Or what you --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- read in the Catholic --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- newsletter like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- my mother used to do --
R:  Yeah
L:  -- for the movies. [SIGH] [LAUGH] 
R:  Exactly.  My mom came back from a meeting with a priest and he was basically like [SIGH] -- it was when all the -- the quote unquote devil worship --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh right.
R:  -- was rampant.  So I wasn't allowed to listen to stuff like Motley Crue and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I think David Lee Roth because of the one cover of his album [NOISE] --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- which, these days, [NOISE] is absolutely ludicrous. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  I know.  It -- it's --
R:  Because --
L:  -- it's true. [LIPSMACK] 
R:  -- you know it's nothing compared to you know what they --
L:  That would be a more interesting topic.  Sort of --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the history of censorship and how much --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- things have changed and how freer really --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- things are --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- now than they used to be, but yeah.  I never tell my -- I have three children and I never tell them, "You can't read that or you can't read this" but I might if I, you know, [SIGH] found something that I was really offended by but -s just never happened.
R:  Yeah.  I'd -- I haven't -- there's nothing that I've really read ever where I've -- I've been like, "Wow.  You know children shouldn't read this.  I've no idea why I read this so young" and we read [SIGH] -- I mean, like I said, we didn't really read anything that was too racy.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it might have been because of the school district I was from.
L:  Yeah well, we --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- didn't either --
R:  But I mean -- 
L:  -- believe me.
R:  -- I don't really think -- I feel like it's almost like this contest to find as much things as you can possibly find quote unquote objectionable that --
L:  That may be true for some people.  That they're always looking --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- to find fault and --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- get rid of something because everything offends them.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Especially people that are um ultra religious.
R:  Either ultra religious or ultra atheist, 'cause then you have the people --
L:  Oh yeah, the opposite um approach.
R:  -- yeah, who sit there and basically want, "In God we trust" taken off the money --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and you know stuff that's in, say, schools for ever and ever and ever, like the Tablets of the Ten Commandments.
L:  Exactly, which I'd be against.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But that seems almost like a sub category of censorship to me.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But it does fall under the --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- same -- the same heading.  You're right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah we could go on forever with this topic.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Hope we're bringing up all the high points though.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Exactly.  It's like figuring out how to spin it different ways for ten minutes. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah, but it's true.  We have brought --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- up all the high points.  In fact I think we're doing an excellent job [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- of covering the topic. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] Yeah, right.
L:  I once had to take a class on censorship and a lot --
R:  Really?
L:  -- yeah, as part of my library st- -- um [LIPSMACK] in Boston at graduate school and [SIGH] it was um, a very interesting course and we'd have different speakers come in.  We had somebody --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- from the ACLU and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and we'd have somebody who --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, they -- they're very against censorship but --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- of any kind --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- and then you'd have people that would have an argument for pornography and it -- the truth is in this country --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- pornography is not allowed in libraries [NOISE] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and if it comes --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- up now with this whole -- we haven't touched on the whole internet thing [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- then they tell people they have to stop doing it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But they haven't filtered it out, although I guess that's coming and there's a big public debate brewing about that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- at the moment.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] So that's -- I don't know how that can be --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- stopped but --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- I think people do and know -- like a kid's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- know they're doing the wrong thing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but that counts too.
R:  Yeah.  I mean it's hard because then you also run the risk of what these children actually understand.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, like when I was younger I said, "This sucks" and my dad was like, "What?" --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- "Do you know what that means?" and I was like, "I dunno -- it means it stinks" you know?
L:  Right.  Exactly.
R:  And he was, "Don't ever --"
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  "-- use that word again" --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- but like it's sad because you pick up [SIGH] an expression and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, but do you really know what it means?  Like I [NOISE] -- I'll listen you know all the hair bands from the eighties and I'll laugh because I used to [NOISE] listen to that crap and my parents used to let me listen to it and most of the lyrics are like sexist and degrading to women and just --
L:  Right but you were unharmed by it. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, and I had no idea and now I listen to it and I'm like, "Oh, my God".
L:  [NOISE] It's like somebody asking me if I thought the kids ever -- you know, why ever teenage boys look up pictures of naked women on the internet and I said, "Well, I don't know but I assume they all do it once or twice".  I mean that would be normal, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Except that I'm not bringing it up [LAUGH] that's for sure.
R:  No.
L:  And I have the computer upstairs --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- in a fairly public location.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't question them closely about it --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- but I feel that it's there and we're here and you know they can't get up to too much trouble.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  And you can't --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- I remember telling my parents that there's only so much that you can monitor and I remember telling them the example you know -- I wasn't allowed to listen to Motley Crue because of like the one album cover and their whole Shout at the Devil thing so, what do I do? 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I get the tape from my friend.
L:  Right.  Well, I'm --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- older than you but when -- for me it was Woodstock. [NOISE] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  My parents were like shocked and outraged.  Not only that, they actually bought it for me as a gift 'cause I put it on my Christmas list -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and then my father was like outraged [LAUGH] --
R:  I can't believe this.
L:  -- and -- yeah he --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- took it away and said how dare I and I remember I thought, [NOISE] "Oh what a big deal about this" you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  It was really nothing in the scheme of things --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- even then it was really no big deal to me --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- but it was a very big deal to them.
R:  No, and I find that sometimes especially with like censorship and stuff it comes to the point where it's not a big deal and kids might not think it's a big deal and then when all this, like, ruckus is caused because of we can't read this, we can't allow this in our schools, we can't do this, we can't do that -- then all of a sudden it makes them want to read it.  [NOISE] It makes them want to find out why it's forbidden.
L:  Well, that's definitely true --
R:  You know?
L:  -- I mean you're just calling attention to it then.
R:  Exactly.  Like you're telling these kids you know, "You -- you shouldn't read this, you shouldn't read that".  I forget, there was some book a while ago [NOISE] that [NOISE] I remember hearing was banned and I just didn't understand why.  And I was like, "Maybe I should reread it now that I'm older", you know?  Maybe I would understand why but [SIGH] --
L:  Like Mary Poppins.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I'm a fan because sh- -- well, she had never seen black people for -- some of her descriptions of Africans were offensive but in its time --
