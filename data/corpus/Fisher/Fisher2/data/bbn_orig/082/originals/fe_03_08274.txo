R:  Hi, I'm Alyssa.
L:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] Hi, I'm Shirley.  How are you?
R:  Good.
L:  Good.
R:  [NOISE] Oh [SIGH] so today's topic is [NOISE] whether or not we believe -- I didn't completely catch it -- the ball --
L:  I didn't either. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] All I under- --
L:  [LAUGH] That's why I was waiting.
R:  -- private --
L:  Something about private schools.
R:  -- private schools and reading certain books --
L:  [LIPSMACK] [MN] 
R:  -- if they allow 'em 'cause like you know, I know that some private [NOISE] schools they've got certain um, [NOISE] like the regulations on the books that they can and can't read.
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH] [NOISE] I don't know.  I think that if the parents really want 'em to read the books [NOISE] that they'll let 'em read 'em at home regardless if the school wants them to or not. [NOISE] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] I agree completely.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Because I mean --
R:  [NOISE]  Shh. [NOISE] 
L:  -- but you know a lot of --
R:  [NOISE] Shh. [NOISE] 
L:  -- some books they don't want them to read --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- because of heritage.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah well, but it's -- I think it's just some of the parents that get on the school board, they just say, "No, we don't want those books being read" and it's like [SIGH] [NOISE] I don't know -- I don't -- [NOISE] a lot of these books that I see they're kicking [NOISE] off the thing, it's like I don't even understand why.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] 'Cause I've heard like they cou- -- they ah [NOISE] -- some of them like [NOISE] was like Tom Sawyer [NOISE] some of the schools wouldn't [NOISE] let 'em read and it's like, "Why?" 'cause they use the -- [NOISE] [SIGH] I don't know.  The word that they use in there is the main reason but I don't see why.  [NOISE] It was part of our past.  It's what was used.  [NOISE] They should know it. [NOISE] 
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  As you can see this is --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- my first phone call.  I don't really --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- know what to say. [LAUGH] 
R:  This is my second one.
L:  Oh really?
R:  Um, I waited to accept another one until I got my check and I did receive a check so [NOISE] -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- but they just basically want you to just to talk.  [SIGH] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Talk about the topic.  Give your opinions.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Tell them what you think. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] Going to be a long ten minutes. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]  It does -- it does -- it -- like my first phone call it did.  It's like [MN] I -- at first I thought, "Oh wow, this is going to be really long" but it's not. 
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  It like will fly.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It will.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  No, but I know that some of -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- when I was in school, I -- I never -- I don't remember them ever saying anything --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- about --
L:  No.
R:  -- certain books I couldn't read or could read.  I never remember them saying that, "You can't read this book or you can't have this [NOISE] book". [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah.  I remember -- well, I remember when I was at school I remember one --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- book being ah taken out and that was Little Black Sambo.  That's the --
R:  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  -- only book that I know from when I was going to school that they [NOISE] -- 'scuse me -- took out of the library.  [LIPSMACK] But other than that I'm sure there was others but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- even at that, you know, I don't even know why they took that out.
R:  I've no --
L:  Oh I guess the only reason they took that out was because of the word "black" in there you know.
R:  See the- they really -- I know 'cause like what in Tom Sawyer [MN] they use the other word that they used for black.
L:  Right.
R:  I don't like using that word so I'm not going to repeat it but [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [SIGH] but yeah.  I mean they -- they did have some foolish reasons as to why you know they take some of these books out but I -- I -- I personally I [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] I don't know.  Public schools are a little more the len- lenient as to --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the -- what they allow them to read and such.  I've never personally been to a private school. [SIGH] Nor have I really looked into 'em so I can't say really as to my knowledge on --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- how strict they really are --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, my --
R:  -- with their reading.
L:  -- my kids has been out of school so long, I can't remember [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] And I -- I gra- --
L:  -- that far back. 
R:  Yeah.  I graduated like eight years ago so i- it's been a while. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Well, I graduated a long longer than that. [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I got grandkids. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] [MN] 
R:  No.  I just know that they --
L:  [NOISE] [MN] 
R:  -- the schools they've changed a lot.  I know that.  I mean especially with all these --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- this violence and everything and all these kids going around with their guns and everything.
L:  Mm.
R:  I think there's --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I think they're really -- they're really changing.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I mean my school, you used to just be able to walk in the door and no problems, carefree and now, all of a sudden, it's like [SIGH] you gotta go through a metal detector [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I live in a small town.  I mean, my graduating class was like a hundred and eighty. [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And now all of a sudden you gotta go through metal detectors to get there.  And I just don't think that's right.  That's just -- it's not fair.
L:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] No it's -- it's not right.  [NOISE] But then again it -- it goes back -- but you know what? [LIPSMACK] They take -- taking [NOISE] certain books out --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- because they're saying it --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- causes -- it's like causing violence. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah. [LIPSMACK] But it's just like they're saying to music and it's like, "I'm sorry but it's not.  It's the parents".
L:  Right.
R:  It's the parents' lack of knowledge of what their children are doing.  They're not paying attention to 'em.  They're not listening to 'em.  They're not watching what they're doing, who they're hanging out with, what their friends' parents are like, the influences that they have when they're not at home.
L:  [MN] 
R:  And they say, "Oh well, this day and age everybody's gotta work twice as hard" and it's like, [MN] so what?  My mom -- single mom -- raised three kids and she kept us out of trouble.
L:  Right.
R:  I don't see why uh parents that are married -- both of them are working -- why, you know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they don't know what's going on. [NOISE] 
L:  I don't know either and you know [SIGH] you say both parents working, [NOISE] whether you are working in the home or out of the home you're both working --
R:  Yup.
L:  -- and you know, [NOISE] it's like you say it goes back the con- -- to the control and not listening.
R:  Yeah.  And then they try to blame it on --
L:  And sometimes I think sometimes the schools listen a little too much.
R:  [SIGH] They read into things way too much.
L:  Right. [SIGH] 
R:  Way too much, in the wrong areas to boot. [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] [LIPSMACK]
R:  [MN] 
L:  Sound like you had a little one there.
R:  [SIGH] I have a two and a half year old.  Sh- -- well, she's almost three.  She'll be three next month.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  So, it is, it's kinda scary to think you know, it's like [MN] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I feel that I a- -- I know, you know I'm gonna very involved in her education and I wanna -- you know?  I'm gonna make sure it's well rounded and she knows --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, what to do and what not to do.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Granted she might still do it even though --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- she knows not to do it but --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I know that I'm at least do my --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- [MN] damnedest to --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- make sure she --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- knows [LAUGH] what's right and wrong.
L:  [MN] [NOISE] 
R:  'Cause in all honesty, I mean it's not --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- really the parents' fault --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- even if they're out there reaching out, trying to tell 'em, give 'em all the information that they can have, there's only --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- so much that we can do. 
L:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] 
R:  It's just basically you have to instill in them to know that even though Mom and Dad aren't right over your shoulder you still have to, you know, be mature enough to say "No" --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, that --
R:  -- and not do it.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] well, that goes -- goes back to [LIPSMACK] -- to [SIGH] like in -- like in the schools, if the teachers aren't allowed to discipline them anymore.  [LIPSMACK] Like when I went they could spank and nowadays they -- they +can't.
R:  Yeah -- yeah.  My ah -- 
L:  I mean that --
R:  -- my mom actually --
L:  -- that too you know.  They took that out of school.  They take books out of school.  It's -- [NOISE] I don't know.  Ye- [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, it's just getting so -- it's getting too hard.  'Cause I know that when I went to school, even when I was in elementary they couldn't spank either, but my mom -- I was, I mean I was a little honey and I'll admit it but um [LAUGH] -- my mom actually gave the teacher and the principal permission to spank me because I was being such a trouble maker.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [MN] She said, "Haul off and smack her on the butt if she needs it.  It's 'bout the only thing that keeps her in line". [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] [MN] [NOISE] 
R:  [MN] So --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- yeah.  [NOISE] [PAUSE] 
L:  [PAUSE] [NOISE] 
R:  I don't know.  It's scary though to think you know it's like that y- actually --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- have to let 'em go.  I actually work with a girl right now.  She's sixteen and she's home schooled.  She's got --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- ah three younger brothers --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and a younger sister --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and they go to regular schools.  She's the only one that's home schooled --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just by choice.  They used to be but she chose to stick with it and the rest of 'em wanted to go to school [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- and I mean --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- she says you know -- she gets in --
L:  You can tell the difference in the way she is? [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, she --
L:  I've never been around --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- anyone that was or knew -- 
R:  She's -- she's very mature.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Very mature.  Very intellectual.  Very smart.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I mean you could still tell, you know, she's -- she's only sixteen --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but you can -- you can tell you know, she's still a sixteen year old but yet you can also --
L:  Like she controls her mind more than letting other people?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  She's -- I mean she just -- she reaches out there you know and [LIPSMACK] just to carry a conversation -- I went there, I look at her and I'm like, "How old are you again?" [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- the things that are coming out of her mouth.  I'm just like, "I have friends that are older than you that don't talk like that, honey". [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] It's -- it's -- it's weird.  I used to live next to someone else that they -- she home schooled her two sons --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they were -- they were little -- they were little smarties.  They just -- it's like they caught onto things quicker and better and just had more rounded knowledge.
L:  [MN] Probably had that more that one on one --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- made a difference.
R:  Yeah.  It did.  You know, it's like --
L:  [NOISE] I know when I went --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- to s- -- when I -- well.  Tell you what size my school was.  There was twenty three in my class at graduation. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Okay, that's -- that's small. [LAUGH] 
L:  That is very small and even then [NOISE] it --
