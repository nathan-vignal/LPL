R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] Hello.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Hi, my name's Sheryl.  I'm from New Jersey. [NOISE] 
L:  Hi, my name is Roberta.  I -- I live in ah Massachusetts. [NOISE] 
R:  Nice to meet you, Roberta.
L:  Aye.  I'm an original New Yorker. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, are you really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] Whereabouts?
L:  [SIGH] I grew up in the Bronx.
R:  Uh-huh, okay.
L:  Yeah, and actually [NOISE] my parents live in New Jersey now. [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, neat.
L:  In Marlborough.
R:  Oh, not too far from me.
L:  Oh, great [MN] -- great.
R:  Yeah, very nice. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] 
R:  [NOISE] So, let's see, um --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- sh- shall I start? [LAUGH] 
L:  Sure.
R:  Okay.  Um, I actually work in publishing so this is a great question for me. [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Whether schools should uh censor what -- what kids read.  I -- I absolutely believe they should not censor what kids are reading.  [SIGH] Ya know that they are now and I know part of the -- ah, the way that school boards adopt a book is they sit and they read through materials --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- with a --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- check list looking for certain things in the books and, if certain things are there or not there, they make their decisions -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- based on that.  And I think a lot of great classics and a lot of great textbooks have not gotten through to the students because of that.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Right.  I -- I don't know if it's more prominent in public school districts or private school districts because I -- actually, I'm a speech pathologist and I work in the schools [NOISE] --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- so ah, [SIGH] it's very interesting to see what the kids are reading.  And I work with a lot of kids that need a lot of text explained to them because they have [SIGH] learning disabilities etc., [SIGH] so ah [MN] it's interesting to me to see what certain [SIGH] books are being read in terms of the curriculum.  And I know, ah, certain things that are being read now in terms of what's going on in the world and what has gone on in the world [SIGH] -- kinda interesting that certain --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- things are being read so [SIGH] I --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [MN] agree with you that ah things shouldn't be +censor -- censored because uh [SIGH] how will [MN] children who are our future adults learn what has gone on in the world if they're not able to read everything that's out there about what has gone on in the world?  So I'm -- I'm in total agreement with you.
R:  Mhm -- mhm.
L:  [SIGH] Um, it's interesting to see because [SIGH] it's so important that [MN] children and -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- young adults are exposed to everything because that's when they have questions about it and, [SIGH] you know, when it's -- it's ah exposed to them, [SIGH] it's sort of like fresh information and, if they don't get exposed to everything, [SIGH] they develop opinions [SIGH] based on lack of knowledge.
R:  Right -- right --
L:  So um --
R:  -- they're already biased because --
L:  Howe- --
R:  -- people have already selected the things and they will read.
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause I know a lot of the kids like in --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- say fifth grade, they're learning [SIGH] a little bit about --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the Holocaust and they're reading ah -- one of the books they read is Number the Stars --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and [SIGH] a lot of the kids have a lot of questions about it and [SIGH] they're like, "Did this really happen?"
R:  Mm.
L:  And you know, it's -- it's so interesting because as adults [MN] we -- we know what has happened --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and [SIGH] you know we --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- so quickly forget that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- kids don't know that this has happened.  This wasn't in their [SIGH] -- you know realm of being exposed to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] so ah, I totally agree that things shouldn't be censored.  I mean [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- granted certain things at certain ages need a lot more explanation [SIGH] and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, who should be doing that?  Y- you know that lends itself to be a question but [SIGH] uh --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I don't think it should be censored and -- and you know people need to step up to the plate --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- in terms of [SIGH] explaining certain issues --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- to them and -- 
R:  -- [NOISE] 
L:  -- and parents need to [SIGH] be explaining --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- certain topics to kids and not leaving it all up to the schools 'cause that's when things get a little hairy and [SIGH] -s not fair to let --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- public schools or private schools become [SIGH] the parent --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and explaining touchy things that -- that you --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- know, that -- that it's blamed on the schools.  "Why are you talking about this?"  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, you know [SIGH] [MN] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- not telling them about it --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- doesn't mean they're not gonna learn about it so um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, I -- I strongly believe that -- that things shouldn't [NOISE] be censored for them.  I mean [SIGH] you have to set some sort of level of what you're telling kids at certain ages --
R:  Right.
L:  -- what they have --
R:  I agree.
L:  -- the capacity to understand --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- but uh --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know [MN] --
R:  [NOISE] There's gotta be level appropriate and age [NOISE] appropriate --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- um, y- yeah.  I agree.  Hm.
L:  So we don't have to disagree with it [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but it is [SIGH] -- 
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- it is important you know, in schools [inaudible] know, that everybody be exposed to everything you know.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] How can we expect everybody to come --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- out a- and deal with what's going on in the world if they're not being exposed to [SIGH] every side of an argument or every side of an issue?
R:  [NOISE] Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] So um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I don't see why it should be censored but, you know, some -- uh, many people feel like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] "I don't want my child to know about that" and it's that whole ignorance thing that [SIGH] ends up getting half the --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- world into the mess that it's in right now.
R:  That's right.  That's right.  It's because they haven't been exposed to things tha- that they're [NOISE] eighteen years old and for the first time they encounter a new religion or a new --
L:  Race or a --
R:  -- race yeah -- 
L:  -- new person or a new gender -- 
R:  -- an- they're -- you know and they're in shock. [LAUGH]
L:  -- or whatever it is --
R:  Right. [NOISE] 
L:  -- and it's like uh [SIGH] [MN] -- but it's -- I dunno what it'll take for the world to --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- learn this but uh --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it's -- it's -- it'll always be an issue I think.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I had an interesting situation recently actually with a -- a nephew of mine who's about -- I guess about eight years old [LIPSMACK] who's in Catholic school [LIPSMACK] and he's obviously learning about his own religion [SIGH] [NOISE] but I happen to be Jewish.  My husband's Catholic and I'm Jewish --
L:  I'm Jewish.
R:  You're Jewish too.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  And apparently they hadn't taught him [NOISE] [MN] um enough of our comparative religion --
L:  Right.
R:  Oh okay, he's eight years old.  I know he's not gonna [SIGH] understand, you know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- big, big concepts but the fundamental differences between the two of us.  Although we have many similarities, we have a few differences [SIGH] and they -- I -- I -- I don't exactly what was said but when he understo- -- came to understand that I was Jewish he said to me, "But, Aunt Shirley, you don't believe in God" --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and I said, "Well, where did you learn that?  Of course I believe in God" and then he explained to me you now, how I don't believe in Jesus and Jesus [NOISE] was God and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean he's -- he's very logical having made the connection of the whole thing but s- -- but somebody, [NOISE] obviously, you know, censored so to speak --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- what he learned about religion and he doesn't have the big picture. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And he -- and I was concerned because he was at my house on Easter weekend [NOISE] and you know I told my sister-in-law, "Please, you know, he -- if he wants to go to church take him to church.
L:  Right.
R:  I don't want him to think that, because he's at his Jewish aunt's house, he's not going to church this weekend --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [SIGH] and uh, yeah.  Just interesting 'cause he's -- he's now -- he's a smart, inquisitive kid --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- and he's got these questions and he needs this information.
L:  Right an- it -- it's -- you know do you say --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- "Do you get the information on religion --"
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  "-- at your house of worship?"  Well, obviously we're not all doing a great job because [SIGH] even within our religions we're not presenting [NOISE] everything fairly.  Do we leave this up to the schools?  Well, then it's the same issue because [SIGH] not everybody has a good knowledge of everybody else's religion so [SIGH] I -- how do we teach children about other --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- religions?  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Is -- should this be the job of a school?  Oh, I --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- mean we do take --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- courses.  Um, when I was in college we took Comparative Religion but what do we do about the formative years, [SIGH] you know before they're eighteen?
R:  Right. [COUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] [MN] You know?  An- and whose job --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- is it 'cause obviously in -- in our -- in our --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- own houses --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- of worship we're not [SIGH] giving everybody equal time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or we're not really -- we have our own prejudices within so, you know?  And this is the root of what everything that's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- going on in the world today.  The people hate other people because of their religion and [SIGH] -- and this is so ingrained.  I mean this is why what's going on in the world today is going on.
R:  Right -- right.
L:  I mean in -- in uh  so I --I -- think th- there has to be more of -- of teaching this in the school but who should do it?  How?  That's another sticky little point --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because [SIGH] you know, it ah -- [MN] being in a school system I sometimes -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] you know Christmas gets a big play --
R:  Mhm -- m.  Hm.
L:  -- and I always say you know, "I don't want to be looking at little angels in school.  I don't think it's appropriate" --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and you know everybody says, "Oh that's not it -- that's not Christmas" and I said, "You know what?  It is".
R:  Ya right.  
L:  "I mean it's a religious [inaudible] --"
R:  They don't even realize anymore. [LAUGH] [SIGH] 
L:  "And the Christmas tree, you know that's --"  "No, that's not" and I'm thinking, "You know what?  I don't have a tree --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- I never did 'cause I --"  "Oh, you don't?"  "No, I don't [SIGH] because it's a reli- -- it's -- it's --".  [LIPSMACK] Granted it's now a commercial -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- thing but it -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it means something in rel- -- in -- in Christianity --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it does not mean anything in Judaism so --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- why would I ha- -- and people still, intelligent people --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- still don't get it.  So --
R:  Intelligent adults don't even get it, you know?
L:  Right.  So -- so -- so --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- if -- if we can figure out how to give everybody equal time --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and [SIGH] even how to give people who don't believe in it equal --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- time.  You know, the --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- Christian Scientists or -- or the Seventh Day Adven- -- whatever you -- even if --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you're agnostic [SIGH] you have to get -- everybody --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- has a right to believe --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- whatever they --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- want to.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You want to pray to a garbage can?  Fine.
R:  Right -- right.
L:  I mean ah, but -- but that's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- uh you know. [SIGH] You'd -- you'd think [MN] in this day and age people would believe it but that's sort of very, "Oh no" you know?  [SIGH] So you gotta be [NOISE] careful and you certainly don't want to hurt anybody's feeling w- with any of this [SIGH] but many people take it as an affront if you're not like them.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  And ah, I dunno, maybe that's what separates us from animals is that we all --
