L:  Hi there.
R:  Hi.
L:  Did you understand what the topic was?
R:  Um, something about censor- censorship in books.  I don't know.
L:  Yeah.  I couldn't quite hear it.  Could you?
R:  Uh un.  No.
L:  [LAUGH]  Okay.  Well, I guess we'll just wing it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  This is my first call of these people, so I'm not really sure.  Have you done it before?
L:  I've done one before.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um and we just ah chatted for a while and then --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- somebody comes on and says, "Time's up" [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.  So --
R:  Well, so we should talk about censorship and something about children's books, wasn't it?
L:  Yeah, I guess -- maybe it's about um editing out things from -- from school books or something.  They mentioned public schools, I think, right?
R:  Yeah.  There's no way we can get them to repeat it?
L:  I -- I don't think so --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- but -- um, so what do you think about that?
R:  Um, I think it's a good idea for some things, if it's children's books --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- ah, for older people, no.  Ah -- I don't -- I guess I don't really go for censorship for adult materials, but yeah, in little kids' books, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I suppose I agree that um it depends kind of on the age, but not everything is appropriate for -- for children.
R:  But -- yeah, but then again I have seen some pretty crazy books um for little kids that -- to explain things like ah going to the bathroom [LAUGH] and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and crazy things that they maybe want to explain and -- and it was really blunt and I guess, you know, I guess it's up to the parents, so --
L:  Right.  Um, I think I -- I've seen ah children's book about -- about poop, basically [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  So, and I thought it was okay for -- for that particular child; he was okay with it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so he didn't, you know, laugh his head off or anything --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it just depends on the family, maybe.
L:  Right.  Right.  Do you have any children?
R:  No, I don't.  Do you?
L:  Yeah, I've got a six month old baby.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, he's -- he's not reading books yet, but --
R:  Yeah.  Well, it's still different from your perspective, then.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  I don't -- I don't really know first hand what -- what I would think.
L:  Right.  Yeah.  I think that I personally, you know, I might have a lot of ideas about how I want to raise my kid, but I've found out already that -- that I -- I don't know until things come up you know [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.
L:  -- how I'm going to feel, you know, about how protective I want to be or not, or, you know --
R:  Yeah.  I guess I think that if parents should sort of look through everything and censor it as they go themselves --
L:  Right.
R:  -- maybe it's not up to a big pu- publishing company or publisher, something like that, um, because p- the parents really should do it anyway, no matter what --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or read with the child so --
L:  Yeah.  I agree.  Um, I also think, you know, the same thing with television too that -- that -- I feel personally that um children should be allowed to be exposed to things but with ah adult guidance and adult conversation.
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.
L:  Because a lot of times people try to just um protect their child from seeing anything and then, you know, all these sort of off limits ideas become really attractive to kids, I think.  You know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- whereas if they're presented to them --
R:  [inaudible] --
L:  -- but -- but, you know, in a safe way in a -- and with -- with conversation about it --
R:  That's true.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What do you think about censorship um for kids who listen to Eminem and things like that?
L:  Um, I don't agree with that, personally.
R:  Yeah.  The censoring --
L:  Um -- 
R:  -- or the -- the music or --
L:  Censoring.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, because, I don't know, my -- for the same reasons that I said that -- because I think it just makes it more, you know, interesting --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to make things taboo --
R:  Yeah.  That --
L:  [MN]
R:  Yeah, I agree.
L:  Um, I also don't necess- you know, like with -- when -- I -- I was raised where in my family it was okay to use swear words, but we were --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- taught that it -- that we should never use them around anybody else --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- and um and I never swear, you know, it just kind of like, it made it -- like for a minute it was kind of thrilling to be able to, you know, say all those words and -- and know that other kids couldn't say them in front of their parents --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um but after testing it out, it just was kind of, you know, it's like, oh, well -- you know, those words are just kind of boring, you know.
R:  Yeah.  I think that's a good way to parent if you can get it -- I don't know how you'd really make sure that it would work that way because I have seen kids who've grown up in families like that where they swear every other word --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and it -- and my fa- I'm not really sure how -- how parents pull that off, but in my family I wasn't allowed to even say "Shut up" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I -- I guess I don't swear that often, but I -- I do, so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I don't know.
L:  Yeah, I swear sometimes, but um -- but my parents didn't swear a lot, either --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, when they -- when they -- so, it wasn't like I heard them saying, you know, like the F word every other word or something.
R:  Mhm.
L:  If I did, I think I probably would have sworn more, you know.
R:  Yeah.  Well, basically I just think that whenever -- kids are going to be exposed to everything --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I mean, they're so -- it's getting so crazy with society and things that they have on TV all the time and I -- I used to work at a daycare where there was one family and they didn't have a television in their home --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they just read books all the time and they were educational books and those kids were the naughtiest ones in the whole daycare --
L:  [LAUGH] Really?
R:  So, I don't -- I -- I don't really know what I think about that.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I think that's kind of common that kids who aren't allowed to a lot of things, then they really want to act out, you know?
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  But it's -- it's hard to say.  You know, and I -- I don't know, there are some things, like I think there are a lot of religious groups who would probably like to censor things about -- out of books like, you know, like a book like um -- what -- what's that book about a kid who has lesbian parents?  You know, things that mention homosexuality --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- their p- --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And -- and I think that that shouldn't be censored, you know.  Cer- --
R:  I think those things should be kept separate --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- just ah religious groups shouldn't be allowed to decide those things --
L:  Right.
R:  -- unless it's within their church and the families want it that way --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but um I think religion should be kept to religion and books to books and things like that, so --
L:  Right.  Well, that kind of go back -- goes back to what you were saying earlier about um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that families should be the ones who decide what their -- what their children see, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, I mean, if it's in the school, I could -- I could imagine if somebody comes from a very religious family who doesn't believe in certain lifestyles or whatever and then, you know, they might feel angry if their child goes to school and -- and reads a book about a -- a gay couple, you know --
R:  Yeah.  And I -- yeah, I agree, I would be a little bit nervous about that when I have kids entering school, but um I think that they're pretty careful about that in schools.  I hope they're careful about that, especially um in -- see I'm in the mi- I'm in the mid west and so we --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- don't have a lot of -- our schools are pretty good --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, I have --
L:  Where in the mid west are you?
R:  Iowa.
L:  Iowa.  Oh.
R:  And I -- I don't really know if in other communities in poor -- poorer towns, poorer schools, if they're that well off, but I doubt that if they had a chance to buy lots of books that they would go buying, you know, I think they would buy Harry Potter books or something --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I don't know.  I could be wrong.  I haven't been in school for a while.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  But then again, Harry Potter, there were -- there were religious groups who were opposed to -- to Harry Potter because, you know, some religious groups feel that ma- you know, books about magic --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that that's kind of the occult or something.
R:  But see, I don't think that a kid -- I don't think a child's mind would take it that way --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I mean, of course everybody wants to cause a fuss over something --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but the kids just want to have access to imagination and creativity and new ideas and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that's what they've got with that book.  I -- so I don't really agree with all -- all of that Harry Potter, the people who oppose that stuff --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I -- I -- I own one of those books and I have -- I can only say I've read a couple of chapters of it, but so far what I read, I didn't find a problem with it.
L:  Right.  Yeah.  Me either.  Yeah.  I re- I read the first one.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I think it's great that -- that those books are getting kids to -- to read more, you know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  There's a lot of --
R:  And --
L:  -- children who otherwise wouldn't read who are starting to read because they've gotten into those books.
R:  And there's so much excitement, like as soon as a new movie comes out, everybody just runs for it and they promote it so much and so at least, you know, it's finally book that's out --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or a set of books that kids are excited about just as much as Nemo or whatever movie is coming out --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so I think that's a good thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And especially since she's ah British, isn't she?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know, I feel like that's better because it's exposing like different types of writers and things like that --
L:  Yeah.  I think the -- I think British -- the British tend to use different words, you know, than we do and so, yeah, it kind of broadens children's and adults vocabulary too, I think.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cen- censorship I think is a really -- it's such a um tricky um concept though, I mean like when you talk about like things like -- like pornography for instance --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that should, you know, there's like a fine line sometimes between art and pornography --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it's just -- it's -- it's so often a judgment call, I think --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know?  I mean, some things are just obvious.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But
