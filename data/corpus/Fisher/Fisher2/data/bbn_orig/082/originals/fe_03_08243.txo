R:  [NOISE] Hi, I'm Bonnie -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- from South--
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- Carolina. [NOISE] 
L:  Hi [NOISE] I'm Cindy from Pennsylvania. 
R:  Okay.  How're you doing today?
L:  I'm [NOISE] doing pretty good.  How 'bout you? 
R:  Okay.  What's your opinion on the question [NOISE] as regards to private schools -- 
L:  Um. [NOISE] 
R:  -- [NOISE] and the books? [NOISE] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:   D- -- d- -- [NOISE] 
L:  Well, [NOISE] I'm sorry w- who's the question again?
R:  Okay. [NOISE] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's [LAUGH] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I think it dealt with private schools, um [MN] wi- -- with censorship and with reading certain books.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Do they have the right? 
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] Ah [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] yeah I think they do.
R:  [NOISE] Ok- okay, why would you say that?  [NOISE] 
L:  Uh [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know [NOISE] as long as they're appropriate --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- age appropriate --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I don- --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  -- have a --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- see that it's a problem.
R:  [NOISE] I -- I agree because um [NOISE] they had a problem in this area [NOISE] with -- w- -- w- -- with public schools --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- giving kids --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- certain books to read and [NOISE] they weren't appropriate so that I feel as long as they're appropriate [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [NOISE] and their parents [NOISE] do have the right to look at the books before they let the kids read it --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and come in review them. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah, [NOISE] yeah.  I think that's--
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- right --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- too, you know if you -- 
R:  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  -- as long as the parents are [NOISE] all right with it.
R:  Mhm,
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And um -- because when my daughter was in school, [NOISE] um, I would read one of her books and then there were certain words there --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and the teacher said, "Well" --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- "just skip over", but I feel this way.  Once this entered the mind, even you skip over you still have to see that phrase or words --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it -- and once it gets planted in the mind, it's hard to get it out. [NOISE] 
L:  Yes.
R:  [MN] So how -- so how do you feel about that?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I -- I -- I agree with you um. [NOISE] 
R:  [MN] Do they have many, um, primary schools in your area?
L:  There is some --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- good -- um my kids go -- my -- my -- only one of mine goes to school right now --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he goes to a public school.
R:  Okay.  My daughter was home schooled.  We thought about putting her in -- in -- in private school uh but it's basically the same problems as public schools so ...  This is going to be a long ten minutes. [LAUGH] 
L:  I know it is. [LAUGH]  I never did this before so [LAUGH] ...
R:  No, this is my first time.
L:  It's mine too.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]  Okay, [several inaudible words] call --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and they said we're gonna have to say something uh -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- continue on with this subject with -- with -- with censorship and all [SIGH] but um ... [LIPSMACK] Anyway, do you have -- think they have the right to uh censor books?
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Um --
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
L:  Y- -- [NOISE] you know, I guess there's some things that you know people don't believe in [NOISE] and then maybe they would have the right but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if the -- if the parents -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- okayed it --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I think they --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- have the right. [SIGH]
R:  Okay, because -- 'cause in -- in some of the things they, um -- in the books that --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they teach the kids with [NOISE] evolution, um w- -- gay rights and -- and different things, so you know, it's the -- the parents would have to decide the final --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah --
R:  -- go of it.
L:  -- and the something like that would be [NOISE] really stuff that [NOISE] you might not want your kids --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that you would want to +censor the books.
R:  B- -- because um, must have been a couple of months ago [MN] one of the books that uh was being censored in the schools here in South Carolina -- you know we kinda live near the beach [LIPSMACK] -- was about this um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- this gay kid in school and I think he was stoned --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- or something and that book was um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they wanted the kids to read it [NOISE] but a lot of parents put a stop to it. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] So, how old is your child?
L:  I have one um fourteen, four and two. [SIGH] 
R:  Oh, okay, okay. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] How old -- how old is yours?
R:  Mm a- -- actually now my daughter is twenty six. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  Oh. [LAUGH] [MN]
R:  But um [NOISE] it wa- -- it was -- it was a --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- hard struggle with her and -- and [MN] -- it's been a hard being a parent today 'cause there's so much [NOISE] out there with books and -- and different things. [LIPSMACK]  We're kinda weaving away from the [SIGH] subject but -- wi- -- with private schools --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- but um [NOISE] a lotta times with private schools um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they're not under the same jurisdictions as public schools.
L:  Oh [NOISE] I didn't realize that.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm. [NOISE] [MN] 
L:  Because I really haven't [NOISE] um [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- checked into private [NOISE] schools so I'd -- don't really know what all they do [NOISE] differently. [NOISE] 
R:  The- -- they -- they're funded differently too. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  [MN] [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh my.  [LAUGH] I [NOISE] never realized ten minutes was so long.
R:  Mhm. [LAUGH] [NOISE] and you know, I just did this on the internet today.
L:  So did I.
R:  [LAUGH] Okay. [MN] 
L:  And I -- that's why I wasn't expecting a call already.
R:  No.  I thought, you know -- I -- I --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I thought it would just ... [NOISE] I -- I do uh mystery shopping stuff [NOISE] and so I saw where someone had posted it and I said, "Let [MN] well --"
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  "-- let me try it". 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] But anyway we can -- must have -- continue to talk on this subject. [NOISE] Um, [NOISE] [PAUSE] --
L:  Um.
R:  -- you got to say something. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH]
R:  I should have listened to the question more carefully because I was in the midst [NOISE] of cooking.
L:  Yeah [NOISE] I didn't list- to it so well either. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  I just um ...
R:  [NOISE] But it just basic- said something about --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- private schools having the right to censor [NOISE] the books or something to that nature. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] And I'm just a sweating here because [LAUGH] I don't know what else to say. [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH] Well.
R:  [NOISE] But anyway you -- your -- your kids are the nice spaced out, aren't they?
L:  Oh [LAUGH] yeah.  They -- they definitely are.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Keep me busy.
R:  [NOISE] They do.  I know when my daughter was going it was -- it was -- it was hard.  She kept me pretty busy too with just one.  Only wanted one. [NOISE] 
L:  Uh-huh. [NOISE] 
R:  Actually I didn't want that one.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Ah, I shouldn't say that -- it was a surprise because [SIGH] this world is so filled with problems and different --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- things and -- and this like w- -- [MN] with certain books and stuff [SIGH] I did -- I didn't want my -- wanted 'em to -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- become too involved with that.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  It -- it's --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- really hard.
L:  Is [NOISE] that why you home schooled? [NOISE] 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  But you know um, like with home school either um -- I'd a -- had decided --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- one time, like a private school --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and a lot of people say that she -- she could inter- react --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- with other people.  So I'm going to let her --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [MN] uh, go to um like functions -- like take dance --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- classes and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- different things, and she would have to be tested each year to see if she was --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- being kept up um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- with the regular kids in regular public school.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  [LIPSMACK] So um [NOISE] I didn't try to shelter --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- her like some people say that I was trying to do.
L:  Right.
R:  But I wanted you know [NOISE] just to give her a good --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- start.
L:  Yeah.  That's -- that's great that you could do that.  [NOISE] 
R:  Well, but it's hard [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- 'cau- -- yeah, you really get to know your child.  You have to -- [NOISE] er some things you have to be really committed to --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- but um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] I commend it to anybody. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  So many people -- parents are doing that [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- in the schools.  They're not sending their kids to private school.  They're home schooling them because the sch- [NOISE] schools are real bad here.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] And you w- --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you wouldn't think so but [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] it's just part of the times that we're living in. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH] Around [NOISE] here I found --
R:  -n 
L:  -- the schools to be -- to be fine.  You know, my son has always gone to the same school --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I never really considered, uh [PAUSE] [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- never really considered a [NOISE] private school or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know the -- [NOISE] and now that they've, you know, the censoring [NOISE] and stuff --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Well w- --
L:  -- because uh I've always been okay with the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with the public schools.
R:  Well, you know one year at -- at the school, when um m- -- actually, my daughter wanted to try public school until her dad says, "If you do it you're gonna have to stay the whole year.  It's your decision".  And so, um, three months later she tells me, "I want to come out" and her father said, "No, you made this decision.  You have to stick to it".
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And so she opt- -- the rest of the year um after that to be -- finish being taught at home.
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  [LIPSMACK] But um.  I don't know.  [LAUGH] I didn't even time this.
L:  No I didn't either. [NOISE] 
R:  Mm.
L:  Do we have to just [MN]?
R:  [MN] No, they will tell us when the ten minutes -- ten minutes is up.
L:  Oh okay.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  But um.  Anyways still you have to monitor what you kids read.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay. [LAUGH] 
L:  And it [SIGH] [LAUGH] ... I'm sorry I'm bad at this.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mm no, that's okay.  I mean [SIGH] well they's um -- I hate to talk.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I hope the -- the next subject'll be a little easier.  I hope they still use us.
L:  I know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You'd think if they have different things they would try --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- try again -- 
R:  And you know I will listen more carefully 'cause I had just put -- just taken out um something out of the oven and she said this is such and such a person.  And I was so -- because I had -- as I said I had just put this in [NOISE] um in the computer today and they call. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I was playing with my little girl and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and I really wasn't paying attention when --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I answered the phone either.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] Okay.  [LAUGH] It should be close to ten minutes --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and even though I'm enjoying talking to you [LAUGH] ... 
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  What part of Pennsylvania do you live in?
L:  Um, near Lancaster. [NOISE] 
R:  Okay. [NOISE]  Do you know where Myrtle [NOISE] Beach is?
L:  Oh my, yeah.
R:  I live right outside of Myrtle Beach. [NOISE] 
L:  I've heard it's so beautiful there.
R:  Yes it -- it is beautiful.
