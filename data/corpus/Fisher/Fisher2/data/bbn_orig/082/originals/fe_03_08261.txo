R:  [MN] Hello.
L:  [NOISE] Hello.
R:  Hello.  This is Bob.
L:  Hi, Bob.  This is Melanie.
R:  Uh, Melanie?
L:  Yes.
R:  How are you Melanie?
L:  Good, how are you?
R:  Good.
L:  [SIGH] [MN] [NOISE] 
R:  What do you think about schools choosing the [MN] subject matter for students?
L:  Um, well, as far as the -- the way it -- it's -- if the schools are doing it, I think a lot of times any more -- I know it's -- in our school systems, what they re doing right now is in order to get more monies or funds --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they are, um, [LIPSMACK] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- taking places like Visa and Visa pays 'em a certain amount or the kids a certain amount.  And basically they're, like, choosing the curriculum, you know, in the school, in the c- --
R:  Visa's choosing the curriculum?
L:  Basically they have, like, these -- these classes that are sponsored by Visa.  It -- it might be something like, um, [COUGH] how to use credit wisely.  [LIPSMACK] Or --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- how to use a credit card or, you know, that type of thing.
R:  Oh.
L:  Which is kind of a new deal.  Our kid just went to summer school this summer --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and that was sponsored by Visa as well.  And, um, it, w- -- you know, it was an optional summer school thing.  He was allowed if he wanted to go, you know, to go.  So, it's, like, a fun curriculum.  And at the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- end if they went every day, they got a hundred dollar visa card.  So ...
R:  Is that right?
L:  Yeah.  He thought that was pretty cool but I don't know, I -- I [several inaudible words] ha- -- you know, keen on the idea of them getting credit cards that early and, you know, [LAUGH] starting to get in the whole credit, you know, the whole credit game.  So what --
R:  Right.
L:  -- what do you think about it?
R:  [NOISE] [inaudible] --
L:  Are you there?  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Are -- are you still there?
R:  I'm still here.
L:  Okay.  So, what do you think about the topic?  [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] Well, [PAUSE] the, um, [PAUSE] I guess you have to pick your schools carefully if you're going to go to a private school or a public school.
L:  Yeah.  Hm.
R:  And where you live.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] If you had a religious school, they would pick books for you because a, uh, a private sectarian school, they would [PAUSE] they would, uh, pick the, um, [PAUSE] subject matter for you.  And if you go to college, I guess colleges pick subject matter too.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  [NOISE] Yeah.  I recently heard a pretty interesting little discussion on the radio about that college curriculum.  Uh, we -- we -- we live in a -- a town that has a large university in it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, they were talking on the radio about how it seems to be that any more colleges are -- have a very liberal -- I guess it was more toward the -- the political slant but it was a more liberal slant to, you know, college and college classes.  And then -- and then if you're conservative, you have a harder time in college.  So, I -- I don't know.  I know our --
R:  Most colleges are liberal.
L:  Yeah.  Well, that --
R:  Most education is liberal education.
L:  Well, that was a big, you know, a big --
R:  Unless you go to a --  
L:  -- discussion.
R:  -- unless you go to a -- a conservative, religious school.
L:  Like, and this is a large university that's not, you know -- but it --
R:  Well, [inaudible] there's religious [inaudible] like, [several inaudible words].
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's a religious college.  And there is parochial schools that are catholic --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they're religious.  And they re liberal.
L:  Boy, they really were having a fight on the radio about that though.  You know the peop- --
R:  Maybe not.
L:  I don't know.  I mean, I -- I know when I went to college, we went to a smaller, private college and they were, you know, they were really liberal.  It used to be a private, you know, like, a religious women's college, and now it's an open to the -- both males and females, and it's not religious any more.  But they are -- they were very liberal.  But I didn't mind that.  I mean, I guess I'm k- kinda liberal anyway, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  I wouldn't -- when I went up -- I majored in [inaudible] when I was at -- in school.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And, um, [several inaudible words] and, um, [inaudible] times and they were all liberal but I was conservative.
L:  Yeah.  And that's what --
R:  Because my -- because my father was a republican, I took his views.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [MN] But I, uh -- 
L:  Well, that's what the majority of folks --
R:  -- was brought up a republican.
L:  -- well the majority of --
R:  But I've been -- I was taught 
L:  -- folks that were calling in --
R:  -- democrat. 
L:  Yeah.  I don't know that I was -- I was any particular party I guess.  But I don't know, it seems like the most of the folks that were calling on that radio show were upset because they were conservative, you know, or conservative viewpoint --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but the schools they were going to were very liberal.  And that they were actually, you know, discriminated against because they were conservative in a liberal soci- -- you know area.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I never thought about that before.  I mean, I -- I guess it never did bother me.  I just never --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- thought about that as being an issue.  You know, I -- we didn't have --
R:  Well -- 
L:  -- any problems in school that way, you know.
R:  Most, um, the difference between conservative and liberal is how much control the government has though.  [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And [PAUSE] that's become fuzzy between parties now because, um, while the democrats traditionally are for government control, over education and everything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Welfare and everything.
L:  Well --
R:  Republicans on the other hand are against control.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're a strictly capitalist democratic government.  Some competition will -- 
L:  Well --
R:  -- and that's good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And tells you that a sort of a mix up both but we're getting the -- a blend of the parties now that the republicans are in power and they see the necessity of controlling things a little bit more.
L:  Huh.
R:  Because they are in power.  And they haven't been in power for what, seventy years, sixty seven years.
L:  Yeah.
R:  As a turn power they want to start controlling things a little bit.  So, it's a -- it -- no matter where you go to school, you're going to get the consensus of opinion with the government.
L:  Yeah.
R:  If you go- -- unless you belong -- go to a private school.  
L:  Yeah.  And who can afford private schools any more.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I know we can't.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Not with the way things are going right now in the economy.  They just -- at our s- -- at our university where -- where I work at, they just made a new thing, we were the last one of the big twelve.  Most of this -- big twelve schools, they do this deal where if you work there, your kids get at least a -- you -- discount on education.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ours was the very last one holding out.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  And it's finally --
R:  What school was that?
L:  University of Missouri, Columbia.  Our --
R:  Hm. 
L:  -- we have a new president and he finally came in and just said, "Look, all the rest of the big twelve are doing it, you all should have been doing it years ago".  So, he changed it.
R:  I'll be darned. 
L:  So, now we -- we might actually be able to afford to send our kid to college.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I was pretty excited about that.  I could have just emailed that guy and walked over to his office and kissed him.  I mean, we've been waiting for that for a long time.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's gonna be a good, you know, really good benefit for a lot of us.
R:  Yes.
L:  But I about died when I saw how much tuition was for, you know, a year.
R:  It's expensive.
L:  Yeah, it is.  So --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I don't know.  [COUGH] I don't know, m- my son is in public school right now though, and, you know, we live one -- we're on the outskirts of a -- that large town in -- where University of Missouri is and, you know, it -- our school doesn't have much funding so they're trying to pull in whatever they possibly can, which is why I think they went with this whole Visa program.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  But, I mean, we -- we've tried very, very hard --
R:  Money that speak -- the money does speak in schools.
L:  Yeah.  Well, especially in small town schools, like, ours.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, it's a very tiny school.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  And they just don't --
R:  How many students are there?
L:  H- -- uh, well, in my son's class there are [LIPSMACK] I wanna say twenty three, twenty four.  Twe- --
R:  Oh, twenty three students in the whole school?
L:  Twenty -- well, no.  In -- in the -- his class.  I wanna --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- say in the whole school, we probably have --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- five hundred, six hundred.
R:  Oh, right.  That -- that's a school.
L:  Yeah.  That's a pretty small school, you know.
R:  That's a small school, but it -- it's a school.
L:  Yeah.  Well, yeah.
R:  It's not like a one roomed building or anything.
L:  Oh, no.  [LAUGH] No.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But they don't have --
R:  I thought you said [inaudible] I thought you were saying there was twenty three students in the whole school [several inaudible words] 
L:  Oh, no.  This is K two, twelve but that -- we just don't have --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- we don't have any kind of accreditation programs to make it to where we can get extra funding, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's -- the- -- it's very, very hard for them to get funding.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  So, and it's a -- and it's very hard for our kids to compete when it comes time to go to college.  You know, they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they don't have the same skills what a kid from a bigger school has.  So --
R: Right. 
L:  -- I don't know, it's --
R:  I don't imagine they pay the teachers much either.
L:  No.  And we can't keep teachers.  And we can't even oh -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I -- I, um -- [LIPSMACK] I feel like -- this sounds bad but they -- they kind of --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- scrape the barrel on the, you know, on the bottom of the barrel on who do they get that they can get.  
R:  Yeah. 
L:  It's a last ditch effort --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if a teacher can't find any better place to go with better +pay, they end up in our town.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I imagine the students are well behaved though?
L:  Well, not really any more.
R:  Yeah, I taught school for a while, but as a substitute teacher when I was going to graduate school --
L:  Oh, really?
R: -- in the public schools here.  And it was a inner city type thing and the students were -- it was just terrible.
L:  Oh, I can imagine.  I would -- I wouldn't want to teach school.  [LAUGH] Especially as a substitute.  Substitutes are the most abused people in a school system I think.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I can't imagine the pay for that's very good --
