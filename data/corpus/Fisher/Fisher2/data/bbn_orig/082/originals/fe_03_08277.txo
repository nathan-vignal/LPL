L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, my name's Heather, from New --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- York.
R:  Hi, Heather.  I'm actually Nancy, from New York City.
L:  Oh, okay.  Um. [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  So, what do you feel about censorship?
R:  [SIGH] Well, I am really [NOISE] against censorship --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- especially in the schools.  I think that students should be allowed to read or, um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- watch or comment on any topic that [NOISE] they feel that they want to.  I feel that's really part of, um, education.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, how do you feel about it?
L:  Yeah.  I -- I mean I don't think they should prohibit anyone from reading any kind of book.  I mean, like, what is it going to give them ideas?  It -- it's not gonna really give 'em any ideas to do something, you know?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Right.
L:  Like it's not g- -- I don't mean -- I can't see any, like, books hurting someone --
R:  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  -- just by reading some things.
R:  Right, did -- when you were in school did you ever feel censored?
L:  Um, no.  I don't think so.
R:  N- -- yeah.  I don't think I did either.  I'm trying to remember back -- especially in college I certainly was never censored.  [SIGH] 
L:  Yes.
R:  [MN] I think probably, maybe in high school, things were probably controlled and maybe --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I didn't realize it, um, but I never felt like, um, I couldn't really talk about something.
L:  Yeah.  Right.  Me either.
R:  You know, that I -- that was in my mind.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Me too.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah, I didn't feel, like -- like, I mean, they didn't prohibit us from reading any kinds of books or anything, like -- I don't remember anything like that.
R:  Right and a- actually today I guess everybody is sort of exposed to so much more [SIGH] than they were even five or six years ago.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, because [MN] everything is just so much more global.
L:  Yeah.  I mean if someone wants to do something or, like, oh, kids can become, like, a terrorist or something, or anything like that, they're gonna do it either way [inaudible] still allowed to read something or not.
R:  [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] Yep.  I believe in that too --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- I think they're personally driven. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.  I don't think they're gonna, like, develop any ideas from certain books.
R:  N- -- yeah.  [SIGH] Although people do say when they show -- you know, people view certain movies --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or they --
L:  They become violent.
R:  -- they watch something on television, [SIGH] that it gives them ideas --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  -- but I think the people [SIGH] that sort of do that are unstable to begin with [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah [LAUGH] seriously.
R:  -- [SIGH] and there's not much you can do for them. [LAUGH]
L:  That's true.  I mean, they say that, like if kids watch violent TV they become v- -- more violent --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but they've got to become -- they ha- -- already have to be a [NOISE] little bit violent to start, like, killing people, so --
R:  Right -- right --
L:  -- I don't --
R:  -- right.
L:  -- think they're just gonna copy whatever someone does on TV. [NOISE] 
R:  That's exactly -- yeah.  That's exactly the way I feel.  It's true.
L:  Yes.  Uh well. [LAUGH] So, yeah, I don't think they should censor anything.  I mean, I don't think they should be reading, like uh -- like, Ku Klux Klan -- like, I dunno.  They can read about it.  They shouldn't, like -- I dunno.  I mean, um, like, I don't think they should read a book by someone who's in the Ku Klux Klan --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- like, that kind of thing, but --
R:  Huh, I think it should be available to be read.  How- -- you know the teachers don't have to support it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh --
L:  I don't think they should be able to assign somebody to read something like that.
R:  -- but, um, it should be available for people that, you know, [NOISE] are interested in reading it.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] That's true.  Um, yeah, I dunno. [SIGH] 
R:  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  That's about it. [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah.  This -- it's censorship.  I guess we've been lucky.  I don't know if you grew up -- did you [NOISE] grow up in New York?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Were you schooled in New York?
L:  No.  Long Island.
R:  In Long Island.  But +no, it's very close.  Well, in Long Island they've had some censorship issues I think over the years.  [SIGH] But I think, uh, y- know, in the area that we grew up in [LIPSMACK] we were lucky.  We really didn't have to [NOISE] ah [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] I dunno, be subjected to that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, whereas other cities or other communities across the country I think were a little [LIPSMACK] more less liberal shall we say? [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  [SIGH] -- than the New York metropolitan area.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I'm in college now so, like --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- we -- w- we read, like, everything.  Like, it's not, like, anything's, like, censored, like.  Like -- like, you could talk about everything, like.  No one's gonna take offence or go, like -- like I never had anyone go crazy over our reading something.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, in college or anything like that.
R:  Mhm.  [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] Well, do you feel that any of your professors really sorta take a strong point --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- of view on something?
L:  Um.  Y- -- if they do -- like, if they have a point of view, they -- they do try to, like -- kinda, like, convince us that it's true --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- something -- sometimes I see that.
R:  Yeah -- yeah.
L:  But I mean, not, like, all the time.  Just, like, if they feel a certain way.
R:  Right.  [SIGH] Which -- I think the students are really more affected almost by their teachers than they are by what they're taught or what they've read.
L:  Yeah.  That's true.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Because you do, um --
L:  'Cause I mean, the teacher's been around so I guess you kinda believe what they say.
R:  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK] Exactly.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  And you think they -- they're an authority figure --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] and uh you look up to them and uh [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] and also too, I guess, you're at their mercy [LAUGH] for your grades --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- so you try to [LAUGH] [SIGH] --
L:  So you don't want to really disagree with them.
R:  -- right -- understand their point of view.
L:  No, but I mean kids do -- like, they do disagree with them, like, give their point of view.
R:  They -- they [NOISE] do?  Yeah?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hm.
L:  And, like, I -- teachers sometimes like that actually.  They like to, like, debate with the kids.
R:  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK] And sometimes they may be setting you up too.
L:  Yeah. [MN] [NOISE] 
R:  But that's healthy because there's always two sides to every --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- issue.
L:  Of course, I think college is more, like, fr- -- you're free to do more things than, like, high school I guess.
R:  [NOISE] Right.  Now --
L:  Teachers talk about most things.
R:  Mhm.  Definitely.  And you're also older so you're not afraid to argue --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, as much.
L:  That's true.  [SIGH] Um.  Trying to think what else.  Ah [SIGH] --
R:  On censorship --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- oh [SIGH] --
L:  You grew up in Manhattan?
R:  I -- well, I grew up in New Jersey --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but actually I went to -- well, I went to school through high school in, ah -- in New Jersey --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then actually I went to college on Long Island --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- undergraduate school.
L:  You went to graduate school on Long Island?
R:  Uh-huh?
L:  You said you went to graduate school on Long Island?
R:  No.  Undergraduate school.
L:  Oh.
R:  I went to C.W. Post --
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  -- as an undergraduate.
L:  Yeah -- yeah.
R:  And then I went to graduate school actually in Pittsburgh -- University of Pittsburgh.
L:  Oh.  Okay.
R:  Yeah, and I never, as a student, never really felt censored.
L:  Yeah.  Me either.
R:  But, um -- but I've heard a lot and read a lot --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, about people that live in other areas of the country --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that certainly are censored.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I really thought -- Long Island too -- I heard some things were -- books were taken off of reading lists and things like that, you know, over the years --
L:  They might.  I don't know.  I never heard that but --
R:  -- but --
L:  -- they might have been.
R:  N- yeah. [LIPSMACK]
L:  I'm not sure.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Really depends on the individual community --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um.  Which, sort of, in that way is not fair.
L: Yeah.
R:  You know, um, [LIPSMACK] that this -- the community right next door to you [MN] can have a, you know, edited [NOISE] book list --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and you're just unfortunate with -- to live in that community.  You could live in two miles away and you don't have those restrictions.
L:  Yeah, that's not fair.
R:  [LIPSMACK] So I really think that censorship should, sort of [SIGH] at least cover, you know -- e- everybody should be equal for +everything in the United States.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  I mean, 'cause I live -- like, I grew up in, like, an all white community.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- I -- like, we really learned not much about black -- who they really -- I -- I can remember --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that.  Like, we really didn't [NOISE] really learn about black history as much.
R:  [LIPSMACK] So that's a censorship I guess --
L:  Maybe.
R:  -- in a form.  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I think if there'd been any black kids in our high school then maybe we would've --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- 'cause they probably would've said something.
R:  Right.
L:  But since there wasn't maybe that's why -- that could be the reason.
R:  Yup.  True.
L:  'Cause, like, if, like, I -- it's like -- like my town's not racist but if we even, like, saw a black we're, like, "Oh, who's he?  What's he doing here?" like, you know?
R:  Right.  'Cause it was strange.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  'Cause, like, oh, my town is small.
R:  Yeah -- yeah.  [SIGH] Well, actually, I think when I went back to high school, I think there were two black kids in my high school class.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um -- and we never did, it's true, learn about black history or anything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  In [SIGH] college you -- you can sort of opt into it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, in public school -- ooh --
L:  That's right --
R:  -- you wouldn't.
L:  Like, [NOISE] I went to private school for one year and there was actually black kids in there and they wanted to learn about it so then it was, like, different -- I dunno -- -s like, because I guess it different.  And then the other white kids would be, like, "Why do they care?" like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um.  [SIGH] That's the only thing I remember --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- happening. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  But I think, yeah, it's -- it's [MN] -- everything should be available because it just opens up people's minds.
L:  Yeah.  Definitely.
R:  And ah, the more you know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- yeah, the more you [LAUGH] think about it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it really helps you.  Especially today because [MN] the whole world is so global --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and of course, here in New York [NOISE] now, you know, there -- there are so many people from different countries --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and different ethnic backgrounds [SIGH] that um, if you have any kind of understanding I think that sorta helps you to deal with your everyday frustrations.
L:  Yeah.  Like, you have to, like, now know how to, like -- like, know other cultures and stuff --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to be able to, like, deal in the business world.
R:  Exactly.  And to deal 'most every day.  I mean, you walk into a store, you get into a cab [SIGH] you know, whatever.  It most likely is going to be somebody there from a different culture, a different country.
L:  Yeah.  That's true.
R:  And, um, to a really closed mind you have a real -- [SIGH] more difficult time I think than if you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- have someone --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- just staying there.
L:  We learned school that, like, you have to, like, know other cultures 'cause, like, say -s do business with, like -- go over to, like, Japan or something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like, their ways of, like, saying "Hi" and, like, every -- like how they greet people and so if -- it's so different than what we do.
R:  Right.
L:  So, like, you kinda have to know. 
R:  Yup.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, we learn that.
R:  Yeah, that's actually --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- a great experience. [MN]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I always think if you're fortunate enough to [MN] to experience living in another country --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for just even a short --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- period of time it just makes such a big difference in your life.
L:  That's true.  What do you do for, like, a living?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, I'm an interior designer now --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but I spent, uh, quite a few years in the corporate world and the fashion business.
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And so I had a lot of opportunity to, ah, meet people from different countries --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then I also lived in Puerto Rico for a year and a half as a consultant --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- which really opened up my mind --
L:  Yeah.  It's like -- 
R:  -- to Latin country --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] and of course here in --
