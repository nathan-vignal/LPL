R:  Hi, I'm Dave.
L:  I'm Shannon.
R:  What was your name?
L:  Shannon.
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  I'm good.  How are you?
R:  Good thanks.
L:  You said your name was Dave?
R:  Dave, yes.
L:  Okay.  Well this is my first call so I'm not real sure on what I do.  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, it's mine too so I'm not sure.  I guess we're just supposed to discuss, uh, censorship in schools and stuff.
L:  He was -- [MN] they mentioned something about a -- should they be able to make children read certain books.
R:  Or not -- or allow them not to read certain books --
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  -- I guess.  Yeah.  Um, I don't know, I guess we just start, uh, I know one of the things that, uh, that's going on where I live is, um, with the Harry Potter books.
L:  Yes.  The same thing as here.
R:  Yeah.  And, um, one thing I found that I was -- I was just talking to someone at work about it and, um, her daughter wanted to do, uh, well has read all -- is reading now the fifth -- fifth or sixth book.  I don't read -- I haven't read Harry Potter --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, um, she's reading the fifth or sixth book and she wanted to do a report on them and she's in seventh grade.  She did a report on one of them and then after that the teacher said that she wasn't allowed to do it anymore.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  They didn't want her using those books.
L:  Hm.
R:  And they had a book and it was, um, that they said that they said that she should read, and this was last year, and I guess it was a book called A Boy Named It.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, her mom, read through the book and just didn't feel it was appropriate for her to read that.  It was about a child who was severely abused.
L:  Oh, really.
R:  And, um, she felt that Harry Potter was a -- a more appropriate book for someone in seventh grade than reading about real physical abuse and things like that.
L:  Yeah.  I would agree.
R:  Yeah.  But, um, there -- are they allowing the books where you are in the schools?  Or ...
L:  Actually, no.  Um, they actually have, uh, most of the school libraries here pull it from their shelves.  They, you know, had if for just a short amount of time and they had so many parents that actually called to the school complaining that their children were bringing home these books and that they promoted witchcraft and, you know, things of that nature and that they didn't want their children to have access to books like that.  So, they actually pulled all of it from the shelf.
R:  Mhm,
L:  Which of course most of the y- -- people, you know, like the librarians and such, they feel that it should be a ri- -- your right to be able to check out whichever book you like.  And, uh --
R:  Right.
L:  --  so it's been on the news quite a bit  here lately.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, [PAUSE] I mean, I -- 
R:  Wa- --
L:  -- I agree with you on the -- the books, 'cause, uh, I -- I have a sister who was -- she is fifteen now and they actually give out books, you know, to read materials on, like, sex education that I feel a re a lot more inappropriate for a child that age than say a book, you know, about a -- a wizard.  I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I -- that's just my personal opinion.  I feel like, you know, that's more fiction and, you know, it's just a story and I think people really get [LAUGH] worked up over small things like that.
R:  Well, you know, even then the kids know, you know, I feel that they -- the kid is --  is going to be reading a book of that size, from what I've seen +of them, they're rather large books.  And it takes --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a long time for them to read 'em.  If a kid's gonna read that book and actually sit down and get involved in it, they're going to understand that if it's -- it's fiction like you said and that it -- it isn't that -- it's not real.
L:  Right.
R:  And, you know, they -- they're -- they're -- if they're reading, they've got a good enough head on their shoulders as that -- they understand that that -- it's just a story.
L:  Right.
R:  And it's not going to really happen.  
L:  And al- --
R:  But like you said, some of the other books and that that are out there that ju- -- they're just inappropriate and the schools just allow them.
L:  Yeah.  I agree.
R:  You know --
L:  I mean, I think it's also a parent's responsibility of, you know, if your child's going to read something like that, that you should, you know discuss with them that this isn't real and, you know, be aware of what your child is reading.  And --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- uh --
R:  Yeah.  And -- and I don't think that, um, the schools should limit what the, you know, what the kids are allowed to read.  I mean, if the -- if the parents feel that it's appropriate, then let the parent -- let the parents be the ones in charge.
L:  Exactly.
R:  I mean, 'cause if -- if the parents are -- are decent parents  then they're going to know what their kids are doing and what they're reading and -- 'cause I know when I was -- when I was in school, um, oh, gosh, what the heck book was it?  Oh, Lord of the Flies --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that was taken out of our school system
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  And, uh, there were a number of books that -- that just dealt with social issues that they wouldn't allow in.
L:  Right.
R:  So -- but ...
L:  Yeah.  I d- -- I -- just -- I don't agree with the fact that they sh- should, uh, keep books from children like you were saying if, you know, your child brings it home and you -- it's something that you don't want them to have, then you should discuss that with then.  And maybe other parents want their children to, you know, have access to that kind of thing.  I -- I don't think they should just limit a book just because some people don't like it.
R:  Yeah.  It -- 
L:  I think it should be available and you should talk with your own child about it.  Not just what --
R:  Mhm.
L:  --two or three people say, and say well, we just won't have it for anyone.  'Cause I don't -- I think that's unfair.
R:  Yeah.  You could have one -- one administrator in there who doesn't like the author, or doesn't particularly --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like the book.  And then they're limiting that and they're taking away the -- the reading from others.  Whereas --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- kids, you know, kids need to read.  I mean, they spend too much time -- I think some of 'em spend too much time on TV and video games and that, where reading is -- is a lot of -- does them a lot of good.
L:  Yes.  I agree
R:  Yeah.  So ...
L:  It seems a shame that they work so hard to keep books away from children, but, you know, they should  be working [LAUGH] like you say, and harder to give them more activities that use their brain instead of video games and TV.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  Because I mean, the -- if a kid's gonna read, you know, there -- it's going to take 'em to all sorts of different, you know, different levels and different worlds and that.  And they can -- they can almost like travel just by reading.  They can learn a lot of things about different cultures and people and all sorts of stuff.  Whereas if they --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- they limit the books, okay, they'll be very narrow minded.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  So, well, let's see; what else -- what else are we supposed -- 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- to talk about?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I guess that's just, you know, cover the books and I guess we both agree that, uh, censorship in the schools is -- isn't something -- it should be more on the parents. 
L:  Well, I think so.  I mean, that's -- you -- I -- I just feel like you should know what your children are involved in and, you know, you have to talk with them about it and you should have the ability to choose.  I don't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- think that should be held back from anyone.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  Because it's just -- you get -- you could, you know, some of the books -- if they -- that [inaudible] [PAUSE] you know, you could almost, um, brainwash almost.  I mean, if you're -- you're really limiting and you've got an administrator or -- or librarian or somebody who has some pretty strange views of things, I mean, then that's going to affect the children as well.
L:  Right. 
R:  If they're limiting and they're -- they're just putting in what they want, that's not fair --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- to anybody.   [PAUSE] So, [PAUSE] well, that's [PAUSE] guess we --
L:  [inaudible] -- 
R:  -- kinda -- 
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  -- ended that subject.  [LAUGH] But ...
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] w- -- I was just thinking back to when I was in school, there was actually, uh, a librarian -- i- I was probably in the second or third grade -- who -- it was just kind of through the +grapevine -- grapevine, that she did not believe in, uh, pre marital sex and things such as that, and so any books that even had a slight reference to that, she would pull from the shelf personally.
R:  Hm.
L:  And she had, you know, taken this large box of books home with her and it was just -- it's thing like that like what you were saying that, you know, just because she doesn't believe in that or, you know, doesn't want any children reading about it, doesn't mean that other parents might not and -- and, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think that's really wrong.
R:  Yeah.  'Cause I mean if -- if you're looking at that and then it could end up where a book might have a bit of pre marital sex in it and say a young girl gets pregnant.  And then they have all the options that the girl has to go through --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and what to do with the child, and how to take care of it, and what the responsibility of the -- of the boy is in that situation.  Well, the kids aren't going to understand that if they don't -- they're not exposed to it.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And then they may end up having pre marital sex themselves and may end up pregnant, and not even know their options, not know their options for birth control or anything.
L:  That's right.
R:  You know, we're just -- it -- it's very l- limiting.  I mean, exactly what it is, it's limiting --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and it takes away a lot of things.
L:  Right.
R:  You know.  So, [PAUSE] yeah, there's a -- it -- it's different.  I mean, you get -- you sound like you're from the south and, I mean, you've got different attitudes there than, you know, than what you have -- I know I lived in Florida for a while -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and one of the things that happened down there; I was living in Jacksonville and, um, you were saying about, um, pre marital sex and that; I know that the, um, it was part of the Bible belt and the schools were pulling a lot of the books and doing a lot of things --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then the city council decided that they were going to take away the liquor licenses at the topless bars.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  And so when they took away the liquor licenses, the places they figured would close; instead they went totally nude.
L:  Mm.
R:  Because that was the -- the law that allowed them to do that.  And they opened up nude car washes and the -- and it started an explosion of -- of a number of more, um, nude bars instead of, uh, just topless bars --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and no liquor and, I mean, they just ended up with more and more problems.
L:  That's right.
R:  And that's, uh, you know, that's a form of --
