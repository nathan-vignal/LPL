L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  I'm Joyce Payne --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and this is the first one of these surveys I've participated in.
R:  I'm Rachel and this is the first survey that I've participated in.
L:  Uh-huh.  So, neither --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- of us know what we're doing.
R:  No, not a clue.  Um, censorship.  Um, I guess we're supposed to talk about if -- if -- did it say school?
L:  Right.
R:  If they have the right to censor --
L:  Right.
R:  -- books and things like that.  I believe that public and private schools should have the opportunity to censor --
L:  I do too.
R:  -- certain books if, you know --
L:  A- absolutely.  And of course I'm from an older generation, when it was not a question, it was done.  Ah, I think that they've, you know-- 
R:  Ah --
L:  -- they've taken so much away that doesn't help the children, it makes it worse.
R:  Exactly.  And I believe that there wouldn't be such a need for private school education if there were more censorship in the public school system.
L:  Correct.  I agree.  And I think that the teachers' and the principals' and the administrators' hands are tied because of what the laws are now telling 'em they cannot do.
R:  Exactly.  Everyone is so lawsuit happy they want to sue because they feel like their child was discriminated against by the censorship or, you know, --
L:  Well, and --
R:  -- so on and so forth like that --
L:  Yeah.  When my children were in school, I knew that anything they brought home from the school, I didn't have to censor it.
R:  Right.
L:  I knew that it was okay for them to read, they didn't have anything in the school library they should not be reading, um, and back in those days, I mean even the libraries, the public libraries you didn't have to worry about it.
R:  Right.
L:  Now, I did make sure what they were reading from the library, but there were sections that you knew for that age were okay.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And the schools were the same way.  I think that -- I think that high school students can read things that I would not okay for grade school students.
R:  Exactly.  Sure.  And I just feel like it should be more, you know, the schools should monitor it and then it should be up to the parents, you know, after that, to decide, hey, you know, if they -- if -- if the schools decide that censor- they want to censor out certain things and leave certain things, I think the parents should have the opportunity to say, "Hey, I don't want my child reading about this" --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or, "I don't want my child being exposed to this, we don't participate in this sort of lifestyle", you know, whatever like that.
L:  Well, and, you know, I know that ah the curriculum and the -- and that was used and the books that were used when -- when my daughters were in high school, they had a sex education class and a note came home whether we would allow it and I went to the teacher and I said, "I want to see the curriculum that you're using" and the teacher told me I was the only parent who even went to check out what the curriculum was.
R:  Hm.
L:  So, you know, I think if there's anything that might be a question, I think the bottom line should be what the parent wants.
R:  Exactly.  That's -- that's certainly how I feel as well, I've got a four year old son and so that's all kind of scary to me know [LAUGH] --
L:  Well, yeah, b- --
R:  -- because when I was in school it was just like you said, we had a note sent home that said, "This is what we're going to be discussing today" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- your parent had to sign it and send it in, or -- or you couldn't go to that particular class.
L:  Right.  And I don't -- I think it's too bad when parents are forced into choosing a private school because they can't trust what may be taught in a public school.
R:  Right.  Right.  And because so many things have been taken out of the public school, you know, curriculum, you know, I -- to me, things have been censored out that shouldn't have and they've left the things that shouldn't, you know, that the things that should be there, they've taken away and the things that shouldn't be there, they're leaving there --
L:  That's right.  That's right.
R:  -- and so that's why we've chosen to, you know, do private school, because we want our child in a Christian environment and, you know, like that, so --
L:  Well, I just mm I think if you start saying that any teacher, no matter who, in any school, in any grade, can produce any -- any textbook and it's okay.  I mean, that's leaving the fate of children in one person's hands, you know.
R:  Right.  Right.  And I hate to say it, but a lot of teachers are not teaching just because they love children and they love to teach, they're teaching for the dollar and for the hours, you know.  And they're not --
L:  Well --
R:  -- concerned, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- some of them are not concerned as they should be about what -- what's going into our children's heads.  And --
L:  On -- on the other hand, I think that teachers are expected more and more to do parental jobs, like teaching --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- discipline and teaching manners and -- and that's not right.
R:  Right.  And that's not their job.  It's the parents' job.  They're putting way too much onto the teachers --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- you know, by doing this.
L:  And -- and not only that, I -- I have many friends who are teachers um, they get a class of kids and they're expected to teach at whatever level each child is --
R:  Right.  And that's almost impossible.
L:  Yeah.  Well, now, I just -- I think if -- if we already have a law, or if it comes down about ah that -- about textbooks, I -- I [LIPSMACK] I tell you, I just cannot see allowing whatever books into schools, whether it's in the classroom or whether it's in the library.
R:  Right.  I feel it should be a joint decision between the parents, the teachers, the school board, you know, everyone should have a say in -- in what book, you know, if they have to bring it to a vote or whatever, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know exactly how that would be handled because I've never really dealt with the educational system, you know, just having a kindergartener, but --
L:  Yes.  Yeah.  Well, and each -- each State, each school district, each school, you know, they're all a little bit different, but it sounded like this question was wanting this to be a law all over.
R:  Right.  That's kind of what I understood too.
L:  But they don't give you a whole lot of direction [LAUGH].
R:  No [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I was like --
R:  [inaudible] --
L:  -- okay.  Now what? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I just signed up yesterday, or the day before.
R:  I signed up today.
L:  Hm.  Well, I -- I thought, "Well, I do surveys through the mail and surveys on the Internet, so I was willing to give it a try and see what happened".
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  But I guess you don't know what subject they're going to throw at you until you get the call.
R:  That makes it kind of hard --
L:  That's what it sounded like --
R:  -- to think of [inaudible] [LAUGH] I like to try to research something and at least be a little educated on it before --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I begin trying to speak about it.
L:  I wo- I wonder what happens if we say, "Uh-huh, we don't have an opinion on this subject" 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I suspect we wouldn't get paid for it.
R:  Mm.  Probably not. 
L:  But I'm glad to see that somebody is doing these types of surveys and hopefully the information that the general public, you and I, submit to them does some good.  Does some reinforcing.
R:  Right.  So that, you know, so that our views on things like censorship would be at least considered before they do bring something like this into law or -- I don't even know if it is a law now, you know?
L:  Well, I'm -- in my school district, I'm fairly certain it is not, even though I do not have children in school anymore, my husband drives school bus for the school district, so ah we kind of know what goes on and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that kind of thing and however we're ah -- um, a rural school district, a fairly good sized one, but a rural school district and um we do things ah -- a lot betterer than I have seen in some of the city school districts, I think.
R:  Right.  We --
L:  ah --
R:  -- we live in town and we've got a, you know, a city school district here that's supposed to be really great and they held on to things like doing the pledge and things like that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as long as they could and then last year, you know, some students started putting lawsuits against the school and things like that and so they've had to completely take, you know, all of that out --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because people are so lawsuit happy.
L:  Well, I don't -- it -- it's just [LIPSMACK] they're -- they're just tying the hands of the -- of the school districts and the -- the people in charge who, you know, it's not right.  It ought to be whatever the people in that district feel, I guess --
R:  Right.
L:  -- there might be, you know, big cities and where -- where people want to have that kind of a thing, but I can't imagine it.  Ah, as it is, children get access to way, way more than what they should and it ought to be safe in the schools.
R:  Yes, it should be because that's -- you know, that's the one place you can't go and watch what your child's doing, you have no idea what's going on there --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- when you're not there.  You know, that's the one place that you can't go and sit with them all the ti- you can watch them
