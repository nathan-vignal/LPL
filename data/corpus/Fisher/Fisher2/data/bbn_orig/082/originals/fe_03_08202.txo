R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, I'm Stephanie.
L:  I'm Kim.
R:  I didn't hear the question.  What was it?
L:  It was something about, "Do you think that public or private schools have the right to tell children what books to read?" or something like that.  They said it like real fast.
R:  It beeped on me.
L:  I d- this is my first survey type of thing with the --
R:  Mine too.
L:  -- so -- okay.
R:  Mine too [LAUGH].
L:  So, I think, okay, I didn't know I was going to be speaking with somebody, but that's cool --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN] I don't think it's right, but that's just me.
L:  Well, my daughter goes to a private school, but I mean I don't -- I mean I think each child, their own individuality or whatever, you know --
R:  I think it's more about the parents.
L:  Right.
R:  I don't -- I don't think schools should ever say, "Well, you can read this, or you have to read it" --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because what if the parents don't want 'em -- want 'em reading it.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, my son's only one, but so I mean --
L:  See, mine's eleven and a half and there's some things that I would let my daughter do that sh- her school didn't approve of [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- to a point.  But I mean, you know --
R:  I have an eleven year old brother.
L:  Mm.
R:  And I, you know, he comes over here and I let him read stuff that maybe I shouldn't let him read, I guess --
L:  Yeah.  Are you on AOL or no?
R:  Yeah.
L:  There's Harry Potter stuff on there, I know, maybe or --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Are you in any of the um, do you go on the freebies online and all that kind of stuff?
R:  I go to the message chats.
L:  Oh really?  What's your screen name?
R:  Stephie, C.C.E.
L:  C.C.E.?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  Mine's Kim Twenty Four Fan.  I didn't know if you -- I don't know if -- I was going to say, well that'd be wild if it was somebody I -- you know, kind of new or had seen me, the name on the screen a lot.
R:  I think you might go to the same board I do.
L:  Probably.  It's --
R:  The freebies board?
L:  Yeah.  Fre- freebies and deals and stuff like that.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  M- the moms online one?
R:  Maybe.
L:  Huh.
R:  I'm the one that sells Avon, if that makes it any easier.
L:  Probably seen it in your um ah screen name or something like that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- do you have a -- a signature thingy?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Let's see, favorite places I go to, it's just classified ads and then um --
R:  I go there.
L:  -- Parenting community message boards, classified ads and then it's freebies and deals.
R:  I just go to freebies.
L:  Oh, cool.  So, what are we supposed to be -- is that what we're supposed to be doing, talking about that and that's it?
R:  Yeah, it's what we're supposed to be talking about.
L:  Oh, and then they tell us ten minutes is up?
R:  Yeah, I guess [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That works.
L:  Okay.  Well, now that we ah figured that one out [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I ain't never done that before and then --
R:  No.
L:  -- do they pay us by pay pal or send a check in the mail?
R:  I think they --
L:  Or do we get points?
R:  I think they send you a check in the mail.
L:  I sign up for everything.  I don't even know what I'll get anymore.
R:  I do too.
L:  I mean, even like today.  Where are you at?  What State are you in?
R:  In New York.
L:  Oh really?  I'm in Florida.
R:  Oh.
L:  I got some free dry line erase sample thingy or whatever.
R:  I --
L:  You know what, the only thing is I wonder --
R:  I -- 
L:  -- if they're taping us [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, they are.
L:  You know.
R:  I got a free sponge.
L:  A free sponge?  That's cool.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't --
R:  I think they're taping us and we're supposed to be talking about the books and letting our children read them --
L:  I guess.
R:  -- and the schools allowing it.  Private schools are different though.  Yours --
L:  That's all it said was um I guess the discussion should be about, um, do you agree whether or not public or private schools should tell your children what to read or what not to read or tell you what to read or what not to read, something like that?
R:  Well, I don't agree.
L:  Well, my daughter, she's in -- she's in a private education --
R:  Is she?
L:  -- but it's um um they have their own curriculum, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But -- and I agree with it, I mean, that's all -- that's fine, you know, but actually books, you know, I mean --
R:  Well, there's like some parents who are like against our children reading like Romeo and Juliet and stuff like that --
L:  Right.  Right.  See, one thing, I mean I don't -- I don't know a lot about like the Harry Potter stuff, but --
R:  Oh, it's a -- it's a great book [LAUGH].
L:  -- see, but a lot of people say that but of course the Christian schools, you know, they think it's all wizardry and witchcraft and that kind of stuff --
R:  It's not.  It -- it's -- it's --
L:  -- and --
R:  -- wiza- yeah, a lot of, yeah, my um friend's daughter goes to a Catholic school and they're not allowed to read that there and I think that's ridiculous --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because it's not -- it, you know, it works through imagination --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if a child has an imag- doesn't have an imagination they're going to be a very boring child.
L:  Right.  Well, I mean and I think to each their own, like my daughter.  If I would have told her, "No, you're not allowed to read that" or the school told her, no she's not allowed to read that, then she would be curious and want to read it.
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.
L:  I never said anything about it, just because I thought, "Well, she can form her opinion" I mean, she is eleven years old, I mean she can see for herself because she doesn't like -- I mean, not that it's scary, but she doesn't like getting scary or scary movies or stuff like that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, witches and that kind of stuff.  But anyway, she just never took onto the Harry Potter --
R:  See, my --
L:  -- so she had interest.
R:  -- my son will watch the movies --
L:  Oh really?
R:  -- he's only one, but he gets so into the movies --
L:  [LAUGH]  But I mean --
R:  -- and --
L:  -- I didn't -- I -- because I didn't say, you know, I think if you say, "No, you're not" you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't -- I would rather you not, it's bad, blah, blah, blah, then the child's gonna like, "Well, let me just --" --
R:  Well then, yeah.
L:  "-- see what" yeah, exactly.  You know.  W- --
R:  See, growing up, my mom never, you know, I read what I read.  You know what I mean?
L:  Right.
R:  It didn't matter what I -- I mean, when I was younger she read the books first, then let me read them, but I was interested in all the stuff that all the other kids were reading too, so --
L:  Oh, of course.  Of course.  How old are you?
R:  I'm twenty two.
L:  Twenty -- oh wow.  And you have -- oh, you have an eleven year old brother.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  A brother.
L:  An eleven year old son.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm thirty five.  [SIGH] But um --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you know, I -- that was the only one that I -- it didn't matter to me if she got into it, just like Halloween.  I mean, Halloween is what you make out of it.  You know, if I d- dressed her up as a witch or whatever, you know, it's what you make out of it.  Or if she wants to go as a cowgirl, you know, it's --
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.
L:  -- you don't have to tell them, it's, you know, everybody thinks it's satanic and stuff like that, you know.  I -- you know, so --
R:  See, I wouldn't let my children, see I -- I've -- I wouldn't let my son read something like that, like about all the devil and stuff --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I wouldn't let him read that.  And I don't think a school's going to say, "You can read this".
L:  Right.  Right.  Right.
R:  But a school's not going to say, "You can't read it" which --
L:  See, she's been in private education from K, you know, K Five, you know, kindergarten --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so I, you know, she knows no other.  Now, if she now went into the sixth grade into a public school, she would be shocked --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because it would be a really, really, really [LAUGH] bad culture change for her, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in a -- not I mean bad, bad, but I mean, sh- it's not something that she would be used to doing, you know --
R:  No.  My friend to a um Catholic schools her whole life until seventh grade.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And sh- they teach you, your children are so much ahead of regular kids in public schooling.
L:  They are.  And the -- her -- the school that she's going to, she gets by with Bs and Cs.  I mean, there's a lot of them that do straight As, but the stuff that she's doing in fifth grade I know, I know I never did that even in high school --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I know.
R:  The stuff --
L:  Because I can't help her with it.
R:  -- the stuff my brother brings home, like all this math stuff --
L:  Mhm.  Right.
R:  -- I like, "Y- you expect me to help you with that?" --
L:  Chris, yeah, she is in like pre +algebra -- algebra stuff --
R:  I did that in ninth grade.
L:  -- and I took general math and I took bookkeeping and that's it.
R:  I took algebra in ninth grade, but don't ask me it.
L:  And that was twenty years ago.  So, i- I, you know, for me to sit here and help her and I'm like, "Oh my.  You better ask the teacher, you better bring home the -- the math book" --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, and we can re read it together, you know.
R:  You better call a friend [LAUGH].
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.  How about just a good educated guess. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I -- I couldn't do that.  That stuff they -- they have those kids learning so much stuff and it's like, I don't understand it.
L:  Right.  I know.  I mean, in a way I -- I kind of -- you know, I mean it -- it's nice because I'm paying for it, I mean I'm paying for her education more or less --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it's like, you know, you really figure you're getting your money's worth, but gosh it's like, "Could you please not shove so much down her throat at once" --
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.  Let them grasp it all and then go from there.  You know?
R:  Yeah.  And don't --
L:  But --
R:  -- and don't make 'em choose what books to read [LAUGH].
L:  Right.  Well, ch- well --
R:  Well, I mean, going to a Catholic school of course they're not going to say, "You can't worship the Devil here", obviously.
L:  Right.  Right.  They're going to have their opinions, but they should have that stated when you sign up for that school, or something like that.  Or maybe they should have a list, you know, these are the books that we choose to read during our reading sessions, or something.  You know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- not that it's mandatory, but I wouldn't like it if I signed my daughter up for a school and then all of a s- then you found out about that, you know?
R:  See, I -- my mom -- when I was in sixth grade we were given books that we had to read with the class --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- but my mom just didn't care as long as I did the work and got, you know, good grades, it didn't matter what I was reading as long as I was doing the grades.
L:  Right.
R:  In a way, I don't think the school had a right to say, "You have to read this book" but at the same time I grew to like the books that I read.
L:  Right.  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  See, I went to -- I went to private education, kindergarten to sixth gr- fifth grade.  Sixth and seventh I went to a um ah public school and then ninth to twelfth I went to a  private school.  So, but we were never told, then we were never told what to read.  We -- we had our own curriculum, but we were never told anything to read, you know, or anything we could read or couldn't read.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So.  I don't know.
R:  I don't think --
L:  I never -- 
R:  I know.
L:  -- I never knew that that was ever really an issue, but I guess maybe they just want opinions on that kind of a topic, I guess.
R:  Maybe.  It makes no sense to me.  I don't --
L:  Well, it's been eleven minutes.
R:  -- it's not a big deal.
L:  I guess they'll say something.
R:  My phone only says nine and a half minutes. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh okay.  Mine's fast.  I guess it said, what, that they'll tell you when it's ten minutes is up or something like that?
R:  And then we can leave comments.
L:  Okay.  I guess.
R:  I guess so.
L:  Huh.  So, this is your first one, too?
R:  Yeah.  I just got a call today asking if I'd be -- I signed up for it and then today I got the information saying I could sign up for it if I wanted to.
L:  I think I signed up yesterday, or the day before because, I mean, I like sat on there like all day long and did, you know, freebies and sur- surveys and all that kind of stuff.
R:  I do that everyday.
L:  Every day.  I know.  And ah well I do it two hours at nap time, because I do in home daycare, so I'll get on there at noon to two and then I, you know [MN] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- type so fast.  But and I signed up for this one, so, oh well, if they call, they call and then when I seen it said something -- some school in Pennsylvania or something and then I said, okay, I'll answer it.
R:  I usually don't answer it if I don't know who it is.
L:  Normally I don't either, but I guess now I'm going to have to [LAUGH].
R:  I got an email saying what it would say.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, I haven't turned mine on yet because I had to go take my dog to the vet today.  Haven't been on there.  But, oh well, that's interesting.  I never had a survey where I actually conversed with a person.
R:  Me neither.  It's usually on the Internet.
L:  Yeah.  Or check yes or no, or whatever, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  With a m- mouse clicker thingy.  But anyway.  So, you're in New York?
R:  Yeah.  And that's -- it's like Florida up here.  Someone should let Mother Nature know that we're not in Florida.
L:  Oh, my word.  It's humid down here.  Hot and humid.
R:  Yeah.
