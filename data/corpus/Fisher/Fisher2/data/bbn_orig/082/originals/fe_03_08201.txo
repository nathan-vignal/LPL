L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  My name is Donny.
L:  Um, my name is Cara.
R:  Hi, Cara.
L:  Hi, how are you today?
R:  I'm pretty good [LAUGH].
L:  So, what do you think about um schools --
R:  Books [several inaudible words]?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I'm not really sure, actually.  I sort of -- my immediate feeling is um anti censorship --
L:  Right.
R:  -- at the same time, um, I imagine there are some books that I wouldn't feel comfortable with my kids reading --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but I don't know who's job it is to make that decision, so my -- my basic answer would be no.  Like most of the books that have been -- have been censored in schools, I have a problem with them being censored and I think it's kind of ridiculous.
L:  Right.
R:  Um -- what do you think?
L:  Um, well, you know, there are obvious things that I wouldn't want children to read in schools like, ah, you know, pornography or inappropriate material such as that but, you know, as far as like ah those books that are censored now, they just, you know, they're radical ideas but they're not, you know, filth or anything, so I don't think --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I don't think that, you know, a school should just step in and decide like what's appropriate and what's not appropriate, I think that just aside from like obvious pornography and inappropriate material I think that other books should be allowed.
R:  Well, it's just that -- that's -- that's sort of ah a confusing area, it's like such a grey area though, because for what you might think is obvious pornography and what I might think is obvious pornography might be totally different and someone that's like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- has a very religious [inaudible] may feel a certain way about --
L:  Right.
R:  -- certain -- certain language and that being inappropriate --
L:  Right.
R:  -- ah --
L:  Well, ultimately um, you know, it could just be put out there and then it could be up for the parents to decide what's appropriate for their children.
R:  That's true, but then how do you -- how do you have like a class discussion or -- or you just wait until all the parents agree on, on certain materials or anything that's questionable you have to get like a permission slip for?
L:  Um, yeah, maybe.  I mean like how when I was in school you had to get a permission slip for sex education --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, and not everybody's parents were comfortable with that being discussed and the children who weren't, you know, given permission, they would just ah you know, go somewhere, go to the library while that was discussed --
R:  Right.  Seems like that --
L:  But I mean mo- most of the books that you read in school now, you know, pretty much everybody agrees on them.
R:  Um, I mean I haven't heard about any strange censorship lately, but I mean things like Huck Finn being censored or like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- books that just aren't -- aren't included --
L:  Right.
R:  -- more of li- a- a- what bothers me more is like sort of the -- the undiscussed censorship in the way it -- that -- that books are chosen in the first place, or books are not chosen in the first place and so a big deal is not necessarily made out of it because it's not --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- even brought up as an issue um--
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but I've just seen like we still use a lot of ah like very I guess we call them the classics, you know, it's definitely I think the classics are important --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but we leave out a lot of ah contemporary +literature -- literature --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in schools as well just because some of the ideas expressed in there are not quote unquote appropriate.
L:  Right.
R:  Um I don't know.
L:  But I mean -- I mean, definitely like um public schools, that's like, you know, that's something different for private schools.  I think that, um, you know, a lot of the private schools that don't get funding from the state, I think that they can ah, you know, have the right to like choose what they include in their libraries --
R:  I agree --
L:  -- and --
R:  -- but I think that's a different -- a different subject entirely, I mean if you're --
L:  I mean, yes, if you go to like a parochial school you're learning about religion and, you know, in public schools they don't teach that.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I think that there is like different sets of standards.
R:  That's true.  And I guess if the government isn't supporting the edu- you know, the educational system that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that you're in then -- then it's the people running it have the option to censor whatever they feel like censoring and that and you just sort of you agreed to adhere to that if you decide to send your child to that school.
L:  Right.  I mean, they don't, you know, like they don't teach evolution in parochial schools, so I'm sure they wouldn't have books pertaining to evolution in their library --
R:  Right.
L:  [MN]
R:  Hm.  Fascinating [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But public school, I mean, that I think is definitely more of an issue of -- of who's making the decisions to -- of what can be -- what's censored and what's not.
L:  Right.  I mean, you -- you can't like -- you can't please everybody all the time.
R:  No, you definitely cannot.
L:  Public schools, you know, they're comprised of like such a myriad of different ethnicities and races and people that come from different cultures and different value systems, so, you know, to like a fundamentalist like ah muslim, Huck Finn might be very objectionable, but to, like, you know, you or I it might be, you know, perfectly fine.
R:  Right.  Huh.  I wonder who d- who does make those choices, you know?  Is it like the school --
L:  Um --
R:  -- board or --
L:  I think -- I think it's the school board.  [NOISE] Because I think that in like -- like ah say in like rural Tennessee I think like certain books are banned that wouldn't be banned in like New York.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I think like the individual --
R:  Well --
L:  -- like school system decides.
R:  I think another interesting aspect of that is that um in -- in the whole censoring of books or -- or ideas you're sort of sending a message to the kids as well --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that's not -- and -- that's not necessarily a positive message of --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, you can't read this, this isn't appropriate, which is sort of like forcing them to well, hopefully maybe, forcing them to go read the forbidden book.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.  Um, -- 
L:  I think also the more you tell a child that they can't read something, the more they're going to want to read it.
R:  Right.  That's what I'm saying, ah --
L:  Yeah.  And also --
R:  Which is maybe good.
L:  I mean --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- reading a book -- reading a book is a good thing as long as it's not really, really like, you know, I mean I wouldn't want a child of mine reading like, you know, Nazi propaganda, but [NOISE] --
R:  Well, wouldn't you w- wouldn't you be interested in possibly reading it just for -- for the sake of -- of seeing someone else's view --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and not necessary having to agree, I mean hopefully not agreeing --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- but --
L:  Yeah.  I -- I don't think I would be f- comfortable with like the school boards deciding that for me though.
R:  That's -- that's true.  I just th- I think that's my main problem with censorship, is --
L:  Right.
R:  -- is that what are you -- just like, what are you actually censoring and how harmful is it?  Is it more harmful --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to -- to censor something that you think is i- reading, or is it more appropriate to like have some sort of educated --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- discussion of these things that you may or may not just, you know, agree with.  We live in a culture and society and country that's based on, you know, freedom of speech and ideas --
L:  Right.  That's true.
R:  -- and so it's hard -- sort of hard -- it's a double edged sword, you know?
L:  Right.  It shouldn't just be freedom --
R:  But --
L:  -- of speech if you agree with it, it should be freedom of speech no matter what the message is --
R:  Right.  It needs to be a hundred percent.
L:  Right.
R:  And so, again, like does that apply to an eight year old?  I, you know, when you still have some say in as -- as to what they're --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they're filtering or --
L:  I -- I guess it's like I said, I guess it's ah just like a judgment call because maybe -- maybe it is a good idea for a child to read, you know, Nazi propaganda, but maybe it's not appropriate for an eight year old, maybe it's appropriate for a fourteen year old when they can better understand the ideas.
R:  Right.
L:  Because eight year olds are more impressionable that somebody who's older than that.
R:  Right.  Hm.
L:  And also, like, you know, schools can censor books but I mean as soon as the child comes home they could watch like all sorts of violence on the television.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, it's really in the long run, it's ultimately up to the parents [NOISE].
R:  Well, that's what seems silly about it, is a lot of the books that -- that p- that have been censored are not even remotely near the level of what's on television or in magazines or, you know, um, what kids are going to see anyway.
L:  Right.
R:  It seems.  You know.  They're not talking about censoring like pornography books, they're talking about censoring like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- classic literature generally and things -- things --
L:  Right.  I definitely don't think that ah books like that should be banned.
R:  Hm.  Okay.
L:  I mean, I -- I -- like growing up, I read all sorts of controversial books and I'm not like, you know, any the worse for it.  You know, it's just good to know that there are these ou- ideas out there and you can like get a better grasp on the world by reading other people's ideas, even if they're different from your own.
R:  So, I guess it all does sort of come back to the parents and having that --
L:  Right.  And what kind of values are -- are, you know, promoted in your household.
R:  Right.  And that way it wouldn't, I guess, matter what was censored and what wasn't because you would be encouraged to --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to look at all aspects of the world.
L:  Right.  I mean, if my child --
R:  Ah --
L:  -- came home and said, "Ah, Huckleberry Finn has been +censored -- censored in my school and I'd like to read it" I would just, you know, go get it for them and let them read it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so I mean, I guess in the long run it -- it's -- it's kinda wrong, but it wouldn't really --
