R:  [NOISE] Hi there -- 
L:  Hello.
R:  -- how are you?
L:  Good.  How are you?
R:  Good.  My name's Karen.
L:  I'm Lydia.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  So what do you think? [SIGH] 
L:  Um, I don't think so. [LAUGH] I think they should --
R:  I agree with you.
L:  -- I think they should be able to read -- especially reading. [SIGH] They should be able to read what they want to read.
R:  Well yeah, because otherwise if we -- if they +censored all that stuff then -- I mean, how -- you'd just have a bunch of programmed kids --
L:  Right.
R:  -- who are programmed into thinking whatever you want them to think.
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  Instead of whatever, you know [MN] -- you know, based off of if they read their own stuff they could make their own, you know, thoughts and processes --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- about stuff.
L:  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK] I think reading's a good thing. [LAUGH] I mean [SIGH] the more you read the better off you're going to be.
R:  Well --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and then you can -- you know you can compare authors and stuff like that --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- 'cause I know there is some -- like when I was in high school they -- they didn't let us or didn't require us to read you know, certain authors but then other high schools were doing that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So ... [NOISE] and then I think sometimes they +censor when they write books too. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh really?
R:  Yeah, because I have read that there are some history books that they've left out --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- you know, certain things about um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like the civil rights and um --
L:  Mhm.  [NOISE] That's true.  Yeah.  I took a history class and [SIGH] the professor thought that different books were slanted --
R:  Right.
L:  -- according to how the authors felt. [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  See in that way if they -- you know -- if they didn't let you read multiple authors of the same subject then you wouldn't be able to come to that conclusion.
L:  Mhm.  [NOISE] Right.  Yeah, because you al- -- well, I always thought history books were -- were "It". [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  It was the way it was until I took that class and then [SIGH] -- I don't know, I never thought of it that way.
R:  Right.  You would think, "Okay, these people are supposed to be representing history" --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- and then when they slant it a certain way --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- that is censorship in its own right.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And here you are thinking you're reading about history and then you find out maybe that wasn't exactly the way it happened. [LAUGH]
L:  Right. [LAUGH] Well, that's interesting. [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah, I was wondering when they said the topic was censorship if -- what it was going to be.  If it was going to be TV or books --
L:  Mm.
R:  or ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, whatever.
L:  No, as far as books are concerned I think reading is a good thing [LAUGH] --
R:  Right and then --
L:  -- wish my kids did more of it.
R:  Right and then, yeah.  They should definitely encourage it in school.
L:  Mhm.  Right, good.  Of course --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- my kids came from a private school.  [LIPSMACK] They would probably censor a lot of things. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, and I probably -- I probably think that a lot of private schools probably do tend to do that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  'Cause my son used to go to a private school too and um I think they tend -- and it was a religious -- religious --
L:  Right.
R:  -- private school --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and yeah, they tend to --
L:  It's --
R:  -- slant things that way too.
L:  [NOISE] Right.  So, I don't know.  [NOISE] Then they have to go out in the big world and [LAUGH] read what they -- hopefully read what they [SIGH] can.
R:  Right.  See, that's why the whole censorship in schools shouldn't be allowed because otherwise you know they grow up for thirteen years thinking one way and then often they read a book and they'll, "Oh".  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, the censorship is also kind of like um [LIPSMACK] not real obvious.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, I mean [MN] they don't even know they're being censored.
R:  Right.
L:  By just um allowing them or ... um, it's not really allowing them but they're [SIGH] um -- the less the books that they get are -- have been in a way censored, I mean they -- they're not going to put things in there that they don't think they should be reading [SIGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they think they should be reading. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  I mean I think that you know in the public schools there should be like a -- you know a common denominator on what books they should read and -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, whether you go read something else is your own --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- choosing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But they shouldn't, you know, censorsh- -- you know, put censorship on certain books because they want the kids in that school to think a certain way.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.  I wonder what kind of censorship they're talking about though.  I mean --
R:  Yeah.  See, this whole question could be slanted a different way.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  And maybe that's why they want people to talk about it. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  You know, 'cause whoever's doing the study may not -- you know, they're thinking one way on censorship and then --
L:  Yeah, that's pretty broad and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- general.  I mean, censorship to w- what extent?
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, there's things that different ages shouldn't be reading.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean I agree with that but, [SIGH] I don't know.  It's kind of hard to tell what they're -- we're talking about. [LAUGH]
R:  Well yeah.  I mean, you can yeah, like you say y- mean you don't want, you know, second or third graders reading about sex or something like that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but then --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that might be more age appropriate down the road or whatever.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  You know?
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  So yeah, I would say there's different levels of censorship too. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.  You can't just let them go at it. [LAUGH] 
R:  No.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Hm.
R:  Yeah.  Interesting topic.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, it is.  Well, I'm glad my kids are out. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Mine are small still.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Four and eight so ...
L:  Oh wow. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Got a ways to go.
R:  Yup. [SIGH] See, and you don't even think about that kind of stuff until, you know, somebody poses the question.
L:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] I know.  And then when I heard it I thought of it one way but then the more we're talking there could be yeah --
R:  Right.
L:  -- there's all different kinds of censorship.  I don't know [NOISE] what they're talking about. 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I mean, what kind of censorship? [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE] Right.  Yeah --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- that's why you know, like we said you know, in a religious school --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they may not let them read a certain book well, where in the public schools they would.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, depending on what they're -- you know what their curriculum is and that kind of stuff.
L:  Right.  Well, I think age appropriate kind of censorship would be --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- is a good thing but [SIGH] I don't know, this [SIGH] ...
R:  Age appropriate and then within the -- the censorship itself it's going to kind of, you know -- you don't want to censor what authors and that kind of stuff they're going to read.
L:  Right, right.
R:  I mean I think age appropriate probably covers the whole thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But then I suppose some parents out there might think some things are more age appropriate than others and then you get into a whole -nother realm of stuff.
L:  Oh, that's true. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Opens up another can of w- -- er worms.
R:  Well, yeah.  There are some wacked up parents out there that --
L:  [MN] [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know think, you know, certain kinds of books are okay for kids to read.
L:  Yeah.  Hm.  I don't know.  I [MN] -- I don't know.  And then who's -- who's the one that's capable of the censorship. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  I mean I'm -- I'm probably more liberal than a lot of parents though.  I don't know. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  'Cause I wouldn't -- I mean -- I'm not saying I would let them read any thing but [SIGH] I'm sure more -- more parents are a lot more uptight than I would be.
R:  Right.  And that's where like I agree with you.  The age appropriateness pretty much takes care of itself.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean that's why people read -- I mean write towards the age group.
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  [NOISE] And there are certain, you know, magazines and that kind of stuff they don't let you talk about certain things to certain age groups so that pretty much censors [NOISE] itself.
L:  Mhm.  Hm.  [NOISE] Censorship. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Uh.  I mean I thought grown up and my -- you know, my mom didn't really say I couldn't read certain things, but I always had, like you said, an age appropriate list that I got from my teacher -- [NOISE]
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, you know, worked from there.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I guess, at a certain age, you know, with your fourth and fifth grade, certain books aren't going to interest you anyway because they're way too hard reading.
L:  [NOISE] Right. [NOISE] Hm.
R:  But there's even people out there you know -- I let my son read and I read to him the Harry Potter books, but there's a lot of people that think that there's things in there that --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know, have to do with the devil and all that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- stuff, and it's like, "No it's just pure fantasy".
L:  Especially the religious schools. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm sure that is Xed out of their book list. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Ah, the school that my kids went to -- there's no way. [LAUGH] I mean they're --
R:  I mean they're really -- and it -- it is strictly fantasy and if you would, you know, ever have listened to the author who wrote it, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- she said, "No".  You know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- she's not talking about the devil and that kind of stuff.  That's silly.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.  Reading is a good thing. [SIGH] To -- I don't know -- to censor it --
R:  Well, you know like my son, he has a hard time writing and reading is the only thing that helps with that skill --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so it's we have to let him --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, read.
L:  It's going to help you in all different areas of your life.
R:  Right.  Like my father in law.  He never really learned how to read right so he still to this day -- and he's in his seventies and he doesn't read very well.
L:  Mm.  [NOISE] Yeah.  It really wasn't encouraged when I was growing up but I certainly encourage my kids.
R:  Right.  [NOISE] And that's almost -- almost like censorship in itself.  Not encourage reading. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Right.  It is.
