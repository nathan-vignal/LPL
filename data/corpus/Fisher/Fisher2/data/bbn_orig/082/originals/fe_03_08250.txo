L:  [NOISE] Hi, my name is Chastity.
R:  Hi, my name is Sue.  How are you?
L:  I'm fine.
R:  Good.
L:  How are you?
R:  I'm well thank you.  I --
L:  Good.
R:  -- I think there's --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- two parts to the question. [NOISE] 
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  I think it's public schools and then there's private schools.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] I think public [NOISE] schools --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- except for age -- like age when it's in vocabulary and stuff --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I [NOISE] really think that there's no reason [NOISE] to censor any --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- any books [NOISE] for kids.  A- aside from pornography. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.  That most definitely [NOISE] does need to be out. [NOISE] Um --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- as far as material --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- reading material -- um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- as far as content of the books --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- I think there shouldn't be any censorship. [NOISE] I don't -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I don't remember being --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- censored [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh a- --
L:  -- at school.
R:  No, I don't either.  Um --
L:  But um -- and I don't think [NOISE] there was --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [NOISE] anything -- we didn't read anything bad. [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] No.  Um, [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know I think the parents --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- should be able to find out -- the school --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- should tell the parents --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- "This is what we're reading" [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and if you want an alternative [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um [SIGH] [NOISE] for a certain book --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [NOISE] then you should be able --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- to have your kid read an alternative but ...
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH] [NOISE] 
L:  And it's up to the -- I think it's up to the teachers.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  The curriculum, [NOISE] uh -- uh and it should be [NOISE] age appropriate.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think it does --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- definitely age appropriate.
R:  Well, you get into --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- grey areas with age -- being age appropriate.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- my son is almost twelve. [NOISE] 
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  He's reading at a junior high school comprehension level. [NOISE] 
L:  Wow, that's great. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, and uh -- which is great and if I had him reading --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [NOISE] w- what somebody considered age appropriate for an eleven year old --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- he'd be bored silly. [NOISE] 
L:  He'd be reading kid books. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] Yeah um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, I try to police what he reads --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and to steer him toward --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, the classics I suppose you could say --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  -- um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- but he's loved the Harry Potter books.  He's just eaten [NOISE] those -- been eating those up.
L:  [NOISE] My. [LAUGH] 
R:  You know.  [NOISE] Um ...
L:  At -- at that has a -- I think that would be a personal with the [NOISE] parents because --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I know, personally, um I would never read them and I don't want my children to read them --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  -- just because I don't --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- believe in that -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- in tho- -- in those fiction.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  But I still don't believe --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- in +witchcraft I guess. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  Um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- so I think it's up [NOISE] to the --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- parents -- ultimately up to the parents, like you said.  Um, if --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- my daughter [SIGH] -- she's touched pre-K this fall --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and so I don't have any --
R:  Hm, you don't have --
L:  -- school age yet.  [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah, you don't have those issues yet.
L:  I don't have this issue yet and my children will be attending [NOISE] -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they will go to military schools.  We're a military family.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] So um -- [NOISE] 
R:  Are those essentially more similar to a --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- public school?
L:  They're a public school right, but with little, [NOISE] I guess more restrictions --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- on -- [NOISE] on things.  Um, [NOISE] so I'm not really sure what the --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [NOISE] curriculum is on those --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- but uh, so I don't know if --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I would w- -- I would hope --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that [NOISE] like you said, the teacher [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- would send a note saying you know, "This is what we are going to be reading this [NOISE] week".
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  Um, part a --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- permission slip. [NOISE] 
R:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] Maybe not a permission slip but --
L:  But -- [NOISE] 
R:  -- but a -- [NOISE] and especially as you're getting older and they're getting into --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [NOISE] things that could be questionable.
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] Um [MN] the bottom line --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- gets down to parents knowing --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- what the kids are up to.
L:  Right.  And it -- that's -- that's true.  If the parent is not involved in what their children are doing in school --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- then they don't know and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that is -- that's definitely a question.  And a [NOISE] dif- different issue is getting parents involved.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Um --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- I know I'm go- -- I'm gonna try to be definitely involved in my [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- children's schools.
R:  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  And uh to -- to know what's going on.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, I mean --
L:  It's --
R:  -- I think private schools are a different matter. [NOISE] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  If you --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- pick a private school for whatever the reason [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, if it's a Catholic school --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- here we have a lot of ah charter schools --
L:  Right.
R:  -- which are run by private companies --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and some of them are religious oriented --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- you know.  There's -- there's a whole variety of them.  We've also got --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- Friends schools -- Quaker schools --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- around here which are --
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  -- private but they don't [SIGH] -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it's more of a private academy.  It's not like a Catholic school where you have [NOISE] -- you wouldn't have a religion course in a Friends school.  You just call them Friends schools.
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  And they're very high academics. [NOISE] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] Ah, I see.
R:  It's pretty neat actually.
L:  That does sound neat.  That would --
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE] Ah, they teach a lot of tolerance and -- and that kind of thing.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, as far as [SIGH] [NOISE] -- I mean insofar as Quakers are really heavy into --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- tolerance and -- and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- personal freedom and that kind of stuff.  They're --
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  -- I guess you'd say there's a religious bent to them but it's --
L:  It's more of a ... [PAUSE] 
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  Um, it's a tolerance type thing.
R:  Yeah.  It's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- more like social justice and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- y- you know, it's not like, "Well, you have to read this book of the Bible and believe in it --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- doing it this way".  It's what you do, not necessarily how you do it.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  Uh, and there's a lot of Catholic schools around here too. [SIGH] [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah, there's a few here.  [NOISE] Oh, there's one here and --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- um, I know we have --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- people who --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [NOISE] um [LIPSMACK] are -- I know a lot of people who home school [NOISE] now --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- their children and --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- [MN] [NOISE] because of -- of religious reasons.  And um [NOISE] some of them do take their kids to private schools, but the problem is, you know [NOISE] -- is getting into the Catholic school system.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you know, they have to do what the [NOISE] Catholics say --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- and if that goes against your, [NOISE] you know, beliefs then that's --
R:  Oh -- oh, I know a lot of people choose Catholic schools 'cause they're seen as better acade- academically.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  Especially if you're talking in -- I live in -- near -- live near Philadelphia --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and the public schools in the city are [SIGH] -- it's a big city school system so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's got all those problems.  A lot of people choose Catholic schools just [SIGH] because they want --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the discipline and they want the -- the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know.  They -- they're perceived as being better academically and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- especially the high schools they are.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you know, I don't honestly know if they make you take a religion class if you're not Catholic.
L:  I dunno -- I'm not really -- don't -- I'm not familiar with that.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I don't -- I don't really know. [NOISE] 
R:  No.  I mean, when I was little I went to Catholic school but [NOISE] --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- [NOISE] we -- we're Catholics so -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know.
L:  That helped. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, it helped.  Um, it was a long time ago. [LAUGH]  But I think you gotta give your kids -- you've got to give your st- your kids the right tools --
L:  Right.
R:  -- for th- -- as they get older --
L:  I think it --
R:  -- and they're in these situations, they can say, "Well, [MN] this is a bad thing, this is --"  
L:  Right.
R:  "-- a good thing" and -- and --
L:  Uh, I think as parents it's part of our job.  It's not just up to the teachers.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think, as parents, that's part of what we need to teach.  We need to teach our children at home.  It all starts at home too. [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  And the foundation starts at home.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  You know, the teachers kinda expand on that.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I mean, the teacher has expertise I don't have, obviously -- 
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  -- in yeah, science, in geography --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- and -- and -- 
L:  Exactly.
R:  [NOISE] But we've always encouraged our son to read -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, to read stuff that's even --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- a little bit [SIGH] -- as far as um [NOISE] themes and vocabulary and stuff, a little bit beyond his, you know [LIPSMACK] -- what he -- to stretch himself a little bit.
L:  That's fantastic.  I think the reading should be, you know.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I remember I went to a public school.  Um -- um from kindergarten to -- to high school, and I remember like you said, reading the classics.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And um [LIPSMACK] I don't think there's anything wrong with those [NOISE] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if there [NOISE] was I don't remember being [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- being bad in them.  Um, you know, Shakespeare and --
R:  Sha- --
L:  -- all that.  And I think [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that that shouldn't uh -- I don't think that should be censored.
R:  Yeah.  Well, he wanted to read um -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- he wanted to see the movie Lord of the Rings when it was coming out a --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- couple of years ago --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I said, "Fine, [NOISE] but you have to read at least the first book before we go to the movie 'cause I'm [NOISE] not going to sit there --"
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  "-- for two hours answering, 'Who are they?  Where are they going?  Are they good guys or bad guys?"
L:  Right.
R:  "What -- what's that?  Who's that?  Why are they doing this?"  [NOISE] I said to him, "I'm just not going to put up with, you know --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- [NOISE] two hours of it and ..." [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  "You want us to go, you got to read the book --"
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  "-- to get a basic understanding of it" and he was fine with it.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] You know, so if it gets ...
L:  I think um --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- +gender -- gen- -- 
R:  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  -- gender has an -- a little bit to do with it too 'cause boys will read different things than girls.
R:  Oh yeah.  [NOISE] Yeah --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- absolutely.  I mean, I was um -- [NOISE] you know I didn't even [MN] suggest Little House on the Prairie --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or any of those because I'd think, "Oh, girls' books" --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know.  Um, [NOISE] but he discovered Tom Swift and -- and The Hardy Boys and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] Um ...
L:  Right.
R:  So --
L:  Yeah.  Um, I'm reading to my four year old daughter, Anne of Green Gables.
R:  Uh-huh.  Never read that but I know it's one of the good ones.
L:  Yeah, and -- and uh -- I have one of each um --
R:  [NOISE] Okay.
L:  -- but they're [NOISE] -- like I said they're -- my oldest is starting pre-K next [LAUGH] this fall so [SIGH] --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- I don't really -- as far as the school -- I just can -- can on -- on --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what I remember.
R:  [NOISE] Sure.
L:  I don't have any personal experiences with it yet with my children but --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I will soon [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, before you know it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the -- the -- [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the time goes so fast.  Uh, it's just amazing.  He's going to be in seventh grade this fall.
L:  [NOISE] Oh wow. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I think I -- oh, I hear a little one in the background.
L:  Yes.  Yes, he's ten months old.
R:  Oh my goodness.  Is he, uh -- is he pulling himself up and [NOISE] --
L:  Oh yes.  He's walking and -- or not walking but --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- cruising and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and playing.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  He just woke up from his nap.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  His morning -- afternoon nap.
R:  Where are you?
L:  Ah, Oklahoma.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] You have somebody ah deployed? [SIGH] 
L:  Yes I do.  My husband is a Marine.  He is in Okinawa, Japan.
R:  Oh well --
L:  Yeah, so he's -- 
R:  Not quite where the action is.  You must --
L:  No.
R:  -- that must make you feel a little better about having him away.
L:  It -- it was and he happened to be deployed --
