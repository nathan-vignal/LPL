L:  My name is Cindy and I'm from ah Missouri.
R:  Hi, I'm Hayley from Texas.
L:  Okay, Hayley.  Um, topic of the day is censorship.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Wanting to know if the schools have the right, was I understanding, I had a little hard -- trouble understanding what she was saying, but I believe it said, "Have the right to censorship what was read and not read by the students?".
R:  Yeah.  Certain books not to be read.
L:  Okay.  Um, well, I think if the parents won't do it, the school should do it, but I think the parents should be the ones and I think they should send a list home and -- and okay it with the parents --
R:  Have an approved reading list, yeah.  I agree.  I mean, I don't think it should just be open, um, I mean there's definitely -- you want to put limits to, you know, what they are able to ah get to read, but --
L:  But the parents should be the one, I would think that should say what they --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- want their children to read or to not read.
R:  Yeah.  And part of it, I mean e- definitely the school should come up with a list because you would think the educators would, you know, be able to come up with great recommendations and then have the parents review it so that they're able to actually be the final decision maker on what their children are being influenced by.
L:  Exactly.  I agree.
R:  I would think.
L:  I don't ah -- so, I'm not -- I'm not entirely ruling out, you know, the school censorship --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, because I mean let's face it, we know that some parents just don't, you know, they don't care --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- what their --
R:  -- and they don't take the time to --
L:  Right.
R:  -- go ahead and --
L:  And some wouldn't even look at the list if it was sent home.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I think that the parents should have the first right to censorship --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- not the schools.
R:  Definitely.  Yeah.  I think sometimes stuff's taken out of the parents' hands too much when they are their children to raise and they should, you know, definitely have a big say in how that comes about, even when it isn't a school situation where they are more out of your hands.
L:  I agree.  Even though, you know, the schools are ran by the -- by the tax money -- and I understand that too, and I understand that they -- the government has a say so because of that, because it is funded --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but um still, we're talking about children.
R:  Yes.  Definitely, it's --
L:  Like --
R:  -- yeah, there definitely should be censorship, but I -- I agree it should go back to the parents and then the school as well.
L:  Right.
R:  After that.
L:  What the parents won't pick up and the n- the -- obviously somebody's got to --
R:  Step in, yeah.
L:  Um, because the kids, I mean, that's -- that's why they're children, because they need instruction.
R:  Definitely.  Yeah.
L:  So, and I -- my children are raised [LAUGH] so --
R:  H- how old are your children?
L:  Um, twenty nine and twenty three, so --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah.  So --
R:  I have a --
L:  -- but I --
R:  -- three year old and a one year old, so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- we're coming into that soon --
L:  Ooh.
R:  Finding out about how the school system's going to work with them.
L:  Yeah -- w- --
R:  I definitely want to have some say in that [LAUGH].
L:  I think you should.  Yes, now, mine have been out of it so long, you know, and it changes so fast --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and then again too, State by State --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- um, but I do have a four year old granddaughter --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I'm, you know, quite concerned, she's in a large city and -- and, you know, I'm -- I'm wondering what the school system's going to be like there and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, I'm --
R:  What's your opinion of ah public and private school then?
L:  Um, as far as is it a good thing, or ...?
R:  Ah -- going to one as opposed to the other, I guess.
L:  You know, I -- what you have is you have the home lives of the children --
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- that are coming into the schools, it's not the schools their self.
R:  Yeah, that's -- yeah.
L:  So, you could have a very, um, a person going to a private school that is very able to pay the -- the tuition fee but still have a terrible home life and be bringing stuff in and exposing your children to that, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's, you know, it's six of one, half a dozen of the other, I think it's -- parents just have to institute into their children what they expect out of them --
R:  Yeah, and make sure they're getting the right values and stuff.
L:  Right.
R:  Now, I -- I'm just curious as to people's opinion of that because a lot of um, I'm in a mom's club group and, you know, a lot of the kids are starting to start school, so I hear a lot of different opinions about private as opposed to public school and I haven't really made up my decision yet and I haven't -- I'm not opposed to either one, but um I just think that definitely, you know, the -- it doesn't matter, you need to have well behaved, well structured home life, you know, for your children to benefit from any learning experience --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- because it needs to come down to the parents, no matter what.
L:  I agree.  I think the thing that I would look at for a private or a public is -- is the curriculum.
R:  Mhm.
L:  What that is.  Because, as I said before, whatever the -- the -- the, um, you know, the um [LIPSMACK] ethics, the morals or whatever you want to call them, whatever that is is in the school, it -- it's still going to be peer to peer --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, like I said, you do not know what the other children are -- are exposing your children to regardless of -- you think private means a little bit well bred and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but not necessarily so.
R:  No.  Yeah.  You, yeah, you get that a lot where um sometimes the private kids are not paid, you know, if it's a certain school and their parents have too much money and they're just not paying enough attention to their kids at home --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- you know, in focusing on, you know, other things for their careers and stuff, but that can be the total opposite.  I don't think that, you know, you could have that situation in public and private school both.
L:  Right.  Yeah, but it's --
R:  But the most arguments I hear lately is um they say that in public school, you know, they have to accept everybody whereas in private schools there are situations where there is a troublesome child causing problems, they have the right to kick him out --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- so then they act like, you know, then they're not having to be exposed to that, where in public school they don't have that option, so your kids are going to be exposed to, you know, all --
L:  That is true.  You do have that.
R:  -- sorts of problem kids.
L:  I didn't think about that aspect of it.  But you -- they do have a bit more say so, a bit more tighter rein.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then there's always home schooling, too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, they all have pros and cons.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Every single one of them.  I almost did, you know, home schooling with -- with my -- with mine --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, except I had to work --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They have -- there' s a lot of people here in Texas that do home schooling and it's kind of a --a big thing, but [NOISE] I don't know, and they do have the organizations too where they get together and they do get to have some of the social part of it as well, but um going somewhere everyday to school, I think you get a whole lot more social --
L:  I think you do too --
R:  -- experience.
L:  Also, the structured --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, because it's -- it's going on into the -- the work life when you get out of school, it's the structure that you have to get up, you have to get ready, you have to be on time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you have to go, there are rules to follow.  I -- I think it's wonderful --
R:  Yeah, that's so true --
L:  -- I mean, I'm not opposed to home schooling either, but I think it's -- in today's society there are some places that home schooling would pay off, you know, like in Montana I think there's some schools that -- I have a sister in law and she said that her kids had to go like sixty miles when they were little --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- to go to school.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Now, I'm -- there's probably some places still like that in America, I'm not sure, you know, I don't travel a lot --
R:  Mm.  Yeah.
L:  -- but in that case I can see where home schooling might be a little bit more beneficial --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but in today's society it probably, where you're at, where I'm at, it's so -- so um ah -- there's so much population around --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that, no, I think -- I think regular school would be the -- the best way to go, whether it be, you know, private or public --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- more than home schooling.  But, then again, home schooling, you know, has a lot of nice aspects to it too.
R:  And I think that's hard, too, for a parent to have to take that role on, on top of already the disciplinary person as a parent, then you've got to take a whole different role on as a teacher.  I mean, we do that everyday anyways, but, you know, as structured teaching --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I mean, helping with homework's different than actually, you know, teaching them how to do --
L:  Lessons.  Right.
R:  -- math and stuff and I -- you know, the children distinguishing the difference between, "Okay, now you've got your mom's hat on.  Now you've got your teacher's hat on" --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, might be a little confusing too.
L:  I would think so too.  And I -- I just think it's more beneficial if they can go.  I really do.
R:  Yeah.  I think sometimes as a mom you need that break too.
L:  Well, that's true.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Everybody needs some alone time, you know.
R:  [LAUGH] Yes.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Definitely.
L:  I still get my granddaughter, I get her every week and I -- I meet them halfway between their house and my house and I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I bring her back home and I've been doing it since she was, you know, just a couple of weeks old.  Of course I'm, you know, fifty now, so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but when -- when Sunday afternoon comes and it's time to go meet her, I'm like, "Oh, I am so glad, I am so tired" [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But then when she gets in the car, you know, "Bye momar[?], see you next time", it's like, "Oh, I hate to see her go" 
R:  Yeah.  Oh.
L:  But you have to ha- and the older you get, I think the, you know, you just -- it's not so -- I mean, if you had kids right up to -- to you were fifty, you could still contend with it --
R:  Yeah, but to h- --
L:  -- but when you've been away from it --
R:  Not being used to it and then having to be thrown back into it, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's --
R:  Well, it's nice to get to give them back [LAUGH].
L:  Yes.  It is.  I bet you do the same thing, don't you?
R:  Well, you know, I -- I have family lives in California and then my husband's family lives in Kansas, so we don't even have family real close, so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- we don't get a whole lot of a break, so it would be nice to have grandparents closer and I think it would be good for our kids too because something I'm experiencing right now, I have my three year old in swimming lessons and he doesn't want to get in the pool by himself, he's so used to being with me --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that, you know, he's not used to being away, so it would be, you know, better if we did have somebody closer that we could, you know, get them used to -- it's okay to be away from mom and she will come back, you know?
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  So, I think that is a good thing.  Definitely.
L:  Well, we lived away too, when I -- when my children were young --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we -- in fact, that's why we -- we settled in Missouri because we found a little town with a little school which was what we were looking for at the time when our oldest got school age --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when he was um seven years old, because we had -- we -- we traveled so much with -- with my husband's job that we -- I think like in our first seven years of our marriage we lived in like five different States and I don't --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- I can't even tell you the towns --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so, our oldest one didn't really get to meet his grandparents as -- as well as the second one did
