R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Yeah, is anyone there?
L:  Yes, I'm here.
R:  Hi, so, I actually g- -- uh, could not listen to the question, uh, very correctly.  So, what was it?
L:  The question was, should public or private schools be able to -- to govern what books children read.
R:  Oh, okay.  That's interesting one.  [NOISE] 
L:  Yes.  That's -- th- -- can they --  
R:  Okay, so first of all, let me introduce myself.  My name is Toshar[?].
L:  My name is Georgia Lyn.
R:  And I'm in California.
L:  I'm in Pennsylvania.
R:  Okay.  [LIPSMACK] Uh, nice to talk with you.
L:  Nice talking with you.
R:  Uh, so, uh, so, how to begin?
L:  Well, I think that we have to decide if they can -- if they should be able to ban certain books from the children being able to read them.
R:  Yeah --
L:  And I believe that depends on the child's age.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I believe it should also involve the content in the books.  I think the morals in this country have kind of gone downhill.  And I believe that we should kind of watch just a little bit maybe what our younger children read.  Maybe nothing too violent and maybe nothing --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- too, um, sexy and lurid for these younger children.
R:  Yeah, uh, I agree in -- in -- in -- in the sense that when I read the [inaudible] curriculum and the [inaudible] text books and some of the things that I see in the -- you mean the library when the kids are allowed to access.  There's currently as I see no restriction in terms of the things that kids of any age can access, even -- even in the library as far as I know.  So, in terms of even the books in the school, um, I ha- -- I have four year old so I am not exactly sure what, uh, what kind of curriculum do -- [NOISE] or do they have here.  But as far as I know, uh, each school has a different curriculum and the text -- and then the text books that they have are different depending on different, uh, quality of schools, states, you know, cities and -- and -- and -- and somewhere else as well.  So, but I agree that -- that the -- the morals in this society [several inaudible words] in US has -- historically low as compared with the other continents that I visited so far.  And I think in terms of I'm not sure if there is something that leads from the culture values or something that leads from the actual environment out there or from -- from the other society values.  But it's a combination of all of the factors which leads into this as well.  What do you think?
L:  Well, and I also believe that it depends on the area that you live in.  I live in a very rural area.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Therefore the town closest to me is small.  It has probably a thousand or fifteen hundred people.  It's just a small town and here you've got country, um, farm people, a lot of farm people --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- who are a little more strict with what the children are learning and doing.  Like less tattoos and less things so I believe that a lot depends on the area.  We had here about seven or eight years ago, we had a parent, uh, complain about the, Brian Picolo[?], story --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- because it had s- -- quite a few really bad words.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But you can't protect children from everything.  So, I think that you need to introduce these things to them, but at a right age and I think that it has to be a decision made maybe by parents and teachers and school board, what is acceptable and what isn't to these children.  And what age you can introduce these things to them.  Because you can't keep it all away from them.
R:  Yes.  I mean, th- they will actually find some --
L:  You've got to face it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- yes, they will -- they will find some ways and means to get access to those things.
L:  Yes.  I think so too.  But I do think there should be a little bit of common sense used.  Um, I wouldn't like to see them ban -- ban books.  I would like them to be made available but by age groups.
R:  Yes.  I agree.  So, uh --
L:  You know.
R:  -- as and when they are, uh, more mature and more understanding, and they can really, uh, digest the actual material in a sensible manner.
L:  Yes.  Yes.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I agree.  I mean, I -- I -- I've seen [several inaudible words] and this is more, I mean, this is, uh, a very metropolitan, I mean, I [several inaudible words] San Francisco and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- [inaudible] between Oakland and San Francisco and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'm not sire if you know Oakland, they are year so, it's -- it's very rough and , uh, it has the environment here has a very negative impact on the schools and also on the childrens --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there a lot guns, violence and -- and all the other -- other stuff so, I think it's -- it's also the environment as well and particularly in how they grow up.  And -- and the way they've been bought up as well.  And, uh, discipline, uh, s- somehow I feel that, um, talking to a lot of kids here, um, as compared to the -- talking to kids in Europe and Asia and Australia, uh, since Australian [several inaudible words] I feel the older ch- ch- child is less disciplined here compared to all the ch- -- the child in other country.  Maybe I'm wrong.  Or maybe I have the wrong -- contacted the wrong kids.  But --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- that's my impression.
L:  Well, like I said, I've always lived within fifty miles of where I live now.  I was born within fifty miles of here.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I think probably some of our opinions are different, but basically we agree that schools do have a responsibility --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I think they're beginning to -- I think everything in the country, not only the schools, is beginning to be -- get -- to get lax because they don't want to get in trouble with the law by saying, "Hey, you can't read this book" or "We don't think this book is adequate".  But still you have to have some sort of a -- a setup by the age kids -- I -- I just --
R:  I mean -- I mean -- I mean -- I will -- I will -- I would also like to see the -- the [inaudible] states and the, I mean, um, be a more proactive [several inaudible words] the education department the states take a more stringent approach in terms of banning, uh, [several inaudible words] as -- as -- as age wise in terms of text books.  And be a more -- or more consistent basis to what they can ban and what they cannot ban.
L:  Yeah.  And I think it would be nice -- if there's a book that's a little questionable --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- then it would be nice if the book is read in the class room --
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- where adults and children can discuss it and clear up any maybe misconceptions they have of the book.  You know sometimes they just need a little guidance to say, "Do you think this was done properly or not?  And maybe if they would get in with the teachers, even maybe bring in some parents -- their parents.
R:  Well, yeah.  I -- and -- and -- and -- and most of the -- most of the time, the kids who are -- who are seven or eight or nine or even eleven or twelve, they don't really under- -- know or understand, uh, the reason because they read what you -- what you tell them to read or they will, uh, typically buy what you want to see these buy.  So, if the parents take somewhat more interest as you already mentioned and -- and also along with the sc- school teachers, you -- you can guide them to be able to read something that is more worthwhile for them rather than spend the time in doing -- into the [inaudible] which they should not be reading at their age.
L:  Yes.  I -- I agree.  I -- I would like to see that and I don't think you see this as much any more.  I don't think that most teachers today -- like they used to, like, when I was growing up your teacher could be your best friend.  Today teachers are there to teach and get out and they don't want to take the time to discuss these books with the children.
R:  Yeah.  And -- and -- I -- I -- and -- and -- and -- and not to -- and not to mean dis- disrespect to them, but nowadays what seems to happen the -- it's like the -- [MN] the constant worry at the back of the mind I guess in their heads is about what would happen if they would school somebody or [inaudible] they would just tell somebody not to read something.  So, the -- the fear of law and the fear of [inaudible] the fear of -- of being sued --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- is -- is -- is at the back of their minds, especially, yeah, you -- you get sued for anything, any time.
L:  Oh, yes.  Or we could be sued for talking.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I -- but I do think that there are certain books.  I'm not saying they should take 'em completely out.  Because they'll get 'em someplace else.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, children or boys are going to go out and buy girlie magazines.  And girls are going to go out and buy magazines that maybe aren't good and they'll just hide 'em when they get home.
R:  Yeah.
L:  There isn't the parental supervision there used to be.  Parents work more now, kids are alone more.  They're subjected to the television; they're subjected to the computer.  There actually probably isn't much that most children don't know by the time they're five or six, seven years old that they don't know or haven't seen someplace.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  But I think they should get with adults and discuss these things.  And the books and I think those books --
R:  And -- and -- and maybe in -- in this respect, maybe the, uh, just like the other reading system, maybe the book can also [several inaudible words] the stories too well, this -- th- this book is meant for, uh, for m- -- people between six and eight, or six and nine so -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- maybe -- so if that -- so maybe when -- when the letter on the top of the book read, okay, for age six to eight only or aged [several inaudible words] when somebody buys that, at least when a parent or somebody buys it, they can see the age and at least [inaudible] quickly because otherwise when parents buy it they would -- they would -- they would not even know what this book contains.
L:  No.  Most of 'em would not read --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a book first.
R:  Yeah.
L:  No.
R:  So -- so --
L:  And everything else is graded like that.  You can't buy video games or anything any more that aren't graded.  Records are graded, programs --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- are graded.  So, books should be -- that's a good idea.  Go- -- books should be graded --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- too.
R:  Then -- then [several inaudible words] I mean, if the -- the age, uh, if the [inaudible] if -- if there's a [inaudible] if there's a, um, mandited[?] -- mention of the age on all the books on the top, I mean, it becomes easy for people to buy those books and --
