L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.  My name is Tina.
R:  Yeah, my name is Joe.  How're you doing?
L:  [NOISE] Fine, Joe.  What's up? [NOISE]
R:  Well I --
L:  You're in the Fisher Price call study?
R:  what was this?
L:  You're in the fisher Price call study?
R:  Yeah, uh --
L:  [NOISE] I -- I believe the topic of the day is censorship.
R:  Yeah, I think so, yeah.
L:  And it has to do with students in school?
R:  Well, I'm not sure whether students in school or any type of censorship I guess.
L:  [NOISE] I --
R:  I'm not sure but if -- if -- if it has to do with school, I'd say good enough for me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh --
L:  I don't know if I believe in [MN] --
R:  Censorship?
L:  Some censorship I think to a limit depending on the age.
R:  Well, I don't -- I don't believe in it in school.  I think that kids should be taught what's, um, whatever that they have in their school library or whatever, you know.
L:  [MN]
R:  I -- I believe in maybe certain books should not be there.
L:  Yeah, that -- along that line like something that would be X rated or --
R:  Well, yeah that --
L:  -- R rated for grade school.
R:  Yeah, that stuff I don't believe in.
L:  But I think kids should be learning like the evolution and then the church belief, you know.  I -- I don't think they should censor those.
R:  Well, the other thing that I believe in too that they should be able to say the pledge of allegiance in school too.
L:  Oh, I do too --
R:  That's another thing that they --
L:  -- most certainly.
R:  They abolish that and that to me is --
L:  [NOISE] That's censorship, I think.
R:  Yeah, I -- I just can't believe that they're doing this stuff --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- these kids today.
L:  I think that if they wanted -- if they didn't want to participate you just don't stand up --
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  -- and pledge but give everybody else the opportunity to honor their country.
R:  Right, and as I say, the other thing goes too --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, when we were kids you used to maybe say a little prayer in the morning before you started, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- classes.  They can't even do that today because it's this religion thing.
L:  I know.  I remember growing up and it was just a part of your day to do that, you know [NOISE].  It's almost like you didn't even [NOISE] think about it.
R:  Yeah, well see -- that's the problem today, I mean this whole world has gone cockeyed --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- because of the censorship bit you know.  You can't do, uh -- do anything today unless they, uh, cut you off at the knees, you know.
L:  I know and you know, they think censorship is -- is so many other things than -- what am I trying to say?  Like back then censorship had nothing to do with not being able to do the pledge of allegiance and saying prayers in the school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  These days censorship is not -- you know what I'm -- 
R:  Well, I --
L:  I'm at a loss of words for how I'm trying to --
R:  Well, to get away from the -- the school bit and everything, I mean, censorship in the government, everything else.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, like, uh, they're trying to censor everything now as far as, uh, what, uh, they're trying to do as far as what these, uh, uh, Taliban and all these people, you know, that started this nine eleven bit.
L:  Taliban.  What you -- you mean the --
R:  Yeah, Afghanistan, you know, and the --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- the whole bit and Iraq and the whole -- everything.  You know, they're trying to censor what he's trying to do, the Attorney General --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and make sure that these guys don't get away scot free so as soon as he comes with some new law or something, right away it's -- they don't want no part of it.
L:  I'm trying to follow you.  I'm not sure what -- I'm not sure if I'm following you on that.
R:  Well, that's -- to me, that's uh, trying to be -- be -- censorship trying to stop him from bringing new laws himself.
L:  Oh, oh, yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  Some of the laws we have on the books are so old now that they don't even [LAUGH] -- these not even a reason for them --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and yet we're not allowed to create new ones to -- to adapt our changing society as it is today.
R:  Well, yeah, that's -- to me, that's censorship too because [LAUGH] they won't let you do anything in this country anymore.
L:  They let you do all the wrong things [LAUGH].
R:  Well, that's -- that's what happening in the country.
L:  You're allowed to do all kinds of things that aren't so good for ya but --
R:  Yeah.  Well, anyway back to schools and everything else, just schools are not what they used to be anymore today, you know.
L:  You know, I've been out of school for twenty years and I know -- my son is two years old and I'm -- I'm trying to imagine what it's gonna be like when he gets into school in another five years or so.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And the gap I could -- when it was when I went to school and what it is now.  I remember books in school that were banned were books like --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- one was Go Ask Alice.  It was a diary of a drug addict --
R:  Oh,
L:  -- and, um, we used to sneak into the library to read that book.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  To the public library because we weren't -- we weren't allowed to have that book at all.  It was censored and, you know, that book was the most -- I learned so much from that book about what I didn't want to do when I grew up --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just by reading the horrible experiences this girl named Alice had than I would of if I just hadn't been able to read the book.
R:  Yeah.
L:  There -- there are some things I think they go a little too far in in protecting children --
R:  Well --
L:  -- and what they're not doing -- they're not protecting the child, they're actually prohibiting the child from learning what could happen, you know.  It's almost like a -- a temptation then.
R:  Well, they -- they -- I -- I don't think they're teaching in the schools today like they used to teach, okay.  Uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- as far as the kids themselves and, uh, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- well if you go back and even, uh -- I don't know if you ever had the Lady Chatterley's Lover in the -- in the library as a book in school.
L:  I remember that book.
R:  Yeah, and, uh --
L:  I wasn't allowed to read that one either [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And they had I think in the library, right.  They tried to ban that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they -- I think they finally did after a while but then after a couple of years or so, I guess it got back in somehow or maybe it's still banned today.  I don't know.
L:  I can't even remember what that book was about.  I just remember that it was so good to be able to read it because I wasn't allowed to read it [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, well, that's [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's what happens.  We're not supposed to do something and we do it right [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  You try and get away with it.  Even then we -- used to do that and the kids today are even worse.
L:  I -- oh, I --
R:  They do it right out in the open.
L:  I know.  There's --
R:  So, uh --
L:  I think parents are too afraid to -- to --
R:  Well, parents today don't, uh, discipline their kids.
L:  Yeah.  They're afraid to do anything because --
R:  Well, they're afraid to --
L:  -- it could come right back at them as -- as corporal punishment.
R:  You know --
L:  If you spank a kid on the butt, it's --
R:  But they're afraid of kids today.
L:  I know it.
R:  You know, as a parent, they're afraid of their own kids.
L:  They let them get away with too much and let the kids have too much power then the kids grow up and they have absolutely no concept of having to pay for something they did.
R:  Yeah, well the problem is they're going to [inaudible] right away [LAUGH].
L:  Huh?
R:  They run to [inaudible] right away and turn you in.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  So, but anyway I -- I just don't believe that, uh, they let these kids do what we use to do in school.  I mean, the prayers and the pledge of allegiance and all that and -- and, uh, if you don't want to read a -- if you want to read a certain book, you can't do it today and then they tell you what you can read and what you can't read in schools today, you know.
L:  You know, I -- I can see like X rated magazines, things like that, pornography being censored from a school but as far as just real reading material, novels, so long as it's not X rated.  X rated I -- I do think should be censored from schools but even --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- up to R rated, I mean a kid is gonna get a hold of something one way or another.  If the library just lets the kids have access to the books --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and read, I think if they're more informed about things that could happen, things that have happened to people, horrible things or lifestyles they're less tempted --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to get into those kind of things than they would be if they had no idea what they were about. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  They would grow up and then -- and then try it because they didn't know anything about it.  
R:  Oh, that's true too.  That's the same thing with R rated movies.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, where the kids can get in, they'll go --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, uh, like they say, they monitor them at the box office but I doubt that.  I see kids going to see movies that they shouldn't really be seeing.
L:  Oh, yeah, I've seen that too.
R:  So, when, uh -- that's should be censored right there.  I think some of them movies should be censored for these kids that young and you see --
L:  No, they --
R:  -- parents taking these young kids in with them anyway.
L:  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  They --
R:  You know.
L:  If the parents don't take the responsibility, the parents should really be the ones that decide whether their child is older enough or ready -- mature enough to read or see certain things, just as they would on the Internet.  They should be monitoring them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I have a feeling that a lot of parents don't -- they just leave it up to the schools and the schools, like, on their part want to censor things because they're afraid of the actions the parents will take if they don't like it.
R:  Well, that's right.
L:  It goes back to the parents.  I think the parents really should take a -- the big lion's share of monitoring what their child is reading and you know, instead of having access to the books, not having them censored but having the parents tell the child, "No, --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- I would prefer that you wait until you are older to read that".
R:  Well, I think that's a lot of the problems in the school today.  The teachers are afraid of the kids.
L:  Well, yeah.
R:  And they're afraid to let them have anything that, uh, they shouldn't really have.
L:  You read about this all the time.  Kids are hitting, they're shooting, they're cutting, they're pulling weapons out of their pockets.
R:  Well, that's -- that's the problem with the schools today.  Teachers are so scared that they -- they're afraid of even doing anything with, you know --
L:  Between that and --
R:  -- in the schools today --
L:  -- lawsuits.
R:  -- with their kids because of the problems that they cause and they go to school today, these kids and they wear earphones and they don't take them off.  The teacher has to take them off of them.
L:  Isn't that horrible?
R:  And, uh --
L:  You know, that they don't even have enough respect for an adult that they -- they don't have any fear and -- but that all goes back to the parents.  The parents are the ones that are influencing the child mainly and they -- they're not instilling that in the child.
R:  Oh, that's [LAUGH] -- you've got it right there on the head.  You hit the nail on the head because it's the parents ...
