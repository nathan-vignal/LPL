L:  Hi, I'm Nicholas Martin.
R:  Hi.  Hi, I'm Jackie.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  Um, so, yeah.
R:  Well, let it -- do you have kids?
L:  Uh, no.  I'm a student actually.
R:  Yeah.  I have one that's twelve and she's in a private school.  [SIGH], uh, you know, I -- I don't really know how I feel about [LAUGH] that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, ye- -- I think it has to be age appropriate as far as what they read, what -- what children read.  Um, but no I'm -- I'm not really for -- for censorship.
L:  Um, yes.  Uh, I went to -- actually to -- went to a -- a public school.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I think that, um, as far as censorship goes, I don't think that they should, like, not allow the students to read it.  But maybe they don't have to, like, provide them with the books.  Like, maybe they don't have to have them in their school, like, available to the students.  Like, if they bring it from outside, like, the library or whatever, then that would be okay.  I don't think they should, like, stop someone 'cause maybe they're -- there's a student that's, like, at a higher reading level than the other students.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  If they have a higher maturity level, then I think they should be allowed to read it.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I'm just applying that m- -- to myself- -- you know, thinking back when I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- was in school.  And I was in a public school too.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  And, uh, you know, my daughter is in a Christian school and they're very strict.  But, um, uh, too strict I think.  But for her dad it's, like, really important for her to be there, otherwise she would be in a public school.  And they -- they just -- they just allow a lot of -- of books, um, like they don't allow Harry Potter books or anything like that there at -- in the school library.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And -- oh yeah.  Anything that has to do with --
L:  Hm.  Well, yeah.  Christian school.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, yeah.    
R:  Uh --
L:  That makes sense.
R:  -- anything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, but my daughter -- I allow her to read whatever she wants basically.  Um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- she's a very advanced reader --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, like age a- -- age appropriate I -- I don't want her reading the Hustler.  [LAUGH] or -- 
L:  Of course.  Of course.
R:  Y- you know what I'm saying?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  As far as books, I can't really think of any that I wouldn't allow her to read if -- as long as she understood it and could process it.
L:  Um, I agree, yeah.  And I think, like, it kinda draws a line, like, public -- I mean private schools because there are the religious based private schools --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I think that, like, they're more [inaudible] like, shouldn't be compromised and I don't think they should, like necessarily compromise that just so they allow all kinds of books.  But I -- I -- I don't think, like, they should stop a student from reading it.  [PAUSE] [MN]
R:  [NOISE] I'm sorry, my daughter is home --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- from school [LAUGH] --
L:  Okay.  Yeah.
R:  -- interrupting here.  She didn't know I was on the phone.  Yeah, I'm tr- -- well, like, my -- when -- I'm just trying to think as far as -- I -- I think it kinda all goes back to the parents to, um, I'm -- I'm pretty much a liberal type of woman [LAUGH] --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and my daughter does a lot of -- a lot of things that other parents don't -- [MN] will allow their kids to do.  But --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- she's -- she's more mature and if -- if she [NOISE] [MN] like -- like, we just, like, I just said, and I think you con- concurred, um, [LIPSMACK] it depends on the maturity level.
L:  Uh, yeah.  I agree.
R:  It depends on --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [MN], you know she knows that [PAUSE] not to act out what she actually --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- sees, knowing that it, you know, something you can read [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.  I think, yeah, like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- my parents were very liberal and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- like, they, like, encouraged reading, like, even, like, higher books --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that were at -- at the same level as the other students and may -- may not been appropriate 'cause they was, like, language and things in the books that were not, like, s- so appropriate for, like, middle school or, like, elementary school students.  But --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- like, they still encouraged me reading.  And I think it helped me overall because it, like, I wanted to read the books and then it increased my reading level.  So, I -- I don't think that, like --
R:  [MN]  
L:  -- taking away those --
R:  -- like, for example, can you think of anything?  I'm curious now.
L:  Um, like, I don't know.  The one [LAUGH] what is the one they banned?  I forgot [LAUGH].  It's been so long.
R:  [LAUGH] It's been -- 
L:  -- there -- there was a book that was --
R:  You sound so young too.
L:  Yeah.  There was a book that was banned, like, [PAUSE] [SIGH] I don't remember.  'Cause I read it again -- I read it in, like, sixth grade and then I read it again, like, eleventh grade or twelfth grade.  Um, but, yeah.  I forgot the one.
R:  Well, it, like, I -- I -- my -- my daughter, um, like, I -- I have American Psycho I don't know if you've -- you've ever read that or -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- saw the move or anything and --
L:  Saw the movie.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- pardon?  
L:  Saw the movie.
R:  Yeah.  [MN] I don't like -- I would prefer that she not read that right now but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, you know, if she went to pick it up and started to read it, it's on the bookshelf.  I -- I don't know.  I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And the schools -- 
L:  Hm.
R:  Huh.
L:  Yeah.  And I think -- I don't know, like, the public and private issue.  I think public schools since they are, like, funded from the government --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- like, I think they should be a little less lenient on, like, what they decide that the students can't do.
R:  A little less lenient?
L:  Less lenient, yeah.  Because, like, if there's -- the parents are paying for the private school, then I think that if they don't think that the students should be reading or, like, they shouldn't read, like, Harry Potter say, and, like, they don't think that's appropriate, then I think the school has the right to say that the students can't read that.  
R:  Uh, well, yeah.  You s- -- you s- -- basically sign an -- it -- you sign an agreement before --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they even go to school.  But [MN] now I thought I w- -- understood you to say that the public schools should be more strict.
L:  No.  More lenient.
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  
L:  Yes.
R:  I misunderstood.
L:  Sorry.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  No.  I -- I agree with that.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Um, I don't li- -- you know, I want to read what I want to read.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, and I think too, when you forbid somebody, it's like the forbidden fruit.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They makes them [MN] all that more anxious to want to read it.  Oh, what is it my parents don't want me to read?  Or what is it he school thinks is so bad?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  [LAUGH] But I -- I mean that's just human nature --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [MN] basically.
L:  And I think, like, as far as, like, the Harry Potter books go [LAUGH] -- sorry I had to go back to that --
R:  Yeah.   Please do.
L:  -- um, like, I know one of my friend's friends was, uh, like, she's in middle school --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- well she was in middle school.  It was, like, when the first one came out.  Um, but they didn't al- -- like, w- -- allow her to read it.  But then she read it, like, someone else's copy.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And she was, like, "What -- what was the big deal because it wasn't that bad, and I think the Harry Potter books are really good".  And she's, like, um, really strong in her Christian faith--
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, like, the book didn't affect her.  It didn't, like, change anything.  And it -- she'd said it was good reading and she, like, collects the books now.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, let's see, they came out about four years ago and my daughter --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is going into eighth.  So, she was, like, in the fourth grade and she --
L:  Yeah,
R:  -- sh- -- we got the books.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  She read 'em --
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  -- um, and -- and has read them [MN] so many times and she's on the -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- she's read the other one and she read them to me and I, uh, I don't see anything wrong with them.  I can't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- really understand what the people are so up in arms about.  There's a lot, uh, worse things going on than --
L:  True.  Yeah.
R:  -- [MN] uh, fi- -- uh, book of fiction.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I think what people think, uh, like, the underlying tones that could be said about the book, which I don't think that children necessarily pick up on.  [LAUGH] Like witchcraft and stuff like that.  I don't know.
R:  Yeah.  Um, I don't know.  See my thoughts are if [MN] she wants [NOISE] to be --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- a witch when she's an adult or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- however you would phrase it --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- [MN] [SIGH] as long as she's happy and then she's thought it through, then I'd support her in -- in what she wants to do.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  But, you know, who knows.  [PAUSE] [NOISE]  
L:  Hm.  [NOISE] 
R:  I th- -- I want to talk about other things.   [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  Yeah, me too.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  [NOISE] [PAUSE] Huh.
L:  And I think, um, like, a lot of the books -- I think, like, a lot of the movies that come from books are, like, say rated R and, like, some of the books would be rated R as if they were a movie.  And I think that reading the book is a little less, like, I don't know, like, not violent but, like, less detrimental I guess.   [several inaudible words] 
R:  The -- reading the book?
L:  Yeah.  I think it's better if they read the book say to, like, a movie that would be rated R than, like, actually see the movie.  Because the books are usually less, um, less harsh.  I don't know.
R:  Well, you don't actually see it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think.  I mean, you can visualize it in --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- in your imagi- -- your imagination only will take it as far as you feel comfortable with.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Probably.  I -- I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- mean, I don't know.  I can only speak for myself.  But when you actually see it acted, you know, acted out on screen --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- then that can be kinda shocking I guess.
L:  'Cause it takes it further than you actually ever thought, like, imagined.
R:  Yes.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they do go -- it does go further --
L:  Yeah.  Exactly. 
R:  -- and further.   Yeah, and the movies that they make and --
L:  But I, yeah, like, I think books --
