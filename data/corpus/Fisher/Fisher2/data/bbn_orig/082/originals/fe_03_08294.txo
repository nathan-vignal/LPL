R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] Are you there?
R:  Yeah, hi.
L:  Hi, it -- I didn't get a beep, did you?
R:  No, I didn't really get one.
L:  Oh, okay, my name is --
R:  So --
L:  -- Tracy, by the way. [SIGH] 
R:  Okay, I'm Heidi.
L:  Hi, Heidi.
R:  Hi, nice to meet ya.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Nice to meet --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you too.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  So, I guess our question today is --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- do schools, whether they're per- private or --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- public have the right to require students --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- to read certain books.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Is that the way you got it? [LAUGH] 
L:  Yes, that is exactly --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- what I got. [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay, just --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- wanted to make sure.  Sometimes I don't --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- hear those questions very well.  Um --
L:  Oh, oh, have you done more than one call?
R:  [NOISE] Um, I've done it before, yeah.
L:  Oh, this my first --
R:  So --
L:  -- one. [LAUGH] 
R:  It's not hard, you just keep talking, they'll tell you when to [NOISE] hang up. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, ok-
R:  So, I don't know, what do you think?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, [SIGH] in some ways I can understand it, you know, that [MN] some parents feel the need to censor what their children are reading, [SIGH] especially in a school setting because --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you don't know what any particular child has been through, [SIGH] you -- you know what I mean?  Um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like, say a child, god forbid, has been raped or something, and a -- [SIGH] you're reading a book that contains something like that, you could [MN] mess with a child that, you know, is still in the process of getting the help they need. [SIGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  So -- but as for the school censoring it, I don't know.  What do you think?
R:  Well, okay.  Do I think that the school has the right to say yes or no to, uh, certain things, subjects?  Well, y- yeah, to a certain extent.  I mean, you know, they have to cert- set certain guidelines, like, you know, [MN] [NOISE] can't think of an example, of course, right now. [NOISE] I just got up not so long ago. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, [SIGH] you know, they -- I don't think [NOISE] -- I think they need to set certain overall guidelines, like, these are [inaudible] like the type of thing, [NOISE] you know, it needs to be considered a classic of certain -- such and such, you know, that type of thing.
L:  Right.
R:  But I say that, like, they should -- like, [MN] to say that, like, a book shouldn't be read, period, for the school, or it shouldn't be available in the library --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- you know, I don't think so, you know, I don't know. 
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  That's a really hard question for me, I guess. [LAUGH] 
L:  I know.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  No, like, who would you -- who would you want, if you supported that, [SIGH] who would you want making that decision, or, like, would you want the people that work at the school [SIGH] you know, deciding what books can or can't be -- or would you want, like, a [SIGH] panel of parents?
R:  [NOISE]  
L:  See, that's the hard part.
R:  [NOISE] See, yeah, and I think, [NOISE] because it always gets back to the same people and it's like they're [NOISE] -- you know, do I think they should be reading, like, n- Mein Kampf in high school?  No, I really don't think that a lot of high school teacher are able to, like [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] understand that.  
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  So, should that be banned in high school?  Probably, because it's -- a lot of kids don't have the maturity level to handle or to understand that and [SIGH] [LAUGH] --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Right.
R:  -- understand what's going on.
L:  Yeah, you're not kidding.
R:  And maybe that's and example of, like, something that maybe should be -- but, you know, I guess, maybe, if it was, like, done like that, I guess an ideal setting would be -- well, you would have to draw -- I know it doesn't work, okay? [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You'd do this, okay, [SIGH] but in a Heidi world [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] A Heidi w-
R:  -- you know, maybe -- [LAUGH] yeah [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- draw from, um, [NOISE] like, the student would have a say in it, a percentage of the teachers would have a say in it, you know, the family members would have a say in it.
L:  Right, but then you have to decide -- and, see, to me this is what really blows everything out of the water. [SIGH] 
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] What are you --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- going to censor? Are you going to censor --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- all books that have --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- sexual content in them --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] or just some of them?  Are you going to, [MN] you know, censor books that [SIGH] might have r- you know, racial problems in them?  What are you going to censor and, you know ?
R:  Yeah, where do you stop?
L:  Exactly.
R:  That's the other problem. [SIGH] You know, because, I mean, you know, is it stupid for, like, Animal Farm to be, like, um [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- cen -- a censored book?  Yeah, that's dumb, I think, you know? [SIGH] Um, that's, [SIGH] you know -- so, I mean, you know, I don't know, you know, I just don't know that say- [SIGH] I guess what I see, like, maybe a need for it, I just don't know how to make it work, you know, there are times --
L:  Right.
R:  -- y- you know, 'cause I think that's there's something that -- you know, you can find anybody that's g- not going to like something. [LAUGH] 
L:  No, exactly.
R:  You know?
L:  [SIGH] I -- I remember when I was in high school that there was a big to do over the Judy B- Blume book, [SIGH] um, [LIPSMACK] Forever.  Have you --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- ever read that?
R:  Mm, if I did, I don't remember it.
L:  Yeah, [MN] well, it was a bout a girl falling in love for the first time and, [SIGH] you know, having sex with her -- her boyfriend and [SIGH] the whole basis of the book was Judy Blume's daughter, at one point in her life, had asked her mom to [MN] please write a book about two teenagers who fall in love, [SIGH] have sex and nothing bad ever happens.  You know, no teenage pregnancy, and so that -- she did, and that's the book that she wrote, [SIGH] and there was a big to do in my school about it because [SIGH] you know, it talked about masturbation, it talked about birth control and the girl getting it --
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] yeah.
L:  -- and their whole --
R:  All those things. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- sexual relationship. [SIGH] But to me the way she wrote that book was -- it was so well written that now I, as a parent, [SIGH] if my son or daughter didn't feel comfortable talking to me about stuff like that, [SIGH] thank god there's a book, you know, out there like that that doesn't preach that sexuality is good, bad, indifferent or whatever, it just -- it just is, it's just a part of the book. [SIGH] And, see -- and I like that because, you know, there's people out there that are -- you know, might not want to ask questions on any kind of topic and [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if you censor the book, especially with kids, [SIGH] you know, if you censor the book, where are they going to get their information?  From their friends?  God forbid, you -- [LAUGH] you know --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- how teenagers are. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, yeah, the information they're likely to have, uh -- um, I don't know.  See, in a way, you know, I think that overall censorship doesn't work, period. [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't either.
R:  Or it can maybe feel, like, you know, like, well -- but, you know, it -- it just doesn't work, I don't think, you know, in the long run, 'cause, like, you know, if you tell somebody they don't want it -- I mean, that they can't read it or can't do it, that -- I mean, it just makes them want to do it more. [LAUGH] You know.
L:  Right, and then it's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the whole thing of --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you can't please all the people all the time.
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH] So, there's always going to be somebody mad about the certain books that were or weren't banned, [SIGH] somebody else is happy, and then you're going to have the fights, and [SIGH] it's more trouble than it's worth. [NOISE] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] I think it should be --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- a personal --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- decision, as far as kids are concerned.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] That it should be a --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- parental choice. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- but then, you know, you have some -- I mean, we should just be done with that [inaudible]. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean, you have, like, some parents that just don't care what their kids do, you know, I mean, what about those kids, you know? [SIGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  You know, they don't get any guidance, their parents don't want to know what they read, don't care what they read, don't [LAUGH] --
L:  I know, I know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- problems of the scary parents. [NOISE] 
R:  You know, I think --  I think that's what church[?] -- 'cause I -- well, [SIGH] I don't know.
L:  No, it's a really -- it -- that's a -- that's a really difficult topic.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, well, at least it's something to talk about, let me tell you. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  [NOISE] I can't [SIGH] --
L:  [LIPSMACK] You know.  Are you in Wisconsin? [SIGH] 
R:  No, I live in a -- Indiana.
L:  Oh, do you?  Oh, okay.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Why, where are you from?
L:  I'm in Florida, I originally grew up in Ohio.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  Your accent sounded like Wisconsin.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, well, how did you end up in Florida? [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] well, we moved down here -- I'm thirty now -- we moved down here when I was fifteen, fourteen, fifteen. [SIGH] My dad --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- got transferred, so 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, been here ever since. [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah, I used to live up in Minnesota.
L:  Oh, did you?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, that's beautiful up there.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  And that is the one thing I miss, is the snow.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I don't miss that winter stuff, you know, because I grew up -- well, I guess, I spent, like, my elementary years up there.
L:  Right.
R:  So, nothing comes up [NOISE] [inaudible]. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] So, how long --
R:  But --
L:  -- have you been doing the surveys for?
R:  You know, I did, like, a round of 'em a few months ago, and then, like, I hadn't heard from 'em and I just went back to the site, and re- like, did stuff and, like, they called again, so, that -- you know, it was, um -- I know it was cold out, it -- when I did it, probably, like, January, February, when I did some for 'em before -- no, maybe March, I don't know, and so I just -- it's easy.
L:  Yeah, yeah. [LAUGH] [NOISE] [LAUGH] Can't complain about the money. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, you know, I mean, sit here t-
