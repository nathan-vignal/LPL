R:  Hi --
L:  Hi, my --
R:  -- my name is Gina. [SIGH] 
L:  Hi, my name is [inaudible], how are you?
R:  I'm good, how are you?
L:  Okay.  What was the topic again? [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] 
L:  [MN] 
R:  I think they were saying it was um, "What do you think of schools, ah, [MN] making kids read certain books a- "
L:  Oh.  [LIPSMACK] Uh, like -- like censorship or [NOISE] something like that?
R:  Ah, yeah --
L:  W- I -- I think I heard [NOISE] --
R:  -- yeah.  I think so. Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, okay.  Um.  Hm [LAUGH] well, I guess it depends, ah -- ah, it depends wh- what kind of books they are. [NOISE] 
R:  Right.  Exactly.  Well, I --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- don't have kids [NOISE] so I really can't [LAUGH] say, but ah --
L:  Well, yeah.  And I -- I'm actually, like, I teach w- autistic children [NOISE] from two to five so I really [NOISE] -- we read just anything to them but, really, they really wouldn't understand anyways. [LAUGH] [SIGH] Um.  [NOISE] Well, I feel that they should get a lot of um -- depending on their age, they -- they should get, like [LIPSMACK] a lot of phonics kind of books [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] 
L:  What do you think? [LAUGH] 
R:  Um [MN] I don't know --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- well, I guess it would depend on wh- --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- what age group it is and what type of books they're --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- talking about.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I mean [NOISE] like --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I'm -- I'm thirty three so --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- like, you know, back when they had, I don't know, like, George Orwell books out.  You know, like Nineteen Eighty Four, like that seemed like it was a big deal [NOISE] or something. [SIGH] 
L:  Okay [NOISE] --
R:  Um.
L:  -- like, ah, basically um, on um -- um my age -- I -- I used to read like a Doc- -- a lotta Doctor Seuss's books and um -- and I -- reading Rainbow kinda books too [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] W- how old are you?
L:  I'm twenty two. [NOISE] 
R:  Okay. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  So you're really a lot --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- younger than me. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Yeah, so, um.  Well, basically, yeah I -- I feel that [MN] it's [NOISE] entertaining, like rhyme books.  [NOISE] You know, i- it's something that'll -- I -- I think right now [NOISE] kids uh should read uh books that all sound entertaining to them like, ah -- ah [MN] like, kinda books that rhyme like The Cat In The Hat or the Green Eggs And Ham.  You know.  Uh, Sam I Am.  You know -- th- those kinda things?  I- it's more likely for them to remember and they find it cute because it's like [MN] it rhymes and -- and -- and, you know.  And they're easy words too and [MN] it's, you know, it's something easy to memorize --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- and it makes it entertaining [NOISE] and fun for them at the same time.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH] 
L:  Uh, yeah.
R:  Oh, I don't know.  Kids are so advanced these days in school with learning about so much stuff that --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, I ne- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I [NOISE] never learned about, yeah.  Like they have sex --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- education an- all that kinda stuff now and give out condoms and, like, [SIGH] you know, when I went to school they never would do that and, um [SIGH] -- 
L:  Oh, yeah -- yeah.  A lotta kids are -- these days, they know [NOISE] [MN] more than they should but it's, like, you know, I think they should use their knowledge that they're, like, more on reading books 'cause these days a lot of them don't want to read books any more.  [NOISE] I mean it's like they just want to watch TV and you know.  [NOISE] I think they should, um, take more time -- I've always liked to read books [NOISE] so it depends what kinda program they put in school that'll make it entertaining and fun.  Like, I remember back in nineteen eighty two I think it was, they had that RIF Program -- Reading is Fundamental --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and um, it -- [MN] -- they used to make a lotta commercials about that, like, um, [LIPSMACK] how they would promote a lot of that in schools, communities [NOISE] ah, about um [NOISE] -- about having, you know -- integrating your kids, making them read, uh, any kind of books [NOISE] or whatever and I [NOISE] always used to go t- the library and get, like -- check out ten books a [NOISE] month and everything and, you know?  Easy books.  I -- I us- usually like [NOISE] books with pictures.  They show us, [NOISE] like, books like, with [NOISE] pictures.  [NOISE] Make it more visual for them.  And then as they [NOISE] you know, like, [NOISE] learn to like words better, like to read and you know, doesn't have to be with [NOISE] pictures any more --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- so that's how, you know, I got to like to read novels and this [NOISE] and that. [NOISE] 
R:  Mm.
L:  But these days kids [NOISE] they really, [NOISE] you know, you have to have a good um, [NOISE] really focused uh, program for them to [NOISE] like what, you know, like reading.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Right. [SIGH] I know --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- a lotta kids are really bad in school now and it's so -- like, you wonder if they even pay attention or care to begin with, 'cause um, [SIGH] one of my friends was a um English teacher --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- for high school for a while and um, yeah, he had like a two year contract and he [LAUGH] -- he went on to, like, do sales just because, like, the kids that he taught were so bad and, you know, they'd use foul language and obscenities to him and um he'd go and tell the parents and they'd be, like, "Oh no, my kid would never do that" --
L:  Hah.
R:  -- yeah, and -- and so they would get out of that and, um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] y- know a- and -- and these are kids from, like, good [NOISE] families too.  I dunno if they're more spoiled that way [LAUGH] but um [SIGH] I think it's more a reflection on the parents 'cause they --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- don't care and so [MN] -- we're talking about censorship.  I don't even think a lot of [MN] your parents pay attention to what their kids are doing [SIGH] so they might not --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- even care what they're reading or know what's going on.  Honestly. [LAUGH] 
L:  Exactly.  Yeah.  These days they're -- er, you know, [NOISE] it's like, these days [NOISE] they don't even know [NOISE] where the [NOISE] kids are at certain times.  It's like, you know, I -- I see ah, [NOISE] my neighbors and sometimes their kid is just running -- roaming around the street, you know.  Yeah, like, I live in New York City and um i- i- it could be wild around my neighborhood sometimes and it's like the kids [NOISE] as [MN] young -- young as nine years old and it's like, the parents [NOISE] sometimes don't know where they are --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- like, let alone [NOISE] what they're doing or what [NOISE] they're reading or whatever. [LAUGH] So, yeah, I understand.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, [NOISE] yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I know, I live in Virginia Beach but the kids around here are like [SIGH] you know, I -- I don't want to say a lot of them are stupid but, yeah, they do, they just kinda hang out --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and you know, they're sorta --
L:  They don't have m- much knowledge and that's what -- you know, you really can't blame them.  It's just the way uh the [NOISE] system is nowadays, you know?  They don't [NOISE] -- I don't thi- -- I don't think, you know -- I dunno too much, basically.  I mean, I'm in a education department for like autistic children and that's why I'm like -- you know, I -- I -- I'm the happy -- I just settle for, you know, them to, like, point at something or -- or at least a [NOISE] limited [NOISE] communication [NOISE] skill, you know, but, um -- you know, [NOISE] I can't expect that much of them to read or to [inaudible] or have too much cognitive skills [NOISE] but, um, I'm not very aware of, ah, the education -- you know the programs they have nowadays [NOISE] for the children [NOISE] but ah whatever they're doing I think they should try harder because [LAUGH] [NOISE] I don't think it's working very well. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] And I know, like, a lot of those kids, all they care about is, you know, like, [NOISE] watching MTV and [SIGH] that's, like, totally not a good influence, um.  I mean, not saying everything's bad but [SIGH] you know a lot of the rap stuff is very [MN] I don't know, I guess it's violent oriented or something or just [SIGH] focusing on --
L:  Up in LA.
R:  -- focusing on --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- money and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- cars and, you know, uh, sleazy women or something. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  And if they do wanna read something it'll probably be about a biography of, uh, Puff Daddy or something [LAUGH] or other [several inaudible words] --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  And it's, like, wow, [MN] you know.  What education is in that, you know?  It's like [NOISE] [SIGH] ah, nobody these days wants to pick up like uh, [NOISE] you know, like a nice psychology [NOISE] book or something [LAUGH] and you know, read.  It's something that's gonna be, you know, fundamental for them to [NOISE] learn eventually and um -- 
R:  [SIGH] Well --
L:  -- you know, and -- and that's how they end up not [MN] going to college and wanting to pursue -- you know, ah, higher education or something, [NOISE] you know?  'Cause ah, [NOISE] they -- they don't [NOISE] give 'em, you know -- [MN] nowadays -- I know that back in my day, ah, [NOISE] which wasn't that long ago -- I mean, I -- I was almost tempted not to ge- -n college education because, it's like, they -- they really didn't have [LIPSMACK] programs.  I'm serious, like, they would just [NOISE] have kids graduating because of their age but they really wouldn't know how to read as well, you know?  So, [NOISE] i- it was just like ridiculous.  I think [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] you know, that they should uh, keep 'em back as long as they need to be kept back in order for them to be able, because it's gonna be harder on them in the long run --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and um I -- I --
R:  They just don't want to have 'em the next year in their class is [LAUGH] what it is probably. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah -- yeah.  The teachers there acted like they didn't care.  It's like, "Oh, whatever" you know?  It's like, uh, yeah [MN] I -- they would actually say like, "Oh, I'm still getting paid, you know.  You fail, you fail.  I'm still getting paid". [LAUGH] [SIGH] Yeah.  W- [MN] what motivation does that give us, you know?  So, that's why I was, like, I never even wanted to go to class.  I'd skip all the time, you know?  But luckily I turned around and you know and now I got like a three point seven GP -- but I'm starting to go but at least, you know -- [NOISE] I'm still young so I'll try to finish [LAUGH] and um, [NOISE] I always like to read.  Um, that really -- I -- I thought I had really became um -- that -- that really helped me become ah the type of person I am now by reading a lot.  I'm -- I'm [NOISE] very intellectual because of that and [NOISE] it does help so, I think, you know, that they should um, have, uh, better programs right now for 'em and, um, [LIPSMACK] they should not -- you sh- -- they should have 'em read [NOISE] a lot of books. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, but you wonder if they really --
