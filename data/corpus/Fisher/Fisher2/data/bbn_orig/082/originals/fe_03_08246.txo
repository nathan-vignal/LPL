L:  Hello.
R:  Hello. [LAUGH] 
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, my name is Michaeline.  I'm from Ohio. 
L:  I'm Fran.  I'm from Lo- -- ah Los Angeles, California.
R:  Wow.  
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  Don't you love this?  
L:  I -- 
R:  Get to talk to people all over.
L:  -- this is my first time so ... [SIGH] 
R:  Oh.  Well, this is my second time --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- so it's interesting.
L:  Yeah. [SIGH]
R:  So, I guess we should talk.  [MN] What do y- --?
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- what do you think about censorship in public schools?
L:  I don't think they should.  I think they shouldn't, [SIGH] you know, allow students to [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] read [SIGH] you know what they want to read then allow the -- the teachers -- if they're [SIGH] going to hire the teachers, then they have to have faith that those teachers that they hire are going to provide the students [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, with quality um [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- education I mean.  And that's how I feel --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- so --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- how do -- 
R:  -- yeah --
L:  -- you feel? [NOISE] 
R:  -- in literature.  [SIGH] Well, I have --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- mixed feelings --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- about it.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  I agree with that --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- I would say -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- probably ninety percent is -- 
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- how I feel about that you know. 
L:  [NOISE] Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  I mean, I think --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that --
L:  [SIGH] [NOISE] 
R:  -- for the most part when you have censorship it -- it uh --
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] 
R:  -- it does bad things you know.  [SIGH] It uh --
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] [NOISE] 
R:  -- we end up with book burning you know, etcetera etcetera.  On the other hand --
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] 
R:  -- [SIGH] I -- I don't think that's -- 
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] 
R:  -- that -- that a lack of censorship means --
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] 
R:  -- that everything that's out there is allowable.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  And I'm not sure.  You see I -- I struggle with --
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] 
R:  -- where to draw the line.  I've -- I've thought a great deal about this --
L:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] 
R:  -- because I home schooled my kids.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And one of the reasons I home schooled my kids -- one of them -- 
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- was to have more control -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- over -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  --what was going into their minds [LIPSMACK] and -- and so I -- I mean I struggle a lot with this censorship, you know this --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- censorship idea.  
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  I mean for -- for the most part I think that no, th- -- things 
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- shouldn't be censored you know --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- and that teachers should be trusted -- 
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- I was a teacher too --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and -- and -- and that they should -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- be and yet --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- there a- -- sometimes I think people go --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- over the line.
L:  Mhm. [MN] 
R:  You know?  And they'll present materials that are --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- too old --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, for a certain level.  That kind of thing.  I'm -- 
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- I'm not -- I'm not quite sure how we -- how we --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- handle that.
L:  [LIPSMACK] [MN] I think that as long as there's somebody there to answer questions and to guide them --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] um and to present them with the correct -- [SIGH] for like their age or whatever -- we're seeing in schools -- I mean where is the censorship coming from?  Is it coming from the Board?  Is it coming from the parents?  Is in coming from [SIGH] you know, other teachers?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Is it ... Where -- so where is it coming from?  But I think what they're talking about [SIGH] you know, censorship in the school, I think w- [MN] to me what it seems like they're talking about [SIGH] is um [SIGH] you know what the teachers are going to put in the curriculum.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] And I think --
R:  But you [MN] --
L:  -- at that point you know, you need to trust who you hire.
R:  But you know of course --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that most teachers --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- don't write their own --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- curriculum?
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah most of -- most of them are -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they um teach by --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- a mandated curriculum -- 
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- and a --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- lot of them d- would rather not --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- even -- and I only know this because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I have friends in this position --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they don't really want to teach --
L:  [SIGH] [NOISE] 
R:  -- what they're told to teach.
L:  [SIGH] Well, and I know they don't all do that because I know I've been taught away from the curriculum when I was in school.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  [SIGH] [NOISE] [NOISE] 
R:  And it's -- was -- [MN] when you --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- can do it it's -- I think it's -- I -- it's [SIGH] I don't know.  I think it's -- there is -- there are just [SIGH] [MN] -- I don't know.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  There are just some things.  I -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- -s 'cause I feel the same way --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- about, um, you know like internet access in the libraries.  
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  In the public libraries?
L:  [MN] Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] Yes, I -- I don't believe in censorship you know.  And -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- really true is -- I tr- -- I truly do not believe in censorship.
L:  Mhm.
R:  However, [MN] there are some things that I d- -- I don't want my --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- kids to happen to be walking -- well, my kids are older now but when they were younger I didn't want them to happen to be walking [SIGH] past a computer and see certain things --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Right well --
R:  -- you know, that were there.
L:  [SIGH] Yes, I think you know if they're under age then yes, things needed -- need to [MN] be censored if --
R:  To -- yeah, to some --
L:  -- to a certain extent --
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  -- if it's you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- vulgar, [SIGH] um too violent [NOISE] [SIGH] and that kind of thing, depending on the age.
R:  Right.  It's -- it's -- it's [SIGH] it's an interesting problem though.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH] You know, I think it really --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  -- it presents an --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- interesting problem --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- because then -- then I -- I know um ... 
L:  [NOISE]  
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, it [MN] -- I just -- I do th- -- I was glad this was the topic -- [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- because I do, I think censorship [SIGH] it's --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- it's so provocative.  It's such an -- an --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- interesting problem.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because [MN] some things --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- are [LIPSMACK] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- ah, let me see. How do I --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- even um ...?  I'm not sure where you stand faithwise, okay?  But just talking --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- generally [LIPSMACK] um --
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  -- what I see censored --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- a lot are Christian viewpoint.  You know?  That -- that a Chr- -- that a -- that a strictly Christian viewpoint is censored while um [LIPSMACK] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- perhaps a Buddhist viewpoint -- viewpoint or a Muslim viewpoint is considered allowable.  [SIGH] And I have a real problem with that.  I mean, what I think is if we're not gonna have censorship then we're not gonna have censorship.  You know?  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Nothing should be censored.  [SIGH] You know the -- the Christian viewpoint, the Buddhist viewpoint, the Jewish --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- viewpoint, you know the -- the Muslim --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:   -- viewpoint.  All viewpoints should be --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- allowed, you know, at that point -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and I -- I just wonder who it is?  I think part of my problem is with ah censorship or lack of censorship is --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- who's choosing?  Who -- you know -- who's choosing it?
L:  Right.
R:  What is censorship to one is not censorship to another you know.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  And what is no censorship to one is censorship to another.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  And I just -- I think um -- I don't know.  It's -- I think it's just kind of uh -- it's perplexing.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE]  
R:  You know, it's perplexing.  I wonder how we -- I wonder how we stop it you know, or I wonder [SIGH] -- I wonder how -- wonder how we take care of it --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and still give our kids the opportunity to ah, you know, explore and read and -- and learn without saying that anything goes.
L:  [SIGH] W- -- well, I think that's where the trust comes in.
R:  [SIGH] Yes.  I --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- couldn't disagree with you on that one.
L:  Right.
R:  Couldn't disa- -- yeah ...
L:  And [SIGH] that there's certain things and what you're saying -- uh well I disagree -- that you're saying more of the Buddhist uh and the Eastern religions are accepted more than the Christian religions in the schools because it seems like to me that it's more the Christian religion that's in the schools [SIGH] and -- and more of the other types that are more put down.  [SIGH] But that's just -- 
R:  Well, I --
L:  -- you know, the way I see it.
R:  -- yeah.  Well, no I merely used that as an example --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of a possibility.  You know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I m- -- I mean it could be the same that in a -- that in a school [SIGH] the Buddhist viewpoint is not allowed.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  I just -- I used that just merely as -- as an example.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] I don't think any of them should be --
L:  -- [SIGH] 
R:  -- disallowed if we're saying that -- that there is uh --
L:  Right.  If you allow one then you allow the rest of them.
R:  Right.  R- -- right, yeah.
L:  Correct.
R:  So w- -- with no um --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] um [MN] -- no bias --
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  -- no bias.  And I know I don't feel like that's the case at all.
L:  Mm. [LIPSMACK] Well, there's gonna -- it's the human factor.
R:  Right, exactly right.
L:  Who's ever teaching it --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- is gonna have their bias in it and I think it's really [SIGH] sometimes hard just to get a pure opinion.
R:  [SIGH] Oh I think so.  I -- I would definitely --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- agree on that.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I think it's very difficult.
L:  And that's why you home schooled, right? [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh well, that's -- oh that's part of the reason --
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  -- just -- I had many, many, many reasons for home schooling.
L:  [SIGH] Okay. [LAUGH] 
R:  That -- that was one of them though.
L:  [LAUGH] One of them -- yeah. [SIGH] 
R:  You know, that -- that -- that definitely was one of them.  What I wanted was um -- what I wanted too -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- was I wanted my kids to have the strength to be able --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- to um to resist, you know?
L:  [NOISE] Mm.
R:  To resist certain -- certain ideas when they got out into the world rather than -- you know.  But it's- you know, like I say, home school isn't for everybody.  It definitely was for us but you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's not for everybody.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  [SIGH] They're in college now, doing very well.  Very socially you know -- [LAUGH] [SIGH] -- very socially adapted so I'm not real concerned about it [LAUGH] at this point.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I know that it works for us but uh, [SIGH] I dunno though.  The whole -- the whole censorship concept, I feel like there's -- there's a real thin line there, you know?  I mean I d- -- 
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- I don't think --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that most people would agree that anything goes.
L:  [SIGH] No.
R:  But it's uh -- but it's a matter of what you consider "anything" [LAUGH] you know?
L:  [SIGH] Mhm.
R:  And I just uh -- I -- I wonder.  I just -- I wonder ... yeah.
L:  I think for adults --
R:  Right.
L:  -- is one thing and for children is another --
R:  I agree [MN] -- yes.  I agree too.  I agree absolutely --
L:  -- [MN] --
R:  -- you know.
L:  -- because I think adults are more able to filter out for themselves.
R:  R- -- oh yeah.  [MN] Yeah that's right.  And it's their choice.
L:  Mhm.
R:  What they put in their minds is their choice.
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  You know?  Little minds though will take whatever you give 'em.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  And they're so -- they're sponge like.  They'll take it whether they understand it or not too.
L:  Mm.
R:  That's like -- [MN] I think that's the most interesting thing about it all but -- I --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Right, but also they need a lot of different opinions --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  [SIGH] [MN] -- to be able to expand.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  Absolutely.  Absolutely agree with that.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm. [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah, I think that's interesting.
L:  Mm-kay. 
R:  That's very -- yeah very interesting.  What are your schools like?
L:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] Ah --
R:  In your area?
L:  Oh boy, you know?  My kids are in their twenties.  My son's at the u- -- in a university --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um my daughter's you know, well out of school and married --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so it's been a long time since my children have been in school --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- [SIGH] um [NOISE] [MN] but uh they -- when -- I know when I went to school here, which was a long time [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah [LAUGH] --
L:  -- you know [LAUGH] it was pretty open -- open.
R:  I -- if your kids are your twenties, you and I are about the same age. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  My kids are in their twenties. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  We -- we know what it was like.  Yeah, that's right.  We know what [LAUGH] schools are like, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, um [NOISE] [MN] you know, it seem like it depends -- and then also it depends on the teacher. [SIGH] 
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  And then depends on if they're going to follow and not put any -- you know, just follow whatever the you know curriculum is and whatever the approved book is and just kind of you know, blandly let you know about, you know, what's ever in the book --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and just kind of go about --
