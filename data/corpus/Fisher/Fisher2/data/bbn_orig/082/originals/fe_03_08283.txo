L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.  Hi, my name is Susan.
L:  Hi, Susan, my name is Shannon.
R:  How are you? [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm good. [LAUGH] How are you? [SIGH] 
R:  Good.  Was the topic censorship or was it about books at public schools? [LAUGH] 
L:  The -- I -- I think both. [SIGH] 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Whether is -- well, what I heard was that [SIGH] books in public or private schools, can they be banned, so I guess it's both.
R:  [SIGH] Oh, okay. So, what do you think?
L:  So, this my first time --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- doing this, so  [LAUGH] 
R:  Me too.  I have no idea what's going on. [LAUGH] 
L:  Neither do I.  Well, let's see.  Um, [SIGH] no, I don't think they should be censored. [SIGH] 
R:  Uh, i- in schools they shouldn't censor books?
L:  I don't think.
R:  I think maybe depending on the age.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  I don't know, 'cause I could understand why, like, you know, maybe in third grade they wouldn't --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- want a kid t- you know, that it's all a bit ahead, you know, to grab a Catcher in the Rye copy, but --
L:  Right, I agree with you. I- if it's [SIGH] -- if the book -- it -- it should be age appropriate.
R:  Yeah, I agree.
L:  But I don't think they can say -- 'cause I know I just recently heard on the news that [LIPSMACK] there was one book that, [SIGH] uh, they were -- I can't even tell you where it was, but they didn't want to let it, uh, in the schools because it was [SIGH] written back in the forties and it used a lot of derogatory language towards, [SIGH] uh, African Americans and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and stuff like that, but, you know, that's just our history and we're not going to learn from it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if we don't know [MN] what our mistakes were, so .
R:  I agree, especially if they were going to use for a course, if they gave it a proper introduction.
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know, like, "This is what you should look for in this book.  It's -- but you should know it's, like, seen as negative.  This is why some people, like, you -- rather not read it, but "  You know.
L:  Exactly. [SIGH] do you have any children?
R:  [SIGH] No, no, I'm twenty three.  How about you? [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Uh, I'm twenty nine, I have a three year old, so [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- right now we don't extend past the, uh, Scooby Do and [SIGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- Sponge Bob Square Pants. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I haven't [SIGH] come across those issues yet, but, uh --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [SIGH] this is kinda weird. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Um, so, it's, like, when you were a child back in high school, would you like them to, like, censor what they can or can't read, or ?
L:  No.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] I don't think so.  I mean, [SIGH] this'd probably be easier if we were d- arguing. [LAUGH] 
R:  I know.
L:  [LAUGH] But --
R:  I know, we agree too much. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] We're agreeing but, uh --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- no, I mean, [SIGH] like I said, we -- we can't learn from our mistakes, uh, uh, unless we know what they are and [SIGH] [MN] I wouldn't -- I mean, [SIGH] I would -- would not want to have any pornographic material --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] but that's just common sense.
R:  Yeah, well, I was thinking --
L:  That's just common sense.
R:  -- 'cause a friend just gave me copy of an Anais Nin book [SIGH] and, like, it's amazing, I think her thoughts are, like, you know, really [inaudible] and her language is beautiful, but it's got a lot of, like, erotic scenes in it.  I'm like, I can unders- [SIGH] it would be, like, a tough call, you know what I mean?  Like, it's really sexual, I think maybe seniors in high school could handle it, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- younger than that it's --
L:  See they didn't have --
R:  -- kind of iffy.
L:  -- [SIGH] you know, the books I read in high school were all appropriate, you know, like, Sid Harter I remember and [SIGH] -- and, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, Tale of Two Cities and -- and all that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- stuff.  There wasn't anything -- [SIGH] we did read Catcher in the Rye, but I didn't [SIGH] -- I never thought it was --
R:  It wasn't that bad, no.
L:  -- [MN] exactly.  It's not that big a deal, so, [SIGH] uh, [SIGH] like I said p- pornography probably sh- I -- I don't [MN] -- I mean, I just -- it depends on the subject.  I mean, if you're in a history class [SIGH] the books should be about history, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if you're in math, math, or science, science, you know, [SIGH] it -- and -- and it -- like you said, even if is something offensive or derogatory, [SIGH] uh, then that needs to be +introduced.
R:  Yeah, I agree.
L:  [MN] I remember -- I don't know if you read this book, but it was, uh, Anne Frank's Diary.
R:  Okay, actually I didn't read that one.
L:  Yeah, and that was -- you know, that was a big deal because that was pretty intense as regards to the holocaust and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [SIGH] and -- and that kind of stuff and we read it and, you know, we --we learned from it and [MN] w- you just moved on, you know, it wasn't, uh -- [SIGH] it wasn't really that big a deal. [LAUGH] 
R:  No, I think it's good that it makes you think, though, because I -- I remember so many of the books that we read in high school are so stale [SIGH] and it seems like when you get to college and, like, I read this in high school, that in high school, everyone read the same thing in high school.
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know, like, everyone read The Scarlet Letter, Wuthering Heights or something like that --
L:  Right. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and everyone read some Dickens and that. [NOISE] It's like -- kind of like there's so much more literature that they could, you know, find something they liked --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- instead of just getting the same thing that their parents read that's kind of stale --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- in a way, you know?
L:  Well, you know, the one I -- I -- I've always been a -- a huge book reader.  I read constantly and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I always was -- [SIGH] they never -- yeah, they never had anything, um, contemporary.
R:  Right, and --
L:  It was all these classics, you know, and they ne- didn't introduce you to any of the -- any of the new styles which are really good and [SIGH] [MN] that -- that was kinda odd, I thought.
R:  Yeah, and then you get to college and there's all these choices, like, you take a beat class, you could take, like, an African American literature --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- class, even though it's good because you're not familiar with any of it because you always read, like, you know, British literature, like, in high school, you know?
L:  R- right.
R:  [NOISE] So.
L:  [SIGH] No, I -- I totally agree [LAUGH] with you.
R:  [LAUGH] It's, uh -- really want to argue. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, well, let's see, uh [LAUGH] -- [SIGH] how much time do we have? [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh, we're on to five minutes. [NOISE] It -- I just remember in, um -- [LIPSMACK] in my freshman year of high school we were t- we were in, like, a global studies class and we read a book called Kafir Boy [SIGH] and it was about a black boy growing up in, uh, South Africa before apartheid was lifted, [SIGH] and it was like --
L:  What was the name of the book?
R:  Kafir Boy.  I guess it means slave or something, uh, it was a long time ago. [SIGH] But it was an amazing book about what he went through, and there was, like, a one page scene where, like, this gay man approached him and tried to use him for food or something, like, you know, like, solicit him for food.
L:  Right.
R:  And this kid's mom threw a fit and we had to stop reading the book and, like, turn it back and everything and I was so frustrated because it was such a cool book and it was, like, really eye opening and, like, it was --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- one page, you know, it was --
L:  That was a -- you were a freshman in college?
R:  [NOISE] Uh, no, no, high school, high school.
L:  Oh, in high school, oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] I'm like, "College --"
R:  But it was -- oh, no, no.
L:  "-- gosh I can't believe a mother would [SIGH] --"
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  "-- [SIGH] get upset or anything". [SIGH] 
R:  oh, my god, [SIGH] that would have been on the news. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] yeah, I know. [LAUGH] Mom stops class. [SIGH] Yeah, no, you know, um, uh, my mom was always really cool about the books I read and -- and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, things like that, you know, and, [SIGH] um, [MN] [SIGH] I can't e- I [MN] -- I do remember there was -- a- and now that I think [MN] back on it, there was a little bit of a [SIGH] -- [MN] one of the parents was pretty upset 'cause there wasn't enough, um, [LIPSMACK] cultural books.
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH] I remember, like, the entire time in high school I think we would of read one book --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that was about, uh, Mexicans and Mexico and -- and -- and it was set back, uh, like a hundred years ago and [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and that was it.  And everything else was -- was all America, Caucasian, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- straight down the line and [SIGH] so you didn't get too much of that really. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] I agree, like, I -- actually I have a roommate right now and she's going to be a kindergarten teacher, and, like, [NOISE] the books are so diverse, like, do they have African stories and they have Asian stories --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and it's not -- [SIGH] and I'm like, they can introduce that at kindergarten, yet when you get to the high school level it's the same stuff that they've been introducing for, like, a hundred years, like, come on. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I -- I know, really. [SIGH] Yeah, I -- I've notice that, too, the diversity in -- in children's book when -- 'cause, [MN] you know, I read to my daughter a lot and, um --
R:   Mhm.
L:  -- it's way more than it was when I [LAUGH] was a kid.
R:  Yeah, like, what -- what did we have when we were little, like, Dr Seuss? [LAUGH] 
L:  Exactly. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Exactly.
R:  Which was fine, but --
L:  But all her books, they show -- I mean, [SIGH] [MN] frie- e- even the cartoons, you know, friends, you know, they're different colors or, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, and -- and it's just -- and they -- no big deal is made out of it and that's really wonderful so --
R:  It is.
L:  -- [SIGH] they -- they should con-- you -- we just need the divi- diversity in schools, you know. [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah, I don't -- it makes you kind of wonder if, like, diversity is a bad thing 'cause, like, you know, that -- that used to be the -- [SIGH] the stereotype because you look at books that, like, people have been reading in high school forever and it's like, if it's different it's bad.
L:  Right.
R:  I -- I don't know, it's kind of scary.
L:  [SIGH] Well, I don't know, it -- 'cause you -- you know, you just got to think, if they're going to ban one books, what's going to make them stop [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- at another book and when's it ever going to end.  It's kinda like music [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- do you, you know [MN] -- I'm sorry.
R:  [LIPSMACK] No, I agree then.
L:  Oh, I'm sorry, I thought I heard something else. Um, [SIGH] it's, yeah, exactly like music, I don't remember, uh, several years ago they were -- actually wanted to ban, um, this band called Public Enemy. [SIGH] 
R:  Right, I remember that.
L:  And, yeah, they were -- I mean, their music was -- I mean, same as books, it was very controversial, but, you know, if you do one where is it ever going to stop, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] you just -- it's all about freedom of speech and -- and -- and all that, and [MN] [SIGH] it's a tough call because you know, there -- there's probably a lot of things I probably wouldn't -- my -- want my daughter to see or listen to, but, [SIGH] you know, [SIGH] you just -- you can't [MN] -- you just can't stop here because you know they're going to take it one step further.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] Okay, well, [SIGH] "Oh, they said this word, you know, we're got to ban this".  Or, "Oh, you know, they're showing [SIGH] gays and lesbians here, you know, let's ban that" and then -- then it just gets into a whole thing and they just never stop.
R:  [SIGH] Probably.
L:  [SIGH] I'm saying "they" like there's a big group, but you know what I'm saying. [SIGH] 
R:  [SIGH] I totally, like -- I was -- the thing to do with censorship, like, I got thinking about -- my friend dragged me a Dixie Chicks concert a couple of weeks ago.
L:  Mhm, what concert?
R:  And -- Dixie Chicks.  And, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they were all, like, against Dixie Chicks --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- because they said something against Bush.
L:  Right, I remember. [LAUGH] 
R:  And we were at the concert and some guy started booing them [SIGH] and then she was like, "I love booing, it just symbolizes freedom of speech".
L:  Right.
R:  And everyone started clapping for her because it's true, like, you know, everyone should be -- like, why can't they state their opinion, you know, and --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- you know?  But --
L:  [SIGH] I remember when that happened and -- and their record sales really went [LAUGH] down and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] the people were like, "Oh, boohoo on the Dixie Chicks" you know, but [MN] they said what they wanted to say, you know, and [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah, the -- the best part is you don't have to agree, I mean --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the -- that --
L:  Just because they said it doesn't that's what everybody thinks.
R:  [NOISE] Totally. [NOISE] [SIGH] This is so hard because we agree so much, it's [NOISE] [inaudible].
L:  I know, we're like, "Okay".
R:  Because the conversation's like, "You're right, you're right". [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Oh, my gosh. [NOISE] [SIGH] So, what are you reading right now? [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, actually I'm reading a Stephen King book. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, which one?
L:  [SIGH] Misery.
R:  [SIGH] Okay, I never read any Stephen King, I'm kinda like --
L:  Oh, my god.
R:  No.
L:  I love Stephen King. [SIGH] I have all his books and I've r- read and reread them, like, a hundred times and --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- [SIGH] and then I have a fairy tale book that I read to my daughter at night, so that's -- so we're k-
R:  Oh, I love those.
L:  Yeah, oh, I do too.  They're -- those are really cool so --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] but, uh --
R:  Oh, this is kinda weird, it's back on the subject kind of, I, uh, just --
