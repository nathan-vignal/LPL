R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Hi, my name is Chris.
R:  [NOISE] My name's Tracey.
L:  Hi Tracey.  How are you?
R:  I'm good.  How are you? [NOISE] 
L:  Good -- good.  Trying to figure out where you're from.
R:  I'm from Florida.
L:  Ah.  I was gonna say the South. [LAUGH] I'm in -- in Buffalo, New York area.
R:  Ah.
L:  So.  But I think we're just about as hot as you [LAUGH] guys are right now. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So -- so the topic is public and private schools and should they be able to censor the books?
R:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] I -- I guess so.  This --
L:  This --
R:  -- is the first one of these I've done.  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's the first one I've done [LIPSMACK] so it's a learning experience for both of us.  Um, and you said your --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- name was Tracey?
R:  Yes. [NOISE] 
L:  Okay.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Um, anyway I think --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that neither a public or a private school has the right to censor books the children read.
R:  N- neither do I.  I --
L:  I- it --
R:  -- I learned a lot at school from being able to read whatever I wanted to [NOISE] and I -- I just don't -- I mean unless it's [NOISE] adult material but --
L:  Right.  
R:  -- other than that, I don't think so. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah I mean, I don't want a book -- I don't want a fourth grader reading a book you know, that's Lady Chatterley's Lover --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or something.  You know?  But common sense should be exercised.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I don't think they should be able to ban anything.
L:  No -- no -- no.  
R:  [MN] [NOISE] 
L:  That's censorship and I believe we have the right --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- not to be censored. 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [MN] So 
R:  I definitely agree.  I mean [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the book you mentioned before was one I did read but it was in like my senior year of high school.
L:  Exactly -- exactly.  Yup -- yup.
R:  And --
L:  Tracey, I'm gonna ask you to hang on while I just plug my phone in --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- 'cause I don't want to lose you in the middle.  Hold on. 
R:  Sure.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] Okay.  All right. 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  So, yeah -- no it was -- you know, I -- I did read it too but again I was a senior or --
R:  Mm. [NOISE] 
L:  -- it may have been right after --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- high school.  But um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know that does- -- that book doesn't --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- belong in an elementary school.
R:  No.  I -- I think --
L:  Um --
R:  -- a lot of the things that [NOISE] some parents --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- at schools and stuff want to ban are --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the things that kids learn the most from. [NOISE] 
L:  [MN] That's very true um but -- ooh -- we had a -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- ow -- big opera round [NOISE] here when Harry Potter came out.
R:  [NOISE] Really?  I've --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- read all of those and I love them. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, I -- I love them too.  I think they're absolutely wonderful and I --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- think they serve --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- no other purpose than to get kids who --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- wouldn't ordinarily pick up a book to pick up a book.
R:  [NOISE] Exactly.  And I -- I --
L:  And --
R:  -- think -- I -- I don't think it's teaching kids [MN] --
L:  Witchcraft.
R:  -- what a lot of people think.  No.
L:  Yeah.  I mean that's [NOISE] just stupid.  [LAUGH] Um --
R:  I mean it's -- it's [NOISE] quite obvious that they're [NOISE] --
L:  -- Yeah.
R:  -- fantasy. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, but they're -- they actually had --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- school board meetings with parents showing up saying, "I want these books taken out of the library".
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  "I don't want them read in the English classes and --" 
R:  Ooh wow.  I haven't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- heard about anything like that around here luckily but --
L:  [MN] Yeah -- yeah.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Fortunately the school board --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it ha- -- you know, kept their --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- mind --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and -- and didn't agree to do that.
R:  No.  [NOISE] If -- if you don't want your kids reading it it's your business to tell them not to.
L:  That's right.
R:  That's the school's business to monitor what they read. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.  But they -- they do not have to ban it from the schools [MN] it's just -- 
R:  [SIGH] [NOISE] 
L:  -- I think that's wrong.
R:  That's silly. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yes it is.  It's very --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- silly.  So [LIPSMACK] -- but um, and -- and the difference between public and private --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- schools?  I don't --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- think there is any.
R:  I -- I don't think so.  Not any more.  Maybe --
L:  You know.
R:  -- once upon a time but --
L:  Right.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Y- you know a Catholic --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- school may not --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- want them -- or I can see a Catholic school not wanting the kids to read --
R:  That one I can understand but [NOISE] --
L:  -- you know.  But still -- 
R:   -- a non religious private school? [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Doesn't make any sense.
L:  That's right.  Yup -- yup.  Definitely.  I just feel that um -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- especially, I -- I don't know if you have kids but my own daughter is mature enough even at thirteen --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to know what's an acceptable book and what's not.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Um, she has enough common sense that, you know, if there's something she doesn't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- understand or if there's a problem [MN] she -- she would come to me --
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE] And --
L:  -- and ask if I thought she should continue reading it.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE] And you know what?  That's probably a good thing 'cause that's the way I was.  And my mom --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- didn't say a lot. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  She just kind of let me do my own thing and [SIGH] it -- it worked for me.
L:  Yeah -- yeah. [MN]
R:  My son's only nine months and he's just into chewing on board books but --
L:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, uh-huh, well you better keep those away from him. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But uh, I don't think you have to ban them totally --
R:  No. [NOISE] 
L:  -- um, you know, but just for --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- any --
R:  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  -- oh [MN] for a school to --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [MN] come in and say, "Okay, we -- we are not going to allow our students to have access to Harry Potter.  We are not going to allow our students to ah, bring that book into the school", that's wrong.
R:  It seems to be [NOISE] discouraging exactly what school is for.  You discourage them to read one thing [NOISE] then they're not going to want to read what they're supposed to.  They want to read what they want to read. [NOISE] 
L:  Right.  Yeah -- yeah.
R:  It's important for them to be interested in what they're reading.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh yeah.  And you know --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- if it's -- [MN] some of the books that my daughter -s had --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- to read have been fairly boring but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there's been an aw- -- an awful lot of them that she's -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- really loved -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and she -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- she has a love of reading --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and I don't want the school telling her, "Uh, no gee sorry, you can't read that".
R:  Exactly.  And I -- I think --
L:  They did try uh with one book --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- a series of books.  Ah, they didn't want to let her do a book report on it --
R:  Really?
L:  -- but  Yeah.  It was the Left Behind series.  I don't know if you're familiar with that but it's a -- a -- definitely a religious --
R:  Right.
L:  -- type series.
R:  I haven't read them but when I was working --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- in a bookstore they were excellent sellers --
L:  Oh yeah.  Yeah, that's excellent.
R:   -- and I've heard plenty of people, even non religious people, that came in and told me they were excellent books just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- even for just entertainment.
L:  Exactly -- exactly.  Ther- --
R:  And they sold like hot cakes. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  They were science --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- fiction to -- to somebody that wasn't reading it for the religious aspect --
R:  Yeah.  I --
L:  -- and --
R:  -- I can't imagine why they'd tell --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- her she can't do that.  Especially --
L:  Right.
R:  -- as her age is kind of advanced.
L:  Yeah -- yeah.  Exactly and um, I think this was last year and she had to do the book report.  She'd just read the book so I said, "Well, why don't you do it on that?" an- --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and the teacher said, "Well, I think that's too mature for her".  I said, "If she read and she understands it".  "Well, it's not really the type of book we encourage them --"
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  "-- to read".  "Well, that's not the point --"
R:  Well, if she never --
L:  "-- they are to choose a book --"
R:  -- specified what they could and couldn't read --
L:  No -- no.
R:  -- if she wanted them to read specific things then she should have given them a list.
L:  Exactly -- exactly. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But they were supposed --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- to go out on their own, find something that interested them and do it.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, why [MN] w- when[?] she's right?  And this wasn't one of the kids' versions.  This was one of the adult versions.
R:  Yeah.  And --
L:  And you know why make the kid read a two hundred and fifty, three hundred page book and then say, "Oh sorry you can't use that"?
R:  I -- I can't imagine a teacher discouraging something like that.  Especially as advanced as that is --
L:  Yeah -- yeah -- yeah, so 
R:  -- for the age [NOISE] you mentioned.  I mean --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  And she -- she did finally.  I -- 'cause the guidance counselor, I spoke to her and she said, "Oh no, she actually is capable of reading it and understanding it --"
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  "-- and writing about it" --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- so she was able to do it and turned it in and got an A on the paper, so.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah --
R:  Good for her.
L:  -- it was worked -- worked out wonderfully.
R:  I just don't see any sense in it. [COUGH]
L:  Yeah --
R:  Doesn't --
L:  --I -- I don't either. 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Um [MN] -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- there are certain [SIGH] -- I guess the biggest thing i- is as long as the books are age appropriate for whatever school --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, if you're in an elementary school you're going to have Dr Seuss and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, See Dick Run or whatever and that's fine.
R:  And I think [LIPSMACK] [MN] I guess it's more important for the parents to say, "You know, I -- I don't want you reading those" [SIGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- not for the schools to say. [NOISE] 
L:  Exactly.  Yeah, the parents should have more say [NOISE] than the schools, that's for sure. [NOISE] [MN] 
R:  And I mean, if you don't want your kids reading Harry Potter --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- in the library then tell them [NOISE] they can't -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- check that book out.
L:  Exactly.  Yeah.
R:  Don't take it out of the library for the kids that do want to read it [NOISE] and their parents don't have a problem with it.
L:  [NOISE] Right.  Yeah.  [MN] I -- I agree wholeheartedly.  I think that, um, it's the parents' place.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  It's the family's place.  It is not the school's place to censor --
R:  [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] No.
L:  -- the children so --
R:  And I mean I think if you were to give them that much then y- -- where do you stop them?
L:  Right -- right.  Exactly.  So then, they tell them they can't do this, they can't do that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] So then, you're kind of back to a police state. [LAUGH] 
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know, and there is --
R:  And they're in school, not in prison.
L:  Exactly.  Yep, I agree.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] So, but it was um [LIPSMACK] -- you know.  And there's th- other little battle the parents have to fight if they do think [NOISE] that schools are trying to censor the students.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, they have to [MN] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- back up the students and they have to speak up and tell the school boards, tell the teachers --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- let them know exactly what [NOISE] um [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- what they aren't to -- whether or not schools should have the right to --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- censor book reading.
R:  Yeah.  I -- 
L:  [NOISE] My daughter's looking at me like, "No, they shouldn't" [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- so, no they hadn't -- uh I agree.  [NOISE] So -- [NOISE] yes.  Yeah, yes she did.  She's just remembered about the Left Behind book --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so [NOISE] -- so.  I don't know, Ashleigh.  It's a long story. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  If you're looking for a stranger [LAUGH] she's in Florida.
R:  [NOISE] I mean, I figure, you said she was thirteen? [NOISE] 
L:  Yes.  Mhm.
R:  I- it's amazing to me for her to be that far ahead in her reading.
L:  [NOISE] Oh y- --
R:  To even be able to read --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that.  I don't [NOISE] understand why a teacher would --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- say, "No, you can't --"
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  "-- do that now".
L:  Yeah.  I know. [NOISE] 
R:  I -- I think she'd be more happy with the fact that she learned so much and she can read and understand that.
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  Yeah she -- and she -- like I said, she did a great job on it so there is -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- to me it was just a non issue and the -- the teacher didn't have the right to say, "No, you're not --"
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  "-- you know, you don't have the ability or whatever".
R:  Right.  I- --
L:  If she turned in a lousy paper that would be one thing but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it still would have nothing to do with the [NOISE] book she chose. [NOISE] 
R:  No.
L:  So  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  But it's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- just um -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] it -- it's just wrong.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Pretty much. [LAUGH] 
L:  Just wrong for them to try and censor --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- so  and people fought for the right not to censor -- have things --
