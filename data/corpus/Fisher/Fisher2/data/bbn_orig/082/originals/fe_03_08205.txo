L:  Hi, my name's Carrie.
R:  Hi, I'm Katya.
L:  Hi Katya.
R:  Hi.
L:  This is the first time I've done one of these.
R:  Me too.  We're both --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, no.  I was hoping somebody else would know what to do.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, the topic of conversation is whether they can al- censor books in schools, private schools or public schools?  Did they specify?
L:  They said both.
R:  Okay.
L:  Which is a difference [LAUGH].  Because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think private schools have the right to have more control than public schools.
R:  They do have the right to have more control because also the people are choosing those schools for a specific reason.
L:  Right.
R:  But [PAUSE] --
L:  Do you think public schools should have those -- should cen- --
R:  No.  No.  I don't think that there should really be all that much censorship in public schools.  I don't know, you -- whenever you go to the library and there's that list of banned books and they're always so absurd --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, ah, or most of them are, um, you know, that makes sense.  But at the same time, like, if they're trying to take the censors off in libraries so um so pornography websites would sort of be readily available more so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- ah because it's sort of inhibiting people's searches, um, I don't know.  Like there are lines to draw, I guess, but I'm never really into -- I -- I wouldn't be comfortable with people censoring books in public schools.
L:  No.  Me either [LAUGH].  Although as a parent I reserve the right to censor what my kids read.
R:  Yeah.  Which is a great option.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah and that --
L:  That should be remain my option.
R:  Yeah.  And it is your option --
L:  That --
R:  -- that's the great thing about being a parent.
L:  Right.  Are you a parent?
R:  No, I'm not.  But do you ever worry that -- well, I mean -- and I don't know exactly what you would censor from your children that they'd be able to get in the public library, you know, a public school library -- um --
L:  Actually, with my kids, not much.  My kids, I pretty much trust them --
R:  I know.
L:  -- to make their own decisions.  If they're uncomfortable reading something they'll stop --
R:  How old are your children?
L:  Um, I actually have kids that are twenty four, thirteen and eleven.
R:  Wow.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's great.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's a range.
L:  But like -- like um my thirteen was kinda interested in um Wicca and witchcraft this year --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and was getting books from the library to read about it, about -- as a religion and -- and just to learn more --
R:  That's cool --
L:  -- and I --
R:  That's r- --
L:  -- thought it was cool.
R:  It is.  I mean, that's, you know, it's -- it's kind of creepy and dark but that's so wonderful that he was sort of researching it and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- learning about it.  I mean, I'm -- see, I -- I could see how that would freak some parents out, but I wouldn't really know why.  I wouldn't actually respect that, you know, that would really make some people uncomfortable.
L:  Well, in talking with the librarian at our public library, she said it's hard for her to have these books available because there's a very strong kind of right wing, very conservative Christian group --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- who are very vocal about not wanting this in the library.  They want to censor what's available to other kids.
R:  Wow.
L:  So -- and that -- that made for a very interesting conversation.
R:  That's hard.  And I'm not really sure what the purpose of a Christian Science reading room is, but there should maybe be just another sort of private library for people that want to censor.
L:  I think most -- most churches maintain their own libraries for their communities, don't they?
R:  I don't know.  I --
L:  I --
R:  -- you know what, actually that's -- I've never really been a churchgoer.  My father was Jewish and my mother was Catholic --
L:  Oh, okay, you got guilt from both sides, huh? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Guilt from both sides.  And -- and no -- and no institution.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I never was raised within an institution.  I don't really relate to whether or not the churches would have a library.  I'm sure you're right, though.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I --
R:  Ah --
L:  I -- we're in the same boat.  I grew up in a -- my father was Catholic, my mother was Methodist who converted um but neither one of them was -- had very strong convictions, so I've been sort of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- without organized religion, um, which I thought was very interesting why my -- my thirteen year old would start looking for the religious side of Wicca [LAUGH].
R:  That is.  And, I don't know, it's [LIPSMACK] huh, so did you ever feel like you were -- ha -- had conversations with your friends that were raised within the institution of religion and that you just had a totally different experience growing up than they did?
L:  Um, yeah.  Although being Catholic I identified with my Jewish friends a lot --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- with similar religious [PAUSE] um I don't know, ethics, values.  You know, the guilt thing [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, the guilt thing.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  There's a lot of that [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] There's a lot of that.
L:  Which I thought the Catholic and Jewish faiths were -- were very similar in a lot of ways.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but I had a harder time identifying with um friends who were more Protestant.  And I don't know, --
R:  Where were you raised?
L:  Um, right near Detroit.  Where are you from?
R:  I'm from um -- from Seattle --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and we don't h- -- I haven't even -- I never even was around Protestants.  I hear about Protestants from friends --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that were raised in the mid west --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and they're like, "Who -- who is this tribe that you call Protestant?" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- sort of [LAUGH].
L:  Well, I guess they're all here in the mid west. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It's so great, though.  I mean because um [LIPSMACK] I mean it -- the -- the only way I'd identify them is Garrison Keeler's[?] Prairie Home Companion sort of --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- his commentary on Protestants --
L:  Lutheranism, yes [LAUGH].
R:  Gosh.  That's so good.  And where are you located?  Are you -- are you ...?
L:  I'm still in the metro Detroit area.
R:  Nice.
L:  Are you still in west coast?
R:  No, I moved to New York, which was a brave idea.
L:  Oh, switched coasts, huh?
R:  [LAUGH] Switched coasts.  It's so funny, people from the Dominican Republic, they're like, "Lady, you're so far from home, you're brave, what are you doing?" I'm like, "Well, you're from another country" and they say, "Yeah, but it only takes me two hours to get home --"
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  "-- it takes you six" you know [LAUGH].  It's so funny.
L:  [MN]
R:  So, huh -- now, with -- how did -- let me see, so, he was studying Wicca --
L:  Yes, it's actually she, my daughter, yeah.
R:  She.  I'm sorry.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and what did she find -- what d- what'd she talk about when she talks about it?  Like, what was so involved -- what involved her in this?
L:  I think the fact that it empowers women.
R:  That's really interesting.
L:  Yeah, she's talked about that, that it's women who have control and power and most organized religions don't give that to women [LAUGH].
R:  Wow.  And this is the fourteen year old?
L:  Yeah.  Thirteen, right.
R:  Thirteen.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Huh.  That's -- well, that's really, I mean, that's a wonderful re- um, I -- I wonder if she's going to start studying other sort of matriarchal societies?
L:  I don't know.  I don't know.
R:  And, I mean, the mysticism must be really interesting --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- with um --
L:  I think that's what she thought was -- was kinda attractive to begin with.  And then as she did more reading she commented on the -- the empowerment of women in it um and just the wh- entirely empowering kind of feeling that you could take action and control things rather than be passive.
R:  That'd be so nice.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  If she could learn to --
R:  I guess one can do --
L:  -- be more [LAUGH] -- yeah --
R:  -- that for the most part.  But it's sort of hard to feel that way all in all -- all the time.
L:  Right.
R:  And d- so, do you -- have you gone to quite a few parent teacher or the -- the -- the school sort of p- what is it, PTA meetings, then?
L:  Ah, I try not to [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Nobody could blame you.
L:  Actually, I've had two different -- it's almost like having two different families, my -- my son being twenty four and then the other two being, you know, ten years, twelve years younger --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um with my son, he went to a private school, I was very involved with, um, parent activities in the school um and I also was a lot younger and had more energy [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, with the other two, they've gone to public school and I've kind of tried to avoid a lot of those things where a lot of politics become involved, you know, parent groups and yeah, um, I still feel guilty that I don't do as much.
R:  How come?  You're -- just because you're just -- you're kind of tired of it.  You've been through it already, is that it?
L:  I've been through it.  Yeah, I've been through it.  I went through it one time, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Second time around it's just not so attractive.
R:  I understand.  My mother, she was always trying to sort of get out of the things because they -- they'd just pin something on you, "Okay, you're the secretary, this is the okay, now you have to spend thirty hours a week doing this", like "Okay" --
L:  Yeah.  Well --
R:  -- um and is -- is -- are these two different families that you have from two different marriages?
L:  No.  Actually, um, same marriage, ah, my twenty four -- four year old is my biological child --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um and we couldn't have anymore, which we didn't find out till later, so we adopted two -- two girls.
R:  That's wonderful.
L:  Um, and my daughters are both from Korea.
R:  Wow.  That's -- that's really --
L:  So, it's kinda like two families in one.
R:  -- interesting and special.
L:  But [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  So, have you been to Korea?
L:  No, I haven't.  Um, but the girls would both love to go and I'm hoping to -- 
R:  Do you imagine you'll take them?
L:  -- take them in the next -- yeah.  I
