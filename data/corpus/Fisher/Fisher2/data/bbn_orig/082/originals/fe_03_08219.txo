L:  Hi, my name is Judy.
R:  Hi, Judy.  I'm Jenny.  How are you?
L:  Hi.  Nice -- good, thank you.  Nice to meet you.
R:  Have you ever done this before?
L:  Ah, I did it a while ago, yes.
R:  Oh.  Okay.  My first time. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  Well, enjoy it.
R:  Ah, it's funny.  My daughter's just moving back from Japan and considering whether or not she's going to send her daughter to a private school versus a public school because of the ah [LIPSMACK] crowded area and ah but this was on ah whether or not they can censor certain books.
L:  Right.
R:  Right.  And this is in public or private school?
L:  Public or private.  Right.
R:  Um, I definitely think so in public schools, because I pay my taxes [LAUGH] and there's a lot of stuff out there that I think needs to be censored from children because I don't think that ah -- that it's the place for -- for children to be introduced to certain things.  I think certain things like that should be done at home with parents, ah, you know, I mean, it -- going along --
L:  Well, it -- it depends on -- on what -- what kind of censor -- what kind of books are you talking about censoring?
R:  I guess I'm going right down thinking of of moral iss- issues, right off the bat.  That's probably my -- my first thought.
L:  You mean, things like sex education?
R:  Right.  Right.  Um, just that I think --
L:  With sexual explicit books?
R:  Exactly.  Yeah.  I would think that --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- those definitely should be censored and if I were paying for tuition to a private school for my child, I would certainly hope to have some input into what they were, you know, presenting also.
L:  Well, I -- I understand your point, certainly, you don't want a third grader reading, "The Tropic of Cancer" ... because that's a pretty sexually explicit book, um, but [SIGH] I -- I do have a problem with censorship, um, although I -- I agree that I don't want very young children um who don't understand what anything is about to just be able to pick up any book they want, but my only fear there is that how far do they carry things?
R:  Right.  Well, because there's -- there's so many other topics beyond the sexual one.  I guess that just jumps to my mind right away.  I raised five kids and I just kind of ah always had a tough time with things that they were introduced to by other people [LAUGH] and had --
L:  Well --
R:  -- to deal with afterwards, but um --
L:  Well, u- unfortunately, um, you turn on the television and even on the regular broadcast channels there's all kinds of stuff that's readily available right there in the middle of the day, early morning, you turn on any of the soaps at ten o'clock in the morning and your jaw will drop --
R:  Yes.  Yes.  For sure.  I -- I agree with that.  And I'm -- I'm very glad that I'm not r- raising kids now [LAUGH].
L:  Well, my -- my daughter is and it's -- it's a tough call --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it really is a tough call.  I -- I -- see, the problem is, I really believe that the parents are the ones that should be sitting down to explaining to the kids, "Look, you're going to come across X, Y or Z on television, in the movies, ah, in a magazine" I mean, you can't raise a child in a bubble.
R:  Right.
L:  Okay?  You can't do that.  So, you have to create an environment where the child understands certain things are not appropriate for them at this stage in their life.
R:  Right.  What are your feelings on censorship of -- of certain books, like oh [SIGH] oh, what were the ones that were burned back -- I'm thinking of an old Waltons episode and all where they would burn all the books on, oh, Nazis and --
L:  Evolution?
R:  -- and -- well, yeah, evolution, that's a good one, right.
L:  Right.  Well, I am certainly against that.  I am absolutely against that, that kind of censorship.  If you um have a particular religious leaning and your particular ah church does not believe in what they're teaching in school, I don't think that gives you the right to keep every child from that.  What you have to do is explain to the child, "This is what they teach you in public school, but we don't believe that" --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then the child, as they get older, is going to have to struggle with, "Well, am I -- what am I going to accept?".
R:  Right.  Right.  I um --
L:  B --
R:  I think about --
L:  Because I -- I --
R:  Just the thought of burning any book I guess really bothers me [LAUGH].
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  You know, it's just ah --
L:  Right.  You know --
R:  It's --
L:  There's [LAUGH] we live in a wor- in this world of information, you can't keep things for anybody because if somebody somewhere finds it, it's going to get into everybody's hands.  Okay?  The -- the -- the trick is that the home has to be the place where kids learn, "Well, these things are okay and these things are not okay".
R:  Correct.  Well, I ah I agree with you on that much.
L:  Right.
R:  I just ah --
L:  You know, because you don't, neither you nor I have the right to say to someone else, "Well, your child can't read this, see this, whatever, because I don't want my child to do that" I have to impose my values on my children and you have to impose your values on your children and we have to respect each other's right to do that.  A- --
R:  But then the problem is that you don't find a common ground and you take a p- parents, bunch of different people coming from different backgrounds, different oh economic situations or, you know, moral standings and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and you're putting them all in the same place and some think it's okay and others don't and -- and there's, you know, there's your problem.  So --
L:  Well, but [LAUGH] a public school is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- governed by the -- the constitution, since it's paid for by public funds, even though it's tax dollars, it's still public funds.  And the constitution does not approve of censorship, if you see any of the Supreme Court decisions, they do not approve of censorship.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  Short of ah being in a crowded place and yelling, "Fire" you can say pretty much anything that you want, you know, because if you're going to start censoring then, well, okay, um, I happen to be Jewish and I certainly would not like to have a skinhead going around spouting things, but I understand that they have the right to do that, whether I like it or not, because this is a free country.
R:  Mm.
L:  This is a free country and I have -- my responsibility is to tell my children, "Look, I understand that they believe in that, but that is not acceptable.  That is not the way that responsible people behave.  That is not the way that humane people behave."
R:  Mhm.  I ah -- I definitely, when I get -- when I get thinking about certain subjects, I can realize that I probably am very judgmental and I'm pretty -- probably pretty hard lined about a few things and I try and tell myself to open my mind up more and [LAUGH] it's pretty tough.  I guess -- and that comes from the way you're -- the way I was raised by the ah, you know, the strict, staunch father that ah -- the mother who, God bless her soul, would um [LIPSMACK] you know --
L:  Was open minded and your fa- your fa- --
R:  Open minded to anyone and, you know, a Christian doesn't hate, you know, I mean just --
L:  Right.
R:  -- just to say the word "hate" was my, you know, my mother said, "No, Christians don't hate" --
L:  Well --
R:  -- and you know, --
L:  -- neither do Jews [LAUGH].
R:  -- and my -- [LAUGH] and my father --
L:  That's what my -- I once -- yeah
R:  Right.  And my father just was, you know, he just had his beliefs and -- and in, you know --
L:  Well, I -- I once --
R:  -- just voiced them all the time.
L:  Right.  I once said the wor- I was a kid, I was a teenager and I said, "Well, I hate" I don't remember who it was that I hate and he sat me down and he said, "Well, listen, dear".  Now, my father came from the other side and if anyone had reason to hate, it would have been him because he was definitely discriminated against and punished and suffered because he was Jewish and he grew up in Poland --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so, he knew anti Semitism first hand, he had scars on his feet from running across the ice because his Polish neighbors turned them in when the Germans were coming during the first -- before the first world war.  But when I said the word "hate" he said, "N- n- n-, that is not acceptable --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- we are all united because we are all born to die --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- and that makes us all the same, because we all have that to bear.  So, you do not hate anybody.  You don't like what they do, stay away from them --"
R:  Right.
L:  "-- but you don't hate.  That is absolutely not allowed, not acceptable in our house."  So, I had to learn to --
R:  He seems much more open minded than my father [LAUGH].
L:  And, you know, and my father was -- he was older, he was Eastern European, um, and you know, you -- you had to behave a certain way, but you just -- you don't, you do not hate other human beings because they're different than you, they look different, they go to a different ah religious institution, they believe differently, they dress differently.  No, no.  That is not allowed.  There is a -- this is God's world and there's place in God's world for everyone.
R:  Mhm.  I'm wondering if we're swaying from their topic or not.  That gets confusing to me [LAUGH].
L:  Well, but it does --
R:  But --
L:  -- it does go, you know, fit in with censorship because [MN] they want to censor everything, you know, um, I remember when I sp- --
R:  Well, a lot of things that are censored would be based -- would -- would -- root themselves somehow in religion.
