L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hi, I'm Vicky and I haven't done this before so --
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  -- I'm real new at this.
L:  [LAUGH] Same here.  My name's Catherine. [NOISE] 
R:  Oh hey.  Hi, Catherine.
L:  [SIGH] [NOISE] So the topic is censorship in schools and books?
R:  I -- I guess it was censorship --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- in schools but it sounded like -- I am not sure if it said that --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  --could they like avoid reading certain books or --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- should they obligate people to read certain books?  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I didn't hear it real clearly.
L:  Okay.  Maybe we should do both.
R:  We could do both either way.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] First of all I guess the first question is -- is whether you have kids or not --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- 'cause I guess that might make [LAUGH] your -- a --
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  -- difference in your opinion on -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- on books in school and such but --
L:  I don't.
R:  Okay.  I'm working on my first so --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- so I'm uh twenty three weeks pregnant so --
L:  Oh, congratulations.
R:  -- but I don't -- but I don't have --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- any actually in school yet --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- um 
L:  Um, you want to do, "Requiring books in school"?
R:  Sure, since that's what I think they said.
L:  Okay.  Um, I --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- don't have a problem with them requiring certain reading, I guess.  
R:  [LIPSMACK] [MN] 
L:  Well -- ah, I guess there could be a problem if there's s- something objectionable in the reading.
R:  What sorts of things might you find objectionable?
L:  [SIGH] I don't know. [LAUGH] I -- I'm trying to put my feet in if I did have a kid and I was trying to [SIGH] watch out what they -- watch [NOISE] out for what they watched --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- on TV and the movies as well as what they read but [PAUSE] [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I guess my biggest problem would be the school telling them or not allowing them to read certain things.
R:  Right.  I mean certainly --
L:  Or not having them available.
R:  Right.  I mean certainly, as far as required reading goes, I don't know, I brought up -- I was brought up with it.  I assume you were brought up with it too.
L:  Yes.
R:  Certainly are certain pieces of classic literature that are [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- sort of core teaching pieces I guess that I -- I think are pretty important.  I think the real question --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- really has to do with -- more --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- with whether you know, how the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- critical process of thinking --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- about books --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- is than really what the --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- material is.  I think you can probably teach --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- critical process you know, whether you're pulling some --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- piece of pop trash --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- out or whether you're, you know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- pulling Shakespeare out or whatever it is --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's really a lot more about [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- critical thinking than about exactly what the nature of --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the material is.
L:  [LIPSMACK] And it can be a discussion topic for the family too. [NOISE]  
R:  Right.  I would think so.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I would think so.
L:  But no, I -- I guess I don't have a problem with requiring certain things --
R:  Right.  I mean certainly --
L:  -- by the school. [NOISE] 
R:  -- if it comes to the point where -- where -- [NOISE] the --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- required reading is getting to the point where it's not allowing you a lot of time to read --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- anything else, that's --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- certainly a problem.  Or certainly --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- if -- if you have --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- reading lists that are obviously pushing a --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- certain you know, agenda of --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- some sort.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  But --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I don't know.  Um, maybe the question you think you heard, and I'm not sure which it was, is more interesting.  Which was more --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- about -- about sort of censorship --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- of books and I'm not sure how hard you censor things except -- I guess if you pulled them out of the library so whatever --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- since that's where I guess a lot of the [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- kids do -- although I [NOISE] would expect most -- most kids sort of supplement with public --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- libraries sort of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- thing, rather than just school system stuff but --
L:  If their parents read --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and if their parents encourage them to read.
R:  I guess so.  I mean I guess it's -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it's an interesting question to me because I don't expect to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- have my kids get their main choices of what they read strictly from the school system so I'm --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- probably not --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- nearly as worried about it as somebody who thinks that --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- basically all their kid's gonna read is whatever the school system is [LAUGH] throwing at them.
L:  That's very true.
R:  But 
L:  [NOISE] The parents are being involved in their student's edu- -- in their child's education then. 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  They'll supplement it and -- 
R:  [NOISE] Right --
L:  -- yeah.
R:  -- and part of it, I think, it's kind of -- it's kind of neat especially when you get into the classic stuff kids read; sort of what you read --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- growing up.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] I mean --
L:  Back to, "Requiring --"
R:  I'm -- I'm generally anti -- I'm generally anti censorship but I'm not actually --
L:  I am too.
R:  -- you know, generally I think, in terms of school systems making choices of -- I mean, certainly reading specific --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- text needs to be part of curricula --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- so there's obviously going to be made -- some --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- choices getting made there, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know.  Not sure really --
L:  And I think to be well rounded and to [NOISE] know -- I don't know, what's the word I want? -- [NOISE] on the same footing as the rest who are educated then, yeah, there are certain books that should be required.
R:  [NOISE] Right.  I mean it -- it's -- it's --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- funny even to the point of stuff that's not -- not primary because to -- you know to that individual 'cause it's primary to culture.  I mean for example -- I mean, I'm not Christian but I can understand most of Western literature a lot better for having read chunks of the --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- Bible.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- because there's so much that's based on that and you know, similarly --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- for any of the sort of [NOISE] core documents that have sort of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- changed how people have thought in the last you know, however many years.
L:  [NOISE] Or you hear a random quote from Shakespeare and you can go -- you -- you know where it came from.
R:  Mhm.  And -- and a little more context and that's at -- at --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the very least culturally interesting and, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Makes for -- 
L:  Be culturally literate.
R:  -- makes for well rounded people I think, so  you know I -- I -- I mean actually I'm in favor of there being sort of core curricula that people growing up in America at least are sort of [SIGH] -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- things that it's likely that [MN] they're -- that they're likely to be familiar with.  Uh, you know I'm certainly in favor of people continually reviewing that and putting in new ideas and things that are coming up new and new changes in terms of --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- new things that are coming in --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that are interesting but --
L:  [NOISE] I agree with that.  [MN]
R:  -- but I -- I hope people keep reading Shakespeare.  I mean --
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Yes.
R:  -- [LAUGH] I really do you know.
L:  [NOISE] Goodness.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] I hope he is but --
R:  I think --
L:  Go ahead.
R:  [MN] Sounds like something interesting going on in the background there. [MN] 
L:  Oh, that was an airplane.
R:  Ah, okay.
L:  [NOISE] I have to sit outside to get a good signal. [NOISE] 
R:  Oh okay.  I hope you can --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- hear me sort of okay.  I'm in my kitchen [MN] the ah -- [NOISE] 
L:  You're fine -- you're fine.
R:  -- connection's not always that great here but [NOISE] it seems to be being okay right now.
L:  [NOISE] Okay.
R:  We mostly agree so I -- I -- I guess it's hard to have a longer conversation on this one. [NOISE] 
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] Um.
R:  I think they mostly just want to listen to people talk --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- in any case but --
L:  Really? [NOISE] 
R:  -- it probably doesn't actually matter that much.  I think they're probably just giving something to people to get them started so that they're not like, [SIGH] "Hey, I don't know you.  I have no idea what to say to you". [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [SIGH] I guess.  I don't know.  I don't know, maybe they're doing opinion polling.  I don't --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- really know a lot about this uh --
L:  [NOISE] I reread The Great Gatsby about six months ago.
R:  Oh yeah?
L:  And I guess I first read it in tenth, no eleventh grade.
R:  Okay.
L:  And I think I missed most of it in eleventh grade 'cause I was waiting for them to kiss and that's all that mattered because I was full of hormones and that's all that matters in eleventh grade [SIGH] and --
R:  That is an interesting --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- point, to go back to something. [LAUGH] 
L:  I reread it with a book club and I got a lot more out of it.  Well, not -- I don't know that I got stuff out of it but it -- there is more of a story there.
R:  Mhm.  Than the kissing part.
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] Yeah and him yearning for Daisy. [NOISE] 
R:  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  So that was neat.
R:  [MN] 
L:  Oh there's a squirrel running across the yard with a full tomato.
R:  Oh my goodness.
L:  Full grown tomato.  That is amazing.
R:  Wow.  Do you grow them?  Is it stealing it?
L:  My neighbor is.
R:  Ahah.  Mhm.
L:  So, it's stealing it from the neighbor.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh my goodness.
L:  Jeez.
R:  Well, that's actually very interesting.  I remember reading [MN] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- basically about the time when --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I was, I don't know, I'm guessing --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- ten --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- eleven --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and very avidly into reading everything and reading the whole um C.S. Lewis Narnia series --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- which I don't know if you're --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- familiar with.
L:  Yes.
R:  Having been brought up Jewish [NOISE] I'm missing the whole allegory entirely.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  And then reading it again to some other kids when I was a camp counselor at age [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- sixteen or so --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  -- and being really offended by it because I was like, "Wait a minute, this is a Christian book.  They tricked me" [SIGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] It is.
R:  -- and --
L:  Very much so.
R:  -- I really -- at this point I'm actually looking forward --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- to in -- I suspect in the next --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- some number of years at least, going back to it as an adult [NOISE] where I can sort of look at that as part of the context but also sort of see the fantasy [NOISE] background --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- on it and hopefully be --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- less offended, [LAUGH] I think. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yes.  It's still a great story.
R:  While still -- while still recognizing [NOISE] you know that -- that definitely was -- was Lewis's, you know, background at the time he was wr- writing that.  He had really just gone through a fairly serious religious epiphany and was putting that ya know into -- into his fantasy stuff.
L:  [NOISE] And they're still good stories.
R:  Oh, they're absolutely good stories.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I'm still thinking about that squirrel with the tomato you mentioned.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know it's not really relevant to -- to literature --
L:  He's disappeared.
R:  -- and children and everything but [NOISE] 
L:  And Aslan can be seen as --
R:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- not just a Christ figure but as a superior god figure in --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- the Narnia stories. [NOISE] Yeah.  I don't know -- as he leads the children just kind of [NOISE] -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- in the other books, not just The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Oh, [NOISE] there's um  talking --
R:  Oh yeah, I mean I think it's -- it's funny 'cause to me it sort of strikes me the same way [NOISE] that you were saying with The Great Gatsby with the kissing.  [SIGH] Once you're in a certain --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- place, you know, it -- it's gonna be, you know, when you have a hammer everything looks like a nail.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Certainly if you're got an agenda -- if you're looking for agendas and stuff [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- you're gonna find them.
L:  -- that's very true.  That's very true.
R:  Yeah.  And I know -- I don't know how much people who sort of design high school curricula --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- do, you know intentionally say, "Well, you know [LIPSMACK] kids are going to read this -- this piece of literature that has a lot in it but yeah, it's got some sex in it and that's what they're going to be reading for" --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and you know how much they're explicit or --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- implicit about -- [NOISE] about that, especially choosing new curricula --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I'm not really sure.
L:  It's good to be acquainted with them somewhat though.  Even if the kids don't get it all.
R:  Yeah.
L:  At least they've at least touched on it and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- can look back and go, "Oh yeah.  I read that.  What was that about?" and maybe pick it up again one day. [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Fine.
R:  I -- I feel like some times I should pick up more of the classic literature than I have lately but --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- [NOISE] relook at some of that stuff.
L:  There's so much out there to read.
R:  There is.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  There's a lot to read and a lot to watch and everybody's busy.
L:  [NOISE]
