R:  Hi, I'm Eugene.
L:  Hi, I'm B.J.
R:  B.J. Hey, how are you?
L:  Fine, how're you doing?
R:  I'm all right.  Um, so I guess we're talking about censorship today?
L:  What was the topic?  About --
R:  Yeah, what the -- whether the public schools should allow censorship of certain books or whether they should, uh, limit students from reading certain books.
L:  I -- I think that they should.  You know --
R:  I'm sorry --
L:  -- depending on what book it is and, you know, what school it is.  You know, if it's a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- elementary grades, definitely.
R:  Right.  Some [several inaudible words] not be around at that stage but --
L:  Rather than what?
R:  Yeah.  I know I think that the parents should have, uh, input into that though.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  It shouldn't be entirely on the school level that the decision is made.
L:  Yeah, the parents should have a say so I -- I think.  I -- I have a daughter.  She is seven months old so I haven't been through the school yet and she's gonna go to a public school I'm sure --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- so I don't know that we would have to go through that.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know.  I mean, from what I saw in public schools they really -- depends on the teacher.  You might just think that, you know, you would sit there and censor --
L:  Yeah, I'm sure the teachers will have a -- their opinions on the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- censorship too.
R:  I'm just wondering how they're gonna enforce it.  I mean, what's gonna happen if, you know, a certain teacher decides to read a certain book to the children and then --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like how -- how has the final say?  The parents would say you're not allowed or the principal or the Board of Ed.
L:  I -- I think that it could be more of a mutual decision from -- between the parents and the teachers.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  That's probably true.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean another -- another thing is at which point the students decide that's all.  I mean, they reach -- like at their age of fourteen, fifteen, sixteen -- I mean they'll have to have an input as well.
L:  Once they get older, they're more mature for the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- books, the older books.
R:  Yeah, I think it's gonna be hard.
L:  Yes.  This is my first, uh, call.
R:  Yeah, me too [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But I think we have to talk for ten minutes about this.
L:  Yeah, that's, uh, kind of a hard topic.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It just depends on what the book is really.
R:  Yeah, and I mean do you censor political issues or just sexual issues or violence?
L:  Right.  It depends on what the issue is.
R: Right.  I mean --
L:  It depends on the topic of the book.
R:  At some point politic issues -- I mean, students at some point should have a decision making --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I guess I would agree that some degree of censorship is required or a limitation placed.
L:  Right, and -- and the students should have a say so on it.
R:  I'm just wonder what -- what happen to a student who is found with a book that is not allowed by the school?  Are they gonna confiscate it [LAUGH]?
L:  Yeah, I mean if it is so -- so you know they're gonna wonder, you know, why is this censored and -- and it's not like they can't find the book somewhere else to --
R:  Ex- exactly.  Exactly.
L:  -- to see what's in it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't -- I haven't really thought about that topic a whole lot.
R:  Yeah, yeah, neither have I and I kinda went along with [inaudible] 'cause, uh, you know --
L:  Do you have any children?
R:  No, no, not yet [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Oh.  But I guess I'm not really opposed to it.  I mean, to some small degree they should have a censorship.
R:  Right.  I mean, something that's violent, that's not [inaudible] you won't want to --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like you won't want a Hitler's book read.  I mean, I wouldn't want that read at school.
L:  Or the sexual content.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Definitely don't want them reading a whole lot of that.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I mean, they're gonna be faced with it eventually but [MN] --
R:  [MN] I mean with the TV and everything, I mean, there's censorship there but children don't probably have access to many things that they might have wanted to.  Do you think we're halfway through yet [LAUGH]?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] This is --
L:  Oh, I don't know.
R:  Yeah, what else?  Censorship.  Should we have or should we not?  I mean it's kinda goes with the first amendment whether -- at which stage do people have a right to read and, you know, have their thoughts expressed because in a way it -- you're working with children's rights and --
L:  Right, it's --
R:  -- [several inaudible words]
L:  -- dependent on, like you said the age group --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and what type of -- the content in it.  But I mean --
R:  I think they should -- I think they should have uniform rules for the entire United States.
L:  And --and they don't.  That's the thing, it varies from each school.
R:  Yeah, I'm sure.
L:  But I don't know a whole lot about private schools anyway so ...
R:  Actually I went to one.
L:  You went to one?
R:  Yeah, I did.  Yeah.  It was all right [LAUGH].
L:  Where are you from?
R:  I'm in New York.
L:  Okay.  Um --
R:  Where are you?
L:  I'm in Georgia.
R:  Georgia?
L:  Yeah.  I went to a public school and didn't really have any kind of censorship and stuff.  I mean -- I mean, just didn't really think about it a lot really.
R:  Yeah.  And then --
L:  You just read what they told you to read and --
R:  Exactly, and nobody --
L:  -- that was, I mean --
R:  -- explained -- nobody explained why that you're reading certain things and not others.
L:  And I mean, there was no -- nothing on the extreme end of, uh, controversial subjects.
R:  Right, right.  Yeah, but that -- I agree that they should limit and certain things shouldn't be held outside classrooms.
L:  And the parents should have a say so in it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- along with the teachers.  I -- I should have a time watch going but I only look at the clock.
R:  Oh, w- well they're gonna tell us [several inaudible words]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- gotta be ten or eight minutes.
L:  It's hard to understand what the topic was.
R:  Yeah, they kinda blur you that way.  What?
L:  I haven't thought about this topic a whole lot [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  And [several inaudible words] like many things [several inaudible words].  Many movies that have censored [inaudible]
L:  I didn't understand you.
R:  No, like I read [several inaudible words] about this topic recently and they said that books like Ulysses were censored, said like one of the classics.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [inaudible] but the worse -- [several inaudible words]
L:  Yeah.  If -- if it was more uniform [MN].
R:  People have their own opinions about what is and is not allowed.
L:  There's always going to be different opinions on it anyways.
R:  Another thing is [several inaudible words] public schools or just private schools.  If they educated in a private school I mean parents are paying for what they get.  They should --
L:  right.
R:  -- have more say.
L:  I didn't think about that aspect of it.  Yeah, so they should definitely have a say so since they are paying [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, man.
L:  I mean, they should have a say so in the public schools too but --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- I can see where they would [MN] have more of a [MN] you know, want to have more of a say in -- in the private schools.
R:  Yeah, because the administration can be more receptive to the concept.
L:  Right.  So, in the public school -- uh, the private school that you went to did they have a censorship on the books?
R:  Um, I really don't know [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, I mean --
L:  You didn't pay too much -- just went with the flow.
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  I see you really didn't pay much attention to it.
R:  Well, I mean, it's not like anybody said that oh, we're not reading this book because it's not allowed.  Not like -- I don't -- I haven't heard of any teachers get into trouble for, you know, people reading certain books and I know that different teachers like they made their own curriculum in a way --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that they followed, general curriculum [several inaudible words] books like they would throw in about their personal interests but I mean it's not like I -- I haven't read anything, you know, really perverse in school.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I don't know [several inaudible words] and I guess I mean that should extend to college or people mature enough that make the decisions at college.
L:  Right.
R:  Eighteen, nineteen year olds.
L:  Yeah, the higher education -- the -- those schools I mean, they're mature enough for the -- you know, the other -- other books.
R:  Yeah.
