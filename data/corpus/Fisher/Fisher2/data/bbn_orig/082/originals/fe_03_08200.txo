R:  Rhonda.
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  This is Maggie.
R:  This is Rhonda.
L:  Hi Rhonda.
R:  Hi.
L:  So, ah, what's the to- um, whether or not schools have the right to force certain books into the curriculum?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.
R:  Tough one.
L:  Hm.  I guess it depends.  Um --
R:  I was thinking maybe it depends on what the -- the books was that they was reading --
L:  Right.  I guess like evolution and religion are touchy subjects with that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um -- I don't know.  I think they do.  Just certain ah I mean as long as they're like not offensive or, you know, kind of demanding people to take a certain opinion on something, you know?
R:  Yeah.  That's what I was thinking.
L:  Um --
R:  And then the religious is some schools they try to [NOISE] put prayers in the schools and something and then everybody objects and --
L:  Right.  Yeah, well, that's unconstitutional.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So -- but I mean, I think there are certain books that are, you know, mandatory for, y- well --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I mean, it seems like everyone should read --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, certain Shakespeare books or like the Great Gatsby or something, just really, you know, essential books if you ever want to like have the option of, you know, pursuing literary career.
R:  Yeah.  Particular books should be an option, but then some books sh- and some books should be mandatory [NOISE]
L:  Right.  And I guess it like varies from -- w- where are you from?
R:  Florida.
L:  Florida?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I'm from New York like I think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in New York there are certain -- there are reading materials that ah you know might be considered overly sexual in other schools but aren't really here in a lot of our schools or something.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] When I was in high school in Michigan we couldn't read nothing like Shakespeare and also we couldn't read none of that.
L:  How come?
R:  I don't know.  They wouldn't tell us, it just had to be the mandatory books that they give you.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  What books were the mandatory ones?
R:  Like Charlotte's Web and things like that.
L:  You read Charlotte's Web in high school?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] For reading class.
L:  Whoa.
R:  As part of our English class.
L:  What grade?
R:  What, like eleventh, tenth eleventh.
L:  Wow.  Yeah, my high school was completely like started Shakespeare in middle school and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we read a lot of Shakespeare, you know, read Virginia Wolfe, Tony Morrison --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um James Joyce -- it was completely different curriculum and a lot of the material was, you know, could be considered offensive or overly sexual but like that was the point, you know, to open your mind to it so it's not like so shocking later.  I don't know.
R:  In a lot of books now they talk about murder and stuff like that and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they shouldn't have that in the schools.
L:  Right.  In seventh grade we read -- have you ever heard of Catcher in the Rye?
R:  Yeah.  I had to read that.
L:  You know, we read that in like seventh grade, but it used to be banned in, you know, most schools I think, in for high school and stuff.  So, you didn't read the -- what else did you read in high school?
R:  Um, we read ah Shakespeare back in ninth grade and that's all I can remember.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  We didn't read very many.
L:  What Shakespeare -- which Shakespeare?
R:  Oh, I don't remember which one.  It's been a while.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Romeo and Juliet or Hamlet or --
R:  No, we had to read Hamlet once.
L:  Hamlet?  Me too.
R:  Yeah.  We didn't get to read --
L:  It's a good one.
R:  -- Romeo and Juliet.
L:  R- because it was too sexual or violent or something?
R:  I don't know, up there they really don't tell you why they won't --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- let you do something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They just --
L:  Now my -- my school had a lot of freedom about that, like they would even consult us, sometimes we would vote on it --
R:  Well, that would be good.
L:  Yeah.  I think that's the best way to go, but --
R:  Yeah.  To see who all's interested before they start.
L:  Right.  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.  To make sure they have enough people before starting something they don't have no one for.
L:  Right.  Yeah, this is true.  And also like I mean I guess there maybe are some books that should be read everywhere so, you know, there's like less separa- separation between different people in different parts of the country, but it shouldn't be like one reading list that's absolutely set, there should be, you know, some books that everyone reads but then a lot of, you know, independence based on schools or faculties.
R:  Yeah.  Because boys don't want to be caught reading romance books in school.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  That's true.  I don't know.  Romance books like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- crappy thriller romance books shouldn't really be read in schools anyway, I don't think.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They're kinda --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- limited, I don't know, sort of like the same way -- I wouldn't expect to read like ah sci fi medical thriller in school either --
R:  [NOISE]  No, not until you get to college and you need to.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH] I don't know [LAUGH] but ah yeah, evolution and religion definitely are t- -- I think they should both, like I think people --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- should know about both evolution and religion --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you can't just teach one --
R:  Yeah.  And you need to know both.
L:  Yeah.  I think like it's really hard because there are some schools that are still like absolutely only want to teach, you know, religion and the seven day theory --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and then there are other schools that are really progressive that will, you know, talk about religion but in kind of a mocking way or w- -- my school was less for religion and more for evolution, but tried to be respectful of both things, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  What about your high school?
R:  We didn't -- they didn't do nothing.  They didn't mention religion at all, it was like not allowed.
L:  What wasn't?
R:  The religion stuff.
L:  You couldn't mention religion in your school?
R:  You couldn't talk about it and you couldn't have no prayer groups, you couldn't have no little groups --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that meet outside the school or nothing.
L:  Right.  Yeah, they don't want to -- they don't want you to have --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- probably -- I think it -- banning religion from school kind of defeats the purpose because it's unconstitutional I guess to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- teach one religion over another or like hold prayers just for one religion but it shouldn't be to just talk about religion because then you're sort of, I don't know, promoting atheism, I guess.
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah --
L:  Or --
R:  -- there's this one guy who um took his bible everywhere he -- he went and he got expelled from the school, he had to go to a different school.
L:  For carrying his bible?
R:  Yeah.  They --
L:  Y- --
R:  -- told him not to bring it to school and he said he carries it everywhere he goes, inside, outside buildings and everything and he got expelled and had to go to a different school.
L:  That's your d- that like violates freedom of expression.
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's [inaudible] --
R:  They thought it would cause problems around the school if he carried his bible.
L:  What was it called?
R:  They thought that it would cause problems around the school if he carried his bible.
L:  Oh, maybe.  I don't know.  That's still pretty horrible that they would do that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean because it just like it's one k- I mean, I guess kids aren't allowed to pray now, but they shouldn't be oppressed, you know, if they have a religion.
R:  He -- yeah, if you can keep it in your backpack, you could probably -- it'd probably be safe to carry it.
L:  Right.  I guess it was a statement for him to carry it, like to display what he was carrying.
R:  I don't know.  [NOISE]
L:  My school was nothing like that, like you could pretty much do whatever you wanted.  I went to a very like liberal artsy school in New York.
R:  Well, that's good.
L:  M- -- my -- I mean, I guess there were certain things you couldn't do, we didn't have any dress codes and there was like one hundred percent freedom of spre- freedom of speech, freedom of expression and --
R:  Oh, our school you had to have dress codes and they kids had uniforms.
L:  W- what kind of uniform, like ...?
R:  Just average khaki pants or khaki shorts or a skirt and a white button up shirt.
L:  And you couldn't like have the -- you -- the skirt had to be a certain length or something?
R:  Yeah.  To your knees or below.
L:  Oh god.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's crazy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't understand that at all [SIGH].
R:  And then when we moved down here it was all totally different, you didn't have to do nothing, you didn't have to dress no certain way, you could do whatever you wanted and --
L:  Uh-huh.  I see.  So --
R:  So, I went to like two different types of schools in one year. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Two totally different, opposite schools.
L:  Yeah.  Really.  Really.  What about like would -- i- if somebody was reading just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- did they tell you not to read books that weren't on the curriculum in school, besides the bible or ...?
R:  Yeah.  We couldn't read nothing that wasn't on the curriculum or that w- or wasn't something that h- they handed you or put on a list for you to read.
L:  So, it was really heavily censored, they wanted to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- manipulate every idea that you ...  Well, that's really ridiculous.  I think -- I think
