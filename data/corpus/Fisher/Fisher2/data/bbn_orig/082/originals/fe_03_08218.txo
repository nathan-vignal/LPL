L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, I'm Kaylene.  I live in North Carolina.
L:  [NOISE] I'm Marcia and I live in Katy, which is near Huston.
R:  Okay.  You know what, we lived in Texas.  My husband was raised in Lake Jackson.
L:  Oh, no kidding.  That's not too far from here.
R:  No, that's not too bad at all.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I know kind of where you're at --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  We're on the other side of the world from you though, right now [LAUGH].
L:  Really?  It seems like it.
R:  I did not hear the complete topic.  I know it was something about public or private schools and something to do with censorship.  Did you hear the full topic?
L:  Sh- yeah, should um public or private schools have the right to censor what the students read?  And my opinion is, no.
R:  Do you not think so?
L:  No.
R:  Why do you not think so?
L:  Because if you start um ah shutting down areas of ah different ideas --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- on the one hand you're stifling the cr- creativity of the kid.  On the other hand, you're also making it like kind of forbidden fruit.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?  It's like, "Ooh, why can't we read that book?  Let's go out and find it somewhere else" --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and instead, you know, it's just -- it's just a book and everybody has um, you know, it's sort of freedom of speech in a way --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that the author has the right to write what he wrote.
R:  And it's also who -- who ha- yeah, who would you choose to set the guidelines, because my principles will be different than yours --
L:  Exactly.
R:  However, I do think --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- ooh, there does have to be -- I know a lot of it's gray area, but I wouldn't want my child checking out something that's pornographic in nature ah --
L:  Well, how often does that show up in a school, though --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and then who's judgment again is it that it's pornographic?  I mean --
R:  Who's judgment is it, right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's gonna be the question.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah --
L:  But I kind of doubt something like that would end up in a school in the first place.
R:  I know that a while back, ah -- I taught school for ten years -- a while back, New York turned down --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a book that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- another ah -- that Oklahoma, when I was in teaching in Oklahoma, they actually adopted and allowed it as a third grade reader and it was based on my two mommies and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah --
L:  Alternate lifestyle kind of thing?
R:  -- alternate lifestyles, right --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I would think that it would be okay for that book to be available if parents wanted that, but I wouldn't think that a child should be forced to have to read that.
L:  No, but then again, what if that child meets up with someone who's a child of one of those alternative lifestyles --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they haven't had a chance to learn about it or to understand it?  They might think it's a bad thing just because mom wouldn't let them read a book about it. [NOISE]
R:  I think it's just a real gray area and I don't -- I really wouldn't know what the answer would be.  I think that there should be guidelines, but I don't know how you can say somebody should be qualified to make those guidelines.  But --
L:  That's why I go for no guidelines at all.
R:  Because my views --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- may be very different than another person's and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and just everybody's is going to be, so it's kind of hard to -- to set guidelines, but yet I would um -- I would hope that the basis of most of what we're having our children taught -- they need to have a view, a whole world view --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but yet I also believe that they need to be taught basic morality and basic um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- how to treat humanity, how to respect --
L:  But that, to me, is the job of the teacher, I mean of the parent --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, once the child reads the book and maybe has questions, or really in an ideal world parents are looking at what their kids are reading and w- studying in school --
R:  Exactly.  It's just that that doesn't happen.  There are so many parents that have no idea of what their children are learning in school and what their children are um --
L:  But that doesn't mean we should censor the kids, you know.
R:  You -- right.
L:  The kids need to be exposed and if the parents aren't taking, you know, their responsibilities seriously then you can't just keep throwing that in the hands of the school.
R:  No, the school can't do it all --
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  -- I, um, in an ideal world, the parents will, no, the same is true about, you know, television --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you can't take everything off the television.  What we do is we just block the channels that we don't want our child to watch.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, um --
L:  And if there's something you think there'd be a question on, you sit and watch it with them and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- talk to them about it at the same time.
R:  Right.  Right.  Ah, my child's only seven, so, you know, I'm viewing this from a very young standpoint, you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- there's a lot that I don't want her exposed to.  One of the little girls was over, um, neighborhood girls, the other day and there was talk about having their male cat fixed and Kristen said -- my little girl -- she said, "I don't understand" -- I walked up on the conversation -- she said, "I don't understand.  Boy cats don't have babies.  Why are you having a boy cat fixed?" so they said --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so they said, "Because he has a big part to do with it too" and she's, "Well, what is that?" and I said, "All girl, we've not covered that chapter yet" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and I'd like to cover that one with her, if you don't mind [LAUGH].
L:  What a good teacher answer. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I said, "That's -- we haven't covered that chapter, yet.  It will be covered.  But I'd like to do it." [LAUGH] I just [inaudible].
L:  My sister had the same problem with my nephew who was um, I think eleven at the time, when his best friend came over -- no, I think he was nine, he was even younger -- came over and um said, sai- ah, heard Oprah Winfrey saying something about a rape case.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And so, Ben said, "What's rape?" and the little kid, "Do you know what rape is?" and blah, blah, you know, started talking.  My sister said, "Let's talk about this a little bit later" [LAUGH] and she tri- and she goes, "Now, what do I say to a child who hasn't had any sex education at all --" 
R:  Right.
L:  "-- what this is all about?" --
R:  Right.
L:  You know?
R:  Right.
L:  Oh, man.
R:  Ah --
L:  I'm not a parent, and I -- except for poodles and I'm really glad --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It is hard [SIGH].
R:  It is hard.  And you're going to constantly second guess -- you don't want to shield your children from the world, but yet you want to somehow prepare them --
L:  Right.
R:  -- for the world --
L:  But not scare them, too.
R:  Right.  There's just a -- there's such a um fine line -- I really think that if there's no censorship that public school teachers and private school teachers need to -- they need to be trained in how to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- not that they're just taking the place of the family, but the family quite often isn't there in so many cases ah they need to be able to present all of their views in a healthy way and not just a strong biased way.
L:  Yeah, you'd hope that n- they weren't just assigning the book to be read, they were discussing it too.
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  From all angles.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And discussing the angles.  Um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, if you were doing creationism --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- vers- -- versus evolution, you know, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I would hope both would be taught --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- instead of just one.  If they were doing um homosexuality versus the um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what we consider the normal lifestyle, I would hope that both views would be discussed in a healthy way, not in a biased way.
L:  And also with an idea of like that would be a good thing for you to discuss with your parents at home tonight.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  You know?
R:  Like -- absolutely.  And I really think the schools should also let the parents know, "This is something that we ah have elected --:
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- as a reading book, as elective reading material for our child and we are just -- for the children and you're -- you feel free to read it as well --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- and discuss it with them" and ah --
L:  Well, that's a good idea.
R:  -- and the parents, you know, be involved in it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because it's really hard for any of us to -- to draw the guidelines, but on the same hand, I would -- I would not want -- I would want to be very much involved if my child was reading a book that had, you know, that was talking about masturbating being okay and all of those kind of things.  I would want to be there to guide her through her that kind of reading.
L:  Right.
R:  I would not want her to just read that and be left to --
L:  But I wouldn't --
R:  -- you know what I mean?
L:  But I wouldn't want just my neighbor to be the one making that decision, you know?
R:  True.
L:  I definitely um -- that's -- and that's the hard part, it's kind of an all or none thing.
R:  Right.
L:  And yet it's not an all or none issue.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah --
L:  So --
R:  And I tend to be more conservative.  I ah --
L:  [NOISE] And I tend to be more liberal [LAUGH] Duh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh.  As at --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and that really doesn't probably make either -- well, it doesn't make either of us right or wrong --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's just a lot of it is our -- is the life that we've lived up to now shapes a lot of our opinions --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and our -- and our views of things and I um --
L:  You see, I felt I was too sheltered from -- from the realities of everyday life.
R:  Really?  Growing up you were sheltered a lot?
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.  And -- and quite, you know, and it's not like I lived on the streets or anything, I have a very, very nice, sheltered home life, but it was my friends that taught me a lot of stuff --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, I didn't learn a lot of -- a lot of the hard cold facts of life, um, in school or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- at home.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And ah -- it felt a little bit --
R:  And do you live alone now?
L:  Yeah.  Alone.  No kids.  Hm. [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I think I know [LAUGH].
R:  How old are you, may I ask?
L:  Forty seven.  I know --
R:  Are you really?
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  You sound much younger.  And I remember thinking forty was really old --
L:  I know.
R:  -- but you know what, now that I'm knocking on it's door [LAUGH] --
L:  Fifty sounds young to me now [LAUGH].
R:  You know, at church when they have like young couples classes starting, I -- I still feel like I'm supposed to sign up [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I look at them, and I go, "They're babies" --
R:  I know.
L:  "What are they doing being married?" [LAUGH]
R:  I know [LAUGH].  I know it.
L:  Oh, perspective.  Whew, it's everything.
R:  I know.  It really, really is.  Ah --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, see, we can agree to disagree and still um we know we have the kids' welfare at heart.
R:  That's right.  I think that's the important thing.  Um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and we sh- --
L:  I think a lot -- w- --
R:  -- that all public school teachers and all private school teachers were teaching --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because they had such a heart for children and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- then these things would be non issues.
L:  I would love to have been a teacher.
R:  Ah, they would do what was best for the child --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but for so many, it's just another job.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And --
L:  [NOISE] And so many want to just go into the admin and just put in their time --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- and then, you know, make more money as an administrator, whereas, you know, and then they're not really doing anything for the kids, I don't think.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?  We have -- we had an issue
