L:  Hi, my name is Liz.
R:  Hi, I'm Christina.
L:  Hi.
R:  Um, I'm from Ohio.  I don't know if you care or want to know, or [LAUGH].
L:  Okay.  I'm from Minnesota.
R:  Okay.  Um, I actually attended a private school my whole life --
L:  Oh, you did?
R:  -- before college.  Yeah.  And I kind of don't -- like the problems they were having in school with um the pledge of allegiance and stuff like that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't see a problem with it, but I think I'm kind of biased because I attended a private school.
L:  Okay.  Did you say it every day?
R:  We did say it every day, I mean we prayed in school and everything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It was a private Catholic school.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, you know --
L:  Because I went to grade school for a private school, a Catholic too and we, you know, we said it every day and we prayed every day but, and -- but I don't think back -- see, I'm like fifty years old and ah back then it wasn't censored, nothing was -- I don't even know if books were censored that were in the library.  I really don't.
R:  I'm twenty three.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, I think just about everything these days is censored.  I mean, it's like if you say one thing you're offending somebody and I think it's getting to the point where it's ridiculous.
L:  Right.  Yes.  You don't know who's going to take offence to it.
R:  I mean, m- I don't know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I really find offence with, I mean, not saying like, you know, the problem with saying the pledge of allegiance --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I think that's ridiculous.
L:  Right.
R:  We've been saying that since I don't even know when, but it's just, you know --
L:  It's always just -- just a fact of life.
R:  -- I've -- we're American.
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  It's like we're ah infringing on other people's rights all the time.
L:  Right.
R:  What about us, we're Americans?  You know, what about our rights?  I don't know.
L:  I know.  And I -- I've never been in a school, or a situation, where I was told what book I couldn't read.  I don't know, I've never -- not at all.  I mean, I don't know if you had a list of books that you weren't allowed to read in school?
R:  Um, I do know that there are lists that are likely highly debatable ones, like teachers and school districts --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because of their content.
L:  Okay.
R:  But I don't think it was ever like -- like political or anything.  I -- I think it was mostly like, you know, just certain topics, I think.
L:  Right.  Yeah.  See, I just --
R:  But -- but it's all like essential reading that just makes you more aware of everything.
L:  Right.  You should be able to re- everything should be open so you could understand it, yeah.  Not that you're agreeing, you know, or disagreeing with what's written in the book, but just --
R:  I mean --
L:  -- that you have your chance to read it.
R:  If you watch TV every night, you're going to see murders and all kinds of stuff.
L:  Right.
R:  What is wrong with writing by, you know, qualified people that are explaining whatever situation to you?
L:  Right.  Yes.  
R:  If you grow up in a bubble, which I kind of felt like I did --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- when I -- I grew up in a -- a nice area, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then I went to college and it was a shocker.
L:  It was?
R:  [LAUGH] When I looked for my first apartment and everything like that, I just could not believe like the -- I -- I mean I grew up in a -- in a -- in a cr- white American, you know, community --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there were, you know, a cou- a couple of black kids, couple of Asian kids and that was about it.
L:  Right.
R:  When I went to college it was so hard.
L:  Was it?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You couldn't accept them, or it was --
R:  It's not that I couldn't accept them, but I viewed um I viewed everyone as being nice and friendly --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- and I was --
L:  -- and you saw a different world.  Yes.
R:  Yeah.  I didn't reali- I mean, not that, you know, people of other, you know h- 
L:  Not that they're bad, no.
R:  -- nationalities or pr- you know, yeah.  But I was just, you know --
L:  Were your parents prejudiced?
R:  My parents weren't prejudiced.  I had a black friend, I mean, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there's only a couple of black kids in my school so, I mean --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I did have a black friend [LAUGH] but um it was just when I got to college, I just saw how -- I mean, there's, you know, white people that are pretty, you know --
L:  There's both.
R:  -- off the wall too.
L:  Right.  Just as much.  Yes.
R:  But I- I was just so naive and I treated everybody, you know, I was so nice to everyone and I didn't see any bad --
L:  And it didn't come b- yeah.
R:  -- in anyone.  And then I had a bad situation happen, um, with a maintenance person in my apartment complex that happened to be black --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it just kind of opened my eyes --
L:  That gives you, yeah.  Yeah.  It does.  And it's really sad --
R:  And I put myself in positions where a lot of bad things could have happened, but because of the way that I grew I didn't know.
L:  Ah.  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  No, I just don't think they should censor books and things that kids --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- can read.  There's cer- I mean, there's I suppose a certain amount of books, there's so much written out there that, you know, anything is written nowadays.
R:  I have a -- a two year old --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and when he goes to school, I think, I mean, cer- certainly like sexual things I think --
L:  Right.
R:  -- should be, you know, censored.
L:  Right.
R:  When it comes to like, you know, telling them about, you know, their bodies and stuff like that, that's different.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, I mean, I personally don't agree with how sexual the world is these days.
L:  Right.  But it's out there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they're going to come across it sooner or later.  A bit like I have a gay friend and I -- my kids are seven and ten and, you know, I tell them right up front, you know, that um because he lives in Hawaii and stuff and, you know, they ask about him and I tell them that, you know, and then we have a couple of people in our neighborhood that are gay and I just explain to them what the difference is between them and us, you know, between her, you know, their dad and me and you know it's just like they need to know that because they're going to see it and they were already asking questions.  You know, "Why do two guys live together?" and dah, dah, dah and it's like, "Well, you know, this is the way they choose to be and there's lots of things you just have to open your eyes to" you know.
R:  Now, I don't -- I don't have a problem with gay people either --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I think these days too many younger girls that are not actually gay are doing it to be cool --
L:  Really?
R:  -- and I have a problem with that.
L:  Huh.  See, I haven't come across that, so I don't, you know, I didn't even realize that.
R:  It's probably not -- not in your age group --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but like the girls that are I would say, you know, ear- late teens, early twenties --
L:  Really?
R:  -- are doing stuff because their boyfriends are interested in that ki- -- I saw so much of that in college.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Doing stuff with other girls because their boyfriends are interested in it.  Doing it, I mean just --
L:  Just to be curious?
R:  Yeah.  And I'm sorry, but not that many people are gay.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  [LAUGH] It's like they're not --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- being themselves and they're doing stuff just because of what other people think.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  So --
L:  That is different, yeah.  Because I didn't realize that was going on.  Huh.  I mean --
R:  It just --
L:  -- true people that are gay, that's -- I can accept it, you know, it's just their way of life and as long as they don't interfere with how my life is then that doesn't bother me.
R:  I mean, yeah, I -- I wouldn't prefer to have like two gay people in front of my son, sexually experimenting in front of him --
L:  No.  No.
R:  But whatever they want to do, that's fine with me, as long [LAUGH].
L:  In their own private, right.
R:  And as long as I get to stay with my husband, that's fine.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know.  Um --
L:  Right.  Yeah.  I understand, yeah.  And my kids are in public schools and they -- not that I know of -- are things being censored, because there's one that, you know, she's going into fifth grade and my son is going into second and right now I don't see anything that's censored.  So, I can't, you know, relate.  Maybe when they get in middle school more things will -- they'll send home --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and say, "You can't read this, you can't read that" --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Oh.
R:  He just woke up from his nap.  I heard him crying. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, but -- well, they shouldn't censor anything.  I mean, unless like I said it's overly sexual, I don't know how I'd feel about my son reading a book about, you know, anything to do with sex or anything like that in school --
L:  Right.  It de- --
R:  -- especially in an elementary setting.
L:  Right.  Yeah.  Elementary, definitely not.  But I think middle school, because they are curious and they, you know, it's better for them to at least read it and then you could go over it with them and say, you know, under- explain it to them and then you'd understand the book more too.  I mean, that kind, you know, but it should be up to the parents.
R:  Yeah.  I --
L:  Not up to a school district.
R:  But I think there's so many parents that are so uninvolved with their children.
L:  Yeah, that could be a -- that the kids will -- well, the kids will read it anyway, then.  If they don't read it in school and they're curious, they're going to find it somewhere else and they'll probably read it.  So ...  But, like I said, I haven't come across any of it yet and I have two older kids that are your age, twenty three and twenty five, and nothing was ever censored back then either, in grade school.  So --
R:  Well, I did have, actually, a case in first grade, I read a version of um Little Red Riding Hood --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and at the end the wolf ate the girl --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and it normally doesn't end that way.
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] So, I went to school and I was crying and I came home -- well, I came home crying from school and I told my mom what happened [NOISE] I do believe maybe that book should have been censored --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- I was in first grade and I just, you know, when you're in first grade --
L:  You don't understand that, yeah.
R:  Right.
L:  Right.
R:  And I'm thinking, you know, the, the wolf I -- that's the only th- case I would say that should, you know, maybe a certain grade level shouldn't read certain things, I mean I think --
L:  That's -- yeah.
R:  -- if I would have been in fourth or fifth grade I would have known the wolf obviously did not eat the girl.
L:  Right.
R:  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Plus the story is just a story, it's not the truth.
L:  Right.  And nursery rhymes, some of them are very violent --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it's how people translate them and stuff, yeah.
R:   But ...  Have you done many of these calls?
L:  Um, this is probably my fourth or fifth one.
R:  Really?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I did a couple like a couple of months ago.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I got, you know, I'm doing this, you know, you're not actually going to get paid.  I actually got a check in the mail.
L:  I did too.  I got it for twenty.
R:  That's what I got mine for, too.
L:  Yeah.  I just got it the other day, I haven't even cashed it.
R:  Well, neither have I.  And then I'm thinking, and I haven't gotten a call, they called me to -- to start up a call.
L:  Oh.  Okay.
R:  And I was like, "Okay, whatever" [LAUGH].
L:  Oh.
R:  I -- I can sit here and do this all day long.  But [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.  See, I'm at work, but it doesn't --
R:  I thought it normally cut off, because it seems like it's been ten minutes --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, they said ten minutes and we got on at two forty, so it -- forty six, so
