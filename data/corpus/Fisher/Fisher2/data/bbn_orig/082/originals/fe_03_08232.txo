R:  [NOISE] 
L:  No.   Hi. 
R:  [NOISE] Hi, Tommy--
L:  Hi.
R:  -- [inaudible] here from New York.  How are you?
L:  I'm fine.  C- Courtney --
R:  Good.
L:  -- Cobalt here in Charlotte.
R:  W- Whitney in Charlotte?
L:  Courtney.
R:  Courtney?  [NOISE] 
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay.  Courtney, you got Tommy, how are ya?
L:  I'm doing great.  I'm doing great.  Yes.
R:  Okay.  If I got the, uh, theme right, public and private schools having a children referred books.  [NOISE]
L:  Yes.  Should they have the right to?  Well, what do you say?  I -- I don't think so. 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I -- I think that, uh, it's up to -- I think they should start with their training at home --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And their parents should already been and installed some things in them.  A level of -- of standard and morals that were -- they can make a -- a decent choice of themselves, you known --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- not to read certain things that would not be a blessing to them; that would not, uh, enhance their -- enhance their growth.  Uh, you know, they -- their parents should already be accustomed to a level of learning and -- and understanding of things, of what's good and what's bad so that when they choose something, they would choose something that would in other words, be a benefit to them instead of harm them.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]--
L:  So -- 
R:  Gee when I went to school --
L:  -- and the school would -- 
R:  -- our greatest thing was Tom Sawyer.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Well, a lot of parents don't read themselves.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And if your parent is not reading, it's hard to, you know follow up with kids.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But like you said, parents should be laying that groundwork before school.
L:  Yes.  Exactly.
R:  You know --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- schools shouldn't be the place where I learn my morals decisions.  You know, that's for --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- mom and dad.
L:  Yes.  Exactly.
R:  As opposed to well, you know school's going to be a test grade for all.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that -- that's the hardship --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- you know, kids --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- are looking for direction --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and my school teacher might have a different point of view then my parents want me to have at that time.
L:  That's right.
R:  Or they might be, you know, totally opposed to it.
L:  Mhm.  That's true.  That's true.  That's true but -- but what, uh, you know, uh, sometimes, you know I -- I think too that, [LIPSMACK] you know, like I said, teachers they sh- -- they may have a different point of view ad maybe than what mom and dad have --
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  -- and --
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  -- [MN] hello.
R:  [inaudible] listening to you.
L:  Okay.  Uh, and so, uh, a lot of times --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- so --  
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, keep talking.
L:  Okay.  So, uh, evidently -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- a lot of times the -- the -- the teacher does -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- have a different --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- uh, opinion of what mom and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- dad may have.  But at that time, you know --
R:  [NOISE] Yes.
L:  -- we can only hope --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and -- and trust that the children will make a wise decision.  You know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and only receive things -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- in their mind and in their spirit that is the right things.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, a lot of times, you know, uh --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I have 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- okay.
R:  Y- you have kids? 
L:  Yes.
R:  How many do you have?  I don't have any.
L:  O- okay, I have five.
R:  Oh, you are a busy person.
L:  Yes.  Yes.  So, you know, that's what I'm saying -- that's why I say well, you know, everything that the kids li- -- is just fresh come from home.  That's why I say that because, you know, I -- I went the way to -- to make sure that my kids knew.
R:  Yeah, well also --
L:  And a lot of times -- and a lot of times even being, uh, going into the school system, I've seen teachers who -- they're not some, uh, I will say project right morally things because sometimes I will look -- I will just stand back and hear the way maybe a teacher address a child.  And --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] and I know from the way they address them, that they doesn't have, oh, I would say, um, oh -- oh -- oh -- oh -- a -- 
R:  Best interest of the child at heart?
L:  -- yes.  Exactly.  So, therefore they wouldn't really have a -- a level of caring whether the --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- child reads something that is good or right for them, you know.  Just, you know, whatever, you know some --
R:  Well, you did at that point where you mentioned parents going to the school --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and that's why I got to give my dad, Freddy.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, my pop he was a social worker but he had off Sunday and Monday, just so he could come to school and make sure things were okay with me and my sister.
L:  That's what -- I did the same thing.
R:  And -- 
L:  That -- that's great.
R:  But this point also, as a parent you can speak to the teacher, "Listen, you know, our feeling on this subject is this.  So we'll handle this ourselves".
L:  That's right.  That's right.
R:  And the child's not put in a position of trying to change his -- the teacher might be just going through the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- curriculum and the kid's going, like, "No".   
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  But mom and dad have never showed up and said, "We're handling this at home --"
L:  That's right.
R:  "-- so, when this pops up you can just dismiss him.  He's not being disruptive --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- but we already did it".
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.  You know, sometimes my kids have come home and said, "You know mom, you know, uh, they was teaching us this, this and this in the book".  And I say, "Well, that -- we don't believe it but --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- the thing is this; when they're teaching it because it's in the book, that is what they are -- they have been trained to teach.  So, therefore you listen and you do the paperwork.  You do the --"
R:  Yes.
L:  "-- +curriculum, you go through and you do it according to the book.  But you know we believe this".
R:  There's something different.  Also --
L:  Yes, exactly.
R:  -- you don't want to disrupt the class [inaudible] respectful.
L:  And I tell -- and I t- -- exactly.  And not so much -- and then you don't want to call them out on this --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- because then you trying to say in front of all the other kids, "You're wrong.  My mom and dad said this".  I said --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- "No.  You respect them as a teacher".  But -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- uh, but they, you know, they can, uh, they -- they can determine whether, you know, our kids read this book or that book but they shouldn't have to.  You know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they can do that.  They can -- they can choose which books they think is better for our kids that -- for them -- for the kids to learn from.  You know, they can make -- the schools can make that choice.  You know, um, I wouldn't -- I wouldn't say want to put that whole right on them because the parents should already, you know, be on top of the kids, well, you know, this is good and this is not good, you know, and  --
R:  Well, if they both feel whatever books the kid has --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- now the kid brings home social studies; go through social studies.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Okay, this is accurate; this is not.  Because nine out of ten, the parents have lived through the social studies.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, if we're discussing, uh, unions --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, they've lived through unions.
L:  Mhm.
R:  If they're discussing the Vietnam War, okay, I've lived through that, so I have a different opinion 'cause I was there.
L:  Mhm.  Exactly.  That's good.  That's good.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  But you know we --
R:  So, that's very important to, um, the parent not only to go by and see the school, see the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- teacher, but, you know, talk with the teacher in a way that's not confronting.
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know, how I -- 
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- you know, I just like blue and you like red.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, for this book I'm going to ask my child to be excused or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- this book I have, um, a different opinion on.
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.  I want to really name a book that I really --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- don't, uh, agree with the kids learning but I don't think [several inaudible words] -- I don't think if I -- I don't know if I can really do that on here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But there's a particular book -- I just say there's a particular book that has just come out where -- he's been putting them out [inaudible] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- au- au- au- author has been putting them out.  And I don't allow my kids, uh, to read them.  I do not recommend my daughter, uh, to even, uh, read them, you know, my youngest daughter, my youngest son, I don't c- -- recommend they read them because I believe that they d- -- it's dealing with witchcraft and, uh -- uh, sorcery and I don't --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- I don't think that's -- that's a good thing.
R:  Yeah, because --
L:  So, I tell 'em don't read that stuff--
R:  L- leave that out.  Yeah.
L:  Yes.  Exactly.  Leave that out.  
R:  Well --
L:  Because you have enough things to battle with than --
R:  Adding that to the pot.
L:  -- read it -- e- exactly.  Exactly.
R:  Also, it used to be a point in time where, like, I mentioned Huckleberry Finn, was you know, a good story.  You didn't have to worry about it.
L:  Yes.  Exactly.  
R:  Um --
L:  I loved it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- the reading -- the reading story was a mystery [PAUSE] Moby Dick, you know, you didn't have to worry --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- about it.
L:  Right.
R:  It was a harmless book.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  It was a good book.  It told a story.  You didn't have to worry about, did it lean my kid toward this issue or that issue.  It was just a good story without any, uh, underlying plot.
L:  Yes.  Yes.  [MN] 
R:  [several inaudible words] anyway.  You know -- 
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- I loved Huckleberry Finn and those guys.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you know --
R:  And --
L:  -- I -- I -- I'm -- I don't know if you [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- not [several inaudible words] but I got kinda sick of them but, um, it's just like this; sometimes you get literature, a book and [MN] maybe they're trying to g- you know, they're of course trying to get to a certain point, but, um, [LIPSMACK] sometimes --
R:  [several inaudible words] point --
L:  -- you know, people can give you misleading information --
R:  Information.  Yeah.
L:  -- it's just, like, they tell the kids, now don't have sex, say no to it, which that is right.  Say no, say no.  Abstain from that -- you know --
R:  But they're filming everything else that goes with it.
L:  Exactly.  But when you've got the TV on --
R:  Mhm.
L: -- or you -- they go round and pick up a magazine that got a girl with a skimpy little skirt on -- 
R:  Right. 
L:  -- her -- she got on --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- a short top, her belly's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- showing, they said get naked now --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but you say no to sex --
R:  Well -- 
L:  -- but then when the guys see you like that --
R:  They get all excited.
L:  -- with the guys, they presuming that you're ready.
R:  Yes.  Well, see --
L:  See.
R:  -- I told my sister that 'cause she was giving the example -- if she had a daughter -- I said, "You know, if you had a daughter, tell your daughter the truth".
L:  Exactly.
R:  Don't -- don't lie -- listen -- certain age, hormones will come into play --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- so, save yourself --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- a marriage if you feel that, you know you don't want to wait any more, that's understandable, things happen --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- go to the drug store, go to [several inaudible words] don't pop out three, four kids and go I don't --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- know what happened.
L:  Mhm.
R:  'Cause I'll tell anyone, you have a kid, you're a girl, I'll forgive the first one --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, the moon was in your eyes, he told you he loved you -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but you're thirty now.  Okay
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Let's move on.
L:  Well, you know what --
R:  And --
L:  -- I'm a -- I'm going to make you laugh.  
R:  Go ahead.
L:  I'm going to make you laugh.  You know what, my daughter -- I -- I wo- -- I did not put her -- I did not put 'em on birth control, I did not give 'em that option.  What I told them, I said, "If you do it, it's going to hurt".  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah,
L:  And they -- they were, like, [several inaudible words] I said, "Oh, no" I said "Because something has to give away for that imparting into you and it hurts".  And I put the fear of God in 'em.  You know I told 'em, you know, if you do it, you know you -- you can actually, uh, ha- -- not telling me, like, you ha- -- you can have a baby and you're not ready, then you got to walk around toting this baby on your hip until this baby +begins to walk and that's a lot of extra weight.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Not only on your hip, not only in your arms, but also in your pocket because then you have to work because momma won't take care of it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know --
R:  [several inaudible words] cost money.
L:  -- and so -- that's right.  And if -- and then -- then if --
