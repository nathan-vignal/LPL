R:  [LIPSMACK] Tina. [NOISE] 
L:  Minard.
R:  [NOISE] Are we --
L:  Can we talk now?
R:  Yeah, I think so. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.
R:  What was your name again?
L:  Minard.
R:  Minard?  Okay.
L:  Yes.
R:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] Okay, so we're talking about um censorship --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and public and private schools --
L:  [MN] [NOISE] 
R:  -- restricting what --
L:  [NOISE] And do they have the right to -- what was it?  [NOISE] 
R:  -- restrict -- restrict what students read.
L:  To tell students what to read.  Well yes, I think they should.
R:  [LIPSMACK] I think so as well.  I mean --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I don't -- I don't think it should be -- you know, I don't think it should be too extreme in any sense but [SIGH] you know the- they set the curriculum so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- then it -- it's not like they're saying, "You can't bring this book" -- I don't think they should be able to say to a kid, "You can't read that book at home, at school, anywhere".
L:  Okay.
R:  But I think they should be able to you know -- they set a curriculum and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know they -- they say -- 
L:  Yeah, I -- I think they should be able to regulate --
R:  --"These are the seven books you'll read this year". [NOISE] 
L:  -- somewhat uh, because it is a private school -- [NOISE] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and of course the parents knew that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- going into the school that it -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- was a private school and they knew that they would probably have to adhere to their curriculum.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  So I would say again, I guess we both agree.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That yes, to a certain extent.
R:  I mean, I think within the sch- -- the academic part of the school, yeah, they should --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [MN] I mean all schools kind of do --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- in a sense.  You know, you don't get to just go to school and say, "I'm gonna read these four books and --"
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  "-- I don't care what the teacher assigns". 
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know, you have to read what they assign anyway.
L:  Right. 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Now, if it later becomes, I guess, a big issue with the parents or the school board, then I'm sure they --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- would have to obviously meet on this. [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] Yeah.  Yeah, because I mean I know it has come up before with, like you know, books that the schools have assigned for students --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and then the parents get upset.
L:  Right.  And we should talk on this for ten minutes?
R:  I know.  I'm --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- like, "Wow" you know?
L:  What else can you say?
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  Oh.
R:  I mean I think -- I -- I -- my background --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- has been you know, "Read whatever you want" --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and that was kind of my parents.  You know, they didn't really mind if I read things that were you know tenth grade reading level and I was in fourth grade.
L:  Okay.
R:  So --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- my attitude is, "Read anything, even if it's --"
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  "-- somewhat inappropriate for a -- for a kid" and you know, it's lost if they don't pick up and you know?  It's all mind broadening I think.
L:  Well, nowadays you'd be glad for them to read anything.
R:  Well, yeah.  I mean, at least they're reading. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yes, exactly.  Exactly.
R:  [SIGH] Yes.
L:  Oh my goodness.  What else can we say? [MN]  
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, well --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I don't know.  Do you think -- do you think there's much of a difference between the public schools or the private schools?  Do you think one of them has a better --?
L:  I do.  I -- I -- yes I do.  [NOISE] Simply because I feel, coming from a -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- private school background --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that it was more [NOISE] personalized. [NOISE] 
R:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] [MN] I --
L:  Because I -- I guess because --
R:  -- come from a public school background but that's kind of my perception.
L:  Oh okay, because --
R:  It -- it --
L:  -- I think [NOISE] coming from a Catholic background where tuition was paid --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah you had to get uh, money out of your pocket to send this child to school so the child I think was taught better, [NOISE] the classrooms weren't as large --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- and it was more than one on one.
R:  Right.
L:  Whereas in the public school system, especially now days [MN] I dunno.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If my child -- who is thirty two years old -- if he was in grammar school age and I -- I would vote [NOISE] for the teachers to have combat pay --
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  -- because these kids these days are rough.
R:  Oh they -- oh yeah.  My sister's going to become --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- a teacher right now --
L:  Oh my goodness.
R:  -- and I'm like, "Oh you're crazy". [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  It -- it -- it's rough but I -- I do think --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- ah, the parochial schools --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- do offer a better education than the public --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- school system.  Not to say -- not to say that there have not been some good people that came out of the public school system.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  We know that.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  But I -- I -- I tend to [NOISE] lean more towards the -- [NOISE] the public -- the uh private sector.
R:  Mhm.  And what about in terms of um [LIPSMACK] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know being -- them setting a curriculum of restricting?  Do you think that they -- the private school [MN] is like --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I don't know, is more [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- can better argue its case to [MN] to say, "We're going to read these six books and we're not going to touch any of these"?
L:  Yeah.  I -- I -- and I did run up to that in -- [NOISE] in -- in school, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I guess because [NOISE] it was a private school --
R:  I think with the private -- yeah 
L:  -- and they had you know, they had the approval --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- of whoever, the Pope, the bishop, whatever --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to um have whatever books in school so, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] And also with private schools it's you know, you know it's uh a Catholic school, a Jesuit --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- school, a you know, a whatever type of school it is.  You know it's got this affiliation.
L:  Right.
R:  So, you kind of expect there to be an influence from that affiliation --
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.
R:  -- more so than with a public school.  I tend to think it's --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- like well, everything should be kind of open [SIGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- open to reading.  I mean --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I don't know.  I'm -- I'm like what?  I don't know that I've ever read a book that I found --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- offensive --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- per se, you know? [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay.
R:  Like [SIGH] I can't imagine what books I'd say, "No, I don't want --"
L:  Right.
R: "-- the kids shouldn't read that".
L:  Right.  [NOISE] But there are some books that you know -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- since I don't have a child in school now -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but just recently it seemed like it was somebody from school on TV saying that they didn't want a book read or something but, I have to tend to agree with you.  If the child wants to read it, let him read it.
R:  Let them read it.  Yeah.
L:  I mean, unless it's an X-rated book or something --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know.
R:  Right.  In which case you know it's not really appropriate for kids to read --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but yeah --
L:  Right.
R:  -- chances are they're gonna get their hands on it -- 
L:  A- anyway --
R:  -- if they want it --
L:  -- exactly.
R:  -- yeah.  So I would almost --
L:  Because Sally Sue has it or Sally Sue's brother has it --
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  -- and they're going to get it anyway.
R:  And I think if there's you know, controversial or --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- potentially controversial issues in a book it's better to read it in the school --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- in that context and have a discussion about it --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- as opposed to just go read it --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- in your backyard and like titter about it.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know?
L:  Exactly.
R:  And you're like, "I don't really know what happened there but you know, i- I know this is naughty".
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah. [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE] Okay.  Well, I don't know if ten minutes is by. [LAUGH] 
R:  No.  Is this -- have you done these before?
L:  No.  This is my first one.
R:  This is my first one --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- as well, okay? [LAUGH] [SIGH] 
L:  Are we supposed to talk to each other?
R:  [LIPSMACK] I think yes.
L: [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  W- where you from?
R:  Um, I'm in New York.
L:  Oh okay, I'm in Chicago.
R:  Okay, yeah, good.
L:  Oh, all right.  And what is your background?
R:  Um [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Are we supposed to talk about that?
R:  I don't know --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- if we're supposed to talk about that.  We d- -- let's talk about -- let's not be -- let's not get in trouble so we don't --
L:  Okay, okay --
R:  -- we get more calls.  
L:  All right.
R:  We'll talk about that after -- after they give us --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- the beep.
L:  Okay, okay, okay, okay.
R:  Um.  What else can we say about schools and -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I mean I guess, [MN] you know there are issues -- there are things that -- that you know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- should be more controlled --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I guess, but I don't know.  I think you know, discuss it in the class.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But that's where it gets hard because the teachers --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, like you said, combat pay.  It's not --
L:  Oh God yes.  
R:  Are they teaching any more or --
L:  It's too many -- too many students --
R:  -- are they just managing the class?
L:  -- in these classes these days.  Yeah.  Yeah.  [LIPSMACK] That's for sure.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] Okay. [LIPSMACK] 
R:  [LIPSMACK] But I think -- just to repeat, I think kids should be able to read anything. [LAUGH] 
L:  And I agree with you wholeheartedly.
R:  Yeah.  And parents should be open about it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- 'cause -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and -- and be there to talk about these things with them.
L:  To discuss them, right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  In case [NOISE] the child has any questions.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or has any sense of -- of confusion --
R:  Right.
L:  -- about the title and the book and you know, the plot and whatever yes.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, it should be there but now days so many parents work that they don't have time to spend with their kids.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
L:  You know, reading [NOISE] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but um, it is an important factor of [NOISE] course --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that these children --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- do read, so ...
R:  Yeah.  I mean I think, you know --
L:  As far as being censored, yes, I -- I -- I -- I forgot what the topic was. [LAUGH] 
R:  Should public and private schools --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- be able to -- to censor what kids read.
L:  Yes.
R:  [SIGH] I mean -- and if they mean like, you know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- at recess or something --
L:  Right, or lunch, then we say "No" because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the child is on his own.
R:  Uh, yeah.  I mean, unless they have, like you know, a Playboy, then I'm like, "Yeah, okay" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- 'cause they're not really reading that are they? [LAUGH] No.
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH] You know they're -- I guess they're -- you know if it's -- if it's a novel of some description it's -- it's, really I think it's a private thing between the kid and its -- their parent.
L:  Exactly.
R:  If the parents want to say, "No, you can't read that" --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that's the parents' --
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  -- rule.
L:  [NOISE] Mm. [NOISE] 
R:  But [SIGH]  [LIPSMACK] and watch, [MN] how much you want to bet like everyone else who has this topic is all like, "Yes --"
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  "-- they should restrict and --"
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  "-- censor everything". [LAUGH] [SIGH] Oh. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh my goodness.  Okay.
R:  But I -- you know I -- I think, "Let 'em read".  If they're reading you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's great.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  Mm anything almost is good. [MN] You know anything is better than television, I think.
L:  Well, yeah.  And unfortunately, you know I'm -- [NOISE] I've just become [NOISE] one of those [NOISE] just a little bit into it and I shouldn't be.
R:  It's easy though --
L:  Only because I'm retired though.
R:  -- you know?  A- and all of a sudden three hours slips by.
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know that's the problem.
L:  Exactly. [NOISE] 
R:  It's just how much time you -- you 
L:  And then you -- you couldn't -- you couldn't even probably get a good sentence out of anybody who's watched television as to what they saw.
R:  Oh God, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know I turn it off and I'm like I don't -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I'd have no idea what was just on --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- you know? [LAUGH] 
L:  Exactly. [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] You know.  But I read a book and it's --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- y- I remember it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm um -- you know, it's interesting.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE] Okay.
R:  Yeah.  I dunno, I guess a lot of teachers want to censor things because they -- they feel they don't know how to handle it.
L:  Oh exactly.  Exactly.
R:  They're threatened by it.
L:  Or maybe they haven't even read the books or the material.
R:  Yeah.  Right.
L:  Well, if they haven't read it of course they can't review it with the students.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So rather than to go through all of that headache and give the teacher extra work they'll say, "Oh, no".
R:  No, just don't do it.
L:  Just don't do it.
R:  Right.
L:   Right.
R:  Or if it's a controversial topic you know -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- that they don't want to [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I don't know -- say premarital sex or something and they don't want to discuss that with these thirteen year old girls --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because you know suddenly you get into like law suit territory if you're like 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  You know, if you -- I don't -- if you're like telling kids --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- in school, you know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- "This is what you use for birth control" --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- suddenly parents get upset.
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know?
L:  Oh yeah, yeah.  Touchy subject. [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] But I still think the teachers need to be able to deal with those things --
L:  Right.
R:  -- 'cause [MN] the kids are there all day.
L:  Mhm. Hm. [NOISE] 
R:  These -- you can't avoid these things.
L:  Mhm.  [NOISE] Okay
R:  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  Let's see.  What else?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Ten minutes seems like an awful --
