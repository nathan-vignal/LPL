L:  Hi, my --
R:  Hello.
L:  Yeah, hi.
R:  Hi, this is Kerry, how are you?
L:  Okay, I'm Linda. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And, oh --
R:  [SIGH] H-
L:  -- I think all books should be censored before children read them. [LAUGH] I'm just --
R:  You think --
L:  -- kidding.
R:  -- all books should be censored?
L:  Yeah, I'm kidding.
R:  No, [LAUGH] I know.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh, they -- they, um [NOISE] -- yeah, [SIGH] that's an interesting one.  Um, [SIGH] I would have to say that [SIGH] I think some of them should be, uh --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- not censored, but, uh, certain age groups [SIGH] [NOISE] before --
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  -- they are looked at.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I worked at a middle school, so, you know, I could see where that would be --
L:  [SIGH] And -- and --
R:  -- somewhat of an issue.
L:  -- [SIGH] and what kinds of things would -- would it be for the -- the language or for the -- the things -- [SIGH] the subject?
R:  [SIGH] I would probably say more content -- uh, [MN] well --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] um, I -- [MN] language and content.  Language I don't think is as much of an issue in that age group --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, but content [SIGH] certainly, you know [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it can be misconstrued [LAUGH] or taken [SIGH] -- taken --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
R:  -- way too far. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, I remember, though -- I remember being in high school and reading [SIGH] The Odyssey and it was a bowdlerized edition and just -- it was so boring, you know the parts --
R:  Oh, yeah, no I --
L:  -- that we read --
R:  -- think high school -- I shouldn't -- I don't think you should censor anything.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
R:  I think -- and, uh, uh, you're -- i- in high school I think you're to a point where you can accept that, and you're right, it m- it takes [NOISE] complete [SIGH] -- you know, half of the book content is taken away.
L:  Right. [SIGH] 
R:  So, yeah --
L:  [SIGH] You know.
R:  -- no, I have to agree with that one. [SIGH] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] 
R:  I -- I think that it's sad that they look at things and -- and, you know, change it, [SIGH] unfortunately.
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  And then they --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- they sometimes censor things for, [NOISE] [SIGH] um, the wrong reasons.  Like, uh, not 'cause it's [SIGH] adult content, but because it's, uh, controversial or something.
R:  Right, right.
L:  [SIGH] Um, I have a friend who's writing something for a text book, [SIGH] um, [LIPSMACK] a publisher on science, and he was told that [SIGH] he couldn't write about evolution because --
R:  Oh, jeeze. [LAUGH]  
L:  -- Texas is a big market and they can't sell [MN] if it [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh really.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  In Tex- [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Oh, yeah.  September eleventh, I am a California girl and I was raise here, so --
L:  Oh, right, yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] so, I --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- it's really hard for me to --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- accept that.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  I think I would be in big trouble on some of the other states. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, yeah, well, it --
R:  [SIGH] I think I would, yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [SIGH] California's the biggest market, so that's -- so I guess they can't, you know, censor everything. [LAUGH] Maybe California --
R:  [SIGH] Now, how do they do that, though, with Texas--
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- in regards to that they have to keep religion --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- and -- and, you know, everything separate.
L:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] Well, [LIPSMACK] um, [LIPSMACK] the text -- the textbooks' publishers censor themselves. [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] So --
R:  [SIGH] Really?
L:  -- they make everything come to a lowest common denominator for all states 'cause they sell the same books around the nation, but they [SIGH] want to please the most picky [SIGH] state --
R:  Right.
L:  -- which is Texas.
R:  Sell the most books --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in other words.
L:  [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] Yeah, yes. I mean, I don't know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what they would do if they were actually, you know -- if it -- when it comes to something where other states wouldn't --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- use it at all, you know, if they're having a civil war thing and they want to --
R:  Right.
L:  -- leave out that -- that slavery existed, you know. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  That's interesting.  I have an -- an eleven year old boy and --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- um, [SIGH] he, like, is reading Edgar Allan Poe right now.
L:  Oh, wonderful.
R:  Um, and he's not very into books.  He's a gifted kid, but he's not -- [MN] he didn't use to be into reading, so I'm -- I'm just happy he's reading it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't care if it's about murder and [LAUGH] it's probably --
L:  Well, why would you care, I mean, it's --
R:  [SIGH] I --
L:  -- it's -- it's -- it's -- you know, that's what's the stuff of life and imagine --
R:  Well, uh --
L:  -- you know.
R:  -- right, and at eleven years old I think that he's bright enough to make that decision, you know --
L:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  -- that -- that you can read something and not necessarily act upon it, you know.
L:  [SIGH] Right, right.
R:  [SIGH] But that's where it --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that's where I think the only thing they should look at is content in regards to age groups. [SIGH] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  Um, but in high school, I think definitely, um, everything should be accessible [SIGH] to a certain -- you know, I mean, in regards --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to schools, I think that there's nothing that they put in schools that is that bad or going to kill anybody, it's amazing how much they, uh [SIGH] change --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- everything.  In fact, he just rented Tom and Huck.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, good.
R:  I was all excited about that too.
L:  Good, good.
R:  So, you know, and that --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- at one point in time I think they were censoring --
L:  [SIGH] Yes.
R:  -- you know, things like that too.
L:  Yeah, yeah, and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] I mean, it -- the -- the -- I heard of some ridiculous thing.  I can't remember exactly now, but I think it's usually more that it's not patriotic or something when they censor it rather than [SIGH] you know --
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, gee.
L:  -- anything else.
R:  Oh, right, right now because of the war, yes.
L:  Yeah, well, even --
R:  [SIGH] And that's wrong to because that's the whole reason we're fighting it. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] Right. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Right.
L:  [SIGH] I thought we were fighting for the right to censor. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Oh.
R:  [SIGH] I know.  Well, I -- [MN] yes, there -- I have a -- big issues with all of that.  I have a friend who's very into the whole biblical side, which -- I actually am religious, but [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, you can take the Bible and -- and change it around a million different ways to suit you, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and that's what I think is -- what I worry about is that they tend to do that with books as well [SIGH] and --
L:  [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] Right.
R:  -- say it's this or that and -- and, you know, use that one particular spot instead of looking at the whole [SIGH] entire picture of -- of what, you know --
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] 
R:  -- uh, you know, regarding Shakespeare or regarding Edgar Allan Poe or any of those, you know, I mean, you could sit there and say, "Oh, well, it's about one little thing and " --
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, well, that's just bad teaching I guess, 'cause --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- I don't know, I -- I remember -- I was a kid who loved to read, you know, and I was always, like, way ahead of my [NOISE] --
R:  M- yes, me too.
L:  -- age group an -- [SIGH] and --
R:  I used to get in trouble 'cause we had math next and I'd --
L:  Right [LAUGH] 
R:  -- sneak my book under the table.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Yeah. [SIGH] Yeah, I almost failed reading one year because we were supposed to read a bunch of books off this list and I was reading, like, three years ahead and I wouldn't read any of them. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, right, [LAUGH] that would be a problem.
L:  [SIGH] Um, [SIGH] but -- but I also remember that somehow the way they taught books in my school was so [SIGH] bad that I never wanted anything I liked to be read in school [LAUGH] because I thought it --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- would ruin it. [SIGH] 
R:  That's actually true.  Um, Shakespeare didn't interest me much at all in high school --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just because we had to read it out loud and everyone was like, "Hey, whatever". 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Um, and then I saw, b- believe it or not, on H.B.O. --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh.
R:  -- it was a little [MN] blurb like they had mad a -- basically a cartoon of Taming the Shrew.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh. [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, and, I mean, I know it sounds funny but it was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- very interesting.  It was years ago [SIGH] and I remember going, [SIGH] "Wow, that's actually really cool" and I've read some of his stuff since and went, "Okay, you know, this is very interesting".  But [SIGH] when it was in school, you're right, it was very [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- [SIGH] very boring --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and same with -- you know, I had history.  I loved history too, and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- boy, man, my history --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- teacher could have killed anyone's interest in history. [SIGH] 
L:  Right, right.  I remember I was, like, failing American history one year, and I was also reading on my own all this English history [SIGH] 'cause, you know, I could read whatever I wanted when it was --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- English history --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] and I --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- remember we were supposed to be learning about, [SIGH] um, explorers and they basically censored out [SIGH] everything that had anything to do -- that was at all interesting about --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [SIGH] the conquistadors [SIGH] and the-- all they left you with was, like, dates and places and names and they were all heroes [SIGH] and --
R:  I -- yeah.
L:  -- and it was --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- so boring because of that, and then years later, you know, I thought if they had told me that, [SIGH] you know, when they got to -- [SIGH] to Mexico City they made it burn for three days and it was a city on a lake, [SIGH] you know, then I would have remembered that. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right, [MN] you know what?  I had -- my highest -- my, um, [SIGH] senior high school teacher, it was advanced English, um, [SIGH] and she would tell us interesting facts about the authors, like, um --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- [MN] Alice in Wonderland's author being -- actually they thought he might have been a pedophile to a certain --
L:  [SIGH] Right.
R:  -- degree.
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH] Um, things like that, I -- I still remember all that way more than I ever would have remembered half of what we had to read normally --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- um, because it makes them real, makes them --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- real people and that they went through stuff, they went -- Edgar Allan Poe, him having drug problems, etcetera, [SIGH] you know --
L:  [SIGH] Right.
R:  -- I talked to my son about that and I said, "You know, [SIGH] he didn't [LAUGH] have a very good life but [SIGH] he's interesting".  Or, you know, even Van Gogh, or people -- you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it makes them interesting when you know [SIGH] about --
L:  Right.
R:  -- them as real people.
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH] Uh --
L:  And you have to -- when they're supposed to be these, you know, paragons, then they're boring. [SIGH] It's --
R:  Exactly.
L:  [SIGH] I think it's more -- I mean, it's more than just, you know, censoring, it's this idea that -- that making everything bland and boring and respectable and, [SIGH] um, [NOISE] you know, and -- and the things you can't -- making things into experts that you can't question and, you know, all of that --
R:  Right, the --
L:  -- is, like [NOISE] --
R:  -- the only problem -- the only side I would say at all there's a problem with that is that [SIGH] if you don't --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- do anything at all, then it just goes really extreme.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  That's the only thing I've seen and--
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that -- that's the -- half the TV shows and this stuff.  I mean, I have to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- even watch with my eleven year old the content on half of the, uh, radio stations --
L:  [SIGH] Oh, yeah.
R:  -- you know, in the morning, which is too bad because he of course loves, you know --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- rap music, etcetera. [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  So, yes, I -- I'm running into that a lot --
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  -- with eleven, because I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- really don't want him to be censored from everything but they almost just go --
L:  Right.
R:  -- overboard every time, too.
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH] So I guess that would be the only thing that would be an issue with censoring, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or not censoring in school --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is that [SIGH] --
L:  But that would be more like a thing of, you know, um -- that it's -- it's, like, crap. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] It's crappy and it's mean, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and -- and, um, I don't know, I guess -- I guess I -- I don't want to put my own moral standards on all. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Well, that's what I'm saying, how would you -- uh, if you --
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  -- had children writing in class, what would be the standard, though, if they chose to write about something [SIGH] --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
R:  -- like killing other people or, you know, I mean, 'cause of the whole --
