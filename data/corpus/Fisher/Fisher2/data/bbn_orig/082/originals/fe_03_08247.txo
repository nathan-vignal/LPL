L:  [NOISE] Hi, my name is Artemis Field.  I live at --
R:  [NOISE] Hi, my name is Regina Pitman.  I didn't catch who I was talking to -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- Erva Field?
L:  Oh, Artemis.
R:  Oh, Erva Ernaman.  
L:  No, no Artemis -- A --
R:  Oh, o- --
L:  A.R.T.E.M.I.S.
R:  Oh, Artemis.  I'm sorry.
L:  That's okay.
R:  Artemis.
L:  Hi, how're you doing? [LAUGH] 
R:  Hi.  I'm fine.  I'm Regina Pitman. [LAUGH] 
L:  Hi.  How are you?  Um, so our topic is um whether [SIGH] -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- whether --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um public or private schools have the right to --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- submit children to read certain books?
R:  Right. [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] To -- is that to read certain books or not to read certain books?
R:  To read them.  Whether or not they have a right to -- to censor and say, "Hey you're not --"
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  "-- you're allowed to read this or you're not allowed to read that"? 
L:  Oh.  I don't think anybody does but --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [NOISE] I mean --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I think that they should be in a library --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and -- and -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and access to but I mean --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- if that's not part of the curriculum --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- then why should they make 'em --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- read them?
R:  Right.  [NOISE] You're right.  Wait, [MN] I think the question is like whether or not they have a right to allow it even.  I guess [NOISE] with that they make [NOISE] them, but yeah that's true.  [SIGH] I -- I [NOISE] think, as far as the censorship [NOISE] goes, the [NOISE] public schools, private schools --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- whatever it is [SIGH] [NOISE] they have [NOISE] an obligation --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to censor the books to [NOISE] read -- you know, --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- to make sure [NOISE] th- -- that it's appropriate [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- material. 
L:  Um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Somewhat, yeah.  Somewhat.
R:  Yeah, yeah, I definitely do because I -- 
L:  I mean like, you know, 'course not --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- no pornography or something like that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- but I mean --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [SIGH] I think -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- well then --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- see, that's where the law comes --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I mean, that's where the fine lines are dr- -- are drawn --
R:  [NOISE]  
L:  -- you know what I mean?
R:  Right.  Yeah that's the thing.
L:  That's like how the laws come in so I go --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- "Ooh yeah, you gotta --"
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  "-- say for one, you gotta --"
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  "-- say for all".  Pornography --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- I wouldn't think --
R:  Some pornography to one person might not be pornography to the next person.
L:  Right.
R:  And see, I'll be honest, I'm -- I'm a Christian.  Born again Christian --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so I feel like the [NOISE] -- the fact that pornography is wrong [NOISE] that that has to -- that [NOISE] has to come from somewhere 'cause we can't ... like I'm just one -- like I live in [NOISE] California and who's to say -- [NOISE] I feel like who's to say that I'm right?  I'm just one person [SIGH] [NOISE] --
L:  That's exactly right.
R:  -- in the State of California compared to billions.  [NOISE] I have to have something as my basis --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- so I just --
L:  Yeah.  Y' have to have something that's right.
R:  -- choose to use the Bible. [NOISE]  I have to have something as a basis for [NOISE] my opinion --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because if I just say, "Well, that's what I [NOISE] think", you know well, I could be a -- I could be a whacko nut [NOISE] you know? [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  So I just -- I choose to um [NOISE] use the Bible as the basis for what I think [SIGH] [NOISE] you know to base it on that and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- then -- then um [NOISE] ... you know I -- I feel that schools have a -- a [NOISE] moral obligation to do it --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- because I don't feel that -- that kids left to their own devices, that they can [NOISE] do that.  That they're capable of just deciding, [NOISE] "Okay, this is appropriate for me and this isn't appropriate for me".  You know?  [NOISE] Because we as adults I feel we've lived longer.  We know what the [NOISE] longterm effects --
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] 
R:  -- are gonna be.
L:  Right.  But I mean I think they're talking more about -- I don't think that they censor pornography, and -- and besides that I mean --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- in truth we're all --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- God's children and we're all --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- intelligent beings and we're all basically good.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  We're all good and evil.
R:  Right. [NOISE] 
L:  We all have both sides.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  And if we deny one side then it comes out one way or another.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] I mean, I went to private --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- school.  I went to a Catholic school.
R:  [NOISE] Right. [NOISE] 
L:  Um and I got the best education that I was gonna get.
R:  [NOISE] Right. [NOISE] 
L:  Um I [MN] -- high school I went to --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- public school and I literally got no --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- education.  I got -- I learned how to cut --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- school. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right, right.
L:  But um -- 
R:  Right do you b- --
L:  But I still don't think that it's the state -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- state's right --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- to censor --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  --anything that I or my children read.  It's my par- -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um, it's me as a parent's right --
R:  To -- to do it yourself.
L:  -- to censor.
R:  Yeah.  And I -- that -- that's a good thing.
L:  I -- I think it was that -- I mean that's what freedom of speech is all about.
R:  [NOISE] Right.  [NOISE] Yeah, that's true.  I -- I -- I agree with that.  But I honestly [NOISE] I -- I do think that we do need -- [NOISE] we do need freedom of [NOISE] speech [SIGH] but I -- but I -- [NOISE] but I believe [NOISE] um -- I guess I'm [NOISE] what you could say like one hundred percent diff- [NOISE] that uh --
L:  You're what?
R:  -- that -- that.  I -- I said, "I guess you could say hundred percent different".  [NOISE] That actually the schools -- that -- that they do have a -- an obligation to um to --
L:  [SIGH] But to see -- 
R:  -- to censor what's on there. [NOISE] 
L:  -- what's the obligation -- the obligation that they have is to offer education and if that's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- part of education, I think the obligation lies on the parent [PAUSE] to decide what their children's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- doing and to watch what their children are doing.
R:  Oh, right, right.
L:  To be aware of it.
R:  Definitely.  And I -- and I -- God, and I wish --
L:  I don't think that the school or any public facility is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is -- has any right to my --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- children's um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [MN] uh --
R:  [NOISE] To censor what they read.  Right.
L:  -- rest of their lives.  You know what I mean?
R:  Right.  A- -- and to a certain extent I -- I agree with that except for the fact that man, unfortunately we can't be there all the time and it's so easy I think for a teacher to stick [NOISE] something in that the parents might not know about.  Just [NOISE] because of the fact that it's [SIGH] -- [NOISE] it's six or seven hours a day and -- and um the parents you know --
L:  Well, like what -- what can a -- what can a teacher stick in that -- 
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- that could be -- that could be harmful?
R:  Oh they can st- -- I -- I believe they could stick in so much.  They could stick in their belief system.  They could stick in their personal belief systems --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that could be harmful.
L:  Okay that -- that's true but I mean when they go home as kids then they know the difference.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I mean then the parents teach. 
R:  They -- they -- they should know that they shouldn't [MN] they -- 
L:  I mean the kids can stick in --
R:  -- they should know the difference but just the thing is I'm thinking of man, there's just twenty four hours in a day [NOISE] [SIGH] and if they sleep eight hours of the day I'm thinking, "Man, that leaves another sixteen hours of the day and half [NOISE] the time they're hearing one thing and they are hearing one thing that -- and another thing at home", um [LIPSMACK] yeah, what the parents say -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- hopefully we hope that [NOISE] the -- it would override what --
L:  It's not just what they say --
R:  -- what the kids -- what they're hearing at school --
L:  -- though it's how they act and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- how they example --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- for the kids to follow.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  I mean, me myself, I went to --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- Catholic school and I don't believe in --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- Catholicism and I didn't --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- when I was a child --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- because of my home life.  Because of my father.
R:  Right. [NOISE] 
L:  Because [MN] -- because --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know the uh -- for --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- myself because I saw the hypocrisy.  Even as a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- child I did.
R:  Oh. [NOISE] 
L:  So I didn't necessarily believe it --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and I still went to Catholic school.
R:  Right.  But you like, so I can tell you're like, "Forget that" and -- because of -- because of what you saw, huh?
L:  Just because of the hypocrisy.
R:  And I w- --
L:  So I mean they tried to install their --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- beliefs in me -- an- --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and sin and -- and all this --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- baloney --
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  -- about how God is not going to love you -- this and that, this and that. [SIGH] 
R:  Oh, that's a lie. [NOISE] 
L:  But --
R:  Yeah that's a lie. [NOISE] 
L:  O- of course, I mean --
R:  I'd say that -- that's -- that's [NOISE] -- you know we -- we [NOISE] do have some com- [NOISE] -- common ground in that I believe [NOISE] that what you hear and see at home [SIGH] it is definitely way, way, way more important than what at school -- that's gonna [SIGH] --
L:  Of course.
R:  -- that's gonna -- it -- it's -- 
L:  Has more of an impact. 
R:  -- it's way more important.  Oh yeah.  I -- I believe that ev- even if -- even if -- even if our kids go to school and they say, "Hey, you know what, love the Devil.  The Devil is good", you know, it doesn't matter.  And they say that -- [NOISE] they scream it at you t- -- ten hours a day, [NOISE] what they see when they get home, that's [NOISE] what's gonna make a difference.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] That's what I believe.  That's gotta override everything, 'cause I do believe that the parents have [NOISE] [SIGH] I believe parents have way more influence over their children --
L:  Right --
R:  -- that the teachers [NOISE] do.
L:  -- so I -- I -- I don't believe in censorship whatsoever.  I mean --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it starts there and where does it end?
R:  [NOISE] Right.  Right. [NOISE] 
L:  I mean it's like -- just like um [SIGH] the state --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- governing whether we can --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- smoke in our own establishments.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, that's baloney.  
R:  Right.
L:  The public doesn't have to go into that place.  They don't have to.  They can stay out.
R:  Or in your home.  I -- you know what?  I totally agree with that also in your home.  
L:  No, I mean like --
R:  The only thing is --
L:  -- or like in a bar or a public restaurant.  I mean what about the owner of that restaurant.  Maybe he wanted to own -- he wanted to run a certain type of business.  He put all his money into it --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- or she put all their money into it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and now the --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- government's saying that they can't.  [SIGH] Well, the public i- -- who's supposedly so afraid of --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- catching something -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- whoever knows what -- um, they don't have to go in there then.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  It's their choice.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  That's their freedom of choice.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  They don't have to patronize that place --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- to go -- to be exposed to whatever they think is there.  If people are so afraid of, uh, smoking or non smoking or smoking [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they can say, "Oh I -- I choose to go to a different restaurant" --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- or "I choose to go to another bar".
R:  Right.
L:  I don't think the state has any --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- right [MN] nosing in.
R:  [NOISE] As far as smoking -- yeah.  I -- I'm -- I'm --
L:  As far as anything --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- actually.
R:  I'm -- I'm glad that they have done that but I don't really think that as far as having a right ... yeah, I kinda agree with you.  They [NOISE] don't really too much have a right to do that.  I'm glad they did but [SIGH] I don't really [NOISE] think when -- as far as smoking goes because I think [NOISE] if people are going to do something [NOISE] that's to themselves.  You know what I mean?  That's what they're --
L:  Right.
R:  -- doing to themselves.
L:  Right.  And we pay for it.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  That's what they're doing to themselves so if they choose to do that then [SIGH] that should be their right.  But the only thing is I think as far as in schools, I think that doing it the way that it was done [SIGH] you know, way back when the country was founded it was working pretty good.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  You know it was work- -- it was working okay and -- and um ah I think it was real g- --
L:  What?  To separate state and religion?
R:  Ah [MN] the way -- the way that it was when -- when -- when it was censored and even now like certain things --
L:  When was it censored then?
R:  Oh, I mean --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- as far as wh- -- what was in school.  It was censored as far as what was allowed to be in school.  And even now it's still censored to a certain extent, but like you said, where do we draw that line?  Like you were saying, no um [NOISE] pornography.  You don't [NOISE] think they should be allowed to [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- just introduce pornography?  Well, my question would be --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- why don't you think --
L:  But they're talking about burning books.  It's like [SIGH] what they're talking about not allowing books of [SIGH] -- you know what they define as --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- suggestive content --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- or um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and that, which could be Huckleberry Finn which could be --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- a lot of great writers.
R:  Right.  Oh def- -- I agree wi- --
L:  And that we've never been able -- and our children never -- never had the opportunity to be exposed to g- -- to good -- 
R:  To see that kind of stuff.  Right.  
L:  -- [SIGH] to literature.  I mean --
R:  I agree hundred percent.  But the only thing that I -- I would say --
L:  -- I mean wh- --
R:  -- I would say --
L:  -- I mean why -- I just wouldn't leave my decision [SIGH] -- um I wouldn't leave any decision up to somebody --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- who's -- I don't know their upbringing --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- whoever's making this decision.  I don't know -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- maybe they --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- have some kind of um kink in their family.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Maybe they're homosexual and they don't like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- this because it veers[?] homosexual.
R:  That's true.
L:  Maybe they're -- you know, maybe they're in the closet.  I'm not going to leave my children's life and view and opportunity up to the one person's judgement.
R:  Right, right.
L:  'Cause it's not up to them. 
R:  Right.
L:  It's up to me as a parent --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- what I want my children to see and what I don't.
R:  Right.  So my only question will be that -- that as far as censorship I believe that there are certain things I would just say, [SIGH] as far as whether or not censorship should be allowed.  Obviously, you feel th- -- that they um -- they shouldn't censure but I would -- I just ask -- and I know y- -- I would just +ask well, if you feel that there's anything that should or shouldn't be allowed?  Just on a personal level, like if you were in charge and you kind of said earlier, "Hey I --" you said like, "I don't feel there should be [SIGH] pornography right there in the school.  They should be allowed to do that".  You did say that, right?
L:  Well, okay but see that would be -- 
R:  Well, how do you feel about just pornography?
L:  -- uh -- that would be -- that would be -- that would be like out of context for a school to have pornography.  You know what I mean?
R:  But see why?  But see -- w- -- w- -- see -- not to some parents.  [SIGH] 'Cause --
L:  No, but I know, but th- -- I know for a school to have pornography --
R:  Yes, but I would say, "Why?"
L:  -- would be out of context.  That wouldn't really be censorship --
R:  But I would say, "Why would y- --"
L:  That's just a decision on what they do w- -- that's -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I mean it -- it would be censorship if you told the- -- a liquor store --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they couldn't sell pornography.
R:  Right, well, I -- I would say in a school -- say for instance there's a book that talks [MN] -- say for instance there's a book that describes in -- in explicit detail [SIGH] um a -- a sexual act b- -- between -- between two men and a dog.  I would say, "Do you feel that should be allowed"? and -- but it's a book.
L:  Between --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- two men and a dog?
R:  Yeah --
L:  Wouldn't that be considered --
R:  -- it uh -- but it -scribes it expli- --
L:  -- pornography?
R:  [NOISE] Do you think that should be allowed in the [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- school?  And you probably would say, "No", right?  Even though [NOISE] you know -- you th- -- even though obviously you --
L:  No.  It would -- it would uh -- it would -- it would be -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I mean what kind of book?  Is it a literary book --?
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- or is it a magazine? 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Or -- you know what I mean?
R:  I would say take your pick.  I would say if it was either or both -- I would say if they had literary books and magazines [NOISE] and they were describing explicit sex acts --
L:  Well, that would be --
R:  -- between two men and a dog [NOISE] --
L:  -- pornography.
R:  Describe pornog- ?  I would say if it was [NOISE] two -- two men and a dog --
L:  That would be pornography completely.
R:  Y- -- yeah.
L:  Um, would -- [SIGH] I think --
R:  W- -- would you be against that? [NOISE] 
L:  I [MN] -- truthfully, if I have to be one way --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- or another I would be "No".  I would not --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- be against that because --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it's up to me to --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- decide what my --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- children read and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- what they don't.  And what they're supposed to.
R:  [NOISE] Oh no, no.  I me- -- I meant -- I meant you [NOISE] personally.  Say for instance it was just --
