L:  Hello.
R:  Mm hi, my name --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- is Rachel.
L:  Hi, I'm Stephanie.
R:  Hi, nice to meet you.
L:  Nice to meet you too.
R:  [NOISE] So, I guess we're supposed to talk about censorship?
L:  Yeah, um.  At the public and private schools, um, there should be censorship against the books they read.
R:  Um. [NOISE] 
L:  Um, my -- in my opinion, I don't think in public schools they should censor anything.
R:  Really.
L:  Yeah, um.  [LIPSMACK] Oh, [MN] maybe -ike ah, certain things but, I remember when I was a kid they tried censoring um Huckleberry Finn --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] and Tom Sawyer, and I didn't like that 'cause I enjoyed those books.
R:  Right.
L:  So  
R:  Well b- books like that shouldn't be censored.
L:  Right.  But I don't know -- I really don't understand what books they mean though now.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, I don't know what books they would teach that would need to be censored.
L:  Right.  Um. [SIGH] My daughter's in fourth grade but [NOISE] the books that she gets are fine, so  but actually, her school did try, um, banning Harry Potter.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, they did try doin' it -- she's in public school --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- but the parents got into an uproar about it and, uh, [SIGH] they decided to -- to throw it away and, you know, they didn't censor it. [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH] Banning it -- what -- as far as [MN] children allowing to have it at school, or teaching it?
L:  Um, not having it at the library.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.  At the -- at the school's library.  They didn't want to put it in.  [LIPSMACK] They said that it, uh -- some, um, of the words could scare younger children.
R:  [SIGH] What school does your daughter go to?
L:  She's in public school --
R:  In?
L:  -- in Brooklyn. 
R:  In Brooklyn, okay.
L:  [MN] Yeah.  Huh. [SIGH] So 
R:  [NOISE] That -- I went to a private school in New Jersey and nothing was censored.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, [SIGH] I went to a private school and a public school and the public school tried censoring the Huckleberry F- F- ah Finn and wanted Tom Sawyer.
R:  Mm.
L:  The private school didn't [NOISE] censor anything.
R:  Right.
L:  So  [NOISE] I just wish they would ha- told us what type of books they were talking about.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I -- [LAUGH] I must [several inaudible words]. 
L:  Probably have a better way.
R:  Like, library books or books they teach or books that kids are allowed to have? [NOISE] 
L:  Right.  I don- -- yeah, I mean, [SIGH] books th- --
R:  Like, if the kid brings Playboy to --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- school, yeah, definitely. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] You'd think so. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  With books that they teach, I mean, I have no problem with the books they use for teaching.
R:  Right.
L:  Um.
R:  [SIGH] But say, like, ah, a high school teacher is gonna teach Catcher in The Rye.  I don't think that they should censor.
L:  No, not at all.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Actually that's a c- c- -- that's a classic, you know. [SIGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Kids grow up on these books.
R:  Right.  I've heard of some schools censoring Catcher in The Rye.  I --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  I don't see -- I don't see why it would be.
L:  I had never heard of that before.  Wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, there's another one actually that I -- not that long ago.  I can't think of the name of the book.  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  Hm.
L:  They made a movie out of it too.  Oh, I can't think of his name in the movie.  Black and white movie, long time ago.  [LIPSMACK] Oh.  Oh, um, To Kill A Mocking Bird.
R:  [MN] To Kill A Mocking Bird?
L:  Yes.
R:  [MN] 
L:  Ah [SIGH] not here in New York -- oh, I think it was, like California, or somewhere like on the west coast.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  They tried banning that book.
R:  There's absolutely nothing wrong with that.
L:  I know.
R:  Like the Catch -- Catcher in the Rye you know there's a -- a hooker and ah -- but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- ah, as far as To Kill A Mocking Bird there's -- that's insane.
L:  I think because there were -- they used the N word in it.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  Yeah, I think maybe that's it.  You know, maybe [MN] somebo- -- some -- a parent may have got upset about it and [SIGH] but I don- -- I don't know if the -- I never heard what happened to that, you know.  I just heard they were trying to ban it but --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] after that I never heard anything else.
R:  [SIGH] They might ban, uh, in public schools, books with a religious undertone.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Mhm, 'cause --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- that's -- that's a big thing now.
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  Um, religion in public schools.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE] That's like [NOISE] in the -- I dunno, do you get the Daily News in New --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- Jersey?
R:  Mm mm. 
L:  Oh, it's a paper here in New York and, uh, it's a -- the editorials are just so with that almost every day.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.  Oh, no, I mean we do get a New Jersey.  I don't subscribe to it, I mean.
L:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  No, I know, 'cause I know further out in Jersey, you know, people don't get the Daily News.
R:  Right -- right.
L:  [NOISE] Um, [LIPSMACK] but yeah, the -- the religion part in public schools, I -- I think they should not do, you know, 'cause there's so many different religions these days --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so it's not fair to one religion, not the other.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  I -- I don't know.  I went to private school and it was weird because we would have -- when I was at elementary school we'd have chapel, but yet there'd be Jewish kids not going to chapel, yet.  I was wondering why they were even at the school. [LAUGH] 
L:  Ri- [SIGH] well, actually when I was in -- I was in a parochial school, a Catholic school --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- up to the fourth grade and there was a Jewish student in my school, and I couldn't -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- understand why.
R:  Yeah, it's weird.  It was a Lutheran school and there was a coup- -- there is a couple families of Jewish kids.  I just didn't understand it.
L:  Y-, uh, weird.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I dunno, [NOISE] maybe better education in private schools and there's no Jewish schools round?  Uh, I dunno.
L:  Um, here in New York there's plenty of those. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  So  but yeah.  But banning?  I mean, banning religious books in public -- public schools I can understand --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but, I dunno.  [LIPSMACK] I never -- I dunno what type of books they want us to talk about. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] [NOISE] 
L:  I wish they would have told us.
R:  Yeah.  Um. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [MN] When -- I remember ah, being in elementary school and reading certain, like, Judy Blume books --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- just like, books that we would get out of the library.  Like, we'd have library hour and then we'd be able to read, and certain books like some Judy Blume books had some pretty, um, mature --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- contents and we'd be talking about it and the teacher would be like, "What're you talking about?" --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and, [NOISE] "It's a book we're reading".
L:  [SIGH] Right, I remember those books.  You know, it's funny --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because my daughter was in second grade.  I think she brought one home and I wouldn't let her read it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  "I think you're not old enough to read those books", you know.  I think they would talk about a girl getting her first period and I was like --
R:  Yeah, exac- -- that's exactly what we were talking about.  It was that.
L:  Yeah, and, "I'm not ready to deal with that yet, you --"
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  "-- know?  That's second grade".
R:  Yeah, we were in third grade and they were like, "What'd you -- [MN] what do you mean, your period?"  Like -- [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- we were talking about it and she was like, "How'd you -- what do you know about that?" [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] And I know, like --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- la- -- actually this year, um, school she had to read Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- by Judy Blume.  I mean, that was no problem an- --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that was a good book for her read --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- but in second grade when she took -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I f- -- I forgot the name of the book.
R:  Are You There God?  It's Me, Margaret.
L:  Yeah -- It's Me, Margaret.  That's it. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah? [LAUGH] 
L:  And I was, like, "No, you're not reading this book".  [SIGH] [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I --
L:  "I don't think so". [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But I guess I -- 
R:  Judy --
L:  'Scuse me?
R:  Judy -- Judy Blume writes, ah, really good children's books but a lot of her books are --
L:  For older kids.
R:  -- young adult books.  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  And ah, this year she -- actually, [MN] my daughter read a lot.  She read Fudge and um, [LIPSMACK] ah -- ah, Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing and um --
R:  Those are good ones.
L:  -- yeah.  She really enjoyed 'em.  She actually read them a couple of times.
R:  Yeah.
L:  She enjoyed them a lot.  I'm glad got a daughter that reads a lot so 
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, that's good.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  That's good she's entertained then. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] 'Scuse me?
R:  [NOISE] [MN] That must be easy to entertain her then.
L:  Oh, yes.  [SIGH] Like now, she's reading the new Harry Potter book.
R:  Oh. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE] So she's like -- I mean, I'm glad she's into reading it --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- but she's like, well, I think she's reading --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- too much now 'cause --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- like, "It's the summer time.  Go outside, have fun".
R:  [NOISE] When I was her age I was addicted [NOISE] to [NOISE] The Baby Sitters Club books. [NOISE] 
L:  I tried getting her into that.  I couldn't get her into it.
R:  Mm.
L:  She co- -- she wouldn't go into it.  Um.  She tried a couple.  I used to -- I even tried to have a couple of Nancy Drew books.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, I used to read those too.
L:  Yeah.  You know, some I grew up on --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- but she wouldn't get into them.
R:  Mm.
L:  She told me they were too old for her.  I don't know -- she meant because they were -- the year they were made, yeah, they're so old, or uh, she didn't understand them.
R:  Right.  Probably too [NOISE] like, old -- old fashioned.
L:  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking too because she's a smart kid --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and reads Harry Potter so ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't think Nancy Drew would be t- -- that too har- -- too hard of a book to read.
R:  [NOISE] Right. [NOISE] 
L:  So 
R:  So, the only thing I can think of is, um [NOISE] they're putting, like, [NOISE] as far as, you know, when kids go to the [NOISE] library at school and have their free time reading they're putting age limits on books.
L:  Right.
R:  Like, that -- that kinda -- that kinda censorship I'm okay with.
L:  Yeah, I'm okay with that too.  Actually, my daughter's school doesn't have that, ah, because I worked in the library with the librarian and sh- -- the kids would come in and they can go all over the place and pick whatever books they want. [SIGH] I mean, she would tell them, you know, if it was too old for them or too young for them, but if they wanted to keep the book, they coulda kept the book.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, I could understand if the book is too old you shouldn't let the child take it out.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Right -- right.
L:  You know, maybe -- not even -- not only because of mature content of it but maybe 'cause it's too hard for them to read.
R:  Mhm.  [NOISE] And it would make 'em discouraged.
L:  Right.  Yeah, so  [MN] 
R:  So, yeah, I per- -- I -- I think that's the kind of censorship I agree with --
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- but I don't agree with that, [NOISE] you know, "You can't teach certain, like [NOISE] To Kill A Mocking Bird like, I don't believe in that.
L:  Right.  I mean that -- that's a classic book.  It, you know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I remember reading it when I was a kid -- well, not a kid -- in high school, you know?
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  And I enjoyed it.
R:  Yeah.  Same here. [NOISE] 
L:  You know, and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they used the N word but --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, it didn't affect me in any -- I didn't look at people differently --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- because of it.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  You know, it's taken place when you know African Americans didn't have rights.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?
R:  [SIGH] I th- -- I also think that whatever children want to read, as long as they're encouraged to read --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like um, [NOISE] I read a lot -- like the books I [NOISE] read growing up had a huge effect on me and then when I went to college I became an English major --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- 'cause I love reading so much, because of all the books I read in elementary school.
L:  Right.  Yeah.  So, I was a History major. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, nice.
L:  'Cause I love reading about history. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  That was my subject.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I mean, I enjoyed reading too when I was a kid --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- so  and I still enjoy reading.  I'm reading North And South now.
R:  Mm. [NOISE] 
L:  You know, so 
R:  [NOISE] I'm actually taking a -- [NOISE] a women's author class --
