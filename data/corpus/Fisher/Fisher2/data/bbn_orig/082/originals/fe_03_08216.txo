L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?  Hi.
L:  Hi.  I'm --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm Libby.
R:  Go ahead.  I'm sorry?
L:  I'm Libby.
R:  Libby, hi, this is Elena.
L:  Hi.  Hi, how are you doing?
R:  Oh, good.  How are you [LAUGH]?
L:  Fine.
R:  This is kinda weird. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  It is a little weird.  
R:  Um, so we're supposed to talk about whether public schools can censor certain books over others, I guess?
L:  Yeah, public and private.
R:  Public and private.  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, are we just supposed to say what our opinion is, that sort of thing?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  And --
R:  T- did you want to go first, or ...?
L:  Sure.  I can go first.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, I don't think that either type of sh- school has the right to censorship books, um, unless you know it's adult books that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when it comes to great literature they should be, you know, able to read --
R:  Mhm.  Whatever --
L:  Yeah.  A broad --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- view of different writers.
R:  I don't -- I don't know, it's kind of a touchy subject because, I mean, I personally don't believe in censorship, especially, you know, in literature or books or media, but it depen- it seems like one of those things that depends on a lot of other um variables, I guess you could say, because like their age group for one --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, you know, like there are certain things that I think somebody younger could read, but they shouldn't necessarily, you know, it's -- it's just not going to work --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or that like what the type, obviously what the type of material is, but in general I -- I don't -- I don't think I believe in it either because I think it usually seems to serve the purpose of like more conservative people [LAUGH].
L:  Hm.  Yeah and because I mean how is anybody going to learn anything if we kind of take that information away from them --
R:  Right.  Right.  
L:  I mean, whether it's good or bad, I mean that's how we learn from our mistakes.
R:  That's true.  That's very true.  Um, I think like fifty years ago, Catcher in the Rye was censored in schools, like they weren't allowed to read it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in high schools, which is just, I mean it's ridiculous because now everybody reads it, it's like standard reading, so --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- our kids could be saying that about us fifty years from now, "The wouldn't let us read" fill in the blank "And that was ridiculous".
L:  Right.  And th- then if you start saying, "Well, you know, they shouldn't be reading this, then, you know, it can get way out of hand, you know, where is it -- where can we draw the line?" --
R:  Right. 
L:  [inaudible]
R:  But I mean at the same time, like there's certain things if I was a parent like say my kids had to read something --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that was very, very religious, like they had to read --
L:  Right.
R:  -- a book that was like about Jesus or something, I would sort of want that, like that's a type of censorship too, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I wouldn't want that in my -- in my kids' like reading list.
L:  Right.
R:  So --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- it -- it kind of depends on [LAUGH] what --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what exactly are you looking at, so [LAUGH].
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, but maybe it should be kind of up to the parents to kind of --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] see what their children are reading and seeing if it's proper and up to their guidelines and stuff like that --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- but not the public.
R:  Mhm.  Oh, okay.
L:  You know, or the school system.
R:  Okay.
L:  You know.  It should the parents that say, "Oh, you know, it's okay to have that book there --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- I just prefer that my child not read it and they read something else" --
R:  Right.
L:  And I don't see that as [NOISE] total censorship.  Buckle up, please. [NOISE]
R:  Okay.
L:  I mean, that's -- 
R:  That --
L:  -- and that way, it gets the parents involved --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in their -- [NOISE] [several inaudible words] --
R:  Okay.  So, you're kind of saying it should like -- it should differ from one school to another, like the same laws shouldn't apply, it should be fixed or based on like um the families that are involved in that and that grade --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or that class?  I think that's really good.  Yes.  Hm.
L:  Yeah.  Because that way that gets the parents involved, who should be involved in what their kids are reading and looking at anyway.
R:  Right.  As opposed to politicians that don't even know the kids.
L:  Right.  I mean --
R:  Who are deciding --
L:  -- you know, or just on whatever, you know, swing it is right now, you know, there's certain tidal waves that say this was good and this was bad and, yeah, the politicians don't think the best things for us, they just think the best things for their career and pockets --
R:  Right.  Right.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I don't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- how long have we been talking?  I don't really -- this is like my first time doing this, so --
L:  Oh, okay.  They'll cut us off.  They'll come in and say, "It has now been ten minutes" --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- it is time for you to make your comments.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  How many of these have you done? [LAUGH]
L:  Um, this is my third one.
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  Yeah.  I've been kinda --
R:  Have -- is it like --
L:  -- strange.
R:  -- legit?  I mean --
L:  Oh yeah.  And in a couple of weeks you'll get a check for ten bucks.
R:  Nice.  That's very nice.
L:  Yeah.
R:  How did you hear about this?
L:  Um, this survey, money survey type thing, that ah, you know, I signed up for a bunch of different surveys --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- different things, I don't know what the other thing is, different research type things --
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  -- so um, how did you hear about it?
R:  Um, ah, through a website.  This guy just put a post on the website and said, "I did this and, you know" yeah, he said he got like a check for twenty bucks, so I was like, "Huh, this is -- it sounds pretty legitimate" so [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.  And it's kind of cool.  Where are you from?
R:  Um, I'm from Ohio originally.
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  But --
L:  Is that where you are right now?
R:  No, I'm actually in Indiana [LAUGH] right --
L:  Indiana.
R:  -- right next door, yeah.  So --
L:  Wow.
R:  Where are you from?
L:  Um, I'm Virginia Beach, Virginia right now.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's cool.  Is it really hot, or ...?
L:  Oh yeah, it's like ninety two degrees with a heat index of a hundred and five --
R:  Wow, is it --
L:  -- it's hot [LAUGH].
R:  Does it get really humid, or is it just really hot?
L:  Oh, yeah.  No, it's humid.  It's, you know, that's what kills you, it's the humidity here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, you could take the temperatures getting whatever --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it, you know, it could be seventy degrees and it's humid and it's, you know --
R:  Disgusting.
L:  -- miserable to go outside --
R:  Yeah.  That's exactly, actually, how it is here.  I just moved here like a month ago and right now it's like ninety three degrees, but it feels -- it's like you go outside and you can't breathe because it's so --
L:  Yeah.  It's so oppressive.
R:  Yeah.  It is.
L:  Oh, I hate it.
R:  But I used to live in Denver, Colorado and it gets really, really hot out there but it's very dry, so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but it's just as bad because like it's dangerous to be outside at certain points, it gets so hot.
L:  Really?
R:  So, they tell people like, "Try not to walk outside or be outside for a long time because you get heat stroke".
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Because the ground heats up.  Like everything just heats up so much that it's -- it's just -- it's like a hundred and ten degrees [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Yeah.  It's crazy.
L:  That's crazy.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, so are you a student?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or, like what do you do?
L:  No, I'm a mom, I have two kids and um I used to work, but with my second child it was just too much money to spend to work and [NOISE] so I decided to stay home --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and that's what I do at the moment.  What about you?
R:  Um, well, I was going to school but um I sort of left school, I kind of, I guess you could say dropped out, but not really because I want to go back to school --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but I guess I'm just taking like a long break from it, so --
L:  Taking a little breather.
R:  Yeah.  Taking a breather, trying to fi- and I really didn't like the school that I was at so I just decided to call it quits --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but um I actually do telemarketing now, so this is kind of funny that I'm doing this because like I spend the whole day talking on the phone anyway --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, and now you're going to do this to talk on the phone.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, now I'm just like, "Okay, this is a really, you know, this is like a new career" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's a good way to make money.  So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And it's -- it's not as stressful.  I think there's quotas and stuff for telemarketing it's a n- [NOISE] --
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  -- and there like a quota, like you have to do certain things --
R:  Um, yeah, you know, like it depends which one you work for or like what the company's like.  Mine is pretty good because you get um [LIPSMACK] you get like seven bucks and hour, no matter what, so that's not bad.  You know.
L:  That's not bad.
R:  And then if you make money, you get more, you know, like they either give you the seven bucks an hour, or however much you made, so it's -- it's really not a bad deal considering you get to sit --
L:  That's not --
R:  -- you know, air conditioned building and talk to people, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That sounds pretty cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's not too bad.
R:  So --
L:  I used to --
R:  Oh, I'm sorry.
L:  Go ahead.
R:  What are some of the other topics that um they made you talk about for the other phone calls?
L:  [NOISE] Um, let's see.  The last one was about football --
R:  Oh, no.
L:  Yeah, it was me and this lady from Maryland.  It was a riot, you know, we're
