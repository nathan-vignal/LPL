R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, I'm Christine.
R:  Ben.
L:  Hi, Ben.  You know how to do this?
R:  Yeah, sure.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Do you work for this or we're just two random people?
L:  Two random people.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, censorship, yes, no.
L:  Yeah, do you think it's right for them to censor certain books that kids can read in school?
R:  I think in private schools they definitely have the right 'cause it's private school.
L:  Right.  Well, I think they should do it in both.
R:  Yeah, to a certain -- yeah, to a certain degree in public school.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But who should it be up to in public school though?
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  Who should it be up to in public school though?
L:  Uh, I guess the parents.
R:  PTO.
L:  Yeah, PTA.
R:  Oh, yeah.  PTA that's it.
L:  [LAUGH] Right, I think the PTA have the -- should the right to censor certain reading material.
R:  Is it the -- is it PTA not PTO?
L:  No, it's PTA.
R:  PTA all right.
L:  Parent Teacher Association.
R:  There we go.  All right.  I agree.
L:  For an assignment that my stepdaughter read a book, uh, called Killing Mr. Griffin.  Have you read that one?
R:  No.
L:  It's about a bunch of high school who intended to scare a teacher and they ended up killing it by accident.  I don't think that was appropriate for an English teacher at the time --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- especially one that wasn't well liked.
R:  I don't see why the teacher would want them to read that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I'm eighteen.  I've been at private school -- I graduated from high school.  I'm in a private school so they -- so you pretty much pay a lot to get rid of all your stuff like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  So --
L:  Is it a Catholic school?
R:  Yeah, it's always been -- well, Jewish then I went to Episcopalian school.
L:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
R:  I don't know -- yeah.
L:  We went to Catholic school.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, they definitely censor your stuff there.
L:  Oh, my gosh --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- they do.
R:  All you believe is Jesus is good and whatever.
L:  Yeah, there were no love stories in the library --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- ones with Satan --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and what'll happen if you do it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, see I think -- I definitely think that the PTA should get more involved in what is put in those libraries especially now with all the killings going on in the schools.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, they need to take certain things out I guess.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I guess private schools, they're gonna take it out anyway because you're paying for it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They don't allow books like that in there.  I'm sure they didn't have to read Killing Mr. Griffin.
R:  No [LAUGH].
L:  And that just puts ideas in kids' heads.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Makes them --
R:  They'll try to scare their teacher and end up killing him.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Not exactly the book I would have picked.  Like they should put -- like when I was in school, we had to read books like To Kill a Mockingbird.
R:  Yeah.  I suppose -- that's the type of books I read.
L:  Yeah.  To Kill a Mockingbird and, uh, --
R:  Like The Invisible Man and --
L:  Between Mice and Men?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yes.  You know, those -- those are more appropriate books but I guess it's -- time's changing.
R:  Yes.
L:  And like --
R:  Uh, and like some people think you shouldn't be allowed to read Shakespeare then because that's killing and sex and all that.
L:  Yeah, I don't remember reading too much Shakespeare.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't think we had too much Shakespeare in school.
R:  [MN]
L:  Yeah, we didn't see, uh, -- my stepdaughter doesn't come home with much Shakespeare either.  You know, just these other weird books that I'd never heard of.
R:  Uh, I-- I've never been much of a reader so ...
L:  Oh.  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH] But I know it's not a good thing.  I'll admit it but, uh.
L:  Oh, that's okay.  That's okay.  I'm -- I'm a big reader when I can.  I have a three year old who, you know, doesn't understand reading time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, boy these phone calls get hard, don't they?
R:  [MN] Ten minutes.
L:  Is it up yet?
R:  No, I think -- it -- have you done this before?
L:  Yeah [LAUGH]
R:  Doesn't it tell you or something?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You can only do one a day, right?
L:  Right.
R:  And up to three?
L:  Yeah.
R:  How'd you find out about it?
L:  Uh, on the Internet.
R:  Which website?
L:  Uh, Jobretise[?]
R:  Oh, really.  All right.  Fat Wallet.
L:  You what?
R:  Fat Wallet dot com.
L:  Fat warlock?
R:  Fat -- fat wallet.  F.A.T. wallet.
L:  Oh.
R:  They have like coupons and deals and surveys and --
L:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
R:  -- what not.
L:  Well, this is my third call so I guess I'll see if it's up to three calls or not.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I think you can sign up for more or something.
L:  OH, really?
R:  I don't know.
L:  Oh.  What state are you in?
R:  Texas.
L:  Are you really?  I have two sisters down there.
R:  Really?  Where in Texas?
L:  I have one in Houston, one in Dallas.
R:  [NOISE] I'm in Houston.
L:  Are you really?  
R:  [inaudible]
L:  She lives right near Cady.
R:  Oh, really?  I live -- I live in Sherry Lane.  It's like an hour away.
L:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
R:  So, that's not close [LAUGH].
L:  I have a, uh, a friend that lives in Parralynn[?].
R:  All right, I got ya.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's not that far.
L:  No.  We're in Virginia so we're pretty far from everybody.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  We're, um, about forty five minutes from DC.
R:  My girlfriend's going to Georgetown next year.
L:  Is she really?
R:  Yep.
L:  Oh, she's gonna live it.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I stayed in Texas.
L:  And you're out of high school now?
R:  Yeah, I'm going to UT.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  I could have gone -- I could have gone -- I got into Cornell but decided to stick down here.
L:  Well, that's -- at least you're going, you know.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  That's a really good thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, the last person I talked to she didn't stop talking the whole time [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Censorship in college?  Oh, now my phone's died.  That can't be good.
L:  Your what?
R:  My phone's dying.  That can't be good.
L:  No, I don't think it is.
R:  All right.  Are you there?
L:  I'm here.
R:  Okay.  Censorship in college, no?
L:  No.  I think you're old enough to decide what you want to read and what you don't want to read.
R:  What about in private colleges like -- with, like, religious college?
L:  No, I don't think they should censor but they're going to.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think, you know, once you hit the age of eighteen --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you're a person to decide what you want to read and what you don't want to read.
R:  Yeah, I have friends going to Baylor and they, like a year ago, just allowed dancing.
L:  Allowed dancing?
R:  Yeah, with girls.  Like guys and girls dancing.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  If -- if they, uh, what's the word?  I don't even know what type of school it is.
L:  You went to an all boys school?
R:  Me, no.  Hell, no.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  Wouldn't do that.
L:  Hey, I wouldn't imagine that.  I think, yeah, when -- once you hit the age of eighteen, you know, I think people get the point where, like, "Screw what everybody else thinks, I'm doing my own thing".
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause you're not forced to go to -- to high school and you follow what everybody else does and try to be like everybody else.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I think, you know, by that time you're old enough and more mature mentally to be able to pick and choose what you want to read.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I think they should censor what people are allowed to write about.
R:  Yeah.  I have call waiting.  You don't answer it though, right?
L:  No.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  No.  Yeah, they shouldn't be able to, uh, write the books on how to -- what's that book they had on the television the other day?  How to make a mail bomb.
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  Yeah.  Why would you put something like that out?
R:  Well, they have all that crap on the Internet now.
L:  Yeah, or how to make, uh, --
R:  Any type of bomb.
L:  That and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the poisons to kill somebody.
R:  [LAUGH] That's good.
L:  Yeah.  I think they should censor more of what you're allowed to write and then we wouldn't have to worry about the censorship in schools.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  What have been the other topics?
L:  Um, the first one was professional sports on television --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and the other one was, um, something about uniforms in schools or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that's the one that the lady didn't stop talking the entire time.  She had six kids so I guess, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it was easy for her to talk about.
R:  [MN]
L:  I haven't -- this is the first guy I've had on the phone.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Usually it's women, yeah.  Yeah.  My sister's doing it, the one that's in Dallas.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yes, so we're trying to --
R:  I g- I guess they're trying to get guys, more guys.
L:  Right.  Yeah.  Well, my sister's gonna do it and we were trying to hook up with each other.
R:  So, you can let relatives do it?
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  Relatives can sign up?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I wonder if it's gonna be a trouble if, uh, this is the same address.
L:  Probably not --
R:  No.
L:  -- if you've got more than one person in the house.
R:  Yeah.
L:  My husband wouldn't do it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, that's okay.  He's not much of a talker.
R:  [MN]
L:  Rod, do they have censorship in Australia? [NOISE]
R:  Is he from Australia?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I spent my last summer there.
L:  Where at?
R:  I went to Australia for three weeks, New Zealand for two.  Like in Australia I went to Sydney, Cairns and Melbourne.
L:  Oh, he's from Melbourne.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Have you been there?
L:  No, hell no.  Twenty three hour flight.
R:  So, it's the best place ever.
L:  A little bit hot down there.
R:  Everything's like the same price as here except it costs -- like our money is worth one and a half times the amount.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, we send, uh, money over there.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  If we send fifty dollars, then they actually get a hundred so [LAUGH] it works good for me.
R:  Yeah, I mean they -- they can't afford to come here.
L:  No.  Well, we've -- he's got a couple of kids over there.  We've brought them all over here.
R:  Oh, I got you.  Yeah.
L:  So, you know, they've traveled back and forth.
R:  It's so hard to move there like they -- when I was there they said like if you're over thirty five, they don't want you.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They don't hire many Americans either from --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what I understand.
R:  Um, best thing to do is work there and get paid in American dollar if you can [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, is -- are they -- they're gonna like listen to our phone call and [LAUGH] --
L:  Totally off the subject.
R:  -- throw it away [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Hey, we talked a little bit about censorship.
R:  Censorship in Australia.
