R:  Hi, I'm Amanda.
L:  Hi, I'm Linda.
R:  [PAUSE] 
L:  [PAUSE] 
R:  Hi Linda. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I -- are we supposed to start talking?
R:  I think so.
L:  Okay.  This is the first time I've done this so ...
R:  [NOISE] Me too.  Um ...
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you want to --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- go ahead and tell me how you feel? [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Well, [LIPSMACK] I guess it's cens- censorsh- -ship and private or public schools ah on books.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Is that --?  I -- I couldn't quite understand her but --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I think that's what it was. [SIGH] Um [LIPSMACK] well, huh --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- not giving this too much thought --
R:  [NOISE] [NOISE] [NOISE] 
L:  -- I guess I feel like, um, [LIPSMACK] if you're attending a private school and you know, you're paying a huge tuition, then I guess the school --
R:  [NOISE] [NOISE] 
L:  -- probably has some right to +censor, you know, what -- what books are in the library.  [SIGH] Public schools I'm not so sure but I agree that censorship belongs there.
R:  [NOISE] Um.  I -- I'm kind of under the im- --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- opinion that, um private schools should have a little bit more say because, um you know like, [MN] speaking like from my point of view -- it's like I have children and um, [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] if I'm sending my -- my son to a private school and I feel like I should be able to have some say in the criteria -- you know the stuff --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  -- that's taught to him.
L:  Yes.
R:  [NOISE] But in public school I think that there should be a standard --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- um, that should be upheld.
L:  Yes.  And I think um, in a -- in a -- in a public school, you know we do have a -- a certain amount of say through our school boards --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the hiring and the firing [LAUGH] of [SIGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- of um, you know the people in the ad buildings and ah -- but at the same time ah, I doubt that censorship could be as enforced in a public school as it definitely could be in a public -- I mean in a private school.
R:  Definitely.
L:  Ah, and you know if we send our children to -- to private schools, ah we're going to send them to the ones that we [LAUGH] agree with.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, what they're teaching, how they're teaching and [NOISE] what they're reading so, um [NOISE] you know, I -- I just -- I feel that ah, although private schools are out of the reach of most people [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- financially, um, [LIPSMACK] I would probably -- if I just totally disagreed with my school system [SIGH] that -- that would definitely be an option for -- for me if I agreed with the private school's [NOISE], um you know, reading materials.
R:  Right.
L:  And I don't know if they want us to talk about [LAUGH] you know, even -- even censorship as far as what -- what books they're using to teach from, but um [LIPSMACK] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know I --I've -- I've always thought that was very important and I [SIGH] have always made a point of [SIGH] you know, going through every book [LAUGH] that my children have used --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um.
R:  Well, I'm kind of under the o- -- opinion that you know, they can teach what's -- whatever's out there I know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that a lot -- uh, out where I'm living [SIGH] there's been a lot of --of trouble with like Huck Finn and stuff like that because it says the word "nigger" in it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I am not prejudiced in any way, um, although I don't think it's bad to teach our kids that there were some ignorant people --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- at one time that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- used language like that --
L:  Right. [SIGH] 
R:  -- and that I don't agree with it, and why I don't agree with it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Now, I don't --
L:  [SIGH] Well --
R:  -- [MN] I -- and I'm not -- I'm not a black African American person um, and maybe they would feel differently, but I don't -- I don't see any problem with Huck Finn and I don't think that would be any problem.
L:  No, no, I don't either and I -- I -- I -- I've been, you know, hearing something uh said about that -- that controversy, but [SIGH] I -- and as far as you know, words like that -- i- in our reading ah in -- in any book you have to -- you have to kind of take into consideration the time in which it was written --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] and I think like Huck Finn, I'm not so sure that that wasn't a pretty acceptable [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know um, term then and um just to, you know ...  I mean I -- I feel like that term has probably been made into a derogatory term --
R:  Right.
L:  -- just in modern times and [SIGH] ah, there is just too many of those terms used for every [LAUGH] um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- nationality that, um [NOISE] -- you know, I -- I'm not so sure that -- that you know just they haven't been turned into that -- that sort of term.  But [SIGH] I feel like it's my responsibility to [SIGH] um -- to teach my children right from wrong --
R:  Mm-kay.
L:  -- and if I feel like that -- that word is -- is wrong, then [SIGH] you know, I -- it's my responsibility, but I see no harm in [SIGH]-- in them reading it and keeping it in context [SIGH] in Huck Finn.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I don't really want anyone else policing what I -- what they feel is appropriate or inappropriate --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um for my children to hear.  I mean, [SIGH] [NOISE] [MN] that's where parents need to stay involved --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and -- and really know what their children are reading.
L:  Right.
R:  Know what [NOISE] the curriculum is that -- [NOISE] they're going through. [NOISE] 
L:  Yes, yes.
R:  Rather than just letting it happen and then getting angry later.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think if you're up front with your kids that there's not going to be any big deal at all but --
L:  No, no. [SIGH] I mean I -- I -- I -- probably when I was in high school and had to read, you know, books like uh -- well, I mean [LAUGH] you could just go down a huge, huge list and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know um ...  I probably didn't even understand what I was reading at the time.  Like maybe Catcher in the Rye, or East of Eden, or all these books that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I mean that are -- now, we consider classic.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And now to read them you know it's like, "Whoops". [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  "Whoa that's politically incorrect!"
L:  I didn't even catch that in high school you know, because for one thing you usually don't read the book.  You use cliff notes you know?
R:  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  And um I -- I'm just -- maybe -- maybe children are more [SIGH] [MN] into it now [LAUGH] but ah --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I -- I just -- I truly believe that um even though there were some things that were taught in -- in our school system [SIGH] that [MN] I was totally against and you know just [MN] inflamed me [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I just, you know [LAUGH] -- I just went on the -- the theory that if -- if I was doing --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- my job at home, then they could -- they could read this and they could take a test on it but it wasn't gonna affect their, you know their morality --
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  -- about the whole thing.
R:  It's not gonna shape them and they're not necessarily like in the Huck Finn situation, [SIGH] it's not going to necessarily be a word that they just start flipping around just because they --
L:  No.
R:  -- read it in a book one time.
L:  No, no.  And [SIGH] you know there's a lot of wonderful, wonderful um [LIPSMACK] you know ah, there's a lot of wonderful stuff to be taken from Huck Finn --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and uh [SIGH] you know, I don't believe in censor- -- censorship --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- as far as changing the wording in a book --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- either, and w- we've had some of that in our school system --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- where they'll take a -- a book and they'll just, you know it's -- I mean, books have been rewritten so many times and [MN] you know, changed, and -- and they'll -- they'll take well, say for instance, Huck Finn --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they'll put the book in the library that -- that all this wording has been taken out of.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, you might as well not even read Huck Finn [LAUGH] you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because um --
R:  It takes away a lot --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- of the importance --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- of the book.
L:  [SIGH] And you know, maybe our children should know that -- [MN] that you know, this is one of the things that [SIGH] you know, we've had to change in our society --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and for the most part it's been changed.
R:  Right.
L:  But [LAUGH] at the same time [SIGH] I think they refer to themselves as that more often --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- than we do as --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.
L:  -- you know, [LAUGH] whites so ...
R:  Yes.
L:  You know, I don't know that it bothers them --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- as much as a lot of um groups would like to think it does.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] You know, fringe groups so [SIGH] ah ...  But I -- I did actually put my youngest son in a private school for the first three years because -- not because I really had anything against our public school system here [SIGH] but I was just so enthusiastic about what this private school w- -- and how they were teaching --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so um [LIPSMACK] and everybody said, "Oh, you'll have trouble then you know, integrating him back into the public school system", but you know what?  [LAUGH] Children are so resilient.
R:  Oh.  It's unbelievable.
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] So that wasn't even an issue.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But um [LIPSMACK] you know, I -- I just feel like, "No" ah, for the most part.  [MN] When we start censoring things it's -- it's going to get us into a lot of trouble.
R:  Right.  Then [MN] everybody's going to be ignorant and I think that there are going to be even harder times that -- ah well, between races and between just people who are different --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- in any way.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Right.
