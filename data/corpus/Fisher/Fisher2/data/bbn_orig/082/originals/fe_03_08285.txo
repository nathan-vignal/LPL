L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, [LAUGH] [NOISE] this is Kelly.
R:  Hi. [SIGH] I'm Christine, nice to meet you.
L:  Nice to meet you, too.
R:  [SIGH] Um, the topic is [MN] whether we think private schools should, uh --
L:  Public or private schools should -- what was it, prohibit?
R:  Some, um, particular books? [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah, I think that was it.
R:  [NOISE] Um, this is my first time doing this, [LIPSMACK] so I've never --
L:  Me, too. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Right, I'm not really sure what's going on. [SIGH] Um, I personally went to a private school and they definitely did prohibit us -- us from reading different things. [SIGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, [NOISE] and it really didn't have a -- a effect on me. [LAUGH] I don't know, [SIGH] I thought it was fine and, [LIPSMACK] um, p- private school and public school are reading different things when I was in school. [SIGH] Um, no --
L:  They were reading different things?  Like, public school read things that the private school didn't?
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And vice versa.
L:  Well, I think -- I think a private school, you're going to have that more because, uh, obviously it's a private school, so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [SIGH] there's more -- they can do more things, I guess, that they want to do, whereas public school, [SIGH] I don't know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I guess they get away --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- with more.
R:  [NOISE] Right, and also in private school, if [SIGH] -- if it's a religious, they're not going to want you to read certain topics. [LAUGH] Um, so, they might not want you reading things -- [LIPSMACK] not as -- not that public schools encourage it, but, you know, it just might be more censored within a p- private school if it's religious.
L:  Right.
R:  Um [MN] --
L:  Yeah, I went to public school.  I don't know, I guess they -- [SIGH] I don't know if they particularly censored --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I guess they probably did --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] it was more or less the teachers did --
R:  Right.
L:  -- decided. [SIGH] 
R:  But, there's always a curriculum too that I imagine the state follows. [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] Um, [SIGH] so they can't be picking books out of nowhere [SIGH] I mean, they have to --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [SIGH] teach the kids something. [SIGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, but I don't -- I don't know, I've never really thought about it [LAUGH] to be honest. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] I know.  So, what was the question? [SIGH] Do we think that they should --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- prohib- prohibit for -- reads their books?  Yeah, I guess they should. [SIGH] I mean, you don't -- some things are just offensive to some people and -- [SIGH] I mean, to a point, I guess if it shows historically, like, say, slavery or something, [SIGH] they're talking about it and there may be negative connotations in it or something, but I may just show [SIGH] that was the mindset back [SIGH] however many --
R:  Right.
L:  -- years ago, you know, and if --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- y- if -- yeah, I think if it's presented in the right way [SIGH] that you can learn from it, even if it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is negative, I guess. [SIGH] You know.
R:  Yeah, I agree.  I think that some books that may be [SIGH] prohibited I wouldn't personally -- if I did have kids I personally wouldn't want my kids reading about, like [SIGH] -- I know there's a lot of books out there written by pretty young authors about, [SIGH] you know, kids that are on drugs at age ten and twelve, I p- personally would want [LAUGH] my kids reading that. [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] You know, but then again, I don't really know why they would [SIGH] have that in a school setting.
L:  Right, [SIGH] unless maybe they could learn from it.  I guess it depends on what degr- how it was presented, you know, if it had a story of a ten year old that was on drugs and -- [SIGH] and it didn't go too into detail and too -- you know, tell too --
R:  Right.
L:  -- too much, and it just was --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- a more of a learning experience it might be good.  I have a eight year old, so it might be good for her to -- [SIGH] to read it and say, "See, this is what happened to this ten year old and --"
R:  Right.
L:  You know.
R:  I guess I was just thinking of, um -- [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] I'm not even sure if -- I think it is a book, but, um, the Basketball Diaries or something --
L:  I don't know.
R:  -- um, [SIGH] that was, like -- it just was really graphic of a teenager who's on drugs and [MN] I've -- I've never seen a more graphic movie about drugs so [SIGH] --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- [MN] and I was twenty something when I watched it, [LAUGH] so I guess it -- [SIGH] it just seems, um, [SIGH] I don't know, it's -- those sort of books would be --
L:  Yeah, you don't want to --
R:  -- but, I mean, in -- yeah.
L:  -- teach 'em things they don't already know. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Or I guess just make it so it's not too graphic. [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] But, um -- and mostly in high school I think I was reading [LIPSMACK] a lot of literature --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but I honestly really [LAUGH] don't remember. [LAUGH] 
L:  But I know now, like, oh, there's been talk, like, even Huckleberry Finn and stuff like that they've -- they've tried to prohibit that from schools.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn type books --
R:  Right.
L:  -- which, I know it says a few th- things in there, you know, negative connotations and things, but [SIGH] I don't know that they should prohibit --
R:  But like you said before, if it could be a learning experience for them [NOISE] then --
L:  Right, or if you pointed out, you know, it says this word or it talks about -- 'cause I know that there was slavery and that -- and that to go back to slavery is not -- but -- [SIGH] but, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that's part of the reason, you know, for that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- one I think. [SIGH] But if you point out that was their mindset or, you know, back in the whatever century it was, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- then --
R:  And now that -- and we don't do that and [LAUGH] encourage --
L:  Right.
R:  -- them [SIGH] --
L:  Right, then that's not okay.
R:  Yeah, then I think it would be fine.  I don't know -- actually know if I read Huckleberry Finn, I don't [SIGH] --
L:  I didn't --
R:  -- it's not the --
L:  -- read it till college, actually.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I read it in college.
R:  I really don't even remember, I just remember readi- reading a lot of Shakespeare. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, we did too.  It was boring. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] I didn't really like it.
L:  [SIGH] I think in h- college, in public or private schools, they probably have more leeway than they do in high school.
R:  Right, definitely.
L:  Just for --
R:  And especially in college, the electives and [SIGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  [MN] 
L:  They read a lot of weird stuff, maybe. [LAUGH] 
R:  R- right, and a lot of times it's -- was, um, things that the professor had written or a different -- [SIGH] teachers in the [SIGH] -- at -- that worked at the college had written, at --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- at my school anyway. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I know --
L:  But hopefully by that age we know right from wrong, I guess.
R:  Right. [LAUGH] 
L:  So, if you read some book that has some opinion, you're not going to be -- you know, [SIGH] or this about something -- some certain things, you're not going to think, "Oh, well, that's how I should be". [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH] You're already developed, hopefully, by that time.
R:  Right, and you have a process of [SIGH] right and wrong. [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I think in high school you do too, but maybe you're just a little unclear because you're [LIPSMACK] learning everything and figuring out who you are [SIGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and what you believe in and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- be like -- a lot of times in high school things can change just from one semester to another, who you're friends with and --
L:  Exactly, yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] that -- that sort of thing.
L:  Peer pressure --
R:  So --
L:  -- and all that stuff.
R:  Mm, right.  But I don't really think that prohibiting what they read will [SIGH] change who they are as people.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, personally, I don't know. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  But I guess it's good that they do prohibit some things, because I wouldn't want my kids reading some [SIGH] --
R:  Right. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- totally freaky, off the wall thing that, you know --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- I don't know. [SIGH] 
R:  Or something that they're -- like you said before, like, they're going to learn from it, you wouldn't want it -- I mean, what are they going to learn from, like, a trashy romance novel, [LAUGH] you know, [SIGH] they're not --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so, I mean, if -- if they're going to learn something from the historical perspective, then it would probably [MN] be --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- beneficial. [SIGH] I guess it really depends on what the topic is and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um [MN] --
L:  I don't know, some of that Shakespeare stuff was kinda shady. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, that's true. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Adultery and murders and all of [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm, a lot of murders. [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I never really enjoyed that, [LAUGH] so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] I just remember --
L:  But --
R:  -- Macbeth was pretty, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- violent, I remember [inaudible].
L:  Yeah, and it's weird it's -- that's okay because it's Shakespeare and it's, you know, literature --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it's supposed to be great, but then if it was a -- a more modern thing --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and it had the same type of thing, then it might not be as accepted [SIGH] which is --
R: Mhm. 
L:  -- kind of weird.
R:  And Romeo and Juliet. [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.  Right.
R:  Committing suicide, [LAUGH] you know. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right, and there was a book -- I bet if there was a book written [SIGH] now, like, in current times and there was, [MN] you know, teenage kids and that -- and they committed suicide it would probably raise a big uproar, you know, this is [SIGH] showing kids, uh, suicide and all these th-
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's a way out and stuff.
R:  Definitely.
L:  [SIGH] So, I don't know.  I don't even know if maybe, um -- I don't know if there's ever been controversy or not, Romeo and Juliet.
R:  [MN] Yeah, I'm not sure.  I -- I know you're right about Huckleberry Finn, I know that definitely has, [SIGH] but, um, even thinking back to what I read in elementary schools, I don't really remember reading much about slavery or any really -- I remember just, like, reading Indian in the Cupboard for some reason. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  But I don't really remember reading anything too historical that would have been controversial.  Now that I can think of right now. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Right.
R:  But, um --
L:  [SIGH] I said too, I think -- this might be off the topic --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- a little bit, but I think a lot of the things [SIGH] that kids are presented with, especially history -- I was a history major, so [LAUGH] -- but, um, [MN] kinda, [MN] it excused our thinking just because the ways -- well, just for example, like, [SIGH] Christopher Columbus and everything, that whole thing really -- [MN] that he settled America and everything.  There was people here before him, you know what I mean?
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH] So, it's kinda --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's like they kinda skew the thing so, in a way, they are censoring what kids learn.
R:  Right.
L:  So, [LIPSMACK] I don't know.
R:  They always say that, like, history is taught differently in different countries and of course they're going to have a different perspective --
L:  Right.
R:  -- wherever they teach it and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- maybe even [NOISE] within different states, I'm not really sure. [SIGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Of course, in different states you're go- maybe you would more about the [SIGH] history of that state, if something -- I mean, I know -- I live in New York and we defin- definitely learned a lot more about New York [LAUGH] than other states.
L:  Yeah, yeah, that's true.
R:  But that's off the topic, [SIGH] so --
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Hm.
R:  Um --
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  -- I don't know.
L:  So, what else do we say about this, hm? [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't know. [SIGH] I guess I still think it's back to the curriculum that I guess it -- I would imagine they have to [SIGH] meet some sort of curriculum guidelines [NOISE] that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- students learn in a, like, different grade, [SIGH] but, um --
