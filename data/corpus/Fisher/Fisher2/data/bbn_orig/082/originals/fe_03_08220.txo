R:  Ah, hi.  I'm Sarah.
L:  Hi.  I'm Anne from Detroit.
R:  Oh, I'm from Pittsburgh [LAUGH].
L:  Well, hi.
R:  How are you doing?
L:  I didn't catch what they said, something about schools --
R:  Oh, I um -- well it was -- I wrote it down because l- yesterday I -- I didn't catch my question, um [LAUGH] now, I -- it -- it was should public and private schools have the right to forbid students from reading certain material?
L:  Oh.
R:  That was the question [LAUGH].  Um, so, I don't know, I never thought about it.  It makes you -- you have to think fast.  Have to come up with something to say about it [LAUGH] --
L:  Well, I know --
R:  -- what do you think?
L:  I -- I'm not sure about that.  I'm concerned when schools censor books, you know, when they say, um, children shouldn't be able to read X, Y or Z because some of the stuff they cent- censor is considered classics, you know --
R:  That's true, definitely --
L:  -- and I -- and I think under supervision, ah, I mean if we're having a discussion group afterwards, you know, um, with the teacher, you know, or you have to write a paper on it, you know how you do in school --
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.
L:  -- um, I don't have a problem with it.  On the other hand, if students are bringing in X rated trash to read, I have concerns, you know?
R:  Right.  I --
L:  I think you have a right to set the tone in your building.
R:  That's true.  That's definitely true, it's like a fine -- that's where it comes in, it's like a fine line.  I pretty much agree --
L:  yeah.
R:  -- totally with, you know, I'm definitely -- I'm not really a pro censorship type person, you know, I -- I'd be more like, you know, have access, you know, I'm pro having access to all -- all kinds of materials, you know, but in a school it becomes a little tricky because it's children, I mean it's not adults, you know, with their -- and I'm not like for X rated materials or anything, but -- but um, you know, the [inaudible] what not, you know, I -- I --
L:  I didn't hear you, it -- it bleeped out.
R:  Oh.  Sorry [LAUGH] I said the whole -- the whole free speech thing and what not, you know, I'm for that and free expression and -- and what not but, yeah, when -- like I agree with you when it comes to schools and children, it's um, you know, a little differ- difficult, like who decides, you know, what's inappropriate and what's not.  Like some things, you know, like ah pornography is at, you know, obviously inappropriate [LAUGH] but um --
L:  Well, the only thing is I hear and I mean I don't have um children left in elementary school or g- I don't have -- college is the youngest I have --
R:  Oh, okay.  Right.
L:  -- and um, but [SIGH] but I would wonder if kids with a definite -- in high school this would apply -- children with a definite political perspective or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- on -- on anything, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, sometimes they get carried away because they're so enthusiastic --
R:  Right.
L:  -- about their mission and they want to spread, you know, spread the word of God, um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- spread the word of Marx, um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- talk about, you know, drug, you know [LAUGH] --
R:  Kind of controversial things and what not --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  To an extreme and I mean to me the way the question was phrased was too broad minded because I'm -- too broad, rather --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because I think of all these things.  Well, gee, you -- you want children to have the right of free expression, you want them to have the opportunity --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to do it in a situation that is um more protected than the real world --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- and um you want them to be challenged intellectually so they think about what they're doing --
R:  Definitely, yeah, not --
L:  -- but [SIGH] but where do -- where do you draw the line?
R:  Right.  That's, yeah, it's definitely tough like ah yeah, I agree with what you said, you know, someone could get a little over zealous with their, you know, beliefs and what not and, you know, you don't want it shoved down other people's throats --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in a sense, other -- other students [inaudible] at the school, um, [LIPSMACK] but ah I know like they have, you know, a lot of times people have censored like their newspapers and what not that the schools will put out, like the little, you know, student newspapers and that --
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  -- y- that's always [LAUGH] many times they -- people will try to -- students will try and publish things in there that, you know, could -- could be inappropriate or what not, so I mean --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- things like --
L:  -- that's a prob too, yeah.
R:  Right.  Things like that, I mean I definitely think you -- you need to be watching out for that because anything that's going to be disruptive or offensive, you know, esp- you know, anything could offend anybody now [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, that's what I was just thinking when you said that [inaudible] I'm going like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- oh, wow.  Um --
R:  I -- I --
L:  -- anything can offend people these days.
R:  I know.  Like, it used to be just common sense, you know, when you determine what -- you know, what was offensive or not by common sense, like, you know, saying racist things to somebody, you know, is obviously inoffensive and inappropriate in a school, you know, but -- then  it --
L:  But you know, if you're raised in certain situations, what's commonsense to you may not be commonsense to another --
R:  Right.
L:  -- person, you know.
R:  That's true, right.  
L:  Yeah.  And so --
R:  And some people, you're right, some people may not have any problems with that, you know --
L:  No.  No.  You know, it's just like --
R:  It's [SIGH] --
L:  -- hey --
R:  [LAUGH] Right.  I mean it's -- it's tough and it -- it -- tough with a school where you have kids raised in so many different backgrounds --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, who's the -- you know, what they consider and even their parents would consider fine and, you know, no problem would be like, you know, atrocious to another person and their parents [LAUGH] so it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like --
L:  That is really, really true. I just think like um at work I'm in a -- where I work I'm in a plant and we have -- it's so diverse.  It's -- it's wonderful because there's a diverse, um, population, ah --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- racially, ethnically, place of origin --
R:  Right.
L:  -- ec- um, class wise, et cetera.  However, it's -- the -- the negative side is that, "Wow, you know, p-" [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You have to bit your tongue sometimes.  I mean, it's a real -- it's a real fine line that folks have to walk these days, I think.  And I think that makes it tough on schools.
R:  Right.  That's true, yeah, because that's -- I know like we have diversity training, mandatory diversity training at my --
L:  We do too.
R:  -- place of employment --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and that's always the focus.  And, yeah, I mean I wonder if it's -- if, you know, that would be something -- and I don't see schools really doing that, to my knowledge.  I don't have children, so I don't know um, you know, I'm only in my twenties myself, so I don't -- I don't really know, you know, what's going on there nowadays, but I know when I was in school they didn't have anything like that.  Really, you know, there wasn't really a big push on being accepting like that, so I wonder if that's something that's -- that's needed a little bit more.  But um --
L:  Yeah.  I mean I love it, I mean you never know, they h- they did a -- a survey and I -- there must have been -- of employees and -- and there's like three thousand, or two thousand employees there, so there's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, a lot to choose from, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I think there were, golly, easily thirty different heritages represented --
R:  Really?
L:  -- there and that's not even talking about within this country, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- places of origin.  I was born in the hills of Kentucky, I was born in New York Ci- you know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.  Right.
L:  So, um, the outlook, um, the diversity of opinion is -- is -- is just phenomenal.  I mean, it's just phenomenal and it never surprises me, you know --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- to sit down and listen to folks and I go like, well I take that back, it does surprise, me, Sarah [LAUGH].
R:  right.  I was thinking, I know -- it's like -- it's --
L:  Wait a minute [LAUGH].
R:  If you -- it's easy to be surprised, you know with -- with the, like you said, like the kind of people you come into contact are so diverse --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know?  Whether it be in schools, at work even just out in the general public.  The way people move and -- and, you know, people like from anywhere anymore, it's not like just your hometown, everybody was born and raised there and then that's that, you know --
L:  Well, the thing -- that's why I think it's important that schools not have to censor.  I mean, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because I think the real world, I mean increasingly is made up of -- of people of a wide variety of backgrounds and you need to have that -- the experience of those backgrounds, those thoughts, et cetera --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- as you come to terms with who you are and what your thoughts are.
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  But, golly esky[?] [LAUGH] on the other hand [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you have to work side by side with these people, it's like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- mhm, you know --
R:  That's --
L:  -- it's a --
R:  -- true --
L:  -- challenge --
R:  -- that -- I never really thought of that too, but yeah, even like, yeah, like you said, more important.  It seems to have -- have different viewpoints presented, you know, where -- you know, just because that's what your, you know, you have to -- schools are supposed to prepare you for life and [LAUGH] that's what life is all about [LAUGH].
L:  Isn't -- isn't that the truth --
R:  But [LAUGH] --
L:  But it's funny y- I didn't think of that until you said mandatory diversity training, because that's also -- we also have that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, and that only came because there were some people who acted inappropriately to other people --
R:  Right.
L:  -- primarily male, female things, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- other kinds of things that occurred in the company and so people got, you know, mandatory [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.  [LAUGH] You will accept this diversity --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  But um, but yeah, so I -- I -- I -- I think I have the same pretty much general opinion as well about the censorship.  I mean, you always have to have it, I mean, you know, people will go insane with things if -- if they know they can get away with anything, um, you know, as far as what can be presented in schools, but, you know, I think the bottom line is that it is important to be diverse and, you know, not just, you know, because it's also like whoever is -- who's doing the censoring --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, their views obviously have a pretty, you know, pretty big impact on what is getting censored, you know, like --
L:  Well, that's an important point too --
R:  Yeah.  Like who's --
L:  -- who's doing the censoring --
R:  -- censoring this?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  You know, is it the school administration, it could be made up of just a few people on the board, you know, um, I think I- when it comes to censoring, they should at least have -- speaking of diversity, at least a diverse, you know, maybe panel of people, you know, from different backgrounds, teachers, administrators, what not, that -- that may make the final decisions on things like that, rather than just a few.
L:  Well, that's really great [LAUGH].
R:  Right [LAUGH].  In a perfect world --
L:  Wow, where's my head on that one, yeah.  I like that.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]  Right.  I mean, that's like the main thing, I think, you know.  Giving one person too much power, I think that's even w- you know, like students, you know, complaining about the principal --
L:  And that's usually what happens, you get this group that bally hoos around stuff and they go like, you know, like theirs is the only opinion, you know?
R:  Right.  Right.  Exactly.  I think that's like pretty fundamental when it comes to any kind of -- yeah, censorship or anything, or, you know, it's like who's um -- who's all make these decisions.  Yeah, just a -- yeah, everyone needs to be represented, I think.  It's like the bottom line --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- at least with that.  But, um, hm.
