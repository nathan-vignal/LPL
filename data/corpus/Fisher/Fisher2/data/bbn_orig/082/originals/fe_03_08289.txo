R:  [LIPSMACK] Hi, I'm Amy.  How are you?
L:  Hi, I'm Eileen from Pennsylvania.
R:  I'm from New Jersey.  Nice to meet you. [SIGH] Um, I -- my fir- like, lost a [LAUGH] little service when I just went to hear the qu- what was the question that she said?  Did --
L:  [SIGH] Um, [MN] do we think that, uh, [SIGH] schools should have the right to make students read certain texts or certain books.
R:  Oh, okay. [SIGH] Um, do you want to go first?
L:  [SIGH] Okay.  Um, [SIGH] I -- I don't see anything wrong with schools requesting students to read a certain book [SIGH] unless [MN] there would be something within it, you know, that would be so upsetting to the person --
R:  Right.
L:  -- like language or something that really -- [SIGH] the parent or the child would definitely not want to read, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and would, [SIGH] uh, hopefully then tell the teacher or discuss it with the school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, [MN] normally, um, I -- I believe, you know, there should be fr- freedom of allowing people to read certain things and I know that there are certain [SIGH] texts that need to be [MN] read, you know, for a certain age group, but [SIGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [MN] um, [SIGH] I guess unless I was personally involved with seeing what the book was [SIGH] I -- I probably couldn't take a real hard stand [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- either way. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, no, this is true. [NOISE] This is true.  Um, yeah, I don't see anything wrong with it.  Maybe if it was somewhat they would think that maybe the parent or the child would be offended by, maybe they could just send a note home saying that that's what --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they're doing and if they have a problem the parent can call them to like, [SIGH] "I don't want my child to participate to this" or, "I sh- I wouldn't want them reading this".
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, but as long as they said something, like, I don't see it being a problem at all.  I mean, um, I don't think they'd do anything crazy like having nudity anything 'cause that's probably not right --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- to s- have them read that book --
L:  No. w- [MN] 
R:  -- but [MN] for education wise that maybe they would need to know when they're older, I don't see it being a problem.
L:  I mean, I realize that years ago, uh, there were no black studies.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, [MN] and now there's, you know, separate programs where they're introducing the books --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to the students and you know, I -- I think really it's part of history and it's -- it's probably important --
R:  Absolutely.
L:   -- um --
R:  I agree.
L:  -- you know, kids can't bury their h- heads in the sand.
R:  Yeah, they need to know what's -- what's going on around them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] They definitely do, so, yeah I d- I don't -- I don't see a problem with it, but I guess there's some parents out there that obviously do.  But, I mean, I don't know, if they don't like that, maybe you put them -- I don't know. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  They should definitely just send a note home, though, that -- I think that would work, or just --
L:  Well, I know in the past there have been like -- I've heard in the news where there might be one particular book I think maybe people object to.
R:  Um, [SIGH] I think I've heard stuff about that too, I don't remember what book it was, though.
L:  [SIGH] No, I'm trying to think of anything specifically.  I c -- I can't, right off the top of my head [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, um, I know of -- I've heard in the past number of years of, you know, like, maybe one certain text [SIGH] having something that, you know, was upsetting to people --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to think that their children were being exposed to.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] But --
R:  [LIPSMACK] I remember in, um -- in high school, we had to read a book called Go Ask Alice and that was all about, like, drugs, and it was all about this girl that -- [LIPSMACK] she -- sh- I guess she never did drugs and someone put a drug in her drink and she didn't -- she wound up becoming addicted to drugs and it's just [SIGH] really like off color [LAUGH] of stuff in this book, but --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- [SIGH] um, we read it, but no one's parents [MN] had a problem with it, and I think actually reading it, [SIGH] it made me think of [MN] -- like, you know, made me not want to try drugs [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because of all the turmoil the girl went through, so I think the book had a kind of a good thing, like, maybe it'll scare them so they don't do stupid things. [SIGH] So, [MN] I don't know, I mean, I could see that book maybe being a problem with some people, but no one ever had a problem with it in my class. [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] No, um, I'm trying to think also if possibly any, like, religious type books or if --
R:  Right.
L:  -- somebody, [SIGH] um would take a [inaudible] from something in a book [SIGH] that might be offensive to their religion, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- as they construe it, um --
R:  [SIGH] I -- I kind of see that as not -- like, I mean, parents who do get mad about that I think are kind of ridiculous because it's good for the kids to, like, see -- [SIGH] because religion's a big thing now, it's kind of like a lot of why we're in war right now [LAUGH] with --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- Iraq, so that's --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- like real life, so I think that it's definitely something that should be discussed and I -- I don't know, I think kids should -- should be exposed and talked about, like, the things that are forbidden, or it's like, some people try to shelter their children from stuff like that and [SIGH] I'm happy my mum never did because it's helped me learn stuff quicker and made me not make as many stupid [LAUGH] decisions as I probably would have. [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, and probably also while your parents, you know, [SIGH] can give you their interpretation of why they believe things --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's also nice to know another -- you know, an opposite thought.
R:  That's true.
L:  Not that the child maybe is going to adopt it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, you know, just to know that there are some concepts there.
R:  [LIPSMACK] I -- I definitely agree.  I definitely do. [SIGH] Well, I guess this is starting to become a bigger issue, because in school there's --
L:  It is.
R:  -- a lot of -- a lot of -- more -- they, uh, talk about a lot bigger things like to -- to younger children, but I think they need to know it [SIGH] 'cause they need to know what's going on in the world 'cause, I don't know, if they don't learn it from school, they'll try learning it from a friend and they'll just get it --
L:  Well, that's true.
R:  -- [LAUGH] [inaudible].
L:  And that's talking about censorship too, with sex education. [SIGH] Um --
R:  Yeah, I think that, yeah.
L:  Some of the younger grade -- [COUGH] 'cause they're introducing it in younger grades [NOISE] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but [LIPSMACK] I know myself, being a family counselor, not that you have to expose the child or [SIGH] educated them [NOISE] more than they can understand at their chronological age, [SIGH] but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they have to, [NOISE] you know, understand some things, because I think it's [NOISE] putting them at -- more at risk --
R:  Oh, I agree.
L:  -- uh, being out, you know, and not knowing some of these things.
R:  Mhm, 'cause there's a lot of kids now at, like, thirteen and twelve years old having sex and they don't even know what it is yet. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, that's true. [LAUGH] 
R:  They're -- but they're doing it, so I -- I think it -- at a younger age it's definitely good to -- to know what it's all about.  Like, I wish I would have learned more when I was younger.  Actually, I didn't really turn out too bad, I don't think, because I waited a while before I actually went out and did that, but [SIGH] I know a lot of kids around me, they were at thirteen having sex [LAUGH] and it was -- it's -- I don't think that's a good thing at all, you're not even an a- even close to being an adult yet. [LIPSMACK] So, I mean, I think it's good if they learn stuff like that at a younger age.
L:  Yeah, I know --
R:  So --
L:  -- 'cause I -- I know -- I'm trying to think. [SIGH] I'm sixty and the first sex education we had I think was in sixth grade --
R:  Really?
L:  -- and I think it was -- they were trying to segregate the boys from the girls, but then everybody got back together again, you know, and compared notes.
R:  Oh, when they -- when they taught it they separated you guys?
L:  Yeah, they totally did 'cause I -- I went to a private school that was, like, religious -- religion based.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  [SIGH] Um, [NOISE] and I -- I think probably I was really at a disadvantage because m- my mother had never explained anything to me.
R:  She didn't really -- kind of just -- was it kind of a shock to you when you learned that in school?
L:  Yeah.  Well, I think too, I think I was, like, ten and a half when I had my first menstrual period [LAUGH] and had no idea.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, nobody was [LAUGH] home.  I think I'd come home from some [SIGH] minor eye surgery [SIGH] and my dad --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- went off somewhere and my mother was doing something in the kitchen and it was, like, "Oh, my god, I'm dying". [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, god. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] You know, and, um --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- th- then --
R:  You must have been so scared. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- an older friend, she was, like, [SIGH] two years older, [SIGH] started bringing in books, like, little pamphlets they used to have then.  It was, like, from [SIGH] Kotex or Modess or one-- I think it was Kotex, [SIGH] you know, and explains --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, reproduction and everything and it was like, "Oh, gee". [SIGH] You know, I didn't have to be frightened.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know. [MN] So, I think, you know, based on to my own personal experience, and I was really [SIGH] adamant when my children beg- my daughters began asking questions, like, you know, prepare them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] You know, rather have that little bit of information than have them really be frightened.
R:  Definitely.  I absolutely agree.  I'm -- I'm definitely not going to -- if -- if I eventually have children, I'm not going to be against them learning stuff at a earlier age in school. [SIGH] Like, maybe there is certain things that maybe might be a little too extreme for them, but for the most part I think -- I think it would be a good things, like, they need to [SIGH] know what's going on in the world so they know what to expect when they get older, and it's not, like, such a shocker to them. [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] So, I don't know, I really think that, uh, it's -- censorship is kind of ridiculous. [LAUGH] So, I think the more you know the better, definitely.  But --
L:  Yeah, well we -- we can sort of read the books, if we don't like it, well --
R:  Mhm, and if they don't learn it in school they're just going to --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- go to their friends or go somewhere else and learn it and probably learn the wrong information . [SIGH] I mean, unless parents want to sit down and talk to their kids about it, but to be honest, uh, between my friends and everb- [SIGH] no one's parents, like, [LIPSMACK] sat down and talked to 'em about much of anything.
L:  [MN] You're right, that -- that's true.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Which they -- they should.  There -- well, there are parents that do that, I'm lying if I say that, but [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- um--
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- so there -- there are some parents that do, but a lot of 'em, they really don't.  they don't talk to their kids as much as they should, I suppose.
L:  No.  and -- and I know --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- that I -- [SIGH] as I came from a --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] sort of a conservative Juda-
