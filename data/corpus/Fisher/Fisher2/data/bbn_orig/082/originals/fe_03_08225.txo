R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  This is Lorrie.
R:  Hi, uh, John
L:  Hi John.
R:  Okay.  Um, I -- I -- I just want to make sure I'm clear on that it -- they were talking about, uh, regulating what students read, is that right?
L:  That's the way I understood it, yes.
R:  Okay.
L:  In private or -- or --
R:  Or public schools.
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay.  Good.  [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Do you have an opinion?  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Um, yes and no I guess.  I -- I -- I think that, um, some regulation into -- into what they read is [SIGH] probably a necessity in -- in keeping on track with where they're going.  But I think that the freedom of letting the kids choose is also a very important part.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I-- I agree.  I -- I, uh, think that, um, [LIPSMACK] it -- it is, um, important, uh, to censor, uh, the information that some, um, especially, um, elementary students read because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, [LIPSMACK] p- parents sometimes feel that, you know, they don't want their child exposed to, uh, for example, homosexuality, or issues related to sex.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, if you want to raise your child in that ma- matter, you should have, uh, the right to that.  Yet at the same time, um, I would be a little bit concerned because, um, [LIPSMACK] the f- -- the freedom of speech act -- [MN] that's what I'm trying to get at.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, it's important t- -- for, um, people, 'specially people in the educational system to, um, be exposed to many different things, um, in order, I think at least, to become independent thinkers --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to make decisions on their own.  Um, so it I -- I would say I -- I don't favor both grounds heavily.  I --I sorta take a -- a middle road approach.
L:  Right.  I -- I think --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that's why I would go as well because of the fact that --
R:  [MN]  
L:  -- that it is important that -- [COUGH] that they have some ability to -- to think on their own.  And I think the teachers have such an influence on what the -- the feeling of the kids --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- comes out even in the books that they read --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that -- that, um, I -- I think I would take the middle of the road as well.
R:   Right.  And, um, [LIPSMACK] as you were saying, again the w- w- -- th- that's why  it's so important to -- to -- to, um, I think the, um, [NOISE] both aspects are important one, uh, censorship, um, because I know with -- especially with, um, elementary and junior high school students, there're issues of violence, kids bringing guns --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and, um, [LIPSMACK] the news is talking about they're being exposed to video games and movies, that are not [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- right for them.  So -- so, definitely in -- in terms of, uh, the books that you allow them to read, perhaps m- -- uh, during that period of -- of their life, it's important to, um, filter that type of information.
L:  Right.  But -- 
R:  And then -- go ahead.
L:  No, I was going to say but then how much of that falls back on the parents versus the school?
R:  Right.  That's true.  That's true.  And I -- I don't think the school can do it all.  That's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that's right.
L:  No.  Definitely.
R:  Uh, there -- there probably f- -- just like, uh, working people about forty hours a week, um, but, um, the rest of that one hundred and forty hours so that we can [LAUGH] they can be at home and with friends elsewhere.  Yeah.
L:  Right.  That's very true.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Very, very true.  [LIPSMACK] Um, what about the high school level.  What do you think on the high school level?  We've been talking on the elementary and --
R:  Oh, on the high school level?  Yeah.
L:  Uh, just as a --
R:  [LIPSMACK] I -- I still think it's important to, uh, filter, um, [LIPSMACK] negative information, but especially at the high school level right before college --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I think it's important for a person to get, um, exposed to, um, different cultures, different, um, ways of thinking about issues.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, and I've always been, um, an advocate of, um, at that high school level, it's very important that, um, students have, um, good decision making cap- capabilities because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- legally [LAUGH] by eighteen, um, irregardless of anything else, they're considered an adult.
L:  Right.
R:  And, um, in my opinion it's important th- that the ability for them to make decisions on their own, to be exposed to different cultures, um, it's very important at that stage because thereafter they, um,  [LIPSMACK] basically, I mean, the parents are there but if they do anything wrong [LAUGH] you know, then --
L:  That's right.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- the legal system gets involved.
L:  They're on their own.
R:  They could be fixed -- they could be -- easily be facing, uh, twenty years to life.  Yeah.
L:  Right.  That's very true.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's very true.  I -- I agree I think they need to be exposed to diversity and in as much as they can be and -- and hopefully helping them make the -- the determinations or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, leading them down the right path --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that, um, [LIPSMACK] but, uh, as far as censoring anything  I -- I think that at that point it's -- [SIGH] there's pros and cons again to that.  [SIGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, by giving them the opportunity to -- to the negative or what we would consider the negativities, it's helping them make the choice to go to the right path hopefully.
R:  Right.  Right. 
L:  But then on the other hand it's -- [PAUSE] I guess they're going to learn it some place.
R:  Yeah, I -- I --I agree --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- um, I think, um -- [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] um, personally I -- I would hate for example for a library in -- in -- in a public high school or junior high school --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- to, um, restrict, uh, the books that the, uh, students could read to -- to --
L:  Right.  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- a specific type because, uh, I guess that that's part of the beauty of the education that, um, America affords, uh, students.  Yet at the same time though, um, in terms of, uh, censorship, um, [SIGH] that's really a tough question.  Um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- where do you stop?  What do you do?  Um, [LIPSMACK] I -- I -- I say you should ho- -- um, try to emphasize, um, activities that promote, um, social responsibility, socialization with ones peer- peers.  Um, and thro- -- and that -- do that through the literature.  Um, perhaps students would need to be, uh, like -- like you said, introduced to s- -- or to some of the negative in order to know how to handle it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- yet, um, it's -- it's as important to use that -- that literature there as, um, [LIPSMACK] a socialization text -- let me say it that way.
L:  Okay.
R:  Help them, um, the reason that that is, is just, um, I read the news for example, Columbine -- that -- that wasn't elementary school, [LAUGH] you know. 
L:  Right.  Yeah.  Yes.  That's true.
R:  This -- the situation in Atlanta I -- I, um, I don't believe that kid was in elementary.  I think he was in junior high.  So, um, and there's just something going on at that period [inaudible] I'm aware that there's something occurring in adolescents that, um, [LIPSMACK] students are having a -- a hard time at adjusting with themselves or coming to grips with themselves.  So, um, [LIPSMACK] whatever the literature does, um, it would be beneficial if it -- it could help socialize, uh, students to learn to get along with one another and not engage in, uh, such behavior.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Right.  That -- that's -- that's very true.  I wonder sometimes, um, now much of that is -- is the fact that the kids are being pushed to learn so much information so much younger.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, [PAUSE] you know, in that [PAUSE] [MN] the [SIGH] [MN] -- it -- in evolution and progression they have to have, um, things have to --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- go along but it just seems like in some cases, when they go to school and have to be able to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- read, write and they're doing multiplication by first grade --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, where you used to, you know, it's that old adage, you know, "When I was a kid" type thing, but --
R:  Mm,
L:  -- y- -- how much of it in -- in -- maybe that's where the censorship is good is in the younger grades.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Th -- that -- [MN] that one's, um, [SIGH] I -- I know that there are various theories out there, um, of -- of intelligence and what students can do.  And, um, I also know that, um, you know, people who are -- whom are very intelligent and, um, can blaze -- kids who can blaze through first second, third, et cetera, [NOISE] et cetera.  Sometimes there's that other aspect that they're m- -- missing, uh, socially.
L:  Right.  Oh, absolutely --
