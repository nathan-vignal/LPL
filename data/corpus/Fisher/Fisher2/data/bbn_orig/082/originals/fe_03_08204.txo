R:  Hello? [NOISE]
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, my name is Stuart.  What's yours?
L:  Ashley.
R:  [SIGH] So, we're supposed to talk about censorship in the school.
L:  Okay.
R:  Okay, uh, well, how do you feel about it? [NOISE]
L:  Um, I don't have a problem with it [MN].  
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, [LAUGH] neither do I.  Uh -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I do have a problem with it, I mean.  I don't think schools should censor --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- children, unless it's pornogr- -- unless it's pornographic material.
L:  What are you saying, like, that they can't read something or that they -- I mean, it depends, like, whether they can recommend things.  I don't think that they should say [inaudible] there isn't something that [inaudible] read but -- [MN] I mean, are you, giv- -- like, talking, like, giving them, like, a curriculum?
R:  [NOISE] Uh --
L:  Some --
R:  Let me just turn this down.  I have a hard time hearing you.
L:  [MN]
R:  Um, could you say that again?
L:  Are you saying that they -- giving them, like, a curriculum -- I don't think that there's something that someone should say they couldn't read --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- but I also don't have a problem with them telling them things to read.
R:  R- right. [NOISE] Um, [SIGH] what else -- what else are we supposed to talk about this?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We ha- -- we have to talk for ten minutes.
L:  We're supposed to talk for ten minutes?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh.  
R:  About the subject.
L:  Okay, um, [LAUGH] I don't know.  I went to a private school and, like, I -- I wouldn't say they ever said there was something that I couldn't read.  But, at the same time, like, I don't -- certain people have a problem with, um, [LIPSMACK] like, religion and giving them -- [MN] being able to read everything there is about it.  Like, I don't think that there's things that they should restrict.
R:  Right.  
L:  But at the same time I also don't -- I think that it's good that they tell you things that -- I mean, I think certain age groups shouldn't be reading certain books.
R:  Right.  But I think --
L:  You probably feel --
R:  -- I think the bottom line should maybe come to the parents.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, but I agree with that.  [MN] I agree with --
R:  That they should have the option, you know, to say, "This is okay for my kid" or, "This is not okay for my kid".  
L:  Right.  I don't think it's up to the school, actually, to be deciding -- like, for -- in fact, I don't think the school should be responsible for raising their children on anything, sex, religion.  I don't -- I think it's the parents' responsibility, not the school's.
R:  Right.
L:  Sorry, my phone's beeping, but I'm not getting it [LAUGH].
R:  Right, I think the school should somehow mind more their own business --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and just teach basic -- basic knowledge and leave the other stuff out for the parents --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- how they wanna deal with it.
L:  But, I mean, I think also if you're paying [SIGH] -- I mean, I -- I -- again, I was private schooled.  I went to, um, [SIGH] [inaudible] school, so they actually had -- I went to cathedral and I had assembly and stuff like that, but, [SIGH] like, I also took religion, learn about all different types of religions.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But it's -- you're paying for a school, and, like, that's wh- -- you know, that's what you're getting into.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I don't have a problem with that [SIGH].  Um, but I also don't think it's, like, appropriate to give, like, to let little kids, uh, if you're, like, in fourth grade, to just, like, let them be able to read anything they want --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in the library either [SIGH].
R:  Right.  But the --
L:  But --
R:  -- right, but who's -- who's to say?  I mean, it's kind of hard to draw a line.  
L:  Yeah, I mean, I think the parents obviously should be m- -- like, watching what their kids are obviously reading, but at the same time, like, if your child goes to the library at school, [SIGH] I think that the library maybe should be aware of what's being checked out by, like, a fourth grader.
R:  Right.
L:  I don't know.  I mean, it's the same thing, I guess, with music.  I mean, I think that's up to the parents too, but I guess if they -- if the parent knows that there's a rating on it, I guess.  Like, you wouldn't let your child go to a rated R movie if they're, you know, ten.
R:  Right.
L:  So, maybe, like, they're, like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in that aspect, yeah.  I mean, like, cou- -- you know, you are also there as a teacher.  I think sometimes, like, [SIGH] -- ah, if the kid ta- takes it home maybe, but at school, like, I don't think they should be allowed to check out [SIGH] certain things.
R:  Right.  Or the teacher or the librarian or whoever should call the parents and ask the parents if they have a problem with it.  
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.  Like, if there's -- if -- as long as they know, but, I mean, I don't think it should be their decision.  I don't know, I don't think I ever, like, actually went to look up stuff like that [LAUGH].  But it's the same thing with, like, the internet.  Like --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I mean --
L:  -- if there's, um --
R:  Right, kids could read anything on the internet.  Do you have --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- any kids?
L:  No [LAUGH].
R:  Okay.
L:  But I still don't think little kids should be allowed to, like, [SIGH] get on certain sites, because, like, you know, even game sites -- like, I actually talked to this little girl who was twelve, and she's -- I'm like, "Do your parents know that you go and chat and stuff?"  And, like, they don't [SIGH].  I mean, she could be talking to, like, some, like, sixty year old dirty man, [LAUGH] you know --
R:  Oh [MN].
L:  -- dirty old man.
R:  I know, it happens all the time and I think that's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- really bad.  I don't know --
L:  But they can put parental controls on it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- which, like --
R:  Well, I think all parents should control the -- the -- the computer for their kids --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- especially when their kids are young.
L:  -- but they don't.  [inaudible] don't.
R:  [MN]
L:  Like, this girl was twelve, and she was, like, playing -- [several inaudible words] playing pool with her, but, you know, [MN] she's like -- and she talks to her friends at school, but I -- her parents don't know that she, like -- [SIGH] I mean, if she can get on that site, she can get on lots of other sites.
R:  Right.  
L:  And that kind of like [LAUGH] --
R:  You know, and --
L:  -- I was like, "I don't think --"
R:  Right, and anybody can say, "I -- I -- I'm just -- I'm a fifteen year old kid" when they're thirty five years old.
L:  Exactly.
R:  I mean, you know, you can make yourself to whatever you wanna be on the internet.
L:  Yeah, I -- that's, like, a little more freaky to me than a book [SIGH].
R:  I know, that is -- that is a bit freaky.
L:  You know, because --
R:  How'd you get involved in this thing?
L:  I dunno.  I don't know what this is.  I think one of my friends did this.  Is this like, um, what is this that I signed up for?  I think my mother might have done it for me.  I'm actually at work.
R:  It's from the University of, uh, Pennsylvania.  
L:  [SIGH]
R:  It's -- they call you up and then they give you a topic, then you have to speak ten minutes on the topic, and --
L:  Is that what it's from?  I [MN] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- my -- my -- ugh, my dad's a trustee there, that's probably why [LAUGH].  I'm, like, sitting at my desk, and the phone rings, and I'm like -- it's my cellphone, and I was like, "What is this?".
R:  Where are you?
L:  I'm in New York [LAUGH].
R:  York, Pennsylvania?
L:  No, uh, New York City.
R:  Oh, New York City.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay, uh, I'm out --
L:  Where are you?
R:  I'm out in Cliffside Park[?], New Jersey.  
L:  You're in New Jersey?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  Are you at work?
R:  No, I'm home.
L:  Um, okay, so did someone -- like, a recording called you and it called me?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay, and then we -- they're, like, recording what we're discussing?
R:  Right, they said -- they said talk about the -- censorship in --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I guess it --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- and I guess eight or nine minutes, then we'll get a recording and they'll tell us what to do next.
L:  [SIGH] Uh, that's -- and it's for Penn?  That's so bizarre.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Did you go to Penn?
R:  No, no.
L:  [SIGH] Okay [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] No, I don't. 
L:  Okay, I don't -- I [inaudible] -- I would say that probably one of my parents did this [LAUGH].
R:  Probably.
L:  [SIGH] 'Cause I'm at work and, like --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- normally people don't call my cellphone.
R:  So, we have a few more minutes here. [MN]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, okay. [LAUGH] I did not know what this was.
R:  Yeah, it's a strange topic.  I didn't, uh, I didn't expect that.
L:  [LAUGH] [MN]
R:  And I really didn't know what to expect, but, uh, I guess I didn't expect that.  
L:  Do -- where did you sign up --
R:  Anyway, back to -- huh?
L:  Where did you sign up for this?
R:  It was just a thing for doing, um, telephone calls, [MN] kind of, uh, you talk for ten minutes and then you get paid, and then, uh --
L:  Oh.  I'm sure my parents did this.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]  
L:  [LAUGH] It was probably my dad, yeah [LAUGH].
R:  Okay, so, uh, I think --
L:  Do you have children?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [inaudible]
R:  Yeah, I have one, uh, twenty six year old son.
L:  Oh, okay, well, hm, guess you don't really have that problem [LAUGH] --
R:  Uh, no.
L:  -- with the internet [LAUGH].
R:  No, uh, I don't have that problem.  So, I --
L:  No, but --
R:  -- think that maybe the school should send a list to the parents of what -- of, I guess, all the possible yes and no books and let the parents say which ones they want the kids to read and which ones they don't want the kids to read.
L:  Yeah, but there's also, like, [inaudible], like, all the schools have computer labs now --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and so they can -- they can [inaudible] -- even if they can -- can -- can't get on stuff at home, they can go to the computer lab --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and download stuff.
R:  Sure, they can --
L:  I mean, I know I can even get on my hotmail here at work, but I would say that a lot of children, especially at school, like, their firewalls aren't very, um, secure.
R:  Right.
L:  So they could probably get on tons of stuff.  Like, I don't think, like, ten year old boys should be able to get porn, I mean, for example [LAUGH].
R:  Right, they probably put some block on that as -- you know, on the servers, but still, they can get a lotta garbage.
L:  Yeah, they can.  And I know, like --
R:  More than just going through the library and picking out books.
L:  Exactly [LAUGH].
R:  I mean, a lot worse.
L:  But I guess then the school should be responsible for that, I guess.
R:  Well, I guess --
L:  I mean --
R:  [SIGH] I mean, if the school puts up the computers, they should have some kind of block or control or something.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I think that's true.
R:  Especially for kids that are under, ah, you know, eighteen or whatever, which --
L:  [SIGH] Right.  Because, honestly, most of the kids probably are better with computers than their parents --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just I mean, based on the generations today.  Like, when -- I know my dad's not exactly a star pupil[?] on the computer.  So, I can imag- -- and most, like, six year olds can probably use a computer better than most adults right now.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH] So, I would think that they should -- that should be done in schools [SIGH].
R:  Right.
L:  [MN] I feel like this is, like, a half an hour [LAUGH].
R:  [inaudible] Look, it's been, uh, seven minutes, so we need to --
L:  Are you timing this?
R:  Well, I'm just looking at my computer.
L:  Oh.
R:  I'm looking at the computer.  Let me --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  What does it say here, uh, speak on the phone for at least eight minutes.  After ten minutes has expired, you will have the opportunity to leave feedback.  So, we have another, uh, two minutes.  
L:  Oh, okay [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, this is very strange.
L:  [MN] I know.  I didn't [SIGH] know what to think.  Um --
R:  Yeah, m- -- I've never done anything like this before.
L:  [LAUGH] Is -- what does it say?  It just said censorship in schools?  Is that what it said?
R:  I guess, [MN] it was very unclear to me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It was just part of some --
L:  It was --
R:  -- survey.
L:  Yeah, it was [inaudible] -- 
R:  That they call you up with different subjects, and if you wanna talk to somebody for, you know, ten minutes on that subject, then -- you know, it was like a robot phone that called me and said, "Do you wanna do it?" and I said, "Okay".
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, me too.
R:  You --
L:  But I didn't know what it was asking me. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I was like, "Huh?"
R:  [NOISE] [MN] 
L:  I just didn't say anything, actually. [LAUGH]
R:  No, [several inaudible words] so, for at least eight minutes, okay, so we did.
L:  Yeah.
R:  After the ten minutes has expired you will have the opportunity to leave feedback about the call.  Okay, that should be coming up, uh --
L:  Okay, I think ten -- wait, I think, depending on the subject -- I'll leave feedback now.  Depending upon the subject, [SIGH] I think that ten minutes may be a little long, especially if -- unless people have, like, conflicting views.  I mean, I don't really think there's, like, a lot of people that would argue that schools shouldn't censor some things --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- especially computers.
R:  Right.  
L:  [SIGH] It's like, I mean --
