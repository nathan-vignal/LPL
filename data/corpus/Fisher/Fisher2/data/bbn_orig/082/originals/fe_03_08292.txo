L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, I'm Kelly.
R:  Hi, I'm Sarah Anne.
L:  Hi, nice to talk to you. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Same here.
L:  [LAUGH] Uh, I didn't quite hear exactly what she said.
R:  [SIGH] Um, I think she said that, um, the topic is, uh, whether public or private schools have the right to --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- say that kids should read certain books.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I think th- I think that's what she [NOISE] said.
L:  Okay, okay.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Uh --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, well, for me, I think, uh, there's a certain sort of canon of literature.  So, I think that that's fine to have [LIPSMACK] a -- you know, a set number of books that they have to read --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but not that those are the only books that they do read.
L:  Right. [SIGH] Um, I think I agree with that and, um -- but I know in certain cases there, [SIGH] for instance in -- when I was in high school, um, there was some talk about removing some books from the shelves, and I remember one of them was Wizard of Oz, you know, and I think that [MN] some people go a little too far trying to limit things that -- that kids read. [NOISE] Um --
R:  Um, yeah, I -- I guess so, um, and it's true, I think every now and again, I don't know, somebody gets some idea that some book is, like, unacceptable or inappropriate for certain age groups, which I think is, um, [LIPSMACK] uh -- I mean, there -- [NOISE] there are some books that, you know, young kids shouldn't read, but for the most part, I mean, I think it's sort of taking political correctness too far, in a way --
L:  Right.
R:  -- when they try to get rid of certain, um, [LIPSMACK] certain books.  Do you remember what their objection to The Wizard of Oz was?
L:  [SIGH] I -- I can't exactly remember, but I think, [MN] uh -- [SIGH] I think it was something about dr- drug use with -- with -- when there was this -- a part where they -- they ate a flower and [SIGH] -- and they felt that that was -- had something -- had some link to hallucinogenic drugs maybe.
R:  [SIGH] Oh.
L:  I think that was the problem. [SIGH] 
R:  That's kinda --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I don't know, that's -- to me that is obscure too, as a reason to get rid of a book.
L:  Right, [SIGH] and I guess that will -- that will -- I guess there will always be, [MN] you know, those -- those people that [SIGH] try to find -- that [MN] seem to be looking for a fault, you know. [SIGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  Um --
R:  Right, and I guess, I mean, the -- the [NOISE] other thing is I think perhaps what should happen is they examine that sort of, uh, [MN] you know, list of books, and perhaps they could add books to whichever book they're taking away.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, the thing with the specialist classics, I mean, some of them were written fifty years ago, hundred y- you know, a hundred years ago --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, it was a different time.  I mean, [NOISE] if you look at Mark, um -- [LIPSMACK] Mark Twain's books, like Huckleberry Finn and that kind of stuff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, a lot of them are sort of racist, but you have to sort of put in context of the time --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and take from the book, you know, w- the -- the things that you can take from the book.  I mean, it's certainly good writing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, and I think that if they focus on, uh, w- why we're reading the books, you know, it's good literature, there are certain, um, [LIPSMACK] things that you learn from the literature, um, that I think that the censorship thing would sort of go away as opposed to sort of trying to make everything so neutral.
L:  Right, [SIGH] and I don't know, I guess, like, sorta -- this -- it sorta leads to a bigger discussion, l- like what makes a book a classic, or worthy to be on a reading list, you know, and I guess it -- it's just anything that approaches, um, you know, uh, oh, gosh, I guess it's just anything that's -- that -- dealing with a larger issue and -- and anything's that well written and captures, you know, it's -- it's hard to -- to say -- say there's a set criteria for what should be on a list, you know, it's --
R:  Right, right, and, um, that definitely is -- is, um, a problem, if you will, of, uh, coming up with, uh, the list of books.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, because you're right, I mean, you know, it's difficult to say, "Well, you know, why is this book on the list and this book not on the list?"
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, if you think about the list as being sort of [NOISE] representative and then you go out look for books that are well written --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like you said, and deal with certain types of issues, then, um, you know, I think that's sort of a good place to start. [SIGH] And I know that people have sort of complained in recent years that, you know, most of the books that end up on these lists are sort of European slanted or whatever, and it should include, you know, literature from other cultures or [NOISE] whatever --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, which I -- I kind of agree with, but it -- but those books that they include should also meet the criteria --
L:  Right.
R:  -- of good writing, dealing with, you know, certain issues or whatever.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It shouldn't just be included because it's, you know, written by a Japanese author or a African author or a Russian author or whatever.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Um, so, yeah, but, I mean, it's -- I suppose in -- in today's world where nobody wants anybody to sort of lay the rules on for them --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I suppose people sort of, uh, have a knee jerk reaction if they -- when people are told, "You have to read these books".  And I guess that's where people sort of, you know, go in to the teacher and say, [MN] "Well, I don't want my kid to read --"
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  "-- this book" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or whatever.
L:  And, yeah, I think -- I guess it becomes a t- a touchy subject, dealing with, you know younger -- you're -- younger children, because, you know, it's almost, you know, some books are --a re a little too adult for, you know, like, say like a, you know, th- thirteen or fourteen year old, but then, um -- but they're appropriate enough for, like, a seventeen or eighteen year old, I guess. 
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH] I'm trying to think of a good example of a book that's really [SIGH] graphic or, you know, may have sexual content that [SIGH] would give parents plenty of reason to [LAUGH] -- to complain --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but [SIGH] -- but --
R:  Well, I mean --
L:  -- but it's -- also at the same time is a w- a worthy read. [SIGH] You know, that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that becomes a little tricky.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, I guess it does, but I mean that -- that's probably a reason why --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I mean, you don't get to read Henry Miller until you're, like, in your last year of high school or in college.
L:  Right.
R:  But then he's a little bit -- you know, a little bit too edgy.
L:  Yes.
R:  You know, [SIGH] but, um, what I find, because I do have a, um -- a young child, is that, um, there are lots of books that, uh -- like, for instance, I started reading Shakespeare to him --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because you -- if you look around you can finds lots of, um, [LIPSMACK] adaptations of stories and stuff --
L:  R- right.
R:  -- that can -- that g- are geared to a younger, you know, audience so they can still benefit from the good story and that kind of stuff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and I suppose it just takes a little bit of creativity to -- to, um, sort of carry out that list of books that you think by the time somebody leaves high school they should have sort of, you know, been through these number of books or whatever.
L:  Right.  And I think I -- uh, in my experience I -- I -- I think it was good.  Like, I think that I went to college knowing [SIGH] in -- you know, when I reached the f- freshman level [SIGH] English classes in college I was able to -- to keep up and to [SIGH] -- to join in on -- in, you know, conversations because I had had a [SIGH] wide array of literature during high school, which is good and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but I know that I -- in recent years a -- a friend of mine's younger sister, um, wanted to write a report, I think it was a -- a Jack Kerouac book --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and her teacher wouldn't let her -- [MN] wouldn't let her do it because [SIGH] -- uh, and I can't remember the exact reason, but I think it was just [SIGH] that -- that she thought it was, you know, too adult or something.
R:  Right.  No, I mean, p- [MN] I would sort of -- I would have a issue with that teacher.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, because here is a -- a child that has taken whatever was done in the classroom and is able to apply whatever, uh, you know, things she learnt about good literature to something that's completely foreign --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and to me that shows a certain sort of independent thinking --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which I would, you know, encourage.  I'd just make sure -- if -- if I thought the book was adult, I would make sure her parents knew she was reading it or something, I don't --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but I wouldn't necessarily say she couldn't.
L:  Right.
R:  And, you know, it's -- I mean, [MN] I happen to like Kerouac as a writer, you know, which I think, you know, you should at least read, uh, one Jack Kerouac story in your lifetime.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I happen to like him, but, um, the -- and that's -- that's the problem --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- too, I think, with the list, that maybe sometimes [NOISE] people see the list [NOISE] as sort of -- as a limiting thing as opposed to a starting point.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, they tend to say, "Well, you know, uh, it doesn't fit, uh, it's not on the list, so you can't go too far off from the list" or whatever --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which I think is sort of a wrong approach, you -- it -- the list should be a starting point.
L:  Right. [SIGH] 
R:  And -- and you shouldn't really -- I don't think literature --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- should be censored.  That's my basic, um, belief, that literature shouldn't be censored.  I think --
