R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello?
R:  Yes.
L:  Hi, this is Rachel.  Who's this?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Hi, this is Alvin Mack Junior.
L:  Hi.  Um, how are you? What --
R:  I'm w- -- I'm well.
L:  What's your, uh, stance on the topic?
R:  Um, yes, I -- I -- I think that, um, well, in the -- the case of private schools, I feel that they have a right because you're paying for their judgement [MN] --
L:  I think --
R:  -- um --
L:  -- yeah, I don't think that, uh, public schools have a right, 'cause I remember when I was in -- I only went to a public high school, and they, um, had a big issue with us reading things like Catcher in the Rye, and they tried to, you know, ban them, and I thought it was good that we read them.  But I -- I think that, yeah, in -- in the -- in private school, maybe they have more of a right, because people paying -- if the parents say, you know, "We want something banned", then they'll do it.  But --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- in the public school, I don't think they have the right.  I think, you know, what- whatever the teachers want goes.
R:  I agree.  I -- I agree with you.  Where are you located?
L:  I'm in New Jersey.  Where are you?
R:  Oh, I'm in -- I'm in New York City.  I'm in Manhattan --
L:  Oh, right.
R:  -- in the middle of Manhattan.
L:  Did you go to school in Manhattan?
R:  Yes, I did, as a matter of fact.  I went to Friends Seminary --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's a private school.  Um, I went -- and then I went to NYU.
L:  Oh, right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I go to Rutgers at the moment.
R:  [MN] Oh, really?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Well, very good school.
L:  They -- did they have, uh, an issue about this, uh, banning stuff at your high school?  Or at your middle school or whatever?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, uh, no.  I mean, I -- you know, I went to -- I mean, I was fortunate, I -- I got a scholarship, but, um, I was very fortunate.  Um, no, because the tuition is as much as a college [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, my God.
R:  Uh, so [LAUGH] -- so no one was gonna quibble about things like decisions, uh, after they've spent that much money.  I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- mean, I -- you know, I went to, um -- actually, um, I'm -- I'm, uh, separated, but, uh, I, um, I'm sending my daughter there right now as we speak.  And, um, she -- in her class is Michael J. Fox's kid and Susan Sarandon's kid and --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- [MN] you know, and Nixon offspring, and -- so, it's -- it's -- it's that type of school actually.
L:  That's impressive. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah, it's -- it's -- it -- for New York City, it is.  So, if we were in the middle of California, LA, no [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, I -- I know.
R:  Right.
L:  I -- I worked in talent management.  I worked for the [inaudible] agency so I'd see --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- those kind of people all the time, and it's much bigger --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- in LA, [SIGH] so ...
R:  Yeah.  Well, y- you work in what industry?
L:  In, like, um, work for a talent agency.
R:  Oh, a talent agency?  Oh, I see.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wh- what do you do?
L:  Uh, I'm just, like, the floater.  I'm only twenty, so I've just started.
R:  Oh, you're the fl- -- the floater, or the flirter?
L:  The floater.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, I see [LAUGH] [inaudible] okay, pay her to flirt.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.  
L:  We're so gonna go off topic and we're not gonna get paid for this [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, right, okay.  All right --
L:  So --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- what else to say?  What else could we talk about on the topic of censorship?
R:  Um, what -- what books, uh, uh, stayed, um, uh, close to your heart that was possibly, um, [LIPSMACK] controversial?
L:  Um, [MN] there was one -- oh, I don't even remember what we -- what it was called now, but I read it in, like, tenth grade.  It was called native something.  It was about this African American family --
R:  Native Son.  Native Son.
L:  That, yeah.
R:  Right.
L:  [several inaudible words] like, the African American family --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and there was, like, all murders and stuff or something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I remember that was controversial and I just remember reading that.  It was so long ago, so --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Right, right, right.  Well, uh, my father is African American, and my -- my mom is Jewish [LAUGH] --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and so, uh, yeah, I -- I can -- I could relate to that.  And, um, [LIPSMACK] um, and -- and it's interesting, because, um, uh, I'm in my thirties now, but, um, uh, when I was around your age I was modeling from, like, say, like, nineteen to, like, twenty five --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and, um, I sort of -- of felt a lot of, uh, [SIGH] -- I mean, I, you know, obviously I -- I was privileged to a lot of things, but, um, occasionally I would feel a lot of what, um, the main character in Native Son was feeling, as far as -- far as prejudicy.  Um --  
L:  Yeah, so it's a good thing to keep people reading things like that, right? [LAUGH]
R:  It is, it really is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It -- it's -- it's imperative, actually.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, so, um, yeah, as far as censorship and -- how do you feel about -- how do you feel about the press?  Um [MN] --
L:  In what topic [several inaudible words]? [LAUGH]
R:  Well, well, like -- like in, you know, like, say for an example, do you think that for -- for, um, you know, there's the -- the new Division of Homeland Security, right?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, do you feel that there is, uh, there is a need for the press to tell us everything, or should we only be told certain things because of the security of, um, of the nation?
L:  I think that -- actually, I think that they tell us too much.  I think it's good that, you know, they tell us everything [SIGH] and we get a lot of information and we know what's going on, 'cause sometimes you wonder why they're having this war for 'cause you don't know what's going on, [SIGH] but there's a lotta people that could be hearing it, that could be getting, like, tips off it --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- things, so ...
R:  Wow, you feel --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- like they're telling us too much?
L:  Yeah, sometime- -- well, I think some of the things they say --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- like, about, like, new security things --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that they're coming out with, it's, like, didn't tell 'til after they've done it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because, I don't know, some terrorist is, like, you know, living in New -- New Jersey or something and [LAUGH] --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Right.
L:  -- listening to the radio and then they'll know and they'll tell their people back in Iraq or something [SIGH].
R:  Well -- well --
L:  But --
R:  -- do you -- do you feel like the government is -- is, um -- do you feel that the government is censoring what we are absorbing?  In other words, like, even in the [MN] -- because I'm a record producer now --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and even in music, for an example, um, there's a lotta speculation that the government is, in fact, um, [LIPSMACK] uh, [MN] how -- how should I say?  Like, coercing --
L:  Like, shaping how things are told to us?
R:  Right, right --
L:  So --
R:  -- well, well, like --
L:  So we like them [LAUGH] --
R:  Right, well --
L:  -- when we shouldn't?
R:  -- well, I mean, like, for -- [MN] you know, for the fact of the matter is, like, [SIGH] uh, a case in point is, like, rap music.  Okay? [MN] Um, like, it's really -- it's controversial because, um, not all black people are like those rappers, for an example.  And, um, a lot -- lot of the black people are very well educated, and, um, but, um, the fact is, is that -- or like rock --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, a lot of the rock that's being exploited right now, um, is very homogenized.  It's not really controversial, it's not stirring up anything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I think that --
L:  I think -- go ahead. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, what I'm asking is that how do you feel about, um -- do you think that the government, like, is, in fact, like -- because for an example, like crack, for an example, the drug crack is not really, [SIGH] um, like, as prevalent in -- in the more stimulated -- the more intellectually stimulated areas, obviously [SIGH].  And so, but they're peddling these -- these rappers, like Fifty Cent and all these other rappers --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- who are, like, you know, glorifying, like, peddling drugs.  And I'm like, where are they selling this stuff?
L:  [MN]
R:  I don't even see where [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- where -- where are they doing this?  You know?  I mean, it's really funny, and I mean, um --
L:  Yeah, they -- they must be -- I mean, also, you know, over -- how -- I think the government shape things.  I lived in England last year --
R:  Oh, you did?  
L:  -- and -- yeah.
R:  What part?
L:  In Manchester.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've been there --
L:  My -- my fiance's British so --
R:  -- I've been there a lot, I love Manchester.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  It was great.  It was very industrial, but I liked it.
L:  It -- like, it's getting built up a lot, so everything's really modern now, [SIGH] but the thing --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- was, like, all -- I was there during the whole war in Iraq and everything --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and everything came across differently, like, to us in England than it did, like, to my parents at home, you know.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah, they were hating Bush out there.
L:  So, they definitely --
R:  They were totally hating Bush, right?
L:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, it's [inaudible] against, like, everything the Americans did and I think that here it was, like, it was censored so much and, you know, there's -- [several inaudible words] my friend's interning in DC this summer and she's like, "Yeah, everybody's so for Bush", and, like, I can't understand it 'cause everything I heard was, like, horrible.
R:  Uh, ye- -- well --
L:  So --
R:  -- it -- it's funny, because, um, yeah, I -- I -- you know, my -- my girlfriend is from Italy --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and, um, she was telling me something very similar, because she had to go back and forth.  She's a journalist [SIGH] and she had to go back and forth, and she was telling me that, like, it was maddening, because, I mean, [SIGH] you know, she'd read, like, this pro American thing here on e- -- on even, like, you know, Yahoo or anything --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, and then, like, she'd get over there and it was like, you know, a -- like, bombarded, like, with, like, all this anti US stuff, all --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- coming from all the countries out there.  Not, like [SIGH] -- and everyone is still, like, pissed off, if they have half a brain left, that, like, you know, he entered into this war because --
L:  They haven't found anything.
R:  -- they haven't found anything, and they haven't -- you know, and -- and since nine eleven and they were, like, you know, gunning for, uh, Bin Laden, they didn't find Bin Laden, they didn't find Saddam.
L:  [MN] [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, they failed at both --
