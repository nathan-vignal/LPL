R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  How are you?
L:  Good.  How about you?
R:  I'm okay.  Where you from?
L:  Ah, Minnesota.
R:  Minnesota.  I'm from the Bronx, New York.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And my name is Denora.
L:  Hi, I'm Beth.
R:  Hi, Beth, how are you?
L:  Pretty good.  Let's see, I think they said if we should be able to censor stuff in public and private schools.
R:  Right.  Forbid --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Did it say forbid?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Some type of reading in public or private schools?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess the praying -- the prayer um thing that they took out of the public schools --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- has something to do with that, right?
L:  Yeah.  Um, other --
R:  That's a form of --
L:  -- wise I would say I don't think they should be able to censor things.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think they should let anyone ah, you know, read what they want to read --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and do what they want to do.  I mean, we're living in a country that's so diversified, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So many different nationalities and cultures and religions.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think everyone should be having freedom of speech and freedom of religion and freedom of everything.
L:  Right.  I agree with you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I definitely would say the same because it's --
R:  So, what's your experience with this type of -- because I have a school age son, so I'm pretty, you know, that pretty much affects me ah as to -- if they do start forbidding certain materials in school.
L:  Yeah.  Ah, I don't have any kids in school quite yet, but um --
R:  Okay.  Oh, you have a little one?
L:  Yep.  But I remember when I went to school they were talking about um, prob- ah not letting us read certain books.
R:  Wow.  Here in the States?
L:  Because of -- huh?
R:  In the States, here?
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow.
L:  Because of some of the stuff that was in the books.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  So, yeah, um -- so --
R:  I mean, I could see if it was like to protect the children, like if it's sexually explicit material --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- or, you know, something that's ah immoral or, you know, um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- things that are like murder and stuff like that, I could see that, to protect them --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like from viole- you know, violence and sexual explicit material, yes, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- all means to protect the, you know, to create a wholesome environment.
L:  Right.
R:  If it's for that, I -- I could see --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yes, but um for positive things in any kind of way, I don't think they should forbid um, you know, reading at school --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- public schools or private schools.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah and so, you know, the world we're living in today well, all these children are bombarded with so much --
L:  Oh, no kidding.
R:  -- as it is at home --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, in the street they're bombarded with so much --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so, um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they're gonna, you know, they're gonna see it one way or another and it's better they do it in a positive environment --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but they are going to be exposed to some things, whether it be in schools or at home --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or that, you know, geared towards the right, you know, decisions and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the right visions and stuff like that, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, ah, so how old is your little one?
L:  Um, I have two.  I have a three year old girl --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and a two year old boy.
R:  Oh, you're busy.
L:  [LAUGH] Yes.  Well, fortunately they're both napping right now, so it's kind of nice to actually get to talk on the phone.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Last time I wasn't able to get the phone last time they called me, so --
R:  Wow.  Wow.  So, how many calls have you done?
L:  Um, this will be my third.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's good.  It's interesting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  It's very interesting.
L:  I've --
R:  Yeah.  So, um, is there any like objective -- +objectionable material that your kid brings like home to, you know, from school, um, how would you handle things like that if you find some +objectionable material, you know, your point view, in your opinion, if it --
L:  Well, I guess it would, yeah, it would depend on what the stuff was, like if it was um like you were saying before, like murder and stuff like that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, I guess [SIGH] hopefully they wouldn't have to do anything in the beginning of school, you know, like first grade or second grade, because I definitely wouldn't want my children reading that type of material where it would affect that, um, [LIPSMACK] I guess if they're older kids, I guess oh, if it was just a certain line that they were saying, oh let's just say like against gays or lesbians or maybe the color of a person's skin, I said I think I might want them to read it to maybe have them be exposed to those kind of things --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and stuff like that.
R:  Right.  Racism and stuff like that, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So -- yeah, well I know my son brings I -- I'm always in my son's book bag to see what they're doing in school, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to see what type of books they're reading and all that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and the only +objectionable material I found is you know, those ah sorcery books like the Harry Potter books and the um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and the Goosebumps books --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, that goes against you know, our beliefs --
L:  Right.
R:  -- our religious beliefs --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we're not supposed to, you know, believe or dab into that -- that's, you know, white witchcraft, no matter how you look at it, so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- what I do is, you know, "Read it" you know, "Do what you got to do, read it, but remember it's fake, or fiction --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- don't take it to heart, you know, you know we don't believe in that --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- we don't need that" you know, so I think um if the parent is involved, heavily involved in the children's um education and what they're reading that they could have a positive, you know, that will have an impact on what, you know, what the child believes --
L:  Right.
R:  -- even though they have to do what they have to do, like do a book report on a certain book just for the purpose of educational purposes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Then it's okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  But um it's tough, I mean being a parent is a tough thing and, you know, shielding your children from certain things is hard and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- shielding your kids from school shouldn't be something we have to do --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  You know?  I mean, we should send our kids to school and not worry about that they're going to be exposed to, you know, objectionable material --
L:  Right.  Yeah, I agree with you.  Being ah involved in the kids' schooling sure would -- does help a lot because yeah it's amazing what kids learn in school and I think, yeah, I should be involved [several inaudible words] possible what you can --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, either helping the student with the -- the work that are being involved in, or even helping ah maybe the teachers and you know as parent teachers and stuff like that --
R:  Right.  Be involved.  Be in your kids' book bag.  If you can't get involved, because I can't really be too involved because I'm a full time student and a full time employee --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so I won't -- I already have a v- a pretty tight schedule --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but the way I do it is I look at my son, my son -- my son falls asleep, I look in his book bag.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Through his notes, through his notebook --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to see what he's, you know, learning and to see how he's writing and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, so and if anything -- I find a little, you know, question on it, I just, you know, when he wakes up in the morning, very casually, I ask him --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, about certain things, to see how he gets his feedback from what, you know, what he ah perceives from the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- lesson or from the book or from whatever he was exposed to.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I mean it takes very little effort, but it could be done.  You know, it could be done.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  It could be done.  So, ah, [SIGH] it is very interesting though.  This ah study thing.  Um, and this is the longest eight minutes --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Right?  Doesn't it seem kinda long.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Where are you originally from, because you have like a -- like an European accent?
L:  No, from Minnesota most of my life.
R:  From Minnesota?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow.
L:  Um, then North Dakota for a couple of years there, but Minnesota's pretty much my --
R:  So they all -- so you all talk out there like that, with that accent?
L:  Oh, I guess.  It just depends on what -- where you are from in Minnesota.
R:  Right.
L:  Most have more of a [LIPSMACK] oh, if you're up further north --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- or maybe you're towards the west, more toward --
R:  Right.
L:  -- North Dakota, then we'll have like a [LIPSMACK] oh, I want to say like a yeeha kind of thing, but I don't know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Just depends on what -- what dialect, I guess, you use to --
R:  Right.  Right.  Wow, it's interesting.
L:  But no -- no European.  Huh-uh.
R:  No European.
L:  No.
R:  Oh okay.  That's interes- --
L:  Not that I wouldn't mind be from there, but --
R:  Oh, yeah, well none of us --
L:  -- I mean [LAUGH].
R:  -- we lo- we all love that accent, you know?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] We all love that accent.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  So, you always lived in Minnesota?
L:  Huh?
R:  You -- have you always lived in Minnesota?
L:  Most of my life, um, my parent when I was young, my parents, we traveled a little bit, but not a whole lot, but um --
R:  Right.  How's the weather out there?  It's cold ah --
L:  Oh, it's actually pretty nice today.  We're supposed to get rain, but I don't think it's going to hit us today.
R:  Right. Right.
L:  Well, it's seventy five, probably.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, it's ninety out here, ninety two to be except.
L:  Holy cow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you know we were like that the last couple of days, we were hot and sticky and the humidity was pretty bad.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Us too --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, they said that that cold front's supposed to be ah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- coming over here by Friday, when ah --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- yeah, we're going to get like seventy degree weather on Friday.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I guess it's a cold front that's coming out, you know, you know, further out in the middle than we are, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it's heading this way, the cold front, so --
L:  Yeah.  But our fourth of July was sure was nice.
R:  Yeah, it was beautiful.
L:  That was nice.
R:  Yeah.  It was hot, though.  It was pretty hot, yeah.
L:  Yes, it was.  Yeah, we had tornado watches the day before.
R:  Wow.
L:  And stuff like that, so --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- and that wasn't very fun.
R:  And you guys get a lot of snow too, right?
L:  You know, actually we haven't had a whole lot of snow this last y- --
R:  Really?
L:  -- the last couple of years.
R:  Really?
L:  I mean, we had -- we've had it, yeah, but not as much as we've had in the past.
R:  Right.
L:  So --
R:  Of course New York are bombarded, we were bombarded with snowstorms this year.
L:  Well, yeah, I heard that in the news.
R:  Yeah, it's horrible.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Horrible, yeah.  And we're not used to that.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Probably not.
R:  Yeah.  No, we're not.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, we were ill prepared for, you know, this winter --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah --
R:  And it was kind of r- it was kind of rough.
L:  [several inaudible words] the snow here [LAUGH].
R:  Wow.  I thought you guys got more snow than we did.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Yeah.  For some reason.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But you guys m- o- up north more.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I r- like um our western cities --
R:  Iowa somewhere?
L:  -- the city of Minneapolis --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and St. Paul.
R:  Okay.
L:  Ah --
R:  Mm.  So, is it beautiful out there?
L:  Yeah, it's pretty nice.  Um, we're kind of suburbs, so we're not too bombarded with traffic or anything like that --
R:  Right.  I'm in the heart of the city.
L:  Oh, geeze.
R:  I'm a city girl.
L:  Do you -- no thank you [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I'm a city girl.  So, I'm used to the rat race and the rushing and the pushing --
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  -- and the -- and all that good stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  My husband doesn't like that, so --
R:  Yeah, no, u- uh.  So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you'd rather have suburban living, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  And I think things are more wholesome out there also --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, getting back to the topic of ah forbiddens in school, whatever, forbidden material --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I -- I ah perceive it as more whole, you know, wholesome for kids as --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- better for kids to live out there in the suburbs than it is for the city for some reason, I don't know.  That is just, you know, a misconception on my part.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yep, yep, yep, yeah.  You have been a very, really l- longest eight minutes, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  As a matter of fact, it --
L:  Usually it's walk in, ten minutes, we're out.
