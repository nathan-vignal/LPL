R:  Hi, this is Kathy.
L:  Hi Kathy.  I'm Joan.
R:  How are you today?
L:  I'm fine thank you.  How are you?
R:  I'm having so much fun, I can't stand it.
L:  [LAUGH]  Well, I need some of that.
R:  I'm at work.
L:  Oh.  You can talk while you're at work?
R:  Until somebody comes in, then I'll have to put the phone down.
L:  Oh.  Okay.
R:  So, where are you -- where are you at?
L:  Ah Louisiana [several inaudible words] --
R:  Oh, I'm in Virginia.
L:  Virginia.  What part?
R:  Outside, in Charlottesville.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, what do you think of censorsip- -ship in the schools?
L:  Um, I didn't quite understand all they said.  I heard censorship about books and private and public --
R:  [inaudible] do private and public schools --
L:  It just said --
R:  -- about censorship or them reading -- reading books --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and material.
L:  Okay.  But that's what it was, censoring --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- particular ah books in private or public --
R:  Yeah, I guess book burnings.
L:  What's that?
R:  Book burnings, like they did back in the fifties.
L:  Book burnings?
R:  Yeah.  They were burning a lot of the old poets and the old masters because they said they were nasty and they shouldn't read them in school.
L:  Um.  Ah, first of all, I think private schools can do what they want -- 
R:  I think --
L:  I mean, as long as, you know, the students are performing, you know, the way that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the school district or whatever wants them to perform, now in -- in -- in public schools um I mean they have to use discretion, you know, um [NOISE] I know there's a difference between discretion and censorship, but I think sometimes um people lump it all under censorship, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um I mean I, you know, I wouldn't want my kids reading about witches or warlocks or magic or, you know, having to read, I don't know, about Satanism or um being forced -- being forced to read something, you know [NOISE].
R:  Yeah, I don't think we can censor anything, but that's my own personal thought.
L:  You don't think that the school districts can?
R:  I don't think they should.  It should be left up to the parents.  If you don't want your child to read it, they don't read it.
L:  Well, what -- what about age inappropriate material?
R:  My kids are grown, my grandkids are in school.  I have no problem with that, my granddaughter, my daughter didn't want my d- granddaughter to read something at thirteen, she didn't read it.  They gave her something else to read. [PAUSE]
L:  Hm. [PAUSE]
R:  My daughter's thir- my granddaughter's thirteen, she's in advanced classes, she can understand things older.  I don't think we have the right to censorship in schools. [PAUSE]
L:  So, I mean you felt --
R:  I was a child during the book burnings d- in the fifties.  I don't agree with it.  They burned Tom Sawyer [PAUSE] --
L:  Well, no, I -- I wouldn't agree with stuff like that, ah um ah I just think there is certain -- I mean like say if it were sexual in nature, you know, I wouldn't want my kids reading it.  You know, um [PAUSE] I mean, how do you feel about that?
R:  It depends on what the age is and what they can handle.  If they c- d- you don't want them to have it, you have the right to censor it, the schools don't.
L:  You have a point there.  Um, what if you don't know your kid's reading it?  Then what would you do?  I mean, if you found out later, you know.
R:  When my kids were in school, I knew everything they brought home and everything they read.  I know what my grandkids are reading.  I am that aware of what they're doing.
L:  What if it -- what if it was something that they were doing just in class and you didn't know about it?
R:  There's not anything my kids did or my grandkids that I don't know they do in class.  My kid -- grandkid -- my kids and my grandkids are very open what -- about what they were doing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [PAUSE] And did they, you know, nothing was secretive.  My k- my kids to this -- my son's thirty one, my daughter's thirty three and I know everything.  You know, they're that comfortable with telling me.
L:  Yeah, well, I mean, that's good.  I -- I'm just wondering, you know, speaking about censorship if you know the did something in class that, you know, say was in an class project and --
R:  Your school doesn't tell you what your projects are ahead of time?
L:  Well, I just --
R:  Ours do.
L:  -- ah -- I have one in high school and then one just about to start first grade, so I don't know, as far as my high schooler, he doesn't tell me anything, you know.
R:  Yes.  See, my kids always told me everything and we always got things at the beginning of the nine weeks, a synopsis for the nine weeks.
L:  Really?  That's good.  Yeah, so I mean, I feel like I'm kind of out of the loop as far as one in high school that doesn't talk to me and then, you know, one about to start first grade, so --
R:  [LAUGH] I -- I don't know, my -- my -- my son is -- will be thirty one in I mean he doesn't live at home, but he's home four nights a week and I mean I know stuff about his friends and stuff that they -- they all do that, Lord I wish he wouldn't tell me, but I know it.  But they've always been like that with me.
L:  that's good that they're open.  I just, you know, as far as censorship goes, you know --
R:  You know and they -- they were, you know, when they were in school, if there was something that came up that wasn't -- that was in the synopsis they didn't want to do, they had the right to call me.
L:  That's good.  That's good.  You know, but I w- I -- you know, I -- I think I agree more with your point because I would hate seeing the -- if one -- I think once you start censoring something um that --
R:  It kind of bad --
L:  -- it can go overboard.
R:  Did you ever see the movie um "Footloose"?
L:  No.  Well, yes, yes, I did.  Yes, I did.
R:  Because that was like censorship of dance and then they had a book burning and everything and stuff in there and ah like that, you know, they were censoring the old masters and that's kind of like what went on.  I -- I'm from up north and that kind of went on like up in Boston and up in where I was from and stuff during the fifties.
L:  Hm.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.  I guess.
R:  And I wouldn't want that to happen, no, I wouldn't -- my kids -- I mean, my son has read Dante, Inferno, everything, since he was probably about thirteen, fourteen years old.  He, you know, he's a voracious reader, he reads everything.  And he asks questions, too.  So, I -- I never wanted him -- I think that's what, you know, made him w- where he is and what he's doing today.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, my kids are very articulate and very well read.  And I have never wanted them censored.  My -- my parents didn't censor me.
L:  Yeah.  I think --
R:  If they, you know, if they didn't want me to read it, then fine, I didn't read it.  But if I brought it in, I showed it to them, we talked about.  If, you know, my mother looked at it, read it, if she thought it, you know, I should read it, then I could read it.  If she thought no, she censored it, but no one else did.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's more my concern, once you start censoring, you know, it's um then -- then it can go overboard.  
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  I mean, like I said, something sexual or something like that, I wouldn't want my kids reading, but I -- I guess if we had the option like you have had to look at it first --
R:  Just like --
L:  -- that's different.
R:  -- w- with the Harry Potter books, my granddaughter loves them.  I read every one of them before I let her read them.
L:  Really?
R:  Yes.  She wanted to read them, I said, "Well, let me check them out". [PAUSE] She lived with me at the time, all three of my grandkids did, so I just read them and then, "Okay, you can read them".
L:  Mm.
R:  But she knows they're fantasy, too.  She knows it's a book.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  It's a fiction, fantasy book.  It's not reality.  She under -- she, you know, can tell the difference between the two and that's fine.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] Um [PAUSE] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Well, I -- I'm not real decided totally where I am on the issue.  I just know that it's like one -- one -- girls, stop it. [NOISE] Excuse me, my kids are fighting.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, ah --
R:  I'll lose my patience for it [LAUGH].
L:  [NOISE] Um, you know, once they start censoring, it can go overboard [NOISE] but then again I would hate for somebody sneakily to [NOISE] you know, just sneak something in there and [NOISE] to push their viewpoint too [NOISE].
R:  That's ah -- I'm --
L:  So --
R:  My kids have always been --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, opinionated and you know what they want and what they don't want and, you know pretty much what, you know, and what they didn't want or they what considered smut or what they didn't like or the nasty, they didn't do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But they've always been told, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if it's something you don't want to do, or you don't like, you need to call me.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [PAUSE] There's a thing going on up here now about what is it, things on t shirts.
L:  It's what?
R:  Slogans and stuff on t shirts.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Someone came in to school the other day with one with the NRA on it and a gun and someone's sitting there crouching with a gun --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- and they made to g- they suspended the kid --
L:  [NOISE] They did -- they suspended him?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Well, hold on.  L- let her have it.  I'm on the phone and I cannot hear.  [NOISE] Stop it.  Just a few more minutes [NOISE]. Just a few minutes.  Ooh.
R:  Are they -- they -- it was like a sixth grader.
L:  Huh?
R:  And it was like the last week of school and they suspended him --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- for wearing the t shirt because, what was it?
