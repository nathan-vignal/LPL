L:  Hello.  My name is Katrina.
R:  Hi.  Lisa.
L:  Hi, Lisa.
R:  How are you?
L:  Good, how are you?
R:  Pretty good.
L:  That's good.
R:  What was the topic?
L:  About whether or not schools should um be able to censor what books the children read.
R:  Oh, they said "censor".
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh --
L:  It w- you had to b- it was a quickie [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  I didn't -- I -- I thought they said um decide what books they should read, they said --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- censor what books they should read --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um --
L:  -- which --
R:  I mean I guess I- I think it would depend on w- why they were censoring it.
L:  Right.
R:  [MN]
L:  To a -- I think to a certain extent there should be some guidelines as far as what is there --
R:  I mean, does that mean -- does that mean they wouldn't allow them to read certain books, because I mean a kid can go to the library and get whatever book they want.
L:  Right.
R:  So --
L:  But as far as like in English class they won't offer --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- a, you know, whatever I think now they don't even read Catcher in the Rye anymore, I'm not sure.
R:  I guess I think it would um --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it would depend, in my opinion, I guess it would depend on why they were censoring it.  I mean, the whole issue of um censoring like gay --
L:  Mhm.
R:   -- um type of things is kind of touchy because in -- in my opinion I don't want my daughter to hate gay people --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, and if she has gay people in her family -- think almost everybody does -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, so I wouldn't want her to hate gay people --
L:  Right.
R:  -- by the same token, I don't know if I want her, at eleven, you know, reading a book about --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [LAUGH]
L:  Well, my daughter's eleven also and --
R:  Oh.  Okay.  Cool.
L:  -- I think if -- if the book is um -- how do I want to say -- I don't want her to learn anything new, but they're going to learn about it anyway --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so if they can do it through school and learn it the right way, which goes back to like instead of people saying you hate this person or you don't like that, or they're different and stuff --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but if the book can do it in such a way where, hey, just because you're different doesn't mean you're not okay.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.
R:  I mean, they have a lot -- they have like some books like that that they're putting in the curriculum and also showing like same sex couples and certain books --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I don't know, I hate to say it, I -- I feel -- I do feel a little funny about it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like it's like --
L:  The sexual part of that, I think, I don't -- well, there again, they're going to hear about it anyway --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but --
R:  I'm not sure I trust the schools enough to say that they should or shouldn't censor anything, to be honest.
L:  Yeah.  I agree.  I agree.
R:  I mean, I've decided I'm going to home school my daughter next year --
L:  Oh, you are?
R:  Yeah.  Because um this year um September, October she had to ri- her regular teacher who everyone said was a great teacher and then she got sick and she was gone for six months --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- and they had like no less than ten different substitutes.
L:  Oh boy.  Yeah.
R:  You know, so --
L:  Yeah, we're in a very small school district up here and um most of any exposure she would get would be through the school to any, you know, topic --
R:  Mhm.  Right.
L:  -- but um I would rather be the one explaining it.
R:  Right.
L:  As far as like um sticky issues --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but um I think if you explain to them that it's a story, you know, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I don't know.
R:  It's a little hard, right?
L:  Yeah.  It is.  I mean, if it's history, that's one thing.  If it's fact that actually happened then, you know, but as far as um to read a story about certain things -- especially if it has sexual overtones to it -- I definitely would say no.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, I don't -- I don't think the schools would put something like that, but even like um I w- I was reading something and they had like, you know, like sort of like Johnny has two dads --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- or something like that and it --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it doesn't touch on the sexual aspect of it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but it definitely touches on the --
L:  There's even some --
R:  -- fact that they're a couple.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, and it's like --
L:  I've not seen that one [LAUGH].
R:  It's [inaudible] trying to explain that to kids is like --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- okay -- I mean, my daughter, she knows what it is because um her aunt, you know, and she says to me --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- she's like, "Well, is it wrong?" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, and if you're Christian, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Christians believe that it is wrong --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but if you love your sister, it's like --
L:  It's acceptable.
R:  It's hard [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  I bet.
R:  It was hard to say, "Oh, they're wrong, they're wrong --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- they're totally wrong", especially when all her life she's been so unhappy and now she's happy.
L:  See, yeah --
R:  And she has a great life and they have a house and two cars --
L:  Great.
R:  -- and they're doing so good and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- wow, how do you explain --
L:  Yeah.  And that's what we try to just do the um --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- um, live and let live --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- nobody's telling me what -- how to live my life and I'm not going to tell anyone how to do --
R:  Right.
L:  -- how they should.  Yeah.  So, I think you get a better breed of people with that attitude, instead of teaching people to tell everyone they're wrong --
R:  Right.  Judging --
L:  -- you know -- I really think that's the best way.  Even though like even here we don't run into a whole lot of issues --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I have a cousin who's gay, but my daughter probably wouldn't know him if she tripped over him on the street --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- we correspond by the mail and whatnot, telephone, so she wouldn't even --
R:  Right.
L:  -- recognize him, but I mean I know it's out there and I know people are, you know, but [MN] as far as that goes, I think I'm the person to explain it to her, not the school.
R:  Right.  I -- I think so too.
L:  Yeah.  Because they're going to do what they're told.
R:  The schools?
L:  Yeah.  As far as what books and --
R:  What's in the curriculum.
L:  Correct.  Right.  So -- and they might do it in a way where u- and not only that, when it comes from the parent they tend to understand a little bit better because the parent knows how to talk to them.
R:  Right.  And um plus -- well, I think I said that already, I'm not really sure, that um, that I'm sure -- I'm not really sure that the school has my best interests at heart --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because they've first [inaudible] they've followed --
L:  Or even the State, for that matter.
R:  Huh?
L:  Or even the State to decide --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what books --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- are --
R:  Because they followed their curriculum for years and years and years --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and even now some of the books are still wrong --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- about certain things that have happened in history and they've not had any real change in the past twenty years --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in how some of history is written, knowing that some of that stuff is absolutely not true, they still keep it that way.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, they're just starting to say, "Okay, okay, okay.  Christopher Columbus didn't discover America" --
L:  Right.  Right.  Right.
R:  You know? They're just starting to say that like the past --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- two years.
L:  Yeah.  It makes you wonder.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, about -- well, like we said, about the selection and how things are going to be told --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it would explain, yeah [MN].
R:  Right.
L:  So, to a point I think hm, I don't know how they would --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- do it.  I mean, I don't know how they would decide, I think --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- sometimes leave us alone and fix what you've already got going --
R:  Right.
L:  -- before you add something else.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I think -- I don't think that I've um -- I don't know, still -- still the question -- I know we're probably going to get cut off soon --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but I [LAUGH] still I think the -- the question's a little weird to me because it's like if the school has a curriculum um, who are they censoring, are they censoring themselves or are they censoring a student who chooses a certain book?
L:  I see.  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  You know what I mean?  That -- that's what --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'm curious about in the question.
L:  Right.
R:  Is like if a student picks a certain book, are they censoring --
L:  Are they saying, "No, you can't have that one?" --
R:  Because, yeah, I do remember like the whole Christopher Columbus thing is a sore spot with me, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, I remember when my daughter was in like the first or second grade she told her teacher, "That's not true" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, "My mother told me that such and such and such" and she got in a lot of trouble for that --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and her teacher, you know, she got in trouble that day and her teacher sent home a really nasty note and I went to school and it was a big thing --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- but it's like is that what they mean by censorship as far as like the student being able to say, "Well, I want to write about this book"?
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  If that's the case, I don't think it should be censored --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and then you say, "Well, what about the kid that comes to school and writes a book on Hitler" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, does a book on Hitler --
L:  Right.
R:  -- then should it be censored then?
L:  Right.
R:  So --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it's -- I think it's a hard decision --
L:  Yeah, the -- maybe the question should have been a little bit more specific --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know?
R:  I mean, we wouldn't like it if a kid did a book report on Mein Kampf --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but should we tell him that he can't do it because now we're talking about free speech.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that's definitely something I believe shouldn't be messed with at all.
L:  Right.  Exactly.
R:  Regardless to how much it's -- how hard it is for us to stomach it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if you mess with it at all --
L:  Because if they have the will to learn about something --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- then I think, go for it.  Even if I don't agree with the subject matter --
R:  Right.
L:  -- if you have the -- the gumption to research it and get the facts and whatnot --
R:  Right.
L:  -- then yeah, by all means, yeah.
R:  Right.
L:  Although I don't think they should have bomb building books
