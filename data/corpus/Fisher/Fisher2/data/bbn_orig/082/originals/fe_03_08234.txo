R:  Hi, my name is Susan.
L:  I'm Nicole.
R:  Hi.
L:  Did she say um that they're required to read certain books or restricted from reading certain books?
R:  I think she said require, I think.  I got static on my cellphone, so I think -- I mean on my cordless phone --
L:  I couldn't tell.  I was going to say, well I can understand why they would have like required reading, you know, for like, I don't know, English Lit or something like that so that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they could participate and discuss it, you know [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.  I think -- I --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I think she said, yeah, require, I'm not sure.  I'm not sure whi- which it was.  I know I -- I attend a private school, so I thought it's kind of different with private and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- public schools, things are really different --
L:  Right.  I think --
R:  Um --
L:  There are -- as long as there -- I don't know, you know, um, I know that maybe some people might w- not want their kids to read certain books because of religious preferences and stuff like that, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, unless it's something I think that maybe it's too mature for them, I don't -- or, you know, I don't know, something beyond their age or something, I -- I think I'm pretty much cool with whatever the -- so far, whatever they've chosen.  My kids are little, so --
R:  Yeah.  I don't believe in, yeah, there should be censorship in what they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, you know, to -- within limits, yeah.
L:  Sure, yeah.
R:  You know, because I remember, like I said, I was in private school when I was younger and I've -- I read Charlotte's Web.  I mean, that has nothing to do with religion, that was in a --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it was in a private Christian school --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so, you know, it wasn't like it was totally, you know, and I think they said private and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- did they say public schools, too?  Or they just addressing -- I'm pretty sure --
L:  I think she said both.  I -- I um, I loved Charlotte's Web. [LAUGH]
R:  Huh?
L:  I said, I loved Charlotte's Web [LAUGH].
R:  Ah, the -- ah that was like, my kids watched the movie, I was like, "I'm too old, I can't watch the movie" I don't think there was a movie.
L:  Yeah.  It's -- yeah, it's wonderful.  I love it.  Do you know, we um ah -- what was I going to -- um, I think, I remember being in high school, I think it was like a freshman or sophomore and we read Lord of the Flies --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and that one I -- I found really disturbing, it really bothered me, even ah Nineteen Eighty Four by George Orwell --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that one bothered me too and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- um it -- I don't think it was -- I don't think that it maturity wi- it was just, it was -- it covered topics that if I, even now, if -- if ah I was going to read a book and I knew it was about stuff like that, I probably wouldn't read it, but it -- it's more like preference stuff, does that make s- do you know what I mean?
R:  Right.  W- w- I know what I've heard just kind of briefly, I've c- ah people saying that there is some schools in different areas that are trying to and I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I'm not even sure which books it is, you know, what category it falls into, that they're try- --
L:  Harry Potter.  For instance.  Some, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I know Harry Potter's one -- is getting a bad -- is getting a bad rep.  I'm in Florida and um it's kind of um -- I'm in the upper, the pan handle part where [several inaudible words] it's the redneck Riveria, you know the joke?
R:  Yeah.
L:  As they call it here.  But um --
R:  I'm in Georgia, so I know.
L:  Okay, see.  You're my neighbor, so you're -- it's that -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and the people like, "Oh no, it's about magic, we're not, you know, you can't read it, we don't want anybody reading it and we don't want it discussed in schools" they are doing that here.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's -- I -- I've kind of had those with ah parents that ah, say my neighbors or parents of, you know, my children's friends, because I have one son and he does like it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and um I don't have a problem with it, you know, but I know s- maybe some schools do, maybe there is parts you could --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, like kind of vary on --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- maybe you could.
L:  Sure.  Sure.  Yeah.  I -- I'm s- um, I know I -- I haven't heard of the -- I'm -- I've just read an article like oh in a magazine that um when I was at a doctor's appointment, sitting in the waiting room --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and --
R:  That's the best reading, isn't it?
L:  I know.  I know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It was free.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But it dis- discu- there was a long with the books and like um um Huckleberry Finn and several other books were on this list that this one group of mothers a- at the PT- you know, PTA moms of this school --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it was like in the mid west who um were trying to get banned from the library, the school library, they didn't want their kids reading it anything like that and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I though, "My God.  Huckleberry Finn", you know, "Wow" you know, "God" kind of like they're --
R:  Um --
L:  -- blaming, you know, they blame television and they blame reading and stuff on the problems that children have today.  You know, they should --
R:  But I wonder what facts they actually base that on.
L:  I, you know, I don't think they're based on facts.
R:  No.
L:  I think it's probably easier to do that than ah look inward and see maybe, you know, maybe --
R:  Yeah.  Because I think you -- that has, you know, God, they can't hardly get kids to -- a- we're just thinking about the South and I hate to say it, but I think the South has a really, you know, low rate of children reading books and stuff at early ages, I think they -- I think they said there was actually some kind of, you know, survey they did that showed that it was lower --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and that they were having, I -- I know in Georgia I think there was.  I think there was a thing where they were having a campaign --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, because kids just wasn't reading at all.
L:  Right.  Do you know --
R:  They're not wanting to read at all.
L:  Here in Florida they have a thing, um, it's called the FCAT and my son goes to public school, but it's a charter school --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and we'd had him in a Catholic school for a couple of years and I -- we just didn't like the te- it was the teacher we didn't like [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so we moved him over to this charter school and um [SIGH] the -- like public school kids take in certain grades, um, third and I think third and fourth and sixth, I'm not sure exactly when, they take um this test called the FCAT --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they um ah do um, what do you call it?  If they -- if they fail it, they have to repeat and so like say you're ge- you could be a straight A student and if you're a senior in high school and you um, ah, fail the FCAT, you don't get a diploma.
R:  Mm.
L:  It's -- I mean, it's, you know, it's ah -- I mean granted I know that's not about censorship, but, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- wow, we don't even [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you would thank God that they would push, "Read all the books you can, it doesn't matter what they're about, read, read, read" you know, "Just, you know, stimulate your mind" or something.  I don't know.  You know.
R:  Yeah.  I could understand if they were bringing something really graphic or into it, but you know, my ah -- you know, I have four children, I have one as a teenager --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- so for a lot of, pretty good many years I've been seeing the libraries at school for instance -- and my kids are all in private school, I mean public school -- --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I'm really seeing the -- the whole scope of it, you know, and --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- it's never -- I've never seen anything that I personally thought was -- should be censored, I don't think.
L:  I haven't either.  That -- I haven't seen -- I mean, even Lord of the Flies, even though I didn't like or --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- Nineteen Eighty Four, I didn't like it, but I certainly don't think that it's, I don't know, that I have any place telling somebody else, "No, you can't read that" --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know?  Forget it.  You know?  I -- I'd be really upset.
R:  Yeah.  I don't --
L:  God.
R:  -- I mean, most of the trouble, I'd say by the time they get to teens, troubled teens, I don't think I've ever noticed any that were --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, the -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- specifically they said [LAUGH].
L:  Sure.
R:  You know?
L:  Oh, yeah, you know, the Columbine, yeah, the kids, you know, s- went and shot up the school because of bad books or [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.  Or, you know, down -- down here in -- in Georgia --
L:  They saw it on TV.  Where are your parents? [LAUGH]
R:  Usually it's -- usually, actually the topic is usually something about bullies, it has nothing to do with reading.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know?  It has nothing to do with censorship or -- of what you read or whatever --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it has -- I know it -- my kids down here in public school, especially middle and high school, they do do with -- with the clothing, you know, with the shirts, you can't have certain things on your shirts and stu- --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but just the books you read or the -- the g- you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the um, [PAUSE] -- you know --
L:  Gosh.  Right.
R:  It's b- we live in a very um we live, you know, suburban [LAUGH] like kind of rural, almost, area, so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's not -- it's -- it's pretty conservative [inaudible] but it's not real bad.  I've never known anybody to have real bad problems.
L:  Me neither.
R:  Over the years with the -- the different PTA meetings and stuff.  I've never --
L:  This is ah -- yeah, me neither, just -- it seems, you know, I -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I -- up in Panama City, I mean, you know they [LAUGH] I was going to say --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, they're still hunting down the girls gone wild people, you know [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they have their car and they have their plane and, you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- they want more, you know, and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you -- I don't know, you -- this is, you know, spring break, h- central here and um --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- but, you kn- but, you know, they're strict about stuff like that, you know, but I -- I never hear anything about them censoring anything.  There's actually um -- um, a billboard when you're driving on one of the main ah streets here in town and it's um --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- p- it's from the gas company and it's of a man showering --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and no they don't show, you know, his bottom, or his genitals or anything like that, but they show quite a bit of him.  They show a lot of skin --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- on that thing and I, you know, you would think this area that is against girls gone wild would be -- wouldn't be cool about something like that, but it's been there for a year.
R:  [MN]
L:  That same billboard.  So, I don't know, it's [LAUGH].
R:  So, it's staying.  It's not going +probably.
L:  I know [LAUGH].
R:  You would -- you would think though, yeah.
L:  I know.  You would think if they'd have a problem with the girls gone wild thing that they'd have a problem with that, but apparently not.  I don't know.  I don't know why, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they don't.  So, I -- I definitely don't think they do any censorship here or anything, you know, any extremes because I think we would have heard about it by now.
R:  No.  And some of these books that we're mentioning come with the -- I'm sure you have them too -- the book fairs, the scholas-
