L:  Hello.  I'm Ben.
R:  Hi.  My name's Antonio.  Um, you can call me Toni if you want [LAUGH].  Um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  So we have to talk about censorship.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, um, I -- I think that, uh, public schools have to be very careful about the censoring and -- and about forbidding people from reading books.  I don't know about private schools.  That's a different matter.  Um, but I mean, a public school is like it's -- it's -- it's funded by the government and I mean, wh -- when it censors it -- it-- it restricts speech, you know.
R:  I guess.  I guess, it -- it depends on what exactly is being censored like --
L:  Yeah, that's true because -- because obscenity's not --
R:  Exactly.
L:  Right.  But -- but I mean, you have to be very careful when dealing with stuff that's -- that's, you know, either directly or sort of subtlety politic, you know.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Um, but d- definitely, um, when -- when there's obscenity and it's just like pure obscenity, like, if it's like -- if it's just sort of, like, something that's not really -- it has no artistic or ideological value, then I think you can -- I think you can discard it and you can forbid it.  I mean, at -- at -- at least in sort of elementary schools and like, you know, maybe -- maybe junior high schools and I mean, possible in high -- I mean, I -- I -- I think in -- in -- in universities nothing should be censored because you --
R:  Well, true.
L:  I mean, 'cause you have no, um -- you have no reason to -- to ever censor anything in -- in a university.  I mean, I'm -- I'm a college student and I -- I -- I think the idea -- I mean, obviously it's not -- I -- I -- I don't think that -- that -- that everything should be studied but if you have a -- a college professor, you know, who --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- who has a doctorate and who knows what they are doing, I don't think there should be any reason why -- why the state should ever have to intervene.
R:  Yeah, I -- I -- I agree with that.  It just like -- in -- in like anything like three -- even like high school --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think like if it's not relevant to like what they're learning about --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there really isn't any reason to have something that -- that's not -- like, not educational.
L:  Uh-huh.  But like -- like don't you think that -- that -- that what the -- like the definition of educational, don't you think that's pretty broad?  I mean, c- couldn't you argue that lots of things are educational?  I mean, you could say that -- that -- that reading -- I mean, because like what -- what really is -- is education?  I mean, isn't it [MN] -- I --I mean, is- isn't it taking in lots and lots of -- and -- and different -- different points of view and perspectives and widening the mind?  So --
R:  Well --
L:  Yeah.
R:  If that's -- well, I kinda mean like if it's not geared to what they're learning about, like at that time.
L:  Mhm.  So -- so then like -- like if -- if something is like directly relevant --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- then -- then it -- it could be permissible but if it has no -- right, so -- s- s- so then you're saying that -- that then it would -- it would like follow what the curriculum is.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And, therefore, like -- like since the curriculum would be decided upon -- yeah, but then -- then like you don't allow the teacher any -- any free room, do you?  I mean, like then the teacher has to teach exactly what the curriculum is and --
R:  well, they could --
L:  -- I mean like --
R:  -- choose whatever they -- they wished the -- the -- the children to read --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but just as long as the kind of -- has to -- it kind of likes corresponds with what they're -- what they're teaching them at the time.
L:  Uh-huh.  And -- and what they're teaching them at the time is -- is decided upon by whom?  By -- by national authorities or by like state authorities or?
R:  No, I just like mean like the -- like -- kind of like the -- if they were teaching about different genres like if they're teaching about like mystery novels --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like they don't -- like shouldn't have the right to say what mystery novels --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but like the teacher could like --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- figure out what they want to work with.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I -- yeah, that's -- that's true and then, like, in private schools?
R:  I really don't know anything [LAUGH] about private schools.  I've been a public school kid my whole life [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, yeah me too except for now [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  But I mean, like -- like I -- I guess if -- if people are sending their children to -- to private schools, then -- then they want the private school to teach something very specific, right?  I mean, like -- like you don't send your kid to -- to -- to a Catholic school because you want them to be reading anti Catholic literature, you know.  I mean, you-- you --
R:  True.
L:  -- so -- so I mean like I -- I kind of feel like a private school should be allowed to do whatever it wants as long as it doesn't violate any, you know, basic laws about like, you know, obviously the private schools can't like beat the children and they can't -- they can't starve the children and they have to provide a certain base level of education, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like they have to -- they have to meet certain like, I guess the word is like, a standard, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But like other than that, I don't see any reason why -- why a private school should -- should not be allowed to -- to forbid and pick the books -- I mean, to -- to forbid and choose the books that it wants to choose, you know.
R:  Exactly.
L:  So, I guess the real question is with -- with public schools like who -- who gets to decide whether a book is obscene, you know.
R:  See that's where I think that like the id- the ideal thing to solve all of the -- the controversy about --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what they pick and what they don't pick --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is they should -- they should have it like required by the teachers before the school year to give the parents like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a listing of what they would -- would like the children to be reading and have the parents decide.
L:  Uh-huh, and so the parents would decide by -- by a vote or -- or -- or by like an opting in, opting out?
R:  I guess it would be like --
L:  Because then the problem is like -- like a lot -- a lot of parents -- a lot of parents, I mean like -- like they -- they don't know what -- what certain works are.  Like if you say to a parent, you know, we're -- we're gonna read, you know, Art in a Cup, you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [LAUGH] or we're gonna read, you know, the Writer in America.  I'm just looking at books on -- on my book shelf.  You know, we're -- you know, we're gonna read, you know, the Truth of Poetry.  I mean, the parent doesn't know what that is, you know.
R:  No, but if they were given -- given like a heads up on it --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they might have the opportunity to actually --
L:  Right, to look into it and -- and -- and make sure that their kid isn't reading like sex, lies and videotape.
R:  Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, right.  Yeah, that's -- that's a good idea.  Like -- like a sort of a heads up but like wh- what you wanna be careful about though is -- is you don't wanna turn it into something where like the teacher has no choice in the matter.  Like -- and -- and -- and where like -- like you have to have like the state legislature approving the book lists, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because -- because then what happens is -- is it gets -- I mean, stuff -- it' -- it's very like bureaucratic and it's very -- I mean like -- like part of the nice thing about a -- a public school and about education in general in like -- in the United States, at least in my experience, is that like you have teachers who -- who -- who -- who pick different books and so, like, everyone gets a slightly different education, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and -- and everyone like, you know, has -- has different experiences and since the teachers are not completely but -- but somewhat free to -- to choose stuff, you know, then -- then there's like you -- you get to high school and -- and, you know, everyone knows different stuff and -- and everyone talk -- I -- I mean, I guess more like in the later years of high school and, you know, in college people -- people are sort of, you know, talking about different stuff and -- and discussing different books.
R:  True.
L:  So -- so you wanna be --
R:  That actually just reminded me about my high school [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  I remember that, like, in my -- I -- I loved my English classes --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I had found out about friends of mine that were in English classes that were reading books that I wanted to read.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, yeah, I -- I remember.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I had that experience.  I mean, I -- I took, uh -- I took, uh, AP English my -- my senior year and I was reading really dry stuff, you know [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I was like, you know, like Beowulf and like, you know, epics.  You know, the Iliad by Homer and it was really bor- boring and the professor, the -- the teacher rather, was like really good --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he was really good at it but -- and he was good at like, you know, bringing it alive and, you know, we acted some of it out and I mean it -- it was a good class but it was -- to be honest, it was boring shit, you know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It was like I mean -- and -- and my friends were in, like, you know, they -- they were in these lit classes, uh, that were, you know, much -- much more interesting.  They read -- you know, like -- like, uh, my girlfriend was like in a women's studies class and, you know, she was reading like The Handmaiden and you -- and I had friends who were like in -- like in moral -- you know, like moral literature classes where you read like, you know, re- really good stuff --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, that's, like, really compelling and yeah, -- and -- and now like -- like everyone has like a different -- a different take on it.
R:  Yeah, 'cause it's like now I wouldn't -- I -- I don't mind so much that I didn't get to read the stuff that I wanted to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because it gave me the opportunity to like kinda be forced to look into other stuff.
L:  Right.  Right, 'cause you're gonna read the stuff you wanna read anyway and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so like -- like if you -- if you have to read this other stuff that opens you up.  Yeah.  I know exactly what you mean.  Right, right 'cause like --
R:  'Cause like one of -- one of my English teachers made us read, um, the Red Badge of Courage.
L:  Oh.
