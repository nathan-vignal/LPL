L:  [NOISE] Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, uh, how's it going?
R:  Pretty good.  My name's --
L:  Uh, should we start?  I'm sorry what?
R:  Uh, My name's Gabriel.  What's your name?
L:  Quinn.
R:  Clint.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Nice to meet ya.  What -- did you get the topic?  It's about schools and censorship.
L:  [NOISE] It's censorship.  Um, I didn't quite get all of it, like is it appropriate to use -- to use censorship in some sort of scenario but I couldn't quite make it out.
R:  So, I got it.  It was about books, using books.  So, we think it's about, is it appropriate to censor certain books in school?
L:  Yeah, probably something like that [NOISE].
R:  Maybe that's it.
L:  You think there's ever a case where it's -- where it's, uh, appropriate?
R:  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  Um, oh you know it's, uh -- I guess -- I guess the case -- the cases where it's been, uh, an issue --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is, uh, is probably with literature that -- that, you know, maybe a little bit too, um, language of it, sexual content or something is too much --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and then I wouldn't -- and then I wouldn't think that censorship, um, -- you know, there should be some level unless your students can read it like I think high school students especially in this day and age are -- are able to, you know, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- deal with it at the time.
L:  But it seems -- it seems like -- it seems like the, uh, point at which we censor is always moving, always changing, you know.
R:  Uh-huh.  But, you -- but the -- but there is a point, you know, I guess is the --
L:  Well, I -- I guess there is.  Everybody has a point but I think that everybody's point is somewhere else.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I don't think -- I don't think there's one -- I don't -- I don't know if there's one point that people could -- could all agree on.
R:  Right, you couldn't all agree on it but -- but, um, there's -- there's gotta be, uh, some sort of compromise that people can accept because -- because, uh, you can't -- you know, in the end it's up to the parent to decide what they want their children reading and you can -- you know in schools, you can always get your parents to say I can't read this and they get a little note.
L:  Right.
R:  So, there should be some reasonable level of censorship that -- that isn't like too much for -- and that parent will be upset but isn't, you know, you know, too -- too little that every -- all the parents are going to be writing notes to -- you know, for their kids to not read, you know, whatever material it is, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, there's -- there's some -- there's probably some meaning -- some like compromise levels of censorship but what everyone not agree on but, you know, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with practice, you know, can -- can use.
L:  Right, right.  Um, so this is only about books.
R:  Yeah, I guess -- I guess it's only about books.  Um, I'm trying to think, uh, like if there are any books that I have read like when I -- when I -- when I was in school.  Um, like, uh, I remember I read a book in middle school that was about firefighters --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it had like a lot of -- it was about a New York firefighter and it had a lot of like, uh, kind of underground kind of like, uh, I suppose a lot of sexual content.  Like the -- the firefighter would, um, would like -- you know, it's kinda funny 'cause it sounds like a porn or something --
L:  Yeah, this is a school book?
R:  Yeah, well it wasn't a school book.  It was, like, in the library.  I found it and it was sort of, like, a biographical account.  I guess that's why it was in the library.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I was doing a report on, like, you know, firefighting or something and it was, like, a biography of some guy --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but it wasn't, like, him having sex or anything.  It was him like -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- he was like -- he would like, uh -- he would, like, bust some guys that were like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  He was like in the arseny[?] -- you know, the arseny division so he was like, um, like an investigator for --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like that sort of stuff and he would bust and find, like, you know, like, uh, like, portfolios or -- or whatever pictures of, like, some guy in like, you know, -- it'd be -- and his, like, girlfriend or some girl who worked for him.  It'd be stuff like that.  And I mean, pretty explicit and I was, like, reading this in like seventh grade and --
L:  And you were probably --
R:  -- I was pretty excited to, like, come across a book like that, you know but then probably --
L:  But did it warp you?  Do -- do you think --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you're a -- a worse person for it?
R:  No.
L:  I don't know.  Like in a -- in a way I think that, uh, I'd be happy if my kids were reading anything.  I think, like --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I think, like, what they can see from, uh, cable television is probably gonna be more -- I'd probably more want to censor that than everything they would see in a book.
R:  Oh, yeah.  And plus in a book you get like, sort of, like, a whole -- a whole, like, uh, kind of sophisticated, like, background and like you get the whole story, you know.  It's not just, like, the violence or, like, the sex but it's like --
L:  Yeah [NOISE]
R:  -- like people in a relationship and all that sort of thing.  It's like -- you feel like -- like -- like television is like it would just be -- more -- more -- more just like, uh, you know, images and -- and  action, just for the sake of entertainment and, you know, there are books that are like --
L:  With -- with a book you have -- you have to put some effort into it too --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to get anything out of it.
R:  Right.
L:  TV you can just sit there with your eyes open.
R:  Right, so I guess what we -- we agree on then is -- is it's not that big of a deal, censorship of books.  It's not like a huge issue.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And maybe -- maybe the more important issue would be, like, television or movies or I don't know, radio or something like that.
L:  I don't know.  I -- like I think the censorship is -- is more for the benefit of the parents than it is for the kids.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Like I remember as a kid -- as a kid, I would basically if -- if my parent told me that I shouldn't read something, that would just make me read it more and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I think -- I think that censoring just makes the parents feel better.  It makes them think that they're doing a good job raising their children. [NOISE].
R:  That's the benefit but if there's anything too you know, like the -- the -- like parents -- parenting and like that sort of guidanceship, if there's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if there's anything to that, then we have to admit that -- that some level of censorship would -- would -- would be good for the children too, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  Like why -- just to make the parents feel like they're being a good parent or is there -- like there's gotta be -- even if it's not as much as people think, but there's gotta be something.  I -- I never felt like I was -- like how much [inaudible] like being -- being, um, witnessing you know, whatever or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- reading whatever but there's gotta be -- you wouldn't -- I feel like you know, in [inaudible] I wouldn't like a three -- my -- my five year old kid or something getting like really explicit porn or something.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I feel like that wouldn't be good somehow, you know.
L:  Uh, yeah, I -- I agree there.  I mean, I think, uh, yeah, you don't wanna see -- you want -- you don't want the five year old watching porn.
R:  Right.
L:  That's obvious I think but [LAUGH] uh --
R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  Have you -- for -- for like high school kids --
R:  Uh-huh.  I think --
L:  -- I -- I think that --
R:  -- when you're at high school nowadays you can handle pretty much anything, right?
L:  I think so too.
R:  Just like at that point -- when you're fourteen, uh, we got the Internet and stuff and --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- and we -- we basically have been exposed to most -- most of what's out there.
L:  Yeah, because it's the --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  What?
R:  Uh, I was just gonna say in this day -- in this day and age, censorship for TV and books or whatever at the high school level would be kind of pointless, I would think.
L:  Right.
R:  That'd be my -- I guess, my --
L:  Uh --
R:  So, what -- what were you going to say?
L:  Um, let's see what I was going to say, well, yeah, I -- I basically -- I -- I would just be happy if my kid read [several inaudible words].  Uh, I'm -- I'm at -- I'm at a train station that's why it's so loud.
R:  Oh, okay.  Sorry.
L:  Um [LAUGH] I -- I -- yeah, I don't know.  I -- I think we should be happy that our kids are reading because if it's a censored thing and, like, if they wanna read something that has sex or violence in it, I think that -- I think that, like, reading just encourages more reading and even- and eventually they'll just move onto other things.
R:  Yeah, you get sick of it or whatever.  You -- you -- your curiosity --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is satisfied and you look -- and you go onto something else.
L:  Right.
R:  Right, I -- I agree with that too.
L:  Because I -- I know that [NOISE] I mean, at one point they wanted to censor -- oh, they did censor comic books and, you know, that's -- that's what got me started reading, you now.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I mean I appreciate it for that for being like sort of like the stepping stone into other things and, uh, hold on [NOISE].  Is that one to New York?  Okay.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, yeah, I wonder how much time we have left.
R:  Oh, let me check.  Hold on a sec.  Ten twenty two.  I guess I've been on for ten twenty two.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The cellphone thing so they should cut us off in a second, I think.
L:  Mhm.  Well, is there anything more to add to this --
R:  Discussion.
L:  -- issue? [LAUGH]
R:  Well, [MN] yeah, I guess but what -- what conclusion did we come to, if any?  Let's recap.
L:  All right.  Well, as a recap I think my basic opinion is that, uh, censoring books is probably not a good idea in almost --
R:  Agreed.
L:  -- in almost all cases except for the most --
R:  The five year olds.
L:  -- obviously extreme stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, because I think that just reading anything should be encouraged.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But -- but TV is anoth- another matter because it's -- it's passive entertainment --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and you don't -- you don't need to use your mind to, uh, to do it but --
R:  Yeah, and you probably should have some -- some basic guidelines in school just to ...
