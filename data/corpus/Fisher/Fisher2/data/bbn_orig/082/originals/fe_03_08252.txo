R:  Hello.
L:  Hello, my name's Phillip.  I live in New York.
R:  Hi, my name is Pamela.  I live in DC.
L:  Oh, hello.
R:  Hi.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh, yeah.  So, how do you feel about censorship?  Like --
R:  Um, did you catch the question?  It -- it was asking about how they felt about --
L:  Yeah.  Like, the books, like, should schools, like, make people read certain books, or --
R:  Ah, so it was should they make them read it?  Not should they censor certain books?
L:  Yeah.  Tha- -- it mentioned, like, a complete different question when I first picked up.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.  Um --
L:  Um, I think it's -- I th- -- I mean, I think it's definitely good for -- for certain books, like, I don't know.  I mean, like, when -- when I -- when I went to school couple of years, you know, a few years ago, had to read certain books and I, you know, I liked it.  It was, I mean, there are some things that I didn't want to really -- I didn't really think about.
R:  Right.
L:  Like, 'specially learning about other cultures and being forced to read those books while probably not the best way to do it, did expose me to different beliefs that I didn't experience from living in the US.  And in the end I -- I did appreciate it.  Ah, how do you feel?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh, yeah.  No.  Absolutely.  Um, you know, during school there was set reading lists, uh, 'specially during the summers and, um, I, [MN] you know, even though I didn't enjoy reading them, um, the fact that they made me read them, um, I think it did open my eyes to different cultures and different styles of writing.  But today I probably didn't -- actu- -- I -- I wouldn't choose for myself but at least you get the exposure to those books.  Uh --
L:  Right.  Yea- yeah.  I mean, I think it's great for, like, um, interacting with other people.  Um, 'cause it gives you an idea of where they may be coming from.  
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  Um, 'cause, I mean, mostly people largely interact with, uh, like, [LIPSMACK] um, [LIPSMACK] I guess like up tight [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and c- -- there's so much like shallow talk about things that I'm not really into.  But then there are t- -- occasions where I do meet other people from other states or other country.  And when they talk about something, like, I have an idea what they're talking about.  I just l- -- I love that.
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  So, it's a -- it's exotic.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  No.  No.  Absolutely.  I mean, do you still read things that, I mean, like, there are published book lists like New York Times book list or recommended list.  Like, will you ever take a book and just, um --
L:  Um --
R:  -- read it?
L:  -- right now, right now I haven't -- I haven't really taken any looks at, like, any of those published book lists at all.   I mean, right now I'm reading, um, like, right now I'm reading The Three Kingdoms.
R:  What is that?  No, I don't know --
L:   Uh, The Three Kingdoms.  It's a book that was written in China and covered, um, this war between, like, these three families for a couple of hundred years.  And it's definitely interesting, [MN] I mean, it's -- it's translated so I'm, um, [LIPSMACK] it has a lot of symbolism in it.  So, it's -- it's a lot different from what I would normally read.
R:  Okay.
L:  You know.
R:  Oh, that's interesting.  
L:  Like, from, like, s- -- you know, Stephen King, all that stuff, like, that's very simply laid out. 
R:  Right.
L:  You know, it's very straight forward. 
R:  Right.
L:  Here I have to actually sit down sometimes and just, like, wait, what the hell -- what the heck is he trying to say?  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] And why di- 
L:  So --
R:  -- why did you pick the book? 
L:  Um, I had -- I've had it in my library for a long time.  I just never really looked at it --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so I'm trying to force myself just to read it because it's something that I'm not normally used to reading.  
R:  Right.  Right.  Yeah, even though, like, you're not being forced by school or something, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- maybe it is a good thing after all.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Did you know -- they said the topic was censorship, um, like, have you ever had an experience where, like, a book was censored in the school you went to?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Oh, you have?  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  When -- when, um, when I used to go to elementary school, um, I -- I believe it's like a third grade, um, this -- I -- I was going to school out in Missouri --
R:  Oh, right.
L:  -- St Louis, Missouri.  And they had a -- actually a lot of problems with Mark Twain.
R:  Right.  Yeah, I have heard --
L:  They wouldn't let -- let you read that.  Uh, there was, like, so many other books on there, I can't even remember now.  I think Tom Saw- -- like, basically, you know, anything from -- from, uh, Mark Twain was, like, pretty much gone.  Like, you couldn't read 'em.  But --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- it's, like, I mean, it's part of, you know, I'm living in a -- in a state that's along the Mississippi, you'd expect that, you know, to be at least, like, I don't know, [LIPSMACK] preferred reading list --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- or something.
R:  Not a censored reading list, yeah.
L:  You know.  I mean, it's the Mississippi River, you know, it's covering -- it's covering a location that's, like, right -- right in the back door.
R:  Right.  Yeah, that is weird.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Um --
L:  What about you?
R:  Well, I grew up in New York.  So, I think, I can't remember any books that were censored.  Like, I think most books were fair game and -- and they were fairly liberal about censorship -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- uh, growing up.  So, uh, you know, I -- I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- don't think--
L:  W- wh- when I was in New York, I didn't have any problems with books either.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It was mainly when I was out in the mid west or when I saw some -- I used to also live in Utah.  And in Utah it was -- where I lived, Jeeba[?] City, it was really religious.  So, if it wasn't abou- -- if it -- basically wasn't, like, Christianity or anything like that, you would not even find it in the boo- -- in the books --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- in the libraries.
R:  See I completely --
L:  I mean, I had a hard enough time trying to find books on Greek mythology.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Anything I guess pag- -- I mean, people are having problems with Harry Potter now.  I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I've heard, um --
L:  I mean, it's ridiculous.
R:  Yeah.  No, it is completely --
L:  I mean, it's, you know  it's like -- [MN] like most of these kids today, they're smart enough to realize it's, you know, it's fiction.
R:  right.
L:  But then when adults treat it as if it's fact, it kind of blurs the reality for the te- -- for kids --
R:  Right.
L:  -- wh- what's reality and what's fiction.
R:  When they start censoring it, it becomes something kids start wondering why they're doing it.
L:  Exactly.  It's like, I thought this was fiction --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- why is it being censored?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's not fact.  But then they treat it as fact then [LIPSMACK] forget about it.  [NOISE] All the kids get too confused. 
R:  Yeah.  Sounds very strange.
L:  Yeah.  So, are you reading anything right now; that you probably wouldn't read in school?
R:  Um, no.  actually, most of the [LAUGH] time I read, I probably, um, you know, read the back and see if it interests me and, like, so, yeah, I mean, most of the time -- that's why it was good to be exposed to, like, a lot of the stuff in school 'cause, like, now I probably would never -- and, you know, don't have the time to pick up a really long book or really involved; that doesn't interest me at all.  So, um, no, not really. 
L:  Did you, like, when you -- when you went to school, did you read any, um, books from, like, other culture, like specific cultures?
R:  Um, yeah.  I mean, I -- I think I remember reading books from India, um, [LIPSMACK] [several inaudible words] I mean, most of them were American or -- or British.  [MN] 
L:  Right.
R:  Um --
L:  Like the western European?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not even, you know, that many French, I mean, I think we had, like, um, Camoo[?] and, like, um, yeah, like, Ameshi[?] for things like that.  But most of it was based in the, you know, written in English.
L:  Right.
R:  They weren't really translations.
L:  Yeah.  I -- now that I think about it, like, I -- I didn't really read that much, like, from other cultures.  I -- like, I read a few books from African writers.
R:  right.
L:  Uh, like, one or two from Chinese writers, but pretty much everything was either gr- -- either translated from Greek or Latin.
R:  Oh, right, right.
L:  As well as, like, the western, European stuff --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and American books.
R:  I forgot about those.  Like [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- [several inaudible words] odyssey and -- 
L:  Yeah.  Th- those philosophy books and what not.
R:  Yeah.  That's true.  I forgot that those are translated.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it's still kind of a s- -- I don't know, it's still western culture, as opposed to, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think that sort of stuff I learned about, like, uh, foreign countries is, like, social studies readings.  Not necessarily fiction, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  But, um, [inaudible] --
L:  It still counts.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- yeah.  Yeah, I guess.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I mean, I definitely think, like, you know, being more open about the different types of books out there is more helpful for today since, you know, as the world's becoming more united into, like, this global village. .
R:  Right.
L:  You know, it's like everyone interacts now so [LAUGH] ...
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.  I mean, yeah, exactly.  If kids can, like, get online and talk to kids from other countries, which I couldn't do when I was at school, I mean --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- um, you know, you could -- telephone calls cost, uh, so much --
L:  Oh, [inaudible] --
R:  -- that you couldn't even think of others.
L:  -- but now the Internet's just like --
R:  Free, yeah.
L:  -- forget -- forget the long distance phone calls.
R:  Yeah, I mean, you could just talk to anybody and ten you can play chess, you know, like, checkers with them online and  --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, so it's good, like, kids know or be exposed to any, you know, all these types of cultures through their classroom reading, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  So, they understand the --
L:  D- do you have any children right now?  Or ...
R:  No.  No.  I don't.
L:  No.  Yeah.  Neither do I.  I d- definitely, like, when I do I'm -- I think one -- that's one of the things I'll really pay attention to, it's just I -- I'd really want them to have a good e- -- good reading experience so I -- I want to try and, like, have them at least read, like, one book from every possible culture if anything.
R:  Right.  That's a good idea.  Yeah.
L:  And expose them to different ideas, different ways of thinking, cultural values.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Like, not limit -- not limit them to one -- I mean, I've seen., like, some parents, like, on the street they, you know, from what I can tell they seem to raise their parent -- their children are, like, one specific type of, like, culture I guess.  
R:  Right.
L:  Or like -- or I guess the way they were raised.  And, like, a lot of times I've seen the kids, like, act really ignorant towards other people of, like, other cultures.
R:  Right.
L:  Like, you know, they'll [inaudible] I mean, it gets in to the point where -- where in the -- in the -- in the future it could probably turn into racism.  Just not -- not like racism based -- based on hate, but more, like, racism based on ignorance.
R:  Right.
L:  And --
R:  It's probably, I mean --
L:  -- that's definitely something I don't think --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they really need in the future.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  And you think by censoring books, it could, like, definitely increase?
L:  Yeah.  I mean it, you know, it's -- censorship is just -- it's like a forbidden fruit, you know.   You tell the kid -- you tell someone not to eat something but it's just sitting there --
R:  Right.
L:  -- no one's around, eventually they're going to get really curious and they're going to just probably try and take a bite.
R:  Actually, it's -- that's really true, I mean, 'cause they prob- --
