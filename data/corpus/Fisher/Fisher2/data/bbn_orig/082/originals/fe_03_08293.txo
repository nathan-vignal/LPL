R:  Mystique.
L:  Hi, I'm Eunice
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] I'm fine, and you? [NOISE]  
R:  I'm good. [SIGH] 
L:  Well, good.  I didn't catch your name.
R:  Um, it's Mystique.
L:  Mystique?
R:  Yes.
L:  Very good. [SIGH] 
R:  Um, what was the question again?
L:  The question is do we believe [SIGH] that private or public schools have the rights to censorship certain books. [SIGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] And what do they mean by censorship? [inaudible] 
L:  Censorship means to me [SIGH] whether or not that -- that they can forbid [SIGH] --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- a child from [MN] selecting -- a student --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- from selecting a particular book. [SIGH]  [NOISE] 
R:  Well, um, to me --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I mean, that all depends on the book it is --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- because [LIPSMACK] I definitely [LIPSMACK] wouldn't want my child, I mean, reading a certain book, +especially, I mean, if it's in school, you know. [SIGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Well, that's what --
R:  So --
L:  -- I feel.  If [SIGH] -- I think that public schools can take it to court more than what the private -- but absolutely in a private school --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] they should have all the rights to -- to say what can be read and what they cannot, because that's the idea of being in a private school.
R:  Basically.
L:  [SIGH] I was thinking in the terms of, um, [SIGH] -- [NOISE] just hear recently on the news about the young man that [SIGH] -- that had planned on [MN] doing another Columbine shooting and [SIGH] -- and --
R:  [LIPSMACK] I thought it was three, um, young men.
L:  Yes, it was -- well, it was more than one. [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah, uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE] And I do believe that it was, like, three --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, uh, [SIGH] at that rate, you know, they can go in and -- and [NOISE] -- [SIGH] and find all kinds of books that -- of --
R:  Basically.
L:  -- bombings and [SIGH] -- and all kinds of --
R:  Basically, because I find --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that -- I mean --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um, [LIPSMACK] how --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- do they know, [LIPSMACK] um, how to make --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- a bomb?
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  It's just crazy.  It's the things they read, basically.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  And I mean --
L:  [SIGH] It's not a -- it's not a -- just a knowledge --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- there's books out there and -- [SIGH] and I -- I'm in favor of c-
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- censorship, I really am.
R:  I know, [SIGH] and, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't think that it's only the schools --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- like, [NOISE] [SIGH] --um, like -- like, who should ban the certain books.  As a parent, I mean, you should, I mean, know what your kids are reading, um, [LIPSMACK] also, you know.
L:  Right, right.
R:  So that's a big thing anyway.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] It's both ways, you know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- know what your kids are doing and --
L:  [SIGH] Mhm.
R:  -- know what they're reading basically --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and, I mean, you should be fine.
L:  Exactly, [SIGH] and -- and -- the -- some of the books -- I'm -- I'm almost sixty years old and --
R:  Mm. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- some [LAUGH] of the books that are available now --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [SIGH] just -- they still shock me. [SIGH] 
R:  Well, okay.
L: [SIGH] So, I [LAUGH] -- I b- really would not want my grandchildren picking 'em up. [LAUGH]  
R:  Yeah, um --
L:  Um --
R:  -- well, I read a lot, but I mean, my books are --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- are --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um, basically mystery romance, I mean --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like -- like -- I mean, none of that, um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um, [LIPSMACK] you know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] bogus books.
L:  Right. [SIGH] I, um -- I just read mostly Christian books myself --
R:  [NOISE] Okay. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and, um, [NOISE] like I say, I know what's in [LAUGH] some of the books that are out there 'cause I hear 'em talk about 'em [NOISE] on --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- different radio programs --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] and I'd be [NOISE] petrified to have my [NOISE] grandchildren [NOISE] [SIGH] have to read those --
R:  And I also --
L:  -- you know.
R:  -- think that certain stories need --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- to be banned from [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- some of those kind of books.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I mean, come on.
L:  [NOISE] [MN] 
R:  That's --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- just crazy.
L:  And -- and it's going to be the children that would want to get a hold of 'em more --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] you take one child, you know, and if one child's -- his parents say he can read this book --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and he -- [SIGH] he brings it to school --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- regardless of the age --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] and starts showing it around, [MN] all the kids are going to want to see it. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  Basically.  I get that.
L:  And if -- if they didn't then they'll -- they'll be making fun of 'em and it's just easier to stop it before it gets started. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] 
R:  [SIGH] I'd say --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- but, [SIGH] um, now that --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [LAUGH] now that guy's father --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- is defending him --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- saying he don't think his son planned to do, um, [LIPSMACK] anything.
L:  [SIGH] [MN] 
R:  Did you see the amount of weapons they found him with?
L:  [SIGH] Yes, the very first time when -- when they -- they showed -- when they just had arrested him, and I haven't [SIGH] been home the last two days to catch the news much. [SIGH] But I -- like, yeah, [LAUGH] and I -- [SIGH] and you know they had to get books [NOISE] or they --
R:  So --
L:  -- were on the internet. [NOISE] 
R:  He's s- okay --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- he's saying --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- he's, um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- he's innocent --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- but what --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- would an innocent kid --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- be doing [LAUGH] with all that weapon.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm just curious.
L:  [LAUGH] Exactly.
R:  I'm just so curious, but --
L:  They were not hunting rifles by any means. [SIGH] 
R:  I do think that certain books should be banned from public and private school --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and they should both --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- equally have a fair say --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- which book kids should read, and which --
L:  Since we are --
R:  -- books they shouldn't.
L:  -- talking on this subject, it'd be interesting to see on the news [SIGH] if -- what they come up with as far as books if --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- whether or the [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- children -- I call 'em children because --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they're going to be tried as children, [SIGH] what kind of books they had in their possession.
R:  Mhm. [SIGH] Well, um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- bad enough, I mean, certain --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- school --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- +especially, [SIGH] um, the public school, hardly have any books anyway, so --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I mean, we're -- kinda --
L:  They're getting kinda harder, yeah, [SIGH] to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to [NOISE] -- [SIGH] and -- but the American Library Association does not believe in any kind of censorship. [SIGH] They believe that students should be able to come in and [SIGH] -- and check out what books they want --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] without parents' [NOISE] knowledge --
R:  You know what?
L:  -- and I don't approve of that either. [SIGH] 
R:  A book, um, should be like a movie.  If you're --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- under a certain age, you can't see it without a parent --
L:  Right.
R:  -- basically.
L:  Because there's so many sexually [NOISE] --
R:  Bas- yeah.
L:  -- [NOISE] specific books. [SIGH] 
R:  And, I mean, um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- those books are actually in the library.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm. [SIGH] So I hear.
R:  I mean, that's crazy.
L:  I've never [LAUGH] seen 'em and I don't want to see 'em. [LAUGH] 
R:  I n- I have seen --
L:  [SIGH]  
R:  -- those books in the library.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  It's just crazy, you know?
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] 
R:  I don't know, uh, I don't have any kids and [LAUGH] I don't --
L:  Oh, you don't? [SIGH] 
R:  No.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, [SIGH] 
R:  So, and when I get kids --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] I'll have something to worry about 'em --
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  -- but until then --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I don't have any --
L:  [SIGH] [NOISE] 
R:  -- so 
L:  I -- then there's nothing like it, there --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- is nothing like it and my -- [SIGH] my grandkids [NOISE] even make me happier than my children --
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- did, which I didn't think was possible. [NOISE] 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH] But it's a tough row out there when [SIGH] so many people think that whatever [NOISE] they want to do --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] they should be able to do it without any effect on the kids.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] And that includes the books, and that's not true. [SIGH] Um --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- [NOISE] it's just too sad. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, it's very sad.
L:  [SIGH] [NOISE] I expect that with the homosexuality part, as far as [NOISE] [SIGH] even the books that -- that's on that, and that's not our subject [NOISE] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I won't go there, it's the fact that [NOISE] I [LAUGH] hear there's [LAUGH] books showing, [SIGH] and I [LAUGH] certainly wouldn't want my grandkids getting hold of that book.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] Whether a child [NOISE] [LAUGH] brings it to school or not, [NOISE] [SIGH] and I refer as children 'cause [SIGH] even seventeen year old are children. [LAUGH] 
R:  Basically, you're right.
L:  So [NOISE] --
R:  You're absolutely right.
L:  But we are in accordance with the -- the censorship, I [SIGH] I'm --
R:  I hope so.
L:  -- in full favor of it, I really am. [SIGH] [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, I really hope so.  Um --
L:  It's still amazing that they can [NOISE] take the [NOISE] Bible out of public schools. [SIGH] They can censor the Bible [SIGH] --
R:  Oh really?  I mean --
L:  -- but that then they say they have free --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- rights to take all take all the other stuff still.
R:  I -- um, yeah --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- that's kind of true, mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] It's just --
R:  But, um [LAUGH] s--
L:  [SIGH] It just amazes me.
R:  I w- [SIGH] no, go ahead.
L:  That's fine, I was just saying it just amazes me that [SIGH] they can censorship the Bible but [NOISE] [SIGH] they --
R:  But --
L:  -- can bring in all these things [NOISE] it's just [NOISE] --
R:  But, um --
L:  -- to me it's pornographic. [LAUGH] 
R:  I would, like, um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- agree with the Bible not being --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- in schools, because, I mean, not the whole school is Christian.
L:  Mhm. [SIGH] 
R:  So, I mean --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that's just like bringing, um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [NOISE] like --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- let's see --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I mean, whatever the Muslims study, I mean, that's just like br-
L:  Well, they -- they do.  In some of the public schools around here where we live --
R:  No way.
L:  -- [SIGH] th- they have been showing 'em what the +Koran is [SIGH] because of the fact that -- [SIGH] of what took place on nine eleven.
R:  I don't think -- no way.  No, that's --
L:  They have, absolutely. [SIGH] 
R:  -- that's unethical, I mean --
L:  So, if they can have one --
R:  -- religion should not --
L:  -- they should have all. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- religion should [LAUGH] not be --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- taught in school.  I do not believe that.  No way --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  I don't believe it.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  I don't think so anyway.
L:  [MN] Well, that's different, between teaching it and making it available.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] It's -- so, if they -- you know, if they have one available, then the other has to be available.  They can't censorship --
R:  But if they have --
L:  -- in that respect. [NOISE] [SIGH] 
R:  -- but if they have, like, one --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I mean, they're going to have to have all of them.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  I mean, every single one of them --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  --you know. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  I agree. [NOISE] [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Mm, mm, mm.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [LIPSMACK] Is this your first call?
L:  Yes, it is. [MN] [SIGH] 
R:  Really?  It's my first too. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] My daughter told me about it and I just signed up yesterday and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- [SIGH] and [LAUGH] -- [MN] it's kind of hard to continue when you're in agreement. [LAUGH] 
R:  Huh?
L:  [SIGH] Uh --
R:  Okay, that's it.
L:  -- what else to talk about, [NOISE] but --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- uh  [NOISE] 
R:  And what are you supposed to do --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- though, basically?
L:  [NOISE] As far as these calls?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] It's just a conversation on how we feel about whatever subject and -- [SIGH] and they're trying to test the -- the phone lines to see how well [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the call comes through is the way I gather. [NOISE] Um --
R:  Um, is the hospital or a school?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Pardon?
R:  [LIPSMACK] The University of Penn?
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, it's a school.
R:  Okay, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- University of Penn. [SIGH] 
L:  Pennsylvania --
R:  I though it was a --
L:  -- I presume. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- hospital.  Huh?
L:  [SIGH] I bere- I believe --
R:  Yeah, yeah, it's Pennsylvania.
L:  -- it's Pennsylvania.
R:  [LIPSMACK] I live in Pennsylvania, but I mean --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] they, um -- [LIPSMACK] they also have [SIGH] [NOISE] -- [SIGH] um, they also have, like, [LIPSMACK] the hospital here [SIGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, [SIGH] I was not sure it was a school or a hospital, so 
L:  I -- I thought it was the -- the school.  I'm not really sure myself. [SIGH] Um, I'm here in Kansas City. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So 
R:  Okay.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Now, um, I'm trying to get people to sign up, because they say you get people to sign --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- up they give you extra money so --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I don't know.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  [MN] 
L:  I don't know about that either. [NOISE] 
R:  [LIPSMACK] Are you doing this just --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- uh, uh, uh, um, for the money --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- or just to doing it?
L:  Just to be doing it basically.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, they said that you could [SIGH] cancel out [LAUGH] if you want to, as far as -- [SIGH] you don't have to take the money.  Well, [SIGH] get out of town, you know. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Why not, [LAUGH] you know? [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] But it -- uh, yeah, it's kind of fun. [LAUGH] It [MN] -- um, kinda like in days past of having a pen pal, except [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's just a one time thing. [SIGH] My husband -- my s- daughter asked [NOISE] him if he would like to do it, and he looked at her so strangely, like --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [LAUGH] "Talk to somebody I don't know?" [NOISE] So --
R:  It's not that bad.
L:  No. [SIGH] [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  But I don't know how to continue on the subject of censorship, I'm just in -- [SIGH] I -- especially in the private schools, there's no -- there's not anything to say about that. [NOISE] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] That's what makes [NOISE] them private [MN] [NOISE] 'cause they can set up their own rules. [SIGH] 
R:  Well, they said that --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] that you only have to, um, --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- continue on the subject for, um, ten minutes, so --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- and we've been talking about it for more than ten minutes.
L:  [SIGH] I have no idea, [SIGH] but they're suppose to call -- they're supposed to beep --
