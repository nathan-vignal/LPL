L:  Hi.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  [LAUGH] I'm Gloria Lane.  I live in Georgia. [NOISE] 
R:  Hello, Gloria Lane.  My name is June McKenzie and I live in Pennsylvania, [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- so we're having pretty much the same kind of weather at this time.
L:  Are you?  Yes.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, I've been in Pennsylvania.  I -- I really like it there. [LIPSMACK] Um, how do you like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- our topic today? [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] Well, uh it certainly is an interesting one and I've had some personal experience with that, Gloria.  [NOISE] Uh, my oldest daughter was an avid reader from the time she was two years old and uh [LIPSMACK] the schools -- I had a lot of trouble with uh the schools in -- [NOISE] in that --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they would not allow her to read --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- uh ahead of her -- her -- her grade level you know.  [NOISE] [SIGH] So I'm very much against [NOISE] a -- a school telling a child that they can't read this or that or the other thing.  Even -- even if it is ah, questionable material.  [NOISE] I think a child [NOISE] who uh, is -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- intelligent enough to look subjects and [NOISE] uh, research different --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- subjects is intelligent enough [NOISE] to know when [NOISE] -- when --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- trash is trash you know.
L:  With my daughter in [COUGH] school something similar happened.  Um [SIGH] I have always told her --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that to -- with any subjects there is always pros and cons.
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  Well, they had asked them to write about uh cocaine [LAUGH] in school.  So I told her --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- I said, "There's pros and cons" so she did research and uh she --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- came up with uh [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- her essay and--
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- read it in the class and even though she got A plus from the school there were a lot of the parents that were unhappy with it.  And --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- she was talking about --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- from the stand point of it being used as an anesthetic and it, at times, you know, had been used in operations --
R:  [NOISE] Right -- right.
L:  -- but uh [MN] I was really surprised.  There's a lot of censorship --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- in this area.
R:  [NOISE] Yes.  Ah --
L:  Is -- is there in yours?
R:  [NOISE] Well, my kids are out of school now --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- so of course I don't ha- --
L:  So are mine.
R:  -- yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't have too much [NOISE] ah, to do with  but [MN] we are censored every day [NOISE] as to how much we can hear about what's going on in our --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- government.  I mean, every --
L:  Do you think that's a good thing?
R:  No, I think it's terrible.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I think it's terrible.  I hate censorship in any form.
L:  [NOISE] Well, I had wondered.  You know, when Geraldo um made that boo boo during the war and actually drew a map in the sand?
R:  Yes.
L:  Uh [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that could have uh given the enemy a lot of the information --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and I -- and I agreed with the censorship on that.  I agreed that it was in uh [MN] -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it wasn't in good taste for him to even do that.  Um, what do you think about that?
R:  Well, I -- I think in that --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- particular instance that -- that the censorship was [SIGH] -- 
L:  [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] 
R:  -- was ah, certainly ah [MN] you know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- called for.  However --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- in -- you know [MN] in most cases, Gloria, it's not called for.  I mean [MN] we're not stupid.  We --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- we know that people make mistakes and okay, so if they make --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- a mistake I want to know about it --
L:  Right.  Mhm.
R:  -- because I want to be able to weigh --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- their mistakes --
L:  Weigh the information yourself.
R:  -- against -- against their --
L:  That's what I like about --
R:  -- accomplishments.  Right.
L:  -- the internet.  A lot of times I go to opposing sides --
R:  Oh yes. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- uh, just to be able to get the information.
R:  Right -- right.  I go to ah, the ah, English and German newspapers a lot [SIGH]--
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and also a couple in um [LIPSMACK] Djakarta uh --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- over in Indonesia.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [MN] Because they tell what's going on in our -- in our politics --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- with ah no bias and -- and no ah --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- frosting on -- on the cakes.  You know?  And [MN] as I said [SIGH] I -- I hardly even listen to the [MN] news on -- in -- on our channels here because you can't believe what they're saying.  They either twist the truth or eliminate it or censor it and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and I am so --
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  -- totally against that.
L:  And I notice that the spin on politics [LAUGH] --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- is absolutely amazing.  [LAUGH]
R:  It certainly is.
L:  I can tell [LAUGH] which side it's coming from just by the content. [LAUGH] Can you?
R:  [MN] Absolutely -- absolutely.  And uh --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- so you know it's just a -- a darn shame that [SIGH] -- that they feel that ah we're so stupid that we don't know this, you know, ah 
L:  [MN] Mhm.  What was your first name again?
R:  June.
L:  June.
R:  Right.
L:  And my middle name is June. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, is it really?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, isn't that something, Gloria June?
L:  Ah huh. [inaudible] --
R:  Oh, how nice.  Ah that's -- 
L:  And I --
R:  Go ahead.
L:  And I got the name June because that's when uh mother and father found out they were expecting so  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] So you were born in June too?
L:  Y- -- no, I was born in March but they found out in June they were going to be parents.
R:  Oh, I see --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I see.  Okay, I've got it straightened around now.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  No censorship there.  At least it wouldn't last very long, would it?
L:  [LAUGH] Wouldn't at all.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Not at all.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But the uh, you know, our First Amendment gives us the right --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- of uh free speech and -- and uh [SIGH] I don't see how schools feel as if they can [SIGH] really determine what books -- especially -- shouldn't that be the parents um --
R:  It certainly should be --
L:  -- right to --?
R:  -- the parents' decision.  Yes.  Right.  And -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and ah, they've taken uh --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- a lot of our ah -- our rights away from us uh in determining uh -- I'd like to see them um bring the paddles back out.  I think some of these smart mouthed little kids might get some respect --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- back in them again but it [MN] --
L:  I've noticed that the Harry Potter books -- there's a lot of controversy being connected with that in this area. 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  There's some of the religious [SIGH] uh --
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  -- churches are saying that -- that it's wrong.  Well, I rented a Harry Potter movie at sixty five to [LAUGH] see --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- what it was about and -- and I just thought it was you know, a little fantastic thing with the [SIGH] -- the magic and everything, but I didn't see where it would give any information to a child that would be uh controversial to them.
R:  Well, you know, how much different -- I haven't read any of them --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- although my grandchildren uh read them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, they -- they're in line at midnight when the stores start selling them, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They can't wait for them to come out [SIGH] and uh they certainly haven't uh grown horns or anything.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm glad they're just reading.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Most any day. [SIGH]
R:  But you know, how different can they be from like uh, the Wizard of Oz or ah --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  -- Alice in the Looking Glass, and you know those --
L:  And -- and I have noticed that in the children's stories there's a great deal of uh -- of higher consciousness actually being um given in a fantasy type ah book.
R:  Oh, is that right?
L:  Mhm.
R:  See, I haven't read any of them so --
L:  Well, you know like Cinderella. 
R:  Oh -- oh yes.
L:  Yeah, even --
R:  Oh I -- I see what you're saying now.
L:  Yes.
R:  Yes.
L:  You know th- -- other was -- that's married to the prince and you know, the prince could be the uh inner consciousness, uh --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And in -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in that way.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So uh I see --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- a lot of beauty --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- in those and um --
R:  I -- oh well, I -- I loved fairy tales myself.  I just loved them.
L:  How old are you, June?
R:  I'm seventy three.
L:  Are you?
R:  Yuh huh.
L:  Well good.  We're -- we're -- we're at the age we now know a little something [LAUGH] don't we?
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I was wondering, Gloria, have any of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the schools censored th- ah the Harry Potter -- Potter books in your area?
L:  [SIGH] No.  From what I gather the schools in this area -- there's little kids live next door to me and they think I'm their grandmother [LAUGH] I do believe --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and they like the Harry Potter things.  It's mostly the churches and [LAUGH] some of the older people that -- that are so against it and so [SIGH] willing to speak out about it.  [SIGH] Um --
R:  Isn't that amazing?
L:  -- but I don't think the schools have done anything along that line.
R:  I wonder how many of those people have actually read --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Mm.
R:  -- the books.
L:  Probably none. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And h- --
R:  Yes.  Someone mentioned witchcraft and -- and they --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- take off with it you know.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's -- it's uh [LIPSMACK] pretty sad how some people will speak out like [SIGH] in a case like that --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- when -- when they really don't know what they're talking about.
L:  Have you noticed that a  [PAUSE] [LAUGH] Are we through? [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't know.  Someone --
L:  [MN] I heard a -- I heard a beep [LAUGH] anyway.
R:  I heard something. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well I -- I heard you get cut off is what I heard.
L:  Oh, that's what I -- you too, so I imagine that -- they're expecting us to say, "Goodbye" huh?  I've enjoyed it.  I could go on talking to you for a long time, June.
R:  Well, I could too, Gloria.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  No [LAUGH] and that wouldn't bother me.  It's hard -- 
L:  We -- we could -- we can solve the world's ills can't we? [LAUGH] 
R:  A- absolutely.  Maybe we'll get elected, you know? [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] We'll --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- run for something, won't we? [MN] 
R:  Well, it's been a delight, Gloria.
L:  It's been a del- --
R:  I'm very glad I got to talk with you.
L:  Thank you.  And it has been the same with me.  Bye, June.
R:  Bye, Gloria.
L:  [NOISE]
