R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  My name's Sherry.
R:  Oh, my name is Ann.
L:  Hi.
R:  Ah, I guess our topic of the day is ah whether or not private schools have the right to forbid certain books.  Is that what you understood?
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.  Ah, well, I guess I -- I've been ah um, inv- very involved with my kids' education for a long time and -- and um I think with our permissive society I -- I think it is a good idea that certain books should be banned, um, um, I -- I guess um freedom of speech is important, but ah ah there's certain topics I don't think um certain kids are -- are mature enough to handle and -- and um that -- that's more or less what I think.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I would agree with that, I think um there's a lot of books that contain material that's really not appropriate for school --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um study and although I think it's kind of important that they would have some parent in- parental input on that too, I don't know, I've been involved with --
R:  Yeah.  I -- I think that's the key, um, parental input is very important and and ah with people leading such busy lives, it leaves little room ah for parents to become actively involved in their children's education and um a lot of the people who are involved in -- in um um developing curriculum and -- and setting a lot of the standards um have such um far flung ideas that ah [LAUGH] you know --
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  -- it's not always in keeping with um what -- what the parents um want and um, yeah, it -- it's, you know, I -- I don't believe, you know, complete censorship is -- is ah the rule, but um -- um, a lot of um material is offensive to people, I -- I guess I don't like um swearing and -- and ah I don't like a lot of violent literature and -- and ah --
L:  I know.  And I --
R:  -- I don't think that is --
L:  -- I don't like immoral type behavior in books --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I -- I know that there's been a lot of controversy with the Harry Potter books --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in the school systems and, you know, that -- I don't know, are you familiar with those at all?
R:  [LIPSMACK] I sort of have a gist of it and um I work in a school myself and um the teachers ah tell me that the kids are trying to read all these books and ah they're really much more adult books than they are kids book at this point.  I think the first one was um, um not so bad, but ah all the subsequent ones are -- are um, usually too high --
L:  Geared more --
R:  -- a level for -- for the kids--
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- who want to read them.  But the -- it's such media hype that the kids are just ah sucked in by --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- by it, you know, and yeah, so it's ah [SIGH] ah and I -- I guess the ah -- another thing is, I -- I studied um some psychology and the effect of media and ah how it can be very um -- how is it -- well, not hazardous, but ah very detrimental to children's um development and ah reading um violent um things ah too early in age, um, it's very damaging to them, I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I think it's reflected in our society with all the violence because of all, you know, all that they experience all around them in the media, the books, the, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the movies, you know, ah -- e- the -- the um curtain just keeps being pushed further and further on -- on -- in all avenues, um and um I -- I think people are just so busy that they -- they have lost the other sense of or -- or [MN] lost these sense of ah control in that they don't have time [LAUGH] because they're so busy --
L:  You know, and -- and I'm trying to think back when I was a child in school -- I don't really think necessarily my parents read all the books that, you know, I was required to read --
R:  No.
L:  -- a- so, I don't know if it's necessarily parents don't have more time, maybe it's just the -- the books are not as good now, or a lot of them aren't as good as what used to be available --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but um, I don't know, I -- with the Harry Potter ones, I have read them, my kids have read them, of course my kids are most of them older not in elementary school anymore but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, I -- I -- from what I have heard on that particular book when it was censored, most of it wasn't doing with violence or those kinds of issues, it was because it had magic --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and witchcraft type things in it and, you know, and, I don't know, I had kind of a hard time understanding why they would make an issue of that and then, you know, Cinderella -- well, not Cinderella, but Snow White and some of the others that have wicked witches, those type --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- stories are okay [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.  I -- I don't believe in witches or anything like that but I'm just [MN] thinking, you know, when we get into censorship it's really hard to draw a line --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and say, "Well, this one is okay, but this one isn't" --
R:  Yeah.  Well, I -- I -- I guess the censorship kind of um reflects our society and -- and society is kind of, I don't know who -- who leads ah you know, our -- our ah morays, um, it's society as a whole but, you know, sometimes, you know, it -- it -- you kind of just get swept along with the crowd --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- whether you um believe it or -- or not and -- and um yeah, I -- I guess there are -- are some problems with censorship, I -- I sort of think of um, um, puritan times when ah --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- you know, when um, you know, witchcraft was totally condemned and -- and ah people were [SIGH] um banned from reading --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- certain kinds of literature and -- and ah certainly that can be very ah um what -- what's the word I'm looking for?  Um, well, censorship in a way, I mean all kinds of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- censorship um, certain religions prevent you from um doing certain things or they ah channel you towards a ah certain way of thinking by what they allow and don't allow and ah, you know, sometimes even they influence your, well, you know, voting and -- and all kinds of --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- things, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I -- I guess we sort of -- I -- I don't know, but I -- I guess um censorship -- I -- I think it has it's good and bad points, see you need to strike a healthy balance.
L:  That's true. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's really true.  And I agree with you, I -- I do think, you know, we need to be careful what we're exposing our children to and I agree that swearing and -- and vi- ah you know, violence and things are not something I want to have ah my child have a constant diet of.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But um, I don't know, I think we have to be really careful who we're allowing to make those decisions because --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah --
L:  -- some people, like you say, have real extreme values --
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  -- and others are, you know, that would probably find fault with just about anything and then there's some --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that have such loose morals that, you know, anything's okay by them, so --
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.
L:  I think when we -- we're talking about censorship, then we have to be really careful that -- who is -- who's making those decisions for us --
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, it -- it's ah, yeah, [LAUGH] you kind of wonder who -- who are making these decisions and ah, well, um, I guess it's kind of -- boils down to time um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, how do you find out who's in -- who's in charge and -- and ah it does take time to ah research that sort of thing and ah get involved with that and ah um, yeah, I guess most people are just surviving [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I know that feeling.  I have a sister in law that's been a -- a elementary school librarian and they go through their books every so often and get rid of them, I g- --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- you know, it's not necessarily censorship, but in a way it kind of is because they take these books out of a library system, so they're no longer available and what determined which books they removed was how often they had been checked out --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- and -- and so the popular books -- and it could be, you know, dumb things like Yu-Gi-Oh or cartoon type things --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it -- it wasn't necessarily great literature, but it had been checked out a lot and so they would keep those --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but other books that maybe [MN] I -- I know one that they mentioned was something like um [LIPSMACK] oh, Brother Redfren [inaudible] that's a real sweet little story about a boy growing up with two dogs --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- you know --
R:  I think I remember something about that.
L:  -- and that one hadn't been checked out very much and so they got rid of that book.
R:  Oh gee.
L:  But um --
R:  Yeah, so, yeah, and you're right, that is a form of censorship and -- and it's kind of --
L:  Because they're not available once they've removed them from the library system --
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  -- and I thought that was kind of an odd way for the school to decide what's going to be available for the kids to read was how often it had been checked out and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it could be that, you know, just books hadn't been recommended, or weren't available by being placed on top of the shelves, or whatever --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so some of the better books were the ones they were getting rid of because they hadn't been checked out a lot --
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  -- I thought that was a real odd system.
R:  Yeah.  But I have never heard of that, so yeah, that -- that's [LAUGH] yeah, that -- that is in a way a censorship and then it's kind of lead by ah popularity, which ah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah, um, [SIGH] wow, that -- that's kind of interesting
