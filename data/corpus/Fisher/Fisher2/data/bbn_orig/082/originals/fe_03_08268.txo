L:  Well, my name is Bernard.
R:  I'm Theresa.
L:  Hi, Theresa.  How are you?
R:  Okay.
L:  And what do you think about the topic of the day?
R:  Well, I don't know [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  The -- it -- what did it say?  Forcing --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- children to -- to read specific books?
L:  Yes.
R:  Hm.  Well, I have mixed feelings.
L:  Well, so do I.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Now, because of my age, you know, they -- I don't feel like anything was forced upon me during the time I was growing up and going school but now things have changed so much it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- this X generation set up --
R:  Well, and -- and I -- I have a teaching degree.  I haven't taught for eleven years other than substituting while I was raising my kids now --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and so I'm kind of involved in it although I was elementary so I mean, I wasn't reading anything that shouldn't be read probably.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, and when I was in high school -- I graduated twenty one years ago --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- we've -- and I don't remember reading anything that was inappropriate or that we were forced to read.  So, I don't remember anybody coming and saying, "I can't read this, my parents won't let me" or anything either.
L:  Right.  And I didn't have that problem either.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Although I do know there have been some, um -- I think it was in a high school.  I live in a very small town but there was a high school somewhere around where the -- one of the kids just chose not to take -- to be in during that class and they had to read something else.
L:  Okay.
R:  The school didn't force them to read it.  They -- they gave him a -- uh, when I say optional assignment to do instead.  Their parents opted not to have them read that book but I don't remember what it was [LAUGH].
L:  Okay.
R:  So ...
L:  But you were given -- but the child was given the option though --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or the parents were.
R:  Yeah, the parents disapproved of the book or just thought it wasn't appropriate and they decided rather than force them to read it, they had the opportunity and -- or -- or take a zero on the class sort of thing.  For that --for that section they were doing they -- they were given an opportunity to do an optional assignment instead.
L:  Well --
R:  And so ...
L:  -- I know -- I -- I don't believe in -- in anything being forced --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, because then they won't learn.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, um, however, you know, if it's part of the regular curriculum and they don't know that there's a difference then they -- they don't get upset about it and they don't feel like they're forced to utilize the book or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [COUGH] or to read.
R:  And I suppose in the Catholic -- I think it said Catholic schools or religious schools, I can't remember what they worded -- how they worded the question, but in that case, when it's a private school and you're paying to go, I'm not sure.  It's -- it's a whole different situation --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, than a public school.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, that makes a whole another different [LAUGH] even set of things to think about.
L:  It really does.  Now, I've got -- well, see my -- my son, he's in college.  My daughter, she's only nine years old.
R:  I have a nine year old son, my youngest.
L:  Okay, and he -- oh, my -- well, he's -- he's okay.  Nothing was ever forced upon him either but with my daughter, she -- you know, she has options of different things to read and --and she loves to read so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, and I don't mind anything that she's been reading --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so now I'm in Washington State and I don't know if that has anything to do with -- you know, the curriculum here is -- is quite interesting.  I was born in California and raised --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in California.
R:  My husband was raised in California but we live in Nebraska right now.
L:  Okay [MN].  See, and I don't --
R:  So, we're in a very conservative state here so there's [LAUGH] --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- you know, there's a big diff- if -- if something in a school, someone finds out about it, you know, it -- the whole community knows about it here --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- you now, something I think is inappropriate but I guess--
L:  So, and then --
R:  Oh, go ahead.
L:  And they would speak up on it and then there wouldn't be any problem with -- with making a change then in --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- or okay.
R:  Or giving the kids an option to do a different assignment probably, and I guess what I think too, a lot of people -- well, we have kids -- um, good friends whose kids are home schooled and they don't want 'em exposed to that stuff but I feel like when they get out of their house, they're gonna be exposed to it some day --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so it's better to have a dialogue with your kids, talk about it and say, "Okay this is a book the school's gonna -- you know, if you know ahead of time, this is the book that school's having you read.  Let's talk about it before you read it" or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, maybe -- maybe the parents make sure that they know what's -- what's in there too and --
L:  Well, everything -- fortunately here everything is brought -- brought in and we have to sign, um, for their assignments that my daughter has during the week.  We have to sign each week and it's brought in to say whether or not we approve of what's happening and everything --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- which is good.  She's in a -- in an advanced learning school so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, that's a plus.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't know exactly how the rest of the system works here.  Her mother would be better to answer these questions because she -- she also manages a latch key program -- an after school program.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And they do reading, a lot of reading in that as well.  But I'm sure she's of the belief too that a child shouldn't be forced to read something especially if the parents disagree with it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, so --
R:  Well, that could be religious differences with it or, you know, just your moral belief whatever.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And then if you don't think -- I mean, I keep my kids from going to movies I don't think is appropriate for them or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- are appropriate so I guess I feel the same about other things.  I don't -- I don't let 'em go.  My kids are thirteen, eleven and nine.  I don't let them go off to an R rated movie with me so I guess I wouldn't let them read books if I didn't think they were appropriate but like I said, we have a school system like each grade in our school, in our whole town.  Like our school graduated like sixty kids this year [LAUGH] --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- so, it's a totally different situation here than in a city.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, we pretty -- and -- and when I substitute teach, I'm in the school system and I know what's kinda going on and what the kids curriculums are and everything so I'm -- I'm more involved than someone who's isn't in -- in the school system would be too.
L:  Right.
R:  I do know what's going on and ...
L:  Okay, which -- which gives you the -- you know, an advantage I think.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's one good thing, uh, about a -- a small school system --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because the parents are more involved in it.  Here, um, I don't know they [MN] -- the way the schools are set up here [COUGH] the class -- well, the class size is small for -- for my daughter's school --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- which is real fortunate.  There's only like sixteen to eighteen kids per class --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- whereas in some of the other public schools, there are some thirty or forty kids in a classroom.
R:  Yeah, and that's hard to manage [LAUGH].
L:  It is.  It really is.  So, this school, um, they have book fairs and they have reading days where I get a chance to go in and sit with the kids and -- and watch them read and then see the books that they have available and everything that they've shown me so far, I've been satisfied with.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But as far as my opinion of it is concerned, I would not like my child to be forced to read anything that -- that I was not satisfied with --
R:  Right and --
L:  -- them, you know, having that.
R:  -- I agree with that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I mean, I wouldn't want -- if it is something that could be controversial I would want the parents to be able to read it first or at least have some access to it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and then make a decision if they want their -- their children to read it or if they want to read it along with them, or talk about it, you know, whatever.  So, I guess -- I guess I kinda feel like they shouldn't be forced to but the -- the opportunity should be there for the parents to have some access first and --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and make the decision.  Get the parents involved.
L:  Now, we have -- we have to continue to talk for ten minutes on this subject.
R:  Well [LAUGH] it should go quickly.  Well, how's the weather there [LAUGH]?
L:  [LAUGH] Actually it's quite nice.  Uh, it's --
R:  Is it?
L:  -- it's a nice sunny day.
R:  Yeah, it was here too.
L:  In the sixties.
R:  Yeah, we were about ninety two so --
L:  Oh, well --
R:  -- a little bit warmer.
L:  Well, for Washington State this is a beautiful day.
R:  Is it?  No rain, huh?
L:  No rain.
R:  'Cause I have relatives that live there, um, something lake.  I can't think of the name of it.  Something lake.
L:  Uh, there's so many lakes here.
R:  Yeah, I know [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I've been up there --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and they get lots of rain.
L:  Yes.
R:  All the time.
L:  Yeah, that's why they call it -- call Seattle the Emerald City.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Emerald green all the time.
R:  Well, and we've had a lot of rain here compared to what we've had the last few years.  We've been in a bad drought and now we've -- we're above average so it's good.  It's actually green here this year --
L:  Well, we're actually --
R:  -- and not brown.
L:  -- below average.
R:  Excuse me?
L:  We're below average.
R:  You're below.  Well, we've got your rain.  Thank you.
L:  I guess so.
R:  Thank you, we needed it.
L:  [LAUGH] I know we're off the subject.  I hope that doesn't create a problem.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Well --
L:  [LAUGH] This is my first time having a conversation so I'm --
R:  Well, I guess what else is there with the censorship [LAUGH]?
L:  [LAUGH] Well, we're both in agreement.  Our mixed feelings have already come to a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- conclusion.  We've decided that it's okay if we have a choice.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But we don't want to have --
R:  Now, what would you think if it was a private school?
L:  Well, in --
R:  What do you think about there?  
L:  Well, in private --
R:  The same thing?
L:  Yeah, in -- well, in private schools I think they would give you more of an option. 
R:  Yeah, probably.
L:  Yeah.  Um, whereas in the public schools, they've -- they've set up a curriculum and --
R:  And the teachers have to follow it.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  So, it's probably a little different.
L:  So, in [LAUGH] here we go.  Well, it's good to hear your voice [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, let's see, um, I know there -- I do a lot of reading myself.
R:  What do you think about banned books then -- books -- what do you think of the opposite?  What about if they say, you can't have this book in the library?  We're not going to have this book.
L:  Well, in that case, then I would -- I would like to -- to be in touch with -- with more of the parents and have a chance to see how they all feel about it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then we can go from there.
