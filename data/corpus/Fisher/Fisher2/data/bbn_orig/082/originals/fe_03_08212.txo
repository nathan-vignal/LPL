L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, I'm Rochellene.
R:  I'm Kate.
L:  Hi Kate.
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  You too.
R:  Okay [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Oh, you want to -- you want to go first?  Go ahead.
L:  Okay.
R:  [MN]
L:  Um, well I -- I think really fundamentally the whole idea is silly because schools can forbid people from reading books and then people re- leave at three o'clock and can go read those books, so --
R:  Yeah, I think I mean I guess it depends on the grade level, too.  I think that certain things are inappropriate like I don't think dirty books should be read in school, but that's obvious --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that that -- that's pretty obvious more or less and especially in terms of private schools, I think parents know when they're sending their children what kind of materials their children are using in those schools --
L:  Yeah.  And --
R:  -- because I mean they choose to send them to those schools.  So, there I think there should be no censorship at all.
L:  Well, and that -- I mean, that's what people are -- are signing up for, you know.  If their parent is paying to send a kid to a religious school where they're going to ban Harry Potter, like the parents signing up for that, the school doesn't get government funding, it can do whatever it wants --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- you know, and gee we agree and we have nothing to say [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I know.  This is -- isn't it sad?  We need ten minutes of this, though.  But um it really bothers me when -- when like in those States down under they're, you know, they're saying that certain classical books are just dirty pornography when all it is is just like ridiculous, ridiculousness.  I mean, if children were that easily influenced, that they should, you know, not be allowed to watch the news and the rest of that stuff if a book can -- can, you know, do things that they say that it can.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, what -- what's amazing to me is I -- I mean I think it's getting worse and worse and I -- I don't know how old you are and I don't know to which degree this is my [inaudible] --
R:  I'm twenty one.
L:  Okay, I'm thirty.
R:  Okay.
L:  And like, there are all these books that I read as a kid that I don't remember there being an uproar about and that maybe because I was in New York and I was in private school, but like the stuff people forget about, I'm just like, I -- I don't -- I don't understand --
R:  Oh, what school did you go to? [LAUGH]
L:  I went to Hewitt.
R:  Oh, okay.  I went ah I went to a public school.  I went to Stuyvesant.
L:  I actually graduated from Stuyvesant. 
R:  Oh really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.  Wow.
L:  Okay.  Censorship --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- censorship, censorship, they're going to yell at us.  
R:  Yeah, I know.  I know.  Yeah, well, censorship.  Well, they didn't really s- our teachers, we read some pretty racy stuff, especially in my um [LIPSMACK] in the -- in the class.  I took a lot of kinda more left wing sort of courses, like philosophy, you know, things like that, so we read pretty ridiculous things there and we read some, you know, graphically not -- not very graphically sexual, but sort of along those lines books and it was totally fine.  I don't know --
L:  I remember at Stuyvesant when I was there, they had a gothic literature class and we read a -- we w- we read um Red Dragon which is about a serial killer --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that, you know, that like --
R:  Yeah, I saw the movie [LAUGH].
L:  -- t- yeah.  We read Red Dragon --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I was like fourteen, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean it -- what's funny though is I went through ah you know, I read this and that and you know, I read, I know why the caged bird sings --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- which is one of the controversial books when I was like in sixth grade and it didn't harm me and then I'm like, wait, you know, do people outside of New York, I'm exactly why people shouldn't be allowed to read those books.
R:  Yeah, you know, maybe those kids are that easily influenced because they don't see anything else, but I -- I don't know personally I guess living in New York, censorship is not a big issue at all.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I mean --
L:  It -- it just doesn't -- it doesn't really come up very much at all --
R:  No.
L:  -- I -- 
R:  I -- I don't know, yeah, it doesn't at all [LAUGH].
L:  But I'm sure it does like on local levels and on school board levels, but I used to think that something we're not exposed to, because we don't like have kids at school or anything, you know?
R:  I'm sure there's some very conservative parents that have problems with certain books, but in general, nobody I know does.  And if they do --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's the less educated people, you know, the more intelligent parents never really mind their children being open to those things, just because they know that their kids are going to be fine, even if they do read a little pornography, which it never is, but --
L:  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  Because the books that people get upset about i- you know, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- porn is like this [inaudible] thing, I mean --
R:  Catcher in the Rye?  I mean, how -- how often do you hear -- that's one of the most banned books.
L:  Which boggles my mind because among other things it's not very good.
R:  No, it's not very good at all.  I -- I didn't enjoy it whatsoever [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, it's that and like Harry Potter and I know a lot of kids [inaudible] and I don't even know what else, but --
R:  Yeah.  I think it comes from the same idea when people are saying that um the ah that, oh, Jesus, what was that cartoon show, they're saying there's a gay, ah -- ah --
L:  Oh, the Teletubbies?
R:  That's it.  Yeah.  Banning that because there's a gay Teletubby.  I mean, come on.  Like oh --
L:  Like, who has time to think about that?  I mean, that really --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that's the other thing.  Like the second you say to kids, "You can't read something" the first thing they're going to do when they walk out of that classroom --
R:  Of course.
L:  -- is go find that book.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And there's no question about that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I don't -- I don't understand like what -- what the issue is there.  At -- at all.
R:  Yeah.  Whatsoever.  I don't know.  But, see people are afraid if their children aren't that smart they could be influenced much easier than whereas if they're educated ah I don't know, plus a lot of parents don't want ideas being instilled in their children's heads that aren't ones that they approve of, they don't want them to think on their own, they want them to, you know, have the same ideas as them so I think that's where a lot of that comes from.
L:  But also, even like ideas they're unfamiliar with, because let's say you ban, you know, or a kid starts reading a book and you don't know if you agree with it or disagree with it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you don't know enough about it, you're like, "Oh, well, I can't help my kid being smarter than me --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- because then I can't like lay down X, Y or Z rule" --
R:  That's true.  That's very true.  Or like people who are racist, they don't want their kids, you know, taking black literature courses or -- or learning --
L:  Right.
R:  -- about Jewish people or the holocaust and all that stuff.  So, I guess that that -- that makes a lot of sense to them.
L:  Yeah.  Also, I think the censorship issue comes up a lot more in more homogeneous communities because people can also kind of agree on what their uncomfortable about.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And in New York, nobody could ever possibly --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- agree on what they're uncomfortable about.
R:  It's true.  And there's a huge consensus anywhere out of -- out of the cities, as to what people should and shouldn't be reading, so I don't know.
L:  Yeah.  I mean it's that whole like New York is a small island off the coast of America --
R:  Oh, yeah --
L:  -- I think, you know.
R:  -- we're -- we're not American whatsoever.  We're just a little country all on our own.  Yeah.  Us and a couple of other cities, I'd say, but besides that.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's -- it's very -- it's -- it's very strange because like I used to travel a lot for business and I'd go -- I went to New Orleans for something one time and I like turn up in a black suit --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and they're like, "Are you from New York?" I'm like --
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  Uh-oh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know.  And -- and people I do know from other places are like, "Oh my God, we never would have been allowed to read that in school" and not just things, you know, that "Ooh, witchcraft, sexual [inaudible] or whatever" but like you know they weren't allowed to read George Orwell in school --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- because people might question authority.
R:  Jesus.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That -- that's insane.  But then they go home and watch the same movies that we watch.  I don't know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and their parents let them do that and and all those other horrible things.  Like you see it on the news anyway, please, it's all the same stuff and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- online, like with the Internet now, what can't you read if you wanted to?
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.
R:  [MN]
L:  I mean, I- I- and of course that's the other big issue, you know, should schools allow internet, whatever --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I sort of feel really grateful that I was in school before the Internet boom because I didn't have to like listen to inane people telling me what was good for me.
R:  It's true.  But also it's -- it's kind of like with the Internet now, it's -- they make us do so much research that I really don't want to do and like I -- I've copied and pasted half my papers.  I'll be honest.
L:  Yeah, I think a lot of people --
R:  Now that I can [LAUGH] --
L:  -- do.
R:  Yeah.  We all do, but, um, go back to censorship.  So --
L:  Right.  Right.  [LAUGH].
R:  That -- God, this is a long ten minutes, isn't it?
L:  Well, when both people agree on the issue and don't, you know, confront it on a daily basis --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think, you know, that it really -- it really is [inaudible] and I -- and I don't think that our views, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- are that common if you look at it on -- on a national level, I mean school -- I mean, is a school to educate or is a school to impose order?  If a school's to impose order, censorship --
R:  It's also like --
L:  -- is necessary --
R:  -- what you define as education and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- different people think it's very different things, so I guess wherever you go and that's what it's going to depend on.
L:  Right.  And it also depends on, you know, how you define censorship --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because everybody like throws this word around like, you know, "Schools don't have a right to do this".  Well, you know what, private schools do have a right to censor.  They're -- they're private --
R:  They definitely do.
L:  -- institute and whatever.  It's -- public schools and actually I have a friend who's a teacher and there are like huge lists of like words that aren't allowed in books that are read --
R:  Oh my god.
L:  -- in school and ideas and topics and like she had to send permission slips home because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like there was witchcraft in a book --
R:  Yeah, you can't teach evolution --
L:  -- she was assigning --
R:  -- right, because yeah a lot of schools --
L:  Well, I think you can here, but I know some places you can't.
R:  No, in New York, yeah, but you -- you can't in a lot of States, I think they don't allow that because they say it goes against you know the whole Godly thing and they don't want that in their children's minds, thinking that it -- that God was created otherwise than they've been taught in the Bible, which is so silly, ah --
L:  I -- I don't --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I don't understand, I mean, everybody complains about how bad the American education system is and for the most part they're right, it's horrible --
R:  It is.
L:  -- and yet we do everything in our power to make sure it stays that way by discouraging questioning and discouraging learning, but discouraging reading.  I mean, the odds are, as I said, like well you censor something at school, the kids will run out and buy it.  No they won't, kids don't read.
R:  Yeah.  It -- and that's very true.
L:  You know?  I mean they ti- they do more now and it's all Harry Potter's fault.  But like kids don't read, really.
R:  They read porno.
L:  You know?  Yeah.
R:  They read lots of that.
L:  Yeah.  And they -- they read like, you know, their illiterate chats --
R:  The seventeen magazines and --
L:  -- on the Internet.
R:  -- yeah.  I -- I read a lot of those as well.  Unfortunately, but --
L:  Yeah, I mean -- yeah.
R:  Mm.
L:  I mean although when I went to school we had a required summer reading list, so like over the summer there were all these books we had to read and we'd get tested on them --
R:  Really?  We only had it in junior high.
L:  -- or stay back.
R:  Not in high school.
L:  Oh -- yeah, not at Stuyvesant, but like at my private school we had that.
R:  Oh.  Okay.
L:  Um and that -- we had it for every grade and -- and that was the thing, like they sent a list to your parents so A your parents knew what you were supposed to be doing and made sure you did it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but it was also very much to have to choose books off this list the parents knew that they were uncomfortable with something like not to let you read it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- which was like --
R:  That's a really good way to go.
L:  -- so sort of weird, but definitely less intrusive than the school deciding what was okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And what wasn't.
R:  And I hate it when they -- when they like teachers get in trouble for it.  It's so horrible when you see those things, it just upsets --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- me a lot, especially teachers that are trying to like get children to learn on their own, which is really hard to do with kids these days, nobody wants to learn anything --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if they don't have to.  They'd rather sit in front of
