L:  Sarah. [NOISE] 
R:  Hi, I'm Jessica. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [PAUSE] Sarah?
L:  Yes. [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, okay.  So we're supposed to talk about whether or not public schools should ban books?
L:  Yeah, I think so.  Okay.  What do you think?
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I went to public schools and they [MN] -- there were Catholic schools in our area that banned the books --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and in talking to my friends that went -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- to the private schools versus, like, the stuff that we read in public schools, I think that we got a much broader education [NOISE] because of that.
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.  I dunno, what do you think?
L:  I think, um, that okay, you can't really just say, "Sure, certain books can be banned" but then again I don't know how I would feel if my child was reading, [NOISE] you know, The Rise and Fall of The Third Reich.  I mean, s- er, it's -- the problem is there are certain books that I [SIGH] don't think that people should be allowed to read, but [SIGH] then again I also don't believe in -- in banning books because I think that's [SIGH] fascist and can never really be a good thing so, [LIPSMACK] I'm -- I guess I would take the more liberal route and just suck up the consequences of it.
R:  I agree.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  We -- I think that there's a lot to be said for --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- be- [inaudible] read a book and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [inaudible] to the student to accept whether or not [MN] this is true --
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  -- based on -- 
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  -- the belief the student has, like --
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] Right.  I mean, yeah, it's also -- right, it's very important that, you know, I would want [NOISE] my kids to have an open mind and not be scared and think that certain things are forbidden to be read, you know, 'cause why w- -- I'm scared what's gonna happen to them when they read it.  You know, what kinda  [PAUSE] 
R:  Yeah -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and talk to her, and I'd like to get time --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the [several inaudible words] like The Lord of the Flies --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- Huckleberry Finn, and there is nothing wrong with those books.  I don't [several inaudible words] at all.
L:  [SIGH] Right -- right.  No, I definitely -- I definitely agree.  Um.  [NOISE] Yeah --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- I mean, [SIGH] there are schools now that [NOISE] ban Harry Potter and the likes, you know.  People -- anyone has an issue with anything, they -- they feel like they can just [NOISE] sit in and legislate for people.  Yeah, I'm really not into legislating [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] um, personal issues like that, I guess.
R:  Yeah.  I'm --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- not really so much either.  'Course, like the [NOISE] Harry Potter [NOISE] stuff, sure there's like --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- fantasy and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- wizards and all that, but, it's just -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- like, it's entertainment --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it'll -- it's better entertainment than, like, watching --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- Power Rangers or --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- something like --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that.
L:  Right -- right.  The same people who would ban it, probably would let their kids watch, God knows what, on the television, like, five hours a day, you know? [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.  I agree. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Do you have children that --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- are in public --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- school? [NOISE] 
L:  [MN] No.  I'm twenty five.  I don't --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- have any kids. [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.
L:  I was just trying to think that, you know, if --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, this were a right situation then --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, when I was in school nothing was really banned so that, I mean, like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- definitely a good thing.  I don't -- I can't really remember -- I mean, I think people --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- got kind of upset about reading the book Forever --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- by Judy Blume [SIGH] --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- but I totally disagree with that 'cause it --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- was a great story so  
R:  Yeah.
L:  But now -- but now everything's different.  I mean, when I was in school like, ten, fifteen years ago, so  people are much -- people I think -- I think are overly cautious now.
R:  [NOISE] Like, I'm not sure if they're overly --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- cautious or if they're --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- more willing --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- for, like, a broader spectrum.
L:  Oh.  Maybe. [NOISE] 
R:  I don't know.  Like, we had to read the Communist --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- Manifesto --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- last -- er, two years ago.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, that's cool.
R:  Yeah, it was --
L:  Yeah, I think that's cool. [NOISE] 
R:  -- [inaudible] -- it was really cool.  And at first, like, I --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- know my parents worried a little bit -- were --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- guarded 'bout me reading about Communism and stuff like that, but at --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the same point [SIGH] I wasn't --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- going to embrace [NOISE] Communism [LAUGH] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- because I was reading about it.
L:  Right.  You didn't run off to Russia or China and -- and join. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.  But, like, now I --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- know about it, and there's actually a lotta points --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- about it that, like, make sense.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  I mean it's kinda like -- 
L:  And I think -- I think -- yeah.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  There are good things to be said, sure -- [NOISE] having an open mind about these things. [NOISE] 
R:  I agree.  [SIGH] [NOISE] [SIGH] 
L:  Um, hm.  What else?
R:  Yeah, so  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  How many -- how much time do you think we've eaten up here?
L:  Four minutes tops. [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  But, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I don't know, whether any, like, controversial books that --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you have read?
L:  Controversial books I have read.  [NOISE] Well, no.  Not really.  I mean, I don't really  uh I think, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings maybe had -- there was some controversy in it because it had, like, sexually explicit material in it [NOISE] --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- um, and, yeah, I mean, whatever, maybe it wasn't appropriate because we were fourteen when we read it but, [NOISE] please -- like, people don't see it on television or anywhere else.
R:  Or the kids don't talk about it in the hallway anyway.
L:  Yeah, like, so ... yeah, I think -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- yeah, I think, th- the more I talk about it the more I realize that [NOISE] I -- I just don't think books should be banned.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I dunno, but you're right.  It is pretty fascist.  It's like the Nazis [NOISE] burning the books or [LAUGH] something like that.
L:  Yeah, that's exactly what it is. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.  Well, what about the Bible as a book --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- used in school then?  How do you feel about --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that?
L:  [SIGH] Right, and [MN] there is the great question.  It's [MN] one of the -- is that like, [NOISE] is that saying one religion is okay or is it, [MN] you know, choosing one religion?  'Cause I know certain schools, [LIPSMACK] um, University of Mount Carmel actually made all their freshmen read this book about Islam I think --
R:  Really?
L:  -- like, because -- because I think after nine eleven they thought that, you know, people really needed to understand it or whatever, so that's what they had.  Not like a big deal, and everyone's like, "Why are you doing this?  You know, this is saying that Islam is okay and not everyone agrees with it" and all this stuff; saying that if you read something [MN] then that means that you support it, which I don't think is true.
R:  I don't think that's true either because --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- if you read it and understand it then you're able to --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- actually make a decision whether or not --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you do believe in it or not.
L:  Right.  Exactly.  Which -- which I totally agree with but when people -- people get really scared about -- about things like that, that's the problem.  It's that -- that p- -- a lotta people make [several inaudible words] just fear what will happen if people -- [NOISE] if people actually knew things, you know, then, "Oh no, they can [NOISE] make up their own minds". [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, I agree.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Like, it's almost like people --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- are scared of knowledge.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Like people are scared of the information because --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- if [SIGH] they have the information about --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- something they don't know about, like, say --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you're +prejudiced against, like, Islamic people --
L:  Right.
R:  -- then -- then -- but at the same --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- point, like, you won't read the Koran and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you won't --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- research --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- Islam or anything like that, like --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you don't really have anything to base your judgement on and if they --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- find out that -- well, they might agree --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- with certain aspects --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- of that faith or that culture, then --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it's [NOISE] scary because, all of a sudden, like, people are forced to make decisions and change things that they're scared ab- uh, that --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that they have, like, prejudice against --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- or [SIGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or [NOISE] -- I dunno. [NOISE] 
L:  People just write off, you know, what they're really scared about and then think that, [NOISE] "Oh, you know, [NOISE] as long as I know anything about it" [MN] it's like ignorance is bliss, [NOISE] but [NOISE] -- I'm sorry -- I disagree.  I think that people shouldn't be scared of knowing anything.  Um.  Especially when it comes to things like other people's beliefs.  I mean, how could we not want to know about what, like -- how many people are in Islam?  Like, ten million?  Like, how [MN] -- what they [NOISE] -- what they believe. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.  Like, there's so many [NOISE] standards. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I dunno, like.  [NOISE] And still you'll --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- build a --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- better tolerance too. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  People have knowledge of --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- one another and can --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- learn and accept and understand where the other people are coming from too.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  [NOISE] But I think most people probably don't and are [NOISE] scared for [NOISE] prejudice reasons and [NOISE] it's sad. [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. 
L:  That's our world today. [SIGH] 
R:  That's kinda sad.
L:  Huh? [NOISE] 
R:  Nobody even [inaudible] -- I said, "That's really sad".
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  [NOISE] It's awful.  [NOISE] I mean, ah, um.  [NOISE] Why'd they have to give us such a sad topic?
R:  Hm.  Hm hm hm hm hm hm hm.
L:  [NOISE] Um, hm.  Hey, we got one more minute.
R:  Yeah.  What about --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- language?  I know some books, they were, like, edited --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- versions because it might say like "fuck" or "shit" or something like that --
L:  [SIGH] Ah, yes. [NOISE] 
R:  -- and like, what do you -- how do you feel about using, like, cuss words?
L:  [SIGH] I -- I dunno.  I think when things are in, you know, vernacular and how they were originally written there's -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- there the author's intent is very important and I think even things like, [NOISE] even like older books or like religious books probably have words that back then were probably really bad [NOISE] but to us now they're not.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  But we still read them.  You know, just because we're reading "shit" from the fifteenth century -- it was called something else -- we still read it now.  [NOISE] I don't know, I think it's important [NOISE] to -- to see what [NOISE] the author was really getting at. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, I do too.  And it --
L:  I mean, granted I don't think that the kids should be reading, [NOISE] I dunno --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- dirty magazines or [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, but there's like, I -- I -- I agree, and I think that the author --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- chose what they were writing or, if they didn't choose it then it came out of them naturally and it was --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- an expression --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- from the author and it's a piece of art --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- like a piece of literature --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- so it shouldn't be --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- affected by people who are close minded.
L:  [NOISE] Right.  And this is -- this is also like a freedom of art, freedom of expression kinda -- kinda question. [NOISE] 
R:  Yes it is.
L:  Because literature is just like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- a painting or song or a sculpture, and everyone's interpretations are different so [NOISE] who is anyone to say what they should or shouldn't do [NOISE] with it?
