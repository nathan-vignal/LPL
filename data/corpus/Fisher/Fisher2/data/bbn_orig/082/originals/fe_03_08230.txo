R:  Hi, I'm Nona.
L:  Hi.  I'm Penny.
R:  I didn't hear a tone.  Did you hear a tone?
L:  No.  And you know what?  I heard what was our opinions on public and private school -- what was it?  I couldn't even hear it.
R:  Mm.  Can forbid, should or should be allowed to forbid, or should forbid students to read certain books.
L:  Oh, is that what it was?
R:  -- and they -- yeah.  They announced the topic first of censorship and then --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they got specific on -- on that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, so I was all prepared to deal with censorship in a broad way, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  I was too, but [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Um, I, you know, and I guess I am -- I'm again- it -- on general principles and in specific kind of in favor of it, like I heard that Wal Marts was like covering up certain magazines, it was a bit of ah not family material and I thought that was not a bad idea at all, really.
L:  Yeah.  Wal Mart has always been very on top of that stuff, though.
R:  Yeah.  And they say --
L:  I --
R:  -- it's a business decision, you know, w- which is how they defend it, they say it's not -- not a first amendment issue, they say it's a business thing, so --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Um, but on -- on the books thing, gosh.  I mean, whenever I hear about such a case, you know, I have to say that I thought that it was wrong because they were always banning these books that I personally am in favor of people reading, for instance like the Harry Potter books, some of -- some schools have actually banned them because they allegedly promote witchcraft and stuff --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like that.
L:  Right. 
R:  Um, or, you know, other people that have -- have -- have -- have banned, I mean there have even been cases where Huckleberry Finn was banned --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because um, you know, suppose -- you know, it uses the word "nigger" --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, and um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and they have a point, but I mean you can't ban -- ban one of the great works of American literature, you know --
L:  Exactly.  Yeah.
R:  -- so, um --
L:  Well, my oldest is going to be six in September, so she hasn't really reached that point yet.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, to where [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.  So, you have a -- but you have a definite stake in this issue because you have school age children, so --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I guess, yes, I think, you know, ah forbids a student -- I don't know if forbid, but, you know, they don't like they should be allowed, I think, maybe to not, you know, have the books for library, for instance I mean one wouldn't w- --think that, you know, if they somebody chose to donate a collection of erotic literature to the local --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- elementary school, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that they should have to put them on the shelves.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, you know, there's just no need for that to be foisted upon kids or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, put in front of their faces.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I'm not even sure what they said.  Did they say, allow, forbi- did they say, what did they say?  What are we supposed to be talking about here?  With this, you know, did they say that sc- should schools be permitted to ba- forbid students to read certain books?  I mean, if the parents, on the other hand, say it's okay they w- and they want --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- their kids to be reading that kind of stuff, you know, hey, you know --
L:  Where do you draw the line?
R:  -- it's a free world, you know.
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, there is a wide spectrum of, you know, parental permissiveness in that regard, like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I've known people who have said um, you know, that they want their kids to know what's out there --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and so they sit and watch it with them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, you know, if I were raising children, I don't think that that would be my approach, I think I would tend to, you know, try to impart to them that, you know, that there are things that they're probably better off not -- not watching because they're um, you know, disturbing and whatever.
L:  You know, it also might also depend on where they're being raised at, too.
R:  You mean like --
L:  Because the inner city kids are going to be so much more subjected to stuff --
R:  Right.  And it's so unesc- inescapable, right --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH] Yeah, but --
L:  You know, where, you know, kids in a totally different part of the country are not going to be subject to those same things.
R:  Yeah.  That's true.
L:  So --
R:  L- [LAUGH] Lucky country kids.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Although it's like there is so much information out there these days and with the Internet and such --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, it really sort of all of it kind of reaches everywhere, you know --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean there's -- there is access if -- if people -- people want it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you know ...  So, should they be able to forbid their students to read this stuff?  No.  I don't think so, but that doesn't mean they have to, you know, make it available to them either.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  You know.
L:  Applied in the library.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, um, as I -- as I've gotten older, I find myself with le- less inclination to, you know, I mean I don't like violent movies anymore for instance --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I mean, I just don't enjoy them, I --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  I want to see something that makes me laugh and ma- makes me feel happy and stuff, not --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- something like that.
L:  Yeah.  I just walked in the door probably fifteen minutes ago from going and seeing Finding Nemo --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So -- [LAUGH]
R:  You s- you -- you saw it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Did you enjoy it?
L:  Yes, I did it.
R:  [LAUGH] I haven't seen it yet.  You -- did you take -- take your daughter to see it?
L:  I took my -- my four year old little boy, because he's more --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- he'll watch a movie, whereas my five year old little girl won't [LAUGH].
R:  She doesn't want to s- want to sit still that long, huh?
L:  Right.  But he sat through the whole thing and he really enjoyed it too.  So ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  N- --
L:  But it was good.
R:  Good.  Good.
L:  You know.
R:  And the -- and they're air conditioned, which is ah --
L:  Yes [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  We had a -- well, when we went in, it was raining pretty hard here.
R:  Oh really?
L:  It was pouring.  And then when we came out, the sun was shining and everything was dried up and [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  So, I was like, "Oh, okay" [LAUGH].
R:  Your timing was good.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  To sit out the storm.  Well, it's just humid where I am, ah --
L:  Yeah?
R:  Yeah.  And I don't know if that affects my views on censorship in schools or not, ah --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, we get that humid weather too, pretty bad.  [MN]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]  Hm.
R:  Well, um, it comes with the summer territory.  I mean, I guess there are places that aren't terribly humid, like the south west and stuff, but they're -- they're so darn hot.  I mean --
L:  Right.
R:  -- friends out in Tucson and they say it can get like to a hundred and twenty or something, I can't even imagine.
L:  I -- I can't either.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, when it's ninety, I'm like, "Okay, that's it" [LAUGH].
R:  I know.  Run inside and turn the air conditioner on, for sure.
L:  Mhm.  Hide from it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, you're so lucky to be ha- you -- to have kids that age.  I have grandkids that age.
L:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It's fun.
L:  yeah.
R:  They're -- they're a lot of fun.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  A lot of work, but --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  A lot of -- lot of running after them and keeping up with them, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  S- 
L:  You know.
R:  Soon they'll be off on their own.  You know what I was noticing -- and this is like really off topic -- and I guess that's okay, I mean what can they do?  They can't really stop us, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I've noticed like my, you know, in my grandkids' neighborhood, which is like a suburban neighborhood --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you never seen kids playing in the yard and I was -- I was meaning to ask my like son and daughter in law if they were a- you know, if um -- if they -- if they remember playing outside a lot.  Because when I was a kid --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, you just -- you just went out --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they tell me they do not go -- let their kids go out in the yard without somebody watching them now.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Huh.
R:  And I was like -- I was shocked.  And it must be the whole neighbor- neighborhood, because I don't see kids riding around on their bikes and stuff, you know.
L:  Is it like in a subdivision, or just pretty --
R:  No, it's ah -- it, well, I don't know if you'd call it a subdivision or not, it's sort of a -- sort of a pricey ah kind of neighborhood outside of Washington DC --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] but like they're so, you know, paranoid about something happening to their kids, you know, and I mean I can kind of understand it because I mean it would just ruin your entire life --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but still, on the other hand, you know, it seemed like at some point you need to like let go a little bit --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and give kids some, you know, a little bit of a leash, but I mean I remember my parents warning me about a lot of things, you know --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- don't talk to strangers, never, never, ever, under no circumstances whatsoever in any event will you ever get into the car with a stranger --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know?  I mean, this kind of is off the topic of -- of censorship, but it's kind of on the topic of danger to kids --
L:  Right.
R:  -- which is I guess one of the things that people are trying to protect kids from with trying to keep them from reading certain things, you know, misguidedly or
