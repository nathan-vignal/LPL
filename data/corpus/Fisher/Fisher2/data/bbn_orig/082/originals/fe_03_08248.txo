R:  [NOISE] Hi, this is Paula.
L:  This is Michelle.
R:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] Hi, Michelle.  How are you?
L:  [MN] I'm good.  How are you?
R:  [NOISE] Okay.
L:  I haven't done one of these yet.  Have you?
R:  [NOISE] Oh, four.  Four or five of them. [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay [LAUGH] so you know the ropes.
R:  [NOISE] Come into the long time --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- [SIGH] ah but our topic of today is uh -- [NOISE] 
L:  [MN] 
R:  [NOISE] -- do -- do we believe --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] -- that or do we agree --?  [NOISE] Well, what our opinion is on whether a child should be able t- -- be permitted to read whatever they want, [SIGH] ah, in a public or private school.  Is that the topic? [NOISE] 
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay.  [SIGH] [NOISE] Um, I think they should. [NOISE] 
L:  I think they should too. 
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Wow. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.
L:  Oh.
R:  As to the reasons why -- I -- I -- I just think freedom of speech as well as [MN] the ability to read anything you want at any time.  I -- I -- [NOISE] I can't imagine [SIGH] um subjecting a child to um limited reading of any kind so ... because so few children read today at all [SIGH] so, to me you know, words on a page are just so exciting. [NOISE] 
L:  Yup.  And it teaches them a lot if they're exposed to different types of, you know, information.
R:  [NOISE] Absolutely.  Ah, I -- I think I would compare it to giving them access to the internet although there are things on there that just complete junk and garbage. [SIGH] Um, what do you do? [NOISE] 
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] You know, um.  It -- it's available.  There's some great things about the internet as well so [SIGH] I -- I would put it up there you know with the internet but [SIGH] um -- [NOISE] 
L:  Ano- -- 
R:  [NOISE] -- reading, you know, I think you know -- I -- I learned to read through comic books and I'm not even a comic book lover -- [NOISE] 
L:  Mhm mm.
R:  -- but whenever I would see one down there it was like, "Hey, that's a new word.  Let's see.  Let's look at that".
L:  Right.
R:  Um, [NOISE] I don't know.  What do you think? [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.  W- -- I went to a Catholic school my whole life so nothing was ever censored --
R:  [NOISE] [MN] [NOISE] 
L:  -- so when you hear -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- when I hear things like that being censored in public schools it's always a surprise to me 'cause that wasn't -- in growing up there wasn't ever anything that you know we had to really deal with or worry with.
R:  [NOISE] Exactly, exactly.  Wow.  And if they don't censor anything in -- in a Catholic school you can imagine -- I went to public school --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- all my life so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] -- um I -- I -- just like I say, I can't even imagine.  We didn't have as many books, um, and so anything we got to read was uh something that we really cherished. [NOISE] 
L:  Right.  You wrapped the kids' minds around it.
R:  [NOISE] Absolutely, absolutely.  [SIGH] I can't imagine even in- -- [NOISE] even instructors uh wanting to limit a child's -- or censor that uh -- what they can read.
L:  Right.
R:  I can't imagine. [NOISE] 
L:  Well, especially books.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  It's different with other things that could hurt children but --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, books is j- -- are just the way o- the word.
R:  [NOISE] Absolutely, absolutely.  No matter what the content sometimes. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right, right.
R:  Because I -- I think it prepares you for the real world.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] You know, some of um [NOISE] the [NOISE] language that I -- I see on television or hear just you know walking down the street [SIGH] shocks me.
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  Um, so if -- since it -- it is used frequently you might as well see it on a page.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] So at least you know how to spell it. [NOISE] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Ooh.
R:  You know, and -- and then maybe you -- you will then [NOISE] take the next step and look at the de- -- definition of it.  [SIGH] And I think that words [LIPSMACK] uh, for many people -- actually did you read the newspaper today regarding [SIGH] um -- [NOISE] 
L:  I -- I haven't read the paper today, no.
R:  [NOISE] Oh.  There's a -- there was a child in a small town in ah Pennsylvania [LIPSMACK] who -- they're [MN] claiming that he was about to, um, [NOISE] do another uh Columbine. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh.
R:  [NOISE] And um, whether that's a true story or not this is what was in the paper.  What was interesting about it is that here's a child th- -- and his family -- that have been teased all his life.  And you know, [MN] to me, taking away the [NOISE] strength of words also means something.  Y- -- you know?  So, I mean he had it -- like a cleft pallet.  I think it was a younger brother -- and he had a lisp and i- -- [NOISE] I guess the children were just brutal.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So until he was eighteen -- I guess he turns eighteen -- he decides, "You know what?  [NOISE] I've had enough of these torturers and I'm just going to do something about it today" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and so he prepares himself.  And he goes out you know, with all this ammunition and loaded guns and he went to hunt for them.  Thank God one of them -- he was about to um -- [NOISE] he had been a tormentor -- saw him --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- with two other members and ran off in a car -- drove off in a car and went to the police station.  [SIGH] That's the only way he got caught.
L:  Wow.
R:  And when they found him he had like two thousand [LAUGH] rounds of ammunition.
L:  Oh my gosh.
R:  Can you imagine? [SIGH] 
L:  No, no.
R:  And so, you know you talk about reading and words and -- and this was a straight A student. [NOISE] 
L:  Wow.
R:  [NOISE] Straight A.  [SIGH] But I -- you know, the torture that he felt all these years and his -- his mother had died when he was nine -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- raised by a single father.  It was very [NOISE] tough and you know and you turn that back to books.  He was a very bright child [SIGH] who [NOISE] let words harm him like that.  He just couldn't take away the strength of words.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  And -- and that's [LIPSMACK] -- [NOISE] I don't know.  I can't even imagine -- [NOISE] 
L:  No.
R:  [NOISE] -- what he went through, you know? [NOISE] 
L:  Very sad.
R:  [LIPSMACK] It is.  [NOISE] And so you know take -- eliminate a kid from anything --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know reading and talking and chatting and talking about and talking about how words are just words.  That's what they are.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um [NOISE] you know, any censorship of any kind [NOISE] can really cause harm to, I think, [NOISE] a child an adult, anyone.
L:  Yeah.  I agree.  And not -- not --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- even just about books, but just in general.
R:  [NOISE] Sure.  Absolutely.  Wow. [LIPSMACK] I dunno. [NOISE] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Do you have children? [NOISE] 
L:  I am pregnant right now.
R:  Oh.
L:  And now I d- -- I have two on the way. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, y- -- are you s- -- you're having twins?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Oh, God bless.  That's wonderful.
L:  Thank you.
R:  Oh, oh boy.
L:  You have children?
R:  [NOISE] Uh yes, adults. [NOISE] 
L:  Okay.
R:  [LAUGH] Three.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh, [MN] two boys and a girl. [NOISE]
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  And -t funny because [NOISE] two of the three [NOISE] are teachers -- [NOISE] 
L:  Oh are they?  Well, [inaudible] 
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] and one is in law school.  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  So y- -- it's a funny -- I know if they were on this call they'd be talking forever.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, "Oh, what are you talking Mum?" 
L:  Yeah.
R:  "My students, they'd -- " that's all I hear all the time -- "My students -- ". [SIGH] I said, "Boy, [NOISE] you would think that you guys w- -- were in -- in private school because you just love -- in love with your students" -- they -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but they're getting a kick out of it.  They love it.
L:  Aw.  Neat.
R:  And maybe they haven't been teachers long enough you think?  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Two years I gather isn't long enough.
L:  Oh.  My little sister is getting ready to be a teacher.  This is her first year --
R:  [NOISE] Really? [NOISE] 
L:  -- she's really excited so --
R:  And she's really excited.  
L:  -- and I know she's --
R:  Exactly.  [NOISE] Let's talk to her in about five years.
L:  [LAUGH] She might have a different opinion and [several inaudible words] --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- this is a big thing on her [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um -- on her mind.  She worries about it.  She worries more about in the public schools if the kids can't like --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- you know [SIGH] um pledge allegiance to the flag and you know, things like that.
R:  [NOISE] Exactly.  Exactly, yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  She really worries about that.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, an- I -- an- I uh is -- what grade is she going to teach? [NOISE] 
L:  Um, she's third grade I think it's going to be.
R:  Oh.  I love that grade. [NOISE] 
L:  So, it's the little ones.
R:  Yeah I love that grade.  [NOISE] I think that's a great grade. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] My sister -- actually many of my sisters are teachers and I know most of them are in high school and they tell me all kinds of crazy stuff.  You know, tires are blown out and crazy stuff --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when they give a student a bad grade and this is public school.
L:  Yeah, I'm glad she's not gonna teach at a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- high school --
R:  Yeah, it's really rough.
L:  -- in the scary world we live in today.
R:  Exactly.  Now I'm sure in -- in public schools they'd like us to probably take some of the books out of there but I don't -- I don't know if I [LIPSMACK] truly believe that what you read or what you see on the telly [LIPSMACK] is something that you will turn into action.  
L:  [MN] 
R:  I -- I -- and I'm not sure.  I -- I -- you know, I think about it all the time but I'm not sure. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] You know?  Um --
L:  You hear studies that say one thing and then --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- studies that say another.
R:  Exactly.  What do you think? [NOISE] 
L:  Well, and even with the video games the --
R:  Y- --
L:  -- same way.
R:  [NOISE] You think if you read something that, you know, you can turn that into an action?  [NOISE] It -- it stimulates something in your head that says, "Just go out and do this"?
L:  Mhm.  Yeah. 
R:  [NOISE] I --
L:  I don't know.
R:  [NOISE] I dunno.  You know?  I -- I -- I don't know.  I -- you know, when you speak for yourself, I've never read something and decided I wanted to do that.  Other than exercise.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I may read something --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- about exercise and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- "Oh, I think I'll do that tomorrow".
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH] But to harm someone or to do something that could [NOISE] potentially cause me harm?  I've never [NOISE] had that desire.
L:  Yeah, no.
R:  I -- I just -- [NOISE] you know?  Or, you know, lyrics from a -- a, you know, song.  I never thought about that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] You know?  So ... [NOISE] 
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] I dunno.  [SIGH] So, what do you do?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, I'm a -- I'm an account executive at a brand identity firm.  I have a degree in marketing.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, okay. [NOISE] 
L:  And actually yesterday was my first day back to work.  I had to take the first three months off because --
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] 
L:  -- I was so ill with the pregnancy so ...
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I'm -- I'm Director of Marketing and --
L:  [MN] 
R:  [NOISE] -- Regulatory Affairs --
L:  Okay [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and I work for Telecom companies --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- so [SIGH] r- -- I'm sitting here actually rolling out a product today. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh [LAUGH] are you? [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.
R:  [NOISE] So that should be fun. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh boy, that's exciting. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's -- that's really, really exciting. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.  I've done it -- I've worked there for eight years actually 'cause I started as an intern in college so --
R:  Uh okay.  [NOISE] That's great.  That's a great way to start. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Sure, sure. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Are you on the east coast? [NOISE] 
L:  Um no.  I'm in Cincinnati. 
R:  [NOISE] Oh okay. [NOISE] 
L:  So.
R:  I kn- -- I ah -- [SIGH] my old company I worked for was headquartered [NOISE] in -- oh, they had a location in Columbus and ah Cin- -- Cincinnati and Cleveland actually --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- all three.  [NOISE] [SIGH] And so uh -- I'm not there anymore um, but ah um [NOISE] they're still there.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, that company's still around.  Ah.  But I -- I only would go down there [NOISE] maybe once a quarter -- [NOISE] 
L:  Okay.
R:  [LIPSMACK] -- 'cause we headquarter out of New York. [NOISE] 
L:  Okay, is that where you're at now?
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  New York?  Okay.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.  [LIPSMACK] I headquarter here.  [SIGH] Um, so again this is your first time -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- on one of these calls.
L:  I've never been -- every time they've called I haven't been home so I haven't been able --
R:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] 
L:  -- to take a call yet.
R:  [NOISE] I haven't -- one -- one day I wasn't here [LIPSMACK] and they hadn't called me for a while so like, "I guess they'd got upset --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- I wasn't home today".
L:  Yeah.
R:  And um this is the first time they've called me in [NOISE] at least a month and a half, [NOISE] 'cause normally -- this is -- this'll be my fifth call. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, wow.  See I've only -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I guess I maybe signed up three weeks ago or so.
R:  [NOISE] Okay, okay.  Very good, uh, yeah. 
L:  I've kind of lost track of time and I've been sick.  Who knows how long ago it was. [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] Oh, I'm so happy for you.
L:  Thank you.
R:  [MN] Are you -- do you know what the -- [NOISE] the gender is?
L:  N- -- n- -- no, we don't know for sure.  For t- -- in two weeks we find out for sure so I'm only -- I'm eighteen weeks pregnant right now --
R:  [NOISE] Okay.
L:  -- f- -- four and a half months.
R:  Do you have any preference? [NOISE] 
L:  You know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- as sick as I was it might be nice to have a boy and a girl just because we're not sure if we can go through this again. [LAUGH]
R:  Again.  Exactly.  
L:  At times it really --
R:  Oh wouldn't that be wonderful?
L:  -- you know.
R:  Yeah, I always wanted to do that.  Have a boy and a girl --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know?  [NOISE] It didn't work out for me --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but wow.  That is so wonderful.  Wow.
L:  We are excited.
R:  Yeah.  Any names? [NOISE] 
L:  Um, we like Holly and Caitlin for girls --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, I like that too.
L:  -- and Logan and Christopher for boys.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, I like that too.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Oh boy.
L:  Everyone's like, "How did you decide so fast?" --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- and I'm like, "I don't know.  We just like them so that's that".
R:  Yeah, but you know how you -- I -- to me I always have a name.  I had a name since I was like seventeen.
L:  Did you?  [LAUGH] 
R:  I said, "This is -- I know what the name's gonna be" --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and I, you know --
