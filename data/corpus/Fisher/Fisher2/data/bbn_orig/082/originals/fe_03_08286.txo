L:  Hello.
R:  Hello. [LAUGH] 
L:  Hi. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] I'm Maria.
R:  I'm Loretta, this is funny. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, it's very strange, and this is my first one.
R:  Mine, too.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, okay. [LAUGH] 
R:  Interesting.
L:  [SIGH] Yes. [SIGH] 
R:  [SIGH] So, our topic is censorship and do we think --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- public and private schools should be able to dictate what [MN] books kids are allowed to read?
L:  Yeah, I think that's what it said, it was --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- real m- garbled.
R:  Interesting.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Well, let me see.
L:  Mm. [NOISE] 
R:  I personally do not believe that the, um, [SIGH] school system should be able to, um, [NOISE] just [SIGH] -- unilaterally just, uh, decide whether or not [SIGH] a book is okay or not for their students to read.  I think it's something that the parents should be involved with --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- because, um, there are some books that, um, I probably would deem okay for my child to read --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that maybe another mother or father may not, but, um, I don't know, I d- I -- [SIGH] I think that that's all part of education.  You have to expose everybody to just about e- everything --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- and anything that's out there.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  Just so --
L:  I would -- I would agree.  I kinda -- [SIGH] like, I would say it all depends a lot on the age of the student.
R:  Right.
L:  'Cause in -- in grammar school especially, you know, you don't -- [MN] you know, there are some people who think their children are ready for things before other people -- you -- before my -- I might think my child is ready to [SIGH] be engrossed in such things and -- but then h- once you get into high school, especially the upper grades, I mean, you're -- the kids should be, um, [MN] old enough to be able to read something objectively.
R:  Correct, um --
L:  You know.
R:  -- I know there -- there are some books that my husband has -- has read, and I'm like, "What are you talking about?"  I've never --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- heard of this book, you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so I'm like -- and -- and then it may be one of the books that's like on the list of -- [SIGH] of books that our, um, public schools might want to censor [SIGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because, um, around here -- I'm -- I'm in Detroit.
L:  Okay.
R:  [SIGH] And there was some hubbub about Harry Potter.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, uh, which is so funny to me.  I'm in New York -- um, [LIPSMACK] in New York City and, uh, but we didn't get a lot of that in the immediate area here.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But on the outlying -- like, I -- I heard a lot about upstate New York and things where [SIGH] people were -- you know, "Oh, it promotes witchcraft". And I'm like, "It's just a fantasy story, people". [SIGH] 
R:  Um, I'm like --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- what's, um, X Men, you know? What's --
L:  [MN] Exactly.
R:  -- what's Doctor Hook?
L:  Exactly.
R:  [SIGH] It -- it's -- it's all just -- you know, it's -- it's just now when -- [SIGH] [MN] [SIGH] I do have some -- some friends who have concerns about, you know, the witchcraft issue --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of Harry Potter [LAUGH] because of religious reasons.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, other than that -- but, you know, I'm -- I'm like, "It's fiction". [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, it's -- it's not promoting a way of like, it's not telling children to go out and find a broomstick and fly on it, it's just -- [SIGH] it's a story.
R:  Yeah, it's -- it's a story and, um, [SIGH] like I said earlier, I think, um, censorship is just -- it's not good because w- once -- I personally feel once the government tries to censor one thing, it just opens the door for them to just get --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- right on in [SIGH] and just start [LAUGH] inching and inching and inching [SIGH] all the --
L:  I agree.
R:  -- all of our rights completely down, so --
L:  I agree, I agree.
R:  -- [SIGH] even if I didn't agree with a particular book that --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- my -- that my kids' school might want them to read and maybe I wasn't so, um, into that particular book, [SIGH] I think I would maybe read the book myself first --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, do my own little education for --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- for -- for my perspective to my children --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] because teachers have a totally different perspective. [NOISE] Do you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah, I do, I think that's [SIGH] the important part about, you know, either public [NOISE] or private s- I mean, I understand private schools will [SIGH] censor what's being read because they're private schools and they reserve that right, especially if it's attached -- [SIGH] you know, if it's a Catholic school or a Protestant school or something --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they're only going to -- they're not going to most likely approve of a book that's going to teach against their [SIGH] --
R:  Religious beliefs.
L:  -- their principles, yeah.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] But I -- the -- I think the important part, and the reason that censorship probably isn't necessary, is if the parents -- if parents do what they should do as parents and -- and have an open dialogue with their children [SIGH] about anything they read in school, [SIGH] are able to, you know, keep [NOISE] that discussion opened and th- no that it just -- they read it in school, wrote a book report and that's the end.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That -- that n- I think that negates a lot of the need for censorship unless something is compl- obscene, you know, like [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a sexually overt or [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah, but --
L:  -- something like that.
R:  -- nowadays they even have cartoons that -- that are based on strippers. [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, I saw that --
R:  I haven't --
L:  -- commercial.
R:  I'm like --
L:  [SIGH] I was like, "Are you kidding me?"
R:  Yeah, I'm like, "What happened to Fred Flintstone?"  You know what I mean?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm like, "Come on, now".  There's --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- there -- there are other areas that [SIGH] -- that I would like to see, you know, some -- some sort of restrictions [NOISE] being --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah. [MN] 
R:  -- set, but then again, you know, I -- it -- it all falls on -- on parents.  You know, if you don't want your kids to watch certain cartoons then you just go ahead and [SIGH] and get your [inaudible] or whatever and just restrict the amount that they watch it and all that. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Because once you start censoring [NOISE] it's just bad.  Nothing good can come from telling someone that, you know -- uh, I mean, it's -- [SIGH] it's just like when -- when -- when you're a parent and your -- your daughter wants to go out with that tattooed, ear pierced --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know, person --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- that -- that you're just, you know, not liking at all --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's just going to make that person --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- just want to go that -- that much more.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  So, I'm just like -- I'm like, "Censorship?  Y- no". [SIGH] I just don't think it's good.  I just don't think it's good at all, because [NOISE] my two boys are [NOISE] almost three -- well, one is almost three and one is fifteen months [SIGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I want them to read [NOISE] just about anything that they want to get their hands on --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- as long as I know what it is they're reading because, you know, kids', um, minds aren't exposed to as much as -- as ours, as we are [NOISE] of course --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- older than them. [SIGH] [NOISE] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And we have to make sure that -- that they don't misinterpret. [NOISE] 
L:  Sure, yeah, exactl- [MN] exactly, and the point of censorship -- [SIGH] censorship, um, destroys [MN] the teaching of, uh, um -- destroys people's abilities to learn to judge for themselves, to read --
R:  Right.
L:  -- something objectively and -- and form an opinion [SIGH] without taking it for absolute truth, you know.
R:  Yeah, um, and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um, [NOISE] um, some of the kids today have just [NOISE] -- I don't know, it -- it's just weird 'cause it -- it seems like everything ties in to everything.  If [SIGH] -- [NOISE] if you censor things [NOISE] then you could just, um, shut off someone's creativity, you know what I mean, because maybe they don't want to write within the constraints of whatever you deem is okay. [NOISE] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then you would never know, [SIGH] um, how profound that person's works could have really been [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just because your mind was a little bit more closed [NOISE] and [NOISE] [SIGH] you stand there being censor, "No, we don't like what you're talking about, we're going to, [NOISE] you know, say that [SIGH] we don't want your book in our school" and you know, it's -- [SIGH] I don't know, it's -- once [SIGH] I d- I don't honestly believe that there is a, um -- that there --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- is a fair, um, [NOISE] formula [NOISE] for saying what -- what should be censored and what shouldn't be censored, like, across the board.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because what I find offensive is something totally different than what someone else probably would find offensive.
L:  Yes.
R:  [SIGH] But, like you said, you know, earlier, it -- it depends on, you know, your -- your kids' age group [SIGH] and all that other stuff, but, mm, mm, [NOISE] I don't know. [SIGH] I don't know. [SIGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I just --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- don't know and it -- it's funny because I never really thought about censorship, but then you have kids.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, yeah.
R:  And then the whole paradigm shifts.
L:  Yeah, you have to become very aware of what --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what they're being --
R:  Your whole perspective.
L:  -- -- exposed to.
R:  Yeah, 'cause I'm like, "go to school please, I don't have kids".  And now that I have kids, and I'm like --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- "Whoa, whoa, hold up".
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay, so -- [SIGH] so this area is good for this but not good for this and [NOISE] this charter school is good for over here and [SIGH] --
L:  Oh, jeeze.
R:  -- oh, man, it's just like, "Ooh". [LIPSMACK] it's just --
L:  A lot --
R:  -- so much information to [NOISE] [SIGH] -- to have to sort through. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah, I'm --
R:  I mean, it's tough enough being a parent, but, ooh, if you're a working parent too, [MN] [LIPSMACK] I don't even s-
L:  Then --
R:  -- I don't even see how, mm, mm. [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, it's very -- very difficult.  I can imagine.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Don't know from first hand experience, but --
R:  No.
L:  -- I can only imagine.
R:  I am a happy stay at home mum.  Worked --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- with the first child, but the second one, we were just like, "You know what?  We're just going to stay home". [SIGH] 
L:  Mm.
R:  And it's just, like, you know, uh, [MN] this requires [NOISE] all of the attention --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that you have.
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] 
R:  Because right about now, look, [MN] I'm -- I'm reading, like, W- Where the Wild Things Are.  I'm reading it first, you know, [MN] [SIGH] this is one of those books that my husband read and I had never heard of. [SIGH] 
L:  Okay.
R:  So, here I am reading Where the Wild Things Are.  I'm trying to make sure that the content and the pictures aren't too much --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for my two year old [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because I don't want him to be freaked out, having nightmares.
L:  Yeah, sure, sure.
R:  [SIGH] So, I'm doing my own personal censorship [NOISE] in this household, because I'm like, "You know what?  Mm, [SIGH] maybe he's not quite ready for -- for this".  Or maybe I can read it to him, but I can't read it to Ben [SIGH] --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- since Ben's going look at the scary pictures and be like, "Momma, what's that?"
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, he's going to be --
L:  [MN] Screaming in the middle of the night --
R:  Yeah, you know?
L:  -- "Momma, it's coming for me". [LAUGH] Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, he's going to running in his bed --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and I'm going to like, "What's going on, is he having a nightmare?" [SIGH] And like, "Yeah".  So, mm --
L:  [SIGH] But that -- um, but that's something that you -- I mean, I think that's different from a -- [MN] a parent censoring for their child [MN] --
