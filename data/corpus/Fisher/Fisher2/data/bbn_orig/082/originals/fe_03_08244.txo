R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, my name's CJ.
R:  Hi, I'm Nick.
L:  Hi, Nick, how're you doing?
R:  Pretty good.  Pretty good.
L:  Is this your first one of these?
R:  Yeah.  This is my first one.
L:  Mine too.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, so the topic is --
R:  The censorship --
L:  -- uh --
R:  -- and, uh --
L:  -- censorship in the schools.
R:  Right.  Well, I -- I don't know, I don't -- I don't think they have the right to, uh, to ban certain books.  I mean, books are written to be read.  What do you think?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, I think it might depend on the age of the student too.  I mean --
R:  [MN] Oh.
L:  -- if you're in --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- college or in high school, I think you're old enough to kinda have -- be able to -- to read something and -- and get the gist of what it means.
R:  Right.
L:  But when they're younger, it's kinda just, like, you know, letting young school age kids on the computer.  They do it without parents looking over their shoulder.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE] 
L:  So, I think part of it is -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- is based on age.
R:  Yeah.  That -- that's true.  That's a good point  Uh, but I think , like, most , like, generally, like, a younger crowd wouldn't want to read the type of books [NOISE] that , uh, schools would probably view as censorship, um, unless it's one of those, you know, crazy, like -- like people just are against the book, like, Hey Father, for instance.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  You know, a lot of, uh, you know, religious, um, like, the church and stuff; they're against Harry Potter.  But, uh, I don't know, I mean, it's -- that's a another thing ; it's up to the parents also whether they want their chil- child to read certain books or not.  So, if -- if it comes down to it and the school really bans a book and the child just really wants to read it and the parents think it -- it's fine, [NOISE] they should be allowed I think.
L:  Yeah.  I under- understand that, especially with Harry Potter --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- everybody saying, "Oh, it's about witchcraft and wizardry and things like that".  Shouldn't be about -- but it's also a way that a lot of kids now are really, really wanting to read.
R:  Right.
L:  And I think that's a good thing.  That -- if they censor that book, and don't allow it into the schools, and yet it's a motivating factor for kids to --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- start to read --
R:  If --
L:  -- why --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- would you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- hold -- hold that back?
R:  Uh, yeah.  That's -- that's -- that's such a good point.  I mean, it's a -- it's not a kiddy book.  It's a large book, you know.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  The word --
L:  Nine hundred pages.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- [NOISE] huh, excuse me?
L:  The -- the last one she put out, book five --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- is, like, almost nine hundred pages.
R:  I know, I read it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I read it myself.  Did you read it?
L:  No.  I haven't read it yet.
R:  Oh.
L:  I need to start with the first book.
R:  Oh, yeah --
L:  But --
R:  -- oh man, I've read all of them.  [NOISE] But, yeah, like, it just depends.  If it's -- if there -- there are some books as y- -- they are just really adult.  Even books I've read in high school.  Um, I remember reading Catch Twenty Two.  And it was just such a dark --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- book, you know.  But it was one of my favorite books.  And I'm -- I'm glad I read it.  You know, it's just -- it just all depends.  [NOISE]
L:  And -- and I think also when it comes to the censorship is, whose -- who, like, you --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- were talking about the parents having the right to say nay or yay.  I mean, who on the, um, board of education has the right to say, "Well, I don't think, uh, you know, each kid should be able to read that book in our library".  
R:  Right.
L:  Because, whereas some kids aren't mature enough to read it, other kids might be mature enough to read it and really get the gist of it.
R:  Right.
L:  Or maybe they read a book and they're really turned on by it, and then they turn another kid on to it and it kinda has that snowball effect.  Kinda like Harry Potter does, like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the more people hear --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- about it, the more, different people wanted to read it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it -- and if your goal, especially in school, is to have kids l- learn to read and develop those skills and develop those critical thinking skills; if you ban books that one person says, "These are not good", then i- it just doesn't make any sense.
R:  Right.  Like, how -- 
L:  You know, it -- it --
R:  -- how do you, like, gain that, you know, authority to be able to tell someone they can't read this?  Or can't read that?
L:  Yeah.  Uh, because it's personal opinion.
R:  Right.
L:  It's all personal opinion.
R:  It's all about that.  [NOISE] Uh, It's a tough -- it's a tough -- it's a tough thing to think about 'cause then you could turn around and say the parent doesn't want [NOISE] them to read that book, you know.  [NOISE] So, it's, you know, it's kind of, like, it's just the same thing with prayer in schools.
L:  Right.
R:  So, yeah.  I- It's one of those deals.  But books I think for the most part are, you know, pretty -- [NOISE] pretty fine.  Uh -- uh, they -- they just give, like, you know, develop your mind basically.  I read a lot of books when I was a kid.  And I remember I read, like -- like huge, like, Dickens books when I was a kid, you know.  [NOISE] And they're pretty dark, like, you know, totalitarianism and that.
L:  Right.
R:  It -- they really just some, um, big issues, especially there in the Victorian age.  And I -- when I was a kid I didn't totally get it but it's good for later on in life too; that's another thing.
L:  Yeah, it develops, um, [LIPSMACK] how would you put it?  Kinda like values and views --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that maybe you would normally not have developed if you hadn't read that sort of book.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Uh, I think it --
R:  Yeah.  That's right.
L:  Yeah.  It makes you, um, [LIPSMACK] depending on the book, uh -- uh, which book we're talking about, but I -- I think it allows you to develop that thought process.
R:  Yeah.
L:  To really look at something and say [LIPSMACK] I remember reading about this.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And this --
R:  And, like, the --
L:  -- reminds me.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE] It -- yeah.  Your brain definitely develops.  It's like a muscle, you know.  Like you're in a -- and a local side comes out.  Your -- everything comes out.  Like, it's -- it's just a great skill.  Just like preparing you for the future.  So, [LIPSMACK] that's another good thing.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [several inaudible words] [LAUGH] Now if you could only --
R:  [NOISE],
L:  -- ad- -- and I think when it comes to, um, people [inaudible] putting a --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- a censorship on certain books, how we were talking about parents, have a -- that that right, more so than say a board of education.  But let's say a board of education in California; 'cause that's where I'm at -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- might be a lot more liberal than a board of education in South Carolina.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And where they say, "Oh no, that's a terrible book" --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- like, some of those people in the south are the ones saying, "No, no, Harry Potter, bad stuff".
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, it's regional as well.  Oops, I'm going to have to move.
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, 
R:  Oh, no.
L:  [LIPSMACK] So, it -- it is.  It's very regional as to where [NOISE] you get that censorship or where you don't get that censorship.  
R:  Uh-huh.  It --
L:  How --
R:  -- yeah --
L:  -- mm, how can I say it?  Liberal.  [LAUGH] How liberal an area might be.
R:  Yeah.  It does make a difference.  I remember, um, like, during, like, the Civil War, like, Harriet Beecher Stowe's, novel Uncle To- -- Uncle Tom's Cabin was -- was really --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- banned in, uh, you know, the south.  Do you remember that?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  It was --
L:  And --
R:  -- it was, like, super banned in the south.  And in the north it was, like, the best seller.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Yeah --
R:  So --
L:  -- so it is.  It's -- it can be real regional as well.
R:  Yeah.  Well, hopefully in today's changing world, um, [NOISE] I mean, people just take things for what they are.  Like, if a book, um, like, people just debate the book instead of, like, censor it.  You know what I mean?
L:  Right.  And the funny thing is I think a lot of people who say, "No, that's a bad book", maybe haven't even read the book.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, how do they know?  Have they read part of it?  Or someone said, "Oh, did you read page four hundred and ninety three --"
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  "-- and did you hear -- see that language in there?"  And --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so they'll turn to page four hundred and ninety three, read it and say, "Oh, yes, this is a bad book".
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But it's taken out of context.
R:  [NOISE] Right.  Right.  But half of them, I mean, well the thing with, like, Harry Potter, like, my grandma hasn't even read it, but she's, like, a -- she used to be a pastor; so she just listens  --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- to -- she just listens to what the church says.  But she's -- she's really, like, wh- [MN] le- -- reasonable, you know.  [NOISE] So, like, I tell her; I'm like, "Grandma, why don't you just pick it up and, like, read it a little".  'Cause it's -- I'd say it's not mostly about witchcraft and stuff.  It's just more about a boy's life.  And, like, the witchcraft and stuff, like, makes it, like, the -- the magic as I say, makes it more fun to read.  You know what I mean?
L:  Right.
R:  So, that's -- that's my take on the whole thing.  It's just -- it's just a really cool book.  That's all I think it is.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And I'm in college.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, [MN] like, I said, when it comes to censorship, I -- I'm pretty sure there are a whole lot of people that would just listen to what someone else says, and then say, "Oh no, it's a bad book".  And if you ask them, "Did you read it?"  They'll [LAUGH] -- if they're honest, they'll say, "No".
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.
L:  And how can you make that judgment?  How can you make that judgment whether or not it's something that should or shouldn't be censored if you're not willing to -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- to read it?
R:  Yeah.  That's fair. 
L:  And in it's perspective too.  Because like you -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- we were saying, depending where you live, you can read something and say, "Oh, that's, you know --" 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  "-- anti moral".  And yet somewhere else where they're more liberal, they'll say, "No, that's -- that's a great book --" 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  "-- That's part of life.  That's how you live life".
R:  Yeah.  Plus you could learn a lot from things that you read that you even don't disag- -- you know, don't agree with.
L:  Right.
R:  Because, yeah.  So I mean, [LIPSMACK] like, you could take a lot from anything.  Um, like, if you had, like, the -- the manifest or something, you know, Marxist --
L:  Oh, right.
R:  -- manifest there or something like that, you know.  Um, like, half the world agrees with it, half the world doesn't.  But you could still, like, you could still figure it -- you could read into that person's thought process and it could even further your thought processes.  Do that --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- yeah.  Through even something you don't agree with.  You [NOISE] could, like, come out stronger from it.
L:  Yeah.  It's like you appreciate --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- what -- what they've written.  It doesn't mean you have to agree with it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But you realize that depending on where you grow up, your views are going to be different than someone else who grew up in a different area.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And --
