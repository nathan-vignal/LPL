L:  [LIPSMACK] Hi, I'm Roberta.
R:  [SIGH] HI, I'm Betty.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, we're supposed to discuss about public and private schools.
R:  Right, and censorship, or, um, whether students should -- could --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- should be [SIGH] uh, not permitted --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- to read certain books or whatever. [SIGH] Um, I don't know what your history of work is, but mine i- I worked in a [SIGH] school, uh, library. [LAUGH] And so --
L:  [NOISE]  
R:  -- that sort of fits in here, um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] uh, I --
L:  Well, I --
R:  -- I worked with young kids so, it -- it -- [SIGH] it doesn't fit in always, but it is somewhat related. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right, right. [SIGH] Oh, I work for a newspaper. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] okay. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] That's, uh, an interesting, uh, [LAUGH] topic there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Mhm. [SIGH] 
L:  And do you feel that, um, [LIPSMACK] uh, certain books should [NOISE] be restricted --
R:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] 
L:  -- or ?
R:  Well, um, when I worked at a school where there were kids up to sixth graders, [SIGH] um, [LIPSMACK] we had a lot of controversy about, uh, some of the books that were [LAUGH] -- uh, oh, this was probably ten years ago --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- books that at that time were -- were just controversial because they -- they [SIGH] -- some people thought they said too much or [SIGH] gave the kids ideas by being so, [SIGH] um, [LIPSMACK] uh, [MN] what do I -- [SIGH] like, graphic and that type of thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so, um, [LIPSMACK] uh, we discussed it a lot and of course [MN] it was difficult to come to any real consensus about it.  Some people think it's good, and -- [SIGH] and to be so totally open and say [MN] -- allow kids to read anything. [SIGH] Frankly, I think there are some things that, [SIGH] depending upon the age of course --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- [SIGH] but in grade school, I think that there should be restrictions. [SIGH]  
L:  [NOISE] Oh, I -- I feel, um, as far as, you know, books should be age appropriate.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, if there's -- if it's of a scientific nature where they do have to, [SIGH] um, give descriptions --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of certain, [MN] say, bodily or anything --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, you know, of --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the human body, [SIGH] then, um, depending on the age of the child, if it pertains to, [SIGH] um, their subject, etcetera, [SIGH] um, I think it would be appropriate.  I don't think -- [SIGH] and certain stories, too, that, um, [SIGH] I don't know, sometimes people, like, reinterpret things [SIGH] to mean something else than --
R:  Mm. [SIGH] 
L:  -- what they actually do.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] Um, even in today, [NOISE] they, um [SIGH] -- I know even, like, from the paper and such, people read into some of the articles what isn't even there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it depends on their own, [SIGH] um, likes, dislikes, um, their own prejudices --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- etcetera.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  So, um, [SIGH] I don't know, I think, um, they -- some -- the basic books and it's -- everything, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I don't think there should be that much censorship in it.
R:  No, [SIGH] no, well, um, certainly, uh, o- our constitution allows for [SIGH] freedom of speech and [SIGH] -- and so, um, we need to always [SIGH] live by that, but of course the supreme court sometimes, uh, [SIGH] decides that [SIGH] there's too much freedom or -- [SIGH] or [LAUGH] not enough or whatever [COUGH] which, um, [LIPSMACK] does sometimes alter some of our [SIGH] -- our experience in that line, but, [SIGH] um, basically, I -- I --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- think that --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- people should be --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- should have access, especially, like, in a public library, they should have access to --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] anything that has been published and then they need to make their own, [MN] uh, decisions and -- and interpret things in their own way and, [NOISE] I mean, it sh- it should be available at least, is what I think. [NOISE] 
L:  Yes, yes. 
R:  Mm.
L:  No, I -- I agree because --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, if you -- if it's a subject that you don't like, or don't --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- want to read about --
R:  Nope.
L:  -- don't read it.
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  If it's something you are interested in or would like to know more about [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- by all means read it.
R:  Yeah. [SIGH] so I guess --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- censorship is --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- for you to operate with yourself, uh --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you -- you censor.  If you are open to anything, that -- that's fine, as long as that doesn't --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- hurt me or -- or anyone else --
L:  Right.
R:  -- then, uh, yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  And as far as books for children, I mean, children are children, you --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- have books that are age appropriate [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that, uh --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [NOISE] they can learn things from and even --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- get an open mindedness about certain things.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, of course, there are books with just stories, you know, fiction, that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- could be [SIGH] a little too graphic or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- such. [SIGH] Um, I don't think they should be available in the schools.  If their parents --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- would allow them to read them then -- in a library, that's, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- up to them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but in the schools it should be basically good literature. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LIPSMACK] Right, yeah.
L:  [SIGH] Uh, and not --
R:  [SIGH] And of course any time a b- a book is banned or, uh, [SIGH] restricted, that is what everybody wants. [LAUGH] I remember it was [SIGH] a few years ago, there was a book, I can't think of the name of it right now, but it was, uh, [SIGH] probably a young-- young, uh, preteen [SIGH] [MN] -- written for that age and, [NOISE] uh, uh, s- some of the teachers in the system decided that it should not be [SIGH] available, they should keep it behind the desk and only allow it to be [SIGH] put out if the parents sent a letter saying it was okay with them or whatever.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Well, of course every kid in the school, once they got wind of that--
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- wanted that book.
L:  Right.
R:  So [SIGH] --
L:  Because it peaks --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- their curiosity. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Right. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And if it's something they shouldn't have, that's exactly what they want to have, so --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- [SIGH] Yeah. [MN] 
L:  Wasn't it a while ago that [LIPSMACK] some group, I forgot what state or something --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] they banned Catcher in the Rye, or something like --
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah, that was, um, that was one.  Even for, [SIGH] I think, high school --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
R:  -- it was [MN] --
L:  They just banned it --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- period from --
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  -- everybody.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] And they were burning it, they had a big book --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- burning or something.
R:  Sure.
L:  [SIGH] [MN] I just --
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  -- vaguely remember that.
R:  Yeah. [SIGH] There have -- there have been, uh, [MN] some classics, total classics, that, uh -- [SIGH] that have been restricted to, [MN] uh --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- high schools. I don't know about college, but, uh --
L:  Right.  See, something like that I don't understand.  I mean --
R:  No.
L:  -- [NOISE] that just doesn't make any sense. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah. [SIGH] Well, uh, a -- a--
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- little bit of knowledge, uh, is a dangerous thing, somebody said [LAUGH] and -- and, um, so I guess that -- that's --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- true in -- in most cases, uh --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- uh, if you o- only know a little bit about something then you're likely to [NOISE] -- [SIGH] to, uh, not fully understand it, and understanding is one of the things that makes [SIGH] problems for people all over the world, and especially these days. [SIGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  We need to -- [MN] to understand, uh, other cultures, other [SIGH] perspectives in order to, uh --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- l- learn how to get along with each other. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  So, mhm.
L:  Right, well, if you don't understand, that's how you make mistakes and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, judge people or situations wrong --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because you don't know the full facts.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And, um, [SIGH] yeah, a little knowledge is a dangerous thing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a lot of knowledge can be a good thing. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes, yes, of course.  The more -- [SIGH] the more you know [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- in -- in so many cases, the more you're able to understand [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- what another w- what, uh, another person is [LAUGH] living by, or -- or their experience.
L:  Right.
R:  So --
L:  Right.
R:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  But, uh, um [COUGH] [SIGH] --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- is this your first time?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yes, [LAUGH] it is.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Is it yours?
L:  Yes. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Okay, I just -- I think it was yesterday that I got signed up, so  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, my god, so did I.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yes.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Uh, where -- where do you live?
L:  [SIGH] I'm in New York.
R:  Oh, okay, and I'm in Wisconsin. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
R:  Ah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] That is so strange.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  And how are the schools and their philosophies over there?
R:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] Um, well, you know, Midwestern, uh, pretty [NOISE] conservative and, um, [SIGH] I live in a small town and, [SIGH] uh, so there -- through the years there have been times when, um, people would rise up and -- [SIGH] and, uh, [LAUGH] want a -- [SIGH] a book to be banned or taken off the shelves or restricted --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- use, or [SIGH] -- or even -- we -- we have a lot of, um, home schoolers in this area.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Lots of them --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] and it's mainly because they don't think --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the schools are [SIGH] performing [LAUGH] the way they --
