R:  Hi, I'm Ann McMillan. [PAUSE]
L:  Hi, I'm Heather Higginbotham. [PAUSE]
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.  Are -- are we supposed to chit chat how ?
L:  Yeah.  I -- I missed the topic [LAUGH].
R:  It was censorship and she asked if um [LIPSMACK] if -- what your opinion is on if they should -- if a private or public -- private school would allo- should allow -- be able to choose what they can and can't read.  I think that was what it was.
L:  Read?
R:  Yeah, read.
L:  Oh.  Well, that's different to what I thought it might be.  I thought it might be something about online.
R:  Well, this is my first time doing this and I --
L:  Me too [LAUGH].
R:  -- I had just read about it on my -- do you belong to Winners?
L:  Huh-uh.
R:  No?  Okay.  Well, I belong to a group on the Internet and they were talking about it --
L:  You know, I f- I can't remember how I found it [LAUGH].  But this is my first time, too. [LAUGH]
R:  So, I hope -- I don't know what we're supposed to do, probably just give our opinion --
L:  Yeah, that's a -- what I think we're supposed to do, is just talk about our opinions on it.  I think um when it comes to books, I don't know, I'm kind of torn on the issue I guess, actually [LAUGH] --
R:  I think that --
L:  I think some books that are like classics, if they're -- if they're taught with the reading, not has hand the book and tell them to read it --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- if it's taught along with it, then I think it's fine.  But I know in some schools, like my school sometimes they just hand you a book and expect you to read it all and then you discuss it afterwards.
R:  [MN]
L:  I think if it's a highly like criticized book or people are opposed to it, you should discuss it through out read it together, I mean --
R:  Right.  I -- I -- I think the censorship isn't always bad, especially um I think grade level censorship is good, you know, because sometimes kids --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- go and pick up books that they shouldn't be reading --
L:  I agree with that too.  Like, in the library --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I think the library should have a little bit more censorship to it, what they can just go in and pick up and read --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like classroom, that's different, but I agree, like the library, if they're just going to walk in there and pick up a book [LAUGH] that'd be different and the different grade levels.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Like in our school they have like kindergarten through sixth grade in the same school --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.  Do you w- --
L:  -- so that's a wide range.
R:  -- you work in a school?
L:  No, but it's the -- just --
R:  You go to --
L:  -- just the school where I used to go [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Can you come --
L:  Um, they have --
R:  [several inaudible words] --
L:  -- and then they have like seventh through twelfth grade together.  They just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- changed it all and did all that.  So, there's like a wide range of age groups there.
R:  I went to a school like that, too.
L:  So, that -- that would be even more complex to --
R:  Censors- ship; is a touchy subject anyway.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because you usually have a passionate person [NOISE] on both sides of the issue and then you [NOISE] you have some people that are liberal minded and they think that people should be e- exposed to things and then you have the ones that want to protect their children and don't w- you know, they would rather introduce things like that to their kids or --
L:  Yeah, make sure they're in a controlled environment --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- rather than just on their own.
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] 
L:  I know, that's -- it's a very touchy subject --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- especially -- I thought it would be -- I thought we were going to talk about online censorship.  Because I know that's been a big --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like at the library thing that they just passed.
R:  Right.  Hold on a second.
L:  Okay.
R:  Can you guys please go out?  I'm on a -- a business phone call.  Okay, but there's another bathroom [NOISE].  Okay.  There's another bathroom. [NOISE] Yeah.  Thank you.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  They all want to come in when I'm on the phone.
L:  I know, that's what I -- that's the problem I had --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that's why I didn't hear the topic [LAUGH] because everybody wanted to talk to me right when the phone -- when I was trying to listen.
R:  So, they said, I guess it's a ten minute conversation --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that after ten minutes then --
L:  Then I'm not sure what happens [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  Me either.
L:  Because I've never done it.  I know that -- I know that the study is to figure out um, how conversations flow, which I guess ours kind of, you know, got off topic there into the -- talking about library and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- online and [LAUGH] covered a lot of topics.  It's hard to talk about something for a long time.  I've -- I've received a few calls and some of the other topics I was like, "I don't know anything about that, I can't talk about it for ten minutes" but this one, I don't know, s- censorship, a lot like in music, is what I've heard a lot about too.  Books aren't really that big a thing around here because they -- they read um -- some of the books that have been on the list of people that want to get rid of them --
R:  I think it's been a long time since they've censored any books.  I mean, as -- you don't really hear about it.
L:  I think there was a -- I think it went to some [inaudible] or something and they decided that it -- it needed to be done in individual schools o something, but I live in a small town and it really hasn't been that big of a deal to anybody here.
R:  Where do you live at?
L:  I live in Mount Gilliard, Ohio.
R:  Oh.  You're -- I'm in North Carolina.
L:  Oh [LAUGH].
R:  And it's a small town too, it's like twenty five hundred people.
L:  Oh, my gosh.  Everybody -- everybody from around here is going to North Carolina for vacation.  I've known like five people now that are going to North Carolina for vacation.  That's funny.  [LAUGH]
R:  It's -- it's a pretty State.
L:  I'm like, wow, maybe I should go to North Carolina. [inaudible]
R:  We went to Myrtle Beach over fourth of July weekend --
L:  Oh, that'd be nice.
R:  -- so --
L:  I mean, Ohio, there's no beaches.
R:  Well, and that's South Carolina, but it's, you know, still the Carolinas.
L:  Still close, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] So, anyway [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] our -- censorship.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Hm.
L:  I know one book when I was in school that well kind of caused a little stir was of Mice and Men --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just because there was cussing in it.
R:  Right.
L:  Because some of the kids had problems with that.  It wasn't the parents, it was the kids in my class, they were like, you know, "I don't think that we should be exposed to this language" and --
R:  Well, and then there's the Judy Bloom books and --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- stuff like that.
L:  I ah yeah, which one was that, do you know?  That they were --
R:  Um [SIGH] there's been a few her -- she's always been a little bit on the racy side anyway.
L:  I have one of -- I have one of hers.
R:  I -- I either got it --
L:  But I --
R:  [several inaudible words] 
L:  -- yeah, that's the one I have and I really liked that book.
R:  I did too, so that's why I --
L:  I mean --
R:  -- that's why I think --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- it's not always a bad --
L:  I thought it was a really good book --
R:  -- it's not always a good thing to [NOISE] be overly censored.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, because I said, you know, "When my daughter gets old enough, I think she should read that" because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that really helped me when I was that age and going through all that stuff that Margaret did in that book.
R:  [inaudible] come and get a drink.
L:  It was a really helpful book.
R:  [NOISE] That's it -- that's just --
L:  I mean --
R:  -- [NOISE] 
L:  I mean, when you're that age, sometimes you don't really feel comfortable talking about that stuff to like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- your parents, or even your friends.  It's just kind of like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you might be a little embarrassed, so I thought --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I -- I just loved that book, I thought it was a great book and --
R:  I used to like it too.
L:  Of Mice and Men, I didn't really have a problem with it.  I read it --
R:  Mhm.
L:   -- like the beginning of it, but then I told her, I said, "I can't read this because I just don't like it" [LAUGH] and she d- she didn't make me read it, so I didn't really get in on the whole --
R:  I saw the movie, so I don't [NOISE] I --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- never read the book.
L:  I didn't s- I -- I tried to read the book, like I said, but I just couldn't read it.  I -- it just was boring.  It was like, I can't read this book.  And I told my teacher and she's like, "Okay, well" so, I read Raisin in the Sun, I think --
R:  Oh, that was a good one.
L:  -- it is a play.  Yeah.  So, it was a good one.  And -- but that's the good thing at my school, though, if you -- if you opposed -- if you don't feel comfortable reading a book, or -- well, my old school, I -- I've been out of school for like six years and I still [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- call it my school.  Um --
R:  You relate to your school?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um and -- and my school and you don't -- if you don't want to read a book, or your parents are opposed to a book, they don't make a big deal out of it, they just give you an alternate project to do.
R:  I think that's great --
L:  And --
R:  -- I think that's a good idea.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, ah -- it's always worked out fun, there's -- there's never been a big issue of it in our soc- in our community or anything --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and we've never had any problems and I think that's why --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- because they --
R:  Communicated about it, basically.
L:  Yeah.  They made a plan and they stuck to it and it's worked out perfect.  I know the um internet has been a problem --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the censorship on there.
R:  Right.
L:  Because they've had -- because -- part of the problem with the censorship thing online is like um White House, the White House um website --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they can't go to that because White House dotcom is a porn site.
R:  Oh, is it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, I didn't know that.
L:  And so -- which they found that out because they were researching on the White House and they had to take the -- the censorship thingies off of there, the censorship program off of there --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so they could got to White House dot gov --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and some of the kids accidentally put in White House dotcom because they weren't paying attention --
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  -- and they found out and -- so basically they kind of leave it up to the -- the monitor there in the room --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to make sure they're not going on those sites and I don't think that's really the best --
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  -- because they're not going to pay attention the whole time, I know how that's --
R:  I could see the problem there.
L:  I know how those teachers are [LAUGH].
R:  And then the word would spread.
L:  Yeah.
R:  To go to White House dotcom, not gov --
L:  Yeah.  And I think that -- I know it just passed in the library they're supposed to be locking that and it's kind of hard because then some of the educational sites you can't go to, like health sites, I know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think if they say, like, breast or anything like that, y- you can't go on it.
R:  No, that's kinda --
L:  Because it's censored.
R:  -- crazy too.
L:  I mean, it's like overly censored and it's -- and I -- I just think cens- I don't know, I think censorship is on an individual basis and should be handled by individuals and --
R:  Can't like blanket co- --
L:  -- personally.
R:   -- give a blanket coverage of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- each thing.
L:  It's not everything.  I mean, it's like anything, not -- not one rule applies to everybody.  There's always an exception to every rule.  So, I mean, you can't say -- I mean, for our third grader, reading a certain book might be awful, but for a twelfth grader it could be just fine.  It could really spark a good discussion and really help them learn something.  So --
R:  I agree.  And I think
