L:  My name is Philip.
R:  Yeah, hey, Philip, it's Ron.  How're you doing?
L:  Okay.  Hello?
R:  Yeah, hi man.
L:  [MN] 
R:  These things are all --
L:  Oh, man.
R:  I know, these things are always crazy, aren't they?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Censorship, man.  
R:  What part of the --
L:  Wow.
R:  What part of the country are you in?
L:  I'm, um, in South Carolina.
R:  Oh, that's cool.  I'm in California.
L:  Oh, man.  That's the longest -- man, I hadn't talked to any- anyone in California yet.  I've been doing this --
R:  Haven't --
L:  -- for a while but --
R:  What part of South Carolina?
L:  Um, North Augusta.
R:  Oh, North Augusta.  Oh, man.  That's amazing.  Actually, I kinda -- I know that area a little bit.  I --
L:  No.
R:  I was in Augusta, um, New Years.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah, actually I was in the, uh, medical college at Georgia Hospital for like a couple of days.  I was in a car wreck.
L:  So, what -- [LAUGH] what part of California are you in now?
R:  I'm in Clifton Macer which is just, uh -- I'm about ten miles south of Disneyland.
L:  Oh, man.  Okay.  Man, that's -- that's a long way from here in my eyes but --
R:  Yeah, that's right.  That's kinda weird.
L:  -- you did been here.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, it's weird that North Augusta's like that but you don't really realize that you're in, you know, south -- I mean it is -- is that it's an entirely different state that you're -- you know, you've gone from one place to another, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, [inaudible] should be just going over the bridge there.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it's, uh, I mean censor- censorship is a -- is a crazy thing because, you know, it's like you don't, uh --
L:  Uh-huh, I'm with ya.
R:  It's, uh --
L:  I'm definitely with ya.
R:  It's a difficult -- well, it's a difficult thing because let's -- let's look at the -- you know, let's look at a book like, you know, like Tom Sawyer or something.
L:  Right.
R:  Now, when he's calling -- I'm guessing you're black.
L:  I am.
R:  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] And I'm white so ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, you know, it's one of those --
L:  Okay.
R:  But, you know, if you had a -- if you had some thing where okay, I think the character's name is Nigger Jim.
L:  Right.
R:  Now, that's something that -- that's really offensive.  That's an offensive term --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, but --
L:  Yes, it is.
R:  -- do you want the kids never to understand that back at that time, even though, you know, the characters may be treated not too badly, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that he's considered like a noble kind of person and stuff you wouldn't want the person to ever read Tom Sawyer even though it's a classic book because they use the word nigger, you know.
L:  Okay.
R:  And, you know, that's -- that's debatable because, you know, some -- some kids at some ages may not be able to understand that okay, at that time, that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- wasn't -- wouldn't be as offensive as it would be now but you wouldn't use that kind of term, you know.
L:  I see what you're saying.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, man.  I never thought about that, um, censorship.  I mean, I guess when I -- when I did think about it, or was exposed to it, um, I guess I looked at it as a protection.  Um, they wanted just to direct their -- direct the students in such a, you know, way and just be focused, you know, in that particular, you know, direction so they catered to [MN] -- nine times out of ten they were censored, they'd have -- you know, they'd wear the same clothes every day, you'd have the --
R:  Right.
L:  -- blue, you know, pants and, you know, uniform and it was [MN] -- it was just focused in one direction.  You know, they keep you focused in one thought so to speak.  And I guess that's what it, um -- it was -- it was just another tool to keep you uniform, you know, in whatever direction the school was going, you know, that's how they, you know, used their power to keep you -- keep you focused and so, in my opinion, if you wanted your child a certain way, you know, I guess you would send them to a private school because you knew what they would get.  You know, they would get bam, bam, bam, bam, bam and that would be it, you know.  No deviation to that.  Whereas in public school, you know, everything goes.  So, you know, in -- in -- in that direction I'm not against it but, you know, everybody has a different, you know, appeal to it.  You know, they have a different -- you know, they -- they're not gonna have -- you're gonna have some parents that's not gonna have their kids, you know, do what other kids do and then you're gonna have some kids that, you know, some parents just say, "Well, you know, I want my kid to go to a professional sports so they will have a better look.  You know, they would be seeing a better chance going to a public school if they want to be successful" and, you know, such and such and such and such so they would send them -- right, you wouldn't see too many go to a private school, you know, for --
R:  Well, you know --
L:  -- those reasons.
R:  Well, --
L:  You have some that do but nine times out of ten, you know, they wouldn't want to be seen unless they -- unless, you know, that private school is seen for those reasons.  You know, it would --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- be for those reasons, I -- I think.
R:  Well, it's -- it's kinda tough because can some parents -- you know, I mean [COUGH] you wouldn't want to see like, you know, Playboy --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- in the -- in the school library.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, I'm sure everybody would -- you know, would agree on that but, you know, you -- you get into shades of well, should there be a Bible in the library?
L:  Okay.
R:  Because if -- if you have the -- if you have the Bible in the library, okay what about the Jewish students?  What about the, uh --
L:  Right
R:  -- you know, the, uh, -- or if you have the Bible, then you better have the Koran.
L:  Okay, I see what you're saying.  It is --
R:  So, that you know --
L:  That's true.
R:  And it is one of those things well, okay well then if you don't --
L:  That's so true.
R:  -- if you don't want to have the Bible, then you shouldn't have any -- anything at all.
L:  Anything spiritual.
R:  And --
L:  Anything religious.
R:  You know, so it's one of those things that it's really difficult because the Bible --
L:  Man, I've never thought about that.
R:  -- the Bible also has some -- some --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- good, just non religious -- you know, it's not all religion.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, and the same with --
L:  Anybody gonna do -- anybody gonna do it different so if you're gonna have religion --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's gonna have to, you know, accommodate anybody's belief and --
R:  Yeah, but then how many -- how many --
L:  -- that's -- that can -- that -- that can't happen with so many --
R:  Yeah, [inaudible]
L:  -- different beliefs, you can't.
R:  Yeah, and --
L:  You just -- it just doesn't work.
R:  Yeah, what if you're an atheist and you say --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- hey, now I don't believe in any of this stuff.  Why should my kids be forced to, you know, to go to your school system where they talk about the Bible at all?
L:  Right, that's true.
R:  Yeah, that's -- and that's legitimate too, you know, so --
L:  And that -- that, um, person that didn't believe in it has the same right and the same opportunity and the same privilege to get that teaching that would be given because I have to say, you're gonna -- your child is gonna learn at a private school than they would at a public school.  Nine times out of ten.  I guess, you know, you have some that go to pub- pub schools and valedictorians, you know, and so forth and so forth, A students all the way but the average that go to that private school, the average grade point is gonna be way higher than the average at a public school.  And I guess that comes from, you know, the amount of people 'cause it is less people at a private school.  You know, it's more --
R:  But not everybody can afford to go to a private school.
L:  Right [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, so ...
R:  And then it's like, you know, it's like who gets -- you know, it's like -- 
L:  I -- I -- it doesn't -- that doesn't --
R:  Because it's like you protect 'em --
L:  -- sound fair though -- that doesn't sound fair.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That -- it really doesn't.
R:  No.
L:  It doesn't sound fair.
R:  Because it's like if you wanna -- if you wanna to protect the minority viewpoint but then you don't want the minority viewpoint to say, "Hey, you know, just because --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean there are -- you know, there are folks who -- you know, who are gonna tell you, "Okay, you know, God created the earth --"
L:  right.
R:  "-- and that's that".  
L:  Yeah.  yeah.
R:  You know, and if you -- and if you don't say that God created the earth and that's that, well you're teaching something that I don't want my kids to learn and my kids don't have to go to private school because I pay taxes like everybody else.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And they can come in and say, "Okay, well we want to ban every book that doesn't agree with what -- you know, with what we want to say" so, you know, it's like -- and something like you know, do you want your kids to learn, you know, about homosexuals, uh --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, from a school library.
L:  Right, right, right.
R:  that's what I'm saying.
L:  That's -- that's so true.  And I think every, um, public -- every private school has a different -- you know, a different rule.  You -- I -- [MN] it's just a matter of which one you like, you know.  It's a pick and choose type of thing because each one of them gonna do something different.  They're not gonna all be the -- you know, they're not gonna all be the same and so that's -- that too, you know -- it's -- it's just not, um, it's not fair.  It's not fair.  I don't feel it's fair.  You know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- everybody has their own opinion and that's what we're hear to talk, your own opinion.
R:  Right, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's something -- 'cause, you know, it's like you don't --
L:  'Cause you're not perfect.  You might say what you feel today and then you might get off the phone and say "Oh, you know, I thought about that.  I -- I shouldn't have said that" but, you know, you're thinking it and you may be wrong at the time we're saying it.  We're being recorded but, you know, we're human.  That's what it's -- it's about.
R:  Yeah, well we --
