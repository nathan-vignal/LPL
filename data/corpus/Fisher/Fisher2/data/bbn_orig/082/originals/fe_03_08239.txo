L:  Hi.  This --
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, this is Scott.
R:  [MN]
L:  Um, well.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I think that, uh, you know, that schools should have a certain curriculum that, you know, that they intend to follow and have appropriate books for the curriculum but I don't think that they should, uh, limit other books --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- per se.
R:  I -- I think that, like, um, most of the great books, you know, that -- that people now consider to be, you know, really m- monumental in terms of, like, and how they influenced thought.  You know, have at one point or another been on banned book lists.  And --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so we've seen just exactly how far that goes in terms of actually getting anything done.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, that, like, society doesn't really, you know, get anything from banning books or making it so that people can't read them.  'Cause if they're really that good and that, you know, influential, people will read them.
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.  Um, uh, [NOISE] like, I -- I -- I knew somebody, uh, his -- his, uh, I think he was in eighth grade or seventh grade or something like that.  And he was reading Tolkien.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, his teacher told him not to read it because it -- 'cause he wouldn't understand it.
R:  What?  [LAUGH] 
L:  And I'm, like, that doesn't make any sense.  Obviously you understand it 'cause you're reading it.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, and his mother had to come down to the school and basically, you know, chew out the teacher.
R:  I've never heard of anything like that.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] it -- it -- it was strange.  [NOISE] It was really strange.
R:  Like, if anything, I've had teachers recommend books to me.  I never told them, like, you know, had someone tell me not to read a certain book.
L:  Oh, I know.  I know.  Neither have I but [MN] you know, it -- 
R:  I just thought it's almost like a point of, uh, like, some of our teachers will tell us about how, like, they went to conferences outside of, you know, New York or something and they went somewhere else.  And, like, they were talking about the books they teach and the, like, the people are baffled that they're allowed to teach these books, you know.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  So ...
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Like, um, Huckleberry Finn.
R:  Yeah.  And --
L:  I mean, it's [SIGH] I mean a quarter of the country's banned the book because of one word.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That doesn't make any sense.
R:  Right.
L:  And that -- that's -- that's the reality of the time.
R:  Right.  Well --
L:  You know.
R:  -- people -- people find that easier I think to just sort of step away from these things --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, and say well, if we don't have to deal with it, it's easier than, you know, making it there and making it an issue.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because if they teach it, then they have to bring up why other people can't teach it.
L:  Mhm.  [NOISE] Mhm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a, you know, it -- it's -- it's a similar argument with the, uh, the, uh, evolution versus creationism, that type of thing.
R:  Right.
L:  And, I mean, if -- if you can -- if you're allowed to teach, you know, books, like, the Koran and the Bible --
R:  Right.
L:  -- why can't you teach Darwinism?
R:  Right.  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, [inaudible] 
R:  And I -- I think a lot of it has to do with people not accepting that students, you know, have minds that are, you know, capable of accepting multiple different ideas at once.  You know, that they think well, if we teach them one idea, then they're automatically  going to accept it.  And so if we teach them another idea, it might necessarily conflict, but they might not pick the right one.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There -- they don't want us to pick the one that they want us to pick.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, and si- and that -- that's typical actually because, um, you know, the parents teach -- teach their children, you know, to think certain ways, and to do things certain ways.  And that's just -- that's the nature of the beast --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- but, you know, I don't think that, you know, um, that it's up to society in general to teach individuals specifically.  I mean, they're going to learn from society but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, I think it's the parents' job to, uh, directly influence their children in such a way, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I w- -- I w- -- I don't think I would ever tell my children, "No, you can't read this book because, you know, it's -- it's bad" --
R:  Right.  
L:  -- or whatever.  [NOISE] 
R:  You might tell them, you know, that that book ha- you know, is controversial or that some people don't like it, but you -- you don't tell them you -- you can't read it cause --
L:  -- Yeah.  I mean, as a matter of act, the more controversial the -- the subject --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I would probably --
R:  Say. "You should read it".  [COUGH] 
L:  -- Yeah, exactly.  Encourage them.  [NOISE] 
R:  Because you should --
L:  You know --
R:  -- you should, like, go to books so that you can get all the different angles about something, you know.  [MN]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Find out what -- what's going on from someone else's perspective that you might not necessarily agree with.  You know, if you only read the things that you agree with, then you're never going to learn anything really.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, [NOISE] you know, then you're gonna be rather ill prepared for the real world.
R:  The real world.  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, 'cause you're [NOISE] gonna have your opinion and everybody else is gonna be wrong.
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  And I -- [NOISE] I don't think that -- I don't think that's the way it should be.  So ...
R:  Yes.  Censorship is bad.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] So, are you a student?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [MN] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, me too.  I'm, uh, I'm in college.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  Just about there.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Another couple of weeks.
L:  Oh, congratulations.
R:  Thanks.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I remember, uh, graduating from high school was a pretty big deal for me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, [PAUSE] um --
R:  Learn about the world [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Meet people that aren't necessarily from your particular little area and --
L:  mm.
R:  -- aren't necessarily thinking the same things.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, what was the, uh, what do you think was probably the most controversial topic or subject that you read about or discussed in school?
R:  Um, I feel like a lot of books we read, uh, were sort of not on the -- the, like, accepted reading list so to speak, you know.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then we read a lot of things that, uh, sort of pushed the boundaries of that.  Like, we read, uh, the -- the Unbearable Likeness of Being.  Um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in English class.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, it is a literary work.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, um, I never read the book.  I saw --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the movie.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I -- I really can't make any judgments as to the similarities but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I mean, I thought the movie was fantastic.  
R:  Yeah.  Well, it's like, it -- it's a really brilliant book.  It's just not one that you would expect them to sort of teach to high school students.  And like --
L:  That's true.  That's true.
R:  -- I -- I'm really happy that they did 'cause I -- I think it's a great work and, you know he's a great writer.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I -- I think that fr- -- if they were to, you know, not teach it and so say, you know, that well, we're not, you know, mature enough or, like, that people might not find it acceptable --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like, I think we would have lost something.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, oh, I know, I also -- I know somebody else who, uh, was [PAUSE] uh, kind of well, discouraged from reading Lady Chatterley's Lover because she was too young.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And -- and this person thought that the book was just fantastic.  You know, it -- it's not what a lot of people think it is.
R:  Right.
L:  And, uh, [PAUSE] so, she -- she got a little -- a lot out of it.  [PAUSE] But, uh, I -- you know, again the fact that somebody would say, "No, you can't read that.  You're -- you're too young".  I mean, okay -- 
R:  And -- and who's to decide, you know when you are too young?  
L:  -- you -- you don't make a five read it.  Okay, I can understand not making a five year old --
R:  Right.
L:  -- read something like that.  But, you know, I mean, a teenager--
R:  Right. 
L:  Come on.  I -- I -- I would think that this is -- would be something that they would, you know, want to be exposed to in a safe manner.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, sexuality, sensuality, all that.  So [NOISE] -- you know, it 
R:  I -- I and --
L:  -- you know, it -- 
R:  -- it's the whole argument of do you want to just keep people in innocent about things?  Or do you want them to know about them, and have heard about them so that it's an open discussion topic.  
L:  Mhm.  
R:  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  Mhm.  Exactly.
R:  And I -- I personally think it's better to have it be out there.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  [SIGH] [several inaudible words] Once again, you know if -- if you don't, then you just have a bunch of closed minded rabbits --
R:  Right.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know, or sheep and, you know, you get those -- those few people who actually, you know are educated and understanding things and that know about these things and they're the one- --
