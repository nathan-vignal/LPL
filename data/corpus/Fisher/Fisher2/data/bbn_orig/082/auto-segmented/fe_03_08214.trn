SO SO DID THEY TAKE A SCHOOL VOTE OF THE PARENTS ABOUT THE BOOKS  (fe_03_08214-A-0027)
WOW  (fe_03_08214-A-0028)
YEAH YEAH  (fe_03_08214-A-0029)

YOU KNOW LOOK I UNDERSTAND THERE WOULD BE CERTAIN TOPICS THAT COULD BE OFF LIMITS LIKE SAY THEY DON'T WANT KIDS READING ABOUT LIKE UM HOW YOU KNOW AH  (fe_03_08214-A-0032)
AH CONTACTING GHOSTS OR YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT A KID MIGHT BE CURIOUS TO READ BUT UM PROBABLY YOU SHOULDN'T BE READING I GUESS BUT  (fe_03_08214-A-0033)
UM IT'S LIKE WHERE'S THE LIMIT AND HOW FAR DO YOU TAKE IT  (fe_03_08214-A-0034)
AND AND TO BE HONEST I I HAVEN'T MYSELF READ ANY OF THE HARRY POTTER BOOKS I THINK IT'S A GOOD EXAMPLE THOUGH I ONLY SAW THE FIRST MOVIE BUT I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING ANTI CHRISTIAN IN IT  (fe_03_08214-A-0035)
YEAH YEAH  (fe_03_08214-A-0036)
MHM  (fe_03_08214-A-0037)

YEAH  (fe_03_08214-A-0039)
OH REALLY  (fe_03_08214-A-0040)
I HEAR YOU AND NOT ONLY THAT IT'S THE PEOPLE WHO REALLY OVER EXAGGERATE I REMEMBER GROWING UP UM  (fe_03_08214-A-0043)
I BECAUSE WE READ MOSTLY ENGLISH BOOKS SO UM I HAD A BOOK BY I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THE AUTHOR EDNID- ENID BLYTON  (fe_03_08214-A-0044)
WHO HAD TWO CHARACTERS UM THAT WERE  (fe_03_08214-A-0045)
UM  (fe_03_08214-A-0046)
THAT ONE WAS LIKE A DWARF AND THE OTHER WAS JUST A LIKE A YOUNG BOY AND THEY AND THEY HAD THE BOY HAD ADVENTURES AND HE'D STAY OVER AT THE  (fe_03_08214-A-0047)
THE DWARF'S HOUSE AND BECAUSE THEY SLEPT IN THE SAME BED AT A AT ONE POINT AFTER I'D READ IT ALL THROUGH MY CHILDHOOD AND NOW WAS A TEENAGER  (fe_03_08214-A-0048)
THEY DECIDED THAT B- THAT IT WAS PROMOTING HOMOSEXUALITY HAVING THE TWO MEN MALES SLEEPING IN ONE BED  (fe_03_08214-A-0049)
AND THEY AND IT CAUSED A HUGE UPROAR AND I MEAN IT'S LIKE HOW FAR DO YOU KNOW PEOPLE TAKE THESE THINGS YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08214-A-0050)
I WAS I WAS IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IT WAS THAT THAT AGE GROUP I MEAN IT W- IT WAS REALLY SOMETHING AH UM  (fe_03_08214-A-0051)
AH YOU KNOW UM YEAH I MEAN IT'S FOR KID- YOUNG KIDS THEY HAD PICTURES AND AND STUFF IN THE BOOKS  (fe_03_08214-A-0052)
UM  (fe_03_08214-A-0053)
YEAH YEAH AND AND THE TRUTH IS IS THAT UM LOOK ALL THESE THINGS ARE OUT THERE IN THE WORLD YOU CAN KEEP YOUR KIDS EX- YOU KNOW AH SHUT OFF FROM IT FOR  (fe_03_08214-A-0054)
SO ONLY SO LONG OF COURSE YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO SEE THINGS THAT THEY REALLY SHOULDN'T LIKE PORNOGRAPHY OR ANYTHING WHICH ACTUALLY IS IT'S MORE OF A CONCERN I THINK THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT ON THE INTERNET AND THE KIDS WHAT THEY GET ON THE EMAILS AND THAT'S EVEN IN  (fe_03_08214-A-0055)
IN THE SCHOOLS THEY'RE STILL GETTING EMAILS I MEAN S._P._A._M. GETS THROUGH I THINK THAT'S MORE OF A PROBLEM REGARDING CENSORSHIP THAN KEEPING BOOKS IN LIBRARIES OR WHAT BOOKS KIDS CAN READ IN TERMS OF BOOKS  (fe_03_08214-A-0056)
YEAH  (fe_03_08214-A-0058)
AND THE IRONY IS ALL THE HOOPLA AROUND IT MAKES KIDS SOMETIMES WANT TO READ IT EVEN MORE BECAUSE WHY ARE THEY FUSSING SO MUCH LET'S SEE WHAT THERE IS THERE  (fe_03_08214-A-0059)
SO IT DEFEATS THE WHOLE PURPOSE ULTIMATELY  (fe_03_08214-A-0060)
SO SO HAS THE WHOLE THING DIED DOWN AT YOUR SCHOOL NOW  (fe_03_08214-A-0061)
MHM  (fe_03_08214-A-0062)
MHM  (fe_03_08214-A-0063)
MHM  (fe_03_08214-A-0064)
OH GOSH  (fe_03_08214-A-0065)
SO THERE'S NO PARENT COMMITTEE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHERE PARENTS' OPINIONS ARE REFLECTED OR REPRESENTED  (fe_03_08214-A-0066)
KIDS MHM  (fe_03_08214-A-0067)
SO THOSE THOSE ARE THE PARENTS THAT ACTUALLY VOTED IT OUT  (fe_03_08214-A-0068)
YEAH  (fe_03_08214-A-0069)
ABSOLUTELY AND THAT ALSO SHOWS YOU HOW IT DEFEATS THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING YOU CAN'T CONTROL WHAT KIDS ARE GOING TO READ ESPECIALLY IF IT'S A KIDS' BOOK  (fe_03_08214-A-0071)
YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT'S REALLY UP TO THE PARENTS TO TO AH GUIDE THE KIDS CORRECTLY AGAIN THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH THEY CAN DO IN SCHOOLS BUT YOU KNOW KIDS DON'T SPEND ALL THEIR TIME IN SCHOOLS WHAT TIME DO YOU WHAT TIME DO YOUR KIDS GET OUT OF SCHOOL  (fe_03_08214-A-0072)
SO IT'S QUITE A LONG DAY FOR YOUR KIDS  (fe_03_08214-A-0073)
MHM  (fe_03_08214-A-0074)
OH GOSH VERY NICE  (fe_03_08214-A-0076)
MHM  (fe_03_08214-A-0077)
WOW  (fe_03_08214-A-0078)
YEAH  (fe_03_08214-A-0079)
HELLO  (fe_03_08214-B-0001)
HI  (fe_03_08214-B-0002)
HI PHILIPPA MY NAME IS MICHELLE QUINN  (fe_03_08214-B-0003)
HOW ARE YOU  (fe_03_08214-B-0004)
GOOD WHERE ARE YOU FROM PHILIPPA  (fe_03_08214-B-0005)
OKAY  (fe_03_08214-B-0006)
UM WE LIVE IN MICHIGAN GREAT RAPIDS MICHIGAN WHICH IS THE WEST SIDE OF THE STATE  (fe_03_08214-B-0007)
[LAUGHTER] THEN PLEASE ACCEPT MY APOLOGIES FOR THAT  (fe_03_08214-B-0008)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08214-B-0009)
UM I HAVE TWO CHILDREN MY ELDEST IS EIGHT AND A HALF HE IS A BOY HE'LL BE GOING INTO THIRD GRADE IN THE FALL AND THEN MY YOUNGEST IS SIX AND A HALF HE'LL BE GOING INTO FIRST GRADE IN THE FALL  (fe_03_08214-B-0010)
WE HAVE A A READER AND THEN A A STURD- A EARLY READER  (fe_03_08214-B-0011)
HOW ABOUT YOURSELF PHILIPPA DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN ALSO  (fe_03_08214-B-0012)
OH CONGRATULATIONS MHM MHM MHM  (fe_03_08214-B-0013)
WELL IT'S INTERESTING THE THE TOPIC THAT THEY CHOSE FOR US TO TALK ON UM OUR CHILDREN BOTH ATTEND A PRIVATE SCHOOL  (fe_03_08214-B-0014)
AND ONE OF THE HOT TOPICS LAST YEAR AT OUR SCHOOL THEY REMOVED ALL OF THE HARRY POTTER BOOKS FROM OUR LIBRARY AND WELL IT WAS GREATLY DEBATED BY THE TEACHERS THE OTHER STAFF AND THE PARENTS  (fe_03_08214-B-0015)
UM SOME OF THE ADMINISTRATORS AND THE STAFF BELIEVED THAT THEY PRESENT A NON CHRISTIAN VIEW  (fe_03_08214-B-0016)
WELL YEAH AND I I THINK YOU AND I ARE PROBABLY THINKING ON THE SAME TERMS THAT I I PERSONALLY THINK ANY TIME YOU CAN GET ANY CHILD TO HAVE AN INTEREST IN ANY BOOK AND EXERCISE LANGUAGE ARTS AND INCREASE HIS OR HER UM READING LEVEL  (fe_03_08214-B-0017)
NINETY PERCENT OF THE TIME I'M PRETTY HAPPY WITH ABOUT ANY BOOK THAT MY KIDS CAN SIT DOWN AND ACTUALLY WILL ACTUALLY READ VOLUNTARILY  (fe_03_08214-B-0018)
UM IT IS IT'S CON- IT'S UNDER A GENERAL UMBRELLA OF CHRISTIAN UM A CHRISTIAN SCHOOL HOWEVER  (fe_03_08214-B-0019)
I WOULD SAY EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE CHILDREN THAT ATTEND THAT SCHOOL ARE C._R._C. WHICH IS THE CHRISTIAN REFORMED CHURCH  (fe_03_08214-B-0020)
WE ARE WE ARE NOT MEMBERS OF THE C._R._C. OUR FAMILY IS LUTHERAN SO WE DON'T NECESSARILY FIT THE TYPICAL MOULD OF THE TRA- TRADITIONAL FAMILY THAT ATTENDS THIS SCHOOL  (fe_03_08214-B-0021)
SO WITH THAT SAID OUR VIEWS MIGHT BE DIFFERENT JUST FROM THE ON ON MOST MOST TOPICS OF DISCUSSION  (fe_03_08214-B-0022)
THEY DID NOT THEY [LAUGHTER] AND THAT WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE REASONS WHY IT WAS A BIT CONTROVERSIAL UM  (fe_03_08214-B-0023)
IT WAS PRIMARILY DECIDED UPON BY THE SCHOOL BOARD AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE FOLKS TO TAKE THE BOOKS OUT OF THE LIBRARY  (fe_03_08214-B-0024)
AND AND THAT WASN'T HALF THE PROBLEM UM BECAUSE ANYONE CAN GO OUT AND EITHER PURCHASE THE BOOK OR GO TO THE PUBLIC LIBRARY AND AND UM F- YOU KNOW RENT THE BOOK  (fe_03_08214-B-0025)
SO THAT WASN'T NEAR THE PROBLEM AS THE JUST THE FACT THAT THEY WERE MAKING SUCH A BOLD STATEMENT REGARDING THE BOOK ITSELF  (fe_03_08214-B-0026)
I KNOW  (fe_03_08214-B-0027)
MHM YEAH YEAH I'VE READ ALL FIVE BOOKS I JUST FINISHED UP THE MOST RECENT ONE LAST WEEK WHILE I WAS ON VACATION AND IN MY OPINION THERE'S NOTHING IN THERE THAT SCREAMS OUT UM  (fe_03_08214-B-0029)
ANTI CHRISTIANITY I I I PERSONALLY HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THE BOOKS AT ALL MY SON AH THE READING LEVEL FOR ESPECIALLY THE FIFTH BOOK IS IS HIGHER THAN THE FIRST FOUR SO FOR HIM TO TACKLE THAT BOOK WOULD BE DIFFICULT ON HIS OWN  (fe_03_08214-B-0030)
YEAH A MORE EXPERIENCED READER AND HE ASKS ME DAILY TO READ CHAPTERS OUT OF THIS BOOK  (fe_03_08214-B-0031)
YEAH SO I'M HOPING YOU KNOW THAT SHE CONTINUES OR WE CAN FIND STUMBLE ACROSS ANOTHER SERIES OF BOOKS THAT WILL BE A LITTLE BIT CLOSER ALIGNED TO HIS READING ABILITY FOR HIM HE STRUGGLES IN LANGUAGE ARTS SO  (fe_03_08214-B-0032)
IT I MEAN IF HE FINDS AN INTEREST IN A BOOK THERE'S VERY LITTLE THAT I WILL DO TO STOP HIM FROM READING  (fe_03_08214-B-0033)
MHM  (fe_03_08214-B-0035)
MHM  (fe_03_08214-B-0036)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08214-B-0037)
SURE NOW HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN YOU READ THAT BOOK  (fe_03_08214-B-0039)
SURE MHM SO THE LIKELIHOOD OF YOU SAYING OOH THIS IS ABOUT GAYS AND HOMOSEXUALITY IS SLIM TO BEGIN WITH JUST BECAUSE YOUR KNOWLEDGE BASE OF AN ALTERNATIVE LIFESTYLE WAS LIMITED TO BEGIN WITH UM  (fe_03_08214-B-0041)
MHM  (fe_03_08214-B-0042)
MHM  (fe_03_08214-B-0043)
MHM  (fe_03_08214-B-0044)
SURE AND HOPEFULLY THEIR ENERGIES THEY COULD YOU KNOW IF YOU HAD YOUR CHOICE YOU COULD REDIRECT THEIR ENERGIES TOWARD TOPICS THAT ARE OF MUCH MORE CONCERN THAN WHETHER OR NOT A HARRY POTTER BOOK SHOULD BE IN A  (fe_03_08214-B-0046)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_08214-B-0048)
UH-HUH EXACTLY  (fe_03_08214-B-0049)
IT HAS BUT NOW THE FIFTH BOOK HAS COME OUT IN THE SUMMER TIME SO I'M CURIOUS TO SEE IF IT WILL UM  (fe_03_08214-B-0051)
AH RESURFACE SOME TIME IN THE FALL THERE ARE ONE OR TWO PARTICULAR AH TEACHERS AT THE OLDER SCHOOL OUR WE HAVE TWO SCHOOLS PHYSICAL BUILDINGS WITHIN OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM ONE SCHOOL GOES FROM PRESCHOOL TO SECOND GRADE AND THE NEXT SCHOOL GOES FROM THIRD TO EIGHTH  (fe_03_08214-B-0052)
I BELIEVE HE IS A SEVENTH GRADE TEACHER AND THE OTHER TEACHER'S AN EIGHTH GRADE TEACHER AND THESE WERE THE TWO FOLKS THAT LEAD THE TRAIN UM REGARDING TAKING THE HARRY POTTER BOOKS OUT OF THE LIBRARY  (fe_03_08214-B-0053)
SO I'LL BE VERY INTERESTED UM  (fe_03_08214-B-0054)
TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE FALL  (fe_03_08214-B-0055)
WELL YEAH THE THE SCHOOL BOARD DOES CONSIST OF ABOUT NINE PEOPLE OF WHICH ALL ARE PARENTS THAT HAVE PARENTS OR EXCUSE ME THAT HAVE CHILDREN IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM UM BUT YOU KNOW YOU BRING UP A GOOD POINT IT DOES CERTAINLY DOES NOT REPRESENT  (fe_03_08214-B-0056)
YOU KNOW NINE OUT OF TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY FAMILIES THAT ATTEND THE SCHOOL  (fe_03_08214-B-0057)
WELL THOSE ARE THE PARENTS THAT SIT ON THE SCHOOL BOARD YOU KNOW ONE PERSON MIGHT BE IN CHARGE OF FINANCE ANOTHER PERSON'S IN CHARGE OF BUILDING REPAIR  (fe_03_08214-B-0058)
ET CETERA THOSE ARE THE NINE PEOPLE THAT DISCUSSED AT LENGTH ALONG WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE TEACHERS AND CAME TO THE DECISION TO TAKE IT OUT IT IT WAS CLEARLY A A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE SCHOOL BUT I BUT I'LL TELL YOU I  (fe_03_08214-B-0059)
YOU KNOW EVEN IF THEY INVOLVED FORTY OR FIFTY MORE PARENTS I DON'T KNOW IF THEY WOULD GET FULL SUPPORT TO BRING THOSE BOOKS BACK IN  (fe_03_08214-B-0060)
I THINK IT IT SENDS A STATEMENT CERTAINLY MUCH MORE SO THAN A COUPLE OF BOOKS ARE MISSING FROM THE LIBRARY THE KIDS ARE GOING TO GET THE BOOKS YOU KNOW IF THEY REALLY WANT TO READ THEM THEY CAN GO ANYWHERE TO GET THEM  (fe_03_08214-B-0061)
MHM  (fe_03_08214-B-0062)
MHM  (fe_03_08214-B-0063)
YEAH  (fe_03_08214-B-0064)
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT'S A PERFECT EXAMPLE RIGHT THERE  (fe_03_08214-B-0065)
MHM  (fe_03_08214-B-0066)
UM THEY START SCHOOL AT EIGHT TWENTY THREE AND THEY FINISH UP AT THREE TWENTY THREE  (fe_03_08214-B-0067)
UM I WISH IT WERE A BIT LONGER I I FEEL YOU KNOW I'M IN THE CLASSROOM BOTH OF MY CHILDREN HAVE LEARNING DEFICITS IN LANGUAGE ARTS THEY'RE VERY BRIGHT AND TALENTED IN MATH AND SCIENCE BUT I FEEL THAT I NEED TO BE THERE TO HELP THEM ALONG AND PUSH THEM ALONG  (fe_03_08214-B-0068)
SO I VOLUNTEER IN BOTH OF THEIR CLASSROOMS ONE DAY A WEEK  (fe_03_08214-B-0069)
UM  (fe_03_08214-B-0070)
YEAH AND IT'S FUN I WAS NOT ABLE TO DO THIS PRIOR TO LEAVING MY JOB TWO YEARS AGO SO THIS HAS BEEN A REAL BIG EYE OPENER FOR OUR ENTIRE FAMILY BUT I SEE HOW MUCH TIME THEY SPEND IN SCHOOL  (fe_03_08214-B-0071)
AND I KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY KIDS AT A YOUNGER AGE THAT THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR RECESS AND GYM AND RELATIVELY NON ACADEMIC THINGS THAT I WOULD PUT UNDER THE CATEGORY OF NON ACADEMIC  (fe_03_08214-B-0072)
AND I CRINGE TO THINK WOW LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT CAN I BE DOING WITH THIS FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MINUTES YOU KNOW THAT IN MY OPINION IS SOMETHING THAT ISN'T PRODUCTIVE  (fe_03_08214-B-0073)
SO I WOULD BE THRILLED TO SEE MAYBE EVEN A SLIGHTLY LONGER DAY TO GET MORE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY  (fe_03_08214-B-0074)
IN THERE UM JENNIFER GRANDHOLD WHO IS OUR GOVERNOR FOR THE STATE OF MICHIGAN JUST TURNED DOWN A PROPOSAL TO TURN IT IN TURN THE SCHOOL WEEK INTO A FOUR DAY  (fe_03_08214-B-0075)
