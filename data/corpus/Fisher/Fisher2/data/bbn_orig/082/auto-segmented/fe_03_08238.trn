I MEAN THAT LIKE I SAID THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE PENTHOUSE AND PLAYBOY IN I DON'T THINK THAT'S NECESSARY READING FOR A HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARY  (fe_03_08238-A-0030)
BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN NOVELS THAT YOU KNOW UM SCHOOL AND EDUCATION IS TO OPEN OUR MINDS TO SOMETHING WE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO SEE OR EXPERIENCE IN OUR OWN SURROUNDINGS  (fe_03_08238-A-0031)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08238-A-0032)

HAVE NO IDEA REALLY WHAT RACISM IS AND OTHERS WHO WHO STILL YOU KNOW LIVE IN AREAS WHERE THEY'RE ALMOST LIKE THE SIXTIES RACISM STILL LIVES IT'S JUST NOT AS  (fe_03_08238-A-0034)

I DON'T KNOW CONTROLLED OR LIMITED  (fe_03_08238-A-0059)
IT SHOULDN'T WIDE SPREAD  (fe_03_08238-A-0060)

WELL YOU KNOW I THINK THERE IS A NEED FOR STANDARD CURRICULUM BECAUSE WE AS AMERICANS ARE STUPID  (fe_03_08238-A-0066)
I'VE TRAVELED ENOUGH [MN] OVERSEAS TO KNOW MOST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND A LOT OF ASIAN COUNTRIES REQUIRE ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE  (fe_03_08238-A-0067)
THERE'S VERY FEW PLACES THAT WELL THERE'S SEVERAL PLACES IN THE STATES THAT PEOPLE HAVE DUAL LANGUAGES  (fe_03_08238-A-0068)
BUT IT'S VERY RARELY  (fe_03_08238-A-0069)
MANDATORY TO HAVE OR ALMOST MANDATORY TO HAVE A SECOND LANGUAGE  (fe_03_08238-A-0070)
A LOT OF PEOPLE DO IN SOME AREAS OF THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE THEY COME FROM A DIFFERENT BACKGROUND  (fe_03_08238-A-0071)

HELLO  (fe_03_08238-B-0001)
GREG THIS IS SHAUN HOW ARE YOU  (fe_03_08238-B-0002)
UH IT WAS  (fe_03_08238-B-0003)
[COUGH] DO YOU THINK PUBLIC SCHOOLS SHOULD BE ABLE TO  (fe_03_08238-B-0004)
REQUIRE BOOKS  (fe_03_08238-B-0005)
TO REQUIRE CERTAIN READING OF BOOKS  (fe_03_08238-B-0006)
YEAH  (fe_03_08238-B-0007)
I  (fe_03_08238-B-0008)
OH OKAY  (fe_03_08238-B-0009)
WELL I THINK IT'S PART OF HAVING A STANDARD CURRICULUM FOR MOST PEOPLE TO HAVE READING 'CAUSE THERE'S CERTAIN  (fe_03_08238-B-0010)
BOOKS THAT ARE A PART OF AMERICAN HISTORY  (fe_03_08238-B-0011)
MM WHAT ABOUT YOU [MN]  (fe_03_08238-B-0012)
THE CATCHER IN THE RYE I KNOW OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD IS  (fe_03_08238-B-0013)
BEEN A SOURCE OF UH DEBATE  (fe_03_08238-B-0014)
HAVE YOU HEARD OF THE CATCHER OF THE RYE  (fe_03_08238-B-0015)
UH IT WAS LET'S  (fe_03_08238-B-0016)
SEE I DON'T REMEMBER OFF THE IT WAS ABOUT A KID AND HE  (fe_03_08238-B-0017)
THAT'S TRUE  (fe_03_08238-B-0020)
BUT [NOISE] I THINK UH MOST OF THE BOOKS THAT KIDS READ TODAY ARE AT SCHOOL  (fe_03_08238-B-0021)
THEY DON'T DO MUCH OUTSIDE READING O- OF THEIR OWN  (fe_03_08238-B-0022)
AS FAR AS UH T- UH NOVELS  (fe_03_08238-B-0023)
SO I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE SCHOOLS TO  (fe_03_08238-B-0024)
TO REQUIRE CERTAIN KINDS OF READING AND BAN CERTAIN OTHER ONES IF THEY FEEL  (fe_03_08238-B-0025)
THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARY FOR THEIR  (fe_03_08238-B-0026)
EDU- OR IT'S NOT NECESSARY FOR  (fe_03_08238-B-0027)
CERTAIN  (fe_03_08238-B-0028)
[MN] IF IT'S NOT A YOU KNOW NECESSARY [NOISE]  (fe_03_08238-B-0029)
COULD BE POTENTIALLY BAD  (fe_03_08238-B-0030)
FOR A STUDENT  (fe_03_08238-B-0031)
THAT'S TRUE  (fe_03_08238-B-0032)
MHM  (fe_03_08238-B-0033)
YEAH YEAH I'VE HEARD SOME EXTREME CASES LIKE THAT  (fe_03_08238-B-0034)
YEAH I AGREE TOO MHM  (fe_03_08238-B-0036)
YEAH I I THINK UH  (fe_03_08238-B-0037)
IF TEACHERS EVEN TODAY IT IT'S ALL RIGHT TO READ THE BOOK BUT AS LONG AS THEY DISCUSS WHY THEY PEOPLE FEEL IT SHOULD BE BANNED JUST DISCUSSING WHY WOULD BE KINDA OPENS THE EYES OF KIDS  (fe_03_08238-B-0038)
TODAY TO  (fe_03_08238-B-0039)
THIS THE ISSUES THAT ARE TALKED ABOUT AMONGST THEIR PARENTS AND THAT WAY JUST TALKING ABOUT IT WILL UH ENLIGHTEN THEM ABOUT THE THE CERTAIN ISSUES ABOUT RACISM FOR EXAMPLE  (fe_03_08238-B-0040)
'CAUSE THAT'S A BIG TALK OF IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE BOOKS THAT ARE  (fe_03_08238-B-0041)
YEAH MAY I ASK WHERE YOU'RE CALLING FROM  (fe_03_08238-B-0042)
OH AH CALIFORNIA UH-HUH  (fe_03_08238-B-0043)
THAT'S TRUE  (fe_03_08238-B-0044)
YEAH AND I THINK THAT'S  (fe_03_08238-B-0045)
ONE THING THAT  (fe_03_08238-B-0046)
IS HARD TO  (fe_03_08238-B-0047)
TO TEACH KIDS IN BOOKS TRY TO DO  (fe_03_08238-B-0048)
YEAH  (fe_03_08238-B-0049)
BUT IT'S HA- SOMETIMES HARD FOR A PARENT TO GO AGAINST THE CURRICULUM TH- THEN  (fe_03_08238-B-0050)
IT'S KIND OF IF THEY'RE REQUIRED TO READ IT BUT THE PARENTS ARE TELLING THEM IT'S NOT TRUE OR DON'T BELIEVE ANYTHING THEY SAY IT KINDA TAKES AWAY THE CREDIBILITY OF THE SCHOOL  (fe_03_08238-B-0051)
'CAUSE IDEALLY I THINK A PARENT WOULD LIKE TO  (fe_03_08238-B-0052)
H- H- PUT  (fe_03_08238-B-0053)
LIKE THEIR CHILDREN TO  (fe_03_08238-B-0054)
TRUST THE SCHOOL THAT THEY GO TO AND WHAT THEY LEARN OR WHAT THEY TEACH 'EM  (fe_03_08238-B-0055)
YEAH  (fe_03_08238-B-0056)
SO IT COULD HAVE A POSITIVE 'CAUSE I THINK IT'S ALWAYS GOOD JUST ANY KIND OF READING FOR A KID IT'S JUST BUILDING THEIR ANALYTICAL OR THEIR  (fe_03_08238-B-0058)
THEIR READING SKILLS  (fe_03_08238-B-0059)
YEAH  (fe_03_08238-B-0063)
YEAH AND I THINK [MN] THE MULTIPLE CASES THE SUPREME COURT HAS RULED IN FAVOR OF JUST YOU KNOW IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ THE BOOK THEN DON'T READ IT  (fe_03_08238-B-0065)
THEY SAID IT'S I- IT'S JUST GIVING FREEDOM  (fe_03_08238-B-0066)
YEAH  (fe_03_08238-B-0067)
SO I HATE I- I- IF THEY PUT A ALTERNATIVE TO A BOOK THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE [MN] CERTAIN PARENTS 'CAUSE I KNOW TODAY THEY SAY LIKE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ THIS BOOK OR  (fe_03_08238-B-0068)
I- I- I- SPECIAL CASES LIKE SEXUAL EDUCATION PARENTS HAVE THE FREEDOM TO TAKE THEIR KIDS OUT OF THAT  (fe_03_08238-B-0069)
I- IF THEY IF THEY WANTED TO THEY COULD HAVE ALTERNATIVE BOOKS  (fe_03_08238-B-0070)
AND YOU KNOW IF THERE WAS ENOUGH PEOPLE  (fe_03_08238-B-0071)
YOU KNOW HALF THE CLASS DIDN'T WANT TO THEN [MN]  (fe_03_08238-B-0072)
THEY'D HAVE TO BOTH HAVE I GUESS IT CAN GO EITHER WAY WITH THE BOOK BUT IF THERE'S A JUST A CERTAIN GROUP [NOISE]  (fe_03_08238-B-0073)
Y- YOU KNOW THEY COULD PROBABLY JUST EACH THOSE GROUPS THAT BOOK AND ANOTHER BOOK IT DOES TAKE AWAY FROM A STANDARD EDUCATION THOUGH STANDARD CURRICULUM BUT  (fe_03_08238-B-0074)
