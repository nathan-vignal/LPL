HI KEVIN MY NAME IS MYRA LANEY HOW ARE YOU  (fe_03_08209-A-0001)
I AM FROM MATHEW SOUTH CAROLINA  (fe_03_08209-A-0003)
OH NOW THIS IS THIS'LL BE NICE BECAUSE THIS IS A NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN PERSPECTIVE ON THIS  (fe_03_08209-A-0005)
OH WHAT PART  (fe_03_08209-A-0006)
OKAY IT'S A LITTLE BIT  (fe_03_08209-A-0007)
I'M NEAR THE CHARLOTTE AREA  (fe_03_08209-A-0008)
YEAH MHM AND CENSORSHIP IS THE BIG UM  (fe_03_08209-A-0009)
FACET OF PUBLIC EDUCATION AND PRIVATE EDUCATION HERE THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT LITERATURE UM THAT IS BROUGHT TO PUBLIC  (fe_03_08209-A-0010)
SCHOOLS AND THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS TOO  (fe_03_08209-A-0011)
UM IT'S ALWAYS A HOT TOPIC OF DEBATE  (fe_03_08209-A-0012)
IN THIS AREA DO YOU I TEACH IN A PUBLIC SCHOOL I TEACH AT ALL TORRY ELEMENTARY  (fe_03_08209-A-0013)
AND WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY ISSUES OF CENSORSHIP COME UP THERE THIS YEAR BUT WE DID AT MATHEW  (fe_03_08209-A-0014)
BEFORE AND IT'S VERY INTERESTING DO YOU HAVE A PUBLIC SCHOOL BACKGROUND DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN  (fe_03_08209-A-0015)
IN OR PRIVATE  (fe_03_08209-A-0016)
SO INCLUDING  (fe_03_08209-A-0019)
PROBABLY MULTI CULTURAL TYPE BOOKS  (fe_03_08209-A-0020)
MHM I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND OFTEN TIMES IT'S JUST LET OUT AND THEY'RE EX- UM ESPECIALLY AND YOU KNOW AND SO MANY THINGS THE SOCIAL HISTORY CULTURE AND THOSE THINGS I WISH UM  (fe_03_08209-A-0021)
THAT WAS THE TYPE OF CENSORSHIP WE HAD ONE OF THE CENSORSHIP ISSUES THAT CAME UP IN MATHEW WAS  (fe_03_08209-A-0022)
UM  (fe_03_08209-A-0023)
ACTUALLY GOING THROUGH THE STEVEN KELLOGG FOLK TALE BOOKS  (fe_03_08209-A-0024)
THE STEVEN KELLOGG THE AUTHOR AND ILLUSTRATOR AND THE BOOKS ARE FOLK TALES AND IT'S MIGHT SINK AND UM DRAW ME A STAR  (fe_03_08209-A-0026)
JOHNNY APPLESEED THOSE BOOKS AND  (fe_03_08209-A-0027)
BUTT NAKED CHILD  (fe_03_08209-A-0029)
THIS LITTLE CHILD BUT THEY ACTUALLY HAD TO DO THAT BECAUSE THE WAY THEY DO IT IS THEY WOULD DO THAT INSTEAD OF AVOID A CONFLICT WELL  (fe_03_08209-A-0031)
YOU KNOW I THINK MAYBE THEY SHOULD AVOID CONFLICT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND MY LITTLE NIECE WAS IN A CLASS  (fe_03_08209-A-0032)
UM  (fe_03_08209-A-0033)
THIS YEAR AND I WOULD THINK AT THIS POINT THIS IS THE ONE ISSUE THAT I FELT LIKE  (fe_03_08209-A-0034)
MY NIECE DID NOT NEED TO BE FORCED TO READ UH THE BOOK AND IT WAS A WHOLE GROUP IT WAS A WHOLE  (fe_03_08209-A-0035)
CLASS THAT WAS READING THE BOOK  (fe_03_08209-A-0036)
AND GARY PAULSEN IS A GREAT AUTHOR  (fe_03_08209-A-0037)
BUT THEY WERE READING HARRY AND ME  (fe_03_08209-A-0038)
AND I DON'T SEE THAT BOOK IN SEVERAL PLACES AS ANY DIFFERENT  (fe_03_08209-A-0039)
UM BECAUSE THERE'S SE- ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE BOOK  (fe_03_08209-A-0042)
IT IS VERY SCARY BECAUSE HE IS A GREAT AUTHOR AND THAT IS A BOOK IF YOU LOOK IT UP ON THE INTERNET THAT IT'S HIGHLY PROMOTED  (fe_03_08209-A-0043)
AND I THINK IT'S PROBABLY A BOOK THAT YOU KNOW SH- MY SISTER CERTAINLY DID NOT WANT IT OUT OF THE LIBRARY BECAUSE ANY BOOK CAN BE USED TO TEACH A CHILD RIGHT AND WRONG  (fe_03_08209-A-0044)
REGARDLESS OF WHAT IS IN IT BUT SHE DID NOT WANT THE WHOLE CLASS  (fe_03_08209-A-0045)
SHE DID NOT WANT ANNA TO BE FORCED TO BE IN A CLASSROOM READING IT AND THAT WAS THE SITUATION UM THE ISSUE WITH THE BOOK IS  (fe_03_08209-A-0046)
THE TWO BOYS ARE  (fe_03_08209-A-0047)
THERE IS ONE OLDER CHILD RE- HARASSING ANOTHER CHILD AND TRYING TO GET HIM TO DO THINGS  (fe_03_08209-A-0048)
AND THEY ACTUALLY I'M ALMOST EMBARRASSED S- SAYING IT AND SINCE YOU'RE A MALE BUT THEY DO THEY ACTUALLY TALK TO THEIR PRIVATE  (fe_03_08209-A-0049)
AND THERE'S UM THERE'S SOME REAL THEY'RE LOOKING AT A PICTURE  (fe_03_08209-A-0050)
AND THEY START GETTING INTO DESCRIPTIONS OF HOW IT FEELS AND UM I JUST THOUGHT YOU KNOW FOR  (fe_03_08209-A-0051)
SHE SHE WAS IN THE UM  (fe_03_08209-A-0052)
SEVENTH GRADE  (fe_03_08209-A-0053)
SEVENTH GRADE  (fe_03_08209-A-0054)
AND AND IT WAS IN A MIXED CLASSROOM  (fe_03_08209-A-0055)
MHM  (fe_03_08209-A-0056)
NOT [LAUGHTER] I THINK IF A PARENT WANTS TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES THEY HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THEIR CHILD BUT THAT IS ONE SITUATION WHERE I REALLY FELT LIKE  (fe_03_08209-A-0057)
AND YOU KNOW MY SISTER ADDRESSED IT CORRECTLY AND THE BOOK WENT ON  (fe_03_08209-A-0058)
SO  (fe_03_08209-A-0059)
THERE WAS NOTHING  (fe_03_08209-A-0060)
BE DONE ABOUT IT I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A DIFFERENCE THOUGH IN WHAT YOU LEAVE ON A LIBRARY SHELF FOR FREE CHOICE AND WHAT A CHILD READS IT IN A CLASSROOM AS A GROUP I THINK IF IT'S A GROUP BOOK THAT EVERYBODY HAS TO READ THAT IT NEEDS TO BE IN AN AWARD WINNING BOOK OR  (fe_03_08209-A-0061)
SOMETHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT OR SOMETHING WORTH READING  (fe_03_08209-A-0062)
I THINK SO AND I DON'T THINK  (fe_03_08209-A-0063)
MOST ADULTS WOULD APPRECIATE  (fe_03_08209-A-0064)
THAT PIECE OF LITERATURE EITHER  (fe_03_08209-A-0065)
