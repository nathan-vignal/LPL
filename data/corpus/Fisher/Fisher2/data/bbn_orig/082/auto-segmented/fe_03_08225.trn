HI JOHN  (fe_03_08225-A-0003)
THAT'S THE WAY I UNDERSTOOD IT YES IN PRIVATE OR  (fe_03_08225-A-0004)
OR  (fe_03_08225-A-0005)

I THINK THAT UM  (fe_03_08225-A-0010)
SOME REGULATION INTO  (fe_03_08225-A-0011)
INTO WHAT THEY READ IS  (fe_03_08225-A-0012)
[SIGH] PROBABLY A NECESSITY IN IN KEEPING ON TRACK WITH WHERE THEY'RE GOING BUT I THINK THAT  (fe_03_08225-A-0013)
THE FREEDOM OF LETTING THE KIDS CHOOSE IS ALSO A VERY IMPORTANT PART MHM MHM RIGHT  (fe_03_08225-A-0014)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08225-A-0015)
RIGHT I I THINK THAT'S WHY I WOULD GO AS WELL BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT  (fe_03_08225-A-0016)
THAT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT [COUGH]  (fe_03_08225-A-0017)
THAT THEY HAVE SOME  (fe_03_08225-A-0018)
ABILITY TO  (fe_03_08225-A-0019)
TO THINK ON THEIR OWN AND I THINK THE TEACHERS HAVE SUCH AN INFLUENCE ON WHAT THE  (fe_03_08225-A-0020)
THE FEELING OF THE KIDS  (fe_03_08225-A-0021)
COMES OUT  (fe_03_08225-A-0022)
EVEN IN THE BOOKS THAT THEY READ THAT THAT UM I I THINK I WOULD TAKE THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD AS WELL  (fe_03_08225-A-0023)
MM  (fe_03_08225-A-0024)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08225-A-0026)
BUT  (fe_03_08225-A-0027)
NO I WAS GOING TO SAY BUT THEN HOW MUCH OF THAT FALLS BACK ON THE PARENTS VERSUS THE SCHOOL  (fe_03_08225-A-0028)
RIGHT NO DEFINITELY  (fe_03_08225-A-0029)
RIGHT THAT'S VERY TRUE  (fe_03_08225-A-0030)
VERY VERY TRUE  (fe_03_08225-A-0031)
WHAT ABOUT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL WHAT DO YOU THINK ON THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL WE'VE BEEN TALKING ON THE ELEMENTARY AND  (fe_03_08225-A-0033)
UH JUST AS A  (fe_03_08225-A-0034)
MHM  (fe_03_08225-A-0036)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08225-A-0037)
THEY'RE ON THEIR OWN  (fe_03_08225-A-0039)
RIGHT THAT'S VERY TRUE THAT'S VERY TRUE  (fe_03_08225-A-0040)
I I AGREE I THINK THEY NEED TO BE EXPOSED TO DIVERSITY AND IN AS MUCH AS THEY CAN BE AND AND HOPEFULLY HELPING THEM MAKE THE  (fe_03_08225-A-0041)
THE  (fe_03_08225-A-0042)
DETERMINATIONS OR UH LEADING THEM DOWN THE RIGHT PATH  (fe_03_08225-A-0043)
THAT UM  (fe_03_08225-A-0044)
[LIPSMACK] BUT UH AS FAR AS CENSORING ANYTHING I I THINK THAT AT THAT POINT IT'S  (fe_03_08225-A-0045)
[SIGH] THERE'S PROS AND CONS AGAIN TO THAT [SIGH] UM  (fe_03_08225-A-0046)
BY GIVING THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO  (fe_03_08225-A-0047)
TO  (fe_03_08225-A-0048)
THE NEGATIVE OR WHAT WE WOULD CONSIDER THE NEGATIVITIES IT'S HELPING THEM MAKE THE CHOICE TO GO TO THE RIGHT  (fe_03_08225-A-0049)
PATH HOPEFULLY BUT THEN ON THE OTHER HAND IT'S  (fe_03_08225-A-0050)
I GUESS THEY'RE GOING TO LEARN IT SOME PLACE  (fe_03_08225-A-0051)
RIGHT OH YEAH  (fe_03_08225-A-0053)
RIGHT YEAH YES THAT'S TRUE [LIPSMACK]  (fe_03_08225-A-0055)
RIGHT THAT THAT'S THAT'S VERY TRUE I WONDER SOMETIMES UM NOW MUCH OF THAT IS IS THE FACT THAT THE KIDS ARE BEING PUSHED TO LEARN  (fe_03_08225-A-0056)
SO MUCH INFORMATION SO MUCH YOUNGER  (fe_03_08225-A-0057)
UM  (fe_03_08225-A-0058)
YOU KNOW IN THAT [MN]  (fe_03_08225-A-0059)
THE [SIGH] [MN] IT IN EVOLUTION AND PROGRESSION THEY HAVE TO HAVE UM THINGS HAVE TO  (fe_03_08225-A-0060)
GO ALONG BUT IT JUST SEEMS LIKE IN SOME CASES WHEN THEY GO TO SCHOOL AND HAVE TO BE ABLE TO READ WRITE AND THEY'RE DOING MULTIPLICATION BY FIRST GRADE  (fe_03_08225-A-0061)
UM  (fe_03_08225-A-0062)
WHERE YOU USED TO YOU KNOW IT'S THAT OLD ADAGE YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS A KID TYPE THING BUT  (fe_03_08225-A-0063)
Y- HOW MUCH OF IT IN IN  (fe_03_08225-A-0064)
MAYBE THAT'S WHERE THE CENSORSHIP IS GOOD IS IN THE YOUNGER GRADES  (fe_03_08225-A-0065)
UM RIGHT OH ABSOLUTELY  (fe_03_08225-A-0066)

UM I I I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE I'M CLEAR ON THAT IT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT UH  (fe_03_08225-B-0005)
REGULATING WHAT STUDENTS READ IS THAT RIGHT  (fe_03_08225-B-0006)
OKAY  (fe_03_08225-B-0007)
YEAH I I I AGREE I I UH THINK THAT UM  (fe_03_08225-B-0009)
[LIPSMACK] IT IT IS UM IMPORTANT UH TO CENSOR UH THE INFORMATION THAT SOME UM ESPECIALLY UM ELEMENTARY STUDENTS READ BECAUSE  (fe_03_08225-B-0010)
UM  (fe_03_08225-B-0011)
P- PARENTS SOMETIMES FEEL THAT YOU KNOW THEY DON'T WANT THEIR CHILD EXPOSED TO UH FOR EXAMPLE HOMOSEXUALITY OR ISSUES RELATED TO SEX  (fe_03_08225-B-0013)
AND UM IF YOU WANT TO RAISE YOUR CHILD IN THAT MA- MATTER YOU SHOULD HAVE UH THE RIGHT TO THAT  (fe_03_08225-B-0014)
YET AT THE SAME TIME UM  (fe_03_08225-B-0015)
I WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED BECAUSE  (fe_03_08225-B-0016)
UM  (fe_03_08225-B-0017)
[LIPSMACK] THE F- THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH ACT [MN]  (fe_03_08225-B-0018)
THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET AT UM IT'S IMPORTANT T- FOR UM  (fe_03_08225-B-0019)
PEOPLE 'SPECIALLY PEOPLE IN THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM TO UM BE EXPOSED TO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS UM IN ORDER I THINK AT LEAST TO BECOME INDEPENDENT THINKERS TO MAKE DECISIONS ON THEIR OWN  (fe_03_08225-B-0020)
UM SO IT I I WOULD SAY I I DON'T FAVOR BOTH GROUNDS  (fe_03_08225-B-0021)
HEAVILY I I SORTA TAKE A A MIDDLE ROAD APPROACH RIGHT  (fe_03_08225-B-0022)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08225-B-0024)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08225-B-0025)
AND UM  (fe_03_08225-B-0026)
AS YOU WERE SAYING AGAIN THE W- W- TH- THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO TO TO UM I THINK THE UM [NOISE] BOTH ASPECTS ARE IMPORTANT ONE UH CENSORSHIP  (fe_03_08225-B-0028)
UM BECAUSE I KNOW WITH ESPECIALLY WITH UM ELEMENTARY AND JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS  (fe_03_08225-B-0029)
THERE'RE ISSUES OF VIOLENCE KIDS BRINGING GUNS  (fe_03_08225-B-0030)
AND UM  (fe_03_08225-B-0031)
[LIPSMACK] THE NEWS IS TALKING ABOUT THEY'RE BEING EXPOSED TO VIDEO GAMES AND MOVIES THAT ARE NOT [LAUGHTER] RIGHT FOR THEM SO SO DEFINITELY IN IN TERMS OF UH THE BOOKS THAT YOU ALLOW THEM TO READ PERHAPS  (fe_03_08225-B-0032)
M- UH DURING THAT PERIOD OF OF THEIR LIFE IT'S IMPORTANT TO UM  (fe_03_08225-B-0033)
FILTER THAT TYPE OF INFORMATION  (fe_03_08225-B-0034)
AND THEN GO AHEAD  (fe_03_08225-B-0035)
RIGHT THAT'S TRUE THAT'S TRUE  (fe_03_08225-B-0036)
AND I I DON'T THINK THE SCHOOL CAN DO IT ALL THAT'S THAT'S RIGHT UH THERE THERE PROBABLY F- JUST LIKE UH WORKING PEOPLE ABOUT FORTY HOURS A WEEK  (fe_03_08225-B-0037)
UM BUT UM THE REST OF THAT ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY HOURS SO THAT WE CAN [LAUGHTER] THEY CAN BE AT HOME AND WITH FRIENDS ELSEWHERE YEAH YEAH  (fe_03_08225-B-0038)
OH ON THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL YEAH [LIPSMACK]  (fe_03_08225-B-0039)
I I STILL THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO UH FILTER UM  (fe_03_08225-B-0040)
[LIPSMACK] NEGATIVE INFORMATION  (fe_03_08225-B-0041)
BUT ESPECIALLY AT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL RIGHT BEFORE COLLEGE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR A PERSON TO GET UM EXPOSED TO UM DIFFERENT CULTURES DIFFERENT UM  (fe_03_08225-B-0042)
WAYS OF THINKING ABOUT ISSUES UM AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN UM  (fe_03_08225-B-0043)
AN ADVOCATE OF UM AT THAT HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL  (fe_03_08225-B-0044)
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT UM STUDENTS HAVE UM GOOD DECISION MAKING CAP- CAPABILITIES BECAUSE  (fe_03_08225-B-0045)
LEGALLY [LAUGHTER] BY EIGHTEEN UM  (fe_03_08225-B-0046)
IRREGARDLESS OF ANYTHING ELSE THEY'RE CONSIDERED AN ADULT AND UM  (fe_03_08225-B-0047)
IN MY OPINION IT'S IMPORTANT TH- THAT THE ABILITY FOR THEM TO MAKE DECISIONS ON THEIR OWN TO BE EXPOSED TO DIFFERENT CULTURES  (fe_03_08225-B-0048)
UM IT'S VERY IMPORTANT AT THAT STAGE BECAUSE THEREAFTER THEY UM  (fe_03_08225-B-0049)
[LIPSMACK] BASICALLY I MEAN THE PARENTS ARE THERE BUT IF THEY DO ANYTHING WRONG [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW THEN THE LEGAL SYSTEM GETS INVOLVED  (fe_03_08225-B-0050)
THEY COULD BE FIXED THEY COULD BE EASILY BE FACING UH TWENTY YEARS TO LIFE YEAH YEAH  (fe_03_08225-B-0051)

UM  (fe_03_08225-B-0057)
PERSONALLY I  (fe_03_08225-B-0058)
I WOULD HATE FOR EXAMPLE FOR A LIBRARY IN IN IN A PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL OR JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL  (fe_03_08225-B-0059)
TO UM  (fe_03_08225-B-0060)
RESTRICT UH THE BOOKS THAT THE UH STUDENTS COULD READ TO TO A SPECIFIC TYPE  (fe_03_08225-B-0061)
BECAUSE UH I GUESS THAT THAT'S PART OF THE BEAUTY OF THE EDUCATION THAT UM  (fe_03_08225-B-0062)
AMERICA AFFORDS UH STUDENTS  (fe_03_08225-B-0063)
YET AT THE SAME TIME THOUGH UM IN TERMS OF UH CENSORSHIP UM  (fe_03_08225-B-0064)
[SIGH] THAT'S REALLY A TOUGH QUESTION UM WHERE DO YOU STOP WHAT DO YOU DO  (fe_03_08225-B-0065)
UM  (fe_03_08225-B-0066)

A SOCIALIZATION TEXT LET ME SAY IT THAT WAY HELP THEM  (fe_03_08225-B-0073)

STUDENTS ARE HAVING A A HARD TIME AT ADJUSTING WITH THEMSELVES OR COMING TO GRIPS WITH THEMSELVES SO UM [LIPSMACK]  (fe_03_08225-B-0081)
WHATEVER THE LITERATURE DOES UM IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL IF IT IT COULD HELP SOCIALIZE UH STUDENTS TO LEARN TO GET ALONG WITH ONE ANOTHER AND NOT ENGAGE IN UH SUCH BEHAVIOR  (fe_03_08225-B-0082)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08225-B-0084)
