THEY SAID BOTH  (fe_03_08205-A-0006)
WHICH IS A DIFFERENCE [LAUGHTER] BECAUSE  (fe_03_08205-A-0007)
I THINK PRIVATE SCHOOLS HAVE THE RIGHT TO  (fe_03_08205-A-0008)
HAVE MORE CONTROL THAN PUBLIC SCHOOLS  (fe_03_08205-A-0009)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08205-A-0010)
DO YOU THINK PUBLIC SCHOOLS SHOULD HAVE THOSE  (fe_03_08205-A-0011)

RIGHT  (fe_03_08205-A-0014)
NO ME EITHER [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08205-A-0015)
ALTHOUGH AS A PARENT I RESERVE THE RIGHT TO CENSOR WHAT MY KIDS READ  (fe_03_08205-A-0016)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08205-A-0017)
THAT SHOULD BE REMAIN MY OPTION  (fe_03_08205-A-0018)

AND I THOUGHT IT WAS COOL  (fe_03_08205-A-0030)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08205-A-0031)
WELL IN TALKING WITH THE LIBRARIAN AT OUR PUBLIC LIBRARY SHE SAID IT'S HARD FOR HER TO HAVE THESE BOOKS AVAILABLE BECAUSE THERE'S A VERY STRONG KIND OF RIGHT WING VERY CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIAN  (fe_03_08205-A-0032)
GROUP  (fe_03_08205-A-0033)
