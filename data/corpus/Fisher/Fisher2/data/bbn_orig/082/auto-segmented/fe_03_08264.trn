HI I'M VICKY AND I HAVEN'T DONE THIS BEFORE SO I'M REAL NEW AT THIS  (fe_03_08264-B-0001)
I I GUESS IT WAS CENSORSHIP IN SCHOOLS BUT IT SOUNDED LIKE I AM NOT SURE IF IT SAID THAT COULD THEY LIKE AVOID READING CERTAIN BOOKS OR SHOULD THEY OBLIGATE PEOPLE TO READ CERTAIN BOOKS I DIDN'T HEAR IT REAL CLEARLY  (fe_03_08264-B-0003)
WE COULD DO BOTH EITHER WAY  (fe_03_08264-B-0004)
[SIGH] FIRST OF ALL I GUESS THE FIRST QUESTION IS IS WHETHER YOU HAVE KIDS OR NOT 'CAUSE I GUESS THAT MIGHT MAKE [LAUGHTER] YOUR A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR OPINION ON ON BOOKS IN SCHOOL AND SUCH BUT  (fe_03_08264-B-0005)
OKAY  (fe_03_08264-B-0006)

[NOISE] [LIPSMACK] [MN] WHAT SORTS OF THINGS MIGHT YOU FIND OBJECTIONABLE  (fe_03_08264-B-0010)
RIGHT I MEAN CERTAINLY  (fe_03_08264-B-0012)
RIGHT I MEAN CERTAINLY AS FAR AS REQUIRED READING GOES I DON'T KNOW I BROUGHT UP I WAS BROUGHT UP WITH IT I ASSUME YOU WERE BROUGHT UP WITH IT TOO CERTAINLY ARE CERTAIN PIECES OF CLASSIC LITERATURE THAT ARE [SIGH] SORT OF CORE TEACHING  (fe_03_08264-B-0013)
PIECES I GUESS  (fe_03_08264-B-0014)
THAT I I THINK ARE PRETTY IMPORTANT I THINK THE REAL QUESTION REALLY HAS TO DO WITH MORE WITH WHETHER YOU KNOW HOW THE CRITICAL PROCESS OF THINKING ABOUT BOOKS  (fe_03_08264-B-0015)
IS THAN REALLY WHAT THE MATERIAL IS I THINK YOU CAN PROBABLY TEACH CRITICAL PROCESS  (fe_03_08264-B-0016)
YOU KNOW WHETHER YOU'RE PULLING SOME  (fe_03_08264-B-0017)
PIECE OF POP TRASH OUT OR WHETHER YOU'RE YOU KNOW PULLING SHAKESPEARE OUT OR WHATEVER IT IS IT'S REALLY A LOT MORE ABOUT [SIGH] CRITICAL THINKING THAN ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT THE NATURE OF THE MATERIAL IS  (fe_03_08264-B-0018)
RIGHT I WOULD THINK SO I WOULD THINK SO  (fe_03_08264-B-0019)
RIGHT I MEAN CERTAINLY IF IT COMES TO THE POINT WHERE WHERE [NOISE] THE REQUIRED READING IS GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE IT'S NOT ALLOWING YOU A LOT OF TIME TO READ ANYTHING ELSE THAT'S CERTAINLY A PROBLEM OR CERTAINLY IF IF  (fe_03_08264-B-0020)
YOU HAVE READING LISTS THAT ARE OBVIOUSLY PUSHING A CERTAIN YOU KNOW AGENDA OF SOME SORT  (fe_03_08264-B-0021)
I DON'T KNOW UM MAYBE THE QUESTION YOU THINK YOU HEARD AND I'M NOT SURE WHICH IT WAS IS MORE INTERESTING WHICH WAS MORE ABOUT ABOUT SORT OF CENSORSHIP OF  (fe_03_08264-B-0023)
BOOKS AND I'M NOT SURE HOW HARD YOU CENSOR THINGS EXCEPT I GUESS IF YOU PULLED THEM OUT OF THE LIBRARY SO WHATEVER  (fe_03_08264-B-0024)
SINCE THAT'S WHERE I GUESS A LOT OF THE [NOISE] KIDS DO ALTHOUGH I [NOISE] WOULD EXPECT MOST MOST KIDS SORT OF SUPPLEMENT WITH PUBLIC LIBRARIES SORT OF THING RATHER THAN JUST SCHOOL SYSTEM STUFF BUT  (fe_03_08264-B-0025)
YEAH  (fe_03_08264-B-0026)
I GUESS SO I MEAN I GUESS IT'S IT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION TO ME BECAUSE I DON'T EXPECT TO  (fe_03_08264-B-0027)
HAVE MY KIDS GET THEIR MAIN CHOICES OF WHAT THEY READ STRICTLY FROM THE SCHOOL SYSTEM  (fe_03_08264-B-0028)
SO I'M PROBABLY NOT NEARLY AS WORRIED ABOUT IT AS SOMEBODY WHO THINKS THAT BASICALLY ALL THEIR KID'S GONNA READ IS WHATEVER THE SCHOOL SYSTEM IS [LAUGHTER] THROWING AT THEM  (fe_03_08264-B-0029)
BUT  (fe_03_08264-B-0030)

[NOISE] I MEAN I'M I'M GENERALLY ANTI I'M GENERALLY ANTI CENSORSHIP BUT I'M NOT ACTUALLY YOU KNOW GENERALLY I THINK IN TERMS OF SCHOOL SYSTEMS MAKING CHOICES OF I MEAN CERTAINLY READING SPECIFIC TEXT NEEDS TO BE PART OF CURRICULA  (fe_03_08264-B-0033)

NOT PRIMARY BECAUSE TO YOU KNOW TO THAT INDIVIDUAL 'CAUSE IT'S PRIMARY TO CULTURE I MEAN FOR EXAMPLE I MEAN I'M NOT CHRISTIAN BUT I CAN UNDERSTAND MOST OF WESTERN LITERATURE A LOT BETTER FOR HAVING READ CHUNKS OF THE BIBLE  (fe_03_08264-B-0038)
