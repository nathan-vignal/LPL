UM HM YOU KNOW I THINK THAT'S WHAT I HAD TO GO THROUGH  (fe_03_08276-B-0005)
I DON'T RECALL AS A STUDENT EVER HAVING A CHOICE  (fe_03_08276-B-0006)
YEAH I UNLESS UM PERHAPS THEY'RE THINKING OF SHOULD TEACHER HAVE THE RIGHT TO FORM THEIR OWN CURRICULUM VERSUS IT BEING DICTATED TOP DOWN  (fe_03_08276-B-0007)
YEAH  (fe_03_08276-B-0008)
IT IT SEEMS LIKE I GUESS UM THE TOPIC BEING CENSORSHIP IT WOULD HAVE TO BE MORE LIKE A PROHIBITED SET RATHER THAN A  (fe_03_08276-B-0009)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08276-B-0010)
YEAH I IT COMES DIFFICULT OF COURSE IF IF UH  (fe_03_08276-B-0011)
THE WHOLE THEY CAN'T PARTICIPATE WITH THE REST OF THE CLASS OF COURSE THEY'RE OFF ON THEIR OWN  (fe_03_08276-B-0012)
AND UH  (fe_03_08276-B-0013)
OSTRACIZED PROBABLY [LAUGHTER] FROM THE REST OF THE KIDS  (fe_03_08276-B-0014)
BUT I I DON'T EVER RECALL BEING IN CLASS LIKE ONE EXAMPLE I RECALL WAS WHEN UM DO THE RIGHT THING CAME OUT THE MOVIE THE SPIKE LEE MOVIE  (fe_03_08276-B-0015)
I WAS TAKING  (fe_03_08276-B-0016)
IT WAS PRETTY HOTLY CONTESTED AND UM I WAS IN A RHETORIC CLASS AT THE TIME AND WE WOUND UP  (fe_03_08276-B-0017)
UM WATCHING THAT MOVIE AND YOU KNOW IT DIDN'T COUNT AS A BOOK OF COURSE BUT UM WATCHING BECAUSE IT WAS CONTROVERSIAL AND BANNED IN SOME CITIES  (fe_03_08276-B-0018)
AND I GUESS THAT UM  (fe_03_08276-B-0019)
THE PROCESS WAS ABOUT TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHY SOMEONE MIGHT WANT TO BAN IT  (fe_03_08276-B-0020)
SO UM IT'S IT'S LIKE UH I GUESS  (fe_03_08276-B-0021)
EXPOSURE OR CONFRONTING CENSORSHIP AS A TEACHING DEVICE ABOUT CENSORSHIP  (fe_03_08276-B-0022)
OKAY  (fe_03_08276-B-0023)
NO I I'VE ONLY HEARD OF IT  (fe_03_08276-B-0024)
[MN] YEAH I GUESS THEY CAN  (fe_03_08276-B-0025)
THEY COULD UH FAKE THEIR ARGUMENT BY CLAIMING THAT IT HAS NO LITERARY MERIT  (fe_03_08276-B-0026)
AS OPPOSED TO THINKING THAT THE IDEAS ARE SIMPLY TOO CONFRONTATIONAL OR CONTROVERSIAL  (fe_03_08276-B-0027)
UH LOTS OF WAYS I GUESS TO TO GET THERE IT WOULD COME DOWN TO  (fe_03_08276-B-0028)
PROVING YOUR REASONS WHY YOU WOULDN'T LET THE KIDS READ THE BOOK  (fe_03_08276-B-0029)
BUT UH  (fe_03_08276-B-0030)
YEAH IT IT JUST SOUNDS LIKE A A STRANGE PROMPTING I MAYBE I HAVEN'T BEEN FOLLOWING THE NEWS ENOUGH TO KNOW FROM WHAT THIS ARISES  (fe_03_08276-B-0031)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08276-B-0032)
I SEE  (fe_03_08276-B-0033)
YEAH I MEAN THAT'S AND THAT'S THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF PLENTY OF PARENTS ENDORSING THOSE BOOKS BECAUSE IT MAKES KIDS WANT TO READ  (fe_03_08276-B-0034)
SO TO THINK THAT IF IT'S ALSO LACED WITH DIFFICULT CONTENT THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL QUANDARY  (fe_03_08276-B-0035)
BECAUSE THEN YOU HAVE TO FORCE KIDS EARLIER ON TO TO SEE THAT SOME BOOKS ARE OKAY AND SOME AREN'T  (fe_03_08276-B-0036)
WELL AND ALSO THERE'S THE UH COOKIE JAR PROBLEM OF UM OF THE BOOKS THAT ARE FORBIDDEN BASICALLY BECOME THE DESIRED READING LIST  (fe_03_08276-B-0038)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08276-B-0039)
AND THE BIBLE WOULD GO IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION IN THAT CASE  (fe_03_08276-B-0040)
THEY'LL GO SOMEWHERE ELSE FAST  (fe_03_08276-B-0041)
[LAUGHTER] IT'S LIKE THE WHOLE MOVIE RATING SYSTEM SEEMS TO WORK THAT WAY  (fe_03_08276-B-0042)
MUST BE SOMETHING IN THERE THAT I'M GONNA LEARN FROM  (fe_03_08276-B-0044)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08276-B-0045)
I RECALL I MEAN THERE WAS PLENTY OF R. RATED MOVIES THAT THAT MY DAD USED TO KEEP US FROM WATCHING THAT HE USED HE LOVED WATCHING THEM AND THEY WERE THEY WERE BASICALLY HORROR MOVIES  (fe_03_08276-B-0046)
AND IT TOOK US A LONG TIME TO FIGURE OUT  (fe_03_08276-B-0047)
WHAT EXACTLY WAS HIS CRITERIA FOR FILTERING THESE THINGS IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE IT WAS NECESSARILY SEX  (fe_03_08276-B-0048)
UM YOU KNOW THE THE R. RATING WAS PERHAPS TOO BROAD TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GUIDING HIM  (fe_03_08276-B-0049)
A LOT OF TIMES I THINK IT WAS JUST UM WHAT HE HAD HEARD ABOUT A MOVIE HE DECIDED HE DIDN'T WANT US TO SEE BUT HE LIKED TO SEE  (fe_03_08276-B-0050)
SO WE HAD TO COME BACK LATER IN LIFE AND RENT THOSE MOVIES [LAUGHTER] SOMETIMES REALIZING WE HADN'T MISSED ANYTHING  (fe_03_08276-B-0051)
EXACTLY THAT'S  (fe_03_08276-B-0052)
THAT WAS A THAT WAS A SPECIFIC ENTRY ON THE LIST  (fe_03_08276-B-0053)
SO I WENT OVER TO MY FRIEND'S HOUSE TO WATCH IT [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08276-B-0054)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08276-B-0055)
[LAUGHTER] YEAH IT SOUNDS LIKE UH WE MUST HAVE BEEN ABOUT THE RIGHT AGE AT THE SAME TIME  (fe_03_08276-B-0056)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08276-B-0057)
NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE  (fe_03_08276-B-0058)
OKAY  (fe_03_08276-B-0059)
CLOSE ENOUGH  (fe_03_08276-B-0060)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08276-B-0061)
OH LIKE AN ALBUM UM  (fe_03_08276-B-0062)
YOU KNOW I THINK I THINK I'VE BOUGHT THEM BUT I'VE NEVER BEEN CARDED OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT  (fe_03_08276-B-0063)
I NO I MEAN I I THINK THAT AND I ALSO CAN'T FIGURE OUT WELL HOW MUCH LANG- IS IT LANGUAGE OR THEMES THAT IT TAKES TO GET ONE OF THOSE STICKERS  (fe_03_08276-B-0064)
BECAUSE SO MANY SO MANY ALBUMS YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND THE LYRICS ANYWAY  (fe_03_08276-B-0065)
[LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08276-B-0066)
RIGHT YEAH I MEAN AS FAR AS LEARNING FROM THAT I I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT UM  (fe_03_08276-B-0067)
WELL I MEAN I'VE I'VE BEEN BUYING MUSIC ALL MY LIFE IT'S STILL I DON'T THINK THAT I EVER  (fe_03_08276-B-0068)
LEARNED ANYTHING VICIOUS OR ELICIT BY WAY OF A SONG  (fe_03_08276-B-0069)
SO IT'S IT'S VERY SURPRISING THAT THEY'VE CARRIED IT OVER THERE  (fe_03_08276-B-0070)
AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW YOU CAN TURN ON THE RADIO USUALLY AND HEAR THE SONGS ANYWAY  (fe_03_08276-B-0071)
IF THEY'RE THEY'RE MUCH DESIRED  (fe_03_08276-B-0072)
BUT YEAH THAT'S THAT'S A PROBLEM TOO WHERE I GUESS SOME ARTISTS  (fe_03_08276-B-0073)
STRIVE TO GET THOSE LABELS PUT ON THEIR ALBUMS  (fe_03_08276-B-0074)
AND OTHERS ARE ARE EFFECTIVELY DAMNED BY IT  (fe_03_08276-B-0075)
DEPENDING ON WHAT THEIR TARGET MARKET IS  (fe_03_08276-B-0076)
YES  (fe_03_08276-B-0077)
ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY CREATE THE ILLUSION THAT THERE'S TWO VERSIONS OF AN ALBUM [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08276-B-0078)
EXACTLY IT BECOMES TWICE AS VALUABLE  (fe_03_08276-B-0079)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08276-B-0080)
YEAH AND I MEAN IN IN NONE OF THIS NONE OF THIS DO I EVER SEE WHERE THE PERSON BEING PROTECTED WANTS PROTECTION  (fe_03_08276-B-0081)
SO I I MEAN YOU'RE A PARENT I GATHER YOU MENTION YOU HAVE KIDS  (fe_03_08276-B-0082)
I'M NOT YET BUT UM I WOULD IMAGINE THAT YOU YOU'VE ESTABLISHED SOME UH TIMING WHERE THERE'S THINGS YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO KNOW YET  (fe_03_08276-B-0083)
MHM  (fe_03_08276-B-0084)
YEAH I DON'T I DON'T THINK I DON'T RECALL CURRICULUM ALLOWING ONE TO WONDER THROUGH BOOKS REALLY UNTIL MAYBE ABOUT FIFTH OR  (fe_03_08276-B-0085)
