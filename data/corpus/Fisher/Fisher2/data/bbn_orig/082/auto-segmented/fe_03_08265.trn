OH OKAY YEAH WELL THAT'S THAT'S AN EASY ONE FOR ME I DON'T THINK THAT THEY CAN REQUIRE  (fe_03_08265-A-0003)
UM YOU KNOW A STUDENT TO READ A BOOK IF THE PARENTS OBJECT TO IT  (fe_03_08265-A-0004)
UM MY MY MY FAMILY WE'RE WE'RE STRONG CHRISTIANS AND THERE ARE SOME OF THE BOOKS THAT WE OBJECT TO  (fe_03_08265-A-0005)

EXACTLY  (fe_03_08265-A-0012)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08265-A-0013)
YOU KNOW I CAN SEE HAVING A RECOMMENDED READING LIST AND THAT'S FINE YOU KNOW WE RECOMMEND THAT THE KIDS SHOULD READ THIS WE RECOMMEND THIS BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S GOT LITERARY VALUE AND AND THAT'S FINE TO RECOMMEND UM BUT AS FAR AS REQUIRED UM  (fe_03_08265-A-0014)
EVEN TO SAY IT'S A REQUIRED READING LIST WOULD BE FINE AS LONG AS IT'S UNDERSTOOD THAT THE PARENTS HAVE THE RIGHT TO SAY NO I DON'T WANT THEM READING THIS ONE OR I OBJECT TO THIS BOOK UH WE HAD MY OLDEST SON WHEN HE WAS IN THE SEVENTH GRADE THEY WERE READING SOMETHING THAT UH  (fe_03_08265-A-0015)
I HAD NOT SEEN  (fe_03_08265-A-0016)
AND AND IT SEEMED PRETTY HARMLESS BUT  (fe_03_08265-A-0017)
HE OBJECTED TO IT IT WAS A BOOK ABOUT THE CIVIL WAR AND IT WASN'T UM IT WASN'T A HISTORICAL BOOK YOU KNOW IT WAS SOMEBODY TAKING QUITE A BIT OF LICENCE WITH THE THE STORY AND CREATED A STORY AND AH THEY WERE S- THEY SAID THAT THEY WERE SETTING IT UP TO  (fe_03_08265-A-0018)
AH LET THE KIDS KNOW WHAT LIFE WAS REALLY LIKE  (fe_03_08265-A-0019)
UM AND THEY STARTED READING IT IN CLASS EVERY DAY A LITTLE BIT AND THEY CAME ACROSS SEVERAL CURSE WORDS AND H- THE TEACHER SAID OF COURSE THAT THEY WOULDN'T NORMALLY TALK THIS WAY IN SCHOOL [NOISE] BUT THESE WERE THE WORDS FROM THE BOOK AND THEY'RE ONLY QUOTING THE BOOK AND AFTER ALL THEY DID TALK LIKE THIS  (fe_03_08265-A-0020)
AND MY SON CAME HOME AND HE SAID MOM I I ASKED HER IF I COULD LEAVE THE CLASSROOM BECAUSE YOU KNOW I DON'T LIKE THOSE WORDS AND WE DON'T TALK LIKE THAT AND I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THOSE WORDS AND SHE SAID THAT THAT WAS OKAY AND SHE LET ME GO IN THE LIBRARY  (fe_03_08265-A-0021)
AND CHOOSE SOMETHING ELSE AND SO EACH DAY WHEN THEY WOULD READ HE WOULD JUST LEAVE GO TO THE LIBRARY AND READ ON HIS BOOKS AND HE WOULD BE TESTED ON THAT AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS GREAT YOU KNOW BUT SOME TEACHERS I'M SURE WOULD PUSH IT A LITTLE FURTHER  (fe_03_08265-A-0022)
SO I DIDN'T OBJECT TO THE CONTENT OF THE BOOK BUT I OBJ- YOU KNOW AS HE OBJECTED TO THE LANGUAGE CERTAINLY I'M NOT GOING TO TELL MY SON NO YOU MUST LISTEN TO THE CURSE WORDS [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW AND I DON'T WANT THE SCHOOL SAYING THAT EITHER  (fe_03_08265-A-0023)
AH WHEN THEY'RE TE- TEACHING UH SUBJECTS YOU KNOW I I HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS THAT REALLY ENJOY THE HARRY POTTER SERIES I PERSONALLY DON'T LIKE IT  (fe_03_08265-A-0024)

I JUST DON'T SEE THE REASON FOR IT  (fe_03_08265-A-0027)
BOOKS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE CREATING A LOVE FOR READING AND A LOVE FOR LEARNING  (fe_03_08265-A-0028)
UM BUT IF YOU'RE FORCING FAMILIES INTO BOOKS THAT THEY DON'T WANT I DON'T THINK THAT'S GONNA HELP THE KIDS YOU KNOW GET A A LOVE FOR READING  (fe_03_08265-A-0029)
SO I'M I'M AGAINST THAT  (fe_03_08265-A-0030)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08265-A-0031)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08265-A-0032)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08265-A-0033)
YEAH  (fe_03_08265-A-0034)
WELL YOU KNOW THEY SLIP IT IN THERE UM AND IT SEEMS HARMLESS [MN] AT FIRST BUT KIDS DON'T REALLY QUESTION WHAT THEY'RE READING THEY'RE JUST READING IT  (fe_03_08265-A-0035)
AND OF COURSE IT'S JUST LIKE COMMERCIALS IT ALL GOES INTO THEIR LITTLE HEAD [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW INTO THAT LITTLE HEAD OF THEIRS AND AND IT MUDDLES AROUND AND AFTER A WHILE THEY'RE BEGGING FOR THIS PARTICULAR CEREAL NOT BECAUSE THEY THINK THE CEREAL WILL BE GOOD BECAUSE OF THE PRIZES IN IT  (fe_03_08265-A-0036)
A- AND I THINK IT'S THE SAME THING WITH BOOKS UM THEY SLIP YOU KNOW WHEN I SAY THEY THAT SOUNDS SO PARANOID BUT THE WORLD IN A SENSE REALLY IS DETERMINED TO UM  (fe_03_08265-A-0037)
CHANGE THE THOUGHTS OF PEOPLE AND AND MAKE 'EM BE YOU KNOW THE WORD TOLERANT THEY LOVE THE WORD 'TOLERANT'  (fe_03_08265-A-0038)
AND THEY SEEM TO BE TOLERANT OF EVERYONE BUT CHRISTIANS  (fe_03_08265-A-0039)
SO THEY PUT THEIR VIEWS INTO THE BOOKS  (fe_03_08265-A-0040)
AND UH I DON'T KNOW I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT AND AND LIKE I SAID I DON'T MIND A RECOMMENDED READING LIST AT ALL  (fe_03_08265-A-0041)
BUT I'M TOTALLY AGAINST SAYING THAT YOU HAVE TO YOU'RE GONNA GRADE MY CHILD AND SAY THAT HE'S NOT A GOOD READER OR THAT HE'S NOT ABLE TO COMPREHEND A CERTAIN GRADE LEVEL BECAUSE HE DIDN'T READ THE PARTICULAR BOOK YOU CHOSE  (fe_03_08265-A-0042)
YOU KNOW HE MAY BE YOU KNOW PERFECTLY WELL ABLE TO READ AT THAT LEVEL BUT TH- HE DOESN'T HAVE TO READ THAT BOOK TO PROVE IT AND I THINK SCHOOL IS SUPPOSED TO BE A PLACE WHERE THEY SH- YOU KNOW THEY LEARN TO READ AT A CERTAIN LEVEL IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A CERTAIN BOOK  (fe_03_08265-A-0043)
AND  (fe_03_08265-A-0044)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08265-A-0045)
THEY REALLY DO TREAT YOU LIKE OH MY GOODNESS YOU KNOW THE EYE ROLLING  (fe_03_08265-A-0047)
[LAUGHTER] WHEREAS SOON AS YOU KNOW THEY SAY THEY LIKE YOU SAID THEY THEY CLAIM TO WANT THE PARENTS INVOLVED  (fe_03_08265-A-0048)
BUT AS SOON AS THE PARENTS BECOME INVOLVED THEY BEGIN TO ROLL THE EYES [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW SO MY GOODNESS WHY DO YOU HAVE TO COME IN HERE AND SAY ALL THIS  (fe_03_08265-A-0049)
BUT YOU KNOW IT'S MY KID AND UH I DID HOME SCHOOL MY CHILDREN WHENEVER WE LIVED IN AN AREA THAT THAT WE DID NOT APPROVE OF THE SCHOOL SYSTEM WE HOME SCHOOLED  (fe_03_08265-A-0050)
AND AS A MATTER OF FACT THIS COMING UP YEAR IS GOING TO BE VERY STRANGE FOR ME 'CAUSE IT'LL BE THE FIRST YEAR  (fe_03_08265-A-0051)
THAT I I THINK THAT I ALL THE THREE OF MY KIDS HAVE BEEN IN PUBLIC SCHOOL AT THE SAME TIME [LAUGHTER] AND I'VE GOT ONE THAT'S GOING TO THE TENTH GRADE AND YOU KNOW SO I'VE GOT A HIGH SCHOOL A MIDDLE SCHOOL AND ELEMENTARY SCHOOL  (fe_03_08265-A-0052)
AND THIS WILL BE THE FIRST TIME ALL OF THEM HAVE BEEN IN IN HI- IN SCHOOL AT THE SAME TIME BUT UM  (fe_03_08265-A-0053)
IT JUST DEPENDS YOU KNOW AND IF AS SOON AS I START HAVING PROBLEMS WITH A SCHOOL TO WHERE THEY'RE FORCING MY CHILD INTO HARRY POTTER BECAUSE IT'S REQUIRED NOW [SIGH] YOU KNOW I'M GONNA HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT  (fe_03_08265-A-0054)
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO HAVE HARRY POTTER PARTICULARLY OR THIS BOOK PARTICULARLY OR THAT BOOK TO BE ABLE TO SHOW WHETHER OR NOT MY CHILD CAN READ  (fe_03_08265-A-0055)
SO THAT'S YEAH THAT'S MY PROBLEM WITH IT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY CENSORSHIP SO MUCH AS IT IS UM  (fe_03_08265-A-0056)
PERSONAL CHOICE  (fe_03_08265-A-0057)
AND YOU KNOW UH WE WHEN I WAS A KID THEY USED TO READ THE UH LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE BOOKS  (fe_03_08265-A-0058)
AND I LOVE THOSE BUT CERTAINLY IF SOMEONE FOR SOME REASON FOUND THAT OBJECTIONABLE TO THEIR FAMILY THEN I ALSO WOULDN'T SAY THAT YOU SHOULD FORCE THEM TO READ IT  (fe_03_08265-A-0059)
SO I THINK YOU KNOW THEY TALK ABOUT CHOICE THEY WANT EVERYBODY TO HAVE A CHOICE AND FREEDOM AND BE TOLERANT BUT THEY'RE NOT TOLERANT OF THAT KIND OF THING  (fe_03_08265-A-0060)
AND I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT EVERYONE'S SUPPOSED TO BE UNCENSORED EXCEPT CHRISTIANS AND THEY WANT US TO BE CENSORED AND I DON'T LIKE THAT  (fe_03_08265-A-0061)
ITS' J- YOU KNOW THE STOMPING OF THE FEET IT'S JUST NOT FAIR [LAUGHTER] POKING OUT YOUR BOTTOM LIP IT'S NOT RIGHT [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08265-A-0062)

CAN'T AH CONTROL WHAT MY CHILD READS AT HOME  (fe_03_08265-A-0067)
UM AS FAR AS READING LISTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO YOU KNOW AS LONG AS THEY SAY WE'RE NOT GOING TO PUT THIS PARTICULAR BOOK ON THE READING LIST THAT'S FINE AS LONG AS I'M NOT FORCED TO THE ONES THAT THEY'VE CHOSEN ALSO  (fe_03_08265-A-0068)
UM [NOISE] I DON'T THINK THEY'LL EVER PUT THE BIBLE ON THE PREFERRED READING LIST [LAUGHTER] BUT I CAN'T F- I CAN'T EVEN THINK OF A BOOK THAT'S GOT MORE OF EVERYTHING YOU'VE EVER WANTED IN A BOOK  (fe_03_08265-A-0069)
