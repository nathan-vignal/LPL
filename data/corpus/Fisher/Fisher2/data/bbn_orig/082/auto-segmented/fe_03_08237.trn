AND I THINK AS LONG AS THEY'RE NOT OF A RELIGIOUS YOU KNOW NATURE  (fe_03_08237-B-0012)
UM AND THEY'RE NOT KIND OF GOVERNMENT PROPAGANDA I THINK THAT YOU KNOW I UH I THINK THAT THAT THERE ARE BOOKS THAT SHOULD BE REQUIRED CERTAIN BOOKS THAT SHOULD THAT GIVE THEM A A YOU KNOW CERTAIN  (fe_03_08237-B-0013)
UH A BASIC IN IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND UH AND HISTORY OF THE CO- OR OUR COUNTRY  (fe_03_08237-B-0014)
YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE THAT THAT THAT THAT THEY DO NEED FOR EVERYDAY FUNCTIONING  (fe_03_08237-B-0015)
I THINK THAT I THINK THOSE SHOULD BE REQUIRED  (fe_03_08237-B-0016)
THAT'S RIGHT  (fe_03_08237-B-0017)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08237-B-0018)
WELL YOU KNOW IT'S INTERESTING THAT THE SUBJECT IS CENSORSHIP WHICH IS THE OPPOSITE YOU KNOW IT'S I FELT THAT THE QUESTION WOULD BE MORE IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY CAN'T READ  (fe_03_08237-B-0019)
AND THIS THIS IS NOT THE QUESTION THE QUESTION IS WHAT THEY HAVE TO READ  (fe_03_08237-B-0020)
MHM  (fe_03_08237-B-0021)
THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S HOW YOU I MEAN THAT IS HOW YOU LEARN THROUGH THE WRITTEN WORD WHEN YOU'RE VERY YOUNG  (fe_03_08237-B-0022)
AND THROUGH YOUR EXPOSURE TO YOUR FAMILY AND TO FRIENDS AND PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GO AND TAKE OFF LIKE YOU SAID YOU CAN'T JUST GO AND TRAVEL SO  (fe_03_08237-B-0023)
NOW SO IF THERE ARE CERTAIN BOOKS THAT YOU ARE REQUIRED TO READ  (fe_03_08237-B-0024)

MHM  (fe_03_08237-B-0029)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08237-B-0030)
THIS THE ONLY THING I WOULD ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION IS I YOU KNOW I I DON'T THINK IT'S NOT A YES OR NO  (fe_03_08237-B-0032)
I THINK IT'S THE ANSWER IS VERY CONDITIONAL DEPENDING ON WHAT BOOK IF YOU KNOW WHEN THEY ASKED DO YOU THINK THAT SO AND SO HAS THE RIGHT TO MAKE  (fe_03_08237-B-0033)
CHILDREN READ CERTAIN BOOKS I THINK THE ANS- TO ME THE ANSWER IS  (fe_03_08237-B-0034)
UH YES DEPENDING ON WHAT THE BOOKS ARE  (fe_03_08237-B-0035)
YOU KNOW I'M NOT GOING TO SAY YES OR NO I'M GONG TO SAY WELL I'M GOING TO SAY YES  (fe_03_08237-B-0036)
BUT IT DEPENDS ON WHAT THE BOOKS ARE AND BEFORE I SAY YES I WANT TO KNOW WHAT THEY ARE  (fe_03_08237-B-0037)
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT  (fe_03_08237-B-0038)
AND SOMETIMES THERE'S TOO CH- YOU KNOW AT CERTAIN AGES THEY'RE TOO YOUNG TO UNDERSTAND AND THEY'RE FRIGHTENING THEY'RE SCARY WHERE IN A COUPLE OF YEARS WE'RE A LITTLE OLDER THEY MIGHT UNDERSTAND THE APPLICATION OF THE BOOK  (fe_03_08237-B-0039)
SO UM YOU KNOW IN HISTORY THERE'S SO MANY THINGS THAT WERE VERY WOULD BE VERY FRIGHTENING TO SOMEONE WHO'S S- SEVEN YEARS OLD BUT WHEN THEY'RE TWELVE THEY MAY ONCE YOU KNOW THEY'VE ALREADY STUDIED IT  (fe_03_08237-B-0040)
THEY AND AND AND BEEN IT'S BEEN EXPLAINED TO THEM  (fe_03_08237-B-0041)
EVEN THOUGH IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A TERRIBLE THING THAT WAS DONE  (fe_03_08237-B-0042)
THEY ALREADY THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS BEHIND IT  (fe_03_08237-B-0043)
THAT'S WHY I COULDN'T REMEMBER THE QUESTION  (fe_03_08237-B-0044)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08237-B-0045)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_08237-B-0046)

SO I CALLED BACK AND I GOT THEM IMMEDIATELY AND THEY SAID THE SUBJECT IS CENSORSHIP SO I SAT HERE THINKING  (fe_03_08237-B-0050)
ABOUT IT AND THEN WHEN THE QUESTION CAME ON I GUESS I WAS STILL THINKING ABOUT IT SO I DIDN'T REALLY  (fe_03_08237-B-0051)
UH PAY ATTENTION  (fe_03_08237-B-0052)
SO I WHEN THEY SAID SOMETHING OR PAROCHIAL SCHOOL  (fe_03_08237-B-0053)
AND  (fe_03_08237-B-0054)
MY MIND WENT D- SOMETHING TO PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS IT WAS TOO MANY THINGS IN THE QUESTION  (fe_03_08237-B-0055)
I DON'T KNOW MAYBE THEY SAID PUBLIC OR PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS I REALLY DON'T KNOW  (fe_03_08237-B-0056)

AND THAT THEY WERE GOING TO ASK IF I WAS USING A HANDSET AND I HAD WALKED AWAY FROM THE PHONE I HAVE MY LONG CORD ON IT  (fe_03_08237-B-0061)
AND THEN I HAD TO GO BACK I WAS SITTING COMFORTABLY IN FRONT OF MY COMPUTER LOOKING AT THE SCREEN SO OH HOLD IT OH I HAVE TO DO THIS AND I HAVE TO DO THAT  (fe_03_08237-B-0062)
