BY WHOMEVER OR WHATEVER ENTITY IS GOING TO BE CENSORING IT  (fe_03_08254-A-0070)
SO I THINK WE BOTH AGREE [LAUGHTER] THAT WE SHOULDN'T HAVE THIS IN THE SCHOOLS [NOISE]  (fe_03_08254-A-0071)
NOT A GOOD THING  (fe_03_08254-A-0072)
BECAUSE THEN YOU I MEAN IF YOU OPEN THAT DOOR IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE YOU'RE EVEN OPENING IT TO  (fe_03_08254-A-0073)

AND OF COURSE ANOTHER OPTION IS IF [MN] YOU KNOW THE CENSORSHIP DID TAKE PLACE AND YOU DON'T AGREE WITH IT IN OUR STATE WE HAVE  (fe_03_08254-A-0089)
OR IN MY COUNTY I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S STATE WIDE SCHOOL OF CHOICE YOU COULD JUST MOVE [LAUGHTER] TO ANOTHER SCHOOL  (fe_03_08254-A-0090)

[SIGH] AND PARENTS THAT'S ULTIMATELY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF PARENTS IF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE CHILDREN  (fe_03_08254-B-0036)
[SIGH] THEY NEED TO TAKE THAT RESPONSIBILITY  (fe_03_08254-B-0037)
MHM  (fe_03_08254-B-0038)
[SIGH] THE THING OF TH- OF THAT CENSORSHIP IS THAT IT'S IT'S ONE MORE ONE MORE FREEDOM THAT'S TAKEN AWAY  (fe_03_08254-B-0039)

[MN] TO FORBID THEIR THEIR CHILD TO READ A BOOK THAT THAT THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN  (fe_03_08254-B-0055)
WITHOUT THE CHILD BEING PENALIZED  (fe_03_08254-B-0056)

MHM  (fe_03_08254-B-0058)
HAVE YOU  (fe_03_08254-B-0059)

LEFT BEHIND AND AND THE SCHOOLS IN THE AFFLUENT NEIGHBORHOODS GET MORE FUNDING AND  (fe_03_08254-B-0070)
SO  (fe_03_08254-B-0071)

I I THINK THAT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE I REALLY DO [SIGH]  (fe_03_08254-B-0073)
MHM  (fe_03_08254-B-0074)
