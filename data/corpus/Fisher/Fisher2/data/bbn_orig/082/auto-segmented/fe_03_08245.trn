MAYBE OTHER PARENTS WANT THEIR CHILDREN TO YOU KNOW HAVE ACCESS TO THAT KIND OF THING I I DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD JUST LIMIT A BOOK JUST BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE DON'T LIKE IT  (fe_03_08245-A-0042)
I THINK IT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE AND YOU SHOULD TALK WITH YOUR OWN CHILD ABOUT IT NOT JUST WHAT TWO OR THREE PEOPLE SAY AND SAY WELL WE JUST WON'T HAVE IT FOR ANYONE 'CAUSE I DON'T I THINK THAT'S UNFAIR RIGHT THAT'S  (fe_03_08245-A-0043)
