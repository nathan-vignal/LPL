HI MY NAME'S SARAH  (fe_03_08241-A-0002)
HI KIM  (fe_03_08241-A-0003)
UM SO I GUESS WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE SPEAKING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT SCHOOLS HAVE A RIGHT TO LIMIT WHAT BOOKS KIDS CAN READ  (fe_03_08241-A-0004)
OKAY WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS  (fe_03_08241-A-0005)
MHM  (fe_03_08241-A-0006)
MHM  (fe_03_08241-A-0007)
I ALSO HAVE TO AGREE WITH YOU I ALSO READ YOU KNOW PRETTY QUICKLY AND PRETTY FAR IN ADVANCE OF THE OTHER KIDS MY AGE WHEN I WAS YOUNGER  (fe_03_08241-A-0008)
AND I WOULD HAVE BEEN HORRIFIED IF PEOPLE TRIED TO TELL ME WHAT I WAS ALLOWED TO READ AND WHAT I WASN'T ALLOWED TO READ UM I THINK THAT I ALSO DIDN'T HAVE ANY SORT OF UM  (fe_03_08241-A-0009)
BAD REPERCUSSIONS FROM IT AND YOU KNOW I I THINK THAT IF A PARENT ALLOWS A CHILD TO READ YOU KNOW WHATEVER THEY THINK IS APPROPRIATE SCHOOLS HAVE NO RIGHT TO INTERFERE WITH WHAT THEY UM WHAT THE PARENTS' CHOICE IS  (fe_03_08241-A-0010)
YEAH [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08241-A-0011)
I KNOW IT'S MY FIRST CALL ALSO [LAUGHTER] [MN]  (fe_03_08241-A-0012)
MHM  (fe_03_08241-A-0013)
[LAUGHTER] WELL I THINK THE ENTIRE I THINK THE ENTIRE PROBLEM IS IS THAT SOME PEOPLE DON'T FEEL THAT IDEAS HAVE A RIGHT TO BE EXPRESSED AND I THINK THAT THAT JUST GOES BACK TO THEIR INSECURITY ABOUT THE CORRECTNESS OF WHAT THEIR OPINION IS  (fe_03_08241-A-0014)
NEW YORK  (fe_03_08241-A-0015)
OH ARE YOU WOW  (fe_03_08241-A-0016)
OH THAT'S GREAT  (fe_03_08241-A-0017)
I MEAN I THINK I THINK POSSIBLY PART OF OUR PART OF WHY OUR OPINIONS ARE WHAT THEY ARE THOUGH HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT WE'RE BOTH FROM METROPOLITAN AREAS  (fe_03_08241-A-0018)
YOU KNOW I THINK THAT I THINK THAT THAT DEFINITELY AFFECTS UM AFFECTS THE THOUGHT PROCESS AND THE EXPERIENCES THAT WE'VE HAD  (fe_03_08241-A-0019)
OH OKAY  (fe_03_08241-A-0020)

MHM  (fe_03_08241-A-0029)
RIGHT I THINK IT'S A GREAT I THINK IT'S A GREAT SERIES OF BOOKS AND I THINK IT'S RIDICULOUS FOR PEOPLE TO TRY TO BECAUSE OF A A GENERAL OVER ARCHING UM CONCEPT IT'S JUST A VEHICLE OF THE BOOK IT'S NOT NECESSARILY SOME SORT OF UM MORAL STATEMENT THAT IT'S MAKING  (fe_03_08241-A-0030)
SO THE WHOLE SITUATION IS JUST SO RIDICULOUS ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S A WHEN IT'S A SERIES OF BOOKS THAT ARE GETTING KIDS WHO WOULDN'T OTHERWISE READ TO START READING  (fe_03_08241-A-0031)
MHM  (fe_03_08241-A-0032)
MHM  (fe_03_08241-A-0033)
AND IT'S SUCH A DIFFERENT EX- I'M SORRY  (fe_03_08241-A-0034)
RIGHT AND IT'S JUST IF IF ANY KIND OF BOOK WILL INTRODUCE SOMEONE TO BEING A READER  (fe_03_08241-A-0035)
THEN LATER ON YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'LL CATCH THEIR ATTENTION AND AND AGAIN OPEN THEM UP TO THAT EXPERIENCE  (fe_03_08241-A-0036)
BECAUSE IT'S JUST IT'S SUCH A DIFFERENT THING THAN WATCHING T._V. OR MOVIES OR EVEN EVEN APPRECIATING ART  (fe_03_08241-A-0037)

UM  (fe_03_08241-A-0062)
I GUESS TO PLAY DEVIL'S ADVOCATE ON IT SOME PEOPLE MIGHT FEEL THAT UM EXPOSING CHILDREN TO LITERATURE THAT THEY WEREN'T QUITE READY FOR MIGHT AFFECT THE WAY THEY WOULD THINK OF THINGS IN THE FUTURE  (fe_03_08241-A-0063)
AND PERHAPS GIVE THEM IDEAS THAT THEY WEREN'T CAPABLE OF HANDLING AT THAT POINT  (fe_03_08241-A-0064)
