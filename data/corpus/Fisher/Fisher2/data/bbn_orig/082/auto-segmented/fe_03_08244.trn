HI MY NAME'S C._J.  (fe_03_08244-A-0001)
IS THIS YOUR FIRST ONE OF THESE  (fe_03_08244-A-0003)
MINE TOO  (fe_03_08244-A-0004)
UM SO THE TOPIC IS UH CENSORSHIP IN THE SCHOOLS [LIPSMACK]  (fe_03_08244-A-0005)
WELL I THINK IT MIGHT DEPEND ON THE AGE OF THE STUDENT TOO I MEAN IF YOU'RE IN COLLEGE OR IN HIGH SCHOOL I THINK YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH TO KINDA HAVE BE ABLE TO TO READ SOMETHING AND AND GET THE GIST OF WHAT IT MEANS BUT  (fe_03_08244-A-0006)
WHEN THEY'RE YOUNGER IT'S KINDA JUST LIKE  (fe_03_08244-A-0007)
YOU KNOW LETTING YOUNG SCHOOL AGE KIDS ON THE COMPUTER THEY DO IT WITHOUT PARENTS LOOKING OVER THEIR SHOULDER  (fe_03_08244-A-0008)
SO I THINK PART OF IT IS IS BASED ON AGE  (fe_03_08244-A-0009)
OH YEAH  (fe_03_08244-A-0010)
YEAH I UNDER- UNDERSTAND THAT ESPECIALLY WITH HARRY POTTER EVERYBODY SAYING OH IT'S ABOUT WITCHCRAFT AND  (fe_03_08244-A-0011)
WIZARDRY AND THINGS LIKE THAT SHOULDN'T BE ABOUT BUT IT'S ALSO A WAY THAT A LOT OF KIDS NOW ARE REALLY REALLY WANTING TO READ AND I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING THAT IF THEY CENSOR THAT BOOK AND DON'T ALLOW IT INTO THE SCHOOLS  (fe_03_08244-A-0012)
AND YET IT'S A MOTIVATING FACTOR FOR KIDS TO START TO READ WHY WOULD YOU  (fe_03_08244-A-0013)
HOLD HOLD THAT BACK  (fe_03_08244-A-0014)
[LAUGHTER] NINE HUNDRED PAGES [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08244-A-0015)
THE THE LAST ONE SHE PUT OUT BOOK FIVE IS LIKE ALMOST NINE HUNDRED PAGES  (fe_03_08244-A-0016)
[LAUGHTER] NO I HAVEN'T READ IT YET I NEED TO START WITH THE FIRST BOOK BUT  (fe_03_08244-A-0017)
[MN] AND AND I THINK ALSO WHEN IT COMES TO THE CENSORSHIP IS WHOSE WHO LIKE YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE PARENTS HAVING THE RIGHT TO SAY NAY OR YAY I MEAN WHO  (fe_03_08244-A-0018)
ON THE UM BOARD OF EDUCATION HAS THE RIGHT TO SAY WELL I DON'T THINK UH YOU KNOW EACH KID SHOULD BE ABLE TO READ THAT BOOK IN OUR LIBRARY BECAUSE  (fe_03_08244-A-0019)
WHEREAS SOME KIDS AREN'T MATURE ENOUGH TO READ IT OTHER KIDS MIGHT BE MATURE ENOUGH TO READ IT AND REALLY GET THE GIST OF IT  (fe_03_08244-A-0020)
OR MAYBE THEY READ A BOOK AND THEY'RE REALLY TURNED ON BY IT AND THEN THEY TURN ANOTHER KID ON TO IT AND IT KINDA HAS THAT SNOWBALL EFFECT KINDA LIKE HARRY POTTER DOES LIKE THE MORE PEOPLE HEAR ABOUT IT THE MORE DIFFERENT PEOPLE WANTED TO READ IT  (fe_03_08244-A-0021)
AND IT AND IF YOUR GOAL ESPECIALLY IN SCHOOL IS TO HAVE KIDS L-  (fe_03_08244-A-0022)
LEARN TO READ AND DEVELOP THOSE SKILLS AND DEVELOP THOSE CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS IF YOU BAN BOOKS THAT ONE PERSON SAYS THESE ARE NOT GOOD THEN  (fe_03_08244-A-0023)
I- IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE YOU KNOW IT IT  (fe_03_08244-A-0024)
YEAH UH BECAUSE IT'S PERSONAL OPINION IT'S ALL PERSONAL OPINION  (fe_03_08244-A-0025)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08244-A-0026)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08244-A-0027)
YEAH IT DEVELOPS UM [LIPSMACK] HOW WOULD YOU PUT IT KINDA LIKE VALUES AND VIEWS THAT MAYBE YOU WOULD NORMALLY NOT HAVE DEVELOPED IF YOU HADN'T READ THAT SORT OF BOOK  (fe_03_08244-A-0028)
UH I THINK IT  (fe_03_08244-A-0029)
YEAH IT MAKES YOU UM  (fe_03_08244-A-0030)
[LIPSMACK] DEPENDING ON THE BOOK UH UH WHICH BOOK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BUT I I THINK IT ALLOWS YOU TO DEVELOP THAT THOUGHT PROCESS TO REALLY LOOK AT SOMETHING AND SAY [LIPSMACK] I REMEMBER READING ABOUT THIS  (fe_03_08244-A-0031)
AND THIS REMINDS ME  (fe_03_08244-A-0032)
[LAUGHTER] NOW IF YOU COULD ONLY AD- AND I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO UM PEOPLE  (fe_03_08244-A-0033)
PUTTING A A CENSORSHIP ON CERTAIN BOOKS  (fe_03_08244-A-0034)
HOW WE WERE TALKING ABOUT  (fe_03_08244-A-0035)
PARENTS HAVE A THAT THAT RIGHT MORE SO THAN SAY A BOARD OF EDUCATION BUT LET'S SAY A BOARD OF EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA 'CAUSE THAT'S WHERE I'M AT MIGHT BE A LOT MORE LIBERAL THAN A BOARD OF EDUCATION IN SOUTH CAROLINA  (fe_03_08244-A-0036)
AND WHERE THEY SAY OH NO THAT'S A TERRIBLE BOOK LIKE SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE IN THE SOUTH ARE THE ONES SAYING NO NO HARRY POTTER BAD STUFF SO IT'S REGIONAL AS WELL OOPS I'M GOING TO HAVE TO MOVE UM  (fe_03_08244-A-0037)
[LIPSMACK] SO IT IT IS IT'S VERY REGIONAL AS TO WHERE [NOISE] YOU GET THAT CENSORSHIP OR WHERE YOU DON'T GET THAT CENSORSHIP  (fe_03_08244-A-0038)
HOW MM HOW CAN I SAY IT LIBERAL [LAUGHTER] HOW LIBERAL AN AREA MIGHT BE  (fe_03_08244-A-0039)
OH YEAH  (fe_03_08244-A-0040)
OH YEAH AND  (fe_03_08244-A-0041)
YEAH [LAUGHTER] YEAH SO IT IS IT'S IT CAN BE REAL REGIONAL AS WELL  (fe_03_08244-A-0042)
RIGHT AND THE FUNNY THING IS I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO SAY NO THAT'S A BAD BOOK MAYBE HAVEN'T EVEN READ THE BOOK  (fe_03_08244-A-0043)
SO HOW DO THEY KNOW HAVE THEY READ PART OF IT OR SOMEONE SAID  (fe_03_08244-A-0044)
OH DID YOU READ PAGE FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY THREE AND DID YOU HEAR SEE THAT LANGUAGE IN THERE AND SO THEY'LL TURN TO PAGE FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY THREE READ IT AND SAY OH YES THIS IS A BAD BOOK BUT IT'S TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT  (fe_03_08244-A-0045)
OH NO  (fe_03_08244-A-0046)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08244-A-0047)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08244-A-0048)
[LAUGHTER] WELL [MN] LIKE I SAID WHEN IT COMES TO CENSORSHIP I I'M PRETTY SURE THERE ARE  (fe_03_08244-A-0049)
A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WOULD JUST LISTEN TO WHAT SOMEONE ELSE SAYS AND THEN SAY OH NO IT'S A BAD BOOK AND IF YOU ASK THEM DID YOU READ IT THEY'LL [LAUGHTER] IF THEY'RE HONEST THEY'LL SAY NO  (fe_03_08244-A-0050)
AND HOW CAN YOU MAKE THAT JUDGMENT HOW CAN YOU MAKE THAT JUDGMENT WHETHER OR NOT IT'S SOMETHING THAT SHOULD OR SHOULDN'T BE CENSORED IF YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO TO READ IT  (fe_03_08244-A-0051)
AND  (fe_03_08244-A-0052)
IN IT'S PERSPECTIVE TOO BECAUSE LIKE YOU WE WERE SAYING DEPENDING WHERE YOU LIVE YOU CAN READ SOMETHING AND SAY  (fe_03_08244-A-0053)
OH THAT'S YOU KNOW ANTI MORAL AND YET SOMEWHERE ELSE WHERE THEY'RE MORE LIBERAL THEY'LL SAY NO THAT'S THAT'S A GREAT BOOK THAT'S PART OF LIFE THAT'S HOW YOU LIVE LIFE  (fe_03_08244-A-0054)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08244-A-0055)
THAT'S RIGHT  (fe_03_08244-A-0057)
YEAH IT'S LIKE YOU APPRECIATE  (fe_03_08244-A-0058)
WHAT WHAT THEY'VE WRITTEN IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO AGREE WITH IT  (fe_03_08244-A-0059)
BUT YOU REALIZE THAT  (fe_03_08244-A-0060)
DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU GROW UP YOUR VIEWS ARE GOING TO BE DIFFERENT THAN SOMEONE ELSE WHO GREW UP IN A DIFFERENT AREA AND  (fe_03_08244-A-0061)

BUT UH I DON'T KNOW I MEAN IT'S THAT'S A ANOTHER THING IT'S UP TO THE PARENTS ALSO WHETHER THEY WANT THEIR CHIL- CHILD TO READ CERTAIN BOOKS OR NOT  (fe_03_08244-B-0015)
SO IF IF IT COMES DOWN TO IT AND THE SCHOOL REALLY BANS A BOOK AND THE CHILD JUST REALLY WANTS TO READ IT AND THE PARENTS THINK IT IT'S FINE [NOISE]  (fe_03_08244-B-0016)
