HELLO  (fe_03_08236-A-0001)
YES I'M HERE  (fe_03_08236-A-0002)
THE QUESTION WAS SHOULD PUBLIC OR PRIVATE SCHOOLS BE ABLE TO TO GOVERN WHAT BOOKS CHILDREN READ  (fe_03_08236-A-0003)
YES THAT'S TH- CAN THEY  (fe_03_08236-A-0004)
MY NAME IS GEORGIA LYN  (fe_03_08236-A-0005)
I'M IN PENNSYLVANIA  (fe_03_08236-A-0006)
NICE TALKING WITH YOU  (fe_03_08236-A-0007)
WELL I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO DECIDE IF THEY CAN IF THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO BAN CERTAIN BOOKS FROM THE CHILDREN BEING ABLE TO READ THEM  (fe_03_08236-A-0008)
AND I BELIEVE THAT DEPENDS ON THE CHILD'S AGE  (fe_03_08236-A-0009)
AND I BELIEVE IT SHOULD ALSO INVOLVE THE CONTENT IN THE BOOKS  (fe_03_08236-A-0010)
I THINK THE MORALS IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE KIND OF GONE DOWNHILL  (fe_03_08236-A-0011)
AND I BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD KIND OF WATCH JUST A LITTLE BIT MAYBE WHAT OUR YOUNGER CHILDREN READ  (fe_03_08236-A-0012)
MAYBE NOTHING TOO VIOLENT AND MAYBE NOTHING TOO  (fe_03_08236-A-0013)
UM SEXY AND LURID FOR THESE YOUNGER CHILDREN  (fe_03_08236-A-0014)
WELL AND I ALSO BELIEVE THAT IT DEPENDS ON THE AREA THAT YOU LIVE IN I LIVE IN A VERY RURAL AREA  (fe_03_08236-A-0015)
THEREFORE THE TOWN CLOSEST TO ME IS SMALL IT HAS PROBABLY A THOUSAND OR FIFTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE IT'S JUST A SMALL TOWN AND HERE YOU'VE GOT COUNTRY UM FARM PEOPLE A LOT OF FARM PEOPLE  (fe_03_08236-A-0016)
WHO  (fe_03_08236-A-0017)
ARE A LITTLE MORE STRICT WITH  (fe_03_08236-A-0018)
WHAT THE CHILDREN ARE LEARNING AND DOING  (fe_03_08236-A-0019)
LIKE LESS TATTOOS AND LESS THINGS SO I BELIEVE THAT A LOT DEPENDS ON THE AREA WE HAD HERE ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS AGO WE HAD A PARENT UH COMPLAIN ABOUT THE BRIAN PICOLO STORY  (fe_03_08236-A-0020)
BECAUSE IT HAD S- QUITE A FEW  (fe_03_08236-A-0021)
REALLY BAD WORDS BUT YOU CAN'T PROTECT CHILDREN FROM EVERYTHING  (fe_03_08236-A-0022)
SO I THINK THAT YOU NEED TO INTRODUCE THESE THINGS TO THEM BUT AT A RIGHT AGE AND I THINK THAT IT HAS TO BE A DECISION MADE MAYBE BY PARENTS AND TEACHERS AND SCHOOL BOARD  (fe_03_08236-A-0023)
WHAT IS ACCEPTABLE AND WHAT ISN'T TO THESE CHILDREN AND WHAT AGE YOU CAN INTRODUCE THESE THINGS TO THEM  (fe_03_08236-A-0024)
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T KEEP IT ALL AWAY FROM THEM  (fe_03_08236-A-0025)
YOU'VE GOT TO FACE IT [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08236-A-0026)
YES I THINK SO TOO BUT I DO THINK THERE SHOULD BE A LITTLE BIT OF COMMON SENSE USED UM I WOULDN'T LIKE TO SEE THEM BAN BAN BOOKS I WOULD LIKE THEM TO BE MADE AVAILABLE BUT BY AGE GROUPS YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08236-A-0027)

MHM  (fe_03_08236-A-0031)
[LAUGHTER] WELL LIKE I SAID I'VE ALWAYS LIVED WITHIN FIFTY MILES OF WHERE I LIVE NOW I WAS BORN WITHIN FIFTY MILES OF HERE SO I THINK PROBABLY SOME OF OUR OPINIONS ARE DIFFERENT BUT BASICALLY WE AGREE  (fe_03_08236-A-0032)
THAT SCHOOLS DO HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY  (fe_03_08236-A-0033)
AND I THINK THEY'RE BEGINNING TO I THINK EVERYTHING IN THE COUNTRY NOT ONLY THE SCHOOLS IS BEGINNING TO BE GET TO GET LAX BECAUSE THEY DON'T  (fe_03_08236-A-0034)
WANT TO GET IN TROUBLE WITH THE LAW BY SAYING HEY YOU CAN'T READ THIS BOOK OR WE DON'T THINK THIS BOOK IS ADEQUATE BUT STILL YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME SORT OF A A SETUP BY THE AGE KIDS I I JUST  (fe_03_08236-A-0035)
YEAH AND I THINK IT WOULD BE NICE IF THERE'S A BOOK THAT'S A LITTLE QUESTIONABLE THEN IT WOULD BE NICE IF THE BOOK IS READ IN THE CLASS ROOM WHERE ADULTS AND CHILDREN CAN DISCUSS IT AND CLEAR UP ANY MAYBE MISCONCEPTIONS THEY HAVE OF THE BOOK  (fe_03_08236-A-0036)
YOU KNOW SOMETIMES THEY JUST NEED A LITTLE GUIDANCE TO SAY DO YOU THINK THIS WAS DONE PROPERLY OR NOT AND MAYBE IF THEY WOULD GET IN WITH THE TEACHERS EVEN MAYBE BRING IN SOME PARENTS THEIR PARENTS  (fe_03_08236-A-0037)
YES I I AGREE I I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT AND I DON'T THINK YOU SEE THIS AS MUCH ANY MORE I DON'T THINK  (fe_03_08236-A-0038)
THAT MOST TEACHERS TODAY LIKE THEY USED TO LIKE WHEN I WAS GROWING UP YOUR TEACHER COULD BE YOUR BEST FRIEND TODAY TEACHERS ARE THERE TO TEACH AND GET OUT AND THEY DON'T WANT TO TAKE THE TIME TO DISCUSS THESE BOOKS WITH THE CHILDREN  (fe_03_08236-A-0039)
YES  (fe_03_08236-A-0040)
OH YES OR WE COULD BE SUED FOR TALKING [LAUGHTER] BUT I BUT I DO THINK THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN BOOKS I'M NOT SAYING THEY SHOULD TAKE 'EM COMPLETELY OUT BECAUSE THEY'LL GET 'EM SOMEPLACE ELSE  (fe_03_08236-A-0041)
UH  (fe_03_08236-A-0042)
CHILDREN OR BOYS ARE GOING TO GO OUT AND BUY GIRLIE MAGAZINES AND GIRLS ARE GOING TO GO OUT AND BUY MAGAZINES THAT MAYBE AREN'T GOOD AND THEY'LL JUST HIDE 'EM WHEN THEY GET HOME  (fe_03_08236-A-0043)
THERE ISN'T THE PARENTAL SUPERVISION THERE USED TO BE PARENTS WORK MORE NOW KIDS ARE ALONE MORE THEY'RE SUBJECTED TO THE TELEVISION THEY'RE SUBJECTED TO THE COMPUTER  (fe_03_08236-A-0044)
THERE ACTUALLY PROBABLY ISN'T MUCH THAT MOST CHILDREN DON'T KNOW  (fe_03_08236-A-0045)
BY THE TIME THEY'RE FIVE OR SIX SEVEN YEARS OLD THAT THEY DON'T KNOW OR HAVEN'T SEEN SOMEPLACE  (fe_03_08236-A-0046)
BUT I THINK THEY SHOULD GET WITH ADULTS AND DISCUSS THESE THINGS AND THE BOOKS AND I THINK THOSE BOOKS  (fe_03_08236-A-0047)
YES  (fe_03_08236-A-0048)
NO MOST OF 'EM WOULD NOT READ A BOOK FIRST NO  (fe_03_08236-A-0049)
