I DON'T KNOW I LIKE I THINK THE CENSORSHIP IS  (fe_03_08278-A-0037)
IS MORE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PARENTS THAN IT IS FOR THE KIDS  (fe_03_08278-A-0038)
LIKE I REMEMBER AS A KID AS A KID I WOULD BASICALLY IF IF MY PARENT TOLD ME THAT I SHOULDN'T READ SOMETHING THAT WOULD JUST MAKE ME READ IT MORE AND I THINK I THINK THAT CENSORING JUST MAKES  (fe_03_08278-A-0039)
THE PARENTS FEEL BETTER IT MAKES THEM THINK THAT THEY'RE DOING A GOOD JOB RAISING THEIR CHILDREN [NOISE]  (fe_03_08278-A-0040)

THIS ISSUE [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08278-A-0073)
ALL RIGHT WELL AS A RECAP I THINK  (fe_03_08278-A-0074)
MY BASIC OPINION IS THAT UH  (fe_03_08278-A-0075)
CENSORING BOOKS IS PROBABLY NOT A GOOD IDEA IN ALMOST IN ALMOST ALL CASES EXCEPT FOR THE MOST OBVIOUSLY EXTREME STUFF UM  (fe_03_08278-A-0076)
BECAUSE I THINK THAT JUST READING ANYTHING SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED  (fe_03_08278-A-0077)
BUT BUT T._V. IS ANOTH- ANOTHER MATTER BECAUSE IT'S IT'S PASSIVE ENTERTAINMENT AND YOU DON'T YOU DON'T NEED TO USE YOUR MIND TO UH  (fe_03_08278-A-0078)
TO DO IT  (fe_03_08278-A-0079)
BUT  (fe_03_08278-A-0080)
PRETTY GOOD  (fe_03_08278-B-0002)
UH MY NAME'S GABRIEL WHAT'S YOUR NAME  (fe_03_08278-B-0005)
CLINT  (fe_03_08278-B-0006)
YA WHAT DID YOU GET THE TOPIC IT'S ABOUT SCHOOLS AND CENSORSHIP  (fe_03_08278-B-0008)
SO I GOT IT IT WAS ABOUT BOOKS USING BOOKS SO WE THINK IT'S ABOUT IS IT APPROPRIATE TO CENSOR CERTAIN BOOKS IN SCHOOL  (fe_03_08278-B-0009)
MAYBE THAT'S IT  (fe_03_08278-B-0010)
OH YEAH SURE  (fe_03_08278-B-0011)
UM OH YOU KNOW IT'S UH I GUESS I GUESS  (fe_03_08278-B-0012)
THE CASE THE CASES WHERE IT'S BEEN UH  (fe_03_08278-B-0013)
AN ISSUE IS UH IS PROBABLY WITH  (fe_03_08278-B-0014)
LITERATURE THAT THAT YOU KNOW MAYBE A LITTLE BIT TOO UM  (fe_03_08278-B-0015)
LANGUAGE OF IT SEXUAL CONTENT OR SOMETHING IS TOO MUCH AND THEN I  (fe_03_08278-B-0016)
WOULDN'T AND THEN I WOULDN'T THINK THAT CENSORSHIP UM YOU  (fe_03_08278-B-0017)

YOU CAN'T YOU KNOW IN THE END IT'S UP TO THE PARENT TO DECIDE WHAT THEY WANT THEIR CHILDREN READING AND YOU CAN YOU KNOW IN  (fe_03_08278-B-0023)
SCHOOLS YOU CAN ALWAYS GET YOUR PARENTS TO SAY I CAN'T READ THIS AND THEY GET A LITTLE NOTE SO THERE SHOULD BE SOME REASONABLE LEVEL OF CENSORSHIP THAT THAT ISN'T LIKE TOO MUCH FOR AND THAT PARENT WILL BE UPSET BUT ISN'T YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08278-B-0024)
YOU KNOW TOO TOO LITTLE THAT EVERY ALL THE PARENTS ARE GOING TO BE WRITING NOTES TO  (fe_03_08278-B-0025)
