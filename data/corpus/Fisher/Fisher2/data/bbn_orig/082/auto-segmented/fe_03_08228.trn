THEY'VE TAKEN SO MUCH AWAY THAT DOESN'T HELP THE CHILDREN IT MAKES IT WORSE  (fe_03_08228-A-0010)
CORRECT I AGREE AND I THINK THAT THE TEACHERS' AND THE PRINCIPALS' AND THE ADMINISTRATORS' HANDS ARE TIED BECAUSE OF WHAT THE LAWS ARE NOW TELLING 'EM THEY CANNOT DO  (fe_03_08228-A-0011)
WELL AND  (fe_03_08228-A-0012)
YEAH WHEN MY CHILDREN WERE IN SCHOOL I KNEW THAT ANYTHING THEY BROUGHT HOME FROM THE SCHOOL I DIDN'T HAVE TO CENSOR IT I KNEW THAT IT WAS OKAY FOR THEM TO READ  (fe_03_08228-A-0013)
THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING IN THE SCHOOL LIBRARY THEY SHOULD NOT BE READING  (fe_03_08228-A-0014)
UM  (fe_03_08228-A-0015)
AND BACK IN THOSE DAYS I MEAN EVEN THE  (fe_03_08228-A-0016)
LIBRARIES THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT NOW I DID MAKE SURE  (fe_03_08228-A-0017)
WHAT THEY WERE READING FROM THE LIBRARY BUT THERE WERE SECTIONS THAT YOU KNEW FOR THAT AGE WERE OKAY  (fe_03_08228-A-0018)
AND THE SCHOOLS WERE THE SAME WAY I THINK THAT  (fe_03_08228-A-0019)
I THINK THAT HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS CAN READ THINGS THAT I WOULD NOT OKAY FOR GRADE SCHOOL  (fe_03_08228-A-0020)

SEX EDUCATION CLASS AND A NOTE CAME HOME WHETHER WE WOULD ALLOW IT  (fe_03_08228-A-0025)
AND I WENT TO THE TEACHER AND I SAID I WANT TO SEE THE CURRICULUM THAT YOU'RE USING  (fe_03_08228-A-0026)
AND THE TEACHER TOLD ME I WAS THE ONLY PARENT WHO EVEN WENT TO CHECK OUT WHAT THE CURRICULUM WAS  (fe_03_08228-A-0027)
SO  (fe_03_08228-A-0028)

WELL YEAH B-  (fe_03_08228-A-0030)
MHM  (fe_03_08228-A-0031)
RIGHT AND I DON'T  (fe_03_08228-A-0032)
I THINK IT'S TOO BAD WHEN PARENTS ARE  (fe_03_08228-A-0033)
FORCED INTO CHOOSING A PRIVATE SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY CAN'T TRUST  (fe_03_08228-A-0034)
WHAT MAY BE TAUGHT IN A PUBLIC SCHOOL  (fe_03_08228-A-0035)
THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT  (fe_03_08228-A-0036)
WELL I JUST  (fe_03_08228-A-0037)

PRODUCE ANY  (fe_03_08228-A-0039)
ANY TEXTBOOK  (fe_03_08228-A-0040)

WELL  (fe_03_08228-A-0043)
YEAH  (fe_03_08228-A-0044)
ON ON THE OTHER HAND I THINK THAT TEACHERS  (fe_03_08228-A-0045)
ARE EXPECTED MORE AND MORE TO DO PARENTAL JOBS LIKE TEACHING DISCIPLINE AND TEACHING MANNERS AND  (fe_03_08228-A-0046)
AND THAT'S NOT RIGHT  (fe_03_08228-A-0047)
THAT'S RIGHT  (fe_03_08228-A-0048)
AND AND NOT ONLY THAT I I HAVE MANY FRIENDS WHO ARE TEACHERS UM  (fe_03_08228-A-0049)
THEY GET A CLASS OF KIDS AND THEY'RE EXPECTED TO TEACH AT WHATEVER LEVEL EACH CHILD IS  (fe_03_08228-A-0050)

THAT ABOUT TEXTBOOKS I I  (fe_03_08228-A-0052)
[LIPSMACK] I TELL YOU I JUST CANNOT SEE  (fe_03_08228-A-0053)
ALLOWING WHATEVER BOOKS INTO SCHOOLS WHETHER IT'S IN THE CLASSROOM OR WHETHER IT'S IN THE LIBRARY  (fe_03_08228-A-0054)

THE PEOPLE IN THAT DISTRICT FEEL I GUESS THERE MIGHT BE YOU KNOW BIG CITIES AND WHERE WHERE PEOPLE  (fe_03_08228-A-0081)
WANT TO HAVE THAT KIND OF A THING BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE IT AH AS IT IS CHILDREN GET ACCESS TO WAY WAY MORE THAN WHAT THEY SHOULD AND IT OUGHT TO BE SAFE IN THE SCHOOLS  (fe_03_08228-A-0082)
THAT'S RIGHT  (fe_03_08228-A-0083)
YES  (fe_03_08228-B-0002)
I'M RACHEL AND THIS IS THE FIRST SURVEY THAT I'VE PARTICIPATED IN [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08228-B-0003)

CERTAIN BOOKS IF YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08228-B-0008)
AH  (fe_03_08228-B-0009)
EXACTLY AND I BELIEVE THAT THERE WOULDN'T BE SUCH A NEED FOR PRIVATE SCHOOL EDUCATION IF THERE WERE MORE CENSORSHIP IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM  (fe_03_08228-B-0010)
EXACTLY EVERYONE IS SO LAWSUIT HAPPY THEY WANT TO SUE BECAUSE THEY  (fe_03_08228-B-0011)

EXACTLY  (fe_03_08228-B-0016)
EXACTLY SURE  (fe_03_08228-B-0017)
AND I JUST FEEL LIKE IT SHOULD BE MORE YOU KNOW THE SCHOOLS SHOULD MONITOR IT AND THEN  (fe_03_08228-B-0018)
IT SHOULD BE UP TO THE PARENTS YOU KNOW AFTER THAT TO DECIDE HEY YOU KNOW IF THEY IF IF THE SCHOOLS DECIDE THAT CENSOR- THEY WANT TO CENSOR OUT CERTAIN THINGS AND LEAVE CERTAIN THINGS I THINK THE PARENTS SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY HEY I DON'T WANT MY CHILD READING ABOUT THIS  (fe_03_08228-B-0019)
OR I DON'T WANT MY CHILD BEING EXPOSED TO THIS WE DON'T PARTICIPATE IN THIS SORT OF LIFESTYLE YOU KNOW WHATEVER  (fe_03_08228-B-0020)
LIKE THAT  (fe_03_08228-B-0021)
HM  (fe_03_08228-B-0022)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_08228-B-0023)
THAT'S THAT'S CERTAINLY HOW I FEEL AS WELL I'VE GOT A FOUR YEAR OLD SON AND SO THAT'S ALL KIND OF SCARY TO ME KNOW [LAUGHTER] BECAUSE WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL IT WAS JUST LIKE YOU SAID WE HAD A NOTE SENT HOME THAT SAID THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING TODAY  (fe_03_08228-B-0024)
YOUR PARENT HAD TO SIGN IT AND SEND IT IN OR OR YOU COULDN'T GO TO THAT PARTICULAR CLASS  (fe_03_08228-B-0025)
RIGHT RIGHT AND BECAUSE SO MANY THINGS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OUT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL YOU KNOW CURRICULUM YOU KNOW I TO ME THINGS HAVE BEEN CENSORED OUT THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE AND THEY'VE LEFT THE THINGS THAT SHOULDN'T YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08228-B-0026)
THAT THE THINGS THAT SHOULD BE THERE THEY'VE TAKEN AWAY AND THE THINGS THAT SHOULDN'T BE THERE THEY'RE LEAVING THERE  (fe_03_08228-B-0027)
AND SO THAT'S WHY WE'VE CHOSEN TO YOU KNOW DO PRIVATE SCHOOL BECAUSE WE WANT OUR CHILD IN A CHRISTIAN ENVIRONMENT AND YOU KNOW LIKE THAT SO  (fe_03_08228-B-0028)
RIGHT RIGHT AND I HATE TO SAY IT BUT  (fe_03_08228-B-0029)
A LOT OF TEACHERS ARE NOT TEACHING JUST BECAUSE THEY LOVE CHILDREN AND THEY LOVE TO TEACH THEY'RE TEACHING FOR THE DOLLAR AND FOR THE HOURS YOU KNOW AND THEY'RE NOT CONCERNED YOU KNOW SOME OF THEM ARE NOT CONCERNED AS THEY SHOULD BE ABOUT WHAT WHAT'S GOING INTO OUR CHILDREN'S HEADS  (fe_03_08228-B-0030)
AND  (fe_03_08228-B-0031)
YEAH  (fe_03_08228-B-0032)
RIGHT AND THAT'S NOT THEIR JOB IT'S THE PARENTS' JOB THEY'RE PUTTING WAY TOO MUCH ONTO THE TEACHERS YOU KNOW BY DOING THIS  (fe_03_08228-B-0033)
RIGHT AND THAT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE  (fe_03_08228-B-0034)
RIGHT I FEEL IT SHOULD BE A JOINT DECISION BETWEEN THE PARENTS THE TEACHERS THE SCHOOL BOARD YOU KNOW EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE A SAY IN IN WHAT BOOK YOU KNOW IF THEY HAVE TO BRING IT TO A VOTE OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08228-B-0035)
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW THAT WOULD BE HANDLED BECAUSE I'VE NEVER REALLY DEALT WITH THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM YOU KNOW JUST HAVING A KINDERGARTENER BUT  (fe_03_08228-B-0036)

[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08228-B-0043)
MM PROBABLY NOT  (fe_03_08228-B-0044)
RIGHT SO THAT YOU KNOW SO THAT OUR VIEWS ON THINGS LIKE CENSORSHIP WOULD BE  (fe_03_08228-B-0045)
AT LEAST CONSIDERED BEFORE THEY DO BRING SOMETHING LIKE THIS INTO LAW OR I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT IS A LAW NOW YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08228-B-0046)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08228-B-0047)
