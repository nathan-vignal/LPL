SO WHAT DO YOU THINK  (fe_03_08249-B-0004)
[SIGH] I AGREE WITH YOU  (fe_03_08249-B-0005)
WELL YEAH BECAUSE OTHERWISE IF WE IF THEY CENSORED ALL THAT STUFF THEN  (fe_03_08249-B-0006)
I MEAN HOW YOU'D JUST HAVE A BUNCH OF PROGRAMMED KIDS WHO ARE PROGRAMMED INTO THINKING WHATEVER YOU WANT THEM TO THINK  (fe_03_08249-B-0007)
INSTEAD OF WHATEVER YOU KNOW [MN] YOU KNOW BASED OFF OF IF THEY READ THEIR OWN STUFF THEY COULD MAKE THEIR OWN  (fe_03_08249-B-0008)
YOU KNOW THOUGHTS AND PROCESSES ABOUT STUFF  (fe_03_08249-B-0009)
WELL AND THEN YOU CAN YOU KNOW YOU CAN COMPARE AUTHORS AND STUFF LIKE THAT 'CAUSE I KNOW THERE IS SOME LIKE WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL THEY  (fe_03_08249-B-0010)
THEY DIDN'T LET US OR DIDN'T REQUIRE US TO READ YOU KNOW CERTAIN AUTHORS BUT THEN OTHER HIGH SCHOOLS WERE DOING THAT  (fe_03_08249-B-0011)
SO  (fe_03_08249-B-0012)
[NOISE] AND THEN I THINK SOMETIMES THEY CENSOR WHEN THEY WRITE BOOKS TOO [NOISE]  (fe_03_08249-B-0013)
YEAH BECAUSE I HAVE READ THAT THERE ARE SOME HISTORY BOOKS THAT THEY'VE LEFT OUT YOU KNOW CERTAIN THINGS ABOUT UM LIKE THE CIVIL RIGHTS AND UM  (fe_03_08249-B-0014)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08249-B-0015)
YEAH  (fe_03_08249-B-0016)
SEE IN THAT WAY IF THEY YOU KNOW IF THEY DIDN'T LET YOU READ MULTIPLE AUTHORS OF THE SAME SUBJECT THEN YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO COME TO THAT CONCLUSION  (fe_03_08249-B-0017)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08249-B-0018)
RIGHT YOU WOULD THINK OKAY THESE PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE REPRESENTING HISTORY AND THEN WHEN THEY SLANT IT A CERTAIN WAY THAT IS CENSORSHIP IN ITS OWN RIGHT  (fe_03_08249-B-0019)
AND HERE YOU ARE THINKING YOU'RE READING ABOUT HISTORY AND THEN YOU FIND OUT MAYBE THAT WASN'T EXACTLY THE WAY IT HAPPENED [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08249-B-0020)
YEAH I WAS WONDERING WHEN THEY SAID THE TOPIC WAS CENSORSHIP IF WHAT IT WAS GOING TO BE IF IT WAS GOING TO BE T._V. OR BOOKS OR  (fe_03_08249-B-0021)
RIGHT AND THEN  (fe_03_08249-B-0023)
RIGHT AND THEN YEAH THEY SHOULD DEFINITELY ENCOURAGE IT IN SCHOOL  (fe_03_08249-B-0024)
[NOISE] YEAH AND I PROBABLY I PROBABLY THINK THAT A LOT OF PRIVATE SCHOOLS PROBABLY DO TEND TO DO THAT  (fe_03_08249-B-0025)
'CAUSE MY SON USED TO GO TO A PRIVATE SCHOOL TOO AND UM  (fe_03_08249-B-0026)
I THINK THEY TEND AND IT WAS A RELIGIOUS RELIGIOUS PRIVATE SCHOOL AND YEAH THEY TEND TO SLANT THINGS THAT WAY TOO  (fe_03_08249-B-0027)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08249-B-0028)
SEE THAT'S WHY THE WHOLE CENSORSHIP IN SCHOOLS SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU KNOW THEY GROW UP FOR THIRTEEN YEARS THINKING ONE WAY AND THEN OFTEN THEY READ A BOOK AND THEY'LL OH [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08249-B-0029)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08249-B-0030)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08249-B-0031)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08249-B-0032)
YEAH EXACTLY  (fe_03_08249-B-0033)
I MEAN I THINK THAT YOU KNOW IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS THERE SHOULD BE LIKE A YOU KNOW A COMMON DENOMINATOR ON WHAT BOOKS THEY SHOULD READ AND YOU KNOW WHETHER YOU GO READ SOMETHING ELSE IS YOUR OWN  (fe_03_08249-B-0034)
CHOOSING  (fe_03_08249-B-0035)
BUT THEY SHOULDN'T YOU KNOW CENSORSH- YOU KNOW PUT CENSORSHIP ON CERTAIN BOOKS BECAUSE THEY WANT THE KIDS IN THAT SCHOOL TO THINK A CERTAIN WAY  (fe_03_08249-B-0036)
YEAH SEE THIS WHOLE QUESTION COULD BE SLANTED A DIFFERENT WAY AND  (fe_03_08249-B-0037)
MAYBE THAT'S WHY  (fe_03_08249-B-0038)
THEY WANT PEOPLE TO TALK ABOUT IT  (fe_03_08249-B-0039)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08249-B-0040)
YOU KNOW 'CAUSE WHOEVER'S DOING THE STUDY MAY NOT YOU KNOW THEY'RE THINKING ONE WAY ON CENSORSHIP AND THEN  (fe_03_08249-B-0041)
YEAH  (fe_03_08249-B-0042)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08249-B-0043)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08249-B-0044)
WELL YEAH I MEAN YOU CAN YEAH LIKE YOU SAY Y- MEAN YOU DON'T WANT YOU KNOW SECOND OR THIRD GRADERS READING ABOUT SEX OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT THEN THAT MIGHT BE MORE AGE APPROPRIATE DOWN THE ROAD OR WHATEVER  (fe_03_08249-B-0045)
YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08249-B-0046)
SO YEAH I WOULD SAY THERE'S DIFFERENT LEVELS OF CENSORSHIP TOO  (fe_03_08249-B-0047)

RIGHT  (fe_03_08249-B-0054)
YEAH THAT'S WHY YOU KNOW LIKE WE SAID YOU KNOW IN A RELIGIOUS SCHOOL THEY MAY NOT  (fe_03_08249-B-0056)
LET THEM READ A CERTAIN BOOK WELL WHERE IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS THEY WOULD  (fe_03_08249-B-0057)
YOU KNOW DEPENDING ON WHAT THEY'RE YOU KNOW WHAT THEIR CURRICULUM IS AND THAT KIND OF STUFF  (fe_03_08249-B-0058)
YEAH  (fe_03_08249-B-0059)
AGE APPROPRIATE AND THEN  (fe_03_08249-B-0060)
WITHIN THE THE CENSORSHIP ITSELF IT'S GOING TO KIND OF YOU KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO CENSOR WHAT AUTHORS AND THAT KIND OF STUFF THEY'RE GOING TO READ  (fe_03_08249-B-0061)
I MEAN I THINK AGE APPROPRIATE PROBABLY COVERS THE WHOLE THING  (fe_03_08249-B-0062)
BUT THEN I SUPPOSE SOME PARENTS OUT THERE MIGHT THINK SOME THINGS ARE MORE AGE APPROPRIATE THAN OTHERS AND THEN YOU GET INTO A WHOLE -NOTHER REALM OF STUFF  (fe_03_08249-B-0063)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08249-B-0064)
WELL YEAH THERE ARE SOME WACKED UP PARENTS OUT THERE THAT YOU  (fe_03_08249-B-0065)
