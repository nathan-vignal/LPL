BUT UM  (fe_03_08227-A-0053)
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT AVAILABLE ONCE THEY'VE REMOVED THEM FROM THE LIBRARY SYSTEM AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS KIND OF AN ODD WAY FOR THE SCHOOL  (fe_03_08227-A-0054)
TO DECIDE WHAT'S GOING TO BE AVAILABLE FOR THE KIDS TO READ WAS HOW OFTEN IT HAD BEEN CHECKED OUT AND AND IT COULD BE THAT YOU KNOW JUST BOOKS HADN'T BEEN RECOMMENDED OR WEREN'T AVAILABLE BY BEING PLACED ON TOP OF THE SHELVES OR WHATEVER  (fe_03_08227-A-0055)
