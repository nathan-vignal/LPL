MY NAME IS CINDY AND I'M FROM AH MISSOURI  (fe_03_08215-A-0001)
OKAY HAYLEY UM TOPIC OF THE DAY IS CENSORSHIP  (fe_03_08215-A-0002)
WANTING TO KNOW IF THE SCHOOLS HAVE THE RIGHT WAS I UNDERSTANDING I HAD A LITTLE HARD TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING WHAT SHE WAS SAYING BUT I BELIEVE IT SAID HAVE THE RIGHT TO CENSORSHIP WHAT WAS READ AND NOT READ BY THE STUDENTS  (fe_03_08215-A-0003)
OKAY UM WELL I THINK IF THE PARENTS WON'T DO IT THE SCHOOL SHOULD DO IT BUT I THINK THE PARENTS SHOULD BE THE ONES AND I THINK THEY SHOULD SEND A LIST HOME AND AND OKAY IT WITH THE PARENTS  (fe_03_08215-A-0004)
BUT THE PARENTS SHOULD BE THE ONE I WOULD THINK THAT  (fe_03_08215-A-0005)
SHOULD SAY WHAT THEY  (fe_03_08215-A-0006)
WANT THEIR CHILDREN TO READ OR TO NOT READ  (fe_03_08215-A-0007)
EXACTLY I AGREE  (fe_03_08215-A-0008)
I DON'T AH SO I'M NOT I'M NOT ENTIRELY RULING OUT  (fe_03_08215-A-0009)
YOU KNOW THE SCHOOL CENSORSHIP UM  (fe_03_08215-A-0010)
BECAUSE I MEAN LET'S FACE IT WE KNOW THAT SOME PARENTS JUST DON'T YOU KNOW THEY DON'T CARE  (fe_03_08215-A-0011)
WHAT THEIR  (fe_03_08215-A-0012)
RIGHT AND SOME WOULDN'T EVEN LOOK AT THE LIST IF IT WAS SENT HOME  (fe_03_08215-A-0013)
BUT I THINK THAT THE PARENTS SHOULD HAVE THE FIRST RIGHT TO CENSORSHIP NOT THE SCHOOLS  (fe_03_08215-A-0014)
I AGREE EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW THE SCHOOLS ARE RAN BY THE BY THE TAX MONEY AND I UNDERSTAND THAT TOO AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY  (fe_03_08215-A-0015)
THE GOVERNMENT HAS A SAY SO BECAUSE OF THAT BECAUSE IT IS FUNDED  (fe_03_08215-A-0016)
BUT UM STILL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CHILDREN LIKE  (fe_03_08215-A-0017)
RIGHT WHAT THE PARENTS WON'T PICK UP AND THE N- THE OBVIOUSLY SOMEBODY'S GOT TO  (fe_03_08215-A-0018)

UM AS FAR AS IS IT A GOOD THING OR  (fe_03_08215-A-0028)
YOU KNOW I  (fe_03_08215-A-0029)
WHAT YOU HAVE IS YOU HAVE THE HOME LIVES OF THE CHILDREN THAT ARE COMING INTO THE SCHOOLS IT'S NOT THE SCHOOLS THEIR SELF  (fe_03_08215-A-0030)
SO YOU COULD HAVE A VERY UM A PERSON GOING TO A PRIVATE SCHOOL THAT IS VERY ABLE TO PAY THE THE TUITION FEE BUT STILL HAVE A TERRIBLE HOME LIFE AND BE BRINGING STUFF IN AND EXPOSING YOUR CHILDREN TO THAT SO  (fe_03_08215-A-0031)
IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S SIX OF ONE HALF A DOZEN OF THE OTHER I THINK IT'S PARENTS JUST HAVE TO INSTITUTE INTO THEIR CHILDREN  (fe_03_08215-A-0032)
WHAT THEY EXPECT OUT OF THEM  (fe_03_08215-A-0033)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08215-A-0034)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_08215-A-0035)
I AGREE I THINK THE THING THAT I WOULD LOOK AT FOR A PRIVATE OR A PUBLIC IS IS THE CURRICULUM  (fe_03_08215-A-0036)
WHAT THAT IS BECAUSE AS I SAID BEFORE WHATEVER THE THE THE UM  (fe_03_08215-A-0037)
YOU KNOW THE UM [LIPSMACK] ETHICS THE MORALS OR WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL THEM WHATEVER THAT IS IS IN THE SCHOOL  (fe_03_08215-A-0038)
IT IT'S STILL GOING TO BE PEER TO PEER  (fe_03_08215-A-0039)
AND LIKE I SAID YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE OTHER CHILDREN ARE ARE EXPOSING YOUR CHILDREN TO REGARDLESS OF YOU THINK PRIVATE MEANS A LITTLE BIT WELL BRED AND BUT NOT NECESSARILY SO  (fe_03_08215-A-0040)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_08215-A-0041)
RIGHT YEAH BUT IT'S  (fe_03_08215-A-0042)
THAT'S TRUE  (fe_03_08215-A-0043)
THAT IS TRUE YOU DO HAVE THAT I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT THAT ASPECT OF IT BUT YOU THEY DO HAVE A BIT MORE SAY SO A BIT MORE TIGHTER REIN  (fe_03_08215-A-0044)
AND THEN THERE'S ALWAYS HOME SCHOOLING TOO YOU KNOW THEY ALL HAVE PROS AND CONS  (fe_03_08215-A-0045)
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM I ALMOST DID YOU KNOW HOME SCHOOLING WITH WITH MY WITH MINE  (fe_03_08215-A-0046)
UM EXCEPT I HAD TO WORK  (fe_03_08215-A-0047)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08215-A-0048)

YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT'S IT'S GOING ON INTO THE THE WORK LIFE WHEN YOU GET OUT OF SCHOOL IT'S THE STRUCTURE THAT YOU HAVE TO GET UP  (fe_03_08215-A-0050)
YOU HAVE TO GET READY YOU HAVE TO BE ON TIME YOU HAVE TO GO THERE ARE RULES TO FOLLOW I I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL I MEAN I'M NOT OPPOSED TO HOME SCHOOLING EITHER BUT I THINK IT'S  (fe_03_08215-A-0051)
IN TODAY'S SOCIETY THERE ARE SOME PLACES THAT HOME SCHOOLING WOULD PAY OFF YOU KNOW LIKE IN MONTANA I THINK THERE'S SOME SCHOOLS THAT I HAVE A SISTER IN LAW AND SHE SAID THAT HER KIDS HAD TO GO LIKE SIXTY MILES WHEN THEY WERE LITTLE  (fe_03_08215-A-0052)
TO GO TO SCHOOL NOW I'M  (fe_03_08215-A-0053)
THERE'S PROBABLY SOME PLACES STILL LIKE THAT IN AMERICA I'M NOT SURE YOU KNOW I DON'T TRAVEL A LOT BUT IN THAT CASE I CAN SEE WHERE HOME SCHOOLING MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT MORE BENEFICIAL  (fe_03_08215-A-0054)
BUT IN TODAY'S SOCIETY IT PROBABLY WHERE YOU'RE AT WHERE I'M AT IT'S SO SO UM AH  (fe_03_08215-A-0055)
THERE'S SO MUCH POPULATION AROUND  (fe_03_08215-A-0056)
THAT NO I THINK I THINK REGULAR SCHOOL WOULD BE THE THE BEST WAY TO GO WHETHER IT BE YOU KNOW PRIVATE OR PUBLIC  (fe_03_08215-A-0057)
MORE THAN HOME SCHOOLING BUT THEN AGAIN HOME SCHOOLING YOU KNOW HAS A LOT OF NICE ASPECTS TO IT TOO  (fe_03_08215-A-0058)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08215-A-0059)
LESSONS RIGHT  (fe_03_08215-A-0060)

WELL THAT'S TRUE [LAUGHTER] EVERYBODY NEEDS SOME ALONE TIME YOU KNOW [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08215-A-0063)

E- DEFINITELY THE SCHOOL SHOULD COME UP WITH A LIST BECAUSE YOU WOULD THINK THE EDUCATORS WOULD YOU KNOW BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH  (fe_03_08215-B-0010)
GREAT RECOMMENDATIONS AND THEN HAVE THE PARENTS REVIEW IT SO THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO ACTUALLY BE THE FINAL DECISION MAKER ON WHAT THEIR CHILDREN ARE BEING INFLUENCED BY  (fe_03_08215-B-0011)

IN FOCUSING ON YOU KNOW OTHER THINGS FOR THEIR CAREERS AND STUFF BUT THAT CAN BE THE TOTAL OPPOSITE I DON'T THINK THAT YOU KNOW YOU COULD HAVE THAT SITUATION IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOL BOTH  (fe_03_08215-B-0050)
BUT THE MOST ARGUMENTS I HEAR LATELY IS UM THEY SAY THAT IN PUBLIC SCHOOL YOU KNOW THEY HAVE TO ACCEPT EVERYBODY WHEREAS IN PRIVATE SCHOOLS THERE ARE SITUATIONS WHERE THERE IS A TROUBLESOME  (fe_03_08215-B-0051)
CHILD CAUSING PROBLEMS THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO KICK HIM OUT  (fe_03_08215-B-0052)
SO THEN THEY ACT LIKE YOU KNOW THEN THEY'RE NOT HAVING TO BE EXPOSED TO THAT WHERE IN PUBLIC SCHOOL THEY DON'T HAVE THAT OPTION SO YOUR KIDS ARE GOING TO BE EXPOSED TO  (fe_03_08215-B-0053)

I MEAN WE DO THAT EVERYDAY ANYWAYS BUT YOU KNOW AS STRUCTURED TEACHING I MEAN HELPING WITH HOMEWORK'S DIFFERENT THAN ACTUALLY YOU KNOW TEACHING THEM HOW TO DO MATH AND STUFF AND I YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08215-B-0075)
