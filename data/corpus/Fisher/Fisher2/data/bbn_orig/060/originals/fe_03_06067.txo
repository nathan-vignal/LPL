R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello, yes.  My name's Sheryl.
R:  I'm -- I'm sorry.
L:  My name is Sheryl.
R:  Oh, hi Sheryl.  I'm Lacey.
L:  Hi, Lacey.
R:  How's it going?
L:  Pretty good.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Is this -- have you done these calls before?
L:  Uh, this is only the second one.
R:  Oh, yeah.  This is my first [LAUGH].
L:  Oh [LAUGH].
R:  Um, so computer games.  I don't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know nothing about computer games.  Well, rather my knowledge is very limited.  Do you play them?
L:  Uh, I do play them.  Oh, I play some.  Um, mostly I just waste time on the kind of repetitive ones like playing patience, you know, solitaire --
R:  Oh, right.
L:  -- on the computer or, uh, those little marble games.  That kind of thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I like the role playing games too but I haven't been playing them lately, uh, because I played the ones I know and the new ones require a better computer than I have [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, really?  The role playing ones, it seems -- it seems to me that you have to, um, be -- that it'd be hard to do kind of on the side.  That you have to get really into it to really be able to, um, participate.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is that true or is it ...?
L:  Well, I find -- I don't find it hard to get into it but I do find once I start I spend a lot of time on it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Because it's -- it's the only hobby, the only hobby [inaudible] reading or anything.  I don't do the multi player ones and I don't do -- play on the Internet because I don't have a fast enough connection --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, uh, that's -- I think -- I'd kinda like to try some of those games though.  Just out of curiosity.  You know, you read about them or --
R:  Mhm.
L: -- but I've just done the single player ones.
R:  My experience with computer games is usually through kids that I baby-sit.
L:  Oh, yeah [LAUGH].
R:  And they -- to me I'm -- I'm so fascinated by it that I mean, I really feel like their brain just work -- must work at an entirely different way than mine because --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- they can sit there and play and, you know, they usually try and, you know, en- entice me to play around with them or something --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and I can't tell for the life of me what is going on and, you know, they'll try and explain it to me --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and all this stuff and I -- I mean it's so strange, I feel like their eyes and their brains are just wired differently than mine.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, I think so.  Well, they get some experience at it, kids nowadays that, you know ...
R:  Yeah, they do.  And even I understand that, like, you know, the more you do it the more it makes sense to you --
L:  Well, of course.
R:  -- but to me it seems strange that the first time you would sit down in front of it, like in particular with the ones that a lot of -- a lot of my kids are really into, that the first time it would be so overwhelming like what would be incentive to getting to know it.  You know, to, like, learning it to where it --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- does make more sense or is more fun but --
L:  Yeah.  I don't know --
R:  -- I guess it does something --
L:  -- because --
R:  -- for them [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, it -- I don't know 'cause I never got into them when I was really young.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I was a late bloomer but, uh, I -- I suppose it's the feedback.  You know, because you do something and something happens --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and they like that and it gets 'em hooked.  Some of them I find a little hard to get because the ones I was doing most recently like Boulder Escape and stuff like that where you have to -- you know, you take on a role and you have to solve problems and all --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- this kind of stuff, it takes a while to get into -- it takes a while for the story to develop.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I don't think younger kids would go for that so much.
R:  Really?
L:  I think they tend to like the real action type ones --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- with lots of things going on.  But once you described it, your reaction, it's almost like me and sports.  I mean I am --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- hopeless at organized sports [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  And I've had people [LAUGH] sit down and try to explain the rules to me and I just don't get it.
R:  Yeah.  I guess you have to want to enough [LAUGH].
L:  Yes, I think so.
R:  But, uh, yeah, I can -- I can see the appeal to the -- I mean, if the -- kind of the fantasy land or getting into a story, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for some of them but ...
L:  Yeah, I -- I kind of go to the two extremes.  I either like getting into the, you know, the story ones with a story to them or a puzzle to them or something you've got to work out.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And the very simple minded ones when I'm really stressed out, like playing the same patience game over and over and over again.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I mean that's no different than doing it with a pack of cards really [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, yeah, I guess not.
L:  Just easier on a computer.
R:  I played, um, when -- when I was, like, maybe ten years old, my cousin got Super Mario Brothers [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And, uh, I think I tried for a little while to, um, play that.  I -- I got real challenged by it and wanted to master it but I was, uh, definitely have the hand eye coordination that my cousin had [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Well, you have --
R:  I would like -- I would be flailing my arms around my arms around the room.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, I couldn't just hold the -- the joystick in my hand.  I would, you know, kind of like be moving as if --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I was in real --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- virtual --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- like kind of ...
L:  [MN] Yeah, well I guess, you know, ev- everyone likes a different -- different one.  What gets me, of course, is that they come up with new ones and you have to get all the expensive equipment for them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know how people with young children manage.
R:  I know.
L:  I mean, 'cause there are all these ads on TV and stuff for the most expensive types of computer games --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and there's always something new and you know kids are gonna want them.
R:  Right.
L:  And I know -- I know it's expensive.
R:  Are you a Seinfeld fan?
L:  No, I'm not actually [LAUGH].
R:  There's this Seinfeld episode where, um, George -- I don't know if you know the characters.
L:  I know the characters vaguely, yes.
R:  There's a, um, a frogger game, like the -- a video -- you know, one of those big old video games --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like that you would see in an arcade and he's get, um, he gets a frogger.  Do you know that game?
L:  I don't know the game.
R:  It was [LAUGH] -- it was just funny but I guess you have to know it to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to get it but ...
L:  Oh, yeah.  Well, some -- some people [COUGH] yeah, you know I do it myself.  Some people get really obsessed by one particular game --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then it wears off and go onto something else.
R:  Yeah, guess so.  Well, the other experience is, uh, annoyance with people.  For a long time I didn't have a computer at my house --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and all of my, you know, Internet research, emailing had to be done at the library --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I would be waiting on a waiting list for people to be -- who were playing video games [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, dear.  Yes [LAUGH].
R:  You know and I would have something really important like a --
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  -- job application or you know, a paper to write up --
L:  You'd have to wait for them [LAUGH].
R:  -- I have to wait for people to play their computer games [LAUGH] but ...
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, well.  I've been lucky in recent years.  I've got one at home although it's kind of ancient.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I -- and of course I've got -- I've got access at work which is really nice.
R:  Yeah.
L:  A lot faster --
R:  I finally got one.
L:  -- a lot newer.
R:  Yeah, it makes it hard to use your one at home when you get used to the -- how -- how fast the --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- library and the work ones are.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I finally got one at computer too.  It's -- it's pretty old but it's, um, definitely has made my life easier [LAUGH].
L:  Yes, it's surprising how -- you know, how much you get to depend on them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  Well, you know, I -- I guess I use it at work, I use it at home, you know and I -- it's not just for games either. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's for entertainment and, uh, games and entertainment.  Work related stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  School related stuff.  All kinds of things.
R:  Mhm.
L:  How did we manage without computers?
R:  I know [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We did.
L:  Somehow [LAUGH].  Yeah, well I don't often have to wait in line.  Well, when I was a student, of course, and used the university computers --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- sometimes you'd have to wait but if you pick your time of day, you would often go in and there wouldn't be much of a waiting line.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  And besides, uh, you're kinda discouraged over too -- over much computer game playing during --
R:  Right.
L:  -- busy times of the years.
R:  Yeah, I don't -- I don't think they'd allow that in the school computers, well, the school that I went to.  May- I don't know.
L:  No.
R:  Libraries you can do whatever you want [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, you can here too.  I've -- I haven't used them but I've seen them of course because they have the computers out in one of the public rooms.  They don't have them anywhere special.
R:  Mhm.
L:  There's always people on them and they all seem to be doing different things. [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't think there's any requirements at all.  They're public computers, I suppose.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  Oh --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- I'm trying to think if I have anything else to say about computer games.
L:  Computer games, yes. The first one I --
R:  I think I've exhausted my --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [inaudible]
L:  The first call I made was about movies and I don't watch that many movies either [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, really.
L:  [MN]
R:  That'd be a good one.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yesterday I called and they said the topic of the day is affirmative action.  I just hung up [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Oh.
R:  I -- I can't talk just for ten minutes about that.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't -- a little nervous.  It was tempting but --
L:  Yeah, computer games --
R:  -- it's, uh, too overwhelming.
L:  Yeah.  I don't know, what can I say on computer games?  I haven't done any shoot 'em up types in years although I played them at the beginning [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, there was also, um, Atari.  I remember when my first friend got an Atari game --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with Pong.
L:  Oh, I've heard [LAUGH] -- [several inaudible words] like yesterday.
R:  That was like in nineteen eighty two or something.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Um, and what, oh there's was like -- I guess growing up before -- pre Super Mario Brothers --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there was, um, Du- uh, Donkey Kong --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [inaudible] --
L:  Oh, yeah [LAUGH].
R:  -- and Centipede.
L:  I was also a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, little animation.  The animation's gone so -- so --
R:  Oh, my gosh.  It's amazing.
L:  It's unbelievable now.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  What they can do with the animation, is [inaudible]
R:  Yeah, and one -- you know, like that was not that long ago.  In one lifetime they've, uh --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- well, not even a lifetime.  A quarter of a lifetime [LAUGH] they've --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- made huge, yeah, advances in that stuff.
L:  It's not that long ago that Internet access was, you know, not that common.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I mean now I hardly ever, you know, do anything with ordinary mail or anything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The people I keep in touch with, they've all got email.
R:  Yeah, pay your bills and everything so ...
L:  Pay my bills, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Everything's on the Internet.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's really convenient I find --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- although a lot of people don't trust it very much ei- either but I figure it seems safe enough [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  I think so.
L:  It's really convenient.
R:  Of course maybe I'm naive to think so but [MN] --
L:  Well, I can't say I've had any particular problems.  Well, okay, there was the time I tried to pay a phone bill on a phone line that was, you know, cut off two years ago because I moved.
