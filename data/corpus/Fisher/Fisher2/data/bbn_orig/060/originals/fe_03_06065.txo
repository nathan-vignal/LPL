R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Angela.
R:  Hi, I'm Amanda.
L:  Nice to talk to you.
R:  Thank you.
L:  Do you want to answer first or do you want me to?
R:  Uh, you can go ahead.
L:  [MN] Okay, well I guess I would say it depends.  There are some movies that I want to see in the theater but there's other times that I like watching movies at home.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean a lot of times when movies first come out, you know, I wanna see them in the theater, there's some movies I want to see on the big screen but there's also plenty of times that I enjoy staying at home and watching movies.
R:  Yeah, I only go see them if it's a really big deal.  Like I just saw X Men two and the Matrix.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But I usually don't do that.  I usually wait until they're on TV actually.
L:  So you don't pay anything, huh?
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Actually I think -- I think our plan is to go see X Men tomorrow because my -- my husband wanted to see it.  He went -- Wednesday night they had the, like ten o'clock shows here --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, uh, it was sold out [LAUGH].
R:  Well, I -- I was really impressed with it.
L:  Were you?
R:  Yeah, I hadn't seen the first one and I was like, "Oh boy, comic book movies.  This isn't going to be too great" but I was sort of dragged along but I did enjoy it a lot.
L:  Well, good.  Yeah, I was -- I wasn't sure if I was [LAUGH] gonna like it or not.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I kind of -- I tried to get our neighbor with -- with my husband but [LAUGH] he didn't want to see it so -- so I --
R:  But I wasn't so impressed with the Matrix actually.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, the first one.  Everyone, you know -- everyone loved it.  It was great but this next one they -- I don't -- I don't wanna spoil it for you if --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you haven't seen it, so if you don't want me to talk about it I won't but -- it's okay?
L:  Yeah, that's fine.
R:  Yeah, they freaking -- they had like -- like an orgy scene in it and they had all these relationships going on between the characters and it just didn't fit with the theme of the movie at all.
L:  Huh.
R:  I wasn't impressed.
L:  Hm.  Well, it'll be interesting to see.  I was -- I can't -- I cannot remember what the last movie that I saw was because I think --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- well, I saw -- I went and saw, um, Identity but I think I saw something else after that so I think that's technically not the [LAUGH]-- the last one that I saw but I did go see that which that was -- that was good.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It -- it had a lot of twists and turns in it and surprises that I wasn't expecting.
R:  Well, you know, the Matrix is still interesting but the second half was where it got really good.  The first half they could have completely cut out and I wouldn't have missed it all.  Um --
L:  Well, and it's pretty long too, isn't it?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Isn't it like --
R:  I think it's about three hours.
L:  Yeah, that's what I was thinking.  It was -- it was a long movie so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so yeah, if that's the case they probably could [LAUGH] have cut some out and --
R:  X Men is really long too, so be prepared.
L:  Okay [LAUGH].
R:  But it's good.  I also watch [LAUGH] -- I don't -- you know, they're really stupid but I watch a lot of Lifetime movies.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because it's -- it's what's on and it's good background for homework and such.
L:  Yeah, I've actually seen some movies on Lifetime that I've liked too.
R:  They're always very corny.  It's always the evil male and the --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- woman that saves the day.
L:  Yeah, I think I watched a movie there -- I can't -- I don't remember what it was called but yeah, it was like this -- this woman who, um [MN] she -- she started working like kind of as a private detective catching people's spouses --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- cheating and then she --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- found out that her spouse was cheating and [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, typical and then a lot of the time they have -- they either have an overly dramatic courtroom scene or they have, like, unnecessary police brutality.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].  That's true.
R:  That's funny.
L:  Yeah, those are -- those are the kinds of movies that -- that I -- yeah, I like to, you know, like on a Saturday afternoon or something I'll watch but I wouldn't want to pay for those so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but those are definitely better at home [LAUGH] as opposed to in the theater but -- but there are some movies that sometimes come out that, yeah, some of the really big ones that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that --
R:  But then in the theater people often ending up ruining it for you because they clap during it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or --
L:  Actually, you know what, that reminds the last movie [LAUGH] I went to see was Daddy Daycare --
R:  Oh, no.
L:  -- and I got really annoyed because there were -- there were some people, like, sitting just to my left who had brought -- it was a couple and they'd brought their three kids and the oldest one was probably, like, five or something and, you know, he was -- the babies were crying and the older kid was, like, taking the empty cup and throwing it up in the air and stuff and --
R:  Great.  I have no tolerance for kids anymore.
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because I -- I recently moved to New York City to go to school and I -- I found a pretty decent apartment --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but when I moved into it, I wasn't aware that there was -- I went there at night when I first looked at it so I wasn't aware that it was, like, pretty much surrounded by a school.
L:  Oh.
R:  And from eight in the morning until three in the afternoon, it's almost constantly like hour intervals --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- there are children outside screaming and screaming and yelling and --
L:  Yuck.
R:  Yeah, the -- I've called the school.  I've called the noise pollution and, like, nothing can be done about it.
L:  Yuck, that would suck [LAUGH].
R:  I'm talking on the Fisher thing.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Don't worry, it's a toll free number.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, I'm the same way.  I -- I don't -- I don't have kids and I don't -- I don't have much patience for kids and especially -- especially places where they're making noise and [LAUGH] -- and yeah, like the movies are a good example of -- you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you -- you pay to go to see a movie and I don't wanna have to listen to noisy kids --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- during it.  So, yeah, that -- that actually was -- I went and saw that last -- last Sunday I think it was.  It was a good movie but the -- the kids were just so annoying and distracting that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they just kept making noise that, you know, that was one that I --
R:  I probably would have said something --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because I -- I don't -- I can't stand it anymore.  I can stand noisy people in general but not the kids.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Then they load up in their gigantic SUV --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that they'll never take off road.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].  They're -- they're typical little soccer mums and [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.  So, what is your favorite movie?
L:  My favorite movie is probably the Bird Cage or Cool Runnings.
R:  OH [LAUGH] Cool Runnings?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  I -- I love both those movies.  I just think they're both so funny and I don't know, I just -- I -- they're the kind of movies I can watch over and over again [LAUGH].
R:  I have several favorites.  I like -- I like Hackers [LAUGH].
L:  That's a good movie.
R:  And I like the Big Lebowski because it's -- have you seen that?
L:  Yeah, a long time ago.  I don't remember it real well but yeah, I did.
R:  Very quotable --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it's really unpredictable and funny and my -- if I had to choose a favorite, it would probably be Silence of the Lambs.
L:  Oh, that's a good movie.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's a scary movie [LAUGH].
R:  Hannibal I wasn't impressed with.
L:  Yeah, we -- we saw that too and yeah, I didn't -- I didn't like it too much.  Yeah, they -- definitely the -- the earlier [LAUGH] were better.
R:  Mhm.  I haven't seen Red Dragon but I'm not really too excited to see it either because of how much Hannibal sucked.
L:  Yeah, that was -- that was -- of the three that was probably my least favorite.  It was like they went down in quality [LAUGH] you know.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  The Silence of the Lambs was really good and then--
R:  They often do though when they make sequels.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah, they kinda decline with each one and yeah, that -- that definitely happened with those movies [LAUGH].
R:  I don't see how some movies get made too, like, you know there's five Airbud movies.
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I didn't know that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's hard to believe.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I guess there's lots of those -- those parents that'll take their kids to see [LAUGH] every one --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so that's probably -- that's probably what they're counting on --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is all those --
R:  The Country Bears.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH]
L:  Well, and that, um -- oh, what is that?  That Lizzie McGuire movie that's out now.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh no.
L:  I know.  I was reading in a magazine today about how popular it was and how well it did, like, it's opening weekend and I was just amazed that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it's probably one that I'm sure they'll be churning out some sequels to soon and -- [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, yeah.  There are billboards about that all over New York.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I can imagine because, yeah, it looks like -- it looks like everybody's taking their kids to see it so I'm sure they'll -- they'll capitalize on that pretty soon.
R:  Yeah, I don't -- I don't -- I don't -- I actually enjoy animated Disney movies though for the most part.
L:  Yeah, those are -- yeah, I've bought like a couple of the -- some of the animated -- I mean, like the Toy Story and Shrek and stuff like that.
R:  I like the older ones like, uh, the Fox and the Hound.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's [inaudible]
L:  Yeah, those are good too.
R:  Because they're not all happy.  They usually have a little slice of reality at least.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, and I saw Spirited Away.  You heard about that?
L:  No.  I've never heard of it.
R:  Oh, it's, um, it was originally Japanese and they dubbed English over it.  It won some kind of award, I don't know, but the animation is just fantastic and the story, it's a little strange.  It's not what we're used to as Americans I guess --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I enjoyed it a lot.  It's -- it's okay for adults too.  You probably wouldn't be bored.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um --
L:  Oh, I'll have to watch for that.
R:  Miasake[?] I think is the guy's name that does those.  I don't like the other Japanese animation though.  It's all like [MN] robots fighting one another and then that's it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, those aren't much good -- much fun.  I -- I live in really rural Nebraska though so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- probably [LAUGH] the one that you just mentioned --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- probably won't come to here.  That's probably one I'll have to look for --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- on video 'cause we don't -- we only have two theaters in town with a total of, like, I guess, seven screens.
