R:  Hi, my name's Wendy.
L:  Hi, Wen-- hi Wendy.  My name's Marsha.
R:  Hi. 
L:  This is the first time I've done this so --
R:  Oh, is it? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  This is the last time I'm doing it.
L:  Oh.
R:  I just -- you supposed to get three phone calls [LAUGH].
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, so do you -- you like going to the movies or ...
L:  Well, I tell ya, we went to -- I did some kind of a -- I did a mystery shopping and we did -- we watched a movie and that was the first movie we -- my husband and I had been to in two years.
R:  Oh, when -- and when was this?  Recently?
L:  Oh, yeah.  It was about three weeks ago probably.
R:  [LAUGH] That's so funny because last weekend my husband, I told him, I said, "You're taking me out for Mother's Day".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  This is the first movie we had went and seen too for the past two years too because my son, he just turned two and ever since he was born, we just don't ever find the time to go [LAUGH].
L:  Well, and it's no fun to take the -- take a -- a young child.
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  And it's no fun to pay the baby-sitter.
R:  Right, right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, we have older kids and it's just -- it's just so much more convenient to rent a movie.
R:  Yeah, that's -- same here.
L:  And my -- my husband works evening and he doesn't get -- a lot of times doesn't get off till ten or so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so we -- you know, he'll come home and he doesn't want to go out to a movie or go out and do anything, you know [NOISE].
R:  Right.
L:  We might rent a movie and stay home.
R:  That's like us.  Like my husband, he hates going to the movies.  He says that it's way overpriced and too uncomfortable [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so we always just rent 'em too and he, um, -- that's why for Mother's Day I'll think well it's my day and I like going to the movies so you're taking me [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, I do enjoy going [NOISE] to them but I don't [NOISE] enjoy paying the price.
R:  I know.  It's so expensive.
L:  It's ridiculous, and the last movie we saw, I don't even remember the name of it, and it was not -- it was not one that I would -- oh, it was Phone Booth.  Oh, that was awful.
R:  Was it really 'cause --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I was gonna go see it?
L:  Well, only if you like to, uh, hear ev- ev- every other word being a F word.
R:  No.  Oh, I'm glad --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you told me that.  I'm glad you told me that.  No.  I'll tell you a really good one to see.  Um, we went and saw Steve Martin's Bringing Down the House last weekend and --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- it was hilarious.  I like Steve Martin because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- he's pretty much good clean humor.
L:  Right.
R:  And it was just so funny.  I definitely will recommend that.  It's a really good movie [LAUGH].
L:  Well, the one I kinda wouldn't mind seeing because I like the Matrix --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- was the new Matrix one.
R:  That's what my --
L:  That would have been good on, uh, on a big screen TV.
R:  Yeah.  My husband wants to see that too.
L:  [NOISE] And the other one I thought that would have been good was, uh -- that we did not see -- [NOISE] I'm just hanging up a different phone, was --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I think the Lord of the Rings would have been good on --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- the big screen and we didn't see that.  I mean, my kids did --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but we didn't.  I mean, well you don't have old kids, older kids.  Yeah, the teenagers seemed to have way more money to spend that we do.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh my gosh.  Yeah, we just have the one right now so [LAUGH] -- and he ties up most of our time so that's why, you know, we never get out.  That's -- my Mum came to baby-sit last weekend, thank goodness.  I had to get out of this house but it was -- it was great.  I really enjoyed going to that movie but, um, yeah with being stranded in a house most of the time, my husband finally decided to invest in getting a home entertainment center thing --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- with the surround sound --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- which is nice if we could just use it more frequently because during the day we can't use it because my son's running around and during the night time we can't turn it on because it's too loud so [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, so do --is it like in the wall then?  I mean, --
R:  Yeah, we --
L:  -- a big one.
R:  -- he hung it -- uh, he hung the speakers up in the ceiling and --
L:  In the ceiling?
R:  -- so it's like it really sounds like you're in a theater.  Now, we just need to get the big screen to go with it [LAUGH].
L:  Oh.  I tell ya, we looked at some of those big screens and we didn't, uh -- if you stand on the side --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they look gray.  You ever looked at some of those -- some of those --
R:  Really?  No.
L:  Yeah.  Stand on the side and see if you can see the picture.  It -- it -- the picture is distorted.  You can't even see it --
R:  Really?
L:  -- unless you get a really, really, really expensive one.
R:  Oh, now that won't be me [LAUGH].
L:  Yes.  If you get one that's under a thousand dollars, you sit -- if you're not sitting directly in front of the TV, you're not going to be able to see anything.
R:  That's funny because my brother just got one and my Mum said that the people look kinda like squashed on it.  Like they looked -- it -- it looked funny.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't know.
L:  Well, you'll have to view it from the side and see if -- if, um, like, if you just don't -- you just don't -- at least the ones we saw, you just didn't even see anything.  It was just almost like black.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  Well, I'm glad you're telling me this.  I'll have to definitely check 'em out then.
L:  Yeah, just check it out.  Now, our neighbors got a two thousand some dollar one, I mean so theirs looks good.
R:  Really?
L:  But the more money you spend, then -- then you --
R:  Of course, the better it'll be.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, but [NOISE] yes, we definitely prefer watching videos.
R:  So do I.  I, um, I actually though I've -- I like to get the DVDs.  We've got the DVD player now and [MN] I went and I bought my son all these little video tapes for his birthday and my husband's like, "Why are you buying those still?"  He's like, "VCRs are probably gonna be gone within the next few years" and I have --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- all these tapes.
L:  There'll still be some diehards.  So, we do have a DVD player but we have to get a new one because it seems to be eating them.  It's not [NOISE] very DVD receptive [LAUGH].
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.
L:  It's an older one so ...
R:  I don't -- I -- I really like my VCR.  To me it's just easier to use.  My husband's more into the advanced technology but I'm kinda like old fashioned.  I like my VCR player so [LAUGH] I guess I'm probably one of the last few that says that but [LAUGH] ...
L:  Oh, well.  Now, they're like Veggietales or something like that.  That's probably what you're getting, isn't it?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Stuff like that.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  They'll -- they'll -- they'll be good on VC- on your video.
R:  Right.
L:  -- They'll -- they'll last a long time.
R:  Hopefully, yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  But, um, anyways [MN] so ...
L:  What was the last, uh, one you rented?
R:  Um, gosh.  Oh, it was the Ring.  That was really good.
L:  Oh, the Ring?
R:  Yes, it was really scary though.
L:  Oh, that was the one with the, um, the crop dusting things.  Is that -- is that the Ring?
R:  No.  That's --
L:  Oh, the Ring -- is that -- or is that the tower one with, uh, oh, like the Two Towers.  Isn't that -- that's the one isn't it?
R:  Um, I'm trying to think.
L:  With Gandalf.  Isn't that the Ring?
R:  I -- I don't know.  I can't even remember who played in it.  I just remember because it was a wild -- it was probably a month ago when we rented it but it -- I just remember it being really scary and really good [LAUGH].  It was a good movie.
L:  It wasn't the one with the little hobbit?  It wasn't the hobbit?  That's not what the Ring is about?
R:  No.
L:  Okay.  I couldn't remember what that was called because one of the trilogy is called the ring.  You know, they're searching for the ring but I think the ring -- the movie, the Ring, must be something different.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We -- have you seen My Big, Fat Greek Wedding?
R:  No.  Have you --
L:  Oh, that is --
R:  -- seen it?
L:  -- really good.
R:  Is it?
L:  Really, really good.
R:  It's got a lot of hype about it.  I've been wondering, you know, if we should rent it or not.  I hear a lot about it.
L:  Well, one of the things we look for as good is something that we're not uncomfortable with watching with our teenage boys --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or our girls so there -- it was, you know, it was just good, clean [NOISE] you know, it wasn't a doc- you know, it was more -- it was not for little kids --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but it was -- there -- there wasn't a lot of cussing.  There wasn't any sex, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and that's the kind of stuff we look for when we're trying to rent a movie.
R:  So do we.  Yeah, well I'm glad you told me that.  That'll have to be -- that'll probably be my next rental then [LAUGH] 'cause I've been wanting to see that.  I just -- I, um, I didn't know anybody that had seen it personally.
L:  Yeah, we --
R:  I've heard a lot about it.  
L:  I was trying to think there was another we saw that was pretty good.  Um, we like more action ones.
R:  So does my husband.
L:  Um, I'm trying to think of the last action one we saw that was decent.  Some of them are just -- they're just --
R:  Violent.
L:  Well, and you know, and this is sad to say but I -- I'm accepting more violence versus the sex and the -- and the cussing every other word.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know what you mean.
L:  Where, you know -- we could -- I -- we can --we can handle the violence.  I mean, I don't like it as much but I prefer that over the, uh --
R:  Sex scenes in the movie --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with your children in the room [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I know what you mean.
L:  And it -- they don't even have to put those in there.  It doesn't -- I mean, it wouldn't take anything away.
R:  Right, for the movie, yeah.
L:  The same way with the cussing.  It would, uh --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They don't have to -- I mean, a little bit is okay but I just don't like to hear every other word.
R:  And especially, you know, they could leave out the "f" word [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Like what --
L:  Now, this [several inaudible words] why do they have to say --
R:  "f" this, "f" that.
L:  -- everything is "f" this and "f" that.
R:  Yeah, I know [LAUGH].  You sound like me [LAUGH].
L:  [MN]
R:  Yeah, but, um --
L:  Where are you from?
R:  I'm in Florida.
L:  You're in Florida.  Oh gosh, it must be -- [MN] is it still only nine thirty there?
R:  No, it's --
L:  It's ten thirty.
R:  -- ten.  I think it's about ten thirty.  Where are you at?
L:  Excuse me, Illinois.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, it's only nine thirty here.
R:  Yeah, I don't -- well, my husband's watching a race tonight and I don't watch racing so I'm like, "Whatever.  I guess I'll make one of these phone calls because I don't have anything else to do" [LAUGH].
L:  Now, how did you hear about this?
R:  Um, actually I've been -- I took an interest in mystery shopping lately [LAUGH] and I went to a website where they had, like, a chat room on it and, um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they were talking about this so I signed up [LAUGH].
L:  Well, I heard it about it.
