L:  Hi, my name is Beth.
R:  Hi, my name is Kim.
L:  How are you?
R:  Fine.
L:  Good.  Um, we're talking about current events.
R:  Yes, ma'am. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I think we have plenty to talk about.
R:  [LAUGH] Hold on a second.  You may take a five minute break.  [NOISE]  Okay.
L:  Ha- How do you get your news, then?
R:  I listen to the Christian radio station.  I don't need to watch television.  For me there's enough trash on TV I don't need.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] Amen to that.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] All I need it is for the weather.  I -- 
L:  W- -- 
R:  -- just time it just right to get the weather.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Then I shut it off and then I don't want to hear nothing.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, good for you.  You have a lot more discipline than I do.  I, ah, get a lot of mine from, ah, on line.  Ah, I access my newspaper on line and, ah, usually read that every morning and I get the -- the weather and you know, everything that's going on. 
R:  And I live on the state line so I don't get my state, I get the next state.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, no.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Which is fine because there really isn't much that I need to see.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Which state do you border?
R:  I border North Carolina.
L:  Oh, do you?  Well, I live in North Carolina.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I -- I live right on the line from Virginia.
L:  Okay.  All right.  Great.  So, the current events of the day are [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] I have -- I've been too busy home schooling the kids to pay attention what today's current events are.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay.  So, you -- actually you're probably telling me, ah, your current events are probably more weekly events.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes.  You know, ah, ah, because I get Rollies[?] news, um, channel five and eleven, so whatever comes on through them, but I try to time it just right to get the weather.
L:  Right.
R:  And occasionally if something I feel I need to know that I, you know, I stay, like the war kinda -- I don't need to -- to be glued to the television.
L:  Right -- 
R:  Ah, c- -- I just don't feel that we need to know every day's gruesome details.
L:  Yeah.  So, how did you handle that with the kids in so far as -- 
R:  Well, [SIGH] see what -- ah, that was kind of difficult because I have a fifteen year old and I have a six year old.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay.
R:  And I don't feel that -- that my children -- times have changed, so I don't feel that my children need to know everything.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, [SIGH] we knew about the Trade Center because it was interesting.  I happened to have the news on that day.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And my five year old saw it as well.
L:  Right.
R:  And I just don't feel that they need to see everything, they need to hear everything because in childrens' +minds, whether you're fifteen or whether you're six, you never know where their mind's going to be or how they're going to handle it.
L:  Right.
R:  So -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- you know, occasionally we'll watch the news because once a week I might like to be updated what goes on.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, I would rather hear it in the Christian radio station or on the classical station then I get everything, I don't need to see it in graphic detail.
L:  Right.  I know.  Well, I know growing up, ah, we had -- I lived on the border of Virginia and North Carolina, um, so I'm kind of in the same boat that you are.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But, I was more on -- in the north east corner of North Carolina and I got a lot of Virginia news and there was a lot more happening in -- in the Norfolk, Virginia Beach area than there was in my little hokey poke town in north east North Carolina, you know?  And, um --  
R:  I mean, I do get the paper.  I get the newspaper from my neighbour.  So, when my neighbor's done with our local paper, which we pick up, um -- Brunswick County and South Hill paper -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I do -- I -- I mean, it -- it may be a week behind or it might be two weeks behind but I still have an idea what's going on in my county.
L:  Right.
R:  It doesn't ha- -- I mean, the paper's all of four pages.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean -- 
L:  So -- 
R:  -- what can happen in four pages?  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] So, in home schooling, ah, I guess you have to do a little bit of, ah, social studies type stuff, ah, to expose them to world events and current events but so you use the articles from the newspaper to integrate that in your -- in your teaching?
R:  Yes.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  Wow.  So -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- how did they handle the news of the war?
R:  Well, they did find, you know, it -- it got to the point where one would worry more than the other.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you know, the six year old can't comprehend -- well, he -- he -- you know, the six year old can but not to the degree of the fifteen year old.
L:  Right.
R:  So, um, I guess I would say she took it a little differently than he did.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, we just talked about it and then, you know, we're -- we're involved in something at church where the kids have a [inaudible] and they have to pray for, um, somebody -- a service member.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Now, I wouldn't have done it that way.  But, that's the way they do it so for me it was like I don't feel that my kids need to know about the war but -- and other than the [inaudible], you know -- there's so much.  It's hard for me to explain.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.  Ah, ah, now that the world is changed because of the Trade Center, at one point [SIGH] I didn't feel my children needed to know about war and I still don't feel that they need to know everything because they need to have a childhood.
L:  Right.
R:  But -- 
L:  I don't know, but then that's a true test of your faith of how to desensitize all that and so, you know, who's in control -- 
R:  God.
L:  -- ultimately -- 
R:  God.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] That's right.  And that if they truly believe that and count on that then he's going to take care of -- of it all in the end, you know?  I -- the way I look at it, we're just here temporary anyway.  Um, [SIGH] I don't know, I've told my kids a lot more than I probably knew growing up but on the other hand I try and balance that with my faith and that -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- um -- 
R:  Everything's all in God's time.
L:  That's right.
R:  God is always in con- -- in control.  Even though we might like to be in control, God is the one in the ultimate control.
L:  Right.  And he was there during all those bombings and all those deaths and crying right along with us as we -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- we watched it.  So, um, I don't know.  I -- I like to have the information but I do get it on overload if I take in too much.  So, I -- I have to be careful about that myself.
R:  Yeah.  That's why -- that's why I don't like to have the -- the TV on for news because -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then it's, like, [MN] either -- either you get too glued to it and too connected to it or for me I -- I just need the weather.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean -- 
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- I don't [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  I don't know -- I'm sorry, but I don't need everything else.  Um, I'm concerned about what President Bush has to say because I find him one of the -- a good president like Washington who was a Godly man.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, on the other hand I really don't feel I need to know who murdered who and who's hanging who and -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't need that.
L:  I know.  I know.
R:  I mean, for me I don't believe in man's law, I believe in God's law.
L:  Right.
R:  'Cause man's law never -- very rarely takes care of those that done something wrong.
L:  It's not true justice.  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's right. 
L:  Mhm -- 
R:  That's right.
L:  Well, I'm with ya.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I listen to a lot of Christian radio and, um, classical.  You know, easy listening, um, jazz kind of things for background, you know, when I'm cleaning or, you know, writing bills and that sort of thing.  But -- 
R:  Yeah, I have mine on so that I -- so that I can be aware of -- you know, living in the south you have no idea what the weather's going to be.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Well, that's right and with the weather like it's been lately [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- tornados popping up and floods and everything else, you know, you got to be ready.  Mm.
R:  So, you know, I'm not used to torn- tornados.  Af- after last year we had one that was like only [SIGH] two hundred fifty feet away from the house.
L:  Good grief.
R:  When you could hear the freight train and the hail's coming and you're new to it -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it's like, "Okay --"
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- where do I go?"  [LAUGH] --" 
L:  Yeah, that's right.
R:  I'm standing at the front door still --
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- listening and they tell me, "No, you weren't supposed to do that".  [LAUGH] I said, "I'm sorry, I just want to".  Now I know where to go.  [LAUGH] --  
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  I don't have a basement so I take my kids in my bathroom.  It's got a big sunk in tub and that's where we go.
L:  So, where did you get that information?  On the radio, TV or -- or what?
R:  Well, I got it on a little bit of both.  Radio and the TV.  Mostly it was the television.  That was not where you need to be standing -- 
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- at the door watching.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Oh, no.
R:  And a couple of -- a couple of my neighbors at church said, "That's not where you need to --" 
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- go Kim".  I said, "Well, what is --
