R:  Hi, I'm -- I'm Shirley.
L:  Hi, I'm Jean.  How are you?
R:  I am fine.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, [MN] well, I'm talking to a woman this time.  That's good because we've probably got more in common [LAUGH].
L:  Okay.
R:  Men like the fighting games, you know.  Uh, what kind of computer games do you usually play?
L:  You know, I don't really have time to do -- I have two small kids.  The only kind of games I do are the games with them on the computer like, uh, -- you know they have different games like they're matching things or kind of more educational things [NOISE] 'cause my kids are little but as far as me playing any games for me, I don't have time [LAUGH].  
R:  They would probably --
L:  I wish I did.
R:  They would probably like the word games.  If you ever -- oh, you could go to www dot pogo dot com --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- they have what they call word whomp.
L:  Uh-huh.  I haven't heard of that.
R:  Uh-huh and it's all -- all of them are six, uh, letter words so it's not difficult words --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to figure out but it's fun and it would probably be fun to the children.  I play it a lot.
L:  I know, it does sound -- my -- my son likes to play sometimes Hangman.  You know that old -- you know, just on a piece of paper so I'm sure he would like that.
R:  Oh, he'd love Kangaroo.
L:  Now, what is that?
R:  That's [MN] well, he's gets kinda insulting a little bit but [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but he's a kangaroo and he, um, like if you -- you -- you have like it'll say a, um, uh, famous quote for instance.
L:  Okay.
R:  Like give me liberty to give me death and then you've got to come up with, uh, the letters.  You mash on the letter and if it's not up there the kangaroo will say, "Oh, no", you know.
L:  Oh, that sounds neat.  Now, where is that at?
R:  Uh, I don't know.  I have it.
L:  Okay.  Like I was going to ask you how do you find out about these different [NOISE] games or ...?
R:  If you want -- if -- if you don't mind giving me your email address, I'll send it to you.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  What is it [LAUGH]?
L:  It's J.N. --
R:  J.N.
L:  -- and then L.M.N. --
R:  L.E.M.?
L:  M.  M like Mark.
R:  But is it L.M.?
L:  L.M.N.
R:  Oh, wait a minute.  I've done got confused.  J.N.L. ...
L:  M.N.
R:  M.N., okay.
L:  At aol dot com.
R:  At aol dot com.
L:  I think.
R:  Oh, I play that all the time but he does --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  You know, he'll say, "You can spell, can't you?"
L:  Oh, that's funny.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  My kids will get a kick out of that.
R:  And then whenever you don't get the, um, word right, it hangs him so he comes -- he -- he goes [MN] and -- and hangs --
L:  Oh, that sounds neat.
R:  Then he comes back up and he's blue and he -- he's got his hands folded like he's mad at you.  You know, he's looking mad like, "You killed me" [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, really?
R:  So, it's --
L:  Oh, that sounds neat.
R:  Uh, it's fun.  It's really fun and kids like it.  So, it's J.N.L.M.N. at aol.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Okay.  I'll send you that one so the kids can play with it --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- because they really love it but my favorite on the computer is, um -- and it's at that pogo -- www pogo --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- com is, um, I play a lot of, uh, bingo.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I love the bingo and then I play spades.  You can play spades.
L:  Oh, that's neat.
R:  Yeah.  You play with the computer.  I don't go into the rooms.  There's about thirty rooms.
L:  So, you can play against people.
R:  I don't like to play against people --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so I just play against the computer because, you know, sometimes --
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  You know how that goes --
L:  I know.  I know.
R:  -- you've got to get involved [LAUGH]
L:  I'm not into -- I'm into my privacy [LAUGH].
R:  It's -- yeah, well it's kinda like me.  I don't go in the chat rooms.  I don't --
L:  Right, I don't either.  I don't -- yeah.
R:  So -- so you can -- any game on pogo you can play with, uh --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- someone else or you can play it alone.
L:  Okay [NOISE]
R:  And I play it alone.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, you'd probably enjoy that if you ever get a chance --
L:  Right [LAUGH]
R:  -- especially with children.  No, mine are grown.  I'm fifty three years old so mine are grown so I have some time that I can spend at night when --
L:  Right.
R:  -- everything's quiet to do that.
L:  Right.
R:  But with children, mhm, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- no way.  You -- if you're like, you're going in five hundred different directions --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- at one time.  I told my husband when my children were in different things, I said, "I past myself during the day today" and that's about how you feel, you pass yourself on the road.
L:  That's a good, um [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] He's said, "What did you do --"
L:  -- way to say it.
R:  Yeah, he said, "What did you do?" I said, "I just waved and kept on going" [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's funny.
R:  But, um, the best one -- I guess Kangaroo is -- is my favorite.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, uh, because I just love to do, uh, games -- you know, I mean, I love to do --
L:  Right.
R:  -- words.
L:  It is fun.
R:  Mhm, and try to --
L:  Trying to keep -- try to keep you sharp, yeah.
R:  Of course, some of them -- I don't know if -- if you -- if I send you this, you'll probably be able to go on their website and they may have an easier one, an easier Kangaroo for the kids.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Sometimes this gets, you know, capital of some continent or something like that [LAUGH] --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- that they may not know but it may have an easier one for them.
L:  Right.
R:  And different levels I guess is what I'm trying to say.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Maybe you can find one that would have, uh, uh --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- what they'd like but you -- you'd probably like it too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You'd enjoy it --
L:  Sounds neat.
R:  -- if you get a chance to -- so you probably learn from them, don't you?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  And you -- when you --
L:  Very much.  The stuff my -- my son is learning in first grade is unbelievable.  I just -- I'm like, "Okay, in a couple of years, you're past me" [LAUGH].
R:  And that's the truth.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's the truth and --
L:  And they are more, um -- I think they're more -- they're -- they're used to doing stuff on the computer, you know what I mean?  Because they've always done it.
R:  That's right.  Started out from the beginning when it --
L:  Yeah, so they're very comfortable.  They're sort of not intimidated.
R:  Well, see it's the new process for our brain to process --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and do these things on the computer.  My -- my mother, she wouldn't even fool with it.  She says, "Oh, I done got too old.  I'm not gonna learn".  So, you have to just be willing to --
L:  Yeah [NOISE]
R:  -- to -- to do it.  But d- do they have educational, uh, uh, things on the computer --
L:  You know --
R:  -- games and things.
L:  -- well they have a lot of different websites like, um, -- that's okay --they have a lot of different things like my kids watch these programs on Nickelodeon [MN] like Blues Clues and, um, some of these other ones and they you can go on there and -- and they'll load different games where they might have like, you know how like that old concentration or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- where -- where you're matching --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then the kid can just do it on the computer and say, "A match" or whatever.  What --
R:  Right, that's educational.
L:  Some of -- yeah, but some of them get a little bit --
R:  Too complicated.
L:  -- redundant.  Sometimes after you've got it or they'll have like you know, let's pick up.  You're helping him go shopping or something.  You're picked something out.  Just little -- just really, um -- it just kinda gets them used to even too just moving the mouse around, you know, or you help somebody get dressed or you do this or some of them, the ones that came, um, when I bought my computer, like, two years ago, they came with some disk and we haven't done that too much because we were supposed to find stuff and go from room to room.  I couldn't even find the stuff.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I could not even find the stuff.  I was like, "Okay let's [LAUGH] --"
R:  You might find --
L:  "Let's get something different in here" [LAUGH].
R:  You might find if you leave them to their devices they'll find it though.
L:  Find it themselves, right --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- exactly.  I was just like "Wow".
R:  But, you know, I -- I want to tell you about this Kangaroo.  It takes a few seconds for it to, uh, upload.
L:  Yeah, they all do, yeah.
R:  Yeah, and so if you're sitting there with a screen and say, "Well, gee it's not doing anything" give it a few minutes.  It'll pop that Kangaroo up.
L:  Yeah, we're used to that.  Some -- that some of the games they have on Nickelodeon when you're waiting to load the thing in, [MN] they have you pretend like you're the dog and that you're catching the ball and then the kid can get used to moving around the, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the -- the mouse or whatever.
R:  You have to give it a time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess if we had that, oh, I don't -- I don't have that -- all cable dial up.  If we had that, maybe it'd go faster but --
L:  Yeah, I don't either.  I'm not gonna pay for that.
R:  I'm not.  Well, no because --
L:  You know, it's fast enough for me.
R:  Basically I just do jobs on it or either I'll, uh, do -- I'll search for something or something like that --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- so I don't mind waiting.
L:  Yeah, it is handy some of the things that you could do that you didn't used to be able to do but it does -- you sit down and the time just goes.
R:  You work too?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.  See, you have to think about -- I did when I -- I don't work now and I -- I'm backward.  I worked then when I shouldn't have and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and now [LAUGH].
L:  You've probably worked enough [LAUGH].
R:  I guess [LAUGH]. I need a break.
L:  That's how I feel.  I've worked enough.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know.
R:  But, um, uh, how -- how old is your children?
L:  Uh, seven and four.
R:  So, they're at the right age to really get into these computer games.
L:  Yeah, they are.  They really -- yeah.
R:  Do you have a son and daughter?
L:  Two -- two sons.
R:  They're getting into fight games too probably, don't they?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  'Cause they'll like those Spiderman --
L:  Right, right.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  Not very educational but it keeps the brain alert.
L:  Well -- well, yeah but not everything has to be -- you know, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- let's have some fun.
R:  Oh, well that's the way I feel.
L:  Yeah [MN] [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I feel like y- y- y- you become an adult quick enough and get --
L:  Right, I know and especially nowadays the kids are supposed to learn all -- too much stuff, you know.
R:  Too -- too quickly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Much too quickly.
R:  But I hope that, um, your children enjoys that Kangaroo when I send it through.
L:  Oh, I'm sure they will.
R:  They, uh --
L:  I'm sure they will.
R:  Like I say, just let me -- and -- and I feel like they -- once I send it to you, then I'll allow you to get onto the website and then -- then you can choose something appropriate for their age.
L:  Okay, okay.
R:  'Cause mine is -- is more difficult.  The one that I send you will be more difficult.  Something -- oh, names of books, names of movies, things like that is more or less what is there.  Sometimes countries or animals or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- dinosaurs.
L:  Oh, that's neat.
R:  Different dinosaurs, what -- you know, what --
L:  Now, [NOISE] my son could probably name more than I could on --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- dino- dinosaurs.
R:  I get it -- and I -- I -- it gets me every time on them dinosaurs.
L:  [MN]
R:  I just --
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  I don't think I'm, uh -- but I know my son knows them.
R:  Uh-huh.  I'll -- I'll think it's -- it should have a P in it and it -- and it ends up having a V in it, you know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- like +tyrannosaur --
L:  Right [NOISE].
R:  And I say, "Oh, man, I'm no ...
