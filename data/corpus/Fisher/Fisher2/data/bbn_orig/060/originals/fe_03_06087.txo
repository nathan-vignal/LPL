R:  Hi, my -- 
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  My name is Lynetta[?].
L:  Hi.  What is your name, I'm sorry?
R:  Lynetta.
L:  Lynetta.  My name's Alisa.
R:  Oh, hi.  How are you?
L:  Hi, I'm fine.  How are you?
R:  I'm fine.
L:  [LAUGH] Um, so do you play computer games?
R:  Ah, yes I do.
L:  Oh, okay -- 
R:  Um [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] I don't.  I just -- I -- when I was younger my parents had Tetris on the computer and I would play that but that's pretty much the last time.  What -- what do you play?
R:  Ah, basically I play, ah, Solitaire and, ah, I go into the Yahoo chat room and I'll play a couple of games of Pool but I'm not that good at Pool.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But, ah, basically it's just, ah, like the card game Solitaire, Hearts, things like that, ah, that I basically play on the computer which -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah, it's downloaded on my computer so I'm not really on the internet that much.
L:  Okay.  How do you -- how do they -- how do you play Pool?
R:  Ah -- 
L:  On line -- 
R:  -- what, ah -- 
L:  -- or on the computer.
R:  On the, ah, Yahoo, um, messenger screen where they have the games and stuff -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you just go in and click on games and it'll give you the list of, ah, games that they have and you select the one that you want.  So, for instance, if it's Pool and there are other people from other areas of the country that are in those particular chat rooms and, ah, you just, ah, select the forum that you want to go into and it'll let you in and it'll give you the list of names of, ah, the people, you know, that are in the chat room that are actually playing Pool and, um, you just click with the mouse, ah, with the pool stick, ah, kind of drag it and click to hit the balls 'cause the pool table itself is set up just like a normal pool table with the balls and the eight balls and everything and -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- you just kind of drag your mouse and click it and it'll, you know, kind of pull back and shoot the ball just as if you physically had the pool stick in your hand -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- to shoot the ball.  So, it's a lot of fun 'cause you get a chance to interact with other people and, ah, a lot of times you can get back into the same chat room that, you know, you previously played with other people and then sometimes if that one's full then you'll, ah, get bumped into another chat room but the game itself is basically the same.
L:  So, you just play another person.
R:  Yes, exactly. 
L:  Okay.
R:  Ah, sometimes there's only two people playing.  Sometimes there -- there's four and sometimes there's six.  It just depends on what chat room you end up in as to how many physical players are in that particular chat room.
L:  Now, how could you do it with six people?
R:  Ah, basically what -- what you actually do is with the six, ah, six people it's kind of like a team thing so it's like three on one team and three on the other so each person, ah, for each team gets a chance or an opportunity to shoot.
L:  Okay.
R:  And, um, then, ah, you determine, like, ah, from each team -- um, the first person that goes determines whether you have the high balls or the low balls and, ah, then you just take your turn -- your turns at, ah, shooting the ball.
L:  Okay.  Well, that -- 
R:  So, I mean -- 
L:  -- sounds fun.
R:  -- it's interesting and it gives you an opportunity to, you know, meet some people also.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, but I don't spend a whole lot of time in there, it's just a lot of times if I'm not on the net I'll go in and play maybe one or two games and, ah, but basically it's just maybe Solitaire or Hearts that I play actually -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- on the computer.
L:  Well, that doesn't sound bad.  I just, um, I used to date someone actually who had, um, [MN] l- like this X. box. 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it was a -- this ridiculous war game and he would, like -- he was playing it, like, every single night and like, would talk about it all the time and -- 
R:  Oh, my goodness.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  -- always try to get me to play it and it was like, "I'm not interested in playing this game.  Like, let's go to dinner or something".
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But, um, you know, so, that was kind of a bad experience and -- and when I found, um, when I was playing Tetris -- have you ever played that?
R:  No, I haven't.
L:  It's kind of like, um, [MN] you -- these different shapes fall down, ah, from the top of the screen to the bottom of the screen and they settle on the bottom and you have -- as it's falling you have the power to maneuver it to make sure that it will fit like a puzzle piece in with the other pieces that have already fallen -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- at the bottom.  And, ah, it's -- it's fairly -- fairly simple but, um, what I found with that -- and it's kind of like Solitaire in the sense that you just play by yourself.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, I found that I was, like -- I'd sit there and play for like an hour and I would, like, just think about it when I wasn't playing.  [LAUGH]  
R:  Oh, my goodness.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  So, it's kind of like an addictive game.  So -- 
R:  Oh, okay -- 
L:  I just don't like 'em 'cause of that.
R:  Yeah, ah, 'cause there was a website.  Ah, it's probably still out there.  I was just kind of searching one day and, ah, there was -- I -- I -- it was some kind of game that you played and, um, um, there were like a group of monkeys or something and they were dropping, um, I guess from a mountain or whatever and you would try and catch it before it got to the bottom, ah, of the screen.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it would not always fall, you know, like in the same spot or whatever.  So, you know, you'd have your mouse kind of dragging a- -- dragging it trying to catch him and, um, then at the end of the game, ah, how it -- it calculated your winning according to how many -- kind of like, I guess, Pacman sort of kind of thing.  You know how it eats up the little Pacmans or whatever?
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  Ah, it -- but this one was with the monkeys or whatever and I played Pacman once or twice on the internet but it -- it's really not as fun playing it like on the Atari and Nintendo.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It -- 'cause it's a little bit different and you have a little bit more problem trying to drag the mouse to kind of get ahead of the little Pacman.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I think it would -- 'cause you don't have, like, that joystick or -- 
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.
L:  -- whatever.  Yeah.
R:  Exactly. 
L:  [SIGH] Well, yeah, and I -- I -- I guess I've played Solitaire too.  I used to, um, be in, ah, like a secretary.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And there was just a lot of down time in that job so I would -- I would definitely play Solitaire sometimes with just sitting at my desk, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, it was good -- it was a good, like, time filler.
R:  Yeah, it would.  That it definitely is 'cause a lot of times I'll start playing and, ah, I get so caught up in it 'til I look at the clock and two or three hours have passed and I'm like, "Oh, my goodness" -- 
L:  Oh, no.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I didn't realise I had been playing, ah, that long, ah, 'cause, um, one of my nephews had downloaded, um -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- it's Solitaire but it's called Spider Solitaire and it's a little bit more complicated than just the regular Solitaire and it's so funny because it's kind of -- it's not as easy to win as the normal Solitaire is and I'm like, "Oh, I'm going to play one more game.  I know I can win --" 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- one more game".  And one --" 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- more game usually turns into ten or fifteen.  So -- 
L:  Yeah.  And then you -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I -- that -- yeah, definitely.  I mean, they are fun but they can be addictive, you know?
R:  Exactly.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Exactly.  So, what area, ah, do you live in?
L:  I'm in Boston.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm in Houston -- 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- Texas.  Yeah.
L:  How -- what's the weather like down there?  Do -- 
R:  Oh, hot.
L:  -- will you expect the [inaudible] of the storm -- 
R:  It -- oh, very, very hot.  Um -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it's been like in the low eighties to nineties, but the humidity is real, real bad here.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, it really -- even though it's ninety it feels like it's maybe like ninety five, ninety eight degrees.  So -- 
L:  Oh.  [SIGH] 
R:  -- we've just basically been in with the air conditioner.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Well, that's nice that you have that.  Up here, um, it's -- we're just so sick of the cold.  Yesterday I think it was, like, in the -- it was like fifty degrees --  
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- you know it -- it's almost June here, you know, and we're -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a little bit depressed [LAUGH] that it's not warmer -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- yet.
R:  Well, I think we'd -- we'd love for it to come this way [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- 'cause it's been so hot here.
L:  Yeah -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it's tough.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I don't know how much of [several inaudible words] we can talk about for ten minutes.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] I know, is this -- how -- what was your last conversation about?
R:  Ah, well this is the first one that I've had.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.  This is the very first one that I, ah, had, ah, matter of fact I kind of just stumbled on to, um, the website to sign up for it and I was kind of like, "Oh, this should be interesting" and, um, then I got an email the other day saying, you know, that, ah, they had confirmed me signing up and you know, that I would be getting a call, um, in the next couple of days.  So, this is very -- you know, the very first one that I've done.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  Ah, so how many so far -- what have you basically -- 
L:  Well -- 
R:  -- talked about?
L:  This is my second one.  The first one was about -- um, the question was if you could -- if -- if you could make a million dollars to move to a different country, would you do that?  But, the only exception was that you could never come back.
R:  Oh, my goodness.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  So, yeah, it was just a debate on whether or not you would do that.
R:  Oh.
L:  But, I think that -- I think the computer has tried to call me a couple of times but -- since then, and I haven't been home.  So -- 
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay, yeah, 'cause when I, ah, first got it I thought it was a telemarketer at first and I was like, "Okay, okay.  You better listen".
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
