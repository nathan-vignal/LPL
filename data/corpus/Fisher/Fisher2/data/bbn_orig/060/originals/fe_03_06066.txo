L:  Hi.  Good day.  My name is Ambi.
R:  Hi, this is Tammy.
L:  Tammy, how are you?
R:  Okay, thank you.  I hope you're having a good night [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  How about you?
R:  Okay [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] So, what -- what's the last movie you're seeing?  Do you like to stay home, do you like to go out or what?
R:  Well, we just saw Bringing Down the House.
L:  Bring- oh, that was excellent.  That was so cool [LAUGH].
R:  Very funny I thought.
L:  Yeah, a riot.
R:  And, uh, I thought -- like I usually -- I'm not into comedies that much usually --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but that one was particularly good.  We went on Mother's Day --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and it turned out to be a good movie with my Mum and my nieces and [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- everybody enjoyed it.
L:  Yes.  I love comedy [LAUGH].
R:  Really?
L:  So what do you -- what category do you like -- um, prefer?
R:  You know, I'm not even sure but sometimes the comedies are so stupid that [LAUGH] --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I don't know --
L:  I'm saying what kind of movies do you find yourself looking at most of the time?
R:  Well, I guess because I go with my husband and we end up -- our compromise is like suspenseful ones [LAUGH].
L:  Okay.
R:  'Cause I probably would like the mushy ones [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And he would probably like all the shoot 'em up, bang, bang.
L:  [LAUGH] Okay, so I -- I see.  I -- I take it that you've seen, um, X Men.
R:  Oh, of course.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I like -- that was cool.  That was really good.
R:  I was surprised --
L:  Um --
R:  -- I liked that.
L:  -- have -- have you seen Matrix yet?
R:  No, we didn't see that.
L:  Yeah, I wanna see that.
R:  We haven't even seen the first one so ...
L:  Okay.
R:  Haven't seen the second one definitely --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, uh --
L:  What -- oh, now do you -- do you like Eddie Murphy movies?  He had one called Daddy Day- Daddy Daycare, whatever.
R:  We didn't see that yet.  That was gonna be our other choice if we couldn't get -- if Bringing Down the House was already out [LAUGH].
L:  Okay, okay.
R:  But we didn't get to see that but it does look like it would be cute [LAUGH].
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Maybe too cute [LAUGH].  I don't know.  All those little kids everywhere.
L:  They have, uh, one called Charlie's -- the Charlie's Angels come out.  Another Charlie's Angles coming out.
R:  Mhm.
L:  The first one was really, really different.  I liked it.
R:  I liked that also.
L:  Did -- you seen it?
R:  The first one?
L:  Yes.
R:  Not this new one [LAUGH] --
L:  Right, it' --
R:  -- because I --
L:  -- in the way it opened up and when they were on a airplane and everything --
R:  Yeah, that --
L:  -- and -- and -- and the fact that that wasn't really LL Cool J.  That was one of the Charlie's Angels.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  All the special effects were so cool.
R:  Yeah, I did like that movie though.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, uh, I'm trying to think what else we saw.  Some movies called Identity recently.
L:  Mhm.  Was that good?
R:  It was different.
L:  Okay. 
R:  It was really different like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't know if you're gonna see it so I don't want to spoil the plot [LAUGH].
L:  I -- I wouldn't.  I -- I hadn't planned on seeing it.
R:  well, it was one of those movies that --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you just didn't know what was going on.  We thought it was murder in this motel --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then the next thing you now, everything was in this guy's mind.  It wasn't really happening [LAUGH].
L:  Wow.
R:  Every- all the characters were a different personality --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in his head [LAUGH] so that was -- it was a really odd movie but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- kinda had a twist to it.
L:  What about Destination two? It's like they're, like, these characters like accidental prone.
R:  Yeah, we saw that.
L:  W- w- was that good, cause I never did get a chance to see it?
R:  It's gory [LAUGH].
L:  It was what?
R:  It's gory.  It's got a lot of gore in it but, I don't know, we liked the first one and second one [LAUGH].
L:  Okay.
R: I don't -- apparently nobody else liked the second one though 'cause it was only at the theater like a week and then just --
L:  Right, it -- yes, it didn't stay long.
R:  No.
L:  I guess it didn't sell well.  I didn't even know it was a -- number one.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Didn't know a Destination one.
R:  It had, uh -- there was this, um, car accident at the very beginning of it that makes you just not wanna go out in your car [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.
R:  Make you really, really paranoid.  So, I take it you go out to the movies a lot, not --
L:  Yes, definitely.  And if I don't, um, see it at the movies, I, you know, rent the DVDs and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- watch it at home.  It's pretty cool 'cause I got the DVD and the stereo theatrical sounds, uh, speakers [LAUGH].
R:  Wow, that sounds nice.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We don't rent movies that often because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- usually I don't know, a lot on TV but we did, we just rented one tonight as a matter of fact but we don't usually [LAUGH].
L:  What is that tonight, did you, um, rent?
R:  Uh, it was husband's choice [LAUGH].  It was Clint Eastwood.  Blood Work I think it was called.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I had never even heard of it before.
L:  You like, uh, Harry -- any of Harry Potter's movies?
R:  I haven't seen 'em.
L:  Okay.  What about, uh, I don't know, there's this movie called Hot Chick.  I loved it.
R:  No.
L:  It was supposed to be a comedy.
R:  That's the one with --
L:  A lady walks into this guy's body --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I didn't see that one either [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We, uh --
L:  But where are you from?
R:  I'm in, uh, Lake Forest area.
L:  Lake Forest?
R:  Mhm, where are you?
L:  That Virginia?
R:  Oh, no.  I'm -- everybody I've always talked to is in North Carolina so I just --
L:  Okay, North Carolina.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm from Washington DC.
R:  Okay, not too far then.
L:  Okay.
R:  Huh.  Everybody -- I thought they were trying to match you up with North Carolina all the time, me.
L:  Okay.
R:  So ...
L:  Right.
R:  I can't even think of -- oh, we're trying to stay on these topic things and I can't think of any other movies lately.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We went through a lot of 'em real quick.
L:  I --I -- I pl- I'm gonna probably go see the Matrix tomorrow and, um, Daddy Daycare.
R:  Oh.  I wish I knew whether that one was good or not [LAUGH].  The Matrix I think we'd have to skip until we see the first one [LAUGH].
L:  Okay, yeah.  You probably want to see the first one.
R:  But ...
L:  The X Men was really cool.  I [LAUGH] -- would you send your child to a -- if you had, like, a real mysterious or intuitive child or different, would you send them to a school like that?
R:  [LAUGH] Mhm.
L:  Mhm [LAUGH].
R:  I don't know about that [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't have any kids yet so [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I don't know [LAUGH] but that was pretty neat.  I have to say that Bringing down the House was probably one of the best movies I've seen lately.  I --
L:  It was so funny.
R:  The theater was just -- I mean we had a good audience too and I think that helps.
L:  Mhm.  Yes --
R:  Like everybody was --
L:  -- it does.
R:  -- just hysterical and [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they really made it fun --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because it's hard to take someone like my mother, someone that's -- a whole bunch of -- of different generations.  That's what I'm trying to spit out here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that everybody enjoyed it [LAUGH].
L:  Exactly.
R:  It was really cute.
L:  Mhm.  I normally go to the movies during the day when hardly anyone is there but when I went to go see X Men it was, like, in the evening.  It was totally crowded and I was so -- you know, felt so funny because I wasn't used to so many people being in the theater.
R:  Oh.  That -- I love going to scary movies when the theater's full.  That's the only time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Any other time I'd rather have it, you know, just hardly anybody but when it's a scary movie it's really fun to have people that are screaming and [LAUGH] --
L:  Exactly.
R:  That makes it neat.
L:  Well, you like, um -- what's the name of that?  I think it's called Scary Movie.  The Scary Movie.  
R:  Yeah, they're funny [LAUGH].
L:  One, two, three.  Yeah, it's different too and they were really funny.  Uh, I think they have another one coming out.
R:  I don't -- haven't seen it yet or seen anything advertised about it.  I don't know.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Hm.
L:  There's another one coming out.  Uh, I think it's Scary Movie three or something like that.
R:  Yeah, like I -- I think we've pretty much seen -- we even went to the Halloween movie which was not very good [LAUGH].  The last one, and we went to the last, like, um, Friday the thirteenth one.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But if it wasn't for, like I said, the audiences really make a big difference --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because some of the movies end up being so cheesy [LAUGH].
L:  [COUGH] I didn't really care for horror movies until Scary Movie came out 'cause it -- it -- it opens up so differently and it -- it builds with -- you know, they interact with the characters more realistically like we --
R:  Right.
L:  -- we can relate --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- more so than running through the forest with their heels on --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [LAUGH] having you know, the normal plot for scary movies like Jason and ...
R:  Yeah, some of them get pretty crazy.  I don't know what you'd think about Final Destination then [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because it's pretty far fetched but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so it has -- I like it whenever they have twists and it had some twists in that movie.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I don't think they're going to be up for any awards for the acting [LAUGH] in them.
L:  Right.  I really need to see that.
R:  I think my -- we always joke my husband and I that if something does get an award, we probably won't like that movie because we just -- I don't know, we must not get it [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We're not sophisticated enough or something [LAUGH].
L:  Exactly.
R:  Because we saw About Schmidt with Jack Nicholson and we thought that was really depressing and slow and [LAUGH] ...
L:  Oh, I can't stand slow movies.  Oh, that really tears me up.
R:  Oh, that one we rented tonight was real slow.  I was starting to fall asleep.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, gee I wasn't sure we'd get anybody on the east coast with a time zone this late at night.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I actually, uh, I've been trying to tell different people about calling and they all just think it's -- I'm crazy whenever I tell them [LAUGH].
L:  Right.
R:  So, I'm getting off topic here but [LAUGH] --
L:  Our time is probably up any second anyway so [LAUGH] ...
R:  Oh, I didn't even notice.
L:  It was nice talking to you, Tammy.  She'll probably come up on it any second now.
R:  Oh, I gotta start watching the clock.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, this is my third phone call so I guess this'll be it for me [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, same here.
R:  Oh, okay.  The first one was really strange [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, I had to get used to it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I'll probably just refer people, I don't know.
R:  Well, I don't even know -- um, it seems like they just want men now [LAUGH].
L:  Yes, exactly.  The lady said that.
R:  Yeah, go figure.  They can't find men that wanna talk [LAUGH].
L:  That is so true.
R:  Not like that's typical for a man not to talk [LAUGH].
L:  Over the phone though I don't think they like to talk.
R:  No.  That's what I've been trying to tell my husband and he's like, "I don't want to talk to a stranger for ten minutes" [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Yes.
R:  He's not too crazy about talking to me for ten minutes straight I don't think [LAUGH].
