R:  I play -- 
L:  I don't really play games.
R:  -- this is a -- not easy topic.
L:  No, it's not.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Um, I play Dominos.  I play Pogo games like, um, Word Wop, ah --  
L:  What's that?
R:  -- Tumble Bees and I have, um, a Scrabble CD rom and Monopoly CD rom game.

R:  Ah -- 
L:  Any of those -- 
R:  No, I, um -- 
L:  -- [inaudible] 
R:  -- mm mm.  The main one I play is Dominos.  If I feel like -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- interacting.  The other one, um, Tumble Bees is where you just make -- um, they give you like a group of letters that's constantly falling and you -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- have to make words.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And -- But no, that's Word Wop and then the other one is, um, you just pop matching balloons.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.  I -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- call them mindless games because I don't have to think when I'm doing it, it's just something that -- 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know, keep me -- keep me busy.  I work with mentally ill adults.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And, um, at the end of the day I can sign on line and -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and take my phone off the hook and -- 
L:  There you go.
R:  -- not have any interaction and -- and do nothing -- that's my, you know, my nothing games.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, so -- 
L:  You play Solitaire?
R:  Ah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And that's the one on the hard drive.
L:  Yeah.
R:  FreeCell and, um, playing Solitaire, Hearts.  I do have this game called Dope Wars that I play.
L:  What is -- 
R:  That -- 
L:  -- that -- 
R:  [LAUGH] It's -- like, it's not a very scrupulous game.  You sell drugs.

R:  [LAUGH] And it's -- 
L:  Well [LAUGH] yeah, tell me about it?  Okay, so do you -- how did -- did you buy that?  Is it on CD rom or -- 
R:  No, you can download it.  Go to Dope Wars. 
L:  Okay -- 
R:  And, um -- 
L:  -- dope wars dot com. 
R:  -- you just -- you're a drug dealer.  You fly from country to country -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and you buy and sell drugs.  You, um, have to go by the store and, um -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- get weapons.
L:  Uh-huh -- 
R:  [LAUGH] You know?  I always get a big gun with a lot -- with a lot of bullets.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, you -- when you get shot you can go to the doctor and -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- sometime a doct- -- [pause] -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, yeah, that one's fun.  I have -- 
L:  That's cool.
R:  -- a nine year old.  She doesn't -- she doesn't get to meet -- see me playing that one.  But it is -- 
L:  You can -- 
R:  -- really fun.
L:  -- you can just download it off of the -- off of the internet?  You -- 
R:  Ah -- 
L:  -- just go to dope wars dot com.
R:  Yep.
L:  Cool.
R:  Yeah, and -- 
L:  I have to check that out.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Now, as I think about it -- and I -- I have another.  It's called D.X. Ball.
L:  What's that?
R:  It's, um, it's a little ball that you have.  You -- it's a paddle and a ball hits the paddle and it goes up and hits these little squares and they disappear.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And it gets progressively harder.
L:  Uh-huh -- 
R:  Yeah, I'm, ah, thirty two so [LAUGH] you know?
L:  [LAUGH] Do you get bored with the games after a while?  Like -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- do you play -- do you quit play -- playing it after a while?
R:  Yeah, that's why I have so many.  I didn't realise -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I was -- I had so many games I play until I'm -- I'm having this conversation.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah -- 
R:  So, and I have the classic Arcade game that I bought, and -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, my daughter was telling me today she bought, um, Pacman for X. Box.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Which is totally different from the Pacman that I play on my classic Arcade.
L:  Oh, I know.  Yeah -- 
R:  Yeah.  Mhm -- 
L:  Yeah.  I used to play Pacman a lot.  I miss Pacman and stuff.
R:  How old are you?
L:  Ah, twenty five.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  How old are you?
R:  Thirty two, so -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- but I -- when we used to go to the arcade -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it was not Dave and Busters.  I don't know if -- if you've ever heard of Dave and Busters.
L:  Ahah.
R:  It's this adult arcade place up here.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it's -- a lot of the games, are like virtual reality games.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  Ah, if you're driving car you can feel it moving and -- and they video tape you.  Yes.
L:  Mm.
R:  It's like a camera.  Everybody can see your expressions as you --
L:  Oh, really?  I wouldn't -- 
R:  -- drive.  Y- yeah.
L:  -- like that I don't think.
R:  Mm, you would love it.
L:  Really?
R:  Mhm.  They have a bar there. You can order food.  You can play pool.  It's huge.
L:  Cool.
R:  It's about the size of, um, a super Walmart.

R:  And [inaudible] it's for adults.
L:  Whoa, that's cool.  What's -- 
R:  Yeah, you would like it.

R:  It's -- it's a hangout.
L:  Cool.
R:  Mhm.
L:  What's it called again?
R:  Dave and Busters.  If you ever --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- come to Atlanta, tell your friends to take you there -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and after a couple of margaritas, um -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, playing a -- a boxing game you'll be sweaty and tired.  
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.  Your go.  You say -- 
L:  Cool.
R:  -- I talk about -- so this is easy for me.
L:  Yeah, no, this is good 'cause I don't -- I don't really play computer games that much, so [LAUGH] --  
R:  Oh.
L:  'Cause, yeah, I don't know.  I play -- I -- I mean, I'll play, like, Solitaire and stuff but -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's about it so it's -- it's kind of a tough topic.  But -- but I like Atlanta though.  I got some friends who live in Atlanta.
R:  Mhm.  Ask them about Dave and Busters.
L:  About Dave and -- okay, yeah.  I'll tell them to take me there.

R:  Yeah.  This is not about video games is it?  Let's see -- 
L:  No.  No.  [LAUGH] 
R:  What else.
L:  I don't really know what -- what they -- you know, when you're talking on this thing do they care if you don't stay on topic or what?  I don't really know.
R:  I don't know either.
L:  Yeah.  I don't know, um -- 
R:  I guess they put -- oh, me and my friend, she has, um -- we both have Scrabble -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and we play head to head.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  You do?  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  And -- 
L:  Who with?
R:  -- ah, yes.  And we talk on the phone.  It is, um -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and -- see she lives, um, in Austin which is about thirty minutes away.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And we play head to head Scrabble.
L:  That's funny.
R:  She's thirty four.  I guess that's what you do when you get old.
L:  Yeah, I guess.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Yes.  [LAUGH] It, ah -- it is -- we -- we schedule those games.
L:  Does she -- does -- does -- who wins?  Do you win or -- 
R:  Me.
L:  -- does she win?
R:  I have a -- 
L:  You do?  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- I have a better vocabulary.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I have a masters degree.  I always throw that up in her face.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  It's like if -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you would have finished graduate school -- yeah, but, um -- 
L:  What's your, um, what's your masters in?
R:  In psychology.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm getting mine in sociology.  So -- 
R:  Serious?  Are you --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- in a masters? 
L:  Mhm.  Yes -- 
R:  In sociology?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm.  How -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- how far do you have to go?
L:  Ah, it's a two year program.  So, yeah -- 
R:  You going to get a doctorate?
L:  -- I just finished my first year.  I don't know.  Maybe.  Did -- you didn't want to go on and get a doctorate? 
R:  Um, I'm starting next year.  I'm -- I'm trying to see if -- if I'm going to be here or in north Carolina.  But, I'm going to get it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in, um, human services administration.
L:  Oh, cool -- 
R:  But, the main thing with getting a masters in sociology at this point, a lot of the, um, different places want you to have a licence [inaudible].
L:  Yeah.  Oh, yes --  
R:  Because my undergrad -- 
L:  -- uh-huh.
R:  -- is in sociology.
L:  Really?
R:  I didn't want to do social work, so I did -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, counselling psychology so you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- definitely look at it as far as, you know, getting a -- a d- -- a -- a doctorate. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, one step at a time.  You're twenty five.
L:  Yeah.  Uh-huh -- 
R:  You have [LAUGH] --  
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  But -- 
L:  Yeah.  I got to do one step at a time.  But still I got to think ahead too.  So -- 
R:  Yeah, that's the thing.  Because when I just had a bachelors degree, every -- everybody's wanted you to have a masters and then you get --
L:  Right.
R:  -- paid more money if --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you're licensed because, um, you know, everybody has to do a Medicaid or a private insurance.
L:  Right.
R:  Even if you want to do any type of private practice.  But, with --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- your masters degree you can still look at administrative level jobs -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, more so than, um, direct service, you know -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- working with people.  [MN] So -- 
L:  Yeah.  That's -- yeah, that's true.  So, yours was in psychology?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Okay.  And -- 
R:  Yep.
L:  -- you said you work with the mentally ill?
R:  Mhm.  Mentally ill adults.  I, um, work in a day program.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  With -- and then on the weekends I go to the hospital and I do psychiatric assessments -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- in the emergency room.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  So, yeah.
L:  Huh.  But -- 
R:  And you had to have a licence to do it so that's what I was --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- saying, it's -- it's good to have a li- -- a licence if you're going to work direct service.  But, if not, you can -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- look at the administrative end of it. 
L:  Okay.  Yeah, my mom -- her, um -- she almost had a masters in -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- psychology and, um, she gave psychological tests -- 
R:  Uh-huh.  Oh, okay.
L:  -- to people.  So, yeah.  So, she gave like a lot of mentally ill people their -- you know, their tests and stuff so they could get services and everything -- 
R:  Mhm.  Oh, okay, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  But -- 
R:  Um, what -- 
L:  -- she liked it.  But, now she's a social worker.  So -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, she -- 
R:  Oh, that's cool.  
L:  -- quit after a while with it.
R:  You --
L:  Yeah, but she was -- 
R:  -- have to have a big heart.  It --
L:  Yeah, you do.
R:  -- doesn't pay a lot.
L:  You do.  Yeah.  Does it ever get, like, depressing -- 
R:  Mm mm.
L:  -- sometimes?  No.
R:  [NOISE] No, 'cause w- well, as I talk I'm potting plants.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  This is my new hobby.  Oh, fun.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, no, I'm repotting plants and I play video games and I play tennis.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I have a nine year old.
L:  Okay.  So, she -- 
R:  So, but, no, see -- 
L:  -- keeps you busy.
R:  -- you know, you have to do burn out control.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I travel a lot.
L:  Yeah.  I don't really do -- the whole plant thing, I kind of kill them.  So -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't really -- I don't really know how to take care of them, you know?
R:  You know, this is a -- this is my new hobby.  I just bought -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- 'em.
L:  You did?
R:  So, I said I'm going to -- mhm, I bought four.  I'm planting, then I'm going to name them.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH] So, and see how long I can keep them alive before my mother has to come and get 'em again.
L:  Yeah.  I know, I'm just really bad with plants.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I just don't know what to do.  Did you, like, read about it like on the internet or anything before you bought them or you -- 
R:  Mm mm.  
L:  -- just bought 'em.
R:  The man that I bought 'em from he told me how to water 'em and he -- he's just -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I just have to water 'em and give them sunlight he says.
L:  Okay.
R:  So [MN] -- 
L:  Yeah.  Um -- 
R:  -- I'll see how that works out.
L:  I know.  I always kill plants so --
