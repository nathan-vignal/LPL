R:  +Hello -- hello.
L:  Hi.  [LAUGH] --  
R:  Hi, I'm Rena.  What's your name?
L:  Hi, I'm Dean.
R:  Hi Dean.  What state are you in?
L:  I'm in, ah, North Carolina.
R:  North Carolina, okay, and I'm in New York.  [MN] 
L:  Oh.  Wow -- 
R:  Ye- yeah, it's interesting.  Ah, so we're supposed to talk about, ah, computer games.
L:  Right.
R:  Ah, I don't really play that much on, ah, the computer.  Do you?
L:  Well, yeah, at -- 
R:  Are -- 
L:  -- work I do.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Ah, at work, uh-huh.  Wh -- what kind of games do you play?
L:  Um, I don't mind.  I play, um [MN] mainly puzzle games or, like, games that deal with the colors.  Kind of Tetris or something like that.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  So, um, there's one's called [several inaudible words] and there's one called Suite Two.  They're all the same thing but they -- the pictures just look different.
R:  Oh -- 
L:  The process is the same.
R:  Uh-huh.  And you said that was like Tetris?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  'Cause that game I know a little bit.
L:  Yeah, you -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- just kind of line up the colors and get rid -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- of 'em -- 
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
L:  -- like that.  So -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um -- 
R:  Mhm.  I think one time a long time ago I played like, ah, Solitaire.  They have card games that you could play.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think I did that, um, but since I don't really play a lot of games on the computer, I don't know just -- it wasn't that exciting for me.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, you -- you enjoy what you do, right?
L:  Well, yeah, but see like, um, for instance last week -- I work for a radio station.
R:  Oh.
L:  And so last week it was kind of like really, really boring because they were doing a promotion where people stay in a tent overnight.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And so I was working from, like, three to -- three to six in the morning.
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  And just sitting in there making sure that these people didn't escape from the tent.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, there was nothing else to do and there was a computer so I was like, "Oh, okay" well, I played some games. 
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Yeah -- 
L:  And -- 
R:  Might -- 
L:  But, um, 
R:  -- as well take advantage.
L:  But, yeah.  [LAUGH] Get paid to play.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  That's right.  That's the best.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, ah, you never play at home?
L:  Um, occasionally.  I really -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- don't get -- 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- home very much.  So -- 
R:  Oh, I see.  I see.
L:  I basically live at work.
R:  Oh.  I understand.  I understand -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  W- -- I know we're not supposed to discuss off the topic but I'm just curious.  What do you do at the radio station?
L:  I, um, [MN] do promotions.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And in a hospital do on air -- 
R:  Oh -- 
L:  -- a little bit.  So -- 
R:  Well, that's fun.  What's the name of the radio station?
L:  Um, Ninety Four Five the Beat.
R:  Ninety Four Five the Beat.  Okay.  If I'm ever in north Carolina -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I'll -- 
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- I'll -- I'll listen for it.  Ninety Four Five the Beat.  Oh, okay.  But -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [MN] anyway, ah, getting back to the topic, um, [MN] I don't really have that much to say on it because I don't -- you know, I don't really play but, ah,  I imagine that, ah, you know, i- i- if a person is bored -- I'm not talking about at work but I'm just saying, I guess it's a way i- if a person is bored or lonely or has nothing to do or even if the weather is bad and you -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- have to be on a computer, I guess it could fill your time up.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right.
L:  And I do have, like, a couple of games on CD rom that -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- my little brother bought for me that are just like puzzle games kind -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- of like, um, like -- 
R:  Oh, so that's good.
L:  -- um, Scrabble or something like that.
R:  Oh.  Oh, you don't need another person to play that?
L:  No.  You go and get the computer.
R:  Oh.  I didn't -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- know that.  Now, that's -- 
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- interesting.  Ah, see -- 
L:  So -- 
R:  -- I just learned something.
L:  Yeah, there's -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- a lot of good games on there but I just r- really don't have time.  I used to be a big video game where they just like -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- stay on the computer all the time.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, a lot of people did not have lives do that because I know people -- you can go on line to like -- like, you know, AOL and go to their game sites.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And go into the game room and there's like a little chat area on the site.  People just go in there -- they go into the game room, they don't play the games -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it's sad.  So -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or meet friends and stuff like that.  But -- 
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  -- I started thinking, you know, "I need to really get off of this".  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I -- I guess it can be very, um, [MN] like it really pulls you.  Like, you want to just do that, right?  It's very exciting -- 
L:  Yeah.  But -- yeah.  Kind -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of like addictive or something.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well -- 
L:  Addictive.
R:  Well, years ago I didn't play on the internet but years ago they had like Mario Brothers -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- type of thing and I could see how that's, ah, in the same way probably very addicting 'cause it's like you reach this certain level and you wanted to go further and higher and then it's just like it consumes you.  It's like you want -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to do it.  So, I assume these computer games are similar.
L:  Yeah.  They're -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just like that.
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  And -- 
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- how did you find out about it?
L:  I did their, um, on line search. 
R:  Mm.
L:  I was bored one day.  It was, ah, "Okay, there's nothing else for me to do.  Let me sit here and figure something to do".  So, I just typed in games.
R:  Oh.
L:  And -- 
R:  Ah, anybody else d- -- 
L:  -- just started downloading.
R:  Anybody else do that at work?
L:  Oh, yeah, everybody.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Oh, so it's [LAUGH] -- oh, that's different, you know?  That's cool.  It's like a party.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] That's not bad, huh.
L:  And then of course, um, there's like little games that come on your computer whenever you get your personal computer.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it has like the Solitaire and, um, [MN] what is it?  That Hearts game and -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, [MN] oh, goodness.  What is that other one?  Like, Ping Pong or something like that -- 
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
L:  And you can just sit there and play those if you don't have internet.
R:  Oh -- 
L:  So -- 
R:  -- well, that's cool.  But, I -- I still like that, ah, other thing you said about the Scrabble.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That -- that I really like 'cause I -- 'cause you can really learn stuff.  It keeps your mind -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, like, if you do crossword puzzles it keeps your mind, um, busy or active or whatever.  I could -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- guess also with Scrabble, if you have no one to play with, you could do it on the computer.  It keeps your mind going.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, that's -- that's got to be good.
L:  And it's easier to cheat with a computer 'cause you can do -- grab the dictionary and look it up right there.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Oh.  I see.  I didn't -- 
L:  The computer never knows.
R:  -- know that.  Boy, at least things are learning, I'm telling you.  Oh, my goodness.  Wow.  Um, have you done this before?  This whole thing?
L:  Yeah, I did it one time.
R:  Oh, okay.  And they call you -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- whenever you -- you put down -- whatever you put down, they call you, right?
L:  Yeah.  Because I only put down Sunday between six and seven -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- that way I know, you know -- 
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- this is a good time for me.  Don't call me any other time.
R:  Oh, I see.  I see.
L:  So, I -- but I haven't gotten like a cheque or anything like that.  I remember when I signed up for it it's a -- I was like, I needed the extra money. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I don't mind giving my input if they -- 
R:  Yeah, and -- yeah.
L:  -- accept to pay me.
R:  I think this is kind of fun and easy and you know, not -- nothing -- n- not a big deal.  But, I think you g- -- I think you get the money when the -- everything is done -- when you've done all the phone calls. 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I think that's how it works.  Because -- 
L:  Because I did that one.
R:  Yeah, but that one is only supposedly ten dollars for each one.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right.  So, then -- I -- I think they send it to you at one time.
L:  No.  Well, how many times are we going to get the calls?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Ah, you're allowed three times I think.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, you said you've done two already, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is this the second one?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  So, you just have one more.  But, you can also call in.  Ah -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- yeah, there's a number that you can call in and that way, like, if you want to call back, ah, you know the number and another -- I don't know if you could do it today because it's -- it's probably going to be the same topic.  But, maybe -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- if you can call tomorrow, you'll get a -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- different topic and then they'll send you the money.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yes.  So -- 
L:  That's what I need to do.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Just call them.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, and get it.  Ah, one time -- I think the first time that I -- I did it, I had forgotten and I'd put down the hours and actually I had -- I put down like from seven to ten because I didn't know how long, um, to put it down.  And actually, unless my w- -- um, unless my clock is wrong they really called at six fifty five.  It's like I barely got in the door and --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- then it was ringing already.  So, I -- so, I -- I made it but, ah, another time I missed it by, like, one second.  So, ah -- 
L:  Wow.
R:  -- yeah, but it's okay.  It's -- it's cool.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's just that I find that it's very hard to -- to talk about the same topic for ten minutes.  It's very hard --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's very hard -- 
L:  Yeah.  Last time, I think, we talk- -- we were supposed to talk about, um, if we could move -- if somebody gave us a million dollars -- 
R:  Right, I had the same thing.  Right.
L:  -- would we move or something.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And that lasted seven minutes.  It might -- probably not even that long, maybe like two minutes. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, some are like back and forward, like, "Okay, yeah I move.  Okay, no".  And then it's like, "Okay, what about your family?"
R:  Right.
L:  Okay.
R:  Right.  Yeah, it's hard.  It's very hard because you find that -- you -- you start on the topic and then you just move around.  It gets off the topic and you just get into something else.  It's -- 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- very hard.  It's very hard to stay focused.  It is.
L:  I wonder if they rate us [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  Yeah -- 
L:  -- it'd be like, um -- 
R:  -- I don't know -- I don't really know what they're doing.  Supposedly it's supposed to be like for speech.  But, I think it's probably something like psychological, ah, like they're trying to f- figure out -- I mean, a lot of times when they do studies they tell you one thing when they're really studying something else.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because they want you to be unbiased and if you know what it is you're not going to be unbiased.  So, they're saying it's something about speech patterns.  I don't think it has anything to do with speech patterns.  I think it has to do with, um, well my own personal opinion I think it has to do with, like, can you stay on the topic for ten minutes?  [LAUGH] --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or how you -- ah, what do you do if you can't?  Do you stay on it or do you go off --
