L:  Hi.  This is Atlanta. 
R:  Atlanta.
L:  Hi.
R:  This is Lisa.
L:  Hello Lisa.
R:  Hi.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  How are you?
R:  Good.  Where are you calling -- where are you from?
L:  Dagwah[?], Massachussetts, and -- 
R:  Where?
L:  -- yourself?
R:  [inaudible] Seattle, Washington.
L:  Wow.  Cool -- 
R:  We're all the way across -- 
L:  -- all the way across the country, huh -- 
R:  I -- I know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  All right.  We're supposed to talk about computer games.
R:  I know.  I don't play a lot of computer games though.
L:  I don't -- I don't either but, um -- 
R:  Oh, this should be a go- -- a good conversation then.  Maybe we [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, mm.
L:  I do prefer -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- the educational computer games.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I like the kids games like Oregon Trail.
R:  You know, I know that one too.  Isn't -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- that weird?  I know that one.  I -- 
L:  I like things -- 
R:  -- like that one.
L:  -- like that.  That's -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- my -- my kind of computer game.  Um, I like history.  I -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like games where I can use knowledge that I have what I know -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- to beat the game, you know?
R:  Yeah.  Same here.  I actually -- I really like the Oregon Trail too and I like -- I guess I kind of like -- if I was just going to play something for fun, I like trivia games -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, where you have to think about, you know, like history or language or -- or things like that.  But, um, I -- I know, I like the ones that you actually learn something from too -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- most of the time, otherwise you get kind of bored I guess.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um.
L:  I -- I don't go for the on line gambling games or any of that kind of thing -- 
R:  No.  Or -- 
L:  -- you know?
R:  -- even the on line where you're playing somebody else who's in another city but you're on line playing a game.  I don't even know how to do that.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I -- I've never tried it either, no, I -- 
R:  No.
L:  -- I don't know how to do that either.
R:  It doesn't really appeal to me actually.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  No.  I -- well I'm -- I already am on line too much as it is just checking my email -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- and doing my lesson plans.  I'm a teacher so I go on line and I look for stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I definitely you know -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- I'm on line, like, two or three hours a day sometimes as it is.  I don't have time to go on line and play games on -- 
R:  I feel the -- 
L:  -- the computer too.
R:  -- same way.  I'm a -- 
L:  You know?
R:  -- I'm a grad student and -- and, ah, even when I was still just working full time I was on the computer all day and it's not my way to relax at all -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- I'd rather get away from the computer [LAUGH] actually.
L:  Right.
R:  But, um, yeah.  So, hm, so -- 
L:  Ah -- 
R:  -- you're a teacher.
L:  Yeah, I -- I, um, [MN] I like playing computer games with my little daughter.  She's six years old.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I get -- you know, a lot of the games are not the kind where two people can play each other but -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I sit there with her and watch her play the games.  They're -- they're all disks -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know?  Not on line stuff.  I like to watch her play the games and she learns and -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- asks me questions at the -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- same time and -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- asks for help and you know, I -- I could tell when she -- she starts yelling at the computer that means she's getting frustrated.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] Well, we have a little girl that we take care of too sometimes.  She's seven and sometimes we -- yeah, we have a few CD roms for her and they're all educational ones too and she likes -- if we're not right next to her doing it then what she'll do is she'll just part -- play part of it but then, "Come -- come here, come here.  Let me show you what I learned.  Let me show you what I did" and -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and that's really great.  I really like that, um -- 
L:  You like that positive feedback.  They -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they're not satisfied just to work with the computer -- 
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- they want human interaction too.
R:  It's great.
L:  Which is good.
R:  I know, and I'm glad to see that and I -- I learned something from that too actually.  Like, okay, you just can't sit them in front of this box and you -- that's not the point.  They -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- want to share it with you and, um, I also like, um -- [MN] one time we went on line -- actually, we did go on line too at Zoom.  You know, that PBS show? 
L:  Yeah.  I've seen the show -- 
R:  And they do have -- 
L:  I haven't checked out the website.
R:  They do have it on website and some of it was pretty fun.  We actually sat there one night and played -- it -- it was like -- they had like a little my- mystery game where you had to try and figure out stuff by using scientific facts that they teach you along the way and it was pretty cool.  It was -- that was pretty good.  That was the only on line one I've ever really done that I can think of, um, but that's a really good one.  A very [several inaudible words] -- 
L:  Yeah, that -- I'll have to check that out.
R:  Yeah.  There's little science experiments but you don't actually have to do them, of course, they just have -- for example, like, they'll have two different kinds of liquid and if you put them together what happens and you just click and see what happens when it -- you know, and it's like, "Oh, that's what happens when you put those two things together".  [LAUGH] 
L:  Cool.
R:  It's all virtual but, you know?  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  My daughter likes barbie dot com.
R:  I've never -- 
L:  And polly -- 
R:  -- seen that one.
L:  pocket dot com.
R:  Oh, they still have Polly Pocket?
L:  Yeah, polly pocket dot com. 
R:  Oh.
L:  She loves that one.  That's her favorite I think.
R:  Do they have games or is it -- is it just -- 
L:  They have games and they have things where you can dress up polly pocket -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and she plays with a band.  You can play the music -- 
R:  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  -- you know?  She loves that.
R:  I remember Polly Pocket but I didn't even know that they still made that toy and I didn't know that there was an on line game too -- 
L:  They -- they have a wonderful, ah, website.  Polly pocket dot com.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  Check it out with your -- the little girl that you -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- watch.
R:  She probably would.
L:  They -- she loves playing this -- the games on there and you know, printing out Polly pages and stuff -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And barbie -- 
R:  Do -- 
L:  -- dot com too.
R:  Do a lot of your students play video games do you think, or how -- how old are your students?
L:  My students are cognitively impaired high school -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- students.
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, yeah, so I think a lot of them do play -- play video games and maybe spend too much time on the computer at home sometimes -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, or in front of the TV.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But -- 
R:  Yeah.  So not [MN] -- I'm trying to think.  Oh, yeah, I think a lot of college students are doing it too and I -- I -- I'm sort of -- I went back to school after a long time of being away and so -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like, everyone seems a lot younger than me.  [LAUGH] So, when -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I go to the computer labs they even have signs posted up for gamers, you know, for people playing games.  Like, academic work th- that takes priority that you have to tell them [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Or else they're just going to sit there and play games all night.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  If they're playing, you got to kick 'em off the computer, huh? 
R:  I can't even imagine.  I mean, I'm just in there, like, I've just got to get this done.  I got to get this work done.  I got to go home and -- and there are people that are just sitting there, I guess, playing games.
L:  Playing games, yeah, I see that -- 
R:  So, I don't know.
L:  -- I see that when I go to the public library sometimes -- 
R:  Oh, yeah, I bet.  I bet.
L:  You know, ah -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  They're sit -- I -- I -- I go into the children's, ah, room in -- in the [inaudible] Public Library and I -- I -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- saw kids sitting there at the computer and I say, "Oh, they're studying".
R:  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  No, they're not.  They're -- 
R:  [several inaudible words] 
L:  -- playing games.  I looked over their shoulders -- 
R:  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  -- they're playing games.
R:  So, human -- 
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- nature doesn't -- 
L:  Their parents probably -- 
R:  -- change [several inaudible words].
L:  -- think that they're studying -- 
R:  But, they -- 
L:  -- you know?
R:  -- really are at the library, just like they said they were going to be.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They go to the library and they play computer games.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know?
R:  Well, it seems like that, um, that human nature doesn't change even though the technology changes so it's -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the same, you know, stuff -- 
L:  Kids would -- 
R:  -- going on.
L:  -- rather play games than study, you know?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess so.  But, ah, [SIGH] oh, well, that's all I have.  I don't know what else I can say about video games -- going on computer games.  I can say -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a lot about computers, I guess.  [LAUGH] I don't know.
L:  Well -- 
R:  Have you done this before?  This -- this, ah -- 
L:  Yeah, this is my second call.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  This is my third one.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, we get three, right?
R:  I guess so.  I -- 
L:  I think so.
R:  -- can't remember.  I guess you can -- 
L:  I think they said three and there was a possibility that some people would be chosen to do more.
R:  Right.  Where if -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- there was a special, like a -- I think there might have been even ten or something, but I can't remember.
L:  Yeah.  Well, we're supposed to talk for -- talk about computers for at least -- computer games for at least eight minutes I guess.  [LAUGH] 
R:  How long has it been?  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't know.  She'll come on and -- 
R:  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  -- tell us.  No, you know, I, um, I've been using the computer probably since the nineteen eighties.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, when -- that's when I first got one in my classroom.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And back then, um, we didn't have the internet of course.
R:  Right.
L:  But, I got, you know, Oregon Trail and -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- all that -- all those neat games, um, on CD rom and the kids really, really got into it especially back then 'cause it was new to them, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  They didn't have -- most of them didn't have computers at home.
R:  I really like the, um, when I first -- when those all came out -- first started coming out I really -- most of them were text based games, you know?  Just the text, there was -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- not graphics and -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I loved those games and I still love those games.  Even when I was a kid I liked playing those, ah, text based games.  And I think Oregon Trail is sort of similar to that --  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They have a little bit of graphics but mostly it's text and -- and they had, um, Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.
L:  Oh, I read that book.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I never played the -- the -- the CD rom though.  I didn't know there was one.
R:  Well, there used to be, um, like when they actually had those big floppy disks, like they're literally floppy.  Do you remember those -- I don't know if -- if -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  They don't even work in any computer that I know anymore but I used to have one of those that had that game on it and I think you can download it from the internet now.  I don't know, I can't remember but maybe it's on CD rom too.  I can't remember how [several inaudible words] -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  But, that was hilarious.  That was a wonderful game.  That was a fun game to play.
L:  Did you have to have your towel with you?
R:  Yeah, you had -- 
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- to have your towel all the time.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  And it was loosely based on the novel -- on the book and -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so you could get through part of it just knowing the book and then the rest of it you just had to figure out, like, you know, what to do to get out of this Vogon ship and all that stuff.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  And it was really funny and it -- 
L:  That sounds fun -- like fun.
R:  You should -- yeah, you could probably check it out.  It probably is still -- there is a, you know, a website somewhere that you could just type in, you know?
L:  Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.  Okay, I'll -- 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- have to try that.
R:  You know +an interactive game or something like that and -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's pretty funny.  It's pretty funny.  Uh-huh -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And if -- 
L:  Yeah, that -- 
R:  -- you get stuck there's -- 
L:  -- that was -- that was a hilarious novel.  I read [inaudible] --
