L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.  Hi, this -- 
L:  Hello.
R:  -- is Pat and I'm -- 
L:  Hello.
R:  -- and I'm -- I'm in, ah, Peabody, Massachussetts, a- a- and who are you?
L:  Oh, my name's Christina and I'm in Philadelphia.
R:  Oh, goodness.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um -- 
L:  Kind of a distance away.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, yeah, not that far though really.  Um -- 
L:  Well -- 
R:  -- do you play computer games?
L:  Um, I actually -- I don't have any that, like, I buy.  Usually if I play computer games I play them on, like, Yahoo or just like simple ones, like --  
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, me too.
L:  Like -- like Lingo or like [LAUGH] games -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- like that.
R:  Ye- -- 
L:  Ones that I don't have to spend money for is usually -- 
R:  Exactly.  Although my grand kids -- I live with my -- two of my grand children and, um, they're at that age where if -- if it's out there they have it and then there's some way or another that they can copy the games, you know the, um, [MN] s- -- ah, one person has a c- -- a game and then they rerecord it or burn it or whatever you call it, you know -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  You can tell I'm not -- you know, not the most sophisticated person on the computer -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, um, they have some incredibly, incredibly intricate ones.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And some of them I think are quite violent.
L:  I agree, you know?  I, um, I -- my boyfriend actually has the Play Station Two and it has all -- all those, like, um, Grand Theft Auto -- 
R:  Right.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  -- which is -- that is -- I watched that game once for about ten minutes and it was like the most -- 
R:  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  -- vulgar thing I've ever -- 
R:  They're h- h- --  
L:  -- seen in my life.
R:  -- horrible.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  They're also like violent.  I -- yeah, I don't know.
R:  Yeah.  When it -- 
L:  I couldn't imagine growing up, like, playing those kind of games.  I'd go out and like [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  -- run a car over it or something.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I think it has an influence on the kids though, I really do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, it's one thing to say it's a cartoon but -- or -- but -- but it -- or digitally enhanced -- whatever you want to call it.  But, I think they're incredibly violent and, um --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Every now and then the kids download something on my computer.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, I'm kind of amazed, you know?  Um, I -- I like -- you know, I go on and play Jeopardy and stuff like that, or we'll play, um, [MN] some of those card games and things -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, ah, that's just a -- to amuse myself really -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know?  But, um, Jeopardy I --  
L:  I -- 
R:  -- like, but -- 
L:  What's -- the one -- ah, games dot com has a lot of good ones.  Like, they --  
R:  Oh -- 
L:  -- have, um -- [MN] just like different, like, puzzle games, like, you win prizes and stuff, like if -- 
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- you, like, collect tokens and -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- stuff like that.
R:  Oh, I know -- 
L:  I don't know how to play games like that.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, you know, one of the boards that I'm on, um, [NOISE] has been mentioning -- is it -- is it Jeopardy or Wheel of Fortune? 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And apparently Wheel of Fortune, if you watch it on TV and then play it on line, you know you're eligible for quite a few prizes and you know, that sort of -- 
L:  That's -- 
R:  -- thing.
L:  -- pretty cool.
R:  Yeah.  And people have been, you know, really thrilled with it.  But -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, and then, um, [MN] ah, you have to make sure that you get the word the final Jeap- -- the -- the final, ah, what is it?  The final contest there and -- at -- at --  
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
R:  You know, you have to get that and [MN] you know, fill that in on line and, um -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- they're giving away automobiles etcetera, etcetera.
L:  That's [several inaudible words]
R:  But, um, I think they're great because I'm basically an eleven to seven -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- night worker, you know?
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, come ten o'clock at night I'm starting -- I get wound up.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] So -- 
L:  Yeah, and you know -- 
R:  -- so, when everybody- -- 
L:  -- what else, there's --
R:  Well, when everybody else -- 
L:  -- nothing on TV.  [LAUGH]  
R:  -- everybody else in the [LAUGH] house is ready for bed, you know, but I -- I -- you know, I've been in health care for so many years -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that, um, ah, you know, like I say eleven, eleven thirty, and I think I'll probably always wake up at, like, four o'clock in the morning if I do go to sleep.  Four o'clock in the morning to do rounds, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And [LAUGH] but then I'll go to the computer and play some of the card games or go to Jeopardy and -- 
L:  Yeah.  It -- it makes so much more sense to, like, do that than, like, go to a computer store and buy a game for like forty to sixty bucks and then -- 
R:  [LAUGH] I know, that's going to be outdated.
L:  Yeah.  And I'm going to be so bored with it in a little bit anyway so -- 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- there's so many websites where you can go to.  It just -- 
R:  Oh, there are.
L:  -- makes more sense. 
R:  There are tonnes of them.  Even -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- playing, um, [MN] oh, I don't know.  Any card game you want to play, um, I -- I notice there are a lot of sites that if you -- if you put down a certain amount of money, they'll let you gamble on -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah, you know, I said, "Okay, I'll avoid those".  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Yeah, that seems like trouble to me.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Give 'em my credit card and then I wouldn't -- I wouldn't think that it's like money you're spending and then -- 
R:  I know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- next thing I know I've got, like, a four thousand dollars debt.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  I know.  Isn't that awful?  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  No, there -- you're right though, there's a -- such a wide variety of games that you can -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- play that you really -- I don't know -- I don't know what the thing is about buying those games that -- I appreciate the artwork in them.
L:  Yeah, that's very true.  I'm actually an art student so I can -- 
R:  Ye- -- ah, yeah, exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, yeah, and -- and I -- I appreciate that.  And -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- God bless 'em, ah, whatever the guy was on to have dreamed up some of these.  You know -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there were days when I wish [LAUGH] I had some, you know -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- but, ah, I mean, sometimes you're [several inaudible words] somebody's imagination is just, you know, way over the edge.  [LAUGH] You know -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, um, ah, but -- but, like I say I'm -- I'm a little leary of the violence, you know -- 
L:  I agree with you too, yeah.  It's -- it's kind of scary, like, I kind of, like, just missed, like, the whole computer game, like, generation thing 'cause, like, when I was younger, like, we had, like, Super Nintendo and stuff.  We -- 
R:  Exactly.  Yeah. 
L:  -- didn't have, like -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  We didn't have, like, the crazy, like, games that they have now and I just can't imagine it, like, it's completely different.  And I'm, like, fairly, like, in that age range too but it's -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just so different from when I was growing up.  If -- if I would have had those games when I was growing up I would've -- I don't know.  My mom -- first of all, my mom wouldn't let me watch, like, the Simpsons when I was growing up or, like -- 
R:  Ah, yeah, I know.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] Like, 'cause they called, ah, the father by the first name, I wasn't allowed to watch it.  So -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- I can't even imagine being like, "Hey, Mom, look.  Here's this, like, gun shoot out game".  She'd -- 
R:  Oh, gun shoot, yeah.  And then there was one though where they were, ah -- it looked like they were into S. and M. and, um -- 
L:  Oh, God.
R:  -- you know, rape and the women -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- had these very strange bodies [LAUGH] you -- 
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- know.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  It's like, it's teaching kids to be something like completely that they shouldn't be.
R:  Exactly.  Exact- -- but -- 
L:  They have one -- they have one game that I heard about on, like, y- you know, like a night talk show called, like, BMX Triple X -- 
R:  Oh, boy.
L:  -- where it's like -- where it's a bunch of like -- um, the whole point of it is to like play a -- like b- -- like bike racing. 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And then, like, if you win all the puzzles you get to go to a strip show.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Like [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Oh, wow -- 
L:  So -- 
R:  Ah, yeah, that's kind of out of it, you know -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, the -- 
L:  So, they'll come up with anything to sell it, I guess.
R:  Yeah -- 
L:  But -- 
R:  But, ah, no I do find the kids have some fabulous -- um, you know that they download and -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- boy, they play it.  But, I do notice also that they get bored with it after they've seen -- what is it?  Trekking Two and, um -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, those, you know?  So, the -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the ones that are on the computer have a tendency to get kind of left in the lurch there, you know?
L:  Yeah, or they come out with, like, these updates, like, so quickly too.  So -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- there's always, like, something, like, new.
R:  Mm.  Mhm.
L:  It's, ah, you know?  And you know, kids [several inaudible words], "I want this now, I want this".
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] So -- 
R:  Well, like I say one of -- one of the kids a- -- manages to a- -- get hold of things that he can burn copies off.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, that saves a little bit, you know?
L:  Yeah, that's right -- 
R:  But, ah, some of these games are, like, you know, forty, fifty, fifty five, sixty dollars.  I'm like, "Whoa".
L:  Yeah.  I -- 
R:  You know?
L:  I can't see spending that kind of money on that, you know?
R:  No.  No.
L:  It's something that -- like a -- a- -- I would spend sixty bucks on, like, something I know I'm going to use a lot.  But, something that's for me to sit in front of a computer for hours and hours, like -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- after, like, standing up and working all day to get that money, like, it -- 
R:  Well, you know, I also found -- ah, you say standing up at work.  Yeah, I was very accustomed to working long, long hours. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And running around like a crazy person 'cause I was on -- I worked on an alzheimers unit that was locked, you know?
L:  Oh, really -- 
R:  Advanced alzheimers.  And, um, it was great.  I loved it.  But, um, I did find that once I had to -- I had an injury -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which required me to stay off my feet and park my butt in a chair -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for like six months through -- 
L:  Wow.
R:  -- therapy and everything.  And I got hooked on to that computer and I -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- found oh, my God, the computer is just -- ah -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know, it was like I -- I -- I --I couldn't live if that computer wasn't -- 
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  -- you know -- 
L:  Yeah, they -- 
R:  -- on and doing something -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and I -- and I had to withdraw from it because it was just starting to take over and the -- 
L:  They do get addicting.  They -- 
R:  It does.
L:  -- really do.
R:  But, you know, you -- but, I mean, never mind the games, you know?  Um, Solitaire.  How many hours [LAUGH] can you play Solitaire -- 
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, yeah.
R:  -- on the computer but I found myself saying, "Oh, yeah, [inaudible] oh damn" you know [MN].  And a- -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- all this kind of stuff.  And, um, [MN] ah, you know, then, ah, like I say I got into Jeopardy and I -- I deluded myself by saying that I was educating myself.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Well, okay, that's not right.  But -- 
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  you know?  It's like -- 
L:  I -- yeah, it's -- 
R:  -- it just got horrible.  So -- 
L:  I remember when I -- when I first got the computer.  Like, I was, like, one of the last, like, one of my friends to have a computer so, like, when I first got it I would -- that's all I wanted to do is -- 
R:  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  -- like, I would go home -- go home from school and just, like, play on it, like, all the time.
R:  Yeah, it's amazing.
L:  [MN] Never get any work done.  I -- of course, like, that's how I got the computer saying that it would, like, be so good for my school work.
R:  [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] And -- and then event- -- 
R:  But --
