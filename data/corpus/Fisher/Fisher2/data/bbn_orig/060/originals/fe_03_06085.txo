R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  My name is Anna Gunn.  I'm in Los Angeles.
L:  My name is Rita.  I'm in, ah, Georgia, in Atlanta -- 
R:  So -- 
L:  -- Georgia.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Atlanta?
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  I got people --
L:  Well, actually, it's Marietta.
R:  -- down there.
L:  It's actually Marietta which is, ah, part of metro Atlanta.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [several inaudible words]  -- 
R:  So, do you play computer games Rita?
L:  Well, not exact- -- I do -- I have and I do play on the computer, ah, but I think they're probably thinking about games like, ah, Zelda and Zoom and you know, those sort of games.  Those I don't play, but I do play word games and things like that on line.  How about you?
R:  Yeah.  Um, my children got me addicted to a game on a kids website called Neo Pets.
L:  Oh, yeah -- 
R:  And [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.  I was on Neo Pets for a while.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  I like that place.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I was -- I was there for quite a while.  I haven't been, ah -- ah, but I -- then I kind of left it so I guess my poor pet's probably -- they don't seem to ever die, they just, you know, get close to it.  [LAUGH] --
R:  Well, I -- I have enjoyed -- ah, they have a word game on there called Solar Star.  But, I like that.  But, the one -- the thing that -- that -- is just been a shame because I -- I found that I could sit there for hours.  There's this game called Destructor Match.
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH] Okay.  I don't know if I've played those when I was on there or not.  I played a lot of, um, Solitaire and Pyramid and, ah, things like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, I don't know if I -- what's -- what's the -- what's the Destructor when it's like?
R:  It's -- it's, ah -- it's kind of like -- you know -- you've seen that game Tetris?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, it's the opposite of Tetris, where you have all these colored blocks and you're -- you're grouping them together so you can break 'em down and the object of the game is to clear them in as few moves as possible.
L:  Oh, yeah, I did the, um, um, yeah, I see, ah, a game called -- I'm trying to think what the name of it is.  Bubble.  Bubble something.  That's the same thing, um, I think.  You have to get them to line up and then you can -- try to get rid of them [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [several inaudible words] yeah.  Yeah -- 
R:  I love stuff -- 
L:  -- I've played -- 
R:  -- like that.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I've played that game, yeah.  That's very addictive.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, you -- you -- 
R:  I had to start limiting myself because I started messing around with that -- that website.  After I had surgery I wasn't supposed to be doing anything so I'd sit at the computer and work with one hand.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And [LAUGH] next thing I know the day is gone, and I -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- had been sitting there -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- like a -- you know?  Sad.
L:  Well -- 
R:  So, now it's an hour.
L:  -- [several inaudible words] Well, see, ah, ah -- that's a -- it gave you something to do, you know?  [LAUGH] 
R:  It sure -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- did.
L:  I just in [several inaudible words] from some, ah, some surgery myself.  I had to be out of work for two and a half weeks and, um, ah, you know, I -- I didn't really -- I thought that I would have a lot of time to play games [several inaudible words] actually most of the time it turned out not really [several inaudible words] doing.  But, I'm addicted to a game on a -- the I. one website called, ah, Word Queue and I play it almost every day.  [LAUGH]  
R:  On I. one, huh?  Mm -- 
L:  Yeah, I. one has got a lot of games.  A whole -- 
R:  It -- 
L:  -- lot of games.
R:  Now, I used to be on their site all the time and I haven't been there in a couple of years and, ah, now it sounds like I need to go back and, ah, see what's going on.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, they've got, um -- you know, they like for you to play for money on there but I don't usually 'cause -- I -- first place, I don't have much money.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Me neither.
L:  And I don't really, you know, feel like spending it that way.  But, you can play for free as much as you want to.
R:  Well -- 
L:  And, ah -- 
R:  -- playing for free would definitely be the way for -- to go.  I -- I think -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it would be quite silly to be, um, playing for money, you know?  I mean, but then to -- I guess the people that are doing that, maybe they got money to burn.
L:  Well -- 
R:  I don't.
L:  -- it's not a whole lot of money.  It's like you can put five dollars in and they have games that are just like twenty five cents or fifty cents and you can try to make [several inaudible words] you know?
R:  Mm.
L:  Ah, but, ah, still, I -- I like -- I -- I just prefer playing it for free 'cause I --  
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like the fun of it.  I don't want to be under pressure thinking, "Hey, I've got" you know, "I've got something to lose here".  [LAUGH]  
R:  Mhm.  Makes sense -- 
L:  So, I enjoyed it -- 
R:  -- to me.
L:  -- though, um, I went on Steel Jam for a while.  I like their trivia games.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  They have their trivia games on there and I go on there sometimes and play those.  But, ah, the Neo Pets I used to [several inaudible words] the little things are so cute.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, they are, and I've got two kids and they love it.  And, um, I used to see it on the computer screen all the time.  Like, I'd be doing some work, I'd get up to go do something else and one of the kids jump on the computer and Neo Pets was up.  So, finally I said, "Well, let me go see what they're looking at".
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  They are very cute.  Next thing I know, "Mommy, this is fun.  You up and get you an account so you can stop fooling around on ours".  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And that's been almost a year now.
L:  I, ah, almost a year?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, almost a year -- 
L:  I've got friends that have got, like, I've got one friend.  I think he's got about maybe -- oh, I don't know, fifteen or twenty Neo Pets and he's, you know, a -- a grown man in his -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- ah, I guess his late thirties with kids, you know?  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's pretty funny.
L:  And he said, "I think honestly they probably have about as many adults on that site as they do kids".
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, but it's a -- 
L:  But -- 
R:  -- it's a nice cycle.  You know, it's good for them to have something to do because there's so much crap on the internet.
L:  That's true.
R:  You know -- 
L:  And they learn a lot on there.  They -- you know, I think it's good for them.  They take care of their pets and they, ah -- 
R:  Yeah, they got to feed 'em.
L:  -- go and they find the food for 'em and everything.  I think that's, you know, healthy for them.
R:  Oh, yeah, you know, and then learning about auctions and -- oh, then they have a little stock market thing, you know?
L:  Yeah -- 
R:  So, there's been a lot of good stuff for them to learn and a lot of reading for them to do.
L:  Um -- 
R:  You know?  So, it's been -- 
L:  I -- 
R:  -- good.
L:  Yeah, I've got a, um, a website and a newsletter for kids that I do -- 
R:  Really.
L:  -- that's, ah, called Fabulous Freebies and Fun Links for Kids.  I've had it for, like, four years.
R:  Mm.
L:  And, ah, I have a lot of games and stuff like that on there for kids.  I mean, I don't -- ah, I have links to games.
R:  Oh, okay -- 
L:  It's just -- what it is, is, ah, I just -- when I find stuff on the web that I think kids will enjoy, and now I get a lot of them in my email and stuff like that too, because I've been doing it for so long.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.
L:  And, um, [MN] they, you know -- so, I have, ah, a lot of game sites and the thing that really is -- that a lot of times I go over there to check 'em out to make sure that they really are appropriate.  I always check 'em out to make sure they're appropriate for kids and I always also go over there, you know, to see if I like 'em or not, 'cause I'm not going to tell 'em I like, you know, to go to some site and then find out it's a boring site or I don't like it -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know?  So, um -- 
R:  Well, what's your website address?
L:  Um, well, the website itself is W.W.W. dot max star, ah, max and stars -- excuse me, we changed it.
R:  Max and star -- 
L:  Max and star dot net, I think, no I'm sorry.  Hang on, we've just changed our domain -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- name and I keep forgetting what it is.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Max and star dot net -- dot -- dot com.
R:  Okay.
L:  And it's slash fabulous dot H.T.M. will take you to the actual, um, kids [inaudible] site and, um, then, you know, there's a site there that are, um, a place on there -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- where you can, um, sign up for the website which is, on the [several inaudible words] newsletter which is hosted by Yahoo.  But, um -- 
R:  Oh, that sounds cool.
L:  Yeah -- 
R:  How'd you get into that?
L:  Um, I was working on line for a company called, um, [MN] um, Study Web.  I worked for Study Web for four years on line and I was, ah, researching educational sites -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for them, um, ah, you know, and I was looking up all these sites for children that had to do with -- oh, I think I did over -- over the course of the years that I was working for 'em, like I said for four years,  I think I did about thirty different subjects and, ah, so I kept finding all these games and things and briefings and stuff while I was looking that didn't have anything to do with my job but they looked like a lot of fun.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mm.
L:  So, I, um, wanted to share 'em.  Oh, yeah, I thought, "Wow, kids need to know about all this stuff.  Parents need to know about all this stuff.  It's out here for free for kids".  And I've got grand kids that are three years old and two years old and -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- ah, I -- you know, I wanted them for them and so I started collecting them and I've been doing it ever since.  It's been a lot of fun.
R:  That's nice -- 
L:  I've got a lot of people that have been on the newsletter ever since nineteen ninety nine.  They're still with me and I like the idea that there's kids are out there, you know, playing games and stuff that they would never have know about if they hadn't seen my website.
R:  Yeah.  That's nice.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What a nice contribution.
L:  Well, I enjoy it.  A couple of times I've tried to make it be kind of an extra income by adding, um, advertisements and stuff to the -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- website but it -- it doesn't [LAUGH] -- it doesn't -- 
R:  It doesn't work.
L:  -- actually -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  So, I mean, I've never actually -- but, you know, I've gotten an awful lot of pleasure out of it and I've never missed a week in four -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- years.
R:  Wow.
L:  So [MN] not even -- 
R:  That's great.
L:  -- when I was sick or whatever, I always -- I've always managed to get a -- where, um, a newsletter out 'cause I'm proud of that.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Wow.
