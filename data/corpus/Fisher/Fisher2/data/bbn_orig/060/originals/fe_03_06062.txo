L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name is, uh, Michelle.
L:  Hi, Michelle.  My name is Jabeen[?].  How are you?
R:  I'm doing good.  How are you?
L:  I'm doing good, thank you.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, so movies.  That's an easy one.
R:  Yeah, like this topic is just -- today, um, we went and saw the Matrix Reloaded.
L:  Oh, we -- I went and saw a movie today too.  Daddy Daycare [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, no [LAUGH]
L:  I took my daughter to see it.  It was funny.  It was so hysterical.
R:  Oh, that's with, uh, Eddie Murphy, right?
L:  Yeah.  Lately I don't -- [NOISE] lately [NOISE] I haven't been watching --uh, I haven't like liked Eddie Murphy too -- too much [NOISE] but in this movie [NOISE] he was really, really good [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It was so funny.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH] So, I mean what was that about?  I mean, I guess that he was a --
L:  Um, he was --
R:  -- dad, right?
L:  Yeah, it was -- it was just so funny.  Oh, it was just [inaudible]. That's one to see.  What was the Matrix like?
R:  You know, it was -- it was really good.  You can -- I mean, there's a lot of --
L:  Was it similar to the first --
R:  -- um, hype.
L:  -- one though?
R:  It was -- yeah, it was more than the first one.  It was, um, it was a lot of hype but it was very good.  It was, you know, a lot of special effects and a lot of action.  It was -- it was R rated though [LAUGH].  You wouldn't want to take --
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  Oh, I -- I didn't realize it was going to be R rated.  Why was it?  Was there any bad scenes inside?
R:  The only thing I -- I could think of is that there was so much violence because there -- there was a little bit of, um, you know, like adult situations going on and not a lot of language.
L:  Oh.
R:  I really didn't see why it was, you know, R.
L:  Oh, that's weird.
R:  It would have better I think if -- if, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- young kids could have seen it.
L:  Right, right.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  Oh, you had kids that you took with you.
R:  No, there were -- you know, but -- but there were a lot of kids who were wanting to see it --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and they weren't able to get in --
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  -- you know.
L:  I see.  Yeah, there was a lot of hype be- behind that movie.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I know, I know.  Do you like watching movies at the theater better?  Do you like staying at home and renting?
R:  Mhm, I think -- I think I like the movies better just because, uh, you know, you -- there's -- you know, you can see something that has just come out so it's brand new --
L:  Don't you think going to --
R:  -- and you can --
L:  -- the movies is so expensive?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I mean --
R:  There is that.
L:  I mean, oh my God, like today I went to see -- I went like and that -- that was a matinee show but in between like -- and you know, when you take kids like you know, they need soda and they need this and they want that --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- while they're watching the movie.  So, I mean, that's forty bucks including everything, you know, by the time you're done and then I -- I'm like "Wow, you know [LAUGH].  Maybe we should just have a movie night at home and rent a movie and then make our own popcorn [LAUGH]" you know.
R:  You do [LAUGH].  That's --
L:  I mean once in a --
R:  -- a good point.
L:  Yeah, but once in a while it's fun.  You're right, it's -- it's a lot of fun.  But, like, I know, like, do you do that like every week or is it just, like, a once in a while thing?
R:  [LAUGH] No, I wish I could do it every week.
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  Even for just two people it's pretty expensive.  It was -- I think it was like seven dollars to do this matinee show which isn't bad --
L:  Right, even for matinees.
R:  -- but it's just --
L:  Remember when, like, the evening shows used to be, like, seven dollars?
R:  Yeah, I know [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] And matinees used to be, like, three something I remember when I was a teenager, you know, which wasn't that long ago [LAUGH].
R:  No, I -- in fact I think they just went up to ten dollars around here which --
L:  Yeah, it's so crazy.
R:  --is crazy.
L:  Where are you?  Where do you live?
R:  In LA, Los Angeles.
L:  Oh, oh God.  I'm on the -- way on the other side of New York.  How funny is that? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Wow, this is truly like [several inaudible words].
L:  Yeah, and -- and, like, the city is -- like, here, I don't live in the city.  I live, like, in Long Island but it's super -- everything is super expensive here, you know, including the movies.  I mean, I think it's nine fifty now for a ticket, an evening ticket, you know.
R:  That sounds like LA [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, it's crazy you know.  So, it's like most of the time we just rent movies and stick around at home, you know, but what was your favorite movie that you've ever seen?
R:  Ever seen?  Uh.
L:  Well, lately I guess [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] Uh, I -- I -- I -- I probably have to say the Matrix Reloaded because I've seen some really bad ones lately [LAUGH].
L:  Really?
R:  Like the Core.  That was a terrible movie.
L:  Oh, gosh.  I -- I took my daughter -- I haven't seen -- I haven't really been to the movies lately, I've just been so busy but I took my daughter to see that Disney movie, the Pooh -- the Piglet's Big Adventure.  The Piglet movie or whatever.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And it was so -- for a Disney movie, for like Winnie the Pooh, it was hysterical.  Oh, my God we were dying, we were laughing so much throughout this movie.  It was so funny.  It was --
R:  Now, I mean -- even for you as an -- as an adult, it was funny [LAUGH]?
L:  Yeah, I -- yeah.  I mean, it was really funny.  Like Pooh acts so stupid sometimes.  There was this really --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It was really funny and my daughter's three and she just had a ball.  She really enjoyed it.  But I and my husband had a good time too [LAUGH].
R:  Now, that's -- that's so funny because you --
L:  Yeah, it was really -- it was really funny.
R:  Because I mean since the Lion King there really hasn't been anything I think that has been entertaining for adults, you know --
L:  I know.
R:  -- for Disney.
L:  But did you think the Lion King was funny?  I didn't think it was that funny.
R:  No.
L:  I just thought it was a good movie, you know.
R:  No, but you could get into, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- even as -- even being older you could get into it.
L:  Yeah, but I think I --
R:  -- whereas other movies you can't.
L:  -- I think if I were to see the same movie, the Winnie the Pooh movie, at home, like, in my house, I probably wouldn't have laughed so much but everything just seemed so much, like, exaggerated on the big screen, you know.  
R:  You do.
L:  Yeah, like you catch on things, like, quicker and better than you would if you were watching it at home with all the distractions, you know, but it was just so -- it was so funny.  Oh, I was just -- I would watch it again, it was so funny.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm gonna have to check that one out [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, yeah, you can rent it when it comes out.  I think --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  --they've stopped playing it at most theaters, you know, but, um, what else is out right now anyway?
R:  Mhm, let's see.  There is -- gosh, that's a good question [LAUGH].
L:  Did you see Anger Management?
R:  No, now I was wanting to see that though.
L:  Yeah, I wanted to see that too but unfortunately I didn't make it to the theater in time.  That looks funny.  That looked really, really funny.
R:  I mean, you -- you have just, uh, one young child or ...
L:  Yeah, I have one.  I have -- I just have one.  Yeah.
R:  So, I mean that makes it kinda hard to get out --
L:  Yeah, because we didn't --
R:  -- to the movies then, doesn't it?
L:  Yeah, exactly.  We haven't been to the movies in a long, long time and the last two that we've seen were, like, kid oriented movies, you know, --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because it's hard to -- yeah, because I don't have anybody really near by to me that I could just drop my daughter off to and go out to the movies but, um, you know, so it -- it makes it a little difficult but, you know, the two movies that we did see we went as a family and it was fun.  The both movies were really funny, you know.
R:  That's [LAUGH] [inaudible] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because I don't have any kids but I imagine once I do, it's gonna, you know, seriously limit what I can watch [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, yeah.  I think this -- these two movies were the first movies I've seen in four years.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh no.
L:  And that's because she's older now, you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and she can sit in a movie theater and she knows that she should be quiet but otherwise it's -- it's -- you know, it was hard.  It was hard, yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, what do you thing of, like, parents who bring in really young children to--
L:  I think that's so --
R:  -- the movies.
L:  -- irritating.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I remember I went to --
R:  [NOISE] No, go ahead I can hear you.
L:  Oh, okay.  I thought that was them saying it's ten minutes.  It should have been ten minutes by now, right?
R:  You know, what, I -- I forgot to look at the clock.  It might have been.
L:  Me too.  Me too but, um --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We could just finish up and we'll wait to see if they say something else.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Um, yeah was this one time where I went into the movie theater to see, like, an ethnic movie and, like, all these other people -- all these people come in with like -- with, like, little children and, like, one had actually had an infant with her and I just could not --
R:  No.
L:  -- imagine.  I was just like, "Oh, my God.  Like how do you do that, you know?"  Like doesn't the noise in itself, the music and everything scare the child, you know.
R:  Definitely.
L:  And I think it's such a disruption.  I think it's very unfair.  That's why I was so glad when that new law came out with the cellphones as well, you know, because I think anything that interferes with other people's, um, uh, attention and -- and, you know, distract -- and distracts other people is -- is unfair, you know.
R:  You have a law now in New York where you can't talk on a cellphone.
L:  Yeah, we have laws in --in, uh -- in, uh, New York that you can't have a cellphone in the movie theater.  If you're caught with a cellphone that goes on, you're fined like a hundred dollars or something.
R:  That's great.  That's great.
L:  And we have --
R:  I would say that's one of the worst things --
L:  Yes, and we have --
R:  -- about going to a movie.
L:  -- laws about, like, cellphones a lot.  Like now, we can't drive and -- and have a cellphone on at the same time.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, if -- if we're caught talking on the phone while we're driving, we're fined.  We get a ticket and we get a really nasty ticket too.  A really -- you know.  I think it has points and everything.
R:  That's great.  We really need that here [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it's -- I -- I know -- yeah, it's seriously -- but you know what the funny thing is?  I was driving -- I was on the highway and [LAUGH] I can't tell you how many people I -- I pass that are still talking on the cellphones.  They --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- just -- they do not obey the law [LAUGH].
R:  Even with a law, you can't rip it out of their hands.
L:  I know, I know.  It's so funny.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And to think like as teenagers growing up -- I mean, I don't know how old you are, but like, you know, when I was growing up, like, ten years ago as a teenager I was -- there were -- cellphones were like a -- a big thing, you know.  Like if you had one, you were, like, upper class, you know.
R:  I swear today at the movies I saw an eight year old with a cellphone.
L:  You're kidding.
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  Oh my God.  That is so funny.
R:  He pulled out a wallet with money and got some food and he checked his cellphone.  He couldn't have been more than eight years old [LAUGH].
L:  Oh my God. That is so funny.  Are you sure it wasn't a toy phone?
R:  No, it was --
L:  It was the real thing?
R:  -- it was one of those little Nokias you know.  They're so --
L:  Oh my God.
R:  -- so recognizable.  Yeah, I couldn't believe.
L:  Wow, and the new phones are getting so high tech.  Have you seen them?
R:  I've -- I've seen like on TV.  I haven't seen any --
L:  Oh my God.  You should stop by like at a Voicestream counter or something or T mobile counter.  AT&T they have some nice phones.  Wow [LAUGH].
R:  Like the picture phones or ...?
L:  Yeah, like just, like, really funky flip phones and just phones that like really they're so cool and so tiny too, you know.  Very, very cool.
R:  Uh, see I've only had my phone for a year.  It's already obsolete [LAUGH].
L:  I know.  My -- my husband's just waiting for that plan to just -- our plan to expire and he wants to get a new phone.  He's sick of the one we have [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
