R:  Ah, I've been getting, um, [MN] this is the third call I've gotten.
L:  Okay.
R:  And they all seem to be out your way kind of -- 
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- like in the -- in the mid west, ah -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- sort of.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's funny.  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, do you play computer games?
R:  No, not too much.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I do, um, [MN] sometimes the Solitaire, you know, and -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- my son plays computer games so I play them a little bit.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.  So -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- ah, I know a few of them but I don't play them very often.
L:  Okay, I -- 
R:  Do you?
L:  -- I used to be a big time gamer a while ago.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah, like -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you know, we used to play a lot of games on the internet and compete, you know, with the people on the internet.
R:  Oh.  What kind of games?
L:  Um, well I used to play a lot of Scrabble on line.
R:  Oh.  Oh -- 
L:  And -- 
R:  -- now that would be fun.
L:  Yeah, it used to be a lot of fun.  Very -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- competitive.  But -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- a lot of fun.
R:  Yeah.  Is there like a website you go to?
L:  Yeah.  There is a -- a Scrabble club, um, and if you just -- in -- I don't remember the website off my -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- mm, head, but if you just type scrabble club on -- in Google.
R:  Oh.  Uh-huh.
L:  You should, ah, get the website right on top.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah, and it's -- it's really a lot of fun and -- 
R:  Interesting.
L:  Yeah, and then there were a couple of the Destructor games I used to play which is, um, Doom.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Doom.  Oh -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I've heard of that but I have no idea how you play that.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Now I think it's just, you know, way too violent but [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Yeah.  Oh, how funny.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, that's -- Doom is, ah, like a capturing game or -- 
L:  Yeah, it's like, you know, mm -- yeah, it's -- it's a violent game.  You -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you have a shoot [inaudible] -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and things like -- 
R:  Oh -- 
L:  -- that.
R:  -- well we -- we play that on the TV, you know, like the -- 
L:  Ah, yeah.
R:  -- Play Station and that sort of thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like James Bond kind of stuff and -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- but nothing too graphic.  [LAUGH] 
L:  But, I like Solitaire.  Like I said, it's -- it's just, um, you know -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I just installed this Millenium.
R:  Oh.
L:  Windows Millenium.  And they have this Spider Solitaire. 
R:  Oh.
L:  It is so addictive.  Oh, my gosh.
R:  Really?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, and it's so much fun.  It's exactly -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- like Solitaire except, um, a lot more tougher.
R:  Oh.  Oh.
L:  But it's fun.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] 
R:  Oh, that sounds interesting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, and one of the things I might do like at work during the lunchtime is, um, do a crossword puzzle on -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- on the computer, yeah, which is kind of neat, you know? 
L:  Was that on the internet?
R:  Yes.  Mhm.
L:  Cool.
R:  Yeah.  I think it's -- ah, what is it called?  [MN] I don't know.  I just went to a game -- you know, like the thing like you said.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And just typed in crossword puzzles or games and -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, see what they had.
L:  Are you able to ever complete any of them?
R:  Yes.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, cool.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then it -- it lights up in all different colors when you get -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  --everything finished.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, wow.  I've -- I've never been able to complete one -- 
R:  Oh, really? 
L:  -- [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.  Yeah.
L:  I'm bad at it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, I like doing them and, ah, I guess if -- if I get really stuck, you know, you can get a hint or a -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- you -- they will fill in one word.  They don't -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you know, yeah, I don't complete all of them but if I get really stuck on one and I just have to know, then you can get one word filled out or you can get a letter, you know, or you can get the whole thing if you really want to.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah, if you give up entirely they just fill it in for you.
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  Yeah.  But, ah, usually I'm pretty good at getting it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, I think I'd like the Scrabble because I like word games, you know -- 
L:  Mm, I love word games.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's -- that's the best thing for me.
L:  Yeah.  In fact on MSN, like, in -- every time I check my Hotmail account and it's -- like I sign out, it takes me back to the main page.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  They have these word games like, ah -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- Twister and, ah, um, what's it called?  Twisted.
R:  [NOISE] Twisted?
L:  Yeah.
R:  How do you do that one?
L:  It's -- it's a word game again.  It, ah, brings up, ah, eight tiles.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's like Scrabble and then on your -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- left you have, like, ah, maybe twenty, um, boxes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like twenty words that you can fill out, you know?
R:  Oh.
L:  Empty spaces.  So, you have to -- and there's one word which uses all eight tiles.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, you have to get that one word to go -- go onto the next stage.
R:  Oh, I see.  Oh -- 
L:  And then you've been making all these three letter, four letter words, you know?
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay -- 
L:  But, you have to get the other one eight letter word.
R:  Oh.  I think I played something like that once.  That was really hard though.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think I had, like, a demo and I only had it for a certain amount of time.
L:  That's right, yeah.
R:  Yeah, and once the demo expired I didn't pay for it so -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, yes, and another one I like, now that I'm thinking about it is Yahtzee which, um, is on a CD, ah --  
L:  Oh.
R:  -- CD rom.  Yeah.
L:  How's that?
R:  That one's a lot of fun, um, and you can do [MN] all different types of the dice -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- if you -- if you've ever played Yahtzee, you know, you -- you throw the dice. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they have, like, six sided dice and -- and just all different versions of Yahtzee that you can play.
L:  Wow.
R:  And I -- we really like that one.  We -- 
L:  Is it -- 
R:  -- we kind of go through stages in my family.  We'll get it and play it for a while and then move on to something else.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  I know, my -- my husband and myself, we just got, ah, the Scrabble board game, you know -- 
R:  Oh.  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- so, 'cause they play on the internet all the time and he's like, "All right, you play with me".
R:  Ah, yes.
L:  [LAUGH] --  
R:  [LAUGH] He wants to get in on it too.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  That's funny.  [LAUGH] [NOISE] -- 
L:  So, yeah, but when I'm alone it's -- it's a very good way to kill time.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you have kids?
L:  No.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  We -- we just got married, so -- 
R:  Oh, did you?
L:  Yeah -- 
R:  Oh, congratulations.
L:  Thank you.  So, we're -- 
R:  Ah.
L:  -- just getting into the game thing.
R:  Yes.  Yes.
L:  You know, we -- we went and bought a couple of oth- other games, um, it -- 
R:  That's nice.  Yeah.
L:  But, we just haven't gotten down to that yet.
R:  Yeah, we do that.  Um, I have three kids actually.  So, they're a little bit older now but we still -- every once in a while we have a game night -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and we actually -- you know, we've -- we've even spent like New Year's Eve doing that, you know?
L:  Oh, wow, that's -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- fun. 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, and -- and we all like playing it and [NOISE] so, yeah it's a nice way for everybody to be together and -- 
L:  Another game I play on line is Boggle.
R:  [MN] Boggle.
L:  Yeah, it's -- 
R:  Oh, really?  Oh -- 
L:  Have you played that?
R:  Mm, [MN] I'm not sure if I've ever -- 
L:  You know it -- 
R:  -- played that.
L:  -- it has, like, it's a box with, I think, four by four -- sixteen cubes.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And each cube has four letters printed on each side like a dice.
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  Like, A. -- 
R:  Letters?
L:  -- B. and -- 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- it -- and then you take that box and shake it up really well.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then you know all the cubes settle down in their squares.
R:  Okay.
L:  And there's a timer -- a one minute timer.  So, o- once you open the box -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, you know, how many other players are playing in the one minute have to make words.
R:  Oh, in one minute.  Oh -- 
L:  From the jumble.
R:  -- I see.  And -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- whoever makes the most wins.
L:  Yeah, and then there're some rules that you can't just pick up any word.  It -- it has to, you know, be a sequence.  It has to be diagnosed to the other -- like, if I picked up one letter, like let's say N. then I can make words only with -- with the ones that are r- -- diagonal and, ah -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- the one next to it.
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay -- 
L:  And -- 
R:  -- it has to be -- 
L:  -- yeah.
R:  -- connected.
L:  Connected, oh -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- that's the word.
R:  Oh, okay.  I see.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, that sounds like fun.  And you can just go to the website.
L:  Yeah, you can go to the website.  It's the same -- in -- in -- in fact it's the same website as the Scrabble Club.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  They have a Boggle Club.  You -- 
R:  Boggle, oh.
L:  -- can see they're all word games that they have.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, that sounds like fun.
L:  Mm.
R:  Yeah, I like that.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, well -- 
L:  Totally interesting.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, very good.  [MN] Yeah, my -- my -- like I said my son, he plays a lot of the, um -- 
L:  Does he stay -- 
R:  -- he's eight.
L:  -- up really late playing games?
R:  Um, no, he's only eight.  So -- 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- yeah, he -- he's only playing the, um, [MN] well, what does he play?  Like, the SIMS.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  We got that and all my kids are into that.  My -- my eight year old is my youngest one.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, my two older girls, they, um, they like to play that too and they just all take turns and --  
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you know, you -- you create homes and families and they all have their own little families.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, that's the SIM City.
R:  SIM -- well, it's, ah, the SIMS.  [MN] Like, they have SIMS Vacation and -- and SIMS Party.  They have a whole bunch of them now.
L:  Oh, okay.  I thought -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they had just one.
R:  Oh, no, no.  It -- it's gotten bigger and -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- they have like, um, more things that you can do with it.
L:  Mm.
R:  And you can have different, ah, equipment.  Like for the parties they have, like, a bar set up or a pool and -- and you can do all sorts of things, you know?
L:  Oh, fun.
R:  Yeah.  It really is.  And you create homes and you can, you know, put down the rugs and the wallpaper and everything's up to you.
L:  Oh, my gosh, that's -- 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  -- really detailed.  [LAUGH] 
R:  It is very detailed.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And then it's up to you to take care of the SIMS, you know, the people that you created because they get tired and they get hungry and you have to make sure that they get fed and [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Oh, wow -- 
R:  -- it's very -- yeah.
L:  -- this is really interesting.
R:  It is.  It is.  And if they get too tired then they just fall on the floor.  It's so funny.  They'll say, "Oh" and they fall on the floor.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Or if they have to go to the bathroom, you know, they -- they -- they'll go to the bathroom right on the floor -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- if you don't get 'em to the bathroom.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, my gosh, this is funny.
R:  So, yes, it's -- 
L:  So, do you just -- ah, do you just buy these games or download them?
R:  Ah, we bought a couple of them.  They -- they're like the Christmas presents and birthday presents -- 
L:  Oh, nice.
R:  -- and, yeah, because they're like fifty dollars each, you know, so you can't -- 
L:  Oh, that's expensive.
R:  Yeah, you can't buy them too often.  But -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, if you get one or two a year, you know -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it -- it -- it lasts.
L:  Keeps you occupied for a bit.
R:  Yes.  Yes.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Once they get involved in it, boy they're there for hours, you know?
L:  [inaudible]
