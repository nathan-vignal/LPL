L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hi, my name is Gail and I'm from Brooklyn.
L:  Hi, my name is Amy and I'm from Texas, but this isn't Amy, this is her mom.  She's on her way in for the phone.
R:  Okay. [LAUGH] 
L:  I was trying to get her in before it connected up, but she was outside.
R:  Okay.  
L:  Are you doing okay? [NOISE] [PAUSE] Everything's all right in Brooklyn?
R:  Oh, sure, sure, you?
L:  Yes, [NOISE] we're down here on the coast near Galveston, Texas. [NOISE]
R:  Oh.
L:  And it's just beautiful.  We spent the day at the beach yesterday.
R:  Oh, boy.  Well, we -- we practically have on jackets here.  It's pretty cool. 
L:  [NOISE] Wow. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  I know we have some relatives in upstate New York and it was still snowing up there.
R:  Ooh. [inaudible] 
L:  Hang on just a second, here she comes --
R:  Okay. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] [PAUSE] [NOISE] [NOISE] Hello.
R:  Hi, Amy, this is Gail.  How are you?
L:  [NOISE] Fine, how are you?
R:  I'm okay. 
L:  That's good. 
R:  Yeah, and the topic is on computer games, um, I don't play any. [LAUGH] 
L:  I play games a lot, but I'll never do it on CD rom, I always do it online.
R:  Okay, online.  So, how is it?  How are they? 
L:  They're fun. 
R:  Okay.  [inaudible] 
L:  I like -- I like games.  I like to play games that are live, you know. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, 'cause I'm not really a big, ah, athletic person, but, you know, if you like bowling or pool --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- they have really good games for them on Yahoo. 
R:  Ooh, that's good to know.  Okay, I'll write that down.  Maybe I'll [several inaudible words].  Okay, Yahoo.  All right, good.  All right, ah, well, I -- I'm kinda, like [MN] this topic [MN] I don't know anything. [LAUGH] I'm really dumbfounded, so maybe I'll let you do all the talking.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, a- are there, like, any games, like, that you like to play in real life?
R:  Ye- --
L:  Or ...?
R:  Yeah, the bowling, mhm.
L:  Yeah, the bowling one they got on, um, Yahoo is real cool.
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because, ah, you get to pick your ball in the beginning --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and you can pick what type weight you want on it.
R:  Mm.
L:  And, um, when it comes up it's got a thing that looks like your lane, and you can pick from two different bowling alleys, and you pick your lan- -- or you pick the bowling alley and you get a lane and there'll be, like, people beside you, but you can't see the people --
R:  Oh, okay. 
L:  -- because you can see, like, the two lanes on the other sides of you when they bowl, you can see 'em getting a strikes and stuff.
R:  Wow.  Okay, that sounds like fun.  Oh, right, you don't have to have a whole lot of people, just you -- just you and the game.
L:  Yeah, it can be just -- you can have, like, one player or you can have, like, four players.
R:  Mm.  Mhm. 
L:  I found out that, like, wherever your mouse ends up in the end is where your ball is going to go.  'Cause you wanna try to keep it straight when you're going towards --
R:  The mouse.
L:  -- the pins.
R:  Okay.  Okay.  That makes sense.  Hm, oh, I'm gonna -- I'm gonna check this out and see what's going on with this bowling thing here. Yeah --
L:  Yeah, Yahoo games. 
R:  Yahoo games. 
L:  You got the Yahoo email address?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, Yahoo games.
R:  Mhm, okay.
L:  And they got -- I like pool too.  Like, a lot of people play the Yahoo pool and they do it to, like, do leagues and stuff, you know, to win money or whatever.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  But it's just a pretty fun game to play, you know, without trying to get money or something.
R:  Got it, got it, got it.  So -- so are there any other games that you play besides the bowling and the pool?
L:  Ah, sometimes I play the words games on M.S.N.
R:  See, I love word games, 'cause I do a lot of wor- -- the cross puzzles and the jumbles and all the stuff in the papers.
L:  Yeah --
R:  So that's what --
L:  -- they have, ah, one called Text Twist on M.S.N. --
R:  Text --
L:  -- and it gives you, like --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- seven letters I think, 'cause -- or six letters, and, ah, it'll give you, like, it'll have, like, you -- you can only start making words, like, three letter words --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and, ah, it'll have, like, maybe let's say you can make eight three letters words, it'll have, like, eight of the three little boxes together --
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  -- in rows and so you can make a couple of four letter words, it'll have two boxes for the four letter words --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- so you know how many words you're supposed to make --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and, like, with how many letters --
R:  Mm --
L:  Yeah, that's pretty fun. 
R:  Wow.  Hey, I think I'm going to start playing games now. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, right.  So anyways, have you done any of these other surveys that they -- that they have?
L:  Um, ah, I did one before.
R:  Okay, which one?
L:  Ah, I don't remember what it was --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I'm so sorry. 
R:  Oh, okay.  That's okay.  Yeah 'cause I do -- I did two.  I did one on, um, the minimum wage and the -- the other one was on affirmative action.  And it was, wow, [LAUGH] it was pretty good.
L:  Well, but those are fun subjects, huh?
R:  Ah, well, they were pretty heavy. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's for sure. [MN] That's pretty heavy.  You know, affirmative action to me was the most difficult one, you know --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, it was, yeah, it was sort of like, disagreed a lot, which made sense [MN].  Anyway, that's enough of that.  Um, so how's it like in Galveston over there?
L:  Oh, it's -- I'm sitting outside and it's pretty warm.
R:  Mm. [inaudible] Well, we have on jackets here in Brooklyn, 
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Oh, yeah, it's -- it usually [inaudible] -- it usually gets pretty warm around [inaudible] Day.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It either rains or it gets really, really hot.  So we just hope that it gets really, really hot, 'cause after that it -- it'll be, like, straight into summer. 
L:  Oh, you -- you all get snow there, huh?
R:  Well, I -- I -- I heard that there's some upstate, but not here in Brooklyn, no.  No.
L:  Oh.  
R:  But we get snow a lot, yeah, yeah.  Tha- that's true. 
L:  We don't get any snow here.  I think, like, once, like, maybe eight years ago and I +wasn't living here at the time --
R:  You're kidding.
L:  But, ah, we live -- we -- it's not exactly in Galveston.  We live in Texas City, which is maybe twenty, thirty minutes away from Galveston.
R:  Okay. 
L:  And we live, ah, we have a thing in town called the Dyke.  And it's a man made, ah, like, I guess you'd call it a land thing going out.  And you can drive, like, five miles out on that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they got beaches off to old -- ah, the left side is mainly beaches and they got a couple of, um, piers where you can fish off of, and the other side they got these big square rocks lined up all along it and people park on there and fish.
R:  Mm.  Okay, wow, sounds pretty good.
L:  You can swim over there and do -- they got boat ramps, you can jet ski and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- take your boat out and ...
R:  Wow.  Well, that sounds pretty good.
L:  We live by, um, the gulf so it's -- it's -- we get good breezes and stuff --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but it gets hot.
R:  Mm. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I went to Texas years ago.
L:  Well, if I weren't wearing shorts right now, I would be pretty hot --
R:  Oh, my --
L:  -- in pants.
R:  -- goodness.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I know, I went years ago -- I forgot what part, but I tell, like, eleven o'clock in the morning it was, like, unbearable.  And that's, like, eleven o'clock in the morning. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It gets pretty hot here.  
R:  Oh, okay.  Any --
L:  Where, just about everyone here already has their air conditioners going.
R:  Mm. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] We all have window units in and, ah, everything.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Okay.  So these, um, mm -- I don't have too many [inaudible] I don't know about you, but I don't have too much more to say about these computer games that I don't know anything about.  Except what you told me. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh. [LAUGH] [NOISE] Well, yeah, they're pretty fun.  I mean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like, if you're bored and you have time --

R:  Right.
L:  Well, like, on most of the five somethings I think it was, they had the game where you, ah, matched the eight and the five and the two and the three, you know --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- and they have to add up to thirteen.
R:  Okay.
L:  They have one on there called something Pyramid and I play that every once in a while and it's cards and you --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- match 'em up to thirteen.
R:  Okay.
L:  That site you get, like, points on.  
R:  Okay. 
L:  And I guess they entered it -- I've never entered my points, I just like playing the games, but you, like, enter your points for, ah, tickets, like, in drawings every week or whatever.
R:  Okay.  Okay.  Mm.
L:  [NOISE] They're pretty fun for card games.
R:  Okay.  Okay, good.  That's good to know --
