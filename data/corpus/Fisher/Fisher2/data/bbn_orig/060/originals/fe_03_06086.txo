L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, this is Laurie.
L:  Hi, this is Jennifer.
R:  Hi.
L:  Ah, so do you -- do you play video games?
R:  I actually don't.  [LAUGH] Do you?
L:  Um, not very often.  I don't really have much time for video games or computer games or anything.  So -- 
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I've actually really never played computer games.  I've played games on the, um, I guess the Play Station and like the Nintendo and [several inaudible words].  [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, ah, computer wise, never played any computer games besides, like, what it comes with, I guess Solitaire or something at work.
L:  Yeah, when I -- when I first got my computer, ah, four or five years ago I did, um, I used to go on line and do, like, ah, on line Chess and on line Checkers and stuff with other people across the country and stuff and it was actually kind of cool.  We -- we -- we could even play games like Hearts and that kind of thing, you know, like interaction, you could [several inaudible words].  That's the sport where you can tackle the people.  I know it was fun.  But, sometimes it was, like, you'd look up and you'd see, like, three or four hours had gone by you'd just [LAUGH] wasted.  A big chunk of time.  So, I stopped doing it quite a bit.  So, now I don't even go -- go on line very much any more at all.
R:  Oh, wow.  So, you actually have done some of the, like, games I guess that they -- that the little message we're talking about, like, on line with other people then?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, well, I've never done that.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  It was -- it was actually pretty fun.  I would enjoy doing it, like, if it was, you know, people I knew from -- I -- I -- I have friends spread all across the whole United States.  I mean, I used to -- you know, incorporate, you know, all meet [inaudible] whatever game sites and -- 
R:  Wow.  So -- 
L:  -- enjoy it, but -- 
R:  -- so you could, like, get together with people that you knew -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and for -- pick a game to play.
L:  Yeah, then -- then you'd all meet at the web -- website and all sign in and, um, depending on what website and stuff it was on you could, um, you could actually -- 
R:  [several inaudible words] 
L:  -- see the other names sign up on -- in, like, a game room.
R:  Okay.
L:  And you could go in there and -- I mean, you could play any games you wanted.  Hangman or whatever.  I mean, it was just like a whole game site.  I don't even remember what it was anymore.  It's been four years, but -- 
R:  Wow -- 
L:  -- yeah.
R:  -- yeah.  Yeah, somehow I never got into anything like that.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't know how I missed it but I -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- guess I was too busy, ah, with, ah, my college work or something to ever figure out that there were people on line playing games.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Or I might have been sucked into it too.  [LAUGH] It could have been bad.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, it -- it does, ah, ah, exactly, suck you in [LAUGH] and -- 
R:  Mm.  Well, I guess, like, I've heard about people getting together and playing games on line.  I -- I'm trying to think of, like, the controversial ones or something.  I -- Zoom is what I hear about.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Like, I've heard about that before, like on the news or something.  Have you ever heard of that -- that game?
L:  I -- I've heard of that game.  I've never played that one though.
R:  Uh-huh, yeah.  It's, I think, more of a boy game.  I don't know.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I think so.
R:  That's what it -- that's what it seems like.  So, I -- but I guess they get together and play scenes like that and I -- I don't know what my cousin does but he's in high school and he just spent [MN] -- I think my grandmother told me four thousand dollars on -- on a new computer that he could pl- -- so he could play games on line.  And I don't know what he's playing on line.  But, he needed this, like, a special computer that was able to, like, really do all this stuff so he could have a better chance of winning or something.  So, he spent, like, all of his money that he had saved up.  But, usually in my family you use that as -- as, like, the college spending money but he just spent his on this computer in high school which has caused, like, this huge thing in my family because everybody feels like, you know, they have to be in everybody elses business anyway.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Sorry?
R:  So my, um, you know, grandmother [several inaudible words] pretty upset that they wasted all this money just for these computer games.  So, that's pretty much as far as my experience [LAUGH] with them goes.  I hear about them.  [LAUGH] [MN] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, um, do -- did you play the -- these games, like, at work or at, like, your home?
L:  Um, ah, mostly -- like, the on line ones and stuff I usually just do it from my home computer.  Um, like I -- at work on my breaks and stuff I might, you know, pop up a quick game of solitaire or something.  But -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for the most part, um, at my work, um, the way my schedule was I sometimes even had to work through lunch.  So, I really didn't get much -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of a chance to do it there.  But -- 
R:  Yeah.  I've only worked at places where they were monitoring what you were doing on your computer -- 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- anyway.  [LAUGH] So, [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Yeah, [several inaudible words].  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- it wasn't like you could do anything, like, personal on your computer 'cause somebody would, like, step up to your desk and be like, "What are you doing?" [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Very interesting.
L:  Yeah, see I -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I grew up with more the -- I mean, I still have my Atari and Sega system and some of the games that went with those and those are -- 
R:  Yeah, we had the -- 
L:  -- the kind of games I grew up on.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  We had the Atari too.  That's the other one.  And we had the -- before the Atari there was like the Sontella[?] in television I think it was.
L:  Okay -- 
R:  And I don't know if you r- remember that one, but -- 
L:  I remember, but we didn't -- we -- the first game, sort of, that we could afford was the -- was the Atari when it came out.  So, I remember seeing it and -- but I didn't -- I -- we never had that one.
R:  We used to play Spitball[?] all the time.  That was -- 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- the game -- that was the game that we played on that.  [LAUGH] And then there was some other game that was like a disease, like medical game where you went in and you were trying to, like, kill bacteria and stuff -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- in somebody's body and it would keep telling you, like how your patient was doing, like you're -- and eventually your patient --
L:  Oh, that's kind of -- 
R:  -- would die.
L:  -- cool.
R:  Yeah.  Well, it was interesting but we didn't have the instructions, like -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I -- we couldn't figure out like what we were really ever supposed to be doing and of course, like my brother and I were probably like nine at the time so we really had no clue.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, we would just be travelling in this, like, spaceship kind of inside somebody's body and of course it was like totally eighties, like, you -- there were no graphics to it at all.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So, yeah, so those were the two games that I can remember playing and then with the Atari, I know we had some sort of, ah, the car game I guess like everybody had -- the racing -- 
L:  Oh, Night Driver.
R:  Yeah, sure, that must be it.
L:  That one.  [LAUGH] 
R:  And then my brother used to be really good at Pacman like -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- when he was two he started playing, like, on the little, like, um, I don't know, hand held, like, game [inaudible] that was shaped like Pacman.
L:  Okay -- 
R:  But, he used to, like -- he could beat everybody at, like, two and three years old, like, on Pacman.  He would -- 
L:  Wow.
R:  -- just sit there and play it constantly, like after his nap in the afternoon or something.  Yeah.  Yeah, my husband would probably know more about computer games --  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- but he doesn't play them either than I do.  That's one of those things that has passed me by.  I could never really get into it.
L:  Yeah, well, I know, it's just how -- I mean, different computers from, ah -- and I grew up mostly working on, like, a word processor kind of thing -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- where you'd -- you'd -- you know, you'd play the games all on disk and nothing would come with the computer and there'd be, you know, like little stick figures or very just black and white -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- kind of thing.  So, now when you get on the -- the internet basically, I mean, you could be slowly moving real people around the screen as if -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, ah -- 
R:  Ah, did you have, like -- 
L:  -- the technology -- 
R:  -- ah, were you using a dial up when you were playing?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I was wondering if you did that or a cable modem just because I didn't even think I could play any games 'cause we only have a, um, a dial up connection and we just lose connection all the time, like, over the phone line.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I don't think I could ever --
L:  Yeah, that would not be good.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- play any game.  [LAUGH] Um, I'm trying to think of any other thing I know about computer games besides what I've already said.  But, [MN] I'm just pretty much out of the loop in that situation.
L:  Yeah.  I've noticed a lot of them lately, I mean, even just going to, like, toy stores and looking at the video games that are out and -- and computer games that are available.  It -- they -- they have gotten a lot more violent [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, that's -- that's -- that's -- 
L:  -- than what I remember, you know what I mean?
R:  -- what I hear.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I hear about that on television and I guess, like, some of them have ratings now or something.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, some are -- are -- are rates, um, and actually even going, like, the -- like, the movie PG kind of thing whereas -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you know, you can't be -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- younger than thirteen if you want to play this game kind of thing.
R:  Yeah, I think I saw --
L:  It -- 
R:  -- a news story where Walmart, like, was one of the only places that was upholding the age ban thing on certain games so that when people came in -- like, kids would try to buy certain games and it would come up on the screen to ask them how old they were. 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And then if they weren't -- like, if their birthday wasn't, like, the right date and they couldn't purchase these games without an adult or something.  So, they must be pretty crazy.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Oh, that's -- that's -- that's -- that's actually kind of sad because I think, I mean, kids are the ones that are supposed to be playing these games, or y- you know, the majority of the people playing the games and when they have to be checking ID's on them or checking the ages on them to be able to pick up a game from a store that's, I mean, that's kind of [LAUGH] sad.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] 
R:  Yeah.  I guess I can remember, like, with Columbine too they were trying to say that -- I think Doom was the game that they were supposed to be, like, really into -- 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- and they were saying that that might have, like, contributed they thought to, like, their violence or there propensity towards violence or something.  But, I'm not sure I really can buy totally into all that.  I -- 
L:  Yeah, I think there's a lot of -- 
R:  -- guess if it becomes -- 
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- something that you're, like, constantly immersed in and if the game is taking over your life, I guess I could see that.  But, it's so hard for me to imagine because I just don't play any of these [LAUGH] games. 
L:  Yeah, I think it's more of, um, what's going on in their life more than what -- what they're playing or watching.  I mean it's -- it -- you have to let it affect you in order for it to [inaudible] you.  I mean it -- I mean, I -- I play video games all the time but I'm not going out --
