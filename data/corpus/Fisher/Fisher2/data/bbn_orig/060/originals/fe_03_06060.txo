R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, this is Pat.
R:  Hi my name's Paula.
L:  Paula?
R:  How are you?
L:  I'm fine.  Um, I guess our topic is the movies, whether you like to go to the theater or rent them and stay home.
R:  Yes.
L:  Actually I like to do both.  Um, it just depends on [COUGH] if there's something really, really good that's new that isn't out on tape yet then I -- I'll -- I'll go ahead and go to the movies but, um, sometimes I just like to wait till they come out on -- on video so that I can just watch 'em at home.
R:  That's kinda how I am.  I occasionally go to the movies if there's something that's really, really supposed to be good --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it's fun to go see it on the big screen.  Like I remember the, um -- well, I have teenagers so, of course, they've gotta go see the Star War movies [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, I -- yeah.  
R:  So, that's kinda fun -- those kind of, you know, where they have the big, you know, action packed and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, they're -- they're real bright and big so those are kinda fun to see at the theater but most of the time I prefer to rent movies and just do it at the house 'cause, you know, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I can put it on pause if I have to answer the phone or --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- run to the bathroom or --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- go get a snack.
L:  [LAUGH] What --
R:  That's easier.
L:  Um, what -- what's the last, um, movie that you actually went to a theater to see.
R:  Gosh, I was trying to remember be- you know, after I looked at this, trying to recall what the last one I went to the theater to see --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I -- you know, I honestly I can't remember.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I remember the last one I rented for the house was the Emperor's Cup -- Club.
L:  Oh, uh-huh.  Um, well --
R:  And that one's with Kevin Kline.
L:  Oh.
R:  So ...
L:  And that's the one you rented and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.  Um, I -- the last movie that I saw was just recently but before that, I -- I honestly don't remember either but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it was my birthday and my daughter took me -- uh, treated me to, uh, Chicago so, um, it was okay.
R:  What was it?
L:  Chicago.
R:  Chicago.
L:  Yeah, with Renee Zellweger and Queen Latifah.  Um, I guess it'd been a Broadway play before they made a movie of it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But this was, oh, almost a month ago now and before that I -- I really can't remember when I went to the theater and especially I won't go on a Saturday.  All the kids are --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- yelling and screaming and kicking the seats and --
R:  Throwing popcorn and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, whatever else happens to be flyable [LAUGH].
L:  That's true.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's not good to sit down front.  You never know what you're gonna get hit with.
R:  Absolutely not.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I sit in the very back [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Bring my glasses [LAUGH] so I can see [LAUGH].
L:  That's good too if it -- if it turns out to be nasty.  You can just get out of the -- get out without people seeing you walking up the aisle.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, 'cause I have walked out of a few movies --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, that have kind of been kind of grungy and so [LAUGH] --
L:  Well, I've even --
R:  -- I didn't think were funny.
L:  [LAUGH] I -- I've actually rented some that I didn't watch all the way through because the build up was so great but the movie itself just, you know, really wasn't that bigger deal.
R:  Yeah.  Usually mine is if it's just kind of, you know, really crude.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- you know, I don't find that particularly funny.  Like --
L:  No.
R:  -- I don't like Jim Carrey [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, oh, I'm so glad to hear you say that.  I think I'm the only other person in the world --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that can't stand him.
R:  I -- I know.  I understand that because everybody in my house thinks he's hilarious and I think [NOISE] -- you know, my daughter doesn't like him too much but everybody else does and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I'm just like, I cannot watch a movie with him in it.
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  I can't do it, you know.
L:  As a matter of fact, this past week he was, uh, being interviewed on Oprah's show and I turned it off.  I just can't stand to watch him.  There's something so wrong about him [LAUGH].
R:  I know and, you know, he actually --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- gets paid money for that [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] I know, and look we -- we work our buns off and we can't make any money at all.
R:  No, we can't make ends meet and so we're always finding other ways to do it and, you know, and then these guys get up on these movies and act --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- really stupid and crude and obnoxious.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  And so ...
L:  He's -- he just reminds me of somebody who's put together with spare parts.  He just --
R:  Oh, I --
L:  -- doesn't look like a real human.
R:  Well, you know, I think it's kind of his personality 'cause he has that evil grin and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, and so --
L:  Jolly.
R:  -- I kinda like dramas better.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I'm kind of a -- you know, I like some comedies.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, if they're good and they're pleasant --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I like dramas.  You know, and I think that's why I like the Emperor's Club so well.
L:  Oh, great.
R:  It's a real pleasant movie and it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, it's kind of like, um, I'm trying to remember what that movie was.  It, um -- that had, uh, Robin Williams in it and it was a drama and he was a school teacher and --
L:  Um, Dead Poet's Society.
R:  Yes, it's --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- it's kind of like that.
L:  Oh, really.
R:  And if you like the Dead Poet's Society, you would love this one --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- because he's such an extraordinary man and -- and he -- what he teaches is about the Roman Empire, history and the Roman Empire.
L:  Oh.
R:  And, you know, Julius Caesar and all the people, you know, surrounding him and, you know, how he brings that to life for these students.
L:  Oh.
R:  And then all the kids grow up and he's an old man and just to see, you know, their viewpoint of him and -- and the things that he taught and what they remember from his class.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's a private school again --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like Dead Poet's Society. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  But it's really, really good.
L:  What was the name of the movie that he was in that where he was a doctor and he was cheering up all these kids that were in -- in for surgery?
R:  You know, I didn't see that one and I -- I remember there was one like that but I have no clue what that one -- I didn't get to see it.
L:  That's one that I had rented and for the life of me I can't think of the name of it but it was very -- it was very good.  He was good in that one also.
R:  Was he?
L:  Yeah, very.
R:  See I liked French Kiss.
L:  Yes.
R:  There's some language and stuff in it but it had a personality --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know through the whole show.  I mean, it was -- it was -- it was a cute personality.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They could have left out the, you know, language --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it would have been just fine but --
L:  Well, yeah, that's what I don't understand.  Why do they think that adding all of that makes the movie better?  You know, I'm sorry but I -- I'm -- I'm back in the days with, you know, like, um, the original, um, I think it was called An Affair to Remember with Deborah Carr.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It was, uh, um, that's what they based, uh, Sleepless in Seattle on.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I thought that was a cute movie.
R:  I did too.  I loved that movie and then there was -- there's another one that's along the lines of Sleepless in Seattle.  Do you remember?  I was asking my daughter.
L:  Oh.
R:  I was trying to figure out [NOISE].  We just saw it, that was really cute like that [NOISE].  Like Sleepless in Seattle, you know, where the guy and the girl meet each other --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- across the country and there's a new one that's out like that and I -- I saw it a few weeks ago.  The kids brought it home.  I'm not very good about remembering what I see.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I have -- you know, I kind of --
L:  Well, --
R:  -- you know, I watch 'em and I forget what they are and --
L:  I know.  If it happened more than twenty minutes ago, don't ask me.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's how I am too, but whatever it was, is a new one that's like that.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it's kind of a love story along those lines but it's -- it's funny and, um, but it -- it's not, like, full of language and sex --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and stupidity and stuff.  It's just real gentle --
L:  Do you remember --
R:  -- and has a sweet thought.
L:  -- who's in it?
R:  Gosh, I just can't remember who was in it and I just loved it too.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  The kids -- one of the kids brought it home to me [NOISE] --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- you know, and I just -- I can't recall but that one was really good.  It -- and it's new -- one of the new releases so, you know, it should be --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- easy enough to find. 
L:  Okay.
R:  But that's kinda the plot.  It's like the Sleepless in Seattle type thing.
L:  Oh, yeah I loved that movie.
R:  You know, and, uh --
L:  That little boy was so cute.
R:  Oh, he was darling.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, and I like shows like that that have --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- happy endings, you know.  Life is so full of garbage anyway.
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  Why watch something that just, you know, ends terrible anyway.  What's the point?
L:  I just -- I've gotten so I don't even really watch TV much anymore either.  I just can't stand all the language and the -- you know, you think what kind of, um, morals are -- do these people have and I -- I wouldn't want my kids to watch a lot of the stuff that's on and it turns me off.  I'm -- I'm way over twenty one but it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- turns me off.  I -- I don't see where that adds anything to the plot or anything else.
R:  Me either.
L:  Some of the older movies, remember they used to have such beautiful background music and now it's rap and hip hop and thank goodness, we probably can't understand the words.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].  I know, that's what happens when you get older.  You know, you don't understand anything anyways.
L:  [LAUGH] No.
R:  You don't live in Wyoming, do you?
L:  No, I'm in North Carolina.
R:  Oh, okay.  I live in Wyoming and I have a neighbor named Pat and your voice is real similar and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I thought I wonder if I'm talking to her.
L:  Oh, wouldn't that be funny?
R:  It would be really funny [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So ...
L:  Oh my God.
R:  I know.  I get -- you know, sometimes -- I never know 'cause you know like some of the people that, um, I expect to talk to on the phone --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- are -- some of them are off my RMC page.
L:  Oh.
R:  And so for the refunding and stuff because, you know, they do this stuff too and so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that's why, you know, you never can tell and so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- who --
L:  No, I'm not anywhere near you [LAUGH].
R:  No, you're clear on the other side of the country.
L:  Yes, I am.  I'm on top of a forty five ...
