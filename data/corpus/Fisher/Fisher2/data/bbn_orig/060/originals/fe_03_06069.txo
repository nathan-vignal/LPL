R:  Hi, I'm Joy.
L:  Hi, I'm Terry.  How are you?
R:  Good, and yourself?
L:  Fine.  Um, I'm not quite sure what I'm gonna be able to do with this topic because I'm not a big computer game person.  How about you?
R:  Uh, oh well then maybe I'll fill up a lot of space 'cause [LAUGH] I do play a lot of computer games.
L:  Oh, well okay.  Good.  That means I can ask a lot of questions.
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  I won't know much so we'll have a lot -- we will have a lot to talk about.
R:  Okay.  It's funny I, uh -- it's -- I don't consider myself a heavy user of computer games and I sort of break it down into like two categories.  Um, the kind where you're just sitting on the computer and you need to take a break and, you know, you play a game or two.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Something like solitaire or mine sweeper which comes with a lot of, uh, Windows.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, or occasionally I'll go to, uh, MSN dot com games because they have a lot of fun games like word puzzles or --
L:  Oh, now that looks --
R:  -- um.
L:  -- I'd be interested in those.
R:  Um.
L:  What kind of word puzzles do they have?
R:  They have this one that's really fun.  Um, what they do is they have -- give you a string of, uh, like six letters and you have to try to make as many words out of them as possible and it gives you this little grid or -- or set of lines to show how many words they project you can make of those six letters [MN] and you get bonus points if you get like -- if you make, you know, the six letters words.  Um --
L:  Oh, that sounds pretty good --
R:  -- but you know like --
L:  -- 'cause actually --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- 'cause I do like word games.  I play a lot of word games on paper.
R:  Oh, you do?
L:  Yeah.  I d- didn't think they had 'em on computer.
R:  They definitely do and then they have another one that's kind of like, um solitaire scrabble where they give you a set of, uh, oh, a set of letters that each letter is worth a certain number of points and then you build as many, um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- words attached to each other as possible and then --
L:  Oh, I used to --
R:  -- you hit this button and it scores and then it gives you a new set.
L:  Mhm, I used to play scrabble quite a bit too so that sounds like something I would be interested in.  But, you know, I really prefer playing games with people -- with other people so how --
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  -- do you -- now, what kind of ratio do you think you have playing games with other people as comp- compared to computer games?
R:  Um, I think that -- I mean, personally I have not played very many games on the computer with other people.
L:  No, I -- I mean, like, in person with other people.
R:  Oh, I love playing games, um, in general.  Um, I have, like, chess and, um, this game that's kinda like Othello.  It's played on a go board where you're --
L:  Yep, mhm.
R:  -- you have black and white chips.
L:  Yep.
R:  And I play that with my friend sometimes.  Card games I like to play a lot.  My friend, Mindy and I will play, um, rummy whenever we're just, like, sitting around chatting or waiting for other friends to show up and, um, I love playing games in general.  But, um, I remember in college there were people who played this game called Net Doom.  And Doom is a great computer game.  It's usually like played on a CD ROM, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I used to have Doom two and I would sit around and play that a lot.  It's easy to get -- you lose hours playing that.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know people who lose weight playing computer games.
L:  Oh, that's scary [LAUGH].
R:  I used to live with one.  Yeah, because he would stay up all night and he would go to bed around the time I would get up and he would just be logging [NOISE] off the computer where he'd be, you know, playing Sim City for the last six hours.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, but Net Doom is so funny because, you know, you're a character that goes around and there's lot of, uh, bad guys that shoot at you.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You have to try to open secret doors and when you play Net Doom and you're networked to some- to somebody else and you have several players that person is trying to kill you also and you're running around in this huge maze and, uh, it was funny because these two people were playing were Net Doom but they were in adjacent rooms, like, in college and my friends and I would just walk back and forth between the two rooms [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- watching them sneak up on each other.  It was a lot of fun.  Um, but I think, um, besides Doom I think my favorite, um, CD ROM game, um, was called Myst.  I don't know if you've heard of it at all.
L:  Yes, I have.  Mhm.
R:  It's a wonderful game because it's a single player game that's, um, entirely puzzles.  Like it -- there's no thing where you just have to sit and try to, like, work through it methodically.
L:  Well, what kind of puzzles?  Like, I'm not -- I assume you're not talking about word puzzles but what kind of ...
R:  Right.
L:  So, what -- give me an example.
R:  Um, [NOISE] you start off on an island and on the island there's, like, an observatory --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, and, um, uh, a house with a fireplace and a library and then a fountain with a miniature boat sunk in it and there's the pier with the bay.  And you have to go into the observatory, um, and then actually have to go into the house.  You get a particular code to go back to the observatory, punch in the code and it brings up a star chart.  You get the code from the star chart, go back to the library, look up the reference, um, and then it tells you how to rotate the -- the little ship in the fountain, the toy ship in the fountain.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You go to the fountain, turn that and then the real sunken ship in the bay comes up and then you can enter it and that will give you the key to get to the next level and it has lots of stuff like that where you have to go back and forth.  Get --
L:  That's right, yeah.
R:  -- codes from one place, apply somewhere else and it's somewhat intuitive and somewhat like it's -- it's just a bunch of hidden clues and it's so much fun because, uh, it really makes you think and it makes you think outside the box.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's like you can't just sit in the library and open each of the books and look through all of the pages.  Even though it will allow your character to do that --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- what it wants is that -- it wants you to go and find the clue so you know exactly where in the library to go --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to get that next clue.
L:  [MN]
R:  And, um, that -- it was really challenging.  It was really challenging and I think it's so useful too when games make you think outside the box like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um --
L:  So, do you still play that one?
R:  I don't because I had that disk on my Macintosh and my Mac died and the next computer I got was a PC.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  And then I -- and then I -- my friend got me Doom two for PC so [LAUGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so I switched to the shoot 'em up game which was just as fun in a totally different way.  But do -- do you, um -- do you use computers at work or at home?
L:  I don't have a computer at home.  I used to but I -- I just -- it was eating too much of my time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, I do have a computer at work.  I think that's sort of the thing.  I mean, you do it at work all day and I just want to do other things --
R:  Right.
L:  -- besides [LAUGH] sitting in front of a screen so, um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so in -- in -- I have to say though, I -- I know since my employers won't hear me, I work -- sometimes I have been know to play games, computer games, at work.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN] Um, solitaire, of course, which is what a lot of pl- people play and there's advanced forms of solitaire and some word puzzles and I can't remember -- somebody at one of the, um -- at an office I worked at on a temp basis --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- last summer was showing me some different word game sites which I can't remember anymore now but there was like honeycomb things.  They'd -- they'd fill in, new letters would drop in all the time and you had to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, click the mouse as many as possible to m- to spell words.  When you clicked on the letters they disappear but more would come in and then the better you were, the longer the words were and the more words you made, the fastest it would all get --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so you were rewarded for being good by getting more stressed.  So [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- um, that was sort of interesting and anyway short term -- short term on that one because when you start getting good at it, you get more and more stress so eventually you just say, "Okay that's it".
R:  Right [LAUGH].
L:  Um, no, not too many computer games.  Really, like I said, I prefer doing live ones with people, scrabble, card games, um, chess sometimes though I don't know too many people nearby that -- that play.  Um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- oh, some -- like some old fashioned -- I have this Victorian game of, um, of anagrams.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's written about --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- yeah, Jane Austen's and they play it at one point where you just have letters, cards with letters on them and, um, you try to make words out of them and people can steal your letters to make more words and then when --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you all run out of the pile, then whoever's got the most words, wins.  Um, I -- I used to like Trivial Pursuit [MN] but I won too much and people won't play with me anymore [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  But computer games -- now, I wonder -- I wonder -- I bet somewhere there's a trivial form of -- some kind of Trivial Pursuit on the computer --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- somewhere.
R:  I think that they have every kind of game, um, on -- on the Internet now that you can play with other people.  You can --
L:  I never --
R:  -- play Scrabble with other people on the Internet.
L:  Yeah, I -- I don't think -- I don't think my office would be real happy if  [LAUGH] I started doing that.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, but sort of fun.  Um, I've have to do a little Trivial Pursuit search tomorrow when I get into work.
R:  Uh, yeah.
L:  Yes, I'm sure it's out there somewhere.  Um, and my nephew loves computer games.  I'm -- he's always telling me about them and asking for them for his birthday and for Christmas.
R:  Nice.
L:  And he's a Myst -- he's a Myst fan.  Zelda, do you anything about Zelda?
R:  I've heard about Zelda.  I have not played it.
L:  Yeah.  That one actually sound sort of interesting, the little bits I heard about it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I just, you know -- I [MN] I -- I was a little, um, disappointed when I heard the topic because I'm a -- I'm a Victorianist really.  I -- I teach English and my specialty is nineteenth century and most of --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- the things I like to do [LAUGH].  You sort of become what you study I think.
