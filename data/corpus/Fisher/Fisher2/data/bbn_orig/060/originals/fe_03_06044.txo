R:  [NOISE] Hello.
L:  Hi. 
R:  Hi.
L:  I'm Barbara.
R:  I'm Sharon.  It's nice to meet you. 
L:  Oh, it's nice to meet you. 
R:  Hi.  So, I guess we're supposed to talk about movies. 
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  Okay, do you --
L:  Okay, do you like to go to the movies or would you rather stay home and -- and rent them?
R:  [SIGH] It kind of depends on the movies.  Um, [LAUGH] I don't know, I've -- I think maybe I would prefer to see them at home a lot of times, but some movies aren't available on video so ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's, ah, easier to go to the theatre in those cases.
L:  Oh --
R:  Do you have a preference either way?
L:  Pardon?
R:  Do you have a preference either way?
L:  Um, I usua- -- well, recently I have been going to the movies --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- because I'm involved with a -- a firm that evaluates movies theatres as --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- to cleanliness and, um --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- oh, and how the movie was ran and the trailers ran and so on.  And --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- what you do is you go -- you see the movie, you see it a number of times and, um --
R:  You see it at different theatres or you see it at the --
L:  Just at the one theatre.
R:  Okay.
L:  The last one was X Men Two, which I do not recommend. 
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I, ah, I'm not really big on mainstream movies too much, just, I don't know, it just doesn't seem like th- that worth it to me, to pay eight dollars to go and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- see one of those movies.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Um, you know, it's funny, I actually used to work at a movie theatre for a while, so I just got used to seeing, like you say, the movies again and again, so it's kind of interesting to think about how it would change from time to time, just how --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it's presented and who's working and all that sort of thing.  
L:  [NOISE] Okay, um --
R:  Is that your fulltime job doing that, or it is --
L:  Oh, no, no, no --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- no, um, otherwise as far as, um, getting movies to bring home --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I get them at the library or --
R:  Yeah, I do too. 
L:  -- [inaudible] great, great, great while, um, someone in my family goes to Blockbusters, but most of the time I get the libr- -- um, the movies from the library.  
R:  Yeah, I do too.  It's so mu- -- well, our library still charges, like, a dollar fifty or so to get them, but it's so much cheaper than going to Blockbuster. 
L:  Mhm.  But we're free. 
R:  Okay.
L:  And, um --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- except when they're late, then they charge you.
R:  Okay --
L:  But --
R:  -- yeah.
L:  -- um, but it's -- it's worth it.  'Cause they -- the library gets the ones of -- most of the -- the latest ones about three months after Blockbusters, so, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if you're willing to wait, it's a terrific -- terrific deal.
R:  Yeah, it's really a great thing.  And I think that there's -- I like that if they don't have something, they'll order it for you from another library or, yo- you know, they can put in a special order for it or something, so ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  It is handy.  Do you look for certain types of movies or do you just rent, like, whatever's new to the library or ...?
L:  Um, okay, I'm --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I rent what's n- new to the library, if I am going to get one.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, and, um, [LIPSMACK] a- and some of them -- a- and sometimes it -- people will tell me, "Well, I liked this movie" or, "You should really, really see, um, see that movie".
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, I'm trying to remember what [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and som- -- and sometimes they'll tell me, ah, "Don't see that movie, it's --"
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  "-- a little bit too raunchy for you".
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, um, so I don't . 
R:  Okay, so what was the last movie that you saw?
L:  Ah, I saw the X Man Two, and the one before that was Anger Management.
R:  Oh, okay, okay.  And how about from the library?
L:  From the library, oh, that was a long time ago.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, possibly Grumpy Old Men, or Grumpier Old Men. 
R:  Okay, huh.
L:  How about you?
R:  Ah, the last movie I saw in the theatre, I think, was this movie called Black Box.  Um, I live in Philadelphia and they just had this international film festival thing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, ah, it was an Argentinean film that came and was pretty interesting, so ...
L:  Okay, oh, that sounds interesting.  [inaudible] 
R:  Yeah, it kind of -- it's crazy because it's just this jam packed two week time when everything is just like --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- crazy, crazy, you know, you just have to go, like, four times a day.  Which I didn't do, but it's still -- it's interesting to have that possibility, so we went a couple times and then, ah, I think the last movie I rented or got from the library was, ah, True Stories.  It's, um, the guy -- I don't know if you know the Talking Head musical group, but they, um -- the guy who sings for them made this film which is [LAUGH] -- it was really --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- sort of wacky, but, yeah, so I usually try to see movies that people either recommend to me or I read something about them or look [LAUGH] -- I don't know, the cover looks interesting or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't know. 
L:  Well, [LIPSMACK] I know, I went to Anger Management -- the Anger Management title [inaudible] --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- feeling --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- 'cause I know people who are taking anger management --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- classes.
R:  Right.
L:  And, um, I wanted to see what it was -- wh- what was going on in their --
R:  Right.
L:  -- lives.  And, um, [LIPSMACK] it was very in- -- i- it's funny.  It's about this mild mannered guy who actually takes an anger management cla- -- gets misassigned to an anger management class and he, ah, eventually becomes very angry --
R:  Oh, no.
L:  -- with the, um, girl of the anger management classes is -- my step daughter is in an anger management --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- class --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- 'cause she -- 'cause if -- she -- her temper erupts it's not too -- she's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- usually, say, she erupts like a volcano and then she --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- ah --
R:  -- yeah.
L:  -- it's too bad.  It's -- she throws things --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- like chairs --
R:  Okay. 
L:  -- and, um --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- so she's taking anger management.  And I asked h- -- I asked her, I suggested to her that she go see the film --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and she looked at me and she said, "Why?"  I said --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- "Oh, no, but it's funny, it really is", and it --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- to enjoy it.
R:  Was she, ah -- do you get to choose those movies, or do you just have to go to the ones that they assign to you, for the ones --
L:  Um --
R:  -- that you're looking at the theatre for?
L:  Okay, for -- all right, for the -- the first one, the Anger Management one, I was al- -- I had to choose what movie I got to see.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, [inaudible] now, for the blind check, which means you go -- go to the movie and you count the seats in the auditorium and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and then you count the people going into the movie and, um, report that to the, um, per- -- people who were, [MN] um, [SIGH] assign --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- assigned me the jobs.
R:  Okay.
L:  A- and, um, and then you get to s- -- to see the movie, they like you to s- -- buy a set number of tickets, and it's just makes you -- oh, to do blind checking, it's better to buy tickets for all the shows, if --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- you don't --
R:  -- okay.
L:  -- it's difficult and --
R:  Oh, huh.
L:  -- and it's been two that way and then we were -- I'm doing something else for the same company later on, ah, to see how the, um, refreshment stands --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- people worked.  And if they do a good job, um, you know, and pleasant and efficient or whatever, um, I get to give them a certificate for money.  If not --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- just go my merry way, but they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- give you tickets for those movies, too.
R:  Oh.  That's such a good thing.  I like to think that you have the po- -- the potential to do something positive for them, instead of just, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- "Oh, I'm here spying on you, you know, doing this --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- thing" and then going some [inaudible] so ...  Huh, that's interesting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, is it, like, a market research group or something?
L:  Market research, um --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- you, um, yes, ah, there's a couple of them out there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, the one I work for and the other one I just signed up for and, um, if you go to -- [inaudible] you go to the movies and, um, sometime you see how the crowd reacts, did they like it, did they not like it, um --
R:  Okay. [NOISE]
L:  -- things like that. 
R:  Hm.
L:  And, um, it's -- it's fun and you [LAUGH] -- you --
R:  And you get to --
L:  -- get to go with people, too.  It's -- it's a good way to -- I hate to say this -- to treat my friends to the movies.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Yeah, I can see how that would be -- that's pretty --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I mean, it's nice, though, that you can sort of take advantage of it and you're doing something valuable, so ...
L:  Yeah. 
R:  It's handy. 
L:  Yeah, I took my husband to the last one, Anger Management --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, you know, he's -- well, you don't know -- you don't know him, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he didn't wanna go.
R:  Oh.
L:  It's like, "Ah, I don't wanna go, why are you --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- dragging me into this?"  
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  And, um, so I took him and he's --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- there and he's watching the film and he's laughing all the way through it.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And I said that, "Aren't you glad you finally decided to come?"  He said, "Yeah".
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's a good thing.
L:  Mhm, yes, so, but ...
R:  Is he just not into the movies very much?
L:  Him or me?
R:  Is he -- he.
L:  H- him?
R:  Is he just not -- not -- yeah.
L:  Um, I don't think he's really in- into movies.  When you, um [inaudible] --
