L:  Hello.
R:  Hi. I'm Alison.
L:  Oh hi, I'm Janice. [LAUGH] 
R:  Hi, Janice! [LAUGH] 
L:  Where do you live?
R:  I live in Seattle, Washington.
L:  Oh, I'm in Bretson[?], Virginia.
R:  Oh wow! That's quite a ways away.
L:  Yeah, opposite ends of the country. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]
R:  So, how about movies?
L:  Uh, the last movie I saw was My Big Fat Greek Wedding.
R:  [MN] I haven't seen that one.
L:  Oh, it was wonderful, I really liked it.  A friend of mine -- 
R:  I --
L:  -- took me.
R:  Nice.  I've heard that it's really good.  Um, did you see it in a theater or did you rent it?
L:  [MN] In a theater.
R:  In a theater, yeah, you didn't rent.
L:  But it -- it -- I -- it wasn't a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- first run by the time we saw it, so it was ...
R:  Uh-huh. [PAUSE]  Yeah, the last movie that I saw was probably the X. Men Two movie.
L:  Oh!
R:  [LAUGH] Have you heard of that?
L:  Was it good?
R:  It was -- it was really good.  My -- my boyfriend kind of dragged me to it but I really enjoyed it.
L:  Oh!
R:  Um, I had never read the comic books or anything, so I guess there's this whole [NOISE] story behind it that I don't even know about, but it was a good movie.
L:  [MN] Oh, I think my son likes the X. Men.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I liked seeing it in a theatre though because on the bigger screen it just does have more impact.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  Um  [MN]
L:  I don't rent movies. [LAUGH] 
R:  Really, not at all?
L:  No, not -- [PAUSE] hardly ever. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.  I don't rent them so much.  We have -- we own a lot of movies.
L:  Oh!
R:  So   Sometimes we watch those but -- well yeah we don't watch movies very much,  Can you hold on a second?
L:  Sure.
R:  Hey, I'm on the phone doing that survey thing, the -- uh, the [inaudible] thing, um, it'll be a minute.  Sorry. [MN] 
L:  Oh, that's okay. [LAUGH] 
R:  Um.
L:  So how did you hear about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- this project.
R:  Um, I have a friend who has a friend who works at the [MN] place where they're doing the study.
L:  Oh!  University of Pennsylvania?
R:  Yeah, that's right.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.  She's a linguist there, so I kind of heard through them. [MN]
L:  Oh, 'cause --
R:  Yeah, how --
L:  -- I read about it on a website.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Do you -- do you have the internet in your house?
L:  Oh yeah, I'm on it right now.
R:  Oh that's great.
L:  I'm filling out a survey. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, we don't have -- we don't have an internet set up in our house so I have to go to the library or do it at work.
L:  Oh!
R:  Which means I don't really use it that much.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I live on it. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Lots of people do.  I definitely did when I was in college -- because I had it right there in my dorm room all the time.
L:  Mhm. [PAUSE] 
R:  So. [PAUSE] Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean I don't watch television.  I'm on the internet all the time.
R:  Yeah. [PAUSE]  Yeah.  Do you have a TV?
L:  Uh, yes.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Just that I just --
R:  Just don't watch -- watch it much?
L:  [MN] When [MN], uh -- September eleventh I -- I sat glued to the television --
R:  Oh, yeah!
L:  -- but, uh, yeah, other than that I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or if there's some big snow storm here --
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  -- where everything's closed and I watch to see -- because they put, you know, the reporters all out all over the place --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they film the snow coming down on them, but, ah 
R:  Do you get a lot of snow where you live?
L:  Um, [MN] on occasion.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  I -- well, the thing is when we get snow here then everything closes.
R:  Oh yeah.  It's similar to that [NOISE] where I grew up -- I grew up in Portland. [NOISE]
L:  Oh!
R:  And if there was like an inch of snow on the ground, you know, school would be called for the day.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and it would be gone by the afternoon, but 
L:  Oh yeah, they used up all their snow days early this year --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- so they've lengthened school days -- I don't know -- by forty five minutes, I guess --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- starting last month until the end of school year or something.
R:  Wow.
L:  But they don't really --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's not like they make up the thing, you know, the extra minutes don't do much 'cause --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  When my kids were still in school, [MN] uh, they did that one year and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's -- it was just waste -- it was a waste.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah I hear they having to do that -- they're having to extend the school year actually because there was a huge teacher strike at the beginning of the year --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- and so it delayed the opening of the --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- school for -- I think weeks possibly in some part of the state -- it was crazy.
L:  Hm. [PAUSE]  No we haven't had a strike here.
R:  That's good.  Hopefully you pay your teachers better there than we do here.
L:  Huh.
R:  Although I don't know.
L:  I don't know. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know if anybody does these days. [NOISE] [PAUSE]
L:  But, ah   What was the last movie you before the X. Men?
R:  Before the X. Men, let me see, um, [SIGH] I don't remember -- I think it was quite a while ago.
L:  Oh!
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I don't go very often -- I think the one before that was uh, Chocolat, because --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- I read the book.
R:  That was a really cute movie.
L:  It was -- but y- -- they changed things.
R:  Oh really?  No, I never read the book.
L:  Oh, yeah. I read --
R:  [NOISE] What was different in the movie?
L:  Um, let's see   Who was it that broke into the candy store --
R:  Mm -- um,
L:  -- was it the priest?
R:  Yeah -- not the priest but he was like a businessman guy, wasn't he?
L:  Okay.  I think there was a priest in the book.
R:  Okay.
L:  I mean they just changed things.
R:  Yeah, that's strange.
L:  But, uh, all her books are -- I've -- I've read all the books by that author, and ah 
R:  Oh, really!
L:  It's Joanne Harris and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- she wrote something about oranges and I forget what the other two were, but...
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, they're good books.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And before that I think I saw Forest Gump, so it's big gaps. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't go much.
R:  Yeah.  I guess I go to the movies a little more than that, um  [MN] although I recently got out of college and, you know, while I was in college I didn't have [LAUGH] enough money to go the movies --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ever, so, um   It's gotten really expensive though.  I remember when I was younger like a matinee was three dollars and a quarter.
L:  Oh --
R:  You know.
L:  -- I remember when movies --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- were thirty five cents! [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] This is back in the fifties though. [LAUGH] 
R:  Wow!  [NOISE] That seems unbelievable now, doesn't it?  I mean just it's --
L:  Yeah, and it should be --
R:  -- so expensive!
L:  -- adult's fares and children's f- fares --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [MN] you know, and they were tickets and they were different -- you know, children were less.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't know if they still do that.
R:  I think they do.
L:  Oh.
R:  I think [NOISE] -- I think it's like maybe under fourteen or something --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that costs less.
L:  And then they charge so much for the refreshments.
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  I would never buy anything there.
R:  No.  I generally like buy something before I come and like stick it in my backpack or something, you know.
L:  Yeah. Well I've read that's where they really make their money.
R:  Yeah, on the --
L:  On the refreshments, not on --
R:  -- [NOISE] mhm.
L:  -- the movie tickets.
R:  Which is surprising considering [LAUGH] that they're so expensive. Mm.
L:  Well, I guess, you know, th- -- they make all these multi theaters so they only have that many people --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that can see one movie at a time, because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they wanna have twenty screens or --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- whatever it is. [PAUSE] 
R:  It just seems like a lot. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Twenty screens in a theater.
L:  Well I -- they might show the same movie at several of them --
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  -- depending on how big the movie is --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but, ah 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So then, I don't know --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, how many can they have?  Like a hundred people at the most in one of them.
R:  I don't know -- I don't know how big movie theaters are.
L:  Yeah -- it -- ar- -- around here I think they're all --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- multi screen ones.
R:  Yeah. [PAUSE] [SIGH] The town that I lived in -- I lived in Massachusetts last year -- and there was one of the smallest movie [NOISE] theaters I've ever been in -- I mean, it had like, [SIGH] three seats on each side so like there were six seats across and maybe [NOISE] ten rows and that was it, I mean really small.
L:  That was the whole thing?
R:  That was the whole thing.
L:  Wow!
R:  But it had two -- two screens and both of them were really -- really small like that.
L:  Oh!
R:  It was strange.  Um, I don't like going to movies in theaters that are that small.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know why -- it like seems to defeat the purpose of the whole big screen [NOISE] thing. [PAUSE] So are you planning on seeing any movies? This summer?
L:  Um  no! [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I -- you know -- I just never --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- even -- I don't even pay attention to movies.
R:  Uh-huh -- uh-huh. [PAUSE] Have you heard of the new movie that -- it recently [NOISE] came out -- probably not if you don't pay attention to the movies but it's called Bend It Like Beckham.  Have you heard of it at all?
L:  Uh  who's in it?
R:  [SIGH] Nobody famous, it's about a little girl in England who plays soccer.  She wants to be a professional soccer player.
L:  Oh!
R:  Um, and she's -- her family's from India originally and they all frown on her playing soccer and, um, it's supposed to be just a fabulous movie and everybody I've --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- talked to says -- 
L:  It sounds good!
R:  -- that it's just great.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I have yet to see it but I'd like too.
L:  I like oddball movies -- I remember seeing Babette's Feast years and years ago --
R:  Oh, yeah, I've see that.
L:  -- and that was good.  I like things --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- related to food. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Did you see Like Water For Chocolate?
L:  No.
R:  That's a very food movie -- it -- it's in Spanish but it has subtitles.
L:  [MN] 
R:  But it's all about these beautiful meals that this woman makes --
L:  Oh!
R:  Um, [MN] but that also came from a book, and it did real good justice to the book I thought.
L:  Oh, I -- I didn't read the book either.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  It was supposed to be good though.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I can't read everything.
R:  I know.  There's so many things that I'd like to read and I just don't have enough time.  I -- I suppose that, you know, I could make the time but, it just never seems like it.
L:  So what do you do for a living?
R:  [MN] Um, I work in one of the [NOISE] health clinic.
L:  Oh!
R:  Yeah. Um, I'm not a nurse or anything but I am an assistant -- like I -- I'm a Healthcare Assistant is what my title is.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I assist the doctor and the nurse that work there.
L:  Oh!
R:  It's a lot of fun, you meet a lot of people.  Um  [NOISE]
L:  Is that like a physician's assistant?
R:  Yeah, it's kind of like that.
L:  Oh, did you train for that?
R:  I trained -- I did a- ...
