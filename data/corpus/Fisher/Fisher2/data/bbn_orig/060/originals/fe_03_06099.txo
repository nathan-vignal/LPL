L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  My name's Catherine.
L:  Hi Catherine.  I'm Barbara.  Where are -- 
R:  I -- 
L:  -- you from?
R:  New York city.
L:  Oh, and how is the -- 
R:  And you?
L:  I'm in south Florida.
R:  Oh, lucky you, I think.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't know.  How's the weather in New York?
R:  Well, today the weather's absolutely beautiful.  I -- 
L:  Oh, good.
R:  -- mean it's bril- -- I love Florida.
L:  Oh, good.
R:  I'm down there whenever I can go but it's beautiful today.
L:  And I'm a New Yorker so -- 
R:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm from the Bronx originally.
R:  Oh, that's where my, ah, father was from.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But, I'm a city girl.
L:  Well, that's good -- 
R:  Anyway, so we are to talk ab- -- well, I'm a readaholic okay -- 
L:  You're a readaholic?
R:  Yes.
L:  Well, so am I.
R:  I read every newspaper practically.  Every day I read -- ah, I'm on my computer, um, regarding the news, ah, television and I also talk to people.  Ah, you know, back and forth comments.
L:  Well, the funniest thing is 'cause many times when I go on the internet if, you know, when you sign on the first thing they do is give you the headlines and you know, the news in brief.  So, if I haven't heard anything I get it immediately just from turning on my computer.
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  It's incredible.  I mean, you know, somebody sneezes in Europe and we can say, "God bless you" at the -- 
R:  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  -- same time.  The world has gotten smaller and smaller.
R:  It has and, um, well I'm proud of my age.  Every wrinkle I deserve.  But, I'm fifty five.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And I, um, have a daughter who's twenty six who lives in California.  She's going for her PhD and I have two masters and I never knew how to use the computer.  We didn't have computers then.
L:  Of course not.
R:  I don't know your age.  But, they didn't have cell phones, they didn't have beepers.  So -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- on my fiftieth birthday my daughter said, "You know what mom?  You can't be afraid anymore".  I said, "I don't care about them".  Well, she bought me a computer.  [LAUGH] And -- 
L:  Well, you know, they're nice to have especially if she lives in California.  You can even instant email her an -- 
R:  It's great -- 
L:  -- instant message.
R:  -- because it's three hours difference.
L:  That's right.  So, you can leave her a message at, ah, you know, your time and she can answer you in the morning or at her convenience and you save -- 
R:  Oh, we're -- we're -- 
L:  -- a lot of -- 
R:  -- she's my -- she's my baby.  She's my only one so we're constantly on the cell phone, you know -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that kind of thing.  But, yeah, we, um, we'd [several inaudible words] -- her friends from other parts of the country and, um, and I really love -- I get information -- 
L:  That's right.
R:  -- you know?  Um, I have something wrong with my eye.  I've an allergy in my eye and the doctor told me what it was.  So, I got on the internet to find out what it was -- 
L:  That's right.
R:  -- to make sure -- 
L:  Absolutely.
R:  -- the medication -- 'cause I don't trust doctors [LAUGH] that much.
L:  I agree with you.
R:  And, um, so everything's on the internet.  But, not everybody has the access to a computer -- 
L:  Absolutely not but I find that I also have tendency now -- now to watch CNN because if I'm in and out of the house, ah, I can flick it on and find out what's going on.  You know, ah --  
R:  In just a minute.
L:  -- my husband says -- my husband says I get the watered down version.  He says I -- I like the, ah, CNN, um, [MN] not the regular -- what -- headline news.  He says I on- -- I only go for the headline news.
R:  Is that like, ah, channel one in New York?
L:  Well, I don't -- 
R:  In -- 
L:  -- know what it is in New York but down here we have CNN and I think it's called headline news.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And many times if I don't have the time to -- or the patience for CNN I'll listen to the headline news.  It at least tells me what's going on.
R:  Right.  So, you can -- 
L:  And then I can -- 
R:  -- go out in the day and be able [LAUGH] to be -- 
L:  And then I can go if I want to, you know, through the channels.  The newspapers I find are -- are too slow now because by the time the newspaper prints it it's old news already.
R:  I agree and since I have this, ah, eye allergy which -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'm now taking drops and everything even though my eyes are twenty, twenty, ah, if I read too -- for too long a time -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- my eyes get all red and itchy but if I put on the television or I'm on the computer, it's not as bad.
L:  Well, the television you could even just close your eyes and listen basically.
R:  Yeah, actually -- 
L:  And so -- right but I find that now -- I used to depend  a lot on the newspapers and the newspapers are -- it -- it's -- by the time I get it in the morning the news is old news.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I can't -- I've -- you know, I've listened to it between the television and the, ah -- 
R:  The computer.
L:  -- computer.  Right -- 
R:  Yeah.  It's [several inaudible words] -- 
L:  I've heard it when it happened so by the time the -- you know, the newspaper takes time for them to print and everything else it's -- it's -- oh, I look at it and I say, "Oh, okay" but I can see more pictures or sometimes it might go into more detail.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, ah -- 
R:  Well -- 
L:  -- I still like the -- you know, the newspaper.  I'm a newspaper reader.
R:  Yeah, I'm -- I'm a reader of everything.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  You know, but, ah -- well, not fiction.  Non -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- fiction mostly.
L:  You like [inaudible] -- 
R:  But, um, right now, you know, my eyes get blurry so I've been depending on the computer and I got a screen that's -- that's not as blurry and I have a couple of more weeks the doctor says.  My -- 
L:  Well, that would be good -- 
R:  -- opthamologist.
L:  -- then you can go back to re- -- to reading and everything.
R:  Yeah, but I still miss this.  I have delivered on the weekends to my door.  I have the Times delivered.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Only on the weekends, ah, because then I don't have to run out in the winter, [LAUGH] you know -- 
L:  Right, well, that takes -- 
R:  -- I'm lazy.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  -- you a whole week to read anyhow.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  But, by the time you've finished it that's [inaudible] the -- the newspaper, that's obsolete anyhow the news.  It's old news.
R:  I wonder if the newspapers are going to be a good buy.  They're raising the prices but, ah -- 
L:  Are they really?
R:  Yeah.   The New York Times during the week went up twenty five cents.  Everything's going up in New York.
L:  Everything is going -- yes, everything is going up all over because of the fact that nobody has money anymore and the advertisers aren't, ah, as, you know, doing as much as they used to.
R:  Well, I notice what's advertised on television is all about, like, Mark Shopping Dome and, ah, you know, all about, ah, different medications that are -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- out and, um, I usually bleep -- I shut off the, ah, sound when the, you know, commercials come on.
L:  Yeah, well, sure -- 
R:  [LAUGH] Well -- 
L:  They can drive you to drink those commercials. 
R:  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  There's more commercials I think sometimes than there are programs.
R:  Where do you live in Florida, exactly?
L:  In Fort Lauderdale.
R:  Oh, okay.  My parents had a home in Boca[?].
L:  Mhm, true, that's in Florida -- 
R:  And, ah, but I was going to Kasumi[?], that area.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I have a friend who lives in, um, [MN] Florida and what's that, ah, right near Miami.
L:  Oh, [several inaudible words].
R:  Yeah, I -- I have friends down there but now that my daughter's in California I head in that direction.
L:  But, now you go to California.
R:  Yeah, I'm not crazy about it.  I still love Florida.
L:  Is she your only daughter?
R:  Yeah, she's my baby.  My twenty six year old baby.
L:  Oh, we all have babies.
R:  Yeah.  How old are your -- you have, ah -- 
L:  I have -- my two -- my -- my -- well, my oldest son is forty four and my youngest son is going to be thirty nine this year.
R:  Ah.  Okay -- 
L:  So, they're -- they're my -- those are my babies.
R:  And I do have this son that -- he's not my natural son but I, um, adopted him.  It was my fourth ch- -- son.
L:  Oh.
R:  And, um, so he's in the navy.
L:  So, you have three sons?
R:  No.  One son.
L:  Oh, one son -- 
R:  One son -- 
L:  And one daughter. 
R:  -- and a natural daughter.
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  My son, ah, his parents, ah, passed away so I -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- adopted him.   But, ah, now they've grown out of the house and I'm ready for retirement [several inaudible words] I don't know where I want to go.
L:  Yeah, well, that's a problem, yeah.  Do you have a husband?
R:  Um, unfortunate- -- well, I did have a [LAUGH] couple.
L:  Yeah, well -- 
R:  But, the man I was with for the last seven years passed away this last June, seventeenth, with inoperable lung cancer.
L:  Oh.
R:  At fifty seven we'd started looking for houses in Florida and you know, retirement.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And he was in the hospital eight weeks and boom, that was it.
L:  Well, the only suggestion -- 
R:  So, I'm starting -- 
L:  -- that -- 
R:  -- over in middle age.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, it's never too late to start.  The only thing that you might not want to settle in California because if your daughter, you know, changes or moves or things like that -- 
R:  Well, the thing is, you know, she's a city girl and she does not want to come back to New York.  She really loves it out there.  But, then again, what if she does move, you know -- 
L:  That's right -- 
R:  -- so -- 
L:  -- and, ah, lots of people I know have moved because of their children and then their children move and then -- then they say, "Well --"  
R:  Well, that's why I'm not doing -- 
L:  "-- what am I doing here?"
R:  -- anything for a couple of years.  I have a fabulous apartment on the upper west side and -- 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- seven rooms facing the river, and in New York.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And right near the park.  So, for two years -- and then she'll be graduating half her [several inaudible words] and then she can decide.  Until -- 
L:  And the -- 
R:  -- then I'm not giving this up.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Absolute- -- I wouldn't either.  But -- 
R:  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  -- ah, you can get a lot of the news just looking out your window I'm sure.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  That's true.  [LAUGH] Oh, boy, well, you know?
L:  Just seeing what's going on in New York, you go and look out your +window and there's a whole -- 
R:  But, you know, I tend not to go into places anymore -- the crowds.  I've had it.  You know, I'm a third generation New Yorker -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And we're getting off the subject.  It doesn't really matter though. [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Well, we'll go back to the subject because that's, ah, basically how we get our news.  And -- and we also get our news from our friends.  Many times don't you go some place or I might pick up my girlfriend and she'll say to me, "Oh, my God, did you hear what happened" and I'll -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  -- say, "No, I didn't hear because I was driving or I don't -- I don't put the television on in the morning.  I listen to it mostly in the afternoon or the evening" I said.  And I don't, ah, I didn't know what happened.  So, many times I'll get the news from my friends.
R:  Well, I remember nine eleven and, um, my girlfriend called me.  I was sleeping.  I'm not an early morning person.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And she called me and said, "Did you hear?"  I said -- 
L:  That -- 
R:  -- "Hear --"  
L:  -- that's right.
R:  -- what?"  You know, and I -- I -- I --" 
L:  That's right.
R:  -- heard a lot of helicopters and a lot of stuff going on -- 
L:  Abs- -- 
R:  -- outside but I didn't know.  What do I care [LAUGH] -- 
L:  I think -- 
R:  -- you know?
L:  -- I basically get the news from many, many different sources that the -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- internet, from the television.  As I said, the newspaper I get it too.  But, by the time I do get the newspaper it's old news and many times even from my friends, you know, "Well, did you hear" such and such or, "No, I didn't".  Ah, it might not have been of interest to me but it was still news worthy and -- 
R:  Right, I would say the -- 
L:  -- you know, they'll go and tell you -- 
R:  -- computer is the best place because they're constantly updating.
L:  Absolutely.  It's -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- amazing because, as I say, I think as the event is happening the computer already has it.
R:  Right.
L:  And many times my husband will say to me he missed the sports -- ah, he didn't see what the sports, ah, you know, the scores are or something.  He'll say to me, "Go on to the computer at night" he says, "'Cause you can find it before I can get it in the morning's newspaper".
R:  But, he does use the computer, right? 
L:  Well, he does use it -- 
R:  Oh, uh-huh -- 
L:  -- but many times if I go -- he'll go to bed earlier than I do so I'll go on the internet.  I'll say to him, "Well, I'll" -- and, "Find out what the scores are for me".  So, the internet is a constant source of -- of -- 
R:  Oh, it's wonderful -- 
L:  -- information and it's news.
R:  -- I could be on it for hours for everything.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, you can really, ah, you know, use it for anything that you want.  Any -- 
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- kind of news and, ah, [inaudible] and if you go sometimes into depth, you know, you can really, ah, get a good picture from what's happening as well.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm -- 
L:  It's amazing -- 
R:  -- still -- 
L:  -- how the world is changing or -- 
R:  It's scary.
L:  -- who ever knew it -- absolutely.  Whoever knew from computers and everything?  I didn't grow up -- 
R:  I mean, when my -- 
L:  -- with computers.
R:  -- kids were growing up it's like there were no --
