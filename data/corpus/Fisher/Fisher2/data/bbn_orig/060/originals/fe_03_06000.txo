R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Ann Marie.
R:  Hi, I'm Rebecca.
L:  Hi Rebecca.
R:  How are you?
L:  I'm fine.  How 'bout you?
R:  I'm okay.
L:  Good.  Uh, what do you think?
R:  Oh, I'm not sure.  I -- I think I have mixed emotions on it.
L:  I have a lot of mixed emotions about it too.
R:  You know, I think everything depends on each individual, you know. 
L:  I do too.  And I -- 
R:  -- circumstance.
L:  -- they always say the hypothetical if you have two candidates who are exactly the same, then do you pick the one that's the minority or the women?  And you want to say yes, but at the same time, very rarely would you run into that -- that hypothetical.  There's always going to be something that's going to make a candidate better than another.
R:  I agree.
L:  So ...
R:  I agree.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [COUGH] But anyway, that -- that's my feeling on it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I completely agree.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] very --
L:  Do you work out- -- do you work outside your home?
R:  No, I don't.  I'm a homemaker.
L:  Okay.  I also am a homemaker, but I did work for years and I -- [NOISE] I never felt -- I guess I was never in a place where I felt like [NOISE] everything was, you know, ruled by white males.  So ...
R:  And, see I was a bar tender.
L:  Mm.  Mm.
R:  So, they hi- -- most places want to hire women over men.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- and that and, you know, it just --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's a weird category.  [LAUGH] 
R:  It is.
L:  It's a weird subject.  It's a hard one.
R:  Yeah.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know, my mom is actually a manager of a law firm.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, she, you know, just goes basically on --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- peoples credentials --
L:  That's all you can do.
R:  Right.
L:  That's all you can do.  And I guess maybe it's tougher in these times when companies can't hire as many people [NOISE] and -- 
R:  Right. 
L:  -- and you do run into still a lot of the old companies I -- I worked for an oil company for a while and talk about, you know, white male rule and --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- in a place like that.  But even then it seems like at this point, [NOISE] the people at the top are trying to diversify.  And they -- even this oil company was holding diversification classes and they would talk to people about being really sensitive to it.
R:  Right.
L:  You know and there is -- there are so many law suits out there that I -- I think they really try to do that; even the big old companies.
R:  I know.  It's -- it's sorta, like, no matter what they do, they're going to get these law suits though.
L:  Right.  Exactly. 
R:  You know people -- certain people have sorta ruined --
L:  Exactly.  And I think a lot of those lawsuits come from people who probably needed to be fired.  And -- and --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- they played the race or the --
R:  Excuse me.
L:  -- gender card.
R:  I agree.
L:  And -- and [NOISE] they shouldn't.  But --
R:  But my mom is -- is ro- -- really not making what other office managers who are male would --
L:  Right.
R:  -- be making.
L:  [NOISE] I agree.
R:  She's still kinda below -- 
L:  Right.  
R:  -- average.
L:  And I guess -- I never thought [NOISE] of that, but th- -- I guess the guys at the top can hire at a cheaper rate and diversify at the same time.
R:  Right.
L:  They can say we're diverse; we have, you know, women, we have minorities working for us, but they're not paying as much as they would have had to if they hired a white guy maybe.  [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But anyway ... [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
R:   [LAUGH] 
L:  My husband's home so, it's, like, oh good --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you can listen to --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- the screaming for a bit.
R:  So, have you been doing these calls for a long time?  Or ...
L:  You know what, [NOISE] um, last week was the first ones.
R:  Me too.
L:  But I've done maybe two or three.
R:  This is my second one.
L:  Oh.
R:  Where did you find out about it?
L:  [NOISE] Um, one of my friend's onli- -- I'm on an online list and she --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- let me know about it.
R:  Cool.
L:  So, how did you find out?
R:  I -- mon- -- sweepstakes groups online.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.  Oh right, which one are you on?
R:  Um, winners are us.
L:  Oh.  Okay.  Oh, I'm not --
R:  It's at Yahoo.
L:  -- on that one.  I'm on -- do -- I know you must know [several inaudible words] 
R:  Yes.
L:  It's a [LAUGH] [inaudible] --
R:  Well, I don't know her, but, uh --
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE] 
R:  I get her emails.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  I'm on -- I'm on her list in more than just sweeps.  And one of the other women on that list [NOISE] posted it.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  So, yeah.  Oh, how funny.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  We're probably entering the same things all the time.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I try.  [LAUGH]
L:  I know, me too.  Me too.  But with two kids it gets hard sometimes.  [NOISE] 
R:  I have an eight year old.
L:  Oh, do you?
R:  And now I'm babysitting for my nephew who's eight weeks.
L:  Oh.  Oh, what a difference.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  I know.  Oh, [NOISE] I sorta sometimes can't wait until mine are --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- off and [LAUGH] in school.  I [inaudible] --
R:  We've been trying for a year, we want one more and now it's like, I've had this baby and it's, like, oh my -- oh, my God, I don't know if I can do it again.
L:  I know.  I know.  It changes your life so much.  And I forgot -- oh, I -- I have a three year old and them my, well, she'll be four in September.  And then my son just turned one a couple of weeks ago.
R:  Ooh.
L:  So, they keep me on my toes, you know, she's --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- older now and she's off to preschool and -- and she's doing great.  And she acts grown up, but in a lot of ways, I mean, she's still three.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  You know, so that three year old -- 
R:  Right.  
L:  -- and a one year old, oh --
R:  It goes so fast though.
L:  I know.  And even she grew so fast and that's why we had him 'cause I --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- forgot -- [LAUGH] is what I keep saying.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] [inaudible] 
L:  So, but even then, he's getting so big, [NOISE] so fast that pretty soon --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it'll be over with so there's no way we'll go for a third.  And --
R:  I know, time flies.
L:  Every once in a while I'm, like, oh, but I'm, like, no.  It's too close, I --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I remember.  There's no way.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So -- anyways.
R:  Well --
L:  Boy, what a horrible topic.  I've nothing --
R:  I know.
L:  -- else left -- where was y- -- 
R:  I don't --
L:  -- what was the other topic that you had before?
R:  On pets.
L:  On what?
R:  Pets.
L:  Oh, pets.
R:  And it was just a general talk about pets.  And the person I had didn't have any.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's hard.
R:  Well, I have enough so ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, I think my -- the first one was, um, [NOISE] that I had I -- I've done two I guess 'cause one of 'em was sports.  It's like sports and it's two women and we're both talking about --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know, our husbands.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, that was interesting.  And then [NOISE] I forget what the other one -- oh, when is, um, when does humor go too far.
R:  Ah.
L:  You know, that kind of thing.  So -- anyway ...
R:  Affirmative action [LIPSMACK] 
L:  Hm?
R:  So, I don't know -- really know what else to say about it.
L:  I know, me neither.  Me neither.  Affirmative action --
R:  I'm looking on Yahoo about it right now; there's --
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  -- all kinds --
L:  You know --
R:  -- of groups.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- actually, you know what?  Do you think it should be mandated?  It's something that always comes up in the legislature --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, and -- and do you make affirmative action a -- a legal thing?  And I always said, no because it's already covered I feel like --
R:  I think we kinda have too many laws already.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  Think it's something you can't -- I think it's something that just has to --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- become the culture of a company.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, not -- not -- we don't do it because it's the law, we do it because it's right.  You know, so ...
R:  Yeah, but --
L:  And I guess too many --
R:  -- companies usually don't.  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  Too many --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- companies will avoid that and -- [NOISE] and not care.  But I like to think that everybody working for a company is still a person so ...
R:  Right.  [NOISE] 
L:  Anyways ...
R:  I don't know honey.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Dad's at work.  Dad works nights [inaudible] 
L:  Oh.  Actually, yeah, mine just came home and is making pizza tonight.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, you know what --
R:  All right.
L:  -- I must have the weirdest three year old in the world 'cause she hates pizza.
R:  That's strange.
L:  And so -- and so she's, like, I want scrambled eggs.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Ooh.
L:  So, he's in there making scrambled eggs for --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- her [LAUGH] or something, yeah, on top of making pizza for us.  So, we figure we'd send her upstairs to watch Cinderella too.  You know, it's her bedtime.  We put her to bed in our room.  [NOISE] Let her watch that --
R:  So --
L:  -- until she falls asleep.
R:  Have you talked to anybody that's gotten paid for this?
L:  You know what, not yet.  No.
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  Aren't you supposed to do, like, [NOISE] a certain number of them and then you do?
R:  I -- I really don't remember.
L:  Or do you get paid to begi- -- I don't either.  I just looked at --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- it and said, "Oh, yeah, I could do that."
R:  Yes.
L:  There's money.
R:  All the serve- --
L:  So ...
R:  -- I tried to find out for her.
L:  Mhm.  I do too.  And did you -- do you do, um, like, Greenfield online?
R:  Oh, yeah.  That's -- that's -- been pretty good to me.
L:  And do you do Pine Cone?
R:  Huh?
L:  Do y- -- have you heard of Pine Cone Research?
R:  Yeah.  I do Pine Cone --
L:  Do -- I do that one too.
R:  -- um, do you ever go to, like, um wh- -- I think it's called Big Dig forums?
L:  Which one?
R:  -- Big, Big forums or something like that.
L:  No.  No.  I've never heard of them.
R:  It's a really good, um, forum.  And they --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- have, like, a list of, like, you know, fifty different survey companies --
L:  Oh, I'll need to check that out.  Big Big forums dot com?
R:  Let me got to it real quick and tell you the name of it.  I've got it here in my favorites.  It's called Big Big Forums.  Yeah.
L:  Oh, neat.  Dot com, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  Big Big Savings -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that's the name of it.  And then they have forums there.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.  And my name's Asriell[?] on there.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  All right.  I always go by AM Weeks in everything.
R:  Cool.  Maybe I'll see ya.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  That would be fun.  Oh, I'm going to have to check that one out.
R:  Yeah.  It's -- it's pretty good.  That's where I heard a lot about a lot of the surveys.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  It's like a points program board, but really no one does the points programs --
L:  Right.
R:  -- much.
L:  No.
R:  So, it's all surveys.
L:  Okay.  Do you do any of those?  [NOISE] I still do, um, what is it?  My -- [MN] not my --
R:  My points?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Occasionally.  And if I am going to buy something I'll go through there.
L:  Right.
R:  But, uh, I love doing, like, net slip and, like, all these point --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- clicking ones.  And --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- they all started going up and --
L:  Yeah they did.  And there -- y- -- it seemed like I was taking so much time and not --
R:  Right.
L:  -- really getting anything for it.
R:  Right.  And then as soon as I got, like, cable modem, they all quit.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.
R:  I was, like, darn it.  [MN] 
L:  I know, that's the one thing I don't have that I really, really want.
R:  Oh, it makes such a difference.
L:  I know.  I know.
R:  But about four years ago, I did really good -- remember beans or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- something like that?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
L:  I do remember that.
R:  We had a good Christmas that year 
L:  It's so funny to talk to somebody who does all that 'cause --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I really --
R:  I know -- and I've tried to --
L:  -- you know, all my friends are like, "You -- how do you know this stuff?"  You know --
R:  I know and I try to get my friends into it and they just, I don't know.
L:  They're, like, yeah, right.
R:  They don't do it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, do you do eBay stuff too?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I -- I 
L:  Do you sell?
R:  -- I shop way more than I sell though.
L:  Oh, you're going to have to check me out; AM Weeks.  But --  
R:  Okay, I will.
L:  -- actually my computer had gone down and we just got a new one [NOISE] so, and my digital camera wasn't compatible with it so, I ordered a --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- new digital camera.  And so hopefully, by --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- next week, I can start listing again.
R:  Cool.
L:  But a lot of what I've been doing though is baby clothes.  But then I've been recently going out to garage sales and finding some good stuff.
R:  See, that's what I want to do 'cause --
L:  -- and then turn it around.
R:  I [inaudible] my daughter's clothes --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like, [several inaudible words] lot of, like, her size six that she grew out of. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then I sold one of my husband's --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- guitars a few weeks ago
L:  Oh, neat.  And a lot --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of -- a lot of times, um, what was I going to say?  Oh, a lot of times the things that I win in sweepstakes --
