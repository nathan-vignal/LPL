L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, I'm Kristin.
L:  Hi, I'm Tania.
R:  Hey.  Hi, Tania.
L:  I'm in California.
R:  Okay, I'm in Chicago.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LAUGH] How are you?
L:  I'm fine.
R:  Well, [MN] movies, huh.  This is the first one I've done.
L:  Oh, is it?  This is like my fourth one.
R:  Oh, good, okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You start then.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, great.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, let's see they said do you -- would you rather watch movies at home or go to the movies?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Well, let's see for that question, um, it kinda depends on my budget [LAUGH].
R:  I agree, I agree.
L:  Um, if I have money, then I like to go out to the movies and, like, if there's something really good I wanna see that's just come out --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- then I'd rather go see it but like today, I rented movies because --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- um, I'm just kinda low on money right now.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I went and got, like, four movies for, like, eleven bucks.
R:  Oh, you did good.
L:  You know, from the video store.  From --
R:  Okay.
L:  We have a Hollywood video out here.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, you know, it kinda usually all just depends on my budget basically.
R:  That makes sense.
L:  Um --
R:  Well, it depends with me with sitters.  Um, I have a little one so --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- it seems like we don't get out anymore -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- so we went a -- a few of 'em but I sure like to get out --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to see movies. Um, God, I don't even know what the last movie we saw was.  Um --
L:  Was it this year [LAUGH]?
R:  Yeah.  Isn't that scary? 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It was.  Um, God, I don't even know what the last one was.  What did you see last?
L:  Um, let's see I saw Daddy Daycare.
R:  Oh, I haven't seen that yet.
L:  Yeah, I have a nine year old daughter.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, so she was, like,  "Oh I want to go"  First she wanted to see Lizzie McGuire and then I said, "Well, I want to see Daddy Daycare" so we flipped for it.
R:  Okay.
L:  And I won [LAUGH].
R:  Okay.
L:  So, we saw Daddy Daycare and it was really good and, you know, there's just certain movies --
R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  -- I do like to go out --
R:  I'm like I had to think about that.  I saw Two Weeks Notice.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And that was good.
L:  Yeah, that was a while ago.
R:  I saw that.
L:  That was like four months ago or something [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, well that was about the last time I got out [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, how old is your little kid?
R:  He's four.
L:  Oh, four.  Okay.
R:  And you may hear him soon.  He was out playing baseball.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But now he's back in [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  So, uh, yeah, I saw that and Made to Order which was good.
L:  Oh, he would love Daddy Daycare.
R:  I -- you know --
L:  It's really funny and it's -- it's geared towards kids totally.
R:  Is it more?
L:  Oh, totally.  Yeah, it's totally geared for kids.
R:  Huh.  Well, I -- I've seen the previews and stuff so we're gonna kick back and watch some TV tonight but I don't think we have any movies down there.
L:  Right.
R:  So, and then what -- do we just keep talking about movies?
L:  Right, you just keep talking about movies and --
R:  [LAUGH] Well, tell me --
L:  You already --
R:  -- about Daddy Daycare.
L:  Um, well --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- Daddy Daycare is really good.  It's got, like, the absolutely most adorable little boy -- this is at the start of the movie.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  He is so adorable.  Like one of the cutest kids I've sever seen in my life.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, he really pretty much kinda carries the movie but then there's a lot of other little kids that are really cute little characters in it --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I saw this special actually on, uh something on a cable channel where they showed the making of the movie --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they were showing how the little kids are like really -- like they had to go through these little, uh, just little changes that they went through.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, like they would do something on the set and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- then they had to pull 'em aside and say, "Okay, now you can't do it like that" and [LAUGH] --
R:  Okay, [several inaudible words]
L:  You know, a couple of the kids were like the type that they had been in the movies, like, since they were two so they thought they knew everything.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, those kind of kids.
R:  Oh, well [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, and you can't really tell them anything because they're -- they're, like, Hollywood kids.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, like "I've been -- I've been doing commercials since I was eighteen months".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, that type.  So, it was really interesting but --
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, now [MN] we -- yeah, just Made to Order which was the last one -- we just rented Made to Order --
L:  Oh, okay.  What movie was that
R:  -- just this week.  That was the one with, um, oh, now what's the -- what's her name?  Um, Jennifer Lopez.
L:  Oh, you're saying --
R:  You know, she's the maid.
L:  -- Maid in Manhattan.
R:  Oh, that's what it's called.
L:  Yeah --
R:  Yes .
L:  -- when you said --
R:  Made to Order was the --
L:  -- Made to Order I'm like --
R:  -- old one.  That was that --
L:  -- what movie is that [LAUGH]?
R:  That was the one -- there is a made to Order but that's a real old one.
L:  Right.
R:  It's Maid in Manhattan.  That's it, sorry.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Now, I know what you're talking about.  The one with Jennifer Lopez, yeah.
R:  That's it, that's it.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  We just saw that one.  We rented --
L:  Was it good?
R:  Yeah, I liked it.  I liked it.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I like her.  She's pretty, you know [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, she is pretty.
R:  She is, so, uh --
L:  I just think she's just a little overblown though.
R:  I agree with that.
L:  You know, it's like we're -- we're inundated with Jennifer Lopez everywhere --
R:  I agree.
L:  -- we turn, everywhere, especially out here in California, you can imagine.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's like oh, God everything you see and hear about is Jennifer Lopez.
R:  Well --
L:  My -- my daughter's like J Lo'd out.
R:  Well, I think so.
L:  Everything she wants has to do with J Lo this and J Lo that and --
R:  Well, they were talking -- well, they're like -- my friends really -- well I don't know if Maid in Manhattan was better than Two Weeks Notice and I like Sandra Bullock.
L:  Right.
R:  I'm like she looks just really nice but like the girl next door type and I like her but I like -- and I like Hugh Grant so, yeah [LAUGH].
L:  Yes [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, so yeah that's about it for my movies [NOISE].
L:  Right.
R:  Hey, hon.  I'm on the phone [NOISE] [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, um, but yeah.  So, that's it, we just keep talking.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay, it's hard to talk when -- yeah.
L:  Yeah, you gotta talk about the same subject.
R:  Okay, keep talking about it.  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay, um, Matrix.  Are you a Matrix fan?
L:  Mhm.  Not totally, but I'm gonna see this one.
R:  I am going to too but the same deal.  I -- not a big fan but now I'm like, "Oh that ought to be ...".  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I figure, you now, if the movie's made close to a hundred million already in, like, three days --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it must be worth seeing [LAUGH].
R:  Exactly, exactly.
L:  So, I think I'll probably go see it tomorrow actually.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, I don't live far from Hollywood.  Like just like ten minutes away so ...
R:  Oh, well that's nice so --
L:  Yeah, so I'm gonna go up in Hollywood and see it like at the Chinese theater.  You know, the old [inaudible] Chinese --
R:  Really?
L:  It's like the -- yeah, it's a huge theater with a great sound system and you know that's the place to go to --
R:  Oh, how nice.
L:  That's when I like to see movies like out.  You know, like I would rather go see a movie out than see it at home --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when I can go to a theater like that and see it [NOISE]
R:  Well, that's exactly --
L:  Because you can't get that effect at home.  You just can't.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Unless you have one of those, you know, fifty six inch screens --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or something.  You know you can't really get that same effect so I would rather go and see movies out, you know --
R:  I'd rather go -- yeah, and I like the --
L:  Depending on the movie.
R:  -- old theaters.
L:  You know.
R:  But I like the old theaters.  
L:  Oh, right.  This one's like -- this is that classic, you know --
R:  right.
L:  -- old one.  I don't know if you've been -- have you ever been to California?
R:  No, well yes, San Francisco.  That's it.
L:  Oh, that's it.  Not LA.
R:  No.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But I decided I could live there.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, in San Francisco.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, well yeah [LAUGH].
L:  Wow, that's surprising.
R:  [LAUGH] I didn't want to go home.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  The people were really laid back and I liked that.
L:  Oh, yeah, everybody's laid back out here.  That's true.
R:  Yeah, so but -- yeah, we go to a little movie house around here.  It's a little old one that Saturdays they have an organ that comes up and plays before.
L:  Oh, really?  They have that in Hollywood out here too.
R:  Do they?
L:  At the El Capitan theater.  It does the same -- mostly for the kids movies.
R:  Okay, yeah.
L:  The guy comes up out of the ground playing the organ and all that.
R:  Yeah, that's kinda what ours is, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, you know --
L:  We got the same thing here.
R:  The sound isn't great but it's such a beautiful old theater that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's fun to -- yeah, yeah, watch it.  yeah.  I don't know [MN].  Oh, I know what we're gonna see.  Anger Management.
L:  Oh, that's a great movie.
R:  I can't wait to see that.
L:  Hilarious.
R:  That's what we're going to next week.  Have you seen it?
L:  Yeah, I've seen it.
R:  Okay, yeah.  Can't wait.
L:  Yeah, I saw it the first weekend it came out.
R:  See.  Yeah, we've been wanting to but we didn't --
L:  It kind -- it kinda gets a little crazy at the end.
R:  Does it?  yeah.
L:  Like it kinda really goes there in terms of reaching -- in terms of reality, you know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It kind really stretches the truth a bit but -- but it -- but it's funny.  Overall, it was funny though.
R:  Okay.  that's the only thing I'm like.  I hope it's not so built up that, you know, I'm really let down 'cause it --
L:  No, it's really good.
R:  -- looks so good.
L:  I mean, I -- you know, I wouldn't -- I wouldn't say it's like the best movie Adam --
R:  Right.
L:  -- Sandler ever did.  
R:  Yes.
L:  It's not the best movie that Jack Nicholson ever did but --
R:  Right, entertaining.
L:  If you like both of them --
R:  I do.
L:  -- you'll like the movie.
R:  Yeah, I do.
L:  If you're not really a Jack fan, you won't like it [LAUGH].
R:  Okay.  Yeah, I am so ...
L:  'Cause he's very typically Jack in that movie.
R:  It looked like it.  Some of the clips I was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like, "Oh this looks good".
L:  It's -- it's very much him [LAUGH].
R:  We decided we'd take our husbands, my girlfriend and I --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- because of it [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] That's funny.
R:  Yeah, so we're gonna go see that next week.  And, uh, yeah, so and that's it.  Well, I guess I knew a few movies around.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Not much but yeah.  So, we've got out here -- in fact I was just pulling up online, there's a lot of free movies for the kids which I didn't realize for the summer.  The movie houses out here do matinees.
L:  Oh.
R:  Like every week for the kids.
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  Yeah.  I thought so.  I mean, someone had told me about it and I thought, "Oh, really".  I don't -- you know, I'm just getting in that stage.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I downloaded all the movies for the summer and, uh, I thought, "Well that'd be something nice when it's warm out, you know, and ..."
L:  You mean it actually gets warm there.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It gets blasted hot here.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Nothing compares --
L:  I've never been back east before.
R:  Yeah, I know, I'm teasing.  It's probably -- our idea of hot here is probably totally different but yeah.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's hot, yeah [LAUGH].
L:  I can imagine.
R:  So ...
L:  I know like here in the winter when you say it's sixty five --
R:  That's perfect weather.
L:  -- to me that's cold. 
R:  Oh, and that's just perfect weather.
L:  That's perfect for there, right.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that's like today which is perfect.  Yeah, that's perfect weather [LAUGH].  So, anyways, well this is interesting.  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, it is.
R:  I'm like, "Oh, okay" [LAUGH] and then they just come on and tell you when to stop.
L:  Yeah, they're gonna come on probably in about a minute or so.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I think our ten minutes is almost up.
R:  Oh, is it?  Okay.
L:  They're gonna dis- disconnect us.
R:  [NOISE] And then they just disconnect [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  And then -- well, actually they're gonna say, you have thirty seconds to say goodbye to your talking partner [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.
