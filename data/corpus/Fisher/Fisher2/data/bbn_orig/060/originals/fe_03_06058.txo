L:  Hel- Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, this is Margaret.
R:  Hi, Margaret.  My name is Trish.
L:  Hi, Tr- oh, really? [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's interesting.  I got a couple of friends named Trish.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Okay, the movies, huh?
R:  Do you enjoy -- what did they say?  Do you enjoy going to the movies in the movie theater or would you rather rent them at home or something?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Um, let's see.  I don't mind going to movies every once in a while to a theater.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, because of the cost.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I agree with you there.
R:  Um, that's probably the only -- only reason I don't enjoy going.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But as a special night out, something different.
L:  Oh, I can't tell you the last time --
R:  Yeah, me either.
L:  -- I -- I can't -- I -- I think it's got to be four or five years --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- since I've been to the movies.  I mean, first of all we get satellite so they're always on --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you know, uh, eventually and I'd rather stay home and be comfortable on the couch [LAUGH].
R:  And it's a lot less expensive.
L:  That's right.  Light a few candles, make a bowl of popcorn and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know --
R:  And that's another thing that's too expensive at the movie theaters, is the food.
L:  Oh, everything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Everything and I just, uh -- I -- I -- I know that like it's a different experience going to a theater and, of course, you know you laugh more with people or you -- you know, just having the big screen TV and stuff.
R:  That's what I'm saying, yeah.  Um --
L:  But, um --
R:  -- something special or different.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I can't -- I can't remember the last movie I saw in the theater.
R:  [LAUGH] Or if there was a movie that I absolutely couldn't wait for it to come on.
L:  Yeah, but --
R:  But there hasn't been anything like that [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, what kind of movies do you like?
R:  Uh, comedies.
L:  Really? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, they -- yeah, they're uplifting.  They help -- help get you going.  I like -- every once in a while I like a scary --
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  -- something scary or --
R:  I can't handle scary movies.  I -- last one I guess I saw was the Exorcist and that was it.
L:  Wow.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I saw that at a drive in theater.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's how far -- yeah, that's how far, uh --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- back back and then I had nightmares afterward.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
L:  And now you watch it and it's just like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- "Oh God, that's mild compared to what goes on now".
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um --
R:  But yeah, well if there were more drive ins around --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I might go more.
L:  Where do you live?
R:  Delaware.
L:  [MN] Really?  I'm up in Long Island.
R:  Long Island?
L:  [MN] I think there's one left.  I think there's Westberry -- is left.
R:  We have -- we have one that's about an hour from here.
L:  Wow.  That's -- and you know what, they were such a -- see, that I would go to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- during the summer.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  In the summer time.
L:  Just it -- 
R:  On a nice evening.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That --
R:  With the pic in the window.
L:  Yeah, that used to bring back -- boy, it brings back a lot of memories.
R:  Yeah, and you could bring your own popcorn.
L:  Yeah, but, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- either that or, you know, we go -- we do go up to the video store like you said if we can't wait for something to come out.  Um, there's always pay for view and --
R:  They have current movies on pay for view?  I've never done that.
L:  Um, they're fairly current.  I -- I would say like between -- I don't know, like six months.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You can, um, you can get -- I mean I just saw -- I think that was the last movie I saw entirely was Panic Room.
R:  Yeah.
L:  With -- with Jodie Foster.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I don't think that's been out over a year.
R:  Mhm, I don't know.
L:  But I -- you know, I don't -- I don't follow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I don't follow.
R:  Well, sometimes I see ads on TV and I say, "Oh, I'd like to see that movie.  I'll wait till it comes out on video" and then when it comes out on video, I'm not that interested anymore.
L:  Or I forget what I wanted to see.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, they have all the trailers and stuff and, like, when you rent a video and I'm like, "Right, write that one down.  That one looks good --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- that one looks good".  But I tell you, most nights I am -- I don't even have the patience for sitting.  I have way too much to do [LAUGH].
R:  Well, that's another thing.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, if you can stop the movie and get up and go think -- you -- do -- get your laundry [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, right.  Right, we --
R:  Get some dinner.
L:  When you --
R:  Come back to the movie.
L:  When you're renting, you know, uh, but when they're on -- when they're on straight on satellite or something --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, you miss it.
R:  You miss it.
L:  You know, if I have a chance to watch it once during the hundred times it's on.
R:  Well, that's the thing then.  You -- um, they keep showing it and showing it, showing it [LAUGH] the whole month long.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The same movie again.
L:  [MN] The same movie again or I mean, there's -- there's quite a variety which I like.  I like -- you know what I like also is like life stories.  You know, true stories.
R:  Oh, hm.
L:  Um, things like that.  Actually I've -- I've watched a couple of like biographical --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, stories and, you know, I -- I -- I learned a lot.  What was the last one I -- I watched?  Oh, I watched, um, uh, about the Cuban missile crisis.  Uh, what was it called?  Thirteen Days or something like that.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And I was like, "Okay, I must have learnt about this in high school but ..." 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You know, I didn't realize how -- and the timing of -- of being -- this was when the war in Iraq was going on so the timing was just scary --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- you know, because it just showed us how much we don't know, you know.
R:  Yeah, hm.
L:  And like movies like that, yeah sometimes get you thinking so it -- you're right, it is nice to watch, you know, a Jim Carrey movie.  I liked -- you know, God, Jim Carrey or, uh -- who -- who are some of your favorite, uh --
R:  Oh, well yeah Carrey's real good.  Um, huh, my favorites.  I don't know, are there [LAUGH] -- who are the trophy stars lately?  Um, hm.
L:  Come on, what's the last movie you saw?  It's got --
R:  Actually I saw, was the worst movie in the world, what was it called?  Solaris, with Clooney.
L:  Okay.  I saw -- I saw the coming attractions and I have no idea -- what was it about?
R:  It was the stupidest movie.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, apparently it was a remake --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- um, from the fifties or something.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Oh, it was a spaceship that was going -- I don't know where -- where the spaceship was going but they were getting close to something called Solaris and it was making everybody dream funny things.
L:  [MN] Okay.
R:  Well, the dreams came to life.
L:  Oh,
R:  And George Clooney dreamt -- dreamt about his wife that was dead and she came back to life.
L:  Oh, right.
R:  So, it was really a love story.
L:  Okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  It was horrible with the --
L:  Yeah, okay.
R:  Then that's another reason why I don't want to pay that much for going to a stupid movie.
L:  What do you pay for movies down there?
R:  It was seven dollars I think.
L:  Yeah.  See --
R:  And what a waste of money and then I wasn't gonna leave because I paid that money to go there but --
L:  Right.  Then, yeah I know.  Then you're kind of stuck.
R:  Don't ever see that movie.
L:  We --
R:  You'll fall asleep.
L:  We used to have the greatest little theater down here and it was like, you know, two dollar movies.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They were a little old and it -- the funky -- it was a funky old theater but it was fun, you know and that was probably I guess the last time I went and that had to be in ninety six.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I -- I just -- and I -- I don't know, I -- I sometimes have a problem being in, uh -- no, that wasn't the last movie I saw.  The last movie I saw was the Blair Witch.
R:  Oh, boy.
L:  That's right.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I saw that in one of those little mini theaters.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And that was very disappointing.  
R:  Was it?
L:  Um --
R:  I didn't see it.
L:  I saw --
R:  I said I can't handle scary movies.
L:  I -- I -- I just -- it left you hanging.
R:  Did it?
L:  You know, and I didn't -- I didn't think it was that scary.  I thought it was funny.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, you know, and it just was -- yeah, that's right, I saw it in one of the multiplex little, you know, little do dad movies around here and of course it's -- you know, that's -- that's another thing that overwhelms me is, you know, walking in and, all right which theater do you go to and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- which movie do you want to see and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but it just -- I, you know, I'd rather be home and, you know, have the choice of what I want to see in movies.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I think, yeah, one of them here has fourteen theaters in it or something.
L:  Oh, my gosh.  That --
R:  That's what the kids do.  That's about the only thing there is for kids to do around here but that's so expensive for them.  
L:  Yeah, how many children do you have?
R:  Oh, I have two.
L:  Wow.
R:  Um, a twenty two year old and a seventeen year old.
L:  Oh, I have a twenty -- she's almost twenty one, uh, years and I have twenty one month old.
R:  What?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.
L:  So I don't have to worry about her seeing movies.  Forget it.  By the time she sees movies, you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- she can probably just dial it up or something, you know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And that's the other thing too with the -- I mean, we have a basic TV, um, -- you know, what -- whatever inch TV but you know, when the time comes to invest in something nice, you know, you can get a screen --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that-- that's -- that's so huge, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, it gives you the movie experience.
R:  Yeah, turn off the lights.
L:  That's said so, so you can save on going out but I guess it does make a nice date, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to go out and, uh, you know, sneak a couple of candy bars or whatever.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, we used -- yeah, we used to do that too, you know.
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  Bring your own popcorn.
R:  [LAUGH] I used to try.
L:  [LAUGH] And in some of -- some of the movie theaters are just -- I fell once in a theater and it was a very long time before I went back.
R:  Huh.
L:  Yeah, I fell and I hurt my knee pretty bad.
R:  Well, that's the -- that's the thing too.  If you go out, have to go to the bathroom or something, you can't see where you are when you come back.
L:  [LAUGH] And you disrupt everybody --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  -- and you're squirming in the seats.  I mean, I don't know if they've made the seats any more comfortable.
R:  They have made the seats more comfortable.
L:  Yeah, and -- and more evenly spaced.
