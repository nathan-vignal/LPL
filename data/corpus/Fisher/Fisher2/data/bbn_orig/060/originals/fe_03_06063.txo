R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  Nice to meet you.  My name's Jay.
L:  My name is Amanda.
R:  Hi, good night.  Good evening, I'm sorry [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm a Chinese and I live in Cleveland now.
L:  Oh, I am from Tennessee but I'm in New York right now --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- for school.
R:  Okay.  So, let's talk about movie today.
L:  All right.
R:  Mhm.  Do you prefer going to a theater or watching a movie at home?
L:  I would rather watch at home but I have been going out to watch them lately because I wanted to see X Men two and Matrix when it first came out.
R:  Oh.  Me too.  I like rent a movie and watch it at home.
L:  Um, yeah, but I -- I usually -- I don't -- I don't rent them.  I usually, um, just catch them on TV. 
R:  Oh.
L:  You have to wait a while but I'm kind of cheap.  I like to save money.
R:  Do you can find the, like, the newest one by that -- by that way?  I mean, the new -- new -- the new movie?
L:  Mhm.  And sometimes I watch Lifetime movies.  Do you ever watch those?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Original Lifetime movies.  They're really -- they're really cheesy and bad.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I enjoy watching them because they're funny.
R:  [LAUGH] Yes, so what were -- what was the last movie that you saw?
L:  Um, the Matrix, a couple of days ago.
R:  Oh, Matrix.  Yeah, this is new, really is.  I haven't saw it.
L:  Um --
R:  Is that good?
L:  Well, you want me to talk about it and spoil it for you?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, I -- I like the first one a lot better.  This one had a couple like scenes in it that just didn't make any sense.
R:  Oh.
L:  And there were -- there was like -- like there were three relationships going on it which I didn't think really fit into the movie.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think most movie -- I mean, the first one are much -- are usually better than the second one --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for most movies.
L:  I didn't see the first X Men but the --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- second one was very good.  I was very impressed.
R:  Oh.  I haven't been to the cinema for long time.
L:  No.
R:  When -- like when I was still a college student, my boyfriend who invited me to the cinema, just like a date but after we were married, we are not excited about going to the cinema anymore [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, well I like it more at home.  You can relax.
R:  Mhm.  Movies cost.  Both of us students so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- renting movie would be more ch- cheaper than --
L:  And at --
R:  -- going to the cinema.
L:  Yeah, at the theater as well there are always people that clap during the movie and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that yell at the screen.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that just --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- makes everyone uncomfortable.
R:  [MN] Well, um, the last movie I saw was Mulholland Drive.  Have you seen that movie?
L:  No.
R:  Oh, it's --it's a very hard to understand movie and I watch it a third -- three times and I did not get it at all so I went to the Internet and searched this, like, movie review and then I understand why the director rent[?] like many clues.
L:  Sometimes --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I even -- I just download movies.  It takes a long time and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- not exactly legal but I do it.
R:  Mhm.  I think now there's a lot of resource to get, like, free movie.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like renting from -- borrowing from local library.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And sometimes you can get free tickets from Internet so --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- that's why I haven't gone to the cinema for a long time [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hm.  Do you like mo- watching movie?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, have you seen any Chinese movie?
L:  Uh, no.  Sometimes I watch -- I don't know if this really counts but sometimes I watch old kung fu.
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Jackie Chan?  Jackie Chan?
L:  Um, sometimes.  These are, like, really old ones with, like -- well, actors that aren't very big here.
R:  Oh.
L:  And the English is dubbed over and, uh, I -- I don't know.  I really think they're entertaining.  I love them.
R:  Oh, I didn't know that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.  So what else can I talk about movie [LAUGH]?
L:  Um, what's your favorite?
R:  Mhm, I have no favorite movie. 
L:  Oh.
R:  I -- I like watching all kinds of movie like fear, or comedy or tragedy.
L:  I think my favorite would be Silence of the Lambs.
R:  Mhm, what --
L:  Have you see that one?
R:  I didn't know that.
L:  Um, well, they have sequels to it now.  They have, uh, Hannibal and Red Dragon but the original one --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I think is a lot better.
R:  Oh.
L:  Like always.
R:  Mhm.  Is -- mhm, I think it's during the [inaudible] preparing period that I saw the most movies in my whole -- in my life.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's -- it's a test of -- a test of English as a foreign language so I watched at least two movies per day.
L:  Oh, that's a good idea.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH] to access my listening so after -- after the test, I already speak of American [inaudible] movie --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so I haven't watched a movie until I saw the Mulholland Drive a couple of weeks ago.
L:  Mhm.  Are there any particular actors that you like or don't like?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because I can say that I don't Jim Carrey at all. 
R:  [LAUGH] Really?  Why?
L:  Yeah.  I don't -- I just don't think he's funny.  I think he tries to be a cartoon character.
R:  Oh.  Mhm.  I have no favorite -- or favorite actor or actress.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Mhm.  I surely -- I was, mhm, I was not very interesting nor hate movie.
L:  Uh --
R:  But which movie is really entertaining?  I mean, sometimes my husband and I rent movie and or rent a couple of movies and watch them the whole night.  It's really [LAUGH] funny.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Are you a student?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh.  Me too.
L:  Um, I'm going to a senior.  I'm trying to get an internship for the summer.  I'm studying advertising.
R:  Oh, wow.  Advertising?
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's exciting.
L:  What are you studying?
R:  Mhm, I'm applying for a graduate program accountancy.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Maybe I'll be -- I'll become an accountant.  I don't know.
L:  Oh.
R:  Well, um, what else we can talk?
L:  Um, [LAUGH] let's see.  Well, I do -- I have several favorites.  I don't think I should limit it to Silence of the Lambs.  I like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I like Hackers.
R:  Wow, Hackers, mhm.
L:  Have you watched that one?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, that was good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, oh the Big Lebowski.
R:  Bouncy?
L:  Lebowski.  It's not very well known I don't think but it's a very -- it's a very good movie and very quotable.  There's a lot of funny parts in it.
R:  Mhm.  Do you like Japanese, like Japanese animation movie?
L:  No, I don't really watch that much although [LAUGH] I did see Japanese movie called Tetsuo[?], the Iron Man.  You ever heard of that?
R:  Iron Man?
L:  Yeah.  It's -- it's disgusting.  Like this guy gets in a wreck and then he finds that pieces of metal start growing out of his body --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he turns into this big cyborg thing.
R:  Oh, no I didn't know.
L:  It's really bad.
R:  But I really like the -- a director named Yasake[?] and his animation is very beautiful.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Other -- yeah, I forgot about that.  I don't see how I did but yeah, I saw Spirited Away and I saw Kiki's Delivery Service and, oh, what's the other one?
R:  I think --
L:  The Castle in the Sky.
R:  Mhm.  The last three year the best animation nominated as Oscar is -- is his animation named --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I -- I forget its name.  I bought the DVD but it's broken so [LAUGH] I haven't --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- seen it yet.
L:  Was it Spirited Away?
R:  Yes --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think.  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, I like -- I like that but the -- the other ones like the -- the cartoons and the comic books and all that I don't -- I'm not really into it.
R:  Mhm.  I -- I like the, mhm, the American and the Japanese cartoons because I think those are suitable for adults not only children.
L:  Mhm.  I don't really like them -- they seem all the same to me.
R:  Oh.  Mhm, I don't like the Chinese animators at all because it's really childish.
L:  Oh.  Well, I guess kids are -- are who is supposed to be watching anyway.
R:  Mhm.  Sometimes, hm, it's good to watch some animation, I think.
L:  Yeah.  Um --
R:  Yes?
L:  [LAUGH] I'm just thinking.
R:  Yes.
L:  Uh.
R:  Mhm, I -- I think when I was college student ...
