R:  Hi.  My name is Hannah.
L:  Hi, I'm Patty.  I'm -- 
R:  Hi, how are you?  I'm sorry -- 
L:  I'm fine.
R:  -- I just have a bad throat today, so don't mind my -- my voice.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Oh, that's okay.  Ah -- ah, where are you from?
R:  [MN] I'm from Morgantown, West Virginia.
L:  Oh, it's not far from us.  I'm near Pittsburg.
R:  Oh, really?  Oh -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you're just seventy miles away.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Right.  Not far at all.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  Okay -- 
R:  So, what games do you play?
L:  None.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  None.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  When I heard that I thought, "This'll be a long ten minutes".
R:  Oh [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Now, you tell me because I'm --  
R:  Well, um -- 
L:  -- I'm like, ah, I don't -- I'm -- 'cause I mess on the computer a lot -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but not any games.  I'm -- 
R:  Not any games.
L:  -- I'm past that, you know?
R:  Same here but -- 
L:  So, I mean my age I think, you know --  
R:  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Oh, well, I used to -- 
L:  Did you?
R:  -- but ever since, you know, I got married I stopped playing them.  But -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- before I used to play a lot games by Sierra.  They're more of, um, quest games like Police Quest, Kings Quest and, um, what other games were there?  Um, ah, let's see, Full Throttle was a game I really liked and then there was another game called, um -- these are all like where you use your mind.  It's like a -- it's a like puzzle --
L:  Like a detective?  Kind of like a -- 
R:  -- game.  A detective, like, game.  It's like a full story.  You're -- you're in the middle of a story then at the end of the story they have a -- a set out plan.  For example, you're the king and your princess has, you know, disappeared so now you have to find her.  So, you go to various places and stuff and, you know, you slowly get over there.
L:  Now, did -- did you play games that were on the, ah, internet or did you play -- 
R:  On the internet?  Yeah.  I played, um -- I played Dave[?] [LAUGH] a lot, I can remember.
L:  What?  What's the --  
R:  But, when we first got the computer --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- there was a game called Dave.  I don't know if you've played it.
L:  No.  I've he- -- I've heard nothing.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  We got -- we got -- our first computer was in nineteen ninety three or ninety four, I think.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I don't think the internet was really, um, like, you know, common at that time. 
L:  Right.
R:  So, the first game that I played was Dave and I'm sure everybody played Dave at that time.  You know -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it's just like you catch various stuff and you're going through various puzzles and maze's and stuff.  It was a very -- a kid like game.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  The first game was Pacman though, if I remember right.
L:  Well, yeah.  We used to play that on, like, a [MN] -- the kids played the Atari.
R:  Atari, right, right -- 
L:  Yeah, see my kids are probably your age -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, ah, and thirty and thirty two.  I don't know you -- 
R:  Oh, right, I'm -- I'm almost -- I'm twenty seven.  Maybe a little --
L:  Okay, yeah.  Then, oh, yeah my --  
R:  -- younger than -- yeah.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  -- daughter's twenty nine.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I shouldn't say she's thirty yet.
R:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  But, ah, [LAUGH] and so they probably should have had this call except they don't live here anymore.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  So, I thought, "What the heck.  I'll learn something".  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  But -- 
R:  But, these games are really interesting if you have time.  They -- they have so -- so many interact- -- active games now, they're just like so -- 
L:  Now, when you play them well, did you play them by yourself or are there other people?
R:  Well, um, actually like there was this game -- ah, the games that I play they're by Sierra.  I think ones sierra dot com -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  They have so many games like this.  They have like, um, the swat team -- 
L:  Mm.  [MN] 
R:  You're a member of the swat team and stuff -- 
L:  Sure.
R:  And then Kings Quest was good.  Police Quest, you're a member of the police force.  You know, you're trying to find a killer and -- 
L:  And that -- well, would there be other people playing at the same time?
R:  Oh, no, actually -- 
L:  No.  Just you.
R:  -- in these cases there weren't other people playing --  
L:  Right.
R:  They are but, um, their saved games are different points.  You know, for example my -- I'm -- I'm player A.  My game is s- -- ah, saved at a different point in the -- 
L:  I see.
R:  -- story line.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And their game is saved at a different story line.  So, that's how it was.  But, um, games that you could play together, like, the only games I remember was -- were, um, there was one called Bank Robbers or something.  We have to get on the train and steal like the loot -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- in the train.  That -- that's what I remember we used to play together.  Pacman I remember very well.
L:  Yes.
R:  Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I remember Street Fighter.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know if you -- Mortal Combat.  I think those required two -- two people.
L:  Mm.
R:  But, they're mostly fighting games where you have to beat the other person [LAUGH] up.
L:  Well, I have a question, yeah -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- do you think they're violent?  Do you think that -- 
R:  Um -- 
L:  -- has anything to do with kids being violent?
R:  They -- it's true because, like, when you see, like, people having guns and you know like those, um, fake guns and all where they used to shoot each other and pretend -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- playing cops and robbers.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, that's how they're -- we get that stuff here, you know?  You just go bam bam. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  And it's [LAUGH] -- I -- I just -- I don't have a real opinion on that.  I just -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- wondered.  I feel -- one opinion I have is I think the kids, um, don't get enough exercise.
R:  That's true.  They sit all the time on the computer -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, yeah.  But, the thing is, um -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I was a girl.  I wasn't more stuff -- more -- more into the fighting and stuff like my brother was.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I was more into these interactive games where you use your mind to solve puzzles -- 
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, like, you're like a detective.  You know how they [several inaudible words] -- 
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  That's how it was based on.  You go to various people, you talk to them.  And there was another one called Mean Street.  That was a very good game.  I really liked that.  Um, that was interesting.  That was, ah, like -- in the end you're like, "Wow, what a game".  [LAUGH] 
L:  Now, how long would it take you on average to -- 
R:  It -- it could take -- it could take days -- 
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- you could just finish in four, five days and there's one called Gabrielle Knight[?].  It's a series he has.  I still haven't gotten into his second or third game.  But, one is called Gabrielle Knight and the Sins of the Fathers.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  One is called Gabrielle Knight and the Beast Within.
L:  Now, how, um, did you pay that one or do you -- 
R:  Well, actually -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- back home we just borrowed from off -- from each other.
L:  Sure.
R:  And now we have -- it's so expensive nowadays  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Are they?
R:  -- yeah.
L:  Ah, but, I don't know.  That's -- 
R:  Um, like Nintendo games for explain are, like, for forty nine dollars.
L:  Mm.
R:  Yeah, and I mean -- I mean, how much can you afford buying all these?  And, like, if you go to, like, Block Buster and all, I think they're like for seven bucks a piece or five bucks, like for two days or three days or something like that.
L:  Ah, then they, yeah -- 
R:  But, you can't finish and we -- we had -- we borrowed a Play Station from somebody.
L:  Right.
R:  And we got this game.  But, it's -- it's -- there was so much shooting in that game.  You were just running around killing people.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And we -- we got it off the -- 
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- um, ah, and there's another one called Grand Theft Auto.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That's also in, um -- 
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  It sounds real good.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Yeah.  That was a good game.  I mean, it was interesting but it -- it just kept on hanging at every point.  I think the CD was bad.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, we just gave up and returned and we got another one.  But, yeah, it was a good game on Play Station.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And -- and the -- the sound effects are so good.  You're just, you know, mesmerized by it [LAUGH] sometimes.
L:  You're shot -- you feel like you're dead.  And you can really tune out the world while you're on --
R:  That's true.  That's true.
L:  -- that, huh?
R:  You're just like --  
L:  Is that -- 
R:  -- 'cause there was another game I remember that Play Station had where you're actually running on the pad -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- an eye pad.  I don't know what's it called, where -- where you actually, ah, get on the pad and you're running and then there's hurdles come up and you're jumping and it's just on the TV that -- it's an interactive game -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [several inaudible words] I never played that one.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Now, ah, yeah, the [several inaudible words] dumb question.  So, Play Station, does that play on the television or on the --  
R:  Yeah.  It -- it -- 
L:  -- computer?
R:  -- plays on the television.  It's like a -- 
L:  That's what I thought.  Okay.
R:  -- mini computer for games, it's specifically.
L:  Well, I -- 
R:  They have two -- two control things, you know, and then you put -- 
L:  The joy stick's kind of like the old Atari had -- 
R:  Yeah, they are.  Right, right, right.
L:  -- that idea, okay.
R:  Um, like when you go to a -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- Circuit CD, or Best Buy, they'll be like in Walmart they have a -- a separate section.  You'll see little boys playing with them.
L:  Right.  Well, we just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- have a new grandson.  So, I'll probably -- 
R:  Right, right, right.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  -- eventually learn this.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  You mention, oh, there's something -- by the time he grows up I'm sure something more modern will come up.  But -- 
L:  I can't -- it -- it -- it changes so fast.
R:  It changes so fast -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah.  I've played a lot of games but it's been ages now.  I have one but it's been pending.  It's just been saved in the computer.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's, um, Kings Quest Five and I've just been stuck on it.  I mean, um, it's, ah, like, you now, how -- how they have Kind Arthur and stuff -- 
L:  Right.
R:  So, it's -- that's -- that's what the story is based on.
L:  They probably have, like, all kind -- like civil war type things -- 
R:  Yeah, they do.  They do.
L:  -- too for people that are in to that.
R:  That's, ah, they do.  I think there's -- um, there's one called Civilization I used to play.  That is really good.  You build a civilization.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You build -- you start with, um, like, you go to a -- start over any part of the world.  You take that portion, you start with like, for example, masonry and then engineering -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and then you build your whole civilization.  And then the Romans come in and then the Indians -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and so on, so forth.  And then, you know how you start growing and become -- make a civilization?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And then you start -- you slowly start, um, sort of promoting yourself.  For example, ah, you become Emperor in the end.  But you -- 
L:  Mhm.  And somebody kills you?
R:  Ah, no -- 
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  It -- it -- it's possible.  But, no, no, no -- 
L:  No, huh.
R:  -- they don't kill you, but they take over your land --
L:  Ah, I see.
R:  -- if you don't make the right moves.
L:  Okay. 
R:  You have to --
L:  Right.
R:  -- direct your army -- 
L:  You're that kind of -- [several inaudible words] re-elected.
R:  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] Okay -- 
R:  But, exactly the -- 
L:  -- another one.
R:  That's how they have it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's like, um, you -- you have an army head that -- that -- that directs you.  There's one from the commerce head.  You know, you're like the president, for example.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And there're all these -- like, your secretary's over there, in the olden times.  This is how it, like, starts in Civilization.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And then it moves on slowly.  That was a really good game.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think they have it on line.  It's -- it's on -- it's from Yahoo.  If you go into Civilization you can play it over there. 
L:  Okay.
R:  But, it was a really famous game back in ninety five, ninety six.  Civilization.  I really love that game but I never -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- made it too -- to emperor.  [LAUGH] 
L:  No.  And now -- 
R:  I was -- 
L:  -- now would you -- 
R:  -- I was -- 
L:  -- talk to your friends about it.  Like, would you be -- 
R:  My cousins and my brother were most -- mostly into it. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  My friends are all girls [LAUGH] so, like -- 
L:  Your what?
R:  My friends, you know, they're all mostly girls who were not into computer games -- 
L:  No.
R:  -- like I was or my brother.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, he would borrow with his friends so we would all play together.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't -- I don't -- I'm going to have to ask my kids if they -- I don't know, 'cause they -- well, they finished high school like in -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah, eighty nine and ninety one.
R:  Right.  Right.  Uh-huh.
L:  So, they were in college at those points and -- 
R:  I'm sure they must have played Civilization -- 
L:  Oh, sure they probably have.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- at one point, yeah, but it's -- it's a great game.  [LAUGH] It's -- it's a m- -- it's a game which you kids should play -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- to learn strategy.  There's -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- no violence in it.  And it -- it -- it's more of a mind building game -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- I think so.  I'd love -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- my kids to learn to play Civilization -- 
L:  That sounds like a -- like a gifted -- 
R:  Yeah.  It's a -- 
L:  -- kind of [inaudible] [LAUGH] -- 
R:  It's a good game.
L:  -- kids [several inaudible words].
R:  It's good, I mean, but to become an emperor takes a long time.  [LAUGH] 'Cause I mean it -- you need to have a really, um -- you know how you have an army mind where you're -- where you're -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- building and, you know, connecting and stuff, you know -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- you need to have that.  But, you know -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that was a good game.  What else?  Um, Mean Streets was very good and [several inaudible words] if I need to recommend to somebody, they're all -- but, I -- I don't know, compared to the technology today, I don't know how, um -- 
L:  How, ah, how -- 
R:  -- how old or how the kids -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- would like it.  How it's -- so, like, we consider Atari so old, you know?  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  I -- I know.  Yeah.  Palm -- 
R:  So, those were good games.
L:  -- or something was the first game I think.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Yeah.  But I remember -- 
L:  It just was a little thing that went back and forth.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  That's true.  [LAUGH] Ah, look I'm -- like on CNN the other day was showing Grand Theft Auto, it doesn't reflect a good name for people to actually +steal -- steal cars and -- 
L:  No.  No.
R:  -- then, you know?  Yeah.
L:  You wouldn't think you'd want to buy that for your child.
R:  Yeah, that's true.  But, the game -- 
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- is so interesting though, you know?  He's getting out of prison.  I remember the beginning though, and then they take him to a -- oh, they h- -- you know, steal all these cars in a garage.  You know, they rebuild the cars and you know, make them --  
L:  And now these are on the computer?
R:  These are all the good Play Station games -- 
L:  Yes, okay.
R:  -- I was remembering, yeah.  So, they were -- they're good games, yeah.
L:  Mm.
R:  But, nowadays we buy kids games, you know, for my nieces and nephew, like, Barbie.
L:  Right.
R:  Barbie Sparkling Ice Show and so on -- 
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- so forth.  We just bought one.  We just sent -- yeah, we gave that as -- the +Barbie Sparkling -- ah, Barbie Sparkling Ice Show or something like that -- 
L:  Now, how is she -- how old is she to -- 
R:  Oh, they're -- 
L:  -- like that?
R:  -- um, they range from twelve to, let's see what's the last one, 'til four, yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah, but you know, my niece and nephew, they play a lot of interactive games where they learn, um, spelling and reading.
L:  Okay, that's -- yeah -- 
R:  And Reader Rabbit and stuff like that and yeah, and -- 
L:  Oh, yeah, what is that?  Read, ah -- 
R:  Reader Rabbit I think that's what it's called.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they're so good.  I mean he's -- 
L:  [inaudible] Patch, what are those?  Those are books, aren't they?
R:  I think so. 
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  So, you can tell, I've been away from this kids thing -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- for a long -- 
R:  I'm sure when you're grandson grows up you'll be more involved in it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I'm sure.  Yeah.
R:  But, ah, yeah.  I mean, he's really picked up on reading because of that because they've really -- like, you know, that you play in the meantime, you're also learning.
L:  Ri- right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, those are really good games that, um -- 
L:  That's good.  That is -- 
R:  -- that you could give nowadays.
L:  -- educational.
R:  Yeah, my daughter's too small right now.  She's only, like, a year old.  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, she wouldn't be -- 
R:  No, she wouldn't.
L:  But, I -- I think it's really young though that they do --
