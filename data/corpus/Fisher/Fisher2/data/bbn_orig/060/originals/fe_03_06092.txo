L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, I remember, um, I -- the first, ah, computer game that I bought was MIST.

R:  Well, shit.  [LAUGH] --

R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [MN] I have a methods game, um, like, um, [NOISE] the other SIM games like SIM Tower, SIM City.  Kimmy, can you wait just a minute please?  Um, and, um, what else do I like?  Roller Coaster Tycoon.  Um, [MN] there's one that's like a simulated zoo [NOISE] but I forget what -- 
R:  What's Roller -- 
L:  -- it's called.
R:  -- I'm sorry, but what's Roller Coaster Tycoon?
L:  Um, you build a theme park.
R:  Oh --

R:  Psychology.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, okay, interesting.  That's cool.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yes, I like -- you sound like a businesswoman by the computer games you play. 
L:  [LAUGH] My minor [NOISE] is marketing.   
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Sounds good.  Yeah -- 
L:  Yeah.  But, um, let's -- 
R:  -- that's inter- -- 
L:  -- see.  What other kind of computer games do I like or what other kinds -- 
R:  Ah -- 
L:  -- are there?  Um [NOISE] -- 
R:  Um -- 
L:  Kimmy.  Kimmy.  Mommy's on the phone, okay?  Um -- 
R:  Um, well, ah, ah, what else is there?  Um -- 
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- well, see, my brother, he sits in front of the computer screen twenty four seven all day long -- 
L:  What does he play?
R:  Um, he usually plays like those Doom or Quake or something like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, and then you know those, ah -- I just don't -- I just don't think it's that great.  Like, it just -- it's so hypnotizing as well, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Your --
L:  I've never tried those but I -- 
R:  -- competitive nature kicks in.
L:  -- would imagine it would be.  I would -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- think that it would be pretty [LAUGH] -- 
R:  And it -- it's like -- it's -- it's not -- it's not a good thing 'cause like whenever you have boyfriends or whatever, and things like that and they're just engrossed in it so long -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it just goes -- it just kicks off their social life [several inaudible words] -- I'd rather read a book or something --
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- like that other than playing a computer game.  I don't know, I just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- don't agree with it at all.
L:  Yeah.  I don't -- 
R:  But, yeah.
L:  -- probably so I would imagine [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- that it probably wouldn't be pretty, ah, life enveloping.  [LAUGH] --
R:  It -- it was probably what?
L:  I said I imagine that it probably wouldn't envelope peoples' lives like the -- those type of games.  I never played them but I guess that -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- people get pretty -- 
R:  I -- 
L:  -- into 'em.  [MN] 
R:  So, how long, um, a day -- how many times a day do you play or -- 
L:  Ah, goodness, I don't know.  Maybe, um, when I work I -- I don't work outside my house anymore so --
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- probably not that long 'cause I just want time to go on with work and I probably [several inaudible words].  That's probably two hours a day, I would think probably, at least.
R:  On your breaks or, like, during --
L:  Yeah, just like -- 
R:  -- work [LAUGH] -- 
L:  -- during work.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Right -- 
L:  During work usually.  [LAUGH] That's -- 
R:  That's funny.
L:  -- pretty much my kind of [inaudible].  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Whereas --
L:  During work but, um -- 
R:  -- I'll go straight -- go straight -- 
L:  -- I'm sure most people probably play during work 'cause -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there's nothing else to do.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, um, I actually host -- I'm a hostess at [inaudible] so I can't --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- really play anything there.
L:  Right.
R:  But, um, you have, like, whatever -- ah, I mean, I could be [several inaudible words] if you like that in -- in school.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Also, um, pretty much students like computer games.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, ah, yeah, that's about it.  But, there's, like, now.  You're going to play so much more and interact with people which is pretty interesting.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah [LAUGH] --  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] not just, ah, drive off the curb [several inaudible words] like -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- "Oh, my gosh, you're driving off the curb".  [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, ah, now like, ah, whatever -- the internet -- 
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- I mean, you can't -- wh- which is pretty interesting where I see my brother playing pool with someone else that he doesn't know.
L:  Mhm.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  You know, like, you can do that.  Other than going out, you know -- 
L:  Ah [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- you can just --
L:  Ken's on the camera.
R:  -- sit your lazy butt -- 
L:  Too much noise.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  Hello?
L:  [NOISE] I -- I'm sorry, my kids are [inaudible].  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  That's okay.  That's okay -- 
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- no problem.  But, ah, you can just sit down and kick back and play a computer game and play pool at your own, like -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- time at home -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- which is pretty cool.  I find that interesting.  But, then that just gives fat America to -- another excuse to stay home with their --
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- lazy butts.
L:  Now, my -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- my three year old is already into computer games.  She really likes -- 
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- um, [MN] like, um, you know, like Dora the Explorer and [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- um, Blues Clues type of -- Reader -- 
R:  Oh, no, yeah.
L:  -- Reader Rabbit.  She likes those kind of games.
R:  Yeah, I've heard of that.  [LAUGH] 
L:  So [LAUGH] -- 
R:  That's cool.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  [several inaudible words]  Okay, you got it.  All right.  [LAUGH] So -- 
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- but, um, okay.  How -- ah, or -- does she already know how to use the computer, your --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- three year old?
L:  Yeah, she does.  She -- 
R:  Wow -- 
L:  -- does.  That's, ah, [several inaudible words].
R:  -- that's interesting.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Like, does -- does she go to classes or anything like that or -- 
L:  No.  [NOISE] Just -- just from watching mommy and playing around.  She -- 
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- does it pretty well.  I keep the -- my computer in the [MN] -- in the play room so that I can be in there with them while they're doing their thing -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and so she's, um [NOISE] -- you know, she sees it a lot.  [NOISE]  Kimmy, mommy's -- 
R:  That's cool.
L:  -- on the phone, okay?  Could you wait just a minute please?  Um, [NOISE] but, um, let's see.  What other kind of games can I think of?  [MN] What about like the computer games that come loaded on your computer?  Like, um, mm -- 
R:  Oh, like, ah, Solitaire --
L:  -- [inaudible] and -- yeah -- 
R:  -- and all that stuff.
L:  Those kind of things -- 
R:  Well, oh, yeah.  I actually caught myself playing that a few times.  [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, ah, yeah, like, I mean, I just -- it's about time -- 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- and I'd rather do something productive.
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  That's like my main reason why I don't play it.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  Like, I'm in to other things other than sitting --
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- in front of the computer I guess.
L:  Can you think of any kind of game that you might like?  [NOISE] -- 
R:  Um, I'd say [MN] ah, see, I don't play computer games for long.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, Solitaire.  [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's it.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Just Solitaire 'cause I have no idea.  What time -- are we -- so, how long is this?  Is it ten minutes yet?
L:  No, um, it's -- we -- I think we have, like, one more minute.  Um -- 
R:  We have one more minute?
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  [LAUGH] [NOISE] -- 
R:  Okay.  God, this is -- it's kind of difficult talking about computer games. 
L:  Right, it is.  It is. 
R:  It's pretty -- 
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- mm, I don't know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, ah, yeah, okay, the controversy on it.  They're -- they're trying to stop, ah, playing -- they're trying to stop, like, all the blood and gore games because of all the incidents.  You know, 'cause violence and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- everything like that it -- it -- 'cause you have a three year old and whenever you catch her playing, ah, do you mind if she plays -- plays those kind of games or -- 
L:  Oh, when I'm on she plays [LAUGH] word score games definitely -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I wouldn't -- sh- she would have no -- no way too.  But, yeah, certainly if she were old enough to even be able to -- to get to them, [NOISE] yeah -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- I would definitely mind.  Um, she's -- 
R:  And now a lot of the parents --
L:  -- [NOISE] it's inappropriate.
R:  -- do so -- 
L:  All right.
R:  -- it's -- it's -- so, would you be opposed or, ah -- 
L:  Well, I think -- 
R:  -- for it?
L:  -- that -- that -- that parents should be in control of the children [NOISE] and -- and they should -- I have a -- a nine year old also and he doesn't, um -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- he doesn't -- he -- he knows which things he's allowed to play and which things he's not and it's no different than doing anything else he's not allowed to do.  I mean, I'm not going to let him do it.  [LAUGH] --  
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And, ah, there will be consequences if he does.  So --  
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  [NOISE] [MN] 
R:  I understand that.
L:  Mhm.  [MN] [NOISE] Okay -- 
R:  But, um -- 
L:  -- [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  -- so you -- have you caught your --
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- nine year old doing --
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- anything like that?
L:  No.  No, I haven't ever.  He's -- he's a pretty good --
R:  Oh -- 
L:  -- kid.  He pretty much does what he's supposed to do.
R:  -- see, he's doing it behind your back.  [LAUGH] Just kidding.
L:  No, I don't think so.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Okay.  That's good.
L:  I don't think so.
R:  That's good.  Well, ah -- 
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- ah, how about, like, in school programs and things like that, do they -- do they, like, have time where, ah, this student -- like your nine year old -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- does he go off and -- 
L:  Yeah, they have -- well, they --  
R:  -- start the computer?
L:  -- have, um -- they incorporate computers into all of their, um, all their regular subjects.  They have them in their regular class and -- 
R:  Okay, that's good.
L:  -- so -- and then they also have a --
