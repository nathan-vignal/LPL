L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  My name's Kate.
R:  Hi Kate.  My name's Zelda.
L:  Hi.  Um, so we're supposed to talk about computer games.
R:  Right.
L:  Um -- 
R:  Ah [MN] -- 
L:  -- I -- I don't really play computer games very often.
R:  Ah, if it's computer games the only one I play which I'm competing with a computer is, um, I play Solitaire ev- every day.  Not -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Solitaire, not Solitaire, I'm sorry, Free Cell.
L:  Free Cell, yeah.
R:  Free Cell [MN] I'm at up to, ah, eight hundred and thirty seven when I started counting the -- let me start counting, I've won eight hundred and thirty seven games.
L:  Oh, wow -- 
R:  And there's actually thirty -- 
L:  In a row?
R:  -- thousand -- ah, not in a row, but I'm up to -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- from -- 
L:  Wow.
R:  -- the -- the games go from zero to three -- thirty thousand.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I'm like eight hundred and thirty seven.  I'm like, "By the time I'm done with this I'm going to be real old" but --  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I should -- I used to try to do at least one a day but then I got -- I would get addicted and I would do a few more but now that, um, I've been doing a lot of different things on the computer -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I don't really have time to play the computer games and yet the only game that I play on a CD is pinball machines 'cause my husband has that and I like playing that because I actually really don't watch much TV at all.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I don't -- I rather, um, read, go out, listen to music. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I like to watch a movie.  I'll watch a movie and I'll listen to news but I don't have time to sit down especially now with the weather, you know -- 
L:  Yeah, I watch a lot more movies than I play computer games.
R:  Yes.
L:  Do you know of Nude[?]?
R:  Do I know what?
L:  Nude?
R:  No.
L:  It's just like weird.  It's kind of like, almost like Tetris but kind of like backward.  Instead of the pieces falling, you have to like shoot at these little, like, creatures.  I think they're called nudes and like, I don't know, you got points.  It's -- it's really like -- it came out -- it's free.  You download it on the internet -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and, um, my freshman year of college I got it and it -- it -- it's an interesting game.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It -- it's very, ah, mind numbing actually and it's addictive.  Like, when I first downloaded it I just like played Snood[?] all the time.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Like, that's it.  [LAUGH] And, um, like it would start -- you could get streaks [several inaudible words] to different levels you can get to and, like, I don't know, I've got kind of addicted to that.  It got to the -- the point where, like, when I try and go to bed at night and I shut my eyes, I would see, like, [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  -- a Snood game.  So, I thought [several inaudible words] like, this has to stop.  This is no good.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  But, I -- I haven't really -- and that happens pretty much in every computer game now.  Like, if I play Free Cell too much or Solitaire or, like, any game [LAUGH] that doesn't [inaudible] require, like -- like we also have Jeopardy on CD rom --  
R:  Right, and I -- I -- 
L:  -- and I play that sometimes but, um -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, that, like, since they're different questions, I don't really like -- that doesn't happen.  When I shut my eyes at night I don't see, like -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know, Alex Trebek.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  I actually -- my son had given me a CD rom on, um, what's the other one?  Ah -- ah, Wheel of Fortune.  And I've played that on Wheel.  I -- I was getting, like, I played that too.  I've never played it anymore.  I forgot all about that and now you've made me think of it.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right, but only -- 
L:  Yeah, this is a -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I didn't play that.  Sometimes I do.  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, you know, I can't be -- I don't really have time for a lot of games.  You know, I work full time.  I commute and then I have another part time job, like I'm a mystery shopper so I don't have time for all of that.  But -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- my kids are always playing certain kind of games.  But, they have to pay for this game.  I don't know.  It's all on the internet and they talk -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- to other people -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- while they're playing games.  But, I'm not into any of that.  I don't have time for that.
L:  Yeah.  I'm a student and a lot of my -- my guy friends will have, um, you know, Play Station, all that and they play, like, Grand Theft Auto and Halo, I think, is the other one.  And, like, they're just -- they're like obsessed.  Like, some -- the -- they can't organize themselves to, like, do anything productive.  But, if they're going to play a video game together, like, they're so organized about it.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I -- 
L:  It's kind of funny.
R:  -- I notice that with, ah, kids now because, like, my, ah, my kids range from the ages of nineteen to twenty five.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, I mean, I -- I'm not -- I have no coordination to pick up one of those games.
L:  Yeah.  Me neither.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  I mean, to hold it and to press so far, and [inaudible] I'm like, "Oh, my goodness.  Oh, I -- I can't, I don't know" and -- and they're so good at it because I'm not -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- used to it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They grew up on it too, that's why.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I mean, I never played, like, Nintendo or anything when I was little and I guess it's because my -- it's just me and my sister and my family and, um, so, like, we weren't very, like, video game oriented -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- anyway maybe just 'cause we're girls.
R:  I think boys play that more anyway.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The guys -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yes.
L:  So, we never got that.  So, I can't work the controller.  I don't know what to do.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't know how to work those controllers either -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- at all.  No.
L:  Oh, [several inaudible words] I'm glad 'cause it's kind of an expensive habit.  Like, those games -- first you buy the system and that's like a couple hundred dollars -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- but, the game is like fifty bucks.
R:  Right.
L:  So, one less thing [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- [several inaudible words]
R:  Right.  And when you're on the internet they're always popping up all kind of game -- games to play.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, even, um, gambling too.  All kinds -- 
L:  Yeah, like -- 
R:  -- of stuff.  But -- 
L:  -- Casino kind of games?
R:  Casino's like -- I just -- I just ignore them.
L:  Yeah, that's -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  They're really annoying.  I hate the way they pop up like that.
R:  Yeah.  Mhm, me too.  Especially if I'm reading something and it --  
L:  Yeah, I totally agree.
R:  -- pops up, "Get out of my way".  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  What state are you calling from?
L:  Connecticut.
R:  Connecticut.  Oh, I'm in Massachussetts.
L:  Oh.
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] cool, we're not so far away.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  So -- 
L:  I'm -- this is my third call, I think.  Are you only supposed to get three?
R:  Yeah.  This is my third call.
L:  Huh.
R:  So, also -- 
L:  Yeah.  This is like -- this has been fun.  [LAUGH] I enjoy this.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I know, I've spoken to, um, three different people all in three different states.  Now, Connecticut, New York and California and, ah, but this is --  
L:  California, wow.
R:  -- yeah, but this is interesting.  I mean, ah, [SIGH] the topics.  But --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, right, there's not really much that we can talk about.  I really don't play much accept Free Cell is really what I play and it's -- it's a CD -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's a CD rom.  I -- I have the pinball one which I like to play the pinball one and that's it.
L:  Have you -- have you heard of, um, the Sims?
R:  No.
L:  It's this weird -- we had it and then I, like, accidentally [inaudible] the game and you need the password that's on the CD case which was thrown away.  So, we don't have it anymore.  But, um, it's like simulated people and you -- you build them a house and you furnish it and, like, make them do things -- 
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  -- you have to get them a job and, like, that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- is one addictive game also.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  It's really bad.  But, it's kind of funny because, um, you dictate their every action or you can -- you can just, like, let them do what they want.  But, you can make them cook dinner and, like, make them brush their teeth and, like, make them go to work and do all kinds of stuff or they just kind of like hang out and do what they want.  But, they usually don't go to work unless you make them and if they -- 
R:  [LAUGH] --  
L:  -- don't go to work, they don't get paid, so then they can't eat.  [LAUGH] It's -- 
R:  It's pretty cool -- 
L:  -- kind of funny.
R:  -- I mean, I -- I -- I wouldn't mind playing that game, see how it works.  I mean, yeah, if you don't go to work, you don't eat.  You don't go to work, you don't have anything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's like, make -- 
L:  It's -- 
R:  -- [several inaudible words] we have to go.  We have to discipline ourselves anyway.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Yeah, it's fun.  It's -- it's really funny though 'cause, like, it's just so addictive.  And then you're walking around your house later on and you're like, you know, you start to walk to the refrigerator and then realise you have to use [several inaudible words] turn around and, like, that's exactly the kind of stuff the Sims do when you leave them to themselves.  So -- 
R:  [LAUGH] What is the -- 
L:  -- you're like, "Wait".  [LAUGH] 
R:  What is the name of this game?
L:  It's called the Sims.  S.I.M.S.  It's stands -- 
R:  Okay, the Sims.
L:  -- for the simulated people -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I think.
R:  Oh, I got to -- 
L:  So -- 
R:  I got to check that out.
L:  Yeah, and when I was, um, in middle school they had this game -- actually they still have it.  It's probably better now, but it was Sim City which is, like, you build a -- like, you build an entire town and you have to [several inaudible words] like the water and the electricity and, like, taxes and the budget.
R:  Oh, well actually that's good because it's a game but you're learning.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, you're learning, ah, everything about life economics and all that.
L:  Yeah.  And it's -- 
R:  Oh, it's -- 
L:  -- also very addictive.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  We actually still have that on the computer but once you figure out how to make a city work it's just kind of isn't as fun anymore.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, it's not.  So, now you can be a mere [MN] [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Once, yeah, it's pretty good.  I think that that's good for the -- I think that's an educated -- educated games that can be fun is really good that you can take with you, you know, use it in life.  I think that's -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- great.  Yeah.  But, some -- 
L:  It's good when they trick you too so you don't actually know you're learning stuff.
R:  Right.  I don't -- 
L:  But -- 
R:  -- like the games that have a lot of blood which I've seen a lot -- 
L:  Bad.
R:  -- of killing.  The guys play that 'cause my boy -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- my kids play that.
L:  Others -- others, like Play Station games and stuff.
R:  Right.  And even on the internet -- they played this on -- some kind of game on the internet.  I don't know.  It's really weird.  And there's so much fighting and killing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I -- it's too, um, [MN] violent.  I don't like it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I don't much like those [inaudible] either.
R:  No.
L:  And I don't -- I definitely wouldn't like pay you to do it.  [LAUGH] Like, I -- because someone once said you have to actually, like, pay twenty bucks just to play this game for, like -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- an hour.
R:  Right.  They pl- -- yeah, they pay.  They actually pay with their credit cards to play.  But, they can build cities.  It's really different.  I don't know, but, um --
