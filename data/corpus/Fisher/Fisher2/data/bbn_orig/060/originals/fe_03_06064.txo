R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  My name is --
L:  I'm Natalie.
R:  I'm Alesha.
L:  Hi, Alesha.  Where -- what's -- where are you?  What -- what state?
R:  Um, Pennsylvania.
L:  Okay, I'm in California.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So, yeah [LAUGH].
R:  [COUGH]
L:  We're all the way across the country.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, our topic is what?
R:  Um, movies.
L:  Movies.
R:  And if you like to see them in the movie theater or if you like to rent them and the last movie you saw I think.
L:  What do you prefer?
R:  I think I prefer to rent movies.
L:  Yeah, I think I do too.  I -- I -- I like the stop function.
R:  Yes.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Pause.
L:  The pause function.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, it's a hassle I think to get out to the theaters and you spend what, five times as much money.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.
L:  And then if you have to hire a sitter [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  You have to hire a baby-sitter and then the food is outrageous.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I don't know.  I mean I don't mind.  I think if there's a big one that comes out that supposed to be really great.  What was the movie I saw?  Gladiator.  Years ago, you know that they said you really need to see on the big scene because of the panoramic shots and all this stuff.
R:  Right.
L:  I don't mind but if it's just the story you're following, I would rent it and stay home and watch it.
R:  Yeah, and it's nice, you know, in the comfort of your house, you can -- like you said you can just pause it and get up to go to the bathroom or --
L:  Right, and you can set the volume at whatever temperature -- or whatever height you want.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And the temperature.  I mean, sometimes I go to the theater in the summer time and it's freezing cold [LAUGH].
R:  Definitely.
L:  It's just way too cold or you don't know who's going to be in there.  I mean, I suppose it depends on what kind of movie you're seeing but, you know, I just -- in our neighborhood anyway you get some really rough crowds seems like that hang out.  Um, I'm in Northern California-- 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and it seems like some kids -- a lot of kids just hang out at the theater.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, so I don't --
R:  A -- a place to hang out and --
L:  Yeah, yeah so it's not -- I don't know and like I say, depends -- well it really depends on what kind of movie you're seeing so what -- what was the last movie you saw?
R:  Oh my word, I haven't been to the movies like in --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- forever.
L:  I'm trying to think.  I took my kids to see the Jonah movie.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Um --
R:  Yeah, I took my daughter to see, um, Spirit.
L:  Yeah, we saw Spirit.  Okay, I saw that with my kids and my -- my five --six year old cried.  
R:  Oh.
L:  Said it was the saddest thing I ever saw [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, my --
R:  Yeah, I think that was probably the last movie I saw in the movie theater was Spirit.
L:  Yeah, I'm trying to think.  What -- I know I went to see something before that but boy, it didn't make that bigger of an impression of me, did it --
R:  No.
L:  -- if I can't remember the name of it [LAUGH].
R:  Right.
L:  Um, I don't know.  Big ones like Titanic.  I like to see action movies sometimes in the theaters.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  My husband just went and saw the Matrix tonight.
L:  Oh, the new one?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Now, see that might be, because of the special effects, that might be the kind of place to be in a theater.
R:  Yeah.
L:  With the surround sound and, you know, the big screen and everything.
R:  With all the, um, fight scenes and the action scenes.  He said that was really good.
L:  Yeah, but you need to be -- you know and -- and you can see it uninterrupted and really get into it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I think I saw a drama -- was the last one that I saw.  I can't even remember.  That's pretty sad.
R:  [MN]
L:  Except for the kids ones.  You know, the Jonah.  But the thing about taking the kids to the theater then again, is they get just as excited if we rent a movie --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and we stay home and pop popcorn --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- as opposed to going out and spending twenty dollars just on the food [LAUGH] --
R:  Yep, and --
L:  -- for the kids.
R:  Yeah, and, um, like my daughter got up and had to go twice to the bathroom while we were watching Spirit and, um, spilled the popcorn so it was just kind of more of a hassle [LAUGH].
L:  Right, right.  And you get up in the middle of the show and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  No, I mean I -- I -- I see sometimes previews and I think, "Oh, I think I need to -- I need to see that at the theater".
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I need to get out and see that at the theater and then -- and then I think, "Well I can't wait till it comes out on video [LAUGH]".
R:  Yeah.  
L:  So that's the next -- that's the next step but I think the frequent renter cards at the video stores make it more reasonable to rent.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, and even our local library rents movies.
R:  Oh, yes.  So does ours.
L:  Or they check 'em for free as long as you keep them less than a week [LAUGH].
R:  Right [MN].
L:  [LAUGH] They're cheap, so but I don't know.  I just -- I think just the scene of the theaters is not -- is not very -- it's not very desirable for me --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to go and hang out.
R:  And you never know, you could get this super tall person --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- sitting in front of you and you can't see half the movie.
L:  Right, right.  Although the st- stadium theaters -- most of the theaters near here are stadium theaters --
R:  Are they?
L:  -- and so, yeah, almost all of our [NOISE] stadium theaters.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So, that -- there -- virtually you don't have anybody in front of you --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- so that's really nice.
R:  Yeah, we have -- we just started getting some with stadium seating around here and it's only in the back of the theater.
L:  Well, then that definitely cuts the movie viewing out.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because, you know, your feet -- although the last show we went to -- that's right.  I -- I remember now, I went to see, um, like Big Fat Greek Wedding and in the theater just because --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- I wanted something to do but our feet stuck to the floor.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  There was so much junk. I'm sorry.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I was like, "Okay, I mean I'm -- this is gross".
R:  Yeah, that is --
L:  "I don't wanna be here.  We could have rented this movie".
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] "Why did we got see it?  Why didn't we rent it?"  So ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.  I don't know, but renting I -- do you guys have a rental place near you?
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, and I -- I prefer to rent.  This -- I mean, the pain is sometimes they don't have the movie that you want to see but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they could be all out but it's still -- yeah, less than half the price --
L:  Right, it's only --
R:  -- than to go to the movies.
L:  -- a few dollars.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well like our local Blockbuster I think has a -- they have, uh, the one mo- free movie a month, like, if you subscribe for the one year for nine dollars, they give you a free movie every month and then you rent, like, two movies and you get one free.  I mean, I hardly ever even pay it seems like for -- to rent a movie.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So, and -- and see even if -- like I just got free movie passes for the kids to see that Finding Nemo --
R:  Yeah, okay.  Yeah.
L:  -- which the grocery store gave them to me.  I -- you know, I got 'em from the grocery store so, um -- but I'm -- I'm dreading it.  I've got free movie passes but I'm dreading it because I'm thinking, "Oh, great, even if I snuck food into the movie theater --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they're gonna want to buy a four dollar, five dollar popcorn.
R:  Yep.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly, that's -- I'm thinking about taking my daughter to see that so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that'll probably be the next movie we see.
L:  That's the other thing too is the one -- the one thing that was the very worst for me is I took the kids to see a rated G movie.  I don't remember if it was Stuart Little or another G movie and the previews for the movie -- this is five -- four and five year old boys --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- the previews were rated PG thirteen --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- so that would be like taking your child to a PG or to a PG movie and them seeing rated R previews.
R:  Yeah, that's not good.
L:  And I was so -- I was really offended.  I mean, the -- the content was really offensive, it was way over their heads, it was inappropriate, it didn't -- you know, it didn't need to be shown so I complained to the theater manager.  I said, "What are you doing showing these previews?"
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's another thing, you can't control that, you know. 
R:  Right.
L:  In your house you just fast forward through 'em.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And the theater manager said, "We're not responsible for the trailers.  The movie theaters or the movie production companies tell us what we have to show".
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  Which was really lame.  I mean, I don't know if you ever go see a -- like if you go to see a comedy, you --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- have to -- you have to sit through horror previews.
R:  Yeah.
L:  See that bugs me too.  I'm like, "Wait a minute.  I paid money to see a comedy".
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't do the horror [LAUGH].
R:  Yes [LAUGH].  So, your children are four and five?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, actually two, four, six.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- at the time they were four and five, the boys were.  So, how old is your daughter?
R:  Uh, my daughter is three and I just had three month old twins so ...
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you're up late.  That's why you're up so late.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [inaudible]
R:  Yep.
L:  So, she's still pretty young for movies though.
R:  Yeah, that --  Spirit was the first movie I ever took her to see.  Just as a little test [LAUGH].
L:  So, you can still rent adult themes movies and in the evening and stuff.  See, we can't do that because the boys want to be up with us.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And we just don't [NOISE] -- you know, we -- we might rent a movie and put it on upstairs for them [LAUGH].  "You can watch, you know -- you can watch your movie upstairs, you cartoon's upstairs" and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we'll watch an adult movie.
R:  Right.
L:  So, wow twins.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Congratulations.
R:  Thank you [LAUGH]
L:  So, now you have three too.
R:  Yep.
L:  And three is a really crazy place to be.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  Three is a really -- three is fun but it's crazy.  So, your-- your twins boys or girls?
R:  One of each.
L:  Oh, wow [MN].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, how exciting.  So, now you're blessed with everything.
R:  Yes.  I was hoping for at least one boy [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, you wanted one boy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh they're a handful.
R:  Are they?
L:  Especially at the movies.  Yeah, we -- the last time we went to the theater we took nine little boys.  
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  Nine six year old boys to the movies.  Yeah, and they loved it but you know, they talked through the whole thing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- which I'm sure disrupted -- they disrupted other people.
R:  Right.
L:  And then they had to get up to go to the bathroom two or three times [NOISE] so ...
R:  [MN]
L:  Um, anyway, I'm just, uh -- I'm just looking forward to this new movie coming out so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the kid movie but your daughter's a little bit young.
R:  Yeah.  She is but when we took her to see Spirit she actually -- I went with two of my girlfriends who both have daughters who are the same age --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, she was the best behaved out of all of them.
L:  Wow.
R:  So ...
L:  That movie has the horses.
R:  Yeah.
L:  How about the Piglet?  There's ...
