R:  Hello.
L:  [NOISE] Yes, hello.  [SIGH] This is Vi.  I'm in Little Rock, Arkansas.
R:  [NOISE] This is Karen and I'm in Eugene, Oregon.
L:  Well, way, way far away. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, did you have to wait an awfully long time to get connected, this time?
R:  [NOISE] No, not really, no.
L:  Oh, because I -- I listened to a lot of piano playing --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- before we -- [LAUGH] we got connected.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- now I'm not quite sure w- w- what the topic was.  [SIGH] Did -- c- could -- did you hear her, she talked so fast I didn't understand.
R:  Yeah, it was about movies. [SIGH]
L:  Movies?
R:  Yeah, going to the movies. [MN] 
L:  Oh!
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Just going to the movies.
R:  Yeah, if you like to do that or -- or rent a movie and stay --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- home or [NOISE] ...
L:  Oh, I see.  Oh, well, d- do you want to begin or shall I?
R:  Go ahead! [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay!
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Fine --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Well, my personal preference is -- is staying at home and enjoying renting a movie [SIGH] and watching it at home.  [SIGH] Uh, I, um -- I -- I go to the -- the theaters v- very -- very seldom, uh, um, maybe, maybe two or three times a year.  [SIGH] I'd much rather rent a movie.  Uh, it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's so convenient, you have the movie at home, you -- you put it in the VCR a- and [SIGH] if -- if -- if you have to stop for any minute if a phone call comes in or whatever, [SIGH] you can stop it and then you begin again and that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that's my preference, what about you?
R:  Mine too, yeah that's mine too.
L:  You too huh? [SIGH] [MN] 
R:  Yeah!
L:  Well --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- wh- what are some of the movies that you -- you rented recently, can you think of any?
R:  Um, no!
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I haven't even rented any lately.
L:  Oh really!  Well uh -- uh the last one that can, um, remember that we rented was, um, [SIGH] uh, a movie with Tom Cruise --
R:  Oh! 
L:  -- which was -- I thought it was going to be really -- I was looking forward to seeing it, [SIGH] and -- a- [LAUGH] my friend and I rented it and we both fell asleep, so --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- that [LAUGH] kind of tells you how -- [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- how interesting it was.  Um, it -- it was about, uh -- I'm trying to think -- uh, h- he had some kind of a dream, I can't think of the name of it --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it was -- I guess maybe we must have missed the most important part --
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  -- because uh, you know, when we woke up and he -- th- things were going on but we didn't understand what was g- -- in fact I didn't even care to re- rerun it because it -- it just didn't seem that interesting.  I was really disappointed [SIGH] because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- usually Tom Cruise is pr- --you know, pretty good --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- yeah.  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, uh [MN] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- well [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well we both have decided that we'd much rather rent a movie than go to the movies, uh --
R:  Yes. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- yeah, well wh- wh- wh- what -- what more can we --
R:  [MN] [LAUGH] 
L:  -- say?  Uh --
R:  [SIGH] Mm. 
L:  -- um, did you -- did you have a topic yesterday?  Did you call or -- or talk with ...
R:  I did- [NOISE] -- I didn't call yesterday.
L:  [SIGH] Oh I see.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That -- that was a -- a lot more interesting, we [SIGH] -- we had the topic of, um, um  [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Oh God, it's slipped my mind.  [SIGH] Boy I'm -- I'm really -- I'm not here today!
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, oh, affirmative action was yesterday.
R:  Oh!
L:  So that was -- that was really interesting, uh, uh, but movies are movies are movies are movies, you [LAUGH] know! [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] What are we going to do?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh, can we talk about other things or do we have to stick to the topic?
R:  I don't know.  Um.
L:  Well, I'd rather, you know, y- you said you're in -- in -- um, where in Oregon?
R:  Eugene.
L:  Eugene.  Oh, I see.  [SIGH] Uh, you know, I have a friend who's always wanted to move to Oregon.  Uh, do you have a lot of -- of rain there?
R:  Yes --
L:  Yeah --
R:  Lots. [NOISE]
L:  -- yeah, that -- that -- that was my one thing that I thought of, [SIGH] but other than that she thinks it's, ah, pretty -- pretty neat there.  Uh, have you been there all your life?
R:  Um, most --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of it [NOISE] yes.  [NOISE]  Since, um, since I was like nine.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, I see, uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm originally from the Mid West and, uh -- but I've --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- lived here in -- in Little Rock for, gosh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the last thirty, thirty five years, so I -- I -- I don't know if you were expecting --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a southern drawl but, uh, --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I -- I never did acquire one of those things. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Uh, um, let's see --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Well, uh --
R:  [LAUGH] [MN] 
L:  -- s- s- say something.
R:  Mm. [LAUGH] 
L:  What -- what -- what? [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN] [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] You sound like you're real young, are you?
R:  I'm thirty three.
L:  Oh, that's you're young, I'm -- I'm seventy four. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh wow!
L:  [LAUGH] So that -- that's, uh, quite -- quite a few years on you, yeah.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH] Uh, uh, my children are all grown up and -- and, uh, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, gone and -- a- all over the United States so 
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Uh, two of 'em are still here with me in Little Rock, which makes it nice, uh, but the other ones are far and away so, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't get to see them real often.  Grandchildren too, you know, they have grandchildren and then they are w- with their parents and so it's very difficult [SIGH] to keep in touch.  You know, letters, and -- and of course with the computer, that helps a lot now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I -- I can get -- uh, you know, we can email back and forth but, uh, some of the kids are -- are in their teens and, uh, uh, you know, they've got so many things on their minds, they don't want to talk to their grandma so, uh 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] You know, th- they -- I guess I -- I, you know, it's one of those things that you have to expect so, uh ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] You -- do you have children?
R:  Yeah.  Two.
L:  Two children, uh-huh.
R:  Two girls.
L:  Oh, girls, uh-huh.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I had -- I had, uh, three boys and a daughter so, uh, [SIGH] uh, you know that made a nice mix, ah, of -- and they -- they all came within tend years of each other so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so it -- it kinda makes it, you know, kinda nice when you think --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- about that.  [SIGH] Um.  Are your children still home with you or ...?
R:  Yeah.  They're seven and nine.
L:  Oh, I see, oh yeah, they -- well -- [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [LAUGH] you've got -- you've got the -- the -- the difficult years coming up, uh --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- when they come -- come into their teens, uh --
R:  Mm. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- yeah, that's, uh ...
R:  Oh   [PAUSE] [MN]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That'll be fun! 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- well, of course yeah --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [LAUGH] -- it -- it -- it's, uh, really an exciting experience [SIGH] no matter w- w- what -- what age they are, I mean, they're -- you -- you really can't foretell what's going to happen, uh, uh 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- [MN] [SIGH] the kids, I mean, they -- they go all of different ways and -- and -- and it -- it -- it's what makes life exciting I think --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- at that age, yeah, oh it really does, uh-huh.
R:  Yes. [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] Uh, well I guess we should maybe get back to movies but, uh --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I -- [LAUGH] I ...
R:  [LAUGH] Ah! Have you seen any movies in the theater lately?
L:  [SIGH] Oh gosh, I can't even -- you know I think the last movie that I saw at a theater was, uh, the -- something about the Cider House Rules -- do you recall that -- that film?
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  Ah well, uh, that -- that was the last one I saw and that was [NOISE] -- I'd bet that was a couple of years ago.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I just -- I just -- [SIGH] if the -- the theaters had to depend on me to [SIGH] -- to make it, they'd all be closed, uh --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I just, uh -- I -- I used to go --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- quite often when I was, you know, younger but, like I say, it's just so much more convenient to -- to stop off at the video store and pick up a few things --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  -- and -- and you can keep them for a few days, and in fact I'm even considering joining that, uh -- uh, club, uh -- that net switch, you know that --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you probably read about on -- on the t- -- on the -- on the, uh, computer? --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- Where they mail them to you and you don't have to worry about [SIGH] late fees and it's really quite expensive.  You can keep get keep getting them back and forth and it -- it sounds really convenient, so I --
R:  Yeah, it does. [NOISE]
L:  -- I think I'm going to look into that.  Uh, I haven't done it yet but, uh, you know, it -- it does -- it does sound, uh, pretty interesting.
R:  Yeah, it sounds really good.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [PAUSE] It's a lot more convenient.
L:  Well that -- that's for sure.  It is really quite convenient, uh-huh.
R:  Yes.  [SIGH] Comes right to your door! [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well that's it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- yeah, uh-huh.  And I -- I guess you -- you get to -- you know, they've got a huge selection to choose from --
R:  Yeah. [MN] 
L:  -- and I guess the turnaround period is -- is pretty quick [SIGH] so, um, you know, you get them when you need them and you can watch --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- them at your leisure and -- and uh, keep, you know, send them back when you're through --
R:  Yeah!
L:  -- and then you've got another -- I think, and the limit is free if I recall.  Ah, you -- so having that -- that on had is -- you know, sounds more than sufficient, uh 
R:  Uh-huh. [PAUSE] Yeah! [PAUSE] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  How many -- how many of these calls have you made?
R:  Um 
L:  Or have you received or ...?
R:  I've received some, um, [NOISE] the first time they were doing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the -- uh, the study and then, uh, this is the first one I've made --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, since they started it again.
L:  [SIGH] Oh -- oh they did this once before?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh I see, I -- yeah, I wasn't aware of that.  A friend [SIGH] mentioned it to me -- again a [MN] -- a computer friend -- and -- and mentioned it to me so I called and got the information [SIGH] and found it sounded interesting so, this is the second call that I've had.  And I understand that there's a limit of three calls to make --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and then -- then you're through.  But, uh -- uh, it -- it just, uh -- like I say it's just interesting to f- find out what the topics are and -- except for tonight, I didn't think this one was so hot. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Ah [LAUGH] well!
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  It's interesting to talk to people, you know, different places and 
L:  Well, [MN] that -- that's it yeah.  [SIGH] Um, uh -- uh I've just talked with uh -- uh women so far [SIGH] but I understand there are men in the study als- ...
