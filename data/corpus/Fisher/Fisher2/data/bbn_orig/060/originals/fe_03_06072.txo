L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  My name's Lisa.
R:  Hi, I'm Yolanda.
L:  Hi.  Okay our topic is computing.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Good -- this is the first time I've ever done this.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Me too.
L:  [LAUGH] Um, do you play computer games?
R:  I'm playing one now.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Are you really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Are you addicted?  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH] Wh- what are you playing?
R:  It's called Alcamein[?] -- Alcamix[?].
L:  I've never heard of it.
R:  It's really cool.
L:  Really.  I think solitaire is about all I do.
R:  That's my brother.  He does that all the time.
L:  Yeah, I know, I -- I do that when I'm bored or if I'm on hold and I'm sitting by my computer, I'll --  
R:  Um, we get -- 
L:  -- I'll just -- 
R:  -- addicted.
L:  Yeah, ah, yeah.  You know -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I probably have that potential, but I'm not.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, okay, I've said about all I have to say about computing and how are we going to make this last ten minutes?
R:  I have no idea.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Do you -- do you know what the point of this whole thing is?
R:  For the calls?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I guess they're doing research and the way people talk about different things.
L:  Okay.
R:  I don't know.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Mm, okay, so explain to me your game.  That should take up some time.
R:  Well, it's got a bunch of shapes [NOISE] and what you do is you line them all up, but they have to match either color or shape.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And when you're -- 
L:  Is it like one of those things that used to be in a plastic thing and you'd shove it around till you got the design or whatever within the frame?
R:  Ah, no -- 
L:  Do you know what I'm talking about?
R:  No.  It's, um, ah, let me see, it's a strategy game.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- oh, gosh, it's hard to explain.  It's a good game though.  Um --
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- [MN] [NOISE] kind of like, um, [NOISE] how could I explain it?  Um -- 
L:  [NOISE] What's it -- how do you win?  Is it timed?  [NOISE] -- 
R:  Ah, yeah.  Yeah [NOISE] it is timed.  Um, you win by -- well actually you move up levels and you win when you've completed all of the levels and you haven't gotten stuck anywhere 'cause you basically you start off in the middle.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then they give you a different shape and you have to work around the middle square and then you have to, you know, l- line up each color and [NOISE] -- oh, it just killed me.
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, it -- so, what is it, a timed thing until you make your next move without [inaudible] by getting stuck, or you just can't make anymore? 
R:  Yeah, okay, so the object of the game is to turn the whole board into -- into gold by placing magic runes and every -- on every square.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Placing the runes first -- placing the first rune next to the, you know, the grey stone and that's the, you know, the middle where you start off as the grey s- -- grey stone.  Each rune must be placed next to another that's already on the board.  In addition it must match the rune in either color or shape or both.
L:  Oh.  Okay, so this -- can this [inaudible] game take a really long time?  Could you be stuck at the computer unable to move 'cause you're s- -- can't leave the game because you'll die if you stop?
R:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  You can't just walk aw- -- you can't just stop and go, "Okay, I've had enough.  I'll come back to this".  You have to keep going.
R:  Well, you could stop.  You could -- 
L:  But you would -- but you'd die.
R:  -- put it on a hold like -- 
L:  Oh, you can put -- 
R:  But -- 
L:  -- it on hold?
R:  But, you can't put it on hold very long.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] So, it's -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's kind of lethal.
L:  That would be a scary one to get addicted to.  That really does, ah, put a lot of pressure on you.
R:  Yeah, it's kind of like, ah, have you ever played like, um, Collapse?
L:  Mm mm.
R:  Or, ah, Poppet[?]?
L:  Mm mm.
R:  No.  Um -- 
L:   No.
R:  -- it's kind of like those games.  Those games are like, um, if you are -- you have to pop so many, you know, in a straight line that, you know, s- same color or whatever.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they're balloons.  Then you can, you know, move to your next level and -- 
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- it -- it's kind of weird, but it's really addicting.
L:  Okay, yeah, I -- I [several inaudible words] happen to walk away or I would sit and play until I'm kind of bleary.
R:  Yeah, that's pretty much what I do.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean, I just sit here and zone out on the thing.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, that must mean you have time at home.  That's nice.
R:  What's that?
L:  That must mean you have some time at home.  That's nice.
R:  I stay home with the kids.
L:  Yeah.  I do too.  [NOISE] I just, ah, try to stay away from my computer.  [LAUGH] [NOISE] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] How old are your kids?  [NOISE] -- 
R:  Three and four.
L:  [NOISE] Three and four?  [NOISE] -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] Wait, it sounds like there's a plane landing in my yard at the moment.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  Right.  I hear it.
L:  [NOISE] Sorry, I can't hear anything.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] So, how did you hear about this marketing thing?  [NOISE] -- 
R:  On, um -- I j- -- I don't know, I was just -- got an email from it.  I think I went to go on and, um, find out how to promote my own business.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it just, I guess, in -- in process I signed up for [LAUGH] this.  Didn't really realise it until they called me and I was like, "Oh, yeah, I could do that.  That's not a problem" -- 
L:  Well -- well, when I heard that, um, [MN] -- well, I didn't hear, when I was reading about it, it made it sound like, um, y- -- that -- you know, there was only so many calls you do and that was it.  It wasn't like an on -- on going -- 
R:  Yeah, that's what I thought too, until they called.
L:  What I mean, it's like I don't think we'll be called forever until we say we don't want to do it any -- anymore.  I think it's like a ten --  
R:  Yeah -- 
L:  -- um -- 
R:  -- ten -- ten call limit thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yes, that's what I was thinking too.
L:  Yeah, I think that was -- that was the deal.  So, um, yeah, ten minutes doesn't sound that long until you're actually doing it.  I wonder if they -- 
R:  They have to -- 
L:  -- listen to the recorded calls and go, "You know, these guys aren't really that good.  I don't think we'll call them [LAUGH] again".
R:  [LAUGH] I guess they're just, um, pretty much, um, just record it to find out how people re- -- you know, interact with each other, talking about cert- certain types of topics I guess.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  Which is cool.
L:  [NOISE] Ah, where -- where do you live?  [NOISE] -- 
R:  I'm in Maryland.
L:  [NOISE] Maryland, okay, I'm in California.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  Ah, my aunt -- my fiancee's aunt lives in California.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Where?
R:  In, um, gosh, I don't even remember now.  Um -- 
L:  You have -- you haven't been out to visit?
R:  No.  Can't afford it -- 
L:  I -- 
R:  -- it's way expensive there.
L:  I know.  I know, it really is.  Ridiculous.  But, I've never made it to Maryland either.
R:  It's cool.  It's cheap.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  New York's the best though.
L:  Yeah.  I haven't even gone to New York and I always -- that's on my list of things to do.
R:  Oh, I lived there.  I was born and raised in New York.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well.
R:  Moved here to, ah, kind of get away from the fast life.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Time to settle down.  Okay, we're supposed to be talking about games.
L:  Oh, you know what -- 
R:  Man -- 
L:  Okay, the only other one I've done is Free Cell.  Have you s- -- 
R:  Free Cell.
L:  -- have you ever seen that one?
R:  No.
L:  It's like a form of Solitaire but it has, um, you can just kind of do other little tricky things with it.  But, you have to be -- it's -- it's kind of, um, you have to be kind of tricky.  It's -- it's sort of fun.  It's one of those ones that's loaded on your computer when you -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- buy it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, if you go to games, it's usually -- 
R:  Oh, yeah, I -- I've seen it there, I just never tried it before.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's -- that's actually -- that's ac- actually a kind of a fun one once you get the hang of how to do it.  So, you know, you and your, um, [MN] your addiction, I think you should try -- 
R:  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  -- that one as in a -- [LAUGH] as a nice change of pace.  [LAUGH] That's like the extent of my, um, computer games.  They've picked a topic I really don't do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, um -- 
R:  When I play, I play Super Collapse and Super Collapse Two.
L:  [LAUGH] Do your -- 
R:  And -- 
L:  -- do your kids play?
R:  Yeah, we play, um, Noggin.
L:  I haven't heard that one either.
R:  It's noggin dot com with Dora[?] the Explorer.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  We play those games.
L:  Oh, okay.  My daughter would probably --
R:  [NOISE] -- 
L:  -- like that.  She's six.
R:  Yeah, she'd probably get into it.  It's -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, they -- they actually let them draw pictures on there and you can print them out and they can keep them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, they do numbers, games, um, match -- color matching games, um, and they got different things for different age groups.  But --  
L:  Yeah, I have -- I have nine year old twins.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And then a six year old.  So, yeah, is it N.O.G.I.N.?
R:  Mhm.  No, N.O.G.G.I.N.
L:  Okay.  Oh, maybe I will try that one and see -- 
R:  Oh, [several inaudible words] -- 
L:  -- 'cause they -- 'cause they do enjoy doing that.
R:  Yeah, they -- my daughter loves it, and she's three.  And like I said, they do the -- in different pictures and she can color 'em and -- and print 'em out and, you know, all different types of stuff.  Then they have the -- the Sesame Street characters, like Burt and Ernie and all them. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, they're the ones that do like the -- the sock match game.  You've got to match the colors and the shapes on the sock with, you know, with -- with each other and -- 
L:  Right.
R:  It's pretty cool.
L:  Well, okay, I'll -- I'll have to try that one.
