L:  Hello.
R:  [NOISE] Hi. [NOISE]
L:  Hi, this is --
R:  [NOISE] Hello. [NOISE]
L:  Ah.  Hello?
R:  Yeah, hi. [NOISE] 
L:  Hi, this is Barbara in Texas.
R:  Oh hi.  My name's Julie.  I'm from Philadelphia.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So they want us to talk about movies?
R:  Um, yeah [MN].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I ca- -- I was just thinking I can't remember the last movie I actually saw in a movie theater. [MN]
L:  Yeah, I -- you know, we -- well we went today but we normally only go to the dollar fifty movies --
R:  Th- --
L:  -- because they're --
R:  There's dollar fifty movies in Texas, wow!
L:  Oh, yeah!  Do you have 'em up there?
R:  No, we have the cheapest movie theater is like six fifty or seven dollars.
L:  Oh my God!
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [MN] Yeah we have, um, the dollar fifty it's great because we have -- well we have just one chain down here, [SIGH] and they run a huge theater --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- where they charge like, you know, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- seven dollars --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and then they a dollar fifty movie --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- where everything moves after a couple of months.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, most of us just wait until it gets to the dollar fifty --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- so that we're not paying like really outrageous rates. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, [SIGH] but yeah if we didn't have the dollar fifty I don't think we'd go at all.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Odd!  So do you just rent movies at home then?
R:  Um, uh, yeah I make to the theater usually once in a while, I usually rent like mov- -- rent movies or rent DVDs or just see whatever is on TV or whatever is on HBO or sho- Show Time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] or things like that.  I think lately I've even switched to public [SIGH] -- public channels, I saw Pretty Woman [NOISE] a few days ago that was on TV.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Not bad.  And what did you see today?
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] we went -- [SIGH] we have a little boy who's four so we took him to see the P- -- the Piglet movie.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's like a Whinny the Pooh. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It was actually pretty good, you know, it was -- it was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- pretty good.  The, um -- the quality of the film at the dollar fifty is -- is probably --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a little bit less --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- 'cause I think they get some of the, um [LIPSMACK]--
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the reels that are a little bit damaged.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But, you know, it was fine and it was only like an hour --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and ten minutes --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and he loved it, so   But yeah, we went to see Piglet and Whinny the Pooh and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that was about it. [LAUGH]  But otherwise --
R:  [MN]


L:  we -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- normally rent like from Hollywood Video or Blockbuster.
R:  How far, um -- I guess how much earlier do the movies come out in the dollar fifty theater before they [NOISE] get into the Blockbuster?
L:  [MN] Um [SIGH] let's see --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they -- let's see, they start at the regular theater, probably about two months later they're at the dollar fifty, [SIGH] so I would say [SIGH] maybe about four months ahead of the, um, [LIPSMACK] Blockbuster.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  Yeah, yeah.  It's -- it depends on your part of the country.  Um, when we lived in Nebraska, they also had a dollar fifty movie, but it would take a good six months for the movies to show up there.  And that would be at the same [NOISE] time that they were coming to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Blockbuster too.
R:  So is Blockbuster almost going out of business there 'cause it wouldn't make sense at that point unless there's more than two people to go to a Blockbuster --
L:  [MN] I know [NOISE] --
R:  --'cause Blockbusters are like four dollars.
L:  [NOISE] I know, I know. [LAUGH]  The rental costs, I mean they've really gone up too. [LIPSMACK]  But, um, yeah, I mean, the dollar fifty's are pretty popular, you know, 'cause they're cheap and at the theater and, you know, if you take three people like we did then it's, um, [LIPSMACK] four fifty for three people.
R:  Yeah, it's -- [MN]
L:  And it's --
R:  Yeah, I -- see, we never have that, I think is that on the west coast?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] Wow. [NOISE]
L:  Now, um, you're in Philadelphia -- I'm --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- kind of surprised they don't have anything like a discount movie --
R:  N --
L:  -- theater or --
R:  --no.
L:  -- anything.
R:  The only discounts we get -- I'm actually a student, so the only dis- discounts we get are student discounts and even then we never see cheaper than five fifty.
L:  Oh!
R:  Adult tickets at the movie theater I go to are eight, eight fifty.
L:  Oh my god! [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  And even then it's totally packed and most movies are always sold out.
L:  Jeez! [LAUGH]
R:  I- --
L:  Wow!  [NOISE]
R:  Is popcorn and snacks also cheaper at the dollar fifty theaters? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah they are -- they are, plus they give you refills; they give you free refills.
R:  [NOISE] [PAUSE] [MN] W- wow! [NOISE]
L:  So on y- -- like if you buy -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you have to buy the large --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but if you buy a large popcorn and a  -- or a large drink --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they'll refill it for free.
R:  Well, yeah [MN] and we have free refills too but except a large soda will cost you four to five dollars.
L:  Ooh!  No it's not quite that [LAUGH] much here. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Not quite that much, I mean it's kind of still expensive but it's not -- it's not too bad.  [LIPSMACK] But, yeah I don't think we could survive without the dollar fifty, there -- I don't think there's any way [SIGH].  And then during the week, like if you go Monday through Friday, and you go to the first showing of the day, then it's only a dollar. [MN]
R:  Wouldn't that be like -- is that eleven o'clock in the morning then?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  They're usually pretty early but, you know, if you're off or, you know, you don't have anything to do, [MN] it -- it --
R:  Do a lot of people go to those?
L:  Yeah [LAUGH] actually, especially in the summertime because the kids are out of school, and so they go like during the week and they'll go to like the eleven o'clock or the noon showing and then it's only a dollar, you know, per person.
R:  Yeah that -- wow! [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  So, I know, and they show, um -- it's a pretty big theater, they probably have about twelve movies showing at a- at one time.
R:  And is it only one theater like in the area like that, or ?
L:  Well, there's one in our -- in our town and then, um, I live all --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the way at the bottom of Texas, like near Brownsville.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And there's one in Brownsville and then there's one in our town, um, Harlingden, but [SIGH] yeah, they're -- they're kinda scattered around.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But I don't think people -- you know, there's a lot of poverty down here, and I don't think they would make much money --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if they didn't have a dollar fifty theater too, 'cause most people can't afford, you know, the regular theater every single week. [NOISE] [PAUSE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So 
R:  [NOISE] That's probably -- that's probably why, um, like in Philadelphia and New York or any other cities like on the east coast you won't find that, [NOISE] 'cause there's no such -- there's not really that level of poverty --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and even people like from the -- actually from the -- the poorer areas go into the major[?] areas for the movie theater and you --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- see that quite --
L:  Right.
R:  -- often.
L:  Well that's too bad 'cause, you know, when we were in college we always went to the [LAUGH] dollar fifty 'cause that's all we could afford.  [MN] You know, 'cause like you said, even with a student discount you don't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's still -- it's still expensive.
R:  Yeah, I think that's a -- a lot of people only go like once a month or when some movie comes out that they really wanna see in -- especially in the theater.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Otherwise, unless [several inaudible words] don't remember it after they see the first two commercials and then they wait around till it gets out into a Blockbuster, or even gets out on to, like, an HBO or show time or something. [NOISE]
L:  Right, right. [MN] And rentals aren't too bad --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, as long as, like you said, you have at least a couple of people watching it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- then they're not too bad, but for one person they're kind of pricey at four dollars.
R:  Well, I mean with the one fifty theater it's even pricey for two people.
L:  Yeah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH] I know. [LAUGH]  It is, it is.
R:  [MN] Is Blockbuster and like Hollywood Videos prices lower there?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um 
R:  [NOISE] Than --
L:  Blockbuster; it's about four dollars for rental, for new release rentals down here.  Hollywood is about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- two -- I think it's about two fifty.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, so they're not too bad.  And Hollywood also has a lot of, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for kids they have a lot of free rentals, you know like, they'll have the Whinny the Pooh or Dr Seuss or something that's totally free and you can keep it for a few days --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and then bring it back.
R:  [NOISE] Really? For f- --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  Totally for free? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, yeah, but they're just for little --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, they're just for little kids --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they're just kinda entertaining, thirty minute type videos --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but at least you don't have to pay for 'em. [SIGH]
R:  Well, here -- I think everything here --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is -- is -- you have to pay for everything unless you go to the -- the free library in Philadelphia th- they would have actually movies for free you could get.  [SIGH] And they wouldn't have any kind of new releases but they would have movies that are older, they're maybe like two, three years.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] So and then that -- that way you could get movies for free.  But that's only like downtown Philadelphia or something but I live forty minutes away.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  Not worth it to go forty minutes to -- like, [LAUGH] to get a free movie.
L:  Jeez! [LAUGH] Yeah --
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]
L:  -- it is. [LAUGH]
R:  It think sometimes like just even when I'm not home I'll just tape movies on the VCR.
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  The movies that are on TV and then when I get around to it I'll watch it. [NOISE]
L:  Well, you have HBO you said?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, and Show Time and all those channels. [NOISE]
L:  So you can -- you can tape off of there, right?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah exactly. [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] But they play a lot of the same movies over and over again don't they?
R:  Yeah.  Each month they have like three or four movies that come out and they -- and then they repeat themselves over and over again.
L:  Okay, yeah.  See we don't have cable at all.  Um  well we did, but [SIGH] you know, the cost, it was like really expensive so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we just went ahead and dropped it, so now we have, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  --PBS and, like two other stations [LAUGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and that's like, it.  So --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in order to see anything we pretty much have to go out --
R:  [NOISE] [PAUSE]
L:  But, it's not bad, you know.
R:  Well, with -- with one fifty movie theaters it's -- it's not that bad to go out any more. [LAUGH]
L:  No, no.
R:  But --
L:  Well, you know, it's cheap and like right acr- -- it's really cool because right across the street from the dollar fifty theater [SIGH] is, um, an all you can eat pizza place where it's three dollars and fifty cents for all you can [NOISE] eat.
R:  Any time of day?
L:  Yep, yep. [LAUGH]  And they do -- they are packed all the time.  And it's all you can eat pizza [NOISE] and sal- -- a salad bar --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and a dessert bar for --
R:  Wow!
L:  --three fifty.  Yep. [NOISE]
R:  You know I think -- I think Pizza Hut is the only place that has that around here and even then it's like seven or eight dollars for the all you can eat 'specially 'round --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- dinnertime. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  I mean that -- that's what I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- would expect, for a price, I don't know how they get away with doing it so cheap. [SIGH]
R:  I think if there's a lot of people with kids and kids get the all you can eat maybe and then they only eat like one slice or something.
L:  Right, [LAUGH] right.
R:  Plus some general salad is cheap, I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  --you know, lettuce -- the ingredients are cheap and if you make it in huge quantities then it doesn't really matter much.
L:  Yeah, and for kids, you know, they only -- they charge like two fifty for kids.
R:  Oh.  Wow!
L:  So it -- yeah, the three fifty's for adults and then kids over age, I think four, are two fifty.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And they just do all you can eat and then on Friday nights [NOISE] they set up a p- -- a [LIPSMACK] cotton candy machine, and that's free too.  [LAUGH] They give away cotton candy to all the kids.  It's just really cute but, yeah, it's right across from the dollar fifty --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so if you do the movie --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and then dinner you have a really cheap -- cheap evening.
R:  [NOISE] Wow, that makes me wanna move to Texas! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah here in the evening, um, [MN] a dinner and a movie is going to be about twenty five to thirty dollars per person.
L:  Y- -- right, right.  Oh, I believe it.
R:  [MN]
L:  I believe it.
R:  [MN] Yeah, and there's no kind of all you can eat.  But any kind of all -- all you can eat places, cheapest even Chinese place, there's a lot of Chinese all you can eat places ev- -- up here, but even that is going to be ten dollars at the cheapest -- [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] Wow!
R:  -- like during dinnertime.
L:  Wow!  Now does Pennsylvania -- they have a state income tax too, don't they.
R:  Yes. 
L:  Oh -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- wow!
R:  [LAUGH] [MN] I real- -- I think a pretty high one actually 'cause -- I think probably like five percent.
L:  Oh?
R:  Four and a half to five percent.
L:  Wow!  So do you go to school there?
R:  Um, yeah I go to the University of Pennsylvania.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  As far as movies -- well you probably don't have that much time, do-
