L:  Kimberley?
R:  [MN] Hi, I'm Elaine. [NOISE] [PAUSE] 
L:  [MN] So are we supposed to start and just talk about movies then?
R:  [MN] I guess!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well I enjoy going -- I, like, enjoy going to the movies and watching movies at home.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  It's a nice treat sometimes, you know --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- to go out.
R:  Yes, it is.  I mean I do enjoy that too, uh, to be honest with you I think the last one I saw [SIGH] actually in the theater was, oh, I think it was Beauty and the Beast or Pocahontas or -- [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- something like that with my daughter and I mean that was even a few years ago.  I -- we -- there just -- [MN] don't seem to get the time any more to really, you know, to go out to the movies and that --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- but we do, um, we do watch 'em a good bit at home.  We -- we just have like some [SIGH] -- mostly like VHS movies but, you know, but -- but we rent those and, [SIGH] uh, [SIGH] have kind of a little [NOISE] collection of our own and [SIGH] -- and that's something we enjoy. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, heck yeah.  You know, I mean, we don't get out much either.  I mean, we get out to go --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to the movies, you know, it's something we just don't think of doing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, because of cost for one thing, you know.
R:  Right. [NOISE] 
L:  You know, when you've got a family, you know, it can be pretty expensive [LAUGH] you know, --
R:  I -- I know --
L:  -- when it's all --
R:  -- exactly --
L:  --said and done. [LAUGH]
R:  --what you mean. [MN]
L:  You know?  So we do the exact same thing --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but it is a nice treat when you do go out.
R:  Oh, definitely, yeah.  It's something I've always liked to do. [MN] 
L:  Yeah, I enjoy it myself --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know.  I mean, but granted we do have our large collection of, you know, our own movies and stuff like that and, you know.
R:  Yeah, we -- we have pretty many too.  Do you have, uh -- do you have children then, or ?
L:  Yes.
R:  How many children do you have?
L:  Two.
R:  Two?  That's what I have too.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  One's, uh, [SIGH] a daughter that's fifteen and a son, six.
L:  Well, we've got two boys, um, one is, um, eighteen, the other one's twenty, so 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So I do know exactly what you're talking about, you know!
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, the kids --
L:  They enjoy going to the movies more so [MN] we go out the whole entire family, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it'd be very cost --
R:  That's kind of hard to do, any more --
L:  Oh, heck yeah, --
R:  -- but, uh  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- definitely. [LAUGH] 
R:  It's [MN] -- it's even it for us -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I mean, sometimes we'll still take maybe like the little one yet, you know --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- but, he likes his tapes and everything, y- you know, that he calls them --
L:  Oh, heck, yeah.
R:  -- pretty much too and --
L:  Because that's good entertainment --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for them, you know, --
R:  -- and --
L:  -- you can sit 'em in front --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of the TV and they enjoy that for, you know 
R:  Yeah.  And we have --
L:  They can watch that one --
R:  -- kind of a c- --
L:  -- over and over. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  We have kind of a collection of -- of Disney ones and -- [SIGH] 
L:  Oh, heck yeah.  I enjoy sort of watching those myself --
R:  Oh, well --
L:  -- you know.
R:  -- I do too.  I've watched them w- with the first one and then --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- a lot, uh, she had some of them so kind of, uh, we had a lot of them, you know, when the second one came along.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I even enjoy them now, you know --
R:  Yeah!
L:  -- and they're older, you know.
R:  Oh, yeah. s- --
L:  -- I'm the only one, you know.
R:  Oh yeah, they're  [NOISE]--
L:  It's like, "I wanna watch this"! [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Oh, yeah, they're great.  I mean, I remember watching that stuff -- stuff when I was a kid! [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Oh, yeah and that's what makes it a nice about, you know, being able to watch it from your home, you know, 'cause that way you over  [MN] and over it again.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  You always catch things you didn't see before --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the first time you watched it.
R:  Oh exactly!  I -- that's what -- that's what I think so neat about watching them.  You know, like that, to actually have them at home.
L:  Oh, yeah!
R:  [SIGH] Because there's been times, I mean -- [SIGH] I mean renting okay but the only thing is if -- if -- if something comes up and you don't get a chance to get them back then I hate having to pay [LAUGH] late fees and --
L:  Exactly, or you --
R:  -- you know --
L:  -- get a distraction. [NOISE]
R:  -- it seems so ridiculous or --
L:  Exact --
R:  Oh, I'm sorry, go ahead.
L:  --you [MN] get distracted while you're watching it, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and -- and then you g- -- walk --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- away from it and then everyone else in the family's already watched it and finished watching it, you know.
R:  Mhm.  Exactly.  Yes I know what you mean. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Happens all too terribly much in my household sometimes.
R:  Oh, yeah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for me to actually sit down and really watch one, uninterrupted, is very late at night or -- [LAUGH] 
L:  Exact- [LAUGH] --
R:  -- that's about it, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it's late at night, you're right.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I bet.  With two little ones, I mean you've got a little one it sounds like, so yeah. I bet so.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Well, he's -- he's six but yeah, he's still, [MN] like I said he's -- oh, he's a lot of fun though, but --
L:  Oh definitely. [NOISE]
R:  And he watches like, a lot of them and everything, you know, we watch together and stuff, but -- [SIGH] but he likes the Disney ones and -- and he's into Scooby Doo --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And -- and he's into, um -- you might even remember these with your sons, I know I -- remember with my daughter but, you know, they have Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles back --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- again now. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- yes!
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh yes --
R:  That's what he's --
L:  I remember it well.
R:  -- really into right now.
L:  Oh, yes I do, just like it was yesterday!
R:  Mhm!
L:  I remember the first time we bought one.  The -- the kids watched it six times in a row --
R:  Oh! [LAUGH]
L:  -- they loved it so much. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, that sounds like us, uh-huh. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Makes it kinda nice, you know.  It's -- it's -- that's what makes it nice value, they'll watch it from the home but you know -- like I said -- it's always a nice -- it's a nice given treat, if you don't do something all the time --
R:  [NOISE]
L: -- it's a treat, you know, to go out and see something.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's almost like date night or something like that --
R:  Oh yeah!
L:  -- you could call it! [LAUGH] 
R:  If you're like us those don't come around too often --
L:  [NOISE] No.
R:  -- like we were saying.  But --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- but it is fun.  That is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- one of -- something that I always did enjoy doing.  Like even, you know, back when I was in the dating scene and [LAUGH] everything.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And then, you know, and -- and when you do get a chance to do something like that.
L:  Oh, heck yeah. You know, me and my husband, you know, every once in while, he'd like, you know, he'll call me up and say, "Hey, let's have a date night tonight, let's go to the movies", and I'm like, "Hey, that's -- that sounds like a good plan". [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh yeah, definitely. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, it's good, it's good.
R:  Yeah, well what kind of movies do you like?
L:  [SIGH] I --
R:  Besides the Disney ones and all --
L:  I am actually --
R:  -- those that we --
L:  --total --
R:  --get to watch. [LAUGH] 
L:  --I am total all, you know, for girl movies, you know, I love all the sappy ones, you know, and --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I like those too.
L:  You know those are my -- always my favorite, you know, I'll be honest with you.  I mean, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- every once in a while I like to -- like last night we did go to the movies --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- last night --
R:  Oh, did you?
L:  -- as a matter of fact. We did go to the mov- --
R:  What did you see?
L:  We went [MN] to see The Matrix.
R:  Oh!  Was that good?
L:  Actually it was very good --
R:  I've heard -- 
L:  -- it was long!
R:  -- a lot about it.  I didn't even see the first one but it sounds good.
L:  Me neither.  I never saw the first one either.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So I was lost.  I'll be honest with you; if you've never seen the first one you will be lost!
R:  [NOISE] Mm.
L:  But -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- it was very good.  I mean, just, uh, the way they, you know, do the scenes and stuff like that; as far as action --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- scenes and everything.  It was very nice.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It was very -- it was a good movie.  My husband loved it, so, you know.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  If he's on the edge of his seat watching it then, ah, you know it's a good movie.
R:  Yeah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- oh definitely.  Yeah, I -- I like those kinds too -- [SIGH] but I'm kinda like you, I'm -- I kinda like the ones that my daughter always refers, um, as a chick flick.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And I'm [NOISE] I'm sure you're sons have used that term too --
L:  Exactly --
R:  -- but I -- [LAUGH]
L:  -- that's exactly what it is.
R:  Yeah!
L:  Oh, no, not again! [LAUGH] You know. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  But it's -- I -- I do like those kinds.  We, um -- she and I rented one last weekend and actually, [SIGH] um, the -- the whole family liked it pretty much.  The little -- the little guy, I wasn't sure if he was, like, as into it as he was Turtles or anything --
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  -- but -- but my husband even really liked it too and that was that, uh -- it just now came out in video la- -- I think last week.  It was that one with, uh, Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock, Two Weeks Notice.
L:  [SIGH] I've been wanting to see that!
R:  Yeah, it was like a romantic comedy type -- kinda thing, it -- it was excellent and I really liked that one.
L:  See, those are kind -- my kind of movies, you know --
R:  Yeah, I love --
L:  -- like the [MN] --
R:  -- those kinds too.
L:  You know, the Jennifer, um, whatever -- J. Lo or whatever she --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- whatever her name -- Jennifer Lopez --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or whatever.  I love all those movies, you know, and   You know I just love all the little sappy ones, I guess you could say, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I used to love watching the old ones, you know.
R:  [NOISE] That's me too.
L:  I mean that, like is better than watching, you know -- [PAUSE] Step Mom and you watch, you know, the older -- not the old ones but I mean, you know --
R:  But some of the older ones -- I mean not that they're that old, but just like, you know, in the last few years or something, I -- I tend to like a lot [LAUGH] of them better too.
L:  [MN] Me too!
R:  I don-  -- I don't know why but [LAUGH] 
L:  Because, you know, what?  A lot of times you watch some movies nowadays and it's just, you know, it's just a little bit over the b- -- over the edge, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know.  What can we say!  What can we do!
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  You just gotta watch 'em! [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh yeah, this is true.  Well I think one of my absolute favorite ones, I don't know if you're into this or not but, uh, back when the original one came out [SIGH] I was really into the Star Wars ones.
L:  Oh yes, I really do enjoy those too, those are really nice.  I really do enjoy that.  I think they have another one coming out pretty soon though.
R:  [SIGH] I don't know.  Um, they should be -- they're probably working on one at least.  I'm not sure how soon it's coming out.
L:  Well what about the Lord of the Rings?  I really enjoyed that one --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- too though.
R:  That one --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- sounds good.  I've never seen any of those, but --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- I do like --
L:  [NOISE] They're good. 
R:  -- that kind of thing so I probably would. [MN] 
L:  [SIGH] I wouldn't -- I didn't think I was [MN] -- didn't know much about it until my husband took me to see the first one.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's just like, what, I have to wait till an- -- I have to wait another year before I could see the next one?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  What are you talking about? [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's so good! [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN] I know, that -- that's what kills you.  There's always an ending you're just like dying to see. [NOISE] 
L:  Exactly!
R:  You know, that's the way I was with Star Wars, especially, [SIGH] um, when --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- th- this -- this last grouping, you know, I mean if you're familiar with it -- I mean the first three you really had no idea what was hap- -- gonna happen.
L:  No, right.
R:  And I mean, now, with the fir- -- you know, now with these you kind of know a little bit more what to hap- -- what's going to happen and they're not quite as, uh, exciting that way but I -- I still really liked them.  It was still neat to, you know, see how all of it [NOISE] --
L:  Well they did the --
R:  -- wandered in --
L:  -- cinematograph- --
R:  -- and turned out and --
L:  [SIGH] Oh, I know, it was just --
R:  -- it was still exciting just to see what was going to happen. [NOISE] 
L:  Well the cinematography is very good --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- too, you --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- know what I mean, it's just like, "Wow, you know, how did they get to do all that stuff to make it look so real".  You know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  --what I mean?
R:  Mhm.  Definitely.
L:  So I really do enjoy the Star Wars ones too.  I really do.  [LAUGH] They're just so darned cute! [LAUGH]
R:  Oh yes, they are! [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH] But I do.  I mean, I -- I have to say I like those, I like the sappy ones, you know, the chick flick ones.  I just don't like the, you know, the real action, action ones, you know?
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  As a lot of violence, that's -- 
R:  But --
L:  -- what I mean. [NOISE]
R:  -- not -- not if [NOISE] they real, real violent, no.  I -- I don't -- I don't fit into that either.  But, uh, I mean, some of the -- and I'm trying to think of an example; some that are like a lot action but they have like other stuff in with them and it's not like real gory or, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- something like that I like but   They kinda -- kinda do keep you on the edge of your seat.
L: [SIGH] Right.
R:  But --
L:  Those are good but --
R:  -- then it starts 
L:  -- the -- the ones where there's like too much blood and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- all that stuff --
R:  And some --
L:  -- it's like ugh, ugh!
R:  -- of them any more are just [MN] --
L:  Way over.
R:  -- awful, yeah.
L:  You know, and my husband's like, "Oh that's a great movie!" and I'm like, "Why?"
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  My husband doesn't even get into them although he'll probably --
L:  You're lucky!
R:  -- [SIGH] he has more of a tolerance I think than I do, but it's just -- I mean he'll watch them, he might not be real [several inaudible words] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- but he'll watch 'em or something, you know, but --
L:  [MN] [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I just -- [SIGH] I don't know.  And to me it just kind of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, it wouldn't have to be that.  Most of the time -- otherwise even they're a pretty good movie.  It's just there's some stuff that I would just as soon I wouldn't have to see, you know. [LAUGH] 
L:  Exactly!  Absolutely.  You know, it's like okay --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I'm -- you know, if I get bored with it -- it's the nice thing about it --
R:  [NOISE]
L: -- if you don't like it while you're --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- watching at home you can walk away and do something else.
R:  [MN] Exactly! --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]   
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [LAUGH] You can always surf -- channel surfing --
L:  Exactly!
R:  -- or something -- 
L:  Exactly!
R:  -- or else you could --
