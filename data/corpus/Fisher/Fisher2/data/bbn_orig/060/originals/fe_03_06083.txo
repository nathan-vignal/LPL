L:  [NOISE] Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Yes, this is Kathy.
R:  Hi, this is Linda and I live in [inaudible], Minnesota.
L:  Hi Linda.  I live in Kansas City, Missouri.
R:  Missouri.  Where?
L:  In -- it's a small suburb right outside [NOISE] of Kansas City named Lee Summit.
R:  Oh.  Well, do you play computer games?
L:  Ah, we play a lot of computer games.  We only play educational computer games though, very little, um, games for fun -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- on the computer.
R:  Do you have a -- 
L:  Do you?
R:  Do you have a family that plays -- children that play computer games?
L:  Yes, I have three children.
R:  Oh.  Well, my children are grown up so anything I play on the computer would just be me.
L:  Oh.  How often do you play on the computer?
R:  Well, I'm usually on my computer every day but I'm not necessarily playing games.  I do some, ah, things that, ah, you can -- you can earn money or points towards, ah, buying a card to Pizza Hut or something like that.
L:  Yeah, well that sounds like fun.
R:  But, some of them are -- I think I played a couple called I Win and I Won and those allow me to build points and then I can buy things with my points.  So, yeah, I guess those are games. 
L:  Huh.
R:  I haven't really played too much like, um, Solitaire or anything like that.  I get bored pretty easily with that.  In fact -- 
L:  I -- 
R:  -- 'cause I, ah, at one time was playing some games where you're clicking very, very fast. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I wound up, ah, at the doctors with [several inaudible words] swollen hands that I couldn't -- 
L:  Carpel tunnel?
R:  Well, I don't know.  They gave me a shot and it hasn't been bad since.  But, then I haven't played that game since either.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Isn't that funny.  Ah -- 
R:  'Cause, um -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I'm a -- are you playing right now?
L:  Well, I just -- I thought I would have to, ah, when the phone call came in 'cause this is my first time, so I thought I better hop on the computer in case -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I did, so -- 
R:  This is my second time.
L:  I'm sorry?  Oh, it is.
R:  Yeah.
L:  What was your first topic about?
R:  Oh, if, um, I had the choice between my best -- talking to my best friend or having a million dollars.
L:  Really.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Huh.
R:  And I talked to an older lady, sixty eight years' old.
L:  Really.
R:  But, I shouldn't say older because, um, ah, she was seventy eight.  I'm sixty one.
L:  Are you really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And how many children do you have?
R:  I have three girls but I -- I'm a great grandma.
L:  Well, good for you.  [NOISE] 
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, I have [NOISE] three boys.
R:  Oh.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But, my children play more, um -- 
R:  Educational --
L:  Well, it -- 
R:  -- or [inaudible].
L:  Huh?
R:  Educational.
L:  Educational on the computer.  If they play other kinds of games, now they're technology games, it's more like the X. Box or the Nintendo or they -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- in the car but I try to push them to use the computer for education so they get used to possibly doing book reports or -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- projects for the computer.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  Oh, that's good.  That's, er, probably going to be a -- they'll be ahead of some of the kids that don't have that knowledge in school.
L:  Well, I don't -- I hope so.  It's just kind of amazing how, um, much these kids seem to know.
R:  Well, they know more than we do in some of these push button things.
L:  It's just -- I mean, my kids right now, if they don't know their ABCs before kindergarten, they're behind.
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  So, I find we're trying to push them to play computer games 'cause I think they're going to have to do so much more on the computer.
R:  How old are they?
L:  Ah, five, seven and nine.
R:  Oh.
L:  It's, ah -- and you have three girls.  That's kind of funny isn't it?
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That you would have the three boys and I would have the three girls.  So -- 
L:  Did you want any boys?
R:  Ah, probably not, when I look back at the -- you know, but I had to learn how to -- to deal with boys because my great grand children are boys.
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  My grand -- my grand daughter is pregnant with her third boy so I'm learning about boys.
L:  [NOISE] Isn't that wild?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Huh.  Well, I'm just not a really big fan of, ah, going back to the [inaudible] we're supposed to talk, um, [NOISE] it's so many [NOISE] -- 
R:  You're not a big fan of what?
L:  [NOISE] I'm sorry?  [NOISE] -- 
R:  I'm sorry, you're not a big fan of what?
L:  Ah, of a lot of the computer games -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- because sometimes, I think, you know, I think it's bad enough that there're so many out there right now.  I think kids need to get outside a little bit more and -- 
R:  I know.
L:  -- play in the dirt and -- 
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- play with their friends versus sitting in front of a computer all day long.
R:  Yeah, they don't know even -- they've never even heard of some of the games that we used to play outside.
L:  Oh, I know.  I mean, I used to get excited 'cause there was dirt.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  And now they're just money -- and I think it -- it -- what is sad is that so many of them are not educational even, you know, I admire the games that are educational but that are fun too not -- I don't want to go [NOISE] to sit there and [inaudible] like they are in a classroom but, if they can make 'em fun that's a -- you know, just this -- yeah, sometimes I think these teachers don't teach very well anymore but, um, I think -- I admire the games for they incorporate fun and learning.
R:  Yeah, right.  Or -- 
L:  Um -- 
R:  -- behaviour.
L:  Oh, definitely.  Um -- 
R:  Being that behaviour is kind of seems like it's on the down side.
L:  I know, and I think so many parents try to be their children's friend -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- anymore that they don't -- they're not parents, so [NOISE] anyway, kind of interesting.  Do your, um, grand children play games? 
R:  Ah, my grand children do, yeah.  My grand children are all near adults.
L:  Oh, you have great grand children, right?
R:  Mm, yeah.  [MN] 
L:  What do -- 
R:  Well, I have -- 
L:  Ah, what do they play?
R:  Ah, I don't think she's gotten -- um, 'cause the oldest is three, three and a half, I don't think she's really gotten him dealing with the computer.  She's a -- a mother that reads to her kids a lot and doesn't let them watch very much TV so I don't think they're in to it yet but -- 
L:  Well, that's good.  I think -- 
R:  They will.
L:  -- that's kind of -- 
R:  They will have to know that when they go to school.
L:  Yeah.  Kind of hard to keep a child away from TV anymore these days.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I admire her for doing that 'cause sometimes, you know, they -- they just use these things as babysitters sometimes.
R:  Yeah.  Well, my daughter won't do that.  She's a strict mom.
L:  Oh, she is, huh?
R:  Yeah.  Grandma sometimes has hard time with that.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.  But, where'd she learn it from?
R:  Oh, well, I don't know.  She's kind of, ah, different from the -- the rest of the family.  She's got, ah, higher values I think and higher standards and but, oh, I guess in the long run it's going to be good.  Oh, she's in the middle of a divorce so she's got a -- a big, ah, [inaudible], ah, to -- ahead of her, you know?  But, anyway.
L:  Hm, how long were they married?
R:  Ah, ah, five years.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, ah, but -- 
L:  Ah -- 
R:  -- this new Danny [inaudible] you know, he brought a -- he's got a girlfriend so [LAUGH] --
L:  Mm.
R:  Too much free time.
L:  Oh, my, that's sad.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Didn't want to give her up, huh.
R:  Pardon?
L:  Does -- he doesn't want to give her up.
R:  No.  Well, my -- my grand daughter doesn't want him any more.  He's a gambler and a drinker and we're -- we're looking for a better one.  Not on the internet though.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  The internet, it's -- I think the internet's good for information and the whole -- the whole education thing, but I think the people -- 
R:  Yeah, it depends how you use it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Well, even in internet games, you know, if you're -- it's like anything else, anything you over do is not good and under dos is not good so [several inaudible words] road.
L:  You're right.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Absolutely right.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I don't know more -- anything more about, um, [MN] internet games to talk about.
L:  Yeah, I, um, used to be a trainer in it.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  [NOISE] And so I used to train the internet and it -- you know, it's just a huge library.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  [NOISE] And that's kind of pretty cool [NOISE] -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [NOISE] since it's, you know, you can just use it for all sorts of information --
