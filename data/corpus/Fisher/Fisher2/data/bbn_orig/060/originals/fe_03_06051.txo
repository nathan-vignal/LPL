L:  Hi, I'm Sandra.
R:  Hi, I'm Diane. [MN] [LAUGH]  
L:  Hi. [LAUGH] Where are you from?
R:  Um, I'm living [MN] about forty five minutes outside of Atlanta. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LIPSMACK] How about you?
L:  I'm in Saskatchewan in Canada.
R:  Oh wow! Okay --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- so you're f- -- way far from us. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, as far away we can and be still -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- if you're not in Mexico I guess, eh!
R:  Right, right.  [NOISE] So I guess we're supposed to talk about movie going? [LAUGH] 
L:  That's right.
R:  [LAUGH] Um, Well, I can't tell you the last time I went to a movie 'cause I have a one year old so. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh [LAUGH] okay, yeah!
R:  Yeah [NOISE] 
L:  No, we don't go to movies --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- because --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- well we live in a --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- suburb out of town --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and there's no --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- movie theater here so --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- we just don't go. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, okay.  Well that definitely makes sense. [MN] 
L:  Mhm.  What's the last -- 
R:  Well -- [MN] 
L:  -- one you saw?
R:  [MN] Go ahead, I'm sorry.
L:  What's the last movie you saw?
R:  [SIGH] Oh my goodness! [SIGH] Um   Wow! I'm trying to think, it's been like a year. Um -- 
L:  Even --
R:  What was the last movie we saw? [NOISE]
L:  -- renting at home?
R:  [MN] I'm sorry?
L:  Even renting at home?
R:  Well, yeah, we usually do, um, pay for view [NOISE] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, um, on our TV [NOISE] -- so, that's kind of the thing that we do.  So I'm trying to think what the last thing we did for pay for view was.  Oh. Big Fat Greek Wedding that --
L:  Oh that --
R:  -- was the last --
L:  -- was great.
R:  -- thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh [NOISE] did you see that?
L:  Yeah, well I'm Slavic so, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I'm not Greek but I'm Slavic so like --
R:  Okay. [NOISE] 
L:  -- that guy was my father, it was --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- just, like, my husband was just peeing himself --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- he was laughing so hard.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, right.  Right. [MN] 
L:  Yeah, yes.
R:  Y- yeah, I thought it was pretty good.  I mean, I was hoping it was going to be funnier than it was, like, I saw all the previews on TV and I thought, "Oh, this is going to be cool" [several inaudible words] so we've gotta get the movie and [SIGH] -- it was pretty funny though. [MN] 
L:  Yeah, well I think it was --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that if you can --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- relate to it in your family it was --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- hilarious.  If not it was --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- mildly amusing, so 
R:  Right.  Yeah, I have a pretty like small --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- family so it [MN] wasn't like at all [NOISE] when I got married so. [LAUGH] [MN] 
L:  Oh, o- ...
R:  And so what was the last movie you saw?
L:  The Ring.
R:  The Ring.  Oh yeah, people -- they say that one's good.
L:  It was freaky. [NOISE]
R:  It was [LAUGH] -- why [LAUGH]?
L:  It was pretty freaky.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] [PAUSE] Are you there?
L:  Yeah, I'm here, yeah, kinda [several inaudible words] --
R:  [MN] Okay -- [SIGH] what made it like, um, freaky? [MN] 
L:  'Cause you didn't know what was going to happen and it -- it --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- kind of, was going along, like it --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- was a normal horror movie --
R:  [NOISE] [MN] Oh, okay. [NOISE] 
L:  -- and -- and it kind of changed at the end --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and it was just like, ah, ah, -- well without --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you seeing it [NOISE]  you couldn't tell.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] But it was, uh, the unexpected [NOISE] happened.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Uh, the expected [NOISE] happened and then --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the unexpected happened after that.  Kinda like along the lines of The Sixth Sense, if you saw that?
R:  Oh, yeah, that was so good.
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH] Yeah, but you'd have to watch --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that five times before you could figure it out totally I guess.
R:  [NOISE] Wha- -- you know what?  Yeah, it -- it -- it did.  I think we did watch it two or three times, yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It was a good one.  [SIGH] So, um, I guess we're supposed to talk about [MN] -- well you already said why you don't go to the movies and I kinda said why I don't go. [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.
R:  I mean I would like to go more but then again it is kinda expensive, you know, it's getting like thirty bucks by the time you're done so.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] [MN] 
L:  Oh yeah, you know, easy, so 
R:  [MN] Oh yeah.
L:  What's your favorite movie of all times? [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH] Oh gosh, you've put me on the spot.  Um, [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] you know, it might sound kinda crazy, probably Ghost.
L:  Ghost?  Yeah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that was good. Yeah.
R:  Yeah that was really [NOISE] like one of those movies that just had, you know, so much emotion, y- you know that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it was just great. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  What about you? [NOISE] 
L:  Uh -- without fail -- Gone With The Wind. [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] Gone With The Wind!  Oh wow! Oldie --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- but goodie I guess. [MN] 
L:  Yeah, no, I could watch that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- three, four times a year.
R:  Ah! [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  So how often do you watch movies? [MN] 
L:  Oh well --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- in the summertime we rarely watch movies at all --
R:  Okay.
L:  Uh, but in, uh, wintertime --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- we'll watch maybe --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- two or three a month.
R:  [NOISE] [MN] So do you do like the outdoorsy thing during the summer so much or ?
L:  [NOISE] Well we have a cabin at the lake, so [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- we spend a lot of time up there and -- and it's just --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- to me watching movies is just a way to fill time.
R:  Right!
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well that makes --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- sense.
L:  Yeah.  How 'bout you?
R:  I'm -- well I like to try to do it once a week but --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- normally --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's like twice a month. [MN] [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, well, you --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  -- get busy with your like you don't have time for that kind [NOISE] of stuff.
R:  Oh yeah.  I mean that's the tru- -- you know it- it's true though, I mean, it is, I guess, kind of a waste of time even though it's [NOISE] a good waste of time. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, well, no it's entertaining, it's relaxing, you blob out --


R:  [MN] 
L:  -- you forget about everything for a couple of hours and, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- then you've got something to talk about after --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- wh- -- like when we watched The Ring --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it was like, ooh!
R:  [MN] [NOISE] 
L:  My husband was like bored to tears --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and I'm going, "Ooh, it's so scary!" [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, how funny!
L:  Yeah.  So 
R:  That's great.  So do you have any kids? [NOISE] 
L:  A- all grown. [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I'm actually going to be a grandmother in, uh, Sep- September so -- for the first time.
R:  [SIGH] Oh, wow! Okay. Well that's --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- cool! [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] So will this be -- [NOISE] 
L:  Looking forward to that.
R:  -- your first -- [NOISE] it'll be your first grandchild? 
L:  Yeah --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Very cool! [NOISE] 
L:  So what do you have there?  A little boy --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- or a little girl?
R:  [NOISE] Um, [MN]  it's a little boy. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah. What's his name?
R:  Yeah, uh, um, Alex. [NOISE] 
L:  Alec?
R:  [NOISE] And he -- it's so funny because like we've bought him some videos and just -- he's a year old and he just loves watching like -- like um, I'm trying to think of [NOISE] the ones -- [NOISE] Lilo and Stitch -- [NOISE] that we got him [NOISE] on pay for view and he just [NOISE] loves it [NOISE] -- he just, you know, it's -- [NOISE] I guess like such an early age they, you know, [NOISE] start to enjoy that type of thing, so  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] Very [MN] 
L:  Well my daughter in law, who's having the baby, she used to work, uh -- she worked one year in Disneyland --
R:  Uh-huh! [MN] 
L:  -- in, uh, Florida --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and she's a right --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- Disney freak so she has --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- all the movies for -- all the Disney movies that have come out --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so far for her kids as she has them, so 
R:  Ah! [MN] 
L:  Yeah, so.
R:  I'm sure we'll probably end up that way also. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] By the time --
L:  Start buying them as you go.
R:  -- it's over. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, it's very profitable for the music [NOISE] industry, it's [NOISE] 
L:  Uh-oh, Alec has something to say here.
R:  [NOISE] He's such a talker.  I tell you what, he's really, um [NOISE] -- he loves the telephone and watching TV and, you know, [NOISE] just -- I guess all the things that, you know, everybody loves, so.  [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] Um -- [SIGH] is there something else we're supposed to say, I wonder? [SIGH] 
L:  No, we're just supposed to talk about movies and --
R:  [NOISE] Movies.  I'm trying to think if there's any other, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- movies that we've done lately.  [SIGH] I want to see the Matrix Two -- I have yet to see that, so. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah well the Matrix One was -- the -- the original was excellent so --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- I'm looking forward to it coming out for video. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right. Like I'm wondering if they're going to be able to do, [LIPSMACK] you know, [NOISE] such a good job with the second one 'cause a lot of times the second one isn't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- as good so 
L:  Right.
R:  But I'm sure --
L:  Well do you -- oh, you go pay for view --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- do you have a DVD player?
R:  [MN] We do, um, and we used to do a lot of, um, renting DVDs but then it's so -- [SIGH] I dunno, you gotta get the kids out of the car and then to the movie store --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- and it's kinda like, "Oh well, I don't know, maybe we'll stay home tonight", so. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Pay for view is a lot easier, isn't it.
R:  [SIGH] Oh, definitely.  I tell you what -- and like the -- price wise it's about the same so we, you know, kinda resorted to that.  I mean I'd love to go out to the movies occasionally, [NOISE] you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Maybe when he gets a little older, you know, 'cause I -- I would -- before, um, I had my son we used to go a lot.  I had a girlfriend and we tried to go like once a week, so 
L:  Really!
R:  [MN] Oh yeah.  We -- we would just -- that was kind of our thing to do, so  [NOISE]
L:  Right.  Do you ever sneak snacks in? [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh definitely! [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know I don't really like the junk they sell at the movie theater so -- [SIGH] 
L:  No.
R:  I used to bring like a Sub in and, you know, type of stuff like that.
L:  Yeah.  No, my, um, company I work for, they supply the movie thea- --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- theat- theaters here locally and it's, like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'm not going to pay that much, I know how much it costs. [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] Oh yeah! [LAUGH] 
L:  So. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] That's funny!
L:  Yep.  If you're a woman and you have a big purse what can they say!
R:  Oh definitely.  Well, you know, I'm not the only one.  I've known a lot of people --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- that, um, typically do that.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  So, you know --
L:  Yeah.  Except for popping the pop cans in the [NOISE] middle of theater can be --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- a little noisy sometimes but... [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh right.  Right. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's funny!
L:  Mm. [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] So, um, are there a lot of theaters in Canada or is that ?
L:  [NOISE] Uh, no.  Well yeah, there is but, ther- -- you know, ah, l- let's see   I'm thinking where --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the city we closest by, we've got one --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- two, three and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- then the cheapie theater, and they've --
R:  Oh, okay!
L:  -- all got about four theaters in them, so 
R:  Okay. [SIGH]  Well that sounds pretty, um -- sounds like there's quite a bit available. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] Oh yeah.  You can watch --
R:  As far as m- --
L:  -- everything.
R:  Yeah, I guess, um, the movie industry has figured out how to get the money is to make sure that there's, you know, tons of theaters everywhere, you know [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  So   
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] Well, I know here, like every mall, almost every other shopping centre.  Or, you know, every time you turn around there's a movie theater, so  [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, well we don't have the population base for that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like we have a million in our entire province so 
R:  Oh wow! Okay. [NOISE] 
L:  Yep. [MN] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  So, it -- it's a big province --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- but there's not a lot of people here so  we don't have -- we have to travel to get to places. [LAUGH] 
R:  Ah!  Okay, well so you're kind of out in the country?
L:  [NOISE] Pardon?
R:  So you're kind of out in the country?
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- we're in the country, so 
R:  Y- that must be nice. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah it is.  Yeah, yeah.  We've been working --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in the yard --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and -- [SIGH] 
R:  Oh yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  -- doing some gardening and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- stuff like that.
R:  Good.
L:  Do you live in a house, or --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- do you live in a condo, or ?
R:  Um, [SIGH] we actually just got a house, um, last year, so we've been doing a lot of the [LAUGH] g- gardening and all that kind of stuff [NOISE] too, so.
L:  Yeah.  That's --
R:  Uh.
L:  -- away from things like ...
