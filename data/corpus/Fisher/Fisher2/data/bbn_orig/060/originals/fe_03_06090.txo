R:  I am Ruthie.
L:  Ruthie?  Hi, I'm -- my name is Monique.
R:  Hi.
L:  Do you play computer games?
R:  Yeah, I do.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, actually I was do -- I'd just logged off, ah, playing Bingo on line.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  I've been playing all day. 
R:  Yeah, it's funny, I was just playing -- I've been playing, ah, on Real One -- Real Arcade.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Was it on line or it -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  It's a lot of fun.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, where do you play -- which, ah, site do you play Bingo on?
L:  Well, ah, Gamesville[?], Pogo and, um, [MN] Crazy Numbers lately.
R:  Oh, what's that one?  I've not heard of that one. 
L:  That one's good.  So far I -- I like that the best.  So -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm sticking with that one.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I found it last week.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Do you play the ones that you, like, pay money and actually -- 
L:  Um --
R:  Ah -- 
L:  -- no.  These are free Bingo games.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.  They're all free, you know?
R:  Yeah.  I've never played money -- I've paid money to play a game on line but I've not -- 
L:  No, I've never done that.  I play, you know, for free.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Me too.  So, um, [LAUGH] where are you from?
L:  Um, I live, um, in Massachussetts.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Boston, Massachussetts.  How about you?
R:  New Jersey.
L:  Oh.  That's not too far away, huh?
R:  Yeah.  Right by, ah, Philadelphia.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] Um, gees.  I don't know how to talk on these subjects for ten minutes.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, well -- 
R:  [several inaudible words] about it [several inaudible words] -- 
L:  -- this is only my -- it -- this is my second -- 
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  -- call.  [LAUGH] Are there any other games that you play?  [COUGH]
R:  Um, well I play -- yeah, I play a lot of games on line.  So, like I used to do, like, the Yahoo games, like, sight games and stuff like that and I just found like the Real One Arcade.  Um, what was the other one?  Oh, it's really fun is, ah, Candy Stand.  It's, um -- like, they have, like, all these, like, fun life saver games and weird crazy, like, Mini Golf and they're really fun.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Oh.  I've never tried those.  Well, I like to play Scrabble a lot.  That -- that's not on line.
R:  Oh, really.
L:  Um, Scrabble and Tetris.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Tetris is fun.  I used to have it on Gameboy when I was a kid.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  So, yeah.  So, lately I've been playing a lot of games.
R:  Yeah.  Do you have, like, cable modem or anything like that?
L:  Ah, what?
R:  Do you have, like, cable modem or anything?
L:  No, I don't.
R:  Ah, it'd be much -- much easier if you did, [LAUGH] I'm sure.
L:  Well -- you said, "Cable modem" right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  No, I don't have that.
R:  Um -- 
L:  It's just a dial up.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, do you?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, yeah.
L:  So, that's why I have to keep logging on.  That's -- 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- what happened.  I had to, you know, reboot.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  'Cause it was getting really slow and it kept kicking me out of the game and -- 
R:  Yeah, I'm sure.
L:  -- I'm like, "Okay, let me reboot 'cause I want to go back".  I was winning.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, and then as soon as I got up it -- you know, I rebooted, the phone started ringing.
R:  Oh, gee.
L:  And I kind of figured this was what it was the, um, Fisher project. 
R:  Right.
L:  'Cause I'd been missing them the last few days 'cause I wouldn't get off the computer.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] I forgot about it actually.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I had one, like, a couple of days ago and that was the first one I'd had.
L:  And I'm glad so far the subjects have been easy.  Um -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  So far -- 
R:  My first subject, we had to talk for ten minutes about, like, one thing we would go back in our lives and change.  [MN] 
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  It -- it was tough to talk for ten minutes about.
L:  Yeah.  Well, my first one was, um, [MN] if you could have your own business, you know, what -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- would it be?  So, that was kind of interesting.
R:  That's neat.
L:  That was -- you know?  And then when I heard this topic I said, "Oh, yeah.  I just got off playing games".
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  That's what I was thinking -- 
L:  This is an easy one.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I know.  I was doing the same thing.
L:  Yeah.  Ah -- 
R:  Um, yeah, actually, I play all the time.  Like, I can't even, like, play -- not play when I'm, like, [inaudible] talking on the phone or whatever.  Really -- I talk on line all the time so -- 
L:  Oh, you chat -- 
R:  -- I'm always -- 
L:  -- a lot on line?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah -- 
L:  Yeah.  I -- 
R:  -- but that's pretty much how I contact all my friends.  Like, all my friends are on line.  It's just easier that way.  Um, like I -- I just graduated from school last year so now -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- ever since I've been home, like, that's how I keep in touch with my school friends and everything.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, I think it's such an easier way of communication.  Um, yeah, I don't know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Okay.  Well, the time should be about up.  Um, um, do you think they're recording us?
R:  I don't -- I don't know.  I don't know how this thing works.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's interesting.  Yeah -- 
L:  Um -- 
R:  -- I have no idea.  [LAUGH] How did you hear about it?
L:  Um, well I belong with this refunding group called Refunding That, and, ah, Makes Sense.  It's a magazine and we have a web site.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And so, you know, there's lots of members and, um, someone found the site and had -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- had did it and received, you know, their money and then posted, you know -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- about it so now, um -- so, you know, everyone signed up for it and -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  There's thousands of us.  You know, it's a big -- 
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- organisation.  Yeah.
R:  Huh.  Yeah, it's -- it's very interesting.  The last person I spoke to was from, I think, Indiana.
L:  Indiana.
R:  Something like that.  I didn't really -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I only -- like, it's from, like, University of Pennsylvania which is like twenty minutes for me 'cause I've got friends that go there and stuff like that so it's interesting that I kind of assumed it was all in this general area.  I didn't realise it was -- like everybody knew about it.
L:  No, it's -- it's all over.
R:  Yeah, that's really good.
L:  I know they're very busy now since -- since I -- you know, once our site found out about it -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, everyone's trying to get that -- 
R:  That's so [inaudible].
L:  -- um, you know, signed up for it.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Yeah, so -- 
R:  Um, did you, like, [inaudible] having when you were, like, on line with the games and stuff [LAUGH] like that?
L:  Um, I haven't really, no.  Not yet -- 
R:  Right.
L:  I -- I kind of -- I'm just kind of quiet and just, you know, read what everyone else is [LAUGH] --  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- gabbing about.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, only if someone, you know, asked me something specifically, um -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, obvious like -- 
R:  I don't know.  I don't like having strangers on line.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, I don't mind it's just that I -- I -- a- a- you know, it just hasn't happened yet, so -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know.
R:  Right.  That makes sense.
L:  But, um, yeah it is -- it's really into -- I've, like, the, um -- you should go to that site, Crazy Numbers.
R:  Crazy -- 
L:  Crazy numbers dot com and there's several, you know, rooms that you can play Bingo in.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They have pay Bingo as well but you go to -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- free games -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, ah -- 
R:  I know I have played Bingo on, like, Yahoo before.
L:  And, um, he calls -- they call the -- the numbers, you know, fast.  It's not real slow -- 
R:  Oh, ah -- 
L:  -- like all the other sites.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you can play more than one room at a time.
R:  Oh, cool. 
L:  And, ah, if -- I guess what you do is, um, once you have a certain amount of points, you can cash them in to go play real Bingo for -- 
R:  Ah.
L:  -- money.  Yeah, you go to the real on line casino or something.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's affiliated with that site and you -- I -- you know, I guess you can play Bingo and try to win real cash.
R:  Right.  Oh, that's interesting.
L:  Yeah, but I -- I never have enough points to even explore the other site.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Right.  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, I'll probably never get over there.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I always, like, end up being like the second one to call Bingo if I play [LAUGH] it. 
L:  Yeah.  But, this one's nice because it's auto.  You don't have to daub or anything.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah, it's really nice.  You can, um -- you know, you put it on auto and it automatically daubs your cards for you.  The maximum amount of cards is eighteen.
R:  Oh, ah.
L:  And it automatically calls, "Bingo" for you.  You don't have to press anything when you have Bingo.  It automatically just says, "Bingo" if you have Bingo.
R:  Well, that's cool.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, so I really -- you know, I discovered this site last week.  I don't know how I found it.  Um -- 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- by accident.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  So, I've been, you know, kind of addicted since I -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- found it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's funny.  When I was in college it was so bad when I -- I would go on line and I would, like, find games and I wouldn't do my homework because of it.  It's awful, but [LAUGH] -- 'cause my friends and I would be like, "Oh, which games did you find?"  [LAUGH]  
L:  I know.  I'm neglecting housework and everything.  [LAUGH]  
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, I -- I'll -- I'll, you know, um -- soon I'll give it a break.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'll force myself.
R:  There are so many more games out there.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  But, I mean, I don't play too many games.  I mean, there's just certain games.  I mean, I used to play Scrabble all the time -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- until I discovered, um, the Bingo sites -- 
R:  Is there -- is there -- 
L:  -- at -- 
R:  -- a Scrabble on line thing?
L:  W- well, no.  I have the Scrabble, you know, the -- the -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the CD.
R:  Oh -- 
L:  Um -- 
R:  -- I see what you mean.
L:  Yeah.  And so I used to play Scrabble all the time, um -- 
R:  Oh.  Yeah, I don't have too many CD rom games.
L:  Yeah, I have a lot.  I have lots of games 'cause I -- my eleven year old, he plays games -- 
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- um, on the computer, ah -- 
R:  I used to have a lot of CD rom games but I haven't really played CD roms in a while.
L:  Yeah.  So, ah -- 
R:  I have, like -- You Don't Know Jack?
L:  What is it?
R:  You Don't Know Jack?  It's a funny trivia game.  It's -- 
L:  Oh.  I -- 
R:  It's really fun.
L:  -- think I've heard of that.
R:  Yeah.  And then I also have, um, the SIMS which is really addicting and once I start playing it I can't stop so I can't play it anymore.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  I know about the SIMS.  Have you ever played FreeCell?
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah.  I love FreeCell.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Minesweeper is the one I like the best though.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, from, like, on the computer.  I play that all the time.  Like, I can play that no matter what I'm doing.  I can always be playing that and I always -- like, when I was in high school I used to play all the time.  All my friends used to laugh at me but I -- like, my times are really good so I want to keep playing and see how [LAUGH] fast I can do.
L:  Uh-huh.  And then sometimes I play Solitaire but -- 
R:  Yeah.  I don't like Solitaire too much.  It's kind of boring -- 
L:  I -- I can't win on that one.  So -- 
R:  Really?
L:  No, I -- I never beat the computer.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah, see I play all these games -- 
L:  I mean, yeah, I do -- 
R:  Like -- 
L:  -- sometimes, like --
