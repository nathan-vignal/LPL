R:  Jessica.
L:  Hi, I'm Renee.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  [MN] So, um, the video and the computer games I like, um, are frogger --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I also play, um, online euchre.
L:  I play online, um, I think it's board dot US or board dot com.  They have all kinds of games and they also have, um, all kinds of pictures and stuff like -- like they have dancing President Bush and all kind of stuff like that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They're into different fun things on there [LAUGH].  That's about the only one I really visit.  I don't do too many games.  I usually stay on that one site.
R:  I've played, um, games on Uproar, um, like Family Feud --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, there's certain other ones, there's, um, Family Feud and Wheel of Fortune.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Those are fun.
L:  Mhm.  The only other things I do, I enter online contests and sweepstakes.
R:  Yeah, so do I.
L:  Yeah.  They're pretty fine especially when you win [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I've won --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I think I've won candy bars, I've won a tee shirt.
L:  Yeah, have you entered the Twix and M and Ms contest, the ones that are recently?
R:  No, my Mum has been doing it though.
L:  Yeah, because I've won a few, um, Twix coupons and M and M coupons and the Twix I won, um, one hundred dollars to Ticketmaster.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, so it's pretty easy.  You just enter, I think, like five codes every day or something and then they pick a winner every day.  They have a bunch of winners.
R:  Wow.
L:  So, it's pretty easy.  So, you can spend a hundred dollars anywhere you want for Ticketmaster.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- so, there's no limit.
R:  And I mean, I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I usually -- what did I usually enter?  I used to do, um, -- oh, it's called -- is it Unlock the Code?  They have it, um, for jeans and stuff.  It was Lee.
L:  Oh, okay, uh-huh.
R:  And I've done that.  I've done, um, oh there's another one.  It was -- I think it was Starburst that had the codes too where you can --
L:  Yeah, yeah.  They had that one.  That was like last month or something I think.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They had, like, tons of people winning tons of free coupons all the time.  That was pretty fun.
R:  Uh, what else?  There's another one I've played.  I enter, like, a lot of, like, HGTV stuff like, you know, redo your home.
L:  Mhm.  I usually just do My Instant Win dot com.  They usually list a few of them and they have always the codes listed for you there too --
R:  Yeah, I've been --
L:  -- so you don't have to search for them.
R:  -- on that site.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They also -- um, there's another one.  It's actually like a scratch off ticket.  You can go, like, every day.
L:  Oh, okay.  I think I've seen that one.  Is it -- I think that might be Sweeps Club or something.
R:  I think so.
L:  Something like -- don't they have, like, the little jester or something in the corner?  It looks like a little clown or something I think.
R:  I think I've played that one too.  It's -- it's called Tombola now I think of it.
L:  Oh, yes.  I've heard of that Tombola, yes, yeah.  I've heard of that one.  Oh.
R:  I like playing that and then they have the hamster race [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, I haven't seen that one.  Well, do you win something from that one or if he stays on the little wheel or something?
R:  If he, um -- if he has beat out -- your -- your guy has to beat out all the rest of the guys which never happens [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].  They always make sure the other one wins.
R:  Yeah, 'cause I'm like I'm so close, I'm like "Go, go, go".
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And then something -- another one comes out and beats me.
L:  Yeah, so are you playing against the computer or is other people playing with you?
R:  For Tombola it's just against their, like, computer because if you -- if you win, you win whatever amount there was that day, like sometimes it's like three thousand.
L:  Oh, hey, yeah.
R:  It's like a high -- it's high money but no-one barely wins.
L:  No, exactly [LAUGH].  Probably somebody at their company wins it all probably [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, and I've played games though, games -- the bingo.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  You can actually win money from that.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  I love bingo so it was nice.
L:  Yeah, I used to -- I usually did bingo but I never win so it was taking too much time so I just stopped playing [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, uh --
L:  It's so addictive.
R:  Yeah, I'd get so close to them but like [MN] then time runs out.
L:  Mhm, and you're always like, "Oh, just one more time, one more time" and before you know it's, like, late at night, you know [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  It takes a lot of time before you win anything though I've heard lots of people win so I don't know.  I guess you just have to be one of the lucky ones.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, I wouldn't mind winning, like, three to four thousand dollars [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, really [LAUGH].  Just for sitting down at the computer for a few hours, it's not a bad deal.
R:  Yeah, you wanna remember when I do that but most fun is from euchre and you don't win anything for euchre but it's just --it's just fun.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, pass the time.
R:  Yeah, give you something to do and I was really addicted to, um, this game called Cubis on Yahoo --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um, it took forever.  Like I was on, like, the forty first level and I'm like, "Yeah, when does this game end?"
L:  Oh, my gosh [LAUGH].  Does it just -- it just keeps going until you -- somebody wins or something or there's a certain amount of levels you have to play?
R:  I have no idea because I think, you know, I was thinking by the, you know, fortieth level, my God, you know.
L:  Yeah, really.  It's like how long are they going to make you keep playing?  Geeze.
R:  Oh, I -- I -- it never said how many levels it had.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It just kept on going and going.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Finally it got -- so I wanted to win so bad, I just got tired of them and I started losing.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Huh.  So, where are you calling from?
R:  Ohio.
L:  Oh, I'm in Michigan.
R:  Oh, I live in Columbus.
L:  Okay, I'm, like, close to Detroit.  I live close to the Detroit airport.
R:  Okay.
L:  Twenty minutes away.
R:  I've been to Detroit.  I've been to, um, the Detroit Museum of Art.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I went there for a Van Gogh exhibit.
L:  Uh-huh.  We've only been to Toledo.  I haven't been anywhere else in Ohio.  I haven't visited anywhere else.
R:  Yeah, we're probably not your favorite state [LAUGH].
L:  What's that?
R:  I said we're probably not you guys' favorite state.
L:  Oh, I don't know. I think it's a lot better than Michigan.  Michigan is kinda -- it's too crowded though it's like -- and Ohio is a different feel, you know.  You feel the people are different, a lot more nicer and stuff I think.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So it's a lot different.  Even though it's not that far away, it's a lot different than Michigan.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've only been in Michigan for, like, three years so --
R:  I see.
L:  -- but I've seen enough over here [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, it -- it -- I spent, like, two, no, three days in Michigan.  I was actually in Detroit --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and it was horrible [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, there's like -- you know, there's crowded over here and the people aren't very friendly or anything but the weather -- I like the weather except for, you know, when it snows.  That's about it [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  The snow's pretty horrible but you probably get lots of snow up there too, don't you?
R:  Yeah, we do.  We get a good batch.  We're right in the middle so I mean, we don't get as much as, you know, northern Ohio --
L:  No.
R:  -- or southern Ohio but we get a good -- we got -- I think we got fifteen inches this year.
L:  Uh-huh.  I don't remember how much we got this year but it was like -- I think in, um, April I think we still had some snow like at least once or twice in April I think we got snow.
R:  Really?
L:  So, it's pretty weird.
R:  Wow.
L:  So, do you have any kids up like the Internet games or anything?  Do you know any kids on the Internet?
R:  No, my son's a year old.
L:  Oh, okay.  I have three girls so [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, he just -- he likes to punch on the computer.
L:  Yeah, try to break the keyboard, huh?
R:  That's all he does.
L:  Yeah.
R:  He turns it off.  He crawls right there and puts his little finger in there and can turn the computer off.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  He likes doing that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Likes turning TVs on and off and --
L:  Uh-huh.  So, is this the first time you do this survey?
R:  What?
L:  Is this the first time you ever do this kind of survey?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, this is my first time too because whenever they told me, whenever I signed up they're like you have to talk to other people and I'm like, "How are you gonna talk to other people, you know.  It's kind of weird, you know, talking to somebody you don't know".
R:  Yeah.
L:  I said, "If they want to pay me for it, I'll do it" [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, yeah, ten bucks [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, really.  I don't know what kind of -- I don't know where they got that idea from but I don't mind so ...
R:  Yeah, because I don't work.
L:  Yeah, exactly and I mean, they -- they pay you ten dollars a call or something.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, that's not bad.
R:  Damn it, I --
L:  They said they want to research how people communicate or something.  I guess, like, their own opinions or something.
R:  I think so.  Mhm.
L:  Mhm.
R:  My Mum does this.  My Mum had two calls.  She's the one that told me about the website.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I just learned about it a few days ago so I was like I wasn't sure if it was legit or not and I thought I'll just find out.  You know, I've nothing to lose so [LAUGH] ...
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  Free money for talking, you know.
L:  Yeah, really.  That's what I'm always looking for on the Internet. You know, the best for your money, I'll be there [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm signing up as soon as possible.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  And then I think some people have done five calls and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- my Mum was on this refund site that actually where she got this from.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Did she go to refund -- Refunding makes Sense?
R:  I think so.
L:  Yeah, that's the one I signed up with.  I get their magazines.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, okay.  so, what's her name?
R:  Jeannie Perkins.
L:  Oh, hey, I don't know her.
R:  She's always on there.  She's always getting coupons and she's a big refunder.  I think that's her thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  She has a --
L:  Yeah, that's what I do.  I have a basement loaded full of stuff using -- that I use coupons with and everything [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, my Mum did too.  She had a whole closet full of just coupons that she's --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [several inaudible words] UPS that she's cut off and --
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I know.  Most people think we're kind of weird, you know.  They'll like, "Why you save trash?" you know [LAUGH] but when you get the free stuff, it's all worth it so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- usually they're wanting the free stuff, you know.  They're always asking me, "How do you get it?  How do you get it?"
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So ...
R:  We got a -- a free Palm Pilot from, um, just test driving stuff.
L:  Yeah, Yeah.  I had -- did that one too.  There's a bunch of them, like, I did one not too long ago for seventy five dollars to Amazon and I think it was from Mercedes.
R:  Really?  Wow.
L:  Yeah, and ...
