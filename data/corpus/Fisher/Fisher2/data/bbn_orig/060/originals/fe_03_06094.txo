L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  How are you?
L:  Okay.  Um, the subject is computer games.
R:  Yes.
L:  How do you like that?
R:  I like that.
L:  You do?  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm -- 
R:  I have a lot of them.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well then you better do most of the talking because I don't play computer games.
R:  I don't play on line, I just play regular games and I've got four kids that play 'em too.
L:  Oh, they do.  Oh, well, you have four kids so they would play them.
R:  Yes.
L:  But, um, [MN] I -- I'm single and I just don't play them and, um, I have nothing against them but I'm, um, [MN] I -- you know, Scrabble's about the -- the length I go to playing a game, you know?
R:  Yes.  [LAUGH] 
L:  And maybe occasionally if I run into something at, you know, um, at the airport or whatever.
R:  Yes.
L:  But, I don't really know anything about computer games.  Ah, what do your children play?
R:  Um, a lot of them play the Play School.
L:  Oh, I've heard of that -- 
R:  Ah, puzzles and stuff like that and -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Blues Clues.  Just educational.
L:  Oh, educational.
R:  Yeah.  Well, it's three and four year old.  It teaches -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- 'em how to count and say their A.B.C.s and stuff like that.
L:  Oh, that's wonderful.  I -- you know, it's wonderful to be a child because they catch on to everything so fast, you know?
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  They don't have to take a class to do it.  They don't have any, um, barriers to thinking about it.  They just do it, you know?
R:  I know.
L:  Because it's like we learn writing, you know?  [LAUGH] 
R:  They learn a lot sooner than they used to.
L:  Oh, yeah, that's, ah -- and that's [inaudible] 'cause, um, it's just automatic, like we learned arithmetic or spelling or whatever else, you know -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you don't think about it, yeah?  So, do you play them yourself too?
R:  Ah, I play the Blues Clues game [LAUGH] with my four year old.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, most of the time I play, like, Solitaire and stuff like that.
L:  Oh, yeah, actually, you know, when I think about it when I was taking computer class I was playing Solitaire and that was fun, you know?
R:  Yes, this -- this -- 
L:  So, I just didn't think I had but actually I have and that wasn't too difficult and, um, um, it was -- it was fun.  I really enjoyed that Solitaire.  It was b- better than playing it, you know, just with regular cards.  So, I -- I have to say I did play a couple of them.  It ju- just hasn't been for a while and I, um, gave away all my electronic stuff as I'm trying to, ah, decorate my apartment, so I just gave it away.  [LAUGH] --  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm going to start over with a, um, um, um, what are you -- um, what do you call the, um, email and, um, [MN] um, what's the other thing.  Um, [MN] um, [MN] internet, you know -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Can you play, um, games on the internet?
R:  Oh, yeah.  You can play all kinds of games on the internet.
L:  Oh, okay.  So, when I get my internet I'll, um, [MN] delve into that again.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, we -- we play a lot of [several inaudible words] games too. 
L:  Oh, [several inaudible words], yeah, that I know about and -- 
R:  It's -- it's kind of fun too.
L:  Yeah, um, have -- do you ever go to [several inaudible words]?
R:  Haven't been yet.
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  But, we watch it every week.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Where do you live?
R:  In, ah, [inaudible] Kentucky.
L:  Oh.  Oh, that's nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, do you have any -- um, I'm thinking Kentucky, I watch the Kentucky Derby.  Do they have any, like, horse races on, um, in those games?
R:  I think they do -- 
L:  C- c- --  
R:  -- I have never purchased -- 
L:  -- computer games.
R:  -- one.  We -- we buy so many that are just for the kids instead.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause we've got -- my eight year old has her own computer and she's got her own games downloaded in that and then the -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- four year old plays on line.  So -- 
L:  Yeah.  Well, they're -- then they are games.  They're not, um, educational, right?
R:  Oh, yeah, there's -- there's all kinds.
L:  Yeah, they're all kinds.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do they spend a lot of time on that?
R:  Not very -- like the four year old spends about an hour and a half during the day back and forth, you know.  But, hers are educational.
L:  Oh, all right -- 
R:  The other one -- 
L:  -- well, then that's okay.  Well, it's better than watching television then, right?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  The other -- the eight year old, she plays it maybe thirty minutes of a day.
L:  Yeah, well -- 
R:  When she comes from school.
L:  -- that's okay.  Yeah.  And -- 
R:  But -- 
L:  -- um, do they each have their own computer?
R:  Just, ah, the eight year old has hers and then we've got ours.
L:  Oh, all right.
R:  I'm not ready to buy a four year old one yet.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] Well, they have little -- little ones for kids -- 
R:  'Cause she's got a little, ah -- 
L:  -- I mean, they have -- 
R:  -- she's got a Barbie laptop computer.
L:  Oh, a Barbie laptop.  Isn't -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that adorable.  Are they expensive?
R:  About forty dollars.
L:  Oh, that's not bad for a Christmas -- 
R:  No.
L:  -- gift, yeah.  'Cause I -- I buy a lot of gifts for my nephews and nieces but I'm -- I haven't bought them any computers and I buy, um, [MN] um, yeah, it gets, you know, like, what do you call the software, you know, as gifts -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  And I -- 
R:  That's the best -- 
L:  -- just -- yeah, I -- when I sat down at the comput- -- but they're not, ah -- yeah, actually I bought one recently.  I'd forgotten it, yeah, um, Monopoly, 'cause I found that the person wanted Monopoly and it's in the drawer because it's -- there birthday's coming up so I just asked them what they -- and I sort of, um, I don't know, I guess, sort of gave 'em a list and they picked that one out.  So, it's in the drawer.  But, it -- it's such a little thing, um, that I hope I remember to wrap this up into something -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know, to give it as a gift because it seems -- it just seems like nothing.  But, that -- 
R:  It seems small but I tell you, that's almost the best gift.  My -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- kids love to get computer -- 
L:  Oh, they do?
R:  -- software.  Oh, yeah.
L:  Oh, that's good to know because, ah, as I said, even though I'm not into it myself I -- I realise other people are and I'm -- and the more I think about it I've bought quite a few of these things for different people, you know, just -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- finding out what their interest was, um, because everybody's into it except, I guess, me.  But, I am very conscious of it and I give it as gifts and so -- 
R:  Yeah, the computer games are a big stocking stuffer [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah -- 
R:  -- at Christmas time.
L:  Well, they're not that cheap either, you know, for stocking stuffers are they?
R:  Yeah, they're not but, you know?
L:  This one cost me thirty dollars I think when -- 
R:  Well, that's high.
L:  -- I bought it.  Yeah.
R:  I, ah -- my stocking stuffer computer disks are nine ninety six.
L:  Oh -- 
R:  And they -- 
L:  Hey, what a minute, ah, when I think about it more I bought, um, [MN] I don't use 'em but boy I've got a couple of others in there.  I said, "Gee, if I have" -- um [MN] when I go out of time and visit my friends who have kids, um, yeah, I bought a couple of others.  They're stashed in there to bring along at the right time.  [LAUGH] I just don't think about them except --  
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know?  I asked somebody if I got -- buy better ones than their parents do, which is funny because I go in and ask with the kids there.  I have to find some kids in the store and ask them what the hot one is and I buy that. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, ah, their mothers wonder how [LAUGH] I come up with it.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  I could -- 
L:  I say, "'cause I guess I don't have children, I just go ask what the hottest thing is for such and such an age and I give 'em that one" yeah.
R:  And like I said, I very rarely buy the games just for fun.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause they're usually the higher ones but, like, the ones that I'll -- Preschool -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what you use -- you can get them pretty reasonable and it helps them out at quite a bit.
L:  Oh, yeah, that's -- that's -- 
R:  'Cause they use computers as a kindergartener now.  So -- 
L:  Do they?
R:  Yes.
L:  Um, do they -- well, what kind of computer do they use in -- in kindergarten?
R:  Ah, they've got a computer lab at a school now.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, like -- 
L:  I mean, that's a regular computer?
R:  It's a real -- real computer.
L:  And -- 
R:  Like a Dell or -- 
L:  -- how does a -- 
R:  -- Gateway.  [LAUGH] 
L:  But, a little child can figure that out how to get into it and out of it -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and push the right buttons?
R:  And my [several inaudible words] got on line.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, he got into my mail one day.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're -- it's -- they're -- I don't know how they do it but they figure out these games really easy.
L:  It's amazing.  It -- 
R:  It is.
L:  -- just com- -- yeah.  It's a -- it's just a whole different mentality.  I mean the -- though I -- I envy them because I said, "I bet you could learn a language that way too" you know, as opposed to we didn't learn languages 'til we were in --  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- high school, you know?  And by then, you know, you're -- you're just mentally not ready for it but that's the best way to learn them when you're very young, you know?  But, they're going to be wizards by the time they graduate from grammer school, right?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I tell you, my eight year old, she asked for a computer for Christmas and we got her a Gateway but she -- that's what she needs now, you know?  She's in second grade but they use 'em all the time.
L:  [MN] And then when she comes home does she do he homework on that?
R:  No.  She -- ah, their homework's still on work sheets, you know, and stuff.
L:  Yeah, that -- that surprises me because I see these kids with these huge backpacks, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I'm thinking, if you're doing computers why do you need these huge backpacks?  I mean, they're bigger than they are, you know?
R:  I know.
L:  [MN] Ah, so, um, so they're doing -- they're still using paper, huh? 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Oh, that's -- 
R:  Yeah, they just -- 
L:  -- interesting.
R:  -- use their computer if they read a book.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And to take the test they use the computer.
L:  They -- at school they -- they -- they use the -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- computer to take the test?
R:  Uh-huh.  In some of -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- the thing.
L:  Oh, that's amazing, yeah.  [MN] Um, I guess I better [several inaudible words] just [several inaudible words] the subject is computer games and not computers [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I guess [several inaudible words] the games.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, in the evening when you're just hanging out or on the weekends with your kids do you play computer games?
R:  I do.  Ah, I like to watch the -- I like to play the Solitaire.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Well, that you can play on your own.
R:  Yeah, oh, like I said, I play the Blues Clues and I play the Neptune Racing with them.
L:  Yeah.  That's all included in the computer.  You don't have to go out and buy that, right?
R:  No, we -- we bought most of it.
L:  You did buy most of them.
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah.  'Cause when I was on computers they had that Solitaire, you know, right -- 
R:  Yeah, the Solitaire -- 
L:  -- in there.
R:  -- and all that comes on it but, like -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah, like, ah, Nickelodeon Racing -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- where you dress up the Barbie -- 
L:  Oh, no kidding.
R:  -- and stuff like that.
L:  Oh.
R:  And they really enjoy that.
L:  [MN] And how, um [MN] -- so it's -- you don't have a real Barbie.  You -- you -- you do it on the computer.
R:  Right.
L:  Oh, that's -- and that's sufficient for them?  They'd rather do that than have the real Barbie?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh, isn't that -- 
R:  Oh, yeah, 'cause you can change the Barbie's face to a monkey -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and put her -- the monkey in a dress.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, they have -- 
R:  But -- 
L:  -- all these options -- 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you can push.
R:  Yeah, you can do the fireman or whatever.  It doesn't have to be Barbie all the time.
L:  Ah, how about Ken?  [LAUGH] 
R:  How about -- excuse me?
L:  Ken.  You know, the one -- the -- 
R:  Yeah, ah -- 
L:  -- the boy.
R:  -- yeah, that's got that too.
L:  And the tuxedo or a swimsuit or whatever have -- 
R:  Oh, they've got -- they've got all kinds of suits.
L:  Oh.
R:  Everything.
L:  And that keeps them busy for a while?
R:  Yeah, ah, the puzzles where you put the pieces together -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and figure out how they attach.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then we also have an ocean, ah --
