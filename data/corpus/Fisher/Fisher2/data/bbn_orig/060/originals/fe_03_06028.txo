L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello.
L:  [NOISE] Hello.  I --
R:  Hi.
L:  -- oh, I was waiting for the tone. [LAUGH]
R:  I know, I --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- thought I heard a tone.  Hi, I'm --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- Lisa.
L:  Hi, I'm Sheryl. 
R:  Hi, Sheryl, where are you calling from?
L:  Well, I live in Los Angeles. 
R:  Okay, I live in, ah, right across the Golden Gate Bridge.  I'm in Marine County.
L:  Oh, okay.  Right up north San Franscisco.
R:  Yep.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Right up north.
L:  Okay, great.  I guess they must match people who live in the same state or something, what --
R:  I have a --
L:  -- do you think?
R:  -- feeling -- I have a feeling they do, because --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- any -- um, and the last person I talked to was from Southern California.
L:  Oh.
R:  It was a -- it was a man and he was -- h- he was around my age.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I'm -- I'm, like, fifty.
L:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH] So --
R:  I don't know how old you are, but --
L:  Ah. [LAUGH] So, we're supposed to discuss affirmative action in --
R:  Af- --
L:  -- the work place.
R:  -- -firmative action in the --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- work place.
L:  So, what do you think about it?  Do you think it's a good --
R:  Well --
L:  -- idea?
R:  -- I -- I really was always -- I always really thought affirmative action was great --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- when it came to, um, [MN] to school and -- and -- and definitely, um, I think -- uh, yeah, I -- I'm for affirmative action.  H- how do you feel about it?
L:  Well, y- -- I -- I think to -- to, um, even things up, you know, sometimes people have to be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- coaxed into doing things, um, legally, [LAUGH] you know.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Otherwise --
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  -- otherwise I think people kinda [MN] -- especially older people, say, sixty five, seventy, you know, that generation --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I think they maybe were -- wouldn't -- were resistant to change, so I think affirmative action is a good thing.  I mean, um, you know, I've heard lots of stories and whatnot and I think without it, um, w- we wouldn't have gotten very far, you know --
R:  I agree.
L:  -- as a society [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- at all.  Um, it's -- it's -- it's sad, you know, [LAUGH] but -- but it's, you know, the way it was and it's hard to change people's minds --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- you know, if they have something -- and a lot of times, they don't know why they have that in their minds.  I think it's, um, advertising has a lot to do with it, just society in general, and it just builds and builds and builds, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  So, yeah, so in the work place, I -- I don't think -- I don't think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um -- [NOISE] [MN] you know, I -- I -- I'm hoping that when people view affirmative action, that they don't look at it as -- as giving unqualified people, um, a greater --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- opportunity, but giving qualified people an equal opportunity, that's what I, you know -- that's --
R:  That's what I -- tha- -- I think you've said that really well --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is giving qual- -- is giving qualified peo- -- qualified people --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- equal opportunity.
L:  I don't -- I -- you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if I -- I don't want -- I, you know, would -- would not want anyone to just assume that, you know, because they're a -- a certain race or ethnic background --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- right --
R:  That's right.  There you go.
L:  -- that they should go first just because, you know.
R:  That's right, exactly.
L:  But, yeah.
R:  [MN] When you're looking -- and -- and I think that -- that we -- that I agree with you.
L:  [NOISE] Mm.
R:  When you're looking at qual- -- w- what people are qualified for, um, I think that in years past, I mean, I -- I was -- I was always glad there was affirmative action in college --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- and at school --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and so bringing that into the work place because -- [SIGH] because growing up it was a man's world, it was a white man's world --
L:  Right
R:  -- pretty much.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I still believe it can be and is, and so I think it's been very positive for --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- qualified people regardless of their ethni- ethnicity or their --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [MN] or, ah, or their, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, or their sex, um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know. 
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.
R:  Totally.
L:  Right.
R:  Totally.
L:  It gives -- it gives, you know, a broad spectrum of people, which is what the --
R:  Right.
L:  -- country is made up of, the world is made up of, you know --
R:  [NOISE] That's right.
L:  -- so it's not just one thing, it's -- it's, you know, it's everybody and I think everybody should be represented.  
R:  Absolutely, and I think that that's --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- what th- --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- being an American in the United States was -- was [MN] -- should have been and is based on and should be based on today.
L:  Well --
R:  Um --
L:  -- you know, actually when -- when peo- -- I think when the country was founded, though, it was -- they were looking for, um, religious freedom.  I don't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, I -- I don't think ethnicity --
R:  I think they were looking --
L:  -- [LAUGH] --
R:  -- I think they were looking for --
L:  -- came into play. [LAUGH]
R:  I don't think it did either and I think --
L:  No, I mean --
R:  -- you know, [inaudible] --
L:  -- 'cause everybody was homogeneous.  I mean, it was [SIGH] -- it was, ah, the Europeans, you know, they were British period, and that's who --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- you know, um --
R:  Well, the Europeans, the French, the --
L:  -- settled the country.
R:  -- the -- yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The Anglos.
L:  Initially, yeah, exactly, Europeans.
R:  But I think that it was [MN] --
L:  And then they came and, you know, of course there were other --
R:  And they built --
L:  -- people here. [LAUGH]
R:  -- this country saying that all people sh- -- that's right, that --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- this should be a place for all people to --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- be able to --
L:  Oh, God --
R:  -- to live.
L:  -- I know.  It's, ah, yeah, it's -- it's --
R:  I mean --
L:  -- yeah, it can --
R:  -- p- -- and people did come from China, Japan, I mean --
L:  Oh, yes --
R:  -- [MN] --
L:  -- [MN] to settle. 
R:  -- the Orient, to --
L:  Eventually, I mean, everybody played a role, everybody [SIGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, Greeks and, you know, just everybody --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- came from -- to the New World, that's what it was, you know.
R:  Yeah, except for --
L:  It's this --
R:  -- except -- 
L:  -- wonderful --
R:  -- for African Americans.  
L:  Well, uh --
R:  Except for people of color and then they -- well, there was --
L:  Well, they --
R:  -- you know --
L:  -- no, they didn't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- come voluntary- --
R:  They were kidnapped.
L:  [MN] Exactly --
R:  They didn't come voluntarily.
L:  -- kidnapped.  No, it wasn't a voluntary thing, [LAUGH] you know.
R:  No, it wasn't. 
L:  It wasn't --
R:  No, yeah, that -- 
L:  -- voluntary, but, you know, um, ah, and I think that's probably -- and I think -- I th- -- yeah, that -- that's probably what makes the greater -- greater difference, was that it wasn't voluntary and they were exploited.
R:  It does [MN] -- I think absolutely.  I think that that really did make a difference and I think --
L:  It [MN] yeah --
R:  -- that people that --
L:  -- 'cause everybody else --
R:  -- came here by choice --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- really did excel and did succeed.
L:  And they could assimilate, I mean, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it didn't -- if you were Irish or if you were, um, from, ah, ah, ah, France --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I mean, you could barely --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- tell a difference, I guess, unless the person opened their mouths, so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so other ethnic groups are able to assimilate into --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- a, you know, into the society.  The people who look different, the Native Americans, ah, Asians --
R:  Or they're -- and the cultural differences.
L:  Exactly.
R:  If you -- sure.
L:  Then it's --
R:  The cultural diff- -- people live where [SIGH] -- you know, people, I think, live to -- [MN] in their -- they live with the people that came from the same places they came from. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  If you're from Ara- -- from Russia --
L:  Oh, right, 'cause you could survive --
R:  -- you were [inaudible] --
L:  -- you could survive.
R:  Absolutely.  
L:  And everybody took --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- 'cause everybody was -- I --
R:  Or Italy, you know, I mean --
L:  Yeah, of course.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Everybody had their own little worlds and neighborhoods because, you know, ah, because of jobs, because of fear --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- because of --
R:  A new place to --
L:  -- getting along --
R:  -- live.
L:  -- because of family, you know.
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  [NOISE] Because of family, you know, um, Jewish immigrants --
R:  Well, because of culture, that's right. 
L:  Exactly.  I know --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- [inaudible] was a whole different, you know, culture, people trying to [NOISE] -- to -- to blend in and -- and --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- and -- and, you know, I think really in the end, I think for the most part it does work, [LAUGH] you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- even though --
R:  Absolutely. 
L:  -- yeah.
R:  There's no other place I would wanna live in this world as a -- as a woman.
L:  Well, I know --
R:  There's no other place --
L:  -- of other places I'd wanna live, I mean, [LAUGH] you know.
R:  I don't think so.
L:  Really?
R:  I think that growing up -- I mean, there are places today I would want to live, but I think the freedom that I --
L:  Oh, yeah --
R:  -- that I've had --
L:  -- oh, this is by far, I mean, you know --
R:  Absolutely. 
L:  Yeah, this is --
R:  As a woman.
L:  -- wonderful, yeah.
R:  Just as a -- as a woman.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And as a single --
L:  Oh, God --
R:  -- as a single mother --
L:  -- as a female, we are --
R:  [NOISE] Absolutely.
L:  We are --
R:  There's no other pl- --
L:  -- yeah.  We are --
R:  I mean, I can be very critical and there are things that I criticize about our government and --
L:  Oh, of course and --
R:  -- the people that run it, but, um --
L:  And then there are --
R:  -- [inaudible] freedom.
L:  And you have every right. [LAUGH] And we --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- will defend your right --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to -- to --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- speak your mind, [LAUGH] you know.
R:  Well, that's the thing because freedom of [NOISE] --
L:  Might not dis- -- might not agree, but ... [LAUGH]
R:  That's right, but people don't have to, and there's freedom of speech here -- here as well.
L:  Oh, absolutely, absolutely. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  And, um, you know, it carries --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- carries responsibility, but, um, but definitely, affirmative active in the work place I think is a good thing. 
R:  Absolutely.
L:  Um, you know, until --
R:  I agree.
L:  -- and -- a- and I see it changing, I -- you know, I -- I -- I, [SIGH] you know, ah, just, i- -- you know, if we look historically, say in the sixties, you know, with -- with the advent of a civil rights movement and that -- that sort of thing, I -- I've -- I've -- I think changes obviously -- inroads have been made, it's still --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- it's still --
R:  -- absolutely.
L:  -- you know, we're still working on it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but --
R:  There's a lot --
L:  -- but, it [MN] --
R:  Right. 
L:  Great strides, I think --
R:  There was a --
L:  -- have taken place. 
R:  -- Newsweek article about, um, African American women and how they've excelled in the workforce --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in the --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- last -- in -- i- i- i- in, um, this new century and --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- that they've gone far beyond [SIGH] -- that they are -- uh, that -- that they are in the boardrooms and [MN] -- you know, how they've exceeded --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and I th- -- it -- it was just -- it -- I think it was a article -- I've got it on my desk at work, I think in --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- September.  Excellent article. 
L:  Oh, really, uh-huh.
R:  About into the boardroom, absolutely.
L:  Oh, okay.  Now, what -- what type of work do you do?
R:  Um, I'm in marketing right now --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and I'm also a caterer, so I've got a couple of --
L:  Oh, a caterer?
R:  -- different things.  Yeah.
L:  Oh, wow.  That's interesting.
R:  I'm a food person.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I'm a chef.
L:  Oh, fabulous.
R:  And I work in a market research firm -- yeah, I --
