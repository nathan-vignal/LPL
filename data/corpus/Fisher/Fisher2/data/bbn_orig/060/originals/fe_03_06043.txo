L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name is Angel.
L:  Hi, I'm Ying.  How are you doing?
R:  Hi.  I'm doing very well, thanks.
L:  [LAUGH] That's good.
R:  This is kind of weird, huh?
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  Is this your first call?
L:  Oh, really?  This is I think my third and so my last one.
R:  Your third.  Okay, so you're almost done.  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  Right on.  So, I guess we're supposed to talk about movies.
L:  Mhm.
R:  What's --
L:  W- --
R:  -- the last movie you saw?
L:  Ah, I actually just went and saw X Two last weekend and I'm going to see ah Dying with Love tomorrow.
R:  Oh, right on.  Dying with Love's supposed to be really good.  Um, I didn't see X Two, but everyone said it was amazing.  But I saw Matrix the other night.
L:  Oh, did you?  How'd you like that?
R:  It was really good.
L:  Really?
R:  Um, I never saw the first one, which is really odd, I know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, I kept falling asleep during it, I thought it was really boring --
L:  Really?
R:  -- so odd, I know.  But um I wanted to give it a try again and sure enough, it's pretty amazing.
L:  Wow, that's 'cause ah that's so strange because um all the guys at my ah job, they took last, what was it, Thursday off, like half the day off --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they all went to see the Matrix and like pretty much all of them, ah, they loved the first one and when they came back, the reviews were very mixed from them.
R:  Right.  About the second one?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I had both with the friends I went with as well.  They were like -- the people who liked it better and the people who liked it -- liked the first one better too.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  I just felt like, okay, what I think happened in the first one and the second one to me --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- is that I feel like the first twenty minutes of the movie was kind of boring --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they -- they took too long like studying up --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just the movie, but like without telling you what was supposed to happen, like without giving you the action cue --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and so I think that's why I kept falling asleep during the first one and likewise with this one because the first twenty minutes I was like, "I don't know about this" like --
L:  Uh- huh.
R:  -- I'm kind of bored.  But --
L:  Wow.
R:  But yeah, but then the action kicks in and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you figure out what he's looking for and it all starts to make sense and you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it's a lot --
L:  S- --
R:  -- better.
L:  -- now that you've seen the second one and you liked it, are you going to go out and rent the first one?
R:  I don't know.  I wasn't sure about that.  I kind of think yeah, but I'll probably wait till I'm just home and I bet they're playing it on um you know HBO and all that again, probably.
L:  [LAUGH] Uh-huh.
R:  Since the second one's out.  So, I'll just catch it for free.
L:  That's true.
R:  But I guess that being said, what was the other question?  Do you like to rent movies or to go out to the theater best?
L:  Um, I actually never rent movies 'cause ah when I do I never find -- I feel so pressured that I have to find the time to watch the movies and most of the time I -- I just don't have the time.
R:  Right.  Well, that's really --
L:  So I -- I --
R:  -- interesting.  You're the first person I think I've ever met who doesn't really rent movies.
L:  Yeah, I've only rented movies probably like four times in my entire life.
R:  Wow!
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  So, you don't even have like a video membership or anything?
L:  No.  I actually ah my sister has one and she gave me a card from hers and that was pretty much it.  I don't have a b- -- a Blockbuster membership, I don't have any of that stuff.
R:  That's kind of cool.
L:  Uh-huh.  I don't know, I just -- yeah, I just ah ne- -- and like my sister, she likes buying DVDs so ah usually she'll buy something and I can always borrow it from her if I really need to, but yeah.  I also happen to work in entertainment and so we have a lot of screenings and I go to a lot of those too, so I see movies for free in theaters.
R:  Wow, that's really nice.
L:  Yeah.  And I s- --
R:  That's really nice.  I don't know anyone I n- -- that's ever really been in that position.
L:  Um --
R:  We auctioned off some Miramax um sneak preview tickets at an auction here -- I'm in law school --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But that's about as fabulous as my life gets when it comes to the movies.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um and I --
L:  Well --
R:  -- certainly did not buy them.
L:  It's not fabulous, but ah, yeah, it's pretty cool.  It's nice because you don't um, you know, have to deal with the waiting in line and the tickets running out and everything like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that.  You can just go and it's -- it's ah -- these are actually people who are in -- in the [inaudible] they tend to pay a lot more attention to the movie, so there's not like talking to the screen or talking to each other and stuff like that.
R:  Cool.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I can say like normally talking in the theater bothers me, but the other night at um Matrix, we were talking during -- there weren't even the previews, they were like the ads like don't talk on your cellphone --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- those, you know, get some popcorn --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and like all these people were yelling at us.
L:  Really, already?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh.
R:  Which I thought was kinda weird, but they were sort of younger kids, I guess, like maybe nineteen --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and they were like shh.
L:  Really?
R:  And finally, you know, my friend said, "What's up?  Like, I don't get it, you know, like the lights have not even gone done, I assure you, like, we won't be talking when the lights go down" --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and the kids like "Because if you're quiet they'll start the movie".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Which I thought was like the oddest thing I had ever heard in my whole life.
L:  That is --
R:  But ah --
L:  -- weird.
R:  Yeah.  It was really weird.
L:  Oh.
R:  But um -- so, yeah, I would say the only reason I don't like going to the theater is because obviously I want to see this stuff when it's new --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but then it's always so full.
L:  Yeah, I hate that.  I --
R:  Like even if it doesn't sell out, it's just like stuffed with people --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and they always leave seats open, you know, but never like always just a seat, which just bothers me.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, like ah I went to ah -- when I went to X Two I actually went with ah some people after dinner and they chose it, which is I went to X Two, because I would never -- I hate going to movies that are opening like it's exactly because of that, because there are too many people, they're often talking, the only seats left, you know, a lot of times are the ones that are in front and we actually ended up probably like in the second or third row --
R:  Right.
L:  -- back from the screen, which is very uncomfortable to watch a movie from.
R:  Yeah, for sure.
L:  And -- yeah, I -- I hate -- I absolutely hate going to ah movies in the first weekend just because of that.
R:  Yeah, it just sucks.  It totally does.  So, I miss a lot because obviously everyone goes the first weekend that you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and then I just don't, you know, and then like a week later, unless it's something like the Matrix that people want to see two or three times --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- then I end up not going, because I don't really like going by myself, I don't guess.  I don't know why, I mean it's just a movie, but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it's just never --
L:  A lot of p- -- a lot of people are that way.  I ah once worked with this girl who one of her big objectives in life for some reason was to go to the movies alone --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it took her like weeks and weeks and weeks to be able to do it.
R:  To work up to it, yeah.  [inaudible] have gone to the movies alone, but it does just seem so like ah, you know.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I mean, I guess it starts to really make it seem like why did I not just rent a video, like --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- when you're by yourself --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because you're kind of walking out of the theater and it seems like you know well, that was nice but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I mean part of going to the movies almost is like the social interaction of like I don't know, being in line with your friends and getting popcorn and whatever, like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- even though you don't talk during the movie, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I don't know, I -- I do rent a lot of movies.  I would say -- I mean, not here so much now that I'm in school again I probably only rent maybe two a month.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  But I would say at home, like when I go home to visit my parents --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- we'd definitely rent like four every couple of days.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.
R:  I mean, until obviously like we've all seen something and then there's a lull until a bunch of new stuff comes out, but [COUGH].
L:  That's really interesting.
R:  It's very strange.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  So, that being said, like I see a lot of kinds of movies, like cheesy --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and not cheesy --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Hollywood and not Hollywood.
L:  What's the best movie you've seen recently?
R:  Um, I don't know.  I mean, now Matrix was really so cool --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I guess -- I mean, I don't know.  I have a hard time saying I have favorite anything --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- really in life.  So, moviewise, I don't know.  Like, I like old stuff really best so even recently -- recently, nothing so amazing.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  But I really like [inaudible] and --
L:  Oh, yeah.  That's sort of -- that was a really funny movie.
R:  Cult classic, [inaudible] stuff like that.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  But I end up --
L:  That was great.
R:  I mean, I just end up seeing a lot of different kinds of movies.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I'm trying to think.  I was just saying to someone the other day.  I saw something recently that I knew was really good, but I don't remember what um -- what about you?  What's the best you've seen recently?
L:  Oh, recently I really enjoyed um Secretary which was actually not that recent, but [LAUGH].
R:  I did not see that.
L:  It was so really good.
R:  But I heard it was funny.
L:  Yeah.  I loved it.  I thought it was great.  It was very funny and um it is slightly dark and just interesting, you know, the dynamics of the two people and their relationship and just her -- the way she grew and you know like him as well.  But yeah I -- I thought it was really interesting.  And I -- I really liked Narc as well, that was a great a kind of gritty cop drama.
R:  Right on.  No, I definitely did not see that at all.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I haven't --
L:  It came and went really quickly.  I think th- -- like ah from what I heard, originally um when it was going around there was a lot of buzz about it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but people weren't too like they didn't think it would do very well and it ended b- -- that ended up being exactly the case, there was a lot of buzz at the theaters and ah the people who were in charge of awards and things like that, but when it came out, nobody really went and saw it, so it disappeared really quickly.
R:  Right.  I feel like maybe it came out when I was living out of the country because I just feel like I don't even I never even heard of it --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- until like I was talking to someone and they've seen it.  Like, when did it come out?
L:  It came out probably um, it came out in time for the Oscars, so ah probably somewhere around the first or second week of December.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I was totally here.
L:  So, ah but until like when um when the Oscar times comes around, ah there are free screenings for everything at that time, right, so um I got the invitation -- I'd never heard of the movie.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah, so it was -- it was really quiet, but apparently a lot of people had buzz.  Like when I went I ran into some guy who was like, "Oh, what are you here for?" and I said, "I'm here to see Narc" and he's like, "Oh, that's the like sixth screening we've had for that movie" and I had no idea.
R:  Wow.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Wow.  Yeah, so okay, I think I remember it.  Y Tu Mama Tambien I think was the best movie I've seen in a while and I watched it in video, so I guess it's probably like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- six years old or something.
L:  Y Tu Mama Tambien?
R:  Yeah.
L:  No, that just came out last ah -- last -- around Oscar time, too, I think.
R:  Did it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  No, it didn't.
L:  Like November, Octo- -- was it?
R:  No way.  It's got to be older.
L:  No.
R:  Did it really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  What?  Here, I'll just look it up on line.  That's crazy.
L:  Oh wait ... maybe -- maybe a year and a half ago.  But --
R:  Right.  But still not nearly --
L:  -- or a year ago.
R:  -- as long ago as I thought.
L:  Yeah, no, not even close.
R:  Wow.  I thought it was like
