L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Christine.
R:  Hi, I'm Ramona, how are you?
L:  Well I'm wonderful, how 'bout you?
R:  Great, great.  Just --
L:  Great!
R:  -- um, [LAUGH] lying down. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Where are you from?
L:  Michigan, how 'bout yourself?
R:  I'm from New York. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh!
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Wonderful!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH] So --
R:  Yeah. [MN] 
L:  -- do you go to the movies? [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] I have not been in a very long time.
L:  Oh really? [LAUGH] 
R:  No. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Because you don't like them --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or you've just prefer to rent --
R:  [MN] 
L:  --'em at home or ...?
R:  Um, I'm -- I usually just stay home with them.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I'd rather, because they're so expensive!
L:  Well, that's very true.
R:  To be true! [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, absolutely --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- absolutely.
R:  How about you?
L:  Well I like, you know, I like to go to the theater.  My husband and I like to go but we go see 'em when they're cheaper, 'cause we have the -- well they used to be ninety nine cents, now they're two dollars, but they still cheaper than going to the [LAUGH] regular show. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah? [NOISE] 
L:  So we -- w- you know, we'll wait till the feature's been out for -- oh, probably about a month and then it'll go to the cheap flicks then we'll go see it and --
R:  Oh, okay, okay --
L:  -- you know.
R:  -- okay.  See, up here they start [LAUGH] out at ten dollars a pop --
L:  Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
R:  Ooh honey! I'm not going --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- anywhere.  They will --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- come to this house to me.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And then you gotta pay for travel costs also.
L:  Well that's true.
R:  You know?
L:  That's true.  And you pay to park if you're going into a big cineplex and the whole --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- the whole nine yards.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Just too much.  So when's the -- um, when's the -- how longer ago was last time you went?
L:  [SIGH] Actually the last time I saw a movie was Wednesday night.
R:  Ooh!
L:  And the only reason that I remember --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that is because we were on our honeymoon. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, wow!  Congratulations!
L:  Thank you, thank you!
R:  [SIGH] How long have you been married?
L:  Uh, a week ago yesterday. [LAUGH] 
R:  Congratulations!
L:  [LAUGH] Thank you.
R:  And the to -- the best to both of you.
L:  Oh, thank you very much.
R:  That's so nice! [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah, we had -- we -- ended up going to Toronto -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and we bought a -- a coupon book --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and it had coupons we could go to the movies, the t- tickets cost us four and a quarter apiece.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So we were able to go.  We went a couple of times and saw movies while we were out and just  [SIGH]  The first one we went to see, Anger Management, with --
R:  O- oh.
L:  -- Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler.
R:  Anger Management, how was that?
L:  I did not like it! [LAUGH] 
R:  You didn't.  What was it [NOISE] about?
L:  It is about a -- a young man who i- is always being walked, you know, he's just --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- very compliant, and his -- y- you find out in the end of the movie his girlfriend has hired somebody to help to stand up for himself.
R:  [SIGH] Oka- ... [MN] 
L:  But the way they do that is by making him mad!
R:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.
L:  And then they do these outrageous things to make this guy furious to the point where he finally just has to explode -- honestly!
R:  And -- and then he goes crazy?
L:  Yeah, just about.  I mean he -- he beats up his boss and it's -- [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.

L:  -- it's not a good thing --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I just -- I didn't like it.
R:  Boring.
L:  I didn't like how they went --
R:  Sounds kinda boring.
L:  -- about it.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah I didn't -- I didn't care for that one at all, and then we went to see -- we went to see X. Men Two. [MN] 
R:  Ooh! How was that?
L:  If you like action movies there's a lot of action in it.  I slept through some of it, but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I was tired and had taken a cold pill. [LAUGH] 
R:  There was no storyline, right?
L:  Not -- well a little bit.  If you saw the first one, um, this answers some questions that got left.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ah, so you really -- you  have to like X. Men, you know.  If you're not an X. Men fan you probably wouldn't enjoy it.
R:  Mm. [MN] [SIGH] 
L:  And, like I said, I slept through part of it but there were a couple of [LAUGH] extenuating circumstances for that! [MN] 
R:  Now, what was that karate movie where they were flying through the air?  Flying Tigers Hidden Dragons.
L:  Oh!  I -- you know --
R:  Yeah, I think was -- 
L:  -- haven't --
R:  Crouching Tiger, um, Hidden Dra- [NOISE] --
L:  Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.
R:  Right.  I didn't like all that flying they were doing.
L:  Oh!
R:  It was just too -- too movie like!
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN] Because I'm sitting here and they just put on Terminator Two, just now --
L:  Oh, okay!
R:  -- it just came on.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [SIGH] And I'm thinking like the kung fu and the karate that they do, I like that.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] But with, you know, [NOISE] the mechanics and, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's just --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you can go f- -- too far.
L:  Yeah.  Well, that's true. When they start --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- getting the computer generated 
R:  So I'm thinking of X. Men, when you say that, do they have all of that, you know, and I'm pretty sure they do.
L:  Um, not that I recall.  These were more they had -- you know, they had certain powers.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  Okay. [NOISE]
L:  -- one of the characters was able to teleport short distances.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  You know, so he could be in one place and decide he wanted to be, you know, across the street and down the road --
R:  Okay!
L:  -- and he'd just --
R:  He was --
L:  -- kind of --
R:  -- the bad one, right?
L:  -- blink . [SIGH]  You thought so but he turned out not to be. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, wow! Okay, okay.
L:  So -- oh, you know, so I -- I like going to the theater.  And there are some movies that I absolutely have to see in the theater first.
R:  I was thinking about going to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the theater tonight.
L:  Ooh!
R:  But I think we're going to go to a club instead. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well that sounds like fun. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Being that I'm alone with no children.
L:  [MN] Oh!
R:  Yeah, so ...
L:  Absolutely!
R:  Yeah, that's right.
L:  Absolutely, go out to have some fun!
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I haven't been out in a while.  My birthday was March thirty first --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- and I b- -- I wanted to go out the whole month of March and --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- I never went and now it's May --
L:  Oh! [LAUGH] 
R:  -- heading --
L:  It's, ah -- it's time to go.
R:  -- towards June --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and I'm realizing I still haven't been --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- anywhere! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Ramona, it's time --
R:  Birthday's gone --
L:  -- to go! [LAUGH]
R:  -- and everything else has gone -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and I still haven't been anywhere!
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But I do want to go to Chicago and, um, sit in the Jerry Springer's audience. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh! [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  We're gonna to go down there next month and sit in the Jerry Springer --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- audience and come back. [SIGH]
L:  -- my goodness!
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That would be an experience!
R:  Wouldn't it! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Who knows, maybe I can get some beads. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that -- that would be an experience!
R:  That's something! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, but the last movie I saw was -- let me think -- [MN] I Want To Be A Boiler.  I only saw half of it.  Matter of fact, it's in the VCR right now. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But I think it was supposed to be like a funny drama.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] And it was okay, it was okay.  It was about these kids, [SIGH] um, matter of fact this child, he doesn't seem to bad already --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but the mother -- he got suspended from school, and the mother's getting tired of it.  See she has to work --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- and she has three children and she's alone.  [SIGH] So she sends him to live with someone, and I see that this guy looks like he's a drug dealer.
L:  Oh dear!
R:  But it's -- I was just getting to the part where he moved in with him.
L:  Oh!
R:  And he's such a good little kid already now.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  [NOISE] So far.  I don't know why he got suspended --
L:  Huh!
R:  -- [SIGH] but he seems well mannered, you know --
L:  Mm!
R:  -- so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'm gonna see what happens.
L:  Mm!
R:  And that's last the last thing I was watching. [MN] [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, um, it started going towards, like, um -- ooh! He just threw him through the window!
L:  Oh my goodness!
R:  Uh-huh.  He's playing Terminator, that's what -- ooh!  Threw him on the stove -- the hot stove --
L:  Ooh! No!
R:  [SIGH] Ooh! This is something else! [NOISE]
L:  Poor little boy!
R:  Oh, he's a machine! [NOISE]
L:  Oh! Okay.
R:  Because I see where the man went to stab him and he didn't get stabbed.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [PAUSE] Oh, okay.
R:  Wow!  This is something else!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's a lot of action!
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Ooh!
L:  Yeah, there's a lot of action in the Terminator movies. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Did you see those? [NOISE]
L:  I have seen parts of them and I know --
R:  [SIGH] Me too. [NOISE]
L:  -- there's -- Terminator Three's coming out.
R:  Oh, it is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Are you sure it hasn't --
L:  It's coming out this summer. [NOISE]
R:  -- already? [LAUGH]
L:  No, it's due out in July, I believe.
R:  Oh, okay --
L:  Terminator Three is --
R:  -- so many of them.
L:  -- coming out.  Yeah, so, something new.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Something different.  I like -- I like to watch drama.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I try -- every now and again it's, like, I want a really good comedy.
R:  Right.  Okay.
L:  Do you think you could find a really good comedy any more?
R:  What about -- did you see Analyze This? [MN] 
L:  I saw that --
R:  And Analyze That.
L:  I saw Analyze This, I haven't seen Analyze That yet.
R:  [SIGH] But, what was Analyze This about?  Tell me please.
L:  Uh, Billy Crystal played a -- a psychiatrist and basically he had to deal with Robert de Niro, who was a gangster.
R:  [NOISE] Okay.
L:  And kind of help him deal with his anger [LAUGH] management issues. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, oh! [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] Why he wanted to whack people all the time. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, okay.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Was it funny?
L:  [SIGH] Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [MN] not terribly, you know.
R:  It was supposed to be funny.
L:  It was supposed to be.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It was supposed to be.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But y- you know I have the hardest time just finding a really good comedy that's not vulgar.
R:  Mm.
L:  You know it's --
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  I don't need all that cussing and -- and whatnot and, you know --
R:  Exactly!
L:  -- throwing people downstairs to be funny.
R:  Right, like --
L:  You know?
R:  -- Jackass.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I would not watch it.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  My friend w-  -- as a matter of fact my friend watched it last night --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] and -- yesterday afternoon and I did -- I did not want to see it.
L:  Right.
R:  I said, "No, that's all right, I don't think I want to see ..." [MN] first of all it's disgusting [NOISE] from --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- what I heard.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I do not wanna watch a funny, disgusting movie because I don't find disgusting funny.
L:  Exactly, exactly!
R:  [SIGH] You know, I don't find them funny where they think it's funny but, um, [SIGH] I guess it had its funny moments.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But the disgusting parts I could do without.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  You know, [SIGH] and now usually what I'll do, I'll watch sitcoms at night.
L:  Okay!  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And, um, I usually go for the funny ones, not the dramas.
L:  Right, [NOISE] right.
R:  Now, what do you usually go for at night? [NOISE]
L:  Oh! [SIGH] I'd watch --
R:  Well, I'd think you're husband basically. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, well [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] You're newly weds! 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yay for the newly weds!
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Hey! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, we're just coming off our honeymoon.
R:  Great!
L:  So. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, but yeah what -- 
R:  [LAUGH] Wrong question! 
L:  [LAUGH] when we watch TV! [LAUGH]  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh!  No we -- we like to watch sci fi actually. 
R:  I love sci fi channel.
L:  Um, we like, um 
R:  Mhm.
L:  He's -- he's getting me into Farscape.
R:  [SIGH] Fa- -- oh?
L:  Which is -- I s- -- I can't -- [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- quite wrap my mind around a biological entity, because the ship on Farscape is a -- is a -- a biological being --
R:  Okay. [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] that allows people to live inside it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and operate it.
R:  Okay.
L:  I'm like, this doesn't make sense to me. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Okay, well it's --
L:  [LAUGH] [inaudible]
R:  -- sci fi, you know that.
L:  Yeah, yeah!
R:  That's excitement. [NOISE]
L:  So we -- you know, we like um, [NOISE] -- [MN] we like science fiction so we love the Lord of the Rings, you know, the movies.
R:  [SIGH] You know, the copy that I did see of that, it was very unclear. [SIGH]
L:  Oh!
R:  It was just annoying and --
L:  Oh, you have [NOISE] --
R:  -- I watched the whole thing but --
L:  --to see a clear one.
R:  -- I couldn't hear it, I could barely see it.
L:  Oh, you have to rent it again and get a good one. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, because that [NOISE] seems the type of movie I could go for.
L:  That is -- it is just an awesome movie. And --
R:  Really!
L:  -- we [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we saw the second one in the theater.
R:  [MN] 
L:  And that's -- that's one of those that I have to go to the theater to see to start.
R:  [NOISE] Okay.
L:  You know, so you get the whole surround sound and the big screen and the whole, you know. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And so -- in fact I own the first one and I want to get the second one, as soon as it comes available on DVD --

R:  You -- but you saw th-
