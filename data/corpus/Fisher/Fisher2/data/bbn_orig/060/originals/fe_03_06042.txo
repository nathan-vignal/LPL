L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, I'm Sian.
L:  I'm Sandy.
R:  Hi, Sandy.
L:  Hi.
R:  [LAUGH]  Okay.  As far as going to the movies, I don't go too much.
L:  I don't either --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- they've hit the wrong crowd with this one, haven't they?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I mainly um, well, we mainly buy a lot of movies [NOISE]
L:  Kids movies or just movie movies?
R:  Most of the time.
L:  Yeah.  We um, we purchase all of the Disney movies of course because the kids want those --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and then we purchased some of the um other movies um [LIPSMACK] -- not a lot, but I mean you know, one every couple of months or so.
R:  Yeah.  Well, we purchase more than that.
L:  Do you really?
R:  Yeah.  At least like five a month.
L:  Really?  Wow.  Where do you -- where do you get them?
R:  Most of the time we get them from Columbia House or FYE.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And um, just rent a lot of main -- I mean, buy a lot of D- -- DVDs and stuff like that.  Well, soon we'll be buying probably the whole Disney collection like you [LAUGH].
L:  Right.
R:  But my daughter's only one, so ...
L:  Oh yeah, but she's still got to have 'em [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  She's only into Elmo right now [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And --
L:  That's a phase though, she'll -- she'll get into more.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  My son went through the Elmo phase and now he thinks he's just totally stupid.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But -- but we did Elmo movies for a long time, we did all of those um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- those ah videos that you do the baby talk videos --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and um then we moved on.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And Disney, I mean we can watch it nine hundred times and still be interested, sit here and watch it.  
R:  Okay.
L:  So, she'll get to that point.  So, you guys don't go out --
R:  And I'm trying to think of -- think of what the last movie was that I saw in the theater.
L:  I was trying to think, too, when they said --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- what was the last movie you went to.  It's been several months.
R:  It's been like over a year.
L:  And I went with a girlfriend.  It may have been the Ya Ya Sisterhood.  I don't remember --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I may have seen --
R:  I want to see that movie so bad.
L:  Oh, it was so cute.  It's a good one.
R:  [NOISE] I think that'll be one I have to buy.
L:  Yeah.  That's -- that's one I'm going to buy, I'm sure.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It was good.
R:  Last thing I saw in the movies I think was Scorpion King.
L:  It was what now?
R:  Scorpion King --
L:  Oh, I don't even know --
R:  -- part two of um -- gosh, I forgot the name of the movie now [NOISE].  I can't even think of the name of the movie.
L:  So, what kind of movies do you enjoy?
R:  Um, all kinds.
L:  Really?  I -- I don't like --
R:  Horrors --
L:  -- um the science fiction movies too much.  My husband likes them, but I don't care --
R:  I like those.
L:  And --
R:  And I like romances [LAUGH].
L:  I -- I really prefer like a comedy or a romance.
R:  Yeah.  Like comedy, romance, drama, horror, science fiction --
L:  Oh, I can't stand horror [LAUGH].
R:  Children's [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  I can't stand the horror ones.  I don't like to even rent those.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH].
L:  I remember --
R:  I l- --
L:  -- my husband and I rented -- and this has been years ago, this'll tell you -- Fatal Attraction --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we didn't see it at the theater, but we rented it and I was scared to go to the bathroom, I mean I just -- it just freaks me out, I -- I do not like that kind of movie [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]  I don't think --
L:  I guess I take it too --
R:  -- Fatal Attraction was meant to be scary that much.
L:  I -- I guess I take it too literally or something --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I just, you know?
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Just too afraid of those.
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  So, um, you guys don't get out much either, though, because of the -- the daughter or ...?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  She's only one.
L:  Did you -- did you go m- -- much before that?
R:  Um, well we used to go like every month --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- or every like twice a month --
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  So, we --
L:  We used to have a Monday night date at the ah dollar theater --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah before kids and we would go every Monday night and see a different movie.  We'd come in and have a quick dinner and then go --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- see a dollar movie which was really neat ah because you don't have to pay quite as much --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and that was neat, but after kids --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- your priorities change so much --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, our dollar movies, they went up to like one seventy five.
L:  Oh, you're kidding!
R:  I used to go a lot --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I think they're probably two dollars now.
L:  Oh, you're kidding.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know how much ours are, they're probably a dollar fifty now, but um [LIPSMACK] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like I say, this was years ago because my oldest child is ten, so [LAUGH].
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  So, we used to go a lot in the old days, but recently --
R:  The drive in.
L:  Yeah.  Recently I've been with some girls from the church -- they try to get a thing together every now and then on a Friday night and go -- but we haven't done that in --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- four or five months
R:  [NOISE] Mm.
L:  It's just hard to get a group together to go or to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to find time.  First of all, I don't want to pay a babysitter --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then have to pay the cost to go into a movie too, on a Friday or a Saturday night.
R:  So --
L:  Because that gets expensive.
R:  They haven't really brought any good movies out lately.
L:  No, I don't think so either.
R:  No, everything has been mostly action [NOISE] [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, and like what's playing right now?  Something I saw, oh goodness, I can't even remember --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a preview last night and I'm like there's no way I'd even want to see that.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And they were asking some of the people that had been to see it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- what is it, oh gosh, I don't even want to say it --
R:  Matrix.
L:  Matrix.  That's it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They --
R:  I knew it.
L:  -- had asked some of the people that had come out of that movie yesterday and all the women went, "Oh, it's a guy movie" --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and then one of the guys said, "Well, it was hard to pay attention to it.  It was hard to -- to follow what was going on" he said, "But I'll -- I'll come back and see it like three or four more times and I'll figure out" --
R:  [LAUGH]  And pay full price?
L:  And I'm like, what is -- what's the point?  I mean w- -- [LAUGH].
R:  [NOISE] Should just wait till it comes --
L:  Why do you want to --
R:  -- out and buy it.
L:  -- go to something.  Yeah.  I mean, why would you want to go to something like that, even if the guy, I mean, you know, the girls going, "Oh, it's definitely a guy movie" --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but the guy comes out and says, "I had a little trouble following it, I couldn't figure out what was going on" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't think I'd be inclined to go back.
R:  Well, I liked the first Matrix.  I don't know about the second one yet, though.
L:  Yeah.  Well, they say you've got to see the third one before you really understand what's going on.  Is that -- is that true?  Or do you know?
R:  [NOISE] I don't really know --
L:  That's what it was s- --
R:  -- well the first one explained a lot to me, though.
L:  Really?  That's what they were saying last night, is that you've got to see the third one before you understand what's going on.
R:  Mm.  That don't help a lot.
L:  Uh-uh.  I mean, I just -- I'm too impatient for that [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, now they've got to bringing out the movies and um like um three movies, they'll bring them out a year apart like they're doing um what is that Lord of the Rings.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] They'll bring it out in -- the third one'll be the first one.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And the first one'll be the second one [LAUGH].
L:  I have trouble with that.  I don't know if I just don't think straight or what [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Those kind of confuse me sometimes, too.
L:  Yeah.  I need a complete story when I'm sitting there.  I -- you know ... 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's not something I can -- I can do backwards or that I can wait three years for a sequel.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  When you pay that much money, you want to know how it ends.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And unfortunately, I'm one of these that wants it to end on a good note [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]  I think they just want more money.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They bring 'em in -- bring 'em out out of order so they can just say, "Okay, well I saw this one, I have to go see the other one".
L:  Well, that's true.  I mean, it does force you to go back.  There's some truth in that.  Or either to buy it.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, there is some truth in that, definitely.
R:  And buying box sets costs more than just one.
L:  Yeah.  So, how often do you guys watch 'em at home.
R:  Oh, at home we watch 'em like every other night.
L:  Do you, as I mean, well your daughter's too young, but you and your husband watch them together?
R:  Yeah.  My daughter, every day she watches Elmo.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Elmo in Grouchland.
L:  I think that's cool.  I li- -- I -- I do.
R:  [LAUGH]  I'm trying to find her some more movies, though.
L:  Well, those ah -- like I say, those Babytalk videos were real good for us --
R:  Well, they have some um Fisher Price --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- like Little People movies.
L:  Yeah?  I never saw any of those.
R:  She watches it.  It's kind of like the little [inaudible] like with um Rudolph and stuff --
L:  Uh-huh.  Right.
R:  Well, they're cute, but --
L:  So, she gets into that?  We um --
R:  Not -- not as much as Elmo.
L:  The ones -- my kids did those Babytalk ones because it had a lot of singing in it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they always -- the music always intrigued them.  They would -- they would ah be attracted to it or drawn to it because of the music and the singing.
R:  Well, I'll have to look up those.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've never even -- I never really heard of them.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I hadn't either, but I got one free ah through some kind of baby rebate, you know, I was big into doing a rebate --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and through one of the rebates I got my first one and then like I went to Toys R Us and picked up some extra ones after I found out that my daughter liked 'em and um [LIPSMACK] they really are kinda cute little singalong things for 'em.
R:  Oh, I might get her that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They have like complete b- --
L:  But Elmo's cool.  I -- I've got this Elmo right now that I -- I guess I'm going to yard sale.  He sits just as tall as I do on the floor, that we bought my son when he was in his Elmo phase.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  And now he goes, "Elmo who?" [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]  They get older, they forget about him.  My cousin went through a Barney phase.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  Now he hates Barney [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  My kids went through a Barney phase too and they all deny it adamantly right now.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  There was never any Barney in their life.  Okay [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They get to the phase they're very embarrassed by that.  I don't think they're ever embarrassed by Elmo, though.
R:  Ah.
L:  They don't deny him.  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Goodness.  So, you guys
