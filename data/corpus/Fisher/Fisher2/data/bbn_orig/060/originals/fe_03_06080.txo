L:  [NOISE] Erica.
R:  Hello, this is Sheryl.
L:  [NOISE] Hello, this is Erica.
R:  Hi, nice to meet you.
L:  [LAUGH] Hi.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Do you play computer games?
R:  Ye- -- in fact -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I'm playing as we speak.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, what do you play?
R:  I play on line and I play Dominos and Hammerhead Pool.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, I play the, um, I mean -- well, when I am -- when I have the time --  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I play -- I play, ah, the, ah, Beijing Tile [NOISE], Dam[?] Chong[?] -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- Tile game.
R:  Oh, I've never heard that.
L:  Oh.  Well [NOISE]  
R:  Where is that -- 
L:  It's -- it's -- 
R:  -- located.
L:  -- totally addictive.  Ah, there's now a [NOISE] [inaudible] -- there's a site called World Winner dot com.  [NOISE] And, ah --  
R:  Okay.
L:  -- they have --
R:  [several inaudible words] 
L:  -- you can play for money or you can just play for free, um -- 
R:  Oh, okay -- 
L:  -- they have practice games.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- you ever been to Pogo?
L:  Ah, no I've seen it.  I went there for my daughter.  I have a young child and I've take -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I've gone to that site for her but I've never gone for me.  I got -- [NOISE] got hooked on this one and I have so little time to play -- 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- that it's the one I play as much as I can.  [NOISE]  What is -- what'd you say?  You have Hammerhead what?
R:  Hammerhead Pool.  It's in Pogo.
L:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  And it's just like playing eight -- it's -- it's eight.  Well, you can play either eight ball or nine ball.  It's really -- 
L:  I see. 
R:  -- fun.
L:  It's like -- 
R:  It's -- I've -- I've -- 
L:  Play -- 
R:  I have -- 
L:  -- pool on the computer.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh.
R:  You have -- you'll have to check it out sometime.  It's addicting, I can tell you that.
L:  Gee, now, that's how I feel about the -- the Mahjong Tile games.  I, um -- oh, gosh there's a -- shoo -- um, I, ah -- I'm -- I'm a predominately stay at home mom.  I found personally that, um, you know, playing those games kind of gave me some mental stimulation sometimes.
R:  They sure do.
L:  Do you, um -- do you, ah, ever -- do you ha- -- do you just sit and play them or do you, ah, watch TV or -- 
R:  While the TV is on but -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  When I'm at -- 
L:  Just a -- 
R:  -- my computer, it's like everything around me is blocked out.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Which is -- 
L:  Have you ever -- have you -- a- -- do you have to pay to play the game or is it a free?
R:  No.  No.  Ah, it's all free.  In fact I've joined, um, leagues on here and that's all free.
L:  That's cool.
R:  And you earn, ah, what they call bux.  B.U.X. and then you let them build up and you -- you can buy different things. 
L:  Wow.
R:  It -- it's a lot of fun.  You meet a lot of -- I've met a lot of nice people.
L:  Oh.  So, do they have a -- ad- advertisers that are -- 
R:  No, what you do is just -- 
L:  -- pop ups or whatever?
R:  -- go to, um, go to Pogo and go to Dominos and just pick a room.  There's lots of rooms.  Each room has different leagues -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and, um, it -- it's all really fun.  They tell you who you play, what game you play.  It's really, really fun.
L:  Oh.
R:  And I've only been playing it on the league for a week.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I've [several inaudible words] just come in here sitting down doing -- 
L:  Have you ever -- 
R:  -- around with the different games.
L:  Have you tried any games that are, um, just like CD rom games versus internet?
R:  Oh, I've got a couple.  They're for the kids.  You know, the -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- smaller ones.
L:  'Cause I -- I went and bought the, um, I went and bought the CD rom version of the game that I like so much though.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Um, the Mahjong Tiles and I -- I don't enjoy it as much because I'm not competing -- 
R:  You don't have the -- 
L:  -- against anyone.
R:  -- right.  I was going to say you don't have the interaction.
L:  It actually -- it -- and when I play, you don't really.  You just have -- you just see your score and their score.  You don't really have -- I think they do have chat rooms and stuff, but -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but you don't -- you play individually.  You play on your own, because it is a Solitaire -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  And then -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- when you're done, you know, you see your score and h- -- you know, the other scores depending on whether you're playing one on one or in a group of four.  So, you don't ever really have any idea of the person that you're playing against, who they are.  Um, and I've often thought, "Gee I wonder who this one person is that --" 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know, that beats -- 
R:  Well, that's just like [inaudible].
L:  "-- me on occasion".  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  You know, I'm sitting here playing and I'm -- you know, you chat back and forth, but you really don't know -- they could -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- tell you that they're a woman and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah but you really don't know unless you -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- see for yourself.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Did you -- you do -- is it like an instant message on there or is it just -- 
R:  Well, they -- 
L:  -- like a [several inaudible words]?
R:  -- when you go to the, ah -- when you go to the room, it comes with a little chat box and you can chat while you play.  Oh, God --  
L:  Oh.
R:  -- they've got Euka[?] and Spades and Hearts and -- 
L:  Oh, I've never played Euka.  I've heard of some games.
R:  Oh, [MN] -- 
L:  Well, Spades -- 
R:  -- I'm add- -- 
L:  -- now, Spades I love.
R:  Oh, Lord, yeah, they got s- Spade leagues too that you can -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- get into.
L:  See, when I was younger and -- and childless, I used to -- that was our -- 
R:  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  -- big weekend thing.  We would sit around and play Spades for hours and hours and hours.
R:  Oh.
L:  We -- we cursed anyone who got a date, so that -- 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- they wouldn't -- we needed a fourth if someone had a date.  But, I, ah, ju- -- oh, the one on line one originally when you first got World Winner I told you about.  When you -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- first sign up they give you, like, so much money credit to get you -- 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- kind of hooked into playing for money.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then, um, after you win a certain amount, then they -- you're first to move up.  Um, you -- you're no longer a rookie and you can't play in the rookie free games anymore.
R:  Oh, then -- 
L:  And so that was --
R:  -- you've got to start paying.
L:  And you have to pay.  Well, you don't have to play for money.  They'll still let you play the free games, but you have to register and you have to put some money on account.  Now, you can never use it but you have to put it on account and, um, you know, you don't have to bet it but you have to have it there.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And, um, eventually -- you know, I played for quite a while and then all of a sudden it said, you know, you've lost your rookie status, you know?  And then when I -- well, this is the part that killed me.  I live in Arizona.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And when I went to put money in to -- so that I could, you know, play in the next ranking, because Arizona doesn't allow you [LAUGH] to play games for money on line -- 
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- and so they [NOISE] -- it's illegal for them to take my money.  So, they said, "Sorry, you can't do this anymore".  I was like, "Oh, man, they got me totally addicted and then cut me off.  Yes, Kristin, you may.  [NOISE] Sorry, my daughter's, ah, [NOISE] held up on me here.
R:  [LAUGH] How old is she?
L:  She's -- she's six.  Huh.  'Cause she's the reason I don't get to play much.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.
L:  Oh.  [NOISE] [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, I did go on Pogo once 'cause they -- I know they had children's games there too and I know that she found a -- a memory game.  But, she's -- she's not into it.  You know, she's [NOISE] -- she's much more -- she would rather play, you know, with her friends but -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, you get to a -- 
R:  Well, I have a thirteen year old that -- 
L:  -- to be a little bit older and you don't have friends accessible to you at all times like kids do -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- so, [NOISE] do you work outside of the home?
R:  No.  No, I don't.
L:  So, you -- 
R:  No.  I'm home -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I got a -- a five -- 
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- year old son.  He just turned five and then my daughter's thirteen.
L:  Oh.  So, you have a little one too.  So you know what I mean.
R:  Oh, Lord.  Yeah, and he starts -- 
L:  They're -- 
R:  -- kindergarten in the fall so -- 
L:  Yeah, my girl's in the -- 
R:  -- that's, um -- 
L:  -- first grade.
R:  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  I -- I'm getting traumatized.  Yes, but -- 
R:  [several inaudible words] 
L:  -- I'll have more time then.
R:  Yeah, it'll just give us --
L:  I'll have more time for the games.
R:  -- peace [several inaudible words].  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  But, [SIGH] [NOISE] I, um, and I used -- 
R:  How long you been -- 
L:  -- to [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  -- doing this?
L:  You know, I started probably about six months' ago, started playing -- 
R:  Me to.
L:  -- games on line.  And, um, I -- I used to think it was just teenage boys that played these, you know, computer games but now I know how easily -- how easy it is to find one that appeals to you and you --  
R:  Well, I play, ah -- 
L:  -- become addicted.
R:  I prefer Pogo over Yahoo.  Ah, Yahoo's games I don't like.
L:  Yeah, I have -- I haven't -- 
R:  I find them confusing.
L:  Oh, I don't -- I don't know.  I -- I -- this is really the only one that, you know -- 
R:  I'm in a -- 
L:  -- whatever reasons caught me and -- 
R:  I wrote it down.  I'm going to check it out.  [LAUGH] It's probably --
L:  I -- I -- 
R:  -- another addiction for me.
L:  Ah, there's a whole bunch of them.  They have a different one.  I know my niece is -- she really likes the Tile.  She plays.  But, they have different versions.  They have one that's like a Los Vegas Tile.  The one I play which is called the Beijing Tile, it's kind of like they use the Mahjong Tiles.  It's -- it's kind of like a deck of cards [several inaudible words].  Um, there's, ah, four of every number -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and design.  They have different designs.  They have like, you know, bamboo shoots and they'll have one bamboo shoot, two bamboo shoots all the way up and then they have, um, the seasons which is spring, summer and fall and you have to click on two that are matching and to remove them from the way they've, um, stacked them.  And the object is to -- to get rid of all the tiles.  And -- but, sometimes like a two bamboo may be stuck on top of a two bamboo and so if you haven't used one of the other two to release it, the game can be -- you can get to the very end and have two on top of each other and you can't -- 
R:  Oh, great.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  -- do a thing.  You have to start over.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, its, um, yeah, somewhat luck and somewhat skill and how fast you get to recognizing.  When I first --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- started, the fact that the winter and spring, summer and fall --
