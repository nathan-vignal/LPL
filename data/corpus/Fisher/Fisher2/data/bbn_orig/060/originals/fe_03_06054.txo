R:  Oh, you don't like movies.

R:  You just don't have time --
L:  I have two small children so I hardly-- you know, I haven't had time to go to the movies --
R:  I see.
L:  -- but I'm trying to think, um, [MN].  When I see them I can't remember what they are, that's the terrible thing [LAUGH].
R:  You didn't get to see Chicago?
L:  Oh, yes.  I did see Chicago.
R:  See.
L:  That was good.  That was very --
R:  Did you like that?  I liked it very much.
L:  I liked it very much too.  It was very good.  My husband, on the other hand, didn't like it because he --
R:  No?
L:  -- wasn't into the dancing as much.
R:  The musicals.  No.
L:  Yeah, it was a musical.
R:  Men, yeah men --

R:  Oh, I thought she was wonderful and I thought, uh, Catherine Zeta Jones was very good also.

R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Queen -- was it Queen Latifah?
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

L:  Oh, I think we are.
R:  Oh, good.  Where are you from?
L:  I'm from New Jersey.
R:  Oh, we're, uh, in New York.
L:  Oh, okay [NOISE].
R:  Not in New York City.  We're -- we're, uh, upstate new York.
L:  Oh, upstate New York.  By like Goshen and that area?
R:  Uh, by -- I beg your pardon?
L:  By Goshen in that --
R:  Oh, no.  Goshen would be Hudson Valley.
L:  Oh.
R:  We're Rochester and Buffalo.
L:  Oh, nice.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, that's -- that's where you get all the snow.
R:  Oh, that we did.
L:  Yes.
R:  Yes.  All right --
L:  So, do you like to rent, uh, videos or no --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- as much?
R:  Uh, well, now what was the video I saw the other -- I did get one.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, what was that?  Sweet Home Alabama?
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Did you see that one?
L:  No, I never saw that one.
R:  All right, that was cute.
L:  That was cute?
R:  Yeah, that one was cute.
L:  Yeah, I, um, I haven't seen, uh, much on video because my kids usually get the video.
R:  Sure, your kids usually get the videos --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and watch the TV and then --
L:  yeah, yeah.
R:  -- when -- when they're through, you're dead tired.
L:  Exactly, exactly.
R:  Yes, I've been there.  A long time ago but I've been there.
L:  Yep, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So ...
R:  You know, so I don't know.  So, then you saw Chicago and --
L:  Yeah, I saw Chicago.
R:  -- we saw Sweet Alabama.
L:  And I was thinking about, um, what other movie I saw.  It was something cute.  It was a girlie one with all -- I went with, um, my sister.
R:  Oh.
L:  Oh, I can't remember.
R:  What was, uh --
L:  I can't remember.
R:  It wasn't the one about all the sisters.  
L:  Yeah.  Uh, Ya Ya Sisterhood.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yes, yes, yes.  I saw that.
L:  Oh you --
R:  That was good.
L:  Yeah, that was cute too.
R:  You know, I -- I liked that one, no.  No.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, uh, the one problem I have in movies --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- is they're too loud.
L:  Yeah, they are too loud.
R:  Now, uh --
L:  In the movie theater, you mean?
R:  In the movie theater.
L:  Yeah, people talk --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it's so expensive now.  It's unbelievable.  By the time you pay to get in and then the popcorn and the soda.
R:  Oh, you buy that popcorn.  It -- it's --
L:  It's unbelievable.
R:  -- four fifty.
L:  Yeah, its ridiculous --
R:  No, no, no --
L:  -- for that sort of thing.
R:  -- it -- it really is too much money.
L:  I mean, it's --
R:  No.
L:  -- just -- you know, you can do it once in a while but -- and especially with the kids.
R:  I know.
L:  Like I can't take -- well, all four of us.  I mean, we -- we go every now and then but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it has to be something really good [LAUGH].
R:  Right.
L:  I just don't like going to the, uh, like -- I like different types of movies than my husband although we both like kind of action movies.
R:  Oh, do you like them?
L:  Yeah, yeah.  We like the action.
R:  I like the English melodrama or I like the -- uh, what were the -- all those English ones that were out for a while?  The English -- what, the English --
L:  Um, uh, the British ones.  I'm trying to think.
R:  Yes, what -- what was her name?  Oh, you know.
L:  Uh --
R:  In -- in the one that played that -- that terrible, uh, part -- was it Hannibal?
L:  Oh, Hannibal.
R:  And what was his name?
L:  Oh, his name.  Oh, I don't remember his name but --
R:  You know, he's a great actor.
L:  Oh, Jodie Foster.
R:  Yes, and what was the male part though?
L:  The male, oh.
R:  Oh, you know.  He's a great British actor.
L:  [MN] I know but I --
R:  And I think he's even a sir now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Anthony Hopkins.
L:  Anthony Hopkins, of course.
R:  Yes, it came.
L:  Yes, now that we say it, I know it but --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- it some -- I really don't have a good memory when it comes to movies --
R:  To movies.
L:  -- but my husband loves -- he can -- he can tell you every word of, like, the go- The Goodfellas and all of those.
R:  All of those.
L:  He knows them -- he knows them by heart but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I just don't -- I guess I don't have that interest.
R:  Yeah, did you like movies when you were a young girl before being married or what not?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  You did?
L:  I like them but I was never a real TV buff.  You know, I never really sat --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- down and watched TV much.
R:  See, uh --
L:  He's more of a, uh, yeah sports person.
R:  How old are you there?
L:  I'm forty.  I just turned forty.
R:  I'm seventy three.
L:  Oh, God bless you.  That's great.
R:  But you see in my day [LAUGH] --
L:  Right, it was a different whole type of movie.
R:  Yeah, but you see you'd go out with the girls on Saturday night and the thing would be to go out to dinner --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- then you'd go to a movie --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and then after the movie you went to the ice cream parlor and you had a soda, you had something.
L:  Right, that's nice.
R:  And it was great fun --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and I did enjoy the movies.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And when we were younger, the -- you -- what, they changed the movies three times a week.
L:  A week, right, because they -- and you know, everybody went.
R:  Do you remember that?
L:  Yeah, well I know that --
R:  No, you can't remember but you know.
L:  -- my mother --
R:  Your mother --
L:  -- had told me about that and my older --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- sister used to go to the drive -- drive in sometimes.
R:  That's right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right, right.
L:  And the drive ins were fun, to be able to -- to just to do something different for a change, you know.
R:  I have a set of glasses --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- blue stemmed glasses.
L:  Oh.
R:  I have the champagne, I have the water glass, I have the goblet, I have the sherbet and it all came from the movies.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  You would go on Wednesday nights and with your ticket you would pay an extra quarter --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and you'd get a glass.
L:  Wow.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] That's great.  That might be worth something, you never know.  I mean, they're old.
R:  I have seen them in the ant- when I -- when the -- sometimes when the antique dealers are in the malls --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- set up, I have seen them there --
L:  Oh, that's great.
R:  -- and they have --
L:  My grandmother is ninety two --
R:  Is she?
L:  -- and she's still living and down in Tom's River.  Thank God she's able to do stuff for herself and she, um, she used to live in, um, Palisades[?] Park which is right over the bridge from New -- New York.
R:  Yes, yes, I know.
L:  And she would, uh -- she -- she has a picture of herself with, like, the movie people.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Like, because, you know, like they were all very big, important --
R:  She could tell you stories --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- about going to the movies --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- and getting dishes and glasses I'm sure.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I got to ask her about that.
R:  How about your Mum?
L:  My Mum is sixty seven so, um --
R:  And she also -- is she from --
L:  She probably wouldn't know.
R:  -- Jersey?
L:  Yes, she's from Jersey too, yeah.
R:  Oh, I'm sure she'd be able to tell you about that.
L:  Oh, wow.  That -- was that just at --
R:  Movies --
L:  -- the drive ins or the regular?
R:  Oh, no.  This was the --
L:  Oh, the regular.
R:  -- little movies that used to be in your neighborhood.
L:  Oh, right.
R:  Well, we had neighborhood movie theaters.
L:  Yeah, we had one too and I -- the town that I grew up in Bergenfield that a little town, um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- movie theater and they're all getting sold out now because they can't keep up with these big [inaudible].
R:  Oh, no.  you -- they can't keep up with those.
L:  I know.
R:  In fact, we don't have, uh -- we don't have any left.
L:  Oh, that's --
R:  We have, uh, a little artsy one.  It's called the Little[?] and it's downtown and it shows the art, entertainment type pictures which is very nice.
L:  Right, like we have Windsor School and they do -- uh, they were doing, um -- what did they do?  They did, uh, Les, um, Les Mis and like they did Cinderella --
R:  Right.
L:  -- for the kids, Sleeping Beauty.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Put on like a little play which is nice.
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know --
L:  It's nice for the kids to see that, you know.  I -- I used to go into New York to see them plays but now even that's too expensive.
R:  Oh, my, no.
L:  By the time you drive -- well you take the ferry, which they've upped the price of the ferry now to like I think ten dollars round -- round trip.
R:  Mhm.
L:  so that's -- two -- two people would be twenty.  You know, and that's just to get there and --
R:  No, it -- it, uh -- you know, it amazes me sometimes when we are out --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I see all these young couples with, you know, with their children and they're out to dinner and, you know, and I look at our check and we're just two people and our check is thirty some odd dollars and I'm saying, "Joe, it's costing these kids fifty dollars to go out to dinner".
L:  Dinner, I know.  It's -- it's just unbelievable.
R:  No.
L:  It's just too much.  You can't -- you have to do it on special occasions.
R:  I know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know.
L:  Yeah, so.  Is this the first time you're doing this call?
R:  Yes, this is --
L:  Me too.
R:  -- the very first one.  You too?
L:  Me too, yeah.  They call me a couple of times but I couldn't pick up the phone when they called me.
R:  I see.
L:  So, now --
R:  No, I chose this Saturday and Sunday at night 'cause --
L:  Yes, that's smarter.  I -- I did it during the week too but it -- I -- I don't know if I should have done it [NOISE] during the week.  Oops, there goes my dog.
R:  Is that your dog?  What do you have?
L:  Yeah, I have a little shih-tzu.
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  Two little shih-tzu.  They're cute.
R:  Yes, I know.  We have a --
L:  But they -- but they're a lot of work as far as taking care of them.
R:  Why?
L:  Well, you take them to the groomer but then their ears get a real --
R:  I know, I have a --
L:  -- problem.
R:  -- cocker spaniel.
L:  And their skins gets -- has problems.
R:  That's right.  That's the --
L:  So, it --
R:  -- cocker also.

R:  I know.
L:  Well, the one dog I had to give like prednisone pills and this other kind of skin med- skin pills.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  They were like a hundred and fifty dollars for these pills.
R:  I know.
L:  Unbelievable [LAUGH].
R:  No, no, it's, uh --
L:  Sometimes --
R:  No, it's --
L:  That's another -- but you love 'em too.  They -- they're --
R:  Oh, gosh yes.
L:  -- so good, you know.
R:  No, I know that.
L:  My one dog sat underneath my daughter's crib when she was young and she -- he just protected her -- like he would protect her.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, you know, it's nice to -- to have --
R:  No, they're -- you -- you can't, uh, you know -- their value is --
L:  Is un- it's like a part of the family.
R:  Yes. 
L:  Yeah.
