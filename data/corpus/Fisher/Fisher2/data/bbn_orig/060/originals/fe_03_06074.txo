R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  My name is Robert.
R:  How are you doing today Robert?
L:  I'm fine.  How're you doing?
R:  Just fine thank you.
L:  Who are you?
R:  My name is Samara.
L:  Hi Samara.  I don't play computer games.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Neither do I.
L:  I don't know how we got this topic but, um, [MN] if you did play a computer game, what would it be?
R:  You know, I have no idea -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- simply because I have very little patience -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- for playing games like that.
L:  Me too.
R:  I've never really been good with them and to get a hang of it.  I do better with interactive material -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- than I do, ah, with games.  I also have, ah, I guess as a school teacher I really and truthfully have a problem with it because I see how those games have really and truthfully dulled the senses of young people.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because they don't have a chance to really give any feedback or to talk with anyone or -- they more or less set the tone for very antisocial behaviour to me.
L:  What if it was an intellectual computer game, one that enhanced certain social and academic skills?
R:  Could you give me an example?
L:  One where -- well, a game based on Hooked on Phonics an adult's Hooked on Phonics game.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Or an adult's Scrabble or an adult's investment game.
R:  Well, I guess really and truthfully I just can't envision playing those games alone.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  It -- it's really kind of hard.  I know -- well you -- Hooked on Phonics really and truthfully is not a game as much as a learning -- 
L:  I know, what I'm saying is that it is -- is like taking something [several inaudible words] education and adding -- an -- an -- an -- an aspect of entertainment to it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, it's really educational under the disguise of entertainment to kind of stimulate, you know? 
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  You know, that -- that's it.  So, in that regard it could possibly work.
R:  Mhm.
L:  If you know what I'm saying.
R:  Ah, I'm -- 
L:  Because I play -- I have a girlfriend who plays Scrabble and since she's been doing that her +vocabulary -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  It has, I mean, you know, she has [several inaudible words] keep out of playing Scrabble on line separate from playing Scrabble with her -- with -- with like a group of four.
R:  And maybe I'm just a fuddy-duddy because when I think of the computer, all I can think of doing is work.
L:  Work, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know of, ah, work and I -- when it comes down to investments, I really want to talk to somebody about my money.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, but that is certainly something to think about and it brings a new dimension to the whole concept, you know, of playing games.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And maybe I have a wrong way of looking at it -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- may -- you know, play -- 
L:  Because not all games are -- are [MN] primarily a waste of time and -- and -- and -- not they're just saying that they are but -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- there are games that are actually educational under the disguise -- 
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- of entertainment.
R:  Exactly.  And play is very important to growth and learning. 
L:  Exactly.  It is.
R:  It's -- it's very important.  So -- 
L:  Because when you're having fun --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, you spend -- 
R:  So, it is another -- 
L:  -- more time -- 
R:  -- way of looking at it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, a very good, you know, doing that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I guess the question becomes is how do you deem, you know, what would you deem is entertainment?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So -- 
L:  Well, entertainment takes all forms, I guess.
R:  Yes.  Yes, it does.  Yes, it does.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, [SIGH] also, I guess, it's just a matter of getting [inaudible] a per- -- I'm sure that, for my part, it has been a very big challenge and it has turned out to be rewarding in terms of using the computer.
L:  Mm.  So -- 
R:  I guess, maybe -- 
L:  -- tell me something you've never been bored, [several inaudible words] machine and you, like, go and play Solitaire or anything like that?
R:  No.  Mm mm.
L:  Never?
R:  Mm mm.
L:  Whoa.
R:  I don't know how to play Solitaire.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And maybe that could be one of the inhibitions too is just not knowing how to play a game.
L:  You -- yeah, that -- that -- well, that -- that -- there -- there it is right there.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean -- 
R:  Oh, yeah.  So, I play -- well, do you play that on your machine?
L:  Yeah.  If I'm on the train and I have my laptop and I'm bored 'cause sometimes I write and I will carry my machine with me and if I'm bored, you -- you know, [several inaudible words] knocking on -- you're not in the mood to put anything down, then I go switch over and I might play Solitaire.  I might play a little, um, they have this pin -- pin -- pinball.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  You know, it's -- it's -- it's childish, it's silly, but at least it's -- it's keeping you stimulated until you get to your destination and you're not, you know, there just staring of blank into space.  You're exercising your m- -- you're -- you're -- you're limbs.  [LAUGH] I think that's what this -- 
R:  Now, that's a way of looking [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Now, that's a very good way of looking at it.
L:  Yeah.  You're keeping the blood circulating, right?
R:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.
L:  So, there is [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  So, how long -- how long does a game normally last?
L:  What, fifteen, twenty minutes.
R:  I see.
L:  It all depends.  On some of them the s- -- you run them until you win.  So, you could -- you -- you, ah -- th- there's no definite time limit on them per say. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  You continue playing until.  So, but that's -- I -- I have those games on my laptop but I do that occasionally.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And [several inaudible words] in it, I've -- you know, I have friends who play Scrabble.  [MN] Like, they're at a training session and they're waiting on this training -- the trainer to get their act together and start, they might just, you know, either surf the net or sign some Scrabble game or something and -- and occupy the time.
R:  I see.
L:  So -- 
R:  Oh, okay.  'Cause normally I think of things like the Pacman.  And -- 
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  -- I know that was so habit forming for a lot of young people.
L:  Yeah, and that -- you didn't learn anything from that.  You're just -- you're chasing dots.  How stupid is that?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  The person that created that game should have been, you know [LAUGH] -- 
R:  And then I also have a lot of concern about these, ah, games that the young people play that are very violent.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  You know, over the -- very, very violent.  So [SIGH] it's a dull thing, but you're absolutely right about that, it's --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- enjoyment and it certainly helps you to stimulate your brain having wholesome activity, ah, to do.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE] 
R:  Well, that's -- that's a good one.  [LAUGH] So, what other games are on the computer? 
L:  Well, apart from the -- the -- the card games, there's this Minesweeper game and [several inaudible words] I have a [inaudible] Pilot[?] as well [MN] which --  
R:  Okay.
L:  And on the [inaudible] Pilot there's this sub game where they're -- they're -- you -- the sub is dropping these little bombs and then you have to try and prevent the ship from exploding, that kind of thing.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  But, all of it is just, you know, is another dimension to the machine because although it's there to stimulate and to work, it also has other functions.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It is [several inaudible words] play music.  I don't -- you don't own music?  You don't, right?
R:  Ah, the music on the computer?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yes, I do.
L:  Okay.  Well, just like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's -- it's not there for the educational content, it's just there for stimulation, just to take your mind of something that you might be doing just as a diversion of some sort.  So -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and that is -- [several inaudible words] funny because sometimes you're on a train and you see all these high powered professional people playing games.
R:  Mhm.
L:  On their [several inaudible words] and -- and stuff, and sometimes people -- and their laptops, they look -- they're so intensive as if they're working, and they're not.  [LAUGH] They're trying to figure -- fig- figure the puzzle.  You know -- 
R:  Well, my -- 
L:  So -- 
R:  -- oh, now, I enjoy puzzles.
L:  Okay.
R:  And -- 
L:  Ah, well that's a game for you then.  You could probably do the crossword on -- on -- on the -- on the machine.
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I really -- 
L:  Ah.
R:  -- I enjoy puzzles a lot.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I also like -- well, I wish there was some kind of a picture puzzle because I enjoy doing those as well.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, ah, it's interesting.  It's -- 
L:  It is.
R:  -- very, very interesting.
L:  But, it's all part of the technology.  I foresee in the next couple of years, I think homes and everything will just be totally wired.  If there's electricity all -- you know, if there's an [several inaudible words], the entire world [inaudible].  [LAUGH] 
R:  And you know, it's just moving that way.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, you -- 
R:  It's re- -- 
L:  -- [several inaudible words] and you clap your hands, the lights come on.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You say, "Music" and the music starts playing.  Probably leading to a, you know, a situation where food is replicated.
R:  Well, you know, they used to have that on, ah Star Trek. 
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  They had that on -- 
L:  I heard that they got the idea for cellphones from Star Trek, from the communicator that they -- the crew would wear on their lapels. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  That there -- where they got the idea for the cellphones from.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  Mhm.  Being anywhere and being able to communicate and then people say that television isn't powerful.
R:  It is a very powerful medium.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And a lot of the things that we see, these games and all this -- was, the nineteen sixty four world fair in New York.
L:  Mhm.  [NOISE] 
R:  Which -- have you ever been to a world's fair?
L:  No.  I've never been to a world fair.
R:  If you ever get a chance, they're very interesting and the -- a lot of the things that are very future- --
