R:  Hi.
L:  Oh, hi.
R:  I'm Rhea Schimdt from Minnesota.
L:  Uh-huh. I'm Lynn Pepperell from Wisconsin.  I'm your neighbor [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, close too [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Oh.
L:  This is the first time I've ever done this so this is really --
R:  Me too.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, so it's interesting.  But the topic is about computer games and I don't even have a computer but my grandson is on them all the time.
L:  Okay, I'm -- I have a computer but I don't play -- I do some contests and stuff but I don't play.  My husband does.
R:  Oh.
L:  Plays a lot of games but, um, uh, I -- like I say, I do, uh, play to win things, you know -- you know you enter, you know, certain code numbers --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and stuff but I don't really do a lot of, um, other things but we have ten minutes to talk [LAUGH].
R:  I know.
L:  Are you into refunding?
R:  It's what?
L:  Are you into refunding?
R:  No.  My daughter is all the time and she just gets tons back by doing it from -- and doing it with the games.  She -- she gets all the games free that she enters into.
L:  Well, that's what I was wondering.  If, um, okay see my husband does a lot of the games and stuff but I mean he plays like solitaire.  I do -- I used to play solitaire a lot and that was a lot of fun but it just seems like I don't have a lot of time to do it.
R:  Oh, my kids wants me to get a computer because my husband just passed away so he had one but then I never used it but --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- they said I should start doing it just for the games -- just for --
L:  Oh, you should.  Especially, you know, it seems like there's not much on TV lately and --
R:  It chews up the time.
L:  -- it's just like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's just so much.  It is, like I say, did enjoy playing solitaire and I know my husband has a, uh, whatever you put that in there, the, uh, disk or whatever to play solitaire and he plays it all the time.
R:  Oh.  My son joined this club where they play the computer games on it and I can't think if it's chess or something that they play on it all the time and you can win money on it.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, 'cause they're -- they're really into it so they're into the club and they do it almost every night where they --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- where they play the game and it's a lot of money, you know.
L:  Gee, no.  I-- I -- I've seen different things on the computer about these different things but I've never taken the time to get it into.  I -- I been just mostly working on refunding and stuff but I know, um, there are a lot of neat games with really -- like live action games --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- which they think are very interesting.
R:  Right, and if you -- I mean, it's -- it's great if you can get into that because it does no matter what time of the day you're --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- having a bad day, you can just go flip on the computer and you can be on the computer with it which it really makes it nice.
L:  Exactly.  Especially, I don't know, the way that I get, I don't sleep real good at night.  It'd be nice to have something like that to keep you, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- keep your mind going.
R:  Some of that's pretty scary though because what -- you know, if they get your access codes and stuff, everybody knows exactly what you're doing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, it's -- it's unreal they say how much everything is known or who's on the computer and what you're doing and stuff so that's kind of strange that they can do that much of that.
L:  Yeah, I see I can't imagine how people can do that.  I know they do and I just, you know, hope that it never comes to that.
R:  Yeah, but it -- it does.  I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there's -- there's been a lot of it and stuff but I don't -- you know, they know -- they know what you're doing.  Like if -- say if you're a game person and stuff --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they know that you're doing that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They know exactly what you're doing.  You know, even -- I'm sure the government does.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean they could --
L:  As long as they don't have your, uh, social security number.  I think the games would probably be pretty safe, I would think.
R:  But they've got your name and your access code so they know --
L:  That's right too, yeah.
R:  -- who you are.
L:  But I think if you put just the regular games that you buy, you know, that you 'em in -- the disk that you put in.
R:  Oh, just those, uh --
L:  I don't think they'd be anything on there.  I think those are pretty safe.
R:  Oh, and that -- that could be the ones that you buy --
L:  I -- I think if you would log into a site to play a game then I think you might be in trouble. 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But, um, I think if you put -- you know, if you buy these disks that you can order off the Amazon or something, those I would -- 'cause you really don't have to put in I don't think any keywords in there.  You know, your user code or anything.
R:  So, they would probably just know you're using it but they don't know what you're doing.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  I don't know.  I guess I'm not that up on it but, um, no I think computers are great and the games that you can play on there are -- you know, is quite nice and especially for little kids too, you know.  Give them, you know, learning experiences and --
R:  But some of those games -- now, I've done daycare for the family and I don't even know if the parents realize what they were buying their kids.  They were some really serious things that, uh, I wouldn't want my kids to have.
L:  Oh.
R:  They were bad news and it's like, you know, the stuff that's out there if you just say give your kids money and they go out and buy something, you can buy any type of game or anything.
L:  Yeah, you really have to wa- keep an eye on what you're getting.  I'm just thinking, like, for kids to play, like, um, these maths games and things like that.  That's what I was thinking of but yeah, some of these other games where they're, you know, kinda bloody and gory.  Those I think, um, those you really have to keep an eye on that that isn't brought into your house.
R:  And yet the kids would probably want to go out and buy that because --
L:  Oh, definitely.
R:  -- instead of us telling them, you know, you buy our type of game, they're not gonna want to play solitaire or something like --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's for sure.
R:  -- you know.  Yeah, they wouldn't want to do something like that.  They would want to go to the more serious type of a -- I mean, the bad type of stuff which is --
L:  Yeah, which is more enticing to them than -- versus playing, um, doing maths things or, you know, there are different maths games that you can play or reading games for the kids but I'm sure those aren't going to be as exciting as ones that they shouldn't be playing.  
R:  Right, because my daughter bought my grandson some of the reading type of stuff where -- where the game and like maths and all that type of stuff.
L:  Yeah, that's what I was thinking of.
R:  Yeah, but I mean he'll do it for a while but then he'll want to turn around.  He'll wanna play -- to do something so they all must have to say, "You can't.  This is only what you can have" and stuff like that so that --
L:  And isn't it -- isn't it a shame that that they are drawn to that?
R:  Yeah, because, uh, I don't -- well, I don't know they say it's from TV but I'm not seeing that on TV.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Some of the stuff that's on the computer things.  I'm not --
L:  I think probably their friends and stuff talking to kids at school.
R:  And they're the ones that are telling them about the games but I don't -- I think kids are playing games more on the computer versus watching TV now.
L:  Yeah, oh def-- yeah, I think so too.
R:  Yeah, the kids -- instead of watching TV all the time, the kids have switched to the computer and the computer games --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- whereas older people, you know, they're -- they're still playing the solitaire games and the games that are their mind and stuff versus playing the ones that the kids want.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, you know like --
L:  I think too, uh, the older get -- the older you get to some of these games are good to keep your mind going where, you know, if you don't use it a lot, I think --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- some of these games out there are quite good also.
R:  Oh, I haven't seen -- oh, you mean like the solitaires or which one?
L:  Oh, there's, um -- gee, I can't -- right off the top of my head, I can't think of anybody.  I know my husband plays them.  They're things, um, just to keep your mind working.  I -- At least I can't think right now what they are.
R:  Yeah, because if they're --
L:  Go ahead.
R:  If there would be like math type of things and even just your -- you know, like solitaire makes you keep doing your math and stuff like that because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, they say if you keep -- because you sound like you're about my age and if you keep --
L:  Sixty?
R:  Oh, well I'm going to be fifty eight so ...
L:  Oh, okay.  I got two years on you.  
R:  yeah.
L:  I -- I was thinking oh, scrabble.  Now, that's a good game.
R:  Yes, that -- that would be a really good game for playing.
L:  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking, games like that which are fun and if you don't someone to play with them, that's something you can do yourself and keep your mind going and learn --
R:  Oh, yeah.  And just keeping up your words and stuff, yeah.  Because that's like doing a puzzle.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, scrabble would be really --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, so -- and it would keep you thinking and stuff all the time.
L:  Exactly, and as I say, it's -- there's just no limit to what type of game you couldn't play.
R:  Oh, and all you do is pop 'em in then so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah, that's true.  I'm gonna have to decide maybe if I want to go and get a computer or --
L:  Well, it'd be a nice birthday gift or, you know, if your kids would want all -- I don't know, if you've just got one child or, you know, how many you've got, but I mean that's always something -- once you've got the computer, it's always -- you know, it's just you get to a certain age, what do you -- they give you for Christmas or birthdays or something --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and once you would have a computer there's no limit to what kind of games they could get.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I had it because my daughter's into the games and the coupons so much I had -- and the kids never got one so I got each of my grandkids a laptop or did half of it for their Christmas and birthday gift because --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- otherwise they never got the computer anymore because once the older -- once that age starts using it, then the kids can't use it either [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- because -- 'cause they use it a lot and she -- I mean, she's constantly on it with the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- different -- and how they get the re- like I forgot what games.  There were just three of them that she just got free --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- just by entering something --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- and it -- I mean, the -- the expensive ones too.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, they aren't --
R:  So ...
L:  -- they -- they vary in prices that's for sure but --
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  But that's even better yet to get 'em for free.
R:  Yeah.  Well, that's what it -- that's how it was.  Somehow that she had it with the computer that she had gotten them so that she had 'em free and my grandson was just thrilled because he said, "You got that game" and he was so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- happy with that so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it was kinda nice and plus they deliver it to you and she didn't pay the shipping.
L:  Wow.  Yeah --
R:  So ...
L:  -- it can't get any better than that.
R:  Yeah, well there's that one computer thing that she joined, that club, to get in on it.
L:  Oh.  You know, I -- games -- you can -- I mean, you can spend as much as fifty dollars for a game and --
R:  Or even more.  I thought there was even a higher price.  I thought I had --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- paid for one for my grand ...
