R:  [NOISE] Hi there.
L:  Hi.
R:  My name's Marion.
L:  Hi Marion, my name's Todd.  How are you doing?
R:  Hi, Todd.  I'm doing great. [SIGH]
L:  Well, this is an interesting survey, I've never done this before, so [LAUGH] ...
R:  Oh, this is fun!  This is my third call!
L:  Well that's good --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so --
R:  Yeah, it's a lot of fun but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Now, this subject I'm not really good at --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because I don't watch movies.
L:  Oh, you don't watch movies at all?
R:  [SIGH] Rarely.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Very rarely.
L:  [LAUGH] It doesn't -- I- I've -- we -- we seem to be running into a lot of people like that so --
R:  I- is that right?
L:  Yeah -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So ... I -- I don't watch movies very often, I watch television but what happens is it's just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- very rarely am I willing to go out to watch a movie at a movie theatre any more because it's so expensive, so ...
R:  It is expensive. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  Where are you f- -- where are you from?
R:  Washington.
L:  Washington State?
R:  Yes, uh-huh.
L:  Oh, wow!  I'm [MN] -- I'm calling from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
R:  Oh, right!
L:  Yeah -- so ...
R:  [NOISE] I --
L:  I don't know how expensive it is out there --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but it's -- it's almost like eight fifty, nine dollars to go see a-
R:  It's -- that's more than here but not by much.
L:  No, that's -- that's cra- --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That's still very expensive, so ...
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, but, you know, here you can rent [NOISE] a movie and it's still gonna run you seven or eight dollars.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah. [SIGH]
L:  Like if you go to a Blockbuster it's that much?
R:  Yeah! [SIGH]
L:  Mm.
R:  Yeah -- so, you know, I -- I just, you know, if I watch a movie it's on TV.
L:  Yeah, that's --
R:  [LAUGH] Unless somebody [LAUGH] brings one over [LAUGH].
L:  That tends to be the case too.  Like --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- we- we'll -- we'll watch movies, I mean I'm in school but, we- we'll watch movies during the summertime and uh, you know like when -- when Christmas break is on -- you know, going on because I don't have any pressing and usually that's because my -- my -- my family members, they tend to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they like to watch movies --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so they'll -- they'll go out to Blockbuster and they'll get something, and we'll rent it.  I mean, I went to go see the -- the mov- The Matrix, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -the new Matrix movie, that was probably the first movie that I've seen in the movie theater in a while, so ...
R:  Is that right!
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's just -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's because it's -- there was -- it was hyped so much and I -- I was a big fan of the first one -- so --
R:  I don't think I've been to one since The Titanic! [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really, you went to go see that?
R:  [LAUGH] Oh that was exciting!
L:  Well, what --
R:  Oh! [SIGH]
L:  -- what, well what made you want to go see that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- as opposed to any other movie, I mean.
R:  [SIGH] Well, because it was a history [NOISE]--
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- sort of thing, more or less, you know what I mean, yeah, it was made for movies but --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it's still history. [NOISE]
L:  Is -- is that something you're into --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like history, or ...?
R:  Ah, well --
L:  -- I know that's maybe not necessarily the topic but ...
R:  I do and I don't. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  But.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know, that just -- that just really interested me. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And uh, [SIGH] I hear Drum Line is good.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  It's a new one out.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I haven't -- I haven't seen -- I haven't heard anything, I -- which one is that?  Who's that in -- who's that guy, in it?
R:  Oh, gee, you know, I don't know, um, I was talking to somebody on the internet the other night and they were watching it and they said it's just fantastic.
L:  Oh.
R:  [SIGH] So I'm thinking about renting it but --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- I haven't yet [LAUGH]
L:  So [NOISE] -- so -- so you'll rent things as opposed to watch them -- w- well, do you -- do you own a DVD player?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay, so you'll watch them on DVDs -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- as opposed to ...?
R:  Yeah. [SIGH]
L:  Well see, then -- then it's almost worth it because the DVDs that are coming out have got all the special features, and the out takes and the deleted scenes ...
R:  Oh, s- so much better than the V- VHS.
L:  A- absolutely. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, yeah [MN].
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah, for sure. [SIGH]  And, sound too --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is much better.
L:  Absolutely --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- yeah.  I just -- I -- I dunno, I -- for the -- I'm gonna probably go see, obviously there are a couple -- you know, a couple that I'd be interested in seeing but actually I think I'll probably just --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- wait for a lot of these movies -- th summertime I tend to watch more movies because they're kind of mindless -- mindless things to do in the summertime after school and ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, you know, the better movies are on during -- in -- like when the -- I guess the better movies are put out during the wintertime, the more dramatic movies, in the summertime are, you know, kind of more action, thriller type of stuff.
R:  Mhm.  Well, you know I found though, you know, you listen to the critics on the news --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- about the movies, [SIGH] and I always find [LAUGH] if they think it's wonderful, its rotten! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  If they think it's really bad, it's good! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I kind of go by that! [LAUGH]
L:  Really, that's -- that's an interesting perspective like, that -- that -- that's -- we -- we've seen -- I don't know if you've heard -- what is it?  The Billy Bob Thornton movie Sling Blade, I don't know if you've heard about that?
R:  Uh-uh, uh-uh.
L:  It's -- it's one of these movies --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- that, um, it got really, really good critic reviews --
R:  -- and it was like, [MN] it's an example of that, it got really good reviews by -- by critics and it was a great film, it was very dramatic and [SIGH] we -- we rented it on --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- DVD and it was the most predictable, boring, lacking action --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- lacking anything I'd ever seen.
R:  See!
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's just like, oh my gosh! [NOISE] It- it's so -- I was -- that -- that type of stuff --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Just, you know, I don't -- I don't get it, I don't get critics at all, so.
R:  Yeah, it was -- The Perfect Storm was one like that too.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  The critics said it was just terrible and I really enjoyed it.
L:  Really!
R:  Maybe it's just me! [LAUGH]
L:  I know -- [LAUGH] I -- my wife like it too -- I was -- I never saw that, I think she saw that and it was one of those movies where I notice that if -- if you're with somebody who has seen something a- around you a lot of times --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- like, I h- -- m- -- like, I have a wife, and if she's seen something --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- and I haven't seen it, [MN] very rarely am I going to get to see it because she's [LAUGH] already seen it, you know.
R:  [SIGH] Oh, really, my daughter rents all the time.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [SIGH] And, uh, she watches -- I mean -- she'll rerent --
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  -- the same movie over and over and I think [NOISE] --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- gosh, you know, once is enough, but ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well, there -- there are certain ones I'll do but then -- then I will go out an purchase --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it on DVD if I really think that it's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [SIGH] it's worth it and, like --
R:  I agree with that.
L:  -- like the Lord of the Rings ones --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, I'm -- I'm willing to go purchase those because I'd like to have that and they're just that good, so.
R:  [NOISE] If they're anything like the books.
L:  Oh, they are, they're --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- very much like the books, very close to the story, there are some things that were missing I'm sure.
R:  Really?  Wow.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Those were great.  I haven't read em in years but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I did read 'em all.
L:  It's -- it's -- that one -- that one in itself is just worth to go see it on the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  On the big screen because the difference in that is that even on DVD you get the sound and you get the --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- you can get them in the widescreen, but just the physical size of the screen --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in the movie theater just makes it, you know, it -- it's very intense.
R:  Oh, right.
L:  -- [NOISE] and it's -- and the -- the sound -- you get the surround sound -- and that's where Dolby comes in to really, you know, like -- or THX -- the surround sounds sound really good there too, so ... [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, we have surround sound --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- here at the house --
L:  Uh, but see-
R:  [MN]
L:  -- there you go --
R:  -- but --
L:  -- there's your -- [LAUGH] [MN]
R:  -- but yeah, the screen, I mean, uh, it -- it still, you know, it cuts the screen down on your TV.
L:  Right -- so.
R:  Even with bigger TV sets -- so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, I could see where that would be more exciting, yeah.
L:  Mhm -- so ...
R:  Wow.
L:  [SIGH] But the problem is that- that it's expensive and then you want to buy popcorn and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- all that kind of stuff.
R:  [LAUGH] I know, and there's nothing like theater popcorn! [LAUGH]
L:  No, there's not!  I'm -- my -- my -- my wife actually, when she was pregnant with our son, she, um --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- she actually one night was craving it so bad that she had me run down to the local movie theatre --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- walk in and say, um -- oh, she wanted it and so like, "All right, I'll go get it!"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So I go down to the local movie theatre --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- they had a guy taking tickets before you could get up to the concession stand.
R:  Right. [MN]
L:  And I go, "Listen, I'm just going up -- right up there to the concession stand to go buy my wi- -- my pregnant wife a -- a basket of popcorn".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And he just kind -- he looked at me kind of, you know, like, quizzically and I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I was like, "No, really" and he -- he was like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- he was like, all right, go ahead, so I go up and I walk out of the theatre [LAUGH] with a full bucket of popcorn, hop in my car and drive back home! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, funny! [LAUGH] [MN]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, you got -- it -- that -- it was- it was a moment, I was like, this is- this is one of those moments where I am just -- like I'm -- I'm willing to do anything, so ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, yeah with the movie thea- --
R:  And it's something she's going to remember that, too!
L:  Yeah, I -- I'll never forget that --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, "Um, I'm just here to buy some popcorn" you know! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, that's wonderful!
L:  [several inaudible words] [LAUGH]
R:  I love it! [LAUGH]
L:  So [LAUGH] ...
R:  You're great! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So, I, um --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  You know -- but you might as well buy the biggest tub while you're there and get the free refill that they have and take it home with you, that's --
R:  That's right!
L:  -- what we do, so, get -- get your money's worth -- so --
R:  That's right. [LAUGH]
L:  But, uh ...
R:  [LAUGH] How funny! [SIGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do, di, do, do, do ...
R:  [LAUGH] So, yeah, on that one [LAUGH] we've exhausted those movies! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, running out of -- run out of [LAUGH] -- running out of things to say!
R:  You know, this is the longest ten minutes isn't it?
L:  [SIGH] No, you know I -- I've never done this before so I don't have any sort of perspective on it but, uh, I do know that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- as far as -- as far as movies are concerned [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's like, you -- you run out, unless you've got somebody that knows a lot about movies and you end up talking about what -- well, we can get -- what -- what type of movie do you like or what type of movie do you prefer?
R:  [MN] Ah, [SIGH] I don't like anything blood and guts.
L:  Okay, all right, that's good.  So ...
R:  Yep, I really don't.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, comedies aren't usually funny to me.  I have a strange sense of humor, I think.
L:  Oh, is it a -- is it a dark sense of humor or is it a -- you know ...?
R:  [MN] Well --
L:  Like, wh- what -- what -- what kind of comedy in a movie do you find funny?
R:  [SIGH] Oh, do you --  here I can't even think of an actor that I think is funny and yet I know one.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, the guy that did Big Albert?
L:  Bill Cosby? [NOISE]
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay.
R:  He's funny [NOISE].
L:  All right, so -- so movies like --
R:  That type of humor.
L:  So movies like Ghost Dad, that type of --
R:  Yeah, yeah, I like --
L: [MN]
R: -- the simple stuff.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  You know I was thinking, I don't really have to get into 'em, but, you know --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- if I walk out it's okay 'cause I haven't missed anything, you know that [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, okay! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, somebody --
R:  Bit of bore! [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  -- some- somebody like Chevy Chase, who does kind of slapstick humor, or ...?
R:  Well, no I don't care for him.
L:  Really?
R:  I really --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- don't.  [SIGH] Um, I kinda, I don't like anything dry humor.
L:  Mm.
R:  Uh, it has -- it has to be funny.
L:  Oh, okay, well I --
R:  Silly funny!
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  I like silly funny.
L:  Okay, so
