L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.  My name's Katie.
L:  Hi.  My name is Karen.
R:  Hi.
L:  Um, would you like to start or shall I?
R:  No, you can.  Go ahead.
L:  Okay -- 
R:  [MN]  
L:  -- I've never done this before.  Is this -- 
R:  I never have either -- 
L:  -- your first time?
R:  -- so [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH] So, we're both novices.
R:  Yes.
L:  Um, do you like -- are there any computer games that you like to play?
R:  I play, um, Collapse.  That's about the only computer game that I play.
L:  Oh, what -- what is that.  I've never heard of it or played it -- 
R:  Um -- 
L:  -- myself.
R:  It's -- um, there's blocks, um, you have to -- you have -- you're in like a time period.  You have -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- to, um, like, delete them all in a time perio- period and they have different levels.
L:  Okay.
R:  And I've gotten up to like maybe level ten and that's about as far as I do.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, let's see.  I'm trying to think.  I used to be really big on Tetris.
R:  Okay, I don't know what that is.
L:  That's, um, you -- series of, um, [MN] there are I think four different varieties of four block -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- formations kind of fall from the top of the screen and you have to build them, um, [MN] as levelly as possible and fill in holes and every time you fill in a complete row it disappears and you try to build more and more levels so it's kind of a spatial relationship kind of game. 
R:  Okay.
L:  So, um, I don't even know what -- how many levels there are or anything but -- and I don't even know if I've gotten up to any but [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- they get faster and faster so, it's a -- 
R:  [SIGH] Oh.
L:  -- that one I used to be really into.  And there's another one called Pipe Dreams that you build, um, [MN] pipes, um, and you have to keep ahead of this flow of ooze or something and -- 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- it twists and turns and stuff.  [MN] That one -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- was kind of fun.
R:  I'll have to -- I'll have to look these games up.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then -- have you ever tried, like, Myst or any of those more -- 
R:  No.
L:  -- role playing type games?
R:  No, I haven't.
L:  No.
R:  Is it called Myst?
L:  [MN] Yeah, Myst.  It's M.Y.S.T. and that -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- that's available.  That was a really popular one a few years ago.  Most of these I did before I had kids.
R:  Okay.  Okay.  How many kids do you have?
L:  I have two.
R:  Okay, I have one.
L:  You have one?
R:  Yeah.  Now, do they play games on the computer?
L:  Well, let's see.  Um, my three year old does.  He's, um, he likes to play Elmo.
R:  Okay, yeah -- 
L:  We have like -- like a Sesame Street one and, um, what else does he -- oh, he's really into Reader Rabbit Preschool.
R:  Okay.
L:  And, ah, [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Yeah, I have a four year old so she plays that.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  So, we're both mothers of preschoolers.
R:  Yes.
L:  Pretty cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you try to limit there's, um, her -- 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- her time on the computer?
R:  Yeah.  How about you?
L:  Yeah.  I find that if I let him he'll just go from one game to the next and -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just, you know, if I'm not paying attention or I'm involved in something it'll -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- snowball a lot more than I'd like to so I really do try to limit and -- 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's why I try to get her distracted in something else.
L:  Yep.  [LAUGH] --  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Good luck, sometimes I tell ya.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, do you play most of your games on the internet the ones that you do or are they CD rom?
R:  Um, oh, internet.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah, on the internet.
L:  I have -- see I've never played any on the internet.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  How do you find them.
R:  We find it was on, um, MSN dot com.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And they had, um, you know, it -- it's -- was a new -- it's, um, well, had news and then it had try this -- try these games.  So, I just clicked on it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I'm like thirty minutes later, I'm like, "Oh, okay, I'm --" 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- still playing this game".  [LAUGH] --" 
L:  [LAUGH] Do you do that frequently or -- 
R:  Not too frequently.  The other night I was playing it and I was like, "Oh, I -- I can't do this" you know -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- I have -- I've other things to do here.
L:  Yeah.  I know -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it just -- I guess I am amazed when I look back and see what I did -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- in times previous -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to kids and now -- 
R:  I know.
L:  -- and now I just, oh, the things I used my time for and --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I felt so free about and -- 
R:  Oh, now it's like well, I -- I could be doing other things that, you know, I can't be on this computer, I have other things to do.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I know, and so many things are so pressing.  So -- 
R:  Yeah.  Ah -- 
L:  Anyway, what were there -- were there any other questions we were supposed to -- 
R:  Um -- 
L:  -- go over?
R:  No, I think it was some -- do you play any games and how frequent?
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm trying to think the last time I sat down -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- to actually play a game.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] I know.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] My husband -- 
R:  How old is your other chil- -- 
L:  -- likes to do that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, he's, ah -- he's a [inaudible].  He likes, ah, driving games so -- 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- he tries to do something with that -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- at least once a day I think.  Um, that's -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- his main form of relaxation.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, ah -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- he [inaudible] um, since -- my husband likes -- ah, of course my son does too, so -- 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- he -- to drive with daddy is one of his favorite occupations as well.
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay.  My husband -- 
L:  So -- 
R:  -- plays that Diablo.  Did you -- 
L:  Um -- 
R:  -- ever hear -- 
L:  -- is that a driving game?
R:  Um, I'm not sure what kind of game of it is but that's what he -- you know, it's like when everybody goes to bed it's like, "Oh, I can just relax and play this game".
L:  Yeah.  They seem to use it to veggie out a little bit and get a little -- 
R:  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  -- um, chance to get away from reality, I guess.
R:  Ah, yeah, I guess that's what it is, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Sometimes that can be a good thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And sometimes it can be too time -- time consuming.  But -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [MN] I've -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- gotten caught in that trap myself.  So -- 
R:  Yes.  Yeah.  Now, how old is your other child?
L:  Um, I have an eighteen month old -- 
R:  Oh, my goodness -- 
L:  -- as well -- 
R:  So, you're busy.
L:  -- and so -- yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] A [several inaudible words], well -- 
L:  I realise I get more and more -- as time goes on I think things are starting to let up, you know -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- it's, um, [MN] been a -- a process but it's, ah, it's getting better.
R:  Okay.
L:  It -- well, now that we're through the new born and the two year old stages all at once it seems to be on the downhill slope.  At least I get a full night's sleep some -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- nights now.  So [LAUGH] -- 
R:  That always helps.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  That does help.  [LAUGH] My, um, eighteen month old is just starting to show some interest in the computer as well.  He's -- 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- um, seems to be very mechanically inclined and is fascinated by any kind of machine or electronics or -- I think he's pretty much got the remote for the TV figured out.
R:  Oh, very good.
L:  So, I figure the computer's not far behind.
R:  [LAUGH] Look out.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's what I think my daughter will know more than I will.
L:  Yeah, they really pick up so quickly.
R:  Mm.
L:  I just am that amazed by even what my three year old can accomplish.  He's -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- opened files that -- 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- we never knew existed or [LAUGH] --  
R:  [LAUGH] I know.  I know, it's just -- 
L:  -- maybe he created them, I don't know.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, ah, [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- something.  My husband's quite frequently in there going, "I have no idea where this came from --" 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- or how you managed to open up these screens" or whatever.  Oh, crazy.  So, [MN] --" 
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, but anyway.  [MN] I'm trying to think of anything else I can tell you about computer games.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  I know, I -- I -- I know.  We play -- my daughter plays -- we -- well, I play with her too on, um, play house disney -- 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- dot com.
L:  And that's -- ah, that's another on line.  What do they have available there?
R:  They have, um, like Dora games.  Ah, there's -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- Stanley, um, I can't think of who else is on there.  And, um, she's just -- you know, I mean, I'll sit there and play with her and, um, you know, we have a good time.
L:  So, it doesn't seem like too boring for you [LAUGH] or anything?
R:  No.
L:  It's -- 
R:  No.
L:  -- ah, it's -- 
R:  'Cause then I just watch her and she'll just, you know, zoom, zoom, zoom, like okay.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Wow.
R:  You know, like maybe I -- I need to go into this -- this program myself and fig- -- you know, figure it out.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But -- 
L:  Yeah, ah, there's some parts that my older one has gotten into of the different games where I haven't really figured out either what -- you know, where exactly that came from or -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know.  I -- I suppose I should do better about checking into those things before I, um, have him on them, just so that I know what's available in them and how they're structured and so that I can help him get around a little better.
R:  Yeah.  That's what I think too, you know, um, I -- you know, I should just, you know, sit down one night and just, you know, bring up Play House Disney and -- 
L:  There you go.
R:  -- play some of those games.  [LAUGH] I know, I know, it's like, "Okay".  [LAUGH] --  
L:  It might be more fun than you think it would be but -- 
R:  I know.
L:  -- [LAUGH] 
R:  I know.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Does she have a preference as to which parts or which, um, characters she works with or -- 
R:  She likes Dora.
L:  She does.
R:  Yeah, she loves Dora.
L:  Now, I've never seen that.  Let's see, is that on Nick Junior?
R:  It's on, um -- 
L:  Or is it on the Disney channel?
R:  I'd say it's on the Disney channel but you know what I -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I think you're -- I get confused between those two.  It's on at ten -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I live in Harrisburg and it's on at ten o'clock in the morning here.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, and it's on at eleven.  Ten and eleven.
L:  Okay.
R:  So -- 
L:  Ah, you said h- -- what is it?
R:  Harrisburg.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] Okay, so you're -- you're just right in Pennsylvania.  I'm, um, [MN] up in New York state.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  So, I'm from New York.  So -- 
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Um, we're kind of between Bennington[?] and Albany -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- if you know where those two cities are.  So, yeah -- 
R:  Okay.  Why they're [inaudible] -- 
L:  Harrisburg is a great city.
R:  Yes.
L:  I almost went to college there.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Ah, where -- where at Penn State?
