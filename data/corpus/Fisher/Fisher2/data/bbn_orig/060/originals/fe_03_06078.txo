R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, I'm Jan. 
R:  I'm Pam.
L:  And it's nice to meet you.
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And where are you located?
L:  I'm in Boston.
R:  Oh, Boston.
L:  Yeah -- 
R:  Oh, how -- 
L:  And you? 
R:  I'm in Minnesota.
L:  Oh, okay.  Ah, I can tell by your accent.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Oh, God, you know, they always say that, you know, [several inaudible words] movie Fargo[?] -- 
L:  I know.
R:  We're not that bad.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.  So, I suppose, like, apparently, you know, you people have an accent too.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  I know.  I know it.  We hear that a lot.  So -- 
R:  [LAUGH] It must be our little -- little areas.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly -- 
R:  Okay, yeah -- 
L:  So -- 
R:  So, I suppose we're supposed to talk about computer games.
L:  Yeah, computer games.
R:  So, I don't play any on CD rom.  If I play any it's usually just, you know, like on Pogo or I One on the computer.
L:  Right.  I don't really play any at all.  I'm trying to think.  Not really.  Every once and a while I'll play something, ah, but it's not like a really intense game.  It's just like -- I don't know, like a puzzle game or something.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Like on the computer, um, if I'm at work or something and I'm [LAUGH] bored.
R:  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  But -- but it -- normally I don't really, like, buy any and play them on CD rom or anything like that.
R:  No, I haven't either.  I know my husband -- we were looking, he'd like to get a baseball one.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, ah, I'm thinking, "No, then you'd be on the computer too much".  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  I know, they're really time consuming.  So -- 
R:  Yeah, we're not going to start that.
L:  Yeah, exactly, exactly -- 
R:  We watch baseball enough, you know, we --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- don't need another computer.
L:  Exactly.
R:  But, no, I'll play, like -- I play like Bingo, ah, once in a while or Solitaire or --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, something like that but -- 
L:  Yeah, that's kind of what I play overall.  Like, if -- I don't know, just like those little games.  But, I don't really buy it.
R:  No, I -- yeah --
L:  So -- 
R:  -- I don't.  I think we bought -- when we first got the computer, um, I think we bought, like, Who Wants to be a Millionaire for my daughter.
L:  Oh, fine, yeah.
R:  Yeah, and then that -- 
L:  E- -- 
R:  -- I don't know, she doesn't play much either, which I guess I'm lucky.
L:  Yeah, exactly -- 
R:  You know, a lot of kids are addicted to 'em.  Mine just never really got into 'em.
L:  Well, that's good.  My bro- -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  My brother plays a lot of games -- my little brother, I guess. 
R:  Oh -- 
L:  And I know he'll get, like, those -- like a baseball game or, like -- like, kind of like a simulate flying game.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  But, I mean, you know, I never really got into it and he -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- ah, he never -- I mean, he just really likes them but nobody else really plays them except him and my dad.
R:  Yeah.  No, nobody really around here either.  I think -- I don't know, it -- then you could -- you would just -- it's more stuff you've got to download and then you've got to get all the joysticks and you know, it's like there's enough --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- to do on the computer without that.
L:  I know, exactly.  It can -- I think it can get really complicated.  Maybe it's -- that's why I don't -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- p- play now so much 'cause -- 
R:  Oh -- 
L:  -- I think it can get kind of complicated.
R:  [MN] Oh, I know, I tried one, one time and it had the -- where you had to do the up down arrows and then the, like, the A.B. --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- keys.  Then I'm like, "Okay, forget it" you know?
L:  [LAUGH] I'm not that coordinated.
R:  No, so it's -- I can't play with the mouse [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- forget it, you know?
L:  Exactly.
R:  I'll do hang man or something like that, you know, but that -- it -- that's pretty much the extent of it.  I'll go to -- have you ever been on that, um, like I. one dot com or --
L:  I have -- 
R:  -- Pogo?
L:  I've heard of the sites but I haven't really been on them.  What are they?  what are they?
R:  Well, the Pogo -- I -- I think Pogo is, ah, the number one -- you know, it's free.  Everything's free on there --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- but you can -- you accumulate points and then you can catch -- cash 'em in for, um, like little raffle tickets and then, like -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- every day they give away, like, fifty dollars or -- 
L:  Oh, fun.
R:  -- um, h- h- -- I think once a month it's a thousand dollars and -- 
L:  Oh, wow.  Have you ever won?
R:  I have never won.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I have heard, you know, people when they do chat.  Um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and then you can look under, like, they've got, like, little profiles to see if they really won, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- and people have won so -- 
L:  Oh, exciting.
R:  -- you know, yeah, so I mean, you know, if anything that might be, you know, some incentive, but -- 
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  -- but, I think you got to play an awful lot to --  
L:  So, how do they make their money then, it's just like advertisements?
R:  It's a lot -- yeah --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- advertisement and then in -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in between game they run like a little commercial and then they start the --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- next game.  [MN] 
L:  Okay.  All right.  Well, that's kind of cool though.
R:  Yeah, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so I mean, you're playing and you can win, I guess --
L:  Mhm.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- but [LAUGH] you know, it's a little incentive, but -- 
L:  Yeah, sure.  Sure.
R:  -- but I'd rather -- you know, I just play for, you know, something to do, like you said, when you're bored or --
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.
R:  -- a little quiet time, a little down time.
L:  Yeah.  But, I'm not really a very avid -- 
R:  No.  No.
L:  -- ah, computer game player.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] No.  No.  Me either.
L:  [LAUGH] So -- 
R:  Ah, so, I'd rather do so many -- like, shop or something.
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's definitely what I'd prefer [LAUGH] to do -- do -- 
R:  [LAUGH] There is so much to look at -- 
L:  I know.  I know -- 
R:  -- you know, it's [NOISE] -- 
L:  -- especially here.
R:  Oh, I bet.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, I bet.  I -- 
L:  [LAUGH] You can get into a lot of trouble.
R:  Oh, I just love that area where you're from.  I haven't been there for years.
L:  Oh, you should come visit.
R:  Well, my husband and me want to do that whole area and do like a [several inaudible words] thing --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, from way up north, you know, New York or all the way down or something --
L:  Mhm.  That'd be nice.
R:  -- that way.  Yeah, so we're sort of planning that but --
L:  Oh, that'd be fun.
R:  -- we got about a fourteen year old and we got to wait, ah, one more year and then we'll go on our own vacation.  [LAUGH] We're --
L:  Yeah, that'll be -- 
R:  -- still doing the water parks.
L:  -- that'll be good.
R:  Yeah, and I'd just love to come over there and visit again.  It's so beautiful.  [MN] 
L:  Yeah, it's nice.  I know -- this is my first year in New England.  I'm from -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- North Carolina actually. 
R:  Oh.
L:  And you know, it's -- it's really cold.  Like, the weather -- the weather really --  
R:  Well, we're used to that.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- throws me.  I can't -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- it's so cold.
R:  Oh -- 
L:  If it gets May and it was like fifty --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- degrees yesterday.
R:  Oh, we had a good day today.  It got up to, I think, seventy four --
L:  Yeah, we had --  
R:  -- today.
L:  -- a good day today too.  But, yesterday it was freezing and then it rains a lot here too.
R:  Mm.
L:  That's the other thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, it's -- it's pretty much the weather that I don't like about -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- the area.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah -- 
L:  But -- 
R:  -- you got to -- you know, anything's better than Minnesota.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Yeah.  Well, that's true.  So, it's pretty -- well, does it stay chilly though, like through about this time and now it starts -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to warm up?
R:  Yeah, now we'll have a -- we'll have a stormy month and then it'll get hot and -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then that ends about September first and then win- -- then winter starts.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  It's just so much -- it's so much winter.  That's what I don't like.
R:  It is so long.  Although --
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  -- this year we didn't have any snow.  I cannot complain so we real- -- 
L:  This year?
R:  Yeah, we had -- if we had five inches of snow all winter I -- you know, it was -- be a miracle.
L:  Oh, wow.  That's kind of nice.
R:  It, yeah -- it was just odd, so --
L:  We had tons.
R:  -- I think -- yeah, I think you got all our weather.
L:  [MN] It was horrible.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It was horrible.  My first year here there was like a big blizzard and it was terrible.
R:  Oh.
L:  But, I don't know, you get used to it I guess.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  No, we're -- we're thankful.  [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Now, let's see what kind of spring we have and it'll probably make up for it and be stormy or something.
L:  I know.  [several inaudible words] we have a nice spring but, who knows.
R:  Who knows.  [several inaudible words] you can't win.
L:  Mm, I know.
R:  So, where did you hear about these phone calls?  [MN] Did you on line or a friend or -- 
L:  Yeah, just a friend.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, it's interesting.
R:  It is.
L:  Yeah, I -- 
R:  Is this your first one or have you done more?
L:  This is my first one and I've actually done -- I did some research through the University of Pennsylvania on a -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- on a study they did.  So, it was kind of -- I guess that was kind of done through, like, another school in North Carolina.  So, I worked on that for a while.  So, it's kind of cool, actually, to be on the other side of the -- 
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  -- of the study.  So, this is a study about, like, family relationships that I worked on -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- at, um, UNC Greens[?] borough and, um, but just, yeah, this is interesting.
R:  Yeah, it is different and -- 
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- and this is only my third one and it -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it's, you know, [several inaudible words].  The different topics and where you -- you know, everybody's from and how they even work at it, it's kind of interesting.
L:  Yeah, it is kind of cool to -- are they just, like -- [several inaudible words] or are they just looking at, like, through stranger relationships or something -- 
R:  I guess, how -- 
L:  They must be.
R:  -- maybe how people, you know, can talk if, you know -- if you give 'em a subject maybe --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that, you know, it's easier for people to converse or, you know, or if maybe people that you could just put 'em on line to each other, you know, how they struggle or -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, I suppose there's many different things that they could look at, or how long they even stay on topic.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Ah, right [LAUGH] um, which --  
R:  It's -- 
L:  -- with us was like, what, three minutes?
R:  Yeah [LAUGH], I mean --
L:  We don't play computer games.
R:  -- that's the way it always is.
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Yeah.  I --
L:  Oh, that's funny.
R:  -- suppose if we did actually play, you know, then we could compare games or something -- 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I could, huh.
R:  -- but, if neither one of us don't play it, there's really not too much to talk about, you know? 
L:  Ah, right.  Exactly -- 
R:  You know, we're -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- we're both not too interested in [several inaudible words].
L:  No.  No.
R:  No.
L:  You're right.  They probably do like a how long we stayed on topic.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Sorry guys.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Ah, yeah.  Too bad.  [LAUGH] Well, they'll just have to hook up to people that, you know, do the Sims or something like that -- 
L:  Yeah, exact- -- oh, that's a fun game.  I've played that before.
R:  Oh, I haven't done that one either.  I've heard it's really good.
L:  Yeah.  I played it briefly at my sister's house.  It was kind of fun.
R:  Yeah, I know, I have -- my daughter's friends, they got, like, the whole -- the number one, number two, where they go on vacation and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, their whole little lives.  But, I haven't checked that one out yet.
L:  Mm.  Well -- 
R:  I don't want to -- it's like I said, I don't want to get too addicted.  [LAUGH] --
L:  No.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm on the computer enough.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Oh, these [inaudible].
L:  Exactly.
R:  They'll be carrying me out of here.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] And I don't need to do it at work.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Me neither.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Me neither.
R:  Especially some days when I'm all there by myself, it's --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  like, "Oh, God".
L:  Exactly.  Oh, gosh, I know.
R:  It's like, oh, the other day I sat at work and, like, "Oh, my God, there's nobody here to talk to".
L:  I know.  What's -- what's on the computer?
R:  I opened up the door just to see people go by.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] I know.  I know.  It can be isolating, [inaudible] you just 
R:  Oh, it is, it's -- yeah, I don't care for it.  I just like it when the people are there.  [MN] 
L:  Mm, me too.  Me too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't like to sit by myself.  It makes the day go by too slow.
R:  Oh, it does.
L:  It's depressing.
R:  It is very depressing.
L:  I know.  What kind of work do you do?
R:  Well, I do [inaudible] --
