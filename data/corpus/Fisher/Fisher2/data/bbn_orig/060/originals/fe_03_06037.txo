L:  Hi. 
R:  Hi.
L:  My name is Robyn. 
R:  My name is Serita[?].
L:  Um, I'm in Florida. [LAUGH] 
R:  You're in Florida?  I am on the East Coast.  I'm in Delver[?], Delaware.  Mhm.
L:  Oh, cool.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I'm from Pennsylvania. 
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I, um, I w- -- I was born here and I've lived in the Midwest, in Michigan and Indianapolis, but I'm back here now.  
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  So, would you rather go to the movies or would you rather rent?
R:  Well, you know, w- with me, it depends on the weather. [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay.
R:  If it's nasty and cold a- -- or snowy outside, I'd rather rent a movie.
L:  Right.
R:  But if it's nice, you know, I'll -- I'll go out to the theatre.
L:  Right, it's -- it's more enjoyable at the theatre, but I have a toddler, so I can't. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, okay. 
L:  [LAUGH] For me, I'm stuck inside -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I'm renting. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  How old is your toddler?
L:  She is twenty months, so --
R:  Twenty months --
L:  -- almost two. 
R:  -- okay, okay.
L:  Do you have children?
R:  No, I don't have any kids.  Nope --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- but I know how that is.  I have niece and nephews, so ...
L:  Yeah.  We're -- we're --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- held captive in the house. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And, you know, you don't really wanna leave home, I don't know. 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  So ...  But I would much rather go to the movies.  I haven't had that good butter popcorn in a long time. 
R:  [LAUGH] [inaudible] --
L:  That's the best part.
R:  Yeah, it i- -- yeah, I was just going to say, that's one of the really good things about the movies.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's hard to get that without actually going to a movie --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that popcorn. 
L:  Mhm, and the gummy bears. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH] 
L:  I can't even remember what my last movie was. 
R:  Really?  Oh, it's been that long, huh?
L:  Oh, my -- [MN] it's been over a year. 
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  It's probably been two years. 
R:  Okay.  Okay.
L:  [MN] We spend all of our money on the baby, so we really don't do anything for ourselves.  We just watch TV. 
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh. 
L:  So, what was your last movie?
R:  My last movie, I -- I haven't been recently.  My last one was, um, Antoine Fisher, the one with, um, Denzel Washington, with the psychologist. 
L:  Okay, I didn't see the previews.  
R:  That wa- --
L:  I don't get out much.  I don't even --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- watch the news --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- 'cause I'm always -- I always have the cartoons on for her --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- oh.
R:  I can believe it.  It -- it's a totally different lifestyle with a child.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I can believe it. 
L:  My dad comes to visit and he's just like, "Okay, what's going on with the world?" when he --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- goes home. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Ah.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, well.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  That's funny. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I forget what the other question was that they asked.
R:  [NOISE] Um, let's see, what did they say?  They said, ah, the last time you went to the movie -- or --
L:  And did you like it?
R:  Oh, yeah.  Did you like it?  Yeah, I did.  I enjoyed that a lot.  That was a very good movie.  Yeah, and it was based on a true story, too.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think that makes a difference because it's more believable.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah. 
L:  You know.  Or if it's, like, based on a book that you've already read or something. 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, it makes it more re- real. 
R:  I -- I like those type of movies, when it's based on something true.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I like those kind of movies.
L:  Right.  Me too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I also like comedy.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I do, too. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] I saw, um, oh, gosh, what is it?  Sweet Home Alabama.  That was a good comedy.  That was a while ago, though.  That was n- -- probably over six months ago.  That was the --
L:  Gosh, I need to get out. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Well, it is on video now, so that's --
L:  See, that --
R:  -- that's a good one to rent.
L:  -- there's a chance for me.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's a good one for you and your husband to rent.  That's cute and funny.
L:  Okay, it's called Sweet Home Alabama?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  All right. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, we really do need to get out more.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] You don't really think about it, you know --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- 'cause all our friends have kids so we just, you know, talk about whatever, you know, the kids, and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and you don't really think about, you know, we don't really have --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a life any more --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- besides her. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  But do you know what?  That's a good thing.  That shows that you are, you know, right into raising your child.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So, that's a good thing.
L:  Our whole house is, like, centered around her and --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- oh, but that's okay 'cause peop- -- some people say, "Oh, you'll lose yourself".  I don't lose myself, I mean, I do things that I wanna do.  I do my scrap book and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, I watch my shows. [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  So, it just makes you happy. 
R:  That's true.
L:  Whatever --
R:  That is true.
L:  -- makes you happy. 
R:  Yeah.  Very true.  Yeah.
L:  But when I rent a movie, I, um, pop popcorn anyway, 'cause I have to pretend. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You have to get the atmosphere going, huh?
L:  [several inaudible words] comes a little close, but not --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- doesn't really hit it on the head. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH] Oh, my goodness. 
L:  That's funny.  And you --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- can also pause and, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- do what you gotta do.  If you have to go to the bathroom, you don't miss anything, that's a --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- that's a pro.
R:  That is.  That is definitely a pro.
L:  And then you don't lose your seat.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I can never find my damn seat.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's so dark, I'm like, "Argh". 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH] Oh, gosh.  It is -- it is definite advantages to doing it at home, most --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- definitely. 
L:  We get to eat dinner and watch the movie, that's kinda nice --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to just relax and sit in bed.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, we do everything in the bedroom, 'cause, you know, we don't want to make noise for the baby --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- well, the toddler, whatever.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We don't wanna make any noise out there, so we just go to our bedroom and watch TV and movies and stuff. 
R:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH] 
L:  Hm. [LIPSMACK]
R:  Did -- you said you were in Florida?
L:  Yes.
R:  What part of Florida are you in?
L:  Um, right above Orlando.  We're in Apopka[?].
R:  Oh, okay, okay.
L:  Yep, right just north of Orlando. 
R:  Okay, I -- I was in Orlando, ah, last year, this time -- around this time last year, yeah.
L:  Hot?
R:  And I have -- I have some friends in, ah, Corel Springs, too. 
L:  Okay, cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Florida's pretty.
R:  It is.  It -- and the weather was beautiful when I we- -- I happened to pick a week where it was perfect.  No rain --
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  -- it was --
L:  It's raining now.
R:  Is it? [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  It's kinda rainy here.  It's on and off. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Hm.  Have you done these before?  These calls?
R:  I've done one other one before.
L:  Yeah, I've done two.
R:  Oh, have you?  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, one of them, oh, gosh, I don't even remember what the question was, it was so -- oh, um, would you +perjure yourself?
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  [MN] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, that was one, we were like, "Argh". 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And then the other one was so vague.  Oh, they said, "What -- what would draw -- what would be the cutoff point, what would -- how would you draw the line between humor and, like, what would be overboard?"  And we were like, "Well, what would be the setting?"
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  You know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like, if you're at a party, that's way different than if you're at work. 
R:  That's true.  That's very true. 
L:  So, we didn't even -- we had no idea, we just kept making up scenarios.  We're like, "Okay, if you're at work, what would be appropriate?"
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  "If you're at a party --"
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  "-- what would be appropriate?"
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  "If you're drunk?" [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Everything was different after --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- so many different levels of appropriateness. [LAUGH] 
R:  That's true.  That is true.
L:  That one was my hardest.  What was your --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- last subject?
R:  Mine was, um, [LIPSMACK] if you could do it all over again, what would you do?
L:  Oh, wow --
R:  And see --
L:  -- that's neat.
R:  -- I -- and I -- and I don't get into regrets, though.  I mean, you know, you wouldn't be the person that you are --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- if certain things hadn't happened.  You know what I'm saying?
L:  Right. 
R:  So, I -- I kinda felt that was -- it was kinda difficult to me, but, ah, one thing that I did say was school.  I would, you know, I would have continued my education continuously instead of stopping --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and then going back, 'cause it's hard to go back to school.
L:  Yeah, I can imagine. 
R:  Yeah.  I --
L:  See, I don't know what I would do differently either.
R:  -- it is -- you know, it makes you who you --
L:  I might --
R:  -- are.
L:  -- eat less. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Well, you know what, I think most of the -- the majority of Americans have that problem. 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  I -- yeah, I mean --
R:  But, yeah --
L:  -- with everything else, I'm, you know. 
R:  Yeah, it ma- -- you know, you're the sum total of all the things that you've gone through. [NOISE]
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You wouldn't be as strong as you are if you --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- didn't have the problems.
R:  Exactly.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, and the things that you did, it's not like you did it for you --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, things just happen.
R:  Exactly.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  Hm.  What else about movies?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't know. 
R:  [LAUGH] I, um, you know, like I said, I haven't been recently.  I -- I know they need to keep the fees low.  They keep raising these fees, I won't be going to the movie at all.
L:  Yeah --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I'm with that.  I mean, you could buy a movie on eBay for less than you can go to --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- a mov- -- the movie theatre. 
R:  Exactly.  That is -- that's crazy. [NOISE]
L:  I don't know where the money's going.  I mean, I know they spend millions of dollars on the movies --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but they're making millions of dollars.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I mean, they're like Disney.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I mean, the money it costs for the popcorn, for the drink, for the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- movie, damn, might as well go out to the cheesecake factory.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh --
R:  Oh, God, I love that place.
L:  Me too.
R:  Why did you [LAUGH] bring that up? [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I wish it was a question about what's your favorite restaurant, I'd be like --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  "Oh, [inaudible]".
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, I love that place.
L:  Mm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah. [SIGH]
R:  But, yeah, the movies are getting expensive, I -- to be honest I think a- a lot of [NOISE] teenagers are going to the movie now, whereas opposed to, you know, people who are older.
L:  Okay, yeah, that's true.
R:  That's my impression. 
L:  Yeah, 'cause we're more tired [LAUGH] --
R:  I think so.
L:  -- and they just wanna get out of the house and run around.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Mm.
R:  They -- they wanna see it when it first comes out --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- and see, I don't necessarily have to see it when it very first comes out.
L:  And they're the ones with all the money. [LAUGH] 
R:  True too.
L:  They got the allowance. [LAUGH]
R:  Yep, you're right.
L:  We have to put it into the house.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh.
R:  I do -- I really think that that's the, ah, the people that they are dir- -- you know, direct it towards.
L:  Yeah, that's true, 'cause the target audience you can tell --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with all the craziness that's in the movies [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- from miles away, argh.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I don't wanna see that one.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, I wanna see that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Daddies Daycare.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  That looks so cute.
R:  It does.
L:  And I'm like, "Oh, my God, that's funny".
R:  [LAUGH] It -- d- -- my aunt, ah, she -- she runs a daycare and I told her, I said, "You should definitely go see that movie" [LAUGH] 'cause I bet that is -- 
L:  She'll have --
R:  -- hilarious.
L:  -- nightmares. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  I bet she can relate to some of it, too, though. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, oh, I used to work in daycare, oh, dear --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- God[?].
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Now I'm living it. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  It's different with your own child, though.  You -- you're more patient.
R:  I can believe it, I can believe it. 
L:  One is a lot better than, like, twelve. 
R:  Yes --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- yes. 
L:  I guess that's true with any kind of job --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- o- --
