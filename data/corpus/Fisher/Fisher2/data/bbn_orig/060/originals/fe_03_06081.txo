L:  Catherine.
R:  Hi, I'm Pat.
L:  Hi Pat.  How are you?
R:  Oh, I'm fine.  Do you play computer games?
L:  N- no.  [LAUGH] Not -- 
R:  N- -- 
L:  -- at all.  I don't think -- 
R:  No.
L:  -- I've ever played.  I think I played a computer game once when I was, like, eight.  [LAUGH] But, no I don't.
R:  I -- well, I play all the time.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  [LAUGH] I -- I play on the internet.  I play CD games.
L:  Huh.
R:  I play, ah, the regular games that came with Windows.
L:  Hm.
R:  Ah, my favorite CD game -- well, I like -- I like the Salmon.  You've heard of the Salmon?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Well, I -- I do like the Salmon.  Ah, I don't play on line.  I just -- just play on the CD but I do -- I do like the Salmon.  But, I also like this game, it's called Heroes of Light and Magic and they're on version four now and it's -- it's a little bit violent.  But, um, sometimes that's good, you know, when you're mad it gets your aggressions out.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Yeah, I guess so.  I never thought about it that way.  I guess I'm too busy to play games on the computer.  I use -- I use -- I mean, I do, ah, email and I use the internet but I -- I never -- it never occurs to me to play games on my computer.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I've been a computer person for the last, ah, thirty five years and so I find time to -- 
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  To [LAUGH] play.
L:  Yeah.
R:  There's always time to do something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I -- I program and I -- 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, I've written some computer games.
L:  That's -- we have a friend who, um, is a graphic design artist and he designs, like, computer games.  He like designs -- not like the programmes, but he does the like, um, design part -- graphic design part.
R:  Right.  Well, I do the programing part of it.  I haven't -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'm not -- I'm not very good at art.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, um -- 
L:  I'm not good at it either, so [LAUGH] where -- 
R:  Do you use a computer -- 
L:  -- where are you calling from?
R:  -- at work?
L:  What's that?
R:  Do you use a computer -- 
L:  Oh, yeah, all the time.  I just don't program.  You know, it's not -- yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, you don't ever, like, play the Solitaire or -- 
L:  No.
R:  Minesweeper -- 
L:  I'm far too busy.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Well, you need to tell them they give you -- got to give you a few minutes there once in a while.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I'm calling from the south.  From Mississippi.
L:  Everyone I've talked to on this has been from the south.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, actually I found out about this through the internet.
L:  Well, someone, ah, one of the groups I, um, I'm with here in Phili- -- I put the thing on the [several inaudible words] and she told me to -- [LAUGH] told everyone to, ah, do it because then if she signed people up she would get ten dollars a person.  So -- 
R:  Well, we only -- 
L:  -- you know?
R:  -- get a dollar a person now.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yes.
L:  Hm.
R:  But, now they're looking for men.  They want fifteen thousand men.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, if you recommend a man and he joins up then you get a dollar for referring him.
L:  Wow.
R:  But, um, you really ought to try a game.  It -- it does a lot of, um, lot for your dexter- dexterity and, um, [MN] ah, well, I -- I found, you know?  [LAUGH] It -- it does take your mind off of everything for a couple of minutes so that when you get back to it it's -- it's fresh.
L:  Yeah.  Well, that -- that's a good, ah -- that's a good point.
R:  Well, I -- I -- m- -- and -- where I worked last, I was in charge of training.  Um, I put in, ah, the net- -- the -- the complete network and I was in charge of training everybody to use it and that's what I used to train everybody, was the computer games.
L:  Mm.
R:  And my boss didn't particularly care for 'em playing games, but it did teach everybody how to use the mouse and how to get around the computer.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I thought that was, um -- and then the email.  That was the two things that everybody was most interested in and learned the most on.  Using the computer games and using -- using the email.
L:  Hm.
R:  But, I -- I'm not very much at playing games on the internet I -- I do play a few games on the internet but mostly I don't play against other people --
L:  I didn't even know you could play games on the internet.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Everywhere.
L:  Huh -- 
R:  Just everywhere.
L:  Interesting.
R:  There's, ah, there's -- MSN's got there own called zone dot com and you can play word games and board games and you can play with other people or against, ah, or with yourself and just against the computer.
L:  Hm.
R:  Um, there's pogo dot com where you can actually win money for playing games.  Um, then there's places where you have to have the CD in order to [MN] play with people that have a CD on their -- 
L:  On line.
R:  -- end as well.
L:  Yeah.  Hm.  [MN] That's -- that's cool.  The world of the internet I -- 
R:  My -- my grand daughter -- we home school my grand daughter -- 
L:  Oh, cool, cool.
R:  -- I home school my grand daughter.
L:  Mm.
R:  And she, um, she -- we -- a lot of her lessons we do with, ah, with games because there's Fun School and Fun Brain -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they have a lot of, um, math an reading and spelling -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- games.  So, again she's le- -- she's playing, but she's actually learning as well.
L:  Hm.
R:  Plus I buy her things like Carmen Santiago.  Where in the world's -- 
L:  Oh, yeah, I used to -- 
R:  -- Carmen Santiago.
L:  -- watch that show.
R:  On the CD.
L:  That's a game?  That's a computer game?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah -- 
R:  And -- 
L:  -- I grew up watching that show.  That's -- 
R:  And she -- she plays -- 
L:  -- an awesome show.
R:  -- it on the computer all the time.  And, um, I have a -- I have several, ah, Jump Start Adventure.  She's getting a little bit too old for the Jump Start Adventure now though.
L:  How old is she?
R:  She's ten.
L:  Oh.
R:  But, they -- they're mo- mostly for first, second, third grade.  They -- they don't have a lot for forth, fifth and sixth.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, but there's so much on the internet.  There's a place where we go, it's called Power Proof Reading and they make a game out of -- out of proof reading the, um, learning English and -- and language all right?
L:  Huh.
R:  It's great.
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  Do you have children?
L:  Oh, God no.  I'm twenty one.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.
L:  No, I'm still in school.
R:  Well, I'm a grand mother.
L:  Yeah.  No, I caught that part.
R:  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] You know --
R:  I only have one but [LAUGH] -- 
L:  -- it's awesome that they home school.  Um, they had one?
R:  I only have one grand child.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, so you do plan to have children?
L:  Mm, yeah, not for a long time.  I work with kids.  Like, I love working with kids.  So, I teach kids bike repair.  So -- 
R:  Wow.  My grand daughter could really use that.
L:  They have programs, like the one I work in all over the country.  I don't know of any in the -- there's -- I know there's one New Orleans.  But, I can't -- 
R:  I'm not far from New Orleans.
L:  Yeah.  I haven't -- I don't know much about the other states.  But there's -- 
R:  And I could just type in bike repair and I'll get -- get something back on -- 
L:  Um, no -- 
R:  I mean, in the phone book are you all list- -- 
L:  -- probably not bike repair.  Like, the organisation I work for is called Neighbourhood Bike Works and there's a Bike Works in Seattle that I worked at -- 
R:  Bike Works.
L:  -- and there's a north Portland Bike Works in Portland and there's, like, bike programs in northern Pennsylvania.  There's -- there's some, like, at all over.  Um, similar programs where kids come and get a bike.  It's like they can get to -- 
R:  And even in -- 
L:  -- earn a bike.
R:  -- college you didn't play games on the computer?
L:  Oh, God no.  I was far too busy.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Oh, no -- 
R:  My kids weren't that busy.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  I -- see I play -- just, I play games like soccer and kick ball --  
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and I ride my bike.  [LAUGH] And I go mountain biking.  So, no.  And I play Scrabble.  So, I -- that's a board game though.  See --
R:  Oh, no, that's on the internet.
L:  -- I don't play computer games.
R:  You can play Scrabble on the internet.
L:  On the internet?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Mm.
R:  And you can play with groups.
L:  [NOISE] --
R:  Ah -- 
L:  Wow.
R:  -- that's -- that's a lot of fun.
L:  Hm.  I'll have -- 
R:  To -- to see -- 
L:  -- to try that.
R:  -- the kind of words that people from different areas are picking.
L:  Yeah.  Huh.  That's interesting.  No, I do plan to have kids though.
R:  Well, I -- I just -- there's so many CDs for the younger children.
L:  Mhm.
R:  People -- I -- I wish that I had had that when mine were little because -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you can teach -- you -- you can start 'em off with, like -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- Blues Clues and -- and -- and Dr Seuss and Fisher Price, um, CDs.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And start 'em off reading at -- at two year's old.  Start em off -- 
L:  Wow.
R:  -- using the mouse and -- and the colors and the shapes and learning to read.  There's so much that you can teach the children with the computer games now.
L:  That's cool.  The kids I work with don't know how to read.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Really?
L:  Most of them don't, yeah.  They're from west Phili- -- so most of them are from, like, projects and stuff.  So, some of them know how to read and then -- 
R:  But, I bet they know -- 
L:  -- some of them -- 
R:  -- how to use the computer.  Most -- 
L:  Most of 'em, yeah -- 
R:  -- of them -- even if they -- 
L:  -- most of them do.
R:  -- even if they don't have computers in their homes, they know how to use them.
L:  Yeah, I know.  Most --
R:  Kids are not afraid -- 
L:  -- all of them do.
R:  -- of computers and -- and it's -- and it -- it -- it's -- it's something that we ought to turn our attentions to besides bombs, um, is to educating our children and -- and the computers are the direction to go.
L:  Hm.  Hm.
R:  In my opinion.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I know.  That -- ye- yeah, you can have an opinion.
R:  And they do have to get out and -- and do the soccer and the bikes and -- and get some exercise.  But, they -- they will sit down and play with a computer and they're interested in it and there are games that'll help to teach them while they don't even realise they're being taught.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, they'll think they're just playing a game.
R:  And it's, ah -- 
L:  Yeah, see I didn't know they had Carmen Santiago on a -- on a CD rom.  That's so cool.  I loved that show.  [LAUGH] 
R:  It took me a long time to get the -- actually it's an old CD game.  Um, it was out back in the nineties.
L:  Mm.
R:  And it's hard to get it now but -- 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- I got it on ebay.
L:  Okay.  'Cause I remember wa- -- I mean, I remember watching that when I was like ten.
R:  Do you ebay?
L:  So -- no, no.
R:  You don't --
L:  No.  No.
R:  -- do that either?  [LAUGH] --
L:  No, no.  That --
