R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, I'm Brenda in Ohio.
L:  I am Sheryl in Kansas.
R:  Okay, Sheryl.
L:  [MN]
R:  [LAUGH] I don't really go to the theaters myself.  I like to rent the movies and watch 'em at home.
L:  I do too.  We have small kids and so it's easier just to get some popcorn and spread out on the couch and -- and do it that way for us.  But we do go to see the big -- like the new Disney shows and stuff that come out but, um, we really probably only go to the movies twice a year I think.
R:  That's more than us [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, really.  You guys don't go at all?
R:  My husband goes with our teenage son but, you know, men like different shows and I don't like a lot of graphic, gory, you know.  
L:  Yes.
R:  I like comedies.
L:  I do too.  Those are our favorite.
R:  [MN]
L:  Well, we watch Disney all the time.  
R:  Yeah, now we did that when our son was young but we got a teenager.  He's sixteen now.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, you know, it's like he's grown [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's hard to find good movies too.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I agree.  So, um --
R:  And even --
L:  Um, so do you guys like have a certain -- do you rent movies a lot or ...?
R:  Yeah, we have --
L:  You do?
R:  -- a Blockbuster's gold card [LAUGH].
L:  Okay.
R:  We rent 'em so much [LAUGH].
L:  Okay, a gold card.  So, do you get a good deal with the Block- Blockbuster gold card?
R:  Well, the way it works is, you know, you pay your yearly membership --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but once you get -- you rent so many movies you get a gold card, so every Mon- Monday through Thursday when we rent a movie we get one free.
L:  Oh.  Maybe I should check into that [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We go to Blockbuster and I just take coupons in but I don't, um --
R:  You don't --
L:  I didn't know they even had gold cards.
R:  -- you don't have the membership card?
L:  We have a membership card but I didn't know it was called a gold card.
R:  And you paid ten dollars for it, right?
L:  No.  It was free way back.
R:  Oh, see now, I don't know.  They used -- Blockbuster's used to be you would sign up for this particular program --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and it'd be a regular Blockbuster's card and it's ten dollars but every month in the mail, they send you a coupon.  You get a free rental.
L:  Oh.
R:  But then Monday, Tuesday and Wednesdays when you rent a new release, you get a free one too.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, you might want to ask your Blockbuster.
L:  Yeah, I need to do that.
R:  They might be ripping you off.
L:  I know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  So, you're from where?  Ohio?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Okay.  Okay.
R:  And you're in Kansas?
L:  Kansas, yeah.  I'm by, um, um, Overland Park or Kansas City.
R:  Okay.  I know [LAUGH].
L:  Anyway, I'm trying to think of the last movie we even went to see.
R:  We didn't go to the movies and see -- I just recently watched, uh, Fly, Catch me Fly, with tom Hanks and, um --
L:  Oh, yeah, I like Tom Hanks.
R:  I love Tom Hanks.
L:  He is good.
R:  But it was a little bit slow but I do have in there to watch the new one.  Sandra Bullock one.
L:  Oh, what is it called?  I can't think of --
R:  [MN]
L:  I think I saw a preview of it.
R:  I'll tell you in a minute.  I've got to walk in there and open my DVD player up [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Mummy wanted this movie [NOISE].  Well, no my son took it out of there [MN].  Oh, he put it in his case.  See, when you have a teenager, you don't have nothing of your own.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, great [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, you know, what's --
L:  That's what I get to look forward.
R:  -- Mum's is there's.  Uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yep, that's what you get to look forward to, sorry [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Unless you're walking out [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, um [NOISE].  Yeah, I'll be off in a minute, okay.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's my little boy.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, we buy a lot of videos too and just keep 'em on hand.  Do you guys do that?
R:  Yeah.  I have all the Disney ones.
L:  Oh, you do.  So do we.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So do we.  There -- there's nothing better than Disney though.
R:  No, Disney's the best.  Uh, in the family.  Family.  Now I love the Hallmark channel.
L:  Uh-huh.  We -- we watch that too.
R:  Yeah, they have a lot of good movies on there.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Because everything has such -- I mean, you know, I know like damn and hell but every movie always has a cuss word in it.
L:  I agree.  My husband and I are both saying that.  We have to really watch everything or monitor everything on TV and on --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- the movies and it's hard to find a good movie [LAUGH].
R:  It is.
L:  But you can almost always count on, you know, like Disney.  We're going to go see Finding Nemo this month [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, are you [LAUGH]?
L:  That's the new one.  Have you seen that, with the ...?
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  It's these two fish and, um, I think one's the father and one's the son and then the son gets lost and he ends up in aquarium in a doctor's office --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- or something like that and he's trying to find him.
R:  Oh, that's sounds --
L:  So it sounds like a cute --
R:  -- cute.
L:  -- show for the kids.
R:  Yeah, well I like them kind of movies.  My son --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, he's a teenager but he still buys the Disney movies.
L:  He -- well, good.
R:  yeah.
L:  I hope my kids still like them when they get older.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh well.
L:  So, um --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, Tuck Everlasting I just watched not long ago too.
L:  Oh, is that good?  That's Disney isn't it, or is it?
R:  Yeah, but it's not --
L:  It's not little kid Disney though.
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  Okay.
R:  No, that's the only bad thing about it.  I mean it's a good love story.
L:  Is it?
R:  Yeah, it really is.
L:  Oh.  I like those feel good stories.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, I like love stories but it's hard -- I mean, I have to watch them on my own late at night after everybody's in bed [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] I know the feeling.  I used to do that years ago but -- well, there's still some things though.  I'll have the TV on and if he's home I'll turn the channel.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like on Lifetime or something, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I just turn the channel.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I don't --
L:  So, what -- what theaters do you go to, if you ever do go?
R:  I --
L:  Or you guys just never, ever go?
R:  Well, my husband and my son go but I don't go.
L:  Okay.  
R:  I honest- I don't go to the th- the last time I went to the movie theater was what?  Let me think what was that?  Um, Jima- jiman- what was that with -- Jumanji, Jim -- you know what I mean.  Help me out here now [LAUGH].
L:  Uh --
R:  You know the movie with Garth.  What's his name? [MN]
L:  Um --
R:  He played Mork.
L:  Oh, Robin Williams.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  Um --
R:  It was Jumanji or ...
L:  Uh --
R:  The [MN].
L:  I can't think of it.  Anyway so it's been years ago.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I mean --
R:  My son was, uh, a little, little young thing then.  That was the last movie I went to see.
L:  Oh my goodness, huh.
R:  [MN] Uh-huh.
L:  Um --
R:  But now my husband and my son go.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They go probably at least once a month.  They probably --
L:  Oh, do they really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  Now do they go -- do you guys have like AMC movie theaters or what are your theaters there?
R:  We just have a regular theater in our town.
L:  Oh, it's like a local one --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  Now, sometimes they do go to the AMC over in Middletown and stuff but that --
L:  We have a Dickin- you guys have Dickinson theaters?
R:  No, I've never heard that name.
L:  You haven't heard of that.  Okay.
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  Um, sometimes I buy these products and get free movie passes and so we'll go to movies for different reasons or I mean, just we'll have the passes and then like we look in the paper and go, "Okay, let's go see this" [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Are you on the RMC board?
L:  Yes.
R:  I am too [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That is too good.  I am going to post on there tonight.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] What was your name?
L:  Sheryl [LAUGH]
R:  I talked to Sheryl in Kansas tonight.
L:  [LAUGH] How funny.
R:  We got to talk about the movies.
L:  Now, how long have you been on that board?
R:  Three years.
L:  Really?  I just started last year and love it.
R:  I love it but I never really post.  I'm --
L:  I don't either.
R:  -- real quiet [LAUGH].
L:  I don't either.  I just read it.
R:  That's what I do [LAUGH].
L:  Yes, and this was a great thing I thought.
R:  Oh, I love it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I love to talk though.  I could talk to anybody.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, it's --
R:  I'm a talker.
L:  Really?  That's good.  I'm not as much so --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- but I mean, I don't mind [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, what else can we talk about with theaters and movies?  
R:  Now, I like Everybody loves Raymond.  Every Monday night me and my husband watch that together.
L:  Oh, you do.
R:  Yeah, that's my favorite show out there.
L:  Now, do you watch American Idol?
R:  No.
L:  Oh, that's --
R:  I've not watched that show at all.
L:  Huh, now we watch that and we watch the Bachelor [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I watch the Bachelor.  My husband doesn't watch it.
R:  Yeah, I watch the Bachelor some.
L:  So ...
R:  But I think that's all so fake.
L:  Yeah, it is a little bit fake.
R:  You know --
L:  I do agree.  It's fake.
R:  -- it's they -- they -- and I'm getting tired of all the reality shows.
L:  I know.  It -- It's getting really -- so and Fox has the worst ones I think.  They have, like, Mr. Personality with that deal where you can't even see their face.  
R:  Oh, see I haven't seen that.
L:  Oh.
R:  See I -- I like to watch Nick at Night.  You know, I love Lucy and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- I watch all the old shows [LAUGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that I grew up on [LAUGH].
L:  I know, we like 'em too.  Like today we were watching I Dream of Jeannie and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- what -- my husband likes the old shows [COUGH].
R:  Yeah, that's what I like a lot.  That's what I watch every night and that's when TV is the best, at night time.
L:  It is, it is.
R:  I watch --
L:  I agree 'cause, um, if you're home during the day, it's awful [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, well you see I have --
L:  It's all soap operas.
R:  -- I -- well, you see I don't watch soap operas so I have it on Nick at Night and I watch, um, Hazel in the morning and I watch, um, That Girl [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, is that on during the day?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Okay, okay.
R:  And what else, Leave It to Beaver and --
L:  Oh, I like Leave It to Beaver.
R:  -- I watch from eight thirty to twelve and then, um, oh, I can't think what show it is.  Oh, the gun -- Gunsmoke comes on.  I turn it off then.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I either watch the news or turn it off [LAUGH].
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Then I turn it back on to see what the Lifetime movie 'cause they do have good movies on in the afternoon.
L:  I like Lifetime too.
R:  No, I --
L:  And I actually like Oprah in the afternoon too.
R:  I do too but I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I never did -- I got away from them when I had a child and our rule was I didn't watch that kind of stuff with him around.
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  With young kids --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and then I've just never -- I just kind of stayed away from all them.  I don't like soap operas or --  Now I like Dr. Phil.
L:  I do too.  I do too.
R:  But my son don't.  He'll say, "Mum please turn that.  I don't like that man's voice" [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] He does have a funny voice.
R:  And I'll say, "Well, Chad Michael go to your bedroom" [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
