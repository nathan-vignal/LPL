R:  Hello?
L:  Hello [LAUGH].
R:  Hi, what's your name?
L:  Ruth.
R:  Ruth?  Where are you from?
L:  Ah, Indiana.
R:  Okay.  Um, I'm Nellie and I'm originally from Oregon, but I'm living in New York, but right now I'm in New Hampshire.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  So, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Ha- -- have you done this before?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.  This question's sort of lame.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But um, but -- but -- well -- we'll go through with it anyways.  Um, because --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- because we're that ki- -- those kinds of people.  Um, so ah do you prefer theater or video?
L:  Um, [LAUGH] depends.  There's -- there's times that I definitely like to go to the theater without the family and the children, but there's other --
R:  Do you have kids?
L:  Yeah.  I have two kids.
R:  Oh, sweet.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  How old?
L:  Four and two.
R:  Oh.  Yeah --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that -- well, that must be pretty hard though, I mean like with a two year old, like there are very few things that you probably could take --
L:  Yeah.  Well, she's -- she's -- she really likes to watch movies --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we don't let her very often, so she thinks it's a big deal the few times we like let her go see a -- I think we -- we took her to see Ice Age and she just --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- she sat--
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- there and she just loved it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But there's definitely --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- times that you -- my husband and I like to go out without the children and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and ah you know see a -- see a movie, but there's also times that we just like to rent a movie as a family and stay home, make popcorn.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, it's more of a social occasion that way, I think.
L:  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  How about you?
R:  Um.  I mean, I'm probably the same way.  I mean, I could really do either way, like I've been to some Indian movies --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um at theaters there and there they have a lovely way of sort of blending the two, so it's sort of like you're just sitting alone in your living room and like talking and --
L:  Oh, nice.
R:  -- and eating and like yelling things to the people on the screen.  It's just like a very active sort of engagement with the movie, so --
L:  Oh, nice.
R:  I d- -- I don't really care for Indian musicals that much themselves, but the -- the whole atmosphere --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is -- is awesome.  What -- what's the last movie that you saw?
L:  Oh, my word.  Um, my mind just went blank.  Ten -- how to lose a guy in ten days -- you know --
R:  What was it?
L:  How to lose a guy in ten days.
R:  Oh, was that good?
L:  Oh, it was so funny.
R:  Who's in it?
L:  Matthew McConaughey and ah [SIGH] oh, I can't remember that girl's name.  Goldie Hawn -- her daughter.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I -- I know who you're talking about.
L:  I think that was --
R:  Bea -- some -- [several inaudible words] --
L:  Oh what -- I can't remember her name.  It was so funny, though.
R:  Oh, cool.  Now, I haven't seen that one.  I've been, um, I saw -- in the theater I last saw A Mighty Wind um the one by Christopher Guest.
L:  I did not see that.
R:  Have you seen like Waiting For Guffman or um --
L:  N n.
R:  Or Spinal Tap?
L:  No.
R:  It's the same guy who does that.  They're mockumentaries.
L:  Ah.
R:  And um, they're pretty amusing.  Um ... but this one wasn't nearly as good as the others, so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I don't know.  But it was at -- it was -- at least it was sort of a free ticket, but --
L:  [LAUGH] I'm actually supposed to go to the movies tomorrow.
R:  Oh, what are you going to see?
L:  Ah, X Men.
R:  Oh, yeah, the d- --
L:  The new one.
R:  Oh, right.
L:  Pardon me?
R:  That just came out, right?
L:  I think so.  My husband and his friend -- we're doing -- ah, going out with another couple, so men get to choose this time.
R:  Oh, they -- they didn't choose the Matrix?
L:  No.  No.  They want to see X Men.  So [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, okay.  You -- did you get to choose last time?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, we take turns.
R:  Oh, that's neat.
L:  I'm trying to think.  There was something after How to lose a guy in ten days and I just cannot remember it for the life of me.
R:  It must -- must not have been too --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It must not have been very good.  I can't remember it.
R:  What have you seen on video?
L:  Oh, I'm trying to think.  We just bought the Treasure Planet DVD today.
R:  Oh.
L:  I don't know, the kids got twenty minutes into it and they just didn't -- weren't into it so --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- k- -- um, we like we oh have like almost all the new DVDs, we're big --
R:  Oh really?
L:  Yeah.  We're big movie people [LAUGH].
R:  Do you -- how often do you watch them, I mean like to buy a DVD like how many times do you think you have to watch it in order to make your -- your money's worth?
L:  Um, at least five, four or five.
R:  And -- really?  And you'd watch --
L:  Oh, my h- -- my husband, he will watch the same movie like I swear like ten times.
R:  Wow.
L:  Have you ever seen Waterworld?
R:  Never.
L:  Oh, my word.  It is the stupidest movie.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You can imagine.  He's watched it like probably twelve times.
R:  Wow.
L:  It drives me nuts.
R:  W- --
L:  I cannot stand that movie and it's like his favorite movie.
R:  Well, growing up, we didn't have very many movies, so those I would watch over and over again, like um the Indiana Jones ones, I could watch those forever --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that sort of thing, but um -- but, yeah, I don't think I could -- I mean especially now like there are other things I'd rather do with my time, I guess than watch a movie I've already seen.
L:  Yeah.  I'm -- I can understa- -- do you -- do you have a f- -- are you married?  Do you have kids?
R:  No.  I just graduated from college in June.
L:  Wow.  Um --
R:  So, I'm so sort of I guess, rambling.
L:  As a -- as a family, there're, well with children and as part of a family, it's a lot easier just to be -- you don't have to worry about finding a babysitter, this and that, so it's a lot easier just to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- stay home and pop in a DVD than it is --
R:  No, you're right.
L:  -- to do anything.  My husband, he's big on movies.
R:  Yeah.  Where do you live in Indiana?
L:  South Bend.  Notre Dame.
R:  Notre -- okay.  How -- all right.  How many people are in that um city?
L:  Um, approximately two hundred thousand.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  I think at -- at last count.
R:  Do you -- do you feel that there's a lot to do in the city?
L:  No.
R:  No, not at all?
L:  Not.  Not really.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Football season there is Notre Dame football, but --
R:  Ew, uh-huh.
L:  -- beyond that there's -- there's not that much to do here [LAUGH].
R:  I'd really love to see, oh gosh, because I mean like living in New York, if there are football teams, I'm sort of unaware of them [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Like um just like college or -- or high school or anything like that.  I like to see non-professional, actually --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- more, so um but man, I mean having Notre Dame there, that must be intense, just during that season.
L:  It -- it is.  I think a lot of people, they get -- it's just -- it turned out to be a -- it's very hard for people that live in South Bend to get tickets if you're not um alumni students, faculty staff, whatever.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it just ends up being a huge traffic nightmare [LAUGH].
R:  Do -- are the students guaranteed?
L:  Um, no.  No.
R:  Wow.
L:  They -- you have to stand in line.  They start selling tickets at like seven in the morning and people are lined up for like two days --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- to get tickets.
R:  Wow, that's intense.  Are -- are you from that area, like --
L:  Oh, yeah.  Born and raised.
R:  Did you end up going to college there, or --
L:  Um, I -- actually, I st- -- Notre Dame has a sister school, St. Mary's College --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I started out there, but I wasn't happy, so I went to -- USB, which is -- it's part of Indiana University.
R:  Oh, great.  Yeah.
L:  It works well [LAUGH].  It's a very nice -- nice campus, w- -- the quality of the -- of the faculty is -- is very --
R:  W- -- at USB?
L:  USB.
R:  Hm.
L:  The quality is v- -- it's a good school.
R:  Why -- why were you um unhappy with the other college?
L:  Um, the quality it -- they have an image they try to uphold and it's not -- the quality of the education was not sufficient.  It did not challenge me at all.  I -- I needed to be challenge and needed to feel like I was learning something.
R:  Good.  Good.
L:  Which I've been so happy with my choice [LAUGH].
R:  Wonderful.  I mean, I know [SIGH] a lot of people who've been sort of disappointed with where they were going but just -- I mean like myself, like I was -- I thought of transferring, but how do you know if where you're transferring to is going to be any better, is the only thing.  So, but it's wonderful that you found a place that was -- that was so much better.
L:  Where did you go to school?
R:  Um, I'm actually there right now.  I went to school at Dartmouth --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- in um in New Hampshire, so I'm just up visiting for the weekend and --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- I'm very glad that I graduated in about [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know.  You look around and everyone looks so young and innocent and protected and I know that that was me and I'm just so glad that that's no so much the case anymore.
L:  [LAUGH] I was just -- I'm applying for the Masters program and ah I was just --
R:  In -- in what?
L:  Ah, MBA.
R:  Oh, great.  Mhm.
L:  I was just on campus today and they had their new student orientation and everyone looks like a baby --
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  -- I was -- I was walking through there and I could not believe these people would be going to college, they looked so young.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  It was so funny [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  So vulnerable and yeah, I mean the weekend that we're up here right now is supposed to be like set aside for debauchery and drinking and all that stuff --
L:  [LAUGH] Oh no.
R:  -- and it's just -- it's almost bizarre to see these --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I -- I guess like children sort of playing with the small freedom that they have.
L:  Oh.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it was great [LAUGH].
L:  That's so -- it's so funny.  I don't know.  People, they just -- I -- I go back to like my high school and everyone looks like they're like ten years old --
R:  [LAUGH] Are you -- are your kids going to go to that same high -- like, based on where you're living now, are they going to go to the same schools that you went to?
L:  M-
