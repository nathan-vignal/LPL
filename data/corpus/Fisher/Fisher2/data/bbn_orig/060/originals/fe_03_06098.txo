R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.  My name's Gail Leach.
R:  Hi Gail.  I'm Noreen Jenkins.
L:  Noreen?
R:  Yes.
L:  Yes, ah, and the topic today is how do you get your current, ah, news.
R:  I get most of my news from the newspaper because I attend school and usually by the time I arrive home -- and I volunteer a lot, um, so I -- I get the newspaper and I get it from the -- the newspapers and then just a little bit from the, ah, media, um, over the television.  How about yourself?
L:  Ah, most of mine I get from the television, ah, when I -- when I get home from work and -- and a lot of times I -- I -- I have a computer and I -- view -- there's like newspapers on the computer.
R:  Oh, I do too.  I subscribe.
L:  Oh, you do?
R:  Uh-huh.  I do to.  I -- I -- I get the alerts.
L:  Oh, yeah.  But, also you c- -- like I -- there's -- there -- like I l- -- I live in Florida and yeah, I get -- ah, I go to Games World sometimes so I get the, ah, the newspaper on the internet from Games World.  I -- you really don't have to go buy it, you can just -- you can go right to it -- 
R:  Oh, I -- 
L:  -- on the internet.  Did you know that?
R:  Yeah, but for us it's -- and for our -- for our newspaper it's a limited information but I get the, ah -- I -- I live in Illinois.
L:  Oh.
R:  And, ah, I -- I -- you can, ah, for our paper you can go to the website and you can get -- you can customize it for alerts, like for news items that you are really interested in -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and they can send you the bullets -- 
L:  The -- 
R:  -- they can send you, um, a daily -- of items that you're interested in and they can also send you any news alerts for any specific things that you're interested in.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  And that works out really well too 'cause then you can get those in addition whether it's entertainment or, um, current events or, you know, pol- politics or -- or whatever.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Other things that are of interest to you and that -- that helps also.  So, I -- I -- I receive those and also the news stations.  Um, they have those also here so you can get those from the news stations also.  Like, Fox here -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- Fox Net [inaudible] has -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- that.  So, I get -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah, the alerts from Fox and, um, the Chicago Tribune.
L:  Yes, well, I watch the news every night at eleven.  I like to keep up on current events and what's going on in the world and what -- and what -- what do you think about the -- the SARS in China.  Isn't that awful?
R:  Well, I contracted a virus from a blood transfusion in seventy four that symptoms didn't manifest for twenty years that's a Asian virus.
L:  Yes.
R:  So, I, um, was not astonished by SARS because -- 
L:  Oh, you wasn't?
R:  No, I was not because of the virus that I had was very rare.  It causes paralysis and is -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- an Asian virus and I got it from a blood transfusion in seventy four and symptoms didn't +manifest, ah, manifest until ninety four.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, when I heard about SARS I was not at all astonished because I thought, ah, there are viruses out there that people don't even know about.  That's what I was told by the Disease Control Centre because nobody even knew what I was talking about with the virus that I had.  It took them a number of years to even track the virus to find out what I had.  They just -- they tried to say I had MS and I knew I didn't have MS 'cause I had a cousin that died from MS.  So, I knew I didn't have MS.  So, it took -- it took a -- a -- a -- and -- and I went to the University of Chicago which is one of the best hospitals for research.  I challenged their diagnosis so, um, I know that there were other viruses out there, um, and so SARS is probably one of those viruses that they were talking about.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, ah, and there are other viruses that's out there and so, ah, and a lot of them are, ah, not, you know, from the US, they're, ah, from Asia.  And --  
L:  Oh.
R:  -- ah, the virus I have is less than three thousand people in the United States.  But, now -- at the time they weren't filtering for blood.  In seventy four they weren't doing that.  That was bef- -- you know, and so, you know, there wasn't much I could do about it.  But, um, [MN] um, and so now I'm use- -- ah, yeah, I'm in a motorized chair.  But, um, to have something that's slowly -- you know, you'd lose your mobility over twenty years -- I thought I had arthritis, you know [LAUGH] at first.
L:  Mm.
R:  And slowly and slowly I was using -- losing the use of my legs.  But, um, um -- 
L:  I didn't know that there are a lot of viruses out there.  Well, what about the flu shot?  Does that help?
R:  No, and I don't think I would take a flu shot because -- I don't know, it's like the Polio vaccine.  They're -- they said that the Pol- Polio vaccine there's a lot of MS people.  Th- that MS was caused by Polio vaccine from the boomers for getting, um, ah, ah, Pol- -- the Polio sh- -- ah, vaccine.
L:  Oh.
R:  That's -- that's where the MS came from.  So, I -- I don't think I would ever take a flu shot.
L:  Oh, that's where MS came from?
R:  That's what they -- that's one of the, ah, theories of MS is the flu shot.
L:  Oh.  Oh.
R:  Ah, 'cause you don't know what's in there or how that affects you.  'Cause the body has -- was naturally designed to resist certain diseases that are not man made and any man made virus is, um, your body is not designed to resist.  It's d- designed to resist anything that's natural by nature.  That's how God designed it.
L:  Oh.
R:  That's why -- you know, like if you cut yourself it automatically heal right?
L:  Right.
R:  So, 'cause that's how it's -- it's designed.
L:  Right, but -- 
R:  But, if you get something that's artificial it won't heal because God didn't design it for something that's artificial.  That's not natural. 
L:  Oh.  Well, I take the flu shot every year.
R:  Do you?
L:  Yeah, and it really helps.
R:  Well, I don't catch -- catch colds or virus -- 
L:  But, I've heard several people say that they wouldn't take it, that they get sick from it.  But, I haven't -- not gotten sick once from the flu shot.  Not -- 
R:  Well -- 
L:  -- even a minute.
R:  I have a friend.  She takes the flu shot every year and she said that the people that get sick from the flu shot have already, ah, usually have a cold or the beginning stages of a cold.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  No -- 
R:  And -- 
L:  -- I've heard several people say that they've gotten very sick from the flu shot.
R:  That's her theory -- 
L:  And they blame it on the flu shot but according to statistics, ah, the flu shot is -- doesn't give you the flu like people say it does -- 
R:  That's what she said.
L:  That's -- 'cause I read on the internet that it doesn't.  Maybe it did years ago because I know a friend of mine, he took the flu shot and he -- I don't know if he -- I was there when he took it and, ah, he started getting sick on the way home.  I don't know if it was psychological or what.  But, he -- 
R:  Well, she said they already have the beginning stages of a cold.  That she's been getting one for years and she said that, and that's her -- her belief.  She said they've already had the beginning stages of a cold and when they have the flu shot it makes the cold manifest and they think that it's the flu shot.
L:  Mm.
R:  And I said, "Well, maybe that's true, but" -- 
L:  So, you've been in a wheelchair since you had this shot?
R:  No.  Ahah.  I've just used the motorized chair for the last four years 'cause it takes -- it was -- it's -- it's progressive.
L:  Oh, it is?
R:  So -- uh-huh.  So, I didn't have symptoms until ninety four.  I just, you know, had like aching in my joints in ninety four and then -- 
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  -- ninety five and then as it progressed on and you know, I started dragging my feet in gate patterns and was walking slower.  You know, just -- you know, things just progressed. 
L:  Oh, and -- 
R:  And I had trouble climbing the stairs in my house and things -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- like that, you know, just -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- kind of -- and then [several inaudible words] in Illinois and I live near Chicago.  The weather is --  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, it's either cold -- 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- or hot and you know, it's extreme temperatures.  So, you know, I panicked.  I thought maybe it was the weather and different things -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- like that.  So, you know, you try to -- 
L:  Well, I'm so glad that this war is over, huh?
R:  Yeah.  I -- I -- 
L:  In Iraq.
R:  I am too.  I -- I am too, um -- 
L:  Well, I -- the -- the most of it's over.  I still think they still have some problems over there.
R:  I -- I -- I think so too and, ah, I have a -- a -- my childhood friend, her son's there and, ah, she hasn't heard from him lately and, um, you know, I just -- you know, we -- 
L:  Oh, my son is, ah, in the airforce and he had to leave about a month ago.  I -- they didn't tell him where he was going.  He said that when he got -- he said he would email me but I haven't heard from him in a month.
R:  Oh, really?  That's what she said.  She hadn't heard from -- 
L:  I haven't heard -- 
R:  -- her son.
L:  -- from him in a month and I probably won't hear from him.  I don't know.
R:  And she said that, um, she -- she hadn't heard from her son.  I wrote him.  Um, he had -- 
L:  Well, no good -- no news is good news -- 
R:  Right.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  She -- 
L:  But -- 
R:  -- asked me to --
