L:  Hello!
R:  Hello!
L:  [LAUGH] Hi my name is Lana, who are you?
R:  My name is Gwen [LAUGH] I'm from Virg- --
L:  Nice to meet you!
R:  Nice to meet you!   Where are you from?
L:  [LAUGH] Ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Baton Rouge, Louisiana [MN].
R:  Oh okay!  [MN] I'm from Virginia, Hampton, Virginia. [SIGH] 
L:  Cool. [LAUGH]
R:  Nice. [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, well I guess we have to talk about movies, huh? [LAUGH]
L:  Sure!  It'd be great because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I just went to see the Matrix today.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh you did?  [SIGH] Oh how --
L:  [LAUGH] Perfect, yes.
R:  How did you like it?
L:  Ah, quite honestly, um, the first one -- I mean, the first one just blew me away --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  -- 'cause the story was so original, you know.  And, um, [MN] [LIPSMACK] I really -- I didn't expect the sequel to live up to the first one because they rarely do.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, they can, yeah.
L:  But I was --  I -- I was hoping for something a little bit different [SIGH] like, I mean, there was nothing -- I mean, of course it's not going to be original [NOISE] because --
R:  Mm.
L:  --it's -- it's -- it's -- it's using all the same ideas from the old one, you know what I'm saying?
R:  Right.
L:  I mean it's the same [NOISE] premise, the same characters in all the stuff, so you know what's going on.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They can't surprise you.  [SIGH] But it's like, um,  I don't know, maybe if they would have had some more surprises in it, or something --
R:  Right.
L:  -- like nobody we like died. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh really? [LAUGH] Okay! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Good! [LAUGH]
L:  So [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't want to give it away for you. [LAUGH]
R:  That's okay. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it was just a little predictable, I --
R:  Oh --
L:  --think I --
R:  -- okay.
L:  They could have thrown --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- some twists and turns in, just kinda like made us go ooh and ah more! [NOISE]
R:  Okay.
L:  I think! [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] [MN] Yeah I had -- just had a little hard time understanding it the first time I saw it I thought it was a good movie.  I mean the -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- first one --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I just had a hard time understanding it, just trying to keep up with the concept.  I liked the special effects and everything, um 
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I did enjoy the movie itself so I'm --
L:  Now --
R:  -- thinking [NOISE] [MN]
L:  -- the special effects were a killer --
R:  [MN]
L:  --in this movie, which I -- I expected nothing but. [NOISE] [MN]
R:  Yes, uh-huh.  But I can't wait to see the second one but I haven't had time to go see it yet.  Of course it just came out and I know my, um, son has seen it and I think my daughter is going to go see it, but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I do want to go see it, but it probably [LAUGH] will be a while before I get to. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh!
R:  You know.
L:  Well, they're, gon- -- they're, um, gonna have a third one as well.
R:  Oh are they --
L:  So 
R:  -- really?
L:  Yes.  Make sure you stay through all the credits and you'll see a preview for the third one. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh my heaven!
L:  But it's a very, very short preview, so a- --
R:  Is it?
L: -- afterwards we were like, gosh, we waited all this time for this? [LAUGH]
R:  Oh!
L:  [LAUGH] The whole theater cleared out! [LAUGH]
R:  Was it ?
L:  And we were just sitting there and sitting there waiting! [MN]
R:  [MN]
L:  But I mean still, I would -- I would go to see it but --
R:  Yes, I will.  I'll make sure that I'll sit and watch and see but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- usually it's like the people want to hurry up to get out to get their cars to leave [SIGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] [several inaudible words]
R:  So, was that -- that Kevin -- what is him name that's in there? No --
L:  Mm.
R:  --this star of it?
L:  [NOISE] Keanu Reeves.
R:  -- that's it, yeah!
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, he's hot! [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, he's still in there okay --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- 'cause he was good last time.
L:  Mhm.  And the same character that plays opposite him Tragie[?] she's in there too.
R:  Is she? Good.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  [COUGH]
L:  And Morpheus is still in there. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's just the three basic main characters still and --
R:  Are they?
L:  -- oh, and the -- the agent Smith?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [MN] The bad guy.  Yeah, he's in there.
R:  Okay.
L:  But that's like all the carryovers from the first one.  [PAUSE] Um   They introduced a new character; Jayda Pinkett Smith, you know, Will Smith's [NOISE] wife?
R:  Oh, okay, all right.
L:  And, um, [NOISE] she's all right, she's pretty good but 
R:  Is she?
L:  Mhm. Mm.
R:  [MN] So what's the main plot of it this time?  Or  
L:  [LIPSMACK] [MN]
R:  Without giving away the whole thing! [MN]
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] Mhm, let's see. [SIGH] Well, it shows you, um, the battle, of them against the machines with Neo kind of leading the group out of the warren.  [SIGH] Um, now, and it also [NOISE] goes into a scene how Morphe- Morpheus brought him to the oracle and [several inaudible words] visibly is a prophet and, you know, it -- whatever she says is true and blah, blah, blah.  [SIGH] Well, [NOISE] it shows the different views, like from everybody, a- all the other different, like, captains of all the different ships, um, [LIPSMACK] besides Morpheus, [SIGH] what they thought about it.  And they though Morpheus was a crock. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH] So they thought he was [LAUGH] crazy [NOISE] 'cause --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- he believes in the oracle all [LAUGH] this stuff and   I don't know, um, [LIPSMACK] it just kinda had a lot more people in this movie --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- like you saw the whole [MN] -- what's the name of that -- the last, um, [LIPSMACK] human city?   Zion.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  It shows you like all the citizens of Zion and then their [NOISE] homes and things like that.  It was --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- really dark.
R:  Okay.
L:  [SIGH] But, um, let me see. [PAUSE] [MN] Basically the -- the machines had, um, found a way [MN] -- had -- had found the city and they were coming to attack it.
R:  Oh.
L:  So they had to save it. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh wow!
L:  [LAUGH] And save all of humankind, um, at the same time. [LAUGH]
R:  Great! [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH] [LAUGH]
R:  That sort of g- -- reminds me about the old -- well, I mean I -- I grew up in the seventies, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it sort of reminds me of the Star War movies when they first came out.
L:  Oh, Star Wars.  I thought -- 
R:  That's e- --
L:  -- you were going to say The Terminator. [LAUGH]
R:  No!  No, no! [LAUGH] Well I guess --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- uh, I guess if you want to say that in the eighties then, but it sorta --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- sounds like the Star War movies then a- and then of course The Terminator.  But yeah, [SIGH] of course, the special effects are just much more [LAUGH] up to date --
L:  Oh yeah!
R:  -- and more advanced and everything.  [SIGH] I just couldn't believe it when I saw it last time; I'm like, "Wow!" [LAUGH]
L:  I know!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well they use some innovative themes.  I mean they -- they used --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] -- uh, this certain -- I forgot what it's called, but this certain type of, um, shot that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- y- -- was never used before.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean that's the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- first time that it's ever been shown.  How -- you know how they -- like, they'll catch a -- a -- they'll stop the -- the frame and then they'll do a pan around?
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] Well they used like a whole bunch of different cameras in a circular motion. 
R:  Oh, no!
L:  And they just keep -- they catch a bunch of frames.  Yeah.  I -- I've -- well I got the -- I've got that movie, so I saw all --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the behind the scenes. [LAUGH]
R:  Great!
L:  Plus --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I wanna g- -- I'd like to go to film school when I get -- um, when I graduate so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  --I'm like -- I'm all into that kinda stuff. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's great.  Are you in, um, college right now, or high school? 
L:  [SIGH] Uh -- I go to LSU but I'm sitting out this semester.
R:  Are you?  Oh, okay.
L:  Mhm.  Yes, I need money, so  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.  So you're [LAUGH] working to get the money then. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yes.
R:  Yes?
L:  Yes, I just started in a new job I really like.
R:  Oh, you did?
L:  Um -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I'm doing traffic reports on the radio! [MN]
R:  Oh, very good! [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  And it's fun! [LAUGH]
R:  So are you, um, doing the helicopter?  Like going around in the helicopter, or are you just reading 'em  or? [NOISE]
L:  No, actually I'm just -- I'm in the studio --
R:  Great.
L:  We have -- um, the way we get the traffic is, we have reports that come up, like from the police officers --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- about accidents and --
R:  Oh, --
L:  -- things.
R:  -- great!
L:  Then we have a plane that flies around and gives us, um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] ah, information regarding delays all over the city. 
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  Then we actually have someone on the road too --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- who, um, like aids the -- the person in the plane.  A- -- or sometimes [NOISE] he c- -- he can't fly because of the weather or like the pilot has been drugged up from something; [MN] he's been having like, dental work or something -- or sinus infections. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Oh! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Gracious! [LAUGH]
L:  So --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- yeah, otherwise, you know, we wouldn't know about a delay, --
R:  Definitely.
L:  -- 'cause it's not going to show up as an accident.  Mm.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Definitely.
L:  Mm.  [NOISE] But no, I'm just the voice in the studio. [LAUGH]
R:  But that -- that's important voice in the studio, so we know -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, people know which roads to avoid and where not to go. Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Definitely -- definitely.
R:  Yeah, that's great.
L:  And I like it a lot.  Mm [SIGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  And how did you find out about this research study?  I'm just curious.
L:  Oh, my ex boyfriend sent me an email. I wonder how he found out. [LAUGH]
R:  Did he? Oh, okay. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  All right. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] How did you?
R:  Um, off of a site for refunders. [LAUGH]
L:  Ah!
R:  Yeah.  So, I didn't know, 'cause I know there's a lot of refunders that had signed up for it -- as far as -- um, we sign up for a lot of surveys and different things like that and it's really neat, it's interesting.  So  [SIGH]  And I saw this and I thought, "Well this is interesting too, so why not do that?" so 
L:  Cool!
R:  This is like the second one I've got,  In the first one I did the per- -- the poor p- person didn't know anything about it.
L:  Oh!
R:  [SIGH] Didn't know how he got the phone call, didn't know who turned his name in, didn't know nothing and I'm like, um 
L:  You're kidding me!
R:  Well, somebody 
L:  Maybe it was somebody who lived with him --
R:  I don't know.
L:  -- who did it.
R:  Yeah.  I said, "I don't know but obviously somebody filled your name out, had given all this information and signed you up to do this and "
L:  I can't believe that --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- they press yes, you know -- 
R:  May --
L:  -- go ahead and participate. [LAUGH]
R:  Right! I mean I certainly wouldn't do it if I --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- had a robot ask, or, you know, that voice asking me to press --
L:  Oh yeah! I'd --
R:  -- yes. [LAUGH]
L:  I'd be like, click! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So then I was wondering well maybe he one of the students but he lived in Boston --
L:  Maybe he was lonely! [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I don't know -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- what he was but it was --
L:  [LAUGH]  Maybe his other --
R:  -- really funny --
L:  -- personality signed him up.
R:  [NOISE] There you go --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [LAUGH] he just didn't remember.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But it was really funny 'cause I certainly wouldn't have done it.  I would have hung up in a heartbeat. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Funny!  What topic d- -- what topic did you all have to talk about?
R:  [MN] It was if you -- if you were going to be --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- receiving a million dollars anonymously [NOISE] --
L:  Oh I got that one too! [LAUGH]
R:  You did?
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah! [LAUGH]
R:  I thought that was neat! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] It was interesting! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, it was really good.
L:  But you couldn't -- [NOISE] but you couldn't, uh, see your friend again --
R:  Right 
L:  --is that --
R:  Right --
L:  -- the stor- --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah 
R:  Couldn't see him or talk to him or anything, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] That was really neat, so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it -- that maybe --
L:  [LAUGH] [MN] buy a nut house.
R:  [MN] [SIGH]
L:  Huh?
R:  Maybe that was the question of the week or something or the day or something --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That was cute! [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.
R:  [MN]
L:  Are we're [MN] also to talk about whether we prefer, um -- 
R:  [MN] Oh!
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] going to the theatre --
R:  [SIGH] Right.
L:  -- or at home. [LIPSMACK]
R:  I don't mind going to the theater but sometimes it's just more convenient if I stay at home but --
L:  Oh, of course.
R:  -- then you don't get to see 'em, [SIGH] you know, when they first come out either.  So it just depends --
L:  Right.
R:  --on how bad I really want to see the movie, like this Matrix Two I'll probably -- like there's a couple of them out now I really want to see so I'll probably go ahead to the theater and see 'em.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] You know and um --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- wait.
L:  Well, I think there's something just so special about the -- the -- the whole theater experience.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, I mean --
R:  Right.
L:  -- with the big screen and like --
R:  Yes. [NOISE]
L:  -- you get all these angles, especially like, if it's like --
