R:  -- n- n- -- games.
L:  Okay, you'll -- 
R:  So --
L:  -- um, do you -- 
R:  -- d- do you play them?  [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah, I do.  I play 'em -- um, I do some.  Um, my sixteen year old son plays them a whole lot more than I do.
R:  Oh, does he have --
L:  Um -- 
R:  -- like a -- like a computer game or does he have like a Play Station?
L:  Well, he has a Play Station but he does, um, games on the internet.  I was trying to think of what his websites are he uses and then he has games that he does on -- 
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- CD rom, so he does those internet games and -- and CD roms that he puts in the computer.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Um, so he plays a lot more than I do but I do still play.  I like to go to, um, [several inaudible words] dot com.
R:  Uh-huh.  Oh --
L:  And also I -- 
R:  -- I've done that.
L:  Oh, you have?  I play -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- my favorite is Family Feud.  That's fun.
R:  Oh, how fun.  I've played, ah, Wheel of Fortune there.
L:  Wheel of Fortune.  Okay.  Um -- 
R:  It's really good.
L:  -- and then occasionally I'll do that and then, um, um, [several inaudible words] another one that's kind of good but, um, and then we'll play, um, oh, it's kind of like a Scrabble game.  I forgot the name of it.  It's really good -- 
R:  I think I know what you're talking about.  I -- 
L:  Yeah, well you have to -- 
R:  -- I -- it has a special name.  It's, like, different from Scrabble but similar.
L:  Yeah.  And you have to, like, make so many words, you get points and -- 
R:  Yeah.  [MN] 
L:  They -- they get on fire when they get at the bottom.
R:  Yeah.  'Cause -- 
L:  Yeah, I -- 
R:  -- they're kind of addicting.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.  I forgot what -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's called.  But, we, ah -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we play that sometimes together.
R:  Mm, that's fun.
L:  Yeah, so --
R:  M- my boyfriend, ah -- 
L:  -- he does it a lot more.
R:  -- sounds like h- how your son plays.  He has all the games and plays Play Station, plays Nintendo, always gets, like, gets to the console when it comes out and really into gaming and that sort of thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, he makes fun of me 'cause the only game I'll play on Play Station is Rug Rats.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, really, Rug Rats?  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Yeah.  It's so easy --
L:  Well -- 
R:  -- and it's fun.  But, um, I --
L:  Oh, what -- 
R:  -- don't like, like, the shooting up games 'cause they're just too difficult to learn.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It takes too long and I don't have that much time, so I want something --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- easier to play and that's why those [inaudible] games are so good.  They're so easy to --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to learn.
L:  When I was younger I could play Nintendo all night long.  You know, back -- 
R:  Oh, me too.
L:  -- that was back in the Nintendo days and the [inaudible] --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- days and all that.  But -- 
R:  Totally.  Yeah.  Super Mario -- 
L:  Now you're -- it's too exhausting and you can't the games are more difficult.  You know, it used to be like just, um, Mario, yeah.  And -- 
R:  Ah -- 
L:  -- you know, that was like the big game and stuff.  Now it's gotten so complicated that --  
R:  Yeah, there're so many more buttons now actually --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I just don't want to learn that, you know, it seems like such a waste of time at that point.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I have four year old twins and they -- they play, ah, a little bit.  I don't like them playing, you know, as much but I [several inaudible words] girl and then my boy doesn't play as much.  Um, my girl plays a little bit more and they have, um, preschool software like Leap Frog and, um, [MN] oh, Micky Mouse Toddler and different -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- games like that, you know -- 
R:  That's cool.
L:  -- learning games, yeah.  And they'll play those.  We've tried the internet games with them, like Scooby Doo and, um, different ones, ah, like [several inaudible words] Nickelodeon dot com.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, and we tried those but, um, sometimes, oh you know, like, you know, the game will -- I don't know how -- you know, get stuck or you're still having problems.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's not the internet games, I don't think, and if you play, um, on the internet they're not as good as the CD rom games because it's like they have more technical difficulty -- 
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- you know, than, um, the CD roms so -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And there's nothing worse than getting, you know -- going on a game and getting, you know, past the first level and then -- 
R:  Yeah, and losing it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, and then losing -- 
R:  Something like that.
L:  -- it and -- you know?
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  It's really --
R:  My cousins --
L:  -- frustrating.
R:  -- do something on line.  I'm really not sure what it's called.  It's really a big deal at their school where you have, um, like animals that you -- that are fake animals but you can create them.  They're like -- it's a little bit like, um, [MN] oh, what was that Pokemon card trading game? 
L:  I know what you're talking about.  They're, um -- 
R:  [SIGH] I can't remember what it's -- 
L:  -- they're called -- let me see, we did it before they were, um, [MN] I can't remember either but they're -- but, well it was like -- it's been a few years but we had -- you remember Moby Fish?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You have a fish that you could -- and you had to feed him or something or he would die.  Mine eventually died 'cause I ignored him for like a week and two weeks.  And -- 
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- he was floating.  Yeah.  One day when I got home I found he was floating. 
R:  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] On my screen, you know?  So, he was dead.  It was his -- the screen was his tank.
R:  Oh, no.
L:  Y- yeah.  So, anyway there's, um, you used to be able to -- oh, gosh, I can't remember the name of it, um --  
R:  Yeah, there was something like that on line where you would do it.
L:  Create a Pet or something along that line that, ah, we --  
R:  And you trade.  You trade, like, um -- I don't know, there's some kind of money system so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you can get better --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- characters.
L:  I think it's gotten more sophisticated.  But, a few years' ago they had, like, a tarantula.  It was called A Virtual Pet.
R:  Oh, yeah --
L:  But -- 
R:  -- okay --
L:  -- they've probably expanded it now -- 
R:  Yeah, you're right.  
L:  -- you know, but -- 
R:  You're right.
L:  It was Virtual Pet and, um, you know, you could -- oh, you know, you had to do things to feed it and -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and all that kind of stuff, you know, um, but I'm sure it's gotten a lot more complicated.
R:  Yeah, and --
L:  'Cause -- 
R:  -- that's the thing with any of the games, it's -- you know, you know you're going to get addicted to it if you start so it's a part of me just doesn't even start because of that.  Like there's -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- some games, um -- like a fun game looks like Grand Theft Auto but I won't play it because I know I'll play till I'm done, till I've finished it.  So -- and because that's how Nintendo used to be.  You know -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- you don't quit 'til you've solved Super Mario.
L:  Plus the -- 
R:  So -- 
L:  -- yeah, plus the -- the graphics are, um, so much more [inaudible], oh, more detailed these days.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, and the -- and there is a lot more functions.  You know, with Mario, I think all there was, was you had to jump and -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- jump and run.  I mean, there was -- you know -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there was like two or three commands and now there's like, you know, lots of commands and lots of different things you have to do and I can't remember up, down, you know, all the diff- -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- and then you had to push around, you know, like the control button -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- with the black key and it does something -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- funny and I mean, how -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- did we remember all that, you know?
R:  Yeah.  What do -- what did you, um, what did you like playing for arcade games?  Like the stand up games?
L:  [MN] Oh, arcade games?  Um, those will do with my age but Pacman.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] And, ah, my favorite was Centipede.
R:  Oh, really?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Do you remember that one?
R:  I was so bad at Centipede.
L:  Oh, I loved Centipede.  That -- 
R:  Really?  It was tough.  You --
L:  And you know -- 
R:  -- had the roller.  Didn't it have --
L:  Mrs Pak -- 
R:  -- the roller?
L:  -- Mrs Pacman was another one that I liked -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  You better like Keeper[?].  I was terrible at Keeper.  I used -- 
R:  I was bad at --
L:  -- to hate it because I'd -- 
R:  -- Keeper Two.  [inaudible] I was okay at.
L:  Oh, [inaudible].  I liked [inaudible], yeah.
R:  Yeah.  And there's a game Dig Dug I remember that was, ah, that was really -- 
L:  Oh, the dol- -- Dig Dug -- Dig --  
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ah, Dig Dug.
R:  Yeah, it was --
L:  I liked -- 
R:  -- really fun.
L:  -- Dig Dug, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, some of them definitely have a l- -- they don't have, um, like the internet or CD games anymore like the old ones that occasionally you'll see, like, for -- I think [several inaudible words] don't they?
R:  Oh, I think they do.
L:  Yeah -- 
R:  I think they do.
L:  -- so many of them they've -- 
R:  And like --
L:  -- saved [several inaudible words].
R:  -- Space Invaders.  They have things that are similar to it.
L:  Or what was the one that used to, um -- like Asteroid.  What was that --  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, it was like, um -- 
R:  Asteroid was difficult.  I --
L:  Oh, I forgot the one where -- 
R:  -- wonder if they have that still.
L:  -- um, [several inaudible words] was called Asteroid but you had -- you were in the -- ah, the outer space and you had to spin around and shoot the guys and -- 
R:  There was a Galatian[?] and Gallagher which were like that.
L:  Oh, [inaudible] were Gallagher -- 
R:  In space, yeah.
L:  -- I liked that.
R:  They still have those around like at airports and stuff.  Those are --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- fun to play.
L:  Well -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- my son does a lot of the, um, he does fantasy sports.
R:  Oh, like what?  Which ones?
L:  Well, like Baseball and, um -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- do you know [several inaudible words], he's in leagues.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  And I don't -- I don't know if they actually -- um, I've never seen him actually, like, play the g- games.  But, they -- they do their picks.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, like, they pick who they think's going to win.  It's like a -- it's like a league and --  
R:  Oh, I think --
L:  -- um -- 
R:  -- I know what you mean.
L:  Yeah.  Like, they -- they [MN] -- I don't remember, they, ah -- but, I've never seen him actually play the games.  [several inaudible words] was like, ah, hey, I don't know if it's like the game plays by itself or -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- or -- or -- what the whole deal is.  But, I mean, he's big, kind of, in the fantasy sports.  I can't really get him off the computer half the time because -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- he's in there, you know, and he'll say, "You know, I'll do this" [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- but he said that I was stupid and I didn't know my -- 
R:  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  -- picks very good and I can't, just because guess who's number --
R:  [NOISE] -- 
L:  -- one.  I'm beating the whole league --

R:  -- kids who do -- can do that. 
L:  -- criticizing me, they're like in last place.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.  He's been doing that for about four or five years now. 
R:  That's good.  I mean -- 
L:  Um -- 
R:  -- it helps kids memorize, I think, some of the numbers and things like that.  You get really good at memorizing data -- 
L:  Yeah, so that's -- 
R:  -- you know?  [NOISE] 
L:  -- what he does on line.  He plays, um, you know, the fantasy sports and that's --  
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's pretty -- that's pretty big.  They have a lot of different leagues and stuff.  A lot of people are into the fantasy sports and stuff.
R:  Yeah.  I've heard of that.  Like, they have some groups where you can win, like, a -- a -- a pot at the end or something like that.  They --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- all put in money and whatever.  At least for -- 
L:  But, then he'll play -- 
R:  -- baseball.  [NOISE] --

L:  The -- the old one was what?
R:  [MN] Pole Position that had the, ah, steering wheel -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [MN] That was fun.  Actually, that was a lot of fun.  [LAUGH]

R:  Oh, I wonder -- 
L:  It was really high tech in fact.
R:  Huh, was -- 
L:  But, I don't remember [NOISE] -- man, I'm like going [several inaudible words] ah, I'd like forty.  That was a big thing [NOISE] he'd collect -- [MN] he played that a lot.

R:  Yeah.
