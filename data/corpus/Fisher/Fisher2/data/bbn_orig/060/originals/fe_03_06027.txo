L:  Hi, I'm Mary Ellen.
R:  Hi, I'm Marg.
L:  How you doing, Marg?
R:  Well, okay. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, where are you located?
L:  I'm in Wisconsin.
R:  Oh, I'm in California. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, how --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- how's the weather in California?
R:  Well, it's been real nice day and we've been having kind of cool weather here, but it's, ah, kind of warmed up.
L:  Good.  
R:  Yeah, so what's -- what's your, um, take on affirmative action?  Have you had much experience with this?
L:  No.  
R:  Ah, [LAUGH] wh- where have --
L:  No, to be honest.
R:  Uh-huh.  What -- what's your impression of the topic?
L:  [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] Well, [SIGH] [SIGH] I don't really have much of an impression on it.  Um, I -- I understand the premise of it. 
R:  Mm.
L:  Um, and I remember even in the late sixties when we would go down to visit my gram in Florida, how there was, um, still black --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and white areas. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And signs posted. 
R:  Mm.
L:  And everything and, um, [LIPSMACK] water fountains --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and bathrooms, so I understand why they did it.  I don't know how successful it was.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- I've lived in some a- -- and worked in some, ah, [LIPSMACK] some big places.  I --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I lived and worked outside of New York City and, um, I -- I've worked out of Milwaukee and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't ha- -- work with, um, [LIPSMACK] that many people of different ethnic backgrounds --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that are, ah, like, I've never worked for a black person or a Hispanic person, so --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I don't -- I don't know how effective it is.
R:  Mhm.  Hm.
L:  How 'bout you?
R:  Well, [MN] I guess my experience is very different from that in -- ah, living in and working in Los Angeles for many years.  Um, I've certainly seen a lot of ins and outs of the whole situation and, um, I've [SIGH] -- I guess I would say that, ah, bottom line, I'm deeply commited to the notion of affirmative action, because I think that, um, there have been so many ways in which minorities have been, ah, deprived of opportunities to come forward to the level of their ability and that in fact that as whites we have benefited in- indirectly, or in some cases very directly, from the fact that others haven't had the opportunities that we have.  So, historically I guess I see it as being a debt that needs to be paid and think that this is probably somewhat, um, [LIPSMACK] an unusual perspective on it.  Um, I guess I've -- I've had a lot of experience in this and with this in the pre- -- places that I've worked.  Um, I have directly experienced, um, being sort of shunted aside in -- because opportunities were being provided to minorities persons and my reaction to it was, "Well, it's about time -- " [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  "-- that they're -- that some other groups had preference", you know, particularly in view of the fact that this community, um, has been, ah, ever increasing in the proportion of, ah, other ethnic groups.  So that, um, I mean, it's quite remarkable to me even today how in upper professional levels, how relatively few minority persons are, um, represented [inaudible] startling.
L:  And women.  And women too.  And the thing that kills me about all this is, um, really in the -- in the world population --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- whites are the minority.
R:  Mhm, mhm.  This is the truth.  And -- and I think that one of the aspects of this is that other countries can't recognize what the U.S. [LAUGH] is really about, as long as we're represented in major positions, ah, almost exclusively by whites.
L:  Exactly --
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  -- white male.
R:  Yeah.
L:  There's -- there's not enough, ah, women out there, so we're talking to Arab countries about treating their women with respect, but -- but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- how do we do it any differently?
R:  Mhm, mhm, yeah, i- it is quite --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- remarkable, isn't it? [LAUGH] 
L:  It is. 
R:  I remember speaking to the president of my organization at one time, and the subject of having women represented had come up, so he asked me, "Well, what proportion of women do you think we should have on our board?"  So I said, "Well, ah, how about fifty percent?"  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And he gave me this, [LAUGH] "You've got to be nuts" look [LAUGH].
L:  I know. 
R:  It's remarkable.  Yeah, so but it's not so easy to achieve in many ways.  Um, the --
L:  Oh, it isn't and -- and -- and I agree with you, um, about -- about the debt and it's remarkable, I think, especially in, um, my parents' day and my day --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that, um, that the true minorities that came from other countries --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that did so well.
R:  Mhm, mhm.  Well, there is this very interesting article I read a long time ago by James Baldwin, in which he spoke about, um, the progression of various European ethnics in the United States and how all these groups, um, sort of melted together and became white and forgot all about the fact that for generations they've been at each others throats in the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- old country.  But somehow, here they were all one big happy family as --
L:  Right.
R:  -- opposed to --
L:  The melting pot.
R:  -- everybody else.
L:  An American. 
R:  Yeah, they were the ones who melted, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, it didn't happen across the board.  
L:  But even -- even, um, the Asians do, um -- have made some vast contributions --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- here and, um, i- -- the hispanics --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in a more indirect --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, they'll do a lot of the work that -- that a superior white won't [LAUGH] do.
R:  Well, it's -- it's a hard, um, entry level work that, um, basically nobody really wants to do.
L:  Right.
R:  And, ah, it's -- it's a very interesting situation here in Los Angeles, that Latinos are now forty four percent of the population of Los Angeles county.  And, ah, in some situations you can, you know, count the number in upper levels on one or two fingers.  So, it's -- it --
L:  I don't get it.
R:  Well, partly when it comes to hispanics it's easier to explain because of the fact that so many are ver- -- relatively recent immigrants.  When it comes to African Americans, it's an entirely different situation --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because in most cases historically they've been here longer than almost any of the white ethnic groups. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, but [inaudible] so totally shot out of opportunities until quite recent time, you know, it's -- it -- and --
L:  And a lot of the hispanics don't really want to make this their country. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  A lot of them are just here to make the money that they can, to send home --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to help.  A lot don't even bother learning the language --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it's real hard to have a superior that doesn't -- who can't communicate with you.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it's -- it's out of the question.  Yeah, language is a -- a huge factor in the whole thing.  You know, my approach is that in -- in our area in California, I think that they should be requiring bilingual education, from the point of view that everybody would learn Spanish and English, because I think it's a huge economic asset to be able to communicate well with our nearest neighbors in South America. [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  Oh, gosh.  So, it's --
L:  In Mexico.
R:  Yeah, yeah, right.
L:  You know. 
R:  Yep, so it's a -- it's an interesting situation.  We -- we still experience, um, you know, despite the fact that there's so much mixing and mingling, there's a lot of residential segregation al- -- it's informal and economic and, um, as a result of that, I think that classism, you know, sort of takes over where racism blends out. [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, ah --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it still creates problems, because people aren't -- are not knowing each other on an equal footing.  
L:  Oh, and when I went to college, I -- I sought it out and I found that, um, [MN] most of the black students really didn't --
