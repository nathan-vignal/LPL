R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  Um, I'm Kim Rowley --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- from Jersey.
L:  Hello, my name is Trudy and I'm calling from North Carolina. [NOISE]
R:  Okay.  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH] I- I'm.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- trying to think about the last movie I saw I can't really remember what it was.
L:  [LAUGH] Well I just saw X. Men Two [LAUGH] last night -- and I didn't --
R:  Oh yeah?
L:  I didn't really think it was as good as the first one was though.
R:  Yeah, I heard a few people that said that -- that they saw it, you know they waited like till one AM to see it when it opened and it wasn't as good as they expected it to be.
L:  Yes.  I still [MN] -- those kind of movies I just don't think you can top [NOISE] two times.  You know -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's like a one time movie.  It's not as [inaudible].
R:  Right -- right.  [LIPSMACK] Um, I'm trying to think what the last movie I saw in the movie theater was.  I think it was -- [SIGH] it might have been Catch Me If You Can and that was with Leonardo di Caprio and Tom Hanks.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yes, I haven't --
R:  But --
L:  -- seen that yet [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  That might have been the -- the f- -- last movie I saw in the theater.  [SIGH] Um, I rent a lot of movies, [MN] uh, we go to Blockbuster a lot and that's usually only with, like, you know my boyfriend and I, I mean the movies, [SIGH] the regular movies you can go with friends, you can go with your boyfriend but when you rent a movie it's usually with like an intimate person. [NOISE]
L:  Right.
R:  And it depends on like the mood I'm in, you know I mean if it's kind of like a rainy night and it's really like a lazy -- you know I feel really lazy -- we'll go to Blockbuster and we'll rent a movie [SIGH].  But, if it's a movie like I really, really, really want to see and it just came out I- I'll make the trip to the theater.
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH] But there's, you know, uh, to me there's disadvantages in going to the theater.  [SIGH] Um, it's certainly a lot more money than you would really expect to pay at a theater, [NOISE] you know, I mean, it -- it just seems to be really pricey, more money than what you, [NOISE] you know, would want to pay f- -- to see a movie. [NOISE]
L:  Right 
R:  And second, it- it's not that comfortable, I mean you sit in there in [SIGH] -- in -- you know, in the chair and, you- you know, if you're thirsty you can't pause the movie you can't -- you know?
L:  Yeah.  I would --
R:  What do you think?
L:  -- agree with you.
R:  [NOISE] [MN]
L:  I think I'd rather rent a movie more [MN] th- than going to the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- theater and seeing a movie because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- at home you can get up and go to the bathroom and stop the movie and eat --
R:  Mhm [MN].
L:  -- eat a snack and stuff.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  How much does a movie cost where you are, for the theater?
R:  [NOISE] [MN] About eight fifty. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, it- it just went up here for seven fifty --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so, I always wondered, yes.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  About a dollar difference.
R:  [NOISE] [MN] Yeah and, you know, once -- and then you kinda maybe add in some popcorn and some food and th- that stuff's really expensive!
L:  [LAUGH] Oh yeah, you can spend forty dollars for two people easily!
R:  [NOISE] Right, exactly, and I don't really think [NOISE] it's worth that, you know --
L:  I don't really --.
R:  -- I really don't think that I -- you know, for the two hours that you're there, and if the movie sucks it's like, you feel like you wasted all this money.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, uh, to rent a video it's probably about three or four dollars.
L:  Right.
R:  So -- if it's bad, you know, y- you didn't put that much money into it. [MN]
L:  Exactly.  I just hate --
R:  I th-
L:  -- people that bring their kids to the adult movies [LAUGH] 'cause then you're --
R:  Oh my god!
L:  -- trying to watch it [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I have a -- I have a small child but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I would never bring them to see like X. Men [LAUGH] not like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- three or four --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- years old, like when we were watching it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- there was two kids crying the whole entire time.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, but the --
R:  Oh my god!
L:  I understand --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the kids in the Disney movies, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's expected.
R:  [MN] Right -- right.  Or you have people that talk or their phone rings in -- in the middle of the movie.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] It's just, I don't know, if it -- I only like to go there if it's like a movie I really, really want to see and I can't wait for it to be out on video or on HBO [SIGH]--
L:  Right.
R:  -- but I'd rather rent a movie, it's just more convenient and it's just better, plus you could go alone, I mean, [SIGH] you -- I mean, you can rent the movie and you could see it yourself.  [SIGH] No one --
L:  Right.
R:  -- really goes --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- alone to the movie theater.
L:  Exactly.  I would -- 
R:  You know. 
L:  -- have never saw X. Men if it wasn't for my husband, he's a comic book freak so -- [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So he's the one that wanted to see it -- it.  like it was his third time watching it last night and my first, you know, so. [LAUGH] [PAUSE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I just hate going to the movies.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, what -- what about the last movie -- when was the last time you rented a movie? [NOISE]
L:  Um, I watched The Ring about two nights ago and I rented that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I hadn't seen that until -- it was -- yeah it was a Wednesday night so it was a few nights ago.
R:  Yeah, [SIGH] um, I think maybe a month ago or so we rented a movie.  I can't -- [MN] hard to think though, you know, the titles, I mean you see so many movies and stuff it's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- hard to think about what, you know, the last thing you rented was.  [SIGH] But we definitely -- you know, we rent movies more than we go out.
L:  Yeah, me too --
R:  That's definitely.
L:  -- 'cause I couldn't tell you what the last movie I saw before X. Men was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- maybe like Lilo and Stitch [COUGH] was the last thing I saw at the movies before that 'cause I just hate going.  [PAUSE] But I rent mov- -- I rent movies every week.
R:  Yeah -- yeah.  W- we used to, you know, w- we -- actually what happened was, we got all these gift certificates, Blockbuster gift certificates.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  And we had about fifty dollars worth [NOISE] so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we just kept using them and using them and renting and renting and when we ran out we kinda like slowed down our frequency of renting.
L:  Right.
R:  You know 'cause now, you know, [MN] we -- we ran -- we ran out of gift certificates, so we haven't really been doing it that much. [PAUSE]  So, uh [LAUGH].  [SIGH] Um, I guess I could talk about the one time we went to the movies to see Erin Brockovich and there was these girls behind us talking.
L:  Ah! [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] I turned around and asked them to shut up and they went and got the theater manager and complained about me.
L:  Oh my god!
R:  And they were the ones that were talking!  You know? [SIGH]
L:  Oh gosh!
R:  And then --
L:  I rem --
R:  You know?
L:  That is crazy. [LAUGH]
R:  And then, uh, when the movie was over they -- they approached me in the hallway of the movie theater and like, you know, started kind of being snobby and rude. [SIGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And they were the ones that were talking, you know.  I mean, sorry if I turn around and that, you know, and say, you know, "Can you please shut your mouth, I'm trying to watch a movie".  So, it's just -- and -- and we actually -- we avoid certain theatres because of a type of people that go there.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, rowdy, maybe younger kids, you know, um ...
L:  That's the -- that's the problem where I live.  I live in a college --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- town. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I'm a little bit -- I'm a little bit older than college age but uh, [SIGH] it's like when you go in there, these -- I still call them teenagers -- are throwing food and stuff.
R:  [MN] Right, right.
L:  I'd just rather stay home.
R:  And they're really loud and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, and so we avoid certain theatres because we just don't want --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to be, you know, around that type of crowd.
L:  Right.
R:  It just ruins it, the whole experience, you know, I mean --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] it's not -- it's just not polite --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and it just makes, you know, everyone else have a bad time when you have people, [SIGH] you know, talking during the movie and --and getting up constantly [NOISE] and phones going off -- how can you enjoy a movie like that?
L:  I don't know [LAUGH].  I don't know.
R:  Yeah.  [PAUSE] Well these ten minutes have gone by really -- really slow [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Usually I'm in a call -- you know, in the middle of a call with someone --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and next thing you know it's over. [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, well this is o- --
R:  This has gone by a little --
L:  -- only the second time I've done this.  This is the second time.
R:  This is only -- this is the third I've done.
L:  Oh, okay.  [MN] Oh, I think it's pretty interesting.  I usually can't talk to people I don't know but I have been able to do this, so. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I'm just worr- -- I'm wondering how do we get paid, exactly.
L:  Uh, yeah, that's a good- big question, I'm like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I've done a lot of mystery shopping jobs, I don't know if you -- 
R:  Yeah, so do I and that's legitimate.
L:  Okay.
R:  I get --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the money and there's no problems and if I -- you know, reimbursed --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and all that.  This --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- I don't know, I've never ...
L:  Yeah, exactly, I mean I did mystery shopping and merchandising and I've only e- ever had one problem getting paid, it took me like six months to get paid.  I finally got paid but it took a while.
R:  Mhm.  What was the company?
L:  Um, it was called Service Sells[?] or something like that.
R:  Oh, I don't know, no.  Oh, Service Sleuths?  S.L. ...
L:  No, no, it's, no it's not the same one, I know what you're talking about.  This is one that's --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- right here in North Carolina.
R:  Oh.  Yeah, no I don't --
L:  It's like a -- a local merchandising -- I did demonstrations in food lines, set up little tables, you know, and gave out samples.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  And that's -- I did something in December like Christmas [SIGH] candy and that- it was like --
R:  [MN] Oh!
L:  -- I just got paid here in May, so. 
R:  Mm.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So you haven't gotten any cheque from -- from the Fisher project at all?
L:  No.  No.
R:  Yeah, no.  Neither- neither have I and -- [SIGH] I mean I only started probably last week.
L:  Uh.
R:  So.
L:  This is um, yeah, me too, yeah this is the second call and I've -- I think it was like May the third or fourth --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when I signed up, so ... [NOISE]
R:  I'd be curious to see, you know, if we ever do get paid.  I mean, [SIGH] I don't know -- [LAUGH] [MN]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It just seems- it seems kind of unreal, ten dollars for each call, you know.
L:  Yes, yeah, yeah.
R:  I mean that's -- that's, [SIGH] I mean, unbelievably good.
L:  Yeah.  So call me every day at least three times --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- a day. [LAUGH]
R:  They call me every day!
L:  Oh, do they?
R:  Yeah! I get a call every day.
L:  Oh! Well I usually -- I -- they have my home number and cell phone number and sometimes I hear on the answer machine at home.  See they called me on my cell phone.  I'm at home but they still called me on my cell phone this time.
R:  Oh!
L:  But I don't know.
R:  [SIGH] You know, I only gave one number -- my cell -- and I always carry it around with me and I get calls every day.
L:  [MN]
R:  [SIGH] And, uh, you know, sometimes I can't talk, 'cause I can't talk but, m- -- you know, for the most part they'll ask three times if I've -- I've been able to talk and that was that. [PAUSE]  I'm wondering how many minutes it's been, it seems like it's been ten minutes, right?
L:  I looked at my cell phone and it was like nine something just a second ago so I don't know.
R:  Okay, so probably almost done.
L:  Yeah.  I was just thinking about going to --
R:  So whereabouts in North Carolina 'cause I've been to Winston, Salem and also the Outer Banks.
L:  Um, [SIGH] I'm in Greenville, the -- um, where East Carolina University is located.
R:  Oh!  No.
L:  It's a --
