R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  My name is Kim.
R:  Hi, my name is Kilston[?]. I live in, ah, Connecticut.
L:  Okay, I'm in Colorado.
R:  Wow, okay. [LAUGH] Nice to talk to you today.
L:  [MN]
R:  Um, I guess we're supposed to talk about movies.  Um, [LIPSMACK] last movie that I saw was, um, Harry Potter two.  I took my kids to see it and, [LIPSMACK] um, we, ah -- re- -- we, ah, bought the DVD for it so now we watch it at home, which is more convenient because my kids don't have the ability to sit quietly for a very long time so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I guess in response to one of the questions, I would say that I would prefer to rent a movie and watch it at home with my family, simply because I think it would be kinder to the, um, patrons, um, at the theatre if my kids aren't sitting there with them.  [LIPSMACK] How 'bout you?
L:  [SIGH] Ah, the same -- the same thing that you ha- -- ah, have said.  I have three small kids and I like to go with my husband, you know, by ourselves, but in -- on occasion we do take our kids and they -- they sit well for being six, three and two, they sit through the whole thing and are fairly quiet, but it's more convenient to be at home with our kids.  And I can't remember the last one that we went to see.  I think it was at -- ah, that one, um, Catch Me If You Can.  
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I think was the last one that we went to see.  My husband and I, we didn't take our kids.  Um, but yes, it's more convenient to stay at home and -- and, ah, rent them here, you know. 
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  'Cause it's easier on the kids.
R:  -- it's also expensive.  It's also more expensive to --
L:  Very true. 
R:  -- take, ah, a whole family to the theatre.  I don't know how much it is in Colorado, but here it's nine dollars and fifty cents for an adult and --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- we try to get the discount tickets if we can, but, ah, generally by the time you've bought the tickets and you've gotten some soda and some popcorn and something sweet, you know, you're out of a lot of money.  [SIGH] So ...
L:  Oh, certainly. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That can be ten dollars a -- a -- a person here for that.  I mean, the -- the tickets are already, like, eight fifty or nine dollars and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and then plus your soda and popcorn, it's ridiculous. 
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, so we --
L:  So, yeah.
R:  -- generally wait for -- for the movies to go to video and DVD, and if you're paying nineteen ninety nine for, you know, a video or DVD it's -- it actually sometimes comes out cheaper than if you took your family to the theatre to beg- -- to begin with, so ...  And then you can watch it over and over, which is what my kids love to do.
L:  Certainly.
R:  They'll watch the same -- [SIGH] the same movie, you know, five times in a row and still not be sick of it, so ...
L:  Oh, for sure.  For sure.
R:  I guess for the most part it's easier for parents just to stay at home.  Although my husband and I, we -- we -- [LIPSMACK] when we get time, when we get, ah, my mom to come over and babysit, it's not to go, you know, we don't go to the movies, we try to do stuff, you know, work in the garden, or do things that we [LAUGH] can't normally do, so ...
L:  That's a good idea, too. 
R:  Yeah, so we, ah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- trying to think, we also just bought Treasure Planet, so I haven't been able to sit down -- that's -- well, you know, that's one problem, if we buy the -- if we buy or rent the movies, I generally don't sit down long enough to watch the whole movie, because I think to myself, "I should start a load of laundry".
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's the --
R:  Or --
L:  -- mom instinct --
R:  -- "I should --"
L:  -- kicking in. [LAUGH]
R:  "-- put -- I should -- I should load the dishwasher" or something, and then I end up, [MN] you know, stepping away from the movie and then I end up missing, you know, a good half of it, so ...  [SIGH] I don't know.  Maybe I oughta get away to the movies [LAUGH] here so I can see it uninterrupted, so ...
L:  That may be good too, but it's that mom instinct that kicks in, you know.
R:  Oh, I know.  I know, it's --
L:  So, yeah, we just went -- rented a couple for the weekend, haven't watched them yet -- or no, the kids watched one, it was, ah, the Joseph King of Dreams or something like that.
R:  Oh, that's --
L:  But they -- they watched --
R:  -- a fun story.
L:  -- that one, but ...
R:  That's a fun story. 
L:  Um, but, yeah, we -- I think we're going to try to go see that Nemo one, um, uh, this week at the movie theatre.
R:  Yeah, my --
L:  It comes out Friday, but my husband will get preview tickets on Thursday so hopefully we will be able to see it then --
R:  Oh, great.
L:  -- before it comes out, but -- so that'll be the next one we see, but we don't take our kids to too many movies, we don't like all of the ones that are out, you know, not very, uh --
R:  Yeah, unless they're Disney -- unless they're Disney ones, you know, the --
L:  And even some of those we don't even let our kids watch, so ...
R:  Really?
L:  'Cause it's not --
R:  Did you -- did you let them see Spy Kids?
L:  Ah, we saw the first one.
R:  Mhm.
L:  The second one looked a little too much for me.  So we --
R:  It's a little --
L:  -- didn't --
R:  -- [inaudible].  Yeah, it's a lot of --
L:  Yeah, it was --
R:  -- action.
L:  Mm, mm.
R:  Well, we're looking --
L:  Too --
R:  -- forward to the, ah, the Spy Kids three, because it's supposed to be three D, um --
L:  Oh, I didn't even know there was a third one coming, wow.
R:  There's one coming out in July. 
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  So, uh, we're hoping to take my son to that one.  He's five, my daughter's three, but we're hoping to get, um, [SIGH] you know, him to the theatre to get the three D effect --
L:  Well --
R:  -- 'cause he's never seen --
L:  -- that would be really --
R:  -- that --
L:  -- neat. 
R:  -- before.  So --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- I think for that we'll spring for the tickets and -- [SIGH] and, ah, try to see -- try to see that.
L:  If more movies came out like that, were three D where you'd have to get the effect to sit in the theatre, more people would be willing, I think, to go, you know.
R:  I think so.  I think so.  Ah, I can't think -- uh, the only other ones where we've -- we've had glasses, I think, were at Disney, um --
L:  Oh, right, mhm.
R:  -- where they have those -- those interactive kind of theatre seats where you -- where you watch and the seats move and there's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, mist in the room, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, we, ah, [SIGH] well, we don't enjoy those kind of outings that much [LAUGH] any more.  We basically just try to stay at home on the weekends and catch up with our -- [SIGH] catch up with our, ah, you know, our chores and things so --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- movies are --
L:  -- certainly.
R:  -- movies are a big luxury for us right now, so ...
L:  Definitely.  And the theatres are getting nicer too.  I've enjoyed the last few times going to the -- those theatres that have the, you know, the love seats, those big seats that come up in the middle, you know, they're nicer ones that are --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- stadium seating, not the --
R:  I haven't --
L:  -- old ones.
R:  -- seen -- [LAUGH] I haven't seen any like that yet [inaudible].
L:  Oh, they're really neat.  They're [MN] -- like maybe I live in a bigger city than -- [LAUGH] than where you are, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they have the stadium seating so it goes up.  It doesn't matter where you sit, you can always see the -- the, ah, screen very well and, you know, the seat in the mi- -- the, ah, rail comes up in the middle for your hands so you can sit next to your husband and not be, like, four arms away, you know.
R:  Oh --
L:  It's really --
R:  -- no, I've never --
L:  -- neat, so  ...
R:  -- I've not been in a theatre --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- [inaudible] a theatre like that, so ...
L:  Yeah, they came here a couple of years ago, so I -- I enjoy those.  It's -- they're getting a lot nicer.
R:  Yeah, we have a --
L:  So ...
R:  -- we have a relatively new theatre close to us.  [MN] I think --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- there's, like, sixteen screens --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- in it, but, ah, it's -- it's not particularly -- it's not particularly fancy.  I mean, it's nicely made but, uh, it's basically there to herd everybody [LAUGH] in and you're pretty --
L:  Oh, certainly, yeah.
R:  -- pretty close, ah, to each other so ... [LIPSMACK] You know, I --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- ah, I don't know that my daughter would be ready yet.  She's three, but she does not have the concentration level that my son does, so I don't think that she is a good movie -- she's not a good movie patron at this time, so maybe in another --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- year or two, she'll be --
L:  Yeah, certain kids are like that.  Um, we -- our kids sit still some -- most of the time they -- they do.  We don't go on a regular basis, but they sit in other things for long periods of time, so they know how to sit still, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah, my son's got good con- -- he's always had -- I've [MN] -- good concentration.  I took him to see Scooby Doo, that animated -- well, it wasn't animated, but it was kind of -- it was sort of a mix, [LAUGH] um, that Scooby Doo movie that was --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- out, I think it was, like, last year, and he --
L:  Yeah, we went to it and left within fifteen minutes, [LAUGH] we left.
R:  It was bizarre.
L:  So ...
R:  It was bizarre.
L:  Yeah, that's exactly why we left.  I thought it was demonic, so we took --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- our kids and got out of there --
R:  I could --
L:  -- fast.
R:  -- yeah, I could definitely -- I could definitely see how, you know --
L:  I mean, I watched[?] Scooby Doo as a kid, but it wasn't like this and we don't agree with all that, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- ghosts and goblins and, you know, s- -- casting spells on people and it was like, "Ah, that's a little too much".
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, we did leave within fifteen minutes of --
R:  It had a -- it had a very weird twist at the end.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It -- it --
L:  It was very strange.
R:  -- it was kind of a silly -- it was kind of silly --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- but what was funny about it, and I grew up watching it, um, was that the real characters acted a lot like the cartoon characters did.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  So that was the only thing that I found amusing about it, but my son just, you know, he sat still through the whole thing and we had a -- we had a good time.  One of our few outings together. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  So ... [LIPSMACK]
L:  That's even a good idea, to take your, [NOISE] you know, like, have a mom and daughter day or a mom and -- and son day, you know, and just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you two go to the theatre.
R:  Yeah, it's --
L:  That may be really good. [NOISE]
R:  That's a particular treat --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to get away --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- with one of them so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, you know, like I said, when we -- when Spy Kids comes --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- out, we'll go to, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we'll go to the theatre to -- to see it in three D.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, 'cause that'll be an --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- unusual effect --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to enjoy, so ...
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] That would be good.
R:  Yeah, so ...  I don't know.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Uh-oh. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] I think his foot just fell asleep and [NOISE] he doesn't know what to do. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  Well [MN] --
R:  -- they're -- they're quiet until the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- phone rings --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, ah, they want to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, get your attention so ...
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Well, hopefully you'll find another movie to enjoy soon enough or rent one. [MN] [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  We'll probably, like I said, we'll probably g- -- this summer, we'll -- we'll go out.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  My, ah, niece is, ah --
L:  [NOISE] [MN]
R:  -- had her birthday this --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- weekend and we decided that we would take her for a day and we'd --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- all go to the movies and have that sort of be --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- her little birthday outing with our family.  So, instead of a crazy -- a big crazy birthday party, she's just gonna kinda spend the day with us and we'll do --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we'll find some movie that she'll enjoy.  Prob- -- maybe that Nemo movie will be fun --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for her to watch.  So ...
L:  Looks cute.  Re- -- you know, animated and -- and kid friendly and [MN] so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we'll see how that goes.
R:  I -- I am -- I'm trying to think of what other kids' movies are -- are out right now, but, ah, I --
L:  I know they had a Piglet one.  The last time we saw a Piglet movie that, ah, was about to come out, I think it came out on April first or something, we wanted to take the kids to that but never did, so ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  That may be something else.  But there's ha- -- co- -- not very few -- or not very many, ah, kid friendly movies out there, [NOISE] or even adult friendly, I think [inaudible] --
R:  No, I --
L:  -- it's very hard --
R:  -- you know, I've never seen --
L:  -- to find a decent [NOISE] movie out.
R:  -- the first Matrix movie --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I have no desire to see the second one either.
L:  [NOISE] That's [LAUGH] how I feel.
R:  I think it's too bizarre.  Yeah, I just --
L:  That's how I feel. [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm not -- and -- and maybe --
L:  [NOISE] [inaudible]
R:  -- that's why my husband and I don't go out bu- -- together to movies that much because he tends to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like the action --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- films and I don't like them. [SIGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I really don't care for them much.  I like comedies better, light hearted, [SIGH] you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- where you sort of get away and -- and you laugh and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you just -- you feel better when you leave the movie theatre, rather than, oh, my gosh, you know.
L:  [NOISE] What did I spend my time watching?  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I guess that's another reason to have it at home, that you can get a variety of what you want and, you know, you could get a comedy.  That's what we usually do.  We'll try to get one cou- co- --
