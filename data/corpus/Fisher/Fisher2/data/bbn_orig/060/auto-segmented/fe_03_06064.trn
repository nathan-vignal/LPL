AND THEN IF YOU HAVE TO HIRE A SITTER [LAUGHTER] YOU HAVE TO HIRE A BABY-SITTER AND THEN THE FOOD IS OUTRAGEOUS  (fe_03_06064-A-0012)

I DON'T KNOW I MEAN I DON'T MIND I THINK IF THERE'S A BIG ONE THAT COMES OUT THAT SUPPOSED TO BE REALLY GREAT WHAT WAS THE MOVIE I SAW  (fe_03_06064-A-0014)
GLADIATOR YEARS AGO YOU KNOW THAT THEY SAID YOU REALLY NEED TO SEE ON THE BIG SCENE BECAUSE OF THE PANORAMIC SHOTS AND ALL THIS STUFF  (fe_03_06064-A-0015)
I DON'T MIND BUT IF IT'S JUST THE STORY YOU'RE FOLLOWING  (fe_03_06064-A-0016)
I WOULD RENT IT AND STAY HOME  (fe_03_06064-A-0017)
IT RIGHT AND YOU CAN SET THE VOLUME AT WHATEVER TEMPERATURE OR WHATEVER HEIGHT YOU WANT AND THE TEMPERATURE I MEAN SOMETIMES I GO TO THE THEATER IN THE SUMMER TIME AND IT'S FREEZING COLD [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06064-A-0019)
IT'S JUST WAY TOO COLD OR YOU DON'T KNOW WHO'S GOING TO BE IN THERE I MEAN I SUPPOSE IT DEPENDS ON WHAT KIND OF MOVIE YOU'RE SEEING BUT  (fe_03_06064-A-0020)
YOU KNOW I JUST IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD ANYWAY YOU GET SOME REALLY ROUGH CROWDS SEEMS LIKE THAT HANG OUT UM I'M IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA  (fe_03_06064-A-0021)
AND IT SEEMS LIKE SOME KIDS A LOT OF KIDS JUST HANG OUT AT THE THEATER  (fe_03_06064-A-0022)
YOU KNOW SO I DON'T  (fe_03_06064-A-0023)
YEAH YEAH SO IT'S NOT I DON'T KNOW  (fe_03_06064-A-0024)
AND LIKE I SAY DEPENDS WELL IT REALLY DEPENDS ON WHAT KIND OF MOVIE YOU'RE SEEING SO WHAT WHAT WAS THE LAST MOVIE YOU SAW  (fe_03_06064-A-0025)
[LAUGHTER] I'M TRYING TO THINK I TOOK MY KIDS TO SEE  (fe_03_06064-A-0026)
THE JONAH MOVIE  (fe_03_06064-A-0027)
UM  (fe_03_06064-A-0028)
YEAH WE SAW SPIRIT OKAY I SAW THAT WITH MY KIDS AND MY MY FIVE SIX YEAR OLD CRIED SAID IT WAS THE SADDEST THING I EVER SAW [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06064-A-0029)
SO MY  (fe_03_06064-A-0030)
YEAH I'M TRYING TO THINK WHAT I KNOW I WENT TO SEE SOMETHING  (fe_03_06064-A-0031)
BEFORE THAT BUT BOY IT DIDN'T MAKE THAT BIGGER OF AN IMPRESSION OF ME DID IT IF  (fe_03_06064-A-0032)
I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME OF IT [LAUGHTER] UM I DON'T KNOW BIG ONES LIKE TITANIC I LIKE TO SEE ACTION MOVIES SOMETIMES IN THE THEATERS  (fe_03_06064-A-0033)
UM  (fe_03_06064-A-0034)
OH THE NEW ONE  (fe_03_06064-A-0035)
NOW SEE THAT MIGHT BE BECAUSE OF THE SPECIAL EFFECTS THAT MIGHT BE THE KIND OF PLACE TO BE IN A THEATER WITH THE SURROUND SOUND AND YOU KNOW THE BIG SCREEN AND EVERYTHING  (fe_03_06064-A-0036)
YEAH BUT YOU NEED TO BE YOU KNOW AND AND YOU CAN SEE IT UNINTERRUPTED AND REALLY GET INTO IT UM I THINK I SAW A DRAMA WAS THE LAST ONE THAT I SAW  (fe_03_06064-A-0037)
I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER THAT'S PRETTY SAD  (fe_03_06064-A-0038)
EXCEPT FOR THE KIDS ONES YOU KNOW THE JONAH BUT THE THING ABOUT TAKING THE KIDS TO THE THEATER THEN AGAIN  (fe_03_06064-A-0039)
IS THEY GET JUST AS EXCITED IF WE RENT A MOVIE AND WE STAY HOME AND POP POPCORN  (fe_03_06064-A-0040)
AS OPPOSED TO GOING OUT AND SPENDING TWENTY DOLLARS JUST ON THE FOOD  (fe_03_06064-A-0041)
[LAUGHTER] FOR THE KIDS  (fe_03_06064-A-0042)
RIGHT RIGHT AND YOU GET UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SHOW AND YEAH NO I MEAN I I I SEE SOMETIMES PREVIEWS AND I THINK OH I THINK I NEED TO I NEED TO SEE THAT AT THE THEATER  (fe_03_06064-A-0043)
YOU KNOW I NEED TO GET OUT AND SEE THAT AT THE THEATER AND THEN AND THEN I THINK WELL I CAN'T WAIT TILL IT COMES OUT ON VIDEO [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06064-A-0044)
SO THAT'S THE NEXT THAT'S THE NEXT STEP BUT I THINK THE FREQUENT RENTER CARDS AT THE VIDEO STORES MAKE IT MORE REASONABLE TO RENT SO AND EVEN OUR LOCAL LIBRARY RENTS MOVIES  (fe_03_06064-A-0045)
OR THEY CHECK 'EM FOR FREE AS LONG AS YOU  (fe_03_06064-A-0046)
KEEP THEM LESS THAN A WEEK [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] THEY'RE CHEAP  (fe_03_06064-A-0047)
SO BUT I DON'T KNOW I JUST I THINK JUST THE SCENE OF THE THEATERS IS NOT  (fe_03_06064-A-0048)
IS NOT VERY  (fe_03_06064-A-0049)
IT'S NOT VERY DESIRABLE FOR ME  (fe_03_06064-A-0050)
TO GO AND HANG OUT  (fe_03_06064-A-0051)

SO THAT THERE VIRTUALLY YOU DON'T HAVE ANYBODY IN FRONT OF YOU SO THAT'S REALLY NICE  (fe_03_06064-A-0055)
WELL THEN THAT DEFINITELY CUTS THE MOVIE VIEWING OUT BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOUR FEET ALTHOUGH THE LAST SHOW WE WENT TO THAT'S RIGHT I I REMEMBER NOW I WENT TO SEE UM LIKE BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING  (fe_03_06064-A-0056)
