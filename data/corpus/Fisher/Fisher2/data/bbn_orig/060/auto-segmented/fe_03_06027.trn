WELL [MN] I GUESS MY EXPERIENCE IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THAT IN AH LIVING IN AND WORKING IN LOS ANGELES FOR MANY YEARS UM  (fe_03_06027-B-0021)
I'VE CERTAINLY SEEN A LOT OF INS AND OUTS OF THE WHOLE SITUATION AND UM I'VE [SIGH] I  (fe_03_06027-B-0022)
GUESS I WOULD SAY THAT AH BOTTOM LINE I'M DEEPLY COMMITED TO THE NOTION OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION  (fe_03_06027-B-0023)
BECAUSE I THINK THAT UM  (fe_03_06027-B-0024)
THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY WAYS IN WHICH MINORITIES HAVE BEEN AH  (fe_03_06027-B-0025)
DEPRIVED OF OPPORTUNITIES TO COME FORWARD TO THE LEVEL OF THEIR ABILITY  (fe_03_06027-B-0026)
AND THAT IN FACT THAT AS WHITES  (fe_03_06027-B-0027)
WE HAVE BENEFITED IN-  (fe_03_06027-B-0028)
INDIRECTLY OR IN SOME CASES VERY DIRECTLY  (fe_03_06027-B-0029)
FROM THE FACT THAT OTHERS HAVEN'T HAD THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE HAVE SO HISTORICALLY I GUESS I SEE IT AS BEING A DEBT THAT NEEDS TO BE PAID  (fe_03_06027-B-0030)
AND THINK THAT THIS IS PROBABLY SOMEWHAT UM  (fe_03_06027-B-0031)
[LIPSMACK] AN UNUSUAL PERSPECTIVE ON IT UM I GUESS I'VE I'VE HAD A LOT OF EXPERIENCE IN THIS AND WITH THIS IN THE PRE- PLACES THAT I'VE WORKED UM  (fe_03_06027-B-0032)
I HAVE DIRECTLY EXPERIENCED UM BEING SORT OF SHUNTED ASIDE IN BECAUSE OPPORTUNITIES WERE BEING  (fe_03_06027-B-0033)
PROVIDED TO MINORITIES PERSONS AND  (fe_03_06027-B-0034)
MY REACTION TO IT WAS WELL IT'S ABOUT TIME [LAUGHTER] THAT THEY'RE  (fe_03_06027-B-0035)
THAT SOME OTHER GROUPS HAD PREFERENCE YOU KNOW PARTICULARLY IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THIS COMMUNITY UM HAS BEEN AH EVER INCREASING IN THE PROPORTION OF AH OTHER ETHNIC GROUPS  (fe_03_06027-B-0036)
SO THAT UM I MEAN IT'S QUITE REMARKABLE TO ME EVEN TODAY HOW IN UPPER PROFESSIONAL LEVELS HOW RELATIVELY FEW MINORITY PERSONS ARE UM REPRESENTED  (fe_03_06027-B-0037)
STARTLING  (fe_03_06027-B-0038)
MHM MHM THIS IS THE TRUTH AND AND I THINK THAT ONE OF THE ASPECTS OF THIS IS THAT  (fe_03_06027-B-0040)
OTHER COUNTRIES CAN'T RECOGNIZE WHAT THE U. S. [LAUGHTER] IS REALLY ABOUT AS LONG AS WE'RE REPRESENTED IN MAJOR POSITIONS AH ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY BY WHITES  (fe_03_06027-B-0041)
YEAH  (fe_03_06027-B-0042)
MHM  (fe_03_06027-B-0043)
MHM MHM YEAH I- IT IS QUITE REMARKABLE ISN'T IT [LAUGHTER] I REMEMBER  (fe_03_06027-B-0044)
SPEAKING TO THE PRESIDENT OF MY ORGANIZATION AT ONE TIME AND THE SUBJECT OF HAVING WOMEN REPRESENTED HAD COME UP SO HE ASKED ME WELL WHAT PROPORTION OF WOMEN DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD HAVE ON OUR BOARD  (fe_03_06027-B-0045)
SO I SAID WELL AH HOW ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT [LAUGHTER] AND HE GAVE ME THIS [LAUGHTER] YOU'VE GOT TO BE NUTS LOOK [LAUGHTER] IT'S REMARKABLE  (fe_03_06027-B-0046)
YEAH SO BUT IT'S NOT SO EASY TO ACHIEVE IN MANY WAYS UM  (fe_03_06027-B-0047)
THE  (fe_03_06027-B-0048)
MHM  (fe_03_06027-B-0049)
MHM MHM MHM WELL THERE IS THIS VERY INTERESTING ARTICLE I READ A LONG TIME AGO  (fe_03_06027-B-0050)
BY JAMES BALDWIN IN WHICH HE SPOKE ABOUT  (fe_03_06027-B-0051)
UM THE PROGRESSION OF VARIOUS EUROPEAN ETHNICS IN THE UNITED STATES AND HOW ALL THESE GROUPS  (fe_03_06027-B-0052)
UM SORT OF MELTED TOGETHER AND BECAME WHITE AND FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE FACT THAT FOR GENERATIONS THEY'VE BEEN AT EACH OTHERS THROATS IN THE OLD COUNTRY BUT SOMEHOW HERE THEY WERE ALL  (fe_03_06027-B-0053)
ONE BIG HAPPY FAMILY AS OPPOSED TO EVERYBODY ELSE  (fe_03_06027-B-0054)
YEAH THEY WERE THE ONES WHO MELTED BUT  (fe_03_06027-B-0055)
UM IT DIDN'T HAPPEN ACROSS THE BOARD MHM  (fe_03_06027-B-0056)
WELL IT'S IT'S A HARD  (fe_03_06027-B-0058)
UM ENTRY LEVEL WORK THAT UM BASICALLY NOBODY REALLY WANTS TO DO  (fe_03_06027-B-0059)
AND AH IT'S IT'S A VERY INTERESTING SITUATION HERE IN LOS ANGELES THAT LATINOS ARE NOW FORTY FOUR PERCENT OF THE POPULATION OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY  (fe_03_06027-B-0060)
AND AH IN SOME SITUATIONS YOU CAN YOU KNOW COUNT THE NUMBER IN UPPER LEVELS ON ONE OR TWO FINGERS  (fe_03_06027-B-0061)
SO IT'S IT  (fe_03_06027-B-0062)
WELL PARTLY WHEN IT COMES TO HISPANICS IT'S EASIER TO EXPLAIN BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT SO MANY ARE VER- RELATIVELY RECENT IMMIGRANTS  (fe_03_06027-B-0063)
WHEN IT COMES TO AFRICAN AMERICANS IT'S AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SITUATION BECAUSE IN MOST CASES HISTORICALLY THEY'VE BEEN HERE LONGER THAN ALMOST ANY OF THE WHITE ETHNIC GROUPS  (fe_03_06027-B-0064)
UM BUT SO TOTALLY SHOT OUT OF OPPORTUNITIES UNTIL QUITE RECENT TIME YOU KNOW IT'S  (fe_03_06027-B-0065)
IT AND  (fe_03_06027-B-0066)
MHM  (fe_03_06027-B-0067)

MHM  (fe_03_06027-B-0069)
OH YEAH YEAH IT'S IT'S OUT OF THE QUESTION YEAH LANGUAGE IS A  (fe_03_06027-B-0070)
A HUGE FACTOR IN THE WHOLE THING YOU KNOW MY  (fe_03_06027-B-0071)
APPROACH IS THAT IN IN OUR AREA IN CALIFORNIA I THINK THAT THEY SHOULD BE REQUIRING BILINGUAL EDUCATION FROM THE POINT OF VIEW THAT EVERYBODY WOULD LEARN SPANISH AND ENGLISH  (fe_03_06027-B-0072)
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A HUGE ECONOMIC ASSET  (fe_03_06027-B-0073)
TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WELL WITH OUR NEAREST NEIGHBORS IN SOUTH AMERICA [LAUGHTER] OH GOSH SO IT'S  (fe_03_06027-B-0074)
YEAH YEAH RIGHT  (fe_03_06027-B-0075)
YEP SO IT'S A IT'S AN INTERESTING SITUATION WE WE STILL EXPERIENCE UM  (fe_03_06027-B-0076)
YOU KNOW DESPITE THE FACT THAT THERE'S SO MUCH MIXING AND MINGLING THERE'S A LOT OF RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION AL- IT'S INFORMAL AND ECONOMIC  (fe_03_06027-B-0077)
AND UM  (fe_03_06027-B-0078)
AS A RESULT OF THAT I THINK THAT CLASSISM YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06027-B-0079)
SORT OF TAKES OVER WHERE RACISM BLENDS OUT [LAUGHTER] AND AH IT STILL CREATES PROBLEMS BECAUSE PEOPLE AREN'T ARE NOT KNOWING EACH OTHER ON AN EQUAL FOOTING  (fe_03_06027-B-0080)
