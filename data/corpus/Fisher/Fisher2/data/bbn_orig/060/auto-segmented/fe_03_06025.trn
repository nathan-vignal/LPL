YES I'M SANDRA AH COOPER AND I'M FROM SANTA BARBARA CALIFORNIA  (fe_03_06025-A-0001)
OH AH ANOTHER CALIFORNIAN  (fe_03_06025-A-0002)
WELL THE AH THAT TOPIC IN CALIFORNIA IS A BIG TOPIC [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] VERY BIG TOPIC  (fe_03_06025-A-0003)
I THINK AH I THINK THAT THE UM  (fe_03_06025-A-0004)
POLITICIAN THAT HAS COME OUT AGAINST AFFIRMATIVE ACTION HAS SOME VERY VALID POINTS  (fe_03_06025-A-0005)
I UM  (fe_03_06025-A-0006)
I I THINK THAT AT A TIME IT WAS VERY VALUABLE BUT MY FEELING ABOUT IT NOW IS I KIND OF AGREE WITH HIM THAT AT BASICALLY EVERYONE JUST WANTS A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD  (fe_03_06025-A-0007)
AND HIS FEELING IS THAT BY  (fe_03_06025-A-0008)
GIVING PREFERENCE TO MINORITIES LIKE HIMSELF  (fe_03_06025-A-0009)
WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS THAT THEY CANNOT DO AS WELL  (fe_03_06025-A-0010)
AS A CAUCASIAN  (fe_03_06025-A-0011)
AND HE SAID THAT THAT IS INSULTING  (fe_03_06025-A-0012)
AND UM SO HE DOES NOT UM SEE THE VALUE OF IT AND IT WAS AH  (fe_03_06025-A-0013)
I I THINK [COUGH] MY E- IT KIND OF CRYSTALLIZED MY THINKING ABOUT AFFIRMATIVE ACTION  (fe_03_06025-A-0014)
THAT IT SERVED A PURPOSE AND AH AH I BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS A TIME WHEN IT WAS NECESSARY BUT MY OWN PERSONAL FEELINGS IS THAT IT IS NO LONGER  (fe_03_06025-A-0015)
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AND DO YOU SEE A VALUE OF IT IN THE AH WORK PLACE  (fe_03_06025-A-0016)
IT'S STRICTLY WORK PLACE I KNOW YOU KNOW THE HIGHER EDUCATION THING IS A REAL HOT TOPIC RIGHT NOW BUT IT'S IN THE WORK PLACE IS WHAT  (fe_03_06025-A-0017)
YES  (fe_03_06025-A-0018)
AND AND SO YOU KNOW ON TESTS OR UM ON JOB INTERVIEWS THEY'RE AUTOMATICALLY GIVEN TWENTY FIVE POINTS OR FIFTY POINTS  (fe_03_06025-A-0019)
YOU KNOW I MEAN IT AH AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IS JUST BY VIRTUE OF AH BEING A MINORITY THEY ARE AH  (fe_03_06025-A-0020)
AH GIVEN EXTRA POINTS AND THEN FOR HIRING AND PROMOTING AND WHATEVER  (fe_03_06025-A-0021)
AH THE COMPANY IS ALSO RECOGNIZED FOR AH  (fe_03_06025-A-0022)
BEING AH VERY PROGRESSIVE IN THEIR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION  (fe_03_06025-A-0023)
SO THAT'S WHAT THEY DO IN BUSINESS WITH IT IN SCHOOL IT'S DIFFERENT  (fe_03_06025-A-0024)
YEAH IT'S DIFFERENT AND BUT YOU KNOW IT'S KIND OF INTERESTING I MEAN IF YOU'RE GIVEN THAT KIND OF PREFERENCE IN SCHOOL  (fe_03_06025-A-0025)
FOR THEM IT'S PROBABLY DIFFICULT TO GO INTO THE WORK PLACE AND NOT BE AFFORDED THE SAME THING BUT THIS MAN  (fe_03_06025-A-0026)
YOU KNOW THAT'S SPEAKING I WISH I COULD REMEMBER HIS NAME SAID THAT  (fe_03_06025-A-0027)
THAT'S BELITTLING TO THEM HE SAID YOU KNOW WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT HE SAID  (fe_03_06025-A-0028)
THAT'S THAT'S NOT RIGHT HE SAID IT'S AH IT'S YOU'RE EXPECTING LESS OF THEM  (fe_03_06025-A-0029)
AND AND THAT'S NOT RIGHT SO  (fe_03_06025-A-0030)
I DON'T KNOW  (fe_03_06025-A-0031)
I WAS THAT WAY I WAS THAT WAY I WAS VERY  (fe_03_06025-A-0033)
VERY AMBIVALENT ABOUT IT UNTIL I REALLY STARTED READING HIS THINGS AND THEY'VE HAD SOME THINGS IN THE EDITORIAL SECTION HERE THAT IN SANTA BARBARA THAT HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD THAT HE'S [SIGH] UM  (fe_03_06025-A-0034)
HE SAID IT'S WELL MEANING BUT HE SAID IT HA- IT'S OVER THAT THAT THEY NOW HAVE THE ADVANTAGES WITHIN SCHOOL IF THEY WANT TO HAVE HIGHER EDUCATION THEY HAVE IT  (fe_03_06025-A-0035)
YOU KNOW HE SAID YOU CANNOT THINK THE W- THAT IT'S THE SEVENTIES IT ISN'T THE SEVENTIES ANY MORE  (fe_03_06025-A-0036)
TWO THOUSAND AND THREE NOW AND WE'RE IN A GLOBAL COMMUNITY HE SAID YOU KNOW IT'S DIFFERENT  (fe_03_06025-A-0037)
IT IS DIFFERENT  (fe_03_06025-A-0038)
YES  (fe_03_06025-A-0039)
YES AND AND A A QUESTION THAT WE COULD ASK BACK OF THEM IN THE COM- THE COMMENTS IS [COUGH] AFFIRMATIVE ACTION FOR WHAT YOU KNOW YOU COULD SAY THE SAME THING FOR WOMEN  (fe_03_06025-A-0040)
YOU KNOW WOMEN UM AH IF A COMPANY HAS AFFIRMATIVE ACTION FOR THEM AND THE JOB INTERVIEW IS BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN  (fe_03_06025-A-0041)
AND THEY AUTOMATICALLY GIVE THE WOMAN FIFTY POINTS BECAUSE SHE HASN'T BEEN PROMOTED AND SHE HASN'T BEEN GIVEN THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES  (fe_03_06025-A-0042)
YOU KNOW IT'S THE SAME THING SO  (fe_03_06025-A-0043)
IT IS THE SAME THING BECAUSE YOU'RE ACCORDING THEM AN EXTRA BOOST  (fe_03_06025-A-0044)
BY VIRTUE OF WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THEM  (fe_03_06025-A-0045)
THEY HAVEN'T HAD THE SAME ADVANTAGE  (fe_03_06025-A-0046)
THE LAST TOPIC THAT WE HAD WAS AH HOW [MN] YOU MAY HAVE LIKED IT BETTER I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE I'VE DONE TWO OF THIS IS MY THIRD ONE  (fe_03_06025-A-0047)
OH DID YOU  (fe_03_06025-A-0048)
AND THE FIRST TOPIC WAS HOW MUCH MONEY WOULD IT T- WELL THE QUESTION WAS FOR A MILLION DOLLARS WOULD YOU LEAVE THE UNITED STATES NEVER TO RETURN  (fe_03_06025-A-0049)
AND SO AH I ANOTHER CALIFORNIA CALLER WE SAID IN OUR STATE REALLY A MILLION DOLLARS [LAUGHTER] ISN'T THAT MUCH MONEY ANY MORE  (fe_03_06025-A-0050)
IT REALLY ISN'T SO  (fe_03_06025-A-0052)
YES YES AND SO  (fe_03_06025-A-0053)
BUT WE COULD TALK ON THAT YOU KNOW TEN MINUTES EASILY THIS TOPIC IS YOU KNOW IT'S DIFFICULT FOR ME  (fe_03_06025-A-0054)
YES BECAUSE IT'S POLITICALLY CHARGED  (fe_03_06025-A-0056)
IT'S VERY POLITICALLY CHARGED  (fe_03_06025-A-0057)
YES  (fe_03_06025-A-0058)
THAT'S RIGHT IT'S VERY VERY POLITICAL AND IT'S VERY AH  (fe_03_06025-A-0059)
[SIGH] YOU KNOW YOU WANNA BE POLITICALLY CORRECT BUT AS I SAID THIS ONE MAN'S WRITINGS HAVE HE SAID THAT  (fe_03_06025-A-0060)
YOU KNOW LET'S BE HONEST HERE IT IT WAS GREAT IN THE SEVENTIES IT GOT EVERYBODY INTO SCHOOL IT GOT 'EM UP ON THE JOB INTO MANAGEMENT AND WHATEVER BUT THAT'S OVER HE SAYS NOW WE'RE DEALING TWO THOUSAND AND THREE  (fe_03_06025-A-0061)
AND HE SAID EVERYONE DESERVES A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD HE SAID THERE'S NO WAY THAT I WANNA GO INTO A JOB  (fe_03_06025-A-0062)
AND BECAUSE OF MY ETHNICITY I'M GIVEN FIF- FIFTY POINTS  (fe_03_06025-A-0063)
THAT MAKES ME GET A PROMOTION OVER MY CAUCASIAN BROTHER JUST BECAUSE HE SAID I'M BLACK THAT IS ONLY REASON IT IS NOT BASED ON ANY  (fe_03_06025-A-0064)
MERIT IT ISN'T BASED ON MY EDUCATION  (fe_03_06025-A-0065)
MY JOB NOTHING  (fe_03_06025-A-0066)
IT'S BASED ON ONE THING AND THAT'S MY ETHNICITY AND HE SAYS  (fe_03_06025-A-0067)
HE DOESN'T HE SAID NO AND HE SAYS YOU KNOW WHAT IT LEADS TO IS HE SAYS YOU KNOW HOW DOES THAT MAKE THE CAUCASIAN FEEL  (fe_03_06025-A-0068)
HE SAID YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE NOT WANTING TO PROMOTE RACISM BUT HE SAYS IF YOU DO THAT  (fe_03_06025-A-0069)
YEAH HE SAID LET'S GET REAL HERE  (fe_03_06025-A-0070)
SO HE SAID YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE FUELING IT BY DOING THAT AND WHAT YOU'RE TELLING THE AH  (fe_03_06025-A-0071)
AH THE AFRICAN AMERICAN IS THAT HE CANNOT COMPETE WITH ME HE CANNOT COMPETE WITH A CAUCASIAN WITHOUT AN ADVANTAGE  (fe_03_06025-A-0072)
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT IS SAYING AND HE SAYS SO IT BELITTLES HIM  (fe_03_06025-A-0073)
AND IT MAKES THE OTHER PERSON IN THE WORK PLACE ANGRY BECAUSE HE CAN'T BEAT THE FACT THAT HE IS NOT AN AFRICAN AMERICAN  (fe_03_06025-A-0074)
SO IT MAKES THEM ANGRY AND THAT YOU KNOW I'VE SEEN THAT IN FIRE DEPARTMENTS WHO'S VERY MUCH WITH THAT AH THERE'S FIRE DEPARTMENT POLICE  (fe_03_06025-A-0075)
[SIGH] AND UM THEY DO A LOT OF RECRUITING WHERE THEY'RE TRYING TO GET MORE MINORITIES I MEAN IT WO- GOES BACK TO THE AH QUOTA SYSTEM  (fe_03_06025-A-0076)
WHERE YOU'RE EXPECTED TO HAVE SO MANY  (fe_03_06025-A-0077)
AND SO MANY IN MANAGEMENT WELL THEN WHAT THEY ARE SAYING IS THAT IN ORDER TO GET THEM INTO MANAGEMENT YOU HAVE TO GIVE THEM THIS EXTRA BOOST  (fe_03_06025-A-0078)
[COUGH] SO WHEN THEY ASKED THIS THING TONIGHT TO ME IT WAS IT WAS BETTER FOR ME BECAUSE IT ISN'T ABOUT SCHOOL IT IT WAS BETTER IT WAS STRICTLY IN THE WORK PLACE  (fe_03_06025-A-0080)
AND AH [SIGH]  (fe_03_06025-A-0081)
