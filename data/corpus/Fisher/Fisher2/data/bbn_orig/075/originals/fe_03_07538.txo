L:  [NOISE] Hello.
R:  Ah, hi.  Ah, Susanna speaking from Texas.
L:  I'm sorry, what's your name?
R:  Ah, Susanna.
L:  Susanna?
R:  Yes.
L:  I'm Shelley and I am from Ohio.
R:  From Ohio?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, well, what do you think about what the US can do -- what did they say?  [MN]
R:  Ah, to prevent bioterrorists?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah --
L:  Do you --
R:  -- I think --
L:  -- have any ideas on that?
R:  -- it would have a very clever, mm, foreign policy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I think, m- mainly.
L:  I think --
R:  Um ...
L:  I think actually they're going pretty good now but, you know, they try to assess all the dangers that there are and, you know, take care of what they think is a possibility before it happens --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, you know, they're trying to stockpile, I just, I mean, I think it's just monitoring and keeping up the awareness as opposed to, you know, just, y- you know, letting things slack off as the years go on or whatever so it can happen again.
R:  Mhm.  But do you think there's a real chance of, you know, being attacked, ah, and, ah, by -- by some biological weapons?
L:  By some -- by what?
R:  I -- I -- I wonder if you think that there's a real chance that the US would be attacked by, you know, bio weapons, biological weapons?
L:  Um, I think -- I think there's a possibility.  I think if they don't keep up on, [NOISE] you know, what they, you know, monitoring things and being very aware, I think that, they're -- you know, right when they start to look away and let things slack off is when, you know, they're gonna, you know, take that opportunity to do something.  What do you feel?  Do you think there's --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- a chance?
R:  You know, [MN] I was k- -- at the beginning I was kind of thinking that it's a real danger but I think it is kind of hard to get it from abroad, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like, ah, because of the -- the -- the protection system, the defense system that the US has at this point, like the -- the missile, how do you call that missile that -- that are, you know, +shooting down the -- the Iraqis?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And in -- in the co- -- in the -- in the US I don't see a way of producing, like, you know, some terrorists would start introducing in the -- in the country anti US, um, some biological weapons [MN] so, I don't feel that it's a real, real fear [MN] --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  -- at this point.
L:  Right.  I, [MN], you know, I don't -- I -- I think that they should have [several inaudible words] sorry, we're at the mall.  [MN]
R:  I hear you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- really badly. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Ah, hello.
L:  Yeah, I'm still here.  I'm sorry, I'm at the mall.
R:  Yeah, I hear you very badly.  There is [several inaudible words]. 
L:  They always seem to call at the wrong -- the wrong time [LAUGH] --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- always. [MN]
R:  We have some background noise that makes your voice [MN] really difficult to understand for me.
L:  Really?  I'm sorry --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- about that.  Can you hear me better now?
R:  Ah, a little bit.
L:  Okay, well, we're walking out.  We're heading out now.  They just always seem to call me whenever I'm somewhere.
R:  Ahah. 
L:  They -- they never call me, you know, when I'm not doing anything.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN] So, I don't -- I think that, you know, with, um, things such as, you know, water plants and stuff like that, I think it leaves it open to, you know, the bioterrorism --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- possibilities if they continue to, you know, monitor not allowing planes to fly over and staying aware, I think, that, you know, there's a good chance that, [MN] you know, that won't happen but I also -- I really think that George Bush just came up with that excuse to start a war.  I mean, I really don't think that there was a big bioterrorism threat to begin with.  I think it was something he decided he could use an -- as an excuse to get the c- -- ah, country's approval and then go ahead and -- and start a war.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ... I think a lot of it was hyped up because of the war.
R:  Yeah.  Ah, and it appears[?] that they -- they haven't found anything out of today in New York really, so, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I think that the, you know, the report that they get before the war said that there is nothing really --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that there was no proof of having anything so ...
L:  Right.  Well, that's just like, um, [LIPSMACK] when the war had just started and, you know, it was almost every day that they said, "Well, we found something, we found something", and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, nothing was ever found, even though they kept saying that they did and I really believe that that was just, you know, his way of starting a war over, you know, his own personal whatever, vendetta, he had against Saddam --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, I mean, he was just so strongly, you know, for the war and so, you know, made it out that there were all these chemical -- chemicals and everyone else was saying, "No, we can't find any", and, you know, they still haven't found any and yet they're still fighting a war.
R:  Yeah, this is the point that, you know, that stuff, really, I think that really endangered the stability in the wor- -- in the world and [MN] it just made a fear in -- in each nation at this point, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- who is going to be next and, ah --
L:  Right, and --
R:  -- I do not think that, you know, feeding people that you know, bioterrorist is an issue --
L:  Right.
R:  -- will help anybody in the world.
L:  Right, because, well, I mean Saddam's a sick man but at the same time why would you want to do that to your own country?  These are the people who were, you know, you know, believed in him, y- you know, [NOISE] were, you know, worshipping him or whatever --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he's, you know, I highly doubt that he would have done it to his own country.  You know, these are people that he has to live around and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, that he has to deal with.
R:  Ah, like --
L:  So ...
R:  -- you are talking -- saying that Bush would never do it to -- to his own people, yeah?
L:  Right.
R:  [MN] Ahah.  Yeah, you know, [MN] but it was a much different political system than -- than Saddam --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and I do not want to protect him because I think he's a terrible man but I just do not think that, you know, feeding -- feeding the public opinion with -- with all these weapons is a -- is a good -- good step.  
L:  Yeah, [NOISE] I think he's a -- I think that Bush just [NOISE] happened to take the opportunity of what happened with [NOISE] --
R:  Oh, wh- wh- what's that noise?
L:  [NOISE] Sorry ... um, took the opportunity of nine eleven and, you know, went with it, you know, for something that he had, you know, his own vendetta and I think it also had to do with the fact that, you know, when Bill Clinton was in office there was no war but, yet, when, ah, George W Bush's father was in the office he had to have a war.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I think that he just, you know, it was in the family.  I think they wanted to be known for something and I think that that is the excuse that he used that they had, you know, the biochemical whatever all that, [MN] you know, stuff and that was his excuse to start a war.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I really don't believe there was that big of a threat to begin with.  Maybe a small one because, you know, they did have the anthrax that went around a little bit --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but who's to say that that wasn't the President that, you know, snuck some through somewhere --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just to, you know, try to get the public, you know, scared about it.
R:  [MN]
L:  Or it could have just been, you know, people heard about it and decided, oh, well, you know, you know, sick people, well, oh, there's anthrax and, you know, they wanted to start it and it was all just so much of, I guess you could say copycatting --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like, they [COUGH] ... so ...
R:  So, it is [MN] -- it is kind of complicated because always I feel like I'm not quite clear on this September eleven thing, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- how much the government really knew before it happened --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because, you know, there were some opinions that it was well known and -- and there were some signs that something is going to happen --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, um, I am -- I am kind of afraid to think but sometimes I think that somebody maybe just didn't make the step to prevent that could be done --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, ah, such a thing could, you know, because what happened then was really bad and it really ruined the world's stability but answering by, you know, starting the war against Iraq is not -- not the answer and -- and feeding that, you know, now we have danger all over.
L:  Right, no, and, you know, all the -- the countries that opposed, you know, there's a reason that they opposed.  You know, it was a lot off their back to go against the United States and say, you know, such as France, and say, "We're not gonna be a part of this" --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, through NATO and whatever.  There is a reason that those countries did that and I really feel that there wasn't that, you know, the biochemical warfare that they -- and they knew that.  You know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they had the inspectors over there and their inspectors weren't finding anything either.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, it was all just a bunch of, maybe this is a big po- -- you know, a possibility somewhere down the road but for right now we can't find anything.
R:  Yeah.  So, would he agree or not agree?  I am not quite clear at this point.  Ah ...
L:  I ... hm.  I -- I don't think that there is a big chance --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I feel that if, at this point in time, if they were to let down on the, you know, the security that they have in --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in certain places, like, I said, the -- you know, water, um, [LIPSMACK] water plants and, you know, dams and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- stuff like that and don't pay attention I think that there's a possibility that someone --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, has been given the ideas.  You know, someone easily could have put ideas into their head --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- by all the stuff that they talked about.  I mean, I -- there's so many things that I heard on the news that I never would have thought of until they said on the news.
R:  Ahah.
L:  You know, well, such and such could have happened and, or, they could do this or they could do that and [COUGH] ah ...
R:  Yeah, I -- I was kind of discussing that thing but, you know, somebody brought into my attention that it is really difficult to p- -- ah --
