L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.  This is Pat.
R:  Hi.  This is Shaun.  How are you Pat?
L:  I'm okay Shaun.  How are you?
R:  Good.  What part of the country are you calling from?
L:  I'm in Virginia.  Where are you?
R:  I'm in DC.
L:  Oh, we're neighbors.
R:  There you go.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, ah, bioterrorism.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What do you think?
L:  What do I think?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, [SIGH] [LAUGH] what do I think of it or what do I think that we can do to prevent it?
R:  What do you think we can do to prevent it?
L:  [SIGH] You know, I wish I knew. [LAUGH] That's basically it.  It's, um -- it's a very, [NOISE] [PAUSE] hm, how do I wanna put -- obviously, a very dangerous thing and -- and I think that, um, [LIPSMACK] awareness is probably the biggest thing.
R:  A- awareness?  Awareness of what?
L:  Well, knowing the things to be on the lookout for.
R:  W- -- 
L:  I'm -- honestly, I'm not sure if we can really --
R:  What kind of things do you think we should look out for?
L:  I don't know.  I don't know. [NOISE] Why don't you tell me how you feel about it?
R:  [LAUGH] I don't think there's really much we can do about it. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  That's -- that's what I mean.  It's, um -- I think that we need to know that [PAUSE] it's a definite possibility and what to do the event a -- in the event of.  But how can we prevent it?
R:  I -- I think it's just one of those things.  It's gonna happen if it happens and ... [PAUSE] Um, I'm not running out to buy duct tape. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, no. [LAUGH] I'm just living my life as -- as I live my life and not living in fear.
R:  What about going to other countries and ...
L:  I'm not -- I went to the UK last summer.  I'm not interested in going out of the US right now.
R:  No?
L:  Nope
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [PAUSE] Are you?
R:  Yeah.  Actually I am. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm not -- I'm not so afraid of it.
L:  [MN]
R:  What do -- do you think -- w- w- -- I mean, what do you think about, ah, going to other countries and s- sending some, kind of, a message as a way to end it here?  Sort of, a preventative?
L:  Elaborate on that a little bit. [PAUSE] I'm not quite sure, ah --
R:  The -- the root of it, which is the hate not the actual --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- biological agents.
L:  Do you think we can? [NOISE]
R:  I think we can.  I think we can with certain segments of the population.
L:  Yeah. Um, there's some that will never [NOISE] -- never believe that we're anything but vile people.
R:  I agree.  I agree.
L:  So, um --
R:  Um, it's, ah -- it's ingrained in some people's histories.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  No matter where they are and who they're with.
L:  That's right.  Um ... [PAUSE] [NOISE] I don't know. [LAUGH] 
R:  But, [SIGH] um ... [PAUSE] I don't know.  I hear about them, ah, trying things out like, I read -- I recently read a book where they talked about how after nine eleven they secretly put a bunch of sensors around the Washington DC area --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- something like fifty of 'em.
L:  They have testers?
R:  Which were -- were -- which were meant to detect, ah, nuclear signatures --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of different radioactive elements so in the event of a, you know, nuclear bomb they could -- or, you know, that, kind of, material -- if there's some material entering the city limits, they could detect it without, you know, having to stop a large truck.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, on Constitution Avenue.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  But they found so much background radiation that the sensors were totally useless.
L:  Oh, for heaven's sake.  I didn't know. [NOISE] I hadn't heard about that.  Hm.  So, it stands to reason because there's a lot of radiation just in [SIGH] -- I don't want to say in life but it is.  I mean, we have --
R:  Microwaves and cellphones and --
L:  Yeah.  And I have a friend who had a, um -- had a goiter on her thyroid and they had to radiate it.
R:  Mm.
L:  And they were -- she was told to stay away from pregnant women and children and, you know, a lot of things for forty eight hours 'cause she was radioactive.
R:  There you go.
L:  So, we use them in ... [SIGH]
R:  That kind of thing with detection -- actually, Washington is another place -- I -- I read another article about how we're a pilot city where we have, something like, five thousand sensors to detect the minute changes in wind shift --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- around the DC metropolitan area.
L:  So, the --
R:  So, that in the event of what they call a dirty bomb --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they would know where -- potentially, where the wind would push the radioactivity and they could, potentially, alert certain citizens to move away from their neighborhoods or areas.
L:  Well, now that makes sense.  That sounds, ah, quite reasonable to me.
R:  That's all, kind of, stuff after the fact.
L:  Of course.  I mean well, [COUGH] we were so -- do I want to say jaded, blase or ...?  You know, we thought we were indestructible.  Nobody would ever dare do anything to us.  And, um, we found out quite differently.
R:  I, kinda, knew a little better.
L:  Yeah.  Um, [PAUSE] I think -- I think if we really thought about it we might but on the whole, the US just always felt it was totally invincible.  Its people, its borders, its boundaries, everything.
R:  It's -- before it was our massive oceans that provided us with safety.  But, ah --
L:  Well, not only --
R:  -- now it's our open society, kinda, working against us in a way.
L:  Yeah.  Ah, I was gonna say not only our massive oceans but our -- we've always been the -- the one that came out on top on everything.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And everybody just thought the US was the most powerful country in the world and the safest and nobody would dare attempt to touch us.
R:  Hm.
L:  And we were definitely wrong. [LAUGH] [PAUSE] 
R:  I --
L:  Very definitely wrong.  So, um, you, kind of, feel the same way I do that there's really not much we can do about it.
R:  Nothing.  I don't see the point in worrying about it.
L:  Oh, no.  N- -- like you say, I'm not going out and br- -- buy duct tape.
R:  Right.
L:  I'm certainly not gonna stop living.  I'm cautious.
R:  When people talked about how, um, you know, our country could, you know, maybe help some of these other countries out of debt more.  That's what all the -- kinda, the anti globalization movements were.  But, um, [PAUSE] I -- I'm not sure that most people can really relate with the macro economic theories they're talking about.  I don't even think the people who demonstrated really understood them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  If you know what I mean?
L:  That's usually the way. [PAUSE] Definitely.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.  I'm not really sure but -- I don't know.  I see the rich growing richer and the poor growing poorer and I know that's gotta contribute to it somehow.
L:  Well, that's the way it's always been I'm afraid.  And, ah, [SIGH] I don't know.  I don't know.  The way our society is, a lot of the poor think that the world owes them a living and not gonna do anything to try to get -- drag themselves up by the bootstraps and improve.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] M- -- now, that's -- that's too general but [NOISE] a lot of people feel that way.
R:  Hm.
L:  [NOISE] [PAUSE] So, um, that's a little off the subject though I guess. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, what other -- what else could we do to prevent bioterrorism?
L:  [NOISE] Well, [NOISE] [PAUSE] I don't know. [NOISE] I -- I just -- I think that, ah, [SIGH] [PAUSE] we just have to be watchful, we have to make -- to try to, um, [PAUSE] oh, what's the word I'm looking for? [PAUSE] Keep an eye on what people try to bring in the country.  Somebody could bring in a very small vial that would be enough -- with the right substance in it it'd be enough to contaminate a humongous area.
R:  That's what I heard.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So --
R:  How can we control that?
L:  I don't know.  I mean, all sorts of searches and sensors and it just -- somebody could pack it in a [NOISE] -- I don't know.  Pack it like they would, ah, [NOISE] cough syrup or something. [NOISE] I mean, I -- I've heard so much about the fact that, um, [PAUSE] with -- I h- -- I can't remember where I read it now.  I read something about how the quantity of -- and I can't even think of the names of -- of some of the substances.  But just very, very small quantities would wipe out an entire area.  I -- I can't imagine how we could prevent it.  It's -- it's very, very scary. [LAUGH] [PAUSE] But, um, I don't know. I'm not sure anybody does.
R:  [SIGH] What's that?
L:  I s- -- I don't know and I'm not sure anybody really knows.
R:  Yeah.  I think it's gonna be our great fight, you know?
L:  Yep.
R:  I guess people -- generations before us had different enemies.  But, ah, these people don't stay in any one place or call themselves any one name.  They, kinda, act like cowards and --
L:  Y- -- that's -- that's it.  They --
