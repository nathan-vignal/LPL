L:  Hi, this is Kelly.
R:  Hi.  This is Barbara.
L:  This topic, I don't know where to start with this one.
R:  I know.  [LAUGH].  Well, yesterday was bioterrorism so today is [LAUGH] a little bit better.
L:  Yeah, I guess a little bit lighter.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, I don't know, the -- probably the only sports that I really enjoy watching on TV a lot is hockey, and that's over now.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  And I probably watch maybe a hour a week, but my husband watches way more.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  I was gonna say, it seems to be kind of a guy thing to spend a lot of time watching sports on TV.  
R:  Yeah.  But I'll watch baseball too, but you know, that gets boring after a while, too.
L:  Yeah, baseball's fun, although I'd rather catch it live.  I live in Boston --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- but it's just not the same, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You see a Red Sox game at Centerway Park and that's a whole other thing than watching it at home.
R:  Absolutely, and the only reason I would watch it at home is 'cause my husband's watching it.  [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.
R:  So he rule -- rules the remote.  Um, but gosh, he watches soccer and so I watch that with him.  He watches football, which I don't watch with him [LAUGH].  I'm not much of a football fan, so --
L:  Yeah.  I kinda come from a football family so I watch it now and then, more out of nostalgia than actually [LAUGH] following --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  -- the game.  
R:  Yeah.  I was always the odd person out because uh actually my uh brother went to Purdue and then uh we lived in an area near Notre Dame, that's where I grew up, and so there was always the rivalry in our house with the Notre Dame and the Purdue games and --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- but I -- I -- I was, like, whatever.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  My family has some Red Sox, Yankees rivalries.
R:  There you go.
L:  'Cause we're kinda spread between New England and New York, but -- which is fun.  It's kind of a funny thing, but I don't know that it leads to my watching any more baseball.  [LAUGH].
R:  No.  No.  And -- and it's really funny how people can get so serious about their competition, where I'm just kind of flippant, like, oh I'm bombed out.  I'm a big Cubs fan 'cause I did grow up in that area and so um if they lose -- well, that's kind of a given, not lately but usually [LAUGH] with the Cubs.
L:  [MN].
R:  So, but I'm just like, "Oh well, I was kinda bombed that they lost", but that's okay.  
L:  Mm.  
R:  Are you competitive when you watch sports at all?
L:  No, not really.  I don't really, you know -- like, if I'm watching it with a group of people?
R:  Mhm?
L:  Get competitive?  No.  
R:  No, me neither.
L:  No.  Well, I do catch the Super Bowl and when it's -- when it's the Pats.
R:  Oh.
L:  You know?  That -- that can get some emotions going, but I think that's more the crowd you're in and who you're watching it with.
R:  Oh, yeah.  That's --
L:  I wouldn't even necessarily watch it by myself, but if I'm with a group of people, at like a Super Bowl party or a bar or something, then people definitely get more involved and -- and active and yelling about everything.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I do it more of in a fun way, not a competitive way 'cause my -- um, we live in Houston now and so whenever the Cubs come to town and play the Astros, my allegiance is always to the Cubs.  [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.
R:  So when I'm watching it with my husband we just, you know, trade comments back and forth [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Just dogging each other's team and so it's kind of interesting.
L:  That's cute.  
R:  So, but the -- you know, it's all fun for me.  It's --
L:  Yeah.  It seems that more women's sports are getting on TV.
R:  Yeah.  Um, here in Houston they have a women's softball team.
L:  Cool.
R:  And although I'm from Indiana, I've never really [LAUGH] been into basketball.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I know I'm supposed to be, just 'cause I'm from Indiana.  [LAUGH].
L:  I like women's soccer.
R:  Oh, yeah.  That's awesome.
L:  That's a lot of fun.
R:  Yeah.  That's awesome to watch.  But I'm trying to think.  My husband will watch any sport on TV.  He's even watched cricket --
L:  [LAUGH]. 
R:  -- from --
L:  That's serious. 
R:  Yeah, I'm telling ya.  Well, he's been over to England a couple times so he saw it live and so I guess --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's what got him into it.
L:  That's really kinda like watching the World Cup, though, the soccer play offs.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Because that is so much more international.  I think Americans maybe do their sports a little bit differently and a little --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- more wildly.  I don't think people in other countries paint their faces and --
R:  No.  [LAUGH].
L:  -- put on costumes and do all that insane stuff.
R:  No.  [LAUGH] but I think also uh -- well, I -- I don't want to say that, 'cause a lot of times when people, when there's riots and stuff --
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  -- that --
L:  That's true.  We usually avoid that.
R:  Uh, I know.  Yeah, I know in other countries, you know, like people are really serious about their sports and they, like, kill each other over it, which is insane to me.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's right.  I spent a semester in London and they used to do field trips to football games, soccer games.
R:  Oh.
L:  But they stopped doing it because they're afraid of liability, of like students' parents suing in case there was a riot and --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- someone got hurt at the game.
R:  Crazy.  But um I think, like, volleyball is interesting to watch and tennis, somewhat, just sit there, you're watching a ball go back and forth, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's still neat to see it when they -- they miss it [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah. 
R:  I guess.
L:  Well, the Williams' sisters are fun to watch.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, definitely.
L:  They're pretty amazing.
R:  And it's interesting to watch it on the different um court [several inaudible words] so but it -- like, watching the Olympics is pretty awesome.
L:  Mm.
R:  You know, watching sports on TV.  Like, I love the swimming.  That was great.  But um I'm just trying to think of other things, sports, that we watch on TV.
L:  Yeah.  It sounds like you watch a lot more than I do.  It's a little sad, actually, because I was talking on here a couple of days ago --
R:  Uh-huh?
L:  -- and the subject was reality TV shows.
R:  Oh.
L:  And I realized how many of those things that I've been watching.
R:  Oh.
L:  That was a little startling.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] that is pretty funny.
L:  Like, oh my God, I spend that much time every week watching reality TV?
R:  Right.  Well, there's so much of it out there now, but um I guess part of my uh deal, why I have seen so many sports on is 'cause my husband's a TV person so we always have the TV on, where -- I mean, I'm not saying that I don't watch TV [LAUGH] but --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I'll probably opt for music over TV more often than not.  
L:  Yeah --
R:  So once --
L:  -- I was just going to ask, what would you do if -- if the remote was in your hand?
R:  Uh, well, during the day it is because my husband's [LAUGH] at work so --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I don't know.  I watch a lot of uh game shows and --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- gotta watch Dr Phil.  [LAUGH].  But um no sports.  I don't opt to watch sports.
L:  Mhm?
R:  I never really choose to watch sport.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I like hockey on TV.  I can follow it.  I -- and it's kinda like baseball.  I do like it in person better.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I'll watch it on TV.  It's not bad.  
L:  Well, yeah, I don't think I've ever watched a hockey game --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- on TV.  Mhm.
R:  Oh, my husband got me into it 'cause I never had watched hockey before and he's like a fanatic.  And out of all the sports that he can be fanatical about, that to me is a good one.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I specially like it, living in Houston, to go to the games because you go inside and you're a wh- you're really cool which --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- doesn't happen very often, 'cause it's so hot here.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess it would have a different -- different attraction here in the chilly north.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  We're cold all the time anyway.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  But uh of course, you don't get that effect when you're watching it on TV unless you crank down the AC.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  So --
L:  You don't get the full experience.
R:  That's right.  [LAUGH].  I'm surprised my husband hasn't asked me to do that, but [LAUGH] -- he's too much of a miser to go that far.
L:  [LAUGH].  
R:  But uh, you know, he goes as far as wearing his jersey and [LAUGH] getting all decked out for the game.
L:  Mm.
R:  I'm like, oh geeze, you're at home.  [LAUGH].  Nobody's gonna see you but me.  I know you're loyal.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  So.  I'm trying to think of anything else.  
L:  I know.  I -- I was afraid I'd run out of steam on this topic pretty quickly.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's tough.  I don't know.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  
R:  I don't know what else.  I'm trying to think.  Ten minutes is a long time when it's a topic that you're not well versed on.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, really.
R:  How many calls have you done?
L:  This is my second one.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, how about you?
R:  This is my first, so -- my first.  I got a call yesterday, but unfortunately I left my phone upstairs and I was changing my son's diaper, so --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- it really wasn't convenient.
L:  Not the time.
R:  [LAUGH].  So -- and I tried calling in and you know, I was just on hold for a long time so like I guess nobody's available.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got matched up with your number immediately I called in.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, that's great.
L:  For a moment it worked.
R:  Oh, great.  So I don't know what else.  
L:  Mm.
R:  Well, you know, like sometimes you see uh neat things like skateboarding and stuff on TV.
L:  Yeah, that's kinda cool.
R:  Or skating. 
L:  Like snowboarding and like the newer --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- extreme sport kinda thing?
R:  Exactly.  [LAUGH].  'Cause you wanna -- you know, you don't want them to get hurt, but it's really cool when they wipe out.
L:  It's cool to watch, yeah.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  Or it's really cool when they actually make something, and you're like, how'd they do that?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I wonder if that's getting younger people?
R:  Yeah.  Definitely.
L:  Into mo- watching more sports?  Yeah.  A friend of mine just joined um a women's pro football team.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  Full contact.  Yeah.  And it's -- I wonder if that sort of thing will ever get broadcast?  I'm sure there's a million Cable channels so someone's going to cover it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- at some point.  I don't think it'll ever get as prevalent as men's sports, but --
R:  Right.  Right.  Well, that's one of our big um beefs.  Like, here in Houston, um, we have a minor league hockey team --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and --
