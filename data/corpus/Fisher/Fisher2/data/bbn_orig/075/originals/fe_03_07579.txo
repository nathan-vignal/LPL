R:  [LIPSMACK] Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.  Who am I speaking with?
L:  This is Martha.  Who are you please?
R:  Martha, my name's Charles.
L:  Charles, okay.
R:  How're you doing?
L:  I'm doing fine.  So, do you have a favorite sports that you watch?
R:  I, um [SIGH] -- basically, I love basketball.
L:  Do you love --
R:  I think that's --
L:  -- basket- --
R:  -- probably my favorite sport.  How --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- about you? [NOISE]
L:  Pro basketball or college?
R:  Pr- -- I like pro.  I like the --
L:  You like the pro.
R:  -- NBA.  Yeah.
L:  We watch the, um -- the college more than we do the pro.  Uh, I guess my favorite sports would be, um, baseball, um, or golfing.  I like to watch golfing, the women golfing especially.  I like that.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, who's your favorite team?  Do you have a favorite, um ...
R:  In terms of ba- -- in terms of -- in terms of sports, I really don't -- I mean, I like teams.  There are particular teams that I like but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I'm more into players.  So --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- off times I would -- you know, I might like -- like, I like Iverson.  I like Allen Iverson, I like Toby Brittian.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Uh, in terms of baseball, I -- I like Sosa.  I like --
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  -- uh, I like Ripien.
L:  Okay.
R:  Uh, I like Clemens.  Um, [COUGH] [LIPSMACK] I like --
L:  Where you --
R:  -- uh -- I like -- I like Dave Mirria -- there -- there -- it [LAUGH] -- it would take [LAUGH] like forever to -- if I were to list all of the different --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- people that I like.  And it goes back.
L:  Yes, what do you --
R:  It goes back --
L:  -- think of --
R:  -- you know.
L:  -- yeah, what do you think of Sosa and his corked bat?
R:  That's -- that's -- uh, you know, it's -- it's questionable now.  Apparently --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you got to bear in mind -- I'm -- I'm a, uh -- I'm a news +broad -- broadcasting, uh, student at --
L:  Oh, are you?
R:  -- North Car- --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- at North Carolina A and T.
L:  Oh, wonderful.
R:  And I've been in radio for ten years.  I've done --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- a lot in the way of news, so at -- from -- from a journalist -- from a journalistic standpoint --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if he only had one bat -- if they --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- looked at seventy six others that were supposedly his, none of those were corked.  Then it is possible that it could've been a mistake.
L:  Yes.
R:  I -- I would -- I would -- I would -- I would think.
L:  Yes but --
R:  What about you?
L:  Well, should he ha- have had one in the first place?  This is what I -- I question.
R:  Why should he have had a corked bat?
L:  Yes, uh --
R:  That's a good question.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That -- that's a fair question.
L:  Well, now --
R:  That's a fair --
L:  -- I agree with you.
R:  -- question.  Now, if it -- now, I would -- now, okay -- now, if he were to use that bat in practice --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- if he were to use that bat, say, just you know -- I mean, he didn't mean to use it in a game.  If --
L:  Yes, I know that.
R:  -- he's just using it -- if he's just using it to see how much, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to see what the difference is, you know what I mean?  I mean, I don't know. [COUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't -- uh, you know.
L:  Yeah and, uh --
R:  And --
L:  -- I agree.
R:  -- and -- and it's not like -- you know, I mean, the quest- -- I think the question is, "How many players have these co- -- these --"
L:  Yes.
R:  "-- corked bats?"
L:  Yes.
R:  And the question is, "How many of them are using them in the games?"
L:  Yes, I'll agree with you.
R:  The question is -- the question -- the que- -- another question is, "Did he -- had he previously used this bat?"
L:  Oh, I don't think so [LAUGH].  I love --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- say, I love Sammy.  I don't think -- think Sammy would do that intentionally. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, all right.  Well, that's -- yeah, you know --
L:  Uh-huh --
R:  You know.
L:  But, uh, I mean, uh, it just -- you know, it makes it -- it -- just thinks it -- and of course, you know there is people that -- you know, that would find anything wrong with somebody, then over blow it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yes.
R:  Exactly --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- exactly.  And see, that's the problem with media.
L:  Yes.
R:  All right, I -- I'm -- you know, again, I'm into news.  I've always been into news and the --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- reason I got involved in news is because a lot of times stories are printed, they're slanted.  They're biased and they're -- and they're -- and they're often unfavorable because -- because the positive story often times, doesn't shine --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- a- as -- as a story that's negative.  It's like people want to read about negativity for whatever reason.  I don't know why that seems to --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] uh, gain a --
L:  Oh, we --
R:  -- a larger audience.
L:  Yes, I agree with you Charles.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I pick -- when I pick up the paper in the morning, uh, I try to look for something good in the paper --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and there's -- er, even in the sports, you can't hardly find anything good.
R:  And --
L:  -- and --
R:  -- it's sad.  You know what I mean?  You know --
L:  And even --
R:  -- it's like --
L:  Yes.  You know that horse race that lost?  Remember, he lost, um -- oh, what's his name?  The horse that was -- or do you watch horse racing?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, I heard about that Belmont Stakes.  Now, I'm not big on horse racing but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- there was something -- I think Sunnyside --
L:  Yeah, Sunnyside --
R:  -- was the --
L:  -- like --
R:  -- yeah.
L:  -- yes.  Oh, we were pulling for him so hard. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I mean, I wanted him to win.  You know what I mean?
L:  Yes, uh-huh.  Because, you know, he's -- he's, uh -- well, you know, he just should've won. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh -- uh, so what kind of -- are you into, uh, sports broadcasting, or just any kind of broadcasting?
R:  I -- I need to be -- I wish I had been like -- like my -- my -- my best friend --
L:  Right.
R:  -- uh, you know, I'm from Connecticut and my best friend, he used to read the New York -- the New York, uh -- what is it?  The New York Post -- what is the --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- sport -- there's a sports -- there's a sports paper out in New York.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's like the New York s- s- -- I can't remember what the name -- I think it's the New York Post.
L:  Okay.
R:  And it's basically -- and -- and a lot of it has to do with sports [LIPSMACK] and he used to read that religiously, like from the time we were like ten, eleven years old --
L:  Oh, all right.
R:  -- up.  You know what I mean?  Like eleven, twelve -- well, probably maybe more like twelve.
L:  Mhm.
R:  From the time we were like twelve years old.  I'm forty three now, so --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- you know.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But y- -- in order to be a, uh -- in order to be an effective, uh -- in order to be an entertaining, in order to be an informative, uh, sports caster, you have to -- you have to have that information down.
L:  Yes.
R:  And you have to be able to recall it, you know, with- without --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- without any -- w- wi- with just -- just off the top of your head --
L:  Without any [inaudible] notes.
R:  -- and I don't --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- yeah and I don't think I -- I don't think I have enough -- I don't think --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I have enough of a -- of a base -- of a sports base.  I mean, I -- I [COUGH] -- I love sports.  Don't --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- get me wrong but I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just don't think I'm -- I don't know if I'm well enough versed --
L:  Do you get to watch --
R:  -- to --
L:  -- uh, much sports on TV, or are you too busy --
R:  Oh, yeah --
L:  -- uh-huh --
R:  -- yeah.
L:  -- do you?  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, I mean, I watch -- I watch -- but -- but then again, there are often times, like you know, like -- like, all right, I'm going to summer school now, which kind of sucks but it --
L:  Yes --
R:  -- it -- it's --
L:  -- oh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, uh -- but -- but it's -- it's messed up because you go to class every day, whereas, like sometimes and, uh -- off times classes during -- in the fall, you only have to go like, maybe two or three times a week.
L:  Okay.
R:  [LIPSMACK] This is every day, so it's a little more intense and you know, y- you -- you just -- and so there are times when I can't -- I can't really watch TV.  Like --
L:  Well, we --
R:  -- I missed --
L:  -- watch --
R:  -- the last game.  I missed the last, uh, NBA game, when San Antonio --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- won.  You know what I mean?
L:  Who's gonna -- who's gonna win the, um -- er, who's even playing now?  I don't even who's -- who's the final --
R:  They won.  Uh, San Antonio won.  They're the --
L:  Did they win?
R:  champs.
L:  Okay, that's how much I'm into basketball.  We don't watch [NOISE] much basketball.  It -- it, uh -- we are into baseball and -- and golfing mainly.  Uh, my husband has the --
R:  Well, what do you think about Tiger?  What do you think -- what do you think about his, uh --
L:  Oh, I love Tiger. [LAUGH]
R:  You like Tiger?
L:  Yes.  I think -- think he's, uh -- well, I think he's good for the kids.  What do you think, for the young --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for the young --
R:  I think he's -- I think he's good for the kids and I also think he's good for, uh, s- -- golf has largely been and somewhat of an elitist -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- type of sports.
L:  Yes, uh-huh.
R:  It's a tend to tennis --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- in that way.  Uh, in the sense that there weren't many minorities --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that were -- that were participating in the past.  And so, I think it's good that he, um -- [LIPSMACK] that -- that -- that more -- that more minorities want to get involved.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I think it's good that not only that, that the major- -- that the majority, um, are -- are beginning -- are beginning to open up more --
L:  Oh, I hope so.
R:  -- to -- to allowing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, others to --
L:  Well, what do --
R:  -- to -- to -- to partic- -- to participate.
L:  Well, what do you think of women playing in the men's sports?
R:  I think -- you know, I'm a black man, okay.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I'm an African American, so I would --
L:  Right.
R:  -- be a fool -- I would be an -- I would be an --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- anus --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- if I were to sit here --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] and say --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and -- and not only that, I mean --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- just -- just -- just in terms of my heart.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I think anybody -- I'm always like for the underdog.  You know, I --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I always like --
L:  Yes, uh --
R:  -- you know, so, if somebody's being, you know, kept out of something, you know, especially for an unfair reason --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I don't think that's cool, so, you know, I think any time -- you know, hey, [NOISE] if a woman can come -- you know, uh -- you know, when I was younger --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I used to -- I used -- I couldn't stand, like if my girlfriend would beat me in sports or something --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- or if a girl beat me --
L:  -- really?
R:  -- uh, it used to --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- tear me --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- up, right.
L:  [LAUGH] Yes.
R:  But that -- but I've got to the point -- I've gotten -- I've gotten older and I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- realize that, you know --
L:  Well --
R:  -- I mean, like my -- my -- my -- my ex used to beat me in pool.  She was just --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- better than I was.
L:  Oh, good. [LAUGH]
R:  And it used to kill me.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I used to --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- like -- I would be like -- I would be enraged.  It was like insane but I would never let her know.  And we used to live next door to a bar that had like three pool tables -- well, two pool --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- tables in there and so, after she started beating me like that, I said, "Oh, my God, I can't believe this".  I couldn't handle it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, every day when I got off work, [LIPSMACK] I'd be in that bar playing pool every --
L:  Well --
R:  -- day.  Every --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- day.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I got better.  I got better.  But ultimately, Anika -- Anika Sorenson --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] uh, you know, she deserves to play in any -- in --
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  -- any -- in any, uh -- in any tournament that she can -- that she can get into and they -- and they ought to allow her to --
L:  She's a good --
R:  -- you know and because --
L:  -- she --
R:  -- yeah, go ahead.
L:  She's good and she's a good show -- show person just to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what -- you know, what it --
R:  And she -- a- and she's -- and she's got a real nice -- she's got a very -- a very even demeanor.
L:  Yes --
R:  You know --
L:  -- uh-huh.
R:  -- she's really -- she's really, uh -- she really seems like a really decent person.
L:  Yes, uh-huh.
R:  You know what I mean?  So --
L:  I -- I think she's good for golfing and -- well, I think anybody that can -- can encourage the younger people to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to do things like this, you know, like her playing in the men's tournament and -- and Tiger, he can en- encourage the young people in the minority people.  So, that -- that's wonderful, I think.  I -- I'm all for that.
R:  I think males -- I think males need to get off of the --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- chauvinistic --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- thing.  And I can be chauvinistic at times, so I don't want to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- sound hypocritical but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I think males -- males -- I mean, females -- I mean, give them a chance.  Give them a chance.
L:  Yes -- 
R:  Give them a --
L:  -- yes, uh-huh.
R:  -- chance to compete and if you can -- if you can beat them, beat them.
L:  Yes.
R:  If you can't, then just -- then -- then just swallow your pride and deal with it and go practice and get better until you can beat them.  You know --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- what I'm saying?  But --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- but give everybody -- uh, just give everybody a chance --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- to -- to be involved.  I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think that's only fair.
L:  Yeah.  So, do -- do you, um, read the sports?  I guess you read the sports section and you watch --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the TV and --
R:  Yeah.  Have you ever watched the Best Darned -- well, it's not Darned but the Best Darned Sports Show o- on --
L:  Yes, my husband --
R:  -- TV?
L:  -- watches it.  It's like --
R:  Isn't that good?  Do you think --
L:  Yes, it is.
R:  -- that's good?
L:  Well, my hus- -- hey, we -- we have the satellite here.  We -- we live in Kennett, Missouri --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and there -- there is not -- there is not -- we don't get -- we don't even pick up Saint Louis.  We have to have -- we -- we can't even get the Cardinals and they're our State.
R:  Oh, man. 
L:  Yeah and so, he has satellite and we still can't get them.  We have satellite baseball, you know, wh- which he pays extra each year for that and we still can't get the Cardinals. [LAUGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK] It's amazing how --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, how technologically advanced we are and yet there's still some areas --
L:  Black outs.
R:  -- of the US where --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you know and then -- and then what's really stupid is that if you live in a -- if you live in a certain city or a certain State --
L:  This is it.
R:  -- and -- and you can't -- and you get blacked out, you -- you can't watch, er, a game -- your own home -- your own home team.
L:  We're almost three hundred miles -- two hundred fifty miles from Saint Louis and we still are black --
