L:  Hi, good evening.  My name is May.
R:  Hi.  I'm Donna.
L:  How are you?
R:  Well, I'm very good.  Very good.
L:  We -- um, I live in Canada.  What about yourself?
R:  In Canada?  I'm in Salem, Oregon.
L:  Oh, okay.  So we --
R:  [MN].
L:  -- both have fears of terr- bioterrorism?
R:  Oh, yes we do.  Yes.  Uh-huh.  Uh, where in Canada are you?  Uh, what province?
L:  I'm in Ontario.  I'm in Toronto.  You must have heard of us.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We are the forest capital of the world.
R:  Yes.  Mhm.  Um, I'm familiar with, uh -- I have parents in, uh, Edmonton, so --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I'm familiar with uh, the other -- the other side of Canada.
L:  Fair enough.
R:  Uh-huh.  Um, the topic was, uh -- I didn't write it down.
L:  Bioterrorism, I believe.
R:  Uh, what we can do to, uh -- what our countries can do to prevent, or what -- what --
L:  I think basically they just want us to talk.
R:  Okay.  Talk about --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  Um, and um -- actually, I -- in Canada, we're not that worried about bioterrorism because um we believe the terrorists don't um bother us in Canada, but judging from our SARS outbreak, uh, we would have a great deal of difficulty in our healthcare system if we did have a bioterrorism attack.
R:  Yes.  Mhm.  Now, um, I -- I know I had read about uh -- uh, the SARS and uh what travel had been uh -- uh, put off or uh reduced uh --
L:   It was not recommended to come to Canada.  [LAUGH].
R:   Not recommended to come to that area.  I mean, to --
L:   Exactly.
R:   Uh-huh.  Now, is that -- is it just a recommendation?  There has not been anything uh put out to -- I mean, prevent?  Someone can still travel there, but uh it's just not recommended?
L:   Exactly.
R:   Okay.  Mhm.
L:   Um, the World Health Organization had suggested um that if you need to travel, it's -- uh, it is only um if you really do need to travel, but the travel ban has been lifted, so I would imagine if we had a bioterrorism um alert, that would be the same thing.
R:   Mhm.  Mhm.
L:   Right.  Do you find your life has changed, um, in fear of bioterrorism at all?
R:   It um -- well, it has changed in that I uh -- uh, the family, where I live, more um -- I guess the word -- I guess careful in uh when we are uh in a mall --
L:   Oh, yeah.
R:   -- uh, shopping.
L:   Okay.
R:   That we are -- I th- I think that we are more aware of those around us.
L:   That's okay.
R:   And it isn't that we are uh profiling, but uh just based on what the -- as -- as to who the -- uh, the terrorists have been, that we -- I guess one is a little more --
L:   Cautious?
R:   Cautious, uh-huh.
L:   What city did you say you lived in?
R:   Salem, Oregon.
L:   Sorry?
R:   Salem.
L:   Salem?
R:   Uh-huh.  
L:   Oh, okay.  What's the population of Salem?
R:   We are uh less than a hundred thousand.
L:   Okay.  That's a tiny place.
R:   Yes.  [LAUGH].  It's a tiny place.  Uh, we are near uh Portland.  We are near Seattle, Washington.
L:   Okay.
R:   And so we uh do have uh -- and Los Angeles, California.
L:   Okay.
R:   So on the west coast, there are some major cities.  Uh, we are the state capital.
L:   Oh, okay.
R:   But uh, no, we haven't uh -- uh -- the city has started some uh preparation.  They've had some mock attacks at the university and various places.  They've gone through that to see if uh, um, doing the um -- prep- you know, in preparation, but --
L:   Oh, so that's pretty good, that your city is um preparing its uh residents just in case something may happen.
R:   Mhm.  Mhm.
L:   Well, since you said you are the -- you are -- you live in the state capital, if -- I guess if the terrorists knows their geography, they may want to strike a capital [LAUGH].  
R:   Yes.  True.
L:   As opposed to --
R:   Yes, I think that they probably would, if they wanted to get uh -- uh, you know, cut uh -- cut off the uh the powers that be and, you know, in the state.
L:   That -- oh, I see.
R:   So -- but outside of that, we have -- uh, there's more of a fear of um -- of those I think that live in Portland, Seattle, but basically it's um -- it wasn't long after nine eleven that it was basically back to business.
L:   Okay.
R:   Um, there was still the -- the fear and I believe that the uh -- um, the younger -- the younger ones, um -- was, you know, hard for them, as it is, do anything, for the really young ones.
L:   But for yourself, are you doing anything, um, to um -- in case of bioterrorism, like do you keep a supply of water or some uh dry food that you could eat in case of --
R:   Well, we -- I do -- we do have, uh -- we had started that uh, oh, some time ago.  My husband -- now, we're retired.
L:   Okay.  Oh.
R:   And uh -- but we do have a daughter living in this town, but we do have an area that -- we haven't uh started the water.  We should get some bottled water and -- and have it here, but we do have some uh food that uh could be eaten.
L:   Okay.
R:   Uh-huh, and we do have um -- we do have a cell phone.  Uh, we have a -- we have a cat so we do have the cat's uh -- uh -- uh, thing for the cat.
L:   Okay.
R:   Uh, at -- ready, in one particular area, and um --
L:   Do you have any fear of -- uh, of a bioterrorism attack?
R:   No.  Not -- like, no, I don't -- I don't fear it.  I guess for my -- I guess for myself, we're in our seventies so --
L:   Oh, you sound very young for being --
R:   Oh, no.  No.
L:   -- in your seventies?
R:   No, we're retired, in our seventies, but -- but I do for my children and the grandchildren.
L:   Right.
R:   Uh-huh, and uh I guess um -- well, I guess when you get uh -- the older you get, the more you, you know, accept that uh it isn't that we don't love life, but uh, it is not something that --
L:   Is forever?
R:   We're -- we're just not going to uh -- uh, worry about it.  We'll take precautions --
L:   Okay.
R:   -- but we're not going to uh worry ourselves to -- to death over it.
L:   Fair enough.  Right.
R:   And how about you?  Do you have family?
L:   Uh, no.  I don't have family.  Um, I have bottled wattle -- bottled water at home anyhow, so um I guess I'm -- I don't really have that much really interesting food.  I just have, like, the tin cans.
R:   Mhm.
L:   Um, but you know, it's sort of like vegetables or something and um I guess I'll -- I'll have lots of water.
R:   Uh-huh.
L:   Bottles of water.
R:   Okay.  Okay.  Yeah.
L:   And my freezer's full, but that won't help if um, you know, the power goes off.
R:   Mhm.  Mhm.
L:   But, uh, we in Canada, we don't have fears like that.
R:   Mhm.
L:   Uh, no, my greatest fear is that our hospital system may not um be able to handle it.  Like, wha- um, I -- it can -- may not be able to handle it because I read about a report saying that and also when we had our first SARS outbreak, um, we had a second SARS outbreak, like, two months later.
R:   Mhm?
L:   Um, after we thought that, you know, SARS was a dead issue.  It's the healthcare workers that got reinfected and did reinfect other people.
R:   Mm.  Mm.
L:   So um you know, that can be a problem.
R:   Oh, yes.  Yeah.  
L:   And um --
R:   And how about those uh -- those that you work with?  Uh, 'cause most everyone at -- where your place of a business at --
L:   Actually, I don't work.  I sort of just hang out at home.
R:   Oh, all right.  Okay.  Uh --
L:   But I'm quite sure, um, my friends just -- like, we don't have any concern about bioterrorism because we --
R:   Mhm.  Mhm.
L:   -- think it's a US problem.  And actually, if you can remember, our prime minister did not support the war.
R:   Yes, I know.  And it -- it -- uh, I know, and then there was -- uh, I watch a particular uh show on Fox channel --
L:   Uh-huh.
R:   -- called the O'Reilly Factor, and I know that there were several -- they had several comments that they were urging people not to travel to Canada because they weren't uh in support of us.
L:   Sure.
R:   Yeah.
L:   Well, yeah.
R:   Mhm.
L:   You know, it's um -- like, actually I did support the war and um the prime minister basically spoke for himself.
R:   Mhm.  Well, that's what -- you know, we wouldn't know that here, unless we hear it actually from someone, you know, like you saying that because one would tend to think that -- that all Canadians um wanted -- you know, did not uh share in uh our concerns, and uh -- uh were just saying basically, you know, "We don't have anything to worry about, so we don't really care", but it's nice to know that -- you -- you know, you all did care --
L:   Right.
R:   -- but -- mhm.
L:   Um, even like there was quite a moot point because our army is very antiquated.
R:   Mhm.
L:   And our soldiers have bad equipment and poor clothes and that good stuff.
R:   Uh-huh?
L:   Even if we wanted to send, we would not be of that much help --
R:   Uh-huh.
L:   -- but we should of just sent anyhow.  I mean, um --
R:   Yeah.
L:   You know, it's just -- like, you know, it's not fair that another country fights for freedom and we just --
R:   Well, yes.  Uh-huh.
L:   -- sit back and wait until the war -- and then after the war ended, we were complaining that we were not -- some of the chosen -- our Canadian companies were not some of the chosen companies to help, you know, give back.
R:   Yes, to rebuild it.  To rebuild Iraq.
L:   Yeah.  So I mean --
R:   Right.  Uh-huh.
L:   -- if you're not there for the bad parts, why are you there just for the good parts?
R:   Mhm.  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:   You know, so it's -- it's very understandable.
R:   Yeah.  But I don't think that the uh relations between the two countries is um harmed -- you know, it -- it's harmed, but I don't bel- I don't mean it's --
