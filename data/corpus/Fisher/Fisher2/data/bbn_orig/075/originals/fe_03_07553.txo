R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  I'm Rose.
R:  I'm [inaudible].
L:  Where are you from?
R:  I'm from Texas.  Where are you from?
L:  Florida.
R:  Great.  Do you and your husband do this?
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  Do you and your husband both do this?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Okay.  I talked to your husband last time.
L:  Did you? 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  What was the topic then?
R:  Ah, reality TV shows, like Survivor. 
L:  Well see, I always get the bioterrorism and --
R:  You do?
L:  -- airplane security and -- I always get the hard ones.
R:  Ah.  [LAUGH]. This one's actually easier than the last one, because me or your husband don't watch Survivor, those shows, so it was kinda retarded for us --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- to talk about that, so --
L:  Oh, that's funny.  [LAUGH].  But do you really think that we are protected from bioterrorism?  Because I -- I don't think so.
R:  Oh, well, I think if we would stay out of other people's business, we wouldn't have a threat.
L:  Well, I agree with that.  Definitely.  
R:  Because we always butt into everyone's business, and nine eleven probably would not have happened if we wouldn't have started the Persian Gulf --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or the Iran contra scandal and stuff like that.  It would just not -- would not be happening right now, so --
L:  I told my husband --
R:  They're --
L:  -- when they elected George Bush, "They got a Texan in there" and the only thing he's thinking about is what he can do with a shotgun.
R:  Exactly.  Especially with Saddam, because he tried to assassinate his father.
L:  Right.
R:  So I don't -- it is I -- it honestly -- bioterrorism just scares the hell out of me.
L:  Oh, it does --
R:  Every time we hear --
L:  -- me, too.
R:  I'm just, like, freaked out about that.  It just -- oh.  I don't think the -- yeah, I agree, there's nothing we can do to, like -- like, help it, like, not happen.
L:  And I don't believe people freaked out so bad and went and bought all the duct tape that they did.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Or- over here, they -- we had no duct tape in, like, home before or anything for, like, at least a week and a half.
L:  Yeah.  We didn't either, and I'm thinking --
R:  It was --
L:  -- you know, you can seal off the windows and everything, but if you seal off the air --
R:  You're not gonna be able to breathe.
L:  Exactly.  So there's really no point.
R:  People were buying gas masks over here.  My neighbors have, like, three of them in your house.  I'm like, "You guys are weird". 
L:  You're kidding?
R:  Yeah.  I'm like, more people die from putting those on than they do from actual chemicals, 'cause they don't know how to put them on right.
L:  Oh, I didn't know that.
R:  Yeah.  They suffocate, 'cause they can't put them on right.  They don't know how to.
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  I'm serious.  It's been, like, all over the news.  Like, when that first -- when it first started happening, like probably in ninety five when they first started freaking out about it.
L:  Yeah?
R:  That's -- there was, like, more cases of suffocation then.
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  Yeah.  It was really bad.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  I figure, like, that um -- I lived in Ohio and I was really close to, right, Patterson Airforce Base?
R:  Uh-huh?
L:  And now that I live here I'm like, right by [inaudible].  Pretty much that's the, uh, centre.
R:  Yeah, I'm -- yeah, I'm like --
L:  So --
R:  I'm right by an international airport.
L:  Yes.  I mean, I'm gone --
R:  'Cause I'm in Dallas.
L:  I'm gone as soon as it happens.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  I know.  
L:  And honestly, I don't want to be around after it happens anyway.
R:  Exactly.  I'd -- like, if it did happen, yeah, I'd like it to just get over, like, really quick.
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  Rather than, like -- 'cause you -- if you -- if you um -- if you, like, watch the news when they're interviewing those company -- or those countries where Saddam's had the biochemicals --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's the -- they have so bad nerve problems.  Like, this one guy they're interviewing, like, he was -- he was just standing there and they're interviewing him, and then all of a sudden, like, his legs went out.  He's like, "This happens to me, like, once or twice a week.  It's all because of the nerve agent they used when they were bombing our country".
L:  Oh, my God.  
R:  That's just horrible.  Like, I couldn't -- especially with, like, little kids.  That's what bothers me the most, is about the little kids.
L:  Yeah.  Definitely.
R:  That's just horrible.  They have -- they have a song about it out right now.  One of the rap -- on of -- this guy, he made a song about, like, our war right now, about like chemical warfare and stuff.
L:  I haven't heard it.
R:  Yeah, it just came out like, you know, like three weeks ago.
L:  Okay.
R:  Oh well, it came out here at least.  I don't know if anywhere else did.
L:  We're always way behind.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, yeah.  Are you still -- well, when I was in California, we were always ahead and like when I came to Texas, like I was like three years ahead of everyone else.  I was, like, mm, like fashion wise.  But music goes to New York and then California and then sort of and then Dallas, so --
L:  Isn't that weird?
R:  Yeah.  I was just -- I'm just freaking out because European fashion right now is really weird and that's supposed to come to us within the next year and a half and I'm like, "No".
L:  Oh, no.  
R:  [LAUGH].  Just --
L:  See, I was -- I was okay with [inaudible] and all of that, but I don't know if I can do the weird stuff.
R:  I can't.  I'll be like -- I'll be -- I'll be untrendy for a couple years --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
R:  -- but I don't care.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  It's better than looking back at a picture, going, "What the hell was I thinking?"
R:  Yeah.  I look at my mom's pictures from high school, because she went to the high school in the eighties and I'm just, like, "You wore that?"  
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I'm like "Yo, geeze".  
L:  Yeah.  I'm one of those big hair, lots of makeup eighties type of people.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, my mom was one of those scungy[?], like, not the big hair, not like the hit salsa, but the weird, "Why'd you wear that stuff?"
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I'm like -- it wasn't like the --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Like what everyone was doing.  She had her -- like, seventies style hair style with her probably like fifties style clothing and I'm like, "You wore that?"
L:  [LAUGH].  That's funny.
R:  Yes.
L:  My mom, when I look at pictures of her, and she looks like Mary Tyler Moore, I swear.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  My dad was a total, like, Kiss fan when he was in high school.  He totally looked -- have you seen the [inaudible]?
L:  Yeah.
R:  He looks like one of those guys and I'm like --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh.
R:  How can you get on me about what I wear?
L:  Oh, my God.  My dad was, like, the biggest nerd.  
R:  Oh.
L:  It was, like, I was looking at pictures of him and I swear it was like, um, Beaver.  
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH].
L:  Beaver Cleaver.  That's what he looked like.
R:  Oh, my.
L:  It was scary.  And then they had a picture of me when I was five, and my dad is wearing these striped bellbottoms.
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH].
L:  With this checkered shirt.  I don't know what he was thinking.  [LAUGH].
L:   [LAUGH].  My dad tries to walk out the house, he'll wear, like, olive green pants with, like, a lighter green shirt and, like, he'll wear brown shoes.
L:   [LAUGH].  
R:   I'm like, "What are you doing?"  
L:   [LAUGH].
R:   My mom's always getting on at him, too, about it.  [LAUGH].
L:   You know what?  My daughter visits with my father all the time --
R:   [MN].
L:   -- and she goes, like, "Oh, this has gotta go.  This is gone".  [LAUGH].  And then she takes me shopping.
R:   My step mom does a -- it -- like, because my step mom and me are the same size, so [several inaudible words] closet, I'm like, yes --
L:   Oh, right.
R:   -- but she does the same thing to me.  She goes through my closet and she goes, "You're not going to wear this any more".  I'm like, "It's my favorite shirt".  "It's old".  Like, "No".
L:   I have stuff that I wore in high school still [LAUGH].
R:   I have shoes that I've worn that I still have and I've worn them since fourth grade and I am going into my senior year.
L:   Oh, my God.
R:   And they still fit me.  Yeah.
L:   [LAUGH].  My daughter is your age.  
R:   She's in -- she's a senior?
L:   Yeah.  
R:   Wow.  
L:   Yeah.  And she has experienced her wild side this year.
R:   Oh.  My mom went --
L:   She's like --
R:   -- through that with me and I was a sophomore it started.  
L:   Yeah?  
R:   Yeah.
L:   I'm glad to see you got out of it.  But still there's a hope.  [LAUGH].
R:   [LAUGH].  It's -- you get bored of it after a while.  Like, I got bored with it.  It ends.  [LAUGH].
L:   I hope so.
R:   [LAUGH].  Is it your first child, this senior?
L:   Yeah.  
R:   Oh.
L:   I had her when I was seventeen, so --
R:   Wow.  My mom --
L:   [MN].
R:   -- had -- no, go ahead.
L:   Yeah, go on?
R:   My mom had me when she was twenty and she had my brother when she was sixteen.
L:   Wow.
R:   So we kinda grew up with her.  [LAUGH].
L:   Yeah.  That's what I did.  I --
R:   I'd like to do that.  
L:   I thought it was --
R:   It'd be --
L:   -- better because I think I was a better parent.  
R:   'Cause you -- you had a more -- 'cause you knew what you -- what -- from your mom, how your mom raised you, you had more of an experience of that.  Because like you knew what to do and what not to do, from like -- I don't know if you baby sat, but babysitting helps a lot.
L:   Oh, I did, and my mom had five kids, me being the oldest.  
R:   Oh, man.
L:   So -- yeah.
R:   Yeah, I have three younger siblings.  I baby sit all the time.  My friends are always telling me I'm gonna be a really good parent.  I don't know why.
L:   I know -- [LAUGH].  You will be.  And a funny thing is as soon as I left my mom and dad's house and got married, I was pregnant a year later.  
R:   Wow.
L:   So I have not been --
R:   So you -- you --
L:   -- with a baby at -- [LAUGH].
R:   [LAUGH].  [MN].  I just wanna -- I just wanna get out of my house.  I guess it's just like 'cause all my friends are like that, too.  I guess it's just something with age, but my parents are weird.  They're weird.  Like --
L:   [LAUGH].
R:   -- you don't understand.  They are weird.  
L:   I'm sure my daughter thinks we are, too.
R:   [LAUGH].  Well, my dad's also -- he didn't have me until he was thirty three and my mom was twenty.
L:   Wow.
R:   So there's the -- well, I'm my parents' only child --
L:   Yeah.
R:   Between my two parents --
