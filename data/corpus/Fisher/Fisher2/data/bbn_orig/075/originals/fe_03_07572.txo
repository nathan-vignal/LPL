L:  Hello.  My name's Cassania.
R:  Hi.  I'm Pat.
L:  Hi.  How are you?
R:  I'm okay.  I'm Pattie.
L:  Hi, Pattie.  So, how many hours of sports do you like to watch a week?
R:  Oh, especially on Sunday I like watching Nascar racing.
L:  Oh.  That sounds fun, along with diving and skating and skiing and --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- golf.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I probably do ten hours a week or more.  Between ten and twelve.  How many do you do?
R:  Uh, probably about six.
L:  Oh, a lot less than me.
R:  [LAUGH]. 
L:  I like sports.
R:  Oh.
L:  I do.  They get paid a lot of money to do what they do.
R:  Yeah.  My hu-
L:  Yeah.
R:  My husband and me, when football season, we watch football games.
L:  Right on.  Football.  Oh.  Oh, my God, especially when they're going for the goal.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Oh, my God.  I love it --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- when they get that touchdown.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, that's so exciting, when they get to six or seven points, you know?
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  Yeah.  I like that.
R:  And then I like the uh skating that they have on there, too.
L:  Oh, my --
R:  When they're going for the medals and stuff, the Olympic.
L:  Oh, I've recorded some of that.  I'm telling ya.  I love it, too.  I think it's incredible, you know, that you -- you got really strong ankles in order to do something like that.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  You have to be real strong.  It's wonderful.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  So you only do six hours a week, huh?
R:  Well, it just depends what season it is.  Sometimes maybe more, you know?  You know, like the football season and --
L:  Yeah.  Do you pop popcorn while you're doing it?
R:  No.  I can't have popcorn.  [LAUGH].
L:  You can't?
R:  I've got bowel reticulitis.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, that -- that's dangerous.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So --
R:  I love popcorn, but can't have it.  
L:  Then I guess you can have juice or something while you're --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- watching?  I like uh -- I like golf.  I like golf and I like to watch bowling, the bowling tournaments that they --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- have, too.  That's really hard to get all the -- the pins down.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  You know, especially when there's one pin there.  I just wonder how they put that spin on --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- getting that last pin down.
R:  And sometimes I catch, when they're having pool games on TV --
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- I like to watch pool.
L:  Oh, my God.  That's incredible, when they can make those double hit shots.  You know, where they can get --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- two balls in at one shot?  And then the college ball, which is incredible.
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  I think it's ha- takes a lot of imagination in order to get that.
R:  Oh.
L:  And lots of luck.
R:  They make it look so easy, too.
L:  Yeah, they do.  Like, Minnesota Sox.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  And that's what I think about when I see that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's incredible.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  So what other sports do you like?  Do you like wrestling?
R:  Oh, yeah some.  Not a whole lot.  [LAUGH].
L:  You don't watch -- what do you call it?  The Rock?
R:  Yeah.  I've seen it.
L:  Oh, he is so cute.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  He's like that candy buck, you know?
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Like the candy buck, gotta give you the smack down.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Sometimes he comes out scabbed[?] a little bit.
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  But he knows what he's doing.
R:  Ah.
L:  Yeah.  I hear he -- he likes to splurge once a week on a dozen donuts.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  He'll eat by himself.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I just can't believe he's in such -- I mean, he looks so strong and so healthy.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  You know?  But, I don't know, I think a lot of sports people are very healthy, very strong, very conscious about their health.  And um I like it.  I just like it.  You like football?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And baseball?
R:  Oh, some baseball.  Depends what teams is playing and the -- I watch it sometimes.
L:  I like it, too.  And hockey.  Do you ever watch hockey?
R:  No.  [LAUGH].  
L:  How about, uh, kickball or kick soccer?
R:  Oh, sometimes.
L:  Mm.  I like it, too.  I like it a lot.  It's all good.  I like the ice sports, you know?  Skiing --
R:  We watch a lot of drag racing, too.  My husband likes drag racing.
L:  Oh, my God.  Does he ever -- does he have a drag car?  Does he ever get out there and --
R:  No, we go -- we go speed all the time.
L:  You do?
R:  Uh-huh.  And we also have a race track here where we live, too, that has sprint cars and stuff like that in it.  
L:  Oh, cool, Pattie.  Oh, my God.  Do you guys ever go racing once in a blue moon?
R:  Mm.  Well, we just go watch it, but we don't have no racecars or anything like that.
L:  You don't?
R:  My cousin does.  Now, he races.
L:  Oh, my God.  Do you ever go when he goes?
R:  Oh, yeah.  
L:  And does he win?
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah. 
L:  So what do -- what do they win when they just do it for fun?  They're not gambling illegally when they're doing it, right?
R:  No.  No.  They --
L:  They're just --
R:  They can win anywhere from like two fifty to five hundred.
L:  Right on.  That's worth it.  That's worth it.  It's like when you're cranking it up and you're going real fast around that track.
R:  Matter of fact --
L:  And --
R:  -- I was -- I am a distant cousin of Daryl Earnhardt.
L:  Oh, my God.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, my God.  Do you ever get his autograph?  Do you ever write to him?
R:  Well, you know, he -- Daryl, you know, he got killed, but his son --
L:  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  He did.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But you do have pictures of him?
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Oh, my God.  That's terrible when he died.
R:  Oh, I know.  I just did not believe it.
L:  Oh, my God.  And he's so young.  I -- I think he was, what, about forty two?
R:  Forty three, I believe it was.
L:  Yeah, he's a baby.  He was just a baby.  And did --
R:  Right.
L:  -- he have little children?  I forgot the -- does he have any children?
R:  Well, they're all grown, you know?  Not no young -- young ones.
L:  That's a blessing, to have children.  Because at least we can love them, you know?
R:  Oh, yeah.  
L:  Through him, and he's not going to be around to be a grandfather.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But he'll be an angel on someone's shoulder.  You -- you got pictures of him at home?  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So there, you're gonna get them blown up and put them in frames?
R:  Oh, I've got gobs of pictures.  [LAUGH] and you know, little cars and you know, collection things and stuff.
L:  Oh.  I'm so sorry --
R:  And I've got --
L:  -- that he passed away.
R:  I've got a corn collection of all the race -- Nascar racecar drivers and stuff like that.
L:  Oh, my God.  You must be like a hardcore collector?
R:  Yes.  [LAUGH].  Yes.
L:  My goodness.  That is gonna go up in value, you know, if you ever want to make money you could sell it on eBay.  
R:  Oh, I ain't got nothing compared to my uncle.  He owns a barbecue place and -- here where we live and he has a room and that's full of the Nascar stuff, you know?
L:  Oh, wow.  
R:  And --
L:  Does he put them in display cases?
R:  Oh, yeah.  Uh-huh.
L:  And he has them framed and up on the wall?  
R:  Oh --
L:  I hope he has it welded --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- into the walls.
R:  I mean, he's got --
L:  Because --
R:  The room is big and it ain't nothing but Nascar stuff.
L:  Yeah, 'cause if you don't weld it into the wall --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- somebody might walk out with it.
R:  Oh.
L:  Somebody might say, "Hey, I like this".
R:  [LAUGH].  So --
L:  You have to --
R:  -- where are you from?
L:  Seattle.  Seattle, Washington.
R:  Cool.
L:  Which --
R:  I'm from Missouri.  
L:  Missouri?  Oh, my God.  I bet it's so hot out there?
R:  Oh, yes.  We're --
L:  I --
R:  -- about um, ninety five today.
L:  How -- how much?
R:  Ninety five.
L:  Jeepers creepers.  I'm lucky, it's only seventy nine degrees here.
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  I'm very lucky.
R:  We're due for some bad storms, too, this afternoon.  They're calling for.  
L:  Oh, that's good.  Everything can get watered down real nice.
R:  Oh --
L:  You know?
R:  -- I don't know.  We live in tornado alley, though.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, my God.  So you guys got the tornadoes?
R:  Mhm.  
L:  That's scary.  That's really --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- scary.  
R:  Yes, yes, yes.
L:  I'd hate to be in that situation.
R:  Uh.
L:  But you love the -- the -- the heat.
R:  [LAUGH].  Well --
L:  The heat --
R:  -- I used to like it more, but I don't like it too much now because I'm taking chemo and it don't do very good with me.
L:  Oh, you poor baby.  
R:  Well --
L:  You -- you losing your hair?
R:  Some.  I'll -- I take the chemo pills right now.  And when I wash it, it's the worse, you know?  A lot comes out then, but they said that I wouldn't completely go bald, supposedly with this, but I've washed a lot.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, my God.  So you have to take vitamins and minerals to get well, because you know, sometimes you could be nauseous when you're watching the -- um, the sports at the same time, you know?  You might get sick and go vomit and then miss something.
R:  Yeah.  Uh, I take sickness pills.
L:  Mm.  Is it --
R:  I have bone marrow cancer.
L:  Oh, that's very dangerous.
R:  So --
L:  Do you have to have amputation donor in order to save your life?
R:  Well, he told me that um I'd be on chemo the rest of my life unless we try for the bone marrow transplant.
L:  Oh.  I wonder, did you sign up for the program?
R:  I haven't yet.  Right now he's saying that he wants to wait a while because of my body rejecting the transplant, the odds is not that great.  He said that he don't like to put you down to do the bone marrow transplant until you're either gonna make it or not gonna make it. 
L:  Oh, no. 
R:  So --
L:  That's terrible.
R:  Because --
L:  That's --
R:  -- he said right now, it's only like a thirty percent chance which ain't very good.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, my God.  Do you have any children that you were blessed with?
R:  I've gone one.  She's twenty one.  
L:  And is she in college or --
R:  Yeah.  She's going to the Orion.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Mhm.
L:  How old are you?  About forty?
R:  Yeah, I'm forty.  
L:  Oh, and you got that one blessing, daughter.  Thank God.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Thank god you had a ch-
