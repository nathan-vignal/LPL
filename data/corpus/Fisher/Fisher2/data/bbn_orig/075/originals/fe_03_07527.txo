R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.  I'm Jeannie.
L:  Hi.  I'm Lauren.
R:  Lauren?  Hello, Lauren.
L:  [MN]
R:  What a -- what a ex- -- ah, what do I wanna say, stressful topic to speak of today, huh?
L:  Yeah.  I almost didn't wanna --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- take it but I thought --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- ah, you know, [MN] I'm moving and my phone is going to be disconnected soon and I just have to finish these up --
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  -- so [MN] um ...
R:  Yeah, I -- I did the same thing.  I felt [COUGH] very hesitant because it's so close to home and I almost feel like the opportunity to protect ourselves has gone -- has passed and we need to, you know --
L:  Mm.  Yeah.
R:  Um, but, um, how are you -- how do you feel, what do you feel that we could do to prevent future --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- terrorism --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- in this -- of this sort?
L:  Ah, I don't know.  I mean, there's so many different ways.  There's so many different factors to this question, you know.
R:  I -- yes, it's a very deep question, and far to deep to discuss [MN] -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- with a lot of knowledge in -- in ten minutes.
L:  Right. [MN]
R:  [MN]
L:  Well, one of my friends, um, I'm in Arizona --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and one of my friends worked at, um, a laboratory in Northern Arizona that studied anthrax --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and I think that knowledge in general is going to be very useful, scientific knowledge --
R:  I agree.
L:  -- so that, um, I think if it's a bi- -- I mean, if it's a chemical attack with a chemical weapon then there should be, um, just to act as a base of counteract[?], you know, there should be some kind of --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- um, chemical solution and -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- I think that science would be a good way to go about --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I don't know, like ...
R:  But it should be -- we should have it now.  We should not --
L:  Right.
R:  -- have it when we -- when we suspect --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- or when it's already a threat.
L:  [MN] Right.
R:  We should -- we should be -- receive immunity of some sort or knowledge of how to immune ourselves --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- prior to any kind.  That's how I feel.  I -- I was participating in the media for many years, involved in media, and I felt with all that has happened that sometimes I feel the media has been almost our worst enemy.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.  Yeah.
R:  O- only --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because they, only because of the things they spoke of ended up happening and, ah --
L:  Mm, interesting.
R:  -- y- you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah, with -- with the, um, with the anthrax --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's once they were telling how it was -- could be -- what -- when they started talking about it then that's when we started becoming exposed to it [MN] --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- and I know there are media hungry people or [MN] this -- th- this situation we're in with these for- -- these third world countries want attention to them so, anyway, so anything that draws attention to 'em I think they're going to attempt --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- anyway to, um --
L:  And the anthrax was within our country too.  I mean, it's just a way --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to get drama and -- and -- and, like, um, [LIPSMACK] what's the word, fame and glory, and it's just very sad, yeah. 
R:  That -- right.  It brought attention to them because I mean if these people are walking into, um, places with bombs strapped to them and -- and sacrificing themselves for attention [MN] just being copycats and doing this other with anthrax and -- and I also believe that many of it is coming from our people that have lived here within our country for many years.  I mean, even the terrorists that did attack [MN] on nine eleven were -- were living here in our country by --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- our request. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, well, they had to know, I mean, it's not exactly like it was easy to get done.  They had to have a lot of insider information --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, and they had to -- it was so well planned that their -- I mean, and that wasn't, of course, that wasn't bio but --
R:  No.
L:  -- um, yet you have to know --
R:  With their knowledge of being able to do it and their freedom to be able to do it, their freedom for those two pilots, ah, the two students to go and sit in the planes [MN] with --
L:  Yeah, that was just ridiculous. [LAUGH]
R:  And then -- and then the saddest think for us, I felt the media should not have let us know this but for them to then receive their, ah, certificates and such after they had been killed doing what they did, I just --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- felt like that only made us look stupid. [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]
R:  But, ah, but the -- the bio, um, the bio warfare is very frightening 'cause --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it -- it spreads so quickly and I -- I, um, I know many -- my children were in the generation they stopped the +smallpox -- smallpox vaccines --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, ah, two of my children have -- have been, ah -- have had the vaccine and two have not --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and, um, I -- that has always been a fear to me.
L:  Mm.
R:  Presently I live in Tennessee but I am from California and I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- remember many years ago they did have, um, smallpox, ah, in the Appalachians here and -- and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it was very frightening to think that at that time and age man was walking on the moon but they didn't have a cure for this. [MN]
L:  [MN] I know.  There are so many arguments alike --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of that.  Like, one of, um, I- I'm interested in, um, breast cancer campaigns --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, that's another one of those things that's, yeah, we put men on the moon but, you know, women are down here dying from breast cancer and [MN] --
R:  I -- I agree.  I agree.
L:  Oh, it's definitely -- yeah, th- the focus on -- on medical development is just not what it needs to be, I think.  Um, I know -- I mean, I like the passage of the new focus on AIDS research but, in general, I think that, um, that --
R:  Prevention.
L:  -- cancer and so many other, like, tuberculosis and people are still dying from influenza and there's just so much --
R:  And, like you said, and tuberculosis.  That was something that they felt ha -- was gone and it has --
L:  Right.
R:  -- come back --
L:  I know, I know.
R:  -- and in some ways we're -- I mean, the bioterrorism is -- is something we need to fear but we also need to fear our know- -- like you said, lack of knowledge and lack of taking care of ourselves here --
L:  Mhm.  Right.
R:  -- just within ourselves.
L:  Sure.  Yeah, and, w- -- our c- -- I mean, our government's probably developing bioterrorism weapons too to use elsewhere but if they're within our country that's kind of scary, you know, that there's the potential there for someone in the wrong hands to use it and --
R:  I agree.  I agree.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think that, ah, sometimes I feel the decision making [MN] I -- all the time I feel some of our decisions that affect the rest of our lives are being made by people who are not [MN] making it a prior- priority to know --
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  -- and how to best take care of it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and um, and I think those decisions should be made by the votes of the people --
L:  I know. [MN]
R:  -- and the decision of the people --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- [MN] just like what you're saying about the anthrax.  Now, they don't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- have enough vaccine for everyone, do they?
L:  [MN] No, and they are g- -- I mean, they're saying they were prescribing Cipro for a while which is that really strong antibiotic --
R:  Antibiotic, correct.
L:  -- but then they were saying, "Okay, wait, slow down.  Don't go out there and just get it just to be sure because we don't have enough". [LAUGH] I mean, how do you, I don't know how you run out of chemical things.  It's -- it just seems like they're made in laboratories and you should be able to make them if it's gonna save people's lives, you know.
R:  That -- th- they should have a surplus and we should all have it -- we should all have it --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- ah, beforehand.  I agree.  [MN] I agree. 
L:  [LAUGH] I know, it's silly.
R:  [MN] I mean, it's -- it's -- it's very frightening to think that, um, that, like I said, we can put men on the moon but -- and -- and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- see, to me, we shouldn't even be worried about outer space.  We need to take of our earth. [LAUGH]
L:  I know. [LAUGH] Yeah, mhm.
R:  No- not only -- not only the -- the ills of our earth but the -- the growing and protecting -- the growing of the food and the protecting of the children --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and the elderly and -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and all of the things that we -- don't seem that are important --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- and -- and, like you said, with cancer, you know, breast cancer, I -- I -- I -- my heart jumped because my mother did pass away of breast cancer but [MN] there's so many things they've said that could have cured it or we could have prevented --
L:  I know.
R:  -- it years ago.
L:  Mhm.  Exactly, exactly. [MN]
R:  And, ah, and we're not.
L:  And if they're testing, I mean a lot of these weapons, not necessarily biological weapons, but they're all based on radiation and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, of course, like, that's why, you know, after Hiroshima there's so much horrible disease in Japan and then it's just -- ah, these things have such long term effects and that's what's really scary, um ...
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  [MN]
L:  And then, like, and -- and that kind of leads to, like, you've mentioned briefly, um, the -- like our food and our crops --
R:  Right.
L:  Like, what would happen to our crops if, like, a -- a one -- one bio- -- you know, biologically based weapon was released over, you know, Illinois, or something, like --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- it would just be --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- oh, catastrophic.
R:  Yes, or, yeah, I unders- -- I agree.  And then we don't, ah, I mean, we've already found what putting -- dumping things into the ground has done and, ah --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it wasn't mean to be terrorism.  They were just -- thought they --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
R:  -- make it go away.
L:  Right. [MN] Right.
R:  You know, I don't know. [MN]
L:  I know, yeah.
R:  And it's --
L:  And the landfills and --
R:  -- we're our own worst enemies --
L:  -- everything.
R:  -- aren't we?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] But, I --
L:  And, like, that's, like, goes back to education again, right?
R:  Yes.
L:  And just research and things. [MN]
R:  Yes, and the knowledge, and I thought with my children's generation that -- that -- because my generation came from the hippy and the -- and the wanting to open up and being more aware of things and I really thought [MN] that my children's generation which, ah, you're probably in, would --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- would -- would be able to take control but instead we followed the same path in politics that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, Vietnam and --
L:  I know, yeah, it's very cyclic.
R:  -- yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And Desert Storm.  There was things done there that were not made aware until afterwards and --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- and -- and which is continuing on.  I, um -- I just felt that the United States was more capable of protecting us and protecting the people they want to protect than --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- what they have followed through doing.
L:  Yeah.  I think a lot of people are starting to feel that actually.  Sort of a growing -- ah, with awareness comes that feeling, [MN] you know.
R:  Right, or --
L:  [MN] The more you're duped the more it's, you know, sort of annoying and scary, um ...
R:  And, yes, an- and I, um, I agree.  I think that we're gonna have to really, really pay more attention, not so much as give media the power but use the media to make everyone aware of what we need to do.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- and, ah, and it goes back to in our homes we have to take care of our homes, take -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because no one else is going to really take care of us.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We've got to take care of our homes.
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's hard with the media because, you know, do they really care about us?  Aren't they -- I mean it's all about entertainment value and the idea of, okay, let's be responsible, let's do, you know, things that are -- that are not so entertaining, like that's -- that's the hard sell I think, um --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- on -- on media -- media.
R:  Well, like, coming from media, the -- it is to let people know to be honest and not hide secrets, to let them know, but I think almost by not having, by being too, letting them know everything, we're telling the people here --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- what --
