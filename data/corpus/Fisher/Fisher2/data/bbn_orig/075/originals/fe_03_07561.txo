L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hi, there.  I'm Shelley.
L:  Uh, what's your name?
R:  Shelley.
L:  Shelley, hi.  Uh, this is Gene.
R:  Hi.
L:  Uh, I'm out here in Los Angeles.  Where are you?
R:  I'm in Seattle.
L:  Oh, hey, that's -- I've heard you've had -- been having very nice weather up there.
R:  Well, yeah, I guess [LAUGH].  It's been --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ninety.  It was --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- ninety last --
L:  Yeah, it's --
R:  -- week.
L:  -- beautiful.  It's better than -- we've been cloudy out here in, uh -- down here [MN] --
R:  I'll swap --
L:  -- in Los --
R:  -- with you.
L:  -- Angeles.  But that's okay --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's -- I -- I enjoy it.  Um, so I guess we just heard the topic, right?
R:  Yeah.  Bioterrorism.
L:  Yeah, wh- an- and was it like, what we could do to prevent it?  Was that what --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the deal was?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah and I --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- don't ...
L:  That's weird.  Uh, what we --
R:  Well, what the --
L:  -- can --
R:  -- government, I guess, could do, to prevent it, um --
L:  Hm. [LIPSMACK] First of all, they could be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- nice -- to nicer nat- -- to the other nations.
R:  [LAUGH] I agree. [LAUGH]
L:  You know and not start wars based on some, uh -- some belief that if we can conquer them, then we're gonna control the world.  Um, you know, um, mm, eh, so, honestly, uh, we -- we -- we need not to be the bully.  We're never supposed to have been the bully.  We're supposed to be the defenders of, uh, freedom.  And you don't do that by invading a sovereign nation, just because we think they have quote, weapons of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- mass destruction, which have never, of course, been found and never will be found.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Since, uh, they don't have -- that -- that's referring to nuclear weapons.
R:  Right, right.
L:  And they -- he just wanted to get rid of Saddam so they could get the oil.  I mean, 'cause Bush is an oil man, okay.
R:  It's painfully --
L:  So --
R:  -- obvious, I agree.
L:  So -- so -- so the reality is that, um, my God, bio terrorism.  Well, bio means life and so, what they're talking about is weapons that might hurt life, which is what they're talking about, is chemical weapons and biological weapons.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, the biggest maker of biological weapons in the world is the United States.
R:  Right.
L:  And we ship it all over the world because it's a m- -- it's a profit making thing.  Uh, in nineteen eighty nine -- nineteen eighty eight -- eight -- the late eighties, we shipped all these chemicals of chemical warfare, to Iraq.
R:  I know.
L:  Because our -- the bad guy at that point wasn't Iraq, it was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Iran and Humeini.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, therefore, we shipped Iraq all these [LIPSMACK] billions of dollars of chemicals and all these chemical companies that do it, most of them are in Texas and friends of the Bush's.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, we sent them all that stuff and then we go invade them this year, saying, "Well, we better get, you know, find all those chemical weapons".
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH] And okay, so the reality is that their weapons are out there, because we make them and then we sell them out there to the other people.
R:  Yeah.
L:  How are we gonna prevent them from getting pissed off at us and using it against us?  Well, you don't invade sovereign coun- countries.  You don't invade a country, especially when the United Nations, which are supposed to be, quote, the world court --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- never said, "Go -- go get the bad guys".  There was --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- no validation to do it.  It -- it was absolutely illegal under international law, what Bush did, to invade Iraq.
R:  Right.
L:  So, therefore, [LAUGH] the topic of conversation, is how do we prevent it?  You stop being the bad guy and pointing their finger over those terrorists over there, when you are the terrorist here, when you go do what you do.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So, that's my opinion, uh, and go ahead, I'll throw the ball in your court.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I agree with everything you've said, um --
L:  Good.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] and I -- yeah, the way that they supported the Iraqi regime when the, um -- when the Iraq and Iran war was happening --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, when they annexed Kuwait, um [NOISE] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- yeah, they're -- I don't know what's happened to those, um, weapons.  I -- they say they destroyed them and, um -- I don't know, they're not finding any, so they must have, I guess.  I [LAUGH] ...
L:  Well, they may find some but, uh, there's no weapons of mass destruction that Chaney and Bush were saying all along that they have.
R:  Oh, right, right.
L:  And even though the UN inspectors never found anything, or no evidence whatsoever, to say that they had anything of a nuclear programme, unlike North Korea, hello
R:  [NOISE] I know. [LAUGH]
L:  That actually does have one, um, but that's okay.  You know, we're not gonna invade them, uh, but we're gonna -- 'cause they don't have the oil like, uh, Iraq does and, uh, [LAUGH] imagine now controlling Iraq, right and then you're right in the region of all the other Arab States.  So, all the Arab States are gonna have to go.  My gosh, you know, America has a presence over here and we don't like it but here they are, so what are we gonna do?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, behave ourself?  So, what do we do?  Back to bio terrorism [NOISE].  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- there isn't an --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- answer --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- that you and I can do, because we're pretty much helpless, unfortunately.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, even if we vote, uh, the voting machines are all done computerized, which mean, can -- you can change the election and have anyone win that you want.  We --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- know that.  The good old days when they counted by hand, well, you know what?  That was [LAUGH] pretty much controllable but, uh, now when it's all done on the computers, uh, you can change computers.  Anyone knows that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um, therefore, you know, the US Supreme Court could again, elect a President, instead of the people electing.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  The only time in US history the US Supreme Court elected a President, uh, rather than the people [SIGH], so, he's not really, uh, the real President.  I don't care if he took the oath of office, he was not truly, constitutionally elected by us.
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  And therefore, he has really no power, even though he is doing everything as if he does.  And this is what unfortunately, the new world order is, that he's a part of.  I'm glad I can share this with you on the [LAUGH] phone --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- uh, somebody who I've never met in Seattle, because unfortunately, this is the truth.  Bio terrorism, we're coming back to that.  What -- what can you and I do?  I think, you know, breathe as much clean air as possible. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Get your lungs used to, um, you know, breathing as much oxygen as possible, drinking fresh water, getting as much organic good foods you can, um, staying positive, staying healthy, happy and being in touch with our spiritual self.  What else can we do?  Um, play music, have friends, um, [LIPSMACK] you know and think positive thoughts.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] An- [LAUGH] and stay centered.  
R:  [COUGH]
L:  Stay in peace, because, uh, what else can a person do?  Uh, you can't live life in a gas mask and, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, pretend that it's okay.  Um, I don't know if you have any other comments?  Sometimes ten minutes goes faster than you --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- think. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, the thing is [NOISE], they are, um -- [LIPSMACK] they talk about small pox and everything, that's not a very effective way to infiltrate.  Er, I mean, the way it gets dispersed is not very effective.
L:  Right.
R:  And I think what I'd worry about --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- are the uncovered reservoirs where our drinking water is, um --
L:  Well, we got that right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You got that --
R:  And --
L:  -- right.  We have to just -- besides dr- -- er, breathing air, we have to drink the water.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they are controlling more of the water all the time, so, either way you look at it, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, they're controlling what we need as human beings to survive and, uh, yeah, that's a -- that's a tough one [SIGH] and, uh, when they have these things called SARS breakout, you know, they even have a name for it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, like -- oh, which just didn't exist before but all of a sudden it breaks out.  Okay, right, so [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, nineteen seventy eight, AIDS was never -- it didn't exist and it breaks out in eight countries simultaneously.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Without any history.  Just interesting.  Of course, we know these are manmade as well and that's part of the whole [NOISE] deal, of biological weapons.  Um, unfortunately, they're using it against --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- us. [SIGH] So, what can --
R:  Well, it's --
L:  -- we do?  Comes --
R:  It's not --
L:  -- back to --
R:  -- the first --
L:  -- that.
R:  -- time. [LAUGH]
L:  Well no, it's not the first time but we have to, um, [LIPSMACK] really, uh, get as much out of we can, out of life and, uh, stay centered and stay in peace and, um, watch what we drink and eat and wh- -- and what we put in our bodies, we have to watch.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, don't take the government's word for it.  Don't get vaccinations.  You want to know about stopping bio terrorism?  Don't be foolish and get vaccinations for this or for that, or for the flu.  You don't know what they put in the vaccinations.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] The AIDS virus was spread in Africa by the World Health Organization, using small pox.  That's why forty million people have it over there and it's a heterosexual disease because both men and women got vaccinated, right?
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  That's how it got in Africa.  Of course, it's how to eliminate a lot of the blacks.  Uh, [SIGH] so, the reality is, if you're real smart, don't ever get vaccinated, ever.  You don't need it.  It's -- you know, if you have children -- I don't know if you have children, or one day have children, don't be fooled by vaccinating your kids, thinking, "Oh, well, you know, the school district's gonna [SIGH] have one" yeah.  No, don't do that.  Um, [LIPSMACK] so, you know, this is where -- this is where people get sucked in, unfortunately.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, that's what you and I can do about [LAUGH] bio terrorism.  Don't --
R:  Well --
L:  -- believe the government, don't get vaccinated.
R:  What I think is funny about the vaccination part, is that they would never be able to, um, distribute vaccine, even if we wanted it, um --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- in a timely manner because --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- I mean, they're [LAUGH] -- around here they can't even control the traffic lights properly --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- so ... 
L:  -- and I heard ... [LAUGH]
R:  Um --
L:  That's what I heard.
R:  Yeah, so, I can't imagine, um, [LIPSMACK] a widespread distribution of any -- any kind of vaccine, or any kind of bio terrorism masks for protection --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um --
L:  Yeah.  I mean, it's just, you know -- and these terror alerts, what a joke.  They just want to keep people, uh, [LAUGH] scared.
