L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  How're you doing?
R:  I'm good.  How're you doing?
L:  All right.  My name is Francine.  What's yours?
R:  It's Susanna.  I'm from, um the Washington DC area.
L:  I'm from New York.
R:  Okay.  Good.
L:  [MN]
R:  Big cities. [MN]
L:  Right.
R:  Um.
L:  Well, the topic is how [MN] can the US prevent bioterrorism.
R:  Right.
L:  Well, [MN] my opinion, they really can't.
R:  That's exactly what I was gonna say. [MN]
L:  They really can't because if somebody, 'cause, like, all research companies, medical research pharmaceutical --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they have all biochemicals --
R:  Right.
L:  -- all over the country.
R:  And we need them, most of 'em, for --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- for, you know, various testing and whatnot and -- and for medicating people.
L:  Right.  And, like, any disgruntled employee --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or just somebody crazy --
R:  Right.
L:  We have a lot of them --
R:  Right.  Yes, we do.
L:  -- like Sudan, and you know, they got technology over there too that -- where they got it from?  The US.
R:  Right.
L:  [MN] You know --
R:  Yeah, absolutely.
L:  So, like, [MN] ah, remember about ten years ago it happened in Japan in the train stations?
R:  You know, I forgot about that but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah.
L:  They let something out in the train on, um, in Japan m- --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- metro and a lot of people died.
R:  Right.
L:  I think it was about ten years ago, so, it's, you know, it's, like, really can't be prevented especially if it's a airborne biochemical.
R:  Right.
L:  No s- -- no smells, no taste, no nothing.
R:  Ahah.
L:  So, you wouldn't even know it, you know.  'Cause I remember when I was in high school, in junior high school --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- they would spray the, um, [LIPSMACK] not pepper spray but things that w- -- some kind of spray that would make you cough --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- you know, and that might be -- you didn't see nothing else or nothing but you got obviously a teary eye --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and coughing and stuff, you know.
R:  I mean, I -- I guess my -- my thing that would be a prevention, not at all to support George Bush because I don't necessarily approve, especially with all this scandal that's on the news about him, but, um, if we could, like pinpoint, if we have any idea where it is, if we can pinpoint --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- where it's coming from.  I mean, that at least is a start but that's about all I can think of for -- for prevent- -- for prevention.
L:  Okay, I -- I hear what you're saying with the pinpoint but what about the little, the little teenager, the -- the top -- the top nerd in the chemistry's class --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- making bombs and making chemicals on their own, [MN] like, ah, they got on the Internet where they can make a bomb.
R:  Yep.
L:  So, they probably have on the Internet, or they could read a book --
R:  Right, on how to do that.
L:  -- where to get this, you know how you grow mould and all like that --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  So if the child is, you know, the teenager is really smart and, you know, this -- they're doing this for kicks, ah, just to see how it works --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, and -- and so, they can't really pinpoint it.
R:  Well I -- I think that bioterrorism has to be harder than making a bomb because I'd say that the average person wouldn't necessarily know how to put chem- chemicals together, but I could be wrong, I have no idea.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, it seems like that happens a lot less that we ha- -- I mean, we have more bombs going off than we have, you know, chemicals let out --
L:  To that.
R:  -- into water systems and bioterrorism is a lot more scary, don't you think than -- I mean, 'cause that can be in your -- it can be in the air.  It can be in the water you drink.  It can be in any -- I mean, I know after September eleventh we were all -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- really careful about what we --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, drank and, you know.  [MN] Ah, my stepfather works in the State Department and [MN] um, he had known something about bin Laden before then and [MN] -- and he was really dead set on th- the fact that they might -- that might be their next move and, thank God, you know, it's years later, it hasn't really happened but that doesn't mean it wouldn't have, you know.
L:  Right.  And, like, most of the time, like, they say they can't pinpoint it.  They have to look in their own backyard.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They have to look, 'cause, you know, they have to test these -- these, ah, bio- biochemicals on something.  They --
R:  Right.
L:  -- have to a- -- they test it on the animals.  You never know that they might test it on humans.  You know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you gotta lotta, you know, areas like in New York City, [MN] --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- they -- the topic of the, um, [LIPSMACK] of the news now [LIPSMACK] is waste plants.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, not toxic waste, just garbage dumps in certain areas and these certain areas is a highway to cancer, is a highway to asthma, you know, so, like -- like it's the garbage and toxic waste and they know what's in these things but they're not doing nothing about it.  They're regulating but, you know, if you p- pay people under the table you can dump your garbage anywhere --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- even toxic waste and what they were doing that before they cleaned up, like, ah, like they got Jamaica babes and queens, you know, Coney Island beach, a lot of the beaches are dirty in --
R:  Right.
L:  -- New York City.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, because they, [MN] you know, all the factories and they dumping all their garbage --
R:  Right. [MN]
L:  -- and then one time they didn't want you to e- -- the- -- well, they didn't want you to fish because the fish had some kind of levels of iodine or something in it, you know --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- because the water was dirty.
R:  Right.
L:  And -- and -- and if they gonna pinpoint something they have to pinpoint th- -- ourselves.
R:  Right.
L:  Because you're letting these companies in the United States do it too.  It --
R:  That's definitely a good point.
L:  [LIPSMACK] And, you know, like, they have lot of things like in the Bronx where a lot of the k- -- children have asthma.  You know, there's certain chemicals in the air, certain, you know, like, factories and stuff and that right there, you know, that's what I'm saying because if you, like you said, [COUGH] excuse me.
R:  Ahah.
L:  [MN] A -- a -- teenager won't be able to do it but if you're a chemistry major you could do anything.  They make drugs and -- and -- and you can make drugs in your kitchen.
R:  Right.
L:  Like ecstasy and all like that.  Most of the drug dealers, they're chemists and they know how to put all that stuff together.
R:  Right, right.
L:  You know.
R:  That's a good point.  I mean, I hadn't really thought about it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in the chemistry sense but, um, you probably have educated people doing it, so --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- it's -- I guess that's what I mean with the bioterrorism versus, like, bombing and -- and, um, that sort of terrorism because I think that, unlike flying planes into [MN] --
L:  I look at it as, right, the coward's way out.  If, you know, I'm not for the, any type of terrorist --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- any type of killing.
R:  Right.
L:  But if you gonna do something, do it where you would know, y- -- it's like being sneaky.  Nobody knows what you doing.
R:  Right.
L:  And you will never get caught because they might not -- can't trace it back to this person.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, with the [inaudible], 'cause, like you said, they could put it in the drinking water.  
R:  Right.
R:  They -- there was a time when [MN] they was, um, [LIPSMACK] injecting something in su- -- in bottles of liquid, plastic bottles, you know, putting --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it in, ah, in the supermarkets. 
R:  Ahah.
L:  You -- you never know and this person who did it, what was he putting it in?  I think he was putting it in juice or milk, something like that, and then they found out there was a needle point in it.
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  Even baby food.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you never know and these people, these, ah, well, these supposed to be normal --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- people that, you know, you going in the supermarket [MN] and you injecting something in -- in a -- in a plastic bottle that, you know, anybody's gonna eat --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, just to be killing people.  You know, they like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to get kicks out of it.  So, you know, if people could do that, [MN] other countries can do it also and it could be either one person, 'cause that's all it takes, like the -- the killing in, um, Israel where that guy, he got -- was dressed as a rabbi --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and he got on the, um, on the bus and blew the bus up.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, that was so sad, you know but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they're known for bombs.  They not gonna do it quietly.
R:  Right, right.
L:  I guess when the pressure gets too much, and I thought the pressure was enough for them to stop, they're still not stopping.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, but if, I guess, they really want to do something to, like, to make a point --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] they will do something like with biochem.
R:  Well, if you think about it though, bioterrorism is sort of, um, less.  Ah, you're right --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- it's not, it's sort of a cowardly way of doing it [MN] but it's also so, [MN] like, difficult to detect --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- which is why I think it scares people so much and also it's, um, it's something that if you're trying to make a point --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it- it's definitely not as -- as, um, big of a point if you're not ever discovered.  Like, if they --
L:  Right.
R:  -- don't know who's doing it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And things like the, you know, the twin towers going down, that couldn't have been ... I mean, we would have always figured out or definitely figured out who that was even if they had never fessed up to it.
L:  Yes.  That -- well, it seemed --
R:  Just 'cause it was such a big thing.
L:  Well, they had, like, like, pieces to a puzzle.
R:  Right, right, right.  But, I think --
L:  They had pieces to a puzzle with that.
R:  -- bioterrorism might not be able to be like that because if they're good enough chemists they wouldn't have to --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- be traced back.  And if it's one person, you know, which is really scary but I think it's -- it's definitely not as common and it's definitely not as, um, useful to most psychos because if -- if -- or psychopathic people, like, is -- that's what their point is.
L:  Ahah.
R:  They usually want the recognition.
L:  Right, that is true.
R:  Unless they really wanna kill people and they don't care if anybody knows who did it.
L:  But some- -- you know, sometime I think about, [MN] like, if the cancer rate is so high --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- asthma, other ailments and stuff, how do you know it's not -- doesn't have a high rate?  You don't know, like, anybody could come anywhere in the United States, anywhere in third world countries --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and just put anything down and, like, you know, most [LIPSMACK] biochemicals, they get immune --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they go stronger, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- th- -- you know, it has a different strain and it gets keeping worse and worse and you never know because there's a lotta, if you look around the United States, a lotta breast cancer.
R:  Right.
L:  How do we know it's not in our food or, you know, ah, like the chemicals that they spray for the bugs and stuff?
R:  That's a very interesting point.
L:  You know.  Like, y- you know, like people think, like, people in the world they -- they don't think of short term goals.  They think of long term goals.
R:  Right.
L:  They gonna think of that next year in the racing[?].  We need somebody like Trump.  He -- when he's building all the -- [MN] his father, Trump, you know, achieved his goal for his sons.
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and Donald Trump Junior is -- is achieving his goals for his kids.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, they l -- think twenty, forty years a- --
