R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  
L:  Do we have to talk about sports on T.V.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  That's too bad, because I'm not -- I don't really know about sports on T.V.  Do you?
L:  No.  I was hoping, like, for a reality T.V. show one or something, or something [LAUGH] like that.
R:  I know.  
L:  Oh.
R:  Um.  Hm.  
L:  Okay.  Sports on T.V.  Hm.  Let's see.  Well --
R:  I think they're obnoxious and monopolize time --
L:  You know what?
R:  -- and money.
L:  Their commercials are really good.
R:  Yeah, they can be funny.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You're right.
L:  Super Bowl commercials are okay.  And the halftime show for the Super Bowl is [LAUGH] usually pretty good.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.  I've seen some pretty crazy ones.
L:  [LAUGH].  
R:  The only thing I keep thinking wha- of, though, is that one awful commercial, that's like those two, like busty [inaudible] beating each other up over, like, a bottle -- Bud Lite. 
L:  Yeah, that's -- yeah.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
R:  And that's always coming in my mind, and that one where, like, somebody's dancing with a vacuum cleaner and just like [MN].
L:  Well, have you no- okay.  What kills me about those Super Bowl ones is during halftime, how -- and I don't know if they did it last -- this year, but last year they had a thing, it was, like, Playboy or Playmates do Fear Factor during halftime because they wanted the people to switch over to that.  I'm thinking, okay, I'm not a guy.  I don't think I [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Like, women, like that's here, you know?  Why is trying to be so alienating?  You know what I mean?
L:  What -- I know.  This is a hard topic.  It's worth ten dollars, though.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Seriously.
L:  I was, like, whoo hoo, they called.
R:  I know.  I'm like, finally.
L:  I know.  Me too [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  That's hysterical.
R:  Yeah.  But I seriously don't watch any sports on -- I had some friends that was obsessed with like the extreme sports.  That was --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- supposed to be, like you know, different, it's supposedly not like as openly --
L:  Right.
R:  -- sexist or whatever, but I -- I mean, they weren't -- they weren't too bad.  But they still were pretty, you know --
L:  Oh, that's funny.
R:  -- domineered.  
L:  We have -- we've got a pretty good college football team here and when they were really super good, I used to watch them every Saturday, but they're not good any more --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- so [LAUGH] it's like, no.
R:  Where are you from?
L:  I live in Nebraska.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.  It's --
R:  I live in Akron, Ohio, and right now the whole thing is, like, Lebron[?] Jeans[?].  I don't know if you've ever heard of that person?
L:  Huh-uh.
R:  Oh, yeah.  He's just this, like, kid from uh -- from school and he's you know, eighteen, and he's like, "I'm foregoing college and getting paid nine million dollars to join -- -" 
L:  Really?
R:  "-- some thing", and it's like this big -- and there's like, seriously, all these Adidas billboards all over the city.  Like, kind of [inaudible] because he joined the Nike, and I'm just thinking, this poor kid.
L:  That's odd.
R:  'Cause he already -- 'cause there's, like, people I know in the city and they like, you know, babysat him when he was a kid and someone's sister dated him and you know, that kind of stuff, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- now it's just like, wow, he just bought his friend, like, a Hummer.  Or whatever.
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  One of those [inaudible] things.  
L:  [LAUGH]. 
R:  Yeah.  And I'm like, wow, you're eighteen.  I am just thinking, that's kinda going lead for uh -- dramatic possibly.
L:  That's just sad.  Yeah.  'Cause, I mean, what do you do when you're done?  What if you get hurt?  
R:  Yeah.  Seriously.  Then you just are such a disposable --
L:  That's it.  I mean, I used to live in Washington DC at one -- and the Redskins were so popular there and then when they were done, the pro football players, you wouldn't hear from them again and every now and then you'd hear how, like, one of them bought a car wash and that was, like, the big deal for them. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, didn't have anything else to do.  That's -- that's weird, that somebody could be eighteen and making that much money.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And he bought a Hummer for his friend?  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Already.  
L:  Of course.  He's gonna be on M.T.V. Cribs pretty soon.  [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  And that's just like, wow.  'Cause Akron's not like the most affluent city, so I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  And I can just imagine, like, an eighteen year old, like, getting access to all that.  Like, that is just a scary thing, because I'm just thinking, "Oh", drugs or something and like just partying and --
L:  Well, yeah.
R:  -- like blah, blah, blah.  Which I don't know, I mean, I guess could be fun, but I just feel, like, pe- people won't be responsible and will they come and take advantage of him and blah, blah, blah.
L:  Yeah, uh and especially when, you know, all of a sudden you realize how many friends you supposedly have.
R:  Mm.  Mhm.  
L:  Yeah.  'Cause then they want some of that money too and they wanna live, you know, like you're living.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  No, that's just bad.  So that's the big scandal at Akron?  
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH].  We have --
R:  Akron, Ohio.
L:  We have nothing in Lincoln, Nebraska.
R:  Oh.
L:  It's summer, so nobody's playing anything.
R:  Oh.
L:  See, we have the Huskers.  
R:  Mm.  Nebraska.  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  They're good, but not any more.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And so they hardly get to be on T.V. very much, 'cause you really only get to be on television to play sports when you're good.
R:  Yes.  True.
L:  So they're not, and we don't have any pro teams out here.  The closest to us would be, like, Kansas City.  
R:  Mm.
L:  So that's it.  So people are really obsessive about Nebraska football.  I mean, very --
R:  'Cause all they have to cling to, kind of?
L:  Yeah.  We've got, like, some minor league um hockey and then baseball and, you know, that's kinda fun.  That's like good family stuff to do, but other than that, they've got nothing.  So they [LAUGH] have to cheer for somebody else [LAUGH].
R:  Totally.
L:  And that's what they do.  
R:  Yeah.  I've never -- I've really never done anything.  I went to a baseball game once and that was it.  I'm not like a sports --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- kinda girl at all, unfortunately, but like, we have the Indians, like the Cleveland, all the Cleveland stuff and the Indians.
L:  Oh, yeah.  That's right.
R:  Like that's like to me, though, it's like -- I don't know.  Just the opposite opposite of Indians, 'cause all -- all the time there's these uh, you know, the anti uh Chief Wahoo phase marchers and stuff?
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].  
R:  And, like, the big clashes.  That always happens downtown.
L:  [LAUGH].  
R:  You know?
L:  God, it's funny.
R:  Big clashes of the anti Wahoo and the pro Wahoo forces.  
L:  That's what would happen with um the Redskins.  It was always, well, they have to change your name because that's very, you know, un P.C.
R:  Yeah.
L:  For them to be called Redskins.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I'm thinking, okay.  [LAUGH].  Look at all the other sports, and with their names, too.
R:  Yeah.  Everything.
L:  I don't -- it just -- I can't sit down in front of the T.V. and like turn on sports.  Although I had an ex boyfriend who had a dad who sat there all day long on Saturdays and Sundays and just watched any kind of sports that was on.  Especially golf.  
R:  Yeah.  That is very boring to me.  Like, those are really nothing.  I mean, I don't have an other [inaudible] sport that I've been interested in.
L:  No.
R:  I mean, some stuff I've been really amazed.  Like, I've watched, um like, surfing and stuff.  I don't know if that's really --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- considered a sport, but it's kind of.  Like, you know, comp- competitions and stuff and I'm just, like --
L:  Yeah, one of the more --
R:  -- wow.
L:  -- interesting one -- well, and the Olympics.  I guess those are kind of -- although it's not professional sports, but they're sports.  They always --
R:  Yeah.  I really like to watch the ice skating.  Everyone's like kinda cute there.
L:  Well, yeah, that's right.  [LAUGH].  That's always gym -- gymnastics in the summer.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  I know.
L:  See, now that's something that you can watch.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Skating, gymnastics, you know?   It's a girl thing.
R:  Girly stuff.  Exactly [LAUGH].
L:  Well, right, 'cause what are we supposed [LAUGH] --
R:  I know.  Yeah.
L:  They're better things to watch, they're so --
R:  There -- there are.  I mean, I really have not had a T.V. in, like, eight years.  Just because I --
L:  You're kidding?
R:  -- moved out of my parents' house and like never bought -- never bothered at all.  When the guy -- we had a room mate that had one, but I don't have one, so I seriously never, ever watch T.V.
L:  Wow.  You must have so much time?  I mean, that just must be great.
R:  Yeah.  Sometimes like today, though, I was just sitting around and kind of out- overcast and stuff and I was just kinda then wanted to flip through and just be brainless, so it gets -- like, I'm bored sometimes, but I'm -- but I'm like, you know what?  I want one but then I'm just like, actually, I could just be doing something way cooler right now.
L:  Well, yeah [LAUGH].
R:  Like reading even, you know?
L:  That's right [LAUGH].  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I have a two year old, so --
R:  [MN].
L:  -- we're watching a lot of the Lion King recently.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.  That's basically all -- we cancelled our cable because we never get to watch it because of the Lion King so [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh.  
L:  Yes.  So you see, kinda the same thing.  We could flip through if we wanted to, but, no.
R:  Yeah.  Even just to have one for movies, though, I think would be all right.
L:  Well, yeah, that would be cool 'cause then -- I mean, there's so much out there.
R:  Mhm.  That's what I would like.  Just for like -- for the rainy days, or for the days when you're --
L:  Yeah, when you're not really doing anything.  You're not going out.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  I can see that. 
R:  Mm.  Yeah.  That's good, though, the Lion King.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Nice.  I actually saw that for the first time, like a month ago.
L:  [LAUGH].  We --
R:  So --
L:  We have it summarized now.  [LAUGH].
R:  Cool.  I -- I remember though, like, when it came out in high school, like lots of my friends were really into it.  Like, the guys for some reason.  I don't know why.
L:  It's kinda -- I read the reviews on the back and they were saying, you know, kids like it and people couldn't understand why 'cause they said it's kinda violent.
R:  Uh-huh?
L:  And I guess it is, but I don't know.  It -- I mean, it's kind of cute, it's quite funny.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well like, it's a cartoon. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, it's not like [LAUGH] it's the discovery channel or anything.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, plus what's it supposed to be like?  I mean, they have to realize that, like -- I mean --
L:  They're lions.
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I mean, yeah, they're talking lions, with like --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [inaudible] and stuff, but --
L:  They're singing lions [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  They're fun lions.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But yeah, that's all that we get to watch so there are no sports.  You know, I think even before any of it -- we never -- even my husband --
