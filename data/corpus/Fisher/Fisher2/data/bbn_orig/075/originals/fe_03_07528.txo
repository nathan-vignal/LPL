L:  Hi there.  My name's Nancy.
R:  Hi.  I'm Bob.
L:  Hi Bob.  And, ah, where are you from?
R:  Ah, New Jersey --
L:  New Jer- --
R:  South Jersey.
L:  Okay.  I'm in, ah, Northern Michigan.
R:  Huh.  Well, that's a little bit [LAUGH] -- a little distance.
L:  Ah, just a little.
R:  B- --
L:  But made, ah, ah, close together by our phone call. 
R:  Yeah.  Is this your first time on the phone call or ...?
L:  Um, this is my third conversation I've had and -- but the first time that the conversation has been a little, um, more in detail.  Ah, we'd -- 
R:  Ah, this is the second.
L:  Ah, what I meant by that is we'd ta- -- ah, the other conversations were more about, ah, lighter topics. [PAUSE] So, c- --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Can --
R:  Bioterrorism is a little bit heavy. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.  And the threat is there.  And after --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, you know -- after w- -- ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- nine eleven and how, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- somebody masterminded that who- -- you know, the whole of a- -- y- -- aftermath and -- and I just can't believe still on how he- -- you know -- they were able to do it.  I -- I just can't see anybody p- planning that mass destruction and what effect it had on, you know -- on people with everyday lives.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and now the threat --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of, you know -- we've had the threat of anthrax come through the mail and -- and, um, up here in Canada, um, when I was visiting, um, about the SARS.  I don't know if you've read, ah, r- -- done in any reading on it but it just, um, ah, b- -- just by people visiting from another country and bringing in illness and that was, um, ah -- ah, just, you know, mutated and, you know, killed innocent people just by passing through the airport.
R:  Right.  And then we had the monkey virus --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they found down here.
L:  Yep.  And, um, so it -- it's not just, a- ah, um, m- -- just -- it's just not people but it's animals being brought in and, you know, it was a zookeeper I think or a -- a pet store owner that, ah, brought in, um, some -- some -- some animal -- I can't remember -- was it a monkey that was +infected or ...?  Or -- and, ah, then started infecting the population.  It was that quick.  Ah, one day they're in, you know, their own home climate and the next -- n- next day they're in our pet store.
R:  Now, you think that's bioterrorist or do you think that's just, you know --
L:  Ah, no.  But --
R:  -- bad luck and ...?
L:  -- ah, but it -- if it's that easy to get a monkey in, um, you know, it could be, ah, an innocent person bringing in, um, a suitcase and that suitcase having something in it and just spreading it.
R:  I think it's just amazing, you know, that something hasn't happened before nine eleven.
L:  Mhm.  Well, I think it was -- we were just, you know -- it had happened outside the world, like, in the world all around us.  Um, you know, there's been so, you know -- in, oh -- in Israel and Palestine and all the other countries.  They face this every day.  And it --
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.  That's --
L:  And --
R:  I can't understand why we didn't have it sooner.
L:  And -- and it just took us by surprise that somebody would do that.  Um, I just -- and -- ah, it -- it -- the thought never really passed my mind --
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  -- because we were always so -- I don't know. [LAUGH] You know, we were here.  You know?  We were basically safe.  The world, you know, didn't bo- -- well, we -- you know, we were the defenders not the, um -- the people to -- to destroy an- and do these -- that kind of thing to.  And now it -- it's so easy now with technology and they've s- -- you know, they have the chemical -- of just releasing it very, you know -- just, um -- even in one person.  And that person coughs or whatever and then the virus is spread.
R:  Right.
L:  So -- so easily.  It's almost like that, um, movie that -- ah, who did it have ...?  The Stand or something like that?
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  There's been Outbreak.  There was one too.
L:  Mhm. [PAUSE] So, it -- you know, and then when it's airborne h- -- it passes so quickly.  I -- nobody's immune to it just like, um, you know, when, ah -- ah, you know, the white man came to America and they, you know -- things that n- -- ah, were common to, you know, the European settlers that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, the n- --
R:  Killed the Indians[?].
L:  -- the natives got.  So, it's -- it -- I don't know.  It -- it -- it's just unthinkable now of -- yeah [SIGH] -- of ways that the, um, diabolical idiots can think of -- of -- of hurting someone else, hurting another nation.  And I don't --
R:  What do you think about these yellow alerts and the orange alerts?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Do you think it's saving -- do you think it serves any purpose or think people are just getting so used to 'em ...?
L:  Yep.  It -- it's until something happens.  But what I think should happen is the borders should be more, [COUGH] um, controlled.
R:  Patrolled.  Exactly.
L:  And, um, just not letting everybody through.  And, um, that they have a strict search.  Um, like I would s- -- like to see at the border, um, actually, um, y- you know, not just asked a few questions but to actually go through, um, like a interview and a search before you're allowed in the country.  I don't care who you are.  Um, it's just not safe to let anybody in.  Even, um, you know, ah, eee, when this nine eleven thing came about they were posing as, you know -- as -- as airport pilots and actually, they were in the country.  But how did they get in?  You know?  And so --
R:  If they [several inaudible words] at the borders you know that they check 'em.  But what about all the unpatrolled borders?  They just come across and nobody even sees them.
L:  Yep.  And they came ac- -- you know, and not blaming Canada in any way, they just, you know, slipped across.
R:  It's even worse on the Mexican side.
L:  Yep.  And so, you know, the threat is not from just one nation. It's, you know -- even there is a bunch of crazies right, you know --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- right here in our own states.  And -- well, that's been proven more than once.  I mean if --
R:  M- --
L:  -- um, they could break into, you know, any biological lab and store things.  Or, um, contaminant, um, produce or, um, packaging o- of -- of even vitamins and selling them.  And they can take --
R:  Right.  Remember back when they had the scare of the tampering on the aspirin bottles?
L:  Mhm.  Yep.
R:  Then suddenly everything, you know, had the tamper proof bottles.
L:  Yep.  Before that.  And, um, the same with, like, just anything.  People -- some people are just so warped and you can try and protect yourself and you know -- I don't know.  You just n- -- um, it just -- you can just feel like it's an accident waiting to happen. [PAUSE]
R:  Did you go out and buy duct tape?
L:  Oh, I have duct tape. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Do you really? [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, we use duct tape for everything here. [LAUGH] If it's both[?] --
R:  Well, yeah.  I [LAUGH] -- 
L:  If it's --
R:  I use for everything but --
L:  If --
R:  Did you buy plastic and duct tape specifically to do your windows --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because they warned you?
L:  Yeah, I did.  Um, but actually, even wearing, um, safety precautions of, um -- making sh- -- just washing, more hand washing.  I don't -- I'm not as -- people, um, ah, you know, shaking hands and as, you know -- as friendly as I was before just, um -- I don't know.  It's just brought on a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- whole new, um, concept on the way I feel about, oh, meeting strangers or going somewhere else and -- and, um, to me there's no place like home. [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, I don't know about -- about you but here, people are starting to stop going to Chinese restaurants --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and ordering out Chinese.
L:  Yep.  Because that's where the in- -- you know, the infection --
R:  Right.  There're afraid they're gonna --
L:  -- came and -- and the same with, you know, exotic meals.  Well, you don't know what happens, you know, with -- what's in the kitchen.  Um, and I just prefer to make -- actually make my own meals and -- and so I know where things are coming from, how they've been prepared.  I think more on cleanliness and -- and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, somebody, you know, putting up something in something.  I -- I guess just call it weird or just more, um -- hm, more alert.  I mean, and more, um, safety conscious.  Ah, and -- and the same with my children.  Ah --
R:  Have you heard anything about the spraying?  And the jets putting out the ...
L:  [LIPSMACK] The jet --
R:  What do they call it?
L:  Pesticides of some kind or ...?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or --
R:  When they're criss crossing and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah --
L:  And the same, ah, [COUGH] -- now in, ah, [COUGH] where --
R:  Chemtrails.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Chemtrails.  Is what I can think of.
L:  Yeah.  And where we are, um, because it's coming up to the season for, um, mosquitoes and things of -- for the West Nile virus and, you know, from a mosquito bite and all the precautions you need to take and it's getting, you know, that, ah, um -- you prepare yourself against the sun and now the, um, mosquitoes and everything else.  It's like, pretty soon it won't be safe to, ah, go outside and leave our homes.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well --
R:  It's getting to that point.  I know some of my friends are like this.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They're afraid to go out to -- yeah.  A girl who's afraid to go out to the shopping mall.
L:  Mhm.  I mean, and then, you know, before that, you know, down south where the, you know -- that idiot that was just shooting people th- -- even getting gas.
R:  Oh, right.  Yeah.
L:  So, it -- it y- -- I don't know.  Terror comes in -- in all forms. [PAUSE] But that's my own opinion and -- and the same with the -- the bioterrorists.  Like i- if somebody's gonna do --
