R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.  My name is Jim Hoskins of -- from Oklahoma. [NOISE]
L:  Okay.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  My name's Aida[?].  I'm from Bastrop, Texas. [LAUGH] So, this is a subject that's been on the news recently so ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  The question was what can you do -- what do you think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we can do to prevent bioterrorism?  Is that what it was?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm thinking.  I don't know about preventing it.  Ah --
L:  Is that what the question was?
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Okay.
R:  [NOISE] Or possibly, ah, [NOISE] be prepared. [NOISE] Hang on just a second.
L:  Sure.
R:  Honey, [NOISE] I'm doing a survey.  I'm gonna have to go in here where it's quiet. [NOISE] Ah, [NOISE] I think the government's doing a lot right now to, ah, [NOISE] you know, prepare [NOISE] the alert -- more security at the airports and what have you.
L:  Mhm.  Well, I agree and I don't know -- I've never really thought about what else they can do besides what they're doing right now.  'Cause really, um, the core of the matter is the way people feel about each other.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And you can't change w- -- the way people think.  Maybe that might be one way.  I don't know.  'Cause they seem to hate so much, which I can't understand why.  But then I'm not in their shoes so ...  Not that I'm for whatever they're doing -- I think it's wrong.  But --
R:  Well, I was looking at a book the other day, ah, the title of it is, Why They Hate -- ah, Why They Hate America.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they went into several, ah, discussions.  This book was, kind of, biased in favor of that side of the -- of the viewpoint.
L:  Mhm.
R:  There are -- there are reasons why they do hate America.
L:  Mhm.  Well --
R:  And, you know, w- -- one of 'em is that -- but we seem like we have so much wealth and they don't think that's right.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Jealousy, I guess you could call it.
L:  I guess.  Well, maybe that's one thing they can do to prevent it is to try and treat people on an even keel, ah, you know -- in an even basis where w- we don't think we're better than they are.  Maybe that's why they hate us -- one reason because we might think -- they might think that we -- we're condescending to them, you know?  And --
R:  Well, and also, they're -- anybody that, ah -- they think that anyone that's not Muslim --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is, ah, -- ah, infidel, which is t- -- ah, is another word for evil.
L:  Uh-huh.  Oh, yeah.  Well --
R:  Did they hate us simply because we're not Muslim?
L:  Right.  That's true. [LIPSMACK] And so, y- -- maybe religion has a lot to do with it.
R:  I would think so.  Yeah.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  And I don't know how you can change people's ideas about that. [LAUGH]
R:  No.  That's the way they were brought up.
L:  Yeah.  And being a Christian myself, I don't look at things the way they do so ...
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm a Christian also --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I -- I don't think you should force your religion on anybody or, ah, hate somebody because they're not of your same, ah, you know --
L:  B- -- ah, belief?
R:  Ah, theological --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- w- -- viewpoint or whatever.
L:  Yeah.  Maybe they feel we don't respect their [LIPSMACK] -- their way of thinking.  Maybe that's one reason too they hate us so ... [SIGH] I don't know.  It's a really [LAUGH] -- I mean, I know the solution but, um, it's religious so [LAUGH] I think --
R:  Mhm.
L:  There's -- the governments aren't gonna go for that.
R:  Right.
L:  So --
R:  And it's not all of 'em, it's just the extremists.
L:  Yeah.  That's true.
R:  You know, here in this country there's -- there's groups of thousands of members that just totally hate America.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yet they're -- they're drawing checks, you know? [LAUGH] They're -- they're getting social security, disability, they're living out in the woods.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But they hate their country.
L:  Yeah.  So, why do they come here? [LAUGH] I don't understand.
R:  Yeah.  Well, why are they -- why are they staying?  Well, they're getting a free ride, you know?
L:  I guess so.  Ah --
R:  There's a lotta people like that.
L:  It's a complicated issue and I don't think there's any simple solution to it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, the government is probably doing the best they can.  And --
R:  Oh, I think so.
L:   And not a -- I'm not an expert though.  I couldn't really [LAUGH] tell them what else to do.  But --
R:  We -- we sent our son off, ah, last Tuesday on an airplane to, ah, Ohio.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And my wife took him inside -- I had to stay with the car -- but she said the security was just completely different from the last time that she was in an airport.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  They searched her purse, they made her take off her shoes.
L:  It --
R:  And she wasn't even the one that was getting on the plane.
L:  I was gonna say, she wasn't flying and they made her do all that?
R:  No.  No.  They made her go through all that and she wasn't even the one that was gonna be flying.
L:  Oh.  Was she taking him into where they -- the plane goes?  Is that why?
R:  Yeah.  I guess so.
L:  'Cause I guess that's what it is.
R:  Because she was -- I don't know.  She was past --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a security point or something --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but ...
L:  So --
R:  Definitely was different. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Hm.  I haven't been in an airport in about three years.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I've been flown in an airport -- in an airplane so I don't know but [SIGH] -- I don't know.  I guess we both agree on this -- on the same issue I guess that they're doing just about all they can and I have no new ideas. [LAUGH] I don't know about you?  So --
R:  No.  I can't think of anything new but, ah, something that a lot of people aren't aware of -- did you know that, ah, our government has prevented many attacks?
L:  Uh-huh.  From what I hear --
R:  Did you know that?
L:  -- on the news.  Yeah.  From what I hear on the news on -- it's -- but I don't know if I could always believe what you hear on the news.  Ah --
R:  Well, I heard on -- on, ah -- [NOISE] no, I didn't hear this on TV, I read it in a book.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That, ah, they just barely stopped somebody from setting off a nuclear device.
L:  In this country?
R:  Yes.
L:  Hm.
R:  It came in on a fr- -- on one of those container ships and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they caught it before it got into the country -- before it got unloaded.
L:  Oh.
R:  And it was a live nuclear device.
L:  Oh, eee, oh.
R:  This was only a couple of months ago.
L:  Hm.  It came from what country, do you know?
R:  Ah, it was on a Liberian freighter.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  S- -- but they don't know where it c- -- originated from.  No.
L:  Ah.  Maybe that's another thing they can do is check ships that are coming in more.
R:  Yeah.
L:  For things like that.
R:  Yeah.  Definitely.
L:  Mm.  I don't --
R:  They're -- some of those big ships, ah -- I don't know if you've seen pictures but they have --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, tremendous amounts of -- of stuff on 'em.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Ah, train car size boxes.
L:  I've seen them in New York City's harbor.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  I mean --
L:  I know how big --
R:  -- you could put anything in there. [LAUGH]
L:  They are.  Yeah.  But I -- I mean, the way things are today it -- anybody can just get on one of those ships and put some, kind of, bioterrorist thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's why -- maybe, that's one thing they should do is have more security on those ships that go out at different ports.
R:  Yeah.  Maybe more security where -- where they're being loaded.
L:  Mhm.
R:  To check everything that's going on to 'em.
L:  Mhm.  So --
R:  'Cause if they wanted to they could put some r- -- something real bad on there and then wait 'til the ship is in the har- harbor there and set it off.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I think they probably need to try to check it before it gets on the ship.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, that'd be a scary thought.
L:  It's just beyond my r- realm of thinking how people could do things like this.  I don- -- I don't know.  I just -- I [LAUGH] --
R:  I don't understand it.
L:  I don't understand what -- what kind of r- religion this is of these extremists that, ah -- 
R:  No.  I know.
L:  -- have so much hatred in their heart.  But --
R:  I guess you just have to grow up with it to -- to understand.  D- -- even then I don't --
L:  I don't -- 
R:  I don't get it.
L:  It makes --
R:  How so many people believe like that.
L:  Yeah.  And kids are taught to hate m- -- from young and it --
R:  Oh, yeah.  In --
L:   It's a terrible thing.
R:  In kindergarten. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.  Well, [SIGH] [LAUGH] so that's how they -- that's all they know I guess, from when they're little.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like in Palestine and Israel over there -- I would not want to live there.  I'll tell you. [LAUGH]
R:  No.  No way.
L:  I wouldn't even wanna travel there to visit. [LAUGH] Even though I would like to see what Israel's like but I'd never -- not the way the situation is today.  But -- and though Israelites thought they had things under control for a long time there but the terrorists seem to be taking over there, causing a lot of havoc.
R:  Well, and since you mentioned, ah, Israel, that's another reason they don't -- that the, ah, Muslims hate America because they -- they perceive that we support --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- Israel, which is true. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  They really hate that.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  I think our time's up. [LAUGH] 
L:  No, that's my timer on my stove. [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.  Will they let us know when our time is up?
L:  I guess there must be a little beep or some such thing.  I don't know.  I really don't know what else to tell about -- talk about. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Bioterrorism.  Except --
R:  Well, I'm just pretty happy with the way they're taking care of things now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I feel safe.  I live in a small town, which makes --
