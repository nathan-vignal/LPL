R:  Hi!  [SIGH]  I'm Wendy.
L:  [MN]  I'm Kim.  [SIGH]
R:  Hi, Kim.
L:  Hi!  Nice to -- [NOISE] not meet you but, you know ...  [SIGH] [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Well, w- what's your favorite holiday?  [SIGH]
L:  M- mine, I think has to be Christmas.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, what -- how come?
L:  I don't know, it's just the l- lights, all the -- it's just exciting I think.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
L:  All the decorations, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- preparations and all that.  [SIGH]
R:  [MN]  So, what do you do for Christmas?  [SIGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK]  U- um, the usual celebrations, um, put up the tree, like, two weeks before.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  One of the -- ah, a silly family tradition we have is kids always cut out, um, paper snow flakes and we tape 'em all over the windows [SIGH] and bake for all the neighbors and --
R:  Oh, that's cool.  [SIGH]
L:  Y- yeah.  How about you?  [SIGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK]  U- um, well, hopefully when my family's all together 'cause sometimes we're all in -- [SIGH] all different parts of the country.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-oh.
R:  But h- hopefully we just g- get -- all get together [SIGH] and, um, [LIPSMACK] just [SIGH] open presents and, [SIGH] um, you know, maybe I'll make a gingerbread t- thing or whatever with my little sister and [SIGH] p- pretty much the more family we get together the better because [SIGH] you know --
L:  The more the merrier.
R:  Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  And I guess that's [SIGH] what, you know, makes the -- the holiday real.
L:  Y- yeah, being with family.
R:  Y- yeah.  Especially, like, ... you know, cousins that you hardly ever get to see or anything.
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  [SIGH]  Y- yeah.
L:  The long lost r- relatives.  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  How about -- what's your favorite holiday?
R:  Well, I -- [LIPSMACK] gosh that's a tough question.
L:  It is kind of hard.
R:  I really like Easter [SIGH] just because [SIGH] it's not too stressful.  [SIGH]  Just 'cause it's not, like, all played up too much or, like, you don't have to -- to d- do a whole bunch of stuff and everything.
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  And it falls at such a nice time of the year.  [SIGH]  And it's near my birthday usually.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Even better then.  R- right?
R:  Y- yeah.  And it's like --
L:  It's, like, a super one.  [SIGH]
R:  -- cool.  And it's just like kind of a spirit filled day, you know.
L:  Y- yeah, --
R:  It's just --
L:  -- totally.
R:  -- mellow a- and just time for ... whatever.  You don't have to celebrate it but you can if you want, you know.
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  [SIGH]  [LIPSMACK]  So, but [SIGH] if I could make up a holiday I think I'd make up a holiday, [SIGH] like, called Family and [LAUGH] F- Friends Holiday.  Just 'cause my --
L:  That's [NOISE] cool.  [SIGH]
R:  -- family and friends are everywhere [LAUGH] a- and it's just nice to get everybody together.
L:  Get together.
R:  Uh-hum.  Yeah.  What would you do --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [MN] if you could make up a --
L:  I think --
R:  -- holiday?
L:  -- I don't know what I would call it but just like everybody could have a day off from everything.  [SIGH]
R:  That -- that's sounds good.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  A catch up day.  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  Just like r- relax, you know.
R:  Relax day, yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  Everybody's so busy all the time.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Yeah, that would be a really good one too and where you, like, [SIGH] couldn't -- [SIGH] you couldn't, like, rush and do stuff --
L:  Y- yeah, --
R:  -- like that day.
L:  -- or you didn't even have to.  [LAUGH]
R:  R- right.  [LAUGH]  'Cause [LAUGH] everything would be already taken care of, huh?
L:  Then may be behind the next day but, oh, well, [LAUGH] --
R:  Y- yeah.  That --
L:  -- at least you had one day.
R:  -- wouldn't matter.  [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Because it would be a ca- -- it would be a free day for everybody so --
L:  Yeah.  So, I guess --
R:  -- nobody really be behind.
L:  -- nobody would really be behind.  [SIGH]
R:  Right.  So, [LAUGH] [SIGH] that would be a good day.  [SIGH]
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  A- and, no traffic that day.
L:  N- n- no.
R:  No cars allowed or something like that.  [LAUGH]
L:  Something -- I don't know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Just make everybody relax for a change.
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  Slow down.  [SIGH]
R:  It could be, like, N- Non US Day.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Because, [LAUGH] like, that's our problem in the US is we do that ... way too much.
L:  Oh, I know just go, go, go, go.  [SIGH]
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Just like my goal is to try and learn how to relax [SIGH] and not [LAUGH] --
L:  It's hard when you're not used to it.  But ...
R:  It is.  It is, definitely when you -- you know, you're society pushes you --
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] to do so much.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  But so wh- what -- what are your o- other --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- favorite holidays?
L:  Um, besides C- Christmas being number one, [SIGH] I'd have to s- s- say, [SIGH] -- let's see, what's next?  [LIPSMACK]  Probably Valentine's D- Day.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, yeah, that's a fun one --
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  -- sometimes.  [LAUGH]
L:  Some -- most of the time.  [LAUGH]
R:  Y- yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]  I've been married quite a while and I don't know I still like to just do silly little Valentine's Day t- things and I think it just m- makes it better, keeps it fun.  [SIGH]
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  And so [LIPSMACK] I don't know, I'm silly like that.  Like, all the [LIPSMACK] old fashioned [NOISE] silly stuff.  [LAUGH]
R:  R- right.  That's so cool, though.
L:  [LAUGH]  Y- yes.
R:  Oh, that's so important.
L:  Y- yeah.  [NOISE]  Keeps things --
R:  And, y- you know --
L:  -- fresh.
R:  -- to know that people still c- celebrate [LAUGH] it is really good.
L:  Oh!  [LAUGH]
R:  'Cause some people are really anti --
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  Valentine's Day.  [SIGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK]  I still like it.  I- it probably really is my favorite next to --
R:  [SIGH]  Y- yeah.
L:  Christmas.  [SIGH]
R:  That's cool.  [SIGH]
L:  So, that's good.  What's your next favorite one?  [SIGH]
R:  O- o- oh!  I guess, [LIPSMACK] I'd -- you know, I really liked was Halloween just --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because [MN] as I've gotten older -- or when I was really young I liked it, but now that I'm o- older [SIGH] I like it too because you can just d- dress up and just p- pull it and you're somebody totally different --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- whether you want to be a rock star or just -- [SIGH] and you can c- completely, like, just imagine in your mind and live it out for the day [SIGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and wear whatever you want.  [LAUGH]
L:  Be what you want to be.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  I'm sorry?
L:  Be what you want to be.  [SIGH]
R:  Exactly.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Yeah, and that's does come -- and that's why I like Halloween [NOISE] --
L:  [LAUGH]  That's kind of --
R:  -- just 'cause of that.
L:  -- cool.  [SIGH]
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  Lets you kind of escape.  [SIGH]
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  Lets you kind of escape.  [NOISE]
R:  Well, ye- it's like a- an escape.  Is that what you just said?
L:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
R:  Y- yeah, it is like an escape.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Um, [MN] but, yeah, I still -- I still think F- Family and Friends Day [SIGH] would be the best 'cause --
L:  [NOISE]  I think that's really cool.  [NOISE]
R:  -- I just dream of a day where, like, I have all my best friends together --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- 'cause they live a- all over, --
L:  Everywhere.
R:  -- [SIGH] like, from DC all the way to [SIGH] California.  So, --
L:  Oh, gosh!
R:  -- and [LAUGH] New Orleans and everywhere so ...
L:  Everywhere in between.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  So, that would be my dream [LAUGH] --
L:  That's a -- that would be really --
R:  -- just to have everyone.
L:  -- cool.  [SIGH]
R:  Y- yeah.  And -- and combined with your holiday --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] of, like, [LAUGH] n- nothing to do.  So, we --
L:  Get together and --
R:  -- all get to play.
L:  -- do nothing all day long.  [SIGH]
R:  Right.  'Cause that's why it's so -- it's just really hard on ... [MN] to get everybody together.  I mean that's probably the biggest ... g- gripe --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- of holidays is it's just [SIGH] --
L:  Y- yeah, 'cause nobody has time.  [SIGH]
R:  Y- yeah, exactly.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, ...
L:  [SIGH]  So, those two tie together.  [SIGH]
R:  Right.  So, ah, how do you, um, [LIPSMACK] -- I'm sure you have your own, like, law -- [SIGH] give yourself your own law catch up holidays, ah, here and there, huh?  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, I don't know --
R:  Sometimes?  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I don't get to do as -- d- do too many.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But ...  [SIGH]  [LIPSMACK]  [NOISE]
R:  [MN]  I mean if you can do that that's important.
L:  Ah, y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  It definitely makes it nicer.  Not so stressful.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, maybe you could, like, [SIGH] -- maybe you could s- stick a h- holiday in your calendar.  Like, maybe o- once every month or [SIGH] --
L:  That would be cool.
R:  -- once every few months.  Just --
L:  Highlight a day --
R:  -- just that you would know about it.
L:  -- that you like.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Nobody would know.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's our family holiday.
R:  And, like, on that day you don't answer your cellphone [SIGH] [NOISE] you don't -- you take a sick day off of work if you go to work.  [SIGH]  You just ... a- and you j- just totally act like you're on holiday [LAUGH] that day --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [LAUGH] even if you're the only one --
L:  Wrap up a present --
R:  -- in the country.  [SIGH]
L:  -- and have a barbecue.  [LAUGH]
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Maybe get a few of your friends in on it or something like that.
L:  That would be funny, just like f- for no special occasion, you know.
R:  Y- yeah, you know, that's g- getting me thinking now.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Start a tradition.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, I think I'm going to have to do that with my friends.  I'm gonna [SIGH] -- 'cause we're all so busy too so I'm going to have to force them --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- to have a [LAUGH] h- holiday [SIGH] with me.
L:  We're having a holiday darn it.  [SIGH]
R:  Y- yeah.  I mean in college we used to play hooky all the time, so ...  [LAUGH]
L:  And why not do it in real life, right?  [SIGH]
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  So, ...
L:  That would be really fun.  [SIGH]
R:  Y- yeah.  Well, how about -- do you like, um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] what are -- what about Thanksgiving?  [SIGH]
L:  Y- yeah, Thanksgiving is good but that can get kind of hectic just with, ah, --
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  -- meal and all that.  [SIGH]
R:  Y- yeah, [SIGH] 'cause you have to do ... certain [SIGH] things a certain w- way.
L:  Yep.  Yep.  [SIGH]
R:  And, y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And you have to accommodate everybody when it's --
L:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
R:  -- you know ...  [LAUGH]
L:  So, that one can get kind of hectic, but I like it.  There's really no hol- -- there's not any holidays I don't like, that I totally h- hate.  [NOISE]
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  How about Mardi Gras?  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  You know what --
R:  Do you like Mardi Gras?
L:  -- I've never celebrated Mardi Gras.
R:  You never celebrated --
L:  I think it would --
R:  -- Mardi Gras?
L:  -- be so fun.  I just haven't ever done ... anything really for it.  [SIGH]
R:  [MN]  [SIGH]  Well, it -- it's pretty [SIGH] neat holiday when you're from t- there but then you -- you g- get tired of it too after a while.  [SIGH]
L:  It's like the same old, same old.
R:  And then you want to skip town.  Y- yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  I grew up on t- the west coast so it wasn't really that big of a deal there.  [SIGH]
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  But I always --
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  -- thought it would be c- cool.  [SIGH]
R:  I would make my friends celebrate it 'cause I was the only one from New Orleans [SIGH] and I went to college on the west coast so [SIGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- we'd have Mardi Gras.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And they'd celebrate it for me.  [SIGH]  And we'd --
L:  Well, that's cool --
R:  -- have fun together.
L:  -- it made you feel at home at least.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly.  [LIPSMACK]  But, um, [LIPSMACK] and what else, Fourth of July?  [SIGH]
L:  I like Fourth of July a l- lot.  [SIGH]
R:  You do.  What do you do for that?
L:  Um, [NOISE] right now we don't live near our --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- family but when we do live near our family they make l- -- it like -- that's like the main holiday practically with the family.  [SIGH]
R:  That's cool.
L:  [SIGH]  They get patriotic music and play it really [LAUGH] l- loud, and [SIGH] --
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  -- tons of fireworks and just a big old barbecue with all the whole b- block.
R:  Mm.  [MN]
L:  And [MN] so it's really fun when we're all together.  Now that we're apart it's kind of funny 'cause we still call each other and we can hear what, ah, everybody's doing in the background.  And [SIGH] so I don't know it's just one of those f- fun things.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Oh, that's neat.  And do you all do watermelon seeds t- thing, ah, seed s- spitting --
L:  [LAUGH]  Y- yeah, --
R:  -- contest and ...
L:  -- all that stuff.  [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Water balloons and --
R:  Fire crackers --
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R: -- a- and all that stuff.  [SIGH]  My mom she makes the best Fourth of July watermelon [SIGH] ice cream cake --
L:  O- o- oh!
R:  -- where she takes --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- green ice --
