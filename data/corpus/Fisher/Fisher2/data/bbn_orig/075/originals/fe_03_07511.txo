R:  Dakario[?] Joe[?].
L:  What?
R:  Dakario.
L:  [MN] Yeah, my name's Marnie Bradley.
R:  Okay.  [NOISE]
L:  [MN]
R:  Did you want to start or you want me to start?
L:  You could start if you want.
R:  [NOISE] Can you hear me?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  Um, [MN] did you want to start or do you want me to start?
L:  You can begin.
R:  Okay.  Um ... Maybe I feel that the, ah, US should, you know --
L:  I'm sorry -- 
R:  -- stop interf- -- huh?
L:  What's your name?
R:  Dakario.
L:  Huh?
R:  Dakario.
L:  Yeah, what's your name?  I'm --
R:  Dakario.
L:  -- Marnie Bradley.
R:  I'm Dakario.
L:  Dakario?  Okay.
R:  Mhm.  Okay.  I th- -- I think they, um, should really stop meddling in everybody else's business and maybe that, ah, um, stop all the terrorism and stuff we got. [PAUSE]  Hello? 
L:  Yeah, I'm here.
R:  Um.  What you think?
L:  Well, I think they're doing pretty good with it in the airports and stuff with checking people out but it's sort of hard to check everybody as they're going into buildings and things, I mean, 'cause that could make a lot of people mad.  I think they have to find a way maybe to check them before they get in.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I think they have, like, mainly with, ah, being in the US and everything, I think they should, like, not, um, consider everybody as a threat, like the, you know, the, um, the people from different countries that are already here --
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause if they were a threat to us they would already be something before this started happening.  You know what I'm saying?
L:  Yeah.  I mean, it- it's sorta -- it's hard just to tell by people though too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because, I mean, you could offend somebody if, you know, you went up to them and said, "Well, we think you have something on you.  Can we check you?", or, "We need to check you", but they see other people just going through.
R:  Yeah.  I think they should, like, not just see one part of the people and just start doing everyone.
L:  Yeah, I think it would have to --
R:  Even people that were foreigners[?].
L:  -- be everybody or you would offend certain other people [MN] but I think at certain places, I mean, where they need it, like, you know, let's say, the Empire State Building or major places like Ellis Island or the Statue of Liberty, it would be hard to do it at places like that too because, I mean, you're already waiting in line to see these things and people would get, I think, upset if they thought they had to wait while you were being checked.
R:  Yeah, they should have, like, more people doing it.
L:  Or there'd have to be more people to do it maybe.
R:  Yeah, like, they should have, like, more than one line.  Should have, like, about ten people and there's, like, Next one please", and they [several inaudible words] available [several inaudible words] next person in line, and let that person go.
L:  Yeah, and then if they find something maybe have a special room where you take that person or something until they can check you more thoroughly.
R:  Mhm.  And they should have, like, um, not just, um, airports but like at the area malls, stuff like that, um --
L:  Yeah, places that aren't popular too, [inaudible].
R:  Yeah, like grocery stores and places where we really don't see people but, you know, they're there, like the libraries and --
L:  Yeah, they could have something like they have, like, now, I know around here, the high schools around here, they have, like, just metal detector type things the kids walk through and put their backpacks and stuff through before they go into school.  I think --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they could do stuff like that at a mall.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I just like it when --
L:  Or a grocery store without --
R:  -- somebody's taking something they should have something that, you know how they have the machines where when you go out the mall and it beeps because somebody's took something --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they should have something that identify --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- objects they shouldn't be there.
L:  Yeah, they could always do that too.
R:  [NOISE] Ah, oh, let's see, they should have, like, important events, no, I know they have security officers for events but they should have, like, more security officers.
L:  Yeah, hire, um, a lot comes down to, I think they're -- they'd have to hire more pe- -- they need more people at places, like events and even just, you know, grocery stores and malls and stuff 'cause around here you only get maybe one or two security guards that -- we have a two floor mall --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and there's, like, only one or two guys to check the entire mall.
R:  Yep.
L:  And I think it comes down to -- you know, to do these things they have to hire more people, which in the end would be good for the economy too.
R:  Yeah.  I agree on -- with -- with you on that because, like, I went to the mall today and only seen two security guards on the shift and it was like a mall of a hundred people.
L:  Well, sometimes even the security guards that are on at our mall, they're together.  They're standing round talking together or something.  They're not even, like, at different places in the mall.
R:  Yeah, and they're not even looking out in the public.  They're just sitting there talking to each other or at Customer Service just sitting there talking to the person at the Customer Service desk --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- instead of walking around the mall like they are hired to do, their job to walk around the mall.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [several inaudible words] 
L:  And I don't know, sometimes I don't think they should wear the uniforms either that say what they are --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because if you are a terrorist, you know, you're -- you're gonna know who th- -- who these people are and you're -- you know, you're gonna find a way to conceal whatever you have.  I mean, you're not going to flash it in front of them, where if they just maybe wore street clothing, you know somebody --
R:  Yeah, kind of like what the undercover cops do.
L:  -- somebody might make a mistake.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Just like the cops do, you know, when they're, you know, [several inaudible words] or something.  They should do that.  Every day they -- they should have some officers that, like, have plain clothes and some that have, you know, uniforms and stuff.
L:  Yeah, I mean, you could have some.  I mean, some, you know, it don't matter if, you know, you're trying to pick up somebody for speeding or something but --
R:  Yeah.  Um, they should have, like, um, some -- you know how some places they have, like, everybody signs their name when they come in the place, they should have that too or show ID when they come in --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- 'cause I know some places I go to they're -- you know, like, you gotta sign the piece of paper the time you came in and show ID and [several inaudible words] visitor.  If you don't have ID they won't let you come back at all.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] But I don't know with the government, I think the whole thing is creating more jobs.  They don't wanna do that, I mean, and they just want to go with what they have.
R:  Yeah, and they should, like --
L:  I mean --
R:  -- there should have been some kind of --
L:  -- you know, if -- if you want to protect people I think you have to have more people doing it.
R:  Yeah and they should of had some kinda warning 'cause I don't know, I [several inaudible words] --
L:  Or even classes for lay people like ourselves, you know, if you could even take a class as to what you were looking for --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if they offered classes that, you know, that maybe, you know, I mean, you -- you might not be able to spot everything but maybe, you know, you could spot a major 'cause there have to be some warning signs or --
R:  Yeah, and this --
L:  -- something that's noticeable.  You know, that they could tell us, you know, to look for or --
R:  Or they should of had, like, they warn us about everything there is, you know, like when there is a fire going on or something or when a tornado's coming, they warn us about them --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- [inaudible] like, at least warn us about, you know, like, in the past, I knew about the underground explosions and stuff like that around the World Trade Centre and they should of been, like, you know, like, gave us more information about it instead of waiting for something major happening to let us know about it.  They should of let us [inaudible].
L:  Yeah, I'm sure that they were warned.  I mean, y -- I mean, you didn't -- you wouldn't have to -- you wouldn't even have to do everybody but for those people, you know, for the people that are in those places, at least --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- let those people know, you know, and have something in plan if something does happen.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause I think for those things they never even had anything in plan for those people that were there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, they should -- you should at least have the right to know if your place --
R:  Especially when you have kids --
L:  -- is a target.
R:  -- you know, like, kids, you know, like, we have younger youth and stuff, you know.  As a parent you still want to know what's going on in your world so you can know how to protect your child and stuff like that.  I mean --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it's -- we got people over here that's homeless and starving and it feels like every time that a country -- another country needs us we always stand for them and then they turn around and stab us in the back, con- contradict [inaudible] or something like that.  That made me upset when I see them, everytime something like a flood happens or a -- a bombing happens we always running over there to help them and we got people over here that needs the same help that they got over there.
L:  Yeah.  It's --
