R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.  
R:  Hi.  
L:  My name's Laurie.
R:  Hi, Laurie.  I'm Paula.
L:  Hi, Paula.  Um, I don't know, I'm not real familiar with the topic, but um, are you real familiar with it or --
R:  Well, just -- I mean, I guess since nine eleven, I've been kind of more familiar with this kinds of things.  Um, but bioterrorism?  Is that when, like -- like chemical kind of terrorism?
L:  Right.  That --
R:  I'm not really sure.  Okay.
L:  Yeah, that -- that's what I think it is, too.  Um, doesn't give you a lot of time to think about it, but um, yes.  And I agree with you, I've also been more focused since nine eleven.  Um, I guess one of my main concerns is um the water sources.  You know, how we constantly keep hearing now and then about different water, the possibility of someone putting something in our water supply.
R:   That's true.  Yeah.  
L:   Um, other than that, I think that um -- what was that white powder stuff?
R:   Oh, um, anthrax.
L:   Yes.  I think that for a little while there was a possible thought that that could be a potential bioterrorist type thing.
R:   And that was done through the mail, right?
L:   Yep.  That's correct.
R:   Yeah.
L:   I think.  [LAUGH].
R:   That is frightening, yeah.  And also --
L:   Um, I --
R:   -- another thing I just thought of is, like, through the vents in, like, offices.  
L:   Oh, yes.
R:   You know, like air conditioning vents, yeah.
L:   Yes.  Absolutely.  And that would be horrible if someone, you know, did get in and did something like that.  Um, other things, let's see.  I've read -- I think I actually read something about um -- well, I know I did, about the spring with the crop dusters, there was a while right after nine eleven where they weren't letting the little planes go up.  Do you remember that?
R:   Mhm.
L:   The crop dusters?  
R:   Oh, yeah.
L:   So I think -- I think that that too was a possible potential.  Um, I don't know if I've really paid a whole lot more attention than that.  I guess we always kinda think it won't happen to us.  We kinda keep our eyes, you know, open, and when something comes up -- I think when they keep raising the alerts to the different colors, I think that's when I pay a little bit more attention.
R:   Yeah, and it's kind of sad because, like -- I mean, who knows what the government's really doing to prevent this kind of stuff?  But um, at the same time it's like are we infringing on people's rights and -- it's just a tough issue.  Like, I don't know -- it's -- it's hard because it's like on one hand it's personal safety and you don't want anything like that to ever happen again, but it's like I know that there's rights being violated right now and that's really hard to deal with too.
L:   That's true.  I agree with you.  It does -- I -- I don't -- and I think I agree with the statement that you just made where um we don't really know -- I think I've always felt that, that we don't really know what is really going on and we don't really know what the government really is doing, even though it really does affect us, you know?  I don't think we really know one hundred percent.  
R:   Um, nor do I think we should really know.  I mean, uh -- I mean, if we did know, then the enemy would know too.
L:   Well, that's a good point.  I hadn't -- I hadn't thought of that.  Um, that is right, because how would they not know, if everyone was aware?  
R:   Yeah.
L:   I'm sure that that would be easily -- information that would be easily obtained by anyone.  So --
R:   Right.  Yeah.  That's -- I mean, I don't know if the question was, are they doing -- if the question we're supposed to answer is, are they doing enough or if they're going too far with it.  I'm not quite sure if I remember the exact --
L:   Yeah, I -- 
R:   -- wording of it.  
L:   I think that it was just that the discussion was to talk about it.  I --
R:   Oh, okay.
L:   You know?  I'm -- you know, I'm not one hundred percent sure because it's such a new thing, I just signed up today, or a --
R:   Oh, me too.  [LAUGH].
L:   -- a few day -- you know, a couple of days ago, and just got the email today and then um all of a sudden the phone rang and so I want to participate in them, but I guess I wasn't as prepared as I should have been.  But um --
R:   Oh, me too.  I don't know.  [LAUGH].
L:   [LAUGH].  So -- but I -- I guess that um my -- you know, I think when -- do you remember, like, when it first -- just a little bit after nine eleven when they were doing that thing, where they were talking about going and buying the duct tape and putting um -- I guess putting plastic up with duct tape all around and buying enough rations to last.  Do you recall that pa- time?
R:   Yes.  
L:   Yeah.
R:   Yes.
L:   And -- and I think that that was the height of -- you know, when most people were very concerned about it.  I kind of think that um at least myself and my immediate friends and family, I think that we've kind of slacked off a little bit.  I mean, you know, I don't think that I have rations avail- you know, enough rations available and -- and occasionally I'll read something and think that maybe I should be paying more attention, because if that happened it would happen, like, you know almost immediately.
R:   I know, and like I haven't either and it's almost been two years since nine eleven and it's -- it's amazing how much it's faded in people's minds.
L:   I think that's true.
R:   Even mine and I was -- I was in -- well, I was in New Jersey when it happened and -- but I mean, I was pretty close proximity to the event and it was --
L:   Oh, my goodness.
R:   -- very frightening and every -- I know everybody was so just shocked by how something like this could happen, but two years later, it's -- I think people are just living life as they were, and I mean, in some ways that's good, but in other ways it's like kind of worrisome.  It's like it is probably something like that will happen again.  And it's like --
L:   Right, and --
R:   -- are we prepared?
L:   Right, and I think that if -- I think um -- I think for a terrorist attack, I think that I am thinking, just from things that I read, that it probably will be some kind of biochemical attack.  If -- if --
R:   Yeah.
L:   -- you know, because that seems like probably -- what I -- what I was -- what I was thinking during that period of time and I mean, I certainly do not want this to happen, but I kinda was thinking some things like it almost was seeming like a game, you know?  I mean, not a good game obviously, but because it would seem that if they really -- the terrorists really were going to strike, I mean, nine eleven, yes of course was very devastating, but if they want to continue to strike, I would think that they would be doing more and like, you know, when I was mentioning before about the water, I would think that there would have been more threats to more wa- lar- large water systems and that type of thing and -- and I don't think that we ever were made aware of really any, in -- that I'm -- remember, do you?
R:   No.  I don't think so.
L:   And I think -- so that kind of -- I kind of -- I don't know, I find it just kind of strange.  Just like if the terrorists were really going to attack and continue to attack, I am surprised that more things haven't happened, do you know what I mean?  More um --
R:   Well, also we're -- the question -- I'm sorry to interrupt you, but --
L:   No, no.
R:   Um, another thing is, we don't know how far the government has gone to prevent such things.  I mean, maybe something like this has happened to the water supply and it's been stopped in it's tracks or the government has come in and like sequestered like a small city, like in the movie Outbreak, you know? 
L:   Mhm.
R:   Where it's like no -- there was no um reporters allowed and we just don't know.  I mean, maybe something like this has happened and we just don't know about it.
L:   That is true.
R:   You know?  I think about that a lot actually.  
L:   Well, that's true.  I guess if you weren't right there.  You know, but then I always wonder, too, if something did happen, like you're saying and like in Outbreak, you know, how --
R:   Yeah?
L:   -- wouldn't you think that eventually it would get, you know, out?  Because you know, maybe -- maybe you're there, maybe I was there and granted, we're all not supposed to, you know, say anything and so forth, but then maybe I tell like a sister.  You know what I'm saying?
R:   Yeah, but --
L:   And eventually people are aware of it.
R:   -- also in -- right.  I think that, too, but then we know that the government -- I mean, I don't know, I'm not -- I don't -- I don't think I'm a necessarily conspiracy bus, but um you know, a lot of things about the JFK thing are still, like, you know, people talk and say things and --
L:   That's true, too.
R:   -- it's like --
L:   That's true, too.
R:   -- I -- I don't think our government is necessarily evil.  I mean, it's not evil, but I think that sometimes they need to hide things from us, to protect us.
L:   So there's not a panic situation.
R:   Almost like a parent, you know --
L:   Right.  Right.  I see what you're saying.  But I do -- I still think that that is a -- you know, possibility any day that something could happen, but I do think you're right, that people have just kind of stopped being as aware of it as we were certainly after nine --
R:   Of nine eleven.
L:   -- eleven.  Yeah.
R:   And I know that the president wants us to be this way.  You remember right after he gave that speech thing, that, "I want things to go back to normal and I don't want children to be frightened every day" and --
L:   Right.  And that is true.  And so I guess in that respect, it has been successful.  Um, I guess that I just think that I wonder if -- kind of again like you're saying about the -- even using that movie, I kinda wonder if it did happen one place, how then would -- and they did go in, you know, and make it very hush, hush and very quiet, I wonder --
R:   And they even killed -- yeah.
L:   Go ahead.  And say -- and what?
R:   I'm sorry, yeah.  They even killed those people who were trying to get out.
L:   Well, that's true.  That's making it more scary.  [LAUGH].  No, but that is true.
R:   [LAUGH].
L:   I -- yeah, you know, I really think that it is something to definitely be aware of and I don't know, I wish I would of listened better to, like you said, when they told us what this -- what we were supposed to discuss, if we were just supposed to discuss our feelings on it or if there was a specific question we were supposed to answer on it.  I don't -- I can't remember now, but I do think that it is -- it -- it still is a frightening issue.  I just don't think it's thought of very often.
R:   And I think, you know, if we were to think about it every single day, what kind of lives would we have?
L:   That's true too.  That would be very -- it's very hard.  I have a small son and I guess that that's an issue.
R:   Oh, me too. 
L:   You know, so --
R:   How old is your son?
L:   Uh, eleven.
R:   Oh.  I have a two year old.
L:   Oh, yours is a lot smaller.  [LAUGH].
R:   [LAUGH].
L:   But -- yeah.  So he's not quite asking the questions yet, but yes, it is, it's always a concern, I think when you're a parent, that uh something could --
