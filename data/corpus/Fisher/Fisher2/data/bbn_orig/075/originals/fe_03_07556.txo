R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  Um --
R:  My name's Hal.
L:  M- my name's Gerry.  How are you?
R:  Fine, thank you.
L:  Good.
R:  Good evening.
L:  Were you surprised about the topic? [LAUGH]
R:  Yes but, um, I guess there's enough to talk about for [LAUGH] ten minutes. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Since I try --
L:  I'm --
R:  -- not to think about it, I guess we can talk about it, [MN] --
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  -- um --
L:  -- think that's what everyone seems to do, is, uh, not talk about it.
R:  Okay.
L:  And I --
R:  So you --
L:  -- went -- because they were searching for someone else to talk to about it, I went online [LAUGH] --
R:  That's okay.
L:  -- and --
R:  Well, go ahead and say whatever you want -- you --
L:  [NOISE] Well, I just think that it's very difficult to be [NOISE] prepared for [NOISE] it, um, [NOISE] aside from all of the, um, things that they've told us to do over the radio and television, uh, having water on hand and, um -- um, food --
R:  Food and, you know --
L:  -- d- duck tape and al- [MN] all of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the things that seem awfully crazy --
R:  I haven't --
L:  -- um ...
R:  -- really heard a lot of, um, [LIPSMACK] insightful conver- -- con- -- um, discussion by people who are specialists or experts in the subject [NOISE] as far as, um, scientists --
L:  Of how and to --
R:  -- or anyone else.  As to how -- how, um, [NOISE] realistic any of those, um, preparations are in -- in helping ordinary people cope --
L:  Well, in --
R:  -- with that, so I'm not --
L:  -- in the to- -- the topic too, was about how can the US prevent --
R:  Bio --
L:  -- yeah --
R:  -- terrorism.  I -- I'm --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- well, I live in the southwest.  I live in Arizona and so, whenever, uh, this kind of creeps into my consciousness, it's a huge -- it's sort of either kind of out there, out beyond the perimeter of [NOISE] my consciousness most of the time, just to get through the day and through my life.  If it becomes -- comes within the range of my consciousness and I start talking about [NOISE] it, then what I have to deal with is the fact that I live two hours from the Mexican border and it's a very porous border and, um -- um, you know, anyone could, in theory [NOISE], um, [LIPSMACK] you know, come across the border.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't know, um -- you know, to -- as far as when they [NOISE] talk about preventing it, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- be prepared, uh, that's sort of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- an afterthought, I think.  Um, the fact --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is, that if --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- anyone is absolutely dogged determined to do that in this country, they're gonna, [NOISE] um, [NOISE] probably be able to carry it out. [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  You know.
L:  Um --
R:  So, it's [LAUGH] -- if you hear what I'm saying [LAUGH], it's sort of -- it's sort of a thing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- either I -- either you think -- you don't think about it, or you think about it and you feel overwhelmed by it because you think --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, if they're really determined --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to change --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- from what they did before to something, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- new on the ground, like, a bio terrorism attack, then, um, in theory, I guess, they could do it quite, [NOISE] um -- quite efficiently and -- and it's not [NOISE] something that really requires, um, [NOISE] you know, any kind [NOISE] of high tech, um, knowledge [NOISE] or anything.  Once they do some -- some basic studying like they did --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- before, um, and know just the basics [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of how [NOISE] to carry --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it out --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't think there's very much that can be done to [NOISE] prevent them, once --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they get beyond a certain stage of, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, being able to smuggle in [NOISE] what --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they need --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and -- and, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- choose their --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- their --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, you know, their time and place.  So, I guess, that sounds very bleak but it's [LAUGH] -- it's how I --
L:  It's --
R:  -- feel. [LAUGH]
L:  -- probably more or less true. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah and it's awful really because, um, you think about, you know, all the millions of dollars that are being spent in prevention and what does it rea- -- what's the real, um --
L:  The ultimate good --
R:  -- reality --
L:  -- that it's --
R:  -- as far as --
L:  -- done, yeah. 
R:  I think it's sort of like you o- -- you only learn in the aftermath of these things, what can be done the next time around but then the next time around, um, that's the nature of terrorism, is that it reinvents [NOISE] itself like a [NOISE] virus that won't die, that keeps mutating.  So, it keeps on coming up with new -- new scenarios and you're, you --
L:  Right.
R:  -- know, you're sort of dancing in the dark with the enemy and the enemy's deciding what the steps to the dance i- er, is, if you see what I mean, right?
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  So, it's -- it's -- I -- I sound very --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- pessimistic but it's just like I --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I think that's the reality [NOISE] and -- and all these color codes and all these other things and -- [NOISE] and, um, I think the rehearsals that they do in the big cities are fine and well and -- [NOISE] and it probably is better than [NOISE] doing nothing [LIPSMACK] but it's not like they say, a hun- -- like, they've admitted, it's not a hundred percent, um, prevention, so ...
L:  Right and probably just letting the people know that this is a possibility, is about the best thing that they can do f- f- for the people, [NOISE] uh, short [NOISE] of being able to prevent it. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, because then [NOISE], yeah, at least they're forewarned and --
R:  It's a dilemma --
L:  -- when they do --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] When they do --
R:  I think it's --
L:  -- get an opportunity to think about it for a little while and I [NOISE] -- and I do think people only think about it for a little while and shove it back --
R:  Exactly --
L:  -- in the --
R:  -- that's what I'm --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- saying, kind of just shove it out of my consciousness and then I think, you know, it's sort of, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, do all -- uh, do all these rehearsals, let the enemy know what -- what not to do.  You know, you think, um, you know, that -- are we like a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- dog chasing it's own tail here?  It's like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, how do you really, um, [LIPSMACK] deal with -- it's like a kind of a poker game of life [NOISE] and death [NOISE], like how do you deal [NOISE] with someone who's really [NOISE] setting the rules of the game ahead of you and has been, you know, by their own [NOISE] admission, now, planning this for years --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and years in advance, so that they have that [NOISE] sort of [NOISE] a [LIPSMACK], um, a lead in -- in deciding what they're going to do next?  How do you catch --
L:  [LIPSMACK] That's true.
R:  -- up to --
L:  But I do --
R:  -- yeah, uh --
L:  -- I do think our security m- measures, all their [NOISE] -- y- you can't [NOISE] predict or plan or -- when something like this really would happen [NOISE], I think the security measures are necessary.  I mean, I feel better that there -- er, they have better security measures at the airports and I --
R:  Oh, sure --
L:  -- feel --
R:  -- I mean, there's things --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that -- but it's sort of like react -- always reacting in the -- in the aftermath about what you're gonna prevent happening the next time around.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- do you [LAUGH] -- I think --
R:  Except it's like --
L:  -- how we could really prevent it.  I shouldn't even say this, is, I'll became an +antitrust litigator and I will sue the car companies under the imminent domain laws to retrieve the shelved patents that they have, for the vehicles and things that don't have to use oil. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um --
R:  I know where you're going with it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I know --
R:  That's -- that's --
L:  -- that won't happen --
R:  -- something they should've --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- yeah and that's --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- another thing they should've done twenty years ago --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- before they got into this situation with these countries.
L:  Be- because I don't think this would --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- be happening --
R:  Yeah, if we didn't have --
L:  -- had we taken care of --
R:  -- that relationship.
L:  -- that.
R:  Yeah but it's all the out- -- it's all the -- this is all the [NOISE] outcome [NOISE] of --
L:  Hindsight.
R:  -- years of --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- yeah, of --
L:  But it's not hindsight either [LAUGH] --
R:  It's --
L:  -- because you could predict that this would happen.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because it --
R:  They could --
L:  -- wasn't taken --
R:  -- well, sometimes --
L:  -- care of.
R:  -- you can predict and people want to ignore what they see because it doesn't s- suit their agenda, so ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know.  I'm [LAUGH] -- I'm very pro, um, [LIPSMACK] you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- alternative energy and everything like that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and it has to be maybe one of the [NOISE] good things that comes of it -- out of this.  But as far as the bio [NOISE] thing, I think it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's -- it's terrifying and -- and maybe that's why it's very difficult --
L:  Anthrax.
R:  -- to, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- even -- even speculate about what can be done.  It seems like, what they've done -- they've tried to do, is fine and well but, um, you know, then you hear about -- I- I've heard about other things, about, um, you know, like all these rogue, um, nuclear sites that they have in, uh, Soviet -- the, uh, former [NOISE] Soviet [NOISE] Union, which is the real, um, [NOISE] thing they're afraid would -- would be the source of, um, getting the, um, equip- -- some of the, uh, equipment for dirty bomb and all that.  And I guess that's bio --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- terrorism too because that come -- they could -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they could put, um, [LIPSMACK] some of these biological things in a bomb, a dirty bomb of some kind.
L:  Yes.
R:  I don't know.  There's all these -- all these variations of -- of what --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, could happen next and bio terrorism versus n- you know, nuclear dirty -- dirty things and combinations of the two and, um, [LAUGH] and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, so on, so [NOISE] it's, uh ...
L:  It's like --
R:  I- it -- it --
L:  -- prevention is -- is near impossible. [LAUGH]
R:  You know, it's sort of a law of odds, like you're trying to reduce the risk, just as you would not drive recklessly or something but it doesn't mean [NOISE] you'll [NOISE] be safe all your life, going out on the roads.  So, um, what can be done?  I guess -- I guess, um, just hope that they're doing -- they're honestly doing with, you know, all their int- -- with integrity, what can be done.  That, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that's something I feel cynical about [LAUGH] as well. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So, I -- I don't know.  It's, uh --
