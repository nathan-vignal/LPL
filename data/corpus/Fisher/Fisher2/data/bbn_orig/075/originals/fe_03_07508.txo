L:  [MN] Doreen.
R:  Ah, Gina.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, bioterrorism, huh? [MN]
L:  Oh, yes. [MN]
R:  Okay.  Ah, so, what do you think?
L:  [MN] Ah, let me think.  Well, I -- I think it's a very, um -- it's a timely topic.  Bioterrorism to me is very scary.  It's a very, um, [MN] you know, could happen at any time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  To anyone and it's the, um, it's the mass destruction --
R:  Ah --
L:  -- that, you know.
R:  I know.  Ah, you know, what really is scary is [MN] the, um, like, the chemical weapons --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and disease because that could -- I mean, it only takes just one little bit and everybody's got it.
L:  I know.  That's what's so weird, and one or two people can do -- can do a lay down and that's it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And the what -- what -- what one person could do is -- it's just mind boggling and it really humbles you when you think about it.
R:  [MN] I know.
L:  You know.  It's very scary and it's just -- and this isn't a machine or i- it could be your neighbor.  It can be anyone --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know.  It could be your uncle and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's what's really frightening, you know.  It's -- it's very frightening --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- to think about.
R:  Yeah. [LIPSMACK] I, um, I don't think that there's really anything that they can do --
L:  No, me neither.
R:  -- ah, to -- to prepare.  Um, I mean, they come up with some of these vaccines and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- they say, "Oh, you take this and you'll be fine", but there's -- then they say, "Well, there's not enough for everybody". [LAUGH]
L:  I know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's right.
R:  It's like --
L:  So, yeah --
R:  -- okay --
L:  -- who's going to win the lottery?
R:  -- but -- but I'll bet you the President and his family got --
L:  Oh, of course.
R:  -- invacc- -- inoculated, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, you know that.  Please.  Double -- double times[?].  So, but ...
R:  Yeah, I really don't think that there's -- there's anything they can do, um, [MN] e- even with, ah, ah, even with, like, the Post Office --
L:  Right.
R:  You know, they can check these letters but then what if the Post Office people get infected?
L:  Right.
R:  They go home to their families.  They infect them.
L:  Right.
R:  They go to the movies that night.  Everybody at the movie theater's infected.  
L:  Well --
R:  I mean, it's --
L:  Well, what -- and what's the point though of th- that type of destruction?
R:  I know.
L:  What point are you making?  You know.
R:  I know.
L:  Because, ah, really, you -- if you do a do a lay down in a whole area, okay, are you going to go, "Okay, well, I got this area".  Okay, let's say Ohio.  Okay, well, Ohio has been devastated.
R:  Right.
L:  Well, what are you gonna do?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I wouldn't wanna be walking around in there.  You know what I'm saying?
R:  No, exactly.  
L:  So, that's what --
R:  Because it's not like --
L:  -- I'm trying to figure out, you know.  I don't --
R:  You know.
L:  I don't like the idea that -- and just the idea, you know, well, all -- anything like that is just born of hate anyway.
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  And it's like --
R:  Well, look at --
L:  -- you know, come on.
R:  -- you know, these -- the reason why the, ah, Saddam had known that these, ah, diseases and everything would work so well is because first he tried 'em out on his own people.
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  I mean --
L:  I'm, like, God.
R:  -- I saw pictures of babies laying in the street --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you know with their mothers right beside them and they're, you know, just dead from these horrible diseases --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and -- or chemical weapons that he's been using.  I mean, of course, this is biological weapons that we're talking --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- about but, um, [MN] the chemical weapons, oh!
L:  It's terrible.  Yeah, his -- his people -- yes, that's his focus group. [MN]
R:  Mhm.  Exactly.
L:  That's his --
R:  That's his focus group.
L:  -- I don't know if you saw that political car- cartoon.  That's [several inaudible words] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] He's not in a lab somewhere.  He's -- he's got the actual people.  So, I'm, like, man.
R:  I know, it -- it's really awful and I don't think that all those peace talks that they're doing is really gonna do any good.
L:  No.
R:  I really don't because [MN] there's conflict the next day.
L:  Sure.  
R:  You know, there's --
L:  Someone's gonna always hold the  --
R:  -- only peace between the governments.
L:  Exactly.  They're always gonna have something back.  They're gonna always have something in the back pocket 'cause you --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- never know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So -- yeah, you're right.
R:  And there's always gonna be some nut who's sitting away in, um, you know, a room somewhere saying --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- "Okay, when they think everything's good, I'm gonna come out".
L:  Ex- -- there you go.  That- that's who scares me, the extremist.
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  You know, sitting somewhere, you know, like you just said, and if -- if -- even if you aren't part of big government, anybody who ever has a grudge --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- at any time.  It's what I said after nine eleven.  I said, "Okay, now here come -- watch these people come out of the woodwork and everything.  Anybody who's ever had a grudge, had a reason to not wanna conform or to -- "
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- hate, here you go, the nuts, seriously".
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  So, and you can -- you can with -- with -- with whatever amount of money it costs you can call a lab and get -- you can have stuff sent to you.  It happens --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- all the time.
R:  Oh, you can make stuff on the net. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  Sure.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah --
R:  You're looking at --
L:  -- you can get a recipe over the net --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- you know.
R:  -- you can --
L:  There you go.
R:  -- and -- and what I don't understand is, okay, the government does so much regulation with, um, the Internet.  You know, oh, don't let your kids see this, don't let your kids see that but they'll let any kind of hate group -- I mean, I understand freedom of speech --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but, to me, freedom of speech shouldn't be allowed if it causes, you know, can cause --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- physical harm to people.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And a site that teaches you how to make a bomb.  I mean, what are you gonna do with that bomb?  You gonna go fishing?
L:  I know.
R:  I mean, come on.
L:  I -- I mean, there's the things that people --
R:  You're making the bomb to kill somebody.
L:  Exactly.
R:  [MN]
L:  The things that people think of. 
R:  'Cause --
L:  I just --
R:  It's not fireworks.  [MN]
L:  I know, like, man, yeah, well, bioterrorism, I mean.  I don't think that they're gonna be able to, um, peace talks [MN] please!
R:  I know.
L:  You know, if you got it.
R:  Talk [MN] -- yeah, just like they said that World War two was the war to end all wars.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  How many have we had since then?
R:  [MN]
L:  Good grief.
R:  Can you even count them?
L:  I know.  [LAUGH]
R:  Hundreds.  Hundreds.  Hundreds.  
L:  I know.  It's just, like, you know, but --
R:  You know, millions of people have lost their lives and for what?  Nothing.  
L:  Mhm.  Separated -- 
R:  Absolutely nothing.
L:  -- from their families.  Yeah, so --
R:  You know.
L:  You know, but, no, I -- I don't think that there is anything they can do about it --
R:  No.  I don't think so either.
L:  -- and as time goes on -- as time goes on your weapons are quicker, faster, smarter --
R:  Mhm.
L:  They know more now than they did sixty years ago and --
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  -- and everything so as time goes on, you know, everything is gonna be, [MN] ah, much like I just said, quicker and, you know, more --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- able to --
R:  And it's gonna be a flash thing.  I mean, you know, when they go to attack it's just gonna be quick and done.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And we wouldn't have time to put plastic wrap on our windows.
L:  [MN]
R:  You know what I'm saying? [MN]
L:  And duct tape.  Don't forget the duct tape.
R:  And du- -- oh, that's right.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Forgot the duct tape.  Heaven forbid.
L:  Do you know --
R:  And do you have your store of dried food and water? [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  One -- one of my friends her son could not go overseas 'cause he's in the -- he's out at Barksdale --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- because he didn't have a -- a gas mask.  They could not get --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- one that fits him --
R:  Oh, honestly.
L:  -- 'cause his mouth is too small.  I'm, like, "Well, didn't they get some duct tape?"  You know, but--
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what she wants to know, well what did they use during basic 'cause I know they get those things during basic training --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- and don't they -- how come they aren't prepared for the various face -- sized faces -- face sizes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I go, yeah, what about that?  What's he been doing for two years?
R:  [MN] No.
L:  -- that they didn't -- couldn't -- they, yeah, if he found a mask --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- on his own he could go overseas.
R:  The things that -- the thing that gets me about that kind of thing is I remember when this war first started.  They kept saying, oh, you know, this group is making up care packages and that group's making up care packages --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and we've got to send, you know, baby wipes and stuff and I said, you know what, it's really pathetic.  We put all this money into the military and they don't have facilities for them to get clean --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that we have to buy baby wipes.
L:  [MN] Yeah, now, yeah.  I wonder what --
R:  You know, and what are baby wi- -- and I mean --
L:  -- what are they doing with these baby wipes, yeah?
R:  Yeah, and I think about -- I think about, you know, um, the defence of the -- the, okay.  Who do you think would be attacked first with bio weapons?  It would be the army.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  And by the time they would get the masks on.  I mean, I don't know if you saw that news report, um, that just came out not long ago where they showed, like, um, ah, some kind of, ah, [MN] it's like a, not a barrack, but, like, a place where, you know, a whole bunch of soldiers were and they had all computers and stuff --
L:  Right.
R:  My brain's shutting down.
L:  Oh, no problem.
R:  But anyway.  Um, [MN] and there was this attack and half of them put their face masks on.  The other half didn't --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- or they just kind of stood around --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and I'm thinking, if this was a real attack and that was a real, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- serious thing --
L:  They can be [inaudible] as --
R:  -- half of those soldiers would have gotten sick and probably infected the other half.
L:  Mhm.  Definitely.
R:  [MN] I mean, it's obvious to me that they weren't even taking it -- they were taking it seriously but it was kind of like they were all standing around going, "Is this for real?"  You know. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Like --
L:  Well, it's like, yeah, I know, that, you know, you get, every minute -- 
R:  And, and, that's the problem, that's what would happen over here.  There would be a news report on television and it would say, "Okay", you know, "there's been a bio attack.  Everyone get prepared", [MN] and then all of a sudden, ah, you know, some people would go, "Oh, let's get prepared".  Other people would be sitting in their cars, other people would be out in their backyard, you know what I mean?
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  
R:  Your know -- 
L:  I totally agree.
R:  -- there's no real way to warn everyone so that it's effective.  Even in tornado warnings --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- there's no real warning.
L:  Exactly.  Yeah, some -- 
R:  You know, so ...
L:  -- some communities are prepared or -- or at least know about it.  Other ones, "Oh, they didn't tell us until two seconds before it hit", so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you're right.  You're exa- -- you're exactly right.  
R:  I -- and, you know, even if every person in the w- -- in the planet had perfect protection in their house somewhere, you've gotta know that it's coming.
L:  Sure.  
R:  [MN]
L:  Exactly.  You know, and then like --
R:  You know.
L:  -- and who wants to live in fear all the time?
R:  Right.
L:  You know.
R:  And if they put something in the drinking water --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it would take too -- people would start being sick before they would notice something was wrong and by then it might be too late.
L:  Right, exactly.  E- exactly.
R:  You know, especially if they put something really deadly in there.  I mean, you know, like, Ebola or --
L:  Ooh.  That's some nasty stuff.
R:  -- you know, the Hanta virus or something like that.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know.
L:  Exactly.  That's some nasty stuff.  So, I'm, like, you know --
R:  That is really nasty stuff. [MN]
L:  -- and what I want to know is, to what end?  What is it that you're doing?
R:  [MN]
L:  You know.  It's --
