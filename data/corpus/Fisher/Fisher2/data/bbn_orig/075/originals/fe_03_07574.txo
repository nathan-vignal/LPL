L:  Hi.  I'm Anna.
R:  Oh, hi.  I'm Keesa.
L:  Hi, Keesa.
R:  How you doing?
L:  Oh, I'm doing all right.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  How are you today?
R:  I'm all right.  Just laying in bed.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  I'm sitting in bed watching TV, too.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.  
L:  I'm in Oregon.  Where are you?
R:  New York.
L:  Oh.  So do you want to talk about sports?
R:  I guess we got to.  [LAUGH].  
L:  Well, I'm not really --
R:  Do you even watch sports?
L:  -- a -- I don't -- I don't really watch sports myself.  My friend's husband watches them, so I get stuck watching football a lot, but --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I'm not really into sports.  If I was gonna pick a sport to watch on TV, it would probably be baseball because to me, um that's something I could understand everything.  I know all the rules pretty much, you know?
R:  Mm.
L:  I know what's going on and I wouldn't lose interest as much as like with football or something that's where I do not know all the rules.  What about you?
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, as far as um I go, I -- I guess the -- my, like you said, your boyfriend or husband watches football.  My boyfriend watches football a bunch, but I don't even watch it with him.  Like, the only sport that I could probably catch myself watching would be basketball and not even because I, like, like a team or anything, it's just like I know when it makes it in the hoop, that's a good thing.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  So I'm like, okay, yay for that, and then I know some of the players.  Like, they have their own, like -- you know, the -- the top players that are pointed out in the media constantly?  Well, I know them so it's kinda like, okay, if they're on one of the teams, and I know that I'm kinda rooting for that team because, oh well, I at least know their name or something like that.  So --
L:  You know what?  Now that you mention it, basketball is kinda fun to watch and exciting, too.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And it is easy to understand, 'cause like you said, they pretty much have to go to their side and put it in the basket.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.  I don't know.  I probably -- I don't -- but on a weekly basis, like I know one of the questions was, like, how often or how long I watch --
L:  Uh-huh.
R: -- but probably five minutes.  Please, I don't watch sports at all.
L:  Yeah, me too.  Only if I get stuck watching it and you know, there's more than one TV in the house so you don't --
R:  You know, just go to another room.
L:  -- really get stuck watching it.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Or unless it's in a movie I'm watching, to tell the truth.
L:  Oh, that's true.
R:  Yeah.  Like, I've watched, um -- remember the Titans, and that's a football movie?
L:  Oh, that's a good movie.
R:  That's a really good movie.  And what else?  I don't know.  Some other sports things, but whatever.
L:  But, yeah, there was a lot of movies with sports in 'em.  Yeah.  I could think of, like, um that movie with Kevin Costner, Field of Dreams", like baseball.
R:  Oh, my God.  Yay.
L:  That was a good movie.
R:  Really liked that movie.  Very weird, because I'm thinking, if I were to read that script, would I be really interested in a movie like this?  Talking about, like, ghosts and building a field and if you build it, they will come.  I'm like, okay, that's weird, but um definitely a good movie.
L:  Yeah.  I think the actors and the way they portrayed it and stuff definitely made it a good movie and -- and even to people like us that aren't really interested in sports.
R:  Sports, right.
L:  There's other ones like -- well, on TV I always used to watch Coach.  You know, that --
R:  Oh, yay.
L:  He was a football coach and that was --
R:  That -- yeah --
L:  -- fun to watch.
R:  Yeah, I -- yeah.  I liked to watch Coach.  I -- I think --
L:  He was real competitive.
R:  -- I was a big fan.  I was a big fan of that one.
L:  That's one reason why I don't like sports, because of it's so competitive and when I look at, like, Coach, like how competitive he was and stuff.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  It -- I know it's TV and they kind of exaggerate it, but I'm sure there's people even worse than that.
R:  Just like that and worse, yep.
L:  But I'm like more of the hippie type and so I think life should be more fair and -- but I -- there doesn't always have to be, like, a winner or a loser, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so that's one reason why I don't really watch a lot of sports or not really into 'em.  What about you?
R:  Well, why don't I watch sports?  I'm just not interested.  I could care less.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I can really care less.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Um, like I actually used to watch, like, hockey on TV and um like but that'll only be if I'm flicking through uh flipping through channels.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I'd watch, like, hockey or something and then uh -- and it's just kinda like, okay, yeah, slam somebody up against the wall, that's great fun.  So I don't really know.  I don't really -- I'm just not really interested in sports, but -- 
L:  You know what?
R:  Yeah, it's all fun and games or -- because actually since my boy- my boyfriend actually played football.
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  So it's like you just build a bunch of friendships from that and you know, when I see some of these guys on TV, like, that are on the same team and how they'll, like, cry for each other.  Like, this other game that they had, or they -- they played when the Lakers were going into, like, the playoff or championships or something like that and --
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  -- Kobe Bryant was crying and stuff and everybody was like, okay, well he's a punk but it's like he became so passionate about sport that they're gonna cry on TV?  Isn't that kind of embarrassing for a guy?  But, yeah.  
L:  Yeah.  It's good that they have that -- that they can do that because one of the things that I don't like about it, I got pretty disillusioned with all the money stuff, so when you see that people still do have that feeling for it, it does --
R:  Yeah, some actual --
L:  It does make me feel better.
R:  -- passion behind it and just not a pay check.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, this is just my job -- yeah.
L:  I was gonna ask you, who do you think is, like, the best looking man in sports and stuff and I was gonna -- trying to think in my mind who I would say and I don't even know enough --
R:  Enough people to even say it.
L:  -- people to pick one.  [LAUGH].
R:  I mean, out of the names that I know, I guess I only know basketball players, but the cutest basketball player I guess is Alan Iberson[?] and that's only because I like tattoos because his face really isn't that cute.  But I'm really --
L:  See, I don't even know --
R:  [inaudible].
L:  -- who he -- I -- the name I could recognize --
R:  Really?
L:  -- but I can't picture -- see --
R:  Who it is?  Okay.  
L:  Like, I know who Kobe Bryant is of course, and I know who, like um, Shaq and --
R:  Shaquille [inaudible] yeah.
L:  You know, all the ones that are, like --
R:  But they're not really attractive.
L:  -- in movies or like um Denis Rodman, all over TV and stuff like that.
R:  Definitely not attractive.  [LAUGH].
L:  But I -- I don't really know any -- any of them just for sports.
R:  Mm.  Okay.  
L:  And I'm old.  I'm, like, I'm forty one, so when I think of ones when I was growing up and stuff, well that's a whole long time ago and I can't even hardly remember the names of 'em.
R:  Oh, Derek Jeter.  You said you watched baseball?
L:  Yeah, but I can't picture -- I don't watch it that much.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I was just saying, if I picked one, that would probably be the one that I would pick to watch, but --
R:  Oh, okay.  Right.
L:  -- the name sounds familiar.
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  [LAUGH]. 
R:  Mm.
L:  So.  So are we just supposed to keep talking?
R:  Yeah.  I think we're supposed to actually talk about sports for like eight minutes.
L:  Eight minutes?  
R:  That's a really long time to talk about a subject you really don't have interest in, but work it out.  I don't know.
L:  I don't know how long have we been talking?  
R:  I don't know.  They said that they'll cut it off after ten, so --
L:  After ten?
R:  Yeah.  The -- the phone will just like au- automatically cut off or something.  But yeah.
L:  So how did you find out about this study?
R:  Um, it act- it was actually emailed to me from this um little group that I was on, on ALO, so that's how I found out about it.  
L:  Yeah.  I found out about it through the Freelance BYU site.  That's where --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- I get a lot of free stuff, like free magazines and I've --
R:  Mhm.  
L:  Ten dollar tracks and all kinds of stuff.  Do you ever go to Freelance BYU?
R:  No.  
L:  It's Freelance BYU dot com.  
R:  Mhm?
L:  And they have all the good deals and stuff.
R:  That's hot.  I'm gonna write that one down.  
L:  That's how I found out about this.  And surveys.  They -- I get a lot of free magazines and stuff from lo- just reading her newsletter.  And if you have money to spend and you're buying stuff, they have good deals on buying stuff, too.  I don't have --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- a lot of money so I just take --
R:  You just prefer the free stuff?
L:  -- advantage of a lot of those, but --
R:  Mm.  
L:  The free stuff's always cool.
R:  Right.  Definitely.  So, yeah.
L:  So do you live, like, right in New York City?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Oh, like what part?
R:  Um, do you know, um, like Manhattan and the Boroughs and stuff like that?
L:  Well, I've heard of them.  Like, I live across the country and I've heard of them.  That's why I asked.  I'm not really familiar.  Like, I've never been there or anything like that.
R:  Like, uh, I'm pro- where I live is probably like the tourist spots, where people always come.  Like, Manhattan and the Bronx and stuff like that.  Like the Bronx.  I don't know if you ever heard about it?
L:  Yeah, I've heard of it. 
R:  But yeah, that's where I -- where I live.
L:  That's cool.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I grew up in San Francisco, but I've lived in Oregon since I was twenty two, so for like twenty years now I've lived in Oregon.
R:  Right.  Oh, okay.  Well, I was actually born in Barbados.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  How long did you live there?
R:  I came up here when I was seven.
L:  Oh, so do you really remember it?
R:  Not really, but I -- I've gone back on vacation, so I --
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  -- do know, like -- but I really don't remember a bunch of stuff.  [MN].
L:  So you actually live in the big city.  Do you live, like, in a big tall apartment building?
R:  Yep.  It's --
L:  Like on the high floor of an apartment building?
R:  I live on the -- I'm on the fourteenth floor.
L:  Fourteenth?  That's not too bad.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Do you like it?  Like, I couldn't imagine what it would be like to open my front door and just see a -- nothing but a row of other doors.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Is that how it is?
R:  That's exactly how it is.  But um I like it.  I def- I mean, I really don't know much different.  Like, when I was living on Barbados, like yeah sure, I had a house or whatever, but since I've been up here since I was seven, it's kinda like, okay, I actually like being in a high rise apartment.  I would prefer to go higher.  I have a great view and like when you're living in a house, all you can see is like through the next person's window or you know -- you know, as far as like even if there's an apartment -- I mean, houses around, you can only -- only look at, like, trees or whatever, so I like my view.  I like the -- the high rise building.
L:  Yeah.  I live in a real scenic state where, like, you just look out your window and you could see mountains.  You just drive down the street to the grocery store, you could see mountains on all sides and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- all the lakes and stuff are only, like, fifteen minutes from here and um the tall -- like, Portland probably has tall apartments, but I live in Eugene and the tallest place here is the old folks' home and it's like ten stories high or something.
R:  Okay.
L:  And everything else is just --
