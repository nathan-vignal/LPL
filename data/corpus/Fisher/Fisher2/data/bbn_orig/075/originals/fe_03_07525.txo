R:  Hi. 
L:  Hi.
R:  This is Suzanne.
L:  Hello.  My name is Deborah.
R:  Hi, Deborah.
L:  [MN] It's a hard topic today. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] Kind of a heavy one.
L:  [MN]
R:  Bioterrorism.
L:  [MN]
R:  So, what do you think the US can do?
L:  Oh, [LIPSMACK], I don't know.  I don't know if there's very much we can do.
R:  [MN]
L:  Ah, [MN] ...
R:  Well, I -- I was checking some stuff out on the web and, bottom line, it said people need to know what it is.  They need to know, you know, kind of, how it works and that knowledge would be the biggest tool.  So, I was thinking, sort of, [LIPSMACK] [MN] you know --
L:  Education -- 
R:  --outreach programs or education.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, I don't know what the best format would be to do that, given the diversity of people in the United States and how they communicate. [MN]
L:  Mhm. [MN]
R:  So ...
L:  Ah, but, yeah, I guess I agree but probably the only way we can do is just educating the public on if it happens what we need to do.  Ah, I don't know that there is, if they wanted, if the terrorists out there have that plan that that's what they want to do, I don't know if there's anything we can really do to prevent it.
R:  I know.  Well, I heard --
L:  Other than just being prepar- prepared for it.
R:  Exactly, but [MN] there's a fine line between being sort of educated and prepared and I have friends in New York who were buying plastic and taping up their windows and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- taking out their air conditioners and they were buying bottled water 'cause they were afraid that the, um, water supply was going to be contaminated [MN] and if you read stuff from the government they said the US water is one of the safest in the entire world and that there's a lot of precautions and safeguards in place.
L:  [MN]
R:  So, the -- how -- how much do you trust what the government's doing to actually protect us?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Not that much.  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  Oh, they tell that -- I believe they tell us what they want us to know --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- ah, as much as they have to tell us, you know, to keep the heat off of -- off of them if something does happen but [MN] no, I don't think they're very honest with us about anything that's going on.  
R:  [MN] I would tend to agree --
L:  m
R:  -- unless they get caught -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and then they -- they -- 
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- have to. [MN] So, between, ah, SARS and monkey pox and -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- anthrax and [MN], I don't know, salmonella.  What do you think, ah, how do you think the -- if we do get attacked by bioterrorism, what form do you think it'll take?
L:  Ah, ah, well, I'm not sure.  [MN] I don't know.  I -- I mean, they s- -- they may say that water is the saf- -- the saf- -- that we have the safest water but I believe in something that's, you know, something like the water supply, something that would, ah, contaminate lots of people, you know, pretty easily.
R:  [MN]
L:  I don't know.
R:  Right, well the -- right when nine eleven happened there was this rumor that they were going to, um, [LIPSMACK] use some kind of contact agent on US currency so it would [MN] basically make everybody in the entire world afraid of the US dollar --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- because people could get a disease potentially from touching it or from using it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, that -- that kind of freaks me out --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- more than the water thing, I think, [MN] but ...
L:  I've never heard that one but ...
R:  You didn't hear that one?
L:  Mm mm.
R:  No.  Oh, I'm on the west coast.  Where are you?
L:  Oh, I'm in Houston, Texas.
R:  You're in Houston, Texas.  Okay. [MN] So, [LIPSMACK], well, I mean, Texas is pretty big.  You got a lotta space in between [MN] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but people still travel a lot so things get spread pretty easily, huh?
L:  Yeah, [MN] pretty easily.  Ah, in fact, they had a couple of cases of SARS down here in Houston.  Ah, some people that were traveling to, ah, the Orient [COUGH] brought it back. [LIPSMACK] Nobody actually died from it but they did have a couple of cases here.
R:  Do you know if there's anybody's died in the United States from SARS?
L:  I don't think so.
R:  I -- I heard Canada, yes, and [inaudible] of the government cover up, supposedly, trying to, or whatever, was not very upfront about how many people actually had it and how many people died from it.  So ... but I didn't think we had had any deaths in the United States.
L:  No, ah, we were -- d- down in the Houston area, we were a- -- we were affected a lot last summer with the West Nile virus --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with the mosquitoes.
R:  Okay.
L:  Oh, we had several, ah, deaths down here last summer with that.
R:  Now, did the hospitals do anything [MN] special in -- in -- to ramp up for -- for something like that, do you know? 
L:  No, not that I'm aware of.
R:  'Cause S- SARS, the thing that scared me is that it sounded like the cure was basically to put the person on a respirator and respirators are expensive and limited.  It's not like a, you know, a drug that you can just manufacture tons of, so, I was afraid that if we really did have a huge outbreak of it there would definitely be, um, a shortage and that, you know, people with the most money would get the -- the respirators --
L:  l
R:  -- and the rest of the people would die.
L:  That's something to think about. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Mm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] I wish this had been about travel or something. [LAUGH] Okay --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- so, ah, [MN] how do you think, um, they go about determining whether an outbreak like monkey pox is actually terrorism or is just something that -- that happened and would have happened anyway?
L:  Oh, I don't know.  I mean, I -- I think all of these diseases are just popping up in the last year or two.  My opinion is I think they probably are, you know, because, I mean, it's like, what in the last two years, two or three years, you have all of these dreaded diseases that nobody's ever heard of that just seem to come out of nowhere.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, you know, where are they starting?  Ah --
R:  [MN] Where are they starting and how are they starting?
L:  Mhm.
R:  'Cause, ah, well, I mean, like, some of the stuff like smallpox, obviously we thought we had eradicated and so people aren't even getting --
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  -- inoculated against it any more but ... I have mine but then I heard if it's past, what thirteen years, you're -- you're not safe any more?
L:  Mm.  Yes, I think something like that.
R:  Yeah, but then, [MN] like you said, the stuff like monkey pox and everything, it sounds like somebody messed with an existing strain and they caused it to mutate and that's [MN] i- it doesn't sound like it's happening naturally.
L:  Yes.  I mean, where it's bioterrorism or whether it's some scientist who's just, you know, messing up, I don't know, [MN] but, [MN] ah, [LIPSMACK] somebody's doing something, I believe.
R:  Yeah, and --
L:  But, you know, maybe --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- maybe within, you know, may not be terrorism, may be somebody within some other anti government group, you know, I don't know.
R:  [MN] Well, right, if it's for financial or ideological or just gain and so it doesn't have to make sense to us as long as it makes sense to them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [MN] But even stuff like, it seems like people get a lot more cancer these days because of air pollution and water pollution and free radicals roaming the atmosphere and stuff so, maybe it's something we're also doing to ourselves to cause these diseases which is kind of a sad thought.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Well, which -- which of the diseases or the forms of biot- bioterrorism do you, ah, fear the most?
R:  [SIGH] I was trying to think about that --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and it said that only, what, plague, smallpox and some of the others are spread person to person so, [MN] I think the ones that would freak me out more would be the ones that are kind of airborne --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I honestly would have to take a look at, you know, a list of diseases to figure out which is which [MN] 'cause to me that seems like those are the easiest to spread and that's how [LIPSMACK] i- it -- someone was explaining to me how the SARS spread in, um, I guess it was in Hong Kong or wherever, in the hotel that the sewers got backed up and so it -- the people had diarrhea, I guess, and [MN] um, even though it had flushed down it was still right underneath the drain in their bathroom and then it evaporated out into the atmosphere and then that's how the people got sick and then they spread --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it to other people.
L:  Ah.
R:  So, I think anything that's airborne freaks me out more than something that is, um, waterborne because it's just, you can take precautions against something, like you could drink bottled water, but short of wearing a gas mask which I guess also was a hot item around nine eleven, ah, and doesn't look too attractive, I don't think you can really protect yourself from breathing.
L:  No.
R:  So, did you ever read Stephen King, The Stand?
L:  No.
R:  Oh.  It -- it's literally about, kind of, [MN] the destruction of the world by disease and -- and very few people survive and then it's very interesting to see the dynamics in the groups that do survive.
L:  Mm.
R:  And then you're left with the whole sort of, you know, post apocalyptic, ah, things like, what do you do with all the dead bodies?  'Cause if you weren't sick to begin with you've got --
