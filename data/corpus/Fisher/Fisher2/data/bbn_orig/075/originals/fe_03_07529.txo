R:  [MN]
L:  Hello.  My name is Amy.
R:  My name is Anne.  I live in Tennessee.
L:  Hi, Anne.
R:  Um, I -- we're supposed to talk about bioterrorism?
L:  Right, and what the US can do to prevent it.
R:  [MN] Well, that is -- I don't know if anyone knows how to prevent it but I think that, ah, I think that -- that e- educating people on knowing [NOISE] what to do in case of is very important.  Ah, what do you think? [MN] What are your ideas?
L:  I agree.  I agree that, um, education on, um, really what it is and what you can do to preven- -- um, you know, in the event that something like that happens is really important.
R:  Mhm.
L:  As far as what you can do to prevent it, oh, that's a hard one.  You know, it -- so many --
R:  Well, I do think that -- that our presence in the world has to be respected because, ah, the more respected we are the more unlikely we might be but some religions just look at us as the devil incarnate and they want to kill us all and [MN] -- but if we [MN] -- I don't know, I'm not for war but, [MN] I -- I'm not for -- I don't know, it's just -- [MN] it's just like, ah, if they just think they could do us any way I think we'd be more vulnerable, let me say that. [MN]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But --
L:  Well, you know, most of the people in the world are, you know, reasonable, ah --
R:  Yes, they are.
L:  -- respectful people and, you know, there's just extremist people of, you know, [MN] every religion. 
R:  I totally agree with you there.
L:  And, you know, it's those people that, you know, really make you worry.  It's not the -- it's not the average person in any country that makes you concerned.
R:  It's not even the average person that breaks in your car and steals here in this country.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Because I -- I don't even, for -- my car doesn't even lock.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It -- some- somebody broke into it before I bought it and had a little -- and I went to get it fixed and it cost too much so, we [MN] thr- -- ah, th- three doors lock and one doesn't and, like I said, nobody ever bothers anything so ... I don't leave anything to really tempt 'em, like purses or anything but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- my groceries and my little odds and ends and all.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know.  
L:  Exactly.
R:  So, you, I mean, I believe that it's true but I do believe that -- that we do [MN] -- we do need intelligence to, um, you know, and I don't believe in harassing innocent people --
L:  No.
R:  -- but I -- I do believe intelligence is necessary and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know, and [MN] --
L:  Yeah, I think intelligence is a good source, um, of, you know, how to prevent it and I think, um, you know, a lot of things come back, in my opinion, to, um, personal responsibility.  You know, people --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- being aware of what's happening in their community and their neighborhood and their family and, you know, just being aware of what's happening around them and I think a lot of that's come to light more than it was, you know, before September eleventh but --
R:  Yes, we are more aware and we are, um --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- we are -- we -- we are looking for things and I think -- I've never been exposed to any situation that I -- I thought I needed to alert somebody but I wouldn't hesitate if I were.
L:  Right.
R:  Would you?
L:  No, absolutely not. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's -- you know, I [MN] worked for a company that, um, that was considered a potential target for, um, bomb threats --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and such, um, after September eleventh and it really was interesting to see, you know, what the company did which, um, you know, trying to protect the employees --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and -- and the biggest things really --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, amounted to people being more aware of, you know, who they were letting in the building, who was around, [MN] ah --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- whether the people that were hanging around were supposed to be hanging around --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah, more than, you know, high tech this or that.  You know, it was more just people being aware and I think that that's a lot of what it's gonna have to be.  You know, unfortunately, it's really my opinion that if somebody is willing to die to hurt others or kill others or, you know, perform some act of terrorism there's really not much you can do to stop 'em.
R:  There is not much you can do, ah, you know, like you said, but -- but be aware of the normal -- the norm and if it's not, then, you know, of course, you don't want anyone to get in trouble that's innocent but still y- you have your own children and grandchildren and people to protect [MN] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so you have to, ah [MN] -- and our -- our enforcement has to be aware that, like you said, a great many people are innocent --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they, you know, I mean, there's not very many that are [MN], um, you know, are going to do it but wh- when they -- one --
L:  [NOISE] [several inaudible words] 
R:  -- one or two or three people can kill thousands ...
L:  Right.  Well, like with September eleventh, you know, people [MN] right after that when I was traveling and flying and stuff, people would be a lot more patient and courteous --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, and a lot more aware of who was around them than when I traveled before September eleventh and I think, that it's just that kind of thing, you know, whether you're at the airports or at sporting events or, you know, in a large crowd or parade or, you know, like, something, you just be aware, be more patient, um, [MN] you know, and I think people are starting to lose some of that.  You know, now when we travel people seem a little more impatient with the security --
R:  Yeah, but the --
L:  -- than they did right afterwards.
R:  [COUGH] [MN] Before September the eleventh there was rules on the airline that prevented people from getting involved in anything and they -- they changed their rules after September the eleventh to -- to encourage people to --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but they did have some rules in effect --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that would prevent people from being active in any kind of situation, so ...
L:  Right, well, and the whole -- the whole theory on how to deal with terrorists changed.  I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the -- the theory before September eleventh was always, well, you know, give in to their demands and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- no harm will come and --
R:  We'll hope that -- we'll hope that they'll be nice and they won't be -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- nice.  You know, I mean --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's not gonna happen. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Nice people don't become terrorists.  That's just --
R:  This is true. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, it's not -- not part of the profile. [LAUGH]
R:  No, it isn't, so, I mean --
L:  But ...
R:  -- it's -- it's like the United States, ah, doesn't negotiate with them.  There's not much negotiation with them unless you have something that they want, you know.  If they want --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to trade you out of some- something like, used to be, you know, terrorists would make demands and blah blah blah but now they don't do that.  It's a different -- there's a different type of terrorism.  You know, it used to be hijack a plane, give me fifty thousand dollars but [MN] ...
L:  Or the release of my --
R:  Whatever, release of somebody ...
L:  -- my -- my brothers or --
R:  Yeah.  But now it's --
L:  Right.  Now it's -- 
R:  -- not like that any more.
L:  Yeah, it seems that the terrorists now are, um, out to show their power by, you know, how much, you know, destruction and killing they can inflict on somebody --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and -- and I think, [MN] you know, as far as bio terrorism, there's -- there's so many scary things out there, um --
R:  Yeah, the bio terrorism is the scariest and I think we -- one thing we need really to -- to put in this country, we really need to -- to keep our electric, like, my husband said, and our water, safe, because if they just -- if -- if terrorists just cut off the electricity in this country or cut off the water [MN] [NOISE] we'd be just totally incapacitated.  
L:  Right.
R:  I mean --
L:  Yeah, water and electricity --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, you know, or even, not even cutting off the water but contaminating it somehow.
R:  Contaminating the water, that's basically cutting it off 'cause we couldn't use it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  My grandbaby's not real happy this moment.
L:  Oh, no.  [LAUGH]
R:  This -- tomorrow's his one year birthday and it's -- we're having a thunderstorm and the cat and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- the baby are kind of getting a little uptight about it but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah, that's why I -- I sound like --
L:  I've got -- I've got a ten month old and he doesn't like thunderstorms either. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, this one will be a year and he's -- he's a sweetie.  He was born [MN] kind of crippled but now he's all better.
L:  Oh, that's wonderful.
R:  He's not walking yet but he will be able to, [NOISE] just fine, no, I mean, you know, but -- but we're not supposed to talk about that.
L:  Right.
R:  But, anyway --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I just think that, ah, that we do want to protect these little babies and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- there's things that, you know, and I think that there should be town discussions and everybody should get together and see, you know, what could be done in our town to protect us and --
L:  Yeah, and it would be nice --
R:  -- not leave it up to the law enforcement totally and [MN] ...
L:  Right.  It'd be good to find out more information about, you know, what kind of prevention --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- or things or, you know --
R:  What's happening?  Mhm.
L:  -- can you get immunizations for certain things --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or, you know, what can you do if you, you know, do get attacked or is it just, you know, end all [MN] type of thing?  You know, because it's really, you know, most people, the ma- -- vast -- vast majority, don't have any idea what the bioterrorist, you know, agents or chemicals or --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- that kind of thing are and what they do to you or what you can do for yourself --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I think education, you know, [MN] in most things is the -- is the right answer and I think in bioterrorism I think that's a -- that's a key.
R:  Well, when I was growing up we all took a smallpox shot whether we wanted to or not.
L:  Yeah, no, they don't give 'em any more.
R:  No, they don't because there was really not any reason --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but we took 'em and we didn't like it and --
L:  No.
R:  -- and so, if, you know, it might not have been good for one hundred percent of the people but that was just what you did because that's what you did, you know. [MN]
L:  Right.
R:  So ...
L:  Then in my generation they -- they didn't --
R:  No.
L:  So, we're not --
R:  My children didn't, uh-uh.
L:  Yep, and so we're not protected against that and, you know, see one [inaudible] --
R:  We're not protected any more.  Ah -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- my age group aren't protected any more 'cause it -- it's [NOISE] gone now, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause I was, like, six years old or something and, ah, or whatever age we got 'em then and everybody got their tonsils out then too. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, things have chan- --
