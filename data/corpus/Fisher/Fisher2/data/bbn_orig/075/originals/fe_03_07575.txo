L:  Hi, there.  I'm Nancy.
R:  Hi.  I'm Brenda.  How are you?
L:  Good.  Good.  Well, I -- 
R:  What --
L:  -- I -- I picked this topic, despite the fact that I might have a lot less to say than other people.
R:  Mm.  On sports?
L:  Yes.
R:  Um, ah generally, I like basketball, but football, they can keep.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'm not a football fan.  I'm a --
L:  Well, basketball's a lot faster.
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  Well, it makes for a much more fun game, I think.  I -- I -- I'm -- I'm from a big ten school so it's hard to not watch football.
R:  Well see, I was from a small school and the only thing that we had when I was going to school was basketball.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We lived and breathed basketball.  I even played.  I didn't play my high school years.  I played when I was in junior high --
L:  Well --
R:  -- and I was team manager when I was in high school.
L:  Oh.  
R:  So I understood --
L:  Good for you.
R:  -- the game.
L:  Yes.  Yes.  Well, it's a very southern thing. 
R:  Yes.
L:  I -- I ended up going to North Carolina State and -- and it's quite the basketball oriented school, but um even very avid sports supporters would admit that the football game they played down there was kind of akin to "hurry up and win".
R:  Yeah.  Uh, I live in Texas and the Dallas Cowboys are big here.
L:  Mhm.  Yes.  That's why they're called [inaudible] I guess.
R:  Yes.  Uh and I don't mind watching figure skating or something like that on TV.  I been to some ice shows, but uh I'm not a big sports fan.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Basketball, I can deal with.  
L:  It's hard to resist the Olympics.
R:  Well, I do -- I do, too.  I don't ever watch them too much.  My husband's a sports fanatic.  He always got it on a baseball game or football or something.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  But uh, I'm just the opposite.  I like --
L:  Well, what --
R:  -- basketball.  That's the only thing I watch.  
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  What do you --
L:  Well, what --
R:  What else -- what other kinda stuff -- sports -- what do you really like to watch?
L:  Well um, be- because where I'm from, I'm much more fond of hockey, which again is a nice, fast game like basketball.  
R:  I been to -- have you ever been to a hockey game in person?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  See, I haven't.  I bet that's --
L:  [NOISE].
R:  -- something good to -- something fun to watch, though?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Within that they're moving on the floor and all that stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Constantly after that puck and everything.
L:  Yes.
R:  Looks like it'd be interesting.
L:  Well, it -- it compares to some kind of combination between soccer and basketball.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Um, you -- 'cause you got a goalie, just like --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- soccer, um but, everyone is moving.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  I bet that's something to see, though.  Hockey.  'Cause I've never -- see I've been to see the Dallas Mavericks play basketball three or four times.  
L:  Mhm.  
R:  And every time I've gone to see them play, of course they got -- they've gotten beat.  But --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- they're -- they've got to get a team going and -- and I like --
L:  I'm wondering -- I'm --
R:  Go ahead?
L:  -- wondering how you cope when your husband's watching games incessantly?
R:  Well, I -- we've kinda got our own little uh deal, so that we've got cable, uh, we've got the dish network, we've got a den, his -- but when we had the den fixed up, that was for him.  He's got his TV --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- up there, he watches sport.  I therefore got a -- got an extra [inaudible] TV put in my bedroom.  Ah, we got an extended uh -- we got the cable -- a separate cable box and I can watch what I want.
L:  Mm.
R:  So on weekends when he's tied up with sport, I'm back there, um, either in my bedroom or in my office on the computer or something.
L:  Mm.
R:  We've worked out something between us, I guess, where -- 'cause we spend time together and we do our own thing, and we have our time to decide for each other.
L:  Mm.
R:  And it seems to be working.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  Yeah.  And right now he's working six days a week so he's not at home very much except on Sunday.
L:  Mhm.  Mm.  Maybe he needs that veg out time?
R:  Yeah.  This -- so this is their rest.  On the day he likes to watch sports and stuff.  
L:  Well, I -- I don't think we're gonna get rid of it any time soon, but it's just important for guys to keep up that way, just 'cause it -- it's part of their guy language.
R:  Well, now about -- uh, the school he went to and graduated from, uh, one state the last two years in a row with football and they made it to the finals again this year.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  So they've got a really good football team, and I always listen to those games with him on the radio and stuff because I got -- well, I got into it when -- you know, from the kids and all that stuff, I guess, them playing for the uh team and everything, but uh we listen to all the playoff games and stuff together.
L:  Mm.  
R:  So I did it more or less for him.
L:  Yes.  
R:  'Cause I don't understand all that stuff about football.  But if I watch it with him and all, I ask him questions because he used to play football when he was at high school.  I guess that's why he's such a -- and he likes baseball too, so I used to play softball a long time ago, but I don't pay as much attention to it as I used to.
L:  Well, softball is such a social game.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  You know, just -- it --
R:  They say it's more for a female game, too.  
L:  Yeah.  Well, it -- it -- well, it is -- it is much more co opportunity, because you can play a mixed game with men and women and --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you know, it's -- between that and volleyball, it's -- it's a great thing for -- for um, you know, church groups and whatnot.
R:  Did you ever play sports in school?
L:  Me?  No, really.  Um, I -- I call myself projectile sports impaired.
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  [LAUGH].  I -- I have uh pretty bad nearsightedness.
R:  Oh, so you --
L:  So I -- I -- I did a little track and field and I can do long distance running and -- I don't know --
R:  I have to wear glasses and stuff to read.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, I had to wear glasses at -- well, I -- my high school years, I got out of my glasses.  I didn't ever ha- for some reason, this my -- you know, the right eye straightened up, but --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- as how I was in the ninth grade, the doctor pulled me on my glasses and I didn't have to have them again until about two years ago.  
L:  Oh.  
R:  So.
L:  Lucky you.  
R:  But I had -- by the time I hit my mid -- hit my thirties, I had to have them back.  
L:  Mhm.  
R:  And I've got bifocals now because I can't --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- read anything without 'em.
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  I mean, I can read the big letters [several inaudible words] stuff like that, because, you know, the computer, you're reading, or reading on a book or a newspaper, I have to make sure I have my bifocals on.  'Cause everything's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just like a little blob.
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH].  Yeah.  I -- I know about that.  I was just talking to someone yesterday about me and swimming --
R:  Yeah?
L:  [NOISE] has a lovely pool and is probably as nearsighted as I am and wears her -- her goggles with her -- her um --
R:  My goodness.
L:  -- um contacts, and a lot of people are afraid to do that and she just goes ahead, 'cause she gets the disposable ones anyway.  Um, but I -- I realized, you know, pretty well that I always had a great diff- um -- with -- without doing the inevitable, but then I went on a -- a really beautiful trip and I got a [NOISE] seemed to be very interesting tropical fish under the water, but you know, I couldn't see them without my glasses on.
R:  You not like goggles?
L:  Um, that's -- that's darned eliminating.  [LAUGH].  You know, that's enough to -- to make you wanna give up on watching Jacques Cousteau, you know?  He -- he -- if you can't enjoy the same things everyone else can.
R:  Well, just like me.  If I was to go to a ballgame right now and have to sit behind the top of the grandstand or something, I'd have to have my glasses on to see the game going on and to keep up with signs that's going on below me, or have a pair of binoculars.  
L:  Mhm.  
R:  Uh but uh --
L:  It's awful nice when those guys have their field glasses out there.
R:  Oh, yes.  And football, the reason I guess I don't like football is too much of a contact sport.  And too many people -- I've seen too many guys get hurt.
L:  Yes.  And --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- I -- I -- I'm sired -- tired of all the commercialization myself.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I went to one professional hockey team here, um, playing and um their bus was late by over an hour, so the game was delayed by over an hour and then there was just every last commercial during the game.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And we all get to see them on the screen.  You know?  And we're sitting in the bleachers and it's, you know, not entirely impossible for them to just broadcast those on TV and leave us alone, but the worst of it was about a five or ten minute um commercial by Microsoft that came off much more like a testimonial at Sunday night services than -- than an actual commercial.
R:  Yeah.  Uh, 'cause just like there in the Super Bowl games and stuff, they have, during halftime and stuff, they have all these new commercials coming in that they're doing and all that stuff, that they bring in all that stuff and there's a lot of uh stuff going on and that's how to me football drags out.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Especially running down that clock.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It may take twenty minutes to play uh two minutes of the game.  
L:  Yes.  
R:  And it's kind of --
L:  Crazy making.
R:  Yeah.  Three hours for a ball game.  That's basically what it runs.  I sit there one day with my husband, we're trying to -- well, I sit there with him, would I watch one, and uh 'cause he'd been real busy that week and we didn't get to see each other very much and uh I sit there --
