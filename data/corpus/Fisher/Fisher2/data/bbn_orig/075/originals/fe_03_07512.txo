R:  I'm Brittany Latta[?].
L:  Hi, I'm Juska[?].  How're you doing?
R:  Fine.  How are you?
L:  Good, good, thanks.
R:  That's good.
L:  [MN] So, the topic is, ah, bioterrorism. [MN]
R:  Yep.
L:  Right.  Okay.  What do you think about that?
R:  I don't know.  I think it's definitely a problem.
L:  Yeah, w- -- I think that the more that we advance science we get a whole lot more benefits and a lot of doors open but at the same time there's a whole lot of different, um, [inaudible] consequences that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- people can always abuse new technology, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so scary.  [MN] Do you -- how do you think the government should, ah, try to prevent it?
R:  I really think there is no way of prevent- prevent that from happening.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  [MN]
L:  Well, any precautions we should take or ...?
R:  More vaccinations, I guess.
L:  More vaccinations, yeah.  Um, do you think we should, um, try to have any ty- -- is there -- I don't even know much about it.  Is there much defence we can take?
R:  I have no idea.
L:  Right.  Um, [MN] yeah.  I don't have a whole lot of -- of knowledge on the subject to begin with, ah --
R:  No, me either.
L:  [MN] what do you -- wh- what do you think they should do if, ah, we had an attack?
R:  Quarantine, I [inaudible].
L:  Ahah.
R:  I -- I really have no idea.
L:  Okay.  Um, [LIPSMACK] yeah, I don't know what exactly we should do.  I -- I guess, try to have some type of -- I -- I don't really know, put some system in place, try to maybe get, um, maybe spend some time with our intelligence agency trying to track and figure out who has these --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- weapons.
R:  Yes, it's, like, what -- what are you supposed to do to prevent -- to prevent against a disease like that?
L:  To prevent against them?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] Um, well, by having, you know, a while back we used to have CIA and intelligence agencies --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- kind of monitor these, ah, terrorists and then we were the tests in law[?] which I guess they recently repealed about not being able to go in and -- and do anything about it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, um, I guess we should just try to put more effort monitoring it and, um, kinda figure out, instead of just terrorists, more so scientists and people who have knowledge of that who are buying these types of materials, large quantities of certain, um [inaudible] -- certain materials that go into making them --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I guess.
R:  Yeah, ah, like wh- what would happen if, um, if, um, some country released small pox onto the United States?
L:  [MN] Well, [LAUGH] we'd get spots.  No, um, [MN] I don't -- I don't really know.  Ah, I guess, I guess we'd have to -- I -- w- -- I don't know that much about smallpox.  Is there a vaccination against that or ...?
R:  Yeah, yeah, there's a vaccination against it but, um, [MN] most kids -- most -- most children in the US have been vaccinated against it.  The only -- only people, I believe, about like their fifties or sixties haven't been vaccinated against smallpox.
L:  Well, I don't think it should ever be a requirement to make your kids get a vaccination like that but I think --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that it should be an option and, you know, it's a thing parents could choose to do it if they'd like to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I'm sure most -- and you could advise that they do it and I'm sure a lot of parents would.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um, I don't know.  I kind of want to go get a smallpox vaccination.
R:  [MN]
L:  Um, I guess maybe some type of, um, advice for everyday people about, if that were to happen, what -- what you should do, kind of like if you think back to the Cold War in the fifties when, ah --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, they had the [inaudible] cover and, of course, stuff that would never work but --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- we're a lot more advanced now and maybe just, ah, something -- some tips of what to do if something happened, where to go, how to protect yourself.  
R:  Yeah, l- look at the cash that was unleashed by SARS.  Now, imag- -- now imagine if, like, um, Ebola or something like -- like that was released on the country.
L:  I'm sorry, y- -- ah, you're breaking up.  I didn't hear that last thing.
R:  I -- I said, um, [LIPSMACK] ah, what about -- y- y- you heard about the SARS, right?
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
R:  See -- see what happened just from that?  Now, imagine what would happen if, um, like Ebola or something like smallpox or [MN] or something like that was released on the country.  Then we'd --
L:  Right.
R:  -- be in big trouble.
L:  Yeah, we would definitely be in big trouble. [MN] I don't know. [MN] It's like [inaudible] saying that it's inevitable 'cause I don't -- you know, it's always been a threat.
L:  It's just --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- more advanced now and it's not exactly been a major concern before --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, it's -- I think it might be --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- a big scare tactic but I think it's a good thing to at least always be aware of what's going on.  Yeah.
R:  I -- I wouldn't think that other countries would be that cruel.
L:  Right.  Um, I don't think they would either but you never know. [MN]
R:  And there's al- -- and there's always the chance that it could spread to their country.
L:  Yeah.  Right, because then once you do something like that people are going to travel.  People travel all the time and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, just doing it is basically, you know, [MN] endangering yourself too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- I don't -- but, you know, there are some strange people out there who aren't, who don't think rationally, so ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, we can't really predict what's gonna happen.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, [MN] but, [NOISE] um, what do you think we should do in terms of, um, do you think that -- that we should develop any -- well, obviously we shouldn't develop any weapons, any type of -- maybe put some funding or some, um, science and technology into developing more types of new defenses against old diseases or new diseases that we don't know about?
R:  Yeah, s- something like that.  I -- I've -- yeah, I'm really not educated in any -- any parts of that or anything like that so I really -- I don't have much to say about it.
L:  Yeah.  I'm not either actually, ah, but, ah, thanks, ah, it doesn't worry me that much [inaudible].
R:  Yeah.  It's not a big -- i- it's a -- it's a threat but not -- not a big one.
L:  Yeah.  Um, I hope that -- that it's not inevitable. [MN]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, just for our sake, um, [LIPSMACK] but, um --
R:  -- [COUGH]
L:  -- I don't really know.
R:  I- it's still -- it's still something weird to think about though.
L:  Yeah, yeah, and definitely we should pay more attention to bigger threats instead of our everyday lives.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Things like that and what we would do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um ... I don't really know.  Oh [NOISE], ah, yeah. [MN]
R:  [MN] I -- I -- I used to think about that a long time ago, about what would happen if someone -- if -- if that would happen -- that -- that a -- that a disease would be spread, like, released over the US or something like that.  What would be the co- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what would be the -- what would be the reaction?
L:  Yeah, it's kind of like, um, I remember when, you know, on nine eleven --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- turning on the TV and [MN], you know, everyone was just so freaked out and no one knew, you know, that's a thing you don't think about every day, getting attacked --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- by foreign people and it's -- it's just another type of terrorist attack and it's just as scary and it's just people [MN] don't think about it every day.  They think it's, oh, well, we're not --we're not [NOISE] -- it's not going to happen to us.  The same thing happens with a lot of, um, other worries people have.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, like, oh, well, it's not my concern.  It's something that happens to other people, but --
R:  Mm.
L:  You just don't [several inaudible words].
R:  Pe- people just don't realise the danger.
L:  Right. [NOISE]  There definitely is danger there. [NOISE] Um, but ... [NOISE] They have -- they even have classes on it.  I'm in College --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they have bioterrorism classes that they offer, ah, ah, in, just like, um, you know, political science.  I've never taken one --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- but my friends have taken one, and [MN] yeah, they say it's really creepy and scary and makes 'em kind of paranoid about it all but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I guess that, um, being aware of it is a good thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And educated about it.
R:  Yeah, I'd -- I'd say though that for some people not knowing it could be a good thing 'cause a lot of people could tell you, like, um, like, a little bit too far, really pa- -- really paranoid about it.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I guess so, but they could probably do that with anything.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um ...
R:  [COUGH]
L:  Um ... 
R:  [MN]
L:  Um ...
R:  Yeah, I don't -- I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's so- -- it's just something a little weird to talk about.
L:  Right.  It's not something you --
R:  Yeah, it's not everyday conversation.
L:  -- bring up in casual conversation.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, hey, at a party, let's talk about, ah, bioterrorism.
R:  [MN]
L:  No, it's not -- 'cause people don't want to talk about negative things [inaudible].
R:  [MN] [NOISE] Yep.
L:  Yeah.  Um, have you ever -- has it come up for you before? 
R:  [MN]
L:  Like, it's just -- [MN]
R:  Not much.
L:  No?
R:  No.
L:  No, me neither.  Um, you know, I'm -- I'm in --
