L:  Hi.  I am Sam.
R:  Sam?  
L:  Yes.  S.A.M.
R:  May name is Caitlin Dry.
L:  Caitlin?
R:  Do you have a last name?
L:  Smith.
R:  I think your mother must of given you some last name.  I guess it's better not to give us our real names.  Is that what we're allowed -- not allowed to do?
L:  I think, um, they said to choose a nickname to use.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  Which --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- my nickname truly is Sam.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Huh, it really is.
R:  That's okay.  Ah -- 
L:  Did you say your name was Caitlin?
R:  Mm.  Kate.  Yeah.
L:  Kate?  Yeah, Kate.  Um, so we're supposed to talk about bioterrorism.
R:  Right.  Which is practically impossible to do if -- at any level.  You know, realistically speaking.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Unless I just cancel all um -- just decide that anything chemical should be eliminated.  I mean, any -- you know what I mean?
L:  Well, yeah.  But my thought is, if they --
R:  Of course, that'd be real impossible.  Like Newark, New Jersey.  You know, all they'd have to do is -- I mean, I don't even want to talk about it, 'cause it's too scary, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's what [LAUGH] I'm really --
L:  Well, you know, my thought is, how can we control it in any way?
R:  Just the way we have been.  I don't think -- 
L:  [NOISE].
R:  -- we should do anything else, really.  I don't think --
L:  [NOISE].
R:  -- we should do -- 
L:  Go ask grandma.  Go -- 
R:  You like, like -- 
L:  Go ask grandma.
R:  Like -- 
L:  Go ask grandma.
R:  -- how all those airports, like, to have that whole stick at the airport, like, not being able to put my luggage on when I go to the airport.  You know, just give it to somebody, go into the concourse, get on the plane and fly.  It's the most unbearable thing I could possibly think about.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  You know, and to have to wait in line and you almost miss your plane and then it's just totally insane in there now.  And they ruin the entire airline.  They just -- it was like some horrible -- you know, and they didn't have to go to that lengths, because when you're thirty thousand -- where are you from?
L:  Colorado.
R:  Thirty thousand people in this state lost their jobs at Boeing.  Now, if that isn't --
L:  Where are you from?  
R:  I'm in Seattle, Washington.
L:  Are you in Seattle?  I lived in Seattle for seven years.
R:  Thirty thousand people lost their jobs.  Just a couple --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- weeks ago.  If that isn't a more -- that's like a bigger disaster than anything we could ever possibly imagine.
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  You know?
L:  I mean, all the repercussions from --
R:  Oh, God --
L:  -- this whole thing is --
R:  -- they're so out --
L:  -- just --
R:  -- of control.  
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  So out of control.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm not -- there's nothing -- I personally feel that it's wag the dog, that they -- someone said that they had to -- that the big heads of state decided that there had to be some kind of catastrophe in order for them to go into -- you know, Iraq and take out the leader.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  I don't know.  I -- I st- I mean, I don't --
L:  Well --
R:  -- know where they got, you know, the videotapes of these guys with long beards, you know, and some guy who was blind in New Jersey, you know, like did all those bombings the first time in the eighties, to the --
L:   Yeah.
R:   -- World Trade Center.  Who knew?  You know?  From what?
L:   Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
R:   It just never makes any sense, you know?
L:   Yeah.  Well, and I just think, okay, whatever we tell the United Nations, you know, we come to agreement, everybody signs an agreement saying, "We're not going to use this -- this type of weapon, we're not going to do this".
R:   Right.  That's the --
L:   And it's like -- yeah.
R:   That's it.  
L:   But, no.  I mean, my thought is, it's not gonna happen.  No matter what they sign --
R:   Oh, yeah.  I know.
L:   -- a signature doesn't mean a thing to a terrorist.
R:   Yeah.  That --
L:   You know, if --
R:   You know, you watch -- you see what happens in the Palestinian people and you know -- you know, it doesn't matter.  You know, there you go.  That's -- that's example.
L:   Yeah.  Oh, yeah.
R:   True, you know?
L:   Yeah, I mean, it's --
R:   It -- it just doesn't matter.  It's some guys can walk into Oklahoma with minora -- minora -- I mean, tomanore[?] or whatever they made that bomb out of --
L:   Yeah.
R:   -- you know what I mean?
L:   Yeah, I mean --
R:   Well, I mean, if ki- 
L:   And if we stop them from using this or that, they're gonna come up with something else.
R:   Yeah.  I'm sure.  I mean, I walked out of chemistry lab because it was too weird for me to deal with, you know?  [LAUGH].  I'm not gonna --
L:   Yeah.
R:   -- messing ch- mixing chemicals together 'cause I'm like totally freaked by it, you know?
L:   Oh, yeah.  
R:   So um it just -- this did -- you know, I just think we should forget about it.  We're so lucky.  There are six billion people or seven billion people on the planet.  We're so lucky that there's so little problems that, you know, it's not even worth mentioning, you know?
L:   Yeah.
R:   There were more hijackings in the eighties, I don't know if you were born then --
L:   Oh, yeah.
R:   -- but there were more hijackings than there are -- you know, and deaths from a whole lot of other things and just --
L:   Yeah.
R:   You know?
L:   Well --
R:   I mean, it is horrifying.  I mean, it's just --
L:   Yeah.
R:   -- beyond anything anybody --
L:   Yeah.  Right.
R:   -- would ever imagined happening, you know?
L:   Right.  But --
R:   But, hell, it's not worth --
L:   -- I mean --
R:   -- getting uptight about.  It's not worth hiring every foreigner in the entire world to come over here to our country and work at -- you know, in the -- in the airports, taking away cuticle scissors and razors and -- if they walk on with box cutters, you know what I mean?
L:   What's that?
R:   If they can walk on with box cutters --
L:   Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
R:   And -- and -- and -- and not be subverted.  I mean, they say couldn't -- the girls couldn't throw a -- a cart down the aisle?  The guys couldn't pick up a computer, their computers, and smash them over the head?  Attack them? 
L:   Yeah.  Yeah.
R:   They couldn't pick the pillows up and throw them en masse?
L:   Yeah.
R:   And throw them off balance?
L:   Good point, yeah.
R:   The guys in the back couldn't, like, you know -- or the doors.  They couldn't of pulled -- couldn't just open the doors and smash them?  In their face?
L:   Yeah.  Yeah.
R:   Or the pilot li- you know?  And it's so weird, you think about this.  You know how all the hijackings went on and everything?
L:   Mhm?  
R:   How would you feel if you were a pilot, just think about this.  If you were a pilot, wouldn't you want to, like, have a protection against someone coming in your airplane? 
L:   Yeah.
R:   You know --
L:   Yeah.
R:   -- holy shit, and all they have to do is have stun guns.  They don't even have to have bullets in them.  
L:   That's true.
R:   You know, and there's -- people could be -- you know, there should be proper locks on the doors and then stun guns.  
L:   Yeah.  Yeah.
R:   I mean, God.  They could of knocked them all out with stun guns.
L:   Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.
R:   All the hostesses --
L:   Yeah, and -- yeah.
R:   -- should be armed.
L:   Stop them enough and then --
R:   And then just -- that's it.  They just -- 
L:   Take care of it from there, yeah.
R:   Yeah, you know?  Bring on --
L:   Yeah.
R:   When they get to the next airport or, you know, handcuff them.  They could have handcuffs on the plane.
L:   Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, and I'm sure --
R:   You know?
L:   -- passengers would gladly jump in and help.  I mean, once they stunned them --
R:   Yeah.  Right.
L:   You know, a passenger could safely --
R:   Exactly.  I think they're --
L:   -- get up and --
R:   Right.  And I think they were so stunned and nobody even, like, could say anything, you know?
L:   Yeah.  
R:   I don't know.
L:   If -- yeah.
R:   If I were in the plane, you know, and somebody was -- didn't have a gun in their hand and they were standing there within -- with a Exacto knife in their hand --
L:   Mm.  
R:   -- I think I would of picked up a computer and thrown it at their face.
L:   Yeah.
R:   Don't you?
L:   Well, if you knew you were going to die anyway, why not?  Yeah.
R:   Yeah, what the hell?   You know?
L:   Yes, what's the worst that could happen?
R:   Jesus -- 
L:   Yeah, that's true.
R:   And how --
L:   Good point.
R:   -- are they gonna get the plane to go down anyway?  Well, I guess they were already in the seats.  I guess it must of happened so quickly that they must of just -- I guess --
L:   Well, if they've planned it --
R:   -- just overtook the pilot, but then how -- did they -- what'd they do?  Slit their throats?  You know --
L:   Could be.
R:   -- we don't know --
L:   Well, if they planned it correctly, yeah.
R:   I guess --
L:   I mean --
R:   I guess it's --
L:   -- three of them were on the -- in the -- in the cockpit and took over, you know, immediately --
R:   Right.
L:   -- all at once.
R:   Right.
L:   I mean, it probably wasn't one at a time, silently.
R:   I see.  So -- yeah, right.
L:   You know?
R:   Right.
L:   But I mean, who knows?
R:   But there -- there's only -- there's two pilots and like --
L:   Yeah, but that's what I'm saying --
R:   -- I -- I know, but --
L:   -- if three terrorists were in the --
R:   I know.  With Exacto knives, coming at you, I guess I wouldn't do too much either, you know? 
L:   Yeah.
R:   What would you do?  You just --
L:   I mean, and once the --
R:   -- back off and let them --
L:   Yeah.
R:   But then --
L:   If they snuck up behind them --
R:   But then why couldn't --
L:   Yeah --
R:   Why wouldn't -- when they were in there -- oh yeah, three.  So one's guarding the two pilots and the others are sitting in their seats.
L:   Yeah.  
R:   So you couldn't really --
L:   Yeah.
R:   So the pilots really couldn't, unless they were really clever and -- and just went to the back of their knees or went to their knees and cro- you know?
L:   Well, I know it would -- I mean --
R:   I don't know.
L:   -- it would take a lot.  If --
R:   If I was a -- I would of done anything to -- I don't know --
L:   Yeah.
R:   -- what I would of done.
L:   Well, and one of them did.  I mean, they saved that one plane from going into the -- I mean, but they crashed it either way, but --
R:   Yeah.  
L:   -- they saved it from going into the White House.
R:   So strange to think about that, it's such a -- it's such a weird thing.  It's so weird I can't even imagine it.  You know, I just can't imagine it.  It's just -- it's really hard to fathom it.  It really is.
L:   Yeah.  
R:   Just so strange to think that all those things that have happened and with guys with Exacto knives.  
L:   I know.  I know.
R:   It's like -- not like --
L:   Well --
R:   -- they're a dangerous weapon.
L:   Now, how do we know that there wasn't more, though?
R:   Yeah.  Really.  You know?
L:   I mean --
R:   Honestly.
L:   Yeah.  They say that that's all there was, but --
R:   But how -- who had it -- how do they know?  I mean, did the people get on their cell phones and tell everybody?  That they were have -- having --
L:   Actually, you know, I don't know that, but yeah.  I mean, you know that people called other people and said -- you know, called their relatives --
R:   Yeah, my -- the --
L:   -- or whatever --
R:   -- worrying that my plane is --
L:   -- and said this is what's happening.
R:   You know?  This is my final words.
L:   Is that where we got all the information?
R:   [SIGH].
L:   Or did they find remnants of Exacto knives?  I mean, how did they know?
R:   God.  No, I don't think they found any remnants because they were all -- they said everything was that way, right?  Everything was -- the whole thing was done that way.  Isn't that what they said?
L:   Yeah.  But did they get that, like, from documentation that they found from the --
R:   I don't know, but --
L:   -- terrorists themselves?  Or was it from -- was it from -- like --
R:   I don't know.
L:   -- did the cell phone calls --
R:   You know, I really don't know.
L:   And how do we know the details?
R:   But I -- I tell you, you know, the -- the -- it -- bits and pieces and the places that they chose to -- you know, to um --
L:   Yeah.
R:   -- blitz, you know, afterwards?
L:   Yeah.
R:   Those are really weird.  It's just strange.  I mean, I --
L:   It was well planned, that's for sure.
R:   Yeah.  
L:   I mean, it was well planned.
R:   Yeah, and whoever the airheads are that work for the government, who then again did something -- 
L:   [MN].
R:   -- really weird --
L:   Oh, yeah.
R:   -- and improper, you know?
L:   Yes.  
R:   Some guy or --
L:   Oh.
R:   I don't know, there's some -- and then that weird girl from China who is a double agent and all those kind of people?
L:   Yeah.  Yeah.
R:   But um, you know, where are you in Colorado?
L:   Um, Pueblo.  We're --
R:   Pueblo?  Oh, yeah.  I love --
L:   It's --
R:   -- that Mexican restaurant there on the main street.
L:   Oh, really?
R:   [LAUGH].  In nineteen sixty six --
L:   That -- where are you in Seattle?
R:   -- I went into that restaurant and I had a --
