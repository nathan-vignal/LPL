R:  All right.
L:  This is interesting.  I never did this before.
R:  No, I haven't either, so I guess we'll both --
L:  I --
R:  -- both feel our way through this.
L:  Yeah.  My husband saw this on the computer, I guess, and -- how did you --
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  How did you find out about it?
R:  Oh, on the computer, yes.
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, so we're supposed to talk about sports?
L:  Sports.
R:  On T -- TV sports.  
L:  Mm.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Baseball.  Huh.
R:  Yeah, that's a good one.
L:  Tennis.
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.  
L:  How about ice skating?
R:  Well, that's a sport also, yeah.  So, you can start --
L:  I don't --
R:  You wish that I start --
L:  I don't -- um.  I don't really watch many sports.  I like figure skating.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  Well, I guess that would be considered a sport.  I mean, it's a uh -- yeah, I'm sure it would be, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I guess -- talk about --
L:  What do you like?
R:  Oh well, I like baseball.
L:  Oh.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  Okay.
R:  Uh, basketball, although when my children were in school --
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  -- they -- well, in high school, they participated in basketball games and so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that got me interested, uh, in following up the uh the games and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- watching the guys play.
L:  Right.
R:  And so, yeah.  
L:  Oh, that's interesting.
R:  Yeah.  Got me interested in that.  
L:  Ah --
R:  Mm.  So um -- what about you --
L:  How about gymnastics?  Or and uh --
R:  Well -- well, I'm -- I watch it, you know?  It's -- it's interesting, but I don't know too much about it, that I can --
L:  Right.
R:  -- uh follow it.  Um, you said you like, ah, ice skating?  You said the figure skating?
L:  Yeah, figure skating I like to watch.  I don't know -- I just like to watch it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's -- I don't -- I don't watch that many sports, that's the thing.  I don't know much about -- I mean, sometimes, like basketball, I'll just put it on or --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Well, I -- I li-
L:  Baseball or --
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, well, like -- like I said, I ah, I don't follow them all of the time because I do um root for the Oriels in baseball --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- most of -- uh, all of the time, 'cause they're the --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- closest home team in -- right here in Maryland.
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  Yeah.  So um --
L:  I got the Philadelphia Phillies.  
R:  Yeah.  Right.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.  They're good too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But a lot of times, I -- I root for the winning team.  [LAUGH].
L:  Right.
R:  Which is -- say, okay, they're good.  They're coming on, so I'm sort of fickle, um, a lot of times, but for the most part, um, I uh just root for them, they're the home team, the -- the Oriels, and they're going --
L:  Ah --
R:  -- going pretty good.  I don't complain about them.  Um, usually in the beginning of the games, they usually uh, you know, start out all of the time being winners and sort of they sort of slack off it seems like.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  Um, in the middle part, they get in a rut, but then they pull out and uh so for -- for the most part, they do pretty good.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, um -- and uh, a few years back it was pretty bad.  Pretty bad.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Everybody was upset with the birds.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But uh, yeah, you just can't win them all so uh --
L:  Right.  How about swimming?
R:  Um, yeah.
L:  That's a good sport.  That's interest-
R:  Though swimming, well, I'm not a swimmer.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So -- uh, do you like swimming?
L:  I like to swim sometimes, yeah.  I go to the beach a lot and --
R:  Oh, oh yeah.  That's right --
L:  -- and the pool.
R:  -- Florida, you're um right near the water all of the time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm.
L:  Then when I'm in Pennsylvania  I like the New Jersey shore, I go there a lot.  I'll be going there soon, in July.
R:  Oh, yeah --
L:  So -- I love Ma- uh, Maryland, well, Ocean City.  You ever go to Ocean City, Maryland?
R:  Uh, yes.  I have been there.  Mhm.  
L:  [NOISE].  Uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Okay, Stephanie.  The balloon got caught in the fan.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Disaster.
L:  It's okay.  
R:  [MN].  
L:  [LAUGH].  It's okay, Steffie. 
R:  So you come up this way quite often, to the --
L:  Um, no.  From -- no, I haven't -- I haven't been there for a while, but I want to go.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'd love to go this summer again, you know?  I love Ocean City, Maryland.
R:  Yeah.  So what --
L:  Swimming and that.  Do -- are you -- do you live around there?
R:  Uh, no.  I'm quite a distance from um -- from there.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, it's about uh -- ooh, four hour drive from where I live --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- to -- to Ocean City.  Have to go across the Chastity[?] Bay Bridge and all of that.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  To get to there.  So I -- do you like swimming in deep water?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or -- oh. 
L:  Yeah, that don't -- that doesn't bother me.  I li- 
R:  Oh, you're just --
L:  I mean, not like deep -- well, I mean, I could go -- like, if I go out on a boat and jump off the boat in the ocean, I don't stay out there too long 'cause I don't -- you -- you get kinda scared -- or I get kinda scared, where you don't know if there's sharks or -- you know --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- what's out in the middle of the ocean.  [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.  Oh, so you -- you do that?  You go out and uh -- and jump off uh --
L:  Yeah, I've done that before.  
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  That's fun.
R:  Ah, it sounds int-
L:  I like that.
R:  It sounds interesting, yeah.
L:  Yeah, and then go on the boat and take a boat ride [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  Now, that's a good -- a good uh sport.  Swimming and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- fishing?  Do you do fishing while you're --
L:  Fishing.
R:  -- out uh --
L:  Um, no, I haven't been fishing --
R:  No, you don't?
L:  -- since I was a little girl, actually, but uh --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- did you ever do fishing for a while?
R:  Not recently.  No.  But um --
L:  No.  
R:  -- I used to, years ago, but I haven't gone in several years, fishing.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And as far as swimming, uh-huh --
L:  That's an interesting sport, fishing.
R:  Oh, yeah. 
L:  I watch it on TV sometimes and the men and women, they catch all these fish.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  They do.  Sometimes it's amazing at how they have to reel those big ones in.  Yeah, it almost looks like there's -- they're about to pulled in -- into the water.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  No, and --
L:  Interesting.  Huh.  
R:  Mhm.  So uh --
L:  Do you have any children that have any kinda sports or do practice any kind of sports or --
R:  Oh, well, no.  My children are all grown now.
L:  Oh.
R:  But like I said, when they were younger, uh, they were into basketball mostly.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Well, my son played soccer --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- for a few years, but uh, that's uh -- a dangerous game.  He's ah forever getting injured and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- knees and -- and thighs bruised up and all of that, but he liked it, but I just --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- didn't go for that too much because there was too much injury, uh --
L:  Right.
R:  Well, in uh playing soccer, getting kicked and all that.
L:  Mm.  
R:  That, uh, of course, with basketball, they could get injured too, or -- elbows in the face and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and all of -- all of that.
L:  Mm.
R:  But, mm, they enjoyed it and I got, you know, after attending so many games, I -- I was in with the group.  [LAUGH].  I started enjoying basketball too.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So uh, but uh I did -- didn't play any.  Did you play basketball?  Do you play basketball at all?
L:  Well, when I was in high school and stuff --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we played basketball.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  My daughter loves sports.  She's in uh gymnastics like uh every Saturday.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Like, acrobatics.  They even moved her up a class, and she always gets, like, these calluses on her hands.  Well, I guess they all do.  The teacher said you see 'em.
R:  Yeah, swinging --
L:  'Cause they go round the bar, but she really loves that.
R:  Oh.  
L:  And swimming.  She loves to swim and --
R:  Oh, well, that's --
L:  She uh loves to play ball.
R:  Well, just athletic all the way around, huh?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Isn't she?  [LAUGH].
L:  She's only six.
R:  Oh, wow.  So she's starting out early, so she'll probably be some kind of a professional athlete uh --
L:  Oh, that'd be nice.  Sure.
R:  Yeah.
L:  She's really great at gymnastics.  
R:  Mm.  Mhm.  That's good.   Mm.
L:  She's better than the boys.  Like, on the monkey bars.
R:  Oh.
L:  She can -- she gets on the monkey bars and she really goes and goes and some of the boys can't keep up with her.
R:  Ah, she could outdo the boys on the monkey bars, mm?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Mm.  Well, she might turn out to be a professional athlete, yeah and  -- 
L:  Yeah, that'd be nice.
R:  -- be making all kinds of money.
L:  You never know.
R:  Yeah.  Because uh --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- athletes make money these -- these days and --
L:  Right. 
R:  I don't know --
L:  A lot of work, to work out and --
R:  Oh, yeah, it surely is.  Because I mean, when you're watching them, it looks so easy.  
L:  But it's not.
R:  But no, it -- it's a lot of work, um, that they have to put in to it.  And sacrifices and -- for, you know, going from -- moving from place to place.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Just --
L:  All kinds of things.
R:  Yeah.  Just when they get settled in -- in one area, they're either transferred to a -- another team or something, and moves happen, re- relocate to another area.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So um --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- they make good money, but uh -- 
L:  Right.  
R:  -- they -- they're -- they earn some of it, I will --
L:  Right.
R:  -- wouldn't -- don't -- wouldn't say that they earn as much as they make, but --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- they probably do, like, 'cause they really -- 
L:  Huh.
R:  Can't say because they -- and they -- it's um --
L:  Interest-
R:  -- they don't really clear all of the money that they do make because they have all kinds of managers and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and insurances and things to um --
