L:  Hi.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.  Our subject is, what do you think our country can do to prevent bioterrorism?
R:  That's correct.
L:  A weighty subject.
R:  Yes, very much so.
L:  I don't, ah, I -- I wish I had the technical background, ah, or the historic background to, ah, ah, to be able to cast any light on it but I really don't.
R:  [MN] No, I really don't either.  I just know that our CDC is working hard every day to try to prevent such a thing.
L:  The Centers for Disease Control?
R:  Correct.
L:  [MN] Oh, well, are they able to do it, ah, more than, ah, detection, ah, by our intelligence agencies?
R:  I don't know if they can do it more so but I think the communication between them probably helps.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think they could tell our intelligence agencies what to look for, things like that.
L:  [MN] But doesn't it -- doesn't it sort of chill you to think that bioterrorism could be executed just by one person carrying in something in a little suitcase.  
R:  [MN]
L:  This is --
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  This is what, ah, but I think our subject is what can our country do and all that I can think of is to have our citizenry on the alert.  Ah, I sort of don't move in circles where I s- -- w- would ordinarily see people whom I would suspect of, um, of being bioterrorists.
R:  Yeah, but --
L:  Do you?
R:  -- it's hard to know.  [MN]  You know, it could be the person next door.
L:  I don't think so, but [MN] but maybe the person on a bus or maybe in a crowd or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- at an open -- at an open gathering.  I think maybe something like that, you know, like at a rock concert or at a, ah, at an outside outdoor performance.  I -- I -- I think this is a very tough subject that they have assigned us because, um, they have experts in the government whose sole purpose is to, ah, is to work on this problem.
R:  [MN] Right and I don't -- I don't think it's necessarily a new problem.  I think it's just, um, been awakened since --
L:  Heightened.
R:  -- September eleventh.
L:  It's been heightened for sure.
R:  Right.
L:  Ah, because our subject is bioterrorism, not just terrorism.
R:  Right.
L:  So, bio meaning probably, ah, the dissemination of -- of germs --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of, ah, disease and so forth, um, I -- I don't know what to say, ah --
R:  [MN]
L:  [MN] ah, we have ten minutes that we have to try to think of something that our government might do.
R:  [MN]
L:  I think what they could do is to make the public more alert, to put out not so much these orange alerts that -- that then are called off because people do get immune and then they think crying wolf and then they -- they let their guard down but to, ah, just only sort of have sort of posters like we did during the war, "A slip of the lip can sink a ship".  That was the poster during the war.
R:  Oh, really?  Yeah.
L:  Ahah --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and, ah, it's a very good -- it's a very good motto, s- -- or slogan, "A slip of the lip can sink a ship" --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and th- [MN] these posters were all over the place along with war bonds and so forth but I -- I think, ah, [MN] keeping this kind of awareness always at the front without making it, um, the hysteria of orange alert, orange alert, all called off, all called off --
R:  Right.
L:  So, I think something like that because, um, [MN] all that we can do is to be alert.
R:  So, you think some sort of a campaign maybe.
L:  A campaign of a -- a -- a low, sort of a -- of a -- [MN] what do you call it, a low pressure campaign --
R:  [MN] Right.
L:  -- very serious, not having any funny stuff, not having any movie stars or b- but, um, just some very practical things to look for --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- that should just [MN] sort of be part of our everyday life.
R:  [MN] Well, I'm thinking back to the eighties with the big AIDS scare [MN] and I'm trying to think if they did anything to kind of help people --
L:  The AIDS scare?
R:  Well, when AIDS was just --
L:  In the eighties?
R:  A.I.D.S.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, when people were just finding out what it was and --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- how it was spread and things like that.
L:  And they were scared.
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  And they did foolish things.
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  [MN] Those poor gays. [LAUGH]
R:  But I- I'm thinking back when I was in high school.  That was, you know, when the AIDS thing was going on and then I look at my high school students now and they're so much more aware and they're not nearly as frightened.  They're --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- because they're much more educated.
L:  Ah, exactly.
R:  And they're making smarter choices.
L:  And they're putting AIDS in the proper place.  They're putting it where it should be, that it is a --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- it is a world epidemic, a world problem.
R:  Right.
L:  Terrible. 
R:  [MN]
L:  Yes.  It -- it is --
R:  B- because it, yeah, because when I remember, at first people thought it was just a homosexual disease --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- you know, and I think right now a lot of people don't realize that this bioterrorism is for everyone, could affect everyone.
L:  Everyone --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that's right.  [MN] Ah, I -- I think -- I think that's a very good comparison. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  What do you think we can do about, um, about alerting the public to bioterrorism or to make them more, I mean [MN] wh- what is it that the public can do except be more aware?
R:  Right.  Well, because it can come in so many different forms.  How do you adequately prepare yourself for it?
L:  I haven't done a thing.
R:  No, I haven't either. [MN]
L:  I --
R:  You know, I -- I don't know if you heard about putting, like, m- masking tape and plastic on your windows --
L:  Oh, of course, of course, I've -- I've -- all that stuff --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but, ah, I haven't, ah, people in -- in Israel, I believe, feel threatened, um, legitimately --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- and they have done that but, ah, and I know people did buy it here too.  Lots of people bought masking tape, of course.
R:  Mhm.
L:  There were jokes about it on the late night shows, about masking their doors and -- and windows in the event of an attack but, um, I don't know, maybe that's -- maybe -- maybe we should have, ah, as part of a first aid kit, rolls of masking tape.  Perhaps -- perhaps that's not too far fetched.  At least it's something that people can do.
R:  [MN] Yeah.  It's something people can do and maybe it would set people's mind at ease but I'm not sure how practical that would be.  I don't know.  I don't know if that would really prevent anything.  
L:  I think -- I think it's, ah, I think it's quite helpful.  I think what happens is that once you have masked your house so that no outside air penetrates, whatever the agent is outside settles.  At least it isn't in air, it settles on the ground, so that the, um, danger is diminished.  
R:  Okay. 
L:  I -- I just think that it's a -- a help.  It's --
R:  It would help -- it would be helpful if you were at home though.
L:  If you were at home.
R:  Right.
L:  If you were -- if you were wandering about on the street or playing tennis or some such thing.
R:  Or at work or at a grocery store, yeah.
L:  I don't think, yeah, you're -- you're stuck.
R:  Right.
L:  I don't know.  I -- I sort of go about my own life and, ah, I don't worry about it very much.  I -- I really hardly worry about it at all.
R:  Right.
L:  Do you?
R:  No, I really don't.  
L:  Where do you live?
R:  I live in Illinois, in kind of a small town.
L:  Oh, I live in Los Angeles which --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- which would be a target area.
R:  Right, much more exposed.
L:  Much more than a small town in -- in Illinois --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- although sometimes I wonder, now, what target would they pick out in Los Angeles? [LAUGH]
R:  Right. [MN]
L:  Would they pick out Disneyland, which isn't really Los Angeles?  
R:  Mhm.
L:  A ridiculous choice --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- or Century City?
R:  Right.
L:  I -- I really don't know.
R:  [MN] Well, I'm two hours from Chicago, which, you know, if it's bioterrorism it wouldn't take long to get here.
L:  [MN] And also they might miss.  They might miss Chicago.
R:  Right, exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] What town are you in?
R:  It's a little town called Rock Falls.
L:  Oh.  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  If you're not familiar with Illinois you wouldn't know anything about it. 
L:  Uh-uh.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No, not familiar.  [MN]
R:  No, huh-uh.
L:  Do people, ah, in your community, ah, seem to, ah, have any ideas about it?
R:  [MN] No, it's -- it's really not much of a topic of conversation in terms of what can we do about bioterrorism.
L:  No, it's not like during the, ah, Cold War, when people d- dug, um, [LIPSMACK] aircraft, um, bomb shelters.
R:  Oh, right, right.
L:  If you can remember back that far.
R:  I can remember reading about it. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, they had -- ahah.  But that was, ah, you know, that -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- that was people who felt the government could not protect them.
R:  Right.
L:  And they were right.  
R:  [MN] And I'm not sure when it comes to bioterrorism if the government can protect us now. 
L:  [MN]
R:  I think they're doing what they can --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but it would be so easy to slip something in.
L:  That's right.  
R:  I don't --
L:  They --
R:  -- I don't think we have screens at the airport for things, you know, or agents.  I mean people could --
L:  Well, they don't have to -- it wouldn't even have to be at the airport, would it?  It could --
R:  Well, no, I'm just saying to, you know --
L:  It could come in from, [MN] --
