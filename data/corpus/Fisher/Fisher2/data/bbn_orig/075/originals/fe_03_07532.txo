R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, I'm, ah, Sonia McKenzie.
R:  I am Christy Tarter[?].  Where are you calling from?
L:  I'm in Vancouver, Washington.
R:  Oh, I'm in --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- Indianapolis, Indiana.
L:  Oh, wow, that's in the middle, right?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, right in the middle, [LAUGH] the cross roads of America.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Wow, we've got a heavy topic today.
L:  Yeah, I know, it's, ah -- it's almost -- it's almost too, um, scary for me to even consider --
R:  Ah, you know what, I'm so glad --
L:  -- and talk about.
R:  -- to hear you say that 'cause I'm thinking how do I talk about something I don't like to talk about.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it's really intimidating.  That's the last time I talked to someone it was about, um, terrorism in general, but --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- bio terrorism is even scarier, I think.
R:  Yes, because it's pretty unseen and, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] you know, you just -- you just can't believe that it could happen, that anybody would be that devastatingly evil, you know.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Um, even Hitler didn't do that.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, he's -- he was kind of segregated in one area and --
R:  Yeah, th- -- true -- true --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, you know, I -- I --
L:  But --
R:  -- would think that technology probably was available then.  He could of just gassed all the -- the Jewish people --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I suppose.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, the thing that's scary is that we're so -- we're so vulnerable, I mean, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- my husband was telling me the other day that someone, um, a co- -- a -- a fr- -- a lady at the supermarket, her neighbor heard, I think one of her kids has, um --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- oh, I can't remember the name of it now; some kind of fever that, scarlet fever.
R:  Oh, no.
L:  And apparently someone, I don't know if they knew someone or came in contact with someone that was come -- traveled from out of the country and came back into the US and --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- that's how they con- contracted it, but --
R:  You know, it --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- seems like something has gotten --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- lax, because these kind of diseases; smallpox, ah, scarlet fever --
L:  Right.
R:  -- were supposed to be nonexistent.
L:  Exactly, they're coming back and that's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I think that's -- I think we're really vulnerable in that aspect because as Americans --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we don't think about that.
R:  So, it's kind of like sneaking into the country, it's not like somebody's flying over and dumping it on us --
L:  Right.
R:  -- which, I have to put some faith in -- actually, I probably do put a lot of faith in the American government, that they're on top of this, because, I mean --
L:  Well, you wouldn't sleep at night if you'd think that they weren't.
R:  Exactly.  [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- you know, we've got a open water, ah, well system in -- in Oregon and in Washington and my husband and I have, you know, walked --
R:  You do?
L:  -- traveled around, seen some of the -- the wells and stuff and, I mean, they're right open and they're so vulnerable to people throwing stuff in the water supply.  It's really kind of scary --
R:  You know, I, ah -- it --
L:  -- just thinking about that, ha.
R:  -- it is true because we are still trusting to certain aspects and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it kind of -- kind of reminds me of -- of, on a smaller level, in like nineteen eighty four when they had those Tylenol tamperings --
L:  Yeah, I remember that.
R:  -- yeah, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and now since then --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- everything you buy is covered --
L:  Everything -- right.
R:  -- packaged --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, it's almost ridiculous; you can't get into things.  [LAUGH]
L:  I know, it's hard to get into that stuff.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I know.
L:  I'm a new mom so I'm so thankful that those caps are on there, but it's like, I can't even get some stuff open now, it's just ridiculous.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you know what, seriously, I have broken nails, I've gotten --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- frustrated, I -- I mean glad we're being protected, but for heavens sake.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, you know, in -- in speaking of open the wells and things, when will they start covering and -- and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- doing that?
L:  I don't know.
R:  It's almost like something has to happen before they do.
L:  Yeah, that's what -- that's what I'm really afraid of, that someone's going to get hurt.
R:  Mm, gosh.
L:  Um, there's going to be -- there's going to be a lot -- it's going to be another tragedy before they -- they st- st- step up their measures to protect us --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- our water supply and --
R:  Gosh, I hope not, but you know --
L:  -- food.
R:  -- you could be right, but I think the water resources are probably the most easy to tamper with.
L:  Right.
R:  Don't you?  I mean, I think everything else has tightened up pretty well.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hm.
L:  Well, and it's -- it's j- just about anything, I mean produce could be in danger, I mean, you just never know, I know that they were, um, right after September eleventh they were concerned about crop dusters and --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, really?
L:  -- 'cause I think some of those --
R:  Oh, my god.
L:  -- some of those people that were, um, the hijackers had studied, or like, had been at some kind of f- flying school -- school --
R:  You know, you're right.
L:  -- where you learn how to, you know fly those planes.
R:  They took crop dusting courses, that's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- true.  That is so true.
L:  That -- I mean, that's terrifying.
R:  Oh, gosh, it is.
L:  Don't know what people are thinking.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you know, I've got a friend who, um, we're kind of confused, I graduated from him -- from high school and we're confused whether he works for the FBI or the CIA, he's --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- very secretive [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- I guess he has to be, and he lives in Washington DC and he actually, um, meets with the president four times a day with other groups of people.  He's --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- he's in the homeland security division --
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  -- and, you know, I trust this guy, he's very honest.  He said that we would be shocked and surprised at the measures and steps that have been taken that he cannot divulge.  So, that --
L:  Really?
R:  -- really put me at ease.  Now, I'm not saying that nothing could happen, but--
L:  Right.
R:  -- nothing has significantly happened since September eleventh.
L:  Right.
R:  Do you --
L:  So, I guess they are --
R:  -- are they waiting for our guard to be let down?
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  Do you think they're waiting for our guard to be let down?
L:  I don't -- I don't think so.  I think there probably is a lot going on behind the scenes that we don't know about --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and -- and as far as like terrorists and all that, I don't -- I don't think they really care if we're on alert or not, I just, um --
R:  Right.  You know what?  I think you got it.  [LAUGH] I think that's so true.  [LAUGH]
L:  I just think that when these people are just so radical and suicidal and they don't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and they're doing it for their faith or their people and I think when you're zealots like that you just don't, you don't care what the other person's thinking or just suffering or --
R:  I think that is one of the -- the biggest fear is within this is their disregard for their own life, they're not gonna care about anybody elses.
L:  They're not gonna care, yeah.  It's really sad.  I just, ah --
R:  That's a good point.  Gosh --
L:  But --
R:  -- well, how has, um, you know, I know that -- that the Anthrax was such a big scare and that's just kind of -- kind of subsided and --
L:  Yeah, they -- I know that they're -- they're, um -- there's some kind of investigation going on a- as far as that, and there was something on, I think, ah, MSNBC last week about they're following up on something.
R:  Oh, really?  Where was that?
L:  Yeah.  Oh, I can't remember where, but there was some kind of facility or -- or somewhere where they found traces of it --
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  -- initially and they were like just collecting evidence and stuff and, gosh, it's been two years since that happened --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and they're still just in a kind of investigative --
R:  Oh, is, now --
L:  -- process.
R:  -- that's typical.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I'm just so surprised with our media that we haven't heard more about it.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, you know that -- I -- I think that's a good point, everything seems to be kind of quiet --
L:  Right.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and, um, you want to know but.  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't wa- -- there's just some things I just don't want to know -- I just want to be updated every day about something, you know --
R:  Oh, oh, I hear --
L:  -- 'cause.
R:  -- you.  'Cause we have to go on with everyday living.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, I think we're all more aware and, mm, I -- I --
L:  I'm certainly more aware.
R:  -- don't know, maybe -- maybe I should think more about it, the -- of the possibility of it happening, but I -- I hate to say that if it happens it happens, like what can we really do?  Is that terrible?  [LAUGH]
L:  No.  I just think it's important for people to have some kind of basis of faith to --
R:  Right.
L:  -- deal with that kind of fear, because if you sit in your house and you watch TV all day and get, you know -- you get caught up within all the fear, I mean, got to have an out.
R:  Oh, you know what, you are right on the --
L:  [inaudible].  [LAUGH]
R:  -- money, because my sister was unemployed for -- for quite a while and she is a TV junkie, so --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- there she was, right at the start of the war --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- watching and --
L:  Watching all that.
R:  -- watching this stuff, and I got the most bizarre emails from her saying, when we get attacked, let's decide that we meet here and -- and I'll drive from my place, and I called her and I said, "Lara, it's okay".  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just -- just relax, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- i- it can be too much information, I agree.  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  Yeah.  You just kind of worry about everything, but you just got to take your precautions, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [inaudible] --
R:  Yeah, like, for instance, I -- I kind of told my sons the same thing you said, "that you just have to have faith that --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, if it happens it happens, it'll be our time, not to worry about it", 'cause I --"
L:  Right.
R:  -- ah, you said you have children?
L:  Yes, I have a four month old and a twenty three month old.
R:  Oh, okay, so when September eleventh happened they -- they had no clue th- that --
L:  No, he was --
R:  [LAUGH] He was so --
L:  -- eight weeks old [LAUGH] huh.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH] he had no clue.
L:  Just a little biddy.
R:  My kids are now ten and twelve, so, two years ago, you know, they were ten and eight and --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- um, having to put all that in perspective for them --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then the Anthrax scare, and not to mention that we were going to fly three weeks after September eleventh --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I said, "Guys, we're going.  We are not gonna, you know", we -- we listened to President Bush, ah, one evening and he was saying, you know, keep going on with your lives --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and we did --
L:  You did.
R:  -- I think you're right in facing it that way.
L:  Mhm.  You've got to.  You don't -- you just don't want your kids to have all that -- they sense the fear from your par- -- from parents anyway.
R:  Oh, boy is that the truth --
L:  So, yeah.
R:  -- I mean even -- even your little one, you know --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- right after September eleventh happened, and it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- rattled everybody --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah, even the -- the six week old probably sensed something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You think?
L:  I think so.  I think they sense that, that [inaudible] that fear.
R:  Yeah, cause it was just such a kick in the stomach.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I, ah -- did you see all that unfold on TV?
L:  Yeah, my best friend, um, woke us up.  She was -- she's in Texas and she called us and it was -- I guess it was eight in the morning whenever --
R:  Oh, that's right, you would have been in a totally different time zone.
L:  Yeah, she was, like, turn on your TV, [inaudible] and we just could not believe it.  Then my sister, um, is in college in New York and she called my mom --
R:  Oh, my god, she was in New York.
L:  -- who's in Texas and she was crying, she was hysterical --
R:  Oh, god yes.
L:  -- she wanted to come home.  She was really scared.
R:  Oh, that's so sad.
L:  That was, yeah, that was really -- really --
R:  That is so sad.  What would we do without our friends that would call us and say turn on the TV to see the worst thing you've ever seen in your --
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [LAUGH] life.  I -- my neighbor did that to me and I'm still mad at her I said I never watch --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, I d- don't watch --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- TV that time of day --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and you know we sat there and watched people get murdered --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it affected me very deeply, really.
L:  I really can't watch the footage any more, I'm -- I watched it, ah --
R:  Me neither.
L:  -- probably about two weeks afterwards I just stopped watching it --
