L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Hello.  Hello?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, this is Nicole.
L: And I'm David.
R:  Oh, how are you, David? [LAUGH]
L:  I'm fine [LAUGH]. How are you?
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.  Do you, um -- well, as far as the question is concerned about what we can do -- the US can do about the bioterrorism, uh, now mostly all what they've already done as far as keeping everyone warned.
L:  [MN] That's true, I mean, there's just too many new things coming out every day.
R:  Right.  And, it's for me --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Just from my spiritual standpoint, the -- the Bible talks about that these things must occur so it's kinda like [LAUGH] them trying to fight against something that's already --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know, supposed to happen.
L:  That's it.  I mean, they could issue gas masks, all that kind of stuff, but it's just -- what's going to happen's going to happen.
R:  Right, right.
L:  I mean -- [COUGH]
R:  I -- [LAUGH]
L:  -- there's enough chemical agents flitting round even that are not meant for weapons.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, the stuff we breathe every day.
R:  You know, uh, well as far as what they're doing -- I don't know if it really -- what can they do?  Chemicals are --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [MN] Not -- not that they're difficult to contain but once they get out there what -- what can you do?  There's no way for you to [LAUGH] -- to --
L:  Exactly, once it mixes in the air, there's nothing you can do to stop it.
R:  That's it, so I don't -- I don't know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- other than, uh -- [LAUGH] other than everyone needs to pray. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, it's like in the fifties when everybody built bomb shelters.
R:  [LAUGH] [MN] Now I did hear -- I'm not really familiar with that so you can -- you can explain that to me some.
L:  Well, back in the fifties when the [inaudible] phrase atomic bomb --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- everybody went in their backyards, dug down thirty, forty, fifty feet and put concrete bunkers in their yards --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [NOISE] so they could keep their family safe.  I mean, it's paranoia.  If you're going to worry about something all the time, something's going to get you, no matter what it is.
R:  Yes, your -- your worst fear will come upon you, yes.
L:  Exactly.  I mean, right after nine eleven I admit, I got -- I'd go up to the mailbox and open it and wonder if there was some kind of white powder or something in it.
R:  Yeah, right. [LAUGH] Yeah, you -- you know when I caught myself --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- being afraid to open the mail, I thought, "Okay, I can't do this.  I have to go on and live here.  I can't pray and worry, that doesn't go together" --
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  You know.  You know, if you're going to pray, pray and believe and just go on with life.
L:  I mean, where I live it's one of the -- used to -- well, where I used to live, was the prime target for stuff like that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and right now I live within five miles of an ammunition plant.
R:  See that's what I'm saying.  Face it head on. [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, we -- we got just as much risk of our own plant blowing up and killing --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- us all --
R:  Right.
L:  -- as somebody else doing it to us.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.
R:  So, when, um -- when the towers are -- were, um, attacked were you afraid?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, there's an old saying, "If a man's never afraid, he's a fool".
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, you know, I laid awake and I wondered if my kids were going to survive the next day, you know.
R:  Oh.  Well, you -- did you live in New York?
L:  No, I live way down here -- I'm western Tennessee and Virginia but --
R:  [SIGH] Oh, okay, okay.
L:  So, I mean, it's the same thing, it's -- you gotta wonder wh- -- if New York's the target -- of course, New York's a big city --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but I'm close enough to DC that if they ever decide to wipe out DC with a nuclear weapon, it's going to take out half the state of Virginia, too, so ...
R:  Oh, okay, okay.  Well, I kinda had like a mixed reaction.  I -- I was -- I was -- I got caught up in everybody else's fear and in the --
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah, I said, "Oh man, I can't live like this".  I was pregnant at the time and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it -- it wasn't fun so I -- you know, and I really just learned to limit the amount of news that I watched because --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- there's no need to see your fears. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, you watched it -- the first hour I think everybody was glued to their set, they can't get away from it.
R:  Exactly.  I was watching CNN and [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, local news.
R:  -- local news, the late news --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ABC news, the World Tonight. [LAUGH]
L:  I even -- I even was sitting in front of my TV and had my computer on another news thing.
R:  Yeah, [MN] you -- you -- why am I feeling this?  There's -- there's no need for me to do this.
L:  Yeah.  And I -- you got to tell yourself, "Okay, back off, get your life back together" --
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  -- and --
R:  I, you know, I -- I got caught up in it and I thought, "Oh goodness, I can't do this, I can't do it".  My appetite was being affected, my hair, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I was looking at everything.
L:  Yeah, scared to death to turn around.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] And it's just -- I had only moved in with my girlfriend a few weeks earlier and -- but I had already saw the kids as my kids and I wanted to go down and get 'em out of school and bring 'em up home and hide 'em but, you know, what good's that going to do?
R:  Right.  Then you going to teach them the fear so you -- you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It -- it's something when you have children, they're watching you react to things and you want to make sure you don't teach them to be afraid of everything.
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know, it -- it -- it -- how old are they?
L:  Uh, the girl -- my daughter's fourteen and my son just turned twelve the other day.
R:  Oh, wow. [LAUGH]
L:  And, I mean, I'm going through this thing of -- of being a stepdad --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and it's like [NOISE] they're your kids, you gotta protect them [NOISE] but you can't lock 'em in their rooms and think they're going to be safe.
R:  Right, right.
L:  [NOISE] But, you know, it -- the world is just to the point where, you know, the Bible's fulfilling itself and we just have to wait and see where it goes.
R:  Yes, you know, and I really, I just look on now and I say, "You know, I know I read about this in the Bible" --
L:  Right.
R:  and I -- I don't know, all I can do is pray for the President Bush and the advisers and --
L:  Right.
R:  And trust that they make the right decisions.
L:  I unfortunately grew up in a family who was not very religious --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- and I didn't really find God until about two years ago and it's like I'm reading the Bible for the first time --
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  -- and it's -- it's scary to think -- you know, I don't if scared's the right word but when you read in the Bible and you realize what has already happened and, you know, what the Bible says is going to happen --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- has happened, it's like, "Okay, it's coming close".
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I just hope and pray that when it does come time that, you know, we're together.
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, you know, I don't know if we're exactly on topic with this but [LAUGH] that's the way I feel.
R:  But no that's the way I was -- I'm like, well if this topic is about bioterrorism I'm not going to talk about fear, I have to talk about faith. [LAUGH]
L:  There you go, there you go.  This is the first one of these calls I've gotten so --
R:  Oh, it is?  This is my last one. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So I don't even know what the deal is.  My wife told me about it and I signed up for it and I got in -- I wasn't even expecting a call until late this afternoon.
R:  Oh well, no, I said, "Let me just, you know, go ahead and do my part".  I have to fulfil it, I'm trying to, you know, do -- [LAUGH] be a woman of integrity here. [LAUGH]
L:  There you go.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I mean, you know, [NOISE] -- my cat just cried, it scared me [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know I live way in the country --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and you don't think that stuff like that's going to happen in this area.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean I live in the mountains and you -- you know, the biggest thing round here, you hear gunshots all the time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but you know what it is, it's people either shooting -- target shooting in their backyards or somebody out hunting.  It's not like in the city when you hear a gunshot, you just automatically afraid somebody's going to die.
R:  Right.  Well, that's got to be -- you know, that's different for you because you don't necessarily think someone's being killed, you just know [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- someone's been training.
L:  Well, I was -- when I lived in Roanoke, which is a small city compared with New York but it's much bigger than where I live now --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, my worst enemy, the guy that I thought was always too hostile and everything, got killed in a drive by --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and I was thinking to myself when it happened, I mean, me and this guy didn't get along but he didn't -- did not deserve that --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and he was an accidental victim of a drive by shooting of a gang and you just don't think about stuff like that happening. [NOISE]
R:  Mm.
L:  So, I mean, like -- like we said before, if it's going -- if you're going to die, it's going to happen, no matter what we do.
R:  Yeah, it is. [LAUGH] Bioterrorism, I -- I --
L:  [NOISE] [MN]
R:  I really don't have -- you know, people talk about it, well, my -- my answer to bioterrorism is really different from anybody else's, I'm like, "Well, this is supposed to happen".
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  You know.
L:  I mean, you can't -- you can't wrap yourself in plastic and seal off --
R:  Buy the duct tape and -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  What was it they said, get duct tape and water?
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] yeah.
L:  Yeah, that would be real good --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- just seal your house up so that you can't get air, you know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, forget about the bioterrorism, you die of lack of oxygen.
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  You know.  I realize they mean well when they came up with the ideas but some of them are so silly.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, if you really stop and think about them, now that's really foolish. [LAUGH]
L:  How do you base --
R:  How am I supposed to breathe? [LAUGH]
L:  Just completely seal off your home --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, and forget about the fact that there ain't no bathroom in the room you just sealed off.
R:  And forget about the fact that when you go to clean your house you're going to inhale all those chemicals and kill yourself. [LAUGH]
L:  That's ridiculous, it really is.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  There's even stickers on the floor of the grocery store up here that says, "The United States Government suggests you get in a good supply of this item" --
R:  [inaudible] book. [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, "Bottle of water, uh, duct tape, uh, sheet plastic", [NOISE] you know, might as well just go ahead and crawl into the coffin and close the door and just be done with it.
R:  Yeah, well, you know, well if something's going to, you know, happen it's just going to happen --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's it.  No amount of duct tape in the world can stop God. [LAUGH]
L:  That's it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, and, you know, right after nine eleven we went to church and the first words out of the preacher's mouth was, "I know you're wondering why God let this happen" and I was thinking, "That's not what I'm thinking".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, even the preachers got a little --
R:  Carried away.
L:  -- off the deep --
