R:  Hi.  M- -- I'm Elizabeth and I'm living in Seattle.
L:  Hi.  I'm Dave.  I'm in, ah, Boston.
R:  Boston?  How interesting.
L:  Yep.  We're --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- on opposite sides of the country.
R:  Completely.  I -- I got a call the other day from a lady in Seattle.  I thought that was, kind of, ironic but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I guess this is all over the country.
L:  All over.  Yep.
R:  Yeah.  Well, they said, "How can we stop bioterrorism?"
L:  Ah, yes.
R:  Uh.
L:  That's what they said.  What --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- can the US government do to --
R:  Ah --
L:  -- prevent bioterrorism?
R:  I don't think they can.
L:  Ah, did they say -- yeah, they said, "bioterrorism" didn't they?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh.
R:  And that's, like, g- germs and, you know, gases and stuff.
L:  Right.
R:  Like --
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] well, they can [LIPSMACK] -- I don't know.  Help defuse the anger in the world --
R:  Th- that's --
L:  I guess.
R:  -- the -- probably[?], believe me -- the only way that they could do it is --
L:  Ah --
R:  -- yeah, make a pact or -- not that they'd ever a- agree to a pact or stick to it once they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- agreed to it even.  I mean, they make peace plans all the time and don't follow through with them so ...
L:  [SIGH]
R:  It's very frightening to me to think that they can do that.  I'm -- d- -- I, ah, was very complacent until nine one one and, you know, my whole thing has, sort of, [LAUGH] been shattered.  I don't have a whole lot of faith in any government any more.
L:  Ah, yeah.
R:  And --
L:  Well, they've done a lot since then, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- with set, you know, c- cameras and, you know, more surveillance, more security, more checks, you know?  It's a l- -- lost some of our freedoms for all the --
R:  Quite a few of them I think.
L:  -- for all the, ah, you know, security measures they've taken since then and I think it does, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] ah, reduce the chances of something happening but it also takes away some freedoms.
R:  Well, and I --
L:  So --
R:  I think the parent -- people that we're dealing with aren't rational.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, no matter what we say to them they're gonna say whatever they think we wanna hear and do whatever they wanna do anyway.  Their -- their, t- -- um, religious is [inaudible] and so they have -- that's their mission.  They don't really care about any worldly goods or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, peace on earth.  They don't -- their -- their pr- -- peace is gonna be when they're some place else and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's --
L:  That's kinda scary.
R:  It is scary.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Y- you can walk down the streets and not know, you know, what -- I mean, they're having that all the time now.  They're having women suicide bombers.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Ah [SIGH] --
L:  That's something fairly new.
R:  Yeah.  I'm like, "Oh, my god".
L:  So --
R:  And they'll have children pretty soon.  I'm sure they have children now and we just haven't heard about it.
L:  Children suicide bombers?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, that's -- that's -- well, he- --
R:  Ah, yeah.  It's real hard to --
L:  Ah --
R:  -- even fathom.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I think they -- that was something they did in, ah, Vietnam too.  Didn't --
R:  Yeah, they did.  Yeah.
L:  They --
R:  Sent the kids out.
L:  -- strapped bombs to the kids.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  Well, [SIGH] um --
R:  I think -- 
L:  [LIPSMACK] So, we- we're pretty, ah -- we're pretty -- what is it -- bearish on, ah, the ability of the government to do anything --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to protect us.
R:  Yeah.  And you know, it -- on -- being, o- on the West Coast and you being on the East Coast, we are both more susceptible than -- than middle of the country to any kind of thing 'cause it will probably come to us -- to our area.
L:  Closer to the, ah, foreign countries --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that --
R:  'Cause we're --
L:  -- might come through.
R:  -- just, ah, down the street from Japan and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and all of that kind of thing.  And -- and you guys, ah -- well, let's see?  I don't know.  Are you close -- you're close to --
L:  Close to --
R:  -- some of a --
L:  -- Europe --
R:  -- Europe.
L:  -- England --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and France and, ah --
R:  We haven't made very good friends with France either. [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, no.  No.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Ah --
R:  It's, ah, kind of a frightening situation.
L:  I like the French but I guess --
R:  I -- I do too.  I think --
L:  -- a lot of people don't.
R:  I think that's, kind of, silly. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But a- anyway, that's the way a lot of people think I guess.
L:  Yeah.  But I think they're trying to mend the relationship.  I -- I am not too concerned about that.  I think that, um -- that relationship will -- we have -- we need each other so --
R:  Yeah.  I'm hoping that you're right on that.
L:  Ah --
R:  It's -- it's real difficult.  I -- again, about stopping it, I think you're right on -- the only way we can is if we are their allies more so than we are now.  W- we could be but they don't wanna listen to anything we have to say and so they're gonna do what they wanna do but if we can convince them that we're on their side --
L:  Right.
R:  And I wouldn't even be convinced. [LAUGH] I mean, you know? [COUGH] The government hasn't done a lot to convince me of too many things.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  There's got to be a way to diffuse the anger some how.  You know, s- --
R:  Yep.
L:  Reduce the number of people who are angry at us.  Ah, I think that's, ah --
R:  It seems this whole generation is angry.  I have a son who's the same way.  It -- I don't know where the anger comes from either and -- my daughter who's full of happiness and lightness and a son who's just full of anger.  And -- and I see, ah --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so many kids nowadays just full of anger and they don't really have any way to release it or know what it's about even.
L:  Oh.
R:  They're just angry.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That -- yeah.  The whole Columbine thing showed --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- us how angry kids [LAUGH] c- can be.
R:  Yup.  Yeah.  That -- when that happened I just, ah, you know -- it was a brand new thing then and, ah, it's just -- seems to be getting more frequent.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Instead of less happening.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I don't know.
L:  Well --
R:  There's gotta be some answers but ... [LIPSMACK] You know, I -- I -- I haven't been to an airport since it happened so I don't even know what the conditions are at the airport.
L:  Since nine one one?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh.
R:  I haven't -- haven't gone anywhere.  I just -- well, I'm in Seattle and, ah, it's real hard [LAUGH] to get to the airport here anyway and so I just haven't really wanted to go anywhere.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, but I'm sure that they have things -- I don't know.  I've been in the Federal Building and I've had -- come out and realized I had fingernail files in my wallet, ah, or in my purse and I've thought, "Oh, you know, away[?] -- I should've gotten caught for that".  But I guess it's maybe not as much in the buildings as it is in the airports.
L:  Um, yeah.  I've b- -- I've gone through with a -- like a little Swiss Army knife.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, I think --
R:  And not even think- -- yeah.  Not thinking about it.
L:  And not thinking about it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But it wasn't caught.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  And that's kinda scary.
L:  But -- but I think they do catch a lot.  I -- some --
R:  Yeah.
L:  M- -- ah.  I don't know.  It was a -- it was this little, tiny, like, one inch blade.  It was just used for, like, cutting open boxes and stuff but --
R:  Yeah.  But it's just, ah, yeah.  It's -- it -- they -- they try very hard but it -- the human error is there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Humans are doing it so there's gotta be errors.
L:  Right.
R:  And, um, I just wish that we [SIGH] could come up with some answers to -- like that anthrax vaccine.  I think that was horrible to have to have -- anybody to have to go through that.
L:  What was that?
R:  That -- when they got vaccinated for that anthrax.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And that -- a- all the service people who were going to, um, Iraq had to get s- -- ah, some kind of vaccinations against the different toxins and stuff that they can use against us and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it -- you know, it's -- i- i- it didn't even happen.  I mean, there was --
L:  Right.
R:  -- none of that there when they got there so they got n- n- -- all that vaccinations for nothing.  Ha- --
L:  I wonder what the, ah -- you know, if there are any long term --
R:  The, um, effects?
L:  -- effects of -- of that sort of thing.
R:  That's the scary part.
L:  You know?
R:  You don't know.  They don't know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They don't even know the short terms yet.
L:  Right.
R:  They just wanna get everybody -- get it into people and see what happens and -- I mean, that's just defeating our ho- -- the whole purpose.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And --
L:  That's scary stuff that anthrax.  Um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And all those -- well, all those -- that anthrax scare we had right after September eleventh --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- those were -- those were all, like, local people doing that.  It w- --
R:  Yeah.
L:  It -- you know, that was just some nutty Americans --
R:  [LAUGH] You see -- see that's the other scary part.
L:  -- trying to scare people.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  We have so many of those too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That they don't know who -- what group they belong to.  And --
L:  Right.
R:  It's, ah -- you walk down the street and you don't know what's going through anybody's mind and they could shoot you for no reason.  Just, ah ...  But I -- I've refused to let it get me down.  I'm not gonna, um, crawl in a corner and -- and not live.  I --
L:  Right.
R:  I've --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've decided that's not gonna work for me so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I still --
R:  And I --
L:  -- travel on --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- business and stuff so that hasn't -- well actually, right after September eleventh, I took the train --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- on one trip. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Instead of, ah, flying but ...
R:  But I think those people are smart enough not to do the same thing twice.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, that was the --
L:  Right.
R:  -- other thing.  I thought, "Th- th- th- the hor- -- the horse has already gone, why lock the barn now" you know?"
L:  Right.
R:  With the -- all these things that they've done they probably won't repeat 'til there's something entirely different --
L:  Well --
R:  -- that we weren't even prepared for then.
L:  Right.
R:  So --
L:  Something clever that we're not ready for.
R:  Yeah.  And we'll all go, --
L:  N- no.
R:  -- "Wow, how did they figure [LAUGH] that one out?"  And it's right in front of us the entire time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.  It's just, ah, one day to another.  It's just -- you have to wake up with a smile.
L:  Yeah.  Yup.  Just, ah, got our lives to lead and, ah ... [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] [PAUSE] 
R:  I don't think we have any answers.  I don't think the government has answers either.  I think we're just gonna have to -- we're gon- -- keep our eye out the best that we can and -- but they want us to report on our neighbors and, you know, I'm not into that one either.  It's --
L:  Yeah.  I haven't.  Yeah.
R:  It's, kinda -- well, we're inves- --
L:  Unless there's something really suspicious but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- none of my neighbors [LAUGH] -- I -- I just moved to a new place so I don't really know my neighbors but --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- I mean, I'm not gonna snoop around.
R:  No.  No.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I've lived mine for eleven years and I -- they come and go.  You know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I live in a department house so they -- it changes constantly.  But there's a few here that've been here for a while and, um -- but I don't them.  I mean, I know -- I speak to them and -- and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- we'll say, "Hi" but I don't know, um, where [LAUGH] they're from or what they're up to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or anything.
L:  Yeah.  That's funny how that's changed.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  I know when I was growing up that our neighborhood everybody knew that --
R:  Everybody knew everybody and watched --
L:  -- each -- everybody and --
