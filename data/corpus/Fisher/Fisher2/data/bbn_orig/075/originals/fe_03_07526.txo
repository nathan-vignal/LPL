R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  I'm Anne.
L:  Hi.  I'm Chastity[?].
R:  Um.
L:  Hi.  Ah --
R:  So, what do you think about bioterrorism?
L:  Oh, it's -- it's a really, um, sensitive subject from my house.  Ah, my husband is a marine.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So, it really hits home.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, right now he is in Okinawa, so, um --
R:  Where's that?
L:  Japan.
R:  Is that a base or ...?
L:  Japan, yeah.
R:  Oh.  
L:  And, ah, so this subject, you know, is, like I said, is really, um, I don't know.  There -- there's so many different ways that they could attack --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and just so many different methods that I don't know if we would even be prepared for it.
R:  Yeah.  Do you feel like you have, um, like, more information about, um, like, ways to prevent bioterrorism or, like, the threat of bioterrorism because your husband's a marine?
L:  No, not so much that because, um, I don't really know, you know, um, he use- -- I don't really know that -- that -- that part but, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't know, there's just -- I just don't think that -- I don't know, there's just so many different -- there's so many different ways that they can do it.  Um, the only thing that I would think that we could protect ourselves more is, um, this -- the homeland security and they're doing a great job --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And dealing --
R:  You mean, like, from airports and protect the borders and stuff?
L:  Yeah, airports, um, coastguard is doing a wonderful job, you know, protecting the coasts and the waterways and just really beefing up the military would be one way --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I would think that we could really [LIPSMACK] sup- -- you know, protect ourselves but [LIPSMACK] other than that --
R:  The thing about bioterrorism though is that, like, if there was sort of, like, a bioterrorist, like, attack it wouldn't necessarily be so recognizable, you know.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Like, they, I mean, it might not come in a boat or it might not come in the form of, like, a military action.
L:  Right.  It would be more like, um, dropping, I would think it would be, like, more like dropping something in a water supply --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or, you know, that I guess would be more testing.  We'd have to just do, you know, tests for water and tests, make sure -- I -- but I -- you know, bioterrorism, that's -- that is a very scary subject.
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and very -- it's --
R:  Do you think that, like, since there are so many different ways that, like, if there was a bioterrorist attack it could come about that it makes it, like, so much harder to protect against?
L:  Yeah, it w- -- it really is.  I think it would.  Um, I guess that there's just different things that they could do.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um ...
R:  I think, like -- like, that nature of bioterrorism that, like, you can't -- that you couldn't really protect exactly where it would be coming from or where it would be, like, targeted.
L:  Right, and you couldn't e- -- like -- 
R:  Is that, like --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- there's only so much you can do --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so, like, in -- in terms of, like, fortifying, like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- borders and stuff --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like that.  Like, it seems like you would have to do it, there would have to be another way, like, another sort of, like, preventative measure.
L:  I don't even --
R:  You know, like, maybe diplomacy or something like that.
L:  Yeah, um, I don't even think that would, I don't [MN] -- the minds of these people that are doi- -- would do this --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is just so -- is so far, you know, that I don't even think they could even can be reached diplomatically.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I think their -- their minds are criminal.  I mean, that -- to even think of anything in -- to hurt people like that is just beyond, you know, comprehend -- you know, [MN] it's just -- I don't think there's anything -- they can even be reached diplomatically.
R:  Who do you think -- who do you think are the groups that would, like, do a bioterrorist stunt?
L:  Oh, there would definitely be -- I would think it would be the -- I think the Middle Eastern groups --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the Al Qaeda and those places that, [MN] yeah, um, Saddam Hussein's people and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah --
R:  Like, as a reaction against the war?
L:  Right.  Yeah.  It would -- it would be like a reaction, I would think.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know.
R:  So, if you don't think diplomacy would work, what do you think, like, the most effective tactic would be?
L:  I'm not really sure.  I don't even think there would be a, you know, I don't even know if there would even be a safe way to protect us since [MN], you know, um, I don't really know.
R:  Yeah, I think that's like one of the biggest problems about, like, trying to evaluate, like -- like modes of protection is, like, they're so, like, how can you know about bioterrorism, like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's never really happened before and you know --
L:  Right
R:  -- [MN] and, like, it seems like a lot of it, a lot of, like, a lot of the concern about it is based on, um, I don't know, like, just, like, it's not based on -- it's not based on what's happened before, you know. 
L:  Mhm.  Well, th- there is nothing really been happened before --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and this is such a new threat that it's not like, um, a- a, you know, attack on anything else.  It's --
R:  Mm.
L:  This is such a new thing and the technology is, you know, so far advanced that, you know, it could, ah, it's just, I don't know, it's just really ...
R:  I would really like to think that there would be a way to -- to prevent, like, attacks like that being made just to, like, take away a motive for it, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  Like, you do, like, d- diplomacy or, like, I don't know just trying to [MN], like, developing closer relations with -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like, the world community.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] Instead of being, like, so oppositional 'cause I feel like if our government appears to be really oppositional to, like, other nations --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then other nations will be more, like, [inaudible] use violent tactics against us.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, like, to sort of, like, as a preventative measure against US action.
L:  Right.  Well, I don't know, I don't even know if, like, the -- the government wouldn't -- I don't even know if they're trying to even come up with anything like that.  I'm not really sure --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know.  It's just -- it's such a, you know, it's a process.  It's such a long process.  Ah, I don't even know if we have time --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  So you feel, like, the threat is sort of imminent?
L:  I'm not really sure.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't ... [NOISE]
R:  Do you think the government is doing anything to prevent it?
L:  [MN]
R:  You know, like, specifically bioterrorism, like, as opposed to just, like, in general, like, security?
L:  I don't know.  I think they're more fo- focused on the security, the homeland security.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [MN]
R:  So, like, I hear a lot of buzz about, like, bioterrorism or whatever --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in the news but, like, I don't really hear about anything in spec- -- like, specifically --
L:  Specific.
R:  Like, specific preventative measures.
L:  No and I don't even know if the general public would even hear of any specific because, I mean, they would have to keep it -- I would think they'd have to keep it, not really so much a secret, but if it got out to the people who are trying to, you know, harm us this way then they would know how we're trying to protect ourselves.
R:  [MN] Mhm.
L:  And that would be -- it would be more like, um, you know, [several inaudible words] up for them.
R:  [MN]. So, you think it's, like important that, like, um, preventative measures are kept secret?
L:  [MN] Yeah, that way, you know, like I said, that -- then they wouldn't, um -- they -- they couldn't know ahead of time [NOISE] how we're -- how we're dealing with it and how --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we're, ah, you know, protecting ourselves 'cause then they'd be, like, "Oh, okay, well, we can see their weaknesses" --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and they would see, you know, what we're lacking in and then attack that way or they would focus on that. [MN]
R:  Do you think bio- -- is bioterrorism something that, like, you, like, personally are, like, concerned about, like, or fear?
L:  Um, pers- --
R:  Or do you feel like the government is, like, under control of things and, like, they must be doing something that we don't know about but they're doing something?
L:  Yeah, I think they've, they are smart enough and they're, you know, protecting us as much as they can and, um, I don't feel the -- the threat personally, ah, not right now, not at this time --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but it -- I mean, that could all change in a matter of, you know ... [MN] but right now I think that the government's doing a pretty good job in keeping us and, like I said, the [inaudible] that, you know, the homeland security is doing a wonderful job.  That -- that whole, um -- and they did such a good job over -- over in Iraq that they -- they did a good job --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that I think it's, [NOISE] you know, they're not going to affect us in that way.
R:  What do you -- what do you think about, like, the whole smallpox vaccine, like, phenomenon?
L:  [MN] You know, I don't know, and the funny thing is, is um [LIPSMACK] my husband received it and -- when he was a child and he's not even old enough to [MN] -- to be in that age group but his mother insisted that he have it and, um, to get it again I don't even know what they're saying now but the ones that they had [NOISE] back in the sixties --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- aren't really effective any more.
R:  The -- the smallpox vaccine --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that they used in the sixties?
L:  That they're --
R:  Have they developed, like, a new vaccine? 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I didn't know about that.
L:  I don't know.  I don't know, but all the people th- -- who were vacc- -- you know, vaccinated in the sixties --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- were saying that theirs is not really any good any more.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I don't know.
R:  I know there are some hospitals, um, near where I live, that they, like, refused to get their personnel vaccinated 'cause they were scared about the side effects of it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and that especially, like, for people who have, like, compromised immune systems they, like, were worried that they would actually get smallpox and that would create, like, an epidemic.
L:  Mhm.  That's entirely possible, I think.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, and that and [MN] the people who [MN], like the elder- --
