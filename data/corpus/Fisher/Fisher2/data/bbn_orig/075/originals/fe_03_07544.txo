L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Now, it picked up.  I'm Wendy.
L:  I'm Wanda.
R:  Oh, nice to meet you.
L:  Nice to meet you.
R:  Well, um, it's funny because I was actually talking to my roommate about this today.  Um, we -- he was talking about how, you know, in Colombia the US has been, um, supporting the government over there to spray all this Agent Orange all over the crops out there to, you know, stop the cocaine war but at the same time, you know, all these Colombians are having babies with birth defects right now.
L:  Why would they spray Agent Orange if they know what it does?
R:  Well --
L:  Given the Vietnam War?
R:  Right, right, it's not ... well, the US isn't actually spraying it.  The US is funding the government to spray it but in these third world countries they just kind of don't care.  You know what I mean?  They're just very -- um, they're run by, you know, a few top people and they're not really run by the -- the common people like we are as much, you know?
L:  But does it really make a difference if the US is funding it or the US is doing it themselves?  They wouldn't be doing it if -- if the US wasn't funding it.  They wouldn't -- Colombia probably wouldn't be spraying the crops --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I'm sure if the US is going to fund it I'm sure there's other herbicides or -- or something else that they could use that would be just as effective and not as much of a [MN] risk to human life.
R:  Right.  Well ...
L:  I mean, that's the way I look at it, you know.  It doesn't make --
R:  Right.  Oh, I agree, like, I totally think it's wrong and they should -- they should, you know, put some more money in and invest in something else but, I guess they've just decided that's the cheapest thing and, so, it's -- it's really messed up.  Um ...
L:  It's crazy.  Now, as far as bioterrorism --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- [SIGH] [MN] they need -- they need to open their pockets a little wider, I think.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  They need to -- you know, I'm not so worried about -- about a tax cut as much as I am [LIPSMACK] about what kind of an earth I'm leaving for my children.  
R:  Right.
L:  You know --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and bioterrorism is something that we're not going to know until it's too late.
R:  Right.
L:  And we need to start at the beginning and -- and, um, [MN] I don't know, secure our borders a little bit more, ah, be a little bit more cautious and I -- I don't think they've been as cautious as they could be.  
R:  Yeah, that's definitely one way.  Um, as -- what I was thinking when all this nine eleven stuff even started is, I was just wishing that we had gotten more involved in -- in helping those countries in -- in, you know, lifting the people up, like, especially the common people because, you know, we le- left these big gaps in the power system for these, like, crazy people to come into power --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and it's -- [MN] I think that's a big source of a lot of it too.
L:  Right, and then to think that we trained some of these people --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- blows my mind.  It just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- blows my mind.
R:  Yeah.
L:  How could've we have been so -- so naive?  We train 'em so they'll be [inaudible] and don't pay attention --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, don't -- don't keep our eye on -- on what we're doing.
R:  It seems like you really have to be, um, so, you know, so studious on politics and on who's voting what bills and, you know, who's supporting what and what exactly is happening because, I mean, that's the only way we, me and you, I -- I think can stop it, you know.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  [MN]
L:  I -- I agree, absolutely, and then making them accountable after they get --
R:  Oh, of course.
L:  -- into office, making them accountable and say, "Hey", you know, "you told us you were going to do this and you haven't done anything about it".  [MN] But it goes -- I guess it goes a little bit beyond that when you get the people who are trying to do everything they can but then they don't get any cooperation from their, you know, the other people that, you know, in the House of Senate if -- if --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there's only a handful, that's not enough to get it passed.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, so, we have to get more people like you and I on the bandwagon and get them to open their eyes a little bit more and not be so [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] +lackadaisical --
R:  Yeah.  I think --
L:  -- and just --
R:  -- it's -- it's that and it's, um, [MN] you know, laziness like you're saying and, um, fear too.  Kind of just, people just knee jerk react and they do crazy stuff --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and just, you know, just 'cause they're so scared.  Something's gonna happen but they don't sit down and think it through --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- long enough --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, you know, especially when a whole, you know, bunch of crazy people out there in office are doing that, that's when it's really scary --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because it's not them who is really accountable because, you know, they're not -- they're not as accountable as if they were in the war fighting it.  You know, they have their --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- bunker cells are going to go under and they're gonna be fine, [MN] you know.  They're not afraid for their own lives.
L:  Exactly.
R:  So, [LIPSMACK] that is a tough call.  That's a very tough one, um, and it's -- it's a shame because, you know, the -- you vote on the President and that's like a o- -- [MN] -- ah, one vote, right?
L:  Right.
R:  And then the President decides he's the commander in chief, he elects all his, um, war heroes or whoever and we pretty much have no control over that, once the President's elected, you know, so we need to -- I mean --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- 'cause it's not like we're in charge of hiring or firing those people.
L:  Right, but we have to make him accountable.
R:  Exac- -- oh, yeah, so I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, [MN] it's ha- -- without getting into too much of a political debate [MN] it's really, um --
L:  It's -- it's really hard and -- and -- 
R:  You gotta be careful.
L:  -- you know, Joe Average on the street, "Well, what is my one voice gonna do?"
R:  Right.
L:  Well, it's not just his one voice.  It's one voice plus mine, plus my neighbor's, plus, you know, whoever else that we can convince and I think that's -- that's a big thing.  That's a big thing is trying to get -- convince people, I mean, just on a very local -- local level [MN] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that I've been involved with here, it's hard.  It's hard just getting a school approved and trying to get, you know, lights for the playing fields approved, let alone the entire nation trying to agree, um, and that's what makes this country the wonderful place that it is, is -- is we can agree to disagree --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and that's why we've got people over there fighting for these rights but the thing, if we don't agree [MN], um, is -- I'm sorry, I was distracted [MN] --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- um, w- -- if we don't agree, we -- a- -- we -- we decide to do nothing, um, we can't complain.
R:  No.
L:  You know, if you ha- -- if you decide to do nothing about it and just go along with whatever's approved, you have no business saying anything about it.
R:  Right.
L:  You can't, um, say well, he's wrong in doing this or that if you didn't agree with him --
R:  Right.
L:  -- if you didn't do anything to try to stop it.
R:  But it's pretty hard, you know, once your vote's been cast and you still do not win [MN], you know --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- just like, whatever, and that's it, you're stuck.
L:  But you did what you could.  
R:  Yeah, yeah, that's true.  But it's, you know, you -- you have a drive to wanna do more --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it's hard sometimes to know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, how to -- where to put that energy.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, [MN], I mean, you know, the -- war protests and, ah, anti bio war protests, I mean, that -- sometimes I think that is effective --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, [MN] th- -- it's a shame, though, that, you know, so many violent, you know, arrests and stuff come from that kind of stuff --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but that's like, seems like one of the most effective things to do other than voting, you know, and supporting your candidate and talking about it with people and finding out the facts and, I mean, it seems like it -- it becomes more just left to the intellectual arena and, ah, the discussion and debate arena.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, so ... and unfortunately they -- they just have so many radicals on the radio shows.  They're either completely right or completely left --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I guess 'cause people like to listen to it 'cause it fires 'em up one way or the other.
L:  That's very true.
R:  But it's not -- I --I don't, I don't know, and it gives people a warped impression of what the different candidates are like sometimes.  Um ...
L:  I think the really scary thing is, [MN] is people in other countries will listen to these protests and will listen to these selected, ah, right and left and think that because that's what they're hearing that's what everybody thinks --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when, in fact, it's not and so they get a warped impression of us and they, um, think that America is bad and we have all these --
