L:  Hello.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi [LAUGH].  This is, um, Ken.
L:  I'm Alice from Oregon.
R:  Oh, hi, Alice.
L:  Hello.
R:  I'm from, uh, Chicago.
L:  Oh.  I lived in a -- a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- oh, I think, Aurora for a while --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- about twenty years ago [LAUGH].  Okay, professional sports on TV?
R:  Yeah, do you want to talk [LAUGH]?
L:  I don't watch sports of any kind.
R:  I don't even watch TV [LAUGH].
L:  Oh [LAUGH].  Well, we're the wrong people for this, aren't we [LAUGH]?
R:  Well, not necessarily.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] We just have to talk for ten minutes.
L:  Oh, right, well?
R:  This is the first one I've done.  I don't know.
L:  Oh.  It's really pretty easy.  I've -- I think this is my third one and it --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  It's, um --
R:  It sounded like fun.  Well, it's nice to meet you.
L:  Well, it's nice to meet you.
R:  It is -- is there an echo or something?
L:  I don't hear it on this end now.  Sometimes the connection isn't real good.
R:  Oh.
L:  I have had a lot of noise on the line before --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- just from this call and it's difficult to understand the woman who does the automated phone call.  When she gives you the topic you are -- sometimes it's not very clear --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but I -- I did hear this one, something about, you know, your favorite sports and, uh, I've done one on hobbies and one on feelings on the Iraqi war and the other was on reality TV which a- -- we- -- uh, I don't watch that either but if you don't watch TV neither do you [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I, uh, well, I guess we could talk about the sports --
L:  Okay, what --
R:  -- since that's what we're supposed to talk about.
L:  What's your favorite sport?
R:  Well, I don't have a favorite sport [LAUGH].
L:  I don't either [LAUGH] and, uh, of course I can talk for hours because, uh, I absolutely think it's appalling what sports figures are paid.  Ninety million dollars for the latest one for -- from Nike --
R:  Oh, really?  Ninety million?
L:  -- just for -- yes, and he's just in high school.  Like, maybe he graduated this year --
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  "-- and all he has to do is, you know, go around and wear the Nike shoes and, uh, be their spokesperson and of course, you know, Nike is from Oregon and this Phil Knight who's the head of that he's -- he's always in the news and I think, "Where do they get the gall to -- to pay that much to these people [LAUGH]?  I just think there's so many other places that money could be better spent but obviously they feel it's worth it or they wouldn't -- wouldn't spend the money.  But that's scary to give that amount of money to a kid.
R:  Well, yeah, money is, um, is a pretty, uh, big subject these days [LAUGH].
L:  I know and they have no idea what to do with it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and if -- if they have good advisors that's just necessary.  If they don't it's just, you know.  They buy humvees and whatever else [LAUGH] and theatres and -- and huge, huge mansions.
R:  Well, I, uh, I mean, I felt -- feel like I'm kind of in the minority but there again people in Oregon from what I understand don't particular -- don't feel particularly want to, like, move to Chicago.  Uh [LAUGH] --
L:  No, no [LAUGH].
R:  Well, like, you -- you know, I -- I find the world pretty materialistic and -- and I feel pretty manipulated by wh- when I watch TV.  I was actually reading a book called How to Watch the TV News --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and it talks about how, um, the -- i- it's -- it's a lot like the old days where there were tents and they would try to, like, get people to spend their one thin dime to see the amazing, like, so and so and, like, they want to keep you in the tent --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- like TV wants to keep you there.  The -- and -- it -- no -- even sports.  They -- they make it so that it's just the most amazing thing that you don't even relax when you watch it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's like exhausting to kind of connect to those people.
L:  Yeah, I agree, and I also don't like -- I do watch the news and, uh, all the of- you know, their counselors say in your -- well, the film at eleven or --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- stay tuned for this wonderful breaking story.  Well, if it's that interesting tell it to me right now.  Don't tell me to wait until after all the commercials are over [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, they -- they -- they -- they would -- they totally went into that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, [NOISE] --
L:  I'm more attuned to getting my news from the newspaper anyway --
R:  Oh, my, uh, I --
L:  -- rather than --
R:  -- I -- I get it from the internet --
L:  Oh, I don't -- I --
R:  -- because I --
L:  I don't ever do that.
R:  I -- I mean, even the newspaper I find, um, it's too much reading [LAUGH] --
L:  Well, yeah, that's true.
R:  -- and, uh, I used to actually like to read the Christian Science Monitor but -- 'cause I found it pretty objective of the -- the reporting but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I haven't done that recently because once again I -- I tend to read it and it takes too long.
L:  Mhm.
R:  How do you keep from reading the whole thing?
L:  I don't.  I read the whole thing.
R:  I mean the, uh, newspaper.
L:  That's it.  That's it.  I love the newspaper.  When the Sunday paper comes I just consider it's going to take me an hour and a half at least to read it and I just, uh, provide for that time.
R:  Wow.
L:  Oh, no.  I just think it's wonderful.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I've read the Chicago Tribune when I was back in Illinois and, uh, now, of course, it's the Oregonian out here and if I travel I pick up their local newspaper always.  You know, if, uh, in the morning I'll usually go down -- for if I'm in a motel I go someplace for breakfast or coffee --
R:  You'll get the Oregonian, you mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, so you're really -- really a b- -- uh, quite an Oregonian [LAUGH].
L:  Well, yes, I am actually.  It's been a lot of years I've been here.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, another thing is, uh, you sound fairly young.  Perhaps it's the age.  I'm sixty five and, you know, when I was younger there was no television and, uh, of course, computers, wow, that's opened up a whole new world.
R:  [NOISE] Do you have a computer --
L:  Oh, yes --
R:  -- in -- in -- and --
L:  -- I do.
R:  -- and -- and you -- you -- you go browsing around.
L:  Yeah, I do, uh, but, uh, probably not as much.  In fact I've just been on the computer for, uh, thirty minutes trying to find some airline tickets from Portland to Denver.  I have to go to a family reunion in a couple of weeks and -- Now, that's exhausting.  I just want to call a travel agent and say, "Hey, get me these tickets ", [LAUGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- because there's so much available.
R:  Wait a second.
L:  You have to --
R:  You want to get tickets and you're on the computer trying to get them?
L:  Yeah, from, uh, United --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then I went to Continental and, um, it's great.
R:  You mean you -- you --
L:  I mean, you're getting --
R:  -- went from one website to the other?
L:  Yeah, for comparison.
R:  Oh, you don't have to do that.  Well, I guess you do.  Continental isn't -- I mean basically there's like Orbits and, um, and, uh --
L:  Trav- -- travelocity?
R:  Yeah, yeah, I, yeah, yeah, I mean, you -- you -- so you know about tho- those so you can, like, they get them all at the same time --
L:  Right.
R:  But, I don't know if Continental is included into Orbits.
L:  I kind of don't think they are and another problem I have is that when I get to Denver I have to take a commuter plane another hundred and fifty mile -- no, no, it's more than that.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's about four hundred miles to a small town called Cortez.
R:  Tha- that's where you live?
L:  That's where my --
R:  W- --
L:  -- family is from --
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  -- and that's it.  It's going to be a family reunion --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so, uh, there are -- nothing goes there except a very small plane so it was ch- -- trying to find connections so I didn't have to spend, like, six hours in Denver waiting for this smaller airplane to leave so I'm still working at it [LAUGH].  I don't know what I'm going to end up doing.
R:  [LAUGH] I -- I'd -- I -- I had a -- a nightmare story when I took a commuter plane out of Denver to Alamosa.  I don't know if you, uh, know where that is --
L:  Oh, sure.  I know where that is.
R:  -- and, um, I went on vacation and, um, a week later someone dropped me off at the airport and then I found out that the, you know, the -- the -- they, um, weather was perfectly clear.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I found out that, um, my plane wasn't running and they hadn't run for, like, like, five days --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- because of a hailstorm had damaged [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, no [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] like, every plane or something [MN], so I had to rent a car f- -- to -- uh -- in -- to go drive to Denver.  It cost me, like, three hundred and some dollars just to --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- drive one way because Alamosa is just the, uh, they don't have -- they -- they said that they have to fly a guy out there to bring it back --
L:  Oh, my word.
R:  -- so, [LAUGH] it was -- it was, um, a very expensive trip.
L:  Oh [LIPSMACK].
R:  They should, you know, er, I, uh, I fly in to Denver now.  So, um, let's see.  Maybe we should try to say ...
