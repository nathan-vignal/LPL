R:  [LIPSMACK] My name is Tim.  I'm from Oak Ridge, North Carolina.  Who am I speaking with?
L:  Hi, Tim.  This is Debbie.  I'm from New York.
R:  Ah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I was just up there --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- about a month ago.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yes.
L:  For business?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, I guess, you could say that.  I retired last June and I'm working for Penski Truck Rental Company --
L:  Oh, right.
R:  -- and I had to go --
L:  [NOISE] The -- that --
R:  -- up to --
L:  -- famous logo, Pen- --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- -- ski.
R:  Of all --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- places, I had to go to Long Island to pick up a tractor and bring it back to North Carolina.
L:  Oh, God, that's a long trip.
R:  I had my trip perfectly planned.  I was gonna get there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- at two o'clock and be off that island before the rush hour started.  Well, my --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- truck wasn't ready and I didn't get to leave 'til five and it took me three hours to go from mid, um --
L:  From where?
R:  -- from middle of the island to, um, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  To New Jersey?
R:  -- to Verrazano Bridge.
L:  To the Verrazan- -- to the tip of Brooklyn?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Wow. 
R:  But --
L:  I'm not surprised.
R:  But the upside of being in a traffic jam in New York City is you have time to read all the signs.  You're not whizzing by real fast and it was a clear day --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and I could see the skyline.  I could see all the stuff, you know and --
L:  A different skyline.
R:  And had a good [MN] --
L:  The new skyline.
R:  Yeah, it is.
L:  [LAUGH] Speaking of --
R:  That's, uh --
L:  -- bio terrorism [LAUGH], I figured I'd introduce myself as capital [NOISE] of bio terrorism target [LAUGH], New York --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- City. [SIGH] Um --
R:  Well --
L:  -- I think, uh, just to answer the question briefly, um, kind of an ironic answer is, if we wanted to -- to prevent a bio terrorism attack, it would be good if we could stop producing bio terrorism, so that people -- people that become our enemies, or are enemies, can't get their hands on them.
R:  Mean stop --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- producing the agents -- the --
L:  Yeah, that whole --
R:  -- viruses like anthrax --
L:  -- anthrax thing, it was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ridiculous that we are like -- and -- and the smallpox -- uh, we, I mean America -- is one of the only countries that stores that stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] In a -- in, um [NOISE] -- in a pure form, like in a scientific lab kind of form, 'cause I think if I understood correctly, anthrax nat- -- is naturally produced on a farm.  It produces itself.  I mean, it's -- it's, um [NOISE] -- do you know anything about anthrax?
R:  No, uh -- 
L:  I -- I didn't --
R:  -- uh --
L:  -- grow up on a farm but if I understood correctly, when this whole anthrax thing happened right around September eleventh, that it's [SIGH] something that you can --
R:  It's foot and mouth --
L:  It's a naturally --
R:  -- disease.
L:  -- occurring thing, isn't it?
R:  Yeah, well, it's in cattle.
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  But I -- I think you have really hit on a good point here with -- with your, um, assertion that we shouldn't even be producing and storing this stuff, except under very, very controlled circum- --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- -stances and very --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- very secure -- under very secure managers, um --
L:  Right, because the small -- I think the smallpox is another really good example.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Apparently, we eradicated it for -- for some, you know, bizarre reason -- uh, not bizarre [NOISE], I guess.  I can understand for scientific purposes, you want to hold on to a --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- sample of it for the future, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  But they held on to several samples and -- and here, in America and then -- what was then another super power, Russia but when [COUGH] -- excuse me -- the Soviet Union.  When the Soviet Union dissolved, now all those labs are, you know, not secure. [NOISE] Some of them don't even exist, have been ransacked, so samples of that, um -- of -- of the smallpox is now, God knows where. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you know what I mean?  So, it's not, you know -- I don't know.  I guess [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] ...
R:  Well, it's --
L:  I mean, it's the -- it's Russia's -- Russia at the time, [LIPSMACK] you know, had a right, I guess, for scientific reasons to hold on to it but when the country itself became unstable, someone -- someone from another country should have stepped in and, um, gotten those samples out of there.
R:  [LIPSMACK] But you know, um, [LIPSMACK] an- I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I -- I agree a hundred percent with what you're saying --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that the threats ought to be diminished or eliminated but are you old enough to remember the -- the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Tylenol incident?
L:  Oh, yes.  When the cap -- when -- that's -- that's after that happened, they all got plastic covers, right?
R:  Yeah, it was --
L:  Some crazy person was putting something in the --
R:  Yeah, they were tampering --
L:  Tampering.
R:  -- with the -- and it on- -- it was only a few bottles and -- and a f- -- and just a few people, either --
L:  Right.
R:  -- got sick or killed and it was [NOISE] -- you know, it was an American that was doing it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- eh, you know, someone bent on --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- causing [SIGH] terror [SIGH] --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- there is so many ways to do it.  Uh, the terr- -- uh, I think that Tylenol was a good example of how easy that product was, or any product at that time, was to tamper with but you could do the same thing to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a loaf of bread right now.
L:  Right.
R:  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and it would only take --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just a few --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, random --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, plannings of something that would harm someone and the Tylenol indus- -- uh, the, uh, manufacturers of Tylenol almost went out of business over that.
L:  But I thought the industry as a whole -- the pharmaceutical industry responded to that really well --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and now, you see not only safety caps for children but every -- a lot of things are wrapped in plastic and it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, "If -- if seals not -- if seal is broken, do not open" that kind of stuff.
R:  Yeah but you can take a syringe and go into many, many products now and tamper with them and interject some -- some --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- type of agent into them that would cause the same scare.  The -- that -- that company almost went bankrupt.
L:  Mhm.
R:  No one took a Tylenol for months and months after that.
L:  Right.
R:  Uh, and --
L:  I remember that.
R:  -- it was just -- it was just a -- a -- a few pills and, uh, how do you stop all the kooks in the world internal and foreign --
L:  Right.
R:  -- from doing something like that?  
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I don't know how a --
L:  Well, that kind of --
R:  -- person can do it.
L:  -- that kind of touches on the whole randomness of it [NOISE] all and -- an- and I believe there's -- that, [MN] uh, the bottom -- the question was about bio terrorism but in -- in a larger picture, it's very difficult, if not impossible -- in fact, I think it's mostly impossible to stop terrorism.  When people are hell bent on doing something, like, okay, [SIGH] you know --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- crashing planes into [LAUGH] buildings is a really extreme --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- example -- they will do it.  They will somehow -- that's why it's called terrorism, you know.  That's why it works.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I think there are steps governments can take to prevent terrorism.  Certainly, [LIPSMACK] I think there was a huge gap in security on September eleventh and, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [COUGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] um, so, [NOISE] there are things on a day to day basis, that American government can do, the INS could have done, etcetera.  Um, but bioterrorism, I mean, [SIGH] I -- you know, I'm not a biologist, I'm not a scientist, so I don't -- I don't know how would you administer a large dose of anthrax so that -- y- you know, 'cause I assume terrorists want to make like -- they want to damage a large percentage of the population, not just two or three people --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, in a pharmacy or something like that? [MN]
R:  Yeah, that's just --
L:  So, I don't --
R:  Putting the stuff in farms --
L:  -- know if it's really --
R:  -- too.
L:  -- preventable.  Huh?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  It's not.  Uh, it's not.  Uh, I just [LAUGH] s- so- something has to happen in the world to persuade men and women from harming each other --
L:  Each other --
R:  -- around the world.
L:  -- [NOISE] yeah.
R:  Uh, I think --
L:  You said it.
R:  -- I think -- I think our -- our best bet all the way around -- the best bang for our buck --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- is to promote peace in the world everywhere we can and get out of the business of -- and of course our country has made many, many mistakes --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and will make many, many --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- more but we seem to be the ambassador of freedom, at least, in the world --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and a lot of people are on our side with that now and enjoy --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- freedom.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and we are --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ambassadors of human rights and [LIPSMACK], uh, I think we've done many, many good things in the world and -- have the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- have the wealth and the power to do --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- as much good as --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- as -- as making mistakes, uh, so --
L:  I agree that we can -- uh, we have wealth and power.  How it's being used around the world, I think, is questionable.  And I think that's why it creates a lot more enemies than friends because I'm with you there.  I think one of the best ways to stop terrorism -- what is the root of terrorism?  Like, I -- and you know, after September eleventh -- 'cause I live right here, man.  I'm like a mile away from -- from the World Trade Center.  They [NOISE] -- you know, for like two nanoseconds, America reflected on itself.  Like, "Ew, why do people hate us so much?"
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, "What is it?" and then immediately, it went into like, "Who did this and how are we gonna crush them?" you know.  It went to like revenge mode.  But for that, uh, moment of clarity, you know, people were asking these questions and I agree with you that, you know -- you know, the root of that is to promote peace and [SIGH] -- and, um, I know I sound so idealistic that I sound like I'm eighteen, like, "Peace and love, dude" but [LAUGH] -- but we can.  It's like you said, we have the power, we have the money, we have the resources --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] but I -- I -- I think we're -- I don't know.  I think there's a lot of, um, [LIPSMACK] negative feelings towards America and -- and in many, many cases, it's -- it's, uh -- er, it's correct.  I mean, it's a correct perception that people have, that Americans are very aggressive, they're bullies, that [NOISE] American corporations really, is what --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'm talking about, not Americans.  See, that's the -- that's the funny thing.  Like, Americans are really cool people when --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you get to know them but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like our governments and our elected officials, the ones who make the foreign policy decis- --
