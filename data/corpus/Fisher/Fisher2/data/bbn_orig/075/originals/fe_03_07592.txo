L:  Uh, hello.  Uh, my name is George.
R:  Hi, I'm Tobia Narva.
L:  Leanarda?  That's a n- --
R:  Tobia.
L:  That's a nice name ma'am.
R:  Thank you.
L:  Uh, they -- they said the, uh, subject was a TV sport --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I guess, uh, sports in general or -- or is there something that a -- a -- a -- a sport that you like to watch on television --
R:  Um --
L:  -- and or -- or -- a -- mhm.
R:  Well, I don't know.  I go for --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I can watch basketball but, um, soccer maybe sometimes.  How about you?
L:  Mhm.  Well, I'm not much of a, uh, I'm not very sports oriented.  Haven't  -- haven't been since, uh, I was a -- a teenager and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ah, um, early on in, uh, I'm an older fella now -- early on in my adult, uh, uh, life I -- I traveled a lot and I didn't, uh, never developed much of a -- a TV watching habit anyway.  I'm a -- so -- so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I've kinda got two strikes against me and I -- and I'm not that --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- not very sports minded and I don't watch much television but, um, I don't like to, I mean, I ususally don't follow any major sport in -- but I like the championships, like, you know, the Super Bowl or the -- or the World Series or something.  I mean, when the -- after the whole --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- season's over then the final two best teams -- those are the games I like to watch.  But I -- I'm not a weekly, uh, avid fan, you know, uh ...
R:  Yeah.  I [inaudible] on the final championships though because that's when, uh, that's when, you know, tensions are really high and it's really important that people win.  I feel like, you know, fans are more rowdy and it just gets kinda more intense.
L:  Well, sure, I -- and not only that, the, uh, you've got the, uh, ah, basically probably better quality teams because, you know, the -- the teams themselves have -- have, uh, uh, you know, just, uh, process of elimination --
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's the best teams.
L:  Yeah, that's the -- so, that's the game of the year so to speak or that's the -- the, uh -- uh, the -- the height of the, you know, the ending of the whole season so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- yeah.  But as far as being a, uh, um, ah, having any kind of regular sport that I like to view on a -- on a regular basis, I -- I -- I can't think of any of them really.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, do you have any sports you like to watch just, like, regularly?
L:  Well, uh, um, I like to, uh, um, let's see; oh, I like, uh, uh, the, uh, gymnastic sports occasi- occasionally.  Uh --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- yeah, some of the, you know, the -- the more the -- the Olympic sort of things like that.  Ah, the --
R:  Watch the Olympics on TV?
L:  Oh, yeah.  Whenever it comes, ah, ah, not -- not totally from beginning to end, but, uh, yeah, I -- just --  
R:  Yeah.  That's a little bit too much TV.
L:  Yeah.  But I -- I usually -- usually catch those because there you got, uh, uh, you know, world records and things like that, you know, and striving -- watch- watching the -- watching the line go higher and higher slowly over the -- over the course of -- over the course of the decades, you know, and it --
R:  Yeah.  It's really incredible isn't it?  The people just keep getting faster and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- jumping higher and making --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- more points [inaudible]. 
L:  Yeah, they have it -- they have to -- they have to watch closely there -- there's -- they don- -- they don't have any artificial help, you know, and, uh --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- th- th- th- the -- the steroids and chemicals and things like that.  But there's a lot of drama there too because, uh, uh, you -- you're literally talking with, you know, six billion people on the face of the earth and you're saying, ah, you know, you maybe kind of a specialized thing but, you know, is this what -- this one thing -- you're the best human being [LAUGH] out of six billion --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, so, [MN] so, it sometimes --
R:  It's amazing.
L:  -- sometimes they're losing by, you know, a split second [inaudible] or -- or winning by a split second and it can be quite a bit of drama there too, you know, so ...
R:  Oh, yeah, definitely.
L:  Yeah.  The human, uh, uh, uh, drive, you know, you're emotions will sure provide a lot of, uh, a lot of drive in -- in -- and --
R:  Adrenalin and stuff.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Adrenalin.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Actually I think that's why people like watching --
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
R:  -- the, like, sports on television, 'cause it gives them sort of, like, a secondary adrenalin rush, you know.
L:  Well, sure.  Sure it's a vicarious experience for sure.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.
L:  Yeah, uh, yeah that's a bit of a, uh, uh, uh, a kind of a -- a -- well, like you say, uh, uh, they all secondary experience the other -- they're --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they're -- they're basically, uh, just [PAUSE] uh, well, you know, ah, as -- as -- as human beings we kinda find ourselves feeling alone and if a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- any, you know, any kind -- any time you see someone else emoting, you know, exhibiting an emotion th- that's something we can identify with, it kind of makes us feel not alone so, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when people like I -- it's like I told my twelve year old daughter, I said, "People will pay any amount of money to feel anything" you know --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you know, yeah, I mean, it's good or ba- --
R:  Does she -- does she watch sports on TV?
L:  Pardon me, ma'am?  Does w- --
R:  Does she watch sport?
L:  Do I watch sports on television?  Not really --
R:  No, does she?
L:  Oh, oh, oh, does she?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, do you watch sports on television?  [NOISE] Th- this lady would like to know.  She says --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- she says -- she says, ah, sometimes.  I don't think she's -- I don't think she's -- [NOISE] yeah, just the big things, yeah.  [NOISE] She -- she kinda likes baseball she says, yeah.
R:  Oh, yeah, I like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- baseball sometimes too.  My boyfriend --
L:  Yeah.
R: -- is really into that.  He loves all --
L:  I -- 
R:  -- like, football, basketball, baseball, anything, he watches.
L:  Well, I was going to say out of the baseball, uh, basketball or football, I'm -- I'm more, uh, uh, a -- f- [inaudible] yeah, uh, football is more, you know, more my, uh, uh, I like it better than i- i- -- than any of them, you know, like I -- I got --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- an invite -- well, I was there, uh, you know, I still am -- I've always been a very heavy set, stocky, you know, very, uh, you know, as I say big boned type person and --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and in school, you know, the grade school, the younger -- younger grades, I was kinda ridiculed for it but when we reached adolescence all of a sudden it's like, "Hey --"
R:  I'll be on the football team!
L:  "-- put him on our football team".  Yeah I, like, and I just walked from one end of the -- their -- their -- their -- their field to the other with guys hanging on me, you know, they couldn't knock me down.  [LAUGH] It was -- it was, like, "Hey, I'm good at something" you know, so --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- and -- and, ah, well, not that I was on the team very much, you know, there, uh, like I said, I never have been very sports, uh, uh, minded --
R:  Oriented. 
L:  -- because well, I -- I do -- I have other interests, you know, that were -- they're -- they're kind of really -- really outweighed tho- -- the sports but the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- football I can -- I can at least understand.  I know what's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- going -- yeah, and -- and, uh, you know, for, uh, and the, uh, the -- the maneuvering and things, you know, uh, the, you know, the long pass or, you know, or -- or the -- the short -- the short pass, you know.  Basketball is -- is almost painful for -- for me to watch 'cause when I played basketball in high school, I'd make it to the top of the key -- to the top --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of the key because back before I was running around and they would have the play and were coming back at me [inaudible] before I got down to [LAUGH] where they were and I'd turn around, you know, it was, like, [MN] you know.
R:  Oh, man.
L:  Yeah.  I didn't -- I didn't play much basketball but, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- still not --
R:  It's true though.  Like, I -- I played track in high school, or I ran track and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and I can actually watch it on television, which most people can't.  It's way too boring. But, like --
L:  Mm.
R:   -- because I did it, you know, I can feel what's going on, I feel the tension and everything.
L:  mhm.
R:  And I understand it more so, I actually enjoy watching it, like --
L:  Oh, sure.
R:  -- for the Olympics but ... 
L:  Yeah, uh, uh, I was on, uh, for -- for a couple of weeks I was on the, uh wrestling team the Greco Roman type -- type thing and --
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  -- you know, yeah, that would of -- I like to, uh, you know, that's -- that s what I say, th- the what I liked, uh, uh, you know, watch it -- I don't watch it on a regular basis, but some of the more unusual events, you know, some of the -- s- some things like that, uh, uh, or maybe, um, you know, the, uh, the Tour de France on the bi- -- on the bicycles is, you know, stuff like --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- yeah, you know, and I'm not a, you know, but -- but just the -- just the -- the -- ah, individual, uh, events, you know, uh, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they say, uh, the -- the car racing and then the NASCAR and stuff like that is a -- it kind of -- kind of been ringing true of sport type, uh --
R:  But that is something that seems so boring to me to watch -- cars driving around --
L:  Is that for the whole car racing?
R:  Yeah, I can't do that.
L:  Automobile racing.  Well, I'm not -- I -- I don't follow it but, uh, there again the big ones, you know, like the Indianapolis was -- was fun.  I had it on -- I was doing other things but I was passing through watching the -- the whole thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  A friend of mine was telling me they've -- they've -- they've, uh, uh, put so many restrictions and -- and devices and stuff on those engines that they've -- they've just about, uh, leveled out the -- the performance from -- from one car to the next so that they're  --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- they're starting to have an element of -- an element of the skill of the drivers is -- is starting to become more important now --
R:  And not just the -- the make of the car.
L:  -- yeah, just -- yeah, because you know, uh, that -- that was kind of a -- for a long time it was like they were -- they were working off technological advancements.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Now one team would come up with a technological advancement and they would dominate the field for several years but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- now they've got -- they've got all kinda, you know, governed out and now all that stuff and limited down to where, uh, as far as what you're getting out of the -- the cars, it's about the same but so, therefore the -- the skill of the drivers starts coming into play.  I think that has a lot to do with it gaining popularity because then the drivers themselves be- -- are -- are becoming personalities, you know, and --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Like, the big sports stars and everything.
L:  That's right.  Yes, still a ... 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Uh, uh, you know, I -- like I say, I -- I don't, uh, I'm not a regular, uh, I guess you could call me a -- a -- a jack of all trades when it +comes to watching TV sports, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If I wanna --
R:  I don't ev- -- know if that's anything that you ever really master.
L:  Oh, no, no.  Yeah, I mean, n- nothing that I -- nothing that I would consider a hobby or -- or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or -- or -- or an enthusiast.  You know, I don't ...
R:  Yeah, me -- me neither.  I just -- doesn't really do it for me.
L:  Yeah.  I don't -- I'm not painting myself one --
