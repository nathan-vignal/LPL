L:  Hi, this is Brett.
R:  Hi Brett, this is Kate.
L:  Hi Kate.  Um, [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Do we just start talking?
R:  Sports on TV, right?
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Um --
R:  Where are you from?
L:  I'm from Philadelphia.
R:  Oh, cool.  I used to live in Phila- -- well, in -- Washington's Crossing, Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh, yeah.  In --
R:  Literally.  Really.
L:  Did I talk with you on the phone --
R:  For seventeen years -- no.  Uh-uh, I haven't spoken to you.
L:  Okay.
R:  Unless, like, I put -- on a business level for some other reason.
L:  Okay.  I'm not sure.
R:  I went, um --
L:  Um, anyway, um, so, do you watch sports on TV?
R:  Yeah.
L:  W- what do you watch?
R:  Well, I've been watching the Mariners for now three years.  And I --
L:  Yeah, I don't --
R:  -- never watch baseball.  This is the first really time that I've ever watched baseball for that length of time.  So, it's become very addicting as much as -- just that the theatrics of it, the camaraderie and -- amazing to me.  The synchromesh[?]; just how everything is just -- and when it's on it's on.  They're -- when they're, like, keyed in to be, like, just perfect players, it's just so amazing to watch.  And yesterday was a phenomenal game and they had been -- one of the players hit two thousand hits for the team I guess.
L:  Who was that?
R:  His -- his two thousandth hit.  Was, uh, a man named +Olerud -- +Olerud.  Or [inaudible]
L:  Oh, John +Olerud -- John +Olerud.
R:  +Olerud -- +Olerud. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  And he hit, uh, his two thousandth hit so, that was just splendid.
L:  [MN] 
R:  It was just -- and it's just like -- just like nothing.  It's like butter, you know.  It's like cutting through but- -- it's, like, for him it's so -- it's not even like the other players that really hit the ball.  He just hits the ball.  You know, [LAUGH] it's a whole different strategy, I mean, it's just really neat.
L:  Do you -- do you live in Seattle?
R:  Pardon -- yeah, I've been in Seattle for three years so --
L:  [MN] 
R: -- um, I -- I -- I've only gone to two other baseball games that I remember but I've been a football aficionado 'cause my relatives are really into it.  Especially with Philadelphia.  They were -- my uncles just totally --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- into the Eagles and stuff.
L:  It's hard not to be when you live in Philly.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think, um, it's a toss up for me between football and hockey.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  They're my favorite sports to watch on TV. But I think I have to take football, just because you only get one game a week, you know.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Um -- 
R:  Yes, and I've only seen one live hockey game.  It was pretty thrilling.  I've never -- I played hockey but -- field hockey -- you know, as a kid in -- at Pennsbury and it was really amazing, you know.
L:  On Pennsbury?
R:  Yeah, that's where I went to school.
L:  Yeah.  I've played ice hockey.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh!  Yeah, well, I went to a game in Lawrenceville, saw ice hockey game and it was pretty cool.  They have a really neat rink.  And, uh, it's --
L:  Or -- oh yeah, I know where it is.
R:  At Lawrenceville, prep school.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, that was really exciting to see hockey live.  It's pretty thrilling.
L:  The -- yeah, ho- hockey -- I like to watch hockey because [PAUSE] [LIPSMACK] and don't get me wrong, uh, I think baseball's a great sport 'cause I like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- baseball too, but --
R:  It can get awful boring.
L:  -- I like the amount of action.  Yeah.
R:  You know, when it's boring it can be boring.  And if you're not in the mood --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- for it, no matter what you do, it's not going to, you know, it's not going to put you in [LAUGH] the mood for it.  But I mean, I've been so into it it's just like, it's like a -- I have to sleep in order so, I'll watch -- so, I can watch the game, you know.  I have to make sure --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I'm up for the game.  [LAUGH] I always want them to win no matter [LAUGH] what.  But I've been real, like, 'cause of -- well, we almost won the series, you know, and if we'd have just put the right pitchers then we would have won so, I was so teed off at the -- at the coach 'cause he didn't put --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- the right players in so ... 
L:  Right.
R:  But now we're getting them --
L:  Talk a- -- talk about -- talk about win- -- [LAUGH] talk about not winning championships there [LAUGH] I mean, Phily's won it, you know, an awfully long time [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.  It must be kind of d- depressing.  But then didn't they win something the other day?  Were they having a hard time with the baseball too or ... 
L:  Well, we weren't -- we win games but we don't win championships.
R:  Yeah, right.  [SIGH] It's a matter of players.  It's just a matter of how many players just, you know, it's just the right recipe for players and I -- I don't know --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- I haven't any -- you know, I've never really watched it, except for the Yankees, you know.  When I lived in Pennsylvania we used to listen to it on the -- in the bus going home, you know, with the World Series.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that's pretty much about all I ever really remembered listening to it.  You know, we're not -- we didn't really watch that much of it 'cause there really wasn't that much television when [LAUGH] I was a kid.  But, uh, you know, it just -- it's -- now it's become like a -- a, you know, it's very big leg.  But maybe --
L:  You -- you have a basketball team [inaudible] 
R:  -- aren't they going to build new fields for y- -- aren't they building a new stadium for you guys too?  
L:  Two of 'em. 
R:  Isn't it -- are you -- are they building a new stadium --
L:  Well, we --
R:  In Philly?
L:  -- got a new football stadium for this year and --
R:  And --
L:  -- we're going to have the new baseball stadium for next year.
R:  Yeah.  That's what I thought.  I thought I heard that coming on, you know, because I know that this whole new feeling about stadiums is, like, really paramount for the team, because everybody plays for the stadium now.  I mean, like, the Giants and -- and the -- and the Camden yards and th- -- you know, how, like, fit into the stadium and, like, in -- in Boston the -- the stadium is -- it's almost -- you go to -- it's like a pilgrimage.  You go to [LAUGH] see the stadium more --
L:  True.
R:  -- than you go to see the game but then the game is part of the stadium, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so, the cheering becomes really, [PAUSE] um, you know, pretty much what you have to do [LAUGH] when you go there.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I gonna miss -- have a hundred level at the -- at the vettin[?].
R:  Oh, really?
L:   Yeah.
R:  But that's really cool though. Why would they -- why did they -- just, uh, not enough people?  I mean, they couldn't get enough --
L:  It's falling apart.  There's --
R:  Oh, really.
L:  -- there's a lot of things wrong with it.  Um, [LIPSMACK] the, uh, that turf has ended so many careers in professional sports [LAUGH] --
R:  Wow!
L:  --  'cause of how bad it is.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, now, um, yeah, [inaudible] same.
R:  Are they going to do a really nice one?  Did you see the specs for it?
L:  Oh, yeah.  It's [inaudible] --
R:  Oh, good.
L:  Absolutely phenomenal.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  Yeah.  [inaudible] 
R:  Gonna take --
L:  [inaudible] [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really?
L:  [MN] Yeah. 
R:  I -- I -- is it really close to ninety five?
L:  Yeah, it's, like, right next to it.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  Kinda where JFK used to be I guess.
R:  Is that down near the bridge, near the Camden bridge?
L:  Camden?  Um --
R:  Well, the one that -- yeah isn't there a bridge that goes with Benjamin Franklin bridge?
L:  Oh, no, it's further, um, it's, um --
R:  Further down?
L:  It's almost, you know, it's towards the airport.
R:  Oh, well, you know, where that -- where you go over for the airport?
L:  Yeah, towards the airport, right.
R:  To go -- to cut over for the airport?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, they had a lot of space down there for the diggers do a lot of landfill, huh?  Is that what they re going to do with it?  They got a lot of land down there anyway.
L:  I don't know, what they re doing but they got -- turned event into a parking lot.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, God, that's going to be cool.  So, it's going to be right next door, huh?
L:  Yeah.  So, yeah, so -- so when's Seattle getting a hockey team?
R:  I don't know.  Do they have a hockey team?
L:  Mm mm[?]  
R:  They don't?
L:  No.
R:  Well, that's kinda, uh, interesting.  And, you know, I didn't know that.  I -- I -- does Dakoma[?] have one?  Or Portland?
L:  Port- -- no.  They just have -- I don't think Portland has basketball.
R:  So, they don't have any -- there's no hockey in the whole state?  Washington doesn't really have a hockey team?
L:  Mm mm.
R:  Oh, that's weird.  I didn't know that.  I thought, you know, I just never --
L:  I think the only thing you have nearby is --
R:  -- you never saw.  I never saw a hockey game.
L:  -- I mean, I meant in Vancouver and Calgary.
R:  Yeah.  They're [inaudible] in the [inaudible] just like, Goldie Hawn's son plays at -- at, uh, Vancouver.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, they got a big team up there I guess for it, you know, they p- play somewhere professional so, I don't know how big the team is but it's a small  -- it's not a big city.
L:  Vancouver is not a big city?
R:  Argh, come see, come saw.  They got one down set -- they got one, you know, one downtown street.  Mean one -- sort of, like, this is the main drag street.  It's like the tall buildings --
L:  Talking about Vancouver, Canada, right?
R:  Yeah.  I went up to Whistler from there to go s- -- to -- up to Whistler.  That's really amazing.
L:  [MN] 
R:  It's really pretty you know, it's a really beautiful drive.  You can take the bus or you take the van up to Whistler.  It's just unbelievable.
L:  I can't [inaudible] 
R:  The fjords -- it's like these fjords, like, giant mountains that come down to the oc- -- to this waker[?] that -- or I guess the ocean right there, you know.  And you just drive alongside of it up to Whistler.  It's real spectacular.
L:  [MN] 
R:  I was never so scared in my life on a tram -- unbelievable tram --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- was li- -- it's like a -- a ninety degree angle.  It was really frightening.  It just -- it goes up to the top of some mountains so it's pr- -- I'm not, you know, kinda scary.  I mean, the scariest tram I've ever been on and I've skied everything in the east. 
L:  [MN] 
R:  And I went to Nepal and that wasn't even as scary as climbing [LAUGH] climbing going to the base camp of Everest wasn't as scary as the tram at Whistler.  That's how scary it is.  Anyway [LAUGH] --
L:  I want to ski Mount Hood.  [LAUGH] 
R:  You want to ski Mount Hood?  Absolutely beautiful.  I think it's supposed to be really nice.  It has beautiful snowfields.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You should come out -- we should go to Mount Hood and go skiing Mount Hood.  That's what we should do.
L:  Uh, oh, I don't get out there that often.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've like watching skiing on TV though.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] It's a good thing to do.
L:  Those people do a lot of things that I can't do.
R:  I would never even a- a- attempt it, you know.
L:  [MN] 
R:  With a skateboard I could, like, go back and forth between, you know, sidling down the sidewalk, I could sort of weave in and out but I could -- I would never put my foot down on my board and flip it over.  [LAUGH] I can't even imagine that, you know.  Like, beyond anything -- they -- they do stuff that I would never think a body could do.  But I don't like gymnastics much either 'cause I crashed my skull when somebody was supposed to spot me and they didn't.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, I -- I blacked out.  I just passed out and I fell back and hit my head.  So, I'm not really into gymnastics but, uh, I try to keep -- I like downhill.  Just not racing but just skiing, you know.
L:  Yeah.  Leisurely, yeah.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I -- I like it too.
R:  Yeah.  Just really having a good time just, you know, cutting the mustard, do a lot of vedlin[?]. I don't like the new skis at all.
L:  Really.  I'm -- I'm into ski boarding. They're as sure as --
R:  You like that?  Me, never!
L:  I love it.
R:  Ooh.
L:  It's great.
R:  God! 
L:  So easy.
R:  I think if you get -- if I were younger, I probably would have tried it but I just can't get my feet to go -- the board goes and my feet don't go, you know.
L:  Yeah, but the ski board -- oh, you're thinking of snow boarding.
R:  Oh!
L:  Ski board --
