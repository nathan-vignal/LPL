L:  Jay Ther[?].
R:  Hi.  [inaudible] Hayley. [PAUSE] Are you there?
L:  Yes.  Hi.
R:  Hi. [LAUGH] Okay.  Our topic is what the US can do to prevent bioterrorist attacks.
L:  Yes.  Yeah.  Um --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I wish I had the answer. [LAUGH]
R:  You're not by yourself.
L:  [LAUGH] Do you have any ideas?
R:  Well, [PAUSE] I think, um -- and this may be a long shot -- the first thing that the US need to do to prevent a bioterrorist attack is to find out who wants to attack us, what they want to attack, and why.  Now, I know that -- you know, we're hearing so much about Al Qaeda and a- -- you know, all that --
L:  Right.
R:  But there have been others along the way who were just as powerful and just as disgruntled at the United States.  So, I think we need to find out who our friends are and who our enemies are because they're beginning to look a lot alike.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] Yeah.  You're right.  And it's -- it's worldwide, you know, and --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- it's a small world.
R:  Right.  And getting smaller.
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.  So, [MN] that would be a good place to start.  Um, do you think that, ah, Homeland Security is a good agency to, kinda, get going on that or ...?
R:  I think the Homeland Security Agency has some serious problems as do all of our security agencies.  To me, number one is they each need to be policed by someone else who doesn't get paid by them, who doesn't have to answer to them.  You see what I'm saying?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, the trouble we've had with, say, the FBI and the CIA was they were the most powerful things in the United States so the agents started running wild doing what they wanted to do.  So, we need some way to, first of all, have some -- some -- some group over everybody.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, to -- to s- see what they're doing.  To make sure that they're not running roughshod, number one.
L:  Right.
R:  Number two ...  Have you been to the airport lately?
L:  Um, just drove by.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Just drove by?
L:  I haven't actually been in the airport.
R:  Well, you know, they're making this big to do about all the security measures.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  How in the world -- and I stood there in line a few weeks ago -- how in the world can you f- -- almost frisk me down with your little wand, go through my luggage, ask me to open up my purse, have me take off my shoes ...  You do all that to the average citizen and yet you've got people working for you who have no business there, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Just got outta prison for killing people, ah, not -- they're illegal aliens.  You see what I'm saying?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, see something is wrong there.  They need to, first of all, make sure that everybody that works for the airport is cool, which they're not doing.
L:  Right.
R:  So, checking -- checking us, you know, chaining[?] Joe Citizen's not the answer.  I don't have any way to make weapons.  If I did, I wouldn't anyway.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But the people who have the [inaudible] they work at the airport, they can put anything on that plane.  See what I'm say- -- even the people who check the luggage -- when they drive your luggage up there, who's to say that they're just putting your luggage up there?
L:  Right.
R:  So, they're not even checking themselves enough.
L:  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a good point.  And that's just one example of -- of many.  Um, you know, there's people that work in, ah, food distribution centers --
R:  Oh.
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  A- -- who could be putting stuff in food.
R:  Yes.
L:  Ah, you know, um, you mentioned airports -- how about the train stations, the bus --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- stations?  Ah, there's numerous, um, [PAUSE] places, ah, where we can be attacked.
R:  Right.  And it wouldn't take much.  You know what I'm saying?  One --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- little, um -- we, ah, don't know how quickly things spread but [LIPSMACK] one whatever, say -- like you mentioned food --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- if they put something in this -- [inaudible] anybody ever does any of these things but when you mentioned food I just thought about now, what kinds of food are used almost every day?  Milk.
L:  Yup.
R:  Things like milk and eggs and stuff like that -- they could destroy half of America without even blinking.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because people are using those things and even though we, um -- we safety wrap things and stuff like that --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- who's doing the safety wrapping?
L:  Right.
R:  So, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I- it -- it can be, kinda, scary actually.
L:  Sure.  You gotta have the -- the right people doing these jobs, you know?  And, ah, maybe some, kinda, tougher screening when people --
R:  Sh- --
L:  -- apply for these jobs or ...
R:  Right.
L:  You know?
R:  If you don't have time to check 'em out fairly then you shouldn't be hiring them.
L:  Right.  Yeah.  Yup.  Yeah.  That'd be a good place to start.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, you know, things like that -- transportation, food -- important a- areas like that.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, the thing is, ah, how about going after the culprits that are overseas?
R:  Oh, man.
L:  You know?  Where --
R:  Ha- --
L:  How far do you go there?  What do you do there?  Ah ...  You know?
R:  You know that ... [SIGH] That's getting to be, ah, quite a full time, ah, job just trying to chase down the people in the other countries who're trying to cause all this major disaster.  It almost makes you wanna say, "Let's go back to a time when we were s- -- more self sufficient".
L:  Mhm.
R:  We didn't need anything from overseas for our people -- we're here -- we're just -- you know I'm saying, it's just -- it's just so hard.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I feel real bad about when we go to war.  Regardless of when we go because from my standpoint, we're losing a lot of lives -- American lives -- destroying a lot of American families, um, and looks like we're coming up empty handed.  You know, w- -- it's like, what are you fighting for?  Are you fighting so that those people can vote?  Is that more important than fighting so that our children will have their parents with them?  You know I'm -- I think we -- we spend a lot of money and a lot of time trying to secure other people borders when our borders are just as bad off as theirs in some instances.
L:  So, you're saying in, ah, start here at home first? A- and --
R:  Start at home first.
L:  Yeah.
R:  As a matter of fact, we could -- now this is just -- this is just me -- we could for, say, a month -- 'cause the government can move fast -- a month or two or three months actually close our borders to any --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- non American, non --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- essential --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- foreigner just so we could do a sweep and just -- and have that -- I mean -- understood.  I don't care if you don't like it, if you think it's unconstitutional.  What we wanna know is what have you got here that could --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- hurt our people?  That's all we wanna know.  I don't care where you're from -- that doesn't matter.
L:  Mm.
R:  But if you've been going to the m- -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- whatever place they go to buy -- buy terroristic things, okay?
L:  Mhm.
R:  If -- but if you've been buying whatever it takes to make --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- dirty bombs, then we're gonna bring you on the carpet.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  We're gonna see what --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you're doing with it.  Why?  How do you know how to work with this?  If you're a chemist from another country then we need to put you under c- -- surveillance if you've been buy- -- you know what I'm saying?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Look and see what we already have here.
L:  Right.
R:  And then when we can sweep of our problems -- take care of some of our problems before we let in more.  Because what -- I'm sure we're letting in more potential terrorists every day.
L:  Yeah.  It's a scary thought. [SIGH]
R:  It is a scary thought but I'm telling you -- if you've ever been at the border -- have you ever been at the border?
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] Yup. [NOISE] 
R:  I said, um, I was needing to get from, just, Mexico back to Texas.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And what happened was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I went with a field trip --
L:  Yup.
R:  -- and we were getting ready to go and everybody's being checked out and we were actually --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- getting ready to get in our van on the other side and we had to all come back.  Everybody from our van had to come back.
L:  Hm.
R:  One individual had liquor in her purse.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Now, I -- this is something I learned and I've stopped -- and I stopped, ah, working with -- with kids on field trips -- except for church kids --
L:  Yeah.
R:  This person was sixteen, number one.
L:  Huh.
R:  I didn't know that.  So, they said she was under age.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But see, over here, she's not under age because she was a mother with a child.
L:  Really?
R:  And you're automatically an adult.
L:  Hm.
R:  So, that was it.  Conflict of the rules.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  But because she had liquor, they levied a fine and we had been shopping all day so we couldn't even get together enough money to pay the fine.
L:  Hm.
R:  We had to call her father in San Antonio and wait for him to drive to Mexico with the money so we could all leave.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Well, I've seen them do that over something small like that -- that was in her purse.  They could certainly do better screening of other -- and I mean, on some of the, um -- I don't know.  I guess they call them guards?  I don't know what they are -- those border patrol people.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They were just, kinda -- kinda, walking around -- milling around, like -- you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And others were acting like it was m- -- a more serious job.  So, what I'm saying is the borders need to be truly policed.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  You need to check everybody the same way.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And if you find anything suspicious then you need -- don't even let it past.  You need to check on it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  When there's talking about --
