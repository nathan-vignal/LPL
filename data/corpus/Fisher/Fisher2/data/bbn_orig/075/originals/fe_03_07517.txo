L:  Hi.  My name is Marcus.  Um, I'm from Florida and I'm a graduate student at U.F.
R:  Hi.  My name is Michelle and I'm from New York. [PAUSE] Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  Ah -- [PAUSE] okay. [LAUGH]
R:  So, we're supposed to be talking about, um --
L:  Um, bioterrorism.
R:  Yeah.  What can the US do to prevent it?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I know that --
R:  Absolutely nothing to me. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Well, that's true.  I mean, you could bring a petrie dish in with anthrax on it and nobody would know.
R:  That's -- exactly.
L:  But they do, supposedly, have, um, [PAUSE] like, [PAUSE] configure[?] -- l- -- um, detectors that would detect, like, contaminants in the air --
R:  W- --
L:  -- placed around the US.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  But I don't know how much that would do unless somebody released it --
R:  It -- uh --
L:  -- from a plane or something.
R:  It -- it -- ah -- i- -- to me just nothing.  I- it's nothing --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that you can do.  Um, i- is -- jus- -- already been shown and proved, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, just a regular, everyday person just coming through, you know, could be carrying something.  So, there's nothing nobody can do.  Even on your own, you know, turf -- people that is raised and born here, I mean, could do something.  So --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to me, nothing -- there's nothing the US can do, basically, to prevent it. [PAUSE] 
L:  I mean, o- other than -- I mean -- yeah, you're right.  I- if they're here already then there's nothing really you can do.  But I mean, if they're coming on a plane, maybe you can do some, kind of, sterilization of luggage.  I don't know.
R:  True.
L:  But then --
R:  But, um, still, there's human contact and lack of security and, ah, good security and I mean, you would have to x-ray a person from head to toe, ah, basically and -- h- -- you know, people have s- sneaky ways of doing things.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, the -- 
L:  Hm.
R:  We[?] become[?] an employee of the airlines.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, ah -- just -- you know, we're living in the last days anyway, as the Bible says.  So, there's really nothing nobody can do.
L:  Yeah.  I guess the only thing you can do is do something ha- -- be prepared for it if it happens.  I mean, you know, if somebody's gonna introduce smallpox then have smallpox vaccine made up.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Or have, you know, good treatment facilities for anthrax.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's all you can do.
R:  True.  But you know, even in New York, there has been the outbreaks of certain things and nobody knows w- what it is --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- where it came from, um ... [PAUSE] You know?  And only thing you could do is, like, shut down a whole hospital, ah --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But once the people are in contact with it, that's it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  M- -- pretty much.  And one day it'll be something that is -- cannot be controlled.  So, you know, everybody has to walk around in a -- in a suit.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Everybody has to get a suit.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  Every home has to be equipped with that.  They have to find a way to -- if it's airborne, not to let it come into your house.
L:  Right.
R:  It -- it's, ah, crazy.  It's in the air, um -- it would cause billions of trillions of dollars for the United States, ah, to be able to protect each and every person.
L:  Right.  Yeah.  I mean, it's not like you can predict what's gonna happen anyways.  I mean, like you could [SIGH] -- a car accident could happen the next day.  I mean --
R:  That's right.
L:  Millions of people die in car accidents every day.
R:  M- -- true.
L:  But we're not, like -- I don't know.
R:  True.  So, um -- [PAUSE] yeah.  It -- to me is -- it's -- things already happened already.  I mean, I'm thinking about this topic I'm saying, "Stuff already happened" you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Like, I know that -- I mean, I went -- I'm a -- in entomology, i- insects --
R:  Right.
L:  And I went to, um, a conference and they were like -- the people that work with, like, genetics and bacteria, they were, like, "Well, you know, you can't talk about this, you can't talk about this".
R:  Uh-huh. Huh.
L:  They're -- they're telling people you can't talk about, like, how you do your research now because they think people are gonna take that back.
R:  Right.
L:  But people already know that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, to culture anthrax and those kind of bacteria and viruses -- it's such common knowledge already.
R:  D- -- exactly.
L:  It doesn't matter.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  But --
R:  And th- that's what those other worlds do anyway.  They just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, they're raised on trying to figure out a way to get around things, you know?
L:  True.
R:  What is the weak point?  What is the weakness of the United States?
L:  Right.
R:  They study that.  That's -- that's [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's their purpose in life.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know?
L:  Wow.  Yeah.
R:  How can we tear down the United States of America?
L:  Mm.
R:  You know?  So, that to me is -- is really nothing a person can do.
L:  Right.
R:  Um --
L:  I don't know. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LIPSMACK] So, ah, I don't know what else they would tell[?].  To me this is just a, basically, short topic.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, not much to discuss on this topic. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh ...  If we try to come up with an idea, regardless, somebody's gonna find n- -- a way around it.
L:  That's true.
R:  And you know there's gonna be a hole somewhere.
L:  Yup.  I mean, especially with something like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, with, like, a nuclear bomb, it's a little bit easier to detect.
R:  That's right.
L:  But with something that's, like -- I don't know.  Anyways, I mean, with -- look at SARS -- SARS is like a mutated form of some other virus.
R:  Mhm.  Exactly.
L:  It is -- they just change by themselves anyways.
R:  That's right.
L:  So, it's [LAUGH] ... [PAUSE] I don't know.
R:  You know, ah, and, ah, [PAUSE] there's nothing nobody can do once it starts.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know?  There's just shutting down certain places and that's it.  But um, to me, those are -- those are light cases.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, well, when somebody really wanna, you know, come on a New York City subway to do something -- when somebody's ready, they'll do it and there's nothing nobody can do about it.
L:  But I mean, like, we're, like -- we must be one of the -- we're one of the safest nations as far as, like, sicknesses.  I mean, we don't have malaria --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and stuff like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean --
R:  Y- you're right.  We just get all of --
L:  A lot of --
R:  -- these new stuff, you know?
L:  [MN]
R:  Like the -- the Nile -- what river?  River Nile disease or --
L:  The West Nile?
R:  Yeah, the West Nile. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, all of this, you know -- stuff that insects are coming up with --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- over here and ...  And people travel all over and bring stuff --
L:  Right.  That's the problem.  Yeah.
R:  -- back here and, ah ...  See, I live in New York where everything happens so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, there's no protection on the subway.  We don't go through -- through a -- any scanner or anything, you just jump on the subway.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  You know?
L: Yeah.  I'm from the DC area so, I mean, I went on the -- yeah -- I know what you're talking about.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I mean, it's -- it's -- with all the people we have here and all the ways in, it's hard to protect against something like that.
R:  And that's right.  Exactly.
L:  Yup.  But --
R:  You know?  The -- only -- on- only God could do something about it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's all I can say.  Ain't nothing the United States can do.
L:  Yeah.  Huh.
R:  Well, that's basically it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know?  Should be almost over. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um --
R:  Oh, okay.  This is your -- ah, how many times have you done this so far?
L:  Ah, this is my second time.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  This is my third time.
L:  Yeah.  Usually I'm not home.
R:  Oh.  O- okay.  I -- I just usually just call first.  I just don't like surprises like, ah -- 'cause you're not the first person I'm speaking to on this topic.  The first person hung up on me.
L:  What?
R:  I was like, "Okay". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  She was like, "What was this?  What you want?"  And I'm, like, "Well, what's she talking about?  She's the one that called in?"  But I forgot that the -- sometimes people can get the calls.
L:  Yeah.  That's what -- yeah.
R:  Yeah.  So, she must a didn't know or she was thrown off. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, boy. [LIPSMACK]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  So, ah ...
L:  [MN]
R:  Whoever's listening to this or is gonna listen to it --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- to me, the United States just can't do anything [SIGH] for anybody.
L:  [MN]
R:  They can't even protect themselves.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LIPSMACK] You know? [PAUSE] Basically.
L:  Mm.
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  But --
R:  So, ah -- 
L:  [several inaudible words] [PAUSE] 
R:  That's it with this topic.  Pretty much.
L:  Pretty much.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Hm.
R:  Mm -- yeah. [LIPSMACK]
L:  Yeah.  I mean, it doesn't really --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't know.  It doesn't really seem to -- to me, it just doesn't have any more of an impact than other thing that's going on.
R:  Mm.  No.  Not at all.
L:  No.
R:  And with the reports of wars and wars and wars, I mean, there is nothing nobody can do.
L:  No.
R:  Just sit back and see what happens.
L:  [LAUGH] Mm.
R:  And that's it. [PAUSE]
L:  But --
R:  Oh, well.
L:  [MN]
R:  Ah, w- where you say you're from?  D- -- are you from DC?
L:  Um, that's where I used to be from.
R:  Oh, you're Florida.
L:  I'm from -- I'm in Florida now.
R:  You're in Florida.  Okay.
L:  Going to school.
R:  Oh, must be nice out there.
L:  Yeah.  It's pretty nice.  It gets a little bit hot in the summer.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But um --
R:  We haven't gotten those real hot days yet here in New York.
L:  [LAUGH] We have.  We've had, like, high nineties.
R:  Oh, no.
L:  Yes.
R:  It's been raining here a lot.
L:  Yeah.  It rains here a lot too.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But in the summers it rains, like, almost every --
