R:  -lo.
L:  Yeah, hello.  Th- --
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  This is Mary.
R:  Oh, my name is Mary also.
L:  [LAUGH] [MN]
R:  Where are you from?
L:  Ah, ah, East Dubuque, Illinois, up the -- the Mississippi River --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- ah, a- across the river from Dubuque, Iowa.
R:  Okay.  Well, I'm from Michigan, um --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- just outside of Detroit.
L:  Yeah, oh.
R:  Saint Clair Shores.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, what -- what do you think of the, ah, th- --
R:  Well, hang on a minute.  Let me go in the other room.
L:  Okay.
R:  [NOISE] Whoops.  [MN] My husband was chopping vegetables. [MN]
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I heard they said the topic was, ah, bioterrorism.
L:  Yes.  Ahah.
R:  Okay, what d- -- did they say something else, 'cause I didn't hear them?
L:  No, [MN] just about what kind of a phone you were using or that.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And that you can make comments after we're through talking.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Okay, but, [MN] ah, I don't know.  I think that they're pretty much cover- covering all the bases as is, except perhaps the bor- -- they could do more at the borders like with Canada and Mexico. [MN] The, but, ah, you know, I mean, the trucks and that just come in from Mexico, ah, [MN] with, ah, just stopping at the border there and coming right straight across and, who knows, I mean, what they could be carrying in the trucks, you know, or, ah, from Mexico that --
R:  Well, that's true.  I mean, we have a border rate here, um --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- going from, um, Detroit into Windsor, Canada --
L:  Yeah, yeah, that's right.
R:  -- you know, and it's a major border and we have one going from, um, [LIPSMACK] Port Huron, Michigan into Sarnia, Canada.
L:  Oh, yeah, we went through from Detroit over when we went over one time. 
R:  Right. [MN]
L:  But, ah, [MN] ...
R:  Yeah, I mean, they've tightened up and everything but, and I mean, you have to take a birth certificate now which you never used to take.
L:  Oh, no, uh-uh.  Ye- --
R:  But, um, I, you know, personally, I think that if anybody wanted to, um, put something into your water system or --
L:  That'd be terrible.
R:  Yeah.  I think they probably could, [MN] you know.
L:  Yeah, without -- without any problem because, I mean, they could carry some kind of a chemical in mostly anything, you know, in an overnight bag or a -- a backpack or something like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah ...
R:  I mean, hopefully there aren't, um, a lot of loonies out there.  I mean, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if you look back to when they had the Tylenol scare, you know, when --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- when somebody put stuff in the medication on a m- -- on a -- a subway line --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and -- and killed a few people, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um --
L:  But I'm always afraid, you know, if we do something to arouse the countries in the Middle East too much that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, that they -- they may come over here to, ah, you know, to try to commit some acts. [COUGH]
R:  Right.  It's -- I -- I mean, I know that the United States is doing everything they can and if they tighten up a whole lot more then our own freedoms are going to taken away.
L:  Yeah, they are, that's true, our -- yeah.  And, ah --
R:  And, I mean we used to go to Canada a lot.  In the summertime there was a park there that we went to all the time on Lake Erie [MN] and it's just kind of a pain now, there's a lot of traffic going across the border and, um, [LIPSMACK] we just don't bother.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, we -- there's parks that we can go to here now but we really miss it.
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, but it's just that there's too much traffic and the l- lines are long getting across --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, um --
L:  Yeah, that would be a detr- -- deterrent from, you know, going too often or that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And there was --
R:  Yeah, you know, and so we just, you know, I -- I suppose if we were younger we'd go, "Oh, what the heck" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- oh, but you get older and you just say, "Oh, I don't wanna be bothered". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah, well, that's it and I'm not a nighttime driver any more either but I was reading a g- -- a good article in the Reader's Digest about, [MN] ah, these Indian tr- trackers --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- and, you know, how they patrol the border and how they, ah, [MN] looking for drugs and the old eagles coming across or anybody that may have, ah, [MN] something else on their minds, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It, ah, it was really a good article and that and, ah, I read a few parts for the second time. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] Well, you know, I don't know.  I mean, I know the people at the border -- the border guards are very well trained --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, I mean, they've got dogs and things like that.  I mean, how do they know?  I mean, with the number of people that go through --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- the border every day and in Mexico it's even more.
L:  Yeah, yeah --
R:  Um --
L:  -- they don't c- -- try --
R:  -- how do you pick out the one that's got --
L:  They don't clamp down on 'em like you -- like we would here or something that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ah, but --
R:  I mean, it can be the most clean cut person in the whole world --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- coming through and, um, or it could be the most scuz- -- scuz bum of the world --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and, y- -- I mean, how do you know?
L:  Yeah, yeah, you just don't.  That --
R:  And you can't stop every single person --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- so ...
L:  -- and now, I mean, the schools are, you know, protecting so against somebody coming in una- unauthorized and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah, that's not good either for the young kids, you know.  Ah, I don't think, you know, because, I think it kind of scares 'em, you know, when the, ah, doors are locked after they get into school and, ah --
R:  Mhm.  But you know, I mean, if you go to a shopping mall, I mean, you just walk into the mall and you go ahead and you go shopping.  Now, if somebody wants to come in there and -- with a canister of something, and open the canister and let, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just let -- let it go, whatever it is --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know, you know --
L:  Well, it's, ah --
R:  -- what all the stuff is.
L:  That's the same way, like, you know, concerts or ball games, they could come in --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, with, ah, explosives strapped to them under their shirts or jackets and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- really do a lot of damage that, ah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, I mean, just walking around the mall somebody could open a canister of something and, kaboom, it'd get into the air and -- and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a whole bunch of people could get [inaudible].
L:  And it would be a lot of people that'd be gone.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  I mean, we still have the freedom to walk into a mall and not be searched and all that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- thank goodness.
L:  I think if it ever came to that it would be just too much.
R:  Yeah. [MN]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And your grocery stores and everywhere else.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there has to be a point at which we have to -- I guess we have to be trusting of, um --
L:  Ah, yeah, of, yeah [MN] the guy next door or that's walking alongside of us or whatever, I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's a [MN] --
R:  I don't want to live in fear.  I don't wanna be, um, [MN] um -- I don't wanna be, [MN] ah --
L:  Afraid to go and --
R:  No.  I -- a- and I also -- but I don't also want to have my head in the sand.  I mean, you know, I have to be --
L:  No.
R:  -- aware.  You know, my boss said [MN] at the beginning of the, ah, war with Iraq, you know, everybody here was stocking up, or a lot of people were stocking up on, um, staples and things like that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and he said, "Now, do you think anybody's going to come to little old Harper Woods", which is where we work, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- "and attack us?" and I said, "No".  But I said, "I think somebody could go in -- go and put something into the water system", so I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- made sure I have a lot of bottled water at home.
L:  Oh.
R:  You know.
L:  Well, that's the same way, like with the airport in Dubuque.  I mean, Dubuque is [MN] about, ah, sixty thousand people in the farming areas all around [MN] but, ah, I said, "Who's going to come to Dubuque and, ah, blow up the airport or do something, some damage --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- out at the airport", a little town, you know, a little place like this. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I know, I know.  And, y- you know, and you hope that that won't happen.  I mean, when we go to the Detroit airport it -- it's -- it makes you wonder.  I mean, their security --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is very tight and, um, I -- we were just teasing my mom, she's eighty two, and we were teasing her because, ah, when we flew last year, um, she and my husband and I were pulled over for the extra search, you know --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- where you have to take your shoes off and things and I was teasing her yesterday and I said, "Yeah, it was your fault, mom.  You had that -- that, you know, guilty look about you" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- "and I [MN] made -- made them pull us over", and she said, "Oh, they do it with every so many people".  And I said, "Oh, no, it was just your look --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- "about you, you know". [LAUGH]
L:  Well, that's, [MN] ah, I don't know where we were going to and that was in, ah, Chicago I think --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, ah, [MN] my son went through the detector, through the a- arch, like, ah, twice and then they, ah, ah, use, they had handheld mechanisms on him and it still was going off and he ha- had emptied his pockets and what have you and here he had a belt on with a buckle --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- that was causing it to go off. [MN]
R:  Yeah, my husband has set it off a couple of times with belt buckle --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and mom said she set it off w- with a piece of foil.  It was a foil wrapper from a gum wrapper.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  Yeah, and it just set the -- the alarm off for some reason.
L:  Huh.
R:  And it hasn't done it every time --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, um, you know, I guess maybe it was a more sensitive, ah, sensor or something that --
L:  Yeah, well, they may have more sensitive, you know, things now that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to go through and that but, ah, yeah.
R:  But I hope that they, you know, [MN] um ...
L:  Well, I think if they get everything settled there in the Middle East between, ah, Israel and Palestine --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [MN], ah, that, you know, the rest will kind of fall into place.
R:  Mhm.  Well, you know, I said to my boss, "There is always a looney tune in the world".  I mean --
L:  Yeah.  There's always some --
R:  -- there's one walking around everywhere, you know.
L:  Well, there's always some place that there's [MN] an uprising or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or something that --
R:  Or -- or just one individual who's just a little bit, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- off his rocker and not quite there, you know. [MN]
L:  Yeah, two bricks short of a full load.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, and, ah --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know, if they're gonna do something, they're gonna do something and --
L:  Yeah, nothing's gonna detour them from, ah, if they set their mind to it or that.
R:  That's right.  That's right.  
L:  But, ah -- 
R:  And, you know --
L:  -- yeah, I -- but I think --
R:  -- you just hope that that -- that, um, that doesn't start anything else, you know.
L:  Yeah.  Oh ...
R:  'Cause, like, you know when we -- when the Iraq war started that's what I told him.  I said, "It's not that there might -- you know, there might not be an organized, you know, effort to attack Detroit, but", [MN] I said, "you know, a bunch of loonies will get out there" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- "all on the fringes" -- you know, that --
L:  Well, and then it's like --
R:  --they all well --
L:  -- like some -- some people protest.  They don't give a darn what it is.  They're all set to protest about something.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  I mean, you'd think that they'd find something better to do with their time.  I mean, I sure could but [MN] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.  Ah, so, how long have you belonged to this here group?
R:  Oh, this is my first call.
L:  [MN] It's mine too.  I just joi- -- I mean, it said on the Internet, first of all, it was a couple of weeks now --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- and, ah, and, ah, everybody's been, you know, different ones have been joining it and that and I thought, "Oh, I will too" and see [MN], ah, because this one woman on the Internet said oh, "You really talk with some interesting people and get some different ideas and everything and --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, oh --
R:  How did you find out about it?
L:  On the Internet.
R:  Oh, yeah, me too.
L:  Yeah, yeah, in a chat room.  I, ah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- saw -- d- do you go to -- do you belong to RMC?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [MN] 
R:  That's where I saw it.
L:  Yeah, yeah. [MN]
R:  [MN]
L:  Yeah, I go every day or try to get there every day.
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  Ahah.
R:  I do too.
