R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Sarah.  How are you?
R:  Fine.  How are you?
L:  That's good.  Um, so, we're supposed to talk about how -- what the US can do to prevent a terrorist attack?
R:  Yeah, bio -- bio terrorist attacks.
L:  Yeah, so, what do you think the US can do?
R:  I think, um, [LIPSMACK] if, um, they get their act together in the White House, um, they will, um, [LIPSMACK] -- um, and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- kick out the bad seeds, they'll be able to, um -- um -- [LIPSMACK] um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] they'll be able to get rid of the terrorist, um, activity, just like that.
L:  [NOISE] I'm sorry?
R:  They'll be able to get rid of the terrorist activities.
L:  Yeah, if they straighten out their act.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Well, what I think is, they're -- they just need to not be so confrontational.  You know, like I think like, they're just trying to go to war with somebody, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, so, I think that if they were -- weren't so confronting -- so, it's like it was all about money because every war is about money and, [NOISE] um, [LIPSMACK] you know, they just need to make peace and love [LAUGH] and happiness, not war.
R:  [LIPSMACK] I see what you're saying.  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] and the other thing, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that when you take out all the, um -- the criminal -- the criminal -- the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- bad seeds --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in a good way, I mean, talking --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- what you said --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- then, um, we can all be --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- getting along peacefully.
L:  Right.  And also I don't think that it has anything to do with like security in the airports.  I think that is just really stupid because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when I was at the airport last time --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- uh, they let me board a plane that I wasn't supposed to be boarded on and it's really about the working staff there.  It's not about like the people consumers and everything like that, you know, that are trying to fly.  It's really about the people that work there because a person, totally let me get on the wrong plane and I didn't even mean to do that and they made me miss my flight in return, 'cause I should've been boarding a different plane, you know.  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think it has to do with like the people that work there and that's how, you know, they can prevent bioterr- terrorism in another way, is to like, you know, to really make sure the people are doing their jobs.  You know, because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- people didn't even check in my ticket or whatever, so [LIPSMACK] ...
R:  And then when you go on the, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the trains, it's, um -- it's like they don't -- they don't check things --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or something.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, pretty much anybody --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- can, er -- can come in the United States and get a social security card.  You know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- because I live with like a lot of people that come from --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Europe and it's like every- everybody -- oh, you know, it's really easy for them to fill out a social security card.  So, I think they need to have like, you know, like a background search or something like that, you know --
R:  Yeah, that makes --
L:  -- for that.
R:  -- sense.
L:  Because the terrorists can come and like reside here and they can just be like planning it all out, just like they were before, you know.
R:  Yeah and they can pose as one of us and then, um, we -- we can't do nothing about it until it's too late.
L:  Yeah. [LIPSMACK] Yeah but I mean, I really don't have anything to say on the topic [NOISE] because I really don't get involved with what the government does because I feel like [NOISE], eh, one voice is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- not gonna make a difference, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I'm not gonna like start, like a whole team of protests or whatever, you know and I really don't even get involved with it, um, like to tell you the truth.  You know, I don't even research the -- I don't even watch the news [NOISE], so [LIPSMACK] I can't even really speak on it that much [NOISE].  Oh, sorry. [NOISE]
R:  You know --
L:  Oh, wait, no that's [NOISE] -- [LIPSMACK] um, [NOISE] yeah, so [NOISE] that's just kind of crazy, 'cause you really can't do [NOISE] anything [NOISE] by yourself, you know.
R:  Yeah, you need --
L:  Like the U -- the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- US, maybe they -- they could do something about it but you, as a person, you can't really do anything about it.
R:  That's true.
L:  You probably[?] --
R:  You need more people to be behind you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in order --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because one person [LAUGH], him or her- --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- -self cannot do anything.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah [NOISE] and so like, I don't know if, um, the President [NOISE] -- do you like the President [NOISE] right now? [NOISE]
R:  No.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah [NOISE].  Yeah I think that Bill Clinton should've [NOISE] not [NOISE] turned himself over [NOISE], or like [NOISE] we shouldn't have like cared about his personal [NOISE] life. You know, well, it's his personal life [NOISE], you know [NOISE], so ...
R:  Yeah, every- --
L:  [NOISE] But, uh --
R:  -- -thing's seeming --
L:  'Cause I feel like if -- if Bill Clinton was in office, or you know, like none of this would've happened.  'Cause he -- I don't know.  Like he seemed like [NOISE] -- whatever [NOISE].  Oh, okay [NOISE].  Yeah, I just feel like, um, [LIPSMACK] it's just crazy that this stuff is happening right as soon as, um, [NOISE] George Bush junior, or whatever, comes into office. [NOISE]
R:  Then everything starts going down -- down the drain.
L:  Yeah, it is like all of a sudden [NOISE], when he comes to office, [NOISE] you know [NOISE], it's just crazy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Unbelievable.
L:  Yeah, it is [NOISE].  So, where do you live?
R:  [NOISE] Um, I live in Van Nuys.
L:  [NOISE] Van Nuys, okay.  I live in Venice.  What's your name?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Richard.
L:  [NOISE] Richard, nice to meet you. [NOISE]
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  [NOISE] So, at the end, when they come on -- 'cause this is like the second time I've done this, how do they know that I participated in it?  Do I put in like some kind of code or something at --
R:  Um --
L:  -- the end?
R:  -- I thi- --
L:  Or do I just --
R:  -- I --
L:  -- hang up?
R:  I think, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- well, did they tell you a code or something?
L:  Yeah, they did.
R:  Well, I think, um --
L:  [NOISE] 'Cause, uh, they never asked me to put it in anywhere last time, so I just kind of hung up. [NOISE]
R:  Oh.
L:  They told -- they told me to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to relay my --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- comments on the situation [NOISE], you know --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- and then [NOISE] -- and then I just hung up after that. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah I think you're supposed to put in your pin number or something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think that's how we end up getting paid or something.
L:  Yeah I know. [NOISE]
R:  Is this --
L:  So, I don't --
R:  -- your second --
L:  -- where to -- 
R:  -- one?
L:  Yeah this is my second time talking to someone.
R:  Huh.
L:  So, like I don't know [NOISE], like what you -- do you press your pin number with your phone, or do you just say your pin number? [NOISE]
R:  Uh, they didn't tell me.
L:  [NOISE] Oh [NOISE].  Yeah [NOISE], yeah, so, [NOISE] I don't know.  So, have you got paid for yours yet?
R:  No.  This is my first one.
L:  Oh, okay. [LIPSMACK] Yeah I haven't got --
R:  How --
L:  -- paid --
R:  -- long --
L:  -- for mine.
R:  -- how long ago was your first one?
L:  Like last week, maybe.
R:  Last -- oh, oh.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, so, I probably --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- shouldn't have -- I haven't got any mail yet at all actually, [NOISE] so [NOISE] -- [LIPSMACK] yeah but bio terrorism is crazy [NOISE].  You know, I would hate, [NOISE] you know, people like my kids [NOISE] in generations, I would hate to [NOISE] have them go through anything like that, you know.
R:  Yeah --
L:  Like --
R:  -- becau- --
L:  -- have you watched the movie -- the movie Outbreak?  Like, if --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- something like that would happen --
R:  Where the monkeys starts- --
L:  Yeah, that would --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- be crazy. [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, having a -- a monkey spreading a disease and oh, my God.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then you --
L:  Like with --
R:  -- have --
L:  -- anthrax.  Anthrax spreads like that, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] oh, man.  Oh, boy.
L:  Yeah.  So, I think anthrax is kind of like a airborne disease in Outbreak.  It is like a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- airborne thing too, so ... [LIPSMACK]
R:  And it could always start back up and --
L:  Yeah and definitely, I think the US should know about it, like be knowledgeable about it, so they can know how to fight it off.  You know, like if there was some kind of disease that would spread throughout the United States, like anthrax or whatever --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they -- they need to have an antidote, you know, anthrax antidote, or whatever, so they can, you know, cure people, so it doesn't just kill everybody.
R:  Exactly.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Exactly.  
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  So, that's what I feel. [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] Oh and do you think, um, [LIPSMACK] that, um [LIPSMACK] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, [LIPSMACK] Saddam's dead and ...
L:  Oh, that.  I don't know.  It's kind of weird because I was watching TV and they showed him and he didn't look the same [NOISE], or something, like he had --
R:  And then they said he has a whole --
L:  -- a mustache --
R:  -- bunch --
L:  -- so ...
R:  -- of different, um, people. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that compose as him and that look like --
R:  That's scary.
L:  -- that look like him.  Yeah.  That was probably one of his look alike -- I don't think that he's dead but he probably -- he was hurt -- he was hurt in some kind of way. [NOISE]
R:  Toy.  That's scary.
L:  Yeah but I used to live in Saudi Arabia. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  How was it?
L:  [NOISE] Um, it was a long time ago.  It was hot, it was desert. [NOISE]
R:  Wow.
L:  Mhm.
R:  How's it over where you're -- where you are now?
L:  [NOISE]
