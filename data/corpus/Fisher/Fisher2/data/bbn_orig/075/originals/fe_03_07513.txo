R:  Hi.  I'm Barra[?].
L:  Hello.  This is Heath.
R:  Heath?
L:  Yeah.  Like, ah, Heathcliff without the cliff.
R:  Got it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm Barra, like Barracuda.
L:  M- -- oh, Barra -- I thought it -- actually thought it was Vera with a V.
R:  No.  No.  No.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, at any rate, I'm in California.  I guess they want us to talked about -- talk about bioterrorism.
R:  And of what we can do to prevent it.
L:  Right.
R:  Um --
L:  Well, what would you think?  I would think that distributing knowledge would probably be the best thing.  'Cause, ah, I don't know -- I don't know if you've heard about the West Nile, ah, virus that was going around by mosquitoes?
R:  Right.
L:  And, ah --
R:  Do you think that was +bioterror- -- terrorist?
L:  No.  No.  No.  No.  But --
R:  Just as an example?
L:  Right -- as an example.  I mean, when they show it on television and stuff they show, like, thirty second blurbs and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, they don't really give you a lotta information.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  'Cause I guess it's not a, ah -- a big viewer puller, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, ah -- I don't know.  I think, ah -- I think more information would be good.
R:  Mhm. [LIPSMACK] Yeah.  I don't know.  Um, [PAUSE] I think information is great but I mean, how do you prevent bioterrorism?  Bioterrorism, like, by, like, some terrorist organizations spreading that through biological means --
L:  Well I --
R:  -- so that they --
L:  I don't think you can stop it from starting.
R:  Okay.
L:  Because --
R:  But you could --
L:  I -- I think that's practically impossible.  But I think that if you had something like, ah -- if you've heard about, like, the Amber alert for, ah, kidnapping?
R:  Yes.
L:  Um, something similar like that that if they know that there is a --
R:  So, kinda, like when there's a breakout of, like, um, mosquito -- what's that disease with the mosquitoes? Starts with E ...?
L:  That was the West Nile with the mosquitoes.
R:  No.  No.  No.  It starts with an E -- there's another one.
L:  Okay.
R:  It's, like, happens once every five years.  So, just by saying, "Hey, this is going on --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- hang out in your house".
L:  You know, and -- I don't know.  Maybe in --
R:  I guess with the anthrax, you know, they were -- people were much more cautious.
L:  Right.  And then if -- like, if I knew in my house that, okay, there's a high risk of, you know, anthrax or a high risk of this --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, that and it's a level of two outta five, you know, I would take appropriate cautions.  I might not travel as much, I might not, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- go into public places as much, you know, things like that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know what I mean?  And that -- I think that would protect the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- spreading of any type of biological disease.  You know?
R:  Okay.
L:  And then, ah --
R:  I can see how that would help.  I --
L:  And then, you know, like, in hospitals and, ah --
R:  Just quarantine rooms and so on and so forth.
L:  Well, you know, in hospitals and stuff like that, they're just gonna have -- they would have to know immediately --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and take some type of precautions because, you know, those are -- or even the bus system.  Y- you know?  Places where people meet and could spread the disease.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They could, ah, possibly provide some type of, ah, you know, preventive medicine, let's say, for, like, medicating the staff at the hospitals and maybe masks when you get on the bus or, you know, something like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  But, ah -- I don't know.  I -- I tend they -- they tend to lean towards the highly conservative side because they're concerned about panic.  Ah --
R:  In terms of, like, media?
L:  Yeah.  Media.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know?  I think, [PAUSE] um --
R:  No.  I totally agree.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And if you think about it -- look what happened, like, with the anthrax.  There were so many people on antibiotics that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- didn't need them and there's a lot of repercussions from that.
L:  Yup.
R:  You know?  Like tolerances.
L:  Yeah.  We're -- well, the- -- they put it in our food now -- antibiotics.
R:  M- --
L:  The -- like, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if you eat beef or any type of meat, chicken --
R:  Well, they don't put it in the food.  What happens is --
L:  No, not directly.
R:  -- the --
L:  It's in the feed that the --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- animals eat.
R:  And that's not for humans.  That's because they don't -- they don't wanna risk disease amongst [NOISE] the, ah, cows.
L:  Well, I think animal husbandry could be improved by a lot.  They're -- they basically trying to get the pound per chicken really cheap.
R:  Do -- oh --
L:  You know?
R:  I -- I'm a vegetarian.  I don't eat that because I don't believe in the system.
L:  Well, I eat meat but I do try and --
R:  Like free range?
L:  -- not eat fast food.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, because I think they buy that shit by the ton.
R:  Well, do you buy, like, free range stuff and ...?
L:  N- not -- I don't quite go that far but I shop at, like, Trader Joe's.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, which --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think that, ah, they're onto something [LAUGH] there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  It's smaller farmers --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that, ah, produce better quality food.
R:  Right.
L:  And I -- you know, I think that's far, far better.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  I agree.
L:  And like, if -- I don't know.  If you look at, like, back in the post World War Two where in Europe they were the -- doing the victory gardens --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because they had such a bad economy.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  You know, I mean, nobody has really a garden where they would, like, grow their own zucchinis or, you know, stuff to eat.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, vegetables and fruits and stuff like that.  Nobody really does that any more.
R:  Well, I live in a small community and people, you know, have --
L:  Do do that?
R:  There's a lot of, like ...  Well, I live in a community -- I live in Gainesville, Florida.  Which --
L:  Oh, I've actually been there.  I used -- I was in the Navy for four years --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- in, ah, Mayport, Florida --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I had some friends that lived in --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Gainesville.  Actually, I don't know exactly where -- I don't think it was Gainesville but it was in that county.
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  And, ah, it's nice.
R:  Yeah.  And, you know, there's a lot of farmers.  We have farmer's market every week.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so, the -- and I have people who grow their own home gardens who do grow cale and tomatoes and ...
L:  Okay.
R:  So, I think that some people do [NOISE] -- definitely not in, like, big cities.
L:  Right.
R:  But --
L:  Yeah.  I'm in Los Angeles so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, nobody does it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Are you -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  But I mean, I think that would just be better but I don't -- I mean, we're a corporate --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- state.
R:  Right.
L:  And --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I think the big guys don't promote any of that.  I mean, all the little farmers are getting eaten up by the big corporations or conglomerates or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- whatever you wanna call them.  You know?  And I don't think that is -- it's good for the big people but I don't think it's really good for the general nation as a whole, myself.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  I don't think so either.
L:  Yup.  But, ah --
R:  But --
L:  I don't know.  I -- I don't think there's a lot you can do to really prevent bioterrorism.
R:  Mhm.
L:  If it happens, it's, ah -- it's gonna happen and it's gonna be a matter of controlling it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, control the bleeding type a thing.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  More so than preventing it from happening.
R:  [LIPSMACK] I guess -- yeah.  I guess if you ask George Bush, he's gonna say, "Kill Saddam".
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know what I mean?  It just depends on who you speak to.
L:  Well, that administration had come in with the idea they were going to out Saddam anyway.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So --
R:  Is he actually dead?
L:  -- the fact they're trying to attach that to nine eleven --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- is, quick frankly, to -- in my opinion, not, ah, true.
R:  Right.  I agree.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is he dead?
L:  Um, I don't know.  They never know really.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, they haven't -- they aren't willing to say that he is. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  He's definitely out of power, which I think is a good thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Is --
R:  Who's in power now?
L:  Um, they're -- they don't know really.  They're bringing in this one guy who was royalty and was living in the United States and, ah -- I don't know.  I saw something on CNN and he was walking around with a bunch of bodyguards and stuff --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I guess he was of the royal blood.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And he left, like, twenty five, thirty years ago or something.
R:  Hm.
L:  And now, since he has an association with the royalty blood, they're bringing him back in, they're gonna try and put him in power.  I highly suspect that he has connections with Washington and the --
R:  Of course he does if he's been living --
L:  You know, it'd be, kinda, like Saudi Arabia where we control, or have influence on, the power there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And the power doesn't have a very good connection with the people.  You know?  I don't know.
R:  Yeah. [PAUSE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  It's all, kinda -- I don't know.  And I don't like the religious intonations that they're starting to talk about too.
R:  Of our country? [NOISE]
L:  Um, yeah.  Like, George Bush is obviously a --
R:  I know.  It's ridiculous.
L:  -- Protestant and we are trying to deal with Middle Eastern, ah --
R:  No.  It's absolutely ridiculous.  There's no such thing[?] as n- -- church and state.  There's totally a relationship between church and state that shouldn't be there.
L:  Yes.
R:  And it is and it's --
L:  Yup.
R:  -- ridiculous.
L:  Yup.  And they're even trying to get the very highly conservative judges now, um, in so that, ah, peop- -- they're -- I mean --
R:  I know.  It's gonna be a [inaudible] --
L:  Ten years from now they could overturn Roe versus Wade.  They could --
R:  No doubt.
L:  It --
R:  No doubt.
L:  It -- it -- it -- [SIGH]
R:  Without a doubt.  And Naroe[?] is working against that, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Plus --
L:  And I'm a little guy.  You know, I'm, like, you know, low brow, like -- homebody and, ah, there's more of us -- I -- I mean, myself -- my type of people -- than there are of these high brow, ah, conservative right wing -- neo right wing --
R:  No.  I agree.
L:  -- politicians.
R:  Honestly.  I'm definitely, like, a left wing.
L:  Yeah. [LIPSMACK]
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it's scary. [LIPSMACK]
L:  Yeah.  I think George Bush is gonna get another [LAUGH] -- another, ah --
R:  Oh, he won the war.  Of course he's gonna get re-elected.
L:  Yup.  Yup.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yup.  So, that'll be interesting.
R:  If interesting means disastrous, I agree.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, there's nothing much you can really -- I think that we can really do about it and the -- I think the big push would be to, ah, attempt --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to get somebody good in office, ah, two thou- --
