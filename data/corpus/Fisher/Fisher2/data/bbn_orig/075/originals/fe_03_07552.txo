L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, my name's Linda.
R:  Hi, Linda.  My name's April.
L:  Hi, April.
R:  So how are you doing?
L:  Just fine.  Have you done this before?
R:  No.  First time.
L:  Me neither.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Me neither.  Just --
R:  Where are you from?
L:  I'm in San Diego. 
R:  Oh, I'm in Florida.
L:  Florida?  Wow.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Coast to coast here, huh?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Are we supposed to be talking about bioterrorism?
L:  Yeah, that's what we're supposed to be talking about, mm.  How -- how -- how do we think the US could prevent it?  I don't know.  [LAUGH].
R:  That's a tough one.  I don't think there's any really way to prevent it.
L:  Yeah, well, they can take all the steps, you know, and guard all the mails and all the planes and everything, but I don't think they can do -- I'd only go --
R:  Yeah, 'cause you don't know what they're any -- any countries are doing in the backwoods.  
L:   No.  And Unfortunately --
R:   And how can you control it unless you're there and there's no way to control it.
L:   Yeah.  That's like those people who lau- who launch viruses on the internet and stuff.  You can't control them either.
R:   That's true.  
L:   Yeah.  Well, that's the same sort of thing.  But, you know, I don't know.  [LAUGH].
R:   Supposed to talk for ten minutes about it?
L:   Yeah.  
R:   [LAUGH].
L:   Yeah.  [LAUGH].  
R:   Mm.
L:   I know, huh?  [LAUGH].  Well, different, so -- I don't know.  I guess they just have to -- you know, take precautions against it and if and when it does happen, then they need to figure out where it came from and retaliate back hard.  
R:   Yeah.
L:   Which, you know, the rest of the world doesn't want them doing that, but --
R:   I reckon, too, if they restrict the re- restrictions to people coming into the country.
L:   Yeah.  I agree.  
R:   Like, they're doing, um, terminal checks now, but from what I hear, they're only checking, like, one in ten bags and it's not -- it's not everybody.  They're doing it at random.  
L:   Well, I don't -- I see here --
R:   The foreigners coming in and --
L:   -- being here, so close to the border and the -- the drug busts they make.
R:   Yeah.  
L:   And the ones that they catch.  Well, whatever happens to all these other ones that get through that they don't catch?
R:   Mm.
L:   You know, and they're talking about drugs, so what about all the other stuff coming in?
R:   Yeah, they can train dogs that sniff, um, cocaine and stuff.  Why not to be able to sniff chemical agents and stuff like that?
L:   Well, they have some of them -- some of the airport dogs and stuff do that.  
R:   Mm.
L:   They sniff for bombs and things like that.  Some of the agents, but just -- you know, unfortunately our world's changed and we all have to live -- live safer, I guess it is.  And we're -- you know, more scared of -- of your neighbor. 
R:   Yeah.  
L:   So --
R:   Yeah, very true.  
L:   Yeah, that's -- you know, the only thing this world's ever had continuous of was war, one way or the other.  People fighting over one thing or another.  But, yeah, there's these, you know, chemical weapons and stuff are very scary because they take out mass people, innocent people.  They don't care.  You know, makes the world a very scary place.  
R:   So very true.
L:   So, where at in Florida are you?
R:   Um, well, we just moved here from North Carolina actually.  Um, and we're right outside of Tampa in a little town called Brandon.
L:   Oh, okay.  
R:   And you're in San Francisco, you said?
L:   No, it's San Diego. 
R:   Oh, San Diego?
L:   Mhm.
R:   That's down south --
L:   Actually, a little town called National City, but it's a suburb of San Diego.  
R:   Oh, okay.
L:   About eight miles from the border.
R:   Okay, yeah.  I've been there. 
L:   You've been there?
R:   One of my bro- yeah, when my brothers were coming back from the war, they actually --
L:   Mhm?
R:   -- their ships docked there. 
L:   Oh.  Okay.  
R:   And so we came to get them.
L:   At Thirty Second Street, mhm.  
R:   It's so many years back.  I was just a little girl then.
L:   [LAUGH].
R:   [LAUGH].  It doesn't even seem like that, huh?
L:   No.  Time flies.
R:   [LAUGH].  Yeah, but I bet you we've only been talking five minutes.
L:   [LAUGH].
R:   [LAUGH].
L:   I know.  I know.  I know.
R:   You got kids?
L:   I have one daughter.  She thirteen.
R:   Oh.  
L:   Just finishing up seventh grade.  This is her last week of school.  [LAUGH].
R:   I don't know --
L:   And you?
R:   Mine are already out.  I've got two boys, fifteen and eleven.
L:   Oh.  Fun.
R:   They've been out almost two weeks now.  They're about to drive me crazy already.
L:   Oh, [LAUGH].
R:   Been looking for a summer camp for stuff for them the other day.  
L:   Do you have trouble explaining what goes on with the terrorism, different things going on, to your kids?
R:   No, I really don't have any trouble about that.  Everything that goes on, they, um, watch on TV and school like in current events and stuff like that, but they come home and they tell me more about it than what I already knew.
L:   [LAUGH].  Well, that's good.
R:   Yeah.
L:   At least that they -- they're looking -- you know, they're looking at it from a -- you know, a talking point of view, they're not bottling it inside and stuff.
R:   Yeah.
L:   I know my daughter's been scared a few times, but you know, she's pretty much handling it.  
R:   Yeah.
L:   So, you know?
R:   A lot of people are afraid to fly, but good grief, you know, you can't stop life because of what happened.
L:   Yeah.  No.  We've flown.  She's -- in fact, she's going to fly out of here soon and go up to Washington to see her dad, so [LAUGH] she's flown many times since -- since November -- oh, September eleventh, so -- but yeah.
R:   I don't know what you can do about biochemicals.  If it's not going to be that, it'll be something else.  
L:   Yeah.  This is true.  They're gonna come up with something, and while they're working on -- yeah, it'll be an every day thing, as you won't even rea- realize it, or -- or something --
R:   Yeah.
L:   -- be -- you know, odorless and tasteless and invisible or something.  Mhm.  They're gonna try.  
R:   Yeah.
L:   Frighten --
R:   I think sometimes they see things in movies, too, that are -- that are, like, fictitious and they make it basically come true.
L:   Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, oh -- yeah.  Life imitating the arts, definitely.
R:   Exactly.  
L:   Yeah.  And you think of sometimes that they -- they give them the ideas.  
R:   Exactly. 
L:   [LAUGH].  We always thought --
R:   Kinda of like -- like what I was --
L:   We thought --
R:   -- saying, it's like a serial killer.  They might never be a serial killer, but then they read a book on how to kill people and serial killing, and the next thing you know [LAUGH] kinda the same thing, you know?
L:   Yeah.  
R:   You hear about it, even though it may not have never happened.
L:   Yeah.  That's true.
R:   Can be a copy cat type thing.
L:   Copy cat thing.  They have a real bad problem here with the kids out doing street racing.
R:   Yeah.
L:   Drag racing, and we've had people killed.  But, so what do they come out with?  New movies that show it all over the place.
R:   Exactly.  
L:   [LAUGH].  You know?
R:   Exactly.
L:   And it just makes it more of a thing.
R:   Mhm. 
L:   So -- mhm.
R:   I don't know, when I was a kid, I had no fear.  So being in a kid's shoes, it's different.
L:   Yeah.
R:   Once -- I guess you're not really necessarily grown, but once you're older and you have kids, everything changes.
L:   Yeah.  'Cause you're looking at things differently.  
R:   Yeah.  
L:   Yeah.
R:   I certainly wouldn't do half the stuff I did when I was a kid.  [LAUGH].  Snakes, and I mean, thinking about snakes and just -- I don't know --
L:   [LAUGH].
R:   -- sharks in the ocean.
L:   Yeah.
R:   I'd barrel out into the ocean and I didn't think about it.  
L:   Mhm.
R:   Now my kids are out there swimming and I'm worried, shark bite.  [LAUGH].
L:   This is true.  
R:   Yeah. 
L:   I can make my daughter laugh at me.  I can remember playing on the beach, playing in the water and stuff, you know, two, three months after we saw the movie Jaws, and all of a sudden, we saw fins in the water, and there were six or seven of us and we all shark -- yelled, "Shark" and pulled out of the water, and then we got up to the shore and watched a school of dolphins swim by.  [LAUGH].
R:   Oh.  Oh, my goodness. 
L:   You know, of course she watches the --
R:   Well, still -- 
L:   -- movie now and she goes, "How could you guys have been afraid of that?  It's so fake?"
R:   [LAUGH].  
L:   It wasn't then.  It was real.  [LAUGH].
R:   No.  [LAUGH].
L:   It was very real.
R:   It's so amazing what they do with film today. 
L:   Mhm. Yeah.  That's why I don't go to any of these horror movies any more these days.  They're just too real.
R:   Oh, I can't deal with them.
L:   Mhm.  
R:   I never really could.  I -- I don't like a horror flick at all. And there's another thing.  It just puts ideas into sick minds.  
L:   This is true.  This is true.  So, I don't know.  I -- but I don't know how the United States, you know, back to our topic here, is gonna stop it.
R:   Well, I guess maybe one way [MN] another way to help it, then, is to kinda maybe stay out of other countries' business a little bit.  [LAUGH].  Maybe they'll just leave us alone.  I know, it's about alliance and helping your neighbor, but --
L:   Yeah.
R:   -- sometimes the nose gets poked in places it does not belong. 
L:   This is true.  Yeah.  So perhaps it might be better to let them just deal with it in themselves.
R:   Best idea yet, oh, vote in a female president.
L:   There you go.
R:   [LAUGH].  
L:   Mm, I don't know.
R:   She'll take care of everything, huh?
L:   [LAUGH].
R:   You know --
L:   I don't know.  I think if they did that, she'd have to be so -- that -- to be able to win, she'd have to be so conservative, and then they'd question every little thing she did anyway.  
R:   Yeah.  It's that way -- anyone that comes in is that way.
L:   Mhm. 
R:   They're all good until they make a wrong move.
L:   Yeah.  This is true.  
R:   You know, even if they support a move that's made, and then it's wrong, then it's an anti support --
L:   [LAUGH].
R:   You know?  For one minute and against the next.  
L:   You can't win one way or the other.  No.  So.  
R:   Well, I don't know.  Maybe we should --
