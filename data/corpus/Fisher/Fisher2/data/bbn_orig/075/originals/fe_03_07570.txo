L:  Hi, my name's Larry Colwell.
R:  Hi, Larry.  My name's Rebecca and I imagine you're a big sports fan?
L:  No, I'm not. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I'm not either.  I don't even watch professional sports --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on TV.
L:  Hm.  I watch a little bit.  I just figured if they had a two dollar and a four dollar window or something, it'd be a lot better, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  Boy --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- uh, what do you watch?
L:  I like baseball.
R:  Do you?
L:  Yeah, then I like car races too.  I mean, it's not really a sport, I don't know.  I don't guess but --
R:  Yeah, I like car races too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Did you watch the, um, [LIPSMACK] Indianapolis five hundred?
L:  No, missed it.  Got bits --
R:  Well, I --
L:  -- and --
R:  -- don't even --
L:  -- pieces.
R:  -- know if that was t- -- that isn't televised, is it?
L:  Uh, I don't know if it is or not.  I know that -- that, I walked in -- I've got a friend, she's a sports nut and I walked in and caught races on a different time but I never caught what the races were.
R:  My friend is a sports nut too.  Shall we go call them and let them take the --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- call [LAUGH]
L:  -- we'll let them take the poll.  How 'bout that? [LAUGH]
R:  I like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- to watch the Olympics.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, the --
R:  I watched it --
L:  -- Olympics is all right, yeah.
R:  I watched those, uh -- the winter Olympics and the summer Olympics but -- and then I do watch, um, [LIPSMACK] just main, um, [LIPSMACK] sporting, like the super bowl --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, things like --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- that where --
L:  -- I watched it through -- you know, up to the super bowl, I watched, you know.
R:  Were you sort of like you have to sit there and have a snack and watch it?
L:  Yeah, that makes it pretty nice.
R:  How 'bout --
L:  Do you ever --
R:  -- golf?
L:  Yeah, I like golf too.  I mean, my dad was trained by, uh, James Garner brother. 
R:  [NOISE] Really?
L:  And he was an a- -- yeah, he was an amateur golfer for a while.
R:  Wow.
L:  But, uh, um, I -- I like, uh, baseball, football, basketball.  I like them but it's just I'm not fascinated by them.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.  I feel like if they -- if th- -- er, it would make me more interested -- I like to gamble a little bit and if they had a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a window where you could bet at, well then I would be there more often watching the game --
R:  Oh, well --
L:  -- I mean --
R:  -- that's --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- a -- that's a good, uh, question.  Did you just watch the, um, [LIPSMACK] Sunnyside Race?
L:  Uh, no I didn't.
R:  Well, Sunnyside didn't win but --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- um, yeah, I like to watch horse racing too.  We just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- watched it last Saturday.
L:  Oh, is that right?
R:  But, um, [LIPSMACK] uh, I was gonna ask you -- oh, well, we have -- I watch golf quite a bit, Tiger --
L:  Right.
R:  -- Woods.
L:  Yeah, Tiger Woods, yeah.  So, who was the lady that got in, on the act?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you -- you know who I'm talking about?
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah, I can't think of her name right now.
R:  I can't either.  All I can think of is --
L:  But --
R:  -- Annika Sorenson, who's just playing golf here at the LPTA --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but it wasn't her.  But, um, [LIPSMACK] yeah, I -- actually [SIGH] --
L:  What about bowling?  Uh, I like bowling --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's pretty, you know --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a good thing to watch.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  A good [LAUGH] thing to watch. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I watch it --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- um, [NOISE] uh, once in a while too.  It's just actually, you know, just whatever I turn on as far as sports --
L:  Yeah, uh --
R:  -- goes, if someone else here is watching it.
L:  Yeah, that's the way it is -- it's like at my house I don't even really turn the TV on.  You know, I mean, I go to everybody else's house and they got it on and just watching it.
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know what I mean?
R:  That's exact- --
L:  Yeah but --
R:  -- -ly.
L:  I like the crowds.  You know what I mean?  At the house, er, if it -- it's just I live alone, so, you know what I mean?  It's -- it -- with the crowds on professional sports is incredible.  Even college but I mean, uh, on the professional sports, the crowds are so large.  You know, it just sort of brightens up the house a little bit, you know.
R:  Yeah, you're right.  It's, um [LIPSMACK] -- well, we -- I -- like I said, I watch the -- the basketball, the sixty four -- what is it?  Um --
L:  [LIPSMACK] I have no idea. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, it's the sixty four teams that start out.  Big sixteen or --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- sweet sixteen, that's what it is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I watch, um [LIPSMACK] -- watch that down to the main four, simply because, um, you know, people here are visiting here will -- will turn it on but, um, [LIPSMACK] let's see what else that we just watched.  Um, [LIPSMACK] do you watch bowling, like regularly, or ...
L:  [LIPSMACK] Just when -- when I know it's on.  I mean, you know, pretty regular if I know that it's on, you know but, uh -- uh -- uh, er --
R:  Well --
L:  -- as far as the bowlers, I can't remember their names or anything 'cause it's been a while since I've watched.  You know, 'cause I like --
R:  I don't have --
L:  -- to bowl myself.
R:  [LAUGH] I don't have, um, [LIPSMACK] cable, believe --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it or not.
L:  I don't either.
R:  So, um, you know [LAUGH] -- you know, um, it's -- there's just limited programs.
L:  Right.  Yeah, you just have a few channels and after that there's nothing.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And mostly on the weekends do sports or play movies.
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know, movies you've seen fifteen, sixteen times but --
R:  NBA -- I know basketball has been -- eh, we get that here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, [LIPSMACK] yeah this -- this is not my best topic because, you know, like it --
L:  Yeah, it's not mine either because it's just -- you know, I mean, I was friends with all of -- when I was going to college I was friends with all the basketball players and I was friends with all the baseball players but it's just, you know -- eh, they went professional.  A lot of them did go professional and I followed it a little bit but it's just, you know, the penalties and the different things, I just get lost on.
R:  Well, we follow --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, [LIPSMACK] big ten basketball a lot because, O- Ohio -- we're in Ohio and Ohio State --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just won the championship, of course.  Did you see that game?
L:  No, I sure didn't.
R:  Boy, that was good.  It was at the, um [LIPSMACK] -- uh, was it the Tostitos Bowl, I think, in Phoenix, Arizona.  But we watched that because we're all big Ohio State fans.
L:  Right.
R:  But, um, [LIPSMACK] that's probably the only -- only team I really follow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think everybody does that, you know, you have a certain State team that you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- follow.
L:  See, I went to OU, so OU was mine on college so --
R:  Oh, did you?  Really?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I didn't graduate from OU but, uh, I should have.  But I'm gonna go back but uh -- uh, yeah, OU's in, uh [SIGH] -- I l- -- uh -- uh, this is awful.  I like OU and OU's my home.  I like Texas too, you know [LAUGH].  So, whenever they get into their arguments and -- and everything, I'm for OU but you know, it's just if Texas win, I just shake it off, you know.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] yeah, well, does O -- Ohio U have, uh, what, basketball, football?  Yeah, I guess, they do.
L:  Oh, no, I'm talking about in Oklahoma.  
R:  Oh --
L:  Uh, U- --
R:  -- okay.
L:  -- University of Oklahoma.
R:  See, we're -- we're Ohio here, so I was thinking about --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Ohio University sports.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, er, no, I'm in Oklahoma and it's just -- University of Oklahoma's where I went an- and I was friends with the, uh -- well, uh, a few people.
R:  You must, um -- you must follow Texas sports a lot then, don't you?
L:  No, I don't get to because I don't have cable.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, that's true, you --
L:  The only --
R:  -- said that.
L:  -- the only thing that comes up is when they have the -- the UO Texas game.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Okay.
L:  And I mean and I'm not for Texas in any manner but you know and this is not professional, so we're probably gonna get in trouble. [LAUGH]
R:  Ah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You know --
R:  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  -- somehow or other -- somehow or other we drifted from professional crowds of football and basketball to college --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- athletics, you know.
R:  Oh, you know, you're right too.  I'm thinking college and it's supposed to be professional.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, I think --
L:  I mean --
R:  -- they'll forgive us for that.
L:  Yeah, see my favorite of all sports and, uh, as far as knowing about it, I really don't know that much about it but I just love to watch Australian football.
R:  Really?
L:  Yes, I love it because it's --
R:  Now -- now, tell me, how you get professional Australian football on with no cable?  Where do you watch --
L:  Well, I've had cable, you --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- know.  You know, I mean, it's just -- it's been in the past, you know.  But I mean, it -- it's -- it's really worthwhile to watch because --
R:  Well then, who do they -- who do they compete against?
L:  Well, I don't know.  I have -- all I --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- know is there's two teams and they go at it.  And I mean, it's a physical sport, believe me.  It's just -- you know, we have linebackers and -- and -- and -- and linemen and everything like that at the football game.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, they do too but they play without pads.  They -- you know, I mean --
R:  Really?
L:  -- yeah.  I mean, they're -- they're out there for blood [LAUGH]. You know what I mean?  They just -- they just go for it.
R:  Well, when you watch the, um -- [LIPSMACK] when you watch them, who -- what other team do they compete against then?  Do you remember?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, I have no idea.
R:  I --
L:  It's been so long since I've seen it.
R:  Hm.
L:  You know.
R:  I, uh -- yeah, I didn't realize that -- that they even had a different type of football.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Soccer's pretty good too.  I used to play soccer, er, when I was in grade school and, uh, I like soccer as far as professionalism, duh, 'cause it's -- it's -- you know, it's a different kind of game you know.  You can even use your head in it if you want to, you know.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I still -- I guess, for professional [LIPSMACK], car racing would be my choice.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, mine's Australian football though.
R:  Well, see, where -- in this part of the country, um, there is, um, stockcar racing and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- uh, professional car racing is --
L:  Well, Dayton, right?
R:  Yes --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yes, exactly.
L:  See, my cousin's from Dayton.
R:  Exactly.  Dayton --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, um -- [LIPSMACK] well, I asked you about the Indianapolis five hundred and of course that's not too far in Indianapolis.  That's every, uh, Memorial Day.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Right, right.
R:  But then too, it's dangerous.
L:  Yeah. [LIPSMACK] It is but when you see the speed that they go and if something happens, I guess you have no choice, you know.
R:  Have you ever been to a professional car race?
L:  I never in my life.
R:  It's, uh -- we were there once and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it is just -- just a big thrill.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean, the minute they shoot the gun to start, they're gone.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, yeah and loud I imagine.
R:  Yeah, really.  But that's [SIGH] -- it's risky.  There's s- -- there are many, um, car race tracks --
L:  Right, I'm into --
R:  -- around here.
L:  -- stockcar, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- not professional stockcar but I mean, stockcar races.
R:  You keep --
L:  And --
R:  -- throwing the word prof- [LAUGH] --
L:  Huh?
R:  -- professional, in because I keep getting away from --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, I do too.  I will too.  I'll be talking about everything else, you know.
R:  Exactly.  I think that's why they have to keep this on line because you know, it's so easy to -- to get off the track.
L:  Right, yeah, it is, you know.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] but again, getting back -- well, I don't even know.  I guess, the Olym- -- I said I liked to watch Olympics but --
