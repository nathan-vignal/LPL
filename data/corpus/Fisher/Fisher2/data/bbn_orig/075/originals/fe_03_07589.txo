R:  Hi, um, my name is Azeem.  I'm in, uh --
L:  [MN] What is your name, Atheen?
R:  Azeem.
L:  Oh, Azeem, hi.
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  Good, how are you?
R:  I'm doing all right.
L:  Good.  My name is Holly.
R:  Holly, nice to meet you.
L:  Yeah, hi.
R:  Um, so, this spor- -- the topic is sports on TV, am I right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, [LAUGH] and that's kinda funny, 'cause I -- I'm not -- I'm not that much of a sports fan, um, in terms of watching TV.  But, uh, I guess every once in a while I do -- I do watch, uh, certain events like if -- if they're big enough.  Like the +super -- Super Bowl or --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- or events such as that, yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  How about yourself?
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I'm not a big sports fan either, especially of watching it on TV.
R:  [MN] 
L:  But I'll watch basketball.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Especially during the playoffs.
R:  Yeah, during the playoffs, that -- that's quite a [inaudible] --
L:  And especially -- I tended -- I just moved to Los Angeles so, I -- I used to live in New York in one -- I lived there, I was a -- you know, I was very big Knicks fan.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, I didn't have cable TV but if the Knicks were on regular TV and -- and I was around, I would watch it and it would be pretty interesting.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I actually used to watch cricket as well a while back, uh --
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  -- that's -- it's -- it's mostly, like, international sports 'cause I -- I lived in, uh, East Africa in Kenya, like, most of my life.
L:  Mhm.  Uh-huh. 
R:  So, there's a huge, uh, British influence there so there'd be sports like cricket and, uh -- uh, field hockey, um, [PAUSE] what other sports are very British?
L:  Is field hockey, soccer?
R:  Ah, no.  Field hockey, it's -- it's like, um, think about hockey but without the ice.
L:  Oh, running with the stick, okay.
R:  Yes, exactly.  And, ah, I -- I guess you see -- you see that very little in the US and it's mostly a female sport but, ah, I think outside of the US it's -- it's quite a universal sport --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, ah, pretty big, 'specially in the -- in the East -- in the Far East and Asia I guess.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  [several inaudible words] 
L:  So, interesting.  Cricket, what is that exactly?
R:  Ah, cricket?  Um, let's see; how can I compare it to something?  Ah, [PAUSE] kind of -- I -- I can't really compare it to baseball.  Basically there's a -- a -- f- -- um, a bowler who's the same thing as a -- as a pitcher in baseball.  He'll just throw the ball at a batter.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, the bat, it isn't like -- it isn't the round kind of bat, it's more like a stretched square, like a rectangular bat.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, the ball is really, really hard.  And it's a -- it's a really hard wooden, uh, bat basically --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- sock th- -- sock the ball as hard as you can, um, and th- -- it's not a -- it's not a round pitch, it's just a straight pitch of -- there -- there are two batters -- there's, like, one on each side of this, ah, of the pitch basically.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they have to run across to the other side.  And, ah --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- either of them can basically be run out by if -- if the ball gets back and -- and they hit, um, these things called stumps, which are three, ah -- they're like three sticks on either end, and you --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- basically have to knock them down if -- if the other person's not in the -- into allowed area -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- to get them out.
L:  Huh.  And the ball is pitched in the air?  It's not on the ground?  
R:  Um, it's -- it's pretty much on the -- it's pretty much on the ground.  Um, it --
L:  Oh, it is. Uh-huh.
R:  -- it's supposed to -- I think on -- typically it bounces once; you're not allowed to bounce it more than once obviously.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, you either bounce it once or you don't bounce it at all.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, but most people tend to bounce it and then they put a bit of a spin in the ball to make it tricky so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when it bounces it, like, bounces in another direction.
L:  Ooh.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Very interesting.  Um, it must be on cable TV?
R:  Um, I ha- -- actually I have not seen it ever since I've been in the US.  I've neve- -- I've never seen, ah, cricket being played here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, ah, outsi- outside of the US, especially in, like, the U-- ah, the United Kingdom and m- -- ah, more British colonial countries that's -- it's very, ah, very famous.
L:  Common on TV?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I wonder if it's on -- I bet it's on cable TV on some weird channel, you know.
R:  Oh, I'm sure it would be.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  'Cause they do have, uh, really big, uh, cricket tournaments every year so ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think, ah, people gather round their cable satellite TVs and [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- watch some of the game.
L:  Wow.
R:  How about playing sports?  Do you play any sports?
L:  Um, I -- I've played softball.  I was on a team two years ago.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that was the first time I ever played, like, a team sport.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I tend to do yoga.  I tend to run and do athletics of that sort.  You know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I really like being fit and all but not -- not in really a competitive way.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] I swim, you know.  I do all those things and --
R:  So, basically to -- to keep -- to keep fit rather.
L:  Yeah.  And it --
R:  Not -- that -- 
L:  -- it feels good too --
R:  -- yeah.  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, from, even just keeping you [MN] calm and, you know, just a lot of great things. 
R:  Mhm.
L: But not -- it was fun to be on the softball team, it was nice but I find baseball terribly hard to watch.  It's kinda boring 
R:  Yeah.  Baseball is very boring.   [LAUGH]
L:  Ooh.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Baseball, softball -- actually same like cricket; it's quite boring.  [LAUGH]
L:  Really?  [LAUGH] 
R:  'Cause games will drag on for, like, five hours, six hours and --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- this is the worst thing to get stuck --
L:  And it's -- no. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  A- -- I don- -- I don't particularly care for football either.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, it just isn't the funnest.  But I ah -- both sports I thought I didn't care for at all, but then I started to play both of them and they were both very fun to play.
R:  Yeah.  It is always a difference between playing a sport and watching a sport I guess.
L:  Hm, huge difference.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But basketball, I feel -- I feel like they're just extraordinary athletes.  It's so fun to watch that, you know --
R:  [several inaudible words] 
L:  -- especially a high -- a high, you know, and profile game.
R:  Yeah.  Or even if you're watching your school.  Like, for example, ah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the -- my -- I just, um, went to all the basketball games of my, ah, of my college and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's pretty big, I mean, it was, ah, quite an excitement.  It really raises your school spirit and you tend to enjoy it a lot more if, ah --
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  -- if it's got, like, a personal touch.
L:  Yeah.  But there's something about basketball that's really exciting 'cause they say that baseball is really one of the hardest sports, and those guys are some of the best athletes --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that that's incredibly difficult stuff to do.
R:  I never understood that.  [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause it's a bat on to- -- it's not just your hand and a ball.  There's like a third thing. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  That, you know, makes it so much harder they say.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I don't know; I'm not that -- they don't look like great athletes.
R:  Yeah, I know.  I'm not convinced.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean, they always have big potbellies.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And they don't --
R:  Um -- 
L:  -- it seems like a skill, you know, it's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just a eye -- 
R:  Eye, hand coordination, right.
L:  -- hand coordination thing that, [NOISE] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, it's -- it's weird.
R:  But I --
L:  But, um, [LIPSMACK] I like to watch the Olympics too.
R:  Oh, Olympics are fun to watch.  Do you watch, ah, winter or ...
L:  I watch both.
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  I -- and I even like the, you know, like, I like watching the gymnastics.  I like -- the swimming even can be interesting.
R:  Mhm.
L:  The skating [PAUSE] a- --
R:  Did you watch the skating last year with the whole, ah, what do you call it?  With the whole --
L:  Oh, there was the tie, right?
R:  Yeah, the tie and those -- I think they're -- I think it -- was it the Russians versus the Americans or something?  Or Russians versus the British, or the English?
L:  Y- -- something was a big scandalous thing --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- I remember.  But now I forget about it.  [LAUGH] It's such a big deal and then I -- I've already forgotten what happened.
R:  Yeah, the world keeps spinning.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That tends to be the case.
L:  Yeah.  But yeah, I like that Olympics.
R:  Mhm.
L:  What other good parts of the Olympics do you like?
R:  Um, I think the last Olympics I watched mo- mostly the ice skating.  Ah, I love any -- any of the speed sports.  Like I love watching things like the bob sled or --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- um, like the really high -- high speed sport.  I'm not -- I'm not -- not much of a just a slow sport person.  I don't --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I don't really enjoy watching.
L:  Right.
R:  Like, that's why I don't enjoy softball as much 'cause it's -- it's very slow moving.
L:  It's too slow.  Mhm.
R:  Whereas things like basketball I like.
L:  Yeah, the speed skating is really interesting.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause -- 
R:  Yeah, speed skating is m- --
L:   -- it's just insane how their bodies look.
R:  Yeah, it's crazy.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Totally aerodynamic and --
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  -- just the outfit they're wearing, it's really crazy.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That's true.
L:  Their legs -- the way it photographs, it looks like their legs go out completely sideways, you know.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's so true.
L:  Yeah, it's really strange looking but very exciting, yeah.
R:  Mhm.  Uh, let's see, in terms of sports, I play, um, I used to -- to do long distance running a while back.  A couple of years back.
L:  Oh, you did?
R:  Yeah.  Um, I'm, like, okay; I'm not, like, amazing or anything.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  Um, but it -- it's definitely enjoyable for me. I mean, after -- it's really the first ten minutes of th- that's the hardest of running, but once you get into a rhythm then it's -- then it's fine.  I guess as with, ah, most, ah, endurance sports.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, um, I guess ru- running I always find enjoyable.  I used to play a bit of soccer, um, played a bit of rugby.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Just a -- a bit of everything -- of -- a lot of field hockey in fact that was -- that was the sport I really enjoyed in high school.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, ah, think that's about it I [inaudible] --
L:  When --
R:  -- and there's squash.
L:  -- when you do long distance running, well, how long is long distance?
R:  Um, [PAUSE] I'm -- I'm not talking about, like, ten, fifteen miles; it's more like five miles.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, I think, yeah, three to five miles actually.
L:  Three to five is long distance?  Uh-huh.
R:  But for me it's long distance.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] No, I understand.
R:  [inaudible] run, ah, twenty minutes to thirty minutes of running and that -- that's what I used to do in, ah, in high school and I -- I probably could do a little bit more that that, but I've never actually, ah --
