R:  Hello?
L:  Hello. 
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  Good.  How are you?
R:  Good.  Who's this?
L:  Ah, this is Liz.
R:  Hi, Liz.  I'm Debbie.
L:  Hi, Debbie.
R:  Where are you from?
L:  Um, right now, in Boston.
R:  Oh, me too.  
L:  Where -- how you -- 
R:  [MN].
L:  How'd you get hooked up with this thing?
R:  Um, on the [inaudible] list.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  On the -- I got somebody else yesterday from Boston.  I wonder if they're matching people up?  I got somebody from Springfield.
L:  Oh, I don't know.
R:  This your first time?
L:  Ah, yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.  Um --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- so, professional sports.  What -- what do you --
L:  Professional sports.
R:  -- like to watch on TV?
L:  I watch the baseball on TV.
R:  I watch basketball.  [LAUGH].
L:  Basketball?  
R:  And --
L:  I don't know much about basketball.  I watch basketball with my roommate.  
R:  Okay.  Do you watch, like, all the games of a certain team or just when it's like um playoffs or something like that?
L:  Well, I wish I -- I'm from Minnesota originally so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I wish I could watch my team on television, but they never show them, so --
R:  So do you just watch any -- anyone because --
L:  I watch -- yeah.  I watch almost anything that's on, but which is usually the Braves or some -- some --
R:  I don't -- um, I went to a baseball game.  I didn't like it either.
L:  Oh, no.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  But I -- I guess maybe understanding of it, I don't have --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it in depth, but the basketball, I think has -- in school, like, my roommate was on the girls' basketball team and --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- I -- I used to go to all the games so I think I learned about it.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  But I don't spend -- I don't watch, like, every single Celtics game, but like the playoffs were on recently --
L:  Right.
R:  -- which was two different teams, but I watched --
L:  Right.
R:  -- every single game.
L:  Right.  So I know enough about it.  I know it was the Spurs and the Mets, right?
R:  I know that, too.  [LAUGH].  Yep.
L:  Yes, exactly, so --
R:  And I like --
L:  -- I saw some of that, but not a lot.
R:  I like to watch skating, too.  
L:  Skate, like ice skating?
R:  Yes.
L:  Or the Olympics?
R:  The ice skating.
L:  Yeah.  I like --
R:  Figure.
L:  I like -- I like all of the Olympics.  I like -- I like all of the Olympics except for the background stories on all the athletes.  I get really bored with those.  [LAUGH].
R:  Now, you see, I like that.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, a lot of people do, which is why they show it, so --
R:  Where they're coming from.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  Yeah, their history, like --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- this person grew up in Africa, now they're a bobsled -- yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yes, exactly.
R:  But as far as um -- I also like something I do, which is probably not being a true fan of the sport, is like when it's a big thing, like the Super Bowl --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or --
L:  Right.  Yeah.  Of course I watch the Super Bowl.
R:  I don't like football, but I watched it anyway.  [LAUGH].
L:  Well, I guess -- I watch a lot of college football when it's college football season.  It hasn't been college football season for a while, so I haven't been watching it, but it's um -- that's really fun because my roommates and I um we're all from the Midwest originally, so --
R:  Oh, okay. 
L:  Or at least we root for big town teams, which is mostly Midwest.
R:  Okay.
L:  So --
R:  So you -- 
L:  -- that's kinda fun.
R:  Are you -- you're here for college or --
L:  Ah, I came out for college a number of years ago and I stayed.
R:  Oh, you're still -- um, so I find -- I guess the question is -- I don't know, I didn't -- I should of listened more carefully to, so -- so that how many --
L:  For how many hours a week do you watch sports?
R:  Ah --
L:  On TV?
R:  -- I have to say some weeks, none, and then other weeks, maybe an hour or two.  I don't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't have every week that I'm watching.
L:  I think -- I think for me probably -- 'cause it's either football or baseball season most of the time, so if it [inaudible] probably three or four hours a week.
R:  That's a lot.
L:  I know.  I love sports.  So I also listen to um -- I get -- have the internet radio.
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH].  So I listen to my home team on the internet radio sometimes, which is kinda fun.
R:  And they have a -- also another thing I enjoy watching is tennis.
L:  Oh, tennis?  I --
R:  Because --
L:  -- never watch tennis.
R:  Okay.  Well, I never used to, but then I started watching it, and that gets to -- gets to be kind of -- when it -- you know, like when the US Open's on --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the French Open, that -- I don't like to watch golf.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  No.  Golf.  I can't imagine why anyone would want to watch golf.
R:  I can't -- I can't imagine why anybody would want to play golf.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  But I guess if you're the same thing, or as anything like you're each time say, like, "Okay, I got that hole in nine strokes.  This time I can get it in six".
L:  Right.
R:  I guess it's the same as any other skill.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  You know?  Um but I -- I wouldn't watch that.  So I'd say probably not as much as you do.  You know, I'll watch, I guess, more like event oriented sports.
L:  Right. 
R:  You know?
L:  Right.  Well, I like -- I almost always am watching with people so I mean, the reason I watch college football is not so much because I love college football, although it's fun.  It's because, you know, my roommates now, we sit around and we have our, like, girls' football afternoon, so we drink tea and we quilt and -- and we watch college football.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  Do what?
L:  So --
R:  I thought your roommates -- I was gonna say, what do you have, male roommates?
L:  No.  No.  We're all girls.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  So we all like football.  So I think we're all raised, you know, watching it with our dads, so --
R:  I think it's a good thing, because I think men enjoy that.
L:  Yes.
R:  Because I used to hate football and then, like, I met this guy a few years ago and, like, he explained the game to me.
L:  It's so much better.  [LAUGH].
R:  I didn't understand.  And then so of course, 'cause of the Patriots were in -- you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- N -- yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  So -- oh, yeah, so we're on the phone and I'm like -- he goes, "Oh, I'm watching this".  I go, "All right.  Let me turn it on".
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  And then, you know like, I'd start picking up, like, oh okay, that wa- that didn't look like it was a good idea, you know?  And stuff like that.
L:  Right.
R:  And then all of a sudden within watching four or five games, I understood the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- scoring.
L:  It's so much more fun if you understand it.
R:  But it -- it seems complicated, the scoring, to me.
L:  Right.
R:  Some of it.
L:  Right.  Well, especially if you're at first getting used to it.  I tried to explain baseball to someone who wasn't even from this country once.
R:  Oh.
L:  And it -- it was a nightmare.  [LAUGH].
R:  [MN].
L:  And then they're out when they -- well, yeah, never mind.
R:  I understand the concept of it.  Like, getting to the bases and everything.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  And you know, if you don't hit -- get to the base, you're out and stuff --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- like that, and the cork bat, you know, I understood that.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].  Yeah, I watched that on TV.  I watched poor Sammy get played over and over again on television with his little corked bat.
R:  I thought that was -- that seemed suspicious to me.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  A little bit.  Little bit.
R:  But -- but I guess, you know, you'd think they would know these things.
L:  You would think, but --
R:  And the people working for him of course would be on his side.
L:  Right.
R:  So they wouldn't -- but yeah.
L:  Right.  Naturally.
R:  I guess to practice with it would be okay, but maybe it did --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- get mixed up?
L:  Yeah.  Who knows?  Who knows?
R:  To put a big orange sticker on it, "Caution.  Caution".
L:  I know.  Really.
R:  "Caution.  Corked bat.  Do not use".
L:  Exactly.  How are you -- how exactly --
R:  Do not use --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- for televised games.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  Yeah.
R:  But um, yeah, so that -- so I'd say I'm pretty limited.  I mostly watch it geared towards events like playoffs and Super Bowls.
L:  Right.
R:  And you sound like you would just put it on --
L:  Yeah.  I'll just --
R:  -- if you're home?
L:  -- put it on.  In fact, the only reason I have uh um cable is for ESPN.  
R:  Oh.
L:  So [LAUGH].
R:  I got rid of my cable.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I found I wasn't watching very much TV any more.
L:  We -- we -- we had free cable --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- for a couple years.  It just appeared on our television and then it disappeared and we -- we hadn't planned to get cable.  We didn't have cable when the free cable appeared and -- but then once we got used to it, my roommates and I, like I said, we like to watch college football and that's only on uh cable most of the time, the big games, so --
R:  You got -- you got that by mistake?  Free cable?
L:  Yeah.  It just appeared on our tele- we got a new television and we hooked up the new television, it suddenly had cable.
R:  That is so --
L:  Very strange.
R:  -- bizarre.
L:  Hopefully no cable people listen to these conversations.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].  That's what they mean by cable ready, you just buy the TV and [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, it just appeared.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  So --
L:  So we had that for a couple of -- we didn't bother reporting it since, you know, it was -- just appeared --
R:  And no bill ever -- 
L:  it's not like we --
R:  No bill ever came or anything?
L:  Nuh.  No.  Nothing.  And I mean --
R:  Lucky.
L:  -- we didn't -- I know.  We didn't really even watch it that much, since we didn't -- and there was a reason we didn't pay for cable, but then once it went away, we missed the ESPN and my roommate watches uh, uh, Trading Spaces on the --
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  Got free cable.
R:  I -- I took it off a few uh months ago and it's funny 'cause now I only have eleven or twelve channels and you do miss certain things --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because this is so limited as to what's on.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I got used to VH one and watching --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the documentaries and everything.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  But um I -- I -- so it sounds like you -- you like to watch uh a lot of sports than I --
L:  I do like to watch a lot of sport.
R:  And I don't.
L:  It's true.  That seems --
R:  But that's okay.
L:  That seems to be the --
R:  So um were there other things they wanted to cover in this, or just --
L:  I think they pretty much just said talk about what your favorite sports are and how much you watch them.
R:  Right.  So I'm tennis and basketball and um skating related things.
L:  Yep.  And I'm pretty much baseball and football.  And then I'll watch the Olympics and --
R:  So who's ahead in the baseball now?  The Yankees?
L:  Oh, the Yankees and Boston are kinda fighting it out.
R:  Right.
L:  And Toronto's in the mix, too, in that division.  So my team's doing pretty well, though, my Minnesota team.  So --
R:  The Red Sox always -- they get close and then --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- forget it.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  It'll be --
L:  So I was actually at a game last weekend --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- for the Red Sox, which was nice.  
R:  Did you have a good sea?
L:  It was fun.  We were out in the bleachers, which is the best place, 'cause --
R:  Okay. 
L:  -- seats are so expensive.  There's just no point in paying more than that.
R:  I gr- oh, just like from a company I worked at, they used to go around here and there and give out the corporate tickets.
L:  Right.
R:  And we got in those seats that they always show, behind the batter.
L:  Yeah.
R:  When you're on TV, like?
L:  Yeah.
R:  We -- I got to sit there.  Um, but it was a very hot day and it was, like, really uncomfortable.
L:  Oh [LAUGH].
R:  But it's different, watching it in person, that's for sure.
L:  Yeah.  So watching it on TV is very, like -- I don't know.  Watching it in -- on TV you much more have to be interested in the sport.
R:  But they also explain the stuff to you.
L:  That's true too.
R:  And you can hear it.
L:  That's true.
R:  But when you're sitting there, it's just like --
L:  Yeah.  I find -- yeah.  When I go to the games, it's much more about kind of who I'm going with and --
R:  Just to make a day out of it.
L:  You know.  Yeah.  And you know, you eat the be- eat the beer!  You eat the hotdogs --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- you drink the beer and --
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  -- you know?
R:  How is it look, with the new seats and everything?
L:  Well --
R:  They put -- it's different, cleaned up and -- I haven't been there --
L:  Yeah.  You know, I haven't really -- just there's these new green monster seats.  So --
R:  That's -- that's it?
L:  Yeah.  I haven't really been there for -- for much of that, so --
R:  Oh, right.  Um, I don't know how close --
L:  I think -- I think they -- yeah --
R:  They'll tell us, right?
L:  I think they do tell us, so --
R:  How did you find out about this?
L:  Ah, I worked for a company that I think is using -- or is maybe getting -- like, is involved somehow or like we do language stuff, so -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I guess they're interested in supporting this project.
R:  Well, this is -- on my community called the Craig[?] List, Boston Craig List.
L:  Yeah, I've heard of -- I've heard of Craig List.
R:  Right.  You should check this thing out.  It was the best find ever.
L:  Wow.
R:  People selling things.  So a guy sent a posting on it and said he's been doing it and that, you know?  He said if you want to make ten dollars for a phone call --
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  -- and I filled out the form and everything and then I'm thinking, oh boy, I should not have sent my social out there and everything, but then --
L:  Oh [LAUGH].
R:  -- I got nervous and I wrote to them.  He goes, "No, no, it's legit", and --
L:  Yeah, it's definitely legit.
R:  -- I'm thinking -- I'm thinking, right, right.  Then the next day they called and it -- I just got nervous after I filled the form out.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  That could of been a scam.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  You know?  They had my phone number, my address and my social.  
L:  Yep.
R:  Right?  You got to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You're not supposed to do that.
L:  No.
R:  And I -- I realized it was stupid [LAUGH] afterwards.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  But um anyway, so um that's -- I guess that'd be the end of this, when they --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- write us -- 'cause I don't know what else to say.
L:  Let's see.  What else can we talk about?  Television?  Well, did -- so did you actually watch the basketball playoffs this year or --
R:  I watched the last two games --
