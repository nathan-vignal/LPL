L:  Hello, my name's Cassania[?].  How are you doing?
R:  Just fine, thanks.  This is Pattie.
L:  Hi.  Mm.  So, what's your favorite sport?
R:  Well, I really don't have one.
L:  You don't?
R:  No, I don't believe -- I -- I think it should not even be on TV.
L:  Oh.  So you'd rather get out there and play some basketball or --
R:  Correct.
L:  Yeah, and play --
R:  That's correct.
L:  -- some baseball --
R:  Right.
L:  -- which is, like, one of my favorite things to do.
R:  Right.  I just feel that the um players are making just way too much money.  Things are just out of control.
L:  They're making more money than ten people put together.
R:  [LAUGH].  If -- if not [LAUGH] --
L:  It's horrible.
R:  If not more than that, yeah.  That's why I don't like it.  I just think the way the world's going today that we should have our emphasis on uh something else.
L:  Yeah.
R:  As far as, you know, maybe --
L:  You --
R:  -- teachers or --
L:  Yeah.  Teachers need to make all the money --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because they're the ones that are putting their lives on the line, trying to --
R:  Right.
L:  -- teach us kids how to do the right thing.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?  I think that they're overpaid and, you know, people out here are working so hard for just a little bit of money to stay above their heads and trying to pay their rent and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- then -- then they're sitting up there, being able to pay their rent with one day's worth of work.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  For a whole year.
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  You know?
R:  Right, and their endorsements.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, but --
L:  They -- they make too much money.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know --
R:  And wh-
L:  -- and then they complain about it.  "Oh, we only make five hundred thousand dollars a year".
R:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.
L:  I feel like I'm being used --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and taken advantage of.
R:  Right.  I do agree, though, when they do support, you know, the community or underprivileged or, you know, I'm -- I'm happy to see that, but uh I think they're living way too -- way too much.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, I think so, too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's kinda horrible.
R:  Yeah.  But my husband watches sports all the time, but uh, not me.
L:  Well, the thing with sports is that there's [inaudible] all the time, in the games.  You know?
R:  Mm.
L:  And then it kinda makes it kinda boring just --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to sit there and wait for them to hit the ball.
R:  Right.  And not only --
L:  And --
R:  -- that, but the violence.  The violence that has, you know, come as part of the games.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  It's more violent than wrestling --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to tell you --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the truth.
R:  Right.  For the kids and stuff, it's just not -- I just don't think it sets a good example.  For the amount of money they make, their behavior is, you know, atrocious.
L:  Especially Gerald Strawberry.  You heard about him, right?
R:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.  
L:  Him taking out prostitutes and --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- cheating on his poor wife.
R:  Right.
L:  His loyal, dedicated wife.
R:  Right.  Right. 
L:  You know, and just --
R:  Right.
L:  -- doing cocaine and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, and that.  And then the kids look at that --
R:  Right.  That they think --
L:  -- you know, and they're like, "Huh?  I want to be like him", or --
R:  Yeah, right.  Right.
L:  Well, Denis Rodman was somebody --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in particular, too.
R:  Right.
L:  All of the kids tried to fashion themselves after him.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  But, you know --
R:  No --
L:  -- he's kinda stupid, anyway.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  He doesn't even pay his child support.
R:  No.  That's sad.  
L:  You know?  
R:  Yeah.
L:  He -- he's pretty pathetic.  I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- he makes all that money and he can't even pay his child support.
R:  Right.  I mean, there are some role models, but it's ge- I think it's just getting worse.  That's why I don't participate.  I mean, my husband loves it.  You know, football --
L:  But you're not gonna be --
R:  -- baseball --
L:  -- one of the viewers that help boost --
R:  No.
L:  -- their ratings?
R:  No.  No.
L:  In order for them to --
R:  No.
L:  But you won't even get a ticket to go to the game, right?
R:  Well, I've gone -- I've gone to the -- a Philly's game.  I went last year, you know, a Philly's --
L:  But you were bored, I bet, out of your mind?
R:  Well, no, it's okay.  It was nice to be there.  It was nice to -- it was better to be there than to watch it on TV.
L:  I bet you were screaming, "Come on, now".
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  "Do it".  I bet by the time you walked out of there, you were just hoarse.
R:  [LAUGH].  No, I wasn't --
L:  But --
R:  -- screaming, but I thought it -- you know, I thought it was interesting, but I don't make a habit of promoting sports.  
L:  Did you have binoculars when you went?
R:  No.  Uh-huh.
L:  You didn't?
R:  No.  
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  It's -- I think it's kinda um funny.  I think a lot of the sports are kinda funny.  It'd be kinda funny if no one bought tickets and everybody just turned it off their TV.
R:  Yeah.
L:  To think it -- that they would just actually lose all their profits.
R:  Right. 
L:  And the people just quit buying all their --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- their -- you know, but the thing is, whenever they sell a product, the stuff is really good.  They really --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- don't even need the person to promote it.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  But it just helps the endorsements.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  You know, and -- you know.  But, you know, they must be making a lot of money because sometimes they donate a lot of stuff to the Maury Povich Show.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah.  Sometimes the --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- the -- the basketball players and baseball players, they see a underprivileged child, with maybe a --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- handicap or a particular --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [inaudible] and they sit up there and they say, "Well, here's enough tennis shoes to last you a year and come to the game and we're gonna pay for you to watch each game for a week and we're gonna pick up the hotel stub for a week" and --
R:  Okay.  Well, that's a good thing.  That's --
L:  Get whatever you want.
R:  That's -- as long as they're doing something positive, but --
L:  "Here's jerseys and tee shirts and here's --"
R:  Mm.
L:  "-- my autograph for -- you know, with my signature across it".
R:  Mm.
L:  You know, I -- and I see the kid crying and all happy and everything and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just loving it and it kinda puts a tear in my eye, too.
R:  Oh, okay.  Well then, that's a -- you know, as long as it's a good positive um attitude, sure, but uh a lot of times it isn't.
L:  I think wrestling, too, Stone Cold Steve Austin, um, donated like about ten thousand dollars to this one little girl.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  You know, worth of stuff, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Just um -- just like his wrestling jersey and, you know, he gave her all his videotapes and you know, he gave her a big hug --
R:  [COUGH].
L:  -- and gave her a beautiful um pure bred dog 'cause her other dog had died.
R:  Oh.
L:  And he gave her a pure bred dog and she's just, "I'm gonna name the dog right after you" and then I just like, oh, boo hoo.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, because I thought that was really beautiful when you know they show that they really care and they have a heart and they're just giving hugs and kisses, that's you know, that -- that's a beautiful thing.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  You know, and I think Sugar Ray Leonard, boxer, and um you know, just -- I see him out there and he's fighting and, you know, dame -- donating his ch- his money to the community center.
R:  Mhm.
L:  In his old neighborhood.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  To help uh children that are poor, that can't get meals for the lunch program.
R:  Okay.
L:  During the summer time.
R:  That's what I want them to do.  I want them to take -- give back.  Give back to the people that, you know, are supporting them.
L:  Well, I like the fact that he gave um tennis shoes to all the kids --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that were +underprivileged uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- privileged -- um, didn't have a lot --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they sent -- they shipped a lot of tennis shoes over --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- to the community center and then each kid would come up and say what their size was and they distributed tee shirts --
R:  Wow.  Yeah, that --
L:  -- you know, with that, and I thought --
R:  Yeah, that's good.
L:  -- that was beautiful.  
R:  That's good.  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  That's good.
L:  I saw all those poor kids walking around with, you know, hundred dollar tennis shoes on.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they're like, "I got these tennis shoes and they're gonna last me for a whole year" and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you know, "It helps my mother" you know?  And then the mothers are, like, "Oh, he's so sweet".
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, "He's so nice" and you know?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  'Cause, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- inflation, now where they take all your money nowadays.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  And, you know, when they did the lunch program, it was helping the parents --
R:  Right.
L:  -- out tremendously.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Because they didn't have to worry about their kids.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  And uh, you know, it was nice.  It was just beautiful.  
R:  Right.
L:  You know, I was just, like, that's really sweet of them to try to be that kind.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, when you see somebody with a beautiful heart, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- then I -- then I can -- then I could see it, but those money grabbing ones, oh my God.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  
R:  See, they all should give back.  You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think they all should --
L:  I mean, Michael --
R:  -- they oughta say, you know, that they're blessed and they have all this money and then let's take care of -- 'cause a lot of them came from inner city or poor sections and need, you know --
L:  Yeah.  Even OJ did.
R:  Right, and know, you know, what it's like.  
L:  Yeah.  Like, go without.
R:  Right.
L:  To starve.
R:  Right. 
L:  To not have enough --
R:  So take -- you know, take care --
L:  -- to make ends meet.
R:  -- of the education and the -- you know, the -- especially the education of these kids.  I think that's very important.
L:  Well, you know what?  They should just be giving the money to the teachers.  Teachers should be making a hundred thousand dollars a year each.
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  They should take the money away from the -- the players --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and say, "Look, if you don't want to play for two hundred thousand dollars a year, then we'll find somebody who is poor --"
R:  Right.
L:  "-- who needs that money --"
R:  Right.
L:  " -- and we could just replace your butt".
R:  Mm.  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  You know, "We will replace your stupid butt", you know?
R:  [LAUGH] yeah.
L:  "And we'll take the money and give it to teachers.  The doctors don't need money 'cause they got more money than they can shake a hand at.
R:  Mhm.  That's right.
L:  Yeah, and doctors are rich, you know?
R:  Yeah.  Right.
L:  And uh --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I think that the teachers, you know -- I -- they shouldn't go on strike anymore.  They should just give them the money.
R:  Right.  
L:  Give them their bonuses, give them their vacation time.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?  They --
R:  Right.
L:  -- are the ones that are volunteering their extra time after school to make sure --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- the homework is done properly.
R:  Sure.
L:  But they're not even looking at that.
R:  Uh-huh.  No.
L:  The teachers need the money.
R:  Right.
L:  Give it to the teachers.
R:  Right.
L:  Give it to, um, people that need money to live.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, and people at the restaurant industry, they should be getting more money, too.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, people working --
R:  Like a lot of people.
L:  -- working at McDonalds -- huh?
R:  A lot of people.  [LAUGH].  A lot --
L:  Making seven, eight bucks --
R:  -- of people should be get --
L:  -- an hour.  You know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- four and five people are living together in an apartment?
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  You know, and like one bedroom is going for eight, nine hundred dollars a month.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  You know, down here in Seattle --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- two bedrooms is like over a thousand bucks.
R:  My gosh.
L:  Two and three people have to live in one apartment now.
R:  Mm.  Mhm.
L:  You know?  Why is it that somebody's sitting up there, busting their butt at McDonalds, Burger King or Wendy's, you know, is making -- you know, so little and then --
