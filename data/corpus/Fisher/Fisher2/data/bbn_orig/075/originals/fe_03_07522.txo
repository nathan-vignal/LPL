L:  Adam.
R:  Cindy.  Um, well, I think they could start with giving everyone smallpox in- -- vaccinations.
L:  Oh, I agree definitely.  I mean, that would be a tremendous help.  Uh, I think we'd h- -- I think just, I mean, to stop terrorism at all, uh, you just have to politically be there for other people.  Uh, you got to stop all this violence, I guess.
R:  Yeah, the trick is how to do that [LAUGH].
L:  Right, uh, right, but that's what we -- that's the whole idea.  I mean, that's why we entrust power to these people is because we hope they have the ability to do things like that.
R:  Yeah.  I think having a consistent foreign policy would help things along a bit but I don't see that happening any time soon.
L:  No, me neither, me neither. [NOISE] So, where are you calling from?
R:  Alabama.
L:  I live in Colorado here.
R:  Oh, you must be having better weather.
L:  Oh, it's actually kind of rainy today.
R:  Is it cool out there at least?
L:  It is.  It definitely is [LAUGH].  How about you guys?
R:  Like ninety.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  It's awful.
L:  [LAUGH] That's hot.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh, I don't know.  Bio t- -- I really don't know, uh, how you can stop it in any way.  I mean, doesn't -- I guess they seem to have done what?  The terrorist attacks in America seem to happen so sporadically.  I mean, they're not one after the other.  It's hard to tell.
R:  Yeah, but if we weren't dependant on other countries for oil --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- it shouldn't be much of a problem.
L:  W- which, you know, [MN] we don't have to be, you know.  They have that corn fuel and they have electric cars.  I mean, they [MN] -- they don't have to be dependant on fuel.  It's America's choice that we're dependant on fuel.
R:  I know.  That's my job.  I work with renewable power [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] That must be a pretty interesting job.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.
R:  Beats working in McDonald's, huh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It just pays about as bad [LAUGH].
L:  Right.  It just seems pretty weird talking to somebody for ten minutes.
R:  I know.
L:  How many times have you done it?
R:  This is my second call.
L:  Same here.  I've been putting it off.
R:  But at a dollar a minute who can refuse [LAUGH]?
L:  Right, I mean, really, exactly.  I wonder -- I mean, I wonder what the whole test is about.  I'm doing this for my -- for actually a class I was volunteered --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, for this class and we have to do it for that.
R:  Yeah, I wonder what the purpose of this is, too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's terror bizarre.
L:  Mhm.  It is [NOISE].  So, do you have kids or anything?
R:  Yeah, the whole lot.
L:  Nice.  I have a dog.  That's it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] The trouble is is I try and practice what I preach so I have no air conditioning.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah, just fans.
L:  And I -- I'm the same way actually, yeah.
R:  It's like that in Alabama.
L:  I bet not, I bet not.  I actually used to live in Louisiana and I'm -- I remember the weather being pretty foul there.
R:  Yeah, they've got hot and muggy there, too.
L:  Yeah.  So, what time is it there?  Is it like five?
R:  Um, yeah, it's five thirteen.
L:  Wow.
R:  We've been talking for five minutes [LAUGH].
L:  Nice.
R:  It's not quite on the subject but [LAUGH] --
L:  That's okay.  It makes no difference I don't think.
R:  [LAUGH] I hope it doesn't [LAUGH].
L:  I don't think it would.  I bet they won't even listen to these things for another couple of years.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  There's probably so many of them.
R:  I wondered how they could afford to get the funding.  Apparently this has been going on since fall.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, definitely.  But it is -- it is weird.
R:  Very weird.
L:  Well, I know it's -- it's what -- it's the University of, uh, Pennsylvania, I believe and they're pretty loaded.
R:  Must be.
L:  So, I'm sure that has a lot to do with it.
R:  I wish I could get a grant like that [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, uh-huh [NOISE].
R:  So, what do you study?
L:  I'm a journalism major --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- but, uh, actually my -- I'm actually a script writing major but they don't -- they don't offer that as, like, an actual major so the closest thing is creative writings, journalism, so those are my two main ones and, uh, I graduate in about six months.  I've been writing for the local rock p- -- like, magazine that -- here in Colorado for a couple of years now.
R:  Ah, someone else with a nonpaying job [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, exactly.  That's very, very true.  I s- -- actually work in the bookstore at school as well for real money.
R:  That's what I do.  I do these things for real money [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, renewable power doesn't pay as much as it's become a money pet.  
L:  R- --
R:  We try save more money.
L:  Right, right, I'm sure.  I'm sure.
R:  It becomes like an addiction and there's always some new gadget to get, uh, something to build and test.
L:  Right.  I think you have some pretty cool stuff, though.
R:  Yeah, yeah, and when the power goes out I'm the only one of the block [LAUGH] with stuff.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Kids are still sitting there watching TV, a little TV but watching TV [LAUGH].
L:  Right.  So, after we've finished doing -- after the third one we get paid they say.
R:  That's what they say, in a few weeks after that.
L:  Yeah, I hope they come through.
R:  Me, too.
L:  You can never tell with these things.
R:  I heard about this on a board called Fat Wallet, Fat Wallet dot com.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I mean, as I said, I had a -- a teacher n- -- from my class who knew about it, found out about it and wanted one of us to do it, so, I volunteered.
R:  Well, everybody else on the board says they've been paid so [LAUGH] --
L:  Well, that's nice.  That's cool, then.  Wow, that's a really easy thirty bucks.
R:  Yep.
L:  It's so weird.
R:  They have lots of things like that on that board though, all the surveys to get paid for and, like, free stuff people can get.
L:  That's so neat.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, it's funny, like, working for this magazine as I get free CD's, like, constantly sent to me by just unknown bands.  It's really funny and j- -- I don't know, I get invited to all sorts of their shows and, I don't know.  It's awkward but it's pretty cool sometimes.
R:  That must be very cool at your age.
L:  Yeah, I mean, like, some, you know, when, like, a bigger band comes through like -- like Blues Tradwork is coming through on the fourth and I -- I get to interview them and that's kind of neat but, like, I don't know.  When you take, like, a bunch of local bands you've never heard of and they're begging you to come and see their shows it's a little -- it gets a little tense sometimes.  Late nights.
R:  I think of all the bribes you can take from them [LAUGH].
L:  And you --n -- hi- -- you know, I've actually b- -- not so much money but I've been definitely been offered stuff and, you know, had to turn it down just because I couldn't.  If I did I'd get in trouble --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- if anybody found out.
R:  Guess it would be a little unethical.
L:  Yeah, just a little [LAUGH].
R:  Years and years ago I wrote for a travel magazine "Escape" --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but my boss expected me to take stuff so [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, sure, take it.  Uh, what did you get?  Anything good pass it over to me.  Keep the rest [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  But I hate writing so --
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- didn't stay long, yeah.
L:  That's -- that's my bread and butter.  It's what I like doing.
R:  As you can probably tell from this phone call I run out of things to say [LAUGH].
L:  Right.  I mean, uh, yeah, but who doesn't on these things.  It's so awkward, you know, being forced to talk to strangers, you know, for ten minutes.
R:  That's true.
L:  You know.
