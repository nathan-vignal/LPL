L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  I'm --
L:  I'm Dave.
R:  -- Elaine from New York.
L:  What -- what's your name?
R:  Elaine.
L:  Elaine?
R:  Mm.
L:  Mine's Carl from Louisiana.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Ah, how is it in Louisiana today?
L:  Uh, wet and humid.
R:  Uh, here it's -- uh, you know, it's actually sunny today.
L:  [LAUGH] Uh-huh.
R:  We're not --
L:  So --
R:  -- having a really good summer 'cause it's been raining most of the time anyway, so ...
L:  Mhm.  Well, it was here up until about last week, then it started and don't know when to quit.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't -- I don't hear so well and I didn't under- -- uh, I can hear you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- good but I didn't understand that recording.  What are we supposed to talk about?
R:  Uh, sports.
L:  Sports.
R:  Yeah and what your --
L:  I --
R:  -- favorite sport is, you know.
L:  Well, uh --
R:  And how much do you watch of it. [LAUGH]
L:  And on TV.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Uh, I'm funny about that.  Uh, I like some sports but I don't -- I don't watch them too much on TV.  I'm the kind of feller --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, I don't want to watch people having fun, I want to do it. [LAUGH]
R:  You want to participate, right.
L:  So, how 'bout you?
R:  I'm the same way.  I -- I'm just like, look, I'd rather -- yeah, you know what?  I'd -- I'd rather be active in it, than watch it on TV.  I'm not a couch potato when it comes to sports. [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, like a lot of people are.
L:  And, uh, it kind of aggravates me too --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- 'cause --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- hell, I might be outnumbered but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it seems like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, we got a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we got a cable but just a small cable but it seems like every show is -- particularly on a weekend, is -- I mean, it could be racing, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- golf, football, basketball, baseball --
R:  Baseball.
L:  -- some kind of sports but here again, you know, I -- I'd rather watch a movie --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, I agree with you a hundred percent.  I'm not a big sports enthusiast.  I'd ra- -- you know what?  I'd rather play it than watch it --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- you know [NOISE].  And I hate to say this but this is my personal opinion.  I think a lot of athletes, pro athletes, are overpaid for what they --
L:  Way --
R:  -- do.
L:  Uh, it's --
R:  You know.
L:  -- unreal.  Way overpaid.
R:  I think that --
L:  Uh, I just --
R:  -- I th- -- you know, a lot of people gonna disagree with me, like, "Oh, yeah but they're really great and voulez vous".  You know what?  Because we make them great.
L:  Exactly.
R:  We hike them up --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, we attend the s- -- the -- the sporting events, you know and stuff like that.  We watch them on TV, we make a big deal out of them, just like we make a big deal of actors --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know. [NOISE]
L:  Exactly.  And that's why they're getting -- they get the fame.
R:  That's why they have the big egos, that's why they ask for the salaries they ask for.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.
L:  Well, they go on a -- a -- what do they call it?  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, oh, I can't think of the word.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  When you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when you go against something, like a strike, you know, uh --
R:  Right, right, like a --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- boycott?
L:  Boycott.  That's the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- word I'm trying to think of.
R:  Yeah.  Because I -- I think they make too much money as it is, for something that they do, you know.
L:  Yeah, the --
R:  Seems that -- I mean it's not anything that helps society.
L:  Ex- --
R:  'Cause teachers --
L:  -- exactly.  I mean --
R:  -- are underpaid.
L:  -- it's -- it's entertain- --
R:  You know.
L:  -- -ment.  If it was a scientist now, or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a doctor, er, you know, doctors get paid good well.  I think they --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- deserve it, you know.  They --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- save lives and you know but just -- just for entertainment ...
R:  Right.
L:  Uh --
R:  And they get most of their money from --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- endorsements --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know.  Whatever they plug --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on TV, whether it's a soft drink or, er, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  Some type of, uh, a -- you know, like sporting equipment or whatever.
L:  Right.
R:  They make more money from that than playing the sport that they're actually good [LAUGH] at. [LAUGH]
L:  Er, right.
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] Which I think --
L:  So --
R:  -- is ironic.
L:  So, what is --
R:  You know.
L:  -- your favorite, if you have one?
R:  If I had one, I think it'd be tennis.
L:  Is that right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And --
L:  Well, mine --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, we call it sport --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I like hunting.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But e- even then, you know, unless I can learn something --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- uh, I -- I don't want to watch hunters going out shooting something.
R:  Yeah, I don't think so [NOISE] either.
L:  Yeah --
R:  I don't think it's, uh --
L:  -- I want to do it myself. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah, of course, [LAUGH] of course --
L:  And --
R:  -- there's more fun in that, yeah.
L:  I -- I -- I, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and -- and -- and as far as hunting goes, I -- I, uh, set myself apart from these people with --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- guides.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- I don't want a guide.  I want to go --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I want to do the whole thing myself.
R:  Mhm.
L:  If I gotta to have somebody show me --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, where the animal is, you know, er, well, you know, I figure he's done that, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- I want to go --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- find him, hunt him and -- and get --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- him and get him out and clean him and do the whole nine yards.
R:  Right, that's part of the fun --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- of it.
L:  That's -- that's -- it is with me.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I may be in a minority but, uh ...
R:  No, you don't like taking shortcuts, yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, I -- I just -- I mean, to -- you know, with me, with sports, it's just like, okay, these athletes are overpaid and they have -- their egos are too bloated, you know.  They think they're all that and I'm just like, "Okay".  But God forbid if they -- if they ever had a serious injury, they'd be out of the picture.
L:  Oh, right. They don't --
R:  Where will they be if they don't have anything else to fall back on?
L:  Right.
R:  You know [NOISE].  And it happens.  Like these football players, they get a serious knee injury or something --
L:  Mm, they're out of it.
R:  -- or their pad- -- yeah, they're out of it.  You know, they -- they could be making a million dollars a year and then what happens?
L:  Yeah --
R:  You know.
L:  -- they'd better --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they'd better save some of that --
R:  Some of them --
L:  -- and that's it.
R:  -- some of them don't learn.  They don't save it, they don't invest it, nothing.
L:  R- right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's it.
R:  They don't --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- have anything else --
L:  -- if they're out of --
R:  -- to fall back on.
L:  -- the sport, they're out of the thing, you know --
R:  Well, that's true.
L:  -- they're down the --
R:  And when you're a --
L:  [several inaudible words] --
R:  -- pro athlete --
L:  -- [several inaudible words] --
R:  -- you retire a lot earlier than -- than people from other different, uh, types of employment, you know.
L:  That's right.
R:  I mean, you -- you'll -- you'll be retired by the age of forty.  So, then what do you get to do? [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Boy --
R:  You know.
L:  -- boy but there again, with all that money, I guess, they ought to be able to -- of course money isn't everything.
R:  That's true.
L:  But, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, a- and I was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- thinking too, it's -- it's not bad enough they give them so much, then there's ones that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that do like that baseball player, the other day, put cork in his bat --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so he could --
R:  Right.  Sammy --
L:  -- get home --
R:  -- Sosa.
L:  -- runs, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That -- that just -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, tho- those people are role models but then they do something like that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know and man, that -- that just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, just blows my mind, you know --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- as far as -- what kind of role model is that?  Somebody that makes big money and then has to cheat to do it.
R:  That's true.
L:  You know.  Uh.
R:  That's very true.
L:  [LIPSMACK] So, uh, how 'bout these Williams girls?  Didn't they lose in France here a while back?
R:  I think they --
L:  I don't think --
R:  -- did.
L:  -- France was too happy with them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, but it -- here again, I think they're good at what they do but yet, I don't know.  I ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Of course, well, I'm -- I'm not too happy with France.  Er, it might be getting off the subject but [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with their, you know, deal in the war here.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Right, right.
L:  What else?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Uh, well, I'm not a big, uh, [NOISE] professional sports fan, so, yeah, you know, unfortunately, I can't really say to them, [NOISE] anything that positive about [NOISE] it. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, that --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- yeah, that's -- that's the same here --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- 'cause, uh -- uh, it -- I'll -- if I'm at somebody's house and they're watching it, well, I'll watch --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it, you know like --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- er, I don't hate it but, er, uh, when I'm at home, I -- I don't think I've sat down and watched any whole game.  Uh, maybe I -- I take that back.  Wrestling, I -- I might have watched wres- -- but I don't do that as a habit.  That's on occasion.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  You know.  And that's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I think a lot fake there.  They just put on a big show.
R:  Right.
L:  Uh [MN] --
R:  Well, I mean, there was a golf tournament.  I think there was a woman in a male golf tournament and some of the male golfers had, er -- made a big stink about that.
L:  Oh, that -- that wasn't too long ago --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- yeah, that was here you know, even though --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't watch it and, uh, every now and then I've been watching --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the news or something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you'll catch a piece of it and that's it.  And --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't think she won.  But like you say, uh --
R:  No but she gave them a run for their money but --
L:  Uh, yeah, that --
R:  -- some of the -- some of the male golfers --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- protested.  They didn't want to --
L:  I -- I don't --
R:  -- participate in the tournament.  I think that's wrong too.  I'm just like, "Look [LAUGH] --"
L:  Uh, yeah, she's --
R:  "-- she's good, so, why not?"
L:  In fact, it looked like they would be glad to have her 'cause to me, supposedly, er, men [NOISE] normally are stronger and can do better and maybe they were just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- +afraid -- afraid she would [LAUGH], uh, [NOISE] show them up or something.
R:  True.
L:  It's too bad --
R:  True.
L:  -- she didn't. [LAUGH]
R:  True.  
L:  But, uh, yeah, there's -- there's some things, you know, I feel that maybe women shouldn't be in, like football or boxing but here again, I guess, if they want to do it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- well, let them go do it. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  I wouldn't want my wife doing something like that.
R:  [NOISE] I can understand that.  
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I can understand.  'Cause that's a full contact sport, that's head --
L:  Well, that's it --
R:  -- on, you know.
L:  -- and -- yeah and it's rough, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, uh, [LIPSMACK] I don't know.  Even two women fighting, that just -- to me, that degrades women --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- As far as I'm concerned, even though --
R:  I -- I agree with you --
L:  -- it's a --
R:  -- I agree with you.
L:  -- sporting event, it still --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- men, you can see, uh, they like to sh- show how tough they are and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they can duke it out --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- women [LAUGH], you know, uh, I just -- I don't know.  And here again, I might be in a minority but, uh --
R:  That's true.  But you know what I do like -- I do enjoy watching, are the Olympics.
L:  Oh, yes.  Now it --
R:  I mean, it's competitive but it's --
L:  Some of them are --
R:  It's clean --
L:  -- skillful.
R:  -- it's not -- it's not as -- you know.
L:  Exactly.  I -- I know what you mean.  I -- uh, I will watch some Olympic things, uh --
R:  I think it's tasteful and a little more --
