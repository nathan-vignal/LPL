R:  [NOISE] Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  This is Lily Williams.
L:  Hi, Lily.  My name is Jen Caplin.
R:  Okay.
L:  How are you?
R:  Nice to talk with you.
L:  You too.
R:  Well, um, should I start?
L:  Sure, go ahead.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, I think to prevent, you know, the whole bioterrorist attack thing, I think we m- -- need to just make peace with a lot of the countries that have problems with us, you know, by any means necessary, [MN] um, for example, I think with Korea they pose a threat.  I think, you know, whatever the problem is, which I'm not really sure the exact problem, I think that we should try some way to reconcile the problem instead of, you know, attacking them or, you know, using a violent means that would provoke them.  I think it would be a good idea to, you know, just try to reconcile with the countries that pose a threat with bioterrorism.  What do you think?
L:  I agree with you a hundred percent.  I don't see any point in wasting billions and billions of dollars in anti terrorist measures --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, security measures, ah, you know, security at the airport, ah, policemen on the street.  If --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ah, someone really wants to attack the United States they're going to ta- -- attack the United States and I think that a much better course of action is to just be a little more amenable to other people's ideas.
R:  Yeah, I agree, 'cause particularly like you mentioned with, um, the, you know, at the airport you have the measures that everyone has to take and sometimes you have to take off your shoes.  It's, like, getting to the point where, you know, parts of our freedom, you know, is -- it becomes sacrificed, you know, when we take such measures, like, or the measures we consider to be preventative, [MN] it's like they're almost taking our freedom with those measures and, like you said, you know, it's much better to, you know, make peace rather than sacrifice a lot of our everyday freedoms and, you know, make everyone nervous and create this kind of [LIPSMACK] hysteria across the country of, you know, worrying about whether or not, you know, we're going to get attacked and if we can drink Coke products because, you know, they may have attacked the Coke company or, you know, what have you, [MN] if there's just a sense of peace, I think, you know, that would help and things would be much better than how they are now, you know.
L:  I totally agree.  I think that the security measures are both too much and too late.  It's at the point where, like, your ordinary citizens feel harassed --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when they go anywhere or do anything.  Whenever you see a cop you feel guilty without even having done anything --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the fact of the matter is that they're not really going to catch anyone doing anything --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- the way they're going about it.  The airport thing, the airplane thing, it's been done already.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't think that any terrorist would be stupid enough to try that again even without these ridiculous stepped up measures. [MN]
R:  I agree.
L:  It would not be an original --
R:  Right.
L:  -- way to go about things.
R:  And, you know, another issue is that, you know, like, now, like, stereotypes are created, so there are American citizens, you know, who are of different nationalities that are getting harassed and it's like, kind of, you know, out of control type of thing because, you know, everyone who isn't, you know, the, you know, of the typical black or white or Hispanic descent is kind of seen as suspect, you know, [MN] and that's why a lot of hate crimes are -- have derived, you know.  It's all because we're not really handling the bioterrorist thing, you know, correctly and people are getting attacked and stereotypes are being portrayed all Arabs as, you know, bad or all Muslims as bad or what have you so, you know ...
L:  [MN] Do you feel threatened because I don't.  I don't wake up in the morning and say, I don't know if I'm going to go into the city today because I'm afraid that there might be a bioterrorism attack.  I just don't. 
R:  Really?  [MN] To tell you the truth, I do feel threatened.  It doesn't really affect, you know, my everyday activities but it -- there is a sense of worriation[?], like, for example, I have to go to New York in a month or so and, you know, in the back of my head, you know, I'm really apprehensive about getting on an airplane into New York and I'm actually so apprehensive that I'm probably going to have my parents to drive me there [MN] and, you know, I was even considering not doing my internship because I was worried, you know, that another attack might occur in New York so I wi- -- I will say that, yeah, it has me worried [MN] quite a bit but it doesn't affect my a- activities too much, not too much.  It just makes me worry a whole lot, 'cause I've been on a plane, you know, since September eleven but I was, like, so nervous and so worried that the trip was just terrible for me. [MN] So, it really has affected me in that way, unfortunately.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause I live right outside of New York and I've flown several times since September eleventh and, if anything, I just -- I feel just harassed wherever --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I go.  I'm tired of taking off my shoes.  
R:  [MN]
L:  I don't even wear my shoes --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- in the airport any more.  I take 'em off in the car and carry them 'cause I'm sick of taking them off --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and putting them back on.
R:  [LAUGH] I know, like, when, um, when I did go, um, fly for the first time after that incident, that was like my first time flying alone, period, so, you know, I was already nervous but then I go in there and there was, like, all these army men in fatigue and it's kind of scary and then they, like, I basically had to take off everything, my earrings, my belt, my shoes, my hat, and I was just, like, you know, I felt like I was a terrorist or something, like I did some thing wrong 'cause it's so invasive, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You have to take off your belt and take off your shoes and it's -- it's just extremely invasive, like, you know, I said, it's really invading in a lot of our everyday freedoms, you know, we can't just go in the airport and have our luggage scanned.  There's so much more now. [MN] So, and then the -- the thing with Korea.  I don't even think that's resolved at all.  I think it's kind of up in the air since our focus is on, you know, the war, you know, over in Iraq now.  I think that the problems with Korea have been overlooked and, you know, they are, what, defrosting the, ah, t- -- the bio nuclear warfare that they're under contract not to.  Do you know -- you know what I'm talking about?  Do --
L:  I haven't been really following.
R:  Oh, you haven't? [MN] See, I'm so nervous, I'm, like, I'm on everything, I, like, keep up with everything but in -- with, I know, with Korea, um, Clinton had them sign a contract to keep, um, these bio nuclear whatever, like warfare type things, frozen so they, you know, i- -- they were under contract to keep them frozen but now they're defrosting these, ah, types of warfare, whatever, so that, you know, they can be used if they want 'em to be used and they can reach California if they want 'em to reach California and so the issue with that it just seems like totally overlooked and, like, the focus is so on Iraq now that, you know, I think they could possibly be a threat to us as well. [MN] That's what --
L:  Well, I feel that we could be a threat to them as well.  I don't understand why the United States has the right to bear all of these arms that no one else seems to have the right to.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We have the most destructive arsenal in the entire universe and no one in the United States seems to be questioning that.
R:  Mhm. [MN] You're right.  We are -- well, [MN] I was under the impression actually that, you know, that they had things in Iraq that were not necessarily equivalent to, you know, our technology but to, you know, do a massive amount of destruction anyway or pose a threat and I was under that impression with Korea as well that, you know, they're kind of not exactly on our level but, you know, [MN] close enough on -- to our level of technology and warfare and things like that.  So, that's why, I guess, I was a little nervous in that respect 'cause I never really considered that we have, ah, you know, most power or most arsenal warfare.  I never really considered that. [MN] Yeah.  [NOISE] Hello?
L:  I think it's just, like, an issue of fairness.  I mean, the United States is a fairly aggressive country in terms of international politics and I think that a lot of attacks that the United States has waged have been unprovoked or, if not unprovoked, not entirely warranted and yet no one seems to question the fact that we have weapons of mass destruction.  We've used weapons of mass destruction.  We're the only country that's every used a nuclear arm in attack against another country [MN] and, um, if we can have them I don't see any reason why Iraq can't.  I don't see any reason why Korea can't.
R:  Mm.  [MN] Yeah.  I guess it's kind of one of those things, you know, like, you know, since we are, like, the major super power that, you know, it -- it is almost, like, you know, we can and they can't because we're the super power type of situation and I think a lot of, you know, American citizens have internalized that and I guess that's why, you know, a lot of people are in support of the war and are supporting, you know, us as an aggressive nation because they've intern- --
