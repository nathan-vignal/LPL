L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi. [LAUGH]
L:  I'm Aaron.
R:  Aaron?
L:  Yeah.
R:  My name's Celia.
L:  Hi, how ya doing?
R:  I'm fine thanks.  How are you?
L:  Good.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] so, what do you watch on TV?
L:  Uh, well, I watch a lot of football, uh, and basketball and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- hockey.
R:  And hockey?
L:  Yeah.  What about you?
R:  Er, well, I -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I don't think I've ever watched hockey. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, where are you located?
L:  Uh, right outside of Philadelphia.  What about you?
R:  Okay.  Well, that's why the -- I'm in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Florida.
L:  Uh, oh, you guys have a team, the Tampa Bay Lightning.
R:  Yeah, we do.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, it's just -- eh, the reason that I watch so much sports is because my husband always [LAUGH] has them on --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so, um, that's -- you know, he watches [NOISE] the basketball and football.  We don't watch baseball really.
L:  No, you know what?  I watch it every so often but I really can't sit through a whole game on TV.
R:  I can't either.  I -- I love to go in person.  I love to go to the -- to the ballpark.
L:  Yeah, you know what?  It's much more fun when you actually go there.
R:  It is.  Baseball --
L:  I --
R:  -- is just too slow for TV, I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- think.
L:  It's the same thing with golf.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, well --
L:  I -- I love to play golf but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I cannot watch it on TV.
R:  Well, my husband used to, um -- he -- he worked at a -- at a, um -- at a golf club down here --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- Baltimore and was a, um -- a pro and, um, [LIPSMACK] so, he -- he loves it but he -- you know, he turns it on, he falls asleep [LAUGH], so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but actually, I don't mind watching golf on TV too much.  Um, er, when you go in person, it's hard to see anything.
L:  Yeah, yeah, I've never been --
R:  -- you know, you're --
L:  -- to one in person.  My friend has, he said it was pretty fun but --
R:  Well, you're just -- it's gotten so popular, you know and you're --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- waiting from tee to tee and there's such a huge crowd --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that it's really hard to see anything.
L:  My friend just is like, yeah, you get a beer at every tee [LAUGH] or something.
R:  Yeah, exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And -- and on television, I'm just amazed at the way they can follow the ball.  You know, like this --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- tiny little ball and they'll follow it all the way from the time it's hit, all the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- way 'til it [NOISE] -- 'til it, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- stops and so, um, [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] --
L: Yeah but --
R:  -- eh, you get a lot better view that way.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Well, who's your favorite football team?
L:  Uh, definitely the Eagles.
R:  The Eagles [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- okay. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Being in Philadelphia.
R:  We have a -- we have a -- a sister and a brother-in-law in Philadelphia.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  They're just getting ready to move, uh, back to Kansas City.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  But, um, yeah, they've really been following the teams and -- and like kind of gotten attached to them 'cause my brother-in-law's a big Kansas City, uh, Chief's fan.
L:  Okay, yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] But, uh, he -- he -- he likes the Eagles okay now. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, er, it's the f- -- yeah, that's definitely my favorite sport, football.  I played a little bit in high school, so ...
R:  Yeah.  Are you in college now?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, do you like -- do you -- do you prefer like college sports --
L:  Uh, well --
R:  -- or do you like the pro stuff better?
L:  I don't know.  I guess I watch a lot of -- the NFL, like the most.  That's like, by far the closest.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I also watch like a lot of college football.  Like, if it's on, I'll watch it but I don't follow like any specific team real closely.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause I go to like a small school, so like --
R:  They don't have a team.
L:  Oh, they do but they're like, you know, double A or something --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- or a triple A --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I don't know.
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  So --
R:  -- again, it's more fun in person.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like my girlfriend has like season tickets to the Eagles game.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Like her dad's had -- oh, her dad's grandfather --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- got them --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [NOISE] so --
R:  Like years --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ago?
L:  Yeah, years ago, so --
R:  Oh, that's -- that's --
L:  They've had --
R:  -- cool.
L:  -- the tickets ever since.
R:  Yeah, my in --
L:  So, they keep --
R:  -- laws --
L:  -- you know, they keep passing them down.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah, my in laws did the same thing when the Chiefs -- I mean, it used to be in Kansas City, [LAUGH] you could just like go, "Oh, it's Sunday afternoon, let's go to the Chief's game" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know and just walk in because there was never anybody there --
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  -- and the same thing with the Royals, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah --
L:  That's how it is with the Phillies now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like you can just walk in.  It used to be like that with the Sixers.
R:  Well, now's the time to get your season tickets then. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's what they did and -- and now, I mean, you just -- you can't get in for anything.
L:  Yeah, it's even -- you know, even when the Eagles stunk all those years --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there were still kind of -- some games are still hard to get tickets for.
R:  Well, we -- we were thinking about getting them for the Bucks and they were just so miserable.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- the first year [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- and then it's like, "Oh, my God, they won the -- the --"
L:  Yeah, the --
R:  "-- the whole shebang".
L:  Yeah, they beat us, that's right. [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  I know.
L:  Yeah, we play them on opening day.
R:  Well, yeah, that's --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- true.  That's true.  Well, um, gosh, I can't think -- hm [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- um, see, what's -- well, see, I don't know a thing about hockey, um --
L:  Uh, hockey's -- hockey's a fun sport to watch.
R:  Yeah, is that getting big again?  I mean, 'cause like --
L:  You know what?  It's never -- I don't think it's ever gonna be like huge, huge.  It's big like up here and like in Canada and stuff.
R:  Right.
L:  But I --
R:  Yeah, I have a friend in Canada.  That's why I asked you where you are from and he's, uh, huge into hockey.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um --
L:  I love hockey h-.  I mean, we used to play all the time, like even in the neighborhood.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Well, like now, like, uh --
R:  You've got the weather for it.
L:  Well, we don't play ice hockey.  We just play like, you know, in the street and stuff.
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  And like, you know, er, we used to play on the tennis courts --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then they'd always chase us away 'cause we'd ruin the tennis courts.
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  So, finally, they're building, you know, hockey courts now around here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, so that's -- so it's much better and so like, yeah ...
R:  Well, that's cool.  Yeah, it seems like it's gotten, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- bigger --
L:  It has --
R:  -- than it used to be.
L:  It's fun.  It's like, you -- I mean -- and there's not that many rules to it either.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, well, maybe that's why I get confused when I watch it then, [LAUGH] 'cause --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I mean, eh, watching it on TV, I mean, I just have no idea what's going on.  I mean --
L:  Yeah, you have to have someone, I guess, explaining like the basics to you.
R:  Yeah, well, I mean, I kind of know like what they're trying to do but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's so fast and there's so many people jumbled all over and even like the video games --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's just like h- -- video hockey. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I'm like, [LAUGH] "I don't get it".
L:  You know what's actually fun too to have gone to?  We have a la crosse team up here, like a professional la crosse team.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah and that -- that's -- that's the best to go to.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's ev- -- it's even more fun than football 'cause like -- I don't know.  It's just like it's -- it's really cheap, first of all.  'Cause it's like -- it's not like one -- it's not a major sport at all.
R:  Right.
L:  It's never -- you know, it's never sold out --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and like, the crowds just fun, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, you know, people are like rowdy and cheering and you know, they play all this music while, you know, the game's going on.
R:  Well, isn't that kind of like jai alai?
L:  Um --
R:  La crosse. [NOISE]
L:  A little bit, except it's like a team game, like you're trying to score a goal.  I think jai alai's just like throwing a ball against the wall and trying to catch it.
R:  Okay.
L:  But I think it's like the same kind of like, ball and  --
R:  They use it like a basket kind of --
L:  Yeah, yeah --
R:  -- thing, right?
L:  -- yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Okay and so, what's the point in la crosse?
L:  It's like it's five on five.  It's like a combination of like hockey and you know, like soccer kind of.
R:  Okay.
L:  And I guess, basketball a little, 'cause you have like a ball and you -- you got to like -- you know, score on the other team.
R:  Right.
L:  And there's always like a huge fight every game.
R:  Right.
L:  Which is always entertaining.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, the two -- the two goalers will run out and fight each other.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So [LAUGH] ...
R:  Well, you know, yet soccer --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- actually, uh, I watch sometimes, uh, on TV.  Especially, you know, the women's cup, when they had to hold --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- back but, uh --
L:  Yeah, I watch it a little bit.  Like, I don't really understand like with the time at the end.
R:  Yeah, uh --
L:  Like [LAUGH], I mean --
R:  -- yeah, um --
L:  [LAUGH] That confuses me, so ...
R:  Yeah, I'm a little vague on the rules and -- and when I've seen it in person, it's been like kids and you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they're all pretty vague on the rules [LAUGH] too [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so, I've --
L:  Yeah, I remember --
R:  -- never learned it and --
L:  -- I played soccer for a couple of years.
R:  Yeah, did you?
L:  Yeah.  I think I played pretty much, eh, like every sport.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's not like -- like in the leagues and so on but just like in the neighborhood but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- yeah, we played everything.
R:  Yeah, well, that's kind of why I've -- I've started watching, 'cause we have a little girl and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and that's --
L:  That's nice.
R:  -- something, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- later on, we'd like to get her involved in --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so, 'cause that's something girls can do too.
L:  Yeah, yeah --
R:  So ...
L:  -- I mean, I remember in my neighborhood, it was all like -- it was pretty much all boys --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and like we would just play like, you know -- we didn't even have to go to camp.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause it's like, you could just -- we had like this camp in our neighborhood for like -- you know, we were all like about -- we were all like two or three years apart --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- at the most and like, so we --
R:  Well, yeah --
L:  -- would just play --
R:  -- I mean --
L:  -- you know, uh -- we could play just sports any time we wanted to.  We had enough --
R:  Well --
L:  -- for like --
R:  -- the same thing --
L:  -- two teams.
R:  -- yeah.  In -- in the summer when we were kids, I mean, we were out playing every -- I mean, we all had basketball --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- goals and we all had, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, we had a big cove to play in, so we'd play baseball --
L:  Yeah, yeah, we --
R:  -- out there.
L:  -- yeah, we had that too.
R:  Yeah and --
L:  Uh, one -- one of our neighbors and a pretty big backyard, so we could --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- play football there.
R:  Well, there wasn't a kind of -- there wasn't the kind of, uh, you know -- there wasn't kind of sports on TV then either.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you know, you weren't inside watching it.  You were outside [LAUGH] playing it.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  So, 'cause the -- the pro teams -- everybody -- well, I grew up in Tennessee and everybody was really into the FOLS.  You know, 'cause Tennessee didn't have a pro team.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, I mean, everybody was glued [NOISE] to their sets for those.
L:  Hm.
R:  But, um -- but yeah, I mean, the point -- it's -- it's just kind of hard for me to get into pro --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- sports 'cause it's so -- I mean, God, they just make a ridiculous amount of money --
L:  They do.
R:  -- they're not from the city they're playing for, so --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- it's kind of hard to get loyal to -- I mean --
L:  You know what --
R:  -- it's just like --
L:  -- it used to be more like, they would be in the city for their whole career, you know.
R:  Exactly, exactly and --
L:  And then they brought free agency about and like now, it's like [NOISE] -- I mean --
R:  Well, people --
L:  -- your team's never the same for more than, you know, five years or something.
R:  Exactly and people get behind like one player.  You know, people --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- have favorite [NOISE] players that -- that --
L:  Like I remember --
R:  -- stay with the team but --
L:  -- when I started watching the Eagles, it was like the Eagles defence.  Like, I knew every one on there.
R:  Yeah, right, right. [NOISE] Well, same thing with the [NOISE] Chiefs 'cause they were so bad for so long, [NOISE] nobody else would come and [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- play for them.  And they didn't go anywhere.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK] So, um, but you know, it was like, y- you knew --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- everything about [NOISE] everybody [NOISE] and they were in town and [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you saw them out and about and that kind of thing, so ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, it -- it's different now. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I still like it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I -- I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- some players sign stuff on long term +contracts -- contracts --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like our -- our -- our quarter back, uh, I don't know.  Donovan McNabb, like he just signed like a ten year deal or something.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Or --
R:  Well --
L:  -- you know, it's like [NOISE] -- or maybe -- maybe it was less.  I think it was, er -- I think it was a ten year deal for a couple -- you know, twenty seven million dollars or more -- maybe more than that.
R:  Uh, well, you know, that --
