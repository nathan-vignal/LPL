R:  Hello?
L:  H- hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  My name is Larry.
R:  Hi.  I'm Alyssa.  Um ... [PAUSE] 
L:  Bioterrorism is -- I guess is the topic.
R:  Right. [LAUGH] Um, [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] well, I guess, ah, [NOISE] [PAUSE] w- w- what was it?  What -- what could do to prev- -- prepare?  Is that what ...?
L:  Yeah.  That's --
R:  N- --
L:  -- what it sounds like.
R:  Okay.  Um, [LIPSMACK] well ... hm.  What do you think about, you know, the, um, like, vaccinations for smallpox and that kinda thing?
L:  Um, well it's -- at first I -- I was in favor of them but a -- a lot of older seem to be getting sick or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- having heart attacks and things though so --
R:  Right.
L:  Probably, it's, you know, I -- I guess it's still an individual choice but, um -- and it's probably a bit of o- over reaction.  I -- I don't -- I, you know -- I -- d- -- I don't know how many countries actually have smallpox.  I --
R:  Right.
L:  Um, maybe North Korea does.  Ah, um, but, ah, the -- but, you know, there is, ah, plenty of other things to worry about down the road I guess.  You know what I'm saying?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Eventually, people will probably be able to develop their own, um -- ab- -- e- eventually count- countries will probably be able to develop new viruses and things and we won't have vaccines.
R:  Right.
L:  So, ah, I guess, ah, the best thing to do is a lot of research and development.
R:  Right.
L:  What do you think?
R:  Well, y- you know, I agree w- with what you said about the, um, smallpox vaccine being dangerous.  But, um, or, you know, c- -- possibly dangerous.  But as far as, you know -- I don't -- like, personally, I'm not -- obviously, I know it's like a concern but I'm not that worried about it.  Um, but, [LIPSMACK] you know, basically, from what I've heard, the threat at this point, you know, isn't that great for smallpox and even, like, anthrax, you know?  I know that, ah, as far as large scale, kinda, problem it's, you know, kinda, n- not an issue.  But, you know, I know there's -- there's probably [NOISE] things that, you know, could happen but I don't -- it's not something I worry about, you know?  But, um, [NOISE] you know, I think [NOISE] [PAUSE] -- ah, sorry [inaudible].  But I think that, um, you know, [NOISE] like you said the [NOISE] research and development --
L:  I guess -- hear she doesn't care for bioterrorism either. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  And being, [NOISE] you know, I know it -- we need to be, ah, [NOISE] watching out, you know, looking out for it and it's a concern [NOISE] but I don't really know aside from smallpox and anthrax, like -- as far as, like, the [NOISE] water supply issue and that kind of thing -- I've heard that's not really a [NOISE] big concern or any- --
L:  Yeah.  The -- the main -- the, a- -- of course, the delivery of the bioterrorism element is, um, one of the big concerns.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, th- -- ah -- ah, a lot of them, you know -- unless there's a good delivery mechanism, they won't really be effective so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, they -- I -- you know, I -- I guess we need to work on things like detectors and -- and I've read about, you know, they may be able to s- -- you know, sprinkle some dust and tell whether something, you know, biochemical b- -- ah -- ah -- ah, biological agent is around.  Ah, but, ah, you know, it's a -- it's a -- and it's a very, ah, you know -- it's -- it's n- -- there's n- -- there's really not much we can do about it in the long run I guess.
R:  Right. [PAUSE] I mean, I'm not really familiar with -- with that -- what you were saying but I know that, um -- like, the, um, anthrax situation for example -- I mean, I don't know if I -- I -- I don't know if that's necessarily was even ... [NOISE] You know, it could've just been, like, some, you know, wacko person.  I don't know if it was necessarily like a -- a, um, threat as far as, like -- y- you know what I mean?  Like, a --
L:  Mm.
R:  I don't know.  I'm not really sure but I know anthrax isn't really -- from what I've heard -- a major, ah, like, concern as far as widespread type of --
L:  Well, again it's the worrying about dispersal.  You know, they have --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, ah -- you know, we have a -- you know, in the United States, we have a lot of small planes and things and, ah, you have to worry about somebody, you know, ah, perhaps of -- of, you know, foreign element interacting with them and, you know, they could fly over a city or something.  So, you know, I -- I -- I guess it -- I guess it also becomes a question of -- I'm doing some University of Penn thing [NOISE] for five dollars [LAUGH] -- but anyway, um, ah, it becomes an -- ah, you know, how much, you know, b- -- freedoms, ah, do you wanna give up to protect against it too.
R:  Well --
L:  That's another issue.
R:  Right.  You mean, like infringing on people's rights?  Y- -- 
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Like, civil rights?
L:  So, that m- -- you know, and for example, you know, maybe restricting more airplanes or having, you know, much, you know, stringent requirements to fly small airplanes and things like --
R:  D- -- right.
L:  -- that or, um, you know, ah -- you know, how much do you watch people and -- and, ah, who, you know -- maybe -- maybe there's certain ingredients that someone might buy so would you m- -- be monitoring those and --
R:  What do you mean?  Like, to make something or ...?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Right.
L:  And eventually, after something like that happens, they'll be doing that I would think.  So --
R:  Right.
L:  Ah ...
R:  Well, how do you feel about that?  I mean ...
L:  Well, you know, that's a, you know, ah -- i- i- it, you know -- you -- you really, ah -- ah, you know, well, I mean, we should put it off for as long as we can but at some point we, ah -- that's what it may come down to.
R:  Right.
L:  Um --
R:  If it ensures, like, the safety of everybody, whatever.  I mean, ah -- not that you can ever guarantee it but ...  And it depends, I guess, on what you're talking a- -- you know, as far as what -- how far you would go.  But I mean, ah, certainly some amount of, ah -- yes, s- sometimes people are g- -- there's always gonna be -- well, that feel like they're, you know -- that they're, like, kinda, being infringed upon but, you know, it c- could be necessary in some situ- -- you know, like, depending on the situation.  Obviously, d- depending on the level of threat or, you know, what -- what was going on at the time.
L:  Yeah.  An- and I guess another thing we'll have to worry about too is -- is smaller scale things.  Maybe somebody -- a restaurant worker -- poisoning food, ah, you know, ah, there -- there -- there have been things about threats to the water supply and things but that seems like it's, ah, not something -- too much to worry about because it would be dispersed too much, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, ah, yeah, that -- I guess there's, you know, the -- ah, you know, an -- an individual doing something.  Um, sort of, the biological version of, you know, a suicide bomber or something.
R:  Right.
L:  Ah --
R:  Or not necessarily even, like, a restaurant but maybe, like, in a food manufacturing --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- place or something, right?
L:  Well, we can w- -- I think they can watch that a lot more closely than they can individual restaurants because --
R:  Well, okay.  Yeah.  I guess.
L:  I mean, yeah.  I mean, well -- I -- I mean, there's still a lot of places that it can come in on the food chain too but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, you know, that -- i- if it comes in too early, the food gets processed and washed or, ah, you know, it -- but, ah --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ah, I'm sure they -- they're -- they're doing stuff about that.  Ah, you know, they're probably, you know, putting more cameras and things up in factories.
R:  Right. [PAUSE] 
L:   Okay.  Ah ... [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Um ...
L:  Trying to think what else that we could cover on bioterrorism.  Ah, um ... [PAUSE] Yeah.  I g- -- i- it is pretty scary that a lot of that stuff is, apparently, pretty easy to make and -- and such.  And, ah -- ah, you know, I guess the United States is gonna have to be more of a -- take a more policeman of the r- -- world approach too.
R:  Right.
L:  And that so, you know?  That has its consequences but, you know, somebody's gotta, ah -- ah, w- -- keep an eye on, ah, people that, ah, are wayward.  So, I guess that -- that's gonna fall on our shoulders, unfortunately.
R:  Right.
L:  'Cause nobody else is brave enough to step up and do it.  So ...
R:  Well, do you think, like, the smallpox vaccine, all the coverage of, you know -- like, the president getting it and all that -- I mean, do you think that was, kind of, l- like, you know, they know that there's so many threats that they can't even do anything about it?  It was, kinda, like, a way to show, like, okay, you know, this is something we can --
L:  Well, yeah.  I -- I -- I d- -- in the case of smallpox, I don't think they really knew what exactly Iraq had.
R:  Right.
L:  And, ah, they decided to, you know, go ahead and do that and, um, you know, the -- that, um, b- but, um ...  So, I guess that was uncertainty a- and they -- they're, you know -- they -- there was, probably, very little they could do in s- -- bioterrorism so they -- they -- they wanted th- th- -- you know, whatever they could do is, ah, you know, th- they wanted to do that.
R:  Yeah. [PAUSE] [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  The whole smallpox thing, ah, you know, ah -- you know -- you know, w- what do you do about kids and stuff?  I have three kids and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, ah, if they're, you know --
R:  Right.  I have two kids and, you know, like, I -- I don't know how old you are but for me --
