R:  Hi, I'm Josh.
L:  Hi.
R:  I'm Josh.
L:  What's your name?
R:  Josh.
L:  Josh?  I'm Ariel.  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  Do you have a favorite holiday?
R:  Um, no, not really but if I had to pick one it'd be Christmas, it'd be for my kids. [SIGH]
L:  Christmas?  I think I'd pick Halloween.
R:  Halloween?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Why's that?
L:  'Cause I like dressing up a lot.
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  And I like -- I like seeing people in costumes and I like being -- making creative costumes and people -- and I like -- yeah, I guess, and I like seeing ki- -- I like that kids go around on Halloween and they go round to people's houses and everyone's just so nice and generous and gives them candy. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, yeah, well --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- uh, reason why I like Christmas is it's something for the kids.
L:  [MN]
R:  Uh, I like to see the smile on their faces and that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Do your -- do your kids give you presents also?  Do they make you little cards and stuff for Christmas?
R:  Uh, yeah, but it's -- uh, it's almost not necessary.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But they do it anyway.
L:  Uh-huh.  How old are your kids?
R:  I got a one year old and I got an eight year old.
L:  Uh-huh.  What's the -- your favorite present you got them for Christmas?
R:  What did I get?  What was the favorite present we got them for Christmas?  Um, for the one year old it was this, uh, Fisher Price toy that makes noises and helps them stand and everything. [NOISE]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Or -- or Playschool or something, I'm not -- I'm -- [inaudible] or something.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Uh, for the eight year old [SIGH] um, uh, he got a lot of different things. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So -- so it's hard to pick out exactly what was his favorite.
L:  Oh.
R:  So --
L:  I can't remember what my favorite presents were when I was a kid but I celebrate Hanukka so --
R:  Really?
L:  So then I would get -- I'd get, like, uh, seven little presents instead of --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  It was fun 'cause I had presents every day [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but just little -- little ones instead of, like, one day with lots of big presents.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] I -- when I was younger that was maybe my favorite holiday.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But I think I've always really liked Halloween.  I lived in New York and there was a -- a big parade for Halloween where everyone's dressed up and it goes all night and it's fun.
R:  A parade for Halloween?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I -- I never knew they could do -- they did that. [NOISE]
L:  I don't think they do it in a lot of place.  I don't think almost anywhere does it but in New York they had it and --
R:  Really?
L:  Uh-huh, and -- and everyone gets dressed up and I remember that I went one year, too, and it was like, you had to get there so early to see it that I was so far away I couldn't even see the parade [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But -- but it's like in New York everyone gets dressed up for Halloween.  You take the subway and it'd just be like everyone on the subway would be in costumes.  I think it's really great 'cause everyone's out of their, like, normal, you know, daily life --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and they're -- they're, like, these different people or different animals or different whatever --
R:  Right.
L:  -- for one -- for one night, yeah, but I've -- I haven't -- this year I celebrated Christmas when I was in Mexico and that was fun --
R:  Right.
L:  -- 'cause I -- I celebrated with a friend of a friend of a friend, it was very random and everyone was dancing and -- and, um, I didn't know anyone but it was real -- it was like in the middle of the jungle.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It was really nice.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah, so that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, it was in a house.  It wasn't, like, you know, in the middle of the jungle --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but it was, like, where they lived was really beautiful.
R:  Right.
L:  And it was like -- it was weird to be -- do you live in the south or do you live in the north?
R:  [NOISE] I live in Iowa and nothing exciting happens here. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh. [LAUGH] Because in, uh -- in Mexico it was weird to be there --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and it was so warm but it was Christmas.
R:  Right.  Yeah, we have the hardest winters for Christmas here in Iowa.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  I lived in Iowa one summer, in Iowa City.
R:  Really?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  How --
L:  I studied as a -- I did, like, a summer program at University of Iowa.  Where in Iowa do you live?
R:  Uh, I live about half hour from Iowa City.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, Cedar Rapids.
L:  Oh, I -- I was never there but I had friends who lived there --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in Ce- -- in Cedar Rapids.  I was there, there was a tornado --
R:  Yeah, we always --
L:  -- when I -- when --
R:  -- have them in the su- --
L:  What?
R:  We have them in the summer. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it was in the summer and there was a big tornado.  It was like my first tornado ever but do --
R:  [MN]
L:  Although you don't have earthquakes, though, do you, in Iowa?
R:  No, no earthquakes here in Iowa.
L:  No earthquakes? [LAUGH]
R:  No, none.
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] we don't really have earthquakes here, either.  I guess there was one in -- in New York at some time --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- but, um -- so they -- one of the other questions was if you wanted to have a favorite holiday, what would it be?  If you could make up a holiday, I think it was.
R:  If I can make up a holiday?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh
L:  [MN]
R:  Gee, I don't know.  I -- I guess maybe I consider my kids' [LAUGH] birthdays a holiday --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [COUGH] -- because it'd be -- you know, it's their own special day so I guess I'd consider that a holiday.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's a good holiday.  No, but this -- I think the question was, like, if you wanted to create your own holiday 'cause that's already a --
R:  That's right.
L:  Oh, that'd be -- that's the holiday you'd create?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like everybody would celebrate it?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.  I would -- I think my holiday would be -- it'd be closing off -- like, there wouldn't be cars and all the streets could be a dance -- everyone could dance in the streets [LAUGH] kinda like --
R:  Oh, like -- [NOISE]
L:  Like block parties everywhere. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh -- oh, yeah, a block party holiday.
L:  Yeah.  Like --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- everyone would just have a block party.  You could, like, go to different block parties.
R:  Nationwide block party. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I think I'd have Block Party Holiday.  That'd be --
R:  That would be cool.
L:  Yeah, that'd be fun, I think.  But, I -- I think -- I'm trying to think.  I like birthdays a lot but I don't think I'd make my birthday a hol- -- [LAUGH] a national holiday.
R:  [MN]
L:  When I -- when -- in New York they have this really great holiday that's called, um, Brooklyn Queens Day which is a --
R:  Right.
L:  It's not anything, it's just people that live in Brooklyn or Queens, you get off from school for the day. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  To cel- -- to celebrate Brooklyn Queens Day.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  That was always one of my favorite holidays 'cause [LAUGH] I'd get off from school for no reason.
R:  [NOISE] Wow.
L:  And, like, people that lived nearby were, like, in the other boroughs they wouldn't get off  'cause they weren't part of Brooklyn Queens Day.
R:  Oh --
L:  So ...
R:  -- we should have something like that around here. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah [LAUGH] Cedar Rapids Day and then -- yeah --
R:  Yeah, that'd be -- yeah, that'd be a cool -- cool holiday, just a day where everybody -- everybody shuts everything down, everybody don't work, whatever.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's just a lazy day.
L:  Yeah, I like --
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, I liked when I was a senior at high school --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we had senior cut day which was like the day all the seniors don't go to school. [LAUGH] That was a fun day.
R:  Oh.
L:  I went to the beach.
R:  Oh.
L:  That was nice.  I guess in Iowa you can't go to the beach, though. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, we had like a [NOISE] -- when I was seniors we had like a [NOISE] seniors skip day.
L:  Uh-huh, yeah, those are --
R:  We didn't really -- really didn't do anything, though. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  But I -- but it -- it was funny 'cause my year actually people decided --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that we needed two senior skip days.  So we had two, [LAUGH] like two weeks in a row we had for that Friday was senior skip day.  So I remember one time I just didn't do much and the next week I went to the beach and I remember it was really cold and no one would go swimming and I went swimming. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I bet you regretted that part.  Did you end up with a cold doing something like that?
L:  No.  I have one right now [LAUGH] but at the time I didn't end up with a cold.  I like swimming in cold water.
R:  Yikes, not me.
L:  [LAUGH] No?
R:  No, no.  Um, I guess -- I guess, I'm so used to the cold but I do not -- but I hate cold baths, cold showers, I hate even going -- when I go to the -- we have, like, little parks that have so called little beaches, I hate going in the water right away because it's cold. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I was just -- I was just, um, biking up this hill to my house and I was hoping that there -- there's a fountain at the top of it, we have this cold fountain, like, for kids to play in --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it used to be -- it's -- in the summer it's on twenty four hours a day and I was hoping it'd be on so I could go [LAUGH] in it 'cause I was so hot.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's -- today's like one of the first days that it was hot and -- and I live in Pittsburgh now but it's been really cold.  Has it been cold in Iowa?
R:  Oh, it's been kinda hot lately.  It's like eighty something degrees today.
L:  Oh really?  Wow, that's hot.  Yeah, it hasn't been -- it's like -- it -- it just came all of a sudden.  It was cold and then one day it was hot and that's it. [LAUGH] I don't know if it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know if it's going to go back to cold or if it's just going to stay at hot.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But ...
R:  I ended up taking my kids to the park today and had them play in the water --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- except the one year old wouldn't go towards the water pad.  It's like a water [NOISE] -- it's like a water playground.  They have water squirting all over and everything else like that.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And the one year -- my one year old, he wouldn't even go near it.
L:  Oh, he didn't like the water.
R:  No, he -- everytime he got spr- -- sprayed just a tiny bit he just ran right back to us. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, oh.
R:  He didn't care too -- care too much for it.
L:  Uh-huh.  I think another holiday I would like is everyone playing music.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I think this would go with the block party but there could be music everywhere outside.  I just went -- they just had a free concert downtown and I just went to it, it was really fun.  It was like -- there was -- it was -- uh, um, in Pittsburgh there's this park that's like -- has a fountain and it's at the point of three rivers and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that was where the concert was and it was really fun.  There were lots of people and it's pretty.  I think I would have lots of free concerts on Block Party Day. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Hey, you say you're from Pittsburgh?
L:  No, I'm from New York but I live in Pittsburgh.
R:  Oh, from New York?  Oh, oh, right.
L:  I live in Pittsburgh now.
R:  Oh, you were --
L:  Have you met --
R:  I have relatives that live in Pennsylvania somewhere.
L:  Oh, really?  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Probably not Pittsburgh.  Maybe Pittsburgh.
R:  Yeah, may -- maybe.  I think -- I think it was on my grandmother's side.
L:  Oh, uh-huh.  Does the rest of --
R:  Uh --
L:  Does the rest of your family live in Iowa?
R:  Uh, yeah, yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  See my, uh, grandmother she -- when she was younger, she used to work for the Pentagon and, uh, my grandfather he was originally from Iowa and he was in the service and he met her over -- over there, you know, in DC, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and they ended up together and everything else. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh, and then they moved to Iowa?
R:  Now he's originally from Iowa.
L:  Oh, he was from Iowa?  Okay.
R:  He -- my -- my grandfather was, yeah.
L:  Oh, uh-huh.  'Cause then she moved to Iowa to live with him?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.  I liked Iowa City when I was there.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I remember that there was corn growing into the gas station and I thought that was funny.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, it's just an everyday thing where I see that all the time so it doesn't even bother me. [LAUGH]
L:  I know, you probably don't think about it. [LAUGH]
R:  No.
L:  But it -- yeah, it was -- it was nice and I really did like that tornado 'cause I'd never been in one.  When I was -- I was just --
