L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.  
L:  Hi there.  I'm Kathy from Wisconsin.
R:  Hi.  I'm Derra from Alabama.
L:  Oh, okay.  Um, I don't watch a lot of sports.  I don't know about you?
R:  No.  I really um -- have never been a big sports fan.
L:  Me either.  Uh, although my husband and my son are getting into it pretty much, so --
R:  Well, I have three little boys, so my oldest little boy is seven so I --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I figure it'll be -- won't be too long before we're uh being sports fanatics.
L:  Right.  Yeah.  My son is eight and a half and I'd say within -- within the past year or so, he's really gotten into watching the Green Bay Packers and the basketball.  Um, I don't know, he just -- he really gets into that.  My husband watches golf.  Which I think is so boring.
R:  Yes.  I -- I have to um --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- agree.  I have my aunt and uncle, they're retired, and they both play golf and they take -- took me golfing one time --
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  -- and I was like, this is the most boring sport --
L:  [LAUGH].  I know.  That's how I feel.
R:  -- to go to, to play, to watch, anything.  So [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  It's very boring.  I don't understand why anyone would want to try to get a little ball into a little hole.  [LAUGH].
R:  That's it.  Uh -- uh, now we've started getting a little bit more into baseball.
L:  Okay.
R:  My boys play tee ball and peanuts this year, so they're getting a little bit more interested in that, but --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- but we haven't -- and I'm actually learning all the rules and regulations by pl- being a mom, so watching them --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so I can sit there and -- and sort of watch a game, and do a little bit, you know --
L:  Right.  Okay.  Good.
R:  -- of that.  
L:  Sure, sweetie.  Okay.
R:  [NOISE].
L:  Well, I'm not sure what else they really want us to --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- to -- to talk about.
R:  To say.
L:  Okay.  Um --
R:  [NOISE].
L:  -- are you from Refunding[?] by any chance?
R:  Yes.  Yes.
L:  Oh, you are?
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay.  Do -- can we change the subject here?  Will we still get paid?  
R:  I -- I guess --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I hope so.  [LAUGH].
L:  Um, do you go online?
R:  Yes.  I do.
L:  Okay.  Do you post a lot?
R:  I did -- have not posted a lot.  I sit there and -- and I read.  I'm like one of those --
L:  [NOISE].
R:  -- just look in there and read and -- and uh get all the -- get information and that and --
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  And I been trying to convert my family into couponing and -- and refunding --
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  -- and I haven't gotten into as much refunding as I'd like to.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um I -- I have five children, I'm a single mom, so --
L:  Oh, wow.  Oh.
R:  So --
L:  Okay.  
R:  [LAUGH] so my time -- but I do coupons and we started doing rebates again uh just recently I started doing all the Walgreen ones that they keep uh --
L:  Oh, good.
R:  -- posting all the good stuff on there.
L:  Yeah.  Isn't it amazing what they -- what they post?
R:  It is.  I -- I -- I -- well, I got in on the poll up deal and that was just --
L:  Oh, good.
R:  -- ecstatic.
L:  Oh, great.  Yeah, I don't have any that age any more, but actually, I don't know if you've been reading over the past few days, I'm the Kathy from Wisconsin that won in the [inaudible].
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So yeah.  So I won the -- the free trip to Universal Studios, but of course, like my husband says, it's -- it's not gonna be free at all.
R:  Of course.  You know, they always [NOISE] how did you -- I mean, I had played that game.  How many --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- times did you play to --
L:  Well, to be totally honest, let me think.  I -- I know one day I -- I put in a whole bunch of codes and never finished Michelle's list, so about two days later, I went back and the second code I put in which was Sunday, Father's Day, um I put in the code and the second code I put in and I couldn't believe it.
R:  Oh, my --
L:  I really wanted to win the um -- the [inaudible] [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  But you know -- so anyway, this free trip is gonna end up costing us something 'cause, you know, we're a family of five. 
R:  Yes. 
L:  So -- but yeah, so that was pretty cool.  
R:  See, and -- and -- and I -- I always --
L:  So --
R:  -- watch everybody say -- say they win, I'm like, "Okay, I go to all these different ones", and --
L:  [MN].
R:  -- the most I ever win is, like, the candy bars from the M&M thing and --
L:  Yeah.  Yep.
R:  -- that's -- that's my -- I said, "But I'll keep on trying" 'cause I get on there, you know, late at night when the kids --
L:  Okay.  
R:  -- can't sleep and -- and -- or I can't sleep and I'll be sitting there just playing and go -- and I'll do anything.  I used to chat online and I'm like, got out of that.  I said, "We do the couponing and the refunding because --" 
L:  Right.  You gotta do something that you can make some money out, huh?
R:  That's it.
L:  Or at least save some money at.
R:  Now if I could just find some men to refer to -- for this Fisher study 'cause I've seen on there where if you --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- refer them, you get like a five dollar bonus per --
L:  Right.
R:  And I'm like, goodness, I need to find some men to uh --
L:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.  Well, I know my husband wouldn't even be bothered with this.  You know, he's busy and I don't blame him.
R:  Well --
L:  But I know they're --
R:  Yes.
L:  They're find -- trying to find people, but yeah.
R:  Well, it's interesting.  I mean, hey, ten minutes and get paid ten dollars.  That's -- you know, that to me alone is worth it.
L:  Yeah, right.  Yep.  Here, do you want to put this in for me, my dear?  I'm making her macaroni and cheese while I'm doing this.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Here you go.  Oh, right.  So how old are your other kids, then?
R:  I have an eight year old, um, seven, five, almost two and a four month old.
L:  Oh, my gosh.  
R:  Yes.
L:  Wow.  
R:  Now, what part of Wisconsin are you from?
L:  Um, we're actually -- I'm in -- uh, I'm in Milwaukee.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  So -- yeah.
R:  Um, my uh aunt and uncle -- my -- my family, my mother was born in um Wisconsin.  I don't remember --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- what part of -- but she lived in um Northern Illinois but I had uh -- my cousins and that lived in Jamesville.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Wisconsin.  So --
L:  That's a ways from here, but okay.  Wow.
R:  And uh they lived uh -- trying to think --
L:  It's hot.
R:  We're close -- my grandparents were close to [inaudible] Iowa, so --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- right there in that corner.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And that, so --
L:  Wow.  
R:  Yeah, I love the accent.  I don't -- I don't get to go to visit as much as I uh used to, so when I hear somebody from up north, it's like, "Oh, I love it".
L:  Uh-huh.  Well, we actually have some neighbors who just -- uh, went to Alabama over -- I think I was -- it had to be over uh spring break, um, to visit some relatives, so --
R:  Oh, it's definitely -- uh, you know, it's neat how many --
L:  No.
R:  -- people can be met --
L:  It's hot.  Yeah.  
R:  -- over all -- you know, like through Michelle's website and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that.  It's interesting just how many people.  Some -- my sister in law was telling me the other day, she's like "Nobody coupons any more".  I said, "Yes, they do, Kim".
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  "You just --"  I said, "Let me show you where".
L:  Yeah.
R:  "Where to find all these people".  I said, "There really is".
L:  Yeah.  
R:  She's  --
L:  There is.
R:  -- like, "There're people give such a hassle", I said, "Yeah, but you just gotta stick your ground" because --
L:  That's true.  You do.  
R:  [NOISE].  And that.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Too.  [NOISE].  And I don't mean -- I enjoy it.  I love going and getting -- uh, got in on that Adville deal that they had at Walgreen's --
L:  Oh, good.  Okay.  
R:  And the people are giving -- having such a hard time, they couldn't figure out because I bought something extra over it so I wouldn't have to --
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  -- and it still ended up -- I -- I can't remember what all I got, but it ended up only costing thirty two cents altogether, so --
L:  Oh, my gosh.  Cool.
R:  -- I was in there going, okay, I'm gonna have to take a picture here.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I've never been one to do it and I said, "I'm going to do this".  I'm going to take a picture of all my poll up --
L:  Oh, good.
R:  -- all the Taco Bells that -- the shells that I got --
L:  Oh, great.  Send it to Michelle, huh?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, right.  
R:  And that.
L:  Good.  
R:  And that, I have to tell people all the time, I'm like, "Look what I got?  Look what I got?"
L:  Mhm.  Yep.  I know.  It's exciting, but you know what?  Most people just can't understand.  They just can't.  [LAUGH].
R:  No, they can't.  I mean, and I'm sitting here, going [MN] free or next to free.  I said I have not bought toothpaste in I don't know how long because I get it for free.
L:  Wow.
R:  And -- and they just don't get it.  I said, "You'll get it one day".  If you have as many kids as I do and you live off --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- of one income --
L:  Yeah, that's very difficult.  So obviously you work, then?
R:  I do.  In home day care.  I'm a licensed --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- childcare provider, so --
L:  So you've really got a houseful then?
R:  Oh, yes.  Always.  And --
L:  How many kids do you watch?
R:  Um, I'm able to keep six, but I'm working towards getting an assistant, to go up to twelve.
L:  Oh.  Wow.  Excellent.  [NOISE].  Okay.
R:  So I'm hoping --
L:  Just let it cool.
R:  -- to --
L:  Oh, that's excellent.  Good luck to you.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I have an ex who doesn't feel that he should pay child support 'cause he remarried and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- has children with his wife and stepchildren --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- and he's just can't afford us all and I'm like --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- okay, well, don't ask to bother me, then.  We'll make it.
L:  Well, good for you.  You've got a great attitude.  That's really nice.  
R:  Uh, well it look a long time of -- of getting that good attitude.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Oh, I'm sure it did.  Yeah.  
R:  And uh -- but I have a great family, so --
L:  Oh, that's --
R:  -- that --
L:  Yeah, that helps.  
R:  [NOISE].  
L:  Wow.  Well, excellent.
R:  [NOISE].  So how --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- long have you been doing the uh couponing and refunding?
L:  Oh, I've probably been doing it about, um, about four years now.  And I don't know --
R:  [NOISE].
L:  -- do you do any of those reward [inaudible]?
R:  I have tried, um, a couple.  I don't have a credit card so my biggest uh -- I have bad credit.
L:  Oh.
R:  It's my ex husband.  You know?
L:  Oh.
R:  Sign my name right along with his, we were real young when we got married and --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [NOISE] and -- and that.  So I don't get to do the -- now, I did get on -- in on the crashed[?] box deal.
L:  Oh.
R:  I had my sister -- I said, okay, I'll pay you for to get --
L:  Yeah, that was --
R:  -- get offline and get me one.
L:  That was a great deal.  That was so cool.
R:  I'm hoping to -- I -- she's called me yesterday and said that they said that they shipped it out Friday, so I'm --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- yet to receive it, so I'm hoping --
L:  Great.
R:  I'm excited.  I'm, like, oh the kids are gonna be so excited.
L:  Oh, yeah.  It was -- it was neat.  My kids had a blast with it, too.  
R:  Well, how quickly did you get it from --
L:  I actually got mine within a couple days, but see, I was probably one of the very first ones to --
R:  First?
L:  -- get in on it.  Yeah.  'Cause I -- you know, it was -- been a few -- well, it's been at least two -- two and a half weeks already for me, that I've had it, so --
R:  Right.  I got it on the second deal.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  The second time, so --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And that.  'Cause I was like, when I first got on there, I had been off the internet for a couple of days, and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- then I got there and I saw all these four ninety nine cracked boxes.  I'm like, what are they talking about?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And then realized how much and I'm like, oh, I want in on this.  
L:  Yeah.  For sure.  [LAUGH].
R:  And that.  Yes, yeah, you know?
L:  Yep.  That's why you can't be off the internet.  [LAUGH].
R:  I know.  I said it -- that's mine.  I said I have to stay on it more often.
L:  Yeah.  That's right.
R:  Now, do you get to do -- uh, do -- do you stay pretty organized for all the refunding and --
L:  Yes.  I'm very organized, which really helps.  So -- 
R:  Oh --
