L:  [NOISE] Hi, my name is Amanda.
R:  Hi Amanda.  This is Linda.
L:  Hi.
R:  [MN] Hi, um --
L:  Where do you live?
R:  Ah, I'm in Texas.
L:  Ah, I'm in North Carolina.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Um, I believe our talk -- topic is, what, bio terrorism?
L:  Yep.
R:  Okay, and what we think that the government can do to, ah, eliminate it or to protect us.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- actually, I think they need to, um, protect our borders a little bit better than they have been.
L:  Oh.
R:  Ah, I live close to Mexico and, I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- mean, the people are just flooding over here.
L:  Yeah, but you know, I don't think it's as much a threat from them as the other countries that is easy for them to get to Mexico and come in to this country.
R:  Well, that's the thing, like they were able to get to Canada and come over here --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- well, if it's so easy for everybody to, ah, migrate over here from Mexico, that would be something that -- that'd be another avenue for them to use.
L:  Yeah, that's the problem.
R:  And -- yeah, and I really think that we would be stricter as far as letting so many people into our country right now.  I -- I think we --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think it's, ah, an open book, I think that, um, anybody who wants to come here has -- i- it's easy for them to do that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and we need to make it a little tougher.
L:  Yeah.  It -- they -- they need to have more, ah, backgrounds on them I think, you know.
R:  [NOISE] Yes, uh-huh, I -- I -- I know --
L:  Inf- -- background information I mean, of who their family is and things like that because I think that that has a lot to do with it also as to probably like background political --
R:  Right.  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- you know.  Like if some of these people from over in wherever, I don't know, where was it, like Afghanistan and Iraq and everything --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- had -- if they had known, like, what their families' background and politics is, normally the children take the parents' politics.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, they don't really normally go off on something different.
R:  Well, and that's true, so I -- I really do think, ah, you're right, I think they need to do a better background check, but I also --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- think a -- a lot of the government workers here in the US --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they are so inundated with paperwork, and that's all they do is shuffle paperwork, and I think they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- really need to start from within.  They need to close everything up until they come up with a really good plan on how they --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- can, you know, they can scrutinize the people coming into this country, but right now I just think --
L:  Yeah, because it's not -- it's -- it's so much paperwork that they have to go through that they're not getting anything done.
R:  That's right, and things are falling through the cracks.
L:  And it's not just on immigration, it's everything else.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, I -- I agree with you there, I -- actually, that's what I was thinking of too, even things for -- for the Americans, if you want --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- anything done and you have to deal with the government, it takes forever.
L:  Oh, I know, if you want, ah, Medicare, Medicaid, if -- everything that you have to go through, you have to file things and go through things and wait for an appointment and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- then you have to just, oh my goodness, wait in line all day once you do have an appointment --
R:  Mhm.  And --
L:  -- for everything.
R:  -- and, you know, I -- I -- and I really think that no matter what we do, I think we should still always do something, but no matter what we do, if somebody has it in their mind that they're going to do something against the United States, they're going to find a way to do it --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- um, but I still think that, um --
L:  We need to make it harder for them to find that way.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I agree.  Yeah.
R:  Because these people don't care if they die and that's scary.  So, that, you know, doesn't leave you a lot of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- options, I mean they're willing to risk their own lives --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, ah, so, you know, we -- we can't even scare them with, ah, the fact that if -- if you are caught here in the US that you could be put to death.  Well, they couldn't care less.
L:  Yeah, they don't care, because they think it's for the better of man- -- of their own cause.
R:  Mhm.  Right, whatever that may be.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Their own country or cause, or whatever, you know, whatever they want, whatever --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they're promoting.
R:  Well, you --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- know, they were tout- touting religious beliefs.  Well, I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- can't imagine that there would be a religion that would, um, want you to kill other people.
L:  I -- I can't -- I could never imagine that, you know, god would want us to kill our own brothers, because in a way, you know, if we go back to the beginning, we're all related --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- even though we're like several [LAUGH] --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- generations --
R:  But we're different.  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I don't know, you know, how many [LAUGH] m- millions of generations away from each other, but, you know, in a way we're all related.
R:  That's right.
L:  You know, if you go on back to the beginning, so why would, you know, we want to kill our brothers, sisters, family members, you know, i- if I think, ah, the -- the greatest thing in the world would be for there to b- -- there to be absolutely no borders, you know --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- just everyone living can go freely anywhere and have the same systems and institutions or anything, you know, the same equality everywhere.
R:  Oh, that would be ideally if --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that could ever, ever happen.
L:  You know, if that could ever happen.  But, because it can't, you know, we have to go through all these --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- borders and everything trying to keep people that have their different --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, causes, religions, political beliefs that a-, you know, are just totally --
R:  Well, you know what -- 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- what bothers me is, okay, we knew who -- who did the twin towers, I mean, a- and we were after him --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- then all of a sudden we put all of our focus on Iraq and Saddam Hussein --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- and we stopped --
L:  -- and what happened to this other guy?
R:  Yeah, we stopped.  And um, I -- I hope that there are things going on that we don't know about, but it just seems like they've just kind of dropped all that and focused on Iraq, where I -- I really, truly believe they still need to be focusing and get this man.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, that's something else I -- I've -- I was saying, um, th- the republicans, when, I guess -- ah, not just the republicans, but, ah, like, um, George Bush senior, he was after Iraq and when he left the presidency --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- then the war ended and all this and that peace and, ah, you know, everything that happened, it was, I mean, obviously I was young when that happened, but still, you know, I remember more or less in history lessons, and then now his son has come into presidency and it just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- seems to me that the timing on all of this was, ah, you know, of the war and th- their focus going away from Afghanistan and going onto Iraq was right when he came into presidency --
R:  Mhm, like he wanted --
L:  -- was kind of like --
R:  -- to clean up what his father left [NOISE] undone, mhm.
L:  Yeah, he wanted to go ahead and continue and finish what his father was doing.
R:  That's right.  That's what a lot of people thought.
L:  Well, it's like he doesn't care what Afghanistan and everything could be doing to us, he just wants to go and retaliate for what happened to his father.
R:  Yeah, and it just seemed like the timing for that was just bad --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, um, I -- they -- I think that a lot of people did question that, yeah.
L:  You know, and I've -- I was actually talking about that with a friend at work today and all of a sudden it came on the news, something about some people think that, you know, George W Bush is just taking over what his father started and we were, like, well there you go.
R:  Well, they're --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- saying now that they haven't found any of this, ah, ah, m- -- these hidden bombs and -- and, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [NOISE] all this stuff that S- Saddam Hussein was supposed to have had --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and they think that that was just a -- fabricated.
L:  Oh, my.
R:  Is that your children.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I -- m- -- I have a two and a half month old --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- here that's crying, [LAUGH] yeah.
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, and, I can't -- I don't understand how, if security is supposed to be so good in this country, how is it that people are bringing these bombs in --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- how is it that, I mean, obviously, you know, they can bring it in their shoe, they can bring it i- in -- they can -- in anything, but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- things need to be -- you know, if there's something that's suspicious, especially from these other countries, that are already suspicious, they need to check it out thoroughly, you know, take a gift clock apart [LAUGH] --
R:  Well, yeah.
L:  -- make a person take off their shoe and x-ray it [LAUGH], um, hm.
R:  Well, they -- you know, I don't know if you've gone through the airports, but actually, they've had me take my shoes off.  [LAUGH]
L:  Did they?
R:  Yes.
L:  No, see, I haven't gone through the airport lately.  I -- I work in security at a -- at a theme park at Carolands[?] here in Charlotte, North Carolina --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and I just recently started it and, you know what, I've had people tell me that we check their bags better than at the airport --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- which is scary because all we do, they go through a metal detector, if we see the lights, there's some lights on the side of the metal detector, if they go off at the bottom we assume it's their shoes and let them come on through.
R:  Oh.
L:  If it goes off around their waistline, you know, we will ask them, you know, can you please check and make sure you've taken everything out of your pockets, you know, this and that and, um, ah, just, and, you know, we check their bags, we'll open every pocket and look in, you know, any pocket knives, nail clippers that have a little file on it, files, stuff like that, we take away.  And for someone to tell me, and I -- it's not just one person, and I've only worked there a week now, but I've had at least ten people this week tell me that I'm checking their bags better than when they've gone to the airport.
R:  Oh, wow, see now that's scary, so --
L:  You know, and that scares me --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, because here, anyone can come through the airport.  I mean, anyone can come to a theme park also, but most people tr- --
