R:  [NOISE] How --
L:  Hello, I'm --
R:  -- ya doing?
L:  -- Tr- --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I'm sorry, I'm --
R:  Hi.
L:  -- Trudy. [LAUGH]
R:  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.
L:  I'm Trudy Orzio[?].
R:  Okay.  I'm Man[?] Veer[?]. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, uh, where are you from?
R:  I'm, uh, from, uh, Fresno, California.
L:  I'm in Tacoma, Washington.
R:  Okay.  Uh, I'm sorry, I didn't catch all the, uh, proposed topic for today.  I got 'bout bio terrorism.
L:  Right.  Something --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- how can --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- America --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- prevent it?
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, I'm not really sure [NOISE] how they can prevent it.  Wh- what do you think?
R:  Right.  I think there's a -- a great number precaution.  I think that [NOISE], uh, pretty much the obvious ones that are being taken care of, like, uh, bio -- like the -- even the UN, like the weapons inspectors and stuff.  I think they're going -- they're delving pretty deep and like, uh, the major threats in the world, I think that's what we --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- have to worry about and that's what we'd have to look for first, uh, for, uh, to control bio terrorism, like to go into Iraq and countries that we're sus- susceptible from, uh, like war and stuff, that might try to retaliate to the -- to America.  So, I think by doing that, the right precautions are being taken and, uh, that's what comes in mind immediately -- I don't know -- more indepth than that but --
L:  Well --
R:  -- I don't --
L:  -- I'm --
R:  -- know which --
L:  -- thinking, um, [NOISE] in -- on the national f- -- um, er, field, [NOISE] you know, uh, how they can prevent, uh, I suppose, different, um, chemicals from being, um -- you know, having more, um -- I'm thinking of bio terrorism in America, of how --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- they would be able to -- my husband's in a trucking industry.
R:  All right.
L:  You know and, uh, so, there's a lot of, uh, transporting of different things and -- but --
R:  [LIPSMACK] I see.
L:  -- it's just -- so much comes to mind, as how they c- -- how it could, um -- it could happen.  I mean, there's different levels of bio terrorism, wouldn't you agree?
R:  Right, exactly.  Like, uh -- I remember we experienced, er, uh, like a -- there was a lot of threat earlier with -- well, with it being transmitted through like the postal s- -- postal mail and stuff and, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we had like some machines that were used, uh, to pick up that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But yeah, definitely through like the trucks and stuff, I can understand that.  That's a big -- big, uh -- could be a big problem too.
L:  [LIPSMACK] I know they were talking about, um, that the, uh, mm, the terrorists --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- originally were getting tr- -- uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- truck, uh -- [NOISE] truck licensing --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- commercial truck --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- licensing --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and also, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they were getting, uh -- uh, [NOISE] their [NOISE] commercial, uh -- well, actually, um, [LIPSMACK] airplane licensing.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Li- like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- flying --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Right.
L:  -- licenses, you know, to be able to -- and it did amaze me that they were, um, even -- even back then, um, aware of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- those things and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- had been [NOISE], um, taking precaution towards that.  Because I mean, if they --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if they did, um, get a hold of a plane --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to be able to [NOISE] take it, um, and, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [NOISE] you know, spray our crops with, um -- with any kind of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- chemical, that would --
R:  Right.
L:  -- be just, er, tremendous -- tremendous, um, where -- I don't know how --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- how --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- susceptible we are to that.  I mean, if -- if that's s- something that --
R:  Yeah, it seems like it'd --
L:  -- that would be that --
R:  -- possible --
L:  -- easy for them --
R:  -- for that.
L:  -- to do or not.  I mean, they didn't get away with it originally, so I'm thinking, maybe it's not, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so easy for them to do.
R:  I remember, yeah, we did have that threat here in California, 'cause a while back --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of course, especially in central California where I live, um, they were definitely --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, talking about that, how big of a threat that was.  To worry about our crops getting sprayed with, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like s- anything could, you know -- could affect it and, uh, also I -- I remember, when, uh, the whole anthrax scare was happening, they were saying how somebody could even, uh, walk around or drive around town in a -- like a pick up bed and have -- have a -- you know, even a small amount of an- anthrax in the bed and it would just contaminate an entire town, like very quickly.  So --
L:  Really?
R:  -- it was -- yeah, it's a really big threat --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but -- and, um, when you come --
L:  Now, was anthrax --
R:  -- to think of it now, um --
L:  -- is anthrax, um -- I'm not really even sure what it is.  It's a respiratory, uh, problem, isn't it?  
R:  Right.
L:  Is it, um --
R:  It affects your breathing --
L:  -- contagious?
R:  -- and lungs.  What's that?  Um --
L:  Is --
R:  -- I'm not -- I'm not that familiar with it either but I -- I'm assuming it -- that it can affect people to different degrees.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  I'm assu- --
L:  Well, the --
R:  -- um --
L:  -- thing that -- the thing [NOISE] that scares me the [NOISE] most is, um, that they would [NOISE] take --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- small pox --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is it small pox? [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  And be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- able to get that, um -- because I [NOISE] -- I heard that it wasn't that hard for them --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to get.  I'm -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- maybe, I'm [NOISE] mistaken but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a virus like that, that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that wiped out [NOISE], you know, a [NOISE] lot of --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the population back when and it's been totally --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, annihilated.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  But they still have --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Availa- --
R:  I understand --
L:  -- you know, they still --
R:  -- they could probably --
L:  -- have it.
R:  -- get -- they get probably get a hold of it because -- I mean, they've gotten a hold of it and you know, they've bordered a seven forty seven jet, so [NOISE] I'm sure terrorists could find it if they really need to but --
L:  Yeah and I don't know why they still even have it.  Uh, why the -- why they don't just [NOISE] destroy it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, so that --
R:  I mean, I'm sure --
L:  -- we aren't --
R:  -- I'm sure they've researched it and they have like the vacc- --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, vaccinations for it already but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, they probably have -- they maybe have some, uh, ulterior motives for keeping those on hand.
L:  I have --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- no idea but I tell ya, it really does scare [LAUGH] me. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it is pretty scary actually.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But yeah.  
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  [LIPSMACK] Uh --
L:  So --
R:  -- up in Washington, did you guys have, uh, like any -- any anthrax, like scares?  Big -- big ones, or ...?
L:  Not that I know --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- of.  No, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we've had a lot of [NOISE], uh, [NOISE] calls, you know, like, uh [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- people getting strange --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- strange mailings --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- with -- with powder --
R:  Oh, is that right?
L:  -- but then --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it -- when it was tested, it was table salt or something else like that.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, it's like [NOISE] -- haven't had --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- had any of it specifically --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's still pretty --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- scary when -- when you think that -- that it could've been.  You know and -- and I don't know if they --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they've caught the people who were, um, doing, um, it.  It should be a felony for --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- them even to do that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- because that's --
R:  Yeah, it is --
L:  -- terrorism, just even if they don't --
R:  I remember --
L:  -- have it.
R:  -- back when that was happening, uh, there -- it was on the news that, uh, a man sent his [NOISE] friend a mailing with, uh -- he put some -- I don't know -- some kind of whi- white powder in there, resembling anthrax --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, uh, he was actually sentenced, I think, to jail time, or a fine or something.  It was pretty serious.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I don't know what they --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- would do with --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the people who actually sent anthrax but I sure hope they got caught. [NOISE]
L:  [LIPSMACK] So, how did they --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- get a hold of the anthrax?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, [NOISE] I want to say [NOISE] -- um, actually, I'm -- I really don't know but, uh, think of it like [NOISE], how the terrorists, they -- they had people in like the pilot industry and you know and like you said, in the trucking industry.  I'm sure they have like people in all kind of like, in m- -- in medical industries, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [NOISE] I'm -- I don't know.  Maybe that's like a possible way they got a hold of it, through, you know, s -- [NOISE] if they had --
L:  'Cause if they could get --
R:  -- actions or --
L:  -- a hold of that --
R:  -- something.
L:  -- you would think that they could --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- get a hold of a lot of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- other things.
R:  [NOISE] Exactly, yeah.
L:  We d- -- we do, by the way, have, um, a lot of, um -- of our, uh, agriculture here too --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in the -- in western Washington, er, not -- I mean, in --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- eastern Washington --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- not in western Washington
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- w- the apples, um, come --
R:  Oh, right.
L:  -- from -- yeah, we have a lot of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- apples --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and -- and other things, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [NOISE] in [NOISE] eastern Washington --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that's the main -- main deal [NOISE] on that side of the mountain.
R:  Okay.
L:  We have Seattle here and Boeing --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and -- and a bunch of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- stuff but they have a lot --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- of -- a lot of, uh, agriculture in, uh, eastern Washington, so --
R:  [LIPSMACK] I see.
L:  -- it's pretty scary [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- to think of that.
R:  -- definitely.
L:  You know and there's just other --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ways too.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, if they got it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in the water supply, I would -- in fact, um [NOISE], uh, we've had some --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- really strange, um smells --
R:  [NOISE] Oh --
L:  We --
R:  -- is that right?
L:  -- we live -- we live on --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a, um, flight path.
R:  Ooh.
L:  And you know, your mind goes [LAUGH] ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  When [LAUGH] you got this smell, I'm going, "What is --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- that smell --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- they've dr- -- have they dropped something on us" you know, just --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You never [LAUGH] know. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] I know --
R:  Well, what does it --
L:  -- I'm paranoid.
R:  -- normally turn out to be? [NOISE]
L:  A crack house. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Probably a crack house, yeah.
R:  I see.
L:  'Cause you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- get that -- you've got that mediciny --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- smell --
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  -- as someone was telling me, "You probably were smelling --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- a crack house, um --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- in the neighborhood.  You should report it". [LAUGH]
R:  Sh- shoo. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Not that I live --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in a terrible part of the n- -- you know, of Tacoma but you know, we're not a lar- --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we're not as large as a -- well, Fresno's not that large though either --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is it?
R:  R- no, it's, uh -- it's -- uh, it's steadily growing, um, re- -- like in the last two years, it's grown tremendously, I think.  Like, uh --
L:  Where -- where --
R:  -- just today --
L:  -- exactly is Fresno?  Is it -- is it -- it's, um, north --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of -- of LA --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- right?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Right.  It's, about the halfway point between San Francisco and LA.
L:  That's what I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- thought and you're, um -- but you're, uh, towards the ocean, so you're like, um, west --
R:  We're about, yeah --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- if you -- if you drive about an hour s- directly west, you'd probably hit the ocean. [NOISE]
L:  Okay.  'Cause like we've --
R:  So --
L:  -- gone to Placer- um -- not Placerville --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Paso Robles --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- area.
R:  Okay, yeah, that's very close to here.
L:  Okay, so, that's pretty sparse.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  As far as --
R:  Yeah, we're -- we're the big city, like in central California, so --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- but you -- it's nothing compared to LA but it's pretty big.
L:  Right.
R:  I think we have a population about, uh, six hundred thousand.
L:  Okay.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, you're pretty --
R:  Yeah, it's among -- I think it's among the top ten largest cities in California.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, 'cause I've heard of Fresno. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  Never heard of Paso Robles --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- before. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah --
L:  It's -- well, Tacoma --
R:  -- and it --
L:  -- and -- Tacoma and, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Seattle --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and now Everett, which wasn't a --
