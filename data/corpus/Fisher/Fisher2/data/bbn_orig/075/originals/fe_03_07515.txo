L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.  Hello.  My name is Ali.  I'm calling from, ah, south of Washington. [NOISE] 
L:  Ah, I'm Sawinja[?].  I'm, ah, in Rhode Island.
R:  Rhode Island?  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] That's -- that's a -- a -- very far away.  Um --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I- it's a difficult question isn't it?
L:  Yes.  Yes.  I was, you know, just thinking when I heard it off the top of my head that I --
R:  M- --
L:  -- I don't think that there's anything one can do.
R:  Me too. [LAUGH] Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] [several inaudible words].
R:  [LAUGH] Good thing that was, ah -- that was the conversation[?]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I -- um, maybe in the, ah, root[?] there lies education and to, ah, prevent such things, ah, like terrorism, um, if you -- you -- you had, ah, to catch the people --the terrorists they would s- -- because if you don't --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it is -- it is a- always a possibility that they do s- such a thing.
L:  Yes.
R:  Um, but as far as I know -- I live in the United States for the, um -- for -- for a couple of years and, as far as I know, the only terrorist -- um, bioterrorist, ah, attack was the anthrax, ah -- they -- and I don't know if it is bi- biological or +chemical, ah, it's -- how it's considered but, um ...  I -- I -- I don't know el- -- big, ah, +chemical terrorist attack in the United States.  I didn't hear about any yet.
L:  No.  No.  'Cause there was the one in --
R:  Do you --
L:  -- Japan --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, in ninety six, I think it was -- ninety five.
R:  Yeah.  You know the, ah -- in the m- -- in the m- -- ah, metro -- metro.
L:  Yes.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  And it was an -- Japanese, um, cult I think.
L:  Mhm.  Yes.
R:  And, ah --
L:  But it -- it, um -- it was sarin mustard -- mustard gas or sarin gas --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think they released into the underground but --
R:  I -- I heard about that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And ...
L:  But you're right -- I haven't heard of, um, any sort of bioterrorism attack --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's happened in the US.
R:  But there's a threat I think.  Ah --
L:  Oh, yes.  Yeah.
R:  The -- the b- -- ah, otherwise, ah, the States wouldn't have so -- like -- or maybe they are al- already preventing it because there is no attacks so, ah, the terrorists can't be successful.
L:  Hm.  That -- that's an idea.
R:  I mean -- yeah.
L:  That's true.  Yeah.
R:  Maybe they already do because, um, you know, I come from a foreign country and I see that, ah, ah, United States is highly organized.  Very -- very good, um, ah -- very good, ah, p- police force, very good --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, everything and, um, I -- I -- I -- maybe they -- they are very good organized and prevent it and, um ...  But what makes you think that it is not possible to, ah, ah, prevent -- I mean, ah ...
L:  Yeah.  Because they look like -- I mean, it -- anybody can -- on films, when they show it --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- anybody could put a little vial of something into the hand luggage --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and walk right through security and --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- nobody will know.  Um --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, you know they, um -- yesterday, I watched t- TV and they said they had, um, caught, ah, ah, someone who had a knife in a plane.  The plane was, um, flying from -- I think -- New York to Seattle.
L:  Gosh.
R:  And, um, they don't know how, ah, the guy was, ah, successful to -- got -- got the knife on the plane.
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  And -- yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, I -- in my -- in the way of my -- ah, in my thinking they -- it's -- it's -- there's always a possibility that someone can get in a plane with a knife.  It's a -- it should -- I mean --
L:  Yeah.  'Cause they go --
R:  The -- the --
L:  -- through so much security after, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- nine eleven especially.
R:  Yeah.  So, they -- they trust very much their confidence in the security, ah, measurements and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's -- that's good.  That's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  That it -- yeah.  I think we've talked about that they are so go- -- um, successful.  And on the other hand, um, ah, they made a big job after nine eleven and, ah, I think they, um, scanned all the, um, ah, places that terrorists could be in the States and might be they have all, um -- caught, ah, that people.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know.  And -- and on the other hand, it is -- ah, we have to trust in the people --
L:  Yeah.
R:  If everyone -- if the people would -- I mean, if by a -- by using a car I could kill someone or someone could kill me and --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- that's -- roads for every drivers and --
L:  [LAUGH] That's true.
R:  But -- yeah.  But no one does it.
L: It's -- yeah.
R:  Because --
L:  Yeah.  It boils down to that, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  That we are all -- fundamentally, most people are good and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- don't want to harm other people.  But the -- I think the -- the frightening thing is that it only takes one person to, um --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- or a group of people, I suppose --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to give a vial of something to one person who comes into this country and hundreds of thousands of people will be ill.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yes.
L:  Like the -- like the anthrax, um --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- case, actually.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Just after nine eleven.
R:  Yeah.  Um, [NOISE] [PAUSE] I hope, ah, nothing will happen like that and they will, ah, ah -- but you know, the -- um, some, um, centers -- some places like the -- the Al Qaeda, like, some organizations that are bad and, um, the -- the western world is fighting against them, I mean, the -- I d- -- I think the enemy is not so big.
L:  Mm.
R:  It's not so, ah, dangerous because, um, the -- the good guys are much more, ah, ah, bigger and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- stronger and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah --
L:  And they've got much better weapons as well.
R:  Yeah.  And this ma- makes, ah, [inaudible] someone good.  Ah, I mean, the- then you feel secure and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  And I don't know if, ah, they will, ah, listen to this record and then later find out how to, ah, protect --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- or prevent [LAUGH] a --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But --
L:  That would be good. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  But [LAUGH] I don't -- I don't think that -- that we could -- we were able to give them other clues. [LAUGH]
L:  No. [LAUGH] No. [LAUGH] I honestly, I was, ah -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I read it and, ah, I just thought, "There's no way that that's possible". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] But maybe somebody else will [LAUGH] come up with some idea. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  They -- they should ask some, um, professionals.  Um, what do you do in Rhode Island?
L:  I -- I don't know.  Um, you know, what -- what sort or measures they've taken here.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I think 'cause it's such a small state so we, sort of, feel very, um, invulnerable to [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- these things whereas Boston, which is --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- just a bit further north, um -- and that was where many of the planes originated for, you know -- from -- during nine eleven.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, they've got a lot of security measures in place.
R:  You feel, ah, secure don't you?
L:  Yes, I do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I do in Rhode Island.
R:  Good.
L:  Um, I don't whether it's --
R:  If [several inaudible words]
L:  -- it's realistic [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- to feel safe. [LAUGH] What about you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- where you are?
R:  I --
L:  That must be --
R: I feel secure too in Seattle.  It's okay.  So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, actually they thought that Microsoft is an, um -- target but --
L:  Oh, yes.  Yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.  And, ah, I live very close to Microsoft but nothing happened.
L:  Mm.
R:  And, um, ah, I don't go very much near to [LAUGH] Microsoft so [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But [LAUGH] -- but my wife works there. [LAUGH] So, I --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  It's true.  I mean ...  But I don't know if -- 'cause they're not --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- really political.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I -- I, sort of, feel that, um, you know, federal buildings are targets or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, things -- the Post Office --
R:  The White House.
L:  Yes.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  The White House.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Parli- -- um, the Congress --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and Senate, um, would be targets.  Like, the Trade Center is so political -- the World Trade Center --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- was such a -- a landmark for the --
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
L:   -- for the country.  But Microsoft is more corporate -- sort of, big corporate whereas the --
R:  Yeah.  It's, ah -- I mean, there are one hundred different Microsoft buildings -- ah, which one would be the main target?
L:  Mm.
R:  Yeah.  The -- that's -- that's, ah, interesting.  I mean, because Microsoft is popular it's -- it's supposed to be a target they say and -- but they can't target, ah, one hundred buildings at the same time.
L:  No.
R:  It's not only a big one, ah, building like the World Trade Center.
L:  Mm.  Mm.
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah.  And -- and they're also all over the country as well.  I mean, they have offices everywhere.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  Um, in different parts of the country as well.  The headquarters are in Seattle but ...
R:  Yeah.  Where did you hear about this study?
L:  Um, it was on, um, a list.
R:  Oh --
L:  There's, um, a list of, um -- I don't know what it is -- a whole conglomeration of things they have.  Ah, if there's a theatre going on or jobs or --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, ah, random things.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I got it off of there.  And then I went --
R:  So, you searched on the internet?
L:  Yes.  It was on the internet.  And then I went to the website from there.  What about you?
R:  Um, it was a -- a p- -- um, ah, in the paper.  It was an ad in the newspaper.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  It sounds interesting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, what they're trying to do.
R:  I'm -- I'm still, ah -- I don't still know what it is about.  I mean, the linguistic studies, ah, it is -- is -- is a company making the study or an -- it's a university but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, they -- they've spend money on it and w- -- a lot of labor and time and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- ah, I -- I don't know if the output will be very valuable.  I, ah -- I -- I -- I wonder if -- what they will find out and I think they will not report us. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But [LAUGH] that's okay.  And it's nice to talk to people you don't know about any, ah, subject and, ah -- and, ah, you -- you are in Rhode Island and I -- I can see that we think mu- -- very much alike and --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- ah --
