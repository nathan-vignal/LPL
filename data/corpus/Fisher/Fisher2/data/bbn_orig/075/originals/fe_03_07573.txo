R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.  My name is Margaret from Oregon.
R:  Hi, Margaret.  My name's Heather from Nova Scotia.
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  Okay.  Well, let's stay on our topic.
R:  All right.
L:  I don't watch sports on TV.
R:  You don't?
L:  No.  Do you?
R:  Well, I do some.  Uh, it depends on what's on.  Like, recently I started watching the, um, US Open.
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  And we were watching that this weekend, uh --
L:  That's golf, isn't it?
R:  Yes.
L:  Was it the men's or the ladies?
R:  It was the la- the men's.
L:  Ah.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Now, was that the one where the lady was participating in the men's?
R:  No.  Uh, she apparently bowed out because she's not good enough to plac- compete with the men.
L:  Well, that proves it right there, huh?
R:  Exactly.  
L:  I watched about ten minutes of the uh, um, ladies' golf one day.  I was at my friend's house and I found it very, very boring.
R:  Oh, did you?
L:  Yes.
R:  Well, I think probably the reason that I'm so interested in it now is my husband works at a golf course.
L:  Ah.
R:  And we play golf on tee -- we've got the Tiger Woods' game, so we play golf on TV so we're always looking at -- at other people golfing now.
L:  Their form and everything?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, ah ha, ha, ha. Aha.  Boy, I don't know what -- I don't have a whole lot to say about golf, really.  Um --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I have lots of friends that golf.  They go out to the driving range and they're favorite thing is, I guess they call it the nineteenth tee.  Is that where you go to the clubhouse?
R:  Yes.  
L:  Ah, yeah.  They're --
R:  Yeah, that's it exactly.  Well --
L:  That's where they go to have their fun, I guess.  

R:  Yeah.  What about other sports?  Do you watch, um, like horseback riding or baseball?
L:  Um, I -- on the Olympics, I always watch the sports on the Olympics.  Now, I can't say I never watch sports on TV but whenever the Olympics are on, I like to watch, like, the gymnastics and the ice skating and um I especially like all -- almost all of the Winter Olympics.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So yeah, I find that quite entertaining.  When they do all the scoring and stuff and I like to see if I agree with the judges and all that stuff and -- and I watch a little bit of basketball when I'm over at my friend's house.  He likes to watch basketball, so I watch that a little bit.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  But --
R:  Of course, being -- being Canadian, you know, us and hockey, I watch a lot of hockey on TV.
L:  That's it, you know.  Hockey --
R:  Especially the local hockey.  We've got a local team here that um we go to see when they're in town and we watch them on TV when they're away from home. 
L:  Hockey's really uh popular here in Port- we have a team in Portland, Oregon.  It's about an hour north of where I live.  And it's the Winter Hocks, and it's really, really popular.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Very popular.  And then with our basketball team, you know, we have some uh -- the Portland Trailblazers and they're quite a controversial team, with all their drug charges, amongst other things.  So they're in the news quite a bit.  Quite a bit.  And we're looking to, uh, they're gonna open a -- uh, a uh, uh -- they're trying to get a professional baseball team up here, too.  PGE, which is Portland General Electric is gonna be uh televising some professional games from their own venue.  So that should be exciting.  I might watch some of that.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Where I come from, uh, well I live in the city, but I -- I came -- I moved from a rural area --
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  -- and the town that I moved from is supposedly the birthplace of hockey.
L:  Right on.  
R:  And they're twins with the birth -- birthplace of baseball in the States, and I forget exactly what town it -- that is, so --
L:  Somewhere in New York, I think.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I could be wrong, but yeah.
R:  I think so.
L:  We have a lot of uh pay purview sports on our Cable channels down here.
R:  Oh, right?
L:  Yeah.  So a lot --
R:  You --
L:  -- of people order that.  And I don't know, I don't even know what sports are in season on the TV.  Oh, I just looked at my TV guide.
R:  [LAUGH].  Right now it's golf.  Lots of golf.
L:  Yeah, and there's some basketball on, too, according --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to the TV guide.
R:  Yes.  I usually don't --
L:  Can I --
R:  -- watch too much basketball.  I have watched boxing on TV.
L:  Yeah.  My neighbor gets into that, and the wrestling.
R:  Yep.  I used to watch wrestling, but it's so commercialized now that I don't even bother.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  I think the last boxing match that I watched, I was actually in the States and it was a pay purview.  It was the one where um Mike Tyson bit off the guy's ear.
L:  Oh, yeah.  That was quite a few years ago.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Now, we do -- we are big on racing on TV around here.  Car racing.  
R:  Oh, right.
L:  Yeah.  We have a -- a -- um, up in Portland again they have a huge uh venue where they do uh like Indy cars and Nascars and stuff.  And that's really big around here.  Very exciting.
R:  Yeah.  I used to watch a lot of that, too.  Um, especially -- well, just before the man in black died, I guess, and --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That kinda -- it kinda uh got a little bit less popular.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  I know it -- I know it's really popular on the East Coast of the United States and I know you guys are on the eastern part of that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- part of the continent, so you guys don't do a lot of car racing in Nova Scotia?
R:  Well, we've got a track out here and uh we go out to see that.  It's -- but it's um just a small track.
L:  Ah.  
R:  It's -- it's not --
L:  Like at [inaudible] or something?
R:  -- like the Indy five hundreds or anything like that.
L:  Ah.
R:  But we do watch that on TV when it's on.  My husband likes that, so --
L:  Yep.  I love to watch car racing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's really exciting.  Really exciting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  When you see -- 
R:  I like the um the kind -- the smash up derby kind.
L:  Oh, the demolition derby?
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  That's a hoot.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  I like that, too. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Let me see.  What else are they listing here?  Base -- bowling's fun on TV.
R:  Bowling, yeah.
L:  I love --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- to watch bowling on TV.
R:  I used to watch it a lot.  I used to be in a league so I watched it when I was in a league.  I haven't seen it on TV for a -- quite some time. 
L:  We used to watch the professional bowling, when I used to be married.  We loved it.  We'd make bets on them all and everything.  We --
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  We thought that was great fun.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Great fun.  
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Let me see what else?  There is a lot of uh basketball, boxing, golf.  Wow, this is a little bit of everything on.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Cheerleading.  They have cheerleading as a sport.  
R:  Yes.  
L:  I watch -- uh, I don't know if poker is considered a sport, but I watched that on TV the other day.
R:  Oh, yeah?  I st-
L:  Yeah, the --
R:  I started watching uh -- I -- I don't know if this counts like poker, but um, I started watching dog agility.
L:  Oh.  How much fun is that?
R:  Yeah.  I wanna get my dogs into it.  I don't know if they'd be good at it, but I like watching them.
L:  Oh, it wo- yeah, I love that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Anything -- yeah.  I li- I used to live on a park here in the town I'm in, and they used to have those every weekend in the summertime out there.  That was great fun.  And I've watched the billiards, too on TV.
R:  Oh, yeah?  That's right.
L:  That's kinda fun, too.
R:  Yep.
L:  I'm a -- I'm a terrible pool player, but I like to watch 'em play.
R:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.  Make that shot.  Oh no, there's no way that he can make that shot.  Oh, my God, he made it.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Exactly.  And then, you know, they have, like, karate on TV.  That doesn't excite me too much.  Here they list lacrosse.  Do you have a clue what that is?
R:  That is uh something like squash, I think.
L:  Ooh.
R:  It's got that netted -- um, what is it?
L:  Is that that thing with the --
R:  It almost looks like a hockey stick, but it's got a big net on the back of it.
L:  Yeah, that goofy curved thing they hold in their hand?
R:  Yeah.  Something like that.
L:  Yeah.  That might be fun to watch.
R:  Yeah.

R:  And those kids, they're just -- ah like, they break your heart watching them.  They're just so good.
L:  I can't run a mile.  I don't care if it takes an hour.  I can't run a mile.
