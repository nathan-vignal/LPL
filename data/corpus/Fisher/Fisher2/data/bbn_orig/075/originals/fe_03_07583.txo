L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.  [LAUGH].
L:  Hi.  I hate sports.
R:  This is always awkward.
L:  Huh?
R:  Uh, my name is Dianne and I live in Sierra Vista, Arizona.  
L:  Oh, I live in um California, Lancaster.
R:  Oh, cool.  
L:  And I was actually supposed to go to Phoenix this weekend, but I didn't.  
R:  Oh, really? 
L:  Mhm.  I bid on an entertainment center on eBay.
R:  Oh, cool.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Here, you do it.  I have a two year old and we're making cookies, so --
L:  Huh.
R:  Do -- do you watch --
L:  Well, like --
R:  -- sports on TV?
L:  No.  I grew up with a father who did, and that's pretty much all he did, when he was home.
R:  Oh.  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  He came home, straight from work and sat down and ate dinner in front of the TV and fell asleep in front of the TV and --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Football, baseball --
R:  Whole areas?
L:  That -- that -- the announcer for the Dodgers, I can just vividly remember his voice.  I will never forget it.  Huh.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  On the A.M. radio.  But otherwise, we don't ever watch sports around here.  I like the Olympics.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I like the ice skating.
L:  Mhm.  And the -- the aerobic -- or the acrobats.
R:  Oh, the --
L:  I mean, the --
R:  -- gymnastics?
L:  Yeah, the gymnastics.
R:  Yes.  Yeah, I watch a little bit of it.  Not a lot.  We're just not a big TV people kind of a house.
L:  Yeah, neither are we.
R:  I -- yeah.  I do day care in the home so we're very hands on or whatever, you know what I mean?
L:  Mhm?  
R:  'Cause it's very hard to get into a movie any more [LAUGH] 'cause you're normally pulled away by crayons on the walls or what [LAUGH] you know?  Or some kind of --
L:  Well, I have an --
R:  -- catastrophe.
L:  I have an interesting six year old.  He can sit there through a whole movie, no problem.  
R:  Mm.
L:  He can sit there through two movies.
R:  Mm.
L:  He doesn't -- it's -- it's hard to get him to play with his toys, stuff like that.  He wants video games and he wants TV.  
R:  And how old is he?
L:  Six.
R:  Oh, wow.  
L:  Mhm.  
R:  Mm.
L:  His fifteen year old brother didn't help, but --
R:  Mm.  
L:  He's the one that got him into the video games and he used to have fun playing until his brother taught him about winning.
R:  [NOISE].  Yeah.  
L:  Now he wants to win everything, but for now he just -- 
R:  No --
L:  But he --
R:  No, Kitty.  
L:  The TVs never on when he's not here.
R:  Yeah.  Um, that's funny.  Well, my little guy is so -- he's only two, so of course, he just watches whatever -- if we're on, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And he don't ever really watch it, you know?  He watches, like, Dora the Explorer in the morning a little bit, but that's about it.  So I guess we should talk about sports, or we don't get paid.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I like the -- I like to play sports, I just don't like watching.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I played -- yeah, I played sports in, uh, high school and junior high and all the way up, and then I went to college and didn't really play anything, so -- but I was a soccer, basketball girl.  Those were my loves.
L:  I used to play mostly softball.  
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Uh-huh, and I like volleyball.
R:  Mm.  Do you ever watch, um, horse riding on -- on TV, how they do the jumps and jumps and --
L:  No, it's just too slow.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  I've been to a -- I've been to the um -- the team [inaudible] you know, live, but not on TV.
R:  Mm.  Yeah.  Like golf, that drives me insane.  I can't watch golf on TV.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That, to me -- you -- you know how you said that's too slow?  Ugh.
L:  Mhm?
R:  Golf, to me, is like pulling my hair out, one by one.  It's horrible.  [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.
R:  But um -- and football?  Oh, my God, my husband's one of those -- he watches all the Raiders' games and things like that, which is horrible to me.  And I don't know if you consider it a sport, but like, wrestling?  My husband --
L:  Well, that's a sport.
R:  -- watches wrestling twice a week, too, so -- what is it?  No, Mondays and Thursdays.  W.W. --
L:  But isn't most of that staged?
R:  Mhm.
L:  It -- yeah.
R:  Yeah, it's just a fun --
L:  It looks like it is.
R:  -- thing.  It's totally -- I mean, they even had a thing on TV called, um, Tough Enough --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- where a bunch of the guys and girls and whatnot would go and compete to be a wrestler and they show you all the moves and how to do them to where no one gets hurt, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's all -- that's all stage baloney stuff, but it's made to look real and -- and they all have a character that they play and um, you know, they're either a mean guy or a good guy or a real jerk or -- or not, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  So it's just like stage performing, only they make huge, huge money.  
L:  Oh, do they?  
R:  Mhm.
L:  I guess that's why they don't mind being beaten?
R:  Yeah, oh yeah.  No.  Um, they -- oh, my God, the amount of money that goes in there.  I'd throw me around [LAUGH] I'd sign up for that in a minute.  But they've put a couple people out of commission.  There was um one girl, Lita, she just got um put in hospital for breaking her neck.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And -- yeah.  And she was --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- laid up for a long time and she -- we still haven't seen her on TV in a long time, and um, I'm betting she's probably scared to get back in the ring.  You know, so when it --
L:  Well, I bet whoever did it feels bad?
R:  Yeah.  Because when a throw goes wrong or, oops, you accidentally did it too rough or whatever, someone can really get hurt bad.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that's why they're so strict on them about, you know, making everything the way it needs to be and -- and the right, proper form and whatnot.  It's -- it's almost like -- how do you call that?  Um, almost like a dance, you know?  Proper form of everything.  This has to be proper form, that has to be proper form --
L:  Yeah -- etiquette?  
R:  Huh?
L:  Etiquette?  
R:  Yes.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Yes.  That's the way it has to be.
L:  But they both have to be right, otherwise one can get hurt.
R:  Yes.  Yes.  'Cause she might of gotten thrown right, but if she didn't fall correctly, you know, then she hurt herself, and I'm not quite sure with the whole story on it.  All I know is that she got thrown real hard off the stage or some baloney and the next, you know, we didn't see her, and then they're like, but you never know what's real and what's not, 'cause lots of times they say things, like, you know, "Oh, they're gonna be put in the hospital for a month, argh, argh, argh, argh" and it's all baloney.  They're just saying it as part of the uh production and what not, you know?
L:  Mm.
R:  But you never know what's real and what's not.  That's what I don't like -- 
L:  Well, they're kinda like --
R:  -- about it.  It's kinda like?  Are you there?  
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?  
L:  Oh, did I leave you?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm on my cell phone, I don't --
R:  Oh.
L:  I used to love my service and then it started going in and out on me. 
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Mhm.  
R:  So, what did you say?  It was kinda like, what?
L:  Well, I said -- I said they were kinda like stunt men.
R:  Yeah.  I think they're a lot like that.  But it's just all make believe, and I don't like when you can't tell what's real and what's not.  That -- it confuses me, you know? 
L:  Mm.
R:  They go on and on, on these scenarios that are outside of the wrestling and then inside of the wrestling, and whatever.  I just don't think --
L:  Yeah, they go to the locker rooms before and go, "Ooh, my God, I'm gonna get him".
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].  Yeah.  So, the only -- I guess the only real sport person that I know, like, that plays really, like sports sports, is like Dan Marino.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And the only reason I know anything about him is 'cause I'm so children involved, that I -- that is a kitty, yes, honey.  That um -- it's 'cause I'm so children involved and I know, um, different celebrities and what not that have done adoptions and things --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- and that have had problems with their children and what not, and if I remember right, um, Dan Marino was the one who had an autistic child, I think.
L:  I -- I have no idea.
R:  He -- he either got -- there's two of 'em.  There's two football players, Dan Marino and one other guy and I forget his name right now, um, and I get them confused all the time.  One of them adopted a child from China and one of them had an autistic child and he started an au- um, an autistic fundraiser, a -- what do you call it?  A charity.  He started --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- a charity for autism and all the funds go to help the children with autism and for the research of helping children with autism.  So those kind of name -- you would think I'd remember the other name and I -- I've drawn a blank 'cause I'm trying to tell you about it, of course, but [LAUGH] it's those kind of names --
L:  Yeah, but there's so many -- there are so many funds out there that -- that -- you couldn't remember them all.
R:  Right.  Right.  So it's just those are the kind of names that I remember in sports.  I don't really remember them for, you know, them playing quarterback or being a line back or being whatever.  I just remember, you know, what kinds of things that they've done with the children or not done or -- you know what I mean?
L:  Mhm.
R:  They're really neat people on the inside, or if they're real scumbags, so [LAUGH] that's all I really remember from people, 'cause I really don't get into the sports.  My husband does, and he normally fills me in on lots of the different um -- different guys.  He's like, "No, you're gonna like this guy.  This guy started a charity for this and this and that", and I'm like, "Oh, okay.  I like him now".  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]. 
R:  'Cause I just don't have any use, really, for these people that make millions and millions of dollars for sitting on the sidelines, you know?
L:  Yeah, but there's just so many people that are into it.
R:  Ah, it just -- I guess I'm just --
L:  And the Super Bowl Sunday is --
R:  -- jealous.  I wish I could sit my butt on the sideline and make one point three million dollars a year, you know?  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, but I don't think I'd want to have the body when I was done.
R:  Yeah.  I guess.  It's just something else.  I got a kitty.  Oh.  So, what about your family?  Um, are you married?
L:  Yeah, I'm married.  Mm.
R:  Yeah.  Does he watch sports and stuff?
L:  No.  
R:  No?  
L:  Nope.
R:  So you got lucky?  [LAUGH].
L:  I know.  
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Well, I would -- I would never marry somebody like my father, who did that.  I just -- he was -- he wasn't even a father.  My parents divorced when I was six, but -- but him -- and he would just come home from work and he would plop himself down on the couch in front of the TV and eat dinner and fall asleep there and -- and then Sunday was sports and --
