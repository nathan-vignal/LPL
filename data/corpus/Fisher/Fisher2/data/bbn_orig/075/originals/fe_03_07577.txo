R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  This is Mary and I'm from Wisconsin.
L:  And I'm Malka[?] and I'm from Tucson.
R:  Oh.
L:  So it's probably warmer here than it is there.
R:  [LAUGH].  We just finished talking to um my father in law who lives in Phoenix and he always describes it as crispy this time of year.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  We -- we generally refer to it as mummifying.  [LAUGH].
R:  Ooh.
L:  Because you walk outdoors and it's -- it's so dry.  I mean, when it gets humid a lot of people from here complain, but once --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the monsoons start, I think it feels better because at least you don't walk outside and feel like all the liquid is getting sucked out [LAUGH] of you --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- as you walk outdoors.  But you've been to visit your dad?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, we used to live in San Diego. 
L:  Mhm?
R:  Well, when we lived in San Diego, we would drive over, but now that we live in Wisconsin, we've flown down probably three times or so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in the last couple of years.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, yeah.  I mean, I really, really miss the warm weather, in the winter time.
L:  Oh.
R:  You know?  Our weather's only nice -- I think it's only nice about three months out of the year.
L:  Oh.
R:  And right now it's really nice, but um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, in the winter it sure would be nice to be living down there.
L:  Where'd you grow up?
R:  I grew up in Wisconsin.
L:  Ah, so you're used to it?
R:  Yeah.  I am used to it, yeah, but then um after college, we -- I lived in San Diego 'cause I was in the Navy.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I met my husband, who grew up in San Diego.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So the two of us lived in, you know, that climate for a while and then --
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  -- we decided when we had kids that we wanted to come back to the Midwest.  Which I think was a good move.  It's just very frustrating to be in this cold stuff, you know?  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Well, in the middle of the winter, I guess it's a little chilly and --
R:  Oh, it's very --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And we -- actually, today was the first day that it was -- I felt nice enough to go to the pool.  It didn't -- the pool didn't even open up during the week days until uh last week.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Was the first time that it was open during the week.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- if you can imagine waiting that long [LAUGH] to go -- get --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in the pool?
L:  Mhm.  Wow.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Anyway, I grew up in Buffalo so --
R:  Oh, you did?
L:  -- I guess I have a pretty good idea.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  How long have you lived in Tucson?
L:  But you tend to forget.  Uh, ten years, about.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But we're supposed to be talking about sports?
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  TV sports.  Okay.  So you go first.  Tell me what sports you like on TV?
R:  Um --
L:  Silence.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  You know, the truth is, I really don't watch much sports on TV.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I -- I guess in the fall I like to watch a football game or two, but I really don't understand the sport that well.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, how about you?
L:  I think the only sports that I watch on TV are when the Olympics come on.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And then -- and -- and especially, like, the Winter Olympics.  I really like the -- the skiing and I really like the -- the skating a lot.  Not the racing skating, but a lot of the other skating things I really enjoy.  I like a lot of the winter sports, the -- when you see the Olympics on TV and then the Summer Olympics, I guess I don't really watch much, but the diving.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.
L:  So I guess I'm not really a competition sport kind of a person.  But um -- but do you watch the -- the Olympics when they're on?
R:  I do.  I love the Olympics.  Yeah.  Um --
L:  And in -- and the winter ones must be something -- your kids are probably learning how to ski?  No?
R:  No, we haven't --
L:  Or is flat around there?
R:  No.  Actually there are some -- I mean, it's not mountains.  There's hills, but um it's expensive, you know?  It's not as expensive --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- as it is down there, but they're --
L:  Oh well, here --
R:  -- still young.  My kids are three and five, so --
L:  Oh.  They're little.
R:  Too young to --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- invest in an expensive pair of skis.  [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.  Oh, absolutely not.
R:  But we have gone --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- um a few times and I do like skiing, yeah.
L:  I like watching it.  I would be scared to death to do it.  [LAUGH].
R:  How far away are the ski slopes from Tucson?
L:  Ah, not far.  I mean, it's basically the same thing as -- I guess in Phoenix probably, it's like half an hour.
R:  Oh, that's all?  
L:  Yeah, because you know, you're down in the valley and then you start climbing and you get to -- to where it's snowing.
R:  Is that Mount Lennon[?]?   Is that where you mean?
L:  Yeah, that's Mount Lennon.  Mhm.  
R:  And -- and they're skiing out there?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, I didn't know that.
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  Is it all year long?
L:  Oh, no.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.
L:  But it's in the middle of the winter.  It's an expensive ski resort kind of a place.
R:  Oh.
L:  And then in the summer, it's the -- the kind of place that people have cottages so that -- I mean, somebody who owns a cottage, so that they can move down twenty degrees, which is still eighty degrees.  It isn't like it's cold in the mountains, but you know, at least it's not a hundred ten or a hundred twenty.
R:  Is that what it is today?
L:  A hundred six or seven.
R:  Oh, my gosh.  
L:  Yeah.  It -- Diego isn't like that?  Okay.  [LAUGH].
R:  San Diego?
L:  Yeah?
R:  No.  No.  Weather wise, it's perfect.  It's about eighty --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- most of the year.  
L:  That's what most people have told me.
R:  Yeah.  It never really gets too hot and it never really gets too cold.  
L:  And even if it gets in the eighties, you can go in the ocean.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And cool off, so --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  -- it sounds ideal.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  But -- 
R:  Although the ocean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is -- the ocean is cold on the west coast.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  So we didn't -- I didn't get in too much.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Without a wet suit.  Even if it's a hot day, it's kinda chilly in -- in the ocean.
L:  Ah well, you were in the Navy, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so you must like watching swimming competitions, too, no?
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  No? 
R:  Uh, I suppose a little bit.  We never really had to do much swimming though in the Navy.  I did take a scuba class, though.  This is the funny thing.  We had -- I decided to be a little um adventuresome and get scuba certified --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- in the Navy.  
L:  Mhm?
R:  And I ended up taking this class that was taught by some marines.
L:  Mhm?
R:  And it was just the funniest thing.  They were really hard on us and I flunked the class miserably.  
L:  Oh.
R:  Because it was so hard.  If you can imagine --
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  -- some marines trying to teach you how to scuba dive?
L:  Yeah.  Well --
R:  And I never went since.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, that's a shame.  It's supposed to be so beautiful to do that.  No?
R:  It is.  It is, but we had to swim -- they took us to the ocean and we had to swim through the surf --
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  -- and I wasn't strong enough to swim through the surf.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So I had -- fortunately my partner was a male and he pulled me through.
L:  Oh.
R:  And we got through the surf, but then -- then we had to go down, of course, and when we came back up, we all were vomiting 'cause it was such a rough day --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and we got bloody noses from the pressure --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- cages and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it was miserable.  [LAUGH].
L:  Well, I guess that's partly because when I think of scuba diving, I -- I guess I'm thinking of, "I'll go down and look at all the pretty fish that you can see" and if you're in the Navy and you're getting scuba certified, it's not to -- to look at the pretty fish, it's to, you know, hook a bomb onto some kind of submarine or something.
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  Right?  And be a -- what do they call them?
R:  A seal?
L:  A seal.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Well, you know, this was supposed to be just a recreational thing, but --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I don't know.  It was -- I think the problem was it was just a very choppy day when we were there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they didn't let us go off boats.  I've heard, you know, people that go to, like, resort areas --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- who get certified in scuba get to jump off a boat or something and that would be much easier than trying to swim through the surf and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- swallowing all that salt water on the way.
L:  Mm.  Yeah, you're right.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  And then losing it again.  
R:  Oh.
L:  Oh.  
R:  And you know, everybody's head was bobbing on the surface of the ocean.
L:  Mhm?
R:  And then everyone was vomiting, too, and it was just gross.
L:  Right into the water?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Well, I guess into the water.  Ooh.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  Okay.  Doesn't sound like fun.
R:  [LAUGH]. 
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  No.  What do you do for a living?
L:  Oh, I -- I do research.
R:  Oh, interesting.
L:  Oh, I think it's fun, but you know -- but we're supposed to be talking about all these --
R:  Sporting --
L:  -- sports.  I feel bad.  We -- because we probably spent less time talking about sports on TV than --
R:  Isn't --
L:  -- we're supposed to.
R:  Aren't they actually just trying to study our linguistics?  Isn't that what the study is for?
L:  Um --
R:  No?
