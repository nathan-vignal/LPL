L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, my name is Naomi.
R:  What's -- what is your name?
L:  Naomi.
R:  Naomi, I'm Miriam, ha.  
L:  Ha, hi.  Sporting -- sports on TV, huh?
R:  Yes.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  How sporty --
L:  Do you watch any of 'em?
R:  Yeah, by default [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, okay.  That --
R:  My --
L:  -- makes sense.
R:  My fiance, he's really into sports, so -- but I mean, I like to watch it.  It's not like I make him turn it off or anything like that, but it's just, you know, it's something to watch.  [LAUGH].
L:  Right, yes.  That's kinda how I watch it, too.  Like, I don't actually follow stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Except for, um, figure skating during the Olympics, I'll get enthused on that.
R:  I am too, and I like gymnastics in the summer.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So --
L:  Yeah.  And I -- I grew up in Holland where soccer is the biggest deal ever --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so I watch lots and lots of that.
R:  Um --
L:  But not, like, I never actually go, like, "Oh, on Sunday there's this game which I have to watch" or --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- anything like that.
R:  Yeah.  So.  Um, a lot of football, so --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  See, that I didn't have, so that I definitely never watch.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think I've been to like, one, Super Bowl ever.  
R:  Just watching?  [LAUGH] or --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
R:  -- you actually are --
L:  Like, one Super Bowl party, [LAUGH].
R:  No, that's cool.  So um --
L:  But --
R:  -- do people in Holland -- is it different, the way they watch sports, than they do here?
L:  I don't think so.  No, I don't -- it's pretty much -- it's pretty much the same.  Um, they had -- when I went back to visit they actually had the uh -- I don't remember if it was, like, the European Cup or the World Cup, or something was going on in Holland and Belgium --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- and so they had tons and tons of fans from other places and there were, like, certain bars that were designated to certain countries [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then there'd be, like, you know, but they'd be on the same square --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- so they'd either be, like, screaming on one side or screaming on the other.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Um, but it's -- as much as it, like, can get aggressive, it's pretty friendly.  
R:  Oh.
L:  It's like, in Amsterdam, all these -- but they're really -- they had riots and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but among cities in Holland and stuff like that all the time.
R:  Yeah.  Everyone in the streets?
L:  Yep.  [LAUGH].  So -- but I don't -- I can imagine getting that into it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, even the soccer games I went to, I didn't watch on TV, it's -- I mean, it seemed pretty friendly, but I can't imagine, like, actually trying to beat someone up over it.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Did you play any sports or -- no?  Or --
L:  Um, I played soccer for a little bit, and then I was always one of those -- like, I had jazz ballet and dancing classes --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- of various sorts.
R:  Oh, that's neat.
L:  So, but nothing uh --
R:  Yeah.  I -- I didn't play too many sports, but like, you know -- like, as a -- like in high school or anything like that, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- just like just for fun.
L:  Yeah, I was more of a theatre --
R:  Yeah.  Um, so how much sports do you watch during a week?  How many hours?  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  Um, currently probably none.  Um, but when I watched -- like, when I lived with my cousin, I did watch baseball.  Um, I'd catch a game here and there.  I -- actually, I coached a Little League for a while so when I did that --
R:  Oh, that's neat.
L:  -- I was kinda into baseball.  But um --
R:  Yeah, 'cause I -- during football season, it's probably whatever is on the weekends, and it would probably run from, like what, twelve to eight or nine o'clock?
L:  Right.
R:  So -- but like, right now --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I'm not in -- like, we're not into baseball.  I mean, he likes the Cubs and everything like that, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's just to find out what the score is.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Rather than to watch --
L:  Yeah, exact- --
R:  -- 'cause --
L:  Oh, that happens, too.  Yeah.  My boyfriend will turn on the TV just to check real quick.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I think he usually stays home to watch.  I don't get looked into those things.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Um, boxing matches we watch.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Wrestling and stuff.  I guess that counts, too.
R:  Yeah.  Um, golf is pretty interesting to me --
L:  Is it?
R:  -- nowadays.  Well, yeah.  I guess I've just --
L:  [MN].
R:  -- been kind of more into it with the US Open, so --
L:  Right.  
R:  -- I -- I --
L:  I don't think I've ever watched it.  Like, I vaguely know how it works, but --
R:  Really?  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Even though I nothing at all -- [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  It's just a recent thing.  Probably like a whole Tiger Woods thing, but I don't know --
L:  Right?
R:  -- I'm kinda following it and um tennis every now and then, but not -- I couldn't tell you the -- the players were.  I would just watch.
L:  Right.
R:  'Cause I, you know, used to watch it on -- way back when, but --
L:  Yeah.  But that's what I found out with tennis, I think.  Like, I don't actively watch it, but occasionally I'll catch a game and end up really, like, watching part of it without even really doing it intentionally.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, I'll start watching and I'll be like, "Oh, okay" and then after, like, fifteen minutes I'll get bored of it and just watch --
R:  Yeah.  You can only watch so much.
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.  Um --
R:  Um -- 
L:  And because I don't follow the scores, I don't really care who wins in the end anyways, so --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  -- doesn't really matter.
R:  Most of the time --
L:  But I'll watch soccer.  That's probably pretty much it.
R:  Yeah.  I do, too.  My brother used to play soccer so --
L:  Mm.  Yeah.
R:  -- and uh he still actually does, like in soccer clubs and things like that, but --
L:  Yeah, that's cool.
R:  I got into it -- I played when I was a little kid, but um --
L:  Right?
R:  -- I had bad knees so [LAUGH] I couldn't --
L:  Mm.  [LAUGH].
R:  -- play too many sports with that, so --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Um --
L:  I'm trying to think of other sports that are on TV.  Well, there's always wrestling, but I really know nothing about that.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I don't know if it counts as a sport either.
R:  Yeah, 'cause it's more like fake to me.
L:  [LAUGH].  Plus you have to pay to watch it, I think, don't you?
R:  Yeah, it's like on --
L:  I think it's all on Pay Per View --
R:  -- Pay Per View.
L:  -- and stuff?  Yeah.  
R:  Um --
L:  Other than that -- 
R:  Gee -- 
L:  Mm.  Or swimming or stuff like that, that's probably on.
R:  Yeah, I usually see that, like, in Olympic sports.
L:  Right.  Yeah.  I watch the Olympics a lot.  That's um -- that's fun to watch.
R:  Yeah.  I --
L:  But again, I don't know the names of the people as much as, like, you know, country wise.
R:  Right.  
L:  So but the gymnastics, some of  the elements are really neat.  Um --
R:  Do you watch, um, women's sports --
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  -- that are on TV?  Yeah?  
L:  I -- not again, not [LAUGH] regularly.
R:  Yeah, I know, I'm not --
L:  But I'll catch a game.
R:  Uh, if it's on and it's something interesting.  Basketball, I mean, I like basketball just because it's more fast paced.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  That's definitely true.
R:  And it doesn't take too long and -- but most of the time I'll turn it on in the beginning and then I'll turn it on in the end [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] exactly.
R:  I can't make -- I don't know, maybe it's A.D.D. or something, I can't sit and watch.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  The whole thing.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  So --
L:  I went to a hockey game and that was kinda cool, but I don't think I could watch it on TV.
R:  Yeah.  I can't do that either.
L:  I think the --
R:  See, I'm more of, like, of uh, the ending of a sport because -- of the game --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because the -- you know, you find out what's going on, but --
L:  Yeah.  I think that is -- it's probably the difference between, like, seeing in real life, at least it's like entertaining enough to -- 'cause then you're in the atmosphere, so you actually are rooting for something or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so that it's kinda different, but on TV, there's -- it has to be something I really like or I'll just have really nothing better to do, otherwise I don't really watch, like -- with the exception of ice skating 'cause that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like, since I was little, I followed that, so I actually kinda know the people.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And stuff.  But other than that --
R:  Well, it -- yeah, I -- I enjoy ice skating, too.  Um but other than that, I don't really think that I actually, like, look in the TV guide to find --
L:  No.  Definitely not.
R:  -- um, what's on --
L:  We have --
R:  -- some sports.
L:  -- Yes Network now, which I guess is a Yankees' channel or -- I think it's sponsored by the Yankees at least, I'm not sure, but there -- there's always sports on it and I kinda just always flip over the channel to see if --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  So --
R:  Where are you from?  Or where do you live?
L:  Uh, in -- I'm in New Jersey, near Brunswick.
R:  Okay.  Okay.  'Cause I'm in Illinois, so --
L:  Oh.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  Kinda neat how all these things come together.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  It's very -- um, I haven't done -- I only did one other conversation.
R:  Yeah, so did I.  [LAUGH].
L:  But uh [LAUGH] and it was actually also about sports.
R:  Really?
L:  But -- yeah.  Oh, well.  [LAUGH].
R:  Um, yeah, 'cause I -- I'm never -- I -- they -- I always hear it on my answering machine, but I'm never around.
L:  Isn't it an annoying message, too?  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].  Even when you pick up the phone --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so, I don't know.
L:  It's -- no, I -- they call me more often, but it's always at an inopportune -- I'm on a cell phone and often it's just like, oh, I can't really leave for ten minutes now.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  But if I'm not doing anything important, then it's cool.
R:  Yeah.  Um, I don't even [LAUGH] have you gotten paid or have you known --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- anybody that --
L:  I got -- yeah.  Um, I got a check for the first call I did.  That was a while ago, but I got it.  So --
R:  Um, I -- I don't even know how much -- how much is it?
L:  It's ten dollars per conversation.
R:  Oh.  Well, that's not bad.
L:  And then if you refer other people, you get, I think, a dollar for every person that actually does the conversation after you refer them.
R:  Mm. 
L:  Or something.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I've had my conversation a while back.  I don't know.  Maybe not too long.
L:  You can alway- it took -- it took my check, like, a while to get.  Like, I didn't -- I kinda forgot about it and then I got it in the mail, but I'm sure if you were to email, um, they would instantly send it to you.
R:  Yeah.  It's kinda neat.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  I don't know --
L:  It's kinda fun to forget about it and then randomly get --
R:  Ten dollars.
L:  Ten dollars, right.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  You know?  Don't spend it all in one place.
R:  Yeah.  You can, you know, go to a game.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, that's true, I'm sorry.  [LAUGH].
R:  Have them pay for it.
L:  Or have some Pay Per View wrestling.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know.  So --
L:  But --
R:  I'm thinking that --
L:  -- other than that --
R:  Sometimes I think ten minutes is a long time.
L:  Yeah.  Isn't it weird?  I don't actually -- I didn't actually look at the clock when it started so I don't know what time -- what time -- when it's gonna -- but it tells you when it's done, right?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah, and --
L:  So --
R:  -- this is -- yeah, when it's up, so --
L:  Mm.
R:  I only know one other person that, you know, the person that referred me --
L:  Uh-huh --
