R:  Hi, this is Jill from Kansas City.
L:  Hi.  This is Liz from, um, Michigan.  Heh.
R:  How you doing?
L:  I'm all right.  How are you doing?  [LAUGH].
R:  I'm okay.  I just got home from work.
L:  Oh, yeah?  
R:  Mm.
L:  I wish I could say the same, but I'm having one of those lazy days.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, I don't blame you.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Do you watch sports on TV?
L:  Very rarely.  When it's on, it's like with -- my dad has them on, and that's about it.  [LAUGH].
R:  Really?  Yeah, I don't um -- the only time I watch sports is if it's football and if it's the Chiefs.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  That's the home team.  So --
L:  Oh, I don't -- yeah, we have the Lions, and they're not like anything hot so [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I don't -- I don't really care too much 'em.  I watch some college sports.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  I guess, on TV, when they're on.  Like, football.
R:  Do you watch it, I mean, like college -- your area college or --
L:  Um, yeah.  Well, no and yeah.  Like, Michigan -- Michigan State and that.  I -- my college doesn't have a good sports team, so I mean [LAUGH] I --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Um, I -- I like it a little bit and --
R:  Mm.
L:  That's about -- I -- sometimes I'll watch, like, E.S.P. on like the -- when they have their little cheerleading or dance competitions.  [LAUGH].
R:  I know.  That's what I watch.  I like the -- you know, when they do the drum line --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- stuff or the --
L:  U.D.A., yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's about the only sports I guess I -- I didn't think about that.  I guess figure skating, I watch that, too.
L:  Oh, yes.  Figure skating, like, the Olympics and all that stuff?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I like to watch the Olympics.  I guess I didn't think about that either, mm.
L:  I know -- there are a lot of sports, but I [LAUGH] don't -- like, normally I just don't -- I don't really go and turn on the TV and first game or something unless somebody is, like, can you please tell me the score and then I'll be, like, um, let me check.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  I know.  I -- if I have to clean the house or something, I might put it on, just to hear it, 'cause I don't really care to watch it, uh, really that exciting.
L:  No.  [LAUGH].  I think I -- most people would rather be there, but I guess --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there's an entire lot of people that must watch it if [LAUGH] some big thing.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I used to live with two guys that was -- that was, like, their ritual, on Sundays was, you know, start getting ready around ten --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- for the game at noon and it's, like, you gotta make the meal that surrounds it and then you got to sit down and get comfortable with everything.  It's like, oh, my God.
L:  [LAUGH].  Too much, it's a guy thing.  Too much of a big deal for that.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  So, rather not watch --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Well, I have -- I have a three year old, so I have better things to do --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- with my time anyway.
L:  Oh, of course.  Yeah.  I wouldn't -- so like we have enough time for a TV, then, with a little kid?
R:  No, me -- usually, we're outside playing in the dirt or -- or watching Wiggles, of all things.
L:  Oh, yeah?  Um, what's that type -- what is that show?  I never --
R:  Um, Wiggles is, like, four guys from Australia that sing these really stupid songs.
L:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH].
R:  And it's very engaging for kids 'cause it'll, you know, drive you pretty much insane after two or three times.
L:  Like the Barney thing?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Probably better than Barney, though, I would guess?
R:  Yeah.  I -- it's certainly better than Barney, but you know, it's -- it's --
L:  Mm.
R:  Guess that has nothing to do with sports though, does it?  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  No.  That's the whole thing, though.  I can't -- I'm trying hard to think of things about sports TV, but I'm like, um, if I watch some of it --
R:  Well, I mean, what other sports are there?  Let's see.  There's figure skating and uh --
L:  Mhm.  Hockey, I guess.  We watch a lot.  Like, I know a lot of people are really big into hockey up here, to like to watch it, they'll all want to watch the game.
R:  What kind of teams are -- do you have any teams?
L:  We have the Redwings here.
R:  Oh.  Oh, I guess they uh --
L:  Well, their last year was a pretty big deal.  Because we have the Stanley Cup and all that stuff, and --
R:  Oh, that's cool.  Yeah, I guess --
L:  And plus I -- I think hockey's big in Michigan just 'cause of the winter.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  A lot of people play.
R:  Sure.
L:  They get into it on TV and --
R:  Mm.
L:  Um --
R:  So do you ever go to sports arena games?  
L:  Um, I went to one football game at [inaudible] [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  And then um like little things like I go to Central Michigan.  It's --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- um -- I don't know, in the north a little bit, of Michigan.  In the middle north and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'll watch some of their stuff.  I was in the marching band so I had to sorta be there for it, but --
R:  I gotta go.  That's cool.
L:  Mm.  Yeah, that's all right.  Do you go to any sporting games?
R:  No, just once in a while for Chase.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  Hang on.  Hang on just a second.  Oh, man, God.
L:  [LAUGH].  Good timing?
R:  Yeah, he just -- blah, blah, blah.  It's like, I gotta go.  It's like, all right.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Um, hm.  Let's see.  Do you watch figure skating at all?
L:  Yeah.  Actually, I have a cousin who um was on -- she does figure skating for a living and um --
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, she's really young and she almost got in the Olympics.  She was, like -- she made the nationals and she was cut off.  They -- you know how they take two or something and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, she's a pair skater and she was the third.
R:  Really?
L:  Young, though.  She's only like -- I think she just turned eighteen, so she'll -- she has more time for to --
R:  Uh-huh.  Well, I know like a lot of the -- I like to watch figure skating, especially the Olympic stuff and a lot of them are really young.   It's like, dang --
L:  Oh, I know.  It's unbelievable.  They start 'em so young and they start really doing it seriously at, like -- they like -- I -- I know she can't go to high school, she hasn't got a high school.
R:  Oh.
L:  She home schools.  She gets up at practice -- for practice at, like, five thirty in the morning and --
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  But it's really cool.  Like, they get to -- she -- she sees the world and she's --
R:  Sure.
L:  And I mean, I know she made money.  I mean, I think as a sixteen year old, she was making, like, thirty six thousand dollars a year off figure skating.  I'm like --
R:  Really?  Was that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- off, like, royal -- or off winnings of --
L:  Um, I think that and like doing sponsor things.  I -- I'm not really sure.
R:  Oh.  Oh.
L:  I mean -- I know they do, like, side -- like, they'll do like side things on top of the competitions.
R:  Sure.
L:  I just -- really just a lot of skating, all year.  
R:  Huh.  I always wondered, you know, you know, what was -- you know, motivation, I guess for pushing herself that hard?  [LAUGH].
L:  Mm.  Oh, the dream --
R:  I'd be like "Ooh".
L:  Oh well, this is just a dream.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Hoping to be -- be a big winner and the fame or --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- because all of the -- a lot of Olympic stars now, they travel on those, like, they have Disney on Ice and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [inaudible].
R:  Yeah.  That's true.  Yeah.
L:  That's -- they're pretty neat.  
R:  Huh.
L:  The figure skating's really pretty to watch, too.
R:  Yeah, it is.  It's -- you got some really -- really gifted people that do that.
L:  I know.  I don't know how they do it, how she -- how they toss her up in the air, how she gets caught.  I mean, it's so scaring me, the whole idea of the -- the skates and ooh.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  Too much for me.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Almost far, far too much for me.  I like -- especially those extreme ones.  I don't know those people --
R:  'Cause a lot of people --
L:  -- do all those --
R:  -- are just stupid.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Let's do something and see if we can kill ourselves.
L:  I know.  But they look cool doing it.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, they do look cool doing it, but man, like, wow.
L:  Mhm.  It's --
R:  Yeah, like that certainly takes a lot of uh --
L:  Guts.
R:  A lot of guts to do something like that.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  Of course, I'm afraid of heights, so I can't even probably do --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- a quarter of the things that they -- they do.  I'd be peeing my pants.
L:  [LAUGH].  Oh, well I -- I don't know.  I think I wouldn't be able to do any of it either.  I think they're just so coordinated and I don't even know how they get to the point where they are.  Like, practice wise, you know they have to fall so much and I would just be, like, um, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- enough bro- broken bones, you know, enough of beating myself up.
R:  Yeah.  And I -- and when you think about it, you know, how many times did they, you know, fall down and blow out before they got it right?
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, real scary.  [MN].
R:  Yeah, that's where just leave it to them and I'll sit behind my desk and --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- you know, do my eight to five job [LAUGH] and --
L:  [LAUGH].  What is your job?
R:  I am a project manager for telecomm- in telecommunications.
L:  Oh.  Is that fun?
R:  Yeah, actually it is.  I do actually do a lot of traveling myself, so --
L:  Oh, cool.  
R:  Yeah.  I -- I really like the traveling, get to go to different places around the United States and I can pretty much select, um, when I want to um travel, you know?  So --
L:  Now, do --
R:  [inaudible].
L:  -- do you da- get to take your child?
R:  No.  He stays home with his dad.  
L:  Oh.  Okay.
R:  Yeah, he -- I -- that probably won't be a good thing.  I just got back from Texas, I took him on a -- we drove and that was -- that was difficult enough as it was.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  And when you -- you know, when you're on the road, you can't really um take him 'cause you gotta work and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- find someone to watch him, so --
L:  Oh, yeah.  I couldn't -- you'd have to have someone -- another person, a third person come with you.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  Oh, gosh.
R:  But probably it's nice taking -- you know, and have, you know, some time alone.
L:  Mhm.
R:  As much as you love your kids, you know, it's always nice to -- you know?
L:  Have a vacation from home?
R:  Get away from [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  Oh.
R:  I know it sounds bad.  It's like, oh, I need my sanity.
L:  No, I understand.  My parents always say the same thing.  [LAUGH]. 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
R:  So, what do you do?
L:  I'm uh a student, actually.  Um, I'm going to college for music and then I --
R:  Really?
L:  Yes, and then I have a summer job.  I work at -- um, I sell roses at concerts.  
R:  Oh, cool. 
L:  Yeah, it's really fun.  I just -- I -- we -- I do it all over Michigan and then I've also been in Chicago to sell, like the --
