L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  I'm Kara.
L:  I'm Kristi.
R:  Hi, Kristi.
L:  Hi.
R:  Um, okay, bioterrorism.  [MN]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I really don't think the US can do anything to prevent it.  I think we just need to be prepared for it. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I think just research.
R:  Um, um ...
L:  You know, keep researching things.
R:  [LIPSMACK] We are talking about a field that I was working in before I gave up my career to be a mommy --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and, um, [NOISE] like, bioterrorism is one of those things where research isn't gonna do a wh- whole lot to prevent it, it will just keep you prepared.
L:  Yeah.
R:  If there's some kind of --
L:  That makes sense.
R:  Um, you know, they're just gonna -- they're gonna do their be- -- the enemy is gonna do their best to try to have more education than ours normally[?] do which isn't really [LIPSMACK] gonna happen.  No matter what they do we're always gonna be a step ahead of 'em 'cause the country spends a lot of money on that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But ... I live in Atlanta and I think that we're prepared. The CDC has devoted a lot of time to -- and dollars, to making sure that we are, [MN] but I honestly d- -- I'm not scared of it 'cause I don't think anyone can, um, have more knowledge and information that we do.
L:  Yeah, but I -- I think that as long as we don't piss anybody off then we don't have anything to worry about, you know.
R:  Everybody hates this country though.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't think -- we -- we couldn't, like, you know, be completely silent and, um, do nothing and we'd still piss people off because we have more money and we have a better life or quality of life here than most of the world does and they're jealous.  I mean, it's just human nature.  
L:  [MN]
R:  So, it's --
L:  But it's also, like, we -- we make things hard on other countries too.  You know.
R:  [MN] I mean, I respectfully disagree with that.  I think we do as much as we can to help other countries.
L:  Well, we supplied Turkey with arms to, um, invade Kurdistan.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I think that we should stay of the military messes that these other countries create for themselves.  I -- I agree with that.  We definitely should stay out of their internal battles.  I don't think we have any business, you know, in the Middle East or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in Eastern Europe at all when it comes to their internal conflicts --
L:  Me neither.
R:  -- but, at the same time, you know, I'm not a big supporter of overseas humanitarian efforts [MN] either.  I think we need to keep our money here where the people in this country who need it need it and we shouldn't be supporting any kind of military or humanitarian efforts there.  That's for private --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- non profit organizations.  That's what the Red Cross is for.  That's what, you know, UNICEF is for.  You w- --
L:  Yeah, I agree with that because a lot of times the government doesn't, you know, they're gonna have their own sort of, you know, agendas anyway, you know what I mean, because --
R: Oh, yeah, definitely.
L:  -- e- every -- so, it's -- a lot of times it' not really helping them out anyway.
R:  Um, I'm -- I'm in a very high tax bracket so I -- I'm very much a supporter of keeping our humanitarian efforts in this country because I don't like to pay for welfare and I don't like to pay for all those things when [NOISE] if we hadn't sent so much money and military support and humanitarian support to countries who aren't grateful for it anyway then we probably wouldn't have so many people unemployed and so many people in this country and public assistance and whatnot because we'd have money here to educate the poor and help the homeless, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um ...
L:  Yeah, there's definitely not enough money in any of that, like, education --
R:  Oh, there isn't.
L:  -- or anything.  It's really sad 'cause I live in Philadelphia and it's just depressing to see what --
R:  Oh, I'm in Atlanta.
L:  -- what kind of schools these kids go to.
R:  Atlanta's -- ah, Georgia's schools are the worst in the country.  So ... [MN]
L:  Yeah.
R:  My daughter will not go to public schools in this co- -- in this state because it's -- it's just bad.  I mean, um, [LIPSMACK] the schools are -- and I'm -- I'm pretty -- I was gonna say pretty -- I'm very conservative and I'm a Republican and, you know, I -- but I think there's only so far you can go with foreign policy because, no -- I mean, look at France, for God's sake.  We bailed them out of being New Germany twice, and --
L:  Yeah, but, I mean, I still don't think you can hold a grudge against a country, you know what I mean?  Just like --
R:  They hold a grudge against us.
L:  -- oh, well, we did this for you, like, you should agree with us.  It's -- I think it's kind of, like, childish to -- to think that way.
R:  Well, but, my point is they're not grateful and you know -- I mean, any other countries that we free from oppression from dictators, that we, you know, give them humanitarian aid, none of them are grateful.  They expect it from us at this point, because we're the, quote, rich co- country.  They think that, you know, "Oh, the US is throwing out money.  Why don't we get some of it too?"  And I just -- I mean, I probably sound cold [MN] and like a terrible person because I don't want to help other people but I just think it'd be better spent in our own country on own citizens.  I mean ...
L:  Well, I think, yeah, I -- I agree with you on that point that we just need to stay out of other people's business, you know.  
R:  Like, I think with the whole Iraq thing, like you def- -- we definitely had to do something because that is one man, Saddam Hussein, that would come after this country and has said he intends to come after this country and something did have to be done about that man and unfortunately with people like that who place no value on the quality of human life there is only one way to do it, um, but, you know, that was directly threatening and affecting us.  The stuff, like, with Israel and Pales- -- with the Palestinians, that doesn't have any direct impact -- well, any direct harmful impact on us. Yes, you know, there's economic things but --
L:  Oh, yeah, definitely.
R:  -- but, you know, this country's very much about the economic things too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] but, I mean, if anyone was a serious threat with the bioterrorism it would have been Saddam Hussein.  You gotta do what you gotta do with him but ... I'm sorry, I'm probably out of breath because I'm unloading groceries and trying to watch my --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- daughter to make sure she doesn't harass my dog at the same time.  
L:  Mm.
R:  Um ... Emma, get off that dog.  He is going to bite you.  Stop teasing him. [NOISE] Oh, she's two. [MN]
L:  Are you from Atlanta?
R:  What?
L:  You don't have an accent at all.
R:  No, I'm from New York. [MN]
L:  Okay.  It didn't -- you don't s- --
R:  No, I just -- I live here.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah, I grew up, yeah, I- I've lost my New York accent for the most part.
L:  Yeah, 'cause I'm from Virginia, so, like --
R:  Yeah, I don't -- my husband has a twang.
L:  I don't have any sort of Virginian accent.  What?
R:  My husband has the twang and he's from New York too but he's picked it up.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- are you in Virginia?
L:  No, I'm in Philadelphia.
R:  Oh, that's right.  You said that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you -- you -- everybody there has an accent and you -- you're probably, like, pretty neutral.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  No, everyone's --
R:  Philadelphia's like --
L:  -- like, "Where are you from?  California?"  I'm, like, "No, actually, Virginia". [MN]
R:  Well, Virginia's a pretty neutral accent, like California.
L:  Well, there's parts, like, um, there's definitely different accents in different places.  Like, I'm from Virginia Beach and that's -- like, everyone talks real slow, like this, and, yeah, I managed to escape it. [MN]
R:  My husband's partner and his wife are from, like this, like, hillbilly town in, um, West Virginia -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they talk like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, very slow and, like, it takes you fifteen minutes to get a sentence --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- out of them.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Yes.
R:  And I'm from New York so I'm like [MN]. [MN]
L:  Are you from New York City?
R:  I'm from, upstate Westchester County.
L:  Okay.  Yeah.
R:  Um, I don't know, I guess, ah, to people in Buffalo its not really upstate but um, yeah, I'm from Westchester.  I grew up --
L:  That's right outside the city though, right?
R:  Well, yeah, about forty minutes.  I grew up about forty minutes from --
L:  Okay.
R:  I was pretty close.  My dad worked in the city when I grew up but, um, I'd love to be from the city but who can afford it, like, God.  It's , like, my -- I was just at a friend's house two weeks ago and he's paying almost three thousand dollars a month for a closet --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- on the upper east side.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And he's, like, almost in Harlem.
L:  [MN] Yeah, my friend lives in this, like, little one bedroom in Brooklyn for -- it's not bad.  It's, like, thirteen hundred.
R:  Brooklyn, ah, that's where, you know, h- his friend, my husband, I shouldn't say my friend -- my husband's friend is a -- a stockbroker and he -- he makes like two hundred thousand dollars a year and he's living in, like, this little shoe box on the upper east side but -- oop, you had an accident, didn't you, I'm sorry. [MN] My daughter, potty training.
L:  How old is she?
R:  She'll be two next month.
L:  Oh, cute.
R:  Ah, Emma, let's get your pants off.  They're wet.  Um --
L:  [MN] [LAUGH]
R:  I just -- [MN] I try not to, as far as the bioterrorism thing goes, I try not to, like, voice my opinion on that too much just because most people disagree with me --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- but just, ah, being in the field that I was in --
