R:  Hi, this is Heather.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  Uh, what's your name?
R:  Heather.
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  Heather.  
L:  Yes, I can't -- really can't hear well.  
R:  My name is Heather.
L:  Oh, Heather.  Okay, Heather.  This is Shirley.
R:  Hi, Shirley.
L:  Hi.  Um, so well it seems like the talk is uh is sports?
R:  Yes.
L:  Well, I'm not crazy about sports.  [LAUGH].
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH].  
L:  Mm.  Are you?
R:  Um, actually, I'm a big football fan.
L:  Really?
R:  Yes. 
L:  Oh.
R:  I like -- I like to watch, um pro football on TV.
L:  Oh.  I don't understand football.  I --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, I don't understand most of the games actually.
R:  Is there a one sport that you tend to like more than the others?
L:  Uh, well, I like you know, tennis.  Um, and I like baseball, but I really don't watch.  I just like it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Let's put it this way, I don't like TV as a matter of fact, so you know, if you talk anything about TV, it's hard for me too.  
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Have much to talk about, because I really don't like much TV.  I think it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think it's kind of a waste of time.  Um --
R:  Yeah, I um -- I really don't watch too much either.  I work during the day so by the time I get home, I'm usually, like, you know, trying to get stuff done I couldn't do during the day so I ah really don't have time to put on TV, but during football season because the games are on Sundays, um, usually make time on Sunday afternoons to watch them. 
L:  Right.
R:  But I'm glad the football season only runs, like, a couple months out of the year because [LAUGH] it frees a lot of the rest of the time, um, for other things.
L:  Right.  Yes, the only um sport that I like, I mean, really to -- really that I really would watch is soccer.  
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  And but I don't know, that's only like for the World Cup.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Other than that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- uh, not get --
R:  You don't get too much into the regular --
L:  Mm.  No.  
R:  -- stuff?
L:  Not even that.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  But um -- well, I mean, I guess that's as much as I can say about sports.  I mean, like, car racing, um --
R:  Oh, you like car racing?
L:  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  I love that.  
R:  Are you -- were you a big Dale Earnhardt fan?  
L:  Well, I -- I like it, but I'm kind of scared.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh [LAUGH].  You'd never do it yourself?
L:  Yeah well, it's you know, you see a lot of accidents.  I mean, a lot of um car racers, you know, died, you know?  While in the competitions, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think that's sad, but yes, ah, that's another sport that I find interesting.
R:  Yeah.  I have a lot of friends here into car racing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I'm trying -- actually, I'm dating somebody who's real into car racing and I'm trying to get more into it.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Oh, wow, that's interesting.
R:  Um, yeah, because he always has Nascar races on and so I -- I sit there and I watch it and I try and get more interested in it, but I find myself, like, getting up and walking out of the room --
L:  Mm, don't --
R:  -- like, ten or fifteen minutes into it. 
L:  Don't you get scared as well -- as well, then?
R:  Um, I do, but most -- most often it seems like whenever they -- whenever they have an accident, because they're so um -- because the cars are -- are, you know, they're like almost trapped in there with safety nets and stuff, it seems like, it seems like all the drivers who get into accidents usually end up just getting out of the car and walking away.  Because they're so protected in there.
L:  Oh, yes, but sometimes, you know, there are accidents that they really blow themself out --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you know?  And so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I [SIGH] it's kind of thrilling, but you know, still I don't like to see much.  I mean, see any -- if I see anything going um, you know, seem dangerous or whatever, I can't watch either.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I just --
R:  You find it hard.
L:  -- it -- yeah.  
R:  [COUGH].  Yeah.  
L:  So what about you?  What other sports do you like?
R:  Um, I like -- I -- I used to like baseball but um the -- the city I live in, the baseball team's not real good so I um -- I -- my -- my interest in baseball has weaned over the years.
L:  Mm.
R:  Just our -- our city baseball team is -- is never very good.  Um, I like -- I like um swimming, even though it's not really like a sport that you would watch on TV.
L:  [LAUGH].  
R:  Um --
L:  That's healthy.  That's a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- great thing to do.
R:  Exactly.  [LAUGH].
L:  That's --
R:  Exactly.  So --
L:  -- the best exercise you can get for your body.
R:  It'd kinda boring to watch on TV, but I guess I was a swimmer for a good many years so I kinda understand more about the sport and watching it on TV than maybe like the average person, but um -- and I also like gymnastics.  
L:  Mm.
R:  I can sit and watch gymnastics for hours.  
L:  What's that?
R:  Gymnastics?  
L:  Yeah?  Oh, gymnastics.
R:  It's --
L:  I'm sorry.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, gymnastics.
L:  Oh, gymnastics.  Okay.  Oh.  Well, yeah.  I -- ah -- I'll -- I think that that's -- for me, that's boring.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I think you need, you know, a lot of discipline for that and uh --
R:  Mhm.  [COUGH].
L:  -- I --
R:  Yeah.  My family, um, my -- a lot of my family and friends would -- would say the same thing.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  If I put gymnastics on, they'll always be the first to complain, so --
L:  Right.  Right.  Well --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but it seems like you have a good interest in sports in general, I mean, more than I do, since I --
R:  Well, it sounds like you have a um -- you have a broad interest in car racing and soccer, the tennis and --
L:  Well, yeah.  Then, like I said, it's -- I -- I like it, it doesn't mean I really don't get to watch that much, you know?  Again, I don't like TV, you know, it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, I don't have much time.  I mean, for me to watch TV, I have to be extremely bored.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I guess I get even more and more boring.  [LAUGH].
R:  More like sitting in a doctor's office, waiting to be seen by the doctor or something and TV happens --
L:  Yeah, right.  Oh, sometimes, you know, a good movie, but um, it's, you know, some -- like, I -- sometimes I like to watch --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- Three's Company, something like that, but uh --
R:  Yeah, I agree.  If I'm gonna watch TV, it's pro- it's most likely not going to be anything related to sport.
L:  Right.
R:  It's gonna be like a movie or a sitcom or something.
L:  Right, right.  Yeah, something you know light and uh --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  -- whatever, you know?  You can get up of -- turn the TV off and you can get out of your mind and um that's it.  I mean, nothing -- nothing special --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but you know, it's just -- I guess it's to relieve the stress or whatever it is that --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].  To get yourself into somebody else's problems for a while.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yes, it is.  That's -- that's what it is.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  So are you in Pennsylvania?  
R:  I'm in Pennsylvania, yes.
L:  Oh. 
R:  How about you?
L:  I'm in New York.
R:  Oh, okay.  What part of New York?
L:  Ah, New York City.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah, I'm asking yours because uh you know, I was just wondering if uh people all over the country are taking part on --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in this study.  
R:  Yeah, this -- I just found out about this today actually.
L:  Really?
R:  I just happened to be searching the internet and I came across this.
L:  Oh.  
R:  Thought it would be -- be pretty neat.  Now, do you only get, like, three phone calls, right?  
L:  Well, no, it seems like it depends -- I am not sure what it depends on, but depending on whatever, you may get up to twenty or twenty five or you may be invited, you know, to extend your participation.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  I'm not sure.  I mean, this is actually my second phone call and um, yes, I find it interesting actually.  More than I thought I would find.  Um, you know, I'm not even sure if I'm -- if I'm get anything for that because I didn't fully fill out all the -- you know, all the fields.  Um, but I know they got my name and phone number and that.  I think that was about that.  
R:  Yeah, and you got -- you get ten dollars for each phone call?  Is that how it works?
L:  Yeah, I'm not -- like I said, yeah, it should be, but I'm not sure if I would be getting anything actually because I didn't finish filling out my -- my application.  I didn't even --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- think they were going to call me and they -- you know, they actually they call, you know.  They are really good in calling the times that they say they are going to call.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  And um well, it's -- it's -- it's certainly interesting to talk somebody that you don't know about something that, you know, they choose the talk that given --
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  Um, seems like you're supposed to talk about that, you know, that mostly can, and um I wonder what kind of uh experiment is that or -- or research?  But anyway, so -- yeah.  It's sports, so I guess, you know, we should be [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.  Mm.
L:  We should confine ourselves, you know, confined to sports and um I guess they want to find out how long can you talk about whatever.  And um --
