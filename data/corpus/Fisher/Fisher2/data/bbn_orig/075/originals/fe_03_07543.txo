L:  [MN]
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Yes, my name is Sigrid Lucas.  Ah --
L:  My name is Caitlin.
R:  -- I live in Staten Island.
L:  [MN] I'm Caitlin Crook and I'm from Pennsylvania.
R:  Oh, hi.  How are you?
L:  I'm good.  How are you?
R:  Oh, pretty good.  Thank you.  Yes, um --
L:  So ...
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] it's a very interesting topic.  It's, ah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- one I guess people are thinking about a great deal.
L:  Definitely.
R:  Yes, and, ah, ah, I really sometimes wonder how the government can deal with that but, ah, you know, only through, um, inspections and so forth.  I think that, um, it's just, ah, an overwhelming problem.
L:  Yeah, definitely is.
R:  Mhm.  Yes.
L:  [NOISE] I don't know how, like, I guess prevention would be really hard since, I mean, so far with anthrax and everything --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- [MN] most of the time it's just too late when they --
R:  Mhm.  That's true.
L:  -- after they find it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's already too late.
R:  Yeah, and, ah, you know, even when we had the anthrax, I mean, it put quite a scare on everybody, I'm sure, you know, [MN]--
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- all through the country and, um, and I -- as far as I know, they haven't found the source really.  Ah, I could be wrong but I don't think they did find the source, have they?
L:  I don't think they did either.
R:  No, no, [LIPSMACK] and that's very frightening.
L:  I guess.
R:  I mean, if they couldn't find, like, you know, the connection with the anthrax, ah, scare and breakout then I, ah -- I wonder how they would manage in other areas such as an attack on New York and so forth, you know. [MN]
L:  Yeah, I was watching the news about the war and they had, like, they showed how they tested for all those, like, biological weapons that they had on -- in, um, in Iraq --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and it's such a -- like, the process is so tedious, like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to check all the chemicals --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and so many different things they have do to make sure it's safe and it's just, it's a shame [MN] --
R:  It is, isn't it?
L:  -- that -- that they have to do that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because of the threat.
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  It's so big.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  Well, you know, w- we don't know what the future holds with that.  You know, it's -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's very scary, especially, you know, like, with the smallpox and so forth and -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- and many other, ah, illnesses.
L:  [MN]
R:  I'm sure we -- we don't [LAUGH] -- in the future, you know, it's gonna be very --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- very difficult to live in a --
L:  I'm, like, when --
R:  Mm?
L:  When the movie, um, I don't know if you ever saw Outbreak but when I saw --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- that movie, it's -- it's about biological weapons and it scared me and, like, it, like it's -- it's scary because [MN] that could actually happen and, like, it -- it's -- I mean, it hasn't really gotten to that point obviously --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean --
R:  Yes.  
L:  -- but it could and --
R:  [COUGH] Oh, yes.
L:  -- it's -- it's scary to think that --
R:  What an awful thing to have to look forward to.  You know --
L:  I know.
R:  -- it seems as that -- that could be a reality and, ah, it's very, very difficult.  Yeah.
L:  [MN] You know, terrorists, like, they're always looking for new weapons and --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- like, we never know when an attack will happen --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like, I don't even know how prepared the government is.  I mean, I guess we can't know that much --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- since we're just --
R:  Right.
L:  -- general public --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- that in itself --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- is --
R:  Well ...
L:  -- makes me uncomfortable --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- a little bit.
R:  Yes.  I mean, look what happened in the World Trade Centre.  There wasn't very much, ah, preparedness --
L:  Right.
R:  -- there and, you know --
L:  And you're from New York, right?
R:  Yes.
L:  I mean, that must have been --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- really scary. [MN]
R:  Yeah.  And who knows, it takes them sometimes years to, from the first attack to the second attack, ah, it took, what was it, six, seven years, [LIPSMACK] you know, in -- in the World Trade Centre, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- who knows what the next, ah, couple of years will bring before they attack again and then, with the bioterrorism, that's, ah, definitely a -- a -- a very severe threat.
L:  Mm.  I mean, it's -- it's an invisible threat, like --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- you'd never know.
R:  And you never know, you know, you never know.
L:  It really --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, [LIPSMACK] I don't [MN] -- I don't think Sars is, like --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- a part of that.
R:  No.
L:  I mean, is that just something that sprung up by itself or ... 'cause I really haven't been keeping --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- up with that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, Sars, like, I don't -- I don't know if that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- was created or --
R:  No, I wonder.
L:  -- I mean, if that's a part of it --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- but ...
R:  Because, ah, I was just reading an article in the paper [COUGH] today where, ah, it was something about how all these viruses are coming out, all new ones, you know --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- from, ah --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- th- the first big one we had was, of course, AIDS, then we go down to, you know, now we have Sars.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Monkey pox and, ah --
L:  Oh, yeah, I heard about that.
R:  -- they mentioned a few others and they really don't know how to -- you know, they don't have anything for it, really --
L:  Yeah, it's just like it came up by itself.
R:  Yeah, and it's --
L:  Like with --
R:  -- they -- they just seem to crop up.  But it makes me wonder, you know --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- if that [MN] isn't, ah, part of the, ah, [MN] chemical --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- warfare.
L:  Right.
R:  I don't know.  It's just -- because there's so many recently that --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- are coming up and where do they come from?
L:  Yeah, that's what I wonder.
R:  Yeah.  That's, ah, you know ...
L:  And it -- it's going to be so long before there's any treatment or any, like, cure --
R:  Right.
L:  -- for AIDS and AIDS has --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- taken so many lives, like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I wonder if it's not some sort of, like --
R:  Yeah, created --
L:  -- I don't know, population control but I hope --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that's not what it is. [LAUGH]
R:  No.  My -- my goodness.  You know, there must be some -- i- it's really -- it's -- ah, these things are coming up so suddenly and from out of nowhere and I -- I just can't believe that, you know, because we didn't have anything like that years ago. [MN]
L:  I know.
R:  You know, [MN] if we had one thing, you know, ah --
L:  Yeah, like --
R:  -- it took a while, they found a cure and, ah, then there were just your natural viruses or your flus or whatever and now it just seems as though it's one thing after the other and so close.
L:  They're life threatening too.
R:  You know, yes.
L:  Very.
R:  They're so close together, all these things are coming.  You know, there's almost no period of time in between.  They just, you know, months aw- -- apart.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And vaccines, we know, they're not always gonna be, um, effective.  Like, I know with influenza --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- that a lot of the bacterias are becoming, um, resistant to --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- antibiotics.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know if that is, like, on topic or anything but, like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that could happen with, like, if they can, I mean, whenever they develop, um, [LIPSMACK] vaccines for these biochemicals, like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they may not even be effective for a long --
R:  No, no.
L:  -- time, like.
R:  No, that's right.  And, ah, we've built up such an immune system to, you know, these vaccines --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that we've already had [MN] that, ah, I mean, they -- they give it -- they start with children and they give it for every- everything, every little, you know, sore --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- throat, whatever.
L:  [MN]
R:  So, ah, it does- --
L:  Ah, they're overused. [MN]
R:  They're overused so, they're no good to, you know, most people now, you know.
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
L:  They're -- they just have to keep coming up with more --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- ways --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- scientific ways to ...
R:  It's -- it's scary.  It makes you feel like they're almost gonna run out of everything, you know. [MN]
L:  I know, like --
R:  It's gonna take so long to --
L:  It's gonna take a lot of really smart people --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to address --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- the problem --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because I, um -- I'm not very educated on it and I --
R:  Yes, well ...
L:  I mean --
R:  Most people --
L:  -- I learned some of -- I have -- I have had, like, biology classes in college and --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- it's very confusing.  I mean --
R:  Yes, yes, indeed.
L:  [MN]
R:  But they've -- you know, really have to work at it.  I'm sure they are, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with all these [inaudible] things and then on top of it is, ah, who knows where they come from?  You know.
L:  [MN] Yeah --
R:  [several inaudible words] 
L:  -- it's just amazing to me that they -- the people that are -- the terrorist groups, I mean, they are really intelligent people [MN] --
R:  Oh, yes, they are.
L:  -- because it's -- I mean, A- Americans probably take it f- -- like, look at them as being, like, less educated and everything else.  They're really not.  Like, they're very smart people --
R:  Oh, they are.
L:  -- and they know what they're doing.  I mean, they --
R:  They're way ahead in schools over there, those cou- -- ah, you know, those particular countries, ah, they -- they really, really, ah, ah, teach them everything --
L:  Right.
R:  -- when they're little and then they go into these camps --
L:  Right, yeah. [MN]
R:  -- and then they are taught and they become just experts at it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- whatever --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- they do and -- and they're right here in this country, you know.
L:  I know, that's scary to me.
R:  Yeah, what do they say?  The enemy within.  So, with bioterrorism it wouldn't be too difficult, you know.
L:  Right, it really wouldn't.
R:  No, no, no.
L:  And then, ev- --
R:  And then we have to sit here and then wonder about it and then eventually something, God forbid, will happen, you know. 
L:  Yeah, it's just a matter of time.  It's not really --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- a matter of if --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- any more.
R:  Mhm.  That's -- that's true.
L:  They're probably just gonna keep -- keep at it and there's really nothing -- I mean, we're fighting an enemy that's already --
R:  Right here.
L:  -- over here.  [MN]
R:  Yeah.  Ab- -- no, they -- they certainly are --
L:  So ...
R:  -- and they're situated in --
