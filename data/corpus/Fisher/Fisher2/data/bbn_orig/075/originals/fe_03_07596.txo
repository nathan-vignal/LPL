L:  Hello.
R:  Hello, my name's Vince.
L:  Hi Vince, my name is Lauren.
R:  Hi Lauren.
L:  How are you today?
R:  Good.  How are you?
L:  Okay.  What is your fa- -- 
R:  Interesting question about sports, huh?
L:  Uh-huh.  I think it's neat.
R:  Yeah.  I hear you.  You know, in my case it depends on the season but I probably spend at least, uh, a couple, three hours a week watching sports.
L:  I spend about eight hours a week watching auto racing on television.
R:  Argh.
L:  And I spend every waking hour of my life with auto racing.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Is that right?
L:  Yes.
R:  Well, this is your season is it not?
L:  Yes, it is.
R:  Ah.
L:  I am the business manager for my husband's professional racing team so --
R:  Oh, my gosh!  That'll do it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's exciting.
L:  Yeah, so, we watch all the +nascar on TV.  We watch all the Nascar, we watch all the AFA.  So, we had to get the satellite dish so --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- we could get the feed vision and the FX so ...
R:  Argh.
L:  What are your sports?
R:  [NOISE] Well, that's gonna -- be quiet -- my dog down here.  Typically I'm a big NFL fan.  I get the NFL tickets so --
L:  Oh, really.
R:  -- when the football season's in, I'm watching all the games.  And, uh, my hockey season just ended so, that kinda slowed down a bit.  But not a big golf watcher 'cause I kinda fall asleep but --
L:  You can't watch golf. [LAUGH]
R:  It -- no, but it's funny, I just recently started getting into watching some racing because, um, some people at work are --
L:  Really?
R:  -- are, uh, have kinda turned me on to it.  'Cause I just moved down here to Georgia and I guess it's very big in these parts.
L:  Okay.  Yeah, it is, very much so.  Tell them to get a Nascar board going.
R:  Well, it's funny you mentioned that; this, uh, gentlemen, Joe Pearson, I work with has been talking about that.  The most exciting thing he told me he got involved with, ah, with auto racing was I guess he did some -- something his wife had bought him for his birthday.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That he actually got in a car and followed a -- a driver on a track.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I guess it's some, um, promotion or something like that -- he says the most exciting thing he's ever done; he's got to do it again.
L:  [LAUGH] Kodak's having a special right now, you can pick up forms, um, at, like, major retailers like More Mart[?] and at their one hour photo labs and you fill it out and they're giving away a free four day, three night, um, driving school.
R:  Really?
L:  Um, [NOISE] va- vacation and it's, uh, one of the speedways I'm looking at here is Atlanta Motor Speedway.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yes.  So, you get three da- -- you get four days, three nights, your hotel and airfare.  And you actually go to driving school, um, and you race the actual Kodak car.
R:  Oh, my gosh!
L:  Yeah.
R:  I could hit, Joe, up tomorrow at work about that one.
L:  [LAUGH] How did you hear about the Penn study?
R:  Well, my wife was, um, [LIPSMACK] I think she found something online that had, um, gotten her interest.
L:  Is s- -- is she a mystery shopper?
R:  Ah, yes, she is.
L:  So am I.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  I own my own company.
R:  And she's just not home tonight so, I feel I answer the phone --
L:  There you go.
R:  -- and every now and again.
L:   Yeah, I own my own company and that's how I heard about it.   I've been doing -- probably answering Penn calls for about three months now.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah,
R:  Argh.
L:  It's kinda fun.  You get to speak to different people and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- discuss different things so, I -- I kinda like it.
R:  Is it -- is it a survey type thing?  I mean how do they --
L:  No, actually it's a study on how people, strangers inter react as far as, um, communication and -- and --
R:  Argh.
L:  -- you know, how they talk to one another.  It -- it's a college program.  The students are conducting this study through the -- the university. 
R:  Did not know that.
L:  And -- yeah.
R:  Interesting.
L:  It's kinda like the prescription [NOISE] drug companies, you know, test out a new drug over ten years and they're able to print all the problems out.  That's what, you know, this is one of those -- it's a sociology, psychology type program.
R:  Argh.
L:  And I'm from the East Coast and, you know, [NOISE] the University of Pennsylvania was, like, a stomping ground for [LAUGH] me, ah --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- in my college years so, I kind of -- kind of felt the kinship to it.
R:  Interesting.  Yeah, I, um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- my wife and I were from the northeast originally as a matter of fact --
L:  Where at? [NOISE] 
R:  She's from New Jersey.
L:  We, uh, so am I. 
R:  Union County, a town called Cranford.
L:  I was born in Elizabeth.
R:  Oh, my gosh.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.  That's where her dad grew up.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And originally I'm from Long Island so, uh --
L:  Well, I was born in St Elizabeth hospital --
R:  Argh.  I know right where it is.
L:  -- and, um, my family is from, uh, Marine Park, Brooklyn.
R:  Okay.
L:  And I went to college in Manhattan and simultaneously throughout all of my childhood, we've always had a couple of homes down on the Jersey shore.
R:  Uh, as a matter of fact --
L:  Uh, Longbranch, Belmar and --
R:  Oh, gosh.  Well, you've heard of the town Brick?
L:  Uh, my sister in law lives in Brick right now.
R:  That's where we moved from, down here to Acworth, Georgia.
L:  Well, this'll kind of tickle you because I graduated from Brick township high school.
R:  Come on!
L:  Right across from the library --
R:  The green dragons.  Yeah.
L:  The old school.  The old school, yeah.  I got a couple of B.'s.  [LAUGH]
R:  Look at that.
L:  The new school -- the memorial school was gong up the year I graduated.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, I was, you know, I went to the old school.
R:  Y- -- talk about hockey, they're hockey powerhouses.
L:  Yes.  Uh, skating rink right there down the street. I mean, we wee always there and a couple of times our graduating class, we went to a couple of, uh, Flyers' games out in Philadelphia.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, yeah, I was a big hockey fan back then.
R:  Yeah, talk about hockey, my son, he's, uh, eight years old --
L:  Is he?
R:  -- we miss it because he used to play a lot at the Ocean Ice Rink.  My wife was a skating pro as a matter of fact.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And we kinda left it all behind when we came here.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  They don't do much skating but I tell you, we used to, living in Brick, we used to just go due west to Trenton to watch the Trenton Titans play --
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  -- which I think is a Flyers form team.
L:  Right.
R:  And, uh, for, like, twenty dollars you can get two tickets, hotdogs, a couple of drinks --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and parking.
L:  Yeah,
R:  And, uh --
L:  My, uh, I first learned how to ice skate at the rink there in Brick when I was a little girl.
R:  Ocean Ice Palance?
L:  Yep.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I've -- gosh I remember, I can see it in my head and I think it was, like, my third trip out there I split the back of my head open.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my Gosh!
L:  And never went back on the ice rink again.
R:  I don't blame you.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Man, oh, man.
L:  What a small world.
R:  Isn't it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, you mentioned Brooklyn, now that's where my family's from so, I grew up in -- in Suffolk County, Long Island.
L:  Right.
R:  And my mom and dad, they grew up in Brooklyn and I think they moved out right after they'd gotten married.  And that's where my whole family is now.  They're all in --
L:  Oh, my goodness!
R:  -- Eastern Long Island.
L:  Well, that -- that's a very heavily do- uh -- dominated sport area up there.  Although auto racing isn't as popular 'cause there's no major tracks.  
R:  Yeah, I was gong to ask you that.   
L:  But you do have Dover.
R:  Is that why?
L:  You have Dover.  Um --
R:  Okay, when  -- Dover, right.
L:  -- yeah, you know.  And -- and then -- and there is, you know, um, [LIPSMACK] oh, goodness -- yeah, there's Dover and then I think there's one up in Vermont.  Um, you have a lot of local tracks like Wall[?] township --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- had a local track and that's a -- 
R:  Yeah, I know right where that is.
L:  -- that's a dirt track and a lot of modified, um, lot of more lo- -- it's more local, uh, drivers than professional.  And then they go south to go professional.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Now here we have Michigan International Speedway.  Well, it -- when I lived out in Arizona that's when the -- that's where the door[?] lube[?] is held in Phoenix.
R:  Argh.
L:  Um, then there's the [several inaudible words] California, and I've traveled all over so, I mean, racing is kind of, like, in my blood.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, I've been ever- -- with my -- so, I used to take my son to every single track, every year when he was little.
R:  Boy oh boy.
L:  He swore up and down he was going to be Ernie Irving's[?] racecar fa- --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- uh, m- -- pit mechanic.  But, um --
R:  How long's your husband been racing?
L:  He, um, he originally was, um, many years ago before I met him --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- was very heavily involved with drugs and alcohol --
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  -- and he wound up going to jail.
R:  Really?
L:  And when he got out he needed a place to channel his addiction and he chose stock car racing and --
R:  Oh, wow!  [LAUGH]
L:  -- now that's what he does.  Uh, he's been clean and sober for over six years now --
R:  God bless him.
L:  -- and he is a fantastic driver.  It's like he was born with a gift.  And --
R:  Talk about an adrenalin rush though, huh?
L:  Yes.  Yes.  I'm very proud of him.  I mean, I'm very proud of him.  There's several people that just go back to the old ways when things get tough, and instead he goes to the track.
R:  Wow!  Is that very expensive, uh, profession?
L:  Very expensive.  Very expensive.  We just picked up a sponsor out of California, um, for, you know, four or five grand and -- just to sponsor the hood.
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] wow!
L:  And, you know, the whole car is sponsored by different businesses so, it's very expensive.  You know, it's four hundred dollars a week in tires and --
R:  Ooh!  
L:  -- you know, about eighty dollars a week in pit passes.  And, you know, we pay for all of our pit crew to get in.  And, yeah, it gets very expensive.
R:  Man, oh, man!
L:  So, ah, you know, it's actually a business.  It's not -- it's just -- you know, I re- -- yeah, it's a passion and it's a hobby --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but, I mean, it's actually a business, because of all the expenses that go into it.
R:  So, who does all the, um, recruiting of sponsors?
L:  Me.
R:  That's hard work.
L:  I'm the marketing analyst, yeah.
R:  I was going to say, you must be a good salesperson.
L:  Sales and advertising and -- actually I'm not a good salesperson 'cause I don't like to lie.  I'm just really good --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and +keep following through with what I promise.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, that's important.
L:  Yes, I think so.  I have my own mystery shopping company so, that's my job.
R:  Argh.
L:  So, it's ...
R:  You know, y- y- -- my wife's explained it to me, she does it very part time.
L:  Right.
R:  But --
L:  That's how I got started --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, originally I was a single parent and I wanted to be able to take my son on vacations or take him out to dinner, or buy him a tee shirt at the Gap or something, and that's how it go- -- how it got start.
R:  Ooh.
L:  But for the most part now it's, like, my fulltime job.  I work two days a week and that's it.
R:  And you just hire companies -- find companies that hire you to shop there.
L:  Pretty much.  Um, actually did a major, um, companies online, like, what your wife is working with and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- some that I still work with.  They deal with the major big corporations -- s- -- you know, many Wal-Marts and many, um, AutoZones and stuff.  You know, people that -- companies that have a lot of volume.
R:  Right.
L:  That's where they can make their money.  Me, I decided that, you know, that's all well and good, but nobody targets the little guys, you know, the guy that only has two or three car washes --
R:  Argh.
L:  -- and he wants to know how things are going.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I handle the whole southwestern area of Michigan and the northern part of Indiana --
R:  Oh, boy!
L:  -- and I have all the little mini businesses.
R:  Now is there really a lot of money to be made in that though?
L:  Yeah, I make probably about three grand a month.
R:  Come on!
