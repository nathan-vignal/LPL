L:  Are those -- are really big?
R:  Excuse me? 
L:  Like, is basketball bigger or football?
R:  Mm, I don't know.  Basketball's bigger at my house.
L:  Oh, really?

L:  Um, is it a big household?
R:  My household?
L:  Mhm?
R:  Just, uh -- I have uh my husband and I have two daughters and a grandson.
L:  Wow.  Yeah, there's only me and my parents, so --
R:  Oh.  How old are you?

R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I'm at college, yeah [LAUGH].
R:  Okay.  Well, I'm forty two, so --
L:  Well [LAUGH].
R:  -- I'm not into a lot of sports, though.  
L:  Um, do you go jogging?
R:  Um, actually, I work out three times a week.  
L:  Oh, aerobics?
R:  Huh?
L:  Aerobics?
R:  No, I go to Curves for women.  
L:  What is that?
R:  It's where you uh -- you work out on different machines and jog.  It's a --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- thirty minute workout, uh, regimen.  
L:  Is it uh especially designed for like -- like, they tell you what to do?
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  You spend -- they have, like, ten machines with --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- jogging platforms in between and you spend thirty seconds on each machine and you do three rounds. 
L:  Wow, you're pretty --
R:  So I started doing that a few weeks ago.
L:  I wanted to go to the gym but it -- I don't know, it's hard to get the motivation to really, like, to really work out.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, it's something you kinda have to plan for and go, but like it's a pretty good stress reducer.  
L:  Yeah, so uh --
R:  So --
L:  -- I think, uh, playing tennis is good stress re- uh, reducer.
R:  Yeah?  It probably is.  I don't -- I don't watch much tennis.  I -- 
L:  Do you um --
R:  -- I like golf sometimes.  I like to watch 'em play golf.  My husband plays golf.
L:  Do you play?
R:  Uh, I have before, but not real good.  [LAUGH].  I'm not real good at any sports.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, I'm --
R:  But I don't mind watching it.
L:  Do you watch golf?  I think that's pretty boring [LAUGH].
R:  I actually do like to watch golf.
L:  Really?
R:  It's one of the few things I like to watch.
L:  Where -- where are you, in Michigan?
R:  At Kansas.
L:  Kansas?
R:  Yes, and my daughter used to play soccer, so I enjoy professional soccer teams also.
L:  Wow.  So you watch a lot.
R:  Not a whole lot.  I mean, only if there's nothing else on T.V.
L:  Like, Kansas, is that um in the middle?
R:  Uh-huh, it's --
L:  Or --
R:  -- right north of uh -- between Oklahoma and Nebraska.  Kind of in the Midwest.
L:  Oh.  Wow.  Is there anything fun to do there?
R:  Oh, there's lots of fun stuff to do here.  
L:  Really?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I would like to travel and visit, like, every State, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  What's the fun --
R:  I've only been to California a couple times, San Diego and San Francisco.  And San Leandro. 
L:  Oh, did you visit the, uh, colleges there?  I go to Berkeley.  
R:  Oh, no, I didn't.  I was there on business.  I travel some for business.
L:  Oh, what do you work as?
R:  I work at a bank here in town.
L:  Ah, Bank of America?  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, no, no, no.  Big competitor.  I actually work for the largest family owned bank in the State of Kansas.
L:  Wow.
R:  So it's about a six billion dollar bank.  Not near as big as uh B of A.
L:  Of course.  So, what college --
R:  So but they're one of our biggest competitors.
L:  Well, that means it's pretty big, if you have to compete with them.
R:  Yeah, but they're in so many different States.  We're only in Kansas and Oklahoma.  
L:  Oh, I see.  I see.  Oh.  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  So is this your uh first call?
R:  No.  It -- I've had three or four of 'em.
L:  You can have three?  I mean, you can have four?  I thought it ends up three?
R:  Oh, no.  I've done several of them.  
L:  Um --
R:  So --
L:  -- did you get paid for -- I'm just wondering?
R:  Ah, I've been paid for one.  I just did another one last week.  So --
L:  You -- really?
R:  -- they call me all the time.  I've missed probably six or seven of 'em.  I'll hear them on the answering machine or something.
L:  Me, too, but um they do pay you?  Is it, like, on a monthly thing?
R:  I don't know.  I'm not sure. 
L:  Okay.
R:  I'm not sure how it works.
L:  'Cause I haven't -- I haven't gotten anything so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I was jus wondering.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, okay [LAUGH].
R:  Well, expect something now.  'Cause --
L:  Um --
R:  -- I've done a couple of them, but --
L:  Actually, I had the same -- this is the same topic --
R:  Had?
L:  -- that I have had, yeah.  
R:  You had the same --
L:  Just for --
R:  -- topic before?
L:  Yeah, so I kinda talked about this for a while [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.
L:  So like, actually three -- like, all three of my topics were kind of similar so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- it's like --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- oh, not again.
R:  Well, this is my first one on sports.  Most of the time, um, nobody else joins the conversation, so --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  I'll wait for a little while and then I'll hang up.
L:  Actually, isn't this like a national -- like, all through --
R:  I'm not -- I'm not sure.  I just signed up for it off a website I get to sometimes.
L:  Ah, you mean the [inaudible] Fisher platform or something?
R:  No, actually that wasn't it.  Well, it -- it was, but I'd heard about it from a friend.  So --
L:  Oh, wow.  
R:  But --
L:  I didn't know it was so big.  I think it's really interesting.  I got to talk to, like, some people from other States.  
R:  Yeah, it -- it has been interesting.  I think the last lady I talked to was from Georgia.  So --
L:  From Georgia?  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Was it an interesting topic?
R:  Um, I think it was just about family.
L:  Family?  I could talk about family for a long time.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].  But we have to talk about sports, so let's see.  What else --
L:  Boring topic [LAUGH].
R:  -- can we talk about sports, yeah?
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Not -- not my favorite topic --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- and I don't know much about it.
L:  [LAUGH].  
R:  So --
L:  I'm not too good at it.  I mean, I'm really lazy --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- now.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  [LAUGH].  And, like, when --
R:  So --
L:  -- school starts, I don't do anything.  We all just study.
R:  You don't do any kind of sports or anything?
L:  I do.  I mean, I try, but like, when the studying --
R:  Just the -- 
L:  -- studying gets hard, I just ah -- like, finals time.
R:  Uh-huh.  What -- what are you majoring in?
L:  Um, I'm uh trying to double in uh psychology and biology.
R:  Oh, well cool.  What do you want to be when you grow up?
L:  Um, be a pharmacist.
R:  Oh.  That'll be neat.  
L:  Yeah.  Not the most exciting job, but it gets paid very well.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I didn't --
L:  So yeah --
R:  I didn't go to college so I just -- it took me a long time to get to where I'm at.
L:  Do you feel like you missed out?
R:  No.  I mean, I'm a vice president of a large corporation, so I have forty --
L:  They --
R:  -- people working for me so I don't think I missed out too much.
L:  But was it, like, a really long and tough road?
R:  Um, I've been with the bank for fifteen years.  But I've been in --
L:  Um, how long -- how long have you been a vice president?
R:  Um, well, it depends on which time you count.
L:  [MN].
R:  Um, I've been a vice president this time for two years.  I was an assistant vice president for six, and before that, I was a vice president for three or four years.  So --
L:  Do you think it was hard, though?  Like, without a college degree?
R:  No.  
L:  Really?
R:  Because even if you had a degree, you wouldn't know everything that you need to know.  I mean, I took a lot of stuff in high school and it doesn't always pertain to what you end up doing.  You still to be --
L:  It's true.
R:  -- trained and -- I mean, I -- I want my kids to go to college.
L:  Well, but the thing is, it's like people give like, uh -- like, an advantage to people with degrees, right?  College degrees?
R:  Um, I don't when I hire people.
L:  Really?
R:  I look for their skills and their work experience and what their uh references are and more stuff --
L:  So you would rather --
R:  like that.
L:  -- hire -- hire someone with, like --
R:  I didn't say I would rather.  I look at their -- I look at their skills and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- what they have and --
L:  What if someone graduated from a good college but um they didn't have any experience?
R:  Most time in the jobs that I hire for, they need to have banking experience.  
L:  Oh.
R:  So --
L:  So it's kinda tough?
R:  Because we deal with a lot of money.  I'm -- I manage our wire transfer department and we wire out four hundred billion dollars a month.  And I also manage our commercial cash vault and so it helps --
L:  So --
R:  -- to have cash handling experience.  Um, out of the forty people that work for me, probably only three of them have any college education.  
L:  Wow.  
R:  So --
L:  So I guess it's more important for me to get a job right now?
R:  Well, yeah.  But sometimes it just takes -- I think it just takes longer.  
L:  Uh, without a college degree?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But either way, if you get to the same place --
R:  Eventually.
L:  Really?
R:  Eventually.
L:  Oh, you're um -- where are your kids going right now?
R:  Excuse me?
L:  Are they going to college?
R:  Um, I -- my dau- one daughter is thirteen and my other daughter is twenty and she works at the same bank I do.  She works in our bankcard department.  And she's the one --
L:  Um, is she --
R:  -- that has the baby and she dropped out of college after her first semester.  When she was pregnant --
L:  Did you --
R:  -- so --
L:  Oh.  Did you want her to stay?
R:  Stay in college?  
L:  Mhm?
R:  Absolutely.  [LAUGH].  But that's just not the way it worked out, so --
L:  Well, she could've done --
R:  So --
L:  -- a community college, right?
R:  She -- yeah, she was.  She was in a community college, but it was too hard for her to work and have a baby and um go to college all at the same time, so --
L:  Wow.  I've never --
R:  That's what -- I'm playing with him right now.
L:  Really?
R:  He's playing with his ball.
L:  I've never -- never thought of not going to college --
