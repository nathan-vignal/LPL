L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  I'm Karl.
R:  I'm Mary Lou.
L:  Where are you from?
R:  Um, I'm from Michigan.  How 'bout --
L:  Michigan?
R:  Yeah.  How about you?
L:  And I'm in Louisiana. 
R:  Oh, my!
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Nice [several inaudible words]. 
L:  I'm doing pretty good.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
L:  So ...
R:  Nice and warm down there?
L:  Uh, y- -- warm and muggy and raining.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Well, we got the rainy part.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  We've had an awful lot of rain this -- this, uh, spring.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, we --
R:  Well, do you have favorite sport on TV?
L:  Um, I'm not too much of a sports fella.  I mean, put it this way, I like sports, but rather than watch it, I like to participate in it.  I mean --
R:  Oh, do you?
L:  -- I'm an old fella, I'm sixty three but, uh, I -- I still, you know, I don't like to sit and watch people have fun, I like to be doing it.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's cool. What kind of sports do you like?
L:  Uh, I like, well, mostly hunting.  But it's not too many like the football type, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- sports that I like.  Uh, if I'm at somebody's house, I'll sit down if they're watching 'em, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and watch with 'em.  But I don't -- I don't stay home to watch it myself.
R:  Right.  Well --
L:  How do you feel about it?
R:  Well, actually I'm not a big sports lover myself either.  A- -- at -- at least not for watching them on TV.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I grew up on hockey but -- Detroit is a big hockey town.
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  Yeah.  And, um, [LIPSMACK] we have the Red Wings here and if they're, you know, doing really, really well and they get in the playoffs and stuff, then we'll have, the -- the -- you know, the, ah, playoff games on and stuff on TV, mainly 'cause my family won't, you know, let me live it down if I don't watch it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But [LAUGH] 'cause they're all big, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- sports fanatics.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, I don't watch that much sports on TV otherwise.  Um, you know, but hockey I guess is -- it, you know, I just grew up on it.  I mean, my brother --
L:  Right.
R:  -- plays and -- and, um, you know, we always watched the reveling from where -- when we were growing up.  And we went to butterick[?] games and stuff.  But, um I don't watch that much of it any more.  It got too violent.  And a lot of the sporting events, you know, they got, you know, fighting was more than the game and --
L:  I think that's what some people watch it for. 
R:  Uh, exactly.  Yeah, and, um, I -- that's why I got away from hockey.  I mean, I used to watch it quite a bit but, um, when they started getting into fighting --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- ah, you know, and pulling their shirts off and -- and, you know, every -- everybody was encouraging that.  It just got to be [LIPSMACK] um, I thought they lost the sport in it.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  And so, that -- that's when I kind of started turning it off.  And as far as football goes, ah, you can have it.  You know, I'm -- I think the season's too long they -- they have it on TV and everywhere you go.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, tha- that's what I feel 'cause on the weekends when I do watch TV, you know, usually --
R:  Mm. 
L:  -- I -- you turn the TV on and even though I got a few cable channels, it seems like --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- that's all you see is racing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- football, or some kind of sport and --
R:  Oh, it is.  I mean --
L:  -- you know --
R:  -- on the netwo- network television that's all you can find in the afternoon --
L:  -- and --
R:  -- and early evening and, uh, it screws up your evening, you know, regular television --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- shows.  And, um, you know, if we go out to my in laws or something for dinner, they always have football game or basketball game or hockey game, something's on TV.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Which I think is rude but, you know --
L:  Right.  I know.
R:  -- but, you know, the guys like it and, you know, it's just, argh, I don't know too much.  And wrestling, you know, the -- the kids and my son used to love the wrestling --
L:  And I -- I think a lot of that's just acting, you know.
R:  It is.
L:  But [inaudible] --
R:  Oh, it is.  It -- it's a big show but --
L:  I -- I just feel, um, people can't take that beating and stand up and fight some more, you know, [LAUGH] the way --
R:  I know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- the things they do to, you know. 
R:  Oh, I know.  They've built a big story line around it now and, um, it's funny.  I mean, some of it's really funny --
L:  Yeah.  It's almost a joke.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  It is a joke.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, you know, they have that on TV and I, you know, it's funny because when I was growing up we used to -- it was almost, um, [LIPSMACK] every Saturday my dad would sit down and watch bowling on TV.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, they had -- I'm trying to think of what it was called but it -- it was really [inaudible] it was really kind of good, we used to w- -- follow it all the time.  Even after my husband and I got married -- and we were bowlers, I mean, we went out and bowled on a couple of leagues --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and stuff but, uh, we always watched this on Saturday afternoons and, um, it was just like watching golfing or something.  That's another boring sport.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] That's a -- 
R:  People watch golfing on --
L:  -- I just --
R:  -- TV, I mean, ho hum.
L:  Yeah.  Really.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Hit a ball and ...
R:  I know.
L:  No.  No, I mean -- 
R:  People just kind of stand there and ball flies in the air, you know.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- boring!  [LAUGH] 
L:  But, uh, there's people making big money in it.  In fact that's -- that's another thing I think, thes- -- some of these players, they get way more money than --
R:  Oh, yeah. 
L:  -- um, you know, that -- than it calls for, you know, I mean --
R:  Well sure.
L:  And they in turn, you know, they have to charge higher to see a game, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, uh --
R:  Well, yeah -- I put it --
L:  -- but that's unreal to me.
R:  It took the sport out of the sport also.
L:  [MN]
R:  I mean, you know, like, I'm sure when you were growing up, you -- you got a, um, you know, a bat and a -- and a ball and you went out with your friends to a field and you just --
L:  Right.
R:  -- hit the ball round and played it, you know, pick up game of ball and that was fun.
L:  Right.  Exactly.
R:  Yeah, and that -- that's what we did too.  And to me that's baseball.  What they've got out there now with all those professionals making millions of dollars and stuff; that's, you know --
L:  A racket I think.
R:  It is.  [LAUGH] It really is.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, I mean, in Detroit they built a new stadium, um, [LIPSMACK] oh, it opened two years ago and all the, you know, they didn't need a new stadium; there was nothing wrong with the old stadium.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- except that the new stadium could accommodate, um, [LIPSMACK] more seats that were -- that they could charge more money for.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And, um, you know, the back seats are thirty dollars and the better back seats are sixty dollars --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- if you can believe that.  And it's just outrageous.  You know --
L:  Th- that is.  That -- 
R:  -- they've lost their baseball games. 
L:  Uh.
R:  So, we don't go.
L:  And the -- probably the taxpayers have to buy the thing.
R:  Oh, oh, you betcha.  You betcha.
L:  And then somebody's reaping in all those profits.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, I mean, they just took the sport out of the sport as far as I'm concerned. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, it's -- it's, um, I -- I would rather watch a- amateurs. And when I watch the Olympics, um, I don't think they should pe- -- per- -- uh, allow professional people into the Olympics.  I think they should all be amateurs and keep amateur status because then you're seeing the real sport.  You're not seeing people there doing it for the money. You're seeing people doing it there for the sport.
L:  That's exactly right and -- 'cause that's it, I will watch the Olympics -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- some -- some things on the Olympics --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- 'cause I think there's more competition and that it's -- I think it's much more interesting than these professional --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- things, you know.
R:  Absolutely.  I agree.
L:  These the people that is -- have s- -- worked hard to get, you know, get in the Olympics and -- and I don't know, I just think that that's more sport than -- than money, you know.
R:  Yeah.  It really is.  It really is.  Um, it's enjoyable and those people have not been spoiled yet by the money.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  You know, maybe later --
L:  And greed.
R:  -- but -- but, uh, not yet.  And, uh, it's good competition.  So, that -- that part I enjoy watching but this other stuff, um, I can't really think of any sport I really enjoy watching too much any more.  Maybe an occasional basketball game but, um only if it happens to be on.  I don't purposely turn on any sport on TV any more.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, and, uh, I guess it's just changed 'cause I mean, when we were kids we did used to watch that sort of stuff on TV but like you said, because it's become such a -- a money grabbing type of thing, um, it's just kind of turned me off.  I think we're older and wiser now and we can see it for what it is.
L:  I think so.
R:  You know.
L:  Yes ma'am.
R:  So, um, anyways ... So, what do you hunt?
L:  Ah, deer, turkey; turkey's my favorite thing but --
R:  Oh!
L:  Even -- unless I can learn something from it, I won't even watch turkey hunting on -- on TV, you know --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- like I say, I -- I prefer that -- if I can't do it, I don't want to watch somebody else have fun.  I want to -- to be doing it, you know.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  But if there was somebody giving instructions now on how to call or, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- do different things about turkey hunting; that I could -- you know, I'm always open for -- to learn something new. But --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just to watch somebody and -- and here some hunting has become like football.  Th- these people hire these guides; they take 'em out and show 'em where the animal is.  Some of 'em probably shoot it for it and --
R:  Oh, I know.  [LAUGH] --
L:  -- then the guys goes home; oh, look at the big deer I killed, you know.
R:  Oh, I know.  I know.  This --
L:  -- [MN] that's not hunting to me.
R:  -- has clubs out there and that's what they do.
L:  Yeah.  That -- that's -- that's not hunting.
R:  No, I agree.
L:  I wanna start from scratch.  I wanna go find where the -- my -- the animal or bird I'm hunting is.  And then I want to stalk him and shoot him myself and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, if I can't do that, I don't want to go, you know.  I'm -- 
R:  Mhm.  Good for you.  Good -- 
L:  Ah --
R:  -- do you fish also?
L:  Ah, somewhat, but usua- --
