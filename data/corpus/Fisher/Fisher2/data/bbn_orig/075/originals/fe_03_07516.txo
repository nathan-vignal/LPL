L:  Hello.  My name is Mariah.
R:  Hi.  My name's Mike.  How are you?
L:  Good.  And you? [NOISE]
R:  Really good.  Really good.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, I guess --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we have to discuss the, ah, bioterrorism and if the United States can prevent it I guess, right?
L:  Um, no.  I was told my topic of [LAUGH] the day was reality television.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, um, let's do that then.
L:  [LAUGH] As I say, we can -- we can discuss [LAUGH] anything.
R:  Whatever.  It doesn't --
L:  The -- as we'll[?] say, that was --
R:  It doesn't matter to me.  Ah, you know, whatever you want to do is fine.  Um, reality TV, um -- well, ah, do you want me to start or do you want to start?
L:  Oh, it doesn't matter to me.
R:  Okay.
L:  Are -- are you a fan?
R:  Ah, no.  Actually, I don't even have a TV but I do -- I've -- I see it from time to time.  I know what's going on and what not.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um -- I think it's, um -- it's, sort of, ah, a trend in this country. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, well, not in this country.  It's maybe started in this country and then it's gone to, ah, other, um, European countries and what not and, ah, I think it's, um, m- maybe the -- the networks are at their end of, ah, not knowing what to do and it's got to -- they've got to, um, constantly, um, reinvent the wheel.  You know what I mean?
L:  Yes. [NOISE]
R:  It -- it really seems that way and it's so, um -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's absolutely frustrating and flabbergasting.  I'm so s- -- I'm so tired of it, you know?
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  And, ah, it's --
L:  I -- I keep referring to them as the train wrecks.
R:  Sure.
L:  Because all these people tune in to watch them and, you know, I mean, we have to watch ourselves r- -- you know, around my house or you know -- you know that show is on and here's this woman who's going to marry this guy that is completely wrong for her and you just tune in anyways and you're like, "Oh, I gotta see why she does it".
R:  Yes.
L:  And I'm like, "No, we can't watch it.  That's not good for us".  So ...
R:  Yeah.  I -- I say read a book or something or listen to music.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Hon- honestly.  Really.  It doesn't -- it doesn't, ah -- tele- -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the reason I -- I don't have a TV any more is because of that, you know --
L:  Yes.
R:  I'm so tired of the media and all the, ah -- the bullshit -- excuse me -- and that -- that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- goes on and -- and, ah -- yeah.  It's -- it's just ridiculous I think.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But um, [MN] I think it's, um -- you know, I think, um -- I don't know if you've read George Orwell?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, his book called nineteen eighty four about --
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  Yeah.  Yes.  It's, ah -- it's, um -- it's, sort of, indicative of that.  You know?  It's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's, um --
L:  That they're just going to keep watching you.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's --
L:  Oh --
R:  It's really --
L:  That's --
R:  -- crazy.  You know?
L:  That Big Brother television show.  I mean, I think that's the epitome of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that story 'cause they just have those TV cameras right in their face.
R:  Yeah.  Just by calling it that, you know?  It's --
L:  I know. [LAUGH]
R:  That's -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's ridiculous.  I -- I -- I, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I spent some time in Germany last year and -- and, ah, they have the same -- the same show and they -- in fact, they call it Big Brother.  They say, "Big Brother" like that, you know?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  The -- the German accent.  And it's, ah -- it's, kind of, um -- it's, kind of, odd.  Um, the -- because it's -- it's more i- in -- in -- in Germany, they show nudity and what not and -- and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and then they -- they, um -- they don't show actual sexual acts but they -- I mean, they allude to them and what not and it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's ridiculous.  It's absolutely, ah -- there's no reason to, ah -- to do that.  I d- -- I don't --
L:  Well, it's my Aunt[?] [inaudible] were stationed in, um, England for a while --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with the Air Force and they -- they brought [LAUGH] home a couple of video tapes of soap operas because she just could not get over what they showed on their television.  And it was very graphic and I was like -- you know, we always think stuffy Brits but their versions of reality TV are a who- whole lot more so than ours.
R:  Oh, sure.  Yeah.
L:  Ours are, kinda, cut and pasted, you know, versions so --
R:  Yeah.  Of course.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it -- it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's -- I -- I, kind of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- blame, ah -- well, one of the -- the big, ah, factors I think is, ah, MTV.  Ah, they're so, um -- i- it's like all the kids are -- are -- are drawn to it.  They come home from school and that's w- -- the first thing they do is put on MTV.  You know, and -- and they listen and -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, ah, it seems to me that the music --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is so, um -- well, it's not even music -- it's not even music any more.  It's all --
L:  No.
R:  -- talking, right?
L:  It's all those weird shows.
R:  Yeah.  It's --
L:  I mean, we don't even -- we don't even turn that on.  We didn't grow up with television like we have now though.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I lived in the country so you were lucky if you got your three main channels and --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- the only adult programming I was ever allowed to watch was [LAUGH] the Bill Cosby Show.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I have this very warped sense of reality about TV.  I turn it on and I was like, "Whoa, what is all of this coming into my house?"  I would -- you know, I wouldn't invite strangers in to talk like that in front of my child.  Why -- why do I invite the people on the TV in?
R:  I understand.  It -- it is -- it's -- it's frustrating and frightening and it's, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, the -- the -- the -- the -- these -- these ideas of, ah, people -- it -- it's really voyeurism isn't it?  I guess.  You know --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- people -- people looking at, ah, other people doing things, you know?  And not --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it doesn't have to be sexual but it's close enough and it's -- I don't know.  It's just -- it's -- it's --
L:  Well, some of it is.  I mean, if you ever tune in to any of those ...  Well, Paradise Island, I've seen ads for that and I think that's all they're selling with that show. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I think you --
L:  [NOISE] And --
R:  -- have to sleep with someone or you get bumped off the show, right?
L:  I know.  Because they keep bringing in new people --
R:  Oh, my god.
L:  -- each week and I thought, "Well, you know what that is".  That's like -- [NOISE] let's see who across America most wants to have sex with somebody on this show each week. [NOISE] And I thought that's just ridiculous. [NOISE] 
R:  It is ridiculous. It's --
L:  But [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah.  It --
L:  Even on those -- those bachelor and bachelorette shows, you know?  Here's these single people and they encourage them to date twenty people at a time.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  I think that's just -- that's a bit obscene.
R:  If -- if I had TV, ah, the only thing I would watch would be --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, Discovery and -- and, ah, you know, um, the -- the Turner Classic Movies --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and stuff like that.  It is -- just -- there's just nothing that I find interesting anymore, you know?  I- it --
L:  Well, that's the -- our -- our favorite channel is the Food Network and I --
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  -- say that's as close to reality TV as I get.  But my d- dinners never turn out that way --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so I know it's not really [LAUGH] reality television. [LAUGH]
R:  I would agree with you.  Yeah.  Definitely.  My favorite, I think, is, ah, Mario.
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  He's just -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- something special about him.  He really -- he -- he's really researches it and he spends so much time there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, and -- wonderful.  And, ah, yeah.  Very, very good.  But, ah --
L:  But we like that and we like -- there's a show called Unwrapped and they go to, like, the plants and they detail how they make various things from ice cream bars to lollipops and --
R:  Really?
L:  It's -- it's very interesting.  And it's, kind of -- I mean, that's -- it's own little form of reality television.  It just happens [NOISE] to be about candy bars instead of, you know, people [NOISE] trying to win --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- games against each other.
R:  [LAUGH] Yes.  Absolutely, I guess.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Then actually, it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it makes me think of --
L:  [NOISE]
R: -- um -- I -- I have a Masters in Philosophy and, um, they --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the very notion of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- reality -- I don't want to get into a debate about it, you know, 'cause it's not the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- this isn't the forum for it but it just -- it makes you wonder why, um -- why they call it reality and whose reality, in fact, is it?
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  You know what I mean?  It's -- it's just --
L:  Oh, I know.  I'm -- I'm all for the thought that if they want to play Survivor Island, we really let 'em play. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You don't give 'em any supplies.  You could drop them out there and the last one standing wins. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  All the other guys -- well, we just send you home in a box to your family. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Y- you said you wanted to play so ...
R:  There you go.  Sure.  Sure.  Mhm.  Mhm.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.
L:  That's --
R: Yeah.
L:  If they wanna -- if they wanna do real, w- we can let 'em have real, you know?
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.  Exactly.
L:  So ...
R:  I know.  I know.  And -- and, ah -- yeah.  Th- the -- the whole idea of, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- making, um -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- making it fit for TV.  You know, they -- they -- the people, obviously -- they act for the camera --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and -- and not, um -- I mean, if it was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, I guess Big Brother -- I don't know how it is in America with Big Brother but I guess the -- they know the camera's there.
L:  Yes.
R:  And they -- they can see it.  Maybe it would be better if they couldn't see it, you know?  And make [LAUGH] -- and -- and, ah -- you know, they would act -- they wouldn't know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- w- when the -- one was on --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and when it was off.
L:  [NOISE] Well, that's --
R:  Well, what -- you know --
L:  I don't know that -- in the American version [NOISE] that they can see [NOISE] when it's on. [NOISE] It's usually behind, like, the two way glass type stuff.
R:  Oh, is it?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Okay.
L:  But they know that [NOISE] the cameras [NOISE] are back there so [NOISE]  they, you know, are always on some different type [NOISE] of behavior to --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- [NOISE] you know, for the camera and for the other players so that they can outplay the [NOISE] other people and get [NOISE] voted for or what have you.  So ...
R:  Sure.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hm.  Okay.
L:  Not right now.
R:  Interesting.  I wonder how much time we've got?
L:  I have no clue.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  'Cause this -- this is my first call.
L:  Oh, this is my third so --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Though I say they each seem to be getting longer though.  They keep giving me odder and odder topics so --
R: Oh, really -- really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  It -- it's, ah -- I, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I was supposed to be four o'clock today -- I'm in the Eastern Time Zone.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, the, ah -- the machine called --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I -- and I -- I listened to what it said and then it said, "Please wait for your, um -- for your person --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to come on".  And -- and I did --"
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and as soon as he or she came on it -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it was a click and a hang up.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, [LAUGH] I couldn't get anybody.  So, I hung -- you know, I -- obviously, I waited for thirty seconds and talked and said, you know, "Hello, what's going on?"  And, ah, then someone, ah, said, ah -- or then -- then, ah, I hung up and I -- I called the number on -- and from the first email --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and that's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- how I got you I guess.
L:  [NOISE] Oh. [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So ...
L:  Huh.  It just randomly calls me up [NOISE] and I [NOISE] take a moment to talk to it and --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So --
L:  I guess, in this case, they expected me to take a few minutes away from watching reality television to talk to you but --
R:  Yeah.  Of course. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 'Cause that's what everybody's [NOISE] doing in their opinion [NOISE] but ... [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I --
L:  Gotta love those --
R:  I --
L:  -- topics. [NOISE] 
R:  -- just wonder why, um -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- why can't they create --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- other programs, you know?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Ah, is this -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I guess this is the thing to do.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  A -- um, um, I don't know.  It's just --
L:  I think the whole reality television bit came out whenever they had that strike going on out in Hollywood and they were like, "Well, we'll -- we'll find programming with or without you guys".
R:  Really?
L:  The actors' strike.  Because that was what?  Four or five years ago.  They had that big actors' strike out there.  This --
R:  I vaguely remember that.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  The screenwriters strike -- it was some sort of strike.  I didn't pay close attention.  And it didn't --
