L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  [MN]
L:  I'm Carol.
R:  Hi.  I'm Pam.  I'm in Ohio.
L:  Oh, hi.  I'm in Los Angeles.  How are you?
R:  Oh, my gosh, we're quite a ways apart.
L:  Quite a ways --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and it's --
R:  Have you --
L:  -- hot and nasty here.  How is it in Ohio?
R:  It's kinda sticky, yeah.
L:  Ah.
R:  Sticky.
L:  I- I'm from back east.  I'm from New York City and New Jersey area so it can get a bit sticky there too.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But at least it's not polluted. [LAUGH]
R:  That is true.  That is true.  
L:  [MN] That's the good news.  So, hi.
R:  Ah, well, is this your first call?
L:  [LIPSMACK] This is my second call actually and the one -- the first one I did was a couple of weeks ago.  I just haven't had the time to do it.  How about you?
R:  This is my third call.
L:  Oh, good, so, you're a pro.
R:  Oh, yeah, I just n- -- this is kind of a hard topic.
L:  It is and this is about bioterrorism --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- right?
R:  It says a way that, ah, the country can better prevent it and what comes to my mind before anything would be, um, stricter enforcement at the airports --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and the borders, um, because they say even though all of this has happened, ah, so many things can slide right through at airport security.  I'm a travel agent and I --
L:  Oh, are you?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm.
R:  I work a lot with that area [MN] and, ah, I feel that, you know, they -- well, they concentrate on little babies and old women so much when they should be concentrating a little bit more --
L:  Yeah, I -- I agree with you.  I -- I unfortunately am not a travel agent even though I would love to be --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- but for a period I got to do a bit of traveling and I lived overseas for a while and --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- I mean, you know, if somebody said, "Hi, do you want to go to Africa tomorrow?", I'd say, "Sure, what time --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- are we leaving?"  I should talk to you --
R:  Oh, so you've been around.
L:  -- should talk to you after this off the record about, ah, tour guide jobs or something.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] but [MN] -- but, you know, I -- I agree with you.  I mean, the whole thing of terrorism and terrorism in general [MN] in my opinion is, you know, we've got -- we've got two things going on.  We've got whatever great unknowns from the outside wanting to come in --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and also, quite unfortunately, we have our -- our  -- our very own nuts --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- here.  I mean, with that whole, ah, anthrax scare and -- and, you know, let's face it, the first terrorism that we had was with Jim McVeigh and those people in Oklahoma.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  It -- it -- it's -- it's been around.  You just didn't hear about it as much and now since it's bigger they focus more on it.  You hear more about it.  
L:  I agree with you a- and personally, not to get into a whole big political thing here, but, um, I was very dis- -- I -- I agree with you about the airports and borders and stuff like that and what just got me a little bit, um, crazy, to say, well, amongst many other things --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- ah, with the current administration was that -- that they actually, you know, they -- they keep on giving all this quack quack about terrorism and I won't enter the war with this.  I'm talking about domestic protection.  I'm not talking about Iraq, let's not even go there.
R:  Ahah.
L:  Um, but, meanwhile, what they have done which has gotten me, especially -- I live -- I don't know where in Ohio you live.  Are you in Cleveland or a big city?
R:  I'm about ninety miles north of Cincinnati.
L:  Right and so, but, so, you're not in the middle of, you know, seventeen million crazy people --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like I am and what's gotten me absolutely compr- -- completely crazy and this has to do -- it doesn't have to do with terrorism and everything else and plus we have our lovely earthquakes -- what they have done, on one hand they seem to be [LIPSMACK] going on about the war on terrorism and setting off all sorts of wars that may or may not be necessary, I'll be very middle of the road on that one --
R:  I agree.
L:  -- since that's not the subject but don't get me started on [MN] --
R:  Well, you know --
L:  -- you know, and it's -- but the thing is what they have done, getting back to the subject, is that they have done nothing but slash budgets on emergency, fire, police, medical and stuff like that so, if there was a terrorist thing, like, in a city like Los Angeles --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they've done nothing but cut all the emer- -- funding for emergency people incl- -- a- and not even emergency, just our local police and fire budgets.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, to me, and [MN], I mean, this is something I'm not making up and its not because of my other political stances, it's a very real thing if you start reading about it or look it up on the Internet, you know, as far as --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- look at real news sources, not just the Internet, that they keep on cutting back on things like that and -- and also effective border things.  My dad lives in Florida --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- and they've got, you know, the boat people and everything else coming in [MN] and they've cut back all their border patrols there along with their medical mer- -- ah, emergency personnel so I'm going, "This is not making any sense".
R:  I didn't even realize that.
L:  Yeah, yeah, then this is not a funny -- it's not f- fun -- fun time in -- in -- in our government's history, I think.  You know, money is going to building weapons. [MN] Money is going, you know, for health care and rebuilding other people's stuff when [MN] we don't have health care. [MN]
R:  I really think the same thing.  They need --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to stay home and concentrate on what's going on in this country --
L:  M- m- -- yeah, my ru- --
R:  -- versus trying to feed the world.
L:  Right.  My running joke is, okay, I need a mammogram.  C- -- if I go -- get my ass to Iraq can I get one for free?
R:  There you go.
L:  'Cause I'm not insured any more.  I lost my health insurance --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- six months ago, so, but as far as the terrorism, bioterrorism, you know, that's a both, [MN] I think, an internal and external thing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, [MN] in terms of what we can do to prevent it, [LIPSMACK] I don't know, but I think what we can is -- do is get more communication going with our intelligence about internal stuff, beef up the border stuff that they've already cut back, but most of all have, I think it's almost as important to have preparation ready to go if, God forbid, there is one and that's what scares me more.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's not that we might have one but if we do have one that we -- that they've cut back all the emergency help, especially major cities and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that's -- 
R:  Well --
L:  -- that's my thing.
R:  -- a fear of mine being in a small little town, farming type community, we don't have any protection.
L:  Right.
R:  There isn't a police force within hundreds of miles that you could say could handle anything that happened [MN] around here.
L:  You've got a local -- local police force of five that knows everybody or something?
R:  I've got five that live right around --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- me in this neighborhood and there isn't one of 'em I'd run to and hope they could help me. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They'd be running twenty paces ahead of me.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  My -- my sister lives in Maine on an island off of an island --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so, you know, we have these discussions and it's, like, you know, we're such polar opposites about where we live and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it's just, it's such different realities.  I envy you --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- in one regard.
R:  [MN]
L:  I -- I need to be in a city because of my work but I -- I definitely envy you.
R:  Yeah?
L:  But you're right.  I mean, you're also -- what if something did happen?  You guys are so far away that by the time the people from the big city clean up their mess and get to you it's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- like [MN], "Sorry".
R:  Well, when the war hit, um, I do -- see, I worked for a doctor almost all my life --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I just started with this, ah, travel agency out of Seattle, Washington.  I do everything over the Internet.
L:  Oh, good for you.
R:  Yeah, and I -- it's the first time in history I've worked from home.  Well, right when I really got started the war hit --
L:  [MN] Oh.
R:  -- and you should have seen, the company sends me leads from our Internet pages, and you should have seen it hit zero.
L:  Zero.
R:  And then as soon as the war was about two weeks in you c- -- ah, we really specialize in Disney and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they're running ninety five percent occupancy.  They are packed because people are afraid to go out.
L:  I'd be more afraid to go to Disneyland than I would be to go to Europe right now --
R:  Well --
L:  -- but that's just me. [MN]
R:  -- believe it or not, Disney has a no fly zone over the parks.
L:  Oh, do they?
R:  Oh, hey, they're big.
L:  I didn't know that.
R:  They're big.  The comp- -- the government works with 'em.  No fly zones -- 
L:  Wow.
R:  -- over the parks and, ah, under cover security are all over the place.
L:  Well, that's good to kn- -- no, that is good to know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That really is.  I work in -- in the film and TV business, ah, though --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- these days I'm mainly unemployed and I unfortunately lost my shirt on the [SIGH] markets and stuff --
R:  Me too.
L:  -- and I kept on -- and I kept on w- -- but I'd be like, you know, it's j- -- it's scary, I'm living like a nineteen year old all of a sudden and all this and, you know, I kept on seeing all these great travel bargains and I'm going, "Oh, if this were only three years ago, I'd be --"
R:  You know what?
L:  "-- traveling like a crazy girl". [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, we wanted to move to Florida --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- and three years ago I could have bought the best house Florida has to offer and g- get three of 'em --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and now I'm, like, I'm too petrified to make the move because everything we had in the market's gone.
L:  G- -- it's gone, yeah, yeah.
R:  And it -- it is so sad to look where we came from.  We're forty four years old and we were building, building, building and things were going fantastic and then the next day you look and -- and you think --
L:  It's gone.
R:  -- oh, it's gotta come back and it just never stopped.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I'm -- I'm your age and I'm single --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and it's -- it's, like, I'm going, "Okay, I'm living in a -- an apartment in a bloody bar area with all my furniture in storage" --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and it's, like, holy cow --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, it's like, whoa, and unfortunately my business, [MN] you know, I -- I'm making under fifteen thousand dollars a year now.  I'm ready to move home to my mother in New York 'cause --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I think New York's an easier market, you know.  Look, there's -- I -- I have a car that runs, the cat is fed, I have a roof --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and there's food in the refrigerator so it could be worse but you sit there and you go --
R:  Where you came from.
L:  -- yeah, and this isn't about being rich or having a lot of stuff.  It's about living, in my case, a bohemian lifestyle and not having to work at McDonald's to do it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I -- h- --
L:  So, it's -- it's been tough for everybody.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's just been aw- -- and I know a lot of people who are not even in, like yourself, or even friends of mine who aren't actors or whatever and everybody's been had.  It's just been --
R:  Yeah. [MN] I --
L:  -- crazy.
R:  -- the doctors I associated with, to the person that just put a few bucks away a week, they're all in the same boat.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, what's gonna happen to us when we retire? [MN]
L:  Ah, we're in --
R:  I had --
L:  -- a -- a boatload of trouble --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- plus the fact that our gen- -- our age group particularly --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if things go on the way they do, we may not have social security and, God knows, I'd get --
R:  I know it.
L:  -- thirty nine cents a month anyway.
R:  Oh.
