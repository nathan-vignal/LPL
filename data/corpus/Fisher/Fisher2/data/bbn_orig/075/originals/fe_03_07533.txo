R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  My name's Kathy.
L:  My name's Darren.
R:  Hi Darren.
L:  How ya doing Kathy?
R:  Okay.  How're you doing?
L:  Ah, where are you from.
R:  Where am I living now?
L:  Yes.
R:  [LIPSMACK] In Merchantville right outside of Philadelphia -- in Jersey.
L:  Okay.  I'm in Raleigh, North Carolina.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I wanna move to North Carolina.
L:  Oh, it's -- it's pretty nice weather down here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, ah, I guess the topic is what we would do in case of bioterrorism?
R:  Oh, how the US can prevent it?
L:  Oh.  Okay.  Do you have any h- -- opinion?
R:  Yeah.  I've lots of opinions but I don't know anything.
L:  [LAUGH] Ah --
R:  What about you? [LAUGH] I'm in education. [LAUGH] 
L:   Oh, you are?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm in construction and I've been in the military and -- and, ah, so I've got a little bit -- I've done a little bit of everything.
R:  Uh-huh.  I guess from -- from the standpoint of when you were in the military you must've run into it?
L:  Yeah.  I've spent two tours over in, ah -- on the Med Cruise or -- or in the Mediterranean.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, ah, which we were involved in Egypt and Libya.  And of course, I was in in nineteen seventy seven so, um, we had a confrontation with, ah, Muammar Gaddafi.
R:  Ah.
L:  And took care of that problem.  And, ah -- but as far as what we can do to prevent it?
R:  Mm.  Bioterrorism.
L:  Um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, [SIGH] I think they -- well, see I hate to say the UN but I -- I really -- that word just gets me.  But, ah, I think the UN needs to -- either the US needs to pay -- play a larger role in it and we need to get involved in sanctions or as far as what certain countries that are considered hostile, what they can, ah -- as far as buy materials or buy things that would, um, possibly get 'em involved in it.  Um, a- -- the --there's so many different things to do.  Um, as far as your education, ah -- like you're saying you're into education -- people who having degrees, ah, b- -- especially people from these hostile countries that are -- are going for degrees --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think we oughta maybe +deter[?] or, ah -- to, kinda, not let 'em come through our country to get these degrees.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't know, being that you're in education, how you feel about that.  Of course, anybody in the world can get an education but I don't think we should support certain people if they're on our hot list.  Um, that are -- I mean, but the -- you know, how do you police that, you know?
R:  We --
L:  You don't wanna just cut everybody off.
R:  We can't even keep viruses --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- out of computers.  I mean [LAUGH] --
L:  Well, that's -- that's true.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] what do you -- what's your thoughts?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, [LIPSMACK] I think it's pretty much, like, you know, shooting in the dark to a large extent.  You know, I -- I tend to agree if -- if, um, United States can take an active role in intervening when -- when there's a purchase of the kind of chemicals that could produce that.  But I don't know to what extent the US can really stop something like that if -- especially if it's proved -- you know, between two countries that are both hostile to us.
L:  Right.  Well, that -- that's -- that's true.  Um, a- again I think it [SIGH] -- a- and -- I use the term UN pretty w- widespread but the -- I think the -- there needs to be a -- a new type of United Nations of -- of countries that are -- who are committed to stop this type of thing and who actually have a little, um -- more than just words and, ah, who can actually go in and -- now, whether it be violent or non violent, ah, they need to be able to, ah, [SIGH] -- it just it gets me the UN now is run by, what I call, third world countries.  Countries who -- who really don't have a democracy or who have m- m- -- ah, monetary interest in these countries -- third world countries and -- and they're really not gonna do anything.  Especially like France.
R:  Mm.
L:  Um, they've got money invested in that country and so does Germany and -- and Russia and a few -- you know, all these countries that are defending the Middle Eastern states, ah, have got a -- a -- a financial stake in it.
R:  Well, we've sold them plenty of stuff.
L:  Well, a- and again, that's the issues that need to be brought up and we need to -- that we need to police that within our own country too.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And I mean, I'm not, you know -- but it --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- but something's gotta be done and I mean, we're not -- I don't think we're selling 'em, you know, things that are -- well, in the past we have and I -- and I will say back in the seventies and eighties.  I mean, it was open trades.  You know, anything you could sell, sell it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But I think because of what's happened here in the last ten, twelve years, I think we've tightened down, you know, ah, on these people who sell them things do -- I mean, there's third and fourth party sales going on here.
R:  Sure.  Yeah.
L:  I mean, we sell to people, ah, over in the Middle East, like, it's friendly and they turn around and sell to one of their friends and here the third -- third one down the road's turning around and selling it back to our enemies so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I think it all needs to be monitored and -- and really watched closer but, ah, again, it all goes back -- there needs to be a police, ah -- a world police or somebody who can actually get involved in this and not somebody who's just gonna sit back and -- I mean, the UN is -- was started out good.  Like, a lot of organizations were put in place for that.  But then, as time went on, they -- it -- they didn't seem to grow or change with the world's needs.  An- and they're, kind of, still stuck back there in World War Two which -- which the U- UN -- after the Cold War was put in place and -- and I just feel they -- they've, kinda, sputtered out and stalled and they're not really looking after world peace.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, ah, they go into these hostile countries where there's war going on and they just stand there and they're not supposed to intervene but they can watch 'em kill each other.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Which I think's wrong.  I -- I think that if the shooting starts they step in and you shoot again, we shoot back.  And, you know, stop the conflict before it gets real heavy.  But they're not doing that.  And as far as bioterrorism, well, then that's where you get into the -- into these, ah -- if we had a, um -- a real UN in place they can track all these people who're ...  I mean, in the education part of it there is -- you know where all the scientists are going.  You know who's got degrees in what.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, that -- that's -- that's -- I don't -- if -- even if they're from Russia or China -- I mean, these people who got degrees -- our -- our CIA, they know all these people and so does the British, ah, intelligence and French intelligence.  All these people know these -- these, ah -- these educated professors who are -- who are in bio- biochemistry and--
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- all these other fields.  And they just need to keep an eye on 'em and monitor 'em and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- find out where they're all b- -- you know?  Especially if a -- if a bunch of 'em starting to flood into Iraq or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- flood into, ah -- ah, you know, into North Korea.  I mean, it's a -- then something -- signal should be going out that somebody should -- should start doing something.
R:  So, it's actually intervening before --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it gets to the point of actually trying --
L:  Well, it's --
R:  -- to t- -- you know, detect --
L:  If you ty- -- to try to stop it after -- after --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- they've developed it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because it -- it can be hidden just like they say Iraq's already developed it and it's -- it can be hidden in small vials and they can bury it somewhere you'd never find it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, y- -- it -- it needs to start back, as you would say, in the education. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, ah -- but, ah, I -- i- -- that's to the extent of what you can do for the stuff that's out there now.  There's not much you can do.
R:  Mm.
L:  A vial can be passed -- you know, you can pass vials of stuff from hand to hand to hand and -- and, ah, no telling where it's at.
R:  Mm.
L:  And it can be concealed so easily.
R:  So, what about after the fact?  Like, now?  A- and the- there's a lot of stuff that's pa- -- that's gone on that has gotten us into the situation we're in now with bioterrorism.  What can we do now?  Is there anything we can do now?
L:  Well ...
R:  What do you -- you know, do you think?
L:  [LIPSMACK] What can we do now?  Well, first of all, y- y- you [LAUGH] --
R:  To prevent the vials --
L:  Well, you -- I -- I might -- I might be --
R:  -- from being passed.  Yeah.
L:  I might have a too strong of a hand here.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I come from a military background but I think all these countries that are the ones that are causing the problems -- Palestine, Iraq, North Korea -- I think they need to be stomped o- -- stomped out.  Ah, at least the leaders who're -- who're pushing this.  'Cause they're the ones who are gonna actually cause this to happen.
R:  Mhm.
L:  These other countries -- a- and especially if we do nothing.  I mean, if you just sit back and do nothing you're gonna have more nine one ones.  Um, a- and I -- and I -- I'd -- well, I'm an -- a republican and -- and I guess I agree totally with what Bush did to Iraq and Al Qaeda, um, because you just can't sit back and -- and turn the other cheek.  It just -- especially with a third world fanatic c- -- ah, country that, you know, if -- they're just -- they prey that you turn the other cheek.  I mean, so they can slap you again.  And, ah -- and I've spent a lot of time overseas and they are totally different than we are.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They -- they don't think like we do.
R:  Right.  It's a different culture.
L:  Right.  And -- and so, you, kinda, gotta play on their playing field.  They understand what it is to take somebody out.  I mean, if they see that you're gonna be passive and sit there, they love it.  They're just gonna keep taking you out.  But if they see that you're gonna bite back a- -- then, you know, th- -- they're -- they're gonna be more cautious the next time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I mean, you're not gonna stop 'em and -- and they're ju- -- it just, you know, it's -- it just can't happen.  So, I guess you need to, ah, chop off the head of the rattler and, ah, to, ah, prevent, you know -- from anybody b- -- getting bit.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But that's, ah, a little strong.  I'm talking to the m- -- the university. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  My wife walked in and looked at me, like, "What are you talking about?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  So, how did you hear about his thing?
L:  Um, my sister in law actually.  She's -- she's an AOL addict.  She, ah, sponsors rooms and stuff and she got on there and says, "Oh, I know where you can earn some quick money".
R: Oh.
L:  [LAUGH] So, I said, well, let -- my wife said, "Well, you like to talk.  Get on there and do it".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, ah, of course, is this -- this has been going on about a month and a half now I just -- I'm -- like, the phone rings and I hear the speaker phone pick up and it's the university and I'm like, "Oh, no.  I don't wanna talk tonight".
R:  Oh.
L:  But, ah -- no.  It's, ah -- there's not a lot you can do.  I mean, unless you go after the sources and go after the people who would have a reason to use it.  That's about all you --
