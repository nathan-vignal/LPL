R:  Hu- ub- ub- Hello.
L:  Hi.  My name is Bette.  What's yours?
R:  Oh, mine is Richard.  Richard Delon.
L:  Hi Richard.  So, we're supposed to talk about professional sports on TV.
R:  Yes.
L:  What's your favorite?
R:  Oh, is it professional sports or just sports -- sports in general?
L:  I thought it said professional.
R:  Oh, well, I like professional basketball.
L:  Oh, uh, oh.
R:  Yeah, something's wrong -- something sounds wrong with the phone.
L:  It is probably my cell phone, which I am using but it --
R:  Oh, okay, that's --
L:  I'm determined to stay on here t- ten minutes anyway --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- if we can make -- if you can tolerate it.
R:  Yeah, it's fine, it's fine.
L:  Okay.
R:  [MN]
L:  Um, well, my favorite's kind of odd because it doesn't, uh, it's not even on TV until late spring and summer.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  My favorite is swimming.
R:  Oh.
L:  Any kind of swimming competition is deep in my heart so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Matter of fact I -- I -- I wanted to be on the swim team myself but I just can't seem to find the time.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  They practise so much --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so, yours is basketball.  Any favorite team?
R:  Yeah, well, see, I'm calling from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- and I like the Philadelphia Seventy Sixers --
L:  Oh, well.
R:  -- but I like professional basketball and my city has, uh, got a rich, uh, basketball tradition so all the old stalwarts like Will Chamberlain and all of them, I really love basketball anyway 'cause I used to play a lot --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- 'cause I'm -- I'm retired now so I'm a little too old to be playing with the young guys, but I -- I love the sports.  I like to watch it, like to play it.  I've -- I've been fascinated with it ever since high school.
L:  Yeah, I, now, honestly, I played basketball maybe three or four times --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, in high school only --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- um, [LAUGH] I was doing it for a grade.  I w- I was supposed to do it once for a grade and decided that I liked it so hm --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- but then I thought, "Well, no, my grades will slip 'cause I spend all this time practising", so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I just gave it up except --
R:  If you eve-- where are you c- --
L:  It's not bad.
R:  Where are you calling from?
L:  Texas.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [MN]
R:  What part of Texas?
L:  Oh, my gosh.  You heard of Dallas, right?
R:  I heard of Dallas, yes.
L:  I'm south of Dallas [LAUGH].
R:  Okay [LAUGH].
L:  I'm going to give you my town name.  You tell us if you've ever heard it before.  You ready?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Waxahachie.
R:  No.
L:  No [LAUGH].
R:  No.  You know where -- I -- I'm going to tell you a little secret.  Between you and I -- it -- my -- because of my obsession with sports I know, like, Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, I knew somebody from Tala, um, Waco and the University of Texas, Austin, places like that.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  The big places, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know too much about this -- the smaller -- is it a smaller town or a city?
L:  Small town, small town --
R:  Oh, oh.
L:  -- only about, um, probably now about thirty thousand.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  That's all.
R:  He- --
L:  Small town.
R:  Very good.
L:  To me it -- it's really like a suburb of Dallas but it's not actually close.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, okay, but how -- so how far is it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to Dallas?
L:  Oh, it's only about thirty five miles south.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Mhm, yes.
R:  Yes.
L:  You know.
R:  Oh.
L:  Get there in fifteen, twenty minutes and back, yeah.
R:  Oh, well, that's pretty --
L:  So --
R:  -- uh, well, that's great 'cause --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I always tell my wife I've been in big cities all my life but I like -- 'cause we got a couple small towns here.  I like that area.  I like small towns 'cause big city -- and we live -- we live close to two universities and it's --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- hard to park.
L:  Oh, I know it is, uh.
R:  It's tough.
L:  Mm.
R:  I mean, we live in a major street and there p- -- University of Pennsylvania and Drexel is in walk -- Drexel University is in walking distance to where we live --
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  -- and we got students living in our block and this is city.  It's like -- it's not a real house.  It's twins, a nice block but the thing is you have a lot of trouble with parking --
L:  Oh, gosh, I can imagine, mm.
R:  -- and some people got, like --
L:  W- --
R:  -- [MN] I'm sorry go ahead.  I'm sorry.
L:  No, I'm so, you know, it's -- it's amazing.  There -- there is -- sometimes there's a time in life when you don't mind that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but later you may not want to be bothered and now h- --
R:  See, that's --
L:  -- I mis- -- [LAUGH] 
R:  -- the problem because, see, I used to be -- like I'm diabetic and I have, uh, little problems walking so what happened, when we was young my wife and I could park three blocks away and walk and we didn't mind --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but now I'm sort of sensitive --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- to -- and -- and, see, unlike you we get some vicious winters up here.
L:  Oh, cold.
R:  We get cold.  We -- it snows, uh, like we -- and this particular winter was very bad.
L:  Gosh, me.
R:  Ne- --
L:  Well, all, see, I don't like the cold weather at all.
R:  Okay.
L:  At all.  Well, you know what?  Um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just 'cause I know they're monitoring, uh, now, the basketball -- I -- I had some kind of -- some problems with basketball lately --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, and I guess it's with the key players.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, n- not realising that they have a time to shine --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then they need to get out of the way and help somebody else shine --
R:  Oh, yes, we got that pro- --
L:  Yeah, my -- my -- my main one right now is Michael Jordan.
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  I wanted him to stay out while he was on top and he came back and -- and kind of faded.
R:  And tarnished his star.  Yes, you're right.
L:  Yeah, and it's like, "Why did you do that?  You didn't need the money?"
R:  You didn't need the money --
L:  "You own the game", you know?
R:  -- and see, it's the ego and --
L:  Ego --
R:  -- ego --
L:  -- and, see, your ego gets deflated when you have been on the top and you go out there and you can't even --
R:  You can't do it anymore.
L:  -- do that anymore.  Yeah.
R:  Well, let me ask you a question.  Just for your own satisfaction do you still swim?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yes --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- but I'm -- I'm not competing with anyone.  I -- I --
R:  Oh, no, I mean, just for --
L:  -- no.
R:  -- just for your own personal satisfaction.
L:  Yeah.  I stopped diving because I had a diving accident --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] and it was my own fault.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Had my mind on something else --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and I went off the diving board not thinking and went straight to the bottom.
R:  Yeah, oh.
L:  Hit in the head and knocked myself unconscious and I --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I wouldn't have to get back up there though.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I know, you know, I'm -- I'm not young or anything but I'm still getting back up there --
R:  Well, god bless you.
L:  -- for my own --
R:  That -- that's understandable.
L:  -- for my own benefit, yeah.
R:  So, how, uh, just, uh, for your own enjoyment and don't say in a average week, how many times do you go swimming?
L:  Well, now, what's happened is during school year --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I just can't get there often --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- so, I've just gotten off for the summer.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I'm a school counselor.
R:  Which -- which school do you go to?
L:  Oh, well, I'm a school counselor --
R:  Oh, okay, oh, okay.
L:  -- and I've just gotten off for the summer and normally I go, like, three or four times a week --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- uh, but yesterday was my first day off so I'm just trying to catch up on some things right now.
R:  Oh, okay.  So, you're a counselor for a high school or college?
L:  Uh, no.  I'm a counselor for an elementary school.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  That's where it's worse now, believe it or not.
R:  Uh, oh, okay.
L:  It's worse there now --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- of all things.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I'm beat and I still need jails and little constitutions.  It's really getting terrible --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and if we can stop some of the problems at a young age w- we --
R:  I know.
L:  -- or at least, you know [LAUGH].
R:  My wife is --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- a retired high school teacher and she taught for thirty five years.
L:  Oh, my.  No, no, no, no, I'm not going there that long [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Not at all, yeah.
R:  But see, like I say, I enjoy -- see, the thing, uh, the problem I'm having with my enjoyment of sports, they're getting these kids out of high school and they're filling their minds up.  They -- that's why --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a lot of America youngsters don't have the value systems.
L:  That's right, that's right.
R:  They don't -- should go to four years of college, get an education and have something to fall back on.
L:  Really because that -- that's four -- the -- there's -- there's no guarantees, there's no guarantee your body's going to hold up --
R:  That's exactly right.
L:  -- and the way they pick up players one year and they're gone another year --
R:  They're gone the next year.
L:  -- are actually crazy.
R:  They're -- that's exactly right.
L:  Really.
R:  I mean, there's a kid who g- -- who played for Los Angeles.  He didn't even go to high school.  He went to high school didn't even go to college and he -- they wanted him to go to college and learn the skill.  He just went straight to the b- -- he was unusual but a lot of these young kids -- and that's why in professional sports the talent level was down because they got young kids who feel as though, "I don't have to go to class.  I don't have to go to college.  I'm going to become a pro" --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you can be -- look, I told my wife this.  It's easier to become a brain surgeon than a professional athlete because every city, they have more brain surgeons in Philadelphia than they do professional athletes.
L:  Hm.
R:  Think about that.  It's a lot of work.  Now, I'm -- I'm -- I'm understanding that to be a doctor but the jobs are -- if more -- they're looking for people like that.
L:  Right, right.
R:  If you play professional sports --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- maybe next year --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they may have one opening.
L:  Right, right, you're right.
R:  You know.
L:  That's right, and you know what?  There's a lot of professional athletes just staying in a lot of trouble.  See, they haven't had a chance to grow up.
R:  They don't have a chance to 'cause they're young, they become very rich and they have --
L:  Very, too, very rich.
R:  -- you -- very rich.  I mean, just one --
L:  They don't understand finances.
R:  They don't understand finances, the value of a dollar.  They haven't, you know, like, they're kids from high school.  The Nike Shoe Company gave them ninety million dollars and he never played a game of professional basketball in his life.
L:  Isn't that ridiculous?
R:  No.
L:  'Cause then it's like, "What are you going to do after this?"
R:  What are you going to do after that?
L:  To -- that's kind of what -- even though, uh, my, I think Michael did finish college.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's kind of what he's go- -- he's at now.  He's like, "Okay, I've done this.  I've been on top of the world.  Now, what am I going to do the rest of my life?"
R:  What am I going to do?
L:  That's right.
R:  And none of them do -- see, back in -- years ago in order for you to p- play professional basketball you had to either graduate in college or you -- y- y- your class had to graduate.  Now, they take --
L:  Don't they?
R:  -- them out.  The average superstar in the NBA they don't even went to college one or two years.  They go to college --
L:  They don't get to know anything about money.
R:  They think that's all --
L:  Nothing.
R:  -- we think about.
L:  And, like, you know, I mean, in -- if you've gotten used to having millions what do you all do when you have to st- -- work for it?
R:  When you have to work for a living --
L:  Forty thousand a year.
R:  -- do like you and I have to go --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- have to go --
L:  It's not going to work.
R:  -- it's -- explain -- become a counselor, and my wife -- my wife be the same.  My wife worked hard with those kids --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they got a superstar who said they don't have to do anything --
L:  I'm telling you.
R:  -- because he rushed around they don't have to do anything.
L:  Say it.
R:  Everything comes to me.  I don't have to buy a pair of sneakers or nothing.
L:  W- -- and -- and, uh, you know what?  It's what I'm saying.  Now, say once they get on -- if -- if they didn't get all over the TV they wouldn't make so much money --
R:  They wouldn't make so much money.
L:  -- and they wouldn't get all these endorsements and the thing about it is they don't understand these endorsements are just like water.  If things work well it'll sit on top --
R:  It'll sit on top.  If it don't --
L:  -- and if it doesn't they go --
R:  Just like the guys who play professional sports, they -- that's a part time job for them because the sneaker deals and endorsements deals --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- like that guy --
L:  Lots of money.
R:  -- Tonkin who plays for San Antonio Spurs --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- he's a ni- --
