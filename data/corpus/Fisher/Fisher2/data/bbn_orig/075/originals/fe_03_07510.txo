L:  [NOISE] [PAUSE] [SIGH] [PAUSE]
R:  [MN] Mm. [PAUSE]
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  How are you today?
R:  Good.  I'm Bonnie Nork[?] in Springfield, Massachusetts.
L:  Okay.  I'm Riley Shipman of Pensacola, Florida. [COUGH]
R:  Oh, I hear you've -- how do you l- -- you're quite a way from Massachusetts.
L:  You got that right.
R:  Yeah.  Well, Florida -- I guess there's been a lotta terrorism in Florida.
L:  Well, I haven't seen any terrorism.  I'm way up here in West Florida.  I'm as far west as you can get.  Five minutes west and I'll be in Alabama.
R:  Uh-huh.  What do you think of all the terrorism in the United States?
L:  Well, I think it's, ah, probably overdone -- overrated [SIGH] by the government.
R:  Well, it's scary.  It scares me a lot.  I, ah -- you know, since nine eleven I -- I've just been very scared to go anywhere or do anything.  I mean, it [MN] -- y- years ago I worked in a school and I saw these little kids, ah, come through -- they had hats on.  They -- their parents were Muslims and I never thought about it.  But now I see Muslims or people with those hats and their costume and I get scared.  I --
L:  Well, I really don't think there's any need to be concerned about it too much.  Um, I really don't think -- I think it's overrated and -- and, ah, of course, the best thing to do is to stay away from crowds and things.  That's --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- the thing.
R:  Yes.  That's -- that's about all you can do.  W- 
L:  Yeah.  And just, kinda, be -- be very familiar with what's around you and keep an eye on your surroundings, you know, when --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you go to the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- malls like Wal Mart or somewhere like that.
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]
L:  You -- you wanna watch and to keep your eyes all around you and --
R:  Yeah.  Keep your wits about you in other words.
L:  Sure.  Sure.  Just -- just be a- aware of your surroundings, you know, and I think you'll be all right.
R:  Yeah.  Well, it's scary and a little bit -- the, ah -- with the terrorism there's been this kidnapping in Massachusetts.
L:  Oh, you're gonna -- you're gonna find a whole lotta problems in the world as we -- as are populations increase.
R:  Yes.
L:  Ah, you're gonna find a whole lotta this, kind of, stuff and you're gonna have to learn to live with it because it's gonna -- it's gonna be an everyday thing for us, you know?
R:  Yeah.  What do you -- what do you think of the attacks in Israel?  That's -- what do you think about that?
L:  Well, there's a whole lot behind that.  There's a whole lot behind a lot of this stuff that we don't really know the truth about.
R:  That's right.  That's -- that's --
L:  That's -- that's why I -- I don't pay a lotta attention to any of it.
R:  Well, it scares me in Israel because I have family in Israel -- my son, daughter in law, seven grandchildren -- they're in a -- they're in a suburb of Az- -- ah, forty minutes south of Jerusalem and, you know, whenever I hear about terrorism I wonder, "Did they get to Batar?"  I mean, so far it's been in the West Bank and Jerusalem but my family goes into Jerusalem a lot and, you know --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- so they could be on one of those buses that get blown up by a terrorist or something.  So, I -- I think I have a legitimate --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- worry about terrorism.
L:  Well, are your folks, ah, Israeli's?
R:  Well, no.  They lived in the United States.  They -- my son and daughter in law were married in nineteen ninety.  They lived ten years in, ah, Brookline, Mass and they emigrated to Israel.  And --
L:  Well, are -- are they Jewish?
R:  Yes.  Yes.  I'm Jewish too and it -- it -- it really hurts me that there's all this trouble in Israel and I really think the, ah, Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, ah -- I think he's very much responsible for it.  I hope this new leader can do something.  You know, even though it's in Israel, it has an impact upon people in the United States.  Because, I mean, families go to Israel and they -- th- they can't travel as lightly and i- i- it effects the economy all this terrorism and it's the same in the other countries.  You know --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- countries that -- like Afghanistan, where we fought so hard.  You know, they got rid of the Taliban but there's still terrorism and the women there have a bad time.  It's just -- you know, they just can't live a normal life.
L:  Why do you think the Jewish people have had so much trouble over the -- over the centuries?
R:  Well, [SIGH] I -- I guess some of them, ah, didn't obey the commandments that God gave them.  But I -- I think -- I don't know.  I -- I -- I think it's just that, ah, they --
L:  I just wonder why the whole world hates the Jewish people so badly.  Do you know?
R:  Yeah.  That -- that's a good question.  I wonder the same thing.  And I think if they'd stop -- if these terrorists would stop hating and -- and try and get along with the Jewish people, the world would be a better place.  'Cause that's what it basically boils down to -- the terrorists -- the, ah, Muslim terrorists, they hate the United States because they think the United States is on the side of Israel and they hate Israel.  They want to see Israel blown up and destroyed.  I mean, y- you know, when they had the Oslo Peace Agreements in Norway, they made peace but that Yasser Arafat -- they don't want peace.  They wanna see Israel destroyed.  And they y- --
L:  They -- they've got -- they've got their -- their reasons just like the Jewish people have got their reasons, you know?  And, ah -- and they -- they think if that's their homeland, you know, and -- and --
R:  Well, it's --
L:  -- these people think it's theirs so I don't know who's right.  Do you?
R:  Well, I think it could be both of theirs if -- if they would stop attacking -- stop the attacks.  But, you know, they -- they -- they don't wanna live side by side with the Jews.  They want the whole thing.  They want the whole country.  They don't want just the West Bank.  They want Jerusalem and they want every bit of Israel.  They want -- they want Israel to go back to borders, ah, pre nineteen sixty seven -- before the Six Day War and Israel doesn't wanna do that.  And I don't blame them because if they gave back all those borders, it would ruin their security.  They'd -- they'd be vulnerable for attacks from Syria and Lebanon and Jordan.  No, I -- I don't know.  I mean, ever since Israel became a state they've let -- they've -- the Arabs have fought them tooth and nail.  In nineteen forty eight, Israel was declared a state.  And then, ah, that day, five Arab countries attacked them and they had to fight for their country.  But it -- it -- you know, you talk about terrorism now but it -- terrorism then.  And, I mean, it wasn't --
L:  Yeah.  Let me ask you a question; I've always wondered about the Jewish religion and -- and I wondered what the -- the difference is in the belief of Jesus Christ with the Jews versus, ah, Christian?
R:  All right.  J- Jesus Christ -- we don't think of him as a God.  We think of him as a teacher and we -- we don't believe that he's the Son of God.  We -- we don't --
L:  That he's --
R:  -- we don't acknowledge him as a God.  W- -- that -- that's the fundamental difference.
L:  Okay.  That's what I was thinking.  I wasn't sure what it was but I was -- w- wasn't quite sure there.
R:  Yeah.  But you -- you know, terrorism is being committed f- -- because of Jesus Christ.  In Russia, they used to have the Pogroms -- these -- these count- -- these Russians th- they -- they've -- believed that the Jews crucified Christ and over the centuries they've had this thing called the Blood Libel where the Christians accuse the Jews of, ah -- of, ah, killing a child for their Passover Seder.  And I mean, you know, ah -- I think the answer to all this terrorism and all this in the United States and in the world would be for the world to stop hating the Jews.
L:  Well, I think the, ah, Muslims hate both of the Jews and the Christians, you know?
R:  Well, then the hatred should stop.  And that's it --
L:  Yeah.  I know it should.
R:  -- the only way they'll ever be able to get along in this world.  Otherwise, we may have to migrate to the other planets.
L:  Are Jews -- are Jews considered Christians?
R:  No.
L:  No.  I don't guess they are, are they.
R:  No.  No.  We're not Christian.  Yeah.  We're --
L:  I -- I wondered -- I d- -- I just wonder why -- do you suppose the Muslim religion really hates, ah, our religions or is it ...?
R:  Well, they -- they're Koran does not preach hatred.  It -- it's sees Muslim extremists that --
