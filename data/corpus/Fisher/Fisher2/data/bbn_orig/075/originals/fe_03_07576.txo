R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello, my name's Ardy[?].  I'm calling from, uh, Seattle, Washington State.
L:  Well, I'm Elaine and I'm from Missouri.
R:  Uh, nice and, um -- nice to meet you.  Nice to talk with you. [NOISE]
L:  Yes.
R:  Um, you heard that t- the topic is.  This is yours -- uh, first call on the study?  Uh, it is my second one and, um, [NOISE] I don't know if I know a lot about this, uh, professional sports in the States, which, um, since I'm not, uh, originally native American. [NOISE]
L:  Okay.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Well --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- this is gonna be interesting because we don't have a TV.
R:  Oh, you don't have a TV?
L:  No.
R:  [MN]
L:  So, we don't watch professional sports.  I have seen some on TV but not, you know -- not to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- sit down and really watch it and that.  Um --
R:  I see.  So, you don't like to watch TV?
L:  No.
R:  All right.  And, er, that [LAUGH] would be another topic, I think [LAUGH] but [LAUGH], um, I don't watch a lot of sports too but I -- I like, actually watching and playing basketball and now there's the -- the, uh, final [inaudible], I think, um, [NOISE] and they are a interesting day for, uh, [NOISE] basketball [NOISE] watchers but [NOISE] I -- I don't always [NOISE] watch it.  I'm -- I -- I go to the gym and they have the big screen TVs and stand by, um, exercising and working out.  I -- I watch, um, [NOISE] the sports but I don't watch all the games from the beginning to the end.
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  See, yeah, I'm from Europe and, er -- people, er, watch to -- er, used to watch a lot of, um, soccer there but, uh, it's not, um, one of my [several inaudible words] either. [NOISE]
L:  Okay.
R:  And ...
L:  Well, if I were to watch a game --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it would be either basketball or -- or baseball.
R:  Yeah, do you know, er, I don't even know the rules -- the baseball rules.
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  I've never in my life watched a baseball game. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Because we don't have baseball back in Europe.  We --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- don't have it and, er, [NOISE] it's a totally [LAUGH] new game for me and, um, it's interesting because a lot of people are excited about it but I'm n- -- I'm not [NOISE] all -- people I know, are not and it is maybe strange for --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- them that, um, [NOISE] uh, I -- I'm not interested in it but they are [NOISE] -- and it is -- and it is [NOISE] interesting that they are [NOISE] interested in it for me because then I watch it, I don't even understand anything [LAUGH] about it and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, [NOISE] that -- that, er -- that -- that shows, uh, the difference between cultures [NOISE] and, er, [NOISE] information and [NOISE] other things [NOISE] but, um, uh, it is -- sports -- doing sports is something good for health and, [NOISE] um, I would [NOISE] support it.
L:  Right.
R:  Uh, more than watching [NOISE] it and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- er, watching it can come sometimes to [inaudible] and, er -- and they all -- all that they speak about the games and that of like, uh, they are gossiping about it, you know but, er, the game, th- that lasts, uh -- I mean, [NOISE] maybe one hour, later the talk, the speech would last, er, ten hours and [NOISE] millions of people [NOISE] are talking about the game where only ten people were playing.  I mean, it's like a circus, I believe. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Do you like football at all?
R:  [NOISE] Football?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  American [NOISE] football?  I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, it looks nice, er, okay.  They're -- they're so powerful men [NOISE] on the [NOISE] -- uh, er, and, um, but I don't know [LAUGH] the rules either, I don't. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I don't know the rules --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of football, you know --
R:  Y- you --
L:  -- and I guess maybe that's the reason it doesn't interest --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- me that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- much.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, and, uh, to be honest, I don't force myself to learn more about it.  Uh, [NOISE] I didn't force myself [NOISE].  I mean, that would be a new habit and, [NOISE] um, I [NOISE] -- I have enough habits, [LAUGH] I believe and, [NOISE] er, I don't [NOISE] know.  It's [NOISE] -- maybe it's relaxing for me to be in another State and, er, don't knowing a lot about it, [NOISE] therefore I -- I have less stress and that's all.
L:  That could be. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's an interesting way to look at it.
R:  Yeah.  Um, do -- did you, um -- did you watch soccer or something?  Do you -- do you go to the live plays?  To the stadium? [NOISE]
L:  Well, now my -- my little niece --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- has played soccer and I've been to her football -- uh, her soccer game but to really watch --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- professional soccer or anything, no, I don't.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I really don't -- you know, I don't understand the rules of that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- either but -- but --
R:  So, I think in this [NOISE] study then, they find out if, er, maybe [NOISE] if both sides don't know anything about the topic, what would they talk [LAUGH] about and [LAUGH] ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That [LAUGH] -- that prove it is, er -- it's very -- very, er -- not very easy to talk about a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- topic you don't know anything about it and you don't know the person you [LAUGH] are talking to and [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and -- and he or she is from a different [NOISE] culture and [NOISE] different State [NOISE] [LAUGH] ...
L:  Well, that's --
R:  That's --
L:  I guess, they're wanting just more like h- how we act when we talk over the phone and what kind of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- conversations --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- have, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, it -- it's very interesting to me, that these professional --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- players --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- make the money that they --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- make --
R:  Yeah, they make --
L:  -- and --
R:  -- amazing, [NOISE] er, amounts of money but, [NOISE] um, and [NOISE] -- what do you think about this?
L:  Well, I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- personally, I don't think it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's right --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, it's -- to me, I think we're --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- putting our -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, we're showing our children the hero worship in the wrong place.
R:  Yeah --
L:  You know --
R:  -- and it -- it doesn't look like, um, right to me, uh, too, uh, since, [NOISE] er, but ye- yesterday --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I watched, um [NOISE] -- um, documentary about the, uh, Ancient Greece and I learnt that, er -- I found out [NOISE] that, er, even in Ancient [NOISE] Greece -- I mean, two thousand, five [NOISE] hundred years ago, [NOISE] the athletes -- the [NOISE] -- the [NOISE] -- the -- the people [NOISE] who are playing the games were compensated very highly.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah, the State would give [NOISE] them a house.  They -- they wouldn't pay any [NOISE] tax and, um, if they succ- -- [MN] are successful in the, uh -- in the game, they -- they would live a very ni- -- very good a- all their lives.
L:  Right.
R:  And that was the same two thousand, five hundred years ago. [NOISE]
L:  Wow.
R:  So, I said, "There's some sense in it, it must be the same so long" so, um, it's maybe because, their [inaudible] there are the very best and there's only one of the best I mean. [NOISE] And then, er, the people had to -- the money to give to that person and I -- I don't think that this is fair but, um, that's [LAUGH] the way it is.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Would -- when -- when you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- say what they do with --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- with professional sports and how it -- and really, it's no longer a sport, or it's no longer a game maybe, I should --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- say.  It's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's become such a -- a doggy dog situation that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, you know it carries down into --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- those children --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that are just playing --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the sport --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for the fun of it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and yet they can't play it for fun because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- there's a possibility out there that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they might be able to go and play, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- into the bigger sports and to me, that's -- I -- I --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- think we're teaching our children all the wrong things about professional --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- athletes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, they -- they are like stars, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they're like a movie star, like a rock star [LAUGH] or something like that.  They are popular than the -- and, um, they are a role model for the children and I believe you shou- -- uh, people should support, for example, scientists more and scientists should be that nice people, so [NOISE] -- and everybody would appreciate their work, so the children, they, [NOISE] uh, would want to become a scientist or a teacher or a doctor or something like that and, [NOISE] um, the role models shouldn't be the game players.
L:  Right --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- right.  Definitely.
R:  But you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- can change things.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].  Yeah and it -- uh, unfortunately, it just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- seems to be getting worse and worse with -- with everything that goes --
R:  [NOISE]
L: -- on, you know.  It -- first of all, it was a game and then it got to be just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it was worse --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- than a game and then they start betting on it and -- and you know, it -- it's really sad that that's the way our whole culture has gone.  That something that used to be fun --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- can no longer be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a real -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a fun situation.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  [MN]
R:  Um, [NOISE] I don't know.  Do you -- do you know who won in the [NOISE] -- er, the -- the -- who's [NOISE] the NBA champion this year? [NOISE]
L:  No.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] No idea.
R:  [LAUGH] You -- you too. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know either. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, uh, I don't want to know.  I'm not curious about it. [LAUGH]
L:  No, the only -- the only thing that I remotely --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- follow, is -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is the base- -- and I don't even follow the standings really of baseball but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if -- I was born and raised around Cincinnati, Ohio, so, if --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the Cincinnati Reds are playing, you know, I'll kind of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- keep an eye on that, or something like that, or if they're going for the world series, I'll, you know, kind of keep an eye on the paper, to see what happened but to really follow sports --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and say I've got --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- one favorite team that I follow or anything, for any of them, I don't, so --
L:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
R:  I mean --
