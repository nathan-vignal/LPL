L:  Hi there.
R:  Hi.  Are you there?
L:  Yep.  I am.
R:  Yeah, where are you calling from?
L:  Um, Sea- -- well, [MN] around Seattle, Washington.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm, um, in Vancouver in Canada.
L:  Oh, wonderful.  My best friend's actually from Canada.
R:  Yeah, and I love Seattle.  We go down there quite a bit.
L:  Yeah, neat.
R:  [MN] I don't know too much about bioterrorism.  I -- I -- [MN] just lately I'm actually feeling a little bit as if everything's going to be okay.  There was a while ago where I was so worried.  I thought the end of the world was just about coming.  I -- I mean from a US point of view it's probably even scarier, isn't it?
L:  I- y- -- it is, because you never know.  Especially with a lot of the -- the -- we have -- we had just down here not too long ago some children who were building, you know, little home made bombs but it -- it, you know, you can get on the Internet now and find out so much information --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- about building --
R:  -- and you know that these terrorists, ah, you know, they can find out anything they need.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then I thought the way something would happen is something would have to sort of fire at the US or Canada but then I watched a movie where somebody just hid something in a Coke machine.  It was in a stadium.  I can't remember what that movie was but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that really worried me too, that there's so many different ways this could happen.  Like, bioterrorism has got so many different, you know, it can just be, you know, something in the air or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, what -- do you think they're doing much about it?  To prevent it?
L:  Well, you know, it seems like it's -- it's cra- -- it seems like they have done a slight a- amount about it.  I mean, they really got on- onto it when they -- when there was a whole, you know, mail -- mail fear of -- of it, you know.  I've noticed that a lot of our mailmen now down here are wearing gloves and, you know, they're cracking down on that and they seem to be scanning mail more t- -- so that it can prevent --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] I mean, sending stuff through mail is just amazing. [MN]
R:  Yeah, I mean, I actually ... up here I've never even thought of that --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- the ma- -- I've never even worried about it, um, [MN] 'cause it's just different areas where you live, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- terrorism worries me but the bioterrorism is kind of a different thing, isn't it?  That's --
L:  Yeah, and -- and so -- it's such an easy thing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to spread.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, just, you know, a plane flying overhead could drop, you know, it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's so much harder.
R:  And -- and do people in general worry about it a lot more --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- now?  They do.
L:  They -- they -- we -- we tend to -- they sent notes home, um, from sch- -- my child's school --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and, um, about how they'd actually -- they're actually discussing it in school now as well and, you know, we never -- when I was their age I never even had any clue what --
R:  No.
L:  -- that had -- what that was.
R:  Yeah, that's scary.  I mean, I wonder if they particularly wanted people to talk from Canada or the US because you'd have such a different feeling --
L:  Maybe.
R:  -- you know, because -- have you done of these other calls on any other subjects?
L:  No I haven't.  This is actually my first one.
R:  This is my first one, yeah, and it's not a subject I really know a lot about but I'm really -- I am really quite interested to know other people's opinions and if other people are worried about things.  I mean ...
L:  Well, it doesn't -- and we have a lot of news broadcasts a lot of the time and there's -- there's a lot of scares about it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, and I think some people are taking it -- [MN] I mean, there's nothing I per- -- I personally can do about it but I think our g- -- our government is doing what they can --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and getting out as much information as they can.  It's just scary --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because there are so many things.  I mean the Internet's wonderful for the most part but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- on the other hand it, you know, there's so many websites that give m- -- inf- -- too much information, I think --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- about --
R:  So, how -- how do you sort of think people would, if they wanted to do something, would it be like -- i- is that like the small pox, would they call that bioterrorism?
L:  [MN] Yeah, I think they would.
R:  That would be -- 
L:  I mean, be- --
R:  -- 'cause that's -- 
L:  -- there's so many --
R:  -- that's one of my big fears --
L:  Well, yeah there --
R:  -- is something like smallpox.
L:  W- -- yeah, there's -- you get a small, you know, [MN] break into a laboratory or someone that's working in a laboratory that's not honest --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and take something like that.  It would be easy to walk, you know, go to a big stadium where a concert or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or a sporting event was taking place [MN] and, you know, ju- walk by people and just spray it on 'em and they would --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- never know.
R:  Yeah. [MN]
L:  It would be just that easy and it's kind of scary that, you know, I remember when I was younger watching movies about something like that and thinking, "Oh, that's just a movie.  It'll never happen", and here it is. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  It seems to be happening.
R:  [MN] Yeah, or t- -- and then you get really, really worried and then you sort of take a sigh and you think, "Oh, I don't think it's that bad".  You know, I think they, you know the war seemed to, in Iraq, it seemed to, um, resolve things quickly and you think, "Oh, everything's going to be okay", but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know.  It -- I think so many things go on that we don't know about and, ah --
L:  I think so too.  I mean, I -- I'm glad that they don't tell us everything that's going on because --
R:  Yeah, and they don't need to.  I mean, they do not need to tell you everything.  You just --
L:  There is some stuff I think they should tell us less about because --
R:  Yes.  Yeah.
L:  -- I think it gets too many people -- one, it -- it causes fear and it -- and not so much that it causes fear even any more.  It's just that they're giving us too much information about what they're doing about it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, so, the other people find out about it.
R:  Yeah.  That's right, you know, um when that war was going on, i- -- this was so amazing to be told where they were gonna be, what they were gonna do.  I mean, shouldn't --
L:  Exa- -- well, exactly and it -- it gives away our po- -- you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- especially during the war, it gave away a lot of the positioning of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- where we were at --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and they knew where we were at before --
R:  It's crazy.
L:  -- and they're still doing it on -- on the TV.
R:  Yeah.  So, and do people -- do people sort of -- are -- are you care- -- more careful when you open your mail or would -- is that something you would ever think about?
L:  You know, I'm not so -- so -- at first I was a little -- a little -- a little paranoid, I guess.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] but they're -- they've got so many things going right now.  They scan the mail and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- all the mailmen are wearing, you know, gloves.  I just -- I -- I am a little apprehensive sometimes when I get mail from people I don't know but for the most part I guess --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- most of the m- --
R:  I've never even --
L:  -- most of the mail --
R:  I mean, it's just something I just don't think about but, I know, my husband travels to the US every month, like, for a week and I -- I think about airports.  That's where I think that they might try and spread things or do something.
L:  Well, yeah, because there's -- I mean, especially during -- during the holidays --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we were a little concerned because, um, so many people travel during the holidays.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, you know, around Christmas and Thanksgiving the airports are just packed with --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, thousands upon thousands of people and --
R:  It's -- it's --
L:  -- you never know who y- -- who could be being poisoned or whatnot --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- at an airport, you know, a -- a politician or just a mom or --
R:  And then taking it home and spreading it there --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, well, in Canada we have so many different things [MN] happening, there's SARS, the mad cow, there's quite a few, West Nile virus is sort of hitting us now.  I think people are not really thinking about bioterrorism.  I think they're thinking about all those type of things.
L:  Yeah, I think a lot of people now have gone on, like you say, have gone on to start thinking about SARS because it -- [MN] SARS seems to be something that's very scary right now.
R:  Yeah, and I think that's what will kill in -- in the end.  It will be something like that that will kill a lot of people.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, but the bioterrorism threat is -- you know, any terrorism threat is always there.
L:  Yeah, and, I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there will -- people -- people seem to be, you know, they were very -- very worried about it and there -- they seem to be a little bit more laid back about it now --
R:  Yes, yeah.
L:  -- and I think, you know, it -- it'll -- it's only a matter of time before there's another possible scare.
R:  Yeah, something will happen.
L:  About, probably I'd say, probably twice a month there's -- we get a news report that there's a possible anthrax something --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it turns out to be, you know, baby powder or --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- you know, something like that but that's when it reminds us, you know, it could -- it could very well be something like that.
R:  Yeah, now the -- the anthrax, I saw the other day that they thought they had got a -- a real good lead on it or ...
L:  Yeah, it seems like they -- they said that they had it and they weren't sure and th- -- it's back to they have a small lead but they're not releasing any more information --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- which is fine with me. [MN] I mean, I wanna be kept, um, kept informed but at the --
R:  -- Yeah.
L:  -- same time don't give me too much information that the person that you're possibly looking at could figure it out.
R:  That was so overwhelming at that time to have picked that certain time to do it if it was, like, an American or somebody he- -- you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, that was so awful 'cause y- you just assuming it was happening every day then, wasn't it, you know, the --
L:  Yeah, well, and it's -- it w- -- it's so easy to c- -- I mean, it's so easy to travel between countries now --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that, you know, anybody could go up to Canada, come to the United States or go, [MN] you know, down, just about anywhere now, it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- really easy to travel and, I mean, it is kind of hard to get a visa.  They've made it a little bit harder to get a visa and travel outside the country but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, especially going between the United States and Canada it's -- it's [MN] fairly easy.  I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we go up to the border all the time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And we go up there to do a lot of shopping.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, 'cause you have a better deal now. [MN]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, well, we're just going -- I mean, it doesn't stop us.  Like, my husband still travels in the US and we've got three weeks vacation, actually four, 'cause we're going to Hawaii as well and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I just don't think you can let the threat of anything like that, you know, stop what you do.  It does make you think a bit more or --
L:  It does make you --
R:  -- be a bit more --
L:  -- yeah, I think -- I think if people are just a little more -- ah, m- more cautious about what they do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It makes people paranoid then whoever's doing it is winning it in one way or another.
R:  Mm.  I think if you -- like, you've got -- sound like you've got ch- -- you know, young children --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think that 'cause my children are eight, no n- -- ah, nine and eleven.
L:  Yeah.  Ah, my daughter is just about seven and my son's fifteen.
R:  Yeah, I -- I just think about their future, like, what, you know, what things would happen in their future --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- what kind of terrorist attacks.  I mean --
L:  Well, they're so young.  They're too young to start becoming paranoid --
R:  Yeah, but you know --
L:  -- about everything.
R:  -- if you knew what those people wanted.  Is it money?  Is it -- you know, then you could just make everybody happy in the world.  Like, maybe they should spread some wealth.  But it's not that because they've [MN] had lots of money in those countries.
L:  Yeah, a lot of 'em, a lot of those, you know, especially with this whole war that was just going on, you know, it's -- there- there's obviously, you know, part of the nation -- their nation is much more rich than we are.
R:  Yeah, so, it's not that they want.  You know, what --
L:  I think it's just control and power.  It's to be the -- the most -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the biggest kid on the playground, I think, is what they're looking for.
R:  But, you know, when you get people who don't care about their own lives.  You know, at least here the average person, you know, Canadian or American, they -- they might do something bad somewhere but they would want their own lives to be s- -- but when you get people who don't care about themselves then I don't know how you could ever, you know, that's so scary --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, they -- they kill themselves, you know, killing other people, they don't care.
L:  No, not at -- then they don't.  That -- and that, just like you said, that is -- that is really scary because they don't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if they have no regard for their own life then they obviously have no regard for anyone else at all.
R:  Yeah, so then you --
