R:  Hi, this is Andy.
L:  Hi, this is Tammy.  [LIPSMACK] Um, do you wanna go first or do you want me to go first?
R:  I actually missed the question, so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- if you want to tell me what it is.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I was, like, what?  I --
L:  [LAUGH] I know.
R:  -- I, like, went from speakerphone to regular phone.  I'm, like, oh, oh, what?  [MN]
L:  Oh, yeah. [MN] Something about --
R:  I know it's something on bioterrorism, but, ah ...
L:  Yeah, what do you think the government can do to prevent bioterrorism?
R:  Oh, okay.  You can go.  I mean, I actually work in an area, like, I work at, um, [LIPSMACK], where we have the center for public health preparedness and it's like our thing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so, I mean --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- we're already doing it I think.  What we need to do mostly is, like, based on education and [MN] training, you know, we're doing like trainer trainers where we're training all the different people trying to get them to, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, know how to respond and [MN] you know, it's -- I think the government's pretty much doing as best as they can.  I mean, they're dumping money into it left and right and, [MN] um, right now, it just seems like nobody knows what they're doing 'cause it's so new and we just need to train those people and --
L:  Yeah, I think we just have to educate people on bio- -- what it is --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- about what it is and how -- what different kinds there are that they could get their hands on and what to do with it and [MN] have people prepared.  I live in Florida so this is, um, all over the place 'cause we've --
R:  Right.
L:  -- already had about two or three or four scares and now I've just watched the news where they think that there's another cell forming down here to do something here in Florida --
R:  Oh, jeeze.
L:  -- and the FBI are all over the place trying to keep up with it, so, um --
R:  Right.
L:  [LIPSMACK] [MN]
R:  But see then that -- that's scary too.  Like, I think that this country thinks, like, people here think that they need -- that they need to know everything and I don't think they do.  I think that some things need to be kept, oh, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- away from us --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because, you know, you hear about things, like, I'll tell you one thing.  We -- we just did a dirty bombs conference and I always thought, like, listening to the title, I'm, like, oh, that sounds horrible but then --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like when I went to the conference I found out, um, like, they're really kind of just [MN] -- they're just bombs that, um, are meant just to really just irritate people.  I mean, they're not -- they don't -- they're not like bombs like they come in and kill people.  I mean, it's just like a, [MN] um, like a -- it's like a scare tactic and -- and, you know, when you hear stuff like that on the news if they don't tell you what it is then of course you're going to be petrified and --
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
R:  -- they need to, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- keep --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- that out -- of the public.
L:  People down -- yeah, and people down here will go frantic 'cause --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Did everyone go out and buy their plastic and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- um, duct tape?
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  I was laughing.
L:  And before that it was something else, so they were -- they were looking for masks --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and they could do it again, they'll be out looking for their masks.  I know that's what will -- that's what will happen and I think that they're doing, I mean, you're right, they're doing everything that they can do.  They're trying to find out -- they've got people everywhere trying to find out what they have and they're trying to train all -- train peop- -- get people trained just like you are to react if something happens.
R:  Yeah, it just cracks me up that people think they need to know everything.  Like, why would you think that?  I mean, I -- I think there's things that we don't need to know.  [MN]
L:  Yeah, yeah, it's not -- knowing's not gonna prevent it from happening. 
R:  Right.
L:  It's --
R:  What happens if some idiot like find out, oh, this is happening and then making it worse, you know -- 
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  -- by not knowing what they're really doing.  It's like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- just --
L:  Yeah, copycat.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  We can get, yeah.
R:  And that --
L:  Down here we can get a lot of that.
R:  Oh, God --
L:  So ...
R:  -- I'm sure.  
L:  Yeah. [MN] Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  Well, here, I mean it's like DC. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?  [LAUGH]
R:  Like, yeah. [MN]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, great.  
R:  And it's all over.
L:  We're in the best places, aren't we?  Oh, well.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [MN] Oh.
R:  It's crazy.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But, I don't know.  I think people just need to just live their lives.  If you're just a regular person, just go ahead.  Just do what you normally do --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because there's not much you can do.  You can't change things.
L:  No.
R:  I mean [MN], there's crazy people out there and if they're planning to kill then that's the end of it.  That's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what they're planning to do though and --
L:  Yeah, they're gonna do it whether you, um ... no matter what you do they're gonna do what they're gonna do.
R:  I mean, you see these people, like [MN] in other parts of the country where they obviously have nothing in their lives that are worthwhile and they don't care.  They -- they think it's an honor to die for their country, so ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's crazy.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's true and most of the people who deal with this, with the bio stuff, that's exactly how they think, so they don't care if they're working with it and it doesn't go right and it pulls up on 'em -- on 'em and -- they don't care.
R:  Yeah.  Why would they?
L:  No.  
R:  [MN]
L:  Exactly.
R:  It is crazy.
L:  Yeah.  They -- yeah, that's true.  [MN] Mm.
R:  Well, I don't know.  Have you done these --
L:  What el- --
R:  -- before?  [MN] Have you done these before?  Like, for r- --
L:  No.
R:  Oh, me neither.
L:  No.  No.  Not at all.  Someone just suggested it to me and I don't know what else to talk about with this.  
R:  I know.  It's like, is there, like, a -- it's like timed and everything but it's crazy.  It's like ten minutes, like some --
L:  Yeah, I know. 
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  I don't think I've ever talked for that long about anything.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Nothing [MN].
R:  Hey.
L:  You know, 'cause, I -- I mean, you know, other than playing with ideas 'cause you, I mean, you have your opinions and you have your opinions, you know.  It doesn't usually take you that long to dish 'em out but, um --
R:  Right, and plus, like, we're in agreement so it's not like, "Let me convince you of my side of things".  I'm, like, "Oh, I agree".
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.  Mm.  So ... Wow.
R:  But --
L:  That's kind of ironic that you just did that today.
R:  [MN] I know. [MN] 'Cause, like, I was yeah, I made, like, thirty bucks.  I'm like "What?"  Okay. [MN]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm like --
L:  Exactly.
R:  I'll try it.
L:  Exactly.  No kidding. [MN] Um, what else?
R:  I don't know. [MN]
L:  Hm.
R:  Just hope that we all just say -- stay safe, I mean, but, you know, like, y- you think about it, like, our country, we've -- we've gotten away with, like, a --we've never really had a major war here.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, we've only been attacked in -- in one teeny little state of all of our country.
L:  Right.
R:  We've just, I think, like, we're really lucky.  I mean, you see people that are -- like, I work with some people, like, from all over the place and, [MN] you know, it's crazy, it's like, oh, my God, they're, you know, people blow up bombs, like, just in towns like all the time.  It's just like their normal solution, [MN] like. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  So.
L:  And y- -- and you wonder how they li- -- how they live like that as a normal thing.
R:  Yeah, I don't think they care.  They're just, like, ah, whatever.
L:  Yeah, [several inaudible words].  Yeah, I wonder what it would be like to live like that because, I don't know.  It seems kind of strange to always live in fear like that.
R:  I don't think they do though.
L:  Yeah, are they living -- are they -- are they, well, the peop- -- you're either living in fear or you don't care.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.  It doesn't seem like much of a choice to me --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when you're dealing with that.
R:  Plus I think the media makes it way worse than it is 'cause I knew someone who, um, just got back from Israel and I was, like, oh, my God, you know, I cant believe you'd go there and she's, like, ah, you know, people -- people say that about, you know when she comes here.  People are like, oh, my God, you know, DC, crime capital of the world and sh- -- you know, it's like --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- okay, you know, this is where we live and this is just normal for us so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- i- i- it goes both ways I think.
L:  Yeah, I agree.  Well, yeah, I know th- the bad stuff only makes the news.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I mean --
L:  So ...
R:  -- you'll never see good stuff on the news --
L:  Yeah, [MN] exactly. [LAUGH]
R:  It's kind of sad.  
L:  So, yeah, that's true.  Yeah, I knew a f- -- a girl who went over there one time too and, um, you know, they told 'em what to do to be careful and things like that but [MN] she said it was fine.  I mean, she said they saw some things that they wished they hadn't seen but --
R:  Right, I'm sure.
L:  -- um, but oth- other than that it was all right.  [MN]
R:  Yeah, I guess that's just the way it is.
L:  Yeah.  Hm.
R:  [LAUGH] This is too funny.
L:  Yeah and I don't know.  [MN]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] So, what kind of stuff do you -- what kind of things do they train you --
R:  Um, well, I do the --
L:  -- for or prepare you for?
R:  -- finance part of it, so I -- I'm not the trainer but, um, [MN] I mean to say, like --
L:  It's all sorts of different things or do they just -- or do they focus on one thing at a time?
R:  Um, for a while there it was, um, like the big thing for preparedness was like bioterrorism and then they just kind of get into, like, areas like we -- we do a lot of, like, symposiums and teaching, like, for all of the MDAs and [MN] PhDs in the area and -- and --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- um, and then, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the people, like the first response people, like, the, um, um, like the police and the fire and, [MN] you know, we'll have, like a symposium on dirty bombs so they can learn what it is or smallpox and find out, you know, what are the symptoms, what -- you know.  So, people flip out and they think they have it and it's, like, "You have a cold.  Calm down".  I mean --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I- i- --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We had so many calls this one time when, um, [LIPSMACK] I think it was, like, after the [MN] anthrax or something and people, like, "Oh, my God" -- 
L:  Ah, yeah.
R:  -- "I read that, you know, if you have a fever and you have this and that and it's ..." and it was so funny 'cause I would listen to my boss who's MD and she'd say, like, you know, "Do you have a c- -- do you have a fever?" and they'd say, "Yes", and she's like "Then you have a cold, you don't have it".  You know, it's like so many people just immediately, like, think the worst.  It's like, "Oh, my God" --
L:  Yes, exactly, yeah.
R:  Like, calm down.
L:  Ah, see that -- that happened a lot here too especially after they found all the anthrax in that building.
R:  Yeah.
L:  There were peop- -- then, I remember the next week there were people in and out of the hospital.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  Um ...
R:  I have a friend that works, um, she worked in one of the buildings and they were off for, like, three weeks in DC when their -- their building was, like, closed down. [MN] She was, like, "Woo hoo, I got vacation". [MN]
L:  [MN]
R:  Then they couldn't go in, she was, "Oh, oh, well".
L:  Yeah, yeah.  It was like that here too.  It was weir- -- I would drive by there every day for -- by work -- that is -- it was --
R:  Mhm.
L: -- on my route to and from work --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it was, um, [MN] interesting watching them --
R:  I bet.
L:  -- come in and out.  Yeah.
R:  What part of Florida are you in?
L:  -- come in and out.  I'm in southern -- south- southern Florida, like, right in, um, ah, right now I'm -- right now in southern Florida where --
R:  That's cool.
L:  -- around where they were --
R:  Yeah, that's cool.
L:  Yeah.
R:  At least you have nice weather.
L:  Yeah, all the time.  Well, not all the time.  Pret- pretty much all the time. [MN]
R:  We've just been --
