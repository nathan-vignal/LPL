R:  Hello.  Ah --
L:  Hello.
R:  Yes.
L:  Ah, my name is Ronnie.
R:  Hi.  My name's Lisa.
L:  Hi, Lisa.
R:  Hi. [MN] I gotta be honest.  I don't know a lot about bioterrorism. [MN] Not something that I talk about a lot with my friends.
L:  Yeah, me either.
R:  Um, I -- [LIPSMACK], ah, when I think of bioterrorism I think of Iraq and, ah, or, you know, the war in Iraq and they -- they thought they were going to find tons of chemical weapons and -- and they didn't and wh- -- you know, I -- I mean, I'm not opposed to the war in Iraq but, ah, um, I suppose that was one of the things that -- that we could do to feel secure from bioterrorism.
L:  Yeah, that's the first thing I think about too, Iraq and, um, [LIPSMACK] nine eleven.  Oh --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't -- I don't if there's too much that we can really do because, you know, [MN] it has to do with, like, chemicals, they could put it in the air -- 
R:  Right.
L:   -- they could put it in the water system.  You know, they could put it in -- put it, um, in the, um, [COUGH] over the crops and things like that.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So, I mean, if it's not -- I don't know.  I don't think there's too much they could do 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- without changing the way of our life.
R:  Right.
L:  Having everybody pretty much, like, feeling like prisoners. 
R:  [MN]
L:  Scared to eat.  Scared to breathe.
R:  Mhm.  Scared to drink.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I live in a little town and I don't think that [MN] our water supply would be, um, [MN], um, poisoned or compromised but [MN] I wonder if I lived in a bigger town if I thought that I might be a target for that and, ah --
L:  Yeah, I live in a big city.
R:  Oh, there you go.
L:  Yeah, I live in Philadelphia.  
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, it would be sort of easy.
R:  Yeah, well, that's on the east coast.  You gotta lot of -- you got a, it's more of a target area being in a big, um, you know, one -- if you could accomplish one thing [MN] that would affect a lot of people but [MN] I -- I don't know.  I just didn't, ah, until in the last five or ten years I really didn't think about bioterrorism because [MN] living in America we were pretty much safe from [MN] a lot of the stuff and --
L:  I know.  That's what I thought too.
R:   -- and we -- I didn't even pay attention to -- to -- whenever they would talk about military things on the news I didn't pay attention to them [NOISE] until, you know, nine eleven --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then it was all over the news.
L:  I know.  The I -- I think that made everybody, ah, really 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- think about it and really, um, understand how -- how, um, how much a threat it -- real- really was.  
R:  [MN] Yeah.  I just -- I felt guilty that I never paid attention before --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because then whenever there were bombs going off in Jerusalem [MN] then suddenly I was interested [MN] and, ah, I just -- I don't know, I don't think that -- I see biote- -- I don't know what other countries are doing to prevent bioterrorism.
L:  Yeah.  [COUGH]  Now, wh- -- since you said that, that brings up a, um, an interesting point there that I -- I might be able to, um, [LIPSMACK] ah, I think that everybody has to pretty much change inside.
R:  Right.
L:  You know what I mean? 
R:  Right.
L:  If -- if everybody thought about everybody else then it would be different because you said you didn't think about it --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- until --
R:  Right.
L:  You know, you didn't think about it going ov- over Jerusalem or overseas --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but when it started happening over here then you thought about it [MN] and I think that's -- that's a crucial point.  You know, I mean --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- if everybody thinks of everybody else as -- as themselves, then you would, you know, I mean, [LIPSMACK] you wouldn't want to do anything.  You wouldn't want to hurt your mother.  You wouldn't wanna -- wanna hurt your children.
R:  Right.
L:  So, if you thought of everybody else as your family, but that would be -- that would be really hard --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- 'cause everybody would have to change at one time and I think that's sort of impossible too.
R:  And we want to pr- -- we want to protect our children so [MN] it's hard to make them aware that the p- -- that we could die from something we ate, drank or breathed. [MN]
L:  Yeah, 'cause then they would --
R:  But, yet, let them feel safe.
L:  -- make themselves frightened.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  I, yeah, I don't -- I -- I -- I -- I suppose if they kept [MN] -- I -- wh- what I heard on the news when the anthrax sc- -- ah, scare came out was that [MN] apparently places that had anthrax were not very high security.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.  [MN] It would b- -- it was almost like, well, who would want this stuff, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Y- you could die if you touched it, you know.  I- it just wasn't, [MN] I don't know, it just -- it d- -- it d- -- it seemed like, um, if the peop- -- if someone wanted it they could get into, you know, become an educator at that university and get access to it.  You know, it would only take a year or two --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to get access to it so I think maybe better [MN] background checks on -- on, um, on places that -- that -- that are a source of bioterroris- -- um, chemicals and stuff.
L:  Yeah.  [COUGH]
R:  Definitely not something [MN] -- it's a downer, you know and who wants to think about, um --
L:  I know. [MN]
R:  It's -- it's just like a lie.
L:  I know.
R:  You can say a lie --
L:  Yeah, on a daily --
R:  a- --
L:  -- basis.
R:  -- and you can't -- you can't take that back.  It's like trying to prove -- prove something that's not true.  You know, you can prove something that's true, [MN] but how do you prove something that's not true?  How do you stop something [MN], um, from happening whenever it can -- it -- it can happen anywhere.  I mean, just ... and I think the more you think about it, I think it gives some -- it could give people ideas, like, oh, I could -- I can drop this in the salad bar at, ah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- at the, ah, buffet --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- and --
L:  -- 'cause they had a lot of cat- -- copycat --
R:  Right.
L:  -- incidents.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, and that --
R:  Oh, who would even want to copycat --
L:  I know.  That --
R:  -- anthrax.
L:  -- that made me, um, [LIPSMACK] that made me really, really, like, um, upset, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because if -- if you have a lot of, um, we have a lot of criminals anyway --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and then you have people j- just doing it for fun --
R:  [MN] Right.
L:  -- you know, just to see how -- people's reactions and see how -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you know --
R:  I know, I'm --
L:  -- what's gonna happen, so ...
R:  I'm -- I'm in western Maryland, so a lot of my mail goes -- goes -- goes through DC and, um, [MN] some of the things went through the Post Office, ah, from, I don't know, like, my auto insurance and stuff would go through the Post Office that [MN], um, was shut down --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, for -- closed down for anthrax [MN] and that -- that makes you wonder.  I -- I certainly wouldn't want to think that -- and then I thought, oh, I should have just switched to, um, you know, computer billing and stuff and -- and that's -- I was thinking for a while there every piece of mail that came in, you know, for the first -- first few days of that anthrax that could be -- I could be bringing something into my house with this and I was looking at my mail, like, "Do I need this?", you know, "Do I need magazines?"  Do I need to have, you know, get my electric bill.  Why don't just have it, au- -- you know, automatically deposited?  But I do- -- I mean, I don't want to live in fear.
L:  Yeah.  It really, like, changes --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- changes your -- your -- your whole -- your whole, um, y- your feeling of security --
R:  Right.
L:  -- feeling of confidence as far as being able to go and come a- as you please and take care of your family --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and just -- just be able to -- to, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, just live -- live a life and -- and accomplish what you want to.  It just -- it just makes you feel -- makes you feel like -- like you have to look over your shoulder.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You have to worry about it.  I think my-- my biggest issue is the children.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You don't wanna -- you don't -- you want your children to be safe but you don't want your children to be frightened, you know, afraid to live and -- and -- and, ah, afraid to, um, to -- to -- to -- to feel as though they think they live in America and they can --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you know, live the American dream.  You can -- you can get up every morning and have a job or have your own business, be successful, take care of your family, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  --go out and have, be -- be entertained without having to worry about these things.
R:  [MN] Right.  I -- I think that -- that's what the terrorists are trying to shatter, that American dream and I -- I can only imagine what it would be like to live in a country where it's -- it's poor and it's desolate and people being always killed or maimed and [MN] murdered or raped and then look at Americans and just think, oh, you know, boy when someone rapes someone there they go to jail for fifteen years --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and here, you know, they just do it and, you know, the authorities laugh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, ah, I -- I -- I guess I can see [MN], you know, their motive, just -- I don't know, I don't want to say jealousy but, [MN] just having that freedom and but with freed- freedom [MN] comes a lot of, and here's what we realised, chances for people to commit terrorist attacks.  I mean, when there's [MN] armed guards in the, um, air f- -- ah, i- in the airports you're, I don't know, I would think that's more intimidating, that -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that maybe you wouldn't try to, um, [MN] --
L:  Yeah, but they -- they --
R:  -- do something wrong.
L:  -- have a different belief system than we do altogether.
R:  Right.  Yeah --
L:  So, they --
R:  -- that's true.
L:  -- 'cause when -- when -- when they first -- when the first terrorist attacks, I couldn't understand, like, why would they do it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but then when, um, [LIPSMACK] when, you know, I did a little research and I -- and I, ah, listened to some people talk about it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they have a different belief system so, you know, they -- their -- their whole life is different than ours.
R:  That's right.
L:  And if you live in poverty all your life, you -- you're -- you're motivated by, you know, [MN] different -- different things --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to get money for your family --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to -- to -- to, ah, go down in -- in history as a hero.
R:  [MN] Yeah, that's a chance for s- -- for anyone to become, just in their own mind or in the mind of their families, you know, just lifted up and -- and famous but [MN] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, they do that but they -- they don't get -- they don't even take credit for it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, no one will say, [MN] um, like Osama bin Laden, ah, and bin -- bin Laden arranged it and then he went into hiding.  I mean, [MN] he's a coward but yet he tries to say he's so brave for his religion but he hides behind it.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [MN] I don't know what that has to do with bioterrorism but, you know, when I think abut terrorism, I think Middle East, I think --
L:  That's what I think of because --
R:  Nobody in America would want to do that.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I think there's some people in America who -- 
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- are capable --
R:  -- that's true.  That's --
L:  -- who are capable for -- for whatever reasons.  I think -- I think the two main things for change is we -- everyone needs to be more empathetic, at least to try to fill each other's [MN] --
