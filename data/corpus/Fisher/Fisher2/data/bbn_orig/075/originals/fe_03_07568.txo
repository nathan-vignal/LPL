L:  I'm Laura.
R:  Hi.  I'm Lisa.
L:  Hi, Lisa.
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  You too.  What was the sport?
R:  Um, it think any kind of TV sport.
L:  Okay, 'cause I --
R:  Or -- or --
L:  -- couldn't hear that.
R:  I guess anything that you would sit and watch on TV.  
L:  Oh, good deal.  So what do you watch?
R:  Well, I like um ice skating in the winter.
L:  Figure skating or anything?
R:  Uh, figure skating and --
L:  So do I.  
R:  -- let's see?  Summer time, I like track and field events.  You know, if there's something special on.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  How about you?
L:  Um, well, we -- my family is really big into baseball. 
R:  Okay.
L:  Especially right now.  I've got, uh, a five year old and a seven year old that are both playing baseball.  My five year old went to his first professional baseball game --
R:  Oh, what a thrill.
L:  -- and we watched that on TV and tried to -- tried to see them, but couldn't.
R:  [LAUGH].  Well --
L:  But uh -- so we've been watching that.  Um, during the -- let's see.  During the winter, I like to watch the figure skating, um, football.  That's a big one.
R:  Yeah.  I like the college football.
L:  Uh, ours is professional.  Um, although hopefully we'll be able to see my cousin, who is going to Dayton, Ohio for college.
R:  Oh, great.
L:  And he's gonna try -- pardon me -- and get on the football team there, so hopefully we'll be able to see him play.
R:  So what college is that?
L:  [MN].  Pardon?
R:  What college is he going to?
L:  Uh, Dayton.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Dayton College.  So hopefully we'll be able to watch that, um --
R:  So you'll have a special interest, then, in following their games?
L:  Right.  
R:  Great.  
L:  So um but yeah, and my -- my seven year old wants to play on the White Sox.  So --
R:  Oh, neat.  Well, I think it's fun to go and see baseball in person.
L:  Yeah, it --
R:  You know, it -- it -- I think it's better in person.
L:  It is better in person.  I used to -- growing up, I hated watching it.  I hated watching it on television, and then as I got older and my kids got, you know, into watching it and then into playing it, then of course I married somebody who likes to watch it, so --
R:  Oh, I -- okay, that would make a difference, then.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Um --
R:  I have as much fun watching the crowd at the games as I do the ball players, especially if it's -- the game's going kind of slow, you know, I'm looking around and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, you're watching the guys throwing the peanuts and everything and just --
L:  And watching to see what everybody else --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- is doing.  Yeah.  I like doing that, too.  It's um -- it's always fun seeing, you know, everybody's reaction --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to what's going on and --
R:  That's right.  
L:  And uh how they -- how they enjoy the game and what's not fun, though, is when you get the people that have a little too much to drink.
R:  Oh, yes.  They can be obnoxious.
L:  Yeah.  You know, they've had a couple of -- a couple of incidences where people have come out and just beat the snot out of somebody for no reason.
R:  Oh, my.  That's not good for kids to see I don't think.
L:  No.
R:  No.
L:  And they -- they do it all -- you know, I don't like my kids seeing that kinda stuff, but the again at the same time, they watch wrestling --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- which could be considered a sport, I guess.
R:  Yeah.  That's true.  
L:  But, you know, I -- I make sure that I take the time to tell them, you know, this isn't real, this is fake and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and explain to them what's going on so that they know that you can't go up to somebody and whack them in the face with a chair and them not get hurt.
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah, that's just entertainment and that's about it.  [LAUGH].
L:  Right.  
R:  So what else do you watch on TV as far as sports?
L:  [SIGH].  Um, well I guess we watch wrestling, I guess that can be considered a sport, depending --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- on who you talk to.
R:  Mhm.  That's true.
L:  Um, because you know, the professional -- professional wrestling now is for entertainment purposes anyway.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, baseball, football, um --
R:  I like to watch golf on Sunday afternoon.  It's --
L:  My husband has started getting into watching golf.
R:  And I don't play golf, but it's -- it's real relaxing and it's kinda neat, you know?  Back the other day I turned it on and -- and I don't remember who the player was, but he hit a shot towards a cup and it came up over this little rise and it went right in the hole.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, and he was so excited.  And the crowd --
L:  That was -- was that --
R:  -- cheered.
L:  -- from the Western Open?
R:  I think it was, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And uh it's just really neat to see that.  And you know, they're such gentlemen and ladies out there and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, it's different than other sports where, you know, maybe there's more violence and --
L:  Right.  
R:  -- people that um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- aren't very sportsman like.
L:  Right.  And it's -- now you get a lot of that.
R:  Yeah, that's right.
L:  And that's, you know -- I think that's very depressing to see that there isn't as much sportsmanship as there used to be.  
R:  Yeah, I agree.  Kinda like --
L:  You know, and there used to be --
R:  -- everybody's out for themselves.  You know, it's all about me, me, me and I don't know, it's --
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  It's uh -- it seems like a lot of these uh players are, you know, highly paid sports people --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, it -- it's all about --
L:  You can tell the ones --
R:  -- me.
L:  -- that are getting paid too much.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, they've let it go to their head and you know, it's an ego thing I guess.
L:  Right.
R:  Uh, but --
L:  Yeah, you can always tell the ones that are getting paid too much because they seem to have a certain um disposition or a certain attitude about them --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that you don't see with the ones that aren't getting paid as much.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  You know?  Um --
R:  I think sports should -- should be fun and it should be enjoyable and you know, not everybody's gonna win and you're gonna have a bad day and, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- every now and then, but you know, I think you need to be sportsman like and -- and be a good role model for the kids.
L:  Yeah, and that's -- that's just it, too.  So many kids nowadays are -- are looking at sports figures --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- as role models.
R:  Right.
L:  And I had one teacher at one point in time tell me that those aren't the people you want to look up to because they're not perfect, they don't lead perfect lives and a lot of kids thought that.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?
R:  That's true.
L:  And he goes, "Those aren't the people that you want to look up to".  The people you want --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to look up to are the people who touch your life and -- and um -- you know, basically -- basically touch your life.  The people who support you in things that you do.  Those are the people --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- you wanna look up to.
R:  Yeah, like mom and dad and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- grandma and grandpa and --
L:  Teachers.
R:  -- you know, your -- yeah.  Your brother and sister and, you know, extended family, that kinda thing.
L:  Right.  And --
R:  'Cause they're the ones who are there for you when things aren't going well and --
L:  Right.  
R:  -- and you know?
L:  At least you hope, anyway.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].  
L:  But uh, yeah.  I -- I uh -- you know, there was an incidence with uh Sammy Sosa, and having a corked bat --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- and he immediately came out and apologized.  You know, saying that that's the bat that he uses for his practice and -- and you know, he doesn't -- he doesn't use cork[?] bats.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  They took seventy six bats including I think five out of the Hall of Fame to uh -- actually um, to see if --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- there was cork in 'em.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  And not a single one of them had cork.  He still got suspended for it, which he should have because, you know, you're not supposed to use a corked bat.
R:  I see.
L:  But a lot of fans got really upset with him and I'm sitting here thinking it was an honest mistake, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  All his bats are painted black so you couldn't see if there was uh any -- you know, any foreign substance that was placed in there or anything.
R:  Right?
L:  And uh --
R:  Makes you wonder if somebody put it there illegally, you know?
L:  Yeah.  It makes you wonder if somebody -- somebody was trying to get him in trouble.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  And uh he got suspended for eight games and they revised it to seven games because of his quick apology.
R:  Right.
L:  And explanation of why that bat was there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Which I thought was decent.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  But uh you know, it's -- it's hard.  I know um --
R:  Well --
L:  I used to watch basketball when um -- when the Chicago Bulls were doing their uh -- you know, it was Tony Cucoach[?] and -- and Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippin[?], Denis Rodman --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they were, you know, champions, but I haven't really watched them since that.  How about you?
R:  Are you still there?
L:  Yeah, I'm still here.  How about you?
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I am.  [LAUGH].  You were fading in and out and so I didn't know --
