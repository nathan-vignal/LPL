R:  Hi, this is Marguerite.
L:  Hi, this is Christine.
R:  [MN].
L:  This is my first call, so I'm not quite sure what to do.
R:  I know.  It's mine, too.
L:  [LAUGH].  Okay, I -- what is the topic of the day, your favorite T.V. sports?
R:  Yeah, do you have one?
L:  Ah well, once in a while I watch horse racing and gymnastics.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.  
L:  How about you?
R:  Um, well my husband watches golf so sometimes I watch it when he watches it.  
L:  Yeah, the --
R:  But --
L:  -- one I hate is football.  I hate football season.
R:  Oh, I hate football, too.  [LAUGH].  
L:  I hate it when football season's on 'cause --
R:  [MN].
L:  -- that's all that's plastered all over the television.
R:  Mhm.  I don't understand it so I think that's probably my problem [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  I like baseball, too.
L:  What team you go for --
R:  But -- well, the Cleveland Indians. 
L:  Ah.
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  Well, well they gotta be better than the Cubs, so --
R:  Well, I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH].  
R:  But --
L:  We have to talk for ten minutes?
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  So do you watch horse racing at all?
R:  Actually, um probably the last time I did that was, like, in the seventies 'cause my uncle -- I used to live in California and my uncle used to watch it.
L:  Oh.  
R:  But [LAUGH] --
L:  You don't -- we're in Virginia, so this is like horse country.
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  So we watch it --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- once in a -- like, the Grand Prix and the Kentucky Derby.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Just once in a while there's a horse that comes out of Virginia that goes into some of those.  But -- you don't watch ice skating or anything?
R:  Yeah.  I like ice skating.  Um, have you ever heard of Cedar Point?
L:  No.
R:  Oh, okay.  They have -- it's a -- an amusement park and we have an ice skating show with Snoopy and stuff.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  It's really cute.
L:  We have Icecapades here in the winter time.
R:  Oh, that sounds like fun.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  We have 'em -- I don't -- my kids are too young to go to something like that, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we see the ice skating on the T.V. for the commercials for it.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  So --
R:  But I like to watch couples skate rather than -- you know singles.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  We watch the Olympics when they come on.
R:  Yeah.  That's what we --
L:  My --
R:  -- do too.
L:  My husband's from Australia so, you know, when it was down in Australia, in Sydney, they were really watching it then.
R:  Oh, I bet.
L:  So --
R:  [LAUGH]. 
L:  Ah, do you watch bobsledding?
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Um, is that like the luge?
L:  Like the little --
R:  Where they --
L:  -- sled that goes real fast down the hill?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, we watch that too.
L:  Yeah, I just watch to see people crash.
R:  Mhm.  We like --
L:  That would be painful.
R:  -- the extreme skiing and all that.
L:  That would be very painful.
R:  Oh, I know.  But like, we like to watch um like in the -- like in the Winter Olympics when they have the extreme skiing and they do all the flips and stuff.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Those are interesting.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I can watch that.  I can't watch the downhill skiing though.  That's kinda boring.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Um, do you have skiing where you're at?
R:  Yeah.  I've never skied though, but they have um probably about forty five minutes away, they have a big resort and stuff, where people ski and see, um, I'm right on Lake Erie.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So there's water jet skiing and --
L:  Are you -- what are you, in Michigan?
R:  I'm in Ohio.
L:  Ohio?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm from Chicago.
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  I'm from there, so we have that --
R:  Yeah, that's only six hours away from here.   [LAUGH].
L:  That's not bad.
R:  No.
L:  We're in Virginia now, so that's like, what is it, a fifteen hour drive from here to Chicago.  
R:  Oh, that's not too bad.
L:  Yeah.  With a three year old and a eleven year old in the car?
R:  Wha-
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Well, okay, yeah.  I understand.  [LAUGH].
L:  So, my eleven year old plays football.
R:  Oh. 
L:  Yeah, he and his dad are big into football.
R:  No wonder you don't like it [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.   Yeah.  Um, my dad -- growing up, my dad was real big into the Redskins.
R:  Oh.  
L:  So um that was always on T.V.
R:  Do they have football in Australia?
L:  Um, it's a different kind of football.  They don't --
R:  Is it a soccer?
L:  No --
R:  Like soccer?
L:  No.  They have a -- it's a regular football, doesn't look like ours, though, that -- and they don't throw it to pass it, they kick it.
R:  Oh, that's weird.
L:  Yeah.  They kick -- they kick the ball.  Like, um, my stepson, the eleven year old, he can kick about forty or fifty meters.
R:  Wow.
L:  So he's the team punter.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  So, but we have to go to every game.
R:  Does he have football camp and all that kind of stuff for summer?
L:  Yeah.  Yep.  
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  But he doesn't like doing it, though, 'cause you know, that takes time away from the couch.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And the T.V.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  So -- but then it gets really hot, 'cause they don't do that until the end of July.
R:  Oh.
L:  So my daughter's in gymnastics.  
R:  Oh, that's neat.
L:  So I -- I try to keep it on the T.V. so that she can watch it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  With all those cable shows, there's always gymnastics somewhere.
R:  That's funny, 'cause um we have a six month old little girl --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and um I was talking about how flexible she was the other day and as if she could be a gymnast.  [LAUGH].
L:  That's a cute age.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's like the perfect age.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They don't really move too fast, they can't tell you "no".
R:  I know.
L:  [LAUGH].  
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Does she sleep through the night yet?
R:  Um, pretty much.
L:  Oh, aren't you lucky?
R:  Yeah.
L:  My three year old still doesn't sleep through the night.
R:  Well, we have a two year old too, and he doesn't.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  He wakes up and gets in our bed.
L:  Does he really?
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  My daughter just gets up screaming.
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  And we finally got her off the bottle.  Of course, this is nothing on the subject we're supposed to be talking about.
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  They should of had men do this.
R:  Well, I think that's what they're trying to do.  The -- the subject, 'cause I saw on the internet today that um, mm, they're looking for men.  More men to talk.  
L:  Oh.
R:  But --
L:  Well, I should of let my husband take the call.
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  'Course, he's Australian and doesn't know much about American sports yet.
R:  Well, does he know the Wiggles?  [LAUGH].
L:  Yes.  Yes, he knows the Wiggles.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  He uh -- he went over for a visit and brought a whole bunch of Wiggles tapes back.
R:  Did he really?
L:  And I was, like -- it was before my daughter was even a year old.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I was, like, that's right, get her involved in the T.V.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  That'll really work.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, but -- yeah, the Australian football, they don't wear padding.  At all.
R:  Oh, they don't?
L:  Nope.  They don't wear helmets, they don't wear padding.  They wear shorts.
R:  Wow.
L:  And, like, tank tops.  
R:  Oh, that's kinda weird.
L:  So -- yeah.  And they don't wear mouth guards.  My husband has uh -- most of his mouth are full of fake teeth.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  'Cause they knock your teeth out.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  And his knee's all messed up.  So it's a rough sport.
R:  Are the guys real big, like they are, you know, in the U.S. football, or are they --
L:  No.  No, they're fit.  Like, real fit.
R:  Oh.  Like soccer players out here, probably?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Wow.  That's weird.
L:  Yeah.  And it just kills me how they don't wear padding, but yet they, you know, tackle each other and everything.  Like, what are you?  Idiots?
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  This is a football game.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  You gotta tackle somebody.
R:  Is that like their national sport?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.  I've never heard of that.  That's weird.
L:  Yeah.  They call it football.  
R:  Oh, that's funny.
L:  Yeah.  So they -- we -- once in a while, we get it on a cable show.  And he wants me to sit down and watch it and I have no idea what the rules are.  
R:  That's how I am with American football.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
R:  I'm always, like, "Why is he running?"
L:  [LAUGH].  
R:  "Why'd they call a time out?  I don't understand".
L:  Yeah.  See, I can't even sit and watch American football.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Like, you know, this is boring to me.
R:  Yeah.  It's boring to me, too.
L:  I just couldn't do it.  And cricket.  My husband's a big cricket fan.  Have you seen cricket before?
R:  Um, is that kinda like where they have, like, a big stick?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Is it like baseball kind of, but they have --
L:  They hit the --
R:  -- a stick?
L:  Yeah.  But the stick is, like, on the ground.
R:  Oh, okay.  Like a golf -- like a um -- golf club?
L:  You hit it like a golf --
R:  Or something?
L:  -- cl- club, and then instead of running to bases, you run back and forth as many times as you can.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Like, straight forward and straight back to the bases.  
R:  Oh, that's weird.
L:  Well, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  And they call them wickets.  You gotta run back and forth to the wickets.  
R:  Well, then how --
L:  And they --
R:  -- do they -- how do you win?  [LAUGH].
L:  Whoever's got the most points.
R:  Oh, so each -- like each time that they run back and forth, they get a point?
L:  Well, one -- if you run from here to the next point, that's one point and then if you run back, that's another point.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Kind of a dumb game.  I don't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- really get that one either.  So --
R:  Well, my husband can sit and watch golf all day.
L:  Oh, my gosh.  Now, that's a boring sport [LAUGH].
R:  I know.  
L:  Do you play golf here?
R:  No.  
L:  No.  I play mini golf [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.  I can do that.
L:  My husband played golf in Australia, but he uh doesn't like the courses out here.  He says they're different.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're probably easier.
L:  Yeah.  He -- when he was growing up and he was a teenager, he played golf against Greg Norman.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  When they were, you know, kids.  So I guess, you know, Greg Norman's a lot better than my husband was.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  'Cause he's got all that money.
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  So --
R:  Well, my husband tries to play at least once a week. 
L:  Does he really?
R:  Yeah.  He says it's a stress reliever.  Huh.  To me, it would be more stressful.  I can't hit the ball at all.
L:  Neither can I.
R:  So -- 
L:  Neither can I.  Yeah, that game I don't like it.  I don't like watching that game.
R:  I know.  He falls asleep halfway -- well, you know, while watching it so -- when he wakes up, he says, "Oh", you know, and he could totally keep track of what's going on.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Out here, they had the big Kemper[?] Open.  You heard --
R:  Is that a golf thing?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  The traffic was so banked up, it wasn't even funny.
R:  Oh, they have a big thing in Toledo, you know um, Jamie Farr from MASH.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, he has a -- the Jamie Farr Classic in Toledo.  It's a big deal.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Well, you know about the traffic?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Just taking people -- I had a friend that went to the Kemper Open and it took him two hours to get out of the parking lot.
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  Like, why didn't you just stay home and watch it on T.V. [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  "What are you, an idiot?"
R:  So he actually went to the -- to the game --
