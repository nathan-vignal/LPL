L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  I'm Mary.
R:  Hi.  I'm Becky.
L:  Hi, Becky.  How are you? [MN]
R:  I'm good.  How did you find out about this study?
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] well, I saw it in a newspaper ad.
R:  Okay.
L:  And yourself?
R:  Well, I found it on, um, I belong to this, um, [LIPSMACK] oh, I don't know, it's probably a group of a bunch of woman that, ah, you pay eleven bucks for a year and then you get told of all these deals, like contests and --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- things at Walgreen and things at Target and all that and -- and there was all the buzz about this Fisher call study so I thought I'd sign up for it. [MN]
L:  Oh.
R:  So, how many calls have you done?
L:  Ah, this is only my second although my first was quite a while ago.  I -- I kind of forgot about it and I thought --
R:  Oh, yeah?  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I thought, oh, I better do that other -- those other calls.
R:  Yeah, really.
L:  'Cause when I'm always ready to call it's too late.  You know --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- it's like eleven --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- o'clock Pacific, so --
R:  Ah. [MN]
L:  You know, it's like --
R:  Yeah, usually I'm the opposite so I have to make sure I call in [MN] --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- 'cause when they call me it's so inconvenient.  I've got two kids and -- and it's usually hard to schedule it, so -- so --
L:  Mm, there you go.
R:  -- this time I tried twice today to get through to someone and it took me forty five minutes each time.
L:  Get outta here.
R:  So, I just hung up.  I decided to try one more time today. [MN]
L:  Really?  Oh, 'cause with me, just now, it was a second.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, it only took me a second to get through to you but I -- I wonder if it's because of the topic.  Is everybody afraid of talking about it or doesn't want to talk about or ...?
L:  Oh, I don't know.  Are you east coast?
R:  Well, we're in Iowa.  So, I'm in central.
L:  So, you're in central.  Okay.  Oh.
R:  Yeah, so it's about fi- -- five o'clock now.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, well, you know that it's interesting 'cause the topic is, I mean, I really don't know that much about bioterrorism --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but it's -- it's one of those taboo scary things.
R:  Yes.
L:  You know, and -- and I mean, what are we supposed to do about it?  I don't know. [MN]
R:  Yeah, I know, and if you really tell, tell your views to someone else on the phone, you're like, "Well, is big brother listening?"  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  If you want -- if you want to tell him the real thoughts that you have --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you're well, maybe we should get rid of all the people there, you know, or whatever.
L:  Bomb -- bomb 'em all.
R:  Yeah, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then you wonder, well, okay, is the government on your side, or are they gonna come over to take you out of your house or what?
L:  Frankly, I don't think the government knows either.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know --
R:  I don't think they know what to do either.
L:  No, it's pretty scary.
R:  Yeah, it is scary.  It's probably not as, ah, I don't know, maybe it's not as worrisome as -- as [MN] some of us are led to believe but, I don't know, it's still a scary thing.  I think we're more susceptible to, you know, bombs and whatnot --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- than the bioterrorism stuff.
L:  But the -- but the [MN] -- if -- if it -- the -- I mean, the thing is though, if it leaks out, the bioterrorism spreads immediately.
R:  True.  True.
L:  You know.
R:  Like the -- the w- water supply, you know.  Anybody can get a job at a waste treatment plant or a water treatment plant --
L:  Probably.
R:  -- and dump something in there.  You know, even a janitor could.
L:  Mm, mm, yeah --
R:  That's --
L:  -- I -- it's -- it's -- it's kind of beyond, well and then -- and then, aren't they talking about small pox and things like that too?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  And I don't know exactly what it all -- you know, but ah, [MN] I -- you know, I -- I think it's -- it's -- it's a little -- a shame, a little too bad what the -- what the news has been doing to Tony Blair and Bush about, "Well, they said they were supposed to find things and --"
R:  Oh.
L:  "-- they haven't found things".
R:  I know, please!
L:  You know, and [MN] I mean, better to be -- better to be cautious --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- in this scenario, I would say. [MN]
R:  Yes.  You know, I'm -- I'm really glad we haven't found anything.  You know, that -- that's really a goo -- that's god news, you know, 'cause that means maybe we wouldn't have been targeted by the -- the Saddam guy but [MN], you know, whether or not we found him I don't think at this point is -- is a relevant issue because of the humanitarian effort.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, all the people that were so -- so repressed and tortured over there and now we've stopped that.
L:  Hopefully.  They're s- --
R:  Hopefully.
L:  -- they're still kind a, oh, I don't know, the whole thing is just -- it's -- it's -- you know, you hate to say "Thank God I'm not there" but [LAUGH] ...
R:  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah, it makes you happy that you live in this country.
L:  [MN] Yeah, except everybody's coming over to this country --
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  -- that's the problem.
R:  I know and that's the thing is we've opened borders.
L:  I know, pretty much.
R:  It's, ah -- there's really no -- no answer to it any more because we are a big melting pot for anybody to come.
L:  But the thing is, you know, everybody all over the world bitches about America and yet they're try- -- they're dying to --
R:  Get here.
L:  -- come here.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Literally.  I mean, look at the Cubans --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, just hiding out and waiting to hit the sand, you know.
R:  Yeah, that's right.  
L:  I mean.
R:  That's right.  And we just had a rail car, um, ah, oh, it must have been three months ago filled with twenty, maybe thirty, I don't know, [MN] dead Cubans or Mexicans, I'm not sure who they were, but they all suffocated in there.
L:  Oh, you mean they were being transported across the country --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in a car?
R:  Yeah, and -- and the car ended up just, like, not off the tracks but just sitting there and -- and the authorities after, like, three days were like, "Wh- what's going on with this?" and they noticed a smell and they went over there and these people are, like, [MN] decayed in there.
L:  No!
R:  Yeah, and they finally identified 'em all and --
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  And, but, yeah, they were illegal immigrants trying to get in our country and -- and -- [MN] --
L:  But, ah, if they've already made it to Iowa where -- where d- -- how did they get in, I mean, that ...?
R:  Right.  Right.  That's a long --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- long way away from any border.  [MN]
L:  Yeah, really, that's the heartland.
R:  Yeah, so, I mean, you're right.  Everybody complains about our country but yet they wanna get here.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  Oh, man! [LAUGH]
R:  But I can't imagine what it would be like living in another country, you know, walking on the street with your child and then a cafe across the street blows up.
L:  I know.
R:  No, how do you explain that to a three or four year old?
L:  I know, but they l- -- they -- they grow up with it and they live with it.
R:  Yeah, they grow up with it.
L:  It's so sad, I know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's so sad and then they -- the Americans or whoever else that wants to live over there, I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, ah.
R:  Well, you know, I guess you gotta say, well, you know, it's your choice to go ahead and go but if you're gonna go live over there I -- I don't have a lot of, well, not pity for you, but I don't --
L:  Mm.
R:  I -- you know, you --
L:  Sympathy. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I don't [MN], yeah, you're --you're doing this to yourself.  You might as well stay over here.  Don't go over there.
L:  Mm.
R:  But ...
L:  Don't ask for the trouble, you know.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Exactly.  Don't go looking for trouble.  
L:  Yeah, I mean, as far as like, the -- the topic probably is kind of scaring people, like, "I don't know anything about it".
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, so they probably just hang up but I -- I guess the real thing that they're -- it's not really as much the content of the conversation but they're more looking at the linguistics as far as what I understand.
R:  Yeah.  How to communicate.
L:  Well, not even that.  I think it's more accents and t- -- intonation and things like that.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  From when I first called and -- and, you know, was inquiring about it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's more, you know, someone down south would s- -- obviously speak differently than --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- someone else and that sort of thing, so --
R:  Ah, yesterday I talked with a gentleman on, ah, vacations or holidays or something [MN] --
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  He was German and Turkish.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Whew, that was a long ten minutes.
L:  Ooh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, my first conversation actually was with a -- was with a guy and he was like Middle Eastern too --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and he was like a student somewhere in -- in maybe Virginia or something and this guy could not spit it -- he had the worst stuttering in the world --
R:  Oh, boy.  Ooh.
L:  -- it was scary.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I was, like, "Oh, my God, the poor guy".
R:  Yeah.  Why me, why me? [LAUGH]
L:  I know, poor guy.  But that's exactly like what they said.  They said they -- they wanted to notice, say, someone who came from another country and learned English --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- and -- and their -- their intonations versus everybody else.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, I think that was ... it's -- it's more the linguistics than the t- -- than the content, I think.
R:  Okay.  Well, good [LAUGH] --
L:  So, yeah --
R:  -- 'cause I don't really want to talk about bioterrorism.
L:  I know.  I know.
R:  I mean, I -- I'm a stay at home mom but I used to be a microbiologist or rather I -- I used to be a scientist over at Pioneer which is a big seed company. [MN]
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I know a little bit about it but, you know, it's just -- [MN] it's really [MN] no matter how much you know about it, there's really nothing you can do about it.
L:  Mm.
R:  'Cause if somebody has the technology to develop the anthrax or the -- the -- the water -- waterborne illnesses --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they're gonna use it.
L:  [MN]
R:  All we can do is -- is -- is prevent -- ah, is not prevent it but have solutions to it when it happens.  
L:  Right, but, of course, that does mean planning.  [MN]
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah and our government doesn't typically plan for, um, those type of problems until they've happened.
L:  Yeah, well in the past and that's why we've gotta change --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for the future, for the now.
R:  Yeah, and that's why we need to allocate some money and we're -- we're still not doing it.
L:  Ye- -- well, yeah and then, where are we gonna get the money?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And how many more taxes can we pay?
R:  Oh God, I know.
L:   [MN] Right. [MN]
R:  I know.  We just pay so much already.  
L:  And -- and how many more things can get cut that we need?
R:  Yeah, like -- like education, you know, hello! 
L:  Mhm.  Mhm. 
R:  That's -- that's our future.
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.
R:  Yeah, and the teachers --
L:  And the teachers get the bummest rap, don't they?
R:  Yeah, they do.  They do.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  You got movie stars and basketball players making, you know, they can afford a -- a big limo or a Rolls Royce and -- and you got teachers that can't even afford to have someone cut their grass.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's just -- it's backward.
L:  Mhm.  Exactly.
R:  Yeah and how much more can we cut something?  You're right.
L:  Right, exactly, exactly.  So -- 
R:  So, where do you live?
L:  -- so, we need to protect our kids though, don't we?
R:  Oh, God yes.
L:  Oh.
R:  Whether it's bioterrorism or for their future.  It's just, um --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you know, with all the abductions and all that these days it's --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- pretty scary.
L:  Really scary, yeah, yeah.  Terrible.
R:  So, where do you live?
L:  I'm in southern California.
R:  Oh, wow.  How nice.
L:  Ah, yeah, it is but, man, everybody and their brother lives here.  [MN]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Do you know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I was saying that to somebody who was a native, which of course there's not that many natives --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- last night.  I said the problem is is that I -- I don't do a lot of the things that I'd like to do just because of the traffic and the --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- congestion and the people.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.  So ...
R:  Yeah, very true.  And are you, like, how -- how far south?  San Diego or further?
L:  A little bit north of that.  I'm --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- in a, um, a real nice area that, ah, kind of, ah, pretty close to the coast and the -- basically the Newport Beach area.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, I'm -- I'm probably -- I'm a little bit closer to LA than San Diego but I'm kind of halfway in between both.
R:  Okay.  Okay.  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [MN]
L:  Yeah, it's not a bad --
