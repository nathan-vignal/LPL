L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.  My name is Angela Eason.
R:  Hi.  I'm Rebecca Miller.
L:  Hi, Rebecca.
R:  Hi. [MN] So, we have to talk about bioterrorism.
L:  I think they're going to prompt us again.  I'm not really sure.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I'm hoping.  [MN]
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Because I feel like if I knew how to prevent the attacks that I -- I wouldn't be where I am right now.  I'd be somewhere preventing the attacks. [MN]
L:  Absolutely, absolutely. [MN]
R:  [MN]
L:  I think they're not talking about what we would do to prevent it but maybe what the government --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- could do to prevent it.  I -- I'm guessing.
R:  Oh, okay.  Um ...
L:  Which again, I'm not sure. [MN]
R:  Yeah, it's kind of a [MN] hard issue, isn't it?
L:  Yes, I -- I don't think there's much that can be done --
R:  No.
L:  -- to prevent them.
R:  [MN] I -- I kind of think that, um, that it's important that -- that something that never happened, actually the Trade Center attacks, is that the United States starts to look at, like, its role in the world and why everyone is so angry.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  'Cause, ah, I just think that was totally neglected. [LIPSMACK]  So ... yeah.  I mean that's the only thing that can sort of prevent anything happening. [MN]
L:  I'm with you.  I -- I just don't even know where -- where to even go with that so --
R:  Yeah.  [MN]
L:  -- I guess we should maybe, all right, let's just see if after thirty seconds they give us a prompt or something.  
R:  Oh, okay.  [PAUSE]
L:  Nope.  [MN]
R:  [MN] left to sink or swim.  It's no fair.
L:  I -- yeah, that's a tough one.  I was expecting more like, um, hm, not what the government can do, not political. [MN]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um --
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  [LIPSMACK] okay. [MN]
L:  [MN]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, ah, you know the -- the vaccination thing is not a bad idea.  I don't think it' prevent an attack but maybe prevent injury, you know.  
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  I think you're right.  Um, it's a weird issue too because, um, some of the vaccinations have side effects, I guess --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, too, like, if people have allergies, so, then they have to decide whether it's worth risking the people who could -- could die from their vaccinations.
L:  Right.
R:  Huh.  But it's probably, I mean, a good thing to, like, be prepared and have stuff stored up.  
L:  Sure.  The [MN] -- for me, originally, you know, w- -- back when the original thing happened, [MN] you know, I was, um, probably a whole lot more paranoid, I guess, than now --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know of something like that happening.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Even though the risk is probably greater now that we're not prepared.  [MN]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, because, ah, I think that part of their, um, s- -- the terrorism strategy is for not to be -- for you not to be prepared [MN] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and every time, like, we have a Veterans' Day or something they raise the alert but really those days are gonna be less likely [MN] --
R:  Yeah, I think that's true.
L:  -- for me.  I laugh every time I see that.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, because the whole idea is to make you panic --
L:  Right --
R:  -- if you had no idea it was coming.
L:  -- the whole idea is to take you off guard.  [MN]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ... and -- and I think it will happen.  I -- I really do.
R:  Yeah, me too.  It's -- it's pretty nerve wracking.  I'm moving to New York City in a few weeks --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- um, so -- and -- so, and it's actually like something that I thought about but I figure you really can't stop living your life --
L:  No.
R:  -- the way you would live it because it creates, ah --
L:  Not at all and everyone would love to live in New York City.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [MN]
L:  [LAUGH] So, regardless.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, you know, to me, ah, we have less risk with something like that than say being in Korea and having to walk around with a mask on, you know, [MN] --
R:  Yeah, seriously.
L:  So --
R:  But --
L:  -- which may be some kind of virus, bioterrorism anyway.
R:  Yeah.  Is that what they're saying?  I haven't --
L:  No they're not.
R:  I haven't heard [several inaudible words].
L:  They're not saying --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just my weird way of thinking.
R:  Well, you can never know about these things.  Um, [LIPSMACK], yeah, it's really scary.  Hm ... [MN].
L:  Well, I don't --
R:  I don't know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Ah [MN]
R:  It's kind of a big issue.
L:  [MN] Yes.
R:  Um, hm, [LAUGH].
L:  How many days are you signed up for? [MN]
R:  Um, I'm signed up for a lot of days right now.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  Have you done this one, ah, this thing before?
L:  No, this is the first time.
R:  Oh, okay.  I wonder if it's all, like, big issues.
L:  Right.  Is this your first one too?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] So ...
L:  And I think we can do three.
R:  Oh, okay --
L:  -- and -- but I signed up for every day.
R:  Oh, okay.  [MN] Yeah, it seems like a good way to make extra money.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.
R:  Um ...
L:  Where'd you find out about it?
R:  Um, I found out on line actually.
L:  On where?
R:  Um, there's a website called Craig's List ...
L:  Okay.
R:  -- dotcom and --
L:  'Cause I just -- I run a website and I just put it out on the -- on the web --
R:  Oh, yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with your referral number?  That's a good idea.
L:  No, no, I didn't do it with the referral number.  I just put it out.  I -- I run a website and [MN] I put it out, um, y- -- day before yesterday actually and --
R:  Oh, o- --
L:  I was j- -- I was just wondering how many people ran it after me.  [MN]
R:  Well, you know you can, um, you can make money from people --
L:  Yeah, they want men signed up right now.
R:  Oh.
L:  You know, and they're paying, like, [MN] I think a dollar for every ten men -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- something like that. [MN] But, um, tell me your -- the website you found it on.
R:  It's called Craig's List.
L:  Is it W.W.W. Craig's List dotcom?
R:  Dot org.
L:  Dot org.  Okay.
R:  Yeah, and I think this was the Boston Craig's List.  They're -- they're just -- um, they're for lots of different cities and there are job websites, there are housing websites, there's just like --
L:  Oh, well, check out the -- check out mine 'cause I've got --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- like, a whole list of surveys and stuff you can do. [MN]
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, so it's W.W.W. --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- Freelance --
R:  Freelance?
L:  Yeah.  B.Y.U. dotcom.
R:  Freelance B.Y.U.
L:  Dotcom.
R:  Okay, great.
L:  Yeah. [MN] So --
R:  Thank you so much.
L:  I was just wondering when did -- when did it come out on Craig's List?
R:  Um, I don't know, I saw it, ah, like, yesterday.
L:  Yeah, see, a lot of websites, webmasters and stuff, you know, pick up the things I put out and put it on theirs and I was just, like, oh, okay, I'm gonna see, for -- you know, whoever I talk to where they found out about it.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So ... yeah, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I will check out Craig's List data work[?].
R:  Yeah, it's a good -- it's a good site. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Well, great, I would love to [MN] --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- read about some of these surveys and stuff.
L:  Right.  Well, there's a whole -- there's a whole page of those, a whole page of mystery shopping, different things like that.
R:  Oh, great.
L:  [COUGH] Yeah.  It's all free, so ...
R:  Yeah, I'm desperate for work right now.
L:  There you go.
R:  [MN]
L:  [MN]
R:  Okay, so ...
L:  They're supposed to tell us when ten minutes is up.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, can you hold on a second while I -- I'm gonna put my friend on for just a second?
R:  Sure.
L:  Just to -- no, I'm not.  I'm gonna stay right here.  She's got her baby, so ... [LIPSMACK], all right, well, I was gonna --
R:  [MN] [several inaudible words] 
L:  Yeah.  I don't -- I don't know what else to do.
R:  Yeah.  Where are you?
L:  In Virginia.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Where are you?
R:  Um, I'm in Providence, Rhode Island, right now.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.  So ... yeah [LAUGH].
L:  [MN]
R:  This is the strangest thing I think I've ever d- ...
L:  I thought, "Yeah, I can talk on any subject".  I- I'm just, I can't believe [LAUGH] --
R:  I know, bioterrorism.
L:  -- they picked this.  Okay.
R:  It's crazy.  My brother is a biochemist and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- like, the government, like, hires a lot of them.  He doesn't work for them.  It's -- it's not his thing but then there's also the, like, potential that he'll be looking for cures for things.  It's r- --
L:  Right, that's good.
R:  -- really weird.  
L:  That's good to --
R:  Yeah.  It's a weird field, but I think there are a lot of people going into it.
L:  Is he, like, immunized and everything?
R:  Um, I don't think he is.  Oh, you mean 'cause the government --
L:  Right.
R:  -- immunized?  Yeah, I don't think so.
L:  No.
R:  He's not one of those -- those cupboard people.
L:  Hm.  
R:  But, um, yeah.
L:  It's a shame.
R:  There's, like, a lot of -- I think, I think if something happened we'd be able to figure something out really quickly because --
L:  Oh, I know we -- yeah. [MN]
R:  There's such a huge scientific community that might be doing other things right now.
L:  Ah, yeah, I think -- I think they're protecting themselves [MN] first --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  And, of course, it's like capitalism so somebody could probably make money from a cure afterwards --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- so those people will be working on that too. [MN] So, yeah. [MN] everything will be fine, right [inaudible]?
L:  Yes. [MN]
R:  [MN] I actually had a friend who got a job.  He was a college student last summer and, um, it was, like, the New York City -- it was, um, it was -- it was, like, I don't know if they were working with the F- FBI but they got a bunch of college students to, like, [MN] brainstorm ways that the city could be attacked and to find ways --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- yeah and then to, like, find a way to fight it.  And they wanted kids who were, like, unassociated with law enforcement, just, like, people who thought in creative ways.
L:  I love that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's a great idea.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That --
R:  So, it's nice to know they're, like, taking sort of unusual w- ways of finding ways to solve problems.
L:  Yeah, that -- that's a great idea, proactive for a change.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  So ... [MN]
L:  Th- --
R:  That's the way it's going on.  It was weird though.  She could- -- she couldn't really talk about what she was doing at work --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- specifically, it was, like, very top secret.
L:  Yeah.  That's great though.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And did -- how -- did they pay 'em well?
R:  Yeah, they paid them really well.
L:  Great.
R:  Yeah, so that's an exciting thing is the college kids, like, save the world.
L:  Yeah, and they will.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's great.
R:  Um, yeah.  And it hasn't been ten minutes yet? [MN]
L:  No, it has not. [MN]
R:  Um ...
L:  It hasn't -- I -- I didn't look at the clock when the phone rang so --
R:  Yeah, me either.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [MN]
L:  I need to be on ten.  Okay.  She said at least five.
R:  Oh, really? 
L:  Yeah.
