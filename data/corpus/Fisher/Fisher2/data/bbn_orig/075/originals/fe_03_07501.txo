L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, uh, my name is Muzo[?].  I'm from -- actually from Seattle.
R:  Mm.  My name's Kathy, I'm from Waverley, Ohio.
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh, uh, phew, actually I don't know, uh, enough about the topic because [NOISE] um, since I lived, uh, ten -- ten years of my, uh, life, the twelve first years of my life in Germany but, uh, later in Turkey and now I'm in the States for the last, um, three years and, um, uh, I have seen, uh, for -- for sure a lot of holiday time but, um, I mean I have only been here for two years.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Uh, I -- I think that Christmas is, uh, a beautiful time for people to, uh, share moments and I guess you would, uh, know much more [LAUGH] about the topic.
R:  Yeah, I think Christmas is my favorite holiday.  Well, you probably have some in Germany, don't you, different holidays?  What do you have that would compare to Christmas, anything?
L:  Yeah -- yeah, they do, they have Christmas and, uh -- but I was a little kid then and, uh, I -- I went to elementary school and later, um, I went to Turkey where they -- where they don't, you -- uh, have Christmas, but, uh --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- actually Santa Claus is from Turkey, I mean.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  He -- he lived in the, um -- in that part of the world, uh, so, uh a lot of Christian people come to, um -- to visit his, uh, grave, uh, at Christmas time.
R:  Mm.
L:  Uh, but [COUGH] it is not, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- celebrated nationally.  The people don't -- don't, uh, uh -- Christian people in Turk- --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Living in Turkey celebrate it but, um, there are not a lot of Christian people so, uh, it is not a tradition that I, uh, saw living for a very long time, um --
R:  Mm, well what other kind of holidays do you have, then?  What do you celebrate?
L:  [NOISE] Uh, they have, uh, different, uh, religious holidays in, uh, Turkey like, um, they have, uh, one for the, I think, uh, birth of, uh, Mohammed and then they have, uh -- and others, uh, but I -- I -- I don't -- I -- I don't, uh, celebrate them, uh, very much too because, uh, for a while I -- I watched everything but after that everything is so much a lot of obligation that, uh, you must have to do this to do that so, um [COUGH] --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I actually didn't, uh, support it a lot later.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And, uh -- but, uh, I am willing to, uh, learn more about, uh, Christmas here --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- by living here and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- participate.
R:  Mhm.  I like it because, uh, the people come -- I have, uh, five brothers and four sisters so -- and they all live scattered all round so it makes it nice holidays, everyone tries to get together.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  So do you come from a big family like that?
L:  Uh, we have -- we have three brothers --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and I'm the big -- uh, oldest one actually and, um -- and none -- none of us have children yet but, uh, the uncles and, uh, aunts they come together in, uh -- in Turkish, um, holiday season, too.  Um --
R:  Are any of them here or are they still in Turkey?
L:  No, they are back in Turkey.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, actually, um, it is, uh, more difficult for me to participate in any of them and [COUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I like it, uh, watching here and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- also, um, some of the Turkish people living in the States come together on --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- special days and, uh, we know that then the Turk people in Turkey do the same thing -- same things there --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it is like feeling in back in Turkey and it's like feeling back home, that's good.
R:  Well, did you speak English back in Turkey or did you just learn it after you got here?
L:  Um, I -- I learned it in Turkey.  I learned --
R:  Mm.
L:  Uh, [NOISE] it's -- it's quite not very good but, um, uh, since I know German I -- it was, uh, easier for me to, uh, adapt to English.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, and I -- I -- it has a little bit improved, uh, while I'm here.
R:  Well, I think your accent is nice.  I like it. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It's -- it's like a German accent more because --
R:  Yeah, no, I can only speak English but my sister --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- speaks, like, ten languages.  She, um --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- wrote a book about Mother Teresa and someone is translating it.  It's in French now, I think, but, you know, it's just in English now.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, that's what, I mean, she can speak all these languages --
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  -- but I can't.  She's traveled all around --
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  -- but I haven't been many places myself.
L:  [NOISE] Where -- where have you ever been?
R:  Now -- now she was in Seattle not very long ago promoting her book --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- at, um -- couple of months ago she was there for a month so she gets around all over but well I -- I've only been a few places in the United States --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I went to, uh, Mexico once --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and the Bahamas --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- on cruises and that's it for me. [LAUGH]
L:  And -- and -- [NOISE]
R:  Have you traveled a lot?
L:  [NOISE] Yes.
R:  Mm.
L:  Uh, do you do that in holiday times, too? [NOISE]
R:  No. [COUGH]
L:  No?
R:  I usually --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I'm the one that stays here --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and the rest of the family comes here because my mother still lives here.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So they all come here to see her.
L:  Oh [NOISE] and, uh, they come, uh, every Christmas, every holiday time?
R:  Yeah, 'cause I still -- I still live in our hometown.
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  So I think there's three of us that live here now and the rest of them --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- are scattered so then they come back here.  So that's what's nice about I'm being here, I don't have to leave [LAUGH] and they come to me.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah. [COUGH]
L:  I see.  Um --
R:  But she liked Seattle --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- when she was there visiting.  My daughter went there to a wedding recently --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so ...
L:  Yeah, uh, uh, Seattle is a nice place.  It's really beautiful and, um, people are good and, uh, the nature is wonderful, there's so much green and blue and --
R:  It's a pretty big city, isn't it?
L:  [SIGH] It is big, yeah, it is.
R:  'Cause I -- 'cause I just live in a real small town, just --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Just less than five thousand people here.
L:  Oh.
R:  So it's just a little, tiny town. [LAUGH]
L:  Actually the place where I live is Kirkland, it is, like, ten minutes to Seattle and, uh --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it is, like, uh, thirty five thousand people but --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it --
R:  Well, that sounds big to me [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- from where I'm from.
L:  [LAUGH] Um --
R:  Now, did you live in a big city in Turkey?
L:  Yeah, I lived in Istanbul, that was, uh, twelve -- uh, twelve million, uh, people.
R:  Oh wow, oh wow.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Big, wow.
L:  It is --
R:  That sounds overwhelming to me.
L:  [LAUGH] Yes, it is the, uh, biggest city in Turkey and one of the --
R:  Wow.
L:  [NOISE] -- biggest in the world and, um [NOISE] uh, it is actually, um -- I'm used to live in a big city --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so, uh [NOISE] Seattle isn't so much big for me --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because, uh [NOISE] this was, uh -- and in -- in Germany it was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, two million people city again --
R:  Yeah, oh.
L:  -- in Hamburg so --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- uh --
R:  I think it would be hard for me to go to another country like that since I don't speak the language [LAUGH] so ...
L:  Yeah, it [LAUGH] -- but usually people -- everywhere you can find someone who speaks English and --
R:  Yeah, well, might have to go with my sister, now she can speak -- well, I don't think she speaks German but she has been there and, yeah, she can get --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Since with her different languages, she can talk to people.
L:  Oh.
R:  She always [LAUGH] finds a way.
L:  Yes, that's true.
R:  But, I can't --
L:  Is -- is she a kind of journalist or ...?
R:  Yeah, uh-huh.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Well, she started out, you know, writing in college and she's done that ever -- she's written about, oh, maybe eight books but her Mother Teresa one is the bestseller that she's had so far.
L:  Wow.
R:  [SIGH] So ...
L:  That -- that's wonderful, uh --
R:  And what kind of work do you do?
L:  Um, I -- I work in, uh -- in a foreign trade company.  We, uh, export import and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- uh, our [SIGH] business is related with Turkey and, um, with, um, um -- with Germany, too.
R:  Mhm.  What made you decide to come to the United States and leave Turkey or Germany?
L:  Uh, I -- I like to, uh, change places so I didn't, um -- I -- I leave Germany --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when I was, uh, very small, that was the decision of my family but --
R:  Mhm. [COUGH]
L:  -- later coming here that was -- was my decision since I was used to live abroad, uh, and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- uh, knew a little bit about the, uh, Western culture.  It's, um [SIGH] -- uh, I somewhat believe that there's a better life here and there -- it's more peaceful to be in, uh, uh -- in the States than in a so crowded and, uh, overwhelming city.
R:  Now --
L:  I just --
R:  -- do you think you'll stay in Seattle for a while longer or are you going to be moving on again?
L:  Excuse me?
R:  I said do you think you're going to stay there in Seattle or do you plan --
L:  Yes, yes.
R:  -- to move again in the future?
L:  For -- for -- for a while.  I -- I -- I, uh -- since, uh, my, uh, business, uh, [NOISE] allows me to live here, and um, I -- I liked it here --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I -- I think I will live here for a while and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, later maybe go back or -- the -- the, uh -- the ultimate goal is to be there and -- and here at -- I mean, for a couple of months --
R: Yeah.
L:  -- in the summer for a couple of months in Seattle.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, I'd like to come there to visit sometime.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It seems to be --
L:  Yeah.
R:  What's the weather there like now?
L:  You -- you should do. [LAUGH] You -- you should do.  It's -- it's really very beautiful here and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's -- it's a good experience to see it, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, and actually I believe that [NOISE] all of the United States, [NOISE] every place has its single, uh, characteristic beauty so, uh, it would be nice if, uh, I one day could travel all over the States.
R:  Yeah.  You haven't been to Ohio yet, have you?
L:  No, not yet.
R:  No.
L:  Uh, I've been to New Orleans, to New York --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- but -- and LA but --
R:  I've been to those two places but [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [COUGH] -- that's it.  I think I've been to -- Nebraska the farthest I've been west.
L:  Nebraska, uh-huh.
R:  So I haven't really been very far. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Um --
R:  [COUGH] [MN]
L:  Yeah, that -- that's -- and -- and I traveled also in Europe and saw a lot --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- of tradition and history and that was nice, too.
R:  Yes --
L:  Um --
R:  -- it would be interesting.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah and --
R:  Did you go to college?
L:  [SIGH]
