R:  Hi.
L:  Hello.
R:  My name is --
L:  Go ahead.
R:  This is Nancy in California.
L:  Hi.  My name is Christina Vigg in Washington.
R:  Hi, Christina.
L:  Hi, Nancy.  Nice to meet ya.  
R:  Would you like to go first?
L:  You know [LAUGH] that's a big question.
R:  Yes, it is.  
L:  I don't know if I want to go first.  Do you have thoughts on this already?
R:  [SIGH].  Okay.  Uh, I think that um we're over there, that we should be cleaning out the place.  I think that we should be um restoring order to the country --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- any way that we can.  I think that we should act like we have been through a war and we are the victors and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think that anybody that opposes our -- our presence there should be arrested.
L:  Mhm.  So --
R:  I --
L:  -- you think we're being too nice?
R:  Yes.  Definitely.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Like, thank you.  That was a good summary.  [LAUGH].  
L:  That's what I heard, and -- and -- and I have to agree with you.  We've typically always been the nice guys, you know?  We go over, we win and then we're -- I mean, it started in Japan and it's -- we just haven't changed our ways [LAUGH] at all.   
R:   That's true.  I agree with that.  
L:   But and then you've got the long run to look at and -- and can we ever get to a point where we -- you know, they're cultures would be compatible with our culture?  And --
R:   I don't think that's going to happen.
L:   Um mm.
R:   Um --
L:   That's -- that's the biggest problem is -- is they're -- they have a mandate, a core mandate in their culture and it's aimed at Americans and I don't know if we [SIGH] put them in a box or you know, how do you deal with somebody that's just not gonna change their mind?
R:   Well, they have indoctrinated their young for so long --
L:   Yeah.
R:   -- with hatred of Americans, uh, that's a place that we can start.  Um --
L:   Maybe retraining them a bit.
R:   Sure.  Start -- start with the kids. 
L:   Yeah.
R:   Um, hope -- hopefully we're not gonna be over there for a hundred years and --
L:   Oh, I would hope not.
R:   -- whatever the plan was with the politicians, when -- when they started this um --
L:   I think the goal was safety and -- and that's -- needs to maintain -- we need to maintain that goal because they impinged on our -- our territory.  They impinged on our way of life.  Um --
R:   And -- yeah, and then maybe we should narrow our sights and say let's make sure that our --
L:   That it --
R:   -- country is safe --
L:   Safe, yeah.  Work on our borders --
R:   -- from these people.
L:   -- a bit and -- and uh -- but bioterrorism, that's -- that's a tough one to control because it's such a new technology.  I think we need to um be involved in the research of the technology and be the leaders in -- in how you know, the weapons against biotechnology.  I think that's an area that we should focus in how to protect ourselves, um --
R:   Yeah.
L:   -- research wise, how to make it harder to use biotechno- you know, those kinds of weapons against our people.  Right now, those weapons aren't very effective anyway.  Um, the germ warfare and stuff, the stuff I've read on it, most of what's going to happen happens in the first five to ten seconds and if you're in the open air, you know, it's only in concentrated closed areas that that kind of -- those kind of weapons are of any effect at all at this point.
R:   Mhm.
L:   And so I don't know that they're as big a threat, but it could become a big threat if the research is allowed to continue and we're not on top of our game and staying on top of the research and knowing what's going on.
R:   Yeah.  Yeah.  That's true.
L:   So.
R:   And in the past, we -- we developed the atomic weapons so that we could protect ourselves.
L:   Yeah.
R:   And we did protect ourselves.
L:   Yeah, and -- and we have to keep it at a protection level, but in an aggressive manner.  I mean, and I think the world's pretty well aware of the fact that we aren't gonna let anybody push us around.  But I like the idea of being -- I don't know, we're so independent and we -- we so much just want to do it our own way and to heck with the rest of the world sometime, and yet we're always out there giving all the funding, you know, to third world countries when they have famines and even restoring them after a war.  I mean, the moneys that we poured into places like Japan and Korea and Vietnam after wars is just amazing, for being a nation that conquered them.  They sure benefit when we [LAUGH] conquer them.  [LAUGH].
R:   Yeah.  
L:   [LAUGH].
R:   Yeah.  
L:   And so you know, we ought to use that to our advantage and -- and just really, really get as much information on how far has their technology gone, how far has their research gone, what exactly can they do, and make it our own.  You know?
R:   And I think that we have to look at these countries that are supplying them with raw materials.
L:   Oh, yeah.
R:   Uh, this --
L:   They've got to know --
R:   This nice guy --
L:   -- that --
R:   This nice guy stance that we have isn't working.
L:   I'm still mad at France.  You know?  [LAUGH].
R:   Yeah.  Yeah.
L:   And -- and other countries that, you know -- you know, they just don't have a clue of what's at stake, I don't think.  Um --
R:   Either that or they're so damn money hungry that they don't care.
L:   That could be, but it's gonna bit them --
R:   Sure it is.
L:   I just -- I just can't imagine, you know -- and we have to bite 'em.  I think we've got to, you know, the -- we have the power and enough consumer power that we -- we can do boycotts, we can do things that would impact them and -- and sway their -- you know, their policy making.  And I think --
R:   Yeah, mainly by --
L:   -- we gotta use that power.
R:   -- with -- by withholding dollars.
L:   Oh, yeah.  You know, there's so much funding that we do to so many different countries, and if they're gonna supply the countries that are attacking us, we pull the funding.  I mean, I don't even think we bat an eye on that one.  If you're -- if you're helping out people that are -- are attacking our -- our country, then you're not -- you know, we don't have any support for you.  I think that's gotta be real clear, especially terrorism, because terrorism is such a -- a cowardly way to fight anyway.  I mean, if you have --
R:   Right.  
L:   -- issues, come to the table, let's work these issues out, but to do it with terrorist attacks, that's lower than -- than a snake, you know, that crawls through the dust.  And I don't think we should even -- you know, we shouldn't tolerate it.
R:   [MN].
L:   So I think funding to research and -- and you know, keeping our knowledge base up and then pulling funding for those countries that are giving technology to these countries that are gonna use it to you know fight wars, for terrorist attacks --
R:   Mhm.  Yeah.  And there is another issue that come up, too.  And that's some of the um South American countries --
L:   Mm.
R:   -- with the benefit of the United States, are now issuing ID cards to their people who are in the United States without proper documentation.
L:   Really?
R:   And the United States is accepting this.
L:   Huh.
R:   Which seems insane to me. 
L:   Yeah.
R:   Because the only people here without documentation are people that shouldn't be here. 
L:   Illegal aliens.  I -- I definitely think our borders need to be tightened up.  We are way, way too liberal and way, way too loose and we need to start cleaning things up.  You know --
R:   Yeah.
L:   -- if you're not a US citizen and you're not here on a visa, you're not here.  I mean, California actually pays for medical aid for these illegal aliens.  That's our tax dollars giving them medicine and -- and you know, they're making it too nice for them to stay.  [LAUGH].
R:   Well, yeah.  And plus the fact that people here without documentation are here illegally.
L:   Yeah.
R:   And if there is a terrorist in the batch, they're gonna --
L:   It's one of them.
R:   -- get these ID cards --
L:   Oh, yeah.
R:   -- from these countries also.
L:   Yep.  
R:   So --
L:   They'll use it to their advantage and it'll get them, you know, access to areas that we don't want them to have access to.
R:   Right.  
L:   So --
R:   So there might be a lot of good people who are here without documentation and -- and I regret it for those people, but if we have terrorists in our midst, we gotta do something about it.
L:   Yeah.  And it's a shame, but for our own protection, if they're here without documentation, they shouldn't be here, no matter how good they are.
R:   Yeah, yeah.
L:   They have broke --
R:   Yeah, that's true.
L:   -- the law and there's consequences when you break the law.  If we were to go to their country and break the law, they wouldn't bat an eye about throwing us in a prison and not even, you know, giving us any --
