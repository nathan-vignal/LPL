R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, I'm June.  How are you?
L:  I'm Ben.  I'm fine.
R:  Okay, we're supposed to talk about sports.
L:  Okay.  Well, I love sports.  I'm watching sports right now.  [LAUGH] 
R:  What are you watching?
L:  I'm watching the Braves.
R:  How often do you watch, uh, sports?
L:  Um, for -- that's pretty much the only thing I really like watching.  I'd much rather watch college football but football's not on right now.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  Do you ev- do you ever watch any of the, uh, playoffs?
L:  Oh, the -- yeah.  [MN] Yeah.  I don't like basketball that much.  I'll watch the playoffs every now and again.
R:  Mhm.
L:  For base- -- for basketball because, you know, just got to keep up with it.
R:  [NOISE] You only watch, um, baseball though m- -- mainly?
L:  No.  I -- I mainly watch football.  I d- -- I like the Braves though.  I don't really like watching baseball 'cause it's kind of boring to watch.  But here lately, the Braves have just been hitting so good that it's kinda exciting.
R:  [LAUGH] Uh, I happen to like other sports, not particularly baseball, unless the series is on.  Then I do like to watch it.
L:  Well, what kind of sports do you like?
R:  I like the tennis and the h- -- and the golf.
L:  Well, I -- I like Anna Kournikova but y- [LAUGH] --
R:  Well, yeah, she's something on the court.  Um, but my friend happens to be a tennis umpire --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- and, um, yeah.  So, he goes to all these different tournaments and so, I always watch them to see if I catch -- to see him on, uh, umpiring.  And then of course I'm not watching the show.
L:  Mm.
R:  Uh, but I like -- I like, um, in fact he's going to be doing the open in New York, which will be on television, you know, it's going to be--
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- all over in fact, um --
L:  I've always liked Agassi 'cause he's just cool.
R:  Well, you know, what's good about him is that he's -- he just tries so hard. 
L:  Mm.
R:  And you -- you c- -- you can't help rooting for him, you know, 'cause he really wants to win.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But there's a lot of very good, uh, guys out there.  Uh, I actually go out on Arthur Ash Day to, uh, sh- -- uh, +Arthur at -- Arthur Ash Stadium --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I teach -- they have the kids there and the pros come out and they -- and they show them how to play.  It's really very interesting.  And, uh, you know, you volunteer and you put them -- you help them with the balls and, you know, you don't really do any of the coaching but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they -- they do the coaching.  But it's really very nice and it's good for the kids.  Plus you get tee shirt and meals for it, you know, so, it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- worth it.  It's fun.
L:  I wasn't never good at tennis.  I -- I mean, I used to play every now and again when we were with my cousins.  They live in Minnesota, they like tennis.  They -- they'd come down and I'd play with them.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, um, it's just -- it's too much -- I don't have that much coordination or that much stam- stamina as --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- far as, you know, run- -- quick back --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and forth.
R:  Do you w- -- do you watch anything else besides football?  Um, and, uh, baseball?  Any other sports on TV?
L:  Golf.
R:  Oh, you do like golf?
L:  Yes.  Uh, I like golf.
R:  Oh, how long do you think you watch golf?
L:  Well, I mean, I watched all the op- -- I mean, I watch the USA Open, the Masters --
R:  There's one that just was over recently?  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I saw that.  I don't like -- I do not like, Singh --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- Singh.  I -- I -- I think he's a arrogant prick for saying what he said about, Annika +Sorenstam.
R:  Well, I, you know, everyone's entitled to their, uh, but that -- but yeah, I don't know what --
L:  Yeah, he's en- -- he's entitled to his opinion.  He just shouldn't have said it on national television.
R:  Well, a lot of them shouldn't say it.  Uh, what did you think of, um, who's the guy that just hit three hundred?  Um --
L:  Oh, that was, um, Palmerro[?] --
R:  Um --
L:  -- oh, he didn't hit, he -- he -- he's, um --
R:  -- let me --
L:  -- won three hundred games.
R:  He won three hundred games --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, it went to that -- yeah, I know.  Ever got on the stadium when you watch these guys do this?  I used to when I was younger; I don't any more be- --
L:  I've been -- I -- I went into a Fulton County -- uh, well, are you from Georgia?  Or ...
R:  No, I'm not.  I'm from New York.
L:  Okay.  Well, oh yeah, I -- I co- -- I could kinda tell but, ah, I'm not absolutely sure, you know.  But, um, yeah, I used to go to the old stadium, Fulton County stadium before --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the Olympics came to Atlanta and they built a new stadium.
R:  Oh, right!
L:  But, um, I haven't really been -- I haven't seen the Braves in a long time live.
R:  Mhm.  Who o- --
L:  I go to --
R:  -- who owns the Braves anyway?  Isn't it some guy that -- some [PAUSE] well, um, is that, Chet Turner[?], that owns one of these teams down, uh, in the south?  He used to own a team or something.
L:  Si- -- [inaudible] 
R:  Didn't cat --
L:  Dave Turner --
R:  -- yeah, didn't he own a team -- came dow- -- a southern team?
L:  Who?
R:  Didn't, Chet Turner, own a southern team?
L:  Yeah, the Braves.
R:  Oh, he does own it.  Oh, well, maybe not any more.
L:  Well, he sold it to Time Warner I think.
R:  Uh-huh.  Well, sa- --
L:  He -- he owned wrestling too.  [MN]
R:  Oh, really?
L:   Yeah.  I watch wrestling but I don't consider that a sport.
R:  Uh, well, they do though.  Don't kid yourself.  Um, I -- I remember, I don't know, might -- you may be a little bit younger but --
L:  Oh, n- -- I -- I --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- rem- -- tell me.  I'll remember.  [LAUGH] 
R: [LAUGH] But I used to have a friend whose grandmother used to watch the wresting.
L:  Mhm.
R:  She loved it.  Look, I think it's so phony but I realized --
L:  Oh, it is.  
R:  -- but I really guess that, you know, I --
L:  It's like a soap opera for guys.
R:  Ah, yes.  [LAUGH] That's a -- well, that's one way to put it.  That's unbelievable, that's very -- that's very good.  I like that one.  But y- -- but it -- I couldn't understand -- I mean, on -- the first time I ever watched -- I ever watched --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- TV and watched sports was roller derby.
L:  Oh, I -- I'm too young for that one.
R:  Well, I watched r- -- and I'm -- I'm not talking about the recent roller derby that came back at -- and the --
L:  Yeah, I -- I'm try- --
R:  -- I'm talking about the sixties.  I watched --
L:  Yeah, I know what you're talking about.
R:  -- I t- -- I watched the real roller der- -- th- the teams with the guys ad the girls out together.  But, you know, they -- they -- they did --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I mean, I had -- those girls were my heroines because in the sixties girls weren't doing things like that, you know, knocking over --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- other girls.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And I thought it was hysterical but I really liked it.  That was a good contact sport.  What do you think of girls playing basketball?
L:  I don't -- I don't really like watching it.  'Cause I can't play basketball, I really don't want to see girls doing something much better than I'll ever be able [LAUGH] to do.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's -- I could play -- I could play pretty much anything but basketball.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I love to play soccer.  I don't like watching it 'cause it's boring.
R:  I think it's very hard. They talk about all these women being soccer moms --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I don't -- I don't -- I don't get soccer at all.  But then again I don't get the other game that, um, [PAUSE]
L:  What, hockey?
R:  -- uh, ho- -- yeah, I don't get hockey either.
L:  Me neither.
R:  I don't, well, and you know, well, maybe because when I was growing up, I didn't grow up in New York, I grew up in New England.  You would think I would b- -- get hockey, you know, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because everybody had hockey sticks and skates.
L:  Yeah.  Not here 
R:  I can't skate 'cause my, um ankle turned on me when I was a kid.
L:  Mm. 
R:  And so if I have to put skates on, I have to have braces on --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- or my ankles will -- well, when I was younger.  Uh, now I wouldn't even attempt to do it.
L:  I --
R:  And [LAUGH] --
L:  I can't skate just because I can't skate.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- Well, I mean, you're weather isn't conducive to having ice, although it gets kind of, oh --
L:  I can't stop.  That's what it is.  I ca- -- I really, like, we have a skating rink around where I live and I used to go skating and run into the wall 'cause I couldn't stop.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] But I -- but I liked roller skating.  And -- and that's why I really enjoyed the rollers -- but it just died.  That whole sport died.  It just never, never picked up again.
L:  No.
R:  I don't know, I -- it's not doing it in -- in -- where you live, right?   They -- they --don't --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- don't do r- -- they still do rollers there?
L:  They have just now I just noticed came back; roller derby.
R:  But they're not televising it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Not by me -- not in New York.
L:  It's, like, late at night.
R:  Well --
L:  W- we watch the Sopranos here.  [LAUGH]  
R:  Oh, well, I love the Sopranos.  But I love the Sopranos, I -- listen they're coming back, uh, not until two thousand and four.  But I -- I -- I even like Sex in the City, that's a really good show.
L:  Yeah, it's ending.
R:  [MN] Excuse me?
L:  This is, like, it's last episode this year.
R:  It's over, yes, but they're going to do twelve episodes and then they're going to -- to stop --
L:  And the Sopranos comes back in September.
R:  Uh, no, is it September?
L:  Yeah, I think.
R:  I -- I thought it was March.  Well --
L:  Well, it might be.  I don't know.
R:  -- Uh, I know, I know, I know I [several inaudible words] like, cable is so expensive, you know, I [MN] -- 
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  I -- well, yeah, I, uh --
L:  We got the monopoly here.  [LAUGH] The only --
R:  [several inaudible words] 
L:  -- cable you can get is cox cable and it's the -- there aint no other way unless you go satellite dish.
R:  Well, when I was in Florida it was broadband, which was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, not bad, you know, but I wo- -- well, it was kinda cheap 'cause it was an introductory offer.
L:  Mhm.
R:  When I went to -- we're supposed to be talking about sports, but --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Great sports.  Okay, so, I often like racing, just because -- just because there's -- there's a hero to -- to root for.  I never --
R:  You --
L:  -- liked it before, um, the [inaudible] 
R:  Do you like the flats?  Or do you like the, um, the p- -- the other ones, the, uh --
L:  Nascar.
R:  No, the ones with there -- [MN] trotters.
L:  The trotters?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I like car racing.
R:  Oh, you mean car racing?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I thought you meant automobile -- I though you meant, um, not automobile racing --
L:  Horse.
R:  -- I thought you meant horses.
L:  Oh, no.  I don't have enough money to like horse racing.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, no, it's a beautiful sport without having to, um, now you see that's a sport I do -- the sport of kings.  But I tell you the truth, I do like horse racing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  'Cause I used to -- my -- [MN] my ex, ex boyfriend used to take me to the races all the time --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- 'cause he was a big gambler.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And --
L:  That's -- that's why I don't like --
R:  No, but we went to the clubhouse, you know, for me it was the clubhouse, it was the -- the dinner, you know, it was, uh, it was all the other stuff.  It's, like, you know, uh, and I enjoyed that, um, and it -- but I -- today I enjoy watching the -- I watched the -- all the -- the [inaudible] and I watched the Belmont. I enjoy those types of sports.  I do, to me it's -- I don't think about the gambling.  I -- I -- I --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- I'm not interested in, you know, wh- --
L:  I'm interested in -- in what -- what's the horse's name that wins 'cause it's always kinda cute.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  That's what I enjoyed.  I -- I -- I liked to see this -- [MN] the -- the horses I -- 'cause I think they're so beautiful.  They -- they're beautiful --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- animals --
