L:  [NOISE] [MN]
R:  Jennifer.
L:  Hi.  Darlene.  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Oh, hello.  [MN] This is the first time I'm doing this, so [MN] --
R:  Me too.  I -- I don't even know what I'm supposed to be doing.
L:  [MN] I guess we're just supposed to chat -- chat about, um, the topic. [MN] Um, which was the t- --
R:  bioterrorism.
L:  Right.  If the US is doing enough about the bioterrorism.
R:  Did you get this through an email or ...?
L:  Ah, through, um, [LIPSMACK] actually, um, I subscribe to a newsletter.
R:  Is it Angie's?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah, me --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- too.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, so, this is my first one.  It's your first one too? [MN]
R:  Mm.  This is the first, um, phone survey. [MN]
L:  Ahah.
R:  Um, I phoned up today and I didn't know much about it, was kind of leery when they asked for my [inaudible] but, you know ...
L:  Well, it's not bad if they're paying, you know, ten dollars a call.
R:  Exactly. [MN]
L:  So, [MN] --
R:  Um ...
L:  -- ten minutes. [MN] So, I guess we gotta talk about terrorism. [MN]
R:  Um, I don't -- I don't really know.  I don't -- I don't think enough's probably ever been done, but how much can you really do? [MN]
L:  Right.
R:  You know.  
L:  Um ...
R:  'Specially, I mean, since nine eleven you never know what's gonna happen now.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  I know, there -- there, um, [LIPSMACK] I live -- I don't know if you live by a big city but I live right outside of Chicago and, um --
R:  Mm, I live in -- I live in North Carolina.
L:  Oh.
R:  Small town in North Carolina.
L:  But they had those, um, mock, um, terrorist attacks.  I don't know if you saw that in the news.  
R:  I did.
L:  Chicago --
R:  Like, training exercises.
L:  Yeah, Chicago was one of 'em and it was -- it was terrible over here with, um, [MN] all the, you know, just the traffic and [MN] --
R:  Right.
L:  [MN]
R:  I don't know if you can ever really be prepared.
L:  [MN] No, it's, yeah, like, es- especially after nine eleven, like you said, because, [NOISE] um, my daughter's on the other phone, can't hear. [LAUGH] Um ...
R:  I know.  I have a three year old, so ...
L:  [LAUGH] It's just, yeah, especially w- -- because they're coming out with, um, you know, as fast as they can find something to -- to fix something they come out with something else.
R:  Right.  Um ...
L:  You know, like, they adapted [inaudible] you know, what were they calling, adaptor germ[?]? [MN]
R:  Right.
L:  You know, I'm sure as soon as they're -- they're -- they're coming out with something to, you know, an immunization or something they're -- somebody else is making some kind of new [MN] bio whatever.
R:  Exactly, and there's no telling how many people living here in the United States work for other people, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- other countries.
L:  That's what they were saying, um, today on the news that, um, there's people being trained in the US.  I don't know if you saw that today, being trained in the US for the, ah, some of that Al -- Al Qaeda -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- whatever.
R:  I wouldn't doubt it.  Um, I don't know.  I think it's hard to secure everything.  Um, it seems like the war isn't even over, over in Iraq either.  As soon as the troops come home they start fighting again.
L:  Oh, I know, someone's getting killed every day [MN], it seems like but, yeah, I think that their bio, you know, whether it's gases or whether it's, you know, like have it in the mail, powders or, you know
R:  Right. 
L:  [MN]
R:  I think it's definitely a -- a threat.
L:  It's hard to, ah --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  Well, pretty soon, who knows?  I mean, pretty soon they might get, ah, you know, [inaudible] something like, remember like that Tylenol thing years ago?
R:  Oh, yeah, the cyanide?
L:  Yeah.  You know, [LIPSMACK] you never know, something like that could happen.  You know --
R:  Exactly, or, I think too it -- it really doesn't have to be foreign.  Wasn't -- wasn't that somebody here --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- that was doing that?
L:  Yeah, little wackos here too. [MN]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We got 'em all over. [LAUGH] You --
R:  I know.
L:  -- don't have to go far to find 'em. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I think here, um -- I live right outside of Winston Salem but Greensboro is one of the bigger cities here --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- um, they had arrested someone at the local airport that was a suspect in some terrorist organization, um, [LIPSMACK] so you never know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what's gonna happen.
L:  No, you don't, and it's hard to -- 'cause I know after, like, nine eleven everybody kind of freaked out and, "What are we gonna do and what's this and what ...", but it's hard, I mean, you kind of have to go on because if you don't ...
R:  Well, I think there needs to be a better screening process.  I mean, I -- I believe that everybody has the same opportunities but there should be some type of screening process when you come into the country --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, and I don't -- I think that's been a little ineffective, um, for all of those terrorists to be c- -- able to come in here and go to school here, um, and, just, they just go undetected, I mean.
L:  Right.  Yeah, they should have some kind of [LIPSMACK], which I know is probably hard, especially coming from those countries that are smaller --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or not, like, as effective as [MN] we are with, like, you kn- -- they should do some kind of background checks or, you know, something.
R:  Well, I was under the impression, um, that when you came into the country on a -- on a visa, 'cause I -- I go to, um, the local university here, you know, if you come on a student visa that that's only temporary and if you apply for citizenship I thought you had to take a class or -- or something --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, but I think because when foreign people come in and they give money to the economy they don't repeatedly check back and see where these students are or --
L:  Oh, yeah, that could be too.
R:  Um ...
L:  To see if they're still in school, you mean?
R:  Right.
L:  Right.
R:  'Cause, you know, if terrorists can come over here and get into school on a student visa and then, you know, continuously have it extended especially if they're at a four year university, that's four years that --
L:  Yeah, yeah, maybe they should do some better screening, ah, with, um, schooling.  Y- -- [MN] those student visas, like you were saying.
R:  I don't know.  I -- I don't really think I've ever seen so much people protesting about the war and things like that but, you know, nobody wants to be attacked either.  It's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's not like war is a great thing and the gov- -- I don't really think the government wanted to do it.  I think you -- they had to do something.
L:  Right.
R:  Ah --
L:  But I must say though that I did, um, had ordered something on eBay and it was coming from Egypt --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] and, um, I have a post office box and it was going to the Post Office and I got in there and I opened it up and it was already opened.  So, they did already -- they must have, you know, screened it or checked it to see what was inside of it.
R:  Right.
L:  So, that was good. [MN]
R:  And I think they're pretty, you know, good at the -- at the airports and stuff.  Um, [MN] I think it was a couple of weeks ago some lady had gotten on a flight, I don't know if it was in Charlotte or ... and had wrote a threatening let- -- a note and gave it to the flight attendant.
L:  Mm.
R:  Um ...
L:  That's no good.
R:  But it must have not been anything.  It, you know, didn't make national headlines or anything.
L:  Hm.  Yeah, it's just, everybody should just get along and, you know, believe in whatever God they believe in and ... because whatever God they believe in they wouldn't constitute killing other people like that, so, you know.
R:  Right.  I don't even know if they even got Saddam Hussein and they haven't found the other guy and I don't know if they ever will.
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  When you have that much money and ...
L:  [MN] Yeah.  [MN] You get, ah, plastic surgery really well and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- [MN] disappear.
R:  Well, my mo- -- my mother had told me that he had had plenty of people that looked like him pose as him and ...
L:  Right.
R:  -- so, his --
L:  He had all those decoys that he would use, like, if he was [NOISE] -- like, for public things, I guess.
R:  Mhm.
L:  For public speeches and -- but I guess they can, [MN] from a distance it's hard but I guess up close they could probably tell.
R:  Right.  Yeah --
L:  But they don't even say anything about if they found any of them. [LAUGH] All his decoys. [MN]
R:  And I think too the public have become frustrated because, well, the media has taken over everything --
L:  Oh, I know, it's terrible.
R:  -- and it, I mean, it's ab- -- I don't know, it -- it bothers me.  I'm -- I'm in school to be a criminal profiler, a psychologist --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and you -- it really, y- -- there is no justice or anything because the media's gonna get it first --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, you know, I don't -- that bothers me that the media's always putting everything out there first and y- you don't know if it's the truth or not, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, and I know people const- --
