R:  I'm Jessica Mizaraka[?].
L:  Hi Jessica.  My name is, ah, Eric Dorfin[?].  How ya doing? [PAUSE] Um, [LIPSMACK] okay, so the topic is what can the United States do to prevent bioterrorism? [PAUSE] 
R:  Um, okay. [LAUGH] 
L: Is -- is that what you heard?
R:  Yeah.  Um --
L:  Okay.  Great. [NOISE]
R:  Okay.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I would think, um, if there's, sort of, ah, biochemical detection equipment at -- in airports and, um, other ports of entry.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, [SIGH] I guess scanning the mail too.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Right.  Right.  That's good.
R:  Mail scanning systems.  Um ... [LIPSMACK]
L:  Th- those are things, I think, that are being done, right?
R:  I don't know.
L:  Okay.
R:  To be p- -- to be honest, I'm not quite sure if they are.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, I would be surprised if all the mail that enters the country is scanned, as a matter of fact.  And if there is a way to, um -- to scan, you know, people coming in the country, I don't think I've seen it unless it's some, kind of, you know, hidden -- 'cause I go in and out of the country all the time.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yep.  Constantly.  Yeah.
L:  Mm.
R:  Um, and I usually just breeze on through. [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.
R:  You know, the occasional, um, take off your shoes but --
L:  Yeah.  Right.
R:  Ah, and I c- --
L:  You don't think that enough is really being done?
R:  Well, you know, I don't know, honestly, um, how much technology we have.  It's possible we don't have the technology.  I also carry on my luggage a lot.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Generally.  'Cause I'm in -- usually in a big hurry.  So, that's another thing is, um -- I have never been asked so far to have my luggage scanned.
L:  Huh.
R:  Ah, except through an x-ray machine.
L:  Yeah.  Right.
R:  [LIPSMACK] So --
L:  Wow.  No, I didn't realize that I haven't traveled, ah, overseas be- -- since, you know -- before nine eleven.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, I mean I've done some domestic travel.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, I didn't, you know -- I just assumed that they did a little more than what you're describing when you came from overseas.  You know?  'Cause I guess they wouldn't know right off the bat whether you're an American citizen or not anyway.  And I guess that wouldn't really matter a whole lot anyhow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  I mean, because, as you know, there are moles in our country. [LAUGH]
L:  Sure.  Sure.
R:  So, I mean, I think that even if I were a citizen or not --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it would be an issue.
L:  Yeah.  Well, that's interesting that you raise those points 'cause, actually, I thought to myself, when I heard the topic, I thought, "Well, you know,  I don't know that really any more can be done than what's being done".  'Cause I al- -- I made some assumptions that, you know, they were doing at least that much.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] You know, because there's not -- beyond that, I mean, if somebody's really got some, kind of, foolproof plan, I mean there's all kinds of -- I mean, it's a huge country and so many ports of entry and so many different ways to commit something like bioterrorism.
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.
L:  That you really --
R:  And ports of entry that are illegal. [LAUGH] You know?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Like coming through Texas and t- -- through Mexico to Texas.
L:  Right.
R:  Which, as we know, happens every day.
L:  Yeah.  Right.  Right.
R:  So, um, you know, in lieu of, um, if there are in fact, ah, types of equipments that detect that, unless you, sort of, had them [LAUGH] everywhere, there's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- always gonna be the threat and it may be -- it may be, um, impossible to -- to have a perfect system.  So, was the actual topic -- it was how to prevent, right?
L:  Um, I believe so.  I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- believe it was.  Yeah.  It was, um, what -- what can be done to prevent bioterrorism?
R:  Prevent.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Probably not -- nothing, entirely.
L:  Yeah.  Right.  I don't -- you know, know what more can be done to prevent it.  I mean, you really can't prevent -- if some- -- that's just it.  I mean, you can probably do all kinds of things to screen it and to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- try to catch it but you really can't do, probably, too much to prevent someone from trying.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't -- you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.
R:  That's true.
L:  But, um, hm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, that's interesting. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, it doesn't really, you know -- it does- -- it's not a concern of mine really.  I mean --
L:  No?
R:  -- I suppose it's a possibility but I never think -- I never have fear or anything.
L:  No.  Is that -- is that because you live in a particular area of the country that you're not worried it or ...?
R:  No.  I mean, even though I t- -- I mean, I go to third world countries all the time and, um --
L:  Ah.
R:  I don't ever think about any kind of terrorism.  You know, I --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- think about but I don't have fear of it.  I just think, you know, it's so -- the chances are really pretty dang slim and -- and if it does happen it -- it's unlikely to happen on a mass scale and although I don't wish it upon anybody else, I don't -- it does not slow me down in the slightest.
L:  Well, what -- what -- can I ask what -- why do you go to third world countries?
R:  I'm a journalist actually.
L:  Oh, wow.  That's -- that's really interesting.
R:  Yeah.  Just on a part time basis.  Just, you know, um -- I write travel stories. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So --
L:  Well, that's really cool.  I was gonna say maybe if you were a journalist covering, you know, some events like that, maybe you should be worried.  But, um, is it just  -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- more like recreational travel type of stories?
R:  Exactly.
L:  That sounds really cool.
R:  Usually it's places that are, um, exotic but they get enough money from tourism that the people aren't unhappy so they are not terrorists. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  So ...
L:  Well, that's really neat.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's cool.  Um --
R:  I've never done one of these calls before. [LAUGH]
L:  No.  This is the first one I've done too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I know that it said, like, try to stay on topic as long as you could but it said, eventually, you didn't have -- I mean, if you couldn't.  You know, that was at least the instructions I had.
R:  Yeah.  Um, and they're supposed to come in and tell us when it's --
L:  Yeah.  Right.
R:  -- been ten minutes, right?
L:  Right.  I mean, I can look f- -- um, I'm on a cellphone.  It'll tell me how long I've been on -- we've been on.
R:  Okay.
L:  Peek[?] away.  Hold on. [PAUSE] Yeah.  It looks like it's been seven and a half minutes --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- since I got the call so --
R:  Well, let's just keep talking bioterrorism.
L:  [NOISE] Sure.  Sure.  Um --
R:  Let's see ...
L:  So I mean, but of all the countries you've been to, I mean, there hasn't been any country where you've worried at all that somebody might -- because you're just -- 'cause you're an American, somebody might try to attack you or lace your food with something or ...?
R:  Never.
L:  No.
R:  No.  And you know, you hear stuff -- I don't know how much time you've spent out of the country but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when you pick up a t- -- even a Time magazine in another country, which, you know, they make different editions.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It will -- it will tell the stories vastly differently.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, than you will read it here.  And, um, I find, personally, that the media are definitely drama- +dramatizes the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- situation.
L:  Mm.
R:  And, um, although, who knows?  Maybe it's just that different people are having different experiences.  But no.  I mean I -- I've been in places where you'd imagine there would be resentment and no way.  You know, I've s- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- felt more resentment in the country than out.  For sure.
L:  Yeah.  Well, that's --
R:  So --
L:  That's cool.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  No.  I've been done a -- I've been out of the country a little bit too and I notice it's starkly different and I know that Europeans aren't really concerned about terrorism a- -- or, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- bioterrorism and that kinda thing, as we are in -- in, you know, places like England with the IRA and whatever.  They've had a lot more incidents than we have so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  There's something to be said about, you know, the American --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- you know -- y- you know, tendency to, you know, get too dramatic or too c- -- too alarmed or make a mountain out of a molehill type thing.  Not that -- obviously --
R:  Yeah.  The -- the media.  Yeah.
L:  -- there are legitimate concerns.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But yeah.  Like, as far as bioterrorism goes I mean, I -- I think that there isn't too much that can be done and I don't know.  I'm not a big proponent of, like, giving up lots of, you know, liberties or, you know -- civil liberties to try to fight it or, you know, something along those lines.
R:  Yeah.  Th- that's a provocative thing the whole Ashcroft Homeland Security.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean --
L:  Right.
R:  H- he makes it difficult to like him as well. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But -- but, um, yeah.  I mean, I think -- I don't mind giving up a few liberties but he --
L:  Right.
R:  -- frightens me.  You know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in the name of -- of security, I don't mind.  You know, I've got -- I don't have anything to hide and, you know, there's nothing that he's done so far that's cramped my style but I don't trust the man at all.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's the whole religion factor that i- is perfectly great but shouldn't be -- have anything to do with our system.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I -- I just think it's an incredibly slippery slope.  I actually don't really know that much about the man but I do -- I am pretty alarmed when I -- he -- the things I hear come out of his mouth.  Just because I -- I think he -- you give up -- you know, maybe -- maybe they are like him and others or maybe they're really concerned about trying to protect America but what about down the line and how do we know twenty years from now if somebody, you know, is more, you know -- their motivation and their office is a lot less pure and, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they've -- we've already given up all these liberties and we don't have this -- you know, like --
R:  Yeah.  Good point.
L:  -- maybe they track everything you do with your credit card now and, you know, the stuff they're talking about just -- it's, kinda, scary.
R:  Yeah.  It's true.  It's true.  I think especially with the internet too because that would seem to be fairly easy to track, you know, with the -- the ease with which people hack in.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It seems like now it's pretty hard to keep a secret.
