L:  Hi, I'm Louise.
R:  Hi, my name's Jenna[?].
L:  Jenna?
R:  Jenna.
L:  Jenna.  Hi Jenna.
R:  Hi.
L:  I guess we're supposed to tell each other --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- what, ah, the US could do to prevent --
R:  Prevent bio terrorism.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow, that's a tough question.
L:  Yes it is.
R:  I -- I'm just in college, I don't have education in such fields.  [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, I don't think college would help.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know.
L:  Ah, I -- I part -- I really think the only thing we can possibly do is that they just, um, [SIGH] have to, um, ah, just continually make us aware and remind us that, ah, this country is no longer what it used to be.  We don't have the same freedoms and, ah, to alert us to, ah, as much as possible and to, ah, [SIGH] -- to keep us apprised of all the possibilities.
R:  Yeah, um, is it -- let me look at bio terrorism, what would that include, like, biological, like --
L:  Warfare, right.
R:  -- chemical -- chemical warfare, but I -- I mean, but is it --
L:  Well, biological and ch- -- they're usually say biological and chemical.  So --
R:  Yeah.  So, I'm not sure exactly what they would mean by biochemi- -- bio whatever, you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah, like, you know, I'm, like, brain dead, I should have put that I need a -- should talk earlier in the day rather than --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- than later.
R:  Oh, that's okay.  Um, well, my husband just said --
L:  Yeah, but I -- I would have, again, [inaudible] it would be the same -- I -- when we were under high alert it's [MN] -- they alerted us that we were under high alert.  What else could they do?  They could, ah --
R:  Yeah, 'cause you can't really be like -- you can't say, "Don't do anything, don't hide", because there's no way to exp- -- like there was no way that they really could have, um, predicted --
L:  Protected us.
R:  -- like, let's say, September eleventh.
L:  Right.
R:  And you can't -- you can't predict a master m- -- you know, a master criminal.
L:  Right, except alerting us --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that, ah, they have some --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- information that may be, um, true [LAUGH] ah.
R:  But of course there's al- -- how would they know?  I mean, I think I'd read or heard somewhere there was some sort of warnings towards, ah --
L:  Well. they've -- they --
R:  -- um, like --
L:  -- overhear i- is regards talking to the prisoners --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in -- in, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Cuba or wherever they have them.
R:  Mhm [NOISE]
L:  Um, I don't know how much -- I don't think that's been happening because those prisoners have been the same that they captured right after nine eleven.  Ah, but they pick up a lot of, ah ... transmissions or, you know, pe- -- ah -- terrorists talking in different countries and --
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  -- I think here as well and -- 
R:  Appears to me they can't alert us to everything they hear though, because i- in the government you'd -- they would hear everything.
L:  No, but that's when they elevate -- if -- when -- when they hear a lot, that's when, ah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we go on high alert.
R:  Yeah, I mean --
L:  When they hear, ah, a lot from multiple sources.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, again, ah, it's like --
R:  And course, if anyone who's -- if anyone was attacking us is very good at what they're doing, you're not going to be able to hear from a lot of sources, you would think, but I don't know.
L:  Again, it's just, ah, other than alerting us that something may happen, and to keep our eyes open, that's about the only thing they can do.  I can't -- I don't think -- I lived in New York City, I just moved out of the city about a month ago --
R:  Oh, wow, hm.
L:  -- and we were under high alert more than everyone else.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And the only -- there wasn't much we could do except take certain --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- precautions but --
R:  And you can't live in fear --
L:  No. 
R:  -- either.
L:  No, and, ah, I didn't know then what it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- was that I was supposed to do and I certainly don't know now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And the government, well, obviously they [MN] --
R:  They do what they can.
L:  Right.
R:  Like, what about during the anthrax scare, that would be a biological one.  It was kind of funny.
L:  Well, what I didn't do, I didn't open my mail for a long time and --
R:  Really.
L:  -- or some people were using, ah, rubber gloves in the city because --
R:  Yeah, I'm not from any -- in -- anywhere near a city, I live in a smaller town and, you know, my pastor actually is a farmer and he just -- he kind of chuckled at it because he's had anthrax in his -- his field for years, like in the -- the field next to his, and he has to vaccinate his animals, so, it just -- it really didn't scare him at all when they had all these anthrax scares.
L:  No, I didn't think it was, ah, terrorists then, I thought it was some kook in the US --
R:  Really?
L:  -- ah --
R:  I don't -- ah, I don't know how they could of -- they can't really alert -- it's hard that you can't alert people to surprise attacks.
L:  No.
R:  So --
L:  And you've -- that's the key word, they will -- it will be a surprise.  We have to drink the water, we have to eat food, we have to --
R:  Yeah, we have to kee- -- you have to go to work, you have to do your thing.
L:  Right, and, ah --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, it's a -- it's a tough question.  Why do I always get tough ones?
L:  Well, I guess if there's going to be a next, we'll see what that one's about.
R:  Well, even so, I mean, would've thought, I mean, even with the nature of, let's say, September eleventh, which isn't really biological I would suppose, but in a terrorist attack, how could anyone predict, you know, millions of people ride airplanes every day and --
L:  Yeah, the only -- again, the having lived in a large city, the only thing is, I wasn't -- I didn't take as many risks as I would have, um --
R:  Mhm, pre -- 
L:  -- and I didn't go to, ah, attend concerts.  Unfortunately I was afraid to do a lot of things.  One of the reasons I moved out, I -- i- it no longer was what it used to be to me.  I didn't --
R:  It scared you.
L:  -- feel free to, ah -- to do much and I didn't like living on high alert.
R:  Yeah.  I guess that would be hard, but, yeah, I live a different life, I live in the middle of nowhere, ha, so, it just -- it doesn't -- we don't even have tall -- really tall buildings here, I don't want you to think I live on a -- in a hole in the ground but, ha, you know, it's a different, I think, it's a very different perspective we have and I would imagine you're a little older and a bit -- a little more experienced and --
L:  Yeah, and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- having lived in one of the cities that it happened --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, though my family, who doesn't -- didn't live there, um, was concerned -- very concerned about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- me, I don't think they fully understood what that fear was because they didn't live there and, like --
R:  [LIPSMACK] You know, I don't think we could.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And, um, but again, [SIGH] this answer [MN].
R:  Who could be on alert, I suppose being informed.
L:  Being informed, that's what I sh- -- that's --
R:  [NOISE] Um --
L:  -- the word I said [MN].
R:  I -- I wonder how they -- they -- how anyone could of really informed [NOISE], like obviously to watch out for suspicious parking and pl- -- you know, things like that, but like -- like for me it seems so --
L:  I am more aware than I ever was.  I mean I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- e- espe- -- in particular I mean again to mention the city, I have to say, since I moved to New Jersey, I'm not as, ah, thoughtful about anything --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, and I -- that could be bad, but --
R:  [NOISE] Mm.
L:  -- um, or as alert -- I just notice the seeming -- seemingly when I was living in the city I n- -- I pretty much was aware of everything --
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- in my immediate surroundings --
R:  Different people and [inaudible] --
L:  -- you know, any pe- -- well, everybody looks suspicious to me for a while.
R:  Well, I s- -- I suppose it's hard -- it's hard not to be prejudiced I would assume ... maybe not, but --
L:  Well, yes, I mean, obviously that's very unfair but, ah ... people at --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- at least a year after couldn't help that, just being suspicious of anyone who looked Middle Eastern.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but I guess we don't have an answer, I -- I don't have an answer, I -- certainly I couldn't suggest anything and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I guess, hopefully our ten minutes is going to be up soon.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  May I ask where you do live?
R:  Yep, North Dakota.
L:  Oh.
R:  So --
L:  Interesting.
R:  Yeah, it's, you know, I just, I don't have a lot of fears and such thing and --
L:  Well, again, you're -- you are more sheltered there.
R:  Oh, true.  We don't have -- there's no -- there would be nothing to attack here, I mean, you know, the -- we don't ha- -- there's nothing here.
L:  Well, if it was biological or chemical, if I -- I -- I -- I -- I hate to say it, but you can't help wondering why, it'll be two years in a few months, [LIPSMACK] um, but evidently they broke up mo- -- a good number of the cells, there are just -- but you would think that they would try to, um, i- instead of just hitting certain cities or certain areas that they would do w- -- harm across the nation.
R:  I don't know, if, yeah.
L:  But fortunately they don't have the, ah, ability.  Yeah.
R:  The people or the power.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, that would kind of make -- or take out strategic --
L:  Because sometimes I did wonder, not necessarily North Dakota, but I thought of all the states --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that you would never think anything would happen, but then again, you don't know how they think, and they may do that.
R:  But you would never think that something would happen to a symbol of, you know, our business industry in America, you know what I mean?
L:  Well, yeah, we never, but -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it makes more sense to do something like that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because they want -- they wanted to make an impact --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and unfortunately they did.
