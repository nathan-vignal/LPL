L:  Huh, my name's Mary.  [LAUGH].
R:  Wow.
L:  How are you?
R:  Fine.
L:  Good.  Um, so it's sports.  What kind of sports do you like?
R:  Um, I like to watch the wrestling.

L:  Ah, there you go.  There you go.  I do um N.F.L. and Nascar.  
R:  Oh, wow.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].  So um you know, there's a couple of different uh kind of sports there, huh?  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  This the first time you do this survey here?
L:  This is my second one.
R:  Okay.  Well, this is my first so I'm kinda like --
L:  Is it?  
R:  -- it's weird.
L:  Oh, gosh --
R:  I didn't know I get to talk to a actual person.
L:  Yeah, yeah, and you know, it's funny because you've never seen ten minutes last so long in your life [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  There's only so much that --
R:  Especially when it's a stranger you're talking to, huh?
L:  Right.  You know, there's only so much --
R:  So I guess we better talk about sports.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
R:  So you -- you -- you -- you don't watch -- your kids, that don't watch wrestling, like W.W.F. or anything like that?
L:  Well, they -- they used to, but now -- you know, they -- they went through a stage with it, you know, um --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  -- like, back when the Rock was it and --
R:  Yeah, they really loved it.
L:  -- Triple As and whatever.
R:  Mine -- mine did too.
L:  Um, you know, now they've gotten out of it and it's -- you know, my husband and myself, we watch um football and -- and Nascar, like I said.
R:  And -- and my brother likes Nascar.  My brother, he -- he moved away.  He's in Houston now, but he like -- he really liked Rusty Walters or something, I don't know.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Rusty.
R:  Who that is, but -- 
L:  Yeah, Rusty Walters.
R:  -- we -- when we were going to stores and he always wants to buy his shirts or whatever and --
L:  The number two.
R:  -- I was -- yeah.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Number two, yeah.  We used to watch Dale Earnhardt, and um, you know follow him and then when he -- he got killed --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- two years ago and now we follow his son and -- hi- basically his racing team, which is Dale Earnhardt Incorporated, um, and I believe he's got three cars out there, so --
R:  Wow.  And what else you said you liked?  N.F.L.?
L:  Yeah.  The football.  
R:  Okay.  So did you like the team with [inaudible]?  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  Which one?  
R:  [inaudible].
L:  Who's -- I -- I --
R:  Um, he was a -- he was big time N.F.L. player.  I don't -- I think he played for the Giants or whatever.  Um -- um --
L:  We wa- we follow the Patriots and um, um --
R:  I think he was the Giants.  [inaudible] he was --
L:  And Miami.  I mean, we're in Florida, so of course, we --
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  And I'm in Louisiana, so --
L:  Oh, there you go.
R:  -- we kinda -- yeah.  [LAUGH].  We're not too far away.
L:  There you go.  And we moved from New England so that's why we, you know, follow --
R:  The Patriots?
L:  -- the Patriots, right.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Right.  So those are the -- those are the ones that we follow, but um you know, I don't -- I don't know --
R:  So --
L:  -- the whole league, of course, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Okay.  I know a few -- I only know a few, the ones the children like and stuff, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  But --
L:  Yeah.  All the jerseys you see wearing around, right?  [LAUGH].
R:  And what about basketball?  You don't --
L:  You know, we've never followed basketball.  Like, I mean, m- myself personally, I don't understand --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the game.  I don't understand the positions and you know, so it's hard for me to follow.  Um --
R:  And I watch it with the kids 'cause they love it and then they play it a lot so you know I kinda like -- they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they play for school and stuff, and I really don't know everything about it, but it's nice to watch the guys --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the cute guys, so I like it because [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- of that, you know?  I mean --
L:  Right.
R:  You know, 'cause --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's what they like, so --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So -- so do you watch, um, like all -- all of the basketball games and the play offs --
R:  No, I mostly --
L:  -- and all that?
R:  -- like the big teams, like you know, like Shaquille O'Neal or you know, what --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- Kobe Bryant with the Stars.  Those are the ones they like.
L:  Right, right.
R:  So you know, we don't too much watch all of it.  Mostly their games.  I think it's like four or five games they'll follow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah, that's -- we watch like Nascar every week and then when it's football season, we're flipping the channels back and forth 'cause the games are on at the same time the race is on.  [LAUGH].
R:  So is there, like, Nascar driving there?  'Cause I remember once on -- online, I won --
L:  In --
R:  -- tickets to go somewhere to some big show, but I couldn't go way there, so I sold the tickets.  It was --
L:  Oh, there you --
R:  -- some big race car thing or something.
L:  Yeah, they got, um, the Homestead Raceway now.
R:  I think it was -- it said Nascar on the tickets, but I don't know where it was.  I think it may have been in Georgia or somewhere, I don't know --
L:  Yeah, they're all through the -- you know, all through the south.  But um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think Homestead only opened, like, three years ago.
R:  Okay.
L:  Three or four years ago.  I'm not positive with that, but --
R:  We have, like, you know, we're like deep country so mostly you'll see 'em like drag racing or something [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  You don't see big --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- time, like, races like you all see out there.  [LAUGH].
L:  Right, right.
R:  So --
L:  Right.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Well, they got the -- you know, they do the straight line and we watch that every once in a while, the drag racing, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, when we were a lot younger, when me and my husband were teenagers, we used to have a um car we dragged.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And --and you all raced it?
L:  Yep.  Yeah.  We brought it to --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- the drag strip and my husband --
R:  Wow, that's always exciting.
L:  This -- this is when we were, like, teenagers.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  He built the car.  He -- he rebuilt the engine and brought it down to the drags and it -- it did pretty good.  It was pretty quick.  He never lasted a race, so --
R:  Wow.  [LAUGH].
L:  It was fun.  It was fun.  We used to have a lot of fun. 
R:  You know, I'm the complete opposite.  I think I don't watch it because I'm -- I'm like -- stuff like that scares me.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
R:  You know what I mean?  It's really scary.  I'm on the highway doing, like, fifty five, everybody better pass me 'cause --
L:  pa- [LAUGH].
R:  -- I'm so cautious.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And to watch 'em like that, and then they flip over, like, fifty times and they get out of the car and I'd be like, oh my goodness --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- this is not real.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Well, they -- they've really done a lot to -- they've really done a lot to um -- to uh -- up to --
R:  Yeah, they got something, they'll show the cars catching on fire and the person still gets out alive and I'm like, you know, oh no.
L:  Yeah.  But the roll cages and stuff, I mean, and -- and now like um -- uh, what you may call it, when Dale Earnhardt --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- got killed --
R:  Yeah, I saw it.  
L:  -- he um --
R:  I saw it there --
L:  -- he didn't have that.
R:  -- 'cause they played it a lot.  That's how I knew about that, because I saw it on TV.  They played it quite a bit, so --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, he um -- he didn't have the neck brace on so his head was detached from [LAUGH] his body --
R:  He -- he was decapitated?  
L:  He -- it didn't come off, but it was, um --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- it -- it -- it separated from his spinal cord.
R:  Oh, my goodness.  I thought he had burned.  The car didn't catch on fire or something?
L:  No.  No, he hit the wall doing about two hundred and twenty miles an hour.
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  You know?  About --
R:  So now his son, his son is younger?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's um -- I think he's twenty five or twenty six years old.  He's -- he's actually got three kids that are in racing and then another little one.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, he was married, like, three times and -- and whatever, but there's -- he's got two boys in racing and he's got one um daughter who's in racing and then he has a very young daughter.
R:  Okay.  Wow.
L:  But --
R:  So do you have parties and watch the race, and like the Super Bowl parties and stuff like that?
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH].
L:  Not so much for -- for the racing, but for the football, big time.  [LAUGH].
R:  Big time, yeah.  
L:  Big time.
R:  House full of people screaming, drinking beer --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- like they show on TV?  Yeah.
L:  Absolutely.  [LAUGH].  
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Absolutely.  Even some of the games, like the play off games, you know, they get intense and you -- you'll be walking past the front and you hear, "Yay, yay, yay, yay" [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Get out of the way.  Yes.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]. You know?
R:  My ch- my -- my children mostly it's like the -- the -- with the wrestling, they'll get like all their little teenagers, so the -- the friends to come over and they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like go wild for that.  They -- they on the floor, in the middle of the floor doing the moves and trying to hurt each other and that.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And I'm screaming, "Stop, stop".  It's like they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- do everything they see them do, you know?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  They think it's real, but I try to tell them --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that's not real.  
L:  Absolutely.
R:  You know?  Huh.  And -- and to me, it's got a little more raunchy.  I mean, it used to be pretty cool to watch, but now you get on there, they got women and they talking dirty, you know, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- it's -- it's -- it's a little too much than what --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- it used to be, so --
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  They --
R:  Yeah.  And I try to tell them there, but they're teenagers.  I have, like, a fourteen year old and a eighteen year old --
L:  [NOISE].
R:  -- so they, like, they really --
L:  I got -- I got a --
R:  -- into it.
L:  -- sixteen year old boy and a fourteen year old girl and --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- then a six year old boy.  
R:  Wow.  [LAUGH].
L:  So [LAUGH] I got a little bit --
R:  Yeah, I have two boys.
L:  -- you know, once they get into teenagers and you got all kinds of different, um, problems and oh my --
R:  So you think, um I know they cut you off, but do you think they go back and they listen to what we talked about or how do they do this?
L:  I don't know.  I have no idea, but --
R:  This is kinda weird.
L:  -- the ones that I --
R:  [LAUGH].  I mean, I never done this before, so I mean --
L:  Yeah, no.  I -- and you know what, too?  Is -- just to let you know, is you do -- you don't get paid right away.
R:  Uh-huh?
L:  After you do -- I think you do three surveys and then it takes six weeks after that, and you start getting checks.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  But it's --
R:  I did --
L:  -- ten dollars for every survey, so --
R:  Yeah.  So it -- I guess you can't be --
L:  -- you know, it's a --
R:  -- there, you know, to talk about things that interest you or whatever, you know, but --
L:  Well, exactly.
R:  -- sports, I guess, wasn't -- just wasn't a very good talk -- topic for us, seeing that we're women, but --
L:  Right.  [LAUGH].
R:  -- I'm sure there's not as many men that probably even want to do this type of thing.
L:  Right.  I'm sure --
R:  So you know?
L:  I'm sure there's not, and do you do survey things, like, on the computer too or --
R:  Yes.  I do it -- I do a few.
L:  Yeah.
R:  With the Pine Cone and --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  -- places like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Sure.
R:  Yeah, this is -- you know, in free time, to have something to do --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to make a little money on the side, 'cause I'm a student.  I'm a nursing student so I kinda --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- try to make a little money on the side.  
L:  Do you do, um, My Survey?  That's another good one.  You -- you do, um -- it's called My Survey dot com.
R:  Yeah.  I heard of them, but they don't often send me a lot of stuff.
L:  You know what?  The more you go on and check, like, if you go -- if -- if you sign up for it and then you -- like, for two weeks go in on a daily --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- basis to see if there's any surveys --
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- they'll start sending you them hand over fist.  I mean, and you can make a thousand points in no time and then it -- you know, that's ten bucks, you know?
R:  Wow, I didn't know that.
L:  And they send you -- they send you products to test.  Like, I've done paper towel stuff, teeth write -- whitener.
R:  Well, I've done a lot of that kinda stuff, like there for Pine Cone.  I've been --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- doing a lot of product -- oh, excuse me, testing for them, but I've never really gotten into My Survey.  I just thought they wouldn't, you know --
L:  Yeah.  I do a lot for My Survey.
R:  Well, I must take your advice --
L:  This is -- you know, when I had -- I had, like um -- I don't know, I had -- you know, you fill out the thing for this one on the days you -- you're available and the hours or not?
R:  Mhm?
L:  And I filled -- within --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the last few weeks, have been so crazy, with the kids getting out of school and --
R:  Yeah, that's --
L:  -- wanting to go here and wanting to go there, that they had called me, like, eight times and --
R:  Yeah, they been calling me every day, yeah --
