L:  Uh, you can go first.
R:  Okay [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Well, I'm not much of a -- a sports fan, but I do enjoy um baseball.  Uh, the Atlanta Braves are my favorite sports -- baseball players.  [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm?
R:  Um, don't watch it uh the way I should, uh, but I definitely read a lot -- a lot about it in the -- in the newspaper.
L:  Mhm?
R:  And um I um am very proud of them this year.  They did quite well.
L:  Have they?  I -- yeah, I don't really watch a lot of sports either.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  The only thing I do watch is um like if they have those dance competitions, like gymnastics and things --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I kinda like to watch those, but other than that, I'm not really --
R:  Well, I'm not --
L:  -- into sports either [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Well, I'm not much of a -- a television watcher anyway.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I uh -- so but, you know, I do read the sports on Sunday mornings and see what they're doing and -- and I try to catch it whenever I can.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, my cousin, David Justin, used to play uh with the Atlanta Braves until he went someplace else.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  So did you get to go to the games a lot when he played?
R:  Well, actually we -- we weren't living in Georgia at the time.
L:  Oh, uh-huh.
R:  We were in [inaudible].  We just moved to Georgia about a year ago.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But it was always nice watching, and says,  "I'm -- I'm related to him".  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, definitely.  [LAUGH].
R:  And uh when he married Halle Berry, you know, that was a big thing.
L:  Oh, uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  Um, but uh, I just uh -- as I said, they -- they did quite well this year in -- in -- in uh playing, and they um -- I really enjoyed when -- what I did read about it, but um, um --
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, I live um around about an hour from St Louis, Missouri.
R:  Do you?
L:  So um I've been to a couple of Cardinals' games this year.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I'm not a real big fan, doesn't really care, but I kinda like --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- to go, the atmosphere's kinda fun and just kinda be outdoors.
R:  I -- yeah, yeah, yeah.  Um --
L:  My boyfriend's a big Cardinals' fan too, so --
R:  Is he?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, he loves 'em, so --
R:  Ah.  Uh-huh.
L:  -- he gets really into it.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].  Okay.  Um, we um -- I think we went to one of the games here.
L:  Mhm?
R:  When they were playing here in uh Georgia.
L:  Mhm?
R:  And I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I -- I just -- I gets real excited when I do go.
L:  Yeah, it's a lot different when you see it in person.
R:  But I need to, you know, have almost uh, throat surgery afterward [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  From yelling so much?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.
R:  And yeah --
L:  That's -- I think we're gonna try to go down some time this -- well, before the summer's up, and rent one of those rooms, like get a bunch of people together and have one of those --
R:  Where?  In where?
L:  -- rooms that kinda overlooks the stadium and --
R:  Where?
L:  -- stuff.  
R:  Where?
L:  So I hope we get to do that.
R:  Yeah.  That -- that's a lot of fun in that, right?
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  And get enough people.  If you have the time.
R:  I know.
L:  Seems like there's never time.
R:  I know.  I know.  Um --
L:  So um --
R:  Do you have favorite players?
L:  No.  You know, I really don't follow them.  I just kind of -- I know the names and -- well, in the last game that we went to, we went around back and waited for the -- some of the players to come out and --
R:  Did you?
L:  -- I didn't even recognize any of 'em but um my boyfriend did get one autograph of --
R:  Oh.  Oh.
L:  -- somebody, I can't remember the name, but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- he did get an autograph on the baseball, so he was all excited --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- about that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Well, I'm horrible on names anyway.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, it -- and I -- I mean, I -- I know the face when I see it.  Uh, see a face, oh, oh, that's so and so, but you know, I -- I just have a hard time remembering names of who's playing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And the reason I remember David is because I was related to him [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  And um --
L:  So --
R:  So uh how -- uh, did you -- what did you say, you liked basketball or the -- the baseball -- what else did you say?
L:  Oh, no, I like the dance competitions.
R:  Oh, the dance competitions?  Yeah.
L:  Like -- yeah.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I think those are fun to watch and like the -- when they have those um, oh, like the weightlifting for women.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And they do like dance competitions.  Like, it's not really weightlifting, but they kind of like do the dance moves and they, like, show how strong they are.  Like, with pushups and different things --
R:  Uh-huh.  I see.
L:  -- I don't know, I just think it's neat.  I always wished I could do that stuff.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  It looks like a lot of fun, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I -- like, I'm like you, I barely watch T.V. either.  I just never have time.
R:  I don't have time either, yeah.
L:  Seems like -- and if I do turn it on, I fall asleep in front of it.
R:  Me, too.  I -- I -- I -- 
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- I -- I will turn it on and it -- with all intentions of watching the game, right?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And the television's in my bedroom --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and when I wake up, someone else is on and I'm, now, wha- what happened?
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Miss all the show.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  And I just --
R:  So in --
L:  I just got a new cable upgrade so I have a lot of the sports channels I didn't have before, but --
R:  Do you really?
L:  Even though -- uh, and I watch golf every once in a while too even though I just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- took golfing lessons this um -- this winter and so I'm -- I'm kinda a little familiar with the game and I kinda watch it and see if I can remember, you know, how to do it and stuff, but I'm -- I'm not very good at it.  [LAUGH].
R:  I'm awf- I -- I'm fascinated with uh Tiger Woods and the way he plays.
L:  Oh, uh-huh.
R:  I mean, he's so young and he's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- doing so well with that golfing thing, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And uh I -- I do watch that when he's playing and -- and -- and I can kinda follow it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, yeah, and uh -- and uh when um what's his name was playing, uh, uh -- Michael --
L:  I like --
R:  -- Jordan was playing.
L:  Oh, uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  I uh -- I -- I loved to watch that basketball.  Yeah, as -- as a matter of fact, that's the only I watched basketball.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Was when he was playing.
L:  When he --
R:  I loved to see him play.
L:  Yeah, he is good.
R:  Yeah.  And uh yeah.  I'm sorry that he's retired, but I guess it's about time.
L:  Well yeah, he's kinda getting up there.  I mean, not old, but I mean, to be playing basketball still --
R:  Yeah and I think --
L:  -- and --
R:  -- his knee and stuff was bothering him, too, was --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- one of the reasons that he had uh stopped playing basketball.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, but he went out with a bang.
L:  He definitely did.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, he did.  Yeah.
L:  That's for sure.
R:  Uh-huh.  Do you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like anything else, other than the dancing uh --
L:  Not really.  I'm not really not into sports that much.
R:  Mm.
L:  I mean, I'll -- you know, if -- like I said, like, if you go to like a baseball game, it's a lot better being there, you know --
R:  Is -- yeah, yeah.
L:  -- with the atmosphere and stuff that --
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  -- I really can't just sit there and watch it on T.V.  It just doesn't hold my attention long enough.
R:  Yeah.  I --
L:  Seems like --
R:  I don't like uh don't like especially football.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I get so upset --
L:  No, I don't -- I don't really like it either.
R:  -- what they gonna do.  Oh, they just kinda fall on top of everybody, oh my God.
L:  [LAUGH].  And so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  My brother used to play football in high school and uh --
R:  He did?
L:  -- I didn't like to go to the games even 'cause I couldn't stand watching him, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- tackling each --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- other and stuff.
R:  Mm.  Mm, mm.
L:  It's just -- I don't know, you wonder how sometimes how they even get up and walk away --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- from the uh --
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I guess he's all grown up now, huh?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  He's -- yep.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  He's older, so and he had --
R:  Is this your time calling in?
L:  Huh?
R:  Is this your first time calling in?
L:  Yeah, it is.  
R:  Yeah, me too. 
L:  Yeah.  I wasn't quite sure what to expect.
R:  Neither was I.  I -- er I know they insisted that we stick to the topic of, you know, what they want us to talk about --
L:  Right.
R:  -- sports on T.V. or something like that, but when you're not well di- versed in it, it's kinda hard to [LAUGH].
L:  I know, that's when I heard what the topic was, I thought, oh great, this is like the worst one they could pick for me because --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm not into sports at all.
R:  So I'm glad that, you know, I got somebody who uh [LAUGH] doesn't know much about it --
L:  Doesn't like it either?  [LAUGH].
R:  -- yeah [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.
L:  So how did you hear about this study?
R:  Um, money and shopping -- the money shopping network.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Uh, uh mystery shopping and -- network.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Uh, have you been plugged into that?
L:  What's the website?
R:  Uh, it's uh www dot money and shopping dot net.  
L:  No, I haven't heard of that one.
R:  Ah.  It's a -- it's a mystery shopping -- you know --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- it's -- yeah.
L:  I've done some of that before.  I did it um oh what was it called?  I can't -- I -- did a lot for county market grocery stores.
R:  Oh, did you?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And um --
R:  I um -- yeah, yeah.
L:  But it said mon- money and shopping dot net?  Is that what you said?
R:  Yeah, uh-huh.
L:  Yeah, I have to check that out.
R:  Yo- you can join for, like, I think it's forty seven dollars for the li- for the lifetime.  They give you a lot of good leads.  
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  And when I go into go ahead and decide to do it, I just um -- I -- I can work constantly, you know?
L:  Mhm?
R:  Yeah, but we gotta get back to the subject.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I suppose, yeah.  Um, let's see.  What else?  Well, the one thing I do like is um swimming.
R:  Do you?
L:  Yeah.  I -- I just put a pool up actually in my yard, too.  It's only like a three foot pool by --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- twelve foot, but that is one of my favorite things to do.  I -- I don't really consider it a sport, but I guess it kinda is.
R:  Well, it is kind of a sport because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, they do have swimming competitions on T.V. don't they?
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And in the Olympics, they always have --
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  -- have that a big -- big deal with that, but yeah, at my old apartment complex, we had a big pool there and I loved it.  I just -- I miss not having a pool so I had to go get -- get my one and --
R:  Mm.  Mhm.
L:  So I love to swim.
R:  Well, you live in a house now?
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I just -- actually, I just filled my pool up last night so --
R:  Did you? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  I wish it was deeper, 'cause it's just fun to swim around.  You feel like you're weightless, you know?
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  Just floating around.
R:  I -- yeah, yeah.  Um --
L:  So um --
R:  Well, I guess you know, as I -- I -- ne- neither one of us two does -- has diversed on the sport things on T.V.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, and I called in once before and they was gonna talk about the time machine.  So --
L:  That -- the movie?
R:  -- I -- I -- I [LAUGH] a scenario with a time machine.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  Either way, I hung up.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I'd say.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's a weird subject.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Um, this is -- this is kind of an interesting thing to do, though I guess, right?
L:  Yeah, it is.  It -- it really is.  I --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- like I said before, I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but I mean --
R:  How did you find out about it?
L:  Um, a website called uh Freelance by U dot com.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Have you heard of that?
R:  Mm um.  
L:  That is a -- I subscribe to the newsletter and um it -- she just sends you emails every day with, like, different things and this is one of the things that was listed on there.
R:  Oh, really?
