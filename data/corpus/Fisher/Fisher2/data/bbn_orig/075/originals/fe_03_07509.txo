R:  My name's Larry Calwell[?].
L:  [LIPSMACK] My name's Michelle Fletchman[?].
R:  Pleased to meet ya.
L:  Nice to meet you.
R:  So, what do you think we can do?
L:  Um, it -- I don't think we can do anything to really prevent it except have good relations with other countries that might be our enemy, you know?  Like, ah -- I mean, I don't really know [LAUGH] that much about politics so it's, kind of, a hard topic.  But --
R:  Yeah.
L:  A- and I think that our best bet would be to, ah --
R:  To always be on watch.  You know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, just -- always.  In the grocery stores even.  I mean, it could be food, you know?  Be --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- contaminated food that we don't even know is contaminated 'cause we haven't watched close enough.  You know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  It just -- it -- when it gets to the grocery, I mean, that's pretty bad.  You know?
L:  Yeah.  I don't know.  I think, like, I'd feel a lot safer if I -- I knew that countries didn't hate us and, like, people didn't hate us.  Just like in any other thing, you know, like, y- y- you worry about, like, people -- you worry about your enemies -- you don't worry about your friends, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  So, if we were friends with all the countries, we're friends with, like, everybody in the world.
R:  Well, I mean, you know, our students, you know -- we have exchange students and such.  You know, it goes there too.  If you treat them well, I mean, what would we have to worry about?  You know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, it could -- it could really lessen the threat of terrorism if we were just decent to the people that we go to school with even.
L:  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's like -- [PAUSE] ah, I -- I think that are country does a lot to, like, aggravate other countries.  And I mean, I think the countries that we're afraid of, like, it's on, like, a religious level.  Like, they're na- -- w- we try to, like, impose American customs on, like, Arabs and --
R:  Like, our way is the best way or no way at all.
L:  Yeah.  I --
R:  Is that what you're saying?
L:  What?
R:  Are you saying, like, our way is the best way and there's no way at all is what we present?
L:  That's what we present, yeah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But we shouldn't.  I mean, even if --
R:  No.
L:  -- that's what we think and even if they do things that we think is, like, really wrong, like --
R:  I know.  Because they've been there for thousands of years in places, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I mean, they had to know something to be there that long.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, our country's a young country.  It's prosperous but it's young.  You know, you take China.  You know what I mean?  And Japan and all the -- I mean, all these different places, you know?  Iraq --
L:  Yes.
R:  Iraq even.  You know, w- we tear their country up just to build it back.  Now, ain't that ridiculous?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I mean, that's enough to cause terrorism.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  I don't know.  But I mean, it's -- it's -- it's almost too late to, like, go back and fix our relations.  I think that, like [MN] -- I don't know.  I'm not really a fan of our current president and I think that he has screwed up so much already.  Are you?
R:  Ah, I'm not -- I'm really not.  I'm a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm really unhappy with him.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I think that he -- he's, like, done a lot that I'm just, like, "No".  I think -- I mean, to, like, b- b- break down statues when we conquer another country, like, that's not gonna, like, annoy them and piss them off even more and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- make them -- I don't know.
R:  You know, and I mean it -- we go over there looking for one thing that we never found.  You know?  I mean, we found bits and pieces of things and it looked like it might've been.  But now we're building the country back.  We're gonna make it a democratic country -- or try to.  And I mean, it would make me mad if I was a countryman in their country to think that, "Hey, you said that you were coming over here because of all the chemicals and different things like that".  Well, they never showed up.  But it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- do we hear about it that much?  No.  We don't hear much about it at all.  I mean, that's enough to cause terrorism.  I mean, we was butting into something that w- -- that never would've been bothered if it'd been left alone.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, maybe.
L:  They've --
R:  You know, maybe.
L:  -- gotten -- I mean, we also, like -- I don't know if, like, [LAUGH] mm -- our potential enemies know, like, what biased and skewed views we see through our media.  I mean, that causes terrorism too.  I mean, if, like, I -- that -- that's gotta, like, irritate them.  Like, I'm, like -- I'm Jewish but I know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that, like, that -- that m- -- when I hear, like, Palestinians are bad, Palestinians are killing the Jews -- I know that, like -- I mean, I -- I love Israel but, like, I know that that's not really true.  But a lot of people don't, you know?  And, like, it's -- it's, like, ignorance.  I mean, okay, so I guess that's another way to prevent bioterrorism and terrorism at all is, like, truth and, like, ending ignorance.
R:  Let us be -- well[?], honest with each other.  You know?  Face each other face to face and say, "Hey, look -- if you don't be good, I'm gonna kill ya".  You know? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know?  I mean, just be --
L:  [inaudible] Yeah.
R:  You know, be straight forward with it, you know?  Don't -- don't be sitting there hiding behind the bushes and gonna throw something or run planes into buildings and kill millions -- I mean, thousands of people.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  I mean, that's -- I mean, that's grounds for war there in my opinion.  When the Trade Centers went down, that was grounds for war.  But who do we go against?  You know what I mean?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Iraq was the first for now[?].
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  And I mean, it's just -- I'm really not educated enough about it but I mean, it's just -- it was grounds for war but it needed to be something that instead of saying, "We're coming in here to find these chemicals because you have, ah -- I can't think of the name of it -- m- missiles that're, you know, ah, ultimate death and all this and chemical warfare and all this kind of stuff -- and we're gonna take 'em".  Well, they looked and looked and looked and never found anything.  Found empty canisters and different things like that but that was about it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  And I mean --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it was just aggravating.  Enough to make you say, "Okay, Mr President -- you need a spanking" you know? [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I don't know.  What kind of, like, bioterrorist threats are going on right now?  I don't even know.  I haven't really heard that much.
R:  Well, I haven't either.  I mean --
L:  I mean, since, like, the anthrax scare really.
R:  Yeah.  That's what I was trying to think of.
L:  Unless SARS is.  It -- they don't -- oh, yeah -- they found it out of a monkey or something, right?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Something like that.  Everything's from a monkey anymore.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know what I mean? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I guess.
R:  [LAUGH] You know what I mean?  This is true.  You know what I mean?  But if they just teach it to carry it and let it go they'd have the best terrorist on the face of the earth.  You know what I mean?
L:  Mhm.
R:  It could climb buildings, it could -- you know, do -- make friends and everything else and destroy you.  So, they'd give it a disease to spread to everybody, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Well, I don't know.  I guess -- I don't know.  I'm -- it -- it doesn't really bother me.  I haven't really thought about bioterrorism [LAUGH] until I was --
R:  No.
L:  -- told to talk about it.
R:  I haven't either.
L:  It doesn't really -- I don't know. [several inaudible words]
R:  Until it comes to my front door.  When it comes to my front door, my -- you know -- I mean, when it comes to my country, I serve my country -- I was in the army.  You know?  But I mean, when it comes to my front door, then I'm concerned.  You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, like, here in Oklahoma -- that's where I'm from -- we had the -- the Murrah Building this[?] was destroyed.  You know, had the bombing up there and, ah -- which they killed Tim McVeigh, which I don't blame 'em.  But then after that then the Towers go down.  And I mean, it makes you -- you know, it's -- it's scary --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if you really think about it.  But I try not to think about it too much.  I try to think about, "Hey, I'm in a free world right now.  Nobody's walking up to me with a gun and telling me that I have to do this".
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  I mean, I guess, like, I'm on the East Coast and so a little bit more, like, closer and, like, my brother works at the State Department in Washington and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- he -- like, I know when it was all going on with the anthrax he got, like, whatever the, like -- like, ah, vaccination, like -- th- the medicine they're giving out.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  He had to take that.  And that's kinda weird but I was still, like -- it's not like he's -- he doesn't do anything.  He, like, answers the phone at the State Department.
R:  Yeah.
L:  He's not gonna get anthrax.  And I'm in Boston and, like -- I don't know.  It doesn't -- I don't think I anybody's gonna comes[?], like --
R:  I got a friend in +Amherst.  I mean, not +Amherst, ah, Am- -- ah --
L:  Amherst?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, I haven't talked to her in a long time but ...  Um ...
L:  Mm. [PAUSE] 
R:  But, ah -- well see, like, smallpox -- what about if there was an epidemic of smallpox?  And when they say bio, you know what they mean.  You know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they're afraid to give out the -- the -- the im- immu- immunization because of death.  I mean, that's pretty bad.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, ah, I mean, if they was to isolate the germ and really hit us with it, what would we do?
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  And I mean, a terrorist is a terrorist.  When it says terrorist they mean that they will go to any length.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  They're -- they're -- it don't matter, you know?  Ah, there's no rules to war when it comes to being a terrorist.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  It's really scary ones, like, th- these suicide people 'cause --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they -- they could just do anything and, like --
R:  Well, see Japanese --
L:  -- and they have.
R:  -- had 'em in World War Two.
L:  Well, yeah.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  That's true.
R:  But, ah -- ah --
L:  Mm.
R:  Yeah.  They had the kamikazes, you know?  Eee --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Fly planes into everywhere.  You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, ah, um ... [NOISE] Scary.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know?
L:  America doesn't have that.  Nobody has, like, enough pride in America --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- especially right now to, like --
R:  Die for it.  Our soldiers are dying for it.
L:  Well, I mean, I guess, like -- that's true.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But it's not, like, a sure death.
R:  They use our heads.
L:  You know, I -- for the -- some[?] of them are going there m- -- it usually is.
R:  Yeah.  I mean -- well, the -- you know, they use our heads.  Instead of somebody giving their life on the l- -- ah --
L:  They're -- but they're, like -- th- they're not try- -- they're not going out there with the intention of dying.  I don't think anybody would.
R:  Right.  We're gonna live for our country -- we're not gonna die for our country.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You can say we're gonna die for our country every day but we're gonna live for our country.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's -- that's more of a reward than dying.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Mm.  Yeah.
R:  But ...  You know?  It's just -- that's the way I look at it.  You know, I mean, my sergeants, you know -- I mean, I didn't put my life on the line.  Okay, I go to war.  I'm out there, bullets flying -- if it kills me, it kills me -- if it don't, it don't.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I would've done it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I wouldn't have done it because of, you know -- saying that I'm gonna die for my coun- -- I'm not out there to die for [LAUGH] my country.  I'm gonna live, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Survive.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or at least try to. [LAUGH] You know?  I don't know.  Did you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- say you was from Boston?
L:  Yeah.  I go to school.
R:  What -- what is -- oh, you go to school?  That's what I was doing.
L:  Yeah.  I'm a student.
R:  I'm gonna start back here pretty soon hopefully.
L:  Mm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yep.
R:  But, ah --
L:  Well ... [PAUSE] Hm.
R:  Well, these are a long ten minutes aren't they?
L:  Yeah.  How long has this been?
R:  Yeah.  I don't know.  I have no idea.
L:  Ah ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Hm. [LAUGH] All right. [LAUGH] Just -- what else can I[?] say?
R:  But, ah -- you know, but one thing that really scares me though, ah, being bios[?] if they get to messing with the food.  You know, they got all these b- -- ah, what is it?  Ah, the cow -- mad cow disease.  You know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and different things like that.
