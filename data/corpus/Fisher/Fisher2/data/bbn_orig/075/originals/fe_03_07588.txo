L:  Hi, I'm Vicky.
R:  Hello, Vicky.  I'm Margaret.  
L:  Hi, Margaret.  
R:  Where do you live?
L:  Uh, Massachusetts.  And you?
R:  Mississippi.
L:  Oh, boy.  [LAUGH].
R:  It's raining there --
L:  Well, the topic is -- the topic is sports, I hear?
R:  Yes.  
L:  And I have to laugh because I'm on my cell phone, watching my daughter's softball game.
R:  Oh, really?  
L:  [LAUGH].  
R:  I love to wa-
L:  So I'm more of a -- a hands on sports person than watching it on TV.
R:  Yeah.
L:  How about you?
R:  I don't watch on TV at all.
L:  [LAUGH].  
R:  I hate sports on TV.  
L:  What makes --
R:  But --
L:  -- you hate it?
R:  What now?  What did you --
L:  What -- why do you hate it on TV?
R:  It -- just don't like to watch it.
L:  Yeah.  I find it very boring on TV.  I'd rather be right there, getting a piece of the action.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yes.  I love to watch, like, baseball, softball, when I know a participant especially.
L:  So you're from Michigan?  Do you have a lot of sports on TV?
R:  No, not Michigan.  
L:  No?  
R:  Mississippi.
L:  Oh, Mississippi?  I'm sorry.  
R:  Yes.  Uh, football's a big thing here.
L:  Do you have anyone in your family that watches a lot of TV?
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah?
R:  And when we have family get togethers, all the brother in laws want to watch football.
L:  On Sundays?  [LAUGH].
R:  Yes.  And I hate it.
L:  That's how it was for me, growing up.
R:  Yes.  
L:  My brothers always watched it.  From the start to the finish and it was very boring.
R:  Right.
L:  And I think that's why I don't like watching it.  
R:  My husband doesn't watch either, but when the brother in laws come over, they take over the TV and they watch.
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH].  Not a lot of entertaining.
R:  No.  
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I'd rather sit and talk, but I don't want -- the football in the background.
L:  Yeah.  That's how I am, too.    
R:  [NOISE].  Get down.
L:  And I ha- have you done a lot of these Fisher studies?
R:  This is my third.
L:  Yeah, this is my second.  I'm looking forward to doing more.  It's --
R:  I like doing 'em.  
L:  I --
R:  I love talking to people that I don't know.
L:  I know.  Isn't it interesting?
R:  Yes.  
L:  I sp- spoke with somebody else out west the last time as well.  And how about you?
R:  Ah, last time I had just gotten into bed, about eleven o'clock, the phone rang and it was some -- I don't know where she was from, but we had a good discussion.  
L:  That's good.  It was worth being woken up, I guess, right?
R:  Yes.  
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I didn't mind at all.  
L:  Well, this softball game is very exciting and I -- I really love watching it.  Not on TV, in real life here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm watching my daughter hitting those balls.  [LAUGH].
R:  I always liked to watch my kids play.
L:  Yeah.  Did they play a lot of sports?
R:  Um, my son played football.  My daughter played softball.
L:  For a lot of years?
R:  For several years.  They're both grown now.  And --
L:  They're all grown up, huh?
R:  Yes.  Ah, my dau-
L:  Yeah, Sarah -- Sarah's up to bat, honey.
R:  Oh.
L:  Sorry about that.  [LAUGH].
R:  That's okay.  I've got one crawling all over me, too.  My little grandson.
L:  Oh, and how old is he?
R:  He's two.
L:  Oh, my son is three.  
R:  This is my grandson.  His daddy just got sent to Korea.  
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  He's in the -- he's in the army and his momma says she don't know how to care of him by herself.  
L:  Oh.
R:  And they live in Kentucky, so they sent the baby to me.  
L:  Now, is she in the service, too?
R:  No.  
L:  Oh, boy.
R:  But she's young and really I think she just wants to run around and be free.
L:  Oh, that's just -- that's too bad.
R:  Yes, it is, but I -- it's my good luck.
L:  I was gonna say --
R:  'Cause I love taking care of him.
L:  And how many -- how many do you have?  Grandchildren?
R:  Gra- grandkids, four.  
L:  Ooh.  My daughter just did a good hit.  [LAUGH].  Sorry about that.
R:  Did she?  That's okay.  Did she get a home run?
L:  No, she got to first base.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But she -- now the bases are loaded so they're --
R:  Oh, boy.  If you go --
L:  So that -- that's good.
R:  -- go wild in a minute, I'll know why. 
L:  Say that again, I'm sorry?
R:  If you go wild in a minute, I'll know why.
L:  Yes.  [LAUGH].  
R:  Tell me if you have any trouble understanding me.  I've had two strokes and I don't talk real clear.
L:  Oh, I -- I can hear you very clear.  
R:  Good.  
L:  But just I'm sorry to hear that, but I'm on my cell phone, so sometimes things get a little staticky.
R:  Yeah.  No, you're coming through real clear right now.
L:  Oh,  good.  [LAUGH].
R:  How old is your daughter that's playing?
L:  Uh, I'm sorry?
R:  How old is your daughter who's playing ball?
L:  She's eleven.
R:  Oh, boy, just the right age.
L:  She is.  She's doing great, and our oldest is fifteen and he does baseball.  
R:  Oh.
L:  So we -- we have them spread out.  [LAUGH].
R:  That's good.
L:  Our youngest is three.  
R:  My youngest just turned twenty one.
L:  Oh, wow.  And -- and that is the son of the baby you're watching?
R:  No.  This is my husband's.  It's more really my stepson.
L:  Oh, I have a stepson, too.  
R:  But he's --
L:  And he's very much into sports.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  He thinks he's gonna be on the N.B.A. team some day.
R:  Oh, really?  
L:  I tell him to keep watching, but no betting.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I -- I don't like the betting portion when sometimes it comes on the -- the sports comes on TV and people --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- just get too carried away.  
R:  You're right.
L:  [LAUGH].  Well, that's great that you're taking care of your grandson.
R:  Oh, I --
L:  I really admire grandparents who do that.
R:  I love him to --
L:  After going through --
R:  -- death.  
L:  After raising their own children and -- God bless you, really.  It's a really beautiful thing.
R:  I love doing it.  I have all four of them, if my daughter would let me.  
L:  Oh [LAUGH].  She doesn't -- she doesn't let you as much as your daughter in law?
R:  No.  
L:  Oh.  
R:  She won't let hers stay with me overnight.
L:  Oh.
R:  She thinks I can't take care of them.  
L:  Well, she probably doesn't want to burden you with -- with your health.
R:  Well, I want to be burdened. 
L:  [LAUGH].  
R:  I love my grandkids.
L:  And how old is your grandson, the one that's two?  What's his name?  
R:  Zachary.
L:  Zachary?  That's a very popular name around Massachusetts.  
R:  Yeah.  I think it is, everywhere.  
L:  Mm.  Does he like sports?
R:  He's not old enough to really know yet.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  He doesn't play anything.  He -- and he doesn't watch it on TV because we don't.  So I don't know if he would if he was around somebody that, you know, likes stuff like that.  
L:  My three year old gets very excited.  About sports.
R:  I -- yeah.  I'm planning to take him, my little nephew plays on the softball team here -- or I guess baseball, here in town, and I want to take him one night and let him watch him.  
L:  I bet you he would love it.
R:  I think so.  But lately my husband's been so busy, that he couldn't take us and I can't go by myself.
L:  Oh.  
R:  So I just have to wait till he can go too. 
L:  That sounds like a good plan.  Two years old is still a little -- little young for sports.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [LAUGH].  But it's nice to get them outside.
R:  Right.  I'm hoping he's still gonna be here with us when he -- they're gonna to have to play Kiddy League.  
L:  Now, when is your son coming home from Korea, do you know?
R:  It'll be a year from now.
L:  Oh.  Now, was he in -- in -- stationed anywhere else before?
R:  Yeah, he was stationed in uh Kentucky, Fort what?  Fort Campbell, Kentucky.  
L:  Oh, wow.  And --
R:  He's fr- he's from Illinois.  That's where he lived before he joined the army and he's been in New York and Georgia and now Kentucky.  
L:  And he -- has he been overseas before?
R:  No.  
L:  No?
R:  He's uh --
L:  First experience, huh?
R:  Yes, and he's so homesick.
L:  Oh.
R:  I talked to him just a few nights ago and I said, "How you doing?" and he said, "Not too good".
L:  Oh.
R:  I said, "Well, what's wrong?"  He said, "I'm homesick".
L:  Oh.  You'll have to make him cookies. 
R:  Yeah.  We send him big boxes every once in a while.  And --
L:  And I'm sorry, what is your first name again?  I forgot.
R:  Margaret.
L:  Margaret, that's right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay, I always like to know who I'm talking to.
R:  I can remember yours because I have a sister named Vicky.
L:  Oh, it's a small world, isn't it?  [LAUGH].  That's not a popular name.  It used to be.
R:  Yeah, it -- well, she's older than you.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  So it probably was back then.  But uh her youngest just turned sixteen.
L:  Oh, wow.
