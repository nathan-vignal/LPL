R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Because we have our own basketball team now and um --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so uh my friend, uh, is particularly crazy about the Kings.  So anyway, I watched a number of games with him and his --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- family, um, and that's how I kinda got into watching basketball.
R:  Oh.

R:  And when he left, I don't know, it just -- things just went downhill.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, that is amazing how it's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- kinda like a TV show, like if a certain --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- star in the show leaves sometimes --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sure.
L:  And it is the same thing, you know?
R:  Yeah.

L:  Yes.  And you know, there was a Jeff Gordon website there for a while.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And uh, you could get, like, a Jeff Gordon autograph and all that kind of thing --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- which I tried to get.  Well, I didn't end up getting to get it, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I tried to get it for my friend's little boy.  He was really --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- into Jeff Gordon.
R:  Oh.
L:  I haven't watched any racing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- any car racing just lately.  But --
R:  Well, there was something on TV.  There was some races on TV in Michigan this weekend and we're like, oh, he wins everything.  We don't want him to win.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  
R:  'Cause he wins.  He win -- he's so good.  But I --
L:  That's true.
R:  I forget who won, but it wasn't him.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  
R:  Somebody else won.  
L:  You did jinx him, huh?
R:  He came in -- yeah.  He came in second.
L:  [COUGH].
R:  So -- but --
L:  [COUGH].
R:  -- he was -- do you all have --
L:  Excuse me.
R:  -- race -- uh, a racetrack and stuff out there?
L:  Uh, yeah, they probably do, uh, from a long, long time ago I remember --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they had -- oh, more than -- not like the Jeff Gordon type racing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but dr- they call it drag racing, I guess.
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And uh so drag races, but I don't know if they have, like, a race -- you know, like a regular racetrack, but um, what part of um Indiana are you -- did you say it's a big place?  Is it a big --
R:  Well, we're -- we're in a small town.  We're way up --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, we're way up north, about five miles from Lake Michigan.
L:  Oh, okay.  So you're not --
R:  So we're -- we're pretty far from Indianapolis five hundred, where they have the --
L:  I see.
R:  -- races.  That's way -- that's farther south.
L:  I see.
R:  Yeah.  But we got -- you know, living in Orlando, we have Daytona five hundred.
L:  Oh, that's right.
R:  Yeah.  That's like a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- major big deal there.
L:  Well, what about football or have you guys into any --
R:  Well, of course Miami Dolphins.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  
R:  Miami Dolphins.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They --
L:  I've always liked the Miami Dolphins, too.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  I really have and --
R:  Well, Tampa Bay --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Tampa Bay as -- they've done pretty good.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
R:  I -- I like football, you know, but I still like the college.  I don't know.
L:  You like college?
R:  I like the college game.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I had a bad -- I uh -- yeah, I like college, too, if it's a college I'm either going to or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- like, I'm involved with in a personal way.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  But uh -- and -- anyway, um, huh.  Well, what -- what else can we talk about?  [LAUGH].
R:  It's -- yeah.  I'm trying to think what other sports I see on TV.
L:  Uh --
R:  Um, gymnastics.  
L:  Oh, yeah.  I love gym.
R:  Gymnastics.
L:  I love gymnastics.
R:  Yeah, that's --
L:  And I wish I were that way.
R:  I wish I could --
L:  I wish I could do it.
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  I wish I could be a gymnast.
R:  They -- they make it look very easy, don't they?
L:  Don't they?  It's just fantastic, what they're doing.
R:  Oh.
L:  Uh, well um, well anyway, I was asking you, okay, so it's really --
R:  Mm?
L:  -- cold there, so they -- they don't have ice skating, though, you know, like um --
R:  Um, they have I -- they do, in the wintertime, they have ice skating and snowmobiling.  They have a lot of snowmobile races.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, where they do that.  I -- I -- well, they do that as a sport.  They actually do it for money, too.
L:  Yeah, I guess it is a sport.  I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, I -- I have never lived in any cold country, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- type thing?
R:  Mhm.
L:  So I didn't -- don't know if they do have -- you know, if they have winter --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Obviously they have winter sports, we know skiing and all that.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Uh, but --
R:  Yeah, it's -- it's -- it's fairly new.  We're still learning.  We don't ice skate.  We know about --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- waterskiing [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- but we don't know too much about ice skating.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But that's something else that I love, is ice skating.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I really --
L:  I -- 
R:  -- like ice skating.
L:  Yes.  The teams?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, do you like the couples more or do you like just the --
R:  I like -- I like, um, the Yamaguchi girl.
L:  Oh, my God, yes.
R:  The Chinese girl.  There's a couple of them I like, but the guys, man, what's that one that's kinda bald headed?
L:  The older one?
R:  Yeah, that had cancer?
L:  Yes.  I know who you mean.  Uh --
R:  Scott Hamilton.
L:  Yes.
R:  Yes.  He --
L:  Yes.
R:  I -- I love him.  He is so -- he's amazing.  And he -- he loves --
L:  He's amazing.
R:  He lo- you can tell he loves what he does and he loves people.  I really like watching him.  
L:  Yeah.  I like him, too, and um there was uh -- you know the one, Nancy Kerrigan?
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  I don't know, is she still in -- in --
R:  I think so.  
L:  -- skating?  I thought she -- when she got married and everything and then I remember they said her -- her skating had gone way downhill --
R:  Mhm.    
L:  -- and then -- then the next time I saw her, though, she was up there.
R:  Yeah, they were doing -- there's -- I -- I don't know about now, but they were doing some thing, traveling around, uh, skating under stars or something.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  All the famous ones, you know, going around to different places and skating.  And they did it for, what was that, Disney on Ice?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah.  Did you all have that come to you?  Out there?
L:  We probably did, although I didn't go.  Uh or -- but uh --
R:  It's really --
L:  -- I'm sure that we did, at our -- our arena that they have here.
R:  Yeah, well that's --
L:  They always have Disney on Ice.
R:  Yeah.  That's another reason why I like sports on TV because it costs so much to see it in person, and even if you go to a game --
