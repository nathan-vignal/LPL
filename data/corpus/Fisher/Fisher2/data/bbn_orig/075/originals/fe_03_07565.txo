L:  Hello.  I'm Melissa.
R:  Hi.  I'm Terri.
L:  Hi, Terri.
R:  Hi.
L:  That's my mom's name, actually.
R:  Oh, okay.  I've never done this before.
L:  Neither have I.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, good.  I guess we're supposed to talk about sports?  Yay.
L:  Right, yeah.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  So what sports do you watch on TV?
R:  Um --
L:  Any?
R:  Honestly, I really don't.  Uh --
L:  You don't ever watch any, at all?
R:  Only, like, when the Olympics are on.
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  What do you like to watch?
R:  Um --
L:  Like, which events?
R:  I don't know.  Just basically um you know, like gymnastics and things like that.  I'm really not a sports person at all.
L:  Bad topic, huh?
R:  [LAUGH].  What about you?
L:  Uh, I don't watch -- I -- I like to watch, like, the Olympics.  Yeah, like figure skating, things --
R:  Yeah, that's cool.
L:  -- like that.
R:  In the -- in the winter with the luge.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I'd like to try that some day.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].  I watch a lot of hockey too, but it's off season.
R:  Do you?  My -- my daughter likes hockey, but I do- I don't.
L:  Yeah.  So um -- yeah, NHL, definitely.
R:  Yeah.
L:  My fiance watches football and uh some baseball once in a while.  It's kinda if it's on, right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, no favorite teams or anything like that.
R:  Well, depends on who I'm dating.  Occasionally I have to watch --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- that stuff too.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  So for me it's just -- the only one I actually enjoy watching is hockey.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's off season now so uh --
R:  Well, there you go.  Where are you from?
L:  I'm from uh Pennsylvania, actually.
R:  Pennsylvania?  I'm from New Hampshire.
L:  Oh, that's neat.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Not too far away.
R:  Not too far.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  This is kind of strange, 'cause they -- you know, first time they could of picked a better topic.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, I know.  Yeah.  [LAUGH].  Mm.  Let's see --
R:  So how much time do you usually -- when -- when it is hockey season, how much time do you spend?
L:  Um, well each game's about three hours long and there's a game probably every other night, or probably three -- three or four times a week, so --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- a  lot of time.
R:  So do you tape 'em if you can't watch 'em?
L:  Um, usually I'm here, if it's on, because I really, really like the Maple Leaves, which is the -- the hockey team I like, but um --
R:  That's the -- I thought the Maples Leaves were from Toronto?
L:  Yeah, they are.
R:  What are you doing, in Pennsylvania, rooting for Toronto?
L:  [LAUGH].  Oh, it's just always been my --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- my team, you know?  Yeah, so um -- yeah, when they're on I try not to miss it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And my fi- fiance likes them, too, so --
R:  Well, that's good.
L:  -- we try to watch it, but on the rare occasion that we're out, then yeah, we do -- we to -- do tape them, but it's really hard 'cause as soon as we turn on the TV --
R:  You can -- you know the score?
L:  -- the score stickers -- yeah.  
R:  That kinda messes it up, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Sometimes they'll have, like, the NHL awards and they'll have all the winners and things going across the bottom of the screen before --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they even show it.  
R:  There you go.
L:  Like, they would never do that with the Oscars or anything.
R:  [COUGH].  Of course not.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Of course not.
L:  So we usually take a piece of paper and just tape it across the bottom.
R:  Right.
L:  I guess it happens for people [inaudible] too if it's like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- uh, later at -- like, the time zones are off?  You know, so that if --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they're actually having it at three o'clock, then you know already and yeah [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  Yeah, that does happen.
L:  So, yeah.
R:  Especially if we win.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].  Yeah.  Uh --
R:  Oh, well.  Uh, ten minutes, huh?
L:  Are there any sports on that you think shouldn't be on?  [LAUGH].
R:  Ah, gee.  Pretty much all of 'em.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  
R:  I think they're just --
L:  Oh, it's --
R:  -- uh basically an excuse for men to hold onto the remote control.
L:  Yeah.  Sounds about right.
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  I -- I -- I kind of  -- I don't like watching, like, football or wrestling.  Even hockey in a lot of senses is kind of barbaric. 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Like, when I see things on -- on TV, like ping pong or golf, I just don't understand how anyone could sit and --
R:  My --
L:  -- actually watch --
R:  My parents watch --
L:  -- that whole thing.
R:  My parents watch golf by the hours.  It's --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- ridiculous.  Oh, I could fall asleep.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I just -- I um -- even like bowling, like it's -- it's fine as a --
R:  I like to play, but I don't wanna watch --
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  -- someone else do it.
L:  A spectator sport, it just doesn't cut it.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.
L:  Mm.
R:  I um -- sometimes I'll -- and I don't even know if it's categorized as a sport, but sometimes I like to watch, like -- I don't know, like the dog shows or something like that, where the --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- the breeds are competing.  I don't know if that's a sport.
L:  Mm.  Don't know if it's necessarily professional sports?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Sport, what they call --
R:  Well, they do.  They do have a --
L:  -- purely sports and --
R:  -- professional class.
L:  -- swimming so --
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah, I guess it would be.
R:  I guess.  If you're a dog lover.
L:  Yeah.  I gu- it all --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- depends, I guess.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Mm.
R:  Boy, they're gonna know we were running out of things to talk about, aren't they?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].  Do you ever watch the Super Bowl or --
R:  No.
L:  -- the World Series, something big like that?
R:  No, I really -- I never even usually know who's playing.
L:  Really?
R:  Unless -- unless I happen to be dating somebody who says --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know?  But other than that, I'm like --
L:  It's a guy thing, right?
R:  Yeah, I think so.  I think so.
L:  We used to watch it when we were kids' cause of the commercials.  'Cause they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- have the neat commercials there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But now since my fiance likes -- he doesn't usually watch -- like, the team he likes usually isn't on.  So he only really watches, like, that very last game just to see, you know, so he can talk to his buddies about it in the morning.
R:  Right.  Right.  
L:  But, uh, I make it a special day and because it's Super Bowl Sunday --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I always pick out these really nice uh, like funky looking uh plastic bowls, from like the dollar store.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  That are, like, purple with big spots on them.  And then I make these huge sundaes inside of it.  
R:  Ah, I want to come --
L:  Like, with ice cream --
R:  -- to your house.
L:  -- so it's just Super Bowl sundae.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, that's cute.  I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I am coming to your house for Super Bowl.
L:  [LAUGH] yeah.
R:  That's it.
L:  Yeah.  Try to make it light so I'm at least in the kitchen instead of watching, trying to -- following --
R:  Yeah, I just think --
L:  -- the football.
R:  -- it's an excuse to sit and eat, what, beer and chips all day or something?
L:  Yeah, that's pretty much --
R:  I don't know.
L:  -- it.  [LAUGH].
R:  I don't know.
L:  Well, it's good, anyway, whatever you do.  Well, that's pretty much it with all sports.
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  You know, guys want --
R:  -- think so.  I think so.
L:  If you like go to a sports bar, that's pretty much what they're doing, too.
R:  That's all they're doing.
L:  They wouldn't --
R:  That's al they're doing.
L:  -- notice if the game suddenly turned off or -- or the cheerleaders I guess, too.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Gotta have cheerleaders.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  And I guess why men can't watch, like, figure skating because there's no cheerleaders, even though they're there in their short skirts.  It's just something different, you know?  [LAUGH].  
R:  Well, that's true.
L:  Yeah.  Mm.  And do you know how long it's been?
R:  I have no idea.  [LAUGH].
L:  Two forty six.  Mm.  
R:  How'd you find out about this?
L:  Um, I -- at this website called Deal Hunting dot com.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  They just have all sorts of deals and someone posted it in --
R:  Yeah, someone posted it on the website that I -- that I uh -- called Freelance By You and she does a lot of freebies and -- and uh, discounts, if you do a lot of shopping online.   It's pretty cool.  
L:  Oh, I see.  Yeah, that's pretty much with the other one --
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- or with the one I go to.  It's just like coupons and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- special deals and things like that.
R:  Yeah.  That's what this is, too, and contests and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- usually you can enter and get a daily email updating you, which I usually read, like, once a week 'cause I can't read --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- them as they come through.  But --
L:  Your inbox must be full of things?
R:  Yeah.  I get a lot of emails [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  I do.
L:  Yeah.  Well, if you give your name, like, to one site, it has a tendency to --
R:  Well, basically I have --
L:  -- multiply.
R:  -- a separate email for when I enter contests.
L:  Oh, that's a really good idea.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I have an old email that I didn't use for anything else, and I was like, that's perfect 'cause then I can just go through and just basically delete everything in the box except for what -- what I want to look at.
L:  Yeah, that's a -- that's a good idea.
R:  Makes it a little easier.  It still comes through, though.
L:  Yeah.  Can't really stop --
R:  [COUGH].
L:  -- any mail.  
R:  Sports, huh?
L:  Sports, yeah.  
R:  Yeah.  Sports.  Mm.
L:  Well, what -- are there any teams, professional teams, in New Hampshire?  Can't think of anything.
R:  In New Hampshire, no.  The closest we have is Boston.
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  You know, we have the Celtics, we have the Red Sox.  Um --
L:  Bruins.
R:  Bruins.  I knew there was a hockey team.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I knew that.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Um, what's -- what's the -- what's the football team?  The -- Yankee --
L:  I'm not sure.
R:  Ah, Patriots.
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  The Patriots.
L:  Yeah, they won something a while back.
R:  Yeah, I think so.  I heard that.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Was it -- I think it was two years ago.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I just remember, because they --
R:  I think they were in the --
L:  -- were the underdogs.
R:  -- play offs this year, too, but I'm not positive.
L:  Not sure either.  [LAUGH].  I don't remember at all who was this year.  I think last year it was the uh -- uh, I'm trying to think, because there was someone's team that I know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, the Rams against the Patriots and everyone said, "Oh, the Rams are gonna win.  The Rams are gonna win", and then the Patriots won, which was nice.  
R:  Yeah.  Every once --
L:  I don't care what sport it is --
R:  -- in a while, we surprise people.
L:  -- but I like to see the underdogs win [LAUGH] a lot, you know?
R:  Yeah.  We have a really good um hockey team at -- out at UNH, the university up here.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Um, especially like the women's team.  They're kicking butt.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  The women's hockey team?
R:  My daughter -- you know, goes to games with her dad sometimes and stuff, so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I know that, you know, they're a really good team, but you know, they're only available on local public broadcasting.  You know?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  TBS.
L:  Yeah.  Or if you go to see the game, I guess.
R:  Right.
L:  I -- I went to a hockey game once in my life and it was, like, the worst time.  'Cause we actually got really, really good seats, right up front.
R:  Uh-huh?
L:  But we were right beside the bench.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And they were just uh -- it was -- like, imagine a locker room?  [LAUGH].  The smell of, like, ten grown men --
R:  Ooh.
L:  -- after they've been on the ice that long?  
R:  Oh, yummy.
L:  That's all you could smell, the whole time and that's just -- it really did, like, absorb me.  I was trying to watch the game and even my fiance, who's a man [LAUGH] you know, he -- he -- he noticed it too 'cause it's all you could smell, is this sweat and body odor.
R:  Ooh.
L:  You know, they can't help it 'cause they're out there, trying their hardest --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and everything, but ooh.  [LAUGH].
R:  That's not the best place to sit.
L:  Yeah.  So that kind of blocked the -- yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've never been to a professional sports event, though.
R:  Me either.
L:  Oh, except the baseball, actually.  [LAUGH].  Now I think about it, yeah, we used to go to the Pirates' games.
R:  Oh, have you?  The only baseball games I've ever been to, you know, the ones we play in our back yard.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, those are the fun ones, right?
R:  And I don't play, I just watch.  You know?
L:  Yeah, actually have meaning to them.
R:  Yeah, I know.  You at least know who --
