L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello.  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.  Ah, my name's Avient[?].  I'm calling from Washington, Seattle, and you?
L:  I am calling from Kansas.  My name is Rochelle.
R:  Oh, [MN] that- that's all right.  Um, how are you today?
L:  Ah, doing well.  Doing well.  It's nice here.
R:  Yeah.  I- it's -- it's very, ah, warm here, ah, too as we are not very used to very warm weather but it's very, very warm at the moment.
L:  May I ask you one other question?
R:  Sure.
L:  What is your first language?
R:  My first language is German.
L:  Oh, okay, very good.  Very good.
R:  [MN]
L:  I know just a little bit of German.  So, I was --
R:  You know [MN] --
L:  -- curious. 
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  Just a little.
R:  [MN] Just a little.  [MN] Das is gut. [MN]
L:  Das is gut.
R:  Das is gut.  Gut. 
L:  [MN]
R:  [MN] [several inaudible words] My English is -- ah, ah, my -- my English is not so good, ah, not better than, ah, ah --
L:  [MN] Your English sounds good.  I was just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- curious.  I like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to hear other languages.
R:  Oh, all right.  And, um, what do you think about the topic today?  It's, ah, interesting, isn't it?
L:  It is very interesting.  The topic of bioterrorism is.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I don't know if I have a lot to say about it but --
R:  That's --
L:  -- it is a very interesting topic. [MN]
R:  That's the s- -- that's the same thing that I thought.  I'm not, um, um, professional about it.  I am --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- not an expert and I believe there are a lot of experts but, um, it should be a difficult, ah, topic to, ah, talk about, I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I believe.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, um, I mean --
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- ah, we -- we are not, ah, ah, well informed enough to, ah --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- advise the United States how to prevent --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- or protect the [inaudible].
L:  Well, that's -- that's -- that's a thought.  There are some things that could affect everyone though.
R:  Ahah, yes.
L:  I was talking with my friend here.  I said, "What would you talk about for bioterrorism?", and she --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- brought up the smallpox vaccine --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- because there are vaccinations that could be given to the entire population --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to protect them from --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- possible attacks but then the vaccinations themselves could have bad effects too.
R:  That's right. [MN]
L:  So, would you want -- would you want to take vaccinations for that reason or would you not want to?  Ah, that would be -- you know, I would have to think about it before I would do something like that.
R:  Yeah, you don't know if it, ah, will be [several inaudible words] side effect and, as far as I know, this, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- vaccine isn't sold anywhere, um --
L:  That's true.  They're not making it readily available.
R:  Yeah, but, ah [MN] I -- I -- I heard that there's enough, ah, in stock and they can, ah, give it whenever necessary to the public and --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- but there -- there may be so much different kinds of, ah, bioterrorism and the chemicals and, ah, ah, other things, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, I mean, you can have the vaccine but later then there may be another effect.  But, ah --
L:  Well, it is a relief to me as far as bioterrorism is concerned that Iraq is not under the Hussein regime any more.  
R:  Right.
L:  That is good --
R:  Right.  That --
L:  -- because they had stuff --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- there.  They had -- I am sure there are also other countries that do --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but that was one place where we knew that it was.
R:  Right, right.  That's -- that's very good and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- as far as I know -- is -- that is a baby?
L:  Yes, my baby.
R:  Wow. [MN]
L:  She just had a birthday --
R:  Sweet.
L:  -- a week ago.  She is one year old.
R:  Oh, one year old, wow.  [MN]
L:  Ein jahr alt.
R:  Sweet.  [MN]  Sweet.  Um, I -- I -- I -- I think they will not, ah, there was not a big, ah, bioterrorist attack in, ah, the United States, yet, um, and I hope there will never be one but I believe, ah, that the States is already preventing and protecting very well --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so, that, ah -- that, ah --
L:  That is true. 
R:  Yes.
L:  I agree. 
R:  Yes.
L:  I definitely agree.
R:  Yeah, and so [MN] I actually feel safe about it.  I mean, I don't know if it is a naive, ah, thought, if -- if I am --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- wrong or maybe there is always a -- a threat but, um, I -- I -- since, ah, i- in those days where the anthrax was traveling around, yes, I was scared too but at the moment I don't know that, I don't feel it is a terrific danger --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I -- I think the, ah, very professional, [MN] experts, they already talk, um, ah -- think like that and I -- I want to believe this because -- so I feel much more safer. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, we want to believe that we're safe, sure.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  May I ask you a question?  Are you -- are you from Germany originally?
R:  Ah, I was --
L:  Wh- --
R:  -- born in Germany, raised in Istanbul and then came back, ah, to the States.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah, I'm --
L:  Okay, that's quite a combination.  
R:  [MN]
L:  May I ask you a question from your German background?
R:  Sure, sure.
L:  Um, we had, you know how the US had opposition in Europe --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to the war in Iraq?  
R:  Yes.
L:  How did you feel about that because you --
R:  Um --
L:  -- have roots back in Germany and --
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  -- I think Germany was one that was very much against what we did?  How did you feel personally?
R:  That's -- that's right.  That's, um, I can understand the German people very good and, um, there's -- it's very interesting.  You will not believe me but, ah, Germany, ah, had suffered a lot from war.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's not their own fault.  It was --
L:  That's true.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  They have.
R:  They have suffered and, ah, you will not believe me but they are really against war.  They -- they really don't want -- I mean --
L:  War -- they don't want any kind of war, do they?
R:  Yeah.  They, ah, I -- I l- -- I like German people and, um --
L:  Yes, I do too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I have been there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I --
R:  [MN]
L:  Back when it was East and West Germany, I was in West Germany.  I was a small child but I remember it.
R:  [MN]
L:  I liked it a lot.
R:  Yeah, and, um, I mean, ah, they feel -- they feel guilty about the wars and, um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they [inaudible] --
L:  You know, that -- it makes so much sense --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- in seeing how they responded to the war in Iraq because they just hate war.  You're right.  Their country was divided by it.  They suffered --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- so much.
R:  Ahah.
L:  That makes so much sense.
R:  Yes.
L:  Thank you for explaining that.  I think you're right.  I think that has a lot to do with it.
R:  Yeah, and, um, at the moment they feel, ah, ve- very much guilty about the Jewish people.  They --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- they can't say anything.  They -- if you say, you make this in the Second World War to the Jewish people, you are killers, ah, etc. then they feel really --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- guilty and they --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- that's a shame for them and, ah, since Germany's army --
L:  That is sad. 
R:  -- and m- military --
L:  That is sad, because I think the people in Germany today would -- I do not think they would do that.  I don't --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- think they would allow Hitler in again.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They -- they, you know, they would not agree with that --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- but they feel the guilt because that's the history of -- in their country.
R:  That's so right, yeah, that's so right.  It was the -- the -- the -- Hitler was insane and, ah, somehow he could control all the nation --
L:  He wanted to.  
R:  -- because -- yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And --
L:  Yeah, same thing.  I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- Hussein wanted to.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Saddam Hussein w- -- had that same aspiration.
R:  Yeah, and, ah, thank the United States, he -- ah, the United States has removed his dictators, both of them --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean, ah, the end of the Second World War comes with, ah, the participation of America too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah, that -- that's very -- they're very good that America makes, ah, in the world history --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- real peacemakers and, um, ah ... hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Ah, yeah, i- if you are still there.
L:  I'm sorry.  Hello.
R:  Yeah, i- it's okay.  And, I mean, ah, at the moment [MN] the German military is restricted, you know.  They can't have a certain number of soldiers.  They can't have, ah, more than a certain, ah, number of, ah, ah, veterans --
L:  Really?
R:  -- and, ah -- yeah.
L:  And this is still from World War two?
R:  Yes, and did you know that the biggest American, ah, ah, force, ah, army, ah, out of the United States is in Germany?
L:  Is it really?
R:  Yeah, there are -- there are, I -- I think --
L:  Well [MN] --
R:  -- like, ah, like, seventy or eighty thousand soldiers in Germany, American soldiers.
L:  And Germany does not have a choice about that?  Yes or no?  They -- they have to have them there?
R:  Ah, I am not sure about it.  But, sure, ah, they are a member of NATO and, ah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- allied with, ah, the States. [MN] I know that America is disappointed about, ah, ah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah, German.  But, you know, in -- ah, also in Britain, ah, there -- there, ninety percent of the people were against the war.  I mean --
L:  In -- in Britain?
R:  In Britain, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Actually, the people, not the government.  The government, ah, are strongly allied to the States and participated --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in the war but English people were, ah, against the war.
L:  I -- I -- I -- I got that impression too.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, but --
L:  Is it --
R:  -- ahah.
L:  [MN] Is it, do you think, maybe because the European Union is such a big thing there and -- and they want peace and they're working so hard for that?  Is that why --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- they're against it maybe?
R:  I -- I think they can't understand that, ah, for peace you have sometimes to make war.
L:  That is so true.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That is exactly what it comes down to.
R:  They -- they -- they -- they think, ah, um, some, ah, people will be killed in Iraq, ah, some of their --
L:  Sure. 
R:  -- soldiers, some of the --
L:  --Yeah.
R:  -- Iraqi people but --
L:  And it's true.
R:  -- yeah.
L:  I mean, we lost men.
R:  Yeah, they only --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- think this evil point but they don't think further because, you know, do you -- you remember the days in Serbia and Bosnia, the, ah --
L:  Oh, and that was horrible.
R:  That was --
L:  That was something --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, we Americans have never seen anything like that.
R:  Yes.
L:  I know that.
R:  Yeah, that was horrible and, again, America, stopped it but, ah, Germany did- didn't stop it.  France didn't stop it.
L:  Ahah.
R:  England didn't -- couldn't stop -- they couldn't make anything against it.  It was just new to them.  It was very close.  I mean, it is -- with a car you travel five or six, ah, hours to Serbia from Germany --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and -- and, ah, hundreds of thou- --
