L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hi.  My name is Amy.
L:  Hi.  I'm Tania.
R:  How are you?
L:  Just fine.  How are you tonight?
R:  Good.  This is the first time I'm doing this so please bear with me.
L:  Oh --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- that's okay.  I -- this is, like, my third time and they've all been pretty odd questions, so ...
R:  Oh, okay --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- good. [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]
R:  Well, United States and bioterrorism, um ... I really hope we could do something about it but I'm not quite sure the technology is advanced that much.
L:  I -- I don't think aside from, you know, just bombing them before they bomb us there's much we can do about it.  You know, if they've got the weapons and they want to use them there -- there's not a lot we can do to stop it.
R:  That's true because we won't know it's here -- it's coming, until it's here and that's the real scary part.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just like with, ah, the World Trade Center, no one ever thought, ah, we would get hit on American soil --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so, I don't think bio- bioterrorism is too far behind unfortunately.
L:  And -- and there's no way to stop it just like there was no way to stop the towers --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- because th- there's no warning.  If there was warning then it wouldn't be such a threat.
R:  Right, exactly, and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the chemicals you don't know they're here and half the time [MN] I'm sure we don't even have the right instruments to even pick it up.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's like, um, the Iraqi war ten years ago go- -- men and women and still sick and ill from the bioch- -- hazards that they ran into there --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they don't know what it was.
L:  And, [MN] whenever they come, you know, it doesn't even have to be sent through the air.  It could be, you know, people bringing it here with them and we just don't know what to look for.
R:  Very true.
L:  You know, there- there's certain things they look for but what's to say they don't have something that we don't know about yet?
R:  Exactly.  I mean, they're putting guns into cell phones.  What makes them not put chemicals into a lipstick holder or something?
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's --
L:  And a lot of those, just that small amount, even in eyedropper bottles, just that small amount could kill thousands.
R:  If not millions.
L:  Yeah, a- and spread to so many more. [MN]
R:  The -- the scary part is I think once, God forbid it ever hits here in America, we'll lose millions of people.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We're a lot of people in not that big of a country.
L:  And we'll probably lose millions before they even realize what's going on.
R:  Exactly.   Like anthrax, the big anthrax scare.  They thought that, you know, was [MN] the work of a terrorist in another country when, in fact, it might be somebody from Maryland that they're thinking.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And if Americans [MN] have their own chemicals, which we know we do have, who's to say one of them won't turn, ah -- you know, anti American and kill all of us and it's here, we can't stop it.
L:  Yeah.  I th- -- I think that's our biggest threat is to people that are already here instead of the people elsewhere [MN] because there- there's so many people that think that, you know, just like this -- the war, you know, they're completely against it and everything and, um, you know, what's to say they're not going to, you know, retaliate against us even though it's their home land?
R:  Right, exactly.  Like, the guy that -- the bomber who had the -- in his sneakers.  He's an American --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and he was ready to take out a whole plane and that's just one person, ah, b- -- it's just -- it's a very scary situation.  It goes back to Vietnam with the Agent Orange.  We didn't know what -- what's happening there and we were having many, many, many men killed, so the sophistication of all the weapons and m- -- arms and, everything nowadays is beyond my scope of understanding. [MN]
L:  Yeah, and [MN] we don't even know everything that's going on because they keep so much from the public.
R:  That's very true.
L:  Because they don't want, you know, mass hysteria and stuff so we don't even know probably half of what is actually out there and actually going on.
R:  Very, very true. [MN] It's like with everybody that they're watching and that they're -- the FBI and CIA are supposedly watching, we don't even know any of these, you know, what's going on, as you say, and, ah, it's a scary situation.  Next [MN] the President wants to go into Iran and -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- Iraq, Iran, what's he -- what's he gonna do?  Take over the whole Middle East so then everybody will come after us? [MN]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Some- somebody's gonna get it and I have a feeling it's gonna be us Americans.
L:  Yeah, it's not -- it's not gonna stay away from here for too much longer.
R:  No.
L:  'Cause people'll only take so much and -- and then they start retaliating and, you know, we're [MN] -- from -- from what the media says and everything, we're ready for anything but, you know, the media's run by the Pr- -- you know, run by the government.  They're gonna tell us that.  They're -- they're gonna do whatever it takes to stop mass hysteria.  
R:  Right, they're gonna tell us what we -- they think we wanna hear.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, we, you know, when the war started we didn't even know when it started and, as you say, they tell us just what we wanna hear and, you know, with all -- even all that, ah, insecticides that they're spraying all the trees and fruits and vegetables with, that's a form of bioterrorism, meaning [MN] not that it's a terrorism but it's the biochemicals that people are putting into the air.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's why the ozone and everything is just diminishing so, that it's so much easier for more chemicals to get in quicker.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] So, I -- I don't know.  It's -- it's a scary situation.
L:  And it seems like it all boils down to money and power.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Everybody wants it.
R:  Especially the [MN] -- the people that have it want even more.
L:  Yep.
R:  They don't look out for, ah --
L:  They've got it but that ain't enough.  They want more.
R:  Right.  They don't look out for Middle America.  It's, as Bush being the blue blood --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- he just wants more and more and all the people he has serving him, so I -- it's a scary --it's -- I keep saying a- and I know I'm repeating myself, but it's a scary situation.  We'll never know until it hits us.
L:  Yep. [MN]
R:  And, ah, [MN] --
L:  Until it's too late.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, it'll be just like, ah, well, not just like, but it'll be similar to, um, Pearl Harbor, you know.  It --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [MN] and nobody's gonna know what's happening until it's done happening and it's too late and already millions of people are dying and [COUGH] there- there's gonna be nothing we can -- anybody can do about it.
R:  No, you're right, because they don't even know how to build resistance --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to half these chemicals because they don't know what their compounds are.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, ah --
L:  And -- and it could take 'em anywhere from five to twenty five years to find out.
R:  Right, and by then America's gone.  So, I -- I don't know.  It's, ah, they gotta keep on working hard, ah, if Saddam was so able to hide the weaponry so easily, whereas the CIA thought they knew exactly where to go and where he had it all hidden, we can't even find it and we're right in the country.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, how many countries are out there that we're not even in that are continuing to make all these chemicals?  So, we're -- it's not looking too good for America.  We just seem to be going in and bombing places and not doing anything else about it.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, it's, ah, we gotta do something.  I just have- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Unfortunately I haven't figured out what it is yet. [MN]
L:  [MN] I don't think anybody has.
R:  Yes, I-- I agree with you a hundred percent, because if they did I think we would of done it.
L:  And that's still kinda iffy. [MN]
R:  It's --
L:  Everybody's worried about political correctness before they'll do anything and they have to discuss it for a year before they decide to do anything [MN].
R:  Right and give everybody a chance to hide everything --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and say, "Yes, we're coming.  We don't know when but we are coming".  So, the Lord knows what, um, when the planes hit the World Trade Center, you know, if there were any chemicals there.  We don't really know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The firemen and policemen, they're all suffering from some kind of lung in- ingestion of something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, was it -- was it only the gas fumes in all of that or were there chemicals that we just don't know about?
L:  Yeah, 'cause it's hard telling what they had on those planes.
R:  Right.
L:  Or even had somebody else put in the towers.
R:  [MN]
