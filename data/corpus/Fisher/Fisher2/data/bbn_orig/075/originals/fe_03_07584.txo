L:  Hi, I'm Scott.
R:  Uh, hi, I'm May.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, the topic of the day is, it's sports on TV.  Um, I don't have a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- whole lot to [LAUGH] contribute to this conversation because I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- do not --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- routinely watch any sports on --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- TV.  How about --
L:  Uh, yeah --
R:  -- you?
L:  Yeah, I'm the -- I'm the same way.  I -- I -- well, I watch some sports.  I participated in some in high school.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, um, professionally, I -- I usually just watch -- I watch the Super Bowl.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I watch some basketball here and there, golf, just whatever I see.  Nothing -- I don't follow anything though.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Okay.  All right.  No, I don't either and I guess, the only time --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that I do watch --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- sports on TV would be, um, for the Olympics. [LIPSMACK] Uh --
L:  Okay. [NOISE]
R:  Those -- I mean, that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- interests --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- me just because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's such --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a high level of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ability --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and commitment.
L:  [NOISE] That's [NOISE] -- 
R:  Uh --
L:  Yeah, that's true. [NOISE]
R:  Er, but you know, to watch --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- er --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the basketball and +football --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- football teams on --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- television --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I have no interest. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] No, I [NOISE] -- hm, um, do you ever watch anything like [NOISE], er -- do you ever see golf or, uh, tennis?  What about tennis?
R:  Um, you know, I do kind of like to watch tennis.  That is --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- one sport that I do enjoy watching because it's so active and, um, it's easy to follow.  It's just two people and you just watch the ball.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, but I can't think of anything really beyond tennis that I would watch on TV outside of the Olympics.
L:  Uh, actually tennis is a good one.  I usually watch that, um, during Wimbledon espe- --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- -cially.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's -- that's usually [NOISE] when I'll watch it most.  I think that's what I watch the most too.
R:  Okay.
L:  I'll wa- -- yeah.
R:  And do you follow the players?
L:  Um, not during the season but just once the tournament starts --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I will.
R:  So, would you be able to talk about who, uh, who might be in the --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- Wimbledon play offs and who has been in the past?
L:  Uh, who has been in the past, actually.
R:  Okay.
L:  But not -- [LAUGH] but not, uh -- not who's going to be.  I don't follow it during the year at all, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's just a complete surprise.
R:  Right.
L:  Uh. [LAUGH]
R:  I don't either.  The only two that have really ever caught my attention are those -- those twins.
L:  The twins, yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  Um --
R:  Was their father a basketball player?  I don't --
L:  Um --
R:  -- remember but --
L:  I remember [several inaudible words] she's a some +kind -- some of kind of sports figure as well.
R:  Right.
L:  Right.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, [NOISE] let's see.  I can't even remember -- it's Selena -- [NOISE] S- Serena --
R:  Serena and Vanessa?
L:  -- Williams -- Willia- Williams?
R:  Yeah, Williams.
L:  I think --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's their names, yeah.
R:  I think so.
L:  Well, we're in the s- -- we're about -- 'bout the same level here. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  With --
R:  [LAUGH] I --
L:  -- knowledge.
R:  -- know. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Now, how about -- are you married or do you live with anybody who's a real --
L:  Uh-uh, no --
R:  -- sports freak?
L:  -- I'm a college student, uh --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I go to Penn State.
R:  Okay.
L:  I'm living in Massachusetts right now though.
R:  I see.
L:  Uh --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- where are you from?  Uh, are you from --
R:  I --
L:  -- the east coast?
R:  No, I live in Saint Paul, [NOISE] Minnesota. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, wow.  How'd you hear about the study?
R:  Well, [NOISE] I'm a teacher.  I'm an ESL teacher and I was looking through, uh, [LIPSMACK] -- an English [NOISE] teacher journal one day and in the back I saw this ad --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and it just kind of caught my eye and I thought what an interesting study because I think part of what the -- what we're being, um, [LIPSMACK] assessed on, is like speech patterns and just usage of the English language.
L:  Yeah, never mind [LAUGH], I have no clue.  I just -- I actually just saw, um, a brief ad today, you know, on a --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- on a -- on a website, so ...
R:  And you signed up for it?
L:  Yeah, I signed up and I got a call already. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, for goodness sakes.  That's amazing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I get a lot of calls to do this, um, during --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the day when I'm not home and they leave kind of a strange message that's sort of hard to figure out but --
L:  True.
R:  Well, what kind of sports did you participate in, in high school?
L:  Um, let's see.  I -- what I did -- I did a -- a lot of sports.  I did -- ran cross country and track.
R:  Okay.
L:  I played soccer.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I was actually pretty good at soccer.  I, uh, was on the All State team.
R:  Great.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] but I don't follow it professionally. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.
L:  [LAUGH] And --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- um, I also played -- I've been swimming for a few years.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Okay.
L:  Um, uh, basketball, baseball --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I played when I was younger but not during high school.
R:  Sure.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  That's most of them but you know.
R:  [LIPSMACK] All right.  What year in college are you?
L:  Uh, I'm a junior.
R:  You're a junior, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I have a daughter who's a junior in college --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- at Embry Riddle --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which is in Daytona Beach, Florida.  I don't know if you've ever heard of it?
L:  Right, right, yeah.
R:  Um, and she's not doing any sports at college but in high school she did karate.
L:  Uh, neat.  I -- I -- I actually just took karate this semester.
R:  Did you?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Did you enjoy it?
L:  Yeah, it was nice.  I -- I -- I -- I want to join a Dojo now and continue it but you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's extra time, extra money, don't know if I have that yet.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  So ... [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's the story of life, always waiting and wondering if you're --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- gonna have extra money to do those extra things. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  Hm.
L:  Yeah.  It's just wei- -- uh, er, it is weird though [NOISE] that I was in all those sports and, er, never once -- like, I -- I really just didn't care what was going on professionally.  And I'm in college now --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- I'd -- I much rather watch the college sports than the professional ones.
R:  [LIPSMACK] You know, I've heard a lot of people say that.  Why do you think that is?
L:  Um, I think -- well, my main reason for switching over, uh, [NOISE] probably was when the baseball -- when baseball went on strike, er, in --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like in the nineties.  
R:  Okay.
L:  It just -- it just -- the greed of the players, you know, the fact that they're playing for all this money and their hearts are not exactly in it.
R:  Right.
L:  As much as, like the college students who, their -- their heart is completely into it, you know.
R:  Mhm. [LIPSMACK] Yeah, so, money is a big issue, isn't it?
L:  Right.
R:  In professional sports. [SIGH] Yeah and you have -- probably have some attitudes in professional sports that you don't have in the college sports.
L:  Oh, yeah and it [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's more about the show as well.
R:  Definitely --
L:  It's l- --
R:  -- yes, it is --
L:  -- it's like --
R:  -- more.
L:  -- that with any -- any thing that's more -- uh, well, even with music and all and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, the bands that are actually put together and produced by some company.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Like pop music.
R:  Sure.
L:  The same -- the same thing.  It's, uh, more about the -- the image and the attitudes and the actual love for the, uh, thing that they're doing.
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right.  And of course, it's really all about the advertisers. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, advertising's a big thing.
R:  Yeah, it is --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- a huge thing.  It's --
L:  Right.
R:  It's like they say that their most respective and most interesting ads for the -- you know, the big professional games --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, I actually just came up, um -- I just moved to Boston, so, they have the Boston Red Sox up here.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And we were, uh -- we -- we wanted to go out to a game sometime.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  We haven't made it there.  My room mate's working at the stadium though.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  What does he do?  Sell the, um, refreshments, going up and --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- down?
L:  -- well, it's a she.  
R:  Okay.
L:  We, uh -- yeah, there's five of us.  We all -- we're all random in the apartment, so --
R:  Okay, sure.
L:  -- uh, yeah, she's, um -- yeah, I think she -- she's doing some kind of waiting.  She's -- I think she's waiting tables and preparing food.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But it's not -- it's not a confession[?].  It's, uh -- it's like she has some professional player -- she keeps like time as a professional player that reserves a room --
R:  Oh, my --
L:  -- and she --
R:  -- goodness.
L:  -- yeah, she works that room.  It was -- it's probably -- I think she said it's all past players.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, it's a pretty -- it's a pretty good job.
R:  Yeah, that sounds like kind of a cushy job, much better than walking up and down with a -- a --
L:  Right.
R:  -- tray of --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- sodas. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I always try to ask [NOISE] her about doing. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I think it would be fun.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Uh --
R:  So, the Boston Red Sox -- well, do you know what baseball team we have in Minnesota?
L:  Uh, Minnesota --
R:  [LAUGH] I'm gonna make --
L:  Um --
R:  -- you guess. [MN]
L:  Fine.  Uh, The Twins?
R:  The Twins, that's right.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I know I -- I -- I -- I know the teams, I -- I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just don't know the, uh, players that were -- what's going on, so ...
R:  Right.  No, I don't either.  Well, we must be getting pretty close to our ten minutes.
L:  I know, I'm just ... [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I, er -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I kept wondering how it's gonna -- is it gonna interrupt and --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- uh, ask, uh, and say, "Okay, it's time to stop talking now, or ..."
R:  Mhm. [LIPSMACK] Well, they'll interrupt. [COUGH]
L:  Have you done this before?
R:  Once.
L:  Oh, okay, so, it -- it just interrupts and says --
R:  [COUGH] Excuse me.
L:  -- "Time's --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- up".  Okay.
R:  Mhm. [COUGH] Excuse me, I have a tickle in my throat.
L:  Ew.
R:  Well, they could've gotten a more exciting conversation if they, um -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- would've picked two people [LAUGH] that were more interested in sports.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yes, it's probably -- ugh, well, I guess it's all -- it's all random -- randomized, isn't it?
R:  Mhm, I'm sure.
L:  I don't -- I don't remember filling anything out that said, uh -- that asked exactly what my --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- interests were or anything, so ...
R:  [LIPSMACK] No, I didn't either.  I just sent in a little card.  I don't remember what was on it but I'm sure --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- there was nothing specific about certain topics --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that you wanted to talk about. [COUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  Okay, so, you're not going to en- -- go into the field of coaching or anything like that.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh, actually, [LAUGH] I have a random question.  Do you know what time it is? [LAUGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, my little clock here says six thirteen.
L:  Okay, so, I'll be seven thirteen, I guess.  All --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- right.
R:  -- right, you should be seven thirteen.
L:  All right.  Yeah, I just didn't -- I didn't know what ti- -- I didn't know what time I signed up for.  I didn't remember if I sa- said I wanted to start at eight o'clock or seven o'clock --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but it cou- -- it looked kind of bright --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- out here for eight o'clock.
R:  [COUGH]
