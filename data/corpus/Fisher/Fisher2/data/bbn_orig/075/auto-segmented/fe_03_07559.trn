I MEAN IT STARTED IN JAPAN AND IT'S WE JUST HAVEN'T CHANGED OUR WAYS [LAUGHTER] AT ALL  (fe_03_07559-A-0014)
BUT AND THEN YOU'VE GOT THE LONG RUN  (fe_03_07559-A-0015)
TO LOOK AT AND AND CAN WE EVER GET TO A POINT WHERE WE YOU KNOW  (fe_03_07559-A-0016)
THEY'RE CULTURES WOULD BE COMPATIBLE WITH OUR CULTURE AND UM MM  (fe_03_07559-A-0017)
THAT'S THAT'S THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS IS THEY'RE  (fe_03_07559-A-0018)
THEY HAVE A MANDATE  (fe_03_07559-A-0019)
A CORE MANDATE IN THEIR CULTURE  (fe_03_07559-A-0020)
AND IT'S AIMED AT  (fe_03_07559-A-0021)
AMERICANS AND I DON'T KNOW IF WE [SIGH]  (fe_03_07559-A-0022)
PUT THEM IN A BOX OR  (fe_03_07559-A-0023)
YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH SOMEBODY THAT'S JUST NOT GONNA CHANGE THEIR MIND  (fe_03_07559-A-0024)
MAYBE RETRAINING THEM A BIT  (fe_03_07559-A-0026)
YEAH  (fe_03_07559-A-0027)
OH I WOULD HOPE NOT  (fe_03_07559-A-0028)
I THINK THE GOAL WAS SAFETY AND AND THAT'S NEEDS TO MAINTAIN WE NEED TO MAINTAIN THAT GOAL BECAUSE THEY IMPINGED ON OUR OUR TERRITORY THEY IMPINGED ON OUR WAY OF LIFE UM  (fe_03_07559-A-0029)
THAT IT  (fe_03_07559-A-0030)
SAFE YEAH WORK ON OUR BORDERS A BIT AND AND UH  (fe_03_07559-A-0031)
BUT BIOTERRORISM THAT'S THAT'S A TOUGH ONE TO CONTROL BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A NEW TECHNOLOGY  (fe_03_07559-A-0032)
I THINK WE NEED TO UM  (fe_03_07559-A-0033)
BE INVOLVED IN THE RESEARCH OF THE TECHNOLOGY  (fe_03_07559-A-0034)
AND BE THE LEADERS IN IN HOW  (fe_03_07559-A-0035)
YOU KNOW THE WEAPONS AGAINST BIOTECHNOLOGY I THINK THAT'S  (fe_03_07559-A-0036)
AN AREA THAT  (fe_03_07559-A-0037)
WE SHOULD FOCUS IN HOW TO PROTECT OURSELVES UM RESEARCH WISE HOW TO MAKE  (fe_03_07559-A-0038)
IT HARDER TO USE BIOTECHNO-  (fe_03_07559-A-0039)
YOU KNOW THOSE KINDS OF WEAPONS AGAINST OUR PEOPLE  (fe_03_07559-A-0040)
RIGHT NOW THOSE WEAPONS AREN'T VERY EFFECTIVE ANYWAY UM THE GERM WARFARE AND STUFF THE STUFF I'VE READ ON IT  (fe_03_07559-A-0041)
MOST OF WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN HAPPENS IN THE FIRST FIVE TO TEN SECONDS AND IF YOU'RE IN THE OPEN AIR  (fe_03_07559-A-0042)
YOU KNOW IT'S ONLY IN CONCENTRATED CLOSED AREAS THAT THAT KIND OF THOSE KIND OF WEAPONS ARE OF ANY EFFECT AT ALL AT THIS POINT  (fe_03_07559-A-0043)
AND SO I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY'RE AS BIG A THREAT BUT IT COULD BECOME A BIG THREAT IF THE RESEARCH IS ALLOWED TO CONTINUE AND WE'RE NOT ON TOP OF OUR GAME AND STAYING ON TOP OF THE RESEARCH AND KNOWING WHAT'S GOING ON  (fe_03_07559-A-0044)
SO  (fe_03_07559-A-0045)
YEAH  (fe_03_07559-A-0046)
YEAH AND AND WE HAVE TO KEEP IT AT A PROTECTION LEVEL BUT  (fe_03_07559-A-0047)
IN AN AGGRESSIVE MANNER I MEAN  (fe_03_07559-A-0048)
AND I THINK THE WORLD'S PRETTY WELL AWARE OF THE FACT THAT WE AREN'T GONNA LET ANYBODY PUSH US AROUND  (fe_03_07559-A-0049)
BUT I LIKE THE IDEA OF BEING  (fe_03_07559-A-0050)
WE'RE SO INDEPENDENT AND WE WE SO MUCH JUST WANT TO DO IT  (fe_03_07559-A-0052)
OUR OWN WAY  (fe_03_07559-A-0053)
AND TO HECK WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD SOMETIME AND YET WE'RE ALWAYS OUT THERE GIVING ALL THE FUNDING  (fe_03_07559-A-0054)
YOU KNOW TO THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES WHEN THEY HAVE FAMINES AND EVEN RESTORING THEM AFTER A WAR I MEAN  (fe_03_07559-A-0055)
THE MONEYS THAT WE POURED INTO PLACES LIKE JAPAN AND KOREA AND VIETNAM AFTER WARS IS JUST AMAZING  (fe_03_07559-A-0056)
FOR BEING A NATION THAT CONQUERED THEM THEY SURE BENEFIT WHEN WE [LAUGHTER] CONQUER THEM [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] AND SO YOU KNOW WE OUGHT TO USE THAT TO OUR ADVANTAGE AND AND JUST REALLY  (fe_03_07559-A-0057)
REALLY GET AS MUCH INFORMATION ON HOW FAR HAS THEIR TECHNOLOGY GONE HOW FAR HAS THEIR RESEARCH GONE WHAT EXACTLY CAN THEY DO  (fe_03_07559-A-0058)
AND MAKE IT OUR OWN YOU KNOW  (fe_03_07559-A-0059)
OH YEAH  (fe_03_07559-A-0060)
THEY'VE GOT TO KNOW THAT  (fe_03_07559-A-0061)
I'M STILL MAD AT FRANCE YOU KNOW [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_07559-A-0062)
AND AND OTHER COUNTRIES THAT YOU KNOW  (fe_03_07559-A-0063)
YOU KNOW THEY JUST DON'T HAVE A CLUE OF WHAT'S AT STAKE I DON'T THINK UM  (fe_03_07559-A-0064)
THAT COULD BE BUT IT'S GONNA BIT THEM  (fe_03_07559-A-0065)
I JUST I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE YOU KNOW AND WE HAVE TO BITE 'EM  (fe_03_07559-A-0066)
I THINK WE'VE GOT TO YOU KNOW THE WE HAVE THE POWER  (fe_03_07559-A-0067)
AND ENOUGH CONSUMER POWER THAT WE WE CAN DO BOYCOTTS WE CAN DO THINGS THAT WOULD IMPACT  (fe_03_07559-A-0068)
THEM AND AND SWAY THEIR YOU KNOW THEIR POLICY MAKING  (fe_03_07559-A-0069)
AND I THINK WE GOTTA USE THAT POWER  (fe_03_07559-A-0070)
OH YEAH YOU KNOW THERE'S SO MUCH FUNDING THAT WE DO TO SO MANY DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND IF THEY'RE GONNA SUPPLY THE COUNTRIES THAT ARE ATTACKING US WE PULL THE FUNDING  (fe_03_07559-A-0071)
I MEAN I DON'T EVEN THINK WE BAT AN EYE ON THAT ONE  (fe_03_07559-A-0072)
IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE HELPING OUT PEOPLE THAT ARE ARE ATTACKING OUR OUR COUNTRY THEN YOU'RE NOT YOU KNOW  (fe_03_07559-A-0073)
WE DON'T HAVE ANY SUPPORT FOR YOU  (fe_03_07559-A-0074)
I THINK THAT'S GOTTA BE REAL CLEAR ESPECIALLY TERRORISM BECAUSE TERRORISM IS SUCH A A COWARDLY WAY TO FIGHT ANYWAY  (fe_03_07559-A-0075)
I MEAN IF YOU HAVE ISSUES COME TO THE TABLE LET'S WORK THESE ISSUES OUT BUT TO DO IT WITH TERRORIST ATTACKS  (fe_03_07559-A-0076)
THAT'S LOWER THAN THAN A SNAKE YOU KNOW THAT CRAWLS THROUGH THE DUST  (fe_03_07559-A-0077)
AND I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD EVEN YOU KNOW  (fe_03_07559-A-0078)
WE SHOULDN'T TOLERATE IT  (fe_03_07559-A-0079)
SO  (fe_03_07559-A-0080)
I THINK FUNDING TO RESEARCH AND AND  (fe_03_07559-A-0081)
YOU KNOW KEEPING OUR KNOWLEDGE BASE UP AND THEN PULLING FUNDING FOR THOSE COUNTRIES THAT  (fe_03_07559-A-0082)
ARE GIVING TECHNOLOGY TO THESE COUNTRIES THAT ARE GONNA USE IT TO  (fe_03_07559-A-0083)
YOU KNOW FIGHT WARS FOR TERRORIST ATTACKS MM REALLY  (fe_03_07559-A-0084)
HUH  (fe_03_07559-A-0085)

THEY'LL USE IT TO THEIR ADVANTAGE AND IT'LL GET THEM YOU KNOW ACCESS TO AREAS THAT WE DON'T WANT THEM TO HAVE ACCESS TO  (fe_03_07559-A-0095)
AND IT'S A SHAME BUT FOR OUR OWN PROTECTION IF THEY'RE HERE WITHOUT DOCUMENTATION THEY SHOULDN'T BE HERE NO MATTER HOW GOOD THEY ARE THEY HAVE BROKE THE LAW  (fe_03_07559-A-0097)
AND THERE'S CONSEQUENCES WHEN YOU BREAK THE LAW IF WE WERE TO GO TO THEIR COUNTRY AND BREAK THE LAW THEY WOULDN'T BAT AN EYE ABOUT THROWING US IN A PRISON AND NOT EVEN YOU KNOW GIVING US ANY  (fe_03_07559-A-0098)

ANYBODY THAT OPPOSES OUR  (fe_03_07559-B-0017)

AND THE UNITED STATES IS ACCEPTING THIS  (fe_03_07559-B-0061)
WHICH SEEMS INSANE TO ME  (fe_03_07559-B-0062)
BECAUSE THE ONLY PEOPLE HERE WITHOUT DOCUMENTATION  (fe_03_07559-B-0063)
ARE PEOPLE THAT SHOULDN'T BE HERE  (fe_03_07559-B-0064)
