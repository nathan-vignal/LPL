HELLO  (fe_03_07506-A-0001)
HI LILY MY NAME IS JEN CAPLIN HOW ARE YOU  (fe_03_07506-A-0002)
YOU TOO  (fe_03_07506-A-0003)
SURE GO AHEAD  (fe_03_07506-A-0004)
I AGREE WITH YOU A HUNDRED PERCENT I DON'T SEE ANY POINT IN WASTING BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN ANTI TERRORIST MEASURES  (fe_03_07506-A-0005)
YOU KNOW SECURITY MEASURES AH YOU KNOW SECURITY AT THE AIRPORT AH POLICEMEN ON THE STREET IF  (fe_03_07506-A-0006)
AH SOMEONE REALLY WANTS TO ATTACK THE UNITED STATES THEY'RE GOING TO TA- ATTACK THE UNITED STATES AND I THINK THAT A MUCH BETTER COURSE OF ACTION IS TO JUST BE A LITTLE MORE AMENABLE TO OTHER PEOPLE'S IDEAS  (fe_03_07506-A-0007)
I TOTALLY AGREE I THINK THAT THE SECURITY MEASURES ARE BOTH TOO MUCH AND TOO LATE  (fe_03_07506-A-0008)
IT'S AT THE POINT WHERE LIKE YOUR ORDINARY CITIZENS FEEL HARASSED WHEN THEY GO ANYWHERE OR DO ANYTHING WHENEVER YOU SEE A COP YOU FEEL GUILTY WITHOUT EVEN HAVING DONE ANYTHING  (fe_03_07506-A-0009)
AND THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT THEY'RE NOT REALLY GOING TO CATCH ANYONE DOING ANYTHING THE WAY THEY'RE GOING ABOUT IT THE AIRPORT THING THE AIRPLANE THING IT'S BEEN DONE ALREADY  (fe_03_07506-A-0010)
I DON'T THINK THAT ANY TERRORIST WOULD BE STUPID ENOUGH TO TRY THAT AGAIN EVEN WITHOUT THESE RIDICULOUS STEPPED UP MEASURES [MN]  (fe_03_07506-A-0011)
IT WOULD NOT BE AN ORIGINAL  (fe_03_07506-A-0012)
WAY TO GO ABOUT THINGS  (fe_03_07506-A-0013)
[MN] DO YOU FEEL THREATENED BECAUSE I DON'T I DON'T WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND SAY I DON'T KNOW IF I'M GOING TO GO INTO THE CITY TODAY BECAUSE I'M AFRAID THAT THERE MIGHT BE A BIOTERRORISM ATTACK I JUST DON'T  (fe_03_07506-A-0014)
OH REALLY 'CAUSE I LIVE RIGHT OUTSIDE OF NEW YORK AND I'VE FLOWN SEVERAL TIMES SINCE SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH  (fe_03_07506-A-0015)
AND IF ANYTHING I JUST I FEEL  (fe_03_07506-A-0016)
JUST HARASSED WHEREVER I GO I'M TIRED OF TAKING OFF MY SHOES I DON'T EVEN WEAR MY SHOES IN THE AIRPORT ANY MORE I TAKE 'EM OFF IN THE CAR AND CARRY THEM 'CAUSE I'M SICK OF TAKING THEM OFF AND PUTTING THEM BACK ON  (fe_03_07506-A-0017)
MHM  (fe_03_07506-A-0018)
I HAVEN'T BEEN REALLY FOLLOWING  (fe_03_07506-A-0019)
WELL I FEEL THAT WE COULD BE A THREAT TO THEM AS WELL I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE UNITED STATES HAS THE RIGHT TO BEAR ALL OF THESE ARMS THAT NO ONE ELSE SEEMS TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO  (fe_03_07506-A-0020)
WE HAVE THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE ARSENAL IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE AND  (fe_03_07506-A-0021)
NO ONE IN THE UNITED STATES SEEMS TO BE QUESTIONING THAT  (fe_03_07506-A-0022)
I THINK IT'S JUST LIKE AN ISSUE OF FAIRNESS I MEAN THE UNITED STATES IS A FAIRLY AGGRESSIVE COUNTRY IN TERMS OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICS  (fe_03_07506-A-0023)
AND I THINK THAT A LOT OF ATTACKS THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS WAGED HAVE BEEN UNPROVOKED OR  (fe_03_07506-A-0024)
IF NOT UNPROVOKED NOT ENTIRELY WARRANTED AND YET NO ONE SEEMS TO QUESTION THE FACT THAT WE HAVE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION WE'VE USED WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION WE'RE THE ONLY  (fe_03_07506-A-0025)
COUNTRY THAT'S EVERY USED A NUCLEAR ARM IN ATTACK AGAINST ANOTHER COUNTRY [MN] AND  (fe_03_07506-A-0026)
UM IF WE CAN HAVE THEM I DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY IRAQ CAN'T I DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY KOREA CAN'T  (fe_03_07506-A-0027)
THIS IS LILY WILLIAMS  (fe_03_07506-B-0002)
OKAY NICE TO TALK WITH YOU  (fe_03_07506-B-0003)

[LIPSMACK] WELL I THINK TO PREVENT YOU KNOW THE WHOLE BIOTERRORIST ATTACK THING  (fe_03_07506-B-0005)
I THINK WE M- NEED TO JUST MAKE PEACE WITH A LOT OF THE COUNTRIES THAT HAVE PROBLEMS WITH US YOU KNOW BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY [MN] UM FOR EXAMPLE I THINK WITH KOREA THEY POSE A THREAT  (fe_03_07506-B-0006)
I THINK YOU KNOW WHATEVER THE PROBLEM IS WHICH I'M NOT REALLY SURE THE EXACT PROBLEM I THINK THAT WE SHOULD TRY SOME WAY TO RECONCILE THE PROBLEM  (fe_03_07506-B-0007)
INSTEAD OF YOU KNOW ATTACKING THEM OR YOU KNOW USING A VIOLENT MEANS THAT WOULD PROVOKE THEM  (fe_03_07506-B-0008)
I THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO YOU KNOW JUST TRY TO RECONCILE WITH THE COUNTRIES THAT POSE A THREAT WITH BIOTERRORISM WHAT DO YOU THINK  (fe_03_07506-B-0009)
RIGHT  (fe_03_07506-B-0010)
YEAH  (fe_03_07506-B-0011)
YEAH I AGREE 'CAUSE PARTICULARLY LIKE YOU MENTIONED WITH UM THE YOU KNOW AT THE AIRPORT YOU HAVE THE MEASURES THAT EVERYONE HAS TO TAKE AND SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO TAKE OFF YOUR SHOES IT'S LIKE GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE YOU KNOW  (fe_03_07506-B-0012)
PARTS OF OUR FREEDOM YOU KNOW IS IT BECOMES SACRIFICED YOU KNOW WHEN WE TAKE SUCH MEASURES LIKE  (fe_03_07506-B-0013)
OR THE MEASURES WE CONSIDER TO BE PREVENTATIVE [MN] IT'S LIKE THEY'RE ALMOST TAKING OUR FREEDOM WITH THOSE MEASURES AND LIKE YOU SAID YOU KNOW  (fe_03_07506-B-0014)
IT'S MUCH BETTER TO YOU KNOW MAKE PEACE RATHER THAN SACRIFICE A LOT OF OUR EVERYDAY FREEDOMS AND YOU KNOW MAKE EVERYONE NERVOUS AND CREATE THIS KIND OF  (fe_03_07506-B-0015)
[LIPSMACK] HYSTERIA ACROSS THE COUNTRY OF YOU KNOW WORRYING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO GET ATTACKED AND IF WE CAN DRINK COKE PRODUCTS BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY MAY HAVE ATTACKED THE COKE COMPANY OR YOU KNOW WHAT HAVE YOU [MN] IF THERE'S JUST A SENSE OF PEACE I THINK YOU KNOW  (fe_03_07506-B-0016)
THAT WOULD  (fe_03_07506-B-0017)
HELP AND THINGS WOULD BE MUCH BETTER THAN HOW THEY ARE NOW YOU KNOW  (fe_03_07506-B-0018)

THE YOU KNOW OF THE TYPICAL BLACK OR WHITE OR HISPANIC DESCENT IS KIND OF SEEN AS SUSPECT YOU KNOW [MN] AND THAT'S WHY A LOT OF HATE CRIMES ARE HAVE DERIVED YOU KNOW IT'S ALL BECAUSE WE'RE NOT REALLY HANDLING THE BIOTERRORIST  (fe_03_07506-B-0027)
