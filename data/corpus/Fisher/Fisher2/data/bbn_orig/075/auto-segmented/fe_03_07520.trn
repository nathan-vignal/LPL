MAKE THE PUBLIC MORE ALERT TO PUT OUT NOT SO MUCH THESE ORANGE ALERTS THAT THAT THEN ARE CALLED OFF BECAUSE PEOPLE DO GET IMMUNE AND THEN THEY THINK CRYING WOLF AND THEN THEY  (fe_03_07520-A-0035)
THEY LET THEIR GUARD DOWN BUT TO AH JUST ONLY SORT OF HAVE SORT OF POSTERS LIKE WE DID DURING THE WAR A SLIP OF THE LIP CAN SINK A SHIP  (fe_03_07520-A-0036)
