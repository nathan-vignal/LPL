R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi there.
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  Fine, fine.
L:  [NOISE] Good.  I'm Karema.
R:  I'm Meg.
L:  Meg, okay.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, so --
L:  [NOISE] Uh --
R:  -- we're supposed to talk about airport security.
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]
R:  Ha, ha, ha.  So, what do you think about airport security?
L:  Um, [NOISE] I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- guess my opinion with airport security [NOISE] is they probably went -- did a -- a gr- a good thing, I guess --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a lot of the airports employees now are federal.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  Uh, but I guess the training needs to be more extensive.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] And pay.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I gu- I guess it's good that they're now --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I guess, federal employees but at the same time they need to increase the salaries so people can [NOISE] feel, I guess, feel like they're -- it's worth it in the [NOISE] long run. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  My mom -- my mom actually works at -- in airports --
R:  Oh really? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, in St. Louis.
R:  Oh my.
L:  And, uh, yeah, so, I don't know.
R:  I don't know, I -- I was awfully grateful [NOISE] when they finally eliminated those three questions [NOISE] which as far as I can tell haven't done much of anything [NOISE].  You know, and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm not sure that any of the security measures they're passing -- they're doing now would [NOISE] have done anything about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the actual hijackers [NOISE].
L:  Right.
R:  Oh, Benji, I've got this seventeen month old here who wants something but I don't know what.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No, I'm not going to give you a box of tissues, dear, although I can blow some bubbles while I do my very valuable voice stuff here and --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  -- try to load my conversation full of useful words for the computer to detect --
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  -- on other people's phone.
L:  [NOISE] Okay, yeah, so --
R:  [NOISE] So --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- I don't know, I think a lot of it is -- is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- not very cost effective they [NOISE] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- make people go through a lot of hoops and [NOISE] -- and don't necessarily target what needs to be targeted and, you know, it's like the three questions everybody had ask that and wasted time --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for years and years and years and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't think anybody ever answered them --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "Well, gosh, [LAUGH] somebody gave me a bag to carry and I didn't know who it was".
L:  Right.  Or I saw a bag, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, even if you saw a bag would you really say anything, I don't know. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I guess they're doing --  I guess they're doing a better job with, uh, adding more undercover --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- undercover, uh, police officers --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or -- but it's -- it's, like, how do you really train for a [NOISE] situation like this, you know.
R:  Well, you go --
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  -- when I saw the security at LL which is --
L:  Right.
R:  -- one of the most threatened airlines and one of the [NOISE], you know, the most sensitive ones in the world [NOISE] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they have lots of armed guards standing around with -- with their machine guns ready to, uh, [LIPSMACK] take you out if you try anything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they x ray all the bags --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and they keep them out separately and, you know, you're -- you're not going to lose a bag in an Israeli airport [LAUGH].
L:  Right.
R:  It's gonna be taken away from you or it's gonna be blowed up just like all the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, bags you left behind in the London subway in the nineteen eighties --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- in the Irish trouble so [MN] -- so --
L:  I guess the -- yeah, the thing I think about too is [MN] would I risk my life for [MN] excuse me, would I risk my life for five fifty an hour, six fifty an hour?
R:  [NOISE] No.
L:  I don't know, you know.
R:  The job's not worth it. [NOISE]
L:  But --
R:  But there's also the question of the level of security in different places.  Like, we have to fly to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Roanoke, Virginia from time to time and, you know, we get the same treatment there as we get at the Boston airport [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- where they actually had several of the hijackers [LAUGH] flying out.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  You know, and Boston is much more --
L:  Wow. [NOISE]
R:  -- of a target than -- than --
L:  Right.
R:  -- Roanoke.  I mean, no offence to people living in Roanoke, Virginia but --
L:  Yeah, I understand.
R:  -- it's just not a major --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- metropolitan market here so ...
L:  [NOISE] Mhm, well I used to -- I actually went to school in -- in Maryland and -- and it always, uh [NOISE], I don't know, it always amazed me that, um, [NOISE] people could actually --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- pull over and pick me up [NOISE] and just wait -- first they could wait right there [NOISE], just pick me up right from the front --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then I could just -- and in Philadelphia where I live, you could just go in and get your bags.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, you don't need a ticket exchange, you don't need anything.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I remember flying to -- where did I fly to?  I flew to Atlanta once --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I lost the little tag for my bag --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and -- because we never need 'em in Philadelphia --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, other [NOISE] -- other cities you need to keep your tag and then someone actually checks to make sure --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you have the right bag.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, it's just -- I don't know, it's just weird.  It -- it would be nice if it could be standard --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- standardized but a lo of airports are owned by cities and --
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  -- some are independently owned.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, so --
R:  Well, I remember -- also remember flying around in India, um, e- every time we went on a flight there would be -- we'd be patted down and have a metal detector, the whole thing, every single one --
L:  Right.
R:  -- which --
L:  Wow.
R:  Well, it was a time -- we were flying around the time which was an anniversary of the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- destruction of a Hindu 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- temple by Muslims or it might have been a Muslim Mosque by Hindus, something that made people very angry and they were very nervous of it at the time so that's -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it might not be standard for the entire year round but actually I think it probably is, they're just very concerned about militants and --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- that -- that's the way it is when you get on an airplane so ...
L:  I think that, uh, we --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- need to take some of -- some of those measures here, I mean, because you just never know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But then you don't want to get into the whole idea of, uh, stereotyping and, um --
R:  Mhm [NOISE].
L:  -- you know, choosing the wrong person and it gets blown out of proportion.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But then if you don't it's like a Catch twenty two [LAUGH] you damned if you do and damned if you don't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know so ...
R:  Well, it's a question of are you wasting people's time --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, is [NOISE] -- is this actually --
L:  And money.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, it's a lot of money, it's a lot of --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Right.
R:  You know, you getting to airports two hours ahead of time for domestic [NOISE] flights, blah! [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Just what I wanna do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, is this just a plot by all the mall owners and all those stores that they have in airports to get people to spend --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- more money there, I don't know.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Why, thank you, Benji --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just what I needed a ball and two rattles.
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Yay! [NOISE] Does that make life better? [NOISE] That makes life slightly better.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Okay, have a rattle back.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, yes, shake 'em at the same time --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- shake, shake, shaka, shaka, shaka, shaka, shaka, shaka, shaka, shaka --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  He hasn't been on that many airplane, like, just a couple.  Gonna shake and I'm gonna bonk your rattle, bonk, bonk, bonk, bonk, bonk, bonk, bonk, bonk --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- thank you for this interruption in this jolly topic that we have here. [MN]
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  You're in Philadelphia, the home town of the [NOISE] lonely computer, huh?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] Lucky you.
L:  Yeah, Philadelphia.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And I [NOISE] gu- I guess it's getting better, you can't -- I know, um, in Philadelphia you cannot pull up to park at all.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  You know, you either have to go to short term parking or you go to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but now where people are going and I don't know that's [MN] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just as crazy.  They park on the side of the highway. [NOISE]
R:  Great.
L:  The highway -- yeah, coming into the airports so --
R:  Mhm, yeah, I know what you're talking about.
L:  -- tons and tons of cars --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just parked there so that, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, just waiting for the flight to come in [NOISE] so ...
R:  Least you can see the airplanes better if you're parked along side of the airport, right?  Well, no, it's Newark where they fly right over the highway.
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Yeah, that --
L:  It's like [NOISE], you know --
R:  You know, in Philadelphia --
L:  -- it's a ramp area.
R:  You've got that nice train station in the middle of the town too.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  About so --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you have options.
L:  Yeah.  They [NOISE] -- they're really starting to build an airport up here too so I guess they're, um, having to take some measures [NOISE] in the -- in terms of the infrastructure here so [NOISE] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that'll be good.
R:  [MN]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, airport security's actually a pretty boring topic.
L:  [NOISE] Right [LAUGH] [NOISE].
R:  Last time I did this thing we had to talk about health care --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and everybody has to complain about healthcare [inaudible] --
L:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.
R:  Ah, la de dah.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  People with guns, la de dah, baggage, la de dah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I hope that our --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- lonely computer -- we call it a lonely computer because it tends to call at night when it can't get a date.
L:  [NOISE] Okay.
R:  It just wants to talk [LAUGH].  Um, what else can I say about airport security?  Um --
L:  [NOISE] Um, what do you think about, like, you know, uh, having canines [NOISE] at the -- the gates --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- canines at the airport?
R:  You know what they have here at Logan when you get off, the USPA has its eagle --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to sniff your luggage for things like fresh meat from other countries.  It's --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- so cute.  It's really, really cute. [NOISE]
L:  Wow.
R:  Um, yeah, well the idea is to make it friendly and non threatening and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they really like finding cheese and meat [LAUGH] --
L:  Wow [NOISE].
R:  -- and some fruits and things like that.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It -- it's to not threaten the -- the, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- agriculture, you know, with foot and mouth disease and things like that.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Not that we have that much in the way of agriculture in Massachusetts, but if we did --
L:  Mhm [NOISE].
R:  -- it would be nice that they would be infected --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- by foreign things.
L:  Right.  I've never -- I've never really seen canines here. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but I always thought about it, I mean, like, it's like they've gotta train 'em for so much [NOISE], you know.
R:  Well, but dogs --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like learning that sort of thing.  I mean, these are --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- oh, let me turn that on for you, Benji.  Let me turn that on before you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there you go.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] There we go.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Benji, has this little brain enhancing toy, there you go.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, [MN] yeah, I know that my son would really love to see some more --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- doggies at the airport.
L:  Mhm.
R:  He thinks that'd be a good idea.
L:  Okay.
R:  But, no I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I can't -- airports are so unpleasant already --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there's not that much more they can make -- to make 'em more unpleasant. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  You know, they're horrible places --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's like riding the bus except on a bus at least you can get out and walk somewhere --
L:  [NOISE]
R:   -- if you don't wanna be there.  In the airport you're trapped, especially after you've --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- gone through security.
L:  Now, have you been out of the country since nine eleven?
R:  We were actually out of the country during nine eleven.
L:  Oh wow!
R:  We were in -- we were in Nova Scotia --
L:  [NOISE] Oh my go- --
R:  -- we didn't hear about it for four days afterward [LAUGH].
L:  [NOISE] Oh, my goodness. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, when we came out of the -- out of the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- from the canoeing out of the park [NOISE] so ...  Yeah, it was different, it was interesting trying to figure what --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- happens in the Canadian radio which is all --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- saying things like, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- where Canadian politicians were when it happened --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- except they wouldn't say what it was because almost everybody knew at that point.
L:  Right [NOISE].
R:  And the newspapers talking about, well, uh, the -- the people --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the criminals did not come through --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Nova Scotia.  And it was, like, "Well, what did they do exactly?"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, it took a while.  And a lot of quarters since where we were the Canadian --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- phones wouldn't take credit cards.
L:  Wow.
R:  [MN] And I was trying to call my parents who live --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in New Jersey and my brother who lives in New York City in Manhattan --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so it was, uh, an interesting time [NOISE].  But no, I -- I don't have a respect --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for the Canadian phone system at this point, at least not as it is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in Nova Scotia.  Um, --
L:  I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm -- I'm actually going to Jamaica in August --
R:  Oh, what fun.
L:  -- so I'm curious to see -- huh?
