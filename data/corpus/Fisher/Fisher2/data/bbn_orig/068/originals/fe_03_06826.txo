L:  [COUGH] Hello.
R:  Hello there.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  My name's Linda.
R:  Hi, Linda, my name is Stan.
L:  Stan?  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Um, I don't know all that much about sports but I have an opinion, I guess. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  I guess that's what we're supposed to give.
R:  Correct.
L:  Do you want to s- -- do you have -- do you know a lot about sports?
R:  Um, not a whole bunch.
L:  Okay.  Well, uh, should I start off?
R:  Sure.
L:  Okay, um, my -- both children were not into sports, they were into, um, theater --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- singing, music, acting, that type of thing --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- dance and, uh, we were always getting, uh -- our funds were always being cut when the athletes were always getting new stadium floors and better basketball hoops and stuff like that and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- electronic score keeper --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- thingers, whatever they're called and, uh, it was always a kind of a pain and -- and my children used to, uh, study very hard and get good grades and then I found out that, gee, if I get a basketball scholarship I could get into college, you know, free, probably.
R:  Probably.
L:  Yeah, not -- not, you know -- not a -- not a hundred percent and, uh, I think it's still going on to this day.  Now -- now the athletes are striking for more money and more money and more money and my son and daughter are both practically starving. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's not so --
L:  My son is an actor in New York and my daughter just graduated from Emerson trying to find a job in, uh, television and video --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and my son graduated from Muhlenberg, I don't know if you've ever heard --
R:  From where?  Oh Muhlenberg?
L:  Yeah.  So, I don't know if I made myself clear --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- but that's -- it's a little strange.
L:  Is he kind of a starving actor in New York?
L:  Pardon me?
R:  Is your son kind of a starving actor in New York?
L:  Yes, yes, he -- he basically has a job t- to pay for the rent and food and clothes on his back --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- clothes on his back but, um, he -- and in fact he actually was one of the founding members of a theater company --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, and they are attempting to provide free theater in New York City and even to us if we travel to New York -- it's free for everyone, rich and poor alike.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN] So, he isn't just doing nothing, he is doing something but it-- it's -- it's, uh -- he can't strike, you know -- [LAUGH] 
R:  No.
L:  It's frustrating. [LAUGH] So, how about you?
R:  I think that, um, whether we like it or not, my opinion is that it all has to do with dollars.
L:  Yes.
R:  Uh, it's a question of supply and demand.
L:  Well, that's true, yes.
R:  If, um -- if gasoline, um, were to come on the market with no hold backs, as much in the pipeline as they can produce, I think probably, it would drop down to maybe twenty or thirty cents a gallon.
L:  I think you're correct.
R:  And I think it's the same with diamonds where the supply is, uh, very tightly held and, um, to -- the people that control it are keenly aware of pricing and I think it's like anything else, um, that -- that -- that -- that does not spoil.  If there's a whole lot of it and it does not sell at the market, they -- they drop the prices just in order to get rid of it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And if it does sell then the price will probably not only be maintained but will probably go up.  It's -- if you've ever taken different types of nutrients like pill or tablet or capsule or whatever --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- at some point you must wonder why does one particular thing cost so much more than something else?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, you can understand why something costs more than something else, certain things cost more, but that much more you start wondering.  And if you take a look at what is hot, um, generally that's the stuff that does not drop because everybody's interested in getting it, so there's a big surge.  As far as the athletes, the, um -- they train very hard, um, [LIPSMACK] they are pampered because if they are in a money sport, that sport brings money to the people that are pampering them.  It brings publicity, it brings revenue at the gate that they charge in admission, and I -- I don't think you can deny, uh, the power that a hundred thousand seats arena has, if it's able to be filled you can charge it anywhere from fifty to thirty dollars per head.  That's -- that's a huge amount of money all at once.
L:  Mhm.
R:  The, [NOISE] uh, sports people that are involved in that -- the actual athletes --
L:  You know what, there's some noise, um, on my --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- street, just a moment.  Ay yi yi. [PAUSE] [NOISE] Okay, sorry.
R:  That's okay.  Yeah, the -- the athletes are, um, in -- in a good position and, um, a- a- as far as their ability to strike, if it were a far -- if, a big if -- if it were far more perfect world and the people that controlled the purse strings were more than willing to part with what is competitive and reasonable under the circumstances, there'd probably never be a need for strikes, whether it be sports people or people that [inaudible] or what have you.  But they're probably not as willing as we would like to think that they might or could be so we open it, um -- leverage is exerted by the athletes, it seems.  If you don't pay me --
L:  I'm sorry, now an airplane is going overhead, I'm really sorry.
R:  That's all right.
L:  Could you maybe speak a teeny bit louder?
R:  Sure.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  So, they just say, "If you don't pay me what I know I'm worth, I will simply withdraw" and at that point the people with the purse strings stand to lose a very great deal of money.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, they relent.
L:  Right.  Well, I guess I'm correlating theater and sports.  Uh, my son trained, and my daughter, like cra- -- I -- I don't think people realize what a true actor goes through when -- you know, when you have a degree in drama --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, well he has a degree in drama and set design, what -- what an actor must go through -- I never believed it.  I thought they were all a little bit pampered and, you know -- and, uh, it's not so at all. [LAUGH] But, uh, uh, I'm not saying they have to train as much as an athlete does either, but in different ways.  Perhaps it's -- I ju- -- I just think it's unfortunate, um, I -- I -- I think back in the -- when, um, Greece was grand and there was great theater and -- and sports, it was perhaps more equal, I don't know.  But I -- I just, um -- I -- I guess what you're saying really is you and I and all of the people who go or don't go to these games, are really the ones calling the shots.  Is that --
R:  Um, there -- if they -- if they are not -- if they are not, um, th- they are pretty close to it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're pretty close to it.
L:  I personally can't understand, uh -- I understand why -- a- a- at first I didn't understand why sports were important at all and I -- I -- I said to some people, you know, "Educate me, why are -- what is so -- so -- big deal, I can hit a ball" you know, [LAUGH] or whatever, you know.  And sports was explained to me how it -- it's good for a child and, you know, different -- different things like that.  And, uh, so I -- I began to appreciate sports a whole lot more as I got older --
R:  What -- what -- what is your understanding of how sports came to be?
L:  How they --
