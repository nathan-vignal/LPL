R:  Hi, I'm Katie.
L:  Hi, I'm Barbara.
R:  Hi.
L:  Um, that's interesting, Katie is my daughter's name. [LAUGH] 
R:  What?
L:  I said, Katie is my daughter's name.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, there's a lot of Katie's out there.
L:  Yeah, there are.  I didn't think there would be when I [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, I think that's what everybody says. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, let's see.  This is a hard topic for me because it's a real emotional topic for me. [LAUGH] 
R:  Why is that?
L:  Um, because I feel like whether or not, ah, I agree with being [SIGH] in the Middle East, we are there now, so, um, we've probably gotta stay until things get better, and I don't know how long that's going to take.  It may be a long, long time.
R:  Yeah.  I'm confused about whether they mean Middle East, um, regarding um, Iraq, um, Afghanistan, um, those countries, the countries that we've recently invaded, or are they talking about the Israeli Palestinian conflict?
L:  Hm.  That's a good question, and in some ways I feel that there's a connection.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Partly because of proximity. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Well, I mean, there's definitely a connection and a feeling, like, Israel is really an important place for the United States government --
L:  True.
R:  -- who want to keep troops, um, but, I don't know, I mean, I -- yeah, this is a really tough topic for me --
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  -- because I have like, really strong feelings about US foreign policy and I really feel like, um, the problems -- that a lot of the problems that exist in the Middle East now are because of like, imperialistic, colonial attitude, but --
L:  Because of our involvement there?
R:  -- well, I mean, like, a long time ago.  Not -- not speaking now but like, speaking of, you know, like um, the forties and when, you know, countries were reconstructed out of um, lands that weren't, um, actually part of the same government previously --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they were under, I mean when that was the Ottoman Empire --
L:  True.
R:  -- that was -- well, part during like world war one and then like, those countries became -- which were just like, you know, governed more locally by different groups --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, or were like, under like, a central government, the Ottomans Empire, like, were constructed into these countries that really were just based on taking a land mass and drawing lines around it and saying this is a country now.
L:  Mhm.  I have a very hard time with what's going on too, because, um, I feel that the US has a totally different concept of history --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- than [LAUGH] the, ah, I guess I'll say the old countries, the Middle Eastern countries.  Um, they, I mean, a few years is -- is like minute to them --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and history is very, very important to them and I don't think that the US sees it that way, you know, it's -- everything has to be quick --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in -- in the eyes of the US government, you know, you get in, you get it done and you change things, and I -- I don't see how we can work together when we have such different concepts.
R:  Yeah.  Um, that's like one of the -- I mean, the -- the Middle -- that's like where we have our earliest recorded history from --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in ancient civilizations there for --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, longer than we can even imagine --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but um, yeah, it is very strange.  I -- I don't know, I -- I -- I don't feel like we're actually going into these countries to actually solve any problems except for the ones that really have to do with us --
L:  I agree.
R:  -- I don't think we're going into like, Iraq and being like, okay, this is really going to be like, good for the Iraqi people --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I feel like we're going in there more like, this is really going to be good for the US economy, and I think that's a little scary, and I don't think that that kind of attitude's ever going to solve any problems.
L:  I agree.
R:  It's just going to lead to new ones, and --
L:  I agree, I think -- we have a lot of learning to do. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right. [LAUGH] 
L:  And I've -- and I think, you know, we came, you know, our government [LAUGH] we -- we came from, technically from Great Britain, and from a lot of other countries --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but it started with Great Britain --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I, you know, I'm thinking why can't we look at what's come before and why don't we learn from it? [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  But 
R:  I don't know, I -- I get really frustrated. 
L:  I do too.
R:  Sometimes I get -- I feel like I should follow the news really, really closely and just keep an eye on, like, what's happening every second, because you know, our situation changes all the time --
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- with what's going on, but then other times, and I gather, it's like, you know, if you step back from it, the little tiny, tiny events that get reported on so heavily are not really that important, they're just kind of the news that the media gets caught up in and isn't actually reporting on the real issues.
L:  Do you look at news from places other than our networks?
R:  Um, I try to -- I mean, I think it's almost impossible to stay away from the main stream --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- huge network news because it's just so much a part of our culture --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and you don't even think about it, but you know, walking to the bus stop every day and reading the front page of, you know, whatever --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- newspaper is out there, and you know, if I'm on the bus there's um, well I'm from Boston, there's like, the Boston Metro, which is the free paper that ends up on all the subways --
L:  Is that where you are?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm in Seattle. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh you are?  Okay.
L:  Oh, we're far apart. Yeah.
R:  We are. [LAUGH] But in -- but in some ways [inaudible] in some respects.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um  
L:  Um 
R:  But yeah, I try to -- I don't know, it -- actually I try to look at um, in- -- independent media --
L:  Good.
R:  -- um, as much as possible, like, I definitely look at Indy media which is Seattle based --
L:  Mhm. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- um, and ah, I don't know, I -- I listen to NPR, even though, I don't know, NPR's a really confusing topic. [LAUGH]
L:  It can be biased too, we've found, and although we've found the, in our family, that if we listen to the BBC news or ITN --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- some of those, um, it's nice to get a different perspective.
R:  Right.  The BBC is -- is a good thing.  I'm glad that NPR, um, rebroadcast BBC --
L:  Yeah, I am too.
R:  Because otherwise I would have no access to it.  But I also -- I don't um, I only own -- I own TV's only to watch movies. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm. [LAUGH] 
L:  So I don't even have reception on most of the main networking news --
R:  Yeah, we don't -- we don't have cable or anything like that either.  We're -- I know [LAUGH] most people here do, but I just -- I feel like it's kind of a waste of time, so --
L:  It is.  It is.  I mean, there are some things that are interesting to watch like, I -- I do like -- like, the Discovery channel --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and science specials, 'cause that's information that I really wouldn't have delivered to me otherwise --
R:  Right.
L:  but um, because I'm -- I'm not, by any means, any sort of scientist and um [LAUGH] -- I'm only curious about that type of thing when it's convenient for me to learn about it --
R:  Right.
L:  But um, yeah, for the most part it's just you end up getting caught up in the silliest things when you have cable.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.  Are you a big computer person?  Do you get a lot of news on the internet?
L:  Ah, I use it as a tool mostly.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't use it very much for just visiting or things like that. 
R:  Right.
L:  I know my son does. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- but I don't, I use it more, you know, for um, I do mystery shopping and that type of thing --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I use it for my contacts for jobs and things like that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but as for research, um, but I'm -- I'm -- I'm not on it a lot of the time. [COUGH] Well, it sounds like we have similar views on what's going on in the Middle East, [LAUGH] so, I agree, it is -- it is very confusing.
R:  It's very frustrating, I get so -- I don't know, it just seems like there's this -- I don't know, I just totally feel like it is so much about oil and resources and I'm so confused by that because I'm like, well, I mean, even though that we shouldn't even use oil --
L:  Right.
R:  -- yet [LAUGH] we're fighting wars over it.  I'm just like, it doesn't make sense to me at all and I don't know, it just seems like all they talk about, you know, all the fundamentalists, Al Qaeda, and I -- I don't really believe that that's as much of a threat as it's made out to be.
L:  Yeah, I agree with you.  I feel like it's more about money and power.
R:  Right.  And it makes me upset to see other people have their -- their emotions played with by --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the government and the media when they're really feeling like there's a threat and people are really scared for their families and, you know, everybody just wants to do what's best for the people that they love --
L:  And I think you probably feel -- you probably feel it even more than we do, on this side of United States.
R:  Oh re- -- well yeah --
L:  I think so.  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, my father works in one of um, those Hollis[?] buildings in Boston, and so that was like
