L:  Hi, I'm Cindy.
R:  [NOISE] Hi, Cindy, I'm Sulien[?]
L:  Uh, we're talking about whether the athletes should get paid high money?
R:  Right, and also whether they have the right to strike.
L:  Right.
R:  And, um, basically, I believe that yes, athletes, uh, [NOISE] should be able to receive, um, a high salary and --
L:  I -- okay.
R:  -- and also that they have the right to strike despite their salaries. [NOISE]
L:  I think I do agree with you.  But the number one reason I think they should get such high salaries is because the work that they do they spend so much time on the road going to different places to play the sports, so I think that warrants to have such a high salary.  And I also think they have the right to strike because some of the things that they might need the only way they can get it is by striking.
R:  Definitely, although I think that, um, one of the main reasons they can command such a high salary is because of our society with the capitalist -- or fairly capitalist, uh, culture in which we live.  And we're certainly willing to give, uh, [SIGH] baseball and football players this much money in order to provide us with, um, their skills.  Uh --
L:  Right, and the entertainment of their skills.
R:  Sure.  A- actually -- I -- I don't think it has as much to do with their, um -- with the fact that they travel, although they do -- I agree with you that they've very demanding schedules and that, you know, even in a fairly brief, um, football season -- what to us seems brief, um, they have to travel a lot, they have to spend a lot of [NOISE] time preparing and --
L:  Oh definitely in the preparation --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- because it is -- it's -- it's a lot -- you know, it's a hard working type thing --
R:  It --
L:  -- rather than just sitting in an office where you kind of, like, just use your brains, sit at a computer or something like that.  It's a very --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- physical thing --
R:  And --
L:  -- and that takes a lot out of somebody, I think.
R:  I also think that regardless of what profession someone takes up or how much they're getting paid, the right to unionize and to, um, employ collective bargaining, is very important, and --
L:  I believe that also.
R:  -- an- and that's why I think that, um, they should be allowed to strike.  So, um, what --
L:  I agree with you.
R:  Sounds like we're in agreement on a lot of these things.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Do -- do you think that, uh, there are any -- well there are, uh, some groups that by federal law are not permitted to strike, such as airline controllers.  Uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and that's sort of tangential to the point, but how do you feel about that?
L:  Well, when -- when it comes to somebody like airline controllers they can really put a lot of people's lives in jeopardy --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [COUGH] if they decided to go on strike.  So, therefore I think it's okay to say no, they cannot go on strike, because you're jeopardizing a lot of people's lives.
R:  I -- I agree with you.  Um, they're in a very critical -- and it's not an entertainment position, they're in a very critical, uh, support position where --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  -- a lot of the nation's infrastructure d- depends on their actions.
L:  Exactly but with sports, you know, if a game doesn't get, pl- -- uh, get played, yeah maybe the people that, like, work at the stadiums or something like that, are going to be out of work, but they're not going to get hurt, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  If a controller went on strike, like, whoa, I mean, the planes are going to, like -- like, be in trouble.
R:  Sure.  And so, how -- how do controllers, uh, exercise their right to -- since they can't go on strike, how -- strike, how do they exercise their right to gain better working conditions?
L:  That's a good question, I don't know how they can do that.  Unless they can, like, arrange with their other, you know, controllers to, like, either arrange to take time off and make sure somebody's covering for them and, you know, just like -- that would be the only thing I could possibly think of.
R:  I think, um, one thing that they might do is stage a work slowdown, it -- it doesn't --
L:  That too.
R:  -- happen very much in this country, but I know in France there are always demonstrations, um, by civic grou- -- um -- civic, uh -- civil employees, uh, such as --
L:  Really?
R:  -- oh yeah, um, right now, actually, in France, uh, almost all of the airline and airport, uh, employees are on strike.
L:  Mm.
R:  And, um, they, uh -- it's simply shut down the transportation system --
L:  Oh, my god.
R:  -- oh a few weeks ago -- the tr- -- uh, train workers were on strike.
L:  Oh, my god.  That must be horrible?
R:  From what I've heard, it is horrible.  It's --
L:  How on earth do people get around?
R:  They don't.
L:  Oh, my god, I'm glad I don't live there.  Well, I kind of have this thing about the French right now, anyway. [LAUGH] I'm not too happy with them with --
R:  Are you?
L:  -- you know, what they did when we first went into this conflict and they wouldn't stand behind us, so -- [SIGH] you know. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, if -- if it --
L:  I mean, I was actually going to the point of -- normally I'd buy, like, a French made perfume or a French made hair thing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I wouldn't buy it.  You know, I was kind of, like, not throwing wine away but not buying the products in order --
R:  So --
L:  -- to support my beliefs on it.
R:  Right, and it sounds like the French have some pretty different perspectives on how to accomplish a lot of things, including the issue of, uh collective bargaining because i- in this country when airline controllers go on strike, uh, it was a pretty big federal deal and, uh, they were all immediately fired and replaced with people who were non unionized.
L:  Exactly, exactly, but then to -- for the French to let their whole country be, you know, terminated with that, I can't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- imagine that, that's insane, my god.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But see, the sports guys, it's a whole different -- huh, to use the word loosely, ballgame for them --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because, you know, if they go on strike nobody's going to be able -- you know, nobody's going to have to stop going where they need to go, it's just that, "Oh, wow, I can't watch the ball games today because they're on strike".
R:  Right.
L:  It's a whole different thing, it doesn't really affect people that desperately, like an air- -- you know, like a mobility -- immobility of, uh, people to move around, Jesus, that's terrible. [LAUGH] Wow.
R:  What i- -- um, I -- I agree with a lot of what you're saying.
L:  Yeah, 'cause I -- even when you think of, um -- when they had the thing where the screen actors were supposed to go on strike and then the actors were going to go on strike and all that stuff and they were, like, making TV programs ahead of time because of that problem and everything?
R:  Right.
L:  They have the right to go on strike.  Again it was entertainment.  I think if people that are involved with the entertainment industry, whether it be sports, movies, TV or whatever, if they go on strike, it's okay because they're not really affecting people.  You know, maybe it's our entertainment that's being affected but you know, "Read a book!" [LAUGH] You know --
R:  [LAUGH] Sure, ye- --
L:  -- don't watch TV. [LAUGH] Or don't watch sports but, you know, don't tell me I can't get to work because the trains aren't running or the -- you know, I can't get to another country on business because the airlines aren't running efficiently.  That's like -- that's traumatic as far as I'm concerned.
R:  I -- I agree with you, I totally agree with you, um --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  -- but it does make some very interesting special case where people who are, um, doing critical work for a country obviously -- like hospital workers or airline, um -- airport controllers.  If they can't go on strike how do -- um, how do we guarantee that they, uh, have the same privileges of collective bargaining and ultimately the -- I think the, um, critical employees like, um, nurses and so on need to have very strong, um, labor laws in place to ensure that they get consistent -- cost of living increases and --
L:  Yeah, there was something I remember about the nurses, I think a few months ago, where there a bunch of nurses that were going to go on strike at a hospital and what happened was that hospital hired a bunch of nurses, that they imported with buses, for cover --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- for those nurses that were going to go on strike.  I can't remember what -- where it was, I think it was, like, San Bernardino County in California or some place like that.  And then the nurses that were going to go on strike were complaining about that because it was going to remove the effectiveness of their strike.  'Cause I remember that happened a few months ago and, I mean, they were going to the -- to the point of they were bussing them in from somewhere else and they were going to put them up, you know, like, give them living places and it was --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- kind of like, "Well, why don't you just give the nurses, that work here, more money then we don't have to go on strike if you're going to spend all this money to import people".
R:  [LAUGH] Did it -- um, what happened as a result, did you --
L:  I never set- heard anything else on it.  It was, like, the news kind of showed it when they were going to bus these nurses in, and they bussed them in and then the other nurses went on strike, and I don't know whether they got what they wanted or not --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, 'cause I never heard anything, it was, like, the big story was, "Oh, they're bussing nurses in", but then they dropped the story, [LAUGH] and I never heard anything else about it so I don't know what the end result was of that.  But, it kind of --
R:  It's funny --
L:  -- defeated their purpose.
R:  Yeah, it does and also it underscores the point that the, um, critical employees in our country like nurses don't get all the, uh, perks and money that relatively --
L:  Plus they have the insane hours.
R:  Yeah, like football players get amazing amounts of money compared to nurses, yet --
