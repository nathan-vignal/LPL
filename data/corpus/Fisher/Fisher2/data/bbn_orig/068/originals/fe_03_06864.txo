L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Yeah, hi, my name is Brenda.
R:  And I'm Anne.
L:  Anne, okay, and I'm -- I live in, ah, middle Tennessee.  Where do you live?
R:  [LAUGH] Huntingdon, West Virginia.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I lived in middle Tennessee for many years, in, um, Nashville.  So where are you?
L:  About a hundred miles east of Nashville, just above Cookeville.
R:  Oh yeah, I know the town very well.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, what -- how do we go about our -- our procedure here, Brenda?
L:  Well, ah, I guess they're -- they're studying language and tonal in- -- inflection and all that --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so they just want us to talk and they give us -- gave us the topic --
R:  [LAUGH] So, l- -- let's start with, are you -- approximately how old are you?
L:  I'm fifty three.
R:  And I'm sixty four, so, um, so I think, ah, my feelings about -- I was in Boston when, um, at nine eleven, and the Boston airport is known to be very, um, unfriendly --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and there was a very serious, ah, story -- a couple of stories, that floated around there and one was that about a year before nine eleven, a teenage boy got on a plane by jumping a fence and just getting on a plane and got all the way to Europe before they figured it out.
L:  Oh my goodness.
R:  Then, um, the two or three days before nine eleven, meaning on Tuesday, I think it was on Saturday, the terrorists were to, a- -- apparently got into the control tower and they let them in and let them see the whole area.  So, um, those things make me more inclined toward airport security, but, you know, the fact --
L:  But do you think that what they have done now has helped?
R:  I do.  I honestly do.  I think that, um, we have been really so fortunate in America that we haven't been attacked and I think we were lax.  At the same time, you know, it's an irritation I have to go through and I never forget flying to Des Moines, Iowa, and having them take the fingernail scissors I'd just spent nine dollars for.  I mean , what am I going to do with a pair of fingernail scissors [LAUGH] you know.  I mean, you know, you're not going attack somebody with 'em --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but by and large, I think it's, ah, I think there's been a lot of, um, over reaction to nine eleven in some ways but, um, I also think we were lax.  How do you feel about it?
L:  Ah, well I tend to agree, um, I think we still have a ways to go because you keep hearing stories about, you know, pilots or -- or personnel that just walk through, or supposed personnel, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that, ah, are supposed to have clearance passes and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- then one goes through a -- the door and the next one just follows along without, ah, swiping his pass --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, you hear stories about that.
R:  You hear a lot of, you know -- right.
L:  So, it -- it's ah, it's hard to -- I know a lot of other countries have much more stringent --
R:  Much more.
L:  -- security measures --
R:  Yeah, really.  Um, have you flown much since nine eleven?
L:  No, actually just once since then, ah, from Nashville to Rowley.  My daughter lives in Rowley, and I flew there.  I didn't have any problem, she and her fam- -- her husband have three children, they flew up here, um a couple of weeks ago --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, and you know, they just, of course, had to be there early and -- to check in and --
R:  Yeah, that -- that's a pain, that's for sure.  What I think is it's much tougher in a bigger airport than a smaller one.  For instance, when you fly out of Boston, the Logan International Airport is -- it was already ranked as the -- the most unfriendly airport in America, um, very, very, very tough to get in and out of.  People are mean, [LAUGH] you know, there's nothing friendly about it, but, ah, and the security there is just a pain to get through, I mean, it's like an hour and a half early you have to come and whatever, but if you go to, um, trying to think of the name of the town, Manchester, New Hampshire, which can't be a tenth the size of the Logan International, um, you know, you go through the security, but somehow it seems to go, um, it seems to go easier.  So um, I think a lot of it is the fear and um, complication of big crowds and that sort of thing.
L:  Yeah --
R:  I have a friend who, um, works in Denver and -- and he is in security at the airport and he says there's a lot of window dressing.  That they're doing a lot in America to make pe- -- make people think they're doing more than they are.
L:  Really.
R:  When in fact, um, he thinks that it's a lot of show.  There are some towns that -- or cities that have people who are specialist in non verbal behavior and they're supposed to be able to see who has, um, um, you know, shifty eyes or whatever, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- looks uncomfortable or whatever, and um, you know, he just says, you know, nobody -- nobody really believes that the specialists they hire in non verbal communication can tell a terrorist from a non terrorist, [LAUGH] you know, or whatever.  Um, I -- I read a study once where a fellow, um -- a reporter, who was kind of tall and thin and um, kind of like the typical nerd, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, he put a gun, or it was a toy gun, but a gun, or maybe it was empty, but whatever, he got in a wheelchair and put it under his seat --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and um, they assumed he really was handicapped and they never checked and he got all the way through from first to last and switched planes and this and that and they never -- they never found the gun.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, um, I have to think it's better than -- that it -- it does more good than it does harm.  Because who in the world would want to get on a planes where we are not being vigilant?
L:  Right.
R:  You know, I mean, it's too scary and it's still alive and well.
L:  You still hear so many --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so many things that it -- it really makes -- we've been lulled into a sense of security, false sense of security --
R:  I do -- do-- do -- really believe that, and I think essentially, the terrorist saw our weak spots.  They were able to attack us with their bombs, or you know, just think --
L:  Right.
R:  -- about the zillions of dollars we put in to -- to defense and all they did was just, you know, carry box knives or whatever they're called, you know, and um, box cutters, and they did a very good job of trying to figure out where our weaknesses were.  The Japanese did the same thing in, ah, when the Japanese took over our, um, our, um, automotive industry.  They did a great job figuring out, you know, that Americans totally rely on automobiles, that we had automobiles that were not efficient, and they did a good job, only it was just economic, that's all. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  So the terrorists did a good job of market research, they figured out where our weakness was and they came in as competitors, in a way, you know, but it's um, essentially --
L:  So do you think that they will have another terrorist attack ?
R:  I think everybody believes that, you know, I think it's foolish not to, don't you?
L:  Yes, but do you think it'll be something similar or ?
R:  Oh, I don't know that.
L:  Another -- another area.
R:  I really don't know that.  I think um, whatever they can get by with. [LAUGH] And to tell you the truth, because they don't care whether they die as individuals, um, um, you know, that -- that sure puts a scary spin on it, doesn't it?
L:  It does.  I sure does.
R:  Really.  Really.  Really.
L:  So, do you fly a lot?
R:  Ah, some.  I've been, um, fortunate or unfortunate enough to, um, be involved in giving some speeches and that sort of thing and I've, you know, I've been, maybe eight or nine trips since that time.  Right after nine eleven, um, maybe two weeks later, I had to go somewhere, I can't remember where, and um, I thought I'd going to be all American and I -- I flew American Airlines [LAUGH] and the -- the stewardess and everybody, the, you know, the flight attendants were so rude, I said that's the la -- last time I'm going to try to prove I'm all American --
L:  Goodness.
R:  -- oh, they were so rude and I said, you know, I just wish I'd flown my regular airlines with my frequent flyer miles because um, it was like, you really would think they would put them through a special, special training after that --
L:  Well, I would think so.
R: -- yeah, but they didn't -- they were really rude, and I can't remember where I was, but um, the train -- the plane came in late and I lost my connecting flight and I'm standing in the middle of an airport
