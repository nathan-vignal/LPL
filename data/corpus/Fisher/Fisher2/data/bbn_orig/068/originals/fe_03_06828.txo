L:  [NOISE] Hello.  Hi --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- my name is Laura.
R:  Hi, I'm Carol.
L:  Hi Carol.  How are you? [NOISE] 
R:  I'm good.  How are you?
L:  Pretty good thanks.
R:  Where are you from?
L:  [NOISE] Um, I'm up here in Chicago land.  Where are you at?
R:  Uh [LIPSMACK] I'm in New York.
L:  Oh, okay. [NOISE] 
R:  So, this is the first time I've done this actually because, didn't work the last time. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh no. [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah.  So um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- cool.  [LIPSMACK] Well, this is a topic I know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- very little about. [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, I know very little about --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- it either.  I do kinda have an opinion about it [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  -- because I'm not that big of a fan of --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- you know, a whole lot of --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- sports.  Um -- as I just [NOISE] turned off on the television set, my husband --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- is -- he's watching uh um [NOISE] the -- some Indy live finals or, you know what I mean? [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  That stuff, and I've booked channel so that my toddler could watch a video.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Um, I have like, very little appreciation for it [SIGH] but, um, it seems like they are paid astronomical [NOISE] -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- f- from what I've heard.  I mean, way over the top.  You agree?
R:  Yeah.  I -- I absolutely agree --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um [SIGH] and I understand some of the arguments --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- for that.  Chief among them, it's um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it's a short career.
L:  Right.
R:  Unless they, you know unless they become stars --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and they get --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- all these um, you know advertising jobs --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- which a lot of them do --
L:  [NOISE] Right. [NOISE] 
R:  -- it's um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it's really a limited window of opportunity --
L:  [NOISE] Right. [NOISE] 
R:  -- and um, the other argument for them getting high salaries is that they generate a lot of revenue --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- for the sponsoring companies.
L:  Oh sure.  I mean, I -- I can -- I can well imagine.  I mean, the gr- the bigger the stars the more their --
R:  Yeah.  He- --
L:  -- their income seems to be phenomenal.  I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- -n, look a- like at Michael Jordan and --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- you know, um [LIPSMACK] just it -- you know, some of the high --
R:  And he's one who, I -- I have to say, I kinda see him as a hero but --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I'm not a sports --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- fan particularly.  I'm not against it -- it -- I just think it's kinda silly. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  You know, [MN] I have a boyfriend too.  I mean, he's [SIGH] you know, he's fanatical [SIGH] um, and i- it's okay.  Um, I don't think they deserve less than Hollywood actors.
L:  Yeah.  I agree.  I mean, I think what they make is like you know, way out there.  I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- how do you -- how do you put a price on twenty million?  [NOISE] You know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you start going like, "Okay, oh yeah, they definitely earn their keep or, [SIGH] you know earn the -- earn their money making twenty million versus ten million.  Ah the --"
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- numbers are just so ...
R:  Yeah.  It's unbelievable.
L:  Yeah.  It's so astronomical.
R:  You know, I make four thousand dollars this year and [LAUGH] you know?  
L:  Ye- yeah. [MN] [COUGH] 
R:  Let me have one twentieth of that twenty million okay?
L:  Exactly.
R:  I'd be real happy. [LAUGH] 
L:  Exactly, uh yeah.  I work out of the house part time.  My son's ah my full time [SIGH] job and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um it's like, yeah the money just -- it kind of floors me but these -- some of these people that, when there's so many sports --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um individuals -- I mean, when you list all of the sports and, you know, all the different groups out there and then you just think --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- in terms of ...
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I mean, maybe I'm -- maybe that'd be a really good [LAUGH] question to ask my husband some time.  "If so and so that you've never heard of but plays on a team that doesn't do really well, does that mean his contract is like millions per year or is it really [SIGH] not nearly what we would anticipate based on what it's displayed in the media.  The people that are really [NOISE] really well known?"
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's -- that's something I would -- I'd be curious about. 
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  You know what I'm saying?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because ah you know, we know -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that these -- these phenomenal um [LIPSMACK] uh people that we see in the media are making you know ten, twenty, thirty some million dollars --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and ah, even these contracts for a --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- million or two million, maybe their -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- their cohorts who are not well known are making you know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- two hundred thousand --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- which, you know, is still a --
R:  I could do with that. [LAUGH] 
L:  I could totally do with that too you know, uh --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- but um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it -- it --
R:  Like, you know I think they wanted us to talk about strikes?  I -- I didn't quite hear the instruc- --
L:  I didn't quite hear that either.  I thought it was more of uh, her um ...  All that I really heard on it was that it was the topic regarding pay but um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] um if you heard the word "strike" maybe we [MN] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- maybe we should be talking --
R:  I thought I did.
L:  -- about that.  Okay maybe ...
R:  Well, anyway there's something I can weigh in a heavy 'pinion on.
L:  Okay.
R:  Y-.  Strikes.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  You know, the poor, poor dears.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Let me get my violin. [LAUGH] 
L:  Exactly.  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] I mean, come on.  They be -- they're ah -- they're making so much money and when you think of how much [SIGH] time they're --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- working.  'Course my husband would probably be like, [LIPSMACK] "Yeah, but look at all the time they --"
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  "-- practice and they travel and ..." [SIGH] and then I'd have to say something like, "Yeah, but look at -- take a doctor.  How much time they spend --"
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  "-- in school.  They're on call all the time".  [LIPSMACK] You know?  And yeah, they make [MN] --
R:  And the best doctors make two hundred thousand and some snotty little kid makes [LAUGH] two hundred thousand you know [MN] --
L:  Yeah, hitting a ball. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, yeah exactly.  It's uh -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- doesn- -- doesn't seem quite equitable.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] I'll tell you um [COUGH] [LIPSMACK] the ah, the vendors at these ball games [MN] don't make too much money --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- either and they work their butts off.
L:  Yeah.  That's true.  That's [MN] --
R:  In all kinds of weather and all that.  You know how --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- 'bout [NOISE] sharing the wealth a little bit.
L:  Right.
R:  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  The uh, the only thing that um I can think of --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- that would come close to --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- justifying some of their -- their intake is uh, you know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- like you were talking about Michael Ja- Michael Jordan being like a hero, is the kinda --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- influence then they have on other people doing -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- things that are good for the community --
R:  Uhuh.
L:  -- and that kind of thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.  That -- then I -- then I can kinda --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- go, "Okay" you know but uh, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- nobody can --
R:  Yeah, then uh, you know, on the same [NOISE] hand you got somebody like Latrell Sprewell who you don't want your kid emulating. [SIGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Exactly.
R:  Or Mike Tyson, who I understand --
L:  Oh [SIGH] 
R:  -- committed another faux pas today.
L:  Really?  I didn't hear the news today.  What was [MN]?
R:  I didn't read it because you know, I just saw -- I have -- yeah well, you know.  [LIPSMACK] And they have a little news flash in the front and it said something 'bout he -- he mouthed off some stupid thing about rape.  I said uh, you know, "I'm not --"
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  "-- even going to read this.  I'm not going to poison my brain with it".
L:  Ah, I know.  [SIGH] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  And I've said to -- I've --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- brought up the point before --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- chatting with umpteen different people when -- when sports have come up -- it seems like we've got these people who -- particularly my husband's here -- his sport is --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- football.  I don't know about your boyfriend, but uh that's the main thing --
R:  But, uh baseball, basketball. [SIGH] 
L:  Baseball, basketball okay.  Well, his main thing is football and it's like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know that's such an -- of all of them -- that's such an aggressive -- it's not quite wrestling, no it's not hockey.  To me hockey's like, whoa out there with aggression but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [MN] it's a very aggressive sport and here [SIGH] why should we be --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- shocked that it seems like nine times out of ten it's these particular sports players that end up being charged for rape or battery or some sort of, you know, aggressive criminal act a- ...
R:  Well, baseball's had its share of that too, actually.
L:  Yeah, oh yeah.  I -- I mean there's -- there's some core connection with that.
R:  The Mets have been particularly sleazy [LAUGH] in that regard.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] [SIGH] [MN] 
L:  It's um --
R:  The way that it is. 
L:  Y- yeah it's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it's really dis- -- it's distressing to me but uh --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- um --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- th- the fact that they're -- they're paid for it [LAUGH] that well to --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- me what seems like little amount of work -- seems very off kilter. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But you know, look at -- look at the other side of the -- the, um, teeter totter scale of things.  We pay teachers who have a huge influence on our future, our children every day --
R:  Pay them dirt.
L:  Yeah.  We pay 'em crap.  So um, hm [SIGH] --
R:  [LIPSMACK] It's the most um -- it --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- it's probably the least respected profession -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and it should --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- be the most respected.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, you know there's a whole group of people down there that aren't paid nearly what they should be --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- from social workers to teachers to [SIGH] you know, ye- ...
R:  Yeah and -- and you know they go crazy when teachers strike and, you know, I can hardly blame them. [SIGH]
L:  Right.
R:  'Course, I'm a former teacher so I'm a little prejudiced but [LIPSMACK] ...
L:  [SIGH] Oh, I taught -- we have ah [MN] th- the schools around here recently, they went all on strike and one of the signs -- they were actually standing on one of the main streets and they were holding up about income --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- what they were making and as I drove by one of them -- they were having -- holding up signs saying you know, "Honk if you're for the teachers" and 'course we were all just like, "Honk" you know, all the way down the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and one of the signs that this gentleman was holding up said um, "Sixteen year teacher want to know [MN] -- please up my income to at least thirty two thousand".
R:  Oh God.
L:  I know.  I mean it's like --
R:  It's a little better in New York.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  That's terrible.
L:  Yeah.  It's -- it's really bad.
R:  That's terrible.  [SIGH] And I actually taught in Chicago briefly --
L:  Oh really?
R:  -- when I was -- I -- well I went to the University of Chicago [SIGH] when I was in graduate school and um --
L:  Oh wow, great.
R:  -- I was teaching in a neighbourhood elementary school part time --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- in this program that was funded by the local --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- universities and ah, they had nothing to work with.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Those teachers and that principal, they were just the most resourceful people I ever met.  They were amazing.  They were dedicated.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, and -- and I'm shocked to hear that they're paid that low.  That --
L:  Yeah, it's --
R:  -- is terrible. [NOISE] 
L:  -- it's really. [SIGH]  So --and that, on the scale of things -- when you think of that it just inflames you all the more to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- hear so and so hit whatever at the bat and you know, just signed a contract for ten million.  [NOISE] [SIGH] And that doesn't even count what the endorsements they get paid.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, that -- that floors me too --
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  -- because [LIPSMACK] um, that -- that's -- that's above and beyond.  But, then like you brought up with -- with movie stars and -- and that, they make [SIGH] -- that just seems --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- way too, you know? [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.  And then again you know, it moves a lot of [SIGH] Gatorade and a lot of sneakers and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- um --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
R:  -- people are being employed as a result of that kind of thing, I guess.
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  Um so, tried to say -- and I'll bet this a real different conversation between two men. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, my God yeah. [LAUGH] You nailed it.
R:  I was kind of thinking, "What if I get a guy on the --"
L:  I was thinking the same thing.
R:  "-- other end?  Like somebody who's a big sports fan.  What am I gonna say?"
L:  I know.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I -- I've only done this -- this is my f- I think my fourth.  Yeah, my fourth call.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Because I signed up like last month.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And um, oh my God.  My husband has said, "Well, if anything like sports comes on hand the phone over to me" and it came -- [MN] I almost said and then I thought, "No, it's supposed to be me" you know.
R:  I'm really glad you didn't. [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, yeah uh because -- oh yeah.  I -- I -- he -- I think even he would go, "Yeah, it -- it's a little over the top but oh ... you know you're no- [NOISE] [MN]" and he's a good sport about the fact that I'm not [MN] you know?  I can walk in a room and I flip it off and he doesn't have a fit.  I mean, some guys -- you know.  I've had other boyfriends where they go -- my God, you know, the world's gotta stop.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  All right?  I'm not going to bite on "See so and so --"
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  "-- do this" --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- kinda thing, so um [LAUGH] ...
R:  I'm picturing a bunch of guys like I'm saying [inaudible] like dog bears. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Uh-huh, uh-huh, exactly.  Yup.  So uh. [LAUGH] 
R:  Eating Polish sausage. [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.  Yup.  Oh yeah, and they'd be like, "Mm yeah, that's about right.  Ten million a year".
