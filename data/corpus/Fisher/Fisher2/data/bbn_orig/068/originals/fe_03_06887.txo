R:  Hi, I'm Deborah from California.
L:  Hi, I'm Lily from California. [LAUGH] 
R:  Hi Lily.  They gave us some topic, didn't they? [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh god, we could probably talk for hours about it. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, but, you know.  Well, I don't really think peace is ever going to be attained anywhere, so 
L:  No, I don't think so.  I was reading, um, or watching something, I think, on Discovery or the Learning Channel that this situation has been going on since the year seven hundred, when the Palestinians accused the Jews of killing, was it Muhammad or his -- one of his associates or something, and -- and of course -- to me, it's similar to the Irish and the ah --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, the Ireland, IRA --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that'll never be settled.
R:  No.  Mhm.
L:  Now, what do you think about us staying in Iraq?
R:  Oh, I hope not.  I mean, we can't be peace keepers for the whole world. [LAUGH] 
L:  No.  That's true, but we also -- and we also don't want to be warlords.
R:  No, huh-uh.
L:  I have a feeling that that too, is not going to be settled.
R:  Not for a long time.
L:  There are -- there are too many factions in Iraq itself --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that all want to -- well look at Afghanistan.  Didn't we have the same thing going on there?
R:  It -- it's -- yeah, it's so strange you know, ten years go by and it's like, you have to see who's on who's side again, you know.  I mean everything changes so quickly.
L:  [LAUGH] I know.
R:  It's ridiculous.  I know.
L:  Was- -- wasn't ah, Iraq a friend of ours when we were ah, against Ir- -- Iraq -- I mean Iraq, no, when we were -- Iraq was a friend when we were against -- see I've messed it up again. [LAUGH] 
R:  I know, and then it was, like, the Russians, I mean USSR invading Afghanistan and we were against the Ru- -- you know -- oh jeeze.
L:  Did you -- did you ever read the book, Nineteen Eighty Four?
R:  Yes, I did.  A long time ago though.
L:  What I -- what I remember most about it was the, ah, one of the leaders was making a speech about, ah, it was Eurasian[?], for example, being our common enemy, and he's going on and on and in the middle of the speech, he says, "Now you raise your allies against ampasia[?]" [LAUGH] you know, nobody noticed.
R:  Yeah.  I have to go back and reread some of those books again like Nineteen Eighty Four.  I thought about doing that, getting it from the library.  It'd be interesting.
L:  Yeah, yeah, Nineteen Eighty Four was actually quite prophetic when you think about it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I um, the -- the only real news I -- I read is my Sunday LA Times --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and of course, CNN, MSNBC --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I do get Newsweek every week.  But I -- I'm behind reading the Newsweeks.  By the time I get around to it, something else has changed. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  You say, "The only news I read is", but you sound like a very educated person.  You sound like you read a lot.  Most people don't.  Most people use the excuse that they just don't have the time, but you sound like you really do.
L:  Well, I'm retired so I have more time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, but other people, you know, that doesn't 
L:  Yeah.  Do you have anybody, ah, in service?
R:  No.
L:  Oh, thankfully --
R:  No, I have, like, people working in the government, my brother and sister in law, but no-one over there.  Do you?
L:  No, thankfully.
R:  Yeah.  I know, I don't think anyone wanted to see it happen, but 
L:  Well, I just, ah, I -- I don't know.  This Mr. Bush, I [LAUGH] -- when he showed up in that helicopter on top of the, ah, and landed on top of the anti aircraft, ah, carrier, um, I just um, and then he says, "Yeah, Cheney told me to do it". [LAUGH]
R:  Isn't it ironic that, like, we lived through Vietnam and now it's -- in a way the same thing all over again.  I mean, ho- -- how can baby boomers, you know, justify that they're just in the same sort of war.  I mean, we feel like we had to do it, but 
L:  Do you -- do you feel we were right in going there?  We haven't found any weapons of mass destruction.
R:  You know what, I don't really think it comes down to questions of right or wrong any more.  I- -- it's like -- it's like -- it's like when you're young you want to divide yourselves into the good guys and the bad guys --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but when you get older, you realize there really are no good guys and -- well, yes, there are bad guys, of course.  There's Hitler and there's -- you know.  But --
L:  You're not as passionate.
R:  It's -- nothing -- it's not black and white, you know, it's gray.
L:  Right.
R:  That's just --
L:  That -- that's true.  When you're younger, it is black and white.  There is no gray.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And we probably are wrong for going over there.  But Americans, like, have to kick butt every ten or fifteen years, it's like it's in our --
L:  Well, you know, why Iraq?  There are so many countries in Africa --
R:  Look at -- that's what I was going to say.  Look at all the civil wars that are going on in Africa, they're massacring each other --
L:  Yeah, why don't we go and help those -- yeah, help those poor people --
R:  I know --
L:  -- are we afraid of one of their diseases? [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, well there's no money in it either.  If we go help them, I mean --
L:  Ah.  You've hit the nail --
R:  I don't really believe the whole, um, oil connection thing, but still there's no, you know, no reason for us to go to Africa so we're not going to benefit any, but here we do.
L:  Well, what annoys me is I hear, I read, that Cheney's company, Haliburton, was the first company to get a contract to handle the --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- the one, um, sea- -- sea port that they had where they shipped the oil.  I -- I it just boggles the mind --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and people don't -- they get all gung ho and then of course they come up, what's his name, Luger?  One of the senators, very conservative senator, decided that -- that it was wrong, that ah --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- we're making up excuses to keep the war going.  I mean, I wonder where he's going to get all the money for this, he keeps pushing for --
R:  Doesn't that scare you?
L:  -- pushing for tax breaks --
R:  I know.
L:  -- an- -- and where does the money go?  You keep borrowing it but eventually there isn't going to be any money enough to be borrowed.
R:  No, uh-huh, and inflation, if, you know, the interest rates are down now but just wait, inflation is going to start creeping back up there again.
L:  It reminds me of the Re- -- I don't know how old you are, but it reminds you of the Reagan days.
R:  Yeah.  I'm about forty five, so I lived through it. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] I'm much older than you.
R:  I didn't always understand it, but I lived through it.
L:  Yeah, well he's using the same so called, quote, trickle down theories to pay for this war and everything else, but you know, the people --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- well they didn't vote for him, come to think of it. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that was that little Florida thing.
L:  You know, they're very strong on defense.  They want a strong army, they always have.  The Republicans I'm talking about --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when I use the word "they", you know I'm not one. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I guess we're not supposed to really discuss politics, except in connection with the Middle East.
R:  Oh, that's okay.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I've gotten really unpolitical the last few years.  I -- I don't exactly stick my head in the sand but I feel like there's nothing I can do about it, so --
L:  Well that's funny, years ago I dropped out.  I literally dr- -- I said, I don't want to hear anything --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- about Vietnam or the war.  I don't want to hear anything any more.  I'm not interested, it doesn't do me any good to get upset --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I'm trying to do that today.  But when you hear stories [LAUGH] for example, they -- they rescued Jessica --
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.
L:  -- and they, I mean, this was played out all over --
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  -- she's a hero, she's a hero, well what about the guys who rescued her?  
R:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  I think, part of that too, was because she was a woman.  I mean, not that she wasn't a hero but the rest of them were too.  You know.
L:  She didn't do anything.  She got captured the first day she was there! [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, yeah, but I think because she was a woman it became a story.
L:  Yeah, I guess so.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well.
R:  I know what you mean though.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  
L:   I ah, I started a blogger site on the internet --
R:  Oh, did you? [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, and I --
R:  Boy, you're really with it, aren't you?  I tell you, don't ever put yourself down.  You're like --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- head and shoulders better than everyone else.  Jeeze.  You put me to shame. [LAUGH] 
L:  No, no, no.  What -- well you work, I'm sure, and you have children.
R:  Yeah, but that doesn't --
L:  Mine are all grown so --
R:  That doesn't -- that's no excuse --
L:  -- and I've done all the traveling I want to do. [LAUGH] 
R:  That's no excuse.  Gee.
L:  No, if you -- you have time, you at least know what's going on.  There are a lot of people, what are you talking about?  What's -- what's -- where's Iraq?  What are we talking about?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I remember, um, when Vietnam was on, somebody was mentioned and this woman says, "What's Vietnam?  What is that?"
R:  Yeah, I find that hard to believe --
L:  What -- what did you say?
R:  I find that hard to believe that people don't, you know, sometimes I think they're just putting us on, because, jeeze.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh well.
R:  But you know one thing that kind of scares me is, like, twenty years from now you're going to ask someone, okay tell me five things that happened involving September eleventh and -- and Iraq and Iran and all, and they're going to list, like, three out of five of those things are going to be things that happened on TV.  I can't watch night time television any more, it's all these drama shows, and they're all making up all this war stuff, you know, and the police -- all the police shows they're fighting all these terrorists and stuff --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- people are going to, um, they're -- they're --
L:  Scare tactics.
R:  -- yeah.  And they're not going to be able to tell reality apart from what just happened on TV.  The TV shows, it's just --
L:  You know, it's funny you said that because when they blew up the, um, when those two guys blew up the building in Oklahoma City --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and there's that famous picture of them carrying out
