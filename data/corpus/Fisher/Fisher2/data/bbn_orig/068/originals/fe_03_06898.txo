L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  I'm Roslyn.
L:  Hi, my name is Artese.  I live here in Minnesota.
R:  Oh, I live in Florida.
L:  Oh, wonderful. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  What a contrast.
R:  Yeah.  I didn't hear the question.
L:  Ah, I think the topic was um, about the unrest in the Middle East.
R:  Oh.
L:  And what do you think, whether there'll ever be a peaceful solution, and whether the US should stay involved.
R:  No, they should not stay involved.  They shouldn't be over there.
L:  You don't think -- ?
R:  I don't think they ever should have been there in the first place. [several inaudible words] [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH] That's my opinion.
L:  Yeah, go ahead.  It just -- this -- this ah, whole research is about our own opinions.
R:  Yeah, that's my opinion.  They shouldn't have been there in the first place.  It's a bunch of malarkey.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Okay, and you know, I think if they want peace they should sit down and do it peacefully among themselves.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Mhm.  'Cause I have a brother who's there now.
L:  Okay.
R:  And he says they don't even like us Americans.
L:  Oh gosh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I guess we're just kind of becoming the international police now, everywhere, kind of policing.
R:  Well, I -- I -- you know, I was taught charity should start at home and spread abroad.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Okay, we don't even have peace here, so why should they go across the water to start doing something again now?
L:  Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And we don't even understand the -- the -- the real psyche and the lifestyle and all those things of the people who live there.  Because we -- we live here very differently than the people who live there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They want what we have but they don't want to have to give up what they have to get it.
L:  Right, right.
R:  The way I see it, and I -- I think it's wrong.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They don't, you know, they don't want to do what's right, fine, let them stay where they are.
L:  Right, right.
R:  [LAUGH] I don't see any of them running over here trying to change us.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] So they obviously think we're happy with this, you know?
L:  Exactly, exactly.
R:  Yeah, but I'm with them.  We obviously are happy with it 'cause we're not trying to change it.
L:  Right, right.  I sometimes think, you know, why are we involved, first of all?  Is there -- is there a real motive behind that?  Why are we involved?
R:  It's a political thing.  Okay?
L:  Ah --
R:  I -- I -- It's, you know, George junior was trying to do something for his father.  Okay.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And that's all it was.
L:  Who was doing something for his father?
R:  Yeah, George -- George Bush was trying to do something for his father.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, his daddy --
L:  Even the Israeli Pa- -- Palestine issue, you think so?
R:  Yeah.  They just jumped on the bandwagon.
L:  Oh gosh.
R:  It's a political mess and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and like I say, we really should not have been there.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And ah, they're saying, well they had these guns that -- this warfare, okay, fine, we got ours, so what?
L:  Mhm.
R:  They're not supposed[?] to have theirs?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] They can't protect their country?
L:  Yeah --
R:  Yeah, but only if they -- if they come and like, they, you know, they were looking for a scapegoat for the September eleventh.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Okay, we don't know who did it.
L:  Right.
R:  Okay, they -- they never actually claimed to have done it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, but, ah, they did find some of their people here.
L:  Right.
R:  Okay, so now everybody that's of Middle Eastern descent now is really getting a load.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  Whether they be good, bad, or indifferent.
L:  Right.  Gosh.
R:  It -- it's a political --
L:  And it's such a big mess.
R:  It is.
L:  Gosh, god knows when are we really going to come out of it?
R:  I don't know.  I wonder.
L:  [LAUGH] Probably never.  Or a few more centuries and then, you know, we'll -- we'll talk about it as history and how the annuls of history, the mistakes we made.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, just like probably when Vietnam was going on, everybody thought it was the right thing to do until we had to pull out and then we realized what a big, big --
R:  Oh, that was a mess too. [LAUGH] 
L:  I guess when -- when we are into it we don't realize because he keeps convincing us, the leaders.
R:  Yeah, we need to realize that we can't go running everybody's country.
L:  Right, right.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Just run your own house, right?
R:  Yeah.  If you get your own house clean then you can deal with somebody else's.  I mean --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- if these people want to do this and this is the way they want to go --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- let 'em go.
L:  Yeah, it's their choice.  As long as they don't harm us.
R:  Mm.  Yeah.  And it may be wrong, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I may be wrong for even thinking that, but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- this is still America.  I can still say it. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh yes.  We have our own opinions, definitely.  I agree with that.
R:  [LAUGH] We still can say, you know, no, it was wrong but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  It happened.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It happened, you know.
L:  Exactly. [LAUGH] 
R:  Hopefully, you know, we can -- they can hurry up and get out the innocent people from over there before any more of them die.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, they came out -- somebody was saying, well, they're talking about we need just to keep them over there, and I'm no, I think we need to get them out of there.  Let them kill each other if that's what they want to do.
L:  [LAUGH] Right, right, right.
R:  I guess it's nature's way of cleansing the earth of the unwanted. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  When it gets too full.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Even though I know I probably would feel, if I was in their shoes, I probably would feel different.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Okay.
L:  Right, right.
R:  But, then -- you know, hey, that's life.
L:  That's right, that's right.
R:  That's life, and you keep on going.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They probably think the same thing about me.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know.
L:  They do, probably they do.  You're right.  They do try to emulate and they want to have the same -- it's kind of a, what do you call it?  Um, it's an image that people are trying to build for themselves.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's just -- oh gosh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it -- it's not even safe to talk about these things.  I'm so glad that there's a channel that we can discuss about it.  When you talk about it generally with anybody people want to keep their lips shut because it's scary to even voice an opinion sometimes.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  Because people get agitated, oh my gosh, and then [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, be careful who you talk to.
L:  Right.  So this is a good channel, I really like this [inaudible] study.
R:  Yeah.  I hope it -- it -- it comes -- comes out with something.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Something positive, anyway.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So okay, we talked and this is what came up. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, Americans are getting the way they're afraid to talk nowadays.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it's really true, you are.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You don't know who to talk to 'cause you don't know who's listening.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Go away.
L:  Right.
R:  You don't know who's talking.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But my -- you know, I was like, no I don't -- my husband said we should have been there, and I'm like, no, you know.
L:  No, I don't think that's right.
R:  What do we -- what do we have to be there for?
L:  Yeah.
R:  We have our own house that needs to be cleaned.
L:  Right.  We have our own dirty laundry.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We need to clean it up first.
R:  I mean, he could -- he could have stayed here and cleaned up some of the political garbage that's going around here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Why go to somebody else's house?
L:  Right, right.
R:  You know, he's been over there, you know, [several inaudible words]
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and he knows how long he has -- he was going.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] so now they got all his money --
L:  Right, right.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You're right, you're right.
R:  They got all his money and he's on the run, supposedly.
L:  Yeah.  God knows where he is too.  And then you know, he didn't find the -- the thing that we went in there for.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Not as yet, at least.
R:  I don't know.
L:  One of the things that we were going in for was weapons.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And we didn't find those.
R:  Yeah, they found them.
L:  Oh, they did?
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  When did they find them?
R:  Along with all his money. [LAUGH] 
L:  When did they find them?
R:  When did they find them?  Ah, well they found the hangars, or something, I think it was they found.  They found his hangars where -- where they had been making -- where they had been making them.
L:  Uh-huh.  Really. [several inaudible words]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah, but I've not heard about that.
R:  Oh yeah, they have found them.  They got the head chemist.
L:  Yeah, but they haven't found anything concrete.
R:  Oh --
L:  Not something really concrete.
R:  Yeah, they did.  They found -- they did find something concrete.
L:  Oh, they did?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh okay.
R:  I forgot when, like I -- I'd -- you know, after the initial first days, you know, I just got over -- quit looking at it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH] Tried to distance myself from it as much as possible.
L:  Right, right.
R:  You know.  Only if it was something real good that was coming up then I've already listened.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I -- I'm wondering when they're going to find the man himself.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I wonder if he's still alive.  But I -- I don't think he is.
L:  Really?  You don't think so?
R:  Mhm.  I honestly don't.
L:  Okay.
R:  He's letting them find all his money like that and he's still alive?
L:  I -- I think so, he is.  I really do.  I -- I think he's seeking some political asylum in some other country.
R:  No, I -- I -- I would, you know, wonder, you know, if all his -- everybody deserting him like they are --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, like a sinking ship. [LAUGH] You know --
L:  Yeah but what
