L:  Hi --
R:  Hi.  I'm Maureen.
L:  Hi.  This is Sharon from Maryland.
R:  Hi, Sharon.  How are you doin'?
L:  Okay.  How are you?
R:  I'm good, thank you.
L:  [COUGH] Where are you at?
R:  In Iowa -- Davenport, Iowa.
L:  In Iowa?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Very good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, how did you find out about this?
R:  From RMC.
L:  Very good.
R:  Ah -- are you also?
L:  Okay, I finally got an RMC person.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I've been looking for --
R:  That's awesome. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah um.  And thank you to Jeanette who --
R:  I know exactly. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- hooked us up with this.
R:  Exactly.
L:  But -- anyway.
R:  Well, what's your view?
L:  What is today's topic?
R:  Today's topic is --
L:  Huh?  [NOISE] 
R:  -- how do you feel about athletes and the salaries that they're -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  getting?  If -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- they're paid too much or --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- ah --
L:  I definitely think they're overpaid. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  Ach.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Me too. [MN]
L:  [NOISE] Um, I'd like to see our teachers get paid a little bit more than [NOISE] -- you know [NOISE] -- and the police and fire fighters.
R:  Oh, I agree.
L:  And these athletes who swing a bat, you know -- [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, I agree --
L:  -- [NOISE] I just think that -- [NOISE] 
R:  -- agree totally.  I --
L:  -- I think it's a little selfish on their part. 
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  They're lucky they make the millions that they do and for --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [NOISE] you know.
R:  Well, you know how -- how many of us --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- go to work every day and actually --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like what we do?  To me, they still get to play a game --
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] 
R:  -- that they enjoy --
L:  Exactly. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  -- and so -- so I, y- know -- 
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] 
R:  -- I -- I'm lucky too --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because I get to stay at home with my kids --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  -- but i- -- my husband --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- isn't.  He has to go --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to a job where he doesn't enjoy it at all --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and he hardly --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- gets paid anything.
L:  Mm, yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  So  you know, in the long --
L:  What does he do? [NOISE] 
R:  He's an en- ah -- a machinist for [inaudible] --
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  -- -neering, so -- he makes parts for John Deere.
L:  Oh.  Very good.
R:  Yeah.  But --
L:  [SIGH] [NOISE] 
R:  "-- you know -- not the most exciting job in the world.  It's not like he said -- you know -- when you grow up, "I wanna be standing at a machine making --"
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  "-- parts for John Deere for --" 
L:  [MN]
R:  "-- the rest of my life". [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Exactly.  And -- [NOISE] 
R:  'Cause every little child, I think, has a dream that, you know, they grow up to be a professional athlete or --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- look up to Michael Jordan or they look up to -- I dunno even who's playing now.
L:  [NOISE] No, I don't either.
R:  [LAUGH] I'm so out of it. [LAUGH] 
L:  That's how much I'm out -- yeah.  We're not sport people --
R:  [MN] Ah.
L:  -- either and I have no clue actually.  A friend of mine who sells Mary Kay -- she had a contest --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ah -- and then you -- if you place in a fifty dollar order you had -- you got to choose a final four team.  I'm like, "Final for who?  What?" 
R:  Yeah, I know.  Is that basketball?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Okay. [LAUGH] 
L:  Ya- that's -- that's about as far as I knew too.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So I had to go up on s- -- um -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- on line and try to figure out okay, what are the final four teams and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and how am I gonna choose --
R:  Oh, that's funny.  [MN] 
L:  --and, um, it was very difficult.  But ah 
R:  I would be in the same boat as you.  I'd say --
L:  I had no clue.
R:  -- "Well, what do I have to choose from?"  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Because [LAUGH] that would be a random pick.
L:  Well, it was random pick --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  -- and you know how I chose?
R:  How?
L:  I chose -- I chose New York because they're aggressive --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- opposed to Kansas.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I kinda figured out that -- that those two were like the top two, I thought --
R:  -kay.
L:  -- Kansas and -- and New York.  And I'm like, "New Yorker's are aggressive --"
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  "-- they're gonna win".  Kansas seemed more laid back, y- know?  They're -- you know --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- I have a -- I have a friend whose --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- originally from Nebraska.  You know, kind of your Middle West --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- people?
R:  That's right.
L:  They're nice laid back people. [LAUGH]
R:  That's right.
L:  I'm sorry, you're not gonna win 'cause you're too --
R:  [MN] [LAUGH] 
L:  -- y- know -- against these aggressive nasty New Yorkers.
R:  Oh.
L:  You know? [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, see I was --
L:  And that was in my own mind.
R:  We have -- we have, you know, like Michigan -- the source of us.  That's m- my husband's favorite school, although he didn't go there --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- but it's the team he's followed since he was, you know, in high school and so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- Michigan's a great school, but, you know -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I -- I couldn't tell you -- you know, I know that they've won before -- 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- but I -- I would be random.
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.  
R:  So 
L:  I had no i- -- no clue either so 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But that's how I'm into sports, but when I hear about, "Oh they're going on strike" well, who cares?
R:  Right.
L:  I mean --
R:  It -- doesn't it just frustrate you though?
L:  -- you know -- you're asking for how much more   Huh?
R:  Does it frustrate you?
L:  Yes, it does.
R:  It does me too.
L:  Because here our teachers, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's, uh, big in the news right now -- are getting -- y- know -- a freeze on their pay --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and all these high paid sports people are, "Well, we're -- we wa- -- we want one point two five million dollars a game".
R:  Yeah.
L:  For what, two hours worth of work?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Where our teachers are teaching our children an' 
R:  Right -- and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- shaping the minds of the future.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  And --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- oh I -- I -- I agree completely.  We've had --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  --so many problems with school cut backs in our area.
L:  [SIGH] [NOISE] 
R:  I think it's pretty much universal all over the country right now but --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  You know, I'm lucky that the district that my daughter goes to hasn't had any problems but you'd literally drive ten miles --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and that district had to close --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- two schools last year because they just didn't have the funds to --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- keep them open.
L:   Right.
R:  So it's very sad because, you know -- 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- you look at that and you go, "What a shame".  But you know that's the same thing -- I look at [MN] you know -- 
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- the situation with the war in Iraq right now and think --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- you know, we're so quick to -- to send however many billions of dollars over there to fight a war which I'm not gonna --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- you know, say whether --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or not it's just or -- because everybody falls on different sides of that but --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- but still --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- seven billion dollars.  But why can't we find the money --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- to fund our schools?
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  And then w- we won't have to have these problems.  And let's make -- you know -- teaching a worthy profession money wise.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  Not just valor but, you know, make it worth their time also.
L:  Ri- yeah.  And a lot of them -- that's what -- oh, my daughter's getting ready to go to kindergarten so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I guess I met the teacher for the first time, and she -- you know, she's like, you know, "It's a barely livable salary".
R:  Oh, definitely.
L:  And y- know, that's all they're asking for is to be able to, y- know, get an apartment --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- and -- y- know -- teachers coming out -- right out of college can't afford that.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  So it does make me very angry that, you know, these celebrities -- oh well --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- "We want a million dollars an episode".
R:  Right.
L:  I guess because you probably will never work again?  Is that the ? [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Well, you know--
L:  You know their time 
R:  -- how could [MN] -- my full thing is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I couldn't even see commanding more money like they do.
L:  No.
R:  Wouldn't -- I mean -- after I think --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I had one s- -- one year where I earned -- you know -- a couple of million dollars, I'd retire.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  I think I'd be good. [LAUGH]
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  No.  
L:  I'd be --
R:  Why do you need all that money for?
L:  Yeah.  Oh, well for your -- more sports cars so you can have five sports cars in your drive way and --
R:  -y God.
L:  -- your -- your seven million dollar house that has twenty rooms that you don't live in and I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I can't keep this little three bedroom house we have clean, you know.
R:  I -- aw.  I agree.  But see y- gotta have that much --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- money I guess to afford to have somebody to come in and clean your place.
L:  [NOISE] Ooh ah -- yeah -- mm, maybe someday.
R:  I -- I said if I ever had that much money I would have a cook and I would have a maid. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Those are two things I don't enjoy doing. [LAUGH] So I -- I feel -- I feel for --
L:  But -- uh --
R:  -- you know, the situation that they're in because they -- at the same time --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- they are, you know, the reason that everybo- -- and people are paying money to come see them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it wouldn't be fair for, you know, the person that owns the team --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- to keep all of the money.  But -- 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- why do we have to pay so much to begin with?  Let's not make it such an event that --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know -- 
L:  Like they're held up to 
R:  -- that we have to pay sixty dollars a ticket.
L:  Well, they're on some kind of pedestal or whatever that they're supposed to be [NOISE] better than the rest of us, I guess, because they --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I mean -- and -- and -- that's nice.  They do -- they have athletic ability --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and that's all -- all wonderful. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, you know, sometimes what's up inside your head --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- sometimes is what should be [NOISE] worth the money too and --
R:  Right.
L:  Um 
R:  But because in the long run, when you look at how they would benefit I guess mankind or humanity --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- it's a pretty laughable situation.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  People that -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- could, you know 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  My husband goes to school and he has a physics professor who --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- uh, does all kinds of stuff that I would never understand in a million years -- don't even care to go there but --
L:  [MN] Yeah. [MN] 
R:  -- he -- y- know --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- he is brilliant -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- but has no place really to go for --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, that would be worth his time money wise --
L:  [NOISE] Mm.
R:  -- to go and do these things.  And I just think that's a -- that's a waste too --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- even though it's -- he's teaching and that's a great thing and it's nice that -- you know --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  -- my husband can learn from such a smart guy but at the same time -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- my gosh, let's -- we -- we just have --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- lost that focus, I think, of what's --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- important in this country.
L:  [MN] I think -- I think you've hit it on the head.  What is important y- you said are teachers or police or fire fighters --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or -- you know.
R:  Right.
L:  Those are the people that are -- and, you know, even the military, y- know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  A lot of these families you see on the news too --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know are hurting because they've -- their -- you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- husbands they went overseas and they have to take a pay cut and --because -- 
R:  Yes.  It just happened with our family.
L:  Oh really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And --
R:  He was in the military for twelve years and --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  -- finally just gotten out and had taken a job with the Secret Service and they -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- called him back --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and he took a sixty thousand dollar pay cut.
L:  Mm. [NOISE] 
R:  That's the first time he'd ever made that much --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- money.  I mean --
L:  Right.
R:  -- he had always been military, lived on military housing and shopped at the --
L:  [SIGH] [NOISE] 
R:  -- commissary and, you know, so money was always very, very tight.
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  And they were so excited to finally --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- be getting, you know, to that plateau where you can say, "Ah, I can see the light at the end --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- of the tunnel" and -- yeah.
L:  Yeah.  And not have to d- -- oh -- to -- to live on the double coupons and [LAUGH] --
R:  Exactly. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- yeah, live. [LAUGH] I was real -- I -- you know --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I thrill my husband, "And what is all this stuff?"  "Well, I got it free so just shut up". [LAUGH]
R:  That's right  [LAUGH] 
L:  "And try -- and try and eat it". 
R:  Oh.
L:  "It was free.  It was free.  Let me alone".
R:  [LAUGH] That's right.  That's right.  My husband loves my hobbies.
L:  And if they don't like it we feed it to -- we feed it to the neighbor kids, you know. 
R:  That's right.
L:  [MN] [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] [NOISE] 
R:  That's right tho- -- I -- uh -- my feeling is --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- whenever it's free, I get it because I think -- 
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- there's always somebody I can find that can benefit from it. 
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  Even if I don't need it -- uh --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  We have a food bank down the street too --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and -- ah -- I guess -- what was it? -- two years ago, I got fifty packs of hot dogs for like a quarter a piece.
R:  Oh, my God.
L:   I mean good all beef hot dogs and --
R:  Ye- oh those are best.
L:  -- with a coupon on sale and blah, blah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, I took 'em down there to the food bank and they were just thrilled to pieces --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that somebody had actually bought meat, you know.
R:  Yes.
L:  [NOISE] That's -- and ah -- like well, you know, for a quarter piece I can make it a tax write off and --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- you know.  [NOISE] And uh 
R:  But isn't it sad though?  I mean, that kind of goes back to what we were saying before though.  That we have to have food banks in place --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- when we --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- could be doing other things to uplift those people -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that need the help.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  You know -- instead of socking -- you know
