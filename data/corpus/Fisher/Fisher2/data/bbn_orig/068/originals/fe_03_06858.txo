R:  Hello.  Hi, this [NOISE] --
L:  [MN]
R:  This is --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- Vicki [NOISE].
L:  Oh.  Hi, this is Mary.
R:  Hi.
L:  From Washington.
R:  I'm in, er, North Carolina [NOISE].
L:  Em, the topic was airport --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  security --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but, er, what else did she say about it?
R:  She said, "Do you think that the heightened security lessens our chances of having another terrorist attack?" [NOISE]
L:  Oh.  Yeah. --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I should have think so, don't you?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I think it's -- I think it may have prevented something [NOISE].
L:  [MN] Yeah, I think so, too.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  
L:  [MN]
R:  Because [NOISE], ah, I mean  [NOISE] I don't know, it's kind of scary just thinking about it but [NOISE] I think that there's been some more attempts that have been prevented [NOISE].
L:  W- -- well, they haven't had any, er, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- more attacks, or anything, so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it must have helped some.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE]  There's been a lot of high alerts lately that I've -- they've been talking about [NOISE] but, [NOISE] I'm not real concerned.  Are you? [NOISE]
L:  No.  I -- I think if I lived in a bigger city --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, maybe --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- lived in a high rise, or something --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like that.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Or, if I traveled --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a lot, but I don't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- travel anyway, so, er.
R:  Yeah.  I'm not really affected by the whole airport security thing 'cause I don't ever travel either [NOISE].
L:  Um 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I think I would be a little nervous --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if I was -- were on an t- t- --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- airplane now.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Once or twice a week.
R:  [NOISE] I -- I think it -- it really has gotten some people, like, wanting to fight [NOISE] back against all type of things [NOISE] because, [NOISE] just recently, like last week, there was like a robbery attempt in our area [NOISE] and [LAUGH] there was some people that fought back and they took down the guy [NOISE] and the police came and he was, like, [NOISE] already to go down.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, is that right?
R:  You know? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause I think it's kinda changed some stuff [NOISE] for the better.  [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] But ... [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  Sounds like you have a little family --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- there.
R:  Yeah.  We're just got done eating dinner [NOISE] [LAUGH].
L:  Ah.  I can hear some little -- little people.
R:  Yeah.  We got a one year old and a ten year old. 
L:  Oh, fine!
R:  Huh. [NOISE] Well, he'll be ten next month [NOISE] and he'll -- the other one will be one next month.
L:  Oh.  Well, that -- they'll keep you hopping.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yes. [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] I guess we're supposed to be talking about airport security, but --
R:  I don't know if we're allowed to go off the subject [NOISE] or not.  I -- I think that [NOISE]
L:  Well, I think a l- --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I think a little bit doesn't matter.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I'm not really -- [NOISE] I mean, like I said, [NOISE], I'm not real concerned about it, 'cause [NOISE] I don't really travel and I live in -- you said you live in a small town, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there's not really much to talk about, [LAUGH] I guess.  You know.
L:  But, if it's a small town, there's probably not too much going on there, huh?
R:  No.  Not really. [NOISE]
L:  How big --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a town is it?
R:  Well, it's, er, it's called Mount Holly and it's -- it's right outside of a larger town, Charlotte.  I don't know if you've heard of Charlotte. 
L:  Oh yeah, oh yeah.  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] Really!  [LAUGH] Have you heard good things or bad things [NOISE]? 
L:  Um, er, I have a feeling you, er [NOISE]--
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- er, are a member of Refund Makes Cents.
R:  Oh, yes! [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  I am too.
R:  Really?  Wow!  Yeah.  That's where I heard about this at.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah. 
R:  I had a feeling that I would hear from somebody that was on there [NOISE] because I was thinking that we -- I said, like, we would comment at the end, you know, where you can leave comments [NOISE].  I never left one, but, er, I was gonna leave one saying that we should talk about [NOISE] refunding [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Say that's an idea! Yeah, maybe --
R:  Yeah, because [MN] we could go on and on about that [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Well --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the first call I got was about hobbies, so, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that was great.
R:  Oh, really? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I had -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- one call about exercising [NOISE] and one about, um, [NOISE] oh, a part -- your own -- [NOISE] owning your own business [NOISE].
L:  Oh.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Well that -- that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- do you own your own business?
R:  No, huh-uh.
L:  That would be kinda hard to talk about then, wouldn't it?
R:  Y -- oh, yeah.  I mean, I just kinda threw out some ideas and some stuff like that.  [NOISE] I was thinking about maybe starting my own newsletter, but, I haven't really -- haven't really done anything with that [LAUGH] [NOISE].
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, w- what did you say your first name was?
R:  Vicki.
L:  Vicki.  Oh.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Well, I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- maybe see your name on chitchat then, huh?
R:  [NOISE] I've -- I've left, like, one or two messages, like, [NOISE] I was on the one, you know, a toad for a new promise [NOISE]?
L:  Oh --
R:  But that --
L:  -- yeah.
R:  -- [NOISE] did you see my message? [NOISE]
L:  No.  I didn't.
R:  [NOISE] Oh.  But that was only t- -- I only left two messages about that and that was it [NOISE].
L:  Oh, yeah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- well I don't, er, know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- too much about that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that program.
R:  [NOISE] Oh.  Ahah. 
L:  I think it's more if you have children, right?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Probably so.  [NOISE] Children or grandchildren.  It was like --
L:  Yeah, well my g- grandchildren are grown, so ...
R:  Oh, really? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.  You don't -- you don't sound that [NOISE] old.  You sound very young [NOISE].
L:  Oh.  Well, I'm an old timer.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] We've been married fifty six years, you know.
R:  Wow!  Fifty six years. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.  That's probably older than you are --
R:  [NOISE] Ye- -- yeah [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I'm twenty eight [NOISE].
L:  [LAUGH] Oh.
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  Well, er --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- getting back to airport security --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  We live right across --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the river from, er, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Portland, Oregon.
R:  Oh! [NOISE]
L:  At the -- this is Ankara, Washington.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And, um, I guess they have --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a lot of security over there.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I hear they do.  I haven't been over there.
R:  Yeah.  I -- [NOISE] I live like relatively close to the airport around here [NOISE] and it -- it, there's a lot of traffic going, like, overseas.  So, it's an international airport and [NOISE] I ha- -- I don't know really much about it.  [MN] I don't even [NOISE] know anybody that works at the [NOISE] airport [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.  Well --
R:  But I'm glad I'm not inconvenienced [NOISE] by the whole thing, 'cause [NOISE] I bet it -- it's a -- it's a hassle, I bet [NOISE].
L:  It sounds like it.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It sounds like they have a hard time getting these screeners.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah [NOISE].
L:  Er, and they -- well, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- maybe they pay 'em more now than they --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- used to but I heard they didn't pay them too much.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And, er, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so they've -- they weren't too good but, er, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it sounds like, er, [NOISE] they've --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- really improved it a lot.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  But, er ...
R:  Well, when you start paying people more money, you start getting better people [LAUGH].
L:  That's the truth.  Boy, that's true -- that's sure true.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, because, you know [NOISE], you go to McDonalds and you're wondering why your orders not -- taking forever and not the way you want it.  It's because the people who work there are not the highest paid people [LAUGH] in the world.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] That's true.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  Um ...
R:  But somebody's gotta do it [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  It's a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- good job for a teenager just starting out, you know.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Going to school.
R:  Yeah [NOISE].  So, do you work? [NOISE]
L:  No.  No, I don't work.
R:  [NOISE] I mean, you know, I'm just staying at home with the kids right now. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, that's great.  I, er, I didn't work either when, er, I raised my family.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I think it's better that way.
R:  Yeah.  My son just made the [several inaudible words] and he g- -- he even had a trophy, when he --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- left the -- they had like an awards thing, and [NOISE] him and this other boy were the two highest readers in the whole school, and [NOISE] they each got a trophy and I was so proud of him. [NOISE]
L:  Oh.  He must be really smart.
R:  Yes.  I definitely attribute it to me staying at home. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  I think that helps a lot.
R:  Yeah [NOISE].  I don't think he would have definitely not been able [NOISE] to do that if I wasn't.  And I wouldn't be able -- I wouldn't be staying at home really if I didn't have the baby, so ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] I waited till -- I left it kinda late to have the second one [LAUGH] [NOISE].
L:  Ahah.
R:  [NOISE] But ... [NOISE]
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  [NOISE] I'm glad I can stay at home now.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] And the refunding, definitely.  I wouldn't be able to stay at home without that [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] You know.  It makes a big difference, doesn't it?
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  Y- you do a lot of it then, huh?
R:  Yeah.  I -- I just send out like, er, about twenty letters over the last two days.
L:  Oh, gee.  Wonderful!
R:  Yeah.  I really like it. [NOISE] 
L:  I started years ago and, er, many, many years ago.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I used to send off an awful lot then.  Course, stamps were about three cents then, you know.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  And, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but I don't send too much off now --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but I use coupons a lot and double -- I saw double.
R:  Yeah.  [MN] I have a store that -- it's kinda far but it's -- we kinda go up that way whenever we go to the video store, and things like that and, [NOISE] like, WalMart.  We do up there and there's a store up there that doubles up to fifty cents. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  That's what this one does too.
R:  [NOISE] Really.
L:  I- -- it makes quite a difference.
R:  Oh, yes.  Definitely does.  I've -- I've kinda just got started with it.  I've been doing it about a year and a half [NOISE] and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I just got my Refunding Makes Cents subscription in February.
L:  Oh, gee --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you're real busy then.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I -- I don't what -- I w- -- I wish I would have found it sooner [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Would --
R:  But --
L:  -- you -- do you enter the contest on the computer too?
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.  I just got my computer in March [NOISE].
L:  Ahah.
R:  [NOISE] So.  We got that with our income tax check back in -- I've been entering all kind of contests [NOISE].  I haven't won anything, [NOISE] but before that I was, like, entering 'em through the mail
