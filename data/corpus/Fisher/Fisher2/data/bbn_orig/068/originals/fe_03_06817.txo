R:  Um, hi, um, I'm calling on the Fisher project.
L:  Um, hi.  This is Leanne. [LAUGH]
R:  Um, my name's Martin, where do you live?
L:  Uh, Queens, Forest Hills, Queens.
R:  Oh, okay --
L:  How about you, huh?
R:  -- I live in Washington.
L:  Oh, okay, Washington State or Washington, DC?
R:  DC.
L:  Okay, if --
R:  Well, we're, uh, supposed to talk about professional athletes.
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.
R:  And whether or not they deserve the high salaries they're supposed to be paid and whether or not they should strike?
L:  Uh, okay. [LAUGH]
R:  Well --
L:  Yeah, I did -- I sort of missed it when she had said that.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Um, because it went so quickly, the recording.
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, if -- would you like to begin? [LAUGH]
R:  Well, um, I don't know, I've -- I -- are you a fan of sports at all or ...?
L:  I'm not -- I'm not a sports person, I never really have been, I grew up in a houseful that, uh, really acknowledged sports -- so ...
R:  You sort of skip the sports page, huh?
L:  We skip the sports page, nobody ever watched the game, my dad was not, like, a baseball [NOISE] fan or anything, so we --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- just never watched sports, I don't know.
R:  Oh, okay --
L:  What about you?
R:  Well, my dad wasn't a baseball fan so that I became one.
L:  Uh. [LAUGH]
R:  But, uh, well, I don't know, I mean, I would say it depends on whether or not the athlete is doing really well or not.  I mean, there are some athletes who are Hall of Famers who should get, uh, every, uh, dime that they deserve and there are others who signed big contracts and then their careers choked.
L:  Yeah, I -- mm, it's really hard for me to say so I -- I do agree.  I know that some people freak out and they say, "I can't believe that, that athletes get paid so much money" and, like, "Who are they?" you know?  And I agree, especially, I mean, I'm in education and so that's really difficult when, you know, uh -- you know, among teachers who are trying to keep kids out of trouble and do all this and y- you get paid nothing, [LAUGH] but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but, um ...
R:  Well, I mean, it's especially hard when you have a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- city that's trying to build a stadium and they're taking money away from the schools for the stadium.
L:  Right. [LAUGH] Yeah, which is -- right -- it wa- -- and then -- I mean -- but -- and so it does bother me, like, I mean, I think -- I -- I agree and I -- I'm not someone who says, "I can't believe how we worship athletes", and we worship, you know, celebrities and they shouldn't get paid.  No, they should get paid, obviously they're doing something that other people can't and that's fine, it does bother me when they strike.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It does.
R:  Um, do you think they shouldn't be allowed to strike?
L:  I don't think that -- that there should be any -- I don't think that you can step in as a government and say that you don't have the right to strike, I don't believe --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in that.  So, do they have the right to strike?  I think that they should have the right to strike.  Do I think it's moral and ethical?  I think it's -- no, I think it's ridiculous.
R:  Right, right.  Well, I mean, you know, it's -- it's sort of the difference between ordinary working people striking and, uh, really rich people striking.
L:  Yeah, I mean, I know technically that -- so I -- I do think they should have the same rights.  I mean, it is a job and a profession, it is a way of saying, "Hey, we just think that we are worth more" and I -- so I don't think that, based on your salary, you should say, "Well, no you don't deserve that", right?  But, I mean, don't you think it's a -- I don't know, I mean -- I don't know, I think it's unethical because I feel, like, you're making millions and millions of dollars and what -- what is that going to do for you?  Like, what is -- what is that extra -- now five million on top of whatever --
R:  Right.
L:  -- what is that going to do for you?
R:  I mean, there is just a point where people just have more money they can -- than they can ever use for anything.
L:  Right.  I -- I mean, is it so you can now buy that seventeen bedroom home instead of the fifteen bedroom home?  Like, what do -- it's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- not like it's going to charity, [LAUGH] you know.
R:  Right, or tear down your ten bedroom home to put in a seventeen bedroom home.
L:  Right.  Like, what is -- I -- I don't really know why -- I -- I don't know, I guess maybe I --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- don't have a concept of extreme wealth like that. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  Where I -- I can't see how it would be that much more beneficial any way.  So, if -- if -- I feel like that money could go so many better things.  At the same --
R:  Wou- --
L:  -- point though, who is the money coming from?  I mean, if it's coming from the organization anyway and it just depends who's getting rich, you know, then --
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right, well, I mean, it's sort of like a lot of sports, ordinary people can't buy tickets, I mean, because the prices are just so outlandish --
L:  I know.
R:  -- to start off with.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I -- I used to be able to -- at least -- I mean, nosebleed seats you could get for a decent price and now it's -- no -- families can't go anymore.
R:  Right, I mean, it's so -- you know, I know I like hockey and I've only -- went to one hockey game last season because, uh, you know, the minimum price for a good seat was forty bucks.
L:  That doesn't seem[?] -- and that's -- that's where, I guess, that even now -- I -- not even for a [inaudible] sports, but I still -- I like to go to games with friends.  But I don't see that anymore because it -- it is ridiculous to me.  I mean, when I worked for a company that had, uh, you know -- they had box seats to the Nicks, of course.  I mean, you know, like this sky boxing -- I was, like, "Oh, yes sure, I'll take 'em, let's go".  But would I pay for them?  No, because it's insane. [LAUGH] It's in- --
R:  Well -- well, I don't know, I -- I've never been in a sky box.  Well, I was in something called a sky box --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- at Chase Stadium, but that wasn't really a sky box.
L:  Yeah, I know what you're talking about there, yeah.
R:  But, I mean, those were just seats.
L:  Yeah, no it wa- -- I mean, I think things are bad -- I -- it's really cool if you can afford  it but most people can't and the only reason why we did is because it was a large company, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and so they're giving them away.  But, like, I know so many people who want to take their kids and they can't -- or families -- or now --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it's like, "All right, so we're going to spend two hundred dollars to take the kids to a baseball game", [LAUGH] you know.
R:  Right, I mean, you know --
L:  And twenty dollars for a hot dog. [LAUGH]
R:  -- yeah, that just, uh -- that -- that puts it beyond the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- reach of, like, fun.  It's --
L:  But -- but, I don't -- I guess the question is though, is it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that expensive because that's the money that they're paying the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- players with or is, like, the actual sports organization being greedy and they're getting rich off of it?  Like, is it -- is -- are the prices higher because the salaries are higher or is it because they're making a lot more money?  Like, the -- the executives are making a lot of money too?
R:  Well, I suspect --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- everybody's making a lot of money except for, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- maybe the ushers.
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  Um, you know, but the thing is there's only so many times you can raise prices before --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, things start to fall off and, you know, a lot of sports have had that.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I [SIGH] -- it -- it -- it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- bothers me, I mean, I don't know, I guess if there were some more people taking their wealth and doing something with it. [SIGH]
R:  Right.
L:  But a lot of times it's also -- it's not -- I -- I don't know and I guess that maybe this is the stereotype I'm seeing but with the image -- I feel like you see a lot of sports stars and, like, their thing is toy- -- like this nouveau riche -- I'm just going to have, like, fifty cars and I'm going out and partying and it's not -- I don't -- I don't know, like, you just don't s- -- it -- it -- it seems like it bothers me that people make that much money and throw it away. [LAUGH] You know --
R:  Yeah, I think it's the throwing away part that's the problem --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, if you use it to help the poor or to, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- go back to your communities where you came from --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I mean --
L:  And build a -- which people do, in -- in all honesty, they do.  And I -- and I -- I do applaud that, but ...
R:  But it's the ones who just blow it on things that, uh, they shouldn't have in the first place, I mean, those are the, uh -- those are the ones that are really, uh, obnoxious about it.
L:  Yeah, it -- uh, I mean, like, think about -- I guess it bothered me, like, you know, there's, like, ba- -- I'm always [several inaudible words] a baseball strike and people are so pissed off, 'specially New -- New York, it's, like, "Forget it".  Y- you know, the Yankees can't play a game -- it's -- it's over. [LAUGH] You know, and, like -- and it's -- it's, like, I feel -- I think of it as -- it is kind of -- I don't know, it's like an election ,  it's, like, your fans are these people who, like, expect values for everything .  I mean, people, like, they say, "We went to the World Series" and I -- they were not even on the team, you know, they weren't even at the game --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but, "We went to the World Series".  So, people identify them with so much that you think that they would, like, appreciate that and be, like, "You know what, we're not going to do this because our fans are so loyal and they need us" and stuff.  I don't know --
R:  We- -- right.  Well, you know, it's, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that baseball strike, I mean, I went through -- I said I went through baseball --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- detox --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, because I'm somebody -- I go to, you know, maybe ten Oriels games a year and I always --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- try to listen to them on the radio --
L:  Oh really?
R:  -- or on TV and things like that.  But when the strike happened, you know, I just, uh -- I think I looked at old baseball books for three weeks and then I, uh, got it out of my system until they came back.
L:  And you were, like, "Oh yeah, baseball". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, 'cause, you know, the thing is it's -- it's, uh -- it's a voluntary activity --
