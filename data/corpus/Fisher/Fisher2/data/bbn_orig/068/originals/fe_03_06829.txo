L:  [NOISE] My name is Ryan. [NOISE] 
R:  Hi, I'm Julia.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  So. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't honestly know much about this.  I didn't know they were on strike.
L:  Um.
R:  But --
L:  I had -- I don't know.  I don't follow sports at all either.  
R:  Mm. [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
L:  But um, yeah so i- it's -- it's kind of hard for me to think about a bunch of things to talk about but, anyways I [MN] don't think that they deserve high salaries.
R:  Uh-huh.  You don't think they deserve what they're -- they're being paid right now? [NOISE] 
L:  I think they deserve to be paid a lot because they do -- they're under like a lot of stress.  I mean, they're in the public lime light and they have to be in physical sh- -- good physical shape and they're being watched by all the team coaches and everything but, I mean like, the trash people do a lot of hard work too and are being watched and they're not making millions a year so ...
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  So, more equal pay or something?
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  [LIPSMACK] I don't know.  I mean, I guess what I -- I --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I mean I don't really go to sports so um, but I --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- definitely, the one complaint that most people have is that the prices of tickets are just getting ridiculous and -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and if that's why, because the -- the players have to be paid so much, so that's why the tickets are getting so high?  I don't know.  But um, I just -- I feel like, yeah they should paid, you know, a good amount but they shouldn't be paid outrageous salaries.  I mean -- 'cause I mean -- yeah, they are really, you know, putting a lot of work into it through their bodies and stuff and a lot of them, when they're retired, you know [SIGH] -- you know, 'specially in football, um ...
L:  Yeah.  I don't even think any of the ticket sales go directly to their salaries though.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I don't think that really compensates.  I think that just goes towards paying the people that manage them and then the venue that they're using, for the rent, and then pays for overheads.  I don't know where the money that they get comes from that.  Probably like merchandise and [SIGH] stock or something but [SIGH] either way [NOISE] [SIGH] I don't think it's really fair.  But [MN] I don't think actors and actresses should be paid as much as they do either so it's kind of all in the same category.  I mean ...
R:  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, I don't -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- well, I guess I really don't know where the money's coming from for them to be paid that high.  
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  I mean, I figured it probably had something to do with ticket sales but --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um [LIPSMACK] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- pro- probably advertisement too has a lot to do with it. 
L:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] Yeah, probably from just like the huge corp- -- mean, probably like all this sponsorship too --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- -s they're sponsored by [NOISE] everyone.
R:  Yeah.  They probably get paid a lot of money through sponsorship.  Yeah.  I mean I guess --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [MN] [SIGH] it seems just kinda crazy today the way, um, the value of money is just kind of totally skewed. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  It's like some people just [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- make outrageous amounts and --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, it's not evenly distributed at all.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly and it's just -- and then the people who [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- who you know do the hourly -- you know, making seven dollars or nine dollars an hour um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- just barely get by from one pay check to the next --
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  -- and it's not -- it's not completely --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um even.  That's for sure.  
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] 
R:  But um ...
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, but that's I guess the way it's [NOISE] -- it's always been. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah, I don't -- I don't -- I don't know why they're going on strike to get more money. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, is that why they're going on strike?
R:  I have no idea.  Honest, I didn't even know they were on strike.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I don't really know so ...
L:  [NOISE] I [MN] 
R:  I heard that's what she said when she said the topic.
L:  [LAUGH] I don't know.  I thought it was the unfair wages [MN] -- I don't -- well --
R:  Okay. [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't -- I have no id- -- I don't -- if like you --
R:  Okay.  Yeah.
L:  -- agree with 'em being paid?
R:  Well, I don't know who -- I mean, but [SIGH] -- I don't know.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  They're -- I think they're being paid a lot and I mean it's just -- definitely has --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, is driven by the industry that they're in.  Same thing with actresses and actors and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um ...
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  You know, I mean it --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they've -- the actors and actresses are pushed to be paid you know, a good amount you know, to be -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- to be --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- able to make the amount of --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- money that other people that are in the movie business gonna make.  And I think that's fair 'cause they are, you know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- putting out that.  I don't know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- what's driving all these --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- crazy salaries though. [SIGH] But ...
L:  [SIGH] Yeah well, I guess they do work a lot harder than [NOISE] the average person that's holding like a nine to five job but [SIGH] -- [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but still there's a lot of people [NOISE] that do work probably just as hard and just don't get any recognition.  That are getting paid, you know like you said like the ten dollars an hour -- [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] [NOISE] so I mean it's hard to say what's fair and all that.  I mean, like [NOISE] why should a person just like -- [NOISE] why should someone, you know, be upset about someone else making a lot of money --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when it -- [NOISE] as long as you know, you have your [NOISE] -- you're able to get by, like you know? [NOISE]  Better off for someone else and that means that they're lucky.  [NOISE] [SIGH] 
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
L:  So then why should we care?  Kind of, I don't know.  But I mean, I guess like it -- it's hard not to care when, like you're living paycheck to paycheck --
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you see someone that's so -- [NOISE] you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like one word on a commercial.
R:  I mean it is -- it is a fair game.  I mean pretty much anyone who actually --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and there's a lot of people -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- who come from nothing that are actors and actresses and, you know, it's -- it's completely open market.  I mean it's not unfair in that way.  [NOISE] [SIGH] You know, you just have to have the talent or whatever.  Um, but you know people come from all different backgrounds and I think in -- in a lot of ways it's made that a little bit more even. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  You know, as far as all different kinds of social backgrounds and that type of thing, they've --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- you know?
L:  -- it's definitely like fair play for --
R:  Yeah.  It is fair play, yeah. [SIGH] So um -- but I -- oh -- I -- yeah.  I don't really know what's driving the salaries thinking of going up and up and up, you know?  I don't really know why but [SIGH] it just seems like that's the way it's always been.  Just [LAUGH] ...
L:  Yeah but for them to go on strike is kind of ridiculous unless there's like some unseen policies up to pressuring on them.
R:  [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] 
L:  Like, it better not be for a higher wage or something like that because that's just ridiculous.
R:  Yeah.  Well, maybe they didn't even say that.  I thought that [NOISE] [LAUGH] but anyways [SIGH] ...
L:  Yeah, I'm not sure --
R:  But um, yeah.  But um, yeah see I --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- yeah I really don't know what's driving salaries.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  It's just --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it's --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- in- interesting --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that's for sure and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um.  Yeah.  -s definitely interesting. [LAUGH] [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE] Hm.  [SIGH] [NOISE] [SIGH] 
R:  I'd like to know more about it though.
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] Yeah.  [NOISE] I'm actually trying to look it up on the internet to see [SIGH] -- 
R:  Oh you are? [LAUGH] 
L:  -- if we can have anything to talk about. [LAUGH]  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH] But ...
R:  But yeah, it's uh -- it's that lifestyle that drives --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- these you know, these huge salaries and they're --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know they --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I don't know.
L:  [NOISE] Hm.  [SIGH] [NOISE] Yeah, I don't even think that they're going on strike. [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [NOISE] I don't know.  Oh, "Should athletes strike?" [NOISE] 
R:  Oh.
L:  [NOISE] Okay.  "Athletes strike a symbolic blow.  Blow Peace for Asian Games".  [NOISE] Oh, it's, "Athletes from North and South Korea have marched together in show of unity at the opening ceremony of the Asian Games in --" [NOISE] blah, blah, blah. [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, so they're striking for more money?
L:  [NOISE] It says [SIGH] -- [NOISE] oh, "The athletes' strike is a symbolic blow for peace at Asian Games" so I guess like our strike is like [NOISE] kind of taking a blow at the [NOISE] North and South Korea [NOISE] Peace Games.
R:  Oh.
L:  [NOISE] And so like maybe that's why it's like such a big controversy.  If people are making [NOISE] -- uh, are striking while someone [NOISE] else's trying to demonstrate peace, I think that makes it [NOISE] a lot worse. [NOISE] 
R:  Oh yeah, definitely. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  So, that's -- that's kind of odd but [NOISE] yeah.  I don't have TV so I don't know. [LAUGH]  Things are -- [NOISE] things are bad with athletes if they're really on strike but --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] if they are on strike and I'm sure they can get people out -- well, play for their wage.
R:  Oh, yeah. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Definitely.
L:  But I guess there's not too many Kobes and [NOISE] Shaqs out there --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that can be so easily replaced, [NOISE] so that's probably why they get paid so much money.  It's because, like you know [NOISE] --
R:  Well, I mean they definitely are talented.
L:  -- you can't get another person if it [inaudible].  Yeah, they're definitely talented but there's so many other people who I think are really talented too.  Like in music and in sports and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and various things, and like they don't get the recognition there because of looks or they can't be marketed.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think --
R:  Oh yeah --
L:  -- it all just has to --
R:  -- definitely marketing plays the biggest role.  I mean that's probably where a lot of the money's coming from.  [SIGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Some --
R:  It's the marketing so ...
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I think that's what it really all comes down to.  You can have the talent, but if you don't have talent and ability to be marketed then your talent isn't really worth anything.  I think at least in the eyes of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] -- society or success --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so that's pretty sad.  To think that's the way our country is [NOISE] starting to be formed.
R:  [LIPSMACK] But I mean if somebody's using somebody, you know, to market their product and they're making a lot of money off their product, I do feel like they do need to pay that person, but, you know ...
L:  [NOISE] Oh yeah.  Definitely.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Like if someone's making a ton of money [NOISE] then --
R:  Off of you, yeah.
L:  -- like they're gonna --
R:  Yeah, then you definitely --
L:  [NOISE] -- then I would wanna be paid a percentage of that huge sum.
R:  Yeah right.
L:  [SIGH] [NOISE] So --
R:  So then --
L:  -- I don't know.  It's kind of hard to say.
R:  It -- well, it's just the industry they're in.  It's just re- -- you know, it's just that's what --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- has it -- make it -- makes it that way.  [SIGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Yes.
R:  I don't know.
L:  I guess it's the industry but at -- at the same time I think --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it's the society's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- need to want something beautiful --
R:  Yes. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- is what's making the industry that way, so it's kind of like a [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] -- I don't know, like a double play.  [NOISE] Like [SIGH] i- -- just two sides of the same coin.  I think that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- both society and [NOISE] the industry are kind of --
R:  Yeah I mean --
L:  -- force it to be that way.
R:  -- it's like there's just definitely [inaudible] factors that are driving it and making it that way so [SIGH] um ...
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  And I mean, you know, I mean it's hard for people to turn down if someone's gonna give them a ton of money.  You know?
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  It's hard for people to turn it down.  But I mean, I just -- you know you -- I honestly, I just hope people who have a lot of money, that they actually use it, you know, to help people who --
L:  [NOISE] [MN] 
R:  -- who really do need it, you know.  Don- -- you know, give it to charity and that type of thing.
L:  Yeah I think there's --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- some people that do, but then there's the --
R:  Yeah, and then there's those [NOISE] --
L:  -- ones that have two houses in like --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- each city and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's like those -- those Osbourne kids.  I mean --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- they just drive me insane. [MN] [NOISE] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] They have a ton of money and they go shopping at Tiffany's and they talk about like, you know [NOISE] how the dog shit like underneath the table.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It just makes me sick.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But so, anyway like that has anything to do [LAUGH] with sports fans.  
R:  No, no.
L:  There, there, there.
R:  I know -- I mean it -- but I -- I agree.  I mean it's like -- honestly I mean, [MN] I think it --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- always -- you should always keep in perspective.  It's like, "Do you need to build a house that's that huge?"  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I [MN] I don't know. 
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  I mean [LAUGH] really?  You know?
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  I don't know.  If someone gave me --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- four million dollars all of a sudden, I don't know what I would do with it but I --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- think, I would hope that I'd --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- actually use it for more important things than --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- than living really lavishly.  I think --
L:  Yeah.  But I guess like we --
R:  -- I'd always want to live in perspective, but you know --
