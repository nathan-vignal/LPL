L:  Hello. 
R:  [NOISE] Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Danielle from North Dakota.
R:  I'm Patty from Seattle.
L:  Oh, nice to talk to you. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, you too. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  Uh --
R:  How's things in North Dakota today?
L:  Ah, mosquitoy. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.  Well, we're having some nice weather here for a change. 
L:  Oh, we did.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  It was ninety today but the mosquitoes have --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- hatched so ...
R:  Oh my gosh.  Ninety degrees.
L:  Yup, so it makes it a little more miserable when the mosquitoes come out.
R:  Oh.  [SIGH] Yeah, I guess so.
L:  [LAUGH] So, what do you think of the strikes with professional athletes?
R:  [NOISE] Ah, I think it's ridiculous. 
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  What do you think?
L:  I agree.  They get way too much money. [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm like, "Hey, what do you guys want?  You already get paid millions and billions of dollars for playing games."
L:  For playing games, and they don't play that many. [NOISE] 
R:  The rest of us have to work.  [LAUGH] Gimme a break.
L:  Have to work, raise kids.  There are people in the streets that are starving and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- these guys are making millions and say that it's not enough.  I just don't agree.
R:  Yeah. [SIGH] Well, it seems really ridiculous to me. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] I think that there should definitely be a -- a cap.  You can only make this much and -- [LIPSMACK] and that should be it.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Millions and millions and twenty million and that's too much for -- [LIPSMACK] for one person -- for people to go watch and then they get to charge hundreds of dollars for tickets if you want to go and watch.
R:  [SIGH] Well, then they say that [LIPSMACK] if there wasn't a market for it, you know, they wouldn't pay 'em that much and blah, blah, blah.  But I don't go to professional games because -- ever since the first time the baseball players went on strike I haven't gone to a professional baseball game.
L:  [LIPSMACK] And we don't have any in North Dakota.  We'd have to go to Minneapolis --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for the closest one so we don't go either but, I --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- don't know that I would even, for that kind of cost.  To sit in the nose bleed seats for what you could afford to feed ... [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, yeah.  I just think -- well [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] I want to say I think it all goes back to the same old warrior mentality in society.  You know?  Honor the warriors and so the professional sports athletes are the warriors of the day, right?
L:  Yuck.  No, the fire fighter, the police officers, [LAUGH] people --
R:  Well, I mean they get all that -- you know, that used to be given to warriors.  Right?  All the glory and the honor and the goods, right?
L:  Yeah.  I just think that they're -- they are highly overpaid --
R:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] 
L:  -- for -- for the ninety minutes they go out on the court [LAUGH] or whatever sport that it is.  It -- it's just too much.  Too much when there's too many people that don't have any money.
R:  [NOISE] Right.  And that actually have to make a little bit of money [SIGH] stretch out an awful long ways.
L:  [LIPSMACK] And then they make that millions of dollars from age eighteen to twenty six and then they can retire and not have to work another dime.  And then they'll file bankruptcy when they get older and [SIGH] ...
R:  Well, yeah.  It's sort of an irresponsible age anyways, isn't it?
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  Yeah.  Too bad.
L:  The popularity gets to 'em and they just spend, spend, spend.  I say, "I never feel bad when anybody famous goes and files bankruptcy because if you can't manage that much money -- "
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  "-- and live off of it without overspending, [LIPSMACK] then it's time to change professions".
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Time to get a job. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Or something.  [LAUGH] Train to do something.  So, what part of North Dakota are you in?
L:  [LIPSMACK] I live in Fargo.  Right on the --
R:  Oh, you're right on the border?
L:  Right on the border like, walk across the [NOISE] street and be in Moorhead in Minnesota.
R:  Oh.  The only reason I know that is because I used to know somebody that was from Moorhead --
L:  Okay, yeah.
R:  -- [LAUGH] that walked right across the border from there.
L:  Yeah.  They're kinda sister cities there.  You just kinda come and go together.  But it's ah [LIPSMACK] it's a nice area to live if you can handle the winter.
R:  Pretty bitter huh?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Ah, it hasn't been bad for a few years now but it's definitely cool.  But you enjoy your summer so much more then. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah well, let's see.  They had a few -- they had a couple years of floods in North Dakota.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm trying to think.  And then droughts and -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I mean, it sounded all weird to me because I don't really know the geography of the area.  I don't really understand what was going on.
L:  Oh, it's just one big flat empty plain with [NOISE] farmers' fields and [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- houses here and there. [NOISE] 
R:  Oh.
L:  [LIPSMACK] But you get all the beautiful water there.
R:  Yeah, and there's -- what do they say?  Ten thousand lakes?  A thousand lakes?  I don't know --
L:  Ten thousand. [NOISE] 
R:  -- a million lakes? 
L:  Ten thousand lakes.
R:  Lots of lakes.
L:  Yup.  You can travel about every fifteen minutes and be in a lake. [NOISE] 
R:  [MN] 
L:  So, it's nice to live here because every weekend everybody leaves and we go to the lake.
R:  Oh, is that what you do?
L:  Mhm.
R:  So -s everybody go canoeing?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Ah, we go fishing.  We have a pontoon and we have a speedboat and we used the speedboat for waterskiing or knee boarding or tubing and then on the pontoon to go fishing with the whole family.
R:  Oh that sounds fun.
L:  So.  Yeah, you get to get away and not have to clean your house or listen to the phone ring or ... you just --
R:  [LAUGH] Sounds really nice, huh.
L:  -- get up in the morning and go sit out on the picnic table and play some games outside or badminton or croquet or whatever you want to do and at night you sit by the fire and make smores.
R:  [NOISE] Hey, that sounds like the life --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- except for all those mosquitoes.
L:  [LAUGH] [MN] 
R:  Yeah, I don't know if I'd like that.
L:  And when the mosquitoes come out, then it's pretty vicious.
R:  So, is this when they're worst?  The beginning of the summer --
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- or what?
L:  No, it -d -- they hatch throughout the whole summer so it's -- they'll start -- start spraying for them soon and then it won't be as bad with West Nile this -- they're more apt to spray now, [LIPSMACK] sooner, but [SIGH] ah, they're big mosquitoes mainly.  My -- the neighbors always joke, "The mosquitoes are out, put your kids away.  They'll carry them away".
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] That's all.  They look like everyone has chickenpox all the time because of all the mosquito bites.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, gosh.  That's terrible. 
L:  [MN] What do --
R:  Oh yuck.
L:  -- what do people do for fun in Seattle?
R:  [SIGH] Ah, what do they do for fun in Seattle?  I dunno what the heck they do, you know?  I'm just a student here.  I don't have any fun, but [SIGH] --
L:  Just go to school and that's it?
R:  --yeah, we drink coffee.  What?
L:  Just go to school?
R:  [SIGH] Well, it's not like I have like lots of money to -- or spare time.
L:  And --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- what are you going to school for?
R:  Oh, I'm trying to get my Master's Degree in linguistics and so [MN] ... you know, it's pretty much go to school, work, eat --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- sleep, go to school.  [MN] 
L:  I just got my Masters two weeks ago.
R:  You did?
L:  Yup.
R:  [MN] 
L:  Just finished and went through Graduation Ceremony two weeks ago.
R:  Well, congratulations.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Nice to --
R:  What did you get it in?
L:  Special Ed. [NOISE]
R:  Well, good for you.
L:  I teach here an' [MN] I've grown up here in Fargo and lived here my whole life and [NOISE] now teach here so ... uh, have to get more money -- if you're gonna make any money you have to have your Masters. [NOISE] 
R:  Well, good for you.
L:  Are you hoping to leave Seattle then when you're done?
R:  Oh yes. [SIGH]  I'm not, you know, from here so it's sort of, well -- [SIGH] the weather here doesn't really appeal to me.
L:  Where are you from?
R:  Well, from Colorado. [SIGH] 
L:  Oh, beautiful skiing.
R:  Yeah [SIGH] your blue skies and everything, you know [LIPSMACK] and it's a very different sort of climate here.
L:  And the college brought you to Seattle?
R:  Yeah, I came here for the program that they have. [SIGH] 
L:  [MN] 
R:  [LIPSMACK] So, yeah but, yeah I'll be done in another year and then we'll see what happens.
L:  And what is the weather like there?
R:  Where, in Seattle?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right now, today, it's very nice. [SIGH]  A very nice day today but normally it's like overcast, [SIGH] raining, [LIPSMACK] sprinkling, raining.
L:  Do people like it there?
R:  Yeah, well, people who grow up here and stuff seem to be okay with it.  Half the people that move here from sunny places -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- do adjust to it.
L:  Ah.  I love the sunshine.
R:  Yeah. [SIGH] Well. [SIGH] Yeah, I just -- ya know like that's all right, people that [MN] grew up here and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- ya know, it doesn't bother them. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  That's all they ever knew.
L:  They must all be medicated for depression. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] That's right.  [NOISE] 
L:  Can't get out and go and enjoy things outside. [MN] 
R:  Well, you know you basically just learn how to do things in -- I mean, most the time when it's raining it doesn't rain hard, you know?  Not hard rain.  It's sort of --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- always wet.
L:  And what is the temperature like?
R:  Eh, it's pretty mild.  You know?  Most of the time [SIGH] it's pretty mild.
L:  [MN] 
R:  I don't know, in the winter, really cold days -- maybe forty five.
L:  Oh man, that's nothing.
R:  I mean, it snowed twice since I've been here.  That's it.  The whole city closes down when it snows.
L:  Oh, I'm sure.
R:  And it's like insane.  Like the whole city is like, closed, shut.
L:  'Cause nobody knows how to drive.
R:  It's like hilarious .  [NOISE] 
L:  And where in Colorado are you from?
R:  In Dillon.
L:  And so you're used to some snow?
R:  Lots of --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- snow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Did you ever go skiing there?  Do you know Colorado --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- at all?
L:  No.  My husband went a few times to go --
R:  Oh, oh --
L:  -- skiing there but --
R:  -- where was that?  Like ninety two hundred feet [MN]?  So, in the county I lived in there were four major ski areas.
L:  Yeah.  My husband has gone a couple of times and went in straight in the condominium there and [SIGH] he said the -- just doesn't even compare to skiing here.  He goes, "You make your own trails, the snow is waist high, it's powder, it's beautiful".
