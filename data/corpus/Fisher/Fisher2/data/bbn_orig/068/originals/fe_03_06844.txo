L:  [NOISE].
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.  My --
R:  Hello.
L:  -- name is Ellen.
R:  Hi.  My name is Moka.  Um 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Are you -- where are you?
L:  I'm in Vermont.
R:  You're in Vermont?  Oh, I'm Kitty Corner across the country.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH].  In Tucson.  Anyway, er, so we're supposed to talk about airport security?
L:  Right.  [NOISE] Do --
R:  -- What do --
L:  -- you really think it helps? [NOISE]
R:  I -- I have to assume that it must be helping.  I don't know.  What do you think?
L:  [NOISE].  I'm not really sure.  I don't do a lot of traveling, so I'm not [MN] too familiar with what it was like before versus what it's like now.
R:  Ahah.
L:  A lot of people I've talked to are still scared of flying [NOISE] so I don't know if it may be making [NOISE] people more nervous than [NOISE] it was before and maybe that's why it's better [NOISE], or, if, having more people there [NOISE] is -- is giving people a -- more of a sense of safety [NOISE].
R:  Well, giving people on the traveling end more of a sense of safety and maybe one of the thing- -- whether it's true or not, what they always say about having a cop on the beat is, if they know there's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- somebody watching --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- then people are --
L:  [NOISE].
R:  -- less likely to just try to do something, maybe.
L:  [NOISE] That might be true [NOISE] too.  Maybe they're seeing the increased, ah, security and they're deciding that that's not a good thing for them to do --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- or, at least, not at that airport, or --
R:  Mhm.  What airport would you go out of when you go out?
L:  Er, [SIGH] well, it would be either Burlington or Albany.  Burlington is a -- a smaller --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- airport, so I'm not sure that the security would be as strong as out of Albany which is probably one of the larger ones we have in the area.
R:  Uh-huh.  But even that --
L:  [NOISE].
R:  -- isn't like, a big airport, like -- I don't know, like, Chicago or something where it's a hub and everybody's running in and running out.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, it might not make a whole lot of difference --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in your local airport.
L:  Right.  Well in -- in -- I think because Vermont is a more rural state --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, I know here, now they're requiring people to have a photo ID to even get on the plane.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Which is probably not a big deal in other states but in Vermont we don't even require a photo ID on our driver's license.  So, we --
R:  So, what do you --
L:  -- had people --
R:  -- use?
L:  -- Well, that's the whole problem -- is now you have all these people who for years --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- have never had any problems and now, all of a sudden they have to come up with all these forms of identification, so, you know, you have to go to --
R:  Which they don't even own.
L:  Right.  So then they have to make a special trip down to the Department of Motor Vehicles and pay extra to have a photo driver's license before they let them --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- get on the plane, so 
R:  Whereas, they didn't even need it for their driver's license -- 
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- before.  Weird [LAUGH].
L:  I -- I mean, I'm sure if you're --
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  -- in a big city and, you know, its -- its probably has a higher crime rate or whatever than we do here --
R:  Mhm.  Ahah.
L:  -- then maybe it makes people feel safer but what I hear is that it's sort of more of a hassle --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and its, you know, they're not as worried about it here, I guess --
R:  [MN].
L:  -- and they see it to be more of a hassle than --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- than a help.
R:  Ahah.  Our local airport is also -- I mean, not as small -- probably about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I've never been to Albany's airport, but probably about that size, but that's relatively a small airport still and, at first, I was really angry [LAUGH] because it always seemed to be -- I mean, I'm not that young and I would look around and the -- the security personnel really were working so hard to not pick people that it would look like they were racial profiling --
L:  Oh, oh.
R:  -- but they seemed to be hitting all the little old ladies like me --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- only older, okay?  So, people like my mum's age, people with blue hair --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- are the only ones that seemed --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to be getting checked. 
L:  Ah.
R:  And I was like, "Wait a minute.  That's not the --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- point, folks".
L:  No, no. 
R:  I mean, it isn't gonna be a little old lady with blue hair and -- and making the little old ladies with blue hair stand up there in public --
L:  Right.
R:  -- undoing their zipper --
L:  [NOISE].
R:  -- compartments and showing their underwear in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- front of everybody is not --
L:  Right.
R:  -- gonna convince anybody --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that it's safer to travel.
L:  That's true.  You see, w- -- even again, in the area of Vermont that I'm in -- our minority population is so small --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that -- that might not be as much of an issue, although probably it would in Albany, um, 'cause they have a much higher --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, rate of minorities than we do.
R:  Mhm
L:  So, I'm not sure how they would choose people up here if I flew out of, say, the Burlington Airport --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and maybe they'd just choose every tenth person or whatever to -- to go through their bags.
R:  Oh, I -- I think I would even mind less every tenth person than where it looks like they're particularly picking --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the little old ladies with rinsed hair that you just, "Oh, come on guys" [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, it does seem very --
R:  [LAUGH] [MN].
L:  -- unlikely that somebody like that would be, you know, the one that was [NOISE]  going to be involved in a terrorist attack. 
R:  Yeah.  And now they've gone another step which is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ostensibly, you've got all these check in procedures --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- when you're already going down to the gate, but at the same time they let people check themselves in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- by computer --
L:  Really?
R:  -- so that they don't have to -- yeah.  So, when you're on the outside and you're  -- they don't -- there isn't a human being that says, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "Are you sure nobody else --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- touched your baggage?"
L:  Right.
R:  At which the --
L:  Like, you're gonna say, "Yes". [NOISE] 
R:  Like you're gonna say yes anyway.  That's true --
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  -- but, to make it just one more step past --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the believable, they have a computer that asks you, "Are you sure nobody else touched your luggage?" --
L:  Are you kidding?
R:  -- and then you hit the screen.
L:  [LAUGH].  
R:  I mean, what's --
L:  Well, like the terrorist --
R:  -- the point?
L:  -- is going to say, "Yes, I gave it to my friend who put a bomb in it, you know [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- before they get on the airplane [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  Right.  Oh, y- you know.
L:  Well that does seem sort of silly, I -- you know, the criminal's not exactly going to mind lying to begin with.
R:  Y- -- and -- and even then, part of the idea, I think, of having a -- a person that asks the question is, if the person has some kind of intuition that somebody's uncomfortable with their own answer then --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they might, you know, hit a button somewhere and get somebody checked.
L:  Sure, well, you know --
R:  But if it --
L:  -- they avert their eyes or they flush or they act a little nervous, or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- guilty, or -- or something like that --
R:  Well, hopefully they would look really nervous or something.  But, if --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the only one checking you is this --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- computer screen --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and you just hit the computer screen --
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  -- there is no way --
L:  [NOISE] No, that's --
R:  -- so you --
L:  -- very true.
R:  So, it means there are extra --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- procedures but are they useful?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Maybe, you're right [LAUGH].
L:  Well, I --
R:  They're not always --
L:  -- hope they're useful.  I mean, I wouldn't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Ah, like I said, I don't travel a lot so it's probably not a -- something that I'm gonna be too familiar with, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I like to think that if I got on an airplane that somebody would be putting a little bit more attention into trying to pick out the suspicious looking people, or whatever, um.
R:  Yeah.  And that isn't a computer screen.
L:  Ye- -- no.  A computer I can't see as being useful at all.  I mean --
R:  Right.  I agree. 
L:  -- th- there's no -- there's no person to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- person contact there.
R:  Right.
L:  There's not anything that -- I mean, a computer can't tell if you're lying or if you're [LAUGH] --
R:  Right!
L:  -- you know, looking stressed out or, if you're --
R:  Mhm.  Right.
L:  -- so that -- that doesn't seem to be a very useful tool but 
R:  No, and nor does a -- a security guard who feels that either to avoid hassles or -- or just, I don't know, because they look like the easiest people to ask, is t- -- is to ask old people who won't complain [LAUGH].
L:  Right.  Well, and you would think too that if -- if most of the terrorists are -- are of Middle Eastern descent, that --
R:  And they're young, like --
L:  -- Right, then.
R:  -- under twenty five.
L:  I mean, I can understand I suppose that it would look like you were discriminating against them because you were only choosing people that fit that nationality but if those are the ones that are most likely to be the terrorists then, shouldn't they be the ones that you're asking about all this?
R:  Well.  I think so, or --
L:  Although, maybe a b- -- you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- tall blond haired, blue eyed twenty five year old I suppose could just as likely [NOISE], you know, have a bomb in his suitcase for other reasons, I guess, but --
R:  But then --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there we still have the -- you may not -- you may not want to look like you're doing racial profiling but I really don't see any reason why you can't do some kind of rough age profiling.
L:  Yeah.  That's true.  I mean, it -- it doesn't -- although, maybe someone will get wise and they'll send us an eighty five year old, you know, blue haired --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- grandmother in there with -- I mean, it seems sort of unlikely to me, but  uh, I guess --
R:  Well 
L:  -- I guess it could happen.
R:  Well, let's hope no- nobody gets the bright idea [LAUGH].
L:  No!  Heaven forbid, no, that's er 
R:  Right.
