R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I'm on the phone!
R:  [NOISE] [MN] Hello!
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi. [NOISE]
L:  Hi.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  This is Bethany.
R:  [NOISE] And this is Wauneta [NOISE].
L:  Hi Wauneta, how are you?
R:  [NOISE] Fine.  How you doing? [NOISE]
L:  Pretty good.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, I've had this topic to discuss before --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so why don't you tell --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- me what you think about a- [LAUGH] -- airport security.
R:  [NOISE] Well, I -- I couldn't even hardly hear it because I was at work and it sounded like it was about airport security [NOISE].
L:  Yeah.
R:  Would it lessen the terrorists [NOISE]?
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] I could va- vag- vaguely hear them [NOISE]
L:  Oh!
R:  But I thought that's what [NOISE] I had interpreted, but I wasn't [NOISE] sure [LAUGH]. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah [NOISE].
R:  Mhm.
L:  What are [NOISE] your thoughts on that?
R:  [NOISE] Well, um, from what I can see it -- it may be -- might be a benefit [NOISE] in one way and a benefit in another way [NOISE].  Um   I feel like that, with all the technology that they have, they should be able to have things that can be seen through [NOISE].  Anyone, I mean, because the world is so technical now [NOISE] that they should be able to pick up anything if anybody comes through there [NOISE].
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] And far as lessening the security, that's when I thought that they had these different machines and things for.  But, um, [NOISE] it's just so inconvenient if you d- -- flying in the a- -- I mean it helps out [NOISE] or if, you know, happen to save a lot of lives, but, with all the technology that we have they should be able to do it much -- in a better way of, you know, for screening out terrorists [NOISE].
L:  Right.
R:  Then, a lot of times, from what I can see and [NOISE] gather, er, that the United States talk a lot and tell too much about what they got [NOISE].
L:  Mm.
R:  And that happens to [NOISE] give out -- and leak out information to keep these people abreast upon everything [NOISE].
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] So if they, you know, do a lot of stuff in secret, that would help out a lot too [NOISE].  To lessen, you know, the terrorists coming in, or anyone coming in.  It don't have to be them per se, you know [NOISE].
L:  Right, right. 
R:  Mhm.  It could be anyone [NOISE].  That w- -- you know, with the help with the, um, stopping it. [NOISE]
L:  Exactly.
R:  [NOISE] So many things coming in through the airports are anywhere in the world. [NOISE]
L:  Right --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- whether its terrorists, or +contraband, that sort of thing.  Is that what you're saying?
R:  [NOISE] Right.  I couldn't hear what you're saying [NOISE].
L:  Are you -- are you saying like, er, ju- -- not only --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- keeping terrorists out --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but also, like, people that are trying --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to, er, transport drugs and things --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of that nature?
R:  [NOISE] Yes.  Uh-huh [NOISE].
L:  Yeah, I know.  I agree on that -- 
R:  Mhm [NOISE].
L:  -- side of it.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  We just recently --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- traveled --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- um, by aircraft and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- there was definitely more technology at the airport than the last time I traveled, and the last time I traveled was, er, post nine -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- eleven.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  Um, they did, you know, some extra security --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- checks on our bags and --
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  -- then the bags were actually gone through, um --
R:  [NOISE] Okay.
L:  -- at -- at the airport.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  So, yeah, it delayed us --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- um, I didn't -- I didn't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- feel, you know, offended, um, --
R:  [NOISE] Mm.
L:  -- violated --
R:  [NOISE] Mm.
L:  -- in any way, shape or form, But I don't know, maybe that's [LAUGH] just me.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I just thought, "Like, okay, its an extra check".
R:  [NOISE] Mm.
L:  Um.  You know.  Hopefully this is something that would definitely deter --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- a terrorist from --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- you know, trying to pu- -- put something on an airplane that I'm gonna be on.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.  Right.
L:  So, you know, we don't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- know, um, as of yet, how many --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- people -- how many incidents our upgraded security --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- has prevented --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Because see, they not gonna tell you that [NOISE].
L:  An- --
R:  The news will let --
L:  -- and -- and again, how --
R:  -- you know so much.
L:  A- and I understand what you're saying, is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is that, you know, they're not gonna tell us about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- potential threats that were --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, elated or -- or, --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- er, that sort of thing.
R:  That's treated like -- like [NOISE] with the nine one one.  They was aware of that from the very beginning.
L:  Right.
R:  And they [NOISE] didn't tell the United States.  They told them when they got ready to tell them later on and when other people started commenting.  'Cause I have been -- I've worked at an airport and I have been around [NOISE] when different things went [NOISE] down but they didn't let the -- the public know [NOISE] --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- until they wanted them to know [NOISE].  You know.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] So that's why it makes me so mad [SIGH] that they have all this technology and they get all this information.  And [SIGH] see a lot of times these people will be tired and they've been at work all night, all day, or whatever.  Or they out partying, or whatever [NOISE].  We never know what the situation is. [NOISE]
L:  No, we don't.
R:  And then they say well, "Oh, I just thought it wasn't that serious". [NOISE]
L:  Right.
R:  You know [NOISE].  And then, Bam!  Here goes something that went down, just like that.  Nobody's gonna take it seriously.
L:  Right.
R:  'Cause a lot of times they don't listen to someone calling in and giving them information.  They take those -- they don't take those people serious. [NOISE]
L:  Right.  Right.  But, I'm --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- thinking they're taking a little bit more serious these days, don't you?
R:  Mhm.  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  I certainly hope so.  That's for -- 
R:  I hope so!
L:  -- that's for sure!  That's for sure.
R:  They might tell us some things but they ain't gonna tell us everything, boy [LAUGH].
L:  No.  No.  Not at all.
R:  Mm. [NOISE]
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Huh.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Ah [SIGH].
R:  So ... [NOISE]
L:  I -- like I said --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, some people are put off by their -- the inconvenience --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- at the airport.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  Er, me, myself, I just think --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- that a little --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- bit of inconvenience for a whole lot of, --
R:  Mhm [NOISE].
L:  -- er, er, comfort in my heart, knowing that, you know --
R:  [NOISE] Mm.
L:  -- everyone's going through this.  It's not -- I'm not being singled out --
R:  [NOISE] No, its --
L:  -- and I --
R:  -- not --
L:  -- see some people acting like they're singled out, you know.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, no!
L:  "Oh, it's me, they're picking --"
R:  'Cause I think they --
L:  " -- my bag".
R:  -- do everybody like that now.
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.  
R:  They don't just do one person, or just pick -- they used to do that now.  They used to do random checks.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  But now they make everybody stop and go through it.  It -- it doesn't matter what color, nationalities, or whatever.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  They make you go through that screening [NOISE] before going on that plane, you know [NOISE]
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  But I just [NOISE] decided to travel by car, or whatever, until, you know, they really, really [NOISE] get their selves together on what they're gonna do, with the war --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- situation [NOISE].
L:  Yeah, yeah.  It is, you know --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  It is scary --
R:  Mhm [NOISE].
L:  -- to, er ...
R:  'Cause you don't never know where its gonna hit at, [SIGH] and then they don- -- they don't tell you the truth about some of the situations that's going on now [NOISE].  With the SARS and different [NOISE] things and -- just something[?] up for a while, then they [NOISE] just decide to come up and tell us about it, you know [NOISE].
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] But, it's been out for a while [NOISE].  If anyone was paying attention to the news [NOISE] about four or five years ago, that stuff started on the -- er, railroad, I mean, on the train [NOISE] when there was, 'em, modern like trains [NOISE].
L:  Right.
R:  When people started sneezing and coughing.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, telling what they was eating, you know? [NOISE]
L:  Exactly.
R:  [NOISE] They say it came through food, but this was in the air.
L:  Mm.
R:  [NOISE] So ...  You never know [NOISE].
L:  No, you don't.
R:  Mm, mm. [NOISE]
L:  You just don't know.
R:  Mhm [NOISE].
L:  So, er, well, hopefully the improvements --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they have made in the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the step up in security is going to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just, er, buy us, er, some time that --
R:  [NOISE] A little more time [LAUGH].
L:  Exactly.  From -- 
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- safety, and what not, and, er --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, I don't know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- what's going to happen.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I just know that, um, personal opinion --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we need to keep our eyes on guard.  The whole nation --
R:  You got it.
L:  -- does.
R:  You got to be aware [NOISE].
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] Gotta start on guard and pray and keep God first in your life, and ...
L:  Exactly.
R:  That's all [NOISE] we can do, you know.
L:  Exactly.  Uh-huh.  
R:  He'll probably spare a few and take a few with Him.  That's all we know. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Only thing we can do is just to pray [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  That's the truth.
R:  [NOISE]  Mhm.  Yes [NOISE].
L:  Well 
R:  Well 
L:  Hm.  Have you -- you -- so you've traveled since nine eleven? 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I take it?
R:  Yeah [NOISE].  Ahah. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  Okay.
R:  And was lost on the first time because, you know [NOISE], they had a line, [NOISE] um, back around the corner of the street, [NOISE] --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- because they were so scared [LAUGH].
L:  Really?  Where -- where do you live?
R:  I live in Atlanta.
L:  Atlanta?
R:  Georgia.  Mhm.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm in Southern California.
R:  Oh, you are?  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  And I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I -- right after nine eleven I traveled, um, from Ontario --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- California, to Sacramento, so I was a little --
R:  Oh, okay [NOISE]
L:  -- nervous about traveling to the -- to the capital.
R:  [NOISE] I know you were.
L:  -- of our state.  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  So, I just thought, "Uh-hum, you know --"
R:  That's right [LAUGH].
L:  "-- I am little skittish"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I just had to -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- pray, and say, "You know what Lord?"  
R:  Mm.
L:  "Take this fear away from me.  This is --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- not of you".
R:  Yeah.  
L:  And --
R:  You have to pray, regardless if [NOISE] you ride, or driving, or, whatever, you got to pray.
L:  Exactly.
R:  A- -- anyway you go, it doesn't matter --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it can happen on the ground, in the air, wherever you going.
L:  Right.  And if he's ready --
R:  And if not, then --
L:  -- for me.  
R:  -- [several inaudible words] so, you know, that's it [LAUGH].
L:  Exactly.
R:  Mhm [NOISE].
L:  If it's my time, it's my time.  I am not --
R:  Yeah [NOISE].  
L:  -- gonna --
R:  It's the only way we can do it. 
L:  -- I can't worry myself out of it [LAUGH].
R:  If you sit up there any worry, you know.
L:  Exactly.
R:  You sure will [NOISE].  Mhm.
L:  And, um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- have you done any of these, er -- any other of these phone calls, er, study calls?
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yes.  I've did about four [NOISE]. 
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, that's cool.
R:  [NOISE] So, how many have you done?
L:  Um.  I think I've done three.  I think --
R:  [NOISE] Okay.
L:  -- I think this was actually my third --
R:  Mhm.  Mm.
L:  -- my third one, and I actually initiated one myself, 'cause I --
R:  Oh, you did!
L:  -- I got an email.  Uh-huh.
R:  Ahah [NOISE].
L:  So I went to their website and they said you can initiate a call by calling this eight hundred number and I did that and somebody else --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- was able to talk --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- [NOISE] at that time --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [NOISE] so I -- performed the call then, but I haven't gotten --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- paid for them yet.
R:  Ahah.
L:  Which I thought was kind of interesting.  It's been a while.
R:  Mm.
L:  My daughter, she's, er, eighteen.  She's gotten --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a check from them --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- since --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- this -- they started.
R:  Mhm [NOISE].  Mm.
L:  Anyway.  It's been interesting.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  I hope they're -- I hope they're getting a lot of good information.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I hope so too, but --
L:  I --
R:  -- er.  I like it, you know, so I said I was gonna start calling them and getting, er, the website address so I can go on [NOISE] the computer and, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- website the numbers the number on to them, you know, email [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and see if I can do some of [NOISE] the same from there also [NOISE], once I get my computer together [NOISE].
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  Huh.  Interesting.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.  But it was nice [NOISE] talking with you, and I enjoyed [NOISE] it and hope you enjoyed --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- my conversation.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Absolutely!
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And what was your first name again?
R:  [NOISE] Wauneta.
L:  Wauneta.  That's right.  Wauneta.  Bethany.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.  Right.
L:  All right.  Well, you take care, and, er, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'm thinking ten minutes is about up, don't you?
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.  Ye- --
L:  Mm.
R:  [NOISE] Yes.  I think so.
