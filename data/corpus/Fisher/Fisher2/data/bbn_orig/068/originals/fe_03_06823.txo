R:  Um, my name is Sarah.  [NOISE] And you?
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Hello.
L:  H- -- hi.  I'm sorry --
R:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] 
L:  -- I think my -- something is wrong with my connection, I think.
R:  Is it really?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I -- my cellphone has full signal but every now --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- like every third syllable or so --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- is kinda shaky.
R:  Oh, no.  [LIPSMACK] Well, hopefully --
L:  W- --
R:  -- hopefully we've sound for like done this. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. Uh-huh.
R:  Ok- --
L:  Please cell phone don't die. 
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, oh please don't.  [SIGH] Um, I'm sorry, my name is Sarah.  What was yours?
L:  I'm Anna.
R:  Anna?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Nice to meet you.  Where are you calling from?
L:  I'm calling from Washington --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- DC.
R:  Oh, wow.  I'm up in New York City.
L:  Oh.  
R:  [MN] 
L:  Fancy.
R:  Yeah.  Bit away.  
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  Okay.  My goodness, we have professional athletes tonight. [LAUGH] 
L:  Exciting topic [LAUGH] 
R:  Isn't it though?  For a whole ten minutes.  [SIGH] No, they do not --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- deserve those high salaries.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  We do, don't we?  [SIGH] [MN] 
L:  I totally agree with that.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  No, I don't think so -- uh, these athletes deserve these ridiculous high salaries.  But I don't understand most of sports culture anyway. 
R:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] I don't either.  I don't either.
L:  I mean --
R:  I mean --
L:  -- I -- I do like watching football sometimes but 
R:  Mhm.
L:  I like watching college ball really --
R:  Yeah.  That is enjoyable.  That is enjoyable.  I --
L:  -- and even, not even that too much.  You don't want to overload --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you don't want to over do the football.
R:  Mm.  Mm.  I don't really enjoy football as much.  Oh, I mean I like baseball.
L:  Baseball's fun.
R:  I like basketball, um --
L:  Another lovely [MN] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- all of these things really I feel like you get more out of it --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- if you play it.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.  Mhm.  [SIGH] I mean, I -- I -- they are highly skilled.  Don't get me wrong.  I could not do what they do -- 
L:  Oh ab- --
R:  -- at all.
L:  -- -lutely not.
R:  At all. [LAUGH] I couldn't even try [SIGH] if it was a million dollars, myself.  You know that million dollar shot they do? [SIGH] 
L:  Oh yeah.  No.  I'd blow that one in --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- one hot minute.
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] I could train forever, day and night, and I couldn't do it myself but um, [SIGH] I mean, the strike.  I mean, what are they striking for?  They're not striking for world hunger.  You know? [LAUGH] 
L:  I- -- no they're striking for better terms and salaries and I just -- as far as I'm concerned, I don't want professional athletes do it for charity.  I mean uh, it is your profession and they are professionals.  That's --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- why they call them pros.  [inaudible] 
R:  But I mean, c'mon.  How much are they getting?  Millions upon millions upon millions of dollars?  C'mon now.
L:  Yeah, I think with their salaries should come mandatory financial planning classes.
R:  I -- I think -- [LAUGH] right.  And a cap.  Seriously.  A cap. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I understand that the free market -- I mean, obviously we'll pay for it --
R:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] 
L:  -- so, there you go.
R:  Seriously.  Mm mm.
L:  But that, just to me, makes me think people are stupid.
R:  Ahah, ahah.
L:  And I'm all --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and it sounds just like, "Well, you know if you can strike for another fourteen billion dollars --"
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  "-- and we're idiots enough to pay you for it --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- sure, whatever". 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  "I won't be personally attending any of your games".
R:  I mean, I literally live two stops away from Yankee Stadium.  Two -- two stops.
L:  [MN]
R:  I come home from work and school and you should see the trains jam packed with Yankee fans.
L:  Oh, you should --
R:  Jam packed.
L:  -- come to a Capitals game.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  A hockey team in DC.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh my goodness.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  With the loud and yelling and --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- lots of beer drinking goes on, I think. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] No, don't get me wrong.  I want to go to a Yankee game but I mean, the salaries.  Oh my gosh.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  See?  
L:  Like I think -- 
R:  That's about all I can get out of them. [LAUGH] 
L:  I've been to one pro football game in my life.  I went to see a Redskins game 'cause a friend had tickets --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I would never -- I mean, they cost something like --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- you know, seventy dollars --
R:  Mhm.  I think --
L:  -- to go --
R:  -- professionally 
L:  -- n- -- not for a good seat.
R:  No.
L:  A lousy seat.
R:  [SIGH] I had box tickets complimentary when I was younger, of um a friend of a friend, you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, for a Mets game once.  I think that's all I've ever been too. [LAUGH] [SIGH] Ever.
L:  I would -- I might go to one because I love the spirit of it.  I like --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- going out -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and rooting.  I mean --
R:  Going to them.  I can't watch it on TV.  I can't.  I'm -- I just can't get into it.
L:  I think it's m- -- much more [several inaudible words] like [several inaudible words] TV [inaudible] gathering together to watch it and -- 
R:  Yeah, that's fun.
L:  -- really having conversation -- 
R:  That's fun.
L:  -- about something else.
R:  Mhm.  That means the socialization of it but [SIGH] 
L:  Right and chips and -- and dip and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- things abound.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.
L:  But [MN] again, you know, if -- if we all got to do that over --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- watching --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- the break- [inaudible] we'd probably be just as happy.
R:  You could be watching anything.  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Anything at all, but the actual sport of it -- and they're out there getting paid millions to do it.
L:  Yeah, well the prob- -- the thing i- -- problem with --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- caps is that first off where do you set it?  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I wonder like if you set it low would it really drive these people away?  'Cause I -- I still have a sort of romantic idea that you know, athletes play for the love of the game, to prove themselves and it's almost a very patriotic --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and spiritual --
R:  Mm 
L:  -- thing.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  Which, you know --
R:  I mean my husband -- my husband, he wanted to be a pro football player and I mean, he's built for it.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  He's just --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- physically --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- built for it.  [LIPSMACK] And I don't know, I almost want to go in the living room and ask him just you know, "Is it -- is it for the love of the game?  Is it for the money?"  [SIGH] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I dunno.
L:  Well, what did he -n -- I mean, why -- why did he not do that?
R:  Um.  [LIPSMACK] I dunno.  [LAUGH] I guess I might as well go into the living room and ask him, I mean. [SIGH] 
L:  [MN] Poke, poke, poke.  "Honey".  [LAUGH]
R:  Honey.  [LAUGH] No. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  He's into the movie.  But yeah.  [LIPSMACK] I dunno.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's very strange.
L:  I mean, maybe if I understood more about it.  I mean --
R:  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  -- [several inaudible words] gigantic machine because you can't [inaudible] athletes --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and the people who come watch them if --
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  -- athletes and the successful[?] teams and the owners of the management and [several inaudible words] and you know there's a million things and I don't --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- feel like -- [NOISE] you know I don't think --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the owners would be [several inaudible words] --
R:  No, I know.
L:  -- but it is.
R:  It's so weird.
L:  -- unbelievable [several inaudible words] 
R:  It -- it surely is unbelievable.
L:  Huh.
R:  And the money that they're making --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- on a daily basis.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I so much feel like, [NOISE] you know if we were to be the paying down the national debt.  [NOISE] If we were to be financing [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [NOISE] soup for hungry un- [inaudible] 
R:  [NOISE] Seriously.
L:  I could [several inaudible words] social issues that I think are more important than football.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And this is without going on the internet.  This is right off the top of my head.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I know.  I know.  There's so many issues that I could bring up, just off the top of my head. [LIPSMACK]
L:  [NOISE] And the frightening thing is --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- like one person's salary could do --
R:  One person's salary.  How many things that could take care of.
L:  That's it. [NOISE] 
R:  That is so true.  [NOISE] That is so very true.
L:  [NOISE] I mean like, almo- -- almost any profession -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- like, you know I have the same problem with sort of the CEO --
R: [NOISE] 
L:  -- benefits packages.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.  They're [inaudible] [NOISE] 
L:  They're on top of a two million dollar salary.
R:  Not even a salary.  Just the 401K plans and the retirement funds [LAUGH] alone.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  What they could take care of. [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] 
L:  [MN] They also get the company Lear jet.  What?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  For one thing do the per- -- one person use a Lear jet enough to --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- warrant buying it?
R:  No, it just sits there on the pilot's salary -- [LAUGH] alone. [NOISE] 
L:  Exactly.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  You know, I --
R:  The pilot's salary alone. [NOISE] 
L:  There's something like immoral about that to me.
R:  It's extremely immoral. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I don't know.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  [NOISE] The whole thing is like -- professional athletes being role models as well I find kind of strange.
R:  [SIGH] Mm.  There's [NOISE] another topic.
L:  Well, it's sort of, I want them to be, in the same sense that I have the same, like you know, --
R:  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  -- American idealism -- 
R:  That they're clean cut, yeah, an- --
L:  -- go team.  Ra, ra, ra.  On the other hand, they're professional and they have private lives and it's really none of our business.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Really it's not. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.  [SIGH] I mean the positive -- the positive ones that aren't out there you know, crashing cars and partying it up, but [SIGH] [NOISE] 
L:  [MN] An- [MN] I suppose that I love it --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- but I don't think we can make them be that.
R:  Mhm.  I mean, to each their own, but 
L:  [NOISE] Right.  I mean those are the athletes that I like, you know?  When I have kids I guess I -- 'cause I haven't got any just yet but [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- well, I'll take them to go see those athletes and if they want [inaudible] you know, life size --
R:  Those are the ones that you want to get.
L:  -- whatever --
R:  Push them towards.
L:  -- that sort of thing.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Exactly.
L:  Suppose they'll have lousy taste.  
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] But --
R:  Goodness.
L:  -- I don't know, all the like -- who is that?  Is it Iverson?
R:  Ah, Allen Iverson.  Yep.  I've got my son.  [LAUGH] He's blasted with Allen. [SIGH]
L:  Ah, yeah well 
R:  Are you against him?
L:  Well, it's is like he parties it up and --
R:  He is a partier. [LAUGH]  I know and I've got him blasted. [SIGH] 
L:  -- is terribly irresponsible. [LIPSMACK]  It's just that the really, really young ones -- like I feel like when you're a grown up really --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you can make these decisions more, but --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- when it's eighteen year old kids --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- getting into it.  Like a part of it I'm thinking, "Where are their parents --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- looking out for their money and looking out for their -- them behaving themselves?"
R:  Exactly. [NOISE] 
L:  Just because you're wildly talented, doesn't exempt [several inaudible words] 
R:  That's ver- -- mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's very true.  That's very true.  'Cause he is out there.  [NOISE] 
L:  Oh?
R:  He -- he -- no.  He really is out there, when I think of Allen Iverson.  [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, yeah.  I w- --
R:  I mean he's a -- in early twenties but still. 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  His PR person could be doing a little [LAUGH] bit better. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Who is [inaudible] who stars in --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- those commercials --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- where he's like, "I don't need anybody's help.  I'm doing it --"
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  "-- by myself 'cause I'm a big bad ass".
R:  Mm something like that, yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  It's on some soft drink commercial.  But the -- just the [inaudible] --
