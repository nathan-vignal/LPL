L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Hello. [MN]
L:  Hello.  U- -- d- you, er, ah [MN] -- I'm putting Jennifer on this phone now, okay? [NOISE] 
R:  Pardon me?
L:  Hold on. [NOISE] 
R:  Okay.
L:  [NOISE] Jennifer, your study, and the topic of the day [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- was, uh, professional athletes.
R:  [NOISE] Sh.  Um --
L:  Okay.
R:  Hello.
L:  [NOISE] Hello.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Honey, turn down the volume.
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  [NOISE] I won't be able to hear you [NOISE] otherwise. [NOISE] Okay, professional athletes.
R:  It sounds like a little one.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, there's little ones in the [NOISE] background too, [NOISE] yes. [NOISE] 
R:  Ah 
L:  [NOISE] Okay, so the topic --
R:  [NOISE] 
L: -- of the day is --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- is professional athletes? [NOISE] 
R:  It's athletes and their high salaries.
L:  [NOISE] Okay.
R:  And living in Arizona with the Arizona [LAUGH] Diamond Backs -- they should all take a pay cut right now. [LAUGH] By the way, my name is Carolyn. [SIGH] 
L:  [NOISE] And I'm Jen. [NOISE] 
R:  Hi Jen.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  And where are you from?
L:  [NOISE] Reading, Pennsylvania.
R:  Reading?  Oh, I know it well.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, we used to live in --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- New York and we --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- would go down [SIGH] -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- shopping! [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] That's great.  You can go out and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- get all those good deals without any problems.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Ah -- yeah, I think that athletes these days are paid way, way, way, way --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- way too much.
L:  They are paid a lot, yes. 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  They -- they -- [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they're paid so bad they're having strikes every so often. [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Especially the baseball -- [NOISE] 
R:  Er, right. [NOISE] 
L:  -- they're having strikes. [NOISE] 
R:  That's right.
L:  Yeah, like -- like the baseball strike. [NOISE] 
R:  R- -- I -- I -- I remember the -- the first -- first baseball strike, I gave up --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- baseball [NOISE] and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I was living in New York and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I was a Mets fan.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  And then when I finally moved --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- back here to Arizona --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and the Diamond Backs --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- came up I said -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  "-- "Okay, that's a brand new team, they --"
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  "-- weren't involved, I'll give it a try".  And that's when I went back to baseball, but if they --" 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- ever had another strike -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they would never see me again.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  They do say they pay lots of money. [NOISE] [MN] Especially [NOISE] -- there are a few choice players --
R:  Right.
L:  -- yeah, [NOISE] the -- the ones [NOISE] here they call best athletes. [NOISE] 
R:  Right.
L:   Like I don- [NOISE] -- I think like Donovan McNab just signed on for [NOISE] like a multi mi- million dollar deal for like seven years --
R:  Right.
L:  -- for example. [NOISE] 
R:  Well, what about this young kid --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- coming out of high school that's going into basketball? 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  He hasn't thrown a ball on an NBA --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- court yet and Nike is giving him nine million dollars. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, they say it was a b- --
R:  Ninety -- ninety millions.  Excuse me.
L:  Yeah, they said that was the second biggest [NOISE] award ever [NOISE] th- it was the second highest.
R:  [MN] 
L:  I think the only person who got higher it think was maybe Michael Jordan.  I'm not positive. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, [LIPSMACK] but I mean, he hasn't played a single game yet.
L:  That is true.
R:  That is ridiculous.  And -- and then you have, like on my team -- on my baseball team here you've got all these high priced players --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and then they'll get injured like -- like Randy Johnson just did this --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- new, you know, big contract, and then he got something wrong with his knee and now he's not playing.  Well, he's still getting his money.
L:  Yeah, most of it anyways.
R:  Yeah, so I mean, they should be paid based on their production.  On what they do for you.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.  A nine or a ten year -- you know, eight, nine, ten year contract.  You don't know what's gonna happen th- -- to them down the line.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I get very vociferous over this. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.  A lot of these players like long contracts.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I know um, the one --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the one player I know -- and that's because he didn't get a long enough contract --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah and -- and [SIGH] -- 
L:  -- he said he -- he said he wanted a four ye- -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I think he wanted a four year --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- contract.  They only offered him a three year, so he said --
R:  Y- right.  Right.
L:  "See ya.  I'll play for somebody else who'll give me more money".
R:  [SIGH] And look at -- and look at A. Rod- -- you know, um [MN] Rodriguez on -- on Te- -- on Texas -- [SIGH] ah, I mean the -- the team that didn't do anything last year, with -- with his big huge hundred million dollar contract.  The team was in the cellar.
L:  Yeah.
R:  If you can't produce --
L:  Well --
R:  -- why are you being paid?
L:  -- well, he said --well, his problem is, he claims he's the only good player in that whole -- [MN] on a -- on a bad team and one person 
R:  So, what did he stay there for then? [LAUGH] 
L:  Well it's all -- [MN] well, they gave him so much money he decided, ah hey --
R:  [MN] Ah.
L:  -- he'd go there anyway.
R:  [NOISE] You know, the thing is it's a game.  They're all games.  How in Heaven's name can you equate a teacher who's teaching math to kids and -- our kids and equate that to a guy who plays a game?  When these poor teachers can't get [SIGH] bob kits[?].  You know?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] I think that's ridiculous.  I think that's absolutely ridiculous.  But unfortunately [NOISE] I like baseball [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, I thi- --
R:  -- so I still follow 'em.
L:  Yeah, the main problem is that there's a few key --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- players that seem to get all --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the m- -- most of the money.
R:  Right.  It --
L:  Like, you know like -- basically like -bout half the team --
R:  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  -- makes you know, average money --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Sure.
L:  -- and then th- -- like they -- yeah like maybe the key four players or whatever -- 
R:  [NOISE] That's right.
L:  -- you know, the ones that are high competition, they get the multi million dollar deals.
R:  That's right.  And it's not spread out ev- --ah, you know, fairly --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and -- and it gives -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- no incentive -- you know, if you want to pay me, in baseball whatever you want to pay me -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- nine million dollars -- fine.  [SIGH] I'll get --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- three million if I -- if half -- in -- if the first half of the year I've done everything I'm supposed to do, then you can give me another three and if we win the League you can give me another three and then, at the end, if we win the World Series you give me the whole nine -- nine mill.  You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  But ah, I mean some of these players, they're just sitting there and they're just taking the money and they're doing nothing. 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I know some get paid per game they're in but I --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- yeah, but that's about it.  I don't think any of them --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- get -- they ah -- I think it's rare that you have to get a set of bonuses --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to pay them, depending on how long --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they play.
R:  Right.
L:  Though there might be one or two that do. [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] Well, I tell you --
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- if you look at it these days and you see, you know, some of these players that really -- really aren't producing and they're still collecting that, ah -- that uh salary that they were you know, [MN] given three years ago on a five year contract --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they're doing nothing, it's ridiculous.
L:  Yeah.  Unfortunately half of them claim it's the rest of the team's fault. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  They say, "Well, unfortunately --"
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  "-- one key player -- one good player on a -- on a bad team --"
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  "-- unfortunately cannot win the game alone".
R:  That's right.  That's right.  So, maybe the key player should pay attention to where he -- where he's -- he is signing --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and -- and not just sit back, you know, and not just sit back and say, "I'm just gonna take the money".
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  In the old days they didn't do that.
L:  That is true.  Tha- that's --
R:  They [MN] you know, they played for the love of the game and, actually, they were -- you know, they were literally owned completely and just could be sent and everything.  [SIGH] They're lucky at this point that that changed --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, and that they can make better money but they shouldn't be greedy.  And I think some of it is really just being greedy.
L:  That is true.
R:  Mm.
L:  I know -- I think what is it, baseball, or some of the others have a -- [NOISE] [MN] -- price caps, at least on how much money they can pay per season.  I'm not sure --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- if it's per player though.
R:  Right. [NOISE] 
L:  Because sometimes they're saying --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- well, you know players are capped per team and then they're saying well they're telling all these other players like -- I think some like the Eagles are saying they have a price cap --
R:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  -- on how much you can spend per year.  So, we're telling all these other players that [NOISE] because they've paid I think -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- Donovan McNab a ton oh money. 
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH] They're talk- --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  "-- they're telling everybody else, "Well, I'm sorry I can't --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- give you quite as much.  We had to give him, uh, this huge deal to keep him here --" 
R:  [MN] 
L:  "-- so I'm sorry, we can only spend this much money --" 
R:  [MN] That's right.
L:  "-- so I'm sorry but everybody else gets a lower thing".
R:  [NOISE] And how does that make the other players feel?  You know?  I mean, what kind of -- of team spirit are you going to get if hey 'cau- y- -- 'cause you're getting ninety million or whatever, I can't -- you know, I can't get even two million.  You know?  How th- -- how d- -- how can they feel?  I can't see how you can get a camaraderie and a spirit and -- and -- and a real team feeling [SIGH] when you have these two or three, ah, you know, unbelievable salaries and everybody else has to -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- suffer from that.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  You know?
L:  Well.  Mhm.  Yeah, [MN] other -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  One of the other problems that people say --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that unfortunately what it means is that you can get --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- help -- somehow get a team that has a lot of money somehow that -- that --
R:  Like the Yankees.
L:  -- that, y- know, they can have a good team --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- just because they have a lot of money --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- whereas another team that unfortunately does not have very much money --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- unfortunately --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they're stuck with a [NOISE] bad team --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [NOISE] because they can't afford to hit [NOISE] -- you know, to hire a --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the high [NOISE] -- key players because --
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- they all say, "Well, I want the h- -- huge salary.  You don't have the huge salaries so --" 
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- unfortunately, [NOISE] I'm going somewhere else". [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] Right.  Well, that's part of what, you know, th- -- the -- the ah, major league baseball was trying to put [NOISE] some kind of a salary cap or, you know -- I mean a cap on the team.  But --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if the -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- if the managers and the owners still want to give ni- -- [NOISE].  Hello.
L:  Hello, I'm still here. [NOISE] 
R:  Okay -- uh, want to give ninety percent of that money to one person [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] I guess that's their choice. [NOISE] I guess that's their choice.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  You wanna 
L:  Yeah, unfortunately it also raises the ticket prices too I'm sure.
R:  Oh.  Definitely.  You know the --
L:  'Cause think of all the prices -- 
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- how more expensive they are now.  It's like they're all -- 
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- they're like, you know, getting real high now. [NOISE] 
R:  Oh sure.  And I'll never forget the -- the second year after the Diamond Backs started, [SIGH] on Fan Appreciation Day, they raised [LAUGH] the ticket prices.
L:  On that day?  That's [MN] -- 
R:  On Fan Appreciation Day they announced that -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- next year the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- prices were going up.  I tell you [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [NOISE] Seems like a --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Seems like a dumb [MN] time to [MN] -nounce it.
R:  [SIGH] That was -- that was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- well, [MN] believe me they heard about it. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  They really did hear about it. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH] But it's been fun having a new baseball team here in -- in -- in Phoenix but, uh, [SIGH] of course [LAUGH] we're not doing so well right now [LAUGH] and the problem -- part of the problem is all [LIPSMACK] -- all of our big priced players are out injured.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] And so [MN] the money, to me, is going nowhere.  [NOISE] Absolutely nowhere, 'cause they're still getting their money.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They really are.  And uh --
