L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, this is Alicia.
R:  Hi, my name is Melissa.
L:  Okay, so --
R:  Um --
L:  Yeah -- go ahead.
R:  The topic is airport security.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Oh, that's weird, last time I had two diff- -- we had two -- two different topics.  Um, yeah.  How do you think it's changed?
L:  Um, I'm really not -- no, I was going to say impressed, but I don't -- that didn't really sound right.  I don't -- I don't really think it makes a difference at all.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  I mean --
R:  Longer lines, I think um, there are longer lines, more --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's not as expedient as it usually is.  Um, it's more of a headache I think, now.
L:  Yeah.  I haven't really been to the airport recently, but I mean, like, after September eleven, I was going -- I was going to New York from Houston, um, it was the beginning of October, so it hadn't really been that long, and I don't know, the -- it just wasn't a very big deal.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Except, um, the New York Airport was completely empty of, like, regular, you know, just people sitting around and my sister was saying that that wasn't really normal.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So I guess that's made a difference, but I mean, I don't really feel like it's any more secure.
R:  Are you in Houston right now?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh okay.  I'm in New York right now, so that's weird.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Um, but I mean, like, if a terrorist wants to get something done, they'll get it done.  You know?
R:  Yeah, but, I don't know, but in terms of, like, ah, the airport security system right now --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I think it's definitely, like, overhauled -- they've overhauled the system but, just like you said, um, sorry, in essence I don't think anything has really, really changed, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if something bad's going to happen, it's still going to happen.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, as far as, like, serious threats go --
R:  There are definitely --
L:  -- but I mean, like if there's just some regular guy that's trying to hawk in with guns for some reason, I think they'll get him, but, I mean, I think they would have gotten him before anyway.
R:  Yeah, there are definitely ways to circumvent the system now.  But I mean, in terms of like, the ridiculous things that they do now, they, like, make you take off your shoes and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- airport security is not only tighter but it almost seems like it's a waste of time and, like, taxpayers dollars.
L:  Yeah, money.  I -- I think that money can definitely go somewhere else.  I mean, like, I don't know, money being spent to ah, get some woman to take off her [inaudible].
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's crazy.
R:  That's pretty sure.  I mean, it makes you aware really.  They make you just waste time and it's just, like, you have to get there two and a half hours now before your flight leaves, even on a domestic flight.  That's kind of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ridiculous, and like, I don't know, personally I think it probably helps like, the economy because when you're bored, and I mean, it helps, like, the airport --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like, you know, commerce in the airport because when you're bored what else are you going to do, just, like, either buy a book or, you know, it encourages um, people -- passengers, like, to spend more money within the airport if they have to be there for longer periods of time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So.  Not that I'm saying it's a conspiracy, but, you know [LAUGH] it's like -- kind of like, just, it seems like a waste of effort.
L:  It does.  And, like, okay, did you ever see [inaudible]
R:  Yeah.  
L:  That part where he got on the plane and he says, "Bomb!" and, like, it's s- -- it seemed so ridiculous, but really, that's pretty true. [LAUGH] Like, if you say bomb you're in trouble.
R:  Yeah, definitely.  I know that -- it kind of was like that before, but I guess now it's even worse.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, like, I mean, also um, I don't know, it's sort of leads open to a lot of, like, I think open legal issues I would think, because [COUGH] now anyone can like, you know, I mean, flight attendants can say that they're suspicious of -- of anyone, really --
L:  Yeah, and they'll totally buy it.
R:  Yeah, definitely, and that's kind of, like, it seems discriminatory to me.
L:  Yeah.  It's just like anything can happen, really.  It can be abused in so many ways.
R:  Yeah.  It feels like the real effort -- real effort's not really being made.
L:  Yeah.
R:  From other people, I don't know.  I -- w- -- well, I guess we can only assess as far as like, passengers go.  We don't really know how it goes with, like, people who actually work in the airlines, too, because, I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they should be -- you know, they should also have, like, you know, just as stringent um, security clearance and stuff.
L:  Yeah, but then do you think that, like, airport security is really to um, like, how other airlines are doing this?
R:  Oh definitely, of course.  I mean, I think that the fact that they have so much more -- so many more costs, because security costs have gone up from, like, hiring people who are actually more adept at, like, you know, resolving these sort of issues and people who actually know what they're doing.  Well, I mean, they really -- they really don't know, that's kind of contradictory, but they really don't know what they're doing, but it seems like these people are more, you know, um, they go through, like, a more rigorous training process --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I guess it's like, airlines are, like, pouring money into that and they're pouring money into securing the cockpit of, like, the airline, or you know, giving like, I guess, um, these -- these flight attendants, like, more training in how to deal with like r- -- unr- -- I guess, really unruly passengers and stuff like that so, definitely --
L:  Yeah -- but -- then, like, shouldn't we feel more secure and want to fly more?  But I mean, nobody really wants to and prices, like, I -- I don't know, everyone says that they're supposed to be so cheap, but I was just looking at flights and they're expensive. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, well I mean, they're expensive for those kind of reasons because, like, I was saying, and that's something that you -- I don't really understand either.  To me that's completely bogus because it seems like they're operating just as much, you know, they're pr- -- they're discounting[?] their prices, it seems like September eleven has like, this such ugly impact on that.  You know, like, how -- you would think that things would be cheaper because they're -- they're flying ten[?] hours, like, okay, from any point like Houston to New York, I'm sure there're like four flights.  Like American Airlines, for example, has like, four flights leaving from Houston to New York, like, that's me estimating, you would think that because they have so many flights, like, everyday, that prices should be cheaper --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because there is like, so much more demand, like, you know, the whole supply and demand thing.  But I don't know, it just seems like prices are going up and you can't really understand why.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they're saying that these airlines are bankrupt and it's just, like, how can they be?  It seems like they have such a monopoly on the market sometimes or, ah 
L:  Well I mean, a flight in August would cost three hundred dollars from here to --
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  In -- in -- in August it would have been three hundred dollars?
L:  Yeah.
R:  God.  See, and like, some other -- at some other point -- I actually live in Lo- -- Louisiana --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I go to -- to -- to -- law school in Louisiana, and um, from there to New York sometimes you can fly -- fly for a hundred and fifty.
L:  Really?  On Jet Blue?
R:  On Jet Blue or on, even American Airlines, which is so weird.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But --
L:  That's crazy because my sister was telling me, "Well, if you could find a way to New Orleans just fly Jet Blue and that'll be super cheap", and I don't get that.  If Jet Blue can do it, why can't anyone else?  I mean --
R:  What about [inaudible] Did you try Fort -- Fort Worth?
L:  No.
R:  Because it's like a hub for American Airlines, I'm sure you can find cheap flights.
L:  I don't know -- but, I mean, I don't understand why from Houston to New York it should be like that or like, from airline to airline.
R:  I don't even understand that either. [LAUGH] It seems like they just arbitrarily determine whatever price they want, you know.
L:  Yeah.  I mean does Jet Blue not have the expensive security, or what?
R:  Oh no, you know with Jet Blue it's definitely like you're treated sort of like cattle, you don't really have a ticket --
L:  Oh really?
R:  -- you get like a little coupon, that's the problem.  Yeah, you get like, a coupon --
L:  And you just sit anywhere?
R:  It's some sort of like, receipt, you know, like in super markets?
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's what you get.  You don't really get like a -- an actual printed ticket.  I don't know if that really, like, makes a whole lot of difference.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I mean, I don't know, like --
L:  Do they have assigned seating?
R:  Y- -- I think you do have assigned seating but you don't know until you get there.
L:  Yeah.  And are they all flat rates?  Like, there's no first class or whatever.
R:  No, that's the best thing about Jet Blue is that at the very last, like, second, I mean, you know, you could buy your ticket up to, like, the day before the flight leaves and it's still the same price as if you had bought -- even if you had bought it like, a month in advance.
L:  Oh really?
R:  Whereas like, American Airlines you know, if you thought to buy it like, three months in advance it can be eighty dollars and if you buy it, like, the day before it's six hundred, you know.
L:  Oh, about the timing, yeah.
R:  It is about the timing.  But I -- I think it just depends.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I don't know.  That's about -- that's about it for airport security. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Airport security.
R:  We've exhausted the subject.
L:  Yeah.
R:  How did you find out about this program?
L:  Ah, my boyfriend.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, I don't know how you found it.
R:  Wow, as soon as you said Houston, I'm like, wow.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Because it's a study from, like, the University of Pennsylvania --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I don't know, like, people down south were friendly --
L:  [LAUGH] Down south.
R:  I live there!  It's okay. [LAUGH] 
L:  I know.
R:  I admit it. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
