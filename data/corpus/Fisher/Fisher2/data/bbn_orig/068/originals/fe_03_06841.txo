L:  Hi, I'm Susa- -- 
R:  Hi, --
L:  Hello, I'm Susan.
R:  [LAUGH]  Hi, I'm Rebecca.
L:  Hi Rebecca.  Nice to meet you.
R:  Nice to meet you too.  I'm pretty --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- new to this.  This is my first call so [LAUGH].
L:  Um, all it is, is this is my third, and I guess, last one.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, there is a topic and you just have to discuss it for, like, eight out of the ten minutes.
R:  Okay.  Sounds --
L:  So --
R:  -- easy [LAUGH].
L:  -- Okay, um, well do you think all this security is, um, [PAUSE] -- wh- what was that?  Heightened airport security will, um, -- what was that?  Cut down on terrorism, is that what it was at the time [LAUGH]?
R:  Yeah.  That -- that w- -- that was -- that was the gist of it [LAUGH].  Um, I think so.  I don- -- I can't really say that I think it will eliminate it because the terrorists are pretty up on what's going on in the airline industry and they do their homework and, so, you know, they -- they try to find ways to foil whatever they can.  But I imagine that the heightened security will at least reduce the incidents.  So, I g- -- I guess overall it's a good thing [LAUGH].
L:  Well, I -- I kinda have to wonder how much of it actually is -- is -- is really done.  I mean you hear about people getting kicked off because they think -- they get their fingernail clippers taken away.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I mean, it seems kind of lame that that's all [LAUGH] they can, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- kind of do.  And my nephew flies a lot wh- -- um, several times.  He lives in Alaska and he comes to visit us --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, he's gotten on an airplane where -- oh, my gosh!  Firecrackers.  [SIGH] You know, that someone gave him --
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  Um, his father's deceased so, like, my -- m- -- all of my husband's friends decided to become like father figures to them so they gave them stuff like, you know, firecrackers, penknives [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm [LAUGH].
L:  He's gotten on the airplane with -- with firecrackers!  I mean, which is kinda stupid.  How that -- you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and he, like, pulls them out of his -- didn't know he had them at the time and he stuck them in his pocket and forgot about them.  But he got on, I mean, and  -- you know, he's -- like penknives and I mean it's just almost kind of a joke sometimes what he's gotten on an airline with, and I don't know how it's happened.
R:  That's kinda scary [LAUGH].
L:  Y- -- exac- exactly! [LAUGH].
R:  Now, I -- I haven't flown since I think, nineteen ninety eight -- ninety seven --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- was the last time I flew.  And, you know, it wouldn't have ever occurred to me to think that people on my plane [SIGH] could have had knives and stuff like that on them, but I flew on a full plane to California and I bet somebody did. 
L:  Yeah.  I'm --
R:  And, er --
L:  -- sure they did.  Yeah.  When you think about it, it was -- it was kind of like before people, um, -- you know when they tainted all that Tylenol?
R:  Yeah.  I remember --
L:  Remember?
R:  -- that.
L:  And no one thought twice about you could get a -- buy a gallon of milk and just twist off the label.  You could buy pills a- -- you know, like, Tylenol and just open up the box and open up the pill.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and, without people doing that -- so, now it's like, you know, I guess, yeah, I guess it was pretty easy just to walk on an airplane [SIGH] and, you know, and -- and with two box cutters, you know, wreck all that havoc and terrible things.
R:  Yeah.  That's -- that's really scary.  It -- you know, something -- I mean, a box cutter's not really benign.  I've cut my -- I've cut myself with a box cutter before --
L:  Oh, they're incredibly sharp!
R:  But, you know, when --
L:  I mean, they're tiny --
R:  -- you -- when you look at the --
L:  -- they're low tech.
R:  -- when you look at fear factor, you don't tend to really fear a box knife that much.
L:  [LAUGH] Right, exactly!
R:  You know, that's something that we deal with in daily life and it's scary that they did what they did with box cutters.
L:  Oh, exactly!
R:  Something that -- something that -- well, I know we have them in our house.  My husband uses them all the time, in -- with his handyman work and stuff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, you know, I -- just about everybody I'm sure has one somewhere in their house. 
L:  Yeah, and, you know, they're cheap.  They cost what?  Twenty, thirty cents.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, they're just a piece of cheap, extremely sharp metal and it did all of that damage --
R:  W- -- maybe --
L:  -- and those guys just kinda waltzed on the plane.
R:  Maybe I should say that if the heightened air- -- s- -- air- -- airport security were being done properly [LAUGH] it would cut down on terrorism.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um 
L:  Yeah.  I would like to see, like sky marshals or, I -- you know, you don't hear much about that, putting sky marshals on the plane.
R:  Right [COUGH]
L:  And -- 
R:  -- I rememb- --
L:  -- I thought that would probably be the most effective thing.
R:  I remember for a while hearing about the -- that idea on the news and people did polls.  Some people wanted them, some people didn't, but I -- I don't know if they're actually doing it or not but we don't hear anything about it now.
L:  [SIGH] No, you don't, you know, so I wonder if maybe they just shelved that because of, um, of monetary concerns.
R:  Well, I -- I think September eleventh was a -- was a big monetary concern also.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  I mean, just in addition to the loss of life, that was a very expensive disaster.
L:  Oh, yes!
R:  And I think it would have -- if they wanted to save money they need to look at preventing things like that from happening. 
L:  Oh, exactly, exactly. 
R:  But, you know, it's -- it's easy to look back and say they should have done this and they should have done that, but in all the times that I've flown the only thing that I ever thought could possible happen is maybe the plane could crash sometime.
L:  Right!
R:  But, I still -- I loved flying and I was never afraid because I knew how slim the odds were. 
L:  Right.
R:  Um, [NOISE] but now, you know, when you get on a plane you've got a whole lot more to think about than just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "Could this plane crash?"
L:  Yeah, this -- this is true.  This is true.  Now, i- -- have you not flown just because of, you know, things -- of other reasons, or have you made a conscious decision not to fly?
R:  Um, I just haven't flown because I haven't had a reason to [LAUGH].
L:  Right.
R:  Haven't gone anywhere [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  Yeah, I know that feeling.
R:  Um, we're actually going on a cruise in October and we're leaving from New Orleans and -- I live in Oklahoma, so it's, you know, we -- we could fly -- it's kinda that -- that distance where you could fly or you could drive and we've chosen to drive because it will actually be cheaper for us to do that.  We have a --
L:  Right.
R:  -- we'll have a child with us too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] but we haven't -- I haven't -- that'll be the furthest I've gone from here since the last time [LAUGH] I flew.
L:  Mm, yeah [LAUGH].
R:  So, I don't kn- -- I don't think I would consciously decide not to fly because I was scared of -- scared of terrorism.  I think I would just be super, super cautious [SIGH].
L:  Right!
R:  And, er, I would -- you know, I used to walk onto a plane and sit down and just be ready to enjoy myself.  Um, I used to always enjoy flying.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I love the feeling of taking off and everything.  But, I think I would be a little more aware of my surroundings, a little more aware of the other people on the plane.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, and, there's also the fact that, ah, when you fly, I think a lot of people feel the responsibility now that -- that they need to be prepared to act in self defense, if they have to.
L:  You know, I think you're right.  I think you're right. 
R:  And, er --
L:  I'd never thought of that before, but I bet you are right.
R:  That -- that is something that [SIGH], especially if I ha- -- I have a two year old.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Especially if I had him with me.  I would be -- I would -- I would probably make sure I was prepared to do whatever I needed to do to defend myself if I were put in that position, before I would fly.  And, er --
L:  That's interesting.
R:  It's a scary thing to think about!
L:  Yeah!  Yeah.  
R:  But, er --
L:  W- well, do you feel like you would be prejudiced when you see people that may look like terrorists?  Which means, like, if they look mid eastern or Palestinian.  I mean, would you refuse to get on the plane?
R:  Um, I don't know that I would refuse to get on the plane but to be truthful, I probably would keep -- I would probably be extra aware of this.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I've -- you know, I've -- I've never really been that aware of people's race before, but it's -- it's really hard to ignore that.  I hate to say that, but it's really hard to ignore that when you see someone who looks Middle Eastern.  Sometimes, that's the first thing you wonder about.
L:  Right.
R:  And, er, I think I would just -- I wouldn't refuse to get on the plane but I think I'd just be extra aware.
L:  Yeah, that's interesting.  Yeah.  Well, do you -- I mean, do you think -- do you think the airlines -- they just put more people on their kind of flight[?] or do you think they've ma- really made an effort to cut down on sec- -- to -- to really be more secure?
R:  Well --
L:  I don't know if I've been to an airline -- I mean, you know, you can't -- there's places you can't go that you used to --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but I don't know whether it's -- it's just become a bigger pain in the butt but I don't know if it's any safer.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I know -- my brother is in the military, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he's in, Ok- -- Okinawa, Japan right now.  And, when his -- his family stayed here and when they went to see him off at the airport they couldn't go past the curb.
L:  Right.
R:  They -- they had to say their goodbyes at the curb instead of, you know, previously they would have been able to go and watch them take off even.
L:  Or, right at the k- -- yeah.
R:  And, er, you know, so, obviously they're -- obviously they've made some changes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I'm sure there have been others that I haven't seen because I haven't been in an air- -- an airport.  I haven't gone to fly.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, I've heard people complaining enough about the extra security.  They must be doing something [LAUGH]
L:  Yes [LAUGH].  Well, this is true.  Now, are y- -- you're not allowed to, like, do the sky cab thing.  You know how you used to be able to check of your luggage with the sky cab?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Are you not allowed to do that anymore?  Did those, like, poor guys get like put out of business?  Are you still allowed to drop off your bags at the curb, or now, you have to check them in and go stand in line?
R:  That's a good question.  I don't know.  Um, I never did that.  I always just checked in my own.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, -- and I haven't been to an airport to even notice.  Um, but -- but surely -- I mean, surely these changes are probably gonna be permanent so I -- I -- if they haven't gone out of business they surely will.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  It -- it's sad, but I -- I suspect that's the case.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you think they've actually, like, prevented anybody, I mean, foiled any attempts?
R:  [SIGH] Um.  I -- I don't know [LAUGH].  I don't know if they may have actually foiled any actual attempts, or, [SIGH] you know, there may be people who were thinking about doing something who decided not to because the
