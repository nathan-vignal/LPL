R:  Mhm.
L:  They are!
R:  The three oldest ones are at school.  My son is over at his grandma's house.  'Cause he's the only boy, so she likes boys more than girls anyway.

R:  She does -- and our baby is asleep.
L:  Now, I don't believe her one bit. [NOISE]
R:  Well, she has all boys -- three boys.  She said she don't like girls -- not even one bit.

R:  [LAUGH] Oh [LAUGH].
L:  I got married right out of high school, 'cause I didn't want to go away to college.  I got a full scholarship and got scared, so  [NOISE]
R:  Mhm. [LAUGH].
L:  I got married and passed up [NOISE] the scholarship and had two kids straight away, and [LAUGH] then divorced shortly after [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And then waited around and [NOISE] married the boy next door -- who I should have married in the first place [NOISE] [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] [MN]
L:  [MN] He's four years younger than me, so 
R:  Oh, God.

R:  Mhm.
L:  How do you manage time for yourself with five kids?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  'Cause I know I don't get any [LAUGH].
R:  For most of the time they stay gone.
L:  Ah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] 'Cause I just never have a moment's peace, it seems [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I go into the bathroom, take a shower.  It- -- it's five knocks on the door minimal [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.
L:  "Mom, where's my pants?" [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  That's how my husband is.

R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Oh, they jus- -- 
R:  Mm, mm, mm.
L:  -- they have a very limited time on it now.  When we first got it, that was all they wanted to do is play on it, and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- then my husband couldn't wait for them to go to bed so he could play by himself [LAUGH].
R:  Mm [LAUGH].
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH].  Yeah.  We got a golf game on there that him and I both enjoy playing together. [NOISE]
