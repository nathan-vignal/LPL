L:  Hi, my name is Barbara.
R:  Hi.  I'm Pat.
L:  And Pat, where are you?
R:  I live in Wisconsin.
L:  Oh.  Well, we're in New York.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well --
L:  And we have to talk about the conflict in the Middle East.
R:  That's quite a topic.
L:  It really is. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  I'm sure you have a lot to say on that.
L:  Well, I -- I don't know if I do or not.  I, um, I don't think it's ever going to be resolved.  I mean, it -- it seems like it's been going on for years and years, and --
R:  Right, right.  Yeah, it's sad too.  It's sad that, ah, we should have to -- to ah, suffer for such, um, terrible minded people, I guess is what I want to say.
L:  Yeah.  And -- and it -- and it seems like we have to get involved in everyone else's um, affairs and everyone else's wars and I don't un- -- quite understand why.
R:  Right.  I agree with you very much.
L:  But ah, [LAUGH] I guess to keep it from coming here, which ah, it didn't do too much on September eleventh, did it?
R:  No, right.
L:  So --
R:  But it could be worse, you know, we could get a lot more of it, so, you know, at least they know, I guess they -- they know our -- our theories and our stance and we don't want it any more, here, you know --
L:  Yeah. [COUGH] But all that suicide bombing, how do they -- how do they ever stop people from doing that?
R:  How do they even convince them to do that?  That's -- to me, that is so sad that they can take someone's mind --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and make them do something like that.
L:  Mhm --
R:  -- you know.
L:  -- and -- and young people that are impressionable, I guess they -- I can't -- I -- I guess I've never felt that strongly about a cause --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that I would want to give up my life for it --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- but um, who knows what happens in -- in other countries?
R:  Yeah.  Well I know, I -- we watch the History channel a lot --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and they had a thing not too long ago about Saddam Hus- -- ah, whatever his name --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I -- you know --
L:  You don't even like to say it, do you?
R:  -- right, and about -- about him and his sons, and you know, how they came into power and -- and some of the things that they've done.  And they showed pictures of, like, children and women and -- that they killed, just -- you know, it was just atrocious.
L:  Yeah.  There was something on um, where they -- well, that was Iranian women or -- or Iraqi women --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that they interviewed.
R:  Right.
L:  I don't know, was it on The View?  Or Barbara Walters had it, or something --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and the terrible things that they had done.  But um, in the Middle East, I -- I don't know if -- I don't if Arafat is, ah, responsible for a lot of that or if they got rid of him would it -- would it help?  I -- I just --
R:  I don't know.
L:  -- don't know.
R:  I don't either.
L:  How did you come to sign up for the Fisher?
R:  Ah, I do a lot of refunding.
L:  Oh, hey. [LAUGH] That -- me too.
R:  Okay.
L:  Since nineteen sixty nine. [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.  I've been -- I've been doing it a long time.  I was -- I read about it on the chat page --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- on Refund Makes Sense.
L:  That's -- me too.
R:  Oh, that's kind of cool.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know, and I had one other call, um, and then we were away for a while so I didn't have any others, but she too had been --
R:  Yep, me too, this is my second call --
L:  That's terrific --
R:  -- and the first one was on hobbies and I talked with a lady down in Florida --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and we had no problem at all talking about our refunding hobby.
L:  I -- I -- I had something about, um, if you were to start your own business, what would it be, and I --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I had really -- I had never, ever thought about it and -- and we were a few minutes into the conversation before I [LAUGH] finally came up with something, but --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- anyway, as far as the Middle East, I don't think we're ever going to solve that, you and me, huh? [LAUGH] 
R:  No, I guess not.  Um, as far as our country staying involved, you know, that's kind of a hard question.  Um, you know, as far as the government and -- but I don't know, I guess they feel they have to, ah, just try and keep us out of it, I guess --
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- although that didn't work either because our fellows were over there fighting, you know.
L:  Mhm.  Well, I mean, how many years ago was it that Sadat and, was it Begin?  Sat down and they -- they thought they had everything all solved and then somebody killed Sadat [LAUGH] and that was the end of that --
R:  Yeah [LAUGH] 
L:  -- in the Middle East, so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- yeah, so --
R:  It just kind of makes me m- -- more thankful that I was born and raised where I am in a -- in a country like this --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, when you think of how those people had to live.  Some of them, how they were tortured and -- and, you know, just killed for no reason at all, and it -- it makes you m- -- makes you thankful, you know.
L:  Yes, yes --
R:  It's just --
L:  -- but I-- I also resent the fact that there are so many people here that could benefit from all the money that we're spending to take care of other people --
R:  That's very true.
L:  -- you know, but um --
R:  -- that's very true.  Yes --
L:  but --
R:  -- you know, that's true.  Actually they should take care of our own country --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- before they w- -- yeah, they go and -- and bomb everything and then -- then they go and pay to have it rebuilt.
L:  Yes.  That's incredible, isn't it?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, does that -- does that make sense, huh?
L:  Yeah, and -- and all the stuff on the news tonight about the -- the Je- -- Jessica Lynch, you know, that was k- -- ah, rescued, the -- the soldier that was rescued --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- from the --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- yeah, and they're making it sound as if it was all staged, or um --
R:  Oh well, I didn't even see that --
L:  -- didn't happen the way -- oh yeah, it -- it's been on the news tonight --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I heard it -- I heard it --
R:  I didn't have the TV on.
L:  -- on the radio yesterday --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that they -- they wondered if ah, you know, that the Iraqis had left already by the time um, they went in to rescue her, and, I -- I don't know what they're trying to say --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but ah, they're trying to make it different from what we have been told, so --
R:  Oh really.
L:  -- but anyway, so --
R:  Oh.
L:  But -- well I enjoyed talking to you, and um, h- -- do you know how -- what happens with the -- I mean, you said this was your second call too --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- my first one was a g- -- a good two or three weeks ago, but then I've -- I've seen on line where you can initiate a call yourself.  Did you see that?
R:  Yeah.  No, I didn't do that.  My -- my first one was, maybe about eight days ago --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I know twice we were gone and there was like, a message on the answering machine --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I could tell it was from here and so I thought, well, I'll just wait and see and kind of even forgot about it until the phone rang --
L:  Yeah, well, I -- I go- -- yeah, I got the first one, like, the day after I signed up --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then -- then we went away and we just got home, um, Friday, and then this was my second one, so --
R:  Mhm, well I -- I didn't initiate any calls --
L:  No, I -- I haven't either, I just wondered if, you know --
R:  Yeah, I -- I feel I'll just let 'em, you know, give me my three calls and kind of go from there.  It's really kind of interesting.  I wasn't going to do it at first, then the more I read about it on the chat page --
L:  Yeah, I know --
R:  -- it sounded like, well this is kind of neat, you know, and then I thought well maybe it's closed already, but it was still open so --
L:  -- Mhm.
R:  -- kind of a --
L:  -- that -- that chat page is incredible.
R:  Oh, isn't that fun?
L:  Yeah, it was so much more so than -- I mean -- I subscribed to the magazine for years --
R:  Yeah, I do too.
L:  -- I don't know if you did?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and um, but -- but I've just forg- -- I haven't bothered with that any more because I enjoy the internet so much more.
R:  Yeah, I do too.
L:  Yeah, so --
R:  --spend a lot of time on there --
L:  -- too much time [LAUGH] for me. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- that's kind of cute.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know, ah, a lot of this stuff, you know, see I live in a very remote area, ah, way up in Northern Wisconsin --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- actually we're just a stone's throw away from Michigan, you know, it doesn't take long to get there, but -- but for me to go shopping where there's like, a Wal-Mart or anything, is a forty five minute drive.
L:  Really?  Oh.
R:  Yeah, so I miss out on a lot of the really good -- good neat deals that I read about --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but -- but I still learn a lot of -- you know, get a lot of good things to sign up --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- and little --
L:  Well we live fifty miles out of New York City, so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you know, we're out in the boonies.  We're -- we're closer to West Point.  We're kind of in that area.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Bear Mountain.  I don't know if you're familiar with any of that --
R:  No.
L:  -- but, um, we -- we -- we haven't had a Wal-Mart for terribly long, maybe four or five years, but it's ah, you know, only ten minutes or so from here, so, but, ah --
R:  Oh.  You weren't able to ah, see or hear any of that disaster, were you?
L:  No.  No.  I- -- in fact we ha- -- my son went down and saw the -- you know -- the -- the ruins [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but we haven't -- we haven't been down.  We haven't been to the city in I don't know when --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- even before that, we just -- I don't know, we're close enough that we could go any time, it's like a -- an hour train ride, but um --
R:  Uh-huh.  I think I kind of saw enough of it on TV.
L:  Really?  Yes.
R:  Where, I don't know if I'd want to go and see it.
L:  I -- I don't think I would.  I really don't.  And I don't know anyone who was, you know, personally involved --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I've heard a couple of um, near misses --
R:  Right.
L:  -- where someone, ah, was supposed to be there but their wife was having a baby so they weren't there that day.  You know, that kind of thing, so --
R:  Wow, yeah.  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but no one that -- that I know personally that was, ah --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- hurt
