L:  Hi, my name is May.
R:  Hi, I'm Linda from New Hampshire.
L:  Oh, I'm from Toronto, Canada.
R:  Oh, hi [LAUGH].
L:  We're talking about airport security?
R:  Yes. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] Okay.  I guess we'll have different points of view because I live in Canada and you live in the States.
R:  Mhm.  Well, [MN] I think it's an excellent idea after what happened down her.  Um 
L:  Have you flown much since, er, nine eleven?
R:  Yes.
L:  Have you noticed much of a change?
R:  [SIGH] Er, the first time I flew was, em, two months after.
L:  Oh, wow, okay.
R:  And, it was pretty tight.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [SIGH] The next time was, em, a year later.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, it loosened up a little, but not much.  Um, they were doing s- -- added things that they hadn't done even two months after.
L:  Oh, really?  Good.
R:  Right.
L:  Do you feel safe flying?
R:  Definitely.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  It never changed my opinion --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- on flying   Um, I don't think they would try again on flying, at least for a while [LAUGH].
L:  That's true, though they've got other -- probably other tricks up their --
R:  That's true. [NOISE] [MN]
L:  -- sleeves.
R:  [SIGH] Um, element of surprise --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is what they go on, [NOISE] so 
L:  For sure, yeah.
R:  And we're expecting airplanes so they're gonna take something else.
L:  Like boats, yeah.
R:  Right.
L:  But I find -- ah, the thing that is so irritating about, um, new airport security is that you have to be at the airport so much earlier.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And for a short haul flight, um, it's j- -- it's lot easier just to d- -- easier and cheaper just to drive.
R:  Yeah.  It -- yeah, it's about two hours ahead of time where it used to be an hour, you know.
L:  And if you're going -- like, for us to go to the States it can be even longer, 'cause it's called an international flight.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right, that's true, oh.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And you're not that far from the States either.
L:  Mm, mm, no.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I mean, don't need an airplane to get there, but --
R:  All right.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, [SIGH] what do they check for now [MN], like up in, um, Toronto? [MN]
L:  Um, actually I haven't flown for a little bit so I, um, -- the last time they were doing the, er, spot checks of people, em, with -- er, checking their shoes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, unfortunately, the m- -- person said, "The first person to board the plane gets checked", and I was the first person [LAUGH] to board the plane [LAUGH].
R:  [NOISE] Well, that's nice for them to tell you, who's --
L:  N- --
R:  -- getting checked [LAUGH].
L:  Well, no, after the fact, like I said, --
R:  Oh, after [LAUGH].
L:  -- "How do you choose [LAUGH] -- like, you know, how random was it?"  And they said, "Oh, the first person".  So, the moral of the story is don't be the first person to [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You know, I sat in the airport for, like, three hours.  Like, se- -- I think, "Well, if I'm the first person on the plane it'll go faster".
R:  Mm.
L:  But, not really.
R:  Mm [LAUGH].  Oh, well they were doing, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the spot checks when I went the last time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of every --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think it was every [NOISE] ten, twenty people.
L:  Oh, okay,
R:  And they -- or they would pull out certain people on the roster --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and call them up to the desk.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  At first we thought they were doing something bad but then we found out they [LAUGH] --
L:  When you were called up then [LAUGH] you knew it wasn't something bad.
R:  -- found out it was just a spot check.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH] and making sure you have all your paperwork right and -- they'd ask a few --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  questions --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and then they'd have you sit in an isolated area.
L:  Oh, okay [NOISE].
R:  Oh.  Which, I can understand totally.  The spot checks, I think, are better.  It's better than checking every single person.
L:  Well, you can't.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Which will take you a week [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  That's right 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And another thing I noticed, um, -- this was not me but was my niece who was flying on a ski trip and she said that, um, -- everyone got through, except this one person who was of middle eastern, or- -- um, origin.
R:  Mm.
L:  -- that happened to be their friend, so it- -- so, obvious- obviously they knew that -- like, he was part of their ski -- ski friends and he was not a terrorist, but that's how, you know, they decided to choose randomly people who look, um  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.
L:  As if 
R:  There's bad to that, yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm.  It signal- -- singling out somebody is wrong.
L:  Right, because --
R:  But [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I guess that's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- left up to the people on the plane, right.  The stewardess and pilot.
L:  Oh, I think th- -- no, this is like to check your shoes and all this stuff.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Like, instead of the first person, they just said, "Oh well, you look like as if you would have been [LAUGH] --
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  -- a terrorist.
R:  [LAUGH] Well 
L:  [NOISE] No, er, all I can say is, like, it's irritating to go to the airport, like, really early.
R:  Mm, mm.
L:  How far do you have to go to go to the airport? 
R:  We le- -- um, the airport's fifty miles from here.
L:  Oh, wow!  
R:  Mm, mm.
L:  That's far! [NOISE]  Oh [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  To me, to go to the airport it's like twenty minutes and I'm complaining, so --
R:  Ah.
L:  I guess [LAUGH] --
R:  But we g- -- we have to be there about two hours early.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, well, with the exception of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- our airport 'cause it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- relatively small --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- so you can get through a lot faster.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  We go to Orlando a lot --
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  -- which takes longer.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, how about from Orlando coming home?  How is that airport?
R:  The Orlando airport is --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it is a long time.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, really.
R:  When they're real strict.  Which, for some reason, I think they get stricter --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- right after something happens.  Then they get --
L:  Fair enough. [NOISE]
R:  -- a little -- either they get better at it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or, they lapse a little.  I'm not sure which [LAUGH].
L:  Okay.  Well, stands to reason [NOISE].
R:  Yes.  It could be they just got it down pat [LAUGH].
L:  Right.  Until the next, ah  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But, terrorists are gonna figure a loophole through most anything.
L:  Well, I live in Toronto, Canada, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we're not worried about terrorists.  We're worried about SARS and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and bad cattle and --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the Western Isle virus.  So that, I think, um, -- I actually -- since --
R:  [NOISE]
L: I'm not -- I don't have a trip planned until August when I'm going to see my sister.  The, um, -- the subject of airport security really has not -- I mean, ah, come to mind except for the phone call [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know.  I guess you have to prioritize, you know, what you're gonna be scared of, right?  
R:  [SIGH] You can-  -- yes.  A lot of people are still frightened.  They think --
L:  Oh, really? [MN]
R:  -- th- -- the terrorists are gonna take it over.  But 
L:  Ah.  They gon- -- I guess that they're gonna do something new.
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  I mean -- they're pretty inventive.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, now, do they check people on the SARS?  Does that affect anything to do with the airport, at all?
L:  Oh, yes -- yes, you're right, we can talk about it there, because we have -- theoretically, we have, um, thermal image screening --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so that when you walk past, um, this machine, um, [NOISE] the person, er, looks through the TV monitor and he sees, um, --
R:  Oh, if you're running a fever, or something?
L:  -- yeah. [NOISE]  Like if -- if you're s- -- so theoretically, if you're running a fever, er, um, [NOISE] it -- the image is like red or something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's a different color.  And, um, so you know, [MN] that would also add ex- -- you know, may extra time going to and from the airport.  I mean --
R:  Yeah, it does, yes.
L:  You know, so, by the time they check for terrorists, they check for shoes, they check for fevers [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They forgot what they checked for the first time.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, it's just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, no.  Things are just -- it's unreal.
R:  Mm. [NOISE]
L:  Is that your phone ringing?
R:  Yeah, it's my business phone.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  The answering machine will pick it up [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  Fair enough, yeah.  Um, it's funny like, in the past --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when you traveled, you just got on a plane, you didn't worry about who sat beside you, or --
R:  [NOISE] Right.  Mhm.
L:  But I remember one time --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, I think in February --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I sat beside someone and, evidently he was from Norway or somewhere and he jumped up and he ran to the front and, you know, I was thinking to myself, "Oh, my God --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- what's wrong with him?"  
R:  Mm.
L:  What he was seeing was, um, I think it was like a snowy, icy day and he was seeing smoke come out.
R:  Oh.
L:  And [NOISE] --
R:  -- and it frightened him?
L:  Yeah.  But then, him jumping up [LAUGH] to the stewardess at the front --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- made we wonder, "Mm, what's --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- going on with him?".  But, um, ah, he was told that, yeah, [NOISE] the steam was very, ah, -- was very normal, so don't -- [NOISE] don't be afraid of that. [NOISE]
R:  Mm.
L:  [NOISE] But yeah.  It doesn't pay to -- it doesn't hurt to be more cautious of your environment, I guess.
R:  It's true.  Um, it brings my -- back a memory of [LAUGH] -- we went on Amtrak once --
L:  Uh-huh [NOISE].  
R:  -- and, just as we sat down and I took --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- my shoes off --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and everything --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it was a long ride [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  Put my feet up, my husband informed me that he left his wallet --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- on the taxi.
L:  Oh, no!
R:  And we were pulling out.
L:  Oh, no! [NOISE]
R:  Now, I jumped up --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I ran through, like, four trains yelling "Stop the train!"
L:  Oh, really?
R:  [NOISE] And I'm thinking now, if I had to -- had done it now --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they would have probably --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- tackled me and [LAUGH] --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  So they did stop the train?
R:  No [LAUGH].
L:  [NOISE] Oh [LAUGH]
