L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  I'm Jacqueline.
R:  Well, I'm Jackie, and I'm from Michigan.  Hi.
L:  Well I'm from Michigan too.
R:  Really?
L:  Yes.
R:  Excellent. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, um, I live in Grand Rapids.  Where do you live?
R:  I'm down in Hillsdale, Michigan.
L:  Oh, Hillsdale, okay.
R:  Yeah.  Okay.
L:  Okay, we're not that far from each other.
R:  No. 
L:  No.
R:  And we're going to talk about the Middle East, eh? [LAUGH] 
L:  About today, about the Middle East, what I think about it, um, I know it's a lot of turmoil, you know, and I know, um, the people, they don't want, you know, us, you know, to hurry up and get out.  I understand some people have said they want us to hurry up and get out -- get out of, you know, Iraq --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- but you know, a lot of times when you have a situation like that -- that -- that's just not that easy.  You know, once you get in there and you try to liberate people you just can't leave them hanging.
R:  Well, we did that in World War one and we created a lot more enemies.
L:  That's right, you know, and not only that, they said it happened before, when, you know, when they was, ah, in Saudi Arabia.
R:  Exactly.
L:  When they cut that war off --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that a lot of those people, you know, they got slaughtered by what's his name, Hussein?
R:  Yeah.
L:  They got slaughtered by him, they got killed, they got put in prison, you know and stuff so --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- they were fighting [inaudible] when they first came over there, the people was a little leery, which I don't too much blame them, I'd be leery too if I got left hanging like that too.
R:  No kidding.
L:  And so I think they should stay over there and do what they -- what they said they was gonna do and -- and make sure and stay there until everything is done right.
R:  I guess I sort of feel that way.  Whenever you intervene in anybody's life --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you just don't go in and leave --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but if you decide to do that, you have some responsibility for the outcome.
L:  That's right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, I don't have a problem with that too.  I do have personal conflict as to how much we'll be able to do.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because so many issues came long before our time.
L:  Right.
R:  And I don't know if we have enough knowledge and wisdom to be a help, versus a hindrance. [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, so I get concerned on that level.  I don't know about you, but --
L:  Well you know, yeah, I do that -- but like I said, I think they can -- can help --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- you know, every time when somebody, you know, when you see people being oppressed and, you know --
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.
L:  -- I guess, see, we know -- we know nothing in the United States.  We don't really know nothing about that, at least I don't, you know, no nothing about --
R:  Yeah, I'd like to think -- go ahead.
L:  Okay.  I said, you know, we -- us in the United States, we really don't know about, you know, being slaughtered or being starved, or, you know, all this sort of stuff --
R:  No, no.
L:  -- we don't know -- we don't know nothing about none of that stuff so we can't even --
R:  But I --
L:  -- probably even understand really what's going on over there.
R:  My only concern is hopefully we will be more sensitive --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- than we've been sometimes in the past --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- to their cultures and their way of life --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because sometimes I think when we've come in as a country, going to help --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we somehow assume our way is the only way.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I have a sneaky hunch that we need to be listeners --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a little bit over there and -- and have an appreciation for some of their traditions.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, I believe -- I believe that, 'cause you cannot go in there and try to change people's culture you know, and try to get them to see things your way.  You know, now if they come over here, you know, leave from over there and come over here --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- that's when they going to have to try to, you know, they would have to, you know, submit to the way things are being done here.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.
L:  But, you know -- right, and see, some of them they --
R:  Exactly.  Because I'm -- I'm in ah, oh, used to be in social work --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- and we would get into situations with various ethnic groups --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that later we'd find out what we thought was the right way, went against everything -- I mean, the ethnic groups had their own way sometimes of dealing with issues --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it wasn't good or bad, it was just different.
L:  Right.
R:  And so I'm hoping this time we've got enough people over there who are experts in their culture --
L:  Right --
R:  -- so --
L:  -- me -- me too, you know, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah.  I'm like you, I don't want us going in there and just leaving 'em hanging.  I think --
L:  You know, and leaving them, hanging or abandon them, well we're going to do what we want to do, or this and that or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- even not even let them be pressured --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, because you know, you get -- you get pressured from the -- well the Russians said this, and we -- who cares what the Russians think?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I'm just saying, because you know, Russia, you know, a lot of times they're not, you know, they're for what they want, you know, they got their interest, you know.
R:  That became obvious when we found out they had the contract selling arms to 'em, didn't it?
L:  That's right.  That's what I'm saying, so what do we care about what they care or wh- -- wh- -- wh- -- or about what France is talking about?  You know.
R:  I -- I just worry that we don't have people here, you know, hovering over our [inaudible] oil spoils --
L:  Right.
R:  -- if -- if he does what we really says he's going to do --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that they'll get 'em operating and they'll use the funds to help the country rebuild --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- man, I'm all for it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But if we start fighting all of a sudden, our -- our companies from the US are running their oilfields, you know what I mean?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And all of a sudden the profits aren't going back into that country, then I probably would be upset, you know.
L:  Right.  Yeah, I would too, because you know, I understand sometimes people just -- some of them are not going to do things right and everybody wants -- huh?
R:  Yeah, I was just going to say, when money's involved --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know.
L:  That's like, when money's involved you know, things don't always wo- -- go the way it should go, you know --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- now some people, even though you might entrust them to do what's right, like you said, money's involved, sometimes they don't always do what's right.  They do what they want to do.  See what I'm saying?
R:  Yeah, so I'm -- yeah, so I -- I don't --
L:  And then -- and then they lie and, you know, and then they don't tell the truth about --
R:  Then we find out years later --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that they did all this stuff and we didn't know about it.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  So I'm hoping for once our actions are where our mouths are --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and that we are doing the right thing for the right reasons.
L:  Right.
R:  And I'm hoping the international communities will [inaudible] keep us, you know, watch us coast[?]
L:  Mhm.
R:  I wouldn't mind that at all.
L:  And then you know another thing too, they keep talking about this, you know, smoking gun and they hide weapons, you know.  I -- I believe he had weapons of mass destruction.  I believe he had them all the time, you know, just 'cause they haven't -- I don't know, 'cause see, I haven't -- I haven't heard the news, I don't hear it on a day to day basis --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- some days I'm not listening, so I don't know if they ever found any weapons of mass destruction [several inaudible words] and I'm thinking, you know what, you know, th- -- one thing about this man, I don't think he's as stupid as they thought he was, you know.  He's not going to sit there and he knew they were coming after him so he was going to get rid of them or whatever he did with them, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so they said some places, like, they feel were just freshly -- they knew some of the stuff was just taken out of there, you see what I'm saying.
R:  Yeah, I was just going to say, do you ever worry who has them now?
L:  Yeah, that's what -- and see that's what I -- yeah, I'm concerned about who got 'em, you know.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, because they went somewhere.
R:  They're somewhere.
L:  Somewhere, they went somewhere and you know, where, you know, and eventually we're hoping that they'll show up, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because we know they didn't destroy all that stuff --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- one time I was looking at a report, I saw on TV, they was talking about um, it was somewhere in Russia --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- because Russia one time, they was making weapons of mass destruction and some of the stuff, you know, really, you know, Russia [inaudible] they wanted the United States -- this was on TV now [several inaudible words] I might be saying the name wrong.
R:  Yeah.  Don't worry about that, I can't pronounce half of them either.
L:  Anyway, they were saying something about they wanted the United States to come over there and, you know, pay them to clean out their -- their weapons program --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but they was saying that this thing was so anybody could come in there and get weapons and go out there and they wouldn't even know because there are no guards there.  Nobody doing nothing.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  They wanted the United States to come in there and -- and pay them the money to get it cleaned up.  Why do we need to pay them money to get their own stuff cleaned up?
R:  There you go.
L:  That's just crazy.
R:  Yeah, I agree.
L:  That's crazy.  I'm like --
R:  Do you think -- do you think he's still alive?
L:  Oh, who?  Hussein?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh yeah.  I believe he's still alive.
R:  Yeah.  I wonder if he's still connected --
L:  I believe he's still alive because they said, what was it, the day before he -- before they -- before they started the war, they said him and his sons, now this is what I heard some people on the news talking about, whether it's true or not --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that him and his sons went and took the money out of the bank --
R:  Yes, they did have a bunch didn't they.
L:  -- the day before and [inaudible] in a truck.  Huh?
R:  Yes, they did have a bunch of money, didn't they?  Stashed away.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  Yeah [several inaudible words] bank, so you know, if you going to take money out of there you -- you going to leave the country.  So they're somewhere and some of these others, you know, Muslim countries, I believe they're harboring them.  I really do.
R:  Yes.  I do too.  I mean why not?  They've got a lot of bucks.  Once again, we're back to the money.
L:  That money.  You know, and if he say, "I give you this sum of money", they're, "Oh, you can stay here, you know, we'll tell them that you're not here and [inaudible]."  They got to be hiding 'cause I -- I just can't see that this man could just leave and nobody never find him, you see what I'm saying?
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  These countries, they sit there and they hide these people --
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  -- and then they -- and then they say they're not, you know, and it's like this is Saudi Arabia, even though you know, we was over there fighting, boy, then they were doing things you know, this is what they -- this is what the news says, [inaudible] I only quote what I read.
R:  Well, what you -- what can you go on?  I mean --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know.
L:  They said they were doing things back then when the war was going on, you know what I'm saying, you know --
R:  Yeah, I think folk -- well it sounds like -- like you agree with me that we're in there --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we better be committed to staying there until things settle down, and we're there to help not just to bust 'em up.
L:  That's right.  I -- I-- I'm a firm believer because I don't think nobody should go even if you're helping somebody, like, you say you've been in social work, you go in there and help them get on their feet.  You don't go in there and take over --
R:  Yeah.  You don't --
L:  There are some people will come in and try to take over --
R:  Yeah, you don't abandon them, you stay around --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to make sure they're going to be okay.  Exactly.  Exactly.
L:  And you know, and give them the proper things that they need to get 'em on -- on -- on their feet because sometimes some people, they might need encouraging.  Sometimes some people might need education --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you see what I'm saying?
R:  It's not just a matter of a check.  It's a matter of --
L:  Yeah, and give them a chance to start doing something.
R:  Right, right, until all the old grudges that have been put down, too, don't rear up and then they start a civil war, you know, like they do in -- in like in Russia where when they all got their freedom then they started shooting each other up, you know.
L:  Right.  That's right.
R:  And there's a lot of folks over there got a reason to be real mad. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, [several inaudible words] news cut trying to show 'em about them, you know, looting.  I said, what was the big deal them talking about, you know, and making a big deal when people looting, I said we got people looting over here in our country.
R:  Oh, I thought one of the funniest things I saw was this guy, he had one of the throne chairs, he'd gotten out of the one of the castles --
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- and he said -- and he was talking about all the stuff that had happened to him and the jailings and the beatings --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and he said, "I don't care, this -- this chair is so big it's going to take my whole living room --
L:  Mhm.
