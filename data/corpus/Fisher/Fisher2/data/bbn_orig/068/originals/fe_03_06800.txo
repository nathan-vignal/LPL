R:  [NOISE]  Uh, hi, this is Rachael. [NOISE]
L:  Hi, this is Chris.  Um, I am forty four years old and I have nine children and I live in Georgia.  [LIPSMACK] And who are you? [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Um.  I've never done this before. [NOISE]
L:  Me either.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Okay.  Um.  I'm nineteen and I live in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- California. [NOISE]
L:  Okay.
R:  And I've just finished my first year --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- at Berkley. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, wow.  Well, good for you. [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] Thanks. [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] Well, let's see. [NOISE]  Our topic was what?  Do the -- do the athletes --
R:  Athletes.
L:  -- deserve the high salaries? [NOISE]
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] Is that it? [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Okay.  Well, what do you think?
R:  [NOISE] Well, as far as sorry, the TV's on here as far as the high fives that they get, I don't think they do.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I think it's too --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- much.  I definitely think that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they do deserve a good salary but -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't know -- and I know it's hard work --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- you know, they train a lot and, um, it's demanding in a lot of ways.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Not -- not just physically, but I think it's kind of ridiculous that they get the --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [LAUGH] millions [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- that they do.
L:  For playing a game. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  I agree. [NOISE] I don't they deserve for -- for probably a lot of the same reasons, but um, [NOISE] the only reason that I think they would deserve it -- oh, there are a couple of reasons. [NOISE] One is that uh, the owners make so many millions.  I don't think it's fair that the owners make millions and millions and that the, [LIPSMACK] uh, the people who actually do the work don't receive [NOISE] -- you know, but they should receive high -- a -- a reasonable compensation, a certain percentage.  But I don't think that the owners should be making what they make.  I think it's ridiculous --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the price that people have to pay to go watch them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] That's the thing.
R:  I think the price should be lowered for --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- the games [LIPSMACK] and then -- but they're still going to make tons of money because --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- the fan base is huge.  So I think that --
L:  [NOISE] They would.  They would make tons -- still tons of money.
R:  Ya.  I think that they should -- I don't know how you could require them to route their money 
L:  Well, the only way that you could require them is for people not to go.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] If people don't go then they lower their prices.  I know, we live in Atlanta and the um -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the owner of the football team, 'cause they did really crappy, they -- he --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- lowered their prices and they did all these things to attract fans.  They gave 'em food and [NOISE] you know.  But that's -- that's the way it should be.  I mean--
R:  Mm.
L:  -- don't go!  If people wouldn't go and pay the prices then they would.  They would drop the prices.
R:  Well.  What if every team, like, played for maybe a charitable cause, you know?  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So maybe you would set the base salary for a certain type --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of people that have been in a sport for however long, you know.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  So maybe it's graduated income kind of like teachers, but --
L:  [NOISE] That's a thought.
R:  -- it's determined upon that and then the excess money goes towards the charity that they play for.
L:  [NOISE]  Mm.
R:  And then fans could still go and still get a large fan base and you'd still generate all of the money but it wouldn't just be millions sitting in people's pockets. [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, but if you -- if the millions are there -- if you charge that much anyway to get in, then the owners will [NOISE] -- I mean you -- I just don't believe [NOISE] that they would ever do it.  I think you'd just have to get rid of the [NOISE] -- the excess money, such horrendous amounts, and ah -- so that they didn't have [NOISE] access to it.  I don't think [NOISE] that people, the owners, uh, would be [LIPSMACK] honest and be able to give all that up.  I don't think they could.
R:  Yeah.  No, I don't think they would be either. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  [NOISE]  
L:  [NOISE] I think they'd find some way to +finagle it. [LAUGH] So   
R:  [MN]
L:  [NOISE] It's just ridiculous that people are willing to pay such exorbitant amounts to go see somebody play a game.  That's just ridiculous.
R:  I know.
L:  [NOISE] And I'm actually a real sports fan. [NOISE] So 
R:  Yeah.  I went and saw the As game for two bucks the other day --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- just because, you know, I'm in the area.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  And that worked out really well, you know, just fun and --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- cheap and you go with friends, but 
L:  [NOISE] But it's just fun. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It's -- it's -- exactly.
L:  [NOISE] We're not saving lives, or [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.  And you don't have to work for a whole day at it to earn enough money to go to some event.
L:  [NOISE] Right.  Yeah.  It's just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] -- not -- it's not right to put so much value -- and then I think if they didn't --weren't paid such horrendous amounts of money, maybe they wouldn't be looked as such [NOISE] role models, you know, and successful.  Just being able to make a lot of money does not make you a successful person [NOISE] but people think that anyway.  They think "Oh, he makes five million dollars.  He must be [NOISE] just a terrific guy" which isn't necessarily the case.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Not at all.
L:  [MN] [NOISE]
R:  Not at all.  My Youth Leader's brother plays pro ball or, um, almost pro ball for the Oriels[?] I think
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  And any- -- and so he, like, I get -- you know, I hear about him.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  But then she tells me some of the stories about some of the guys that he plays with [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- and, you know?  It's just like, man! [MN]
L:  [NOISE] Scummy huh?  [LAUGH]
R:  Money doesn't really make it -- not at all.
L:  [NOISE] No.  And -- and money gives them a false sense of wellbeing and success too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] Don't cripple yourselves.  If they were wise -- I think that one of the reasons they started paying them so much money is because they can get hurt and --
R:  Sure.
L:  [NOISE] -- they really have very short years to play, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- 'cause they just get old and so they pay them a lot of money so that they c- -- they can be cared for later, but they don't -- they don't take care of their money, you know.  They don't, uh, save it or whatever. [SIGH] So  [NOISE]
R:  I think that's the biggest problem.  That because even if maybe over time their salary is comparable 'cause maybe they only get really paid that much for ten years --
L:  Right, [NOISE] right.
R:  -- or something, um, then that's basically retirement money.  So --
L:  Yeah.  Maybe that's a good idea. [NOISE] 
R:  -- it's probably more comparable to what we're getting -- comparably.  I dunno, mor- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- maybe more comparable than what we think, but ye- yeah, they don't manage it, well for the most part.
L:  Right.  Yeah.  And not many people would.  You can't even blame 'em.
R:  No. [LAUGH] I mean if I have that much money [LAUGH] -- 
L:  You know, I mean if you have a lot of money [LAUGH] you -- and they're usually quite young --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so they -- they don't [NOISE] -- well, you're nineteen but I know what it feels like to be nineteen.  You think, "Oh, I'll never be forty" or, "I'll never even be thirty".  That seems just a million miles away, you know.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  So it's hard to -- I can't blame 'em for that. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I know. [MN]
L:  When you're eighteen or nineteen making millions you think, "Oh, I'll always have money.  This is like forever". [SIGH] [NOISE] Um --
R:  Ya.  And if you were going invest it, you know, even if you leave a small percentage --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you think, "Oh my gosh, I could've spent that, you know?  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And I've just lost --
L:  Right.
R:  -- thousands of dollars --
L:  Right.
R:  -- on a slight detail[?].  Yeah.  So 
L:  Well, sounds like we agree a lot. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I was just -- um, once you go around it seems like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's there for a reason. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It just --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  -- it's unfortunate that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- more idealistic terms can't be set upon it.
L:  Right.
R:  I guess we're human after all. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  We can't be more reasonable and [SIGH] sensible but -- prob- -- it all comes back to really the who's [NOISE] paying the [NOISE] bucks and um, [LIPSMACK] what w- -- people are willing to pay for.  If people would not tolerate paying the high prices it wouldn't be this way. [NOISE]  But people continue to be willing --
R:  It is what the market will bear.
L:  Exactly.
R:  It [MN] [SIGH] --
L:  That's exactly right.  'Cause people will pay it, that's what they charge.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  So it's really up to us --
R:  I know.  And 
L:  -- to say, "Excessive.  Not going".  [LAUGH] [SIGH]
R:  And then there are too many hard --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- core sports fans, where they're not -- like, "I can't just not go to the games".
L:  They're insane.
R:  You're like, "Well, you know, if you did it for a season". [LAUGH]
L:  That's right.  Hang on just a second.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [several inaudible words]  Okay, fine. [several inaudible words] again.  I'll -- I'll call you later.  Be some time tomorrow [several inaudible words] if you don't, I will. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [several inaudible words] Oh, please.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [several inaudible words] [NOISE] Okay. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [several inaudible words] Oh, thanks [NOISE] [several inaudible words].
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Okay, okay [several inaudible words].  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Okay.  Sorry.  I have my piano les- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- my piano teacher here for my kids and she's [NOISE] just getting ready to leave. 
R:  [MN]
L:  I had to [LAUGH] say something to her --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- instead of just ignore her --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- so, um -- all right, professional athletes.  Well, who did you go to see?  You saw the As?
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, the Oakland As.
L:  Oakland As.
R:  [NOISE] And they were playing the Kings and they were supposed to win but they didn't. [NOISE] [MN]
L:  Uh-oh.
R:  Oh, well. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I guess they always do better in the last part of their season.
L:  I guess so. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, that's what they[?] were saying. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But um, I think 
L:  [NOISE] Well, who -- who -- who're some of their big players that play there.
R:  Oh, God, I'm so bad.  I ju- --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I don't follow them at all.  I just went with some friends. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But I had a good time.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, good. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Well, what do you think it was worth to go see?  How much would you pay to go to that experience again?  What do you think it'd be worth?  I mean if -- if you thought, "Oh, that would be fun to do tonight" how much do you think you would pay?
R:  Well see, [NOISE] the game itself I'd probably pay -- mm-kay I was gonna say --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- see it depen- --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- if I was going with a good group of friends, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that'd be worth it.  I think I'd pay like up to five or ten dollars for --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- especially little seats that we were in which were like way back. 
L:  Okay, for the nose bleeds. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  I -- I mean that must have -- all in all, the trip cost about that much anyways 'cause, you know, had to buy the bar tickets --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then you buy a couple of hot dogs and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there you go.  And so it all adds up.
L:  So, how much did it cost? [NOISE] How much was it to get in and -- like that?
R:  Let's see here.  Well, um, Bart[?] was about four bucks and then --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they were having dollar hot dogs except that I [several inaudible words] --
L:  [NOISE] Oh, that's not bad.
R:  -- so it was like eight bucks for the whole thing.  You know [MN] --
L:  Oh, that's not bad.
R:  No.  Not at all. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh boy.
R:  And that was fun and I think that maybe if you lowered the price a bit you'd get more of a fan base, you know.
L:  Were there a lot of people there or was it half and half empty or what? [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, it was.  It was 'cause I mean it's a promotional, Wednesdays, you know.  Two dollar Wednesdays.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, I see.  So, it's not normally that inexpensive?
R:  Right.  Exactly.  It's usually more expensive.
L:  Ooh.
R:  [NOISE] And I can also notice there's some things you want to
