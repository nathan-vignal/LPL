R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  I'm Gina.
R:  I'm Jamie.
L:  How are you?
R:  I'm fine.  How are you?
L:  I'm fine.  Have you done these, um, discussions before?
R:  Yes.  And you?
L:  Th- -- this is my second one.
R:  Okay.  Okay.
L:  So --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  we're supposed to talk about airport security and if it lessens the chance of terrorism?
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Fun topic.
R:  Yeah.  Well, no.  That -- that's not a problem.  I ju- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I just personally do not think that it -- it actually will do it.
L:  I don't either.  I think if they -- you know, if they have their minds -- and somebody has their mind set up that that they wanna do something, then --
R:  They're gonna do it.
L:  -- they're gonna find a --  Yeah, they're gonna find a way around whatever security systems we have in place. 
R:  Yeah.  Well, the one thing that has been most interesting.  I'm from the Philadelphia area.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And one thing I found most interesting is that the people they put in place, um, actually we have like our own security systems and they found, er, personnel and they found out the -- [MN] they'd be, um, not that well trained. 
L:  Right.
R:  So they changed them over to people -- and yet when you really look into it you find out that [LAUGH] in fact it's actually some of the same [LAUGH] people --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that they fired --
L:  We- --
R:  -- they just brought them back under another guise.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because, it's all union and, you know, one hand washes the other in politics.
L:  Right, right.
R:  So, I -- I don't think -- I think if they took them and they really trained them then you might have a fifty fifty shot.
L:  Right.
R:  But these people are there to get their money, to -- to put the time in to get their --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- money, and that's it.  And I mean, a lot of things go past there and a lot of things, you know.  It's not a perfect system.  The security systems are constantly breaking down.
L:  Mm.
R:  They're in need of repair.  You know what I mean?  So, I think that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- whatever the case is, they're gonna get through.
L:  Right.  I know, um, in the St Louis region, they had, um -- you know, did the -- the big overhaul and, you know, firing all the old, um, screeners and bringing in a new company and -- I heard several female members that tried to, you know, um -- with law enforcement background, that tried to get on there --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and it was actually a pretty rigorous, you know, screening process.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, you know, none of them made it and they all had, you know, impeccable records, military service, and, you know, the only person I know that got on had a, um, political conne- -- colle- -- er, connection.
R:  That's was I was gonna say.  It -- there is a lot of politics that are going on --
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  -- with this.  It's politically --
L:  Yeah, he had a -- a --
R:  appointed.
L:  -- friend of a friend --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- type of thing.
R:  You -- you go to your State representative and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you're in.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And you're in.  And it's still -- it's still politically controlled.  There's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there's no way around it.  They -- these were political appointments originally.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they're -- they're still political appointments.
L:  Right.  And, you know, as far as like whether it's gonna make everything safer, I don't know.  You know, like I said, you know, like, yeah, they -- things break down, things get past people, um --
R:  It's just, they've had a bad day --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know.
L:  Yeah, they're talking to their friend and something gets right past them.
R:  I mean, if they can -- if luggage -- as you see on TV -- if luggage can be snatched right in front of them.
L:  Right.
R:  While they're talking and eating their Twinkie.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  I mean, [LAUGH] how much -- I'm serious [LAUGH].  How much more is getting past, you know what I mean?
L:  Right.
R:  Because I had that problem when I had to go out there and -- Philadelphia, in our airport, we actually have like a, er, a mallette, you know what I mean?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And this is before all the major security systems went into play.  And, ah, I was trying to purchase something and they said, "We don't have it".  I was in Centre City and they said, "We don't have it in here, but if you go out to the airport to section B. we have a -- we -- we have a sister store there.  It will be there waiting for you".  So I went out there and, [LIPSMACK] you still had to go through the -- the general screening.  This is before --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the high security systems got put in.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, I mean, it was funny because I had, um, feminine products in my bag [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And the guy was giving me a double look [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Like, yo.  And -- and then there was, er -- um, a -- a chi- -- a teenager that must have been pierced in the nipple area.
L:  Oh!
R:  'Cause he could -- send, he kept, er, switching the -- the alarms off.
L:  Oh.
R:  When he kept trying to go back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, right --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I'm sitting there laughing 'cause I don't know what's going on at this point.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, all of a sudden I think the security guard got a clue and he -- and the kid had a Pepsi in his hand, or something and he said, "Start drinking and tip your head up, right".  So, he's got this bottle of soda up in the air, drinking it down --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- and the guy's scanning his chest and [LAUGH] it's going off, and he's like, "Oh, nipple rings, okay, let him go" [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I thought it was hysterical, you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah, that was, you know, the other thing, yeah, I think they, sometimes they, especially after the -- the attacks.
R:  Right.
L:  People, they took things a little too far.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I don't know if you heard of the -- the woman who had to drink breast milk.
R:  No!
L:  Yes.  They, um, [MN] I forget where I saw the report, but, I remember my brother called me from the airport, 'cause he had come home for Christmas.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, he had gotten a shake or something and they made him drink it.
R:  What?  The breast milk?
L:  No.
R:  Oh, the shake --
L:  -- they made him drink the shake.
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
L:  And I thought, "Well, that's really odd.  They're making you drink whatever you've got in your hand before you cross through".
R:  You know --
L:  And then --
R:  -- the funny thing is, in the Philadelphia --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- airport is they can take, like, your, em, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] oh, what is it?  Um -- um, I'm clueless tonight.  Your shavers.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Your Bic razors.  They can take them off of you.
L:  Oh.
R:  But, as soon as you go past through security, there's a, um, you know, like a paper goods store there --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- a newsstand that you can buy the Bic shavers back.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We thought that was funny, you -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- know what I mean.  They're taking the Bic shavers off you but you just walk twenty feet you can buy them back [LAUGH].
L:  They're taking them from you, so you have to go buy them back [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] It was hysterical.  We were like ...
L:  They're reselling the ones they pick up from the passengers.
R:  Well, it was funny.  We were -- we were laughing.
L:  Mm.
R:  We're like, "How can we buy this on this side of the fence, but we can't take ours through [LAUGH]?"  
L:  Right.
R:  You know.
L:  That doesn't make any sense.
R:  That was one of the funny ones.
L:  [MN]
R:  We were laughing on that one.  It's like, yeah, they, I -- [MN] you know what though?  And a lot of the pilots have had to take marshal arts training --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it's the stewardesses and they've been licensed to carry guns now.  Some of them.
L:  Right.
R:  Can carry guns on the planes.  Now see, that bothers me because that really is not in their job description.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  And I -- I would feel threatened if I had to do that.
L:  Right.
R:  You know what I mean?  If that was initially in my job description then that's something --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'd go to because I've agreed to.
L:  Right.
R:  But -- but the changing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it in mid stream --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- instead of hiring more --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of the air captains, you know what I mean --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the air marshals.  They're trying to make the stewardesses and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the pilots do the job.
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  And that --
L:  [NOISE] And that's -- you know, it's not what they should be doing.
R:  No.  They should be doing their job and letting the police do -- have them to do their job, you know.
L:  Well, and then, you know what scares me is, you know, [NOISE] the pilot that decides to stop in at the, er, you know, the little bar for a couple of [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- a couple of little, you know, drinks before --
R:  Drinkeepoos before --
L:  -- he gets on the plane.
R:  -- he gets on.  
L:  Right.
R:  I think sometimes it's a little exaggerated.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Most of the time these guys are pretty crackerjack because they know [SIGH] it's an awesome responsibility.
L:  Right.
R:  You know.  I think that -- that's been played out a little more than -- I mean, I think that's more in the comic relief --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- movies.  Than they are in actual real life.  Because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like I said, I'm -- I'm a Philadelphian and I was close to the New York area and I have friends in the New York area when the whole nine eleven thing came down.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, in fact, I have a friend who works with emergency equipment and they actually called him to come up.
L:  [NOISE] Mm.
R:  Um, to ask him to teach them how to use his emergency equipment.
L:  Oh,
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  Mhm.
R:  To -- to drill the holes and get the pipes down to get the air into some areas and w- -- get the water out of other areas and he was just devastated.  He came back and he was a basket case, and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- this was one of the most brilliant men I've ever had the pleasure of meeting.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And I got a call, like, two in the morning.  He went down to Atlantic City and he was standing on the beach and he was like saying, "I can finally breathe".  And apparently what -- what had really triggered him off was the ash that was coming off the buildings -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- was not concrete, it was actually human ash.
L:  Oh!
R:  And when he realized what he was being flaked with.  It kind of s- -- kind of spaced him out.
L:  Oh, right!  Is that --
R:  Totally spaced him out. 
L:  -- I can imagine.
R:  Yeah.  And he just -- he was calling home and he was like, you know, talking to me and he was erratic, and I was like, you know, "Calm down, [LAUGH] come to my house" do what you, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  And then he wound up somewhere between New York which, like I said, we're in the Philadelphia area --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and he works just over the bridge in New Jersey.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  He wound up in Atlantic City screaming -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- he can breathe at two o clock in the morning.  And I'm like, "That's nice.  Now go back into the casinos, get a hotel room [LAUGH], you know. 
L:  Right.
R:  It's not safe out there [LAUGH] --
L:  Tell me about it --
R:  -- that hour of the night --
L:  Yeah.
R:  you know what I mean?
L:  Uh.  It's amazing.  You know what -- what they had to go through.
R:  Oh yeah!
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And a lot of people lost --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- their jobs.
L:  Mhm [NOISE]
R:  A lot of people.  And -- and some people -- you know, but what --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- really burned my buns was that there was actually people claiming they had dead relatives --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just to collect the money.
L:  Right.
