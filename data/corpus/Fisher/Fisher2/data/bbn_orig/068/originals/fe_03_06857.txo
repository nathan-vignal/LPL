R:  Hello!
L:  Hi!
R:  Hi!
L:  My name is Peggy.
R:  Your name is Peggy?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Okay.  My name's Bianca[?].  And so, where are you calling from?  Where are you at?
L:  Tennessee.
R:  In Tennessee?  Okay.  I'm in Michigan.  [MN] Okay, um, I haven't had the chance to do a lot of traveling since nine one one; with the airport security.  But I have heard that a lot of people says, you know, "You gotta there a hour before, or two hours, some places, three hours before your flight.
L:  Yes.
R:  And, [SIGH] you know, I'm -- I'm believing that it's more, um, more protection, 'cause of the things that have -- I've been out there.  I took my sister to the airport.  You know, to fly and stuff like that, and I see they had all these things and I think that, you know, I think that's a good thing and I think they should have probably done some of this, er, stuff before now instead of waiting until the last minute [LAUGH] you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- before all this here stuff happened, because I know sometime I went out there and just -- anybody can walk in and do stuff, you know, and stuff like that.  In -- I mean, at our airport.  I don't know about the one you have in Tennessee.  But the one that I have, um, it's like that [PAUSE].  Hello?
L:  [NOISE] Th- --
R:  Yeah?
L:  The bigger airports probably have more [NOISE], er, security than -- we have a small airport close to us. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] And, I think they've tightened security, but probably nothing like the bigger ones do.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, er, I do know that they have discontinued a lot of services --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because of nine one one.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Em.  I work for a veterinarian and this time of year, then we're shipping semen to breed mares in different part of the country.
R:  Mm.
L:  And some of the owners can't shift semen any more.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because they don't meet whatever criteria the airports have now.
R:  Mhm.  Well, you see, I -- mine -- I guess they done met all -- all that, 'cause you know, like I said, when I took my sister out there, they, um -- you know, you had to step right in there 'cause usually you could -- you could go in the airport, and you could sit in there.  You could sit like, you know, right where -- where they got ready to get on the plane.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And now they got to the --
L:  Watch them take off.
R:  -- point, you just -- you can't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- as soon as they, you know, coming in that's as far as you can go.  There's this one snack area in ours, and then when they get ready to go down there you cannot go no farther past that line.
L:  Mm.
R:  And then one time we used to -- could go out to the airport and stand up on this, er, one thing and watch the plane come in and watch them come down --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- and wave at people, you know, they've cut all that out.  We cannot -- not even do any -- any of that stuff any more.  And I used to like that, but, you know, but if it's gonna protect people and keep us, you know, er, safe then if that's what they have to do, that's what they have to do.  And like I said, my sister, she -- she travels all the time and she says, you know, "Sometimes, it can be a little frustrating" you know.  You get off this plane and you gotta go through this and they gotta, you know, search you 'cause [several inaudible words] and, um, she said how they go in there to search you [LAUGH] sometime.  And sometime you get put into these rooms and stuff like that --"
L:  Mm. [NOISE]
R:  -- and, you know.
L:  All your luggage gone through. [MN] 
R:  Yes.  And open and, you know, and they weren't doing that before.  But somebody got a knife or gun, you know.  I still think that's good if that's what hap- -- happened but I still think they should be a little careful, especially when they searching women, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They make sure, you know, they ain't gonna be petting people and pulling and doing all that, you know, [LAUGH] stuff  --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and   'Cause, I mean, there was a lady, you know, she said they -- they really patted her down and she was really embarrassed when they got done.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Because she had, um, what was it?  Something in her, it was a bra or something.  It kept going off [LAUGH].  So they -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- told the couple they had to strip her, you know 'cause they kept going off and stuff like that.  And actually it was really embarrassing.  And, so --
L:  Yeah.  The under wire in bras sometimes trip it.
R:  Ah?
L:  The under wire.
R:  Yeah.  The under wire.  That's was it was, you know.  She said they -- they couldn't, you know, get that right so they finally let her go through.  But she said that was too embarrassing for them to do that, you know.  They pull you in a room and, you know, and look at them, but they gotta strip search you and looking for what it is, and all that sort of stuff, you know.  And, you know.  But she --
L:  But at the same time, yes it is very embarrassing.  I would be very embarrassed. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, if they don't then people could be hiding things. 
R:  That's right.  That's right.
L:  And so, I think I would be -- rather be a little embarrassed --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or maybe a lot embarrassed.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  As dead.
R:  Right. 
L:  So ...
R:  And I think, like you said, the bigger airports is probably even worse, 'cause, you know, even where it hit at, you know.  Those people, they still got them in -- in your mind.  'Cause when you go out the airport, that wouldn't make -- well, it makes you think about, at least me.  The times I went out there, make you think about nine one one, you know, and all this here stuff.  
L:  Yeah. 
R:  But, you know, and -- and hoping that -- that they're really safe, you know.  You still wond- -- wondered if you still safe even after all that.  You know, 'cause sometimes they can have a plan in there, like employees.  You know, they could have something, or pass somebody something.  We just don't know, you know. 
L:  Yes [NOISE].
R:  And so they gotta, you know, stay on the top of all that, you know, and be on the lookout there, just not for people coming from the outside, 'cause sometimes when stuff like that happens it's an inside job anyway.  [PAUSE] [NOISE] That's what --
L:  Well, a lot of times --
R:  -- Uh?
L:  -- the employees get access --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to luggage, or whatever.
R:  Right.
L:  And [NOISE].  You just -- you just can't trust anybody [NOISE] any more [LAUGH].
R:  You really can't.  You really can't.  You know, and then, like a lot of times [COUGH], you know, even though, like, the Government, I'm hoping they're the one paying for this equipment because a lot of airplanes --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, someone [several inaudible words] 'cause people just not flying, like they n- [MN]-- you know, like they normally do even though they [several inaudible words] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and all that.  But they still, you know, are afraid to fly.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know.  And, um, you know, 'cause I got one -- one of my nieces.  She won't get on the plane, no, after that happened, even though she wasn't involved in it.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But I guess just seeing that on television really, you know, messed a lot of people's mind up 'cause they sit there all day and, you know, looking at that and looking at that and so they program their mind.  Well, I'm not --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- getting on no plane, no more.  You know, 'cause you never know whose on there.  And they -- and -- and -- and then another two that I was talking about the cockpit.  How they -- I don't know now how they used to just keep it open and anybody could just walk up in there and talk to the pilot and all this sort of stuff.
L:  I think it used to be.
R:  Yeah.  Like that.  And that was, you know, to me when I heard that, I thought that was kind of off too, you know 'cause you can't just trust people and let [several inaudible words] 'cause they had some time past --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they had planes been hijacked, you know, before this even happened.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know.  So I heard now that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they're thinking about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- having, or they might already gonna put this into, um, practice.  They're gonna start having pilots with guns on there, you know, and taking training or something.  Did you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- hear anything about that?
L:  [NOISE] Sky marshals.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  They were gonna -- were they gonna --
R:  Wh- --
L:  -- have sky marshals on every flight?
R:  Yeah, that -- but, now they said they was also they were gonna train the pilots.
L:  Oh!
R:  Yeah.  This was -- this was what I was reading and I seen it on the news.  This time, they're gonna start having them take training and have a gun on there, you know --
L:  Well 
R:  -- to protect themselves.  Yeah.
L:  That might not be a bad idea. 
R:  No, that's what I said.  It -- it -- I don't think it's a bad idea.  As long as they're not drunk, you know, and nothing like that.
L:  Right.
R:  Because I know here [MN] , where I live here in Michigan, one time they -- they grounded a plane 'cause the, um, pilot he was drunk.  His alcohol level was, you know, way, way, way, up there.  You see what I'm saying?  So 
L:  Well, they shouldn't be flying [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  He [several inaudible words] be flying, anyway.  So, that's one thing, in a person like that, don't need no gun either [LAUGH].
L:  Well, yeah, that's true.
R:  You know, just saying --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so.  Oh yeah.  So they said it happens, more them people.  I don't know.  Somebody turned him in.  'Cause he got ready to -- to get on there; they told him to get off.  'Cause they had, um, a person on there that was on the flight, that, you know, was a pilot but he wasn't on duty but then he was the one who flew the plane to the next destination.
L:  Ah.
R:  But they did get him off there.  Which is good, 'cause he don't need to be flying no plane --
L:  No.
R:  -- drunken.
L:  And, I didn't think they could even report to work if they were drunk.
R:  You would -- wouldn't have thought.
L:  Or had been drinking.
R:  Yeah, but this one did!
L:  I guess, if --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- they don't pay attention, then, yeah, they can -- they can get on there and fly!
R:  Right.
L:  Huh.
R:  So, you know, this is what I'm saying.  So, you know, that -- you know, security, I'm just hoping that, you know, that whatever they need to do and whatever it takes, you know, to protect the people because, you know, it needs to be done.  You know, because I'm -- like I said, I'm planning on doing some flying and I don't wanna be afraid when I'm flying and thinking that it could be somebody on that flight.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That, you know, got a gun, or knife, or stuck something in and they didn't detect it, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or something, you know.  Some new kinda, um, you know, weapon that people don't know about.  That -- that they ain't even thinking about, you see what I'm saying?  So --
L:  I'm nervous enough when I'm flying.  I don't fly very often [LAUGH]. 
R:  You don't?
L:  So I don't need anything else to be nervous about [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  That's what I'm saying, you know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I guess, you know that those kind of thoughts run through your mind when you're on a plane, now in this day.  And some people didn't ever had that worry before, but now they have that worry because, you know, because of things that have happened -- what things --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what people have done, you know.  And then nine one eleven.  Well, it, you know, to me, really was a wake up call.  For them, 'cause like I said the security wasn't up to what it should have been anyway. 
L:  Right.
R:  In the first place, it really wasn't.
L:  No, it wasn't.
R:  You know, 'cause everybody just said that basically they've come on there just, you know, do anything, they can go on a cockpit, talk to the people, walk back and forth, you know, and nobody, you know, did anything or thought anything about it, you know.  So, they brung weapons on there and   And one person said that, you know, it was somewhere that, you know, it was somewhere that they still was getting weapons through.  You know.
L:  [SIGH] I think I heard something about that too.  That --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, they were -- I don't remember if it was any particular --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- airport, or what, but -- but yeah, that some --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- people were still sneaking stuff through.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So that means they need to be even more --
R:  Right.
L:  -- security conscious.
R:  Mhm.  They will have to be 'cause you wondering how could they get this stuff through there and they got all this stuff before to detect it and they're still getting stuff through there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That make you wonder, you know, what is really going on, you know, why they can't, you know, get that part together, and why are they being -- they're not detecting it.  You know, -- 
L:  [NOISE] [MN]
R:  -- you see what I'm saying?  So, I just like, you know, I -- I think about, you know, flying and, you know, protection, but my sister, she says, "Go ahead", you know.  She's like an evangelist and so she'll be flying, you know, wherever she's needed, so she does a lot of flying so, you know, she tells me all the things that happen, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- even when she's flying here.  She said, "I just had to fly on the Grace of God" [LAUGH].  And, that's what she said, 'cause she [several inaudible words] thoughts do now come in her mind.
L:  Ahah.
R:  About that situation, you know.  But she's flying like at least once or twice a month.  Even more than that.
L:  Mm.
R:  And, so, when you go on that kind of ...
