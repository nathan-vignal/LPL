L:  Hello. [NOISE] 
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yes, hi.
L:  Hi.  How are you?
R:  Okay.
L:  Where are you calling from?
R:  I'm in New York City.
L:  Oh, really?  I'm in Boston.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, we're on the East Coast.
R:  Yup. [NOISE]
L:  And I know nothing about professional athletes --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- because I don't watch [LAUGH] professional athletics and -- not that I --
R:  Do you follow any sports at all?
L:  Um [SIGH] gosh.  Not since, I don't remember.  I mean, I -- I -- figure skating --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- 'cause I think that's fun to watch but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- if you ask me who the current people are -- I know Michelle Kwan -- [LAUGH] 
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- and that's about it.  And she -- actually her family live in the same neighbourhood we do so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- yeah, so it's kinda weird but, um, [LIPSMACK] that's about all I know. [LAUGH]  How -bout you?
R:  Well, [NOISE] I've never been too --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- interested in professional basketball [NOISE] because for a long time I lived in Pittsburgh and they didn't have a team --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- or they had these dreadful teams that [MN] existed for two years and they couldn't afford pro material, so they would hire these guys that played prison ball. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh no.
R:  But anyway, you know, it was like, "Forget it".  There was really no team and so I just never paid any attention to pro basketball.  But I like baseball.  Ah, I follow the Yankees.
L:  Oh you do?
R:  Yeah.
L:  See uh -- okay -- now there's -- there's a team that I could root for 'cause my --
R:  [LAUGH] And you're in Boston?
L:  Oh yeah, I --
R:  That's our great rival! [LAUGH] 
L:  -- it -- no -- no -- I -- I can't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- stand the Red Sox.  I can- --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- no 'cause, uh, [SIGH] I -- because my dad was -- well, my whole family's from New York City so --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- like I'm just -- I'm uh [LIPSMACK] -- I'm a displaced [SIGH] --
R:  Ah. 
L:  -- New Yorker so --
R:  I see, I see.
L:  -- and my heart [MN] is with -- is with the Yankees for sure.
R:  Ah, okay.
L:  Yeah, like I -- I don't -- I never go to Red Sox games 'cause they're yuck.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
L:  But [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm saying this over a recording too so -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- that they can trace my call. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh my God. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  What have I done to myself?
R:  They'll take -- they'll take away your -- your ah --
L:  My r- --
R:  -- your lease of your apartment.  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's right.  All my property will be [MN] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in -- in question.  Um, well that's -- so is there -- I don't -- [MN] I don't know the members -- the members of the team -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- or anything like that though. 
R:  Right.  Well, [SIGH] [NOISE] [MN] [LIPSMACK] well --
L:  Are there uh -- are they a- 
R:  -- you know [MN] it -- the -- the constant is George Steinbrenner who is the big bad wolf, right.
L:  Right, okay.  Yeah, I know him.
R:  And -- and -- and the man everyone loves to hate, and then he -- he periodically trashes whoever's the manager and tries to drive them out.
L:  But he's the owner, right?
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  And he's been the owner for a long time.
R:  Yes.  In fact, he was an owner even longer [NOISE] but for a relatively brief period he was forbidden to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- own a team because of, um, tax evasion. --
L:  Okay, right, right.
R:  -- and he was [MN] indited for felony.
L:  This coming f- -- this coming back now.  Okay.  I think I vaguely remember this in the sports page.
R:  Right.  So, he's a delightful man, as you might imagine --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and -- and he's dreadfully interfering. 
L:  Oh.
R:  At least by my -- my opinion, ah --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know.  I mean, he hired a -- he has a manager, right?  That's Joe Torre and --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- they have all these other officials there and Steinbrenner's money is from shipping, believe it or not. 
L:  Oh, really.
R:  He's from the great port of Cincinnati [LAUGH] --
L:  No kidding?
R:  -- but somehow [SIGH] ah, he has a lot of money from ship building and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- um -- [LIPSMACK] so this is like his hobby, except he's in there a lot --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and he spends a lot of time interfering.  [MN] Earlier this year, at the very beginning of the season, when they were doing [NOISE] exhibition games --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- he trashed two of the -- the best loved of the players --
L:  Oh no.
R:  -- one was Derek Jeter who is a very cute young sh- -- short stop.
L:  I'm sorry, what was his name?
R:  Derek Jeter.
L:  Okay.  I know that name.  Okay.
R:  Right.  And ah, another one was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- one of the pitchers and ah, you know, people were like outraged.
L:  Wow.
R:  And he criticized 'em um for momentarily low numbers even though they had won every game for like the first [NOISE] fifteen games.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.  I mean -- he was -- it was absurd --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and now he's bouncing on the -- the manager, Joe Torre, even though he's won how many World Series and [NOISE] American League Championships.
L:  Oh, that's awful.
R:  And he [MN] -- look, it's just -- it's his style.  He -- he does it I think to test people.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  To see if they'll be ticked off enough to leave --
L:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and then he assumes the next person will be cheaper.
L:  Oh g- -- no. [SIGH]
R:  And so, [NOISE] I -- I -- you know -- I don't know.  The thing is Steinbrenner, for instance, spends a lot of money on the team and, in fact, most of the other [NOISE] teams in his league --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and the national league hate him because he has so much money --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and they can't compete with salaries.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, he can buy --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- whoever he wants --
L:  I see. [SIGH] 
R:  -- and that's why the -- the Yankees have such a winning team.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  So, smaller market teams, like Pittsburgh, which is --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- hasn't had -- played well since the early nineteen eighties --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- frankly, and I know that because I used to live [NOISE] there then --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, [NOISE] you know, they're being destroyed by --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- this and this is one of the reasons they've all these disputes about profit sharing and all this stuff.
L:  I see. [SIGH] 
R:  Now, whether the players get paid too much -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] I don't know.  I mean, compared to a company executive --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- some of them which run them into the ground -- I don't think so.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, it's a lot of money.
L:  Right.
R:  But [MN] when they -- they say they're making you know -- they have a nine million dollar contract, that's over several years usually.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  Except for that one guy in uh -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the [NOISE] Texas Rangers.  So, most of them you know -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- most of 'em it's spread out. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  They have families --
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  Um [LIPSMACK] they pay taxes --
L:  Right.  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they have to have two places to live because there's the off season --
L:  Right.  Whoops. [NOISE] 
R:  -- and then they have to live somewhere near --
L:  Sorry, the phone just dropped --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- but I'm back on here.
R:  -- where the -- where their team is actually --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- located and they -- they have to travel around.  I mean --
L:  It's not a great life, I mean it's --
R:  No, it's not, and you -- you -- it's only -- you know.  They think a thirty five year old player is an old man.
L:  Yeah.  That's kinda -- I mean that's it.  Once you've done, you'd better have a college education or something going on --
R:  Or something -- why, and that's what happens.  A lot of them don't.  Um --
L:  Yeah.  They're recruited so early.
R:  I mean [MN] the -- I mean, we have now old[?] players at thirty nine or forty.  Say in New York, Roger Clemens is --
L:  Oh yeah.  Roger Clemens. --
R:  -- forty.
L:  -- I know him.
R:  He's an old guy --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- by baseball standards and he's still pitching.
L:  Now, how old is he?
R:  He's about forty.
L:  Oh, he's almost forty.  Okay.
R:  [NOISE] But the -- the -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the thing is that this is why a --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- lot of them use drugs too frankly --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- because they're trying to extend their -- their playing career --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with steroids and what not.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh dear.
R:  So, anyway um -- I mean, you know, in a way they're trying to make a certain amount of money while they can --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because after that they're never going to make that kind of money again.
L:  Right.
R:  Some --
L:  Right.  So, it's like it's the really limited -- [SIGH] I mean you could argue that about, you know, people in show business.  It's the same sort of thing.  It's like they really do have a very [SIGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- limited life span unless they're a character actor or something like that.  And it's kinda the same thing.  Unless they want to go --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I mean, how many of these guys really want to go into --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- coaching now?  Do you know what I mean?  Like --
R:  Well, or -- or can get in, or -- or do, say broadcasting.  You know, like being on TV --
L:  Right.
R:  -- as a commentator.  There's not that many spots.
L:  [NOISE] Except for, of course, Dick Button who's my favorite guy on --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I'm just kidding.
R:  Oh.
L:  You gotta love his voice.
R:  Oh, so you do watch that, huh? [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Gotta --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- gotta watch my figure skating but -- you know [NOISE] that's about it but he cracks me up.  But I like his voice though.  It's real calming.
R:  Right.
L:  But anyway, I -- no, I hear you though.  It's like --
R:  [SIGH] Well, see, I -- I don- -- I don't -- th- this whole thing about players' salaries it's like --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- somebody wants -- you know, baseball has problems and other sports h- have problems.  The ticket prices are outrageous.  I haven't been to a live game for five years --
L:  Really.
R:  -- because they're so expensive --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- now --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- but --
L:  How much are -- how much is it?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh well, on the cheap night, which is like Tuesday --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in the third tier, I think they raised it to like fifteen dollars.
L:  Oh my gosh.
R:  It used to be eight or twelve.
L:  [NOISE] And now how much is it like in a --
R:  Oh, for the other ones?  It's thirty -- [MN] -- it's like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- going to a jazz -- a show or worse than going --
L:  Like a -- like a -- like going to a Rock concert or something?
R:  Yeah, right.  I mean --
L:  Wow.
R:  I mean, look -- I love the Yankees --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and of course now in New York [MN] the only way --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you can see [MN] a lot of home games is, you have to have a s- -- buy a special cable --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- channel called the YES, which is Yankees Entertainment --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- which Steinbrenner dreamed up.  Yes.
L:  Of course.
R:  And -- and it -- it's -- and there's all -- there -- you wouldn't even want to know the +saga of the cable --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- licence and all this nonsense.  So, I go to the neighbors because I c- [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] I [MN] I don't blame you.
R:  -- and I can't buy a ticket and I can't afford the Yankee network. [LAUGH] 
L:  I -- I know.  It's like, that's a lot to ask.  I mean, that's --
R:  Oh he's a -- he's a genius.
L:  Yes, he is a genius.
R:  Ah, but he's also a hold up artist, you know. 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's not fair.
R:  So, to me it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- not such much players' salaries overall that are the problem, say with baseball --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or ticket prices.  It's the greed of the owners.  They want --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- these new ball parks.  They expect taxpayers to play -- pay for them --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then [NOISE] -- then they reduce the number of seats --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- [NOISE] and they increase the number of boxes which are the --
L:  Oh r- right. 
R:  -- pick -- where --
L:  The special boxes.
R:  -- they can rent out to corporations --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and do on at a very high price --
L:  Ach.
R:  -- so even though the Yankee Stadium, it's still there but they -- they ripped out some of the seats and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- they put in more boxes.  They all want that because --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- the corporations will pay whether anybody goes to the game or not --
L:  Oh, oh. [LIPSMACK] 
R:  -- because they have -- bring clients and nya, yeah.
L:  Oh, that's not --
R:  Yeah, it's -- it's --
L:  -- I mean, what about the original fans?  I mean --
R:  [MN] Ooh.
L:  Ooh.
R:  What a concept.
L:  You know, it's just like what about the -- I mean, this is like -- this didn't happen, what -- you know like --
R:  [MN] It didn't happen overnight. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's been going on and it's getting worse.
L:  [SIGH] That's not good.
R:  No.  So it -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it's um -- they had a golden calf and I think they've fattened it and now they're gonna kill it.
L:  Yeah, they've -- the golden goose, yeah.
R:  I mean, it sho- -- should players go on strike?  Well, look, I was not happy when they went on strike in I think it was ninety eight.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I was very unhappy, that destroyed the season.
L:  Yeah.  Right.
R:  Okay?
L:  I remember that.  Yeah.
R:  And -- and I'm -- I was very sorry about that [MN] but um  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- on the other hand, I -- I -- [NOISE] I'm for the right to strike generally and so I figure if bla- baseball players have a union --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they -- they should be able to exercise that right.  I mean --
L:  Yeah, I agree.
