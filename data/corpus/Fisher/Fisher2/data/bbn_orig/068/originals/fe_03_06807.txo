L:  [SIGH] Hi. --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- my name is Pat.
R:  [NOISE] Hi, [NOISE] I'm Nancy.  I live in New York.
L:  I'm in Montana.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh. [NOISE] 
L:  Did -- did you--
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- get the first part of what --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- she said the subject was?
R:  Um, yes.  It's about how we feel about strikes by professional athletes.
L:  [NOISE] Oh.  Okay.
R:  And whether or not we think they deserve the high salaries.
L:  Okay.  I got that second part but not the first part about the --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- strikes. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, first I -- first I thought she said stripes and I thought, "No, that can't be right". [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, I had a fan on -- it's really hot here and I had the fan --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- on and I couldn't quite hear what she said, [LAUGH] so 
R:  [NOISE] I wish it was hot here.  [SIGH] It's just cold and rainy.
L:  Mm.
R:  [NOISE] But, anyway um [LIPSMACK] I don't like the strikes.  I think that they ruin, um -- they ruin the game for the [SIGH] people who're watching it, the fans, and really I think that's what it should be about.  Not about people [SIGH] -- people and their egos.  [SIGH] And I know that they think they have really good reasons for striking but I really [MN] -- they get paid a lot of money.  I don't think that [NOISE] [MN] -- I just think that ruins the game. [NOISE] 
L:  I think I agree with you, um.  I think they're overpaid to begin --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- with but I'm also --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- not much of a sports fan --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- so, y- know, I don't follow it real closely.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Um, what I have seen of their salaries though is [MN] y- know, I think really out of line.  And I think that the high salaries make the ticket prices so high that normal people probably can't even afford to go.
R:  [LIPSMACK] That's true.
L:  So 
R:  [SIGH] It really is.  I remember when I was a kid -- my dad has always been a baseball fan so, um -- well, I mean he -- he's followed other sports too --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- but baseball is the main one --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and when I was a kid you could go to a stadium and see a game for oh, suppose a reasonable amount of money.  A few years ago my sister [SIGH] 's husband went --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- was going to go to a game and, just to get the nose bleed seats, [SIGH] I'm not sure exactly how much it was but it [NOISE] seemed to me like it was a really awful [NOISE] price.  About twenty dollars or [NOISE] something --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like that.  So, [NOISE] if you just go by yourself, you know you can maybe say, "Well, it's probably not any worse than maybe going to the opera or the ballet or something", [SIGH] but if you're taking your kid, [MN] which is what [SIGH] -- [LIPSMACK] to me that was just like the whole thing with -- [NOISE] -specially with baseball, probably basketball too.  But it's -- usually it's [SIGH] -- y- know if I was taking a son or [SIGH] a daughter or something [MN] and -- [NOISE] 
L:  Sure.  A family kind of thing.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And if -- if you're [SIGH] [NOISE] middle or low income it's just not feasible.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] [MN] Bu- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- then [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] [NOISE] I think it was in the eighties, baseball players went on a strike and for a long, long time after that [MN] baseball really didn't have the following that it had before that.
L:  I remember that.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  Oh, around here we only have just like a small, um -- I guess it's a professional team, but I don't know, y- know, how those work.  'Cause they're not like th- the big leagues you know [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or whatever it's called in baseball.  It's just like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I don't even know who these people play.  I've never been to one of the games, but [SIGH] it seems like so much of sports now is just about money.
R:  [SIGH] Right.  I- -- well [MN] I dunno if you saw on television but some kid just grad- well, he's -- I don't even know if he's graduated from high school yet.  He's graduating this year, and he's already got [SIGH] like ninety million dollars in endorsements already.
L:  Oh gosh.
R:  And to me that is just completely unreas- -- er, ah, y- know, it's ridiculous. [NOISE] 
L:  Ahah.
R:  See, he decided not to go -- he's a basketball player and usually they go through college and then they're drafted after college but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- he put his name in now.  He doesn't want to go to college.  He just wants the money --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- and the prestige [NOISE] [SIGH] I guess.
L:  Hah.
R:  But I think it's -- pretty sure it's Nike that he signed with --
L:  Wow.
R:  [NOISE] -- which -- I -- I don't know.  To -- to me, i- an- -- they get enough money with their salaries --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- and then the endorsements can just be --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- like Tiger Wood -- 
L:  Ahah.  Ha.  [SIGH] [NOISE] Well, I don- -- I guess that, y- know they should have the right to strike.  Everybody should if you're union or whatever, but if they do strike I -- I think that, y- know, it kinda should penalize them if all they're striking for is to get more and more and more money.
R:  Right.  Well, [SIGH] baseball players were gonna strike last -- was it last year or this year?  I forget.  Might've been this year.  But, um, they decided not to, which is I thought -- think was a good thing --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- but --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um, what th- -- it was about benefits I think and profit sharing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] So, [MN] you know, maybe it might benefit some of the [LIPSMACK] lesser known players --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but the -- the big names, I don't see how it's going to make any difference to them. [SIGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, someone like [MN] Roger Clemens --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- isn't gonna -- it's not gonna make any -- what difference is an extra million dollars gonna do for him? [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  What kind of benefits?  Just the profit sharing?  Was that the main thing?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, I th- --
L:  I mean we're --
R:  -- it was some [MN] 
L:  -- not talking like health insurance -- [LAUGH]
R:  No [LAUGH] --
L:  -- or dental and eye glasses. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- [LAUGH] I don't think so, but there -- there may have been --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- some other little, you know, perks involved but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I think the big thing was profit sharing.
L:  Hm.
R:  [SIGH] But I -- I can only really talk about baseball because that's the -- the only one thing that I follow --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- even loosely.  Well, [SIGH] my husband follows football in the fall but I think that, if I remember right, football has salary caps.
L:  Hm.
R:  Which I think is a good thing and I think baseball should have 'em too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But   [SIGH] So, you don't have a team where  [SIGH] like the Yankees where y- -- they can pay [NOISE] for, [SIGH] you know -- they can play -- pay lots and lots of money so they can get all the good players.  In -- in football they're more evenly distributed --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because -- they 
L:  Because of the caps. [NOISE] 
R:  Right.
L:  Hm.
R:  [NOISE] [MN] 
L:  Yeah.  I'd -- I'm not a good one to be talking much about sports. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Well, that's okay.  I -- I --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN] -- I live in New York and -- we -- it's not -- it's not really the same thing but it's similar so I think it's a little off topic but, okay.  [SIGH] We have a problem with the budget.  Every year --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the law makers don't want to pass the budget so they impose, [MN] um, [LIPSMACK] a thing on themselves to make them get the budget out faster where [SIGH] they won't get paid until the budget is actually out and approved.  But that really doesn't help because they know they're gonna get their money some day --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so maybe things are a little tight this -- this month, but they know that next month when they pass the budget -- although there've been years when we didn't have a budget [NOISE] -til August or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- September -- [SIGH] um, [SIGH] they still get their money. [NOISE] And I really think that what they ought do is they ought to make it so that, for every day that they don't have the budget passed, that they ought to get no money; that that salary should just be erased from the books.
L:  Ah.  Right. [COUGH] 
R:  It would save us so much money. [LAUGH] 
L:  Sure.  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  Hm.  Well --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- recently here --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the city council um, had something before them about th- this, um, little baseball team thing that we have here.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  They want to build a new baseball park.  Anyway, a couple years ago the city council donated a f- -- a million dollars to them to do some outlying stuff around this area, you know, like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- curbs and parking and you know, this kind of thing.  Well, then -- then now, two years later, they --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- still don't have enough money and they needed another million dollars --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and this is -- this is not for the actual --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- baseball field and that stuff.  It's just the o- outlying type stuff around it, you know, lighting and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, this kind of things.  And, I mean, the budget here is so tight, so -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- many people are unemployed [NOISE] and they went ahead and gave them another million dollars.
R:  [LIPSMACK] It's unbelievable.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yup.
R:  [NOISE] And yet my [MN] -- I was just visiting my sister [MN] last -- well -- yeah, last weekend -- so I -- I went to a couple of Little League type of games --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and [NOISE] they were -- yeah, the places where they're at, they had three or four different fields and [NOISE] everything and I noticed that park had been renovated probably about ten years ago [SIGH] but I -- it just seems to me like -- a million just seems like so much money --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it seems like you could do a lot of mone- -- well, I could do a lot with a million dollars. [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Mhm.  Yup.  Huh.
R:  [NOISE] I don't think I- -- um -- people just spend money like it's nothing.
L:  Ahah.  Well, I guess --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that what bothered me kind of about this -- this deal with the city is that it's not something that comes up for a --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- vote even, you know.  And there's -- I don't think that there's a large percentage of the population here that goes to these Osprey games and I think that, you know, if it's taxpayer money that's going for it that the taxpayer should have some say in it.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Should. [LAUGH]
L:  That it wasn't just the city council made the decision.
R:  [SIGH] Well, y- know this --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- is the reason why we're not under British Rules, because they had taxation without representation --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I think we're almost back to that.  Or maybe we are back to that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, it's getting that way.  Hm.
R:  [NOISE] [MN] It's +really a shame.  [SIGH] [PAUSE]
L:  Are you in, um, New York City or  State?
R:  [SIGH] No, I'm closer to Albany.
L:  Oh.
R:  About thirty miles south of Albany. [NOISE] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] So we hear all the -- we get -- you know, our news is the Capital -- Capital District stuff so we hear all the -- all the stuff about taxes and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- this person and that person -- [NOISE] everything.  [SIGH] And because they didn't [NOISE] pass the budget in time the school districts didn't have -- they couldn't pass their -- y- know, they couldn't decide on their budgets --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so one of the -- they finally did pass
