L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.  Hi, my name's Annette from -- I'm from Tucson, Arizona.
L:  I'm Dorothy.  I'm from Bloomington, Illinois.  It's kind of a tough topic today.
R:  Yes, it is.  I know.  Um, what -- what is going on?  I haven't been keeping up to date on the news about the Middle East.
L:  I have not either.  I do not have the television or anything on during the day.  Ah, we don't turn it on till evening.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So I have no clue what's going on over there.
R:  Yeah, me neither.  I haven't had time to watch it.  But as far as them ever having peace over there --
L:  Not in this generation.
R:  Yeah, it doesn't feel like it.
L:  I think that it's um, you know, the -- the -- it's so ingrained --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, they've had generations of this kind of stuff that the kids learn from the time they're little.  They're like the Irish.
R:  Right.
L:  That it's going to take generations.
R:  Mhm.
L:  For them to get away from this.
R:  Yeah, they need a -- need a new line of thinking.
L:  Yeah.  I really think so.  You know, there are probably some people who will do well with it, but I just can't imagine.  You know, if somebody came in and said to you, "Well now, all the things you've been taught all your life, you have to forget, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- "and you have to start over and do it this way."
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't -- I don't think there's many people that can do that.
R:  Yeah, I agree.  And I think with the US always putting their opinion into it, I think it's going to take longer if the US -- US keeps doing that, because you know, when someone's told to do something it seems like they fight against it even more.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  And I'm -- and I'm thinking if the US was to back out and let them come to the decision, probably the younger generation would start thinking on their own that we need to do this differently.
L:  Well, I don't know if you have children or not, but I know, you know, with -- I had three boys --
R:  Mhm.
L: -- and they would fight like you wouldn't believe until I would say to them, "Okay, take it out in the yard and settle it".  And it's amazing how fast their attitude changed when it didn't get them anything.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I -- I'm with you.  I really think that it's got to be -- they have got to do it.
R:  Right.
L:  They have got to realize that we are now a world society and that they have to either become part of it or they're going to lose.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But then, that's my opinion.
R:  Yeah, well I agree with you.
L:  And I think that there's so much religion involved in the whole thing.
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.  It seems like there's religion involved in -- with anything when it comes to a war.
L:  Yes, I do.  And I think, I don't know, but I think that this whole thing, we got into it too fast.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't know. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I think maybe this President Bush was trying to do something to impress his father.
R:  Oh.  Yeah, that's a good point.
L:  I think he was trying to do what his father didn't do when he was President.  But then, you know, that's just my opinion.  I think the man thinks he's doing the right thing.
R:  Right.  Yeah, that's true.  I know a lot of people would say, you know, well why are they so ungrateful that the United States tried to help everybody, but that's one thing, I don't know how I -- exactly how I feel about that because to me it's like when people weren't asking for the help, it's almost like United States has pushed themselves in there and started telling them what they need to do.  And that's not exactly being helpful if the people don't want their help, so --
L:  Well, what -- what would we do?
R:  Right.
L:  If one of these other countries came in here and told us how to live?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I agree with you one hundred percent there, you know what?  What right do we have?  Yeah, so it's a country that was oppressed and that their leader was a nasty person who needed to be removed, but you know, if the Is- -- Israeli people had said, well, or the I- -- you know, any of them had said, "Please come in and do this."
R:  Mhm.
L:  But as far as I know they never did.
R:  Right.
L:  But there again, it's a way of life.  They don't know anything different.
R:  Right.
L:  And I don't think you can cure it in -- by going in and saying, "Well, guess what folks, your world is overturned, get used to it."
R:  Yeah.  The same thing, like, if they were to come in here and do that to this country, people'd fight against it, because maybe the -- the way this government is being run, another country might not agree with it.  So you know, but if they came here and tried to change it, it -- it wouldn't go very well.
L:  No, it would not!  And yet, you know, these people are supposed to say, "Oh well, yes, you know, you're powerful.  You have come to liberate us, so we must have needed to be liberated."
R:  Right. [LAUGH] 
L:  And they probably did.
R:  Yeah, but it's an opinion, right.
L:  It -- it's just a matter of opinion and whose opinion counts.
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  So, um, but like I said, I heard -- when I heard the question, I thought, ooh.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Much harder than hobbies and exercise.
R:  Right. [LAUGH] 
L:  But I guess.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, especially if you haven't been keeping up with it.  I thought, this is going to be way too hard.  But --
L:  Well, I thought about it too, and you know, that's the one thing, when you call in, the other call, I had missed a couple of calls so I just called in --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and they tell you what the topic is before you put in your number, so that -- what day -- it was, ah, censorship.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And I really didn't want to get into that one because I'm not too sure how I feel.
R:  Right.
L:  About that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I heard this one today and I thought, well yeah, it is a tough topic but I know how I feel about it.
R:  Right.
L:  And it would be nice to see it all work out and everything be just fine, but there again, it's -- I don't think it's something that you're going to change that fast.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, I don't think so.  If anything, it's going to take a very long time for them.
L:  And they're going to have to start with the babies.  The ones that are babies now and rethink the whole thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But you can't do that until you get rid of the -- till the other people who are so vehement about it.
R:  Yeah, till they change their mind and --
L:  Well, until they're gone and there's another generation coming up.
R:  Yeah.  That's true.
L:  So 
R:  Yeah, that's a -- that's a big reason why I feel they'll still get there quicker if United States was to pull out, 'cause then, you know, I mean, even when they start, if the children start thinking, or the younger generation starts thinking, well we need to have more peace, we need to do this.  It's still going to be in their head, well, that's what the United States wants us to do, you know, that's what they want, so then I think it'll be harder.
L:  Well, and I think too that you're gonna see that a lot of people that were in power before, will end up in the new government.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, you know, maybe they can handle it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But it should be up to them to handle it.  And they're always going to say that it was all because of the oil.
R:  Oh yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And of course, the newspapers, the media, doesn't help.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, the media shows us what we want to see.
R:  And you know, I don't believe that that's all because of the oil.  Because it's also -- I mean, in Mexico they have more oil than -- than they can handle, you know, but United States doesn't try and do nothing over there.
L:  No.
R:  So, I don't know, I don't fall for that stuff.
L:  No, I don't think it is either, but I think that they're was a lot of politics in it, and as I said --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- yes, it was something that needed to be done, but did it need to be done so quickly and done the way that it was done and by United -- it -- and it wasn't all the United States --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but it will always be the United States is going to be blamed for it.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  You don't see anything in the papers about the other countries involved.
R:  Mhm.  I know, that is true, and then they were even pulling out of this one, France, and I don't think Germany was in it either.
L:  Yeah, oh no, oh no, France had nothing to do with it.
R:  Right.
L:  But um, and you know, that's another thing, France didn't want anything to do with it, so how many pe- -- people in this country are saying nasty things about the French?
R:  Mhm.
L:  How many people, like Letterman, make all these nasty jokes?
R:  Right.
L:  So, you know it has not just affected us, it's affected the relationship with the French.
R:  Yeah.  And it's interesting because they're claiming the United States is, you know, the um, country of freedom but then if you don't go along with what they want then you're outcast, right?
L:  Yep.  That's right.
R:  So.
L:  And it depends on who's in -- who's in and who's out and we'll see what the next election brings.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] That's -- who is running?  Um, have they said that yet?
L:  No.  They haven't decided yet.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  At one time they had said, ah, that Edgar, who was one of our former governors, were going to run but he pulled out.  He said, no, he was not going to run
