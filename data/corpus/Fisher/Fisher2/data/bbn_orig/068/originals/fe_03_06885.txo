L:  Hi.  I'm Pamela.
R:  Uh, Pamela, this is Art.  I'm in Los Angeles.
L:  Oh, I'm in Washington --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- State.  I'm right up the road.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, this is a --
L:  Have you --
R:  -- political question.
L:  -- done this before?
R:  Yeah, this is my third time.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  A little simpler questions before.  One was to make a holiday, the second one was to, uh, -- oh, it was -- it was an ethical question actually.
L:  Yes, morality one, yes.  I got those too [NOISE].
R:  Okay.
L:  This is a lot -- [NOISE] lot more complex.
R:  Yes, it is.  I try to keep away from politics and religion but, uh, since they asked, what do you think?
L:  Uh, one, is there going to be peace?  No.
R:  I agree there.
L:  Um, there's always going to be conflict.  Um, I have a Catholic -- not a Catholic, um, nondenominational background. --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, uh, mine is based on that and also, uh, it's just following suit because there's always going to be conflict there.  Um, [inaudible] will the US be able to bring peacekeeping?  Not -- if they do, it'll be for a short -- only while they're there.  Once they leave, it'll, uh, get worse again.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because they don't want democracy.
R:  Yeah.  I agree there.
L:  They like being told what to do and then they gripe about it.  Kinda sounds like us over here, huh?
R:  Yeah, so this last involvement, were you for pro or con?
L:  The what?
R:  Were you for -- for the last war?  I mean, you know, over in Iraq, I mean, Iran?
L:  Was I for it?
R:  Yeah, were you for it?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Only in the sense that the abuse -- the abuse that they were doing on the people were above and beyond.  That's -- that's like Hitler, man.  They, uh -- he was just -- it's horrible.
R:  Yeah, a dictator, yeah.
L:  You know, and then the abuse that was going on with the women and stuff.  That -- that's just not right so I mean, human -- being human is different than being an animal.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And being treated like an object versus a person.  We are people, you know.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  We should be treated a little bit humanely and he -- Saddam definitely did -- I think they should have got rid of him a lot [NOISE] when his Dad was in office [LAUGH] --
R:  Well, I guess --
L:  -- and his family [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I -- well this --
L:  -- and his sons.
R:  -- will change some policies in the future, like I said it's, uh -- they have to protect, uh, us and actually the world really from fanatics or terrorists or --
L:  Yeah, and we are -- we're gonna have more and more terrorists as we get involved unfortunately.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I agree there.
L:  Yeah, but, you know, I -- I -- we already have the terrorism now.  It's just -- it's all over in the east -- you know, the Middle East.  In our -- in our -- in the United States we've got the Klu Klux Klan and we've got the Skinheads and we've got Utah, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, we've got 'em, they're just not as extreme as it is over there.
R:  Yeah, I agree.
L:  What do you think?
R:  Well, I don't think there will ever be peace out there.  You know, like you said, the only time there'll be, uh, m- mild peace is when we -- when we do stay out there, you know.  They want us out or, you know, or else the UN could get more involved but they didn't get too involved lately so, uh, yeah.
L:  Getting more involved now.
R:  Uh, yeah, now that --
L:  Which is interesting.
R:  Yeah.  Well, it's just like France.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They want to get involved --
L:  I know [LAUGH].
R:  -- too, yeah.
L:  After the fact?
R:  After the fact, exactly.
L:  In other words, don't get their hands dirty and [several inaudible words].
R:  Hm.
L:  [LAUGH] Wouldn't want to be too committal.
R:  Yeah, I mean, we have to stay out there.  I mean, we just can't -- we can't let things get out of control again.
L:  No, because it does -- it does hit the economy, it does hit us, sooner or later and if you get some kind of weird person who's got nuclear weapons, who has an ax to grind, or thinks he does --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- then, uh, you know -- you know, it's like China, man, we'll at least we've got some leadership in there that's not ready to push the button.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Whereas Saddam he was definitely ready.  Do you think that he, uh, had anything to do with the towers?
R:  Um I think he -- he knew about it and he was probably -- it was a very -- yeah, I bet he was.
L:  Because I think he did because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there was a chain of command, you know what I mean?
R:  Oh, yeah.  They kept it secret for a long time.  I mean, they -- it was well -- well planned I guess.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Several years from what I understand [NOISE] but, uh, it came down too that, uh, what was it, one of his sons or whatever was a part of guiding that, making sure they had everything they needed.  Get your case, Naisha.  Go out that side [NOISE].  Oh.
R:  I went by Westwood just -- just driving by yesterday and they're picketing over the Federal Building, I guess, against people who are -- you know, for involvement in Iran, [several inaudible words] are out there.
L:  You know, all these people that are picketing and saying we shouldn't have went to war and stuff, you know, it's like look at Vietnam, you know.  We need to support our troops -- they've already been over there.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  You know, they've died for us.  W- why -- why turn around and slap 'em in the face?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  You know what I mean?
R:  I agree.  Yeah, that's when I went to school and actually that's when they dropped the draft was in ninety seventy two.  That was when Vietnam ended so I have a friend that did go to Vietnam and didn't come back.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  My Dad was in it and so was my, uh, -- he was in the Korean war too.  He got shot down.
R:  Hm.
L:  But, uh, yeah my whole family's military [NOISE].
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, yeah, I -- I just [NOISE] I think they should have got rid of him a long time ago [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  Well, hopefully we've learned our lesson.
L:  [MN] You really think so, huh?
R:  Well --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm an optimist, so ...
L:  We don't care of our people over here real well.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I agree there.
L:  I mean, look at -- 
R:  It's amazing.
L:  -- look at --
R:  The unemployment, the lack of health insurance.
L:  Actually it's the lack of people wanting to help and take responsibility themselves and the consequences of how they affect others, I think.
R:  Well, that and --
L:  [inaudible] ethics, morals.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  You know, you get down to the root of it.
R:  Old -- old, yeah old family -- family values that sort didn't change last thirty years I guess.
L:  And then neighbors don't even want to get to know each other.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, you stay on your side, I'll stay on mine.  You know what I mean?
R:  I hope -- I thought -- I though Washington was a little friendly.  I know Calif- LA's not.  LA's more of a transit town.
L:  Oh, well we are.  I mean, I know everybody in my whole two block radius --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, uh, that's just my personality.  Here.  It wasn't, uh --
R:  That's good.
L:  Go close your eyes and lay down, Naisha.  But, you know, it's -- it's still overall though in companies and so on, everybody is disposable.  Nobody is, uh, worth value.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Have you noticed that?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And you wonder why, uh, people have that kind of attitude.  Well, there's a good reason.  People are treated that way.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I can understand from that aspect but, uh, when you bring it to the Middle East, they just, uh, an extreme of what we could be.
R:  Well, hopefully -- yeah, I would -- we could be but I don't think we ever will be.  It's --
L:  No.
R:  No, no.
L:  We have too many religion -- different religious factions over here that are mellow, you know what I mean --
R:  Oh, yeah.  I agree.
L:  -- instead of aggressive and so, and they deal more with the Old Testament and religion has a lot to do with it [MN] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- than the New Testament which is very violent.  The Old Testament is ...
