R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  My name's Eve.
R:  Hi, ah, this is Marie.
L:  Lorrie?
R:  No, um, M.A.R.I.E.  Marie.
L:  Oh, what a pretty name.
R:  Oh, thank you.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, we're talking about airport security --
R:  Yeah, uh-huh.
L:  -- well, you know, it seems to me the more security we have in an airport the less chance we will have of terrorism.
R:  Really?  You think so?
L:  Yeah, I think so.  It just depends on, you know, whether the security, ah, measures they put in place are functional or not.  I mean, they can put there -- there are so many um, security measures they put in place that, um, aren't functional.  What's the use of wasting the money and the train- -- man power on them?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I never thought of it that way before.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, it makes sense.
L:  But you know -- yes, but if the security measure actually works --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- then it's worth twice the amount --
R:  Right.
L:  -- yeah, but you know --
R:  -- yeah, that's --
L:  -- I-- I've heard so many news, or seen so many news programs lately where, you know, reports have, like, snuck in things just to prove that the security's not good.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.  That -- that sometimes kind of frightens me, but I think it's also good for the security service to -- to realize that, you know, their service isn't working and that way they can improve it.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's true.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I never thought of that, you know, I thought maybe they just , you know, um, ah, put the security there, train the employees to use it and, you know, um, use it, you know.  So 
L:  Yeah, I think they should train the people more --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and pay them more.
R:  Yeah, I do too.
L:  Yeah, 'cause if they paid them more, the idea of losing a job that has a higher income than the idea of just losing a minimum job, wage job, the people would probably be more productive and -- and you know, more alert because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, if I were, you know, in a job where I was making six seventy five an hour and I got bored, it's like no big deal, I can get another job that pays the same amount.
R:  Right.
L:  But if I'm like making twenty five, thirty dollars an hour --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I might pay a little more attention because I don't want to lose this job.
R:  Right, that's true.
L:  You know.  Yeah.
R:  I'm glad, you know, the um, you know, they have, um, you know, that type of security there, you know, like the scanners and all that?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, um, oh, because I think I -- I read an article, ah, I think it was about several months ago where um, they caught a lot of, you know, weapons going through, like this that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and you know, and I think that was great, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And ah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think it needs some more security, you know.
L:  Mhm.  I also think they should probably start limiting the size of ha- -- ah, carry on's.  You know, to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like, you know, men and women the size of a ladies handbag.
R:  Right.
L:  I then you can really um, you know, that would be something that would be easier to -- to search, and anything else just, you know, would have to go through the main baggage area --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and that stuff can get irradiated and xrayed and, you know --
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, um, ah, I haven't flown, you know, over the last several months, you know, not because of that because of other things --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but ah, ah, I'll probably fly you know, more now, and you know, I'll get a chance to see first hand, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- how it works and everything like it is, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I've heard it -- it you know, it's -- it's sort of, you know, you have a long waiting period because of the, ah, security measures they take now and, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, hopefully, you know, ah, they have a faster way to, you know, get your luggage checked and all that, you know.
L:  Yeah, but when it -- when it comes down to it wouldn't you rather spend a little bit more time and be more sure you're going to be safe?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Than be whisked through and, oh oh. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] [several inaudible words]
L:  Yeah, you know.
R:  Yeah, that's true though.
L:  Yeah.  I haven't been on a plane lately, but the last time I traveled I took a -- a greyhound --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they searched every inch of my luggage --
R:  Really?
L:  -- and ah, you know, ah, put a metal detector over it, a metal detector all over me, you know, and I felt really secure getting on that bus after that.
R:  Oh that was good.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  When did that occur?
L:  Um, oh, probably some time last November, I think.  I took a -- I took a long bus ride --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and it was like, you know, I felt completely secure.
R:  Mm.  I didn't go through that, you know, all that kind of, ah, security measure when I rode a bus because I think the last time I rode one also was ah -- ah, in November of last year, and they, you know, I didn't, ah, get checked or anything.
L:  Oh really.
R:  I don't know why, you know.
L:  [LAUGH] Well it could be because of the -- the location I'm living in --
R:  Could be.
L:  -- I'm living in San Diego and there's a lot more military stuff going, you know, on here --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so they're probably far more --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I don't -- what area do you live in?
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  Yeah.  There are a lot of military -tary targets here so, you know, they're probably just a little bit +fussier.  Which make me feel glad.
R:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  I've been there, it's a beautiful city.  I love it.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  It's very beautiful.
L:  Yeah, this is where I live.  I can't afford it but I live here anyway.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  What area do you live in?
R:  Ah, Louisiana's my home state, but um --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I'm getting ready to relocate, but ah, and so therefore, you know, I have to deal with the ah, security measures again too, so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- yeah.
L:  Yeah, I've always wanted to visit Louisiana, but I've never been able to make it yet.
R:  It's nice.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's very, you know, friendly, you know, it's homey, you know, it -- it's all about family.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, that's what it's about, family.
L:  Yeah, San Diego's a friendly area --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ah, communities than -- say Los Angeles is.  So it's kind of nice.
R:  Yeah, it is nice.
L:  Yeah, but um, [LAUGH] I mean, how long can you really talk about airport security?  We've discussed it.
R:  Eight minutes. [LAUGH] How many minutes, ah, have passed?
L:  You know, I should have checked the timer.  I don't know.
R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  Huh?
R:  Pardon me?
L:  I'm sorry, I didn't hear that last thing you said.
R:  Oh, I was looking at the clock and I was saying, well maybe I should have timed myself.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Oh --
R:  But ah, you know, ah, ah, that is a very, ah, big, you know, is -- is a big issue and it's important right now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, because of all the, you know, terrorist alerts and all that, and ah --
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  -- but ah, there's more than airport security, you know, also, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, um, ah, I see everyday things --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, like, you know, ah, driving, you know, down the street or somewhere like that, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that can happen anywhere, now.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  It's just, you know, the -- the high profile things like airports.  Anything that's traveling, you know, they get more attention, but I -- I think we're all more alert about security issues now, you know, if something weird's going on we tend to check it out more than we used to.
R:  Right.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's good in a way.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  You know, I'm -- I'm just a little sorry, you know, that had to happen, you know, to make us more aware of, you know, to do things like that though, but --
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  -- it's for the -- you know --
L:  It -- it well, times are getting scarier.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  It -- it reminds me -- I don't know how old you are, but I was, you know, born back in the fifties so I remember all that cold war stuff --
R:  Really?
L:  -- and it's like, yeah --
R:  Oh, that's great.
L:  Yeah, you know, and it's like that cold war stuff starting to come back again, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Being worried about other people and what they're going to do and, you know, security -- security's important.
R:  Yeah, it is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  You don't sound like you were born, you know, ah, during the fifties or something like that.
L:  No, I don't, I know [LAUGH] 
R:  No, you sound like -- I'm only thir- -- well I'm thirty nine, I nearly said thirty seven. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I'm fifty one. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, you don't sound like it.
L:  No, in fact I still get people asking me for my mommy. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Because I have a very young voice, it's like, you know, "Can I talk to your mother?" and it's like, "I am my mother." [LAUGH] 
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That'll be neat.
L:  Hm?
R:  That should be neat in a way, you know, to get complimented like that a lot.
L:  Yeah, it is.  I -- I -- I -- I think I stay pretty young, you know.
R:  That's good.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean -- I -- I -- I credit it to all the preservatives in the food that I eat. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Preserves me. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] That's a good one.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well maybe they -- you know, it's probably good for something. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, all the preservatives and, ah, but ah, I guess eight minutes are up now, so 
L:  Hm?
R:  Um --
L:  We have a bad connection here because -- or your voice is very soft or something, because I keep missing things you're saying.
R:  Yeah, I think it's, um, the phone connection over here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, bad connection.  I don't know why --
L:  What airports do you have near you?
R:  Ah, Metro, Baton Rouge Air -- I mean, airport and ah, Loui- -- um, Louis Armstrong.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah, it's an international airport.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, we've got the San Diego International airport here and then a couple of little tiny airports around the area too.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, I went on vacation there and
