L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, this is Gina.
L:  Hi, my name's Julia.
R:  Hi Julia.
L:  Hi.
R:  How're y- doing?
L:  [NOISE] Ah, pretty good. [LAUGH] [NOISE] What's up? [NOISE] 
R:  [MN] Not much.  Is this the first [inaudible] you've done this?
L:  [NOISE] Ah, yes it is.
R:  [LIPSMACK] This is the second time that I've done it.
L:  Okay.  So I -- I'm not exactly sure exactly what I'm doing but I was just wondering what the subject is.  That's what I'm told to ask ya. 
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  The subject is um, strikes by professional athletes.  Do you think --
L:  Professional --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- athletes.
R:  -- athletes -- do -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you think --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- professional --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- athletes are paid too much money?
L:  Yes I do. [NOISE] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I agree.
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  But I don't know anything about strikes by recent -- by recent professional athletes.  Do you?
L:  No, no --
R:  I mean 
L:  -- and I haven't been really keeping track of sports at all.  So I --
R:  Yeah, me neither.
L:  -- but I -- but I really do think, either way, they're like way over paid.
R:  Yeah.  Absolutely.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Absolutely.  I uh --
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  -- well, I go to Duke and um the basketball coach there is --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- the highest paid um professional on staff, and he --
L:  Really?
R:  -- mm, yeah.  He gets paid a hundred and thirty, no, one million three hundred thousand dollars a year.
L:  [NOISE] That's insane.
R:  I know -- 
L:  [NOISE] It's --
R:  -- and four hundred thousand of that --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- is just his benefits.  [NOISE] 
L:  Oh man --
R:  A hundred and --
L:  -- so that's how many tuitions?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, exactly.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, what -- probably -- I don't know -- probably like ten or something.  But -- [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] [NOISE] 
R:  So, have we exhausted that topic of conversation? [LAUGH] 
L:  I -- I -- I don't even know what I'm supposed to be doing right now. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  You know, I really don't think it matters what we talk about.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Um --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- because they're just -- it's just a discourse analysis for how strangers --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- approach conversation with each other, so --
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  -- we can get off topic.
L:  All right.
R:  And it would[?] [LAUGH] --
L:  So ah, so are we supposed to talk about college sports or  is like can it be professional stuff or ? [NOISE] 
R:  Well, I think it's professional sports because college -- college --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- students don't really get paid any money so they --
L:  Right.
R:  -- can't strike.  I don't think --
L:  All right, so -- so like what's your favorite sport?
R:  What's my favorite --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- sport?  Um --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  -- well, to watch --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it's probably --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- basketball.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  And um --
L:  [NOISE] To play? [NOISE] 
R:  -- yeah.  I don't -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- what is that?  Well, probably softball to play [LAUGH] or soccer.
L:  Softball is so much fun. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.  Do you play softball? [NOISE] 
L:  I used to be a catcher. [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, I used to be a catcher too. [LAUGH] 
L:  Really?  
R:  Isn't that funny?
L:  So we're like twins.  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  But a long time ago.  I -- I haven't played softball a long time.
L:  [NOISE] I played --
R:  Um.
L:  -- I was in this big tournament last year and like I won -- they used to call me Stretch 'cause I have long arms.
R:  Wow. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
R:  That's really cool.
L:  I know you --
R:  Did you --
L:  -- really need to know this because, like, yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But, you know.  It's -- it's good that you're in Duke and all.  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.  I don't know anything about --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- Duke's softball team -- 
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:   -- unfortunately. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] You don't play sports in school? [LAUGH] 
R:  No, I'm a grad student so 
L:  Did you play sports in school?
R:  No, I didn't.  I was a dancer actually.
L:  [NOISE] No kidding?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I danced for seven years. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.  What kinda dance?  Ballet?
L:  Ballet, tap and uh, something else.  [NOISE] Gymnastics --
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  -- something like that.  [NOISE] 
R:  Me too.
L:  +No -- I don't know.  I was just like [SIGH] it got me all like, you know, limber and stuff [NOISE] but otherwise, you know  [NOISE]  I don't plan on being a professional dancer any time soon. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.  I, uh, actually took a year off --
L:  [NOISE] [COUGH] 
R:  -- right when I hit puberty and when I --
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- went back to it my sense of balance was --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [MN] you know, off, because my body had grown so much that I was never really very good at it any more.  So I just did it for fun.
L:  Yeah.  See, that's what I'm saying.  I was way too large to be a dancer.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] Pretty tall girl. [LAUGH]
R:  Yup.  So --
L:  So, I didn't um --
R:  -- what're you doing now?  Do you work or are you in --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- school or ?
L:  [NOISE] I w- -- work.  I go to school.  The whole nine.  I do everything.
R:  How did you --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- find out about this ah --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- this telephone program?
L:  Through, like, one of my friends.  I dunno -- like an on line thing I guess. [NOISE] 
R:  Huh.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] I dunno.  I don't -- I still don't even know like what the deal is or  [LAUGH] [MN] [NOISE] 
R:  Well, everything is interesting 'cause I -- I was a linguistics major in college so I heard about it through --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- like a professional list there that I'm on.
L:  [NOISE] Huh. [NOISE] 
R:  But -- so, I'm always curious how other people --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- have come across it. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  It's interesting.
L:  [NOISE] So was the last person you talked to interesting at all? [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.  Our topic was um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- oh it was like war in the Middle East.
L:  Oh man --
R:  Something like that.
L:  -- I'm glad I didn't get that one.
R:  [LAUGH] No? [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  It was --
L:  I could talk your ear off for ten hundred hours. [LAUGH] 
R:  Really?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Well, I mean uh -- [SIGH] like on my stupid opinions 'cause I think everyone else has the same opinions as me so I -- I -- [NOISE]
R:  Well, what do you think about it? [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Oh, what do I think about it?  I -- I think that um [LIPSMACK] it's pretty [NOISE] junky.  It should have been dealt with earlier and, at this point, it's something that had to be done, but it's so ridiculous.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm actually doing -- 
L:  I --
R:  -- a project, um.  It's ironic --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that I had that topic a couple of months ago because --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I didn't know anything --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- about it then -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- but now I have an internship --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and I'm studying reconstruction in Iraq.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, no kidding? [NOISE] 
R:  It's amazing.  Yeah.  The US is doing such a [NOISE] botched up job.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  It's really bad.
L:  [NOISE] Hey, I don't know.  I think any time you drop [NOISE] -- you drop bombs with kids [NOISE] -- with them to help -- you're like you know, blow someone up and then you know, save their cousins. [NOISE]  What's the deal?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Bombs and band aids.
L:  [NOISE] I don't even know [NOISE] but, um [LIPSMACK] I don't know -- how -- like i- --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- not that I don't want to talk to you or anything, but like how long does this go on for? [COUGH]
R:  Uh -- so at ten minutes um we get cut off and --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, it tells us -- it tells you that it's over and then --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it gives you two seconds to say -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- goodbye.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  You know, to --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- end the bond that --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- we've created with each other --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and um -- and I think they've changed it now since the last time I did it so then afterwards you can give feed back.
L:  You can do feed back? [NOISE] 
R:  Yes.  Where you can kinda --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- rate your --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- uh, your experience I guess.
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  I don't -- I don't really know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- 'cause I didn't -- I wasn't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- able to do that the last time I participated.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  But -- so when you picked up the phone, they didn't tell you what our topic of conversation was?
L:  Right.  Um [LIPSMACK] Well, not -- I think that I kinda like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- took yous by surprise because I started being like gormless [LAUGH] [several inaudible words].  As soon as I picked up I was asking like nine hundred questions so  [NOISE] And I -- I don't think until like actually I asked -- 'cause like my friend was in the car with me and she's done this before so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE] -- she was like, [NOISE] "Ask what the subject is".
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Whatever.  I probably ruined it.  If you gonna get in like [NOISE] -- in trouble for that, [NOISE] tell them I was dumb. [LAUGH] 
R:  No, no, no.  We're just doing this together.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I don't know -- I don't know these people either.
L:  Oh.
R:  Nobody gets in trouble.  We just get a ten dollar check. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh right, yeah.  That's what she was telling me. [LAUGH] 
R:  The -- the -- the object of the study is not what we're -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the topic that we're discussing but --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- how we interact with each other.  Like how --
L:  So are -- are we being recorded?
R:  -- we negotiate the fact that we don't know each other.  Yeah.
L:  Oh, we are?
R:  Yeah.  We're being recorded and they're gonna study our conversation later.
L:  Oh man.  [LAUGH] [NOISE] I think uh --
R:  So don't tell me you work for the CIA. [LAUGH] and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- don't confess your, ah --
L:  No man.  I -- I'm clean. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- murderous past. [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm so good. [NOISE] So --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I --
R:  That's the whole point of the study.  Is to tape record our conversations and like --
L:  Oh man. [NOISE] 
R:  -- analyze them later.
L:  We should have given them pretty -- uh, something pretty interesting to [NOISE] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- to record.  You could -a gotten raunch with this. [LAUGH] 
R:  Hm.  I don't think I know you well enough for that. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I know, right. [LAUGH]  For years I would do something like that.  That's so me [NOISE] but uh, I don't know, I think we're pretty successful in this so far.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  So, you're in your car driving?
L:  [NOISE] Oh, well actually I just got out and I'm at a Boston market now. [LAUGH]  I don't know -- do -- do they have Boston markets wherever you happen to be? [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.  I'm in DC.  They've got 'em all over the place.
L:  [NOISE] Right.  Yeah.  So I'm at a Boston market -- I just pulled in and I'm gonna eat corn bread.  Like it's my job. [LAUGH] 
R:  I love their corn bread.  Mm.
L:  [LAUGH] Isn't this the best thing ever?
R:  Very good.  Yes.
L:  Yeah.  And then I'll probably have cookies. [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
R:  Mm.  So you're gonna have corn bread and cookies for dinner? [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Probably.  All -- I mean -- all I think what I've eaten today -- I've had cookies already.  I don't know.  I just like manage to eat whatever I want and not get fat so I'm gonna take advantage of it until I get old. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  That is a very good plan.
L:  [NOISE] Oh yeah.  And then [NOISE] like, you know, I can't wait 'til I'm like, pregnant and then like, old [NOISE] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- because those are the times when I can eat whatever I want. [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
R:  So, you basically are gonna live your whole life eating whatever you want. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, pretty much.
R:  They'll be like ten ye--
L:  I mean, I plan on getting fat at some point but then I'll just lose it, so ... [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] That sounds like a very good plan.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I'm smart like that.  You actually sound exactly like my friend, Paula.  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's funny.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, are you in college?
L:  Ah, yeah.  
R:  [MN] 
L:  I'm in college right now doing -- studying film production.  [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, wow. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah, I'm trying to be an actress too. [NOISE] 
R:  What kind of film? [NOISE] 
L:  Well, it's like uh, you know -- I dunno -- just -- they don't do [NOISE] a specific kind but like I'm -- I write Shakespearean plays and stuff [NOISE] and I go on auditions and stuff.  Anything pretty much having to do --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- with film or theatre I'm into. [NOISE]
R:  That's awesome.  So some day you might get famous and I'll never --
L:  I -- 
R:  -- even know that I talked to you.
L:  I know. [LAUGH] [LIPSMACK] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  And that's gonna suck.  I'm gonna be -- like one day I'll just run into you or something [SIGH] [NOISE] and I'll just be like, "Yeah, your voice sounds really familiar" [LAUGH] -- I don't even know. [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] Or maybe I'll see something about you on E and they'll talk about how you used to dance and you were a softball catcher --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and I'll be like, "Eh".
L:  [LAUGH] "Well, hold on a second. I know that girl". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  What're you doing in school? [NOISE] 
R:  Hm? [NOISE] 
L:  What're you doing in school?  Like you was talking about. [NOISE] 
R:  I'm uh -- I'm getting my Master's Degree in Public Policy.
L:  [NOISE] In public what?
R:  In public policy.  It's like a business degree --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- for working with the government --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- basically.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, that's cool.  So, you're gonna be like, [NOISE] hard core? [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
R:  Kind of I guess. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  This is the first year -- I still have an internship this summer and it's the first year --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I've worked all the way through the --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- summer vacation.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  I'm not a big fan. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Not a big fan.  [NOISE] 
L:  [MN] 
R:  I want my summer vacation back. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.  Well, I'm actually gonna San Francisco [NOISE] --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- [several inaudible words] in the next -- on the seventeenth so [NOISE] this is the first year I'm going away since I was, like, a little kid.  So --
R:  Cool.
L:  -- [NOISE] it's exciting.  I've never been to California before. [NOISE] 
R:  Do you have a place to live?
L:  Ah, well, my brother lives out there so -- [NOISE] 
R:  Uh, great.
L:  It'll work for me.  [LAUGH] 
R:  You'd have a free place sorta --
L:  And I'm dragging my sister with me [NOISE] so it'll be the three of us.
