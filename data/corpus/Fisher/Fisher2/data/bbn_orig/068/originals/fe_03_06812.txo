L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Hello --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- this is Marian Webber.
L:  [NOISE] Hi, this is Clorise Marshka, [NOISE] and --
R:  I'm from Minnesota.
L:  [NOISE] Okay.  [SIGH] And ah, this is [MN] my first time participating in this.  Um, it's um -- the topic is the recent strikes from the uh -- in the base- -- in the um, football field.  Um, how you feel about that.  [LIPSMACK] And do you think they get paid too much money or [LIPSMACK] is it fair -- a fair amount of money?
R:  I feel that the athletes are all making too much money -- the professional ones. [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] I think so too.  Ah, you know, I know that they're [MN] -- there's a lot that goes into it -- [MN] um being i- -- I'm in the medical field so um, [LIPSMACK] I believe that [SIGH] you know, they have a lot of injuries that [MN] could be, you know, not life threat- -- well they could be life threatening, but also they could be [SIGH] permanent um, type, um, injuries that [NOISE] they need to be compensated for, but I think that should be separate from their salary, [MN] y- know? [NOISE] 
R:  Yes I agree.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I can't see anyone making as much money as some of these athletes do. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  I mean, when you think of s- -- ah, um [LIPSMACK] --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- and I -- and I -- I don- -- I don't know a whole lot about it.  I guess, um, the athletes are paid by, um, [MN] you know -- someone buys a team, you know -- a person buys a team and -- and maybe they're wealthy and they just need an investment for their money, um, and that could be it.  'Cause big corporations do buy teams and, um -- and I know that some of the money's generated in the stands, you know, but not -- not their yearly salary I wouldn't think.
R:  Right.  And the way some of 'em act I don't know. [SIGH] [MN] 
L:  Yeah.  I don't know either.  Um [SIGH] but [PAUSE] them going on strike, I don't -- you know, I don't really think that's appropriate either because, um -- I mean I know that there are a lot of people that are v- -- v- -- um, [NOISE] you know, really ah, dedicated sports fans but, um, the purpose of striking is to negotiate their salaries and -- and negotiate, um, different things in their contracts um, but I -- I -- I just don't believe in -- in going on strike to obtain that.  [SIGH] Um, but that -- I guess that falls in because they're part of a union and the union tells them, you know, "You need to stop working, ah until you get what you want or c- -- or comprise, meet half way --" 
R:  Right.
L:  "-- meet 'em half way".
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH] So um, [SIGH] -- I -- I just don't agree with that.  I don't agree with any [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] you know type of st- -- strike, whether it's in, you know, athletics strike or teachers' strike or um [LIPSMACK] -- because all that does is hurt the consumer.
R:  That's right.
L:  You know, when the airline strikes and -- and it costs so much money for them to be out of business and you wonder if they could ever, um, really [NOISE] um recoup from that --
R:  Right, it driv- --
L:  -- you know, loss.
R:  -- it drives all the prices up in the end for everybody.
L:  I -- I think so.  I think um it -- it's reflected in our airline prices and [SIGH] you know, you -- you can travel at the -- you know, they -- they raise the prices during the peak times of the year --
R:  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  -- and -- to make up for, um, their losses, so it's always passed on to us.
R:  Right.
L:  I think.
R:  We're always caught in the middle.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  And I don't agree with teachers' strikes either because they don't benefit the students any.
L:  No, no.  [SIGH] And uh, you know, I was watching, ah, a television show the other night about, um, a school up north that -- and I don't remember where it was 'cause I kinda got in on it at the last minute [SIGH] -- but um, [NOISE] they had had a substitute all year [SIGH] and sometimes those subs don't even major in anything.  I mean --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- they're -- sometimes they're housewives, um, you know.  They're -- if they have college, the only requirement to be a substitute teacher is to have ah sixty hours college credit, and um [MN] so it doesn't -- and it doesn't matter how long ago you had those credits.  You know, you could've gone to school ten years ago and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you can become a substitute. 
R:  Right. 
L:  [NOISE] And my feeling about you know [SIGH] the teachers going on strike and bringing in subs is that the children are the ones that suffer because they're not getting the education that they should and, like this class had, [SIGH] um, y- know, subs all year in math --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- and they felt cheated.
R:  Well, I'm sure.
L:  They felt [SIGH] -- they [LIPSMACK] were going over the same stuff [LIPSMACK] repeatedly.  They weren't moving on to new stuff [SIGH] um, because the sub didn't know how to teach the new stuff.
R:  Right.
L:  And you constantly have to have continuing education to be able to teach today, because they've changed school and they've even changed maths drastically since I went to school.  They use different terminology than we did and, um, you know they have different -- different math.  We didn't have calculus --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in high sch- -- in school [MN] -- um, in -- in high school and ah -- but th- -- today the te- -- the kids are [SIGH] -- are getting into algebra in the middle school instead of high school, and also um, high -- you know, high honors math an- --
R:  Mm, right.
L:  -- you know  [SIGH] 
R:  Right.  I -- I've said many times I don't think I'd make it through school [LAUGH] this day and age. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Different from when I went to school.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I work in a school.  I'm bookkeeper so [LAUGH] I kinda deal --
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  -- with a lot of that stuff 
L:  Oh, do you?
R:  Yeah, yeah.  And I 
L:  [NOISE] Well -- well how did they work it when your teachers go on strike?
R:  We have never had that problem.
L:  Oh.
R:  They have always managed to settle right before the deadline.
L:  That's good.
R:  And -- but they've ended up with a lot of stuff that's kind of ridiculous too, but [MN] I suppose in the long run it was worth it but [SIGH] now in this day and age when there's no money for the school districts and they've got all these frills added in there you can't get a rid of 'em either.
L:  Oh, I know.  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] Yeah, um [MN] I -- y- know. [LIPSMACK]  I have friends in the school system too and, um, one of 'em was not rehired.  She'd only been teaching a year and -- and they did not rehire for the next school year an- -- so that really put a damper on her whole ah career and she's not even teaching now.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  But um, [SIGH] [MN] she's a good person.  She just has a very strong personality [LIPSMACK] and says what's on her mind and a lot of people don't like that.
R:  Right, right.
L:  She's always honest and you know where she stands but -- and if you didn't know her she would be -- she would come across real [LIPSMACK] strong.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH] But um   you know, I guess, in getting back to the --
R:  Sports. [MN]
L:  -- athletes getting paid too much -- um, I think that, um, if you look at all the sports, like, take boxing for instance, um, I think boxing would probably be a, um -- I would expect a high salary for boxing because [SIGH] [MN] of the life -- you know the --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- the -- the consequences of -- of fighting and getting knocked around and um possible brain injuries and so forth.  [NOISE] You know.  But --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and football can be rough.
R:  Right.
L:  I always watch football and it can be pretty rough on a person too [LIPSMACK] so, um.  But I think the salaries are way, way out of line.  You know, I don't know, ah, what makes a human being that valuable.
R:  I don't know either.  Don't [LAUGH] --
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
R:  -- make sense to me -- [LAUGH] at all.
L:  And it's like, you know, their insurance -- their life insurance must be outrageous and -- and it must have a -- a really big amount of life insurance [SIGH] um.  And again, if -- if someone did die on the field, um, that would be bad for all the athletes and -- and the insurance companies too.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, it could wipe out a -- a -- you know, an insurance company to have a -- a loss like that.
R:  Right.
L:  'Cause you know that they have to insure 'em for a lot.
R:  And on the other hand they make it -- they spend it too and they still don't have any money.
L:  Yeah.  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] Yeah.  And um [MN] [LIPSMACK] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I -- you know -- and I -- I guess -- I -- I know that some of the players, some of the athletes [SIGH] do a lot in the community and they do uh give a lot of their salary -- you know, some of their salary -- a lot of it to char- -- charity, um --
