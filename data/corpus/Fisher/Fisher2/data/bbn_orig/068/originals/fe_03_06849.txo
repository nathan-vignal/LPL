R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  Hello.
R:  Hi. [LAUGH]. Ah, my name's Beth.
L:  I'm Kim. 
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  What part of the country are you in?
R:  I'm in Canada.
L:  Oh, you are --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- not even in the country. 
R:  No. [LAUGH] 
L:  And you hear what they say about Canadians.
R:  Well, I don't know, we probably --
L:  [LAUGH] I'm just kidding. 
R:  I know, we say the same thing about Americans -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- so ... [LAUGH]
L:  It's all right --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I -- I try to -- after George Bush got elected, I tried to move to Canada. 
R:  [LAUGH] I can understand that. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, yeah.
L:  Oh --
R:  So, um [LIPSMACK] --
L:  I've done this experiment twice and they always give questions where people have the same response, so whatever you say, I -- I have the [NOISE] opposite sentiment. 
R:  Oh, oh.  I see.
L:  So [several inaudible words].
R:  I've only done it once before, so I didn't know if it was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, how it -- how it works, 'cause I think the top- --
L:  No, I -- it's not how it works, but just every single time I've done this --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they've given me a question where the -- it's like -- so the first one I had, it was, like, if you're in a terrorist attack, like, would you be afraid?  And we're both like, "Yes". 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And then there was no debate.  So, and then the second time it was something about, like, censorship or something, and I was just like --
R:  Oh, yeah. 
L:  -- "Yeah".  I was like --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- "Yeah, whatever".  So, um, whatever you say, I'm taking the -- I'm taking the devil's advocate say --
R:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH] Well, I personally think the security at the airport does help with --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- protect against terrorists, so ...
L:  And -- and why is that?  I actually -- to be honest, I -- I would have -- even without taking devil's advocate, I -- I would have to disagree. 
R:  Well, I don't know, I figure it's gotta do so- -- you know, some protection.  I mean, certainly, I'm not saying it's a -- it's a guarantee.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  It's not a guarantee --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but I think the fact that they're being more careful in that, as long as they are actually, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- being more careful.  You know, 'cause you hear about some things at the airport that are not the way they should be happening. [LAUGH] 
L:  Mm.
R:  I guess is -- is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what I'm thinking.  So ...
L:  Like --
R:  You know. 
L:  -- it's -- clearly security is -- is never a bad idea.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  You can't deny that security is a bad idea.
R:  Oh, no, of course not.
L:  But they're taking all these extra precautions and extra measures --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but they're not carrying them out in a successful manner.
R:  I have --
L:  And, like --
R:  -- I have to agree with you, you know, like, it -- somewhat with that because, um, you know, certainly not everybody is going to be on the ball, shall we say, when it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- comes to --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- the security.
L:  Brass knuckles aren't even legal, and I -- like, you -- you're not even allowed to legally have brass knuckles and I managed to get through airport security with brass knuckles on.
R:  Are you serious?
L:  [NOISE] In my back pocket.
R:  Oh, jeeze. 
L:  [LIPSMACK] But on the other hand, my friend got harassed in [inaudible] for having, like, nail clippers or something.
R:  My boyfriend had nail clippers taken away from him.
L:  Yeah, they took them away.
R:  And not because they're, ah, they're a dangerous weapon, I guess, I don't know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  A- -- his question was, what was he going to do --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- cut people up in little pieces with them or ...? [LAUGH] You know --
L:  Yeah, that --
R:  -- just seemed --
L:  -- that happened with my old roommate. 
R:  Yeah, it just seemed like kind of a little bit too much, you know, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so, ah --
L:  [NOISE] And they claim, like, [NOISE] too, like, better too much than too little, but apparently it's all by what you look like, and there's a lot of racism involved. 
R:  Oh, I can imagine, yes.
L:  And -- 
R:  I mean, I -- I think it doesn't matter what you do.  I think in a -- a lot of cases, racism has a lot to do with the way people are treated. 
L:  [NOISE] I think the most interesting thing, though, was, I know increased airport security may prevent terrorism in airports, but it -- it will not prevent terrorism. [LIPSMACK] That just means that they need to -- it's like they're not going to attack the World Trade Center again. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  They're not gonna -- they're not smart -- like, I wouldn't attack a- -- you know, like, airports aren't a thing of -- like, of A- American pride. 
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  Like, if -- if I -- if I were a terrorist, like, this is an awful thing to say, like, what are the things I would attack?  The Lincoln Memorial, like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- things of American pride, and they're not going to use airports because that -- that's been done, like, it's -- it's too easy to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- predict and plan for and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- regardless of airport security, th- -- it's not going to prevent terrorism.
R:  Mhm, you're -- ah, you're right, actually.  It just, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it might ter- -- prevent terrorism in certain places, but it's not going to prevent it overall.
L:  It may prevent people from using air -- airplanes again.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.  I mean --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- well, I -- I -- I mean, it's the same as, like -- well, they -- the death penalty doesn't prevent murders. 
L:  [NOISE] Well --
R:  Um --
L:  -- if you really don't care about the consequences.
R:  That's right.
L:  It's similar, but I would define- -- I would have to contend that it is also -- it's different, it's way different.
R:  Oh, mhm.  Mhm.  Well, I think --
L:  Um --
R:  -- with terrorists, I mean, they're -- they're brought up to -- in -- in with that frame of mind.
L:  Yeah, I mean, anyone who is willing to -- to give their life, like, to -- like, is so opposed to something that they're willing to give their -- their lives and [NOISE] put their lives at stake, like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I -- I don't really think that airport security a- and life in prison is, um, anything that will thwart their task.
R:  No, it's not a deterrent.  It's, um --
L:  [NOISE] You know. 
R:  -- it -- it would be nice if it was, but I -- I think though with the airport security, it, um -- because, I mean, let's face it, you get on the plane, you don't -- if there's a terrorist on there, you don't have a choice.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, you know, like, you might as well say goodbye and -- and not -- whereas if you were on the ground, maybe you would have a chance.  Probably not much of one, but you would have more of a chance. 
L:  I think the people who were, ah, who were in, ah, the World Trade Center would tend to disagree with you. 
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, yes, that's true. [LAUGH] 
L:  The people --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- who perished would tend to disagree.
R:  Yes, that -- that is absolutely true.  But I -- I don't know --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- it just, you know, it -- it's a really big, deep topic, like, on --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, what do you do type thing in certain instances and, yeah --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know.  What can you do?  You can't do a lot of things. 
L:  No.
R:  Unfortunately. 
L:  Absolutely not. 
R:  No.
L:  I -- but, I -- I just think that, like, I don't know if I necessarily like the way they -- airport security, like, angers me so much, because I know I used to, like, sometimes I u- -- like, have really colored hair, you know, and, like, I used to have facial piercings --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and when I would dress more wacky, I would --
R:  You would get [inaudible]. 
L:  -- get stopped five or ten times, same --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- person, like, you know --
R:  Yeah, because you must be a bad person --
L:  Clearly.
R:  -- because you have colored hair and -- and you have facial --
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  -- piercings.  I mean, you know, like, and I mean, that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.  
L:  I'm at a fair -- I'm at, like, one of the top universities in the country, but it didn't matter, I -- I clearly wanna kill people because I dye my hair and choose to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- put, like, metal --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- through my skin. 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, right. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  No, but that -- I agree that's how a lot of people think.
L:  But on the -- the opposing side, on, like, the other hand, like, this is very -- interestingly, like, I would -- same person probably a week later wearing, like, a ble- black turtle neck and jeans doesn't get stopped once.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  And if that's how they're -- they're ter- -- they're expediting airport security, I don't know what they're achieving. 
R:  No, that's true.  I mean, it's -- it's not doing the job it should be doing obviously, if they're just targeting certain people.  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a friend of mine years and years ago was being watched at an airport, and they -- he knew it was a cop --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, ah, finally the cop sat down, and he's trying to make --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- talk with him, and -- and the guy said to him like, "You know, if -- if you're looking for me, that I'm carrying something, forget it.  You should be looking at the guy with the -- in the suit, the one --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- that's not conspicuous".  You know --
L:  Because, like, honestly, if you were going to kill a bunch of people, would you, like, would you be posting a sign on your forehead that said, "I have -- I have several weapons"?  Like --
R:  [LAUGH] No.
L:  "I'm dress- -- I'm dressed so you will check me out.  Look, I stand out of the crowd".
R:  Mhm, mhm, oh, I know.
L:  Right, that's absolutely ridiculous.  I'm angry.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  Yeah, no, I mean that, it is ridiculous, because, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, like, they're -- they're certainly not going to make themselves conspicuous --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- if they're, ah, [LAUGH] you know [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if they've got something --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- that they shouldn't be taking on the plane, you know, or they're going to do something once they get on the plane.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I mean --
R:  Yeah, it just, ah -- but then, not everybody thinks that way.  Um --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- they, you know, like, I mean, but I think a lot of the problem is that the security is not properly trained.  They had to bring it in so quickly --
L:  Well, that and, I mean, the people that are -- are --
