L:  [NOISE] My name is Sharm --
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.  Hi, I'm Sharma Getty.
R:  [MN] [SIGH] Okay.  Where do you live? [NOISE] 
L:  What's your name? [LAUGH]
R:  Ruth.
L:  Hi Ruth.  I live in Georgia.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm in +Missouri. [LAUGH] 
L:  Missouri?
R:  Long way's away.  Yes.
L:  Yes.  Okay.
R:  I've never been to Georgia.
L:  It's a nice place to be.
R:  Well, that's good.
L:  Okay.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  So what do we do next?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, how do you feel about [MN] athletic strikes? [NOISE] [SIGH] 
L:  The strikes or -- or I thought we talk about the salaries they receive.
R:  Okay.
L:  I thought it was salaries, I think.  As far as athl- -- athletic strikes [LIPSMACK] -- I mean, if they --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- if they're striking for pay caps or something, I think they make enough money.  There's no need for them to strike.  If they -- if they're striking for unions and mistreatment and stuff like that, I understand, but if they striking for more money, gosh, they make --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- more than they can spend. [LAUGH]
R:  Right. [NOISE] Um, [NOISE] you know the prices of tickets to the ballgames and -- and, ah, all that is getting so high that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know a family of four or six or however many kids they've got, you know -- well, I think a lot of people can't afford to go.
L:  Exactly.  I mean -- 
R:  You have to drive into the cities you know, to go to the ballgames.
L:  You have to pay for a park and they have to pay for the food, which, you know [SIGH] --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- five dollars for a slice of pizza is ridiculous.  Um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- seven dollars for a hot dog.  What do you get?  Mustard and ketchup is ridiculous and then they want to argue or strike for pay increase or because their salaries don't meet their um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- their, um -- their goals -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- in life or cost of living, I think is very unfair.
R:  [NOISE] Yes.
L:  That is very unfair.
R:  Oh, I do too. [NOISE]
L:  Because it's the families and -- and the -- the mothers and daddies who take their children to feed them --
R:  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  -- and then, you know  it's an -- it's -- it's an American treat to go out to -- to a football game --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or baseball game, let the children have a good time.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But when they get hungry and you got to spend --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- seven dollars on a hot dog, I don't care how big it is because they can't eat --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the whole thing, it's ridiculous.
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] Yeah.  Well, a Pepsi you know -- what do they charge for a drink?  You know?
L:  I believe it's --
R:  A dollar and a half --
L:  -- three fifty.
R:  -- or --
L:  No?
R:  -- two dollars?
L:  Oh no.  I believe it's three fifty.
R:  Oh, that much?
L:  [NOISE] Yes, and if -- it's t- -- two dollars for a bottle of water.
R:  Well, you see, you know, I -- you can tell I haven't gone to -- I haven't gone to a professional game for --
L:  [SIGH] [MN] 
R:  -- oh my --
L:  Mm.  Well, I think the price is --
R:  -- forty years. [LAUGH] 
L:  Really?  Well, I think the prices are too high for a family an- -- or even a single person.  I mean, they make enough money.  The same thing with Disney, even though we're not talking about Disney.  But be appreciative that your field or your -- your -- your -- your um -- your game; baseball, football, basketball, has elevated to -- to the point that it's at because of your fans --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and don't take advantage of your fans by having everything cost so much from water to --
R:  Right.
L:  -- a hot dog, to a napkin.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You can't even get a napkin without somebody having an attitude.  So, you making all these millions of dollars -- I mean -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and a hot dog should be a dollar fifty.  [MN] Water should be -- well, yes, everybody wants water now so maybe it shouldn't be free, but [SIGH] three dollars for a bottle of water is ridiculous but -- bring your prices down --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and you'll get more people to your games.
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  That's how I feel about it.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, you know, people are making --
R:  [SIGH] Yeah I, uh 
L:  -- people are making millions and millions of dollars whether it's over a five year period or a ten year period --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I know you have your cost of living, you have your mansion, you have your building.  Oh I un- -- I understand all that but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- don't take it out on the fans who got you where you are. [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] Well, nobody's worth that amount of money, you know.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they don't have to live in a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- mansion either. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, you know what, I have to admit --
R:  They -- they can live like the common person. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, I have to admit if -- if -- if -- if I was a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- top basketball player or football player or baseball, more than likely I would have a mansion too and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- hopefully I'll be sympathetic to my fans and um my head won't -- won't get -fused.  Now, I understand that that's how it is but [SIGH] you have to understand, you are where you are because of your fan base, and you should never --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- step on -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- on -- on their-- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- backs to elevate your position in life.
R:  Oh that's right.
L:  Because if -- because if -- if -- if -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if the -- if the tickets go up too high, they're not going to come.  And I know they say, "If you build it they -- they will come".  If the game is good they gonna come and they will spend whatever the money might be, but that's not true, 'cause you are an example -- you said you haven't been to a game for forty something odd years.  So there's -- there are a lot --"
R:  [SIGH] That's right.
L:  -- of people out there who won't come.
R:  Well, you know.  I live out in the rural area you know.  We're um --
L:  [MN] Okay.  But if you are a fan you will find a way.
R:  -- we're a [COUGH] a three hour drive from [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- Saint Louis and a three hour drive to --
L:  [NOISE] But if you are a fan --
R:  -- Kansas City, you know, [NOISE] to see the professional --
L:  -- and -- an- -- and for those who are fans, no matter what the cost is, they will find a way.  But there are many people who are fans and can't afford it.
R:  Yes.  I know.
L:  And -- an- you might -- and you might be able to afford getting in, but then if you have a family of two or three -- I have one child, but if you have -- if you have a family of two or three, well you might be able to get in [SIGH] but then you can't feed them.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And you can't come -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in with your own sandwiches and potato chips and all.
R:  Right. [NOISE] 
L:  So that also hinders people from coming because you can't afford to have a good time with your children.  And that's the bottom line.
R:  Right.
L:  True?
R:  Yeah.  I -- I think the salaries are just [NOISE] um -- just entirely too high.
L:  I think they're too high and well 
R:  And, um 
L:  [SIGH] Well, but you know what?  And it -- it also depends on the sport because even though they're um making a lot of money, they are abused [NOISE] as far as you know, th- the violence, because you know, it hurts -- the balls --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and all that good stuff and -- and they're -- they're practicing so hard.  I understand but just -- just like the young kid who's just got out of high school.  He's making ninety mi- -- he got a ninety million --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- N- Nike contract.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  That's ridiculous.
R:  Oh [NOISE] wasn't -- that's ridiculous.  I [MN] you know 
L:  Ninety million dollars to -- to endorse Nike.  Which, you know, I like Nike but, goodness gracious.
R:  This -- this eighteen year old kid, you know -- I mean --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- he should start out small bu- -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like one million you know. [LAUGH] 
L:  Let him appreciate it, [LAUGH] you know.  Life is hard.  You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Adversity -- adversity brings along appreciation.  [NOISE] Um 
R:  [SIGH] Uh-huh.
L:  -- and -- and how -- [MN] you know life is hard.  But don't let -- things should be [several inaudible words] about ninety million dollars for over a ten year period.  I don't care whether it's over a twenty period.  That's a lot of money. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] It is for a -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for a young person like that.  He has --
L:  Mm yes. 
R:  -- no idea --
L:  [NOISE] Exactly.
R:  -- how to manage money --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] [MN] 
R:  -- you know.  And um 
L:  I know my husband's in the bathroom listening to me. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  He's in the bathroom listening, but go on.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh.
L:  That's -- that's my feeling on salary caps or striking because your salary demands are not met, because, if this is your profession and if this is what you go into, you know, the pros and cons -- the same thing.  I'm a legal secretary and my -- my salary, which is nowhere near a lot of money -- but if this is the profession that you choose in the hopes of making money, there are pros and cons and because -- I work for a lawyer -- most lawyers are -- are mean.  That's part of the job.  Broken bones, oh this is part of the job.  Now, they should be compensated to a certain point, but they shouldn't be compensated to the point that the fans suffer because they can't come to the American dream with their families and enjoy a game.
R:  [NOISE] Yes.
L:  That's my stance.
R:  I -- yeah.  Yeah.  It's just um [LIPSMACK] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It -- it doesn't seem like there's any end to the [MN] -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- end in sight, you know --
L:  [NOISE] No, I mean -- 
R:  -- of how it's gonna be. [NOISE] 
L:  -- each year, I mean, you know with the -- with the drafts -- um, what is it called?  [LAUGH] The play -- not the play offs.  The -- the draft pick, which I love to watch.  But, "I understand you are good at your trade, but these astronomical figures are huge" and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they making money hand over fist.  They can't even spend all this money.  [SIGH] I don't care if you bought three mansions.  
R:  Right.
L:  You can buy all the Rolls Royces and Bentleys and all, but st- instead of being materialistic [LIPSMACK] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- just live life.  Enjoy.  You can have your mansion.  You -- you can have your Rolls Royce or your Bentley, you know.  Travel all over the world.  But, if your fans don't come, there's no game.
R:  Right.
L:  Who're you going to play for, the clouds?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I mean, you want your fans.  That's what hypes you up.  That's what gets the game going.  So, you -- you need your fans there [LIPSMACK] to push your adrenalin up.  But if -- if [MN] they have all this money, but if we can't afford to get into the gate, who're you gonna to play for?  That's the bottom line.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's 
L:  That's what I feel about it. [NOISE] 
R:  That's right.
L:  I went to a game a couple of weeks ago but I -- I got in free because of my boss but I bought --
R:  Oh, really? [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah, I mean, my boss has -- 
R:  Oh, you --
L:  -- season tickets but -- and -- and the season tickets --
R:  -- do you live in Atlanta?
L:  Yeah.  I live -- I live in, um [NOISE] in Atlanta [SIGH] --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- and my boss got [several inaudible word] I work for a lawyer so  even the -- the corporate tickets were like fourteen hundred dollars.  But -- 
R:  [SIGH] Well, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I said I hadn't been to a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- game for a long time, but I guess 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- actually about three or four years ago I was -- I went to my daughter's in Minne- -- Minneapolis --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and the day I got there she came home from work and she had four t- -- free tickets --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to the um Timber Wolves --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- basketball game that night --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] and so I got -- th- -- that's the first professional basketball game I'd ev- -- I've ever seen.
L:  And did you have a good time?
R:  [NOISE] Oh yeah.  Yeah, it was fun --
L:  And would -- how much money --
R:  -- you know, this dirig- -- dirigible flew over and they dropped ah --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- coupons and stuff out for people, you know --
L:  Fine, but how money did you spend?  On food --
R:  Well, we didn't spend anything.
L:  Okay.
R:  Well, we --
L:  You -- you didn't eat anything?
R:  -- you know we eat supper before we went.
L:  Okay, well this --
R:  No, I don't -- I don't remember eating anything.
L:  Okay.
R:  I think we just, you know, went a- --
L:  Well, that's fine, but you know but then it --
R:  -- [inaudible]
L:  -- it depends on [SIGH] -- on the time of the day.  See the point is, for those who have one child like me, it's easy. [NOISE] For those who have two, three children, it's difficult and you can't always eat before the game, depending on the time.
R:  Right.
L:  And with traffic and all --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and even though it would be wise to eat before the game you're not always privileged to eat before the game.  And you know wha- --
