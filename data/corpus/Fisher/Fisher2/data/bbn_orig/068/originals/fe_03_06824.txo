L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  Th- [MN] my name's Margaret.
R:  Hi.  I'm Margie.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, um what is your [NOISE] opinion on the -- today's topic? [NOISE] 
R:  I think they're way over paid. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh yeah, definitely. [NOISE] 
R:  Absolutely.
L:  That -- [NOISE] 
R:  I mean --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I mean, they're up there with the singers. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] The singers and the sports players and people who have no talent whatsoever. [LAUGH] 
R:  The rap singers. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] Well.  I don't know [SIGH] but um. [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] But ah, going on strike.  I'm not even sure what they were going on strike for.
R:  I know.
L:  And I keep thinking about the baseball strikes from a few years ago --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- when th- -- the [SIGH] ball players were crying about, "I only make seven million dollars a year". 
R:  I know, it's so ridiculous.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] [NOISE] So, um  [NOISE] 
R:  And you know just, you know, having a family and wanting to take my children to a sporting event --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- that I can't even afford [SIGH] just for -- the tickets alone are ridiculous.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I've seen -- I've um -- I'm -- I'm near a -- an arena or sports --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- stadium and I've seen the parking prices --
R:  It's ridiculous.
L:  -- that they charge for -- it's always a whole lot more for the Vikings game than for anything else.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH] And --
R:  And then they want to charge us six -- six dollars for a hot dog and a soda.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Oh yeah.  Even inside.
L:  I haven't been to a game in --
R:  -- it's ridiculous.
L:  -- thirty or forty years.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  Yeah.  And ah --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- boy I -- I'd stay home and watch it on TV --
R:  I know.
L:  -- if they even run it on TV.  Do they do that any -- I mean?
R:  Yes, they do.
L:  [NOISE] 'Cause --
R:  They do.
L:  -- some of these --
R:  But, um, if they're playing at home it's usually on cable.
L:  Ahah.
R:  Or HBO.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know like -- I know with the Flyers 
L:  [NOISE] Huh.  Yeah.  Well, the -- I think the whole [NOISE] [SIGH] ah, so called entertainment field is extremely over paid.
R:  Right.  Over paid and over rated.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Very much over rated.  I've -- I prefer old movies --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I think that they [SIGH] um -- things have deteriorated since the sixties considerably.
R:  Yes.
L:  They just -- [MN] um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- there's no magic left to it really.  [SIGH] So 
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH] I don't think what they're -- a lot of them -- what they're doing I don't even call acting [NOISE] because it's so bad --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- or vi- -- you know, it's just, "They're taking the clothes off". 
R:  Right
L:  Big deal.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] It's ridiculous.
L:  Yeah.  And for twenty million dollars --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- a year for a picture?
R:  Right. [NOISE] 
L:  That's absurd.
R:  You're absolutely right.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Um. [SIGH] Um [SIGH] I'm -- yeah --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I wish I knew more about what --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they were --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- striking about.  [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] It -- to at least have some --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- idea of what their so called --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- complaints are.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  I don't -- I don't get it either.
L:  Yeah, I can understand when it's a writers' strike because they've always been poorly paid and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [MN] given -- given the shaft.
R:  Yep. 
L:  But --
R:  Them and the teachers.  I think schoolteachers too.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Oh, yeah the school teachers and --
R:  Seems like they go on strike a lot too. [NOISE] 
L:  -- the people who really help keep society going.
R:  Right.
L:  Oh man.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  It's just so awful.
R:  I know.
L:  I mean -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- oh well anyway.  [LAUGH] [SIGH] Oh, I guess we've covered that topic. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes.  [LAUGH] Um, how long have you been doing this study?
L:  [SIGH] This?  Oh just a few -- like a week or so --
R:  Oh okay.
L:  -- this is my third call.
R:  Oh okay.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  This is my second.
L:  Yeah, so I guess --
R:  Now, do you call in or do they find you?
L:  [SIGH] I called them.  There was an ad in the Want Ads --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I figured --
R:  But I mean like when I connected tonight.  Someone found you?
L:  Oh, I called tonight.  They had left a message on my machine.  I was gone for work --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I figure, "Well, what the heck.  Let's see what the subject is".
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Um, um.  I'd love to see --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the, um -- the [MN] results of this study.
R:  Yes.  Will they ever show us the results?
L:  I have no idea.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.  So I guess I -- I think I probably will --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- call them up and ask what happens now and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- whether 
R:  And I guess they do people from all different areas and all.  Like what area do you live in?
L:  I'm in Minnesota --
R:  Okay, and --
L:  -- so in the mid-west.
R:  -- I'm right outside of Philadelphia.
L:  Philadelphia.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I think that someone else I talked to was in the Pennsylvania area --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but she sounded -- she had uh, a very different accent.
R:  Oh okay.
L:  She was -- sounded more um, some other region anyway.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Southern maybe.
R:  Right.
L:  But  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] Yeah.  But the um -- I don't know, there's not much -- I've -- there's nothing much to say about this --
R:  No because we both agree --
L:  -- this subject.
R:  -- that [LAUGH] they're definitely over rated and over paid and they should never go on strike. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  And I -- I'd be curious to know [MN] hear -- like hear what somebody else's opinion.  Somebody who thinks that they are paid --
R:  Right.
L:  -- fairly.  Huh.  I'd like to hear what their story is. [NOISE] 
R:  I know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Stay in your booth. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.  'Cause ah --
R:  [LIPSMACK] But I don't think they ever do --
L:  -- I don't know how you can justify it.
R:  -- the same topic twice. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH] I don't know how you can justify it. [NOISE] [SIGH] So, [SIGH] um [LAUGH] the um -- so have -- what other areas have you reached with your -- well, this is your second call.  What was your first call like?  Hello?  You still there?  Oh, did we get cut off?  [PAUSE] What happened?  [NOISE] Hello?  [PAUSE] Wow. [PAUSE] We aren't doing what we're supposed to I guess.  [PAUSE] Oh. [PAUSE] Oh shoot. [NOISE] [PAUSE]
