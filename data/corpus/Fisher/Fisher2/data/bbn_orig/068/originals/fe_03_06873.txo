R:  Hi, this is Alana.
L:  Hi, my name's Anne.
R:  Hi Anne, how are you?
L:  Good.  How are you?  Did you say Elena?
R:  Alana.
L:  Alana.  Oh, that's pretty. [LAUGH] 
R:  Thank you.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, airport security we're supposed to talk about, I guess.
L:  Yeah, I know a whole lot about that.  Do you fly very often?
R:  No, I don't, I -- in fact I haven't flown since before nine eleven.
L:  No, me either. [LAUGH]
R:  So, I don't know, ah, what, you know, I haven't personally experienced the -- the changes that -- that have occurred as a result of nine eleven.
L:  Yeah, I haven't either.  Right, with all the taking off your shoes and [LAUGH] ah, all the checks and stuff.  I guess just what I see is from what they report on the news.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, so sometimes it sounds like they've beefed it up, but then sometimes it sounds like things have kind of slid a little bit.
R:  Right, well, I -- I guess, um I -- I wonder if the beefed up airport security will prevent, or help prevent similar incidences from occurring again.
L:  I think it can help.  I think sometimes a terrorist might, ah, choose something different to do if they think that we're already watching the airports, maybe we're not watching the trains or the boats or the arenas, or something like that.
R:  Yes.  You know, I -- I traveled on the train this -- this weekend and -- and I -- I thought of that, because I know years ago, there was terrorism in Peru against -- against the train --
L:  Oh.  Oh wow.
R:  -- you know. [LAUGH] 
L:  That'd be a little scary.
R:  So I, you know, that -- that thought had occurred to me that --
L:  Now, did they have a lot of security, ah, on the train?
R:  No.
L:  Getting on to the train, or anything?
R:  No, none -- none -- none at all really.
L:  Yeah, see that's what I was thinking, I'm thinking, well we're all so cautious and careful at the airports and we're all focusing on that, then they can sneak around and find some other way --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- um, to attack, you know.
R:  I know.
L:  So [LAUGH] are you -- do you li- -- what part of the country do you live in?
R:  I live in, um, Agawam[?], Massachusetts.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm in Chicago.
R:  Chicago, huh?
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, so um, I get a little concerned about the terrorist thing. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  My kids go to school downtown and, ah, so when nine eleven happened, of course I went downtown to go get my kids because there were still planes in the air, and um, Sear's Tower is like, four blocks from where they go to school.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, so, I thought, I don't want to take any chances.  I'm gonna take them out today. [LAUGH] But they had no idea what was going on, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, you know, they're -- my six year old was a little bit concerned but, ah, and she doesn't want to fly. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  None of my kids want to fly, so, um, you know, I don't know, I just think, ah, you know, you see these reports, although sometimes I kind of get mad at the media.  I think sometimes they give ideas away [LAUGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, they'll talk about, you know, how people hid this or that, and you know, one way or another, or they use a certain type of materials to hide in their luggage and it didn't pass under the metal detectors, or, you know, they give different -- [LAUGH] they say what's slipping by so then if you're watching TV --
R:  People get ideas, yeah.
L:  -- yeah, they're watching TV and they're terrorists and they go, "Oh yeah, I didn't think of that". [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Of course, they can find out just about anything on the internet, I suppose.
L:  That's [LAUGH] true.
R:  You know, if they want to know what slips through the -- the -- the airports, I'm sure there's some way to find out on the internet.
L:  That's true.  Yeah.
R:  You know, after all, that's how I found this study.
L:  Oh, yeah, really?
R:  Through an email.
L:  Oh you're kidding.
R:  I got an email. I -- I do mystery shopping -- 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- an- -- and I got an email from one of the companies that schedules the shop --
L:  Oh.  Yeah, because a friend of mine does mystery shopping so that's how I found out about it, it was through her --
R:  So --
L:  -- so um, it's like, oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But that's true, you can find a lot out through email. [LAUGH] 
R:  I know.  If the terrorists want to find something, I'm sure they can just surf the net and find it.
L:  Yeah, that is true.  I guess if you really know what you're looking for, too.
R:  I mean, the information has always been available but it used to be you'd have to go dig through books in the library and --
L:  Right, and it takes time.  You gotta leave your house. [LAUGH] 
R:  It's a little bit more work.
L:  It sure is.
R:  But now, oh my gosh.
L:  I know.  Well sometimes I think the thing that, you know, it's like you can even get lists of people's, ah, names and their past or records about them, and you know, I think they can even find stuff like that where they're hired people, um, and airports that have not passed security clearances or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- things like that, and they find where the link -- weakest link is and ah, and that's the way they can get through. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  But I'm thinking, you know, I -- I have a toenail clipper in -- in my purse [LAUGH] and if they search my purse [LAUGH] you know, would -- would they arrest me because I have something like that in my purse, and would somebody really be able to attack somebody with a toenail clipper, you know?
R:  Oh, I don't know. [LAUGH] 
L:  But I know, I -- I even went to Oprah one time, Oprah, um, show and they -- they take everything out of your purse, um, you know, and if it's anything that could be a weapon or anything you can talk on, they take it away from you. [LAUGH]
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Going into the show, huh?
L:  Going into the show, yeah.
R:  Wow.
L:  And then you get -- you get a little ticket and you get it back when you leave.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But ah, they don't even let you bring in reading material.
R:  Oh.
L:  I had -- I had a magazine in my purse, and, ah, I carry a big purse [LAUGH] and a cell phone and they took that away.
R:  Wow.
L:  And, um, I'm like, wow, they re- -- they have higher security on Oprah than they do at the airport. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, really.  I don't think they take your magazine away from you at the airport.
L:  I don't think so either, [LAUGH] or your cell phone, they might tell you not to turn it on at certain times, but you know, it was very high security.  I thought, why don't we just send the Oprah studio over to the airport --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Really.
L:  [LAUGH] And they could do some security there, [LAUGH] you know.  I guess she's afraid that, you know, on TV you'll be reading the magazine or something and not looking like you're interested --
R:  Interested, yeah.
L:  -- in the show, so [LAUGH] I don't know. [LAUGH] But, I don't know.  I -- I think with the airport thing, I have no idea because I don't fly that often so --
R:  Yeah.  I -- I haven't flown, um, for about, I don't know, I guess it's been about three years.
L:  Oh well, you're better than me.
R:  Once in a while -- well I have -- I -- I flew to China to get my daughter.
L:  Wow!  Oh wow.  How neat.
R:  That was in -- in nineteen ninety eight --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- before -- before nine eleven, you know --
L:  Right.  That's cool.
R:  Um, yeah, it was -- it was cool. [LAUGH] 
L:  How old was she when you got her?
R:  Twenty months.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh precious.  We have some friends who adopted a little girl from China, too, and ah, it's really cool, you know, it's neat that you're able to do that.  I hear right now it's kind of closed because of the SARS, um, thing.
R:  Yes.  Did your friends adopt recently?  Did they have to go through the airport security stuff?
L:  No, they adopted -- no, they adopted her, let's see, she's three, so, pretty much when she was a baby, so about three years ago.
R:  Oh, so before nine eleven, huh?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, so they got in before then too, so it's, like, oh, but now you hear all this, you know, besides health security and nine eleven security and you know, I hear there's a lot of people wanting to adopt from China but they can't because of the SARS epidemic --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and um, I can imagine how frustrated -- I mean, can you imagine you waiting for your twenty month old and they suddenly tell you you can't?
R:  Oh, I know, because --
L:  You know --
R:  -- some -- I -- I'm -- I'm a single adoptive mommy --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- but some people have gone, are couples, and they've gone through the whole thing of um, you know, trying to have their own baby and oh 
L:  Yes, right.  It's horrible, yeah 'cause I had some other friends who, ah, went through the whole trying to have a baby thing and trying to adopt an American baby and they really had trouble, and every time they'd get one it'd get taken away for some reason or another, distant relatives and stuff.
R:  That's why I didn't adopt here.
L:  Yeah.  They actually adopted one from Romania.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, ah --
R:  We're -- we're -- we're getting off the topic here, I think. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yes, I know. [LAUGH] They flew a plane to Romania. [LAUGH] 
R:  They -- they did, huh?
L:  [LAUGH] And they were there for a long time, but that again, was a long time ago and airport security, of course, was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- very minimal there.
R:  Right, right, yeah, I -- I -- I mean, it used to be you just went through the metal -- metal detector, or you had --
L:  Yeah, I only ever pick people up, like, if someone's coming into the airport, I'll just have them meet me by the baggage check or by the front door --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so I don't have to go to the gate and go through all that security, you know, just to pick someone up.
R:  Well I guess they don't -- they don't let you go through the security to pick people up, any more.
L:  They don't?  See, I used to -- I used to go all the way to the gate to pick someone up --
R:  I know, I used to do that too, but I think they stopped it when that -- even before nine eleven.
L:  Oh really?  See it's been a long time since I have flown.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's probably been five or six years, so it's been a -- been a while.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But ah, yeah, I just remember, you know, flying through there and taking, like, my mom came when I had a baby, and you know, I took her through the O'Hare Airport to um, pick her up and drop her off.  My mother would have never come if there wasn't somebody to meet her right after she got off the door of the plane. [LAUGH] Because she just doesn't do anything without somebody guiding her.
R:  Yeah.  She sounds a little bit like my mother.
L:  Really? [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I'm thinking, if I have to tell my mom, "You gotta find your way [LAUGH] to the baggage check before I pi- --" she'd say, "I'm not coming."
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] She -- I was shocked she even actually came --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and actually took a plane, um, to come and -- and see me when I had a baby.  To come to Chicago.
R:  Wow.
L:  And she actually went to my sister who lived in Ohio at the time, so my sister had a baby a month before me so she flew to Ohio a month before and she flew to Chicago when I had -- I'm like, "Wow mom, I've never seen you travel so much." [LAUGH]
