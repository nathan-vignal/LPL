L:  My name is Sheila, hello.
R:  Hello, my name is Joe.
L:  Hi, Joe.
R:  How are you?
L:  How you doing? [LAUGH] Sorry about that.
R:  Good.  That's okay.  How are you?
L:  I'm doing fine, thank you.
R:  Good.
L:  I've had some rain today so --
R:  Oh yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what state do you live in?
L:  Minnesota.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm in New York.
L:  Okay.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, um, what was the question now, or the subject, it was do I think --
R:  Your feeling on airport security.
L:  Oh boy, [LIPSMACK] oh wow, I have no idea, um, how about you?
R:  Well, being that I live in New York and with nine eleven I think that there's always more we can do and there's further steps we can take.  I just think the federal government has to find the -- the funds, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the background checks that we do on the screeners -- uh, and I'm sure you've seen the paper, it's not enough.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We're -- we're still getting criminals there.  Um, since nine eleven they don't screen as often, they don't do the random luggage check as often so, uh, it's one of those things that it was a bad thing, it's been over a year, people start to forget about it and things become more lackadaisical --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it opens up new avenues for the terrorists.
L:  Yes, I'm -- I know what you mean about everyone's kinda like forgotten about it, especially out here where we weren't as affected by it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, we didn't have to, like, be afraid every time we heard an airplane going over which I hear they had a lot of airplanes going over just for -- patrolling the area after that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and [MN]. [LAUGH]
R:  Absolutely.  Well, even at the -- all the bridges and tunnels we had the National Guard set up and they were searching every car, every truck.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  And, you know, after four months you don't see that anymore.  So, I mean, if -- these people, we know they're patient, look at the amount of time there was between the first World Trade Center attack in the nineties --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then the second one --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- five, six, seven years.  But they're patient enough to wait us out 'cause they know that Americans are not patient people. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We like fast food, we like fast cars and we're gonna forget about things and we're -- and, you know, they look at us lazy rich Americans.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So after a certain amount of time they know that we'll be -- we're gonna become lackadaisical again --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and our security standards will drop.  And if they want to, god help them, they- they'll do it again.
L:  [LAUGH] No kidding.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I believe that and then, like you were saying with the funding too, that -- it's like, "Okay, you know, we have this homeland defence security plan out there" and, like, I've heard the [inaudible] people and everyone and they're saying, "Great, we've got these nice plans, we want us to, you know, put together something and have these extra alerts and extra security but where is the money for it?" [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  Well, a- an- and, you know, what's funny is that some colleges now actually have homeland security courses, you can take -- you can get a -- you can get a degree in homeland security.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, you know, some of these -- and it -- it the -- the whole problem with it is -- is that between the -- the research and technology that we have we spend all this money on the research and technology but we're -- we're always too scared to actually use it to protect the American people against terrorist attacks, you know.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  We don't secure our waterways, we don't secure our ports --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, um, the people at the Coastguard Academy who graduate, they should be the first ones that get, um, promoted into the Department of --
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- Homeland Security, they don't.
L:  You could -- [LAUGH] 'cause they have all that information that they've been taught and they've learned for doing and now, duh [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, ex- exactly.  Exactly.
L:  Wow.  And too bad they couldn't use like some of the money from the tuition to help fund --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, the laws and all that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- too, that'd be a nice way to do that.
R:  Yeah.  And then -- and they say, um, the reason that they wanna -- they wanna do this is they wanna take a -- a bipartisan approach, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for border policy discussions and -- and I -- I, you know, when they say, you know, given it's hard, given your poor but still it doesn't matter because they say eighteen hundred immigrants come into the country illegally a day.
L:  Wow.
R:  You know, five of the nine suspects in custody, um, were -- were living right within five miles of the World Trade Center.
L:  Wow.
R:  You know, so it's -- it's crazy.
L:  Uh, uh --
R:  But I -- I definitely think that they should be doing more at the airports and I -- I --
L:  And then the problem too comes in is then -- then you have, um, [LIPSMACK] like people are talking about, "Well, there go our constitutional rights and --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- rights of privacy" and -- and so how do you feel on that with, uh --
R:  Uh, I th -- I think if you are not an American -- American citizen the constitution shouldn't -- shouldn't affect you.  Because out of the nineteen -- uh, out of all the hijackers, nineteen of them violated their terms of their visa.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And almost every single one of them had incomplete or they were incorrect application forms.
L:  [MN] Oh wow.
R:  So, wh- why should they -- if they can't follow our rules, how come the constitution should protect them?  It shouldn't.
L:  No.
R:  They overstay -- the- they overstay their visas, they -- they come here as students, thirty three, thirty four year old students --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, it -- it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and we didn't do anything to stop it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, I think our immigrations policies are just as bad as our airport security policy.
L:  [LAUGH] Mhm.  I kinda of -- it -- it -- it's one of those things where we're so proud of, okay, you know, we've got this free country and we want people to experience it but at the same time we don't want to really police the people that come in here, is that kind of how you look at?
R:   Absolutely.  The first time we actually set immigration laws was, like, in eighteen nineteen and it was that all the ships that came into United States --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- had to provide a list of all the passengers they brought on their voyage.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, we now -- now we do that but now we give them the opportunity now once they get here to become -- become American citizens or to get a visa to go to school but there's nobody policing it.
L:  [MN] Mhm.
R:  So, I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, I -- I think it's more than just airport security.  I think giving out the visas, I think, you know, the immigration enforcement system, I think all that is part of the problem.
L:  Yeah, I would say there's definitely a disconnect somewhere because [MN] -- you know, and then where there weren't, you know, like, all these people it's like they said in some cases they had been, you know, kind of watching a couple of them or something like that and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they had some of the knowledge but then again with that disconnect somewhere, you know, it just kinda happened. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  An- and they have all this new biometric technology now that --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh yeah.
R:  -- that, um --
L:  Like scan your eye and then that lets you in, in that type.
R:  Exactly, an- and the two fingerprints, the digital photograph, the retinal scan, but it -- it all costs a lot of money and the federal government they have to decide if they wanna put the money to that or put it into unemployment, social security and welfare.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, you know, it -- it's a -- I think it's a catch twenty two and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I ju- I just think the thing we gotta do is we just have to stop being so lax at the airports, at -- you know, at the docks, at the ports --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, double check the travel documents, you know.
L:  Mhm. [LIPSMACK]
R:  And then once a photo and a fingerprint is taken the person should be checked against lists of those who should be detained for, you know, a reason, terrorists connections, criminal violations, past visa violations.
L:  Mhm.
R:  There should be a check -- you know, a -- a checklist.
L:  Mhm.  And then, like, too someone was talking with me at a gas station and they were saying, "Well, it's great that we go out and help the people over the se- overseas" you know, like the aids --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they're taking, what is it, six billion or whatever for --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the African aid and all that, you know, and he was saying, "Well, it's great but what about here, we've got people hurting here, we've got people that need medical care here, we've got people that need to be schooled so that ..." you know, people who have education behind, they're usually not the ones who are out there toting the guns and dealing drugs and, you know, and all that because they need to get money somewhere --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and --
R:  Absolutely, just --
L:  -- another catch twenty two [LAUGH].
R:  Well, it's just like the -- that Sally Struthers commercial, you know, she wants you to a- adopt a kid in -- in Taiwan for a dollar a day when I guarantee you there's a -- a kid in rural Kentucky who could -- you know, we could support --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in our own homeland for a dollar a day.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But we always -- you know, we're always trying to be the big brother to everybody and then --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- all -- and the other countries don't appreciate it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I really don't think they do.
L:  Well, some do but, of course, it's -- you don't hear about it too much either because there aren't probably very many people -- you know, it's more of a grass roots thing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the government doesn't give you the, "Well, that's great" and all that y- you have to actually get into the country and -- and, uh, you know, then you get the feedback --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- et cetera, just like people asking well why do people -- why do the other countries hate us and it's, like, there's plenty out there [LAUGH].
R:  Well, yeah, look at Congress.
L:  You know, there's plenty out there for them to hate us for, you know, because, I mean, look we're rich and all this and we're just kinda like lackadaisical, you know, and all that and, you know, there's plenty to [LAUGH] -- to hate us for.  I can see that myself, you know.
R:  Yeah, well I -- I th- I don't know but the -- the money part 'cause I know what -- this last month Congress appropriated, like, four hundred million dollars for this year alone to establish, you know, um ...
