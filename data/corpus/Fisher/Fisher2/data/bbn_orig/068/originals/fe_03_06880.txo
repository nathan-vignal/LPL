L:  Hi, I'm Julia.
R:  Hi, I'm Linda.
L:  What's your name?
R:  Linda.
L:  Oh, Linda.  Um, yeah, I think it does help, um, heightened security helps reduce risk of terrorism [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  I don't really know what to say.  But, um --
R:  Yeah, I do too.
L:  You do too?
R:  Uh, yeah.  I don't think it reduces -- I don't think it -- i- it has a -- it has an affect of course, you know, because we're getting a lot of the, um, [LIPSMACK] uh, a lot of weapons do -- you know, people still arri- you know, show up with weapons and stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Major stuff, you know, not just like kni- forks and --
L:  [LAUGH] Right, right, and paper cli- I mean, not paper clips but, uh, nail clippers. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I mean, it -- it is really interesting because they -- they've gotten really serious about it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, 'cause I remember I was travelling and I had -- I was travelling with salt and --
R:  With what?
L:  With salt, 'cause I cook --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, um, so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- sometimes I bring my own salt because, you know, 'cause I -- I don't know -- and anyways they, um, they had to do this whole thing about it and I ended up having to leaving it behind.
R:  Oh.
L:  Because they got -- because they -- they didn't know what it was and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they -- oh, I think -- or maybe, I think, they actually finally decided it was okay or I -- I don't know, I think I might have had to leave it alone because they -- my plane was leaving and I had to go [LAUGH].
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, um, I think that it helps.  I mean, I think definitely we showed that we had a lax security system, I guess, 'cause there was a lot of things that -- they showed a lot of loopholes with the terrorist attacks.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, but, um, so -- I mean, they say that there's I'm not sure what country it is but they definitely are very vigilant about their security and -- and the reason is is because they've had so many, you know, problems.
R:  Right, you --
L:  So ...
R:  -- don't remember what country that is?
L:  No, I can't remember offhand.
R:  Because w- for one thing I think [LIPSMACK] -- I don't know maybe the focus is -- it has helped definitely but I think the focus -- I mean, maybe they need more -- just to put more money into the mac- into the actual physical part of the machinery, you know, that's supposed to help this and the gates versus the peo- so much -- [LIPSMACK] versus just hiring a bunch of people.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, I -- in other words, I'm not ta- --
L:  You mean the stuff tha- that the people go through?
R:  Yeah, maybe they should spend more money, you know, like those little corny little things that they go -- you know, you know, you put your stuff on, well, I mean,  you know, maybe they might -- there should be something a little bit more secure to -- just that looks all the way through it --
L:  Yeah.  Well, I know that the stuff that they have is actually fairly secure 'cause I had a ton of things in one of my backpacks --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, I just had -- it was just -- I had -- because I think I pretty much put, like, everything and I w- I felt really stupid but I actually had a little pair of, um, child -- child scis- scissors --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, those little tiny ones? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they knew it was in there and I was like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I completely forgot, I'm like, "Oh my god, that was so stupid" you know.
R:  Well, what'd you put 'em in there for? [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, because -- I mean, 'cause it some- I -- I use 'em all the time.
R:  Oh.
L:  And when I go travelling, you know -- or not when I got travelling but I use 'em all -- like cut out cards and stuff and -- and -- and --
R:  Oh okay.
L:  -- make postcards and things.  Yeah.  So, I was -- you know, when I was packing that's all I was thinking about and like for some reason it was really stupid to do that and they saw them in there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I was -- I was actually amazed that they -- you know, that they -- they're, like -- they didn't know what it was but they knew there was something sharp in there.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I was like, "Oh my gosh" you know.
R:  Yeah.  I --
L:  But, um, yeah, I mean, I guess I can see, you know, from -- on -- on some perspective, you know, it's like they -- they do have some pretty good, um, you know, security, you know, but I -- I definitely think, um -- I don't know, I mean, yeah they have to pay attention, yeah they have to try and do whatever they can and -- and -- and the scrutiny that they've been under that, you know, that -- there really wasn't, um, that much -- I mean, pretty much anything --
R:  No, there wasn't.
L:  -- could get through the security people.  
R:  Yeah, there wasn't anything really going --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- on before it's --
L:  Yeah, and, I mean, you know, it was really pretty much like, um -- I mean, an in- an interesting thing is that, um, is where I work is, um, we -- we have to ask for credit -- um, ID on all credit cards and a lot of people [NOISE] actually had a problem with that when they're, you know, purchasing stuff and, um -- but what's really interesting is -- it was -- I've started to realise how many people come in with their mother or so and so's credit card, you know, and they just charge things on there.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  And it seems -- and it -- and it seems like people have gotten really into their own habit of doing, um --
R:  And people don't really --
L:  -- what they're gonna do --
R:  -- know, huh?
L:  Yeah, and someone just gives 'em their credit card and says, "Yeah, go ahead and use it" and it really is like no one ever looks at the credit card.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, and -- and things that -- where I work they do.  And so it's really interesting, um, to kinda see how, like, there is a lot of lax, you know, um, procedures in a lot of different ways and, um, until --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- something happens, like, then the people start to say, "Well, maybe we should be a little bit more vigilant about it".
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, you know, so least they're -- they're putting more training in and they're actually saying, "Yeah, maybe we should pay attention" because, I don't know, like, after what happened in September eleven if you didn't do anything we'd be really, really stupid.  You know, it's like, "Oh" --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I think it's different states too have -- just like, you know, people know some states are, you know, well known for certain type of crimes, that it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- easy to commit, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, um, I'm in Washington State --
L:  Uh-huh, so am I.
R:  -- and -- uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And well just for instance, you know, it's like one of the best place for homeless people.
L:  Oh.
R:  Because of, um -- because we're -- you know, we're just not like LA, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that has its big vigilant police thing and people are -- you know what I'm saying?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  We're like really lax, uh, easy -- you know, easy going.
L:  Okay, I see what you're saying.
R:  So, um, I -- I'm thinking maybe in New Jersey whatev- -- wasn't that New Jersey where most of the stuff happened?  The, um, flights.
L:  Um, it was out of Boston.
R:  The security -- yeah, Boston.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm thinking something had to been going on there where it was so, you know, lax too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Even though all across the country it was like that but --
L:  Yeah, pretty much, I think, it was lax everywhere and they just knew where our loopholes were.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, like, I mean, no one was gonna stop you if you have a box cutter.  I mean, no one was gonna stop you.
R:  Right.
L:  And now it's like -- people are like -- that's what they go on with.  They got on with that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- little bit of a thing and -- and I guess now that's why they're like, "Okay --"
R:  But --
L:  "-- nobody can bring [LAUGH] anything sharp on".
R:  Yeah, but think about it wou- would you think -- I wouldn't want anybody on with a box cutter, would you have?
L:  But, you know, it -- there --
R:  I mean, what do you need one for?
L:  -- was never a law against it.  I mean, I'm sure that people, you know, carry those -- I mean, like, you know, they'll carry those type of things with them and they're not thinking of 'em --
R:  But if you're at work --
L:  -- as a weapon, they're thinking of 'em that they use 'em -- people who go hiking and backpacking or whatever, it's, like, just part of their whole thing, you know.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  And maybe it might just happen to be in their backpack or -- I don't know.
R:  Mm mm, mm mm.
L:  Yeah, you know what I mean and there was never any -- well, the only thing is is that it wasn't completely traceable either, I don't know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I have -- I have no idea how they got 'em on there.  I don't know if they -- I mean, I always thought they snuck 'em in somehow.
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they probably did.  I mean, I don't know if they snuck 'em in or if it was just one of those things where it wouldn't be, like, not allowed, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  But, um -- but yeah I think that -- yeah, I mean, I think they have tried to improve, I mean, [SIGH] yeah it actually makes me thing I don't know if -- if they just snuck those in or if they, um, of if it wasn't something -- if some -- if -- if he had a box cutter and no one would ma- even raise an eyebrow about it before, I don't know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But --
R:  Uh, they told us but I don't remember what --
L:  Yeah, I don't remember [LAUGH] either.
R:  -- the deal is.
L:  And, I mean, it is interesting I- it's like, you know, it's like -- it's kinda  hassle when you're just an average person that just wants to go on -- fly across the country and that's all you really care about.  You know, and there's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- all these other people who just have all these other motives and then [LAUGH] -- and, you know, and so if you do have fingernail clippers all of a sudden you're like, "Oh, I can't those, shoot" you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They have to be in my suitcase or -- but, um, so I don't know it's -- I definitely feel like, yeah, I mean, you have to [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- you have to do something.
R:  Yeah, on my last flight when I came they -- the thing went off on my shoes a- and, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, you know, it was just a -- kind of a routine thing.  I know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's what you have to do and I know if I'm not guilty of anything I don't have any problem with it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, and you just do what you gotta do.  You have to show up an hour or two early or in --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- you know, and --
L:  -- definitely.
R:  -- mind your Ps and Qs and --
L:  Yeah, I think --
R:  -- you'll be okay.
L:  What?
R:  And you'll be okay --
L:  Well, yeah.
R:  -- it's the people, you know, that --
L:  I think we all think about it, we all realize why.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, I guess what would be interesting is because I don't think anybody ever would conceive of what had happened it was just -- I mean, it just was so shocking that it's like, "Oh wow" you know, and so now when they say we're gonna enforce security measures, we're like, "Yeah, I can understand why".
R:  Right.
L:  But before that we've been like, "What the hell's your problem?" [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, if you think about it they -- that was really -- I mean --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- using little box cutters to do all that was really something.
L:  Oh yeah, it was -- yeah.
R:  I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know --
L:  It -- yeah.
R:  -- what if they'd have had some -- you know, the -- some other stuff --
L:  It was just very sophisticated, it really was.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, it was pretty amazing and I think that really just shook us up to the degree that, it's like when they started saying, "We need enforced security measures" we're like, "Yeah, exactly" [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We're like, "Yeah, we agree". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...  But, um, yeah, so I guess I do -- I -- I -- I do agree.  I think they should.  I don't know what else is there about [LAUGH] in.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  I don't know it is -- it is hard to, you know, to deal with the hassle and stuff, it is hard but -- yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.
