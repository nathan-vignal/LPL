R:  Hi, I'm Candice.
L:  Hi, I'm Bambi.  How are you?
R:  Good.  How are you?
L:  Good. [LAUGH] 
R:  This is an interesting topic. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  It's a -- it's a tough one.
R:  Very difficult.
L:  Yeah.  Do you know a lot about the situation?
R:  I know a modest amount.  How about you?
L:  You what?  I'm sorry.
R:  I know a modest amount.  How about you?
L:  Yeah, I -- I -- I know a little bit, um, I -- I just feel that there's like, you know, ten thousand years of history that there's no way I can ever catch up on. [LAUGH] 
R:  That's kind of how I feel as well. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  So do you think there will ever be peace there?
R:  I don't think as long as there's any kind of outside influence there will ever be peace.  I think that there's so much hatred and blood spilt between the two completely different cultures at this point --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that it would almost be better if we just left them alone to work it out themselves --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and if it ends up in war, it ends up in war, but I -- I don't think that people enforcing a peace from the outside ever really accomplishes anything.
L:  Right.
R:  What do you think?
L:  Yeah, I -- I think it's really difficult.  I mean, it's kind of like, you know, if there's two kids fighting and they really hate each other, um, you know, is -- is somebody going to be able to inspire them to sit down and talk --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- or should they just let the kids slug it out?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  You can't make people like each other.
L:  Right.  I mean, I feel that you -- you definitely can't force them and I think at the moment there's -- there's way too much interference going on where people are just trying to boss everybody around and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, especially the US is, like, I don't know, they -- they're behaving like they're the parent and the others are kids.
R:  Yeah.  And you can't really do that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it doesn't really work.  There was actually a study done where they took, like, Israeli and Palestinian teenagers --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and they bought them -- bought them to the US and put them in a camp and they didn't -- um, like, they actually got them to talk about it and they became friends and everything, and the idea was --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- that you train them one by one to become friends and realize that they're human --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and so when they go back they won't join the army and try to kill each other and there won't be so much hatred.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess, like, it was great while they were in the US and then they went back and um, they followed up with it, like, I think five years later to see if it made any affect --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and like, two of them had been killed and, like, one of them was in the army and another --
L:  Yikes.
R:  -- one was involved with terrorism.  Each one of them had someone who was killed.  So from the time that they came to the US to the time that they came back --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- there was so much hatred built up in just that five year period from, you know, just, you know, going out to eat and seeing somebody get hurt or having a relative go shopping and not come back --
L:  Right.  That's horrible.
R:  Yeah.  It just -- I -- I think especially from countries that don't live with that day to day reality, you don't understand the fear and hatred that builds up.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I find it really hard also to pass judgment because, like -- like you say, I mean -- I've never experienced it.  I've never been there --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and um, you know, I lived in Europe for a long time and -- and when I was there, I found that um, most countries were -- were a lot more um, sympathetic towards Israel --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- than towards the Palestinians, and but th- -- then I met this guy and he's actually become a really good friend of mine and he's a Palestinian but he's from Israel --
R:  Oh Jeeze.
L:  -- and he's a film maker and he's actually moved back there now to -- to make a couple of movies and he does, like, documentaries about the whole Middle East, um, issue --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and he has like, I mean, he's a very intelligent person and, you know, he -- he doesn't really have hatred towards a particular race or religion or anything like that, but obviously, you know, he has family that lives there all the time and he's had, you know, relatives that got killed and he's interviewed, like, some of these kids that are, you know, joining terrorist movements, so he has a very different perspective of the whole thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I mean, he just started telling me about stuff, and I mean, that was like, the tip of the iceberg.  I was like, there's no way I can even grasp all of this --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because there's so much history.
R:  And it goes so much further than, you know, just one life time.  I mean, and it --
L:  Exactly.
R:  I have friends -- I go to an international school out in Arizona --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and um, I have friends from both Syria and Palestine and Israel, like, all over the Middle East, and there's a chat page where we can go into our school's website and talk things through --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and it's interesting to go, like, at one point the debate between them got so heated that they had to shut the web page down for a week --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- because it was getting really bad.  And all these people are friends.  We have class together every day, we work with each other in groups, but it was --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and it was interesting because it wasn't just um, just bashing each other, it was point by point, like historical debate, and it started out as like, something that had happened in the press and somebody posted it and the article was slanted against um, Palestine --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so everybody who was on it, you know, Palestinian or Syrian or any affiliation with Palestine automatically spoke up --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and it was interesting because the history -- there's so much more history than I even knew, I mean --
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I can't even begin to -- to -- to understand it because, like, people have told me that, you know, um -- um the Palestinians basically sold their land to the Jews and now they want it back.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I -- you know, I -- I have no way of verifying whether that's true or not, because of course, they're telling a different story --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I wasn't there when it happened so I re- -- you know, I really don't know enough about the history to be able to say, well, you know, they're the ones that are lying and they're the ones that are telling the truth.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I think probably, you know, they're -- they're both at fault at certain, you know, things, but --
R:  Yeah, I think it's really hard for people to take blame for what they -- they -- you know, for what they did wrong because they feel they're justified in doing it for having ha- -- bared such loses --
L:  Right.
R:  But, I don't know, at the same time it's hard to even go back and read the history because I've tried and it's -- it's always slanted and as soon as you're like, wow, that was so wrong, then you read the other side's interpretation and you're like, but how can that be the same story?
L:  Right.
R:  It's like watching a TV show and two people come away with two different, like, versions of it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But 
L:  Yeah, but I mean, I think --
R:  It's definitely interesting.
L:  -- the only way that they're going to be able to move forward is to stop looking back all the time and start looking, you know, towards the future --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but it's, you know, somebody has got to start and I can see where, you know, I mean, different attempts have been made where they've said, okay, we're going to stop the violence and then of course there's always going to be people that are going to spoil that -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- by -- by abusing the situation and then the other side gets angry again and, you know, it --
R:  It just keeps going back and forward.
L:  -- yeah.  I mean what you were saying about that camp, I'm thinking, you know, that might actually be like, a really good idea.  Instead of having all these young kids, um, enrolled in -- in like, fighting programs and -- and army stuff, you know, forcing them to like, go into camp together --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- like all of them, like, a mandatory thing.  It's part of their education, and -- and --
R:  It would definitely be interesting.  It would be -- I -- I don't know how they could do it with people from Israel and Palestine though, running the camp.  I think it would probably have to be some kind of outside country running it, a more neutral country.
L:  Right.
R:  Otherwise it seems like it would just be a bit of a problem.
L:  Yeah.  But then you get the whole thing again where you know, which country is even neutral any more?
R:  Yeah, at this point --
L:  I know.
R:  -- everybody seems to have stepped up and said something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  One way or the other.  I almost think it's kind of like a lose lose situation.  No matter what you do, it's never enough and if you don't do anything then it's always worse --
L:  Right.
R:  -- then everyone says, well you should have done something.  It's like everybody blames Bush and every other president that we've had --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but it's like, what is the right action?  Nobody really can think of the right thing --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you're not going to please everyone.
L:  Right.  And I think, you know, people are going to have to cut their losses.  I mean, on both sides --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, there's just really no way around it.  But then I don't really know enough about the religious point of view either, to be able to say well, you know, because they're -- they're -- there's all kinds of stuff like, yeah, but if we give up this, this is our holy land and this is, you know, part of our heritage and this is part of our religious culture and you know, so that's making it even more difficult.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, it's -- in a way, it's even more complicated than the whole situation in Ireland.
R:  Oh yeah, definitely.
L:  Yeah.
R:  With the sh- -- the mutual land disputes and the -- and it sounds so easy just to think that people should just knock it off and kind of like, cut their losses and move on --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I think after so much of your family and friends and just a fear, after all those years, just generation after generation --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just because it's more and more difficult to say, okay, this isn't making it any better --
L:  Right.
R:  -- one of us needs to stop --
L:  Plus that there's -- there's still people that are being oppressed --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, there is obviously, you know, a lot of Palestinians that live in camps that really, you know, don't have a -- a chance in hell to make a life for themselves, so you know, they're not just going to sit back and -- and -- and say okay, you know. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I kind of understand that, um, you know.  I mean, not that that means it's okay for them to join, you know, a terrorist movement, but I can also see where they're not just going to sit back and -- and take it.
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  So.
R:  It would be difficult just to, you know, see one thing happen after another and just not to fight back.
L:  Right.
R:  I have a friend, and he's actually from Israel.  He was raised in the US but they go back every year for about a month or two --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and they moved to the US because, I guess it's mandatory military service for all people --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- within a certain age.
L:  Women also.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Which is interesting, because you don't have that here.  But his family actually came here until all the kids are past that age range so that they don't have to serve.
L:  Wow.
R:  Which, in a way, is kind of sad because it's like it is your country and you do need to do what, you know, if everybody --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- else is doing it, I think I would have a problem like, feeling okay with it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but at the same time I wouldn't want to put my kids in harm's way either.
L:  No.  I've met, um, in Europe, I met a couple of people from Israel and they had all served in the army --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and they had all been involved in -- in heavy combat.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, it's not like, you know, they're just patrolling stuff --
R:  No.
L:  -- I mean, they would -- you know, most of them had actually shot people.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they just view it as a normal part of life, and I'm thinking, wow, you know, what kind of a life is that?
R:  Yeah, that --
L:  That's heavy.
R:  -- you know, getting killed every day when you leave your house
