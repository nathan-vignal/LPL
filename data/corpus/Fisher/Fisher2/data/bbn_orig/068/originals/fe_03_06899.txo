R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  How are you?
L:  I'm fine.
R:  I'm Jim.
L:  I'm Tania.
R:  Where -- where you at?
L:  I'm in Kansas.
R:  You're in Kansas.  We're -- we're a little bit south of you.  We're down here in south east Texas.
L:  Oh, really?  My husband's from Waco.
R:  Well, we're about ninety something miles from Waco.
L:  I see.
R:  We're-- we're -- we're between Waco and Houston.
L:  Okay.  My -- his family lives in College Station.
R:  Well, we- we're thirty miles from there.
L:  Okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I know where that is then.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  The c- current unrest in the Middle East.  Boy, what a topic, huh?
L:  Oh, yeah. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It couldn't have been any broader [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, well you -- you -- like it's gonna -- there's gonna be unrest in the Middle East for -- for the rest of history.
L:  I think [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't think that there'll ever be much but that there [LAUGH].
R:  No.  We -- we-- we -- we can try but they never learn.  You go back and read the Bible and see what happened there.
L:  That's right.
R:  And, uh, you know, all -- all the time through -- through biblical times and even up to today, about the time they get it settled, they go back to fighting again.
L:  That's right.  That's very true [LAUGH].
R:  You know, we -- you know, I don't know -- I didn't understand everything she said but you know, whether -- whether we ought be involved.  I don't know if that's what she's talking about.
L:  I think -- yeah, I think that's part of it.  I think -- I think as far as the peace process goes, I -- I don't think that they have any other means of really getting a democratic, you know, party going over there so something --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, that we could 'em with would possible be that.
R:  Well, look -- look when the cold war ended in Russia --
L:  True.
R:  -- and, uh, they tried to get a democracy --
L:  True.
R:  -- and they've lived under dictatorship for some many years, they don't know how to live under democracy.
L:  Right [COUGH].  Right.
R:  You know, I -- I know we've done some good but they can -- you know, by taking, uh, uh, Saddam Hussein out but we should have taken him out years ago.
L:  Yeah, the first time [LAUGH].
R:  The first time and -- and --
L:  And I still don't think he's gone.
R:  Uh, I think he is but, uh, I'd still like to see proof of it [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah [NOISE] I think he is, but I -- I'd -- I'd like to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- see -- see the body.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I just -- I don't know.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Just may be a gut feeling or something.  I just feel like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- he -- he's not quite gone yet [LAUGH].
R:  You know, and -- and the, uh, -- and the, uh, uh, bin Laden --
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I -- I -- I -- I wish he was gone.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I wish.
R:  'Cause you know when -- when he's gone --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a lot of his, uh --
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Is that -- that -- that a child or is that a parrot?
L:  Yes, that's my son [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, my daughter's just walked in and she's had her kids, uh, swimming today and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- the little one, he is red as a beet on the back.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] She said that was with sunscreen.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH].
R:  But --
L:  But --
R:  You know, I -- you'll -- we -- we -- we'll never -- we -- we -- we can't -- well, we're there.  We'll be there, you know, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- from now on to keep peace.
L:  Yeah, I -- [NOISE] I agree.
R:  May -- yeah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- may -- maybe there'll be some, uh, some closure --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there because you -- we -- we get the people educated --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- where they aren't afraid to walk outside and where they're, you know --
L:  Right [NOISE]
R:  There's a few of them that's beginning to -- to -- to -- to show -- show their true colors and -- and realize hey, you know, he -- you know, we haven't had anybody shot just for speaking their piece here in a few months.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Right, exactly [LAUGH].  That's definitely be a change.
R:  Right.  It's -- it's been a big change and some of them don't know how to accept it and some of them are trying and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- all -- all we can do it keep on trying, I guess.
L:  Yeah, I -- I think that [MN] um, the more people that we put over there, I think it might tend to frighten them a little more, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  May be -- maybe take out a few and that would help.
R:  [NOISE] Yes.
L:  Kinda ease the process a little.
R:  Uh, yeah.  Well, you know, what -- what -- if we can find the right person to be the leader, that -- that won't be a dictator --
L:  Right.
R:  -- which is gonna be hard to do --
L:  Right.
R:  -- uh, you -- you -- the -- the older people that's all they know is the dictatorship and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the younger people, you know, all they want is power.
L:  Right, and --
R:  [LAUGH] So, you're gonna be -- be right back to the same place where they started from.
L:  [LAUGH] Exactly.  Yeah  [COUGH] so, it's -- it's kind of a tough call.  You know, I mean, I think that some of our people should be over there like I said, you know, just to kinda --
R:  Right.
L:  -- work 'em through things but, you know, like you said too if there's too many over there, then --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, it's just gonna --
R:  Send too many over there and the rest of the world is gonna say, "Yeah, you all just went over there to take it over for oil".  Well, that --
L:  Right, exactly [LAUGH].
R:  That -- that -- that wasn't the purpose of taking it over.  I -- I think we ever find the weapons of mass destruction that I know is there, that's gonna wake everybody in the world up.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And they're there [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, they're there.  They're just in many tunnels and caves and everything else.
L:  Oh, that's right.
R:  It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Yeah, it's gonna be -- it's gonna take years and years to find everything that's over there.
R:  Yeah.  They -- yeah, as long as we keep looking, it's gonna be turned up.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But look -- look at all the money that they found there --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- that nobody knew he had --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- stowed away.
L:  [LAUGH] Yep.  All of it stored every place but, yeah [COUGH] it's definitely gonna -- gonna wake some people up when it's all found.
R:  Oh, yeah.  And I -- I -- well, I -- I was in the beginning of Vietnam war when we --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- went over there.  At least this is a -- yeah, at least -- at least we'd gone over there to -- to win these.
L:  Right [LAUGH].
R:  And, uh, the technology of the weapons is so much better what we had back then that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we've been able to take out -- take out one building and not even damage the next building.
L:  Exactly.  Yeah, that's -- that's just phenomenal.
R:  It really is.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] And -- and now --
L:  And like the heat seeking missiles where they can program 'em, you know, to -- to --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I mean, that's just wow [LAUGH].
R:  Got -- got 'em right into where they wanna go.
L:  Right, right.
R:  You know, I was talking to somebody the other day.  They said they -- they -- they've now got, uh, hand held weapons that they don't even have to stick their head up above the foxhole.  They -- they stick the weapon up there and look at the screen --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- down in the foxhole and aim it where -- where they want it to go.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I didn't know that [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's -- that's wow [LAUGH].  Very technological.
R:  But, you know, America's got so much more technology that the rest of the world don't have that, uh --
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
R:  They just don't know -- yeah, they don't know what we've got.
L:  Right [COUGH].
R:  What I can't --
L:  Sometimes that's to our disadvantage [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  People are wanting it [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, yeah.  A lot of people want it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I was listening to one of -- one of the radio shows the other day.  I don't even remember who it was.  I got so mad I finally turned him off --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because -- because he said that, uh, that the trade -- that the planes didn't actually run into the [NOISE] you know, run into the trade centers and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- bring 'em down.  That it was bombs that was planted inside that brought 'em down --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- and he said he talked to pilots and pilots said it -- said a professional pilot couldn't have -- couldn't have taken the planes in there and hit -- hit the way they did.
L:  Hm.
R:  I don't think he knew what he was talking about.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I think if too many people had of heard that, he might of --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [LAUGH] he might have been in trouble [LAUGH].
R:  [NOISE]
L:  'Cause that was -- yes, that was a bad ordeal.
R:  Well, our ten minutes ought to be up I think.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's pretty quick [LAUGH].
L:  In another minute I think.
R:  Oh, okay [LAUGH].
L:  So ...
R:  Wh- wh- where in Kansas are you?
L:  Um, I'm by Wichita.
R:  By Wichita, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've -- I've got a cousin that's, uh, up in the north west corner that's a wheat farmer.
L:  OH, yeah.  Wheat.  Lots of that around here [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  My grandpa was a wheat farmer.  Yep.  There's -- where does he live up -- up there?
R:  [NOISE] I can't remember the name [NOISE] of the town.  I know it's way in the north west corner.
L:  Yeah.  Probably over by Lake Colby and over there.
R:  Yeah, some- somewhere over there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We was up there a few years ago.
L:  There is nothing over there [LAUGH].
R:  W- w- we drove up to Salt Lake --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and went -- went up that away and across Colorado and --
L:  Oh, yeah.  That'd be pretty.
R:  Oh, we had a good drive.
L:  Yeah, [NOISE] that would be nice.  We used to go to Colorado for our vacation so [LAUGH] when I was little [NOISE].
R:  Well, I -- I hope the weather up there at Kansas is cooler than it was here today.
L:  It was really nice here today.  It was hot, hot, hot yesterday and then it only about seventy today.
R:  Well, they -- they told us -- well, we were ninety degrees yesterday and I think --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- we hit it again today.
L:  Oh, goodness. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and the humidity down there kills me [LAUGH].
R:  Well, uh, today it's about thirty percent.  We haven't had any rain in so long that everything's drying up again.
L:  Oh, goodness.  Yeah, his mum and dad last year had problems with not having any -- any precipitation for a while so ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And we were like, "You can have some of ours" [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Because we were flooding and all kinds of stuff last year.
R:  Oh, yeah we --
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Somebody's having fun.
L:  Yeah, he knows it's almost bedtime [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  Oh [LAUGH].  How old is he?
L:  He's a year and a half.
R:  Oh [LAUGH].
L:  [NOISE]
R:  This -- this -- this one my daughter just came in with is almost four.
L:  Oh [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that ...
