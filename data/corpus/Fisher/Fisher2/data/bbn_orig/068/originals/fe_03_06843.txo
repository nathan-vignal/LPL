R:  H- --
L:  Hi, I'm Deborah, from California.
R:  Hi --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I'm Becky.  I'm in Florida. [NOISE]
L:  Hi Becky! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH].  Er, do you wanna start, or do you want me to start? [LAUGH].
L:  Um, sure.  I think it heightened -- um, heightened -- what is it?  Heightened security --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- protects us better.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Sure, I think it does.
R:  Yeah.  I think it does too.  It makes me feel better too, as a -- a passenger.
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  Definitely.
L:  -- kind of dread it though [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, yeah.  That's true [LAUGH].
L:  Have you flown any since?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Have you really? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  And it's -- it -- yeah.  [LIPSMACK] It -- it really [MN] slowed the process down --
L:  I would imagine.
R:  -- and, you know, it would really make [NOISE] me think twice about, er, traveling with my kids [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  Trying to have them stand there and wait in the lines, and what not.  [NOISE]  But it does make me feel a lot safer.
L:  Yeah.  Well, obviously --
R:  [NOISE].
L:  -- it's made a difference because nothing terrible has happened, so  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  It -- do you have a baby in the background?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Did -- did you need to check or something?
R:  No, it's okay.
L:  I could just keep on talking! [LAUGH].
R:  No.  I can keep on talking.  My husband's  --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- supposed to be watching him, so  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, good [LAUGH].
R:  But, yeah.  I -- I, um, I definitely -- it -- it does make me feel better.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I -- j- -- the whole thing -- I [MN] -- I'm -- I thought we had pretty good security before that [NOISE], you know, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, um, apparently it wasn't good enough --
L:  Well, what we --
R:  I -- I was just --
L:  -- what we didn't have was people who were, you know, gonna commit suicide by blowing themselves up.  I mean --
R:  Right!
L:  -- we -- h- how can you -- how can you plan for something like that?  I mean --
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  -- how can you figure some other being's gonna do that.
R:  That's true.  It's [NOISE] scary.  I mean, since that.  Then there was [NOISE] the, er, the shoe bombing thing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or trying to be the shoe bombing [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, yes.
R:  And, I mean all these things that they can't predict, I guess --
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's what worries me.  Like, what are they gonna try to do next --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- bio terror.  That kind of thing.  Th- that does concern me --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- [NOISE] for airplane travel, as well --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know.  And, um, but, yes I think definitely that it does --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- make us more secure [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  What kinda gets me though is they show this picture of th- -- like, this little -- little blonde haired little boy in the airport --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and he had his arms out and they were doing the airport secu- -- this little scanner thing, you know, --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- and all.  And you just think, "Come on now, you --
R:  Y- -- I know.
L:  -- you know that little kid's not a terrorist.
R:  I know.
L:  I mean, come on. 
R:  I know.  You j- -- you know, I know -- you know, I think too -- it's the same thing [NOISE] with, er, my husband's grandmother.  
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  She gets checked all the time --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- She's got a metal knee --
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, gees.
R:  -- and so they always pull her aside [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, no!
R:  -- Because she sets off the alert [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, poor thing!
R:  Yeah, and so it's like [NOISE], "Come on!".  And yet --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- who knows, you know, what they're gonna be using.  You know --
L:  Mm.  Yeah.
R:  -- I guess you just never know who the terrorists are gonna be.
L:  No.  W- --
R:  But I think, to me that also kinda pulls the whole profiling --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- issue into it.  Who they're gonna stop and 
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I just -- I -- I'm surprised that people [NOISE] are against the profiling, I guess, because [MN] that's who's doing it. [NOISE] 
L:  Mhm.  
R:  The males of that --
L:  I know -- I know -- no, you're right, you're right.
R:  -- you know.  I -- I had said when this whole thing happened, "Hey, if it was, you know, thirty something house stay at home mothers that had done this I wouldn't be offended --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if they searched me, because I don't wanna get killed either, you know [LAUGH].
L:  No, I know, yeah.  Mhm.  Right.
R:  So, I know, it's -- it's kind of a -- that whole debate that's been going around about that, so 
L:  But, we've had years now of it being ingrained in us that we have to be politically correct.
R:  Right.
L:  So, we can't talk about that [LAUGH].  You know --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  -- but it's true!  Terrorists look like terrorists!  I mean, how can you not say, you know, [LAUGH].
R:  Right.
L:  It's not that everyone that looks like that is a terrorist, but --
R:  Right.  But historically, that's whose --
L:  Well, yeah [LAUGH] --
R:  -- been doing it, so --
L:  Yeah.  So how can we -- I know.
R:  I know.  It's hard.  And I -- I sympathize with those people, I guess --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that are offended, but I mean, I'm sorry, when I go to the airport, if I see a group of guys standing around -- you know what I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that -- that look that way, that --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- makes me nervous.
L:  By themselves, yeah.  You would [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.  So  [LAUGH]. 
L:  I know.  What would you do?  You wouldn't wanna get on a plane --
R:  I probably wouldn't --
L:  -- with them.
R:  -- especially -- I mean, you try to -- I mean --
L:  Oh 
R:  -- I don't wanna think ill of everybody, but you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- probably wouldn't wanna --
L:  No [LAUGH].
R:  -- get on?  Or, especially, if I'm with my kids --
L:  No.
R:  -- I just, um --
L:  Mm, mm.
R:  -- it makes me nervous.  But --
L:  No.
R:  -- I don't know.  I do.  And -- when they put in the national guard and everything else that was going on at the airport --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for a while, I though that -- okay, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I thought it was good but, er, -- [MN] you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I -- I -- it -- the -- the level definitely went up, you know.  How safe you are still, I don't know, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You haven't -- you haven't flown at all?
L:  No, um, just -- not because of that but just because it hasn't come up. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  We haven't really taken any vacations or anything.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  But, I -- I wouldn't mind the flying, but there's something inside of me just dreads going through the airport and going through the whole --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think I'm gonna feel like a criminal [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- or something, and I'm not!
R:  It's j- --
L:  And I don't know why, it's just this weird thing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I just don't wanna do that.
R:  No.  I've only gone once and I didn't have my kids -- it was for, um, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a trip home real quick and I flew all the way across the country and it was -- but I left so early in the morning that I cleared security really quickly, which was nice --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but they really, you know, you gotta take your shoes off and if you're wearing a coat you've got to take your coat off and they wand everybody.  And you've gotta put your bags through, and so, in that regard it made me feel better --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that every person was being checked, you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- know.  You don't know who you're gonna sit -- you know, it just makes you more alert, I guess of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- who you're sitting next to and [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  -- and what not, so  [inaudible word] what else, um --
L:  Some of it seems to go a little overboard though.  Th- -- it -- sometimes the stories, like, scare me.  Like, the man who -- he was arrested because -- it was during the anthrax, um, -- the whole heightened anthrax thing --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and he opened a card and confetti came out, or something, and somebody --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- thought he was spreading anthrax and they arrested him --
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  -- for, like, two days before he could just prove that he --
R:  Right.  It --
L:  -- was not a terrorist --
R:  -- wasn't that yet.  That's --
L:  -- that it was just confetti coming out of a card, or something.
R:  Yeah.  That is scary.  It is scary and it -- but, I guess, you know, everything has to be investigated.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, no, the same thing when they shut down the Atlanta airport -- when that guy --
L:  -- Oh, I remember that --
R:  -- yeah!  Ran past security.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  But in that case, that guy deserved what he got because --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- you don't run through security that close after September eleventh [LAUGH].
L:  No, uh-uh.  You --
R:  And not expect to get, you know.
L:  You don't that OJ Simpson thing of running --
R:  Exactly!
L:  -- through the airport --
R:  Exactly, exactly!
L:  -- anymore, right?  No.
R:  Right!  But I think, though in that case, that was good.  They shut down -- I think they shut --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- down, um, another airport since then too.  I think that wasn't the only time that it has happened.  So --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when they do see something it does seem like they're on the ball, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't think anything is foolproof.
L:  No, mm, mm.
R:  And I'm not a big person that likes to fly, either [LAUGH], you know.
L:  No, mm, mm.
R:  So it kinda, you know, -- it wouldn't dissuade me from flying again.  I keep seeing, you know, lots of friends and relatives flying around and no problems, so --
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  -- I think I'd definitely be able to [LIPSMACK] do it again but I would just be more concerned just with --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- little kids and what not, and traveling like that, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  So  Where abouts are you in California?
L:  In Southern California.  
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  A -- a little town, sort of near Disneyland.
R:  Oh, okay.  We used to live in San Diego, for a while.
L:  That's beautiful down there.
R:  Yeah.  We liked that.  But we're outside Tampa now and we -- [LIPSMACK] we love it, so 
L:  That's good.
R:  Yeah, so, I don't know, -- I don't know much more to say about airport security [LAUGH].
L:  Well h- -- yesterday the topic was "Should sports --
R:  [LAUGH] Yes!
L:  -- should athletes, er --
R:  I did that one too!
L:  -- be able to -- did you?
R:  Yeah.  Did you?
L:  I hung up because I thought, "What am I going to say?"  I don't know anything about sports.  I have an opinion but it's like, one second [LAUGH], you know?
R:  Yeah.  I know.  I did that -- I have -- well, I had some opinions about it, just because --
L:  That's good!
R:  -- I think they --
L:  That's good.
R:  -- make too much money.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, yeah, it's kind of hard to talk --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- eight to ten minutes about that, like, yes [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  This is a neat study though.
L:  Yeah.  This is kind of fun --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- although I never talk, so  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  It's just good practice.
R:  Yeah, really.  I just don't --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- The guy I talked to yesterday had a lot of opinions so, yeah, I let him do a lot of the talking.
L:  Oh, that's good!
R:  I piped up every so often --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, I was thinking, "Okay, ten minutes, yeah [LAUGH].
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  It is hard to stay on track, so   I -- we must have been done at least eight minutes.  I -- I'd -- I'd figure we've got --
L:  Yeah, I think we're okay.
R:  Yeah, I think we're okay, so   How did you hear about this study?
L:  Um, online.
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  In the Refunding Cents.  Have you ever heard of that?
R:  What is it called?
L:  Um, Refund Cents dot com.
R:  Huh-uh [PAUSE].  No.
L:  It's kind of like, my coupons, or --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- but, i- -- it's like tied into the magazine subscription, so you have to have a password to get in.
R:  Oh, okay.  I was just doing a search, and, I think, it was like Vendio dot com, or s- --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- something like that.  I don't even recall --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- how I got to the site.  I was just --
L:  [MN] Oh, that's good.
R:  -- looking for surveys, or, you know, translators[?], online surveys, kind of things, and 
L:  I have really cut back.  I started to get into it for a while, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you can spend so much time and not [MN] really get anything back, you know.
R:  That is so true. 
L:  But --
R:  Very true.
L:  So, I -- really cut back. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's just not like it --
R:  Mm, mm.  No.  They advertise it as, "Oh, yeah, you can make all this money, and, so --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- many of them are scams, you know.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Mhm.
R:  So, I have researched very heavily into a lot of the different things that are out there, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they're all, [MN] you know.
L:  I think, yeah.
R:  Pretty much, all the time they want you to pay them money [LAUGH], you know.
L:  Oh, yeah, always --
R:  You know, it's a bad idea --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  So  but 
L:  When you did, like, go through the airport --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- did you, like, -- how do you get your tickets now?  How did you --
R:  Their tic-
L:  -- do it?
R:  -- it was still ticketless.  I bought them over the internet.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And then, um, you know, print out the receipt, and then --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- went in and showed your ID.  Now, for a long time they didn't have curbside baggage --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but now they do again.  I think maybe --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- certain airlines do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, and, er, and showed ID and went from there but they said, "You can't lock your luggage", because they want the right to inspect it which kinda stinks because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, I have hard sided luggage and I'm thinking, "Okay, well, I don't mind if they go through it, but what if they don't shut it properly --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- and somebody throws it and it opens?"
L:  Yes.
R:  You know --
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  -- so, [MN] -- so, like, yeah, I don't know.  They just pick them at random, I -- I guess, to -- to, er, rifle through the stuff.  But, yeah, it was no different than --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and I just flew recently.  I mean, it was just --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- February that I went, so I think a lot of things have gone
