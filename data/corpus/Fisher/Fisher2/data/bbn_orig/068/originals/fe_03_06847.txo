L:  My name's Diane.
R:  I'm sorry, what was that?
L:  Diane.
R:  Hi.  I'm Laura.
L:  Oh, hi, Laura. [NOISE]
R:  Hi [LAUGH].  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, I guess our topic is airport security?
L:  Uh-huh and if [NOISE] we think it lessens the, um, [NOISE] possibility or the risk of terrorism at the --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- airport.
R:  What do you think about that? [LAUGH]
L:  I think that it does --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I think that, um, [NOISE] I -- you know, there's -- I think that there's always [SIGH] people that are gonna try and get past the system, you know, and they're gonna try and find [NOISE] new ways to [NOISE]  get by the checkpoints and get by, um, the security that's in place, but I think that it's a good thing [NOISE] and I think that it does, um, keep some of the activity, you know, down. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  I think the same way.  I mean, it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's a pain to go through --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I've traveled a couple of times, [LAUGH] um, but, you know, I think it -- it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- good that they're at least trying --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- even though there will be ways to get around it.
L:  Mhm.  Right.
R:  I [SIGH] --
L:  I don't travel hardly at all and so I don't know that, [NOISE] you know, so I can't come from that standpoint of [NOISE] being a traveler and having to experience the difficulties in the lines and in things slowing down, but, um   But I think that it's worth it, if it -- if it's gonna save lives and they're gonna [NOISE] keep people safe.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I wonder what would have happened, [MN] um, you know, with nine eleven if -- if we were to have these things in place before that, you know.  You just wonder if it would have, um, [NOISE] kept th- -- that from happening.
R:  Well, that's kind of a whole different topic to me because, I think, nine eleven was not preventable by airport security, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's just my opinion. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think that the airport security is probably more likely to stop your -- your ordinary type --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- person --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- who might want to copycat the hijackers --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or, whose just, you know, like the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- hijackings we used to have back in the, um, seventies.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  A- -- you're probably not old enough to remember that. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I -- I've heard about it.  I was born in the seventies, so I, um, --
R:  [LAUGH].  Okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I've heard about it and know of it but not -- I don't remember it first hand.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I s-  I was old enough to remember it and, er --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think it's more likely to stop people like that.  But --
L:  Mhm.  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think nine eleven --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- was carefully planned and possibly --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- assisted by insiders, and, [SIGH] er --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- I just. [NOISE]  I just don't --
L:  That makes -- 
R:  -- that --
L:  -- that makes sense.
R:  I found --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  I found it pretty inconsistent though --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in my- -- in the only -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the two times I've traveled.  Um --
L:  The security's inconsistent?
R:  The security's been pretty inconsistent.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They will check things that, I don't know, just seem --
L:  Random.
R:  Yeah, they're random.  I mean, like --
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  -- once they carefully inspected a game cube.  And, it was a game cube.  I guess it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- could have been modified into a bomb --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but.  And then other things they --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- didn't check at all.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So it's things that look suspicious --
R:  I guess.
L:  -- and what looks suspicious to one person might not --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to somebody else [NOISE].  And, so it -- yeah, I can [NOISE] understand how that would make it [NOISE] difficult.  But then you think, you know, [NOISE] is it possible for them to check everything?
R:  No.  [LAUGH]  It's --
L:  You know --
R:  -- not. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  Is that realistic?  And, [SIGH] -- and so it, you know, it's how far --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- do we go.  How far do we --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- take this to be --
R:  I think --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's basically the training of the personnel.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  You know.  How to spot people that are suspicious looking and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um.  They carefully checked my thirteen --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- year old and, I mean, to me he looks like a normal thirteen year old [LAUGH].
L:  [NOISE] Mhm, mhm.
R:  But I guess it's better that they try -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- than not do anything at all.
L:  Than just assume that everybody e- -- I guess they have to have [NOISE] the mind set that everybody's a potential threat --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- instead of, you know, just even though, no matter how somebody looks they just have to be in that mindset that it could be a- -- it could be anybody.
R:  Yeah.  I guess though some people would argue against the cost.
L:  [NOISE] Yes.
R:  You know.  Is it really cost --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- effective to --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- do this if we're not really stopping anybody?
L:  [NOISE] Right.  Right.  Because, er, stuff that happens -- [SIGH] you know, 'cause ah, my mind keeps [NOISE] going to, you know, preventing things once they're on the plane but that's a whole different --
R:  Right, giving the ... [LAUGH]
L:  -- topic.  You know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.  Giving them, er, guns in the --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- cockpit [LAUGH].  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  You know, I keep -- my mind keeps going to that and I keep going, "All right, now that's not -- that's a whole different topic than what happens at the airport, and the screening, and ".  I guess they could say, you know, "No carry ons", you know, that would be --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- I would hate that, as a traveler [LAUGH] [NOISE].
R:  Yeah [LAUGH]
L:  You know.  [NOISE]  But I guess if they get to the most severe, they could -- you know, but then that doesn't prevent, you know, the bombs, or whatever [NOISE] in the luggage that's being carried on, but -- but it is interesting too.  I'm glad I'm not in charge of it [LAUGH] [NOISE].
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  Me too.  I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I keep thinking that some -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- of the things they do are -- are not really very effective --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- but I wouldn't know how to change it.
L:  [NOISE].  Right.  Right.  You know, you just ...  Yeah, and then it's the people that, um, [NOISE]   And I appreciate it when they ask people's input and ask --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- you know, what, um, -- how this affects you and -- and what you think and -- and sometimes I think that gets them in more trouble or makes things more difficult when they're [NOISE] trying to get everybody's opinion 'cause they're not gonna please everybody. 
R:  No. [NOISE]
L:  And they're not going to appease [NOISE] everybody --
R:  It --
L:  -- but 
R:  It did bother me though.  One of their air support -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- air, er, airport security measures where I had a lot of difficulty going to meet my elderly dad --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- at -- at the gate.
L:  Ooh.
R:  I was very concerned that he was not going to be able to make it from --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the gate to the baggage area.
L:  Yes.
R:  And he was too proud to ask for assistance.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  Typical man [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  But there was no one at the airport who could give me clearance to go --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- meet my dad --
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  They said I had to get it from the airline and the airline was already closed for the evening.  It was one of those little airlines.
L:  Ahah.
R:  I think it was Frontier or something.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So no one was at the desk and since no one was at the Frontier desk, nobody in the whole airport could --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- give me clearance to go --
L:  That's --
R:  -- meet my dad --
L:  -- too bad.  Yeah.  That -- that -- I think that's wrong.  I think that there should be, um [NOISE] --
R:  Some kind of central location, maybe --  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that you can --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- confirm that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you're a relative of a passenger, or something.
L:  [NOISE].  Right.  And show that you're okay [NOISE].  
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  [NOISE]  You know, and not gonna be -- you know, have the wand passed over you, or whatever.  It's to show that you --
R:  Or even have a security guard go with me --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know --
L:  Oh, sure.
R:  -- or something.
L:  That's -- yeah.  That's [NOISE] 
R:  That was terribly frustrating [LAUGH]
L:  That would be very frustrating because then you're [NOISE] -- yeah. 
R:  He did --
L:  'Cause then --
R:  -- make it to the baggage thing but [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh [NOISE].
R:  But, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- he -- he might not have.
L:  Mhm [NOISE].  Right.  That is [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- pretty extreme.  Especially when you can't get the help.  I can see how that would be --
R:  Oh yeah.  I was pretty upset too [LAUGH].
L:  -- very frustrating --
R:  I let people know about it [LAUGH].
L:  -- and very upsetting.  [NOISE]  That's too bad.  And they say its in the name of security, but [SIGH] there are instances and there are [NOISE] exceptions to -- to that. 
R:  Yes.  And it was fairly early on in the -- in the program, so, maybe they have improved that.
L:  Ahah.
R:  Um, I haven't --
L:  Ahah, yeah.  I'll bet you're --
R:  -- had to do that --
L:  -- not the only one [NOISE] that that's happened to.
R:  No.  And I -- I think they may have changed the rules about minors traveling al- -- traveling alone because you have the same problem with minor children.
L:  Right! Right.  [NOISE]  Because you can't go and be right there when they [NOISE] -- when they come off.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That's one thing that I'm very bummed with.  All the security stuff -- is you can't go up there and be when -- there when the [NOISE] plane, you know, [NOISE] see -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [NOISE] them coming off the plane.  I love that part --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of going to pick somebody up, er, is -- is being there when they --
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  -- when they come off and ...
R:  I -- I guess it -- the point of it was to decrease access to the planes themselves.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, I mean --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- going up --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the, em, what do you call it?  The -- the -- the airport place where you get on the airplane [LAUGH].  I forget the name of it [LAUGH].
L:  The concourse?
R:  Concourse, yeah.
L:  Ahah.  
R:  Um.  I don't know.  That doesn't really give you access to the plane so I'm not really sure why they limited people --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- from going up the concourse.
L:  It could be that its less people to watch, too.
R:  Yeah, um --
L:  [NOISE]  You know, less people to keep track off when you [NOISE] -- you've just got people coming off and --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- not 
R:  -- less people that have to go through security.  Because security is before --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you get on the concourse.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  Which, I guess, makes sense.
L:  Not as much screaming and -- and all that if they're not even allowed --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- on there, so ...  I know.  But, it's -- it is a difficult ...  This [MN] -- this is an interesting topic.  I just never -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- really thought that much about it in, you know, --
R:  You haven't had --
L:  -- I don't have --
R:  -- to travel since they started this?
L:  [NOISE].  No.  Mm, mm.
R:  Oh, you're lucky. [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, [NOISE] I'm not a traveler at all.  I love it.  I love to travel and I love to [NOISE] -- to go flying and -- and -- but I'm -- I don't do much at all.
R:  The funny thing is that most other forms of transportation don't require any security and that's probably where the next --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- terrorist threat will come from.  It's something that's unprotected.
L:  Ahah.  [NOISE]. 
R:  You can get on a Greyhound bus --
L:  That's true!
R:  -- with a ticket and not even show your ID.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, wow!  Wow --
R:  I know 'cause I put my son on one [LAUGH].
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  He's like, "Oh, I didn't need my ID.  I just --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- showed him my ticket" [LAUGH].
L:  [NOISE] Just showed him and got on.  Oh, my goodness ...
