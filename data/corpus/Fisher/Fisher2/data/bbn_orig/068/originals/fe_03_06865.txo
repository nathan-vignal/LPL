L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, my name is Carol.
L:  I'm sorry, Carol?
R:  Yes.
L:  Yes hi, my name is Dana.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  Um, well, regarding the heightened security --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I think, um, yes, it'd be -- it would be helpful in order to reduce terrorism.
L:  You know, I think it does too.  I think, you know, I think just broadcasting that they're doing it helps reduce it. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh yes, because I -- I -- especially if -- if -- if -- if -- people are aware, then I think they'll be a little bit more cautious in trying to, um, take weapons.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I -- I -- I think it'll I -- you know, like, when I -- when I listen to the news and, um, they -- they speak about the -- the heightened security --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I would think yeah, um, you'd be more cautious. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I -- I definitely, because I know, we just had -- we had an incident where, um, gosh, it was -- ah, it was the Christmas of two thousand and one and we were flying back home and our flight had been cancelled, and so they put us on another airline, and the, um, my husband told me, he said, "You wait", he said, "We're all going to be searched because we fit the profile because since we're on another airline they show it as a cash ticket, single trip".  In other words not a round trip, just one destination.  And he said, "That's the profile they're looking for", and sure enough, all four of us were searched.  We were pulled off to the side and we were searched because we fit the profile.  And I think, you know, just letting people know that, that, you know, the, you know, they're going to be looking.  I think it's worth it.
R:  Oh yes, yes, definitely.  I don't know if -- if -- if that's, um, nation wide?  Is it something that is done in each state?
L:  Yes, as far as I know it is, and ah, everybody that I've talked to --
R:  Well, I also know that they -- don't they ha- -- like -- for like -- I don't know if it's certain people, like --
L:  You know, I don't know.  I don't know for -- I know, you know, there are certain things like --
R:  I think -- I think -- this line isn't -- isn't so great here because I can barely hear what you're saying. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, I'm sorry. [LAUGH] I'm pretty --
R:  I don't know if it's your phone or my phone.
L:  I -- I don't -- I hear you fine.
R:  Oh, you do, okay.  I -- I'm -- I'm barely hearing what you're saying, so I just thought I'd let you know that. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh dear, I'm holding it as close as I can.  I don't know --
R:  Okay, okay, I can barely, barely hear what you're saying.
L:  Yeah, I know, ah, my -- my father in law just flew out here this weekend and he said they had him take his shoes off, you know, for some -- they liked the shoes. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Th- -- th- -- they taken off -- now I can hear you better. [LAUGH] They're um, they're taking off -- taking off shoes?
L:  Yes, they, you know, make you take off your shoes and they check your feet and everything, and um --
R:  Oh, okay, oh, what can you -- on your -- oh, I guess your shoes, yeah, you can --
L:  Yeah, because of the one guy from, ah, the -- the plane from London, Richard Harris, had the shoes -- the bombs in his shoe.
R:  Oh yes, I -- yeah, I guess you can pretty much, ah, hide something anywhere.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Although, you know, this -- my father in law's an eighty eight year old man. [LAUGH] You don't really think that he fits, you know, he would fit the profile, but they had him remove his shoes anyway. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.  He didn't have anything though? [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] No. [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] No, not at all.  But, ah, I think --
R:  What percent- -- do you know the percentage that -- that it actually, ah, reduces?
L:  You know, I don't.  I don't.
R:  Terrorism?  Or do you think maybe some people just don't care at all? [LAUGH] Hide whatever they can. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, yeah, I don't know if, like, there's a mandate for the -- the people that are checking at the airport either.  In other words, they have to pull aside a certain percentage of each plane load.
R:  Oh, it's just a percentage.
L:  I don't know.  That's what I'm saying.
R:  Okay, because I knew, yeah, I knew you got to ah, like, whatever -- whatever your, um, don't they go through, like, a screen?  Whatever, um, you're carrying, like your luggage --
L:  Yeah.  I know that I -- they put your luggage on an x-ray machine --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- yes, and then, ah --
R:  Well that they've been doing, I mean, they've been doing that -- isn't that something they do -- they've been doing for several years now?
L:  Yeah, but more so.  More so now.
R:  Now they're doing it more --
L:  Yeah, because --
R:  Yeah, well now I figure it -- um, because of this Iraq situation --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and um, I think there's like a -- there's -- there's another group now.  What is -- what is their name?  I'm trying to think of like, that group, that terrorist group in -- I think they're -- they're in Iran.
L:  Mm, I don't know.
R:  Excuse me?
L:  I'm not -- I don't know which one you're talking about.
R:  Yes, there's a- -- Al Qaeda.  Al Qaeda. 
L:  Oh, yes, yes.
R:  I mean, I think they've made -- they've made several recent threats.
L:  Oh yes, yes, I -- that -- that's right, the um, the national a- -- alert was highered, or made --
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, made higher because of that.  Yeah, so --
R:  I think -- I think also a lot of people are, like, ah, afraid now to travel. [LAUGH] 
L:  Do you think so?  See, I --
R:  Some people are not going to want to travel, they say, well all this terrorism that's going on --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I guess for the airlines, that's not good for the airlines. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well that's true.  The airlines are having a hard time.  That is true.
R:  Yeah, but I mean if the airlines, I mean, you know, make people aware of what they're -- you know, that they are taking all these precautions and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- when people are traveling.
L:  Well, you know, and too -- I really truly feel that whatever we're doing must be working because you know that there were probably some other things that they wanted to do, that didn't happen.  So, I don't know if it's the checking of the airplanes or if it's better intelligence or whatever it is --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think that whatever we're doing must be working to some degree.
R:  Oh yes, yes I'm sure. 
L:  So 
R:  They also have the, um, the mail -- that mail -- that mail scare.
L:  Yes, yes, that --
R:  -- and they've got the SARS going on, so they've got -- you know [LAUGH] 
L:  I know.  I know, it's a -- it's a hard time right now.
R:  Oh yes, yes.
L:  But um -- you know, it's funny, because the people -- everybody that I know that has had travel plans or, you know, they haven't really changed the amount of -- amount that they're flying.
R:  Oh.
L:  So I don't know if it's just --
R:  Well I -- I -- I was speaking to like, friends and members that, you know, they -- I can tell that they're hesitating on traveling because of -- because of the terror- -- t- -- terrorism that's going on lately.
L:  Oh.
R:  They've told me, well I'm -- I don't want to travel, you know, I guess there's a type of fear.
L:  Uh-huh.  So 
R:  Personally, I would be afraid. [LAUGH] 
L:  Is that right?
R:  Terrible.  Because it's just too -- there's just so much going on now with, ah, Middle East -- Eastern situation.
L:  Well, I mean, I wouldn't want to travel to the Middle East.
R:  No, no, but I mean they're -- they're um, the terrorist attacks are happening in the US, so 
L:  That's right, that's right.  But you know, I figure that the percentage of it happening in any particular plane that I'm going to be on is very low, so I -- I don't let --
R:  Very low for what?
L:  --very low for happening to whatever plane I'm on.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So I fig- -- you know, it's, I mean, you know, there -- there is a chance anything can happen when you travel anyway, so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, I -- I don't know, I don't -- I -- we -- we haven't let it stop us from what --
R:  Well, I -- I guess you shouldn't but I -- personally I guess I'm a little bit more, I don't know, hesitant.
L:  Well you know, I have to admit, because we went to -- we flew fr- -- to um, London a year ago, and I have to admit when I was waiting in the little area, you know, you wait in before you go on the plane --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I was really looking at all of the other passengers. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh yes.
L:  -- you know, and I was a lot more aware um, of what type of people were on the plane.
R:  Right.
L:  But um, but it didn't keep us from going. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well I -- I still think, I mean, I still think, um, the heightened security, it does help.
L:  I think it does.  I really do.
R:  I -- I think it's -- I don't know if it helps in -- in like, hindering, like, the -- the terrorists.  Does that -- that -- that make them wary?  You know? [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Well, I think --
R:  Do they say, wait a minute, there's extra precautions going on, should we be more cautious, so ?
L:  Uh-huh.  I think it does.
R:  Yeah?
L:  I do.
R:  Okay.
L:  I do.  I mean, at least --
R:  I don't know how a terrorist thinks, so [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I mean --
R:  I don't know if that scares them or not or if they just say, who cares, we'll still do it, you know?
L:  Well that may be, but I mean, I know that their ultimate goal is to harm as many people as possible --
R:  Right, right.  So I'm not sure if they -- they -- if it hinders them though. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, you don't think so?
R:  I don- -- I -- I would -- I don't think so. [LAUGH] I don't think so.
L:  Oh, well I think it makes them [COUGH] it either directs them in another direction, in other words, with heightened security at the airport --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- maybe they decide, okay, well that's not the way to do it on an airplane, maybe find some other way to do it.
R:  Oh, okay, oh yeah, that -- that -- that could be an avenue for people. [LAUGH] Decide you go with another avenue.
L:  Yeah, I don't think it'll -- yeah, I don't think it'll keep them from trying to do something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I just think it'll make them either --
R:  So you think -- you think that at the airport, thought, it will?
