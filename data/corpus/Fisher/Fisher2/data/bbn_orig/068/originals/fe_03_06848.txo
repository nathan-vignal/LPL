L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  My name is Tina and I'm [NOISE] from California. [NOISE]
R:  Hi Tina.  I -- I'm Gina [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- and I'm from Hawaii [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  How is it out there today?
R:  It's hot -- it's hot.  Very little breeze [LAUGH].
L:  Oh [LAUGH].  
R:  How --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- about California?
L:  Oh, it's beautiful.
R:  Oh, good.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Southern California?
L:  Southern California.
R:  Oh, good.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH] Well --
L:  Um, that topic.  I think I won't have any problems speaking about [LAUGH].
R:  Okay, go ahead! [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Okay, um.  [LIPSMACK] Well, um, [LIPSMACK] my husband travels for a living so, um, he was, ah, able to witness first hand the increase in security after nine eleven.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, er, um, -- I guess the question they're asking is that, um, do you feel more secure and I definitely say, "Yes" because of all the things that they've had him, [NOISE] um, do, like, um, for instance, take his shoes off [NOISE] and just, um, [NOISE] thinking -- they're doing things that I -- I wouldn't, you know, that most people wouldn't think of, you know, -- the layperson wouldn't think of checking or being a hazard.
R:  Ahah.
L:  So, um, [NOISE] I'd have to say, "Yes" [NOISE].  I've flown once this year and I was very impressed by the security --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, er ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [PAUSE] [NOISE] 
R:  Well [LAUGH].  I've -- I've flown a number of times [MN] actually -- at least twice a year --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- since that's happened.
L:  Mm.
R:  I just came back from, er, -- t- -- actually, I was in Southern California in March and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I'm, um   [LIPSMACK] I think --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that if a person --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is intent to commit --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- mayhem, there are ways they can do that that defy any -- any kind of searches.  I [SIGH] --
L:  That's true [NOISE]
R:  -- I just [SIGH].  You know, even --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- myself, I'm not a violent person.  But, um, I could use a pencil, or a pen a- -- as a lethal weapon.  You can use ceramic, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- edges --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that -- that would not show --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- up on any --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- kind of, um, [LIPSMACK] er --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- xray device --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or wouldn't set off any metal detectors.  There are just so many things that could be done that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- cannot be found and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I -- I have been very annoyed --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- by, um, [LIPSMACK] some of this stuff.  They -- they were taking little babies, little two --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- year olds aside because they had, um.  Like, I just heard it -- about it again today.  A little two year old was taken away from her mother --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and father.  Taken away from them --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and searched.
L:  Really? Oh ...
R:  Because her father was Indian.  Now, I know [MN] that people who are bent on terror would do anything.  They'd --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- even use children.  They do use children --
L:  [NOISE] Mm.
R:  -- in the Middle East -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  to blow people up.  You know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's -- it's a terrible thing, um, but I think, you know, that kind of business is nonsense.  It's, um, -- what's happening is, I think, we're not using our common sense.
L:  Right.
R:  And they -- they say --
L:  Well where --
R:  -- profiling [PAUSE] --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- pro -- pro --
L:  -- I'm sorry.  I'll let you finish.
R:  Huh.  Profiling people, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is -- is not what we should be doing.  I think that's utter nonsense --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean, people aren't coming from Sweden --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [LAUGH] and blowing us up, [SIGH] um.  We need to be smart about this, and, I -- I think we're not being smart.  I think we're using the shotgun method of -- of hitting everything and not really taking care of business.
L:  Right.  And --
R:  So.  I'm -- I'm glad that we're, [LIPSMACK] er, more [inaudible].  I mean, we've been such an open society it's -- it's amazing we haven't had more --
L:  Mhm [NOISE].
R:  -- awful things happen.  But, the way they're doing airport security.  I don't believe is, um, really getting the job done and I don't think we need to slow things down anymore.  I think we need to get smarter about what we're doing and have more high-tech stuff happening.  You know, body scanners that you walk through, that kind of stuff [PAUSE].  Um, 'cause I -- I think what it does is just make people --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- mad.  It certainly has wrecked our economy and the travel industry and in Hawaii its really hurt us.  Big time!
L:  Mhm, right.
R:  'Cause people --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- don't wanna travel --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they don't wanna stand in those long lines and -- and get harassed, and -- and sometimes its really not very pleasant.  The people --
L:  And -- and --
R:  -- who
L:  -- and they probably are not gonna try the same thing anyway.  And we're focusing too much --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- on -- on one aspect --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of terrorism.
R:  Yeah.  I think so.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I think having a heightened alert, you know.  All -- all the people in the country be more aware of what's around them and being [SIGH] -- we keep less to ourselves and be more snoopy [LAUGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know.  More --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- interested in our neighbors and have that be okay and be a positive thing.  That, er, that's where it's likely to be, um, taken care of.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And also, when people come into the country, you know, we need to be smarter about that.  There are so many loopholes, er, for people entering the country illegally, that, er --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- er.  And the documents they can get, you know.  Our scanners, and all of our airports and all of our borders should be more high tech --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that work.  Unfortunately, they come up with these high tech ideas and half the time don't train the people who are using them.  They don't have enough personnel that are trained, er, to make it a -- a job that's, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- reasonable, and not drudge.  I mean, can you imagine being an airport inspector, standing eight hours a day just, you know, shuffling grumpy people [LAUGH] through the -- through all that?  I -- I just think that's one of the worst jobs around.
L:  [NOISE] I agree
R:  I don't know what the answer is but I don't think the kind of tightening that we're doing [MN] -- I --, you know.  In terms of the garden variety bad guy, yeah, I guess --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I feel safer but somebody who's intent on hurting us, no, I don't --
L:  Mm, right.
R:  -- think we've gotten there.
L:  They -- they, um, [NOISE] --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- put a lot more into it and then didn't just, you know, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- your -- like you said, you're an everyday person --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- everyday bad guy, but, er ... [NOISE].
R:  Yeah.  So, I [NOISE] -- I don't know what the answer is, but I -- I don't a- -- I don't appreciate losing my freedom and we have.  We've lost a lot of freedom --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in our travel --
L:  That is so true.
R:  -- Um, and I ...  [MN] They've won! [LAUGH].  The terrorists have won by changing our --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- style of living.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that's not good, so ...  I think we just need to be smarter in how we're doing this and not -- not more --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- restrictive.  But, you know, I'm -- I'm at, um, -- I work with college students and we have a lot of international --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- students, and they're certainly, you know, on the other end at -- at the, um, [LIPSMACK] at the embassies.  I was told by one consulate worker who does visas, student visas --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- she [COUGH] she spends an average, she said, of thirty seconds with each interviewee --
L:  No!
R:  -- thirty seconds!
L:  Oh!
R:  And she said, at the most, if there's any red flag, maybe three minutes.  You know, how can you -- how can you evaluate a person in that period of time?
L:  No.  You can't!
R:  No.  Of course not.  And -- and they can, you know, they have to have enough monetary support, er, for them, from their home country, um   Families all can put their money in one bank account and show they had the monetary support and then when everything's done --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they take the [LAUGH] money back where it's supposed to be.  So, you know, people find a way around, um, -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the minutia that we've set up.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  We need to -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, to do things more intelligently.  And I don't know what that means, I guess [LAUGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but -- [SIGH] but, most of the students who come, by far, ninety nine point nine per cent of them are students --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and it's a very good thing, internationally --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for us to do that because, ah, they go home having been educated in America and most of them have a good experience here and they're good ambassadors for us.  And many of them become leaders in their home countries and they remember that positive connectedness.  Sure, some of them aren't.  I -- I remember hearing about the -- the leaders in Ir- -- Iraq just recently.  How many of them got engineering degrees from America? [PAUSE]  
L:  Mm.
R:  Did you hear that?
L:  [LIPSMACK] No.  No.
R:  But, um, perhaps we just need to do a good job of being friends with the people who come to visit us so that [SIGH] when they go home they have a positive connection.
L:  Right.  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, we sure do have a lot of enemies!
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.  And -- and that's not uncommon in third world.  [MN] It's easy to be jealous of people who have when you haven't. 
L:  Right.
R:  And with our movies, and our television, it looks like all of us are just filthy rich.
L:  Right.
R:  Have more money that we know [LAUGH] what to do with.
L:  Right.
R:  And that's not accurate.  But that's, um, that's what they see of America.  They don't know what its like -- people who live here get a better idea.  But, um, there are not that many who live here and then go home.  A lot of people who come wanna stay and they wanna stay because its so much freer here and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- have more opportunity than they do in their home countries.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, some people get real jealous of that, and they blame the haves because they are have nots.  I think that's what's happening in the Middle East.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They're -- instead of looking at what they can do to make their lives better, they spend their energy being jealous of people who have what they don't.  Instead of making the changes that are necessary to have.
L:  Right.  Right.  And they -- and they need to try to work harder [MN] there, but they -- they don't want to do that. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Oh.  It's really a -- a jealousy thing.  And that's a har- -- that's hard to overcome.  It's even hard to address because people don't want to acknowledge that they're jealous.
L:  That's right!  [NOISE].  Like racism and all these other topics that people don't wanna talk about.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
