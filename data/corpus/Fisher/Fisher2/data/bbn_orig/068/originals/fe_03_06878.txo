R:  Ah, Dorethea.
L:  Amanda.  Are you there?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Sorry, I've never done one of these before.
R:  Okay, I haven't either.
L:  Oh goodness.  All right, um, well from my guestimation we're supposed to discuss airport security and if we think --
R:  Okay, we're supposed to discuss what?
L:  Airport security and whether or not we think stricter guidelines are actually going to keep terrorists out.
R:  Ah, I don't think so, because, ah, I feel like if anybody, you know, wants to do something they got a million ways to slip something in without anybody knowing it, you know.  And so it's good for them to um -- to um, boost the ah -- the ah, security and everything but I still think we're still not safe enough, you know, because like I said, you know, if they want to bring something in they can.  It don't have to be a bomb or a gun, it could be something real small and deadly, you know, and they still not having any type of idea, you know that they're bringing this stuff in.
L:  I agree with you completely.  It scares me, the amount of stuff that you can conceal.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And even with them making you take your shoes off at the airport, still it's not going to get everything.  I mean, there are certain things that can be hidden.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Because like I said, they can carry this in their pocket and they don't even know because the ah, the ma- -- the machine, or whatever they got detecting things, through your ah, your suitcase --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, like I said, this thing might -- can not even be detected by the, ah, by the machine, you know.  And so I just think that we're still not safe. [LAUGH] So they can, you know, like I said, it's good for them to up boost the, ah, security and everything to let them know that we are watching them, you know, and everything, but I just feel like we're still not safe.
L:  I think you hit on a really good point there.  I think the security check points are mainly for show.  I agree with you.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's, um, people standing round trying to look official [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when the reality is, I mean, right after nine eleven how many people went through security just because they could, to see if they could --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with guns, knives --
R:  Right.
L:  -- even an ice pick, for goodness sake.
R:  Right --
L:  You know.
R:  -- because we've let them know that we is watching them, so they're just giving them the, ah, the more chances to think of something else to slip in here, without the machine detecting they're bringing this stuff in, you know.
L:  I agree.
R:  And so we're just giving them all our information [LAUGH] out, so 
L:  It -- it's curious, I mean j- -- just one random thing that I was thinking about as soon as we started talking about this --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I used to work in a hospital --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and there are certain kinds of medical equipment, that if it were to be left in a body would not be x-ray detectable.
R:  Right.
L:  There you go.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Or even better, you could wrap something that is x-ray detectable into a sponge that is not x-ray detectable and therefore sneak it in.
R:  Right.
L:  See, it's all MacGyver.  I mean, come on [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- it's the same junk that's been happening for decades.
R:  I know, that's true. [LAUGH] And so, you know, I think everything gets slacked off because they're not getting the, ah -- the, ah, the travel like they, you know, usually do on the airplane and, ah, on the busses either so I think everybody's just afraid.  I think now, these days, everybody's just going to take a chance just driving in their truck and cars to make it to their destination wherever they want to go, you know.  Because like I said, they feel like they're still not safe enough.  So why should you think that --
L:  Hello?  Hello?  Okay.
R:  Nigger.
L:  Hello?
R:  Oh okay.  I thought I had cut you off.
L:  I didn't know what happened.  I was --
R:  Me neither.  So I still feel like, the people feel like they're not safe enough, you know, even though they've up boosted the security I think they feel like it is best for them to travel in their cars and trucks, you know --
L:  And that --
R:  -- wherever they're going to.
L:  -- that -- that's an oxymoron on two levels.  First off, I mean I agree with you completely but I think on the American people's part --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's an oxymoron because first off, air travel, regardless of terrorists is, like, twenty times safer than traveling by your vehicle.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And second off, we're fighting over oil --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- which in turn makes gasoline --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so either way we look at it, unless we're on foot or on, like, one of those electric cars [LAUGH] or um, solar cars, whatever --
R:  Right.
L:  -- we're -- we're still using -- we're still using the vice that they've got around our throats --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know.  I mean America uses, like, ninety percent of the world's oil and we only produce twenty percent of it.
R:  Right.
L:  So i- -- they've got us one way or the other. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, because it's just, ah, making everything expensive [inaudible] well higher, and because like, the jobs and stuff, it's getting scarce, you know, you can't hardly find a job these days and so we don't even know what we're going to do on that, you know.
L:  I agree.  I agree.
R:  And so everything is just hard.  We just have to take one day at a time, you know, and see what's going to come up.  And so, I mean, everything is wo- -- is -- is worst -- you know, worse.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I'm concerned, um, if they're ever going to get around to having another one of the energy crises.
R:  It feels like we're going through one now.
L:  Well yeah, but they haven't actually declared it like they did.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, I mean, and it was before I was born but I still, you know, research blahdyy blahdy blahdy blah school and stuff like that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, it -- it kills me that in America every what, eight to twelve years, there's a war.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Every eight to twelve there's terrorist attacks, like, escalating.  Every eight to twelve years there's an energy crises.
R:  Mhm.
L:  The government does it as a fundraiser --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they always have, they always will, until we wise up and stop using the same kind of stuff --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- until we stop falling for the same crap --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, as far as airport security, I -- I honestly can't -- I don't know that there's ever going to be enough airport security.
R:  I don't think so either.
L:  Because you could take something off the plane.  I mean, I've been on a plane twice in my entire life, but I can guarantee there's something on that plane is sharp or blunt enough to be used as instrument.
R:  Mhm.  Because it don't have to be somebody from over -- overseas or something like that, they've got many ways -- they can pay somebody all -- over here in the US and they can go for -- you know, and just take the money, and you know, they can bring stuff on the, ah, on the airplane.  It don't have to necessarily be somebody overseas to do this.  They could pay somebody, you know, on the airplane like the, ah, the people who fly the airplane.  You know, they could bring something on there.
L:  Exactly.  I mean, look at your cheesy, bad airplane movie --
R:  Right.
L:  -- who -- who is it that's really -- who is that's really involved?  
R:  Right.
L:  There's like, somebody that's on the plane and there's somebody that works on the plane, or for the company --
R:  Right.  But who can you trust?  You can not trust anybody these days.
L:  No.  No. [LAUGH] You can't.  And that's just the thing.  I mean, I don't know that I will get back on a plane in the next five years --
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know. [LAUGH] 
R:  I have never been on one so I am afraid of flying. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, I'm definitely scared of 'em.  I -- I went on it once, I went up to Washington and came back --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and just, I mean, definitely scared --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because between the terrorists and between, I mean, I don't -- I don't know if you remember all this or not --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but um, late seventies, early eighties there was all kinds of plane crashes, lost planes --
R:  Oh yeah, I remember that.  Ooh, that scares me so bad.
L:  -- yeah, and -- and I just -- not only that but there was the -- the stuff where all the, um, the double decker um, highways in New York and California and the triple deckers were collapsing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it was just all kinds of stuff that was going on all at once --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and that's the kind of stuff that goes through my head when I'm sitting at the airport waiting in the little area after my bags have been checked --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- where I'm still able to buy stuff. [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, that's the kind of stuff that goes into my head and I'm like, oh no --
R:  Mhm.  Because I -- I keep hearing on the news, you know, when the people go to the airport and everything, their bag has to be checked by security and everything and they say how long it takes them to do that, you know, that's kind of getting on people's nerves too, but you know, they still think it's a good idea for them to do it but it's just taking, you know, that much longer for them to get on the airplane be- -- you know, because of that and everything.  But like I said, you can pay -- if anybody wants the money you know, they're going to go for it if it's the right price and everything.  Oh, they can slip anything on the airplane, you know.
L:  I agree, not just -- not just the right -- the right price but the right cause too.
R:  Right.
L:  Because, I mean, terrorists, we have more -- we have more terrorists in the United States among US citizens --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- than we have enemies from abroad, honestly --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I mean, look at all the fundamentalist groups, and I'm not saying everybody doesn't have a right --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but come on --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- how many nationalities do we have here?  And how many nationalities --
R:  Oh, a lot.
L:  -- resort to violence?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, every single one at some point does.  Ev- -- every group
