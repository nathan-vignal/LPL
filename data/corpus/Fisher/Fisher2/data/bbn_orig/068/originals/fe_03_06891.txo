L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.  Hi, my name is Liz.
L:  Liz?  Hi, I'm Leena.
R:  How are you this evening?
L:  I'm okay, I'm okay.  How are you?
R:  Not too bad.  Putting up curtains, actually. [LAUGH] 
L:  You're what?
R:  I was hanging up curtains, actually.
L:  Oh.  Are you from the East Coast?
R:  Actually, I'm ah, in Minnesota.
L:  Oh, okay.  Okay.  I'm here in California.  It's, like, three o'clock right now.
R:  Oh gosh. [LAUGH] 
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Okay, so, um, the Middle East.  Are you into politics?
R:  Um, actually, yes I am.  Um, and ah, my husband was in the milit- -- well, I met my husband -- we were both um, in the military, we were Russian translators --
L:  Oh wow.
R:  -- um, and we were cross trained into Serbo Croatian --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and because ah, the whole Bosnia thing is -- is so near to the Middle East and because there was a lot of fear when we were still in, that we would be cross trained again into Arabic --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- we have kind of kept up with it.  Luckily we're both out at this point --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- but we do try and, yeah, keep up with it.
L:  Oh, okay.  So um, yeah, do you think US should still be involved in the ?
R:  You know, it's such a toss up, you know.  I -- I -- I agree that something needed to be done, but it should have been done a long time ago.  And for them to still be there, it's going to have to end up with something like what we've got in -- in Korea.  And what we've got now in Bosnia with the DMZ, you know, you need to have a demilitarized zone to kind of keep everybody apart and it's just not going to happen any time soon.
L:  Yeah.  So you're a Russian?
R:  Um, I -- we had learned Russian and Serbo Croatian.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So 
L:  Um, I don't -- yeah, I don't know too much about what's going on right now, but yeah, sometimes -- sometimes people accuse US of trying to, like, play like, the like, father figure for the whole world.
R:  World police.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, world police, that's true.  But um, I mean, I guess I don't know, sometimes we might just be kind of interfering with their business.  But we have, like, the power to like, help people out.  I guess we have a responsibility to do that.  I'm not sure.
R:  It -- it -- it's a tough one, because you have the moral issues too --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's something, you know, it should have been done, I mean the -- the -- even, you know, if you look at, you know, our situation now, our involvement with um, you know, with Iraq and Iran and even what's happening in, you know, Israel and whatnot something really should be done, but if we're going to do something, I almost say that we need to go in and finish it because at this point things are going back and forth and -- and I think that if um, you know, we had, you know, if Bush had come out and said, "Here's my platform.  It is about the oil, and -- and we're -- as a bo- -- you know, as a bonus we're going to be taking care of, you know, this, and these are contingency plans that we have set up in place", it probably would have gone a lot smoother --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because they didn't know what the hell they were doing, [LAUGH] you know.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Um --
R:  We've got a lot of friends that are over there right now and the emails that we get from, of course everything is, you know, scrubbed clean of any real information, but you know, the information that we're getting from them is just like, you know, we don't know what we're doing.  We're sitting here and -- and we're supposed to be helping these people and we can't do this and we can't do this, but we have to do this, and this doesn't make sense and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they just didn't, you know, they kind of went in and didn't really know how to clean it up.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mm, see, I wish I knew all about politics but um, yeah, I don't know.  I -- I was kind of torn, you know, when, like, the whole war broke out and everything --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like, I'm from UCLA, and like, there's been so many protests here, and like, like, activity like that, and I don't know, I've always just been kind of like, torn between like, that, and like, or some people say like, Bush, yeah, he -- he doesn't know what he's doing, you know, he says he's going in to help people or whatever, but he's actually not, and like, a lot of people were saying um, they should just kind of like, be left alone to just kind of work things out on their own terms, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they're not really doing that, so I guess we kind of have to like, to -- to kind of jump in and try to straighten things out, but, yeah, it doesn't seem like we're doing much.
R:  No.  They -- they jumped in and they, you know, messed everything up but there's not -- the problem being, I think, is that from a historical sense you have to look at it with um, with -- with how it's going to um, affect any liaisons and -- and ah, you know, agreements or arrangements that countries have between each other.  I mean, that's exactly how we got into one of the world wars, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, you know, some -- you know, prime minister was killed and, you know, so they called on Italy and Italy called on blah blah and then somebody else called on their friends, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and that's why you had a world war, you know.  It -- it -- y- -- you have to look at who's buddies with whom and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- how it's going to affect everything, and I don't think that anybody really thought about that.
L:  Yeah.  Where exactly is the situation right now in Iraq, anyway?
R:  Um, right now, what it's coming down to, you know, there's -- right now they're kind of in a holding pattern.  They're trying to maintain what they've got, um, trying to hold -- from what I understand there's not a whole lot -- they've been encountering pockets of resistance but they're few and far between and it is usually found on their -- on their sweeps, you know, when they go out beyond what we've seen on TV.  You know, when they go out into the smaller areas and -- and there'll be a few pockets of resistance, but not really, and um, from what I understand right now they're just trying to hold everything that they've got.  They're trying to put in some um, form of government, ah, and -- and try -- you know, what we've been told is that they're trying to have a self government, you know, so that people that actually live there are in charge there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, but I don't know how that's, you know, what's coming out right now and -- and even from some of the soldiers that I've been hearing that a lot of the information that we had been, you know, basing decisions on --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- was not necessarily falsified, but exaggerated.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  Which is really unfortunate.  You know, the whole, you know, weapons of mass destruction thing.  I swear to God if I hear W.M.D. one more time, I'm going to go nuts!  But ah, shock and awe!  Shock and awe! [LAUGH] But it just seems like a lot of it was, you know, stretched a little bit so that it sounded better.
L:  Yeah, propaganda and all that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, are you anti war?
R:  Um, you know, there are -- there's -- there's times and places for everything.  I mean, I -- I can't say that I'm anti war, simply because a lot of my f- -- ah, that's tough.  You know, I'm not anti soldier by any means, um, a lot of my friends are out there.  Anti war is -- is really difficult, I mean, if somebody came into my house and started shooting me and my family and messing up my town, then, you know --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- there'd be something that I'd have to do.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I -- I don't know.  I think that, at least it -- I don't know.  It -- it's very difficult.  I don't like the whole idea of, you know, civilians being killed and -- and of course, there's always that happening in -- in a war z- -- you know, zone, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- hm.  I don't know.  That's tough.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I was kind of anti war in the beginning, but I don't know, I'm more like, neutral now --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I just kind of leave it up to our leaders, because --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I'm sure there's like, so many things, like, our -- like, our media is so, like, corrupt and so I don't know what they show us, so I'm thinking, okay, most of us, like, I thought like, most of the people that are protesting against the war, like, they don't really know everything.  They're just kind of like, judging their fact -- their, like, opinions on like, very slim information, just like here and there what they're hearing and they say that it's all wrong.  But I don't know, I think -- sometimes it's like, very necessary.  I don't -- I don't know that this last war was very necessary.  I don't know, but 
R:  Yeah, I'd have to agree with that.  It kind of seems like a war of convenience almost.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, it probably was somewhat.
R:  It -- it is a difficult thing to decide.  I just don't -- and it's too bad, you know, 'cause I kind of wonder now what, ah, what brought it -- you know what I mean, why all of a sudden this was going to happen and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and unfortunately there's been a lot of rumors of, you know, this being, in -- you know, planned in place for -- for many years before it actually happened and that's just unfortunate.
L:  Yeah.
R:  All I know is I didn't vote for him, so [LAUGH] [several inaudible words]
L:  Are you a Democrat?
R:  Um, basically an Independent.
L:  Oh, I see.  I see.  Yeah, um, wh- -- I haven't voted yet.  I just -- I'm nineteen, so I haven't really gotten a chance to vote yet but I should, I think.
R:  [LAUGH] And it will be soon, and look, the whole state of the demo -- -- you know, the whole democracy is on your shoulders now.
L:  Yeah.  I see that.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's kind of scary, like, I mean, like, um, there's not that many people our age, my age, like, very involved in politics and stuff.
R:  You know, and that -- and that really is the truth, which is, you know, is very unfortunate too, um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I mean, I'm not, that much, I think I'm, you know, maybe about ten years older than you are, you're nineteen?
L:  Nineteen, yeah.
R:  Nineteen.  And you know, the only reason that I was very involved in politics was because at the time that I was nineteen I was in the military, so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you know, who I voted for was really dependent on who had the best military plan and that's kind of how we're still going.  It's, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- just because the military is a very inconvenient
