R:  Hell- --
L:  Hello --
R:  -- Hi.
L:  Hi!
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  I'm fine.
R:  [SIGH].
L:  I'm Julie.
R:  I'm Pam.
L:  -- and, er, in Longleaf, Texas.
R:  Oh, I'm in Pennsylvania.
L:  Ah!
R:  [LAUGH].  Ah, they said the question quickly.  Did you hear what it was?  It said, "Do we --"
L:  And did --
R:  "-- think that --"
L:  -- airport security reduces --
R:  -- r- -- okay.
L:  -- spread of air -- terrorism, I think was the way she put it.
R:  Okay, um  [NOISE] 
L:  What do you think?
R:  I -- I do to some degree [LAUGH].  You -- you hear a lot of stories about things that are getting through anyway, um, [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] but I -- I have noticed a lot more security, so I do think it reduces.  I don't know that it would completely prevent --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [LAUGH] it.  
L:  [SIGH].  Yeah.  I don't think it would prev- -- completely prevent it.  And, er, I don't -- I think that would be nearly impossible, I think terrorists --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- could -- can change the way they do things --
R:  Right.
L:  -- enough to keep ahead of security.  I think security's always one step behind.
R:  Right.
L:  But, yeah, they do.  They took, er, um, [LIPSMACK] a -- what did I have?  A little pair of scissors --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or something once --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I just wasn't even thinking about, you know, like cuticle scissors, or something.  But, um, that's the only problem I personally have had --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when I've gone through in the last couple of years.
R:  Ah.  I'm trying to think if, -- er, early on before they started checking serious, do you remember when the one guy had something in his shoes and they really started checking after that?  My -- my husband had -- they had him take off his shoes, which was like before they really started doing that seriously. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, but I haven't -- I think that was randomly searched[?] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like, to go through my bag at one point but they didn't find anything, but, I did see them take cuticle scissors from somebody.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Bu-.--
L:  But my mum, ah, was coming back from Europe, um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- on nine eleven, and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they, um, took the plane and they went -- landed in Halifax, and, um, when they left Halifax a couple of days later to come back in the United States they took a, er, course she, you know, when she'd left it was fine to take it, you know, and then --
R:  Right, right.
L:  [NOISE] -- all of a sudden there was increased security after nine eleven.  [SIGH] Um, they took a small knife that had belonged to my father --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- who died back in eighty five so it has sentimental value --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- to her.  So things like that happened too --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know?
R:  Well, I guess now sh- she would --
L:  Yeah.  Now you'd have enough --
R:  -- know, or you would know --
L:  -- sense not to take it.
R:  -- not to bring it.  Right!
L:  But, um, yeah, they took away a -- a --
R:  Ah, that's a shame!
L:  -- small knife.  But as it turned out the Red Cross lady did mail it back to her.
R:  Aw, that's nice!
L:  So, yeah, that was nice.  But, um, I -- I don't -- I don't mind the security myself but, you know, you keep hearing these horror stories about, oh, people who, [MN] um, [LIPSMACK] have things implanted and, you know, they make them strip, and -- and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, there's a lot of things going on that -- that, where they're not very sensitive --
R:  [NOISE] Right.  
L:  -- to people's disabilities.
R:  Yeah.  I haven't really heard anything like that to be honest.
L:  Well, once in a while, you know, there's something that makes people mad enough, you know, where they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- contact the news, and, you know --
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  -- it'll be on -- it'll be on the news, you know.  Where -- where, you know, somebody's -- with their little old lady mother and, you know, the poor little old lady mother has to strip --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, y- you know, is treated like a common criminal.
R:  Right.  I --
L:  So, I --
R:  -- guess --
L:  -- think they need to be more sensitive --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, you know --
R:  Yeah.  I guess --
L:  -- to people's --
R:  -- it would be hard --
L:  disabilities --
R:  -- for them to -- 
L:  -- and, to age and --
R:  -- separate where they --
L:  -- and that kind of thing.
R:  -- draw the line, I guess.
L:  Yeah, uh, but, er, no, it -- it hasn't slowed me down any.  And [MN] --
R:  Yeah.  I -- I'm trying to think, we went somewhere, like, over a holiday weekend or some -- some like more major day where they seem to be a lot stricter and we noticed it a lot more.  It seems to be a little inconsistent, depending on when you fly.
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true too.  [SIGH]  I -- Wh- -- what I'd like to see is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for them to have some kind of, um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- system where they okay you beforehand --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so you have some kind of, er, you know, I don't even care if its your fingerprint or your retina or, you know, --
R:  Right!
L:  -- something like that.  Where, you know, you can go through in a hurry --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because you've already been checked out beforehand and -- and, you know, [MN] joined whatever --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know and said, "Yeah, you can have my fingerprint" --
R:  It seems to be more the -- like them going through the bags though and the xrays of the bags that seems to be holding it up to me.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Although --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- we -- we usually check our bags outside and we don't see them looking in the bags from outside.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- you would think maybe they are doing that behind the scenes --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, ...
L:  [SIGH] I -- I don't -- I haven't flown since they started doing the checking of the -- of check through bags.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I haven't flown since -- last, -- gosh, the last time I flew was last August.
R:  Right.
L:  I haven't been anywhere recently, so, er, [MN] you know, I haven't been slowed down.  You know, as far as checking bags in, or anything.  But, um, y- you know, I -- I think it's just a matter of, [MN] you know, so many people feel like we- -- were losing our -- all our privacy.
R:  [LIPSMACK] I agree, --
L:  You know, and that's what --
R:  -- but I --
L:  -- makes America, America.
R:  Yeah.  I agree.  But I kinda feel like I'd rather be [LAUGH] inconvenienced to avoid a problem, it's better safe than sorry.  It does -- it does, I think, scare you more though.  The first time we flew, right after nine eleven, [SIGH] and, you know, you're seeing people around with guns and they -- you know, they were really --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- cracking down then.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  It -- I think it scared me more because it really reminded me [LAUGH] what -- what could potentially happen --
L:  Yeah, its, a --
R:  -- rather than making me feel safer.
L:  Yeah.  It's a very eerie feeling, to, you know -- I -- I know the -- the first time I saw guns was in Africa, you know, and I -- I remember being so startled, you know, and now we've got them here --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in the airport and it's just.  Yeah, it's kinda creepy --
R:  [NOISE] I --
L:  But --
R:  -- the last time I flew was January.  I mean, I -- [MN] like I said, the couple of times I've flown since then it has been a little inconsistent so I don't know if they're, you know, if they're -- they're still being as obvious about it or if they -- its just become a little bit more second nature.  My mother just flew this past weekend actually -- and she was really nervous because of -- of the holiday weekend --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they were, um, you know, it was code orange again and --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- I didn't get a chance to ask her whether she noticed any difference. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] But I --
L:  Wh- --
R:  -- think -- I think that they -- they tend to be stricter on holiday weekends, and that sort of thing when there's more likelihood that something --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- could possibly happen.
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's probably true.  But, er, I'm in a fairly small town so when I fly out of here, you know, there's one place to go through and, it --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, go through very quickly --
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  -- because there's only one plane on the -- on the, er, runway [LAUGH] at a time so, you know, there's not --
R:  So, you might not notice as --
L:  So --
R:  -- much of a difference. [NOISE]
L:  it -- you know, it's not bad here when I -- when I go to Dallas and fly out of Dallas, you know, I -- it's a little bit different, but ...  No, I -- I haven't been inconvenienced at all --
R:  [NOISE].  Yeah, we --
L:  -- I have to say.
R:  -- we fly out of Philadelphia so it's a pretty big airport.
L:  Out of where?
R:  Philadelphia.
L:  Say that again!
R:  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh, Philadelphia.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Philadelphia!  I'm sorry, with your accent, I -- I couldn't tell what you were saying.  Okay.  Yeah --
R:  so, that's a big airport --
L:  -- Well, that's a big airport --
R:  -- so you do.  You do notice it more. 
L:  But, would you [MN] -- would you consider yourself -- I was just doing reading the other day that, you know, the -- the -- with the last election, everything was -- was soccer moms.  And now they're saying its security moms.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That women are totally changing their politics because of security.  That's become more important to them any -- than anything else.
R:  What do you mean?
L:  So, they're becoming, instead of being liberal, they used to be -- usually the moms were pretty liberal, are now becoming a lot more, um, conservative.
R:  Oh.
L:  And it's all because of security.
R:  Huh.
L:  So, the democrats are -- are getting really worried because they're losing all the --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- soccer moms to, er, conservatism --
R:  Yeah, --
L:  -- because the --
R:  -- I can't really say that that's affected me.
L:  [SIGH] But, er, I -- I don't know.  I -- I just.  I'm just afraid they're taking it a little too far.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, when they can go in the libraries and see what you checked out and, er, I don't know. 
R:  I think -- I think what worries me is that I -- I mean, my feelings are sort of, if something else happens it's not gonna be the same thing again.  [SIGH] So you wonder if they're putting so much focus on what already happened --
L:  Exactly!
R:  -- and, not preventing --
L:  Exactly!
R:  -- you know, not looking somewhere else.
L:  Exactly!
R:  If they were smart, then, you know --
L:  It'll be something --
R:  -- they would try --
L:  -- in the water.
R:  -- something where we --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- want focusing.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I'm -- I'm thinking something in the water supply.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I -- I work in a chemical plant --
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  -- so, we're, er, you know, we're really under heightened security --
R:  Yeah, I'm sure.
L:  -- a -- a goodly --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- percentage of the time.
R:  So you do see that they're watching it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, that's -- that's good to know, at least. [LAUGH]
L:  But, um, I -- I don't know -- I don't know where it's all going.  Its --
R:  We can't be watching --
L:  -- er --
R:  -- everywhere, I mean.
L:  It's kind of a slippery [NOISE] slope --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know.  It's, er, I don't know.  Bush is just pushing this stuff through and pushing this stuff through and, you know, people aren't -- they wanna be secure so nobody's gonna stand up to him --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- and, I'm just afraid that, you know, we're gonna go a little too far.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But I'm pre- -- I'm pretty liberal, so ...
R:  I think people are getting accustomed to it though.  I mean, you -- you do.  You don't really think about it on a daily basis.  I don't anyway, anymore.
L:  No.  And I -- I live in a small enough town where I -- I'm not --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- concerned, you know.  It's always the, "It'll never happen to me" --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, that -- that people feel.  But I -- I've never had a bad experience on a plane where I feel uncomfortable, like, you know, there was people I need to be watching or anything. 
R:  No.
L:  But, um, what do -- do you think that the -- the pilot should carry guns and have --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yes[?].
L:  -- the cockpit door locked and all that?
R:  I don- -- I don't know!  Um, [SIGH] I don't know.  That sounds a little bit scary.  I mean, it'll never -- unless they were really properly trained how to handle them.  I guess keeping the cockpit door locked would seem like a smart idea, but --
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I'm -- I'm for that.  Yeah.  The guns --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I -- I don't know.  I think, you know, there could be a potential for --
R:  Just --
L:  -- [NOISE] disaster there.
R:  -- more potential for something to happen that -- accidentally [LAUGH] or 
L:  But, yeah, I -- I do -- I do think the --
R:  I mean, you hear --
L:  -- cockpit door should be secure.
R:  -- the stories about, you know, people that -- people that weren't terrorists saying something, you know, that they took their [inaudible], or something --
L:  Exactly! [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean, you wouldn't want somebody to get shot that --
L:  E- 
R:  -- you kn-
