L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  This is Judy.
L:  Ah, this is Ellie.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] This -- yes 
L:  I've never done this before, so 
R:  And neither have I.
L:  Okay. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, well we're starting off very well.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH] Ah, okay, they want us to talk about the Middle East.
L:  Yes.  For ten minutes, okay.
R:  Ten whole minutes, okay, that's a long time.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, it is.
R:  Ah, I -- I think we have to be involved, however I don't know that there will ever be any [several inaudible words]
L:  I agree.  Um, yeah, it seems like we need to kind of help some people out but, and -- are we supposed to talk about the peace process?  Right?
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  Involved in the peace process.  Yeah, I mean, I don't think we can just go in there and bomb everything and then get out.
R:  Well, it won't do any good.  I think that the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they're -- the -- the tensions and the, ah, hatred is -- is so deep --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, even between different, ah, Muslim sects --
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  -- as well as between, you know, the -- the Arabs and the Jews --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's just all -- and there's a lot of [inaudible] there's a whole bunch of [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's not very -- that's not very well spoken of me, but --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I [LAUGH] I think that it's such a -- a deeply rooted, um, problem that it's just not the kind of a thing that -- that is going to be solved.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, I don't think it'll ever be solved.  It --
R:  No.
L:  -- you know, it says in the bible that there will be fighting over there, so I think it's just gonna happen.
R:  Mhm, well, you know -- yeah, I mean [LAUGH] it has never changed.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, it has never changed and I think even if the Palestinians, ah, who have been exiled, if they -- if they have, ah, a homeland, you know, given to them or whatever, it's not going to make any difference.  They're still going to be attacking Israel --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and ah, you know, it's just -- and the rich countries are going to be ah, under attack from the poor countries --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- because a lot of this is -- is jealousy, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's very basic -- very basic.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, but since we've solved problems of the world I don't know how we can talk for another eight minutes. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I know, yeah.  That was easy. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that was no problem at all.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What -- do we just sit in silence for the next --
L:  I don't know [LAUGH] 
R:  I have no idea.  This is awful.  Um, this is a, you know, it's a topic that you hear about every day --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah, and -- and I think that a lot of people don't have any clue what -- what happens, why it happens --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or whatever, but a lot fewer people have any idea of what can be done.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  Ah, it's just -- it's just an awful thing and -- and we of course, are very involved because of the oil issue.
L:  Yeah.
R:  As well as because, you know, peace in the world --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and all that stuff --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but ah, I think that as long as we are so dependent on ah, Middle East --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for our fuel or so dependent on oil --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for, you know, as our basic fuel, ah, you know, if we all had electric cars we probably wouldn't care so much.
L:  [LAUGH] That's right.
R:  You know.  Yeah, it's ah, it -- it's just that everybody is so intertwined these days.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And ah, I -- I don't know.  I -- I don't think that we should shirk our commitment to Israel --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, but I -- I don't know what we can do to ah, to improve the situation in the Middle East.
L:  Yeah, I don't know --
R:  Or if we can.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I -- I just don't think it's -- it's in the cards.  I -- I don't know, ah, I don't know if we should be taking -- I guess we have to take sort of a -- a -- a leading role --
L:  Yeah, I think so.
R:  -- but I -- I just don't think that it's -- it's ah, very productive.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  I don't know.  But that -- that's it for me. [LAUGH] 
L:  I know. [LAUGH] I pretty much agree, so 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I know it -- it's, I don't know, it's -- it seems like we do have an obligation because we're the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, most civilized, I guess --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- country in the world or whatever [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah well --
L:  I don't know about civilized, but [LAUGH] 
R:  Well we're the most -- we're the most able to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to, you know, spread our, ah, our civility. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  You know what I mean.  It's -- there might be other -- I'm sure there are places that are just as civilized, except that --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you know, they don't have the wherewithal --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, and we do, and I think that with that power comes an obligation --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but ah, it -- it's just -- that is one -- one area that, I mean, since I was a kid and when I was a kid I wanted to be a -- I wanted to -- to join, um, the Foreign Service --
L:  Oh yeah?
R:  Yeah.  And ah, I wanted to be a diplomat --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I mean I wanted to -- to travel all over the world and I wanted to see all these places and learn and help these people and all this stuff, and [LAUGH] I was a very idealistic person --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- a kid, you know, and even then --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- even then, and that's I -- I wouldn't even want to tell you how long ago that was, ah, even then the problems there were terrible -- terrible --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the only thing then was that not so many of the Arab side had access to um, [LAUGH] you know, weapons and -- and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- bombs and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there was, I mean, whatever terror there was was ah, highly restricted --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to, you know, their own people or their next door neighbors --
L:  Right.
R:  -- rather than to the world --
L:  The whole world, yeah.
R:  -- yeah.  And you know, so it's -- everything is on a -- a much larger scope now and I think that means that the danger is worse.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  But I don't know what, I don't know how you -- you cannot change people's hearts.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, you really -- you just can't.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, and it's just ah, it's a very -- it's a very dangerous situation --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's a real dangerous situation --
L:  Yeah, it seems like it -- it is more serious now because of, you know, internet and travel is so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- prevalent and money kind of flows --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- money's there, and --
R:  -- exactly, and -- and I think that America was, I think United States should not have been but was really innocent of the possibilities --
L:  Yeah.  Yep.
R:  -- ah, you know, which made ah, nine eleven a possibility.
L:  Mhm.
R:  For example, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because it was like we were oblivious.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  It makes a big difference when there's a -- when there's death at your own doorstep, as opposed to, you know, half way around the world.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, but it's hard for people to keep a focus on that and to see a connection.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  You know --
L:  -- yeah, I -- I thought with -- after nine eleven, you know, that people would maybe be a little more sensitive to some of this stuff --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but it seems like they're not any more.  I mean, they were for a little while and then --
R:  Right.
L:  -- oh, everybody's back to the way, it seems like.
R:  Yeah.  I mean it's back in the background --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I think that's all -- that's just human nature.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, you're so busy worrying about your own little, ah, insular life, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah, and -- and of course it hasn't helped that, ah, the economy's been so bad.
L:  Yes. [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, because it doesn't [LAUGH] it doesn't y- -- it's very hard to be, you know, like, generous and -- and magnanimous --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- when you're worried about your job or you're worried about your bills or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, stuff like that.  I think that you know, if -- if -- if we were in better shape, then people would be less self absorbed, maybe.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  But it's ah, that's just a very, I don't know, I -- I just don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, I'm a -- I'm a -- a habitual observer. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But at the same time, I'm -- and I have never been able to come up with any kind of -- of answer or even direction.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, again, when I was a kid I used to think that education would solve everything --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that if you would just teach people about other people --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah, so that they could understand them --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and realize that they're really all -- that people really are all alike.  Um, I -- that that would -- that would solve all the problems with the world --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but of course, I -- I've [LAUGH] grown up now --
L:  [LAUGH] And you entered the real world. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, back into the real world and now you know, nothing helps so --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- um, I don't know.  Gee. [LAUGH] I don't know what to say now.
L:  Hm.  
R:  Uh-huh.  What else?  Let me see here.  Hold on.  Oh well, that's just
