L:  Okay. [NOISE] 
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, my name is Beth.
L:  Howdy, Beth, I'm Carey.
R:  Hi, [MN] how are you?
L:  Good.  How are you doing?
R:  Doing good.  [SIGH] -cept my family just decided to start the vacuum. [LAUGH] [COUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] To start what?
R:  [LAUGH] The vacuum. 
L:  The vacuum.
R:  [LAUGH] Okay, they just turned it off. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  Oh, professional athletes -- um.  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] I don't know where to start on that.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Are you a sports fan?
R:  [SIGH] Semi.  I'm a real big ACC --
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  -- basketball fan. [SIGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I don't watch a whole lot of football.  Um, but I will watch [SIGH] the Super Bowl sometimes if it's ah, an exciting game.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  If enough people are watching it.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE] I'm not really a sports fan myself.
R:  Mm. [LIPSMACK] But I really do think they're over paid. [SIGH]  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, that they [SIGH] live a life that [SIGH] most Americans and -- and people of the world just can never imagine or never even come close to. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I agree and I think that, like -- and other celebrities too but they're made celebrities when -- who says they're really role models at all?  [NOISE] Um, just because they make huge salaries doesn't mean that they have lives that we should all try to lead. [NOISE] 
R:  Right.  [COUGH] Well, in -- I live in Charlotte, North Carolina so we've had a lot of problems with our football team.  [LAUGH] Our local football [LAUGH] team --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the NB- -- um NFL [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and they're just not doing a good job influencing the kids of --
L:  Oh. 
R:  -- even of the city so I -- I --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- can't imagine what they're doing, you know. 
L:  What kind of problems?
R:  [SIGH] Oh, [COUGH] there have been all kinds of problems.  One guy, [MN] um, was accused of murdering his girlfriend --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- who was expecting his baby [SIGH] and another player, um, [LIPSMACK] w- was accused of, um, abusing his wife and then his wife got accused of killing him.  And it's just been -- it's just --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- been awful. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  That's pretty bad.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, that s- was a big thing in Philadelphia and one of the star players on the Seventy Sixers --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, he was [LIPSMACK] -- oh, what was in it?  S- -- there was this big thing over the summer about, um, his girlfriend and domestic dispute, and uh, like um, whether or not he beat her or not was the question, and she was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I think, suing him or something, and it's -- everyone automatically took his side.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And i- -- just like, to kind of a crazy extent.  They have like free high risk insurance or something and he wasn't even in jail --
R:  Uhuh.
L:  [LAUGH] -- and --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- um [MN] I forget what hap- -- they probably settled out of court or something.  I forget what happened with it.  I know he wasn't found guilty but it was just -- everyone automatically took his side [NOISE] and it's like --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- he's not even a good ro- -- role model if -- if you're hearing about things like that.
R:  Well -- -nd -- I've haven't kept up with the news much lately with them um -- apparently the topic is about them going on strike [SIGH] --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- um and [MN] I don't see how they could get any -- any more --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they're -- 
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- paid so high and I'm sure --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- all their health benefits and [SIGH] anything they could ever want or need --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- is covered --
L:  All taken care of.
R:  -- for life and, you know, [MN] they're living in houses and driving cars that [SIGH] I'll be lucky if I ever get to ride in [LAUGH] one --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- or go visit somebody that lives in one. [LAUGH] [NOISE]  So, I do not agree that -- that they should be on strike at all.
L:  Mhm.  I think right now it's baseball strikes, but I'm not sure.
R:  Okay.  Well, [MN] --
L:  Be football.
R:  -- here in Charlotte they're even trying to build a new arena 'cause we lost our um basketball team.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  They moved out 'cause they didn't like the facilities.  Well, we built a brand new coliseum for 'em about ten years ago --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- and that was state of the art then.  But of course, you know --
L:  Wasn't good enough. 
R:  -- it wasn't good enough, so they left town.  Now, they're trying to attract a new N- NBA team which we've got and now they wanna build a new arena at the -- at the co- -- at the price --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- of [SIGH] -- of taxpayers.  You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And we're -- we voted, "No" last year and the city's going to go ahead and go with it.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] So, ah --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it doesn't make any sense to me. [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  I think it is -- probably it's 'cause it's good -- good revenue for the city.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  But there is -- yeah, th- -- they -- we had the same stadium for football and baseball. --
R:  Mhm.
L:  They were converted, and they just moved -- they built -- they're closing that one down and I think it was pretty old.  And then [NOISE] they're building two separate ones --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and there's [NOISE] a lot of controversy about where to even put it.  Um, because [MN] everyone wanted one I think but nobody wanted it in their neighborhood because -- I dunno, crime involved and just where to put the actual structure. 
R:  And traffic and --
L:  Yeah, tr- -- oh, lots of traffic.
R:  -- all that stuff.  [LAUGH] And acquiring the land, you know.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  And of course, the city has to be taxed --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, to pay for it.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  And --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I dunno, um, I imagine up in Philadelphia like, you are already pla- paying enough tax.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We have a high city wage tax.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  City taxes.
R:  Mm.
L:  I don't know why couldn't they have just made [NOISE] -- I understand it was really old, build a new one, but why couldn't they have kept it just one for both things?  But, I don't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  All the stadiums are in the same area here and -- but nothing else is like around it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  There's just like, four stadiums.  Kinda cra- --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, you know they got to have their massage parlors you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in there and all their hot tubs --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and heat machines and all that and [SIGH] they don't want to have to leave the -- the stadium for nothing when they're there, I guess, for practices and --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- training and stuff so --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I don't know.  [NOISE] I just -- I hope somebody will tell 'em, you know, "This is life".  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Lump it or leave it. [LAUGH] 
L:  Reality check.
R:  Really. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm.  [SIGH] And the cost for the football games around here were just so extreme.  You had to buy like -- they called them TSLs and right now I can't think of what that stood for --
L:  [NOISE]  
R:  -- but you had your own seat -- you know, for the whole season --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and so um, they were selling for thousands of dollars -- 
L:  Oh --
R:  -- you know.
L:  -- they're season tickets probably.
R:  Pardon me?
L:  Probably season tickets.
R:  [SIGH] Well, yeah, but I mean you bought the seat in the stadium for --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- x number of years --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- you know.  So, I mean, um, I'm not sure if they even still had to buy tickets -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- of some sort on top of that, but I mean -- even just going in to see a game, you know, forty, fifty bucks --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for an afternoon.  That's just --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] it's not feasible for the --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- whole community.
L:  Because it's supposed to be -- I mean a -- like box --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- box office seats, whatever that -- those should be expensive but this is supposed to be for everyone.  I mean --
R:  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  -- if baseball's the national sport, then everybody should be able to afford it.
R:  That's right.
L:  And I remember going to games when I was a little kid and, um, the -- you know, they were a lot of fun and I just hope that ticket prices don't go up a lot because of the facilities and the athletes and the -- the huge costs involved that makes it such a big production.  I hope it doesn't make [NOISE] -- make it unaffordable to people.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But 
R:  Well.  Getting back to them being role models, I just don't think being money hungry and [SIGH] [LAUGH] --
L:  No. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- searching out for, you know, all these trinkets, that's just not, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's not what I grew up with as a role model.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't how old you are but [SIGH] I'm forty six and [SIGH] [MN] I felt lucky to go to the city ball games [LAUGH] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- where the city teams played.
L:  [NOISE] Who were your role models growing up?
R:  Um. [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Well, I really liked Carol Burnett.  I really wanted to grow up and be like her but I never made it.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I always thought she was funny. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But um. [SIGH] You know ev- --
L:  I never really -- I guess 'cause I'm not involved in sports, I never really looked at sports people one way or the other.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um.  I'm like twenty and [MN] -- I just never played sports.  I guess when I was a real little kid, like my -- my brother was -- he idolized like this just one baseball player.  I -- I pretended.  My whole family likes sports so I just pretended --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and went along with them and I never really understood that much. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, [NOISE] but I mean luckily the guy that -- that he really liked never did anything wrong but --
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I know there [NOISE] -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- there would have been a lot of explaining to do [NOISE] for my parents if he had [NOISE] and I guess th- -- that's what [NOISE] like little kids that grow up um -- and like just football players and basketball ga- -- players now, they kinda have to gamble because [MN] you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- what are they gonna think if they do something wrong?  Are they going to think they're cool?
R:  Oh yeah.  [SIGH] Well, [SIGH] the whole world is changed and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, I think looking at professional athletes and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- their life styles kinda indicates [SIGH] a little bit of where this world is coming to.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Hollywood actors too.  That's another --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- place I can get on my soapbox --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um.  They're all overpaid I believe.
L:  Yes.
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] 
L:  And they're all automatic role models.
R:  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  'Cause they're in the papers and --
L:  Mhm [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know.  [LIPSMACK] Us hard working blue collar people out here and -- you know, [SIGH] we don't mean much to some of these people but [LIPSMACK] hey, this is real life.  Mhm.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
