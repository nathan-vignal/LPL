R:  [NOISE] [NOISE] [NOISE] 
L:  Hello, this is Eileen.
R:  Hi, this is April.
L:  Hi April.  How are you?
R:  How are you?
L:  [LAUGH] Wonderful.
R:  [LAUGH] Good, good.  Um [LIPSMACK] so --
L:  And which state are you from? [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, I live um, actually in DC. [SIGH]
L:  Oh, you're in DC.  I'm in California.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, that's fine. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  They really hook up different -- different people.  I mean --
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.  Have you done this before? [NOISE] 
L:  Uh, you know, this is my second call --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, mine too.
L:  -- um, I had a call two days ago from a guy in New Jersey [SIGH] and I even asked him, "Have you gotten paid yet?" 'cause he said he was -- he was doing -- he had been on it for like three weeks --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- and he said "No". [LAUGH] 
R:  Really.
L:  I said, "Uh oh". [SIGH] 
R:  Now, that's interesting.
L:  Yeah.  And I thought you know, I didn't -- never -- I never -- uh -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- well, I guess you -- we could call and find out --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- how the pay is and what's going on and all that. [SIGH] Anyway --
R:  Yeah.  Definitely we'll be calling about that 'cause -- [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Really, you know.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Three weeks --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- unless they just, uh, pay once a month or something. [MN] 
R:  Right. [MN] Yeah. [MN] 
L:  And -- and he said he was getting calls like once a day but I don't know what his time frame was.  I just --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, okay.
L:  -- I just said six to nine and she said it would probably go until ten, and I s- -- I -- she -- and he said like, one da- --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- one -- one call a day but I haven't gotten any calls --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- for two, two or three days or so.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.  It's been like um, I'd say, you know, like certain days that I could probably be reached --
L:  Yeah -n I --
R:  -- and so --
L:  -- I may just do it Monday -- I'm changing it and doing it just Monday to Friday.  Not on the weekends. [NOISE] 
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah?
L:  Yeah, leave that open.
R:  It's hectic to do on the weekends?
L:  Yeah it is.  I don't want to be bothered.  Anyway --
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] 
L:  -- the topic -- should the athletes be paid that much?  I'm surprised -- well -- yes or no? [LAUGH] I'm actually surprised that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they have gotten that out- -- outlandish in their salaries.  But --
R:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH]  
L:  -- look at the movie stars.
R:  Yeah, yeah um --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- I -- you know, like I'd always had these [MN] you know kind of conversations about, well, you know their salaries are -- are just so high, you know, um --
L:  And who's paying for 'em?  I mean [MN] -- 
R:  -- and you think of -- yeah, like you think of other people who are actual -- in actual, you know -- 
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- professions, and often -- I'm not saying you know, [SIGH] athletes --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- you know, aren't um -- isn't a profession but it's kind of like, you know, a hobby -- doing what you love kind of thing.
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  [LIPSMACK] And there's always the possibility that [SIGH] -- you know, I guess because there's always the possibility of injury and that's so high --
L:  Well, that's what they claim --
R:  -- the risk is so high --
L:  -- that's what they're claiming --
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  -- but look at, uh, other people who have nor- -- what -- what we would consider, say, normal jobs -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- uh that -- let me -- you look at your firemen and policemen.
R:  Right.  They're not getting --
L:  They're not [SIGH] -- 
R:  -- nearly as much -- 
L:  They're not paid --
R:  -- as they should.
L:  No, and they're in a, I'd say, higher risk of getting injured, of even dying.
R:  [SIGH] And I mean for them all -- I mean -- you know, not to say that any injury is not [LIPSMACK] you know, um, [PAUSE] you know, is not like a scary thing I guess or whatever but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it -- it's to say that if you're trying to compare those two you know, it's not like they're necessarily going -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the likelihood --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- of them losing their life --
L:  Right.
R:  -- as opposed to a fireman or policeman or someone that is actually in the line of duty --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know.  [MN] For them, even when they do get hurt they're still going to get paid --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- this ridiculous amount of money.  Even if you're a b- -- if you're a bench warmer -- 
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- ah, you just sit on the bench the entire time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] You are still going to make, you know, at least, you know a million.  Def- --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, probably more than that 'cause I -- their um -- you know, um -- things are so -- their salaries are just based on so many different things.  Particularly like with their advertisements.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And things like that.  And you look at --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, some athletes compared to another --
L:  Well, I'm -- [SIGH] 
R:  -- you know, how do you --
L:  "-- I'm just wondering how it even got up that high.  I -- I can't remember if it was like, say, one athlete that decided, "Well, I'm going just to hold out for a higher salary" and then whoever was sponsoring him or whoever decided to pay his asking fee -- that's what started the ball rolling.  I mean, uh -- so it doesn't end there.  Then the next one comes along, "Well, he was getting so much.  I feel like I'm worth more --"
R:  Right.
L:  "-- ah, so I want this amount" or he's not gonna play.  I mean [LIPSMACK] --"
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I guess it's the same with the movie stars too.  They -- they want a certain price --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- now and [MN] -- I don't know.  Where do you, you know, cut off and say no?
R:  Right.  When do you say like, enough is enough?  You know, like --
L:  Well, that's it.  
R:  This is --
L:  Who decides?  And I mean -- 
R:  You know, who decides that and then who -- you know --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- there has to be a -- a cut off point.  They just you know --
L:  [NOISE] Well, [SIGH] it's -- it's beyond my understanding how they even get paid that amount.
R:  Right, and that --
L:  Where does the money come from?
R:  [MN] A lot of it would come from endorsements.
L:  Okay.  But i- -- [SIGH] 
R:  Um, a lot of the money comes from endorsements because I'm [LIPSMACK] -- I recently learned that, um, when athletes -- [MN] they are en- -- you know like there's an endorsement clause --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if you will.  Um, I don't know if that is -- I don't know how that works for certain athletes because obviously we see more -- they're more popular athletes [SIGH] -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- because of the endorsements that they do, and so we don't really get to see --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, even half of the NBA or half of, you know, the NFL --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or you know, any other -- any other sports --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- than we you know with the more --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- popular athletes like say a Michael Jordan or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know a Kobe Bryant or something like -- or someone like that.  So I'm wondering you know, with the -- with the ones that don't get paid as much, you know --
L:  How they feel and then also the ones coming up behind --
R:  Right
L:  -- is that all they're looking at the sports for?
R:  Is it -- 
L:  "All I wanna --"
R:  Is it money?
L:  Or, yes --
R:  You know?
L:  "-- earn this am- -- this amount of money" and, um, "I feel like I'm so much better than Michael Jordan or"  You know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's just um [LIPSMACK] -- it just doesn't seem to end.  It just seems to be going on and on.
R:  It's like a mentality.  It's -- they have a mentality of greed --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- and it's like the sport -- and that's where you have to, you know, question you know -- this whole money thing is at.  Where is the love for the sport?  You know?  If you're just doing it for the money, why are you doing it?  I mean, of course you should get paid if you, you know, if you're good at something.  You have a talent for something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, [SIGH] you know, it just becomes a point where the money shouldn't be a -- such you know, a factor as your love for the game.
L:  For the game and for doing your best or for whatever.
R:  Right, 'cause I think like, if I look at somebody like Michael Jordan and he came back his thir- -- for a third time after retirement and I -- to me what I saw was just his love for the game. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And at -- I mean, when you first start out and you're fresh and then when you're a rookie or what not, obviously you know, the money is going to be -- the determining factor is going to be the drive to make --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you, you know, wanna play the game.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But then you -- I mean, once you're in the game you start to realize that there -- as with anything, there's politics involved.
L:  [NOISE] Well, that's -- that's just it.  It's um -- I know they -- they had some controversy over this before but nothing -- nothing was resolved.  Nothing really seemed to end the exorb- -- +exorbitant pay of -- of athletes and um   I guess someone who comes along that says, "I don't need that amount of money" you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- "I want to play".  In other words, to make a point.  "Well, I'm playing it because, um [MN] I like --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- the sport and I want to do this and --"
R:  [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] 
L:  "-- um it's not because of the money".  But I don't think anyone --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- coming up behind all these other athletes are even gonna think of that.
R:  [NOISE] Right.  'Cause I don't think that they're getting [SIGH] you know, the -- the mentoring --
L:  No.
R:  -- you know, that they need, 'cause they -- half of these young kids coming from high school --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- some of 'em are not even finishing their education and they're going right into the game. 
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH] And you have to think about when those kids that -- you know, that age -- they're not prepared.  They're not mentally prepared.  I don't -- maybe not even emotionally, or even physically maybe, I don't know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to be prepared to play, you know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- in a league -- in a -- in an athletic league that can be very draining. 
L:  Right.
R:  And then, they -- they have that money and all they see is that money --
L:  Yeah, and --
R:  -- because they're still in that mind frame that [SIGH] you know, [NOISE] money [LIPSMACK] rules everything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then that's, you know, how a lot of these people end up in those situations.
L:  [LIPSMACK] I guess that's [MN] -- that's [MN] -- we just have to live with it but it's -- it's almost like thinking -- well, the price of things [MN] of everything else has gone up.  Homes -- I mean no matter what -- so I -- I can't even comprehend what it's gonna be like in thirty years. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  Um, so [MN] if the price of things always is --
