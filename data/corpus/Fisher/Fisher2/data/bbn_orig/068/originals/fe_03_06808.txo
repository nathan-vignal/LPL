L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK] Hello.
L:  Hello.  [NOISE] 
R:  Yes.  This is Linda.
L:  [NOISE] Hi.  I'm Brandy.
R:  Okay.  [SIGH] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  And I guess our topic is --
L:  [NOISE] Ah --
R:  -- professional athletes?
L:  [NOISE] -- yeah.  -t's ah, something about the stars and stripes they received or  [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Or strikes or --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- being on strike I think.
L:  Oh, being on strike.  Okay.
R:  Going on strike.  I think that's what it is.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  All right [NOISE] and the high salaries they get.  Right. 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  They get a lotta money.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I think it's a really --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- gigantic amount of money.
L:  Yeah.  I think they shouldn't be able to receive [LAUGH] that much.
R:  [LAUGH] Right.  But I guess that's --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- how much money, um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they're really making out of commercial --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- sports too.  I mean --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  -- so, um  [MN] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.  I mean I think I -- I -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- actually think we probably don't have too much debate here.  I think I agree with you. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Do you know -- [NOISE] 
R:  It's kind of ridiculous.
L:  -- who's trying to go on strike or ?
R:  No.
L:  Huh.
R:  No.  I -- so that's what I -- I don't know who's supposed to be going out on strike.  I mean, I guess this time of year it would be 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH] I don't know.
L:  Well, it's baseball season [NOISE] and  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah.  Interesting topic. [SIGH] [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Oh, w- yeah, except --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that once we both agree on it I don't know what we're [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- yeah.  Do you think one -- that one sport more i- --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- is um -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] more over priced than another?
L:  [NOISE] Well, um [NOISE] in my opinion I think baseball [NOISE] should be -- being the most high in paid [NOISE] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then basketball nex- [NOISE] but --
R:  Okay.
L:  Um.
R:  Yeah.  Why do you think that --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- for baseball?
L:  Baseball's more watched. [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Yeah.  Although, I think -- [MN] -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- do players in baseball have a longer career --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- than in basketball --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- generally?  I mean, I don- -- I guess I think about --
L:  Some of 'em [NOISE] like --
R:  -- yeah, 'cause I think about basketball players being younger.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I don't know why.
L:  [NOISE] No, there's -- there's a couple older people ah, tha- are baseball players.  Yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] Ah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  See, I'm from ah, Tacoma Washington [NOISE] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [NOISE] where we have the Mariners --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and we've got Edgar Martinez.
R:  Aha.
L:  [NOISE] He's like -- he's like, hello -- older. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh yeah.  I thought so.  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Like forty. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  That's -- and that's old for an athlete.  I mean --
L:  Oh yes, very old.
R:  -- [SIGH] 'cause that's the other part like, you know, sometimes I think [SIGH] for [MN] the athletes it's like you don't know how long --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- your career will be so get as much money as you can --
L:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] 
R:  -- while you can.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know.  But --
L:  Yeah.  Well, they make a lot of money. [NOISE] 
R:  -- it's hard for me to imagine that  yeah.  It's hard for --
L:  I wonder what they do with [LAUGH] all of it. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Right.  Right.
L:  I bet they -- [MN] y- know most of 'em, [NOISE] they give a lot of money to charities and stuff, which is nice.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I think their managers may -- apparently it costs a lot to be -- 
L:   [NOISE] 
R:  -- have a career too or --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- something but -- [SIGH] but yeah, I think that they're vastly --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- over paid.  Especially when you look at --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the salaries of other people.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um 
L:  Oh yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, right.  Like regular people.
L:  [LAUGH] Like my fiance only make twenty thousand a year and  [NOISE] 
R:  Who was this?
L:  My fiance does. [LAUGH] 
R:  Ooh.  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH] So [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] He's clearly not a professional athlete.  Right? [LAUGH] Right.
L:  Na, no, no. [MN] [NOISE] I know [NOISE] -- lemme see. [LIPSMACK]  I'm not sure ah, what my -- my second cousin's a athlete.  He plays for -- he's in the um -- in football.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] I'm not sure what his pay round is now or not, ah 
R:  Okay.  Is he on one of the big teams?
L:  [NOISE] He's going to college right now. [SIGH] 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [NOISE] Er 
R:  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  And so I think they get scholarships.  Of course that's the other crazy part.
L:  Ahah.
R:  It's like they're all supposed to be -- I mean --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they play full time but they're --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- not supposed to --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- get any money --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- for it or whatever, which 
L:  [NOISE] Yah.
R:  -- is a little backward.
L:  I think that's messed -- [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  Mm?
L:  -- that's messed up.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, I agree.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.  So, I -- you know.  [SIGH] 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I can't think of too much more to say about this except --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that they do make --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- too much.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah. [LIPSMACK] 
L:  [NOISE] [MN] 
R:  Yeah.  I dunno how I'd change it really.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  To me -- you see, I think most of them -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it would make more sense if they actually were part owners --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- of the team.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Y- know because  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [MN] You know, to me they should make money --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- from their own labor, you know.  Rather than --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- 'cause I think that's always their [SIGH] argument when they go on strike is that, well, the owners are making so much more than they are.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  So 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Maybe that should be equal or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like a percentage.  The owners should get the perc- --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- percentage of each player.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And not [NOISE] just like all the -- [NOISE] everybody's money. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] [MN]
R:  Yeah.  'Cause like y- said 'n that, -- goes along with, you know -- [MN] I mean I -- [MN] to me they should make more if they win and less if they lose. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  You know  but 
L:  Yeah, that'll give 'em an incentive. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE] Yeah.  I would think so.  But I --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I don't know if that applies so much to --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- other kinds of work, you know.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So 
L:  I dunno, like [NOISE] [SIGH] I'm not sure about the, you know, the lower sports.  They should, [NOISE] you know  um [NOISE] -- like stuff that is harder to do.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] They should get paid, you know, an equal amount.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  [NOISE] Um 
R:  Yeah.  See and I do- -- I don't know how they all -- [SIGH] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- well, you know, like golfers and all those kind of people -- I don't how it all --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- evens out or measures up.
L:  [NOISE] I'm not sure.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah.
R:  But then golf's not like -- it's not a contact sport either you know. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  Mm.  Mm.
L:  [MN] [NOISE] Like ice hockey.  I don't know how much they get paid but  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH]
R:  But I think they get banged around a lot. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't think I'd want to play ice hockey --
L:  No, they should get paid pretty -- they'd need to get paid pretty good [LAUGH] because they get banged up. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah [LAUGH] right.  [NOISE] Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  And then I don't know how women's sports --
L:  [NOISE] [MN]
R:  -- um, line up.  Well, I mean --
L:  I know they get paid less --
R:  -- we do.  We know they don't  yeah --
L:  -- which is not fair --
R:  -- like lots -- Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- because women are as equal as men --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- or better. [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah, yeah.  You know, but I guess they don't, y- know -- they're not yet pulling --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- as much of an audience.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  So, I guess [SIGH] -- I mean, to me it's like --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- professional athletes are sort --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- of in that --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- same category with --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- like movie stars.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  I know, which is all kind of crazy to me -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but  [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] I dunno.  It's p- part of a world I'm not -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- or it's part of the world that I'm not part of, [LAUGH] you know, except --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [LIPSMACK] [MN] -- buying tickets I guess.  So 
L:  [NOISE] [MN] -ell I watch wrestling. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And the women in them are equal in that so 
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Okay.  [SIGH] I've never actu- -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ha- you been to professional women's wrestling?
L:  [NOISE] Um, I've been to --
R:  Yep. 
L:  -- WWE.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And women own it -- [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  D- you know how they g- -- do they get paid at all equal to men in wrestling?
L:  Um, I'm pretty sure they do uh, on WWE --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- because -- I mean [SIGH] -- half of the owner -- I mean, two owners are women.
R:  Yeah, right, okay.  Great.
L:  [NOISE] So 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh no, I didn't mean that I don't watch sports or anything like that.  I just meant --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] I -- I know I'm never going to be a professional athlete.
L:  [NOISE] [MN] [LAUGH]
R:  I also don't expect to be a movie star you know [LAUGH] so 
L:  [NOISE] I wish I was a movie star. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that'd be pretty good.
L:  I could never be a movie star. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Not that skinny. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I think some plastic surgery or something --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah right. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and a tummy tuck.
R:  Ahah.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, yeah, so   
L:  [NOISE] Oh --
R:  Yeah, well I think we're probably in agreement that they should pay 'em -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- less and -- but that they should definitely be -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they should pay attention to -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- what they pay women.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  Yep.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Okay?  Yep.
L:  [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] Or that'd be sexist. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.  I agree.  Yeah.  Oh and hopefully --
L:  Yeah.  Someone sooner or later will pull off [NOISE] something like that. [LAUGH] Yeh, better watch it. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.  Yep.  Yep.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Well, and if you know -- I think if more --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- women watched women's sports --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know -- I mean we're more than half the world --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- we probably could kinda even this out -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, pretty quickly.
L:  Mm yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  So, yeah.  [SIGH] D- d'you very many --
L:  Not that many women's sports are on TV. [NOISE] 
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, w- yea --
L:  I'm sure if there -- it was on TV that more people would watch. [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] Well, that's a good point.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.  You know, 'cause at the -- yeah, the stations keep saying, "Well, nobody would watch --"
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  "-- so we don't put it on" but if they don't put it on  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we can't watch.
L:  Well guys would watch because they'd want to watch the women.
R:  Well, that's [LAUGH] -- that's true too. [LAUGH] Yeah, you're right.  Right.
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, yeah, so  [SIGH] that's pretty much all I have to say about this topic.
L:  Yeah.
R:  How -bout you?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.  Yeah.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Well, I guess we can just sort of wait for the --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- ten minutes. [NOISE]  I have no idea how [NOISE] long [NOISE] we've been talking.
L:  [NOISE] N- yeah.
R:  Have you done [NOISE] very many of these? [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] Uh, this is my third. [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, [NOISE] okay.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Okay.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  [SIGH] 
R:  Nice work?
L:  First one, the cheque took a long time. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh okay.  Well, I haven't -- I was gonna -- I haven't gotten any -- when did you start --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- with 'em?
L:  Ah -- [MN] a while ago.  Um [NOISE] -- like -- ah, I've done --
R:  'Cause I really -- I -- I did one, I guess two nights ago and then tonight.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  That's --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I think they just need people [NOISE] 'cause they can't -- 
R:  -- these are my first one --
L:  -- find anybody.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] But I think y- know -- I -- I'll +probably only do three but, I mean, for some people they can do up to twenty or something like that.  
R:  Oh, okay
L:  But that's nice. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ten dollars a pop. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  [MN] It's interesting.
R:  Yeah, I guess we should put our -- our two cents in about that too.  [SIGH] They should pay more for these interviews. [LAUGH] No. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Well, I mean  [NOISE] a dollar a minute's pretty good. [NOISE] 
R:  That's true.  It is.  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Well for, like cameo player, y- know, on the internet. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.  Mm.
L:  +Internet. [NOISE] 
R:  True.  Mm.  Okay. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Well, I think we can probably just --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- can we hang up?
L:  No.  It +has to wait for the beep an- --
R:  Oh 
L:  -- then you put -- 
R:  Okay. 
L:  -- in your comments.
R:  Okay.
L:  [MN] [NOISE] 
R:  Okay.  Do you play any sports?
L:  [NOISE] Um, I -- I do with the guys, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I play baseball. [NOISE] 
R:  Oh okay.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  And ah --
R:  And so it's a coed team is it?
L:  Um.  Not a --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- team or nothing but just for fun --
R:  Oh okay. [NOISE] 
L:  -- ah, we get all together --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and we play.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  You know -- 
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- our family and stuff like that.
R:  Oh that's neat.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Mm.  We go play baseball  [LAUGH] 
R:  Our family was just like never athletic --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and now even -- I mean, I've got sons and they're -- I mean like --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- full grown and we still don't --
L:  [NOISE]
