R:  Hi, I'm James.
L:  Hi, my name is Lorraine and I'm from Wisconsin. [NOISE]
R:  Okay, Wisconsin, I'm -- I'm here in Kansas, uh --
L:  Oh, so both in the middle -- middle west.
R:  Midwest, yeah.  Midwest talks about the Middle East, you know.
L:  [LAUGH] That -- that's about it a little bit.
R:  Yeah.  So, what do we -- what are your thoughts?
L:  [MN]
R:  What -- what do you feel about going on over there?
L:  Well, I tell you as a female I -- I get very panicky whenever they start anything in the Middle East, basically because I -- fortunately, I don't have sons, I have daughters but, uh --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it just scares me so much when I think of the young people going yet I know that things could never be the way they were, especially with, uh, um, Saddam being in power and that scares me just as much.  Uh, so I -- I ha- I kinda go back and forth on that I -- I feel we have to be there and yet again it's -- I -- I don't wanna see anybody having to have a son got there and lose their lives or whatever so I mean that's -- that's my actual feeling on it.
R:  Gotcha, well, yeah, totally.  I -- I agree and the fact that it's like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- well, to a point now, are we gonna get anything done over there at all.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean, are these people going over there just for the sake of going there 'cause I mean, there's -- I mean, it's trying -- it's interesting trying to see if, you know, like, right now it's -- yes, we're helping them but it's like do they -- the- do they really need and do they want our help, do they need our help, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to the point where how -- are we just going, you know, it- it's how we're setting up this new government with them over there, um, in Iraqi especially, um --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- are we -- you know, are they just -- I mean, there's gonna be tension building up there to a point where we -- you know, the best thing is they've already said to do like if we can get in there and just sort of try to set this government and put them back in power as quickly as possible.  Put, you know, put the -- some kind of sort of semi democratic government in power then the better for us but I don't see any --
L:  And it does get scary too, uh, as far as I'm concerned because, uh, yeah, now that the -- the actual fighting is over but it -- I -- I get the feeling that there's a lot of these people that really, like you say, don't want us over there and, uh, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- with the continued fighting and shooting and, uh, that part scares me as well, you know, I mean, they were happy when, um, [MN] o- our boys were fighting over there --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but now that it's over the- it's like they don't want a government set up, uh, or at least that's my opinion of it. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, they don't want a government set up and it's like now the sooner we would get out of there the happier they would be.  And I don't think that's right.  I do think they still do need the help to set up a government.  I don't want our government to be there, uh, permanently --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to, you know, set -- to, uh, run that country but I do think that that country is, um, to a point where they do need the help to get themselves back on their feet and to -- to have our government help them in that sense, but not to stay their permanently.
R:  Sure and -- and -- and that's the thing, it's like, you know, they -- just like if we -- if anybody -- if we were having problems in this country and we desperately needed some other foreign country to come help us, we would want them to do that but as soon as they were done they're like, "Okay, it's our thing, it's our country, we'll take care -- over from here".  So, they do need to have some kind structure put in place and they should be willing but at the same time it's kind of -- you know, the- they're -- their trust in like in the US and in England has been there for so many years the fact that, you know, before World War One none of these countries existed.  All these countries were pretty much created, um, at the -- at the end of World War One but, uh, by, you know, England and France and the US.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, it's kinda -- it's -- so the problem -- that's the thing, like they're just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, we have -- we have such bad history with them and it just -- they -- they like certain things -- certain things like about us.  I mean, there's -- there's -- there's no doubt that they want peace freedoms and such but they want it on their terms which I can totally understand and that's the thing that's trying to -- you know, I  -- and I can -- you know, I -- I, like I said, if we want to make the situation better we -- we give them guidance but we don't try to -- we've gotta make sure that we kinda do it from -- let them look like they're doing most of the work.
L:  Mhm -- or they're making the -- the a- final decision as to how they wanna --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- have it done.
R:  Exactly.
L:  I agree with that a hundred percent.  Do you -- uh, I don't know if we're -- I'm getting off the topic or not but when we were there -- and, I mean, I'm sure you sound a lot younger than what I am, uh, but when we were there in the early nineties --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- do you think they should have gone farther with it and taken care of everything at that time instead of having this prolonged type thing where it started all over again?
R:  Well, it -- it's [inaudible] I mean, I've heard so many diffe- different thoughts over the years that, you know, part of -- one of the reasons US didn't want to because really it was like the less of two evils.  They really didn't know about what the Kurds were gonna be up to and putting the Kurds in power was gonna help, you know, in giving them all these -- all the -- all the attent- all the, um, sort of arms and everything that they needed to get that job --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- done.  I think at that time they really, they didn't -- they hadn't had any idea pretty much of who to believe in in -- in that sense 'cause, you know, you had the -- the Shiites in the south who were backing Iran, you had the Kurds in the north, you know, it's -- it -- it's just been such -- it's been -- I mean, Iraq's another one of those countries where so many different people who want a piece of the pie that I don't know if the US really -- you know, it wasn't really their intention, they went in there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to capture Kuwait but, you know -- you know, maybe they thought that at that time Saddam really could be more controlled with UN sanctions and such than just have a total new government in there.  And I think now with -- you know, what sort -- we've seen over the last, you know, twelve t- uh, ten, twelve years, ten -- ten years here is the fact that in this --
L:  I didn't work.
R:  -- time it -- it just didn't really work, they supported the terrorists and then, you know, that kind of thing.  So, you know, it -- it --
L:  [MN] I just -- I -- a lot of times I know we discussed that around, uh, uh, with just family members as well and you get a lot of that goes both ways.  My opinion I- I guess I still look at it they wish they would have stuck with it a little bit more back in the nineties.  Um, again I agree with what you're saying though that they, uh, in all probability felt that, uh, Saddam probably they could have controlled him a little bit more and it never turned out that way.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, to see and to still see what I see in the paper, uh, or even read or hear on the news, you know, I mean, the, uh, things that that man had done I feel it was something that our country had to do was to step in.  I -- again, I'm not for any kind of wars, um, in -- in the sense of an actual war but it is unbelievable I said th- the different things that his man has done, how he's persecuted people, um, the whole nine yards.   I have never in my life -- just from watching -- I have a tendency to watch CNN and to see these -- the people, the fear that was written on these people's --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- faces, um, to me was just belief, um, when this first had started.
R:  Right.
L:  And it was a -- a fear that they didn't wanna talk or say anything and then, you know, as it was com- coming closer to an end to see, like, a total turnaround was something that -- I -- I still have -- find that very hard to comprehend something like that.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.  And I said, it -- it -- it will be interesting to see what, you know, what -- what we can do.  I mean, it like -- I mean, there's so many other atrocities around the world that we're not even helping with, you know, you've got the Congo and you've got other things like that where people just need -- you know, genocide going all over the place but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, that -- that's -- it's scary to think that what people -- what certain people -- well, how certain people in certain cultures value life --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- to the point where it is just so expendable, it's so -- yeah, it's just part of daily --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- business, you know.
L:  That's right, that's right.  It's almost -- I get that impr- you know, I mean, that life is so unimportant to other people and [MN] to me that -- you know, I mean, that is the biggest -- the greatest thing we have is our lives.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And like to have the freedom that we have and to be able to do things or express your feelings about things, um, I treasure that and I guess the older I get the more I treasure it and I -- I've gotten to a point where I respect it a lot more than I did, um -- I can remember, you know, I mean, when I was in my twenties and things and how you take thing- -- and I don't know if this is for everybody but we take things so much for granted and, uh, like I say, the older I get the more I see this, the more you realize, uh, just what a -- how fortunate we are to be where we are --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- and not to have [MN], you know, I mean, to live in a -- in a country like the Middle East, I says, and -- and the problems that go along with it, it is just, to me, beyond belief, you know, I mean, or -- or to hi- even to comprehend something like that I says I -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- just find it really, really [MN] -- just unbelievable.  I says I'd -- I don't know I says I -- like I say, I  -- my feelings still will be and probably will be as long as I live I -- I never wanna see anybody have to go war.  I never wanna see anybody have to lose their lives but I -- I do feel that this was a necessity as much as it was, um, [LIPSMACK] oh I can't even think what that other country was where [MN] to defend where the oil was and everything else, you know, I says --
R:  Kuwait.
L:  -- uh, i- it's just a scary situation all the way around but I says I -- my honest opinion, it was something that had to be done and I'm glad that -- that our country did step in and did go ahead the way they did.
R:  Right.  Well, I understand, I mean, if -- if the US wants to make things better it's gonna be -- maybe a lot of it is gonna come down to how -- what role they play and wh- who -- how they support this -- the Israeli Palestinian, um, talks right now is the fact that, you know, that is the -- probably the main reason why the Middle East hates us is because we're not really -- when we going to these things we're not really going out there to try to -- to m- help both sides we're just -- y- you know, we've always come out for so much more pro Israel that the whole Middle East has one more other reason to hate us.
L:  [NOISE] Y- yes.  Yes.
R:  [inaudible] because Israel was pretty much a European state I ...
