R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  Hello.
R:  Hi.  [LAUGH] I'm Gail.
L:  Hi.  I'm Fawn.
R:  Hi [LAUGH].  How are you?
L:  I'm good.  How are you? [NOISE] 
R:  Just fine.  [PAUSE]
L:  Okay [LAUGH].
R:  Have you done this before?
L:  No, I haven't [LAUGH].
R:  I haven't either [LAUGH].
L:  Okay.  Er, we're supposed to start talking about --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- the subject.
R:  -- apparently, er, apparently so.  Em, I haven't gotten any preliminary call on this.  But, em, I guess our topic's airport security [LAUGH].
L:  Yes.
R:  Did you hear anything about, em, what happened in Australia?  They were two incidents the past two days.
L:  Oh, no, I haven't.
R:  Oh gosh!  There's ...  Apparently, one guy got through with sharpened wooden sticks and try -- and assaulted two of the airline, you know, attendants.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And tried to bust into the cockpit.  And that -- I -- I -- I heard that yesterday.  And then today they said something about a guy that had an aerosol can and a lighter.  And that was also in Australia. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I mean, you know, it sounds like they're just trying to [NOISE] get around, you know, your typical, [NOISE] these are what we think of as weapons --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- at this point.  
L:  But, do you think that's, er, like their -- do you think they're, I guess, er, security system is similar to ours?
R:  I don't know.  I --
L:  Because I would think, like, sharpened wooden sticks maybe, might not get through.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know.  I guess it all depends on how big they are, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, oh, and something like that seems like it could be sown into the sides of, em, luggage, you know, if you have the soft sided luggage, or whatever.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I just don't know.  But, em, they said on the news that it sounded like, um, there have been plots before nine -- nine eleven to -- for this sort of thing in Australia, and ...  so you think they would have tightened down when we tightened down --
L:  Oh, right.
R:  -- you know.
L:  Right.
R:  I don't know.
L:  So [NOISE] -- so, I guess, em, to answer the question, like, yes or no.  Do you fee safer when you, er, fly, or [PAUSE] -- or do you try --
R:  [SIGH] Well, really, I just feel --
L:  -- avoid the plane?
R:  -- annoyed when I fly [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Annoyed, angry, you know --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- it -- I -- I can't seem to apply it to, this really needs to be happening to keep me safe, when I'm in a hurry.
L:  Mhm -- mhm.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] Okay.
R:  What about you?
L:  Um, well, like, er, I flew a lot last year.  Like, I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- pretty much flew, like, once a week.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I didn't -- I didn't feel like much safer, because I kind of sort of did --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- get away with, like, bringing stuff [LAUGH] in.
R:  Mhm [LAUGH].
L:  Because I guess, like, I'm a girl and so they didn't care too much. [SIGH]
R:  And then you hear that crazy stuff, like, they assaulted the eighty year old woman, and, you [LAUGH] know.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, right -- right. 
R:  [LAUGH] You hear the crazy, horror story parts too, so ...
L:  Yeah -- yeah, so -- [LIPSMACK] yeah, ah, it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, it's -- I guess the new security procedures don't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- bother me too much, like, except when they searched me.  'Cause I feel, like, I don't look that threatening.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I sort of --
R:  That's me.  I'm five foot two.  What am I going to do to these guys, [LAUGH] you know.
L:  Yeah -- yeah.  So, it's sort of -- I don't know.  I'm not sure about their policy about not -- I guess racial profiling [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  So, I don't know if that's worked or not, but I don't know how they do that, but, um, -- [MN] yeah, it's just -- it's annoying when they bother me, I guess [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  But otherwise, like, waiting in line, and stuff, is not a big deal, but ...
R:  It's actually a lot better than I thought it [NOISE] would be, um, even international flights have been better than I thought it would be.
L:  Mhm.
R:  'Cause I've been coming in from, like, the Caribbean and Mexico, and stuff like that.  It's not like I've come in from Europe or the Middle East, but, you know, it's -- it's not as bad as I would think it would be but, you know, d- domestic flights, the lines [NOISE] have just been stupid here.  I'm like in the deep -- deep south [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Oh.
R:  And, you know, see how the good old boys that are just -- they wanna do the job as best they can and it -- it gets kind of pointless and ridiculous, you know.
L:  Mhm -- mhm.
R:  Like, do you really think that we're in that much danger and maybe in Alabama right now?  You know.
L:  Ahah.
R:  I just don't see us as being a huge target.
L:  Oh, right -- right.
R:  But, you know, I guess because flights go in and out of Atlanta and everything goes in and out of Atlanta, through the whole country it seems like.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They're just -- they seem a whole lot stricter there.
L:  Mhm. [PAUSE]
R:  I just -- I don't know.  [PAUSE]  But 
L:  I don't know have they put in, like, um, [MN] enforced barriers for the cockpit, yet?  I -- I'm not keeping up with the [LAUGH] news.
R:  I honestly -- I don't know.  They're -- I heard something the other day about, um, they're reviewing again whether or not pilots could have firearms, and --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- I -- I never really heard what they decided on it.
L:  So, what do you think about that?
R:  I think it's ridiculous because, I mean, just the whole concept of you're in a pressurized cabin.  You don't want a gunshot going off.  I don't care whose shooting.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Whether it's the pilot, or, you know, a terrorist.  You don't want a gunshot happening in a pressurized cabin.
L:  But what if you --
R:  Period, you know. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  -- but what if you have, like, a terrorist with a gun?  Wouldn't you want the pilot to have a gun?
R:  Well, I --
L:  'Cause somebody's gonna --
R:  -- I -- I think that --
L:  -- be shot anyways, possibly, you know.
R:  You know, I think that if the pilot and the flight attendants have, like, those stun gun, the little voltage deals --
L:  Oh, ahah.
R:  -- I -- I think that would be so much more efficient.  You're not in danger of shooting a hole in the plane --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know.  I mean, even just a tiny bullet hole.  If you've got a gun that's big enough to stop a terrorist lunging at you and not just, like, injure him, but just stop him in his tracks, then you've got a gun that's gonna blow a whole through the side of a pressurized cabin.  You know, even like a dime sized hole can, you know, cause terrible things to [LAUGH] happen in that cabin.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, and I just think that it -- if they would have this high voltage stun guns for all of the flight crew.  Well, that would just be, you know, it would be a whole lot more efficient.  You'd just have to keep them charged up, you [LAUGH] know. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, I think that that would be the best possible option.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, I've heard, er, somewhere where, actually depressurization might be helpful --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- 'cause then everyone falls asleep, or something [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So, then that would stop the, er, terrorist as well, I guess.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But ...
R:  But, if they've already gotten into the cockpit, you know, then something's gonna happen to the pilot.
L:  Oh yeah, that's true.
R:  You know, if they've gotten that far as to get through the cockpit doors. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, I think the plan was, like, if the -- if --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the, um, pilots knew what was going on then they can depressurize the cabin outside, or something.
R:  That would be cool.  That --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] [PAUSE]
L:  Hello?  [PAUSE]  Hello?  [PAUSE]  Hello?  [LAUGH] [PAUSE] Hello?  [NOISE]
