L:  [NOISE] Hello, my name is Pietra.
R:  [NOISE] Hello, my name --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- is Lyn.
L:  [NOISE] Hi Lyn, how're you doing?
R:  Okay.  How are you?
L:  Okay. [NOISE] 
R:  Ah, did you catch exactly what we're supposed to be talking about? [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Ah, professional athletes and the incomes that they make.
R:  Oh.
L:  Their salaries.
R:  Okay.  [COUGH]
L:  Did you hear what they said?
R:  Yeah.  Well, sort of.  I wasn't quite sure.  I thought they said something about strikes.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  They said -- they were saying how athletes strike -- have a tendency of striking or shutting down the program because they're not getting their funds --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- their cheques and what not.
R:  Yeah.  Okay.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't know a whole lot about that subject --
L:  [NOISE] Neither do I.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- 'cause I'm not into sports. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's like, oh boy. 
L:  Where you at Lyn? [LIPSMACK] 
R:  [LAUGH] Taylorville, Illinois. 
L:  God bless you.  I'm up in Brooklyn, New York.
R:  Oh boy. [LAUGH] 
L:  North east.
R:  That's a long way away --
L:  And you're mid west, I believe.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Wow, that is something else.  Anyway, they want us to talk about, uh, the athletes and, ah, how -- how they, um -- I -- I disagree with all the money they're earning.
R:  Yeah.  That's --
L:  That's a bit --
R:  -- kind of outrageous I think, too. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah 'cause that -- that's ridiculous.
R:  Mm.
L:  I mean, to play ball -- I wish I knew how.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  I wish I didn't have a back problem.  I'd be out there too.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  I don't know what the reason is.  I guess there's a lot of people that like sports and they're willing to pay a lot to -- you know.
L:  I never heard of anything so ridiculous in my life.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  It is ridiculous.  I mean, I just heard about a young man -- a basketball [NOISE] player still in high school, [LIPSMACK] and he's going to be doing, I think a Nike commercial or, um [LIPSMACK] something like that, and he's getting -- he's going to get ninety million.
R:  Oh, jeez. [LAUGH]
L:  And I said to my- --
R:  And he's still in high school? [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] He's not even finished high school yet.
R:  Oh boy.
L:  And then they -- I had heard on the news that, um, Michael Jordan on his first Nike, he only got two and a half million.
R:  Mm oh. [LAUGH] 
L:  So, I know he should strike real quick behind that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] Oh boy.  You know --
L:  [SIGH] You never know how long ten minutes is until you get on it and you run out of talk, you know?
R:  Yeah [LAUGH]
L:  [COUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.  The last time I -- you know, there was a lot in common there, of what we was talking about so ... [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah so this nice little --
R:  Ten minutes were up real fast. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] What was that? [NOISE] 
R:  It went real fast the last time I did this --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because it was something that you had some interest in.
L:  That you was familiar with -- yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH] Yeah.  And then you have your soccer players.  They're -- they look like a bunch of fools with a ball.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  But who's -- who am I to speak? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Do you like baseball?  Do you like any sports?
R:  Oh, not really.  I'm not into sports at all. [LAUGH] 
L:  No.  Well, that's -- the computer hit us hard then.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm not into any sports but I do admire football.
R:  Oh yeah.  Yeah, my husband, he likes the Steelers.  He loves the Steelers. [LAUGH]
L:  Pittsburgh Steelers.  Look on out of here.  Heaven, I could talk to you for hours. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh yeah? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Rave on the phone? [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  [MN] I love football.  [LIPSMACK] [MN] 
R:  Yeah.  It's like boy I can tell when he's watching that; he's whooping and a hollering. [LAUGH] 
L:  [COUGH] [LAUGH] 
R:  He's got everything -- the Steelers, you know -- anything they make, he wants.  You know we never --
L:  He's got to have it.
R:  Yeah.  We never run out of things for his birthday.  [LAUGH] We go --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- look for something Steelers. [LAUGH]
L:  And then he goes seeking and searching. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  I, uh, I need a -- I need to have a friend take me to see a baseball game.  Then he has to school me through it in order for me to comprehend baseball 'cause that's slow. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] And that seems so time consuming.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, some people get so excited about it but I don't know.  I've never been. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, and I'm trying to figure out what's the excitement about?  They're running after a silly ball.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  You know? [LAUGH] That's my theory. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  I think if I had time --
L:  If they're recording this they're going to laugh.
R:  -- if I had time to, you know, watch the games and stuff that -- you know, I just don't have time to get into that. [LAUGH]
L:  No.  Of course not.  We're into the cooking field.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  The dog and the cooking and the cleaning and the kids and, it's like --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- "Who has time for that?" [LAUGH]
L:  Oh gosh.  How many children do you have?
R:  Two.
L:  God bless you.
R:  Mm.  How many do you have?
L:  [LIPSMACK] None. 
R:  No. [LAUGH]
L:  I'm lucky. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't have to get through all that. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a challenge boy.  [LAUGH]
L:  I can imagine.
R:  I don't know what people do with these big families.  I don't have time for anything I've got to do. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] I cannot imagine uh, [NOISE] anybody that's got any more than two.
R:  Mm.
L:  But they have them and I'm trying to figure out well, how d- -- how do you feed i- -- you know, how do you feed so many mouths?
R:  Yeah.  Sure my husband's got eight brothers. [LAUGH]
L:  God bless his family.  Oh my gosh almighty.
R:  Yeah.  And so they always had plenty enough to eat, his mom was cooking all the time.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, God bless her.  Mhm.  God bless her -together.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Good heavens.  No, I -- I -- ah -- I'm a widow so I -- I don't have that opportunity.
R:  Oh.
L:  But it's okay.  That was a long time ago.
R:  Oh.
L:  But it's okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But we're supposed to be talking about sports. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah [MN] [LAUGH] I know, sports. [LAUGH] Yeah, when they said that it's like, "Oh no". [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, right. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  How's the weather there?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, just fine.  It's um, sunny and about in the seventies today.
L:  Oh, bless your heart.  We've got sun.  We had -- we had sun today.
R:  Mm.
L:  Sun, but it looks like it's gonna rain soon.
R:  Yeah.  I think tomorrow is canceled[?] -- 
L:  Yeah.  They're talking about a shower.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, we've had enough rain here.  We would like to see --
L:  Same thing here.
R:  [MN] Yeah. [LAUGH] But we've had some mild weather where, um, an- -- we haven't had the air conditioning or the heating on for quite a while now, so that helps on the bills. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh yeah.  That's cool -- yeah, definitely -- definitely helps.
R:  And my daughter, she's going to be joining the Navy so she's running --
L:  Oh, God bless her.
R:  -- I guess y- could consider that [LAUGH] -- you'd be considered sports I guess -- running. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, right, right. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] An athlete.
L:  What kind of sports did your children like?
R:  Well. my son -- he's soccer in the fall.  He'll play soccer.  That's all he's really interested in.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  An- -- and my daughter, she's never really been into any kind of sports at all.
L:  Look at that.
R:  No, she's not very physically inclined, but now she wants to be in [LAUGH] the Navy so --
L:  In the Navy, yes she'll be --
R:  -- she's having to -- you know.
L:  [NOISE] -- you got to be really athletic for that -- that position.
R:  Yeah, she's having to, you know, kinda get --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- trained for that otherwise, boy, she go in there without [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- any of that, you're in trouble.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, really.  Mhm.  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  I'm kind of nervous her doing that but, [MN] we've got military throughout our family and that's --
L:  Oh well then, that's good.  
R:  -- what she's --
L:  That works well with the family.
R:  -- yeah, she decided that's what she wants to do so 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm.
L:  What're you gonna do?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Bless her on the way.
R:  Yeah. [MN]
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  At least she'll be on a ship and not on the [LAUGH] -- the ground over there.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hope she's a good swimmer.
R:  Yeah.  She's -- yeah, she took some lessons and she's pretty good at that. [LAUGH]
L:  That's good.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] So where did you say you're from?
L:  Brooklyn, New York.
R:  Okay.  Yeah, I can tell with the accent. [LAUGH]
L:  North east.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I can tell your accent too. [LAUGH] You never realize you have an accent 'til you hear someone else.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And then you realize, "Wow, do I?". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Now, that's a place I've never been -- over in that area --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- before.  I was always just down --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- either Florida and just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- kind of in the middle of the country there.  I've never been to New York before.  [LAUGH]
L:  Ah hah.
R:  Oh, it looks like a --
L:  Well, maybe in the future you -- you'll pass on by.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  How far are you from New York City then?
L:  I am in New York.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I am, I am. 
R:  Oh.
L:  [MN] It's just across the bridge.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
L:  It's -- it's not even a long trip.
R:  Yeah.
L:  No, it's like twenty minutes to get into New York City.
R:  Now, your life is probably way different than mine here. 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  We're out in the country -- 
L:  Oh my God, I would love to see that.
R:  [LAUGH] -- with the cows and the pastures. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  That's all I've known. [LAUGH] 
L:  What county are you in?
R:  Um, Christian County.
L:  Christian County.
R:  Yeah, just right dead center of Illinois.
L:  Ah hah.  Right in the middle.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  The --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- heart of it.
R:  Yup.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  Th- -- I don't know if I'd like that city life or not.  That's a lot of noise --
L:  It's -- it's --
R:  -- and traffic and [LAUGH] --
L:  -- honey, it's too busy over here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  People are running like  and I'm trying to figure out why they're running.
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] they're in a fast +lane and don't know why. [LAUGH] 
L:  Exactly.  Yeah, yeah.  Th- -- th- -- th- -- they really are.  That's all I can say.
R:  Yeah.  That's what, um --
L:  [LAUGH] Most of them look like athletes anyhow.
R:  [MN] [LAUGH] When I graduated from high school I went to uh -- well -- Springfield, Illinois which isn't, you know, that big and that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I didn't even care for that.  That was too much for me. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [several inaudible words] 
L:  To much city-ism huh?
R:  What?
L:  To much city-ism huh?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Just don't like that noise, you know --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- whenever you're out in the country --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and that, and the peacefulness --
L:  Oh, yeah --
R:  -- and, [LAUGH] you know  yo- --
L:  -- I can imagine. [NOISE]  I can definitely imagine.
R:  But I guess if you grew up like that, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it would be different.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  So 
L:  I can definitely imagine that.
R:  [MN]
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, how many times have you done this so far?
L:  [NOISE] Say that again?  Oh this my first time.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, I'm lost for words now.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, I wasn't even going to answer the phone and I picked it up and I hear the computer going and I said, "That's quick" because I just got -- I just got into this program today. [NOISE] 
R:  Oh.  Oh boy.
L:  They interviewed me today and um, I couldn't imagine what the hell the woman was saying, but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- now I do. [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I've got a twin sister that she gets on the internet all the time and she tells me about different things and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- stuff and that.  I don't have time for that, um.  She doesn't work and that so she's on --
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
R:  -- the internet, getting all her deals and stuff.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
R:  She just loves that.  She likes getting her mail --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and seeing what --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know [MN] -- things she gets into -- I dunno.
L:  She gets into everything in other words.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  It's like, I just don't have time for that.  But she has fun with it. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, bless her heart. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So, you got any pets?

L:  Yeah.
R:  -- quite know the difference of that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The difference is nine for every one of ours. [NOISE]
