L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, this is Kinole[?].
R:  Hi, this is Lee.
L:  Hi, how are you doing?
R:  Good, I'm fine.
L:  Okay, this is my first time actually using the -- the, ah -- the system.
R:  Ah, okay.  This is only my second, so --
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, it's a little awkward for the first few seconds but that's about it I guess.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So I guess our topic is the Middle East.
L:  Yeah, I guess so.  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, and where are you from?  Where do you live?
L:  Um, actually, originally I'm from [inaudible], but right now I live in Canada, um.
R:  Okay, so you probably have a good perspective.
L:  Well, I, um, somewhat.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, maybe a little more worldly than me.  I've only lived in the United States, you know.
L:  Yeah.  Where -- where do you live in the US?
R:  Ah, Tennessee.
L:  Oh yeah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- okay, I've actually gone to school in the US, um, for a couple of years in Ohio --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, ah, that is where I -- I met my husband and then we moved up here to Canada.
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  All righty.
R:  Okay, so, well, I guess, um, I'm going to speak from George Bush's perspective and, um, I think they y- -- the cop- -- topic is should the US stay involved in the peace process in the Middle East and, you know --
L:  Right, mhm.
R:  -- what do we think of that and all and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I -- I -- I, you know, I -- I'm not really prejudiced in any way, but I just think that being a -- you know, as powerful a country as we are, you know, in -- in many respects I think that we really should stay involved even though a lot of people don't like us for it, you know.
L:  Mhm, okay.
R:  So.
L:  Well, you know what I -- I actually think that US is, um, doing more damage than, ah, they're actually helping --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because, um, I really think that US's position is not as, um, objective as it should be.  I think that they have a lot of interests of their own that they're trying to pursue there instead of, you know, rather than just going for the welfare of the people who live there.
R:  Yeah, it's hard I guess, you know, and I -- it depends on what country we're talking about I guess, so I don't know if we're talking about Afghanistan or Israel --
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  -- or Pakistan or --
L:  Um, I was actually just talking about, um, Iraq, I -- I was talking --
R:  In Iraq, yeah, mhm, of course.
L:  -- you know, I -- I was, ah, you know, of course, the oil and everything that, ah, I think that a lot of people, ah, you know, know what exactly US is seeking there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean --
R:  But actually, see we -- now we only got three -- about three percent of our oil from Iraq, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and we get a large percent from -- we get some oil from Russia and other different places --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, you know, in all fairness, um, we did take care of quite a brutal dictator over there, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and now it's up -- really up to the people to do their own whatever they need to do for themselves, I mean we -- we really can't control them at all, you know, and I don't think that we really want to.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It wouldn't be fair to them, you know.
L:  Right, well, you know, I really don't know --
R:  But, um --
L:  -- um [SIGH] ah, about the, ah, about Saddam Hussein, I really don't know about him, um, as much -- as far as, you know, he --
R:  As far as being a dictator you mean?
L:  Yeah.  'Cause I -- I really didn't, um, look into that that much, mm, but I know that --
R:  Yeah, well though it's been all over the news, I mean, as far as things that -- things that they found and things that he's done --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and people that have been suppressed for so long are now coming out and speaking about his brutalities and things, you know.
L:  Right, well that -- that could be true and I think --
R:  Yeah, we only -- I'm only going -- going by what I saw --
L:  Right.
R:  -- with their own people, you know.
L:  Right, I agree with you that, you know what, you know, you seen it in the news lately, usually think that it's true, and I actually studied journalism in, um -- in school and I know that the press has actually their own agendas and --
R:  Of course, mhm.
L:  -- they -- of course -- and they can't -- they don't know all -- all the truth as well, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and even if the -- if they want to go and find out, you know, whoever owns the paper is not going to let them to write everything that they think --
R:  No.
L:  -- do you know what I mean?
R:  No.  But why would these people get on TV and say the things that they say, th- -- as far as the Iraqi people, I mean, why --
L:  Um.
R:  -- would the Iraqi people say those things? 
L:  You know what, I -- I certainly agree that some of them have had probably, ah, bad experiences and if their family have been, you know, imprisoned or whatever --
R:  Yeah, and the mass graves, where -- where did they come from?
L:  -- they -- they feel like they should -- I'm sorry?
R:  Mass graves, where do you think they came from?
L:  Well, a- a- again, I don't know about that that much, um, I was just trying to, like, talk about the, um, the US involvement in the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in Iraq as far as, from what I understand that it's primarily about oil --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't think the US really cares about the Iraqi people.
R:  We do.
L:  All right, I don't think so.
R:  Yeah, we do.  Yeah, I'm telling you we do --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and, just --
L:  Well, I don't think Bush cares about Iraqi people.
R:  Oh, he's a good man.
L:  I don't -- I don't think so.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah?  No?  Why not?
L:  Because he says he's Christian and yet he goes and kills all these people.  I mean Christianity, all the -- is all about being peaceful and, you know, not harming others.
R:  Well, that's not necessarily true, +Christianity -- Christianity is all about following Christ, and Christ himself would tell you if he were here that if -- if, and I can't quote the bible, but I'm going to try to paraphrase it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if your enemy smites you or hurts you then you must turn around and hurt him back.
L:  Ah, well, I --
R:  You know, you can't, you cannot -- 
L:  -- actually have never heard that --
R:  but yeah --
L:  What about, ah -- what about the Ten Commandments and the not to kill and to turn your other cheek and those things?
R:  Um, that means, basically what that means is don't murder out of self defense, if it's self defense it's acceptable --
L:  Well, you know that --
R:  -- you know, if your child is being killed or hurt or someone in your family and you need to do something --
L:  Well, but that's your interpretation, right?  I mean we don't --
R:  Well.
L:  -- know exactly if that's what Jesus Christ meant.
R:  I only go by, um, what the -- what the scholars say, you know, that's not my interpretation, that's what the scholars tell me.
L:  Well, again it is very, ah, subjective, it's not exactly, um, said that that way in the bible and we don't know if that's what was meant there, right?
R:  No, it is -- it's pretty -- it's pretty explicit.  It really is pretty explicit, there's really, again, I d- -- I can't quote it but I just try to, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, learn -- listen to dif- -- many scholars and many different people that have studied the old testament and the new testament and in different languages as well, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and what -- from what they tell me, um, this is -- it -- there's really no room for, um, much interpretation, it's pretty explicit, but anyway, um --
L:  Mhm, I know I -- I -- we --
R:  -- I -- I don't know.
L:  -- we're getting in an argument --
R:  Yeah, we're getting in another direction, yeah, mhm.
L:  -- here, we're supposed to be having a conversation.  Yeah, I --
R:  But, um --
L:  -- guess it's just an area, like, hot topic --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a lot of people have strong opinions about it.
R:  Now Israel's another sub- -- story altogether --
L:  Oh yeah, of course.
R:  -- as far as -- I think what's going on over there now, it seems to be going in the right direction if they -- if they hold to it, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there's talking about establishing a Palestinian state as --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- well as leaving the Israelis what they have and everybody just has to back off from each other, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so lets hope that holds, because --
L:  I hope so.
R:  -- it would be wonderful, yeah.
L:  Yeah, but it's been going on for such a long time and --
R:  I know.
L:  -- I think that the major --
R:  I know.
L:  -- issue here again is that, um, the Israeli [inaudible] is just so strong in the US and I think that they actually control a great deal of what is decided, um, in the congress as far as the steps that are being taken in this -- in this process.
R:  Wow.
L:  Again, I think that it -- it is -- you know, I'm not -- I'm not prejudiced, ah, but I have looked into this, um, myself, I actually wrote my thesis about media bias and, um, prejudice and, you know, I've got -- I've done a lot of research about this --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and, um, there's a lot of people who actually think the same way.
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  So, um, this is --
R:  Fortunately the media in this country is -- is doing some sort of a turn around because there used to be a very liberal bias --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and there's just a lot of, um, stations and -- especially on radio that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- have become more conservative and I think more truthful but, you know, again, you don't know, you don't really know, if --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you're not in there -- in the situation yourself, then you really don't know who's right --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and who's telling the truth, who's holding back truth, you know.
L:  Yeah, that- that's true.
R:  It's hard.
L:  I know.
R:  But, um, anyway.
L:  [SIGH]  Oh.
R:  But I don't -- I don't -- I don't think that the US is out to get anybody, we're not after their oil 'cause we don't need their oil, you know.
L:  I think we do, because, well, um, from all the research that has been done in terms of the oil resources in the world, it's going to be depleted pretty soon and they're going to need those oil reserves that are in Iraq, which is the second largest reserves after Saudi Arabia.
R:  Okay, let me ask you this, well, here's a --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- here's an idea, here's a thought at least, um --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- if the Iraqi people are able to establish their own government --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and basically will end up taking care of themselves --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- their oil is a very good resource for them, for -- to help their economy --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you agree with that?
L:  Of course.
R:  Okay, so, why then should not the US as a -- as a major consumer turn to the -- turn to Iraq, the Iraqi people and buy their oil from them?
L:  Well, because --
R:  Is there something wrong with that?
L:  Because, um, um, well, what's his name, Saddam wasn't going to sell Iraqi oil to the US --
R:  No he isn't.
L:  -- and that's why US went there and replaced him with someone --
R:  Oh no --
L:  -- else that they can cooperate with --
R:  -- that's not true, that's not true, no.
L:  I think that's what it is all about.
R:  Well -- well, do you think that George Bush caused nine eleven, caused the twin towers to be bombed, to be --
L:  No I do- -- I don't think so.
R:  No, so, because that's something that you hear on the news too, that a lot of the liberals are saying that he actually planned that and caused that so that we could go after the oil in the -- in the East.
L:  No, I don't think so.
R:  I mean that's just way far fetched.
L:  I mean that, ah -- if -- if they planned that then they would have linked it directly to Iraq, right, why go in Afghanistan and waste all the -- 
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- all the time --
R:  And.
L:  -- so I don't think he did that himself.  So, but -- but I -- I really don't know exactly what happened there I -- again it's just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there -- there's a lot of conspiracy theories out there and I don't know for sure what happened.
R:  Yeah, yeah, and another -- another one that I find very, um, well, appalling, to say the least, is, ah, the fact that when the sanctions, the United Nations put sanctions on Iraq --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, the sanctions were not -- were only imposed on Saddam Hussein, they were not imposed on the people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the people were supposed to be getting food and -- and everything from the United Nations --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and what actually happened we found out recently was that, um, the money from the United States that was going to the United -- through the United Nations --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to give peo- -- food to the Iraqi people, um, was actually being held, if you will, by, um, Kofi Annan --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and he was giving kick backs to Saddam Hussein.
L:  Hm.
R:  Mm.
L:  Wow.
R:  Interesting, isn't it?
L:  I never heard that before.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I -- I want to bring up something else though, what about the, um, weapons of mass destruction, that was the main reason Bush was quoting as far as going into Iraq and getting those out of the way --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and they didn't find anything and, um --
R:  Yeah, they only found, you know, parts I guess, pieces of --
