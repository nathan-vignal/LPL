L:  Hi, I'm Joy.
R:  Hello.
L:  Yes, what is your name?
R:  Um, Susan.  I'm sorry, I can barely hear you.
L:  Where are you from?
R:  Oh hi.  Oh, West Virginia, I'm sorry.
L:  Okay, well I'm from Texas.
R:  Oh, how are you doing?  How's Texas doing?
L:  Well, it's hot.  We had a hundred and two today.
R:  I've seen that on the weather channel.  And it's stormy here.
L:  Let me -- what do you think of the -- right now in the Middle East?
R:  Yeah.
L:  What I think is that we really don't have any business over there.
R:  That's what I think too.
L:   Um --
R:  And as far as peace ever being -- I don't think it'll ever be.
L:  They -- they don't know how to have peace.
R:  No.
L:  They've been fighting ever since I was born and --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- hundreds of years before.
R:  Exactly.  That's the same feeling I have.
L:  And I --
R:  They've done it for years and they -- it's not going to stop.
L:  I -- I don't -- remember when Kissinger went over there, and he gave everyone a bunch of money, and ?
R:  Yeah.
L:  They were happy with each other for a while till the money ran out.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  And um, right now, you know, we -- we're -- we've got people going jobless here.  We don't need to be spending money over there.
R:  Here.  Exactly.  Exactly.
L:  But ah -- boy, this is really interesting.  We both agree.  What do you think about us -- ah, weapons of mass destruction with Saddam Hussein?
R:  Oh, I really 
L:  If they had 'em, we would have found them.  I just kind of wonder wh- -- if we didn't get sold a bill of goods and he wanted to go over there 'cause he was mad 'cause his daddy got shot at.
R:  I -- I -- I don't know what to think on that whole thing, 'cause personally, I don't -- I don't think he's -- I think he's still got his fingers in it somewhere, you know what I'm saying?
L:  Well --
R:  I don't --
L:  -- I think if he's been killed -- well I think one thing, when we went over there, we didn't go over there with en- -- enough men.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And if we -- if you le- -- if you bomb a site where he's supposed to be and then they've got, you know, two days to dig it up to take care of it, you know, we're never going to know.
R:  No.  No.  I don't think he's dead, myself, but I -- you know, that's me.
L:  Well he's got millions to spend somewhere.
R:  Exactly.  That's probably what he's done and where he's at.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, he could buy a country somewhere and live high on the hog, as long as he didn't ah, get flashy.  And you know, what he's -- he always was a home body, he didn't ah, [COUGH] fly around the world.  He just had gaudy, um, taste as far as --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, elaborate ah, spending money.  But I -- those people are -- to me, it's like when we're in Afghanistan we've still got people being killed.  We still --
R:  Right.
L:  -- have people killing us in Iraq, and I'm like, I -- I -- we're just -- we shouldn't have gone over there.
R:  I -- well -- I think it's kind of like, you know, the Vietnam thing.  We shouldn't have been in that one either.  You know --
L:  Yeah, we got suckered into that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we were into that long before they even let us know.
R:  Right, right.
L:  And when it started coming out, ah, you know, they lied and they lied about it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I don't know, I don't trust Bush.
R:  I don't either.  And that's funny you'd say that, because of where you're at. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, no.  I didn't vote for him.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I read in the paper what he's done --
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  -- in the State of Texas just before he w- -- wanted to go for the President's election, he gave rebates back to the high dollar property owners --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and didn't give a penny -- didn't even put a penny out for education or anything else.  He took care of his buddies and right now, the tax cuts --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's the same thing.  He's taken care of his buddies 'cause he's going to run for election next year --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and he wants them to put money in his little pot so he can ha- -- have the things paid for.
R:  Yeah.
L:  He doesn't care for us.  He's just taking care of himself.
R:  Yeah, and I think -- I think he's -- he's running off like his dad, you know.
L:  His daddy was a better man than he ever was.
R:  Yeah, but I think he's running off --
L:  But his daddy was a diplomat and he runs round thinking everyone just gonna love him --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and we didn't even elect him.
R:  No.
L:  He -- his brother[?] stuck him in --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and, I don't know, I just, um, I'm not really full Democrat --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but yet -- and I vote for the person, but yet on this, you know, I'd much rather vote for some of the Democrats than the Republicans.
R:  Yeah.  Well that's me.  I -- I'm Democratic but I don't -- I don't vote that way.  I go with who I think, you know, as a person.
L:  Yeah.  Well I read a lot and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I -- I probably, ah, know more about current affairs than most people do --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- and I watch a lot of stuff on Iraq and over there, and I'm just like, we are fooling ourselves thinking we can go over and declare peace --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the biggest peace we ever got was, ah, getting Egypt to sign peace with Israel.
R:  Right.
L:  And --
R:  And that's --
L:  -- what happened?  They completely turned over their country.  Their -- those leaders are no longer there --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the people, you know, so it's like -- and there're -- there're probably some Egyptians in those, ah, night team bombers that hit the World Trade Center.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And Osama bin Laden had a lot of Egyptians.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But if you're in a country where certain people have a lot of wealth and a lot have nothing and they allowed the churches to preach hatred --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, sometimes the only education they get is from their church, because the countries are so poor --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they can't send their kids to school.  There's not public education like here.  So --
R:  I know, I talk a lot on line and, um, I've talked to a lot of people from over there --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and from what we hear over here, it's like, totally different. [several inaudible words] as far as living conditions and everything else.  You know.
L:  My mother said that when she went over to Europe that sh- -- they -- she just couldn't understand why they hated the Americans so much --
R:  Right, and --
L:  -- and I said, "Because we're arrogant".
R:  Mhm.  To them we are.
L:  I said, "We go round and act like we're -- we're the only ones --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I said, "If we could --" and, you know, it used to be the ugly American was, ah, the Texas billionaire oil man --
R:  Yeah.
L:  So what do we have for our president?  A Texas millionaire oil man.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Exactly.  Exactly.
L:  You know, so we -- we are definitely the ugly Americans.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't --
L:  And --
R:  -- I don't know.  I don't think it'll ever end.  Like -- like you said, it's been going on for way before we were even thought of, and it'll still be going on to the end of --
L:  Well you know what, if they sign peace with Humas[?], there'll just be another group of those people will join.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.
L:  And I think, you know, in biblical times, there were times when Israel was allowed to completely destroy a nation, and if you really think about it, it's just like in -- in Ireland.  If you kill one, the mother raises the son to hate the person that did it.
R:  Right.
L:  So that when they get old enough they will go after them again.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it's just like -- and over in those countries, um, you know, it's not like they have the gene pool that we have here, you know, they don't have the variety.  So we're killing someone's cousin.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  And it's just like -- it -- it'll never settle down.  And even when they claim peace, they -- they had, like, what, three suicide bombings the next day and it's just like, when you talk to the suicide bombers it's just like they're proud that, you know, one of them was like --
R:  I know that.
L:  -- fifteen.
R:  That's sick.  You know, that is just -- it's crazy.
L:  They don't value human -- I don't think they value human life.  And part of their rhetoric that their priests are telling them is that if you, ah, kill yourself, you know, you're going to be glorified in heaven --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- and you're going to have, um, I -- I think some of these guys are going to be really surprised when they end up in hell.
R:  [LAUGH] I think basically they're in hell right now, you know, and they don't know it.  But I don't -- I don't know, it's -- it's just crazy.  You're really interesting to talk to.
L:  Well thank you.
R:  Have you um, been overseas?
L:  No.  Um, I just read a lot --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I've studied ah, French and German.  I can speak both, and -- and I get into different, you know, I'm always drawn to the person who's foreign in a group, you know.  Other people may shun them and I will go over and see what they think and how -- why they think it.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  and ah --
R:  Well that's a plus that you can speak the language, too, you know.
L:  Yeah.  Um, I'm pretty good on German.  My French right now is rusty.  My daughter probably speaks better French that I do right now.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  But her teacher's French Canadian so she and I kind of go round and round and it's like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- she'll teach her slang that I'm like, you don't use slang
