L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Hello.
L:  [NOISE] Hello.
R:  Hi.  I'm Susan.
L:  [NOISE] I'm Shirley.
R:  Hi.  How're you doing?
L:  [NOISE] Oh I'm doing fine.  How are you? [NOISE] 
R:  Oh good, thank you.
L:  W- where are you?
R:  Um, in Michigan.
L:  [NOISE] [MN] 
R:  Where're you from?
L:  [NOISE] Denver.
R:  Oh.  Denver.  Oh wow.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  [MN] 
L:  Where in Michigan?
R:  Pardon me?
L:  [NOISE] Where in Michigan?
R:  Um, do you know where Saginaw is?  Saginaw?
L:  [NOISE] Oh yes. [SIGH] 
R:  Yup?  Right in that area.
L:  Oh. [NOISE] 
R:  [MN] 
L:  Well.  What do you think about these high priced, ah, athletes?
R:  Um -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I don't think they should get the salaries.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I -- I -- you know, I don't know how you feel about it but -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I mean, you know, the working class person --
L:  [SIGH] [NOISE] 
R:  -- I think a lot of us work a lot harder than -- 
L:  [SIGH] [NOISE] 
R:  -- they do and we'll never get the salaries that they get.
L:  [NOISE] Well, that certainly is the truth.  I feel the same way.
R:  You know -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I just -- you know, because -- you know, really -- you know, if you play --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- like --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- ah, football, you get the summers off, you know, with pay.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  You know, they -- some of these players get more in one game than I'll make probably in a life t- -- you know -- w- I don't wanna say in a life time but, you know, when you figure it out some of 'em might get like a million dollars a game.  You know -- or som- like that.
L:  [NOISE] Or more.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  And, ah, that's ridiculous, you know.  
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] 
R:  You've got people who are waitressing or doctors or -- you know what I'm saying -- or --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- just the clerk behind the counter.  I -- I manage at a beauty supply store and I tell you what --
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] 
R:  --we have to haul cases and bust butt and it's -- you know, we don't have time to sit and goof around --
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] 
R:  -- and laugh, and you know what I'm saying.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Put in three hours and, "Hey, see you later".
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. [SIGH] 
R:  You know.  The whole -- tha- that's my opinion. [LAUGH]  They get paid too much.
L:  Well, it -- it -- it's mine too.  Um, I think that if [NOISE] -- if the sport is one that [LIPSMACK] requires [MN] just a whole lot of training --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [NOISE] um -- yeah, they sh- -- they should get a good salary.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  But some of these salaries are -- are totally outrageous.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] Um -- [MN] you -- some people would say, "Well, you know, the football players put their life on the line". [NOISE]  Um, football players would play football whether they got the high salary or not.
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  Um, yeah, some of 'em do put their life on the line but, you know, that's a choice that they made. [SIGH] 
R:  Right.  Well, it's no different --
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH]
R:  -- than like, you know, you're talking life on the line.  What about policemen and firemen and --
L:  [NOISE] That's true.
R:  -- you know, and everybody else?  And -- and they will -- 
L:  [SIGH] [NOISE]  
R:  -- never get that type of salary --
L:  [NOISE] No.  They won't.
R:  -- and these are more deserving --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- going into a fire [NOISE] than going out to a football field or a baseball game.
L:  That's true.  [NOISE] That's true.  
R:  You know -- so 
L:  Um, [NOISE] you know we, here in Denver, have many, [NOISE] many um, professional sports teams --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and um, [SIGH] [NOISE] the -- the salaries that they ra- -- that they make in one year would, [MN] um, take care of several families --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, you know, in a -- in [MN] -- maybe on a modest, uh, [NOISE] means --
R:  Right [NOISE] 
L:  -- but it would certainly be a lot more than some of those families would be making, um, [NOISE] simply because, you know, they -- they don't have the education --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- or something.
R:  Right.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um  [NOISE] 
R:  You know, if they -- if they are making that kind of money then, to me, they should have to put more [MN] -- more into the communities in their area or something.  It should be part of their salary --
L:  [SIGH] [NOISE] 
R:  -- requirements or something, because, you know, if they're, like --
L:  [SIGH] [NOISE]  
R:  -- you know, Tiger Woods.  Look -- look at how much money he's making from Nike.  
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Nobody'll ever spend that kind of money and that's not even -- 
L:  [SIGH] [NOISE] 
R:  -- part of the golf game, you know?
L:  [NOISE] That's true.
R:  You know, they should --
L:  -- [NOISE] it -- it should be almost -- 
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- a requirement, you know, that they have to give -- 
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- some money back or something, ah 
L:  Yeah.  I know that Tiger has a charity -- [NOISE]
R:  Mhm
L:  -- that -- that he works and -- and donates to.  I can't think of the name of it but I saw it in the paper this week.  [NOISE]
R:  Uh --
L:  Um, and I know a lot of them have charities that they believe in very much and -- and work towards.  [NOISE] But th- there's just as many of them that don't.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.  And -- and they gripe every minute about, "Well, I'm not making enough".
R:  Oh please! [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] Um, the Denver Broncos signed, um, a young man, um, to play football for them this, um -- [LIPSMACK] this coming year and, you know, he -- he's already been griping about he didn't get the money that he thought he deserved.
R:  [NOISE]  [MN] 
L:  Well, you know, he -- he's not that old and he's --
R:  I do not --
L:  -- not that experienced --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and why should he think that just because he's got a name from his last year's, [NOISE] um, football exploits, that he should be up there, you know --
R:  [NOISE] [MN] 
L:  -- getting salary rise with the big boys who've been at it eight or ten years?
R:  Right.  Right. [NOISE] No.  I agree [NOISE] with that [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and then, you know, and that [NOISE] -- and the same thing then.  The ticket [NOISE] prices -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- go up and everything else and --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, for the normal family who wants, you know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- who might have a couple of kids --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- by the time you're talking tickets [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- to a game [NOISE] for a family of four and then --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- food and parking. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, it's just -- you know can't do it like you -- you could in -- you know 
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  At least I know [NOISE] here, they just built that new --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like the new --
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- Colmere[?] Park --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- for the Tigers.  And before you didn't have to pay for parking unless you were right up front.  Now, you have to pay [NOISE] and it's like twenty or twenty five bucks or something like that just for --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like a car.  Okay, then you figure the ticket prices -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- then, and the kids, you know.  And the kids want food.  And the kids want souvenirs -- 
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] 
R:  -- and -- and it's because they're [MN] -- you know -- the [MN] -- the cost of the player goes up so who's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the one who gets penalized?
L:  Yeah.  And then they griped about, um, they don't have any fans.
R:  Right.  Wh- -- I wonder why?  You know.
L:  Y- yeah.  They bring it all on themselves.  I know, um, [SIGH] we -- we go to the, um, Colorado Avalanche games here --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- quite a bit and, fortunately, my daughter happens to work for the company that owns them.  So we get comp tickets.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But the price of the ticket is printed right on --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- the ticket and mostly they're like eighty four bucks.
R:  Uh, yeah.
L:  Now.  Y- you take -- and I see families there with, you know, with three or four kids --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  -- and -- um, sitting, you know, in the row in front of me.  Well, they paid -- they paid eighty four --
R:  Four. [NOISE] 
L:  -- bucks --
R:  Y- know that --
L:  -- per ticket.
R:  -- that's terrible. [NOISE] 
L:  And, you know, the food at the -- is not cheap at -- at any of these, um, [LIPSMACK] sports, um, [NOISE] places.  Whether it's the Pepsi Center or in Vesco Fields for -- for whatever or -- or --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- you know, where you are.
R:  Right.
L:  Food is not cheap.  Then you have to pay for parking, which is anywhere from ten to fifteen to twenty dollars. [NOISE] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, all of the kids want a souvenir.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Most of 'em that I see have on -- have on their favorite player jerseys --
R:  Jerseys. [NOISE] 
L:  -- the jerseys are not cheap. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um.  You know.  And -- and the price keeps going up.
R:  Nope. [NOISE] 
L:  I -- I think there ought to be a cap on it. [SIGH] [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, I totally agree.  You know -- depending on how many [NOISE] years they've been with [NOISE] them.  Um -- you know what I'm [NOISE] saying?  You know, I could understand --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  -- if you've been here [NOISE] for a couple of years, [NOISE] okay [NOISE] it'll increase to this [NOISE] much.  But for the newcomers [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- to come in [NOISE] and just get so much --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- money that, you know, they're not [NOISE] even proving themselves, you know.  They don't even know if they can cut it --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know.  Just because they were a great college, you know, [NOISE] hero or --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  -- whatever, they should not be getting that kind of money.
L:  [COUGH] I -- I heartily agree with you.  I -- I think that [NOISE] totally [MN] over all, that the professional sports players get entirely too much money. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] Um -- 
L:  And -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um -- don't see any end to it --
R:  Oh.  No.
L:  -- at all.
R:  It -- it -- just like it keeps increasing and increasing [NOISE] and it's like -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you would think when -- when baseball went on strike --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that they -- you know, I know they probably did for a while lose, you know, a few fans --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- but it's like they're right back at it but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, it's like they -- they don't learn, you know.  They should --
L:  Mhm. [SIGH] 
R:  -- be happy with what they're getting because they're only playing, you know, three or four months out of the year --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and it -- you know, they get paid every day whether --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they're working or not and, you know --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- to me it's -- [LAUGH] it's not --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that --
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- I -- you know, that difficult of a job, you know.  Granted it --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it is work.  You have to exercise and that type of stuff but I don't see it like, you know, people working, you know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- on fishing boats or truck drivers or, you know, construction worker, you know -- that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [inaudible word] gonna see that kind of money.
L:  No. [NOISE] No.
R:  You know?
L:  [NOISE] Not, um -- not even your -- your high priced, um, specialist doctors and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and things like that.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  Um, certainly the astronauts don't make that kind of money --
R:  No.
L:  -- and they literally put their lives on the line.
R:  Oh, exactly, you know.  It's just [NOISE] --
L:  [SIGH] [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know -- no that's just -- it's -- it's too much and, you know, it's just like you said.  Th- there doesn't seem like there is going to be an end any time soo- -- you know what I'm saying?
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  But -- but they need to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know.
L:  And, uh, did you he- hear on TV or read in the paper that -- that there's a thirteen year old out there in the world somewhere that -- that's just been given a million dollar contract or -- or -- or more by, um, [LIPSMACK] one of the, [NOISE] um -- I think it's a shoe manufacturer, um --
R:  No.
L:  -- I don't know whether it's Nike or who -- but he's thirteen and he plays soccer. [NOISE] 
R:  Oh please!  No --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- I didn't see that one.  I didn't see that one.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  [NOISE] 
R:  See, that's terrible and it's like -- huh no.
L:  An' it's [MN]  [SIGH] [NOISE] 
R:   You know -- an- -- and then the said thing is -- not to interrupt you, but it's like okay, now they see this --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- kid with Nike shoes that are probably gonna be in the --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- store for a hundred and some dollars or so.  Now, all these kids or whatever are gonna want these shoes -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and parents can't afford -- a lot of parents, you know, when you have like two or three kids, can't afford to go out and buy that kind of thing.
L:  [SIGH] [NOISE] 
R:  And then again, you know, they're trying to make -- you know
