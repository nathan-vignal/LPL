L:  Hello
R:  Hello.  I'm Terri.
L:  And I'm Sandra.
R:  Hi Sandra.
L:  Hi.
R:  Um, this is my first call. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] And this is my second.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, um, do we -- do -- the topic -- the question was, do we think that heightened airport security will lessen the chance of terrorism.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, I just -- I'd like to think so, but I'm afraid that if somebody wants to do something they probably will figure out a way around it.
L:  To do it, yeah.
R:  But, I mean, it's -- I feel more secure, you know, seeing -- seeing them, um, being more thorough, and also um, you know, having, like, the National Guard and stuff at the airport --
L:  Right.  But I don't -- yeah, like you say, I don't think it's going to prevent anything if they really want to do it.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, it's still -- they'll figure out, I don't know, they'll figure out some way, I suppose.  It's just -- it's kind of like, you kind of, I mean, I don't think anybody ever expected that September eleventh would happen, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but, and I just -- now I just ex- -- expect it -- it'll happen again some time but we just don't know when, you know.
L:  Right, just like with that one, yeah.
R:  You know, so I don't -- I have -- personally, I flew in August of two thousand and one --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and I haven't flown since.  I haven't flown since the --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- September eleven thing.  And um, my husband wanted to -- he said, "Let's go on vacation some place this year", you know, "Maybe out West or -- or something".  And I said, "No!" [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I don't blame you.
R:  "I don't want to fly!"  But, um, what about you?
L:  Oh, no, I haven't flown since two thousand.
R:  No?
L:  Yeah.  I didn't -- my bad experience I've had, so I, you know, I opted to drive versus fly.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um -- and after September eleventh, I'm definitely not getting on any planes.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm -- I'm with your there. [LAUGH] It's like, maybe we'll take the Am Track or something. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well those are not safe either.
R:  No --
L:  Now they're derailing.
R:  Oh, I heard about one of -- um, not too long ago.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But oh, it's -- I guess I'm just bound to sit at home then, I don't know. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't know.  But it's -- you know, you just, you can't reason, you know, we can't think what a terrorist is going to do next --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because they have no regard for, obviously for human life, but for their own life.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, you know, they'll -- next thing, they'll be eating bombs and you know, walking right through airport security and exploding on the plane, you know.
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  So, it's I -- I don't -- we're probably marginally safer, you know.
L:  I don't know.
R:  I mean, I would -- I would just like to think, just maybe a tiny bit safer.
L:  Yeah, because whereas they heighten sec- -- security in one area --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- one area's gonna go lacking --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and they're going to find that loophole --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- if they really want to do it.
R:  That's true.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then, you know, if they really want to do it they'll infiltrate the system and, you know, one of them will be a screener or something, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or working in the baggage handling department and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, so I guess if there's a will, there's a way.
L:  Right.  It's sad to say, but yeah.
R:  You know  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, do we have to keep talking about that, or are we allowed to ?
L:  No, you can just, like, the last conversation, we talked for about two minutes and then we just talked about other things, so 
R:  Oh that's good, I just --
L:  As long as you're on the phone for ten minutes.
R:  Oh that's good, see, here I am like, trying to think of something new to say about that, and I'm like, well? --
L:  I know [LAUGH] 
R:  Where are you from?
L:  Um, in Louisiana.
R:  Oh, what part?
L:  Baton Rouge.
R:  Oh, ah, a friend of mine, um, his -- his parents live in Baton Rouge.
L:  Oh really?
R:  Yeah, see I'm in Alabama --
L:  Okay, that's where I'm originally from.
R:  Oh, well I'm in Dothen.
L:  Okay, I'm in Mo -- well I was in Mobile.
R:  Okay.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Okay, so that's not -- that's not too far for you --
L:  No -- 
R:  -- I mean, Mobile to Baton Rouge.
L:  No, what, two and a half to three hours --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- depending on traffic.  It's not far.
R:  Do you know Tony's Seafood and Catfish place?
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  His --
L:  I'm about fifteen or so minutes away from there, but yeah, I know it.
R:  Oh my gosh!  Um, he -- his parents that still live in Baton Rouge, every year for his birthday send him, like, this giant Styrofoam chest with, like, I don't know, fifty pounds of -- of crawfish and shrimp --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- all seasoned and nice, and they have it Fed Exed to him for his birthday.
L:  Yeah, it -- they have a Fed Ex, um, service, yeah.
R:  Oh man, we get -- we were invited over there and um, I'm originally from Ohio --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- so I didn't know what a crawfish was. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  But he said, you know, just rip the head off and pinch the tail and bite it and --
L:  And that's it. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- man, were those good!  I made a pig of myself.
L:  Really.
R:  I just -- I just stood there and just chomped right on 'em.
L:  And here, it's like, everyday cuisine during the summer.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Oh, those were so good, they were seasoned -- they were just -- just a little bit of spice, but you know, not too bad and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but he -- he said that the locals, like, suck the heads to get the juices --
L:  Mm, to get the flavor, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] But -- it was -- it was good with eating the tail part, but I couldn't -- wasn't quite sucking the heads. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But we're -- we're going to New Orleans, um, later in June.  We're taking my husband's parents for their fiftieth anniversary.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  And -- they don't drive much, so um, they're in Florida and we're going to go get them and that's some place they're always wanted to go but it was just too far for them.
L:  A bit far for them, oh, okay.
R:  So I'm excited too.  Because we have a couple of small kids and by taking his parents, they go to bed early and -- and so do the kids [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, okay, and you can enjoy the night out.
R:  [several inaudible words] I said to my husband, "This could work to our advantage", you know.
L:  Right.
R:  We'll just take them, and then they'll, you know, nine, ten o'clock, whenever those things are done for the night then they can watch the kids and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we get to go to [inaudible] and --
L:  Yeah, there's a lot of see.
R:  -- you know, I've heard it's -- it's pretty crazy.
L:  Yeah, it is.  It really is.
R:  Okay.
L:  You see a bit of everything there.
R:  Yeah, well we -- someo- -- I mean, I thought, "Oh, Bourbon Street, do you think we should stay down there?" And somebody said, "No, don't --
L:  No.
R:  -- don't even " 
L:  Never stay in the quarters.
R:  Yeah.  They were like, "Don't.  You'll never sleep, first of all --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- "second of all, you'll see all kinds of things that you never thought you wanted to see." [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Mhm.
R:  And if you've got little kids and old people with you, you know --
L:  No, it's not good.
R:  They -- they said, "No".  And I said, "Oh, ah, how about over by the cathedral?" You know, because my mother in law loves churches and --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- um, they said, "No, there's a lot of, like, street performer types --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- "and craziness over there".  They said, "You best, see -- see where Canal Street is? Okay, go left of that", you know, "You'll be okay there." [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  So 
L:  If you, um, stay on the upper part of Canal toward the inter state you'd be okay.
R:  Okay.
L:  And then if you stay out in Metairie or in East New Orleans, you're fine.  I would never stay in the French Quarters.
R:  Really?  Just too wild?
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  Okay, especially --
L:  Especially for kids.
R:  -- you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- toddlers and senior citizens.
L:  Right.
R:  I don't need that --
L:  I wouldn't expose them to it, no.
R:  No.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  The friend from Baton Rouge, she's like, "All the transvestites come out after six o'clock". [LAUGH] And I'm, like, "What!"
L:  [LAUGH] They're in their own little quarters, like, you have to go to them, they don't come out into the main area.
R:  Oh really?
L:  You have to go down to them.  Um, Bourbon Street has, like, a -- it's not a cut off point --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but where all the clubs are it'll get real dark on one block --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and then you go to the next block and that's where they hang out.
R:  Oh my goodness.
L:  It's real weird.  It's real dark in that one block --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then you cross over and you're in another world.
R:  Oh my. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, it's weird. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well the night that we get to go out I'll make sure if [LAUGH] we go walking and it gets real dark, I'll just --
L:  Yeah.  Once you hit the block of Bourbon and Saint Peter, I would turn around and go back the way I came.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's good to know.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's real good to know, because you know, we'd just be walking along and have no idea --
L:  Right.
R:  -- what you're in for.
L:  Right.  I mean, it's cool, but you will see a lot of stuff you don't want to see -- I mean, you know -- [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I'm not ready for that. [LAUGH] So how -- how do you like Baton Rouge, as opposed to Mobile? 
L:  It's okay, it's about one and one really.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Yeah, it's no big difference, just, you know, geographical location, that's about it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  The pace is about the same, the jobs are about the same --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- no big difference.
R:  Yeah, um, a -- a girl at church lives in Mob- -- lived in Mobile --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- she's been here a couple of years now, and she said she misses, like, all the, she said, all the churches would have lawn parties and, you know, big seafood things happening all the time --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, here, we're ninety miles from the Gulf of Mexico, so --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- we -- it's you know, we don't have much seafood unless it gets on a truck and drives over here [LAUGH] 
L:  Right. [LAUGH] 
R:  But, um, she said she missed a lot of the stuff in Mobile.
L:  Okay.
R:  But 
L:  Well I'm there, like, every other month so it's not like I really miss it because I'm still there, you know.
R:  You still have family there?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh that's good.
L:  Mhm.  My mother's there and then the rest of my family's in New Orleans.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So you're about a couple of hours from each place, though?
L:  Well I'm about forty five minutes away from New Orleans --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and almost three hours away from Mobile.
R:  Okay.  I didn't realize that that was so close to New Orleans.
L:  Yeah.  It's not far at all.
R:  Oh neat.
L:  About forty five minutes.
R:  All right, so when I get to Bourbon and Saint Peter
