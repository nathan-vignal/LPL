L:  Hi.
R:  Hello. [COUGH] Hello.
L:  Hi there, I'm Sandra, what's your name?
R:  Hi, I'm Dawn.
L:  Nice to meet you.  This is my third phone call.
R:  This is my second.
L:  Okay.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Oh.  Airport security, huh?  What do you think?
R:  Well I don't really -- I don't really think that -- I don't think it can hurt.  You know, I don't think it's -- I don't necessarily think it's gonna -- I don't know, I don't really think that -- I think any -- any cautions we can take, you know, can only help.  I don't really [LAUGH] I don't know, I don't really 
L:  Yeah, I think that they'll help, too.  I just think that you can still get through there with stuff.  That's what bothers me about it.
R:  Yeah.  I had a friend of mine just come back from, ah, she went to -- they -- I forget where they flew to, but she said it was awful.  She said it was just really, you know, worse than she'd ever encountered.
L:  Oh.
R:  And I said, "Well, with everything that's happened", you know.
L:  Yeah, it does add up.
R:  Well she had on bib overalls and they even made her undo her overalls and drop the top of the overalls to see -- make sure she didn't have anything in the --
L:  Under the metal, yeah.
R:  Right.
L:  Or her -- her bra probably set them off too.  Beep beep.
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  So I'm like, you know, I think --
L:  My keys in my belt set -- my keys in my belt sets them off for some reason or other and --
R:  I don't fly, so [LAUGH] 
L:  No.  I got frisked before nine eleven so I'm really not even entertained by it. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know, I guess I was wearing the wrong clothes or had the wrong attitude, and automatically you get frisked.
R:  Right.
L:  I know they're just doing their job but it gets annoying after a while.
R:  Right.  And you, you know, like I said, I don't -- I don't think that it -- you know -- any precautions they take can only, you know, I think can only help the situation.  But I see why there are -- you know, why it's height- -- heightened.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, after nine eleven it's like they've not let their guards down.  Because who would have ever thought anything like that would happen?
L:  That's true.
R:  You know, I mean that's the most darndest thing anybody could have ever imagined.  So 
L:  I hope there's nothing worse coming.  You never know.
R:  Yeah, you don't know.  
L:  Do you not fly because of money reasons or because you're afraid of flying?
R:  I just don't fly.  I just never have -- I've -- my dad was in the air force --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I flew as a young child, but I'm a little afraid. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh okay.
R:  So.
L:  I've flown, but not very often because I don't have that much money.
R:  And aft- -- well money's the thing too, but after nine eleven it's like, you know, I just -- I'm afraid of heights anyway, so that's even more reason not to fly.
L:  Okay.
R:  We don't have family -- most of our family is around here, so we're wanting to do a trip to Disney --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- at some point, you know, and -- you know we had talked about driving, which is -- I don't know how far it would be --
L:  I don't know what state you're in or --
R:  I'm in Ohio.
L:  Oh, you're in Ohio.  Wow, I thought you would have been in the South, because it seems a little southern twang in there.
R:  Well, we're Appalachia, so [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay.  Well I'm --
R:  Where are y- -- where are you from?
L:  I grew up in New York.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I did live in Ohio for four years though, in the northern part.
R:  Okay.
L:  You know where Oberlin is?  A little town --
R:  What is it?
L:  Oberlin.  It's about four hours from Cleveland.
R:  Yeah.  I know where that's at.
L:  Yeah, I lived there --
R:  I'm in Marietta.
L:  Okay.  
R:  We're just right on the border of West Virginia.
L:  That's why the southern twang.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [several inaudible words] [LAUGH] 
R:  So 
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  Yeah, I have a friend that lived in Tennessee and I spent three weeks with -- I spent three weeks visiting her after graduation and I was like, you talk about southern, it's like everybody thinks we're southern but you get down there and, you know, it's ya'll and all that.  So 
L:  Mhm.  I don't know if I started saying ya'll when I was in Ohio too or where I learnt it from.  People have trouble figuring out my accent because I've lived on the East Coast and the West Coast and in the middle. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Where are you at now?
L:  Now?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, in Minnesota --
R:  Minnesota -- where is it?
L:  I'm sorry.
R:  Where -- I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
L:  Saint Paul, Minnesota.
R:  Saint Paul, okay.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Okay.
L:  I've been here for almost two years.
R:  Okay.
L:  And this place is totally different.
R:  Yeah, this is neat though.
L:  Yeah, you get to talk to people from all over the place and you have no idea who you're going to get connected with. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I came home from work the other night, I work as a customer service rep --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I worked until midnight and I came home the other night and the phone rang and they said, just a minute we -- we'll connect you, and it took like forever so I'm like --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and so I ended up just hanging up, I'm like, you know what?  I don't feel like dealing with this tonight.  I'll just, you know --
L:  Maybe because it was late.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You don't have to deal with it, either.  This is the last one they'll pay me for anyway, but mine will go unconnected faster, but mine are usually around this time, about ten.
R:  Yeah.  I did one at three o'clock in the afternoon and it went right through.
L:  Okay.
R:  I'm like, you know, because I'd told them, you know, like to -- you know, in the early afternoon would be okay.  I have two small children --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so it's like, I have to kind of work between taking the one to preschool and then picking -- you know, getting one off the bus and then picking the other one up, so 
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, that gets pretty hard.  I've done customer --
R:  So we've only got three days of school left, so  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh that's good.  I was glad when school went out in and they cancelled summer session [LAUGH] for me, personally, I mean.  I just wasn't going to make it. [LAUGH] I'd had enough.
R:  I have a friend of mine, she's in college.  She just started back to college and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- she's thirty four.  And she um, she was going to go to the summer session and she just decided, you know, what, I've worked all year and I've worked my butt of and I'm not going to do it.
L:  Well if you're going back to school for the first time in a long time, starting in the summer is probably the worst thing you could do.  It's really compact.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um --
R:  That's what she said.  She's studying to be a teacher.
L:  We need more of those.
R:  She's always wanted to be -- she's always wanted to be a teacher and that's what, you know.  I tol- -- I was the one that pushed her to go back.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because she says -- her son's thirteen and she was experiencing empty -- you know, kind of empty nest --
L:  He's not even gone yet.
R:  -- and I said, well got to do for yourself.  I know, but he just doesn't -- to the point where he just acts like he doesn't need her.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Now she's pregnant again.
L:  Wow.
R:  I said, boy that's, you know, quite a spin between them.
L:  Oh well --
R:  I told her that that's what would happen, because she and her husband had tried for several years and I said, you know, as soon as you get back in school and you get busy --
L:  Then you'll get pregnant.
R:  Yep.  So.  She's going to have another boy.
L:  Oh, I'm going to be thirty four in about two weeks and I haven't had any.  Hopefully if I do choose to have one it won't be too late.  My mom had me when she was a couple of months shy of forty.
R:  Right.
L:  So 
R:  Well thirty four's not -- I'll be thirty five in August, I'm thirty four, I'll be thirty five in August --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I said the thing with me having mine as late as I did, because my husband and I never -- didn't think we could have any --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, we'd been told we had no chance of ever being able to have any.
L:  And then something happened?  Or did you -- 
R:  Ha?
L:  Oh, I'm sorry.
R:  And we had, you know, we had bought our house and worked on our house and kind of just put it out of our mind and I told him, I said, we'll just put it in the Lord's hands and let him handle it.  And we were blessed with our two girls.
L:  Oh that's good.
R:  So, they're four and seven, and I said if I'd of had them when I was younger I don't think I would have appreciated them as much as I do now.
L:  Mm.  I don't think I would have patience for them when I was younger.
R:  I know I wouldn't have. [LAUGH] Especially my f- -- especially my four year old.
L:  Oh okay. [LAUGH] 
R:  There are days with her, I told my husband, I said, "There are days -- sometimes that when he comes home and she's not strung up that it's been a good day.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know.  She's just going through a not listening, independent thing and I'm like, you know, I just don't know how much more of that I can take.
L:  Yeah, that's pretty much my feeling.
R:  I love her, but she's just so much different than what my oldest one is.  My oldest one's real calm and laid back and she's just like a monkey on a string.  The little one is.
L:  Uh-huh.  I bet you guys don't start talking like this, and maybe it's because, you know, we don't -- even though we don't know each other we can talk about family stuff.  It's kind of fun. [inaudible] maybe that's why they want more men in the study.  I don't think men open up as easily. [LAUGH] 
R:  No, I know, that's like my husband, you know, that's -- he's -- he can't just walk into a room a start talking to people, and I have had no problem with that, you know, I mean my girls think I know everybody.
L:  Ha.
R:  And it's like, "No honey, I've lived in town all my life", you know, I've worked with the public since I was eighteen --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, I've worked in public places all my life so I've had to, you know, get over my shyness.
L:  You're going to hear a little click because I'm going to open the other extension because my cordless is beeping at me.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So I'm going to make sure it doesn't die in the middle of this thing.
R:  Okay.
L:  There.  Okay.  Because if it dies it's bad. [LAUGH] Especially when you want to get paid for the call.
R:  Right.
L:  Um.  Oh well, I've done customer service too and I really hate it. [LAUGH] 
R:  It's not so bad.  I work in a grocery store now.
L:  That's what I did for almost nine years.
R:  And the grocery store -- I work at Big Bear.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And Big Bear's having some financial problems right now and so it's kind of real tense and it's going to be interesting to see what happens.
L:  Hm.  Is IGA still out there?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  I used to bike out there and get groceries. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  We shop -- we have a little IGA and it's really
