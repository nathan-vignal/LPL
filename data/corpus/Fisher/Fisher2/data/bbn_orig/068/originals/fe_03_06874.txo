R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, I'm Pam, like Pamela.
L:  Okay, I'm Beth.
R:  I'm sorry, what's your name?
L:  Beth, like Elizabeth.
R:  Beth, okay.  Um, let's see, do you do much traveling?
L:  Um, in the past couple of years I have.  I've really probably traveled more since September eleventh than I did before. [LAUGH] 
R:  You're more aware of it, certainly.
L:  Yeah, absolutely.
R:  Because I haven't -- I have not air traveled in the last few years, so I have no experience with the security line.  Would you -- does it make you feel more secure?
L:  Um, it doesn't really make me feel more secure, it just makes me feel like there's going be more of a hassle at the airport.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And a lot of the airports that I'll travel, like, I'll -- I'll travel from a really small airport --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and people still think that they have to get there two hours early, even though there's going to be one flight leaving.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Or I'll do that, then I'll arrive at a bigger airport -- like, I've missed a flight in Atlanta before, just because about two hundred people's flights that were coming into Atlanta from the North were snowed before they came --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and then we got there and because of the new security, even though my plane was still on the runway, and even though it was twenty minutes before my flight was supposed to leave, I still couldn't board the plane because of the new security.  So then we had to, you know, get put up in a hotel by the airline and all of that mess and be delayed an extra day --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- on our trip. [LAUGH] 
R:  Is that for work?
L:  Um, that was for just personal but for work, I would say I probably travel about four or five times a year for work.
R:  What kind of work do you do?
L:  Ah, I produce theater.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  I do. [LAUGH] 
R:  How neat.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Are you a -- a former theater major?
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.  I really loved theater, but um, I -- I have fiber neuralgia now so, ah, it's one thing I can't do any more because after I -- after -- well, I've had it on and off for some years, but finally it -- it -- it came and it wouldn't go away, it got worse.  I did try doing a play at a local theater --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I was doing okay through rehearsals and then we got to right before opening and I went through a bad period, and as you know, unless it's equity theater you usually don't have understudies.
L:  That's right. [LAUGH] 
R:  And it was just horrible and I -- thank goodness I didn't have a lot of lines, ah --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- they let me sit back stage, even though it was very small, but I thought, you know, I'm not going to go through that or put anyone else through that again.
L:  I understand. [LAUGH] 
R:  What are you working on now?
L:  Um, I'm working on, um, developing communities, um, through the arts using arts to create tourism.
R:  I'm sorry, say that again?
L:  Ah, using arts to create tourism and --
R:  Tourism?
L:  Yeah.  Arts based tourism.  So I --
R:  That sounds like you -- like you're working from a grant.
L:  Ah, a lot of grants. [LAUGH] A lot of different grants.  State rep[?] and NEA rep[?] and um, just different things, but mostly what I do now is I go to different theaters that are starting this type of performance, using stories collected through the community to help --
R:  Mhm.  A lot of work.
L:  -- you know, small towns.  Right.  And all these small towns that are dying, you know, helping them to create tourism --
R:  What -- what part of the country are you in?
L:  I'm in South West Georgia, in a town called Corkwood.
R:  Ah.  I'm about a- -- about an hour or so outside of Los Angeles, east of Los Angeles.
L:  Oh okay.
R:  And, I -- yeah, in LA they don't have a -- I don't know, because I really didn't get into it, but they have a lot of theaters in LA because it's an industry town --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and ah, it was a real shock to come out here, you know, even though it's an hour away because in LA you have everybody paying for the privilege of being -- you know, joining a theater group so they can be in a play and hopefully some day a casting director will see them.
L:  Right.  And a lot of people that I went to school with at Alabama would always want to go to LA rather than New York, and a lot of them [LAUGH] are out there.
R:  Well, I've gotta say I was just -- just really, um, I don't know, just really floored when I came out here because in LA everybody's just fighting for, you know, a -- a place to -- to be on, people actually pay to be in art show cases that may or may not have, you know, everyone invites casting directors, but rarely do they come --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- in fact they don't even make it over the hill to north Hollywood.
L:  Wow.  You know, I've never been to California at all, and I've always wanted to.  I've had a five hour layover in the Seattle airport before but I've never really been west.
R:  Well it's -- it's kind of neat but, like I said, it's an industry town and LA has a kind of strange flavor to it.  I never lived in LA itself, but in -- in the valley.
L:  I've a few friends that live in San Francisco, so -- but a friend -- one friend of mine was leaving, um, let's see, he'd lived in Connecticut but he was staying in Alabama, and he was leaving to come to move to Los Angeles, and on the way there, it was probably -- it was August of two thousand and one, and on the way there they had stopped in New Mexico and spent the night, and um, he said he had a nightmare about those earthquakes that were --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] -- and he said he kept picturing those overpasses that had collapsed --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and turned all the way around and came back and then he's like, "Something bad is going to happen in the country.  I don't know what it is".  And then all that September eleven has happened, so [LAUGH] it kind of freaked him out.  So now he's decided to stay on the East Coast full time. [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, it's really funny because out here, ah, you can always tell a native Californian because when an earthquake comes --
L:  They don't even notice.
R:  -- oh, no, unless it's, ah, we don't -- we don't stop doing what we're doing --
L:  Right. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- unless it's over, like, a four point something or other, and you can tell the serious ones from the unserious --
L:  Right.
R:  -- ah, I remember working at a place where we had an aftershock --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, ah, some of the people from New York, I mean, they just literally dove under their desks or whatever --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and we're going, "Hey, it's cool.  It's, you know, this -- this is no big one." 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  They're just looking at us going, "You're strange, we can't take this".  I said, "Okay, okay, go to where you have hurricanes and -- and tornados."
L:  Apparently there was an earthquake in Atlanta.  Yeah, that's right. [LAUGH] We lived over on the, um, we lived on the East Coast for a while, and North Virginia and down on the outer banks of North Carolina, right on the coast, and gosh knows, we had a hurricane every time you blinked. [LAUGH] It was tiring. [LAUGH] But yeah, they had an earthquake in Atlanta couple of months ago, and --
R:  Oh really?
L:  -- I know. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, LA is just, ah, I think we're in the top of one big flat smashed [inaudible] so it doesn't really matter, you know, the -- unless you're going to move to the Mid West and then you've got to worry about, you know, hurricanes and tornados and there is always something somewhere.
L:  Right.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.
R:  And actually, you brought up a good point with airport security at the smaller airports it -- it's much easier than at the larger airports.
L:  We were flying from Pittsburgh back to Tallahassee, Florida, over the past Christmas and we had to wait in line for about two hours and it was early in the morning, and I mean, I don't know, I was in the air going to Pittsburgh right after my mother in law had died and um, my husband was waiting for me at the airport and that's when all of that shoe bomber that was on that plane [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that was happening while I was traveling, so he was freaking out because hold on, okay Abby, okay but um, he was traveling -- I mean, he was waiting for me at the airport while I was traveling, and that was being alerted and then they kind of ended up showing that my flight had arrived, it showed that it just kind of went of the screen. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So he was kind of freaked out about that, but it -- yeah, that -- all of that security has caused a lot of delays, I think, and a lot of missed flights and a lot of inconvenience.  I mean, I'm glad for it because I certainly don't want to be [LAUGH] you know, in that situation, but I think, because I'm one of those people that think that that sort of stuff's not going to happen to me --
R:  Mhm, oh yeah, nothing like that ever happens to, you know, you.
L:  Oh absolutely.
R:  It's always someone else.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] I think that's probably why it annoys me the most because I'm thinking it's not necessary on my part. [LAUGH] 
R:  Whereas my thought is that if I'm on there it's just my luck that would be the flight.
L:  Oh absolutely. [LAUGH] 
R:  Because sometimes I just have the damnest luck.
L:  Oh I agree with you there.  No, that's me too.  And like, what really gripes me is to see like, eighty year old women that can barely stand up, you know, they're always the ones that they make go over to the side whenever it's time to get on the plane.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, we know granny, you -- you've got cocaine, we can tell.
L:  Exactly, you're smuggling something, and they can barely stand up and they make -- they're wanding them with the little wand. [LAUGH] 
R:  I went -- I haven't flown in a long time anyway, because I -- I finally figured out, I think I'm afraid to fly.  Too many documentaries about, you know, planes crashing --
L:  Right. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- besides I've -- I've developed
