L:  Hello.
R:  Ah, hi.  My name is Phyllis Cordo. [NOISE] 
L:  Hi.  My name is Sheryl Baker.
R:  Hi.  How you're doing?
L:  Good.  And you?
R:  Good thanks.  [PAUSE]
L:  So.  What do you think?
R:  Oh, um, I think we should have a -- a heightened air security in the air- -- in the airplanes in the sky.  That would be a really good idea.  More the -- the more the better [LAUGH].  Nowadays, with things happening the way --  
L:  I --
R:  -- they are.
L:  -- I guess the question is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- do you think it really cuts --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- back on the se- -- on the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- incidents?
R:  A -- [MN] -- on the incidents?
L:  Yeah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, on --
R:  I -- I think the --
L:  -- on things happening --
R:  -- the more -- the more they -- they know that we have security on the plane, then it m- -- they might be less likely to attack, maybe [LAUGH].
L:  I don't know.  I think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it just makes them try to be more secretive.
R:  [NOISE] Oh well, er --
L:  You know.
R:  -- yeah [NOISE]. 
L:  I mean, if they, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- granted, if you didn't have any security, I mean, they're still gonna be secretive.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But, um, they're always gonna try to do bad things, you know.
R:  [SIGH] [NOISE] Mm.
L:  I mean, if -- if a person wants to do some- --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- are you --
R:  Yeah, --
L:  -- there?  Okay.
R:  -- that's -- that's true in a way, yeah, that's true. [NOISE]
L:  If a person wants to do something bad --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, people kill people everyday and they know they're gonna get, you know, in trouble --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and if they get caught --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so they always just --
R:  What about those, ah, people that kill themselves.  The bo- -- the [LIPSMACK] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- people that blow themselves up.  They don't care.
L:  Right.  Yeah.  Look at that!  I mean --
R:  I know.
L:  -- they're gonna die.  They know they're --
R:  -- [NOISE]
L:  -- gonna die, and they do it anyway.
R:  [NOISE] Well, I -- well, if they were like, to, a- -- approach a -- a plane, I'm sure they -- if they had a bomb on them, I mean, I'm sure the bomb detectors at the airport would know that. 
L:  Right. 
R:  Right.
L:  But they'll --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- find some way around that.
R:  Well ...
L:  If someone wants to do something bad --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- bad enough, they're gonna find a way around it. 
R:  [NOISE] I hope we can find ways to prevent even that [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Well, you hope.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  But --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, I don't think the security --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is gonna stop them --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- from -- from trying to do things --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Now the security might --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if the -- you know, the more security we have --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the better the chances are of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- us catching them.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  You know.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But I don't think it's going to, um, stop them from trying to do it.
R:  [NOISE] Well, I -- I -- I believe we should have a lot of, um, [MN] people in the plane that are -- know [MN] how to use their weapons to defend people and, er, all of their, er, -- providing and all that stuff in case they need to suppress somebody, you know, and -- pre- --
L:  Have you -- have you been on a plane lately?
R:  [NOISE] [MN] Oh, not lately, no. 
L:  No.
R:  No.
L:  Um --
R:  I'm afraid to fly, to be honest with you [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah. 
R:  [MN]
L:  Well, 'cause security is, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, is -- is really tight at the airport.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  And ...
R:  [SIGH] But you know, er, about a year ago, we picked my brother in law up who was coming in from, er, Miami.  And, um, like, anybody could just like walk in, into the airport, [MN]  area, the waiting area --
L:  Right.
R:  -- there was no -- 
L:  The waiting area, yeah.
R:  -- beep- -- beeper, or nothing to -- nothing at all.
L:  Right.
R:  I was really surprised about that.
L:  Well.
R:  And that was just, like, not f- -- too far away from nine eleven, you know.
L:  Yeah, but I mean, that's just a waiting --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- area, and, you know, it is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a pu- -- it is, um, a free country --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know.  And if -- if you get too --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- if you get too much security --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- then we remove all our freedom.
R:  [NOISE] Well, I -- I --
L:  I mean, you don't want --
R:  -- I'm all for extra security.  And this one I'm for [NOISE].
L:  Yeah. 
R:  [NOISE] And ag- -- again, it can't be well protected enough for my book [NOISE].
L:  So, you think you shouldn't even be able to walk --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- into the airport, without being checked?
R:  [SIGH]  No.  I think you sh- -- should have to be checked as much as possible.  I'm -- I'm all for se- -- extra -- as much security that's needed to be safe.  That's --
L:  So --
R:  -- what I'm for.
L:  -- to walk into the airport to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- pick someone up from the airplane --
R:  [NOISE] [MN]
L:  -- you should be --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- checked.  
R:  That's what I -- I believe in now, yeah [NOISE].
L:  And -- and you think that will, um, stop these terrorists --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- from doing their bad --
R:  Perhaps --
L:  -- things?
R:  -- perhaps -- perhaps -- perhaps [PAUSE].
L:  Mm.  I -- I don't think it will.  I think, um, --
R:  [NOISE]  Well --
L:  -- you know --
R:  -- what about --
L:  -- just like --
R:  -- what about -- what about that guy that, er, about a -- it was about a year ago that, um, shot of stabbed, er, those people that worked at the airport at LAX.  Oh.  Now, if he had gone through some kind of metal detector, something, [NOISE] or whatever, maybe that wouldn't have happened [NOISE].
L:  Or maybe he just would have found some other [NOISE] way of getting something to hurt somebody. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, we have -- we have laws in this country against lots of things.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Guns, you know, gun control laws and --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. 
L:  Um, all that does it stop --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, law abiding citizens from having guns and whatever.
R:  Well that doesn't --
L:  It doesn't stop --
R:  -- s- -- 
L:  -- the criminals.
R:  -- that's a separate is- -- that's a separate issue.  That's a separate issue.
L:  Yeah.  But the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- point is that --
R:  You could say that guy mu- -- the terrorist might -- might have been a US citizen and he could say [LAUGH] he was a law abiding citizen [LAUGH].
L:  No.  But the point --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- the point I was trying to make was that, people --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that want to do bad things --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- are gonna do them [PAUSE] no matter what we try --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to do to stop them. [NOISE]
R:  What -- what is your point? [NOISE]
L:  Like I just said.  My point is --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that, people that are gonna --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- do bad things.  Terrorists, whatever kind of evil people.  No matter what deterrent --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we have --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- people are gonna still -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- try to do these things.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That doesn't mean we don't, you know, that I --
R:  We have to find --
L:  -- don't think that --
R:  -- the best way we can --
L:  -- we should stop.
R:  -- to defend ourselves.  That's what I'm trying to say.  Very --
L:  Right.
R:  -- best way.  [NOISE]
L:  But you have to -- ah, don't you think you have to draw a line somewhere, where --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- our freedoms are being impacted?
R:  [SIGH] You say you -- you're concerned about our freedoms being impacted.  That's wh- -- is that what you're saying? [NOISE]
L:  Yes.
R:  Ah, in what regards at the airport?
L:  Well.  For example, you said that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you think that people should --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- be -- go through some kind of screening just to walk into the airport --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- to pick people up?
R:  Y- y- -- Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  So, you think [NOISE] --
L:  And I mean --
R:  -- you think that's not freedom, when they do that, right? [NOISE]
L:  No, I -- I think, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I think we have enough big brother already watching us, and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, we -- there has to be some, like, you know, assumption that, you know, we have --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- some freedoms to go about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- where we want.  You know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- now that doesn't mean that --
R:  Oh, you should -- Oh. [NOISE]
L:  -- the security shouldn't be on their -- ah, on the lookout for bad people.  I mean, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- people are on the lookout for bad people everywhere.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  You know.  I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that doesn't mean that if you drive down --
R:  It -- it -- it --
L:  -- the street --
R:  -- just very unfortunate these times are tough.  These are tough times.
L:  Well.  Yeah.  It sure is.  It sure is. 
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  And.  But, I mean, you haven't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- been in the airport.  You haven't, you know, flow- -- flown.
R:  [NOISE] Oh --
L:  So --
R:  No, I'd be too.
L:  -- you don't see --
R:  -- scared [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  You don't see how tight --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the security is.
R:  [SIGH] I -- I -- I've heard, er, I have a lot of friends that do fly and they say it's very tight.
L:  Yeah.  It's extremely tight.
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  You know.  And --
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH]
L:  -- um, [MN] that's a good thing.  I mean, we need --
R:  I would be --
L:  -- you know --
R:  I -- I would feel more s- --
L:  -- tight security, but --
R:  -- um, more safer, if you, er, if everybody was checked a- -- as people got in the -- got in the building.  That -- that would mean a lot to me.  Just to know if there was something wrong they could get them and not go in the plane, [LAUGH] you know.
L:  Okay.  Well what if you walk --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- into the bank [NOISE].  I mean, the people --
R:  [SIGH]  That's -- that's something --
L:  -- aren't safe --
R:  -- different.
L:  -- when they walk in the bank.  Someone could have a bomb and walk into the bank --
R:  [NOISE] That's true.  They are --
L:  -- and blow the bomb up.
R:  Of course.
L:  You know.  I mean --
R:  Well that's --
L:  So 
R:  -- why now in most banks they have glass windows.  It didn't use to be like that, five years ago [NOISE], or ten, you know [NOISE].
L:  What's the glass windows for?
R:  Security protection.
L:  Oh, you mean, so they could see?
R:  [NOISE] So they don't get shot through the window.  If there's a robbery, the -- the robber might wanna shoot the teller.  But they have that bulletproof glass there now [NOISE].
L:  Oh.  It's bullet proof?
R:  Yeah [NOISE].
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm [NOISE].
L:  But I mean the -- my point was is that you can't have --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- everybody check as they enter every single building in the world, you know.
R:  Oh.  Yeah.  [NOISE] Well.
L:  I mean.  A plane is one thing.  A plane's got to go up in the sky and its gonna fly somewhere --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, you know, so you definitely want to have people checked.  But to, say, if you walk --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- into the airport you have to be checked.  Then the next thing you know you walk into the bank and you have to be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- checked, and you walk into the grocery store and you have to be checked. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And, pretty soon you can't go nowhere, or do anything.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, I think it's very scary.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I w- -- I wouldn't --
R:  In a way.
L:  -- want --
R:  In a way it is, yeah.
L:  I wouldn't want to be checked --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- at every place I go.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I'd be paranoid to go anywhere.
R:  [NOISE] I know in some banks you have to, like, you can't go in the front door without, er, first you have to wait for the red light and you can't go in till the green light comes in.  [SIGH] And you're like stuck half way and then you have to go through another door.  And that's very scary.
L:  Yeah.  That sounds it.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I've never -- never seen that.
R:  Yeah.  It is scary.
L:  I think -- you know, I think, if -- if --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- we keep tightening --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- our security --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- and things like that --
R:  Excuse me.
L:  -- it's gonna get too far --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know?  
R:  You think --
L:  It's gonna get to the --
R:  -- you think -- you think --
L:  -- point where we're not --
R:  -- you think they're overdoing it, huh?
L:  Yeah.  We're not gonna want to go anywhere.  I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I -- I couldn't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- watch any of the -- any of the war.  It was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- all just too scary for me.  You know.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. 
L:  I mean.  This is --
R:  [NOISE] It is scary, war.
L:  It's a scary enough war as it is but to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- actually have to, you know, deal --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- with it on a day to day basis.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  People would just be paranoid.  People would be paralyzed --
R:  [NOISE] I -- I --
L:  -- and afraid to do anything.
R:  -- know, because, er sometimes, er, my husband and I catch ourselves watching a little bit too much of news.  Oh, we better turn this off, it's getting us all nervous.  So, we just turn the TV off.
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.  Can you imagine what would --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- happen if -- if you had to live with that everyday when --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when you went outside?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You wanted to go to the bank and you had to be checked.  And you went to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the grocery store --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and you had to be checked.  And, I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it would feel like we're, you know, living in [PAUSE], you know, --
R:  Well.  Thank goodness --
L:  -- in a fish bowl!
R:  -- thank goodness it's not that bad yet at the grocery store and the bank.  But, er [NOISE].
L:  Right.  But what I'm saying is, you know, if --
R:  [NOISE] But if -- if we had to do it, we just -- might just have to do it.  
L:  If --
R:  I -- I believe --
L:  Oh.  I wouldn't want to live in a world like that.
R:  Well [NOISE] [SIGH] 
L:  You know.  I mean, I think that we have to have some freedoms --
R:  Yeah, um --
L:  -- you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Otherwise.  Why we be -- are we in the United States, you know?
