R:  [NOISE] Hello.
L:  Hi.  I'm Julie.
R:  Hi.  Hi, I'm Anne.  [PAUSE] Um, okay, what do you think of airport security?
L:  Oh, well.  I haven't traveled anywhere since last spring, so [LAUGH] I don't know much about what's going on, um.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  I haven't, um, you know, been on a plane since, er, you know, since nine eleven but, um, from what I hear, you know, of the people who travel, um, say that the security certainly is heightened.  So, um, [NOISE] I would think that it would, um, you know, lessen terrorists attacks, um, if they're looking to attack us through the -- through the airports.
L:  Right.
R:  That's my opinion, basically.
L:  Yeah.  I agree.  Um ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  I had to even remove my shoes.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  Because, I guess there was something that was setting the little beeper thing off that they had me to take the -- my shoes off.  They had this thing that --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- they ran down me [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, well I --
L:  -- it felt like I was being frisked [LAUGH].
R:  I know someone who had to remove her under wire bra [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, my God!
R:  [LAUGH] 'Cause you couldn't have any metal on you, and, er ...
L:  Oh, my God! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] They had -- they had to bring her into a private room -- 
L:  Oh! My God!
R:  -- and ask her to remove it [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, I had no idea.  I never -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- even thought of something like that [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my God!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I was embarrassed to have to take my shoes off.  I can't [LAUGH] even imagine.
R:  [LAUGH] But, em ...
L:  Okay.
R:  Actually, I'm glad that, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, that the security is heightened, so as to make me feel safer, [MN] and, er, I think overall we are pretty safe to travel by -- by plane.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, but, what had happened on nine eleven was definitely a isolated incident, so, um, [NOISE] you know I really don't think that it has, like a, you know, that it really speaks for the whole, um, you know for the entire airport system.  [NOISE] So, um, you know, [SIGH] I just, er, hope that we stay safe [LAUGH].
L:  Right.
R:  I know I pray every night, so ... [LAUGH]  Yeah.  
L:  Oh.
R:  [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] But, um, you know.  Oh, there goes my other phone [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Let's see if I can get this one.  Ah, I'll just let the answering machine get that [LAUGH].  [NOISE] So, um, you know, so, where are you from?
L:  I'm in West Virginia.  Where are you from?
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm in New Jersey.
L:  Oh, okay.  I -- I thought --
R:  Yeah, I hear --
L:  -- you had a New Jersey accent [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  I hear a bit of a southern accent there, so it's like, I don't know if it's, er, the deep south, or maybe just, er ... [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Not real deep south. --  
R:  No, not real deep south.
L:  -- Just, um, partially.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].  So how is it? [NOISE]  Wait.  Hold on.  Yeah. [NOISE]  Oh, can you tell her I'll call her right back, honey?  Sorry [LAUGH].
L:  That's okay.
R:  But, em, yeah.  As a matter of fact I really would like to travel to the areas of the US, um   I've been out West a few times because we have family out there, and, er, yeah there is definitely more of, er the US I would like to see, you know.  I've never been in West Virginia.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Have you ever been in New Jersey?
L:  No, I haven't.
R:  You haven't, oh.
L:  No -- no.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No.  I've -- Actually, I haven't been to very many states.  I've been to Florida a few times, and North Carolina, and Ohio and Virginia and Tennessee.  That's basically it.
R:  Oh, okay [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  I've been to Florida.  I've been to Arizona, California, um, Pennsylvania, um ...  Actually, I'm originally from New York.
L:  It's -- oh, I'm sorry --
R:  And, um --
L:  -- I've been to New York.  I won a trip --
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- to New York.  Oh, --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- a couple of years ago.
R:  Oh, that's good.  And did you enjoy it?
L:  Um, well, I'm basically a country girl [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, it was sort of a culture shock.  Um 
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  Um   I just I probably wouldn't --
R:  Yeah.  I c- --
L:  -- go back [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Unless there was a lot of money involved [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  It -- it's -- it's an expensive place --
L:  Right.
R:  -- too.  You have to like, more or less, kinda know [LIPSMACK] where to go --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to not spend a lot of money in [LAUGH] New York.
L:  Right.
R:  And if you don't, you'll end up spending a lot of money [LAUGH].
L:  Mm.  Yeah.  We've done that.
R:  And there are the people who, er, you know, who were there, you know, take advantage of that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  They see out of towners, and, you know, they lure into areas that are expensive [LAUGH], so  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, [NOISE] but ...  I'm -- I'm actually originally from the Bronx.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And, er, you know, that -- that's city.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, it wasn't right in Manhattan, but, you know, it was still City, and, er, my father always worked in Manhattan and I worked in Manhattan just until, er, last year.  Yeah, so ...  I mean, I enjoy Manhattan, you know, but, er, I've lived out here in New Jersey now for the last seven years and it's suburbs and I really can't see myself going back to the city either.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- [PAUSE] that [LAUGH] type of life and, you know.  I say to myself, "Well, the City's good for one thing, but the, you know, other areas are good for other things [LAUGH]". 
L:  Right. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well. [NOISE]  So, um, --
L:  This is a hard subject to talk about [LAUGH].
R:  I know.  Yeah --
L:  There's only so much --
R:  -- we --
L:  -- you can say about it [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Well, I mean, [SIGH] what can we do.  I mean, it's, er, you know, personally, I was -- I was down around Wall Street on nine eleven --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- so I saw the plane hit and everything.
L:  Oh, my gosh!
R:  And that -- that was very scary, yes.  I didn't see the first one but I saw the second one and when that happened, everybody, er, really freaked out because everybody thought the first one was an accident.
L:  Ahah.
R:  You know, [MN] a bad accident, but then, with the second one, you know, everybody knew, you know, "My God, what's coming next?" and, er, you know, [SIGH] it was, er.  It was horrible.  And then I -- I went back to my job, um, like a week and a half later because there wasn't any air conditioning or water down there.  You know, no electricity or water for at least a week.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Yeah.  And, er, when I got back it was still -- it was still bad, you know.  I just, er, I just couldn't go anywhere near the site, you know.  I worked about eight blocks away and ...  [LIPSMACK] A- actually, you couldn't go too close to it anyway.  They had it roped off, you know, within three blocks from it.  You couldn't get any closer than Broadway.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, you know, it was horrible.  So, you know, I smelled the place burning for -- for three months after that and I saw them tearing down the rest of the buildings after that.  And it was -- it was very sad.  And, er, you know ...  [LIPSMACK] But, er, I -- I think the city is, you know, trying its best to, er, get back on its feet there, and, er, you know ...  Have you been to New York since then?
L:  No.  
R:  No.
L:  No.
R:  Right.
L:  I went in February before this happened.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, um 
R:  Yeah.  Well, I used to pass the World Trade Center every day, you know.  My boss used to let me off right near it, and, er, then I would have to walk the rest of the way to my, er, to my job and, er, it was, er, you know, it was something.  I just, you know, like, walked, you know, near it.  You know, maybe about fifteen minutes before the first building was hit and, you know, it's, er, something else.  [LIPSMACK] But, um, you know.  I just hope something like that never happens again.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.  Everybody, er.  I just don't see why there has to be such violence in the world, you know.
L:  No.  I don't either.
R:  People don't like something; you know, they don't like something.  So?  It doesn't mean you have, er, become, er, become an animal over it --
L:  Right [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, [LAUGH] it's --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- for no reason [LAUGH]. 
L:  Ha.
R:  No reason whatsoever, [MN] yeah. [MN] 
L:  Um 
R:  So ... [NOISE]  You know [PAUSE] [NOISE]   Yeah, you're right.  This is a hard subject to talk about.
L:  It is, it really is.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm like, "Oh, I'm trying here --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but I just can't [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  Um 
R:  Well you know I -- I pray for our troops now, over in the Middle East, you know.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm still not sure if that was the right decision, or the wrong decision, or, you know. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  To do what we did, but, [SIGH] you know, it's like.  I -- I just think we owe every- -- I think everybody feels we just can't be too careful --
L:  Right.
R:  -- any more.  You know, and we really have to watch ourselves, and, er 
L:  Well 
R:  Personally, I think if, er, you know, probably if we were a little more secure as to, er, who we let into the country --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to begin with [MN] [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know [LAUGH]?
L:  Right.  That's w- -- I think that -- that's a biggie right there.  We've let way --
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  -- too many people in here.
R:  [LAUGH] That -- that's -- you know, that -- I was saying it, like, right after nine eleven.  I -- I was saying to everybody, "You know, this may sound horrible, but we gotta really watch out who we let into this country" [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- 'cause, you know, and not letting immigrants any more that are just looking for a better way of life.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We- -- we're letting in people who, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, who totally disagree with this country and the way its run --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I feel that if they don't like it, they shouldn't even come. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know --
L:  I agree.
R:  -- that -- that's how I feel, because, you know, my grandparents came here from Italy.  [SIGH] But they came here for a better life.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, they came here to work and to, er, you know, try to build up -- you know, try to build something for genera-
