R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, how are you doing?
R:  Good.  My name's Alicia.
L:  Alicia.  Alicia, oh, my name is Janice.
R:  Hi, where -- where do you live?
L:  In North Carolina.
R:  Oh, I'm actually living in Manhattan, Kansas.
L:  Okay, Manhattan, Kansas.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  That sounds nice.
R:  Yeah, I'm definitely surprised I live up here, but you never know. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  So, we're supposed to discuss airport security, right?
L:  Right.  Do you fly often?
R:  Um, I would say I probably fly about once a month.
L:  Wow, that's often.  To me it is.
R:  Is it?
L:  Because I never fly.
R:  Oh, you don't?
L:  No.  I don't like flying.  I have flown in the past but now, uh-huh.
R:  No.  Have you flown since, um, nine eleven?
L:  No I haven't.
R:  Oh you haven't.
L:  No.
R:  Is that because of nine eleven?  Or you just haven't really had occasion to fly?  Would you fly, I guess?
L:  If -- if it was a dire need, yes I would.
R:  Oh really.  Oh, okay.
L:  If the only way, if there was a tragedy I had to be somewhere for, yeah, you know, like that.  Other than that, no.
R:  Oh.  Did you feel that way before nine eleven, or it's just since then?
L:  Yes, I did, feel that way before, yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  Mhm. 
R:  Ah --
L:  But the security part, I don't know.  What do you think?
R:  Well, I really don't think that the security measures they are taking actually make much of a difference.  Like, my feeling is kind of what they do at the airport is, to make people feel better.  Um, I don't necessarily think that, you know, if -- if somebody truly wanted to get on the plane and do that again, they probably would be able to find a way to do it.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah, because I remember, I flew, um, actually from Seattle to um, Providence and I went through Washington DC about ten days after um, September eleven, and there was -- I mean, at that point there were almost no changes in airport security --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and they were saying how heightened it was and it was probably the safest time to fly and I realized when I got home that I actually had, um, one of those little pocket knives on my key chain --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and they didn't even catch that, either way, flying.  So I mean, how -- how good is the security if I can do that, you know?
L:  Exactly.
R:  But, and then they do things like um, I guess, that -- I never -- I don't fly first class, but I guess in first class they give you, like, real silverware, except now they won't give you a real knife, they give you a plastic knife, but like, a metal fork and a metal spoon.
L:  Wow.
R:  Which, it just seems so silly to me, like, I feel like you could do just as much damage with a fork as you could with a butter knife. [LAUGH] 
L:  I do too.  Or more.  Or more.
R:  Yeah, plus like, you know, I think glasses, if somebody was wearing glasses and they wanted to stab somebody they could just take off their glasses and unscrew the little, you know, arm on it that attaches to your ear and poke somebody with that.  I mean, there's just so many ways that you could do damage if you really wanted to.
L:  Right.  So hiring more people for security and everything like that, I'm not sure that that would -- I don't think so.  I don't --
R:  Yeah.  And the fact that they had to hire so many people so quickly, I mean, there's no way that all those people are as qualified as they claim that they are.
L:  Or even if their background checked out that they were okay.
R:  That's true, that is very true.  Wasn't it like, they were saying that after, like, a few months after um, the attacks that a few of the people who had actually caused the attacks were given tourist visas or student visas or something like that in the US, you know?  I mean the fact that our government can't even keep track of -- of who they're giving visas to, you know, and then they're saying they're hiring these people to protect us, well, I don't know that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they can't even figure that out, how are they going to check every single person who's working at an airport? [LAUGH] But -- and then they also have things that I guess were, um, you know, you're not supposed to be allowed into the terminals unless you have a ticket.
L:  Really?
R:  But it --yeah.  So it's only supposed to be p- -- passengers that have tickets, but I don't -- apparently you can get, like, a little companion pass to go in, you know, if you're traveling with a child who, you know, is flying alone or if you have an -- ah, an adult who needs assistance, like, they're in a wheelchair or something like that.  Um, so I mean, what's to stop somebody who wanted to do some kind of damage, from, you know, getting their friend to pretend they're in a wheelchair and get the pass?  Would be quite easy to do what they need to do.
L:  That's right.
R:  So.  Yeah, I just, I mean, I think for the majority of the US, at least, it does make them feel safe when they go to an airport and there's, you know, all these supposedly highly trained people checking, and, you know, all these heightened security measures.  Um, it probably does make them feel better, and so for that, for that -- for that sake, I guess, it's probably good because at least there's not, you know, mass panic throughout the United States.  But I think if people really thought it through they probably would realize that it's not doing much.
L:  Exactly.  Um, I don't think that it would be doing much, as well.  Um, hm.  I'm just glad that I don't have the need to fly and I hope that it doesn't arise any time soon.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's -- I mean, it's definitely -- my feeling on it kind of is, well they did an attack by airplane, chances are they wouldn't do it that way again because they -- they're keeping an eye on it.  Um, but so it would probably happen some other way.
L:  [several inaudible words] on it the first time they tried to blow it up.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's -- I don't know, it's in- -- interesting situation, I mean, I guess my feeling on flying is it could just as easily happen another way.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, I guess, I don't know.  I don't know why it didn't -- it didn't really frighten me that much, when I was actually -- flew the week and a half after nine eleven, um, there was practically nobody on my plane.  It was just bizarre.  I've never seen that few passengers before --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and ah, so I mean, obviously it had an affect on the airlines, now they're all having money problems, so obviously a lot of people in the US decided that they didn't want to fly, didn't want to take the chance, but it's just such a sad thing to happen.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But there are things they do, like, you're not allowed to park, um, within a certain distance of the front of the airport, um, because you know, they don't want a van driving up with, you know, whatever, bombs in it.  But, you know, there's so many in Iraq, you keep hearing about the suicide bombers --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like, somebody could take their big suitcase into the airport filled with a bomb and you know, not care that they have to die with it and do just as much damage as they could from parking out front in a van.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, you know, it's just obvious common sense type of stuff and, you know, that's what it is, our government is too easy on foreigners anyway.
R:  Yeah, someti- -- I mean sometimes they really are.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they say that they do random security checks, um, you know, at the airport.  That they just pull random people out of the line, but I don't think they're really that random, you know.  Like, I've seen people on the website and that, you know, they're some kind of um, Arabic background or they look Arabic in some way, and they're always the ones that randomly get pulled aside in the airport.  So, I think that's kind of -- but I did see one time, when I was traveling that um, that I -- they were actually having people, like, pulled from their line and asked them to give them a number, and then they'd count, like, three people from the front of the line, or whatever number they gave them, and actually pull that person out.  But that's the only time I've ever really seen random security checks.  Every time I -- I think they're kind of like, oh, that person looks suspicious, or they fit the profile, or [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  I just don't believe that having that extra staff or anything like that is going to be any better.  I really don't think so.
R:  Yeah.  Because I've actually -- the ones that I've seen, like, there are more people at the gates, you know, or the baggage where you have to go through to the terminal.  Um, there are more people standing around there, but they're not really doing anything useful, you know.  I guess if somebody tried to break through and, you know, go through without having their luggage xrayed, then they'd be there to stop them, but most of the time they're just, like, standing around talking to each other as opposed to doing anything that would actually make a difference to the safety, as far as I can tell.
L:  I know.  I say, how many times have you talked on this phone?
R:  On this phone?  Um, I've done it -- this is my third time.
L:  Okay.
R:  What about you?
L:  Second time.
R:  Oh is it?
L:  Mhm.  I really like it, you know.
R:  It's really interesting, it's definitely -- what -- what other topics have you had?  Do you remember?
L:  Yes, but if, ah, you were given a million dollars not to talk to your best friend or would you, um, you can never, ever talk to your best friend again, never.  Would you take the million dollars or, you know, or keep your friend?
R:  Oh, that's an interesting one.
L:  I know. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh my gosh. [LAUGH] 
L:  Very interesting.  Plus my friend is there always.  There's no money that can replace her.  But, ah, this security thing, ah, man, I don't just -- I don't think I would even get a job myself at an airport. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  Well, yeah, especially if you're -- I just -- I feel like if you actually worked at the airport you'd really -- they'd kind of tell you how ineffective they were
