R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, I didn't hear a tone, did you?
L:  No, I didn't.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm sorry, who am I speaking to?
R:  My name's Pam --
L:  Hi --
R:  -- [inaudible]. 
L:  -- Pam.
R:  Hi.
L:  This is Carolyn.
R:  Hi.
L:  Where are you calling from?
R:  New York, ah --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- central New York.
L:  I'm in, ah, Chicago, outside of Chicago.
R:  Oh, my brothers both live there.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Mhm. 
L:  Oh, what, ah --
R:  Elton Grove[?] --
L:  -- in Chicago? 
R:  -- Village -- Elton Grove Village and, oh, what's --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- it called?
L:  I'm familiar with Elgrove[?], yeah.
R:  I can't think of the -- where my other brother lives.  
L:  Just outside of Chicago, right?
R:  Yeah, he used to be -- I -- I guess it's Algonquin[?].
L:  Oh, yes, I'm -- I'm familiar with that.
R:  Cool. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know really too much about airport security.
L:  Have you been travelling lately? 
R:  No. 
L:  No, but were --
R:  Not for several years.
L:  -- you a traveler in the past?
R:  Well, I did some flying --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just, ah, for pleasure, you know, I never did have to travel for work.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Do you --
L:  But, ah --
R:  -- travel much?
L:  I -- no, I'm not much of a traveler and, ah, I was just wondering if, um, because of the security concerns if, ah, that might have turned you off to, ah, airport traveling.
R:  No, it's -- it's a -- I haven't been invited anywhere. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] You don't come out to Chicago to visit your brothers much?
R:  Not much.
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  I'm originally from Missouri --
L:  I see.
R:  -- and --
L:  Oh, that's a beautiful state also.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, I've been there.
R:  We lived just south of Kansas City.
L:  Oh, beautiful, yeah. 
R:  Yeah, and I saw them, you know, when I lived there, 'cause my mom's there.
L:  So, if you were to visit them would you -- would you drive or ...?
R:  Yeah, I'd drive.
L:  You would drive? [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You wouldn't get on a plane?
R:  Well, if somebody was paying for it, I would. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I hear ya. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, the, ah, security, ah, problem wouldn't really, ah, turn you off to flying?
R:  No, but I have heard people talking about it and how much, you know, how much time it takes now [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- to fly anywhere.
L:  Right, I guess you have to get to the airport, ah, two hours earlier now because of that.
R:  Can you imagine?
L:  Yeah --
R:  Ew.
L:  -- just for a domestic flight. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, I mean, I guess the lines are long --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, and, ah, I guess they check everything.  I know a friend of mine, um, ah, I guess she bought a discount airfare to Las Vegas, um, and because it was so cheap, ah, they flew her out on one airline and then it was a return trip on another airline and, ah --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- they pegged her as a strip search.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Because, um, you know, it was two one way tickets --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- instead of considering it as a round trip.
R:  I see.
L:  And, um, that --
R:  I didn't know they did that.  I didn't know they went that far.
L:  Yeah, well, it alerts the, ah, air -- the airline or the security company or whoever --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when you buy an open end- -- or a one way ticket that, um, you know [LAUGH] --
R:  You might not be going back. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Right. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.
L:  But, I mean, they didn't strip search her, but I mean, they -- they pulled apart her luggage any everything, you know, and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- ah, they -- she was, ah, pegged or, you know, um --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- um, titled or, [LAUGH] you know, whatever as a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a risk.  A high risk.  Be- -- just because it was a dis- -- a discount, ah, ticket, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, she said, you know, the, ah, travel agent didn't do that, but the, ah, airlines themselves do that nowadays, I guess.  I'm not a big flier --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- so, um, I have in the past, but, ah, not lately, I haven't been travelling lately.
R:  I flew to Mexico.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I left Missouri in the middle of the winter and it was, like, zero --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I got down there to Acapulco --
L:  Ooh, yeah --
R:  -- and I'm --
L:  -- I've been there.
R:  Isn't that wonderful?
L:  Oh, it's beautiful.
R:  I met my friends down there and --
L:  Well, how long ago did you do that?
R:  That's been about probably ten years.
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  And we toured Mexico in their bus.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They had a big greyhound, they turned it into a, like, an R.V. 
L:  Oh, wow. 
R:  Well --
L:  So, they just spend their time travelling around?
R:  In the winter.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it was wonderful.
L:  Oh, wow. 
R:  We went clear up to, ah, Cancun --
L:  Oh great.
R:  -- from Acapulco --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and --
L:  Yeah, along the, ah, coastline there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And up through the mountains too.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It was neat.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then we flew back.  My hus- --
L:  Yeah, we did, um --
R:  -- one of my friends flew back with me.
L:  Uh-huh.  We did go up in the mountains.  I got a little bit scared because, um, there didn't seem to be any, ah, security or anything in --
R:  No. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know, when you get out to the remote -- the villages --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and I saw, um, I don't know if they were federales or [LAUGH] just, ah, you know, peop- -- guys walking around with, ah, these machine guns and --
R:  Oh, my --
L:  -- stuff.
R:  -- gosh. 
L:  And I was getting a little -- I said, "L- let's get back into a big city, you know, quick". 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  When we went, I had to take some truck parts down --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- or some motor parts --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it was just, like, a caterpillar --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and -- and the federales came on there to inspect the bus --
L:  Oh.  Right.
R:  -- and they saw those boxes --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and they got all excited about that. 
L:  Oh, boy.
R:  And w- when -- none of us could speak Spanish good --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- enough to, you know, communicate --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they couldn't speak any English --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and --
L:  How'd you get out of that one?
R:  Well, they liked me.  
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  This one guy ended up -- he was patting me on the head and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- smiling at me [LAUGH] [inaudible].
L:  I thought maybe your friends left you there with him and took off, you know. [LAUGH] 
R:  Now we were all sitting there and --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and trying to, you know, get them calmed down and stuff [inaudible].
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH] It was pretty scary.
L:  Well, usually, you know, sometimes they're -- they're looking for money too, you know. 
R:  Yeah, that could have been.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But that one g- -- the leader of 'em, he kinda -- he kept trying to get me to tell him what was going on and I pretty much did it with sign language.
L:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH] 
R:  And then --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and then he just patted me on the head and rubbed my hair and [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] Did you have any males -- 
R:  -- and they left. 
L:  -- with you?
R:  Yeah, just one.
L:  Oh, okay. 
R:  It was, ah, my girlfriend and her husband and then my other girlfriend and me. 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  'Cause we were both single at the time.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And -- boy, we had fun.
L:  Yeah, back in --
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  -- back in the good old days.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  No security either.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  When we flew back, we came -- we flew out of Cancun and went over to Gogamale[?] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that island -- it was so pretty. 
L:  Yeah, see, back in those days, I mean, nobody checked you in the airport, you know --
R:  No --
L:  -- it was just --
R:  -- they wanted to see my -- I think I had to take a birth certificate or something --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they wanted to see that at the airport and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that was it. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN]
L:  Yeah, same with me, you know.  They -- they really didn't, ah -- I didn't -- I mean, back in those days the- -- you just we- -- we --
R:  You just went.
L:  -- went where -- you know, picked up and went and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- didn't worry about anything.
R:  And it was cheap.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It used to be cheap to fly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But my boyfriend was a truck driver --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he's not now -- I flew to, um, Arizona --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- somewhere in Arizona, I can't remember where, and met him and then we went to California and up to Oregon in the truck --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and there just wasn't any security.  I think driver's license --
L:  Mhm
R:  -- to get all your vital information in case the plane crashed.
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  That -- and that was about it.
L:  Right.  Oh, it was a different time then.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I don't know, do you think it's better now, or ...?  Or was it better --
R:  Well --
L:  -- back then?
R:  -- I don't know.
L:  When we were dumb and stupid.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  We didn't know any better. [LAUGH] 
R:  It could have happened then too, just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, just as easy as it did now. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  It seems to me, like, but just the wrong person wasn't --
L:  Wasn't watching the ship.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't know.  I don't understand how people can get like that.
L:  Right.  Right.  Well, you know, they -- they -- they live in a different type of, ah, reality than what we do, you know. 
R:  Yeah, but still, killing innocent people is killing innocent people and it -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it just does- -- it just doesn't seem right. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  No matter what their excuse might be.
L:  Right, well, you know, they say that, um, how many thousands and thousands of their people have we killed, you know, and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, well, who started the first war, [LAUGH] you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- who threw the first stone?  I don't even know. [LAUGH]
R:  I used to work for the air force --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- back in the e- early seventies --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they were over in Iran and Iraq clear back then.
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  I had guys that went over there.
L:  Right.  
R:  I never --
L:  Yeah, but that was just, ah, for, like, security, ah, purposes or, you know, just, um --
R:  I don't know, I never did know really what they did.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It was all secret.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I had a clearance, but I didn't know what I was typing.
L:  Right. [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, I was just the secretary [LAUGH] and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it didn't -- none of it made sense.
L:  Just typed in the words, yeah. 
R:  Yeah.  But they were s- -- they were spying on people back then.
L:  Huh.  There's so much goes on that I -- you know, no one -- people don't realise --
