L:  Hello, my name's Casonia.
R:  Hi, my name's Brett, how you doing?
L:  I'm doing fine, hanging in there, doing the best I can. [NOISE]
R:  I'm good.
L:  How ya doing?
R:  [LAUGH] All right.  So -- so what was this, uh, question again, that ...?
L:  Well, they're asking about airplanes and, um, getting around, um, about terrorism and, um, people being in danger of being harmed on planes and so forth, [NOISE] like, the security situation.
R:  Yeah.  And -- and the question was, d- do we think that heightened security is, uh, helping the situation?
L:  Uh, yeah, it helps out a lot, I think, that it makes it a little bit safer and [NOISE] makes it easier on --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- each person to board the plane and feel more comfortable with it.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE] Um, I think, uh, I've s- -- I've seen a lot of, uh, what -- what you could call trends in, uh, in airports, in heightened airport security, that might make it seem like it's safer but on the other hand I really don't think it's doing anything.  If you've noticed, um, all the incidents that have happened, the security has conformed to that specific incident.  Specific example, I think most, uh, most significant would be, uh, the shoe bomber incident where they started checking everyone's shoes --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- for, um, explosive powder when the -- p- people really conceal it anywhere they want, you know?
L:  Right.  There is a --
R:  And I think that's a waste of money and time.
L:  [SIGH] Well, you know, it does drive the prices of taking planes back and forth a little bit more expensive because of the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- situation in hand.  It is getting to be a little bit, um, too expensive at times to fly back and forth, so I guess people are finding other ways of transportation, like trains or, you know, the bus, like, uh, Greyhound and stuff now.
R:  Right.
L:  We're pretty much switching over to that now. [SIGH]
R:  Right.
L:  But, um --
R:  Well --
L:  -- you know --
R:  -- y- y- you think that -- you think that if something happened on the bus, like, uh, someone blew up a bus, do you think that, uh [MN] -- what -- what do you think people --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- would do then?
L:  I think people would probably switch over to trains.  [LAUGH] They would find a reason to, um, get in a different situation in which they can transfer back and forth or -- the safest way to -- to go, I think, is just getting in your car and driving.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  I think so too.
L:  A- and that's bec- --
R:  But, um --
L:  Huh?
R:  I -- I think if people are going to use some public mode of transportation, I -- I think they need to take more responsibility and not just rely on the security of the, um, of the organization that's providing the transportation --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to [inaudible].  I think it's actually, um, more up to those individuals to, um, ensure the safety of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- themselves and their peers.  I mean, everybody's kinda -- kinda gotta look out these days, you know?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, you're right.  I mean, there's a scary situation --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you never know when something --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- bad can happen, when somebody can harm you or hurt you or whether or not somebody's smuggling something in a whole different way onto the plane, even with the heightened security.  Sometimes it is an inconvenience [MN] when you know you don't have anything dangerous on you, to stop and show them everything that you have and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, just constantly have things, like, if you have little things that are special gifts confiscated because it's not, um, you know, feasible --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to take to a different location.
R:  Oh, like -- like if you have your nail clippers confiscated because they, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they're considered a -- a threatening, uh, instrument?
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, you know, shavers.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, like, if you got a sha- -- you know, have like, little, you know, like if a woman shaves her legs, but I don't shave my legs, but I'm just saying for --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- other women that do, 'cause I don't have any hair, so ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You know what I mean?  So, it's like, you know, but I know a lotta women that shave their legs and underneath their armpits and things like that, so ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know --
R:  Yeah, I don't know --
L:  -- they need that.
R:  -- I think i- if anyone threatened me with a -- a shaving device --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think I'd probably die of laughter before they could, uh --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- cut me up in that amount of time! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's true.  [LAUGH]  That does make a lotta sense, you're absolutely right, you're positively right about that.
R:  But -- but the first thing you said raised a valid point, that, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that, uh, I think it's true that people need to feel safe --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but, um, uh, doing it by creating an illusion I -- I don't think is the right solution.  I don't think our government is realistic enough.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I think at some point they really have to say, um, you know, w- w- you -- people need to take more responsibility for themselves and be more alert.  This isn't the same as it's been, things are different now.
L:  But I think that sometimes people wanna commit suicide, and they don't care who they take with them, and --
R:  Yeah, but what are you -- but what are you gonna do other than get real about it?  You know?  What can you do?
L:  Well --
R:  I mean --
L:  Well, I can drive. [LAUGH]  And then they --
R:  Yeah, y- uh -- yeah.
L:  -- can lose money.
R:  True.
L:  And then they'll have to close up all the airports.
R:  True.
L:  But I think that sometimes they put the security there to make people feel safe, so that where they can keep the business going, so they can keep, um, making a certain income per year.
R:  I agree.
L:  And that income that they really need to have in their pockets.
R:  Yeah.  I agree.
L:  [MN] Yeah?  Oh, aren't you sweet!
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, that's a nice --
R:  But -- but do you -- do you really think that it really does make it safer, um, I wouldn't agree with that, though.  Like, I think it's --
L:  Well, sometimes I feel really scared when I see pe- a beeper going off and I see people carrying knives that are like, you know, twelve inches long, you know, and, uh, just, you know, like guns, concealed guns.  I mean, why is it that a cop gets to take their gun with them?  You know?  How do you know the cop isn't gonna flip out and kill everybody on the plane or ...?  It's not a suicidal cop or something?
R:  Well, have you, uh-huh --
L:  You know, why are -- are the cop allowed to go on a plane and take their weapon with them.
R:  I can understand that because maybe, you know, a postal employee, but, you know, a -- I -- I've -- I don't think I've ever heard of a -- of a cop going crazy on an airplane and shooting people, so I, you know, I feel [MN] --
L:  But you never know, it could happen, a cop could flip out and turn out to be a weirdo and injure a bunch of people on the plane and --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- you know, be like, on a suicidal thing like, you know -- you never know.  But why are they allowed to carry guns, and then their handcuffs, and then the keys that go with it.  
R:  [MN]
L:  You know, why -- why is it that they get to do it?
R:  Well, 'cause if somebody -- if a terrorist snuck a weapon on board and no one had -- had any kind of, you know, weapons, you know, the people would probably be grateful that there was a cop there with a gun, right?
L:  Well, yeah, but that'd be good, I mean, but, you know, a terrorist, how can -- you know, how do the terrorists get past the gate anyway to begin with?  How is it that they didn't recognize the guns to begin with?  If -- especially if you're having all your stuff scanned and then you're going through a -- a certain area in which, you know, they can detect metal on you.  How did the terrorists get on there to begin with?  [NOISE]  Unless somebody who was terrorist working at the airport, who let them fly through.
R:  Well, I mean, maybe, um --
L:  You know --
R:  -- maybe box cutters weren't, uh, considered a, um, you know, dangerous weapon.  Also, you got -- you gotta think, when they do an X. ray and the box cutter is sheathed, it's inside this little thing and it doesn't look like a weapon 'cause all you see is a rectangle, in the X. ray.  So --
L:  But a rectangle should still be taken out and +observed.
R:  Well, I mean, there's a lot of metal things in someone's bag, and not all of 'em look suspicious, you know?
L:  But they [MN] --
R:  I mean, it -- it could be a -- could look like a pack of gum, you know?  I mean --
L:  So, what did they have, something that's shaped like a gu- -- a gum?  I mean, anything that's metal, I think that they should just bring it out, look at it, analyze it, and, uh, just confiscate it if it's not, um, allowed to go to a other state, they should --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just take it away, but they're not gonna do that.
R:  [MN] They -- they -- they're -- they're getting better at it now, I think.  Um, I mean, I've -- I've had my bag checked about a million times, and I didn't think there was anything suspicious looking in there, but apparently they saw something, um [LIPSMACK] --
L:  W- --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, that's a freak -- that's freaky, that's very freaky, to have something like that occur.  Yeah, I mean, how'd you feel when they did something like that to you?
R:  Oh, I mean, I was pretty understanding about it.  Um, they weren't threatening to me at all.  I mean, if they would've acted like, um -- I mean, if they would've been really rude about it, I probably would've said something, but then again I could've been detained for saying something, so I might've just kept my mouth shut.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  But, um, yeah, they're -- they're -- they're pretty -- they're pretty good about it.
L:  Oh, they're just wonderful.
R:  Uh, at least they take their job seriously, you know?
L:  Well, that's the -- that makes me feel better.  Maybe I'll start getting on planes again, I haven't been on the plane since I heard about some guy who was giving his life to Allah, what did he call, what did he call?  The God.
R:  Yeah, yeah, Allah, right.
L:  Oh yeah, he wanted to kill everybody. [NOISE]  You know, since that night, uh, ten forty, um, excuse me, uh, what do you call that thing that happened?  Nine eleven.
R:  [MN] yeah.
L:  After that, I don't know, I haven't been on a plane since.  You know?  It's like I just have this fear now, of doing something like that.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But, I don't know, I [LIPSMACK] security, I don't know if it's gonna get better.  I don't know, it's -- the -- the prices are starting to get outrageous.  I think those other companies that are going with a lower price to try to get people to get suckered in, right?
R:  Mhm.
L:  So it's starting to change in a way.
R:  Mm.
L:  Because they're starting to lose business, you know?  Like, the major ones are.
R:  I- it's pretty remarkable, um, a friend of mine was on a flight and, uh, it was a, um, a North West -- I'm sorry, South West Air flight -- and they, um, and the pilot gave
