R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  My name is William.  I didn't quite understand what the topic was about.  I couldn't quite hear, did you know?
L:  Um, my name's Barbara, first of all.  And the topic, um, if I heard it correctly was whether we believe that the high level security at airports is really helping to make them more secure.
R:  Oh, about high level of security, do I know -- well, yes, I think in some instances it does help, maybe sometimes it might be, uh, a little aggravating sometime or inconvenience so that's -- but, uh, what -- what is your idea about the situation?
L:  Well, I've flown three times to Europe since, uh, September eleventh and, um, some of the new security is very reassuring, some of it I find is just absurd.  Um, y- you know, in the sense of it- it's --
R:  Yes, ma'am.
L:  -- you know, they- they're targeting people that it's just really ridiculous and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and other times I'm wondering why they're not targeting other people and I'm not talking about ethnic or racial or anything like that.
R:  No.
L:  I'm just talking about, um, [MN] you know, the woman with a baby stroller --
R:  Oh yeah, yeah.
L:  -- versus -- versus, um, three, um, strapping young men, you know [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Al- although it's possible I'm sure for people to, uh, smuggle things on --
R:  All right.
L:  -- in a baby stroller.  But, um, you know, some of that I just question.
R:  What is -- what -- what is, uh -- what do you think about is the -- is the security more, uh, I don't now what the right word to use is, more strict here in the United States than it is, say, in Europe when you're boarding or ...?
L:  I --
R:  And maybe you, uh, you know.
L:  Well, I -- I think it gives the impression of being safer but I think a lot of what we're assuming is high security is just visible security when, in fact, I just read an article in a magazine that, uh, a customs agent was fired because she had reported how easy it was for people to have access to planes --
R:  Definitely.
L:  -- on the ground who were not even checked, uh, at all because they had jobs that were subcontracted out --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, you know, for people, you know, supplying food or maintenance to the aircraft and those people didn't go through what passengers went through, they went through a side gate where there was no check of IDs or anything.
R:  Huh, is that right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you think it -- it's, uh, well I don't want -- is -- is too much, like too tight on security for passengers or should be tighter or what's you- what's your idea on that situation?
L:  Well, I -- I don't think it's a question of being tighter or not I think it's a question of, uh, what they're doing, uh, if they're gonna be really tight checking my passport and ID and everything that's fine but while they're doing that I think they should be checking employees who go to work at the airport everyday.
R:  Well, that's true too, they have quicker access to -- I don't know, like, to smuggle something on than just a passenger evidently, right?
L:  Yeah.  And if people who are up to no good find out about these security lapses, what's to stop them from, um, going in the same way as if they were an employee.
R:  Mm.
L:  I mean, I don't believe that em- employees are any more likely to -- I mean, I think they're less likely to do something actually but it's not -- it's not them I'm worried about, it's people who find out about these, uh --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- ways to get on.
R:  When -- when you're flying have you ever been on a plane that's been hijacked or whatever you wanna call it?
L:  No, no, no [MN].
R:  Did you say, "No?"
L:  Pardon me.
R:  What -- I don't understand what you said.
L:  No, I haven't, no.
R:  Oh, huh.
L:  No.
R:  Like, uh, what part of the United States you live in?
L:  I live in New York City.
R:  In New York.  I've been to New York.  It's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the best place.  I live in Mississippi.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And --
L:  I could never tell from your accent. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I bet, I bet, really.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You probably don't think I'm ever gonna get a word out, it's long drawn out, right?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, we have a -- a friend there in New York but I don't --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- she, uh, she works for the transit things, she paints pictures down in the, what do you call those train right up in New York?
L:  In the subway?
R:  Subway.  She -- she's the lady that paints pictures down in -- in those subways stuff like that.  But we're going back to your question about security in airports, I wonder if they -- uh, do the -- the people at airports check the liability of employees real close before they give 'em a job and I feel sure they do though, don't you -- don't you think?
L:  Well, that's what I'm not so sure about.  
R:  Mm.
L:  'Cause look at they've discovered that these people that they've hired to do the screening because they were -- they were rushing to hire more of them after September eleventh that they haven't really screened them very well.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, I mean, I remember a long time ago when there was a lot of hijacking going on and I was travelling in France and, um, it was interesting because I was travelling on a flight within France on a small airline and they were searching everyone, body searches --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they had, um, l- like a curtain on each side and the women would go behind the curtain on one side and men on the other and they would have a -- a security officer, either male or female, pat the people down.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I felt real good that [LAUGH] let me tell you.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  With the number of planes that were being hijacked at that time and I remember there were two Americans behind me complaining about their privacy and I said, "Well, if you -- if they didn't do this and something happened you'd be complaining about the lack of security". [LAUGH]
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  You know, so --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I mean, I don't mind as long as it's consistent, you know, as long as it makes sense and that made sense to me they -- I know I didn't feel that my privacy was being violated, it was, you know, it was not in front of people or anything and -- and, uh, they were very courteous about it.
R:  Uh --
L:  And that was fine, you know.
R:  Do you feel safer now when you board one, of airplanes, than -- than you used to or not?
L:  Um --
R:  Or about the same or ...
L:  I guess about the same.  I always felt pretty safe.  I mean, still the odds of being hijacked are very, very low.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um --
R:  And -- and so you fly -- how often did you say you fly?
L:  Well, just because of situation I flew pretty often in the last two years but, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I probably won't be for a while.  But how about yourself?
R:  Ma'am, I don't I will -- we flew to New York --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, uh, flew twice to, uh, Las Vegas and of course that wasn't a real -- this wasn't a commercial plane just, uh, you know, [inaudible] plane and several heli- helicopters -- helicopters and that's about the extent of my flying. [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.
R:  Uh, my job -- I work -- even though I work for the s- the State of Mississippi but it don't involve any flying that -- that plane[?].
L:  Mhm.
R:  But do you work for the State of New York or something?
L:  No, no, not at all.
R:  Mhm.
L:  No.
R:  You're originally from -- originally from New York?
L:  I'm originally from Philadelphia.
R:  [inaudible] all right.
L:  Not Mississippi, M- Pennsylvania. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I'm saying I -- I --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- where -- where you're born, I can tell that --
L:  See I know my geography a little bit. [LAUGH]
R:  I don't [inaudible] to -- two of the four from Philadelphia, Mississippi.
L:  Mm.  I've --
R:  And --
L:  -- I've been -- only driving through Mississippi many years ago.  I never actually stopped.  Just going from Georgia to Alabama.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I just remember not seeing very many people but lots of farms and -- and beautiful farmland.
R:  Oh yeah, that's -- we're one for agriculture, Mississippi, have to get out of the [several inaudible words].
L:  Mhm.
R:  We -- where I live, uh, I -- I'll tell you a little -- are you old enough to know about the song about Billy Jo jumping off the Tallahassee Bridge and hurt herself.
L:  Sure, yeah. 
R:  I live in the county, I don't live too far from --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- where that bridge was.
L:  Wow.
R:  But it's nothing there anymore it's no -- it's not even, uh, site there, anymore.  But, like, they would have made it a sort of historical site or something.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's -- it's not anything to it but just a song made --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- Tallahassee County a little bit famous anyway.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, yeah.  Well --
R:  And no -- 'cause what -- what type do you work -- work do you do, uh ...?
L:  Um, I work in theater.  And I was --
R:  In theater?
L:  In theater, yes.  As a playwright and a director and an actor.
R:  Oh, that's great.
L:  Yeah.  So, I was doing a tour down south, um, a lot time ago and we -- we, uh, were traveling by car --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- between places and, uh, I remember driving through Mississippi.
R:  Have you been in this business a long while?
L:  Since I was a child, yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, so it's, uh --
R:  Like that -- I wanna ask you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like it's -- I'm looking at my watch, it's twenty minutes to three right now in Mississippi, what time is it in New York?
L:  Exactly the same.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Oh no, twenty minutes to four, I'm sorry.
R:  Oh yeah, you're an hour ahead of us.
L:  Oh yeah, we're an hour ahead, yeah -- yeah.  Um, but getting back to the -- the topic a little bit I remember I had visitors from Europe right after September eleventh and, um ...
