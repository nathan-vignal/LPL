L:  Hi, I'm --
R:  [MN]
L:  Jennifer Munn.
R:  Hi, I'm Rebecca.
L:  [LAUGH] Hi!  Kinda weird, eh?
R:  Yeah [LAUGH]
L:  Um, gosh, the ah, er, airline security -- I don't know I think it probably does lessen the likelihood of [NOISE] an attack.  I can't say that I think that it completely out -- you know, completely can eliminate it, but 
R:  Right.  Um, I haven't flown since, uh, gosh, probably nineteen ninety eight [LAUGH].
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So 
L:  Well, you know, actually I don't think I [SIGH] -- nineteen ninety nine maybe for me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So 
R:  I -- I don't actually know all the security measures that they're taking.
L:  No.
R:  I [MN] --
L:  But --
R:  I would -- I would think that anything was an improvement over how it was before.  It at least lessons the probability somehow.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, I don't know! [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I think my, um, I mean, -- how do I say this?  I- -- [LIPSMACK] these are people that, like, it -- with -- with nine eleven th- they -- they knew how the airlines worked and stuff.  They'd gone through f- -- like some of them anyway had gone to the flight schools and stuff.
R:  Right.
L:  So   They we- -- it was some ways like an inside job, plus, I don't wanna sound racist or anything, but, I mean, I know that when I flew out of Seattle there were a lot of people that looked like they were of, um, foreign descent.
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- You know what I'm saying [LAUGH]?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Seems like all you'd have to do was slip a twenty to the right person and [LAUGH] they'll let you through, maybe.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, if you had a buddy.  So, it seems like there's still probably is the opportunity for that kind of thing to go on.
R:  So, maybe they need to be m- -- a little more careful who they hire to do the security too.
L:  We- -- ah, maybe, I -- you know, --
R:  Um 
L:  -- I don't know what the procedures are.  But, you know, one experience I had when I did fly, I think in nineteen ninety nine, um, [LIPSMACK] they did a hand search of my purse --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- which kinda surprised me, because, you know, I thought, "Well, gee, what ever set that off?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I was traveling with, um, a three year old and a one year old and my one year old had had an ear infection --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and ha- -- or -- or s- -- not -- maybe it wasn't an ear infection.  But she had something that I was putting into her -- some drops that I was putting into her ear --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I had a bulb syringe with me --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in my purse to squeeze out the extra stuff.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, they pulled it out!  They wanted to [LAUGH] know what it was.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I told them and I think the fact that I was carrying a baby in my hands -- they kinda relented and he still had a frowny look on his face and th- -- I said, "Why?".  I said, "Did that look like some kinda, like drug paraphernalia or something?"  I was joking, and he was like, "Uh-huh" [LAUGH] [NOISE].  So --
R:  Eh? [LAUGH]
L:  -- I have no idea [LAUGH] --  I have no idea what -- [SIGH] what that could have been or maybe he wanted to know what was inside it, or something but I thought, "Well how --" -- well, I guess maybe you could squeeze up, if you had drugs and some kind of powder maybe, you could squeeze up.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.  [SIGH] But anyway, it's kinda off the topic but I guess I remember being kind of impressed that they were being that thorough.  That they were --
R:  Yeah.  That -- that's -- 
L:  Look at --
R:  -- really good.
L:  You know, look at something that -- that was, to me --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that mundane, as if it might be suspicious.  I thought, "Well, they're, I guess they're looking for all kind of stuff", you know.  So, yeah, I felt -- I felt better about that too. [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH] Well, I remember, um, [NOISE] the last time I flew internationally was in nineteen ninety six.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I was married to someone from England at that time.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  And we went to England to visit his family, and when we came back [LAUGH] he had long hair and I guess just based on that, they decided to search his luggage and they just -- they didn't even give me a second look.  They just let me on through.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, er, I could have been carrying goodness knows what in my luggage and they wouldn't have ever known --
L:  But they -- oh 
R:  -- but they start --
L:  They didn't --
R:  -- they were going through his.
L:  -- they didn't xray?
R:  Um, I'm pretty sure they probably did, you know, behind the scenes but they didn't do anything in front of me.  This was at customs coming back in --
L:  Right.
R:  -- at -- it was at [NOISE] the Dallas airport, actually.
L:  [NOISE] [MN]
R:  Um, but I thought, well, that's interesting profiling -- that they, "Long hair, get over here!" [LAUGH] But 
L:  Yeah.  I would think -- ah, that's what I thought, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when it goes under that -- on that belt and there's like a curtain -- not a curtain but there's -- I don't know, it's when your luggage disappears [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]  You know.  [SIGH] It's when your stuff disappears, I thought, and it comes out again on the belt.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That's what I thought, I thought they were xraying it then.  I know now.
R:  I'm -- I'm pretty sure they do.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um.  [MN] They should! [NOISE]  They --
L:  An- --
R:  -- they really sh- -- I've always just kind of operating -- operated under the assumption that they do, so I make sure that I don't put anything like -- well, anything that could be ruined by an xray in my checked luggage.
L:  Oh, that's -- yes.
R:  [NOISE] So 
L:  Huh.  I --
R:  I -- and, I mean, if they didn't do it before, I bet they do now [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I know.  I'm trying to think -- I know there are some --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- people that have got --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- how do I say this?  A little offended by so- -- I -- I don't remember exactly what, but it seems to me that right after nine eleven there were some people that, um, I guess, raised some flags at some point and they, apparently weren't -- it turned out they weren't terrorists but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- people felt like they were taking, um, measures that were too strong.  And then I thought, "Well, you know, how would you feel, I guess, if you had --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- somebody who'd been in one of the [LAUGH] three towers, or ".
R:  Right!
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah.  With -- with the horrible things that can happen from them being too lax [NOISE] I would really -- I would rather have the embarrassment of being put through extra security because they thought I looked funny, or --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- than -- than to get on a plane where they hadn't checked everybody out thoroughly and have it be blow up or something. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, no doubt -- no doubt.
R:  So, you kn- -- you know. [MN]  I recently read in an article that a lot of young mums have -- have that feeling more than anybody else.  Um, I have -- I'm thirty and I have a two year old.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I'm kinda of the mentality that I'd be willing to give up a whole lot of my freedom to protect myself and my son.
L:  Exactly!
R:  And I never really felt that way until I was a mother.
L:  You know, yeah --
R:  But [NOISE] --
L:  -- it's funny that you should mention that.  I -- I know that, um, you know, I -- when I flew -- I'm actually -- I'm -- I'm thirty one, so I'm -- I'm, you know, close to you in age and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, I've got -- I actually have four kids.  Um, and w- --
R:  You have your hands full then! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  W- -- and -- and because -- so, because of -- of flying being so expensive now, with all the extra [LAUGH] tickets we'd have to buy --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it would have to be a major event to [LAUGH] to get us up in the air!
R:  Yeah, I imagine [LAUGH] so.
L:  But, it's amazing --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that image.  I mean, I just, um, -- I -- I wasn't -- I was a little afra- -- you know, you just -- the whole feeling of being, you know, in the -- the take off and the descent.  I would get a little nervous about flying -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, I wasn't afraid to fly with the kids before.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But I -- I still have a hard time forgetting the -- the -- some of the images of nine [LAUGH] eleven.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And thinking --
R:  I understand --
L:  Oh!
R:  [LAUGH] I -- I used to love flying.  I love the feeling, especially the feeling you get when you first take off --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and your stomach feels kinda light and it's -- it's -- I've always loved that feeling.  It --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I kinda got a rush out of it.  And, I don't think I'm gonna -- I'm just not excited about the idea of flying any more --
L:  Yeah!
R:  -- at all.
L:  Yeah.
R:  If I have to I will, and I'm not gonna be terrified, but it's -- I -- I've just got a totally different feeling about it.
L:  Oh, I know.  Well, and statistically speaking, I mean, how many flights have there been in the last, oh, w- almost two years that have gone off just fine?
R:  Millions. [LAUGH]
L:  You know.  So [LAUGH] --
R:  So 
L:  So, statistically --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- sp- speaking --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you're still probably safer in the air than you are on the -- on the streets in -- in a car.
R:  I have no doubt about that. 
L:  Right.
R:  I've had, in the last four years, I've had two car accidents.
L:  Oh [LAUGH].
R:  Um, [MN] just about -- about ten months before I got pregnant with my son I was in a really serious accident.
L:  Oh, my!
R:  And, then [SIGH], when my son was just over a year old I was in a minor one --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, it -- it -- within, like, just a couple of years of each other it -- the only two accidents I've had in my whole life.
L:  Oh, I know, it's so bizarre.
R:  And -- but I got to thinking about that and thinking, "Well, you know, I -- if my odds of being in a car accident are so much greater, I'm -- it's -- I'm really not that scared to fly [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  Because, I went -- I went twenty seven years without hav- -- ever having a car accident.
L:  Isn't that [LAUGH] just strange?  Yeah, yeah.  I know.  I work in a, um, -- I work in a hospital.
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] And we get a lot of the, um, the level two traumas which are the ones that don't have -- ba- -- essentially they don't have to go to, um, to intensive care.  [SIGH] Um, so the ones where they're not too bad, but they come up with these cervical collars on to protect their necks, and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, it's just like they're always hungry and thirsty and we always --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- have to tell them that normally they can't eat or drink anything 'cause we have to rule out --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, [MN] until they've ruled out the possibility that they might have to have surgery, --
R:  Right!
L:  -- and they usually don't do --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that till the teams make the rounds in the morning.  And it's a teaching --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- hospital 'cause of the medical school there.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, everything takes forever 'cause it always has to be run by somebody [LAUGH] else.
R:  Oh, gosh!
L:  [LAUGH]  You know.
R:  Oh.
L:  The medical student comes in and talks to them, then the residents come around.  They run things by the attending and -- [SIGH] yeah, and s- --
R:  I -- I know kinda how that feels.  I -- I'm in a s- small town --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- in Oklahoma.
L:  Okay.
R:  And, um, we're close enough to a large city where they were able to move me by ambulance.  Th- -- I -- I -- they didn't know if I had any problem -- any breaks in my neck or anything.
L:  Right.
R:  Th- the CAT scan machine wasn't working that weekend.
L:  Oh, lovely!
R:  So, I got to spend the whole weekend in a cervical collar on a backboard.  That was horrible!
L:  But, you -- you were on the backboard the whole weekend?
R:  Yes.  Yes.  [LAUGH] It was awful!
L:  Oh, no!
R:  Um, they took me to Wichita, got me cat scanned and found out that I -- there were no injuries to my back or ver- -- or, um, neck.  So, they let me off the backboard and out of the cervical collar and I thought, "Oh!"  And I had a broken arm all this time, er.  They couldn't operate because I had a really bad respiratory infection when the wreck happened.
L:  Right.
R:  I kinda have a suspicion that
