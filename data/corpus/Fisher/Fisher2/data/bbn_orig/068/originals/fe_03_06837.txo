L:  Hi.
R:  Hey, I'm Dan.
L:  Hi, Dan, this is Raquel.
R:  Hey, Raquel.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, so I didn't quite hear the -- the entire question, I had it on speaker phone 'cause I was waiting so long --
R:  Okay, the q- --
L:  Um --
R:  The question was, um, does heightened airport security, uh, mean less terrorism in the air?
L:  Oh, okay, okay.  I -- I would have to say yes, that, um, y- you know, it definitely acts as a deterrent, if -- if nothing else, and that has, uh, I mean, it's difficult to assess because, of course, if nothing happens, um, you can't determine what hasn't --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- happened, whereas you can pinpoint when things do happen.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but I would, uh, [MN] definitely feel, especially now, that it's something that we need to -- to maintain.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, I know they're withdrawing, um, you know, a -- a -- a lot of people because they over hired deliberately after the attacks, and the whole intent was to, uh, remove them [LIPSMACK] I guess by September of this year, and, uh, I've always [MN], you know, for me it's -- it's, um, something that was needed in the first place --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, so it's kind of sad that, uh, y- you know, I see it as -- as something that would've, uh, was definitely avoidable.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, it's kind of pathetic that just on, you know, cutting knives, that this could've happened, it's not like they were with [MN], you know, bombs or anything like that.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, so ...
R:  D- is it something that maybe you had thought about even before September two thousand and one?
L:  Oh absolutely.  I've always thought that our, uh, security was rather pathetic, um, and even -- even in [MN], uh, New York I'm always, you know, I take the trains and [MN] sort of breathe a sigh of relief every [LAUGH] time I come out, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- unscathed, 'cause it's just, um -- I think it's something that we definitely took for granted --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that, um, you know, nothing like this could happen, and of course no one ever thought in those terms, that, um, you know, worse case scenario the plane would get hijacked --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but not that i- it would deliberately crash into another plane.
R:  Let me ask ya, how -- w- what do you think the -- the reason is that maybe this was something that was in you mind even before that attack?  W- was it because you had been -- you had been reading about things?
L:  Oh no, simply -- simply from traveling, um, just watching --
R:  So you're a frequent traveler?
L:  I am.  And, uh, I'd have to admit, looking at the security staff, I mean, these people did not -- I -- I -- I don't know what the, um, the requirements are, but [MN] I mean, most of th- -- half of them are like, um, you know, former ex -- you know, ex cons to begin with.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, and it -- it definitely did not make me feel secure.  I didn't -- I never felt that they were paying attention, um, to -- to anything that was going on.  They barely would monitor the screen and, uh, and they just didn't seem like even if they found something they would --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- really be proactive enough to [MN] -- to even comment on it, you know.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, that's a -- that's a really interesting point.  I --
L:  I mean, what's your feeling on it?  Do you --
R:  No, I have --
L:  Do you feel more secure or less secure, or you don't think it has made a difference?
R:  Um, no I really agree with you on most of it.  I -- I -- I think that I feel -- I feel more secure, um, I -- I -- I fly fairly frequently and, um, the thing is, I -- I can't say that I ever felt less secure, and I -- I guess in the sense that after -- after the attacks, um, I do feel more -- I guess less secure in some ways but also the heightened security I think is a good solution to it.  I'm not sure if you catch my drift, but --
L:  Mhm.  Oh right, I heard you say that you never really sensed a --
R:  I never sensed it before.
L:  -- a concern, but it's not something that you're opposed to either.
R:  Right, um, no, I'm definitely in favor of the heightened security, I, um, [MN] frequently hear people, you know, talking about, uh, the hassle of, um, needing to be searched or singled out, um, for any number of reasons and, um, I always try and, when I'm in a conversation with them, you know, I urge them to -- to see the necessity of it and to not o- -- mostly just keep a good attitude about it so that everything can run as smoothly as possible.  I -- I'm all in favor of, you know, of searches.  I wish they would search everybody --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, before they were to get on a plane.  And, um, I guess the interesting thing is -- is that, you know, after something -- after something like that, you know, profiling is -- I don't -- I don't consider it's such a -- such an evil anymore.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, I -- I -- I guess I just think that it's a risk, or not a risk, but it's a measure that needs to be taken --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, even if it includes singling somebody out. [SIGH]
L:  Right.  No, I -- I would agree, I mean, I don't think -- I think profiling is actually commonsense.  I mean, if -- if [MN] there's a specific, um, [MN] target group that w- -- that we know is responsible, it's not like you're going to be, um, looking at, you know, little old [MN] [inaudible] -adies.  Um --
R:  Right, hm.
L:  -- so to me it -- i- -- I don't think it's -- I -- and I think that's the problem we've had in the past, is everyone's so worried about, um, you know, either being considered a racist or -- or whatever, to the point that if they see something, they don't wanna say anything.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, uh, you know, they're more fearful of being labeled a -- a, you know, a -- a racist than they are of something actually potentially happening.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I think [MN], um, lately what's happened, luckily, is that people are -- are more concerned about what could happen if they don't say anything --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, than they are if, you know, if they do, and it's, you know, it seems to be true.  Like I remember [MN], um, a few weeks a- -- no, not a few weeks perhaps, a while back, there was some -- some drunk people that were on the -- [MN] I think it was like the Williamsburg Bridge or maybe the Brooklyn Bridge, or something, and a -- a woman reported it, um, afraid that it was some sort of, um, you know, terrorist plot or -- or whatever, and it was --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- and it turned out just to be a bunch of drunk people [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- who happened to climb up.  Um --
R:  Really?
L:  -- but I think that's something in the past that no one would've, you know, they just would've seen it and have thought nothing.  Maybe their first thought would've been, "Okay, there's a bunch of drunk people" --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- whereas now it would -- totally gives them a different perspective and they're, um, a lot more proactive.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um, [MN] you know, my opinion, it's [MN], I -- I mean for instance, let -- I -- I'm Asian --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so let's say that it happened to [MN], you know, the [inaudible] terrorist groups of the Phillipines, I -- I would not feel at all, um upset, if they questioned -- interrogated me more --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it would -- to me it would make perfect sense, and because I have nothing to hide it wouldn't -- and I think they would kinda see that, you know, I mean, I think they can also get a sense, just 'cause you're part of that same race group they're not -- I -- I would think, you know, they, um, could also have a sense of who was a little more suspect than others.
R:  Oh sure.
L:  But I would understand why they would, by necessity, have to probably ask me more questions than -- than like I said, some, you know, little old Russian lady --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that -- that passes by and, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, I definitely am in favor of, um, [LIPSMACK] uh, keeping the -- the airport security, and -- and I don't know what the new -- I know they've replaced it with federal staff and I don't know if that's -- that means that these people are better trained or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- your know, what -- what that process is exactly.
R:  Um, I -- I think that the -- it does mean that.  It's people who have, you know, training and also backgrounds in some type of, you know, organized or -- or high level security, police force -- what do you think about the -- the whole idea that, you know, there's a lot more information circulating about measures that are being taken to heighten security, um --
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- what do you -- what do you think of --
L:  Yeah, I'm a little conflicted about that, 'cause at the same time it's making people aware of, um -- I mean, all these ideas that [MN] -- that terrorists use have -- have in some form been set off by the -- by the media --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or from movies.
R:  Right.
L:  So it's almost like we're training them and, you know, giving them ideas that they never would've thought of --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, like any time I hear about stories, uh, in the news about how unsafe our reservoirs are and how easy it would be to tamper with it.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, which is basically doing the research for them, um, to see how easy it is.  So I'm [MN] a little conflicted about, um, that information.  I mean, there's a part of me that thinks, okay, this is [MN], you know, good to know in terms of having a government that you feel is sharing the information with you, but by the same token I don't -- I don't know how good it is in terms of safety.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, if that's necessarily the best.  I mean, I think hopefully somewhere there's a happy medium, you know, even during the, um, w- [MN] uh, Iraq war they didn't -- they couldn't disclose, you know, reporters at least couldn't disclose full information of what was going on or where they were located, um, they could only sort of give you a rough idea, sort of thing, that wouldn't be --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- too compromising for them.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, but I think that's a -- it's a good point you -- you bring up though, because it's -- it sort of gives people, [MN] you know, um, an advantage, if you know what to look out for.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And if -- whereas if, um, you know, this wasn't happening it wouldn't even be an issue at all, I think we would perhaps be able to catch more people that way.
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  Um, but I -- but I do like this whole idea of [MN], you know, this, um, [LIPSMACK] -- with being able to identify people with your eyes, I guess, or some sort of like, laser -- you know, it was like in [MN] -- the kind of stuff you see in movies again, like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- Minority Report and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- whatever, where you can actually, uh, now identify people with like, scanning their eyes, and --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- um, I mean, if that's something that can be done, and then they have this other kind
