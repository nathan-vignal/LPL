L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, my name's Lorraine.  A- --
R:  And my name's Cherie.
L:  Where do you live?
R:  In Mi- -- Mitchell, Indiana.
L:  Oh.  I live in Louisville, Kentucky.
R:  Well, that's not far apart, right, is it?
L:  No!  That's not at all.  So, I guess our topic today is airs- -- port security.
R:  Well, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- what's your opinion?
L:  I think it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- helpful.  I think it's, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- i- -- i- -- probably, you can get by it.  But I think its helpful to deter, you know, make it harder and so, maybe terrorists would look for another way.  What do you think?
R:  [NOISE] Well.  Yeah.  I think you're probably right [NOISE], but there's some cunning people out there and they can scheme up all kinds of ways can't they? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  They're probably -- it probably makes it more of a challenge for [LAUGH] them.
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  But, er, you know, it might stop lower level criminals [LAUGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- from trying to do something, you know.
R:  Yeah [NOISE] it might catch some guns -- handguns and --
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  -- knives.  Of course, we know they've got through too, on occasion [NOISE].
L:  Yeah.  Well, it does make you feel better though --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if -- if you're a passenger, to -- to at least think there --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is some security [NOISE] available.
R:  [NOISE] And I --
L:  [inaudible] just --
R:  What I wonder is, how thoroughly are they screening the screeners? [NOISE]
L:  Right.  Well, [NOISE] I went on a trip last year --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, wh- -- we had to go back through security.  They had to empty the airport because one of the screeners fell asleep --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- while he was looking at the xray machine.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, it made you [LAUGH] wonder --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- how good a job they were really doing if he fell asleep.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And, it was kinda bad because they said there had been a security breach in the airport and it made everybody nervous --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- because, um, it was right around the time of the Olympics and so, [MN] people were w- --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- worried about terrorism and they were worried maybe somebody had a gun, or something and then we came to find out, it was just because, the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a man had fallen asleep that we had to do that.  And some people were on planes --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- with the door shut and they made him get off, and ... 
R:  That would be scary.
L:  Yeah.  So, I think they definitely need to work on --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, the security, you know, people [LAUGH].
R:  Yes.
L:  [LAUGH] So, what do you think?
R:  [NOISE].  Very much the same [SIGH].  I don't really think the government should have taken it over [NOISE].
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think the private sector could do [NOISE] just as good [NOISE], or better a job [NOISE].
L:  But I do like the fact that it makes it consistent --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- around the country, instead of just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- being, you know, each airport kinda doing their own thing.  So you know what the rules are.  Although, I was on a trip to Birmingham and I thought they were supposed --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to check --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- your driver's license to make sure you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- i- it matched with your ticket --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and they didn't check it.  I was kinda surprised --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- 'cause I thought everything was supposed to be the same.  But ... anyway [PAUSE].
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's kind of an easy topic.  It's [LAUGH] hard to talk about for ten minutes, I think [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah [NOISE].  I've never even been on an airplane, so I've not had to go through all that.
L:  Oh, okay. 
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  Well, it's kinda funny and sometimes they make you take your shoes off, and everything [MN]. 
R:  I guess just whatever mood strikes. 
L:  Yeah they have a -- they do it randomly so they can --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, m- -- in case -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- since they had that shoe bomber incident, to see if anybody has explosives in their shoes.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And, so, they randomly do that.
R:  But, if these terrorists, or whomever, knows that it's done randomly --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if enough [NOISE] of 'em goes to one airplane, [NOISE] the odds are that one of them will get through. [NOISE]
L:  That's true [PAUSE].  Yeah. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So ... [PAUSE]  But, it does make -- I think it makes the public feel a little --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- safer, to at least think --
R:  Oh, I'm sure it --
L:  -- they're trying to --
R:  -- does. [NOISE]
L:  -- do something.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Like the Department of Homeland Security, I don't know how much they can really do --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but, it sure does feel good --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- knowing somebody's at least trying.  So ...
R:  [NOISE] I'm scared of airplanes, period [LAUGH], so ... 
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] [PAUSE]  But, exactly, the need has never come up for -- the actual need for me to get [NOISE] on one, so ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess I would, if I had [NOISE] to.
L:  Right. 
R:  [NOISE] W- --
L:  Well, I -- I think its kinda fund.  It's nice to get to where you need --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to go, quickly.
R:  Mhm [NOISE]. [PAUSE]
L:  Um.  [MN] And, I guess, it -- the topic kinda goes along with the, er, the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- terrorists alert flags.  You know, in Indiana, do they -- do your fire departments have --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- different colored flags for the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- different terror alerts?  Like, our fire department --
R:  Huh-uh.
L:  -- has an orange flag that waves below the American flag so you know what --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- level you're at.  And, I guess that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it changes up to a yellow flag.
R:  [NOISE].  No.  Not here.  We're just a small town.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I don't know how much [NOISE] difference that would make, but, [NOISE] and it's a volunteer fire department [NOISE].
L:  Mm, mhm.
R:  [NOISE] But, still, it wouldn't take much to change a flag, I know.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].  You just need five different colored flags, and 
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  Of course, I don't think we'll ever go below yellow.
R:  Probably not. [NOISE]
L:  I think its kinda funny that they even have the green and the blue --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- 'cause I don't think we'll ever use the green and the blue.
R:  [NOISE] And then again, eventually they may just do away with the whole thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  After a p- -- period of time with nothing happening [PAUSE] [NOISE].
L:  Yeah.  Oh, well ... um, I think we've covered the topic.
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  Let's see.  How does it affect terrorists?  I would think that terrorists would do something different anyway than what they did on September eleventh. [PAUSE]  Just to come up with something new --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- be more shocking.
R:  [SIGH] [NOISE] Yeah.  They'd have to have access.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] I kinda wondered about the, er, [NOISE] Indianapolis five hundred, if maybe something might be tried at that, but ...
L:  [MN] Yeah.  A- --
R:  They say it was the best [NOISE] -- the most secure that it had ever been.  So, that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- may [NOISE] have been a deterrent [PAUSE].
L:  Yeah.  'Cause they had -- let's see, was it President Clinton and the former President Bush, both there?
R:  Mhm [NOISE].  They both were there.
L:  Yeah.  So it made me a little nervous too [LAUGH].
R:  And, thousands of people.  [NOISE].  I think they'll look for some place with a lot of people.  Don't you? 
L:  Oh.  I would think so.  Yes.
R:  [PAUSE] [NOISE] Or, maybe, just one of the national landmarks.  Who knows, what's in their minds?
L:  Yeah.  They don't think like we think.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So ... but I just 
R:  But, I do think they realize now [NOISE] that there'll be repercussions, don't you?  If they do something?
L:  [NOISE] Yes.  I think so.  Oh, I don't know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I would -- I think they will do something else though, but --
R:  Yeah.  I do too [NOISE].
L:  -- but it's just a matter of when [PAUSE], so ...
R:  It's too bad [NOISE] [SIGH] that people are nuts. [NOISE]
L:  Excuse me?
R:  It's too bad that people are nuts [NOISE].
L:  Yes, it is too [LAUGH] bad.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But we got plenty of Americans who are nuts too [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah. [NOISE].  There's people in general. [NOISE].
L:  Right.
R:  It's too bad [NOISE] [PAUSE] [NOISE]
L:  Yeah. -- yeah.  Because, th- -- they're talking about, they're gonna put, er, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- one of the Oklahoma city bombers on trial again.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. 
L:  So ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You've got all sorts of nutty people out there.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But there's lots of good people too.
R:  [NOISE] Right. [PAUSE]  It's a good thing [PAUSE].
L:  This is only my second time --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to do one of these phone conversations.
R:  [NOISE] It's my third one [NOISE].
L:  Oh!
R:  I guess that's all they'll do.  Right?
L:  I thought -- yeah, I think so.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yet, other times that I've called, um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- all right, they've called me.  I haven't been here.  I just had a message on the answer machine.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Or, one time they called --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it was about a topic I didn't know anything about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- and I thought, "Well, I don't think I can talk for ten minutes, [LAUGH] about that.
R:  This one's not a very good one, I don't think [NOISE].
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's too easy to summarize, really [PAUSE]
R:  [NOISE] I don't suppose y- -- are you a R.M.C. subscriber? [NOISE]
L:  Er, what kind of driver?
R:  [NOISE] Refunding Makes Cents.
L:  [MN]
R:  A lot of these people, that are partaking of this quiz [NOISE] --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- through this magazine [NOISE].  Found about it through the magazine [NOISE].
L:  No.  I find out through my sister who does a lot of mystery shopper type things. 
R:  Yeah.  I'd like to get into that.  I know we're deviating, but [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  She said they really just need your voice.  They're trying to do voice recognition, so- -- or something.  Experiment.  I don't know. 
R:  [NOISE] On -- on this?
L:  Yes.  That's what my sister said.
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  But, I don't know.
R:  [NOISE] Maybe we're being recorded for terrorism.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That would be bad, and [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that was the third question.  To see what you really think [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That would be very clever.
R:  Mhm [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  It's weird to think about the terrorists, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- who have lived right here in the United States so there's probably some people that are right here in the United States right now.
R:  Yeah.  And being educated, at --
L:  Right.
R:  -- our expense [PAUSE].
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I don't know how much longer we have.  We have finished the topic already.
R:  It ought to be about time up.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
