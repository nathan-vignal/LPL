R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  [LAUGH] Hi, my name is Heidi, how are you?
L:  I'm Sheila Brown.
R:  Oh, hi.
L:  [MN]
R:  Where are you, er -- where are you located?
L:  I'm in Tennessee, in Crossville.  How about you?
R:  Oh neat!  I'm just up the -- up the road from you.  In Louisville, Kentucky [LAUGH].
L:  Oh great.  Well, I -- I h- -- have never done one of these --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- have you?
R:  No [LAUGH].
L:  Okay, good! [LAUGH].  And I thought when they said airport --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- security, "Oh, no, I've never --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- even been in an airport", so  [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, is that right?
L:  [LAUGH].  So, you may know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a little more about that one than me.
R:  Well, I've, um, -- [NOISE] I've been in a few airports.  Um, I've done a little bit of traveling since September eleventh, but I guess I want us to discuss the whole security crackdown and whether or not it's, um, [NOISE] you know, it's gonna take a toll on terrorism at all, which [NOISE] --
L:  If you think it helps, yeah?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, when you go --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- have you had to wait very long? [NOISE]
R:  I have had to wait a fair bit and my husband tends to get pulled over.  They have, em, they have regular checks but they have an extended check as well.  [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] And he tends to get [NOISE] pulled over for the extended check.
L:  Mm.
R:  They don- -- they don't like the look of him, apparently.
L:  There's something on his --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- not anything he's carrying?  Just an appearance or something?
R:  No, I think it's just his appearance.  Em 
L:  [MN] And a guy?
R:  He's a -- he's a male and he, em, doesn't smile a whole lot --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, he might look a little stern. [SIGH] Um 
L:  Like, he's thinking about something?
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].  It's li- --
L:  Okay.
R:  So -- so he tends to get pulled over for an extended check a whole lot.
L:  Well, how long is an extended one.
R:  [NOISE] Um.  [MN] The, er, -- it -- it only -- it doesn't take very long.  Probably maybe ten minutes or so, but, what's disturbing is that they won't, [NOISE] er, -- when he's been pulled over they won't let me wait [NOISE] for him.
L:  Mm.
R:  [MN] Er.  They've made me, like, continue on an- -- and get on the plane and stuff.  So, I've gotta leave him there [LAUGH], so --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- if [NOISE] [LAUGH] -- if they decide -- and it's happened a couple of times where, em, for example, we've gone to Las Vegas and we had to go through St Louis, and we got -- he got [NOISE] pulled over for the extended check, going and coming and they wouldn't let me wait for him.  They made me go, get on the plane [LAUGH].
L:  And he didn't get to join before it left, or 
R:  Yeah, he did.  But, I'm on the plane, wondering, you know --
L:  Wondering if he will?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  I had not thought about that.  
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  That would be -- that's scary [LAUGH]!
R:  Yeah.  I d- -- I -- 
L:  Wh- [LAUGH] --
R:  I don't understand the whole thing.  You know, the -- the [LIPSMACK] September eleventh [NOISE] happened because of, [NOISE] em, well, there were a lot of reasons, I guess, but I guess --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the whole thing of being able to carry knives on planes [NOISE] is just kinda [NOISE] --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- outrageous to begin with [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  I'm not -- I'm not --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- sure where, em, having --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a lot of, like, the checks and extended checks --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I'm not sure how much time --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- taken up, where y- -- they would draw the line at, to say --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, between your, er, safety --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, er, a major inconvenience.  I'm not sure where that line would be.
R:  Yeah.  No 
L:  But, er 
R:  And I never see -- what happens is, I mean, you go through the regular, [LIPSMACK] um -- the regular check and then when you -- you know, you -- you put your -- your carry on throw and all that stuff and if they don't like the look of you, or whatever --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- they'll pull you aside, make you take off your shoes and all this kinda stuff.  [NOISE] I've never seem them take anything from people in this extended check.  So, I think it's just, [LIPSMACK] in my mind, it p- -- it -- it seems like they're just, um, [NOISE] --
L:  At random, maybe?
R:  Y- -- Yeah, they do it randomly but it just seems like smoking mirrors, you know, 'cause I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, that would be -- that would just scare me to death --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to have to take my shoes off, I'm very private -- very personal person --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  -- and, you know, and that would just, "Oh, no!".
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH] And I'm diabetic --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- too and I have an insulin pump so that would, er, -- I have wondered if I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- had to fly, are they gonna know what that is, or are they gonna look at me and say, "You need to take that off" --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know.  And which that's crucial to even live.  And -- and within a few hours --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I could be in major trouble.  So 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And carrying supplies.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I have wondered about the security issue there.
R:  I've read a little bit about that.  I think [NOISE] you have to have like something from your doctor or something.
L:  Yeah, I have --
R:  You know. [NOISE] 
L:  -- heard them recommend carrying that.  In fact, I guess a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- person should carry at all times --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- 'cause if we get some- -- we don't never know when we leave the house where we -- what's gonna happen.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, so --
R:  Yeah.  So you --
L:  -- a person --
R:  -- need to be prepared.
L:  Right.
R:  But, um, [LIPSMACK] yeah, I've read something about that, with the -- with the needles and stuff like that. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  That you just need to have paperwork on you that says, you know, this is why you need it and --
L:  I would --
R:  -- that sort of thing. [NOISE]
L:  -- be so nervous, they would say, "That's a suspicious person" for sure! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, how could you not be nervous if they're --
L:  Right [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] -- [inaudible] patting you down and asking you questions, and 
L:  And basically never ta- taking --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- my books back to the library [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  'Cause I -- I just know that little machine's gonna say I haven't returned them [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Now, how did you get hooked up with this, er, survey?
R:  You know, I can't remember [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, you don't know h- -- you don't know how they got your --
R:  I -- I can't --
L:  -- information?
R:  -- remember.  This is the first -- this is the first call I got and, um, there's been a couple of calls where, er, my voice mails picked up.
L:  Mine too!
R:  Um, [NOISE] but I just, er, when I got this call I said, "Oh, yes, that's that thing" and -- [SIGH] I remember signing up for it but I can't remember where. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, well I did mine through, ah, Refund --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and Make Cents[?].
R:  Mm.
L:  Do you ever go to that?
R:  No!
L:  No, okay.  I --
R:  Is it a website?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Its, um, like, maybe four dollars, um, er, for every three months, where you --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  -- get information for refunds and discounts --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and savings and that type of stuff.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And, er, so I know a lot of the other --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- people have been saying, like, "Get somebody that was a member of that".
R:  [NOISE] [MN] Mhm.
L:  But, um, I have missed two calls already --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and so I thought, "Oh, I'm finally catching it".  So, my voice mail --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- yeah.  So -- but 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Ah, how often have you flown, or 
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um.  I've -- let's see now, if I can remember.  Um, September eleventh I went on a trip that Christmas and th- -- I did a lot of traveling last year and then I went [NOISE] -- I won a trip to Vegas from Louisville last Christmas and then we went, um, [NOISE] gee whiz, if I can remember it.  Then we went on a cruise so I had to fly to Florida, er, in the Summer. [NOISE]
L:  Wow!
R:  And then in the fall my husband had to go on business to California so I went with him, and then we went back to Vegas, so [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, man!  I --
R:  -- we [LAUGH] --
L:  -- have hardly gotten out of this --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- State.  So, er, I'm thirty four years old and I have hardly been out of Tennessee.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  We're poor people! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] Oh.  That, er, now that would be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that would be amazing to me to even get to some of these places.  And [MN] my husband has often said --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- as far as flying -- the fear of flying an- -- and all that you'd go through.  He said if we ever had to go anywhere, we'll have to drive.  It will take --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- us forever!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, it's not, em, -- [LIPSMACK] I don't find fly -- and fly -- I've done quite a bit of flying but I don't find it too bad.  I just -- ah, I find all the, em, -- [LIPSMACK] em -- all that they've done since September eleventh has just been kinda foolish.  I mean th- --
L:  Well, yeah.
R:  -- they should have -- it -- and it's easy to say "Well, you should do this and you should do that" but I mean, had they done any of this stuff they're doing now --
L:  Before --
R:  -- they would have -- they would have caught these guys, you know.
L:  Well, it seems a little --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- overboard now.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  I guess.
R:  Yeah, it does to me.  And some of the stuff, you know, like the extended check, where you never see them take anything from anybody, it's just like -- so that's [NOISE] supposed to make us feel comfortable!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know [LAUGH].
L:  Well, at least they know I'm okay, right? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly, yeah.  I feel really secure now!  [SIGH] Yeah, you know.
L:  And I imagine you just come across --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- all types of people, er --
R:  Yeah.  And -- and some of the -- I was reading [NOISE] -- I was reading -- now this was read out for September eleventh too.  But I was reading where this one guy [LIPSMACK] got pulled over because he was reading a Harry Potter book. 
L:  Huh [LAUGH].
R:  And they didn't like what he was reading, so they --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- took it, er, -- they took it away from him, or w- -- they wouldn't let him get on the flight, or something.
L:  Sounds like they had not a lot --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of guidelines then for what they're thinking is suspicious.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Well, how about before September eleventh?
R:  Um.  I find -- I'm from Canada originally and, em, I find flying in Canada's a lot more comfortable and the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- airlines are a lot better and stuff.  [NOISE] Of course, there's only a couple and they're all government regulated.
L:  Oh!
R:  ah, but, the whole thing -- you know how you could carry a -- a blade up to four inches and all that jazz.  On flights down here --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- You couldn't do that in Canada.  [LIPSMACK] Um, so I think they were kinda -- [NOISE] they were too lax in security to begin with, you know. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  It just really sounds like we were --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just really taken over in nobody thinking it could, e- -- er, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- go down like that.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, it -- it's a terrible thing, don't get me wrong --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean, its just awful what [NOISE] happened, but, ah, I -- after it all came out about the knives and stuff I thought, [NOISE] "Oh, well I'm surprised this hasn't happened before".
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know.
L:  It's a horrible thought.
R:  So  [NOISE]
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.  It is, it's -- it's ah -- it's really just awful. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  I'm -- I'm with you, er, checking and -- and all that.  That would make you feel good as far as you weren't the one that kept getting targeted.  I mean, after how -- a- -- after several more times --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- say this happened to your husband, you know, eventually you would feel like, "Why am I always gonna --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- get stopped on this [inaudible]?  Can I have a letter that says I've been checked to many times?" --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.  Exactly.  Exactly.
L:  [MN] 'Cause I don't know.  That'd be a har- -- it would be a hard job to do and -- and from what I understand --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the people doing a lot of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- these checks are like -- they make some of the minor pay.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I heard that some --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- only made, like a security guard, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- six to seven dollars an hour and I thought, "Surely not".
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] 'Cause how could you care?  If that's true, how could you -- you know, I don't know if -- if you think, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "Well, I'm not getting paid enough to do this", you know?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  So 
R:  That, er, that's pretty [LAUGH] disturbing too.
L:  That'd be a pretty rough job and it could be a very dangerous one, couldn't it?
R:  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK] They had a, er, incident here at the airport, [NOISE] here in Louisville where, em, right after, you know, all these big regulations came in and they had these new federal people come into the airport -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and stuff, and they caught one of the guys falling asleep [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, no.
R:  [LAUGH] Asleep on the job, so  [LAUGH].
L:  Seems like I might have caught a little wind of something like that, but, ah --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, I guess that he didn't get to work much longer then [LAUGH].
R:  No [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Mhm.
R:  So, that's, er 
L:  [NOISE]  Well, this, er, great.  I was, ah, -- I was afraid I'd get a man or maybe somebody that was hard to ta-
