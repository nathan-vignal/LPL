L:  Hi, I'm Rebecca.
R:  Hi, My name's Becky.
L:  Did you say your name was Becky?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay.  That's cute.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Ah, let's see, the topic for today, do you think it'll -- do you actually think it'll lessen the ?
R:  I think it does, because, I mean, just knowing that -- that you're going to have to go through more, you know, security measures, I think people would be less likely to bring in things, you know.  And, um, mm, I think it makes people feel a lot safer too.  So 
L:  Yeah.  I'm not sure that it actually does do any good, knowing what I know about these type of people --
R:  Mhm.
L:  But if it makes people feel safer, then that's probably the best thing to do.  But as far as, like, um, bringing weapons, they've gotten smarter at how to do it.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  And, ah, the metal detectors and all that garbage doesn't pick up plastic --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so therefore, you know, all the plastic stuff that people have been bringing on, it just doesn't seem like it's going to be any different, because these people, when they're desperate, they're desperate.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I went through, ah, Desert Storm as a vet and --
R:  Oh really?
L:  Yeah.  These people, when they want something they will find a way.  And they will -- they're real good at planning and mapping things out --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so if they know that we've heightened the security level, they know that they can't take any metal aboard --
R:  That's true too --
L:  -- that doesn't mean anything about plastic.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So plastic explosives are on the rise --
R:  Well -- I guess -- I guess it's hard to, ah, be completely [inaudible] over that kind of thing, but what they've been doing, you know, they have sort of -- I guess the more rudimentary stuff they're able to catch now with the heightened measures --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but, but yeah, if there was something really thorough, I guess they wouldn't really be able to catch it.
L:  Not unless they're searching every single, solitary bag. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Rather than an x-ray, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- but I do think that it's -- it's at least making people feel more comfortable getting on, then they get irritated with the long time it takes to get through the airport --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I do think that it's really making things -- people more comfortable --
R:  Mhm --
L:  -- and that may be the only way --
R:  -- than actually solving something.
L:  I'm not sure it's going to solve anything.  It's just like, oh, I don't know, if somebody wants to drink and drive they're going to drink and drive no matter how many times you put 'em in jail.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And take their license.  You're still going to find 'em on the road.
R:  Mhm.  Well what do you think about how, like, right after nine eleven they wouldn't let people, like, of Eastern descent or whatever, onto planes and stuff?  What did you think about that?  Because that was sort of -- that was their way of protecting you, the planes, but I don't know if -- that's not really a way that you -- you'd completely be able to, you know -- I don't think that was the best measure.
L:  It wasn't.  It was very, ah, bigoted, as far as I was concerned.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because there's just as many Americans here --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah, born and raised, white, black, I don't care --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that can be swayed either way too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So how, by blocking off one section are you going to be able to prevent the other section?  'Cause it, you know, doesn't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- really make any sense, but it's just like in world war two, they contained all the Japanese Americans in, ah, containment camps.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, it's their idea that y- -- you sacrifice the many for the few, you know, the privileges of the many for the few that are invading it.  Um --
R:  Mhm.  Well, then maybe the solution really isn't at the airports, maybe they should, like, start before, because, um, weren't the -- the terrorists in nine eleven, weren't they doing um, suspicious activity before, that they should have been able to catch?
L:  Was it suspicious or was it not?  That becomes the question.
R:  I'm not sure, yeah.
L:  You know, but there is a national data base --
R:  'Cause it seems like -- 
L:  -- with these people listed on them, so why --
R:  Yeah, it seem like these things should be able to caught -- be caught before it even gets to --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- that point.
L:  That's why we have the, ah, actually it's an international, ah, list of people.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That are suspected of terrorism.  They shouldn't be allowed in the country.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they were allowed here, and if you trace it back far enough, most of your terrorists have been trained by us.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So why are we training people and letting them go back to their countries?  To me that doesn't make any darn sense at all.
R:  See, the idea of increasing airplane security, it's like, we're trained to solutions that are most quick solutions, they're not really getting to the entire problem, so, that's what I think about airplane security.
L:  I kind of agree.  A hundred percent, because it's just -- you got to look at the lapses everywhere else --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, and of course, you know, the FBI and the -- and the NIS and all that, they're -- and the CIA, they're not going to take credit for, you know, screwing up. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  So they're going to go, "Oh well, we need to increase airport security". 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, if you already had the flashes across the -- the, ah, wire that we were up for something, you know, we sat back and we looked at it and a lot of us, ah, ex military people talked about it for a very long time before anything ever happened --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah, with war, and we're like, okay, it doesn't take a genius to figure this out --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they always -- it was not the first time they've bombed the World Trade Center --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they have this nasty habit of high jacking airplanes --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so to me it seems to me like they should have added that security as soon as the flashes came across the wire.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Not after they've already high jacked five planes.
R:  Yeah.  Um, I don't know where you are, but, like, I've been on [inaudible] and to -- and um, the Oakland Airport, um, it didn't actually seem that much different.
L:  Really, I don't think it is.  I really don't, because I'm out here in Pennsylvania, down in Philly.  Of all places, you would assume that Philly would be, you know, really tight --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they're not.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, it's just, ah, people started getting feeling safe again and they laxed up on the security --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's very -- if you're going to do it, you're going to do it and you're going to do it all the time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  If you're not willing to put this into play until you have everybody, then why do it at all?
R:  Mhm.
L:  But it's the same principle as where they teach other people [inaudible] it's that you can go out and you're going to get killed -- m- -- more people get killed in car accidents than they do by a terrorist attack.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So what do you do?  You make sure that you are safe in your car --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but are you going to worry about it every day you get on the road?
R:  Mhm.  And --
L:  -- or are you going to --
R:  -- it's the same thing, you should take precautions to prevent that in the first place, not have to wait until something happens to actually, like, to start doing things, you know?
L:  Right.  Right.  And that was the fault I had with the -- with the government the way they planned it, because they did have fore warning.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they didn't adhere to it.  And it really does not make a whole lot of sense to me.
R:  Mhm.  Because, of course, there -- I don't they would -- they're not going to try, like, in air- -- in airplane hacking again so soon, because obviously that's what were going to be looking for.
L:  Don't be surprised.  Don't be surprised. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's easy -- they -- they know the airport systems real well.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And just because we put those protective things in place, I am not so sure that they won't try it again.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, because they are smart.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Just because they use primitive means of doing things does not mean that they can't expand.  They have the money to do it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  If they really, really want get something, they're gonna get it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's just like any average criminal here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So it's just kind of, I don't know, things are just kind of chaotic at this point as far as that's concerned, but if it makes people feel safer, which will bale -- bale out our airlines at this point, I would do it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but the last thing I think about when getting on a plane is there's going to be somebody there to attack it.
R:  Mhm.  So has it made you, um, any more anxious about flying?
L:  No.  Mhm. I'm -- I'm a lot different than your common person though, because I've already been in war.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So I've already learned that you make peace with the day each day.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So that way at the end of that day, if your day is over you have no regrets.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm more like the ones that crashed the plane here in PA.
R:  Oh.
L:  I'm not going to sit back --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I -- I can't.
R:  Did you know people in that crash?
L:  No.  They were from all over.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But it crashed in the town where my friends are.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And we all had the same feeling, ah, they were on the pay phone or on their cell phones calling their wives, saying, "Look, we're not going to die --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- "this way.  We're going to die fighting."
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I'm afraid to say it, but that's exactly how I am.
R:  Yeah, that's a good attitude to have.
L:  You know, if you know you're going to die anyway 'cause they're going to fly that plane into something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- why in the world would you go down without fighting?
R:  Mhm
