L:  [NOISE] 
R:  A- -- Andrea.
L:  Hi, this is Christine.
R:  Hi. [LAUGH] 
L:  Hi.
R:  [SIGH] So --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- this is about, um, athletes striking.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  Are you into s- 
L:  I c- --
R:  Are you into sports or ...?
L:  I watch -- the only thing I ever watch is football.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I can't say I have a really strong opinion on it.  Uh, [SIGH] um [LIPSMACK].  Do they deserve the high salaries?
R:  No.  [LAUGH] I don't -- I mean [SIGH] don't get me wrong.  I watch sports.  I'm a big hockey fan.  Like, I love hockey and I love football [SIGH] but the thing is -- is that -- it's like -- my husband, he works in the medical profession --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and it's like he helps -- like, he's not like a doctor or anything, but he like helps people who [NOISE] like have a rough life.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  And it's like -- and he gets paid like, nothing.  Meanwhile he's dealing with people's lives and like, here are -- and here's like, sports, which is an entertainment, and they get paid millions of dollars.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's what bothers me about it. [SIGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, ah I think [SIGH] -- well [LIPSMACK] I mean peop- -- what about people uh, in the entertainment industry?  Actors, actresses, directors, whatever.  I mean, they get paid a lot of money as well and they're not, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they're entertainers and ?
R:  [NOISE] Oh I know, and I don't agree that they should --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- be getting paid the salaries that they do either --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- but, um -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- but, um -- but like I said, the people in the sports, you know, I just [SIGH] -- like I say, I love sports and I buy, you know, the jerseys and everything, but it's just, I just don't agree with their salaries.  And I mean, it's so funny [SIGH] because it's like [SIGH] they'll go out and they'll have um [MN] -- it's our conversation thing -- and they'll go out and they'll um, you know -- 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- like you'll have these like college kids get into football.  You know, like they'll get drafted into the NFL and it's like they'll get paid, like, a million dollars.  But then they have these agents that are like, "Oh no.  You got to hold out for more".  I mean, God, the kid's like set for life.  You know?  And it's just like that they just want more and more and more, and it's like what possibly could you need all that money for?  You know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like me -- I mean, I would need in order to pay like my bills off -- like I'm talking about my mortgage, you know.  Just like my high mortgage and everything.  [SIGH] It's like I would need a hundred grand and I would be, uh, completely out of debt. [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  But it's like that these sports people -- it's just -- I just [MN] -- I just totally disagree with their salaries.  I just don't think it's right. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] [MN] 
R:  Because back -- you know, back in the day, you know a baseball player -- like I was listening to the one radio station in our area and like, the one baseball player was like, "I can't even believe how much these people are making".  He's like, "I made eighteen thousand dollars a year", and he was in the major leagues and this is, like, back in, like, I guess, the late sixties, early seventies.  And he's like, "I was in the major leagues and everything and I made eighteen grand a year" and he's like, "Now, these kids are coming out of college and making millions of dollars".
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, um, I totally don't agree at all with it and I just don- -- I mean, it's like it's to the point now where it's not even -- it's not even for the love of the sport.  It's like, they go, do what they gotta do and they get -- they collect the pay check and that's it.  Whereas it just seems like [NOISE] you know, it's [NOISE] kinda like [NOISE] when you or I go to work or whatever, you know?  I don't enjoy going to work but I go and I collect my pay check [NOISE] and you know, but it's like they should -- they should enjoy what they're doing but it just [NOISE] seems like they're doing the same thing.  You know?
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I'm sorry [LAUGH] am I dominating --
L:  No, that's fine, no.
R:  -- the conversation? [SIGH] [LAUGH] 
L:  Um.  Yeah.  I guess I -- I -- just have a -- um ... [LIPSMACK] Oh, I just don't have a strong opinion about it.  I mean, I think there's a lot of people in the world that make a lot more money than they actually need and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, it's not just entertainers.  It's not just sports.  I mean, it can be people who invest in the stock market, you know.  And they make a lot of money and I guess my feeling is, if you can make the money --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, by all means do so, but I personally -- if I'm ever in that position to, you know, make more money that I actually need, then I'd want to use some of that money to give back to the community. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And [LIPSMACK] I think there are, you know, I'm cert- [MN] -- probably not all people but, I'm certain that a lot of sports professionals -- for instance, I -- I happen to live in -- outside Boston, and so I followed the New +England Patriots and -- um Drew Bledsoe when he was here, I mean, he made millions of dollars every year and he's -- has a charitable organization.  H- -- he gives a lot of his money away and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that goes to -- you know, it gets put to good use and -- is it enough money?  I mean, you know, I -- I don't know, but [SIGH] um [MN] I feel like, you know, if they're able to earn that then, you know, it's kind of like the American way of life --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, go out, make your money, do as you see fit, live the American dream.  Kinda how we're brought up and if these people are able to find a way to do that, you know, I don't really have a problem with that.  I would just hope that, you know, they respect the fact that, you know, there are starving people in the world and there are a lot of needy, um, [LIPSMACK] charitable organizations in the world and hopefully that they'll try to give something back.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um.  You know, I think even, for instance, people in the medical -fession, while they might not be making as high salaries as people in the sports or entertainment industries [SIGH] um, they still can make -- have the potential to earn a lot of money and they are doing good work, um, and I certainly don't think that they don't deserve it but a lot of people could argue that they're making money off of people's sickness and people's injuries and whatever.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um.  So that I -- I mean I just -- I guess personally I don't feel like it's -- it's a good thing to go there, you know?  Like, make your money, be honest about it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and give something back.  I guess that's kind of the way I look at it.
R:  Mhm.
L: [NOISE] Um 
R:  And that's -- and I -- and I mean -- and I  -- and I agree with you on that.  I mean, as lo- -- I'm like, as long as you know, they are giving it to like charitable organizations and you know -- and -- and giving back to the community, fine, that's great.  You know?  But like I said, it's just -- [MN] [SIGH] I don't know, it's just [MN] --
L:  There's -- there's [MN] there's no doubt --
R:  -- I -- I have to look at their fa- --
L:  -- that there's a lot of greed in the world.
R:  Yeah.
L:  There's no doubt about that.
R:  And then if somebody like -- [MN] and I will be the first to admit, if somebody said, you know, "Andrea, if you could play hockey, we'll give you, you know, a million dollars" I'll be the first to admit okay, I won't turn it down. [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.  [SIGH] And I mean, yeah, I sound like a total hypocrite but I'm just saying I [MN] -- my whole thing is, is that -- [MN] see 'cause I used to play pick up hockey and I enjoyed playing hockey, you know, and um -- but the thing is, is I'm like -- okay, what about[?] my family.  You know?  I think that -- that at least, you know, I could take care of my family and, you know, then we'd be set for life and I'd think of my kids and everything.  [SIGH] But, just like I said, I guess it bothers me, it just seems like now, like they go in, they -- they do their thing -- you know, they play for a couple of minutes and it's just like -- you know they do that and then, you know, they're collecting this huge amount of money.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  I don't know.  Maybe I just sound bum or something but --
L:  No.
R:  -- I also look at -- I also look at my husband and it's just like [SIGH] what he makes is like so -- I mean, he deals with drug addicts.
L:  Yeah.
R:  He deal- -- he deals with alcoholics, you know --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and it's like he tries to help people get their lives back together and he makes like ten seventy for an hour.
L:  Mm, I know.
R:  You know?
L:  I -- I mean -- I'm actually --
R:  You see -- do you see my point?  It's like --
L:  Oh totally.
R:  Uh-huh [SIGH] 
L:  I mean, I'm actually going back to school to be a social worker --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, you know, I'm going to go thousands of dollars into debt in order to do that and I'm going to come out and, if I'm lucky, I'll make, you know, somewhere between thirty and thirty five thousand dollars a year.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I recognize that, you know, there's a trade off to do the work that I want to do.  I'm not going to be able to you know, make a lot of money.  Um.  It's just -- it's just a question of what really motivates you in life.  I'm just not particularly money motivated myself but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I understand that a lot of people are and they would rather do a job that maybe isn't where the heart is in order to make better -- a better living --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um. [LIPSMACK]  For me, that is like a living hell.  I would -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I would hate to do a job even if it pays well, um, [LIPSMACK] that I just -- my heart wasn't in it, you know?  
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'd rather take the less money and -- and live a happier life but everyone -- but it -- what makes people tick is different.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And --
R:  Well, I'm the -- I'm the same way 'cause I just got out of a job where it's like, oh my God [SIGH] I came home every day and I used to say to my husband, "I hate my job.  I hate it, I hate it, I hate it" and I got another job and, I mean, it's like a thousand dollars less than what I was making [SIGH] but it's like, you know what, I am so happy now. 
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  I'm so much happier.  [SIGH] I don't come home every day saying, "I hate my job".  I'm not miserable.  I think I'm easier to live with now [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- than I used to be.  Because it was just like -- an- -- and I mean, [MN] I'm money motivated to an extent but I'm the same way.  I'm just, like, I look for happiness. 
L:  Right.
R:  You know? [MN] But, um.  [SIGH] But it's like you always hear -- you know, it's so funny 'cause I always hear, you know, people whom [MN] -- who will go on about how much the athletes get paid and they get all upset and everything [SIGH] and I'm sitting there and I'm like, "Okay, well you're the one who sits next to me at the football game.  And you're the one" -- you know?  Like I said, I totally buy the stuff and everything so it's like I'm not, you know.  I totally go to the games and I buy and you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and all that stuff is -- but then there are these people like I said that are like, they see an athlete, "They get paid so much money"--
