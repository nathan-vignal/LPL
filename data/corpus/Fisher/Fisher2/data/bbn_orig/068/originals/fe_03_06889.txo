R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  My name is Jackie.
R:  Hi Jackie, I'm Emily.
L:  Hi Emily.  How are you?
R:  Good.  How are you doing?
L:  Okay. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I'm in Utah and we're having a very warm Saturday.
L:  Utah, oh.  I'm in --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm in Illinois.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And we're having a cloudy, rainy, cool day. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.
L:  So, ah, how often do you do this -- you just start doing this?
R:  Um, yeah, I did.
L:  Yeah, this is only my second time.
R:  [LAUGH] I know, it's kind of weird, but --
L:  I know.
R:  -- I don't -- I don't really um, keep up much on the Middle East.  I -- you know -- [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I -- I -- I don't --
R:  [LAUGH] [several inaudible words]
L:  I don't either.  Um, I really, you know, doubt if there will ever be peace, but [COUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I guess -- I guess you should keep trying.
R:  Yeah, and I think it's -- it sort of -- that we need someone to go and mediate.  Um, I feel bad when it becomes, like, if they're going to have to be there for a really long time, I think it's a good idea to get out as quick as you can --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and still have them running their own countries.  I don't know, we're not meant to run it. [LAUGH] 
L:  No.  Right.  I think we're, you know, we should go in and we should do something about it and we should do --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- something about terrorism, and let them know we're not just going to sit back and let them attack us, but you're right, I don't think we should stay there a real long time.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  But I mean, they have -- they do have to still restore order and stuff, I guess.
R:  Yeah, and I guess it takes a while, but I just --
L:  Yeah, to get a new government together, I guess that's not a --
R:  [LAUGH] [inaudible] [LAUGH] [several inaudible words]
L:  [LAUGH] But I'm not -- I guess -- you know, I'm not any kind of authority on it or anything.
R:  I know.  I just kind of, you know, I let my husband watch the news and he tells me the interesting side. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, right. [LAUGH] That's about what I get, too.
R:  Oh.
L:  I mean, I'm glad the, you know, the fighting -- the basic fighting's over and --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- I'm sure -- you know, I'm sure other families are all just as glad too, because that's sad, you know, to see these people die.
R:  Yeah, see that's -- I don't know, if your family's over there I'm sure you'd be much more involved in it, where I don't know anyone -- 
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  -- I can still be removed and I think if I even just knew someone, like, a family over there, I'd probably get a lot more involved.
L:  Exactly.  I would too.  But I'm just grateful I don't have anybody over there.  But ah --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- you know, I really appreciate those that do go and I have, ah, two teenage boys.  One's going to be eighteen in November, so it's kind of scary, you know --
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  -- that way, because I sure don't, you know, want to send my kids off, but --
R:  Yeah, certainly.
L:  -- you know, so hopefully, ah, there won't be any drafts or any [LAUGH] thing like that.
R:  Yeah, because my youngest brother is turning eighteen in a couple of weeks, so that's the same thing I was thinking.  I mean, a- -- everyone in my family, even like, my husband, you know, is old enough to, you know, in that age --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- [several inaudible words] they could just go and you never know.
L:  Oh, I know.  You know --
R:  If they need to go or not.
L:  -- if these things go -- last a long time and then they start, you know, drafting people and stuff it's very scary, so 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [several inaudible words] and ah, I'm sure there'll be another country though, with this terrorism, fight on terrorism.  You never know where we're going to go next, so 
R:  I know, and it seems, I don't know, it just seem like there's always going to be a problem somewhere in the world, and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [several inaudible words] ever be peace. [LAUGH] 
L:  I do, yes. [LAUGH] It would be so nice if we could just all get along, wouldn't it? [LAUGH] I don't understand, you know, when everybody wants to be in control of everything and everybody wants all the power and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then we got a lot of people that don't like, you know, us, so --
R:  Exactly.  
L:  But I mean --
R:  Some people, we go in and you think, oh they're going to be happy and they might not be happy. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  They're happy a little bit that the, you know, the ruler's gone but then they don't want us around either.  So it's just like 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  Someone's going to want to come and get us again. [LAUGH] 
R:  I know.  And that's what I worry about, even more than a war somewhere else, I worry about um, another attack, like --
L:  Oh, after nine eleven, that so scary --
R:  -- on the US soil.
L:  Yeah, I mean that was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that was just incredible.  I -- I c- -- I -- it was just -- I still can't believe that happened.
R:  Yeah, and you just think back and, you know, if September will be [inaudible] because I don't know --
L:  It know.
R:  -- it's -- it's pretty crazy that something that big can happen and we wouldn't catch it or --
L:  I know.  It's just --
R:  -- [inaudible] practically right under your nose.
L:  I mean, I know, it was just -- I mean, everybody was just blown away [LAUGH] anyway --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I was just very surprised that it could happen here, that we wouldn't know about it somehow and be able to prevent it somehow, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But aeroplanes flying into buildings, it's just incredible.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know, people are crazy and so 
R:  True.
L:  I mean, you gotta be really, ah, I mean, just to do that to innocent people, that's just -- that's so mean.
R:  You really have to have been removed from yourself --
L:  I guess so.
R:  -- you know, just to -- your conscience --
L:  Yeah.  I mean -- I mean, to not care and to -- and then to -- and to be excited -- and these pe- -- these people that actually gave up their lives to do this, I mean, what were they thinking? [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  They were actually thinking this was a great thing and that they were going to be rewarded for this in the hereafter or somewhere. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  You go, no, that's not how it works. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I don't think so.
R: You are being scolded still. [LAUGH] That's what I like to think.  But anyway [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  But -- this is kind of a strange job but -- it's kind of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, it's worth it.  It's easy for, you know, ten --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- ten bucks. [LAUGH] 
R:  That's how I feel, like -- like I was trying to get some friends to join, and they're like, "Are you sure?  I'm going to wait until you get paid before I sign up". I'm like, well, so you do it, what are you out?  Like, ten minutes on the phone if they really don't ever end up paying you?
L:  You know, my sister, I believe she's got paid all ready.  She's the one that told me about it --
R:  Really?
L:  -- yeah, and I do bel- -- some- -- I think it's like, after five calls or something.
R:  Cool.  Well see, I'm going to tell them that I'll say look, someone's offered ten but I know [LAUGH] it's already on tape you're going to have to move[?]
L:  Yeah, right.  Um, I talked to one other person, so you're only my second --
R:  Oh okay.
L:   -- second so far.  How many did you talk to?
R:  This is my third call.
L:  Oh, so you're getting closer to pay day.
R:  I hope so. [LAUGH] 
L:  But ah, the one lady I call- -- ah, talked to, she said, I think it was on health and fitness, and she's like, "Well, we don't have to talk about that at all, actually that's not what they're looking for", and I'm like, well I thought --
R:  I know, I'm going huh?
L:  -- [several inaudible words] talking about the subject so she's just talking about her family and stuff, I'm like, oh, okay. [LAUGH] I don't know.
R:  How funny.
L:  I don't know what they want. [LAUGH] I mean, 'cause --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a lot of these subjects some -- some I'm going to know a lot about and others, I'm not going to know very much about, and my sister said, "No, you don't have to know a lot about it".  I'm like, okay.
R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] I'm talking to somebody in Utah, what do you know? [LAUGH] 
R:  I know, and I -- I'm trying to think of, I think it was, like, Colorado is where the other lady was, and I can't think of where the other one was but it was like, I'm always somewhere, like, I was in the middle of the mall --
L:  Oh really?
R:  -- and I was in there shopping for my suit and I just called up on the phone and he -- he was like, that's all you had to do?  When I hung up, I'm like, yes and that's what convinced him to sign up. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  That's easy enough.
R:  I was like, that's really all I have to do.
L:  Right.  Um, the lady I talked to the other day[?] was Wisconsin so she wasn't --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- too far from me, but Utah's quite a jump, and I don't know anyone in Utah, now I do, what do you know? [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I know.  I really -- I don't know, it's kind of, I don't know, I like talking to people because I have a phone job right now, so I end up --
L:  Oh, do you really?
R:  -- [several inaudible words] when people then, you know -- 
L:  So you're always on the phone, then?
R:  Yeah, it's not too busy but it's -- you get to talk to different people --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I, um, we're [inaudible] Oil, so I do the credit cards for the corporate office, and you also get a lot of truckers and they're interesting people to talk to because they've been a lot of places --
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  -- they don't talk to you very much, they don't get to talk to people very often [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I work for -- I work for FedEx Grant[?] at night
R:  Oh.
L:  Ah I work at night and my husband works during the day so I'm home with the kids but I --
R:  That's a good way to do it.
L:  -- yeah, and this is a good thing to do in between times, so 
R:  Exactly 
L:  -- they ca- -- they do it on the weekend so --
R:  Yeah, I'm, like, on my way to a wedding and I'm completely lost, but [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, this isn't --
R:  But you know, I'm like, it'll take me ten minutes to get there and then it's really nice because you can kinda --
L:  So this is -- this will make you more confused though, not paying attention to where you're going. [LAUGH] 
R:  No, I'm basically at the end of the road so I'm just going to have to turn round and go back and see where I missed the turn. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I'm at home curling my hair right now. [LAUGH] 
R:  Getting ready for the evening.
L:  Yeah, it's my -- my husband's birthday, so ...
R:  Oh, it's your husband's birthday?
L:  Yeah, so we're going out to eat, so I'm getting ready.
R:  Oh, that's fun.
