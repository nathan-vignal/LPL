L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello. [NOISE]
R:  Hello.  I'm Rebecca.
L:  Em, I'm Elsie from New York.
R:  [NOISE] How's it going?
L:  Er, well, let's see now 
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  Do you think professional --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- athletes what?
R: [NOISE]
L:  Um, should they be getting their high salaries, is that what it is?
R:  Something about striking and salaries [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Well.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Um, considering --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- most professional athletes --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- have been, what should I say --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in training --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- ever since they were children.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, and they have been keeping themselves s- -- um, in good shape physically, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm 
R:  I think it's an outrage [LAUGH].
L:  I don't know.  You do?  Why, why, why?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Why?
R:  [LAUGH] Er, I just -- um, I --
L:  Because I'm trying to find something good to say about it, [NOISE] and I can't find --
R:  Well, I think it's -- it's great that they're -- that they are showing what you can do when you strike.  I mean that's cool --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like, to illustrate for workers [SIGH].
L:  Right, but ?
R:  But, it's, um, [SIGH] I just think that professional sport is [MN] holding it [MN] -- it seems like it's too much money.  I mean, a lot of people do things from when they're very young and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And they -- um, they certainly need money to retire on because they're not going to be able to play sport for ever --
L:  [NOISE]  Well, I wasn't think- --
R:  -- [SIGH] or to figure out another career --
L:  Well, they're --
R:  -- when that peters out, but it doesn't seem like --
L:  Well their -- wait a minute.  But their, um --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- their professional life ends early.  Some of them end at, um, aged twenty five --
R:  Well, all right but --
L:  -- most end at aged thirty -- thirty one or two.
R:  But --
L:  That's what I was thinking --
R:  -- if you make thirty thousand dollars a year how much does it take -- I mean how long --
L:  How much do they make?
R:  [SIGH] ah, no, I'm saying if I earn thirty thousand dollars a year how many years do I have to work to earn a million?  You know. [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's, ah, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- one million for one year.  Okay then that's all you get [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, I don't know.
R:  [MN]
L:  I don't know, um, I think we have -- because ninety nine per cent of --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- what I know about it is either through, um -- is through the media --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- through the, er, newspapers, through the radio, TV.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, and I think that's a one sided look we are getting because, don't forget, er, these are reporters who are telling us what, um, these people make --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and what they don't make and, you know what I'm saying?  [LIPSMACK] Because I was thinking, um, recently, here in New York, um, the doctors went on strike.
R:  Mm.
L:  And, um, I believe it was a month ago the doctors in New Jersey went on strike and their thing was that, um, the insurance was killing them because once they were sued by a patient --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, they were dropped by the insurance companies.
R:  Oh the -- yeah, malpractice --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- insurance.
L:  Yes.  And because of that, um, if they went to another company, um, the rates really --
R:  The rates were even --
L: -- shot up --
R:  -- higher, yeah.
L:  -- and they couldn't -- they couldn't afford it.  Well, the, um, athletes don't have that kind of problem.  [SIGH] I don't think I have -- don't remember ever hearing or reading about it but they do have, and I hate to bash th- -- the media and the reporters, [SIGH] but they do have the reporters --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- who tell us what they're doing or not doing.  And I think we are just seeing athletes through their eyes.  I don't know of any athletes to tell you the truth --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH] so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [SIGH] I can't really -- [SIGH] I can't really say, you know, but it just seems all my information comes through reporters.
R:  Well, what's funny is that the m- media makes a ton of money on professional sports.
L:  They make a lot --
R:  [MN] So, it's --
L:  -- of money, yes,
R:  -- a ton, I mean, with all the advertising and everything so it does seem --
L:  Why the -- when --
R:  You know, I'm not sure --
L:  -- they bash --
R:  -- how that would -- how -- how that would bias them.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, when they bash them, they do bash them.  This I have noticed, um, they've gotten athletes, er, suspended because the athlete didn't want to talk to them when they came out --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- of their, um -- you know, after a game.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And the athlete had to come back and apologize!
R:  [NOISE]
L:  They were made to apologize by the club's owner, you know, and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- anytime I see something like that I have to think something is skewed.  [MN] I'm not seeing what they claim I'm seeing.  You know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so, um, [MN] when the athletes --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- are suing for [LAUGH] high s- -- higher salary, or I should say s- striking but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's the same thing.  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when they're striking for higher salaries, um, there's gotta be something in there.  I started to say, um, it's gotta be part of the aggravation but I don't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- know if it's aggravation.  I really don't!
R:  Oh, I'm sorry, could you hold on just a second?
L:  Sure, sure.
R:  [NOISE] [PAUSE]
L:  Okay, here's what I'm going to do [NOISE] [PAUSE]
R:  Are you there?
L:  Yeah, I'm here!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Sorry about that!
L:  That's okay.  That's okay.  Er, yeah.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  So, er --
R:  Well --
L:  You know, as I said -- [MN] this might have been better from my brother.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  H- he'd have a whole lot to say but, em 
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] Yeah, I'm not a big -- I don't really watch a lot of sport.
L:  [SIGH] Neither do I.  Well, Let's see, um, tennis; I know something about tennis but that's the --
R:  What do you know about tennis?
L:  Mm? 
R:  What do you know about tennis?
L:  What do I know about tennis?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, let's see.  There's the women tennis stars [LAUGH] that I know about but usually, um, that translates into the Olympics, er, they --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- have the tennis championships, it's not a continuous thing.  So I figure they're athletes also.
R:  Wh- --
L:  But I've never heard them go on strike!
R:  Yeah, it's usually baseball, isn't it, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that goes on strike?
L:  And not even football players go on strike.
R:  Mm, mm.
L:  I'm thinking that, er, maybe it is a lot of, um, aggravation.  I don't think that there really -- okay, they make a lot of money, more money than me right now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'm leaving the ghetto from there [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] -- but -- but, um, just because you make a lot of money doesn't mean I have to think that, um, something -- oh boy, that there's something wrong with you because you're making a lot of money.  You know, [SIGH] because what --
R:  Right.
L:  -- comes to mind what I was thinking that is, um, you've heard the phrase, filthy rich?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I can't really -- now if I was extremely rich --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I think I would understand better what they mean by, filthy rich.  [SIGH] I rather suspect there's a lot of, er, what should I say, jealousy there, a lot of green eyes there [LAUGH] you know?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That's what I'm thinking, so, ah 
R:  In the public, or with the --
L:  Ah, with --
R:  --  the players?
L:  Well, no.  With, er, the people that would say things like that.  Um, I really think the whole thing is one sided.  It's, um, I really don't, er   Look, I wish them --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the best of luck, because if they're suin- -- if they're striking --
R:  I got it.
L:  -- for higher salaries, it just seems to me --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- er, they do know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the money's there, they realize --
R:  Jason!
L:  -- they re- -- hello?  Okay, they realize that they're brining in an awful lot of money for the club's owners, okay?
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  And, if you left it to the club's owners, er, they would pay them probably thirty thousand or less a year.
R:  [NOISE] Blue. [NOISE]
L:  You see?  So I'm thinking, um, that as far as, er, the athletes are --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- concerned, they're in a industry --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- brings in a lot of money.  It's a national past time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] And, I can't see why they shouldn't, um -- yeah, why they shouldn't enjoy some of the money that's coming in.  And when I say some of the money, millions and millions, I suspect it's billions and billions of dollars.
R:  I just think it would be cool if the -- the clubs could operate and pay the players well and not have to rely on so much, um, corporate advertising and, um --
L:  Well, I th- --
R:  -- sponsorship, if -- [MN] maybe, [MN] you know, if the players didn't -- and I d- -- I totally don't think it's the players.  Like, I think --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- the players deserve every penny they get.  They just, it's -- they --
L:  I think it should be --
R:  It shouldn't be so
