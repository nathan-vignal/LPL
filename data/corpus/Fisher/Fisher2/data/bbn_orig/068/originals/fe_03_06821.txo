L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Hello. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] Hello.
R:  I'm Janice.  [NOISE] I'm from Louisiana.
L:  [NOISE] I'm Barbara and I'm in Iowa.
R:  Oh okay.
L:  [NOISE] [COUGH] Do you have a cold also?
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, me too. [LAUGH]
R:  I mean it's bad.  It's been all day but it's just [SIGH] my head hurts real bad and my eyes hurt -n miserable.
L:  [NOISE] I know it.  The phone rang and my husband said, "It's that Fisher place" and I went, "Oh".  Well, anyway [LIPSMACK] --
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] -- so what are we supposed to talk about?
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] Strikes with baseball or 
R:  See, I didn't know -- I didn't really [NOISE] hear.
L:  [NOISE] Strikes with [SIGH] um, athletes I think.  [MN]
R:  Strikes?
L:  [NOISE] Recent athlete [MN] -- recent strikes concerning athletes like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] -- baseball strikes or basketball.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I don't know that there've been any recent that I can remember.
R:  Oh.  I haven't heard of anything.
L:  [NOISE] Um.
R:  But they're striking actually?
L:  [NOISE] Well, I think it's just your opinion of when they strike and do we think that they should paid the -- 
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  [NOISE] -- enormous salaries.
R:  Oh God.  Of course not. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] No. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] Um, no, I --
R:  [MN] 
L:  [NOISE] -- I think they're over paid and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] -- um and I don't think that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] -- [SIGH] probably striking [SIGH] does a whole lot for the good of the sport when, after all, it is just a sport --
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] -- and entertainment value, and um, I don't -- you know, I dunno.  I -- and I think every time there is a strike that it just ups the prices for the consumers who want to try to buy a ticket --
R:  Definitely that's true.
L:  [NOISE] -- and then I think it keeps people away --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] -- from the venues i- if they can't afford -- I mean most places now are out of sight for families to be --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] -- able to go --
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] -- to a game.
R:  [NOISE] -s for wealthy people. [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. [LAUGH]  And --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, mean that's my opinion.  I d- -- I don't -- I don't know.  What do you think?
R:  Well see, I'm -- I don't live close to any of that anyways so I never get to go.  I don't even know how much. --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] I know it's outrageous [NOISE] so 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Well, [LIPSMACK] I don't know.  See, I've --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- we've -- I've never even been to a game or anything.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Now, do [several inaudible words] --
R:  I just watch it on TV --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- every once in a while.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  We don't have any, um, major leagues around here.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  We're not too far from Chicago so -- and I have been to games in Chicago but [NOISE] [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] -- I just know that by the time you --
R:  [NOISE]  
L:  [NOISE] -- park and you pay your ticket and then you get something to eat, you know, --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] -- it can be well over two or three hundred dollars --
R:  Oh goodness.
L:  [NOISE] -- by the time you -- [SIGH] you know if you take two people or a couple and one child or something. [NOISE] 
R:  Wow.
L:  [NOISE] So -- and I think probably that's the result -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] -- of the owners wanting, you know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] -- to pay the -- they pay their players so much --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] -- and then they have to recoup their money.  So 
R:  Well, there's no reason for that.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  So, I don't know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] -- that's --
R:  Whoa.  [LAUGH] Hi, you scared me honey. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
R:  We're watching a scary movie in there. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Oh.  Oh dear. [LAUGH] 
R:  It's a shark, that --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [MN] Deep Blue Sea movie with the sharks.
L:  [NOISE] Oh.  I don't know that one.
R:  [MN] It's -- it's not really scary but the kids're really, "Woo". [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Oh. [LAUGH] The sharks are scary though.
R:  It's like the fifth or sixth --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- time we watched it.
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  [LAUGH] [MN]
L:  [NOISE] Oh, that's cool. 
R:  Well, [SIGH] let's --
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- see.
L:  [NOISE] I've ne- -- this is my first of these phone calls.  Have --
R:  Mm.
L:  [NOISE] -- you ever done one before?
R:  Yeah.  I've done ah --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- probably five. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] Oh really?
R:  And then my husband did about --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- five too and they called for him a lot and he was at work so we never answered that one.  And then they started calling for me again so, for a while they stopped.
L:  [NOISE] Hah.
R:  But I'm glad to see they came back. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Well, I had one --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] -- the other night and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] -- I was in the middle of watching something that I didn't want to -- so I just didn't accept the call.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] I had like ten minutes left on some season finale of something [LAUGH] that seemed to be way more important at the time. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] But um.  So, I don't know -- this is the -- my son got me into this and I uh didn't really know anything about it [SIGH] --
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  [NOISE] -- so you -- you actually --
R:  Go ahead.
L:  [NOISE] -- do get checks and so? [NOISE] 
R:  I haven't gotten 'em yet but I had -- did research on line to see if anybody had and there's people that have but it takes about a month or two.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  That's what he said.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Well, he had gotten them but [NOISE] -- anyway.
R:  I -- I do uh, secret shopping here in Louisiana and --
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  -- it takes a while --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  -- to get your checks like, probably a m- -- one of 'em's s- -- sixty days they'll cut you a check.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.  Wow.
R:  So it takes a while.
L:  [NOISE] [MN] 
R:  So it's probably the same deal.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  [MN] 
L:  [NOISE] Hm.  How often do you do that?
R:  [NOISE] I was supposed to do one today and I didn't feel good so I didn't go but [LAUGH] uh, I got one Saturday to do.
L:  [NOISE] Hm.
R:  Um, my area's small so I don't really have much but it's pretty -- it's a lot -- at least two or three a week I guess.
L:  [NOISE] Oh my goodness.
R:  But if I were in a bigger city I'd have 'em daily.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  It's really something y- -- you know, [NOISE] if you like -- like I -- I smoke cigarettes so [SIGH] every once in a while they'll tell me to go buy a pack of cigarettes um -- like um -- it'll prob- -- like they gave two of 'em.  I go to a store in Moss Bluff and I go to a store in Lake Charles here, and then uh buy a pack of cigarettes and I get --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- fifteen dollars -- wait, fifteen dollars, so for each one I got --
L:  [NOISE] Huh.
R:  -- I got a total of twenty eight dollars in the mail for going buy cigarettes. [SIGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Oh my goodness.
R:  Yeah.  And then we got to buy alcohol the other -- they asked us to buy --
L:  Oh.  
R:  -- alcohol so we went and did --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that one and they we got another twenty eight dollars for buying alcohol [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE] Oh my gosh.
R:  -- and then I went and shopped at Rite Aids --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- three different places.  I just bought a --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- pack of gum or something --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- cheap, and they paid me fifteen dollars for each one and I just got another thirty eight dollars today --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- for doing that. [SIGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Oh my word.
R:  And there's another one for, ah, [SIGH] a bus station -- I b- -- bought a ticket at a bus station but I didn't go anywhere.
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  And you just leave and they paid me fifty one dollars to do that.
L:  [NOISE] Oh my word.  Did you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] -- learn about this on line?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I --
R:  Look for um Secret Shopper or Mystery Shopping and it's -- 
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- it's all free.  Don't join anything.  They always -- they have some that want you to pay [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- but it's, uh, free. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] Hm.  Interesting.
R:  [NOISE] I have the web addresses somewhere.  I could look it for you [NOISE] to ah, see. [NOISE]  'Cause I had another lady I talked to 'cause I -- she lived in New York and I was like well -- she goes, "How did you find the number for this?" and I said, "Mystery Shopping" and she's like, "Ooh --"
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
R:  "-- I wanna do that.  I'm a college student and I need the money".
L:  [NOISE] Oh yeah.
R:  But it's good 'cause I c- -- I went to -- some of 'em like, is uh go to the mall and buy something --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- and [MN] so I got to get me a necklace, uh [LAUGH] --
L:  [NOISE] Oh my gosh.
R:  -- and they pay for it and they send you a little cheque for doing it.
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  But um --
L:  [NOISE] And then you have to report on the kind of service you get --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] -- and all that?  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] You just, uh, get on line and they have a little form you fill out. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.  Oh.
R:  [NOISE] And then you just tell them what [NOISE] -- you gotta kinda get everybody's name and [SIGH] so you gotta try to [SIGH] get your memory going good [LAUGH] --
L:  [NOISE] Right, yeah.
R:  -- of who you talk to and [SIGH] most of the time I'll just carry --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a little piece of paper and I'll write it down when they -- as soon as I can or --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- you know.  But gosh, there's one at Kroger's that they want me to do.  It's like you have to visit every single person in every department, get their name -- 
L:  [NOISE] Oh my word.
R:  -- [MN] and count how many people are in the [SIGH] -- at the check out and every check out.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  It's just a lot --
L:  [NOISE] Huh.
R:  -- so some of 'em are --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- hard.
L:  [NOISE] That one you w- -- you would earn your money with that one. [LAUGH] 
R:  And that one's the same price as the ones where you go and you just buy a pack --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of cigarettes so --
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE] Huh.
R:  It's a little bit difficult [SIGH] uh --
L:  [NOISE] [MN] 
R:  Let me see --
L:  [NOISE] -ll I'll have to look up Mystery Shopping or something --
R:  Mm yeah.
L:  [NOISE] -- and just see what it -- [SIGH] what it says.  [MN] 
R:  Oh.  Where's my little -- I'm looking for my little book 'cause I have it all written down.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I'll just give you the web addresses.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE] Hm.
R:  Here it is.  You got a pen?
L:  [NOISE] Sure.
R:  Okay.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Usually once I get going and talking it'll say, "Okay time's up" [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
R:  "Tell the person, 'Goodbye'".
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's what it'll do.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Okay.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Let's see uh 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  One of 'em's just W.W.W. [MN] dot mystery shoppers dot com.
L:  [NOISE] Shoppers?
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] Okay.
R:  [NOISE] Um.  Hey man- -- I wonder where the other ones are.  Ah, there's one that's mystery shop net dot com.
L:  [NOISE] Uh.
R:  Um.  [NOISE] Man.  Maybe I don't have them here with me.
L:  [NOISE] Well, maybe this is a start.  I can 
R:  And a M.S. [NOISE] -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] I think it's M.S.P.A. or something like that?
L:  [NOISE] Hm.
R:  That one's another one but -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] you just -- once you get going you can -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you look and it's not like you know, some people will be --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- advertising, trying to sell you something and it will be like a little --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it'll say --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- "For mystery shopping.  If you want to be a shopper and you want to go shopping and get paid to shop" and all this --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- that's the ones you don't click 'cause they're trying to sell you something.  The others would be like, "Mystery shoppers needed" [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  -- you know?  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Or something like that --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- and those are the free ones and --
L:  [NOISE] Good.
R:  -- that's where you're gonna get --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- something. [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, my husband works in a retail store and he says they have mystery shoppers --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] -- that come in and I don't know if they're affiliated with their store --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] -- or they're from a place like this, but --
R:  I don't think it matters 'cause I work for um -- like one of them wants me to get a cell phone --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R: -- and [NOISE] you had to have bad credit so they wanted me to get a cell phone and they c- -- you carry it for I think six or eight months --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and they pay for your phone, they pay for your bill and they give you extra money for having it.
L:  [NOISE] Oh my gosh.
R:  Yeah.  And I don't have a cell phone so I'm like, "Hey --"
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  That's a good deal.
R:  "-- that sounds good".
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Huh.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, sometimes they'll tell me to go get gas and I'll get gas for free and then --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- go and report it.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] It really helps.  If I weren't -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, not work, I could probably travel and do it and --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- be happy.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  No telling what -- some of them are [NOISE] theme parks -- you can go to the [NOISE] theme park --
L:  [NOISE] Huh.
R:  -- and uh --
L:  [NOISE] Well, sounds like it keeps you busy --
R:  -- they'll pay you to do that.  Yeah --
L:  [NOISE] -- doing interesting things.
R:  -- I do.  I stay busy. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Huh.
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] Well. 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] Do they -- what do they do with this?  I -- I mean are -- are we -- our conversation's recorded right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] So, they go back and listen all this -n?  Oh, well, we didn't hit the subject a whole lot but I think we did it as much as we could.
R:  Yeah.  It's kind of a hard one.
L:  [NOISE] It is --
R:  'Cause I don't know --
L:  [NOISE] -- for um --
R:  -- what else to say about it. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I -- I don't think -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] -- you know, I think there's a limited, uh, amount of --
R:  [NOISE] I know I read --
L:  [NOISE] -- that we --
R:  -- the -- the information.  It said, "Try to stick to the subject" --
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  -- so I guess we'll go back to that. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
