R:  Hi, my name is Tunise Robertson.
L:  Yes.  My name is Jenny.
R:  Nice to meet you Jenny.
L:  Hi.
R:  What's your last name?
L:  Yack.  Y.A.C.K.
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  Okay.
R:  Okay, so what do you think about the issues for today?
L:  Ah, I -- I couldn't understand her.  I was sitting outside on the porch, so I couldn't hear it very well.  Could you go over that with me again?
R:  Well, it was about the war in Iraq, and will there be peace ever -- will there be peace between us and you know, that kind of thing.
L:  Okay.  Okay, I can comment on that.
R:  Mhm.  Okay.
L:  You want me to?
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay.  Um, I -- I don't think we will ever have peace with that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I do not believe that the Palestinians and Is- -- Israel will ever have peace with their problem either.
R:  Yeah, I don't think so either.  Because I -- basically they've been taught to hate since they were little.  So 
L:  That's true.
R:  So, you know, but it would be great to have peace on earth for all nationalities, you know.
L:  That is true.
R:  And possibly looks like that's not going to happen until the world has ended and recreated.  And that's so sad, you know.  I like everybody.
L:  Right.  I do too.
R:  Yeah.  You sound like a nice person too.
L:  I am.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm a very good hearted person.
R:  Yeah.  And that --
L:  And um, but I do get angry --
R:  Oh yeah --
L:  -- I got very, very angry when they blew up the um, Twin Towers --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in New York.
R:  Yeah, that was sad.  Now that was very sad.
L:  That made me very angry, more than sad.
R:  Yeah, an- -- and -- and it was so sad because those people have families, you know, and they're human beings, they deserve to live.
L:  That's right.  And all the loved ones that were left behind.
R:  Yeah.  Just think about how sad it was --
L:  That, I was sad about.
R:  Oh yeah --
L:  That I was sad about --
R:  Ah, hm.
L:  -- But for them to go in there and have that entire, you know, mess or terrorism completely planned and completely set out with no-one having any clue that it was coming, that, you know, that made me mad.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, for being sad, I felt so sorry for the loved ones.  All the children that lost their mothers and fathers and, you know, all -- all the mothers and fathers that lost their children --
R:  When they --
L:  -- I mean --
R:  -- they thought it was going to be like any other day.  Mom comes home, cooks, you know.  In their little minds they didn't know any bet- -- you know.
L:  It's just terrible.  It was horrendous.
R:  Yeah, it was.  It was very bad.
L:  I think, you know, I don't know how old you are --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but um, I'm forty seven years old.
R:  Oh really?  I'm forty seven, too!
L:  You are?
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay.  In my life time I don't think I've ever seen anything that bad ever -- ever happen to our country.  Outside of John F. Kennedy being shot.
R:  Well, you know what, John F. Kennedy -- now that was a great tragedy to me and I still miss him today, as well as Clinton, but ah, you know, in my lifetime I never -- I never thought ever in life that I would be able to hear about planes, a whole plane crashing into a building!
L:  Three of 'em.
R:  Yes.  Those people, they must have -- you know, they were really mind bent on suicide and they felt it was the right thing to do, but that was hor- -- you know, I mean, how could you -- I -- I don't understand how could a person kill theirself like that.  You know it's coming, you see it's coming and you're all right with it.
L:  Well they're trained by their superiors to do that.
R:  That's bad.
L:  They're brainwashed by their superiors to do that.
R:  And that's so bad.
L:  And they do that willingly --
R:  And even the babies --
L:  -- for their superiors.
R:  Yeah, and they train 'em from kids, you know.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And that -- that's, you know, they -- so they've been hating all their life.  They're born to hate.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And they just don't understand the beauty of the world, that there are good people here that really care about them, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  And I -- I just thought that was really so sad.  Where -- where are you at?  In Cal- -- in California?
L:  Well you must know something.
R:  No.
L:  Because you said it.  "Are you from California?"
R:  Oh, we- -- I'm from LA.
L:  What do you know?  Do you get that from the computer?
R:  No, I just guessed, I guess.
L:  How did you guess?
R:  I don't know, I -- well, that's mainly what I say to people.  "Are you from Cali- -- are you from California?  Because I am".  And they'll generally say, "No, I'm from ", you know, if it's different.  But I was lucky and got the guess right this time.
L:  Yes, I am.  I live in California.  I'm not originally from California, but I moved out here for the weather.
R:  Oh, I'm, ah, in LA.  Los Angeles.
L:  I'm down in Ranch Hill, Santa Marguerita.
R:  Oh.
L:  Do you know where that is?
R:  No, I'm not familiar with it.  Is it near --
L:  Okay, it -- it's right in between LA and San Diego.
R:  Oh.
L:  I'm in Orange County.
R:  Oh, yeah, I go to Orange County every year for the fair.
L:  Oh yeah.  Okay, I'm not too far from that.
R:  Yeah, this year we're going July the fifteenth.
L:  Oh.
R:  But you know, back to the topic, ah, you know, something else that saddened me was I -- I spoke to a lady, day before yesterday on this same line --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and did this research and she was telling me that she had recently went to New York and that the smell was terrible from all the debris, and I told her, I said, "Yeah, because there's still flesh, you know, that was missing or whatever, and then the smell of flesh burning, that lasts a long time".  And um, she was saying it just looks so strange.
L:  And it's still there?
R:  Yes, and she said it looks so strange to know that lots of people, thousands and thousands lost their lives.  But you know, what was strange for me was because when I saw on TV that ball of smoke and fire just spreading all over and people running from it, that was something like that picture, Independence Day.
L:  Right.
R:  You know.  And I --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and then what really, ah, got me too, was when they showed the picture of the fire truck --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- fire was out the building had fell on it and it was all mangled up and some -- and they had the door in front of the fire department, as a, you know, showing a tribute to what happened and someone stole the door from off the fire department building!
L:  Oh, that's disgusting.
R:  Yeah, they stole it, and that's all they had left of memory of their coworkers, you know, of co-firemen.
L:  Oh, they were out there hunting for jewelry.  They were hunting for, like, capped teeth with the gold in them --
R:  Oh god.
L:  -- it -- it was sickening.  I mean, you know, if -- if what they did, Iraq or whoever it may have been, we still don't really know.
R:  Right.
L:  But whoever it may have been, if that wasn't bad enough, for people from our country to go stealing and robbing from -- from such a, um, destructive site[?], against our government --
R:  Exactly, exactly.
L:  -- I mean, I -- that was a disgrace, to me.
R:  It was.  It was.  And it was very disrespectful to the people that lost their lives.
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know, I feel that, ah, they could -- that, you know, that may have been just one piece more that their loved ones had to remember them by, the last piece, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it was too, um -- I really, really, every night I pray that world -- for world peace too, but I pray that those people, you know, because you never really get over someone that you love and have lost, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I just pray that they get through it, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  And that they be all right.
L:  Right.
R:  And I pray that the people that lost their lives, that their spirits are, well, you know.  But then too, I think about those people that hit the ground over there near um, the Pentagon where the -- the -- where the plane just nosed under, you know, and I think about them, that -- that plane, when it hit the ground it just totally disintegrated --
L:  Right.
R:  -- there was nothing left.
L:  Right.
R:  And I know that must have been very horrible for the people inside their plane.  Especially the pilots to -- to see -- to see it coming, you know.
L:  Right.  And they knew it was going to happen.
R:  Yeah, they know, and -- and --
L:  And you know, what I thought, too, was all those courageous people on the plane that went down in Pennsylvania --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the courage that it took them.  Because that plane was definitely going to go to the White House, in my mind.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Because they had it for strat- -- strategically -- you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- o- -- operated or, um, you know --
R:  Designed, yeah.
L:  -- it was all planned.
R:  And I -- I really salute the fire department all over the world, because it lets you know that's just one of the highest episodes they go through, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  As far as losing their lives in fires, I think they're very courageous too.
L:  I do too.
R:  I really do.  I -- I salute them very much --
L:  I do too.  And I think -- I applaud everyone in New York that pulled through that and, I mean -- I mean, I think these people out here in California would have gone completely
