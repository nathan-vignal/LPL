L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Yes, ah, my name in Robyn Kemp.
R:  Hi Robyn, my name is Melody.
L:  Nice to meet you Melody.
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  Um, this is my first time doing this.
R:  Okay, well this is my second so, um, we just usually talk for about ten minutes and -- about the subject which is of course, today, it's heightened security in the airport system.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, where are you from?
L:  I am from Texas.
R:  From Texas?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  My very good friend lives in Texas.
L:  Oh really?
R:  Yeah.  She lives, um, in the Huston area.
L:  Oh, okay, I'm -- my husband's from that area.
R:  Oh okay.
L:  Yeah, and I'm from east Texas, so 
R:  Oh, and ah, I'm in South Carolina, so 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- on the coast.
L:  Um, I guess -- I guess we ought to talk about airport security.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, have you flown recently?
R:  Um, I have flown recently and I have felt, ah, tried to escort one of my children through just, ah, since nine eleven, so yes.  How about you?
L:  Okay.  Yes, I have and um, I've had to do -- I did that last summer and I'm going to have to do that again with my daughter --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and my niece, going to summer camp.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, um, and we fly out of the Atlanta airport.  Um, we live --
R:  Oh okay.
L:  -- we live in Atlanta and um, so far it, ah, has gone fairly smoothly.  We haven't gotten caught up in hours and hours of waiting, ah, luckily, and um, but as -- you know, as far as your opinion as to do you think it's, um, prevented any bombings or ?
R:  Um, I can't say that it's prevented any, um, you know, because there's been people caught after the fact --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- actually on the aeroplanes, um, that have had explosive devices, or whatever, on them, um, like -- like you, I have not actually been, um, caught in any really long lines, um, I did -- well, I went to Hawaii last year and on my way back from Hawaii and on my way to Hawaii, when we stopped over at LA, um, if we went outside for what little fresh air they have -- yeah --
L:  [LAUGH] That's true.  I've been there. [LAUGH] 
R:  It's just -- you know, it was just a real pain to get through airport security that way, but I feel like once you get past that checkpoint the, um, the risk of se- -- security is not as, ah, the security being breached is um, not as high as it norm- -- as it used to be --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but again, there -- there's still -- we didn't hear a whole lot about these -- these things happening prior to nine eleven and since nine eleven it's, like, if it happens, you're going to hear about it regardless.
L:  Exactly.  And it's happened here in Atlanta.  Ah, there was, I think one of the first incidents I remember hearing about was the -- when the um, when there was like, a guy, I guess in his thirties, with his son, he forgot a camera or something on the plane and he jumped off and ran back and got it or -- do you remember that incident?  Um --
R:  We didn't hear about that one.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, they shut down the whole airport.
R:  Oh yeah.  Well I know they, I mean --
L:  It was something really stupid.
R:  Yeah, that -- they tend to went -- they went a little crazy right afterwards, and I -- and I can understand that too, um, but ah, it -- it they um, there was a airport up in um, Kentucky that they shut down as well, for something similar to that, um I don't know the specifics about it, but that was when it was first, you know, they -- FAA hadn't set the guidelines down about what you're supposed to check and what you're not supposed to check and, you know 
L:  Right, right.  I just recently flew, um, into New York with my son --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they checked him much closer than me.  I felt like, um, if he had anything on him they would have found it, ah, as far as going.  But on the trip back they checked me in the same manner, and didn't hardly check him at all.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  And, ah, I -- I you know, I had to almost completely strip, not strip, but I mean there was no way I could have had anything on me.
R:  Oh yeah, I'm the same way.
L:  Yeah, and ah, but in some -- in that New York airport, you know, I feel like the heightened sense of security is a little m- -- you know, tighter than it is in Atlanta.  Just from the --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- it felt like, when I was there.
R:  Well, and with the area and everything too, so yeah, I agree with you there.  I know, um, one of the things that bothers me when they're -- they're checking for this is like, my daughter flew for the first time last summer and inevitably, it doesn't matter what I'm doing or where I'm at, or I could -- I could be wearing nothing but a bathing suit, I'm going to set off the metal detector.
L:  Oh.
R:  I don't know why.
L:  Hm.
R:  Or anything, but she was terrified when they started, you know, you've got to stand on the two feet and take your shoes off and she was just looking at me like, am I going to be able to go see my father, and I'm like, we're fine. [LAUGH] It'll okay, I do this every time. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, they did that to my son, it kind of freaked me out.  I mean, he had to completely take his belt apart.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I just thought, wow, you know, I hope we get through New York, and there --
R:  What -- what are you going to put in your belt?
L:  Oh, I know.  I mean he -- he's gotta keep his pants on.
R:  And I can relate to that one, I literally, when I go through a metal detector I walk through with my hands up because I know what's going to happen.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  They -- they look -- yeah, they look at me like I'm strange and funny, and I'm like, I'm telling you, I have to metal on me, nothing on me, but I'm going to set this thing off so go ahead and get your little hand wand and get your little feet ready for me, but --
L:  Wow.  And I'll take off my jacket, I mean, the whole thing.  That is wild.
R:  Exactly.  Yep, so, I um, I -- I feel like they're doing a better job at what they used to do.
L:  Right.
R:  Because before, they were very lax in their security procedures.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, and -- but I think now that the FAA have stepped in and said, if you let these items fly through, it's your job.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  So, I think they're -- they're a little bit, ah, they're actually earning their money now.
L:  Right.
R:  Whereas before they were just like, okay, well come on through, well that looks like a [inaudible] but I'm not sure.
L:  Well yeah, and even when we checked baggage, like that -- my -- my dad and step mom just came in for my son's graduation, but they really were serious about what was in their bags --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and every time, they have gone through their bags.  They put little labels on your bags when they go through it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they went through every one of their bags.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well I -- I was fortunate, I only got -- I only got um -- my bags only got physically searched one time, and of course, that was at LA, and um --
L:  Oh wow.
R:  -- yeah, and that was on the way to Hawaii.
L:  Yeah, I -- I've seen that happen to people, it hadn't happened to me at the airport, you know, when they just take 'em right -- did they you right there and search it in front of you?
R:  Oh yeah, they did it right there in front of me, because th- -- they'll ask you, "Do you mind if we search your bag?"  And you know, you look round and say well, what if I say no?  What are they going to do?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah.  Well, see they don't even -- they don't tell you they're going to at -- at the Atlanta airport, or I guess, other airports too, they just do it and they tag it and tell you they have done it.
R:  Oh wow, see that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- every place that I have seen them do it they -- they've asked, um here at the Charleston Airport --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah, th- -- the LA Airport and, um, even in Hawaii, at the Honolulu Airport, so 
L:  They checked them at every -- one of them went through my bag[?] I -- I you know, the first time I saw that happen to someone else, I was thinking, wow, they're really serious and these people were close to missing their flight.
R:  Yeah.  That -- I mean, I'm paranoid about not being on time some place so when this all started and I was like, I don't know, flight leaves at eight that means we're going to have to be at the airport at five.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just so we can get a parking spot and get through the line in time.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And you know, it upsets me that now, if you have a child traveling, if you have more than one in your family that whole family can't see your child off.  If there -- if there --
L:  They can't go through the security gate.
R:  -- right.  You can only have a parent -- one parent can go through --
L:  Right.
R:  -- is what they -- they'd like and I just, you know, that just --
L:  And then you have to have special per- -- permission slip, I thought last summer we had to get a permission slip to do that, to go --
R:  Oh y- -- yeah, you do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, you ha- -- you have to have a special boarding pass and a special pass to get to the boarding area.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, um, but yeah, it was, um, it was definitely an experience sending my child off for the first time on a plane, and um, all the paper work I had to go through to -- to get everything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So 
L:  And you know, we did that, ah, chaperoning, where you pay the thirty bucks for each leg, to have them chaperoned and stuff --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but you know, I don't think that makes them any safer. [LAUGH] 
R:  That -- that doesn't.  I mean, um, you know, and my daughter was thirteen at the time and I didn't pay for her to have that because she only had one lay over, and um, they told me that they would make sure that she would get to the right place, anyhow, and, um, of course I -- I immediately assumed, I said, as soon as you hit Kentucky you better call me. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  And if you miss your plane, you better call me.
L:  Right, and -- and she got there okay?
R:  Oh yes, she got there just fine.
L:  Well my son did that for five years, now my daughter's doing it, you know, he's grown now, for going to camp --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- changing -- but ah, changing legs and stuff --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and he always did fine.  We had him chaperoned once or twice and then after that we didn't.
R:  Yeah, I think after that it's okay because they know, um --
L:  Right, what they gotta do.
R:  -- exactly, exactly.  We're -- we're battling this year getting ready to try and plan and figure out what we're going to do and
