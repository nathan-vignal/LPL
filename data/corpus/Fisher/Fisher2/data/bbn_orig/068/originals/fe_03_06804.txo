L:  Y- have to be real quiet. 
R:  [NOISE] Hi. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  +Hello. 
L:  [NOISE] +Hello.  This is Marie Schmitz from Minnesota. [NOISE] 
R:  Hi Marie.  My name is Marla Martin and I'm from --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- Charleston, West Virginia.  How are you?
L:  [NOISE] Well, fine.  I couldn't hear what they said the topic was all about.  About actors? [NOISE] 
R:  I think -- I had to listen twice -- I think it -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it's -- it's athletes --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- professional athletes --
L:  [NOISE] Oh, athletes. 
R:  -- um, how we feel about -- ah --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- their recent strike, number one --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  -- and whether or not we feel they should be paid the salaries that they're paid.
L:  [NOISE] Okay.  That's what it was -- kinda what I was thinking then too.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Definitely not. [LAUGH] [MN] 
R:  Well -- I mean I -- I guess I agree --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that you should be paid for talent an' --
L:  [NOISE] Right.  But --
R:  -- I mean to some extent. [LAUGH] 
L:  But not this -- they're getting a --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- [NOISE] a very -- I mean, a really high salary.
R:  Yeah.  It- it's a little exorbitant, especially when you --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- have um -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- so much waste in this country and so many people in need.  It's --
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  -- it's a little outrageous.  I don't know about --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- where you're fr- -- you're from but 
L:  [NOISE] Well, we're from Minnesota here and they're trying to get that dome --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- through [NOISE] really big time.  But they want the taxpayers to --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- pay it [NOISE] and not the owners of these [NOISE] guy- -- I mean the owners of the teams --
R:  Of the teams.
L:  -- like the twins and stuff.  And they're making all this money --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and they want us taxpayers to pay it. 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  So that's -- that's what makes it really hard because -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- sure I can see u- -- having a dome and stuff like that, but let them pay some of it [NOISE] because they're --
R:  Yeah.  Well, I mean -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- because they're the ones that --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- yeah, the cities --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- court them.  Of course --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- yeah, I understand that --  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- we don't have -- we only have a semi pro baseball team here.
L:  [NOISE] Mm.
R:  But I'm originally from Pittsburgh --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um, so, you know -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I have lived in a city --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that has pro teams.  But the -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- cities, ah -- e- even our little city --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [MN] for 'em to have this farm team -- and I guess it's --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- with the uh --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I -- I guess they're a farm team for the Baltimore Oriels --
L:  [NOISE] Mm. [NOISE] 
R:  -- um -- you know the city gives them so many tax breaks and --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  -- makes it so attractive for them to locate here.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Um -- you know it is -- it's -- and I know the major cities --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- do the same.  They guarantee them -- you know --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- um [MN] so mu- -- you know that -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they're gonna have so many seats filled --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- every season and things like that 'n -- and uh --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- yeah.  They -- they get enough incentive that I don't feel [NOISE] --
L:  And -- [NOISE] 
R:  -- that ah -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know -- the taxpayers should have to -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- to foot the bill for the -- the stadiums and such.
L:  [NOISE] [MN] Well, I don't even -- I don't even mind some of it --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but when they want us to build the whole thing, it --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that's a lot.
R:  Mm.
L:  I mean, that's just -- it's crazy because [NOISE] the -- the owners of these teams, they're the ones that are really making the money. [NOISE]  The owners.  In fact the owners make a lot more than the players really.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  You know.  They're the ones that --
R:  Probably when all is said and done they probably do --
L:  [NOISE] Right 'cause -- [NOISE] 
R:  -- because don't the networks pay them a certain amount of money to carry games and such?
L:  [NOISE] I think so.
R:  I think they do as well.
L:  So -- s- [NOISE] right.  So they are -- 
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- they're getting a lot of extras [NOISE] all the time.  And even like the [NOISE] concession stands -- I used to think that went to certain things, but it all goes back [NOISE] into their type of stuff.  [NOISE] You know, they're --
R:  Is it really?  
L:  Well -- [NOISE] 
R:  They're not owned by individuals?
L:  Yeah, [NOISE] because they make so much -- and like we had lost ah -- um -- that one hockey team to Texas [NOISE] -- so we lost them.  Well, now we got a new hockey team [NOISE] and we built a new type of, ah, place for them.  Well -- duh -- the Nor- -- not the North Stars -- used to be the North Stars, [NOISE] now it's the Wild --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, they -- they brought -- I mean -- a lot of money into our area granted.  A lot of money to the --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- restaurants and all that stuff.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  But they still -- they made tons and tons of money because people were paying high bucks to go see 'em because they were a winning team.  [NOISE] So then they were there -- there was just -- I mean they were getting a lot of money and those guys did not get paid a lot of money and they were happy.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] They're one of the lowest paid, they said, in the nation -- [NOISE] for the Wild those -- I mean, now I'm sure they'll get more because they're good.  [NOISE] But they were not making any money and, ah, they were as happy as can be --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- [NOISE] and the fans here just loved 'em.  I mean, it was just -- I mean -- and I think fans would like 'em a lot more if they thought, "Hey, [NOISE] you're more like us".  Because they make so much more than -- like doctors --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- who are [NOISE] -- who are saving lives.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Yeah -- and they're making mega bucks and -- that's 
R:  Right.  I mean --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I -- I understand too, for a lot of these guys, you know their [MN] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- their careers are very short lived because they can't -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they can't put up the stress -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the physical endurance for -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for too long.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  But in terms of their strikes -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um -- you know I really [NOISE] -- I can't understand --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- w- what they're -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- why [SIGH] -- why what they want is so crucial that they stop a season that's only a few months out of every year --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  -- disappoint all the fans and -- you know th- -- during the last strike um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I read an article in the Pittsburgh newspaper -- it really -- y- know I couldn't care less for the ball players -- they got enough money to last through a strike and then some --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  -- most of them have enough money in the bank to last them --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the rest of their life times, but -- um -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the people who depend upon --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the teams or the stadiums being open for a living just was amazing.  Um -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the guys who dry [NOISE] clean the uniforms.
L:  [NOISE] Oh yes.
R:  They took such a big hit.  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know those kinds of people.  And at least in Pittsburgh -- I guess it's different than in Minnesota -- 
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- but in Pittsburgh some of those -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- vending places in the stadium are individually owned. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And, you know, those people --
L:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.  And all --
R:  -- 'course th- there went their whole season.
L:  [NOISE] Sure.  All the people that sell their mel- -n -- y- know their shirts and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- all that type of stuff --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  All that type of stuff was hit by --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it.  All of the places around where they played, like the -- the restaurants and the bars and all that.
R:  Right, right.
L:  That all -- I mean [NOISE] it's -- it took a lot of people out of work, you know, and they don't realize that.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, they're not -- [NOISE] they're not thinking about that because they're thinking about themselves.  And I -- did they even get anything out of it? [NOISE] [PAUSE] Are you there?
R:  That I don't know --
L:  Oh.  Oh.
R:  -- I don't know enough about --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah see --
R:  -- sports to give you any answer on that but it --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I would think -- I don't think it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- unreasonable if I were the --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- commissioner of -- of these sports organizations -- I don't think it's --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  "-- unreasonable to say, "Hey, for the amount of money we're paying you, there is a no strike clause in your contract". [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] I thought there used to be.  
R:  [NOISE] "You know --"
L:  [NOISE] Yeah I 
R:  "-- if you want to go out on strike, great, you lose this much money per year".
L:  [NOISE] Right.  
R:  [MN] 
L:  That's what they should do --
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  -- because -- you know, instead of putting so many people out, that way they would -- it would only hurt them or something too.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, if they wanted to go and they could just [NOISE] drop off just that person or something. [NOISE] 
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  But I -- they -- I dunno -- they just get away with it.  Well, now like that, ah, young kid though now too I just was reading in the paper.  He's not even a big star yet.  He's a basketball player.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Nike is giving him I forgot how many millions --
R:  Who's that, Iverson?
L:  [NOISE] [MN] I don't know what his name is.  He's just out of [NOISE] a college or high school.
R:  Huh.
L:  He's -- he's very young and he's making so much money [NOISE] because Nike's paying him.  [NOISE] And then he went and bought -- he wasn't supposed to be doing it but he went and bought a car or his -- they turned up -- they said his mother bought a car.  [NOISE] It was in the paper --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- because he wasn't supposed to be doing that -- y- know -- having all this money.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  Well, he's -- he's getting millions of [NOISE] dollars and he's so young.  
R:  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  I mean -- he does- -- he hasn't even really played anywhere yet --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] -- and they're paying salary like that. [NOISE] 
R:  And all these endorsements and stuff.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  That's why I guess pr- -- they probably make -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know -- even -- e- -- their salaries are high enough --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- but I bet they probably make a ton --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- off of these endorsements.
L:  [NOISE] Oh and they do even after they're -- like you were saying before -- [NOISE] that is they're short lived.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  They are short lived but then they go into selling other stuff after they're done.  So they're still making a lot of money.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] You know, so they're still, ah, doing a lot.  I just saw Kent Herbeck -- he was our baseball player for all those years and then he got older and stuff.  I saw him on commercials now [NOISE] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I think, "My goodness, they're -- they still make money".
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, they're [NOISE] still -- they make their money while they're young [NOISE] and strong, but they still make money afterwards, just for their name. [NOISE] [MN] 
R:  Well, y- know, 'course -- Pittsburgh of course has always been a big football town and -- um -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- well, you remember, uh, Carl Lee, don't you?
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  We- he used to play up in Minnesota?
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  Y- know, Carl Lee is -- is from our town. [LAUGH] This is his hometown.
L:  [NOISE] Mm.
R:  Um.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  He -- in fact he's now a coach --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- down here in West Virginia, but, um, the point I wanted to make was -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the Steelers -- when I was growing up --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the Steelers that won the four Super Bowls --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- those guys --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- back then, they all --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- had a profession that they could fall back on.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  They had either a business venture, an education or something.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Andy Russell had, um -- I think he had a degree in business administration --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, um, you know, he ran a -- a -- a 
L:  [NOISE] I think most of them do.
R:  Y- well some of -- you know -- [MN] I dunno.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Some of them I think go by -- get through college on the skin of their teeth.  Some of them don't, [NOISE] you know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- don't even finish school.  They go ahead and they take that professional player -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah -- ah, eligibility --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- and don't finish college.  But, you know, Rocky Blair -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- all of these guys had something solid to --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- fall back on.  I can remember going to Birmingham for years and seeing Bart Star Ford -- you know --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- he uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- did the -- the Ford dealership.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I don't see these guys having that same work ethic.
L:  [NOISE] No. [NOISE] 
R:  You may have remembered, ah, somebody named Major Harris who was a stand out --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- college player who went to -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- he wanted the money -- he wanted --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the money -- wanted the money -- and I -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't remember why it didn't work --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- out for him in pro ball.  I think -- oh I know why -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- he took an offer with the Canadian Football League and left college.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Didn't finish college --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and 'course, you know the Canadian Football League was a big disaster.
L:  [NOISE] Mm.
R:  Um --
