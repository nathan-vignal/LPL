R:  Hi, this is Natalie.
L:  Hi, this is Linda, how --
R:  Linda.
L:  -- you doing? [NOISE]
R:  I'm good.  Yourself?
L:  I'm fine. 
R:  Oh, good.  D- do you think heightened airport security decreases the chance of terrorism?
L:  Well, um, I definitely do.  Um, I think that anything they can do will help --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, the more the better.  How 'bout yourself?
R:  Um, I think it does, I'm not -- I think there are some things they just do to make us feel comfortable.
L:  Mhm --
R:  And some things --
L:  -- such as what?
R:  What?
L:  Such as what?
R:  Ah --
L:  Like those questions you get at the gate? [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Did anybody watch your bags, and ...?
R:  That -- I don't think that -- that does anything --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that they could probably let alone, um, [COUGH] that -- that's specific -- that's for helping us, I think -- I think they -- they choose not to trust, th- they don't have the kind of staff whose instincts they can trust.  So, instead of getting a sense of who might be safe or dangerous, they have to check everyone. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  When they're wanding my two year old son, I think that, ah, that may be sometimes a little overkill.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  But then I guess there are also people who would use a two year old child that way.
L:  Right, right.  Um, well, I guess, you know, do you agree with profiling at all? [MN]
R:  Well, some --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- some.  Not a hundred percent, I don't think that's the whole story.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  But especially in this particular situation, there's a, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, there's -- there's a call for it, I think -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that should be part of instinct, but if you don't have trained people with trained intuitions then you -- you need rules --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so that, um, anybody can follow --
L:  Right --
R:  -- them.
L:  -- right.
R:  Do you believe in profiling?
L:  I do.  I do, I think that if there's good enough reason, and, you know, that, um, there's a certain demographic type, in -- in, you know, in this current instance, I'd say terrorism, but I'd say if you're, [NOISE] um, you know, you're looking at maybe at Middle Eastern people and so on and so forth, you know, it makes sense versus looking at, you know, a ninety year old woman who doesn't fit the -- the demographic [NOISE] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to look a little more carefully at a someone's baggage and, you know, I guess it's the price we pay for, you know, living in a free society, is having to, you know, just kind of put up with some things in order to maintain [NOISE] our safety.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And hopefully, you know, when the terrorist, ah, [NOISE] alert goes down, you know, whenever that may be, you know, we can kinda go back to, [NOISE] you know, just the way things were, but for now, while terrorism is such a threat, I think that, you know, if I have to wait a little extra for them to look at my shoes or [NOISE] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [LAUGH] somebody --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- is gonna be, you know, profiled, I guess that's just what we have to do at the moment.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I -- I don't think you should have to do it forever.  
R:  I hope not.  I mean, the worst case -- m- my worst fear is that these methods are taken up by --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- different enemies, if you will --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and so then --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, although it's Middle Eastern -- largely Middle Eastern people who are using these --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- these kinds of threats now, no -- nothing to stop some other group from --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a- attacking in the same way --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in the future.  So, I guess that's an argument against profiling --
L:  Right --
R:  -- but ...
L:  -- but I guess if you, you know, you have to do -- you have to increase security all around and then if there's something, you know, that will help you prevent the kind of attacks that have happened in the past, then you kinda go with that as well.
R:  Sure.
L:  But it doesn't mean you, you know, let everybody else just go by and, you know, don't check anything out, um, but I -- I think probably, you know, the US probably has a -- I know from people travelling to Europe, and England even, they're even stricter there with everybody, um, looking at technology, like computers and cameras.  I think they inspect it a little more thoroughly and I would be fine with that as well --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- looking at everybody's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- personal belongings and I think they're taking steps and nothing's, you know, one hundred percent, but you have to do whatever you can.
R:  I think that they are trying and I -- I -- I also hope that they're not focusing so much attention on what could happen in an airport that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they miss dangers that could happen some place else.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  I -- my -- myself, if I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- wanted to, ah, create a problem, I wouldn't choose an airport next.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, so ...
L:  Right, I guess it's, you know, part -- part of it is, you know, part is anticipating, but also part is preventing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- things from the past, so it would be -- on the one hand you don't wanna overlook but -- overlook other things, but on the other hand you have to say, "Well, we don't want that same thing to happen again, so --"
R:  Right.
L:  "-- it would be stupid not [NOISE] to step up and improve what [NOISE] we know failed in the past". 
R:  Mhm, mhm. 
L:  Things like that, I don't know, I mean, and part of it is probably, you know, just, ah, checking identification more carefully and knowing who's going in and out of the airports and --
R:  I'd like to see them compare that information that they've talked about to other information, like, who may be on an expired student visa --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or, um, some other kind of a risk or a watch list.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Having a list of the names of people who were on a plane, ah, is not useful if, you know, come to find out that someone on that list c- caused a red flag --
L:  Right.
R:  -- before that.
L:  Definitely. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you travel a lot --
R:  Ah --
L:  -- by plane?
R:  -- I do travel fairly often by plane.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Maybe eight or ten times a year.
L:  Do you feel safer now than you did?  A- as far as terrorism and, you know, not plane crashes, I guess there's nothing we can do about that right now, but ...
R:  I didn't worry a lot before and I -- and I guess it's -- I feel a little safer now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Certainly it never occurred to me before September eleventh that something could happen on a plane.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, I know it did happen, and that things did happen on planes before --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I never [MN] anticipated that something might -- the scariest time was flying into Washington D.C. earlier this year and no one is allowed to stand up on the plane --
L:  Right.
R:  -- for half an hour before -- do you fly a lot, too?
L:  Um, I used to, yeah.  Not so much now, but for last job I did. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, it -- so you didn't stop because you're worried, you're ju- -- 'cause your job changed?
L:  Yeah, just jobs, that's all. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you -- do you -- and do you worry when you fly?
L:  Ah, not so much, no.  And I think I prob- -- like, one of the main reasons I probably feel safer now than I did, not that I -- not that I felt necessarily unsafe, but I would feel safer just because I think people, too, are more aware, just the regular passengers, of what's going on, and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, I think, you know, September eleventh, you know, people didn't under- -- you know, people would never have imagined a hijacking with the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- purpose of crashing into a building.  Now, I didn't think that, you know, people would take it without a fight --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- would let it happen without a fight and, um, you know.  I think that that too, just trusting in other people and hoping that maybe have a federal marshal on your plane, but there's, ah, you know, better training of the flight attendants, better awareness of the -- the people then --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, the possibility that you're even have extra protection on the plane, I think all of those things together would probably increase my --
R:  Yeah, you make a --
L:  -- sense of safety.
R:  -- you make a good point and -- and certainly people who would -- who never thought, "What would I do if something --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- happened on my plane?" have probably thought that through a little bit --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- and -- and feel prepared.
L:  Definitely. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, um, I feel -- you know, I don't feel particularly unsafe in an airport, at least anywhere compared to, you know, any other place where I could be a potential target.  I mean, I used to live in D.C. too and it was, ah, you know, I don't know, I think I felt safer after September eleventh knowing that, um, you know, we probably were more aware of what was going on, so I think it applies to not just airline safety, but that awareness everywhere against --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- terrorism.
R:  And, but before September eleventh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- had you ever occurred -- had it every occurred to you that some particular place or event could be a target?
L:  No.  I never would have thought about it before.
R:  Me -- 
L:  I mean, not on a gra- -- not -- not consciously anyway.
R:  Maybe after Oklahoma City in a federal building or something --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but yeah, i- it just would never occur to me.
L:  Right, right.
R:  But I used to work in, um, in the carnival business and I developed a certain fear of mobs, of what could happen if a lot of people were drinking and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- might get wild in a -- in an amusement park, not a -- not a targeted thing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, like, a fight could break out and people could, you know, be hurt -- collateral damage, kind of thing.  But I -- never would have occurred to me that before those events that somebody --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- would intentionally --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- attack those places. 
L:  Right.
R:  And then I -- I guess I'm kinda quick to forget it again.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I mean, it -- you know, it's also, you really don't know, you know, you never know how much, you know, any of the terrorist measures -- prevention measures are working, you know, you don't know how many things are actually prevented --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or how many people are stopped.  You know, the only way you'd know if it works or not is if, you know, something actually happens.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, you know, you have to trust that everything's working so far.  We've had -- fortunately not another major incident, so I have to say that [NOISE] you probably think that, you know, some things are working in our airports, considering we've been pretty safe so far.
R:  I think so and -- and -- and you've no -- also have no way of knowing how people might have tried something and now ju- -- it's too hard --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they were just deterred.
L:  Mhm, and I think it's not just, you know, air- --
