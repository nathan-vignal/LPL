L:  Hi, this is Donna.
R:  Hi Donna, my name is Coral.
L:  Um, oh, we're supposed to talk about the Middle East and[?] women.
R:  Mm.  Middle East and women?
L:  Yeah.  That was the first thing they said to me.
R:  Okay, I co- -- I didn't hear them too good when she say this.
L:  So, as far as the situation in the Middle East 
R:  Oh, with +Hussein and all them folk.
L:  What?
R:  What ah, what's his name, +Hussein and all them folks.
L:  I can't hear you.  Anyway --
R:  I said -- I said, +Hussein.  Is his name +Hussein?  Whatever his name is.
L:  Yeah the war[?] like, do you think there's ever going to be peace in the Middle East?
R:  [PAUSE] I don't know.  I really don't know.
L:  Yeah, I mean, as far as -- I mean, my theory was, I mean, is, like, a few years ago for a class, we read this book about um, this guy who in -- it was like a [inaudible] thing, and he was um, following this journey that these monks had taken, like, two thousand years ago or something.  Probably not two thousand, but like, fifteen hundred years ago in the Middle East, and um, and at that time they were all at war.  And they've been at war over there since forever.
R:  Well you know, the bible speaks about war.  Everyone was at war.
L:  Right, right.  And that's the whole thing, I mean --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- the whole, yeah, I'd say the holy[?] wars that go now --
R:  And as you know in -- and really, you know, if you read, because we were studying not too long ago in bible camp, and that's what -- that's where they were fighting and going on, over there.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because I know there's like, a huge thing, like, with Bethlehem, you know --
R:  Yeah, that's so.
L:  -- and -- and all these [inaudible] and, I mean, the immoral[?] thing is that we don't have any comprehension really, of what's going on over there.
R:  Right.
L:  And, you know, there's -- I mean, I know a lot of it's about [inaudible] and, I mean, maybe that's just -- just -- I mean, we got in it because of monetary interests, or some- -- you know, but I think that, you know, I don't think things are -- for the people over there I don't think they're any different now.
R:  All I know is a lot of people have been sick and shipped way over there [several inaudible words] he's in the reserves --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now they've [inaudible] and he's been gone two months and she hadn't even heard from him, she said.
L:  Oh my god.
R:   So, you know, I'm -- just taking people out of their home and shipping 'em somewhere --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- 'cause like, ah, my [several inaudible words] was -- when it -- when it broke out, what, about four or five years ago --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and there was fighting going on, they sent 'em over there, you know, and all of them came back with that virus --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what it -- ah -- oh, I can't think of the name of it now.
L:  I can't either, but I know what you're talking about --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they're like, oh no, nothing's wrong.
R:  Yeah, and then they -- they said they contracted it from when they was over there -- Desert Storm, that's what it was.
L:  Yeah, the Desert Storm thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, I know, I have a couple of friends that were over there, and um, but they don't talk about it.
R:  Mm.
L:  You know.  But I think a lot of times, you know, people don't talk about things.  That -- 'cause they just don't know how to explain it to you.
R:  And then they'd be true.
L:  You know.
R:  Or they -- they don't want to remember.
L:  You know -- yeah, but it -- yeah it is.  It's just a, you know, and I think a lot of it too, I mean, like, with [COUGH] you know, with this -- with this -- this last [inaudible] and you know, and how the country's always, you know, have been for, I don't know, for --
R:  And then you think about this, they're going over there to fight, but then every time you go into a -- a -- a hotel or a motel or a gas station, who got 'em?  The Iranians, see what I'm saying?  They -- they -- you know, they run a whole lot of stuff over here now.
L:  Yeah, they do.  They -- you know, and y- -- yeah, I think, you know, I think there's a -- I mean, there's so much that we -- that we don't know about, you know, the um, like, you know, and I think about like, I'm in Minneapolis.  I don't know where you are?
R:  [inaudible] Tennessee.
L:  Yeah, I figure it.  You sound southern. [LAUGH] Um, you know, but you know, I mean, like, we have a lot of immigrants here, you know.
R:  Yeah, we -- it's a whole -- this is a smaller town, it's like an hour's drive from Memphis and it -- I mean the gas stations, the hotels, and then like, you know, and -- and the nails, oh, we got about -- usually there's one, and then there's like, six of 'em, where you can go and get your nails done.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So you know what I'm saying, you got a whole lot of 'em coming from Iraq and Arabians and different people is coming over but they -- they over there, they're fighting and going on trying to free some of them people up so they can live the way they want to live and -- Bush didn't go himself.  He just sent -- he didn't send his people, so -- there was this woman coming down the street and she -- she got two kids and she's working trying to pay all the bills and -- and do the -- you know, he'll -- she has to do all this stuff when she gets home because he's way over there somewhere.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It -- it's hard just being a single parent by yourself anyway.
L:  Well of co- -- yeah, and I mean, that's -- but you know, and -- and I think, yeah, and I think a lot of it too is, you know, going back to like, this whole like, you know, you know, like -- like I know a few people that were um, they were in the reserves and they got called up --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but god knows where they are.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But the whole reserve thing, I mean, I'm [inaudible]. I mean, people -- when they join it they're like, oh yeah, there's like one chance in a gazillion, you know what I mean. 
R:  Yeah. [several inaudible words]
L:  And there is a -- I mean, there is a thing like, when you, you know, look at Bush, okay and he comes from money, like, way old money and everything else.  Well of course, his kids aren't going anywhere.  You know.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  And you know, and -- and all those people that make decisions, it's not their kids.
R:  Yeah.  I was watching TV and they was talking -- this is when it first happened, and this guy, they were showing people that -- that people had friends or relatives that got sent over there, and this man, he was just in tears.  He told the reporter[?] he said, "You took my only son."
L:  Yep.
R:  "My only son."
L:  You know, and then, yeah, and then you get, you know, and then you get people saying well they should never have enlisted -- you know what I mean, if they weren't prepared to go, and you're like, yeah, well they had a lot of choice, like, they got a free ride to like, Yale, you know. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  But I mean, like, yeah, I mean, that's the hard -- that's the hard thing, because I mean you're looking at, you know, for a huge percentage of our country, they don't have like, a dad with a gazillion bucks that's just going -- you know, even though they're like a mediocre student get to go to an Ivy -- you know what I mean?
R:  Right.
L:  They don't have that, you know, and the whole thing is like it's held up as, you know, I think for a lot of people it's held up just like, well this is the way that you can do this and you'll get money for school.  You can better yourself.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And like, I don't know, somewhere in like, a little baby [inaudible] it says somewhere, like, okay, you're -- you know, and we'll probably send you somewhere and, you know, and [LAUGH] I mean, you know, [inaudible] yeah, the whole -- it -- it's just real dumb[?], I mean, it's you know, and I know that, you know, we don't have a draft now but I don't -- I don't think this is any --
R:  Well do you think, you know, if a person was -- was -- was, like I say, in the reserves and if he didn't want to go but they make him go.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well then they drafted him then.  If he don't wanna go.
L:  Um, well yeah, that's why you have a reserve.  I mean it's part -- you know what I mean?  You know I -- I don't know, it just -- yeah.
R:  They made him do something he didn't want to do.
L:  Yeah.  You know, and that's -- and that's another thing too, it's because, I think that you know, that I do bel- -- and I believe that, you know, our country does not know the facts.  You know.
R:  I don't think they do either.  Because you know, when nine, one, one happened --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, they -- they let a whole lot of folks over here in this country.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you don't know -- you know, I don't know whether that man did or not.  He may have but wh- -- wh- -- wh- -- what's the American way?  Prov- -- innocent until proven guilty.
L:  Guilty.
R:  So you know, I don't know, and if he did it, then you know, yeah, he need to be punished, but if he didn't they need to try to find out who did.  I don't know.  I really don't know.
L:  It's just -- yeah.  Yeah and I think the whole -- yeah, I mean, like, you know, that goes by and that really [inaudible] I mean it's incredibly, you know, horrible, horrible thing that happened.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, and yeah, and um, and just horrible and horrible and horrible, but -- yeah, I don't think what we did in the Middle East had anything to do with that. [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't know.
L:  You know and -- and I [inaudible] I don't really know either and nobody knows.
R:  No.
L:  You know.  I think that, you know, for as much as this country has like, freedom of information, we don't get it.  And there's, um, I don't know um, like, in my job, I come into contact with a lot of people who are um, newly arrived immigrants, and like, you know, when you get to know them and stuff, the stories that they tell are just so horrible about what they went through
