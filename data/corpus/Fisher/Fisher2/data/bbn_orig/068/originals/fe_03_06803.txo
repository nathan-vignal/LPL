L:  [NOISE] Hullo.
R:  Hi.
L:  I- -- I'm Beverley. [NOISE] 
R:  I'm Anne. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Nice to talk to you, Beverley.
L:  [MN] [LAUGH] Nice to talk to you.
R:  [LAUGH] Um.  [LIPSMACK] Well, how do I feel --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- about strikes by professional athletes?  [LIPSMACK] Um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- personally, I feel that professional athletes get paid --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- way too much money.
L:  [NOISE] Oh I agree.
R:  For what they do. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh yes.  [NOISE]  Definitely. [NOISE] 
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um.  It seems like --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- at least in our society -- we seem to reward people who --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- can excel at sports, which --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- is a certain talent, but we don't seem to --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- reward people who [SIGH] can -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- excel in education or academics --
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  -- or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- medicine or --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- other things with -- the same way that we reward --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- people who excel in sports. 
L: [NOISE]
R:  I don't know why that is.
L:  [SIGH] No -- I find that it's giving our children such a terrible message.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know -- that they see all of this money being made by athletes.  And when you think about just what athletes are doing, you know, when you try to explain this to a child that -- y- know -- there are other important things in life --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they look at you, "But, y- know -- but you can't make this kind of money".
R:  Yeah.  That's true.
L:   [NOISE] Now, unfortunately, in our society, money seems to be thing that makes the difference.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Y- know -- in terms of people making choices in their lives and if you've got someone who's going to be that desperate for as much as they can get they're going to look at something like sports and think, "Well, this is the way to do it".
R:  [COUGH] Right.  [NOISE] I just saw a report --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I'm a high school teacher and I was talking, um, with some of my --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- students about [SIGH] um -- [LIPSMACK] there was a news --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- report the other day about a young high sch- -- I believe he's a high school -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- senior -- he has not even graduated yet -- who signed a contract with um --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- I think it was Nike --
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  -- uh, who me- -- who has ah --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- been promised ninety million dollars.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Ho.  Oh my goodness.
R:  [NOISE] And he's all of seventeen or something like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's just absurd.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  And some of the kids were saying --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  "-- "Well, why do -- why do you have, ah, such a problem with that?"  I said, "Well, what happens -- let's say just for example that --"
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  "-- he never actually -- er -- he gets an injury or something like that". 
L:  [NOISE] Right. 
R:  "He never plays a minute --"
L:  Exactly.
R:  "-- of professional basketball". 
L:  [NOISE] But he's got that contract.
R:  "Well, he's got that ninety million dollars". [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Oh goodness.
R:  But then again, I think well, if these people -- the companies -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- are willing to pay this exorbitant amount, I guess -- you know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it's a free country in some respects and who am I to say --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  "-- "Oh turn down ninety million --"
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  "-- dollars and -- you know -- go out and get a degree and work --"
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  "-- for the rest of your life --"
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  "-- and never --" [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh yes. [NOISE] 
R:  "-- never amass that kind of fortune"?
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  I mean, I don't think that's a realistic expectation to have of anyone.
L:  What's frightening to me more than anything else is suppose something physically happens to these athletes --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  -- then, what are they supposed to do?  Y- know, most of them --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- don't know about going out and getting trained for something other than playing these sports.
R:  Right.
L:  Y- know -- and here they're relying on being able to do all of these physical things which may not always be the case for them.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I was -- uh, one of my students was doing a paper on --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um -- should college athletes be --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- paid at all.  Right now they can't according to the --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the normal ah guidelines put for us but --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um -- this -- one of their statistics that they found was --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that the average career of a person --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I think in the NFL or the NBA --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- one -- either football or basketball -- was three years.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  And they're done.
L:  Yes.
R:  And usually at that time they've --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- either gotten injured so they cannot play --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- anymore or their -- their prime time of playing --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- is over, or --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they've amassed so much money that they can retire --
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] 
R:  -- when they're -- you know -- not even twenty five years old.
L:  Exactly.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Scary to think of a -- a twenty two year old looking at retirement. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK] Well, we continue to stress to kids --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know -- you need to do well in school and get --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- an education and pay for college and --
L:  [NOISE] Exactly.
R:  -- when -- when really --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] if you're one of the very, very few who's --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- extremely talented and happens to have --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- a good agent to represent you --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you don't have to do that at all.
L:  That's right. [NOISE] 
R:  So -- I don't know.  
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  It's kind of bizarre.
L:  [NOISE] It is.  But then, [NOISE] y- -- when you think [NOISE] about just what our society is telling people --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know -- these are what th- the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- important things in life, you know.  Making all of this money in sports --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or for that matter in -- y- know in the movies --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- -n television.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I mean the money involved there is so much more than what we would get in regular jobs.
R:  Mhm.  [NOISE]  [LIPSMACK] I know.  I dunno know -- I dunno know why our society [NOISE] places such a --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- big value on [NOISE] things to entertain us.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  But --
L:  [SIGH] [MN] 
R:  -- then again, I think about how much, you know, people normally --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- pay wh- -- if they go to a sporting event or if they go to the --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- movies and I mean -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- really, for the [NOISE] am- [COUGH] -- the amount --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- of entertainment that you see, [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I mean, people pay --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I don't know in -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- in my part of the country, in Michigan, they pay around --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- eight to ten dollars a ticket for a movie and for a sporting event, depending on if it's a [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- college team or a --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- pro team, you can pay -- y- know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- into the hundreds of dollars and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they don't seem to bat an eye. [NOISE]   
L:  Not at all.
R:  They've got lots of people going -- [LAUGH]
L:  Oh sure. [LAUGH] Those tickets definitely sell out.
R:  Yeah.  Y-
L:  But that's one of the reasons why they can get these salaries.
R:  Yeah.  Yep.
L:  They knew that this money will come pouring in.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  As far as the strikes for professional athletes, I suppose if --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- ah -- personally, if they go on strike, I guess that's their [NOISE] prerogative.  I don't think they should be made to play but then again, usually when professional athletes go on strike their [NOISE] particular team or their sport suffers --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- because they realize that [NOISE] people can find other things [NOISE] to do with their time besides going to watch them.  So, they're sort of shooting themselves --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- in the foot.
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] I look at it like they sound like a bunch of spoiled babies.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They have all of this money; more money than they know what to do with --
R:  M yeah. [NOISE] 
L:   "-- and they're crying about, "Oh well, we're not getting this --"
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  "-- we're not getting that".
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, it's sad.  It really is sad.
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  And sure they have a right in their mind that -- y- know, "Oh yeah, we can strike to get whatever we want" but, I mean really, this is not an important issue.
R:  Nope.  I agree. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  An' I [LAUGH] I don't know how to -- [LIPSMACK] I dunno if there's a way to change that.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I think it's a lot --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it's a lot deeper than --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- just the sports teams I think, as --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you talked about it.  It has to do with the values --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that we're imparting on -- [SIGH] on children -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that our society places on things like --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- sports and --
L:  [NOISE] [MN] 
R:  -- movies and stuff like that.
L:  That's where the change is going to have to occur.
R:  Yeah.
L:  At some point --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- society is going to have to shift and realize what's more important --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and start putting its priorities in line.  But that may not happen in our life time.
R:  No.  And probably -- I dunno -- because the United States, you know, in comparison to -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- many other countries, is so --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [MN] so wealthy and so well off and we're so -- as --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- a society we're so spoiled into thinking --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that this is -- you know -- the way that people should live.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  They should be able to [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- become whatever they want to become and -en -- as -- amass as big of a fortune --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- as they can possibly amass and usually we --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- have no idea that [LIPSMACK] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the rest of the world really doesn't live like this.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  That they're [LAUGH] usually are much more hand to mouth --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- than we are.  I don't -- I dunno if --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- if our society continues to be so well off, if that really will ever change.
L:  [NOISE] That's a good question.
R:  So we just -- sort of greed begets greed I think.
L:  It's true.  And then, when you look at the behaviour of some of these athletes, you know they're feeling, because they have all of this money, they're entitled to do whatever they want to do.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Me -- I'm tired of seeing these stories in the news about these athletes who just go out there and crack up their [NOISE] cars and hurt people --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and just do whatever. [NOISE]  
R:  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  You know?  And they feel like, "Well, that's all right.  I'm rich".  [NOISE] 
R:  Yuh.
L:  "I can pay for it".
R:  Yuh.  And they can usually buy their way out or, buy a [NOISE] super defence lawyer and [NOISE] talk their way out of it.
L:  Oh, sure.
R:  Yep.  Everything ultimately has some price I guess.
L:  Why, I guess when you have that kind of salary you can make it your business to excuse just about anything.
R:  Yeah.  [LIPSMACK] I think so too.
L:  I just worry about whatever children are seeing here.
R:  Hm?
L:  And I just try to make it clear to my students -- I have eighth graders y- know --
R:  Oh, do you?
L:  Yup.  It's scary for them --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- y- know.  Th- this is the way they want to live their lives and I'm telling them this is maybe less than one percent of the population --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- y- know, so please don't expect that that's all you're gonna get a chance to do in life.
R:  Yeah.  Where do you teach school at?
L:  Oh, in New York City -- in Manhattan.
R:  New York City.  Wow.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [MN] Well, I teach in Michigan.  I have ninth and tenth graders this year.
L:  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK] Well, [MN] I'm sure they can be quite a handful.
R:  Oh -- well, yeah.  I'm -- but you're used to that with eighth graders. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, yes.  [LAUGH]  Oh.  An- -- and I've known this particular group ever since they were in grade five.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  So this has been interesting, watching them grow through all of these things.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Now, it helps that they can talk about just about everything.
R:  Uh-huh.  Now, is the school that you teach at a multicultural school? [NOISE] 
L:  Yes.  Yes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But that makes a tremendous difference.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN]
R:  I was gonna -- I was gonna --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- ask you -- um -- the school that I teach at is --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- predominantly [SIGH] white -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- middle class [SIGH] and um, the kids --
