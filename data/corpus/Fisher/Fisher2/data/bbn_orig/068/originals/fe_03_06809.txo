R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Hi.  This is Susan.
L:  Hi.  This is Jamie.
R:  Oh, hi.
L:  [COUGH] How're you doing? [COUGH] 
R:  So what -- do you care about the professional athletes?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, I am --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- definitely a Mets fan and I'm definitely a -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- Redskins fan.
R:  Are you really?
L:  [COUGH] Absolutely.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Absolutely.
R:  So, do you think they ought to get th- -- get the money they're getting?  [SIGH] [NOISE] 
L:  Um. [SIGH] 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That's a good question.  [SIGH] The --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- only thing I can think of is if somebody -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- really trained for a job over a long -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- period of time, such as twenty -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- years they put into it --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they vest their money, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- over that period of time.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  But these guys -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- have a high burn out factor and a high injury --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- factor.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  So that, if they're hurt --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they're done.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They're -- they're not viable to the team any more so that money is -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- in theory supposed to carry them over for the next, you know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- working periods.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. [SIGH] 
L:  I mean, the endorsements recently that the teenagers -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- are getting for -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Nike shoes, if you've seen --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  --'em, like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- thirteen million dollars or --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- something at --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- fifteen years old --
R:  [MN] No. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  That one [LAUGH] is really starting to blow me away.  There's actually been two of them recently --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- signed up like that.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  A fifteen year old and a thirteen year old --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Wow.
L:  -- for thirteen million dollars to do shoes.  [SIGH] That, I think's, a little -- [SIGH] little far fetched.  
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] 
L:  'Cause what's -- what's a fifteen year old gonna do with thirteen million dollars? [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I don't know if they [NOISE] can actually get their hands on it at that age.
L:  'Til they're twenty one or something.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  But then, their parents can get their hands on that.  [LAUGH] [SIGH] So, oh well then they have be put into a life style, you know so there's the executor with[?] the state or something.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  So, yeah.  That money will be tapped prior to them --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- being twenty one.  I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if -- I don't know how old you are but a long time ago there was something called the Jackie Coogan Law that was passed out on the West Coast, to protect child actors and actresses from the parents or other [SIGH] ah, people dipping their fingers into the -- the person's assets --
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  -- the children's assets.
R:  Yeah.  No, I'm forty eight --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- but I -- [MN] I haven't paid that much attention to the financial affairs out there. [LAUGH]
L:  Well no, no -- what I'm saying is if you'd --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- looked at -- I'm close to fifty but if you looked at like um, Our Gang --
R:  Uh huh.
L:  -- they -- they virtually walked off with nothing.
R:  Oh.
L:  They were just paid like, so much for the deal and at that point the parents had access to that money.  Even though they were supposed to be put in trusts --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
L:  -- the parents could touch that money and so by the time say, Alfalfa -- God rest his soul, he's dead -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but in theory if he had lived, um, there was no money in his pot.
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  That actually happened to Spanky --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- who -- who's now a, um [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] a, [SIGH] a vacuum cleaner sales person in -- in mid Jersey.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, so these kids that you're talking about today, are they professional athletes?
L:  [NOISE] They've done something.  Yeah, they've done -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- something to make them notable --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- whether it's been golf or um --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- basketball --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- or something.  They've -- they've been notable.  [SIGH] But for -- -or [LAUGH] thirteen or fifteen I st- --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- I still think -- and they've got great agents who's getting a great ten percent out of [LAUGH] that it's fine.
R:  Well, [NOISE] Rush Limbaugh thinks that they deserve whatever people are willing to pay.
L:  That's true. 
R:  And I --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- you know, I don't know.  I mean that [MN] -- I don't know where that money's coming from [LAUGH] and --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- what, you know, what they're going to do with it, but um --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- I don't know, because I don't know if I could get on TV and do endorsements.  And I don't know if I could get on the field and -- and run with a football and 
L:  I would do an endorsement if I sincerely believed in it.  If I do not believe in the endorsement I would not.  Oh, if I was in dire straits --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  -- push it.
R:  I mean, I would do it.  I just don't know if I have the talent to do it.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh Lord --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- they pick any John Doe off the street.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] 
R:  [SIGH] And -- and I know I can't run [MN] fifty yards with a football and -- and avoid a bunch of men coming at me so 
L:  Uh, hey, I'd run [LAUGH] with a football fifty yards and no ball[?] -- bunch of men would run after me. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I couldn't do it.
L:  [SIGH] Like, "Yo, here I am". [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I couldn't do it. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Like, yell, "Come, come". [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] And it was fifty years old, half of them wouldn't make it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- past the fifty yard mark. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well I mean, that's what I mean.  So, in a way I think --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- they'd -- they probably deserve --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- some pay but [SIGH] --
L:  I believe they deserve the money. [SIGH] 
R:  -- I don- -- I don't know that they [MN] ought to be striking [SIGH] if -- 
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- if they're not getting what they want --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because --
L:  I -- I think the striking --
R:  I think if they strike --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- then, so- -- they oughta -- it oughta be allowed that the --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- team managers can get other players to play. [NOISE] 
L:  You mean like scab players?
R:  Y-, well, whatever.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know what they're called but they ought to be able to get some and -- [NOISE] and keep the game going for the season --
L:  [SIGH] Actu- --
R:  -- because look what it does to the season.
L:  [SIGH] Well, it ruins the season.  It ruins the tickets.  It'll -- actually will affect the tickets for the next year.  It takes -- for me who -- who -- who have had children, it takes the spirit of the game out.  Because when you start putting the dollar signs in, it's like, "I won't play unless I get x amount of dollars and if I don't get x amount of dollars, then I'm going to strike". 
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
L:  And the children are there with their baseball mitts and their gloves and they're out to see their little hero.  You know what I mean?  The hero of the hour --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and they can't see them because they're on strike.  I actually [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] like to go to the grass roots baseball games.  [MN] Th- -- not the ones of like -- I live in Philadelphia -- not the Phillies.
R:  Uh huh.
L:  But over in Camden which is just, like, over the bridge in Jersey --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they have the Camden Riversharks.  Natural grass, second string players. [SIGH] It is a real fun experience.  The tickets [LAUGH] are very reasonable. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they have, like, their own little mascot.  A rivershark comes out and does his little dance, you know.  And they're shooting things into the [MN] -- you know, into the crowd for the kids, and [MN] -- like one Saturday's, like, bobble doll Saturday and all the kids get a bobble doll.  You know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.
L:  It makes -- it makes it a lot more fun and enjoyable.  And that's half the deal.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  When you go to those games --
R:  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  -- it's half the deal.  I've been to the professional games and you see [LAUGH] guys out there with the -- the sports sheets and they're like marking things off and I mean, these guys are like addicted. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It's kinda like a little scary.  You know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.  Now, I'm from Kansas City and [NOISE] in our -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- stadium there --
L:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] 
R:  -- uh for a while they had the astro turf --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and guys were getting hurt really --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- bad on that so they --
L:  Oh yeah.  They do out here too.
R:  -- they took it out and now they have natural grass in the ground.
L:  They have astro turf in the Vet here and it -- it's -- 
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- they've had problems.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They've had some major problems with it.
R:  Because the ground is so hard it breaks bones and stuff --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  -- I guess is the deal. 
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  And it's slick too I would think but, uh --
L:  Yeah, well see, with the dirt field -- I mean --
R:  -- and th- -- and there's [inaudible] --
L:  -- you can -- there's grooves and -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- nooks and things in the dirt itself.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Actually can be a positive force instead of that slippery stuff.
R:  Yeah.  You get some traction and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think for that risk they -- they probably deserve a -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a little more than somebody that's typing --
L:  [SIGH] That's my point.
R:  -- or 
L:  Once they've broken a bone  I mean, I remember watching the Redskins and Joe Theismann popping out his leg and that was just the end of his career.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And so, what I'm saying is -- is if they're paying them -- for hypothetical reasons here -- [SIGH] if they're paying them twenty million dollars a season, which I know is like totally exaggerated -- um, the point is, that money may have to carry them over the next twenty, thirty, forty years, depending on how young they are.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.  Well, I just -- I -ways -- wish we could go on strike.
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  We're self employed here and yeah, we don't get to go on strike --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- or anything. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- that's -- unfortunately [LAUGH] that's one of the problems.
R:  So, I think a lot of people that -- that are against that may have a little -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- little bit of that sour grapes thing, which I do. [LAUGH] So 
L:  Well, it- it's like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you have to [MN] choose; like my son.  He just had an injury in his job.  He went for air conditioning and heating training and he took a job --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that was paying excellent money but absolutely no benefits.  And we grew up in a family that was pro Union, pro benefits, even if you took a little less an hour --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because it covered you totally.
R:  Yeah.
L:  He -- he became totally injured right now due to a -- due to a freak accident.  Um, he has no insurance.  I mean, we- -- we're scrambling around to get him some insurance.  The guy is saying, "It's not workers comp related" and technically it -- it happened as a progression of his job but when it actually happened he was like home.  You know what I mean?  His back gave out --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- his -- he blew some discs but they --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- definitely see a cause and effect.
R:  Now, do the athletes have ah insurance?
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  I don't know that much about it -- 
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  -- so if they get ah --
L:  [SIGH] Oh yeah.  They're covered.
R:  -- get injured, are they covered?
L:  They have -- they have their own doctors on the field.  They have their own sports medicine place they can be recouped.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh yeah.  Th- -- they --
R:  But if they get totally --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- disabled ah, permanently, then [MN] are they covered?
L:  Um, when their contract runs out I'd -- I wouldn't think so.  I -- I -- you know -- but then again, it's all about whatever the agents design in their contract.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  If their agents design in their contract that -- that they'll have health care for ten years after the deal if something should happen, then they have it.  If not then [SIGH] I guess they're to use their twenty million dollars -- we're just using a figure here -- [SIGH] twenty million dollars to, um [LIPSMACK] live on and buy their own insurance.  Because most insurance companies, with preexisting conditions, make you wait a year.
R:  Yes.  I used to work for one.  I know. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  They make you wait a [MN] -- [LAUGH] make you wait a year.
R:  I used to quote group plans and s- -- and we [SIGH] -- if we ever got a request [NOISE] to quote on a -- on a professional sport --
