L:  Hello, my --
R:  Hi! [LAUGH]
L:  Hi!
R:  I'm Marcie.
L:  I'm Joan.
R:  Hi, Joan!
L:  How are you?
R:  I'm good.  How about you?
L:  Oh, fine.
R:  Good.  Well, what do you think about airport security?
L:  Er, I think it's very important and I like to think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that, yes it has e- -- lessened, ah, terrorism.  What do you think?
R:  I totally agree with you.  [SIGH] I am a person that does not like to fly.  That probably has flown more than most [LAUGH] people.  [SIGH] Er, I -- I just ah, ah, have never liked it.  It -- it just, em, -- you know, I guess I've always been frightened.  I'm a real white knuckle flyer, um, but I think a lot of that was caused by the fact that I did not feel that the airlines were as secure as I would have liked --
L:  [NOISE].
R:  -- and, I frankly feel better about flying now than I ever have before.
L:  That's fascinating.  That your intuition told you --
R:  [NOISE].
L:  -- it wasn't safe.
R:  Yeah!  You know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I -- I just I -- I knew that it couldn't possibly be and I -- of course, up until, er, nine eleven there really had not been a horrible incident but I -- I had a very, I think, a frightening experience happen on one of our trips back from Hawaii, and it really made me very nervous because I realized then how insecure I was and how the rest of the pan- -- how insecure the rest of the passengers were.  And, um, I think now that that incident wouldn't be tolerated and it wouldn't happen.
L:  How fascinating!  What happened?
R:  [SIGH] Well, we got on a -- ah, we missed our flight in California and had to take another flight on into -- I was living in Houston at that time and, it was, er, it was a late flight and when -- when we got on the flight there was, like, six roughnecks that were on the flight with us, and obviously they had been partying and drinking to a tremendous extent.  And when we became airborne they became extremely loud and verbally very abusive.  They, um, v- -- insulted, you know, they -- they did some terrible things to an elderly lady who had taken her -- her granddaughter to the restroom and I -- I was just shocked!  And, then one of them was behind my chair and kept kicking the back of my chair and, er, nothing was -- nothing was said, nothing was done.  I mean, this was -- this was allowed to continue clear from Los Angeles on into Houston, and --
L:  [MN].
R:  -- I just don't think that would happen today.
L:  That's wonderful!  The -- the stewards --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and the stewardess just let it go?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  It -- th- -- anarchy!  Well, now I understand how you would feel more comfortable.  [SIGH] I'm -- I'm glad that -- that they're allowed to carry guns.  Isn't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that new?  Er, that, er, -- I always was a little concerned with the hijacking.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We've had hijacking problems for how many years?  Twenty years?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  No, I -- I totally agree.  A long, long time ago, a friend of mine was married to a guy that worked for the FBI and he went on an -- as sky marshal way back then, um, and he said that nobody ever knew if there was going to be a sky marshal on or not.  Well then, for some reason or another that program kind of went by the by.
L:  Right, [MN] I --
R:  And, maybe they didn't feel it was necessary or, I don't know --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- but I think we all know now, it was [LAUGH].
L:  Yes.  Because a- -- and, you know, we were really late in even deciding to do this.
R:  Yes.
L:  Because it, -- I mean, remember that accident in the airplane and -- and there was room over New York?  And, they thought maybe it was a missile that was shot --
R:  Yeah!
L:  -- into the air?  I mean, we have really been lax far too long.
R:  Well, I totally agree.  I totally agree.  And this last flight --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that I took, I was, I guess, one of the random, er, few --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that was pulled aside and I had to take off my boots and I had to sit in a chair and they g- -- you -- you know, kind of went over me with a wand, and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, you know, look- -- looked at my case and that sort of thing and, you know, I was not offended at all.  I thought, "You know, good for them!"  I -- I don't mind having to get to the airport earlier.  I don't mind that inconvenience because I think it makes everyone that steps on that plane that much safer. 
L:  I agree.  I really agree.  Ah, it is terrifying --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I've been concerned with the types of people in airports.
R:  Yes.
L:  There has been -- I mean, that has -- the quality has diminished --
R:  -- Oh!
L:  -- tremendously in the last twenty, thirty years.  It is frightening in the airports themselves.
R:  Oh, absolutely!
L:  I -- I remember feeling that way about bus stations.
R:  Yes, exactly!
L:  Now -- now, it's airports.
R:  Yes!
L:  You know, so, good heavens --
R:  [MN].
L:  -- and -- and so the more security, the better, 'cause it just -- th- -- there's just so much p- people.  I think, probably it's the population increase issue.
R:  [SIGH] Well, yeah.  I think it has and -- and, I'm a firm believer -- ah, I guess maybe it was the way I was brought up or something, but there have also been studies done on the fact that [SIGH] you can have the same group of people to a dressy cocktail party, and they're dressed up and -- and they're very, you know, ah, social and they're very polite and they're very well mannered, and turn around and have that same group of people to a masquerade party and everything changes.  I mean, it becomes much more raucous and much more, um, you know, th- -- everything kind of is -- might, you know, maybe nothing bad happens but it's just more raucous, much m- -- many more things are tolerated.  And I feel with the dress of people, um, in everyday life, when you see these people that, er, are walking through the airport in muscle shirts and -- and, er, jeans with big holes in them and flip flops, and pony tails and that's -- that's women -- men and women, girls and boys.  I think that -- that behavior deteriorates.
L:  So, the way you dress, er, [SIGH] um, increases or decreases the way you behave, or ? [MN]
R:  I believe that, yes.
L:  Oh, my goodness --
R:  I absolutely believe that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I mean, I don't think that you have to necessarily have on, you know, designer, expensive clothing.  But I think that, when you are content to wear jeans that, er, are -- that look dirty.  They're not!  They're extremely expensive.  I saw some at Abercrombie and Fitch the other day and I about died, 'cause they were brand new and, I mean, they looked so filthy I would not have been caught dead in them, anywhere!  And, yet they were, er, you know, ninety five dollar jeans.  But I think when you put those on and you're willing to walk around with your underwear showing, and, you know, looking unkempt, I think your behavior deteriorates.  I really do!
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I -- I agree.  I agree.  It's just -- not many pretty people in the airports.
R:  No!
L:  No, not a- --
R:  No, and some of them are downright scary!
L:  They are frightening.  So, bring on the police!  Help us!
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, you know, I don't think that, er, it would hurt [NOISE].  Well, 'cause I -- I have long been a proponent of uniforms in schools.  Um, I had to wear a uniform the whole time I was in school and, no, I didn't like it.  I -- I -- you know, I had, er, -- I felt the special flair for dressing and, I felt most put upon that I had to wear a uniform.  But, we certainly didn't have, [MN] you know, the incidents that -- that they're having now, er, -- certain things were demanded of us, and other things were simply not tolerated, and I don't think that it would hurt for airports to post rules and say, pr- -- there is a proper dress code here.
L:  That --
R:  And --
L:  -- would be interesting --
R:  Yeah 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, yeah. 
R:  I -- I, you know 
L:  And, if they did, er, would s- -- would security, ah, be -- be l- -- would be better?  Would -- would that be the first step to change society?  More people would become more responsible.  'Cause they know th- there would be one place they'd have to dress up?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah!
L:  You don't have to dress up for church.  You don't have to --
R:  No!
L:  -- dress up for work.
R:  -- That's exactly.
L:  But if you have to go dress up -- up at the airport?
R:  Yeah, you know, I -- I think that -- I think it would -- might make a difference, and I think --
L:  [SIGH].
R:  Now, I'm not saying that simply dress is the answer to all the problems.  But I'm saying that if the airports said, "Look, you know, we're tired --"
L:  [NOISE].
R:  "-- of the inside of our airports looking like", you know, well, I guess they couldn't say the Greyhound bus depot, but I mean, truly, that's what its become.  And, I think that if people felt like, "Gosh, I'm not gonna take a chance on showing up at the airport with ripped, torn, blue jeans and my underwear showing and a hole in my shirt and flip flops, because they're not gonna let me on my plane.  I'm gonna miss my plane".
L:  But Marcie, here we go into the -- the first amendment.  You- -- your --
R:  Yeah? [NOISE] 
L:  -- freedom.  Here we go.  And I think that's probably why some people would not like all this security in the airport.  They think that's a threat to their personal freedom, and their individuality, and, er, th- -- that -- that's pretty Nazi like, when you get into --
R:  Well, in the --
L:  -- the dress code.
R:  -- I think that in some ways that it is, but I think in some ways that it's -- [SIGH]  there's nothing wrong with a little respect, um, you know, you and I certainly deserve to feel as secure and protected as -- as they deserve to feel.  They can dress any way they want.  I think that just a -- just a decent medium is all I'm suggesting. 
L:  [SIGH] W- well then who decid- -- I mean, I too came from an -- I had -- I wore a uniform, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, I -- so I grew up with a uniform attitude and, it was easy an- an- -- in- a -- I don't -- I didn't mind it actually.  But, who is to determine what looks nice and what doesn't?
R:  Well, I think
