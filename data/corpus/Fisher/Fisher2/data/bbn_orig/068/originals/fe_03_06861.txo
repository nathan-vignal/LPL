R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hi.  I'm Jeannie --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in Texas.
R:  Hi.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  My name is Millie.  And I'm in Rochester, New York.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, I'm kind of new at this, so I hope I do it right.  I don't know --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- what I'm supposed to do [LAUGH].
R:  Well, we just talk --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- about the subject, I guess.
L:  Well, what -- I don't know about --
R:  This is my -- this is my third --
L:  Ahah -- ahah.
R:  -- night, so, er -- I guess this will be my last one [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, okay. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Well, mainly what I -- oh, are you still there?
R:  Yes, I am.
L:  Oh, I heard a clicking sound.
R:  No -- no, I'm here.
L:  Oh, ah.  Well, I don't know about you but I've mainly -- the last trip I made, er, was a year ago and I thought, "This is just too much trouble".  
R:  Oh.
L:  And it's gotten worse since then [NOISE].  I understand why they have to do it, and I think it's a good idea and I guess -- I'm sure it stops some trouble, but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's just -- I'm fifty nine and it's just too much hassle for me.
R:  [SIGH] Well, I -- I don't know --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I -- I haven't --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- traveled lately this year either.  It's been about a year --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but, er, [LIPSMACK] I think it's a good idea --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- and, er, I try and, you know, we usually try --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and plan our trips at an hour of day where it's not gonna be too -- too busy.
L:  Yeah.  Me too.  I always --
R:  But --
L:  -- try to take the Red Eye, or something.
R:  Well, yeah.  
L:  To get -- to get [MN] --
R:  Well, I don't like that one either, but ... [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I was always going after the cheapest one [LAUGH].  And --
R:  Yeah.  That's true too.
L:  And, used to -- I was trying to find a -- a plane that might not be stuffed full, but I don't think they fly those any more [LAUGH].
R:  Well, [LAUGH] I know they're cutting way back, and, er --
L:  Today's the last flight for the Concorde.
R:  Oh, well.
L:  In the US.  They said it's just too expensive.  They can't run it any more. 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah. 
L:  But --
R:  That was an expensive trip [LAUGH].
L:  But in any way, the security, you know, taking off your shoes and, you know --
R:  I know.  I know.
L:  -- all the lines and -- and just, you know, personally just having military people standing around made me feel angst.
R:  Right.
L:  I know that they're supposed to make you feel good [LAUGH], but it didn't.  It made me feel like --
R:  Well --
L:  -- I was at war, or something [LAUGH].
R:  -- well, the thing is, you know, you hear about --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- there was one instance where somebody got on the plane with a plastic gun --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- or something, and --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- they didn't even catch it, so ...
L:  I know.
R:  But, anyway, they, er, --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I think it's a good idea.  I feel more secure, knowing that, er, you know, they're -- they're investigating --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and searching people.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, er, like you say, it -- it does -- it does seem --
L:  [NOISE] [MN]
R:  -- like big brother, you know [LAUGH] watching over us.
L:  [MN] I know.  And then you watch something like Twenty Twenty, and some reporter goes all through the airport.  I don't know which show it was, but, you know, nobody stops him for [LAUGH] anything.
R:  I know -- I know.
L:  And you think, "What happened to all these people that are watching the airport?"
R:  Well, they must have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- been on breaks [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  And then, I think it has helped us.  I've now flown since this happened, but now they have some better standards, I think, for the people that are guarding and they're paying them a little bit better salary.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause a lot of times they just had a warm body standing there.
R:  Right.  Well I think they're -- they're also cutting --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- a lot of these people who used to do a lot of traveling for their companies.  They're cutting back and not sending them.
L:  Yeah.  I know --
R:  You know, it's --
L:  -- mine -- my --
R:  -- it's [MN] quite expens- -- you know, it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- too expensive and they feel they can do it over a -- the telephone, I guess. 
L:  Well, and plus, you know, I'm retired --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- but I have to say, I took advantage of [LAUGH] going to a lot of places where I really wanted to go and ...
R:  Ahah.
L:  They certainly didn't need to send us, but they did so you may as well take advantage [LAUGH] of it.
R:  Well, I guess if it's some place you -- you wanna see, it's -- it's a good opportunity.
L:  Well, let's put it this way.  You rarely see a business meeting in, er -- er, some obscure place [LAUGH].
R:  Well, yeah, I suppose.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I didn't work.  I, er, was -- -- a home --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- caretaker --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, er --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- my husband is retired now, and --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- I'm sixty five, so --
L:  Well -- 
R:  -- it --
L:  -- welcome to retirement.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm fifty nine and I'm retired [LAUGH].
R:  Well, that's good.
L:  And I love it.
R:  My sist- --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  My sister retired when she was sixty.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Six -- [LIPSMACK] I think it was sixty.
L:  [MN]
R:  And, er, she loves it.  She is just having the time of her life, but she's doing a lot more traveling too.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You see, last -- the last trip that I was going to make  -- I go to Canada usually, every summer.
R:  Ahah.
L:  Although I'm not this summer.  And, get a la- -- a cottage at the lake and last year I drove because I didn't want to deal with --
R:  Well, this is it.
L:  Well, for two reasons actually.  I wanted to take the dog, and -- and, you k- -- and I would not make her fly.  She's too old.
R:  Ahah.
L:  But, um   But, plus, I -- I just didn't wanna deal with all the hassles, I thought.
R:  I know.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I know.  A lot of people are doing the same thing.  Driving.
L:  [MN]
R:  I know.  We go down to Florida --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- in the winter, and we've been driving.
L:  Ahah.
R:  And it's nice.  We, er, we get to visit people --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- along the way that we know, and, you know, it's --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- so nice that we're retired.  We can take these leisurely drives.
L:  Yeah.  And you know what?  For -- this was the first time I actually felt like it was a pleasant trip getting there.  And coming back --
R:  Good!
L:  -- home.
R:  Good.
L:  It wasn't like, you know.  I just dread -- I always have dreaded the [LAUGH] airports because it's just always pushy and rushy, it seems like.
R:  Y- -- yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  Well, Rochester airport is a comparatively small airport.
L:  [MN] Ahah.
R:  So, er, it -- it's not really that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- busy when --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know, if you go in off times.
L:  [SIGH] I get New York screwed up.  I mean, I get, er, confused but I used to fly into Buffalo instead of Canada.
R:  Well, Buffalo is one hour west of us. 
L:  Yeah.  That's what I thought.  I thought it was close.
R:  Right near the border of Canada.
L:  Yeah.  And it was much easier to fly in there --
R:  Right.
L:  -- than to -- and cheaper --
R:  Yes --
L:  -- actually.
R:  -- yes.
L:  And it was about the same drive for me 'cause I used to have to rent a car in Toronto.
R:  Ahah.
L:  And it was a -- actually closer to go to Buffalo.
R:  Yeah -- yeah.  Even here --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the -- the fares -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- are cheaper out of Buffalo than Rochester.  
L:  [MN]
R:  Rochester, we're fighting tooth and nail --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- to get some economical airlines in.
L:  Ahah.
R:  But, we do have a couple, but, er, they don't always go where you want to go.
L:  [MN] Well, I think, er --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't know, I think that maybe if they -- maybe they should publish things and make it more -- publish things to let people know exactly what to expect when they get to the airport.  You know --
R:  Well --
L:  -- give it to you with your ticket [LAUGH].
R:  -- th- -- that's a good i- -- well, now they don't give --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- tickets any more.
L:  Oh, that's true [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So that you could, er, not have your shoes on -- I mean, not wear lace up boots, or something. [NOISE]
R:  Right -- right. 
L:  All the inconveniences, and -- and I --
R:  And now they're saying that, er, your luggage.  They're only allowing a certain amount of weight per person.
L:  Ahah.  No more stuffing it all in the c- -- in the --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- checked luggage [LAUGH] like I used to do.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We did the same thing, but, er, it -- it really was hard to drag all that stuff around, you know, with --
L:  And then, er, the last time I flew.  Actually, I think that was probably the thing that -- well, the c- -- straw that broke the camel's back is they said  -- I needed to change something.  I can't even remember.  That was a year ago.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I got to the airport and I don't remember what we had to change but she -- the lady was real nice but she said if I had not charged it on my American Express and charged it early, like a month before the trip?
R:  Yeah.
L:  They wouldn't have changed it.
R:  Ooh.
L:  And it was something to do with security.  
R:  Ah.
L:  And she was telling me that, like, as a reminder, you know, to --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- if you pay cash, you look suspicious.  If you, er, --
R:  Well, I --
L:  -- do things at the last minute you look -- you increase your chances for being, [NOISE] you know, stopped.
R:  Isn't that s- -- oh, so, they check when you made your --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- reservations, probably.
L:  [MN] Well, I guess when I asked for change --
R:  Yeah, ye- --
L:  -- I think I got there early and asked to take an earlier flight.
R:  Ahah.
L:  And then this Christmas, my nephew and his -- my niece and her husband were coming back, and he's Canadian, and they were coming back at Christmas.  Well, his family, his parents, work in Saudi and so he [NOISE] goes over there --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a lot --
R:  Oh, my --
L:  -- about --
R:  -- goodn- --
L:  -- twice a year.
R:  Oh, dear.
L:  And, do you know, he got to the airport and he -- my niece and the baby.  They had a two month old baby [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, dear!
L:  And they wouldn't let him on the plane.
R:  Ah.
L:  Because there was some rule -- tiny glitch with his passport.
R:  [MN]
L:  And it was something that had never been a problem before, but technically it was wrong.  I mean, he really --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- did need to do something.
R:  They didn't just let him go through --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  like they usually did.
L:  No, and they -- they told us later that it was because the Saudi -- his passport was so stamped up with --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Saudi Arabia --
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  -- for all those years [LAUGH].
R:  So, now he got it straightened out?
L:  Yeah.  He had to stay three more days [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, dear.  Oh!
L:  And, [LAUGH] thankfully, his brother had -- or, his sister had brought him to the airport so he went back with her and she -- he wore her husband's clothes.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause all his stuff was all checked and on board.
R:  Sure.  So his wife and baby went ahead?
L:  Mhm.  My niece and two month old --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- baby, alone.
R:  Oh, dear.
L:  And, er --
R:  Well.
L:  So they're just checking.  It's just not a pleasant thing, anymore.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.  And, today they're talking about, you know, they were polling people about whether you'd be willing to pay for food on a plane, and I was like, "Well, if you wanna eat, yeah I guess you would be" [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know?  It just doesn't seem like a big deal to me [LAUGH].
R:  Well, you could always pack your own little lunch, I suppose.
L:  And, [MN] well, truthful, I was gonna say.  The last few times I've been on a plane, most everybody either b- bought their food in the airport, because, if they do serve you something it's not edible [LAUGH].
R:  It's just peanuts, or, er, [LAUGH].  I know -- I know.
L:  So 
R:  Well, I haven't really gone that far --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- where we had meals served to us.
L:  [MN] 
R:  So ...
L:  Well, not nice meals, at least [LAUGH].
R:  Right -- right.  It's been a f- -- a couple of years --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a few years, I think, in nin- -- no, it was in the year two thousand we went to California. 
L:  Ahah.
R:  So that was the last big trip we've taken.
L:  And, see the -- the best thing they gave you then probably in -- in, em, you know, not if you went first class.  Probably, a tuna fish sandwich [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [COUGH]
