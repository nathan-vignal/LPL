L:  Hi, I'm Rebecca.
R:  I'm Dennis.
L:  It's good to talk to you.
R:  How are you today?
L:  I'm good.  A little heavy topic. [LAUGH]
R:  [COUGH] Yeah. 
L:  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- honestly it's one I don't feel that qualified to make judgments about but --
R:  I don't either.
L:  -- I'll -- I'll do my best [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] let's see, I don't remember all the questions that they asked.  I know -- I know one of them was i- if we think that peace will ever be attained in the Middle East and I think -- I would say if it is it's going to be a long time.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Um, there are just -- there are just too many people who feel too strongly about their own position and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- consider the other position complete enemies that it just -- it looks like it would be such a long time before any peace could be -- could -- could ever happen there.
R:  Yeah, I don't see it happening in my lifetime. [NOISE]
L:  Right, it -- it's sad but I think it's true.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, as far as US involvement I don't really know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'm kinda torn about that.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  On one hand I feel like we're needed to be involved, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- on the other hand, it's an awful thing to be in the middle of.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  So, I don't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't really know. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] I don't know -- I don't know I think it's -- in a way --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I don't even know if we're actually doing any good our being over there [NOISE].
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, it -- like you were saying, the -- they grew -- they've grown up with that person as an enemies, there ain't nothing we're gonna do to change their minds thinking one person's an enemy compared to another person's not and it's the way they were raised and the way they're gonna live and there's nothing we'll ever do to change it.
L:  Right.  The only thing I can think of that we can do is, uh, basically to twist their arm and say, "Be nice". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah [LAUGH] and that's --
L:  Which is kind -- which has kind of been our role over there really.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, but I can't really see that being that effective.
R:  No, I don't think it's --
L:  Um --
R:  -- I don't know, there for a while they were happy we were over there and now it seems like they're trying to take pot shots at us again and [NOISE], uh, they're not happy for us being there anymore.
L:  Yeah, well I can kind of understand --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but on the other hand, you know, it's -- it's like they're a brand new country being born --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- you know, and, uh, frankly they -- frankly, I just can't -- I can't picture liberating them and then leaving them there to fend for themselves --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to start out with anyway.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Um, I don't know [LAUGH], like I said, it's a -- it's a hard topic for me --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to talk about because I don't feel that qualified.
R:  Yeah [NOISE].
L:  Um --
R:  And I'll be honest, I don't keep up on it [NOISE].  I don't watch --
L:  I --
R:  -- [NOISE] news.
L:  -- I used to and I don't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so much any more, you know, a lot of people are more aware of -- of that stuff after September eleventh and I've had to force myself to be less aware because, um, in the couple of months --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- following September eleventh I had horrible problems with anxiety.
R:  Ooh.
L:  I mean, I don't live anywhere near New York or Washington and I didn't know anyone involved but it still affected me just like it had.  Um, I had nightmares, anxiety and I realized a lot of that had to do with the fact that I was watching the news practically twenty four seven.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I've had to kind of train myself to just watch the news once a day and so I'm not quite as saturated with information as I once was.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, I -- I've had to force myself not to watch television today because of -- you know, I -- I heard them capturing Eric Rudolph and so I'm --
R:  Who?
L:  Eric Rudolph the --
R:  I don't even know who that is.
L:  -- the serial bomber.  He did the, uh -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the Olympic Park bombing and several other bombings in Atlanta and --
R:  Oh okay.
L:  -- Alabama.  They caught him this morning and, uh, I heard about it and the first thing I wanted to do was go turn on CNN but I  -- [LAUGH] I just stay away.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  For my own good I try to stay away.  So, I'm not quite as informed about situations over there as I used to be.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, in fact, I think, the last bit of Middle Eastern information that I actually heard was that Saddam Hussein's oldest son was trying to ne- negotiate his surrender.  And that was --
R:  Negotiate his surrender?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  I don't understand these -- duh.  You know, it used to be they go in and get 'em, now they're negotiating, seeing if he surrenders and --
L:  Well, I -- I understand that we told him basically if you surrender it's unconditional.  And so he hasn't surrendered yet apparently.  But he's trying to got- trying to negotiate it. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, that's the last thing I heard.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Um, that was [LIPSMACK] probably almost two weeks ago but [MN], you know, the Middle East situation is a really touchy one.  Um, I don't know all the ins and outs of -- of who -- who all is involved even, um --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I don't -- I don't understand completely what the basic source of most of the conflict is except, you know, I -- religious difference.  That's -- that's the best I could tell you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Religious difference and control of certain areas of -- of land.  Um, I have a friend who lives in Israel.  She's from England and she's living in Israel and she -- I'm always getting emails from her saying, "We're okay, just in case you heard something on the news, we're okay". 
R:  [MN]
L:  Um, they've got suicide bombings happening in their city all the time.
R:  Oh.
L:  And, uh, I guess they're Palestinians who -- who want to harm Israelis [NOISE] and I guess that's probably the biggest conflict in the Middle East right now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  At least the -- the deepest and most ongoing one.  Um --
R:  I just, I guess -- I don't understand what --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is put into these people's brain when they're growing up to hate each other so much.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, you know, I -- I feel strongly about my religion.  I -- I go to church every week and I feel strongly about my religion but I don't have other people who are not of my religion.  And I cannot imagine killing someone in the name of God.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Can't imagine it.
R:  Well, I can't imagine God wanting anybody to do it either.
L:  Exactly and i- in my heart I feel like -- I -- I'm sorry I don't mean to make this a religious discussion but in my heart I feel like those people are going to find out after they die that they were doing things completely against God's will.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  I don't know, I've been taught there's one God for everybody in the world it's just -- it's a little variated all over the world.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it's still basically just one God.
L:  Yeah, and that's -- that's how I feel too.
R:  You know, their God isn't any better than ours and ours is basically the same God it's just they grew up different.
L:  Right.
R:  And I just --
L:  And --
R:  -- it's, I don't know.
L:  But I -- I -- I can't imagine that God is going to see someone walking onto a bus -- a bus of men, women and children and blowing everything up as -- as a good thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I imagine that it also probably would anger God a little bit to -- to know that people were killing other people in his name.  In -- in -- I -- I would almost say that that's a way of taking the -- the name of the Lord in vain.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, so --
R:  Well, that's -- they don't look at it that way.
L:  [SIGH] Ah, well --
R:  That's -- that's -- well, I'm -- I'm trying to think of who it was when --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- back you were talking about CNN I'd watched part of it and they had some, uh -- I ain't even gonna guess about what he was, Iraqi, Iranian, somebody like that but one of those big religious guys and he flat said, "Our God does not tell anybody to go out and kill another person for religious beliefs".  He goes, "I don't know where they're getting this from".
L:  Yeah.
R:  "How they twisted it around so bad".  He goes, "I just don't understand how this came to be where the Ira- uh, the Palestinians want to kill the Israel- Israelis, the Israelis want to kill the Palestinians, the Iraqi wanna kill the Kuwaits, the Kuwaits wanna kill the Kurds" he goes, "I don't know where it's all coming from".
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it's --
L:  I -- I had a friend in high school who was Muslim and she said that Allah is just another name for God and it's the same God that we worship in my Christian church.
R:  Yeah, that's --
L:  It's just --
R:  -- basically what that guy -- the big religious guy said.  He said --
L:  Yeah.
R:  "Allah, is a God.  God's do not tell people to go kill other people in his name".
L:  Right.
R:  He goes, "It's the twisted factions out there that are creating this problem".
L:  Yeah, and --
R:  But it --
L:  -- it's -- it's sad.  I -- it's things like this that turn people off from religion.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I know -- my brother is an atheist I don't -- well, I don't know if atheists, agnostic, I don- I don't know the difference honestly.
R:  I don't either.
L:  Um, my brother has gone so far as to say he doesn't believe in God because he's so disillusioned by people fighting over religion he says it's gotta all be a sham.  And, uh, I don't believe that but I can understand where he came to that conclusion.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because -- because, you know, religion's fighting each other and killing people and hating each other is ridiculous.  It- it's really ridiculous.  And the conflict over the land in the Middle East I see the basis of -- of that being religion.  It -- it's control of the holy land.
R:  Yeah, and if --
L:  And --
R:  -- it really is holy land, nobody should control it.  It should be open to everybody in the world to walk up on --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- look at, visit and leave when they want to.
L:  I agree.
