L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi -- hi, my name's Judy.
R:  Hi, I'm Nick from --
L:  Okay, and I guess we're just supposed to talk about the topic.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay, how do you feel about heightened security?
R:  Um, I think it's good.  You know, like, it can reduce the chances but, I mean, if they really wanted to do something then they could, I mean --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Theres no- --
L:  Like, well, I was -- I was just thinking, like, like, not to, like, give them credit but I guess these people are pretty smart, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it takes a while to plan out, you know, events like that.  And --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- they di- if they really want to do anything that it'll happen.
R:  Yeah.  There's a [NOISE] --
L:  Like, I think it's pretty easy to sneak [NOISE] different sort of weapons on and they don't check everyone.  Like, I remember flying and I was checked but so many people aren't and I think it's pretty -- I mean, it you're risky enough to try to kill yourself doing things risky enough to [NOISE] smuggle a [several inaudible words] maybe being the one in ten to get searched.
R:  Yeah, and there's just so many different, like, so many airports, so many people, I mean, all it takes is for one person to slip through and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you can't be a hundred percent accurate on everybody but, I mean --
L:  Yeah, I think -- I mean, I think, it's nice and it might put people's fears to rest but I think it's still pretty scary and --
R:  Yeah, I'm like --
L:  -- I think it's causing a lot of trouble that could be just be -- try to only find Middle Easterners, I mean, is what we're most scared of and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.
R:  Exactly, I feel --
L:  They shouldn't use that against us and, you know, I'm sure there's a -- like, a African and other, like, oriental white people who also hate the US and could be drafted and --
R:  Exactly, like --
L:  -- they could use that to their advantage.
R:  Or one just like people -- like Tim McVeigh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or something, it's like people -- Americans who are, like, pissed off with their own country they can do something --
L:  Yeah, like I'm from Oklahoma and, you know, we have the homegrown terrorism here so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] -- it's pretty scary.  Like, you know, the thing -- anything can happen even if things don't happen on airlines there's plenty of other ways they can be destructive or --
R:  Exactly, like, you know, and they could just build one here and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like Oklahoma City, just park a truck or something, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I mean --
L:  So, I mean, it's -- you -- I mean, I think you can stop it but I think maybe it's smartly to look at why they try to commit terrorism than just trying to stop it --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- like, you'll never be able to stop it.
R:  Exactly, and just --
L:  But I think it -- think it is h- high end airport security, I think, puts peoples fears to rest more than it really is preventative at terrorism.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know, like, how -- because, like, it is a lot of money too, I mean.
L:  Yeah.
R:  M- I think you're right justice would be better served if just tried to figure out why they're mad at us and see what we're doing wrong --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because it's not just that they're crazy and they hate us for no reason --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just try to analyze why it happened --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Think about --
L:  And, I don't know, um, it just -- I mean, it's annoying, like [NOISE], um, I remember going and getting into the airport so early and, of course, nothing happened and I just felt like [MN] -- I mean, you understand why it happens but it's still frustrating nonetheless to know that you had to come so early and nothing happened.  And it's just a few people who ruin it for everybody.  That sounds really cliche but --
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  -- you -- you -- I mean, when nothing happens and it ruins or it messes up your day you wanna -- you want it to not happen at all.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So ... [NOISE] But, um, I mean, I'm sure it can happen regardless of what they do so [NOISE] I certainly don't hope they increase it any more [NOISE].
R:  Yeah, I mean --
L:  But I guess I remember talking to people right when it happened.  Like, I had a friend who lived in France for a while and she said every time that they flew to France, or -- or back.  Any time they were in France all of their bags were searched all the time.
R:  Really?
L:  And I guess it could be worse.
R:  Yeah, and, like, I remember just after, like -- just after it happened, like, somebody --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- got a knife onto -- like, a pocket knife or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like -- like, um, some kind of knife onto an American Airlines flight.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And that, like, shut it down, stop --
L:  Or, like, uh, I think that [inaudible] when nine eleven hijackings happened, like, I don't really think they even used their weapons.  Like, I don't think people were stabbed on flights.  Like, some flights we know about at least.  Like, people who called.  And I think that even having fake weapons, like a plastic knife --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I wouldn't know the difference and I think it would probably still scare me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause they're just metal detecting, I don't know whether that's gonna really completely solve any problems.  I guess, ther- what we're getting at is there's no way to completely solve the problem.
R:  Yeah, pretty much --
L:  But --
R:  -- and there's so many things -- so many things you have to cover, so many possibilities and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they're trying to monitor millions of people and all terrorists have to do is worry about themselves and getting through [inaudible] so ...
L:  I don't know, and I think most of Americans have the mentality of, "Oh, that's not going to happen on my flight".
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Like, of cour- I never would have think that it would happen to me.
R:  Yeah, but, you know --
L:  So --
R:  -- I'm sure they didn't neither --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the ones that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- were on it.
L:  [NOISE] Have you -- have you flown since nine eleven?
R:  What?  Uh, no.
L:  Have you flown since nine eleven?  No.
R:  No, I haven't.  I'm gonna fly soon though like, next month.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I remember when it happened everybody would ask, you know, like the first person they knew to fly and asked how it was.
R:  How bad it was?
L:  So, I mean, I don't know [NOISE], I think it's probably a little more relaxed. [NOISE]
R:  I heard -- yeah, it's gotten a little better, I think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like right after -- I mean, afterwards --
L:  Mhm, actually, I remember picking somebody up from the airport, like, uh, probably like in March and, you know, how there's -- like, you can't go in there where th- you board now, you, like, have to stand back, like, at the ramp.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And the security guys were like letting children run down there and just weren't paying attention at all.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Now, it's just like, "We pay you -- we pay you money to make us feel safe" and it was just really ridiculous looking.  Like, they were giving children handstands and -- shifty people could have gotten through, that's just what I kept thinking.  Like, "This is ridiculous" and --
R:  And --
L:  -- not really solving anything.
R:  Yeah, on, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on one hand I like think, like, there might not be enough and they'll still get through but if you take it up to another level then they just start, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- infringing upon our rights and just getting ridiculous so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [inaudible] how much is enough.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, I know.  Are you still there?  Hello?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello, are you still there?
R:  Oh, I'm here, are you?
L:  Oh okay, okay, I couldn't hear anything for a while --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- so I didn't know if our ten minutes were up or anything.
R:  No, I think it beeps or something.
L:  Oh, okay.  I didn't really know what was gonna happen for a while and they told me they would find me another participant and I thought they didn't want to talk to me anymore.
R:  Yeah, like --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- it usually finds one right away but took like --
L:  Oh, this is -- this is my first one.
R:  Oh really?  My third.
L:  Yeah, so [NOISE] but --
R:  You have to do three, right?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Yeah, this is my third one, I think.
L:  Yeah, well then they might choose you to do more.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know what they choose that on but I'd like to keep on making ten dollars for talking on the phone, so ...
R:  How did you find out about it?
L:  Um, I just -- somebody said that, you know, if you wanna make money --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and I didn't think I'd get it because they said they were looking for more guys, like plenty of girls do it but --
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  -- I'm glad I was chosen. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  But, uh, I don't really know what it's for either.
R:  Yeah, neither do I but --
L:  But [NOISE] --
R:  I never talked the whole ten minutes on that subject 'cause, I mean, you just run out of stuff to talk about.
L:  Yeah, like, I don't know maybe if it was -- I don't know something people are really passionate about or, like, at odds on --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that might go if you were like [LAUGH] -- like, if you're talking about politics or religion or something but --
R:  Controversial.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] Uh, I don't know -- what they do -- do you just -- did you make conversation for the next ten minutes?
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  Oh okay, well where are you from?
R:  Uh, from Texas.
L:  From Texas?  Where in Texas?
R:  Uh, Fort Worth.
L:  Oh, Fort Worth, yeah. 
R:  What about --
L:  Well, I'm from -- I'm like, from Norman in Oklahoma --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so, I mean, I've been there a lot. [LAUGH]
R:  Are you in, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- do you go to OU?
L:  Yeah, I got to OU.
R:  Uh-oh.
L:  So, do you go to school in Austin or TCU or ...?
R:  Texas, Aus- --
L:  You go to -- you go to Austin.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Uh-huh, yeah.  Well, you know, [LAUGH] the [inaudible] program brings people together.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Yeah, [several inaudible words] like a really school and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know, but I grew up in Norman and my dad would be really upset if I went to UT.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] My grandpa was -- like, I -- like my mom was joking, "You wouldn't really transfer down there" and I was like, "Well, maybe".  She's like, "Your father would be really upset".
R:  Maybe you --
L:  And I already knew that his feudal[?] blood ran so red.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, [NOISE] I don't know.
R:  Tell him they're gonna lose this year. [LAUGH]
L:  Who's gonna quarterback for you guys this year?
R:  Uh, Kent Knox[?] probably.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Well, you co- you can say that you're gonna lose this year but history seems -- the tide seems to be churning -- turning, so ...
R:  Gonna change --
L:  I think it -- I think it's gonna stay with us.
R:  You gotta a good --
L:  You won't -- you won't have the most wins from now on.
R:  I gotta good feeling this year.
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] I bet you guys had a good feeling the three years.
R:  Yeah, but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Simms has gone.
L:  [NOISE] Something -- this year, this is gonna be it. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, 'cause Simms has gone.
L:  [LAUGH] Simms has gone, yeah.  When did Applewayt[?] graduate?
R:  Uh, two years ago, I think.
L:  Two years ago.
R:  Yeah, the year before last.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Did you -- have you -- did you got to the game or have you ever been to --
L:  No, I've never -- well, I guess I went when I was in, uh, when I was younger.  Like when I was fourteen but -- I mean, it was getting a really trip, like --
R:  Oh yeah --
L:  -- I don't know and I didn't -- like, I've always had season tickets but --
R:  Play [several inaudible words] I went --
L:  What?
R:  -- I went to the last one it -- it was pretty exciting.
L:  Yeah, well being there was just like a fair, it's just like a really neat environment, even if you don't go to the game, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- wh- ...
