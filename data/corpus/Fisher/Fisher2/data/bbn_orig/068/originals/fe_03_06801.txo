R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  My name's Guy.
L:  My name's Aditi[?].
R:  How are you doing?
L:  I'm doing fine thank you, how are you?
R:  I'm doing well.
L:  Well, um --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I guess we are supposed to talk about, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the, um, professional athletes --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- strikes and stuff?
R:  Mhm.  Um, I guess -- I guess you can start it -- just -- yeah, I guess you can just, you know, say how you feel about it. [NOISE]
L:  Well, frankly speaking, I don't know too much about it but, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, I just hear it in the news and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I also look, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- find the -- all the salaries and stuff, I read about them so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- personally, if you ask me, um, some -- I think, sometimes it's just -- um, you know, they're asking a bit too much.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, uh, how do you feel?
R:  Yeah, I -- I definitely agree.  I definitely don't think any one person should, um, be being paid that much money.  Um -- [LAUGH]
L:  Right, especially because, you know, most of these are spectator sports and it's -- you know, with other sp- -- I mean it's not -- not just these players, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um -- but, um -- I mean, I can see the strike is about other things, you know.  For example, um, you know, to enhance their life or -- their home life or family life --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or -- that I can understand, you know -- to relax the rules --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or something.  But, uh, most of these seem to be about, you know, salary negotiation, right?
R:  Right, that's a -- that's a -- that's what my understanding is.  I mean, the right to strike is obviously an -- an extremely important one and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, um, uh, but if -- if it's just to increase an already, you know -- I -- what I would say, like, an over inflated salary, I -- I don't think that's too justified --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but -- but, um ...
L:  I mean, may -- maybe they should, uh, express some other means of, uh, protest or something.  You know, in a sense --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they can strike but, uh, not just at the expense of the -- the spectators or, you know, other --
R:  Right.
L:  -- uh, yeah they can lo- -- I don't know, they can lodge complaints or they can -- I don't know, they can -- I'm sure there are some -- people can come up and create a means of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- protest and stuff, uh ...
R:  Mhm.  I definitely agree.  Um -- [NOISE] the, uh --
L:  So, which -- wh- wh- which -- 
R:  -- but --
L:  -- area are you from?  Sorry, this is nothing to --
R:  What area?
L:  -- yeah, this is nothing, uh, to do with --
R:  Yeah, I'm -- I'm from -- I'm from, uh, Albany, New York.  Where are you from?
L:  Oh, okay, I'm from California.
R:  Oh, crazy. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, Bay area, California, so ...
R:  Oh okay.  Yeah, the, um -- yeah, I haven't been -- I'm not too into sports or --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- any kind of, um, uh, negotiations therefore, but, um -- [LAUGH]
L:  Oh okay, what -- what do you do?  I mean --
R:  Um, I -- I'm into music.
L:  Oh really?
R:  I -- I'm a musician.
L:  Oh okay, what sort of music --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so ...?
R:  Um, mostly I -- I try to lean toward jazz music.
L:  Oh okay.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh okay.
R:  What do you do?
L:  Well, I'm an engineer --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, uh, my husband is a musician.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Yeah.  So, we just -- you know, he -- he -- um, we have a sort of mu- -- uh, studio in our home, so --
R:  Oh wow,
L:  -- or -- or whatever.  I mean, so he -- he --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- writes music and -- and, you know, records and stuff, so it's pretty, uh -- it's pretty cool -- it's a lot of work.  I had no idea, I mean, so ...
R:  It is, yeah.  It -- it's really awesome -- it's, uh -- it's really fun to do.
L:  Mm.
R:  Yeah.  But, um --
L:  So ...  Yeah, so, uh -- but do you watch sports and stuff or --
R:  Um, occasionally, like --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- if -- if I'm with my family or something I'll -- I'll, like, watch.  Um, [LIPSMACK] uh, I like to watch soccer sometimes.
L:  Oh okay.
R:  That's kind of -- that's, uh --
L:  That's fine.
R:  -- anything else like -- I especially -- like -- like -- like, I can never, ever watch baseball.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I can't. [LAUGH]  It's way too long, it's, like, after -- it's, like, I -- it's -- it's just way too long, I -- I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- after, I can't sit -- I can't sit there the whole, entire game of baseball, but --
L:  Yeah, I was --
R:  -- for some reason, I don't know.
L:  -- I can't either.  I mean --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- although there is all this huge fan base here and -- you know, with the, uh -- but, uh, sometimes I watch, actually, football or -- but, you know, uh --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- soccer is definitely a very -- it's fun to watch and, um --
R:  Yeah, yeah, my --, like my -- my whole family, uh, plays, like, soccer, so --
L:  Rea- -- oh okay.
R:  -- yeah, so there you are.
L:  And so, you do too?
R:  I -- I ki- -- I played, like, when I was younger and then I gave it up and became a musician. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, yeah --
L:  Yeah, I come from a pla- -- you know, I come from India so over there, uh, soccer is really popular, so ...
R:  Uh, yeah, yeah, definitely isn't[?] all that popular.
L:  It's a big thing --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- there's the World Cup and stuff and --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- and we all keep awake all night and then we watch -- [LAUGH] I watch.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Whe- -- um, when did you -- when did you come to America?
L:  I came about, uh -- more than ten years back --
R:  Oh wow.
L:  -- actually, eleven years back, yeah.  A long time, so -- but, uh, I don't know whether I've still been -- you know, been totally indoctrinated into, uh, America or not, but, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] But, so -- I mean, I do keep track of some of these sports and stuff and I enjoy some of them but, um, you know, like occasional basketball or something but, uh ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh ...
R:  Yeah, the -- the, um -- I -- it's -- I -- I think -- I think the big times is basically when, um -- when there's, like, big uh -- what do you call them, like, big tournaments or whatever --
L:  Right, right --
R:  -- going on --
L:  -- and, uh --
R:  -- and that's -- that's when I'm likely to watch it.
L:  -- the NBA tournaments and stuff.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, those are -- those are the exciting ones --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- all -- all the other games are just -- just kind of boring.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.
R:  Yeah.  So, uh, I'm -- I'm wondering -- I'm wondering if somebody has to listen to this and, um, [LAUGH] and, like, record all this stuff and it's -- it's real interesting to think so --
L:  I -- yeah --
R:  -- but, um --
L:  -- I don't know what this -- I really want to -- I have to -- I would like to look a little bit more into the project.  I -- I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Oh okay --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think that was the end of ten minutes or something?
R:  What -- they did something, uh, a beep or something?
L:  There was a click, so --
R:  Oh.
L:  I don't know --
R:  Uh.
L:  But, it's pretty -- I'm very interested in linguistics and all these languages and stuff --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, so I -- but I don't really --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- know all the details --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of the project, do you?
R:  [NOISE] No, I -- I really don't, I -- I, um -- I got very, very briefly explained to me, but, I mean, you know -- just to the point of it's a linguistics study, so --
L:  Uh-huh, [LAUGH] same here, so --
R:  -- um --
L:  -- yeah.  So, I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- do want to go in and -- yeah, and it's -- it's just, uh, yeah -- I would like to go -- look at -- at it a little bit more.
R:  Mhm.  See, like --
L:  Can you speak any other languages, um ...?
R:  I don't, I, um -- I don't speak any other languages.  My -- my family all speaks Italian --
L:  Oh real- -- okay.
R:  -- and I -- I -- I understand it but I can't -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I can't really speak it, um -- I don't have --
L:  So, you've heard Italian being spoken around you?
R:  Right, right, right.
L:  Okay, okay.
R:  Yeah and -- and -- and you?  You -- I'm -- I've a feeling you speak -- yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I do know [LAUGH] a couple of others --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and -- and I'm half Japanese so I know a little bit of Japanese too.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  Oh yeah, so, um -- but English, you know, I'm pretty fluent in it so, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- an- and I grew up speaking English too, in the school that is, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- my native language is Bengali, so that's my --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then in India, you know, you kind of learn Hindi and, um -- Hindi as well so a smattering -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- of Hindi.  But, uh -- and now I'm in California I feel I should know Spanish because, you know --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- there are so many people who know Spanish here --
R:  Yeah, I -- I -- I just recently visited there  --
L:  Oh really?
R:  -- and I -- I noticed that, yeah.
L:  Oh okay.  Where did you go?  Uh, where did you --
R:  I -- I went to the -- I went to San Francisco to visit a -- a friend of mine. [NOISE]
L:  Oh okay.
R:  Yeah and, uh, I definitely noticed that.  She lived -- [NOISE] her entire neighborhood was completely Spanish speaking. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I felt so out of the loop, I just needed to -- I need to -- I really need to learn that language, but [SIGH] um, yeah.
L:  Yeah, I sp- -- I live pretty close to, uh, San Francisco so just about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- maybe twenty five miles --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- you know, so yeah -- away from it, so -- south of it -- so yeah, I know what you mean.  And actually the city I live in, um, it's -- it was -- it's one of the oldest cities in this area and a lot of, uh, Spanish -- it has a huge Spanish speaking --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- population --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in this place so -- yeah.
R:  Uh, wh- what is it, what's the name of the -- the city?
L:  It's, uh, Redwood City.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah, it's one of the oldest cities in this place, so yes, I sometimes I think, "Oh, I wish I -- that I knew Spanish", or --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- whatever, so--
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's really awesome. [LAUGH] Yeah, I don't know.  But, um ...
L:  No, I think, uh, we've talked a lot about other stuff than ... [LAUGH]
R:  I know. [LAUGH]  I think -- I think -- I -- I guarantee as part of the study they just have to -- I think, probably they, like, look how many times we stay on topic, [LAUGH] you know what I mean?
L:  [LAUGH] Exactly and then they'll say --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- "Oh my god, they've strayed so many times", and --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, like, "Oh, people from California stay on topic this much", and -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I'm, like, I -- I mean, like, it's kind of hard to talk about this -- uh, sports strikes for --
L:  Mhm. [LAUGH]
R:  -- a good ten minutes.  Like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- unless you extremely follow the news and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like are watching it on every -- like, or, like, your father is, like, doing it or, like --
