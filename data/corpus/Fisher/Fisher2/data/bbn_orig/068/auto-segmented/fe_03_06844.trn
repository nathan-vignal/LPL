[NOISE]  (fe_03_06844-A-0001)
HI  (fe_03_06844-A-0002)
MY NAME IS ELLEN  (fe_03_06844-A-0003)
[NOISE] I'M IN VERMONT  (fe_03_06844-A-0004)
RIGHT [NOISE]  (fe_03_06844-A-0006)
DO YOU REALLY THINK IT HELPS [NOISE]  (fe_03_06844-A-0007)
[NOISE] I'M NOT REALLY SURE I DON'T DO A LOT OF TRAVELING SO I'M NOT [MN] TOO FAMILIAR WITH WHAT IT WAS LIKE BEFORE VERSUS WHAT IT'S LIKE NOW  (fe_03_06844-A-0008)
A LOT OF PEOPLE I'VE TALKED TO ARE STILL SCARED OF FLYING  (fe_03_06844-A-0009)
[NOISE] SO I DON'T KNOW IF IT MAY BE MAKING [NOISE] PEOPLE MORE NERVOUS THAN [NOISE]  (fe_03_06844-A-0010)
IT WAS BEFORE AND MAYBE THAT'S WHY IT'S BETTER [NOISE]  (fe_03_06844-A-0011)
OR IF HAVING MORE PEOPLE THERE [NOISE] IS IS GIVING PEOPLE A  (fe_03_06844-A-0012)
MORE OF A SENSE OF SAFETY  (fe_03_06844-A-0013)
[NOISE]  (fe_03_06844-A-0014)
[NOISE] THAT MIGHT BE TRUE [NOISE] TOO  (fe_03_06844-A-0017)
MAYBE THEY'RE SEEING THE INCREASED AH SECURITY AND THEY'RE DECIDING THAT THAT'S NOT A GOOD THING FOR THEM TO DO  (fe_03_06844-A-0018)
OR AT LEAST NOT AT THAT AIRPORT OR  (fe_03_06844-A-0019)
ER [SIGH] WELL IT WOULD BE EITHER BURLINGTON OR ALBANY  (fe_03_06844-A-0020)
BURLINGTON IS A A SMALLER  (fe_03_06844-A-0021)
AIRPORT SO I'M NOT SURE THAT THE SECURITY WOULD BE AS STRONG AS OUT OF ALBANY WHICH IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE LARGER ONES WE HAVE IN THE AREA  (fe_03_06844-A-0022)
RIGHT WELL IN IN I THINK BECAUSE VERMONT IS A MORE RURAL STATE I MEAN I KNOW HERE NOW THEY'RE REQUIRING PEOPLE TO HAVE A PHOTO I._D. TO EVEN GET ON THE PLANE  (fe_03_06844-A-0024)
WHICH IS PROBABLY NOT A BIG DEAL IN OTHER STATES BUT IN VERMONT WE DON'T EVEN REQUIRE A PHOTO I._D. ON OUR DRIVER'S LICENSE  (fe_03_06844-A-0025)
SO WE HAD PEOPLE WELL THAT'S THE WHOLE PROBLEM IS NOW YOU HAVE ALL THESE PEOPLE WHO FOR YEARS  (fe_03_06844-A-0026)
HAVE NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEMS AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY HAVE TO COME UP WITH ALL THESE FORMS OF IDENTIFICATION  (fe_03_06844-A-0027)
SO YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO GO TO  (fe_03_06844-A-0028)
RIGHT SO THEN THEY HAVE TO MAKE A SPECIAL TRIP DOWN TO THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES AND PAY EXTRA TO HAVE A PHOTO DRIVER'S LICENSE BEFORE THEY LET THEM GET ON THE PLANE SO  (fe_03_06844-A-0029)
RIGHT RIGHT I  (fe_03_06844-A-0030)
I MEAN I'M SURE IF YOU'RE IN A BIG CITY AND YOU KNOW ITS ITS  (fe_03_06844-A-0031)
PROBABLY HAS A HIGHER CRIME RATE OR WHATEVER THAN WE DO HERE  (fe_03_06844-A-0032)
THEN MAYBE IT MAKES PEOPLE FEEL SAFER BUT WHAT I HEAR IS THAT IT'S SORT OF MORE OF A HASSLE  (fe_03_06844-A-0033)
AND ITS YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT AS WORRIED ABOUT IT HERE I GUESS  (fe_03_06844-A-0034)
AND THEY SEE IT TO BE MORE OF A HASSLE THAN  (fe_03_06844-A-0035)
THAN A HELP  (fe_03_06844-A-0036)
[NOISE] OH OH  (fe_03_06844-A-0037)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06844-A-0038)
NO NO  (fe_03_06844-A-0041)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06844-A-0042)
THAT'S TRUE YOU SEE W- EVEN AGAIN IN THE AREA OF VERMONT THAT I'M IN OUR MINORITY POPULATION IS SO SMALL  (fe_03_06844-A-0045)
THAT  (fe_03_06844-A-0046)
THAT MIGHT NOT BE AS MUCH OF AN ISSUE ALTHOUGH PROBABLY IT WOULD IN ALBANY UM 'CAUSE THEY HAVE A MUCH HIGHER  (fe_03_06844-A-0047)
UM RATE OF MINORITIES THAN WE DO  (fe_03_06844-A-0048)
SO I'M NOT SURE HOW THEY WOULD CHOOSE PEOPLE UP HERE IF I FLEW OUT OF SAY THE  (fe_03_06844-A-0049)
BURLINGTON AIRPORT AND MAYBE THEY'D JUST CHOOSE EVERY  (fe_03_06844-A-0050)
TENTH PERSON OR WHATEVER TO  (fe_03_06844-A-0051)
TO GO THROUGH THEIR BAGS [NOISE]  (fe_03_06844-A-0052)
YEAH IT DOES SEEM VERY UNLIKELY THAT SOMEBODY LIKE THAT WOULD BE  (fe_03_06844-A-0053)
YOU KNOW THE ONE THAT WAS [NOISE] GOING TO BE INVOLVED IN A TERRORIST ATTACK  (fe_03_06844-A-0054)
[NOISE] RIGHT LIKE YOU'RE GONNA SAY YES [NOISE]  (fe_03_06844-A-0057)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06844-A-0058)

ARE YOU KIDDING  (fe_03_06844-A-0061)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06844-A-0062)
WELL LIKE THE TERRORIST IS GOING TO SAY YES I GAVE IT TO MY FRIEND WHO PUT A BOMB IN IT YOU KNOW [LAUGHTER] BEFORE THEY GET ON THE AIRPLANE  (fe_03_06844-A-0063)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06844-A-0064)
WELL THAT DOES SEEM SORT OF SILLY I YOU KNOW THE CRIMINAL'S NOT EXACTLY GOING TO MIND LYING TO BEGIN WITH [NOISE]  (fe_03_06844-A-0065)
SURE WELL YOU KNOW THEY AVERT THEIR EYES OR THEY FLUSH OR THEY ACT A LITTLE NERVOUS OR GUILTY OR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT  (fe_03_06844-A-0066)
[NOISE]  (fe_03_06844-A-0069)
RIGHT [NOISE] [NOISE]  (fe_03_06844-A-0070)
NO THAT'S VERY TRUE [NOISE] [NOISE]  (fe_03_06844-A-0071)
WELL I HOPE THEY'RE USEFUL I MEAN  (fe_03_06844-A-0072)
I WOULDN'T AH LIKE I SAID I DON'T TRAVEL A LOT SO IT'S PROBABLY NOT A  (fe_03_06844-A-0073)
SOMETHING THAT I'M GONNA BE TOO FAMILIAR WITH BUT I LIKE TO THINK THAT IF I GOT ON AN AIRPLANE THAT SOMEBODY WOULD BE PUTTING A LITTLE BIT MORE ATTENTION INTO  (fe_03_06844-A-0074)
TRYING TO PICK OUT THE SUSPICIOUS LOOKING PEOPLE OR WHATEVER UM  (fe_03_06844-A-0075)
YE- NO A COMPUTER I CAN'T SEE AS BEING USEFUL AT ALL I MEAN TH-  (fe_03_06844-A-0076)
THERE'S NO THERE'S NO PERSON TO PERSON CONTACT THERE  (fe_03_06844-A-0077)
THERE'S NOT ANYTHING THAT  (fe_03_06844-A-0078)
I MEAN A COMPUTER CAN'T TELL IF YOU'RE LYING OR IF YOU'RE [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06844-A-0079)
YOU KNOW LOOKING STRESSED OUT OR IF YOU'RE  (fe_03_06844-A-0080)
SO THAT THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A VERY USEFUL TOOL BUT  (fe_03_06844-A-0081)
RIGHT WELL AND YOU WOULD THINK TOO THAT IF IF MOST OF THE TERRORISTS ARE ARE OF MIDDLE EASTERN DESCENT THAT  (fe_03_06844-A-0082)
RIGHT THEN  (fe_03_06844-A-0083)
I MEAN I CAN UNDERSTAND I SUPPOSE THAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE YOU WERE DISCRIMINATING AGAINST THEM BECAUSE YOU WERE ONLY CHOOSING  (fe_03_06844-A-0084)
PEOPLE THAT FIT THAT NATIONALITY BUT IF THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE MOST LIKELY TO  (fe_03_06844-A-0085)
BE THE TERRORISTS THEN  (fe_03_06844-A-0086)
SHOULDN'T THEY BE THE ONES THAT YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT ALL THIS  (fe_03_06844-A-0087)
ALTHOUGH MAYBE A B- YOU KNOW TALL BLOND HAIRED BLUE EYED  (fe_03_06844-A-0088)
TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD I SUPPOSE COULD JUST AS LIKELY [NOISE]  (fe_03_06844-A-0089)

I DON'T KNOW WHAT DO YOU THINK  (fe_03_06844-B-0009)
WELL GIVING PEOPLE ON THE TRAVELING END MORE OF A SENSE OF SAFETY AND MAYBE ONE OF THE THING- WHETHER IT'S TRUE OR NOT WHAT THEY ALWAYS SAY ABOUT HAVING A COP ON THE BEAT IS IF THEY KNOW THERE'S SOMEBODY WATCHING  (fe_03_06844-B-0011)
THEN PEOPLE ARE LESS LIKELY TO JUST TRY TO DO SOMETHING  (fe_03_06844-B-0012)
MAYBE  (fe_03_06844-B-0013)
WHAT AIRPORT WOULD YOU GO OUT OF WHEN YOU GO OUT  (fe_03_06844-B-0015)

UH-HUH  (fe_03_06844-B-0017)
BUT EVEN THAT ISN'T LIKE  (fe_03_06844-B-0018)
A BIG AIRPORT LIKE  (fe_03_06844-B-0019)
I DON'T KNOW LIKE CHICAGO OR SOMETHING WHERE IT'S A HUB AND EVERYBODY'S RUNNING IN AND RUNNING OUT SO IT MIGHT NOT MAKE A WHOLE LOT OF DIFFERENCE  (fe_03_06844-B-0020)
IN YOUR LOCAL AIRPORT  (fe_03_06844-B-0021)
MHM  (fe_03_06844-B-0022)

THE  (fe_03_06844-B-0036)
THE SECURITY PERSONNEL REALLY WERE WORKING SO HARD TO NOT PICK PEOPLE THAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE THEY WERE RACIAL PROFILING  (fe_03_06844-B-0037)
BUT THEY SEEMED TO BE  (fe_03_06844-B-0038)
HITTING ALL THE LITTLE OLD LADIES LIKE ME ONLY OLDER OKAY SO PEOPLE LIKE MY MUM'S AGE PEOPLE WITH BLUE HAIR ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT SEEMED TO BE GETTING CHECKED  (fe_03_06844-B-0039)

UNDOING THEIR ZIPPER COMPARTMENTS AND SHOWING THEIR UNDERWEAR IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY IS NOT GONNA CONVINCE ANYBODY THAT IT'S SAFER TO TRAVEL  (fe_03_06844-B-0041)
MHM  (fe_03_06844-B-0042)
MHM  (fe_03_06844-B-0043)

A A PERSON THAT ASKS THE QUESTION IS  (fe_03_06844-B-0060)
IF THE PERSON HAS SOME KIND OF INTUITION THAT SOMEBODY'S UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THEIR OWN ANSWER  (fe_03_06844-B-0061)
THEN THEY MIGHT  (fe_03_06844-B-0062)
YOU KNOW HIT A BUTTON SOMEWHERE AND GET SOMEBODY CHECKED BUT IF IT  (fe_03_06844-B-0063)
MHM  (fe_03_06844-B-0064)
WELL HOPEFULLY THEY WOULD LOOK REALLY NERVOUS OR SOMETHING BUT IF  (fe_03_06844-B-0065)
THE ONLY ONE CHECKING YOU IS THIS COMPUTER SCREEN AND YOU JUST HIT THE COMPUTER SCREEN  (fe_03_06844-B-0066)
THERE IS NO WAY SO YOU  (fe_03_06844-B-0067)

A A SECURITY GUARD WHO FEELS THAT EITHER  (fe_03_06844-B-0076)
TO AVOID HASSLES OR OR JUST I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE THEY LOOK LIKE THE EASIEST PEOPLE TO ASK  (fe_03_06844-B-0077)
IS T- IS TO ASK  (fe_03_06844-B-0078)
OLD PEOPLE WHO WON'T COMPLAIN [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06844-B-0079)

WANT TO LOOK LIKE YOU'RE DOING RACIAL PROFILING BUT I REALLY DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY YOU CAN'T DO SOME KIND OF ROUGH AGE PROFILING  (fe_03_06844-B-0085)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06844-B-0086)
WELL LET'S HOPE NO- NOBODY GETS THE BRIGHT IDEA [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06844-B-0088)
