YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S EASY TO LOOK BACK AND SAY THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS AND THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE THAT BUT IN ALL THE TIMES THAT I'VE FLOWN THE ONLY THING THAT I EVER THOUGHT COULD POSSIBLE HAPPEN IS MAYBE THE PLANE COULD CRASH SOMETIME  (fe_03_06841-B-0047)
BUT I STILL I LOVED FLYING AND I WAS NEVER AFRAID BECAUSE I KNEW HOW SLIM THE ODDS WERE  (fe_03_06841-B-0048)
