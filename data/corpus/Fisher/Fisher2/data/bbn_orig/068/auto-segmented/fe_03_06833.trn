HI I'M CINDY  (fe_03_06833-A-0001)
UH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHETHER THE ATHLETES SHOULD GET PAID HIGH MONEY  (fe_03_06833-A-0002)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06833-A-0003)
I  (fe_03_06833-A-0004)
OKAY  (fe_03_06833-A-0005)
I THINK I DO AGREE WITH YOU BUT THE NUMBER ONE REASON I THINK THEY SHOULD GET SUCH HIGH SALARIES IS BECAUSE THE WORK THAT THEY DO THEY SPEND SO MUCH TIME ON THE ROAD GOING TO DIFFERENT PLACES TO PLAY THE SPORTS SO I THINK THAT  (fe_03_06833-A-0006)
WARRANTS TO HAVE SUCH A HIGH SALARY AND I ALSO THINK THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO STRIKE BECAUSE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THEY MIGHT NEED  (fe_03_06833-A-0007)
THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN GET IT IS BY STRIKING  (fe_03_06833-A-0008)
RIGHT AND THE ENTERTAINMENT OF THEIR SKILLS  (fe_03_06833-A-0009)
OH DEFINITELY IN THE PREPARATION  (fe_03_06833-A-0010)
BECAUSE IT IS IT'S IT'S A LOT YOU KNOW IT'S A HARD WORKING TYPE THING  (fe_03_06833-A-0011)
RATHER THAN JUST SITTING IN AN OFFICE WHERE YOU KIND OF LIKE JUST USE YOUR BRAINS SIT AT A COMPUTER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT'S A VERY PHYSICAL THING  (fe_03_06833-A-0012)
AND THAT TAKES A LOT OUT OF SOMEBODY I THINK  (fe_03_06833-A-0013)
I BELIEVE THAT ALSO  (fe_03_06833-A-0014)
I AGREE WITH YOU  (fe_03_06833-A-0015)
[LAUGHTER] YEAH  (fe_03_06833-A-0016)
YEAH  (fe_03_06833-A-0017)
WELL WHEN WHEN IT COMES TO SOMEBODY LIKE AIRLINE CONTROLLERS THEY CAN REALLY PUT A LOT OF PEOPLE'S LIVES IN JEOPARDY  (fe_03_06833-A-0018)
[COUGH] IF THEY DECIDED TO GO ON STRIKE SO THEREFORE I THINK IT'S OKAY TO SAY NO THEY CANNOT GO ON STRIKE BECAUSE YOU'RE JEOPARDIZING A LOT OF PEOPLE'S LIVES  (fe_03_06833-A-0019)
ABSOLUTELY  (fe_03_06833-A-0020)
EXACTLY BUT WITH SPORTS YOU KNOW IF A GAME DOESN'T GET PL- UH GET PLAYED YEAH MAYBE THE PEOPLE THAT LIKE WORK AT THE STADIUMS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT ARE GOING TO BE OUT OF WORK BUT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET HURT YOU KNOW IF A CONTROLLER WENT ON STRIKE  (fe_03_06833-A-0021)
LIKE WHOA I MEAN THE PLANES ARE GOING TO LIKE LIKE BE IN TROUBLE  (fe_03_06833-A-0022)
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY CAN DO THAT UNLESS THEY CAN LIKE  (fe_03_06833-A-0023)
ARRANGE WITH THEIR  (fe_03_06833-A-0024)
OTHER  (fe_03_06833-A-0025)
YOU KNOW CONTROLLERS TO LIKE EITHER ARRANGE TO TAKE TIME OFF AND MAKE SURE SOMEBODY'S COVERING FOR THEM  (fe_03_06833-A-0026)
AND YOU KNOW JUST LIKE  (fe_03_06833-A-0027)
THAT WOULD BE THE ONLY THING I COULD POSSIBLY THINK OF  (fe_03_06833-A-0028)
THAT TOO  (fe_03_06833-A-0029)
REALLY  (fe_03_06833-A-0030)
OH MY GOD  (fe_03_06833-A-0032)
OH MY GOD THAT MUST BE HORRIBLE  (fe_03_06833-A-0033)
HOW ON EARTH DO PEOPLE GET AROUND  (fe_03_06833-A-0034)
OH MY GOD I'M  (fe_03_06833-A-0035)
GLAD I DON'T LIVE THERE WELL I KIND OF HAVE THIS THING ABOUT THE FRENCH RIGHT NOW ANYWAY [LAUGHTER] I'M NOT TOO HAPPY WITH THEM  (fe_03_06833-A-0036)
WITH YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DID WHEN WE FIRST WENT INTO THIS CONFLICT AND THEY WOULDN'T STAND BEHIND US SO [SIGH] YOU KNOW [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06833-A-0037)
I MEAN I WAS ACTUALLY GOING TO THE POINT OF NORMALLY I'D BUY LIKE A FRENCH MADE PERFUME OR A FRENCH MADE HAIR THING I WOULDN'T BUY IT YOU KNOW I WAS KIND OF LIKE NOT THROWING WINE AWAY BUT  (fe_03_06833-A-0038)
NOT BUYING THE PRODUCTS  (fe_03_06833-A-0039)
IN ORDER TO  (fe_03_06833-A-0040)
SUPPORT MY BELIEFS ON IT  (fe_03_06833-A-0041)
EXACTLY EXACTLY BUT THEN TO FOR THE FRENCH TO LET THEIR WHOLE COUNTRY BE  (fe_03_06833-A-0042)
YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06833-A-0043)
TERMINATED WITH THAT I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT THAT'S INSANE  (fe_03_06833-A-0044)
MY GOD  (fe_03_06833-A-0045)
BUT SEE THE SPORTS GUYS IT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT  (fe_03_06833-A-0046)
HUH TO USE THE WORD LOOSELY BALLGAME FOR THEM BECAUSE YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06833-A-0047)
IF THEY GO ON STRIKE  (fe_03_06833-A-0048)
NOBODY'S GOING TO BE ABLE YOU KNOW NOBODY'S GOING TO HAVE TO STOP GOING WHERE THEY NEED TO GO IT'S JUST THAT OH WOW I CAN'T WATCH THE BALL GAMES TODAY BECAUSE THEY'RE ON STRIKE IT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT THING IT DOESN'T REALLY AFFECT PEOPLE THAT DESPERATELY  (fe_03_06833-A-0049)
LIKE AN AIR- YOU KNOW LIKE A MOBILITY IMMOBILITY OF UH PEOPLE TO MOVE AROUND JESUS THAT'S TERRIBLE [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06833-A-0050)
YEAH 'CAUSE I EVEN WHEN YOU THINK OF UM WHEN THEY HAD THE THING WHERE THE SCREEN ACTORS WERE SUPPOSED TO GO ON STRIKE AND THEN THE ACTORS WERE GOING TO GO ON STRIKE AND ALL THAT STUFF  (fe_03_06833-A-0052)
AND THEY WERE LIKE MAKING T._V. PROGRAMS AHEAD OF TIME BECAUSE OF THAT PROBLEM AND EVERYTHING  (fe_03_06833-A-0053)
THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO GO ON STRIKE AGAIN IT WAS ENTERTAINMENT I THINK IF PEOPLE THAT ARE INVOLVED WITH THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY  (fe_03_06833-A-0054)
WHETHER IT BE SPORTS MOVIES T._V. OR WHATEVER IF THEY GO ON STRIKE IT'S OKAY BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT REALLY AFFECTING PEOPLE YOU KNOW MAYBE IT'S OUR ENTERTAINMENT THAT'S BEING AFFECTED BUT YOU KNOW READ A BOOK [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06833-A-0055)
DON'T WATCH TV [LAUGHTER] OR DON'T WATCH SPORTS BUT YOU KNOW DON'T TELL ME I CAN'T GET TO WORK BECAUSE THE TRAINS AREN'T RUNNING  (fe_03_06833-A-0056)
OR THE YOU KNOW I CAN'T GET TO ANOTHER COUNTRY ON BUSINESS BECAUSE THE AIRLINES AREN'T RUNNING EFFICIENTLY THAT'S LIKE  (fe_03_06833-A-0057)
THAT'S TRAUMATIC AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED  (fe_03_06833-A-0058)
ABSOLUTELY  (fe_03_06833-A-0059)
YEAH THERE WAS SOMETHING I REMEMBER ABOUT THE NURSES I THINK A FEW MONTHS AGO WHERE THERE A BUNCH OF NURSES THAT WERE GOING TO GO ON STRIKE AT A HOSPITAL AND WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT HOSPITAL HIRED A BUNCH OF NURSES THAT THEY IMPORTED WITH BUSES  (fe_03_06833-A-0060)
FOR COVER FOR THOSE NURSES THAT WERE GOING TO GO ON STRIKE I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT WHERE IT WAS I THINK IT WAS LIKE SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA OR SOME PLACE LIKE THAT  (fe_03_06833-A-0061)
AND THEN THE NURSES THAT WERE GOING TO GO ON STRIKE WERE COMPLAINING ABOUT THAT BECAUSE IT WAS GOING TO  (fe_03_06833-A-0062)
REMOVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THEIR STRIKE  (fe_03_06833-A-0063)
'CAUSE I REMEMBER THAT HAPPENED A FEW MONTHS AGO AND I MEAN THEY WERE GOING TO THE TO THE POINT OF THEY WERE BUSSING THEM IN FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE AND THEY WERE GOING TO PUT THEM UP  (fe_03_06833-A-0064)
YOU KNOW LIKE GIVE THEM LIVING PLACES AND IT WAS KIND OF LIKE WELL WHY DON'T YOU JUST GIVE THE NURSES THAT WORK HERE MORE MONEY THEN WE DON'T HAVE TO GO ON STRIKE IF YOU'RE GOING TO SPEND ALL THIS MONEY TO IMPORT PEOPLE  (fe_03_06833-A-0065)
I NEVER SET- HEARD ANYTHING ELSE ON IT IT WAS LIKE THE NEWS KIND OF SHOWED IT WHEN THEY WERE GOING TO BUS THESE NURSES IN AND THEY BUSSED THEM IN AND THEN THE OTHER NURSES WENT ON STRIKE AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY GOT WHAT THEY WANTED OR NOT  (fe_03_06833-A-0066)
YOU KNOW 'CAUSE I NEVER HEARD ANYTHING IT WAS LIKE THE BIG STORY WAS OH THEY'RE BUSSING NURSES IN BUT THEN THEY DROPPED THE STORY  (fe_03_06833-A-0067)
[LAUGHTER] AND I NEVER HEARD ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT IT SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE END RESULT WAS OF THAT  (fe_03_06833-A-0068)
BUT IT KIND OF DEFEATED THEIR PURPOSE  (fe_03_06833-A-0069)
PLUS THEY HAVE THE INSANE HOURS  (fe_03_06833-A-0070)
HI CINDY I'M SULIEN  (fe_03_06833-B-0002)
RIGHT AND ALSO WHETHER THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO STRIKE  (fe_03_06833-B-0003)
AND UM  (fe_03_06833-B-0004)
BASICALLY I BELIEVE THAT YES ATHLETES UH [NOISE] SHOULD BE ABLE TO RECEIVE  (fe_03_06833-B-0005)
UM A HIGH SALARY  (fe_03_06833-B-0006)
AND  (fe_03_06833-B-0007)
AND ALSO THAT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO STRIKE DESPITE  (fe_03_06833-B-0008)
THEIR SALARIES [NOISE]  (fe_03_06833-B-0009)
DEFINITELY ALTHOUGH I THINK THAT UM ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS THEY CAN COMMAND SUCH A HIGH SALARY IS BECAUSE OF OUR SOCIETY WITH THE CAPITALIST OR FAIRLY CAPITALIST UH  (fe_03_06833-B-0010)
CULTURE IN WHICH WE LIVE AND WE'RE CERTAINLY WILLING TO GIVE  (fe_03_06833-B-0011)
UH [SIGH] BASEBALL AND FOOTBALL PLAYERS THIS MUCH MONEY IN ORDER TO PROVIDE US WITH UM THEIR SKILLS UH  (fe_03_06833-B-0012)
SURE A-  (fe_03_06833-B-0013)
ACTUALLY I I DON'T THINK IT HAS AS MUCH TO DO WITH THEIR UM WITH THE FACT THAT THEY TRAVEL ALTHOUGH THEY DO I AGREE WITH YOU THAT THEY'VE VERY DEMANDING  (fe_03_06833-B-0014)
SCHEDULES AND THAT YOU KNOW EVEN IN A  (fe_03_06833-B-0015)
FAIRLY BRIEF UM FOOTBALL SEASON WHAT TO US SEEMS BRIEF UM THEY HAVE TO TRAVEL A LOT THEY HAVE TO SPEND A LOT OF [NOISE] TIME PREPARING AND  (fe_03_06833-B-0016)
YEAH  (fe_03_06833-B-0018)
AND  (fe_03_06833-B-0020)
I ALSO THINK THAT REGARDLESS OF WHAT PROFESSION  (fe_03_06833-B-0021)
SOMEONE TAKES UP OR HOW MUCH THEY'RE GETTING PAID THE RIGHT TO UNIONIZE AND TO UM EMPLOY COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IS VERY IMPORTANT AND AN-  (fe_03_06833-B-0022)
AND THAT'S WHY I THINK THAT UM THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO STRIKE  (fe_03_06833-B-0023)
SO UM  (fe_03_06833-B-0024)
WHAT  (fe_03_06833-B-0025)
SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE IN AGREEMENT ON A LOT OF THESE THINGS  (fe_03_06833-B-0026)
DO DO YOU THINK THAT UH THERE ARE ANY WELL THERE ARE UH SOME GROUPS THAT BY FEDERAL LAW ARE NOT PERMITTED TO STRIKE SUCH AS AIRLINE CONTROLLERS  (fe_03_06833-B-0027)
UH  (fe_03_06833-B-0028)
AND THAT'S SORT OF TANGENTIAL TO THE POINT BUT HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT  (fe_03_06833-B-0029)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06833-B-0030)
I I AGREE WITH YOU UM THEY'RE IN A VERY CRITICAL AND IT'S NOT AN ENTERTAINMENT POSITION THEY'RE IN A VERY CRITICAL UH SUPPORT POSITION WHERE A LOT OF THE NATION'S INFRASTRUCTURE D- DEPENDS ON THEIR ACTIONS  (fe_03_06833-B-0031)
RIGHT SURE AND SO HOW HOW DO CONTROLLERS UH EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT TO  (fe_03_06833-B-0032)
SINCE THEY CAN'T GO ON STRIKE HOW STRIKE HOW DO THEY EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT TO GAIN BETTER WORKING CONDITIONS  (fe_03_06833-B-0033)
I THINK UM ONE THING THAT THEY MIGHT DO IS STAGE A WORK SLOWDOWN IT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN VERY MUCH IN THIS COUNTRY BUT I KNOW IN FRANCE THERE ARE ALWAYS  (fe_03_06833-B-0034)
DEMONSTRATIONS UM BY CIVIC GROU- UM CIVIC UH CIVIL EMPLOYEES UH SUCH AS OH YEAH UM RIGHT NOW ACTUALLY IN FRANCE  (fe_03_06833-B-0035)
UH ALMOST ALL OF THE AIRLINE AND AIRPORT UH EMPLOYEES ARE ON STRIKE  (fe_03_06833-B-0036)
AND UM THEY UH IT'S SIMPLY SHUT DOWN THE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM OH A FEW WEEKS AGO  (fe_03_06833-B-0037)
THE TR- UH TRAIN WORKERS WERE ON STRIKE  (fe_03_06833-B-0038)
FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD IT IS HORRIBLE IT'S  (fe_03_06833-B-0039)
WELL IF IF IT  (fe_03_06833-B-0042)
MHM  (fe_03_06833-B-0043)
RIGHT AND IT SOUNDS LIKE THE FRENCH HAVE SOME PRETTY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ON HOW TO ACCOMPLISH A LOT OF THINGS INCLUDING THE ISSUE OF UH COLLECTIVE BARGAINING BECAUSE  (fe_03_06833-B-0045)
I- IN THIS COUNTRY WHEN AIRLINE CONTROLLERS GO ON STRIKE UH IT WAS A PRETTY BIG FEDERAL DEAL AND UH THEY WERE ALL IMMEDIATELY FIRED AND REPLACED WITH PEOPLE WHO WERE NON UNIONIZED  (fe_03_06833-B-0046)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06833-B-0048)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06833-B-0049)
UM I I AGREE WITH A LOT OF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING  (fe_03_06833-B-0051)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06833-B-0052)
I I AGREE WITH YOU I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU  (fe_03_06833-B-0054)
UM  (fe_03_06833-B-0055)
BUT IT DOES MAKE SOME VERY INTERESTING SPECIAL CASE WHERE PEOPLE WHO ARE  (fe_03_06833-B-0056)
UM DOING CRITICAL WORK FOR A COUNTRY OBVIOUSLY LIKE HOSPITAL WORKERS OR AIRLINE UM AIRPORT CONTROLLERS IF THEY CAN'T GO ON STRIKE HOW DO UM HOW DO WE GUARANTEE THAT THEY  (fe_03_06833-B-0057)
UH HAVE THE SAME PRIVILEGES OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND ULTIMATELY THE I THINK THE UM CRITICAL EMPLOYEES LIKE UM NURSES AND SO ON NEED TO HAVE VERY STRONG UM LABOR LAWS IN PLACE  (fe_03_06833-B-0058)
TO ENSURE THAT THEY GET CONSISTENT COST OF LIVING INCREASES AND  (fe_03_06833-B-0059)
[LAUGHTER] DID IT UM WHAT HAPPENED AS A RESULT DID YOU  (fe_03_06833-B-0061)
IT'S FUNNY  (fe_03_06833-B-0063)
YEAH IT DOES AND ALSO IT UNDERSCORES THE POINT THAT THE UM CRITICAL EMPLOYEES IN OUR COUNTRY LIKE NURSES DON'T GET ALL THE UH PERKS AND MONEY THAT RELATIVELY  (fe_03_06833-B-0064)
YEAH LIKE FOOTBALL PLAYERS GET AMAZING AMOUNTS OF MONEY COMPARED TO NURSES YET  (fe_03_06833-B-0065)
