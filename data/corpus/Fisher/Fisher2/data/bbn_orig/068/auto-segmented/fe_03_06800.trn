[LIPSMACK] UH THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY DO THE WORK DON'T RECEIVE [NOISE] YOU KNOW BUT THEY SHOULD RECEIVE HIGH A A REASONABLE COMPENSATION A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE  (fe_03_06800-A-0020)
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THE OWNERS SHOULD BE MAKING WHAT THEY MAKE I THINK IT'S RIDICULOUS THE PRICE THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO PAY TO GO WATCH THEM [NOISE]  (fe_03_06800-A-0021)
THAT'S THE THING  (fe_03_06800-A-0022)
THEY WOULD THEY WOULD MAKE TONS STILL TONS OF MONEY  (fe_03_06800-A-0025)
WELL THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU COULD REQUIRE THEM IS FOR PEOPLE NOT TO GO  (fe_03_06800-A-0026)
[NOISE] IF PEOPLE DON'T GO THEN THEY LOWER THEIR PRICES I KNOW WE LIVE IN ATLANTA  (fe_03_06800-A-0027)
