THAT'S NOT SO  (fe_03_06826-B-0016)
MHM  (fe_03_06826-B-0017)
SURE  (fe_03_06826-B-0019)
SON KIND OF A STARVING ACTOR IN NEW YORK  (fe_03_06826-B-0022)
NO I THINK THAT UM  (fe_03_06826-B-0024)
WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT MY OPINION IS THAT IT ALL HAS TO DO WITH DOLLARS  (fe_03_06826-B-0025)
UH IT'S A QUESTION OF SUPPLY  (fe_03_06826-B-0026)
AND DEMAND  (fe_03_06826-B-0027)
IF UM  (fe_03_06826-B-0028)
IF GASOLINE  (fe_03_06826-B-0029)
UM WERE TO  (fe_03_06826-B-0030)
COME ON THE MARKET WITH NO HOLD BACKS  (fe_03_06826-B-0031)
AS MUCH  (fe_03_06826-B-0032)
IN THE PIPELINE AS THEY CAN PRODUCE  (fe_03_06826-B-0033)
I THINK PROBABLY IT WOULD DROP DOWN TO MAYBE TWENTY OR THIRTY CENTS A GALLON  (fe_03_06826-B-0034)
AND I THINK IT'S THE SAME WITH DIAMONDS  (fe_03_06826-B-0035)
WHERE THE SUPPLY IS UH VERY TIGHTLY HELD  (fe_03_06826-B-0036)
AND UM  (fe_03_06826-B-0037)
TO THE PEOPLE THAT CONTROL IT ARE KEENLY AWARE OF PRICING  (fe_03_06826-B-0038)
AND I THINK IT'S LIKE ANYTHING ELSE  (fe_03_06826-B-0039)
UM THAT THAT THAT THAT DOES NOT SPOIL  (fe_03_06826-B-0040)
IF THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF IT AND IT DOES NOT SELL AT THE MARKET THEY THEY DROP THE PRICES JUST IN ORDER TO GET RID OF IT  (fe_03_06826-B-0041)
AND IF IT DOES SELL THEN THE PRICE WILL PROBABLY NOT ONLY BE MAINTAINED BUT WILL PROBABLY GO UP  (fe_03_06826-B-0042)
IT'S IF YOU'VE EVER TAKEN  (fe_03_06826-B-0043)
DIFFERENT TYPES OF NUTRIENTS  (fe_03_06826-B-0044)
LIKE PILL OR TABLET OR CAPSULE OR WHATEVER  (fe_03_06826-B-0045)
AT SOME POINT YOU MUST WONDER WHY DOES ONE PARTICULAR THING COST SO MUCH MORE THAN SOMETHING ELSE  (fe_03_06826-B-0046)
AND UM  (fe_03_06826-B-0047)
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY SOMETHING COSTS MORE THAN SOMETHING ELSE CERTAIN THINGS COST MORE  (fe_03_06826-B-0048)
BUT THAT MUCH MORE YOU START WONDERING  (fe_03_06826-B-0049)
AND IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IS HOT  (fe_03_06826-B-0050)
UM GENERALLY THAT'S THE STUFF THAT DOES NOT DROP BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S INTERESTED IN GETTING IT  (fe_03_06826-B-0051)
SO THERE'S A BIG SURGE  (fe_03_06826-B-0052)
AS FAR AS THE ATHLETES THE UM  (fe_03_06826-B-0053)
THEY TRAIN VERY HARD  (fe_03_06826-B-0054)
THEY ARE PAMPERED BECAUSE IF THEY ARE IN A MONEY SPORT THAT SPORT BRINGS MONEY TO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE PAMPERING THEM  (fe_03_06826-B-0056)
IT BRINGS PUBLICITY  (fe_03_06826-B-0057)
IT BRINGS REVENUE AT THE GATE THAT THEY CHARGE IN ADMISSION  (fe_03_06826-B-0058)
AND I I DON'T THINK YOU CAN DENY UH THE POWER THAT A HUNDRED THOUSAND SEATS ARENA HAS  (fe_03_06826-B-0059)
IF IT'S ABLE TO BE FILLED YOU CAN CHARGE IT ANYWHERE FROM FIFTY TO THIRTY DOLLARS PER HEAD  (fe_03_06826-B-0060)
THAT'S THAT'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY ALL AT ONCE  (fe_03_06826-B-0061)
UH SPORTS PEOPLE THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THAT THE ACTUAL ATHLETES  (fe_03_06826-B-0063)
YEAH THE THE ATHLETES ARE UM  (fe_03_06826-B-0065)
IN IN A GOOD POSITION  (fe_03_06826-B-0066)
AND UM  (fe_03_06826-B-0067)
A- A- AS FAR AS THEIR ABILITY TO STRIKE  (fe_03_06826-B-0068)
IF IT WERE A FAR IF A BIG IF IF IT WERE FAR MORE PERFECT WORLD  (fe_03_06826-B-0069)
AND THE PEOPLE THAT CONTROLLED THE PURSE STRINGS WERE MORE THAN WILLING  (fe_03_06826-B-0070)
TO PART WITH WHAT IS COMPETITIVE AND REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THERE'D PROBABLY NEVER BE A NEED FOR STRIKES  (fe_03_06826-B-0071)
WHETHER IT BE SPORTS PEOPLE OR PEOPLE THAT OR WHAT HAVE YOU  (fe_03_06826-B-0072)
BUT THEY'RE PROBABLY NOT AS WILLING AS WE WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT THEY MIGHT OR COULD BE  (fe_03_06826-B-0073)
SO WE OPEN IT UM LEVERAGE IS EXERTED BY THE ATHLETES IT SEEMS  (fe_03_06826-B-0074)
IF YOU DON'T PAY ME  (fe_03_06826-B-0075)
THAT'S ALL RIGHT  (fe_03_06826-B-0076)
SURE  (fe_03_06826-B-0077)
SO THEY JUST SAY IF YOU DON'T PAY ME WHAT I KNOW I'M WORTH  (fe_03_06826-B-0078)
I WILL SIMPLY WITHDRAW AND AT THAT POINT THE PEOPLE WITH THE PURSE STRINGS STAND TO LOSE A VERY GREAT DEAL OF MONEY  (fe_03_06826-B-0079)
SO THEY RELENT  (fe_03_06826-B-0080)
MHM UM THERE IF THEY IF THEY ARE NOT  (fe_03_06826-B-0081)
IF THEY ARE NOT UM TH- THEY ARE PRETTY CLOSE TO  (fe_03_06826-B-0082)
IT THEY'RE PRETTY CLOSE TO IT  (fe_03_06826-B-0083)
WHAT WHAT WHAT IS YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW SPORTS CAME TO BE  (fe_03_06826-B-0084)
