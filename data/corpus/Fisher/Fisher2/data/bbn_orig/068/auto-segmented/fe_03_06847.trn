THE SECURITY'S BEEN PRETTY INCONSISTENT  (fe_03_06847-B-0018)
THEY WILL CHECK THINGS THAT I DON'T KNOW JUST SEEM YEAH THEY'RE RANDOM I MEAN LIKE ONCE THEY CAREFULLY INSPECTED A GAME CUBE  (fe_03_06847-B-0019)
AND IT WAS A GAME CUBE I GUESS IT COULD HAVE BEEN MODIFIED INTO A BOMB BUT  (fe_03_06847-B-0020)

THEY CAREFULLY CHECKED MY THIRTEEN YEAR OLD AND I MEAN TO ME HE LOOKS LIKE A NORMAL THIRTEEN YEAR OLD [LAUGHTER] BUT  (fe_03_06847-B-0028)
I GUESS IT'S BETTER THAT THEY TRY THAN NOT DO ANYTHING AT ALL  (fe_03_06847-B-0029)
YEAH  (fe_03_06847-B-0031)
I GUESS THOUGH SOME PEOPLE WOULD ARGUE AGAINST THE COST YOU KNOW IS IT REALLY COST EFFECTIVE TO DO THIS IF WE'RE NOT REALLY STOPPING ANYBODY  (fe_03_06847-B-0032)

BUT THERE WAS NO ONE AT THE AIRPORT WHO COULD GIVE ME CLEARANCE TO GO MEET MY DAD THEY SAID I HAD TO GET IT FROM THE AIRLINE AND THE AIRLINE WAS ALREADY CLOSED FOR THE EVENING IT WAS ONE OF THOSE LITTLE AIRLINES  (fe_03_06847-B-0042)
I THINK IT WAS FRONTIER OR SOMETHING SO NO ONE WAS AT THE DESK AND SINCE NO ONE WAS AT THE FRONTIER DESK NOBODY IN THE WHOLE AIRPORT COULD GIVE ME CLEARANCE TO GO MEET MY DAD  (fe_03_06847-B-0043)
SOME KIND OF CENTRAL LOCATION MAYBE THAT YOU CAN  (fe_03_06847-B-0044)
YOU KNOW CONFIRM THAT YOU'RE A RELATIVE OF A PASSENGER OR SOMETHING  (fe_03_06847-B-0045)

OH YOU'RE LUCKY  (fe_03_06847-B-0066)
[SIGH] THE FUNNY THING IS THAT MOST OTHER FORMS OF TRANSPORTATION DON'T REQUIRE ANY SECURITY AND THAT'S PROBABLY WHERE THE NEXT TERRORIST THREAT WILL COME FROM IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S UNPROTECTED  (fe_03_06847-B-0067)
YOU CAN GET ON A GREYHOUND BUS WITH A TICKET AND NOT EVEN SHOW YOUR I._D.  (fe_03_06847-B-0068)
