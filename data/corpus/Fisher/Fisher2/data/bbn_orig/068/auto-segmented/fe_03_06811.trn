THEIR UM  (fe_03_06811-A-0019)
THEIR GOALS IN LIFE OR COST OF LIVING I THINK IS VERY UNFAIR  (fe_03_06811-A-0020)
THAT IS VERY UNFAIR  (fe_03_06811-A-0021)
BECAUSE IT'S THE FAMILIES AND AND THE THE MOTHERS AND DADDIES WHO TAKE THEIR CHILDREN TO FEED THEM  (fe_03_06811-A-0022)
AND THEN YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06811-A-0023)
IT'S AN IT'S IT'S AN AMERICAN TREAT TO GO OUT TO TO A FOOTBALL GAME OR BASEBALL GAME LET THE CHILDREN HAVE A GOOD TIME BUT WHEN THEY GET HUNGRY AND YOU GOT TO SPEND SEVEN DOLLARS ON A HOT DOG I DON'T CARE HOW BIG IT IS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T EAT THE WHOLE THING IT'S RIDICULOUS  (fe_03_06811-A-0024)

YOUR FANS  (fe_03_06811-A-0030)
AND DON'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOUR FANS BY HAVING EVERYTHING COST SO MUCH FROM WATER  (fe_03_06811-A-0031)

PEOPLE ARE MAKING MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WHETHER IT'S OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD OR A TEN YEAR PERIOD  (fe_03_06811-A-0037)

AND YOU CAN'T COME IN WITH YOUR OWN SANDWICHES AND POTATO CHIPS AND ALL  (fe_03_06811-A-0053)
SO THAT ALSO HINDERS PEOPLE FROM COMING BECAUSE YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE A GOOD TIME WITH YOUR CHILDREN AND THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE  (fe_03_06811-A-0054)
TRUE  (fe_03_06811-A-0055)
