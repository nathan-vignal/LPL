UM MY NAME'S BARBARA FIRST OF ALL AND THE TOPIC UM IF I HEARD IT CORRECTLY WAS WHETHER WE BELIEVE THAT  (fe_03_06884-A-0002)
THE HIGH LEVEL SECURITY AT AIRPORTS IS REALLY HELPING TO MAKE THEM MORE SECURE  (fe_03_06884-A-0003)
WELL I'VE FLOWN THREE TIMES TO EUROPE SINCE UH SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH AND UM SOME OF THE NEW SECURITY IS VERY REASSURING SOME OF IT I FIND IS JUST ABSURD UM  (fe_03_06884-A-0004)
Y- YOU KNOW IN THE SENSE OF IT- IT'S  (fe_03_06884-A-0005)
YOU KNOW THEY- THEY'RE TARGETING PEOPLE THAT IT'S JUST REALLY RIDICULOUS AND AND OTHER TIMES I'M WONDERING WHY THEY'RE NOT  (fe_03_06884-A-0006)
TARGETING OTHER PEOPLE AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT ETHNIC OR RACIAL OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT I'M JUST TALKING ABOUT UM [MN]  (fe_03_06884-A-0007)

I  (fe_03_06884-A-0011)
WELL I  (fe_03_06884-A-0012)
I THINK IT GIVES THE IMPRESSION OF BEING SAFER BUT I THINK A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE ASSUMING IS HIGH SECURITY IS JUST VISIBLE SECURITY  (fe_03_06884-A-0013)
WHEN IN FACT I JUST READ AN ARTICLE IN A MAGAZINE THAT UH A CUSTOMS AGENT WAS FIRED BECAUSE SHE HAD REPORTED HOW EASY IT WAS FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO PLANES  (fe_03_06884-A-0014)
ON THE GROUND WHO WERE NOT EVEN CHECKED UH AT ALL BECAUSE THEY HAD JOBS THAT WERE SUBCONTRACTED OUT  (fe_03_06884-A-0015)
UM YOU KNOW FOR PEOPLE YOU KNOW SUPPLYING FOOD OR MAINTENANCE TO THE AIRCRAFT AND THOSE PEOPLE DIDN'T GO THROUGH WHAT PASSENGERS WENT THROUGH THEY WENT THROUGH A SIDE GATE WHERE THERE WAS NO CHECK OF I._D.S OR ANYTHING  (fe_03_06884-A-0016)
YEAH  (fe_03_06884-A-0017)
WELL I I DON'T THINK IT'S A QUESTION OF BEING TIGHTER OR NOT I THINK IT'S A QUESTION OF UH WHAT THEY'RE DOING UH  (fe_03_06884-A-0018)
IF THEY'RE GONNA BE REALLY TIGHT CHECKING MY PASSPORT AND I._D. AND EVERYTHING THAT'S FINE BUT WHILE THEY'RE DOING THAT I THINK THEY SHOULD BE CHECKING EMPLOYEES  (fe_03_06884-A-0019)

YEAH AND IF PEOPLE WHO ARE UP TO NO GOOD FIND OUT ABOUT THESE SECURITY LAPSES WHAT'S TO STOP THEM  (fe_03_06884-A-0021)
FROM UM GOING IN THE SAME WAY AS IF THEY WERE AN EMPLOYEE I MEAN I DON'T BELIEVE THAT EM- EMPLOYEES ARE ANY MORE LIKELY TO I MEAN I THINK THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO DO SOMETHING ACTUALLY  (fe_03_06884-A-0022)

IT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE I WAS TRAVELLING ON A FLIGHT WITHIN FRANCE ON A SMALL AIRLINE AND THEY WERE SEARCHING EVERYONE BODY SEARCHES  (fe_03_06884-A-0039)
