YOUR FEELING ON AIRPORT SECURITY  (fe_03_06867-B-0010)
WELL  (fe_03_06867-B-0011)
BEING THAT I LIVE IN NEW YORK AND WITH NINE ELEVEN I THINK THAT THERE'S ALWAYS  (fe_03_06867-B-0012)
MORE WE CAN DO AND THERE'S FURTHER STEPS WE CAN TAKE I JUST THINK THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS TO FIND THE  (fe_03_06867-B-0013)
THE FUNDS YOU KNOW THE BACKGROUND CHECKS THAT WE DO ON THE SCREENERS UH AND I'M SURE YOU'VE SEEN THE PAPER IT'S NOT ENOUGH WE'RE WE'RE STILL GETTING CRIMINALS THERE  (fe_03_06867-B-0014)
UM SINCE NINE ELEVEN  (fe_03_06867-B-0015)
THEY DON'T SCREEN AS OFTEN THEY DON'T DO THE RANDOM LUGGAGE CHECK AS OFTEN SO UH IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT IT WAS A BAD THING IT'S BEEN OVER A YEAR PEOPLE START TO FORGET ABOUT IT AND THINGS  (fe_03_06867-B-0016)
BECOME MORE LACKADAISICAL AND IT OPENS UP NEW AVENUES FOR THE TERRORISTS  (fe_03_06867-B-0017)
YEAH  (fe_03_06867-B-0018)
MHM ABSOLUTELY  (fe_03_06867-B-0019)
WELL EVEN AT THE ALL THE BRIDGES AND TUNNELS WE HAD THE NATIONAL GUARD SET UP AND THEY WERE SEARCHING EVERY CAR EVERY TRUCK AND YOU KNOW AFTER FOUR MONTHS YOU DON'T SEE THAT ANYMORE  (fe_03_06867-B-0020)
SO I MEAN IF THESE PEOPLE WE KNOW THEY'RE PATIENT LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF TIME THERE WAS BETWEEN  (fe_03_06867-B-0021)
THE FIRST WORLD TRADE CENTER ATTACK IN THE NINETIES  (fe_03_06867-B-0022)
AND THEN THE SECOND ONE FIVE SIX SEVEN YEARS BUT THEY'RE PATIENT ENOUGH TO WAIT US OUT 'CAUSE THEY KNOW  (fe_03_06867-B-0023)
THAT AMERICANS ARE NOT PATIENT PEOPLE WE LIKE FAST FOOD WE LIKE FAST CARS AND WE'RE GONNA FORGET ABOUT THINGS AND WE'RE AND YOU KNOW THEY LOOK AT US LAZY RICH AMERICANS  (fe_03_06867-B-0024)
SO AFTER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME THEY KNOW THAT WE'LL BE WE'RE GONNA BECOME LACKADAISICAL AGAIN AND OUR SECURITY STANDARDS WILL DROP AND IF THEY WANT TO GOD HELP THEM THEY- THEY'LL DO IT AGAIN  (fe_03_06867-B-0025)
YEAH  (fe_03_06867-B-0026)
MHM WELL A- AN- AND YOU KNOW WHAT'S FUNNY IS THAT SOME COLLEGES NOW ACTUALLY HAVE HOMELAND SECURITY COURSES YOU CAN TAKE YOU CAN GET A YOU CAN GET A DEGREE IN HOMELAND SECURITY  (fe_03_06867-B-0027)
SO YOU KNOW SOME OF THESE AND IT IT THE THE WHOLE PROBLEM WITH IT IS IS THAT  (fe_03_06867-B-0028)
BETWEEN THE THE RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY THAT WE HAVE WE SPEND ALL THIS MONEY ON THE RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY BUT WE'RE WE'RE ALWAYS TOO SCARED TO ACTUALLY USE IT TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AGAINST TERRORIST ATTACKS YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06867-B-0029)
WE DON'T SECURE OUR WATERWAYS WE DON'T SECURE OUR PORTS  (fe_03_06867-B-0030)
YOU KNOW UM THE PEOPLE AT THE COASTGUARD ACADEMY WHO GRADUATE THEY SHOULD BE THE FIRST ONES THAT GET UM PROMOTED INTO THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY  (fe_03_06867-B-0031)
THEY DON'T  (fe_03_06867-B-0032)
YEAH EX- EXACTLY EXACTLY  (fe_03_06867-B-0033)
MHM  (fe_03_06867-B-0034)
YEAH  (fe_03_06867-B-0035)
YEAH AND THEN AND THEY SAY UM THE REASON THAT THEY WANNA THEY WANNA DO THIS IS  (fe_03_06867-B-0036)
THEY WANNA TAKE A A BIPARTISAN APPROACH YOU KNOW FOR BORDER POLICY DISCUSSIONS AND AND I I YOU KNOW WHEN THEY SAY YOU KNOW GIVEN IT'S HARD GIVEN YOUR POOR BUT STILL IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE THEY SAY EIGHTEEN HUNDRED IMMIGRANTS COME INTO THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY A DAY  (fe_03_06867-B-0037)
YOU KNOW FIVE OF THE NINE SUSPECTS IN CUSTODY UM WERE WERE LIVING  (fe_03_06867-B-0038)
RIGHT WITHIN FIVE MILES OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTER  (fe_03_06867-B-0039)
YOU KNOW SO IT'S IT'S CRAZY  (fe_03_06867-B-0040)
BUT I I DEFINITELY THINK THAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING MORE AT THE AIRPORTS  (fe_03_06867-B-0041)
UH I TH I THINK IF YOU ARE NOT AN AMERICAN AMERICAN CITIZEN THE CONSTITUTION SHOULDN'T  (fe_03_06867-B-0044)
SHOULDN'T AFFECT YOU BECAUSE OUT OF THE NINETEEN UH OUT OF ALL THE HIJACKERS NINETEEN OF THEM VIOLATED THEIR TERMS OF THEIR VISA AND ALMOST EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM HAD INCOMPLETE OR THEY WERE INCORRECT APPLICATION FORMS  (fe_03_06867-B-0045)
SO WH- WHY SHOULD THEY IF THEY CAN'T FOLLOW OUR RULES HOW COME THE CONSTITUTION SHOULD PROTECT THEM IT SHOULDN'T  (fe_03_06867-B-0046)
THEY OVERSTAY THE- THEY OVERSTAY THEIR VISAS THEY THEY COME HERE AS STUDENTS THIRTY THREE THIRTY FOUR YEAR OLD STUDENTS  (fe_03_06867-B-0047)
YOU KNOW IT IT AND WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO STOP IT YOU KNOW I THINK OUR IMMIGRATIONS POLICIES ARE JUST AS BAD AS OUR AIRPORT SECURITY POLICY  (fe_03_06867-B-0048)
ABSOLUTELY THE FIRST TIME WE ACTUALLY SET IMMIGRATION LAWS WAS LIKE IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND IT WAS THAT ALL THE SHIPS THAT CAME INTO UNITED STATES HAD TO PROVIDE A LIST OF ALL THE PASSENGERS THEY BROUGHT ON THEIR VOYAGE  (fe_03_06867-B-0049)
SO  (fe_03_06867-B-0050)
WE NOW NOW WE DO THAT BUT NOW WE GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY NOW ONCE THEY GET HERE TO BECOME  (fe_03_06867-B-0051)
BECOME AMERICAN CITIZENS OR TO GET A VISA TO GO TO SCHOOL BUT THERE'S NOBODY POLICING IT  (fe_03_06867-B-0052)
SO I YOU KNOW I I THINK IT'S MORE THAN JUST AIRPORT SECURITY I THINK GIVING OUT THE VISAS I THINK YOU KNOW THE IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM I THINK ALL THAT IS PART OF THE PROBLEM  (fe_03_06867-B-0053)
MHM  (fe_03_06867-B-0054)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06867-B-0055)
AN- AND THEY HAVE ALL THIS NEW BIOMETRIC TECHNOLOGY NOW THAT THAT UM  (fe_03_06867-B-0056)
EXACTLY AN- AND THE TWO FINGERPRINTS THE DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPH THE RETINAL SCAN BUT IT IT ALL COSTS A LOT OF MONEY AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THEY HAVE TO DECIDE IF THEY WANNA PUT THE MONEY TO THAT OR PUT IT INTO UNEMPLOYMENT SOCIAL SECURITY AND WELFARE  (fe_03_06867-B-0057)
SO YOU KNOW IT IT'S A I THINK IT'S A CATCH TWENTY TWO AND I JU- I JUST THINK THE THING WE GOTTA DO IS WE JUST HAVE TO STOP BEING SO LAX AT THE AIRPORTS AT YOU KNOW AT THE DOCKS AT THE PORTS  (fe_03_06867-B-0058)
UM DOUBLE CHECK THE TRAVEL DOCUMENTS YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06867-B-0059)
AND THEN ONCE A PHOTO AND A FINGERPRINT IS TAKEN THE PERSON SHOULD BE CHECKED AGAINST LISTS OF THOSE WHO SHOULD BE DETAINED FOR YOU KNOW A REASON TERRORISTS CONNECTIONS CRIMINAL VIOLATIONS PAST VISA VIOLATIONS THERE SHOULD BE A CHECK YOU KNOW A A CHECKLIST  (fe_03_06867-B-0060)
MHM  (fe_03_06867-B-0063)
ABSOLUTELY JUST  (fe_03_06867-B-0064)
WELL IT'S JUST LIKE THE THAT SALLY STRUTHERS COMMERCIAL YOU KNOW SHE WANTS YOU TO A- ADOPT A KID IN  (fe_03_06867-B-0065)
IN TAIWAN FOR A DOLLAR A DAY WHEN I GUARANTEE YOU THERE'S A A KID IN RURAL KENTUCKY WHO COULD YOU KNOW WE COULD SUPPORT IN OUR OWN HOMELAND FOR A DOLLAR A DAY  (fe_03_06867-B-0066)
BUT WE ALWAYS YOU KNOW WE'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO BE THE BIG BROTHER TO EVERYBODY AND THEN ALL AND THE OTHER COUNTRIES DON'T APPRECIATE IT I  (fe_03_06867-B-0067)
REALLY DON'T THINK THEY DO  (fe_03_06867-B-0068)
WELL YEAH LOOK AT CONGRESS  (fe_03_06867-B-0070)
YEAH WELL I I TH- I DON'T KNOW BUT THE THE MONEY PART 'CAUSE I KNOW WHAT THIS LAST MONTH CONGRESS APPROPRIATED LIKE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS YEAR ALONE TO ESTABLISH YOU KNOW UM  (fe_03_06867-B-0071)
