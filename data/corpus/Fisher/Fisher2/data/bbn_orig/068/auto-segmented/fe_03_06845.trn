I I MEAN I DON'T THINK THAT YOU HAVE TO NECESSARILY HAVE ON YOU KNOW DESIGNER EXPENSIVE CLOTHING  (fe_03_06845-B-0053)
BUT I THINK THAT WHEN YOU ARE CONTENT TO WEAR  (fe_03_06845-B-0054)
JEANS THAT ER ARE THAT LOOK DIRTY  (fe_03_06845-B-0055)
THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE I SAW SOME AT ABERCROMBIE AND FITCH THE OTHER DAY AND I ABOUT DIED 'CAUSE THEY WERE BRAND NEW AND I MEAN THEY LOOKED SO FILTHY I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN CAUGHT DEAD IN THEM ANYWHERE  (fe_03_06845-B-0056)
