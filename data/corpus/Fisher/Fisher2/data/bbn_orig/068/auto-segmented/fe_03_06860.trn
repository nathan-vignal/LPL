IT'S ACTUALLY A LOT BETTER THAN I THOUGHT IT [NOISE] WOULD BE UM EVEN INTERNATIONAL FLIGHTS HAVE BEEN BETTER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE 'CAUSE I'VE BEEN COMING IN FROM LIKE THE CARIBBEAN AND MEXICO AND STUFF LIKE THAT IT'S NOT LIKE I'VE COME IN FROM EUROPE OR THE MIDDLE EAST BUT  (fe_03_06860-B-0032)
YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S NOT AS BAD AS I WOULD THINK IT WOULD BE BUT YOU KNOW D- DOMESTIC FLIGHTS THE LINES [NOISE] HAVE JUST BEEN STUPID HERE I'M LIKE IN THE DEEP DEEP SOUTH [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06860-B-0033)
AND YOU KNOW SEE HOW THE GOOD OLD BOYS THAT ARE JUST THEY WANNA DO THE JOB AS BEST THEY CAN AND IT IT GETS KIND OF POINTLESS AND RIDICULOUS YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06860-B-0034)
LIKE DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT WE'RE IN THAT MUCH DANGER AND MAYBE IN ALABAMA RIGHT NOW  (fe_03_06860-B-0035)
YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06860-B-0036)
I JUST DON'T SEE US AS BEING A HUGE TARGET  (fe_03_06860-B-0037)
BUT YOU KNOW I GUESS BECAUSE FLIGHTS GO IN AND OUT OF ATLANTA AND EVERYTHING GOES IN AND OUT OF ATLANTA THROUGH THE WHOLE COUNTRY IT SEEMS LIKE  (fe_03_06860-B-0038)
THEY'RE JUST THEY SEEM A WHOLE LOT STRICTER THERE  (fe_03_06860-B-0039)
BUT  (fe_03_06860-B-0041)
I HONESTLY I DON'T KNOW THEY'RE I HEARD SOMETHING THE OTHER DAY ABOUT UM THEY'RE REVIEWING AGAIN WHETHER OR NOT PILOTS COULD HAVE FIREARMS AND  (fe_03_06860-B-0042)
I I NEVER REALLY HEARD WHAT THEY DECIDED ON IT  (fe_03_06860-B-0043)
I THINK IT'S RIDICULOUS BECAUSE I MEAN JUST THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF YOU'RE IN A PRESSURIZED CABIN YOU DON'T WANT A GUNSHOT GOING OFF I DON'T CARE WHOSE SHOOTING WHETHER IT'S THE PILOT OR YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06860-B-0044)
A TERRORIST YOU DON'T WANT A GUNSHOT HAPPENING IN A PRESSURIZED CABIN PERIOD YOU KNOW [LAUGHTER] [NOISE]  (fe_03_06860-B-0045)
WELL I I I THINK THAT  (fe_03_06860-B-0046)
YOU KNOW I THINK THAT IF THE PILOT AND THE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS HAVE LIKE THOSE STUN GUN THE LITTLE VOLTAGE DEALS  (fe_03_06860-B-0047)
I I THINK THAT WOULD BE SO MUCH MORE EFFICIENT YOU'RE NOT IN DANGER OF SHOOTING A HOLE IN THE PLANE YOU KNOW I MEAN EVEN JUST A TINY  (fe_03_06860-B-0048)
BULLET HOLE IF YOU'VE GOT A GUN THAT'S BIG ENOUGH TO STOP A TERRORIST LUNGING AT YOU AND NOT JUST LIKE INJURE HIM BUT JUST STOP HIM IN HIS TRACKS THEN YOU'VE GOT A GUN THAT'S GONNA BLOW A WHOLE THROUGH THE SIDE OF A PRESSURIZED CABIN  (fe_03_06860-B-0049)
YOU KNOW EVEN LIKE A DIME SIZED HOLE CAN YOU KNOW CAUSE TERRIBLE THINGS TO [LAUGHTER] HAPPEN IN THAT CABIN  (fe_03_06860-B-0050)
YOU KNOW AND I JUST THINK THAT IT IF THEY WOULD HAVE THIS HIGH VOLTAGE STUN GUNS FOR ALL OF THE FLIGHT CREW  (fe_03_06860-B-0051)
WELL THAT WOULD JUST BE YOU KNOW IT WOULD BE A WHOLE LOT MORE EFFICIENT YOU'D JUST HAVE TO KEEP THEM CHARGED UP YOU [LAUGHTER] KNOW  (fe_03_06860-B-0052)
AH I THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE THE BEST POSSIBLE OPTION [NOISE]  (fe_03_06860-B-0053)
YEAH  (fe_03_06860-B-0055)
BUT IF THEY'VE ALREADY GOTTEN INTO THE COCKPIT YOU KNOW THEN SOMETHING'S GONNA HAPPEN TO THE PILOT  (fe_03_06860-B-0056)
YOU KNOW IF THEY'VE GOTTEN THAT FAR AS TO GET THROUGH THE COCKPIT DOORS [NOISE]  (fe_03_06860-B-0057)
THAT WOULD BE COOL  (fe_03_06860-B-0059)
THAT [NOISE]  (fe_03_06860-B-0060)
