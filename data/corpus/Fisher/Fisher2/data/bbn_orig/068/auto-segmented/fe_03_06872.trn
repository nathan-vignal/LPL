OH  (fe_03_06872-B-0015)
WELL I REALLY DON'T THINK THAT THE SECURITY MEASURES THEY ARE TAKING ACTUALLY MAKE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE LIKE MY FEELING IS KIND OF WHAT THEY DO AT THE AIRPORT IS  (fe_03_06872-B-0018)
TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL BETTER  (fe_03_06872-B-0019)
UM I DON'T NECESSARILY THINK THAT YOU KNOW IF IF SOMEBODY TRULY WANTED TO GET ON THE PLANE AND DO THAT AGAIN THEY PROBABLY WOULD BE ABLE TO FIND A WAY TO DO IT YEAH BECAUSE I REMEMBER I FLEW  (fe_03_06872-B-0020)
UM ACTUALLY FROM SEATTLE TO UM  (fe_03_06872-B-0021)
PROVIDENCE AND I WENT THROUGH WASHINGTON D._C. ABOUT TEN DAYS AFTER  (fe_03_06872-B-0022)
UM SEPTEMBER ELEVEN  (fe_03_06872-B-0023)
AND THERE WAS I MEAN AT THAT POINT THERE WERE ALMOST NO CHANGES IN AIRPORT SECURITY AND THEY WERE SAYING HOW HEIGHTENED IT WAS AND IT WAS PROBABLY THE SAFEST TIME TO FLY AND I REALIZED WHEN I GOT HOME THAT I ACTUALLY HAD UM ONE OF THOSE LITTLE POCKET KNIVES ON MY KEY CHAIN  (fe_03_06872-B-0024)
AND THEY DIDN'T EVEN CATCH THAT EITHER WAY FLYING SO I MEAN HOW HOW GOOD IS THE SECURITY IF I CAN DO THAT YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06872-B-0025)
BUT AND THEN THEY DO THINGS LIKE  (fe_03_06872-B-0026)
UM I GUESS THAT I NEVER I DON'T FLY FIRST CLASS BUT I GUESS IN FIRST CLASS THEY GIVE YOU LIKE REAL SILVERWARE  (fe_03_06872-B-0027)
EXCEPT NOW THEY WON'T GIVE YOU A REAL KNIFE THEY GIVE YOU A PLASTIC KNIFE BUT LIKE A METAL FORK AND A METAL SPOON  (fe_03_06872-B-0028)
WHICH IT JUST SEEMS SO SILLY TO ME LIKE I FEEL LIKE YOU COULD DO JUST AS MUCH DAMAGE WITH A FORK AS YOU COULD WITH A BUTTER KNIFE [LAUGHTER] YEAH  (fe_03_06872-B-0029)
PLUS LIKE YOU KNOW I THINK GLASSES IF SOMEBODY WAS WEARING GLASSES AND THEY WANTED TO STAB SOMEBODY THEY COULD JUST TAKE OFF THEIR GLASSES AND UNSCREW THE LITTLE YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06872-B-0030)
ARM ON IT THAT ATTACHES TO YOUR EAR AND POKE SOMEBODY WITH THAT I MEAN THERE'S JUST  (fe_03_06872-B-0031)
SO MANY WAYS THAT YOU COULD DO DAMAGE IF YOU REALLY WANTED TO  (fe_03_06872-B-0032)
YEAH AND THE FACT THAT THEY HAD TO HIRE SO MANY PEOPLE SO QUICKLY  (fe_03_06872-B-0033)
I MEAN THERE'S NO WAY THAT ALL THOSE PEOPLE ARE AS QUALIFIED AS THEY CLAIM THAT THEY ARE  (fe_03_06872-B-0034)
THAT'S TRUE THAT IS VERY TRUE WASN'T IT LIKE THEY WERE SAYING THAT AFTER LIKE A FEW MONTHS AFTER UM THE ATTACKS THAT A FEW OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAD ACTUALLY  (fe_03_06872-B-0035)
CAUSED THE ATTACKS WERE GIVEN TOURIST VISAS OR STUDENT VISAS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN THE U._S. YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06872-B-0036)
I MEAN THE FACT THAT OUR GOVERNMENT CAN'T EVEN KEEP TRACK OF  (fe_03_06872-B-0037)
OF WHO THEY'RE GIVING VISAS TO YOU KNOW AND THEN THEY'RE SAYING THEY'RE HIRING THESE PEOPLE TO PROTECT US WELL I DON'T KNOW  (fe_03_06872-B-0038)
THAT THEY CAN'T EVEN FIGURE THAT OUT HOW ARE THEY GOING TO CHECK EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO'S WORKING AT AN AIRPORT [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06872-B-0039)
BUT AND THEN THEY ALSO HAVE THINGS THAT I GUESS WERE UM YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ALLOWED INTO THE TERMINALS UNLESS YOU HAVE A TICKET  (fe_03_06872-B-0040)
BUT IT YEAH SO IT'S ONLY SUPPOSED TO BE P- PASSENGERS THAT HAVE TICKETS BUT I DON'T APPARENTLY YOU CAN GET LIKE A LITTLE COMPANION PASS TO GO IN  (fe_03_06872-B-0041)
YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE TRAVELING WITH A CHILD WHO YOU KNOW IS FLYING ALONE OR IF YOU HAVE AN  (fe_03_06872-B-0042)
AH AN ADULT WHO NEEDS ASSISTANCE LIKE THEY'RE IN A WHEELCHAIR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT  (fe_03_06872-B-0043)
UM SO I MEAN WHAT'S TO STOP SOMEBODY WHO WANTED TO DO SOME KIND OF DAMAGE FROM YOU KNOW GETTING THEIR FRIEND TO PRETEND THEY'RE IN A WHEELCHAIR AND GET THE PASS WOULD BE QUITE EASY TO DO WHAT THEY NEED TO DO  (fe_03_06872-B-0044)
SO  (fe_03_06872-B-0045)
YEAH I JUST I MEAN I THINK FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE U._S. AT LEAST IT DOES MAKE THEM FEEL SAFE WHEN THEY GO TO AN AIRPORT AND THERE'S  (fe_03_06872-B-0046)
YOU KNOW ALL THESE SUPPOSEDLY HIGHLY TRAINED PEOPLE CHECKING AND YOU KNOW ALL THESE HEIGHTENED SECURITY MEASURES UM IT PROBABLY DOES MAKE THEM FEEL BETTER AND SO FOR THAT  (fe_03_06872-B-0047)
FOR THAT FOR THAT SAKE I GUESS IT'S PROBABLY GOOD BECAUSE AT LEAST THERE'S NOT YOU KNOW MASS PANIC THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES BUT  (fe_03_06872-B-0048)
I THINK IF PEOPLE REALLY THOUGHT IT THROUGH THEY PROBABLY WOULD REALIZE THAT IT'S NOT DOING MUCH  (fe_03_06872-B-0049)
YEAH YEAH IT'S I MEAN IT'S DEFINITELY MY FEELING ON IT KIND OF IS WELL THEY DID AN ATTACK BY AIRPLANE CHANCES ARE THEY WOULDN'T DO IT THAT WAY AGAIN BECAUSE THEY THEY'RE KEEPING AN EYE ON IT  (fe_03_06872-B-0050)
UM BUT SO IT WOULD PROBABLY HAPPEN SOME OTHER WAY  (fe_03_06872-B-0051)
YEAH  (fe_03_06872-B-0052)
YEAH IT'S  (fe_03_06872-B-0053)
I DON'T KNOW IT'S IN- INTERESTING SITUATION I MEAN I GUESS MY FEELING ON FLYING IS  (fe_03_06872-B-0054)
IT COULD JUST AS EASILY HAPPEN ANOTHER WAY  (fe_03_06872-B-0055)
BUT  (fe_03_06872-B-0056)
I GUESS I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW WHY IT DIDN'T IT DIDN'T REALLY FRIGHTEN ME THAT MUCH WHEN I WAS ACTUALLY FLEW THE WEEK AND A HALF AFTER NINE ELEVEN  (fe_03_06872-B-0057)
UM THERE WAS PRACTICALLY NOBODY ON MY PLANE  (fe_03_06872-B-0058)
IT WAS JUST BIZARRE I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT FEW PASSENGERS BEFORE  (fe_03_06872-B-0059)
AND AH SO I MEAN OBVIOUSLY IT HAD AN AFFECT ON THE AIRLINES NOW THEY'RE ALL HAVING MONEY PROBLEMS SO OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE U._S. DECIDED THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT  (fe_03_06872-B-0060)
TO FLY DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE THE CHANCE BUT  (fe_03_06872-B-0061)
IT'S JUST SUCH A SAD THING TO HAPPEN  (fe_03_06872-B-0062)
BUT THERE ARE THINGS THEY DO LIKE YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO PARK UM WITHIN A CERTAIN DISTANCE OF THE FRONT OF THE AIRPORT  (fe_03_06872-B-0063)
UM BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY DON'T WANT A VAN DRIVING UP WITH YOU KNOW WHATEVER BOMBS IN IT BUT  (fe_03_06872-B-0064)
YOU KNOW THERE'S SO MANY IN IRAQ YOU KEEP HEARING ABOUT THE SUICIDE BOMBERS  (fe_03_06872-B-0065)
LIKE SOMEBODY COULD TAKE THEIR BIG SUITCASE INTO THE AIRPORT FILLED WITH A BOMB AND YOU KNOW NOT CARE THAT THEY HAVE TO DIE WITH IT AND DO JUST AS MUCH DAMAGE AS THEY COULD FROM PARKING OUT FRONT IN A VAN  (fe_03_06872-B-0066)
YEAH SOMETI- I MEAN SOMETIMES THEY REALLY ARE  (fe_03_06872-B-0067)
AND THEY SAY THAT THEY DO RANDOM SECURITY CHECKS UM YOU KNOW AT THE AIRPORT THAT THEY JUST PULL RANDOM PEOPLE OUT OF THE LINE BUT I DON'T THINK THEY'RE REALLY THAT RANDOM YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06872-B-0068)
LIKE I'VE SEEN PEOPLE ON THE WEBSITE AND THAT YOU KNOW THEY'RE SOME KIND OF UM  (fe_03_06872-B-0069)
ARABIC BACKGROUND OR THEY LOOK ARABIC IN SOME WAY AND THEY'RE ALWAYS THE ONES THAT RANDOMLY GET PULLED ASIDE IN THE AIRPORT  (fe_03_06872-B-0070)
SO I THINK THAT'S KIND OF BUT I DID SEE ONE TIME WHEN I WAS TRAVELING THAT UM  (fe_03_06872-B-0071)
THAT I THEY WERE ACTUALLY HAVING PEOPLE LIKE PULLED FROM THEIR LINE AND ASKED THEM TO GIVE THEM A NUMBER  (fe_03_06872-B-0072)
AND THEN THEY'D COUNT LIKE THREE PEOPLE FROM THE FRONT OF THE LINE OR WHATEVER NUMBER THEY GAVE THEM AND ACTUALLY PULL THAT PERSON OUT BUT THAT'S THE ONLY TIME I'VE EVER REALLY SEEN RANDOM  (fe_03_06872-B-0073)
SECURITY CHECKS EVERY TIME I I THINK THEY'RE KIND OF LIKE OH THAT PERSON LOOKS SUSPICIOUS OR THEY FIT THE PROFILE OR [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06872-B-0074)
YEAH BECAUSE I'VE ACTUALLY THE ONES THAT I'VE SEEN LIKE THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE AT THE GATES YOU KNOW OR THE BAGGAGE WHERE YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH TO THE TERMINAL  (fe_03_06872-B-0075)
UM  (fe_03_06872-B-0076)
THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE STANDING AROUND THERE BUT THEY'RE NOT REALLY DOING ANYTHING USEFUL YOU KNOW I  (fe_03_06872-B-0077)
GUESS IF SOMEBODY TRIED TO BREAK THROUGH AND YOU KNOW GO THROUGH WITHOUT HAVING THEIR LUGGAGE XRAYED THEN THEY'D BE THERE TO STOP THEM BUT MOST OF THE TIME THEY'RE JUST LIKE STANDING AROUND TALKING TO EACH OTHER AS OPPOSED TO  (fe_03_06872-B-0078)
DOING ANYTHING THAT WOULD ACTUALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO THE SAFETY AS FAR AS I CAN TELL  (fe_03_06872-B-0079)
ON THIS PHONE  (fe_03_06872-B-0080)
UM I'VE DONE IT THIS IS MY THIRD TIME  (fe_03_06872-B-0081)
WHAT ABOUT YOU  (fe_03_06872-B-0082)
IT'S REALLY INTERESTING IT'S DEFINITELY WHAT WHAT OTHER TOPICS HAVE YOU HAD DO YOU REMEMBER  (fe_03_06872-B-0084)
