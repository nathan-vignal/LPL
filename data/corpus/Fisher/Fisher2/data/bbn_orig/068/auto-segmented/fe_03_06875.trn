I THINK SECURITY AT AIRPORTS  (fe_03_06875-A-0053)
MIGHT BE A BIT OF A HASSLE I KNOW THAT THERE'S A GENTLEMAN HE LIVES DOWNSTAIRS HE'S FROM SOMALIA SO HE F- HE FITS THE STEREOTYPE  (fe_03_06875-A-0054)
AND HE HAS TO HAVE A CURRENT SECURITY CHECK  (fe_03_06875-A-0055)
UM ALL THE TIME IF HE'S GOING TO TRAVEL A SIX MONTH OLD SECURITY CHECK WON'T EVEN CUT IT  (fe_03_06875-A-0056)
SO IT'S A BIT OF A HASSLE FOR HIM I THINK  (fe_03_06875-A-0057)
SECURITY CHECK MEANING YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE POLICE STATION  (fe_03_06875-A-0058)
YEAH AND YOU HAVE TO PAY A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY AND THEN THEY MA- THEY WR- WRITE A STATEMENT THAT HAS SAID YOU YOU KNOW YOU'RE FREE OF ALL CHARGES YOU HAVEN'T BEEN CHARGED LIKE YOU KNOW OF ALL AND UM  (fe_03_06875-A-0059)

BUT I SUPPOSE AT THE SAME TIME THOUGH IF THEY REALLY WANTED TO GET IN THEY'D FIGURE OUT A WAY  (fe_03_06875-A-0067)
YEAH  (fe_03_06875-A-0068)
BUT IT MIGHT DETER THE SMALL THE SMALL GUYS  (fe_03_06875-A-0069)

IT'S A DIFFERENT STORY ISN'T IT  (fe_03_06875-A-0096)
ESPECIALLY THE AMERICANS YOU KNOW EV- THE WHOLE WORLD KNOWS OR FEELS THAT IF SOMEBODY CAN ATTACK THE AMERICANS THEN EVERYBODY'S IN JEOPARDY  (fe_03_06875-A-0097)
YEAH I HAVE NO IDEA I FORGOT TO CHECK BEFORE I STARTED I  (fe_03_06875-A-0098)

TENNESSEE AND  (fe_03_06875-B-0007)
JUSTIN AND MOSEY  (fe_03_06875-B-0008)
HAVE COME UP WITH A NEW SHOE WELL ACTUALLY SEVERAL TYPES OF SHOE BUT ALL OF THEM SUPPOSEDLY LESSEN THE CHANCE OF AN- OF ANYONE A TERRORIST  (fe_03_06875-B-0009)
PUTTING ANYTHING IN THE SHOE THAT WOULD CAUSE A BO- THE PLANE TO EXPLODE OR TO TO USE ANYTHING IN THAT SHOE THAT COULD HARM THE OTHER PASSENGERS OR PILOTS AND I JUST THOUGHT THAT WAS INTERESTING BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT  (fe_03_06875-B-0010)
THE NOW HEIGHTENED STATE OF SECURITY AT THE AIRPORTS WILL LESSEN THE CHANCE OF ANY TYPE OF TERRORIST ATTACK OR ANY TYPE OF PHYSICAL ATTACKS ON ANYBODY IN THE AIR  (fe_03_06875-B-0011)
RIGHT RIGHT  (fe_03_06875-B-0013)

WELL WHEN I WENT TO THE BAHAMAS LAST YEAR I HAD NO PROBLEMS IN THE U._S.  (fe_03_06875-B-0026)
AND COMING BACK FROM THE BAHAMAS THERE WAS NO ORGANIZED SYSTEM OF BOARDING THE PLANE YOU JUST STAY AT THIS WIND- THIS  (fe_03_06875-B-0027)
THIS DOOR THIS GLASS DOOR UNTIL IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO BOARD YOUR PLANE SO I'M LIKE FIRST OR SECOND PERSON  (fe_03_06875-B-0028)
IN FRONT OF THIS DOOR AND THAT'S WHEN THEIR SECURITY CAME  (fe_03_06875-B-0029)

NOT HERE  (fe_03_06875-B-0042)
YEAH YOU COULD TAKE THEM TO THE GATE AND OR BE THERE AT THE GATE WHEN THEY GOT OFF BUT NOW IT'S LIKE THE MAIN LOBBY  (fe_03_06875-B-0044)
IT DOES IT DOES BUT IT JUST  (fe_03_06875-B-0045)
TAKES SOME GETTING USED TO  (fe_03_06875-B-0046)

SO WERE THEY THE CHECKERS WERE THEY WEARING MASKS 'CAUSE I WOULD ASSUME THAT THAT WOULD BE PART OF THE SECURITY CHECK IT WOULD BE JUST FOR MEDICAL REASONS AS OPPOSED TO AH TERRORIST  (fe_03_06875-B-0055)
MHM  (fe_03_06875-B-0058)
MHM  (fe_03_06875-B-0059)

OH I DON'T KNOW IF THAT APPLIES TO HERE IN THE U._S. OR NOT  (fe_03_06875-B-0072)
PROBABLY SO  (fe_03_06875-B-0073)
