AND THE BOSTON AIRPORT IS KNOWN TO BE VERY UM  (fe_03_06864-B-0015)
UNFRIENDLY  (fe_03_06864-B-0016)
AND THERE WAS A VERY SERIOUS AH STORY A COUPLE OF STORIES THAT FLOATED AROUND THERE AND ONE WAS  (fe_03_06864-B-0017)
THAT ABOUT A YEAR BEFORE NINE ELEVEN A TEENAGE BOY GOT ON A PLANE BY JUMPING A FENCE AND JUST GETTING ON A PLANE AND GOT ALL THE WAY TO EUROPE BEFORE THEY FIGURED IT OUT  (fe_03_06864-B-0018)

YEAH THAT THAT'S A PAIN THAT'S FOR SURE WHAT I THINK IS IT'S MUCH TOUGHER IN A BIGGER AIRPORT THAN A SMALLER ONE  (fe_03_06864-B-0045)
FOR INSTANCE WHEN YOU FLY OUT OF BOSTON  (fe_03_06864-B-0046)
THE LOGAN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT IS IT WAS ALREADY RANKED AS THE THE MOST UNFRIENDLY AIRPORT IN AMERICA  (fe_03_06864-B-0047)
UM VERY VERY VERY TOUGH TO GET IN AND OUT OF PEOPLE ARE MEAN [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW THERE'S NOTHING FRIENDLY ABOUT IT  (fe_03_06864-B-0048)

UM IT SEEMS TO GO  (fe_03_06864-B-0053)
EASIER  (fe_03_06864-B-0054)
SO UM  (fe_03_06864-B-0055)
I THINK A LOT OF IT IS THE FEAR AND UM  (fe_03_06864-B-0056)
COMPLICATION OF BIG CROWDS AND THAT SORT OF THING  (fe_03_06864-B-0057)
I HAVE A FRIEND WHO UM  (fe_03_06864-B-0058)
WORKS IN DENVER  (fe_03_06864-B-0059)
AND AND HE IS IN SECURITY AT THE AIRPORT  (fe_03_06864-B-0060)

MAKE PE- MAKE PEOPLE THINK THEY'RE DOING  (fe_03_06864-B-0062)
MORE THAN THEY ARE  (fe_03_06864-B-0063)
WHEN IN FACT UM  (fe_03_06864-B-0064)
HE THINKS THAT IT'S  (fe_03_06864-B-0065)
A LOT OF SHOW  (fe_03_06864-B-0066)
THERE ARE SOME TOWNS THAT OR CITIES THAT HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE SPECIALIST IN NON VERBAL BEHAVIOR AND THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO SEE WHO HAS UM  (fe_03_06864-B-0067)
UM YOU KNOW SHIFTY EYES OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW LOOKS UNCOMFORTABLE OR WHATEVER  (fe_03_06864-B-0068)
AND UM YOU KNOW HE JUST SAYS YOU KNOW NOBODY  (fe_03_06864-B-0069)
NOBODY REALLY BELIEVES THAT THE SPECIALISTS THEY HIRE IN NON VERBAL COMMUNICATION  (fe_03_06864-B-0070)
CAN TELL A TERRORIST FROM A NON TERRORIST [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW OR WHATEVER UM  (fe_03_06864-B-0071)
I I READ A STUDY ONCE  (fe_03_06864-B-0072)
WHERE A FELLOW UM  (fe_03_06864-B-0073)
A REPORTER WHO WAS KIND OF TALL AND THIN AND UM KIND OF LIKE THE  (fe_03_06864-B-0074)
TYPICAL NERD YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06864-B-0075)
UM  (fe_03_06864-B-0076)
HE  (fe_03_06864-B-0077)
PUT A GUN OR IT WAS A TOY GUN BUT A GUN OR MAYBE IT WAS EMPTY BUT WHATEVER HE GOT IN A WHEELCHAIR AND PUT IT UNDER HIS SEAT  (fe_03_06864-B-0078)

THEY NEVER FOUND THE GUN  (fe_03_06864-B-0081)
SO UM  (fe_03_06864-B-0082)
I HAVE TO THINK IT'S BETTER THAN  (fe_03_06864-B-0083)
THAT IT IT DOES MORE GOOD THAN IT DOES HARM BECAUSE WHO IN THE WORLD WOULD WANT TO GET ON A PLANES WHERE WE ARE NOT BEING VIGILANT  (fe_03_06864-B-0084)

AND THEY DID A GOOD JOB ONLY IT WAS JUST ECONOMIC THAT'S ALL [LAUGHTER] SO THE TERRORISTS DID A GOOD JOB OF MARKET RESEARCH THEY FIGURED OUT WHERE OUR WEAKNESS WAS AND THEY CAME IN AS COMPETITORS IN A WAY YOU KNOW BUT IT'S UM  (fe_03_06864-B-0098)
ESSENTIALLY  (fe_03_06864-B-0099)
