I'VE NEVER BEEN TOO INTERESTED IN PROFESSIONAL BASKETBALL [NOISE] BECAUSE  (fe_03_06814-B-0013)
FOR A LONG TIME I LIVED IN PITTSBURGH AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE A TEAM  (fe_03_06814-B-0014)
OR THEY HAD THESE DREADFUL TEAMS THAT [MN] EXISTED FOR TWO YEARS AND THEY COULDN'T AFFORD PRO MATERIAL SO THEY WOULD HIRE THESE GUYS THAT PLAYED PRISON BALL [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06814-B-0015)
BUT ANYWAY YOU KNOW IT WAS LIKE FORGET IT THERE WAS REALLY NO TEAM AND SO I JUST NEVER PAID ANY ATTENTION  (fe_03_06814-B-0016)

AND AND AND THE MAN EVERYONE LOVES TO HATE AND THEN  (fe_03_06814-B-0030)
HE HE PERIODICALLY TRASHES WHOEVER'S THE MANAGER AND TRIES TO DRIVE THEM OUT  (fe_03_06814-B-0031)
YES IN FACT HE WAS AN OWNER EVEN LONGER  (fe_03_06814-B-0033)
[NOISE] BUT FOR A RELATIVELY BRIEF PERIOD HE WAS FORBIDDEN TO OWN A TEAM BECAUSE OF UM TAX EVASION AND HE WAS [MN] INDITED FOR FELONY  (fe_03_06814-B-0034)
RIGHT SO HE'S A DELIGHTFUL MAN AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE AND  (fe_03_06814-B-0035)
AND HE'S DREADFULLY INTERFERING AT LEAST BY MY MY OPINION AH YOU KNOW I MEAN HE HIRED A HE HAS A MANAGER RIGHT THAT'S JOE TORRE AND THEY HAVE ALL THESE OTHER OFFICIALS THERE AND  (fe_03_06814-B-0036)
STEINBRENNER'S MONEY IS FROM SHIPPING BELIEVE IT OR NOT HE'S FROM THE GREAT PORT OF CINCINNATI [LAUGHTER] BUT SOMEHOW [SIGH] AH HE HAS A LOT OF MONEY FROM SHIP BUILDING AND UM  (fe_03_06814-B-0037)
[LIPSMACK] SO THIS IS LIKE HIS HOBBY EXCEPT HE'S IN THERE A LOT  (fe_03_06814-B-0038)
AND HE SPENDS A LOT OF TIME INTERFERING  (fe_03_06814-B-0039)
[MN] EARLIER THIS YEAR AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE SEASON WHEN THEY WERE DOING [NOISE] EXHIBITION GAMES HE TRASHED TWO OF THE THE BEST LOVED OF THE PLAYERS ONE WAS DEREK JETER WHO IS A VERY CUTE YOUNG SH- SHORT STOP  (fe_03_06814-B-0040)
DEREK JETER  (fe_03_06814-B-0041)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06814-B-0042)
AND AH ANOTHER ONE WAS ONE OF THE PITCHERS AND AH YOU KNOW PEOPLE WERE LIKE OUTRAGED  (fe_03_06814-B-0043)
AND HE CRITICIZED 'EM UM FOR MOMENTARILY LOW NUMBERS EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD WON EVERY GAME FOR LIKE THE FIRST [NOISE]  (fe_03_06814-B-0044)
FIFTEEN GAMES YEAH I MEAN HE WAS IT WAS ABSURD AND NOW HE'S BOUNCING ON THE THE MANAGER JOE TORRE EVEN THOUGH HE'S WON HOW MANY WORLD SERIES AND [NOISE]  (fe_03_06814-B-0045)
AMERICAN LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIPS AND HE [MN] LOOK IT'S JUST IT'S HIS STYLE HE HE DOES IT I THINK TO TEST PEOPLE  (fe_03_06814-B-0046)
TO SEE IF THEY'LL BE TICKED OFF ENOUGH TO LEAVE AND THEN HE ASSUMES THE NEXT PERSON WILL BE CHEAPER  (fe_03_06814-B-0047)
AND SO [NOISE] I I YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW THE THING IS STEINBRENNER FOR INSTANCE SPENDS A LOT OF MONEY ON THE TEAM AND IN FACT MOST OF THE OTHER  (fe_03_06814-B-0048)
[NOISE] TEAMS IN HIS LEAGUE AND THE NATIONAL LEAGUE HATE HIM BECAUSE HE HAS SO MUCH MONEY AND THEY CAN'T COMPETE WITH SALARIES  (fe_03_06814-B-0049)
SO HE CAN BUY WHOEVER HE WANTS AND THAT'S WHY THE THE YANKEES HAVE SUCH A WINNING TEAM  (fe_03_06814-B-0050)
SO SMALLER MARKET TEAMS LIKE PITTSBURGH WHICH IS HASN'T HAD PLAYED WELL SINCE THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES FRANKLY AND I KNOW THAT BECAUSE I USED TO LIVE [NOISE] THERE THEN  (fe_03_06814-B-0051)
UM [NOISE] YOU KNOW THEY'RE BEING DESTROYED BY THIS AND THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS THEY'VE ALL THESE DISPUTES ABOUT PROFIT SHARING AND ALL THIS STUFF  (fe_03_06814-B-0052)
NOW WHETHER THE PLAYERS GET PAID TOO MUCH [LIPSMACK] I DON'T KNOW I MEAN COMPARED TO A COMPANY EXECUTIVE SOME OF THEM WHICH RUN THEM INTO THE GROUND I DON'T THINK SO  (fe_03_06814-B-0053)
I MEAN IT'S A LOT OF MONEY  (fe_03_06814-B-0054)
BUT  (fe_03_06814-B-0055)
[MN] WHEN THEY THEY SAY THEY'RE MAKING YOU KNOW THEY HAVE A NINE MILLION DOLLAR CONTRACT THAT'S OVER SEVERAL YEARS USUALLY  (fe_03_06814-B-0056)
EXCEPT FOR THAT ONE GUY IN UH THE [NOISE] TEXAS RANGERS SO MOST OF THEM YOU KNOW MOST OF 'EM IT'S SPREAD OUT THEY HAVE FAMILIES  (fe_03_06814-B-0057)
UM  (fe_03_06814-B-0058)
[LIPSMACK] THEY PAY TAXES THEY HAVE TO HAVE TWO PLACES TO LIVE BECAUSE THERE'S THE OFF SEASON AND THEN  (fe_03_06814-B-0059)
THEY HAVE TO LIVE SOMEWHERE NEAR  (fe_03_06814-B-0060)
[MN] WHERE THE WHERE THEIR TEAM IS ACTUALLY LOCATED AND THEY THEY HAVE TO TRAVEL AROUND I MEAN  (fe_03_06814-B-0061)
NO IT'S NOT AND YOU YOU IT'S ONLY YOU KNOW THEY THINK A THIRTY FIVE YEAR OLD PLAYER IS AN OLD MAN  (fe_03_06814-B-0062)
OR SOMETHING WHY AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS A LOT OF THEM DON'T UM  (fe_03_06814-B-0063)
I MEAN [MN] THE I MEAN WE HAVE NOW OLD PLAYERS AT THIRTY NINE OR FORTY  (fe_03_06814-B-0064)
SAY IN NEW YORK ROGER CLEMENS IS  (fe_03_06814-B-0065)
FORTY  (fe_03_06814-B-0066)
HE'S AN OLD GUY BY BASEBALL STANDARDS AND HE'S STILL PITCHING HE'S ABOUT FORTY  (fe_03_06814-B-0067)
[NOISE] BUT THE THE THE THING IS THAT THIS IS WHY A LOT OF THEM USE DRUGS TOO FRANKLY BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO EXTEND THEIR THEIR PLAYING CAREER WITH STEROIDS AND WHAT NOT  (fe_03_06814-B-0068)
SO ANYWAY UM I MEAN YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06814-B-0069)
IN A WAY THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY WHILE THEY CAN BECAUSE AFTER THAT THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO MAKE THAT KIND OF MONEY AGAIN  (fe_03_06814-B-0070)
WELL OR OR CAN GET IN OR OR DO SAY BROADCASTING YOU KNOW LIKE BEING ON T._V. AS A COMMENTATOR THERE'S NOT THAT MANY SPOTS  (fe_03_06814-B-0072)
OH SO YOU DO WATCH THAT HUH  (fe_03_06814-B-0074)
[SIGH] WELL SEE I I DON- I DON'T TH- THIS WHOLE THING ABOUT PLAYERS' SALARIES IT'S LIKE SOMEBODY WANTS YOU KNOW BASEBALL HAS PROBLEMS AND OTHER SPORTS H- HAVE PROBLEMS THE TICKET PRICES ARE OUTRAGEOUS I HAVEN'T BEEN TO A LIVE GAME FOR FIVE YEARS BECAUSE THEY'RE SO EXPENSIVE NOW  (fe_03_06814-B-0076)
BUT [LIPSMACK] OH WELL ON THE CHEAP NIGHT WHICH IS LIKE TUESDAY IN THE THIRD TIER I THINK THEY RAISED IT TO LIKE FIFTEEN DOLLARS  (fe_03_06814-B-0077)
IT USED TO BE EIGHT OR TWELVE  (fe_03_06814-B-0078)
OH FOR THE OTHER ONES IT'S THIRTY [MN] IT'S LIKE GOING TO A JAZZ A SHOW OR WORSE THAN GOING  (fe_03_06814-B-0079)
YEAH RIGHT I MEAN  (fe_03_06814-B-0080)
I MEAN LOOK I LOVE THE YANKEES AND OF COURSE NOW IN NEW YORK [MN] THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN SEE [MN] A LOT OF HOME GAMES IS YOU HAVE TO HAVE A S- BUY A SPECIAL CABLE CHANNEL CALLED THE Y._E._S. WHICH IS YANKEES ENTERTAINMENT  (fe_03_06814-B-0081)
WHICH STEINBRENNER DREAMED UP YES  (fe_03_06814-B-0082)
AND AND IT IT'S AND THERE'S ALL THERE YOU WOULDN'T EVEN WANT TO KNOW THE SAGA OF THE CABLE LICENCE AND ALL THIS NONSENSE SO I GO TO THE NEIGHBORS BECAUSE I C-  (fe_03_06814-B-0083)
[LAUGHTER] AND I CAN'T BUY A TICKET AND I CAN'T AFFORD THE YANKEE NETWORK [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06814-B-0084)
AH BUT HE'S ALSO A HOLD UP ARTIST YOU KNOW [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06814-B-0086)
SO TO ME IT'S NOT SUCH MUCH PLAYERS' SALARIES OVERALL THAT ARE THE PROBLEM SAY WITH BASEBALL  (fe_03_06814-B-0087)
OR TICKET PRICES IT'S THE GREED OF THE OWNERS THEY WANT THESE NEW BALL PARKS THEY EXPECT TAXPAYERS TO PLAY PAY FOR THEM AND THEN [NOISE] THEN THEY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SEATS  (fe_03_06814-B-0088)
[NOISE] AND THEY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF BOXES WHICH ARE THE  (fe_03_06814-B-0089)
PICK WHERE THEY CAN RENT OUT TO CORPORATIONS AND DO ON AT A VERY HIGH PRICE  (fe_03_06814-B-0090)
SO EVEN THOUGH THE YANKEE STADIUM IT'S STILL THERE BUT THEY THEY RIPPED OUT SOME OF THE SEATS AND THEY PUT IN MORE BOXES THEY ALL WANT THAT BECAUSE  (fe_03_06814-B-0091)
THE CORPORATIONS WILL PAY WHETHER ANYBODY GOES TO THE GAME OR NOT BECAUSE THEY HAVE BRING CLIENTS AND NYA YEAH  (fe_03_06814-B-0092)
YEAH IT'S IT'S  (fe_03_06814-B-0093)
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT AND IT'S BEEN GOING ON AND IT'S GETTING WORSE  (fe_03_06814-B-0095)
NO SO IT IT'S UM THEY HAD A GOLDEN CALF AND I THINK THEY'VE FATTENED IT AND NOW THEY'RE GONNA KILL IT  (fe_03_06814-B-0096)
I MEAN IT SHO-  (fe_03_06814-B-0097)
SHOULD PLAYERS GO ON STRIKE  (fe_03_06814-B-0098)
WELL LOOK I WAS NOT HAPPY WHEN THEY WENT ON STRIKE IN I THINK IT WAS NINETY EIGHT  (fe_03_06814-B-0099)
I WAS VERY UNHAPPY THAT DESTROYED THE SEASON  (fe_03_06814-B-0100)
OKAY  (fe_03_06814-B-0101)
AND AND I'M I WAS VERY SORRY ABOUT THAT [MN]  (fe_03_06814-B-0102)
BUT UM  (fe_03_06814-B-0103)
ON THE OTHER HAND I I [NOISE] I'M FOR THE RIGHT TO STRIKE GENERALLY AND SO I FIGURE IF BLA- BASEBALL PLAYERS HAVE A UNION  (fe_03_06814-B-0104)
THEY THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO EXERCISE THAT RIGHT I MEAN  (fe_03_06814-B-0105)
