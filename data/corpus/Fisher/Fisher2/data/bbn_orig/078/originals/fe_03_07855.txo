R:  [NOISE] Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  My name's, uh, Frank. [NOISE]
L:  [MN] Frank, uh, my name is Merle.
R:  I'm calling from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. [MN]
L:  Oh, gee.  I -- I'm in Illinois.
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  Yeah, I, um --
R:  You -- you pronounce your O.s very -- very succinctly in Illinois.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] [MN] Not quite as --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [MN] round as Wis- Wisconsin but c- cl- close. [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] Well, I --
R:  We don't speak very clearly here.  We -- we have an accent beyond belief, you know? [MN]
L:  Well, I don't notice anything --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- uh, yet, from you.
R:  Well, I'm -- I'm a bit of a [MN] different kind of cat here in Pittsburgh.
L:  Oh.  Oh -- oh -- oh, [MN] you don't have the [MN] --
R:  [LAUGH] I try to --
L:  -- the native --
R:  -- erase it even though I do --
L:  [NOISE] [MN] --
R:  -- [MN] speak quickly and I do [NOISE] [MN] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- do have a bit of an accent. [MN] But we're supposed to talk about, let's see, for us to --
L:  Oh [MN] --
R:  -- get paid --
L:  -- oh --
R:  -- we're [LIPSMACK] --
L:  -- hypothetical si- --
R:  -- [inaudible] --
L:  -- situation, opening your own business --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, uh, [MN] w- --
R:  How would you go about it? [MN]
L:  And what type and -- and --
R:  [MN] Would you be successful at it, do you think?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's what th- -- I think that's pretty much it or, you know --
L:  If money were not an object.
R:  Right.
L:  W- -- now, wouldn't that be nice?
R:  [MN] Well, then, why open a business?
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, you're right.  I- -- i- -- if money were not an object you wouldn't need to do that, would you?
R:  What the hell, [MN] uh, [MN] I --
L:  [MN] Well, the --
R:  -- mean, you know [MN] now --
L:  -- you've got --
R:  -- what they're -- what they're -- what they're saying --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to you is, and -- and I'm always wondering what these studies are about, whether they really --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- are interested in what we're talking about or how we talk. [MN] 
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  Or --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- or are they really -- or is this about [MN] what kind of phone we use. [MN] But that's --
L:  Whether we scream at each other --
R:  -- none of my business. [LAUGH]
L:  -- or -- o- okay.
R:  But this is, like, a study, you know, and they -- they can --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- skew it with telling us the truth sometimes.
L:  Right.
R:  [MN] So, I'm always curious about that.  But [MN] again, they -- they weren't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- gonna tell me.  But [MN] I --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I would think, [MN] um, uh, if money's not an option and I would open a business and -- and of course money shouldn't be your -- your -- your goal of any -- any kind of business or --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- any kind of pursuit I would think. [MN] Because I would think, if you were --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- er, mm, I'm fifty five so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I've raised my family and everything, married thirty five years, I'm a musician.  I --
L:  Oh, you are?
R:  Yeah.  Jazz musician, singer, all that kind of thing.  And --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And so, I wake up late in the day --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, uh, I've gone through a lot.  You know, Woodstock when I was younger --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- all that stuff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Now, I play piano and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] and, uh -- and -- and -- and when I was younger my wife and I would look and say --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] "Hey, let's open a pizza shop".  I asked my grandfather, "What do you d- -- what do you think grandpa?" [MN] He'd say, " [SIGH] I don't know what I'd do if I had to do it over again.  Or maybe -- maybe real estate" [MN] which would have been good for us, you know?  But now, [MN] I -- money not an option, what then -- [LIPSMACK] okay, I -- I think what is important in life.  And maybe you'll agree or disagree, it's okay, I [MN], you know, that's what this is about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [MN] is I think it's important to be passionate about some- something first of all.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Find something you're passionate about and you love [MN] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and then [MN] -- and then give it all you've got.
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  And then [MN] and so the people can't take their eyes off of you.
L:  [MN] Well, that sounds really good and I think it's great to be passionate about --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- something, I mean, if only we could be.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But [MN] I -- sometimes you don't know whether your --
R:  That's --
L:  -- whether you have this passion for something or not.
R:  That's exactly right.
L:  And it's hard to really find [MN] --
R:  That's what I'm --
L:  -- what you -- what you really, really want to do --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in -- in life.
R:  So -- so, my whole point is --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- most people don't find out what they're passionate about.  Or they've h- --
L:  That's right!
R:  -- they've hidden it their whole life. [MN] They haven't confronted themselves.  They haven't looked in the mirror.  They -- they've -- they've done these little jobs here and there and never really -- their mother told them or their dad told them or someone told them to do this or that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- and -- and -- and -- and, "Oh, look.  Oh, wait.  I -- I like music" or "I liked art" or "I was [MN] -- I was -- oh, I could have been somebody". [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] Well [MN] --
R:  Well, what is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- somebody anyway?  W- --
L:  That's right.  Well, it -- it's great to have a passion and -- and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- [MN] I wish I [MN] could be --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- more passionate about things.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But -- but it's hard to really find that.
R:  Right.
L:  And there are people who have that, who -- who know from --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- early on --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- what they [MN] -- what they're meant to do in life and they just -- they go at it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- with --
R:  Well --
L:  -- full --
R:  -- well, I'm -- I'm not --
L:  -- steam ahead.
R:  -- talking about those crazy people.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  They -- they're gifted, okay?  They're -- they're --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- lucky.
L:  They are --
R:  [MN] Uh, I might b- --
L:  -- lucky.  They're extremely lucky --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because they [MN] -- they have a goal in mind --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and a d- -- the desire --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they go at it and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and make a lifetime.
R:  But when you hit a certain age, let's say fifty --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [MN] someone said the fifties are the youth of your old age and I'm fifty five which is in the middle. [MN]
L:  Well, I'm older than you are. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, that's okay.  That's okay.  Doesn't matter.  You know, I -- my grandfather --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I've a grandfather still alive so [MN], um, which is unbelievable.  But he -- but he has a hundred and three year old girlfriend. [MN]
L:  Oh, my wor- -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- oh, that's wonderful.
R:  Yeah.  And n- -- he -- he worked as a coal miner and had a hard life and my grandmother Maisy died, you know?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But -- but they never had -- they w- -- they struggled but have a -- had a wonderful happy life living in a very small, unassuming house in Florida [MN] and, um, they were happier than anybody I ever knew. [MN]
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, what is happ- -- w- w- what is -- w- w- what causes happiness?  What -- what makes you happy?
L:  Mhm.
R:  A passion, uh, if you don't find your passion that's okay, but if you don't have -- I mean, if you had a hobby let's say --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I'm sure now that we're getting older I wouldn't want to start a business, if I had unlimited money.
L:  At this stage in life.
R:  No.
L:  You wouldn't r- right --
R:  No.
L:  -- now.
R:  No.
L:  [MN] Well, you've kind of done your own thing.  If -- if you're --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in music anyway, you've kind --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of [MN] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- been, uh, [MN] you know, [MN] eh, you're -- you haven't had a nine to five job doing this, you're kind of --
R:  Well, I have.  You cannot make a --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you cannot make a, uh, a living as -- just in music.
L:  Oh, [MN] in music.
R:  No.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, that's -- but that's who I am.  If someone asked me --
L:  So, you kind of do that as a side job? [NOISE]
R:  If someone -- no, if someone asked me what I do --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [MN] what they want to a- -- know is, they want to pigeon hole you. [MN] So, they want to know what I'm -- they want to know what I'm passionate about or how I make money.
L:  Mhm.
R:  How I might make money doesn't make any difference to me.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I do junk mail, I'll tell you because we're on the phone about this, I send mail out to people.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I'm sitting here, I got this phone number to call, you can make thirty bucks an -- okay.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH] I do this -- I'm on the --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- phone all the time anyhow.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK] Okay.  And -- and -- and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so I -- I work for the Catholic church and do some mass mailing and that's how I make my money.  Because everything's disc jockeys now.  I get hired and play piano here or I sing there in New York or whatever, I don't get paid a lot of money.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I do it because I love it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I do it because it's creative, it's my art.  It's what I, uh, it's what -- it's what [MN] drives me.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [MN] It's wh- --
L:  [LIPSMACK] And your life wouldn't be the same --
R:  No.
L:  -- if -- if you didn't have that.
R:  Right.
L:  Uh-huh. [MN] Well --
R:  [MN] And now many people have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- m- -- get married, they fall behind their husband and never really find a passion.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Their husbands are a passion.  That's okay, too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, my -- my husband is in -- [MN] he plays guitar in a --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- country -- country, uh, western band.
R:  Fantastic.
L:  So, he's kind of [MN] -- he makes a little money doing that but he --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- that's not his -- he's a farmer the rest of the time.  But, uh --
R:  Wonderful.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [MN] Now, farmers --
L:  But [NOISE] --
R:  -- are not unappreciated in this country. [MN] And I think --
L:  Well, he -- he [LAUGH] -- he doesn't feel --
R:  -- I f- --
L:  -- appreciated, I know that.
R:  No, of course he doesn't. [NOISE]
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  It's a way w- with what or who -- who do we respect?  We respect money, [MN] we respect --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- the -- we worship --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- at the altar of youth.  We -- we --
L:  [MN] Well, and money is probably number one.
R:  Mhm.
L:  M- money, [MN] you know, uh, what do you do for a living?  And [inaudible] --
R:  What would make your happy in a business?  Do you -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or don't you -- what's your -- you didn't -- you didn't say.
L:  Well, if I -- if I were to -- to [MN] go into a business --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I would like, uh, to -- to do a -- an antique shop and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- [MN] purchase, uh, you know, old things and -- and --
R:  Mhm.  I love old antiques.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [MN] And that -- that -- would be what I would be interested in.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN]
R:  Do you, uh, you know I had some -- and now it's difficult with this Antique Roadshow which everybody's fascinated by.  All the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [MN] the prices have driven -- 
L:  [MN] Y- --
R:  -- been driven through the roof.
L:  [NOISE] That's right.
R:  Do y- -- do you think you'd be --
L:  It makes it harder. [COUGH]
R:  Do you think you'd be successful at it now?
L:  Well, I would think, uh, twenty years ago would have been a lot easier because --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you're right, I -- [MN] so many people [MN] are -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- are so informed now that, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they know more than you know, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so --
R:  And there are [MN] -- people think that there's some stick in their house is worth a hundred dollars. [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] That's right.  That's right.
R:  But, you know, and of course, uh, that is ch- -- y- -- you know, it's hard to find -- I'm sure bargains are out there but I think they're more difficult since th- that show. [MN] 
L:  That's right.
R:  [MN] But I --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- I just love antiques.  I [MN], you know, I -- we ha- -- we, you know, had some in my house.  I wish I would have gone -- I -- it was one of the dreams I had when I was younger [MN] and my wife and I wanted to do that but never did.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  You know, we would go to garage sales and our --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- parents made money --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just going to garage sales and then flea markets selling [MN] lower end stuff, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  [MN] And that's how they spent their retirement and they were joyous about it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And made -- and made money and drove around and, you know, stopped and ate something and it was a way to [MN] -- to spend their r- retirement.  They say in the future we'll have seven jobs in our life.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Everybody will change 'em so many times.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [MN]
L:  Well, that has certainly changed, hasn't it?
R:  Yes.
L:  From what our parents, uh, went through, [MN] --
R:  Our f- --
L:  -- yes.
R:  Our parents had to survive.
L:  [MN] Well --
R:  [MN] I mean, you --
L:  -- and they -- they pretty much started with one job and -- and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- kept it [MN] un- --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- until they retired.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [MN] And --
L:  [MN] And, uh, it -- it is different now.  It's much different.
R:  And they didn't divorce quickly either, did they?
L:  No.  Yeah, well, that comes in there, too, right.
R:  You start -- yeah, well, be- because women, you know, were probably, you know, [MN] had to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- put, you know, with the roles it was, you know, about survival [MN] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and uh, I like the fact that women are more str- stronger now but I don't like the fact that people run away [MN] from, uh, the slightest obstacle --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, in everything.
L:  [MN] Well, that's true, too.  With women becoming more independent and more money --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in -- in their own pockets they feel they don't have to --
R:  What happens to the ch- --
L:  -- stick it out. [NOISE]
R:  What happens to the children, you know? [LIPSMACK]
L:  Yes, that's right.
R:  And, uh, the latchkey kids, you know?  There no dinner time anymore. [MN] Business, you know, and then -- so, what do I do?  What kind of business would I do? [LAUGH] I don't think I would -- I -- I -- my s- son had a business, he's starting new businesses all the time.  He -- he does heal damage on cars.  He goes --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- to -- he goes to Europe and he goes all over --
L:  Oh, he does?
R:  -- he's in Columbus now mak- -- he makes ten thousand dollars a week.
L:  Wow.
R:  But he only works a few weeks out of the year. [MN] But he wants to -- he's an actor.  So, he's acted in New York, in L.A., so he's found a way to make money and pursue --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- his art, pursue his passion.
L:  So, he -- he makes enough money doing this other that he --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- he can --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- really follow what -- what he really wants --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to do.
R:  I said to -- the Romans said once, a long time ago, maybe someone said it before them, "Look you can be [MN] successful [MN] -- uh, it's one thing to -- to -- t- -- it's okay to fail, what's really wrong is -- is to not try".
L:  Right. [MN] Well, I think that's what happens --
