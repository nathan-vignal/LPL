R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello, my name is Carol.
R:  I'm Tammy.
L:  I'm in Los Angles.
R:  I am in Indiana.
L:  Okay, would you like t- to, uh, tell me, uh, your thoughts on, uh -- would you like to open a business?
R:  [LAUGH] Well, there's not very much time to think about it, is it?
L:  I know.
R:  [MN]
L:  I wish I had more time to -- to think.
R:  I know.  I'm thinking --
L:  'Cause they kinda sprang it on us at the last minute.
R:  Yeah.
L:  N- okay, money is no object.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well that was -- that would be the major, uh, drawback for me.
R:  Right.
L:  Because I was gonna say, "Well, if I won the lottery or had some great inheritance from the -- from someone then, um --"
R:  Right.
L:  "-- then, um, that -- that would put an, uh, completely different color on it".
R:  Right.
L:  That would be -- I think something that I think I would practically have to do in order to, uh, make use of my money.
R:  Oh absolutely.
L:  And not -- and not just, uh, let it --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- kind of peter away in the stock market.
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Right.
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, what kind of a business I would like, um, [MN] [LIPSMACK] I'd like a clothing, uh, business and, uh, well, this sounds ch- kind of chintzy but like, uh, used furniture, but good quality used furniture and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- antiques.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh --
R:  That's understandable.
L:  Yeah, antiques would be just great but I -- I know from, uh, speaking to people who have antique stores, uh, the overhead is so high --
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  -- and you're stock just sits -- could sit there for years --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and years.  And you'd better not count on it for --
R:  R- --
L:  -- uh, any -- for income or --
R:  Right [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right.  I know what business I would open.  A dance and gymnastics studio.
L:  Great.
R:  That's what I would do.  Had to think about it for a little bit but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I -- I would need a building and plenty of equipment and lots of little kiddos to run around in.
L:  That sounds like fun.
R:  Yeah, that'd be great.
L:  Of course and you have experience teaching that right?
R:  Yes.  I used to --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- teach gymnastics and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- have lots of background in --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- cheerleading and dance and tumbling and everything so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that would be wonderful.  And I love working with kids so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that would be a lot of fun.
L:  That -- that really -- I can envision that -- that -- that definitely like fun if you have the training.
R:  Yes.
L:  And I think there's the key.  The person --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- uh, like myself.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I was scanning my brain --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to think, well what do I know how to do?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, I -- I know, uh, I know antiques.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Although that wouldn't -- I think be kind of boring to just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- sit around and wait for somebody to walk in --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- your shop.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Um --
R:  The finding them might be interesting though.
L:  There, and that comes -- thank you for reminding me that, uh, we have just unlimited money.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That would just be great.
R:  Yeah.  [MN]
L:  Because you could travel.  I know people travel in Europe but then they have --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to, uh, do it on a budget in order to try to buy antiques --
R:  Right.
L:  -- on a budget.  So if all that -- if all that was removed, I tell ya, that would be just wonderful.
R:  That'd be fun.  That'd be a lot of fun.
L:  Yeah.  And not have to worry about, "Am I going to be able to make the money --"
R:  Right.
L:  "-- from the stuff I buy in, uh, Germany or wherever and --"
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Another one I would wanna open is a -- some kind of [NOISE] dental or dental hygiene clinic --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for underprivileged children.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- and or adults.  I mean --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if money was no option then --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it'd be for everybody 'cause --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I think that your teeth are important --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I have training in that area. [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I think that would be great and that's just a matter of a building --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and equipment and the right people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to help you do the jobs. [NOISE]  Uh!
L:  Well, as a middle aged woman who was left, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a widow.
R:  There you go.  I'm sorry.
L:  And my husband's, um, [LIPSMACK] -- my husband's last illness took all of our money.
R:  Mm.
L:  And I -- I found out [MN] how difficult it is to, uh, recoup after something like that, I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  --  for a business I would like to, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- another business, I would like to buy, um, apartment buildings in, uh, reasonably nice areas.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, that are decent living areas.
R:  Right.
L:  I'm not talking about, um, uh, h- shelter, uh, homeless shelters.
R:  Right, right.
L:  I'm talking about nice areas where, uh, people who were in, uh, dire straits, uh, I would just let them pay very, very, uh, very low rent, and you would be surprised [SIGH] w- in a -- a city like Los Angeles or in --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I know the -- the cities, there is no reasonable rent for, uh, [LIPSMACK] for people who -- who don't have much income or living on a pension.
R:  No.
L:  It's very bad.  There's a lot of, uh, I used to work as a -- a volunteer for, um, the missions --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, there's a mission what we call here in LA, uh, on the skid row.
R:  [NOISE] Oh yeah.
L:  And there is so many, uh, people who've contribute to those missions, we served wonderful meals, wonderful food, but yet that was the people who are down on skid row.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And many people will not go there and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- don't belong there.
R:  Right.
L:  They're just, uh, they're usually women who --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, get very low, very, very low social security.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because they only get half of what their husbands' was.
R:  Mm.
L:  I don't know where they ever got the idea that a widow can live on half of what they had before, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The -- the landlord is going to want the same rent.
R:  Right.
L:  Just because your husband died he's gonna want the same rent.
R:  Right.
L:  I'm diverging from -- from the subject too much, but I would love -- that would be the main thing, I think that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- there's such a need for, uh, reasonable [LIPSMACK] rents for, uh --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- people in dire straits.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  And single women with -- with children too.
R:  Mhm.  That would be good too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  There's -- there's so many --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- people who don't deserve to live in poverty stricken areas --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- who just can't seem to make it but yet --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they don't belong in those areas.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So apartments like that would be good, yeah.
L:  Yeah, but the, uh, [SIGH] not, uh, well the elderly and, uh, the not quite elderly, uh --
R:  Right.
L:  Say fifty eight to sixty --
R:  Right.
L:  -- five.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, they cannot get health -- healthcare either.
R:  No, I know.
L:  Till you're sixty five you can't get so- --
R:  Right.
L:  That would be -- I would like to start a business, a fund, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like a foundation that would pay for, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- healthcare --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- for people who are --
R:  -- to assist with healthcare.
L:  -- that are not old enough --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for, uh, Medicare.
R:  Right.
L:  And they're not poor enough for, uh, uh, medical assistance.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So that they have nothing.
R:  Yeah.  There is so many in betweeners that --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- that get overlooked.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's a great idea. [NOISE]  Um ...
L:  Well, I -- I think the gymnastics just -- just sounds great.
R:  Oh, I would absolutely love that.
L:  Mhm.  And the thing is, like, we're -- we're gonna be ... [MN] let's pretend.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We're going to be given all this money and then you don't have to worry about your overhead and you can charge, you know, a reasonable --
R:  Right.
L:  -- uh, charge and not --
R:  Right.
L:  -- have to, uh, charge a lot --
R:  So it's not just the rich kids that can go.
L:  -- because of the electri- -- the electricity, I don't know how electricity is in your state --
R:  Yeah.  Oh no --
L:  But here it's -- we, uh, in California we had a terrible, uh, crisis a couple of years ago.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  And it's left the rates, uh, so high.
R:  Wow, I can [MN] --
L:  A lot of, uh, businesses, small businesses, closed down because they couldn't afford the, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- electric, and that was --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the, uh, your lights for -- in your big building.
R:  Right.
L:  In your s- like --
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  -- studio.
R:  Yes. [NOISE]
L:  In the evening.
R:  I used to have [NOISE] --
L:  And air conditioning in the summer.
R:  Definitely need air conditioning.
L:  That w- -- that would be, uh, an expense --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, uh --
R:  We have huge mats --
L:  -- if you had unlimited money you just look -- it would look so enjoyable.
R:  Oh, that would be so fun.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We'd have huge mats and trampolines --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and individual sound systems for a separate dance studio inside --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and we'd have --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- all ages, from age two on up through adults and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'm thinking that geriatric classes would be pretty fun too, as far as --
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  -- some slower --
L:  Uh, mhm.
R:  -- dancing and stretching and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- maybe some yoga classes and --
L:  I was just gonna ask you, do you --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- have any experience in yoga?
R:  I don't have experience in yoga --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I could find somebody who did and have them --
L:  Mhm, sure.
R:  -- teach classes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That'd be fun.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That would be really neat.
L:  As an older person I -- I do, uh, I do yoga.
R:  Uh-huh.  So we can --
L:  Very gently! [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah!  Yeah.  We -- 
L:  And it's very beneficial.
R:  I would probably even -- I'd probably even want to, if money was no option, have a medic on hand as far as stumbles and tumbles and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, 'cause bones get broken sometimes doing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- different stunts and --
L:  Oh, that's another big cost to a business, is your insurance.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So with unlimited funds
