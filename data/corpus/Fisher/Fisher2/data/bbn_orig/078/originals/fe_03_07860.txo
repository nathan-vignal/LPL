R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, how ya doing?  My name is Francine.
R:  I'm Tammy.
L:  Nice to meet you.
R:  You too.
L:  Well, the topic, I -- that's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- something I've been thinking about.
R:  Uh-huh.  What --
L:  You got kids?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that's what the topic -- that's what I was thinking about like, opening up a business for children clothes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause everybody have kids.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You knows -- you know, everything geared toward children.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, you got, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- splurgy parents, you got the educational parents.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, the spo- -- and the spoiler parents.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So they can just come in the store and just go do what they wanna do, but that's the type of business I would like to open up.
R:  That would be great.  People need -- children are such a joy to do everything with.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, any kinda store, especially -- what kind of items would you sell in your store?
L:  Ch- clothing.
R:  Clothing.
L:  Novelty gifts.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Educational toys.
R:  Everything then.
L:  Like, you know, hands on.  Hands on --
R:  Right[?].
L:  Hands on, where they can come and play.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you know.  But [MN] [MN] [MN] --
R:  Try to test it out a little bit.
L:  Huh?
R:  They can come and test it out a little bit.
L:  Yeah, like -- like, uh, usually you go to the store and you have something for the kids, this will be where the kids can come and the parents can rest.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, sit down and staff --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- look like, you know, the staff would be the babysitters.
R:  Yes.
L:  And then they can make their purchases if they want.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But the parents would be able to sit down and rest.
R:  That would be fun.
L:  You know, something like that.
R:  That would be fun.
L:  And you can get -- and, you know, anything for children from inf- -- from b- um, infants --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to about maybe ten years old.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's the -- yeah, I just wanna have a --
R:  That sounds like a --
L:  -- cut off mayb- -- yeah.
R:  That sounds like a good range.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's great.  Well, I would probably want to open a dance and [NOISE] gymnastics studio.
L:  Mm, that sound good.
R:  That would -- it would be for children from around two years old and we'd probably go all the way up to having some kind of geriatric classes --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- even -- even if it was just for yoga or --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- different things like that, I think that'd be great.  And just because those are things that I love.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I've taught gymnastics before so I --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- do have experience in it, and I think that'd be great.  One thing I would wanna have is, uh, if money were no option --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I would wanna have a full time medic --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- on hand. [NOISE]
L:  Right.
R:  Um, pay somebody to just be there in case anything happened.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, [NOISE] do that.  Let's see, what else?  Um ...  I'd have to hire somebody for the yoga part 'cause I don't know anything about yoga.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And [NOISE], uh ... we'd have recitals and probably do competitions.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And the little ones are the most fun to watch though in the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in the dancing and everything, that'd be a lotta fun.
L:  And then the parents can get they leotards from me! [LAUGH]
R:  There you go!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  See, you could open up the leotard store.
L:  Yeah, that's what I say, it'd be --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- everything in there.  You know, like costumes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Anything that the children, you know, the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, from birth to ten years old.
R:  Right.
L:  So that includes dancing school.
R:  Right.
L:  Gymnastics.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, the leotards.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Everything [several inaudible words] camp products.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, sewing --
R:  That'd be neat.
L:  -- pegs in the clothes.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]  That'd be neat. [LAUGH]  Let's see.  [SIGH]  What other kind of business would you open? [NOISE]
L:  Um --
R:  Have any other options?
L:  What about a restaurant?  'Cause I look at it like this --
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  -- people -- people are being born, people have to eat, and people will die.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, the cycle.
R:  They gotta eat.
L:  And they need clothes to wear.
R:  That's right.
L:  So like, in one of those -- in those f- four areas there's a big demand.
R:  That's good.
L:  You know. 
R:  That's really good.  What kinda restaurant would you open?
L:  Um --
R:  What kinda food would you want in it? [NOISE]
L:  Home cooking.
R:  Home cooking.
L:  Where you can relax.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The same type of cooking you would want --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in your house.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  And to relax --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [inaudible].  I'm not into that, uh --
R:  Relaxed atmosphere. [NOISE]
L:  Huh?
R:  You're all right, here you go.  [NOISE] [LAUGH]  My --
L:  I'm not into the uptight --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- high scale.
R:  Yeah, no suit and tie restaurant.
L:  You know, come to a restaurant, relax.  Enjoy your food.
R:  Right.
L:  If you wanna burp, you burp. [LAUGH]
R:  Kid friendly atmosphere.
L:  Yeah, you know.
R:  Yeah.  Where the waiters don't mind if your kids throw food on the floor --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- every now and then.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Let's see.
L:  Could you hold on for one second?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE] That's my cellphone ringing. [NOISE]  Hello? [NOISE]  Hi.  [NOISE]  Angie, [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I'm sorry.
R:  Okay, that's okay.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  That's no problem.
L:  Okay.  But that's the type of business that I would, um, that I would, um --
R:  Yeah, that'd be fun.
L:  You know --
R:  That'd be fun.
L:  -- something laid back.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, like how they y- -- like, you know, something you could be ca- -- if you wanna come dressed you could come dressed too.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  But it's a come as you are.
R:  Right.  That's a great idea.
L:  You know.  You know, if you --
R:  I know what other [NOISE] --
L:  Huh?
R:  I know what other type of business I would open.
L:  Like what?
R:  In my town.  Is [NOISE] some kind of children's museum --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and aquarium. [NOISE]  We don't --
L:  Yeah, that'd be nice.
R:  [NOISE] We don't have any of that in our town and --
L:  Where do you live at?
R:  [NOISE] In Indiana.
L:  Oh.
R:  [NOISE] Indiana, which --
L:  I'm in -- I'm in New York.
R:  [NOISE] Oh really?
L:  Manhattan.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well you guys got plenty of stuff to do --
L:  Yes, we do.
R:  -- there, don't ya! [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, we do.
R:  [LAUGH] So --
L:  Anything that matters and [MN] they have it.
R:  Yeah, I can imagine.
L:  Especially for kids.
R:  Yes.  We're kind of a small town --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- area.
L:  Mm.
R:  But we live in one -- around one larger town but it doesn't have anything like that, so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I think this area could really benefit from --
L:  Yep, like museums and --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- theater and arts and --
R:  Just the --
L:  -- and like you said --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- gymnastics and the --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- yoga.
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]  They need --
L:  You know.  Now I understand why [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, and I'm like -- I'm a person like that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, I think kids should be exposed to everything.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Like, my --
R:  Right.
L:  -- daughter's twenty eight years old, I'm like --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I have a granddaughter.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And like, she -- well, what it is, she's in Germany now.  She's been traveling.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  She's been to Paris and France and so she's getting that --
R:  That's great.
L:  -- education abroad.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, you haven't seen everything till you've seen the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- sights in New York.
R:  [NOISE] Yes.
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And New York has, you know, a l- lot --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to offer and is a very good place to open my business.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  [MN] The -- the main thing is location [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- location is -- lo- --
R:  So you would open your business in New York then? [NOISE]
L:  Yes I -- well --
R:  That'd be good.
L:  This -- I'm making -- I might relocate to Connecticut.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But Connecticut is a metropolis too, you know, they got --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- small towns too.
R:  Yes.
L:  But like, they -- you know, they have their little things --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- too, museums --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- uh, things for the kids.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know.  And the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- Li- -- you know, everything.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then I'm not -- won't be too far away from New York.
R:  [NOISE] That'd be good.
L:  You know.
R:  That'd be good. [NOISE]  Let's see, what else? [SIGH]  I would also [NOISE] -- I think that there would never be enough learning centers as far as --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- helping children [NOISE] who [NOISE] -- who are behind in school --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or, um --
L:  Like tutors.
R:  Yes, like a tutoring center.
L:  You know, after school center.
R:  Right.
L:  Homework clubs.
R:  Right.
L:  I was thinking on that too, like, I -- I would call it homework clubs.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But make it fun for them.
R:  Yeah.  Absolutely.
L:  Me and you on the same wavelength with the kids.
R:  Yes, definitely.
L:  [LAUGH] With the kids.
R:  I'm just -- I'm just in the second generation with them [LAUGH] and you're --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in the first! [LAUGH]
L:  With the kids.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I'm younger than your daughter. [LAUGH]
L:  Huh?
R:  I said, I'm younger than your daughter, so --
L:  Yeah? [LAUGH]
R:  I'm only twenty five.
L:  Yeah, but you're -- w- well, what you r- --
R:  And so --
L:  You're y- -- you're very mature.  I know some people older than my daughter, they not mature.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And don't have a good head on their shoulders.
R:  Oh, it's scary, isn't it?
L:  Yeah.  That's why I'd like to start with the k- --
R:  Some of those people are raising kids, that's even scarier.
L:  Uh, [MN] thank you.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And they're parents.  And I'm saying that's why I'd like to start with the kids, you know and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I -- I wanna do all -- everything with the kids.
R:  Yes, they need --
L:  Yeah.
R:  They need everybody on their side they can get.
L:  Because they're our future.
R:  That's right, that's absolutely right.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, they're so much fun.
L:  Yes, they are.
R:  Um, let's see.  I would probably [NOISE] also start some kind of center to help educate pregnant women.
L:  Oh that's -- that's good.
R:  Um, as far as even in [MN] -- well, different -- different childbirth options.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Different feeding options --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as far as breastfeeding or not and, um -- in our area we are big [MN] -- they're really big on formula.
L:  Oh.
R:  Formula feeding for -- 'cause this is -- it's a major producer of formula.
L:  Mm.
R:  And so [NOISE] --
L:  So a lot of the women don't breastfeed there?
R:  Right, right.  Very little actually, we --
L:  Wow, that's surprising.
R:  I know.  It's terrible.
L:  Mm.
R:  And I think -- I think that it should be known more or this area needs [NOISE] better education on it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  More public education on it.  Um, 'cause just recently Indiana finally passed a law that said
