R:  Hi, this is Amy.
L:  Hi, Amy, I'm Kristin.
R:  Hi. [LAUGH]
L:  This is a rough topic.
R:  It's weird. [LAUGH]
L:  It sounds like just something during our lifetime --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that we could change for our own life?
R:  Know what I'd like to do?
L:  What's that?
R:  Go back to [inaudible] and wilder days.
L:  Oh yeah?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So when w- -- when would that have been?
R:  I think eighteen hundreds.
L:  Oh okay.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I could see that.  I thought they meant with the topic that something in our lifetimes that we could've changed for ourselves but --
R:  Oh, I don't know.  Huh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I mean, is there anything during your lifetime you would've wanted to go back and change?
R:  High school.
L:  High school?  Was it -- was it real bad for ya?
R:  I would've tried harder.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I got Cs mostly.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  What would you do?
L:  Um, [SIGH] boy, probably -- probably like, I don't know, maybe junior high for me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I had like, really bad self esteem during that time.
R:  Oh.
L:  I was overweight then and, you know, a lotta kids picked on me and I think if I would've gotten more involved in sports or if I had gotten, you know, involved in playing an instrument or something like that, that would've really helped.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I guess that.  But as far as like, going back anywhere in time, boy, oh.  The thing is, I -- I like the -- the things that we have now, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- all the modern comforts.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'd be interested to see what it was like living back during some sort of times but I don't think I'd wanna -- to have all the inconveniences like no running water or no electricity.  I depend on -- no air conditioning, especially in this heat.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I would die, I don't think I could handle that.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, it would be hard.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I think they -- yeah, I -- I could see going back to the eighteen hundreds but, boy --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But they say too, I guess people who used to live back before a lotta these modern conveniences like air conditioning, they -- their bodies somehow got used --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know what I mean?  And even like, the Amish, who don't use any electricity, that they -- they never had it so they don't miss it.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  So even like with my son, he's -- he just turned a year --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I'm wondering if we should put air conditioning in his room right away or just let him go for a while because, you know, he's --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- never really experienced having air conditioning so it's not like he would miss it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I don't know.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Do you have any thoughts about that? [LAUGH]
R:  Well, it would be hard without air conditioning.
L:  Yeah.  W- what about the eighteen hundreds do you like, or what interests --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you about that time?
R:  All the food they had.
L:  Oh okay.
R:  [NOISE] Like maple syrup candy and ...
L:  Oh okay. [PAUSE]  Yeah, when I was little we used to make our own maple syrup.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Yeah, we lived, um, in a real rural part of Pennsylvania --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and we had all these maple trees and so we would tap 'em --
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH]
L:  -- and then we would collect all the -- all the sap and my dad had this huge iron container that he put the sap in and he'd cook it down, you know, outside for several hours, and then they'd pour it into these big pots and bring it in the house, and then mom would cook it down in the house, you know, until it was thick and syrupy.  And we used to do that every spring.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That'd be neat.
L:  You can't find any maple syrup like, at the store, that tastes anything like that.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  It's almost funny they call it maple syrup because it certainly doesn't taste like it's from maple trees.
R:  Well that's the only syrup I've ever had.
L:  Okay.
R:  The -- the store stuff.
L:  Yeah, well if you ever get to Vermont, you know, that's -- you can find a lot of maple from actual maple trees up there.
R:  I have been to that Vermont maple tree thing, um, that, I think it's Vermont Maple or something.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I'm gonna -- and I'm gonna go there when I get some money, and, uh, order some maple syrup candy.
L:  Oh yeah, that sounds good.  Well, maybe that's something you could do over the internet too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Although then you gotta pay shipping and sometimes that gets expensive.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] Oh, uh ... [LIPSMACK] --
L:  I guess I might be interested in -- in like, I don't know, some of the biblical times.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I'm -- I read the -- the stories with my daughter and think it'd be awfully cool to -- to go back and see what it would've been like, you know, with some of the -- the different big events that happened in --
R:  Meeting Jesus and --
L:  Yeah, oh absolutely.  Well, I expect to do that in the future so I'm looking --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- forward to that.
R:  Hopefully.  Huh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Someday.
L:  Yeah.  Um ...  but I -- we just finished, uh, reading about the flood and Noah and the ark and all that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know if wanted -- would've wanted to live through it but it would've been cool to be at --
R:  I wonder where that ark is?
L:  Oh, you know, I -- I just saw a documentary not too long ago that they have new satellite images that they think they can see like, the -- the shape of where it would be, in Turkey.
R:  Oh, Turkey?
L:  Yeah.  See, that's where Mount Ararat is.  And they've --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- had all these expeditions, going up and checking them and, you know, sometimes people thought they'd actually found it and they'd bring back samples and they'd do the carbon testing on 'em and it would turn out that, you know, the -- the dating was wrong and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you know, then they'd give up that site and -- and try another one.  But I guess here for a while because w- -- how'd this work out?  Something, I don't know if -- if the Soviet Union owned part of the mountain, that they would not allow, you know, certain images to be taken, or something like that, it was really funky about who owned the land and what they would and wouldn't allow to be checked out there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I don't know.  But I think one of these days -- I think one of these days they'll find it, especially with more and more technology they have --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, and they're -- they're able to do more with it and -- and I think if they ever get any kind of, uh, like, ground penetrating imagery, you know, that they can see below the surface somehow, 'cause they can't use any kinda heat imaging but, I don't know, something that they could see below the surface, then maybe they could get a better idea that -- if that is the site or not.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But it seems like all the time, like on the Discovery Channel they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- have shows about finding -- finding the lost ark and all that kinda stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] I don't know what else to talk about it. [LAUGH]
L:  I know, this is a hard subject.  The last one was about starting your own business and at least --
R:  oh.
L:  -- the man that I talked to, he had started his own so he was just telling me all about that. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But time travel, I don't know.
R:  Well I -- yesterday if I was there, I'd probably start my own Goodwill or something.
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't know.  Um, I've seen a lot of movies about time travel.  And the thing that I think is -- is really interesting is when they change one set of events, then how that totally affects the rest of history, it doesn't only affect --
R:  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  -- what they think it will, you know, but it -- it affects all kinda stuff.  Like, I used to like to watch Quantum Leap a lot --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and that was all about --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- going back in time.  And, of course, Back to the Future.  So I guess it's a popular -- a popular topic.
R:  I've seen -- I've seen Back to the Future.
L:  Uh-huh.  Did you ever watch Quantum Leap, it was a TV series on?
R:  Oh no.
L:  Back in the eighties I guess.  Yeah, and I catch reruns every once in a while.
R:  I've watched tho- that -- those, uh, [NOISE] I think it was, uh, [NOISE] spa- -- it was a time travel movie.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- uh, I forgot the name of it but [MN] [PAUSE] I forgot the name of it! [LAUGH]
L:  I guess Bill and Ted's Big Adventure was a -- [LAUGH] that was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- time travel. [SIGH]  But, I -- see, I don't think there's any part of my life that I would like to relive, I'm -- I'm pretty happy right where I am now, you know, I've got two kids and they're a blast and, you know, I've been married now for almost ten years.  I would never wanna go back to the dating scene.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know.
R:  Oh no.
L:  I'm so glad that's all done.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I wouldn't wanna go back to high school or college.  College was too much work, don't wanna go back to that, you know.  High school was too much worrying about what other people think and all the peer pressure --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and that kinda stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So -- and even my childhood, you know, the -- I -- I look back fondly on certain things but living in a real rural area we didn't have -- I didn't have any playmates --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that lived nearby.  Um, the closest girl that was within five years of my age was a mile away and so --
R:  Oh really?
L:  -- you know, it -- I used to play with -- but I had, you know, siblings, I had two brothers and a sister that were all older than me -- but I used to play -- we had cows and raccoons and pigs and I used to go out and play with them --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- out in the pasture and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- chase 'em around the fields ... and play in the --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- in the hay bale
