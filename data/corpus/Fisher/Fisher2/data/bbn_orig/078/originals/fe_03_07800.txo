L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  My name is Vanessa.
R:  Hi, Vanessa, I'm Pam.
L:  [NOISE] Hi, it's nice --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to meet you.
R:  Nice to meet you too, where are you from?
L:  Oklahoma.
R:  Oh yeah?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They're getting a lotta people from Oklahoma.
L:  Oh [LAUGH] really?  I think it's --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- all those referrals we were supposed --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to do.
R:  Yeah.  I think --
L:  W- --
R:  -- so too.
L:  Where are you from?
R:  Washington State.
L:  Oh, I've been there. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, we went on --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- vacation there several years ago.
R:  [NOISE] Oh did you?
L:  Yeah.  Um --
R:  So let's --
L:  Um, w- --
R:  -- see.  Hilariousness, huh, or humor --
L:  Oh, humor.
R:  -- huh?
L:  What's acceptable and unacceptable.  Gosh, I -- you know, [SIGH] --
R:  I think that depends on what your morals and ethics [NOISE] are.
L:  Yeah, definitely.  And -- and also, um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] --
R:  And the situation --
L:  -- what age k- --
R:  -- you're in.
L:  Yeah.  What age kids you've got, whether you're at work or --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know.  I mean, 'cause I hear stuff at work that, you know, I'd never hear at --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- home and I t- you know, I just try to ignore it, but, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't [SIGH] -- uh, and there's all s- -- there's all sorts of different ranges of humor.  I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- stuff that I would probably not consider too off color my mother would consider real off color so, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I -- I don't know, I [SIGH] -- I don't like really dirty jokes --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but that's just my pers- --
R:  I don't either.
L:  -- that's my personal preference.  Um, [LIPSMACK] and I don't like -- I don't like ethnic jokes.  Um, but, uh [MN], uh, I think that, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- probably -- well, it's just like my husband sometimes he'll come home and he'll say, "Do you wanna hear a joke?" and I'll say, "Not if you heard it at work" because you don't hear clean jokes where he works.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But, um --
R:  I don't know very many places you do. [LAUGH]
L:  No.
R:  [inaudible] --
L:  No, well --
R:  Except for like, church. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah! [LAUGH]  Yeah, we've got --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- uh, um -- our --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- the pastor at our church that takes up the offering, um, he always tells a joke.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  So -- and his are always good.  But, um, yeah, I'm -- I -- I -- e- especially, you know, with -- like I said, my -- my husband is a, um, he works for the City and, uh, so he [LAUGH] -- h- he works with a lotta different people that, you know, that, uh, sick humor is most of what he gets but, I don't think it's appropriate for, um, for where I work, which is -- I work with a bunch of former teachers so, um, we, you know, i- a whole different category but -- but I still, uh, I don't think it's, uh, I don't think it's appropriate.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Uh, of course it's all guys where he works and we have a mixture, and I think that -- uh, I mean, don't you think that makes a difference?
R:  Yeah, I, um, humor is supposed to be something that's fun and enjoyable.
L:  Right.
R:  And [NOISE] to be fun an enjoyable that means it's something that can't be slandering or -- or [NOISE] something that can be, uh, [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- rude or gross or --
L:  Offe- yeah, offensive or hurtful.
R:  Offensive.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, I know --
R:  But most jokes fit that category.
L:  [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Whether --
L:  Not -- yeah.
R:  -- in their workplace [NOISE] -- in the male workforce. [NOISE]
L:  [LIPSMACK] Right.  And -- and it's like, um, it's like the difference between comedy now and comedy even --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, twenty years ago, um, like, Carol Burnett comedy and [LAUGH] -- and the, you know, Comedy Central comedy is just --
R:  Well they did ethnic jokes and so on.  I think it's how you use it or how touchy you are to it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't mind ethnic jokes, as long as they're done in good taste.  [NOISE]
L:  Well --
R:  With --
L:  And, you know --
R:  And you're -- you're poking fun at yourself. [NOISE]
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  If you're pok- -- I don't like when you're slandering someone else.
L:  Right.
R:  Or you're slandering a group of people -- slow down, Tony -- [NOISE], um, [NOISE] you know, that kind of thing.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, if you're poking yourself, that's a whole nother story, but --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- if you're fitting it in a group of people [NOISE] and one of 'em could be that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- then it can be misinterpreted.
L:  Right.
R:  And it can actually hurt their feelings and it --
L:  Oh, well --
R:  -- it's just not nice.
L:  No.  Yeah, I agree with you wholeheartedly.
R:  It's not very sensitive.
L:  No.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um --
R:  So, --
L:  It --
R:  I [NOISE] -- I [LAUGH] -- I think it just depends on, um, [NOISE] for me I just -- I -- I try -- I [NOISE] -- I try to poke more fun at me and stay within the boundaries of myself than go beyond that because ... I -- I -- I don't wanna slander people and -- and because of my Christian background [NOISE], um, I wanna be careful on what words I'm using --
L:  Right --
R:  -- because they can come back at you.
L:  -- you gon- -- wanna be a good witness, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, yeah, and that's, you know, I -- I know, um, I've got teenage kids and -- and they come home and [LAUGH] -- and tell me things that, you know, it's like, "Should you really be saying stuff like or listening to stuff like that at school?" and -- and it's just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's just no big deal to them.  [LIPSMACK] --
R:  I know.
L:  Uh, you know, they -- they hear it all the time.  So --
R:  Well, you get numb from it.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
R:  It's even like us with movies.  I mean, look at the cussing and so on that's going on now.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Or even the -- the jokes that are going on now.  They're, um [NOISE] in movies and so on.  They're, uh, they're getting worse and worse yet they're rated PG.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, look at the cuss words, you know.
L:  [NOISE] Well, [MN] --
R:  What they consider funny.
L:  And -- and it's like the base humor, I just -- that -- I -- I just can't stand that, you know, I [MN], um, there's just some stuff that, you know, I -- there's some stuff just stupid, it's not funny.
R:  No.
L:  And I think that -- that kids nowaday- you know, they, um, they think -- and -- and [MN] --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- even adults, you know, they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just think it's -- it's really funny and I just don't find anything humorous about someone, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- skateboarding off a roof and -- and breaking a leg, you know?
R:  Yeah, I think --
L:  And that's --
R:  -- it's stupid.
L:  Right, right, you know.  I like the old, um, I mean, I -- I grew up watching Laurel and Hardy and -- and --
R:  [MN] That's my husband's thing.
L:  Yeah, you know.  I love humor like that, I like slapstick comedy, but --
R:  But see, then they -- y- people back then -- you [inaudible] whacking people back and forth, now it's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- considered abuse.
L:  Right.
R:  So ...
L:  [SIGH] Right, but you know --
R:  -- you gotta be sensitive there.
L:  Right.  But you know, even back then it was -- y- you knew nobody was really getting hurt, you know?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It was just all visual, but --
R:  But nowadays they don't.
L:  Yeah.  Well [MN] --
R:  Look what they do, they actually acci- -- I mean, kids are --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- becoming more and more violent.
L:  Yeah, like that, um --
R:  So the humor is being --
L:  Like -- like --
R:  -- distorted.
L:  -- the -- the Jackass movie.  I mean I --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- wouldn't let my kids go see it, it was like, "You know, that's not funny, that's just stupid and somebody's gonna get hurt because they've gone to watch that".
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, you know, that's -- I mean --
R:  And the name of it isn't much better --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because there's nothing to do with that, so --
L:  Well, yeah, idiot is more like it.  But see, that's -- and I think that's just it, you know, humor today is -- is completely different than what it was.  Um, I -- i- it's -- I think it's --
R:  There was more innocence there, in the past.
L:  [SIGH] It's -- it's gotten violent, just like a lot of other things, the jokes and -- and just the, you know.
R:  And sexual. [NOISE]
L:  Right.  Right.  And but [MN] --
R:  Everything, and sex sells. [NOISE]
L:  Well, and you know, b- uh, [SIGH] years and years ago, um, a- and there -- there's always --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- been off color comics, um, Marty Allan, uh, people like that.
R:  I'll drop you guys off and you guys still sign in.
L:  They're, you know, back in -- in -- I know, m- my dad used to, you know, comment about different, uh, comedians that he would tell me, you know, "They might be funny on TV but I've seen them, you know --"
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  "-- in -- in clubs or whatever and they're not funny".
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, "They're just disgusting and -- and vile".  So I think it's all -- I think it's been there --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but now it's just --
R:  Hurry!
L:  -- it's -- it's so open.
R:  I agree.  [NOISE]
L:  But -- but as far as, you know, I guess as far as -- as the -- the jokes and stuff at w- -- at work, um, and, you know, it -- wherever you are, I -- I prefer a funny joke as opposed to something that's, you know, uh, th- and you don't hear -- you don't hear a lot of really funny jokes anymore, um --
R:  No.
L:  -- so -- I -- I hear --
R:  They're more -- they're more +innuendos --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or there -- there's another meaning behind 'em.  There's -- they're more derogatory or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- there's some kind of slam somewhere in it.
L:  Yeah.  And, uh, it's just, you know, I don't --
R:  It's not innocent.
L:  No.  Yeah, and -- and --
R:  And fun.
L:  You're -- you're absolutely right, it's just -- it's lost its innocence and -- and, um, just, you know, humor has a different -- has a different definition now than what it used to.  So, uh, I think i- --
R:  Definitely not nice.
L:  Yeah.  And it -- it's so sad, um, because there's still funny stuff out there, you know, things that -- th- it can be fun and funny, um, without being disgusting and, um, I think they do it more for shock, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, I n- --
R:  You think so?
L:  Oh yeah.  Sh- it's the shock value.  I mean, I think that's the reason why they -- they do the, you know, the movies and they're supposed to be comedies but, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the -- I, you know, like I said, they're d- -- they're not funny to me, they're stupid, and it is for shock.  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And so it's just, you know, I mean, [SIGH] it -- it [SIGH] just makes you wonder what kinda, uh ... what kinda person sits around--
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and thinks up that kind of stuff, you know?
R:  [NOISE] I don't know [SIGH] y- I think you see it, hear it, between the radios and
