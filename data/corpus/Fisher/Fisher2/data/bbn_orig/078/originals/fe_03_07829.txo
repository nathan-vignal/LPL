R:  Hi there, Margaret from Santa [inaudible].
L:  Hi, I'm Farrah from Gainsville, Florida.
R:  Oh wow!  You're clear across.  I talked to a lady in Nova Scotia the other day.
L:  Oh cool.
R:  Yeah, would you take a mill to leave the United States?
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  You would?  Where would you go?
L:  I'd go to like, En- Great Britain or Italy or Spain, somewhere in Western Europe.
R:  Yep, that sounds like a good thing to me.
L:  Yeah.  And the thing about never returning would be fine because I'd have enough money, I'd like, designate some of that money for my family to take trips over for the rest of their lives.
R:  There ya go. [MN]
L:  That's like, the only thing that would hold me back, would be my family, but if I had enough -- that much money, I could just [LIPSMACK] send it --
R:  You could just go with it and run, huh?
L:  Well yeah, and I could afford to buy my family tickets to come see me.
R:  There you go.  I would do it in a heartbeat.
L:  Yeah.
R:  In -- in a half of a heartbeat.  And I'd like to go to Germany or Switzerland or something like that.  I have relatives that live back there.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That's what I would do.  And I would miss a lot about the United States, especially Oregon --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it's so green and, you know, we have the coast and the ...
L:  Yeah, I love Oregon, I've been to Portland.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I live about an hour south of there.
L:  Oh, Portland's great, I'm planning on living out there actually.
R:  Oh cool!
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  Cool.
L:  I used to live in Seattle.
R:  Uh-huh, Seattle's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- cool too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But we're getting off the subject here. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's what they're probably studying.
R:  [LAUGH] I'm sure it is.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I would, yeah, I'd do it in a heartbeat and I would miss Oregon and I would not miss our problems with our government.
L:  Right.
R:  I'm --
L:  I wouldn't miss that either.
R:  I'm really disgusted about -- you know, and especially here in Oregon we have all the school funding issues and our economy's really bad and stuff.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, but yeah, I would definitely go to Switzerland or Germany.  I'd like to tour like, England, like the castles and stuff.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Wouldn't that be cool?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think it's be way cool.
L:  Yeah.  I wish that we had more history, like, the history of Europe is just so much richer.
R:  It's true.
L:  Because there's, you know, it's just hundreds --
R:  They've been around for so much longer.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  But their -- their cultures and stuff are a lot more different than ours are, they're a lot more accepting of the way people are and the way they live and stuff than we are in the United States too.
L:  Yeah, I think they're much looser on the gay thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Which would be nice for me.
R:  Yeah, and, um, they don't judge people, th- their -- a person's worth is not judged by what they do, just that they do something.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Ri- you know, like a CEO in -- in America gets judged a lot better than somebody that digs ditches and stuff.
L:  Right.
R:  So -- I didn't know about the gay thing too much over there, I don't follow that too much over there in Europe.
L:  [LIPSMACK] I mean, I could be wrong but I think it th- -- but th- then again, like, here, it just depends on where you live.
R:  That's true.
L:  You know.  Portland's very ...
R:  Portland's very liberated when it comes to that.
L:  Right.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ...
R:  [MN] Very much so.  Very --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- very much so.  What else would you miss?  Would you miss --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Florida as a whole?
L:  No, I'm ready to leave Florida.  I would never --
R:  How long have you been there then?
L:  My whole life basically.  I -- I've just spent -- I spent like, three years on the west coast and I loved it out there but it was when I was, um, a teenager.
R:  Ah.
L:  So I was living with my family.
R:  Ah.
L:  But there is nothing I would miss in Florida.
R:  I've always wanted to visit Florida.  My friend, Liz's, uh, son and daughter in law just moved there, down by Walt Disney World I think.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I -- I don't have a clue why they moved there. [LAUGH]
L:  It's horrible.
R:  Is it?
L:  I don't like it but, you know, some people do so I guess that's ... not fair.
R:  Well, would it -- and it seems to me there's a lotta old people down there too.
L:  I just, you know, s- -- I kn- -- I know some people who like the weather.  I don't really understand how you can like living without seasons --
R:  Yuk!
L:  With, like, ninety degrees all year long --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and the humidity at a hundred percent.  But some people like that, I don't get it.
R:  Ugh!  Ew!
L:  Yeah, so I would not miss Florida, I would not miss American culture.  I would not miss the food, American food, would not miss it. [LAUGH]  I really c- --
R:  I wouldn't either.
L:  Yeah, I really can't [NOISE] think of one thing that I'd miss, which is kinda sad.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And the only thing I'd miss is my family but I'd f- -- I'd just fly 'em over.
R:  You'd have means to get them there.
L:  Yeah.  So --
R:  And a million, I don't know how much a million would last in any other country.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  I don't care, it's a million --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- more than I have now!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'd just get a job at the country, you know what I mean?
R:  Yeah [LAUGH]!
L:  It's not like I would ...
R:  You got a good attitude about it! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it's not like I would ... never work again, I'm not looking --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- at that, it's just ...
R:  I've always wondered as Americans, if we went over there with a whole bunch of money or not, how they would look at us, just being Americans --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- because our cultures are so different.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I wondered if they'd be down on us or accept --
L:  It's just how you act, honestly.  If you act --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- obnoxious people are gonna see you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- as that.
R:  No matter what country you're from, huh?
L:  Right.
R:  Right.
L:  But if you are down to earth ...
R:  Mhm. [MN]
L:  That's all that counts.  And also it depends on where you go.  If you went to y- Brazil, you could living amazing on a million dollars.
R:  That's true.  In Mexico you can live on five bucks a day.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so it'd --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- last you forever and then some.
L: Yeah.
R:  That's very true.
L:  So it really just depends.  I mean, you go to western Europe it's gonna be -- the cost of living is going to be similar to here.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Uh, yeah, I would imagine.  Spain, Great Britain --
R:  So, you sound like you've been, have you ever been?
L:  Yeah, I've been to, um, London.
R:  Oh cool!
L:  And France and Belgium.
R:  Oh wow!
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've been to Canada. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Now, I don't know --
L:  I've been --
R:  I don't know if I'd go to Canada with a million dollars.
L:  I've --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- actually been to, uh, Mexico as well.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, you can live cheap down there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't think I'd go to Canada though, 'cause I think --
L:  Why?
R:  -- they'd want all my money.
L:  What do you mean?
R:  Because I hear that they're money hungry up there, their economy -- their, uh, inflation's like really worse than ours.
L:  Yeah, but they take care of you.
R:  That's true, they do.
L:  You get healthcare, you get a lotta things --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- for that money.
R:  Yeah, that's true.  If you were a citizen or not probably, with all that money, huh?
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I think what I would really, really, really like to do is just go on a tour of all of Europe.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know.  And see Italy and France and, you know, go to all the, uh, like, I really wanna see Amsterdam, I hear a lot about Amsterdam, I'd really like to go there.
L:  They say it's the cheapest place to fly into it.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Huh.  Well that's interesting to know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Me and a group of my friends wanna go really bad.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Maybe someday. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'd have to get my million first.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now, do you guys have a lottery down there, where you could win a mill?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do ya?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  We do too.  Ours is up to almost a hundred million.
L:  Wow.  I don't really play.
R:  I don't either.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So I guess I'm not gonna win anything.
R:  Uh, it's like, a -- a d- -- I weigh it out, food or lottery ticket? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I gotta eat.  [inaudible] --
L:  Hey, how did you find out about this study?
R:  Um, my neighbor, John, told me.  I'm in a --
L:  Have you -- sorry, go ahead.
R:  I'm an apartment manager at a really small apartment complex.
L:  Uh-huh. [SIGH]
R:  And my neighbor told me about it.  How he found about it, I think it was through a friend of his.
L:  Yeah, that's how I found out.  Have you received money yet?
R:  Not yet, this is only my second call.
L:  Oh, this is my third.
R:  Ah.  So --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- yeah, af- after your third I think you get it in a couple of weeks is what, uh, my neighbor's friend, he got his in a couple of weeks.
L:  Oh cool.
R:  Yeah.  So that'd be cool.  It's a good way to make some extra bucks.
L:  It's fun too if you don't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- mind talking to people.
R:  It is really fun and I really enjoy talking to somebody on the east coast and like I said, that lady from Nova Scotia.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That was really interesting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And we get the subject, sports on TV.
L:  Oh.
R:  Well I don't watch sports. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I don't either.  I don't even have TV.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Right.
R:  Wow, you're one of the few.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I don't have time.
R:  I just -- I work out of my home so that's -- so I have to stay home all the day.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So it's all I got to do.  Well, I do a lotta gardening too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's another thing, I'd like to go to London because I know they have wonderful gardens over there.  Did you see any of those?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah [NOISE], we definitely toured the gardens.
R:  Cool.  That's what I would really like to see, is how they do their gar- --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- 'cause I'm a huge gardener, I have my whole apartment complex I take care of.
L:  Oh yeah?
R:  Yeah.  It's only sixteen units but still, it's big enough for one person.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...  Where else is there?  Central America would be cool.
L:  Yeah, I'm [MN] trying to plan on going to Brazil.
R:  That'd be cool.
L:  Um --
R:  I have a friend that moved down there years ago.
L:  Really?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That's cool.  Yeah, my girlfriend is from there.
R:  Oh!
L:  So we're gonna try, as soon as she graduates, to move there for however long our money lasts.
R:  [LAUGH] There you have it! [LAUGH]
L:  You know.
R:  So, yeah.
L:  Now's the time.
R:  Yeah it is.
L:  We're not gonna --
R:  I hear the economies down there is really good and --
L:  Really?
R:  That's what I hear.  I don't know if it's --
L:  Well they got a new good president.
R:  Uh.
L:  So that might be it, but -- you know, she has family there so ...
R:  Oh, you'll have places to go and stay and they could show ya all around.
L:  Yeah.  And since she speaks the language it's gonna make it easier.
R:  Oh yeah, most --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- definit- -- well that's another thing I never thought of, is going to travel, a language barrier.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I never thought of that before.
L:  Mm.
R:  Now what about Japan or China, you have any interests in seeing the orient?
L:  I have interest because I love sushi! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I wouldn't mind eating sushi every day for the rest of my life but, uh --
R:  So that'd be -- that'd be kinda cool.
L:  Yeah, but -- and I -- yeah, I'd like to go to Japan.  Honestly, for some reason I have no interest in China but, yeah.
R:  Well, they're kinda communistic back there too anyway.
L:  Yeah.  That doesn't bother me but I have no interest, I don't know why.
