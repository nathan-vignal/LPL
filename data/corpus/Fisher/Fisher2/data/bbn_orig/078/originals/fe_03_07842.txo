L:  Marsha.
R:  Hi, I'm Rachel.
L:  Hey, Rachel.
R:  It's nice to meet you, I'm from --
L:  Nice to meet you. [NOISE]
R:  I'm from Georgia. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, well we're not too far, we're from Florida, north Florida.
R:  Oh wow. [LAUGH]
L:  Near Talahafi[?].
R:  That's interesting, I -- I spoke with a lady from Canada one day actually.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  But, uh, I haven't spoken with anyone that -- that was, uh, close to me, uh --
L:  Oh wow.  What -- what part of Georgia you in? [NOISE]
R:  Um, I'm in Dalton.
L:  Oh okay.
R:  We're the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- carpet capital of the world apparently.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I guess we need to talk about our topic, huh?
R:  Yes.  Uh --
L:  One million dollars to leave the country.
R:  And when I first heard that I was thinking, well that's interesting, but then they put in that little catch, and never return.
L:  Right.
R:  And -- and that kinda made me a little --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- leery I would I have to say because I have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so many friends and family --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- here that it would just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- be devastating to not be --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- able to return.
L:  Right, right.  I do- -- I don't --
R:  So --
L:  -- think I could do it either. [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I -- I don't think I would want to -- to leave and never return.  I [NOISE] -- I don't agree with everything America does but I don't wanna go to another country and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and get in the worse shape than we're in --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in America. [LAUGH]  And money's just not worth it.
R:  Yeah.  And, I mean, you would be leaving so much behind when you think about it.  Your job, you'd have to get set up with a new job out there and, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just -- depending on what country you chose, it could be, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, real -- real adaptation would be involved --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean, learning new languages and, uh --
L:  Right.
R:  -- all the customs. [LAUGH]  And --
L:  Right.  And i- --
R:  Um, [MN] if --
L:  That would be hard.
R:  If I were to go I would probably have to select a country, maybe like Australia.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I know I have some friends over there that I talk to on the internet --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, uh, I -- I'd say they're -- they're probably more similar to us than -- than most, uh --
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I --
R:  -- most cultures. [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, uh, I know even, uh, even --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the people I talk to, like the US rock bands and everything will come over there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and do shows, so, uh --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  -- [MN] so you'd get a -- still get a little bit of your -- your, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I guess US flavor over there, but --
L:  Right.  Well --
R:  There would also be considerable -- considerable things to get used to as well. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right.
R:  [MN]
L:  Yeah, yeah, there -- yeah, if -- if there was a lot of American interest overseas in that area, yeah, I guess, you know, I could deal with it, but I don't think I'd want to.  But, 'cause --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you know, after a while a million dollars is gonna run out.
R:  Yeah, that's for sure.
L:  You know.  Especially, you know, we're young, a million dollars is gonna run out and -- and what's the -- what's the -- the money exchange too, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  That -- that would take in -- into effect.
R:  That would definitely factor in.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, uh, yeah, offhand it sounds like, wow, a lot of money, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, i- I don't know, then you start to think about what's really important to you and I would have to say that -- that leaving everybody here and not being able to come back would be just devastating.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, because, I mean, that -- that's something that really matters.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, [SIGH] but --
L:  Right.
R:  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  But, I -- y- I -- I would think maybe I would -- England would be a good place too, possibly, because they've got pretty good democracy and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they're -- they've got the law enforcement and they keep up with that kinda stuff, so that would possibly be a -- but I don't think I'd wanna live and stay there forever.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  That would just -- I mean, [MN] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Like I said, a million dollars would run out real fast and then you never see your family again and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't know, it's just not -- not something I would do.
R:  Yep. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  The, uh, ten minutes is long, isn't it? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, it depends on what topic you get, um, have you done these before?
L:  This is my second one.
R:  Your second one.
L:  We've had calls but -- now, my husband has done some.  Um, but this is only my second one, so I, um, and I -- I -- I just -- I haven't gotten used to it yet I guess! [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I find it real interesting and it does depend on what topic.  Um, this is the -- the, uh, third call that I've --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I've actually accepted, um, there were a couple that were just topics that I just had no +idea --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- on how I would begin to talk about.  One was, um, uh, one was about athletics and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- uh, [LIPSMACK] and some financial aspect of that, and I just -- that was just a little -- a little too much, but, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I- it d- -- I had a topic about the internet and education and we just, we were just going on about that but --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- but this posed a lotta questions, if you were interested in doing it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- however, if -- if it was something that -- that you weren't interested in, it was -- there -- there weren't a lotta -- I guess there wasn't as much to say about it. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right.
R:  But, [MN] --
L:  Right.  I wonder what the school systems would be like overseas too?
R:  Yeah, well, it's -- it's real interesting.  I mentioned the rock music thing because I did a study when I was in college --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, about -- about music in the Australian culture, and like I said, I had friends over there and -- and it's real interesting to see the little differences.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, just like how it's acceptable to behave, um, apparently shows are a lot more mild over there and they don't go wild and they don't scream and yell like we do in the US --
L:  Oh wow, yeah.
R:  -- and, uh, and, uh, it was just interesting, um, to see all the -- all the different aspects, little things that you don't really think about that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that, uh, that make a difference.
L:  Right.
R:  And, uh, I mean, just like our gestures, you know, uh, all sorts of things.
L:  Right.
R:  You would have to get used to so you didn't offend anyone.
L:  Yes, yes.
R:  And, uh, i- it would definitely take so much getting used to --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to live in -- in some other [MN] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, even -- even those nations similar to us, I mean --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's just -- [SIGH] [MN].
L:  And yeah, and I've got three children so they would have a big culture shock and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- have to learn to -- to redo that kinda stuff and ...
R:  Yeah, when you think about moving a whole family, that's even more.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yes, I -- you know, I couldn't ask my family -- I couldn't ask my kids to do that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't think.  So that -- that would -- that would take in another factor as to why not to do it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- also.
R:  It would definitely be an interesting experience if it -- if the question were posed as --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to if you would do it for a year or --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- something.
L:  Right.
R:  That -- that would definitely have a different effect but I -- I was thinking about it and considering it until I heard that never come back --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- part and then --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I was like [LIPSMACK] --
L:  When I heard that I thought, no --
R:  -- no, no, no [LAUGH].
L:  -- never come back, no.  A year, okay, I could --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I -- I'd give it a try.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  For a year. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But after that, no, I -- I don't think I'd wanna be away that long.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Too -- terribly long.  So that's something -- gosh, they -- they got some good questions though.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
L:  They -- I don't -- how long do they do this?  I mean, how long are they gonna be doing this study, do you know?
R:  I'm really not sure.  Um, I've -- I've --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- set up one hour, um, at the end of my office day, from six to seven, and I always --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- get my calls in between there --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, before I leave for the day, but I -- I don't know how long they're gonna keep calling us, uh --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- I haven't heard anything about that, so [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.  'Cause I've g- -- I -- I, uh, got online through the, uh, got it through the internet.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's how I learned it -- about it.
R:  Yeah, that's how I found out as well, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- someone had emailed me --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and told me that they were doing this study, so --
L:  [NOISE] Oh, okay, I got it from some friends on the internet [NOISE] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- this group that I'm in, we have some -- so that's how I got it, but [NOISE] now, did you give your social security number?
R:  Um, I believe that I did.
L:  Yeah, because I'm hearing now that you have to have your social security number so ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  I ha- -- I didn't give mine 'cause at first it didn't say you had to have it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So I've got to call that in and get it to 'em so I will -- we can get paid.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, it's been really interesting just -- just talking to people and I was real surprised at -- when I spoke with the -- the lady from Canada because I didn't know it was an international kinda thing --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so they're really -- they're really broadening -- broadening their --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- horizons I guess and --
L:  Mhm, they sure are.
R:  -- and, uh --
L:  They are.
R:  [MN]
L:  But it's [NOISE] -- it's -- it's really [inaudible] -- I'd like to hear some of the other conversations is what they brought up [NOISE] -- my husband's had some good conversations. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I s- -- I certainly hope they do a little follow up 'cause I'm a little curious as to what they -- they're --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- what they're wanting to know, I -- and research studies are always interesting to me --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so I'd -- I --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I wonder if they'll let us know after -- after the fact what -- what was going on --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and what they were looking for and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- looking at.
L:  And most of the time my husband's been set up with a man too, I think all --
R:  Oh really?
L:  -- all three of his have been, excuse me, a man.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, yeah, they said that they were trying to find more gentlemen because they didn't have as many, um --
L:  Right.
R:  A- and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- everyone I spoke to, I -- I only spoke with females when -- when --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- when, uh, when I've -- I got r- -- uh! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm having trouble talking!  When I received --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the calls I've only had females on the other end --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And today, um, I thought they were never gonna conne- connect, I was on the phone for like, ten minutes.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  So I guess nobody wanted to talk about --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- about this.  It m- -- it must have been.
L:  Yeah, my husband got one this afternoon but he couldn't take it, he wasn't --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- home to take it and I was debating if I should take it or not and I thought, well, just in case they have his name under it I'd better not, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I went ahead and hung up and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I got a [inaudible] time 'cause of work now, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh, yeah.  But it m- like, you know, [SIGH] we've talked about spending the lottery money, you know, when we -- when we wanna spend the lottery -- we can spend that all different ways.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And we've never talked about going overseas with the, uh, you know, if we won the lottery.
R:  Yeah, I've -- I've actually never been overseas.  Now, I know a lotta people who are very interested in -- in the international travel and I guess they would be more receptive to maybe this kinda thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Especially if it's somewhere they've been or, um, [MN] -- I don't know, with some people I -- I would say have a real strong tie to a country because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they heard it
