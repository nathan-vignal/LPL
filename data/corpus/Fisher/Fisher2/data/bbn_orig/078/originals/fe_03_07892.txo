L:  Hello, my name is Amanda.
R:  Hi Amanda --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm Susan.
L:  Hi Susan.
R:  Hi.
L:  Okay, so, here we go.  Have you done this before? 
R:  I have not.
L:  Okay [LAUGH], I've --
R:  Have you?
L:  -- only done it once before, so --
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- we just talk for ten minutes on the topic.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um --
R:  I'm all set -- so, what do you think?
L:  I don't think I could do it [LAUGH] -- I depend on my best friend way too much.
R:  Yeah.
L:  For an ear, for a helping hand, [NOISE] for everything, and [SIGH], um -- ah, if she wasn't in my life, it -- it would be [NOISE] a pretty sad and dreary life -- I don't think that money could replace her.  [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah, oh, that's very nice.  Now, how do you feel -- what if, um -- how would you feel about lying to your benefactor and saying, "Oh, yes, I'll do it", and then you go back?
L:  Um ...
R:  I mean, what if you had contact with your best friend [MN], and --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- accepting the money -- would you be able to do that?
L:  [MN] If I knew I wasn't going to get caught?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's good isn't it?
L:  [LAUGH] Maybe.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  What about you -- would you take money to not speak to your best friend?
R:  To not speak to my best friend -- does that mean we can still kind of be friends and communicate?  I mean, that's really difficult isn't it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I guess, you -- you really, really have to weigh it out, I mean, I've lost best friends over [SIGH] really silly things, you know, like boyfriends, and, you know, when one of you moves away -- it's just not the same.  So, I don't know, I'm thinking maybe I could, but, then ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's really, really difficult, isn't it?
L:  It is, um, I mean, I'd love the money, of course --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- I mean, you know, no doubt about that, but, [SIGH] oh, I don't know, I've been best friends with the same person for -- oh, since I was eight.
R:  Is that right?  How old are you now?
L:  And, I'm twenty eight, so --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- [MN] twenty seven -- I forget how old I am.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my goodness, you've been friends for a long time.
L:  [LAUGH] I'm sorry?
R:  You've been friends for a long time.
L:  Yeah, and we were --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- and we were, I mean, we even live in different states --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, so -- but, we've just -- we've never lost contact and that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- no matter how far we are, and [SIGH] she was my maid of honor in my wedding, and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] you know, just -- we see each other often, so, yeah, I -- I couldn't do it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I couldn't do it.  Unless of course I wasn't going to get caught, then, yeah, I'd probably take the money.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  How horrible is that?  [LAUGH]
R:  N- n- no, well, I don't know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I mean, I suppose -- I don't know what they're looking for in this survey, but -- or, they -- this --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- topic, but, [SIGH] you know, I -- I kind of feel that way as well, but, then there's the back and forth you could go, you know -- could I do this, and could I do that?  I mean, would I not get caught?  You never know.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  I guess it also depended, like, if it was, you know -- you just can't ever talk to her on the phone anymore, or --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- would you have to drop your friend completely [SIGH]?
R:  And, part of what I'm thinking as well, is -- have you read those stories where, oh, you know, the man -- the man sells his best silver -- best silver something and he buys his wife a hair -- a h- -- a beautiful hair clip -- well, she ends up cutting off her hair to buy him what he wanted -- do you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- do you see what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, what if the anonymous benefactor said, "Okay, would you [MN] -- if I was to give you a million dollars, would you never speak to your best friend again?", and you were to say, [SIGH] "No, I certainly could not do that", he'd say, "Yep, you're the -- exactly the kind of person I'm looking for".
L:  Yeah, and that would be awesome.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm, and then on the other hand if you said, "Yes", then maybe it's like, "Oh well, you know, this is just a test to see how -- what kind of a person you are" -- 'cause it's [MN] -- the anonymous person -- I wonder who that would be?  Maybe it's your best friend.
L:  Oh, that's --
R:  What about that?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause it's anonymous right?
L:  What about that -- I didn't think about that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It'd be like, the ultimate test.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I think I'd pass.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I'm sure you would.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know about me though -- we've just recently moved to a different city and I'm kind of, just on my own, so, [SIGH] I guess I've got a bit -- a bit of a cynical view.
L:  Oh, I can understand that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I actually just moved to another city, too.  [SIGH] 
R:  Oh, gee.
L:  Very small ci- -- I moved from New York city to a very small city, so ...
R:  Oh, jeeze, I did similar, I mean, not as big as New York, New York is huge --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, it does give you a different, you know, I really, really miss my friends and family now, whereas, before you kind of take them for granted.
L:  Yeah, yeah ... well, then again I don't know.  I don't really miss my friends from New York too much, but I do miss, um, companionship.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] But, [SIGH] I have friends, you know, in other -- I don't know, it seems like all of my friends have just kind of -- after college, we all kind of split up in different directions anyway, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, I -- I just -- I still value those friendships --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- but, with my best friend -- yeah, she's -- I mean, if she were a man I would of married her.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm, yeah, I had a friend like that as well, and what happened?  She ended up moving away, and she was [MN] -- she was a person that I just miss, I really, really, really miss her, and I did end up calling her, you know, we've been just kind of out touch for a few years, you know, maybe at least five --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I thought, "You know, I really, really wonder what happened, you know?  How did we just drift apart like that?", and I called her, and she was just her normal self on the phone, you know, but, again, it was just different because of the time.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  The -- um, and -- so, you're still not in contact?
R:  Well, I did con- -- I did contact her after we moved to this small city and I was feeling very sorry for myself, and I thought "I need contact -- I really wonder what happened to her".
L:  [SIGH] But, I mean, have you talked to her since that one time?
R:  No, no --
L:  No.
R:  -- we said, "Well, you know, we'll have to exchange cards --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- and you'll have to call me --"
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  "-- we'll get a better calling plan" --
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- you know how that is -- everybody --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yes, yes, yes.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, we can never lose touch -- it's like when you quit a job, everybody says, [SIGH] "Make sure you stay in touch".
L:  Yeah, and you never do.
R:  No.
L:  Never [inaudible].
R:  And I -- I've kind of been through that so many times.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't -- you know ...
L:  Oh.  [SIGH] Well --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I d- -- I don't think you're a bad person if you were to take the money.  Just so you know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH] Well, that's nice of you.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean, right now I don't, um -- I don't know if I could, I mean, I've got a very, very guilty conscience as well, so [MN] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, plus, you know, my mind probably works exactly the same way, that is, I think about everything, you know, like, "What if this, and what if that?".
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause, you know, what if it was a test?  What if it was the test?
L:  [SIGH] And, it -- it probably is a test in a [inaudible], you know, driven world, I mean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it -- it probably is, like, [SIGH] but, [SIGH] I -- I think it depends, I mean, it depends on how close you are with your best friend -- is she or he really your best friend --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or, just someone that you've been, like, friends with for a long time, I mean --
R:  Yes, it --
L:  -- I -- I -- 
R:  -- does depend on the degree --
L:  -- you know?
R:  -- and what you've been through together as well.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Exactly.  'Cause I mean, I would weigh those things, you know?  [MN] W- with my best friend, it just happens to be that, you know, she's kind of like my [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- twin.
R:  Yep.
L:  Um, or my right arm --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, if she -- if it weren't her, if it were someone else, I would really have to think hard, um, 'cause you know, I -- I could really use that money.  [LAUGH]
R:  Now, what if it wasn't her?  What if it wasn't her?
L:  [SIGH] And, it was someone else?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, say, one of my other friends -- yeah, actually, I would probably take the money.   I would probably sacrifice the friendship.
R:  Mhm.  You know what I would probably do in that situation is, of course, you know, 'cause there's gonna be hurt feelings of course, you know, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I wonder if you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- could say to the person who you're not going to speak to again for the rest of your life -- was that -- was that the rest of your life you're never gonna speak to them again?
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  The condition?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I wonder if you couldn't just say to them, you know, "Look, this is -- this is how it is, and I'm willing to split this with you".
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And, then I guess, there wouldn't be as much hurt feelings -- I could sure use the money, too.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  And, I'm sure they could as well.
L:  Yeah, but, I won- I wonder.
R:  You -- you'd always second guess yourself, wouldn't you?  I guess --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's the point of -- of money, because it -- although ... I don't know, I guess you could be very altruistic, and go, "Oh, well, you know --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- "I didn't -- I didn't do that, and I'm really happy, and I'm --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- always gonna be glad I made that decision".  And, then are you going to be?
L:  Yeah, and then you'd have to live with the guilt, the second guessing, the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what could have been --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- what if -- what if that best friend that you dropped, you know -- I don't know -- inherited a whole bunch of money, and then would have been willing to share it with you --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but, you took this other road, or something like that, or -- I don't know --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- [SIGH], but --
R:  Do you believe in karma?  You --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- were saying something about that earlier.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I do, too.
L:  You [inaudible] it follows ya. 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I mean, you know, with my luck -- if I were to take the money, I'd walk outside and I'd get hit by a truck.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Something like that, and I think that you have to live the purest, simplest life possible.
R:  Mhm.
L:  In order to truly be happy.
R:  Yeah, I think so, too, I don't -- I'm not, um -- I'm not a big one for [SIGH] manipulating, and that kind of thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, manipulate -- manipulating your life, I guess, to make sure that you're happy. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And, there are certain things that you just can't be happy with, I mean, how many people -- well, you know, they always say "Love doesn't ...", or "Money doesn't buy you love".
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  And, you know --
L:  And --
R:  -- sometimes I suppose that's true -- money doesn't buy happiness, I guess that's it ...
