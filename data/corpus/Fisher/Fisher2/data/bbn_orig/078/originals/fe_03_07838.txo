L:  Hello?
R:  [MN] Um, hi. [NOISE]
L:  Hi.  How are you?
R:  I'm fine thank you.
L:  I thought this was going to be starting tomorrow night. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  Well --
L:  'Cause I just got, um, [MN] uh, on with the young lady today and she said it would be tomorrow night.  But my name is Joe.
R:  Okay.  My na-
L:  I guess --
R:  My name --
L:  No --
R:  -- is Iyda.
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  I'm fine.
L:  And I'm in Philadelphia.
R:  Okay.  I'm in Bastrop, Texas.
L:  How did you hear about the, um, the call?  You know, the, um --
R:  The study?
L:  -- the study.
R:  Uh, from the Internet.  There's a website that I go in all the time.
L:  Okay.
R:  And it's [NOISE] -- it's for refunding.
L:  It's for what?
R:  Refunding.  It's a magazine I subscribe to.
L:  Oh, okay.  Because I'm in Philadelphia here [MN] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and basically the University of Pennsylvania, the school is in Philadelphia.
R:  I realise that.
L:  Right.  So, what they want, I guess, is -- is this the first time for you or you been doing it?
R:  No, this is my second time.
L:  Okay.  And how'd you make out the first time?
R:  Uh, it was okay.  It was about, um, [NOISE] uh, oh, what would you --
L:  Well, we got [MN] --
R:  -- how -- what should the government do about terrorism?  Something like that.
L:  Oh, okay.  'Cause I guess this is legit.  I mean, I'm not sure.  I mean, I --
R:  But the question t- today is about, um --
L:  Yeah, a million dollars.
R:  If they gave me --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a million dollars would I leave the U.S. forever?
L:  Well, you --
R:  No. [LAUGH]
L:  -- why don't you start.
R:  [MN] Well, I wouldn't.
L:  [MN] Okay.
R:  Money doesn't mean everything to me.
L:  That's okay.
R:  Be --
L:  Well, a million dollars, uh, I don't think I would do so either but [MN] the only reason, well, where would you go?  If you had a place where you can go with a million dollars --
R:  [MN] That --
L:  -- that is --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- uh, close to the U.S., say, uh, I guess, Puerto Rico.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or, uh, H- Hawaii, is that --.
R:  That's kinda far for me.
L:  O- okay.  But a million dollars. [MN] And it's a little corner if you have kids.  What's your situation?  Do you have grandparents?
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  You know? [MN] If you have grandchildren?
R:  Remember it says forever, so ...
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  [MN] Remember they said, "Forever".
L:  Forever.
R:  [NOISE] So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you can't come and visit [LAUGH] I guess. [NOISE]
L:  Well, I mean if --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- what do you mean, and never come back?
R:  That's what they said, "Never come back".
L:  Well you could always, uh, ship the kids or the grandchildren out there, but a million dollars is a lot of money.  Now, I'm fifty eight years old --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- okay?
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  So, I've been through the ropes --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and the idea is that if, uh, I could take my wife -- now, it didn't say if you could take anybody with you.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Did it?
R:  No. [MN]
L:  So, if --
R:  But I'm assuming that you can if you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- would like to. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, but a million dollars could take a few people with you.  So, [MN] uh, [inaudible] pack up my wife, uh, take her out to Hawaii or somewhere -- I don't think Puerto Rico.  Somewhere -- how about Canada?
R:  [MN] Uh, yeah.
L:  Right above the U.S.
R:  If you like the cold weather, yeah.
L:  Well, there you could go up to Montreal.
R:  [MN] Yeah, that's nice up there.
L:  And for a million dollars, I'm sure you could live comfortably and, uh, [MN] and, uh, have your, uh, children --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- or grandchildren just [MN] --
R:  [MN] They didn't --
L:  -- uh, ship up there.
R:  -- they didn't say, [LIPSMACK] [MN] any other thing.  They just gave you a blank statement.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I mean, you might --
L:  I would take the million dollars.  I would.
R:  I'd have to think about it, but you did bring up some good points.  That you could bring your family with you --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and [MN] another --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- country which is close by.
L:  That's right. [MN]
R:  Either -- 
L:  [MN] And Canada's one.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, you could go right across the border of, uh, New York --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or North Dakota --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and shoot right up that way and, uh, take it from there.  And then a million dollars, you put it in the bank [MN] drew a million dollars and [MN] up there you can [MN], uh, five, six percent interest, which is what?  Sixty thousand dollars?
R:  [MN] I don't know.
L:  And live like a king.
R:  Is it that much, really?
L:  Sure.  And the idea is too, to work on what your living conditions are [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [MN] you know, before time. [NOISE] 
R:  Well, we're just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- average. [LAUGH]
L:  You know, that's the thing.
R:  Average people.
L:  Well, [MN] same here.  I mean, I've worked all my life --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I struggled all my life.  And it's always something with money that causes most of the arguments [MN] in the family.
R:  Uh --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- yeah, not in my family. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, that's good.  Yeah, well, I mean, not big arguments.  I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there's always something like a water bill, a gas bill --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- situation, [MN] all right, well you being in Texas --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  -- I guess you're, uh -- uh --
R:  The electric bill is high.
L:  [MN] That's all you have is electric, right?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Obviously you don't have heat.  Where in Texas do you live?
R:  Uh, near Austin.  It's about in the middle --
L:  Okay, I was down in Fort --
R:  -- of the state.
L:  Okay, I was at F- -- when I was in F-, uh, Fort Hood, Texas for --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- my basic training back --
R:  It -- 
L:  -- in, uh --
R:  That's in Killeen, isn't it?
L:  Yeah, that's -- it's in Killeen --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I was, uh --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- there. [MN] Took my basic training and then I w-
R:  In the summer?
L:  Um, matter of fact it was December, January.
R:  Oh, 'cause it's pleasant then.
L:  Well, it was -- yeah, but I remember snow down there, near Dallas. [MN] But --
R:  Near Dallas?
L:  -- and then I went to F-, uh, Fort Poke, Louisiana.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't know if you ever heard of that?
R:  [MN] No.
L:  That's near, like, uh, Alexandria or Leesville, Louisiana.  But Austin --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Texas, that sounds pretty interesting. Tha- -- is that the capital of --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- Texas?
R:  Yes, it is.  
L:  So, it's a pretty --
R:  And it's very hot here --
L:  -- popu- --
R:  -- in the summer.
L:  Well --
R:  It's disgustingly hot.
L:  Really?
R:  It's ninety five. [MN]
L:  Well, it's ninety here today --
R:  Aw.
L:  -- and we're in Philadelphia. [MN] But getting back to that subject.  I mean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [MN] you may be in a good area down there in [MN] --
R:  [MN]
L:  Y- you know, and -- 
R:  Well --
L:  -- I'm in a-- 
R:  It's actually, um, [LIPSMACK] a lot of people losing their jobs because of the [MN] -- what do you call it?  The high tech jobs?
L:  Okay.
R:  [MN] Austin is a high tech city -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  and so a lot of these companies are leaving town or -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- or closing up and c- downsizing, so -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- a lot of people have lost their jobs.
L:  Yeah, well I work for health care, I don't know if you ever heard of it, it's, uh, Tenet Health Care.
R:  What is it?
L:  Tenet. T.E.N.E.T.
R:  No, I've never heard of -- 
L: Okay -- 
R:  -- that.
L:  -- well, it's the same situation all over [MN] with the jobs --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- losing their jobs.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, if somebody wanted to give me a million dollars -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- to pull out of this country right now, [MN] uh, I wouldn't [MN] go and, uh, you know, [MN] like I said, uh, a far area -- 
R:  No.
L:  -- I would, uh, pull up my stakes maybe in Canada --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- right above the border.
R:  Well, Canada doesn't sound too bad if you like the cold, because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it -- their culture is more or less like ours.
L:  Well, you -- you figure Texas, you're always hot down there.
R:  Yes.
L:  Uh, where I'm at, we put --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- up with snow, we had twenty six inches of -- 
R:  Well -- 
L:  -- snow.
R:  -- see, I'm originally from New York. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, so you know -- 
R:  So I know what it's like. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Right, so you know what it is.
R:  We lived about [MN] [NOISE] six hours from the Canadian border.
L:  Mm, okay.
R:  So it was cold that's [MN] -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- but that's not the reason we came here was for our children.  They live here.
L:  I see.
R:  But -- 
L:  [MN] A million -- 
R:  But I can't take this heat, it's too -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- unbearable. Ugh.
L:  Well, you have your -- obviously got central air, I would -- 
R:  Yeah, oh --
L:  -- presume.
R:  -- of course.
L:  Yeah, I -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- hate the heat, too.
R:  You can't live -- 
L:  We have -- 
R:  -- here without it.
L:  Yeah, but a million dollars you can buy yourself a nice little, uh, little air conditioned, uh, little [MN] -- I mean [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Little cabin there, and live --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- comfortably, a nice house and -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a million dollars is a lot of money, and if it's -- 
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well -- 
L:  -- tax free.
R:  -- I'd have to think about it, really good.
L:  [MN] Yeah, not me.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  If th- -- if th- they came to me tomorrow, handed me a million dollars and, uh, tax free?  I'd put that money in the bank, I'd draw interest, I'd find myself a nice house right above there -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the border.  I'd live there, I'd [MN] -- I'd have my wife with me, I'd get my grandchildren, any time they want to come, I just [MN] put 'em on a plane, ship 'em out.  Because, y- -- you know, it's funny, uh, I have a, uh, uh, a son that's thirty one that has two, uh, grandchildren -- 
R:  Uh huh.
L:  -- and, uh, I see them, like, maybe -- and they're not that far, they live in New Jersey.  And I see them, like, once every month or month and a half.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, [MN] I, you know --
R:  You don't see them that often really.
L:  Huh?
R:  It's not that often.
L:  No.
R:  [NOISE] Mm.
L:  So, I wouldn't -- would be [MN] to send a -- a pl- -- you know, give 'em plane tickets.  For a million dollars, that much money.
R:  I guess you could do that, yes. [LAUGH]
L:  And I like race horsing too and, uh, [MN] I --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- would find myself a nice horse to keep my occupied. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, brother.
L:  [MN] I'd buy --
R:  You might lose your money too. [LAUGH]
L:  Nah, no, I wouldn't go crazy that way.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Especially if they give you a million dollars.
R:  [MN]
L:  [MN] But this, uh, survey is really weird. [MN]
R:  It is.
L:  Because, uh, you said the second time.  Now, the first time you talked, [MN] what did they tell that [MN] basically they do?  Uh, forward you [MN], uh, funds, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- after their -- you talk three times or --
R:  [MN] You can talk three times.  When I signed up on the Internet.  Or I think you can do more than three if you want to.
L:  [MN] Well, the girl that I spoke to tonight, [MN] uh, obviously said there's a computer that you can dial into --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- give your pin number --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and then it connects you with another person.
R:  Correct.
L:  And there's certain times that you do this.  Like, from six to eight --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- is what I picked because that's the time I come home from work --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I'm done dinner.  Now, you're two hours difference, right?
R:  Oh, one hour.  Oh, no wonder. [MN] It's five twenty two here --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- so it's six --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- twenty two over there.
L:  Okay.  That's six, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, then they send you, uh, [MN] a check or a check?
R:  Yeah.  A check.
L:  One check?
R:  I don't know.  I haven't gotten it yet but other people that I know have gotten checks.
L:  Well, s- so you know people that did this?
R:  Yes.
L:  And it's a legitimate thing?
R:  Yeah.  Oh, yes.  It's the University of Pennsylvania.
L:  Right, I understand that.  But see wh- --
R:  Yeah, it's legit.  It's --
L:  -- [MN] wha- --
R:  -- legit.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's some --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- kind of linguistic study.
L:  Right.  And it's gonna be lasting through when?
R:  That I don't know.
L:  Uh, she t- -- one guy told me last night, through December, then she told me, like, either, uh, [MN] the end of the summer, Septem- --
