R:  Hello, my name's Andrew.
L:  Hi, I'm Nancy.  I'm in California.
R:  Yeah, I'm in Berkeley, California.
L:  You are too?
R:  Yeah.  You're in Berkeley also?
L:  Oh, in Berkeley.  I'm in Los Angeles.
R:  Oh, in L.A.  Okay.  I spoke to somebody yesterday in L.A.  Uh, so we're supposed to talk about what's acceptable comedy and what's not acceptable? 
L:  Yeah.  Right.  
R:  [LAUGH]  So what do you think?
L:  Well, I think -- [MN] well, are we talking about the, um, TV?
R:  About, sorry?
L:  [MN]  I'm not sure if we're talking about movies or TV?
R:  Okay.  Uh, let's say TV.  That's fine.  
L:  Pardon me?
R:  Yeah, okay, [MN] whatever you want?  Uh, TV's --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- fine.
L:  Well, I think that acceptable on TV is anything that you wouldn't mind your minor children being in the same room with.  As far as movies, that's something else.  
R:  Okay.  So you have children?  Is that right?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Okay.  So how do you control what they watch on TV?
L:  Well, my children are not -- now adults.
R:  Oh.  Oh, they're adults now, okay?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Right.  But when they were children, uh, did you let them watch, uh, whatever they wanted to or, uh ...?
L:  No.  No.  
R:  No.  Okay.  So some comedies were inappropriate.  They were too adult, um, for them?
L:  Yeah, I think so.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think so.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't think that they need to be exposed to that stuff [MN] if they're not ready for it.  
R:  Okay.  And would it be different standards for, uh, adults, uh -- I guess when you go to movies, uh, that are adult rated, I guess it would be different or no?
L:  Yeah.  I think so because there you have a choice.  I mean, you pay your money and -- and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you see what you want to see.
R:  And is -- is anything acceptable or, um, if it's insulting to certain people?  For example, comedy usually makes fun of people but, um -- like how far can they go in terms of insulting people?  Like can they insult a whole race of people or, you know, stuff like that?  They usually make fun of different groups, right?
L:  Yeah.  [MN]  I personally don't go for that.  
R:  Okay.
L:  Um ...
R:  So it just -- it just should --
L:  I mean there's [MN] so many other things that you can laugh at, and -- and that's not funny.  
R:  It just shouldn't be mean, right?
L:  I think so.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [MN]  Okay.  Your turn.
R:  Okay.
L:  What do you think about TV?
R:  About TV?  I guess it depends, uh -- I'm house sitting right now and they've got something on that whenever I watch certain shows I have to put in a secret code which the kids don't know.  It's a eleven year old boy and a ten year old boy.  And that way they control what the kids watch.  And so there's certain channels, like HBO -- I don't know if -- if you get that, um, that are -- are much more adult so the kids can't watch that.  So I think if there's some type of thing blocking kids from watching it and just, uh, restricting it to adults then it's okay.  
L:  Say that last thing again.  I didn't quite hear you.
R:  Um, well they've got this thing on their TV here in this house that I'm staying at and it blocks the kids from watching adult shows.  So if they had something like that on all the TVs then I -- then I think that, um, it would be okay to have more adult comedy on regular television.
L:  Oh.  Okay.  
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, so, yeah.  Now some of the comedy is very insulting to different groups so I think that goes too far, so I'm pretty much in agreement with you.
L:  Are you old enough to remember Archie Bunker?
R:  Yeah, I liked that show actually.  But there -- there's something soft about the way he did it.  He [MN] -- it wasn't that hateful.  Did you find it disturbing?
L:  No, I didn't.  I -- I thought it -- I really thought it was funny.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But wh- why do you think it wasn't disturbing?  Because he -- he was certainly was a bigot.
R:  Um, he had a good heart so that made it a little bit better.  Also in the beginning, uh, it was almost as if he was the butt of the joke as opposed to whoever he was making fun of.  They didn't make him too glamorous or anything like that. 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  It -- it just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It just didn't seem all that mean to me.  But at the time it was --
L:  Proba- probably because he -- he was being victimized himself.  
R:  Yep.
L:  For -- for being stupid.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  
L:  Huh.  Interesting.  I never thought about it that way.  
R:  Yeah, but at the time it was a very controversial show.  Uh, when it first came out.  
L:  Yeah.  Yes, it was.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  But look how many years it lasted.  
R:  Many, many years.  That's true.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Are there any comedies on sho- -- on TV that you've liked in the past?
L:  Um, I don't -- I actually I don't watch that much TV.
R:  Okay.  Did you watch like The Lucy Show or Mary Tyler Moore Show or anything years ago or not really?
L:  Um, if -- if -- from time to ti- -- I -- I guess in -- in the past I was more of a, um, TV fan than I am right now.
R:  Right.
L:  Uh, right now, th- there's nothing -- there really isn't too much on that -- that I think -- that interests me.  
R:  Well, most of the shows are really made for teenagers.  They're the audience that the advertisers are trying to get at.  So people who've been around for a while who remember Archie Bunker, like +you or me were not exactly the audience they're looking for so they make the show for younger people.
L:  But look at the, um, the ages of population.  The population --
R:  It's getting older.
L:  -- in our country is getting older.  
R:  That's true.  
L:  Um, but from what you're saying, and I agree with it, the -- the a- advertisers aren't following the older population.
R:  Right.  If they made shows more for -- for our age group do you think you would be more interested in watching TV or -- or your just done with TV anyways?
L:  No.  [MN]  Well, i- if there was something [MN] -- the one program I enjoy right now --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- is, um, Judging Amy.  
R:  I've never seen that.  Is that a comedy?
L:  Uh, [MN] not exactly.  
R:  I think there's a beautiful woman starring in it.  I don't know why.  I think she was on Law and Order or something like that before?  No? It's a -- is it a legal show?  Is it a police show?  What type of show is it?
L:  No, it -- it's a story of a judge who lives with h- with her child, her small child, and lives with --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- her mother who is a social worker.
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, who investigates child abuse cases.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And it -- it's, um, so it -- it combines the workings of the court with the workings of a public agency.
R:  Okay.
L:  Protecting -- protecting kids.  And it -- it is amusing.  It's, um, intense.  It's dramatic.  It's all that stuff rolled into one.
R:  Uh-huh.  And so you watch that pretty regularly.
L:  I really like that show.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What day is it on?
L:  Um, it's on -- it just switched so I'm not -- oh, it's on Tuesday nights at ten here.
R:  And it's on network TV, is that right?
L:  Pardon?
R:  Is it on network TV?
L:  Uh-huh.  It's on, um, channel two maybe.  I think.
R:  Yeah, probably would be a different channel in -- in San Fr- -- in Berkeley.
L:  [MN]  Yeah.  For you.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Sure.  Do you watch a lot of TV?
R:  Um, I usually live in Thailand and don't have a TV so, uh, no I don't.  But, uh, now that I'm staying at a house and looking after the animals, uh, I'm using their computer and watching TV and enjoying it.
L:  What do you do in Thailand?
R:  I teach English.
L:  Really?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That's great.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  How long have you been doing that? 
R:  Uh, for four years.  
L:  [MN]  No TV over there?
R:  Oh, they have.  But, um, usually I'm busy with other things.  
L:  Uh, okay.
R:  But here I'm in a strange town for me.  Well, it's back -- it's home but it's a while since I've been here.  So I'm just enjoying doing nothing for a while.
L:  Oh.  Oh. 
R:  I've only been back for five days now.
L:  Whoa.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So how'd you get involved in this research?
R:  I saw it on the internet so I signed up two days ago and this is -- three days ago and this is my third time already.
L:  [LAUGH]  I've been getting a --
R:  No, second time, I mean.  Uh --
L:  Second time?
R:  Did it yesterday and I did it, uh, today and perhaps I'll do it tomorrow.
L:  Yeah.  I've been getting one call a day.  
R:  Oh, you have.  So this is your third time?  Is that right?
L:  Well, no.  Actually it's about my fifth time.
R:  I thought you could only do it three times?
L:  I guess i- if you let them know that you're willing to do it more that they'll give you the go ahead.
R:  And do they pay you for each time?  Is it ten dollars a time?  Is that how they --
L:  I think so.
R:  -- do it?
L:  I think so.  
R:  Oh, okay.  And you don't get paid for a while, is that right?  It takes like eight weeks, the person yesterday told me.
L:  I don't know.  
R:  Okay.  
L:  I don't --
R:  But you haven't gotten paid yet, right?
L:  Huh?
R:  You haven't gotten ...?
L:  No, I haven't gotten paid.  I just started it about six days ago.
R:  Oh, okay.  So you've done it five times already?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Oh, maybe I'll [LAUGH] be doing it this often also.  
L:  Yeah, do [MN] --
R:  And do you speak to people from all over the country or is it -- or are they
