R:  Hi, my name is Sharon.
L:  Hi, my name's Lois.
R:  Hi, Lois.  Well what type of business would you start?
L:  Um, I think I would start a, um, dog grooming salon.
R:  Oh would you really?
L:  Yeah, I love animals, I would, uh, I would like to work with animals.
R:  So would you do it in your home or rent a building or buy a building?
L:  No, I would, uh, rent a building or, um, even have a van and go to people's houses that can't get out of the house.
R:  Oh, that's a new concept, I hadn't heard of that yet.
L:  Yeah, they have it down in Florida, my mother has, uh, her -- her woman comes to her house and grooms the dog.
R:  Oh that's a wonderful idea.
L:  What would you open?
R:  Well, I think maybe I would try an antique shop.
L:  Oh yeah, that would be nice.
R:  Uh, I worked in an antique shop, uh, fi- quite a few years back and I have a friend who owned an antique shop, she's just recently closed her shop, but I think I would try, uh, [MN] buying of a house and having part of it in there, you know.
L:  That would be nice 'cause then you wouldn't even have to drive --
R:  Right.
L:  -- anywhere.  That sounds interesting.  Um, how would you go about it?
R:  Well, I would probably set it up, uh, start a work schedule having been open in the shop maybe two or three days a week.  And if money were no object, designate, uh, two or three days of going on buying trips and shopping.
L:  Yeah, that would be nice.  I would, um, start -- I would train first.  My girlfriend owns a dog groo- grooming salon, so I would kinda ask her how she went about it, I know she had to go to school first.
R:  Oh, she did?
L:  Yeah, so I'd have to, uh, you know, get time off from my job, go to the school and then, um, maybe work in her shop for a few days and then ask her how she went about opening up her own business and, uh, if money was no object I'd open it in a nice area so I'd have clients that have money!  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh right!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You'd have a read- ready made audience there. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I'd, um, also have, you know, a [inaudible] you could board the dogs also.
R:  Oh that's a good idea.
L:  [MN]
R:  A lotta people like that.
L:  Yeah.  'Cause I have a dog home and I work for an airline and I always have a problem finding dog sitters, so I can never go anywhere, I'm always stuck coming home early or I -- I don't like to really -- I don't like to leave him.
R:  Oh, I know, I -- I have some cats too and it can create a problem.
L:  Yeah, it's hard.
R:  It really can.  They really --
L:  Cats are easier 'cause you can leave 'em for a few days.
R:  Yeah, right, well [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it just [inaudible] the door when you get back. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, right. [LAUGH]  Mine's like, terrorizing my house for when I get home.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  What airline do you work for?
L:  US Airways.
R:  US Airways.  You know we've --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- they don't service our area, where I live, I'm in Illi- --
L:  Oh, where do you live?
R:  I'm in Illinois.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  And --
L:  Wow, people call from all over.
R:  Yeah.  Where are you from?
L:  Um, East Rutherford, New Jersey.
R:  Oh, you're from New Jersey, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, um, I don't know if I would open up my salon here or [LAUGH] maybe in Florida, I don't know.  I'll probably live here the rest of my life. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  The way things are going. [LAUGH]
R:  I know what you mean.
L:  [MN]
R:  I think I'm stuck in Illinois too.  Uh, the thing about the midwest with -- with the antique arena is that, uh, antiques in this area are generally a little bit cheaper than like, on either coast.
L:  Wow.
R:  You know, they -- 'cause I know when I worked in the one antique shop there were people -- there -- there were a few different people who would make regular trips from coast to coast at different times of the year and they would be on buying trips.
L:  Wow, I love --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- antiques, I love going antique shopping.
R:  Do you really?
L:  I have a old, really old pot belly stove --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- in my house.  I kinda wanted to know if it was worth anything but I don't know, my mother made the mistake of painting it and I think it -- she should've left it the way it was.
R:  Yeah, more natural.  But you know, this [several inaudible words] with whatever you wanna do with them, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It isn't always the value of it that matters.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, it's what you want to do with it.
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's pretty but I wouldn't mind selling it right now 'cause I'm in a bind moneywise, so I wouldn't really mind selling it.
R:  Well, I tell ya, that was my problem, when I worked at the antique shop I rented a booth also.
L:  Oh.
R:  And [MN] I rented a booth from the woman I worked under and, uh, I would stock it and sell things and a lot of the nice things that I had, I've -- I mean, I'm completely gone of a lotta things, you know.
L:  Wow.
R:  Because I sold them all.
L:  Right.
R:  But, uh, sometimes you can make a pretty good profit, other times you can't --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know.  It varies on how much your outlay for the item is to begin with.
L:  Yeah.  I don't have too many antiques.  I have an antique Singer sewing machine, I don't know if that's worth anything, it was my grandmother's.
R:  Yeah, they are.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, they really are.
L:  Oh, I should go see.  I hate to sell it but I don't sew and it's just sitting in my apartment.
R:  You know where you might try is Ebay.
L:  Oh.
R:  Have you ever been in Ebay?
L:  No, I've never been on Ebay.
R:  Go in on Ebay and look up their auction site --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and g- look it up and s- try to get an idea of how much they're selling for.
L:  Oh, okay.  So you just put in Ebay and then put Singer sewing machine in?
R:  Yeah, you would go to Ebay and then their auction site.  Get on Ebay and then the --
L:  Oh okay.
R:  -- auctions.  And then go on the auction site and then look up and see h- how much they're selling for.
L:  That's interesting.
R:  Or do you know any antique --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- dealers in the area that are reputable?
L:  Um, not really.  I know there's one antique store that I pass by that I've seen, I have never been in there, maybe I could go in there and ask.
R:  Yeah, you might ask.  But I tell you what, a lot of antique dealers are paying less than half of the value of the item.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, uh, I, you know, I wanna warn you that because a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- lot of -- a lot of dealers were paying half --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and now they've gone down to less than that.
L:  Wow.  So when you go on Ebay they just se- send you a check?  That's kind of -- like, how do you do that? [LAUGH]
R:  Well --
L:  They --
R:  I -- I -- I have never done it myself, my friend has done it for me, but you go in on Ebay and you list your item for sale.
L:  Oh.
R:  And then like, you can set it to have a -- a -- a bi- -- uh, a bidding on like, maybe four days or seven days.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And you let the bidding go and you keep checking on it to see how high it is.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And whoever is the highest bidder --
L:  Oh, and --
R:  -- will get the item.
L:  And then you work it out with them how --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they're gonna get it?
R:  [MN] Yeah, you contact them, uh, and about how they're going to pay you and everything and about your shipping it to them.
L:  Wow.  That's good.
R:  [MN] Now, a lotta antique dealers are going to doing on the internet, uh, [SIGH] I like the personal touch of the shop myself, where you can go in and touch it and feel it and pick it up and look at it from every angle and everything, you know.
L:  Yeah, I like that better --
R:  Yeah, I do too.
L:  -- than doing it on the computer.
R:  Well, you know what you're getting.
L:  Right.
R:  And, um, I -- I -- I think if a -- this woman that just closed her, uh, business, she had the ideal home, she had an eighteenth century home.
L:  Oh, how nice.
R:  So it's in the ball park, but she just didn't really dedicate herself, I don't think, that much to the business, you know.
L:  Wow.
R:  And it could've been a fantastic thing.
L:  Yeah, 'cause that's such a beautiful old house.
R:  Oh yes, it was just --
L:  Gosh.
R:  -- really wonderful.
L:  My -- oh --
R:  It's really a shame, you know.
L:  My ex boyfriend, he used to go to all these garage sales and he's got his house filled with antiques and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- he's got some really nice pieces.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, I used to -- you can do that.  Now it's harder to do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, I'd say five, six years back you could do that a lot easier than you can now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  These --
L:  This was a while ago, when he's m- furnished his house.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Uh, I know there for a while I was doing really good on, well, when I worked at the antique shop and was going out and picking things up to buy and sell.
L:  Wow.
R:  You know.  But --
L:  My friend's doing pretty well with her, uh, dog grooming salon.  She just opened it like, less than a year ago and she's got a really nice store because the -- the girl who owned it, um, she filed bankruptcy so my friend was able to pick the store up and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- she left all the cages for the dogs, so she didn't have to pay for any of the cages, which was a -- a lotta money for the cages --
R:  Oh right.
L:  -- so she left out with that, and she met another girl in her class, so they got to be partners.  So I guess I would try to do that, maybe hook up with somebody else --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, um, you know, pair up with that person.
R:  And that way you wouldn't have to be there five, six days a week either.
L:  Right.  Yeah --
R:  You know.
L:  -- my friend is, um, here herself right now.  In fact, I'm actually using her telephone, I wonder if that matters with this?
R:  Oh, I don't think so.
L:  I hope not.
R:  I don't either.
L:  'Cause I gave her mine.
R:  So you -- did she have a ready made clientele then, they come back regularly and everything?
L:  Yeah, they're starting to come back now.  She started from scratch and she was new to this area so she -- they're doing pretty good, the s- regulars are starting to come back and, uh, you know, sh- she also has a part time job at a veterinarians and she grooms there too --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- for extra income.
R:  Oh, that's great.
L:  Yeah.  So I guess I could do that also.
R:  Yeah, work in a --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- veterinarian's office.
L:  Mm.
R:  You know, part time.
L:  Right.  My problem right now is, um, having the time. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you're a -- you -- you're an airline stewardess, you said, right?
L:  Well, I work -- no, I don't -- I don't fly, I work in a airport, so it's a five day, uh, jo- -- you know.
R:  Oh, you work --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- in the airport?
L:  Yeah, I could ch- swap days off so if I wanted to go to school I could swap my days off 'cause there's not too much overtime anymore so people are glad to pick up your hours.
R:  Oh, so you'd be able to get the schooling.
L:  Yeah, just a matter of, uh, I'd have to have the money to back me up.
R:  Yeah, but you need the funding.  Well --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- money were no object you'd have the money but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for a lotta people money is an object.
L:  I know. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  This is true.
R:  [LAUGH] Way of life --
L:  Unbelievable.
R:  -- I think. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  E- except for the lucky few. [LAUGH]
L:  I have to win the lottery! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm trying! [SIGH]
R:  There we go. [LAUGH]
L:  Yep.  But that was just -- it's always when you don't buy the ticket when the number comes in.
R:  I know.  I know.
L:  Right.
R:  Oh well, I was never that lucky I don't think. [LAUGH]
L:  I won one time. [LAUGH]
R:  Did you?
L:  I won like, three hundred dollars, so that was nice.
R:  Oh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, well that's great.
L:  And it was a ticket that was laying on my kitchen counter for like, a -- a month and I just happened to go to the store that day 'cause I had bought n- a fish tank and I felt really guilty 'cause it was a two -- it was about three hundred dollars for a tank, and I said, oh -- oh, I felt so
