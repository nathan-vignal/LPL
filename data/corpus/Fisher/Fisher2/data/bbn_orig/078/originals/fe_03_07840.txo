L:  [LIPSMACK] I am Theresa Sanchez from Boston.
R:  Hi, Lisa from Cleveland, Ohio. [NOISE]
L:  Okay.  Are we supposed to talk?
R:  Yeah.  This is my --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- first one, I've never did one before.
L:  I have never done one either.
R:  Um, they asked if you would leave the United States for a million dollars?
L:  Yeah, so would you?
R:  Um, you know what?  I don't think I would.
L:  Okay.
R:  Uh, money's really nice but, I don't know, the freedom and the comfort that I have with the United States I think I would stay. [NOISE] [LIPSMACK]
L:  I agree.  Um, I also think I'd spend -- a million dollars isn't really that much anymore.
R:  No, and --
L:  Um --
R:  -- actually it -- it -- it's not.
L:  And that would be gone and then you're -- you're where?  Where you go from there? [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH] Um, so yeah.  I don't know what else to talk about for another ten minutes in regard to that.  I guess what we -- we miss, um ...
R:  The freedom, um --
L:  Absolutely, yeah.
R:  Just being able to -- the -- the freedom in general, or just being able to do what you want in fairness.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, you -- like going to fricking Iraq or something, no way.
L:  Oh yeah, that would definitely not is happening.  And like, Europe -- even Europe, I mean, over there they've got bombs going on, like in Ireland and, uh, you know, Is- -- well, Israel's not Europe but, uh --
R:  Besides, a million dollars not enough to stake my life, I mean ...
L:  Exactly.  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It does not sound appealing. [LAUGH]  It sounds appealing for like, a odd second.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um --
R:  It's like, "Whoa, a million bucks".
L:  Totally.  Mm.  Yeah, um, but I guess if I did, which I probably wouldn't, but if I did I would probably go to like, I don't know, Italy, that sounds like a nice place.
R:  Yeah.  I don't --
L:  I've heard a lot of good things about it.
R:  I guess when I think outta US, I mean, I'm thinking like, Iraq and, you know, burly places really, really, outta here, that are, like, dangerous.
L:  Oh really?  That's -- that's neat that you took that p- uh, perspective of that.  So --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you think like, what they meant is, uh, somewhere that's like, the complete opposite of here or just anywhere in the world?
R:  Well, they didn't specify but -- I know w- when I first heard it, I don't know, I guess it's just me, that's -- it -- that's the first thing I thought was [NOISE] -- was that like really [NOISE], really outta here, not ...
L:  Mhm.  Oh.
R:  But nope, I'll stay  here.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And be poor and clip coupons.
L:  [LAUGH] There's nothing wrong with clipping coupons.
R:  Heck no.
L:  Do they even have coupons in other countries like [LAUGH] --
R:  Exactly, I would -- I would go crazy --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- without my coupons.
L:  [SIGH] Oh my.
R:  Say, "Here's your money back, give me the Sunday papers for crying out loud!"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Hm.
L:  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  What's your favorite part, other than freedom, in America?
R:  Um, I think because I've been here for so long, it's more -- it's a comfort thing.
L:  How long is so long?
R:  Well, I'm almost thirty.
L:  Oh really?
R:  Yeah.  I've been here my whole entire life.
L:  You sound younger than thirty.
R:  That's what everybody says, they mistake me for my kids.
L:  Oh, are you kidding?
R:  They're like -- they're like, "Put your mom on the phone".  I was like, "I am the mom!"  They're like, "No you're not, put the mom on the phone".  I'm like, "I'm trying to order a fricking pizza!" Huh!
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, you probably can't order pizza in another country. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.
L:  Probably not like the whole background check.
R:  Oh pizza, I love my pizza.
L:  And you're in where, Cleveland?
R:  Cleveland, Ohio, yeah.  Where'd you --
L:  They have pizza there?
R:  -- say you were at?
L:  I'm in Boston.
R:  Boston.  My aunt lives there.
L:  Oh really?
R:  Boston, Massachusetts, yeah, she's actually up here for -- for a visit.
L:  Oh that's neat.  [PAUSE]  Wow.  And you got -- how did you find out about this?
R:  Um, I subscribe to a refunding ... um, site.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you learn -- gosh, that's how I learned how to get pa- -- I get paid to shop.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they had, you know, women was reporting about the Fisher thing and I was like, "Oh heck, I'll try it".
L:  Yeah, ten dollars for ten minutes.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  You can't beat that. [SIGH]
R:  No, especially we know what we can do with ten dollars. [LAUGH]  When you do --
L:  Yeah, coupons!
R:  -- use coupons!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Huh.
L:  Yeah, my friend can go to the grocery store and like, spend nine dollars for like, a week, and have enough food for the whole --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- week, like she's -- she's crazy.
R:  Oh yeah, that's -- that's easy to do.  And not only that, and then you get money back from rebates.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, Boston's expensive though.
R:  Oh I know, my aunt said cartons of cigarettes were very -- 'cause she smokes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I buy her cigarettes here and send 'em to her.
L:  Yeah, they're, uh -- did you know that that's illegal to do?
R:  No, I didn't!
L:  That and alcohol you're not allowed to mail into Massachusetts.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, I g- --
R:  Wow, the post office is --
L:  I used to mail wine to my friends, wine and cookies, and they were like, "You're not allow- -- you're not allowed to sell -- you're not allowed to mail tobacco products or alcohol".
R:  Oh my goodness, the, um, post office never said a word.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause they ask you --
L:  I was shocked --
R:  They ask you what's in there --
L:  -- 'cause I'd done it for a good couple of years.
R:  -- and I'm like, "Cigarettes".  "Oh, okay".
L:  Wow.
R:  They a- -- the only thing they asked is if the carton was ever opened and I said, "Not by me". [NOISE]
L:  Nice.
R:  Wow, learn something new every day, huh?
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's like some whole like, ATS like, thing, I don't know, it's weird.  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But yeah, smoking -- they -- they stopped -- you can't smoke in bars up here now.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  It's really weird.
R:  What about cellphones?
L:  Um, cellphones are allowed.
R:  Really?
L:  I know in New York you can't drive with it, you'll get pulled over.
R:  Yeah, that's the way it is here.  In certain parts, like in Cleveland it's not, but right up the street it turns into Brooklyn, Ohio, and you cannot -- you have to pull over to talk.
L:  You're kidding?
R:  Mm.  No, you have --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- to pull over.  The cop sees you doing that and you're [MN] getting a big ticket.
L:  Gosh.  I guess that makes sense though, as people like --
R:  It does because I've seen people, I mean, they're -- I don't know if they're arguing with their -- their wife, their girlfriend or somebody at work and they're mad and they're just irate, they're crazy.
L:  Wow.  Huh.  Yeah, um, I, um, my family's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in DC and they're not allowed to do that down there either.  Too many accidents have ha- taken place that have been directly related to cellphone usage.
R:  Did you hear about the women that got pulled over for breastfeeding?
L:  What?
R:  Yes, that was here.
L:  What?
R:  They arrested her.  She was breastfeeding her baby, driving.
L:  While she was driving?
R:  While she was driving, yeah.  I- right in Michigan.
L:  Well what do you think of that?
R:  Well, [SIGH] that's a tough one because I know when I had a newborn, you know, when they're hungry and you're on the trip, you gotta feed 'em.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  And it -- it's -- uh, it's kinda like I go both ways, you know, I can see her point but then I can also see theirs because it's a safe [MN] -- safety issue.
L:  Yeah, why didn't she pull over?
R:  Right.  Then she said it w- -- every time, you know, 'cause the baby was eating every hour, you know, and she -- 'cause it was a newborn -- and she said it was taking her so long, she was doing it at first but then she said it was taking so long to get there that she just left the baby on her lap because like she said, it was like every hour the baby was eating.
L:  Well how long is she driving for?  Where's she driving?
R:  She was driving -- shit, where's she driving?  Texas I think.
L:  A -- a lot?  Was she doing it often?  I mean --
R:  [COUGH] She just left the baby there ... on her lap.
L:  Wow.
R:  She kept pulling over and feeding it and she was like, "God, I'm never gonna get there" so she, uh, pulls over in Ohio and, yeah, they arrested her.  But you know what --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- she got -- she got out of that though because --
L:  She did?
R:  -- in Michigan, where she's from, it's allowed.
L:  [LAUGH] You're allowed to drive and have a baby breast --
R:  But -- yeah.
L:  Wow.  Wow, I never would even thought of bringing that up, you know what I mean?  Like --
R:  I seen it on the news and I'm like, "Wow!"
L:  That's nuts!  I would never even think of doing that but I guess, you know --
R:  I would be too afraid, you know, driving and you know, what happens if it gets choked -- I don't know, I just -- first of all I wouldn't be driving with a newborn by myself all that way, but you never really --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- know her -- her circumstance.
L:  Right.
R:  But it doesn't take a baby that long, a newborn, and they only take a couple of sips, you know, so it couldn't have took her too long.
L:  Wow.  Hm.  I didn't know ten minutes was this long! [LAUGH]
R:  It's actually -- according to my phone it's been ten minutes and eighteen seconds.
L:  Oh really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But that's from the time I first picked it up so it took her about a minute to explain stuff.
L:  Oh.  Yeah, I don't know how they expect you to talk about that one topic for ten minutes.
R:  I guess certain topics you can, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what I mean?  Like, if they talked about coupons, oh my, [LAUGH] they'd have to -- they should pay me thirty dollars! [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH] A coupon fan, that's great.
R:  [NOISE] That's okay, I'm just doing laundry. [NOISE]
L:  Hm.
R:  But --
L:  So how's the weather in Cleveland?
R:  It -- right now it's pretty humid.
L:  Really?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, it was like, eighty degrees here today.
R:  [SIGH] It's -- the weather's okay but it's just the humidity.  If the humidity --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- wasn't so God awful you could tolerate it.
L:  Yeah, I don't mind dry heat but the wet heat is just --
R:  And it's all --
L:  -- ugh.
R:  -- we ever have here.
L:  Really, it is?
R:  Yeah, constantly.
L:  I didn't know that.
R:  Yes. [NOISE]
