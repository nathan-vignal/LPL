R:  Frank McGarry, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
L:  Chris Perez, Kansas City, Missouri.
R:  Hey, Kansas City.
L:  How are you doing?
R:  Okay, Kansas City moll.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And my name's Chris, again, and your first name is?
R:  Frank.
L:  Frank, okay.
R:  Frank, um, we're supposed to, uh, discuss [LIPSMACK] -- uh, stay on the subject or we don't get paid, I guess that's the idea?
L:  Right.
R:  Relative to, uh -- see if I have it right the million dollars, if I take it, the stipulation is I don't ever talk to my best friend again.
L:  Right.
R:  Right.  Would you do it?
L:  Boy, that's -- that's a good one.  I mean, uh, I think my best friend would probably tell me to take it --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- but I don't know that the quality of my life would be improved if I lost my best friend.
R:  No, but, uh, did you really lose them?  You've got to think of a loophole.  My mind's always like -- like weaving, uh -- some kind of snake -- serpentine idea of how to beat it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, speak -- okay, my -- my best friend's my wife, so, uh, if -- if -- she wouldn't speak ever again, I think it's a deal.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But, no, seriously, I -- I would figure a -- you know, how they're going to -- where they're going to monitor you, what are they going to do, put a camera in your room? [NOISE] I, um -- you [SIGH] -- sure I'll say yeah to anything, but, you know, if -- if we're going to play really ethically here, it's simple morality and -- and, you know, we're living on Pluto somewhere and we're not going to do anything in secret or cheat.  Yes, I would do it, uh, but find another way to communicate with her.  Sign language --
L:  Because that's all they said was just speak, right?
R:  That's right.
L:  So, email would probably work.
R:  Email would work, smoke signals, uh, tap dancing --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [LAUGH] music -- [LAUGH]
L:  I like that, the hand signs --
R:  Sens- sensua- sensuality, I mean, my wife and I still could, you know, kiss each other, all that kind of stuff.  So, [LIPSMACK] yeah, but if -- if -- if -- if you weren't allowed to ever see them again, now that's a problem, now my wife's my best friend, so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that's a big problem, now how to -- [SIGH] somehow they're transported to another planet then I -- I would have a big problem with that.
L:  Well, my best friend happens to be in Switzerland --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- and -- not that I don't love my husband, but I've just known my best friend for --
R:  This is a lady?
L:  -- forever -- yes, a girl, yep, I went to college with and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- boy that's --
R:  Well, the women -- women have best friends more than men do, and that's shame that they do.  I -- I really think I -- I would guess if there was a study about that, you'd find many more women having really -- and where -- and their -- and their best friends are very important to them.  Whereas men tend to be more -- not always, but, you know, more loners, um, and don't speak as much --
L:  Yeah -- and I agree with that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in that they probably do more consider --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- their spouse to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- be their best friend.
R:  Yeah, it has to be -- I think it has to do with our evolution and -- and that's changing.  I think men are changing more like women, you know, it's -- it's more merging but I'm -- I'm , you know, in the old -- you know, men had to hunt and be quiet and -- shoulder to shoulder women -- sat a- -- you know, babies and across the campfire and talked about --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- how -- how inadequate their men folk were.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Knowing their men --
L:  Well, then, you know, I think that question probably is going to be answered differently by men and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- women --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- I mean, obviously so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, depending on who their best friend is and --
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I think everyone's my best friend.
L:  Do you think your wife would want you to do it?
R:  To do it?  Oh, yeah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- she would, we'd find-- uh, like I said, I'd find a short cut, but if we -- if I had to leave her or something, no, it's not important, I mean, what's a million dollars anyway and what's it do for you?  I mean -- and now if you want to go higher ...? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know, that's another dilemma, you know.  I would have said if you ever do -- there's a line drawn -- but you know, uh -- you know, really, if -- if, uh, you know, I have x number of years left, who do I want to spend them with and why?
L:  Right.
R:  And what's -- what's the quality of life based on?
L:  Right.
R:  Is it based on money?  Ah, it helps but it's, you know, I'd -- I'd -- I've never had a lot of money -- I'm a jazz musician, I -- I -- I struggle from day to day and I love it.  I've lived on the edge my whole life.
L:  Sure.
R:  So --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- what -- the money doesn't mean a thing to me, in fact it -- it makes -- it's made me more paranoid in my life, when it comes, so I'd rather it go.  You know, what Omar Sharif said one time -- he had a gambling problem, he was a bridge player and played chemin de fer, you know, [LIPSMACK] he said, "There's lots  -- and better to lo- -- uh, go make a movie, make a couple of million dollars or go over to Monte Carlo and lose every penny? [LAUGH] You go across --"
L:  Wow.
R:  "-- then you go across the street and buy -- just have enough for an espresso coffee and watch the sun come up --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- then, I have to make a new movie". [LAUGH] I -- I -- I think it's a little crazy but I -- I understand that mentality [LIPSMACK] because, you know, I -- you know, mm -- you know, [LIPSMACK] and -- and -- and -- and let's say you did what you did, what would you do with the money?  Say -- say your -- your best friend -- you were able to [SIGH] keep your be- best friend at some other level other than speaking terms and they were really monitoring you -- big brother was monitoring you and you couldn't talk to them and -- what would you do with a million dollars, what is the first thing you'd do?
L:  Wow, what would I do?
R:  Mm.  I mean, other than the self indulgent things we do, you know, just --
L:  Right.  Well, certainly, you know, there's always that, uh, you know, pay off the mortgage, pay off all the bills --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- make sure the family's taken care of --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- send my best friend a huge present --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I imagine would probably be first on the list --
R:  Yeah, yeah, a St. Bernard dog. [LAUGH]
L:  Something, yeah.
R:  They have enough of them over there.
L:  Over in Switzerland, yeah, to pull her around the slopes.
R:  Is she in Geneva or -- is Lucerne or what?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Zurich.
R:  Zurich, okay.
L:  Yep, she's outside of Zurich actually --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- in, um, Oberlandkofen[?].
R:  Oh, okay, [MN].
L:  Yeah, which is --
R:  Try to say three times --
L:  -- French so --
R:  -- real fast.
L:  Yeah, oh man --
R:  -- huh.
L:  -- I'll tell you what, trying to spell even her city -- her street name --
R:  Mm, mhm.
L:  -- is -- is [LAUGH] proving to be difficult but --
R:  I like -- I like Switzerland, it is beautiful, um --
L:  I've never been over there but, uh --
R:  Oh, it's -- it's -- it's --
L:  -- a million dollars and a little trip would --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- probably be fine.
R:  Lucerne, I love very much.  The feather ticks, the -- it's be- beyond belief.  I -- I -- I thought I didn't have to go, I could see it on TV.  It's not right, uh, when you go there it's -- it's beyond belief, you think Heidi's going to come out and kiss you or something, you know --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- unbelievable.
L:  I bet it is gorgeous --
R:  Lots of people with rosy cheeks --
L:  -- I know she loves it.
L:  -- it's disgusting, all these rosy cheeked people running around.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Very stiff minded though, you can't cro- -- [MN] -- you can't cro- -- uh, you can't, uh -- what is it called -- jaywalk, they'll holler at you.
L:  Mhm.
R:  If you don't --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- wait for the red light even if there is no car there.  But, money, [LIPSMACK] I don't know, [SIGH] it's all about money, you know, but where -- I don't know what this study's about really, you know.  They sometimes don't tell you what it really is about, but maybe it is about language and how we communicate and how men talk to men and how women talk to women and [LIPSMACK] colloquialisms and idioms and all that stuff but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so very often they don't tell you what the study's really about.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, because it would screw it, it would change it, so ...  But, that's none of my business, it's their study and -- and, uh --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  -- yeah, and-- and -- and -- I -- they said something about studying accents and regional speech --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- patterns and so forth.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah, and they -- I think that's all changing with television, you know, [SIGH] you -- you -- television's changing -- making us more homogenized in some way.
L:  Oh, I agree.
R:  Don't you think?
L:  I agree, well --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- plus the access to transportation, I mean --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- everybody's moving around the country --
R:  In --
L:  -- for jobs --
R:  In this techno s- --
L:  -- and with the economy so low --
R:  -- this techno stuff, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Certainly -- certainly that as well, I mean, we are getting, um, access to people from around the world right on a computer in our --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- in our home and our bunny slippers and --
R:  And it's making us more indolent, more lazy, I think.  Maybe I'm wrong.
L:  Well --
R:  Maybe I'm wrong, we're sitting in the back room.  First we sat on our porch, then we said, "Hello, neighbor, we have idle time", then we -- then the TV drove us in to watch television, now -- now we're in another room, our face turns green and we [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- tap out emails or how much work we do on it is -- is, uh, suspect.  But --
L:  Well, and I think that that's also -- you know, everybody has their own take on that.
R:  Sure.
L:  Certainly when I'm on the Internet it seems --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- like I am out in search of more people than I --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- would be if I was --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- on the phone or if I was --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- writing letters --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- say.  You know, I have access --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- so much quicker and -- and so much easier, um, for me --
R:  Mhm, but, I mean, you write a letter with a pen, not a quill necessarily, but in --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- your hands there and you lick that stamp and you lick that letter and you send that and you write that address and you put your heart into that letter.  It's not quick, but [SIGH] I wonder how much more heart is there.
L:  I agree, I agree with you and I know my daughter -- I've got a twelve year old and she loves to write letters --
R:  That's why --
L:  -- loves to get mail --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- loves to write letters -- lo- -- her friends love to get mail.
R:  You'd never guess Barnes and Noble would exist, uh -- uh -- te- -- when I was going through high school, I'd think, "Who would want to buy books, we have everything on air".  But, look, everybody's going in there drinking coffee and buying books.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so that there will be this -- I think always people will want to have something -- a hard copy where a human hand touches it, other than say, "Ciao, baby, here's -- Hi, How Are You", you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But -- but -- in -- yeah, emails you can contact everyone and give them -- it's a great tool I know, but it --
L:  It sure is.
R:  What did Frank Lloyd Wright say about TV, "Bubblegum for the eyes".
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  There you go.
R:  Yeah, there you go. [SIGH] Oh dear, I -- why don't we stay on the subject, okay.  A million dollars, what else could we talk about, a million dollars and our best friend, I mean, yeah, you could -- you could give half to your best friend, if you really liked them. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh.
L:  And I --
R:  They --
L:  -- think you're -- I think that I probably --
R:  And they could tal- --
L:  -- I think I'd pass on the million, actually.  I think I'd go with my best friend.
R:  Would you?
L:  Because I think your comment about quality of life really has --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- a lot to do with it --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- and how it is that we continue to lives our lives.
R:  Mhm.  But coul- couldn't, uh -- what about the best friend, they can talk to you, you can listen and make eye gestures -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and they have a half a -- they'd be mad at you if you tal- -- "Hey, uh, what did you do, half a million dollars, you don't want to give it to me?" [LAUGH] Um, these are all the scenarios, you know, I'm not saying you shouldn't do what you -- what you should do or what you shouldn't do.  But, um, it's a fascinating subject [MN] it's really about [LIPSMACK] what would you really do though, really, really, really do?  And you don't know until the money's sitting in front of you and the -- the -- the agreement or the contract.
L:  Yes.
R:  We really don't.
L:  I don't know that I could -- I just don't know if I could be in integrity and never --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- speak to him again, I really don't.
R:  No, you have to have, uh, verbal exchange and you'd want to do it, you'd want to talk.
L:  Yeah --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I'd want to ha- -- make sure that they were -- she was still in my life.
R:  Okay.  Important is- --
L:  And, you know, the million dollars, shoot, I'm going to make a million dollars on my own, I don't know how --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- yet, but -- [LAUGH]
R:  It's not a lot of money really.  It's -- it's ten -- a hundred thousand for probably -- what ten years and fifty thousand for twenty.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] But it's in one lump and, uh, you know, when I was younger a million was a big deal, now it's got to be ten million or -- probably, before you feel -- or more.
L:  Really set.
R:  Mhm.  And, um -- nah, you know, "So many things to polish, so little time" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] -- said the monk with a begging bowl and a loincloth, you know.  I think he has it all figured out, you know.  Less to polish, do human service, concentrate on your inner self, you know.  Be in be- --
L:  Well, in -- in the million dollars, you know, the best friend, I think, would -- would add more to that than --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- the cash.
R:  It depends how much time --
