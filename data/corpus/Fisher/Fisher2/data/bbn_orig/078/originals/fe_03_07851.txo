L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, my name is Maxine.
R:  I -- my name is Gretchen.
L:  I'm calling from West Virginia.
R:  Okay, I'm in Indiana.
L:  Okay.  I'm thirty eight.
R:  I'm thirty one. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  Wow, well, gosh, wouldn't that be nice, you had your own money just to be able to [LAUGH] open up a business?
L:  Yeah, what type would you open?
R:  I -- you know, I don't [SIGH] -- I guess it'd be a toss up.  I think it'd be neat, of course, to have a gift shop or c- you know, your own clothing or, gosh, really any -- there'd be so many -- when money's not an issue it makes it a little bit wider range.
L:  I tell ya something I've always dreamed of that I'd like to have, because at one time I was real heavy, I used to weigh like, two hundred and eight pounds and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- uh, this has been like, uh, fifteen years ago, when I went to Physicians' Weight Loss Center.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And if money was no object I would like to have something like that, some form of, uh -- I lost a hundred and seventeen pounds in --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- six months.
R:  Wow, that's a lot.
L:  And I've -- I've managed to +keep it o- -- keep it off by exercise --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and just watching what I eat and it's been like, fifteen years and, uh, I'd like to have something like that and even --
R:  Well that's a g- big accomplishment.
L:  Thank you.  And it's something that I figure, you know, uh, a lotta people, you know, a lotta these places have these, uh, places and it costs so much.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And if money wasn't an option --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, I would like to be able to help the ones, you know, that couldn't afford it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because I'm sure a lotta people see these ads like Jenny Craig and all these things and they just couldn't afford, you know, to do it.
R:  Right.  And there is, there's a lot of 'em out there now.
L:  Yeah.  And then maybe after you help them and then like, you know, you have to buy your own foods and stuff like that and it's expensive, maybe give 'em like, a discount or -- and then after they lose their weight the -- I'd like to have like, an exercise place where they could, you know, maintain.
R:  Yeah.  That -- that would be neat.  I mean, like you say, there is a lot of people that -- and it is, everything is so outrageously priced for everything.  I -- I -- it's hard to sit and think of something, I mean, I always thought it'd be neat to own, um, you know, a little store, as long as at this time and age though, I mean, like a gift shop or a clothing store I think would be -- wouldn't probably do so well [LAUGH] right now.  But my mom has always, um, thought it'd be neat to open a, like a health food store that had a lot of, more like a -- one that had a bunch of organic, you know, produce and things because a --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- a lot of, um, around here we have health food stores but like you say, they're all so very expensive --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, most of 'em have vitamins and stuff but you really can't find that much of the food and produce and stuff, and I don't know how well it would go over.  I know there is a lot of people in -- especially now there is a lot more that are, you know, buying organic products --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- compared to what there used to be 'cause there's -- you know, they don't have any of the pesticides or anything, and, uh, but I think you also have to watch what, uh -- you'd have to see your turnover because with -- when you're dealing with fresh foods a lotta times, you know, if you don't have a high demand you're gonna have, you know, a lot of it wasted, which you don't want.  But there's so many options [LAUGH], you know, out there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.  And there's a lot of people that have, you know, home based products and stuff too that, you know, if you had the store or whatever you could put anything --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as far as that.  But yeah, I -- I, uh, I -- I like Christmas a lot and I always thought it'd be kinda neat too if you could have a seasonal type, you know, store that you could -- like you say, it -- it's just a whole different outlook when you're, you know, money isn't an option here! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, goodness.
L:  That's why I said, you know, that if it was no option, my concern would be like if it would mean that I would already be rich and just, you know, was out to help someone, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I would go after the people just like even, um, like these people that are extremely heavy, like four and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- five hundred pounds like --
R:  They've gotta be so uncomforter- uncomfortable.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean --
L:  You know, they have these things like these bariatric treatment centers --
R:  Yes, I've seen those.
L:  -- and the people just can't afford --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, to go have surgery and stuff like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  And I mean, if there was a means that you could, uh, you know, do that to help someone or I mean maybe some kind of program that you could even like, tip the cost in half or --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- whatever, you know, just to give 'em like a new lease on life because, you know, I've got a friend, she weighs way up there like in maybe four or five hundred pounds and she's only like, thirty one or thirty two and she's really miserable.
R:  Yeah, you would have to be.  I mean, even just -- I imagine you get tired real easy and ... yeah, and the thing is, with something like that, that type of a business actually -- you -- it doesn't matter what your -- you know, you're -- that type of business you're gonna be selling it year round.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, you're gonna have people always, you know, in there, no matter what.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So yeah, that's -- that's not -- it is -- i- wouldn't it just be nice to just actually be able to have so much money that you could just dish it out here and there to people that needed it, or just go buy 'em stuff and give it to 'em!
L:  Yeah, or like you said, open up something and someone come in there that didn't have anything, just say, "Hey, get what you want".
R:  Oh, that would be so nice, I mean --
L:  Yeah, you know.
R:  It is, it's -- it's so sad and especially it's, I guess, even more sad around like, the holidays 'cause, you know, when there's the children and people that don't, you know, can't afford to even give their kid, you know, one Christmas present or something it's --
L:  I know, it was --
R:  -- so sad.
L:  -- around Christmas time a couple of years ago and I was in the Kmart store and -- and you know how the rush is right around Christmas time and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- uh, I was walking through there and I found this fifty dollar bill laying on the floor.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And instead of being excited about it, it really upset me.
R:  You knew it was someone else and they probably needed it.
L:  Exactly.  I mean, it depressed me, I wished I hadn't even -- I hadn't even found it because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it kept burning on my mind, you know, what if that was some -- you know how kids are bad to hold their money in their hands?
R:  Right.
L:  What if that was some child and that was all they had for Christmas.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, yeah.
L:  And, you know, it really bea- -- well, I mean, it's been a few years ago and it still bears on my mind, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because, you know, I just ... I'd rather give someone something than to take something, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I wouldn't -- but it really bothered me because --
R:  In this day and age it, you know, it's so hard because people that do have businesses really can't, you know, afford to give, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as much too because they're trying to make a living and with times that are hard it makes it harder, you know, for everybody.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I, you know, and as far as I guess we're supposed to talk about how you'd go about it, I mean, I don't know, I guess the first -- if money wasn't an option you would look for place, you know, your place to put it.  I mean ...
L:  Well have you worked in retail before, like that with clothing and stuff?
R:  Oh, when I was a teenager I, you know, I had worked in a clothing store and it would, you know, it'd be -- I thought it would always be neat but I, you know, you kinda weigh it too, it would kinda be neat to have -- we have a -- a store -- a couple of stores here and they just have, um, really nice, um, all different kinds of, you know, things, like some purses, kinda like a -- a -- a -- not really a boutique because they do have more, I mean, they even have some stuffed animals and some little --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- oh, you know, of course, when, you know, when everybody's into like, lighthouses and sailboats and things like that and --
L:  Well you take --
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] different neat things.
L:  -- you take these stores though, they have, uh, it's, uh, fifty or a hundred percent mark up really --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- because I -- I worked in retail -- right now I work in construction --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but before I -- I've been in construction for ten years, before I worked in the retail business I managed stores like, for individual owners and everything.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And they would like, buy, you know, like these Tommy Hilfiger jeans or Guess, and if they paid twenty five dollars a pair for 'em, uh, we marked 'em up to like, sixty nine ninety nine.
R:  Wow.  Isn't it -- that's amazing.
L:  Yeah.  And then see, they mark 'em up so much that like, you know, when they have -- you -- you see these stores that have these blowout sales and they'll say like, "Thirty to forty percent off".
R:  But they're still making their profit too on top of that.
L:  Exactly.  See, they --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- can even cut theirs down to sixty percent and they're still breaking even.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because, I mean, like I said, I've worked that, I know how the system runs, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So anytime you -- you see these name brands, unless you can go to an outlet, uh --
R:  Right.
L:  You know, like Tommy or, uh --
R:  And we do have an outlet by here where we live.  It's not -- it's a small one but it's not that far, but they do have a Tommy Hilfiger outlet [inaudible] store.
L:  That's your best bet, any of these --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- outlet stores because you can say you're getting your money's worth there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But all these other stores -- and there is like, uh, stores around here that's called Gabriel Brothers.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Have you ever heard of that?
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  And they have like, name brand stuff.  It's a variety like all that stuff, it's a mixture of everything like a big old huge Walmart.
R:  Wow.
L:  And they even have name brand like Tommy Hilfiger and Guess and Polo --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and all that, and --
R:  See, that would be ultimate, if you could actually own your own, I guess your own franchise of an outlet.
L:  Yes.
R:  That would be okay because then, you know, you would [SIGH] -- you'd still be making -- I -- 'cause I know versus the jeans here versus down at like, we have LS Airs which is like, um, a Marshall Fields or something in that, you know, range of the big department store, and you can almost -- their jeans would sell like, fifty to sixty bucks and here you can get 'em thirty to thirty five but sometimes they're --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- on sale, you can get, I mean, they're twenty five bucks.  So you're talking half --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- half price.
L:  And even this store, Gabriel's, it would have certain racks that like, after they had just -- like, some of the clothes would have just like a mi- -- a little minor --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- flaw.
R:  A flaw or something, hm.
L:  And I found a pair of Calvin Kleins one day and it was just luck, for one dollar.
R:  Wow.
L:  And there wasn't anything wrong with them, and it was just on this big old rack and I -- I mean, you know, it takes a little bit of time --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you just got to dig and dig and dig --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and just like when
