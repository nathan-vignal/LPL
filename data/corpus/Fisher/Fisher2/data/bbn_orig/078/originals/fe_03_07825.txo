R:  [COUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Hello, my name is Amanda. [NOISE]
R:  Hello, my name is Carol.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And I -- I'm not sure how this is working but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I was told to speak so I guess we'd better talk.
L:  We'd better talk. [SIGH]
R:  And the question is, uh, would you leave US if you were given a -- a million dollars and I certainly would.  I --
L:  W- [MN] --
R:  -- cer- -- and never return.  I certainly would be happy to do that.
L:  And where would you go?
R:  Oh, many countries.  Anywhere in Great Britain, Germany, Scandanavia.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, well, the money might not go as far in France, and, um, actually, any of those countries --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, I'm scanning the globe now, mentally --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and, uh, Australia of course.  New Zealand.  I would love to live in New Zealand.
L:  And would you miss being in the US?  What would you miss about it?
R:  Nothing.
L:  Nothing? [LAUGH]
R:  I was- -- I mean, uh, uh, well, okay --
L:  Well, you know --
R:  -- what would you miss?
L:  -- I agree with you, I would definitely leave the US [LAUGH] for that much money.  Um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I know exactly where I'd go --
R:  Where would you go?
L:  -- which is to Paris.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And --
R:  You might just have to stretch the money a bit there, see I've thought about --
L:  Oh, I could do it.
R:  Okay.
L:  I could do it. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  It's, um, my favorite city in the world.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, I would miss the US.  I would miss, um, a lot of things that we, I think, take for granted as, uh, citizens in the United States.  Um, we have a lot of more freedoms I think than we think about on a daily basis.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] for instance, do you know that in France you are guilty until proven innocent?
R:  Mhm.  That's a --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- Napoleonic -- well, mhm.
L:  Yeah, they haven't, uh, gotten rid of that yet, so --
R:  Mhm, [MN] --
L:  -- that would be --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- one consideration.
R:  That's the same in Mexico and, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, you know, those things, um, [LIPSMACK] things such as that, things that are in our constitution that, you know, I know there's a lot in our constitution that's not really, uh, up to date, or doesn't seem to apply to the -- to today's times but there's a lot that prote- protects us also, we do have a lot of freedom, so I guess I would miss that.  Uh --
R:  Well, that one thing that you mentioned, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] actually, I know, uh, with a million dollars, um, you could buy a very good lawyer [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- if you ever got into any kind of trouble in France.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, um, a person like myself, I don't imagine getting into any kind of trouble with, uh, with the law.
L:  Oh, right! [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, mi- minor infringements maybe --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- traffic or something but, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Uh, actually that doesn't bother me a bit, uh, really I think they have very good, uh, system of law.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I'd be really happy living in France, and I'd be very careful with my money and try to make it last.
L:  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK] Well, I thi- --
R:  As a million dollars is not what a million dollars used to be.
L:  Right.  But I think you could pr- live -- well, you could live comfortably on a million dollars.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, in a lot of places.
R:  Maybe not right in Paris.  I don't know.  But certainly in the countryside.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Lovely -- lovely town.  And also, my goodness, all of Great Britain.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  Be -- it would be just -- just wonderful really.  There's so much that I like, uh, when I visit there.  I feel more at home there than I do -- I'm in Los Angeles, in Los A- -- in a section in Los Angeles --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  There, uh, people are more polite and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, caring and, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- sections of, uh, Los Angeles, where I live, uh, some of my d- day to day excursions out shopping and, uh, I walk quite a bit, um, [LIPSMACK] I feel like I'm in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a foreign country, people, um, do not speak English --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, uh, do not want to speak to me and only want to keep to their --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- own culture, which of course is their right but it makes me feel very isolated.
L:  Yeah.  I wouldn't --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- miss that so much about the US as, um --
R:  Mhm,
L:  -- [NOISE] I feel like even though it's such a diverse country as far as we, you know, have so many different representations of races and cultures --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I really feel like, especially in these times, people are starting to, uh, stick to their own, if you will.
R:  D- I find that definitely here in the middle of the Los Angeles.
L:  Mhm.  It seems to be in the bigger cities.
R:  In that I'm an older person, um, and I'm fifty and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I would like to go to groups and [MN] there's no place I can go.  I can go to a worship service and then just go home but there are no groups for my -- for my age, uh, for single women.
L:  Right.  And I think in nu- --
R:  There are -- there's nothing in Los Angeles.  There are groups, um, I live near, um, a very i- immigrant, uh, community and they have their own groups of which I am -- I'm sort of envious at their camaraderie and their love for each other just because they happen to be, say, Russian.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They greet each other and, um, meet each other and speak Russian and I can see the, you know, the joy in their faces, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- here I am, I'm an, um, [LIPSMACK] an American, my family was here before the American revolution and fought in every war, although that's got nothing to do with the subject --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it's -- it's the fact that I feel isolated as an American, as a several generation American.  I feel lonely as a widow and a woman who's only, uh, fifty.  And I feel very isolated and lonely in my own country.  So I -- I have felt much more at home in Great Britain, Scandanavia, oh, I would love, even despite the cold, cold weather in Scandanavia in the winters.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I could put up with that very well.  I -- Scandinavian people, uh, Denmark are just -- have been so kind to me, I would love to live anywhere in Scandanavia.
L:  [LIPSMACK] So this opportunity would be very freeing for you.
R:  Oh, I would be elated.  It would be the best thing that ever happened to me, second to having my -- my daughter.
L:  Well, I was --
R:  And my -- my life with my daughter.
L:  -- just about to ask you, what about, um, if you had to leave and never come back, [SIGH] that would kinda limit how much --
R:  She'd go with m- --
L:  Oh --
R:  I think my daughter would go with me.
L:  Oh yeah?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  She's not -- she's not married. [LIPSMACK]
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah, oh --
L:  'Cause she could go get married over there.
R:  That would --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That would be a contingency.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  That would be.  And, um --
L:  See that's --
R:  Yes.
L:  I would definitely miss -- I have a lot of family here, very, very big Italian family and, um --
R:  Well, they could come visit you in--
L:  [MN]
R:  -- uh, Paris.
L:  They could co- -- they could come visit.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But it would be hard, it's a little harder to travel, you know, internationally than [SIGH] -- than to, um, [SIGH] you know, just drive --
R:  And you have --
L:  -- a couple of states over. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  Do you have children?
L:  [SIGH] I have one child.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So that would also -- but, uh, on the same token I -- I would trade f- -- uh, my life as an American for my life as, I guess an immigrant in another country just because I feel like he would be exposed --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to a lot more of the world, I think Americans are --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- becoming more and more closed off and --
R:  What I've read of the French, uh, school system, it -- it is wonderful.
L:  Oh, it is.  My husband actually --
R:  It is far superior.
L:  My husband, uh, studied at the Sorbonne.
R:  Oh.
L:  And --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it --
R:  I mean -- I mean even the --
L:  And it's just like our playground.
R:  -- the -- even the little elementary schools I've s- -- I've read and seen documentaries of how good it is, whereas here, uh, once again in a big city like Los Angeles --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I would -- I never sent my daughter to a public school, even though my daughter is -- is now thirty eight years old --
L:  My son --
R:  That many years ago --
L:  Yeah.
R:  She could not go to a public school.  W- --
L:  My son would not go to a public --
R:  Mhm.
L:  He won't got to a --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- public school.  Granted he's only six months old.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But when it is time for, um, him to be in school --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] we'll have to pay for an education for him so that it'll be better and so that he'll understand more the importance of a good education.  I think, that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- young people these days are -- are so consumed by j- um, all the [LIPSMACK] entertainment o- o- of our western culture and more so than, you know, government politics.
R:  Yes.
L:  Um, e- education, even their own education I don't think is quite as valued.  It's more, so, get an education to get a job than get an education to be educated, to be, uh, more worldly.
R:  Do you know, everything is so expensive you have to --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- think of -- as -- as a mother of a daughter who was, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- well, she has a -- a masters degree but it's in, uh, [COUGH] computers.
L:  Mhm.
R:  She had to think of getting an education to support herself.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And she barely makes it, supporting herself.
L:  And do you know --
R:  And that -- I'm afraid that's the way America has come to be.
L:  It really has unfortunately.  Both my husband and I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- have [SIGH] college educations.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I o- hold a masters and he holds a bachelors degree, however, he is --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- an IT professional, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  We make, you know, a -- a good living --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- every year and, uh, [LIPSMACK] unfortunately it doesn't get us very far.
R:  Right.
L:  Um [LIPSMACK], however, y- you know, I guess you have to -- you have to make your own life, you have to make your own way and --
R:  Mhm.
