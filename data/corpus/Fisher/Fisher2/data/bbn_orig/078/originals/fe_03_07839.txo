R:  Wherever you are, right?
L:  Yeah, I mean, I wanna do it for like, uh, entertainment. [NOISE] 
R:  Mhm.

R:  That's true.  You would have to go but not live there, that's [LAUGH] true.
L:  Exactly. [LAUGH]  A few vacations.
R:  Just visit, right?  And make your money and come home.  That's true.
L:  There you go. [LAUGH]  So, yeah.
R:  That's interesting, a reporter.  So you like to write a lot then too?
L:  Yeah, I do.
R:  And -- and -- of interesting --
L:  I -- I like to --
R:  -- topics and different things?
L:  Yeah, I was, um, in journalism when I was in high school.
R:  I was gonna say, you have your own little journal --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- book that you're always writing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- stuff in, right?
L:  Yeah, and --
R:  Yeah, that's [several inaudible words], yeah.
L:  Yeah, so it's just always been something fun.
R:  That's really interesting.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  Being a reporter is interesting.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  There was one lady on TV -- I can't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- remember her name and everybody kept saying, "How can you stand --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- that thing in your ear?" and she said, "I really --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- don't know it's there!" [LAUGH]
L:  Really? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess 'cause she's so wrapped up in her job, she's so interested --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in what she's doing --
L:  Yeah, yes.
R:  -- um, it -- there's so many things that are coming at ya.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [inaudible] you know all the interesting things that's happening at the time.  And she said, "Gee, I really don't notice that thing in my ear!" it was funny --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I'll never forget that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But --
L:  And it's true too, I mean [MN]--
R:  Yeah, 'cause it, you know, you always have that thing in your ear, you're wondering, it's just like an operator, you say, "Wow, how can they stand that on their head all day?" right? [NOISE]
L:  I know.
R:  And with every --
L:  Oh man!
R:  -- caller that calls and you gotta take care of business you're not worrying about --
L:  You don't notice the --
R:  -- the thing on your head, right?
L:  Yeah, you don't notice it's there.
R:  That's like you, right?
L:  [NOISE] Yes.  E- exactly.
R:  You don't notice that thing on your head.
L:  [NOISE] No.  [LAUGH] Not at all.
R:  What got you involved in this issue study?  It's interesting. [NOISE]
L:  Um, I was actually online and a friend suggested it to me.
R:  You do what?
L:  I was online and a friend suggested it to me, so I was --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- like, well -- well, that sounds cool, you know.
R:  It sounds really interesting, doesn't it?
L:  Huh? [NOISE]
R:  It sounds interesting, doesn't it?
L:  Yeah.  Is this your first call or your third, did you say?
R:  Third.
L:  Third?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And this -- so this is your last call?
R:  No, why?
L:  Well, 'cause I thought you only get three?
R:  Oh no, you have to put your PIN number in.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You have to know how to work the system.
L:  Yeah, okay.
R:  Just call the eight hundred number, put your PIN number in.
L:  So is that what you did today?
R:  Yeah.  That's how you get calls.  That's -- that way they'll call you when you wanna accept calls, you know?
L:  Oh really?
R:  And you're more interested and in the mood to speak, you know, on the level that you're supposed to speak about, right?
L:  Uh-huh, yeah.
R:  It makes more sense.
L:  Yeah.
R:  If I just sit home and they just ring the phone it's like, okay I'll take the call but am I really focusing on the subject?
L:  Exactly, that's true, that's true.
R:  You see, that's why I do it this way.
L:  And is it -- is it twenty minutes we talk or ...?
R:  Ten minutes.
L:  Ten?
R:  Just ten minutes, yeah.
L:  And it's just one person you talk to?
R:  Yeah, it's j- -- each one's ten minutes.
L:  Oh.
R:  But it'll end when it ends and then we have to say goodbye.  Hopefully I could speak again to you sometime.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  I don't know how you can do that, if you can request anybody or if you can request somebody.
L:  I don't even know my number, do you know yours?
R:  You don't know your PIN number?
L:  I -- I do, it's in my email but I'm -- I'm not by a computer right now so I don't know it by heart.
R:  I have mine [NOISE], it's two two five eight four.
L:  Two two five eight four?
R:  Yeah, that's my PIN number.
L:  I'll write that down and maybe if we can I'll just, you know.
R:  Yeah, maybe you can. [NOISE]
L:  Two two five eight four.
R:  Five eight four, yeah.
L:  Okay, let's talk.  Phew.
R:  [LAUGH] What you do is, you just put your PIN number i- -- you just dial the eight hundred number, put your PIN number in and then --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they fish for somebody, that's why it's called the Fisher Study.
L:  Oh, all right.
R:  Fish for people! [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, well that's cool.
R:  It's really appropriate!
L:  I didn't know you could do that, I thought you had to wait till they called you, [NOISE] so I was like, uh --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But wouldn't --
R:  Live and learn. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well thanks for the advice. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You're welcome.  [MN]
L:  Oh.
R:  Might as well get all you can out of the study
