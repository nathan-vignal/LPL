L:  Good morning, or I guess it's afternoon maybe where you are --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Margaret from Salem, Oregon.
R:  Hi, yes, actually I'm four hours ahead --
L:  Four hours ahead?
R:  I'm in New York.
L:  Where are --
R:  I --
L:  -- you at?
R:  I'm in New York in Brooklyn, to be specific.
L:  Oh wow, east --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- coaster.
R:  I am at present although I do live in Los Angeles, and I actually have a colleague, with whom I visit occasionally, that lives not far from you -- north of you in, um, uh, Redmond in Washington.  So, where --
L:  Oh, yeah.  Redmond, Washington's way cool.
R:  Yeah, she works --
L:  That's where --
R:  -- for King Bill.
L:  Uh --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I was just going to say that's where Bill lives.
R:  Yes.
L:  So --
R:  She actually used to be the owner of a company, uh, for which I used to do graphic design in Orange County.
L:  Uh, way cool.
R:  And, um -- yeah --
L:  So, would you start your own business?
R:  Uh, actually I have recently, uh, up until last year I had my own two businesses.  Um, a publishing company and a graphic design firm myself.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, Los Angeles, uh -- for about fifteen years that I had the publishing business and the final five years of it I had my graphic design business [NOISE] and then I got tired of it all and decided that I wanted to finish some books that some, uh, publishers wanted --
L:  You mean you're a writer?
R:  -- so I stopped all of it.  I am.
L:  So, you're an author?
R:  Uh, sometimes. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, one book makes you an author I guess, huh?
R:  I suppose.
L:  [LAUGH] Would you start up a new one, a different one?
R:  Uh, publishing, no. [NOISE] Uh, after fifteen years of that, um, I have no formal training whatsoever and I -- in fact I started out as a teenager --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- and, um -- and now that I'm in my mid thirties I have about three things I want to do, which is travel and drink and write --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and I do all of those very well and have been doing them since I were a youth   So --
L:  Well, you could travel and write travel books.
R:  Well, um, in a way I do although not much travelogues as I do, um -- when I was in Los Angeles I actually had a published, uh, series called Los Angeles Downtown Diaries.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Now, I'm actually going to do a very small and exclusive item, um, that I'm going to put out, uh, either handwritten or on a typer[?] [NOISE] um, and photocopy it, uh, for the time being, uh, for the fact of, um, uh -- for the immediate gratification that it brings, called Now I'm In New York or it's acronym NIINY[?].
L:  Or what?
R:  NIINY --
L:  Is that --
R:  Now I'm in New York.
L:  Oh, Now I'm in New York.
R:  Yes, and NIINY.  In other words --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's just a, uh -- a compulsive move --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- in such a way to where it just seems silly, almost daft --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but at the same time, quite adventuresome.
L:  Yeah, it sounds really adventuresome.
R:  [NOISE] So --
L:  I -- I would love to start my own business and I would grow --
R:  I --
L:  -- h- herbs and exotic plants.
R:  I can tell you there's nothing that is stopping you. [NOISE]
L:  I know -- well money.
R:  [NOISE] Not even that.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  When I started out I had no money whatever, [NOISE] I had no funding, [NOISE] um, I had no home, I was living out of a suitcase and I simply did it. [NOISE] And I've done that with pretty much everything I've done, audio engineering, typography, graphic design, publishing, writing, all of that.  I have no --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- formal schooling, I have no funding, I mean, even if now, uh, while I do have places where I live in both Brooklyn and Los Angeles, [NOISE] I really don't even have a mailing address, which I prefer [NOISE] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because it allows me, um, a strange irresponsibility [NOISE] that allows me to just walk and drink and write as I desire. [NOISE]
L:  There you go.
R:  So ... [NOISE]
L:  You have everything then, it sounds like?
R:  I have everything and nothing.
L:  There you go.
R:  And I rather like that. [NOISE]
L:  And that -- that is so much against the American way.
R:  Well, no, I think that that is the American way --
L:  Really?
R:  Uh --
L:  Not in my --
R:  -- because it is -- because it's my own -- it's my personal definit- -- it's my definition, I should say, of freedom.
L:  Right.
R:  I -- I have owned a home, I've been married, [NOISE] I've lived all over the world, [NOISE] you know, I've been offered all sorts of chances at college, in the military [NOISE] and all of that [NOISE] --
L:  It is --
R:  -- but I would rather observe --
L:  -- freedom, I never --
R:  -- the dynamic that life offers --
L:  Right.
R:  -- which is doing whatever the hell is somewhat compulsive -- impulsive --
L:  Right.  I've a friend --
R:  -- and --
L:  -- that just started his own business just this week, just, like, two days ago.
R:  Well, there you go.
L:  And he's, uh, somewhat of a graphic artist, he's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- making signs, vinyl --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- signs and stuff so --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- he is somewhat of a graphic artist and he's been at it for two days and he's already got business and everything and it --
R:  Well, there you go it's just a matter of going out and, uh, making oneself, uh, observed [NOISE] and --
L:  And there's a lot -- there's a lot of ways for, like, females -- single females --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, of a certain age and a certain low income that can get lots of money from the government to start up their own business too.
R:  [NOISE] Yes, the thing of it is, one has to realize that it -- whatever it takes.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, if you, uh -- if you're familiar with say, even as strange as it may be, um, the underlying, uh, motives are, um, imp- implications of even Marquis de Sade or Sun Tzu --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- uh, both of whom were banned writers in their time in their countries, one just has to go out and do it because [NOISE] to be, uh, quite blunt, uh, when you get on your death bed and you look back on what -- on what you've done, do you want to regret it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or do you want to be able to be satisfied with what you've done? [NOISE]
L:  Right.
R:  And nobody's going to give it to you, you just have to take it.
L:  Right, right.
R:  It's literally that much. [NOISE]
L:  I'm quite the gardener now, I've got all kinds of herbs and exotic plants to grow and I'm a manager at a department complex --
R:  [NOISE] Well --
L:  -- and I take --
R:  -- what the hell are you waiting for?  The thing of it is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- yeah, it's -- it's just like that, um, uh, Phoenician complex, you have to, uh [NOISE] -- what can I say, you have to destroy that which you had before in order to grow that which you're going to have ahead of you --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- you know.
L:  Yep.
R:  In order to rise from the ashes you have to burn the -- burn the past.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Right.  And a lot of it has to do with, uh, my, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for -- personally for me it's a lot of insecurities and stuff --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know.
R:  But everybody has that. [NOISE]
L:  Right, I realize that.
R:  Yeah, in fact the people who usually are, um, up there, as I, uh -- I realized when I were a, uh, um -- [LIPSMACK] a teenager in the military, [NOISE] uh, when I was on my way to Colorado Springs, Colorado and decided that I didn't want that.  I was surrounded by people that I thought were very strong, who were wrought with insecurity, some of whom went on to the military academy and dropped out within a week or so.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Everybody is fraught with --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- insecurity.
L:  Yeah.
R:  However, uh, the best thing to do is use that as an engine rather than an impediment.
L:  Right, that's what my counselor told me --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- but -- that, you know -- that's words to live by but, you know, [NOISE] it's [NOISE] forty six years of be- --
R:  You just have to go out and do it, you have to -- you have to understand the dynamic of life is that you're going to fail at times --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and not worry about it and on top of that the worst -- what is worse than failure, is not failing, because you don't do anything.
L:  Does it take a lot of research and stuff to start your own business or do you just, like, jump right into it?
R:  Uh, that I can't advise but I have never done any research whatever.
L:  Like, no marketing research to see if --
R:  No.
L:  -- where you're -- what's open in your --
R:  Everything that I -- everything that I did I simply did and, um -- like -- like I said, when I started out doing -- uh, what was the longest endeavor that I incurred, uh, fifteen years of publishing.  Um, it started out as a very small handwritten music fanzine at ten copies --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- and by the time I stopped it was, uh, tens of thousands, worldwide, internationally distributed, at just about every book stores both Tower and many music stores worldwide.
L:  Oh.
R:  All by --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- myself I had three offices, one in downtown Los Angeles, one on Wilcox, um, in Hollywood between, [LIPSMACK] uh, Sunset and Hollywood and one --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that I -- even to this day --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- retain for writing --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- in, um, [LIPSMACK] uh, Topanga Canyon.
L:  How did you do it with no money though?
R:  Because I started small and I simply built it up in the same way that I'm doing right now, which is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to save money and to work and make money --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- and to, on top of that -- to simply endure the, um -- the process, uh, whether it's -- it- it's being homeless, whether it's being groundless --
L:  Right.
R:  -- whatever the hell it is --
L:  Right, um --
R:  -- it doesn't matter because the thing that is -- it has one thing --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- to do which is just getting to earn what one wants regardless of what is going on.
L:  Right.  I've often -- I've often thought about, uh, maybe a way to start making some money --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for a little plant business is to --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- uh, write a book on how to take care of plants and then make a little bit of money from that to start the plant --
R:  You could do that and on top of that what you could -- what you could do is just -- in the way -- the same way that I explained, start locally --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you can produce a small book -- I mean, for a few hundred dollars -- you already have a computer, I imagine?  You can get a --
L:  No, I don't.
R:  Oh, for -- well, for less than a thousand dollars you can get a really good printer, twelve hundred D.P.I. true --
L:  Right.
R:  -- as well as all of that get some really good paper, um, learn how the computer characteristics are, print your own book, learn to do book binding and on top of that, advertise locally.
L:  Right.
R:  And advertise via guerilla marketing.  Putting flyers out, word of mouth, uh, if you have free listings online, on top of that you can build your own small and, uh, very, uh, expedient website regarding what you do.  Put that out everywhere, I mean, just make stickers with just your URL, uh --
L:  What's a URL?
R:  Uh, universal, uh -- well it's basically your address, your web address.
L:  Oh okay.  My sister has a website --
