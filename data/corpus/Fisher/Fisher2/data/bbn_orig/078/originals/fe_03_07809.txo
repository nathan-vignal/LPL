L:  Hi, my name is Sue.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?
R:  Can you hear me, Sue?
L:  Yes.  
R:  Sorry about [LAUGH] that.  I'm at a pay phone so, uh ...  I'm Kelvin from Los Angeles, actually in Long Beach.  Where are you from, Sue?
L:  Oh, San Diego.  
R:  Oh, not too far away.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  I hope you have sunshine.
L:  We do not.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, well we have June gloom too.  
L:  Oh, oh, west coast.
R:  Perjury.  Uh, uh, well.  [MN]  I guess it depends on what the crime or other item is, you know.  Obviously, I --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- wouldn't do anything for a felony or something but sometimes I think you have to, especially, um, if you want to -- um, I guess, perjury is a legal term so it would be a court case but, uh ...
L:  That -- that would be my -- my problem with it.  Is that if it -- if it were in fact perjury, what they're indicating is that you're sitting -- you're sitting on a witness stand and much as I would find it very difficult to -- to put a family member or a close friend in jeopardy I don't think it serves anybodies purpose to put both of us in jeopardy, and I think I would -- I would not be able to commit perjury even in that circumstance.
R:  Right.  As -- as opposed to a white lie or something when you're trying to -- to, uh, well, not hurt a family member in terms of, you know, maybe a relationship [MN] [SIGH] you came across or something like that, you know.
L:  Yeah, it -- it -- it's difficult.  I mean, [MN] while you talk about family relationships and damaging family relationship, it's interesting because, uh, coming from Los Angeles I suspect you're familiar with the Westerfield case down here.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  Uh, I have a co worker who -- he and I had a -- a running argument.  He was shocked that in that trial Westerfield's family [MN] testified against him in providing the information that he had gotten weird with their young daughters and this fellow was -- was shocked that his family could and would do that.  And he said there's no way he could go against family in that --
R:  Well --
L:  -- fashion.  And I was appalled that here he would [MN] sacrifice protecting family from supporting someone who has done something wrong.
R:  Right.  
L:  And I -- I don't see any, uh, I don't see any way that that makes sense.  
R:  Well, that's, uh, you know, the Unibomber's family, uh, or brother, I think, turned him in.
L:  Right.  Exactly.  
R:  And as it --
L:  And --
R:  There's an interesting case in Boston now where, um, I think the president of the University of Massachussetts just went before congress because his brother is a [LAUGH] well known gangster.  
L:  Oh, interesting.
R:  [MN]  Burger[?] or something and he has refused to say anything for, uh, oh, forty years but, uh, his brother disappeared, you know.  Like thirty or forty years ago.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, and he said, well, he got immunity to go before the, uh, uh, congress.  The, uh, committee th- that was investigating his brother who evidently murdered people and things and, uh, he said, well, I haven't been in touch with him.  I haven't talked to him and, uh, I didn't support him or send him money or what have you.  And I kind of thought that's kind of funny.  Why did he need immunity to get that if that was the truth?  I would've just gone up anyway in the beginning, you know, and said exactly those same things but, uh ...
L:  Hm.
R:  It's [MN] --
L:  It's interesting 'cause yes, the -- the -- having granted him immunity it immediately makes you think that he has done something --
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  -- wrong --
R:  -- by refusing --
L:  -- that he needed immunity.
R:  -- over the many years, you know, to say anything to the public and they want to, uh, kick him out as the president of the [LAUGH] University of Massachussetts or something like that but ...  It's kind --
L:  Interesting.
R:  -- of [inaudible] but, uh ...  No, I think you're right.  Uh, um, I don't really know.  They should give us the legal definition of perjury.  I guess it's lying under oath or something
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Something of that nature but, uh, uh, I guess, uh, Bill Clinton perjured --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- himself.  [LAUGH]  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But from my point of view --
L:  But it wasn't really sex.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, well it -- it -- [MN]  [LAUGH]  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean, uh, [inaudible] --
L:  Well, and I think actually I think you've brought up an excellent example because I understand that the incidence of oral sex among teenagers has increased dramatically in the last two or three years, and my guess is that it's the result of Clinton's [LAUGH] perjury.
R:  Well ...
L:  That he said this is okay.  This doesn't count.  And they took the President's word for it.  
R:  And there's no +pregnanc- pregnancy involved.  No -- no, uh, you know, child and so forth but, uh ...  It's -- it's a hard -- it's a hard case and I -- I think, uh, um, of course it depends on what the situation is, you know.  [inaudible].
L:  Yeah.  I'm -- I -- I -- I'm not sure that I'm gonna buy that one, Kelvin.
R:  No.  You have an --
L:  I think we're --
R:  -- absolute standard?
L:  Well, I think where morals and ethics come into play, I do think that there are some absolute standards that need to be maintained or as a society we -- I -- I don't believe we have any future.  And I think those -- those morals and ethics come to -- come to play when you're talking about lying in criminal proceedings to essentially protect somebody who either has performed a crime or to, you know, as much as you can say, well, um, what if they didn't do anything but it might -- what I say is going to make them look guilty even though I know they're innocent?  What you've now done is you've subverted the justice system.  And either way I think that a society [MN] has got to be allowed to play through its rules.  And by -- by subverting those rules, either plus or minus, you still do overall long term damage to the society at large and I -- so I -- I do think that there are certain standards that we can't play fast and loose with.
R:  Well, I would love to [LAUGH] have George Bush and +Rumsfeld under oath -- subpoenaed under oath in congress and talk about the evidence, quote unquote, uh, for weapons of mass, uh, destruction.  Uh, uh ...  It seems to me that [MN] they shaded the truth and whether that's criminal or not, but, uh ...  Uh ...
L:  Well, but again that -- that's kind of off -- off the topic.  Whatever you -- whatever your political views are, plus or minus, I would [MN] up until the time that they are sworn in by a judge in a true criminal proceedings, um --
R:  Which -- uh, I -- I believe that --
L:  -- they're gonna say what they're gonna say.
R:  Clinton was in an impeachment case and that was definitely perjury, right?  Uh, [several inaudible words] kind of a ...
L:  Right he had been sworn in.
R:  Yeah.
L:  He did testify under oath.
R:  So -- I -- I know that some --
L:  I think that's very different than what a politician says.
R:  Well, I -- I know -- that's why I say I would like to see because, uh --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- some people talking about potential impeachment, uh, at least, you know, uh -- and -- and to see what they would say under those conditions.  [LAUGH]  It's -- it's a hard thing and I think many people do feel that their loyalty is to the family but I understand where you're from.  I, fortunately, have not had any problems personally with that situation.
L:  Well, I think -- I think it -- [MN] it's very easy for -- to have views when you haven't been confronted with the reality.  It becomes a little more difficult with the reality and we can only hope that we have the courage of our convictions in a circumstance like that.  
R:  Yeah, that's --
L:  [MN]  Do you --
R:  That's where this, uh, family case in, um, Massachussetts.  It would be quite interesting to see if something comes out of that.  I don't know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Do you feel that, uh, [MN] you would lie to protect your family?
R:  Uh, well, you know, uh, I'm talking about what people call white lies or something and, uh, it's very hard because, uh, for instance if you're in a situation where, um, a family member, you know that
