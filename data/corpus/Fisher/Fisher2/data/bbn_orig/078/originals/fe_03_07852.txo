L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  Hi, this is --
L:  H- --
R:  -- Patty.
L:  Hi, this is Julie.
R:  Hi, Julie. [LIPSMACK]
L:  You wanna go ahead or you want me to start?
R:  Um, well, I can start.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, I would probably definitely open my business, own business, and it would probably be a, uh, [LIPSMACK] probably a [LIPSMACK] probably a resale type shop.
L:  Mhm.
R:  To --
L:  What would you sell?
R:  Oh, just anything that maybe I picked up at auctions or garage sales or -- yeah, things like that, anything.
L:  Right.  How would you go about doing that?  Internet or?
R:  [MN] No, probably have my own -- my own store.
L:  Right, okay.
R:  And maybe -- maybe have an internet site because that would, uh, get some of the items out there.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Have your own website set up.
R:  Sure. [NOISE]
L:  A lotta people to -- at least you can see what you have at your shop at that.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right.
L:  Okay.  Well how much do you think that would cost to start up?
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  As far as buying the shop and --
R:  Oh my. [NOISE]
L:  -- all that.
R:  Lots. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah! [LAUGH]
R:  But money was no option right?
L:  Right.
R:  Okay.
L:  Well that's what they said huh?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's what they said.
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  Yeah, um, um, I'm not sure what kind of -- I know that I would definitely love to be in business for myself, my husband's military and I stay home with our children so --
R:  Oh okay.
L:  -- that's something we've talked about before.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, probably -- I mean, if money was no option, oh my, there's no telling.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Um, [LIPSMACK] uh, I'm not really, I didn't have enough time to think about it, as soon as -- as soon as I called in they connected me to you.
R:  I know, I know.
L:  So [LAUGH] --
R:  I know.  Yesterday's topic was, um, if you were offered a million dollars to leave the country, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So I was like, oh, well --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- maybe, maybe not. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  And then you talk about it and then you think, well, maybe I wouldn't, may- -- yeah, maybe I would. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  So, yeah, it's --
L:  Right.
R:  They don't give you enough time to think about --
L:  E- exactly.  [LIPSMACK] It's, uh, um, I don't know, probably, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't know.  Um, oh, maybe an antique store or something like that, I love --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- to go to antique shops.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That would be -- that'd be really nice, to have an antique store.  I'd buy from all over the world if money was no option. [LAUGH]
R:  Right. [NOISE]  Right.
L:  That'd be wonderful.
R:  Right.
L:  But, uh, yeah, that'd be quite a chunk of change to do that.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  So --
R:  That's why I picked what I picked because I like doing garage sales.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, having a garage sale.
L:  Right.
R:  And most people don't like that.
L:  Right.
R:  But I could even have people, you know, let me garage sale their stuff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.
L:  Well where are you located at?
R:  Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh, well, that'd be a good place --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- to have a -- a little shop --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like that.  I'm from, uh, West Virginia --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- originally.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So I know there's a lot of antique --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- stores and just little flea market type deals and stuff like that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that you could go and shop around at.
R:  Right.
L:  That would be nice.
R:  And the Amish people and, you know, that type of -- type of store [NOISE] as well.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, that sounds like a good, uh, a good plan there.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But, uh, I'm not --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't know, it would -- it would cost quite a -- quite a bit there.
R:  Right.
L:  To do that.  I know that antiques are pretty expensive just for something small, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  That's the point in 'em.
R:  That's why we're not doing it, because we don't have the money to start, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  But if money --
L:  Well that's --
R:  -- was no option, hey! [LAUGH]
L:  Well exactly.  That's the thing though, you know.  This is America where everybody lives pay check to pay check I think. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yep, that's true.
L:  [SIGH] Hard to, uh --
R:  Well, when you get older you don't have to worry so much but I mem- -- I remember those days.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Remember them well.  But now our children are grown and gone and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- we have grandkids so it's -- it's a whole lot easier.
L:  Yeah.  I have two small, small children, so --
R:  Oh okay.
L:  -- you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh, besides that I'd also talked about, uh, opening a daycare center with my husband before.
R:  Oh okay.
L:  Being around the military there's a lot -- a whole lot of women who are willing to, you know, put their children in daycare, there's so many kids around this area.
R:  Oh sure, sure.  And then to find --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- somebody that's ...
L:  Reliable.
R:  Reliable and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- oh, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- y- y- you can leave your children with without worrying about 'em 'cause nowadays --
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  Now where --
L:  That wouldn't be too hard to start up something like that.  That's more of a realistic, uh --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- goal there.  But, um --
R:  But that's a challenge --
L:  Yeah.  This is --
R:  -- you know.  You've got to really like being around kids all the time --
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, 'cause, I don't know, it just seems like the kids nowadays are different than what they were.
L:  Well, I -- I -- I totally agree with that.  Totally agree with that.
R:  You know, they're -- I think their parents are working and feeling guilty and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, they -- they need to, I think, be like you, stay home.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Stay home, yeah.
L:  It -- it makes it nice and it's -- I know my little girl loves it so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it makes it a -- a lot easier for her.  But I'd like to give the children some kind of environment like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, home based environment where they can, you know, just have that adult around to talk to during the day or to play with or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- just anything like that.
R:  Right.
L:  Rather than just putting them in an actual daycare center that's fifty kids, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  They don't get enough attention that way I don't feel.
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  So --
R:  Yeah, that's --
L:  Yeah, that -- that -- that would be more of a realistic goal I think.
R:  Yeah, that would be a good job.
L:  Yeah, so --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  Um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] I don't know what else we can --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I could ask you about this. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  This is only the second time I've done this so --
R:  Oh okay.  Yeah.
L:  But, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'm not sure, um, I don't know.  What all -- what kind of, uh, maybe things would you -- would you try to look for specifically?  Any -- any items you would specifically try to sell or just ...?
R:  No, just j- --
L:  Miscellaneous.
R:  Just about ev- -- just about everything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Everyth- -- any, you know.  [MN] And not so much clothes or kids stuff, you know, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- uh, you know, knickknacks and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- things like that that, you know, people would be more likely to buy.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, rather than ...
L:  Right.
R:  -- clothing.  Clothing sometimes is hard.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  You know, it's hard to ...
L:  Would you have employees or would you do it just yourself?
R:  Well, I guess I'd have employees so I wouldn't have to work so much, then I could just --
L:  There you go.
R:  [LAUGH] What I want.
L:  Enjoy yourself a little.
R:  Right, do what I wanted to do. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  As long as they ran -- you know, as long as they were trustworthy, sure.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  And money is no option, this is -- this is kinda fun.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'd say, "Sure, you run the shop, I'll --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- I'll go to auctions or, you know, garage sales or whatever".
L:  Yeah, that would be the fun part.
R:  "I'll go get -- I'll go find stuff, you just sell it!" [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.  "You stay here and look pretty and sell what they --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- come up to the counter with.
R:  Right.  That's what I like, I like interacting with people and, you know, something that they wanna be there.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, not -- you know, not from where where you're trying to s- sell 'em something 'cause I'm not a really sales person but --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- you know, let them come and let them browse and let them buy and it's all up to them.
L:  Where's there's --
R:  You know.
L:  -- a willing participant there.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Yeah.  How would you advertise for that?
R:  Mm, local [NOISE] -- local paper.
L:  Mm.
R:  And like you said, probably the internet 'cause that's really the answer too.
L:  Right.
R:  [MN]
L:  I know I do everything through the internet so ...
R:  I know.  That's what I tell my husband, "We should think of something to sell".
L:  Mhm.
R:  And just put it out there.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And just do it from our home, you know.  But I don't know what to sell.
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Internet definitely ha- -- is a money making opportunity, that's for sure.
R:  Oh my gosh yes.
L:  So --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  You can pretty much do anything through the internet anymore.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Don't even have to leave home [LAUGH] if you don't want to.
L:  No, you don't trust me, I n- [LAUGH] -- I hardly leave. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Where are you located?
L:  We're in Texas.
R:  Oh okay.
L:  Yes, uh, being close to the base here a daycare center would be, um, a pretty reasonable realistic goal, it's -- I mean, there's every -- so many children around here.
R:  Okay.
L:  So -- but there again there's also a lot of housewives who do stay home with their children because their husband are -- is military.
R:  Right.  And if you move --
L:  So --
R:  -- round a lot it's hard for the wife to find, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- employment.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.  There isn't a daycare on the base?
L:  Oh, there is, there is.
R:  Oh okay.
L:  But like I said, it's just more of the fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty children --
R:  Oh okay.
L:  -- a day, you know.  I mean, I'm sure that they have the required number of adults to supervise but you still don't get the one on one attention that kids need I think.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah.  I don't know anything about military life so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it's interesting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  That's -- well, is this your -- how many times have you done this?
R:  This is, um, the second time.
L:  Oh okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay, it's the same.  All right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well --
R:  Well you're only allowed to do it three times, right?
L:  Right, I think so.  I think that's correct.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know if they ever offer it again or ...?
L:  I'm not sure.
R:  Yeah, I don't know, I'd have to talk to the lady or the man or whoever.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yep.
L:  But the -- it'd be nice to do something like this too.
R:  Sure.
L:  Do studies and stuff like that.
R:  Sure.
L:  That's pretty -- pretty interesting how they do this.
R:  Right.  So --
L:  So --
R:  Yep, that offers ya something.
L:  Right.
R:  Well, we're almost running out of time so I'm just trying to think if there's anything else I wanna say as far as opening the store or, you know, [NOISE] -- hopefully I could buy it.  You know, hopefully I could --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- rather than rent.
L:  Right.
R:  You know.
L:  Well, that way you'd have more money, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- rather than paying someone else.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right, I -- I'd buy it --
L:  Well, if there was --
R:  Money no -- money's no option so --
L:  Yeah, I was gonna say.
R:  -- I would buy it, I would buy it.
L:  If it was money no option, there you go.
R:  Yeah, I would buy it.
L:  Yeah.  That would be --
R:  And that way if it didn't work out [LAUGH] you know, we have something to sell! [LAUGH]
L:  There you go.  Sell and get some money back.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  There you go --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- that's right.
R:  That's true.  So [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Oh, that would work.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But ...
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Okay.  Well, um, I'm not sure what else to add to the conversation.
R:  No, I don't either 'cause it -- the [MN] -- pretty much a go if there's money's no option --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, you don't have any worries at all 'cause
