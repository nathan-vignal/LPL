L:  [NOISE] Hello?  What's up?  This is --
R:  [NOISE] Hi.
L:  [MN]
R:  Uh, where -- where are you?
L:  Uh, I'm in, uh, Staten Island, New York.  Where are you?
R:  Oh, I'm in Manhattan, New York.  I'd thought you'd be, like, far out somewhere else in the country.
L:  So, where are you? [NOISE]
R:  I'm in Manhattan.
L:  Virginia?
R:  Manhattan.
L:  Oh, Manhattan?  Oh, two in a row from Manhattan, all right.
R:  Yeah. [MN]
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, uh, they said we have to stay on the topic or they won't pay us.  So, [MN] would you leave --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for a million bucks?
L:  Uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- excuse me, uh, hold on a minute.  Let me turn this [PAUSE] sound down a little so [MN] distracting I can't hear. [MN] Okay, now what was that?
R:  [NOISE] Would you leave, um, the United States and never come back for a million dollars? [NOISE]
L:  [MN] Would I leave and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- n- never come back for a million? [MN]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] Uh, that's a -- that's kinda like a tough one. [MN] 
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  That's -- that's kinda a tough --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- there, uh, [NOISE] and -- oh, with no strings attached?
R:  [NOISE] I guess most --
L:  'Cause probably if there wasn't any strings attached, I probably would.  Because the most important thing would be, uh, my family so if I could bring them [MN] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, I would have no problem. [MN]
R:  Really?
L:  I would do it in a heartbeat.
R:  How about that?  I forgot to ask your name.  What's your name?
L:  Um, I'm sorry.  My name is Bruce. [MN] And --
R:  Bruce.  Hi, Bruce.  I'm Devorah. [MN] 
L:  Deborah? [MN] 
R:  Well, they said, um -- the questions were, "Where would we go?  What would we do?  What would we miss?  And what would we not miss?"  So, where would you go?
L:  [PAUSE] Mm, I don't know right off.  I don't have [MN] no idea where I would go with a million dollars [MN], u- [MN] then again --
R:  Would you like some place --
L:  -- then again --
R:  -- would you rather go some place, like, really warm or some place, sort of, very foreign?  And what would you like?
L:  I would probably sober up real quick --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I guess the first place I probably would go would be Mecca.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, so you're Muslim.
L:  Yes.
R:  How about that?  So, that would be interesting.
L:  I would probably go to Mecca.
R:  Huh. [MN] Well, I guess I'm not supposed to -- we're supposed to talk about the topic and not go off on a tangent about how you became a Muslim and all that stuff, so --
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  [NOISE] Uh --
L:  So, where would you go?
R:  [NOISE] Well, you know, the thing is I didn't really have a problem with it 'til they said never [NOISE] return.  And never return would hurt. [MN] I don't know if I could do never return.
L:  I mean, even if you were able to take your --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- your family?  Your relatives?
R:  Well, [MN] I don't know if they would come forever.  They might come to visit but forever?
L:  [MN] I think that million dollars would be very convincing. [MN]
R:  Yeah. [MN] I would -- I -- I -- well --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if -- if I were to go, before I woke up and said, "Wait a minute I can't stand this anymore" [LAUGH] [MN] I would go to France, I think, 'cause I'd like to speak French.  And I would -- I've also always been interested in going to Japan and to China. [MN] So --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- [MN] China would feel very foreign if I knew I couldn't go home again.  But Japan, I have some connections to Japan so that might feel comfortable. [NOISE]
L:  You speak any Japanese or Chinese? [MN]
R:  [MN] Um, I took one semester of Japanese and I can't say they ever really taught us to talk.  They most taught us to read wh- -- most of which I forgot, so ...
L:  Uh-huh. [MN]
R:  But I can talk, you know, a little teeny bit and I -- I'm, you know, if they t- -- [MN] I -- I -- I'm not that bad with the languages so I could, like, learn a little, you know?
L:  All right.
R:  [MN] Not that hard and I'm --
L:  Well, that's not bad, though.
R:  [MN] 
L:  I mean, you sound like, uh, to be a travelling person.  You like to travel?
R:  Well, I don't know.  I like foreign countries but I'm -- I -- I get dizzy when I travel. [LAUGH] I get [MN] -- not really good with that.  I have that, sort of, vertigo thing so ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [MN] But I, um, it says where we'll go, what should we do, wha- what would we miss and what not miss?  So, your main thing would be your family?  Like, if they were still here you would miss them and if they came with you you'd be okay.
L:  Well, I wouldn't say necessarily my family -- of course they would probably be one of the top priorities that I would miss.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But as far as, um, [MN] missing them and the whole nutshell [MN] I don't --
R:  Mix -- I can't hear you.  Mixing them, what?
L:  Missing them in the whole nutshell --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't think it would just consist of my missing them.  You know, I would probably miss the country itself, too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, the -- the, uh, the way the U.S. is --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- as opposed to a foreign country.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.  Mecca would be very foreign.  I'm here to tell you.
L:  Yeah, I know. [MN] 
R:  Very foreign.
L:  I definitely know I would have to do a major adjustment.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And [MN], yeah, like --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- like, it would be definitely, uh, [PAUSE] all -- all [MN] -- all [MN], like one hundred percent reverse of my lifestyle.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  And, [MN] it w- -- it would be difficult, I -- I know that but --
R:  But a -- but a h- --
L:  -- for a million dollars.
R:  -- but a million dollars would go far in --
L:  Yeah, that's what I mean.
R:  -- a place like that.
L:  For a million dollars I would --
R:  You could live forever in --
L:  I -- I -- 
R:  -- there.
L:  -- I -- I would be willing to put myself through that. [MN]
R:  Really?
L:  Um, you know?
R:  See, it's the never return part I have trouble with.  'Cause [MN] -- I wouldn't -- I could live somewhere else as long as I come b- -- could come back and visit, you know, [MN] sometimes.  And -- but never to come back and visit, I might even not do it. [NOISE] It might just -- 
L:  I don't know.
R:  -- bother me that much.
L:  Yeah, [NOISE] it is kinda -- I mean, the way they put it, it's almost like you're -- are exiling yourself --
R:  Right.
L:  Understand?  So --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- it could have a negative effect --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, mentally --
R:  What --
L:  -- yeah, I could --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- imagine --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that.
R:  [MN] I wonder if I'm allowed to ask you -- I can -- I guess it wouldn't be off the topic if I asked you about [MN] how you be- -- [MN] I mean, were you born a Muslim or did you become a Muslim?
L:  No, I wasn't -- well, technically, uh, we believe as Muslims that everyone is born a Muslim.
R:  Uh-huh.  But when did you ch- choose to?
L:  But I -- [MN] I was actually raised as a [NOISE] Christian. [MN] 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Uh, Protestant and, um, [MN] I was about twenty -- maybe twenty five [MN] when I became a Muslim. [MN]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I did it by way --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of, uh, being incarcerated.
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  And, um, [MN] it was the night, I think nineteen eighty nine [MN] --
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  -- and ever since then, you know, I've just been totally convinced --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, that I want to be a Muslim.
R:  That you want to be -- I have to make this phone louder -- wha- -- now I made it quieter.  It's hard to hear you, so ... [MN] Okay, [MN] sorry, I hear you a little better now.  Well, so that's interesting.  I have a good friend who's from Egypt and, uh, she's described sometimes the way people live just in Egypt and it's very, very, very different.  Very, very different.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah. [MN] I guess if you consider, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the, uh, sinner[?], which is like the traditions of the prophet [inaudible] and -- and what you've gotta realize too, you have seventy three different sects of Muslim. [MN]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, each one has, like, a different almost train of thought --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or school of thought.
R:  [MN]
L:  Or some -- most -- a lot of them have the same schools of thought --
R:  Well, I've gotta tell you briefly, I think we're gonna get off the topic and they're gonna get mad and not pay us.  So, we have to go back to this whole hypothetical idea of whether we're gonna --
L:  O- --
R:  -- I mean, I'm interested --
L:  -- -kay.
R:  -- in this.
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but we can't talk about it right now. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  True that.
R:  So, we're gonna go into, like, the -- the one --
L:  I will -- well, I'll tell you what --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I could -- I would do it.
R:  You would do it?
L:  No doubt about it.  I know I would do it and, um --
R:  [NOISE] I wonder if they'll do it for you then?  Maybe if you say yes on the phone they, uh, [LAUGH] they come up with the million bucks and they [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, right?
R:  -- uh, you never know.
L:  Exactly.
R:  [MN] Mm, I don't know. [MN] So, I don't know about France -- uh, France would be fun for a while.  I don't really see myself living there forever.  I think, you know, what would happen for me is, [MN] I would find another place to hunker in and make my home, you know?  Really.  I would -- I would find, uh, some place with, you know, greenery. [MN] I've sort of [MN] -- if I have to do a city it's gonna be New York, I don't [LAUGH] ... You know, I'd find some place --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that, you know, with a landscape I could relate to.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Not -- not too wild and not too tame and -- and, um, and I would, sort of, live quietly there, you know, and try and make that my home.  And find things that --
L:  [NOISE] Outside of the U.S.
R:  Outside of the U.S.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Outside of the U.S.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And I think if I really wanted to be a wuss about it, I'd, sort of, do Canada or, like, the Virgin Islands or someplace.  'Cause those both really feel like United States anyway, you know? [MN]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [NOISE] um, but if I was gonna do it for real --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I would go f- -- I would go over the ocean, I would go far and, uh, and I would -- I don't think I'd do it [LAUGH] in the end.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't think so.  Just because of the never return part would -- would [NOISE] make me nuts. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  That -- that -- that -- that -- I could see that as being very difficult.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I don't know, frankly, for me, I don't think I would really have a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a [MN] -- a big problem with that because most of my life -- I've been in New York, uh, twenty years --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, a little over twenty years this May -- May, twenty years.  And, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [MN] [NOISE] I actually didn't wait for my biological family that long. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.  You have seen them at all?
L:  I saw them for the first time in almost twenty years, uh, in December --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- last year.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And what was that like?
L:  Huh?
R:  What was that like?
L:  Oh, it was [MN] crushing.
R:  Aw.
L:  You know what I mean?  It was, you know, very, very, emotional and, uh [NOISE] --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- post-traumatic stress and everything came with it. [LAUGH]
R:  Aw, man.
L:  You know?  And, uh [MN] --
R:  People had gotten older?
L:  I mean --
