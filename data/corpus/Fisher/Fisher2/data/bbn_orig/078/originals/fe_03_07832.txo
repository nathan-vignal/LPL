L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello!
L:  [NOISE] How are you --
R:  Our subject of the day, you heard it, "Would you accept a million bucks to leave and where would you go?" [MN]
L:  [MN] Would I accept a million bucks to do what? [LAUGH]
R:  To -- to leave the United States, that's the, uh -- did you, did you hear her tell you what the theme of our conversation would be?
L:  Yeah, I thought she said minimum wage. [PAUSE] Hello?
R:  Uh, no, she said a million bucks.  Does that --
L:  Oh, she said --
R:  -- change [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, she said -- okay.
R:  I mean, that's what I thought.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Would you accept a million bucks to leave --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the United States and if so, where would you go?
L:  [MN] Yeah, uh, I would -- I would accept a million bucks to leave the United States and, uh, I probably would go, uh, mm, [MN] probably go over to France, London somewhere.  I want to go across seas.
R:  Because you speak French?
L:  [MN] [LAUGH] No, not -- not because I can speak French but I -- I like the French women.  I like, uh. [MN] I like --
R:  You like the French what?
L:  [MN]
R:  Women?
L:  I like the French woman.  French women --
R:  The French Women?
L:  Yeah, I -- I like their accents.  I just like the -- I think they're some of the most beautiful women in the world.
R:  Aha.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] Well [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I guess that's one reason. [MN] I think I would choose Canada because I am advanced in years and I wouldn't want to move into a culture that I wasn't familiar with.
L:  [MN]
R:  I don't know how old you are.  How old are you?
L:  I'm, uh, I'll be thirty five July eighth.
R:  Oh, that's -- thirty five tonight?
L:  No, no, [LAUGH] no, no.  I'll be thirty five on July eighth.
R:  On -- on July eight.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay, [LAUGH] well that's almost --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- tonight.
L:  Why would you accept Ca- -- why would you accept Canada?  Are -- are you familiar with the culture?
R:  [MN] Well, [MN] because it's very close to our own and because at my age [MN] I wouldn't want to plunge into a culture that was completely foreign, especially the language.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  There are too many needs as you grow older and, um, that's why I would choose Canada.
L:  [MN] 
R:  Besides, it's a great place. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, you've been there already?
R:  Yes, yes.  I've -- I've been there and I'm not really familiar with it but, uh, I think that anybody that -- Canadians who move back and forth across our borders all the time.  It's a very similar culture.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, that's why, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- when I would be offered a million dollars, uh, [MN] it would never compensate for having to go into a culture that was completely foreign to me.  You see, you're choosing even [MN] a western culture, right?  You aren't asking to go to Africa or to, uh, South America, et cetera.
L:  No.
R:  You're asking to go to a culture that's pretty close to our own.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- um --
L:  Is France -- France is not overseas?
R:  Is France what?
L:  I thought France was overseas, it's not overs- --
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  Yeah. [MN] That's, um [LAUGH] -- uh, that's why, uh, I -- I -- I mean, I -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm pretty, uh, I don't know, I mean, I'm intrigued by their -- their -- their culture and -- and -- and -- and -- and -- and their -- their accent and just the whole -- their -- their whole way of living over there.  I'm just intrigued by the whole thing.  You know?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That's why [MN] I would like to, uh --
R:  Well, do you think that you would be accepted --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and -- and taken in?  I mean, how would you feel about --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- moving into a culture where you didn't speak the language?
L:  Well, I'm -- I'm pretty -- I'm pretty sure that, uh, the million dollars would -- the million dollars would help me be accepted. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's right.
L:  Pretty much. [LAUGH]
R:  "Here comes the millionaire".
L:  That would be -- that would be an added incentive. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] "Here comes the millionaire, mademoiselle". [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] So, I -- I -- I -- you know, I -- it's just, like, I want to -- I want to marry a -- a-- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- a -- a-- a, uh, woman with an accent, like, such as --
R:  I don't blame you.
L:  -- French.
R:  At thirty five, and you're not married I -- I take it?
L:  No, I'm not married.
R:  Uh, at thirty five, I would too.
L:  Yeah.  I --
R:  Yeah, at -- at thirty five you can gamble.  You could go almost anywhere.
L:  Yeah? [MN] Well --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- well -- well --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you don't sound too -- y- you don't sound too, uh -- uh, a day over fifty, actually.
R:  I don't sound too what?
L:  Y- y- you don't sound like you're over fifty.
R:  Ho, ho, ho. [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]
R:  Seventy seven. [NOISE]
L:  Seventy seven?
R:  Seventy seven.  Yeah.
L:  Oh.  Consider --
R:  But --
L:  -- consider --
R:  -- but --
L:  -- that a compliment.
R:  [MN] Uh, really, I do. [MN] But I'm in -- I'm in real good shape and, you know, my outlook is good.
L:  You work out?
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  Oh.  Everyday?
R:  [MN] Uh, three, four times a week.
L:  Can you --
R:  I do Tai Chi.
L:  [NOISE] [MN] Oh, you do -- oh, Tai Chi.
R:  But other stuff, too.
L:  Oh.  What you do -- you do the -- the -- the slow moving postures or the standing --
R:  Well, [MN] I --
L:  -- the standing postures?
R:  I do -- there's two kinds, I do them both. [MN]
L:  You do them both?
R:  [MN] I do both kinds. [NOISE]
L:  Ah, okay. [MN] Well --
R:  [MN] But that's not what we're supposed to --
L:  Do -- do you think --
R:  -- talk about.
L:  -- I -- I know.  Do you think that, uh, a -- a million dollars would be sufficient enough for you to live the rest of your life, uh, on?  As --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- far as a nest egg?
R:  For -- for me, uh, it -- uh, certainly.  A million dollars --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- uh, would be enough. [MN] But you know something, at the age of thirty five, I don't know if a million is the way [MN] from what [MN] I gather --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- about you, [MN] uh, and, uh, that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it would be enough because, um, [LIPSMACK] inflation just keeps going up and up.  It costs more and more and more to live and I don't know.
L:  [MN] 
R:  I don't know.
L:  Exactly.
R:  [MN] But -- but I'll tell you, you would -- you would -- you would find a job wherever you went --
L:  Mhm.
R: -- so that you would always buffer that hu- -- that million bucks so that maybe you'd still have the million bucks --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- later on in life.
L:  That -- that -- that's true, that's very true.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's -- that's very true.  So -- so -- so [MN] --
R:  But I wouldn't want to give up a lot of the -- I wouldn't want to move to anything but a s- somewhat of a western democracy because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, th- that's the only place where living is -- is really halfway decent.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [MN]
L:  [MN]
R:  And you've chosen western democracies.
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  [MN] L- -- England and France.
L:  But I don't know -- I don't know how -- how the -- the -- the -- the -- the, uh, [MN] if the hi- -- the -- if the living is, like, really high over there, you know, the -- th- the -- the cost of living is high, I don't know, I'm not sure. [MN] I have no idea.
R:  It is, it is.  It definitely is and especially if you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, if you -- if you drive a car --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the gasoline is several dollars.  Three, four, five, whatever it is, a gallon.  It -- it's --
L:  What?
R:  -- unbelievable.  Oh, yes.  It isn't anything like here.  People just don't realize.
L:  It -- it's that high over there?
R:  Oh, for -- definitely. 
L:  Oh, well, I -- I -- I --
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  -- I -- I -- I would have to have another job.  I don't think a million dollars would -- would -- would -- would hold me over then at the age of thirty five. [MN] I don't believe that would really hold me over.  I would have to have [MN] an -- an -- a -- an -- a job to supplement my income or the income that I already have from the million dollars.
R:  Well, would you like to have a million bucks and then you wouldn't work?  Is -- is that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is that sort of --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- [MN] we- -- a -- oi -- that's the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- hypothetical or what?
L:  No, it -- it -- it -- it would -- it -- well, unless I -- unless I make some pretty good investments, uh --
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  [MN]
R:  [MN] Do -- do you -- do you work now?
L:  Yeah, I -- I'm -- I'm a laborer production.  Production laborer.
R:  In -- in what?
L:  I'm production laborer.
R:  What's a production laborer?
L:  Well -- well, [NOISE] what I do is I -- I -- I -- I package clothes, uh, once they come from, uh, being laundered, I package clothes and ship them --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- ship them off to different, uh, companies that we, uh, have contracts for as far as washing their uniforms and everything.
R:  Right.
L:  So, that's what I do.  I'm l- like a production laborer. [NOISE] That's what I do right now.
R:  Right.
L:  [MN] It pays eight fifty, [MN] it's pretty good.  It's -- it's -- it -- it pays the minimum wage.  You know, eight fifty an hour.  But that's not what we're supposed to talk about. [LAUGH] 
R:  No, that's right. [MN]
L:  [MN]
R:  Um, well, anyhow, I've -- I, um [MN] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think that Canada offers, um, [LIPSMACK] a great alternative, uh, without, uh, any, uh, culture shock.
L:  Mhm, culture shock such as, uh, was it [MN] -- you wouldn't have too much culture shock because you've already been to Canada.
R:  [MN] Well --
L:  As I say, for someone who -- who -- who -- who's not familiar --
R:  But it's --
L:  -- with the --
R:  -- different if you live there.  There's -- there's -- it's a very easy tr- -- it's an easy transition.  If you go to any other place --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if you're going to go to France, you will have a culture shock.
L:  Oh, definitely. [MN] But I think I would like the culture shock. [MN]
R:  Have you been to France?
L:  No, I've never been there.
R:  Okay.
L:  [NOISE] So, I think I would like the culture shock because of the -- uh, for one, the women.  I -- I -- I'm -- I'm such a big kinda philanderer, [MN] and I, [MN] like I said, I'm just crazy in love with their accent over there.
R:  Well, I think it's [LAUGH] beautiful too but [LAUGH] --
L:  Y- you know what I mean?
R:  -- but [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- if you go there and -- and you have an ear for it, not everybody speaks such  beautiful French. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah?
R:  Just like here.
L:  [MN]
R:  [MN] They don't speak -- everybody doesn't speak b- beautiful English. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm, mhm.  Yeah, that -- that's true.  That's very true.  They don't speak English fluently, neither.
R:  But this -- but this question of where you would go if you -- if you had a million bucks --
L:  I would go to the Bahamas, also.  That was my second pick.
R:  Where?
L:  To the Bahamas. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  That would be -- that would be my second pick because I --
R:  Well, then --
L:  -- I -- I think it's really beautiful. [MN] I -- I -- I --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I -- I, um --
R:  Yes.
L:  [MN]
R:  And -- and besides --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's -- it's the perennial vacation.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Life -- life is a vacation.
L:  Yeah, it -- it is per- perennial vacation.  That's -- that's like the ideal --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- vacation where everybody were [MN] --
R:  A laid back --
L:  -- the --
R:  -- place.
L:  -- hot spot -- hot spot, where everybody -- where everybody would go, you know?
R:  A laid back place.
L:  Yeah, very laid back place.  Very peaceful, very [MN] -- it's very scenic also.  Very scenic place, you know?  And I -- I -- I -- I think I -- [MN] I think I could live off a -- down in Bahamas off --
R:  There you g- --
L:  -- with a million dollars.
R:  I think you could too.
L:  I believe I could.  I -- I -- I believe -- I believe I could -- I could live at the age of thirty five --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- with a million dollars down there.
R:  I think they'd elect you king. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I think they would al- --
