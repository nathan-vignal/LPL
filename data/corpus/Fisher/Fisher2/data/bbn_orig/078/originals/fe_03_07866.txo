R:  Hi, my name is Fran.
L:  And my name is Joyce.
R:  Hi, Joyce.
L:  How are you?
R:  Okay, how about you?
L:  Good.  Kind of an odd topic.
R:  Yeah, isn't it.
L:  But boy, what thoughts it brings about.  I would love to go back and be a different parent.
R:  Oh, uh, really?  [MN]
L:  Oh, one hundred percent.
R:  Uh, you don't think you measured up?
L:  Uh, well, I did the best I knew how to do.
R:  Okay.
L:  And I think that I -- I've been a good parent.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I see where I maybe could've done things differently for a different outcome.
R:  Okay, okay.
L:  Um, I -- I would not have worked --
R:  Oh okay.
L:  -- for the first four years of his life.  I would've -- I would've made the sacrifice to stay home.
R:  Okay.  You think it would've made a significant difference?
L:  Well, I hope so.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- you know, maybe, maybe not, I don't know.
R:  Oh okay.
L:  He's -- I just -- there are things that I would like to do different.  I, you know, thinking about going back in time, that's -- that's the major thing that I would probably want to touch on is --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- maybe doing the parent thing --
R:  Oh okay.
L:  -- over again.
R:  Okay.  Wow.  Uh, you know, what?  I'm not a parent but my two sisters are and each of them sorta beats themselves up with, if only they would've, you know what I'm saying?
L:  Exactly.  The --
R:  I, but --
L:  Well that's what I'm doing.
R:  But I -- I think -- I think you guys are too hard on yourself! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I really do.  Because let's face it, you know 
L:  They're individuals and they turn out how they're gonna turn out.
R:  Yeah, it's su- -- I think certain personalities are developed --
L:  Well --
R:  -- in the womb.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  And that -- I think that's what I'm fighting against, is the personality thing, he's a very strong willed --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- independent personality and very out of the box in his thinking and the way he does things.
R:  Oh okay.
L:  And I'm so traditional and so in the box it's very difficult to change my ways --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- for him.
R:  Oh okay.  Well, uh, was it just you?  Were you a single parent?
L:  No.
R:  Oh.
L:  No.  Husband and wife.
R:  Oh okay.
L:  I guess we're both -- I don't know that my husband feels the same way, he thinks that we've done a god job.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I like your husband. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, you know how mothers are too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know what I'm saying?
L:  Yeah.  So what would you do different?
R:  Uh, some of the people I had in my life, I just wouldn't have 'em.  You know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, I -- I'd recognize the red flags that were given to me that they were users or just self centered or just not for my benefit.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  And I --
L:  I think that's a trap a lotta people fall into, that they --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- just don't see those things until it's -- your years have gone by.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  And I wasted a lotta time with a lot of negative energy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, for example, I will give a person the benefit of the doubt, I used to, you know.  And I'd say, "Oh, that's just how they are" but I had to realize that a lotta people have terrible motives.
L:  Including the family members.
R:  Oh they're the worst!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Or -- that's another thing that if I could -- if I could turn back the clock I would change things between my sister and I.
R:  Oh --
L:  For years and years and years I let her walk on me and abuse me.
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  And I'm -- I guess that [MN] -- not to pat myself on the back but I'm somewhat generous in nature --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and very forgiving.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And she took advantage and abused it.
R:  Oh okay.
L:  And -- and the day that I grew up and said, "No I'm not gonna take it anymore" --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and put my foot down --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- well, we haven't s- -- we haven't talked since.
R:  Oh okay.
L:  Because she doesn't like that she can't control me anymore.
R:  Oh.  Is she older or younger?
L:  She's four years older.
R:  Oh okay, okay.  When is her birthday?
L:  January.
R:  Oh, okay, okay.  Wow.  Well, does she have many friends?
L:  Um, not really.  None -- none that are -- that last more than two or three years.
R:  Okay, well --
L:  They -- they find out who she is and then they move on.
R:  I was gonna say, then you know it's not you. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I know that it's not me and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and my -- my own mother knows that it's not me.
R:  Oh okay.
L:  My -- my stepfather, who was able to separate a bit from the situation, knows that it wasn't me.  He says, "Joyce, you've done nothing but try and give her a helping hand --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- and all she's ever done was taken advantage".
R:  Mhm.
L:  He says, "You're not doing anything wrong".
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh okay, okay.
L:  So I know that it's not me but I would -- I would have -- I would've put my foot down probably many years earlier.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Not -- not to have the bad relationship but maybe had I done it earlier, not let her have her way with me for so long --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- maybe we wouldn't be where we are today.  Maybe she would've understood that, well, "I can't treat her this way".
R:  Mhm.
L:  Or, "I can't treat other people this way".
R:  Mhm.
L:  And maybe it would've been more of a learning thing for her.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think that possibly I put my foot down and it was too late.
R:  Oh okay.  But, by the same token, the right and wrong clock is in all of us, and people know when they're doing wrong, believe it or not.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know what I'm saying?
L:  Yeah.  I --
R:  [MN]
L:  I think so.
R:  Yeah, I -- n- no disrespect --
L:  There's always that little nagging thing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in the back of your head.
R:  Oh certainly, certainly.  Well, I'm sure she feels isolated now.
L:  Well, she does.
R:  Okay.  Okay.
L:  She does.
R:  Well -- well --
L:  But she doesn't accept responsibility?
R:  Oh no!
L:  Or she has no w- --
R:  She's not delusional?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, it's -- it's the full gammit, it's -- it's everything, you know, everyone -- it's always been -- she's always been on the pity parade, "Oh poor me, poor me".
R:  Oh my God.
L:  So, anyway, it's -- it's her own problem.
R:  Oh okay.
L:  It's her own doing.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um  and, you know, she's -- she can get herself out of it.
R:  Certainly sh- -- but you know, Joyce, it's hard to change.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know what I'm saying?
L:  It is.  It is.
R:  And it may be deeply embedded in her personality where she may not really want to see the light. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh I'm sure that she's very happy in knowing that she's perfect and everyone else is screwed up.
R:  Oh my God!  Wait a minute!
L:  I mean, don't you know people like that?
R:  Yeah, oh, plenty, plenty.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Okay, but, have you noticed, when something keeps happening to you from all different kinds of people from different walks of life, it's the same result, could it just be you? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, she -- see, that's just it, she's in such denial she doesn't see that -- that it -- it might be her.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  You know, it -- because [MN] it's not just her family that -- that she thinks are -- are, uh, heathens and, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- less than perfect because we don't attend her church --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's also in her church family that people have stepped back and stepped away.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So it's [MN], you know, and -- and that's something that she -- I wanna say that she has a lotta respect for, is her church family, but I don't know that she really does if she can treat them the same way she treats her family.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.  So, I don't know.
R:  Okay, now --
L:  I -- I just don't think that she has a grip on reality.
R:  Oh okay, it doesn't sound like it.
L:  No.
R:  Now -- now, where does this holier than thou or this superior attitude come from?
L:  Well, when -- when she found  Jesus.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that was late in life, that was in her --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- in her late thirties, early forties maybe.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And -- and she -- all of a sudden she was better than everyone else.
R:  Oh my God!  Wrong attitude for a Jes- --
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know, a Jesus --
L:  Very un Christian like.
R:  Yeah.  W- --
L:  But th- -- I mean, I don't [MN] -- I don't know wheth- whether it's her church that helped her believe that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Or -- or whether it's just her own interpretation.
R:  Mhm, mhm, mhm.
L:  So I don't know where it comes from but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, some of us just aren't willing to take that, we're just as good as she is.
R:  Okay.  But isn't it amazing that every walk of life has its snobs?  The -- the Christian snobs blow me away!
L:  Oh, don't they!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I consider myself a Christian but I'm not that way.
R:  Oh okay.  Okay.
L:  I'm not that way, I don't --
R:  I hear ya.
L:  -- you know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But there are snobs out there, you are absolutely right.
R:  Yes, yes.  Okay.
L:  We're a little off topic though, I wonder if they want us to get back to it? [LAUGH]
R:  Oh -- oh yeah --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- yeah, okay! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.  Uh, anything else you would change?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, I've always had a problem with weight and maybe if I was able to go back in time with the knowledge I have now I would -- I would do things differently so that I would not have an out of control weight problem.
R:  Oh okay, okay.
L:  Or what I feel is out of control.
R:  Okay, okay.
L:  And I -- although I -- I think that it's something that's just ingrained and -- and I would've had to have been raised differently in order for it not to be the way it is.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  You know, there are [MN], you know, family issues and, um, it's [MN], yeah, I don't know how much is in control if you go back and -- and do over.
R:  [MN] Yeah, yeah, I hear ya.  Um, I have a cousin and he says America is the only country where people die because of the food. [LAUGH]
L:  Well that's true, that's true.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And isn't it wonderful?
R:  Really, really.
L:  Isn't it wonderful?
R:  Yeah, I hear ya.  [LIPSMACK] Here's a -- here's another thing I would change.  I would be smarter with my money, in terms of better investments.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because you don't -- I'm starting to realize, you don't need a lotta money to get somewhere if you're really disciplined.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Well, we live in California and -- and I would do the same thing.  We live in California, um, we've owned three houses --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- in our married life --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and we were advised to keep the first one.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Keep it as a rental.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We paid thirty two thousand dollars for it.  Had we listened and taken that good, sound advice --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and we could've afforded to do that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that house would now be worth two hundred and thirty two thousand dollars.
R:  Oh my God, now that hurts.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Plus all the rent that we would have collected over the years.
R:  Certainly.
L:  And then the same thing with our second house when we sold that.
R:  [inaudible].
L:  "Oh, hang on to it if you can".
R:  Mhm.
L:  "Use it as a -- use it as a rental".  Our house payment was, you know, like, five hundred dollars and now it -- it could rent for fourteen hundred dollars.
R:  Wow, wow.
L:  So -- and then the -- we sold it for, you know, a hundred and sixty and -- and it's now worth like, two hundred and sixty.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  So there are things as far as investments go that, yes, just -- just purely
