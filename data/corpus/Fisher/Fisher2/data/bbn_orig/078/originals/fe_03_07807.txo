R:  Hi.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  My --
L:  Hi, who's this?
R:  Hi, my name's Patina[?].
L:  Hi, Regina.  This is Brett.  How are you?
R:  Good.  How are you doing?
L:  Good.  [MN]  Wha- what's the topic today?
R:  What?
L:  What's the topic?
R:  Uh, would you commit perjury for family or friends?
L:  [NOISE]  Wou- would you -- I'm in the car with a couple of friends of mine if you hearing some voice.  [NOISE]  Would -- uh, would -- would you?
R:  Um, I'm not [MN] exactly sure what perjury is.  
L:  Okay.  Perjury is [NOISE] yeah, perjury is, l- let's say you were on the witness stand, okay.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  You knew your friend of yours stole from the bank, right?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And you said on the witness stand, uh, no, he didn't steal.  You'd be committing perjury.
R:  Okay, so it's like lying on a witness stand?
L:  Yeah.  Perjury i- it's really more of a legal term in a courtroom.  If you know something as true and you lie about it you -- you -- it's almost like the old time movies, you know, when they swear you on -- when they swear you in and then you come up [MN] on the witness stand and you tell a lie.  That's perjury.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And -- and that is -- you can actually go to jail for that.
R:  Okay.  
L:  So, [MN] -- so I -- I guess they want to know if either one of us would commit perjury.  [LAUGH]  Wow.  I -- I don't know.  I don't -- I mean, uh, maybe [inaudible].  Maybe to save my friend's life maybe I would.  Or maybe to, uh, save their life maybe.  I -- short of that I -- I probably wouldn't.
R:  Mm.
L:  You -- you know [MN] -- you know what it means now?
R:  Yeah.  Well, I mean, I think it really does depend on the circumstances.  If it's like, you know, something like a parking ticket that I could help them get out of, you know, that I probably would think about, um -- I don't know, because if they're -- if you're going to commit perjury because they're about to go to jail, or about to be sentenced to death, it's probably something really serious.  Like they murdered --
L:  Hold on.
R:  -- somebody or ...  You know.
L:  What if it was your brother and -- and, uh, the girl -- the -- the girl said no and sh- -- and [MN] -- and he said yes, she said yes?  And he's up there for rape.  Would you now say?  What would you say then?  Would you lie for him?
R:  Ex- excuse me.  I can't hear you very well.
L:  I said, Virginia, what happens if -- if it was for rape and you -- you want to get your brother off of it?  And he told you he did rape her.  And he said -- and he said no on the witness stand.  Would you lie for him?
R:  No.  I don't think so.  Because it's a pretty serious thing.  
L:  [MN]
R:  You know.  Like, if it's --
L:  So, [several inaudible words].  [inaudible] you plan on locking your brother up for some sexual intercourse.  That's what you're saying.  You're saying he did.  Knows the girl and that, you know, she said no.  They were naked and, uh, you know, it just happened.  And -- and n- now she's said to the [MN] cops he raped me.  And, uh, you ask your brother.  You ask your brother, " [MN] did you do it?"  [several inaudible words] we were naked honey and, uh -- and, uh ...
R:  Well then it's no longer a perjury then because you don't know.  You're asking your brother and this girl.
L:  Well, he admitted to you that she -- that she said no.  That -- that she did say no.  
R:  Wait.  [MN]  So who said what?
L:  Your -- your [MN] -- your brother has said, yes he did do it when she said no but they were both naked in bed.  She did say no.  And no means no, but he did it anyway and he tells you he did it.  But can you please lie for him on the stand otherwise he goes away for twenty years.  Now what are you gonna do?
R:  Well, like I said, it's a pretty serious crime so I'm not gonna lie.  You know.  
L:  So you'd see your brother go away for twenty years. 
R:  Yeah, I think --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I would.
L:  What?
R:  I think I would.  
L:  I don't think he'd want to see you go away for twenty years.  He'd lie for you, I'm sure.  [NOISE]
R:  I don't know.  I mean, so you would -- you would lie for your brother about that?
L:  Absolutely, I would.  Absolutely.  [MN]  Absolutely.  Bank robbery, I'd lie for him.  I'd lie for him, yeah, absolutely.  Yeah.
R:  Mm.
L:  As long as no one's getting killed.  If he shot and killed somebody, different story, and I knew he did it, you know.  Then I could say, you know ... But, you know.  Hold on one second.  [NOISE]  Regina?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, yeah, that was a buddy of mine.  We're just getting your[?] opinion.  Uh, we're all driving in the car together.
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  Yeah, so, uh, you know I used to be a lawyer so that's why I -- I -- I know a little bit about it.  [NOISE]  Yeah, we both were attorneys.  
R:  Okay.  
L:  Yeah.  So perjury it's -- if you watch like The Practice or any of these TV shows, you know, if they say something, you know, they'll say, you -- do you realise, uh, that you're committing perjury and you could be, uh, in prison for a certain amount of time?  
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah.  I --I -- but [MN] [NOISE]  Yeah.  Yeah, Kenny wants to know if you'd lie for your dad?
R:  No.  It's -- it's not dependent on who it is.  
L:  Yeah.  Not even, uh, not even ...  [NOISE]  She -- no you said, you would [several inaudible words] so you would -- [MN] -- so, yeah, you would never commit perjury?
R:  No.  No.  If it's like something that I feel like, you know, like I gave an example of a parking ticket, I'll [inaudible] --
L:  Right.
R:  You know, something that's not really harmful to anybody in particular.  
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah. [NOISE]  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, you know, the problem with the law is it doesn't really distinguish between lying for a parking ticket and lying for a murder.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's still considered perjury.  [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  So it [MN] -- [NOISE]  Yeah, so it's -- there's really no such thing perjury light or, uh, perjury medium or perjury ...  You know, it's -- it's, uh, like -- it is what it is.  
R:  Mm.  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  
R:  Okay.  So, I mean, so your friend there, he would -- he would basically lie for a serious crime.  Basically that's what he's saying.  What about you?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [NOISE]  No, he's a liar in general quite frankly, but, uh, we -- this is really no different from anything else.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]  No, but -- no, perjury is actually very serious.  [NOISE]  He said he would lie for family and, you know, you know, [MN] you know, one never really knows until they sit in that -- put in that situation, you know what I mean?  You have a family member who may be sent away for life or maybe, I mean, you know.  [MN]  You know.  So ...  This is my third survey.  Uh, well -- how -- how many have you done, Regina?
R:  What?  I can't hear you very well.
L:  How many surveys have you done?  This will be my third.
R:  Uh, this is just my second one.  
L:  Yeah, okay.  [NOISE]  Yeah, how old are ya?
R:  Does it matter?
L:  No.  Just curious.  Just curious.  
R:  I don't --
L:  You -- you -- you sound -- you sound like you're a college girl.  
R:  Okay.  What makes you say that?  
L:  I don't know.  You sound like your like [several inaudible words] [NOISE]  Oh, stop it, Ken.  No, he's not -- I -- I guess [MN] I -- I wanted to know who I'm talking to in terms of age because I'm in my forties and you sound like someone that might be in their twenties.
R:  Yeah, I -- I'm in -- I'm in my twenties.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  You know.
L:  But you didn't know what perjury was so I was just curious.  
R:  Of the [MN] I don't know the legal term?  Is that right?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Obviously you're not in law school.  I mean, but you know, are you a college girl?
R:  [LAUGH]  What?  Why are you so fixated on that?
L:  I don't know.  Because, you know what I mean, sometimes it's nice to know who you're talking to on these things and sometimes the level of the education, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just -- you -- you got to eat up ten minutes somehow, right?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.  Well, so you're a lawyer?  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  What kind of lawyer?
L:  I was a prosecuting attorney for a couple of years.  
R:  Did you specialize in anything?
L:  Well, as a prosecutor you don't really specialize in anything.  You work for the state and you, like, putting it bluntly you kind of put away the bad guy.  
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  But [several inaudible words].
R:  But, I mean, well there's like -- so you were a D.A. or no?
L:  D.A. is another word for an assistant D.A., prosecutor.  Same thing.  
R:  Mm.  Okay, because I mean, I know prosecuting attorneys who are, you know, not working for the government.  
L:  Well, I don't know.  I don't know how you can be a prosecuting attorney without being working for the government.  Uh, pr- prosecuted by the essence of what it is, is that a prosecutor for the state.  You -- you can't prosecute privately.  If you prosecute privately then you're a litigator.  You're not a prosecutor.  
R:  Okay.  Okay.  So, okay.  Maybe I just know litigators then.  
L:  [NOISE]  Well, you must be from L.A. because, you know, [inaudible] it's one of those L.A. calls.
R:  No, I'm not --
L:  So, uh --
R:  -- actually.
L:  [NOISE]  Okay.
R:  No, I'm not.  Um, so have you ever convinced any of your clients to do perjury?
L:  No, of course not.  If I -- if I know somebody who was -- who was committing perjury I couldn't put them on the stand or I'd advise them, uh, not to [inaudible] the perjury.  No, if I knew someone was committing perjury then I would be guilty of committing perjury also.  
R:  Mhm.  
L:  It's not just the person that does it.  It -- it -- it kind of transfers to the attorney who knows about it.  And you can be disbarred --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the attorney can be put in jail also if he knows his client is committing perjury.  Or he suggests that his client commit perjury.
R:  Hm.  Oh, okay.
L:  So [MN] -- pretty serious thing.  You know, I feel +people take it lightly but it's, uh, it can [MN] get a guy disbarred.  He can get a, you know, it could just really, really, really, become really bad.
R:  Yeah.  Okay.  So, I don't know.  I [MN] -- I guess I didn't really realise how serious it was.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, 'cause you're --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, um, you --
R:  -- making it sound much more serious than the first person did.  
L:  Yeah, you seen these TV shows where they had the guy swear on the bible and all that stuff.  They swear 'em in.  
R:  [MN]  Yeah.  
L:  That's to make sure the person doesn't commit perjury.  That's basically saying in fancy lang- -- legal language, I will not commit perjury.
R:  Mhm.  Mm.  Okay.
L:  I wonder how they come up with this subject, huh?
R:  I don't know.  I don't know.  What was the other --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- topic you talked about?
L:  [MN]  One subject.  I don't know why, one of the surveys was on, uh, the heck was it?  Somebody asked me if I could have my own holiday what holiday would I -- would I want?
R:  Yeah, I had that one.
