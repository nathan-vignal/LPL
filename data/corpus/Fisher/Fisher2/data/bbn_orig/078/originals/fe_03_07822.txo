L:  Hi, this is Linda.
R:  Hi.  Nick.
L:  Hi, Nick.
R:  So, what's up?
L:  Okay.  I guess we're gonna talk about, uh, if -- if we had a million dollars if we would --
R:  If you would accept a million dollars to leave the U.S.?
L:  Yes.  I would.
R:  Yeah, same here.
L:  [LAUGH]  Would ya?  [LAUGH]  Um, where would you go?
R:  Uh, one of two places.  Either Australia or, um, England.
L:  Mhm.  I think I would do some research and f- figure out a place where, uh, the lowest cost of living is.  I could make my money go [MN] --
R:  Pretty much Australia.
L:  -- further.  Is that Australia?
R:  Yeah.  'Cause they --
L:  Yeah?
R:  'Cause it's -- y- you don't have to learn a new language.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, their -- their technology is right up there with us. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, it's -- it's not all kangaroos and --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- lizards.  You know.
L:  [LAUGH]  And the outback, huh?
R:  You got [MN] like Sydney.  Sydney is a beautiful city.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I +remember 'em from the Olympics.  Um, [LIPSMACK] let's see.  What I would miss most about the United States?  Uh, I don't think I would miss anything.  I'm [MN] very --
R:  Yeah.  The only --
L:  -- um ...
R:  -- thing I would miss about the United States really is the job opportunities.
L:  [MN]
R:  Because just about anybody can get a job if they really wanted to.  
L:  If they really want to.  Yeah.  And you don't think you can in Australia?
R:  Oh, I can because I --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I'm going into computers.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, you know, uh, the U.S. is so deep into computers that we're more advanced in computers --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- than anybody else.
L:  Okay.
R:  So -- ex- except Japan.
L:  But, see, with a million dollars you wouldn't have to work.  
R:  That's true.
L:  So you could just have a hobby.
R:  But then --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  But then the other thing is the, uh, American dollar isn't worth the same in other countries.
L:  Mhm.  That's why --
R:  So if I would get a million dollars in the country I'm moving to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I -- I would choose --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- Australia.
L:  Oh, I see.  I see.  Yes, I, um, I'm retired so, um, always looking for, uh, places where, uh, the c- -- either the cost of living is low or there's no state taxes like in Florida.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Which is, uh, really, um -- I like to read those articles where it says the best --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the best places to retire and stuff.  But, um, the thing that I wouldn't miss is the politics, I guess.  And -- and the television coverage of [LAUGH] politics.
R:  I -- I can see where you're come from but, I don't know, I like -- I like the, uh, democratic system because it's -- you can pick who you -- who you're going for.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I -- I just think, uh, it's gotten to be -- [MN] I -- I can't believe we both want to leave the United States [LAUGH] +because ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I -- I -- uh, when -- I have become more of a history buff in my, uh, older years and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, I can't -- I can't believe how +the, um, poli- politicians are just -- there's just no -- no honor to be, um, a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- President or a politician anymore.  So I wouldn't miss [LAUGH] -- miss that.  Especially with the upcoming election and all the -- the, um, ads and the smearing of, uh, well, ad campaign smears, I won't miss.  I wouldn't miss that at all.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- I'm not sure.  I have never been a- abroad but I'm -- probably might miss the food.  My American food.
R:  The food.  Uh, uh, I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, you grow up with this food and it's, you know, you get used to it.
L:  You [MN] -- you acquire, uh, uh, what is.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, like our pizza.
R:  I -- I think it -- I think it would be nice to acquire, like, a new taste.  
L:  Yeah.  Well, I know that our pizza is nothing like what a pizza is in Italy.  If they have [LAUGH] it at all.
R:  No, they have that thick stuff.
L:  [LAUGH]  [MN]
R:  We Americanized it.
L:  So it would -- would be -- I guess I would like to try new things but I don't know if I would ...
R:  I mean there's -- there's always ways to -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to -- to get the same food.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Everywhere in the world you can get the same food.
L:  You could recreate --
R:  It just --
L:  -- it.  And -- and what do you think about we couldn't come back?  You just have your friends come there?
R:  I'd make new friends.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Make new friends.
R:  I could deal with that.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  A million dollars.  I could -- I could just buy 'em.
L:  Have 'em o- come over. 
R:  That's true.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Family.  [MN]  Would you be, uh -- um, you said Australia.  Is it because you've been there before?
R:  No, I just --
L:  Oh.
R:  You know.  I -- I just like the way it sounds.  I mean --
L:  Oh.  Oh.
R:  -- the people there are all, you know, spontaneous.  It's just -- it just seems like a happy place.  It's -- you -- you never heard of Australia being in any wars or nothing.
L:  That's true.  That's true.  That's, uh, you came up with that pretty quickly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Um, a million dollars.  A million dollars.  I, uh, I'm always -- I've always, uh, reminded of the -- the movie where Demi Moore was offered [LAUGH] a million dollars --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to -- to go with Robert Redford for a night.  Um --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I'm not sure what kind of, uh, promotion this would be to get someone to -- to leave U.- -- the, uh, U.- U.S.  
R:  I don't know.  
L:  Um.  Well, think of something else you'd miss.
R:  [MN]  I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  Um.  The education.  
L:  Yeah.  Opportunities for education.
R:  Right.  
L:  I would +definitely have -- I -- I like four -- the four seasons so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think would, oh, [MN] seek a place that had, um, some semblance of four seasons.  
R:  No, I'd -- I -- I'd have to take the three.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh, being student, you know, you kind a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Kind of get out of some break.
L:  Yes.  Yes.  Still live on school calendar.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yes.  Well, I can't think of anything else I would miss or -- or wouldn't miss.  
R:  I don't know.  What was the -- what -- what other topics were supposed to be there?
L:  Uh, it just said a million dollars [SIGH] to leave and never come back.  Um, what would you miss and what you wouldn't miss.  
R:  I don't know.  [MN]
L:  I guess you'd have to do a lot of, uh, research about the country you were going to, too.  So if you had that much time.
R:  Mm.
L:  I always though Monte Carlo would be cool but I'm sure that's more of a romanticizing it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN]  Yeah, I guess.  I don't know.  
L:  [LAUGH]  I don't know.  Sometimes I think I could chuck it all but that would be only if I had to make that decision, like, quickly.  I think if I was given, you know, time to think about it I'd probably talk myself out of it because of my fam- family and kids and -- and all the, uh, friends I have at -- at church and, well, everything that I belong to.  But --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think sometimes it sounds very, uh, oh, very alluring to just be able to take off and never come back.  
R:  I don't know.  I can't think of anything else.
L:  I know.  I can't --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- either.  I think we should [LAUGH] -- I know [several inaudible words] said they were gonna tell us when ten is up.
R:  Yeah, and you can't --
L:  Um --
R:  -- hang up until then.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know what else I would miss?
L:  What would you miss?
R:  Things like this.
L:  Okay.  
R:  I -- I don't think any other country --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- pays people to -- to talk on the phone.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  There is that.  Uh-huh.  Well, you know with the current, uh, well I guess with the Iraq and all the -- the Somalian [inaudible] -- [MN] I just feel like it's only in recent years that we've learned [MN] how much we have to value our freedom because when --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, when I was little or even, I guess, [MN] studying history, um, I didn't have any idea that -- that peop- -- that women were so, you know, oppressed.  And people were [LAUGH] so oppressed in other lands.  And, uh, boy, it's just been in the last ten years that we've seen how very lucky we are with our --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- our freedom of -- of speech, religion and ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  Probably take it for granted because we're spoiled enough.  Always grown up -- we've grown up [MN] with it this way.  
R:  I -- I could see where you're coming from 'cause other countries, you know, we -- we -- everything we need we've got.
L:  Mhm.  We don't even know wh- what it's like to not be able to go to the church that we, um, of our --
R:  Are forced to go to?
L:  -- choosen- -- choosing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, sometimes I trying to put myself in the -- those people's shoes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I would miss that freedom.  
R:  Yeah.  It's not easy.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  It wouldn't be easy.  
L:  But I think for a million dollars I could be a vagabond and --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and really not settle down a- anywhere.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  See the, um, see all the little -- I mean, to -- to -- to travel and not have any, um, time constraints, like itinerary.  Have to be here.  Have to be there.  Have to, uh, uh, see this and this and this.  You know.  See things that aren't in the tour book and ...  Um ...
R:  But you know what I think?  Like going back to what you were saying about choosing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think if -- if the people from other countries had, um, come over to America and could choose and could -- had the ability to choose what they wanted right now --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they would be lost.  
L:  Mm.
R:  Because they're so used to people telling them, okay, do this now.  And do it this way.  And here, you know, you just, okay, you want to be a bum on the street, go ahead and you wanna --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- go make yourself something.
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  Jobs to be if you want.  And ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I wouldn't tell anyone if I
