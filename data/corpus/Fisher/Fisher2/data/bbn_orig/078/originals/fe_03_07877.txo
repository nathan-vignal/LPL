L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  [LAUGH] Hi. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, hi, My name's Jason.
L:  I'm Sasha. [NOISE]
R:  You're what? [NOISE]
L:  Sasha.
R:  Oh, hi, Sasha.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, o- --
L:  So -- [LAUGH]
L:  Wh- what was the topic again, if we could go back in time and meet somebody?
L:  No, if you could go back in time and change something.
R:  Change something.
L:  Mm.
R:  I guess I should ask you, like, where you're from and stuff?
L:  Uh, we have to talk about the topic frame[?] and --
R:  Okay. [NOISE]
L:  Right, uh --
R:  So -- [NOISE]
L:  What?
R:  So, if we could go back in time and change something, what would we change?
L:  Right.  You go --
R:  I mean, I -- I guess there were --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- plenty of bad things in the past, right?
L:  Uh, yes.  I like that song, "If you could turn back time". [LAUGH] If I could turn --
R:  I -- I -- I know -- I know -- I know what song you're talking about, I just don't ever sing it.
L:  Think it's Cher.
R:  If I could turn -- okay, I'm not --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- going to sing on the -- on the recording, um [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  What would I change?  I mean, I don't know how far back in time they're thinking, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, obviously, uh, I don- -- I think the holocaust would be one thing that would, uh, be a good thing to avoid.
L:  Oh, I thought they meant more like things I could change rather than things that you wish you could change.
R:  Oh, you mean, like, in your lifetime?
L:  That's what I thought they meant.
R:  That's a good point.  What would I change -- or wha- -- why don't you tell -- what do you, uh -- what -- what would you do, do you have any idea or ...?
L:  Um, well you know, I like to live my life so that I don't want to change anything, so, um --
R:  That's a good policy.
L:  No, I wouldn't change anything because even if things that I -- I'm not so thrilled about, you know, they all serve a purpose.
R:  I suppose that's true but don't you think that there might be something that you've done that you might regret or it's just your policy, no regrets?
L:  No, no, I mean, I don't regret it but I'm not going to dwell on it.
R:  Well, even if you don't dwell on it would you ever consider going back and changing something if you could?
L:  Well, yeah, maybe.  But, I wouldn't because it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- helped everything turn out the way that it has, ergo --
R:  Oh, so you think everything -- you think everything's going together really?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't think you can change just one thing  -- haven't -- uh, what's that stupid movie?
R:  There was the Simps- -- yeah, well there was a Simpsons about that actually, where Homer had --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a -- do you ever watch Simpsons -- I don't know, I'm a big Simpsons fan.
L:  Yeah, I watched it today. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, good, [LAUGH] yeah, Homer had this magic toaster -- I don't know if you've seen it -- and so -- yeah, I mean, it's not magic obviously -- he doesn't know it's magic and when he starts using it and he ends up traveling back in time, and he's, like, "Okay, what have I, uh, done, we never stepped on anything", and, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then he ends up stepping on this mosquito and he goes back to real life and then his whole family have tongues like snake tongues --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and then, you know, he goes back in time and tries to fix it and then he comes back and -- and, you now, every -- and they're all really small and they're in a doll house and Maggie is really huge and she's looking through the window with her big eye -- and it's real funny. [NOISE]
L:  Mm. [NOISE]
R:  What would I change -- I mean, I don't say -- I've done a couple of, like, stupid things, you know what I mean --
L:  Uh --
R:  Not stupid, like, bad decisions or stupid, like, dumb things that you wish you could change.  Like, I was riding my bike once and I saw my neighbor and I was, like, looking at him and, like, waving and, like, "Oh, hi, you know, Mr Mann", that was what his last name, Mr Mann" and I was riding right --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- into my neighbor's mailbox.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] And so, you know, they all kind of had a big laugh about that, I still remember that obviously 'cause it was so embarrassing. [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know if I shouldn't be more noble than just wanting to change embarrassing things and I hope that [NOISE] --
L:  Well, I don't think that they meant you could change the holocaust.
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  Okay.
R:  What else would I change?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  If I could go back in time --
L:  What?
R:  I'm sorry, I'm thinking of going back to, like -- I mean, I -- I used to do a lot of, like, little competitions when I was a kid, like spelling bees and, like, all that kind of stuff --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean, like, you do wonder what happened if you got that word right, you know.
L:  [LAUGH] I guess, [LAUGH] I don't think I would change any of that unless the prize involved.
R:  Well, they was -- like, I -- I made it to, like, my county spelling bee, right, and so I'm in the little -- I think I was in sixth grade -- so I get into the little kids group and, uh, I'm at -- I think I was -- uh, there were, like, five of us left, and I think I was kind of dreading it and I've a grandpa named Stuart --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- and so he spelled his name S.T.U.A.R.T. --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and so -- and so they give me the --
L:  How?
R:  -- word --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I'm sorry?
L:  How do you spell it?
R:  [LAUGH] S.T.U.A.R.T. I'm right, anyway [LAUGH] --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- anyway, uh, they, uh -- they gave me the word stewardess and I'd never seen it in -- in print before so I -- I was, like, "Okay, Stuart S", so I -- so I spelled my grandpa's name and I spelled, you know, S. at the end and they thought it was wrong and I wa- -- you never know what would have happened.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You have anything like that?
L:  Uh, yeah, I spelt cathedral wrong and some fish or something, I don't remember what it was --
R:  Fish is not too hard.
L:  No, some kind of fish.
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] kind of fish.
L:  Maybe it wasn't some kind -- I don't remember -- that was I didn't want to know anything about it afterwards, like, how to spell it or anything -- I didn't get care.
R:  I -- I also spelt malediction wrong -- I don't know if you know what that is?
L:  Uh, it's a --
R:  I'm pretty sure it's like --
L:  -- bad thing.
R:  Yeah, something -- a bad thing -- so I spelt mal addiction, you know --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- but instead of, like, the way it's really spelt.  But, you know, a spelling bee is, you know -- who really cares?
L:  Yeah, it wouldn't really change --
R:  I mean, you have to lose at some point unless you're one of those crazy kids like you see on ESPN so [LAUGH] --
L:  Mm.
R:  Although that is probably the only way I would get on ESPN.
L:  Yeah, be silly. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.
R:  Uh, did you ever have any, like, major injuries you would want to ...?
L:  Um, I mean, I guess I'd rather not have had scoliosis but there's not, like, anything you can do about that.
R:  You have scoliosis?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's not, like, I jumped off a bridge and then, uh, "Shoot, I wish I didn't do that".
R:  [COUGH] My cousin has scoliosis, she had to stick with the brace for a couple of years.
L:  Yeah, me too, well one year anyway.
R:  Ouch.
L:  Yeah.  It wasn't that fun.
R:  Yeah.  I did break my finger once.
L:  Oh.
R:  But I did enjoy that because it really didn't hurt too much --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but, all I mean -- I didn't enjoy it enjoy it but, you know, I broke my finger and --
L:  When I broke my [NOISE] did you enjoy it?
R:  Well. yeah, but, you know, it didn't really hurt too much and then when I had to be getting it fixed that I had to be in this cast for two weeks.  I'm a lefty and I broke my left pinkie so, you know, oops, I can't write or type or anything so I had, like, two weeks of school where I just had to, like, sit there --
L:  Yeah, that sucks.
R:  So, that was kind of fun.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You think it sucks, [LAUGH] I enjoyed it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you enjoy school or ...?
L:  Do I enjoy school?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Well, you said --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it sucked -- you said it sucked to have, uh, your finger broken for two weeks when you -- and you ma- -- so you can't take notes or anything.
L:  Yeah, well then you got to trust other idiots.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, there's always a couple of smart people in every class.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, I don't trust them either.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Are you one of those smart types?
L:  Oh, yeah, that's me. [LAUGH]
R:  I see.
L:  [PAUSE] So, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Changing something about the past, what would I do.  I remember one time, uh -- I -- I have twin cousins and they were over at my house and so my mom was going to videotape my aunt giving them their first haircut --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and -- and I was, like, "Oh, let me use -- let me use the video camera, please let me use the video camera", so they let me and I -- I just knew -- I discovered this thing had a zoom in and zoom out and so I was just having so much fun with that -- and I still don't know to this day whether or not I missed the first haircut just because I was being such an idiot with the zoom in and zoom out --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and, like, afterward I felt really, really bad, I never told anybody or anything --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- 'cause, you know, if they s- -- if they watched the video and they saw it then great and if they watched the video and didn't see it then they would have probably said something.  So, hopefully I've got off clean on that one but --
L:  Yeah, and did you mention[?] that? [LAUGH]
R:  Huh?
L:  Actually[?] [several inaudible words] , so ...
R:  Oh, yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] [NOISE] [SIGH]
R:  What if you could go back and change something about yourself?
L:  What if I could do what?
R:  Like not -- something about yourself, like, not, uh, an event but just something.
L:  Uh, no, I don't think so.
R:  You wouldn't change anything?
L:  Maybe I would have not had all that total[?] cereal I had earlier today, but, uh --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I [NOISE] don't think [NOISE] I'll come out any worse for it. [LAUGH]
R:  Huh, it's probably a minor thing.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  I guess I would -- I think I would try to make myself read more, I don't read very much.
L:  Mm. [NOISE] No, I think I read eno- -- maybe I would make myself care more. [NOISE]
R:  Care more? [LAUGH]
L:  But, then, you know, it can't be too hard for me to be friendly[?] [inaudible]. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, you sound a bit empathetic? [LAUGH]
L:  Mm. [NOISE] I've a headache -- [NOISE]
R:  Uh, I'm sorry.
L:  -- and my eyes hurt because I wanted to take my contacts out before this call, but then I didn't get a chance. [NOISE]
R:  Oh.
L:  That's what I would change if I could go back.
R:  That's what -- [LAUGH] that's what you  would change --
L:  I would have taken out my contacts and gotten my blueberry.
R:  Blueberries?
L:  Yeah, like, blueberries. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah, they're good for you.
R:  Yeah, maybe if I could go back in time I would make myself not like ice cream --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- 'cause I've eaten so much of that over the years, [LAUGH] I would probably be like a super model if I hadn't eaten any of those.
L:  Yeah, okay. [LAUGH]
R:  All right, well maybe that's an exaggeration.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] I like soft ice cream not hard. [NOISE] I lis- --
R:  Oh, ice cream is ice cream to me. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh. No, I much prefer soft, 'cause it's more like a milk shake and I'm a big --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean, I guess if you could go back in time then you can, like, find lottery numbers or something but, you know [PAUSE] that might not be, uh, something that --
