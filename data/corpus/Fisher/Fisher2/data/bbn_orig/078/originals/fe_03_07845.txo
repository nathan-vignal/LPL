R:  [NOISE] Hi.  My name is Billie. [NOISE] 
L:  Hello.  I'm Lyle.
R:  How are you?
L:  I'm okay. [MN] 
R:  Well, good.  Well, I guess, [MN] if I were given a million dollars I probably would leave the United States. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] You would leave, huh? [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, I think I would.  I think I would probably go to Australia.  What would you do?
L:  I don't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- think I would leave for a million dollars.
R:  You don't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- think so?
L:  No.
R:  And why is that? [NOISE]
L:  Well, I guess I value the, uh, protection that we used to --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- ha-.  And the freedom and the court system and -- it --it would have to be some place extraordinary, I guess like Australia --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I guess, that would -- I could be persuaded but I cou- -- I couldn't do it.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  [MN]
R:  I think it would be hard.  I -- I think that's probably why I picked Australia, because of, you know, it -- it's, um, similarities with, uh, you know, with the English [MN] -- with the English language.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I know the culture's probably different and the seasons are different and, um --
L:  Well, it's probably the closest thing outside the U.S. that you can come to.
R:  [MN] Yeah, probably so. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, you know, I [MN] -- I -- I think it probably may have to do with my age.  I'm -- I'm almost fifty two and I think, well, with that million dollars I could [MN] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, start -- start over and invest the money and, uh ... [NOISE] Of course never coming back, never seeing my family and friends, it would certainly [MN] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that -- that would be difficult. [LAUGH]
L:  Sure. [NOISE] Well, that's the -- it's probably the biggest thing, is the family, you know?  The --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the governments and the cultures you can get used to but missing their family, I -- you'd almost feel like a, uh, I guess an escaped convict or something [inaudible].
R:  Yeah, [MN] I -- I think probably even close to being an alien, you know?  We are --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- alienated from [MN] all that was familiar to you. [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Now I've -- I've -- I've moved [MN] within the United States, away from my family but I guess [MN] I always knew I could go and visit them.  And, you know, if you give up your country and you c- -- you can never go back, you know, that -- I think that probably would be hard. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I don't want to give up my rights of being a U.S. citizen either.
R:  [MN] Yeah.  My -- I think that [NOISE] it's a lot to think about.
L:  True.  The thing is --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- with the age of the Internet though, you can email and you can call and [MN] --
R:  Well, that's true.  And y- you can [MN] --
L:  -- twenty years ago it's pretty slow communication to get a hold of someone.
R:  Yeah, and you can -- you --
L:  I mean, look --
R:  Go ahead -- 
L:  If you look at like the mil- --
R:  -- I'm sorry.
L:  I was gonna say look at the military now, they're over in the middle of war and they're calling home and [NOISE] --
R:  That's true.  And they can, you know, even over the Internet you've got web cams and -- and ways to [MN] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to see people and -- and participate in family activities.
L:  [MN] Communication has grown so much that [NOISE] it's worth it, [NOISE] you know? [NOISE] And you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [inaudible] do that or if you travel overseas now, it's not a big deal.
R:  That's true.
L:  [inaudible] -- that postcard doesn't have the same meaning anymore. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. [LAUGH] Like, it doesn't have the novelty --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that -- that is true. [MN] I -- I don't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- know, now that we've talked I think, um, probably I would miss most my family.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think, like you say, you could adjust to their differences in culture and [MN] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the freedoms might be similar but [NOISE] --
L:  [MN] Well the good things would be the newness and getting to experience something completely new and having to learn the governmental systems and the laws and --
R:  Right, and education and -- and self worth and [MN] of course acquiring a job.  You might not need a job but [LAUGH] ...
L:  Yeah.  But you're moving to a whole new world.
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  Of course if they have --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- huge tax rates you may have to get a job.
R:  [MN] Yeah, yeah.  Some country, actually, you might be required to.
L:  Yup.
R:  Yeah, that is true.  I didn't think about that.
L:  Of course --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- are you going to be a -- become a citizen of that country or are you going to get kicked out?  I'd say, for you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to leave the U.S. you're gonna have to bounce from country to country.  [inaudible] --
R:  Well, yeah.
L:  -- permanent home.
R:  Yeah, if you couldn't have any new roots, that's true.  If you [MN] couldn't establish citizenship some place else, that would be difficult.
L:  [inaudible] single person do you leave or if you're married would it be easier, you know, that's another situation.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] I -- I guess for me personally, I -- the fact that I'm married I think [NOISE], you know, going with my husband would probably make the adjustment easier.  I would feel like I have, you know, someone there that I knew that I had chosen to be with.
L:  Sure. [MN]
R:  [MN]
L:  [MN]
R:  Of course you might not -- you might not go.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, and what happens if you get over there and people find out you got a million dollars?  Are they gonna like you for your money or are they gonna like you because you're you?
R:  That's true.  Yeah. [NOISE] And what do you do with that money when you're there, you know? [NOISE]
L:  Like, what if you blow that million dollars immediately? [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  You are so -- now you're in a foreign country and can't come back.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [inaudible].
R:  Maybe you could have, uh, you know, reconstructive facial surgery and new, you know, fingerprints and DNA and -- to come back? [LAUGH]
L:  I would, uh, you know, if I had to, I guess, I would make sure that I invested and lived off interest only if I didn't blow it.
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  And I would --
R:  That would probably --
L:  -- probably [inaudible] --
R:  -- be a wise thing to do.  Yeah.
L:  If you blow it and can never come back it could, you know --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, just to -- yeah, just to go [MN] and blow it, you know, without having some kind of a plan.
L:  [MN]
R:  [MN] Yeah, I -- I wonder.  I wonder, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, I mean, I know, for instance, uh, you know, my ancestors gave up their native country and came to the United States and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- became U.S. citizens but it wasn't like they could never go back. [NOISE]
L:  [MN]
R:  Although they never did.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I just wonder what that [MN] -- what that perspective -- how that would, uh, [LIPSMACK] play on a person's mind over time. [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, how you would -- you would deal with that. [NOISE] That -- that -- I think that would be a burden at times. [LAUGH]
L:  Sure. [MN] [inaudible] --
R:  Well, are -- are you a -- a single person or a married person?  Are you --
L:  Uh, [MN] --
R:  -- younger, older?
L:  Single person, almost thirty, so ...
R:  Almost thirty, yeah.
L:  [inaudible] --
R:  Yeah, you're about the same age as my son, my youngest son. [NOISE]
L:  Different perspective on it, but [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of course, you know, I -- I'd hope to have a million dollars eventually [NOISE] but [NOISE] ... A million dollars may not go that far in another country and it -- and it may.
R:  Well --
L:  [inaudible] may or may not --
R:  -- that's true.
L:  -- so [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it all depends, I guess.  If I -- 
R:  Yeah, [inaudible] --
L:  -- if -- if I had a friend who had a million dollars also to go with me [NOISE] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- or something like that, [inaudible] that'd be pretty tempting 'cause when you're young you're stupid and you're --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [inaudible].  But then I think in, you know, fifty years down the road, you know, when you want to settle down.
R:  Yeah. [MN] Well, and I think, you know, as you get older, too, you reflect back and [NOISE] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you wonder, you know, should I have?  Should I have taken that kind of a risk?  And when y- -- I guess when I was younger I'd do a lot of, like you say, stupid things without really thinking them through long term.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And if it kinda comes with -- with the territory and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know?  And -- and some of those turned out well, and some of 'em, [NOISE] you know, didn't.  It's not that I have any regrets but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [MN] leaving your country is a big decision. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  You realise what every si- -- what everyone died for and fought for and would you sell it out?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Would you be unpatriotic by doing that? [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  Is -- is that actually a form of treason? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Y -- you wonder.
L:  Ugh.  I guarantee you all the military people would hate ya.
R:  Yeah. [MN] Well, and I think, um, I think after the September eleventh events, I think a lot of [MN] -- [NOISE] a lot of Americans, young and old, [NOISE] [MN] really looked at, you know, what this country meant and what it -- what it gave us in terms of personal freedoms --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and [NOISE], uh, like you say, the protection from the laws and the court system. [NOISE]
L:  Exactly.  [inaudible] --
R:  And, uh --
L:  -- will never buy you happiness. [NOISE]
R:  [MN] No.  Uh-huh.  That's true.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And then if you stay and you think, "Well, I gave up [NOISE] a million bucks" [LAUGH] ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But like you say, you can earn that at, you know, in a lifetime.  Even by the time you're forty, depending upon what kind of a job you have, if you save it and [NOISE] ...
L:  Mhm. [MN] 
R:  [MN] 
L:  I don't know, I think leaving the U.S. for a million dollars, I'd definitely say no but I know people from countries that leave their country for a million dollars, and they'd come to the U.S.
R:  [MN] Well, that's true.  That is --
L:  Peop- --
R:  -- true.
L:  -- people aren't dying to get to other countries, they're dying to get in here.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I don't think -- that's not -- and they're -- they'll die for it so why -- why would I pay to never come back here?  And people are dying to get in here.
R:  That's true. [NOISE] That's a good point. [MN]
L:  Don't wanna leave. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] Yeah.  We have some, uh, some neighbors who, um, actually are, um, Vietnamese by birth and they came to this country [NOISE] I guess it was probably [SIGH] maybe the [MN] late seventies, early eighties [NOISE].
L:  Mhm.
R:  And eight of 'em lived in a two bedroom house.  You know, it was basically two families.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And gave up their country and their culture --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because of the opportunity they thought they -- they had here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, [NOISE] and -- and I look at them and I think, "God, what courage that took --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- to ..." [NOISE]
L:  Yeah. [MN] People come --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- over here without knowing the language and don't know anyone and they're willing to sacrifice it all so ...
R:  Yeah. [MN] And they often do better than people who've been [LAUGH] brought up in this country.
L:  Yeah.  Spoilt.
R:  Yeah. [MN] I'm -- I'm by a teacher by -- by trade --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and I have [MN] students who I think [inaudible] think that they just -- they take so much of it for granted.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Their education and -- and the opportunities that come their way as a result of just being a U.S. citizen. [NOISE]
L:  Mhm. [MN] What, uh --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- state are you from?
R:  [MN] I'm from Texas.  What city --
L:  From Texas? [MN]
R:  -- are you from?
L:  I'm up in Kansas.
R:  In Kansas?  That's where my --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- mother grew up.  In Liberal, Kansas.
L:  Yup.  I'm familiar with that. [MN]
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- so you're -- I'm sure you get a lot of Hispanics down or, you know, through your --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- area.
