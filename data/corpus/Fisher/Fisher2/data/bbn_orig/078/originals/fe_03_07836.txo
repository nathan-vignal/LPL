R:  General.
L:  In General. [MN] Um, [LIPSMACK] my experiences.  I've, uh, I've visited France a couple of times, li- --
R:  Wow, that sounds exciting. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I've just graduated college --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- it's an experience I suppose.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That is quite an interesting experience.
L:  What's that?
R:  That is interesting.  To get through college, that's big. [NOISE]
L:  [MN] Yeah.  So, wh- what -- what about you?  What are some of your experiences? [MN]
R:  Well, I've gone through high school, I'm a cosmetologist, I've studied computer, I took up medical billing, I've [NOISE] studied with Paula Dorf, where she does, uh, makeup artist for Barbara Streisand.
L:  Okay.

R:  Alexi!
L:  Is it Alexi?
R:  Alexi.  I think it's Alexs, I remember something about that.  Yes.
L:  Nice.  Nah, I was just --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- wondering. [NOISE]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.  So, wait, what was the, uh, what was the topic that we were -- that were given? [NOISE] I -- I didn't really hear it too well.
R:  It's just basically your ex- -- basically hypothetically speaking your --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- situation.
L:  Okay.
R:  Life.  Like, hypothetically, which is anything.  That's why I started it out with your experiences.
L:  Right, right, right.
R:  Because hypothetically speaking [NOISE] if you walk into, um, a bar, so to speak, and you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- happen to have the wrong substance on you, hypothetically speaking you will get in trouble [LAUGH], you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- what I mean? [LAUGH]
L:  Yup, yup, yup.
R:  What it basically means by hypothetically.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it also can be your experiences in life, too, because everything is kinda hypothetically speaking. [LAUGH]
L:  Well --
R:  -- if you -- if you think about it.
L:  Well, every -- ev- every planning for each step of your life is a hypothetical situation that you have to bring --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- to yourself [MN] to make the decision of what to do next.
R:  That's right. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  Where are you from?
L:  [NOISE] Um, I'm from Pittsburgh but I'm currentl- --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and I just moved out to Philadelphia.
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I love Pennsylvania.
L:  Yeah, Pennsylvania's nice.  In fact I --
R:  Yeah, some day I wanna move that way.  I love it.
L:  Where -- where -- where are you --
R:  I like --
L:  -- you live at?
R: -- Milford, Pennsylvania but anywheres around that area.  Pennsylvania's beautiful.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm from up, you know, um, let's see how to put it, where the Raceway is.  Upstate where the raceway is.
L:  Um, wait, Upstate --
R:  Monticello Raceway.
L:  I have no idea.
R:  Have you heard about it?
L:  Mm mm.
R:  Well, I'm like two and a half hours away from New York.
L:  Okay, okay.
R:  That gives you an idea, right?
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, the only places I really know there are, like, Ithaca and New York City pretty much.  
R:  Oh yeah, Ithaca's a big college state area.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.
R:  Very good.  Very interesting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And what --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- are you planning to do with your life.
L:  [MN] Well, uh, currently I'm looking for a job.  Actually, that's the way --
R:  [LAUGH] That's what we're --
L:  -- I got involved --
R:  -- we're always doing.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Especially, uh, right now. [MN] But --
R:  And what do you like?  Like, marketing or something with business?
L:  Um, no.  I -- I went into actually journalism with a minor --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  -- in French in, uh, in college and --
R:  Writing?
L:  -- I'm actually looking to work on possibly transcribing the film conversations to this study.
R:  Oh, very interesting.
L:  Yeah.  That's ho- -- that's how I got signed up with it. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So, uh --
R:  Very interesting.  Well [MN] --
L:  Yeah, I've a couple of friends who are doing that right now.
R:  Mhm.  And they like it?
L:  Yeah, yeah.  It's -- it's been run by Penn University.
R:  Yes, and that's why I thought it was so good.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Sounds really --
L:  So, uh --
R:  -- interesting.
L:  Yeah.  I live, like, uh, very close to Penn.  So --
R:  Mhm.  And you like it?
L:  Uh, the area?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  The area's great.
R:  Yeah.  Because I heard down in Pennsylvania's -- is really beautiful.  I -- I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- really love it. [MN]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, up here it's okay.  It just -- it seems more peaceful down there.  The people are nicer.
L:  Mhm.
R:  More generous.  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [MN]
L:  Yeah, uh, I think -- I think it gives --
R:  [NOISE] Aesthetically speaking, the area I come from, uh, I hate to say it, they're more cutthroat.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Even in the parks, when they take the park -- you know, my kid to the park, it's so different from that.
L:  Yeah.  Huh.
R:  You can't believe it.  You think people are people, that's not true. [NOISE]
L:  Aw.
R:  It does have a bearing in the area where they're from.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Um, also knowledge.  Some people have more knowledge, more college areas, people are more friendly, more outgoing. [MN] 
L:  [MN]
R:  That has a lot to do with it, knowledge.
L:  Y- you think so?
R:  Learning.  Absolutely.
L:  Hm.
R:  Because I'm not interested in going in the refrigerator and grabbing a beer and talking, uh, [MN] whatever small talk.  You know, I'm more intellectual.  I guess you could tell that.
L:  Right. [MN]
R:  When people are more intellectual, they're usually more outgoing, more helpful, more friendly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're not gonna use a situation whereas that type of person will use the situation.
L:  [MN] But I know a lot of intellectuals who are very introverted and [MN] very, uh --
R:  They can be because they weren't brought out but later in life probably you'll see they're not.  They're not going to be self centered like that. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  If they can use their mind.  That's another thing.
L:  Yeah. [MN] Of course.
R:  If your mind is closed in and you're looking to use it, it's not going to work either, right?
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um --
R:  So --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, I [MN] er, I don't know, I've only been up to, uh, New York a couple times and [MN] in -- in general I actually didn't -- I didn't find the, uh, [LIPSMACK] I didn't find the -- the brute -- the -- the curtness that people always talk about when they talk about people from New York. [MN] Uh, specifically New York City but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [MN] o- obviously you, uh, you're more north than that.
R:  Experienced it, unfortunately.  I'm not thrilled but [NOISE] maybe --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- because [MN] you know, if you're just visiting an area it's different, too. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  You know?  It's, like, you're looked upon and you look upon it as, "Well, I'm just here [MN] for a short while.  I'm going to be on my best [LAUGH] behaviour" kind of thing and people are going to be good to you.  It's a whole different ball game.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  When you live among them you see what they're really all about.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And unfortunately it's --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- not that nice.
L:  Yeah.  I, uh, I've got a couple of friends who moved up there, uh --
R:  Live up this way?
L:  Uh, moved up to --
R:  East?
L:  -- uh, just int- in- into, like, Queens and, uh --
R:  Queens area.
L:  -- Manhattan.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I had a grandmother from down that way.
L:  Ah.
R:  Um --
L:  [MN] W- would you prefer --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- to live near --
R:  [inaudible].
L:  -- the city or --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- or where you live now?
R:  What?  Say that again?
L:  Where -- would you prefer to live, like, closer to the city or where you are now?
R:  No, I don't prefer to live here. [MN] Um, close to the city because of everything that's going on, not exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] My dream is to be near Pennsylvania, believe it or not.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh.  Nice.
R:  That's my dream and I would really like to make it come true.
L:  Oh, you should just come down.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  [MN] [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's not that --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- easy, you know?
L:  [MN]
R:  Okay, you know, especially when you have roots.  It takes a lot to get out.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Takes money --
L:  It does.
R:  -- takes, uh, planning and it's a lot, you know?
L:  It takes -- it takes hypothetical situations.  You just gotta --
R:  [MN] Hypothetically speaking. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, it really does.
L:  Yeah. [MN] 
R:  Um [NOISE] ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Well --
L:  Hm. [NOISE]
R:  And do you have, um, a large family?
L:  What's that?
R:  Do you have a large family?
L:  Um, I have two older brothers and, uh, both my parents are still together.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's great.
L:  Yeah.  So, uh --
R:  That's what you would like some day, right?
L:  Uh, I don't know.  Actually right now I'm --
R:  Eventually, I mean.
L:  -- [MN] I'm in a currently a, uh --
R:  Like to stick with somebody, it sounds like you're right that, right?
L:  Well, yeah.  But, uh --
R:  You've been raised around that.
L:  I don't know.  I [MN], uh, currently I'm in a band and I don't really, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I -- I don't really foresee myself, uh --
R:  You wanna expand yourself --
L:  -- marrying --
R:  -- a little bit, right?
L:  What's that?
R:  You want to expand yourself first, I don't blame you.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Exactly.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Li- live my -- my, uh, young adulthood while I can.
R:  Well, that's being smart. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  'Cause once you tie yourself down --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's a whole thing different.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I've a lot of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- friends who are, uh, going out an getting married now and stuff and --
R:  Well, [LAUGH] it's great --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in one way.
L:  Yeah.
R:  In your old age I recommend it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  When you're hitting fifties.  Forty -- late forty and between forty and f- -- I recommend you do it.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Need [LAUGH] -- that's when you need somebody.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You need somebody to discuss things with and relate with, yes.
L:  Um.  How ol- -- how old are you?
R:  Forty two.
L:  Forty two?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Excellent.  Ex- --
R:  And you?
L:  Twenty two.
R:  What?  How old are you?
L:  Twenty two.
R:  Twenty two!  Yes --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- okay.  Well, there's not a lot of difference, really.
L:  Of -- not a lot of ... ?
R:  There's not a lot of difference in the forties.  The only -- the only difference is you've been through a lot more.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  And you can ob- -- see it more objectively but basically I'm a young kid at heart.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  I look young.  Nobody believes me I'm forty something.
L:  That -- that's --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- sort of what I've, uh, I've tried to study [MN] -- I've been -- I've been hanging out with a lot of older people right now.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Uh, mainly, like, uh, between twenty eight and thirty seven, around --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- that age.
R:  Yeah, I used to more --
L:  Uh, twenty five and thirty seven.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  And, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't know, I've just been noticing how they interact with each other and how a lot of it, you can tell they're still almost exactly the same intellectually, [MN] uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- as -- as people my age or even younger.
R:  Right.
L:  But at the same time you can tell they have, like, a different way of interacting with people [MN] where it's a little bit more reserved, it's a little --
R:  Right.
L:  -- bit more, uh, [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] you know, everything's held back --
