R:  [MN] A media consultant?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] Not quite sure.  Is that the business you're in?
L:  [MN] Uh, yes, actually, it is.  I'm an actress and a media consultant, uh, here in Atlanta, Georgia.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [MN] And, um, [LIPSMACK] I just finished a movie called Dumb and Dumberer.
R:  [LAUGH]

R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, I -- I hunt a lot, [MN] um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, getting out of grad school tomorrow.
L:  Oh, where -- where are you gonna -- where -- what grad school are you in now?
R:  SMU, uh, it's --
L:  [MN] Well, what -- what do you feel you've learned about being in business by having your own business?
R:  [MN] Well, it's not necessarily my own, I'm just the vice president of the company.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, uh, you know, this industry is, uh, is pretty competitive --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's also political, uh --
L:  Right. [MN] Now, according to the topic, if money's no object [MN] what other business would you open?
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [MN] That's a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- hard to tell.  I, you know, maybe a -- [MN] service business.
L:  Right.
R:  Uh --
L:  Would you [MN] -- would you put a, uh, another website on the Internet to start your business? [MN] How would you begin your new business?
R:  I don't know if it would be on the website, more maybe consulting type business and I'd start it, uh, kind of via word of mouth, uh, my --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- own felicitation. [MN] So, d- -- what kind of business do you think you would set up?
L:  [MN] Um, just a media consulting business on the Internet, um, and also just locally.
R:  Mhm. [MN] D- --
L:  Which of course, uh, I'm doing right now but, um, [MN] if money were no object I'd, uh, [SIGH] probably, uh, also have a travel, uh, business as well.
R:  [MN] Okay.
L:  [MN] And that's where --
R:  [MN] Piggy -- 
L:  -- I would --
R:  -- piggybacked on the same --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- website or ... ?
L:  [MN] No, I -- I would like to -- I would need to spend some time travelling to places that I haven't been to yet so I could --
R:  uh-huh.
L:  -- advise other people about where to go.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And of course it's -- because we're in World War Three, it's, you know, our places to go and feel safe are limited.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think a good place for Americans to go would -- would be the islands.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] Um, [MN] and [inaudible] like Saint Lucia where we're still relatively liked.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, also maybe the Fiji islands.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, let's see [NOISE], I think most of the islands, of course Cuba, uh, after Fidel Castro dies which shouldn't be soon, I think Cuba will open up for us, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to go back to 'cause [NOISE] in nineteen fifty two Cuba was like a little Las Vegas --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for us.  And again, [NOISE] um, you know, travel, uh, for right now is, you know, a little more limited for Americans, um, you know, it, um, [MN] I mean obviously I think, most people who want to go to Israel or Palestine should have their head examined.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I mean, you know, it -- it would be -- the Holy Land would be a great place to see but not right now. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  Pretty -- pretty volatile over there.
L:  Of course, you know, it -- it's very funny, it's always been a volatile place so, you know, um, [NOISE] but if [NOISE] object, uh, I would like to travel with a group and just make out a big list of what are the best places to go see [NOISE] and the best entertainment, uh, around the world, y- you know, if money's no object. [MN] And that means of course, uh, we'd need some bodyguards to travel with us for that reason.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] But, um, I think going on safari might be an interesting thing to do.  I've never been on safari, have you?
R:  [MN] No, I had a chance once, uh, but it fell through so I actually -- that summer I stayed abroad in Japan, so ...
L:  What -- what would be your favorite place to travel?
R:  [MN] Well --
L:  Right now.
R:  -- [COUGH] actually, I'm -- my wife and I are quite fond of, uh, the Caribbean and, uh --
L:  Caribbean?  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yes.
R:  We really enjoy --
L:  I --
R:  -- Playa Del Carmen, which is south of, uh, I guess Cozumel. And, uh --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  It's [MN] just pretty inexpensive and it's just quite relaxed and the water's beautiful and it's just peaceful.  There's no hustle and bustle because you're not in the big city you're just --
L:  Right.
R:  -- on the beach.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I ki- -- I kinda like that, um --
L:  Right.
R:  A safari type trip would be nice --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- as well.
L:  Yeah.  If I start my new business are you gonna hire me?
R:  [PAUSE] Oh, as a consultant?  It'd be --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- it -- I possibly will.
L:  Okay.
R:  You never know.
L:  Well, my phone number is four zero four --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- three six eight three four four four, okay?  So, if you come to Atlanta give me a call and I'll show you around town.
R:  All right, that sounds great.
L:  [NOISE] So --
R:  Yeah, so are you speaking on a cellphone?
L:  Yeah, I sure am.
R:  Okay. [MN] 'Cause I heard some clicking and I was like, "Wait a second".  I, uh [MN] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, do you have --
R:  So --
L:  Huh?
R:  So, this -- so this mo- -- you were in this movie, what role --
L:  It was filmed right --
R:  -- did you play?
L:  -- here in Atlanta, Georgia.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  And, um, I -- I -- do you like good comedy? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay, well that's good. [MN] So, um, [NOISE] what, uh, [MN] what kind of laptop and what kind of wireless system do you recommend to people starting up their new business?
R:  [MN] Well, I think, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the history of computers we had, I think Compaq work pretty good.
L:  Right.
R:  Um --
L:  So, of course, money's no object here in this topic --
R:  Yeah, Compaq --
L:  So, you w- -- you would -- you would recommend Compaq.
R:  Compaq or Dell.  Dell is actually [MN] --
L:  Or Dell, okay.
R:  [MN]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Dell is a little more expensive so I might go that route plus you can customize your computer that way.
L:  [NOISE] And I tell you what I read today which seemed to be helpful, [MN] there's, uh -- Sprint has come out with, uh, something you can plug into your laptop to empower it.
