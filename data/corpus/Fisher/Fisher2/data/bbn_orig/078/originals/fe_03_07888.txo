L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hi, I'm Brian.
L:  Hi, Brian, I'm Donna.
R:  Hi, Donna.  Uh, did you hear the topic --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I thought, uh, if you was offered a million dollars you couldn't speak to --
L:  You --
R:  -- there's a stipulation you can't speak to your best friend again?
L:  You g- -- yes I did, that's --
R:  Wha- --
L:  -- strange.
R:  Wha- wha- what do you think about that, huh?
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I say hard  --it -- [LAUGH] considering my financial situation, it would -- I have to admit, it would be very, very tempting, although [NOISE] I know ethically, um, to me it would be wrong.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I, uh -- do I hear a baby in the background?
L:  Actually I do. [LAUGH] She -- she's a one year old lying on my lap.
R:  Yeah -- why -- you -- that --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- that -- is that your child?
L:  Uh, one of quite a -- one of quite a few.
R:  One of quite a few, huh?
L:  Yeah, stay at home mom.
R:  Oh.  Where does the, uh -- I don't -- I don't think I -- I don't think I would be able to do that.  I don't think I would be able to not speak to my best friend again if I was offered a million dollars, even though it would be tempting though, you know.
L:  It would be.
R:  Like, you say, ethically it's -- it's -- it's -- it wouldn't be right, you know what I mean?
L:  Um, y- you know what, I have actually heard, uh -- when I think about this, um -- a lot of people that win a lot of money or are given a lot of money, um, actually go through it, um, quite fast and then -- and say they wouldn't believe how fast they go through it anyway.
R:  What's that, a m- -- a million dollars?
L:  A million dollars, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Well, you know, a -- a million dollars is not really a lot of money these times anyway.
L:  No.
R:  It's not really a lot of money, you know what I mean, so I think, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- really, if they was to offer, like, about ten million dollars, it might be a little bit different.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, uh, there're a couple of things that the topic didn't address and one is, [NOISE] you know, I guess, is your best friend really your best friend --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- forever and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- uh, and I have, in fact, had a -- I have had somebody I thought was my best friend in the last two years that turned around to be my worst enemy.
R:  What?
L:  Uh, in that -- in that case I would probably be very sorry that I didn't accept the money because I could do a lot with that money, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- f- for my -- for me and for my kids and I -- you know, after then I would probably do a lot for other people who have good uses for the money.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, going back to just a best friend and right now probably my best friend is my own mom.  Um, the answer then would definitely be no.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I couldn't, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I -- I couldn't go for that.
R:  Well, the topic did not address -- it didn't address, uh -- uh, is your best friend your best friend -- true blue, best friend is your best friend for [MN] -- for life --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or your best friend forever, it did not address that.  So, right now at the present time, for me, I, uh -- you know, it didn't address, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- also that you -- do you have a best friend in your life right now -- it did not address that.
L:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
R:  So, right now for me, I don't -- I don't have a best friend in my life right now, so for me it wouldn't be -- it wouldn't be no problem for me to take the million dollars, you know what I mean?
L:  It wouldn't be that crucial.
R:  It wouldn't be -- it wouldn't be no problem -- problem at all for me because I don't have a best friend right now in my life.
L:  Well, here is another thing that just entered my mind and that's, um, [LIPSMACK] uh, in the million dollars -- uh, tax issues, because I've just recently, uh, entered a few contests, thinking wouldn't it really be nice to, uh -- to win an appliance or a trip or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- something, just really exciting --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just -- just for the sake of winning it and then I got to wondering, uh, [NOISE] about, uh, [NOISE] taxes.  In fact, I heard of somebody who actually said they turned a trip back in, uh, because the taxes were high and they couldn't transfer it to a friend or transfer back in for cash value.  And the cash value on it was, uh, [NOISE] probably a lot more than the trip was actually worth.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  And, uh, I don't know where you are -- are located but, uh, [NOISE] I'm, uh, uh, somewhere near the North and South Carolina border --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, uh, they have a lottery in South Carolina, as of this past year, and I know a lot of local people who try to get the lottery tickets and -- and win the money, [NOISE] uh, in fact some of my family, although [NOISE] I haven't.  Uh, my philosophy is basically, if you're meant to have something and you're living the life that you should, then you're just going to accept that and just handle whatever comes your way.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  Well, you know something, I, uh -- I -- I'm really a, um, [LIPSMACK] um, uh, you know, I -- you have a accent too, I wanted to tell you that.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, I know I do, without a doubt. I lived in --
R:  It's a -- it's a very southern --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- very southern accent, huh.
L:  Very twangy, I'm sure.  I lived, uh --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I lived in south eastern Pennsylvania for a short time and, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- as soon as I open my mouth people knew the part of the country that I was from. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, you have a very -- I -- I'm -- I'm from Pennsylvania, matter of fact, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
L:  Where?
R:  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
L:  Pittsburgh, I know a lot of really great people from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
R:  Yeah, that's -- that's -- that's where I from right now, yeah.
L:  Have you anybody -- anybody from Pittsburgh is usually happy [NOISE] -- uh, happy to be from there too.
R:  Yeah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- well you know something --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I tell you what --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- considering -- considering that I'm in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Pittsburgh right now and I don't have a best friend, that million dollars would do me some justice, you know what I mean?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It would -- it -- it would really --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- do me a lot of justice and everything, you know.
L:  Yeah --
R:  I --
L:  -- I -- I -- I would say, yeah, that given that -- given that scenario, um, I would have to make my -- my initial -- my initial answer would be, "No, I keep my friend".
R:  Mhm.
L:  Just -- I think it's the morally right thing to do, but given some thought it really would depend on all the circumstances.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I --
R:  I guess, hypothetically speaking, what they were saying if -- if you did have a best friend in your life right now -- if you did have a best friend and they was your best friend and you're offered a million dollars but the only stipulation was you couldn't talk or see your best friend again, that's wh- -- I guess that's what the, uh -- th- the topic --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- was -- I was really trying to address was, uh, that you t- -- hello, hello --
L:  Yes, yes.
R:  -- that you did have a best friend, if you -- it -- it -- it got real quiet all of a sudden I could hardly --
L:  Oh, I know, I'm changing rooms here --
R:  Okay, okay.
L:  -- get real little -- little -- get rid of some background --
R:  Okay, yeah.
L:  Uh, you know, um, uh, you're really putting a price on friendship too if you say, "Well, I, uh -- I wouldn't do it for a million but I would do it for this".
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] It's like -- it's like [NOISE] having a child and, "Well, I'd do it for this, I wouldn't do --" I wouldn't do -- I wouldn't accept anything regarding the welfare of my children.
R:  Mhm.
L:  No, that you couldn't put any price on would I do this or would I not do that.
R:  That's right.  You know, what if the topic was, uh, wh- -- if -- if -- if -- if you were offered five hundred million dollars to give up your kids, would you do it?
L:  Mm, yeah, there is not -- there's not but one answer. [LAUGH] Even whe- -- even when they drive me crazy.
R:  And the answer is, "No".
L:  N- -- the answer is, "No, definitely not".
R:  No, it -- I wouldn't -- you could not give me a billion dollars to give up my kids, you know.  I just -- I wouldn't do it and, uh, if my friends, my true blue, best friend -- and we went through a lot things together and we'd been there for each other -- there's no price you could give me -- no amount of money you could give me that would make me not speak or see my friend again either.
L:  Well, yeah, and I -- I have discussed this with other people -- discussed friendship, and we all come down to -- you can know a lot of people in your lifetime but you can really count your best friends, usually, on one hand.
R:  That's very true.
L:  Uh, so in that case they really are hard to come by.
R:  Yeah, that -- that's very, very true.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, so -- so how is it down there in -- in -- in Carolina though?  How, uh -- do you like it down there?
L:  Uh, outside of, uh, living in Pennsylvania for a little while, I've lived in this general area all my life [NOISE] and it's really nice to visit another area of the country.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, no matter what you hear or watch on television, you really need a good grasp of it by going there --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, uh, generally, I do like this area.  I'd like to travel more but I do like this area and speaking of money too, I get the idea that the cost of living is somewhat reasonable here even though sales tax continues to climb --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, uh, the climate is pretty good and, um, there's enough good, local entertainment, um, and a lot of people from other areas, especially in the north, have been moving here for years.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, it's a -- it's a growing area too.
R:  Oh, so the cost of living a little higher than, uh, Pittsburgh down there, or a little lower?
L:  I think it's actually lower.  When I lived near Philadelphia I saw, like, just the cost of housing, groceries, everything was so much lower here.
R:  Mm, I guess -- I guess, uh, being, uh -- up -- up in Philadelphia, I guess a million dollars could have did you some justice, huh?
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Huh.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, in fact, I -- when I sold my house and moved north, I -- I checked in to see what kind of house I could buy for the same money and definitely not as much.  So, a lot of people move from the north to the south and they actually gain by moving here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They could do more with the money they come here with.
R:  You know what else the topic didn't address?  The topic didn't address -- also down there was, uh, it said -- it stated that if -- if you're offered a million dollars, uh, um to n- -- offered a million dollars not to speak or talk to your best frie- -- see or speak to your best friend again, but what if you're already a multi millionaire? [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay, well --
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  -- you know, that's like -- you know, I -- uh, that's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a great thing to bring up --
R:  Or what if you're are in -- what if you're already filthy rich, you don't need that million, y- y- y- --
L:  You don't need that.
R:  -- you don't need the million dollars -- you don't need --
L:  You know what -- yeah, so that would come into play with, uh, how -- how much in need you are of that money --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- that might influence your decision.
R:  Exactly.  And -- and eve- and even if you're not a multi millionaire, if you're just a millionaire, you're just well off still, you know, you wouldn't necessarily -- you really don't need that money, so ...
L:  Yeah, if it's money what -- you know, going back to family again, if you need a little or a great sum of money for say an operation for a child, then that might be more important and you would be inclined to say, "I'll take the money".
R:  Yeah, yeah, see -- it also think that the topic didn't address a few things, if you were offered the money but you couldn't speak to your best friend again and or see your best friend again, uh, but your child was in need, uh, of a serious operation --
