L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  I'm Sa- -- good, how are you?  My name is Sarah.
R:  I'm Cindy.
L:  How are you?
R:  Real good. [LAUGH]
L:  Um, [COUGH] okay, so our topic [LAUGH] -- how do you draw the line [LAUGH] between acceptable -- what is it, acceptable humor and --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and not acceptable?
R:  Um, the way I smile.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Very much.  You can change, uh, see by the expression on my face and my smile becomes more, uh, like, straight.
L:  Right.
R:  And that.  And I'll start, uh, flashing my e- eyes downward.
L:  Huh.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And if gets a little too raunchy then I'll speak up and say that, you know, I don't think it's appropriate.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  I'm very, uh, articulate on using my words.  I don't like to embarrass myself.
L:  Right.
R:  But I will if it's out of hand or -- let's say -- okay, I'm white and if it's a black jokes and there's blacks among me, there's some where you can draw a line on and, you know, it is funny --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but then there's other ones where, you know, it's getting a little raunchy and I'll speak up because I don't like anything that's prejudice or degrading.
L:  [LIPSMACK] That's how I am too.  I will flat out tell people, I'm like, "Look, that's not cool".
R:  Mmm.
L:  You know, my [COUGH] -- and I'm white too and I [MN] -- I don't think that racial humor is funny.
R:  Some of it I do.
L:  Some things are funny like --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- because if you think about -- if you think about it more you can kind of make those same generalizations about everyone.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, when it's -- when it -- it's funny when it's like that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But I'm the same way.  Like, I have really -- like, I can be -- I have a really dirty sense of humor sometimes, you know?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] But of course, I mean, you just know --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- depending on your company, like, who you can say certain things around and you just, you know, gauge it from that.
R:  Mm.
L:  I -- I don't think that I've ever had like, a situation where I've been really out of line and anyone's had to say anything or anyone said anything like, you know, to someone else about it or anything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I -- I feel like I've done a pretty good job in my lifetime of, you know, gauging the appropriateness of -- of things, based on my company.
R:  Mhm.  I've been pretty lucky because when I ask for it to be stopped it has been stopped.  And it's like, I see a relief on other people's faces when I do speak up.
L:  Right.
R:  And that.  But then I'm very slow to get the punch lines.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I just heard a joke last week and I had to ask the guy like, six times what the punch line meant.  I had --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- never heard that terminology.
L:  Right.
R:  And the guy that I was dating at the time just looked at me so dumbfounded it's like, you know, the joke was more on me than the joke itself.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
R:  So I end up put in the situation where I was highly embarrassed but it's like, you know, everybody's laughing, they know what the punch line is and I never heard of that word or that phrase and it's like, you know, "I don't know!"
L:  Right.  That's not your fault!
R:  [SIGH] Right.  "I've never been exposed to it, I've led a very sheltered life" you know, that was how I got out of it to save --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- my dignity.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I -- I understand that.
R:  But then when we were coming home, I asked him, "What did the punch line mean?" and he just looked at me like, "Are you stupid or what?"
L:  Oh no.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Are you still dating him? [SIGH]
R:  No.
L:  Okay, good! [LAUGH] 
R:  No, no, no. [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause you don't want that kinda look from anybody.
R:  No.  And to be told that, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, don't you think you could just give me a little decency and explain it?
L:  I know.  If it's so hilarious.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Share the laugh, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  And not be snotty about it.
R:  And also when people get overbearing and tell one joke right after the other.
L:  Well yeah.
R:  And don't let anybody else get a chance in edgewise.
L:  "Slow down, I got some good ones too".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know.
R:  Not only that but it's an ice breaker.
L:  Yeah, it is.  'Cause it should lead to more conversation.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know.  I'm not a big joke teller myself but [COUGH] -- it's more -- I'm more of like, a -- like a timed comment maker.
R:  Okay.
L:  You know?  Like [LAUGH] I was a kid in high school that got kicked out of the class 'cause if there was a movie we were watching I'd have all the zingers for the people in the movie, you know?
R:  Oh gosh! [LAUGH]
L:  I was that kid, so --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I -- I don't have -- I'm not like a -- I'm not a good storyteller.  But I'm a -- I'm a one liner.
R:  Mm. [LAUGH]
L:  And sometimes those can get you in trouble.
R:  Yes they can. [LAUGH]
L:  You know.  But sometimes they're funnier than any joke could be.
R:  Yes.  Do you ever get the silent giggles?  Where your mouth --
L:  Oh my God.
R:  -- just hangs open?
L:  Yes.
R:  And you c- -- you can't do nothing about it and nobody -- it's like -- it's a situation where you're looking at the best of it and you're in the worst possible situation and you just start laughing and you get those chest cramps.
L:  Oh, it's the worst -- its' always the worst time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's always the worst time.
R:  And everybody else is getting mad.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because, you know, "What's -- what's the humor in it? What's so funny?" and you can't stop.
L:  You're like, "Nothing, [LAUGH] that's the point" [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  And then you can't say nothing 'cause you're -- you're laughing so hard and you're gulping for breath and you're snorting 'cause you can't breathe! [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm, mhm.  And your stomach hurts so bad.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah [NOISE].
L:  But --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that's the best laugh though.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's the best kind, when your stomach hurts.
R:  Uh-huh, 'cause --
L:  My --
R:  -- they're genuine.
L:  Yeah.  My roommate and I went to, um, like a seminar like, for writing letters for school or whatever, a couple of years ago, and it was just the dumbest thing in the world.  All the stuff was like [MN] all the things that they were telling us was really like, duh!
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  You know.  So we were writing notes back and forth to each other and before we even started writing the notes I got the giggles.
R:  Oh my gosh.
L:  I was cracking up, my face was like, paralyzed.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I was laughing so hard, and I was trying not to bring any attention to me, it was like, seriously, one of the funniest times in my life and there was absolutely nothing to laugh at.
R:  Wow.
L:  You know?
R:  How do you react, uh, when you hear a joke and it's not funny?
L:  I'm like --
R:  I mean, it's really --
L:  -- "Oh yeah, good one".
R:  -- dense.  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I pretend.
R:  Do ya?
L:  Yeah, 'cause, you know, the person thinks, "Oh, I'm gonna tell this joke" you know, "I'm gonna make people laugh".  I -- I, you know, do the best I can to --
R:  Okay. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- to fulfil their little fantasy, you know?
R:  [LAUGH] But then how do you stop 'em when they keep going and going?
L:  [COUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I interrupt.
R:  [SIGH] Oh.
L:  You know, tell one of my own.
R:  I'm not that brave, I'll walk away, but I won't interrupt.
L:  Yeah, it depends.  Like, if I -- well, it depends on what situation, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- everything -- like, I keep thinking about work and I'm like, you know, things at work when I have [inaudible] customers or whatever --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- trying to tell me stuff that's funny, think it's the funniest thing in the world, you know?  And I can't get away from 'em! [LAUGH]
R:  You find different age groups that you're easier to laugh at jokes with?  Like, the older people, you do -- you laugh at their jokes because it might be their only form of communication with another person for the day?
L:  Oh totally, totally.  That's just -- that's just [MN] same kind of thing that I was saying, like, you know, people tell jokes 'cause they wanna make other people laugh 'cause it makes them feel good.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know. [COUGH]  And, uh, I -- you know, you can tell when somebody just wants to make you happy.
R:  Yes.
L:  You know.  And I'll give it to 'em even though [LAUGH] --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- it might not be necessarily be completely sincere on my part --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's sincere that, you know, I want them to -- I want them to think that I was happy.  And the whole thing like, ends up being a happy situation.  I may not have laughed hysterically but, you know, I did definitely --
R:  It comes across as doing your good deed for the day.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that kinda thing, that kinda thing.
R:  Have you ever been in a situation where somebody just starts rattling off jokes and it's like, you wish you had a tape recorder 'cause they were so funny?
L:  Oh my God, yeah.
R:  And you're just bombarded where you -- you remember the punch line to one but you remember +beginning of a joke to another and it's like, you try to tell it and you just garbled it all off?
L:  Yep, you just can't get it right, yeah.
R:  Or you don't want 'em to stop.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's like you're gonna follow 'em, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Get another one --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- out there.
L:  [LIPSMACK] I know, I love that.  My friends and I used to carry around a video camera.
R:  Oh really?
L:  And just randomly tape like, us sitting on the couch.  We used to make [MN] -- it's so dumb, we used to make prank phone calls, which is really mean.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But it was so much fun [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And the only part that was funny was what my friend was saying like, we didn't really get anyone, we didn't even care what the person said on the other line.
R:  Okay.
L:  But this one friend of mine was so funny, like, she couldn't be stopped.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  And she never like, you know, went out of her way to like, make anyone feel bad, like, her jokes weren't like, weren't those kind of jokes, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  They weren't at the expense of whoever was on the other line.
R:  Right.
L:  But she would make herself out to be the dumbest person in the world.  So it was always so funny 'cause we'd call like, businesses and stuff.
R:  [SIGH] Oh my gosh!
L:  Yeah, yeah, it was fun.
R:  That's pretty brave. [LAUGH]
L:  I know!  I n- -- I could never do it but she was so good at it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So good at it.  It was a good time.
R:  So what kinda -- of, um, I know this is called the Fisher Project.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The Un- -- the University of Pennsylvania.  What is your, um --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- class that you got involved in this with?
L:  Nothing, I found it on the internet.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Yeah.  Did you -- did you get involved through a class?
R:  No.  No, I did it through the internet also.
L:  Yeah, I found it on Craig's List.
R:  [COUGH] Wow.
L:  I live in Boston and I was just looking for like, part time jobs and I came across it and I was like, "Hey, all right".
R:  Great.
L:  "Sounds good to me".  Hm.
R:  I wonder what the study, you know, what the outcome is?
L:  I know, I'd like to know.  I'd like to be, you know, I'd hope that they would update us on that -- on that, 'cause it's interesting, you know, like --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I think that -- I mean, [MN] like maybe it has something to do with robots. [LAUGH]  I don't know, I'm on a big robot kick right now 'cause I just watched that show on like, the Discovery Channel or something about robots --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and like, how far they've come.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] And how little they can really do.  Compared to people obviously, still, but they have come really far.  Um [COUGH] I don't know, like how people interact in the whole conversation part of, you know, human interaction.
R:  Yeah, could be that too.
L:  Maybe like, trying to like, teach robots how to think.
