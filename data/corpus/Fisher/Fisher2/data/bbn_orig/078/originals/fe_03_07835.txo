R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  Um, I'm Wendy from California.
R:  Uh, I'm Cathy from Georgia.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  All the way across.
L:  Yeah, about as far as we can get almost! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yes.  Uh, as far as the question, uh, no, I don't believe I would leave the country.
L:  Yeah, I don't do enough traveling outside to know where I would go if I did leave. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, i- if -- well, I guess you look at it, if you leave the country, I mean, it's more dangerous nowadays overseas than it is in here so I may get the million, move overseas and end up getting killed anyway, so [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, but the cost --
R:  -- I'm safer here.
L:  Yeah, the cost of living could be a lot less though.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The million could pretty much set you ... up forever.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I guess.
R:  Oh yeah.  Yeah, i- i- it could do that, it's just I'd worry about [NOISE] where I could go in order to be able to spend it.
L:  Yeah, I -- I agree.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think the -- the -- the climate of travel and -- and other l- locations is not as good as it was.  Maybe five years ago if had been asked that question I probably --
R:  Right.
L:  -- would say -- I may -- I may have said yes.
R:  Right.  And it's like you said, it'd be, uh, you know, where would you go ... that you would be comfortable and you would fit and would be able to adapt ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to their way of living?  So --
L:  Y- yeah. [NOISE]  Well, what would you miss if you went?
R:  Uh, if I went, well it would have to be family, of course, unless I j- -- I -- if I had to go by myself, yeah, it would be family.  Unless I could take them all with me.
L:  Yeah, I would -- I would be tempted to take everyone with me. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah! [LAUGH]  I would -- I would have to do that 'cause I have two kids so I would definitely have to take them with me.  And of course my parents, I still have those [NOISE] around so I'd have to take them with me and ...  Lord, it'd probably cost me that much to move everybody. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that many people, right! [LAUGH]
R:  I probably wouldn't be able to.
L:  Yeah, moving -- moving isn't cheap, I think a million isn't enough [LAUGH] --
R:  No, no.
L:  -- anymore. [LAUGH]
R:  It -- it sounds like a lot if you were --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it was just you, if you were single and there was no one, had no family, have no friends --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- yeah, that'd be -- it'd be a lot easier to do it that way.  But, yeah, if you had to -- all these friends, I mean, you know, you -- you don't wanna leave 'em behind.
L:  Yeah, it would be har- -- I think it would be [MN] -- I think it's probably your friends, you know, family, like they'll keep coming and visiting you but friends are even harder.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And going to a new country where you don't know anybody.
R:  Great.  And then go over there with money you may not have those real friends anymore.
L:  That's true, that's right, 'cause they just want you for your money.
R:  That's right.  And I wouldn't want anyone to want me for that, so -- or use me.  And I know these, where I live, I live in a small town so, uh, we don't know much about having a lot of money so [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- they don't use anybody for money around here, so ...
L:  [NOISE] But what if you could find somewhere like that?
R:  If I could find somewhere like this?
L:  Yeah, somewhere that didn't look at people for their money.
R:  That would probably be a lot different, it'd be like a adventure, you know, like when people travel, you know.  The only problem is, I wouldn't never be able to come back so ...
L:  Yeah, that's sort of an odd carry on.  I was like, well, you c- -- you can move to Canada, it wouldn't be that different, you know, and [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- come down and visit but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you can't ever come back. [LAUGH]
R:  I know, that'd be ... be like -- a- and I'm used to warm weather so that they'd really have to find somewhere warm ...'cause I'm not used to the -- the snow and ...
L:  Yeah, you have to move closer to the equator or something! [LAUGH]
R:  That's right. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Somewhere like Hawaii but then I'd be [inaudible] if I did go on the water one day, so [LAUGH] ...
L:  Yeah --
R:  And then the --
L:  -- it's too bad Hawaii is still part of the US, that could be --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the place to move to.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I was thinking about --
R:  I --
L:  -- all the islands, you know, there's a lotta like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- Caribbean islands.  I'm like, well that wouldn't be so bad.
R:  Yeah, then you'd worry about the hurricanes.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And I could stay in the --
L:  Well don't you have some of that in Georgia? [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, huh?
L:  Don't you have some of that in Georgia? [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, we have some in Georgia but usually they -- it's just wind and rain, they don't actually go across us [LAUGH] like they would on a island.
L:  Oh yeah, that's true.
R:  You know, island, they actually will go across and they turn around and come back across you.  But in Georgia we -- we get rain but, you know, usually it'll hit and it'll die down before it goes too far up end of Georgia.  It still has to get through Florida and Alabama and South Carolina and places like that.
L:  And you h- -- and you hope that at least it dies down a little bit by the time it gets to you.
R:  Right.  Right, yeah, it usually does that.  So that's, you know, the weather.  The weather play a -- a -- a big thing on it 'cause I -- I don't like -- I don't really cold weather but I don't like really hot weather either, and so as far as where I live, in Georgia, it -- it gets cold but not too cold.
L:  And it gets hot but not too hot?
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, it gets hot but not too hot, like, Florida's too hot.  And, you know, up further north it's too cold and I just -- I can't handle that -- they'd have to have somewhere that had, you know, year round seventies, eighties. [LAUGH]  That -- now that I would consider. [LAUGH]  Be like one big vacation I guess.
L:  Yeah.  I don't know if I'm old enough to think that I want a lifetime vacation yet. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, right
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Uh right. [LAUGH]  But it'd be nice to know that I -- I could do it.
L:  Yeah, 'cause you'd have that --
R:  So I guess that would be the one thing.  But having the million is you can take that ... put it in savings somewhere and get interest and live off the interest for the rest of your life.
L:  Yeah, [inaudible] probably get an account that'll earn you enough interest these days. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  I think in a million we could probably handle that. [LAUGH]  [MN] when you think about what little bit we live on now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Off of just, you know, a weekly pay.  A million, I'm -- I'm sure I could live off the interest on that 'cause I know that's gotta be more than what I make in a month now.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that, uh ...  I'd -- I would probably -- the only thing I'd probably miss is the, uh, be my friends and family and all.  Other than that, you know, they're -- if I could take 'em all with me and -- they could get jobs.
L:  [LAUGH] They could support you, right?  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  I'd just put my million in savings and they could support me and -- I'd move but as far as where I'd move, I don't know.
L:  I don't know where I'd move either.  I don't -- like I said, I don't do enough international travel to find that perfect place yet.
R:  I don't either.  I mean, as far as traveling or as far as checking out any traveling --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's always in the US, you know, and it's usually --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a couple of states away or ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And -- and that's it.
L:  That sounds like me. [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I go down to about, uh, north Florida, maybe, uh, this side of Alabama and that's just a part of my [inaudible], that's all the traveling I do.  I don't travel much at all.  Yeah, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Y- well, yeah, and like if you look at the -- the way that they live overseas, you know, different ways of living.  And of course you'd have to look at their rules and regulations, could you do that, you know.
L:  I was thinking about Australia maybe.
R:  Go and see the kangaroos?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] That'd be something I've never done.
L:  Yeah, I've never been there.  It seems like a nice place.  I have --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, I met some people online and stuff that are from there ... th- that seem nice enough, but they do say that everything's expensive there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Cars and stuff.  Like double or triple what we pay here.
R:  Darn.
L:  So that, you know, that's --
R:  But --
L:  -- a -- one nice car, that's your million dollars right? [LAUGH]
R:  Oh [LAUGH] yeah!  Yeah, it's a -- it probably is a whole nother world over there so -- I mean, if I had to -- to decide, I mean, like, you know, like I said, if it was just like me and my family, that'd be really hard to do, I mean, you'd h- -- of course you'd have to sit there and go, "Well, you know, I could send my kids to college" [SIGH].
L:  Yeah, private schools --
R:  As --
L:  -- the whole bit.
R:  Yeah.  But then you gotta think, "But, if I come to college, I can't come back if they come back".
L:  That's true.
R:  So, you know, like, what if they come back to the US and there I'm stuck and --
L:  Yeah, and you can't come back visit them, they have to come visit you every time.
R:  That right. [LAUGH]  And I [several inaudible words] hold out that long!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's, uh, it's expensive and then I wouldn't -- I wouldn't necessarily want to fly.  I don't like to fly now so --
L:  Yeah, we do mostly driving out here too.
R:  Yeah, I'm -- I'm not big into flying so -- and I'm not really big into boats, going that far, so --
L:  Well Canada might be okay.
R:  Do what?
L:  Canada.
R:  Yeah.  That -- that's probably that way I don't have to -- I don't have to get on a boat.
L:  Yeah, you can --
R:  And I --
L:  drive! [LAUGH]
R:  -- I can just drive and --
L:  Take your million dollars and drive to Canada.
R:  That's right, I can afford the gas! [LAUGH]
L:  A million dollars worth of gas card please.
R:  [LAUGH] That's right.  [LAUGH] Yeah, you could really --
L:  'Cause it seems like --
R:  -- trip somebody out on that one.
L:  'Cause it seems pretty, uh, a lot more similar to our economic and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and living conditions in Canada than it does in other places.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a -- it's a lot of the same.  You know, they -- like you said, uh, they have a lotta the same living and it's -- you know, except for the weather of course, that's totally different, but they do a lot that we do, they come down here, we go up there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's not the same as going across seas.  You know, overseas that'd be a whole -- whole different world.
L:  Yeah, at least they have mostly the same language and stuff too, so --
R:  Yeah, 'cause you're looking at, by the time you get there, well the, uh, the climate's changed.  It's winter in some of those places --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- so whereas it's summer here --
L:  Yeah, but, uh, like, Australia's the exact opposite where we are now.
R:  Mm.
L:  So it's just starting summer, so it's just starting winter there.
R:  I know, and -- yeah, and then you go the -- that's just -- that's really weird.  But some of those, uh, the pla- -- the climate pretty much stays the same
