R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello, my name --
L:  Hello.
R:  Are you there?
L:  Yes.
R:  My name is Lyle.
L:  Hi, Lyle, I'm EJ.
R:  Hello.
L:  I'm from -- in San Francisco.
R:  I'm in Kansas.
L:  Oh, wow.  You're up late. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, not really. [LAUGH]
L:  So, what are your thoughts on what you would have changed if you'd time traveled?
R:  Um, if I had to change something?
L:  Yeah, it says what would you personally change if you would -- could go back in time?
R:  Um, something I'd personally change I'd probably go to school somewhere different.
L:  Where did you go to school?
R:  Uh, I went to school in Tulsa.
L:  And why would you change that?
R:  I'd want to go further away from the Midwest.
L:  Uh.
R:  I'd go to the -- I'd go to the -- one on the east or west coast.
L:  Is that where you're from originally?
R:  No, I've just been in the Midwest the majority of my life.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, I guess to broaden my horizons.
L:  I'm with you.  I'm not sure what I would change if I went back in time.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I'm pretty happy with my life.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  All this --
R:  Well, I'm not nit- -- I'm not nitpicking -- me or -- I guess I'm nitpicking myself, but -- so there wouldn't be an ex boyfriend or anything or something like that you wouldn't dump earlier or, you know --
L:  No.
R:  -- buy a car --
L:  No.
R:  -- that you missed out on?
L:  No, I'm pretty content with my life.
R:  Well, that's good.
L:  Yeah, I've -- I -- I don't know I kind of just feel like everything that's happened into my past, whether it was a mistake or not, like, I learned from it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It was kind of a valuable experience.
R:  Yeah, that's true.  I mean, if you could fix everything --
L:  But --
R:  -- we wouldn't learn anything.
L:  -- and -- and I also, like, I kind of, like, have done a lot of the things that I wanted to do, so ...
R:  Mm.  How old are you?
L:  I'm twenty seven.
R:  Okay.  I'm twenty --
L:  How old --
R:  -- eight.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, and I actually grew up on the east coast and moved out to the west coast --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and so I -- I was -- when you said that, I was, like, [LIPSMACK] I expect a different -- you know what I would have changed?  I would have possibly changed, um -- no, I wouldn't have changed that either, [LAUGH] like, I don't think I would have changed anything if I could go back in time.
R:  I -- I know one thing I'd majorly change, [LAUGH] I just thought of it.  I would've sold all my stocks off beginning of that September or -- I'm sorry, the beginning of, uh, the year two thousand --
L:  Oh, yeah, that would have been --
R:  -- 'cause --
L:  -- smart.
R:  -- when the market started tanking out --
L:  Yeah, that --
R:  -- I would have cashed out and gone to a mu- -- bond fund or something like that.
L:  Yeah, if I'd, uh, had any stocks I would -- that would be a great idea. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I did and got out of some of them so that was good.  But, you always want a hundred percent. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  So, what do you do in Kansas?
R:  Um, I work for a computer company and, uh, it's a fun little company to work for --
L:  Yeah.
R:  What do you -- what do you do out there?
L:  I'm a school social worker.
R:  Are you really?
L:  Yeah, so ...
R:  I work -- I work with schools, so --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah, we write software  for schools and it, uh, [LIPSMACK] uh, so I get -- actually I'm going out on site to visit a couple of schools tomorrow.
L:  Okay, cool.
R:  Uh, yeah, I get to work in office and out of office, so ...
L:  That's -- that's a great thing.
R:  Yeah.  So, you're in San Francisco and you're a social worker?
L:  Mhm. [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
R:  Is that hard to -- is that hard to, you know -- standard of living, 'cause I always heard it's so high out there.
L:  Um, it was when I first got here during the dotcom.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but -- but not any more.
R:  Hm.
L:  Um, I mean, y- you know it's not, like, cheap. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, I mean, I can survive, so ...
R:  Yeah.  That's like my impression always of California is you've got to be, uh, working for Microsoft or some major company to be able to afford to live out there.
L:  I mean, nowadays it's a lot easier, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- yeah, like, for a basic [NOISE] studio apartment a couple of years ago was, like, sixteen hundred --
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  -- so, which was way above my means. [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.
L:  But, things have [NOISE] really changed, [NOISE] so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, yeah.
R:  Hm.
L:  But -- so we're --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- supposed to talk about this topic, [LAUGH] like --
R:  I know, it feels like, uh, we're going to get into [NOISE] trouble --
L:  [NOISE] I know, this is, like, it's a -- it's a hard -- like, it's a hard -- it's 'cause -- you know, it's, like, how many things would you really change about ...?
R:  Well, okay, I -- if I had to go back in time that's -- that's hard to change something, I'd -- I'd want to go visit people, you know, or possibly go -- if we can go and time travel, can I go to the future?  But, do I really want to know what the future holds in time?
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yes, I could go in the past, like, there's a lot of, um -- like -- like, because I'm a social worker, there's a lot of --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- like, parts of, like, society [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, once you choo- --
L:  -- that I would have loved to be a part of like the movement or something, you know.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Like, changes that are like -- it was never the way it is now.
R:  Wouldn't you have liked to have been at that big rally or the big event, you know, and --
L:  Right --
R:  -- because --
L:  -- or even like just like with the school districts it's so corrupt and like just --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- being, like, here when things started going bad and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and like being like that -- and one administrative assistant or something that could have said something to somebody that would have changed it or --
R:  Well, really there's actually a lot of things you would change if you'd -- you know, littler things -- I guess, not about your life but other things --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, yeah.
L:  Yeah, there's a lot of things that I'd love to change in the past --
R:  It --
L:  -- but it's not specifically about my life --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's about, like, the bigger picture, I guess.
R:  Okay.  I understand your point, uh, definitely because I'm very content with my life and I love it, 'course I wish I was a millionaire too but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I'm very -- I'm very happy with it but as you never have mistakes, you know, and [MN] can never --
L:  Right.
R:  -- arrange anything[?], but learning and stuff -- they, uh --
L:  But I can understand the -- like, wanting to go back and change where you went to school.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I al- -- I always wish I could say, like, an ivy league school or Stanford or Florida State, you know, somewhere with a lot sun and the ocean and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know,  it -- it's because when you're younger it's so much easier to go do things and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I've traveled overseas when I had the chance and there's no way in heck I could do that now.
L:  Right.
R:  So --
L:  Where did you go overseas?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Uh, I went to New Guinea for a couple of months --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and then I went with some friends -- well, some friends to New Guinea and then I went with some friends to, uh -- to Europe to tour around.
L:  And how old were you --
R:  -- and --
L:  -- when you did that?
R:  Uh, twenty one and twenty two.
L:  Oh, yeah.  It's totally different.
R:  Uh, yeah, big time.
L:  So, yeah --
R:  Um, those are the kind of things that I can say I'm glad I did and, like, wouldn't have to go back and change.  But that --
L:  Right and I'm wondering if I wanted to add anything to my life.  Like go back --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, like, I don't know --
R:  I always think financially, I guess [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- the stock market 'cause have you ever seen that movie with, uh, Jean Claude, um, [LIPSMACK] Damme, um -- I don't know how to pronounce his name, he had, uh, time travel and people were going back to, like, the nineteen ten or nineteen twenty stock market crash and the next day they were putting all their money into certain stocks, but then they were just --
L:  Oh, I've heard of that movie, but I haven't seen it.
R:  That's what I -- that's where I -- I'm coming from basically --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it'd be really --
L:  No, I can totally understand that.
R:  It'd be dangerous, you know.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I'd rather just go without it and just live and let be what's going to happen.  Is it --
L:  Yeah, time travel's kind of scary.
R:  You can't trust people --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and you can't trust, like, human nature.  I -- I'm not sure if I could trust myself.
L:  Well, the thing is also weird, like if you go back, like, you would change, like, a whole series of events.
R:  Yeah, the whole back to the future movies.
L:  Yeah, exactly --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like the whole, like, with -- just like, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't own a television so I don't know what I'm talking about, but my mom says there's, like, this new TV series on that, like --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- where she, like, can -- she can see the future and make decisions --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- and, like, every time she makes a decision, like, it affects the outcomes and, like, one time she had -- like, she had to choose between -- like, her sister was dying or something and needed, like, a heart transplant and --
R:  Oh wow.
L:  -- so she chose to, like, go -- like -- like, she could see her sister dying if she didn't get this heart transplant, so she --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- she, like, um, did everything in her power to, like, make this -- her sister have, like, a donor or something and it turned out. like, her donor was, like -- she was only going to have a do- donor because her best friend died in, like, this car crash --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- so, like, the series of events that are ha- -- like, when she changed the series of events it had to be that her f- -- and she didn't know that that was what the series of events were going to be as changed before the -- her --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to get the heart.  The series of events would be that, like, her best friend would die in this car crash and, like, that was the heart that her sister would get or something.
R:  Oh, man.
L:  And I was, like, god, what, like -- you know and of course she didn't know what was going to happen for her to have the outcome that she wanted, but I was, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that totally puts it in perspective, like, how much things can change if [NOISE] -- if you change one th- -- you know, like, change one small thing and, like, [NOISE] it sets off --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a whole [NOISE] domino effect.
R:  Yeah, that's like you're playing god by doing that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Wow.
L:  So -- so, that's the thing is, like, I think about, like, if I went back and changed something, like, wh- -- how -- like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- who knows, like, I would end up like maybe in Kenya right now and, like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- five kids or something, you know, like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- who knows what would have happened.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So far --
R:  I don't know -- um, there's obviously more -- you sit and think about the more you could change and thinking, "Oh, I'd maybe change that" or, you know, like, [NOISE] I know one time I got in a car wreck I'd know I wouldn't have gone through that intersection for something like that, you know.
L:  Oh, yeah, like, little --
R:  Yeah, there's a --
L:  -- things.
R:  -- yeah, like visiting, you know, a relative right before they die or something like that.
L:  Right.
R:  The -- the more you think about it the more you can think, "Oh, I -- I'd definitely do that" or, "I'd do this or --"
L:  See, I -- it's just like, I mean, I've had loss in my life and so -- but I still -- I can't think of anything I would change, if I went back.
R:  Hm, no friends die in, like, a wreck or relatives you'd like to see once before they died?
L:  I mean, maybe it's because they died so long ago that I'm, like -- I think like I have closure but maybe I didn't at the time, I don't -- you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but now I'm, like, "No, we're good".
R:  Yeah.  Well, I haven't had any of that happen, I mean, I've had a grandparent die but, uh, they were --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- another --
