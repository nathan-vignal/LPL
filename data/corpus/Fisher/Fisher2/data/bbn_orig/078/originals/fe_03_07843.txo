L:  Oh, 'cause I worked for them too, so that's why I'm interested.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, because they're all through the whole internet, how they're the greatest business in the whole world but, uh, I don't know what you found but ...
R:  Well, I worked for them for a while but I didn't get the results that I -- that I was expecting, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  So you would like to have changed that, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  The way they do business.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  How would you change it?

R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Hypothetically speaking.
R:  Hypothetically speaking, yes. [LAUGH]
L:  How would you change it?
R:  W- I would change the compensation plan, the way they pay.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  Uh --
L:  So you feel, uh, every lead that you generate should be paid whether it's good or bad, it's a good lead and that's it?
R:  Right.  Right, 'cause --
L:  And then they'll -- they only pay -- if it's a bad lead they don't pay, if it's a good lead up to their standards they pay?
R:  Right.
L:  Remember that, I didn't care for that either.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And then at the end of the week your check wasn't much, right?  No. [LAUGH] 
R:  R- yeah, that's true. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So you would ch- -- what else would you change?  They now have it online where you can lo- -- you can, uh, type in data entry or -- would you -- would you wanna go through all that or it's not worth it?
R:  No, probably not.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So would you like to own that company? [LAUGH]
R:  What's that?
L:  Would you like to own that company?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And change it right? [NOISE]
R:  And change it, I would like to change it, yes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't blame you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And what are some other experiences?

R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  I'm --
L:  So hypothetically speaking, how would you change that situation?  Would you wait to have children or ...?
R:  Um, yes, if I -- if -- if I could, if I could change it, yes, I would avoid it.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So you feel you should've gotten more out of your -- more out of life before you actually settled with a child?
R:  Yes, yeah.
L:  Is that what you're thinking?
