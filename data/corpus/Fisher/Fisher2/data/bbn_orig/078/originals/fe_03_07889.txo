R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  My name's, uh, Greg McGarry from, uh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh, okay, I'm Crystal Walker, I'm from Olathe, Kansas.
R:  Oh, from Kansas.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Where Dorothy lives.
L:  Oh yeah, I haven't seen her, but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that's what they say.
R:  [LAUGH] Right, Wizard of Oz and all that stuff.  Hey, we are supposed to talk about if an a- -- non -- anonymous benefactor offers a million dollars would we, uh, take it if the one stipulation is we don't talk to our best friend ever again?
L:  That's a tough one, isn't it?
R:  I don't think so.  I'd take it in an eye wink.
L:  Oh, would you really?
R:  Oh, yeah.  I could write them, can't I?
L:  Well, that's true.
R:  Send them smoke signals, uh, I can dance and laugh just not the talk.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] They s- -- they're going to love me at -- yeah, they got to understand the situation as long as I don't talk, right?
L:  Well, yeah, I hadn't really given it much thought, but I guess --
R:  And how many -- how many --
L:  -- there would probably be ways around it.
R:  Yeah, sure.  If that's to loo- -- well, let's -- let's say there is no other way around it and you had to leave them and not be able to talk to them, I think that's what they really would like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to see whether it's a ethical dilemma, what kind of, uh, ethics do you have?  Well --
L:  Or, what kind of friends do you have?
R:  Yeah, what kind of friend do you have, how many best friends do you have?
L:  Actually, I only have, uh, one or two best friends --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I mean, no -- good friends are really hard to come by that's why it's such a --
R:  Uh, yeah.
L:  -- tough decision.
R:  Yeah, it's more important to women, I think, than men.  I mean, that's a sexist thing to say [NOISE] but, um, men tend to be mo- -- loners for more periods of time.  I think, uh, they found that women that are in prison if they don't have people to talk to they have big problems like solitary confinement and so forth.  So -- so conversations and, [LIPSMACK] um, friendship and that kind of stuff not that it's so important to men, just more important, I think, 'specially the verbal end of it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to women. [LIPSMACK] That's half --
L:  Well, of course, you know, you've got to consider there's, you know, other aspects, you know, you could figure you could always find another really good friend, I mean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and also --
R:  Or someone to int- -- or someone to interpret your life through your speaking.  You could say, "Tell my friend I loved him". [LAUGH]  And they'll be standing right there but you're not talking to them, you're talking to someone else. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I -- I can think of all sorts of loop holes but you know -- know it, uh -- there used to be a show way back [LIPSMACK] in the fifties called, uh, The Millionaire.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Uh, you're -- you're probably too young, um, I was just a kid, I mean, I'm fifty five now.  And so, [LIPSMACK] what it was was a, uh -- the -- the premise of the show was this -- this rich guy named Kipton[?], I think something Barry[?] Kipton, I forgot his middle name, didn't I -- had this guy, Mr Anthony, who would dress up in a nice, uh, navy blue suit and he would carry a briefcase and knock on your door and th- -- he would give you a million dollars and you -- the rest of the show was what happened to you and your family and so forth.
L:  Oh, how it corrupted you, in other words?
R:  [LAUGH] Well, yeah, I guess money can corrupt, can't it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] I mean, if, uh -- they say those who say, "Oh, I'd -- I'd love to hear --" -- there's a saying in India, I -- I -- uh -- uh -- uh -- they say, uh, you know, "Everybody wants to make a deal with God to give a million dollars".  You know, in other words, "If I've got all this money, God, you know I'd help everybody".  Well, what does he need you for to help people, you know, huh?
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, you know, those kind of deals are made, but I don't know what would happen if you got that kind of money and, uh, of course, [SIGH] I would, uh [SIGH] -- I've seen it ruin people -- money ruin people and I've seen, uh them stay the same.  So, I don't know what would happen to me.  I'd like to think that I'd be generous and kind and -- than I am now -- less self centered, but I wonder if the bad -- my worst qualities would come out?
L:  Yeah, I don't know, I think that's kind of -- I think if you tend to be a good person and a nice person to begin with --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I wouldn't really think that it'd alter you that much.  But, if you tend to be, you know, the other way --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it might bring that to the fore.
R:  Yeah.  That's what -- they say that too, but I know I have tendencies -- both tendencies in myself.  I don't know, I'm good bad with that, you know, I mean, um, kind, uh, considerate, uh, thinking about others and I'm self centered sometimes [LIPSMACK] and then, you know, I can -- I can be hedonistic.  So, I wonder if I would just relax and be happy go lucky and --
L:  Well, there's nothing wrong with that if you had a --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- a million dollars you could spend a certain amount of -- of that on that, I would think, but --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- you'd have to --
R:  -- well, I'm just -- I'm just -- I'm just speculating, I don't know what I would do.  [LIPSMACK] I like to think I would do, uh, noble things, but I don't know what I would do.
L:  No.
R:  I don't know what it would do to me. [LIPSMACK] The -- you know, I don't know -- I just don't know.  I --
L:  Of course a million isn't that much any more --
R:  No.
L:  -- I can't imagine it corrupting you too badly.
R:  No, no it's not that much, no.  My friend -- a million dollars isn't -- well in one lump sum it's not bad --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know.  It's a hundred thousand dollars a year for ten years and it used to be really fantastic.  Now, you have to have ten times that now to be considered a millionaire I would think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like, to be -- which you would consider a millionaire but ...  My friend owns eight apartment buildings and when he sells them he'll be well -- he's well off anyway, but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- he has a lot of free idle -- idle time to travel and all that kind of stuff -- just by managing --
L:  That's nice 
R:  -- an apartment.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, that's really what, I think, being rich is.  To have -- to be able to do and go where you -- where you want and to, en- -- uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- enjoy and to learn and hopefully give, you know [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Yeah
R:  -- some sort of human service I would think.  Uh, I am interested in that at some level so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, that gives me some sort of joy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.  Would you give your mon- --
L:  So, you --
R:  Would you give, uh --
L:  Par- --
R:  Would you -- what would you do with the money if it was given to you and you could do ...?
L:  Oh, I like to travel.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I'm a big travel buff.
R:  Where would you go?  Where would you --
L:  I always -- I --
R:  -- what would be the number one place? [NOISE]
L:  Well, uh, [SIGH] I'm into Europe, I like Europe.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'd probably start out in Europe and go from there.
R:  Would you go to a spec- specific country first -- that intrigues you ?
L:  Oh, probably the UK.
R:  UK, mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You have -- you have that, uh, background or  Irish, English?
L:  Uh, well, I'm -- [inaudible] English  --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so I'd probably start out at the UK --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, you know, I'd like to see Scandinavia.
R:  Yeah, I'd like to see Norway myself, you know, I've friends in Norway.
L:  It's supposed to be beautiful.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'd like to see Iceland too.
R:  Oh, Iceland, Reykjavik, yeah.  Highly literate coun- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- highly literate country, the kids have an alcohol problem but I m- -- where isn't there a problem?  And they've done s- -- gene s- -- genome studies there because the people are pretty -- haven't been --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- blended much, you know.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] That's, um -- and my --
L:  They're supposed to be very unique.
R:  -- and my friend -- uh, my -- my -- er -- uh -- uh -- wife's, um, brother's wi- -- they never left Pennsylvania --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but they went there, [LAUGH] they went to Iceland. [SIGH] Uh, they liked --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the, you know -- it was their first foray out the coun- -- out of the state and the country, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They --
L:  What did they think of it?
R:  They loved it, it was fantastic, you know, uh, then they went to Lithuania.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH] I loved it --
L:  Interesting.
R:  -- I loved it, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Not -- not a typical route but, you know [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Avoid all the tourists.
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But, of course, they were Lithuanian -- part Lithuanian, so that's really why they did it.
L:  Oh, well that makes a difference, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Kind of get to your roots and sort of get an idea of your background.
R:  Yeah.  It's the one -- it's the one Baltic language that's Sanskrit based, you know.
L:  [NOISE] Is it really?
R:  But -- yeah, Russian has a lot of that in it too, but, you know, the [NOISE] words are similar, but Lithuanian is -- hasn't been, uh, doctored too much through time --
L:  Oh, that's interesting.
R:  -- it's -- well, the Aryans came, you know, from that area and that's why they -- but the Russians use them for basketball players. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, do they really?
R:  They're very, very good looking people, tall blond, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- yeah.  I mean, the standard we have today.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and so where else would you go, would you go to the Far East, would you -- does that intrigue you?  Brazil? 
L:  Uh, I'm not too interested in South America at the moment --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I kind of thought it might be interesting to go to New Zealand too.
R:  Mhm mm.
L:  It's supposed to be so gorgeous over there and great hiking country.
R:  Nat- natural wonders, you know, and the orienteering -- do you use those orienteer- -- -teering poles when you walk -- hiking? [LAUGH] I've seen someone do that, I -- I wat- -- takes the weight off your knees they say, you can walk twice as far.
L:  Wh- what is it?
R:  [NOISE] Orienteering poles, it's like ski poles that they use now?
L:  Oh, right, yeah, I've seen them.
R:  And it really helps, uh, and really takes -- yo- you know, just by moving them, it takes a lot of weight off your knees.
L:  I didn't know that, I've seen people out walking with them and I wondered --
R:  Uh.
L:  -- what they were doing.
R:  Yeah, it -- it -- and you think, "What do they need balance for?"  Well, it takes -- it also takes the weight off your joints, so that's if you wear a -- a big backpack it really helps.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, uh -- yeah, I would, uh [SIGH] -- talking to my best friend -- I mean, I have [SIGH] a couple of friends, um, that I talk to on the telephone -- I do like to talk to them, I'm one of those rare males that enjoys conversations more than anything --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, uh, sharing, you know, ideas and, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I'm an artist and a musician so I -- I -- I communicate that way.
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a jazz musician --
L:  Oh, what -- what kind of artist and mu- --
R:  I'm a -- well I paint and I -- I -- I play professional piano.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, uh, I've been -- all my life I've been all over, you know, be s- -- [inaudible]. Boston --
L:  Are you like a classic piano player or -- or a jazz --
R:  Uh, yeah, I started that way but I'm jazz, you know, I do jazz stuff and --
L:  Oh, right, okay.
R:  So, I started then -- I sing -- I sing old stuff [LIPSMACK], you know --
L:  Huh, well that's very big in Kansas City, you know, jazz and blues --
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] --
L:  Actually --
R:  Charlie "Bird" Parker, didn't he come from there, right, uh?
L:  Yes, he did, he sure did.
R:  [LAUGH] Each --
L:  And there are some other ones, I can't think of them right off the bat --
R:  Well, he changes -- he changed everything and, uh -- I mean, of course Louis Armstrong started it but he -- the "Bird" --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- did the, uh -- made this -- made everything work -- between him and Dizzy Gillespie and those guys.
L:  Did you see the special by Ken Burns on, uh, PBS about jazz, he does a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- special --
R:  It was fantastic.  I -- I would, uh, of course probably use the money, if I had it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't know, I would, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- probably pursue my art more, I -- I would like to think I wouldn't waste it but I'd probably waste some.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [MN] And, um, I have a small -- little concern in sub -- Central America, a little, uh, orphans home --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- that doe- doesn't -- they don't know I'm helping, you know, I've -- there's a -- a cleric there that takes care of them, you know, and feeds and clothes them and all that and it doesn't take much --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to support them and so I get down and visit him and I'm just a guy visiting him, they don't know that I'm the -- I'm the cat that's giving them the --
L:  Oh, right.
R:  -- because I don't want -- I want them to feel like these kids are coming up by themselves, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I want them to feel like, uh, there's no American helping them, they did it on their own --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so when they go to school and college and so forth --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the joy will be -- the joy is to see them --
