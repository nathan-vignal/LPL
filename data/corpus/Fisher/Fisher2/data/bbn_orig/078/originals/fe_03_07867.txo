L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi. [NOISE]
L:  My name's Maureen.
R:  Hi, Maureen, my name is Randall.
L:  Hi, Randall, nice to meet you.
R:  And you as well.  I understand we're supposed to talk about time travel today?
L:  Actually, the question they just gave -- did they give you that question?
R:  They gave me that topic, yes.
L:  Huh, it gave me a different topic.
R:  Uh, well I guess they're trying to, uh, do some strange thing of seeing what the hell would happen.
L:  [LAUGH] If they give us a different topic then what will we talk about.
R:  Exactly, yes.
L:  Uh-huh, that's okay.  Well, my -- just to tell you, my to- -- my prompt was, um, if you could open your own business and money --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- was not an issue, what kind of business would it be, how would you do it?  Do you think you'd be a success -- successful business owner?
R:  I see. [NOISE]
L:  That was mine, I did the time travel one in another conversation actual -- actually --
R:  Uh, well --
L:  -- the one where you could go back in time and change anything.
R:  Um, yes. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  Which -- which is strangely, uh, what I -- I guess I would say, strange, uh, as compared to that because it seems more or less the same as far as, uh, what would you do or what would you have done.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, anyhow ...  So, well --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- all I can say is, uh, which topic interests you of those two?
L:  Um, you know, we could discuss both if we wanted --
R:  All right.
L:  -- but I -- I -- I -- I would say the business one I'd go for first --
R:  All right.
L:  -- 'cause I already did the [LAUGH] time travel one. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, and, uh, I'm quite familiar with both of those being that, uh, I actually owned two businesses at one point.
L:  Oh, okay.  What -- what --
R:  So --
L:  -- were they?
R:  Graphic design and publishing --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- in Los Angeles.  I -- I presently reside in Brooklyn.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, and --
L:  So, you don't own any business any more?
R:  No, in fact what I've gone on to do is to, uh, shut down both those businesses a year ago and have a very simple life of merely writing books and travelling.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Which I greatly enjoy, so --
L:  I can imagine, I'd enjoy that as well.
R:  Well, I --
L:  That's great.
R:  Uh, well thank you.  I -- I did relatively well with those two businesses, enough to where I could just basically just say [MN].  I've had it with running businesses and on top of that I had no formal training whatsoever, I had no idea what I was doing when I started doing it --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [NOISE] and, um, I merely did it and, uh, [SIGH] and there you go.
L:  So, you just made it up as you went and figured out how to --
R:  [LAUGH] Yes.  That was exactly it and I started out as a teenager with a publishing business.
L:  Wow.
R:  And, um --
L:  What did you publish?
R:  It was on a small -- it started out as a small music fanzine and turned into a relatively large, literary satire magazine.
L:  May I ask what it is?
R:  Yes, the title of it was Angry Thoreau -- as in Henry David.
L:  Oh, okay.  I haven't heard of it --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- but ... [LAUGH]
R:  It, uh -- well part of, um -- part of it w- -- uh, initially it was, um -- it started out on the newsstand --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and then for a little while it went, um -- I put it out for free -- when, um -- when I had, um -- I guess the term is "upgraded" and then, um, uh, as far as the format I went on to, uh, newsprint and so forth, and that was in the late eighties, early nineties.  At that time there were a lot of, uh, fanzines that were going rather large --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I don't know if you're familiar with, um, uh, Flipside, Maximum Rock and Roll, Benistead[?], Answer Me --
L:  Maximum Rock and Roll I'm probably most familiar with.
R:  Yeah, I, um, Tim Yohannon, who was the editor, and I used to be quite the, uh, +ardent, uh -- or should say, ardent, uh, enemies because he was such a, um --
L:  Uh. [LAUGH]
R:  -- he was an absolute Marx- Marxist and, um --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- uh -- anyhow he was, uh -- he was dead set on his little punk scene in San Francisco and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, [LAUGH] uh, I u- -- I actually used to write poems for them --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and I was friends with Larry Livermore and, um, Nichol[?] Board[?] who lives here in New York.  Um, Larry Livermore, after he got big with, um, [LIPSMACK] Green Day back in the early nineties --
L:  Right, okay.
R:  -- uh, he sold the record company and then moved to London and then just disappeared altogether.
L:  Huh.
R:  So -- but, um -- yeah, a lot of those rags -- I used to write for them and -- and now all of them, as far as I'm concerned, are more or less gone.  Either, the -- the editors are dead or the magazines have just -- in the late nineties everybody just got sick and burned out --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, everybody started out as teenagers --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so Al[?] at Flipside, Darby[?] at Benistead, um -- there's -- you know, there's the occasional editor of -- such as Aaron[?] who does Comment[?] Bus[?], uh, I don't know if you're familiar with him?
L:  I don't think so.
R:  Um, uh, who is still, um [LIPSMACK] -- still doing his rag, uh, actually having books put out by, uh, publishers there, uh, la- -- it's either Last Gasp or AK Press, I forget whom.  But, um, getting back to the topic on point, I just, um -- I just decided I'd had it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and so I stopped it and just decided I was going to write the books that -- that I had been meaning to complete over the last few years and so I completely changed my venue.  I dropped everything, I left everything in Los Angeles, moved to New York [LIPSMACK] and, uh, I just go walking around Manhattan all day for the most part and, uh --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] -- taking notes, having a beer or a scotch there and, um, sending notes back to an editor , so it's quite nice --
L:  That --
R:  -- um --
L:  -- sounds really nice.
R:  But as far as opening a business, I would absolutely recommend it.  It's damn hard but at the same time as I, um, uh, witness [MN] one doesn't need any formal training.
L:  Sure.
R:  Uh, it's just a matter of passion and realizing the dynamic that's going to be incurred, in other words, failure, for the most part --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and just damn well do it, for Christ's sake.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I -- you know, it's a funny question 'cause I've -- I've never thought that would be something I would be predic- -- pre- [MN] particularly good at.  Um, it's kind of a fantasy question for me.  It's like, -- if -- if I suddenly felt like I had the ambition to do it -- I mean, I don't think it's a bad idea, it's just not something I see that I particularly want to do and I don't -- I don't know if I'd be particularly good at it either, you know.  But, if I did have those things then, uh, the sky's the limit as far as what I would do though.  I think I would want to do something fun and creative like -- I don't know, design -- come up with the latest, you know, uh, fashion trend or something --
R:  Well --
L:  -- in little purses or -- or, I don't know -- something -- something creative, even if it's not, you know, main stream like that.
R:  You would certainly want to do something that, um, for the hours that are incurred -- uh -- that are required for owning a business or starting it up, especially with, um, um -- if I may, um, state so, without any capital or any support, uh --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- without, uh, you certainly have to have passion for it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because that's the only thing that's going to give you -- that's going to be your engine through thick and thin.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, and just knowing that you have something that's just a matter of time of putting it out there by any means available.
L:  Right, and at this point, you know, I have my -- my passions but nothing -- the passions don't lie along the lines of wanting to necessarily make a business out of it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, if I -- I'm sure you're right, that's the only way to -- you got to have that drive to want to make a business out of it --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and the passion for making a business or else it's --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- not going to work. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, and it's -- I mean, just knowing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that that's going to do it.  We- -- if I may ask, what is it that you do at present?
L:  Uh, [LAUGH] actually I just moved to Maine and I'm job hunting.  I'm -- I'm pretty young and --
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  -- I'm still -- I'm just a couple of years out of college and --
R:  Uh.
L:  -- still trying to figure out, you know, what to do with the big old life, so at this point --
R:  I see.
L:  -- I'm just looking for a [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a subsistence type job.  I lived --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in Chicago for a couple of years and worked at a nonprofit doing administrative assistant work.  So, it's probably the kind of thing I'll end up with again in --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, I like working in the social service sector so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't do anything real fancy as far as my job right now [LAUGH].  I don't and I -- I'm trying -- I -- I'm, uh -- do photography -- did photography in college and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'm trying to get back into that now, so ...
R:  That will -- see right there, that is how and I have to add, I'm sorry because I -- I -- I listen to everything that someone says, having that journalistic, uh, blood in me --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'm not that old, I'm only thirty three years old --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, so --
L:  You've done a lot. [LAUGH]
R:  I have, uh, well it's just -- it's -- it's -- it's just been put in there, I've been travelling since I were ten days old when I was flown from Arkansas to California and then around the rest of the world until --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- hell, I don't know when, but, um, I -- the photography was one thing that I took up while I was doing, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- magazine publishing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because I did everything myself --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  -- I preferred to do the writing, the editing, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the photography, the layout, the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- typography, the printing, all of that.  And photography is something that I still pursue even at this day.  I have a colleague that I'm going to go --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- out with in, um, a few hours, to Manhattan to take some shots because he bought a new camera.  So, we're going to go out and test it by taking shots of each other throughout, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- from lower East Side all the way up to Bronx or, um, um, on -- I don't -- maybe --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Harlem, it depends on how we feel.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, it has to do not so much, I would suggest, as, um -- and I learned this from my early mistakes -- of having a talent, as selling it.  Making people understand that, making people understand that you have something to offer and on top of that, having something that you can translate to something that -- that will enrich some other people's lives.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  So -- because I initially thought that by merely producing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- something that I thought worthy was all it took, and it didn't.  Once I understood that I had to put it out there by any means poss-
