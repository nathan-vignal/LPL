L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  My name is Marissa.
R:  Hi, Martha.  I'm [MN] Alan.  
L:  Alan, hi.  Would you commit perjury?
R:  [LAUGH]  Uh, no I don't think I would.
L:  Now what e- what exactly is perjury?  What's a good definition of it?
R:  Perjury would be, uh, lying under oath.  
L:  Lying under oath.
R:  Yeah, like in a court of law or something like that.  You -- it potentially you -- I guess I could -- would possibly do that if it was a -- a family member, you know, a spouse or -- or a -- a child or something like that.  But, uh, [LAUGH] I don't think you're allo- -- [MN] you wouldn't even have to be ab- -- you wouldn't have to testify in a court of law, uh, with, uh, against a spouse or -- or child, I don't think.
L:  Oh, really?  Yeah, I think you're right.  I don't know that I would -- that I would do that either.  You know, I -- I love my -- my husband and my son but, um, if I wouldn't have to talk for them, you know, family members that rule you just said, then anyone else, you know, forget [LAUGH] it.  I think I would rather tell the truth and not live with it on my conscience the rest of my life.  
R:  Well, that true.  And also if it could be proven that you committed perjury you would be in trouble too, so ...
L:  Yeah, that's right.  I wouldn't want to get myself in trouble.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Unless like the mafia was after me or [LAUGH] something.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, um, let's see.  Let's talk different situations.  Um, what if your best friend lied for you and is, like, taking the heat for a crime that you did?  Then what would [LAUGH] you do?
R:  [LAUGH]  Well, I would deserve whatever I got.  Probably if he was taking the heat for what I -- for a crime that I did I -- uh, it probably wouldn't -- it wouldn't -- probably wouldn't bother me at all to perjure myself.  
L:  Yeah.  Hm.  You're right.  Uh, what else are we supposed to talk [LAUGH] about?  This is my first one doing this.  
R:  Mine too, so ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, okay.  Um, perjury.  Uh, what do you think about other people committing [LAUGH] perjury?
R:  Well, [MN]  I -- I would think that people [MN] if -- if you -- you committed perjury in a court or something like that they would -- [MN] that's the basis for a whole -- a whole court of -- of laws and -- and rules and regulations.  If it was a -- if you committed perjury, uh, then h- how could you trust the -- the court to -- to make proper judgement or fair judgement?
L:  Hm.  Um, I don't know that -- I don't have any experience with anything perjury.  Um, I've never been on a jury or anything like that and I've never been in court so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I don't have any personal experiences.  Um, do you have any experiences?
R:  No, I haven't.  Uh, I've never -- I've never been, uh, been on a jury or, uh, actually been in a court case or anything like that.
L:  Mm.  I see movies though with people [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]: 
L:  -- lying on the stand.  That counts.
R:  Right, well, and of course that's what makes the move.  That's what makes it -- the movie, you know, something like that.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Uh.  [MN]  I [MN] -- yeah.
L:  I think that if, um, if one of my friends or family member like lied for me if I was in [LAUGH] trouble, I don't think that I would be very -- very happy with that.  Um, you know, because I'd want to kind a take the heat for my own actions and not have somebody else try to cover up for me.  
R:  If a -- a close friend asked you to lie on the stand [MN] and -- and let's say a crime was committed or something and -- and you knew that that person was at the scene of the crime and -- and tried to say [MN] why -- why don't you say I was over at your house for the evening.  What would you do?
L:  Um, I think that [MN] -- I think that if they asked me to lie then I would go through the thought process and say, you know what, you're not a very good friend if they want me to lie for [LAUGH] them.  
R:  Right.
L:  You know what I mean?  That's not the kind of friend I want so, I mean, I'd go and tell the truth and they're gonna have to suffer the consequences for their own actions.
R:  Right.
L:  I think -- I think in general, um, I like to be an honest person or I like to try to and something like perjury is -- is really serious -- serious business, especially 'cause I'm always, you know, I think I would get caught with that.  [LAUGH]  I'm not a very good [LAUGH] liar.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, my husband said President Clinton is good at [LAUGH] perjury.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'd agree with that.
R:  I don't know if we're supposed to get political or not on these calls.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]  Hey, I have -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I have no idea.  This is my first [LAUGH] one, again.  [COUGH]  [LIPSMACK]  Um, what else can we talk about?  [MN]  Um ...
R:  Uh, what is it -- they said that they would come back on line?
L:  Yeah, I think it's supposed to tell us when it -- ten minutes is passed.  I don't know.  We probably have, like, three minutes [LAUGH] down or something.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, what if it was something like really, really tiny that you [MN] -- you know, like, um ...
R:  If it wa- -- if it wasn't based on a -- uh, in a court of law or something like that?  Just basically a white lie or something like that?
L:  Like if you were in court and you had to tell -- like you were a witness for something and, you know, they wanted to know, like, what you were doing when the crime happened and, you know, you were doing something embarrassing or [LAUGH] something.  You know what I mean?
R:  Sure.
L:  I mean, [MN] would you -- would you say, oh, I was just -- I was just looking out my windows or, oh, I was picking my [LAUGH] nose or ...
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know what I mean?  I don't -- I don't know.  Something really tiny, like minute detail.  What about then?
R:  Well, you know, I -- I guess if it -- if it did not pertain to the case that they were trying then I guess maybe that it, y- you know, you could always come back and say I didn't remember what I did, what I was doing.  Um, but, uh, um, I don't know.  I -- I -- I'm assuming any type of lie under a co- -- or in a -- in a court would be considered perjury.  Uh, uh, you know.  But where -- where does perjury start?  Where does, uh, memory or interpretation end?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or what about --
R:  You know.  If -- if you -- if something happened two months ago and, you know, you can't swear up and down that you were doing this thing right at the exact same time that they're asking about, you know, everybody- -- anybody can make a mistake as far as memory or anything.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  You know.  That -- that -- the -- whatever they were asking about may have happened but exact time, exact location may not always be, um, easy to remember.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I -- I'm not sure that would be considered perjury.  
L:  Yeah.  Sometimes --
R:  Unless -- perjury would be willfully lying under oath and -- and m- memory loss or -- or lack of memory or, uh, exact facts in the case.  Remembering exact facts in the case would not be willfully lying.  
L:  Right.  And I -- I agree with -- people -- with what you said about, um, interpretation too.  People might interpret a situation and the way they interpret it might not be the truth but they think it is, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  So that wouldn't be perjury.  
R:  And I guess you'd probably get some people that say, well, it happens all the time.  I should better look out -- out for my own self.  You know, I'll just answer it the best way I can and -- and -- I -- I guess there's the also lying between, um, telling everything you know and telling exactly what's asked of you.  Because a lot of times, you know, you could go further along and so if -- if you were in a court of law and -- and you were being, uh, questioned in a court of law, you only answer exactly what's being asked.  Don't volunteer any extra questions.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That -- that, of course, wouldn't be perjury.  It would be up to the opposing counsel to ask the right questions in order to pull out the truth.  
L:  Yeah, that's what -- that's what I was gonna ask.  What if you, um, what if they ask a certain question and you like leave stuff out on purpose?  What is -- I mean ...?
R:  Right.  I -- I guess that -- you know, if -- if they're specifically asking for that information then I guess -- and you -- and you willingly left it out that would be considered perjury but if, uh, if it's not asked for or you're not telling the whole truth, I guess, [LAUGH] ...
L:  Hm.
R:  Or the total truth, only part of it.
L:  Man, it's a lot of different -- different situations that [LAUGH] you could get yourself into.
R:  Right.  There are different ways you can shade the truth.
L:  [MN]  Grey area.  That's right.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Hm.  Uh, I don't know an- -- trying to think if I can remember anything that ever happened to me that had to do with [LAUGH] perjury.  I don't think so.  
R:  It'd be interesting.  I can't imagine that you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- too many people calling, um, and talking on the phone about a -- a case where they actually perjured themselves.  Obviously they're not going to admit it , I don't think.  Even in a phone [LAUGH] call. 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, you're right.  They probably bury that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I wonder what the, um -- what are the consequences if you commit perjury?  I guess it depends on the size of the case.  I mean do you get like a slap on the wrist or what?
R:  Yeah, probably a lot of it would depend on, uh, the -- the result.  If -- if your testimony it -- it was perjured under oath.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, you know, caused a person to be convicted or be set free then it can be -- I would imagine that the situation would be pretty -- depending on what the person did, I would imagine that [MN] -- that could be, uh, pretty major.  Uh, if it had no bearing in, uh, what the, uh, jury or the judge thought in -- in determining the guilt or the innocence of a person I'm not sure that it would be that -- as big a deal.  A lot of it would probably depend on how much the prosecuting attorney or [MN] the other way the defence attorney would want to, uh, follow through on it.  
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, somebody like, um, O.J. Si- O.J. Simpson.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Him committing perjury they -- they would just kind a look the other way, [LAUGH] probably.
R:  Right.  
L:  But, um, yeah.  There's a lot of things wrong about our court system but there's a lot of things right too, you know.
R:  Right.  I -- I'm trying to think if a person who is -- course a -- a person under oath, uh
