R:  Good afternoon.
L:  [NOISE] Good afternoon.
R:  Oh, I thought I was speaking with a male participant.
L:  No, I think they're short on those. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Then maybe that's why I had to wait so long.  Uh, yes --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we know what the topic is, my name is Lenny, and your --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- name is?
L:  Theresa. [NOISE]
R:  Okay, Theresa, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- as far as the topic of the day is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- concerned, uh, unknown benefactors, [SIGH] and would you take a million dollars, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if you do not speak with your best friend, I believe that's it, is that right?
L:  Yes, that is, uh, is it. [NOISE]
R:  Okay, would you want to begin or would you want me to begin?
L:  You can begin. [NOISE]
R:  Okay, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- have they -- having thought over this topic for just about a minute or two, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] I think I would take the million dollars. [NOISE] Given best friends, [NOISE] if you don't include family, uh, I really do not -- I have friends but I would say they're not best friends, they're close friends.  But, uh, if you want to consider the topic best friend, um, I really don't have a best friend I just have close friends.
L:  [NOISE] All right. [LIPSMACK] Um, [NOISE] are you done?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay, well I'm going to agree with you and my -- my reasons are pretty similar too.  Yes, I would take the, uh, money --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, since they say best friends -- now, if they -- if -- if it was a family member, um, [LIPSMACK] I think I would hesitate --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- especially if it was, um, a daughter or, uh, maybe even an aunt or an uncle --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but because they say best friends and I don't really have any close best friends.  I have all kinds of acquaintances --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I have people I consider friends and, um -- but, I'm more or less a loner.  And, uh, I have so many hobbies and interests that I kind of shy away from people, just to have time for myself to get these things done I'm really interested in -- because too many times, um, friends, uh -- they're not interested in the same things and they just like to -- kind of -- call and idly chat with you and gossip and waste your time.  And, um, [NOISE] the person that I do consider is my best friend is my ex, uh, sister in law and she does not live close by.  She lives, um, in Kentucky, she runs a bed and breakfast and, uh, I rarely speak to her and whenever we do get, uh -- correspond, I usually initiate it.  But, uh, she pr- -- surprises me sometimes and comes through with a -- [LIPSMACK] an email or a letter and, um, I really cherish those things and her too.  But, since, uh, there's so much distance between us and, um, uh, so many varied interests, I'd have to go along with, "Yes, I'd rather have the money". [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  I think -- are you -- are you finished?
L:  Yeah, go ahead.
R:  Okay, uh, basically I guess we're in similar -- in a similar boat, maybe perhaps the same boat, uh, in terms of, uh, what do they consider a best friend?  If it was best friends, close friends and frie- -- uh, best friend, is that part of, uh family?  So, I guess the topic leaves a big question mark as far as, um, when you mention best friend, that's all I'm saying.
L:  Yeah.  Well, once -- we've got to talk for ten minutes -- once, uh, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I had heard it said that you don't make best friends late in life.  That you usually make them probably in your school years because you have so much in common then and, uh, when you get older you kind of drift apart and your interests and their interests don't remain the same and, um, it's just harder, there's just --
R:  Yeah, that is true.
L:  -- too many demands on you.
R:  I -- in fact, I -- I had a close friend, um, and, uh, he kind of, like, drifted apart from me, uh, because, uh, he didn't contact me for a while and -- and whenever I tried calling him he would never pick up the phone, since he lives by himself.  And this was even late at night and I didn't know his work number and subsequently one night he did pick up the phone and I was, like, talking with him and -- and chatting and -- and then was saying, "Why didn't you call?" and he really didn't have an answer.  I guess he was still mad at me for something I did to him way back when, and as a result, um, I said, "Let's get together", which we did and then after we got together I said, "Well, what about the next time?  You want to get together for, you know, drinks or some dinner?"  And, uh, after that he, uh -- he kind of, like, said," Uh, uh, uh" -- he really didn't commit himself to anything that day and I guess he didn't want to box himself in.  He had other interests and, uh, work commitments such as that and as a result, uh, you know, it is, like, drifting apart again. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that's a shame.
R:  Yeah, but, uh, I -- I -- it kind of surprised me more -- more than not, as far as him maintaining that sta- -- same steadfast, uh, stance as opposed to saying, "Oh, if I did something why don't we forget it and let's try to renew our friendship".  And I guess he didn't want to do that and, uh, as a result, you know, it's, like, back to where we started. [NOISE]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So --
L:  Where --
R:  -- that's, uh [SIGH] --
L:  Oh --
R:  --that's my -- my, uh -- my end of it as far as, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a friend.  Uh, obvi- --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- obviously there's other, like you said, acquaintances here and there but, uh, they come up I guess from the -- during the holidays more often than not and, uh, like, other times than that it's, uh -- it's the same thing, just go about your regular day and, uh -- and take [NOISE] it one day at a time. [NOISE]
L:  That's the way to do it.  When I do speak with, um -- with this, um -- well she's my ex sister in law, who I consider, uh, my best friend, um, we do have plenty to talk about, course I was married to her brother --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for eight years and mostly I'm interested in, uh, what the family's doings, if they're well or how they're doing in business, uh, if they've relocated.  Just, uh -- I keep asking questions about the family and she's into all kinds of other, uh, interests and, uh, she'll relate some of her experiences, uh, running the bed and breakfast.  And, um, her, um -- my mother -- ex mother in law -- her mother lives with her and, uh, that's always one of my concerns.  Uh, she's up in her nineties, I think around ninety two, and how her health is.  But, um, even though we don't, uh, converse often, um, there's still that bond there between us and, um when we do there is never a lack of anything to talk about --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- there's always -- and I know how delighted I am when I get letters from, um, old friends, usually at Christmas time with the --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the Christmas card.
R:  Right.
L:  They'll put a note in and how great it is to hear just, uh, what they've been doing and, uh, their plans for the future and -- but [NOISE] still there's no one that -- you know, when you're offered that amount of money --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's going to have to be something that's really, uh, uh -- something that you really cherish [LAUGH] before you're going to give it up.
R:  You're also, uh, given the scenario -- this hypothetic- -- hypothetical scenario for a million dollars -- is it, uh -- is it a million or is it a million before taxes? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, they -- the taxes will take an awful lot of that --
R:  You know about the lottos and the, uh, lottery games, uh, 'specially here in the north east?  Um, you can have a prize of about one seventy five, a hundred and seventy five million.  If you take it in a one lump sum, you get less than half.
L:  Oh, my gosh, that's an awful lot.
R:  Yeah, I -- I think the case was about seventy nine million that you -- or -- or something around that number, that they were willing to take home as a lump sum.  Sure that's a lot of money in itself but that tells you, uh, all the taxes and various other things, that the money, uh, goes to, uh, before you -- you get your hands on the lump sum.  I don't know how it is in, uh, down where you -- wh- where you are but, uh, up here we also -- from time to time we hear about these big, uh, um, payments, uh, that have been piling up -- not payments but the -- the numbers that have been piling up since nobody hit the, uh, numbers.  And as a result, uh, [LAUGH] somebody hits or just say a single person hits and, uh, again, one seventy five, you figure -- you take it in a lump sum, you'll maybe get forty, sixty percent of that and, uh -- or even half -- what's half of one seventy five?  Uh, about eighty seven --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- eighty seven so the guy got even less than -- al- although I don't know if it was a man or a woman but, uh, he even got less than, uh, half of that. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my gosh.  Uh, what would you, uh, actually -- is there anything that you would actually, uh, give up that one million dollars for, that --
R:  Well, if it concerned fa- --
L:  -- in your own life?
R:  -- if it concerned family, uh, I do have -- my father's still alive and, uh, I have my brothers, sisters and lots of nephews and nieces.  So, I guess, uh, if it was, um, one of them that you couldn't talk to or, uh, couldn't, uh, relate to, I think, in return for taking the million I don't -- I -- I would seriously have to think about that.  I -- I think that's what --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- you would tell me too.
L:  -- that's -- that's pretty, uh, hypothetical.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I would think probably my daughter or my son is --
