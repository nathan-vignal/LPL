R:  Hi, this is Deborah.
L:  Hi, my name's Angela.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  Um, well, what --
L:  You go first! [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  Okay!  Um, I mean, I've lived overseas before.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I came back -- I mean, I've actually kind of been in this situation, not a million dollars but like, I've been offered a really good paying job to stay overseas.
L:  Oh.
R:  In Italy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And live in Milan.  But I don't wanna live in Milan.  And a million dollars doesn't get you that far anymore.
L:  Yeah, this is true.
R:  I mean, like, a million dollars --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that's a few years --
L:  Yeah, if it was like a mega million --
R:  -- and then you better like where you're at. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH] I don't think a million dollars would be enough.
L:  I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I agree with you.  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I wouldn't leave this country for -- for any -- any amount of money, not even Canada.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, like you said, it's -- it's really not that much money w- when you break it down and, uh, my parents came from the old country and, uh, they -- they thank the good Lord every day that they were here.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, so it doesn't always seem, um, everything isn't always what it seems, so, yeah, that's -- that's how I feel about it.
R:  Where do you live now?
L:  Uh, I live in New York State.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Uh, but I've -- you know, I -- I came here when I was like, eighteen months old so I r- -- I really don't remember, I don't have first hand information about how it was over there.
R:  Right.
L:  But we do have relatives that come and visit us and of course when they come here we always have to give 'em money and -- and stuff --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- like that because they can't afford to live on what they make over there.  But if we give 'em American dollars, [MN] they're -- they're like millionaires over there.  But of course, it's for a little while too.
R:  Yeah.  It's true, I mean -- I don't know, I -- I really enjoyed [MN] -- and the thing is, is that -- I mean, I think it said in the -- in, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the little introduction that like, you could never come back.
L:  Oh, is that what they said?
R:  I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that just seems ridiculous because I don't think anybody would do that that didn't have significant others or family or something --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- that they would wanna visit.  Sure you could bring 'em over to you but f- with a million dollars it's not enough money to do it.
L:  [LAUGH] No kidding.
R:  Yeah.  I don't think this is even like -- this is even worth discussing because [LAUGH] I don't think anybody would take -- take that offer.
L:  Well, I mean, I -- I don't know, maybe, uh, some poor -- poor soul who's been looking for a job for- forever and --
R:  [MN] Or really adventurous types.
L:  Or adventurous, exactly, or -- or looking -- or looking for a -- a partner or something --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- not -- not having much luck here because that's got a lot, you know, to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But other than that I -- I can't -- I couldn't think of a -- a -- a situation where somebody would wanna do that.
R:  If I -- I mean, if they would bump up the sum.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] I could think of a couple of places where I wouldn't mind living.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh yeah, like --
R:  Like if I was to live in Italy I would definitely live in Florence.
L:  Yeah, really?  Is there like, um, a difference in, um, [LIPSMACK] or say, uh, Rome and Florence?
R:  Oh yeah, Rome --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't like.
L:  Okay.
R:  Rome is much more touristy and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- inconvenient and I found -- I mean you just -- it's got more of like a ... it's more of an urban feel but without the real convenience of urban society.
L:  Yeah.  Now, d- --
R:  Whereas Florence is just, I don't know, it's just in a -- it's kind of a marvel -- miracle of itself! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Now did this survey say j- to Europe?  Did they -- did they say --
R:  They didn't specify.
L:  Okay.
R:  I just think they said out of the US.
L:  All right.  Now, would you go to like, um, like, uh, uh, like the Bahamas or, uh --
R:  Well I don't like hot weather.
L:  Oh, it's -- I don't either. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't either.
R:  I mean, I would go to Canada, I don't see -- I'm really pin- politically ignorant.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And so to me it's definitely more like a climate and cultural thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, uh, I love how I just say that so blatantly, like I'm a --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- a complete, uh, political ignoramus, but I don't even care, like, it's just not my, um ... realm of interest.
L:  You see, we live --
R:  S- --
L:  -- right on the border of, um, Canada.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  [inaudible] is right -- right, uh, near Canada.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So we -- we visit there but I don't know, there's just something about Canada --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that, um, the good old USA is tops, that's all.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] That's all there is to it.
R:  No, I mean that goes without -- that definitely goes without saying.  I mean, and I have --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- European friends that say the same thing.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  I have friends that have moved from Italy and they live here now and they're like, they wouldn't go back either.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, visitation purposes only.
L:  Well that's about it I -- it's -- there -- there's a lotta places where you would like to visit but of course you know that you're coming home.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And 'cause you know the feeling like when you're going on vacation it -- it feels so great but when you're --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- coming home, that the miles seem even longer.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Because you wanna be home and you wanna be in your own little bed! [LAUGH]
R:  Plus I li- -- yeah, [LAUGH] totally!  I mean, I live in Manhattan so there's like, it's easy to get elements of other cultures without even leaving the city.
L:  Oh, right, right.
R:  Like, travel is almost --
L:  Right.
R:  -- unnecessary to get, you know, a feel of other people's -- of o- like, other worlds.
L:  Yeah, this is true.
R:  So that even serves more to my argument then it's not --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- worth it.  I mean, b- because also like, with a million dollars you'd have to take into consideration you're gonna have to be able to learn another society's l- language and --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- culture and get a job and like, completely integrate into their society if you -- honestly, if you could never come back.  Like, I'd --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- do it for -- a million dollars, I'd do it for a year.
L:  Well sure.
R:  For a million --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- dollars.
L:  Yeah.  But, um, I'm at the -- at th- the stage where I don't wanna learn anything [LAUGH] else.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I'm too set in my ways. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I like it just the way it is now because even, you know, after nine eleven happened, um, how everything in your life changed.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, and that was just like, one day.  And don't you want your life just to be back the way it was?
R:  Oh totally.
L:  You don't ha--
R:  I mean, I d- -- I see it every day --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- because I go in and out of buildings.
L:  Oh God, I can just --
R:  -- and they're like, "Can we check your bag?"
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  "Do you have ID?"
L:  Oh God.
R:  I'm like, "What?"  I'm like, "I'm going to the library and you're going to check my --"
L:  Oh, see --
R:  "-- ID and my bag to see, you know, w- for whatever?"
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  And like, it's not like I look like, um --
L:  You don't have a turban on your head.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I'm like -- I look like, you know, your typical girl next door American.
L:  Right.
R:  But it's, you know, it's indiscriminate, it's everybody --
L:  Well, yeah, I mean, they can't --
R:  -- everybody gets it.
L:  Exactly.  I mean, when you travel now, forget it.  I mean, you're -- it takes them for- forever to check you to go through it and -- and like, "Why are you checking me?  Do I look like I'm intimidating or something?"
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.  "I'm -- I don't have anything in my shoes or anything".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But -- but, um, I -- I guess they have to.  W- w- what are you gonna do, I don't w- think so.
R:  You know, I actually haven't found the travel thing -- I think I -- I -- I found the travel thing to be over hyped.
L:  Oh definitely.
R:  Like, the travel in --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just because it -- the -- people made it out to be so bad, it's like you're gonna be, you know, you have to get the airport three hours in advance --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and you're gonna wait in line --
L:  No.  No.
R:  -- and I'm like, I've breezed through security for -- and yeah and every once in a while I've had to take off my shoes but I consider that one of the lesser inconveniences --
L:  Oh sure.
R:  -- in the whole scenario.
L:  This is true.
R:  But, on the other hand, yeah, before it never was even an issue.
L:  Yeah, I know.  It -- it's too bad that -- but that's the way, you know, the world changes and unfortunately we -- of these incidents we -- we just -- we just have to go along with it.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I mean, it is certainly worth the -- the pros very much outweigh the cons.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, but I mean, but to the, uh, kinda back to the topic, at least --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that they gave us, it was -- it d- -- it wouldn't have changed -- like, had that not happened --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that wouldn't have -- it's n- -- there's never -- there -- I don't have like, a personal safety issue about leaving the United States.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
R:  And after September the -- whether pre or post September eleventh I still would feel the same way, it's like, I still don't wanna leave.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Exactly.
R:  But it has nothing to do --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with my feeling comfortable.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I mean, I've traveled to third world countries since nine eleven.
L:  Oh please.
R:  And yeah, weird things have happened to me --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but nothing that was any different than would've may have happened, you know, pr- --
L:  Yeah, I think so.
R:  -- post -- pre or post.
L:  I think -- I think I -- I agree with -- with what you're saying.
R:  It's, um, yeah, it's a different world today.
L:  Mhm.  So, I guess we're lucky we're -- we are in the good old USA.
R:  I know, I'm glad --
L:  [MN] [LAUGH]
R:  I'm gl- -- I -- I think we're --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I think I'm really glad that I can answer no to the question. [LAUGH]
L:  I know, 'cause sometimes you would [LAUGH] have a topic where -- where you'd say, "Should I this way or should I that way?"  But I think we both agree we're def- in definite agreement on this one.
R:  For sure.
L:  At least we don't have an argument!
R:  I know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It always ma- -- it's actually a little bit nicer when there is -- is -- somewhat more of an upheaval between [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  But this is kinda -- I mean, the same happened -- thing happened with my last [NOISE], um, topic.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It was something about comedy.
L:  Oh.
R:  Like, what's it -- what -- what comedy, uh, or what makes comedy inappropriate?  Or s- uh, something like that.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  I'm like, well, basically it depends on who you're telling the joke.
L:  Well that's it.
R:  I mean --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and then we were just sitting there.  We could've had dead silence for the rest of the time, it was like, yeah --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- okay --
L:  I know.
R:  -- that's true.
L:  I know.
R:  [MN] "So where do you live?"  You know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] This is actually just my second, uh, second topic, just second phone call.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, so, the one I had before was quite interesting too, I don't remember quite what it was but I talked to a very --
R:  Mine was something about relationships.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Which is always --
L:  Oh yeah, that's --
R:  -- good fodder for arguments.
L:  [LAUGH] For sure, for sure.  Um, other than that I -- I think we've, you know, pretty -- pretty much, um, covered [COUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] all the aspects of it.  But this is a very nice program.  I, uh, I like -- I like it.  I mean --
R:  I know.  I'm -- I think I -- I've -- the last person I spoke with definitely wa- -- I think at least was in it just to get the bucks.
