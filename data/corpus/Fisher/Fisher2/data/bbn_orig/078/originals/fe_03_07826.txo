R:  Danielle Florence.
L:  Uh, Helena Martinson.
R:  Yes?
L:  [LAUGH] This is the first time I've done one of these calls, so, uh --
R:  M- me too, so ...
L:  Uh, but, all we need to do is t- talk for ten minutes, so it sounds -- I guess it sounds like fun, so --
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, I guess the topic we need to talk on is a million dollars to leave the US and never return?
R:  Right.
L:  Um, it's a interesting topic.
R:  Mhm.  Uh, I would do it.  If -- if --
L:  Um, where would you go?
R:  Um, Costa Rica.
L:  Uh-huh.  It sounds like you, uh, have a Costa Rican accent, is that --
R:  No, I'm F- -- I'm French actually.
L:  French?  Oh.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Okay.  Uh, and why Costa Rica?
R:  Because I went there and --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- um, uh, the cost of living is --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- uh, fairly low compared to the US.
L:  Mhm.
R:  A very nice country, um, they have the -- the beach, they -- I don't know, I -- I really liked it there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'm assuming that I will get my pension from the US and that -- that they would send it over there though.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I -- I -- you know, I'm --
L:  So you'd have a million dollars and your pension too? [SIGH]
R:  Right.
L:  Mhm.  Uh, I don't know.  I guess it'd depend on, uh, variables.  Um, I mean, leaving the US and then not being able to return might mean not being able to see your family again and --
R:  Yeah, but they would come to visit though.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, and that would --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that would depend too, like, you know, would you be allowed to have visitors?  Um, you know.
R:  And you know, that's not too far from the US 'cause I would get a -- I heard some people go to Mexico to retire.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So --
L:  Uh, Mexico's beautiful.
R:  So you know, that's not too far, you know, that's like, a vacation for the family to come to visit you.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So ...
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] there'd be a lot of things about the US that I would miss though.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause there's, I know, in a way we're a very spoiled country.
R:  Right.
L:  And we have --
R:  What would you miss?
L:  We have so many things that other countries don't have and, you know, we have Walmart and ATMs and cellphones and -- and, uh, [NOISE] um, and there's not very many countries that have the standard of living that the US has.
R:  Right.
L:  So, uh --
R:  Yeah, but ATMs, they are nearly all over the place now.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And Walmart, maybe not, but --
L:  [LAUGH] Well, if you ma- got a million dollars you wouldn't need to shop at Walmart! [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, that's true.
L:  [LAUGH] You could shop at the designer stores.  Or on the internet and have everything shipped. [NOISE]
R:  That's right.
L:  So, uh --
R:  And then, uh, s- uh, cellphones, I guess I c- -- I don't have one, so I guess I could do without it.
L:  Uh-huh.  So, uh, um, I don't know, I guess if I could go to, uh, another country of my choice that would be easy for my family and friends to visit.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, uh, I would have a lot of the, uh, I guess the civil rights and things that I have in the US.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, I guess some of the things that are the best about the US, then, you know, I guess I would have to have that -- that assurance that I would be able to -- to have some of the good things that I like about the US with me --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- before I went, because if I would not be able to have the visitors or if I'd have to live in some -- even if I had a million dollars, living in some [SIGH] substandard country or a country where I'd have to see a lot of poverty and a lot of, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, I don't know, like, it'd be hard for me to -- to live in the Middle East and see, um, the w- -- difference in rights that women have from men --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- and how they have to wear those burqas and --
R:  That's right.
L:  Um, [MN] --
R:  That's why I wouldn't go there.
L:  [LAUGH] No, no, definitely have to be something that you would pick, so, um --
R:  But like, Costa Rica for example, they don't have an army, the president lives in a -- in a beautiful villa but that's not like a -- like the Whitehouse or anything --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and the country is very clean.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you never h- hear about that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- country, you know, causing problems or having problems. [NOISE]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So that's why, you know, I think that it would be the perfect country, close to the US but like, in Mexico for example, uh, you know, there is a lot of crime, they --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- steal all the --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and, [NOISE] um [NOISE] --
L:  There's a lot of unemployment too.
R:  That's right.
L:  And a lot of poverty.
R:  Right.
L:  And a lot of, um -- [MN] I don't think that they have a lot of the, uh, medical advances that, uh, we have as far as medical care, there, because you hear a lot of, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like, small children that have deformities or that need surgeries and things like that, that need to be brought --
R:  To the US.
L:  Yeah, like, I don't know, like, twins and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and some that have facial deformities, they always bring them to the US to have surgery and stuff done, so --
R:  Right.
L:  But I guess if I didn't need that, that wouldn't be that important because, uh -- well, I've been to Mexico and Mexico is beautiful.  I've been to Cozumel.
R:  I never went to Mexico myself, so --
L:  And, uh, it's -- it's beautiful but it's also sad to see the difference in the -- the tourist --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and then you see what like the -- [MN] like the tourist have all this money and then --
R:  But you know, I never --
L:  -- you see the locals and they -- they don't seem to have very much.
R:  I -- I never understood it because this is a country with, uh, very rich resource, they have a lot of, uh, oil, uh, they have --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- tourism and, you know, the government has never been able to -- to make their population, uh, enjoy the w- -- the wealth that they have actually in this country.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I think that's because the government is corrupt.  They have --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a lot of corruption.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, what's interesting too is, um, that [MN] I don't think that they put people to death in Mexico for crimes like they would, like in the US.
R:  Right.
L:  And that's why a lot of criminals and stuff, they like to flee to Mexico, like, if they're wanted for murder or whatever and they think they're gonna get a death sentence because, uh, uh, in Mexico I guess, uh, maybe religiously they don't believe in putting anybody to death.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, uh, th- that's interesting that there is so much crime but they don't wanna scare people and say, "Well, if you do the crime then this is what can happen to you" so --
R:  Right.
L:  S- --
R:  But I think the, uh, the army, the police, the government is very corrupt.
L:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
R:  And --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because they have so much wealth in this country.  I -- I -- I don't understand why people are so poor.  Yet --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, they have a lot of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- oil, I mean, why is it -- is it that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- people are so poor?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, you know, you take a country like Saudi Arabia where they have a lot of oil, you know, their people are -- are enjoying the -- the wealth.
L:  Mhm.  Uh, what would you miss about the US?
R:  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I guess, um, the family, you know, my --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, my family, my kids if they had kids then I could not go.  Um, I guess the convenience of a lot of things, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like, you said Walmart, you know, going, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, in the middle of the night to shop --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, I mean, uh --
L:  I've done that. [LAUGH]
R:  I lived, uh, in Europe for three years before we were in Virginia and my husband is in the military, and there were a lot of things that I missed, that you don't think about it but you miss when you don't have it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, so I guess the convenience and, uh, [NOISE] [LIPSMACK], um, civil rights --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I guess is important too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And people are more, uh, fairly honest in this country.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  If you go to Italy, to Mexico, when people are not, are just corrupt.  I mean --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- everybody -- they -- people are -- you -- you can't -- you can't trust them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And here you can trust people m- fairly, you know?
L:  Yeah.  It depends on -- it depends on where.  I -- I don't know, for some reason I trust more in a smaller -- smaller community.
R:  Right.
L:  With close knit --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- relationships than I would, f- I don't know, say in a big city like New York or --
R:  You know, I n- -- I never, uh, lock my -- my car because at one time we had the Jeep and the alarm was so mixed up and we just didn't lock it.  And guess what?  Nobody stole it here.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  We go to Europe --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and within three months, uh, somebody tried to -- to rob it and they, uh -- they just stole --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the, uh, I mean, they -- they destroyed the, uh, the keypad and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, somebody tried to s- -- to rob it, and here --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- nobody tried before.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I never locked it here.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And so --
L:  Yeah, and here where I live, uh, in Florida, um, they have been, uh, a couple of crimes where people leave their cars just in their -- in front -- front of their own homes with, um, the car not locked or the garage door open and the car -- car in the garage, and, uh, people have broken into their car.  We had, uh, that happen like, a couple of weeks ago.
R:  Really?
L:  So, um, [SIGH] uh, you know, and -- and this is a -- a, you know, you would think a safe neighborhood, not a lotta crime, lotta families, a lotta children and stuff but it's -- I guess it happens everywhere.
R:  Yeah.
L:  W- what would you do with your million dollars, like when you go to Costa Rica?
R:  Um, I would buy a house and then just enjoy it and just --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- live modestly, you know, so it can last.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then, uh, and then just enjoy it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Just enjoy life I guess.  What would you do?
L:  Oh, I probably would look for a nice home and, uh, and maybe some property too to go with it
