L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, my name is William.  How are you?
R:  Fine, thank you.  My name is Maxine.  
L:  Maxine?  Okay.  Where you from?
R:  I'm from West Virginia.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm down here -- I'm up in Pennsylvania.
R:  Okay.
L:  So let me ask you a question.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Pardon me?
L:  Let me ask you a question.
R:  Okay.  
L:  If I gave you a million dollars would you leave the United States?  Is that what this -- I think that's what the discussion is about?
R:  Um, I think they said if you, uh, I -- I might have misunderstood.  I thought they said that if you had a million dollars and had to leave the United States where would you go and what would you do?
L:  Uh, no, I'm pretty -- 'cause I listened to it twice.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah, that -- I think they were saying [MN] it -- it's not if I gave it to you but would you rather -- would you -- would you rather stay here, kind of?  Or if I gave you a million dollars would you be willing to leave the United States?  I think is what they were trying to come across with.
R:  Oh, and never return?
L:  [COUGH]  Yes, uh-huh.
R:  I don't --
L:  If that was [MN] --
R:  I don't think so.  
L:  You don't think you would?
R:  No.
L:  Oh.  Have you ever been outside the country?
R:  No.  But, um, to me, um, the United States is the best place, even though I haven't been anywhere else, I couldn't imagine living anywhere else and to me the United States is my home and it's the only place I'd want to live.  Poor.  
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  Rich or poor.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Rich or poor, huh?
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  Wow, that's [inaudible].
R:  How 'bout you?
L:  Well, I'm an army brat so I've lived in a couple of different places.  I lived in Germany when I was younger.  I lived in England.  Uh, I've seen most of the United States.  I've lived in Florida for, like, fourteen years.  I lived in, um, Colorado.  Uh, lived in Arizona.  Uh, lived -- actually I lived in Virginia Beach.
R:  Okay.
L:  So you're in West Virginia.  I was a little bit further east than you are, out on, uh, Virginia Beach.  But I lived over there for a year.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, now I'm up in Pennsylvania.
R:  Okay.
L:  And, um, let me a- -- have you ever been on any of these calls before?
R:  No, this is my first one.
L:  Yeah, this is my first one too. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  And I was playing around on the internet and ...  Uh, now my wife she's from Poland.  
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yes, and I've been to Poland several times.  Uh, my -- my parents are both deceased.  My wife's parents are both deceased.  And, uh, her whole family -- she's got eight brothers and sisters over there.
R:  So you -- basically, then, you would go to Poland then, right?
L:  Well, I would take a million dollars to leave this country.  'Cause I would think that, uh, there's a lot of people, I think, that are coming from Europe that are going back home to Europe when they retire and they're just collecting social security back there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Have you heard of anybody like that?
R:  No, that's all new to me.  
L:  Yeah, there's people that [MN] when they come from Italy or England, or different places, they come over here and they make money.  And then when it's time for 'em to retire a lot of times they'll go back to where their roots are.  
R:  Okay.
L:  And for me, as an army brat, I really don't have any roots.  Uh, this is a -- I guess a large portion of this country is not transient but a lot of it is transient.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, for the transient people that don't really have roots, uh, uh, I can't speak for anybody else but I wouldn't -- I wouldn't have a problem leaving this country, uh, whether I had a million dollars or not a million dollars.
R:  Mm.
L:  You know, I would go to Australia.  I would live there.  Uh, I would live in South Africa.  I would live in, uh, the Bahamas.  I would live, uh, in Europe, either in England.  Uh, uh, basically my understanding is now you can get off the plane in Germany and go apply for a job and get an apartment.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Sure.
R:  Well, on the other hand, I have a totally different view than you because I have, uh, family here, you know.  And my parents -- my mother is deceased, my father's still living.  Uh, I'm divorced but I have two sons.  Ages twenty one and sixteen.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, you know, like I said, uh, United States is my home.  I couldn't imagine living anywhere else.  Um, I just think I'd get too homesick.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, I -- I guess you have a lot of close ties here?
R:  Yes.
L:  'Cause a million dollars is a lot of money.  I know money isn't everything.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, uh, you know, when it comes to retiring in the United States I see -- I see an awful lot of people in the United States on retirement that are just -- just not doing very well.
R:  Yeah.  That's true.  
L:  And, uh, with the baby boomers coming of age, which I'm one of.
R:  How old are you?
L:  Uh, fifty three.
R:  Fifty three?  I'm thirty eight.
L:  Okay.  Uh, it's -- there's more and more people -- when I -- when I hit the retirement age it -- there's gonna be as many people in retirement as there are working.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Which means that by the time you're retired there's gonna be more people on retirement than there are working.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think.  But the -- the numbers are going at -- in that direction anyway.
R:  Well, I understand where you're coming from and if I were in your shoes I would probably, you know, look at it like you look at it, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess that's what this is all about.  Just each individuals own, you know, uh, [MN] points and views and, you know, this -- what they -- you know, what they feel.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, uh, you know, like I said, I -- I love the United States which I can't say that I wouldn't love it somewhere else because I've not been anywhere else outside of the United States.
L:  Yeah, there's a lot of guys over in Kuwait right now who still love the United [LAUGH] States, right?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  What -- you know, what it didn't ask, it -- well, I guess it said, would you move somewhere else?  I don't know if it said, would you move there and never come back?  In the beginning of the question?
R:  Mhm.  Well, I know, I [MN] it didn't say that.  Maybe if it was, uh, just like for a certain period of time I might be up for it but, you know, if it meant to leave and never live back here again, no I couldn't do it.  You know.
L:  Uh, yeah.  'Cause I know -- like when I lived in Florida was that there what they call down there snowbirds.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they live up here with the family half of the year and then they go down in the winter and live in Florida the other half of the year.
R:  Yeah, I've heard of that.
L:  Okay, so --
R:  Uh, matter of fact I know some people that do that.
L:  Okay.  And, uh, you know, so if it was like take a million dollars and leave the country and you can never come back, uh, yeah, that would be probably a lot harder for you than just that if you could come back from time to time.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, if I -- 'cause I could just, you know, be free to come and go as I please, you know, back and forth, that would be a totally different story, but I might have misunderstood the question.  I took it that maybe to take the million dollars and never come back but, you know ...
L:  Well, that -- that's pro- um, that's probably what they meant.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I tell you what we could do though.  We could say, why don't you give us each a million dollars ... [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  And we'll leave and see what happens.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  And then if we come back we have to give the million dollars back, maybe.  I don't know.
R:  Well, what's left of it.  
L:  Yeah. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, what's left of it.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  But, uh, for a million dollars, uh, uh, when I was in Florida I visited Costa Rica.  Uh, in Costa Rica you can have a, like a butler and a maid.  
R:  [MN]
L:  You can buy a house down there.  And you can have a butler and a maid do all your cooking and cleaning and everything for about fifteen dollars a month.  
R:  Wow.  
L:  Oh, yeah, there's people go -- there's a lot of American people retiring in Mexico, along the beaches.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because you -- because the difference in wages down there is so different.  I mean, a million dollars is a lot of money.
R:  Yeah, [MN] here anyway and then especially there it'd even be [MN] the sky's the limit, huh?
L:  Yeah, in any third world country.  Now maybe if you went to, like, you know, Paris or London, or something like that, it wouldn't mean as -- as much.  I mean, it'd probably --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- be the same as it is here.  But if you just want to kick back and relax and ...
R:  Mexico would be the ideal place then, wouldn't it?
L:  Uh, Mexico.  Anywhere in Mexico.  There's -- I think the islands would be expensive.  But --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- Costa Rica's a Central American country and, uh, uh, they have like a ninety seven percent literate -- they have a higher literacy rate than we do here in America.  'Course a lot of countries have that [LAUGH] now.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Well, I've knowed of a lot of people, you know, they go to Mexico and, you know, on vacation and, you know, they go down there and have a great time and they can bring back all kinds of things, you know.  'Cause they -- they say that everything is so cheap down there.
L:  Uh, it is.  And, uh, uh, [MN] like taxis or food or co- -- I mean, if you go to the resort areas, you know, you're gonna pay resort prices no matter where in the world you go.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh, uh, the -- the -- to me, even though my -- my dad spent twenty some years in the service and I spent my time in the service, uh, I'm -- I'm not as happy with the way America's going as I thought it was gonna be.  My wife is from Poland and when I met her --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- Poland was still communist.
R:  Mm.
L:  And she came over here on political +asylum when she was seventeen years old.  And, uh, I can't disagree with her too much but it seems like more and more that Eastern Europe and Europe is becoming more democratic and America's becoming more not so free.
R:  Mm.  Do you have children?
L:  Uh, no.  Uh, yeah, so it'd be real easy for me to pick up and go.
R:  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  Because, you know, you -- you don't have any ties, I mean, in -- I mean, you know, with your parents being deceased and her's, so it's just like, you know, just you and her.
L:  Uh, y- yeah, it's me and her and her whole --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- family which is in -- which is in Poland.
R:  Yeah, well, that's what I'm saying.  I mean, here in the United States, is what I'm saying.  Just ...
L:  Yeah and -- and if we were to take money and -- and leave this country I don't know that Poland is where we would end up.  I mean, she left Poland and we've been over there visiting and it's nice to go visit the family.
R:  Yeah.
