R:  Hi.
L:  [MN] Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, this is Lesley.
R:  Hi, it's Joelle.
L:  Hello, nice to meet you. [SIGH]
R:  You too. [LAUGH]
L:  This is weird! [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, very odd.  Um --
L:  Um --
R:  We have to [several inaudible words] --
L:  Okay, so if I had to go back in time and change something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- which would be wonderful, then, um, I never would have quit this one job that I had, 'cause it was a really good job and, it's kind of a weird job to get back into, so --
R:  How -- how come you quit it?
L:  Um, I just -- it was like, an office job but I mean I had excel- -- it was for the government and I had excellent benefits and I was getting paid really well --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and not having to do hardly anything.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I just got sick of working in an office.
R:  Oh boy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Are you -- are you like, a stay at home mom now or ...?
L:  Oh no, no, I'm a waitress right now, I'm searching for a job still at the moment.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  So what would you change?
R:  Um, I would change, um, a meeting that I had with a manager and not take that person for -- I'm an actress -- so I would, um, go back and not take that person's representation and not listen to their advice. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh yeah?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So but --
L:  Did that like --
R:  Huh?
L:  Did that -- did that turn out really bad?
R:  Well, yeah, I just think I've been given some bad advice and, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, you'd never know 'cause people tell you this or this that and the other thing and it's hard to tell who's telling the truth.
L:  Oh yeah, definitely.
R:  So yeah, I guess I would change that.  Um, what government -- like, what did you do for the government?
L:  Oh, I just l- did my clerical stuff but, um, I mean, more than that but ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, I was like a data operations ad- supervisor kind of thing.  Um, it was for Tricare, which is --
R:  I don't know who th- --
L:  -- a military health and -- huh?
R:  I -- I don't know who they are.  Tric- --
L:  Oh, it's military health insurance.
R:  Oh okay.
L:  And so I worked at the call center like, when people -- like when military people would call in to schedule appointments --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or whatever, then, um, I kept track of like, all the data for -- 'cause the government actually keep very meticulous records.  And I was only like --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- eighteen when I got the job, you know, it was because, you know [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh my goodness, so you must be still young.
L:  Yeah.  But I just had -- yeah, I'd had a lot of experience so [LIPSMACK] -- yeah, but then I quit! [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I d- -- I don't know, it -- an office job is not for me either, it's really hard to ...
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- to be in a corporate environment like that.
L:  Definitely.  I can't even -- I was just working at, um, like, Blockbuster Video and I couldn't even handle that.  I'm like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- this is [LAUGH] [inaudible] -- really!  I mean, I have to be able --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to dress how I want to and, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  [inaudible].
R:  Well this is a -- a good job, huh?  You get to talk on the phone. [LAUGH]
L:  I know!  I know.
R:  It's pretty neat.  I think there --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is a -- a special program that's trying to make out what we're saying, with the computer.
L:  Oh yeah?
R:  I don't know.  I think.
L:  I'm not sure.
R:  But I -- I think there's like, a new computer that, you know, can recognize words and ...
L:  Oh yeah, they have --
R:  Maybe it's --
L:  -- new programs where instead of typing you just speak.
R:  Yeah, I think.
L:  Voice recognition.
R:  I don't know.  Who knows?  Is there --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- anything else that you would change if you went back in time?
L:  Is -- anything else?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, yeah, probably people that I wasn't too nice to.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, I was never that horrible but, um --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I really wasn't, I mean I don't regret anything that bad --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- but there's just certain people that I wish I would've kept in touch with or maybe gave a chance when I didn't, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I think everyone has those little sayings like that.
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  [MN] So ...
R:  I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  If I could change anything else I would turn back time and have more fun and, you know, not try to rush through college.
L:  Oh really?
R:  [inaudible] school.  Yeah, I just really, really rushed through it all and, uh -- and now looking back with all -- you know, there's so much more responsibility, you think, "Oh, let me get it over with".
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then it's like, "Oh!". [LAUGH]  Not all that fun.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, I never -- I didn't go back to school.
R:  No.
L:  [LIPSMACK] I haven't -- I haven't yet.  [LIPSMACK] But [LIPSMACK] hopefully I will.
R:  Yeah, well, if --
L:  I'm gonna be [inaudible] --
R:  -- you do, have fun with it 'cause it's funner than real life I think.  Or more fun.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I graduated high school when I was like, seventeen.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] And then, um --
R:  [inaudible] early.
L:  And then -- yeah, and then I moved out on my own.  [LIPSMACK] So, I'm twenty now and that, so it's been like, three years of just working and being in real life, I haven't really had that much fun but --
R:  Wow.  And you're --
L:  No.
R:  -- on your own, that's good for you that you're, uh --
L:  Yeah.  Well, kind of but --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I'm sick of it, I wanna just go to school.
R:  Yeah?
L:  I'm gonna be moving down to Portland in about a month and I'm just gonna go.
R:  Which state are you in?
L:  I'm in Washington.
R:  Oh, I'm in California.
L:  Mm.
R:  So they -- they [several inaudible words] to whoever. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, I'll be moving down there and I'm just gonna try to go to school, so [several inaudible words] for it, mm, please.
R:  Mm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] So, we'll see.
R:  Well, hopefully --
L:  How long you been an actress for?
R:  Since I was five.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  But, you know, I did mostly theater and so I just moved out to LA to start doing some on television, it's a whole different world there, you're --
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  Totally different.  I --
L:  Theater would be fun.
R:  Huh?
L:  Theater would be really fun.
R:  Yeah, theater is great, you know, I'm from New York and, uh, that's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's really all there is there.  I -- I think that's more fulfilling to be honest with you.
L:  Oh yeah, definitely.  Well, it's much more real.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Not that I've had any experience but [LAUGH] --
R:  No, it is more real because you don't -- you do it one take, that's it [LAUGH], you don't have to go --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- back and ... you know.  So it's interesting.
L:  Hm.
R:  But ...  I just --
L:  So what was your favorite part that you've ever played?
R:  Um, there is a role in a play called Leader of the Pack.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I got to play Darleen[?] Love, who, um, is a singer.  I think it was, oh my God, sixties, fifties, I don't even remember now.
L:  Mm.
R:  Fifties or sixties.  She's a -- a really good like, soul singer -- singer gospel.
L:  Oh.
R:  So --
L:  Oh cool.
R:  Yeah.  It was really cool to play her.  But, um, I just joined this website, Money and Shopping, have you heard of it?
L:  You what?
R:  Did you hear of Money and Shopping before?
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  The website?  Oh, that's how I found out about this thing.
L:  The club called what?
R:  It's -- it's a website, Money and Shopping Network.
L:  Money and Shopping Network?
R:  Yeah, that's how I found out about this -- this phone call thing.
L:  Oh really?
R:  Yeah.  How'd you hear about it?
L:  [LIPSMACK] I just saw a thing in the newspaper, it just said, "You get thirty dollars for calling three times" so I'm like, "Oh, why not?" [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I might as well, I love talking on the phone, hey.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  Ten minute's actually longer than it seems! [LAUGH]
L:  I know, huh.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Is this the first time that you've done this?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Yeah.  You too or no?
L:  Yeah.  I tried to call one time and stayed on the phone for like, twenty minutes waiting for someone.  I'm like, "Okay, I'm not doing this".
R:  Yeah, it took a while to get through just now.
L:  Oh yeah?  Mine came on right away.
R:  Oh.
L:  So what was that website?  It was money and shopping?  Is there other stuff on there like this?
R:  Um, yeah, it's more like -- I just -- I just signed up for it, it cost me thirty dollars but then I found this right away so it pretty much paid for itself.
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, it's like for stay at home moms, w- not that I am but, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, it's good like, at home kinda work and -- and mystery shopping and ...
L:  Oh really?
R:  And all that.  Yeah, I just joined today but I've already, you know, with this job I've made it back so ...
L:  [NOISE] Wow, I should do that.
R:  It's so good, tr- you know, try this.
L:  Huh, I've been like -- that's what I've been all day today, is looking for a job.
R:  Oh really?  Well there is --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like I -- I've seen a newspaper article -- you have to watch out 'cause some of these, uh, mystery shopper sites are scams.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, I was -- was reading a newspaper, in the article some girl was like, a big stockbroker and then she didn't know what to do 'cause she got laid off, and she basically got paid to go on vacation [LAUGH] like, you know, go golfing and whatever.
L:  Gosh.
R:  And she -- she's actually making really good money from it.
L:  Wow.
R:  So that's what she does full time.  They pay her to go eat.  It's almost like, it's not even just so much the pay but you can get like, meals out of it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and maybe some clothes or [LAUGH], you know, it's just -- and you can take people with you to a lotta things.
L:  Yeah.  That'd be kinda, I don't know, do you have to do it full time though?
R:  No, it's part time.
L:  Oh okay.
R:  You have to -- you have to really apply to all the companies and it's just when they call ya.
L:  Yes.
R:  She did it full time, the one girl.  She did it as an actual job.
L:  Um, because you couldn't like, do anything else.  I don't know, it wouldn't be very fulfilling, it's like, "What do you do?"  "Nothing, I just go to people [inaudible] --"
R:  Well, they'll pay you like, maybe a hundred dollars to go test drive a car, you know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and then when you go test drive the car they give you fifty dollars gift certificate for somewhere else.
L:  Mm.  Yeah.
R:  yeah, it's something to do. [SIGH]
L:  It's a good trade off I guess. [NOISE]
R:  Yep.
L:  Mm.  Well, it's been ten minutes, I don't know what they're doing! [LAUGH]
R:  Has it?  'Cause I haven't been looking at the ...
L:  Yeah, I think so. [NOISE]
R:  It should come on
