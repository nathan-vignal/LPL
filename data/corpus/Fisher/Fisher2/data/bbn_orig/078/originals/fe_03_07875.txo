L:  Hello, this is Howard from San Francisco.
R:  Hi, this is Charity from Gloucester, Virginia.
L:  How are you?
R:  Fine, how are you?
L:  Not too bad.  This is kind of weird.
R:  Yeah, I've never done this before.
L:  So, if you had a chance to go back and do something, what would you -- what would you change?
R:  [SIGH] Well, I don't know, I was trying to think about it in that brief amount of time.  Um, I think I would change, um, [LIPSMACK] the age at which I started dating.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think I would have waited a little longer before, um, I started dating 'cause this way I would have had a chance to, um, view -- you know, see other -- not see more people but just -- how -- I -- come to know myself better, I guess.  I think I would, um, go back and -- and do more things for myself before I started getting into boys, I guess. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think that would probably be the thing that I would, um, want to change because, you know, when you start dating early, I guess, you start to lose yourself quicker, I think, and -- and then as you get older you kind of think --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- about, um, things that you wish you would have done for yourself, so --
L:  And I think --
R:  -- that's probably what I would change.
L:  -- for -- for -- for me if I were to have to change something I probably would go back and I probably would have started, um, graduate school right after I got out of college.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Um, only because I've been out of what, college now for about ten years --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and it probably would have been a wiser decision maybe if I went right into graduate school --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that way I think I would have had more experience behind me when possibly looking for a job.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, so that probably was a good thing for me to look at, I think, as far as, um, nowadays the economy is not that great.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I think the more that you can have behind you when you're looking for a job, the better off you're going to be.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  So, that probably would be my thing as far as looking at, um, you know, what I would change if I could go back in time.
R:  Mhm. [MN]
L:  And, um, I don't think there's anything else that I can think of.
R:  Another thing that you might change?
L:  Yeah, I think that I would of -- well, I would of liked to adopted a child.
R:  Mm.
L:  I think that would have been something good to do, uh, I'm thinking, now that I'm getting too older -- too old now, to do something like that, um, I guess you're never too old, but --
R:  No.
L:  -- you know, that would have been something --
R:  Not for kids, kids -- kids love you no matter -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, you hope so, right? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, no matter how old you are, yes.
L:  But that might have been an option I might have looked at with adoption --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when I was younger --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and if I had someone else that could support the child with me --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- those are things that I can think of.
R:  Yeah, I was trying to think of, uh, some other things that I might change.  You know when you were talking about graduate school, the thing that I might change was, um -- I went for school for one year and I really didn't know what I was doing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then the second year I -- I had an opportunity where I could have taken a break and I didn't and I probably should have because I graduated with a degree that -- well, for a lot of people that happens, but, you know, it's doing nothing for me now, [LAUGH] so ...
L:  What did you graduate with?
R:  I graduated with an international studies degree.
L:  And I have an international management degree.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, see, so [LIPSMACK] it didn't really do me a lot of good, I -- I mean, I don't know about you but -- [LAUGH] it, um --
L:  I don't know but for me it was good because I had management.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, for me it was a good safe way when you take a foreign language because I'm also bilingual in Spanish --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that's one of my other degrees from college.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, you know, I would have possibly, maybe changed something -- I would have liked to have learned more languages --
R:  Oh, ye- absolutely.
L:  -- you know, that could have been something that would have been feasible if I could go back in time and, you know, change something.  Sure, I would have loved to have learned five languages --
R:  Oh, absolutely, yes.
L:  -- you know, if that would have been possible.  But, you know, that -- that would just be almost impossible, you know, to do something like that.
R:  Right, I know, I -- I would love to -- to learn --
L:  I mean, I studied abroad for two years --
R:  I studied abroad too.
L:  Uh, where did you --
R:  Just a --
L:  -- study?
R:  I studied in, um, well Costa Rica I just went for a month and then I went to Mexico for about a month and a half, so ...
L:  Okay, 'cause I was in Spain for, like, a little bit over a year --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and if I could go back now, I would have to stay there longer.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  But I know that would have delayed me, you know, graduating from college --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but I think, in the long run, it would have benefited me in a lot of ways.
R:  Right, the experience would have been invaluable, absolutely.  I know, because when I, um, studied abroad, I thought it was so neat because there was someone there that was at the, um, language school that I was at, that spoke Chinese, couldn't speak English but I could talk to them in Spanish, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  And I just think that's so interesting, so, yeah, that would be neat to -- to learn more languages.  Especially when you're younger it's a lot easier to learn languages, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- yeah, going back in time to learn languages might not be a bad thing either.
L:  But, I'm -- I'm not thinking of too much else that I can think of as far as going back in time and -- you know, the only other thing is maybe having a better relationship with my parents.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think if I could maybe go back and I think I probably maybe took them for granted a little bit too much.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, you know, I think everybody says that --
R:  Right [LAUGH]
L:  -- but I wish that maybe I would have had a better relationship -- I mean, I have a great relationship with my parents now but if I could have gone back and had a better relationship when I was younger, with my parents --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I think that that might have been, um, a more positive thing for me growing up as a child.
R:  Right.
L:  Um --
R:  Yeah, it's a lot easier for that one, it's a lot easier looking back to see the things -- [LAUGH]
L:  Sure and saying, "What could I have done to change", you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but now it's, like, you know, you've already gone ahead so many years, it's, like, it's impossible to just turn back time and, um, you know, go back --
R:  Right.
L:  -- ten -- fifteen years in time, what would I have done.  And maybe I would have treated my sister better --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- 'cause I think when I was younger I had one sibling that I probably didn't treat her as good as what I do now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But when you're a child and you're a kid, you know, you're always, like, getting into fights and things like that, just in a normal kids type of stuff.
R:  Right.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah, that would be a good thing because I would like to go back --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and -- and have a more open relationship with my mom --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- 'cause now I'm finding it mo- -- when I want to be more --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- open with her it's harder --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- now to be open with her, I guess.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because, y- you know, just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just because of our past.
L:  Right.
R:  So, that's kind of been the theme, keeping secrets --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so -- [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's kind of hard now to get her to open up, um, too.
L:  Now, have you done this before, or is it your first time?
R:  No, this is my first time, I've never done this before.
L:  So, like, what happens?  Do they tell us when the time is up and it stops --
R:  I don't know [LAUGH].
L:  -- and clicks us off or do we just keep going?
R:  I don't know, I -- I -- I imagine we just stop I think.  I don't know.
L:  Or does the phone --
R:  I mean, 'cause I don't think they --
L:  -- just click off and that's it?
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know.
L:  'Cause [NOISE] I know they're tape [NOISE] recording our phone conversation. [NOISE]
R:  Right, yeah, I have, like --
L:  So, can you think of anything else while we're on the line?
R:  Um, I don't think so.
L:  [NOISE] I would have liked to have made more money when I was younger [NOISE] [MN].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Go back and in time if I think of some schemes to make more money.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, that would -- that wouldn't be bad either.  So, you've been out of school for how long?
L:  I've been out of school for about ten years --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- out of college.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And I graduated in nineteen ninety four.
R:  Yeah.  I've been --
L:  So --
R:  -- at high school just about that long. [LAUGH]
L:  My cordless phone is beeping so it may click off at any time, so in case we lose connection that's what's happening.
R:  Okay.
L:  And I'm assuming we're probably at that time anyway.  It's pretty soon.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I think that's about all I can think of, so ...  What was your name again?
L:  My name is Howard.
R:  Howard, well again, my name is Charity, it's nice to meet you. [NOISE]
L:  It's nice meeting you too, where are you from?
R:  Uh, Virginia.
L:  Virginia, okay.
R:  Yeah, Gloucester.
L:  It's a little bit later over there.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah, it's about nine o'clock or so.
L:  It's weird how they just match up people that quickly.
R:  I know, I was, like, "Well, how long should I wait?" I wasn't waiting very long, but, you know, I was just listening --
L:  They said, all of a sudden --
R:  -- to the music. [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's, like, "You have a match", and I was, like, "That was quick".
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  [MN]
L:  All right, well I guess that's it and --
R:  Okay.
L:  And you have a good one and it was nice talking --
R:  You too.
L:  -- with you.
R:  All righty, bye bye.
L:  Okay, bye.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello? [NOISE]
