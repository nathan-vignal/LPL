L:  Oh hi, yeah, I'm Lee Kensey Taylor[?].
R:  Oh, Lee K- -- Lee?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Oh, I'm Pat, Pat Mullane.
L:  Hi, Pat.
R:  Where are you?  I'm in Brooklyn.
L:  I'm in Seattle, Washington.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well [MN] --
R:  We're getting all your rain here, you know.
L:  Huh?
R:  We're getting all your rain, you're usually very rainy.
L:  No we're not all that much.  I love Seattle weather.  Uh, the tax here is just too high but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, I wouldn't mind, uh, I don't think I'd wanna, uh, leave the, uh, the US --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- because I a- -- I do feel halfway safe here.
R:  Yeah.  And it's family.  The, uh, the situation is, I would take the million and go it -- but it said never return.  So your family would be all here.
L:  That's -- we could send for our family if we were to leave.
R:  [LIPSMACK] I know, I w- --
L:  Where would you go though?
R:  I would al- -- I always wanted to go to Australia.
L:  Oh how nice.
R:  You know, I always wanted to go there but it's so, you know, popular.  It's like it just reminds me of like, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's kinda like the old west, in the middle but yet --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- the city's on the end, you know.
L:  Mhm.  Now, I saw, uh, a town in Alaska that never have nighttime, I think I could go there! [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, but that would only be 'cause the -- the -- that can't be all year.  That's only -- it's like, half the year.
L:  Well, oh -- okay, well --
R:  [MN] And it -- it -- it's cold there in Ala- -- but Alaska's United States.
L:  Oh, it is?  Oh okay, well [SIGH].
R:  Yeah, and so is Hawaii.  It's like the kids, I -- I said, "No, not in the country".  They say, "Alaska, or Hawaii". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um 
R:  I don't know, I might -- I might -- if I had the million -- because a million isn't as much a- -- isn't as much as you think it is once you have it.  I mean, when you don't have it it seems like a lot.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But the --
L:  But, uh, how much would the tax people take?
R:  How much tax?
L:  Mm.
R:  Well, uh, if you left the States you wouldn't owe tax here.
L:  Oh, you would- -- oh, you wouldn't?  [PAUSE]  Pat?
R:  Yeah, I'm trying to think, um --
L:  Oh.
R:  Uh, you know, actually, 'cause you got it when you were here and you owe -- and -- and if you were a citizen -- I never -- I never did that kind, I do like, individual taxes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] you would owe -- theoretically you owe tax on worldwide, on income.  If you're a citizen of -- of America, United States, and if you have money and even if you made money in, uh, like the Caribbean or even in Europe or any place, if you -- any place that you made money, in theory, you owe tax on it, to the government.
L:  [MN] Definitely, mhm.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And then I'm, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I'm on -- on disability so I know they would want money. [MN]
R:  Yeah, but they can't get money back from you.
L:  I know.  That's why I say, well --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- how -- I wonder how much they would take?
R:  Well, I --
L:  The government.
R:  Well, I don't know because like, most -- most other countries have, uh, national health.  [SIGH] Uh, don't -- I think it's only us and South Africa --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- that don't have a national health policy.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, the major companies, I mean, I'm not talking like, Africa or something, uh, you know what I mean?  But I mean, real -- the countries that aren't third world --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Have like, national health.
L:  Uh.
R:  So, uh, [MN] I don't know.  I don't feel that safe here because -- well, I'm in -- I'm in New York [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So it's, you know.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  E- ever since then, you know, they -- I mean, you don't feel safe about anything.  And then you hear the other day a story about my bridge, they want to blow it up.
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  The Brooklyn bridge.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, uh --
L:  So --
R:  And it's just so easy here.  Have you ever been to New York?
L:  Yes, uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  'Cause, you know, the subway, it would be so easy for something to happen.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We are just so lucky and fortunate that nothing else has happened.
L:  Yeah.  It was so sad, nine eleven.  I n- -- I never forget that day.
R:  I- it was just so unbelievable, it was just --
L:  Yes it was, mhm.
R:  And, uh, you know, you still don't, um, you know, I don't go to Manhattan that much but, uh, [SIGH] you know.  I never -- I never liked 'em when they were there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I didn't thought they -- never thought they should've been there and I always thought they should've left the e- -- the Empire State Building, you know, the tallest building.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, 'cause my mother used to work right there on the battery and I used -- and I always remember how it was before they were built and I didn't -- but, you know, and then when it happened and -- and, you know, they were mine not to like, you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah, huh huh.
R:  But, um, it's just so scary and we've been very blessed as a country that we've never been attacked before.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I think it's a whole new world now.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And so that's why I would like to be in the countries.
L:  Oh.
R:  So I would probably the money and go because --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- all right, it's not as easy as it was to get across the border, like at Canada or something like that --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but I'm sure [MN] you --
L:  Well, if you went to Australia would you have to take all those shots?
R:  Probably some shots.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [MN] Or even Canada, Canada's close enough.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  If you wanted to [inaudible] the [inaudible].  But it's cold in Canada so -- I mean, I think of it as cold, I'm sure there's places that it's not that cold but it's just -- I would think I would go to Australia.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then -- and, you know, I'd have enough money to send for tickets for the grandkids.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [MN]
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  And, uh, you know, I'd get a plot of land and, you know, and just do things, you know.
L:  You could have a farm there couldn't ya?
R:  Yeah, that's what I'd like to have.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And things where you weren't dependent on things, like solar power.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and, uh, wind things and -- and a running source of water, so that you weren't dependent --
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  -- on anything.
L:  Right.
R:  That's what I would like.  [inaudible] with [inaudible] --
L:  I would too.
R:  I -- I would leave without it if I -- if that would give me the money to get started and have that.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [MN]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, uh --
L:  So, it's raining there in -- where are you at, New York, what part?
R:  In Brooklyn.
L:  Mm.
R:  But, uh --
L:  So how -- where is the -- how does the, uh, uh, the Statue of Liberty, isn't that in Brooklyn?
R:  No.  Well, you can see it from downtown.  It's in the water between Jersey and New York.
L:  Uh-huh.  [LIPSMACK] Well where, uh, um, uh, how about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the United Nations, how does that look now, where all those flags were?  I haven't been there --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- since the sixties.
R:  Yeah.  Okay, well, it's still over there, you know, that's across town.  That's --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- on the other river, 'cause the -- Manhattan is between the two rivers.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So the Statue of Liberty is in the one river, near Jersey, between Jersey and New York, and the UN is on the other side, by the East River.
L:  Uh-huh.  Off of, uh, uh --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- um --
R:  In the forties.
L:  Yeah, not too far, uh, from the-- from -- from the Bronx.
R:  Yeah.  It's very pretty, I had lunch there one day.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It was very -- it was very exciting.
L:  Wasn't that, I bet.
R:  [MN] 'Cause my friend's mother used to work there so I, uh, he knew how to get us in and -- and we went there --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, uh, we had lunch and all the people were there talking all the different languages.
L:  Mm, mm.
R:  It wa- -- it was quite interesting.
L:  All right.
R:  I always thought we gave 'em too much power though.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because, uh, you know, it made a little country in some instances as powerful as a big country.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And then they had those people on -- on some -- some countries like Libya on charge of human rights, on the Human Rights Council.
L:  Wow.
R:  I mean, it doesn't make sense to me.
L:  No.
R:  I always thought we shouldn't give them so much power.  I don't --
L:  Mm.
R:  Take the one world thing, I'm not for the one world thing.  I think if I'm here, if I didn't leave and have the million dollars, I just like us to be our own thing, not -- not with other people that have the right to tell us what to do.
L:  Right, uh-huh.  I think it's just too many, um, they have let so many, um, foreigners, into this, uh, into the States that a lotta 'em was -- was getting killed on boats, you know, they was hideaways, stowaways.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- uh-huh.  Um [inaudible] --
R:  That's so sad that they have to go through that when there's so many easier ways, you know?
L:  Uh-huh.  Why would they wanna take a chance like that anyway?
R:  I don't know because they get all killed.  Well, no, because of money.  I mean, you're working in a factory for like, ten dollars a month, you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And you're making nothing and your life is terrible.
L:  Okay, but listen, how did those immigrants get here in the United States and get all these brand new houses and business and brand new cars?
R:  Okay, um, well, because I tell ya, the tax service stinks.  I mean, the tax service, it goes after people that work and that's who they get.  Uh, and the foreigners come in, especially like here, I got Russians on the corner, the Ru- -- the Russians, I always respected Russia and the people, and from the writings, you know, from [inaudible] and things that they went through, but the people are very, very rude.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And they're very pushy and they don't have manners.
L:  that's the same thing that's going on here in Seattle, Washington.  We've got so many Cambodian and +Vietnam, [LIPSMACK] I mean, +Vietnamese people, they've got all the businesses, all around the black folks and the white people, you know.
R:  Is there segregation there?  Like, is -- is there a black section or is everybody mixed up?
L:  Well, it's -- it's -- they got different areas that have -- supposed to be all black, but they've got
