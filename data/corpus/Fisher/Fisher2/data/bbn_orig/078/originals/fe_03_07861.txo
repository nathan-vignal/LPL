R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, my name is Mary.
R:  Hi, Mary, I'm Sue, how are you?
L:  I'm okay.
R:  Good.  Um, so I guess we have our topic tonight.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Business.  What kind of a business would you like to open?
L:  I have never wanted to open my own business.
R:  Ever, ever?
L:  Never.
R:  Ha.
L:  How about you?
R:  Well, actually I'm in law school and so kind of in an indirect way I will be. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, yes, you sure will.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that's kinda built in though.
R:  It is kinda built in but you know, you're still kinda going according to what the firms want.
L:  Yes.
R:  And so if I really had my druthers, you know, like winning the lottery --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- or the billion dollar pepsi, um, I'm in Boston and I used to live in LA, and kinda if I had my druthers what I would do would be open offices in both coasts. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh wow, yes.
R:  And, uh, do art and cultural property law out of my own, you know, my own little office.
L:  Art and cultural property law.
R:  Property law.
L:  How absolutely fascinating.  And you poor thing, you'd have to travel all over the world.
R:  Yeah, you know! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So [LAUGH] --
R:  Well actually -- actually what it ha- mostly has to do with is, uh, making sure that artists, you know, that their rights are enforced when it comes to renting out space so they can paint or sculpt or whatever.  Um, [LIPSMACK] working out contracts for the galleries --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and potential buyers.  Um, make -- following up on if their painting or sculpture has sold, you know, they have a certain amount of rights that carry with it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- believe it or not.  Um, you know, there's copyrighting it and making sure that nobody is, you know, taking advantage of it, you know, if they make a picture it doesn't end up on an ad somewhere in, you know, Timbuktu --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, without their permission.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So that kinda stuff and --
L:  Yeah, I'm kind of aware of it, I have a friend in the field but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so how [MN] -- how will you go about setting yourself up, are you going to work in an existing firm?
R:  Yeah, that's probably what's gonna end up happening, but this is about if we had our druthers.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  So, and -- and I think that, um, [LIPSMACK] that notwithstanding I think I'd also like to do appraisals.
L:  Oh, art appraisals.
R:  [MN] Or, yeah, and antiques.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And collectibles.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I have a little bit of a knack for that.
L:  So you can have a few things to fall back on.
R:  Yeah, allegedly. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  See, what always made me nervous about my own business.
R:  Mhm.
L:  A couple of things.  One is, um, I've always had jobs that are very demanding and take a lot of hours but --
R:  Right, right, right, right.
L:  -- I feel that would be doubly and triply so if I had my own business.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  And then the r- --  you know, it's just like renting as opposed to buying a house, of course you wanna buy a house but on the other hand if you were renting --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- somebody else fixes, you know, fixes this and that.
R:  Right.
L:  Plus insurance and that kind of security, uh, oddly enough I've never actually had a job that's all that secure and yet I feel, uh, and perhaps that's, uh, misl- you know, uh, uh, uh, I'm wrong! [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right, right, right, yeah.
L:  But actually I always think I have more security by working for someone else.
R:  Yeah, and but you know what's amazing is, and I've been reading a lot about this, is that because there is so much insecurity right now, particularly with the recession, a lotta people are just opening up their own.
L:  Oh, computer businesses.
R:  Uh, they're opening up computer businesses, they're, uh, doing consulting work --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- on -- on their own little field.
L:  Now see, consulting was something that would interest me actually.  That's --
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- one of the few things I've thought I would do based on the s- -- the things I've done --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, and -- and the experience --
R:  What i- -- what -- now what have you done?
L:  I was in retailing initially in --
R:  Oh really?
L:  -- uh, my early career.
R:  Okay, yeah.
L:  And then I -- in retail management -- and then I quit and went to college, and now I have been in municipal management.
R:  Really?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yes, a little town manager.  Yes.
R:  Oh, good for you.  I'm involved in politics myself.
L:  Well, see, and I always think I'm -- I fool myself into thinking I'm not involved in politics --
R:  Oh yes you are.
L:  -- 'cause I'm an appointed person --
R:  That's -- that's what business all its own.
L:  -- I'm not -- yes, you're exactly right. [LAUGH] 
R:  See now, that's why I'm sticking with art and cultural property law because, um, so if I run for office nobody can call me one of those [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, that's absolutely true.
R:  That's absolutely true.  Yeah, because, you know, a lot of it has to do with property and land use and so on and so forth, which -- so that's [NOISE] all up my alley.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yes.  In of course a different sense but it's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's pretty much the same thing.
R:  It is pretty much the same thing, yeah.  My daddy was in retail.  W- what kinda area did you work in?
L:  Oh my gosh, I was in discount stores.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Discount department stores.  Um, and they were huge and we sold everything and oh my word, you -- you know, you just -- the day started and it never ended [LAUGH] and it just [LAUGH] --
R:  And it never ended.  I know, my second word -- my first word was go, my second word was inventory.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH] I mean, that's [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  My daddy was little, he walked in through the front door with me, come bring me home from the hospital for the first time and he got a call that he was being transferred.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I mean, it just -- oh yeah, I know that world.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I mean, I -- it's vi- vicariously --
L:  It's just so demanding.  And then you always --
R:  It is.
L:  -- you always have the weekends, you always have the nights.  And -- and even if, you know, you're in a position that you don't really have it, you still have it.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  You know, as long as the store is open --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- you're gonna have to worry about it.
R:  Well -- well, hell, he used to sleep with his pants on in case --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- the alarm company called.  You know, and he had to go.
L:  [LAUGH] Exactly.
R:  Which made for a couple of very fun April fools jokes on my part.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So you're quite the clever child there. [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I [LAUGH] -- I was, uh, yes I was. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It was terrible though --
R:  I'm surprised I survived to be twelve. [LAUGH]
L:  Particularly Christmas time.
R:  Uh-huh.  Oh yeah.
L:  You know, it was so exhausting and then especially being a female and maybe you're expected to create the dinner and the cookies and all the rest.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  And then you get home and like all I could do was barely keep my head out of the turkey, you know, and not fall --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- asleep in -- in -- in my plate and --
R:  Well, daddy used to come home and he would want the Christmas carols off.
L:  Mm.
R:  'Cause he got so sick of listening to them piped in.
L:  'Cause it starts so early and you got it all day.
R:  Yeah.  And he got it all day, he wanted no part of it, Christmas day he went to bed. [LAUGH] 
L:  This is talking me into my own business you know. 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But that is, that's, uh, you know, I mean, I totally understand that but, you know, there are a lotta people though too who have the utmost satisfaction of -- of having their own business.  And I think because y- you know, they are the one calling the shots.  And I think that everybody at some point says, "I could do that better".
L:  Yes.
R:  "Management sucks".
L:  Yes.
R:  [LAUGH] Like, you know!  "I could do this".
L:  I just think people also need basic training.  I think there are things people are lacking today a lot of the time.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  Their -- little manners, things like that, little -- little polish [LAUGH] -- things that are -- are very meaningful, a- are lacking and, uh, in --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- in every field you see it.
R:  Oh absolutely.  I mean, this is one of the things even from law, you know.  I mean, I -- I n- know -- see we're attorneys basically and m- m- I mean no disrespect to the profession in general, I mean, r- referring to individual attorneys who don't realize that -- that person they're representing is a customer.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And a- a- you know, it's, um, [LIPSMACK] -- and to me it is about service, even if you are one of those educated attorney types.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, 'cause you've gotta do customer service. [LAUGH]
L:  Absolutely, or you're not gonna keep them.
R:  Or you're -- yeah, I mean --
L:  You know.
R:  -- there's so many -- and especially right now the market is so bad that, you know --
L:  My experience has always been the best professionals, when I try to get -- like, if I'm gonna pay the same amount of money I wanna --
R:  Right.
L:  -- get the better doctor.  I'm gonna --
R:  Right.
L:  -- get the better lawyer, if I can.
R:  You're gonna get the one who listens to you.
L:  [MN] And you know what?  The -- the bigger they are the more, uh, articulate, the more they do listen, the --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- the more out -- it's just professionalism.
R:  It shows.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  [MN] You know.
L:  I -- and -- and the others that are arrogant and snitty are the ones --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- who, you know, they're wannabes.  I find.  You know, uh, of course that's not universally true.
R:  Oh, [MN] it's not universally true but you know, there are enough of them to make it appear so.
L:  So how long do you have to go?
R:  Uh, I'm in my last year.
L:  Wow.
R:  And I was one of those, this is one thing I was gonna mention, I was one of those who went back to school later as well.
L:  Oh! [LAUGH]
R:  So I'm -- I'm like, in my early forties and, you know, I'm -- I've finally finished that bachelors and finally finished, you know, finishing law school and --
L:  Are you moving straight through?
R:  Uh, no, actually I go evenings and I work during the day, for a law firm.
L:  Oh, that's tough.
R:  Yeah.  So, I mean it's -- but you know, it's one of those -- basically it's like starting your own business because, you know, you're putting in a commitment, you --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- really are putting in a commitment and you can't say, "Oh well, I'm bored with this" you know, not when you're facing a hundred and something thousand dollars in student loans.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You don't have time to say, "I'm bored with this".
L:  Absolutely.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I was fortunate -- it took me a while but I did get rid of them.  But you know, my solicitor, you know how every little town has their solicitor --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, she -- [MN] I had, you know, I had words with her once, she kept always saying, "Well, we're the same" because we were appointed as opposed to elected, you know --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- they can get rid of us.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, "Yes" I said, "We're the same except you have how many communities?  I've -- this is it, this is my life, they can me I'm on the street!" [LAUGH] You know?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "You have other, uh, many other clients --"
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  "And so there's, I -- I see that as a difference, my dear.  Plus you've got this trade, you know, that -- that's it.  You -- you do what you do and no one can take that from you."
R:  Right.
L:  "Once that license is there, you know, that is absolutely yours".
R:  Absolutely.
L:  And, um, you know, so that's [MN] and you have to do -- is it like doctors, you have to have basic law first before you specialize?
R:  Uh, yeah, pretty much, they have a curriculum that you have
