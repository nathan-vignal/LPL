R:  Ralina[?] Rutland.
L:  Mike Gedampskey[?].
R:  Hi.
L:  How you doing?
R:  [LAUGH]  Oh, I'm doing good.  I didn't think I'd get anybody.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I tried [inaudible] earlier and I'm like, "I guess no one wants to talk about this".
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, uh, you want to give your view?
L:  Um, I guess, it depends on the friend and stuff and the situation.
R:  Mm.
L:  But, overall, I guess, I believe in the truth over lying for somebody.
R:  Right.
L:  Especially when you get in legal circumstances.
R:  Right.
L:  Because then you're putting your own values on the lines.  Not only your values but your image.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And your reputation, and I don't think that's worth lying for somebody.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  But I -- but I know already, uh, in fact, just at work recently somebody else said, oh, yeah, like twenty years ago [MN] this one guy he didn't like -- this younger guy was getting his head bashed in by this other guy at work and you -- [LAUGH] you wouldn't think that would happen but maybe twenty years ago.  
R:  Right.
L:  And he had seen the situation and they came to him and said -- said, um, [LIPSMACK] "Oh, did you see this and was this guy doing this?"  And he lied.  
R:  Right.
L:  And, uh, so and he's actually kind a bragging about this and I'm thinking, well, you did that because you didn't like the other guy but it's like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- even if it was twenty years ago what am I thinking of you now?  I'm --
R:  Oh oh.
L:  -- thinking -- I'm thinking, uh, I don't trust [LAUGH] you.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  If you're gonna do that.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  'Cause if I had -- if -- if I had somebody mug me and -- and beat me up you just might leave me out there [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]: 
R:  -- to die.  I don't know the man.  I don't know who you're [LAUGH] talking about.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Wow.  Wh- -- I -- my personal stance would be, um, I wouldn't do it at all.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, this is my moral beliefs.  Um, usually -- this my thing is that it -- it will always catch up with you.  In some way or somehow that stuff starts to catch up with you.  And, man, when it bites you in the butt it's just -- it's, um -- it's -- it's not as fun as when you did it.  [LAUGH]  You know what ...? [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know and so, um, um, but there have been some situations have been rather tempting and, um, just for the sake of getting the heat off, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, you know, saying that for -- I -- I -- at least I'm thinking of maybe family members.  [SIGH]  And, uh, I don't -- what's -- I don't think it was really legal but just, you know, lying for family members, uh, because by doing that then you would, uh, [MN] you know, keep maybe the family secrets all under hush hush, you know, and -- and there would be no big deal with that but, um, I just -- I've never seen any positive results come from it.  Or at least if there are th- -- it's really short term.  You know, and then you've got this big mess.
L:  Guilt trip?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, that you're trying to like halt -- well, I did it for this reason.  [LAUGH]  You know.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  So, um, so that's where I stand on [MN].
L:  Yeah, I think too, uh, the biggest factor is, uh, is the family member or how long have you know this person and then if they're talking you into it, you know, "Can you vouch for me?"
R:  Right.
L:  So tho- those are some big factors and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and unfortunately then you're almost saying to that person well, if you don't they're looking at you like, well, why aren't you?
R:  Right.
L:  At the same time, you know, [MN] you need to look at it and say, "Well, um, are you really my friend if you're forcing me to do something that isn't -- immoral to [inaudible]?"
R:  Right.  What -- what type of answer would you give to someone?  'Cause I know there are people that consider [MN] um, the morals are really not an issue.  It's really a -- whatever circumstance calls for.  Um, how do you talk to someone in that instance?  I mean, if he's got a friend that, you know, "Well, I'm not into the moral thing.  I'm just, whatever, comes up and if it's appropriate for that time then I'll do what I need to do".
L:  I think [SIGH] the bottom line, again, is -- is -- I don't know, how you get away -- away from being the --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- moral [LAUGH] issue.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  'Cause I talk -- I guess, I -- I talk with my, um, uh [MN] my sister, and a lot when she was in college it, you know, 'cause we were rid with morals.  A- -- but I noticed when she was in college it just kinda switched up a little bit.  Well, it's kind of depends on the situation and circumstances.  I'm going -- and I -- I don't think I got very far in the conversation but I don't know.  I just -- I, um, it's like -- to me it's like gravity.  You know.  You -- you can play with gravity but generally the stuff comes down.  You [LAUGH] know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and when it comes to [MN] making decisions according to circumstances, you kind a get -- it gets a little h- hairy.  Because, uh, uh, you can't keep it straight, you know.  Um, especially -- and I guess maybe it's easier to do if it doesn't affects you.  But then if something affects you then you want morals and you want [LAUGH] standards.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Maybe that's [LAUGH] what it is.  [LAUGH]  Oh, man.
L:  Yeah, [MN] -- yeah, 'cause I guess, you know, 'cause they're probably saying, "Well, hey, I need this help.  Can you help me?"  
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]  "Why won't you do this for me?"
R:  Right.
L:  So [MN] you know, the guilt trip is on you and you're like, "Well, should I or shouldn't I?"  And I think a lot of people would probably just say, "Well, I'll do it, it's for a friend".  
R:  Right.
L:  And what would [MN] -- what will it hurt?  
R:  Right.
L:  So, yeah, like you said, you just -- it depends on the circumstance but, um, if you do it once you'll start doing it all the [LAUGH] time.
R:  Right.  Right.  Or, uh, I'm even thinking is, uh, like some of the, uh, the business dealings that [MN] I guess some of the -- I don't watch all the news and read everything.  I just catch little snippets and stuff but [SIGH] I'm trying to think of the logic [MN] mm, or that maybe the -- I guess the logic behind doing it as a business partner.  Um, m- maybe it keeps the person in business longer or so, or something.  Or ...
L:  Okay.  
R:  It -- I don't know.  I -- I -- dude, I'm asking [LAUGH] 'cause [MN] -- 'cause I -- you already know where I stand but I'm just trying to think of why someone would do that if it -- as a partner, a business partner, other than money or ...
L:  Well, I think, too, nowadays with a lot of stuff too that, um, you always think that a lot of business deals, "Well, you help me out, I'll help you out" is kind a the thing.
R:  Right.  Hello, are you there?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I'm getting kind of a echo [LAUGH] here.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I see.  [inaudible].
L:  So I think a lot a -- nowadays it's kind a like, "Well, I'll help you out if you help me out".  
R:  Right.
L:  Especially if it becomes this business situation.
R:  Right.
L:  And so a lot of stuff is shuffled under the boards, so to speak.  And so -- and -- and people vouch for other people and give up a lot of their morals.  
R:  Right.  For the dollar?
L:  Um.  Yeah.  
R:  That's really -- does that really just kind a come down to the dollar?
L:  I hate to say it but I think ... [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  There's [MN] -- there --
R:  I just wanted to make verify and --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- make sure ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  There's a quote when they say it's -- it's -- it's [several inaudible words], it's not the dollar.  It's the dollar.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Wow.  [LAUGH] 
L:  So I think of that quote.  I don't know who said that but ...  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Right.  Right.  That's pretty cool.  That's kind a cute.  [LAUGH]  Wow.  But I'll do -- do you know if -- do you have any friends that -- well, I'm trying to think of friends that, you know, that I know that do that.  I mean, how can you sleep at night?  Or do you just drink it away or -- I don't know.  I mean, uh, do you just build a -- a callousness and you -- and it doesn't bother you or ...?  I don't get it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, I think they're so used to doing it that -- that it comes to the point that, um, they just do it over and over and think nothing of it then.  
R:  Because it c- -- becomes second nature?
L:  Mhm.
R:  So then I guess when they get caught it is a complete surprise? 
L:  Um ...  I think if somebody is [MN] ...  I think so, because I think, like, anything you do in life is you do it over and over again.
R:  Over and o- -- mhm.
L:  It becomes a routine.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so then if you ask somebody to do something and they say, "Oh, sure" and do it over again.  Then you come across somebody and you need their help --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- and they say, "No.  This is morally wrong".  And you're like, well, "Oh, no.  It's like -- I've -- I've done it before".  
R:  Right.
L:  And then they're sitting there and -- and then they're -- you almost get mad at that person probably because they're like, heck what is this person doing?  You know, it's like everybody else has vouched for me now this person won't.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And ...
R:  And you missed the point?
L:  Mhm.
R:  The person misses the real point behind it?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Wow.  Mm.  Um, I guess it can be done.  I guess if -- if -- if you're put in circumstances, uh, that you consider crucial enough or detrimental enough or maybe -- m- maybe you feel, um, desperate.
L:  I think too, it's kind a like if you take a -- somebody who's very wealthy or rich.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And they probably have no clue of somebody who's working for, a, no minimum wage or something.
R:  Right.
L:  And can't comprehend that the other person's struggling to get ahead or struggling to pay their bills.  
R:  Right.
L:  It's a kind of comparison there.  Almost an analogy that you don't have reco- recognition that what it -- how somebody else lives and that somebody [MN] does not have off as good as you.  Likewise, if you're asking somebody the -- to commit perjury you probably -- and you've done it before ...  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  You're in another lifestyle, let's say, [MN] um, "I want you to -- to do this.  Why won't you do it for me now?"
R:  Mm.
