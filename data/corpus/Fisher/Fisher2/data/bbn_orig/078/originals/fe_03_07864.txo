R:  Hi.  My name is Elizabeth and I'm in New York.
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] I could te- -- I would have guessed that by the accent.
R:  [MN] Yes. [LAUGH]
L:  The way you have your R.'s, you say, you know, New York. [NOISE]
R:  [MN] Hello?
L:  Yes.
R:  The way I said, New York?
L:  Yeah, New York. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]
L:  And you probably say coffee.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I was hoping I'd get somebody from New York.
R:  Yes, I like this, too.  Talking far away, yeah.
L:  Isn't that cool? [NOISE]
R:  Yes.  This is far out.
L:  I know it. [LAUGH] And I was hoping like tonight it was something I could talk about 'cause I've done that for a year, owned my own business, you know, a small business --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, um, [MN] it's not --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [MN] it's kind of, like, not realistic [MN], you know, 'cause they say, "If money's no object", well if money's no object it would be really easy.
R:  Yes, it will.
L:  'Cause part of the problem was [COUGH] money was always an object [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.  That's [inaudible] to get your own business.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, because you have to pay for everything.
R:  That's true.  And you have to start off in the bottom until you can, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [MN] hopefully you get somebody who had investors.
L:  [MN] I know it.  And [MN], you know, every mistake is costing you money [NOISE] and you don't realise that, you know, everything is your responsibility and the bills are coming in.
R:  [MN] Well, it's -- it's a thing they say, "It's a chance that you take, is what your dream is" [MN] and if you want --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- to be your own businessman you're gonna -- it's gonna be a lot of downs before you start living it up.
L:  [MN] You know, and I believe that.
R:  [MN] And how long you been in business?
L:  [MN] Well, um, I was in business only for a year.
R:  What type of business?
L:  Counseling.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You're private?
L:  [MN] Um, [MN] uh, counseling, uh -- [COUGH] [MN] uh, all kinds of clients, private clients --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and, um, it was [MN], uh, I really liked it but [MN] you also [MN], you know, you had to always remember it was a business.
R:  True.  And --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you had to make sure that you be funded back in return because, uh, everybody don't always have cash in their pockets.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, and then, [MN] if clients are --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- getting behind in paying you, you know, the bills are still coming in, you still have to have the lights on.
R:  That's right.
L:  You know?
R:  And the --
L:  And the --
R:  -- you gotta still have the sofa for them to come --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- sit on. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, you gotta --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you gotta have that sofa.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And you gotta pay the rent.
R:  That's right.  That's the nu- -- that's the number one thing.
L:  Yes.
R:  But, you know what, don't give up your dream.  If that's what you like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to do, yeah, you -- you learn from your -- you learn from the -- the bad and you learn from what you did and hopefully you won't do that again.
L:  Totally.
R:  Yes, you know?  But --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [MN] dream always, I wanted to open up my own baby shop.
L:  Really?
R:  [MN] Yes.  And I want it to be Rattle Columbus Avenue on Eighty Sixth Street.
L:  So, which -- what does that mean?
R:  Well, right now, is -- everything is booked on Eighty Sixth Street --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- [MN] and I went into another direction.  I -- I thought of -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [MN] how you say, "Working for other people".
L:  Right, right, right.
R:  [MN] Um, right now I work for M.C.U. I work for the Municipal Credit Union --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- where --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I'm in the loan department and I is, um, and we deal with a lot of order loans --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and, uh, I would just been +asking a lot of questions because, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- now today, you know what, people have -- don't have such a perfect, um, driving record --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you know, a lot of tickets and you know how they're giving tickets like crazy in New York?
L:  Yes.
R:  [MN] I was looking at possibly of going into insurance.
L:  Okay.
R:  [MN] And, um, that's something that I have to definitely go back --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to school for but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [MN] something to offer the company.  Because we have no insurance to give our members.
L:  Okay.
R:  [MN] And that sound like a business plan for me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  So, that's something, you know, I wanna, you know, really put my heart to because I come a long way [MN] of doing so many -- how you say, a Jack of all trades and a master of none?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, right now --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think I'm kinda set -- I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I enjoy what I'm doing right now it's just that I need to have more input, I need to get creative.
L:  [NOISE] [MN] Yes!
R:  Very creative.  And that's the one thing about business, you have to be creative.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, yes.
R:  And you have to be challenges and you have to put up them boxing gloves --
L:  [MN] Yes.
R:  -- [MN] and go in it.
L:  [MN] Yes.
R:  Yes. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's really -- it's really not easy, you know?  Especially if you're young, you know?  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You have these old timers -- that's who we learn from, the old timers --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because they'll --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- they'll tell you definitely of their ups and their downs [MN] and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and what -- what -- how they fall, how many times they must have -- threw the rag in.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And how many times they picked up the rag and said, "I ain't gonna let this happen to me".
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, you got to really believe. [NOISE] 
L:  [MN]
R:  You know?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Gotta really believe.
L:  Yes. [NOISE]
R:  So, what you doing for yourself now?
L:  [MN] Um, [MN] working for other people. [MN] The same kind of stuff but for [MN], um, working for agencies and I don't have to -- the good thing is I don't have to worry if the bills are paid for the --
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  -- agency, you know? [NOISE]
R:  But do you still do your little private duty on the side?
L:  [NOISE] I'm gonna go back to it.
R:  Yeah, that's -- that could be a little special income.  That way you don't have to [MN] balance your whole life around that.
L:  [NOISE] [MN] You know, even if it's one day a week, I wanna -- 'cause I do miss it.
R:  Yes.
L:  [MN]
R:  [MN] And I know a lot of the clients must miss you, too.
L:  Well, you get -- well, some of them you get a bond.
R:  Yes, but then you got to remember --
L:  I kno- --
R:  -- it's a job.
L:  [MN] Exactly!
R:  You give what you can give and remember when the clock ends --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that's it. [LAUGH]
L:  And you -- it's something you always have to remember.
R:  Yeah, that's true.  And it's, um, [MN] especially if you're very [MN] -- if you are [MN] -- see, in that type of field, you have to be very, I don't know how to put the word to it [inaudible] -- 'cause I used to go see a counselor --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- you know, I was going through issues --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and [MN] -- and all kinds of problems with myself --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [MN] I a single woman, no husband, no --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- children [MN] --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and of course, we get lead astray and we do wild things --
L:  [MN] Yes.
R:  -- and, um, and I needed somebody to really talk to because --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. 
R:  -- I felt I was holding --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a lot of stuff in.
L:  Okay.
R:  And, um, I wasn't talking to my family, I was putting on a -- you know, I was putting on this different type of person --
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  -- [MN] and it wasn't really being myself.
L:  Yes.
R:  [MN] But, um, I turned a lot of things over to God --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and I just told him please just enlighten me so I started with therapy --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and after therapy I started having my private counselor.
L:  All right.
R:  And then -- and the, hey, I'm find today, you know?
L:  Good.
R:  I'm living on life's terms.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, you sound real happy and like you're a real positive person.
R:  I -- it took a long way to get --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- this way, my friend.
L:  Really?
R:  Yes. [MN] I --
L:  [MN] [NOISE]
R:  -- yeah, I be forty seven this year and let me tell you about most of my life I've been just really nutting up, doing what I wanted to do --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- not what I'm supposed to do.
L:  [MN] Right, I hear that.
R:  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  We all get le- lead astray but time is -- is not waiting for anyone and -- and tomorrow is not promised.
L:  [MN] You know, you're right.
R:  Yeah, so [MN] go for it. 
L:  [MN] Y- --
R:  You know?  Go for what your -- what your dreams are and like I say, you learn from your mistakes.
L:  [MN] Boy, that is true.
R:  And you really didn't mistakes it's just that somethings you just -- like I said that job is a very delicate type of job.
L:  Yes.
R:  'Cause like you say, you're dealing with sick people and you don't want to cut somebody off but you have to put yourself in that state of mind, [MN] business is business.
L:  [MN] Ye- --
R:  [MN] And if you start off very slowly --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and build yourself a couple of clients --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you'll be all right.
L:  Yeah, 'cause it's been on my mind a lot. [NOISE]
R:  [MN] Yeah, well go for it.  Don't let it just sit there on your mind.
L:  [MN] I think where you live you have so many opportunities and so many options and [NOISE] you know, in New York, I've never been there, just sounds [MN] wonderful and nuts at the same time.
R:  Honey, we are congested here. [LAUGH]
L:  Really?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Hot and crowded, aren't ya?
R:  Oh my God!  We have --

L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and things that goes on here in New York.
L:  [MN] Yeah?
R:  Um, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- sometime it's -- it's a happy day, sometime it's scary days, [MN] sometimes, um, you know, 'cause I was r- -- I was right down there by nine eleven --
L:  Really?
R:  Um, yeah, that's where I'm based right now.  Um, my job is back where it's at, at M.C.U.

L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, you know, they're not gonna hit the same place again because there's nothing to hit --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but it's just that, um, it's -- it's -- we are -- we are going through changes here in New York.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  We don't know what's gonna happen next so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we just leave it in God's hand.
L:  Wow.
R:  That they get a hold of these people and -- and -- and just put them in the right state of mind.
L:  [MN]
R:  [MN] Not punish them, just put them in the right state of mind and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- leave it in God's hand.
L:  [MN] You're the only one I've ever talked to who was right in that area.
R:  Yes, and I'm back in there again.
L:  [MN] Were you a little, uh, nervous or, you know, or --
R:  Oh, yes, you know?  But, you know, I had to, like I said, God showed me a lot of things that, um, that has been done and things that I have done and things a lot of people had done and we just have to believe in him.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just give -- give strength everyday that this don't happen to us again.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [MN] This always takes me back to Noah, in the bible --
L:  Good point.
R:  -- how you, you know, what happened to the [MN] -- you know, that God made the rain so many days --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [MN] of destroying his land and, you know, there's the evil people and stuff [MN] and it wasn't really meant for us.  You know what I'm saying, it wasn't really meant. [NOISE] But due to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, you have a lot of people out here that's into politics and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and -- and nations and all kinds of crazy stuff is going on so [MN] we don't know, we're just people here trying to make a day living and not knowing what's going on with the poli- political world.
