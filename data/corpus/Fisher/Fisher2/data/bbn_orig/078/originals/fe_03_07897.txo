R:  Hello.
L:  Ni- -- hello.
R:  Yeah, hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  My name is Prankul.  That's a little hard.  It's P.R.A.N.K.U.L.
L:  Okay.  Um, now if -- if you're offered one million dollars and you had to give up your best friend would you take the one million dollars and go and give up your best friend?
R:  [LAUGH] That's a tough question, isn't it?  What's your name?  I'm sorry.  I didn't get your name.
L:  It's Susan.
R:  Susan, okay.  Hi, Susan.
L:  Hi.
R:  Okay.  Um, don't know what to tell you.  I mean, uh, I would probably not take --
L:  Just give me a hypothetical situation.
R:  Yeah, I would say, uh, I would not take it.
L:  Okay.
R:  How about you?
L:  I don't know.  I'm asking you the question.  Hold on.
R:  I'm sorry.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello.
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, what were you saying?
L:  [NOISE] Okay.  So, hypothetical situation, would you give up your best friend?
R:  Right, I guess we are --
L:  Yeah, yeah, like a scenario.
R:  -- we are supposed to discuss, like, each other's, uh, thoughts about this.
L:  Okay.  Well, I wouldn't give my best friend up [NOISE].  I a- -- doesn't matter what type of or how much money that a person could offer me --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- if it -- when it comes to my best friend in the whole wide world --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they'd do anything for me I would never ever give that up.
R:  Sure, yeah.  I agree with you there.  I mean, I -- I guess money is, like, it's going to get over one day or the other, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, but friendships --
L:  [NOISE] If you think about it you can, like [NOISE], spend a million dollars in one day.
R:  Oh, yeah, absolutely, absolutely.  I agree, like, I mean, you cannot save it up forever but it's going to be gone, like, if -- and especially in this case because you just got it, like, s- out of the blue.  You're going to spend it so quick that you wouldn't even know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so, and then once they're gone you will be left, like, "Oh, my god, I lost everything", sort of thing.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, you lost the money and you lost your friend --
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  -- so that, yeah, I mean --
L:  So, in the end you've really basically --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- really have nothing.
R:  Sure, yeah.
L:  So --
R:  That's -- that's what I'm saying, like, 'cause -- 'cause money is just so, you know, it comes and goes so easily, like, one day you have it and the other day you don't, like, it's -- it's gone, like, [MN] in a w- --
L:  From one moment to the next --
R:  Yeah, abs- -- exactly.
L:  -- and everyone is out to win a buck.
R:  That's right, yeah.
L:  So, if -- if you were to -- if you were to give up your entire life style with your best friend --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- hypothetically it would not be worth it.
R:  Not at all.  I agree there.  I agree with you completely.
L:  Sorry, are we supposed to -- supposed to talk for ten minutes about this?
R:  Yeah, yeah, I guess so.  I guess we -- that's -- I -- this -- is this your first call?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, okay.  Yeah, your s- -- this is my third.  Yeah, uh, I think you're supposed to talk for ten minutes.
L:  I see.
R:  What -- what do you do?
L:  What do I do?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Well, I'm about to get married and, um, I have four children [NOISE] --
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  -- so, what part of the country are you calling from?
R:  I'm in Delaware, and you?
L:  I'm in, um, Salem, Oregon.
R:  Oh, okay, Oregon, wow.  That's a neat place.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I've been to Oregon once.  I've been to Portland, that area.
L:  Uh-huh.  Portland's real busy.
R:  Yeah, it's -- it's so pretty out there.
L:  But hypothetically you should take a million dollars and go into Portland --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and it would be like history because you could go out and buy beach property --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and you could buy, you know, it -- land --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it'd be gone like that.  One bill and it'd be history.
R:  Yeah, yeah, that's tr- -- I mean, a million dollars go a lot -- go a long way if you want to but I know -- I know, like, if you just -- if -- if somehow you just w- -- get it you -- they're not going to go a long way.  They just going to be gone --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- because you are, like, "Oh, yeah, I didn't really work for it so I can do whatever I want to" and then the next day you realise it all over --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, yeah.
L:  I see.
R:  Definitely means --
L:  So, do you stay on this line for ten minutes and then you go to the next caller?
R:  No.  You can only do one s- -- one call in a day.
L:  In a day?
R:  Yes because the topic stays the same.
L:  Oh, it stays in the same?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, it's -- it's one topic per day.
L:  And so basically it -- you have one caller [NOISE] a day --
R:  That's correct.
L:  -- and then -- and then they add -- in three weeks they send you a cheque?
R:  I think so.  I mean --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- I guess so.
L:  Hmm.  So what is the weather up there like in Delaware?
R:  Oh, it's starting to get hot now.  It has been [NOISE] rain.  I mean, it has been, like, it rained a lot in [NOISE] May then started getting nice now it's, I mean, the last couple of days have been --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- very hot [NOISE].
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] I see.  All for that they have interesting topics, uh, yeah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- each day?
R:  Uh, yes, that's correct.
L:  So, if you have, like, a scenario of, like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, like, if you were given a million dollar cheque --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you just stick it in the bank and you could, like, live off the interest alone --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and basically retire if you played -- played the cards right.
R:  Mm.  Yeah, [NOISE] but I d- I d- -- [NOISE] I think again, like, I don't think money is -- is worth, uh, much more than people 'cause --
L:  Friendship and family --
R:  Yeah, exactly.  I mean --
L:  -- and relationships.
R:  Yeah, and -- 'cause -- 'cause it's so, I mean [NOISE], that's what life is all about, building relationships.  It's a money, like, I mean, once you [NOISE] I mean, I've seen it [NOISE] zillion time, like, once -- once you start to make money your god, you know, m- --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- just admire money, like, you forget about everything then, you know, in the end you'll lose everything.  You'll have nobody left with you.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, that's -- I mean, it's -- it's so tempting, like, a million dollars, that's -- I cannot even ima- -- like, you know, y- -- it's [NOISE] hard to dream making that much money in your whole life, right?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Like [MN], I mean, a million dollars and you're getting it, like, [NOISE] without doing anything pretty much --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but -- but then, yeah, you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but then once you're into that, like, I guess --
L:  Mhm [NOISE].
R:  -- like, you just [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you just bound to lose everything.
L:  Mhm [NOISE].
R:  That's what I think.
L:  Uh-huh.  Well, I have a -- I have a twelve year old, well, she's eleven year old body that's like [NOISE] kind of like kept puberty [LAUGH] [NOISE].
R:  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH] She's, like, giving everybody a bad time [NOISE] today.
R:  Oh, okay [LAUGH].
L:  [NOISE] So, well, anyway [NOISE] --
R:  So, you have two boys, two girls or something like that?
L:  [NOISE] I -- I have -- I have three boys [NOISE].  I have [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] Well, anyway, do -- so, do you have to stay on here for, like, ten minutes?
R:  [NOISE] Yes.
L:  [NOISE] Come to see.
R:  Uh --
L:  Have we been on here for --
R:  I think we're almost done [NOISE], like --
L:  Are we?
R:  I think so.  Mm [NOISE], so -- so, anyhow, like, the -- I mean, I guess we [MN] pretty much agreed on what our views about the topic [NOISE].
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  Do you work --?
L:  So --
R:  -- or do you stay at home?
L:  I stay at home [NOISE].
R:  Yeah, you have to with four kids.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Uh-huh [NOISE].
R:  I said you have to with four kids.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, right now --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I have one that's, like, real unruly [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I can hear that [MN] [NOISE].
L:  She likes to give everybody a hard time.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I think it's the age.
R:  [NOISE] That's true.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  It's just basically the age --
R:  Yeah [NOISE].
L:  -- so, it's like, um [NOISE], it's interesting.
R:  [NOISE] Now, would you, I mean, it's a personal question but would you [NOISE] consider yourself, like, you know, just a r- rich or comfortable or, you know, like, I don't know [MN]?
L:  Oh, I don't know.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I guess we're comfortable for the most part.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I mean, I guess that's -- that's all you really [NOISE] care for.  Like, you, I mean, you have a roof over your -- your head and [NOISE] food in your fridge and, you know, you have your family and friends with you and [NOISE] you don't -- you don't really want to get any more, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, you don't want to give it up for some high flying life [NOISE], uh, in which you don't talk to your friends and stuff [NOISE].
L:  Yeah.  I have all my friends and most of my family is in Salt Lake City.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, re- -- oh, you j- -- did you move recently?
L:  [NOISE] We moved here to Oregon in -- in last August so we've been almost here for almost a year.
R:  Okay, but not too long.
L:  Mm.
R:  Did -- was that due to a job transfer [NOISE]?
L:  Huh, no, actually I came up here.  I'm getting married.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh [NOISE].
L:  So --
R:  Okay.  Well, pretty soon?
L:  Um, next Thursday, a week from t- --
