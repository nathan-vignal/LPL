R:  [NOISE] Hi, it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Wayne calling from --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Milwaukee.
L:  [NOISE] Hi, Wayne.  My name is Devora.  I'm in New York City. [NOISE]
R:  And how are you doing this afternoon? [MN]
L:  [MN] I'm actually fine, although I'm trying to scribble down the questions that --
R:  I know. [MN]
L:  -- they said. 
R:  [MN]
L:  [MN] What type of business, how suc- -- I don't know, I don't -- didn't really get it all.  It was kind of too many words, so ... [NOISE]
R:  [MN] Oh, no problem at all. [MN] Well, anyways, I have some experience with this. [MN]
L:  Oh, you do?
R:  Yes.  Um --
L:  Tell my about it.
R:  [LIPSMACK] I have actually s- -- um, started a business of my own.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I've been running it for almost a year now and have --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- quite a bit ex- experience on what to do, what not to do [MN] --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- and everything else. [MN]
L:  Well, I want to hear all this 'cause I want to start my own business.  Wh- -- uh, [MN] what -- what is your business?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, I have a speed dating franchise.
L:  Speed [LAUGH] dating franchise.
R:  Mhm. [MN]
L:  [MN] Well, that something I'm not gonna do.  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, essentially, um, [MN] I started this, um, you know, [MN] following the craze --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of everybody trying to meet other people in various ways.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And saw an opportunity in this market.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [MN] So, I went about contacting a firm, [NOISE] uh, buying the rights for this area --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and then basically started building it up from there.
L:  So, it's kind of a franchise?
R:  Yes.
L:  [MN] And do people actually meet in person or is this a telephone kind of thing?
R:  They meet in person.
L:  Huh.  And everybody talks to each other for thirty seconds or three minutes or whatever it is?
R:  Exactly.  Three minutes, four minutes or, you know, [MN] there's no rhyme or reason as for the set amount of time that you would talk to --
L:  H- how are --
R:  -- another person.
L:  -- they, I mean, I know this isn't a business question, but how are they, uh, working out in terms of matching up?  Have people successfully made --
R:  Most --
L:  -- couples?
R:  Yeah, most people actually do meet at least one or two other people that they [MN] want to get to know better.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And we tell them that, you know, essentially if it's somebody that you might want to get to know put down, "Yes" because what's the worst that can happen?  You just dump them later.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And [LAUGH] --
L:  That could be harder than you think, believe it or not.
R:  I know.
L:  I have experience in this area [LAUGH] pretty recently, but okay. [MN]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um --
R:  [MN] But, um, nevertheless, um, it's proven to be challenging yet exciting.
L:  For you, as a business owner?
R:  Yes.  And --
L:  And -- and -- and do you -- the questions were, um, well we already answered what type of business and how --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you would go about, you explained that you contacted this company and started a franchise, [MN] and do you think you would be successful?  So, do you feel that you are successful at this business?
R:  Yes and no.
L:  Yes and no?
R:  [COUGH] Mhm.
L:  Please explain.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And the reason for it is, I think I was a little too optimistic going into this --
L:  About the money?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yes.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Because I thought it was gonna cost me lots and it has.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I thought I was gonna make more than I have.
L:  Oh.  But have you made enough to keep -- keep on keeping on?
R:  Yes. [NOISE]
L:  And have you made enough to live on?
R:  No. [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] Oh, and have you --
R:  [MN] So, this is something I do on the side.
L:  Oh, so you've -- it's like a s- -- ah, so you have like a day job?
R:  Yes.
L:  [NOISE] What do you do --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for your day job?
R:  I'm a college professor.
L:  At what?
R:  Um, at a small [inaudible] college here in Milwaukee.
L:  N- no I mean in what topic?
R:  Oh, um, economics and accounting.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, if anyone should know better about starting a business it should be myself.
L:  [MN] Well, I think I -- I have a -- I have a friend who divorced and is, I think as of, like, you know, this weekend her divorce is final from an actor and she said she wants to get involved with an entrepreneur 'cause they'd have all this time to be at home with her.  And I said --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- "You haven't met any entrepreneurs" you know, [MN] because they're never home, they spend all their time in the business 'cause it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- up to them whether it sinks or falls, you know?
R:  Exactly.
L:  So --
R:  And that's the thing, I don't think a lot of people understand that it takes a lot of time for any kind of business you want to start.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um [MN] --
L:  [MN] Well, I guess I should answer this too, because they did say --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that we have to stay on the topic, right?
R:  Yup.
L:  So, if we don't [MN] ... Um, I -- I want to [MN] do workshops and travel.  Like, not travel far and wide but, like, you know, within a few states and, uh, give, like, seminars and workshops.
R:  Okay.
L:  [MN] And, uh, [MN] I c- -- I'm very good at the public speaking part of it, I'm very good at the, you know, working the group together and being inspiring [NOISE] and all that kind of good stuff. [MN] Uh, the stuff that you teach is the kind of stuff that I probably need to know, you know?  I know nothing, I mean, I'm not a debtor or anything.  I'm pretty close with money but, um -- or careful, you might say. [MN] But I don't -- there's all kinds of things you need to know about starting -- it's a business and you have to make arrangements and you have to make confirmations and there's a whole lot of administrative detail and God only knows what the tax situation is and [MN] I know nothing about all that stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, that's the first part I want to do is just -- is that, and how well [MN] -- for four and a half years I was an unpaid [LAUGH] -- the unpaid, this is very important, mainstay of the support group for people wh- [MN] -- originally about clutter. [MN] Um --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- but it became kind of a, um, deeper thing, you know, your -- became spiritual clutter, emotional clutter, you name it, you know?  So, [MN] it was really a -- an -- a big support for each of the people in the group and I wrote the format and I wrote the business format and I trained everybody to do this and that and the other thing and I gave speeches and I did all that kind of stuff.  And then I separated from them in December [MN] after having overdone a certain amount of stuff and I realized that, uh, or I'm trying to realize that first of all, if I'm that passionate about this I should be doing this in lots of places --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I should be paid [NOISE] because I was doing way too much work. [NOISE] [MN] So, um, uh, but it's been very strange not having that because it was kind of an outlet.  It's just a -- [MN] I [MN] -- my own clutter was ex- -- was accumulating because I was working so hard on this other thing and not getting recompense. [NOISE] [MN] So, uh, I don't know where I was going with that.  Would I be successful? [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, that depends how you define successful.  It's a litte noisy here, this woman just came right at my shoulder and is talking at the top of her lungs.  Um --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- [MN] [NOISE] I -- I'm sure I would be successful in, as I say, the sort of, um, the liberal arts stage of it, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  The soft phase of it.  I know -- I -- I -- I know from experience that people are -- in fact, I -- I just got a call [MN] about a week or so ago from a woman who I [NOISE] left a phone message for, like, three years ago about this topic.  She had called me [MN] and kind of wanted to meet me in a -- in, you know, a restaurant and I think she just wanted my personal free, you know, clutter training and I called her back and apparently told her a whole bunch of stuff [MN] including the fact that I wouldn't do that. [MN]
R:  Okay.
L:  And she called me three years later and said, "I don't know if you remember me but [MN] you left me this amazing message about the process and it's just been so meaningful to me and I just want to see how you are and get in touch with you and ..." [MN] so I left a very simple thank you for calling message and she called back and read me verbatim every word I had said. [LAUGH] An en- --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- and encore, [MN] you know, that she had written down.  And, uh, she said, "You said that, girl" and I thought --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- "Well, I guess I am inspiring these people" [LAUGH] you know? [MN]
R:  [MN]
L:  So, I know I would be successful with that.  As far as the coordination of all the bits and pieces of it, that would be much more of a challenge.
R:  Okay.
L:  Much more of a challenge. [MN] And I also don't have any [MN] real idea at this point of how [MN] I would, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- get the business going, you know what I mean, I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- y- you know, you could contact [MN] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you could, like, take a category like synagogues in five states and write to them, you know, and that kind of thing.  Or, like wr- --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [NOISE] I don't know what they call them --learning -- they call it, like, a learning annex in New York, these kind of learning centers --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- where you have weekend courses and try and get some kind of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [MN] website for that.  Um --
R:  Well, I think that's part of it, too.  Is that there is a lot of exploration you need to do [MN], um, [LIPSMACK] be it books, be it Internet research, [MN] um, a whole lot of different ways and also the business research itself. [MN] Figuring out what kind of company that I want to establish, how do I go about establishing it? [NOISE] And then, how do I go about running it?
L:  [MN] Now, I would bet that you -- if you hang in there within, like, two years this starting to -- you're gonna start to see the kind of, you know, payback that you were expecting, don't you --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- think?  Yes, you think so too, right?
R:  Yeah, I think so. [MN] And that's the thing.  I think a lot of people [MN] if they don't see success right away --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they figure they failed at it and why bother going forward with it?
L:  [MN] Yeah.  Yeah. [MN] And that's i- --  that's -- that's very interesting.  This -- thi- this woman said that I had given her this process oriented message and I have been noticing the process in other things where [MN] it seems like you failed but in fact you succeed in this leg of a thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, it's not like you, you know, like if you say, "Oh, I --" [MN] if, like, if you're making a cake and you [MN] crack the eggs and measure the sugar, you don't say, "Oh, my God, I don't have a cake.  I failed" and you throw it all out.  I mean, you successfully measured [MN], [LAUGH] you know, open the eggs and measured the sugar, you just have some more parts to do to make the whole cake, you know?
R:  Yup.
L:  [MN] So, anyway, I think that's true. [MN] The other thing that actually I have in mind, there's two things I have in mind, the other one is being a life coach. [MN] And I actually have a story that goes with that which I guess might be apropos because [MN] there was a woman in the group that I used to, you know, be so involved with. [MN] She was new and she was sitting next to me and so at the end I turned to her and was -- said something friendly and she got very attached and she wanted to know would I, like, sponsor her and I said, "Well, we don't do that.  We just do, like, a mutual thing.  Like a buddy thing" so I would do a fifty fifty thing with you, it's a long story of how I got to that point --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- it took some -- a while but I said that. [MN] And so we're supposed to do this fifty fifty thing which, you know, immediately became a hundred and ten percent to negative numbers and, you know, wherever I would -- I would say, "Don't, you know, I'm not available before five" and so she'd call at three and she would be crisis and in pain so I would talk to her and then she would call at one and then she would, you know, have her boyfriend problem at eight in the morning and [MN] --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- so it was -- it was torturous and I became more and more upset with the whole thing.  I mean, I, you know, I --
