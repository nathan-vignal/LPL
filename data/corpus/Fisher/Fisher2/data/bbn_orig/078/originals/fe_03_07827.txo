R:  Hello.
L:  Hello, my name's Mike.
R:  Hi, my name's Maureen.
L:  Hey, Maureen.  How are you?
R:  Good.  How are you?
L:  Good.
R:  Good.  
L:  Where you calling from?
R:  Uh, Maine.  
L:  You're in Maine.  Great.  
R:  Yeah.  Where are you from?
L:  Kansas City.
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH]  We're pretty far apart. 
L:  Yes we are.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  No good seafood here at all.
R:  Yeah.  Well, the weather isn't so hot here yet so ...
L:  Oh, it isn't?
R:  That's our downfall. 
L:  Oh, that's true.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Long winters, huh?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Well, I'd take a million bucks to [LAUGH] leave.  
R:  I would too.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Why not?  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  People live outside the U.S. all the time.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  And they don't have a million dollars.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Exactly.  
L:  I mean, sure, I'd miss it.  I'd miss, you know, I'd miss a whole bunch of it but, my goodness, I'd make it happen.
R:  Sure.  I would as well.  I mean, especially like -- one of the main things I thought of was I would miss my family in the States but if you have a million [LAUGH] dollars you can --
L:  You can easily get 'em to come visit you.
R:  Right.  Exactly.  I mean --
L:  Now, it's just a question of where -- where you'd want to live.
R:  Yeah.  [MN]  Uh, that's the tough one.  [LAUGH] 
L:  That would be a tough one.
R:  Well, with a million dollars you could also live a couple of places, maybe.  I mean, not that a million -- a million dollars isn't -- it's a lot --
L:  It's not that mu- --
R:  It's not that much.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it would get you out and maybe if you could invest it wisely you could [MN] certainly travel on it.
L:  Oh, sure. 
R:  So ...
L:  You could live in Mexico for a million bucks easy.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah. 
L:  For a long time.
R:  That's true.  Depending where you go you could ...  Yeah.  You'd --
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- live a lot different lifestyles.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Where do you think you would go?
L:  Uh --
R:  At least for starters.
L:  I don't know.  I guess, probably, some place warm.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  But it'd be more expensive to live some place warm.  You know, like somewhere in the Caribbean.
R:  Sure.  Some place --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- tropical probably would be more expensive.
L:  Well, if Castro died, Cuba might be the place to live.
R:  That's funny.  My friend and I are just talking.  She might be making -- trying to make a trip to Cuba.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  Some time, so ...  Yeah.  I think Cuba would be a ...
L:  That'd be -- that'd be great. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think as soon as he dies it's -- that -- that country's gonna change.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It'll be totally different.
R:  Yeah, depending on how the U.S. reacts to [LAUGH] whatever --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the next, uh, leader --
L:  Dictator.
R:  -- there is, though.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  That always makes a difference.  Yeah, I don't know.  Like I've done a little -- done a little bit of travelling in mostly Western Europe.  Um, and -- but it was so -- you know, anywhere -- lots of different places there could be appealing.  Um, but I don't [MN] -- God with [LAUGH] -- with a million dollars and the [LAUGH] -- the world at your [LAUGH] hands.
L:  No kidding.
R:  There's just so many.
L:  Yeah, wh- when I was in -- I was in Europe it was in December, so it was really cold and nasty.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I didn't really enjoy, uh, being there with -- with the language barrier for me so ...
R:  Sure.
L:  If they -- I mean, I could -- I could speak Spanish enough to pick it up.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But [MN] European languages I'm not very well with, you know.  I don't do very well with that, so ...  But, I mean, I guess I'd probably work i- work it out.  But ...
R:  Yeah, I mean, if you're gonna live abroad and -- unless you're gonna --
L:  I guess London would be all right.
R:  Yeah.  Actually I've been to London too and that was -- that was great.  I would love to go there again.  And [SIGH] ...
L:  I've never been there.  I'd like to go some time.
R:  Yeah.  It's -- I mean, if you like huge cities.  [LAUGH]  If you're not --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- into a huge city, kind of thing.  How -- I don't even know.  How big is Kansas City?
L:  Kansas City's, like, about a million.
R:  Okay.  Yeah, so that's -- that's pretty big.  I lived in Chicago for a couple of years and that's even bigger, of course.  And London --
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  -- I think is probably bigger than Chicago.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
R:  But I'm -- I'm not real positive.
L:  I would guess.
R:  Yeah.  Um, but yeah.  I would -- I didn't go to France so I'd be interested in at least visiting there and seeing if I would like to live somewhere there.  I didn't get to Italy.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And I think Italy would be wonderful as well.
L:  Yeah, I'd like to go to Italy too.  France is okay.  Again, it was a bad time of the year.  I went --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- up in the Eiffel Tower and it was just fog.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You couldn't see --
R:  Couldn't see?
L:  -- anything.  And it was just -- it was nasty.
R:  Yeah.  That's too bad
L:  Nasty cold.  I spent half the day at Hard Rock Cafe.  
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] no.  
L:  In Paris.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh my gosh, the wait was forever and it was just, this is ridiculous.  And I mean why were we -- we ate there.  It was stupid.  
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah. 
L:  I should have ate somewhere --
R:  With all of the French cuisine at your hands.
L:  I know.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I know.  We went to the stupid --
R:  It happens though, man.
L:  -- Hard [LAUGH] Rock Cafe.
R:  It happens.  When I was travelling, like, with all, you know, the places I've been, once I had to go and, you know, I think I stopped in a Burger King and got fries for comfort food.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  You know.
L:  I ate McDonalds --
R:  It happens.
L:  -- when I was in Amsterdam.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, gosh.
R:  I loved -- I loved Amsterdam actually and I wish I'd spent more time there.  
L:  Yeah, it was a neat place.  It really was.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Did you go to Ann Franks' home?
R:  I didn't get to go there.  No.
L:  Oh, it was really neat.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It was --
R:  I -- I really should've spent more time.  It was the first city that I arrived in when I was doing the backpacking thing and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I liked it but I got a little too anxious to, like, hit some more places and I didn't spend enough time.
L:  Oh, you should go back.  
R:  I know.  And, you know, there have been flights.  I read, like, four months ago or something, there was a round trip flight from anywhere in the east coast to Amsterdam.  Two hundred and --
L:  Oh, God.
R:  -- forty eight dollars.
L:  No kidding?
R:  Yeah.  I mean, that's just -- that's [LAUGH] ridiculously cheap.
L:  It is ridiculous.
R:  So, I mean, that's cheaper than if I flew out to the west coast here.  So ...
L:  From here to, like, Florida is, like, two hundred, uh, two hundred and fifty dollars so ...
R:  Right.
L:  Well from here to just about anywhere.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]  The great thing about be- -- living in the mid west though is I can get anywhere.
R:  Yeah, you're in the middle.
L:  Pret- pretty much.
R:  I'm from the mid west.  I'm from Ohio so I --
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, you'd know.  You're familiar then.
R:  Originally, and then Chicago a little bit.  And I just moved out here to Maine, like, three weeks ago, [LAUGH] so ...
L:  Oh, really?  So new to Maine, huh?
R:  Yeah, very new.  Very new.  
L:  Well, good deal.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know.
L:  All right, so we both take the million bucks.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, we do it.  
L:  Together we'd have two million.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Sure.
L:  We could definitely make it happen for that.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  Um, mm, what was I gonna say?  Oh, would you -- what would you miss if you left for good?
L:  I'd miss -- I mean, I guess I'd miss a whole bunch of it.  I'd have to go to Puerto Rico to watch baseball, I guess.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Or go up to Canada.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'd miss baseball just a ton.  I guess they have N.F.L. Europe now.  I mean, I'd miss N.F.- the N.F.L. a little but I love baseball.  I don't know why, it's just something that's gotten into my blood and I just ...
R:  Sure.
L:  -- have always loved going to the games and just sitting there w- -- it's -- it's kind of laid back.  It's not, like, high intense like hockey.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or basketball where, you know, everything's moving.  It's just -- you kind of really have to follow it and know it.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah, you'd definitely have to -- to fish -- 
L:  What would you miss?
R:  -- around for that.  [LAUGH]  What would I miss?  Um, [SIGH] uh, the main thing I think would be just, you know, friends and family that would be far away.  'Course depending how far away I went, you know.  [LAUGH]  If I were Canada [LAUGH] that's not so far.
L:  Yeah, really.
R:  But like we said we could make that work but -- oh, shoot.  I don't know.  I think, just from the travelling that I did [MN] [SIGH] I don't know, you just -- you [MN] -- it's really amazing.  No matter how much -- how open you are to other cultures, other experiences, you really realize when you're outside of it, and you don't speak the language of where you are, and you are only familiar with the customs through any reading that you've done, you know.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  You just really realize how ingrained your own culture and your own customs and your own every little thing is and it gets really -- it's really stressful --
L:  Oh, I agree.
R:  -- and frustrating to try to, uh, [MN] just on a -- you know, anything from crossing the street.  And, of course, you know, if you're living some place where you, uh, didn't speak the language you'd learn it eventually [LAUGH].  I would eventually.
L:  Sure.
R:  I certainly --
L:  Yeah, def- --
R:  -- wouldn't want to be trying to make everyone speak English verbs because I don't speak their language and I'm living in their country.  So, you know, eventually you'd learn it and all those things would become, you know, second nature.  But I think that that transition would be --
L:  Yeah, definitely --
R:  -- would be difficult.
L:  -- the -- the comfort of ...  I wanna -- wanna say the word comfort because it's just been, you know, like you said, you been growing -- growing up in it.  E- everything around you you're -- you're familiar with it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  That you understand how things work in the U.S. I guess.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just understanding those [LAUGH] basics.  Just figuring out how, I mean, anything from, like, how to get some -- the foods that you want.  Like trying to buy -- just trying to buy like yogurt in a store in, uh, like in Belgium.  Like I didn't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- know if I was buying yogurt, like Danan[?] yogurt or [LAUGH] I was --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- buying some [LAUGH] kind of unsweetened --
L:  Frozen.
R:  Some other kind of, I don't even know what, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that's a language barrier thing again too.  But just learning anything as simple as that to, I don't know, figuring out how to get, I don't know.  If you -- employment 'cause that million dollars wouldn't last forever. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, you got taxes and ...
R:  Yeah.  Employment taxes.
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  Health care.  
L:  Oh, health care.  Yeah.  
R:  So just making that --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- transition would be -- would be really a lot of work, but I think that it would be worth it if you decided that's what you wanted to do and you're --
L:  Oh--
R:  -- getting the -- the money then [LAUGH] it'd be worth it for me.
L:  Heck, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I mean, [MN] I had to think about it for a second and I'm like, well people live outside the U.S. all the time.
R:  Yeah, my --
L:  And they don't have a million dollars.
R:  Yeah, my best -- my best friend lived outside the U.S. for two years until recently.  Travelled and lived in the Philippines and lived in Hungary and --
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.  You can definitely do it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, you --
L:  For sure.
R:  -- can do it on -- I mean she didn't have no money but you can do it on somewhat of a budget.  So it's possible.
L:  There's a whole big world out there.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mm.
