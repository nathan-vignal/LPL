L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, this is Michele.
L:  Hi, I'm Carol in -- in Los Angeles.
R:  Oh okay, I'm in, uh, Pennsylvania.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Wow.
L:  Ok- -kay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I have to think about this subject now.
R:  Yes.
L:  [COUGH] Well, would you like to start?
R:  Sure.
L:  Okay.
R:  What did it say?  Go back in time and --
L:  In time and --
R:  -- change --
L:  -- change something.
R:  Oh, let's see.
L:  I didn't catch -- they only read it off once, I didn't catch it, it was just one thing?
R:  [MN]
L:  Okay, I could go f- -- go for that.
R:  Well, I -- I don't know if it's just one thing or whether it's many things, I don't know -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't know either.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, what would I change?  Ugh --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Well, let's think, um ... [SIGH] um, probably --
L:  Well -- go ahead.
R:  A, um, [LIPSMACK] probably my education.
L:  Likewi- --
R:  I'd probably choose something other than, uh, nursing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Something other, you know, but I'm not sure what it would be but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of course --
L:  Well, with -- with me it would be my education also.  Mhm.
R:  Pardon?
L:  Would be my education also --
R:  Oh okay.
L:  -- or lack of it.
R:  Oh okay.
L:  I, am, [COUGH] fifty nine and I grew up in a small town, uh, and, uh, also, uh, at that time my -- my parents were, uh, older and they were well in their middle age when they had me.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Uh-huh.
L:  And their attitudes were that education was wasted on a girl.
R:  Okay.
L:  And actually, um, I only completed high school and there was no -- no thought -- although my family they did have enough money at that time to, uh, pay for college, uh --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and they --
R:  But --
L:  -- wouldn't.
R:  But --
L:  I didn't receive a -- a penny from my parents, uh, after I [COUGH] graduated.
R:  [NOISE] Hm.
L:  And, uh, in those days there were no student loans to be had.
R:  [NOISE] Oh okay.
L:  No.
R:  [NOISE] Hm.
L:  No, there were -- there -- there were no student loans.
R:  Right.
L:  There were small scholarships --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like the, uh, DRA in the little town, we'd have a little, you know, like, three hundred dollars or, you know, something, and which was, uh, um, really that kind of scholarship.  Or then there were the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the big national competitions --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- you know, for national, you know, scholars and all that.
R:  Okay.  Okay.
L:  But, uh, that would be the main thing that I would change, would be my education.
R:  Okay.
L:  Because now at my age I'm a widow --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and my husband was very controlling, I -- well that'd be another thing [LAUGH] I'd change! 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  My marriage, yes.  Uh, my husband was a control freak.
R:  Okay.
L:  And I was not allowed to, uh, take the time out to travel to, uh, [COUGH] [LIPSMACK] community college and, uh, and get an education.
R:  Okay.  Did --
L:  All I did was take care of him and the house.
R:  Oh okay.
L:  And now -- now I'm stuck.
R:  Okay, so you were a housewife then, you didn't --
L:  Yes.
R:  You weren't employed --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- outside the home?
L:  Yes, so I've -- I have no --
R:  So you would -- you would pick a career and -- and work.  So you don't --
L:  I have no job --
R:  -- you don't do any --
L:  -- uh, references.  I --
R:  No.
L:  I don't know how to do anything.
R:  Okay.
L:  And here --
R:  But you're okay financially?
L:  No, no I'm not.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  No, not at all.
R:  Ugh.
L:  The social security --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- pension is, uh, [SIGH] well, since this is anonymous, is nine hundred dollars a month.
R:  Oh okay, yeah.
L:  And that -- that's it, and it's -- at -- at age fifty nine and, uh, I have no job skills whatsoever.
R:  Okay. [NOISE] Yeah, then it would be difficult to, uh --
L:  It is difficult.
R:  And then the age factor too --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they take that into consideration too --
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, I'm --
L:  There are all these young -- young --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- uh, girls --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they would choose over me.
R:  Right.
L:  Mm.
R:  Right, yeah. [NOISE]  Absolutely.
L:  So I think education's the main thing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that I would go back and change.
R:  Okay, yeah.  And maybe your husband would've felt differently --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if you were educated?  Do you know, he wouldn't have been so controlling, maybe?
L:  He -- he had a lot of, uh, problems, he was afraid that, uh, that I would, uh, leave him, his --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- first wife had left him, uh --
R:  Oh okay.
L:  -- she was, uh, [LIPSMACK] she was [inaudible], um, he had a PhD and -- and she had -- had a degree also and she left him.
R:  Oh okay.
L:  Uh, so he wanted, uh, [LIPSMACK] someone to just stay home.
R:  Hm.  Yeah.
L:  Ironically at -- when I was, uh, like, in my senior year of high school, I wanted to go to any kind of college, my parents wouldn't pay for it and then I did -- I wanted to go to nursing school because at that time, like I said, I'm fifty nine --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and there were opportunities for girls who didn't have money for college --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in nursing schools.
R:  Right.
L:  And I wanted so much to go to nursing school, my parents wouldn't let me.
R:  Okay.  Yeah. [LIPSMACK]
L:  Because it --
R:  Yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  But now --
L:  See, you're much --
R:  -- that I am a nurse [LAUGH] --
L:  -- younger than I, see things have improved.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You're a lot younger than I and things are better.
R:  Oh yeah, absolutely.  And now it's a two --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- two income family so there's really --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean, I don't know if there's that many men out there that want -- want their women to stay home anymore --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they want 'em to contribute to --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- all the bills and all the [NOISE] things that go with, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  People want things now, you know, they're demanding, you know, they want the best of -- the best of the best.
L:  I can tell you're from Pennsylvania, the way you said, "Go with".
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  That's so familiar to me.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Mm, so --
L:  Yeah, I'm originally from, uh, the east, from Pennsylvania also.
R:  Oh okay.
L:  So I've been in California for, um, forty years.
R:  Wow. [NOISE]
L:  And, uh, I can -- I can still hear the different, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- speech, uh, from Pennsylvania, I recognized it right away.
R:  Where were -- where were you in Pennsylvania?
L:  [MN] [LIPSMACK] Uh, Reading.
R:  Oh okay.  Well I'm in --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- Lititz.
L:  M- oh!
R:  Which is just south.
L:  That -- that's just south --
R:  Yeah.  Just south of --
L:  Yeah, yeah, I know where that is, mhm.
R:  Yeah. [LIPSMACK]  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, I --
R:  Wow. [LAUGH]
L:  So you would really change, you wouldn't be a nurse?
R:  No.
L:  Yeah, I know, it's terrible what they're doing to nurses in the way of salaries.
R:  Well, it's scary nowadays with everything and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, the AIDS and, uh --
L:  Even up in Lititz.
R:  Yep.
L:  My gosh --
R:  Yes, absolutely.
L:  -- I think of that as pristine and --
R:  No.
L:  -- heal- healthy and wholesome.
R:  It's all over.  It's all over.
L:  Oh God.
R:  And it's scary.
L:  It is.
R:  You know, it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You have to really be on your toes all the time and it's -- can be nerve wracking.
L:  You know what?  I talked to my daughter, uh, she wants to make a career change.
R:  [COUGH] Mhm.
L:  She worked for, um, uh, [COUGH] Baxter and maybe, uh, since you're a nurse and you notice all those, um, oh, I think the pumps and different machinery and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- Baxter --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- products.
R:  Okay.
L:  International.  [COUGH]  She's a technical writer.
R:  Oh okay.
L:  And you could get, uh, work -- you could change your career because of your medical knowledge, of terminology.
R:  Okay.
L:  You could, uh, take some course in -- in writing.
R:  Okay.
L:  They need people who write all the protocols, all their instructions.
R:  Oh.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  [inaudible] --
L:  And also I was talking to her, uh, she would be a great, uh, representa- -- a sales representative and if you have medical knowledge, uh, for medical products, what are they called?
R:  [MN]
L:  Detail people?
R:  Yeah, I guess.
L:  Would you like that?
R:  Well, it's something to, you know, look into, yeah, definitely. [NOISE] 
L:  You have to travel a bit and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- with that.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  But boy do they make money.
R:  Wow. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, th- they really --
R:  Well then your daughter is an independent person.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You didn't --
L:  She's not married.
R:  Oh good.  You mean, you didn't, uh --
L:  Mhm, no.
R:  Uh --
L:  No.
R:  -- encourage her to be a stay at home [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, no and I encouraged her to, uh, [SIGH] well, [SIGH] her -- her s- -- her high school was very poor out here, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- at that time -- the schools are so -- public schools are so bad --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  -- that, um, I encouraged her to go to, uh, community college and -- and finish high school.
R:  Okay.
L:  Instead of going to high school through her senior year.
R:  Oh okay, okay.
L:  And then she was able to transfer to u- -- to, uh, UCLA.
R:  Oh, I see, okay.
L:  So it's completely different than -- than my life, so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- if I could go back and change something, hm, [LIPSMACK] it would be education.
R:  Yes.
L:  Because I see the difference in -- in younger women like yourself and my daughter.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Even though you regret your nursing, there's other things that you could do now with that --
R:  [NOISE] Sure.
L:  -- with that medical knowledge.
R:  That's true, that is true.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So [NOISE] -- I shouldn't think I don't have any choices but --
L:  No.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Just think, you could be me!
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] That's true. [NOISE]
L:  That'd be worse.
R:  That's true. [NOISE]  Yes, that's [NOISE] -- well ...
L:  I could just see a younger, uh, women like -- like yourself and my daughter being a wonderful detail person.
R:  Mhm, yes, yeah.  That's something to --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to think about.  It's always good to talk to somebody and get a different point --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of view and -- yep.  So I guess at least some education is better than no education --
L:  You'd better believe it.
R:  -- absolutely, you know, but --
L:  And I always fantasize if I could change something and at least I could've gone to nursing school, maybe I would've met a man who was more, uh, kind than my husband.
R:  [NOISE] Yes.
L:  I wouldn't have had such low self esteem --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- that made me accept him when he asked him to marry him.
R:  Uh-huh, that's true, that's true.  'Cause --
L:  Uh, you know.
R:  -- you know, when you --
L:  And stay with him all those years.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  'Cause when you're --
L:  Because and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I couldn't support, uh, m- my daughter.
R:  No.
L:  With no education.
R:  Right.
L:  What, minimum wage?
R:  Right.
L:  Are you kidding?
R:  Right, no.
L:  So that -- that's why I stayed all those years, was for my daughter.
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  Mm.
R:  So what did he die from?
L:  Uh, he had a series of strokes and --
R:  Oh.
