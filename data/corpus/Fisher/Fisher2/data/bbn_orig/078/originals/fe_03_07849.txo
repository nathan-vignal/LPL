R:  [MN] Hi.  I'm Jessica.
L:  Hi.  Nick. [NOISE]
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, Nick.
L:  Hi.
R:  [NOISE] Um, I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- think I would open, um [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a [MN] copy [MN] store [MN] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- combination --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- espresso cafe.
L:  [NOISE] Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  'Cause I think it's a good combination --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and it's two reasons to draw people in and [MN] people that socialize and get their stuff done and [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, [NOISE] and that's that.
L:  I don't know what I would --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- open.
R:  Well, think about it. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  Um, [MN] I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- don't know.  Some- something that a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- lot of people would be going to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't know.
R:  Like a social deal or a --
L:  Yeah.  But some place where they -- they'd buy s- -- they'd have to buy something that they need.
R:  Hm. [PAUSE]
L:  Maybe one of them Internet cafes or something, I don't know.
R:  Oh, that's a good idea. [NOISE] Yeah, actually, um, coffee has a huge market. [MN] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  People --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- make a lot of profit on coffee.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [MN] [NOISE] That's a good idea.  So, I think the other question was how would you go about doing it?
L:  How?  Um, I would -- I would find a place, like, uh, in a -- in a city that -- that isn't really well connected to the Internet.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  And has a lot of people that -- that might need it, like, for their job or something.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, open up a place in there.
R:  Oh, that's a good idea.  I'm not sure there are any cities left in the world that don't have [LAUGH] Internet access but [MN] --
L:  Well -- well, some place like, um, I don't know what state you're from but in South Jersey --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, they have -- it's like the Pine Barrens, they don't -- they don't have very much, uh, technology down there.  It's just --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- the woods.
R:  That sounds like a good idea. [PAUSE] [MN] Hm.
L:  And you just get a membership and, um, can use the Internet.
R:  [MN] Well, that's a good idea. [SIGH] Um, I guess I would, um, [MN] kinda do a similar thing.  Just sort of do a survey of the town and [MN], like, in my town [inaudible] a small town and there are two coffee places already but I think that the espresso connection would be a good one.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Because it's just, like, if you can't decide which coffee place to go to --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [MN] you might go to the one where you could get, um, both. [MN] So, I don't know how feasible that would be, I think it would have to be big but anyway, that's it.
L:  [NOISE] And what other -- what are the questions?  That's it?  How would --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you go about doing it?
R:  I think so, yeah.
L:  Oh well. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] I honestly think that, um, [MN] when they put us in these, um, [LIPSMACK] [MN] questions, they're actually [MN] looking more to see how we interact.  This is my guess. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [MN] Well, when I called they said they were doing the, um, the research for, um, computer analysis, like, with voice patterns and [MN], um, computer interaction.  I don't know.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Computer analysis.  Huh.  I wonder if they run it through a computer system or something and they just want us to talk?
L:  I think so.  Like, if -- like, if they're making, like, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't know, maybe they're developing some kind of new technology or something with, um, like, use your voice patterns to -- to operate a computer or something and they're just trying to [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [COUGH] like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- take our --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- voice pattern and, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [MN] and -- and --
R:  [NOISE] Huh.
L:  -- key it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to different --
R:  [MN] You know, the strange thing is though that wouldn't they use somebody -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean, I believe you, but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it seems odd that they wouldn't, um, use someone that already works for them. [LAUGH] That's already being paid.
L:  Well -- well, see, what -- what I would think is that they --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- being that they have, um, [NOISE] so many [NOISE], like, different voice patterns, that they're just trying to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- make it so that if they make a program it's not just to one.
R:  [NOISE] [NOISE]
L:  Like, just to the programmer.  
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  So, they --
R:  Oh, sort of like speech recognition?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [MN] Hm.  Well, that's pretty interesting.  Yeah, because the questions are usually so nebulous that --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  Like yesterday it was like, if you would take a million dollars to leave the U.S. would you do it, why and ...
R:  Did you have to leave forever? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  But you have a million dollars and you can go to any country you want. [NOISE]
R:  Would you do it?
L:  Yeah, I said I would go to, uh, Australia. [NOISE]
R:  Huh.  Forever and ever and never come back.
L:  Yes.
R:  M- -- a million dollars doesn't last very long. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, well -- well, the -- the American dollar doesn't -- isn't the same in, like, other countries.
R:  That's true.
L:  So, you know --
R:  [NOISE] I just -- yeah, I'm sure you're right.  It is a little cheaper in Australia. [NOISE] Although the dollar --
L:  And plus --
R:  -- isn't as strong as --
L:  -- and plus I'd --
R:  -- it once was.
L:  See, I -- I'm still a student, like --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, when I'm done with college I'm -- I'm [MN] moving out of the U.S.
R:  Really?
L:  I've been thinking about moving to Australia or England.
R:  Huh.  Well, that's interesting.  Huh.  Well, well.  Because of our President or [LAUGH] ... ?
L:  Um, I don't know.  I don't like the economy in -- in general.  It's just -- I don't know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- why, it's just -- it -- it just something about America that --
R:  It's gonna bounce back.
L:  [MN] It will eventually but, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- till then I might as well have fun in another country.
R:  [MN]
L:  [MN]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You get to explore more.
R:  Hm.
L:  And, you know, I -- I picked England and, uh, Australia because, you know, you don't got to learn a new language.
R:  Yeah.  Australia's very much like --
L:  Or a new profession.
R:  -- very much like here.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Very low key.  I've been to Australia.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  And it's --
L:  Is it nice?
R:  Yeah, it is.  It is very much like here.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  The, um, politics aren't as crazy, too. [MN]
L:  Is it -- what -- what kind governmental system do they have?  Democratic or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  I mean, there is, um, I believe they have socialized medicine. [MN] I'm --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- pretty darn sure they have socialized medicine.  But, um, other than that [PAUSE] [MN], um --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- they just don't have as many people with their personal agenda as in the government.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Or so it seems. [MN]
L:  Well.
R:  So ...
L:  [MN] I don't -- I don't know, I didn't -- I didn't expect, uh, Australia to have a democracy like that.  Like --
R:  What did you think?
L:  -- is it -- is it a democracy like ours or [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah. [MN] They're, u- um, their politicians are all elected --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- in a democratic fashion.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [MN] I mean, they do have a connection to, um, you know, Great Britain --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [MN] but they really run their own show.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Hm.  Good to know.
R:  Yup. [MN] So --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- how many minutes have we done, do you know?
L:  I have no idea.
R:  Mm.
L:  I -- I just usually go with it and --
R:  [NOISE] Wait and see?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hm.  Is this your third one?
L:  Mm, this is my second.
R:  Oh. [NOISE] 
L:  If you do, um, I don't know -- how many -- how -- how long have you been doing this?
R:  [MN] Not long, this is my third one and I think you can only do three.
L:  Oh.  Okay.
R:  [NOISE] So ... And it's always been men that I talk to.
L:  No.  No, this is the second one and it's been a woman, so -- so --
R:  Huh.  Maybe they always pair men and women?
L:  No, I think it's just, um, like, whoever connects at the same time.
R:  Hm.  Well, that makes sense.
L:  'Cause yesterday I had to wait, like, forever and then today [NOISE] just, soon as I put my numbers in.
R:  Yeah, actually it's 'cause I was waiting --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a little while.
L:  That's why.
R:  While I was online.
L:  That's some really cheesy music they got.
R:  Oh, I thought that was your music. [LAUGH]
L:  My music?
R:  I thought you had that music playing at your house.
L:  Oh, you mean y- -- no, I'm talking about when you're waiting.
R:  Oh, that.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  That's my music in the background.
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, that is really cheesy music.  Same two elevator songs over and over.
L:  Yeah, it's, ugh, it's like [NOISE] some, [MN] um, electronic, uh, classic -- classical.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN]
R:  So, what are you listening to?
L:  Uh, tech -- well, techno.  It's club.
R:  Oh, club music.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [MN] Maybe you should open a club?
L:  [MN] Wouldn't be a bad idea.
R:  Yeah, I guess --
L:  But, uh --
R:  -- they probably make a lot of money.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, but you have to find a place, like, you know, that -- that a lot of people --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like a party t- -- a party city.
R:  And clubs don't last all that long, do they?
L:  No. [MN] You know what I would do though, I would open up one near, like, um, near -- near a, uh, college -- college campus.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause then, you know, especially one of the college campuses where the students don't, um, don't -- aren't allowed to party that much.  They can have parties but they can't have liquor.
R:  Oh, like in Utah. [LAUGH]
L:  Really?  I didn't know that.
R:  Well, the Mormons.
L:  Oh, 'kay.
R:  [MN] They're not supposed to drink.
L:  [NOISE] No, see in Jersey we got, you know, we don't have many laws.  We only have a couple, like, with, um, the -- the private colleges.  Like, the, um --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- not private, but, like, um, parochial.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And they can't drink?
L:  No.  Not on campus.  You're allowed --
R:  Not on campus.
L:  -- to drink but not on campus.
R:  Well, there must be clubs around there though, huh?
L:  [NOISE] Some.  Some.  'Cause I -- I don't know, have you ever been to Jersey?
R:  Um, yeah, but not much.
L:  Okay.  Jersey is more, um, you know, it's -- it's -- it's got towns that are, like, houses and, you know, small businesses mostly.  'Cause we're right near --
R:  It's more suburban?
L:  Yeah.  We're right near, um, Philly and, uh, New York. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, s- -- right in the middle.  So --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, we have the -- the best of two worlds.  We don't have to open up big businesses here and we just travel, take a bus or a subway and get right there.
R:  [MN] So, do you think that there -- that people would go to a club that was right there in Jersey?
L:  Oh, of course.
R:  Hm.
L:  [NOISE]
