L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, I'm Nurena.
R:  I'm Cara.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And, where are you from?
L:  I'm actually -- well, I'm in Fort Lauderdale.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm in Mississippi right now.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah, so, I guess our question is, ah ...
L:  Being given a million dollars.
R:  [inaudible] Yeah, would you?
L:  [SIGH] I'm wondering how he would kn- -- or she would know that I didn't keep in touch with my best friend.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I don't think I would.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Yeah, I think friendships are too important, and [SIGH] yeah, a million dollars would be nice, I don't think it's worth it.
L:  [MN] [several inaudible words] is --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- worth it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] It's really hard, 'cause, like, [SIGH] I could use that money, couldn't I?  But --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- having friendship in the end is worth it.
L:  It is.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I suppose [several inaudible words] a bit sneaky thinking that how would they find out.  It's like --
R:  Huh?
L:  -- how would they find out --
R:  I know --
L:  -- if I took the money, and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- still ...
R:  Well, you couldn't talk to them, right?
L:  Mm.
R:  You couldn't talk to them, or anything like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That would be hard.
L:  [inaudible] --
R:  So, I -- I -- I'd have to say no, but, you know, I hope I wouldn't regret it down the line [LAUGH].
L:  True.
R:  But, [LIPSMACK] so ...
L:  No, I don't think I would.
R:  No, me neither.
L:  Yeah, because also it's not like -- that's the only way that you can get money.
R:  Yeah, of course.
L:  You know?
R:  There's other ways.
L:  Ah, I mean, if it was something like your life [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Maybe I would think about it more.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  But ...
L:  Oh.
R:  So, have you done these calls before?
L:  Oh, this is my first one.
R:  Yeah, mine too.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH] It's kind of interesting.
R:  Yeah, it is.
L:  I wonder what they're looking for?
R:  I'm not sure, I guess how people talk to each other, or ...
L:  Mm.
R:  And, all their reactions to questions, or, I don't know.
L:  Hm.
R:  It's interesting though.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I thought I'd give it a shot.
L:  I know, I did, too -- I'm a student [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- it's like why not?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, there's nothing to lose.
L:  True.
R:  [SIGH] But, [MN] so ... [LAUGH] 
L:  Are you originally from Mississippi?
R:  [SIGH] No, I'm actually from Minnesota, um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I, um, my -- my boyfriend is in the navy, so, we travel --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- go to different places every, like, two years.
L:  Oh.
R:  [MN] So, we're just here for now, and probably be leaving within -- at least -- probably by the end of the year we'll move somewhere else, and ...
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But, we were in Florida -- we were in Pensacola for -- for like a year.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And, you said you were -- where are you from?
L:  I'm in -- well, I'm in Fort Lauderdale --
R:  Oh, you're in Fort Lauderdale.
L:  -- at the moment.  Yeah.  But, that's something I've always wanted to do, is travel around.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We get to go to all different kinds of places, so I'm really excited --
L:  Mm.
R:  I'm from Minnesota, so, it's nice to go somewhere where it's warm, so ...
L:  Uh-huh, I see what you mean.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, [inaudible] --
L:  I just [inaudible] school in Canada for three years --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- in Montreal, so, it's like, one extreme to another.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] oh, yeah.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  Can you take the heat, or is it ... hard for you?
L:  It's too much.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, oh, I know.
L:  It's hard to take the heat.
R:  The humidity is the worst.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's the worst.
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  Makes my hair frizz.
L:  Oh.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Don't get me started.
R:  [LAUGH] You have the same thing?  I hate it.
L:  Yeah, I just find the air conditioning way too cold.
R:  Yeah, I know, you can never find a -- like, a happy medium.
L:  Mm.
R:  They're always turning it up or down, or up or down.
L:  Exactly, it's like --
R:  I hate it. [LAUGH].
L:  Ah, 'cause like, I go outdoors in, like, sleeveless tops, and carry a sweater with me [LAUGH] --
R:  I know.
L:  -- [several inaudible words] get indoors.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I know, you go into a restaurant and you're freezing.
L:  Mm.
R:  It's just [SIGH] ... but [SIGH] ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] So, will this thing just turn off, or ...?
L:  [SIGH] Well, they said they'd let us know after ten minutes.
R:  Oh, right.
L:  And, then we can give comments.
R:  All right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  I guess we'll see.
R:  [inaudible] How did, ah, you find out about this?
L:  Ah, from a website.
R:  From a website?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I found out about it on, ah, on this -- have you ever heard of Freelance [inaudible] dot com?
L:  No.
R:  Okay, well, that's -- I guess a lot of the people from there are going on this website and doing these [SIGH], so, everyone's meeting each other that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- talk to each other online, but ...
L:  Oh.
R:  It's like -- it's a site for, like, frugal people, who want to --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- save money.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's -- that's me, so --
L:  Oh, me too.
R:  -- that's how I found it. [MN] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I was like, "Wow, ten dollars to talk on the phone, that's great".
L:  [LAUGH] I can do that.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Talking's not that hard.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] But [SIGH] ... hm -- I don't know what to say.  We answered the question.
L:  True.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  [MN] I guess -- well, we could just chat until the ten minutes are over.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That sounds okay to me [MN], so, what do you do?
L:  I'm in graduate school.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, I'm studying conflict analysis and resolution.
R:  Wow.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] It sounds more wild than it is.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] But, it's fun.  [LAUGH]
R:  Jeeze. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah, so, I --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- just started about two months ago.
R:  Oh, really -- do you like it?
L:  Yeah.  I do, I really like the course --
R:  That's good.
L:  -- it's really interesting, yeah.
R:  Wow, very interesting.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You don't hear that one a lot.
L:  [inaudible] it's very new.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I think there are only two schools in the US that offer it.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Ah ...
R:  Wow.  [SIGH] 
L:  See how it goes.
R:  Well, I hope it goes well for you.
L:  Thank you.
R:  [MN]
L:  Thanks, so, what about you -- what are you up to?
R:  Well, right now, I'm just kind of -- we're in Mississippi, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I really hate it here, and there's --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- not much to do, and ... I don't -- I really don't know what I want to do -- I'm thinking of going towards interior design, but --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- not sure ... [inaudible] --
L:  It's an interesting field.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Um ...
R:  But, I'm just really, really tired of Mississippi, so, I can't --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- wait 'til we leave.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's just not the greatest place to live.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Noone would choose to live here, so ...
L:  Oh.
R:  I really hate that -- the only reason people stay is because of, you know, family, or --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- but, I guess everyone tries to get out of here, so ...
L:  Ah.
R:  But ... [MN]
L:  No, but, I can empathize 'cause, I mean, I've only been here a few months and it's definitely a city where you need a car.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  And, I don't have a car.
R:  Oh, no.
L:  And, I didn't know anyone when I got here --
R:  [SIGH] What do you do -- is there a bus, or ...?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, well there's a -- I take the bus, usually --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- but, I really just spend most of my time on campus.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, [inaudible] --
R:  Do you live close to campus, or ...?
L:  Ah, I live on campus.
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  Yeah, [SIGH] --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- but, it just -- I mean, sometimes I started second guessing myself for -- you know, did I really need to come back to school --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- because, I mean, I love the course, but my life apart from school is basically non existent.
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well -- well, have you met any people since?
L:  Oh, I have, but, you know, how -- particularly people -- [inaudible] most of the people in my course are, like, you know, professionals coming back to school --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, are married, or have children --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and have jobs, [SIGH] so, I mean, there aren't that many, like, just full time students.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I hope you meet some people, and ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]
R:  I'm glad there's a bus, though, 'cause -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I -- I -- I just started learning how to drive -- I was always too afraid to drive, and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I can't imagine not driving anymore.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just -- you can't get anywhere.
L:  [LAUGH] True --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you're completely stranded. 
R:  I know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And, it doesn't do well for your social life, so ...
L:  No, not at all, and even just having the option of, you know -- if I could just leave at the drop of a hat, like, you know?
R:  Yeah, I know --
L:  You know?
R:  -- and you have to look at the schedule, and make sure the bus is going to be there, and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- just [SIGH] -- a lot easier with a car.  
L:  Yep.
R:  [SIGH] But ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's good you live on campus though, so [MN] ...
L:  Yes, that really makes a big difference.  
R:  Yeah, oh yeah --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I bet [MN].
L:  Yeah, but, I'm thinking, oh my gosh, if I wanna be here for two years, I think I need to get a car.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That might be easier.
L:  Yeah, 'cause at first I was like, oh, two years, it's too expensive --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, now ... [LAUGH]
R:  Maybe you could, like, get a, you know, a used car or something --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- something just to get you around.
L:  Mhm, [several inaudible words].
R:  Doesn't have to be a cadillac, or --
L:  [LAUGH] No.
R:  -- [LAUGH] just something simple.
L:  [LAUGH] Just to get from A to B.  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that's all you need.  [MN] But ... well, I -- I hope everything goes well for you and you --
L:  Thank you.
R:  -- enjoy grad school.
L:  Thank you, and --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- and you too with your future plans.
R:  Yeah, I hope -- I think it will be good once we get out of here.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [LAUGH] [several inaudible words].
R:  Oh, yeah, I can't wait.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Oh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  How long have you been there?
R:  Um, it's almost been nine months, I think.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, we're both really, really excited to move.
L:  Oh.
R:  I think we're probably gonna go to California, so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that'll be a lot different.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] It'll be nice to get away and be by the ocean.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I love the ocean.  [MN]
L:  That would be really nice.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH] Mm.
L:  And, are you planning on getting married?
R:  Yeah, actually, we've been talking about it a lot now --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- before it was kind of a sore subject [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- but, now, we're ...
