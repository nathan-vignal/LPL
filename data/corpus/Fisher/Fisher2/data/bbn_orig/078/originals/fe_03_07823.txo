R:  Alex.
L:  Vera.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  How are you?
L:  I'm fine.  Now I've never done this before so this is all [LAUGH] new to me.  This is my first call.
R:  Oh, okay.  It's my third time.  Um --
L:  Okay, so if -- if you can help me in any way or tell me if +I'm -- I'm not talking the way I should or whatever.
R:  Oh, I [MN] --
L:  Please do.  
R:  I don't set the rules.  It's basically just [MN] --
L:  No, I mean, just whatever --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there rules are since you've done it before.  
R:  Oh, right.  Um, so the question is kind a strange.  Um --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't know.  You want to go first?
L:  Yeah.  I will.
R:  Okay.
L:  Uh, no.  I wouldn't accept a million dollars to leave this country.  
R:  Okay.  
L:  And --
R:  [MN] --
L:  Just because I -- I'm very, you know, I'm very much in favor of this country and I don't feel I could -- like to ever leave it.  
R:  Okay.  I -- I agree the same way.  Uh, actually I was not born in +here.  I came here from, um, former Soviet Union.
L:  Oh.  Great.
R:  And -- yes.  And, um, I'm a naturalized citizen and I would not trade [LAUGH] my citizenship for anything else.  
L:  Well, that's wonderful.  
R:  So a million dollars sounds great.
L:  It does, doesn't it?  [LAUGH] 
R:  I would leave for a while, maybe a year or two, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then come back but never, uh, would leave for -- as a matter of fact I just went back to Russia last month.  First time in fifteen years and, um, just prove to me again that this is the place where I want to be.
L:  That you made the right choice?
R:  Exactly.
L:  Oh, that's wonderful.
R:  So, um, yes, I would definitely wouldn't go anywhere.
L:  Yeah, it just -- uh, I think for me it just -- it's frightening and I would never want to do it but also because I don't think there's any other country in the world that has the freedoms we have and has --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [MN] what -- what we have.  What we benefit from.
R:  Right.  I -- I agree.  I agree.
L:  So I don't -- I know I would never leave.  
R:  Yes.  Uh --
L:  For any amount of money.  I'd stay here even if, you know, I'm broke, which I am.  [LAUGH]  I'm not broke but, I mean, you know, I'd -- I'd stay here and work for whatever I have --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to.  
R:  Right.  I believe there are much more opportunities here than in some European country, for instance.
L:  And +what other countries have you been to?
R:  Um, I've been to Germany, Austria, Italy and Russia.
L:  Oh.
R:  And Cana- Canada.
L:  My -- grand --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, now my grandparents are from Austria.
R:  Oh, okay,
L:  I -- I mean, I'm doing that -- my family tree.  I -- I'm finding that out.  But --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, well, my -- my grandfather's from Hungary.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But my grandmother is from Austria.  But, um, you know, I -- I mean, I find it very interesting but, yeah, so maybe -- maybe for a vacation but that's not the way I understood this.
R:  Right.
L:  The question --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to mean.  I -- I -- [MN] I understood it to mean, would you leave?
R:  Right and never come back.
L:  And no I wouldn't.  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  That --
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's the way I understood the question.
R:  Right.  Um, even -- even, um, the fact that you would have to get through all the difficulties and learn the language and things like that.  This is, you know, tremendous amount of work and I've done it before.  I am not [LAUGH] willing to do it again.
L:  Yeah, that was my other question for you was, did you, um, when you came here could you speak English?
R:  Uh, no.  I was sixteen.  I, um --
L:  Because you speak --
R:  I --
L:  -- wonderful [LAUGH] English.
R:  Thank you.  [LAUGH]  Um, I -- I -- I spoke maybe, you know, uh, maybe I knew about twenty, thirty words.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, 'cause I [MN] -- I learned French in school.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, um, [LIPSMACK] it was, uh, it was just, you know, basic learning.  You know, went to high school for two years here, but now it would've been much harder because I'm already thirty and, um, it's just -- I wouldn't want to go through this again.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, e- e- even Russia because, you know, I speak fluent Russian.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Even going back and living -- living there for a million dollars.  I wouldn't do it because it's just --
L:  Well, you've -- you've already been there and you've [LAUGH] left so --  
R:  Yes.
L:  -- you don't -- you wouldn't --
R:  Exactly.
L:  I'm sure there's --
R:  I spent a week there.
L:  -- many reasons --
R:  It was great but ...
L:  -- you wouldn't want to go back.  Yeah.
R:  Yes.  I -- I don't want to go back because just ...  And I love this country and, um, +especially after nine eleven.  
L:  Oh, God.
R:  I feel so patriotic now.
L:  Do you?  That's wonderful.
R:  And all that -- money is not an issue here.  I mean ...
L:  You know I had a very difficult time after nine eleven, and I still do when it's brought up, like, for some reason it's, you know, talked about at length or something.  It was very, very difficult.  Just --
R:  Right.
L:  -- very frightening.  But -- but, you know, if we have to go so -- through something like that again I wouldn't leave because of it.  
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, that's -- this is where -- this is where I want to be.  And, you know, I just -- I -- I feel very strongly about that.
R:  Right.  Well, I -- I'm glad to hear it.  [MN]  Everytime I hear somebody --
L:  But I -- I find that very interesting.  That it -- that you've become even more, you know, patriotic because of nine eleven.
R:  Um --
L:  That's really -- that's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- really ...
R:  Definitely.  Yeah.
L:  I mean, you've not had any problems?  You know, 'cause a lot of peo- foreign people, and I don't know if you consider yourself foreign, or not.
R:  [MN]
L:  But have had problems.  You know.
R:  Um, no, because you know, I'm -- I don't look, uh, Arabic.  I --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, I'm Russian and, uh --
L:  And I -- I feel -- I'm very concerned about that.  You know, the -- the -- the fact that there are some, you know, people who -- who are, you know, experiencing some problems, but I also have to be very honest with you and say that I think -- I'm sorry, but I think people need to be checked out more.
R:  Right.
L:  Apparently we weren't doing the job we should've been doing.  
R:  Right.  This is the whole --
L:  I -- I think it's very --
R:  -- issue of, uh ...
L:  -- important that we know exactly what we're dealing with.
R:  Right.  And this is the whole +issue of racial profiling which I am --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- totally for because, you know, if -- if it happened to be nineteen white hijackers then look for white guys.  If it happened --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- to be nineteen Saudi Arabi- -- 
L:  Yeah, that's -- now that's --
R:  [MN] Saudi [LAUGH] Arabian.
L:  See, I'm never really -- I've never really thought of that.  But that's very true.  
R:  You know.
L:  If it would be nineteen white hijackers then we better -- we better profile those people [LAUGH] too.
R:  Exactly.  I mean, [several inaudible words] was white.
L:  So, I've never really --
R:  You know.
L:  -- thought of that.  That's great that you mentioned that.
R:  It's just basic, you know -- I don't know, it's statistics.  So --
L:  [MN]
R: -- commonsense, I think, you know.
L:  Well, it really is.  I don't think we've ever been put in this position --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or -- fortunately.  And that's why we have to do that.
R:  Right.
L:  We have to check things out now.  And, you know, I'm very much -- I'm very aware of -- of my surroundings now.  And, uh, yeah, if I see something -- which just the other day, in my neighborhood.  [LAUGH] I -- I mean I live in a very, like, suburban --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- neighborhood.  Just -- just real calm and, you know, middle class. 
R:  Right.
L:  And I saw two people walking who totally didn't belong here.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, and this is a very -- this neighborhood is very friendly and wa- -- people walk everyday.  I mean, it's just the -- you know, everybody walks and that's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- their thing.  And I have a huge -- huge front porch, or deck, and I sit outside all day, you know, and just enjoy, when I can.  And, um, there were two people that just -- there was -- they just weren't right, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I mentioned it to my mailman who is a great guy who [MN] concerned about me and all because I'm -- I'm -- I'm widowed and -- and live alone, and he's always checking on me to make sure everything's okay.  And he -- and I mentioned it to him and I said, "So, when you're driving around" I said, uh, "You know, just keep your eyes open 'cause it just doesn't look right".  And he said, "I noticed them and I'm already ..."  You know he said, "I've already, you know, had my eye on 'em".
R:  Right.
L:  He said they -- they aren't from this neighborhood.  It's a small neighborhood and he said they're not from here and I --
R:  Right.
L:  And so we're just aware of it now.
R:  Right.
L:  And I think that's important that we all --
R:  It is [inaudible]. 
L:  -- are.
R:  Right.  Uh, it is very important, so ...
L:  Yeah.  In -- in a way, I guess that was profiling.  But --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, if it was, it was.  [LAUGH] Because --
R:  E- e- --
L:  -- I --
R:  -- exactly.  No [MN] --
L:  I just thought [MN] he said -- when he mentioned that just the other -- he said just a month ago and he mentioned the person's name.  He said their neigh- -- their house got broken into.  He said they were only gone for a hal- -- an hour and a half and he said there was five thousand dollars worth of, you know, uh, merchandise stolen from their house and he said -- and there were no signs of entry or -- or exit.  
R:  Right.
L:  And he said -- and, you know, and the house wasn't locked or -- I mean, wasn't unlocked.  You know, he said so, you know, this is why -- this is what we need to do, is be aware of, you know, people that just don't fit.
R:  [MN]  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I do it all the time, even when we're flying to Russian, uh, last month.  We were flying out of Logan.  I mean --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- this was the airport where the -- the whole --
L:  Oh, were you?
R:  -- thing start- --
L:  Out of Logan, [MN].  Wow.
R:  Yeah.  I'm -- I'm --
L:  I know.
R:  -- from Salem, Mass.  
L:  Oh, okay.  So, that, yeah.
R:  So, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And when we were landing in Frankfurt in Germany and this was another terrorist, uh --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you know --
L:  Mhm.  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- [inaudible], you know.
L:  Germany's a very big ...  Yeah.
R:  So I was looking out for these people and, you know, I didn't feel ashamed at all.  
L:  No.
R:  Because, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as I said if they were all like [several inaudible words] kind of --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- people I would look for those kind of guys.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.
L:  If they were what?
R:  Like the [several inaudible words] --
L:  Oh.  Oh.  See --
R:  You know.
L:  See and now -- you know, I had more -- to be honest with you I had more trouble with that.  I think it was my granddaughter was just like a year and a half when that happened.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And to this day, see just even the mention of his name makes me emotional.
R:  Right.
L:  And I just, you know, I cried and cried and cried for t- -- and I [MN] and I feel emotional right now.  [MN]  You know, and he was an American and, you know, he was not anyway, you know, so I'm -- I am profiling but in the same sense I'm just profiling.  
R:  Right.
L:  Just like I said about these people that were walking --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in the neighborhood.  So, no.  You're right.  You just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- have to be aware of what's going on and I think we had be- become complacent and weren't aware of --
R:  Right.
L:  -- anything.  We just --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- kind a got on the plane, you know, 'cause I fly too.  And just got on a plane.  Never thought of -- you know, got on.  Got your little headrest out.  Got your pillow out, you know.  
R:  Right.
L:  Went to sleep or did whatever you wanted to do.  
R:  Right.
L:  And didn't pay attention to who was on there and who was around you or what was going on and ...
R:  Right.
L:  And it's just so great that we now are aware of that.
R:  Right.  And -- and this is another reason why I don't like those European countries because they are very, uh, socialist and they're very relaxed in that -- in those terms and they let, um, people who are not always, you know, mean well for the -- their --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- country.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They'll let them make the decisions and ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because they -- they -- they feel guilty, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- for [MN] -- for, you know, having all
