R:  Hi, I'm --
L:  H-
R:  -- Joyce.
L:  Hi, I'm Diana.
R:  Hi Diana.  Boy, what a question!
L:  I know [LAUGH] --
R:  It -- it almost --
L:  -- it's tough.
R:  -- stopped my heart.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Sure is.
R:  I -- I -- I can't imagine not talking to my best friend.
L:  [NOISE] That is true, but, a million dollars is pretty tempting.
R:  [SIGH] It is -- I would -- I would have to stop and think probably a long time, but, boy, I can't imagine being without my best friend.
L:  [LIPSMACK] I know what you mean -- I know what you mean, that would be really tough ... especially, [SIGH] I don't know -- especially, because you're not really that close with that many people.
R:  Right, I -- I have many friends, but, only one best friend.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, she means everything to me, and I -- I can't imagine not being able to talk to her -- that just -- [MN] that just doesn't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- compute.
L:  I know.
R:  In my brain.
L:  [NOISE] I know, I know [NOISE] -- personally I think my best friend is my sister [NOISE].
R:  Well, then that would be excluding --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- family.
L:  Sorry, I just dropped the phone.
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] My best friend is my sister, so, that makes it kinda -- even harder.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] I don't know -- I -- I -- [LAUGH] I am unemployed right now though --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so, that would [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [several inaudible words] the money --
R:  Well, that would influence you a bit.
L:  [LAUGH] A million dollars re- -- sounds great.  But, yeah, I don't -- I don't think I could do it --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- it would seem so superficial.
R:  [SIGH] It would, I -- I don't -- I don't think -- I don't know, a million dollars is a lot of money though.
L:  [SIGH] It really is.  It really is a lot of money -- would definitely be tempting.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I -- I [MN] it's even hard to talk about the topic.
L:  Right, right, it really is.  You know, I'm stretching a little bit here [LAUGH] -- [SIGH] it's kinda -- I don't know though, [SIGH] I -- I don't think I could do it -- you know, I'd cheat, but I'd probably regret it, in a way.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Regret, you know -- I know I'd be thinking about if I had that money ...
R:  Yeah, well [MN] --
L:  It would really be helpful.  [MN] 
R:  For you with your fr- -- best friend being your sister, that -- that would be really hard to exclude a family member --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and turn your back where, you know, my best friend is my best friend, but, she's not a family member, although we're like sisters, so --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- you know, I don't know -- it -- gosh, it's really something to [MN] more than just fantasize about, it's -- it's ... it's hard to even ...
L:  [NOISE] It is.
R:  It's hard to think about it.
L:  It absolutely is -- absolutely is.  [LIPSMACK] I think I could get rid of my husband quick [several inaudible words] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I would do that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, there are days, and I have a --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- seventeen year old --
L:  [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] absolutely true.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] There are days that would be a lot easier.
R:  And I -- I have a sister that I could actually do away with that way, you know, just --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- exclude her completely, and that would be fine, but, I mean, with some people it's easy to do that with, and then others there's just no way.
L:  Yep, yep, that's so true.
R:  So, I don't know if I could do it, or not.
L:  Best friends are hard to come -- I mean, friends are hard to come by --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- let alone, you know, somebody that you're totally comfortable with, and can tell anything to, and they don't judge you.
R:  And, would do anything for you.
L:  Exactly, exactly.
R:  That's the big thing, is someone that you know you can trust to do whatever needs to be done.
L:  And, how do you put a price on that?
R:  You don't.
L:  You really can't.
R:  You know, I -- my best friend -- a -- a situation just came up where we're having to go on vacation -- my son is a swimmer, and he has to go to a different city and swim, well, we have to come back -- we would have to come back from vacation in order for him to do that, but she says, "Don't worry, he can stay at my house" -- because she lives near where he needs to be.
L:  Oh.
R:  "He can stay here, I'll take care of him.  I'll send him on his way each morning."
L:  And you can leave him there knowing --
R:  I can leave him there knowing that everything's fine.
L:  Yep, and -- and enjoy your vacation and you don't -- you're not gonna worry about him like --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- you would.
R:  Exactly, exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, only my best friend would do that for me.
L:  Right, right.
R:  You know, [MN] family would, but, I mean, I don't have family in the -- in this area, where -- where he needs to be --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but, um, I know that I can trust her to take care of him, and -- and she's gonna worry about him like I would, and [LAUGH], you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- she's gonna -- she's gonna see that he's take -- cared for, and that's -- that's just such a -- a weight off my shoulders, um, I couldn't -- I couldn't leave without her --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, without her being there for me.  So, anyway, it's -- I -- I think of the things that we have done for each other over the years, and, um ... you know, I couldn't survive without her --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just knowing that she's there, and we don't see each other that often -- we live, probably sixty, seventy miles apart.
L:  [MN] Oh, wow, and you still stay very close.
R:  Oh, yeah, we have to talk at least once a week, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and we -- we get together whenever we can, you know.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, you really can't put a price on something like that -- how could you enjoy the money, you know?  When you don't have, you know, friends to share it with. 
R:  Exactly.
L:  Or, your best friend.
R:  Exactly, um --
L:  To share it with.
R:  -- and, it would be traveling and doing things with her -- our two families -- that would be the fun of enjoying that money.
L:  Exactly, exactly, some of the joy would be taken away.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] That's for sure.
R:  If it were anybody else, but -- but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- Carol, I could probably do it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And -- and it wouldn't be difficult, but, you know, have they -- [MN] if they had said family member, yeah, there's several.
L:  [LAUGH] I have a couple I'd like to --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- get rid of myself.  [LAUGH]
R:  But, a friend -- I mean, a friend is a friend forever.
L:  Yeah.
R:  A good friend is a friend forever.
L:  [NOISE] And it really -- it's so hard to find people you just totally connect with.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It really is.
R:  Yeah, I have -- I have other friends, but, they don't measure up -- not the -- not the same way.
L:  And, a lot of friends, you know, come and go, you know, your -- your -- you [SIGH] do things with certain people because you have certain things in common, but, the endurance, you know, isn't there.
R:  Exactly, exactly.
L:  You know, and it's not that you're not friends with them anymore, they just, you know, after a certain period of time they -- they sort of fade away.
R:  Exactly, that happens a lot.
L:  But, you know, to -- to have a best friend ... lasts.
R:  Yeah, it's -- I don't know, I -- it would be easier with family.
L:  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK] Yes.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, we have about three minutes to go here.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We've about talked it out, haven't we?
L:  [LAUGH] I know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- this was kind of a hard one.
R:  I've had some [several inaudible words] --
L:  It would be better if we disagreed, huh?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it would --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it would -- it'd be easier [SIGH].
L:  It sure would.
R:  Um, this is my second one that I've done, [MN] and the -- the first two were really interesting, and -- and, you know, this one's just so hard, it's --
L:  What were the other ones on?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, if you could go back in time, and do something different -- would you?
L:  Oh, that is a good one.
R:  Oh, that was -- that was really easy to do, and it was very thought provoking for me --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to think about the changes that I would make, and I would definitely make some major changes.
L:  Absolutely, absolutely.
R:  So, that was -- that was a fun one to do.
L:  This is my first one.
R:  Oh.
L:  I've missed -- I've missed them before --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- whenever, um, they called.
R:  I -- I had missed one and then I've -- I've connected, so, I ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, I'm on my third one, I guess it's all I get.
L:  Mm, yeah.
R:  I think -- I think they said three.
L:  [SIGH] I thought it was three a week?
R:  Oh, really?
L:  I -- I could be wrong, I thought I -- I read three per week -- it could --
R:  Well, that would be nice.
L:  -- be up to three per week.
R:  Well, that would be nice.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yes, it would.  But, yeah, I definitely have to say, I -- as much as I would like the money, I don't think I could do it either.
R:  [SIGH] It would be really hard, I -- it -- it just -- I don't know ... anybody else ... 
L:  Just about, yeah.
R:  You know, a -- a neighbor even, I could -- I've --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I've got some very nice neighbors --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but, I could turn my back on them if I had to for a million bucks.
L:  I've got a couple that I'd be willing to pay to get rid of.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Or, at least their dog [LAUGH] --
R:  Does it howl?
L:  -- that barks.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well, we've got those too, but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- um, gosh, [MN] I don't how anybody -- [SIGH] you know, it would be interesting to see what -- what would really happen, I mean, this is hypothetical, what if it really happened?
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  What would -- what would, I mean, then you're really -- you're really --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- faced with the decision, and what do you do?
L:  Yeah, it's easy to say no when you don't -- when you really don't --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- know you're not gonna get anything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, it's easy to do the right thing, now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, whenever you --
R:  When you're really in the trenches --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and you have to make the decision, I don't know.
L:  It's very -- that -- you're right, you're absolutely right.
R:  And, you know --
L:  That makes a big difference.
R:  -- if I could talk to her and say, "Listen Carol, this is the story ... will you -- will you forgive me if I do this?", she'd probably say, "Heck, yeah".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] Yeah, then that would be okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Then I could maybe do it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but ...
