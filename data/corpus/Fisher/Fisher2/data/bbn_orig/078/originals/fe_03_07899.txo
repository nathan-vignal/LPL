L:  Hello?
R:  Oh, hi, my name is Anne.
L:  Hi, I'm -- my name is Sue.
R:  Sue?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I -- I -- I haven't, ah, done one of these before -- this is my first time, so, w- we just talk, ah, for ten minutes about this, ah, hypothetical question that -- what if someone gave us a -- a million dollars, but, ah, the stipulation was that, ah, we had to [SIGH] never speak to our best friend?
L:  I think that's right, I haven't done one of these calls before either, but --
R:  Oh, okay, so, we're --
L:  So, we're both -- yeah.
R:  -- both first timers [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Um --
R:  -- okay, well, I -- I guess, ah, the -- the choice is easy for me, you know?  Like, I mean, my -- my friends are much more important to me, than money, so, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- y- you know, that -- that wouldn't, you know, of course, I -- you know, there's a lot of things I could do with a million dollars, it'd be wonderful to have it, but, ah, you know, my friends are much more important to me, I mean, where would you be without your friends?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I -- no, I agree with you too, [MN] it -- I really wouldn't have to think about that choice, I mean ... you know ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, a million dollars -- it seems like a lot of money, but, it's really not I guess, and how fast could you spend a million dollars?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And, then you wouldn't have -- you know, you would never be able to speak to your best friend again.
R:  Oh, yeah, I -- I mean, I think people would really, [SIGH] um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, think twice about you if they found that out about you -- I don't think you'd have many friends left at all, if they [LAUGH] found out that you took this money not to speak to your best friend, [SIGH] you -- you know, and -- and, ah, I mean you hear about all these people who win lottery, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, well, lotteries, and -- and, ah, you know, they -- they blow their money in no time, and -- and, ah, it totally ruins their lives.
L:  Right, but, then again I guess, if you're younger -- which I'm not younger, but, if you're younger you might think, "Oh, I can make another best friend, I ...", you know?
R:  That's true, yeah.
L:  Um, I wonder if younger people would -- would be more prone to take the money.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Than older people.
R:  Yeah, I guess, es- especially, you know, if they're trying to get ahead, and, ah, you know, I guess some people are very, ah, you know, [SIGH] money conscious and, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, I -- our society is so materialistic, and ah, I -- yeah, I -- I think, yeah, that's right, yeah -- you know, someone who's younger might be very [SIGH] tempted to do that and think, "Yeah --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- you know, what's, you know ... [SIGH] ah, what's a friend?", yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK] That's --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- that's true, I mean, especially when you just got out -- get out of college, you think, oh, you know, "I'm not gonna see these people again".
R:  Yeah, yeah, that's true, yeah, and -- and I mean, especially when you're, you know, sort of going through that time in your life where, yeah, you -- you may not see these people again, yeah, so, I guess -- yeah, that would be very, ah, tempting I -- I -- I can see that, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Gee, we're [LAUGH] --
R:  It's kinda hard to [LAUGH] --
L:  -- it's -- it's kinda hard to talk about it, if we both --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- agree on something.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's right, my goodness, ah, [MN], um, I -- I guess you would be very tempted, though, if, um, you had some financial problems, my goodness, you know, if, ah, you know, you had a -- you know, someone who needed some m- medical, um, help and, ah, this would be a way out, you know, that -- that would --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- really be, ah, very tempting to get you out of that situation, and, ah -- and, ah, kind of live on easy street.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, or -- or if you'd never been in a situation before where you really need to rely on your friends, I mean, it's been my experience unfortunately, you don't -- you take 'em for granted --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- until you need 'em.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah, or something -- something happens and -- and people will surprise you.
R:  Yeah, yeah, that's true.  [MN] I -- I -- I guess I am sort of the person, who, you know, I -- I -- I'm quite independent, but, at the same time, you know, you -- you do need your friends, you -- you --you know, that's kind of the [SIGH] whole [MN] -- you know, the -- that's -- w- without friends it's very foreign, ah, um, my husband has a cousin right now who's moved to, ah, um, Toronto --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, ah, that's a really big city, and, ah, he really doesn't know very many people there, so, he -- he's finding it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- very difficult, and -- and, ah, you know, it kind of just makes you realize how important your friends are, because, ah -- he -- he had to take this job, because he had lost so many [SIGH] jobs --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, ah, he -- he was in a s- -- tricky situation, so, he just had to take this job, but, you know, moving to this big city, would just be awful for -- [SIGH] for me, I mean, I -- I -- I couldn't do that either, you know, 'cause my friends are so important, you know, like, [SIGH] I mean, sometimes you don't see your friends that often, but, ah, you know, it's just kinda nice to have them there, you know, for someone, to, ah, you know -- you got some problems and you kinda, [SIGH] you -- you know, or you just get mad at your husband, or something --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that never happens.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You know how you just kinda, you know, gotta have someone to call up and say, "Do you know what he did?".  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, my best friend, you know, I may have not -- not have talked to her in months, but, as soon as I pick up the phone it's like, I just talked to her yesterday, or just saw her yesterday, so ...
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah, you got that connection going with ... [SIGH] um ... just --
R:  Yeah, and -- and the older you get, the harder it is to make friends, you know, I mean, when you're younger, you know, you're always meeting new people, and --
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  -- and, you know, when -- when your kids are younger, you know, you -- you meet, ah, you know, people through your kids' friends, but, my kids are teenagers now, so, [SIGH] you know, it's [MN] you know [LAUGH], [MN] your -- your friends are, you know -- I mean, yes, you can make new friends, but it gets harder and harder -- well, of course you're not that active anymore, you know, I mean --
L:  Yeah.  [MN]
R:  -- you know, you're not quite that mobile, you know, going to soccer games and things like that, so ...
L:  I have an eleven year old, who's almost --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- twelve, so, he's at that -- you know, he's at that age, too, where, you know, I know the parents of some of his friends, and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and parents through the boy scouts and -- and other things that he's involved in, but [SIGH], you know, I'm -- and we're cl- -- we're friends with some of 'em, but, we're not really close to any of 'em, it's just -- you know, if you only see somebody once -- once a month or something --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- it makes it kinda difficult, but, I don't know -- I think those of us who go to college, that seems to be where most people make the most lasting friends.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  You know, I think. 
R:  Yeah, well, I -- I guess I have a couple of friends from high school --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, um, yeah, um, my goodness, yeah, I -- I have, ah, you know quite a few friends from, ah, college, too [SIGH], yeah, and ah, it -- it's -- it's re- -- well, I -- I -- I do- -- I grew up in -- in another city from where I live now --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- well, I -- I really always enjoy going home and visiting all my old friends, 'cause, ah -- ah, you know, I -- I just don't see them that often, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah, yeah, they're really quite important to me, and -- and, ah, I don't know -- it's really nice to see a familiar face now and then, it kinda [SIGH], um, kinda -- [SIGH] I -- I don't know, it kinda --
L:  Yeah, it makes you feel at home.
R:  Yeah, it makes you feel at home --
L:  Yeah, no, I -- I know.
R:  -- and, yeah, just, ah -- I don't know, just something -- ve- very special about that.
L:  I'm gonna have to call up, um, one of my good friends tonight who I haven't talked to in a while now, just thinking about it, 'cause I'm -- 
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm like, oh, I can call her anytime, you know, or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or, yeah, we'll get together, you know, this one is busy 'cause of the kids, and, you know, we'll wait to the summer, and then the summer gets busy, and you just --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you know, you keep thinking, "Oh, we'll do it sometime". 
R:  Yeah --
L:  But ...
R:  -- well, I have a really good friend who goes away, ah, to a lake, um, [MN] ah, pretty far away, so, I don't see her all summer, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, we're gonna be getting together next week --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- before she goes.
L:  That's good.
R:  Yeah, and you know, [MN] I really miss that, because, you know -- and when she's gone, you know, and [LAUGH] -- I mean, I -- I do have other friends, but, she's kind of --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- my best friend, so ...
L:  No, I understand.
R:  Yeah.  And, ah, yeah [SIGH], my goodness, friends are so special, um, you know, [inaudible] this -- this --
L:  I think people are in smaller families too these days, so, you don't have the family --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I -- I'm one of six, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we're all over -- we're scattered all over the country.
R:  Oh, yeah, [MN] yeah, well, um, a lot of my family are, um, in a couple of different cities, and -- and, ah, I live away from my family, and so, when holidays come around, it's, um -- it's really tough because, we -- we can't always afford to go back to -- to visit people for holidays, especially Christmas, so, we're usually here by ourselves and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, everyone else is with their family, and -- and, ah, that's really -- really hard -- hard at holidays, you know, and everybody's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- busy --
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  -- so ...
L:  When we first got married, um, we were living in, ah, a city and we had a -- had a lot of friends who were in similar situations -- were, you know, just starting out -- out --recently out of college and then couldn't afford to travel, or had to work over the holiday, so --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- they had a tradition they called the widows and orphans thanksgiving -- everybody who was still in town because they had to work, and didn't -- couldn't get away as a family was invited to -- over to their house -- they supplied the turkey --
R:  Oh, well, that's neat.
L:  -- everybody else brought, you know, a -- a side dish, or a dessert, or whatever, and it was a very eclectic group of people, you know?
R:  Oh, that's pretty neat.
L:  It was -- it really --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- we got to meet a lot of interesting people through that, because they had, you know, friends and they had people that they worked with -- I was -- I worked with, ah, the husband --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so, that's how we knew them, but [NOISE] ...
