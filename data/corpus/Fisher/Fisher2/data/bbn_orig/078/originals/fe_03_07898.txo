L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  My name's Amber.
R:  My name is Scott.  Hi, Amber.  I'm Scott.
L:  How are you?
R:  I'm fine.  So, uh, [SIGH] if an anonymous benefactor offered me a million dollars o- only[?] to not speak to my best friend ever again, would I take it?  Hm, [SIGH] initially I would say yes, 'cause I could really use the money but, uh, I'm not sure I would be able to do that.  I mean, I hold friendship very dear.
L:  Right, right.  Yeah, I mean, I -- personally, I'd probably look for some kind of a loop hole.  Like, well would I be able to stay in touch with, um, like by emailing them or in writing or whatever?  And just couldn't talk to them or like if I really couldn't have anything to do with them I don't think I'd be able to do it.
R:  Yeah, yeah. 
L:  You know.
R:  [SIGH] Well, yeah, and looking for a loophole that would be good.  Yeah, 'cause he did, you know, it does specifically say that you can't talk to them.
L:  Right.
R:  But, you know, some people consider any form of communication, you know, they use the general term, "talk".  
L:  Right.
R:  Um, uh, it's a good question. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Uh --
L:  It's interesting -- yeah, I mean, it's interesting they chose a million dollars just that's so much money like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah, yeah, I mean, you could literally not work for at least twenty to twenty five years --
L:  Right.
R:  -- depending on how you live.
L:  Right.
R:  Off of a million dollars, so --
L:  Right, right.
R:  Uh, [SIGH] wow.
L:  So, it's sort of -- I mean, the whole idea of it's kind of creepy though.  You know, like why on earth   I -- I mean, if the person's anonymous you'd never find out, you know, who they are but like why someone would pay someone to not speak to their friends just doesn't make any sense.  I would feel like the money was coming from some sort of like deranged, evil person.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I mean, i- if it -- if it's true, I mean, does it really matter where the money's coming from?
L:  I think it would matter because like you might be willing to sacrifice something important to you, you know, for monetary gain if it felt like it was also somehow, like supporting a good cause.  You know what I mean?  Like when people donate a kidney or whatever --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like they're making this huge sacrifice but they know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that it's going to help do something positive.
R:  True.
L:  This just seems like, you know, it's somehow encouraging some sort of like depraved anti social [LAUGH] whatever.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah, or, you know, or if it's drug money or, you know, money, uh, gathered from some other illegal activity.  You know, I think I might question that as well.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, [SIGH] I know some people who probably wouldn't question that but, you know, then again they would probably just immediately answer, "Yes", to the question.
L:  Right.
R:  So --
L:  Right.
R:  It's, uh 
L:  Right, it's definitely tempting.  I mean --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  It's tempting.  I -- I think for less money it probably wouldn't be so tempting but like you said, a million dollars is enough to like really transform your life.  You know.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I mean, I could -- I could definitely put a million dollars to use.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah. [SIGH]
L:  Yeah. 
R:  But I -- yeah.  I think that might be a little too high of a price.  And it's --
L:  Yeah, I think so.  I think so.
R:  And that -- that's a really hard choice at least for me.  But [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's really weird.  It's -- I don't know.  I don't know who came up with these topics that we're [inaudible] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- to talk about but it's just kind of bizarre.  Um, yeah, I also think it's weird, you know, that it's like specifically your best friend.  You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  You know, 'cause there's definitely like plenty of friends I have that I'd be perfectly happy to not talk to again --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- for some small amount of money [LAUGH] or even, you know, whatever.  But, um, yeah, but your best friend is like horrible.  You know, they might as well have said your mother [LAUGH] like.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  On the other hand, you know, if you're the -- if you're the type of person who, let's say, has, uh, moved around a lot, you know, hasn't really had time to develop a, you know, a real close friendship with anybody --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, you know, I mean, not talking to your best friend at the time, you know, you might've only known them a couple of months.
L:  Right.  Well, yeah.
R:  That may not be so difficult.
L:  I know.  That's true and the truth is that like at various times, you know, in life you might have someone who is your best friend at the time who like a couple of years later you wouldn't be in touch with them anyway because, like you said, you moved or something changed or you had a falling out.  So --
R: Yeah.
L:  You know, in that case like, you know, just it might happen anyway.  So -- Yeah, of course --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You could split the money with the person.  You know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, you could approach them and just say, "Look, you know, here's the situation.  We have to agree to not talk forever but we've got a million dollars that we could share".  Like that would be -- I don't know that would feel a little bit less corrupt to me.  And then you could sort of decide together.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  That's -- that's a -- that's an interesting way to look at it.  I never thought about that.
L:  Yeah.  Do you wa- -- do you watch the show Friends?  The TV show.
R:  No, I don't.
L:  Oh, 'cause there was this episode of the TV show where like, um, basically this one guy, Ross, is gonna marry this woman and -- but she couldn't really deal with him being really close with his ex girlfriend.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so basically she said, "Look" -- they broke up temporarily and she said, "Look, the only way I am gonna get back together with you is if you promise not to talk to her again 'cause I just can't really deal with you continuing to be such close friends with your ex girlfriend if you're gonna be with me".
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so basically he couldn't decide what to do and he asked all his other friends and all of his other friends couldn't decide what he should do.  You know, they didn't know what to tell him so eventually he like went to his friend and said to her, "Look, here's the situation I'm in.  Like basically I'm definitely gonna lose one of you".  You know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And she basically said, "I think you should go ahead and marry her because like you can be friends with lots of people and you have lots of friends but, you know, you only can find one person really to spend your life with".  But then he couldn't go through with it.
R:  Wow.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That -- that's a true friend.
L:  Right.  Well --
R:  That's --
L:  Well, I mean, I think he was still in love with her which was the point but, you know, that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, and it was also -- I think it made him -- like he understood where his future wife was coming from in making the demand but, you know, like obviously he understood why it bothered her that he was so close with his ex girlfriend but he also -- I think it made him like think badly of her that she would even ask him to not have anything to do with her.
R:  Right --
L:  You know.
R:  Right.
L:  Because it was so extreme.  It wasn't like, "Look, I'd like if you didn't, you know, spend time alone with her", or whatever.  It was like, "You can't ever contact her again".
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I think that made him realize that like it just wasn't, you know, she wasn't for him.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  And, you know, the -- the -- this hypothetical question also brings up, uh, you know, the -- the more general question, "What would you do for a million dollars?"
L:  Right.
R:  You know, like the movie Indecent Proposal.
L:  Right, right.
R:  You know, I mean, would -- would you sleep with a total stranger for a million dollars?
L:  Right.  No, well that -- to me that's like --
R:  You know.
L:  You know, just so gross.
R:  Oh, I agree.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I agree.  I mean, my wife would kill me. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  But the -- the -- the whole idea, you know, behind, you know, w- what are you willing to do for anything else?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah, well it becomes gambling.  You know, it's just all a form of gambling 'cause it's like you're risking something --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- in the hope that your life will end up being better because that money that came into it.  But obviously you gave something up, you know, it's a huge risk.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, yeah.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Plus I mean a million dollars is like so tempting but, you know, I mean, i- if you played your cards right obviously it could really transform your life but it's not really enough money in today's world to like give you everything you've ever wanted forever.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that's true.  I mean, I -- granted a million dollars is a lot of money but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, eventually it will run out and then what do you do?
L:  Right.
R:  You know, and --
L:  And assuming this is some sort of legitimate enterprise the government would take half of it in taxes [LAUGH] anyway.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah, so 
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow. [SIGH]
L:  So, what's the first thing you would buy?
R:  What is the first thing I would buy?
L:  Yeah.
R:  A new car.
L:  A new car?
R:  A new car, definitely.
L:  That would be a good thing.
R:  I mean, I drive a ninety eight Corolla --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and it's -- it's got almost a hundred thousand miles on it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I mean, it's -- it's a Toyota.  It's gonna run forever but, you know, it's -- it's not gonna
