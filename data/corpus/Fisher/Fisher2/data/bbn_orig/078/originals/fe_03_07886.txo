L:  Hello, this is Julie.
R:  Hi, Julie, this is Da- uh, Michele.
L:  Hi.
R:  Huh.
L:  This is my first call so I --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- don't know.
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  Have you done this before?
R:  Yes, I have, okay.
L:  Okay.
R:  Well, just, you know, we just kinda talk and let me know what you think about, um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] -- I would not take the million dollars.
L:  [MN]
R:  Would you take the million dollars?
L:  [SIGH] Well, no, except I do have to take because, uh, I've had to try friendships recently, test them I should say, which I never wanted to do but, uh, you know, call up on favors and what not and you learn that, uh, some of your closest friends are fair weather friends.
R:  Right.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, but, uh, it does remind me of a story that, um, [LIPSMACK] I -- I used to work in Connecticut and I live in New York City and so at one point the Lotto in -- in Connecti- -- [MN] like, I don't know, it was like, seventeen million dollars.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, one of the guys I worked with was -- was driving a bunch of people back to the city after work [LIPSMACK] and he stopped so someone could jump out and buy Lotto tickets for everyone and then they had the discussion, you know, would you, um, take the money from me?  Since you -- something about, like, you leant me the dollar but would you split it with me and the guy driving the car said, "Absolutely, your friendship is without a doubt not worth the Lotto money".  Huh.
R:  Mm.
L:  He was very blunt about it.
R:  Oh, that's weird.
L:  It's like, wow, that hurts man! [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah, that does hurt.
L:  So --
R:  Yeah, it d- -- I guess it -- right, it depends on what level of friendship you have with a certain person, you know, I mean, that the friend I'm thinking of, I've known her forever.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I know that she would, uh, she would not take the million so I would -- I think I would die if she did say she would take the million.  As a matter of fact this weekend when I see her I'm going to ask her. [LAUGH]
L:  Same question, yeah.
R:  Yeah, see what her --
L:  But --
R:  -- see what her opinion is, but, um, I really don't believe that she would, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- she would take the money.  [LIPSMACK] But, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [inaudible] that million dollars is a lotta money.
L:  Yeah, and it also depends on your -- what your financial situation is too.
R:  Right, true.  That's true.
L:  Um, I know that it's a more -- that question tries my ethics more today than it did two years ago.
R:  Mm.
L:  'Cause I -- 'cause the money situation.
R:  Okay.
L:  You know, like it -- it would make me think a nanosecond longer [LAUGH] about it.
R:  So you would -- you would -- you would take the money?
L:  I would not but I would -- it -- I would be more tempted.  I -- I'd contemplate that it would be more appealing -- it sounds more appealing, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just because, gee, you know, I really could use that money.
R:  Oh yeah, I could use it too but, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't know, I don't know, friendship, you know, friendship is priceless I guess.
L:  Right, right.
R:  You know, depending on -- now if I didn't have anybody that I was really close to then I'd say, sure, you know.  Like say your husband was your best friend.
L:  Oh, well that would be like ruining your life.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I mean, that was like --
R:  Yeah, but you wouldn't have to --
L:  -- ruining your life, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, that was like --
R:  Yeah, but you wouldn't have to --
L:  -- why don't you just throw everything away for the money?
R:  You wouldn't -- yeah, but you wouldn't have to really classify him as a best friend, you could just say, "Well, he's my husband, he's not really --" you could pick somebody else that's not really your best friend! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Would, I mean, if this were reality I'd definitely suss[?] it out and [inaudible] if I didn't tell them who my best was and, you know, who -- how would they check?  Could I get around the rules?  I would always try to see if I could get around the rules.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, that's a thought, that's a thought.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's a good thought. [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  It usually goes --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  It usually goes pretty fast, you know, if we keep thinking about -- but yesterday's question was hard too.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So it is -- and this is -- this question here is like a yes or a no.  [inaudible] --
L:  How long do you, um, have you been doing these studies?
R:  Um, this is my third -- third one.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  My third -- my third study.
L:  And so what happens, for example I -- I have my calls forwarded from my -- my landline.  I prefer to use my landline but it just -- I didn't realize they were going to be calling today.  So, um, would it -- if I refused the call would I still be on the list?
R:  Um, sure, I think so, as long as it's not too many times.
L:  Right.
R:  I really don't know, you'd probably have to call and ask that one eight hundred number.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  But I know --
L:  So you think you'll be called more than three times?
R:  Oh yeah, they'll probably keep you on, you know, keep you on -- no, no, the -- like, this particular Fisher study is just three calls and then they might have another study and then you can parti- participate in that.
L:  Oh, you've done a few of these it sounds like.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And so do you have to keep signing on, keep -- just keep checking?
R:  Huh-uh, nope.
L:  Oh, you're in, you're in?
R:  You're in, you're in.
L:  And they're all phone studies?
R:  Yes, the ones I know of anyway.  But, anyway, to get back to the --
L:  Oh right, that's --
R:  -- million dollars, 'cause that's what we're supposed to do, talk about --
L:  Oh right.
R:  -- talk about [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the topic of the day and not [LAUGH] personal stuff I guess. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, sorry, we'll just stick --
R:  Well no, that's okay.  That's o- --
L:  We'll just stick to the call, right?
R:  Right.  But it's hard --
L:  Um --
R:  It's hard to make a ten minute conversation out of a yes or no, you know, answer --
L:  Yeah, it is pretty tough.
R:  -- unless you dwell on it and think about, "Well, yes, I'd say no.  And then, well, maybe I wouldn't say no, or maybe I'd say yes and, well, maybe I wouldn't say --" you know -- you know --
L:  Talk about all the possible scenarios.
R:  -- peop- -- right, if you think about it, if you think about it, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you'd be back and forth, like you said, you'd be back, "Oh, well, maybe I would, no, no, I wouldn't take it" you know, and then you'd think, oh --
L:  Could I get away with it?
R:  Yeah, right. [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, that kind of thing. Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  What --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH] Who th- -- who they consider my best friend, you know.  You know, did -- maybe I could pick --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- somebody that's a friend but not -- not my best friend, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  And how would they know who your best friend is, so?
L:  Exactly.  How would they monitor it, you know.
R:  Right, right.  So, it's all ...
L:  Yeah, what if you went --
R:  -- hypothetical.
L:  -- into the witness protection program?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, you know, you never know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- what could happen. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right.  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, but what about that movie, um, [LIPSMACK] what's that Demi Moore movie and Robert Redford?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  For a million dollars she slept with him?
R:  [NOISE] Oh, I don't know.  [NOISE] I don't know --
L:  It was exactly --
R:  I think -- you know what I think, it was on the other night, not the movie but talking about her, because of her new movie.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So maybe that was on.  They talked about some movie she made with Robert Redford, I never saw it so I don't know.  Did she -- did you see the movie?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, it ruined the marriage.
L:  Oh.
R:  They really needed the money, she did it.
L:  Oh okay.
L:  Ruined the marriage.
R:  Oh.
L:  And, uh --
R:  Did the --
L:  I don't know, it was interest- --
R:  Did the husband agree to it?
L:  He did but he like, as she was leaving he changed his mind.
R:  Oh.
L:  You know, "Wait, wait, I don't -- I'm, you know, we shouldn't --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- do this, blah blah".
R:  Huh.
L:  Um, and regretted it like, instantaneously.
R:  Oh okay.
L:  And the guy, Redford character, was, you know, was -- he was a millionaire and in love with her --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and so sh- he kind of finally woos her.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And, uh, in the end he just very arbitrarily, uh, without warning, dumped her and you find out later what she never learns is that [LIPSMACK] they ran into him that day and he s- -- you know, his chauffeur said, "What, you know, why'd you do that?" and Redford says, "She'll never look at me the way she looks at him".
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  And, uh --
R:  Wow, yeah.  Yeah, I guess it depends on, you know, the strength of a relationship and [LAUGH] -- I don't think -- I know my husb- --
L:  Can't buy love or happiness I guess.
R:  Yeah, I know.  I don't think my husband would go for that. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I guess it would depend on what the other guy looked like.
L:  He -- he say -- he said, "Just go get a part time job or something" [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know. [LAUGH]
R:  I'd say, "Now wait a minute here, a million dollars" [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- of course, I don't know if I could do it, I -- that would be --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the big question.  Yeah.
L:  But interesting questions, I -- I mean, I think the scenario that I was talking about before was, um, [LIPSMACK] a guy borrowed a dollar to buy a lottery ticket.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So then, you know, if you win with that borrowed dollar and you haven't yet paid back the dollar, do you split the money?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, and, you know, again, it -- the friendship does come into play there.
R:  Right.
L:  But --
R:  And if he was really a good friend -- I don't know if I'd split the money but I'd certainly give him something, you know what I mean?
L:  Right.  Take him [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'd buy dinner! [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, no, no, I mean something --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, not five hundred thousand but maybe -- maybe a hundred thousand, you know?
L:  Right, right.
R:  You know, take care of him some way.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, it depends, you know, it depends on the level of friendship, you know.  Of course, I -- I -- 
L:  Because I understand that lottery winners really their lives are not at all improved once they win.
R:  Right.
L:  I can't -- I don't l- --
R:  But I would like the -- yeah, I'd like to, uh, I'd like to, uh, prove them wrong! [LAUGH]
L:  You know, absolutely.  I could live a very well balanced life.
R:  Yes.
L:  Really. [LAUGH]  I'm positive.
R:  Yeah, I could too.  But then that's what those people say too.
L:  Yeah, I bet.
R:  But I think -- I think, uh, I think I could, I think I could be logical about it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I could, you know, handle it.  But who knows? [LIPSMACK]  So ...
L:  Yeah.  So does this call just end in ten minutes?
R:  Yeah, it [inaudible] gives you a little warning and then you say goodbye and then that's it and somebody --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- uh, 'cause something comes on and says, you know, "Your time is up, you have thirty seconds to say goodbye" and then you just say goodbye, but --
L:  Okay.  I just signed up yesterday, I was -- I didn't --
R:  Oh yeah?
L:  Yeah, I didn't think it would happen this quickly.
R:  M- yes, yeah, that happens. [LAUGH]  Yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they have lots of people studying on it.  So --
L:  Interesting.
R:  -- a million dollars, oh boy.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]  I'm working --
R:  I own a --
L:  -- for ten right now and they're asking me about a million dollars --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know! [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I'm not too much above that so, you know, that's --
L:  I know, let's put it in --
R:  -- where we're all at.
L:  Let's put it in perspective --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know.
R:  Right. [LAUGH]  Right.
L:  So
