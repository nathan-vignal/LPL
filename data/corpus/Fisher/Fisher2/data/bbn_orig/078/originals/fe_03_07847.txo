R:  Hi, my name's Holly.
L:  My name is Sabrina.
R:  Hi, Sabrina, how are ya?
L:  Fine.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay, well, I guess I'll go first.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, if I was paid a million dollars to leave the US I would probably go to France or somewhere in Europe and pursue my modeling career.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, that's about it.  What I would miss the most is the food I guess.  The food and the beaches.  I've never been to Europe, so I don't know --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- what to compare it to but ...  I don't know.  That's about it.
R:  Hm.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  What about you? [NOISE] 
R:  Um, I don't think I would do it --
L:  Really?
R:  -- first of all.  I wouldn't do it, it's not worth the money to me.  I -- I would love a million dollars.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I w- desperately, desperately could use a million dollars --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- to tell you the truth.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] ... mm, [SIGH] you know --
L:  But --
R:  -- it would solve so many problems in my life 'cause I need some start up cash to pursue my dream.
L:  Right.
R:  A- but --
L:  What is that?
R:  Um, I'm a musician.  A singer, songwriter and an actor.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  And, um, I, you know, write beautiful songs and sing beautiful songs and I really wanna make an album.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I have a style that's not exactly marketable, it's not pop, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's not, like, commercial, so --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- it might be a little bit hard for me to get backers.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I think I'm gonna have to, you know, do it myself.  But I know that if I -- once I have product I can generate an income and generate work, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  And that's like, my dream in life.  But would I leave this country for that money, you know?  I guess they mean like, never come back, you know.
L:  Well, yeah, when you put it that way, that wouldn't -- I don't --
R:  It's a million dollars but you can never come back here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I wouldn't do it because I would miss my family.
L:  Oh right.
R:  I -- everyone of my friends is here, my precious friends, my precious family, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I -- I left all of my friends and family, they all live in New York and I moved to Los Angeles four months ago --
L:  Oh wow.
R:  But -- yeah, but, um, I would -- I'd go back to -- I've already -- I've been here five months and I've already been back to visit twice, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, so you --
R:  I --
L:  -- miss them a lot.
R:  Plus I can call, you know, it's much cheaper, it's free to talk on the phone to New York when --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you have a cellphone, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  Um, it doesn't cost any extra, so I talk on the phone all the time to them.  It's just a point of my life, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't -- I'd have to learn and -- and I learned just from this move, 'cause I mean, I lived in New York my whole life, I've never done a big move, and this move was so hard on me, I can't imagine moving to some place with completely different culture and completely different language.
L:  Right.
R:  I'd have to, you know, this is taking six, nine months to adjust.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That would take, like, a year or two.  I don't think it's even worth a million dollars, you know?
L:  True.
R:  I guess I could --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- probably just work --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- eighty hours a day for the next --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- year and maybe make a million dollars, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  And be able to stay here.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And spare the adjustment of getting your stuff there, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Or leaving all your stuff behind.  My animal.  My animal's old so I -- she's a cat and she's sixteen, she would never make it, you know.
L:  Oh okay, yeah.
R:  Just everything, it w- -- it's undoable although very tempting.  I suppose I could go to ... you know, interesting places --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if I had to do it.
L:  Right.
R:  [LIPSMACK] I might go to India for a little while.
L:  Oh okay.
R:  I could definitely live in Mexico.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's just the most beautiful beaches in the world there.
L:  Right.
R:  Part of my dream is one day to have a house in Mexico.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.  Um, [MN] I could go to Canada which at least it's similar language and culture.
L:  Yeah, I've been there.
R:  Um, France does sound really nice.  I've -- I've never been to F- -- I've been to Europe but I haven't been to, you know, Spain, Italy --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of France, you know, the big -- the good ones. [LAUGH]
L:  Right! [LAUGH]
R:  I've been to, you know, Germany and England and Amsterdam --
L:  Oh really?
R:  -- and I've been to some of the eastern European countries.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And some of the Norwegian countries, Norway and, um, [LIPSMACK] Sweden.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  Yugoslavia when it was, you know, when it was called that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, Czechoslovakia.
L:  I -- I was gonna say that.
R:  Prague, um, which is Hungaria I guess, is that right?  Yeah.  So I've been around, you know.  And I've been to some of the actually -- I've been to like, Dominican Republic and Brazil as well, so you know, I guess it's nice to travel to those places.  I could probably settle ultimately in Europe I would think 'cause it's the most [LIPSMACK] -- most like America, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I definitely wouldn't wanna like, live in a country like, uh, Mexico or something where it's just --
L:  Yeah, I couldn't do that.
R:  -- so radically different from our culture.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, it -- or even India, you know.  I -- you could spend a year or two exploring those countries but like, just to spend --
L:  Really?
R:  -- the rest of your life there -- yeah.
L:  I don't think I would make it that long in India.
R:  Really?
L:  No.  Not a year or two.
R:  I think there's a lot to see, you know?
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, I would definitely love to visit.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But to stay in like, any -- I don't know, like the Middle Eastern countries or India, Africa, places like that, I don't think I could be there for too long.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Just because it's so different.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't think I would adjust well.
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I could see.
L:  I don't think so. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  What about your family or your friends?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, having to leave?
R:  Mhm.
L:  That would be really hard.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Extremely hard.  I didn't really think of it like that, but if I had to go I would pick France.  But if it came down to it, I don't think I would leave for a million dollars.
R:  Yeah.  I wouldn't --
L:  No.
R:  -- do it.
L:  Just having to leave everyone and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- never come back that -- that wouldn't be worth it at all.
R:  I mean, they don't say that [NOISE] so, you know -- which is interesting.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, [MN] part of what I learn in life is keep -- you know, to communicate very clearly.  So if it was just leave the US or the action of leaving, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they don't specify forever.  So say it was just like, for one day I have to leave the US, I just have to go to Mexico for five minutes and I can come back --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and get a million dollars, sure, I'd do it.
L:  Right.
R:  I'd do it tomorrow.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, wouldn't we --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- all.
R:  So m- you know, that's funny because say it was real 'cause it's a hy- -- they say it's a hypothetical --
L:  Right.
R:  -- situation.  If it was real and it was drawn up by a lawyer, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and it was phrased that casually, "I'll give you one million dollars to leave the US" then you would win in court, you know.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  You could go to Mexico for one minute.
L:  [LAUGH] And come right back.
R:  Come back and get your check.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  In which case, no problem.
L:  Right.
R:  No -- there would be no missing anything.
L:  Sure.
R:  I might even stay in Mexico a few days.
L:  I know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- have a little vacation and come back and get some money.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That would be nice.
R:  I'd even go to Europe.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I was just in England, um --
L:  Oh really?
R:  [LIPSMACK] In Scotland and Ireland.  I went -- I'm a singer and I went on tour, um, two months ago and I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just went for five days, uh, for seven days, I did five shows over there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So it was really fun.  It's really great to get out of America.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Even, you know, for a minute or a few weeks, um, [LIPSMACK] it reminds you -- it just really centers you like, it reminds you what's great about America.
L:  Right.
R:  It remi- -- you know, it's very convenient here, especially for food.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like you were saying you'd miss the food.
L:  Right.
R:  You can get any food you want here twenty four hours a day in most --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- cities, and in Europe it's a little harder to get like, a fresh vegetable sometimes.
L:  Really?
R:  It's a little more limited.  It's a little more limited I find.
L:  Okay.
R:  And restaurants, you know, everything is [LIPSMACK] a little more, um --
L:  Easy access out here.
R:  Mhm.  Here, yeah.
L:  Really?
R:  Definitely.
L:  Yeah, we can pretty much access anything we want [inaudible] --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Anything.
L:  For -- for the right price you can get whatever you want out here.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, if you have a million dollars too, you know, you can't live on that a long time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, too -- too crazily, but I guess you could probably get most of what you want and, you know, [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  But it is -- I notice it's a lot more expensive like, to go or- organic grocery store is so expensive.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  In Europe, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Here it's so cheap --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you can get organic vegetables even in like, a major department -- in a major supermarket.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, so it definitely --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- makes life inconvenient. [NOISE]
L:  Oh yeah. [SIGH]  Then I guess I will definitely stay here, a million dollars is not worth leaving --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- the US, it's a great country.
R:  [LAUGH] Although I wouldn't -- then again, when I think about it, the -- one of the good drawback- -- one of the good things about leaving, I wouldn't mind going to a country where I supported the politics more, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, I love this country but [LIPSMACK] I don't agree with, um, you know, that -- the war that our president's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- just, um, initiated.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't support his actions.  And, you know, the -- a government is supposed to -- at least here it's supposed to represent the people.
L:  The -- right.
R:  And it feels a lot better to be in a country where our government is doing -- is behav
