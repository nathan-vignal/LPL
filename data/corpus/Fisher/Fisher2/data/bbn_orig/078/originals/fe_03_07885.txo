L:  Hi, my name is Leila Verna.
R:  Hi, my name is Tania.  How are you?
L:  Pretty good.  Too hot for me. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I tell ya right now I've got ninety five up here.
L:  Yeah, it's supposed to -- well, I live in Ohio, it's supposed to rain this evening so we're keeping our fingers crossed.
R:  Oh really?  That's good.
L:  Okay, so our question was, w- would we give up our best friends for a million dollars.  Hm.
R:  Okay.  For a million dollars.
L:  Yes.  It's a lotta money but anymore it seems like everybody has a million dollars, you know what I'm saying?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You hear about all these lottery winners and a lotta times they don't seem happy to me.
R:  Yeah well, I tell you right now, if I had a million dollars, I don't know, I think maybe I would make new friends. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, but I mean, if you've had this friend -- I've never had a friend over, you know, like I've always had friends at high school --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I had a childhood friend --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but if I had a friend from childhood on --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that was my best friend and she knew all my secrets -- you've heard that saying, you know, "You're always gonna be my best friend 'cause you know all my secrets". [LAUGH]
R:  Well, my best friend's my mother.
L:  Ah.
R:  So, you know.
L:  Well, yeah, you can't lose her not unless --
R:  No.
L:  -- you know, you kill her or something really.
R:  No.  No.  That's true.
L:  Yeah, but I mean if -- if your friend has been with you pretty much your whole life or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a good part of it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [MN] the only way you can do it is literally, you know, insulting her so bad that --
R:  Hm.
L:  But no, if I had, you know, someone that was with me for that long --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't think money would be that important to me 'cause, uh, you have a friend, you have a -- usually they're friends for life.
R:  Well I think I would take the --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- million dollars and --
L:  [SIGH] --
R:  -- um, make sure that somehow she got some of it to use to make her life easier.
L:  Yeah, but like they said, you're gonna lose the -- you either -- you have the money or the friend.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So it's like either or.  It's like, ugh, I don't know.
R:  Yeah.  Well, see I --
L:  Yeah, I think if I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, if I was that way I could be happy with the million dollars.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But like I said, you've heard so many stories about --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- all these people winning the money --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they're absolutely miserable --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because what's the first thing relatives do when they know you got money?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Hands out.
R:  Well, you know, I think -- I have a lot of relatives and they're real, you know, we're real close and I think that if I had a million dollars we would be able to make our lives a lot easier and, you know, give to charities and --
L:  M- right, right.
R:  -- you know, just buy a home.  It w- -- it would just make life a lot easier.
L:  Yes.
R:  And, you know, I don't -- I don't have close friends, you know, I'm -- because I'm -- because I'm a student.
L:  Yeah, neither do I, like I said. [NOISE]
R:  So, but, you know.
L:  Sometimes I wish I could find old friends that I knew --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when I g- -- five, six years ago. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  But so you would definitely go for the money?
R:  I definitely would go for the money.
L:  Yeah, I'd have to think about it a little bit, how -- how true a friend she really was before I --
R:  Do you have -- do you have any, um, close friends that you would be, you know, not willing to give up for a million dollars?
L:  At the current time no because I moved away after high school and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I had all the -- I worked at Burger King for like, four years --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I had all these great friends and when I came back I couldn't find anybody.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So -- but if I could f- -- I think if I could find a -- a couple of friends I had from when I lived in -- yeah, I would seriously have to think about it.
R:  Well, are --
L:  Because --
R:  -- are you a millionaire?
L:  I wish! 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No I'm not, believe me, I wish I was sometimes.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But it would take -- yeah, it would h- -- I'd have to weigh the pros and cons for at least, I won't say a couple of days, but at least a day and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- depending on how good a friend she was and, you know.
R:  Yeah.  Now, I could see if it was a family member --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- you know, 'cause all friends do is get you in trouble.  But --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Some of 'em, yes.
R:  I can see if it was a family member now, you know, that would hands down no, but a friend, you know, a friend, you know, you -- throw, you know, as far as you could throw 'em, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, uh, I mean, some people do, I see some people they live with their friends, they're friends till they're ninety but, you know, every friend that I've had just never, you know, stuck like that, either they did something or our personalities just clashed or, you know, what not.
L:  Yeah.  Or there was that one little point about her that drove you nuts.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, you know --
L:  And [several inaudible words] what they do --
R:  A lotta people have --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- uh, male friends.
L:  Yes, I know, I do.
R:  Yeah, male friends.
L:  Sometimes for me it's just easier because male friends --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know what they want, they're either interested in sex, sports of --
R:  Or not.  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  Or it's like, yeah, you know, they're never gonna wan to [MN] borrow your clothes --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and never return 'em. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, and I --
L:  Not unless they're cross dressers. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah. 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  And I know my frie- -- if I had a really good friend and they're, you know, I come and told her, I said, you know, "I'm getting a million dollars but you know, I can't see you anymore".  You know what?  She'd probably -- she'd say, "Tania --"  If she's anything like me she'd say, "Take the million".
L:  Yeah.
R:  She'd said, "I love ya, take the million" you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  "Live your life to the fullest".
L:  Yeah but then -- then you're gonna feel kinda bad because she was such a true friend that she was willing to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- let you, you know, [MN]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  So yeah, there's kind of a guilt issue.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  How much guilt are you gonna feel too.
R:  But --
L:  It's like, oh jeez.
R:  -- you know, if she's anybody like me or she's a friend like me, you know, she's the same kind of person, she'd be like, "Tania, [LIPSMACK] let me give you my bank account number, slip a hundred thousand in there".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's what she'd be doing. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah!  Uh, h- -- "Pay a hundred dollars a month okay?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's like, wait a minute here!
R:  Yeah, oh yeah, I tell ya right now, so --
L:  I don't think I'm gonna tell her about the money.  First of all I'm just gonna say, you know, uh, "I've moved on in my life".
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, you know, I think I'd be so ex- happy about the money I think I'd take a ad out in the paper.  You know how all these people -- cards come into my -- my door and everything and --
L:  Yeah, that's what I'd be afraid of though 'cause --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's like, uh, you know, you'd have to have an armed escort everywhere you went.
R:  Do you ever notice nobody knows your name unless you got money?
L:  Mhm.  Yes.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  I'm sure before Bill Gates became a millionaire no one ever heard of it him it's like, "Who?"
R:  Yeah, well, he's not --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah, okay.  But I don't know --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I wonder if Bill Gates has any, uh, friends that he had to let go of because he became a millionaire?
L:  Yes, that would be a good, get People magazine or something to do that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We need to work for a magazine where we have influence.
R:  Oh okay.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, that --
R:  I don't know.
L:  I just -- like, I'd -- I'd have really, really have to think about 'cause like I said, it -- it depends on how good of a friend y- she's been and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- what you -- what you're planning -- well, I don't think what you have planning to do with the money should have anything to do with it but 
R:  Mhm.
L:  [inaudible] [SIGH] --
R:  Well see, a lotta people nowadays, you know, they have to live life to the fullest.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And if you have friends --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- that you just absolutely can't let go of, that's fine, but if you do, just go for it, I tell ya.
L:  Yeah.  'Cause there was a -- a hundred other people you can always bump into and make a new friend but --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- but then you're always gonna have in your mind, "I've got a million --"
R:  Mm.
L:  "-- dollars, is he my -- he or she my friend --"
R:  That's true.
L:  "-- because of the money or --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You have to go around dressed like a bum, you know.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  For -- for a little while and then [MN], um, drop the bomb on him like The Bachelor or whatever.
L:  Yes! [LAUGH]
R:  "Yeah, ma'am --"
L:  Oh!
R:  "-- I'm poor" --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and then drop the bomb, you know.
L:  Or like that one show, the first, um, Survivor --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- where the guy was, uh, gay.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And now he's got all that money.
R:  Mm.
L:  And he had all that trouble with his foster son, remember they took the foster son away and everything?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And now they gave the foster son back because he's got all that money.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, that wasn't because --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of the money, uh-huh, right.
R:  Well you know what typically, um, happens?  When you get, uh, a million dollars and you have friends or whatever?  That sometimes they'll -- they'll flock to you.
L:  Yes.
R:  But on other times they shy away because they think that you're better than them now.
L:  Or yeah, that they -- they think that you think you're better than them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's what they think.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I mean, it could be as little as five or ten thousand dollars.
L:  Yes, yeah.  She's got her -- her f- -- her b- -- her nose so far up her behind --
R:  You know, she can't --
L:  -- she won't be my friend anymore.
R:  -- see the light of day.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, she won't be my friend no more.
L:  Yeah.
R:  All this other stuff and so -- but I don't know.
L:  Yeah, that's --
R:  I j- -- I guess I just have to see and see how it comes along and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I wanna know who'll be giving me a million dollars, I guess -- what would it be, the lottery ... [LIPSMACK] or -- I don't know.
L:  Yeah, pretty much the lottery.  Unless you --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, you send away for something with a coupon or something.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Because five or six years ago I did --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- buy some High C. with cou- -- a coupon.
R:  Mhm.
L:  On sale at the store.  And I won a year's supply of High C.
R:  Wow.
L:  And that -- believe me, that saves a lotta money when you don't have to buy it [LAUGH] for a year!
R:  I tell you right now --
L:  [SIGH] Oh, it's like, whoa!
R:  -- I don't know, with the million dollars, let's see, what could we buy?  Um, with a million dollars, you know, you'd have to pay the taxes on it.
L:  Yeah, and that would cut it down to what, maybe --
R:  About seven fifty.
L:  Yeah, seven fifty a half.
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  But the first thing I would buy is a house, most definitely.  And then that might let friends flock to me, yes! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I'd have a house built so beautiful like one- -- the ones they have down in Louisiana.  [SIGH]  I don't know if you've ever been there but ...
L:  I've seen pictures and my sister lives in, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- Georgia.  Peach  --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- not Peach Tree City but my dad lived there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, she lives in one of the upper, you know, we have our noses up our behinds --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- part of Georgia! [LAUGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well --
L:  Yeah. [SIGH]
R:  We recently had, uh, a lottery winner here, uh a --
L:  [LIPSMACK] In Louisiana?
R:  No, no, no, this is, uh, this is South Carolina.
L:  Oh.
R:  But, um, she -- she was the first time ever playing.
L:  Ooh.
R:  And she won.  It was ten million dollars or something and I don't know if she kept all her friends, you know, she was in high school or college.  I don't know if she'd been willing --
L:  Well she was pretty young then.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know if she'd been willing to give up one of her friends for that money.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, you know, they -- they were very, um, poor, you know and stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And her family.  I mean, I bet, you know, she'd be like, "Okay, I have ten friends, which one can I cut loose?"  She'd be like, "Yeah, I gotta support my family, I got my children to think of" if she had children, you know, nowadays they start --
L:  I --
R:  -- real young.
L:  I know, that's so s- horrible.
R:  So --
L:  Jeez.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I mean, yeah, 'cause it's like you gotta wonder -- 'cause I know I lived in Kentucky for like, six months, when my --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- dad and my stepmother, we all moved down there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I remember I went into a cave and there was an actual glacier still in that cave.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That I thought was so cool, it was like, "Wow, nature, it hasn't even melted the glacier yet" now it's
