R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.  Hello.
R:  Who's that?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hello.
L:  I'm Molly from Ohio.
R:  Molly, from Ohio --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'm -- I'm Robin, uh, from New York.
L:  Mhm.  So, time travel, that's a pretty, um --
R:  Yes, indeed.
L:  -- [inaudible] thing.
R:  Yes.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Why don't I -- ladies first -- why don't I let you start with this?
L:  One thing I could change.  Um, well this is something I've said recently and I usually don't think about things like that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but, um, it was [NOISE] to get to know my grandparents better --
R:  Right.
L:  -- before they died.  You know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- what I mean --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because my grandma recently passed away and I just, um -- [LIPSMACK] we were going through some of her things and she had, uh, taught in Kentucky in a one room schoolhouse and then later taught, like -- when they first desegregated the schools and, like -- I don't know, just all this crazy stuff and I just didn't appreciate her for what she could have taught me when I was younger because she's been, like, incoherent pretty much for, like, ever since I was, you know, able to have good conversations --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but, um, that's about it and I just -- I'm kind of fascinated with my -- my grandparents and I have this obsession with old things and antique stores and things like that which I kind of think stems from that kind of -- you know -- I don't know -- connection with your ancestors, maybe, I don't really know, but ...
R:  Right, well, uh, that -- to -- that actually reminds me of my, um, grandfather, uh, who, um, um, lived most of his life in India --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- he was a military, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- man, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, uh, having been to, uh, uh -- I lived in India for about three years --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, but, uh -- and I went to various places that he lived, um -- in India, you know the British were, you know -- didn't like the heat too much --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so they had their summer houses, but the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Indian -- uh, the Indians -- they were not allowed to build houses and so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they got around it by building, um, houseboats, beautiful houseboats --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- on -- on Lake Dow[?] --
L:  Are you British?
R:  Yes, yes -- beautiful houseboats on Lake Dow in the -- in the, uh -- on these lakes with the Himalayas rising out of them, but I wish that I had, um -- when I lived in India, I wish -- I wished he'd still been --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- alive because he could have taught me so much about India and showed me.  He, uh -- he lived there for about thirty years.
L:  How old were you when you lived there?
R:  Um, I was, uh, in my thirties.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And, um, I, uh -- it would have been fascinating to have been, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, with him there because --
L:  In India when you were at that age because you could understand things.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Absolutely --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so that -- that would have -- that would have been exciting because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he -- he knew a number of the Maharajahs, Maharanis --
L:  Oh gosh.
R:  -- so, um -- and, um -- and, uh, government officials and so on and so forth, he knew them --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- quite well, he was a -- he was a very senior, um, military man.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, that would have been fascinating and of course --
L:  Wow, that is amazing.
R:  -- yeah, and he was in Pakistan and, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, uh, Afghanistan.  Um, you know, the British tried to rule just about every country [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, if they could --
R:  -- in those days.  So, uh, if he's been alive, uh, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I -- I mean, I had no thoughts of going to India whilst he was alive --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I went there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, uh, doing a job for three years.  Um, but I -- uh, oh, uh -- at the time when he was alive, um, he was a -- a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- very good friend of Czar Nicholas of Russia --
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  -- and, um -- so we had many discussions about that.  But I've never --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- been to Russia, but I wish we had talked more about India and wish he'd still been alive.
L:  O- oh, my gosh, right --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- yeah, that is something I would be obsessed with, because just, like, as I'm getting older I am just really amazed just, like [NOISE] -- you know, history and like the his- -- you know, uh, how colonialism has affected the world 'cause it's still -- like, the repercussions are just so intense right now.
R:  Absolutely, that's right --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- absolutely.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, there we are, that was a -- that was a  -- th- that's something that I really would have enjoyed but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- he's be- he's been, uh -- he died many, many years ago.
L:  How old are you, if you don't mind me asking?
R:  Uh, fif- uh, fifty eight.  Um --
L:  How -- so when was Czar Nichol- Nicholas in power, 'cause, like, I'm trying to think, like --
R:  Well, uh, in the -- in --
L:  -- just for my own --
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  Just for my own, like, you know, chronological order, to --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- put this in my brain [NOISE] --
R:  Well, it --
L:  -- what year would that have been?
R:  Well, in the -- in the, uh -- you know, it was sort of nineteen, um -- in the ninet- -- early nineteen hundreds.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, uh, he was a friend of his 'cause he was in Ru- -- he was a diplomat too, so he --
L:  Wow! 
R:  -- tra- traveled a great deal. [MN] He was a very fascinating man and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I -- I -- I actually would have liked to have lived in those days because, um, life was so elegant then.  You know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if you -- if you were, uh, you know, in -- in the -- in -- in the military --
L:  Upper class.
R:  -- yeah --
L:  Or if -- if you were -- yeah, with him because he, you know -- but, wow.
R:  Yeah, I mean, he used to drive his own, uh, horse and carriage, you know --
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  Uh --
L:  He didn't write memoirs or anything?
R:  Uh, no.  He -- he had a lot of notebooks which I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which I've read, um, but didn't -- didn't really write any memoirs.  But he -- I remember a photograph of him, um, being, uh, taken to, uh, Buckingham Palace in -- in a carr -- horse and carriage, um, or horses and carriage, to be honored with, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- by -- by the, uh, king -- 
L:  Wow!
R:  -- king at that time.  So, that was fascinating but we nev- -- we never talked enough about all of this --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, because he certainly had stories that I -- he fought in -- he fought in the Boer War in South Africa, uh --
L:  [NOISE] Oh, my gosh.
R:  The first World War and the second World War, he was quite a well known fellow.
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  Yeah.  So, what else with you, anything?
L:  Um --
R:  How old are you, Molly?
L:  I'm twenty four.
R:  Uh --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- a spring chicken. [LAUGH]
L:  That's funny.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, yeah, well this is definitely the most interesting phone call ever --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's really amazing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, [LIPSMACK] well, yeah, the last person I talked from -- to was from New York too and we talked about, you know, how much the subway was and stuff [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, really, yeah.
L:  But, um -- cou- -- well -- wow, yeah, I don't know, I -- regrets -- I mean, I wish I wasn't -- you know, I guess I'm a little young maybe but not, I mean, adolescent -- that's just, ugh, why did I act that way?
R:  Mm.
L:  I don't know. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  But, I guess, I don't know -- there are so many other aspects of how much time travel that I would like to -- I don't know.
R:  Well, 'cause New York, you know, if one -- i- i- you know, that New York was of course, was, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- fascinating, um, in a -- in the days --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of the beginning of the automobile and -- and --
L:  [NOISE] Mm.
R:  -- and horses and carriages and seeing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, if one goes to the, uh -- the city of New York Museum --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, one sees all these wonderful --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- photographs and, uh, uh, of how New York was when it was being built, you know, whether it was the Queensborough bridge or the Brooklyn bridge or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- all that sort of -- or the -- or the, uh, Empire State building, things like that, which was -- which would have been fascinating -- still an elegant life then, you know.
L:  Oh, definitely.
R:  Much different -- [LAUGH] it's not so fast paced as it is today.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, have you been to New York?
L:  Yes, I have.
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  I live, you know, in Ohio and we're pretty close --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I've visited lots of times, my best friend lives in Astoria --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, um -- yeah, it's -- it's awesome.  I mean, I -- I personally -- the more -- be -- as I get old -- as I get older I'm definitely, like, a country girl, like, I --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- crave quiet and -- right now I'm living in the -- in the city and it's like, "Oh my gosh, people be quiet" [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- just -- you know.  So, I am, like, all about rivers and trees right now --
R:  Right, right.
L:  Um, [SIGH] but --
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, er, uh, th- that sounds interesting about your, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- grandmother.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I mean, it's just a small -- you know, it was just [NOISE] like, a solid Christian woman kind of thing, you know what I mean, just like --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- down home, like, American -- quiet, like -- you know, the -- the pastor wanted me to, like, recall memories -- like, really I didn't even have memories -- like, I -- maybe it's because I was too young or something but --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- i- i- if she was just like [NOISE] a -- a -- a normal American -- but she never, you know, said anything about, like, racism -- but I wonder if she did have, like, certain -- like, prejudices 'cause her hus- -- or her brother's still alive and I talked to -- to him and his wife and they're fascinating I'm going to go down to Louisville actually and visit them.  But, um --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- this summer --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but, um -- like, she has, you know, said the N word and stuff and --
R:  Oh, really.
L:  -- and I'm just, like, "Okay, well, uh, you're, you know, a lot older than me", I'm sure it's like a totally different look -- take on it and -- and I'm --
R:  Right.
L:  -- ready for whatever, but, yeah, I just, like, my grandpa was, like -- grew up in a working class Italian neighborhood and, um, he -- or at his funeral, some of his friends were talking about some gang that they were in, and it --
R:  Oh, really
L:  -- was, like, the blacks against the Italians, like, fighting over their, um -- their, uh [SIGH] nei- -- their junkyard terri- -- it was, like, their territory was, like, the junkyard and they're, like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- literally shooting each other over it --
R:  Oh, really.
L:  -- and -- and this was, like -- and this was in Cleveland in probably the thirties, which --
R:  Right.
L:  -- wouldn't be very elegant but --
