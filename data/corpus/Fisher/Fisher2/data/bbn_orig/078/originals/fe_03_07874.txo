L:  Hello.
R:  Hi there.
L:  Hi, how are you doing?
R:  Good, and you?
L:  I'm doing quite well, what's your name?
R:  I'm Samantha.
L:  Hello, my name is Stephen.
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  Nice to meet you too.  Where --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you, uh, calling from?
R:  Uh, Dallas, Texas.
L:  Oh, I'm in Huntington Beach, California.
R:  Oh, great.
L:  [LAUGH] How's the weather there?
R:  Uh, pretty hot, it's been, uh, quite humid, the rain's going to come in, I guess. [LAUGH]
L:  Same here.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's pretty hot and humid here --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, um, what would you do differently in your -- uh, if --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you had to change something in your life?
R:  Um, I guess it would be to, uh, have not worked for family. [SIGH]
L:  Really, why is that?
R:  Extremely stressful. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It causes, uh, a huge amount of stress on the family 'cause you can't -- tend to bring it home a lot more. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [NOISE] So -- and you?
L:  Uh, uh let's see now [LIPSMACK] -- probably, uh, if I went back into high school probably, um, [LIPSMACK], um -- you kind of regret it, uh, later on in life, but, um, I put somebody in the hospital.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  [LIPSMACK] What happened was, um, [LIPSMACK] he, um, attacked a girl and the girl was vi- visibly in, um -- upset, was crying -- beat her to a bloody pulp and then I guess my emotions got the best of me and I, um, had it out with him and, um, pretty much put him, um, in the hospital for, like, a week --
R:  Goodness.
L:  -- and just basically my emotions got the best of me and I was trying to defend her and tried to help her out and tried to protect her and I guess. [LIPSMACK] Uh, when he got out of hospital he moved and he was, um, afraid of all of us. [LAUGH]
R:  Fair enough but considering the circumstances --
L:  But, I'm not really --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a violent person --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so I wish I could have, um, just not done that and, um -- I mean, it -- it was in high school and high school kids are immature but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, you've got to be grown up about things.
R:  True, very true.
L:  So, um, is this your second call or is this your first, or ...?
R:  First --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- first call. [LAUGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK] This is my second call on the line.
R:  Okay.  Yeah,  I've, uh -- a friend of mine at work [NOISE] suggested this, I figured, "Heck, for a couple of bucks, why not?" [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, why not? [NOISE]  For --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- some cash, that's -- that's all that matters in life, basically --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- nowadays, is money --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- which sucks.  Are you calling from home or are you ...?
R:  Yes.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Uh, okay. [LIPSMACK] So, what do you like to do for fun?
R:  Uh, believe it or not, I've got, uh, more hobbies than I can count.  Um, I tend to do a lot of sewing and cross stitch and those type of things.  Go camping every now and then and try and do that about once or twi- twice a season, at least. [NOISE]
L:  Oh.
R:  So -- and yourself?
L:  Pretty much, um -- going up to Hollywood --
R:  Oh, nice.
L:  -- um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- pretty much hang out with, uh, my friends and lay by the pool and swim and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, just enjoy --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, going to the movies and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- stuff like that.
R:  Yes. [NOISE]
L:  Fun stuff, at least.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] And there's a couple of good movies out that I'm going in to try and -- get out and try and watch.  It's just a case of getting off of work to -- early enough to go.
L:  What movies are you interested in go seeing?
R:  Uh, uh, virtually anything I'll watch is -- I'm into anything from comedies to, um, action -- virtually everything in between unless it's real stupid comedy then I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- usually won't watch it but --
L:  Like Jackass? [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH] Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  I don't -- I have no interest seeing that it's stupid.
R:  That's for sure.
L:  Who is going to be willing to tape -- videotape themselves hurting each other? [LAUGH]
R:  Strangely enough a colleague of mine her son does that nearly every day of his life. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, my god.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Whoa, is that a -- is that a airplane or something?
R:  Yeah, I -- I live near the airport.
L:  Oh, wow, [MN] so, you hear airplanes all the time?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Does it ever wake you up?
R:  Strangely -- uh, you kind of get used to it.  Um, don't -- I normally don't hear them.
L:  That's cool.
R:  So --
L:  [LAUGH] So, um, your friend got you interested in doing the Fisher study, huh?
R:  Yeah.  Her and her husband, uh, tried it and found out that they actually do send you the money. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.  Did --
R:  So --
L:  -- do they try and enroll other people?
R:  Yeah, we've got a couple of people at work doing it now and, um, they all seem to be getting benefits out of it so --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- it at least works.
L:  Well, you -- you know, you can, like, put out -- put out flyers and -- and hand out -- how -- hand it out to people and that way when you recruit people you can make extra money.
R:  Yes, exactly.
L:  That's what I've done.
R:  Yeah, we've, um -- our -- the office I'm in is kind of sizing down right now, so not many of those people are going to get on but maybe my friend [NOISE] she works in a different office --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- maybe she'll be able to get more of the colleagues into it.  So --
L:  Yeah, I've already gotten fifteen people to do this already.
R:  Well, that's great.
L:  And I've already seen, um [LIPSMACK] -- I've already seen my first money already.
R:  Well, that's great.
L:  So, it's pretty cool trying to get --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- my goal is to get twenty more people.
R:  That'd be great.
L:  That way I could get more money. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes. [LAUGH] Strangely enough, no matter how much money you've got, you always need more. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I'm not --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- too greedy but I'm -- I'm enough greedy to be --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- happy with it. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Don't want to be, like -- like, superficial about money --
R:  True.  But it's always nice to have some extra cash to buy something.
L:  Oh, yeah --
R:  So ...
L:  -- or treat somebody out or something.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, are you -- are you married or are you single or --
R:  Yes, I'm married.
L:  Uh.
R:  Yes.
L:  For how many years?
R:  Uh, three years.
L:  Wow.  Two more you've got five.
R:  Yep. [LAUGH]
L:  Seven, you got ten more -- you got ten years then --
R:  Yeah, apparently --
L:  -- that's because --
R:  -- there's a seven year itch down here in Texas, so I'm trying to avoid that like the plague. [LAUGH]
L:  There's a seven year itch?
R:  Yeah, apparently most people down here get divorced at seven years. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my god.
R:  [LAUGH] I find it scary there's a statistic about that. [LAUGH]
L:  That is, uh, alarming.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Jeeze, people here just manage, like, five years and they get to call it quits.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's, uh, whoa -- when I get ma- --
R:  So, are you --
L:  Huh?
R:  Are you married or single or --
L:  Um, I'm very much spoken for, I'm not married but I'm very much spoken for.
R:  Okay.
L:  I mean, girls trying to get with me but I'm all -- you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] I'm -- I'm proud of it.
R:  Is that her in the background?
L:  [NOISE] Hold on --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I'm doing some study.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- yeah, that's, um -- [LIPSMACK] that's like everybody --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, um, my house has, like, an open door --
R:  Okay. [LAUGH]
L:  I'll talk to you in, like, three minutes.  So, um, yeah, it's like -- my house has like a, uh, open door policy -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- basically people wander in and out all the time --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and so I'm always -- I mean, if I'm -- if I'm at work and if no -- if, uh -- the last person that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- leaves the place, make sure you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- lock up the place. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't want strangers in my house, I just want -- I -- I -- I -- you guys can come in. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Basically my parents come in and check out about me and see how I'm doing.  My girlfriend's family comes in and, um, do -- do whatever they want.  It's kind of funny 'cause, um, I have a refrigerator full of food and, uh, like, um, Pepsi, which is, like, my -- one of my favorite drinks --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, like, with what I'm doing, pretty much when I get home there's, like, uh -- there's a few missing and I'm all, "Well, what happened?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, my girl -- my girlfriend's a -- uh, she's all, "Well, my mother just came in here and just, um, kind of raided the refrigerator and took, like, a -- a couple and -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm all, "Hey, how about she goes to the grocery store once in a while?"  I mean, don't get me wrong, I mean, I'm very --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- +hospitable -- hospitality, um, orientated, but, come on now --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you go into some guy's refrigerator and you take, like, the absolute good stuff --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- from -- from his refrigerator?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Please restock it, you know.
R:  Well --
L:  Try to -- try to go back to, um, when --
