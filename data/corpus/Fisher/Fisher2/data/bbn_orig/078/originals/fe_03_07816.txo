R:  [LIPSMACK] Hello?
L:  Hello, I'm Karen.
R:  I'm Mary Kay.
L:  Hello, Mary.  Where are y- --
R:  How are y- --
L:  What area are -- are you from?
R:  I'm from Mississippi.
L:  Oh, I'm from Illinois.
R:  Okay.
L:  So this is nice.
R:  Yeah.  How are you today?
L:  [SIGH] It's very warm here.  I imagine --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's warm there too. [MN]
R:  Yes, it is. [LAUGH]  It's not as bad as it usually is this time of year here though, so --
L:  Oh really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well that's good.
R:  Kind of enjoying that.
L:  [LAUGH] Um, we're supposed to talk about whether we would lie to protect a family --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- member of a friend?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yes.
L:  Well, perjury is a lie of course, so ...
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I think that even if I -- I guess [MN] it's hard to know what you would do in that situation but even if I wanted to I think I would be terrible at it! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm not a very good liar, people can always tell 'cause I, you know, look uncomfortable and my face, you know, I give it away, so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I think I would readily caught if I tried to do it so [LAUGH] I probably would refrain.
L:  But do you think that you'd wanna do it, depending on what the circumstances are?
R:  Uh, I'm sure that part of me would want to do it but I think that I would have a guilty conscience about it and wouldn't be able to go through with it.
L:  Yeah, I'm probably the same.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I was trying to think if my friend did something horrible and I had to go to court to testify what would I do?  'Cause he's probably the only one I would even consider it.
R:  Right.
L:  But, I don't think so. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, I c- -- uh, I can imagine situations like maybe if you witnessed something and, um, like there would be recrimination against your family if you testified in court.  I can see that maybe I would just say I didn't see anythi- y- I -- I don't know, there's certainly situations where I think that the moral consequences of lying in court would be -- I could probably deal with it knowing that it would prevent something much worse from happening maybe.
L:  Yeah, that's [inaudible].
R:  I don't know, it's kinda hard to --
L:  It does depend on the, um, situation.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  But --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- I'm always surprised when I watch stuff on court -- at any court -- any court shows and things like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [COUGH] How often, um, people know that they're lying --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and allow it.
R:  Right.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I guess it's hard to prove or m- sometimes I guess just not worth it, but yeah, I think that a lot of it goes on that's not prosecuted.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  There's not too much to say on this subject.
R:  I know. [LAUGH]  Is it ten minutes, huh? [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Have you done many of these?
R:  This is my first one.
L:  Oh, is it?
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's only my third.
R:  I've -- I've missed, uh, several callers, like, I've gotten 'em on my answering machine but this is the first time I've been able to do it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I just recently signed up.  Have you done it frequently?
L:  Um, this is my third.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I haven't been home a lot so I know that I've missed a bunch.
R:  Yeah.  Hm.
L:  'Cause I signed up for during the week but evidently they -- I messed up or they messed up.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I get it on the weekends too.
R:  Yeah, I do s- -- I -- I -- I thought it was marking that I just wanted like, two, uh, it marked like, Tuesday and Sunday.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I think that that -- that meant Tuesday through Sunday 'cause I've been getting --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the messages --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on the machine several different nights though.
L:  [MN]
R:  I don't know.
L:  You could probably go onto the website again and check that.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hm.
L:  Lie in court.  You know, I just -- y- y- even when you go to traffic court you hear people say, "I wasn't speeding.  No matter what the police say, no matter what the radar gun says, I wasn't speeding".
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know, I think that I would just feel so intimidated by the surroundings that I would be scared into telling the truth even if I kinda wanted to lie! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, like --
L:  But what about the people, you know, who do?  And they -- and like you said before, it's so hard to prove sometimes.
R:  Yeah.  I guess that, um, if a- an oath doesn't mean much to you that you promise not to lie then there's not much you can do to prevent somebody from doing that.
L:  Exactly.
R:  So it's [LAUGH] -- I guess if the person is without, you know, their own moral compass then you can't really force that on somebody.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Hm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, have you ever been in court before, had to testify?
L:  Um, I haven't had to testify but I've been in traffic court a bunch of times and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- +watched what goes on and stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I used to volunteer for our local police department so -- and, um, hearing some of the stories that they tell and hearing other word of mouth things like everybody in prison says that they're not guilty and --
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Y- y- you wonder why the lawyers and the police have gotten the way that they have! [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I guess it's easy to get jaded when you see all that.
L:  That's right.
R:  I just got outta law school myself, I'm taking the bar -- the exam, this summer, so --
L:  Oh, good luck with that.
R:  -- I've -- I've been an observer before --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in court but I've never actually participated in anything, so --
L:  What kinda law do you wanna practice?
R:  I'm gonna be doing litigation.
L:  Ooh.
R:  Yeah. [LIPSMACK] 
L:  Good luck.
R:  A lot of products liability defense work I think --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- is what I'm gonna be doing.
L:  Well that'll be interesting.
R:  Yeah, I hope so. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Hope you pass the bar on your first try.
R:  I do too! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That'll be a very bad situation, like, you take it in July and I start working pretty soon after that but you don't find out --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- if you pass until October, so --
L:  Oh no.
R:  -- it would be terrible [LAUGH] to find out, after I'm --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- already in my office, you know, with cases, that I didn't actually pass, so --
L:  So you been hired somewhere?
R:  Yes.  Uh-huh.  I g- -- I worked for this firm during law school --
L:  Oh great.
R:  -- over several summers, so I got to know them and gonna go work for 'em the fall.
L:  Great.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.
L:  Yeah, yeah, that's nice.  I have a job interview tomorrow, I've been out of work for a long time. [COUGH]  I have to do a presentation for the interview.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh -- on what? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They let you know ahead of time?
L:  On anything I want. [MN]
R:  Oh, interesting.  It is a public speaking kind of job or something?
L:  No, uh-uh.
R:  Oh, that's strange.
L:  It's a quality assurance manager in an IT department.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Like a book review or something? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] No, I do a lot of non profit work and I'm Vice President of PR for a, um, a -- one medium sized non profit organization and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so I'm kinda used to doing these kinds of things, so it doesn't scare me, it just, I don't know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- what -- what they're gonna prove. [LAUGH]
R:  It is kind of strange though. [LAUGH]
L:  It is, yes. [LAUGH]
R:  My husband's looking for a job right now, so he's been going to a lot of interviews himself --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- trying to find something.
L:  It's pretty terrible here [several inaudible words].
R:  It has been, the economy is so bad.  He has an MBA but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I think he's over qualified for a lot of things that are available and so they don't wanna hire him for that and then he doesn't, you know, he's just out of school so he doesn't have a lot of experience --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so it's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- hard to get started.
L:  Right.  MBA doesn't mean anything right out of school anymore.
R:  I know.
L:  It's pretty bad.
R:  hm.
L:  Well, it's really been, uh, fun hearing your perception of perjury. [LAUGH]
R:  Perjury, yes. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I guess we're both opposed to it. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] But, I mean, uh --
R:  That's funny.
L:  -- the view of a lawyer. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Soon to be lawyer I guess. [LAUGH]
L:  Soon to be a lawyer.
R:  I may have a different perspective after a few years. [LAUGH]
L:  I'm sure, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, if you're doing the kind of litigation that you are, you probably won't have too much of a problem but --
R:  I don't know, the attorneys -- for instance, there's, um, I've been working some on some of the cases they have and, um, to get a -- to keep a case in state court and keep it out of federal court, which is what a lot of plaintiffs in Mississippi want to do --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you have to, um, limit -- well, if -- if you're claiming in damages more than seventy five thousand dollars then -- then --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the defendant can remove it to federal court.
L:  Oh.
R:  So the plaintiffs in the complaint will just put the day you're claiming seventy four thousand nine hundred and ninety nine dollars --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- to try to keep it out.  In some of these depositions they've been asking on me, "Oh, where did you come up with that number?"
L:  Mhm.
R:  And some of the things they say are hilarious like, "Oh, I've just always liked nines" or, you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "It just came to me" [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "Really, really?  Is that what you came up with it?" [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So --
L:  Yeah, that's cool. [LAUGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK] I, uh, I don't know.  [LIPSMACK] So I bet I will see some of that. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I'm sure. [LAUGH]
R:  Hm.
L:  [inaudible] be a whole lot --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well --
L:  -- of stuff you didn't think about. [LAUGH]
R:  I know! [LAUGH]  Oh, well, um, I haven't been keeping up with the time, do they tell you when it's been long enough?
L:  They do, they break in.
R:  They break in?  Okay.
L:  Yeah, it should be almost -- almost done.
R:  Okay.
L:  The last person that I talked to, um, was a very religious person and we were suppo- -- I don't even remember what the subject was but it was -- we -- she just talked about religion all the [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's not my forte but [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I remember, uh, one of the, uh, actually I tried to get connected one time and it didn't go through on the other end, I could never hear the other person, but my question was something like, um, what countries do we need to be afraid of in the world?  I was like, gosh, what are they trying to [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] Oh.
R:  I just thought that was a very bizarre topic, that they were --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- you know, kind of --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [LAUGH] alarmist! [LAUGH]
L:  Well it is, and it's, uh, kind of, um, scary that they would ask people when most people's views come from the media.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Like, I don't know what's going on, I only know what I've been told, yeah.
R:  Whatever was on the news tonight is what I'm scared of! [LAUGH]
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  Huh.
L:  And you wonder how much of that is a lie. [LAUGH]
R:  I know, I know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's got [LAUGH] -- the news is just so over produced these days it's kinda hard to trust it.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  They have s- -- it's so dramatized.  Like, in the s- -- this is -- the, um, radio stations here make fun of this but in the south, you know, when we get snow the whole, you know, everything shuts down.
L:  Right.
R:  So [LAUGH] --
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  We just don't know how to handle it, you know!
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so this past summer we had, um, a pretty heavy
