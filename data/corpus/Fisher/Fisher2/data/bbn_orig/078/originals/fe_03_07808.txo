R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, my name is --
R:  Hi.
L:  -- Brooke.
R:  Hi, I'm Christy, how are you doing?
L:  I'm doing well.
R:  Good.
L:  Uh, have you done this before?
R:  Yes, once before, have you?
L:  No, this is my first time.
R:  Oh okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, we talk, uh, we gotta have a conversation about the topic and, uh, they're recording, you know, as -- as we're talking. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  Where -- where are you?
R:  Texas.
L:  Where do you live?
R:  Um, I'm from Texas.  Where are you from?
L:  Okay, I'm from Alabama and I just, uh, moved here to Los Angeles.
R:  Oh okay, wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well that sounds neat.
L:  It is, it's, uh, it's really wild, going from a very small town to a real big city.
R: Yeah, I bet.  Is it for a job?
L:  Um, I -- actually it's kind of sort of [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've been going back and forth for about a yeah and, uh, I have good friends and I finally decided that it would be best if, um, I came out here and would probably get better work opportunities and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I like to do art work and it's hard to get ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know, a smaller town --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- it's real hard to get no- no- noticed.
R:  Right, yeah, I know.  I can -- I can see the -- the contrast between Alabama and Los Angeles. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Well, uh, [NOISE] perjury, w- would we commit perjury for a close relative or friend? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well --
L:  How do you feel?
R:  Well I don't feel good about lying, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- under oath, you know, but it depends on -- I guess it'd depend on ... w- on what -- what it was.  I mean, if -- if the friend or relative was guilty or not.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Um, and that -- it'd depend on the e- extreme of what it was or ...
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  But if it was something -- someone in my family had once done something terribly wrong that hurt others I think that, um, yeah, I wouldn't be able to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- keep it from someone.
R:  Right.
L:  Just as anybody else.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, perhaps if ... I don't -- oh, no --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'm a very [inaudible] person, it would be hard to ... l- lie about anything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Even if, uh, it was something small.
R:  Right.  Yeah, that's the same here.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah, I'd have a hard time dealing with it on my conscience, yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So --
L:  Are you real close to your family?
R:  Uh, yeah, some -- well, somewhat.  I mean, not -- not real close but talk to 'em probably once every week or two weeks.
L:  Mhm.
R:  How about you?
L:  Yeah.  My, uh, I'm close to my mother, my father I'm not.  Uh, I'd like to be closer to him and, um, he's -- actually there's been a couple of situations where [LIPSMACK] I -- I just started to get to know him a few years ago and he's the type of person who would ask me to do something, uh, possibly lie for him, uh ... I don't know.
R:  Do something, what, I'm sorry?
L:  I'm sorry, my phone is really not t- on a very good connection.
R:  Oh okay.
L:  Um, I just said my father, he, um, [LIPSMACK] he's actually asked me, he's in a wheelchair, he's paralyzed.
R:  Oh, goodness.
L:  And, uh, he's asked me to u- uh, give doctors false information so he could get medication.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, that was real tough.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and I did do that once, so I guess, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I have.
R:  Yeah --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- but it's kind of uh --
L:  My [inaudible] family.
R:  It sounds kinda like this, the topic we're talking about, I mean --
L:  E- exactly.
R:  -- it- itself, you know, when there's a close -- it's a close person to you.  So --
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, especially when it's someone -- like, he just hasn't always been in my life and I want dear -- you know, I really, really want him to be part of my life and it's just getting to know him.  It's hard not to do something that he --
R:  Right.
L:  -- wants me to do then, if it's not right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm.
R:  Well have you ever -- have you ever testi- testified in court, I guess?
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] no I haven't.
R:  Okay.  I haven't either.
L:  Mm mm.  Uh, and ever- -- and -- and there's never nothing -- noth- uh, nothing's ever happened in my family, we're -- we're pretty mellow, there's no drama.
R:  Right, right.
L:  There's never been any reason for us to have a court case of -- of any sort.
R:  Right.
L:  Um ... but, um, no! [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, same here.
L:  Um --
R:  Yeah, as a matter of fact I've never even been, uh, selected as part of a jury.
L:  N- n- n- --
R:  I've been a --
L:  Neither have I.
R:  H- huh?
L:  I -- I haven't either.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um --
R:  I've been, uh, college student and from college student to, um, uh, housewife, tak- taking care of children, so ...
L:  How many children --
R:  -- our kids.
L:  -- do you have?
R:  Two.  Uh, one of 'em --
L:  Oh.
R:  One of 'em is almost two and the other one is three and a half, so [LAUGH] --
L:  Wow.  Yeah, I have a six year old brother.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  Um, I'm twenty four.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um --
R:  Okay, and I'm --
L:  I grew up the only child.  Like I said, my family and I are super, super close, we've never had -- there's never been any type of ... miscommunica- -- yeah, I don't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Disfunction, it's just pretty good.  Um, anyhow, so my mother waited eighteen years to have ... me -- uh, to have my little brother.
R:  Wow.
L:  I -- so it's pretty wild.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um ... so --
R:  Huh.
L:  I don't know [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's really strange, uh, I feel very on the spot, I'm sorry if I'm not communicating very well.
R:  No, no, that's okay. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  It -- yeah, and if you don't wanna say something, don't say it. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]  I -- I just, um, I didn't -- I've -- I've been, uh -- I signed up to do this last week and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I'm -- I never received a call, I haven't received a call the past few days and I thought perhaps that, uh, they di- -- I -- I kinda thought that they weren't doing the study with women.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Because it seemed more male oriented.
R:  Right.
L:  My friend, um, who, um, told me about this, he -- he's done it a few times and each person that he's -- has spoken with has been a -- a male.
R:  Okay.
L:  And, uh --
R:  Has he gotten paid for doing this?
L:  Um, no, not yet.
R:  Okay.  Okay, I've been wondering.  I did it -- as I say, I did this probably a little less than a week ago and I was wondering, well, as I say, I wonder how long it takes, you know, for them to pay you for each time?  And you do it like, three times --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, so --
L:  What was the to- -- what was your topic, um, last time you -- you spoke?
R:  Last time was, uh, animals, you know, pets.
L:  Oh.  Oh, that's --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- that's cool. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I could've talked about that.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, the only thing is, I don't have any pets! [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, so, yeah, it's kinda difficult.
R:  So the other person was telling me about her pets and stuff. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  But, um --
L:  Was -- and was -- she was a female?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Okay, so they must do [MN] female, female, male, male.
R:  Yeah, pair you up with the same sex.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess.
L:  Well, I -- you know, I think that as far as [inaudible] going in front of a jury --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- for a family member, uh ... if -- if I knew that the per -- if I knew that the- they were not guilty --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but in some way I -- I -- I would, uh ... maybe change the story just a bit sort of thing.
R:  Right.
L:  To help them.
R:  Right.
L:  I may.  I p- --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I probably would if it was, uh, serious, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Just --
R:  I kinda feel the same way. [NOISE]
L:  I hear your children.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]  They have to be where mom is. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I miss -- I miss being around children terribly.  I'm hoping that I can get a nanny job here.
R:  Oh okay.
L:  I'm, uh -- I just -- it's hard [MN] -- I was around kids a lot, I did home school, I home schooled two little girls back in Alabama --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- three days a week.  And did art classes.  And geography.
R:  Huh.
L:  [inaudible] so, um, it's ... um, yeah, it's hard --
R:  That's neat.
L:  -- n- not being around that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that innocence.  They -- they keep you in check.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Uh, how simple things really are and the tiniest things make -- make you happy.
R:  Right.  Yeah, it's --
L:  I don't know.
R:  -- [NOISE] it's definitely interesting every day, the --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- things that they learn and ...
L:  Yeah, they're just open books.
R:  -- how -- how innocent they are.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Like little sponges, they used to absorb --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- every -- everything.
R:  Yes.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  And you --
R:  Very --
L:  -- y- you learn too, constantly.
R:  Right, right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You learn things about yourself.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  Um ... wow.
R:  Well ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Let's see --
L:  So we -- we just -- can -- do they, um -- when the ten minutes it comes to an end, how do you know that, uh
