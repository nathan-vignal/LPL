L:  Hi --
R:  Hi.
L:  -- this is Brandon Mercer.
R:  Hi.  My name is Nancy.  I'm in California.
L:  Hi, Nancy.  I'm in California as well.  In, uh, El Toredo[?], Northern California.
R:  Oh, Northridge. 
L:  Oh, very good.  I have some friends who live there.  
R:  [LAUGH]  Okay.
L:  So this is -- interesting topic, huh?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I -- I think pretty flat out I would say, no, I don't think I would.  But I guess, uh, you know, it's a hypothetical situation.  That's what we're supposed to talk about so hypothetically maybe there -- +there always is a situation where someone would do that.
R:  Well.  Hm.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't know.  Um, I guess [MN] -- I don't think that I could flatly say that I never would.  Um, wh- what if it was, say, my child?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I felt that that kid was being falsely accused of something --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- would I be willing to lie to get him --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- off the hook because I thought he was innocent?  That, you know -- I don't know.
L:  Good point.  Yeah, I think, I --
R:  I'd hate to be -- I'd hate to be faced with that type of a situation.
L:  Right.
R:  I think I -- I want to say, flatly, that I wouldn't.  But you're -- you're absolutely right.  I -- I don't think I -- I think you're right.  I -- I think I shouldn't and I don't think I could say that I absolutely wouldn't.  And I guess the -- the bigger question, I guess, is what -- uh, whether the end justifies the means or the means justifies the end?
L:  And, [MN].  In my opinion, I guess, I always held that the means justifies the end.  You do the right thing and whatever outcome comes that's what's meant to be.  
R:  Yeah.  Except that if you look at the justice system --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in this country, um, it's corrupt.  Th- there are parts of it that are corrupt.  
L:  This is absolutely true.  
R:  If you can afford a -- a high pressure attorney you can usually --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- g- get more justice than if you have a public defender.  Let's put --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it that way.
L:  Yeah, well [LAUGH] I lived in L.A. [LAUGH] during the O.J. trial and I'm sure you did too so ...  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, okay, then you --
L:  But --
R:  -- know what I'm talking about.
L:  Yeah, that's a good example that.  Although in -- in OJ's case my -- my personal opinion is they framed a [MN] a guilty man.  [LAUGH]  That's my [LAUGH] personal opinion.
R:  That they -- 
L:  Hm.,
R:  Say that again.  I --I didn't follow you.
L:  Oh.  My -- my personal opinion in the O.J. case is that -- that he was framed but the police framed a guilty man.  
R:  Oh, I see what --
L:  That -- that --
R:  -- you're saying.
L:  The police did make some errors and -- and, you know, made sure that they could convict him but he was already guilty anyway.  
R:  Uh.  Uh.
L:  That -- that was my opinion of that case.
R:  Interesting.  Interesting.
L:  Yeah, a friend -- a friend of mine [LAUGH] gave me that side of it.  You know, that's a good [LAUGH] point.  That's -- that would make the most sense in this situation.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I guess what -- what situation could you think of where -- where you would lie under oath to protect someone?
R:  Well, I think --
L:  It's just if -- if you knew that they were, uh, the justice system wasn't gonna do justice anyway.  It wasn't gonna -- you -- you would do it to preserve justice?
R:  Well, [MN] the -- the example that I gave you.  If it was my child --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, and my child was on trial for a crime that I absolutely w- without a doubt knew he was innocent of.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I -- but then aga- -- [MN] I'm saying I'd hate to be faced with that.
L:  Right.  Right.  
R:  Because in a way I would be sacrificing my integrity and my --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- freedom --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because I felt that the justice system was not just.
L:  Exactly.  But you know, as a -- well, it sounds like you're a parent [MN] so obviously -- so, uh, I guess parents make those decisions then parents usually would sacrifice their, uh, yeah, their freedom or whatever it is for their child, if that was the right thing to do in that situation.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I -- I think -- I think you're -- you're right about that.  I think I would have to consider the -- the same things.  I -- I'm trying to come up with an example where -- where maybe I would do that and you know if -- I -- I'm guessing if -- if something were done.  I -- since this is supposed to be for hypotheticals.  If it worked out hypothetically that there was a -- a crime that, uh, that someone I cared about was charged with and my testimony -- if I told the truth in my testimony it would somehow convict that person, even though that person didn't deserve to be convicted, I -- I think I would think long and hard about lying under oath.  But then again if -- if the person who I cared deeply about was guilty and had done the crime, um, and I just didn't want them to be convicted of it, uh, I think -- I don't -- I [MN] under that kind of situation I don't think that I -- I would be able to lie under oath.  I think I would, pretty much assume that that was the decision the person made and, like it or not, that person made it and that they have to live with that.  I think it would only be if -- if -- if me perjuring myself would -- would create a better justice overall.  Does that make sense?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And -- and I would agree with that.  I -- I don't think that I could swear to tell the truth and lie if I knew that I was aiding and abetting someone --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- who had broken the law.  I don't think --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- I could do that.  
L:  Yeah.  And I guess the other question is -- is in perjury you're -- you're sworn to tell the truth and the whole truth so, yeah, maybe there's a question of what does the whole truth mean and how much do you -- how much do you give in and would -- would there be another, uh, another hypothetical situation where you -- there might be, uh, some grey area, you know?  But the whole truth question has always -- always struck me as there's -- there's a lot of wiggle room in that.
R:  Well, yeah, and -- and that's interesting because, um, an attorney isn't going to allow you to speak freely.  He's --
L:  Exactly.
R:  He or she is going to limit you.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Probably to a yes or no.  
L:  E- exactly.
R:  So if you're trying to get the whole truth out --
L:  [LAUGH]  Uh-huh, that's what I was thinking.
R:  -- um, it's gonna be difficult.  
L:  Precisely, yeah.
R:  If not impossible.
L:  And -- and your -- your own attorney could [LAUGH] could allow you to not tell the whole truth and therefore the cross examination has to, you know, work to get the whole truth out of there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But -- but there's a situation where you, uh, you're leaving out certain details or you're answering as -- as narrowly [MN] -- narrowly answer the question as possible.  You don't get the whole truth out there and -- and I guess it's, uh, I guess it's a question of whether that would be considered perjury or whether +anybody -- anybody could realise that was perjury in the first place.  
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
L:  But I think we're definitely in agreement on the, uh, situations under which we would commit perjury.  
R:  Yeah, and -- and I certainly wish that I didn't feel that way about the justice system.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But I've had --
L:  No.
R:  -- too much, um, dealings with it in my line of work --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that I can see that people buy justice --
L:  Mhm.
R:   --if you want to call it that, all the time.
L:  Mhm.  May -- may I ask what you do for a living?
R:  Um, a social worker.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I investigate child abuse cases.
L:  Oh, wow.  You've [LAUGH] -- then you [LAUGH] absolutely deal with that first hand.  
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
L:  Is it, uh, do you think the problem for the justice system are based on, uh, economic differences?  Or is it racial or gender or, you know, the status in life?
R:  Well, it's how -- how much can you afford for an attorney?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean, really.  That's what --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it boils down to.  
L:  A really, um -- a really, really good, uh, legal n- non fiction book [MN] called Gideon's Trumpet about the right to counsel and the, uh, the right of the indigent to have a -- an attorney.  And it's interesting --
R:  It's that fict- --
L:  -- [MN] -- What's that?
R:  Is that fiction?
L:  No, it's non fiction.  It's -- it's about an actual case that, uh, that created the -- the national, um, uh, legal precedent to have, uh, the poor represented by an attorney in all cases.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  In all serious crimes, I guess it was.  It was really interesting watching this happen because you -- you saw this person, Gideon, who was -- he was convicted at first without a -- without any good legal representation and then you saw throughout the whole system how he, you know, fought the Supreme Court and it was a real +interesting to the case because he, um, he wrote a handwritten, uh, plea to the Supreme Court and one of the clerks picked it up and -- and said, well, you know, th- this is totally not the format that things are supposed to be given in and it's completely [LAUGH] inappropriate but yet this guy's got a -- a good legal point, even though he has the education of a fifth grader.  And they took up the case and finally through that they -- they gave the -- the poor the right to an attorney.  But, yet, when you think about the situation, [LAUGH] it's not necessarily that much different because the attorneys they get are, you know, not the best out there.  They're paid for by the public and the public doesn't pay well.  And they will never have the kind of representation, uh, that -- that someone who's more well off could afford.
R:  Yeah.  True.  True.
L:  So ...
R:  When -- when was that made into a law?
L:  I -- I don't recollect.  I think it was in the seventies.  Um, I -- and the -- the name is Gideo- -- look up Gideon's Trumpet.  It's a really, really, well written book.
R:  Gideon- --
L:  I read it in one of my constitutional law classes.
R:  Gideon's +Counsel?
L:  Gideon's Trumpet.  
R:  Trumpet?
L:  Gideon's Trumpet.  Trumpet, yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  I'm trying to remember the -- the name of the actual case and I can't remember the name of the case.  Yeah, it's a -- it -- it -- it's still in -- in print and it's, uh, it's -- it's a great legal novel that explains this problem.  It was a really interesting case of how this happened.
R:  That -- that -- that --
L:  Uh, there was some kind of -- [MN] what's that?
R:  That does sound interesting.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's, uh, oh, yeah.  It was -- you'd think like non fiction about the law might not [LAUGH] be very interesting but this one was pretty well written and it was easy to, uh, to get into it.  
R:  Huh.  I'll look that up and -- and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- take a look at it.  
L:  Yeah, it's really a -- a good look at the legal system and the problems with it.
R:  Are you in the legal system?
L:  No, I'm a news producer.  Television news producer.
R:  Oh.  Okay. 
L:  So I, uh, yeah, I studied law in college.  I really enjoyed [inaudible].  I keep thinking about going to law school or continuing the education but I -- I work in news and it kind of tells you what's happening with the law, at least.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So I get -- get to do a little bit of that, at least.  Do my best to, uh, to teach people about what's happening.
R:  Unbiased reporting.
L:  [LAUGH]  Of course.
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  All right.
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's -- the funny thing is unbiased, there's
