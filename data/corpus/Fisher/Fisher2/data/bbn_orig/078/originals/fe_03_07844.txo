L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.  I'm Peggy.
R:  Hi.  I'm Mallory.
L:  Hi, Mallory.
R:  Nice to meet you over --
L:  [MN] Nice to [NOISE] meet you.
R:  -- the phone. [MN]
L:  [MN] You wanna go first? [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  Uh, oh, yeah, it doesn't matter. [MN]
L:  [MN]
R:  Um, if they gave me a million I would leave the United States.  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but the thing is, I do not know if I would never come back.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  That's the thing, so I don't know.  Do I still continue to talk or [MN] what happens?  'Cause --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it said that if you --
L:  Well, we've got ten minutes together.
R:  Okay, we have ten minutes together --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- okay, so as long as we both talk, I guess that would be [MN] --
L:  I guess so.  Yeah.  And -- and kinda --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- stick to k- -- topic.
R:  Okay.
L:  [MN]
R:  So, I'll just say that I would take a million dollars and I would leave the United States but I don't think forever because I -- I was born in this country and I like being an American and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm proud to be an American and, um, I have a lot of different interests.  I love antiquing and jewelry buying so [MN] no, I would --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- go probably to some country in Europe, um, where I've never been.  Um, I would say probably France and Italy --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I know I probably would find a lot of flea markets and different places that I could buy, you know, jewelry and antiques and probably resell them or keep what I want.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, probably would enjoying being in either of those country [MN] -- countries and I happen to speak some French.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I did take French in school --
L:  Did you?
R:  -- and I did take Italian in school --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so I'm somewhat familiar with both languages and [MN] have a lot of friends that are of Italian descent and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- do know some people, although I have no friends that are of French descent so I probably would enjoy being in either of those countries.  And I know there are a lot of things to see. [MN] Just, you know, going to school and being a college graduate.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [MN] Uh, you know, just reading up and knowing some of the history, you know, so I know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I would probably find different things to do and I know [MN] being into antiques -- uh, I hope I'm not boring you --
L:  Oh, you're not.  I -- I -- I love antiques.
R:  Oh, you do also?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's funny. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I do.
R:  I met someone --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- else on the phone --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- that enjoys, [MN] uh --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- antiques.  May I ask, even though I know I have to speak --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [MN] do you buy antiques and resell them or do you look for antiques and, you know, just --
L:  Well, I try --
R:  -- admire them?
L:  -- I u- -- well, I haven't, uh, bought them to resell.
R:  Okay.
L:  [MN] I -- I've got a few antiques in the house here that's [NOISE] of, uh, great value.
R:  Oh, good for you.
L:  [MN]
R:  Good for you.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yes.
L:  And got them purely by accident.  I -- I -- I'm out of New York.
R:  Oh -- oh, you're out of --
L:  And --
R:  -- New York.
L:  -- I've --
R:  'Cause see, I live in New York and --
L:  You do?  Where?
R:  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- actually, it's Queens.  It's one of the Burroughs --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- um, in New York.  It's not where I usually find [MN] different things and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there aren't really flea markets where I live, where I can go to buy them.  They're usually in Manhattan, I'm sure --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you've heard of Manhattan.  You might have --
L:  I lived in Manhattan.
R:  Oh, you lived in Manhattan.
L:  [MN] On --
R:  So, you know --
L:  -- Central Park West.
R:  Oh, [MN] okay, you lived far west.  Okay, [MN] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like, [LIPSMACK] well, in Manhattan, [MN] it's usually it's on -- on the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- west side but not far up.  Although there are some flea markets that do go to, so it is easier --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to find things in Manhattan.  That's where a lot of the dealers have --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- their stores --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, you know, seeing that's where --
L:  I know. [NOISE]
R:  -- a lot of the flea markets are.  But --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's funny that you'd +have an interest in antiques, also.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, [LIPSMACK] I know being an antique collector and even --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- though I do resell some of the things I have bought, I know probably any country in Europe, [MN] I probably would find flea markets and, uh, you know, places to go just --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- to look at things --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- even though I couldn't buy, you know, anything.  And I know, because I've always had in, [MN] um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, antiques --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and did take --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- French school and did take Italian in school and do know people [MN], uh, who [MN] Italian and French descent.  I know I probably would enjoy --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- going to those countries and meeting people and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you just --
L:  And getting the --
R:  walking a- --
L:  -- great deals and stuff, huh?
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  Do you buy them and sell them, resell them?
R:  Yes.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Well, I can't say that all the time.  Usually what I resell are things that I don't really like that much --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but I was a- -- I'm able to pick up cheaply or I get at a good price, you know?  If someone offers --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- me something and I know it has value, [MN] you know, I might buy it.  But --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  -- [MN] things that I really don't like or I do resell, if I can, I should --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- tell you. [MN] And --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, if I make money --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- usually I'll just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- try to find something else to buy --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with that money.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  So, that's what I do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, I am a social worker and, um --
L:  Oh, are you?
R:  Yes.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Although I'm not currently working now but I did work for the Salvation Army, I'm sure you're aware of them.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  [MN] And I know it's the Pope's favorite organization.
L:  Mhm.
R:  People that work [MN] for the Salvation Army have told me [MN] so, [LIPSMACK] it has given me the time, you know, to go on the weekends.  'Cause I work Mon- -- when I did work --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I was working Monday through Fridays so I did have Saturdays [NOISE] and Sundays off.  And you probably are aware that that's when you usually can go and -- to flea markets and that's --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- when they're usually open. [MN] And that's when you usually can find different things at the flea markets --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or even stores.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Although stores are usually open five days a week, sometimes six days a week but the flea markets are generally opened on, you know, the weekends only.
L:  Mm, mhm.
R:  [MN] So, that's when most of the dealers or people that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- collect and look for things go to these flea markets.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And there are a lot of them here in Manhattan --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which I'm sure you're aware of.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  So, [MN] that makes it interesting.  And I know in France [MN] there are quite a few flea markets that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- dealers that I know of talked about or have been to.  And I know even in Italy --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- although I'm not sure, 'cause there I don't know anyone that's been to any flea --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- markets but I'm sure there are flea markets there where you could --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- find things or --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- antique stores.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Maybe you could find things that are not expensive and maybe --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- someone doesn't know actually what they have.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- I've always had an interest in going to Europe [MN] and, um, always because I speak a little French and I speak a little, [MN] um, Italian [MN] those are two countries that I've always want to go to.  Also --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- specially to see [MN] the architecture and just, you know, look around the different fashion and [MN] the fashions that, you know, there're people wearing and the different stores are showing --
L:  Mm.  Mm.
R:  -- so those two countries have always be, uh, mm, very, uh, interesting to me.
L:  So, you would do that if you -- if someone --
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  -- gave you a million dollars.
R:  If I had the million dollars.
L:  [MN] But you would come back to the United States, is that right?
R:  Right, right. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  The only thing is, the reason why I say that, I probably wouldn't stay there forever is because I love being an American.  Not only because of what happened in two thousand and one, September eleventh, but all my life I've always loved [NOISE] America and because I haven't travelled any place else outside of the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- United States --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I've always considered myself, uh, you know, a complete American. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I don't think I would definitely not return but [MN] there's always that possibility 'cause you can't say never you know what I'm saying?
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, uh, I do think --
L:  I guess [MN] I'm not sure if they mean -- they say that in -- [MN] if -- if you wouldn't return and you would [MN] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [MN] and that, yeah.
R:  So, if you would return.  So, like I said, I couldn't say definitely not --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I don't know whether they wanted people to talk about if they would never return or if they possibly could return.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, that's why -- [MN] I don't really think I listened carefully or I didn't hear --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- exactly what they said and then th- th- they connected me to you. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then I just started talking 'cause --
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  -- I went first, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what I'm saying?
L:  Yeah. [MN]
R:  But, [NOISE] you know, it's just generally that I would love to travel to Europe and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I know those are two countries that I've always wanted to visit, France and Italy.  Those --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- have always intrigued a lot and that's why --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I guess, I took [MN] both languages in school because I always liked those two countries.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I love Italian food.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know if you share [LAUGH] --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that same --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- taste.
L:  I do like Italian food.
R:  Oh, you do? 
L:  Haven't been --
R:  [LAUGH] [inaudible] --
L:  -- [MN] haven't been able to find that great [MN], uh, Italian food here in Georgia.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.  You're from Georgia.  That's funny [MN] --
L:  Well, actually, I'm -- I'm -- I'm out in North Carolina.
R:  Oh, you're in North Carolina. [NOISE] 
L:  Moved to New Y- -- New York when I was sixteen and came back down here about twenty years ago.
R:  Okay.  And do you [MN] -- can I ask you this now?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, do you like it down there?
L:  [LIPSMACK] I do like Georgia.
R:  Oh, good for you.  And do y- -- you probably have warm weather down there, if I'm not mistaken.
L:  Have warm weather.
R:  Right, so you have warm weather and you probably don't have much snow there anymore, right?
L:  Nope.
R:  [LAUGH] Right?
L:  We don't.  No, we --
R:  Do you miss the snow?
L:  [MN] Yes.
R:  Okay, as they say at Christmas time, 'cause I know--
L:  Yes.
R:  -- here in Manhattan [MN] that's such a great time --
L:  [MN] I know.
R:  -- of year.  You know, even though --
L:  I know.
R:  -- people don't like --
L:  I know --
R:  -- the snow.  But --
L:  I --
R:  -- you know that, right.  Everyone loves --
L:  I know.
R:  -- to be in New --
L:  The Rockefeller Center --
R:  -- York City. [MN] R- --
L:  -- and the stores.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, yes.
R:  Walking down Fifth Avenue --
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  -- you know what I'm saying?
L:  Yeah, yeah. [MN]
R:  [MN] Just looking at the different deco- --
L:  The windows are done so nicely there.
R:  Right, right, right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I'm sure you're used to the warm weather now, so you probably --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- enjoy it, you know what I'm saying?
L:  [MN] I do, I do.
R:  [MN]
L:  Uh --
R:  And you don't have to wear [NOISE] heavy coats and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, worry [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- about the snow and driving or taking buses or trains, you know what I'm saying, in the weather.
L:  [MN] Well, let's see, what would I do?
R:  What would you do? [MN]
L:  [MN] If I -- they gave me a million dollars --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [MN] I probably would leave, uh --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- [NOISE] um, the United States.
R:  And where would you go?
L:  [MN]
R:  Okay.
L:  And I would love to -- I'm -- I'm kinda -- I'm kinda like you about not coming back --
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  -- but I would love to tour Africa.
R:  Oh, you'd like to tour Africa?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, that's interesting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  I would.
R:  Good.
L:  [MN]
R:  Okay, may I ask what countries?
L:  And, um, I would just -- [MN] I -- I -- I -- I would love to go over in the area where it's a lot of poverty and stuff --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [MN] and maybe try to put in some input and help in that area.
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  [MN]
R:  Okay.
L:  That's what I would like to do.
R:  Okay, good.
L:  Uh, [MN] [NOISE] I, uh, if -- a million dollar- [MN] -- I would have to come back to the United States at some point 'cause my family is here.  My daughters are grown and [MN] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I've got three grandchildren.
R:  Oh, good for you.
L:  [MN] And I could not --
R:  So, you see --
L:  -- imagine --
R:  Right.
L:  Not --
R:  Not coming back.
L:  -- coming back to see them --
R:  Exactly right.
L:  -- at some point.
R:  Right.
L:  [MN] Of course, you know, on the way back, if they wanted to take what I didn't spend, that would be fine --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- which would be nothing. [LAUGH]
R:  That's very fair of you.  That's very fair.  But at least you're honest enough like me [MN] to say that, you know, because you have family [MN] which --
L:  Yeah, I do.
R:  -- is different, I'm single --
L:  I do, I do.
R:  -- [MN] that would definitely make you want to come back.  You know, I'm saying I'm --
L:  Mm, that was one of the reasons I moved to Georgia.  'Cause we lived in Durham for so many years --
R:  Okay [MN] --
L:  -- after we moved.  Uh, and I moved to Georgia because my two daughters are here and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- uh, [MN] my --
R:  [MN] So, I completely understand.
L:  -- youngest daughter who's thirty two --
R:  Oh, good for you.
L:  -- uh, had a baby two years ago and I came down here --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I haven't gone home.  We put our house on the market, uh, to be rented --
R:  Right.
L:  [MN] and I haven't gone back home.
R:  Oh, you haven't?  Okay --
L:  Mm mm.
R:  -- w- [MN] wait, may I ask you this?  Have your daughters --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- visited New York at all?
L:  Well, she was born there.
R:  Oh, she was born there?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Okay, so she was born there, s- -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- okay, right. [LAUGH] Right.  And do they ever want to come back or --
L:  Well [MN] --
R:  -- ever come back to visit?
L:  -- Shannon came -- came back up there for a workshop, uh --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- [MN] they had a great time.
R:  Right.
L:  But she said that, you know, she [MN] doesn't think she -- she went to the Le- -- I don't know if you know anything about the Lennox School in, uh, down on Seventy Eighth Street?
R:  Mm, not quite.
L:  [MN] And, uh --
R:  No.
L:  -- uh, well, she went to that school and she --
R:  Right.
L:  -- went to the Park Avenue school when we was in New York.
R:  Right.
L:  [MN] But I d- -- I don't think I could not come back.
R:  Oh, okay.  Right.
L:  I could probably stay away a year.
R:  Right.  Okay, right.
L:  And, uh, in order, you know, [MN] I -- I would -- and that was the only -- only way I could take it, if -- if I wanted to come back.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And if they said to me, "Well, you know, when you come back you have to give back the money that you [MN] --"
R:  Oh, forget it.
L:  "-- um, that you didn't spend" --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so I would be able 'em about fifty cents. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I love [inaudible] right.  Exactly.  Because you get a million --
