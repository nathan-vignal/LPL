R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  My name is Maxine, I'm thirty eight and I live in West Virginia. [NOISE]
L:  I'm Nick, I'm s- -- eighteen and I live in New Jersey.
R:  Okay.  Well, you don't have too much time to -- to want to go back to change, do you? [LAUGH]
L:  Not really.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, goodness.  You go first.
L:  Um, I think -- I think I would, uh -- I -- I just got on so I don't have much time to think about it so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't know, I think I would, um --
R:  Is this your first time?
L:  No, this is my third.
R:  Oh, okay, mine also.
L:  Uh.  Um, I think I would change -- I don't know, school records, I guess, I don't know.  Not much -- not much else I'm going to change.
R:  That's what I was going to say, you're all -- you're so young, you know, you're --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- well, I'd have to agree with you there, I would -- I'd definitely go back and change, uh, you know, a lot of things, especially school, I'd pay a lot more attention.  Um, I definitely wouldn't get married as young as I did.  I got married when I was sixteen --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and I definitely would change that.  I wouldn't want to change the fact I have two sons.  I have, uh, a sixteen year old and a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- twenty one year old, I wouldn't change the fact that I have them.  Uh, but, um, I would if I could, you know, put it off a few years and still have them I would, but, uh, I would definitely change that, I would, you know, live a little more, uh, you know, at least grow up because I was still a child, you know, myself when I got married, uh ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you have any little escapades or anything that you'd go back and change?  Did you ever, like, take your dad's car out when you wasn't supposed to or ...?
L:  Um, no, but I have -- I have gotten in trouble with the law quite a few times. [SIGH]
R:  Okay, would --
L:  'Cause it's just the area I live in.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] I -- I would -- I would change some of that, you know.  Um, like, I -- I was, um -- I was selling drugs [NOISE] for a while --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, uh, I'm not proud of it but, you know, I would change it if I had the opportunity.
R:  Well, there's nothing from being ashamed of it, I mean, you're being honest, I mean, you're not the only person, you know, that's ever done that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, I mean, at least you're  -- you know, you're talking about it and you see that, uh, you know, you shouldn't have --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and you've learned from that.
L:  I was only fourteen when I did that though.  I didn't really know what I was getting into.
R:  Mhm.  Was you, uh, provoked or was it a friend or just someone did ask you or ...?
L:  I -- I saw people making a lot of money with it so it was, like, I said, "I need some money", so I just went into it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I-- I'd just started doing what I could.
R:  How long did you actually do it?
L:  Uh, about two or three years and then I got caught 'cause my friend snitched.
R:  Mm.  How did your parents feel about that, did they know or ...?
L:  Uh, they -- they -- they didn't take it as hard as I thought they would. [NOISE] I thought they'd get really pissed off and kick me out of the house or something, but they didn't. [NOISE]
R:  Were they understanding?
L:  Actually, they didn't really say anything about it.
R:  Do you feel that it was -- they're -- they were to blame for part of it?
L:  No.  It wa- -- it was just my need for money -- my want for money.
R:  Okay.  So, they were the type of parents --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- then that they -- they should have been?  Were they +supportive -- supportive of you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- +attentive to you?
L:  Yeah.  They -- there was nothing wrong with them it was just, you know, I saw that there was more money than just getting an allowance and there was a lot more money to it, so I went and I went for it. [NOISE]
R:  That's understandable, I mean, it happens every day, I mean, you know, like I said, you're not the only person that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it ever happened to and you'll not be the only one that it ever does happen to, you know.  I guess, you know, you take kids and they see the dollar signs and they think, "Well, you know --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- this is easy money here, you know.  I could do this and have money and --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- get pretty much what I want".  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, I, uh -- besides of, uh, going back and changing being married so young, I'd -- I was married for, uh, twe- -- uh, twelve years --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then I got divorced, uh, I don't regret that.  Um, I've been divorced for ten years but I got in a relationship just right after I got divorced that I -- if I could go back and change that I would.  Um, [MN] I was a person that, I guess, well for I was so young when I got married I wasn't very --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- experienced --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- uh, my husband had been the only man that I'd ever been with and I guess when we went our separate ways, uh, I was real vulnerable to, um, people out here, men, that, you know, knew the ropes of it and knew exactly what to say and what to do.  Um, so, I mean, you're not the only person that's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, ever done anything that you're not -- you know, that you're not proud of.  I mean, I got involved with this guy, um, he was like a con artist.  I mean, he knew exactly what to say and exactly what to do and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he just completely made a fool out of me and, uh, I'm not proud of that.  Um, I dated him two years and a half, I found him out for what he really was the first year, but it took me a year and a half to get rid of him.
L:  Uh.
R:  He was a complete nut case, I had to end up getting a restraining --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- order against him.  He kidnapped me --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- [LAUGH] so, I mean, I've done a few things.  Don't feel bad.  I have done a few things and I mean, I was a grown woman --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, when this happened, I was, like -- let's see -- sixteen -- I was, like, twenty eight or twenty nine years old.  But you -- you would, uh, think a normal woman would have known better --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, I didn't.  But, I mean, I know better now, I'm thirty eight now and I know better.
L:  Yeah, well you have a lot more experience than -- now than a lot of other women.  You know, you -- you -- you can pass it on -- if you have a daughter you could pass it on to them or her [MN] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or your kids or your sons -- you could pass it on to them. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  This way they won't make the same mistake you did.
R:  Well, they've lived it.  They've, uh -- they've seen the mistakes that I've made but which I've never let that interfere, you know, with my relationship with them.  I mean, I've worked, uh, ever since I've been fourteen years old.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, I come from a poor family, uh, we didn't starve or anything but, you know, we -- we didn't have everything we wanted and I've --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- always worked for what I've got, I've got a good job now, I work construction.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I make, like, twenty two or twenty three dollars an hour, it's a union job I have for the past ten years and I've raised my two sons alone with that --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- and so --
L:  -- I make -- I make--
R:  -- pardon?
L:  -- I make, um, eighteen bucks an hour working, that's at Pocono Country Club.
R:  Well, that's great.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That -- that is -- do you -- is that your interest, do you like doing that?
L:  No, actually computers is but I love to cook so much it's just -- and there's money in it so I just --
R:  Well, why don't you get into a school for it and become a chef?
L:  Because I already know how to do it.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, yeah.
R:  Okay.  But would it help you, like, to make more money if you had, like, the credentials behind it?
L:  Well, right now I'm going to school for, um -- for computers.
R:  Okay.
L:  That's what I want to do, you know.
R:  Well, if that's your true love, you know, I mean, you're -- you -- you need --
L:  'Cause it --
R:  -- to pursue that.
L:  -- it's -- it's that it's so easy and that there's such a high demand for it --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that, you know -- have a lot of money --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I'm good at it, so I just go for it.
R:  Well, it comes natural to you then, doesn't it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, that's great then, I mean, sure, go for it, the sky's the limit, I mean, just -- I'll tell you just like I have told both my sons, "It doesn't matter where you come from or who you are, if you've got the desire and the -- the persistence you can be or do anything that you -- you know, you desire to be".
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  And it doesn't matter whether you're rich or poor you've just got to have the ambition and you can -- you can do anything you set your mind to do and don't ever --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- let anybody tell you you can't because you're just as good --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- as the next person out here --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is not better than a whole lot more that I've ever run into --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and don't ever forget that.  Because you are somebody and don't ever feel bad about any past mistakes that you might have made.  I mean, I used to kick myself but I just -- I quit because, I mean, I'm not perfect but I'm human --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and there's always somebody out there that is in a worser boat than you that's done a whole lot worse --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- than you've ever done.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you just hold your head high.  I mean, you're young, you've got your whole future ahead of you and I -- I've got a feeling you -- you are -- you are somebody but you're going to achieve -- you're going to accomplish everything that you set out to do.
L:  I hope so.
R:  You will.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I feel that you will.  You seem like a really nice guy --
L:  Thank you.
R:  -- a nice young man [NOISE] and I can tell, you know, I asked you in the beginning if, you know -- if you blamed --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- your parents for anything, but you're real -- real courteous, you seem like a rea- -- you know, you talk like you're a real, nice gentleman so your parents have raised you right to respect people.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you talk like that, you talk like you know you've got the respect for other people, so that right there's a -- you know, one of the major things in this life.  I've always taught my boys to treat people as though you would, you know, want to be treated.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And just trust in the good Lord and you can't go wrong.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, uh, you go after what you [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if you've computers is what you want to do, you go into it and who knows you might end up --
