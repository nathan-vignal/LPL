L:  Hi, I'm Susan.
R:  Hello, I'm Monica.
L:  [SIGH] So, we just supposed to talk now?  'Cause, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- uh, it's my first time doing this.
R:  Yes, let's -- let's say if you get one million dollar to leave the US where would you go?
L:  Well, I would go to Israel.  [LIPSMACK] Um, I used to live there for [LIPSMACK] a couple of years and I wouldn't mind returning and a million dollars would sure help.
R:  Oh well --
L:  How about you?
R:  Me?  I would go back to my country, Jamaica, West Indies.  Yeah, because I was forced to come here unbeknownst to me.  I -- I'll end up liking it but I miss home a lot.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.  And I could make a nice living with that.  And they said, "What would you miss the most?"
L:  What would I miss the most about here?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Huh, family probably.
R:  No.  I don't have any family here.  I would miss the nightlife because sometime, you know, I can get up one, two o'clock in the morning, go for a subway ride, go into Manhattan, just eat and talk and then come back home.  I would miss that most.
L:  Mhm.  I have a lotta family here.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Um, most of my family's here.  I'd -- I have actually one sister now who lives in Israel so --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- I would have some family there also.
R:  Yeah, most of my family is there so I'm really lonely here now.  [LIPSMACK] And, uh, other topic is, uh, mm, mhm -- I don't know what else to do.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  A million dollars.  You would have to share the million with anybody or you would keep it all by yourself?
L:  Well, I have -- well, I -- I'm married and with kids so obviously I'd --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- share with my family.
R:  Oh.
L:  And I'd give -- I think I would give a, you know, percentage to charity.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And ... [LIPSMACK] what else would I do with it?  Well, I don't think I would have to work for a very long time or ever, because that's -- the million dollars is pretty good, and invest a lot of it.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Is the exchange rate just the same as here?  What's the exchange rate?
L:  Sorry?
R:  What's the exchange rate?  One to one?  How many US dollars for --
L:  Oh, the exchange rate.  [LIPSMACK] Um, it's, um, about four to one.
R:  [MN]
L:  Four to one US dollars.
R:  Oh.  But in my country it's fifty to one.  So with that million I would've had fifty million dollars and that'd be a lot to give away.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  Yes, I wouldn't keep so much.  I would just make sure I had a nice little house, nothing big, you know, nice little car, somebody to help me out, and that's about it.  So how long you in this program?
L:  This is my first time, I just signed up yesterday, so --
R:  I did too.  And they said they will give me a PIN in three days, so I figure -- I was just getting ready to go out, you know, I said, to call between two and three and they said they will give me a PIN and stuff like that.  So where did you see the -- where did you find the [LIPSMACK] -- the advertisement?
L:  Oh, on, um, [LIPSMACK] on a forum for -- it's called Big Big Savings dot com, it's a forum.
R:  Oh.  Yeah, I saw it in --
L:  Someone mentioned it.
R:  -- in one of the -- one of the newspaper, Village Voice or This Resident or something I was reading last week and I went back and I read it, so I say it's good to find somebody to talk to and somebody just wanna talk to but most of the time they give us the topic to talk about.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well, can talk about anything else.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Mhm.  I think we have to wait for ten minutes.
L:  Yeah, we have to -- they are supposed to tell us when ten minutes are up, it said.
R:  Oh yes, now ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So after you go --
L:  So what --
R:  -- and give away half the money, what you would with the rest?
L:  I wouldn't give away half, I'd probably give away twenty percent --
R:  Twenty percent.
L:  -- to charity.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I would -- I have already a -- I already have a house in Israel but I might sell it and buy something nicer.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And ... what else would I do?  I don't even know.
R:  Well I have so much family I would have to purposely set away some of the money so if they come I can say, "Oh, [LIPSMACK] if you look for it and find it, good luck" you know, because, oh, I have about eight brothers and sisters, about fifty nieces and nephews, and it's like, "Oh, Aunty Ava[?], Aunty Av-" [LIPSMACK], oh brother.  So --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Eventually -- and you can't come back if you get a million dollars.
L:  Yeah, can't come back.  Well, I can --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I could live with that I think.
R:  Yeah, I could live with that.
L:  People will have to come visit me.  My family will have to come with me.
R:  [LIPSMACK] It's close to retirement -- yes, "I'll just buy you a ticket".  I say, "Oh, I send you your ticket, you can come".
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's close to retirement for me anyway, so I could leave.  I --
L:  I could definitely leave.
R:  Yeah, I could leave.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Uh, that's been a long ten minutes, huh?  Two oh five [SIGH] -- it's more than ten minutes now. [LIPSMACK]
L:  I don't know -- I don't know how they measure --
R:  Anyway, what else do I have to talk about? [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So you have -- so you have kids?  How many kids?
L:  I have two kids.  I have two --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- girls.
R:  Yeah?
L:  A four year old and a six year old.
R:  Oh, they're little.  Mine is twenty nine.
L:  [inaudible].
R:  It's the only one I have.  Mm.  They're little kids.
L:  And he's -- he's here or he's ...?
R:  Yeah, she's here.  She's born here, she's married, she didn't have any children as yet.  [LIPSMACK] Says she's not ready to be anybody's mom yet.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Well, that's about it.  It's taking them a long time for this ten minutes.
L:  Yeah.  I don't know.  I wasn't [inaudible] --
R:  So you stay home a lot too?
L:  Um, usually, yeah.  I work a little bit, you know, here and there.
R:  Oh yeah.  I usually gotta work at nights but today's my day off.  And I'm gonna tell 'em, uh, in the day time, that's between two and three, and what sort of time at nights?  They should have called yesterday, yesterday I could have talked all day because --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it was Sunday --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know.  I'd rather talk in the nighttime during the week --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- 'cause sometime you need somebody to talk to.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And since this is speech therapy class ...
L:  [NOISE] Well this t- time for me is the quietest 'cause my kids aren't here and my husband's at work.
R:  Oh, okay --
L:  So --
R:  -- I see.
L:  So evening I'm not, you know, I'm with my family and I can't talk to anybody. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  Everybody's out working.  Well you stay home a lot?
L:  Well, [SIGH] I usually work --
R:  It's a nice day today, then go out and get some, uh, sun.
L:  I work usually Monday through Sunday, so I'm off --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- Monday and Tuesday.
R:  Yeah, I'm off Monday, Tuesday --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- too.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Okay, it's nice talking with you, we just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- gotta wait for the beep.  I guess they have to hear us talking.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's, uh, what did I say it was?  Ten [several inaudible words], some speech stuff. [MN]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So what part of the -- the United States do you live?
L:  In Baltimore, Maryland.
R:  Oh, I'm in Brooklyn, New York.
L:  [inaudible].
R:  Wow.  I guess they all gotta tie 'em up together.  You said you could talk this time?
L:  Huh huh.
R:  Oh yeah, I did that too.  I made too much mistakes filling out that form yesterday.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] In Maryland.  Oh, so how's the weather up there?
L:  It's nice. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah?
L:  It's sunny and bright, for -- for -- for a change, yesterday it was really raining, um --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- it was really bad yesterday and today it's beautiful.
R:  Yeah.  Went out for some sun today myself, it was nice.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, so ... [LIPSMACK]   So, would you live any other state?
L:  Well I used to live in California.
R:  Yeah?  And you come from one end to the ne- --
L:  And that's where my parents live.
R:  Wow.  You come all the way east, mm.
L:  Yep.
R:  Wow.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  No, I don't --
L:  So --
R:  -- have much -- most of my family is in Orlando, so just my daughter and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and myself here.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And I have a couple of cousins but they moving too.  So when they all move, we move.
L:  Mm.
R:  So I may go to Florida soon.
L:  [NOISE] Okay.
R:  I don't know what else to talk about.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Hm.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  So would you open a business with the million dollars?
L:  Um, well that's a good idea maybe.  I might like to do that.  I was thinking about opening up like, a health club.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, and that would be perfect because where -- where my house is in Israel, so there's nothing like that there, they don't have like, a health club in that community.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So -- they just have like, people doing stuff in their houses.  But this would be perfect and I could open the health club and it would be -- that would be fun, I think that would be nice.
R:  Yeah, I always thought about like, a after school --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- center for kids because, you know, some parents have to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- work later in the evening --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and the babysitter charge extra after a certain time and a lotta people don't have any money for that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [several inaudible words] like, after day care center.  And if you misbehave you get suspended for a month, but you ab- --
L:  [inaudible]?
R:  Yes.
L:  That's --
R:  If they misbehave, you know, they get suspended for a month then they'll come back, because if you don't let them come back they'll be m- -- you know, getting more bad and stuff like that.  But strict rules, don't [inaudible] the rule you're suspended for a month [several inaudible words].  I always through about that, after school center --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for kids like, uh, seven to nine.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, that money --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- would do a lotta good.  Wanna keep most of it though because some people when they know you have too much money everybody wants to borrow, they don't wanna pay you back.
L:  Well, you have to -- you can't tell anybody you have the money. [LAUGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK] I would only tell my daughter, yes.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I would tell my daughter.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I tell her, even if I win the lotto, I have no relatives, just my daughter and she do whatever she wants with it.  Yeah, I can trust her.  Ever since she a little girl I teach her how to handle money and she know what to do.  Tell her, don't spend too much on clothes, use it to travel and go to the theater, to the movies.  See, you have enough clothes, you don't need to buy a suit every week.  I have some
