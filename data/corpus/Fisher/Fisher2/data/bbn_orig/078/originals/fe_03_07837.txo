L:  [NOISE] Hello?
R:  Hello.  This is Deborah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hi, I'm Jeff.
R:  And your name is?
L:  Jeff.
R:  What is it?
L:  [NOISE] Uh, Jeff.  J.E.F.F.
R:  Jeff?  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hi, Jeff.  How --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  are you?
L:  Hey.  Pretty --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- good.
R:  Well, if you were given a million dollars would you leave the US? [NOISE] 
L:  Um, [MN] probably.
R:  Would ya? [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] Well, I mean, does that mean permanently?
R:  I mean, would you, [NOISE] the way you feel --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- now --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- would you leave the US or not?
L:  Uh, permanently? 
R:  Yeah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- permanently.
L:  I don't know if you could do it f- -- with a million bucks.  I don't know.
R:  If you could do it for a million dollars you would --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- right?  Life is tough, isn't it?
L:  Actually, yeah -- yeah I probably would.  Yeah, I probably [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You're an adventurer?  You like to venture?
L:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  That's great.  Anyway [MN] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um --
L:  Where [MN] [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- and you wanna know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if I would leave permanently, right?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Well, I'm not thrilled with the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- United States --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [LAUGH] the way they're acting right now.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But I have to say I wouldn't leave.  Even though I always wanted to be a millionaire --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- which would mean I'd be a millionaire immediately, right?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH] [MN] But with inflation the way [NOISE] it goes --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't think it would last very long.  When you get done --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- paying for everything straight out.  And I would never be able to come back into the United States so, mm, probably not.
L:  [NOISE] You probably wouldn't?
R:  How's that sound?
L:  You wouldn't?
R:  Different?
L:  Even you though you could, like --
R:  Jess?  You there?
L:  You could, like, fly back, you know, whenever you wanted to.
R:  So, what are some experiences, hypothetically --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- speaking? [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  What are some experiences that you've had?  That interest you?
L:  [NOISE] In other places?  Uh, I would say, more like, lack of.
R:  You can speak regular to me.  I'm a regular person.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  If you met me you'd speak to me all day long.
L:  Oh.
R:  That kind of person.  So, [MN] whatever you say --
L:  [MN] [NOISE] 
R:  -- don't even worry --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- about it.  Just relax.  You sound nervous, a little nervous?
L:  I would say the same --
R:  I don't blame ya.  'Cause it's different speaking to somebody, right?
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  [PAUSE] But Jess --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, what are some of your experiences?
L:  Uh, I would say, [MN] the thing that would interest me in leaving would be the lack of experiences, not really.
R:  You're interested in what?
L:  Uh, I would say, the thing that would interest me in leaving would be the lack of experiences.
R:  I don't know.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Can you speak up a little bit? [PAUSE] [NOISE] The things that we -- the thing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- most -- most important thing that would interest you is what?
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] Okay, uh, I would say that, like, the thing that would interest --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- me the most in le- [NOISE] -- in leaving --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- would be --
R:  In anything, in general, like, [MN] hypothetically --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- speaking, what --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what is something that you enjoy in your life that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you've had an experience of already?
L:  Uh --
R:  Just generally speaking.
L:  You mean as far as --
R:  What is something you -- you've done in your life that you enjoy?
L:  [NOISE] You mean as far as something that would interest me in leaving?
R:  It [MN] doesn't have to be leaving.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Anything you've --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- done?
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.  Just for --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, chitchat a little bit.
L:  Oh, I don't know.  Well, uh, [MN] [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [NOISE] pretty much anything [NOISE] --
R:  [MN] Well, you don't have tell me if it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- something, like, risky.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But, we- -- like, what is something --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you've done in your life that you've enjoyed?
L:  [MN] Lived in Colorado. [MN]
R:  Oh, Colorado? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Aw --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I've been loo- --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- looking in a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- lot of different jobs --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in Colorado.  It seems like an interesting state, it really does.
L:  It's the best place [MN] --
R:  And would you like to live there?
L:  Huh?
R:  It's west -- out west.  Would you like to live there?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  You would?
L:  I actually did live there.
R:  Ah, maybe someday you will, huh?
L:  Uh, I know I will, actually. [MN]
R:  Yes. [LAUGH] You're ready to go there, right?  Yeah, I kinda --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like Colorado.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I've been looking up a lot of stuff about them. [MN] They have a lot of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- interesting jobs.  Also jobs from home I noticed.  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, they're --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a slower paced area. [NOISE] They're -- they're more slower paced.  New York State, where I'm from, New York area here --
L:  Oh.  You're -- you're from New York?
R:  -- it's faster pace.
L:  You're from New --
R:  In Colorado it's slower pace.  Is that what you like?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Relaxed?
L:  [MN] Well, I mean, I live in Texas now so [MN] --
R:  Uh-huh.  And that's --
L:  -- I don't think --
R:  -- slower paced too, right?
L:  Yeah.  Y- you can't get --
R:  And what?
L:  -- much slower than that.
R:  Yeah.  You're used to that? [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  What do you like about Colorado?
L:  [NOISE] I just -- I enjoy the mountains.  I mean [MN] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's -- it's --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- pretty much flat in Texas.
R:  You're in Texas and you're not crazy about Texas?
L:  Not particularly -- not particularly, no.
R:  I'm in New York City --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm [LAUGH] not particularly thrilled here but I would like to move to Pennsylvania.  That's where I would like to go.
L:  Yeah, uh, I've been there.
R:  It's --
L:  It's pretty nice.
R:  A place called Milford area, and it's nice.  Milford, [inaudible] area.
L:  It's really bohemian though --
R:  It's beautiful there.
L:  -- it's the only thing I don't like [MN] ...
R:  I like the country, it's more relaxed.  But I've never been to Texas or Colorado.  But lately I've been looking at Colorado with a lot of different things.  That's interesting, huh?
L:  [NOISE] What is? [MN]
R:  Colorado.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  They offer a lot of home jobs in Colorado.
L:  Yeah, they do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- They offer a lot of things at home.  Telemarketing, working for different --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- companies, stuff like [NOISE] that.
L:  [MN] [NOISE]
R:  And wha- -- you wanna know what I do, what I've experienced?
L:  Yeah, sure.
R:  Okay.  Uh, cosmetologist.
L:  Oh, cool.  Cool.
R:  Um, hairdresser.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Working with the feet.  Making them all pretty.  Putting designs on the nails and the feet.  Also --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- working as a makeup artist.  I studied with Paula Dorf, her makeup artist, ah, Barbra Streisand's makeup artist.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [MN] And I work with the computer --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a lot.  I'm Internet --
L:  Hey, cool [inaudible]
R:  -- savvy and that's the types of things that I do.
L:  Cool, cool.  I'm -- I'm a student right now but, like --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- [NOISE] studying [MN] a lot of computer stuff. [MN] Uh --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- going into graphic design. [MN]
R:  You want to build a computer someday?
L:  Do I?
R:  You want to build a computer someday?
L:  Aw, heck, way past that. [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh, do ya?
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I mean --
R:  You do, right?
L:  [MN] Yeah, I do that on the side.
R:  You do that on the side, uh-huh.  And you're good at it? [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, yeah.
R:  That's great. [PAUSE] What's the weather like where you are?
L:  Uh, [MN] real hot. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, huh?  Well, we're just starting to get in the eighties.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah, it's just going in the eighties.
L:  Yeah, I -- I would like for it to be that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that temperature here. [LAUGH] Unfortunately --
R:  Well, hypothetically speaking, um, [MN] in life, in general, everything you do is hypothetically speaking, really, if you want to know.  Everything that you do is hypothetical until it actually becomes theory, it's hypothetical, right?
L:  Right. [MN]
R:  Mhm. [PAUSE] And do you wanna [MN] -- you wanna have a family someday, children and all that?
L:  Uh, not really. [LAUGH]
R:  No?  You would rather be alone, huh?
L:  [NOISE] Well --
R:  Only --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- do that to you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- when you get in your forties, make sure you have somebody.  'Cause that's when you need [LAUGH] somebody.  Have your fun now --
L:  [MN] No, I mean, it's not that.
R:  -- but later on ...
L:  It's not that.  I'm just, like, not, you know?
R:  Not now, no.
L:  Yeah, exactly. [MN]
R:  How old are you?  Like --
L:  I'm twenty. [PAUSE]
R:  How old are you?
L:  I'm twenty.
R:  Twenty one?
L:  Nah, twenty. [MN]
R:  Twenty.  Wow, that's young.  I'm forty two.
L:  Oh, nice.
R:  Up there.  But I don't look it. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I would -- I react the same way as any twenty year old.  It's just the [MN] -- the difference between it is that [MN] there's so much more knowledge that you've got gained over the years, that you make different choices.
L:  Right.
R:  And when you're young, you're just, like, "Oh, wow!  I have my youth, I have everything.  I'm just gonna go for the gusto" you know [LAUGH] what I mean?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  That's the only difference, basically.  Just that we've been through life already and we see it differently in that sense.
L:  That's true.
R:  Because we've been through it already.  And you will say the same.
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  But you know, [MN] hypothetically speaking, you just enjoy what you're doing.  That -- that's it. [PAUSE] [NOISE] And what are some other goals you have in life?
L:  Um, [MN] well, I don't really have any, you know, super long term goals or anything, I mean --
R:  Not yet.
L:  Just whatever --
R:  Is there something that you'd like to do though?
L:  Wherever I end up.
R:  [LAUGH] You're the venturer, right?  I said you were the venturer. [PAUSE]
L:  So, you wouldn't take the million and go overseas?
R:  No.  No, and the reason that is is bec- -- I guess because I'm used to it.  I'm used to the United States.  I'm used to the area.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think that if you're used to something you always want to go back, and I would want to go back, even if it's for five minutes, you know?  I would wanna see -- see it again, you know what I'm saying?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or feel it again, whatever.  And actually, we're not allowed to, right?  We have to take the million dollars and never go --
L:  Well --
R:  -- back, that's the part.
L:  I mean, if you're -- if it's, uh, if it's the fact that you're used to it that would keep you here.  I'd say, you know, but there's a lot of places that are very westernized.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, you know, [MN] you wouldn't feel too far removed from your natural -- or from your -- from what you're used to.
R:  Well, that's true in a way, when you think [NOISE] about it.  It is -- that is true.  Once [MN] -- and once I get used to some place else, it wouldn't matter, right?
L:  Yeah.  I don't -- yeah, I don't think it would.
R:  Mhm.  That's an interesting thought. [LAUGH] You've got me thinking. [LAUGH] I'm --
L:  Yeah, I'd probably want to go to, uh, New Zealand or something like that.
R:  You want to go to New Zealand?
L:  Yeah.  They've got like --
R:  Like, Australia, New Zealand area?
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, not really Australia, more [MN] just New Zealand.
R:  New Zealand is more where the ice is, yeah, that's right.  Where they have those, um, uh, certain kind of sheep.
L:  In New Zealand?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I think they --
R:  They're known for a lot of sheep and certain types of stuff [MN] and you ha- -- and it's very cold area, right?
L:  Um [MN] --
R:  Very cold?
L:  I'm not sure whether -- whether it's --
R:  'Cause I know they always have New Zealand -- [MN] I always think of those big fur coats -- they have those special coats that they make, and gloves and all that.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Out of the insides and the fur from the sheep, from the lamb.
L:  [MN] I guess I haven't seen those.
R:  That's from New Zeal- -- yeah, that's what I think of when you say --
