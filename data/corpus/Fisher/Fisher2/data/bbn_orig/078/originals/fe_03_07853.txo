R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hi.  I'm Kristin. [NOISE]
L:  Kristin, I'm Sam Steward.  How are you today?
R:  I'm doing just fine.  How about you?
L:  Good.
R:  Good.
L:  Good.
R:  [MN] So, you wanna get started? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yes, let's -- let's do it. [MN]
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, [MN] [NOISE] have you thought about opening your own business?
R:  Well, my husband mentions it to me every once in a while. [MN] I'm -- right now I'm a stay at home mom [MN] and I have a degree in education of the deaf and hard of hearing [NOISE] and I taught for four years before we had kids [MN] and now I'm a stay at home mom with them. [MN] But I like to do a lot of crafts and I do a lot of cake decorating and things like that [MN] and my husband has often said to me, "You can make money doing that". [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah, I'll tell ya, there's a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- cake business and a couple --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of cake businesses in --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- our area that, uh, you just can't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- believe how much, uh, you know like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Easter and Christmas and things like that.  You can't -- you have to wait [MN] -- wait in [LAUGH] line about, uh --
R:  Sure. [NOISE]
L:  -- thirty minutes.
R:  And even, I mean, if you look at the supermarkets, the kind of decorating that they do anymore is just so generic.  They're -- they put the figurines on top of the cakes or they [MN], you know, use the computer printout papers. [MN] But nothing's building it up with icing anymore.
L:  [MN] No that's true.  That's true.
R:  So, I guess that would the one area that I might be interested in [NOISE] starting a business. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I, um, I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- actually [LAUGH] have my own business so [LAUGH] ...
R:  Oh, do you? [LAUGH] And what's that in?
L:  [LAUGH] Management consulting.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Uh, and I've had that for about, uh, fifteen or sixteen years.  Now -- now I'd say they would seem like their business isn't that good so [LAUGH] ...
R:  [MN] [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  But the one thing that was, uh, interesting there, if money wasn't an object.  So, there are lots of [NOISE] -- lots of neat businesses that you could, uh, [MN] open --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if you didn't have to worry about, uh, the financing and such.
R:  Right.  Now what were you doing before you started up a business? [NOISE]
L:  I was working as a management consultant for someone else.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, you know, you get the experience there and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, uh --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- [MN] and do that.  But, um, I think there'd be some neat, um, you know, travel type businesses that you could, um, open up.  You know, take people on different tours and things like that.
R:  Sure.
L:  [MN] We went on a, um, [NOISE] a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- barge trip, uh, in -- in France that, uh, this guy had started up as a business which was very --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- very nice.
R:  Uh-huh. [PAUSE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Now, did you find that you wanted to start up your own business because you could make better money at it or was it a management kind of thing that your superiors were putting a lot of [MN] restrictions and a lot of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- extra hassle?  That's what's happening to my sister in law. [MN] She's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a physical therapist --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and she works out of a hospital and it's gotten to be so much bureaucracy that she decided just start her own business and -- and you know, do it on her own.
L:  [MN] Yeah, it was a little of both, really.  Uh, and then some of it was -- was luck.  I was fortunate to get a, um, [MN] contract with the utility around here which I -- I didn't work for them, you know, all my time but I -- I could work about half my time [MN] on different projects with them for --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [MN] maybe seven or eight years.  So, that worked out -- that was a good way to get started --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and build some, um, [MN] some cash and whatever.
R:  Did you transfer over some of your previous clients or did you have to get a whole new clientele?
L:  [MN] Um, no, it's mostly new clients, uh --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, it's -- it's sort of tricky stealing a client --
R:  Sure! [LAUGH]
L:  -- somebody else but, uh [MN] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but certainly that's a way a lot of 'em, uh, [MN] a lot of 'em start.
R:  Right.
L:  [MN] But, um, [MN] you know, there are a lot of disadvantages in -- in, uh -- in owning it, too, for -- for sure.  You know, the people and the payroll and all of that that [NOISE] you have to worry about.
R:  Right. [MN] Yeah, I do some freelance sign language interpreting, too, so I have to file --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- taxes.
L:  That's a phone -- my other line's ringing, I'll just ignore it.
R:  Okay. [MN]
L:  [MN]
R:  So, I have to, um --
L:  [NOISE] Hold on a second --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- let me to try to figure out how --
R:  Okay. [LAUGH]
L:  -- to turn off the ringer.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] There it goes. [NOISE] Okay. [NOISE]
R:  That's all right.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [MN] So, I have to, uh, file taxes as if I owned my own business for what I do with [NOISE] my freelance interpreting.  And boy, the first couple of years trying to figure -- I always do my own taxes.  I just --
L:  Right.  So, you file a Schedule C.?
R:  Yes!  And just trying to figure it all out and what I had to claim and [NOISE] [MN] what I could, you know, use as expenses that I could write off, all that kind of stuff. [MN] It -- it took a couple of years till I got it right.  You [LAUGH] know, I think those first couple returns -- [MN] well, the one I -- I know I did pay in too much and we have a family friend who is, um, [MN] he's actually the -- a pastor at our church.  He's in charge of -- of [NOISE] financial ministry.
L:  Right.
R:  And so he went through all of it with me and got me a couple hundred bucks back that I'd overpaid the year before.
L:  [MN] Well, that's good.  'Cause you have to put in your inventory right? [MN] Which is sort of funny [LAUGH] especially if you don't have any --
R:  Exactly!
L:  -- any inventory.
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  But, uh, [MN] yeah, it's an experience.  I guess really though you're probably better off [MN] -- I -- I do that myself but you're probably better off having somebody [LAUGH] else do it for you.
R:  Yeah.  Probab- -- I'm such a tightwad, you know?  To pay anybody to do anything that I feel I can do [LAUGH] myself. [MN]
L:  [MN] Yeah, [MN] um, I don't know, I guess there's some other good businesses that you could, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you could, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- start at.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [MN] Something to do w- -- anything to do with sports would be fun, if you wanted something as sort of a p- -- a past time rather than as a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- fulltime, you know, fulltime job --
R:  Right.
L:  -- which is what they're saying, "Money not an object".
R:  Uh-huh. [PAUSE] Yeah, I don't know where else I'd wanna branch out.  Um, [MN] well, I do a lot of teaching, too.  I guess, your own kind of tutorial business --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- there's always a market for that.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  People [MN] -- and then, um, especially if you can do it on the, um, one the Internet.  Altho- although I guess with the sign language and that you can't really [LAUGH] -- that -- that --
R:  [MN] Well, I'll tell you, with the web cams and stuff that they have now, you know, that's really opened up a whole new --
L:  Really?
R:  -- avenue. [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I guess it has.  And then, um -- [MN] yeah, I never thought of that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I guess th- -- people are thinking all the time of different businesses.
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  For a period of time I had a, um, [MN] a pay fax machine like a payphone in a mall -- in some malls.
R:  Okay.
L:  Hotels. [MN] And that, you know, I guess I about broke even on that but it, you know, it never -- it -- that was maybe, um, fifteen or sixteen years ago.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Which was before people had email and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, when the fax was really the only way to, um, to, you know, send documents.
R:  Sure.
L:  [MN] But s- -- with the email that sort of went away.  I don't -- [MN] people don't use their fax machines very much any more.
R:  No. [LAUGH] No.  The few things that I've had to fax -- I guess, well my -- with my modem I was able to do it.  Um, I had a fax modem that I could do it over my computer, too, but [MN] I never ended up using that much.  Now, I can just save documents as PDF files and --
L:  Yeah, it's really -- it's --
R:  Send --
L:  -- really sharp.
R:  -- them on their way. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, and I guess all those people that made the dot -- had the dot com, there're not many of those, uh --
R:  No!
L:  -- [MN] making money.
R:  No.  And I -- I'll tell ya, they really looked like they were on the rise there for a while and everybody jumped on that bandwagon and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it just kinda [LAUGH] ...
L:  Well, some of those businesses were pretty stupid.  I mean, they didn't have any real reason to, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to be around.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, [NOISE] so, I guess though you look at the people like, uh, Gates that -- that s- started a business in --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, uh, the people that started Apple and, you know, and even the people that started Hewlett Packard, that started out sort of in somebody's garage a --
R:  Right.
L:  -- few years ago.  Or many years ago.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [MN] But then you look at some of the other ones that, uh, like IBM, h- ho- -- you know, how far down that's gone and -- and -- and Xerox, how, you know, poorly they've done when you'd think at one point there was nothing that could go wrong with those, uh, those businesses.
R:  Right.  Yeah, I mean, they really looked like they were going to be the superpowers for many years to come. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, it's funny, I guess that, um, [MN] when they s- -- talk about Gates starting out that IBM just really didn't even want to be bothered with, uh, that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and they -- they -- that's why they gave him so much --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- such generous terms in terms of supplying a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- product of a [several inaudible words].
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE] Yeah, I wonder how many people, you know, down through the years in business have looked back at -- at simple decisions that they've made [NOISE] and just, you know, shuddered at the ramifications of not staying onboard with someone who ended up, [MN] you know, going to top, as it were.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I mean, i- if you look at, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [MN] there was one guy that -- that -- actually Gates --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- was trying to hook --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- up the IBM people --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- with, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- with this software developer --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the guy didn't want to put on a tie or something so [MN] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- he didn't want to meet the IBM guy [LAUGH] so Gates said, well, he would do it himself. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Wow.
L:  And that, you know, that's -- that's that.  Well, I guess it's like, uh, Peter Best, the guy that Ringo Starr replaced. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay. [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] 
R:  [MN] Yeah.  Wow.
L:  [MN] Um --
R:  [NOISE] [PAUSE]
L:  But I don't know what other businesses --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- uh, that are -- that are being formed out there.
R:  Yeah, I don't know.  I -- you know what I've -- I've heard of a lot lately is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- people who will do computer, [NOISE] you know, maintenance or even just come in and help you with whatever your problems are in the home.
L:  Sort of like a tutor.  Yeah, that's a good --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- idea because if you don't know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- how to, uh, [MN] I mean it's really frustrating if you don't know how to do something.  I -- I get into that whenever I go visit my brother. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] [MN] Well, you figure, you have all these IT people in corporations [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but when you're a- --
