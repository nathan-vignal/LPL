R:  Roxanne --
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello, Roxanna from Dallas.
L:  Oh, hi.  Keith from Albuquerque, New Mexico.
R:  [NOISE] Hello.
L:  How are you doing?
R:  Hi, how are you doing?
L:  Oh, running around, uh, at work, uh, trying to get some things done, but --
R:  Yes, so what do you think about that topic, uh, the million dollars?
L:  Uh, a million bucks and never see my friend again?
R:  Yeah, never talk --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- to them. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, well I -- I -- uh, a million bucks, uh, I -- I'd have to say, "Bye", [LAUGH] to be honest with ya. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly, that's what I'm going for --
L:  [LAUGH] I --
R:  -- it's kind of a silly question, I think I would rather take the one million dollars even if I don't talk to my best friend again.
L:  Yeah, uh, I think the last question answers for a million bucks would you leave the country and never come back again?  And that was, "Uh, maybe", but, uh, a million bucks --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and never see Peter again? [LIPSMACK]
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- I -- I think he would understand, he would, you know --
R:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, when we were in -- we were in high school we had a saying, uh, I said it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in college too --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- "Money talks, bullshit walks and small change rides the bus".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, uh -- and, uh, he -- I was -- I was a manager of a store --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- uh, and he, uh, had -- had quit his job and, you know, had been living off his savings for a while and, uh --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- he called me up one day and he said, "Money talks, and I've run out of things to say", so ...
R:  Exactly, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And besides with the one million bucks you can find lots of friends. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well, I actually, uh -- uh, a lot of people with a, uh -- it's harder to find true friends --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when you have real money because, uh, people act like they're friends but they really --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- want -- want your money or your businesses.  All right, uh -- uh -- we -- we -- we -- we'll improvise on their question.
R:  [LAUGH] That's true.
L:  Uh, uh, well, I --
R:  But I would take the one million bucks and --
L:  Oh, yeah, one million bucks is no problem, but how about a hundred thousand dollars?
R:  Oh, I would take that too. [LAUGH]
L:  A hundred thousand dollars?
R:  I'm in need of money, yeah.
L:  Oh, all right, uh, five thousand bucks, let's -- let's find your -- let's find out what the threshold is.
R:  Five thousand?
L:  Oh -- five thousand, never talk to your friend --
R:  Yeah, I'd take it, I need the money.
L:  You -- you -- okay.  See I -- for five thousand I -- I -- I could, I'd -- I'd -- it --
R:  I would -- I would and if it's a million dollars of course I would take it.
L:  I'd, uh -- I'd -- I'd have to say, no, um, I -- I -- I -- my -- my friend Peter's worth  at least five grand, I'd want -- I don't know, a hundred grand?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Uh, I'd -- I -- I might even say no to that.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Two fifty --
R:  No, no, you wouldn't -- you would say no to a hundred grand?
L:  Well, I -- I -- I -- I think our financial situations are a little different --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, I -- I -- I'm thirty seven and, uh, my wife and I -- my wife doesn't work, I have a pretty good job, uh, it pays me fairly well --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, uh, we have no debt other than our house.  Uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we save our money, uh, pretty religiously and we just bought a -- a brand new SUV and we paid cash for it.  So, uh, you know --
R:  Okay, that's pretty good --
L:  -- so, you know, you get --
R:  -- but you could use it for a vacation or something. [NOISE]
L:  Uh, well, I -- but I've -- but I've done it -- but I've been on those vacations.  I've been to, you know -- on cruises throughout the Caribbean and, you know, all that stuff, so for me five thousand --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- bucks is not, uh, a tremendous amount of money.
R:  No, not five thousand, I meant a hundred grand.
L:  A hundred grand I would say -- probably --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'd probably say no to the hundred grand, to be honest with ya.  Uh, I mean, like, uh --
R:  Oh, you would say no to that?
L:  I -- I -- I would -- I would say, "Keep your hundred grand, I'll keep my friend".  Now, if you said --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- "Two -- two hundred and fifty or a half million?" --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I would have to seriously consider it.
R:  [NOISE] Okay, you would go for the money? [NOISE]
L:  I would -- I would have to think about going for the money.  Uh, I'd --
R:  Okay, mhm --
L:  -- yeah, I -- I didn't say --
R:  -- but what about -- for a million you would go for the ...?
L:  A mill- -- a million -- a million bucks, uh -- the last person I -- Pete -- if Peter found 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- out I gave up a million bucks, to, like, talking him --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he wouldn't be my friend any more anyways, 'cause he'd think I was stupid. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  He'd say, "Take that -- take the million" so, uh --
R:  But -- but wh- what if there's -- there's a slightly different thing -- what if you can't even say that you won a million dollars and that you were going to pick him over the million dollars?  You just wouldn't be able to talk to him or even let him know that --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- would that change or would it stay the same?
L:  Uh, that would stay the same, I -- I wou- -- I would still -- I would still take the million bucks regardless --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of whether or not he knew or not, uh, I'd --
R:  That you were taking the money?
L:  I would take the million, yeah.  But, uh, you know, for a hundred grand, nah, uh, I'll be honest with you, I -- I'm, you know, I -- I --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- sometime -- I'm going to make -- I'm going to make about that much this year --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- not a -- yeah, not -- not a huge deal, so I've done --
R:  Oh, okay, what's you occupation?
L:  Uh, I work for an insurance company, I'm in the --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- marketing department, yeah.  So, if you ever have a chance check into insurance, think about it.  You own a house or you own a car, you need us --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we're the -- it's the -- it's the largest industry in the world.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  For my -- that's -- I got both my brothers into the business --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and both of them will tell you that's -- what, yeah, you know, I mean -- say the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the same thing, it, uh --
R:  I can understand then about the -- the ten -- the twenty thousand and all that --
L:  Yeah, so ...
R:  -- it -- it -- because best friends are hard -- not even money can -- can buy them.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And -- and I've -- and I've known Peter since, uh, the sixth grade, so ...
R:  Oh, that's -- my, that's a very long friendship.
L:  Yeah, we've been friends -- actually, I -- I've been friends with Peter longer than I've not been friends with Peter, so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and, you know, it -- it's the same thing for my other good friends, you know, I've known --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- them all since, uh, high school, I mean, I, uh -- I -- I -- it's kind of weird my -- my wife's the same way though, her best friend, they went to grade school together.  I mean, we're talking, like, kindergarten --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they went to kindergarten and they were in the same kindergarten class, so, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I guess, I -- it depends on the level of friendship you have and all that stuff, but it's still --
R:  [NOISE] Yes.
L:  -- a million bucks.  Sorry, Peter. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I mean, it depends on the person too, I mean, since I'm just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a student and I'm just working, I think I would --
L:  Right.
R:  -- use even -- even twenty grand. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, well, and -- and -- and I suppose, you know, that cou- --
R:  Or the five thousand grand I would -- [LAUGH]
L:  It would -- well, when I was, uh -- when I was working my way through college and I was making four fifty an hour --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, which was minimum wage back then, uh --
R:  Yeah, I work eight --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- fifty an hour now, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Now -- yeah -- I -- that's -- that's -- that's -- that's sounds that -- you remember you're making --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- twice what I was making, course then again, prob- -- I probably could have bought twice as much --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- with my four --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- fifty, but, uh, uh --
R:  Mhm, that was back then --
L:  But --
R:  -- times have changed. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah, they have.
R:  [NOISE]
L:   Uh -- and the thing is, also -- is, uh, you know, also -- I suppose, depends on the quality of -- of the friend too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, Peter and I -- you know, I mean -- you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, first dates, you know --
R:  He -- he's been there with you through toug- -- through thick and thin, right?
L:  Oh, yeah, and believe me there is some times when it was pretty damn thin too. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We -- we -- we -- we -- there were -- there were -- I mean, there was a good six months to a year where we didn't talk to each other 'cause we were that upset with each other, but we, you know --
R:  Yes --
L:  -- came back.
R:  -- it's like a family, you know, you -- you don't talk with somebody for a few months and you go back and -- [NOISE]
L:  Right.  Oh, no, we were -- we were -- we -- we -- we got in a big old fight --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we were working together too --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.
L:  -- and, so -- so, we --
R:  At your insurance company?
L:  No, he, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- he -- we were working at a furniture store at the time --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and we got in --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know -- you know, you're nineteen and, you know, you think one thing, I think another thing and then, you know, next thing you know, you're not talking --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to each other, so and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it took about six months when we finally, you know, started talking again and we finally agreed that both of us we- -- had behaved like, you know, butt heads and, you know --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- [LAUGH] and -- and, uh, you know -- and hopeless[?] --
R:  And just go on.
L:  Yeah, just go on.  So, uh -- so, I mean, how long is -- this friend that we're talking about, I mean, how long have you known this person?
R:  Oh, I've known him -- with him -- since high school basically -- since tenth grade.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh-huh, and, you know --
R:  So, I mean, I -- I -- this person there, you know, I -- I don't know, I probably -- if I didn't have him in my life I would be like, "Oh, you know, this really sucks, I don't have no one to talk to" and everything --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but with a million dollars, I'd probably, uh, take it.
L:  Yeah, I -- like I said, I've -- I've known Peter for -- since -- what -- third --
R:  Yeah, I haven't known anybody that long from the grade --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- school. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well, sixth grade and then -- and then you, like, said --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, you would -- still for a million --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- bucks, uh -- I guess, I -- I -- I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it'd be different, you know, I mean -- I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if the question was if you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- had to kill somebody for a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- million bucks or, you know --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- harm him in some way, not --
R:  Kill, no. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I'm just thinking, you know, for a million bucks --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, you know, i- if I just had to walk away and never see him again --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- okay, I could do that, but if I had to harm him or his family in some way no --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I -- I couldn't take the million bucks.  I mean, it's not -- not --
R:  Yeah -- no, I mean -- yeah, I wouldn't probably do that either, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- besides I'd probably get caught and -- and go to jail or something. [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I -- I'm one of those people every time I've broken the speed limit --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it seems there's a cop --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- right there or so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- um, I -- I definitely would be the one, you know, on America's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Most Wanted or something at least.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So --
R:  Yes.
L:  But, uh -- no, I'm, er --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I -- that's, uh, an -- definitely --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and some of the questions they've asked have been very interesting and -- I don't know, the --
R:  Mhm, so you've known him since kindergarten?
L:  Uh, no, my wife has known he- -- hi- -- her best friend since kindergarten, I've known him since the sixth --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- grade, so --
R:  Oh, okay, yes.
L:  -- you know, it's -- it --
R:  But you all graduated in the same high school and everything?
L:  Same high school.
R:  You all grew -- you all went to the same schools together?
L:  Uh, both went to -- we both went to the same community college although he -- he took a year off, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and -- and worked and then, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we both graduated from Arizona State --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- University, uh, about two years apart.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  We didn't have any classes together --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and we didn't really see each other on campus or anything, 'cause at, like, ASC there's a hundred and twenty five thousand, uh, students registered.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, you --
R:  Yes, I'm sure it is, uh-huh.
L:  So, you don't -- you know, you don't really run into people but, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- no, we -- you know, I mean, uh, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'm his -- godfather of his son, I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, the --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- so, it -- I mean, it's -- it's a pretty deep sort of --
R:  Yeah, that's good to -- to be with a friendship like that for a long time.
L:  Yeah, well, I mean, you can talk about pretty much though anything, and you've -- you've got a context to relate it to.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, so, when I say, you know, "I'm telling you I've got a child on the way", and, you know, of course that makes you feel well -- you know what -- "I'm going to be dead one day, I need to take care of my kid".  And, you know, y- you don't -- really don't talk about death with somebody and your fears of it and all that stuff, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if you've got a friend like that you can.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I --
L:  So --
R:  -- so he's probably like a brother to you? [NOISE]
L:  He -- he -- he's -- he's about -- yeah, I would say I was, um -- I'm not --
