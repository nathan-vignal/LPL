L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  Uh, my name is Devorah, I'm in New York City.
L:  Uh, my name is Roland and I am in -- I guess the closest place is Houston, Texas.
R:  Are you near Houston in the countryside somewhere?
L:  Well, I grew up in Houston but I live in La Porte, right on the Bay -- on Galveston Bay.
R:  Oh.
L:  Right down the road from Houston.
R:  Wow.
L:  Where in Houston -- where in New York do you live?
R:  Manhattan, right in the middle of Manhattan.
L:  Wow, cool.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I live about a half a block off the East River.
L:  Wow.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah, by the river.
L:  Okay, what's your name again?
R:  Devorah.
L:  What?
R:  Devorah, it's kind of like Deborah but it has a V in it like victory, Devorah.
L:  Devorah?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  Okay and you're Roland.  So, they told me that we have to talk about the topic or they won't pay us, so we got to talk about time travel.
L:  And -- and we get ten bucks, this is my first time to do this so --
R:  Well, we got to -- they say we can't talk about the study we've got to talk about time travel, that's what we've got to do so would you go back in time if you had a choice?
L:  Uh, yeah, I guess so.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I think if I was -- were able to go back in time I would be, uh, you know, having -- I'm thirty three now --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, uh, I think I would be even more outspoken --
R:  Really.
L:  -- about -- maybe that's just me, I'm kind of the rebellious type, but, uh --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I would be outs- -- m- more outspoken about certain things and I'm proud of myself that I'm to the point where I -- I stand up for what I believe in.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But --
R:  What do you believe in?
L:  Oh, just at work, I -- I'm a -- I'm a high school teacher.
R:  Uh-huh, what do you teach?
L:  I teach geography.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, uh -- and I'm also a, uh -- will be -- will be teaching junior college in --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- sociology --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and that's kind of -- the person that does that gave me the -- how did you find out about this, anyway?
R:  [NOISE] This study?  Well, I'll tell you at the end 'cause as -- they told me if we tal- -- they said people tend to talk about the study and they won't pay them --
L:  Oh, really --
R:  -- they listen to the tape.
L:  -- each ten bucks?
R:  Huh?
L:  Okay, I see.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, they won't -- they don't want us to do that.  Uh-uh --
L:  No, I would just be -- I don't know -- I don't know --
R:  Can you think of specific times and --
L:  To tell you the truth though, I think -- I -- I think an- and when you think about it I think a- all the things in your life that really shape you, in retrospect, I don't know that I'd want to change a thing.  I mean, I would -- I would --
R:  Really.
L:  -- not be the person I am.
R:  Well, good for you. [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know, what about you?
R:  Yeah, I would. [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I have a whole bunch of stuff I'd go back and do differently, for sure.  Um, I -- you know, I -- I don't know that I would be the same person I am now, um, and so, some of the things I have learned I might not learn, but some of them I learned real hard [LAUGH] and I would just as soon have an easier, uh, time of it and, uh --
L:  I mean -- but yeah -- I mean we deal with crappy situations in life but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, don't you think if we hadn't that we -- we -- I mean, if we didn't have these situations to deal with in life that we -- we would- -- they wouldn't forge us and make us and, you know --
R:  They do forge us and make us, I just -- would just as soon have done some things differently, I really would.  And, I -- I -- you know, I was somebody who, uh, was, when necessary, outspoken and, uh -- you know, there's -- there's -- there's a fee, [LAUGH] you know.  I don't think I would change that, I -- I think that that's, you know, kind of a prime value.  But, um, there are things that I, um -- some of it just has to do with, uh, uh -- I didn't really get a lot of support and so I had a certain confidence that I -- you know, about undertaking certain things that I didn't have, you know.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I got -- actually, I'll tell you one thing that occurred to me tonight, uh, quite a while ago I was offered the job of, um, [NOISE] being the cook for the Big Apple Circus, you know, when they were off wherever they were off -- it- it's a wonderful small circus and they were off somewhere else and I think I -- they gave me the job 'cause they liked me and I looked them in the eye at some point and said, you know, "I'm twenty nine, it's my last chance to run away and join the circus" and that -- that was it, I was in, you know.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  The only thing is, I wasn't sure I could do it and I talked to a friend of mine, that I had done a summer cooking tour with once, and she said, "Oh, no, you can't do that. You won't -- you don't -- you won't be able to do it, don't take that job, you can't do it". [LAUGH] And I just -- I just sort of exed myself out of the situation because I figured she knew what she was talking about.  But, you know what, she didn't [LAUGH] --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- and it would have been a terrific opportunity to do something unusual with the kind of people that, you know, I wouldn't otherwise have an opportunity to meet and, you know, [NOISE] they become people -- some of them wind up staying with you forever, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I didn't do that and, uh -- and I wanted to be dancer and, uh, there were certain points where I would have had to, um, make different choices than I made and I just sort of didn't have -- I didn't really have the sense anybody was backing me up.  And I knew I'd have to go through a lot of grief to get there, from people that mattered to me and I just kind of didn't.  I -- it's -- you know, if I knew I was a great -- you know, the greatest thing on earth, I would have done it but I didn't know that, so -- so I didn't do it and, uh, I'm not happy about that. [LAUGH]
L:  So, what do you do now?
R:  [NOISE] Mm?
L:  What are do you doing now?
R:  [NOISE] Well, uh, I just star- -- I -- I was, uh, running a program [NOISE] for people who are looking to unclutter their lives and their homes and their possessions and I just stopped doing that a few months ago and I'm waiting to see what the next thing will be. [NOISE]
L:  Uh.
R:  So, that's the story but I -- my -- my family -- my mother was a high school librarian, I know about high school teaching and I have a lot of relatives who did that.  I had an uncle who was a -- [SIGH] uh, the head of a maths department in a high school and another -- his son is doing the same thing now.  So -- a lot of teachers in my family.
L:  Right, well me too, that's why I became a teacher.
R:  Yeah.  So, anyway, time travel, so can you remember certain times when you wished you had -- had spoken out more?
L:  Yeah, oh definitely.
R:  Like when?
L:  I think I think of that because of, uh, being un- -- getting my ma- -- short of one course I had a Master's in sociology --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and so I -- I see things -- I think anybody -- if you know anything about sociology or anything --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- uh, you see things differently than other people, I think that's why I say that, so --
R:  [LAUGH] You see things differently than other people who studied sociology?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And how so?  What do you --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  What do you see differently?
L:  I -- I don't know, I mean, if this -- the study of group behavior -- peoples, how they act, I think --
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  -- uh, I don't know.  I just see things in a different way but more so now than in the past.  So, I don't know that I could say that I would change any -- I mean, go back and change anything because in the past I really didn't -- I rea- -- I don't know -- I didn't know what I know -- knew now -- I know now.
R:  I get you, I hear that.
L:  You know, so --
R:  Did -- when I first heard time travel, I thought they were talking, like, you know, Jules Verne kind of -- HG Wellsy kind of thing.
L:  I did too.
R:  You did too.  But, um -- but in my --
L:  I did too.  Maybe this -- maybe I would do this, maybe I would, you know, go after a girl I hadn't gone after, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- because I'm -- I'm a single guy so ... [LAUGH]
R:  Right, and me, I would -- I would have dumped some people real fast, that I --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- wasted an awful lot of time thinking I had to, like, work this out instead of just thinking, "Oh, jerk, write this guy off. [LAUGH] Don't need to fix him, don't need to fix the situation, just leave".
L:  Right.
R:  You know, [LAUGH] so that's one of the things I would definitely -- and there certainly some -- some choices that, uh -- or -- or a lack of choices along the way that I made that I'm not happy about at all, not at all.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, uh [LAUGH] -- so I don't know that this whole thing about I wouldn't be the person I am -- there's certain things about being the person I am [LAUGH] I would change too, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so I don't know about all that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Anyway, so I found out about this through an ad in the paper, I saw it --
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I got an email from this person I met who's like a college instructor or something --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- telling me about it --
R:  Uh-huh.  This is my last call, um --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, and actually I -- I -- the last couple of times I called they als- -- they also had hypothetical situations, so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um --
L:  I'm -- I'm wondering, uh -- I think I've just read something about this before, I'm wondering if it has something to do with the study -- I think they just want to get all -- you know, different parts of the country and just to hear your -- your dialect, your voice.
R:  Yeah, it's voice recognition software.
L:  Right.
R:  Right.  But we have to talk about the subject -- I -- they t- -- were very clear with me, they won't pay you if don't talk about the subject.  So --
L:  Really?
R:  Really.  They -- you have to talk about the subject.
L:  So, have you not gotten paid 'cause you got off the subject?
L:  No, we have to talk about time travel, we can't talk about the study. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, let's talk about this in relation to time travel. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  So, in relation to time travel would I have made a different choice?  No, I made very good choices [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- as far as this is concerned, every time I'm on the phone with somebody I say we've got to talk about the subject 'cause I don't want to not get paid for this, you know? [MN] So ...
L:  It's only ten bucks.
R:  It's only ten bucks but it's, uh --
L:  Have you got --
R:  -- way late -- it's way late in New York right now, it's almost midnight.
L:  Have you gotten paid any money yet?
L:  No, they pay you six weeks later I think, so ...
L:  Okay.
R:  But it's -- it's way late and I'm on the phone although I -- I would love to talk about Texas and Houston and Galveston Bay but I don't think we're allowed to really go there.  So, I never wa- -- I -- I can -- I can -- in time travel, looking backward, I'd never get to go to Texas, I lived in Colorado and I could've, you know, gone southward.
L:  I was about to say this is -- I'm fascinated by this because I teach geography and I talk -- I talk so much about language and dialect --
R:  Do you?
L:  Yes, and people so often tell me I don't sound like I'm from Texas --
R:  Texas, not --
L:  -- or Houston, they say I'm from the mid west but I've grown up here all my life.
R:  Yeah, well they always tell me I don't sound like I'm from New York.
L:  And you don't sound like you're from New York.
R:  Yeah, but that's because people are expecting, uh, um, a caricature, you know.  Some people in -- you know, like, I'm supposed to talk like this, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- something like that.
L:  That's like Jersey.
R:  That's Jersey, you're right.  That was Jersey. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh, or like the Bronx or something -- that's what comes --
R:  No, that's Jersey, you -- you got it the first time.  But, um, I -- I never did talk that way and nobody in my family does, so ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] So, anyway, um -- other choices, if I had gone back -- could go back and change something, what I would have changed.
L:  I -- yeah, I -- you know, it's really kind of personal, I've never met you before --
R:  Yeah, but that's the point of the --
