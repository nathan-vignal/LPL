R:  Hello, my name is Sam.
L:  Hi, my name is [PAUSE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Is it better if I speak on [MN] -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on the regular handset?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello?
L:  Are y- -- are you on a cellphone?
R:  No, I was on a -- a -- [MN] a speaker phone but I'm a s- -- hand set now.  Is this --
L:  Okay, yeah, that's --
R:  -- better?  Can you -- can you hear me pretty well?
L:  -- that's better.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yes.
R:  My name's Sam.
L:  How you doing, Sam?  I'm Sabrina.
R:  Sabrina?  Good, good.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  What did you think about the, uh, leaving the United States for a million dollars?
L:  [MN] For a million dolla- -- [MN] I didn't understand, do we have to leave forever?
R:  I think so.  It wasn't clear but I think it probably would --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- be forever.
L:  Um, I don't know.  Well, if I -- if I did leave I would probably go to France. [MN]
R:  France?
L:  [LIPSMACK] And -- yes.
R:  I've been to --
L:  And what I would [NOISE] --
R:  -- France.
L:  Excuse me?
R:  I've been to France; it's a good country.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yup.
L:  [MN] Yeah, and --
R:  [NOISE]
L: -- I'd probably just pursue my modeling career out there --
R:  Oh, tha- --
L:  -- 'cause that's what I'm doing out here, so --
R:  That's good.
L:  -- that's what I'd probably --
R:  [MN] I think I'd go to Ireland.  That's 'cause we wouldn't have any --
L:  Ireland?
R:  You would have any trouble with the language.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Although they do talk funny over there.
L:  Uh-huh. [NOISE] Wow, okay. [NOISE] Are you -- do you have any Irish [NOISE] in you?
R:  Yeah, [MN] my an- ancestors are from --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Ireland.
L:  Oh.
R:  But -- but a couple [MN] -- you know, three --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or four generations --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- away.
L:  Mhm. [MN] Well, okay.  Well, I'm mixed with Irish, but I -- I've never been to Ireland.
R:  What, uh, what would you miss the most about the United States?
L:  [NOISE] Um, well, since I've never been to France, I sure it would be the food, I'm sure it's a lot different. [MN] The food, um, [LIPSMACK] my family and [NOISE] -- and [NOISE] -- and [MN] [NOISE] I don't know.  What would you miss?
R:  I think the food is probably number one.
L:  Yeah.
R:  If they didn't have, uh, the cable now --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you'd miss, uh, you'd miss the entertainment of the movies but now, uh --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- now you can see that all over the world.  So, that's not a big, uh --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- a big problem.
L:  Yeah, definitely. [MN]
R:  Did, um -- what about the [MN] -- then what would you miss the least?
L:  What I would -- the least about America [MN] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] the pollution. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Probably the pollution, I don't know. [NOISE] I like [MN] -- I like living here.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But being that I've never -- the only other country I've been to is Canada so I couldn't really --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't have anything to compare to. [MN] So, I don't know. [NOISE]
R:  Well, I guess the traffic jams but I mean, I think they have that all over the world now, uh --
L:  Yeah, I think so.
R:  -- now, too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They're, uh --
L:  I think so.
R:  And then you could do other things, you could [MN] -- with a million dollars you could probably spend a lot of good time [LAUGH] travelling all over the world.
L:  Oh, definitely, yeah.  With a million dollars I think, uh, I would have a nice time. [NOISE] I would have a good time out there. [NOISE] Buy a house or something. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or there's that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there's the, um, uh, the Renaissance Cruise Ship that has the condos on it that you [LAUGH] can buy like a condo but it's on a cruise ship.  So, you buy a cabin --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on a cruise ship.
L:  [NOISE] Are you serious?  I've never heard of that.
R:  No, it's -- but it's very, uh [MN] -- it's not only expensive for the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- cabin, th- the upkeep is very, uh, very --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- expensive.  But they go all over the -- all over the world.
L:  Wow, okay. [NOISE]
R:  [MN]
L:  [LIPSMACK] Okay.
R:  Are there any other countries that you would consider?
L:  [MN] Um, let me see. [MN] [LIPSMACK] 
R:  I can't figure --
L:  Um --
R:  -- out why you would pick France if you've never been there.
L:  [MN]
R:  Can you speak French?
L:  No. [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  My dad can, but not me. [MN] I picked France because, like I said, I would pursue my modeling career.  I don't know any other country where you could probably do that.
R:  Oh, Italy's big for, uh, models. [MN]
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  But I think --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- France and Italy are probably about the --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- two -- two biggest ones.
L:  Mhm. [MN] What any other country?  I don't think, I mean --
R:  [MN] Well, there's the country --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  --where all the uh, the models --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- come from.  You know where that is?
L:  Um --
R:  Slovakia.
L:  [NOISE] Are you serious?
R:  Yeah, there's a city there, +Bratislava I think, that, uh, has more [MN] supermodels per -- [MN] more big time --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- models per thousand than any c- --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- any place in the world.
L:  [MN] Wow, I didn't --
R:  But, uh --
L:  -- know that.
R:  -- but that's a different [MN] place.  Um --
L:  Yeah, I don't think I'd want to go there.  I don't know, I'm not -- I don't know, I'm not really familiar with, like --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I can't think of anywhere else that I'd wanna be.  I'm too scared to be in the Middle East.
R:  [MN]
L:  [MN] I wouldn't want to be in, like, Germany or anything like --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- that. [MN]
R:  But it would be tough never being able to come back again.  That would be the hard part because -- I guess you could have your family go over and visit, uh, visit you.
L:  Right.
R:  With the million dollars you could buy a lot of, uh, a lot of tickets.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [MN] Oh.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Is there anywhere else you wouldn't think you would go for a million dollars?
R:  I might consider some place in, like, Argentina or some place --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in South America.  I can speak a little Spanish but not, uh --
L:  [MN] Well, yeah.  I didn't think about that.  Maybe Brazil? [NOISE]
R:  Oh, another -- you know where another great place is, uh, Bermuda.
L:  Really?  Have you been there?
R:  [MN] Uh, yes.  I've been there a couple of times. [MN]
L:  Really?
R:  And I guess that would keep me [MN], I could be a management consultant in Bermuda just as easily as, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- as here.  'Specially with a lot of stuff over the computer now, you don't really even have to be there a lot of time.
L:  Right. [MN] [NOISE] Right.  Okay. [NOISE] Yeah, I was thinking about it, like Spain or somewhere like that.  I would probably go to a Spanish country. [NOISE]
R:  Spain is very nice, I've been there.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  The Costa del, uh -- Costa del Sol's just like, uh, Flor-, uh, Florida or -- or, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- California.  You know, that nice [MN] ocean and -- and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, beaches --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and all of that. [MN] It's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a real resort area.  Good weather most of the year. [MN] [PAUSE] Hello?  Hello? [LAUGH] Hello? [PAUSE] [MN] Hello? [MN] [PAUSE] [MN] Hello? [MN] [NOISE] Hello? [PAUSE] [MN] Hello? [MN] [PAUSE] [MN] [NOISE] [PAUSE]
