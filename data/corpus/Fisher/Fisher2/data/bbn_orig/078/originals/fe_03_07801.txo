L:  Uh --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- Don.
R:  Hi, I'm Marcy.
L:  Hi.
R:  Um, we're supposed to ...  What is this one?  How we draw the line?
L:  Uh, with comedy.  Yeah.
R:  With comedy.  [MN]  I'm -- I'm not a shy person so I basically just, uh, speak [LAUGH] up.
L:  Oh, you just speak up?
R:  Yeah, I'm pretty -- I'm pretty good about that.  I'll just say, you know, [MN] at wor- work or whatever, you know.  Shouldn't, you know -- please don't do that.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
R:  I don't appreciate it.  I ...
L:  Yeah, I kind a, uh, fit the same tone.  You know, some place you can certainly push the envelope but some place it's certainly inappropriate as you said.
R:  Or, uh, like, um, if it doesn't stop sometimes I think because I -- I -- I worked actually worked.  I haven't -- I'm not working right now but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- where I, um, you know, if I like anonymously, maybe, like, somehow tell the boss or, you know, just -- but I don't -- I never want it really addressed.  I don't -- I don't think it's this huge issue.  I don't really have that big of a problem with what [LAUGH] we're talking about.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  But, um, you know, I'll just [MN] ask them maybe to address it as a group.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or, um, maybe -- but, like, I'm trying to think of other situations other than work 'cause I guess it is all the time.
L:  Oh, yeah.  It can certainly, uh, be all the time sometimes or ...  You know --
R:  Um ...
L:  -- within family or, uh, or friends --
R:  I mean, even, well --
L:  -- sometimes it can ... 
R:  Families usually, I think my family's usually the same but like at a party I mean I guess I would just, like, remove myself from [LAUGH] that -- from that group if I was uncomfortable.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I guess that it's kind of funny thing to talk about 'cause I'm -- I don't have that big [LAUGH] of a problem with it.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Same here.  Yeah.
R:  But I guess like you know -- you know walk away if you're at somewhere there's a lot of people, I'm sure there's, like, other people.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know you could chat with or whatever.  
L:  Uh, yeah.  [MN]
R:  Um, the only thing I don't like, like funny humor stuff, I don't like it in my email.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, in email?  Uh-huh.
R:  Depends.  It depends only because, you know, [MN] I have children.  It -- kind of in the same email as I [LAUGH] am.  
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You don't want them, uh ...
R:  So, um, I don't like that.  Trying to think what else?  Draw the line between what was it exactly?  Draw the line between ...?
L:  Uh ...
R:  Humour and, what'd they say?
L:  Uh, yeah, drawing the line, you know, with comedy.  You know.
R:  Um.
L:  Yeah.  I guess --
R:  You know I don't really [MN] ...
L:  Yeah, I mean, I have pretty much heard just about everything so it's not like, "Oh [several inaudible words]"
R:  What did you say?
L:  I've pretty much heard, uh, [MN] a wide --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- variety of things.  There ain't a whole lot that can shock me, you know.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I, yeah, I mean, I -- like I said, it's hard -- it's hard topic because you have to be a person that really, I don't know, gets offended.  I've -- I've been on the other [LAUGH] side where I've been the person possibly, you know, offending somebody else and a lot of times what I do is, um, I'll ask if I know that I'm gonna tell a joke or, um, y- you know I'll say, you know, I'm -- I'm gonna tell this.  You now, you gonna be offended otherwise I'll just tell so and so by themselves if you don't want to hear.  You know.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  You don't want to hear it or it's gonna make you uncomfortable, because I've kind of been in that situation.  
L:  Well, I think that --
R:  Before.
L:  That's pretty good that you, you know ...
R:  You know, and just give the person I [MN] -- I -- I try 'cause, you know, [MN] when you're around ...  I -- I know all kinds of people.  I know people that definitely don't want to hear it.  
L:  Oh, yeah, you certainly have those people.  That's pretty good you're, uh, kind a --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- spit it out front.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I kind of usually, well, uh -- just kind of talk to people and gauge and get an idea.
R:  I -- I know it's like for -- for [LAUGH] me it's hard 'cause for me there's like not really -- I'm very open person so there's really not -- I guess I have to be considerate of other people with this topic.  
L:  Yeah.  Have you ever been on the other end where you were, like, offended by something?
R:  Where I've offended somebody?
L:  No.  Wh- where like you were -- you were offended by something someone had said?
R:  Um, [SIGH] very rarely.  I mean, I really can't remember -- like I said I'm pretty -- pretty open.  The only thing I -- I don't like about, um, like things that are -- [MN] maybe distasteful if they're at -- specifically at somebody.
L:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
R:  With a particular person or, um, [LIPSMACK] [MN] maybe like a religious type of things.  I don't -- I don't like when jokes go there.  When --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- humor goes to -- to [MN] -- like if it's a general funny kind of a thing but when it starts to get like personal.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, like --
R:  Then I don't like it.
L:  -- certain ethnic things or some- --
R:  Because you never know who's sitting in a room who's --
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  -- with religion or, um, you know, maybe their background.  People don't necessarily always look like from where they may be from.  So when they start picking on, you know, race or [MN] you know, nationality.  I -- I don't like -- I get a little uncomfortable with those because you just never -- you never know and sometimes people just act like it's okay in a group and then somewhere you've really hurt somebody.  
L:  Yeah, that's true.  Sometime --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you can, uh ...
R:  And I don't like to do that.  So I kind of [MN] stay away from certain topics because I -- I don't think they're [LAUGH] funny.  
L:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  Like I have, um, I don't know.  I'm trying to think.  What else?  Other ways.  Um, but things that I don't like in my email.  I don't mind a lot of the funny stuff that comes through but like there's a lot of sexual humor.  
L:  Oh, yeah, where you [MN] ...
R:  On there and it may be funny but like it's not funny if my eight year old, like, walks over.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah.  [several inaudible words]. 
R:  And opens it up so I wish maybe somebody could, like, give me a warning [LAUGH] first or ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Before they do it.  [LIPSMACK]  Um, I don't know.  Don't know what else other [MN] way.  Um, God they give us hard topics.  
L:  Yeah, it is.  Yeah, it is kind a hard one.
R:  I -- I guess it might not be so -- like I said it might not be so hard if you, like -- you have, like, this issue but I'm trying -- I have to, like, think really [LAUGH] hard.  Um, what else?
L:  Uh ...  [MN]
R:  Did it ever happen?  Have you ever been in that situation?
L:  Oh, yeah.  I've been on both.  Um ...
R:  On which side?
L:  Both -- both sides where I've kind -- kind of --
R:  On both sides.
L:  -- uh, offended someone.  I mean, I was in the military before.
R:  What -- what did you do?
L:  Um, when I was in the military and, uh, [inaudible] -- when I was in the military and did it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, when I was in the military and did that kind of, like, uh, you know, I'd apologize to the, uh, you know, the person.  I -- I -- I kind of didn't realise, you know, what I kind a said.  
R:  Well, that's -- that's the whole --
L:  You know, but ...
R:  -- thing.  Sometimes --
L:  And then after it I said, "Oh, you know, I -- you know, I'm certainly sorry, you know.  I didn't -- I didn't mean to, you know, offend you in anyway".  And then I've been the other end, you know [MN] you know, with, uh, ethnic jokes and stuff like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, some of me will [inaudible] kind of laugh at yourself.  I go, "Oh, yeah, you know".  Then other things just kind of take it too far.
R:  Yeah, I mean.  I -- I get -- I'm Jewish and I get ...
L:  Oh, yeah.  So, yeah, that's ...
R:  It's been, you know, people ...  You know what, and sometimes it's generally funny and just some- sometimes it's really -- really just not.  So some- -- I just would prefer that people just don't go there.  I'm -- I'm like not one for saying like [MN] I don't know.  Like I just don't even think any of those things matter.  
L:  Mm.
R:  And then people -- I don't know.  That's -- that's like a pretty touchy topic with me, I guess.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah, well I can imagine 'cause, uh ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I certainly have, uh, my share of Jewish friends and, uh, sometimes it seems like, you know, almost every other day someone [several inaudible words].
R:  Just trying to --
L:  -- joke or, you know.  [several inaudible words].  
R:  Well ...
L:  [MN], you know, that's not so funny.  You know sometimes --
R:  No, it --
L:  -- if someone spits out something to me and I say, " [MN]  You know that's -- that's not really too funny.  You might need to --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- yeah, kind of watch what you're saying 'cause you're gonna offend somebody".
R:  Like I said, jokes are jokes but when they start to get, um -- that's why I -- I mean, uh, even at work I've just said, you know, let's like change the topic.  Let's -- I don't -- I don't care if we joke about, you know, jokes.  Like just things that are just no- normally funny but when they start to hit those, you know, religion, [MN] race, um ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, anything spiritual.  Things like that.  'Cause I mean, I -- I worked with people before that, you know, were into things that I probably would never ever be into.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But to them it's not [LAUGH] funny.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  'Cause that's truly what they believe.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well ...  Um ...  Wow, why don't they give us +something easy?  Draw the line between, um -- just trying to think.  Have any other [LAUGH] idea?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN]
L:  Yeah, I'm trying to think.  I mean, this is ...
R:  Ten minutes of conversation on this [LAUGH] ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  It gets hard.  Nobody would ever believe.  
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um ...
L:  It is kind a hard what -- you know, it sounds like you're pretty much, uh, straightforward. 
R:  Like what?
L:  Sounds like you're pretty much straightforward about it.
R:  I think that's really the only way to be because I'd rather --
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  I'd rather give a person, especially somebody that I like.  You know, everybody's different and, uh, just because they maybe would think something was funny doesn't mean I'm not gonna like them anymore, but I would like to give them the opportunity to know around me this bothers me.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I -- I still, you know, still want to be your friend or still want to, you know, get along with you at work or whatever -- whatever the deal is.  But just know that when you're around me this isn't funny rather than, you know, get into confrontation with them.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  At some other time.  So ...  But I'm pretty straightforward about a [LAUGH] lot of things.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Shy is not my -- my problem.
L:  Oh, well, that's a --
R:  So ...
L:  -- a good thing in a lot of way.
R:  Well, sometimes.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Sometimes
