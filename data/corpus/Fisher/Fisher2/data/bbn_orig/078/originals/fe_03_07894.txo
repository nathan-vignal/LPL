R:  Sandy Randolph.
L:  Hey, I'm Kelly Cellicut.
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  I'm fine, how are you?
R:  [SIGH] Well, what would you do in the situation?
L:  If I could have a million dollars if I never talked to my best friend again?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I would be very tempted [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Me too, 'cause seeing as how I haven't talked to my best friend in, ah, four years.  [LAUGH].
L:  Okay, well, I think that that would work for me.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I don't think I --
L:  A million dollars is a lot of money.
R:  It is a lot of money.
L:  And --
R:  You can make other friends.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  With a million dollars you can buy other friends.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You'd buy a lot of friends.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I don't think it'd be a big deal.  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH] Well, I mean, I love my best friend, and I would miss her, but, I -- but, [inaudible] would be too busy with a million dollars, to --
R:  Oh, but, see, listen, it just said talk to them -- it didn't say you could write.
L:  Right, I mean --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it doesn't mean you'd have to completely do away with them.
R:  Yeah, you just couldn't --
L:  So --
R:  -- talk to 'em, you could write letters, and send email, and ... [LAUGH] 
L:  That's right, email would work.
R:  See?
L:  I- instant messages, even.
R:  There's loopholes in everything.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's right, and I think we found it, 'cause they didn't specify.
R:  No, they didn't specify, see, my husband helped me a long time ago -- you have to look for loopholes in everything.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [SIGH] So, I think that would work.
L:  I think that would work too.
R:  [inaudible] I'm not talking to her again for a million dollars.
L:  Yeah [MN].
R:  It'd be well worth it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I mean, a million dollars is a million dollars --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- no matter how you look at it.
R:  Yeah, and how many times are you gonna get the opportunity to be -- have it given to you?
L:  Right.
R:  So -- besides, I think my best friend would probably quit talking to me too, if she had a million dollars.
L:  Yeah, I think most people --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- if they were given the option, you know, "Hey, you can talk to Kelly, or, you can have a million dollars" --
R:  [LAUGH] Exactly.
L:  -- it's like, ah, "Are you gonna be giving that to me in cash, or cheque?"
R:  Yeah, yeah, exactly -- "I'll take that in cash".  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  "I can go to the bank right now."
L:  So, I think that probably most people would say, "Oh well, yeah, okay".
R:  Yeah, I think they would too.
L:  I can do without my best friend -- talking to her.
R:  [MN] There's that movie Indecent Proposal where he --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- offers a million dollars to spend one night with his wife --
L:  Right.
R:  -- he --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- he took it, you know?
L:  Yeah, but, see we wouldn't even have to get naked --
R:  Well, no.
L:  -- so, all we would have to do is not talk to our best friend.
R:  Yeah, and we'd still email 'em, because he said talk.
L:  Right.
R:  And, I'll talk to a lot of people -- I don't need to talk to her.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  And, it's like you said, I can make new friends.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  With a million dollars, I mean, I would need a --
R:  All those cruises I'm gonna be going on -- I'm sure.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right, I would need a new set of friends anyway --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to keep up with me.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Because, our interests would change.
R:  Yep, exac- -- well, I mean, [inaudible] funny -- you have money, your interests change.
L:  Uh-huh --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's hilarious.
R:  It is.  [SIGH]
L:  Well, I mean, you just do more, and --
R:  Yeah, you haven't -- yeah.
L:  -- and then the people that you were friends with, they really can't hang with you, because they don't have the money.
R:  Or, they get jealous, because you do have the money now.
L:  Right, so --
R:  So ...
L:  -- yeah, I think if I had a million dollars I would have a different set of friends, and --
R:  Yeah, I believe I would too.
L:  -- and, you know, we would be jet setting, and -- and doing our thing, and [SIGH] -- well, my best friend just really wouldn't be into that kind of thing.
R:  No?
L:  So ...
R:  Mine probably wouldn't either.  Well, there's a man up the road from us, that just -- just lives, like, three miles up the road from us, and he has a whole truckload of money, you can say, and -- he actually offered someone a free trip to Florida for three weeks --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- no expenses at all, he would pay it for him, but, the guy couldn't stand him and wouldn't go -- I'm like, I'd go.  [LAUGH]
L:  Wow, I could stand anybody for free.
R:  Exactly.  [LAUGH]
L:  [several inaudible words] 
R:  I could do that for free.  [LAUGH] 
L:  What do these people want?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, [inaudible] ...
R:  I guess, ah, that'd be okay with me.
L:  This is my first phone call on the little thing -- have you --
R:  Oh, I've had a couple, ah, this is -- this the first one I've been able to accept, 'cause I haven't been here for the other ones.
L:  Yeah, me too, so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I really didn't know what to expect -- they said something in the introduction about a -- the topic was an anonymous benefactor, and I was sitting there thinking, "Oh, please, let me have one".
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, "Where -- what's his name?".  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, can -- can he --
R:  "Bill Gates?"  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, "Is Bill Gates really my dad?".  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "Please, tell me he is."
R:  [LAUGH] As long as it's not Martha Stewart, I'm okay.
L:  Well, [several inaudible words] her money -- right at this point -- I'd [several inaudible words] --
R:  Well, she really ain't gonna have much more after that though.  
L:  Ah, I'd send her some cookies in jail --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- "Hey Mom, here's you some cookies -- send me some money".
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  You know, "Do you need someplace to hide all that money that you made?".
R:  [LAUGH] "I've got a place in my bank account, right for it."  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, "And nobody would ever suspect me".  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "I promise, and I'd save you a little bit for when you get out".
R:  Yeah, a little bit -- fifty cents.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah, she --
R:  [LAUGH] Hail a cab.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, those people that make money like that though, they have a tendency to -- she'll go to prison and then she'll write a book about it.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And, she'll make a fortune on the book, 'cause everybody'll buy it.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Like, she's the only person that's ever been to prison.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  [inaudible] this is funny.
R:  [inaudible] crazy [inaudible].
L:  [several inaudible words] -- I'm still curious about this study that they're doing, I mean, what are they are gonna do -- see how far off topic me and you can get?  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Well, we've stayed on the topic of money, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, money being the central core of it.
R:  So, I think we're doing okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, it -- it does seem like a -- [MN] a better thing to do, I don't know.
L:  Where -- where are you from?
R:  I'm from Tennessee.
L:  Ah, I noticed the definite southern accent there.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm in North Carolina, so ...
R:  Oh, so, you're not that far from the south.  [LAUGH]
L:  No, I'm right there with ya --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I'm actually just east of you.
R:  Yeah?
L:  So ...
R:  My husband goes to North Carolina [MN] about every month or so.
L:  Really?  [inaudible] --
R:  Yeah, his cousin drives a race car, so, he goes over there to pick up the race cars.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, everybody when they think about North Carolina, they immediately think racing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  Well, theirs is in dirt track, or, theirs is in Nascar's dirt track.
L:  Yeah. [MN] 
R:  But, it's just as invigorating I guess.
L:  Yeah, how's your weather there today?
R:  Actually, today it's pretty hot.
L:  Oh [MN], I'm outside -- I'm painting my mailbox.
R:  Oh.
L:  And, I thought I would wait until closer in the evening, and so, that's what I had done, you know, 'cause it's going on five o'clock here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, I'm out here, just sweating like crazy.
R:  I know, it's nuts.  I gotta go mow here in a few minutes.
L:  Oh.
R:  [MN]
L:  Better you, than me.  I mowed [inaudible] --
R:  I'm just gonna mow a little bit. 
L:  -- I mowed it the first of the week, so ...
R:  [MN]
L:  I'm cool with that, for a couple more days.
R:  It's been raining, so, we haven't been able to.
L:  Yeah, we've had -- we were in a drought and now we're in flood.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So [NOISE] -- hi baby.
R:  Oh, no.
L:  Yeah, my kids -- they --
R:  Yeah, I have two.
L:  I -- I have two, too -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- two girls.
R:  I have a boy and a girl.
L:  I have two little girls -- six and four.
R:  Oh, mine's eight and four.  [LAUGH]
L:  But, they're not liking the hot weather, 'cause they don't think that they can go out, 'cause, you know, they might melt.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  Have to have the air conditioner on.
L:  Yeah, they have to be in here with the air, and right up under me, "Mom, I'm bored --"
R:  No.
L:  "-- can we do something?".
R:  "Take me to the library -- I wanna go swimming".
L:  [inaudible]
R:  "Let's go get some ice cream".
L:  It's just too hot right now, to do anything -- maybe when the sun goes down.
R:  Yeah, yeah, maybe.
L:  It cools off a little bit -- 
R:  I know it.
L:  -- that would be nice.
R:  I know it.
L:  [MN] I don't know -- [inaudible] --
R:  You see, and if we had that million dollars we wouldn't have to worry about leaving the house -- we could have them coming to us.
L:  Or, we could have the nanny take the children out.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, "You take 'em for the day -- we don't want 'em".
L:  So, see, my best friend would be history.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It's like -- best friend, million dollars -- hm ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, I [MN] -- have another best friend in about a week, but, this million dollars is gonna last me -- well, it probably wouldn't last as long as you think it would.
R:  If it was free and clear of tax, you know, nothing.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It lasts longer than what you think though.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, in this day and age -- shoot.  It cost a million dollars to go to college for a semester, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, just about.
R:  [LAUGH] I mean --
L:  Depending on where the kids go.
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  So, I don't know.
R:  So, it wouldn't last very long, but, I don't know.
L:  Well, you'd have to be really smart with it.
R:  You'd have to be, I mean, you could invest it, you know.
L:  We could call Martha Stewart and ask her for some tips.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, we could.
L:  See, we're staying on topic, we're back on Martha.
R:  [LAUGH] We could -- we could put it -- we could invest it, and put it in different accounts.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, see?
L:  Hide it from our spouses.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah -- oh, yeah.
L:  Money?  Who got money?  Not me, uh-uh.
R:  What?  The bank account didn't get bigger -- well, you must be crazy -- it's somebody elses.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Wowie.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  Could you imagine doing that?  Some people would do that all the time -- they hide money from their spouses.  Like that woman who won the lottery a couple of years ago.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, she hid it from her husband.  I thought there's no way -- my husband would definitely notice the Beamer in the front yard.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well, my ex -- soon to be ex, would too.
R:  [LAUGH] See?
L:  So, he [MN] [NOISE] -- I tell ya, there's a reason they call 'em exes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, but, we were married -- we were together for sixteen years.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  And, I'm only thirty four, so --
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  -- it's one of those things that happens when you get together with your high school sweetheart.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, and --
R:  Well, I got married straight out of high school -- I was eighteen, so ... I'm twenty four now.
L:  Oh, you're still just a baby.
R:  Yeah, I hear that all the time.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, you are, I'm thirty four.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I remember twenty four quite fondly.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It was many, many moons ago.
R:  Fifteen years.
L:  Yeah, but, fifteen years, that's a long time.
R:  Ten years, and two kids, huh?
L:  Yeah, ten years and two kids -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- my kids aren't even ten yet.
R:  No.
L:  So.
R:  Well, mine's eight and four -- I started early with them, too.
L:  Well, that's good though --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, because, you know -- just don't decide to have anymore.
R:  Oh, no.
L:  It gets harder the older you get -- I had my first one at twenty eight, and my second one at twenty nine ... so ...
R:  So, you had them back to back --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- [inaudible].  [MN]
L:  [inaudible] said, "What were you thinking?", and I said, "Obviously I wasn't". 
R:  [several inaudible words] [LAUGH]
L:  So [COUGH] ...
R:  Couldn't do it -- couldn't do it -- well, you can't afford to have more than two kids anymore.
L:  No, not really.
R:  I mean, it's just crazy.
L:  Unless you get a million dollars for dropping your best friend.
R:  Yeah, I mean -- sure, I wanna have four more kids -- I'll drop 'em.
