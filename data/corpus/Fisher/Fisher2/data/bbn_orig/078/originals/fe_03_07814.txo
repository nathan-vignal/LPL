L:  [MN]
R:  Hi, this is Lisa.
L:  Uh, hi, this is Corey.
R:  Hi, Corey.  How are you?
L:  I'm all right.  How are you?
R:  I'm doing great.  Well, the topic is perjury.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- have you done one of these, uh, conversations before?
L:  No, this is my first one.
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, we have ten minutes to discuss it, I guess.  
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, I don't know.  What are your thoughts on perjury as far as, uh, if it was a close family member or a friend?
L:  Well, I don't know.  It's kind of a spontaneous --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- question but I guess how these things -- I guess that's how these things work.  Um, gosh, I don't know.  I've never been called to the stand before but, um, I don't know.  I think it all depends on the situation and what's, uh, what's involved and what's at risk.  What the crime is and who I'm lying for.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  
L:  Um, I don't know.  It just all depends on the situation, I think.  Now if it's, uh, we're talking about murder or [LAUGH] you know some serious crime --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- who I'm lying for, uh, just depends on who I would be lying on.  I don't know.  Just, you know, I think, um, if there's a good chance of me being caught or, uh, you know, whatever.  It just depends, I guess.  I don't know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I haven't really been put in that situation before.
R:  I guess it would depend on if the person asked you to do that or if you're --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- volunteering to do it on your own and, uh, whether or not there would be repercussions afterwards.  It's a survey, Jeffrey.  
L:  [MN]
R:  So I guess, you know, you just -- you have to look at each situation and decide, um, you know, what the consequences are and, you know, I guess take each situation as it comes.  And on its own merit.
L:  Now if somebody asked me to do this I don't think I would because that right there would signify, I don't know ...  That right there would just be like, um, oh, let's say, I don't know.  It's kind a like -- that's just kind a setting yourself up, I would think.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause, you know, it's like how many other people have they asked to do this?
R:  Yeah. 
L:  I think, you know, like you said, it's, uh, just depending on, um, [MN] [LAUGH] you know, um, just -- just who I was doing this for or, you know, like what -- what the consequences would be and -- you know, what's all at stake.
R:  Right.
L:  It's kind of a broad question.  
R:  I think so.  I know one time I was on a murder trial and it lasted five months and one of the star witnesses that took the stand she lied to the jury and to the judge and to the attorneys, and the judge was not [LAUGH] very happy with her.  And, uh, you know, like he really came down hard on her.
L:  Wow.
R:  And, uh, so I saw first hand something like that going on and course I was thinking, you know, why would she do this?  But, you know, maybe she didn't care or, you know, I don't know what the reason was but, uh ...  It was interesting to see, you know, how it, uh, or what the consequences were as far as being in a court room.  
L:  Well, I imagine, like you said, the judge wasn't very happy.  
R:  No.
L:  Um, it, uh -- of course, it seems like the judge is never happy when you're in the courtroom.  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's right.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I think a lot of times they feel that maybe some of these things can be resolved without going to court but, you know, situations can get out of hand and -- so then that's why they wind up in front of the judge.
L:  Um, yeah, like you said, the, um --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- murder trial.  I don't know.  It just seemed like to me that would be the epitome of, I guess, lying because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, I don't know.  You're talking about two people's lives there, you know.  It's like the person that did it, obviously, if they are found guilty is -- well, I don't know.  You can't really [SIGH] depending on the justice system nowadays they could get out in five years.  They could get out in twenty years, all depends on the state, I guess.
R:  That's true.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And in the case of the trial I was on it was based on circumstantial evidence so ...
L:  Oh.
R:  You know, there weren't really any witnesses.
L:  I was watching --
R:  And so --
L:  Oh, I'm sorry.  Go ahead.
R:  It was -- it was just really difficult to come to the decision that we did and I think afterwards, you know, we were afraid of, uh, ramifications from this murderer's friends just because --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- they had been in the courtroom watching this and, of course, probably taking notes.  They knew what towns we lived in.  And they knew what our names were.  And ...
L:  Oh, definitely.  Depends on the people you're dealing with.  I mean, uh ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  If it's the mob or [LAUGH] some random thug off the street, uh, I don't know.  Like you said there's a lot of ramifications we're talking about here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I don't know.  Like I said I haven't really done this from personal experience so I guess, um, you would know a lot more about it than I would but, uh, I don't know, I just really couldn't say until I got put into that situation.
R:  Yeah.  Do you ever think about [COUGH] being in that [COUGH] 'scuse me -- being in that situation and what you would do?
L:  Well, like I said, um --
R:  Like I say, if you watch a TV show and they're dealing with perjury and you think, well, you know, I could identify with that person or, you know, I might do that --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- if I was in that situation or ...
L:  Well, I was watching this thing on, uh, TV the other night about this, um, foster parent that, um, was going on trial for killing one of his foster kids, supposedly.
R:  Oh, my.  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, they were going to use --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- the -- well, now the -- the kid is four years old, his little brother as a witness.  It's like how credible is a four year old, you know?
R:  That's true.
L:  Um, I think in that ci- circumstance if I was, um, say, you know, some relation to the foster parent I think, you know, going up against a four year old, I think committing perjury in that, um, in that -- in -- in that, um, situation would be a whole lot easier than going up against, say, you know, s- -- uh, you know, a- another adult who -- who can -- can think about, uh -- who, you know, has a rational thought process.
R:  Right.  Or someone, you know, who's well known in the community and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, is a very likeable individual and has a lot of friends and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, that -- that could, uh, be a determining factor.
L:  Well, like you said, about, um, your -- your experience in that, um, gosh, there -- there's a lot of, uh, things that could happen.  Ramifications, like, uh, you know, if -- if you don't do this to a certain person, uh, you know, they know where you live.  They know where --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you work.  They know your family.  They know your friends.  
R:  That's right.
L:  No telling what could happen.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  But it's like, uh, I guess you gotta do -- when it comes down to it, I guess you have to do the right thing and -- and whatever your morals are or whatever, you know, your thoughts are on things, I guess that's what you're ultimately gonna do.
R:  Yeah.  And just, uh, you know, hope that -- say if it is a court process that, you know, they see it as you doing the right thing.
L:  Mhm.  Well, course the justice system nowadays is just kind a [SIGH] weighted towards [SIGH] I guess whoever can have the best lawyer and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH]  Uh, whoever can, you know, I guess, uh, talk their way -- talk their way out of things.  Uh ...
R:  Yeah, it seems that way from the TV shows that we watch, like The Practice and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- those other, uh, attorney type shows that ...  You know, it's all a strategy game and it's --
L:  Oh, exactly.
R:  [MN]  You know, it's all this wheeling and dealing out --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of the courtroom and ...
L:  I think a lot of the things that go on outside of the courtroom [MN] are -- [MN] uh, determine a lot of, uh, what goes on inside.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Especially, uh, with the attorneys, I guess.  If you got a public defender, of course they're not gonna work as hard for you as would, say, somebody who hired a high powered attorney.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.  It's all about who has the money.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  The bottom line.  [LAUGH]  The dollars speak.  [LAUGH] 
L:  But, uh, gosh, I don't know if -- jee- jeeze, I mean, that's a really hard question to answer.  Would you commit perjury?  It's like, uh, just all depends on the situation.
R:  Yeah.  I think for myself I'm probably too honest a person.  I couldn't lie and get [LAUGH] away with it.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, I'd -- I'd get caught and so it's -- for me it's just easier to tell the truth and, you know, face whatever the consequences are and go on.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, if you're a -- if you're not an honest person it's [MN] just [MN] karma, you know.  Everything will --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- catch up to you in the end somehow or another.  
R:  That's right.  
L:  [SIGH]  But, uh, I -- you know, I would knowing me it was -- it -- it would just eat at me until I could just tell somebody, you know.  I -- I think it would eventually get out if I did.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  So I guess, uh, I -- I don-
