L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  Hi, my name's Sue, how are you?
L:  Huh, fine, my name's Harris, how are you?
R:  Good.  Where are you at, Harris?
L:  Uh, I'm in Boston.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm south of Pittsburgh.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, uh, yeah, this is, uh -- I like this, uh -- this thing, it's, [NOISE] uh -- this is a pretty [NOISE] good project to get.
R:  It's interesting, different. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, what do you think about the topic of the day?
L:  Well, I think it's, uh -- yeah, it's -- it's a little different than, uh -- I did one of these before, it's a little different, um -- but, um -- yeah, I don't know, I -- I'm not sure a million is quite enough, but, you know, the question is is it before tax or after tax?
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, everything's before tax --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know.
L:  [LAUGH] Right, exactly.  I mean, you know, if you have, uh -- have a million dollars you can buy yourself some new friends, so ... [NOISE]
R:  Wow, I don't know, I don't think I'd want the kind of friends you could buy with a million dollars.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  No, I wouldn't take the money, it would have to be substantially more than a million to give up your friends.
L:  Yeah.  Actually the whole thing sounds sort of like a, um -- sort of a bad reality show.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's true, there's enough --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- of those on now --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there's enough of them on. [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  But, uh -- yeah, it's kind of like being a betrayer, you know, you're selling out again for bucks and I don't know, I just never thought of myself as that kind of person.  I guess everybody has a price for something but --
L:  It's hard to say, I mean --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- probably a million dollars isn't enough [NOISE] but, you know, maybe -- I mean, would -- how much would be enough, you know?
R:  Well, that's what I'm --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- saying --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH] Ten million, twenty?
R:  I don't know, and of course after a few million what's a couple of million between friends? [LAUGH]
L:  Right, exactly.  I mean, there's a certain amount of money that, uh -- you know, because, uh -- I mean, let's face it -- cynically, uh, you know -- you're going to at some, uh -- like I was reading something the other day, it's, like, you know, basically over time, sort of, you know, a certain amount of your friends drop off anyway.
R:  Right, right.
L:  You know, either you get into an argument with them or you just move apart or whatever, I mean --
R:  Right, your lives diverge --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- your circumstances -- yeah.
L:  'Cause that's -- like, I think, yeah, you know, in terms of, like, the number of, uh, [NOISE] people I talk to from college, you know -- it's, like, I went to a -- I graduated from college about twenty years ago --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and [NOISE] I would say, just in terms of, you know, how many I talk to now as opposed to say, ten years ago, it's probably at least half, you know.
R:  Oh, definitely.  Or, you're down to those few Christmas cards kind of thing. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  Yeah, yeah --
L:  But --
R:  -- every year.  Well, one of you suddenly doesn't send and then you -- the next year the other person thinks, "Oh, never mind" and yeah, we were just --
L:  I never liked them anyway. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, maybe they didn't like them and just, "Well, I'm probably never really going to see them again" and our lives don't have that much to say to each other any more because we don't really know everything --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- about each other so -- definitely.  Well, that's true, I guess I sort of, uh, define, under friends, close family people too and I -- and I definitely wouldn't want to sacrifice them so ...
L:  Yeah, but I don't think that that's really -- you know, I think it's more like, uh --
R:  Friendship.
L:  Yeah, uh, I don't know.  Uh, I'm not going to -- I'm not going to nitpick, but I think --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I think that that's -- that's actually -- it's probably -- uh, it, you know -- if -- if it was a little more money it would probably be, uh -- it would probably be on the table.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, that's true.  Uh, you know, what was it -- there was a movie out one time where somebody sold their wife -- [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  -- to somebody, you know --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- because it was the same thing, if the price is right, you know.  But, uh, I just know that certain things -- I know we've been through a few deaths in the family lately and, uh, you know, my friends were definitely there for me and they were people that I could count on.  And, you know, I could turn to them when I need anything and so I would really hate to think that --
L:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- I would lose --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that, and that's something that's almost -- you can't put a value on, so ...
L:  Yeah.  Well, you could, uh -- you could send them a check anonymously.
R:  That's -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But, then the next time I needed them in a desperate situation they'd be gone. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, you know, it just -- it depends, I guess, but [LIPSMACK] you're right.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I don't know, I mean, it's -- it's like it just -- it seems like the -- see, I think the answer today would be a lot different than it might have been, I don't know, thirty or forty years ago because --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's -- we live in a much more kind of transient society and --
R:  Oh, right, right.
L:  -- you know, you move, uh -- you move around more and your life changes a lot more.  I mean, people used to live in the same place for decades --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and so, you know, I think it would have been inconceivable to, uh -- to do that, uh, you know, because, you know, what could you do, 'cause you lived in the same place or whatever, but now, you know, you -- you move from one city to another, I mean --
R:  Right.
L:  -- like I said, I think a certain number of people just drop out of the loop.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- marketing, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- who you saw every day and [NOISE] --
R:  Some people are a little more adaptable, you may not make close friends but you do make friends based on whether they're working out at the same health club you are or whether they're, you know, eating lunch --
L:  Right.
R:  -- at the same place you are all the time or whatever and you do pick up people, um, so ...
L:  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, it's -- you're right, I mean, a lot of it's just the situational more than anything else and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and that --
R:  And there are so many people that, because they're so transient, are needy for friends that it's usually relatively easy to find new friends.
L:  Right, exactly.  Not because people are, uh -- [NOISE] they're all -- uh, everyone's in the same boat.
R:  Same boat, yes [LAUGH] definitely.
L:  Yeah, I think -- I think it cou- it could make a good reality show 'cause what you could do is, you could have someone like, you know -- you could vote your friends off --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [LAUGH] one by one. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, exactly.  It would be, like, "Okay, [LAUGH] for a hundred thou- --"
R:  Time's up.
L:  "-- a hundred thousand dollars I'm getting rid of Bob". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] "How am I going to get rid of the next hundred?"
L:  Exactly, you know, and then -- and then at some point you reach -- you know, you'd reach a level where -- where, uh, you know, it'd be, like, "Okay, well I can't get rid of this person ...".  But, you know, goo- -- I think that that should be a good show because the, you know, it'd be like the f- -- you know, think how rejected and awful, you know, the people would feel who --
R:  The first one --
L:  [LAUGH] And so they'd sit there and they'd -- you know, they'd do the close up on the person crying and, you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- "I can't believe that". [LAUGH]
R:  Well, of course it would be interesting to inject the variable of, uh, males versus females too.  Do females care more about their friendships and their people or are males -- easier to sacrifice the, uh, relationship bond there?
L:  Right.  Oh, I see, I definitely think that that would be, uh -- [NOISE] yeah, that's definitely the case.  Men are, uh -- no, I thi- -- d- -- -nk def- definitely men are -- are much more, uh, willing to do that, more mercenary.
R:  Oh, definitely.  Well -- and I don't think that their friendships have as much -- quite as much significance to them.
L:  Right.
R:  And I hate to sell every man short and generalize --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but I just know from my husband, I mean, you know, they're more like golf buddies or fishing buddies or whatever, you know, whereas my friends -- like, if -- they are there through [NOISE] thick and thin kind of things and it's a little bit different, but, mm ...
L:  Yeah, well, hey, but, like, I said, you know, at a hundred thousand I'd crack, you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] -- they'd, uh -- you'd have to keep, uh, voting them off, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah, well, this knowledge now'll give me food for thought, I'm going to have to start thinking about which ones mean more or which ones [LAUGH] less to me.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, it's, uh -- unfortunately --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I don't think that they're actually going --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- to show for the -- a check, so ...
R:  Wouldn't it be interesting to think of who would you get rid of first?  Oh, I don't know --
L:  Yeah, exactly, so, um, um -- [NOISE] yeah, so, um, [NOISE] -- so, I don't know, but, uh, it's -- you know, it's kind of an odd topic for these guys.
R:  Mm.
L:  I did one other one but, uh, the topic was pets, so ...
R:  Oh --
L:  -- so ...
R:  -- oh, that would have been a nice one, yeah, I didn't -- I didn't have that.  I did one on, uh, education issues and what was the other one -- I don't know.  The other one I really didn't stay on topic too much [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well, there's only a certain amount you can do.  The pets one was kind of odd 'cause the person I talked to literally had, like -- had a dog and three cats and two rabbits and a hamster and -- and it was like -- I could only imagine what the house smelled like or --
R:  [LAUGH] Well, maybe they lived in a rural area?
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, or something, I don't know.  Maybe they were eating them or something --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I'm not sure, but, uh -- yeah --
R:  Yeah, Boston's not conducive to that kind of, uh --
L:  Oh, god no.
R:  -- animal habitat. [LAUGH]
L:  No, we didn't have a lot to talk about 'cause --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- like, I have trouble, like, keeping plants alive.
R:  Oh, do you?
L:  So, it's, like, I'm not going to get -- you know, it's, like, "Oh, yeah, I'm going to get a dog so I can run home and walk it three times a day and, uh, have it, uh, tear up the house because I never pay any attention to it", so ...
R:  Oh.
L:  At least my plants suffer in silence, so ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's one way to look at it .
L:  Exactly.  So, um --
R:  How did you find out about this whole study?
L:  [NOISE] Um, on one of the, um, [LIPSMACK] uh, Internet boards.
R:  Okay, yeah.
L:  Uh, how did you find out about it?
R:  Same thing, yeah.
L:  Oh, did you -- which ones do you -- I -- I like -- the one I spend all my time on is Fat Wallet.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, that's a pretty good one.
R:  I've gone on there a few times, yeah.  No, that's not, um -- it's actually a refunding site that I was on when I saw it.
L:  Okay.  Yeah, Fat Wallet is, uh -- those people on there are just crazy but, you know, sometimes you can find some pretty good things on there, so ...
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, the Internet definitely has, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- oh, been wonderful for me.  I don't know, I just -- I find things on there constantly, I'm, like, amazed by the number of things that come across there, but [LAUGH] --
L:  Right, well two or three years ago, I mean, it was unbelievable, it was really astounding how much -- you know, like companies were just giving stuff away.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  You know, it was just non stop -- I mean, I was just astounded but of course then they all went out of business, so ...
R:  Yeah, all -- all went under, yep. [LAUGH]  Yeah, there's still a few out there but not too many.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  So, but Fat Wallet's pretty good, it kind of has its ups and downs but, you know, every once in a while it -- the problem is -- the only problem is it's a very popular site, so what happens is that if something comes along that's, you know, almost too good to be true, it's --
R:  Yeah, it's gone.
L:  -- gets pulled really quickly. [LAUGH]
R:  That's right, yeah.  Well, I'm finding that more and more with everything on there, um, they jut close them down really fast, you know.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  But there's definitely a, um, you know, this one's --
