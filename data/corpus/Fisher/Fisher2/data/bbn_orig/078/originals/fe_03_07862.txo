R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.  How are you?
R:  Good.  I'm Shannon.
L:  Nice to meet you. [MN]
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  You ever done anything like this before?
R:  [LAUGH] Uh, no.  How about you?
L:  [MN] No, not at all.
R:  [MN] All right, so --
L:  So, are we --are we supposed to talk right away about the topic?
R:  Yeah, we're just supposed -- yeah, I think so.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] all right, you wanna start? [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] Sure.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I guess if I was gonna open my own business right now it would be some sort of restaurant.
R:  Mm.
L:  Maybe just your basic bar and grill or maybe just go the other way and have it be like a Starbucks kind of thing just because those are so popular for some reason.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know, I'm not into the whole coffee and that kind of scene but it seems to work for other people.
R:  Yeah, for sure.
L:  So, I don't know.  And then I think, another thing they ask was how do you go about starting, um, [MN] I guess, I think [MN] -- I don't know, I think I know people that are in the food business that are managers or waiters or whatnot and probably just tell them that I'm starting a business and, uh, see if they'd want to come onboard and go from there, so I don't know.  What about you?
R:  [LAUGH] Um, yeah, I'd probably open a restaurant, too.  It seems like the most fun business I could think of to start.
L:  [MN] Yeah --
R:  Um --
L:  -- I agree.
R:  -- I don't know.  And I've worked in the service industry a lot or, like, while I was in college in stuff, I worked in -- like, waitressing and doing stuff like that so I'm pretty familiar with it. [SIGH] Um, I don't know.  And I think a coffee shop or something like that would be cool.  I have friends in New York who own a teahouse and it does really well.  Like, basically they just serve, like, fifty different kinds of gourmet tea. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And it's so popular, the place is always packed. [MN] And they just have big, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like, big sofas and, you know, people just come in --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and study and hang out and [MN] -- so that seems like a good idea. [NOISE] Um, [MN] I'd probably -- yeah, I'd probably do something where it was, like, low -- low maintenance like either, like, a coffee bar or something where people, like, serve themselves or, like, come up to the counter to get their food.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And not like where you have to have like a wait staff and [MN] busboys and things like that.
L:  And a host and all that thing and a manager and whatnot.
R:  Yeah.  So, seems like the less staff you have to have the easier it probably is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] Um, and how would I go about it? [MN] Um, I don't know.  I guess I'd probably look for [MN] um, a good market to start it in.  Like, a city that, um -- um, a city that, uh, doesn't have a lot of whatever it is that I'd be starting.
L:  Right. [COUGH] [NOISE] I could see that.  I know, uh, I think just -- I was in [inaudible] I'm still in college, in graduate school but I've been in a college town the last ten years and --
R:  [MN]
L:  all of these restaurants always do well there just 'cause younger people, they're not settled down or whatever and they don't, you know, cook as much as --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [NOISE] [MN] families or whatnot and it just seems -- it's very rare that I've seen a restaurant, unless it was just really crappy, for it to go out of business --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in a college town, so ... I used to [MN] live in -- I went to the University of Tennessee in Knoxville and --
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, and I think, uh, I don't know how many people there, like, a hundred and fifty thousand but they had the highest ratio of restaurants to people and I think [MN] in my five years that I lived in Knoxville I saw maybe one restaurant close down so --
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, they do pretty well in college towns.
R:  That's funny 'cause the city I was thinking of was Nashville actually. [LAUGH] I was like --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, what kind of restaurant would I open in Nashville?  So --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- I don't know, I mean, it seems like a tow- -- like, I know it's different than Knoxville but I know that, like, Nashville, like, being a tourist town is already pretty saturated with stuff.
L:  Yeah, that's definitely --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- true.  Are you from that area?
R:  No, I'm actually, um, I live in North Carolina but I'm gonna be moving to Nashville.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, so -- but I've -- I've never been there really. [LAUGH]
L:  It's a pretty fun town.
R:  Yeah, that's what --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I hear.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, so, that was kind of what was in the back of my head.  That's funny. [MN] Um, the other question they asked, let's see, was would you be successful? [MN]
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] well I guess if -- if I had to answer that I would -- I would say yes.  I don't know if they're looking to -- for an arrogant answer or what but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I don't think you'd start a business looking to fail.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh, yeah, I think I'd be smart enough to at least -- I mean, I've -- I've never waited tables or worked in the service industry or anything where I know anything about starting a business but I know a few people that have and I know I would definitely consult them if not hire them to get everything started and if they had to, teach me the ropes, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I would think I'd be able to, uh --
R:  Do [MN] --
L:  -- have a successful business, [inaudible] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know, I think a lot of, like, going back to the restaurant, a lot of them are either formal or just super casual and, uh, it's funny 'cause my girlfriend and I talk about this a lot, she's a health nut and I think --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- on the menus there's probably two things on every menu that she's willing to eat --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's not greasy or whatnot and she's just always, like, "I'd rather -- " she'd want start a restaurant with sandwiches or just things that are really healthy and I think, you know, that's a pretty darn good idea.  A lot of people complain about obesity in America, so ...
R:  For sure.  Yeah, I'm a vegetarian and I know there's not a lot of vegetarian restaurants in most towns, you know? [MN]
L:  Yeah, that's very true.
R:  So, I think that would be a good -- at least to have, like, you know, that kind of option on it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, vegetarian options on menus and healthy options.  I think people are getting smarter about, like, [SIGH] what they're eating and realising [PAUSE] --
L:  Yeah, I think --
R:  -- about that.
L:  -- [MN] the vegetarian options right now are the side items, I think, at most restaurants.
R:  Yeah, for sure. [LAUGH] Appetizers. [LAUGH]
L:  But, yeah, I think [MN] even a lot of the fast food places are starting to offer salads even though a lot of them have, like, fried chicken on their salads but --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- at least they're trying to do a little something instead of greasy burgers and whatnot [NOISE] so ...
R:  Um [MN] --
L:  Yeah, I don't -- other than a restaurant I actually have a friend that -- have you heard of Marble Slab?
R:  Mm mm.
L:  It's -- it's just an ice cream place --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- where --
R:  Oh, yeah!  I have actually.  I did [inaudible] --
L:  Yeah, and they, like, flap the ice cream around, I don't know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but people seem to like it and he opened one a few years ago actually in South Carolina --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- Greenville and he's got, like, four now so I think --
R:  Whoa.
L:  -- ice cream if you're in a college town -- you've got, you know, a lot of coeds and, uh, just younger people and if it's h- -- if you're in a mild climate --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- Florida or something like that and you've got an ice cream stand it -- it, uh, seems to do pretty good.  I -- I live in Wingsburg[?] right now and, um, they've got a place called Brewsters.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it's -- it's close to my house and I think every, you know, regardless of the time, if it's noon or three o'clock in the afternoon, there's just a ton of people out there, so ...
R:  Yeah.  That makes sense.  What do you do in the winter though, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's the thing, you --
R:  You'd have to do something else. [LAUGH]
L:  -- you close down or you put hot chocolate out there or something --
R:  Yeah, su- --
L:  -- I don't know.
R:  You go -- you go on vacation.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  That'd be a good thing. [MN] Or the other thing I was thinking in college towns or in tourist towns is places that have, like, live music --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- at night.  Like, if even if it's a real casual place, like even if it's a coffee shop, if they have, like, free live music I think that that's a big draw.
L:  Yeah, and I think, um, a lot of people would think, you know, that's expensive to get a band but a lot of the musicians just want a place to play.
R:  Mhm, especially in college towns.
L:  Yeah, they just, you know, want to get their music out there and their names and see what comes from that.  But, yeah, the -- there's not enough places that they don't, uh, put their name out there enough to where they have live music and just kind of -- there's a difference between live music and then you get a -- or a cover band where it's just --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- really loud --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and [inaudible] and you've got to scream to talk to the person beside you and it turns into a very annoying situation.  But if you get someone out there that's just kinda like a one or two person band and, you know, one of them's playing the guitar or the piano or whatever where you can still have a conversation, that's a pretty good idea.
R:  Yeah, for sure.
L:  [MN], I don't know.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  So, you think you'd be successful?
R:  [MN] Um, I don't know.  I mean, I think I'd be pretty good at the aesthetic parts of it, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, decorating and menu stuff and being social but I'm not sure about all the financial stuff and all the --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like, the business stuff that goes along with it.  I think [MN] all that sh- -- all that stuff confuses me and all the -- the -- the legalities of it as far as like what kind of permits you have to get and taxes you have to pay.  I guess if --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- if --
L:  -- that's true.
R:  -- if money wasn't an option though, which was one of those things --
L:  I don't know.
R:  -- like, then you just hire somebody to do all that anyway, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  So, I guess it would be fun.  So, yeah, I think it'd be -- I think it would be successful.  I think if money wasn't an option, that's kind of a strange question, "Would you be successful?" 'cause if money wasn't an issue --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and it wasn't being successful you could just tinker around with it and, you know --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- do whatever you needed to do.
L:  -- it wouldn't be a big deal.  I was gonna say the same thing, if money's not an option then sure it'll be successful --
R:  Of c- [LAUGH] --
L:  -- you could just pour a ton of money into it.
R:  Exactly.
L:  So --
R:  Give aw- -- give away free food for, like, the first month you're open.
L:  Yeah, why --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- not.
R:  [MN] Free samples and stuff.
