R:  Hi, I'm Jackie.
L:  Hi, I'm Karen.
R:  Oh, nice to meet you. [LAUGH]
L:  You too.
R:  Even over the phone.  This is interesting, I've not done this before, so [LAUGH] --
L:  Well this -- well this --
R:  This is new.
L:  This is my third time.
R:  Oh, is it?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, so then, uh, you've t- -- every time it's different?  That you talk about?
L:  Correct.
R:  Okay.  Mm 'kay.
L:  How did you find out about it?
R:  Over the internet.  Somebody, um, one of these newsletters that I, um, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Subscribe to?
R:  -- [MN] get in -- yeah, [MN] gosh, can't even talk!  Um, they s- mentioned it, so then I went there and figured since they mentioned it, it wasn't bogus, so [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I went ahead and tried it.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  Well, it's fun, I mean, and, you know, it's nice to have a little extra income.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Well now, do you -- I don't know if this continues or not, so, [LIPSMACK] I don't know, it'd be interesting to see if [LAUGH] it's worth it.
L:  My understa- -- my understanding --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is that we're allowed to do three calls.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Uh --
L:  Is that -- is that what you th- thought?
R:  Right, right.
L:  Okay.
R:  And then I didn't know if there were more s- studies or what happens, but hey, we'll see. [LAUGH]
L:  Right!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I know I -- I think I talked to someone, um, uh, on the phone in person, you know --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- and they said that you could put your name down, uh, for further studies, so you might want to --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- inve- investigate that.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I will do that.
L:  So, uh, do you stay at home?
R:  Most of the time, I work, um, just as needed and, um, so I'm home a lot, yeah.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.  So I'm not leaving the United States [LAUGH] even for a million dollars. [LAUGH]
L:  Right. [LAUGH]  Amen.  [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  And they talked about where, um, [LIPSMACK] where you would go and I don't know where I'd go 'cause I can't speak another language either --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I'm not real into [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- learning them.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So I think we're supposed to talk about minimum wage.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- Is that what the topic --
R:  Oh no, no, mine sai- -- no, they said about a million dollars for leaving the United States and never returning, would you take that deal?  And what would you miss most and what would you not miss, where would you go?  That kind of thing.
L:  Oh!  'Cause they said my topic -- oh, I guess I'd rather go with your topic! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yes!
L:  They told me that we were talking about, um, minimum wage.
R:  Oh.
L:  So --
R:  Well now, d- just a minute ago before we introduced ourselves, did they talk about that?  The -- I mean, is that what they said?  'Cause on mine they said the million dollars.
L:  Okay.
R:  It said, "Welcome to both of you" so I thought you were listening at the same time I was --
L:  No.
R:  -- so maybe not.  Oh.
L:  But it took -- because when I first said hello the other two times everybody was really right there and I -- 'cause I said, "Hello?  Hello?" [LAUGH] about --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- three times, so maybe --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- maybe they crossed me or crossed us, with each other.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, I don't know.
L:  So n- --
R:  Well I don't know, they said the million dollars, that sounded easy to me! [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, um, I guess we'll talk about that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So what -- what was it now?
R:  Uh, [MN] if somebody offered you a million dollars to leave the States and never come back would you take it, and if you would, where would you go?
L:  Oh, I -- I'm with you, I don't think --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I would.
R:  I know.
L:  No.
R:  I -- the -- especially with the war and everything.
L:  Right.
R:  It's like we find out how other people really live. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  [MN]
L:  I don't -- I don't think it -- for me personally it wouldn't be right to give up my American citizenship.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, a million dollars would be great [LAUGH] but --
R:  [MN] Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- I mean --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I would not be wil- -- you know, willing to do that.
R:  Yeah.  Well I wonder if many respondents would?  I guess some people would, they w- -- well you know what?  You could go like, to Canada, they speak English a lotta places.
L:  Right.
R:  And Eur- -- some of the European countries, that wouldn't be too bad.
L:  No.
R:  But I still wouldn't go. [LAUGH]
L:  No.
R:  We -- we've been in China already and -- and some other third world countries and it's like, no way, I'm just so thankful to get back. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Was it like a missionary trip?
R:  No, we just went, my husband was interested and -- in those countries -- and so we just kinda went for a --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- couple of weeks and, you know, it was -- it was interesting but no way would I wanna do it, and of course we're very thankful, when we're over there, about America, and then we come back and we forget, you know --
L:  Correct.
R:  -- w- uh, what it's like.  But, uh --
L:  Right.
R:  But just with those experiences, no way am I going somewhere [LAUGH].
L:  No.
R:  Two weeks was more than enough. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, correct.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  I don't know, I ju- -- I just, you know, there are so many negative things in America but I -- I do believe, um, as American people, uh, persevere and try to get back to some -- some sensible roots --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that, um, you know, we can get back to what is most important.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I don't know that that -- you would have that camaraderie, I mean, I h- how do I know?  But you know, just from things you read, you know, uh, and understand about third world countries or even prosperous countries, you know, it -- it doesn't seem to have, uh, the camaraderie that we do here.
R:  Mhm, that's right.
L:  Do you remember when that little girl fell down a well and --
R:  [SIGH] Yes, mhm.
L:  I mean, it's been like, uh, at least th- the last nine years I'm sure.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, it seemed like America pulled together.
R:  That's true.  The same way with the miners in Pennsylvania.
L:  Correct.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Correct.
R:  Yeah.  That's it -- that's probably true, I hadn't thought about that.  I -- I think about how to make a living and all those kinds of things in another countries -- I don't -- I'm not a real women's libber but at least --
L:  Me neither.
R:  -- here I know I'm gonna get a job, you know [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that kinda -- kind of thing and, I don't know, in other countries the way they treat women a lot of the times.  And not even like the Arab countries but just generally, uh, sometimes they don't have that opportunity.
L:  Correct.
R:  And so [LIPSMACK] yeah, I'm --
L:  No, I'm --
R:  -- staying here.  I figure God put me here, I'm staying. [LAUGH]
L:  Amen! [LAUGH]  I mean, I'm -- I'm the for the -- for the same -- from a women's libber, you know, I just, I feel like, you know, [SIGH] there is so much potential for women but I believe that we need to do it under a particular authority and not just --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, throw our bras all over the place --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [inaudible].  But it's just -- it's just that, you know, in other countries, you know, um, I mean, my husband said, I think it's -- oh, is it Sweden? [MN]  You know, that would seem appealing but he said, um, that particular country is -- is, um, their morals are just down the tubes.
R:  Yes, yeah, that's probably where it is.  I have a friend who was, uh, of Swedish descent and she went back there and, uh, she belongs to like, a fundamental church and things.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh my gosh, she said it was just amazing --
L:  Right.
R:  -- uh, how different and how liberal they were.  So I don't want my kids growing up there [LAUGH].
L:  No, no.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh jeez.
L:  And I know even -- I -- I had [MN] some folks I knew that were missionaries, I wanna say -- I wanna say Spain but, you know, my mind is -- is blocked.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, I -- she said it was nothing for women to walk around unclothed --
R:  Oh really?
L:  -- on the top.  On the top.
R:  Jeez! [LAUGH] 
L:  She said, you know, uh, yeah, and it was just -- it was r- you know, rather startling.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know.  But I can't r- -- I can't remember the country, I've drawn a blank.
R:  Hm.
L:  But I think it was -- I think it was Spain.  But anyway, after I get off I'll remember.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Where -- where in the country do you live?
R:  I live in Pennsylvania.
L:  Okay.  I'm in --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- Ohio.
R:  Oh, okay, so we're not real far apart. [LAUGH]
L:  No, no.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you've lived there all the time?
L:  Most -- most --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of my, uh, you know, most of my life.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, I think -- I lived about -- from birth until about th- aged thirty I lived, um, [LIPSMACK] in Michigan.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then about, you know, um, oh dear, thirteen years ago I moved to Ohio but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I mean, Michigan is just a stone throw --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- 'cause, you know, we're close to the border.
R:  I guess it is, I don't think of it that way, I think that it's further but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- when you look at a map you're right. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  Right.
L:  So --
R:  But -- yeah.
L:  So h- how --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- do you like Pennsylvania?
R:  Um, I like it.  My husband's talking about maybe going to Arizona but I've always been here too, you know, I haven't moved around a lot and -- and I'm happy with it.  I like the change of seasons and all that kinda stuff.
L:  Right.
R:  So, yeah.
L:  We'll stay in America!
R:  Yeah! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's right! [LAUGH]
L:  From sea to --
R:  That's right!
L:  -- shiny sea.
R:  Yeah! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Otherwise we -- I mean, we could still go to Hawaii and stuff except we won't have the --
L:  Correct.
R:  -- million dollars to do it with, but [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I would -- I would really enjoy going to, um, Colonial Williamsburg.
R:  Oh, that's wonderful.
L:  Have you been there?
R:  Yeah, I've been there, it's really interesting, yeah.
L:  Yeah, that would be, um -- and really, [MN] um, one place we would like to live would be Prince Edward Island because --
R:  [SIGH] Uh --
L:  -- we're Anne of Green Gables fans.
R:  Yeah -- oh, my friend I -- really, really likes her so I've seen some of the -- the movies and things like that, yeah.
L:  But it's --
R:  I've never been there, have you --
L:  Me n- [MN] --
R:  -- been?
L:  No.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but, you know, we would like to go and it -- it's, you know, it probably would be a fairly modestly priced trip but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's, um, you know, I -- I wouldn't wa- -- I probably would not wanna give up my citizenship even for PEI. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right, right.  Yeah.
L:  So not even for a million dollars.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It could be a little tempting but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But --
R:  And the thing of it is, in these days a million dollars doesn't go quite so far --
L:  No.
R:  -- till you paid all your expenses, got a new house, did everything [LAUGH].
L:  Right, right, absolute- --
R:  Yeah.  Uh --
L:  So do all your children live in the States?
R:  Actually, I don't have any kids.  When I was -- when I made that comment I was just thinking, "Well, I don't even have any kids, I don't have to worry about 'em moving" [LAUGH] but --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- no. [LAUGH] 
L:  That's true.
R:  No.  Do yours?
L:  [SIGH] Everyone lives, yeah, close by.
R:  Oh good, good.
L:  So, but, um, [LIPSMACK] yeah, the United -- I mean, the United States is under a terrific attack, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with
