L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hi.
L:  [NOISE] Hi.
R:  This is Julia.
L:  This is David.
R:  David, have you done this before?
L:  Yeah, once.
R:  Me, too, [NOISE] basically. [MN] Um, so, what would -- what do you think?  Is it one million dollars or ten million dollars?
L:  I think she said one million.
R:  Yeah, that's not that much.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, it --
R:  You know?
L:  [MN] Oh, really?  It sounds like a lot to me. [MN] 
R:  [MN] Well, I mean in terms of living off the rest of your life.
L:  [NOISE] That's true.  Now, w- where are you from?
R:  I'm from Boston.
L:  Boston.
R:  Yourself?
L:  Uh, I'm from Vancouver actually.
R:  Huh.
L:  So, [LAUGH] I'm planning to return home in a few years.
R:  Where are you from originally?
L:  Yeah, Vancouver, British Columbia, actually.
R:  Oh, you're from Vancouver and you're in there now.
L:  [MN] No, I'm -- I live in California now. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, okay.  So, you'd be fine going -- taking the money --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and going.
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  Plus in Canada I guess it's -- it's worth more.  But, see, if I went to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like, Europe, dollar doesn't go very far. [MN]
L:  Huh.
R:  [MN] You'd have to move to, like, a third world country where you could make it stretch.
L:  You could go to Mexico.  Some Americans retire in Mexico --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- now, I think.
R:  That's true. [MN] 
L:  [MN]
R:  Although I guess it would be weird to leave your f- -- oh, well, your family's probably all in Canada --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- then?
L:  Well, not all of them but my parents are there.
R:  So, do you have family in the U.S.? [NOISE]
L:  I do in New York State.
R:  Huh. [MN] So, you wouldn't mind never being able to go visit them? [NOISE]
L:  No, I w- -- I -- I guess I wouldn't.  I'm not [MN] in touch with them.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  See, I -- I have way too much family in the U.S. [NOISE], all my -- pretty much all my family --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is here, so [MN] I don't think I could do it.
L:  Wow.
R:  [MN] The thing is, I grew up in the Philippines, like --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- for thirteen years, so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I mean, considering that, I -- I -- but I always -- I would think that it would be easier for me, but I've always come back to the States --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and it's been a big part of like, identifying with, like, my nationality, you know, it's c- -- being able to come --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- back. [MN] 'Cause if I was just in the Philippines I think I'd lose touch of what it's, you know, [MN] being American's all about.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] [MN] I don't know, I guess I think I'd wanna come back. [MN]
L:  What being American's all about, so -- so, you can talk about that.  What -- what do you think it's all about?  That goes under, what would you miss. [MN]
R:  Um, [MN] I don't know, just how, like, just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- convenience and [MN] fast pace, excitement.  I'm talking about just, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- things I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I love about the States. [MN] Just choice and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- free, you know, 'cause you can get anything, anytime.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Or like, growing --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- up in the Philippines, you know, you went to the supermarket you never knew what cereal brand they were gonna have, you know?
L:  Mm.
R:  Sometimes they [MN] didn't have any U.S. cereal brands, they only had, you know, Swedish --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- cereal brands and [MN] it was just -- I always loved coming back and, like, being able to get whatever I wanted, you know?
L:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
R:  [MN] And stupid little things like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- cereal in the morning. [MN] Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and even, like, going shopping or, you know, it's -- everything's just so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- easy here.
L:  [MN] Mhm.
R:  I guess.
L:  Oh, that's interesting.  Huh.  But -- but that million bucks would go a long way.  You'd -- if you didn't have to work as much you'd have more time to go shopping.
R:  Yeah, but if -- [MN] my family, I wouldn't see my family though.
L:  Oh.
R:  [MN]
L:  So, they're all over in the States now?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh.
R:  I feel like it's like one of those things you can always say, "Everyone come visit me" --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- but no one ever does that.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's like I'm always the one who m- motivates to go see people, you know? [MN] 'Cause a lot of people don't regret ma- -- you know, it's easier for people to come visit them.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Like --
L:  [MN]
R:  growing up -- growing up abroad for thirteen years, like, one set of aunt and uncle and my grandparents came to visit, the whole time, and that was with a free plane ticket.  My dad used to work [MN] with the airline so he always offered free ticket if anyone ever wanted to come but, like, it was just too much --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of a pain, no one wanted to come, you know?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, that's what I'd be afraid of if I moved away, that I would never be able to get anyone to m- --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- come visit, you know? [NOISE] [MN] But --
L:  Huh.
R:  [MN] Plus it's just like, it's like selling a part of your freedom to say, like, "Okay, I can never come back here again" you know?
L:  Yeah, [MN] it -- it is.
R:  [MN] Eliminating your choice. [NOISE]
L:  That's true.
R:  I don't know.
L:  [MN]
R:  It's like, would you spend a night with someone for a million dollars?  Even if you didn't have to do anything --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know?  I still don't think I'd do it.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Just 'cause it's weird.
L:  Huh.
R:  [NOISE] [MN] W- --
L:  Like, maybe -- maybe you like your job [LAUGH] more than I like mine? [LAUGH]
R:  What do you do?
L:  It sounds pretty good to me.  Oh, I'm a grad student, I like it but it -- it's not as much fun as getting paid to do nothing. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  If a million dollars will last you, like, ten years, maybe.
L:  Oh, yeah, they didn't say if it was tax free or not, did they? [MN]
R:  No.
L:  Ugh. 
R:  That's a big difference.
L:  [MN]
R:  You're right.
L:  [MN]
R:  I didn't think about that part.  Usually there's a glitch though --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know? [LAUGH] It's -- it's not like they're -- and it's like, are you going to get all million dollars up front or do you get part of it now and part of it later? [MN]
L:  [MN]
R:  I don't know.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  So, you wouldn't miss your job?  What are you studying to be?
L:  [MN] Oh, I'm -- I'm studying, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [MN] electrical engineering.
R:  Okay.
L:  But then, like, the job, you know, I could do that in Canada.  It wouldn't be like I was giving up my career, not at all.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] Um, I'm just wondering how ea- -- what would you have to do to get, like, citizenship somewhere else, you know?  If you're going to live --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- somewhere --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- won't you need -- well you have -- you don't have that problem. [NOISE]
L:  Well, you know, you don't need citizenship, you just need a work permit really --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then you can live.
R:  A lot of places are picky about that kind of thing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know?  You have to, like [NOISE] -- like, I went to study abroad in Spain for six months and it was the hugest deal trying to get a visa just for --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- a student visa let alone, like, trying to get a work permit.
L:  Huh.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Well --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- hm, with -- with NAFTA you're allowed to work in Mexico or Canada depending on what your career is.  If you have the right credentials you're allowed.
R:  [MN] Yeah, just what are you going to do in Mexico, you know?
L:  I -- I don't know.
R:  How come we can go work in Mexico and they can't come work here?
L:  They can.
R:  They can?
L:  They -- if -- if they have one of those professions which is under NAFTA.
R:  Oh, okay. [NOISE] I don't really know much about that.
L:  Well, I -- I know about it 'cause I used it 'cause I used to work in the States as a engineer and that was on a NAFTA visa.
R:  [MN] Oh.  So, what if -- like, so Canadians can work in the U.S. if they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- want to but they just can only do it under certain professions? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  Oh.  What else, besides engineers?
L:  Oh, um, [SIGH] oh you know what, I -- I don't remember [LAUGH].
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I just had my eye on my own little piece of the pie. [SIGH] Um ...
R:  'Cause I have a friend that's here in Boston from Montreal that's doing -- he's doing, like, hedge funds it's like in finance.  I just wondered if that's because he's a professional or did he have to get sponsored or ... ?
L:  Um, even with that you need to get sponsored.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] Huh. [MN] I just remember when I was -- when I got out of college trying to applying for -- first thing I wanted to do was work abroad, you know?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Like, I wanted to get out of the States and go work in, like, Rome --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or something. [MN] And, like, no companies want to sponsor you, you know, they would rather hire someone local.
L:  Huh.
R:  [MN] I wouldn't miss my job though, I don't have any attachments.
L:  You wouldn't mi- [LAUGH] ...
R:  It's the kind of thing where if I moved away somewhere like, to the beach, I'd probably not be that worried about my job, you know?
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Or a job.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  If I had a million dollars too, it'd have to make it, you know, worth something. [NOISE] Um, [MN] so what else did they ask us to talk about --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- besides --
L:  [MN] Um --
R:  -- what would we miss?
L:  [MN] -- what would we not miss. [LAUGH]
R:  Hm.
L:  [MN] I -- I wouldn't miss the crime.
R:  Yeah, but these [inaudible] crimes -- well, depends where you're moving to. [MN] See, like, if you move to, like -- like if I moved back to the Philippines for instance --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there's so many, like, thefts and, you know, pickpocketing and --
L:  Oh yeah, huh.
R:  -- different types of crimes, you know?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH] [COUGH] Driving's scarier.
L:  Huh.
R:  [MN] Like, in the States it's so easy to do -- like, to buy a car even.  You know, like, [MN] in the Philippines you have to wait on the wait list for, like, a year to get a new car.  I don't know.
L:  Huh.
R:  I'm trying to think what other things I would miss.  Mm, I think food would be a huge problem for me.  To be --
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- able to eat out --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- any type of food all the time, you know?
L:  Huh, well you could -- where are -- where are you?  Boston.  You could move up to Toronto, there's probably as much variety up there, [MN] as far as restaurants go.
R:  Yeah. [MN] Well, I think Canada's very similar.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What is it -- wha- -- [MN] would you say the [MN] differences are that you would --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- have in Canada that you wouldn't have here?
L:  Um, just comparing Vancouver to where I'm living now, um, near -- near Oakland, um, I would say, uh, well, the crime rate's higher here, it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, you can make more money here if you have the right job.  Um, [MN] and that's --
