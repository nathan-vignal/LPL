L:  Hi, I'm Robert.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello
L:  Hello.
R:  Can you hear me?
L:  Yes, I can.
L:  What?
L:  I said, "Yes, I can".
R:  Oh, I'm Rhonda.
L:  Hey, Rhonda, I'm Robert.
R:  Hi, Robert. [NOISE]
L:  Well, it's a kind of unusual topic, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, if you were offered a million dollars would you never speak to your best friends again?
R:  No, best frien- friends or friend?
L:  Best friends, I think it's plural --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- all of them .
R:  A million dollars is a lot of money.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's, uh, um, yes, it is a, um, a good chunk of money and, um -- but, gosh, you know, I've had some of the same friends now for almost thirty years so [LAUGH] I'm not sure if, uh, that would be enough.  Five million, uh, yeah, we might talk about it, but a million, I don't know.
R:  I don't know what I'd do.
L:  Yes, well the situation is where you just really have no idea what you truly would do until you're actually presented with it, and, uh --
R:  I mean --
L:  -- gosh, who knows.
R:  There are times that I have gotten mad at my very best friend and -- and not spoken to him for a year.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, friends fight but, uh, you know --
R:  So, I don't know what I'd do.
L:  Yeah, my best friends are all -- I've been friends with all these people now all -- all well in excess of twenty years, so ...
R:  Uh, tha- -- well that's about the same over here.
L:  Some pre- some pretty deep bonds there. [NOISE]
R:  But, a million dollars goes a long way.
L:  Oh, yeah.  And I wonder if it's taxable? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [COUGH] 'Cause that changes the equation there, it makes it less enticing.
R:  I- it -- that was a very good observation.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Where are --
L:  If --
R:  -- you at -- where are you at of?
L:  I- I'm in Dallas.
R:  I'm in New York.
L:  Okay.
R:  New York City.
L:  What borough?
R:  Queens.
L:  You're out in Queens, okay.
R:  How do you know about the boroughs?
L:  Well, I -- shit, I've been all over the world, I've been to New York, uh, several times.  Um, I used to fl- -- I usually wound up flying through there at least about once or twice a year --
R:  Uh, that's why you know.
L:  -- I'd go through JFK.  Mm?
R:  That's why you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm in the middle of Kennedy and La Guardia.
L:  Yeah, if you're in Queens you're close to Kennedy.
R:  I'm in the middle of both airports.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah. [LIPSMACK] It's -- it's -- it's well located.
L:  I knew some people from Queens years ago, people, like, had moved to Texas who lived here, uh -- but, uh -- yeah, I haven't been in the mid town now in quite a while and the last time I w- went there I flew to La Guardia and took the Kerry[?] bus in and, uh, there's a nut on the bus starts singing That's Entertainment as we're going through one of those tunnels, uh, coming into mid town.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, but, uh, yeah, I like New York.  New York's a -- a kind of a neat place.  My aunt lived there for a number of years, uh, and always enjoyed it.
R:  I know people that have moved from Manhattan to Texas and like it.
L:  Well, Texas is a great place.  In fact, most of the northerners who move down here --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, usually the first summer can be tough on them and then after that, uh, they usually --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just almost all just love it.  Um, I used to work for Fidelity Investments and of course we had a lot of Bostonians who would, uh, you know, come down to Texas and, uh, usually -- again, the first summer's tough but after that, yeah, you're in.  It's a whole different way of living [LAUGH] just -- it really depends what you like.
R:  A slower way of living?
L:  A lot different, I mean, it's -- it's -- the cost of living is a lot lower down here obviously and you keep a pretty high standard of living on a, uh, lot less of an income that would be necessary, like, a place in like New York.
R:  That sounds inviting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But that's why the million dollars sounds inviting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Take the million dollars and move to Texas.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] Make new best friends.
L:  Well, it's a good place, it really is.  I've, um -- like, 'cause I've been all over the world, I, um -- I go to Europe several times a year, I'm heading off to Singapore here in about three weeks and --
R:  Are you with the --
L:  -- I've been probably to literally every major metropolitan area in this country and, um, besides Dallas, Fort --
R:  Are you with the airline industry?
L:  -- Worth [MN] -- I'm sorry?
R:  Are you with the airline industry?
L:  No, I'm not, no.
R:  This is personal travel or business travel?
L:  Uh, it can be a combination of both, but, um, the upcoming, uh, Singapore trip's actually a personal one.  But, uh, besides Dallas, Fort Worth, probably the best metropolitan area I think to live in is Atlanta, Georgia.  I really like Atlanta too.
R:  Atlanta's got its pros and cons.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  I'd rather stay in New York than move --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to Atlanta.
L:  [LAUGH] And Houston's pretty nice, course Houston's big.  Um, for a smaller metropolitan area you can't go wrong with Austin, Texas.  Austin's really nice.
R:  I've never been out to Texas through the -- throughout the whole East Coast, mostly Europe and the Caribbean, but not out, uh -- out that way.
L:  [NOISE] Won't don't ya come on down here some time.  It's, uh -- I mean, it's got a lot of good things to do, it really depends what you like.  But, um, yeah, it's a -- um, that's the place to go, if you get your million dollars, uh, from this anonymous benefactor, it definitely will go a lot further down here, uh, than it would up in -- up in New York.
R:  Go even further in the Dominican Republic.
L:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it would go pretty far down there or in a place like Costa Rica or even Belize --
R:  Costa Rica's another one.
L:  Mm, I'm sorry?
R:  Costa Rica's another place.
L:  Yeah, yeah, that's real pretty I was there about that back in, uh, ninety eight actually or nineteen ninety nine, February ninety nine I went to Costa Rica.
R:  Uh, you really like to travel?
L:  Well, yeah.  Yeah, I go -- I actually went down there for a wedding.  Uh, a good friend of mine, he and his wife got -- they, um, got married down there.  So, about forty of us, uh, went down, uh, for this big wedding, it lasted really a whole week.  We spent about, uh, two days in San Jose then went out to a town called Quepos on the Pacific coast right by the, uh, Manuel Antonio National Park in -- in Costa Rica.  They had the wedding there and spent, like, three days there, then, uh, back to San Jose for one more night.  But, uh, that was real, uh -- real fun, uh, a lot of good friends went down there.
R:  Have you always lived in Texas?
L:  Um, actually, yes, I have.  I've lived in different parts of Texas but I've always lived here. [NOISE]
R:  And why do you say that, uh, if you can get through the first summer?
L:  Well, the heat, [NOISE] I mean --
R:  But --
L:  -- people, uh, at times are -- aren't used to hundred and five, hundred and six degree heat.
R:  We're -- we're a hundred degrees today.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, we had a summer like this last summer.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It wa- --
L:  Yeah, often it can last a little longer down here too.  I mean, we've had -- uh, two times now in the last twenty years we've had summers where we've had forty plus consecutive days of hundred plus temperature.
R:  Oh, that's horrible.
L:  So, it's, uh -- happened in nineteen eighty and it happened again about two years ago, I think it was, uh, two thousand and one that summer was -- we had, like, uh, forty three, forty four days stretch of a hundred plus.
R:  [NOISE] See, we were cold and raining until two days ago and this Saturday -- this -- this Saturday, Sunday was fifty degrees here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then it just jumped to ninety something with a very high heat index and ozone alert.
L:  Well, I hope you guys hold on out there and everybody has AC up there, air conditioning.
R:  That's why I'm making the phone call today.
L:  Why's that?
R:  It's too hot to be out running around.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I remembered to make my phone call.  I went out early and did all my stuff.  So, I remembered to make to make the phone call today.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  How many of these have you done?
R:  This is the second one.
L:  Well, it's my third.
R:  I had done the first one a long time ago, then they changed their procedure and I just kept forgetting to call -- to -- to call in and I called in the other day -- got too busy.
L:  Well, it's, uh -- it's really interesting what we're doing.  Uh, I've had a couple, uh -- previous topics were minimum wage and then, uh, on sports before that.
R:  I think --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that my first topic was, um, illness, like, colds and stuff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Do you think the topics are -- are meant to be discussed as topics or as a way to lead into other discussions?
L:  It's all  [inaudible] discussions it seems like or close to it.  I mean, it's, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, the topic of, uh, would you -- would you ditch all your friends for a million dollars, um, it's kind of har- -- almost --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- hard to stretch it out for ten minutes --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um --
R:  If it was only one friend I think I could do it.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I -- I thought it was really tough, like, I don't think I could do it for a million.  Uh, five million we could talk about it.
R:  Now, I'm not saying all my friends, but one friend.
L:  Yeah.
R:  As long as the million dollars wasn't taxable --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  -- that it was tax free it would allow me to do a whole lot of things --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that I want to do in life.
L:  Yeah, what would you want to do?
R:  I don't know, I don't know.
L:  Well, I would --
R:  I guess it would give me -- okay, it would give me the freedom to -- to travel more and -- and have more space, in terms of living space.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because in New York, space is at a premium.  Um, it -- it would also give me, um, [NOISE] uh, a cushion that if I wanted to pick up and relocate, I could do it with no worries.
L:  Well, that's true, I mean, it's, uh -- any place that, like, New York or San Francisco --
