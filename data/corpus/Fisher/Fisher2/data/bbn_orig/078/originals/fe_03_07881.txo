R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi. [LAUGH] My name is Jessie, what's your name?
L:  I'm Don.
R:  Don, did your hear the question?
L:  Yes, uh --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- if you got, uh -- if you were offered a million dollars but you could never speak to your best friend again as a result of it, would you accept a million dollars?
R:  Uh, would you do?
L:  I don't think so, no.  Friendships --
R:  I don't think so either. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, okay then, that's it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No, but --
L:  Okay, why?
R:  But how -- my -- why?
L:  Yes.
R:  That's just too much.  Like, I mean, yeah, a thou- a million dollars would be great but I think that would be fate --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that I'm not supposed to have, but if that means I couldn't talk to my best friend --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, you know, it's not just any friend, it's, like, your best friend. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I know, I know.
R:  I don't think I could do it.
L:  Friendship is much more valuable to me. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I think so too.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I -- I'd rather be happy than rich. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, yeah, well you know, the thing is that I am happy rather than being rich.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, are you happy?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  I think so.  Well, I'm unemployed right now but, you know ... [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm, okay, so -- I've been unemployed, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I'm fortunately employed now but, uh, it sounds like I'm a good deal older than you so ... [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  I guess that's -- you know.  Anyway, wow -- well, um, you know -- I don't know, I've had sh- -- uh, being unemployed has been a very good experience for me actually --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- at various times, I've learned from it.  Of course that's a very saturnine sort of thing to say, "As well, you can learn from it".
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But the -- mhm.
R:  Um, I don't know but we're supposed to, like, keep talking about this topic for ten minutes. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, okay -- no, I think what we're talking about here is values --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- what's really important?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Right?  Friendship --
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  -- as opposed to money.  I mean, you know, you need money to live but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- what's the -- [SIGH] I mean, you know, I -- okay, I like to eat.  Okay --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's very important to eat, you know.  Without eating I'd die, okay?
R:  Right.
L:  And I enjoy eating, um, and I need money to eat, okay?
R:  Mm.
L:  But, I don't know, would I rather just eat every day and not have anyone to talk to?
R:  [LAUGH] What's your answer?
L:  My answer is I would rather talk with people.
R:  Than eat?
L:  Well, I mean, that means if I -- okay, if I don't eat at all then I won't be able to talk with anyone, that's true.
R:  Right.
L:  But I don't need a million dollars --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to ensure that I eat --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know.
R:  That's true, I agree with you.
L:  Okay, yeah.  Okay, well we've taken care of that then --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that's -- that's neat, um --
R:  Um --
L:  -- yeah?
R:  -- if they offered you a million dollars to not talk to a family member, would you do -- maybe a sibling?
L:  Ooh, I only have one sibling in the world and that's my sister --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH] No, no, I don't think so.  They're things that just go too deeply for that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know.  Even though my sister --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I do have our, um, instances of not seeing eye to eye --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know.  Uh, you know, it's kind of how I -- now, of course my grandmother, may she rest in peace --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- didn't talk to her sister for about forty years --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- because her sister had borrowed twenty five dollars in the Depression from my grandmother --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and never paid it back.
R:  Had borrowed what?
L:  Twenty five dollars.
R:  Oh, and never paid it back?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so she never talked to her for years?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah, I mean, there's -- it -- I -- I think -- I think they, uh -- there was a disagreement as to whether it had been paid back or not, I don't know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know.  But, no -- so I -- I -- I have actual real experience.  I mean, I never met my grandmother's sister --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and this was, you know, uh, li- -- I mean, this is -- I -- it was just a story that we heard after -- around the time --
R:  Uh, later --
L:  -- my grandmother died.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, it -- you know, it wasn't really real to me but then I could -- uh, my grandmother was a very unforgiving person in that sense.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  She held on -- she was right and she would not surrender her dignity by talking to that sister who had refused to repay the twenty five dollars.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm.
R:  That's interesting.
L:  Well, okay.  So, no, I'm not like my grandmother --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- there we go.
R:  That's good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  Um --
L:  Mm?
R:  -- what about -- [SIGH] oh, how can we expand on this one?  I don't know.
L:  Well, sh- should I ask if -- if you're, you know, uh, unemployed now, does -- that means, I guess, that you're in between jobs?
R:  Yeah, well actually I just had an accident so I've been sitting at home --
L:  Oh, my gosh, really?
R:  -- and -- yeah.  But, I mean, not a big accident just a small one, so I just decided oh -- well they couldn't give me that many days off so I've just been unemployed.  But, I -- I mean, I'm a registered nurse so it won't be hard --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- to find a job again.
L:  You know, I used to teach, uh, for St. Francis College in [inaudible], Illinois.  I wasn't in there but they had an extension division in P- -- in Philadelphia -- a number of them, where -- I live in Philadelphia -- where I would teach classes that were  -- it was designed for registered nurses --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that, uh, they would take, like, um, you know, the -- the -- the non registered nursing courses and kind of, uh, add it on to the registered nurses degrees and then they would get a bachelor's degree.  So, I -- I've had a lot of experience teaching registered nurses.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, from -- from people in their twenties to people in their sixties --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and that -- that was just re- -- uh, you know -- and also I went to massage school a number of years ago and a number of the people there were either RNs or LPNs --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I just have a real, real respect for registered nurses --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's neat.  So, you're taking care of yourself now?
R:  Yes --
L:  That's good.
R:  -- I am, I'm taking a little vacation while I'm -- and then my -- and then I saw this study so I thought I would do it.
L:  Yeah.  A former student of mine let me know about this --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I thought, "Ooh, ooh, I'm really low on money right now --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- I could use twenty five dollars" or whatever it is -- I forget what it is.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But it's not a million dollars and I don't --
R:  Right.
L:  -- have to not tea -- -- talk --
R:  It's not a million.
L:  -- to my best friend.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Okay, so is your best friend a registered nurse?
R:  No.
L:  No, okay.
R:  Do you want me to -- [LAUGH]
L:  No --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, it's your choice.
R:  Were you just wondering or ...?
L:  Yeah.
R:  But he is in the medical field.
L:  Uh-huh, okay.
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah, all right.
R:  But, not a nurse.
L:  No.
R:  What about you?
L:  Um, actually I think my best friend is really my ex wife --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know.  And she's remarried now --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but it's like, she knows me better than anyone else in the world, really.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, we still talk, we can --
R:  That's good.
L:  -- call each other.  She comes to visit me for my birthday and for her birthday 'cause I refuse to visit where she lives --
R:  Oh, really.
L:  -- with her new husband, yeah.  So, um -- well, it's a redefinition of friendship for me.
R:  Right.  That's interesting.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
R:  So, you wouldn't -- you wouldn't take the million dollars to just give her up?
L:  No --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I don't think so.  No, I -- you know, it's, um -- uh, at my stage in life, I'm finding that there are fewer and fewer people I can talk to who really, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- know who I am --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- and who can speak to me from an --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- intuitive understanding.  And --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I think that's really important for me to have someone who kind of -- I can talk to and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- bounce stuff off of.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  Do you know what I mean?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] That's good.
L:  Yeah, okay.
R:  Um --
L:  Have I taken over the conversation?
R:  No, that's totally okay, please do.
L:  Oh, really, okay. [LAUGH]
R:  This is my first time, is this your -- how many times have you done this work?
L:  This is the second time, but I'm --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- a college professor so I'm used to just talking.
R:  Oh, that's okay, you keep talking. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
R:  Where are you from?
L:  Wha- -- well I'm from the East Coast, I live in Philadelphia now.
R:  Okay.
L:  But, I've been up and down the East Coast --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- but I lived for a number of years in the Carolinas, for example.
R:  Okay.
L:  And so, that was in -- yeah.  No, I think -- I think I've just really gained an awful lot from friends.  It's, like, the guy who lived next door to me when I was growing up --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- from the time when I was one and a half years old --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, I'm still in touch with him, you know --
R:  That's good.
L:  -- once in a while.
R:  Mhm.
L:  There's a sort of a -- a kind of a recognition that -- that we have of each other --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Do you know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And a friend -- someone I hadn't seen for twenty eight years, who I went to college with, found my email address and emailed me --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so we've been emailing a lot and so I went out and visited -- since I had seen her last --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- she had married --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and had six children. [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.
L:  So, it was, like, wow.  And yet, despite those changes, you know, it's, like, we have a very, very good -- if anything, we have a much better friendship now --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because we have the same liking of each other --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- do you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And the same kind of real basic, uh, understanding and acceptance of each other on a deep level and at the same time we've both, like, matured and had different experiences.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, there was a lot to talk about.
R:  Wow.
L:  So, yeah.
R:  That's good.
L:  Yeah, I think it is.
R:  [SIGH] That's good.  Um --
L:  Mhm?
R:  But -- hm --
