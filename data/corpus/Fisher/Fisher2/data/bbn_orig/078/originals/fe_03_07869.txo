L:  Hi, my name is Wendy Rocket[?] and I live in Phoenix, Arizona.
R:  Hi, I'm Jason Rock[?] and I'm from New York City.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Um, wh- wh- wh- wh- what do you -- what would you like to say about time travel?
L:  Uh, I definitely think it's a, uh -- it's, uh -- it would be a good thing and, um, I think it'd be pretty exciting.  I don't know where I'd like to travel or how far back I'd like to travel but, I think, rather than travelling back and changing something in my life, I would just like to travel back through, uh, different time periods and maybe discover things that, uh, scientists or, um -- haven't been able to discover yet, or figure out things that maybe we've been trying to figure out for a long time and we're just trying to -- we're just making guesses on the subject and didn't really know, so then I could, um -- I could fill in that kind of information that was missing -- the missing link.  How about you?
R:  Um, I -- I -- I guess if I went back in time, I'd, uh -- I -- I -- I'd -- I'd -- I'd re- remember some of those -- some of those mistakes that I might have made --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, [LIPSMACK] th- tho- those mistakes that I could have furthered -- furthered, you know, uh -- c- could have made for -- made for a better -- better, uh, time, I think.
L:  Yeah, certainly.
R:  Like, uh, an old girlfriend that you spent too much time with, uh --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- or [LAUGH] -- or, um -- I don't know if I would have studied harder in my -- in school but --
L:  Yeah, I think maybe, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- well, actually in school -- in high school and stuff I -- I studied hard and didn't actually get to have as much fun as I would have liked to.  So, um -- so I definitely think in high school I -- I might have, uh, you know, tried to have been more extroverted rather than introverted --
R:  Me too.
L:  -- and stayed at home and studied. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] I wish I could say that paid off in the end but, I mean, of course when I graduated from high school it paid off but then when I went on to college, uh, you know --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- I don't know, I wish, uh -- I wish I had perhaps chosen a different college instead of just, um, following my boyfriend to the same college that he went to.
R:  Oh, yeah, well that -- that -- that's  -- you --
L:  And that's -- that's not the best answer, yeah.
R:  Yeah, that dictates a lot, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] But --
R:  I -- I would have made some different stock quotes, uh --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- st- stock, uh --
L:  Yes, certainly.
R:  -- trades I -- I -- you know.
L:  That's definitely true.
R:  I -- I -- yeah, I would -- I would time travel to before the -- the -- the -- that the, uh -- the tech fall.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] And I would se- -- I would sell those stocks --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] -- at the -- at the height.
L:  Well -- right, right.  I don't have a whole lot of regrets in my life, I figure I learned from all the mistakes that I made but, I don't know, my interests would be, you know, going back with -- through the certain time periods like the dinosaurs [NOISE] or, um you know, trying to clear up some things that maybe scientists question right now.  Uh, you know, the -- and anthropologists, they like to guess to the par- -- human life, you know, back in those time periods, so I would certainly be interested in trying to, you know, discover a way of life back then and perhaps learning from the mistakes that we made, you know --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] So, it would be --
R:  That would be great.
L:  It would be nice, yeah, [NOISE] but, um --
R:  Right, like -- like a [LIPSMACK] time travel back before Columbus ever invent- -- ever found America and -- and then --
L:  Right.
R:  -- meet the Indians oursel- -- or the -- the American Indians ourselves.
L:  Of course.  Yeah --
R:  That would be great.
L:  -- that would be great. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know how safe it would be [LAUGH] but, uh, yeah I would definitely --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- to meet some of the people from the past and learn their way of life, perhaps experience it on my own.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's always been a interest of mine.
R:  Oh, totally.  Or even --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- even just, like, uh, go back a day, right?
L:  Right, exactly, yes.
R:  E- even a week.
L:  Yeah, just yesterday, then I would have prepared better for the speech that I made in my Spanish class. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I'm a student at Arizona State University here, so ...
R:  Oh -- oh -- are -- are -- at -- at -- oh you are, huh?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh.
L:  How about you?
R:  I -- I'm a -- I'm a student at -- at FIT w- with -- a- at -- at art school.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's great.
R:  Studying, uh -- I got my -- my -- my fine arts degree --
L:  So --
R:  -- and I'm studying for t- -- and my -- my next degree's in phot- photography and globalization.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So -- so are you're trying to become a photographer?
R:  I'd like to but -- but, uh, uh, we'll see what happens but I -- I don't know, but --
L:  Right, right.  So, do you -- if you could travel back in time and meet, maybe, your favorite artist or just, you know, a person you've always wanted to meet, who would you -- who do you think you'd meet?
R:  Oh, jeeze, I -- I think I'd be an AC DC groupie.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I mean, 'cause their -- their -- their -- their -- their time has gone but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but -- but I -- but I just -- I -- I think that'd be so fun.
L:  [LAUGH] That's great. [LAUGH]
R:  They -- they -- they were my -- they were my high school idol band, you know --
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And throughout -- I think throughout high school I always liked the, um, Red Hot Chili Peppers.
R:  Oh, I liked them too, a lot.
L:  But they're still around, so ...
R:  Yeah, their -- their -- their time isn't -- isn't, uh, completely passed.
L:  Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Right [LAUGH].
R:  They're still around.
L:  So, would you -- if you could travel back in time, would you want to meet any, um, of your former family members --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- that might have passed away or --
R:  Oh -- oh, that -- that'd be great --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that -- that -- that'd be -- that'd be nice, yeah.
L:  I'd certainly like to get some -- to know some of my old family members.  I know as far back as one of my, um, great grandfathers but --
R:  Uh.
L:  -- uh, but that's as far back as I've been able to meet of my family.
R:  Uh, meet -- meet a great grandfather would be great, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So, I think that'd be another good aspect of time travel.
R:  Yeah, I -- I -- I -- I always thought that -- that I'd love to go back to -- in -- in -- in -- in time a- and -- and -- and not skip my final, uh, English exam --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- to go to a -- a Beastie Boys concert.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  'Cause I had to take the whole class again.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, really.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  A- and I always thought --
L:  Uh, that stinks.
R:  -- that -- that was so stupid.
L:  Well, see my problem with school is, I get all the way through to the end and then for some reason at the end they always have the big project deal, which I never started early enough.  So, I'm doing it at the last minute and it seems like every time, it's happened in three classes, that I don't complete that final project and therefore either I don't pass the class, or I make a grade level below what I would have made --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- by just turning in the project.  But I always seemed to be, like, three fourths of the way through the project.  I just don't ever finish it.  So, I would certainly go back and I would finish all of those projects [LAUGH] that I never finished.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [COUGH] But, you know, maybe -- allow me a failed class or just not do so well in it.
R:  Uh, totally, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] So, yeah, I'd certainly like to change -- you know, change that so I be graduate -- I probably have already been graduated if I could go back and -- and change those things.
R:  Wow, it sounds like me.
L:  [LAUGH] But, I guess that's everyone.
R:  And this -- this is, uh, funny how we got -- we got connected here because -- 'cause --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that is my situation too.
L:  Yeah.  I'm going on about, well, five years.  Ideally I'm going to graduate this summer though, so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I've got enough credits to [LAUGH] just not in quite the right areas.
R:  Uh, the same thing here, jeeze -- same thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, it's, uh -- it's -- it's -- it's gotten so jumbled around and so many classes that -- that I don't -- I don't even have a -- a, uh -- a- a specific, uh, major, it's an interdisciplinary degree now --
L:  O- oh really.
R:  -- with a -- yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  With the cont- -- with the focus on, you know, uh, globalization and photography.  Globalization, it's very general.
L:  Right, right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, how do those relate?  Globalization and photography?
R:  Uh, well it's because I -- I -- I love -- I -- I -- I li- -- I like documentary photography --
L:  Oh yeah, me too.
R:  -- and -- and I -- I enjoy anthropology just -- just like you -- like you, uh, were talking about --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, uh --
L:  That's interesting, is it an actual degree, globalization and photography?
R:  I made it up, yeah.
L:  Yeah? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it was my creation of -- of a degree.
L:  That's excellent.
R:  I created the name.
L:  [LAUGH] I've always wanted to visit New York, I still haven't been able to, I've traveled a lot, you know -- many other places around the United States, but not New York.
R:  Oh, yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah, New York's fun.
L:  [NOISE] If I could travel back in time I think I'd just like to see life actually on different continents.  I've always loved traveling --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and I always wanted to know, you know -- way of life on other -- in other cultures.
R:  Well, I -- I remember my -- my -- my time in Cambodia and Indonesia --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- and -- and --
L:  -- I spent time in Indonesia.
R:  -- I really felt like I w- -- like I did go back in time.
L:  [NOISE] No kidding --
R:  The --
L:  -- I spent a lot of time --
R:  -- maybe you actually can go back in time.
L:  [LAUGH] Indonesia was just absolutely crazy when I went there.  My brother and I we backpacked and, yeah, it definitely seemed like just, you know, [LAUGH] a whole different culture and definitely it seemed like they were backwards --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- the, uh -- the traffic there is just --
R:  I remember Sumatra, I really felt, like, I was off the edge of the earth.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] The tr- -- the traffic is just outrageous but it's funny because they don't get in that many accidents that -- I -- I think, compared to here, even though it's so backed up and crazy and they don't really have street signs and --
R:  I think it's 'cause everyone here thinks they're equal --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- on the road.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But over there they understand, they're not equal --
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  -- and -- and, you know, the big- -- the larger they are the -- the- then they're -- then they're -- then they're, um, more powerful.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You always see, like, port- --
R:  They -- they know they're not equal. [LAUGH]
L:  The motorcycle's the family vehicle down there. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah --
R:  It is scary.
L:  -- how long did you spend in Indonesia and Cambodia?
R:  Um, I -- I lived in Thailand for a year -- for over a year --
L:  Really?
R:  -- and then I --
L:  I loved Thailand that's where I visited, as well.
R:  Yeah, it was great --
