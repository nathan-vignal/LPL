R:  Hi, I'm Stephanie.
L:  Hi, I'm Darleen. [PAUSE] [MN]
R:  Oh, are we supposed to start talking now?
L:  Yeah, I think so.
R:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]  Um, how are you?
L:  Good.
R:  Good.  Um, so do you think you would commit perjury for a close friend?
L:  I don't know a close friend, maybe a relative.  But I d- --
R:  What exactly do they mean by permitting perjury do you think?
L:  Uh, like on the witness stand I suppose.
R:  Hm, okay.
L:  Um ... that's the only -- other than that there is -- it's not perjury.  I mean, I think it's only when you're under oath on --
R:  Oh, when you're under oath, okay.
L:  [MN]
R:  Um, so you would commit it for a family member but not a --
L:  I d- --
R:  -- close friend?
L:  Well, I don't know.  It ...  I just am not a very good liar and I think it's really obvious when I'm lying, so, uh --
R:  Okay.  Um, but if you were -- say you were a good liar, would you still -- do you think you would still do it?
L:  I -- I probably would.
R:  You probably would?
L:  F- for a family member.
R:  Okay.  But only a -- like an immediate family member, like a --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- parent or a sibling?  Even if you knew, um, you know, that they did something that was wrong, like even if it was like a serious c- situation, like a murder or something like that?
L:  No, I'm thinking more of like a situation like, uh, two years ago my daughter was raped.
R:  Oh goodness --
L:  A- and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- say, I don't know ...  We -- okay, eventually we found out who did it and -- and luckily there wasn't a trial because he pled guilty and -- but -- but say it came right down to it and it looked --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- like he was gonna get off, even though I knew he did it, I think that I would, I don't know, say I, m- had some information or something.  I mean, if I could do something to help my daughter to put that guy away maybe I would lie.
R:  Okay.
L:  That type of situation.
R:  So you like -- you're saying you would do it if it -- to like, uh, if the end result was that you like, were able to help out like, a family member or like --
L:  Right, but --
R:  -- make a situation all right, okay.
L:  But I don't -- I wouldn't lie for a family member who had actually done something wrong.
R:  Okay, so if you knew that like, they deserved to get the punishment that was coming to them then you wouldn't commit perjury?
L:  No, I don't think so.
R:  Okay.  That makes sense, sure.
L:  What about you?
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I'd never really thought about this before, um, but I guess, you know, it really depends, like, I mean, I would probably do pretty much anything for my parents and my brother.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, you know, my immediate family.  Um, you know, even some of my cousins who I feel like are sisters.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I th- -- I think it would definitely be situational.  Um, if it was a situation where they -- it was like a murder or, you know, something like that, then I -- I -- I would definitely have to weigh up out consequences.  I feel like for my parents or like, close family members, like I probably would in any situation, um, but I don't think I would do it for a friend.
L:  You mean if --
R:  Because anybody who, um, did something like that that was, uh, just a friend of mine, like, turns out I ne- -- they never really were my friend to begin with because I wouldn't consider somebody who would do something, you know, that horrible to be my friend in the first place.
L:  But what about the situation that I described?
R:  [LIPSMACK] If it was to right a situation then I believe that I would.  If one of my best friends were raped or something like that, like what happened to your daughter --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- um, then -- and if it w- -- if I could say -- s- -- if I could say something that would, you know, cause the culprit to pay for his crime, then yes, I would m- -- I would certainly do it.  Um, I think it's definitely situational.  I think that's a hard question to say, like, yes I would.
L:  Yeah, very hard.
R:  Or no I wouldn't, too.  Um, you know, it would definitely just depend on what was -- what was going on in the s- -- in the situation.
L:  Uh-huh, I agree.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] so I mean, if it was, you know, if it was a situation where somebody was hurt and I had the oppor- -- somebody that I was close to was hurt and I had the opportunity to b- -- to bring justice for the person who did it to them then yes, I think I would.  Um, because I -- I definitely think that, um, you know, staying true to people in my life is more important than, you know, maybe like, obeying the law.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Unless -- unless I'm hurting somebody else, you know, unless it's a situation where I'm gonna cause somebody else's child or somebody else's parent to, you know, to go through a lot of grief.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, I mean, I would definitely have to weigh the consequences of any situation though.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH] So you say you're a bad liar, do you think that that's a --
L:  Yes, I think it's written all over my face 'cause I'm the one --
R:  Right, right.  Do you think that's like, do you think that's a good thing or a bad thing in your life?
L:  I don't know, uh, fifty fifty.  Sometimes it just, you know, it's a -- a real weak point.
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  Other times it's, um, it's, you know, a part of my, uh, I would say a good virtue.
R:  Right, yeah, uh, I would agree with that.  'Cause I'm a horrible liar in the exact same way, like, I don't even bother to try.  But a lot of the times I say that that's one of my best qualities because I think that, um, you know, when you start to lie about one thing it's, you know, that whole old saying, like, what a tangled web we weave --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like [inaudible] sort of like, one lie leads to another lie and I think that you just -- and that's getting in a lotta trouble so I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- think, you know, it's better to, for the most part, to be honest and then you don't have to worry about like, the ramifications --
L:  Right, I know it.
R:  -- of what you said or did.  But, um, definitely in the case of like, perjury, um, for a family or friend, I think it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, like a whole different ball game, it's not really, um, you know, that cut or dry. [LAUGH]
L:  I wonder where -- how they come up with these topics?  I mean who --
R:  I know! [LAUGH]
L:  This is my second call.
R:  It is.
L:  And the first call was w- about weather, what did I like best, indoor or outdoor?  What -- this is for, uh, recreational activities.
R:  Oh that's interesting.
L:  And or was it --
R:  Well, at least I prefer [inaudible] to talk about.
L:  -- summer or winter, were -- did I prefer?
R:  Right. [LAUGH]  And what did you answer to that? [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know, I just --
R:  You --
L:  -- um, probably --
R:  You just talked?
L:  I think it was all indoor.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]  Well that's good.  I have had, um, what -- what's your favorite holiday?
L:  So this is your second call too?
R:  This is actually my third one because the second one I did twice.  I don't even know if you're allowed to do that but I just had nothing to do one night, so I'm like, I'll make some money.  So I was, um, call -- and so I just called a couple of people and it was like, there's just one topic a day.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So I guess that was the topic for the day. [LAUGH]
L:  How many call- -- uh, it looks like we can only participate in three, is that true?
R:  Yeah, I -- I think so, um, I was gonna call 'em to ask about that, um, because, you know, I've -- I wonder if that means like, calls that they call you, whether you can call out as much as you want, but I'm sure they -- they would have to cap you at a certain amount, um --
L:  Yeah, I mean, I have a --
R:  -- simply because you --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- could support yourself off this! [LAUGH]
L:  I know.
R:  If you wanted to. [LAUGH]
L:  I haven't called it, uh, uh, pla- you know, called them.  But then I would like to after three calls, just to see if they would let me do more.
R: Yeah, yeah, or d- -- yeah, definitely.  I was actually thinking of doing it, I think they're open from like, ten to five, I think I might call tomorrow.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So it's actually not -- it's actually not that bad, it's actually kind of an interesting way --
L:  [MN] [MN]
R:  -- to meet people [LAUGH] and talk to pe- --
L:  And then how often we -- are we supposed to get paid?
R:  Um, I think they pay you -- I think they send you a ten dollars every time you complete a call, and I think they send it to you like, they said like, up -- it could be up to six weeks after you made the call, so --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- um, I don't know.  Did you just find out about this on the Internet?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, me too. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We were just, um, scanning on Cr- -- on this website called Craig's List and we found this survey, so -- I mean, this, um, this study, so I thought it'd be interesting to do.  It's always nice to, uh, make a little bit of extra money anyways.
L:  Yeah, I -- I think I looked for, um, did a search for making money online.
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  And then that's how I found it.
R:  Right.  Do you participate in like, surveys and things like that as well?
L:  I used to but I've been passing up, like, I -- I used to do [inaudible] surveys.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, but, you know, sometimes they take forty five minutes and for a ten dollar --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- Amazon, you know, and gift certificate and I just didn't wanna devote that much time.
R:  Right, yeah, you have to weigh out whether or not it's, um, worth it to -- for what you're actually doing to get paid. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  Um, so where are you calling from?
L:  Iowa.
R:  Oh, Iowa, oh wow, okay.
L:  Where you at?
R:  [inaudible] I'm in Massachusetts.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah, I can almost tell by your accent 'cause I never knew anybody from Iowa and then I lived in California and a lot of people are out there from Iowa. [LAUGH]
L:  I have an accent?
R:  And they're sort of like, the same.  Well, I mean, I just -- maybe not like a strong accent but it's just, you know, it's -- it's -- p- people speak differently. [LAUGH]
L:  God, the last person --
R:  You [inaudible] definitely sound mid western.
L:  -- I mean, the other person I talked to was a lady who was up from out east too, so maybe they try to put m- people in the midwest and people on the coast?
R:  Yeah, maybe they do, that's interesting, to see how different people relate. [LAUGH]  [LIPSMACK]  That's very interesting.  So how did the other calls go, were they okay?
L:  It was just one, it was -- yeah, it was okay I guess.  I mean, that lady --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- was complete opposite from me.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, she was an outdoor person.  Huh.
R:  Oh okay, well that's interesting then.  Um, I think we're supposed to speak on the topic for like, at least eight minutes, so do you have anything else to say about perjury?
L:  No, I just -- no.
R:  Do -- did you have to speak on it -- does your daughter, um, did your daughter's attacker go to trial?
L:  W- no, because he ended up waiving his right to a trial because the evidence was so strong against him because they had DNA.
R:  Okay.  Well that's actually a good thing then, so she didn't have to --
L:  But --
R:  -- go through that then.
L:  Right.  Um, but there was a, you know, she got to speak at the sentencing and make a victim witness impact statement.
R:  How old is your daughter?
L:  She was twenty at the time.
R:  Okay.  [LIPSMACK] Well, that's -- well, that's good, at least, um, you know, he was willing to accept what he did and not try to fight it.
L:  I know, I'd like -- I would've -- I don't know, I would've t- taken my chances because he got twenty five years and he has to serve eighty five percent of that -- of that --
R:  But --
L:  -- sentence.
R:  Good. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I know, it's great.
R:  He deserves every [LAUGH] -- he deserves every single second of that.  Wow.  Um, have you -- had you had to participate in a trial previous or had you ever --
L:  No.
R:  -- participated in a trial before?
L:  Well, y- -- oh, I -- I guess I was in a trial a long time ago, uh, well, it was like, uh, I had a boyfriend that was stalking me.
R:  Oh God. [LAUGH]
L:  And then I had to, you know, that went to court and there was actual -- there was a jury and everything but in -- he served as his own attorney so he questioned me and that was really terrible.
R:  Wow, that must have been -- that must have been a -- a definitely challenging experience for you.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Did you, um, did you commit any perjury then or do you feel like that --
L:  No, I didn't.
R:  -- you were completely honest?
L:  And then I think I watch too many prog- TV programs because I just answered yes or no to the --
R:  Right.
L:  -- one answer -- I think there were times I should've elaborated.
R:  Right. [LAUGH]  Um, yeah, but you're not -- you -- you never know how it's gonna go, you know, when you do that, so it's probably good that you just --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, you know, stuck to the yes or no.
