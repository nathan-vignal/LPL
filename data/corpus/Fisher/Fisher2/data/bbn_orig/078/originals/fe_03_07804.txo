R:  I wanna see that.  I've seen the previews for it [inaudible] [NOISE] give that a [SIGH] [inaudible] you sorta like --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- gathered it's sorta like Big Daddy.  Like that one.  Huh.

R:  Yeah.
L:  Th- that's what I usually do if I don't like it.

R:  Oh yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  No, I've seen some of the stuff they do on TV.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that's -- that's sorta the stuff that, you know, you don't want -- see your kids to see it so you would draw the line for that kinda stuff. [NOISE]
L:  Oh yeah.  And then the kids probably --

R:  Yeah, they do.
L:  -- you know.

L:  I -- I didn't know, in this old movie where, um, Steve Martin -- and I can't remember the name of it -- he -- he was raised by a black family.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And he thought he was like black.  And then --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- they're like, "Don't trust Whitey" and then -- I mean --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- you probably today it wouldn't be c-- p- politically correct but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I kinda, you know -- I found it funny.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So --
R:  Oh, I've just seen a commercial that made me laugh but it was kinda, you know, like that [several inaudible words] again on Comedy Central they just showed this commercial for like, some shop spray laundry stick and it was in the shape of something, you know. [NOISE] [LAUGH] I'm like, "Okay". [NOISE] [LAUGH]

R:  Oh well, [several inaudible words] terrible. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, there's some crazy commercials on today.
R:  Yeah.  [MN]

R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They make 'em so crazy and far fetched that you don't even know what it's for.

L:  Yeah, that's kind of cute, I think that's like -- I don't know, that seemed like good --good humor.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's appropriate for all.
R:  I know.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] [several inaudible words].
L:  Yeah, 'cause I think, what -- what is left?  I don't know, you know.  Yeah.
R:  It's terrible, like, some of the stuff what they put on TV, it's not funny. [LAUGH]
