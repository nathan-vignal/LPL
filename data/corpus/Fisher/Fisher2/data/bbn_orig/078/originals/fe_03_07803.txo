L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, this is Carol.
R:  Hi, I'm Glenda.
L:  Hi, Glenda, where you from?
R:  I'm -- I'm actually in California but from Indiana.
L:  Oh okay, I'm in New York.
R:  Oh.  Well you're the second person I've talked to from there.
L:  This is too much fun, I love this! [LAUGH]
R:  It sounds like it. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, um, so -- sorry, I have a little bit of a cold so I sound --
L:  That's okay.
R:  -- kind of funky, but, um, okay, so unacceptable humor.  Do you have any ideas on that one?
L:  Well, I don't know how to define unacceptable.  I know what I like and I know what I don't.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, and, um, I don't particularly like things in really bad taste, um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] you know, uh, like really overtly gross sexual humor --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- doesn't -- doesn't appeal to me.  I guess I would draw the line at, you know, laughing at, um, at something violent.
R:  Yeah, there is that.  And I think of like, racial issues and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, like, I don't know, disabled people, the jokes about those.  Like all the blonde jokes, [several inaudible words] they're a whole lotta distasteful things out there --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, that people make fun of, but --
L:  But see, it depends, like, I actually think the humor about my particular ethnic group is hilarious often times, you know, and yet stereotypes and, um, I know it doesn't bother me.
R:  I don't really have any stereotypes that I'm aware of, I'm pretty basic, all American, got about thirty thousand things in me and so you can't really make fun of it kind of thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, um, I don't know, it's -- it's hard for -- for me to feel upset about people making fun of me personally 'cause --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they can't latch onto anything except maybe Irish, but, um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I don't know.  But like, I think also with the -- the, um, what's acceptable, it depends like, who's talking to you too.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Like you might be willing to accept something more from somebody you know rather than someone you don't know or the other way around.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  I don't know.  It depends on the person for me, but --
L:  Yeah.  A- and, you know, and it's hard to know too because, um, uh, I don't know, th- there was an article this past weekend in the, uh, the Sunday Times magazine --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- New York Times, uh, about this, um, muslim female comic.  And she became very -- very well know becau- -- very -- presumably because of these sort of nine eleven jokes --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that she tells.  Um, [LIPSMACK] and they're -- they're sort of oblique, you know, like one joke that she tells is, uh, "My name is -- whatever her name is, Shazia, I forget what it is -- um, at least that's what it says in my pilot's license" and, uh, this goes over really big --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- even in New York.  Um, and they described, um, one audience that she said this in front of and this guy said, "That was really uncalled for" and he walked out, and it turns out that he had lost his girlfriend --"
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- in nine eleven.  So, you know, it's -- you know, it's hard to know like, you know -- something's gonna offend everybody basically.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And what is the line you draw?  I think it's, um, it's a matter of, uh, it's a personal matter.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  Well that's why I think that you should be careful what you say in front of people, 'cause you don't know what's gonna offend them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So until you do know a person you ought to be careful about what kind of humour you're using.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Even if you may be used to it otherwise, it may not be [inaudible].
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I don't know.  I just g- -- I get really offended when people do things like about, um, under privileged like, people.  People that are in poorer like, um, social houses[?] and stuff like that, 'cause that's the people I work with and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [SIGH] you know, like, [MN] it's just -- I don't know, there's just -- there's -- you're right, there's just so much that you could be offended by --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and nobody ever knows.  So that's why it would be hard to be a comedienne I think.
L:  It would be really hard.  And, um, you know, I mean, I -- I don't like ethnic humor particularly when it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I mean, like I said, my own group I -- I kinda think it's funny.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, it depends on -- on what they say.  Some of it's really barbed and then it's not funny.  Some of it's just kinda good natured, silly stuff like, uh --
R:  Who is -- who is like, um -- how -- has it been like, friends that are making jokes or is it people that you don't know, to you?
L:  Um, b- when -- I don't know, I mean, [MN] I'm thinking -- I'm just thinking in particular of the kind of stuff that I get over the internet, you know --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- like, um ... okay, here's -- here's an example.  People tell these blonde jokes and they think it's really funny, you know, like all -- all blondes are really dumb.
R:  Are you a blonde?
L:  I'm not blonde.  Um, I have a friend who does have blonde hair and she takes great offense at these things and, you know.
R:  Yeah, I know, well -- well some blondes do, some don't, so --
L:  And she's not a ditsy blonde by any means, she's a smart woman, you know.  A- and so I'm like, "Why does it bother you?  Why do you care?" [LAUGH] you know.
R:  Yeah, really.
L:  But, uh --
R:  Like, "You know it doesn't really apply to you". [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  Um, and -- and it really bothers her.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know.  Now I'm Jewish and I think Jap[?] jokes are -- are hilarious.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I don't know if I'd think it was so hilarious if it was told by somebody who really hated Jewish women but that's never been the case.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's always been sort of a good natured ribbing [LAUGH], you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, so I don't draw the line there, I -- I think it's funny.
R:  I don't know, I'd -- I -- I took this class, um, like a month ago, and we were talking about all these negative things that we've been called before and some people might think this is funny, but some of the Asian people have been called SARS like they'll just -- like, for reason, like, people have used that as a -- a term for --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And like, and -- and the whole class was like, laughing at this 'cause they think all of these things are funny 'cause we're just going through everybody who has dealt with this, 'cause everybody in the room has had some kind of negative term thrown at them, even if you're -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, like, um, I don't know, a wop, I guess, but I mean, it's just -- people like -- for instance we were all like, laughing at these but it's really not funny when you think about it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.
L:  I get uncomfortable with, uh, there was a whole spate of jokes when I was a -- a teenager.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, about people with no arms and legs, things like that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, and I -- I could never quite feel good about laughing at them.
R:  I know.  I have an aunt that doesn't have one of her legs and I'm like, "Why is that funny again?"
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's just -- [MN] 'cause I think once you've experienced it, it makes it so much less amusing to you personally. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  So everybody can joke about something they never felt or done, so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that's much easier.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  But -- but, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know, there -- I just -- I don't really know what [NOISE] -- I don't really know [NOISE] -- just a moment.  Shush.  Um, [LIPSMACK] let's see, what else was the [inaudible] social?  You know, personally, like, um, what -- what did you say when we first started?  Like, sexual humor?
L:  Yeah, like gross sexual humor.
R:  Gross sexual humor.  I -- I -- that's defined differently for everybody also, so, um, I -- I personally am like, twenty three years old and that's something that when you're in college everybody makes jokes about stuff like that and it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- very funny.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, so that's one area that I'm really okay with because it's just so common for me, so once you get kind of immune to it you can take anything.  Like, I said, um, [LIPSMACK] watching something violent and laughing at it, that's not something I would do but I --
L:  I can't do that.
R:  -- you know --
L:  I can't go there.
R:  -- kids that are watching TV all the time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they see it all the time, they watch shows like Jackass [MN] --
L:  That is really --
R:  You've heard of that show?
L:  Yeah, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I just don't find it funny.  I -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Again I wouldn't draw the line because if somebody else thinks it's funny it's not my business, you know.
R:  Right, right.
L:  It's stupid but --
R:  It is stupid.  [LAUGH]  That's my opinion but I mean, some people think this is really cool and funny and it's just interesting to watch.  They're so amused that somebody else would be willing to do that to themselves --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just so that, you know, they can be watched and thought of as cool or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- something, I don't know.  Um, but that, I think that that's crossing the line 'cause [MN] people kind of, um, or young people might idolize that --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and wanna do that too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] Well, kids are just, I don't know, kids just do silly things sometimes.
L:  They do.
R:  So, you never know.
L:  I guess w- you know, we did too. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I know, uh, adults aren't any better but you just, I don't know, I -- I worry about kids 'cause they're just exposed to so much more than I was even, and I'm still pretty young.  But I listen to the things that they do and I hear the things that they hear and I'm like, "Oh gosh, they're just gonna fall for anything".  So, um, that's why I think that humor is not good for them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But how do you --
L:  Well, d- it desensitizes people I think.
R:  Right.  So how do you keep them from that?
L:  [SIGH] I don't think you can but I think what you can do is, is, um, you know, just educate people --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know.  Um, you can't censor the world, we live in a free country.
R:  Right.
L:  Kids are gonna hear what they hear and, you know, as -- as, uh, somebody who's been around the block a few times you could say, you know, "I can understand why you'd think that's funny but here's --"
R:  [MN]
L:  "-- why I think it's, uh, it's important --"
R:  No.
L:  "-- what I think it's important to keep in mind, you know, and then see if you really think it is funny".
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, I agree.  I just think that they don't do enough of that.  They don't do enough of the educating along with the -- the humor side to it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  Well, I think -- I think schools are trying to do more of that, more kinda like diversity awareness and that sort of thing.
R:  I don't know.  I work at a inner city school and I don't feel like they are.  I -- there's still a lotta gang situations and people that don't understand each others' cultures.  You may get called a Dirty Mexican and they accept that now.
L:  Mm.
R:  They don't even like, get phased by it.  If you're a Mexican [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that doesn't hit you, so ...
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, and it's like black cl- -- kids call each other Nigger.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I have a real hard time with that.  I understand they're doing it as a way --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- of desensitizing but I think it's not that [MN] -- that good an idea, to desensitize people --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to these things, you know.
R:  [LIPSMACK] I agree.
L:  Instead, say, "Hey, that's not my name", you know?
R:  Mhm.  I know, I wish they would do that but they don't.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I've heard some of my kids do that and I just don't know what to say to them 'cause it's been so ingrained in them that they don't even listen to me anymore even though I'm their teacher.  They -- they're like --
L:  Yeah, "And what do you know, white kid?" you know! [LAUGH]
R:  Sh- I'm a white teacher, whatever.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So I -- I don't know
