R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, my name's Paula.
L:  Hi, I'm Anne Jeanette.
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  All right. [LAUGH]
R:  Where'd you sign up from?
L:  Um, Charlotte.
R:  Okay. [LAUGH]
L:  What about you?
R:  Um, on the Web there was a post on there.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  On -- on one of the websites --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I go on.
L:  Okay.
R:  So it said to, uh --
L:  This is my first one too.
R:  Me too! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I got a phone call the other day and my husband answered it and he hung up.  He said, "That must be some crazy thing you signed up for" [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, okay.  And me -- this is my first and I'm like, "Okay, I think this is it, bam". [NOISE]
R:  I called -- the other day they called me [NOISE] --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- and, um, and -- well, I called in and used the PIN number but I was on hold for like, uh, quite a while.
L:  Me too.
R:  Right!  It was --
L:  So I never -- I hung up and I said, "Well I don't know if this thing is legit".
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Okay --
R:  S- --
L:  -- so we're supposed to talk about perjury? [LAUGH]
R:  Right, would you commit perjury for a family --
L:  I don't think so.
R:  No, me neither be- --
L:  Not with this -- not with this stuff going on in America these days.
R:  Are you kidding? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I don't even --
R:  And what --
L:  -- think I would even try to tell a little lie.
R:  And there'd be --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- two people [NOISE] in prison besides [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, 'cause they're gonna take you and then your family and every- --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- everybody else, so --
R:  And you know what?  Today they find out everything anyway.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I mean, eventually everything all comes out and --
L:  Once they arrest you anyways, they done and -- they done got everything, you know.
R:  Ain't that the truth. [LAUGH]
L:  By the time you get to jail then they have your family history.
R:  There you go.  And then you're worried half the time if they -- if you do get you for something --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that you didn't do it and --
L:  And even if, you know, you went to school, high school or something, you know, y- -- and then, you know, women are paranoid.
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  So I'll be like, [several inaudible words] and called my high school teacher and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- she told 'em I just called cheating.  Oh my goodness.  Lord -- 'cause the other day I think it was the topic of illness.  Well that's when I called in but it took forever for somebody to come on, so I hung up.
R:  Right.  I -- it was pets and I thought, "Oh, that's a good one, so let me wait" and I was waiting and --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- waiting, and then of course I have two small children --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so I thought--
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- "Okay, I can't really wait too --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- long". [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And see, I have twins too.
R:  Oh.  Oh wow, how old?
L:  They'll be two next month.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  A boy and a girl, so ...
R:  Okay, I have an eighteen month old and a three year old, so --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- almost close to twins, right?  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  I know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Man!
R:  But it does scare you, a lotta times on the news you see now where they're letting all these people go because they find out they're g- -- they're not guilty now --
L:  Yeah, towards the end.
R:  -- and they spent all that time in jail.
L:  But it's like when -- when people go to, um, like, go to p- -- to jail and then the whole process, it like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- takes like, five years.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then it's like, they [inaudible] they commit for ten years, so five years they're back and forth into the courts and stuff and then the commit 'em for ten and then find out they didn't do it.  So it's like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- what are they doing?
R:  Right, right.  And you can't get that time back, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- after that.
L:  You can't get it, because my first thing would be trying to sue America.
R:  There you go! [LAUGH]
L:  You know.  But you could never get no money! [LAUGH]
R:  Right, no matter how much money you got you just missed too much though.
L:  Because they're gonna keep taking you back and for- -- yeah, they're gonna keep --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- taking you back and +forth into the courts and, you know, 'cause even on like, The Practice, that's my show, so --
R:  Oh, me too! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And why did they move from Sundays?  I do not know.
R:  Do you know, I can't believe that the -- the --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- lead guy is leaving.
L:  Did you hear that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a- half of the cast is going.
R:  Really?
L:  Half of the cast is going.  I think the only people that are staying is -- is Eugene and like one of the off- ladies.
R:  He's like, one of the best though.
L:  I know, Eugene is a trip, 'cause when he gets upset, oh my goodness! [LAUGH]
R:  He was on, um, Rosie O'Donald one day.
L:  [NOISE] Oh Lord.
R:  And he was so good.  I think he used to be like, um, a telephone lines person or something.
L:  No, no!
R:  Like, I mean, he wasn't even --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- acting and he jus thought, "Oh, let me try out for this" and they hired him.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  'Cause he seems like he's been doing it for a while.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Huh, I didn't know they were all leaving.
L:  Yeah.  They said they, um, the show was costing 'em too much money.
R:  Wow.
L:  And I guess either they bumped it down, and you know Bobby was not even trying to hear it. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  But mostly everybody on the cast is leaving, only like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- two or three people gonna be there.
R:  Wow.  I wonder if it'll be as good?
L:  I hope so.
R:  Well that's like Law and Order --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that's been on forever but it's constantly new people --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- over and over and over.
L:  Yeah, 'cause Law and Order kinda just takes off from where it happens.
R:  Right.
L:  See, Practice runs on, you know, you gotta see the first one to see the next one. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.  Which is kinda good.  But when they moved it to Mondays I was like, "What are they doing?"
R:  Huh.  That --
L:  'Cause there was so much stuff already on Monday.
R:  Right, and that --
L:  But do you see, now they're moving it back?
R:  That's the, um, The Alias --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I hate to miss that too, that's good.
L:  Yeah, I hear that's good but I could --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- never get into that.
R:  Now, a lotta people say that but I think that's one of the best shows out, once you start watching it.
L:  I saw this -- I saw the [NOISE] -- I think the very first episode and then I was like, "What the hell?" [NOISE]
R:  Right. [LAUGH]  It is hard to follow sometimes. [LAUGH]
L:  You know.  And then that was my last -- it was always like, "What in the worl- -- okay, she jumped" and then I saw another one and I was like, "Okay --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- what is this?  I spy -- okay, this ain't gonna work!" [LAUGH]
R:  No. [LAUGH]
L:  And I was like, "I don't know why they took off my Practice" 'cause at ten o'clock I was -- I'd be ready for The Practice, me and my husband.
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  'Cause you know, men don't care for TV.
R:  Right.
L:  But he was watching The Practice.
R:  My husband gets up for work at like, one --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in the morning, so we -- he tapes all the shows all week long, so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- we watch --
L:  Do he watch 'em?
R:  Yeah.
L:  All right.
R:  Yeah, he likes 'em but that's the one -- he w- -- he won't miss The Practice neither, that's the one --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we always try and get.  Like a lotta times we get so many tapes piled up --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that we can't possibly --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- watch 'em all.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But we make sure we watch that anyway.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.  [NOISE]  Well, okay, I guess what -- so, [LAUGH] --
R:  I think you're supposed to wait --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- until it beeps and that's like, ten minutes.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.
R:  And then I guess you have to punch --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- something in?  I don't know.
L:  [NOISE] I hope not --
R:  I'm --
L:  -- 'cause I don't have my PIN.
R:  No, no -- well, no, the PIN, you only need it when you --
L:  Oh, when you dial in?
R:  -- just call in, I think.  So I guess since they called our --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- phone number they know --
L:  Okay, cool, cool.
R:  -- they know, uh, who we are and hopefully --
L:  Yeah, 'cause the --
R:  -- the check will come anyhow.  But I thought ten bucks --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- for ten minutes, heck, you can't beat that! [LAUGH]
L:  You know, after I did it I said, "Ten minutes, that's kinda long!" [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I was just sitting here thinking that when, uh -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- when the phone rang [LAUGH], it's like --
L:  And then when it ca- -- 'cause it's just -- it's a recording. [NOISE] 
R:  Right.
L:  And when I picked up it was already halfway through and it [MN] -- when I picked up it was saying, "Do you wanna accept the call?" and I'm like, "Is somebody calling me collect?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know.  So I'm just listening to it and I said, "Okay, that must be the -- okay, that must be the people".
R:  Yeah.
L:  But it said on the thing that it'll be a eight hundred number that pops up on my caller ID.
R:  Oh really?
L:  But it's not a eight hundred number, it's a number from Philadelphia. [NOISE]
R:  Huh.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Well, isn't it u- -- isn't it through University of Penn?  That -- maybe that's why, 'cause university obviously is in Pennsylvania, so --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- that'd be two one five.
L:  'Cause I -- and I've been seeing that number on my caller ID and I'm like, "Who keeps calling me from Philadelphia?"
R:  Huh.
L:  The people said one eight hundred, you know.
R:  R- where are you from?
L:  I'm f- -- I'm in Charlotte.
R:  Okay, I'm in, uh, we're in Warrington, which isn't far from Philadelphia, it's like right outside Philadelphia.
L:  So is yours coming up?  Or do you have a --
R:  I -- we don't even have a caller ID because I'm too cheap to pay for it! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Girl, I live by caller ID.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That what they should call of 'em -- that should be a topic is, whoa!
R:  And th- [LAUGH] --
L:  That's what I look, you know, I picked it up but it was in the middle of the call and I'm --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it doesn't start over again.  I said, "Well, let me just --" it sounded like it was so I accepted it and then it said, "Wait, we'll find another caller", I said, "Okay, that gotta be it".
R:  Right.
L:  'Cause when I called in, I called in after two and it took forever and I'm like, "Okay, stay at home moms, where y'all at?"
R:  Right, same with me.  I called it like [NOISE] -- I think it was like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- eleven o'clock or something, so I would figure, I guess everybody that called --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- was probably at work or something.
L:  Oh, okay.  'Cause my thing said that you can't call in till --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- after two.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, maybe that's why then! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It wasn't even going on then.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But it said, "Hold and wait for a caller".  I was holding for like, fifteen minutes and I thought, "Okay, I don't think it should take this long".
L:  And that's how I did it.  I think it's -- my -- my email said, "Call after two".
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So I was like, "Okay".  And then after I called and they had me on the line I was like, "This is -- this is not legit, whatever" and hung [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.  Well, I, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  The kids go down for their nap at eleven, so I thought, "Oh, this is perfect, they're both napping, I won't have to worry about it" but my husband's home now and they're trying to keep them a little bit calm --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, okay, yeah, see my kids, they're p- they're playing.
R:  -- I figured --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- let me -- let me run in the other room and hide! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] Yeah, they ain't gonna miss -- by the time they come and they're [inaudible] it's like, "Okay, it's almost over".
R:  So how do you make -- how do you make out with your twins?
L:  Oh, I do real good.
R:  Good.
L:  I do real good.
R:  It's tough, I'm sure, though, now?
L:  No, now is easy.
R:  Yeah?
L:  It's only rough the first three months.
R:  Yeah?  Well that's good.
L:  Once they little.  Once they, you know, 'cause you got -- they got down different schedules and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, you're trying to put 'em to sleep and when one wake up you running try to get that one --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so that one don't wake up the other, and then sometimes it's go one wake up and then the other one wake up, so it's like you're going, going, going. [NOISE]
R:  I cannot even imagine.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] My husband keeps --
L:  But now they fine and, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they play together good and they share and everything so they got all the good concept down.
R:  That is good with them being so close in age because they do love the heck out of one another.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, I mean, they do fight a lot but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, they're -- th- --
L:  And it's a boy and a girl so they kinda wrestle, so you know --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- the girl's gonna be bossy.
R:  Right! [LAUGH]
L:  The boy is just gonna be like, "Fine, whatever you want me to do".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] All right, that's pretty much --
R:  I got two girls, so --
L:  That's pretty much the way they go too.
R:  That's good.
L:  They be like, "Come on, come" you know, and he just be looking at her like, and she be, "Come on!"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'll be like, Lord, she is gonna be -- yes, that's my daughter --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- mhm.
R:  Well, I mean, so any more or no, you're done now?
L:  I think I'm gonna have one more.
R:  Yeah, my husband keeps saying, "What do you think, shall we have another?" and I'm like --
L:  But it's like, I was laid off from my job, so it's like --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I don't know right now.
R:  Right.  I kn- --
L:  I w- -- I'm looking and I'm working part time here and there, well temping rather --
R:  Right.
L:  -- here and there, but once I actually find something, you know, full time and been on it for about at least six months there we might go through the process.
R:  Right.
L:  Or at least pay some of these damn bills off, oh, I'm like --
R:  I hear ya. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I'm just sick of them [inaudible], I just wanna call everybody and tell them, "Don't send me anything".
R:  [LAUGH] We just, uh --
L:  Oh!
R:  I just started work, I'm part time --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just so we can try and get a lot of our loans paid off because it'd be great if before we had another one all that was taken care of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then we --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- wouldn't have to worry about it.
L:  It's like, oh my [NOISE] -- after a while it get on your +nerve!
R:  I hear ya! [LAUGH]
L:  But, you know, I pay a lot of m- -- we pay a lotta our stuff through the, um, computer.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, my mom does that too but --
L:  I do the, um, I go to My -- My Check Fee dot com.
R:  Huh.
L:  It's free.
R:  And then -- then they automatically, what do you, just deposit --
L:  You --
R:  -- money there and they send --
L:  Well they don't have every bill -- no, it's just like you doing, say if you wanna pay online?
R:  Right.
L:  It's just you set up all your b- -- um, banking information and they have your bills, like say if you were Best Buy, if they had Best Buy on there, you just put your information in and they'll send you a E. bill.
R:  Huh.
L:  And you just submit how much you wanna pay.  So if you wanna pay it next Thursday, you set it up to pay next Thursday and it'll automatically come out.
R:  [NOISE] Huh.
L:  So it's like, uh, it's -- it's just so funny now 'cause it's like we hardly get any darn bills in the mail and I'm like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- okay [LAUGH] you know [NOISE] 'cause and the stamps keep going up.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, so I'm like --
R:  I hear ya.
L:  -- well fine.  So we just, you know, I just set it up
