L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello, how are you?
R:  Fine, thank --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you.
L:  What's [NOISE] your name?
R:  My --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- name's Greg but -- well, Frank -- I go by Frank and I'm from Pittsburgh.
L:  Oh, my name's Kristen and I'm from [NOISE] St. Petersburg, [NOISE] Florida.
R:  Uh, you calling from a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- cellphone?
L:  Yeah, oh no, I'm on a, um, [NOISE] cordless phone. [NOISE]
R:  What kind?
L:  A cordless phone.
R:  Okay, okay. [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Get -- it's getting some inter- interference that's why I -- I mention it.
L:  Right.
R:  Had to wait twenty minutes to get hooked up --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm going to do this at two o'clock every day 'cause you get to be hooked up quicker if -- at -- at two than you do at four or five.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Did you have to wait twenty minutes?
L:  [NOISE] Uh, just now?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh no, [NOISE] I called and you got right on, I didn't even have to wait at all.  But earlier --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I tried calling and I waited on here almost twenty minutes before anybody got through --
R:  Okay, same thing.
L:  -- and I just ended up hanging up the phone, so [LAUGH] --
R:  We're supposed to stay on the subject or we don't get paid, so --
L:  Oh, yeah, okay.
R:  So, what is it, if we had an opportunity to go back in time?
L:  Where -- where would we go and why and what would we change or something like that, yeah.
R:  Yeah, would you -- if you had the opportunity to change something, would you and why and [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, uh -- well if -- if I was able to travel back in time, which I think is possible right now.  With a telescope, we can see stars a hundred and eighty million light years away.
L:  Right.
R:  But if I could really do it, [SIGH] I don't know, and, uh, those -- I would freak those people out --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- unless they were -- unless they were informed.  And if they were informed that would mean the past would be changed and therefore -- if -- my future would be changed.
L:  Right.
R:  Of course the idea is to change me anyway, so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so, what's the goal am -- am I going to change me?  That means I should work now to change me. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  But, [LIPSMACK] would I go back and see people who are dead and things like that?  I don't think so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because I'd -- they would die all over again for me and it would be sad all over again --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- like old -- old girlfriends -- things like that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that tore my heart out, I -- [LAUGH] I don't think I want that.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] They'd tear it out all over again --
L:  Right.
R:  -- 'cause I think you'd have the same dynamic with the same people.  I don't know, I -- there's a lot there and the question is; would I change a lot of things in my life?  You bet I would.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, me too. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Oh, would I change a lot of things?  If I push the button, let's say I was able to erase everything, uh, [SIGH] I would, like, selectively -- like to erase some things.
L:  Right.
R:  But, uh, what would that do to f- -- the rest of everything else?
L:  [MN]
R:  And I'm a believer -- there is no free will, so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that's kind of a sad thing to preach, but I kind of believe that. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We don't have much free will --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's pretty limited [LIPSMACK] 'cause I think what we create is what we -- what we, uh, reap we sow.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, [SIGH] what do you think?
L:  Well --
R:  Would you like to do it -- just -- I want to listen to you and see what you have to say.
L:  I don't really know, um, I guess --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I guess I would go back -- is this, like, to a point in your life, or just, like, periods -- just, like, you can go back back or --
R:  I think they meant you -- for you and --
L:  -- personally in your life --
R:  -- something personal, they want to know something personal that you would change and why and would there be something specific that you did.
L:  All right, let's see --
R:  Let's say, uh, you stole something or --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- or you -- you don't know me, you could tell me if you stole it, we all stole something in our life --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- haven't you?
L:  Yeah --
R:  A pen --
L:  -- I guess, you know, a  candy when we were little and stuff I'm sure.
R:  A relationship, would you -- would you, uh, not have a relationship you had at one time?
L:  No, I think I would go back [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, to when I actually moved out of Florida and, um, I thought, like, I had to get away from Florida for a while, so I --
R:  Right.
L:  -- moved up to Tennessee [LIPSMACK] and I ended up losing the guy I probably should have spent the rest of my life with --
R:  Uh.
L:  -- and -- and I -- and I was actually pregnant when I left and I had a miscarriage --
R:  Uh-oh.
L:  -- and I lost the baby and I never saw him again and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- he hates me 'til this day.  So, that'd probably be where I'd go back to because he was --
R:  Tennessee?
L:  No, back to not going to Tennessee, [LAUGH] I would choose not to go --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- 'cause it ruined my life, I'm miss him still -- eleven[?] years --
R:  So, you left somebody in Flo- -- you left somebody in Florida you shouldn't have?
L:  Yes, yes.
R:  In your opinion?
L:  Yes --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I know so.
R:  How do you know?
L:  Because it's -- I just do, [LAUGH] he was the one.
R:  How do you know?
L:  I just --
R:  You don't know for sure, do you?
L:  I guess --
R:  No, I'm not being --
L:  -- nobody knows for sure but I -- that's the way I feel --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in my mind and in my heart and everything, I feel, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- he was the one I was supposed to be with and I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- stuffed it all up by moving away. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That's how I feel.
R:  Well, I had a -- I had a -- I'm older than you so I had -- I had a girlfriend I -- when I was your age -- I don't know how old you are -- round about -- uh, you know, mm -- I'm a musician and all that, but I'm older [MN] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I had a girlfriend when I was about twenty five -- virginal, all that stuff and I -- I left her and, uh, came back -- uh, lived my life.  Twenty eight years later she contacts me --
L:  Wow.
R:  Oh, man, this has been the most painful thing in my life --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, thi- this bookend thing and I always thought this was so wonderful and she told me all these little thing -- +tidbits about how she went out with my friend and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- she just tore my mind up.
L:  That's horrible. [LAUGH]
R:  And she liked -- I mean, she -- and she's just being -- in the name of being honest, so it's -- so in a way, that's kind of like traveling in time because I'm -- I'm able to travel mentally back to the things my friend, who was so close to me all this time -- she didn't have a clue we'd been in contact all this time, me and friend.
L:  Right.
R:  But we -- you know, men are, uh, kind of in competition in this kind of stuff, you know, and, uh --
L:  Well, that's right.
R:  -- he was a famous basketball player and I wasn't, I'm a musician.  Well, that's okay, but you don't look at those things, you look at the things you're not, not what you, uh, you know, uh, you know -- I have -- I'm very sensitive so she could break --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [NOISE] for -- for months we were on the telephone, we're on the internet, we're -- [MN], she wants to meet me, she wants to marry me, and [LAUGH] -- and, you know, it's all about money. [LIPSMACK]
L:  Mhm.
L:  And I know, I -- you know, like you say, you know it's for you, but let me tell you, honey, from this old man's point of view --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- uh-uh --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, I know you feel this way but it [LIPSMACK] -- what you dream and what actually happens -- man, you uncover everything and look at -- look at every rock. And I -- I had the most romantic ti- time in my life back then with her.  But when you turn up all the rocks it ain't pretty --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it ain't pretty.  You know, I -- I had the opportunity to see it, I think it was kind of a gift.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It was ego crushing -- ego crushing, and that's part of life.  Humiliation, all kinds of stuff, we got into all kinds of discussions you wouldn't believe.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, you would believe, you know.  And, you know, I'm -- I'm very inquisitive and I talk like crazy and [LIPSMACK] -- and so i- in a way I was able to tra- travel back in time so I w- -- I w- -- yes, I would want to be a better person, I would want to change things about myself and do things -- you know, all the -- see all the women I had sex with, let's say?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I would erase them.
L:  All of them?
R:  Ev one -- every one of them.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'd be a virgin and start right now --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and I'm fifty five.  Why?  They haunt me.  I don't want to be haunted by them.  They're like ghosts, you know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't want those ghosts in my mind, it makes me want -- run after other women and then I -- I -- more and more and more, it's like putting gasoline on a fire [NOISE] and so, you know, and I'm an emotional mo- -- uh, a musician and I play in New York and Chicago and all over -- that's why I'm doing this on the phone, 'cause I just don't have anything better to do and I make --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a couple of bucks.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] So, uh [SIGH] -- yeah, if I -- if I could push a button or travel back and do it -- it may take some work [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  That would require all kind of, uh, spider web stuff.  You know, you'd get caught all over you like the tar baby --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, I don't know, I --I -- you -- but I would definitely change -- I've said this over and over again -- I, uh, to -- to people that -- young people, you know.  "Oh, man, this is fun, I like this, this is, uh, sensual and good", I said, "Well, I'll tell you what, buddy, you wait 'til later --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- all these things are -- they come at you and it causes you to do more of this stuff -- more and more and more".
L:  Mm.
R:  You know, not always, you know, and then you're always looking for your soul mate [LAUGH] whoever the hell that is --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and sometimes you find some kind of connection.  I don't think anybody finds one of them --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know.  There might be one or two people that [LIPSMACK] [LAUGH] -- you know, so, um --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- relationships are one thing and I'd go back and see my family and be able to view them without them knowing, I'd like to do that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like a movie -- like a movie.
L:  Right, that'd be cool --
R:  That'd be cool.
L:  -- I'd like to do that.
R:  Uh, I think that'd be possible some --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- day, I think you're able to do it like a movie because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, just like you can see a planet --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- but I -- I wouldn't like to go back and interfere with them because they'd look at me like I was nuts, "Who are you?"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "Boy, you look ugly, who are you?" [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] "You're not my child".
R:  "Where do you come from?  What's -- what's your name?  You say you're me?"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "Get out of my house". [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  You know -- and, you know, I'm -- but I'm going back and confront my- myself as a little boy?  That kid has his right to be there --
L:  Right.
R:  So, what am I -- when what right do I have?  And then see my dad and my mother and my grandmother and my grandfather -- I have a grandfather alive, believe it or not --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- oh, man, he's a hundred -- has a hundred and two year -- three year old girlfriend --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and, uh, [SIGH] I don't want to live that long.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, getting old can be a curse, you know. [NOISE]
L:  Right, that's true, they -- they say that.
R:  Yeah, we'll all fall over in our pea soup some day and gurgle .
L:  Ugh. [NOISE]
R:  But, uh, when I --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Just a matter of when and how.  But, you know, uh, li- life's -- life's wonderful, life's a go- -- human life's like a bubble in the wind and that's the way I look at it and that beam of light that comes off the University of Pittsburgh right now -- I'm seeing that beam of light that happened maybe thirty sec -- or a second or so ago.  So, I'm really seeing it in the past and that way, as I take a step I'm walking through time.  Every moment we live --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the past is here --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and -- and we weave the future, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- with our past actions -- present, you know.  So, what do you think, would you -- would you just like to wa- watch everything, would you like to go back and -- wouldn't it make you melancholy though to see all those things?  As you get older you would, you know, you miss those people that have died.  You probably haven't experienced much death -- death in your life yet?
L:  Well, I've had people die. [LAUGH]
R:  You sound like you're about twenty, twenty one, like, that?
L:  Somewhere near that, hm.
R:  Close?
L:  A woman never tells her age.
R:  Okay, mm.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  How coy. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  No, but -- I don't know, I would like to, um -- I'd like to -- some -- some people I'd like to go back and have, like, a one on one thing with, like, somebody that has died or something --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'd just like to go back and -- and see just -- and spend a cou- -- a little more time with them than I -- you know, never --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- got to say goodbye to or whatever.
R:  Yeah.  Wouldn't it be painful though to leave them again or would you --
L:  Yes, I --
R:  -- be --
L:  -- yeah, --
R:  uh, maybe want --
L:  -- it would, but I -- I would feel better knowing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that I got to say goodbye to them than have them just die and have me --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- not say everything I had --
