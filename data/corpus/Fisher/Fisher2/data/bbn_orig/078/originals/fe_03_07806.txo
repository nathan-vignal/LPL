L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hi.  
L:  Hi.  My name is Bo.
R:  Hi.  My name is Deborah.
L:  How are you?
R:  I'm fine.  Uh, where are you from?
L:  I'm from L.A.
R:  Los Angeles?
L:  Yes, and you?
R:  I'm from, um, Nanimo[?] which is on Vancouver Island.
L:  Okay.
R:  Up by Victoria in Vancouver?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, so what do you do?
L:  Um, I don't -- I'm a [MN] a student so I'm --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in school right now.  Uh --
R:  Like college or university?
L:  Yeah.  University of Pennsylvania.
R:  Oh, neat.  
L:  And you?
R:  What are you taking?
L:  I'm a psyche major.
R:  Oh, neat.  My hu- my husband's a psychologist.  
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  [COUGH]  I'm a teacher and I've taken a lot of psychology too.
L:  Okay.  I want to be a teacher actually.
R:  Do you?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, it's a tough job.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  I know.
R:  It's getting -- it's not getting any easier 'cause people don't want to spend money.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Public money on pe- -- on kids.  
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  And so the classes are bigger and it's harder --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to get what you need but anyway ...  Well, good luck to you.
L:  Thank you.
R:  Um, I figured I'd -- I'm just a substitute teacher right now 'cause I moved districts.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And so I thought well forty bucks --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- or thirty bucks is thirty bucks.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  And I'm --
R:  So.
L:  -- just sitting around taking classes so I figured I can talk on the phone.
R:  Sure, why not?
L:  You know.
R:  Um, so we're supposed to talk about what's acceptable humor and how do you draw the line --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- between acceptable and unacceptable --
L:  Really?
R:  -- humor.
L:  They told me the [LAUGH] topic was whether I would commit perjury for a close friend or family member.
R:  Oh.  Okay.
L:  So, whichever one you'd like to talk about.  
R:  Well, comedy's probably easier to talk about.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  
R:  What do you think?
L:  Um, well I -- I don't know.  I feel like joking about things makes -- makes certain topics easier to deal with.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Um, and I just -- I don't know.  I don't really find a lot of things offensive to me personally.
R:  Well, I think --
L:  Because --
R:  -- it's -- sorry.
L:  Well, I was just saying I don't -- I don't know a whole lot of people that actually fit most of the stereotypes that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- there are.  So I'm not really offended by a lot of jokes.
R:  Well, I think a good example might be nine eleven.  
L:  Oh.
R:  I mean, there were so many jokes flying around after nine eleven.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And there were some people who -- who was saying how could you tell that?  How could you -- you know, how could you laugh?  That's horrible.  Think of the people that died.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, I mean, I asked my husband about it because he is a psychologist --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and he said it's a stress reliever.  It's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- one way that people cope.
L:  It's -- it's probably the most popular way of coping.
R:  Yeah.
L:  As far as I know is --you know, joking about it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, and --
R:  I think I'm like you too.  Is, uh -- there's not much I find offensive.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because it is a joke.
L:  Right.
R:  You know --
L:  And --
R:  -- like I --
L:  As long as I know that it's a joke --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and as long as that's how it's being said then I don't really find a whole lot offensive.
R:  Yeah.  Some of the funniest jokes that I've ever been told have been from the people who fit the stereotype.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  You know I, um, when I was a kid I babysat for a Jewish family --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I, you know, was their babysitter and their summer helper for, like, nine years.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And some of the funniest Jewish jokes I heard were from the man himself.  [LAUGH]  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know he'd -- he'd tell me all sorts of funny ones.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you know it's --
L:  I don't know.  It -- it's -- a lot of people are sensitive --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for no reason.  But --
R:  I --
L:  -- uh --
R:  I think a lot d- depends on your age too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like things I found funnier when I was in college I don't find quite --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- as funny now.
L:  There's --
R:  I [MN] --
L:  Yeah, there -- there are a lot of things that my friends and I find comical and older people, like my brother or my parents don't find too funny.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  But, you know, just --
R:  Well, I'm just about forty and I -- I still have a pretty good sense of humor but I used to worship David Letterman.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Like, I mean, I would watch him religiously every --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- single night.  You know, I'd make sure that I stayed up or I taped it.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And now, you know, if I catch it once in a while, about -- I'd -- I'd say about maybe sixty percent of the stuff I find really funny.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And the other forty percent I just go [MN] that's just dumb. [LAUGH] 
L:  That's --
R:  You know.
L:  That's funny that you chose David Letterman 'cause I'm kind of the same way with him. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I used to stay up.  Uh, my dad used to watch it all the time so I would stay up with him and watch it.  
R:  Right.
L:  And now when I catch it I'm like [MN] like the top ten.  Sometimes it's funny.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Sometimes it's just, like, okay, you gotta --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- come up with something different than that.
R:  Yeah.  This guy's just too full of himself.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, uh --
L:  But --
R:  It's a -- yeah, I think it's an age thing.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, but, I mean, there's -- there's tasteless and there's tasteless.  I mean, there's -- there's so many degrees of -- of tastelessness and, um, I --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- don't know.  I've -- I haven't ever really heard much that just, you know, made me angry at the person or -- for --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- telling it. 
L:  Yeah.  I've never -- I've never heard a joke.  I'm -- I'm African American and I've heard a lot of racist jokes about African Americans.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I've never actually heard a joke that I knew was being told as a joke --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that I found offensive.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Just because --
R:  And yet a lot of people would.  You know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- really take offense.
L:  And I -- I don't take offense because I know that it's being said as a joke.
R:  Right.
L:  And, for the most part, the people that are saying it are African Americans also.
R:  Right.
L:  So I know that they're not being completely serious when they say it, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  In Canada there's not really, um, there aren't really a lot of African American people.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- so there isn't -- there -- [MN] you don't really hear African American jokes.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I think -- I think we have a little bit of a different idea --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- about racism.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, it's not such a big issue here.  It's like Canada's just this big huge melting pot of [SIGH] you know, people from everywhere.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And nobody really cares.
L:  Yeah, um --
R:  You know, it's --
L:  I think that here a lot of it has to do wi- -- well, in -- it started out because, you know, jobs were being taken --
R:  Right.
L:  -- by certain minority groups and that's --
R:  Affirmative action?
L:  Yeah.  And --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- I don't know, I think that's where people started becoming angry when it started messing with their --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, means of making money.
R:  We have a bit of that with the native population.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, about three percent of Canada's population is native.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they're starting to see some of that.  There was just something in the news now where there was a -- a government job posted and it said you need not apply if you're not, you know, a visible minority.  
L:  Oh, really?
R:  You know, presumably native.
L:  Hm.
R:  And, uh, 'cause it had something to do with the native fishery or something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, people were up in arms that this was posted and, you know, there's a big fuss about it and ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, uh, so you'll --
L:  Yeah, um --
R:  -- you'll be more likely here to hear native jokes than --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- than African American jokes but, um, and I --
L:  Yeah, like in -- in certain parts of L.A. depending where I am, like in the predominantly black areas, uh, you know, it's more likely I'll hear a black joke.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But like in the predominantly Latino areas I'll hear, you know, those types of jokes, so ...
R:  Right.  
L:  It --
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, I really think that jokes are just a way -- a means of, like, dealing with things without actually having to look at it really seriously.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And kind a just by joking about it you kind a just like fluff it off.  Like it's no big deal.
R:  Yeah.  Well, that's stress relievers.
L:  So ...
R:  Um, my husband and I just love the Simpsons. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And there's so many people out there who just think it's the worst thing on Earth and how could you let your kids watch that.  It's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, where actually it -- there's a lot of streams running through the Simpson that are quite moralistic and --
L:  Yes.
R:  You know, God and religion is in there all the time.  And -- and, uh, you know, truth and justice, sort of, always do prevail.  It's, you know, and ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Even if Bart farts along the way or [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know, Homer does something really gross or --
L:  Yeah, [MN].
R:  -- or something and, um --
L:  It all ends up working out.
R:  Yeah.  Um, but I mean most of the people who really hate the Simpson never watch it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  They've --
R:  So ...
L:  They've seen one or two shows.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And heard, like, the crude jokes and didn't really pay attention to it.
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  But I think a lot of the jokes that are in -- well, a lot of TV shows are like -- they address like the problems in -- in -- at least in America, um, and typically, from what I've -- wh- what I've seen, the people that don't like certain shows are the people that -- like are ne- -- have negative feelings against the people who they joke about.  Who the shows joke about.
R:  Yeah, maybe.
L:  Um, like Will and Grace. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Have you -- do you watch that?
R:  I've seen it a few times but --
L:  Um.
R:  -- I'm not a regular.
L:  Like a lot of people -- most people that I've met that don't like that show don't like it because they make jokes about -- because like the two main --
R:  Because they're homophobic?
L:  -- characters are -- right.  Are homosexual and they -- they can't stand -- they -- they don't condone watching shows like that.  That's pretty --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- much the attitude that they've --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- given me.  
R:  Yeah --
L:  So ...
R:  -- they don't look at is whether it's funny or not just, you know, that you don't talk about people like that or ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  They just don't like gays or ...  Yeah.  Um, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's hard to tell.  [COUGH]  I don't like -- I -- I can't [MN] -- like I say I can't really think of anything that's really offended me but I'm pretty liberal.
L:  Yes.  As am I.  
R:  So ...
L:  I've -- I've take jokes a lot.  I make jokes a lot.  Um, and I don't -- I don't know.  I -- I tend to limit my -- I -- I police myself when I'm around certain -- certain groups of people.
R:  Yeah.  I think everybody [MN] self edits depending on their -- their au- audience.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, [MN] if --if me and my husband are just there I might
