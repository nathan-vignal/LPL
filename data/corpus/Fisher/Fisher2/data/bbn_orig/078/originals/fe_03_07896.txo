R:  [NOISE] Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  [NOISE] Hi.  I'm, uh, Anne [NOISE] from Massachusetts. [NOISE] 
L:  Hello Anne.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I'm Ben --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- from Tampa.
R:  Oh, cool. [NOISE] Um, so would [NOISE] -- if you were offered [NOISE] a million dollars would you [NOISE] not speak with your best friend for [NOISE] ever?
L:  Well, I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- hardly ever --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- see my good friends anyway.  I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- don't know whether the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- stipulation would say --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that I couldn't talk to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- them ever or --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- send them email ever.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Um, it really depends on how it was defined.
R:  I think it [NOISE] was that you couldn't -- [NOISE] you couldn't talk to them any more. [NOISE]
L:  What's that?
R:  [NOISE] I think the stipulation [NOISE] was that you [NOISE] couldn't talk to them [NOISE] any more.  Or was it that [NOISE] you couldn't see them? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, see --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that's the thing.
R:  Oh, [NOISE] that's a good [NOISE] point but like I think that maybe that's just [NOISE] sort of like a [NOISE] technicality.  I think the basic point is [NOISE] that, um, [NOISE] the question was whether you'd like [NOISE] not contact your best friend [NOISE] ever again. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, well in that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  case; no, I don't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- think I would.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't think --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- there -- there -- I don't think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- there would be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- enough money, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to be offered for that. 
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  I think I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- would go crazy if I didn't get --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to talk to my good friends.
R:  [NOISE] Well, it'd only [NOISE] be one; your [NOISE] best friend. [NOISE] It wouldn't be that [NOISE] you had to cut [NOISE] off all of your good friends. [NOISE] 
L:  Well, seeings as --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- how that would --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- probably be my --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- fiance; no, I don't think so.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE] Yeah, I guess that's [NOISE] sort of like [NOISE]   Maybe that's [NOISE] sort of a unique [NOISE] situation though. [NOISE] Like whether it's someone you're sp- -- [NOISE] planning to like live with [NOISE] for the rest of your life [LAUGH] --
L:  Well, yeah, that's true.
R:  [NOISE] Whereas it's someone you're [NOISE] like a friend [NOISE] with and you like [NOISE] go to movies with and stuff. [NOISE]
L:  Seems like a difficult --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- question to -- to define.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, that's true.  It is pretty vague. [NOISE] I think that -- I don't know. [NOISE] Like a million dollars is a lot of money like. [NOISE] I mean, I [NOISE] really like my [NOISE] best friend a lot but [NOISE] I don't know, we haven't been [NOISE] friends for so long that I don't think [NOISE] that I could have another [NOISE] friend that I'm just as [NOISE] close to in the future [NOISE] or that, [NOISE] even if I neglect -- uh, even if I turned down the million [NOISE] dollars we wouldn't eventually like -- like stop [NOISE] talking each other eventually anyway, you know? [NOISE]
L:  Well, yeah, but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean I -- I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just ran through some quick numbers --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in my head.
R:  Mhm.
L:  If --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  If you plan on living --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- another fifty years or so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- then that's about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't know.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's less than a hundred dollars a day.  I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- would you spend a hundred dollars to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- go see your best friend for a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- day?
R:  [NOISE] Um --
L:  You know, if you --
R:  No --
L:  -- wanted to go --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- see your best friend --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and she was in another --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- state or something like that.  You had to fly out there.
R:  [NOISE] N- --
L:  You know, it's not a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- whole lot of money when you -- when you think about how much --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is that per day. 
R:  [NOISE] That's true.
L:  It's like taking --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Taking a job that pays you a certain --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- amount of money for not --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- doing something.
R:  It's like incredible [NOISE] seed money though. [NOISE] Like you could [NOISE] invest that money [NOISE] or start up a [NOISE] company.  Or like [NOISE], you know, just a lot of other things to get you started [NOISE] into making a lot more money. [NOISE] Like once you [NOISE] have a lot of money [NOISE] it's easier to make [NOISE] more money [NOISE] and --
L:  Hm, that's true.
R:  -- [NOISE] the way -- and the way like [NOISE] things are looking for [NOISE] me now, like I can't really [NOISE] -- like I can't really [NOISE] expect to make that [NOISE] kind of money ever. [LAUGH] You know?
L:  Yeah, well, I guess --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hm, if you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  If you get --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- two percent interest on it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- at a bank then that's what? 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Uh, let's see --
R:  [NOISE] Well, ten percent [NOISE] would be, um, [NOISE] a hundred thousand. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, so one --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- percent is ten thousand.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, it depends on the interest rate. [NOISE] I mean, you know --
R:  [NOISE] And also if you would get taxes [NOISE] taken out of it [NOISE] when you -- when you [NOISE] first got the contribution. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Okay, so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Just living off the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- income from having an --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- extra million dollars would --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- at least be part of a decent --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- sized income --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- depending on what you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- did with it and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- whether you were willing to --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- take money out of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- principal.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  So, yeah, okay.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, you would --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- have a comfortable living.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Uh, you wouldn't have to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- worry about money, you would just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- have to, you know, either --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- work for luxuries or --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- something like that.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, would that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- be enough to offset, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- not talking to your friend?
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  And I guess it's also --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- an ethical choice in that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's not just a choice that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- affects you.  It also --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- affects your best friend.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Would you deny --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- your best friend the pleasure --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of ever contacting you ever again --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in return for them --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- not getting anything at all?
R:  [NOISE] I think though that, um, [NOISE] the snub would [NOISE] be enough.  That like [NOISE] my best friend probably wouldn't [NOISE] care that much. [NOISE] 
L:  Hm.
R:  [NOISE] You know, that it would [NOISE] -- he would decide that [NOISE] maybe I wasn't worth being [NOISE] best friends with after all. [NOISE]
L:  Hm, so if y- --
R:  [NOISE] If I was that sort of [NOISE] like materialist person.  Or [NOISE] maybe he would understand. [NOISE] 
L:  So, if y- -- if your best friend just stopped talking to you and you found out --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- from somebody else that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, it -- it was just because she'd --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- gotten a million dollars not to talk to you ever again --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you would understand?
R:  [NOISE] Well, maybe [NOISE] I'd put myself in the situation. [NOISE] Like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Like here I am [NOISE] sort of saying that -- that's [NOISE] something that I would do [NOISE] maybe.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] So, I don't know [NOISE] if I'd be able to [NOISE] hold it against [NOISE] someone else to [NOISE] -- if they did it [NOISE] to me. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, and I assume --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's just one --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- specific person, you know, if --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you -- you know, whoever --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- then became your best friend --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you'd still be able to talk to them.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, yeah. [NOISE] But it might be [NOISE] true that if you [NOISE] did that to your best friend, your other friends -- [NOISE] cause that's how things usually [NOISE] work, they're like [NOISE] -- your friends are all sort of like [NOISE] related -- would be so upset that they [NOISE] wouldn't wanna --
L:  Well, that's true.  They probably wouldn't be too happy about that.  They'd probably --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- say, "Well, why should I hang out with you if you're --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just gonna dump me the next --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- time you get a million dollars? 
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] [NOISE] Or you could just take [NOISE] them all on a really [NOISE] fancy trip. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Hm.
R:  [NOISE] Or you could even [NOISE] share some of the money with your best [NOISE] friend.  Like [NOISE] maybe it would sort of [NOISE] sweeten the deal if it was like [LAUGH] you and your best friend can [NOISE] each have five hundred thousand dollars [NOISE] if you agree [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- not talk to each [NOISE] other any more. [NOISE]
L:  And it depends on what you mean by contact.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, you can --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- give your second best friend half --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a million dollars and ask --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- them to anonymously --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- donate half a million --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- dollars to your --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- best friend. 
R:  [NOISE] Mhm. [NOISE] I mean, also like [NOISE] you don't know if you would really ha- -- [NOISE] like not have to talk to them [NOISE] ever again.  Like who is this? [NOISE] And if it's anonymous benefactor, [NOISE] who's to say that that benefactor like really [NOISE] knows anything about you or your [NOISE] life or whether you're really [NOISE] talking your best friend, [NOISE] you know. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, well they could --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  They could use investigators --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in law firms and such.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  There's a lot of things --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you can do and still --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- stay anonymous to the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- people you're doing it with or to.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  And then that [NOISE] brings up the point [NOISE] that like if there's [NOISE] someone who wants to give [NOISE] you a million dollars not [NOISE] to talk to someone [NOISE], like that's pretty creepy [NOISE] and maybe you shouldn't be taking that person's [NOISE] money. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] And sort of like [NOISE] by accepting that sort of, um, that sort of gift you're sort of inviting [NOISE] sor- -- like -- like personal interference [NOISE] from this person [NOISE] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for the [NOISE] rest of your life, maybe.
L:  Yeah.  How are --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they going to monitor it?
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  You know, whose --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  -- privacy are they gonna invade? 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Are they gonna listen --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to every phone call you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ever make? 
R:  [NOISE] And why do they care? [NOISE]
L:  Are they gonna --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- follow you around where --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you go, or are they trying --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to isolate your --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- best friend specifically and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- making the same deal --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- with all of their friends?  You know?
R:  [NOISE] Or isolating your best friend [NOISE] for some other [NOISE] like sinister purpose. [NOISE]
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] I think the -- maybe the like [NOISE] anonymity of the [NOISE] -- of the benefactor [NOISE] is one of the most [NOISE] -- more like troubling aspects [NOISE] 'cause it's just so creepy [NOISE] if that like actually happened. [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, I think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- maybe a parallel --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- question would be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Would a million dollars --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- be enough to console --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you and make you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- think it was a -- an overall --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- positive thing --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if for some entirely --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- different reason your --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- best friend couldn't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- contact you ever again?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  You know, if --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  If they got religion --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and went off to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Africa on mission work --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and just stayed there doing that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and just didn't have an --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- opportunity to send mail --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to you or anything.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  You know, and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for that reason you never --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- got to contact your --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- best friend again but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, during the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- same time period --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you got a million dollars.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Looking back on that year --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Would you say overall it was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a good year or --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a bad year?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I probably [NOISE] would say that it was.  But that's [NOISE] also your best [NOISE] friend doing something of like [NOISE] his own deciding like. [NOISE] 
L:  True.
R:  [NOISE] Or, "I'm gonna do this". [NOISE] Like that's sort [NOISE] of more like a [NOISE] natural course of life thing. [NOISE] Like people move apart, [NOISE] people take new jobs, people get like new --
L:  Yeah, you're not --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- really being asked to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- take any responsibility in that.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] Yeah, you're sort [NOISE] of like relieved of that [NOISE] like evil doing [NOISE] of like [NOISE] neglecting your best friend.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] I guess it depends [NOISE] on like all the other [NOISE] information.  Also like how close you are [NOISE] with your best friend. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, and --
R:  Like, I mean, if [NOISE] I was much older and, um, [NOISE] it was harder for me to meet [NOISE] people or something, or [NOISE] I didn't have as many friends [NOISE] from my youth then it would [NOISE] be more important --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- for me [NOISE] to keep my best friend. [NOISE]
L:  That's true.
R:  Especially if it was like [NOISE] I didn't have very many other friends. [NOISE] 
L:  Hm.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  And if it's just a matter of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  What amount of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- money would be enough? 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- start the bidding.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, what --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- about just a new car?  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know?  What about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a dollar?  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, would --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- that be enough?
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Probably not.
R:  [NOISE] No way. [NOISE]
L:  What about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- half a million dollars?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, is it -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Is it a psychological number?  Is it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, just because it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You're up at --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- seven digits.  You know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Would a dollar less than --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a million be enough? 
R:  [NOISE] I think it's sort of [NOISE] like, um, [NOISE] what is it called? [NOISE] Like cost benefit analysis. [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] Like, how put out of your way or how [NOISE] inconvenienced, or like [NOISE] how painful would it be [NOISE] to like sever that relationship [NOISE] versus --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- all the joys that [NOISE] a million dollars can bring you? [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, or you can --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- consider it in terms of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, if you were --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- suing somebody for --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- making sure that you --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- never got to contact your --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- best friend again. [NOISE] How much damages would you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ask for?
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  You know, or if you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- were on the jury on that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- case, how much do you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- think would be reasonable? 
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE]
