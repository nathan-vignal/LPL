L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  I'm Laurie.
R:  I'm Diane.
L:  And where are you calling from?
R:  I'm in Atlanta, Georgia.
L:  Oh, so you're not too far, I'm in Oak [inaudible], Florida.
R:  Okay.
L:  Last time it was, um, Brooklyn, New York. [LAUGH]
R:  Wow. [LAUGH]
L:  But this isn't gonna be a very, um, um, long topic I don't --
R:  Right.
L:  -- think. [LAUGH]
R:  I don't think so either.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You wanna go first, or you want me to go or ...?
L:  Um, you can go first.
R:  Okay.  Um, I -- I don't -- it's kind of a hard one 'cause I'm really not sure.  I don't think I would unless, I mean, I -- I doubt, um, [SIGH] and, you know, I mean, I -- I've covered for people in minor situations before.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like when my mom doesn't wanna talk to my grandmother on the phone I'll say she's asleep [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I really don't think I would cover for someone who'd committed a crime.
L:  Yeah, and I don't think I [MN] -- a close friend, or I mean a close -- a family member like spouse I don't -- I don't think I would either, but I don't think you have to testify against --
R:  Right.
L:  -- your spouse. [LIPSMACK] 
R:  Right.
L:  Um, but, no, [MN] my pr- you know, problem would be just answering yes or no questions. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right, right.  Um, and I know for me it's -- I would do what I could to help them --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, mount a defense if I felt --
L:  Or --
R:  -- like it was justified but, um, you know, certainly wouldn't lie for them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm -- I don't do very well at lying for myself. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I've had to, um --
R:  Uh --
L:  [LIPSMACK] My dad, um, had -- I -- I kinda had to -- to learn that ad- adults need to face their own consequences kind of thing 'cause my dad's, um, alcoholic --
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- I'm the child of an alcoholic and, you know, used to make any excuses for him when he was, [NOISE] you know, when I was little and -- and that kind of thing, and eventually I just said, "No".
R:  Right, right.
L:  [LIPSMACK] "You're a big boy, you can face the consequences" and it -- the hardest part was him [MN] he was in jail over Christmas one time.
R:  Oh goodness.
L:  And I said, "You know, I was in Orlando that night, you could've hit or killed me that night", you know, he didn't --
R:  Right.
L:  -- he didn't hurt anybody --
R:  Right.
L:  "-- but, um, you know, I said, "You could've".
R:  He could have, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And when I was married, um, there was a -- a young man that was, uh, my husband was friends with his father, and he called us one night, he was in jail, and it was a minor --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- not really minor but he was with someone who stole a car, and he c- says he didn't know what was going on, and we helped -- we bailed him out and gave him a place to stay and my ex husband got him a job and -- but we told him, "You gotta face the consequences of being with this guy, whether or not you knew he was gonna steal this vehicle or not --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- you have to face the consequences of what you did".
L:  Mhm.
R:  "But because we care about you we won't let you, w- you know, we'll get you out of jail and help you defend yourself and help you get money to pay an attorney" uh, you know, well he got a court appointed attorney but to --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- help with whatever he needed.  But then he still wasn't -- he wouldn't -- he didn't show up for one of his court dates.
L:  Ugh.
R:  Well first I had his, um, he wouldn't -- didn't go to work for a couple of days.
L:  Mm.
R:  And, uh, I mean, my husband got him a job at his company.
L:  Ooh.
R:  And he didn't come back to the house and when he did come back we confronted him about it and he lied about where he'd been and what he'd been doing and so I said, "Okay, you can't live here and you can't stay here if you're not gonna be honest with us".
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then he didn't show up for one of his court dates and my husband was gonna just basically fork over the rest of the bail money, what he'd give the -- o- over what he'd given the bondsman --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I said, "No, he has to face the consequences of choosing to l- not show up for his court date --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- and choosing to leave the area and --" I said, "You have to tell the bail bondsman where you think he is.
L:  Mhm.
R:  'Cause he had left the -- he had gone to South Carolina is we -- is what we assumed he had done.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And as it turns out that was exactly what he had done and meanwhile he got a girl pregnant. [LAUGH]
L:  Jeez.
R:  So -- I mean, he was like, nineteen years old.  I was like, "You know, I've done what I could to help him".
L:  Yep.
R:  "I can't do anymore".
L:  Mhm.
R:  "He has to help himself".
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] So ...
L:  Think -- I might have a problem if I knew that, um, somebody -- well, no, I don't know, 'cause if I really thought somebody was innocent and I thought they were facing the death penalty, 'cause I'm not in favor of the death penalty --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I don't know.
R:  Well, if you knew -- if you felt like they were innocent then that's different.
L:  I don't know if I would lie but it might, um, get amnesia.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But y- I -- y- I don't even know if I could then, either.
R:  Yeah, but if --
L:  'Cause, you know, there's --
R:  -- they're innocent there wouldn't be any reason to lie.
L:  There's always appeals and -- and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  I'm not real fond of the death penalty either though I do feel there are cases it's justified, but that's --
L:  Well, they just put -- put 'em in solitary or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or put 'em in with the general population.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, now I've thought that for child molesters, stick 'em in general population and --
L:  Yeah! [LAUGH]
R:  -- let them --
L:  Let's finish them!
R:  -- deal with their consequences! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, uh --
L:  Or put a sign on 'em, "I'm in here for child molestation".
R:  Mm, pretty much.
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's definitely not a d- -- a popular stance in [MN] --
R:  I mean, like I said, I don't -- I feel like it may be used more than it should.  I feel like there are some cases where, I mean, the people just simply cannot be rehabilitated.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Psychopaths.
L:  Yeah.
R:  For example, I mean the -- I work in mental health.  I'd --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I've worked in it for six years and have an interview later this week for a job that hopefully I will be working in the field again.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and I've come across people that have no conscience.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
R:  They have no ... sense a -- you know, they -- they'll slit a man's throat and walk on like it never even --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it doesn't even bother 'em.
L:  Yeah.
R:  People like that, they have no conscience, they have no soul.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They need to be removed from [LAUGH] society permanently.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And unless they can lock 'em up into a cell and solder the door shut and never let them see the light of day again, right now the death penalty is the best option for them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I mean, like I said, it's very few and far between.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  But, um, yeah, I think [NOISE] -- I'd -- I probably wouldn't -- I'm -- no I wouldn't 'cause, um, my husband -- my husband's an attorney [SIGH].
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  He's not criminal attorney though, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- he, um, we have these kinda discussions all the time.
R:  Right, right.  Well I have a relative who actually was electrocuted in Georgia's electric chair.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH] I never knew him, it was many years before I was ever born, he was --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a distant cousin but there's been a book written about him and a movie, uh, and this was one of my mom's relatives.
L:  Wow.
R:  And so it's -- I mean, it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And I still -- and I feel like for what he did, he deserved it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I mean, he -- he killed a guy for stealing a cow.  And his defense was, "Well, he stole my cow, of course I had to kill him".
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "Okay.  Would you do it again if he stole another cow?"  "Yeah".  [MN]
L:  Now, he didn't do it in the process of the guy stealing the cow, he did it afterwards?
R:  He f- -- he did it afterwards.  He found out the guy had stolen his cow so he went and killed him.
L:  Oh, okay, that's different.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I think in Florida he could probably g- [MN] there's probably some law on the books somewhere that allows you to, um, defend your cattle. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [MN]
R:  Well no, this was afterwards when he was ma- -- he just got mad.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, that's premeditated.
R:  Yeah.  Very premeditated.  Um, and I mean, it's -- if someone comes into my house and -- and attacks me or attacks me and my family --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I hope they don't live to tell about it. [LAUGH]
L:  See, I would like -- if I -- if I knew how to -- if I had a gun and I knew how to use it, I wouldn't shoot to kill them, if I had the presence of mind to do that.
R:  Right.
L:  You know --
R:  Well they say it's better to shoot for the mid center.  I -- I don't know how to shoot a gun, I'm going to be learning, my fiance has guns.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I've told him that when -- before they come into my house he has to teach me how to shoot them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Just so that ... I'll know how to use them, I mean, I don't want 'em in the house --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but [MN] you know, I love him and he has guns, so [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they'll be in the house.  If we ever have children they'll be locked up.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, some -- in the gun safe.  But -- in the -- I -- actually I'm gonna try to get 'em in the gun safe anyway but he, um, you know, I've -- I've said, anybody attacks me and I can shoot them, I will.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But --
L:  But like I said, it -- I -- I wouldn't, um, plan on killing 'em, you know, but if --
R:  Well me either.
L:  -- I was -- but [MN] I mean, who has their head on when --
R:  Right.
L:  -- if they're in the middle of --
R:  But --
L:  -- getting attacked? [LAUGH]
R:  But from what I've --
L:  [inaudible].
R:  -- been told in self defense, in, you know, seminars, is if you're -- if you have a gun shoot for the center mass.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because you're more likely to hit that than the -- because I've always thought, well, I'll try to shoot out a knee so they can't run.
L:  Shoot 'em in the knee.  Yeah, like I can hit a knee! [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]  But --
L:  But --
R:  -- I, um, when my -- when I threw my ex husband out of the house, I went that day and bought a baseball bat.
L:  Now --
R:  To have in case he tried to force his way in and hurt me.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I would have something to defend myself with.
L:  Wow.  So he was, um, kinda violent?
R:  Uh, no, but I didn't know how well he would take coming home and finding out that his key didn't work anymore.
L:  Uh. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] He didn't know he was being thrown out.
L:  Uh.  Well, you know --
R:  So --
L:  -- better safe than [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
