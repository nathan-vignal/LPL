OKAY SO YOU HAVE CHILDREN IS THAT RIGHT OKAY SO HOW DO YOU CONTROL WHAT THEY WATCH ON T._V.  (fe_03_07805-B-0009)
OH OH THEY'RE ADULTS NOW OKAY RIGHT BUT WHEN THEY WERE CHILDREN UH DID YOU LET THEM WATCH UH WHATEVER THEY WANTED TO OR UH  (fe_03_07805-B-0010)
NO OKAY SO SOME COMEDIES WERE INAPPROPRIATE THEY WERE TOO ADULT UM FOR THEM YEAH  (fe_03_07805-B-0011)
YEAH  (fe_03_07805-B-0012)
OKAY AND WOULD IT BE DIFFERENT STANDARDS FOR UH ADULTS UH I GUESS WHEN YOU GO TO MOVIES UH THAT ARE ADULT RATED I GUESS IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT OR NO  (fe_03_07805-B-0013)
YEAH  (fe_03_07805-B-0014)
AND IS IS ANYTHING ACCEPTABLE OR UM IF IT'S INSULTING TO CERTAIN PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE COMEDY USUALLY MAKES FUN OF PEOPLE BUT UM  (fe_03_07805-B-0015)
LIKE HOW FAR CAN THEY GO IN TERMS OF INSULTING PEOPLE  (fe_03_07805-B-0016)
LIKE CAN THEY INSULT A WHOLE RACE OF PEOPLE OR YOU KNOW STUFF LIKE THAT THEY USUALLY MAKE FUN OF DIFFERENT GROUPS RIGHT  (fe_03_07805-B-0017)
OKAY  (fe_03_07805-B-0018)
SO IT JUST IT JUST SHOULD  (fe_03_07805-B-0019)
IT JUST SHOULDN'T BE MEAN RIGHT  (fe_03_07805-B-0020)
YEAH  (fe_03_07805-B-0021)
OKAY  (fe_03_07805-B-0022)
ABOUT T._V. I GUESS IT DEPENDS UH I'M HOUSE SITTING RIGHT NOW AND THEY'VE GOT SOMETHING ON THAT WHENEVER I WATCH CERTAIN SHOWS I HAVE TO PUT IN A SECRET CODE WHICH THE KIDS DON'T KNOW IT'S A ELEVEN YEAR OLD BOY AND A TEN YEAR OLD BOY  (fe_03_07805-B-0023)
AND THAT WAY THEY CONTROL WHAT THE KIDS WATCH  (fe_03_07805-B-0024)
AND SO THERE'S CERTAIN CHANNELS LIKE H._B._O. I DON'T KNOW IF IF YOU GET THAT UM  (fe_03_07805-B-0025)
THAT ARE ARE MUCH MORE ADULT SO THE KIDS CAN'T WATCH THAT SO I THINK IF THERE'S SOME TYPE OF THING BLOCKING KIDS FROM WATCHING IT AND JUST UH RESTRICTING IT TO ADULTS THEN IT'S OKAY  (fe_03_07805-B-0026)
UM WELL THEY'VE GOT THIS THING ON THEIR T._V. HERE IN THIS HOUSE THAT I'M STAYING AT AND IT BLOCKS THE KIDS FROM WATCHING ADULT SHOWS  (fe_03_07805-B-0027)
SO IF THEY HAD SOMETHING LIKE THAT ON ALL THE T._V.S THEN I THEN I THINK THAT UM IT WOULD BE OKAY TO HAVE MORE ADULT COMEDY ON REGULAR TELEVISION  (fe_03_07805-B-0028)
YEAH  (fe_03_07805-B-0029)
YEAH SO YEAH NOW SOME OF THE COMEDY IS VERY INSULTING TO DIFFERENT GROUPS SO I THINK THAT GOES TOO FAR SO I'M PRETTY MUCH IN AGREEMENT WITH YOU  (fe_03_07805-B-0030)
YEAH I LIKED THAT SHOW ACTUALLY BUT THERE THERE'S SOMETHING SOFT ABOUT THE WAY HE DID IT HE [MN] IT WASN'T THAT HATEFUL DID YOU FIND IT DISTURBING  (fe_03_07805-B-0031)
YEAH  (fe_03_07805-B-0032)
UM HE HAD A GOOD HEART SO THAT MADE IT A LITTLE BIT BETTER  (fe_03_07805-B-0033)
ALSO IN THE BEGINNING UH IT WAS ALMOST AS IF HE WAS THE BUTT OF THE JOKE AS OPPOSED TO WHOEVER HE WAS MAKING FUN OF THEY DIDN'T MAKE HIM TOO GLAMOROUS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT  (fe_03_07805-B-0034)
IT IT JUST IT JUST DIDN'T SEEM ALL THAT MEAN TO ME  (fe_03_07805-B-0035)

ARE THERE ANY COMEDIES ON SHO- ON T._V. THAT YOU'VE LIKED IN THE PAST  (fe_03_07805-B-0043)
OKAY DID YOU WATCH LIKE THE LUCY SHOW OR MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW OR ANYTHING YEARS AGO OR NOT REALLY  (fe_03_07805-B-0044)
RIGHT  (fe_03_07805-B-0045)
WELL MOST OF THE SHOWS ARE REALLY MADE FOR TEENAGERS THEY'RE THE AUDIENCE THAT THE ADVERTISERS ARE TRYING TO GET AT  (fe_03_07805-B-0046)
SO PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN AROUND FOR A WHILE WHO REMEMBER ARCHIE BUNKER LIKE YOU OR ME WERE NOT EXACTLY THE AUDIENCE THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SO THEY MAKE THE SHOW FOR YOUNGER PEOPLE  (fe_03_07805-B-0047)
IT'S GETTING OLDER  (fe_03_07805-B-0048)
THAT'S TRUE  (fe_03_07805-B-0049)
RIGHT IF THEY MADE SHOWS MORE FOR FOR OUR AGE GROUP DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD BE MORE INTERESTED IN WATCHING T._V. OR OR YOUR JUST DONE WITH T._V. ANYWAYS  (fe_03_07805-B-0050)
