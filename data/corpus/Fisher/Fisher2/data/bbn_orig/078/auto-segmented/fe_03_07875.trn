AND I THINK FOR FOR FOR ME IF I WERE TO HAVE TO CHANGE SOMETHING I PROBABLY WOULD GO BACK AND I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE STARTED UM GRADUATE SCHOOL RIGHT AFTER I GOT OUT OF COLLEGE  (fe_03_07875-A-0008)
UM ONLY BECAUSE I'VE BEEN OUT OF WHAT COLLEGE NOW FOR ABOUT TEN YEARS  (fe_03_07875-A-0009)
AND IT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN A WISER DECISION MAYBE IF I WENT RIGHT INTO GRADUATE SCHOOL THAT WAY I THINK I WOULD HAVE HAD MORE EXPERIENCE BEHIND ME WHEN POSSIBLY LOOKING FOR A JOB  (fe_03_07875-A-0010)
UM SO THAT PROBABLY WAS A GOOD THING FOR ME TO LOOK AT I THINK AS FAR AS UM NOWADAYS THE ECONOMY IS NOT THAT GREAT  (fe_03_07875-A-0011)
I THINK THE MORE THAT YOU CAN HAVE BEHIND YOU  (fe_03_07875-A-0012)
WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A JOB THE BETTER OFF YOU'RE GOING TO BE  (fe_03_07875-A-0013)
SO THAT PROBABLY WOULD BE MY THING AS FAR AS LOOKING AT UM  (fe_03_07875-A-0014)
YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD CHANGE IF I COULD GO BACK IN TIME AND UM I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE THAT I CAN THINK OF  (fe_03_07875-A-0015)

TOO OLD NOW TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT UM I GUESS YOU'RE NEVER TOO OLD BUT YOU KNOW THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN SOMETHING  (fe_03_07875-A-0019)
YEAH YOU HOPE SO RIGHT [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_07875-A-0020)
BUT THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN OPTION I MIGHT HAVE LOOKED AT WITH ADOPTION  (fe_03_07875-A-0021)
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER AND IF I HAD SOMEONE ELSE THAT COULD SUPPORT THE CHILD WITH ME SO  (fe_03_07875-A-0022)
MHM  (fe_03_07875-A-0024)

SO FOR ME IT WAS A GOOD SAFE WAY WHEN YOU TAKE A FOREIGN LANGUAGE BECAUSE I'M ALSO BILINGUAL IN SPANISH THAT'S ONE OF MY OTHER DEGREES FROM COLLEGE  (fe_03_07875-A-0029)
UM  (fe_03_07875-A-0030)
YOU KNOW I WOULD HAVE POSSIBLY MAYBE CHANGED SOMETHING I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE LEARNED MORE LANGUAGES  (fe_03_07875-A-0031)
YOU KNOW THAT COULD HAVE BEEN SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN FEASIBLE IF I COULD GO BACK IN TIME AND YOU KNOW CHANGE SOMETHING SURE I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE LEARNED FIVE LANGUAGES  (fe_03_07875-A-0032)
YOU KNOW IF THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE BUT YOU KNOW THAT THAT WOULD JUST BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE YOU KNOW TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT  (fe_03_07875-A-0033)
I MEAN I STUDIED ABROAD FOR TWO YEARS  (fe_03_07875-A-0034)
UH WHERE DID YOU STUDY  (fe_03_07875-A-0035)
OKAY 'CAUSE I WAS IN SPAIN FOR LIKE A LITTLE BIT OVER A YEAR AND IF I COULD GO BACK NOW I WOULD HAVE TO STAY THERE LONGER  (fe_03_07875-A-0036)
YEAH  (fe_03_07875-A-0037)
BUT I KNOW THAT WOULD HAVE DELAYED ME YOU KNOW GRADUATING FROM COLLEGE  (fe_03_07875-A-0038)

UM YOU KNOW I THINK EVERYBODY SAYS THAT BUT I WISH THAT MAYBE I WOULD HAVE HAD A BETTER RELATIONSHIP I MEAN I HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH MY PARENTS NOW BUT IF I COULD HAVE GONE BACK AND HAD A BETTER RELATIONSHIP WHEN I WAS YOUNGER WITH MY PARENTS  (fe_03_07875-A-0044)
I THINK THAT THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN UM A MORE POSITIVE THING FOR ME GROWING UP AS A CHILD  (fe_03_07875-A-0045)
