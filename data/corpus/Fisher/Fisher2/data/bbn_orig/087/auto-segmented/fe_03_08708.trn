I AM FORTY SEVEN  (fe_03_08708-A-0006)
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT WELL YOU KNOW I REMEMBER UH WHEN YOU KNOW THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO HAD A CALCULATOR OR ANYTHING TECHNICAL WERE PEOPLE LIKE ENGINEERS  (fe_03_08708-A-0007)
AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT OUR CHILDREN TODAY THAT WE HAVE UH SOME OF THEM HAVE NEVER THE TIMES WHEN THERE WASN'T A COMPUTER  (fe_03_08708-A-0008)
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY YOU KNOW I KINDA FORGET THAT TOO [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08708-A-0009)

YES AND YOU KNOW THE THE WHOLE SECRET TO THAT THAT I'VE FOUND I'VE BEEN AN EDUCATOR NOW FOR TWENTY THREE YEARS  (fe_03_08708-A-0015)
AND THE THE SECRET THAT I'VE FOUND FOR ME  (fe_03_08708-A-0016)
IS THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THESE THINGS AS TOOLS THEY'RE EXTENSIONS THAT WE CAN USE THEY'RE NOT UH THE END ALL AND THE BE ALL AND I THINK WE HAVE TO HAVE THE BASIC KNOWLEDGE  (fe_03_08708-A-0017)
FIRST AND THEN ONCE THEY LEARN THE BASIC KNOWLEDGE THIS IS A TOOL THAT JUST HELPS US GET IT DONE QUICKER  (fe_03_08708-A-0018)
AND IT'S KINDA LIKE TO ME COMPARING GETTING OUT AND DIGGING IN THE DIRT WITH YOUR HANDS OR DIGGING IN THE DIRT WITH A HOE  (fe_03_08708-A-0019)
YOU YOU YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU NEED TO DIG AND WHY YOU'RE DIGGING NO MATTER WHAT [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08708-A-0020)
MHM  (fe_03_08708-A-0021)
MHM  (fe_03_08708-A-0022)
OH YEAH WELL OF COURSE YOU HAVE I MEAN UH THAT'S A VALID WORRY I MEAN BUT WHAT I THINK IS THAT UM IN MY CLASSROOM THE WAY I DO IT  (fe_03_08708-A-0023)
IS WE DO USE CALCULATORS BUT WE BEFORE WE USE THE CALCULATORS WE LEARN HOW TO DO IT THE OTHER WAY  (fe_03_08708-A-0024)
AND THEN I USE THE CALCULATORS TO UM ONCE THEY HAVE GOTTEN UH OH WHAT WORD AM I LOOKING FOR ONCE THEY'VE GOTTEN THE RECIPE OF HOW TO WORK THE PARTICULAR SAY MATH PROBLEM  (fe_03_08708-A-0025)
UH-HUH THEN WE USE THE UH CALCULATORS OR THE COMPUTERS OR WHATEVER TO HELP UM  (fe_03_08708-A-0026)
JUST TO HELP THEM DO IT THEN I STUDY WHETHER OR NOT THEY KNOW THE RIGHT STEPS THEY'RE GOING THROUGH YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT THAT IS I TEACH THEM THE STEPS WITH THAT  (fe_03_08708-A-0027)
UH I'VE TAUGHT EVERY GRADE UP THROUGH EIGHTH GRADE I  (fe_03_08708-A-0028)

MAYBE SOMEBODY ELSE CAN YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08708-A-0032)
AND I ONE THING THAT WE'RE DOING NOW THAT COMPUTERS HELP US DO AND UH CALCULATORS ONE OF THE THING THAT WE'RE DOING NOW IS THAT WE'RE HAVING A LOT MORE PARENT TEACHER COMMUNICATION  (fe_03_08708-A-0033)
THAN WE USED TO  (fe_03_08708-A-0034)
ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE  (fe_03_08708-A-0035)

AS YOU ARE YES WHO ENCOURAGE YOU KNOW AND AND WANT THEM TO LEARN THE STEPS BUT THEY'RE JUST SKIPPING AHEAD AND JUST TEACHING THE CHILDREN TO USE THE CALCULATORS JUST TO GET TO THAT STEP WITHOUT LEARNING AND UNDERSTANDING WHY THEY GOT THERE  (fe_03_08708-B-0036)
OH IN ANY IN ANY PROFESSION THERE'S PEOPLE LIKE THAT I UNDERSTAND  (fe_03_08708-B-0037)
