TH- THE THING I I THINK IT'S GOOD BUT UM  (fe_03_08700-A-0004)
I THINK THE PROBLEM WITH WITH WITH THAT IS LIKE THE FUNDING I THINK LIKE MIDDLE CLASS NEIGHBORHOODS AND SCHOOLS WOULD PROBABLY HAVE  (fe_03_08700-A-0005)
M- BE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE COMPUTERS WHEREAS UM THE LOWER INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS WOULDN'T AND THEN THEN OF COURSE THAT JUST KIND OF WIDENS  (fe_03_08700-A-0006)
ONCE AGAIN THE THE GAP BETWEEN THE LOWER INCOME KIDS AND THE HIGHER INCOME KIDS SO THAT'S  (fe_03_08700-A-0007)
THAT'S THE BAD THING I SEE ABOUT IT IS I WOULD WANT THE COMPUTERS TO BE AVAILABLE FOR ALL THE SCHOOLS NOT JUST  (fe_03_08700-A-0008)
NOT JUST SOME OF THE SCHOOLS  (fe_03_08700-A-0009)

CLICK ON A COMPUTER TO GET THEIR RESEARCH BUT IT'S MORE DIFFICULT FOR SOME KIDS THEY COULD GO TO THE LIBRARY AND GET THE INFORMATION JUST THE SAME IT'S JUST  (fe_03_08700-A-0014)
THE ACCESS ISN'T NECESSARILY AS READILY AVAILABLE AND I I THINK THERE SHOULD BE A BALANCE ALSO I THINK I THINK IT'S GOOD FOR KIDS TO USE LIKE  (fe_03_08700-A-0015)
YOU KNOW THE OLD FASHIONED ENCYCLOPEDIAS AND ALL THAT WHEN THEY HAVE TO DO RESEARCH INSTEAD OF JUST I KNOW MYSELF NOW IF IF I THINK OF DOING RESEARCH THE FIRST PLACE I GO TO IS THE INTERNET  (fe_03_08700-A-0016)
AND I KNOW GROWING UP IT WASN'T AS  (fe_03_08700-A-0017)
IT WE STARTED USING COMPUTERS A LITTLE BIT LIKE EVERYTIME WE WENT TO THE LIBRARY WE MIGHT HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF [SIGH] YOU KNOW MEDIA FUN OR WHERE YOU YOU PLAY SOME GAMES OR SOMETHING ON THE COMPUTER BUT I MEAN NOW I THINK  (fe_03_08700-A-0018)

IT'S A GIVEN FOR A LOT OF THE KIDS TO JUST GO STRAIGHT TO THE COMPUTER AND YOU KNOW THEY NEED TO KNOW [MN]  (fe_03_08700-A-0020)

YOU KNOW THEY DON'T KNOW TO CHECK TO SEE IS IS THIS A LEGIT SITE OR OR WHAT AND THEY MIGHT BE DOING RESEARCH ON  (fe_03_08700-A-0026)
YOU KNOW A FIFTH GRADE SCIENCE PROJECT AND THEY'RE READING STUFF FROM SOMEBODY'S PERSONAL WEBPAGE THAT MIGHT BE COMPLETELY UNSCIENTIFIC  (fe_03_08700-A-0027)

IT MIGHT MAKE THE LEARNING MORE INTERESTING IF  (fe_03_08700-A-0045)
THEY NEED TO USE IT AND FIND THAT YOU KNOW THEY CAN ACTUALLY LEARN STUFF WITH IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW IF THEY'RE DOING IT AT HOME AND THEY'RE DOING GAMES AND MAYBE AT SCHOOL THEY'RE USING COMPUTERS IN IN DIFFERENT WAYS UM  (fe_03_08700-A-0046)

BUT THE PROBLEM ABOUT THAT IS THAT ALSO [SIGH]  (fe_03_08700-B-0021)

THINGS ARE JUST CHANGING LIKE S- AT SUCH A HIGHER RATE NOW THAT YOU KNOW ALL OF THIS IS AVAILABLE THAT LIKE  (fe_03_08700-B-0023)

RIGHT AND I THINK ALSO THAT TEACHERS  (fe_03_08700-B-0037)
NOW AT LEAST SOMEWHAT HAVE TO BE AWARE OF YOU KNOW THE INTERNET BEING NOT THE BEST PLACE I MEAN NOT NECESSARILY LIKE YOU KNOW I MEAN IF A KID IS LIKE I GOT IT OFF THE INTERNET  (fe_03_08700-B-0038)
A TEACHER CAN STILL BE LIKE WELL YOU KNOW I MEAN  (fe_03_08700-B-0039)
IT'S KIND OF THE TEACHER AND THE PARENTS' RESPONSIBILITY BUT A LITTLE BIT MORE OF THE TEACHER'S RESPONSIBILITY TO EXPLAIN WHAT A GOOD SITE IS AND WHAT ISN'T  (fe_03_08700-B-0040)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08700-B-0041)

EASY TO FIND THAT YOU KNOW THEY RE- REPEAT THE SAME PAPER OVER AND OVER AND THEY'RE ALL KIND OF BAD [MN]  (fe_03_08700-B-0048)
I MEAN THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY VERY GOOD SO I MEAN PEOPLE CAN DO THAT BUT THEY WOULD GET CAUGHT I THINK  (fe_03_08700-B-0049)
VERY I THINK IT'S YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW I DON'T THINK IT'S AS BIG OF A I THINK PEOPLE DO USE IT BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S AS BIG OF A PROBLEM AS PEOPLE MIGHT MAKE IT OUT TO BE  (fe_03_08700-B-0050)
IN THAT PARTICULAR WAY  (fe_03_08700-B-0051)
ON THE OTHER HAND I GOT ACCUSED OF PLAGIARISM AND I DEFINITELY DIDN'T DO IT BUT I MEAN I I WAS ABLE TO DEFEND MYSELF BUT IT WAS NOT A GOOD EXPERIENCE [MN] PARTICULARLY  (fe_03_08700-B-0052)
