R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I'm Jackie.
R:  [MN] [SIGH] Hi, Jackie, this is Mary.  Where are you from, Jackie?
L:  Um, I live in Plainfield, Illinois.
R:  Oh, Illinois.

R:  I'm in Barneveld[?], Wisconsin.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]   
R:  Is this part of the University of Pennsylvania study, is that --
L:  Yes, yeah.
R:  Oh, okay. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  And -- and they're just looking at how we speak, right?  They don't necessarily care about exercise, right?
L:  [SIGH] I don't really know. [LAUGH] My sister just told me about this, so I signed up for it.
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] funny.
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] I didn't -- I though I was going to get questions from somebody, I didn't realize you just talked with somebody.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, funny.
L:  [NOISE] I haven't done this before.  Actually, they called one other time and they said, "Hold for a partner" and I was holding and holding and holding and holding [LAUGH] so, then I just hung up.
R:  And nobody came on, yeah, that's what happened to me the first time too.
L:  Oh, did it?
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] Okay.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, so, how [LAUGH] --
R:  So, they want to --
L:  [SIGH] Are you a regular --
R:  Are you what?
L:  Do you exercise regularly? [LAUGH] 
R:  No, not really. [LAUGH] 
L:  Neither do I. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  On, occasion [NOISE] [SIGH] I try.
R:  I know I should.
L:  I try, but I have a hectic life.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] Do you have kids?
R:  Mhm, yeah, we're married and we have two boys that are three and five.
L:  Oh, you got little ones.
R:  Yeah, how about you?
L:  I am married and I have three kids, two teenagers, two boys and a --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- little g- uh, ten year old little girl. [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah, so I have my hands full. [SIGH] 
R:  So, you're busy going to ball games and all that --
L:  Oh. [SIGH] 
R:  -- kind of stuff?
L:  All the time. [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Really?
L:  The boys play for high school and that just ended, now they'll play for [SIGH] traveling team and my daughter plays some soccer and does gymnastics, so [COUGH] I'm --
R:  Oh, my gosh. 
L:  -- always on the go.
R:  [SIGH] Is -- is [NOISE] where you're at, is that a suburb of Chicago?
L:  Yeah, it's a suburb, mhm.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.
L:  I used to live in the city.  We lived in -- well, actually, all my life --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I've lived in Chicago and we just moved out here about [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] two and a half years ago. [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you like living out, now? [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, I do.  Yeah, it's a lot of different, but it's nice.
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  Nice for the kids. [NOISE] [SIGH] you know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it's quieter and everything than the city.
R:  Safer?
L:  Yeah, I think so.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  So far. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] I mean, anywhere you go there's craziness, but, yeah, I would think it's safer than the --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- city.
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] so, are you north of the city or south?
L:  I'm south.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, okay. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah, [SIGH] so, you're in Wisconsin?
R:  [COUGH] We are, yeah, but we're only about [SIGH] an hour or so from the border, from the Illinois border.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, we -- I've [MN] -- I guess I've been to Chicago two or three times, it's not that bad, it's, like, maybe [SIGH] [NOISE] I don't know, two or three hours.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, that's not too bad. [NOISE] 
R:  Something like that. [SIGH] I really want to go to Oprah. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, do you? [LAUGH] 
R:  Have you ever?
L:  Yeah, one time I was there.
R:  Did you?
L:  Oh, years ago, yeah.  I don't even remember what they were talking about when I went.
R:  [NOISE] And did you just call in, is that how you got the tickets?
L:  A friend of mine had 'em and she asked me if I wanted to go. [SIGH] I'm not even sure how she got 'em, probably ordered them.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
L:  Yeah, so --
R:  Oh, I'm [SIGH] --
L:  -- I'm sure there's a waiting list, though.
R:  [SIGH] Well, [MN] I was told that you just call on this number, you know, that they offer on her website.
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH] But every time I call it's either busy or they're not taking calls.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  [LAUGH] But I just thought that'd be are really fun thing to do. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, it was -- it's -- it's fun just o experience it. [NOISE] 
R:  Was it?
L:  Yeah, it was.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah, it had to be, like, almost -- I'd say almost six years ago. [NOISE] [SIGH] 
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Uh-huh, [SIGH] but --
R:  [SIGH] but you didn't have to pay, though, for your ticket?
L:  No, I don't --
R:  [SIGH] Is -- is there a s-
L:  -- I don't think you pay for them.
R:  [SIGH] Is the studio downtown?
L:  [LIPSMACK] It's not exactly downtown, it's not in a very good area at all.
R:  Oh.
L:  But, um, [SIGH] you know, if you get a ride there, it's okay --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- but it -- you know, it's just -- it's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it's really -- I -- I d -- I didn't realize it when we went, but it's really in a bad area.
R:  [SIGH] Can you take, like, the elevator, or anything?
L:  [LIPSMACK] I really don't know, it's just --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- so long ago.  I know when we went, we drove.  Um --
R:  Oh, no, so you were [NOISE] worried about you car? [NOISE] 
L:  No, not too much, 'cause, you know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I figured with -- with her show and stuff --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they have security [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  -- but, um, yeah, it's just not the nicest --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- place. [SIGH] But then all of Chicago's not all that great. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, [NOISE] you've got to be careful.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] Are you in a little town?
R:  [SIGH] We are, mhm, yeah. [NOISE] We -- we actually moved here though from San Diego, so --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- w- w- you know, we -- we did live that [SIGH] life too, I guess. [NOISE] 
L:  Wow, how long were you, uh, there?
R:  We --
L:  I mean, how long have you been here.
R:  I -- my husband was raised in San Diego and I lived there for six years --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and then we moved here seven years ago.
L:  Oh, so you've been here for a while.
R:  So, yeah, sometimes I really miss the [NOISE] [SIGH] I don't know, the convenience and the ethnic food and --
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  -- the [NOISE] -- [MN] it's kind of nice when nobody knows you.  You know, this small town we're in, [SIGH] [NOISE] you know, is just like a big gossip machine. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, so it's really small?
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, it's pretty small.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, [NOISE] it's, like, a thousand people. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, [SIGH] yeah, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you don't miss the earthquakes, though, do you?
R:  [LIPSMACK] [MN] Uh, no, no, but --
L:  [LAUGH] Did you ever experience one?
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, I did, [SIGH] I did.
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I just felt like the bed was shaking, [NOISE] I was in bed at the time. [NOISE] I'm a nurse and I was sleeping during the day --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- 'cause I had worked nights, you know. [NOISE] 
L:  Right.
R:  And I just thought the bed was [NOISE] shaking and it was, uh, the earthquake, but we didn't have [NOISE] and damage or anything.
L:  Mm, [MN] [NOISE] 
R:  But actually the town that I'm living in is [SIGH] Barneveld, [NOISE] which made, like, national news [SIGH] probably fifteen years ago f- with, uh, tornadoes. [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] Well, actually, the town I'm living in now also --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- about eleven years ago --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- had a big tornado.
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] funny.
L:  Also on TV and, yeah, it was a big thing. [LAUGH] 
R:  Not funny, but --
L:  [SIGH] so, when I left the city, I thought, "Well, it's either the crime or the tornadoes, which one do I want?" [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, really.
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] So, it -- yeah, we get pretty nervous when there's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- storms out here.
R:  [NOISE] I bet.
L:  But, [SIGH] yeah, it was eleven years ago, yet --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- a lot of the, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  --people -- um, some of the --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  --people -- um, parents that my boys play baseball with, that have lived here for a long time were telling me, [SIGH] like, where they were when it happened, how bad it was and everything.
R:  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] So, that's something --
R:  Were people --
L:  -- I don't want to experience, that's for sure.
R:  Yeah.  were people killed? [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, well, there -- the school was --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the high school was hit and there were kids in there, like, grabbed their school stuff [SIGH] and I know a couple died --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and, um, I don't think there was, like, a big amount of people, but there was a big amount of damage. [SIGH] But I know that there's some of the kids in high school died.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Wow. 
L:  And, um, they --
R:  Sad.
L:  -- rebuilt that high school, where my kids go now and, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it's [MN] -- it's really growing out here, though, so they had just built another high school too --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and I think they're going to build another one next year 'cause it's --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- [SIGH] too --
R:  It's Plain -- Plainfield?
L:  Yeah, it's just, um --
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] 
L:  -- it used to be all farmland and --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- there's -- they're starting to develop everything so you can get a house still for a lot cheaper than you can, you know, other places.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But it's really, really growing, uh, Plainfield and all the [MN] areas around it, so 
R:  [SIGH] Are you, like, an hour from Chicago, then?  The downtown? [NOISE] 
L:  Now, actually I'm only, like -- I'm probably, like, forty minutes, forty five minutes from downtown.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah, it's really not -- 'cause it's, um, [LIPSMACK] really easy, it's one shot --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I'm right near the expressway, so you just get on [NOISE] [SIGH] one expressway and straight there, so --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- I mean, unless you hit traffic, which you usually do.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  You know, but [SIGH] if there's no traffic, like, if you go during the day --
R:  [SIGH] [NOISE] 
L:  -- like, in the middle of the day or something, yeah, I can be there -- 'cause my husband --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- works downtown.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, uh, do you work, then?
L:  [LIPSMACK] I do, I work at night, though.
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  I work for, um, FedEx--
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- but I work nights, so that --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I'm here during the days and --
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  -- he's home at night with the kids, yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  [LIPSMACK] But he works downtown, he takes the train and it doesn't take him -- it's not too bad [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and when he drives, it's -- it's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um, it's probably, like, an hour drive for him because he's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- in traffic.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But it's not too bad.
R:  [NOISE] Huh.
L:  Yeah, so, we still have --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I mean, we can go into the city any time we want.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And my family all live in the city too, so we're there a lot.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, wow. [NOISE] 
L:  Mm.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] It was my sister that told me about this, I don't know how she found out, though. [SIGH] And so I might as well [LAUGH] [NOISE] --
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, I didn't think they'd even call me back, I'm kinda surprised --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that they even called back.
L:  Well, I didn't -- yeah, w- after the -- you mean after the first time?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, 'cause --
L:  Yeah, 'cause I -- I hung up. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, me too, [NOISE] so I just figured, "Oh, they just move onto the next person". [NOISE] 
L:  Right, so did I, so 
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] And I also didn't they'd call me 'cause I didn't give 'em my social security number.
L:  [SIGH] Oh.
R:  But my friend who referred me to this said she didn't give 'em hers either, [SIGH] although she hasn't been paid yet, so we'll see.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, 'cause that's why I thought they needed it, but 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm sure they'll -- they'll get it from you somehow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If they're calling you for --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] I don't even know how -- how oft- like, how they pay you, like, how often do they do it, or ? [NOISE] After ever call, or ?
R:  [NOISE] I think she said you have to make ten, or you have to make five ten minute phone calls and you get ten dollars per call.
L:  Okay.
R:  So.
L:  So, they wait till you get the five of 'em.
R:  [SIGH] I think so, I don't know for sure, I could be misunderstanding it, but I think [NOISE] that's what they told me, so you end up with [SIGH] fifty dollars after the end of the five calls. [NOISE] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] It's not that bad of a deal.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] It's kind of a --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- crazy kind of thing, but [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, I don't understand, you know, I'm sitting here thinking --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- "Now, what are they looking at, what are they [SIGH] listening to with our conversation?" [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah, is, I suppose we're -- I don't know if we're supposed to t- I thought, too, [MN] my sister also said --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it's not a big deal if you don't talk [SIGH] about the subject, like, if you just mention it or whatever, so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, so I don't know what they're looking for exactly.
R:  Huh.
L:  [LIPSMACK] But, hey, you know, I'm just sitting here doing nothing so I'm [SIGH] --
