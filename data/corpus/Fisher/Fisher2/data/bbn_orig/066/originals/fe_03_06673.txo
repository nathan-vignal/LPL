L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Hello. [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] Hello.
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] Hi, this is Carolyn, who's this?
L:  I'm Dorothy.
R:  Yeah. [SIGH] They call -- uh, actually my name's Roberta, they call me Bobby, too.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, that's [MN] --
R:  So, Bobby's fine.
L:  Yeah, Bobby's fine.
R:  So, uh, where are you from?
L:  Bloomington, Illinois, at --
R:  Bloomi-, where?
L:  [SIGH] Bloomington, Illinois.
R:  Oh, Bloomington. [SIGH] Okay, so what are we, uh -- uh, what are we talking about here?
L:  [NOISE] Health and fitness.
R:  Uh, yes.
L:  Do you exercise [LAUGH] regularly? 
R:  [SIGH] No, I don't.
L:  Oh, well, you know, it makes you feel good.  I, uh, did until, [SIGH] oh, December. [SIGH] 
R:  Oh, what happened?
L:  I had surgery. [SIGH] 
R:  Oh.
L:  And, um, it takes a while to get over that. [SIGH] 
R:  Oh, dear.
L:  Then we went to New York City for a week, and I got enough exercise to last me for six months. [SIGH] 
R:  Oh, what, walking around?
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah, did you like, uh -- Atlantic Ci- uh, where -- where --
L:  New York.
R:  -- you said New York City?
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, but I wouldn't want to live there,
R:  No.
L:  [SIGH] It, uh, was an awful lot of walking.
R:  [SIGH] Oh, I understand.
L:  Because, uh, we [SIGH] either went by subway, [SIGH] and if you went by subway you were going up and down steps and running to catch the trains. [SIGH] Or we went by bus.
R:  Oh, [SIGH] [NOISE] I see.
L:  But, you know, I get up every morning, I ride my bicycle.
R:  I -- oh, okay, what kind of [MN] [NOISE] -- yeah, what -- tell --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- tell [NOISE] me about your bike.
L:  It's just -- just a stationary bicycle.
R:  Oh.
L:  And, um, I -- every morning I get up and say, "Well, I'm going to get back to walking".
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] And you know how far that goes? [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah.  No, I understand, I understand.
L:  And how about you?
R:  [SIGH] Oh, I -- I do, uh -- I do some walking here and there. [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  Uh, I -- I [MN] usually, uh, you know, walk around the track.
L:  Yeah. [MN] 
R:  That's about it.
L:  [SIGH] See, that's -- when I walk, I usually walk in the neighborhood and then we have what they call a constitution trail here --
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  -- which is a walking --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- trail.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH] And you can walk all the way around the city.
R:  [SIGH] Ooh, h-
L:  You could get --
R:  -- how many miles is it?
L:  [SIGH] Oh, I w- don't know for sure, but I'm sure that it covers eight or ten miles.
R:  Oh.
L:  [SIGH] And it's something that is all paved --
R:  [SIGH] [MN] Oh, okay.
L:  -- and --
R:  It's -- it's how many miles did you say?
L:  I think it's probably eight or ten miles, I don't know --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- for sure, um --
R:  Uh [LIPSMACK] --
L:  -- [SIGH] the city is about sixty thousand people --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] but, uh, you could get on it and you can either -- you can ride a bicycle --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or roller skate, [SIGH] anything except motorized vehicles.
R:  Oh, I see, I see.  Is it [MN] wide, or is it ?
L:  Mhm, it's, uh, probably three people wide --
R:  mm.
L:  -- and some of it goes through [SIGH] residential district, right in front of people's houses.
R:  Is that right?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [SIGH] Do they like that or no?
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, I do because I like -- and then --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- uh, I like to walk where there are other people.
R:  Mhm.
L:  There are some --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- sections of the walking trail that are pretty [SIGH] remote.
R:  Oh, is it?
L:  You know, there's, um -- it goes under a bypass and out around the, um, general electric park --
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  -- and behind [inaudible], but it's wooded --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and --
R:  And there people can jump out and --
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, there have been a couple of people attacked on --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that trail.
R:  Oh dear, [SIGH] oh dear.
L:  But, you know, we all know the good things we're supposed to do.
R:  Yes.  No, I understand. [SIGH] So how's the -- did you exercise -- how old -- how old are you?
L:  Seventy two.
R:  Yeah, [SIGH] so have you exercised all your life?
L:  All my life.
R:  Oh, mhm.
L:  From the time I was a little kid.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  How about you?
R:  Oh, I -- I [MN] -- I go into spurts.  Sometimes I [SIGH] do a lot of swimming, sometimes I [MN] don't [MN] --
L:  Well, you're getting there.
R:  -- depends on how -- how busy, [SIGH] uh, things are, how -- how motivated -- I don't know, sometimes I'm motivated, sometimes I'm not.
L:  Well, you sound pretty young.
R:  Uh, well, I'm fifty two.
L:  Oh, well, that's young.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, so. [LAUGH] 
L:  I have children that age. [LAUGH] 
R:  But I, uh -- I, uh, uh -- I know, uh -- I know exercise is very important, it's not like I -- I discount it, but I [SIGH] don't do it as much as I should, I guess.
L:  Well, I think we all are that way, you know, you know you're supposed to be out there exercising. [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah, I think my mother would have lived till she was a thousand years old, the only thing she did [SIGH] was, uh, not, um [NOISE] -- uh, well, she smoked.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] And, uh, that's what killed here, 'cause she was very, uh, active and always walking and stuff, so --
L:  But how old was she?
R:  [SIGH] Uh, seventy six.
L:  Oh, my mother lived to be ninety eight.
R:  Oh, yeah, [MN] and her mother did not smoke and lived to be about that age.
L:  Yeah, no, see, my --
R:  So, I'm sure if she didn't smoke she would have still been with us. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.  I do not think my mother ever consciously exercised, but [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- she always had a big garden --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and I -- you know, housework and all that stuff.
R:  Well, they didn't have the appliances that they have now.
L:  No, you're right.
R:  I can remember my mother bringing up clothes from [SIGH] -- uh, and hanging 'em in the yard.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, yeah, we did too.  We had to pump the water when I was a kid.
R:  Did you?
L:  Yes, we we- had to go across the street to my grandmother's property, pump the water, take it home, [SIGH] put it on the stove, heat it --
R:  [NOISE] Oh dear.
L:  -- so, you know, we didn't have to think about exercise.
R:  [SIGH] No, it was already built into, uh -- in- into the, um --
L:  Into the -- [MN] into --
R:  -- into living.
L:  -- survivi- into surviving.
R:  Into living. [SIGH] So, uh, how many calls do you get on this, or do you, um -- uh, how many calls did you make?
L:  This is the first one.  They have called me a couple of times, but it just was times when I wasn't at home.
R:  [SIGH] Oh, I see.  Well, you can call them you know.
L: Yes, I know, that's what I did today.
R:  [SIGH] 'Cause then it's --
L:  [SIGH] I tried yesterday but the, uh, topic yesterday was, um, [LIPSMACK] censorship --
R:  [SIGH] Okay.
L:  -- [SIGH] and I thought that could be very controversial.  I didn't want to [SIGH] get into something quite like that.
R:  Um, the -- I guess you don't have to do it, you can just wait for --
L:  No, because --
R:  -- another day.
L:  -- they -- you dial in, they tell you what the topic is and then ask for your number.
R:  Oh, okay, and then -- yeah, they could do it that way too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  My sister did it, and so that's why I'm trying it now.
L:  Oh, see that's -- I had a friend who did it and it's easy ten dollars.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They -- I wonder how many times you can keep doing it?
L:  Three.
R:  Oh, three times.
L:  And that's all, but -- but [SIGH] in one place they say you can do three [MN] times, in another place it says you can do [SIGH] five calls up to twenty five if you have five different phone numbers.
R:  [MN] You have to have five different five numbers?
L:  In order to do twenty five.
R:  Oh dear.
L:  But I --
R:  But what if you have -- what if you have the -- the same person living in the house and [SIGH] has --
L:  I --
R:  -- the same phone number?
L:  I don't know how that would work, probably --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- not. [SIGH] But I spent thirty years of my life talking to people for a living.
R:  [NOISE] Oh. [MN] 
L:  So, I thought, "Well, you know what?" [LAUGH] 
R:  You're exercising your jaws, then.
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] Yeah, and it didn't pay me ten dollars then. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, you in just- were --were you a re- uh, a researcher or something?
L:  [SIGH] No, I answered the telephone in a large hospital.
R:  Oh, oh. [SIGH] Oh, I guess, [MN] you know, uh, they can't really give out information any more.
L:  [SIGH] I know.  I retired a year ago and it was getting that way then.  I think they've gone a little nuts on the privacy.
R:  Mm.
L:  [SIGH] Where are you from?
R:  Uh, well, I'm around the Philadelphia area, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh.
R:  A little bit further than you.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I mean, this is up north, I guess.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, oh, no, where the -- I just love where I'm at.
R:  [SIGH] Mm, Bloomington, right?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Where do --
R:  How far are you away from Chicago.
L:  [SIGH] Uh, two and a half hours.
R:  [SIGH] Mm, I've never been to Chicago, I understand that's a lot of fun.
L:  Well, I don't know. [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] Have you been there?
L:  I've-- I've been through Chicago a few times.  I have no desire to be in a big city.
R:  Mhm.
L:  The one we're in you can get any place in fifteen minutes.
R:  Oh, in your place.
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh. [NOISE] 
L:  And everything -- there's nothing --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that we don't have here.
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE] 
L:  I mean, it's very, uh -- it's a white collar community, it's the home office of state farm insurance.
R:  Oh, is it?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, I didn't know that.
L:  So, the largest number of people here --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- work for state farm.
R:  Ah. [NOISE] 
L:  Which makes it very white collar, very affluent.
R:  [SIGH] Oh.  Oh, I see, I see, uh-huh. [MN] 
L:  And, you know that state farm encourages all their --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- people to be healthy.
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] And they want their, uh [SIGH] -- uh, that's why they have these, uh, walks and stuff I guess.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Oh, I see.
L:  Well, when I worked -- the hospital I worked at had them.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Um, at one time, we had a contest to climb Mount Everest.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [MN] Counting the steps, you know, in the hospital.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Hospital steps.
R:  [SIGH] And how many steps was there -- were there?
L:  I -- I don't know, but there were a hell of a lot. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I would guess so.
L:  [MN] [SIGH] I did it and I [LAUGH] think I spent half my time [LAUGH] walking up those stairs. [SIGH] You could walk up --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and you could walk down.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] But you couldn't take the escalator.
R:  [SIGH] Oh, oh, [SIGH] and --
L:  I -- I suppose you could take the escalator up and just walk down.
R:  [SIGH] But that's still, uh -- that's -- that's -- and so did [MN] -- did -- how long did it take people to do it? [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] I don't know.  I would go out and do it on my lunch hour and on my breaks --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and it took months because it was thousands and thousand of steps.
R:  Oh, I'm sure. I -- to climb, uh -- yeah, well, you got to figure, yeah. [SIGH] There was just somebody I heard on the news that did it, um, [SIGH] in ten hours, it was a Sherpa.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And, uh, that's unheard of to do it that quick.
L:  Well, see, they had, uh -- one of the kids in dietary -- a young kid in dietary did it in just a short time, but [SIGH] he was probably seventeen years old and he was out there running up and down those steps.
R:  Oh, okay, so he did it real quick, then?
L:  Yeah, the rest of us didn't.  You had a certain length of time --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- to get it in.
R:  [NOISE] Yes. [NOISE] 
L:  And when I got to my last -- I don't know how many thousands of steps you had to do, when I got to the last one, I quit.
R:  [SIGH] Did you?  Ah.
L:  And, um, there were a lot of people that walked more --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [SIGH] but I think --
