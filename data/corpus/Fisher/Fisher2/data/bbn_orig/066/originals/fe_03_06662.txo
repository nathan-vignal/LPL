R:  Hi.  My name is Susan.
L:  Hi.  My name's Sherri.
R:  So, do you exercise?
L:  [LAUGH] not nearly often enough.  
R:  [LAUGH].  Well, uh, have you -- have you done this before?
L:  No, this is the first call.  
R:  Okay.
L:  I just signed up for it, like, a day or so ago.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I was surprised that they called already.
R:  Yeah.  Me too.  Well um, I do try to exercise.  I live out in the country and -- and we have some dirt roads out here --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so when it's raining, it's not really good for exercising.
L:  Right.
R:  But um, I try to go for a walk a couple of times a day, at least a mile or so, but I haven't been able to do that lately --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because I've been too busy.
L:  I grew up out in the country and I used to love to walk out in the country, but I live in an apartment now in town and there's not really any nice places to walk.  It's all paved.  
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH].  
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I'd love to have some --
L:  But I do, I walk my dog --
R:  -- paved roads.  [LAUGH].
L:  -- around the sidewalks, around the blocks.  I walk her every day for at least, I'd say, maybe thirty minutes or so.  Um, at least once a day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, and sometimes she gets another twenty minute walk besides and I actually went so far as to buy some exercise equipment, um, and I use it maybe twice a week.
R:  Oh, what kind of equipment do you have?
L:  It's uh, Body by Jake.
R:  Uh-huh?
L:  It's uh, got these resistance bands on it.  And you --
R:  Okay.
L:  It's got a padded seat you sit on --
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  -- and it's about things -- you can do leg presses or you can push it with your arms or with your legs.  
R:  Oh, okay.  Is that hard to do?
L:  Um, not really hard.  Actually, you're supposed to not have so much resistance on it that it's hard.  Um, so that you can do all the reps.  [NOISE].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, what was that?  
R:  I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Was that the end?
L:  Oh, I know what that was.  That was my answering machine.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH].
L:  I didn't get up to turn it off when the phone rang.  
R:  Wow.  Um, yeah, I don't have any exercise equipment, but uh, I don't know where I'd put it if I had any.  [LAUGH]. 
L:  [LAUGH].  Mine's sitting in my living room so I remember to use it.
R:  Yeah.  Uh, so do you do that for health or fitness, or do you just do that for fun?
L:  Well, I -- I do it because I'm so out of shape, I need to do something.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].  So you're doing it for health and fitness?  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, yeah.  
R:  Yeah.  Well, um, I had a -- a wo- a wonderful situation there from about nineteen eighty to nineteen ninety one --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- I've -- I walked -- first I walked to the bus stop which was about a half a mile.
L:  Mhm?  
R:  And took the bus downtown to work, and then on my lunch hour, I might get to go out for a walk, so at least I got a mile uh every day for five days.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  And then I walked to the grocery store.  I didn't bother to drive, 'cause it's -- you might as well uh just get out and walk, as close as it was.
L:  Right.
R:  Takes longer to get there by car.  So I [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- I just did that and then I got a job that was just a little under a mile away from where I live --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and I walked there every day and back, so I got two miles every day.
L:  Wow.
R:  And then uh, my boss uh he suggested that I start walking home for lunch.  I don't know why he suggested that, but I said, "That sounds like a good idea".  I really liked him, so I did that.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  And then so I got four miles a day for a long time.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  For about ten years.  Most -- most days.
L:  Did he give you some extra time on your lunch hour, if you have time to walk home and eat?  [LAUGH].
R:  Well, I didn't -- I didn't eat much lunch, so --
L:  Oh, uh-huh. 
R:  -- it wasn't -- you know, I went home and checked my mail --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and uh got my bills paid, petted my cat and then came back.  If the weather was bad, of course, I didn't do that, but --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  -- anyway, I didn't have to think about exercising because I got my exercise just going to work.
L:  Right.  
R:  So I would love to do --
L:  That was good.
R:  -- that 'cause it -- it's hard to get motivated --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to do exercise if you don't have to go --
L:  It really is.
R:  -- somewhere.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Now we're out in the country and I -- I just really have to push myself.
L:  Right.  That's where I like to walk the best.  I like to walk -- I suppose you don't get as brisk a walk because you're stopping and looking and -- and especially --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if you're walking in a wooded area --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you can't really keep up any speed.
R:  Yeah, when the -- when the geese are flying over or --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, I try not to look up there and -- [LAUGH].
R:  When you see deer go by.  [LAUGH].  
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, yeah, lots of deer at my mom's house.
R:  Yeah.  What part of the country are you from?
L:  Um, Southern Illinois.
R:  Okay.  Is that -- I'm -- I'm in the middle of central Kansas, so I don't know --
L:  Are you?
R:  -- if it's similar.
L:  I'm, um, about twenty five miles east of St Louis, Missouri.
R:  Okay.  Is there a lot of woods there?
L:  Ah, there is at my mom's, but not where I live.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.
L:  I live in a -- kind of a middle sized town, I guess.  It's probably got about thirty five thousand, I guess.  It's not a big town, but bigger than the one I grew up in.  That's probably about -- more than twice the size of the one I grew up in.
R:  Oh.  Well, so you're a small town --
L:  Actually, I didn't even grow up in it.  I grew up outside of it, out in the country.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I think it had about fourteen thousand.  
R:  Oh, well that's --
L:  Might have fifteen or sixteen now.
R:  -- not small.  That's not small.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  The nearest town to us has about twelve hundred. 
L:  Yeah?  Well, we were exactly halfway in between that town and then a little tiny one.  Actually, they called it a village and I think it had six hundred at that time.  I think it might have nine hundred now.
R:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  But you know, those towns are really nice to walk in.
L:  Yeah.  They are.  Very nice.  Not --
R:  Like --
L:  -- all that busy traffic.
R:  Yeah, not very much traffic and usually a lot of trees and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And the streets in this -- in the town near us are so wide.  I don't know why.  Either they must have been driving combines down them or something --
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- because they're just, like, twice as wide as your normal city street.  
L:  Yeah, that's true.  I think I'd probably walk more if I co- could find somebody to walk with me, if I had somebody to talk to.  My -- my dog listens really well, but she's not much of a conversationalist.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  Do you have a boyfriend or a husband or anything?
L:  No, none of the above.  I've been divorced twice actually and it's been --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I guess twenty three years since I -- since my second divorce, almost twenty three years.
R:  Was either one of them interested in -- in activity or walking or anything?
L:  No.  My first one, his -- his idea of exercise was twelve ounce cans.
R:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.
L:  And he -- he was fond of saying anytime he felt like exercising, he lay down till the feeling went away.
R:  Well -- or if he had to, he'd walk to the refrigerator, right?  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  Right.  Well, no, he'd actually -- he wasn't uh home to walk to the refrigerator.  He was usually at the enlisted club after he got off duty. 
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah, so --
R:  Oh, no wonder he didn't want to exercise.
L:  Yeah.  Well -- 
R:  He probably had to.
L:  -- that's why I left him when my son was only two.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH].  Oh.  Well, I've got a -- a husband who uh introduced me to jogging.  I never thought about jogging until --
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- he came into my life and that's --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- what he always used to do, so I tried it for a while and did real good.  I was able to get five miles in three times a week.
L:  Wow.
R:  And then we had the ninety three floods and we got flooded out here practically and --
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Uh, and the streets, everything was just mud and -- and wet and there was no place to run or walk or anything, so I got out of --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- the habit and after that,  I didn't ever take it up again.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause it's hard on your knees and on your feet, too.
L:  Yeah, I'm -- and I'm so much overweight that there's just no way I can jog.  I have to do something that's almost no impact.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].  Me, too.
L:  Because my -- my knees have about had it anyway.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  Too many years of carrying too much.
R:  Yeah.  But you know what, I noticed, um, that -- there was a time when we were applying for another life insurance policy and we had to get a physical uh, um, exam.
L:  Mhm?
R:  And my blood pressure was way up, and here we were in the doctor's office and, like, we couldn't get my blood pressure down.  I'd never had that happen before and uh, I was kinda worried about it and then I was going to the chiropractor and I was real scared of the chiropractor 'cause I -- I didn't --
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- know what he was going to do, and -- and they started checking blood pressure on everybody and -- any my blood pressure would be up when I was there, too.
L:  'Cause you were stressed, maybe?
R:  But -- well, I guess I had white coat uh -- you know, white coat high blood pressure syndrome.
L:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH].
R:  And [LAUGH] so I got me a blood pressure uh monitor and started checking my blood pressure at all different times of the day and -- and when things -- certain things happened and stuff and uh this was at a time when I hadn't been walking for a while.
L:  Right.
R:  And so I started walking again and it really -- it brought my blood pressure down.
L:  Wow.
R:  It brought that bottom number down by ten points, just getting my -- my walks in every day.
L:  Wow.  
R:  So --
L:  I need to --
R:  -- I know that works.
L:  Yeah.  That's a good idea.  I need to start making my walks a little bit longer every day before the weather starts getting hot so that I'll be more used to it.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  My dog -- I have a Siberian husky, so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- when the really hot weather comes, she's not going to be wanting to walk very far.  [LAUGH].
R:  No.  
L:  And not on the hot pavement.  [LAUGH].
R:  No.  [LAUGH].
L:  Right now she's still blowing her coat.  She's --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  It's coming out in chunks, that undercoat.  
R:  Oh.  Do you shave those or do you just let them --
L:  No, no, no.  Never.  Because --
R:  Let them shed --
L:  -- they're -- they have -- they're double coated and --
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- um even -- they lose most of their undercoat in the summer, but they still retain some of it in that -- that double coat, just the same as it insulated them from the cold, it also helps to insulate them from the heat a little bit.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Because it -- it keeps their body temperature um -- the undercoat holds their body temperature at an even temperature.
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  And then the guard coat protects the uh -- the guard hairs protect the undercoat.
R:  Oh, that's interesting.
L:  So yeah -- but it's -- yeah.  They don't -- and they don't get real long hair, you know, it's um -- it's maybe two or -- two and a half, three inches, maybe some of the guard hairs are and then the undercoat's maybe an inch, about an inch and a half.  
R:  So --
