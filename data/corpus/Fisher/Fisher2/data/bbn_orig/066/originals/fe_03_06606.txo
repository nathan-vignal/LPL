L:  Hi this is Karen. 
R:  Hi Charlene. 
L:  Hi Charlene.  [LAUGH] I didn't hear all of the questions? 
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Oh.
R:  Where you -- where are you -- where are you from? 
L:  Um, I'm in Phoenix.
R:  Oh, okay I'm up in Canada. 
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, we are -- do we agree that they should have to read certain books?  Is that what it said?
R:  I think it was in the public or private schools --
L:  Right.
R:  -- do you think they should be allowed to, um, forbid the kids to read certain books. 
L:  Oh, I see.  Okay.
R:  That's how I read it.
L:  Okay.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  Yeah I think that's what it was.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, um, --
L:  How do you feel about it? 
R:  I would think -- I mean definitely in the private school I mean if it's a private school that's their prerogative right --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to be able to -- I mean that's the point of a private school they can do what they want, it's their funding isn't from the Government or from you know the city or anything like that so definitely in that sector I think they should be able to you know put what they want to read I mean whoever is sending them there the parents have that choice not to send their kids there.
L:  Exactly -- exactly.
R:  So definitely not, um, in the public -- god -- I mean I -- I definitely think there's books that should kids shouldn't be reading.
L:  Yep. 
R:  So I would -- I would think that there -- the school and administrative should have some say on what books could not be in the library -- I mean within reason obviously but I don't know.
L:  Right.
R:  What are your thoughts? 
L:  Well I'm -- I'm kind of wavering at my children's elementary school.  I just wanted to look at it for a simple book on an -- on an artist and I can't even remem- -- can't even remember the name of the artist [LAUGH] off the top of my head.
R:  Yep.  
L:  But they did a lot of, um, [inaudible] -- no wait that wasn't it -- but any way it was -- they did a lot of, um, nude women from Tahiti.
R:  Okay.
L:  And in his paintings but that's not the painting that, um, I'm involved in this art program at this school and we present different pieces of art that they should -- that are very tasteful and everything --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but on the information that I looked up, um, on just a simple getting to know great artist, master piece artist's and they keep those in the school library, this one shows a couple of questionable pictures.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  But they didn't -- they kept it off to the side for the teachers to be able to check out.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And, um, it's -- and so I -- I don't think it would be really bad if a child got its hands on it.
R:  Right. 
L:  But then again it also could be could be not so good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know so --
R:  I mean it depends on the child too and what, even if he's there with a bunch of friends or what they're looking for -- what you know but yeah that's true it's a good idea to have them where the teachers have access to them because I mean like you say you should be able to access that one at some [inaudible] person and other stuff is tasteful and you know for history or whatever.
L:  Right -- right and I did check the book out and used it in my presentation, I just covered up the pictures.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's right yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  So --
R:  Yeah well especially I mean --
L:  I think in elementary.
R:  Exactly as I was going to say in elementary I mean things are -- kids are exposed to so many more things way earlier that I mean for sure in the elementary stage there should be some censorship of what books aren't available to the kids and different like things like that.
L:  I agree I -- I agree there for sure.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I like it when the teachers make available the list of what the children are going --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- to read.
R:  That's true because then you know what it is and yeah.  But I mean each family, I know for us we have Christian beliefs and so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there would be some things that I would maybe even know that the teacher maybe thinks is fine, I maybe would have questionable things with certain parts of what they're reading and if I knew what they were reading and can read ahead of time I can sit down with my child and talk about it. 
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah I think that's good to know what they're reading and give out the list to and stuff to -- yeah but I mean each family is different what they allow their children to read and stuff.
L:  Right.
R:  But --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like movies.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So if you're in private school you can do what you want.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If you're in public school then I believe we have to basically let the administration --
R:  Yeah use their [LAUGH] --
L:  Right cause it's a government thing.  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly -- yeah.
L:  But, um, --
R:  But there should definitely be some sort of -- you know control over what's happening there as well and you know that you know it's not just like oh Miss Librarian can -- can put whatever she wants in her library without you know checking with anyone and here she's got some crazy things putting in her library you know.
L:  Right but then again like my son is in a -- a, uh, a program at his school and, um, I didn't see that they were reading this one book and it was about, um, a black child in the sixties.
R:  Right.
L:  And how this, um, Christian family with I believe four other children -- no five other children had brought this child to their home, he's a minister and, um, and how the people in the community and even the church people, um, treated the whole situation and -- and there were some words in there that I had already explained to my children you know that these are inappropriate and this is how it was but that was also history and -- and for them to learn about it and so I was okay -- I would of liked to of read it ahead of time.
R:  That's right aye.  [LAUGH]
L:  But, um, but because there was some questionable things in there I can see where some people would of might, um, might of said, "Oh, no they shouldn't be reading this, this is -- this is inappropriate".
R:  Yeah.
L:  Although it was with a small group of children because it's one of those gifted programs.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So -- so they -- they do have the ability to do a little bit more --
R:  Stuff -- yeah.
L:  Right and a little bit more advanced reading.  Not mature reading because they're not just -- because they are exposed to more doesn't make them more mature but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a little bit more advanced reading with heavier topics so -- and -- and it --
R:  Definitely I think keeping the parents informed of what the kids are reading and what's there I think that's the key thing because yeah I mean the parents should be able to make decisions too and be able to interact with the children about those books and --
L:  Right.
R:  Exposed to and stuff like that.
L:  Right and you probably do and I do, but that's probably most problem of people that aren't involved and then jump the gun --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and say [inaudible]
R:  Exactly.
L:  You can't have this book you hear that's degrading to --
R:  Yep. 
L:  -- you know our culture or whatever how we were you know raised or you know that's not how it is anymore but that's not what it was about, it was learning about compassion and sacrifices and that kind of thing so.
R:  Yeah that's true some people tend to jump the gun and don't have all the facts either.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  [LAUGH]
R:  But yeah most definitely there needs to be -- I think yeah censorship is a good thing and there should be -- sometimes there should be more of it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Probably so cause, um, I'm -- I'm starting -- you know I'm trying to think of different things of what I definitely would not want in a school --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and --
R:  What ages are your children?  Do you mind?  Mine just starts kindergarten next year.
L:  Oh, mine eight and ten.
R:  Oh, okay -- yeah.
L:  And, um, and I know that we have to sign particular permission slips and what not so that they -- they can access Internet but without --
R:  Right.  
L:  -- you know -- any harm you know with no -- no harmful side effects.
R:  Oh, right. 
L:  So -- so and it's basically just for research.
R:  That's right yeah.
L:  But, um, I certainly wish there was more censorship in public libraries.
R:  Yes.  
L:  Because with the, uh, computer access anyway there can be censorship because I've heard many bad things about children walking around libraries and people are in there accessing anything they want on the Internet.
R:  Anything they want -- yeah.  [COUGH]  
L:  And so that's where I really wish as far as book and libraries.
R:  That's right with more there.
L:  In a public situation so --
R:  [inaudible] [COUGH] I always forget to look what time it is and I start -- because I always think [inaudible]
L:  I know.  [LAUGH]
R:  And then you get more questions sometimes it's like you run out of things by ten minutes.  [LAUGH]
L:  I know the last survey I did was -- we agreed there was nothing to debate about really --
R:  No.
L:  -- and we're okay [LAUGH] --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- so now what are we going to talk about and are we going to get paid for this if we --
R:  I know that's what I was asking -- wondering too, but have you done numerous of them or 
L:  Um, I think we're only supposed to be able to do three.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  This is my third one.
R:  Yeah this is my third one too.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah curious what will happen after we get paid.  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  [LAUGH]
R:  It's been kind of fun though so that's okay.
L:  It is -- it is -- it's been fun so I think they'll keep us on their list for something else.
R:  That's right.
L:  But I -- I guess it has to do with voice recognition.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Of something like that right -- of doing some kind of voice recognition project.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So well I -- and -- and --
R:  [inaudible] [LAUGH] 
L:  Right and is it pretty strict in Canada censorship there? 
R:  Um, --
L:  In schools or don't you know yet? 
R:  See I don't really know because I'm just starting to go to school and so I'm -- yeah I'm curious it will be interesting cause to find out what it's like and what -- I mean I know with censorship on movies it's quite different from even province to province.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  The ratings and that stuff's been interesting too but you know schools yeah I don't know, it will be interesting
