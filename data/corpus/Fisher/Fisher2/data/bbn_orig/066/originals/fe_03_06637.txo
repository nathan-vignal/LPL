L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, my name's Michelle.
R:  Hi, my name is Laurel.
L:  Hi, Laurel.
R:  [LAUGH] Hi, how are you?
L:  I'm okay.  I guess --
R:  Okay, --
L:  -- our --
R:  -- so I guess --
L:  Our topic of the day, I guess, is censorship.
R:  Yeah. Did you go to private or public school?
L:  I went to -- I went to a -- a public school and, then my kids went to private for some time.
R:  Okay,
L:  Mm.  Yeah.
R:  -- so, -- I went to, um, private school, so basically, we had a lot of things during the week, where they would talk about censorship, and the topics of the books would be put up on the shelves and, you could look to see what everybody else can read and we could.  [LAUGH] so -- so what do you think, ah, -- what do you think about it, just in general?
L:  I think there's a lot of books I don't want my children to read and, I would have no problem with the school saying they couldn't.  At this point in time, they just -- they let them read so much stuff and I have a ten year old and a fifteen year old and, there's just things I don't want them to be able to have access to, and they can't have it at -- at home, but the schools'll let them have it.
R:  Are there -- are there any particular topics?
L:  For my kids?  I don't think they need to have the, like, the love stories that are explicit, --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and I don't like them to have the gangster type things and, they're allowed these things at school.
R:  Okay.  What ab- -- well, what about things like, um, like, with Maya Angelou, and stuff like that's been, ah, told  -- a lot of kids can't read those in schools because of the topics, but a lot of the times, even though there might be the topic of something, maybe, that's sexually explicit, at the same time it also has to do with issues like integration and stuff, and do you think it's worth sacrificing having something that is considered to be monumental in terms of presenting issues taken away because of a fraction of that book?
L:  Well, I'm not quite sure that there's a necessity in putting -- I mean, if you want -- if, if -- and I know who -- who you're talking about, with Maya Angelou, --
R:  Yeah, --
L:  -- if, um, if a point needs to be made, I just -- I don't understand the necessity of putting in things that are sexually explicit or -- or outside the -- the confines of morality, you know what I mean?
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- because we're raising kids.
R:  Okay, I ju- -- I'm, I'm really young, so I don't have any kids yet, so my perspective might be skewed [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, I'm thirty five.  I'm --
R:  But, um, at the same time, I think that, looking at literature from, um, being in college and stuff now, that my perspective is that so many of these books that you're reading, it has to do directly with the times, like, Freud, for is- -- for instance, and his theories on homosexuality and how, um, he theorized that basically, you want your, um, somebody who's exactly like your mother or your father, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that, now, like, for the times, is extremely terrible and people think how could you -- how could anybody desire what is considered to be your mother or father, but, at the time when, um, Freud came out, it was originally thought then that even men and women -- it was just women are -- it's, you have the same sex organs except for -- they're internal?
L:  Mhm, I -- I remember that from college.
R:  -- yeah, so -- so then, do you think it is really -- do you think to not present those issues what you want or what you wanted that you should, it's really that those things should -- your kids should be older?
L:  I think the kids should be older.
R:  Just older?
L:  You know, or, I'm -- I'm one of those old-fashioned moms that fight for morals with my children, I'd rather my kids end up, you know, staying virgins and staying healthy and wholesome and all of that, all the way through their lives until they're getting married and you start -- I don't know, I -- [MN] having a fifteen year old daughter, especially one -- my -- my fifteen year old looks really, really cute, she's a cheerleader, and --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] -- she fits -- she fits the cheerleader mould perfectly, long, blond hair, and everything, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I -- I mean, I see how the boys react to her, and I see how she's questioning things, and I -- I just don't think that you need to bring too much sexual topics into the schools, you know, that, I think the, ah, stay abstinent, stay pure, is all right and, then you get these books that say, oh, but, here's  what happened, and here's what you want to do, and -- that's a bit much for me.  I guess I'm just too old fashioned, because I was back in the time when health was about health and we didn't read about sex.  If it said sex, it wasn't in our school.
R:  So, but then, do you hold the same perspective to be with just the media in general, do you think that -- wouldn't you think that if you take it away from r- one aspect, like, books, then aren't you going to have to take it out of your mainstream media, and eventually, it might -- it might be seen as being just overprotective in general?
L:  Only in schools.  You know, if -- if she's watching something here at home, that's up to us to decide, but, in the school systems, I don't think they have a right to judge what's okay and what's moral for a child, that's -- that's -- each and every family's, you know, decision.  But, at the same time, we live in a culture that, they don't care about morals, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and when w- -- and when we talk about someone like Maya Angelou, I didn't read anything --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that, you know, from her, and I've seen -- [SIGH] well, Oprah, ah, -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- plastered her all over the place.  Um, I -- I just, I can't see that little old lady putting anything in a book that I don't think would be appropriate, but I don't know, I haven't read it.  Um, when I was a kid, it was Judy Blume --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the book Forever.
R:  Yeah, and, like, the, ah, wasn't there -- there's those mystery books, there's a woman.
L:  Well, Judy Blume wrote a book called Forever and, I just recently saw it back on the shelves at Target, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I picked it up, see, that was a book that I got in big trouble for when I was fifteen.
R:  Mhm.
L:  No, that's fine, just fill it up.  I'm sorry, --
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  -- um, and, ah,  I saw it back on the shelves and I picked it up and, I went, huh, you know, just, kind of like, "Look at this", well, my fifteen year old grabs it and she opens right to the center, and she's, like, "Mom", and I said, "Put it up".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, you know, of course, she wants to read it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Now, that's my censorship.  I'm saying, "No, you can't read it", and she turns around and said, "Oh, I'll just get it at the library, then".  She can go to her school library and get something that talks about a man and a woman, a man and a sixteen year old, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I have a problem with that.
R:  Okay, so, then -- do you think that a same should apply for both public and private schools, where there should be some sort of system?
L:  Well, private schools, typically, at least in this state, are Christian.  They're run by Christian organizations, they are not regulated by the state, and when my kids were in private school, oh, my gosh, they were clamped down on.  Their history was not about the history of the world, it was history of the Bible, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, we didn't talk about anything in their history class, and I felt that was too sheltered, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- whatever happens in a private school, I figure, you're paying money to send your child there, you ought to know what's going on.
R:  Mhm.
L:  If you don't like it, you pay to go a different school.
R:  You.
L:  -- but the public, we don't have a say in what happens in public schools.  You know, I think that they're way too liberal.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I think, I'm not just talking censorship in books, I'm talking censorship in movies, what they decide to teach the kids in fourth grade, and -- you know, because that's when the big sex topics come out, in fourth grade, now, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, ah, music, what I won't let my kids hear at home, they can hear at school.
R:  Yeah, do you -- there is actually, um, on the news the other day, there was something about how the age of kids becoming sexually experienced has now -- it's moved to younger, --
L:  Fifth and sixth grade.
R:  -- to around age -- to, like, fifteen, I think they said.
L:  Fifth and sixth grade they're starting to talk about sex, now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  My daughter's in fourth, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, she's not sure what some of the kids are saying and she'll ask me.
R:  Yeah.  So, you -- and, but you would rather, much rather that your kids come to you to ask, anyway?  Are you still there?  Hello?  It wasn't ten minutes.  I hope she didn't hang up.  Hello?  Do you think she ended the call?  With, like, thirty seconds left?  [LAUGH]
