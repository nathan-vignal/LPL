R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, I'm Tania.
L:  Hi, I'm Mary.
R:  Hi, Mary.  Um, [SIGH] I guess our topic today --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- is health and fitness. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yes. [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] Do you like to exercise?
L:  [SIGH] Well, um, I like it more than I used to. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] I wish I did.
L:  Um --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, I -- I started exercising regularly probably, um, [SIGH] last -- the end of last summer.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] What --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what kind of exercises do you do? [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Um, walking and, um, Pilates.
R:  Uh-huh, um, [SIGH] yeah, I'm -- I'm not -- I don't like exercise all that much, but I -- my -- we bought a treadmill which I don't -- my four year old uses --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- more than I do.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] And, um, I've been using it, like, and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- one of those big blow up --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- exercise balls [SIGH] and --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- I found I -- I enjoy that a lot --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- more. [SIGH] So --
L:  I've -- I've been wanting to get one of those too [NOISE] to try one out, but --
R:  Oh, I highly recommend it. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] It's, uh, not -- it's not a lot of stress on your body [SIGH] and it's, uh, [SIGH] more -- it's funner. [SIGH] My daughter likes to get down on her little play ball --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and do the exercises with me. [LAUGH] [SIGH] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Do you have kids? [MN] 
L:  Yes, I have three kids.
R:  Oh, yeah? [SIGH] [MN] 
L:  [NOISE] And, uh, they -- they do my, uh, exercise video with me --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- or try to anyway. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, it's fun to watch 'em. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah. [SIGH] but, uh [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH] But -- yeah, that's why I like the pilates is because it doesn't, um, put stress on joints or anything.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And [NOISE] I have a hip problem --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [NOISE] uh, painful hips.
R:  Uh.
L:  So that's why I -- [SIGH] if I don't do my pilates regularly my hip pain comes back, so --
R:  Yeah, I have a, um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- my problem, I had back surgery a couple of years ago [SIGH] --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- and I found when I don't exercise, it -- it gets real stiff and sore and I end up having more problems. [SIGH] That's funny, it's, uh, [SIGH] your body --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- telling you you need to exercise, [LAUGH] I guess. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah, that [NOISE] -- that's right. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I [NOISE] -- I haven't lost a whole lot of weight doing the [NOISE] exercises, but, um [NOISE] I'm stronger, so [NOISE] I guess that's --
R:  Yeah, that's about where I'm at. [SIGH] [MN] [SIGH] So, I -- we bought the treadmill, I -- I s- told my husband, "Yeah, I'll work on it every day".  But, of course, I haven't [SIGH] and --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- don't lose the weight that way. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Are -- are you trying to lose -- lose weight?
L:  I would like to lose weight, yeah. [MN] 
R:  Yeah, so am I. [SIGH] How much are you trying to lose?
L:  [SIGH] Um --
R:  If you don't mind my asking, [LAUGH] I'm sorry. [SIGH] 
L:  Well, [SIGH] I -- I guess I'm not really sure I -- what I would be happy with.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Probably at least forty pounds.
R:  Yeah, I was going -- I'm going for at least fifty, so [SIGH] that's -- I know where you're coming from [LAUGH] I guess.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] It's, uh --
L:  [SIGH] You don't -- I don't know if I -- [SIGH] I -- I was down that much before and I -- I was -- I wasn't exercising at the time and I wasn't happy --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- where I was, but it -- I -- you know, now that I'm exercising and have more muscle tone --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] maybe I would be happy with that, I don't know.
R:  Yeah, maybe be happier just knowing that you worked to get there, [SIGH] if you've been --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  -- 'cause I know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I -- I think if -- once I'm able to lose the weight, [SIGH] you know, it's -- it's kinda like someth- you know, you give your kids something, once they learn how to -- if they have to earn it, they take care of it better, [SIGH] I guess.
L:  [SIGH] That's true.
R:  [LAUGH] So, I think if I -- if we, uh -- if it's something that you're really working towards then [SIGH] it's something --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that you'll take care of and appreciate more, I guess. [SIGH] which makes sense to me.
L:  Well, that's true.
R:  [LAUGH] So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Uh [SIGH] --
L:  Um, trying to remember what the other part of the --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- questions were.
R:  Suppose -- there's a-- mhm.
L:  I guess there was [NOISE] do we en- we enjoy it, and I -- I guess [SIGH] I can't say I really enjoy it all that much, but, uh --
R:  Yeah, I don't -- I don't enjoy exercise in general, but it's -- [SIGH] I -- I kinda like doing the exercise ball, it's -- I think it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's, uh, not as tedious as, [SIGH] uh, and boring as ri- walking on the treadmill. [SIGH] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] Right, yeah, the treadmill is pretty boring, I've -- I've done that before.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But I guess I -- I -- the exercises I d- [NOISE] you know, I enjoy it more than I used to, but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I guess I enjoy the benefits of the exercise [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [NOISE] much more than the exercise itself. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [SIGH] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  It's too bad we can't just hook up -- hook our bodies up to a machine and [MN] it does the exercise for us --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know. [SIGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  They used to -- they used to have those, um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] they used to claim that you know you could stick those --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- little sticky pads and it did the exercise while you slept or [SIGH] sat --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- you know.  Too bad those didn't really work. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I know what [MN] --
R:  [SIGH] [MN] 
L:  Yeah, I -- I actually knew some people who [NOISE] -- who tried that.
R:  Oh, really? [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't know if they [NOISE] -- they never really said much about it, so it must not have, [NOISE] [LAUGH] you know, been --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- successful, but --
R:  Yeah.  Well, now they're advertising the same things [MN] but they're just calling 'em, um, deep massage units or something like that, so it must not have worked. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  So --
L:  I haven't heard of those again. [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] So [SIGH] -- yeah, what -- what, um -- what other kind of hobbies do you have? [MN] 
L:  [SIGH] Um, I -- I like to, uh -- I -- I like to take pictures --
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  -- and I'm an artist, [SIGH] um, sewing. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, uh, yeah, that's neat. [SIGH] Uh --
L:  What about you?
R:  OH, um, I do, um, crocheting, sewing, reading, [SIGH] anything indoors that isn't [LAUGH] too active --
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
R:  -- [SIGH] Um --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I give, uh, [SIGH] uh, I do --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, do my coupons and stuff like that. [SIGH] I don't get out --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- much 'cause I have a visual problem, but [SIGH] --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- um, I have a [SIGH] -- a retinal disease, so I don't -- I don't -- can't drive or anything, [SIGH] but, uh --
L:  Oh, that would be -- that would be hard.
R:  Yeah, it's -- we live with it. [LAUGH] [SIGH] But --
L:  [SIGH] Well, yeah, you always do what you have to do.
R:  Yeah, yeah, and I figure as long as I'm -- I, uh -- if I can't have that I can at least make -- you know, I exercise to keep my body better, so [SIGH] at lest I don't have to strikes against me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So [SIGH] -- so you said you have three --
L:  Well --
R:  -- kids? [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah, and --
R:  How old are they?
L:  [SIGH] I have a, uh, almost eleven year old, a --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- six year old and a two --
R:  Oh, yeah.  So --
L:  -- year old.
R:  -- I have a four year old, [SIGH] who just turned four. [SIGH] So 
L:  Yep, I -- they -- that's -- that's so- another reason [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- why I -- I want to --
R:  -- keep after them. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- stay healthy.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  So, yep.
R:  Yep, that's a --
L:  You got to be able to keep up with them and [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they want you to play ball and --
R:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- or whatever --
R:  And that's --
L:  -- ride bikes and --
R:  -- exercise in itself. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yep.
R:  Yeah. [SIGH] [MN] 
L:  Yeah, I guess another thing I do is ride bikes, or ride bikes with my kids. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  We live out in the country, so we --
R:  Oh, that's neat.
L:  -- can ride all around the -- the country.
R:  Uh-huh, oh, that's neat, that's -- [SIGH] we need -- we need to get a hold of bikes. [LAUGH] We, um, moved last year, we moved [LAUGH] -- actually bought our first house, so we hadn't -- [SIGH] we had -- we had moved cross country from Texas, um, now we're in California [SIGH] and, um, we, uh, [SIGH] sold our bikes 'cause we just couldn't afford to ship 'em --
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  -- so we -- [SIGH] and we haven't bought any new ones, so [SIGH] we're look- we're looking into it, though, we're going to see, 'cause that's something --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- fun that I think we could do. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah, it's fun to do as a family.
R:  Yeah, [SIGH] yeah.
L:  For us, anyway.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. [SIGH] [NOISE] 
L:  And I -- I don't know if you've heard of, uh, the Burleigh trailers?  Bicycle trailers?
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah. [SIGH] 
L:  But we -- we have one and I highly recommend it.
R:  Oh, yeah? [SIGH] Huh.
L:  I put my two year old and my six year old in there --
R:  Huh, yeah.
L:  -- and we go and, uh --
R:  Yeah, [SIGH] yeah, we had thought about getting some kind of trailer and -- and -- well, for my husband and I, we'd get a, um -- a -- like, two seater bike [SIGH] because my --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- uh -- because of my vision, I can't ride a bike by myself, but we'll get a --
L:  Right.
R:  -- get a two seater bike and then put a trailer on the back of it, [SIGH] so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] so my husband can steer and [SIGH] we can [SIGH] all go along. [SIGH] And they've also -- I've -- there's, um -- there's -- I -- we read something in this, um -- [SIGH] you, uh -- it's like, a [MN] little bike that attaches to a big bike, but it doesn't -- it doesn't have a front wheel, [MN] and it lets the li- the kid steer --
L:  Yeah, the --
R:  -- and peddle.
L:  -- alley cat shadow.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, something like that, yeah. [SIGH] We're really kinda --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- looking into that too, but we're also looking at having more kids, so we think a trailer might be better. [SIGH] So [LIPSMACK] that way we can [SIGH] -- if we have another baby we can take the baby along too. [SIGH] 
L:  Sure.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah, and babies lo- uh, mine -- mine did [SIGH] [MN] -- just loved riding in there.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  So [SIGH] [NOISE] --
R:  Mhm. [SIGH] Hm.
L:  [NOISE] But yeah, I -- I -- I researched them a long time and --
R:  Did you?
L:  -- uh -- and the [NOISE] Burleigh [NOISE] [MN] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] yeah, there are some that are a lot, lot more expensive than that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, um -- and -- and I suppose they might be better, but, uh, the Burleigh for the price, uh -- f- you know, in that price range was definitely --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the best.
