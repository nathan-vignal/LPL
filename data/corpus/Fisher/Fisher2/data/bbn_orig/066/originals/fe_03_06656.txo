R:  My name is Kim.
L:  Hi, Kim.  Uh, my name's Jan and I'm calling from uh Pittsburgh.  Where are you calling from?
R:  I'm in Ontario, Canada.
L:  Oh, wow.  Um, I'd like to discuss with you fitness and exercise.
R:  Okay.  
L:  And do you exercise?
R:  Um, not on a regular basis, no.
L:  Well, that makes two of us.  I try to.  Um, part of my exercise is walking my dog.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I try to do that every day.
R:  Right.
L:  But she has a problem right now with her legs, so she's taking Aspirin for arthritis, so she doesn't really want to go every day, so now I need something to give me incentive to keep doing that.
R:  Oh.  Mm.
L:  So and the other thing I do, um, I work in my yard a lot.
R:  Right.
L:  I have a big lard -- yard.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I cut grass.  And of course, plant flowers, especially now.  So what do you think would be incentive for you to exercise?
R:  Probably having someone to go out with more so.  Like, someone to do exercise things with.  You know, like whether it be walking or going out somewhere, you know?  
L:  To a spa?
R:  Um, like -- or like nicer weather, you know?  Like going -- being able to go outside and do nicer, like, weather things.
L:  Absolutely.  I think the weather has a lot to do with it.
R:  Mm.
L:  Um, as far as I'm concerned, I used to belong to a spa --
R:  Right?
L:  -- and I found it too expensive.
R:  Yeah, that is quite expensive there.  Yeah.
L:  So I bought myself a machine that I exercise with sit-ups --
R:  Right.  That's good.
L:  Yeah, and it's tough.  You --
R:  Right.
L:  And it's tough to do it on a daily basis.  Again, it's almost like you need someone to say, "Hey, get on with that exercise".  You know?  
R:  Oh, definitely.  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH].  And uh, so do you do any -- do you use any equipment at all?
R:  No.  Mostly I just go -- I've seen another guy, walk around with -- I'm in the university setting, so I have to walk to all my classes and stuff and in nice weather, you know, it makes you get the bus and stuff, I walk or -- and if it's nice, I'll walk instead of taking the bus or that sort of thing.
L:  Walking is one of the best exercises there is.
R:  Mm.  Definitely.
L:  I -- my daughter, uh, started walking at least two miles.  She tries to do it every day --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- and honestly, she uh -- she -- it amazes me.  She ver- very rarely misses.
R:  That's great.
L:  Uh, mostly weather.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  But she's lost over thirty pounds.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  It's amazing to me.  She just started doing this, uh, last fall.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And she even went in the wintertime.  She just dressed appropriately and she works every day.  She works regular -- you know, forty hours a week.
R:  Right.
L:  So it amazes me --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- that she did fit this into her schedule.  I think once you have a routine --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if you would do it on a daily basis, even if you just go one mile a day and build it up maybe a mile and a half --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and make yourself go at a certain time, I think it really helps.
R:  I think so, too, yeah.  You know, you gotta keep it up and stuff.
L:  Oh, absolutely.  That's the only way it'll work.
R:  Right.
L:  And even with that machine I have, it's -- it's not a comfortable machine so I don't even recommend equipment.  My daughter has equipment but she's done so much better just walking and I think that's a fantastic way to lose weight.  And of course --
R:  Well, that's great, yeah.
L:  -- of course you gotta watch what you eat, too.
R:  Right.  [LAUGH].
L:  I think that [LAUGH] that -- do you watch what you eat?
R:  Yeah.  Mo- most of the time I try and eat a balanced meal.
L:  That's wonderful.
R:  Or if I don't eat, like I get one of those, like, um snack bars, you know, with all the -- the uh nutrients in them.  It's not like a chocolate bar or something like that.
L:  That's wonderful.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I do the same.  I try to watch what I eat, but then I'll bring candy into the house and --
R:  Oh, no.  [LAUGH].
L:  -- and that's all it takes, is one piece.
R:  Right.
L:  So I really try to avoid that.  I had it here at Easter time and well, what I did was take some to work so I wouldn't eat it all and it -- basically you really have to watch what you eat.
R:  Right.  Definitely.
L:  That has a lot to do with it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  They say you are what you eat.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  And I am a bread eater.  I lo-
R:  Oh, I love breads and like pastas.
L:  Do you?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, you're bad.
R:  And nothing on the, uh, meat eaters.  I'm not a big meat eater.  I don't like meat very much.
L:  Well, I eat meat, but not a lot.  I like fish, too.
R:  Yeah.  I eat mostly like chicken and stuff.  I very rarely eat meat.  I don't like --
L:  Exactly.
R:  I don't like steak or --
L:  Huh.
R:  I'm not big into that.
L:  Well, I love steak, but you know, that's a rarity.  I only get a good piece of steak, I go to Outback --
R:  Oh, Outback --
L:  -- Restaurant.  [LAUGH].
R:  -- [inaudible].  We have that here, too.
L:  And we only do that maybe once a month, not even that often.  More -- more like every about six weeks.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah, but uh, basically I eat a lot of chicken.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I love vegetables and fruits.
R:  Right. 
L:  And salads are fantastic to me.  I love salads.
R:  Yes.  Salads are pretty good, too.
L:  So if you eat like that, I guess -- you're probably not heavy to begin with?
R:  No, I'm not really, no.  I'm actually just --
L:  [LAUGH] I --
R:  -- about average.
L:  Neither am I.  I'm -- I'm -- I've maintained a weight of between one twenty four and one thirty --
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  -- all my life.  I mean, since teenage years.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  But I've been very healthy that way and I owe it all, I think, to doing exercise.
R:  Right.
L:  And keeping --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- busy and eating right.  And uh, fortunately I don't -- I'm not a person who has to worry about weight.
R:  Mm.  No.  [COUGH].  I can be most of the time, if I don't get out enough, like, in the winter time.
L:  Yes.
R:  I find my weight goes up a bit, but then in the summer, it goes back down.
L:  Well, do you also feel sluggish when you do gain that little bit of weight?
R:  Um, sometimes, yeah, because of the weather I think.  It's just yucky and you know, you just don't want to do anything and --
L:  Well, that's when you have to kinda give yourself a better outlook, huh?
R:  Mm.
L:  Throw a coat on, get out there and breathe some fresh air and take a little walk around the block.
R:  Right.  Definitely.
L:  If you can.  Yeah, that -- that means a lot.  But you need a friend to do that with.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I would agree with that, yeah.
L:  And I'm sure if you're in school, you have a lot of friends you can talk into going with you?
R:  I don't know.  Um, it seems most of my friends don't -- don't live in my area, so --
L:  Oh.
R:  They live about -- like, further out.  So it gets a little harder at times.
L:  Oh, I'm sure that -- yeah, that does make it difficult.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I'm the same way.  I -- I miss -- when I take my dog, I meet a lot of people who are walking.  Maybe you need a dog.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  Yeah, maybe.
L:  No, it's just -- it -- it does give you an incentive, whether it's an animal or a friend.
R:  Mhm.
L:  To help you get out there and do some exercise.  
R:  I think so, yeah.
L:  And swimming, you know, now with swimming coming up --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, the pools have opened, but we need the warm weather and that's another thing I love to do.  Um, I do the swimming exercise classes in the pool.
R:  Right.
L:  Have you ever done that?
R:  No, I don't like the pool -- I don't like swimming.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I really don't like swimming.  It's a fear of the water, really, that I have.
L:  Oh.  Well, honestly, when you go in the water, just to exercise, it might be an incentive for you to learn how to swim.
R:  Maybe, yeah.
L:  You -- to get over the fear of water.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because when you go in the water and it only comes up to your knees, you can still do exercise in that water and it makes such a difference.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  You can feel it, uh, pulling on your legs, your leg muscles.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's a very good exercise class.
R:  Oh, wow.  I'll have to try that.
L:  Honestly, it feels wonderful and they teach you how to relax in the water, just floating.
R:  Oh, nice.
L:  And see, if you would maybe learn how to swim.
R:  Mhm.  Maybe more relaxing, too.
L:  Oh, it is.  It's wonderful.  It feels so good.  You get out of the -- I exercise for an hour.  Now, I haven't -- I did that in the winter.
R:  Right.
L:  And they run, uh, exercise classes in the indoor pool and you feel so good when that hour's up.  Your whole body, it just feels wonderful.  And I miss that, now.  You know, you can still do it during the summer, but I didn't sign up for the summer ones yet.  I might.
R:  Right.
L:  But yeah.  But anyhow, it's a lot of fun.
R:  Oh, that sounds really good, yeah.
L:  Now, how do you pass up ice cream?
R:  Um, I don't -- actually, I'm not a big ice cream eater.
L:  Wow.  See, you like all the good foods.
R:  Yeah.  I'm not really into ice cream, so [LAUGH].
L:  Well, do you eat fish?
R:  No.  I don't like fish.
L:   Well, are you a vegetarian?
R:  No.  
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  But I like some --
L:  So you do --
R:  -- fish.  I mean, I'm -- I like some -- with me it's like -- actually, it's probably the --
L:  The chicken?
R:  -- meats that aren't good for you, like I like hamburgers and hot dogs and, you know, pizzas and like stuff on -- on the pizza and bacon, but I don't usually like, you know, pork.  I --
