R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, my name is Summer.
R:  Summer?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, pretty name. [LAUGH] 
L:  Thank you. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, my name's Jacqueline.
L:  Jacqueline?  That's a beautiful name too.
R:  Mhm, and I'm in Michigan.
L:  Cool, I'm over in Washington.
R:  In Washington?  Well --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I've been getting people all over.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Uh, I'm sure you probably have too.
L:  Well, I've actually only answered one call.  I missed one when -- the other day, and it [SIGH] --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- so, I've only -- this is my -- the third time they've tried to call and the second I've actually been able to answer. [SIGH] 
R:  Okay.
L:  So. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, this is my third time.  They -- I did miss 'em on the Friday because I was out --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- [SIGH] but, anyway, our topic is health and fitness.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay, I, um -- I'm -- I'm -- I do exercise, I walk, [SIGH] I ride the treadmill and I do whatever I can to keep in shape. [SIGH] 
L:  Oh, that's very wise. [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, I do that, and I eat right.  I try to eat right, the only time I really grub is, like, on holidays.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I just try to walk two miles a day, you know, when I'm out there --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and then if I'm riding the treadmill, I try to do that forty five minutes a day, but you know, I -- I'm a firm believer that, you know, you -- you got to keep your body in shape.
L:  That's true.
R:  You got to --
L:  [SIGH] That's true.
R:  -- keep your body in shape, and I'm not doing it -- taking no, um, pills, [LAUGH] you know, some people take diet pills --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and all that stuff [SIGH] to maintain their health.  Well, me, I just try to eat right, eat the right food --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [SIGH] then exercise and make sure, you know, that I -- I get it in, because if I don't [MN] maybe in -- you know, in my middle age I will start putting on a few pounds and I don't really like that 'cause my clothes don't fit right.
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH] But I just really do believe that people should keep +themselves in shape whether they like [LAUGH] -- you know, want to or not, because I believe that the reason why a lot of -- we're having a lot of heart attacks and different things like that 'cause some people just not in shape.
L:  That's true, that's true.  People [SIGH] are very either misinformed or [MN] unmotivated --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- which is, um, very sad. [SIGH] I, myself, um, am not in shape, [LAUGH] um --
R:  Oh, you're not?  Okay.
L:  I -- you know, I go through phases where I really want to be --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] and, um, right now I'm in the midst of one where I want to be, but [SIGH] I'm bored with what I used to do to be --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in shape and so [LAUGH] -- 'cause I just -- I've gotten to where I don't like to do things that seem pointless, even though exercise itself is not pointless --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I really need to have a goal to work towards to stay motivated to do it well --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] and so I've been trying to be more creative in the last few weeks, and trying to figure out ways to be active and [SIGH] like, um, one -- one thing that I did last week that was really a lot of fun was actually just working in my mum's yard [SIGH] --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- um, with my -- between -- things that have happened, she had a tree cut down and the guy didn't take the branches and the grass grew up high so you couldn't mow the lawn and [SIGH] -- and they were all tied up in the grass and stuff, and that was actually really fun for me to [SIGH] spend a couple of hours ripping all the branches out of the grass [LAUGH] and --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [SIGH] and then, um, my brother in law's put up a new roof on her house and left a big mess on the other part of the yard and [SIGH] so I cleaned that up and that just felt really good to just be outside and [SIGH] sweating and, you know, pulling -- you know, picking things up and [SIGH] -- and, um, you know, just cleaning up.  I really liked that and, um -- [SIGH] 'cause my brother in law came back yesterday and was [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- finishing the job so --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [SIGH] I don't have to do that any more --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [LAUGH] although there are some weeds still to pull in the front so I think I'll do that and I thought -- I saw a few shrubs and trees that I'm going to rip out 'cause they are being -- they're so overtaken by weeds that they're nearly dead anyway [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um -- so it's kinda crowded where they are so I was going to take those out so [SIGH] that'll be one way that I'll enjoy actually exercising and [SIGH] yesterday I forgot that it was memorial day [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and, um, I went and parked my car at my church which is kind of in [SIGH] the downtown of the city I live in and I walked [SIGH] all around downtown and ended up, you know, well, in a place called -- we -- we call it the circle [SIGH] and it's literally this road that goes around this little park [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and there's, like, the post office and the library and everything and [SIGH] I walked up there and [MN] just to find out that the library was closed and [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [LAUGH] so, um, I walked around the park and then I walked all back to my car and [SIGH] that was fun, I stopped at a little coffee shop on the way and got a -- a chi tea and [SIGH] and so that -- you know, it was kind of fun it was -- it -- I had a purpose and [SIGH] so, like, today I've been kind of lazy and [SIGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- 'cause I'm try- trying to plan a party for Friday and so [SIGH] I've been trying to -- I've [MN] put it off until this week so --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- [SIGH] that -- this -- I've spent all day, you know, getting some things ready for the party, but I think tonight I'm probably going to -- [SIGH] 'cause we have ch- a church service tonight, I'll probably park my car at the church and [SIGH] you know, go early and walk over to the library and hang out at the library for a little bit and then go to church and [SIGH] --
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  -- then it's -- then I'm -- I know I'm exercising but I have a purpose that I'm working towards right now [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and -- 'cause that's just really how I am.  I think it's really important to stay in shape, I've really been [SIGH] trying to change how I eat lately [SIGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, like eating more vegetables trying to eat --
R:  Mm. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- organic --
R:  That's good.
L:  -- and, um, that's -- I really like that, it's actually -- it's forced me to become more creative [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, and try not to put sugar and salt in my food and [SIGH] so that's, um, made me have to learn how to use herbs and other ways to -- [SIGH] to flavor our foods and stuff and [SIGH] so that's actually given me another purpose which is really fun [SIGH] and --
R:  Oh, that -- that's really good.
L:  [MN] Yeah, so I'm --
R:  Yeah, I do --
L:  -- I'm enjoying -- I'm enjoying trying to get healthy --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] instead of just, you know, killing myself to wake up at the crack of dawn every day and do aerobics --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] you know, which I hate doing and I [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and [LAUGH] it's miserable the whole time, it's better for me to try to be creative and find [SIGH] projects [SIGH] that I can actually see something positive right now. [SIGH] 
R:  Oh, that's [MN] good, that's good.
L:  So.
R:  Well, you know, I do aerobics, but what I try to do is I try to change mine.  I don't do aerobics all the time, [SIGH] I'll do aero- well, one time I was doing tae bo and -- oh; you know about that? [SIGH] [MN] 
L:  [SIGH] I haven't tried that out that, I --
R:  You haven't heard of it?
L:  -- my friend has a video, I need to borrow it.
R:  Yeah, well, I've tried, but, you know, you -- [LAUGH] you got to be careful with that, I got to kicking and [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- I don't know if I kicked something out of my knee and I --
L:  Oh, no. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I mean, my knee hurts.  Well, yes it did, [LAUGH] it +hurt for, like, two or three months, it might have been longer than that, [SIGH] and I said -- so I kinda stay away from aerobics unless it's low impact [SIGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, right now and stuff like that, so I get out, I walk more and like I said I might jog a little bit, but most time I do the treadmill, I ride the bike, or, you know, you -- sometime, you know, you have a partner too, that helps, you know, somebody to walk with you and talk with you and then, you know, you walk farther than you want to.  Sometimes I get my daughter, but sometimes you don't cooperate --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- she likes to do her exercise, she's got all these exercise tapes, so she's got different ones for different things, so she'd rather stay in -- in a -- inside and do that, but [SIGH] me, I can exercise inside but largely I kinda like to be outside, like you -- like, I don't like going in the same way, like, walking the same way every day, I usually make sure I do something different --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or walk in a different way so you have a different environment and, yeah, sometimes we -- we got a walking trail not too far from our house and -- and I'll walk on that sometimes and, you know, just trying to do everything [LIPSMACK] I can to stay fit 'cause I know if I don't -- [SIGH] if I don't eat right, well, see, once you start getting your middle age, you don't eat right you could tell the difference, you know, like, when I eat, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- fruit and vegetables all the time, [SIGH] I, um -- you know, I feel better, but when I sit there and eat all them starches [SIGH] and all the pizza and y- all this, you know, bad food stuff --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] you know, my -- I -- my body can tell, you know, the difference, just -- but, you see, I'm [inaudible] and I've been eating right all the time, so I'm not stop and start doing that, my body would let me right -- know right away, "Uh-uh, you can't --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- do that".  You know. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  "You can't do that".  So, you know, I go back -- 'cause I love vegetables, I love 'em, you know, and I'll sit there and I -- I can eat a salad every day of the year.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Everybody don't want to believe that, but I can, 'cause you --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] you tell me about two -- two times out of a week, people are tired of it, but I can get a salad every day.
L:  Well, yeah, but you can make it different every time.
R:  I do.
L:  I mean, you can add --
R:  I do, I put it all --
L:  -- sunflower seeds or --
R:  -- that'll be my meal.
L:  -- [SIGH] or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- cheese or some eggs for you're your protein, your [SIGH] different dressing, you can, you know, add different kinds of vegetables, I mean, [SIGH] you can totally make a salad so different every time and --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- [SIGH] yeah, I agree with you, you could totally not get bored with salad.  I love salad, I crave it and --
R:  Oh, you do too?  No, my body -- I think my body craves it more -- you know, too, [SIGH] and like a lot of my friends they are, "You make the best salads".  I say, you know, "If you all want me to make you all salad, just say so, because you all aint got to try to flatter me.  I'll make you all salads".
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
L:  And then they're telling everyone else, and they say, [SIGH] "I heard you make a good salad".  I'm like, "What?" [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] 'Cause --
L:  [SIGH] You do.
R:  -- I think some people -- when they eat salad, I think they eat -- only might put dressing on there and they might put lettuce and they might have maybe [SIGH] a carrot -- you know, some carrots cut up in there [SIGH] or tomatoes, see -- and then that's the salad, well, see, me, I put everything in my salad.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, coleslaw, I like -- you know, I've quit using lettuce because it's got no nutritional value, it's almost all water [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but cabbage is really good for you --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so I've been making my salads with cabbage and --
R:  Mm, I haven't thought about that.
L:  -- it gives it different -- it gives it a different texture and also it doesn't wilt as quickly as lettuce does.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, if you make a great big huge salad on Sunday, [SIGH] you know, you can eat it all the week long --
R:  Oh, well.
L:  -- and you don't have to feel bad 'cause you're feeding yourself vegetables [LIPSMACK] and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you're supposed to eat that many vegetables, but [SIGH] yeah, you can totally put any vegetable you want in there and it doesn't even have to just be vegetables, I mean [SIGH] --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you could even, you know, throw some apples in there for some sweetness or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] you know, like I said, find different protein things and throw 'em in there, you know, some nuts of some sort or [SIGH] [NOISE] something so it's a meal, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [NOISE] 'cause you can't just eat -- I mean, you can just eat vegetables but eventually --
R:  Right.
L:  -- your body's going to crave protein. [SIGH] 
R:  Right, that's why --
L:  So.
R:  -- what I do, I usually put, like -- I put -- I don't put ham, I don't eat ham [inaudible], put turkey and chicken and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- or I might eat fish on the side, you know, and it al- there's always a meat or a -- you know, something like that on the side, I don't eat it by itself [SIGH] see, but I like to put raisins, like you said, and [SIGH] apples [LAUGH] and, uh, [LAUGH] uh, let's see, what else do I put in mine, um, I put some tomatoes in there sometimes, I'm not really a big tomato fan.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I put cucumbers in there sometimes, I'm not a big fan of them either, but I have eggs and I also have cheese.  Now, if I can get -- [SIGH] those four right there, that -- that's fine with me, you know, then maybe I might put some croutons in there or either [SIGH] sprinkle the, um, sesame seeds, you know, I mean, I -- I mean, I do it up. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] You know, and --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- everybody, like, "Oh".  But ranch is my favorite salad dressing, it's my --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- favorite, I could eat ranch every day, too.
L:  Oh, uh, you know, I got sick of ranch.  When I was in high school I ate it on everything and [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and ever since high school I haven't liked it and [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I -- if I'm being -- if I let myself have a treat, a treat to me is blue cheese, but the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the -- the creamy dressings are so high in fat and I don't like low fat dressings, I --
R:  Mhm.
L: -- don't think they taste very good, [SIGH] so --
