R:  Hi.  My name is Geri.  Who am I speaking with?
L:  Hi.  My name is Lois.  How are you, Geri?
R:  Hi, Lois.  How are you today?
L:  I'm pretty good.  [LAUGH].
R:  Okay, thanks.  Um --
L:  Have -- have you done this before?
R:  Yes.  I did it, like --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- oh, about a year ago.
L:  Oh, okay, 'cause I never have.  It's something --
R:  Yeah, it's very interesting.  I mean, I was talking to somebody all the way from Arkansas yesterday.  He couldn't believe I was from Philadelphia.  He said, "My goodness, that's a long way from Arkansaw".
L:  [LAUGH].  No, it would take a lot of health and fitness to walk to Arkansas.
R:  Yeah, it sure would.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Where are you from?
L:  Well, I originally am from Philadelphia --
R:  Really?
L:  -- but right now -- yeah, we're up in Montgomery County right now.
R:  Oh, is that where you're at right now?
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. 
R:  Okay.  I'm baby sitting at -- my daughter is in Jersey, but I live in Philadelphia, South Philadelphia.
L:  Oh, good for you.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  But I think we all need to exercise a little bit more.  I know I do.  I try --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- to walk as much as I do, 'cause I don't drive, so --
L:  Oh.  Okay.
R:  -- but I don't get -- you know, I'm not into any type of like really exercise program like, um, an aerobics class or doing some exercise to tapes or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- anything of using any type of uh exercise equipment, but I do an awful lot of walking, so you know, but I -- you know, I should.  My daughters are all into exercise.  One of them belongs to a gym.
L:  Mhm.
R:  The other one does, like, um the tapes painfully three times a week.
L:  Oh, that's great.
R:  Like, she's been doing it, like, for thirty something years.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Oh, she -- you know, God forbid, the world would end if she didn't exercise.  She's --
L:  Oh, I wish I had that attitude.
R:  -- so --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, she's so self conscious about you know gaining weight.
L:  Yes.  Yeah.
R:  And she says 'specially now that she's getting older --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- you know, her metabolism isn't the same as, like when she was young.
L:  Sure.
R:  And you know, she's really, you know, um -- really gung ho, really, about it.  How about yourself?  Do you just --
L:  Well, um, I used to be, when I was a young mother.  [LAUGH].
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  I used to exercise with Gloria Dear.  You remember her on television?
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And Jack Lalane[?], and I was --
R:  Oh, Jack Lalane?  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Gosh, I mean, that's dating myself, but uh --
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  -- I was really into it back then, but then when you get the responsibilities of two little kids --
R:  Oh, I know.  It's so hard --
L:  -- and dogs and a house --
R:  -- to do that.
L:  It is.  And --
R:  And my daughter works and she has two small children, but she finds time to go to that gym because --
L:  Well, that's terrific.
R:  -- she loves to eat.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you know, there's time when, you know, she don't always watch what she eats and then she has to go to the gym to work it off and her husband, he works out constantly.  He, you know --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- lifted weights and --
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  Oh, he is really into fitness.
L:  Wow.  Wow.  [LAUGH].
R:  And uh, yeah.
L:  I wish I were.
R:  But it is -- you know, it's very beneficial for your heart, you know --
L:  Oh, definitely.
R:  You know, your whole system, let's say your circulation.
L:  Sure.
R:  And they say that people who exercise [MN] for a lot of years will never get osteoporosis.
L:  Right.  That's true.
R:  So that's another thing, you know, that's beneficial to that.
L:  That's right.  Yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I don't want to ever get that.  That sounds kind of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- painful.  [LAUGH].
R:  I know, I know, that's terrible.  I mean, but exercise is really so good for you.
L:  Oh, it is.
R:  And they say it can become very addictive.  Once you're used to exercise and, like, you don't want to go without it.
L:  I think it's true.  It does make you feel -- you just feel up and -- and --
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  -- pepped up after you finish, you know?
R:  Right, and I said to my daughter, "God, aren't you exhausted, I mean, after a hard day's work --"
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  "-- coming home and going to the gym for an hour?"  
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  She said, "Believe it or not, mom, it makes me feel more energetic".
L:  Is -- and -- and you have -- she has children too, right?
R:  She has two small children.
L:  Wow.  That's wonderful.
R:  So I come here and I watch them.  In fact, she's going to the gym tonight after work.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I have a full time job myself.
L:  Oh, my heavens.
R:  So I'm usually here, like, on my two days off during the week, to help her out, but sometime her husband's off one day so I get a break.  Like, lately --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- he's been -- but I used to come -- God, um, the whole two days for, like, my granddaughter is, um, seven years old.
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  So I been seven years doing that, like, outside of the last year or so --
L:  Right.  
R:  -- I been only coming maybe one day and certain times when he's not off, I still have to come, too.
L:  Right.  Well, you get your exercise that way, too, with the little ones.
R:  Oh, I sure do.  Well, they're --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- one of them is in school now, but the other little one, he goes at school two days a week.  He's four, but he doesn't go on the days that I'm off.
L:  Oh, that's uh --
R:  And um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  What was I gonna say?  And you know, now that she -- she moved to another, uh, neighborhood.  She lives in Jersey so now they -- this is like a -- if I want to go, like, to the Dollar Store, I want to go to the supermarket, they have like a little area, um, it's like a little mini mall --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- well, I can walk it from here and this is good because it's like an extra three blocks that I could sneak in --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that I didn't have before.
L:  That's right.  That's good.
R:  Yeah.  So do you do much walking around your neighborhood, or do you drive?
L:  Oh, we -- we have to drive.  It's like three and a half miles to the closest store, to even get a loaf of bread, but --
R:  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, you're like in a really deserted area.
L:  It -- well, it -- it's getting more crowded all the time, but I do a lot -- I do gardening and a lot of outside work which --
R:  Oh, well that's very good.
L:  -- at least in the summer, you know --
R:  That is really good.
L:  -- that's good.  In the winter, I should keep -- you know, keep up the exercise, but I sort of take the [LAUGH] time off.  
R:  Right.
L:  Isn't that awful?  [LAUGH].
R:  Right.
L:  But, yeah, we get a lot of uh --
R:  You're home during the day, you don't work?
L:  I'm home, yeah.
R:  Oh.  So you get -- you know, when you're home, you get -- see, I sit, I'm a telephone operator.  That's another thing.
L:  Oh.
R:  Sitting for all day long.
L:  Okay.
R:  I mean, outside of lunch or going to the bathroom or a break, that's another bad thing.  You don't --
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  -- get to exercise much.
L:  I -- yeah.  I used to help a friend out --
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  -- in her business --
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  -- two days a week.
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  Well, whenever she needed me, but it worked out --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the one or two days a week.
R:  Right.
L:  And, boy, that -- I could hardly ever get to sleep those nights because I had not exercised or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- done anything all day except sit --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know?
R:  Right.  Really.
L:  That's not good.  [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  And I would like to incorporate some more exercise into my regime, but it seems like I haven't really been able to do that, but like you said, you know, if you're gardening and all and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you're doing a lot of that, that's great exercise.
L:  Yeah.  That -- that is good exercise.  Just this past year, we got a -- a mower that does the mulching of the grass when you ride over it?
R:  Oh.  Great.
L:  But before that, I was doing all of the raking --
R:  Oh, you were --
L:  -- and stuff and --
R:  -- really getting your -- your --
L:  That's -- that's a lot -- yeah.
R:  -- uh, your --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- amount of exercise.
L:  Right.  Now I watch, uh, my little grandson.  He's --
R:  Oh, do you?
L:  He's gonna turn --
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  -- three on the eighth of June.
R:  Oh, how cute.
L:  So I'm doing a lot of up and down and --
R:  Oh, yeah.  That'll give you a lot --
L:  -- you know, playing with him.  [LAUGH].
R:  -- of exercise, too.
L:  By the time he goes home, I'm winded.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  I'm just like --
L:  But it's fun.
R:  -- not the type to be -- like, if I joined, like, maybe um an exercise class where I saw other people, like really get into it --
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  -- maybe I would be motivated.  I'm just not a type like to stand in front of the TV and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, do all those aerobic exercises.
L:  I know.  I have all the tapes, you know --
R:  Do you?  And you don't --
L:  -- and every once in a while, I put one in, I do half of it and --
R:  Oh, you do it?  Yeah?
L:  -- it's just -- it's just -- motivation is the biggest thing, I think.  
R:  Yeah, that's the thing.  Like, if I had somebody here with me --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I would probably be able to do it.
L:  Right.
R:  It's just that I can't get motivated, but if I decide to retire next year, God willing, ah, they have --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- some classes down at a hospital that's a -- you know, in South Philly that I can --
L:  Oh, good.
R:  -- go to, like, for seniors.
L:  Uh-huh.   Yeah, sure.
R:  And they even have that, uh, aquatic exercise, like indoor pool and all that stuff.
L:  That I would love, yes.
R:  It's not -- like, I mean, I do have some ideas, you know, maybe I will.  I mean, I say a lot of things, but --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] not always get around to doing them.
L:  This -- this is the truth.  [LAUGH].
R:  I know, I know.  But --
L:  Oh, it's too bad.
R:  -- really, I mean, it's so good for your whole cardiovascular system.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
R:  I mean, you really --
L:  There's -- they're uh --
R:  -- really need to uh exercise.
L:  You do.  
R:  Do you have uh -- you have a two storey home where you go up and down the steps all the time?
L:  No, just a one -- just a ranch house.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's what my daughter had.  Now she got a home with, um, you know, two storey, so there's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the steps here so --
L:  That helps.
R:  -- I guess it -- you know, act -- and in my house, I have a lot of steps, so that's one good thing, and then I take the subway every day to work --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and there's about a hundred steps between go -- up and back, you know, going to work --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- um, so I do get a good workout on the subway steps and going -- you know, when I get off there --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- there is a big -- there's about forty eight steps that I have to climb before I get into work.
L:  Oh, that's great.
R:  So that is a good thing, so I'm getting some exercise there, because they say steps are very good.  They help burn a lot of calories.
L:  Wonderful for you, yeah.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Well, I go to the mall and --
R:  Yeah, oh well, that's good.
L:  Not always to buy, I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- mostly -- you know, I just walk around --
R:  You like to look around, yeah.
L:  -- and I'm not doing that speed walking or anything, but I think any kind of walking is better than nothing.  
R:  Oh, anything is wor- you know, I mean, if you can speed walk, it's a little better, but I think any type of walking is really great.
L:  I think so.  Sure.
R:  Yeah.  Do you ever watch these uh, the exercise -- like, um, the people that peddle all the exercise equipment and all their --
L:  Oh, you mean on like the Infomercials?
R:  Yeah?  'Cause there's --
L:  Not a lot.
R:  -- girl there, she has this, um, I don't know, it's like -- it's got -- looks like two huge rubber bands and it's like with attached with a metal and --
L:  Oh, I've seen that.
R:  -- you're supposed to do, like, these breathing exercises.
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  And all --
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  -- these people attest to how great it is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That, you know, it's so you can do it while you're watching TV --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and you're supposed to lose all these inches very quickly --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- and the way that you breathe using them is supposed to help you uh also lose the weight.
L:  Right.
R:  And it's supposed to, you know, tone up your whole -- you know, uh, all your upper arms, your abs and everything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Did you ever see her?  She's a blonde headed girl, long blonde hair?
L:  Probably.  
R:  She's in her fifties.  Like, she looks fabulous.  I can't think of her name.
L:  Yeah, I -- not Denise Sanders?
R:  No, not Denise, no.  Uh --
L:  Or, Austin, is it?  Denise Austin?
R:  Denise Austin, no.  No, it's not --
