R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, this is Shelley, how are you?
R:  Fine.  This is Brittney.
L:  [NOISE] Hi, Brittney. [NOISE] Did you want to start or would you like me to?
R:  Oh, you can, you can go ahead [LAUGH] --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- if you like. [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Um, well, um, I do not exercise as much as I would like to. [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] Um, I'm lazy. [NOISE] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, I do belly dance, [NOISE] um --
R:  Oh, fun. [NOISE] 
L:  -- I used to dance for a living before I met my husband --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- and then that became a no-no.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, not to mention I had a baby after that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and you know, the body --
R:  [NOISE] [MN] 
L:  -- kind of goes to pot. [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] Oh. [LAUGH] 
L:  So, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] I had gained maybe forty pounds --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- since I was [NOISE] oh, twenty three, twenty four years --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- old and I weighed about, mm, [NOISE] hundred and five [NOISE] and I'm five four, so, you know, getting a little bit pudgy around the middle, but [NOISE] [SIGH] I would like to exercise more and if I had a buddy to do it with I probably would.
R:  Right.
L:  Somebody that encouraged me, yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  Okay.  Um, [SIGH] well, [LAUGH] it's just so funny to try to talk on. [SIGH] Um, [SIGH] I do exercise pretty regularly, I just got into jogging --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- at this past, um -- in the past year, I guess --
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  -- [SIGH] and I was never very athletic, horrible at sports, afraid of the ball, I --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- I like dancing, [SIGH], and I like, um, individual, like power walking and things but I [SIGH] have never been much into teams or sports --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- but, [SIGH] um, I started jogging, mm --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- this -- this past year, about a sum- last summer I think --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] and, um, [COUGH] I improved and found that I could go f- further and further and that was really exciting for me, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and [SIGH] --
L:  Do you jog by yourself, or do you have a -- somebody that you jog with, or ?
R:  I go alone a lot [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, and I started out running mostly on the treadmill, [SIGH] but now I'm getting to where I go outside which is easier to find a friend to go with but [SIGH] sometimes it's hard to find someone who's around my level because [SIGH] I'm so scared to go with someone who's a better runner than me [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um -- so it's kind of intimidating if I know someone else is in great, great shape, I don't want to go --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- with them [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but, um, [SIGH] no, I do go --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- to the gym, um, when I can, which isn't that often, [SIGH] but I do enjoy going to the gym and doing weights and everything, but I don't do much of that.  Um, I do a lot of, like, ab workouts and pushups --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and things in my house, but I don't really go to a gym regularly. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, [SIGH] do you [MN] read any of the fitness magazines ever?  Do you ever [MN] buy those --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the shape or fitness or anything --
L:  Yes, I do, a-
R:  -- where they have the plans in there? [SIGH] 
L:  Yes, and -- and they're encouraging for about a day or two and --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I even cut out pictures and go, "I'm going to look like that --"
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  "-- again" [SIGH] and, um, [MN] yeah, I've even do the --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- Atkins.  I do -- well, I don't really --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- do Atkins, I guess, because [SIGH] I just try to watch my carbs and keep them a little bit lower.  I have a thyroid disease so [SIGH] --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- it -- you know, it -- [SIGH] it, um, has a lot to do with your metabolism [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and things, so my metabolism is a little more sluggish and stuff than --
R:  Right.
L:  -- somebody that doesn't have a thyroid problem. [SIGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Do you, um, change your diet around that?  Or [MN] do you need to with --
L:  Um, they -- they s- they say that the -- the Atkins type of a diet and h- more protein and less carbs, [SIGH] um, really helps with that.
R:  [SIGH] Right.
L:  Um --
R:  And I hear that's good for anyone --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- though, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as long as it's not too extreme --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- on the Atkins where you don't get enough carbs, but [SIGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I mean, I hear that that's a good way to drop --
L:  Right.
R:  -- pounds for anyone. [SIGH] 
L:  yeah, [SIGH] and, well, see, I h- I love Pepsi. [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, really?
L:  I am a Pepsiholic --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and, um, I have [MN] a Pepsi every day --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and I have migraine headaches if I don't have one.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And I would love to go jogging, [SIGH] but, um, I'm about five five, a hundred and forty to a hundred and forty five pounds.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I wear a size five pants [SIGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and the rest is in my chest. [SIGH] 
R:  Oh.
L:  [SIGH] [MN] 
R:  [SIGH] Well, [MN] at least it's not all in your butt. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Well, you know, I just, you know -- I think when I'm jogging, you know, and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- s- or I'm out there, I'm [SIGH] holding my breath or [SIGH] I'm thinking, [MN] "God, somebody's going to be thinking, 'Gosh, she's going to get a black eye'" --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- type of a thing. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, oh, gosh.  Have you ever --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- try -- have you ever considered going to see --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- a trainer or go -- uh, like, [MN] becoming a member at a gym where you could do more than just jog, you could do other machines and classes?
L:  [SIGH] Oh, yeah, I do -- I have a friend that works at, uh, curves for women --
R:  Oh, yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  -- and I so I go [MN] down there every once in a while, you know, and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I just hang out with her and go around a couple of times, but --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] yeah, I do that a little bit, it's just not consistent.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  Yeah, [SIGH] I don't -- I don't look fat by no means --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- just a little pudgier --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- in the ab section than I would like to be.
R:  Right, [SIGH] I --
L:  So [SIGH] --
R:  -- feel the same way as you do.  I just don't have the top heavy part. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] [SIGH] And you know what?  When I was younger and dancing, I loved my breasts [NOISE] you know, I liked the idea of being full figured and everything but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- after you have a baby and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, things are -- y- you gain a little weight [NOISE] and it seems that that's where I've gained all of my weight [NOISE] --
R:  [SIGH] Was, uh --
L:  -- [SIGH] that --
R:  -- belly dancing a good form of exercise, though?
L:  Oh, yes, it is.  It's a great form a- and I love to dance so [SIGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and everything, so it's great exercise. [NOISE] [SIGH] Um --
R:  do you still do any dancing at all?
L:  [SIGH] I don't perform. [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] Right, but I d- I mean, do you go dancing or do you --
L:  Oh, no, my husband --
R:  -- teach, maybe, or ?
L:  -- no, my husband enjoys staying on the computer and so, you know, my -- my lifestyle has changed.
R:  Right.
L:  So --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and I think that's a big thing when you get married --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- and have children, the lifestyle changes and it's hard, you know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] our metabolisms --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- slow down and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and everything and then --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, that happens, I mean --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it's different for everyone, I guess --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when your metabolism slows down, but it -- it'll happen to everyone. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] Are you married, or ?
R:  I'm not. [SIGH] Um, I'm actually [MN] twenty, in college.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, oh, okay.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Well, I'm thirty four.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, yeah, [SIGH] um, my metabolism is j- I'm just really --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- kind of noticing it and -- and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- stuff, so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, [SIGH] [NOISE] it'll -- like I said, by no means am I really fat or everything, I'm just, um, [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] heavier than I would like to be I guess, you know, it -- [SIGH] when -- when, you know, you weigh a hundred and five pounds and then you're trying to [NOISE] put on your size three pants again and you're like, "Ah, I want to be back there".
R:  [SIGH] But if you only --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- moved up to a size five, that's not too bad.
L:  Yeah, that's not too bad.  It seems --
R:  No.
L:  -- like I said, it's all in my breasts that I --
R:  Right. [SIGH] --
L:  yeah, uh, well, I -- it's distributed amongst my breasts and my back.  I gained weight on my back.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, that does --
L:  So --
R:  -- happen.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know what you mean by that, that does happen, yes. [LAUGH] [SIGH] 
L:  So, anyway, [NOISE] it seems
R:  Have you tried something like power walking?  That's fun.
L:  [SIGH] No, I have never tried that.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  T- tell me about it.
R:  Um, well, I tried that before I started [MN] going jogging [SIGH] because I just couldn't even [MN] catch my breath when I went jogging, I was horrible at it --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- but, [SIGH] um, I started out power walking [SIGH] with friends and, uh, you know, there was three or four of us would go together, [SIGH] which made it really fun, 'cause then you're trying to keep up with each other and when --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- one person speeds up you're all kinda speeding up together, and it's funny, you just don't talk.  And, um, [LIPSMACK] we would go for about an hour, [SIGH] um, when we would [MN] take off from --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- my dorm.  This is when I was freshman --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] and we would, um, [LIPSMACK] go for about an hour, just all around campus where there's hills in some places [SIGH] and it was fun because [SIGH] I wouldn't be too out off breath but the -- my legs would be killing me, they would be so sore --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] and I really started telling -- being able to tell the difference, and I built that up to where [SIGH] after a few months of going power walking a lot, I was able to start jogging and it was easier for me.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] And so I built on that.
L:  Now, what exactly is power walking?  Do you put, like, [NOISE] those weights around your --
R:  [SIGH] No, uh --
L:  -- flanks, or ?
R:  -- we didn't, we just walked, but [MN] quickly, very -- a fast pace and keep your arms at your sides --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and your elbows bent and we just --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- d- went quick.
L:  Do you swing your elbows more, or ?
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  Do you -- you swing your arms more?
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah, that would be --
R:  And you just try to walk --
L:  -- really good for me.
R:  -- I mean, as fast as you can, I guess, but keep a pace with it [SIGH] and you can do -- it's kind of like jogging because you can still speed it up or slow it down, you can still --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- do [SIGH] intervals with it and [SIGH] it's also good, um, on a treadmill if you were to try it [SIGH] just walk and you can go longer than you can running --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [SIGH] and apparently, from things I've read, you burn the same amount of calories, um, [SIGH] out mile per mile --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- hour per hour, [MN] um, [MN] jogging --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and power walking, like, probably because you can just keep it up longer and keep your heart rate steady [SIGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- longer, but, um, [SIGH] I --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- definitely notice the difference when I [LIPSMACK] tried power walking.  And it's fun 'cause you g- it's easier to go in a group. [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And -- [SIGH] or on a treadmill, just change the, um, incline [SIGH] and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it'll be more of a workout if you -- on a hill and then take it back down to flat level, [SIGH] but it's fun. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, [SIGH] my sister, um, had been [NOISE] almost two hundred pounds and she's about five six. [NOISE] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Four kids --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um, [NOISE] you know, when her marriage she didn't -- she just got out of a marriage, a bad marriage --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- so, [SIGH] um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- she started --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- going walking and she is down to a size three now.
R:  Oh, good.
L:  And half and hour --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- walks every day --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- for about, oh, I don't know, five or six months.
R:  And that makes such a difference to you 'cause it -- I think anything that you do, even if, you know, it sounds like it's easy, it's just walking, but [SIGH] anything that you're upping your, um, energy level and that you're --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- upping your heart rate every day, [SIGH] I -- anything like that's going to help you out.
L:  Right, right. [SIGH] I think the hard part for me --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- is the consistency.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  Or making a commitment to doing it.  That's why I said, you know, if I had a buddy [SIGH] or something like that it'd be easier for me because I [MN] -- you know, I wouldn't break a date with them, but I'd break a date with myself.
R:  [NOISE] Right. [NOISE] It's [NOISE] --
