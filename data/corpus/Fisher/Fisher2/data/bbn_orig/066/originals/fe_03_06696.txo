R:  Hi, I'm Tonya.
L:  Hi, I'm Naomi.
R:  Hi.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm from --
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  -- New York. [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm in Texas. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, wow. [LAUGH] 
L:  Cool. [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, fitness.  I work out, um, six days a week usually, I try. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] That's good.  It's hard to get in that habit. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  [LAUGH] I try, but I -- I don't usually make it. [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh, yeah, that -- I was like that and then I -- once I get into a regimen, I'm really good and then I'll -- I'll stop and then I'll lose it and then I won't go back for a while and then I'll start again. [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  It's like flexing[?]. 
L:  Yeah.  That's -- that's how I get.  I was going to the gym for a while and then I just -- it got so busy, I think that's part of it, I just got so busy and then now I don't go at all, but I'll go on walks with my husband or go bike riding --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or maybe rollerblading, so ...
R:  Well, that's still a lot of exercise also. 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  I would like to do that more, like, get outside in the summertime, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with the biking and exercising, you know, but it -- for me just the easiest thing is to go to the gym and work out for two hours, come home and that's it. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just -- it's easier -- it's easier that way.  I get more discipline I think at the gym than I would if I was just --
L:  [MN] Yeah.  That's true too.
R:  -- doing it --
L:  Do --
R:  -- myself.
L:  Do you work with a personal trainer?
R:  No, no, I'm -- well, actually one of my best friends is a personal trainer, so --
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  -- I usually work out with her. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I have the best of both worlds there. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't have to pay for it. 
L:  Oh, that's nice. 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Ho- -- oh, they're expensive. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, she charges, I think, ninety five dollars an hour.
L:  Ooh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ouch. 
R:  So, and --
L:  When we joined, um, our gym, we got a free session with a personal trainer, and he was really good and we wanted to continue but, like, ow --
R:  Yeah, they're --
L:  -- that much? [LAUGH] 
R:  And it's -- and you -- you know, like, one or two sessions doesn't really seem to work with them, you need to have, like, a --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- couple, so you can actually --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know, see what you have to do and stuff, and --
L:  Yeah, and get used to the routines. 
R:  Yeah, and that's, you know, a lot of people get bored with the same routine over and over --
L:  Right.
R:  -- again.  So at least when I work out with her, it's just, like, okay, she'll be like, "Okay, we'll do this one day and we'll do that one day, we'll take a class the next day and --"
L:  That's cool.
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  That's a good friend. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Well, she has to do it anyway, so she's like, "Might as well just do it with me". [LAUGH] I'm like, "Okay". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't have to pay for your services.  I'll do it. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, yeah, but --
L:  But that's good.
R:  -- in the summertime, I'd like to get out and go rollerblading, it's just for me, you know, by the time I get home from work and stuff, it's so dark out, I don't wanna go roller blading.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  It's just easier to go to the gym and stuff, so ...
L:  Yeah, and it's -- it's by yourself too.  It's safer that way.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  You know, and I don't like working out by myself.  Usually I like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- having somebody there to talk to and stuff. 
L:  A motivator.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, I mean, I do a lot of classes and stuff, which I don't mind doing those by myself 'cause somebody else just usually gets in the way --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- but when you're walking on a treadmill for an hour, you know, you want somebody to talk to. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah --
R:  But it --
L:  -- that's true. 
R:  -- just listening to your headphones, but at least you have your husband to go out walking and stuff with you, that's nice.
L:  Yeah.  It's cool.
R:  Gives you guys some time together and all that, which is nice. 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  So ...
L:  We review our day, gives us time to do that at least. [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, that's good. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's good.
L:  Otherwise we're sitting home in front of the T.V. or, you know, each working on bills or doing something where we're not -- can't exactly communicate. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I hear that one. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Are you married?
R:  No, no --
L:  No?
R:  -- no.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  No. [LAUGH] I just have a live in and that's enough. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  That's enough. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  He's at the gym actually right now. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, we go at separate times.
L:  We got a good topic, didn't we? [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes, I know, I like this topic.  I had --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- sports last time, and I was like, "I know nothing about sports".  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.  Yeah, I think I skipped that one.  I'm like, "No, thanks". [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, that was, like, one of my first ones, I was like, "Okay, um, let's see, what can I talk to you about?  The yankees, that's all I know". [LAUGH] But ...
L:  [LAUGH] That's the time when you hope for another person who likes to talk a lot. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  And, thank God, this guy did.  He was like, chat, chat.  And it was like, "Okay, this works". [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  This works a lot.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, no, the fitness I'm like, "Oh, okay, I can do this one.  I know that".  And I just got back from the gym about an hour ago, so ... [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  It works out.  So ...
L:  That's cool.
R:  Yeah.  How's -- how's Texas over with the -- Texas is very, um -- isn't it -- like, it's kind of like California, with the fitness and everybody's in shape and all that?
L:  Mm, I -- not that -- I mean, a lot --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of people do go to the gym, but I don't know that we're, you know, one of the top fitness --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- places or anything. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  In fact --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I -- I was reading in the Self magazine, they had an article about all of this healthier states and the, you know, the most dangerous states, and they had this survey thing and they were -- I think Dallas did not rate very well on the healthiest.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  But I -- I don't know.  That would be interesting. 
R:  You would think, you know, people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, like the women in Texas, you see them always on --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- [LAUGH] [NOISE] the perfect little cheer leaders.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  I guess that's only, you know, a select few.
L:  And the cow girls and the tight jeans.
R:  Yeah, exactly. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Just the select few.  'Cause New Yorkers are definitely not in any kind of category.  We're probably one of the --
L:  No?
R:  -- most overweight --
L:  Really?
R:  -- if anything. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, everybody's -- but in the summertime everybody gets so health conscious and, you know, always wants to get into shape --
L:  Oh, yeah. 
R:  -- like, "No, you need to do that year round".
L:  Yeah. 
R:  That's, like -- that's the hardest thing, I think, though.
L:  Yes.
R:  Like, doing it year round.
L:  Very hard. 
R:  [NOISE] 'Cause who wants to go out in the middle of a snow storm?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And we've had a few of those. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] We've been having some bad hail storms recently.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, ah, it's a little different than snow, but ... [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, but --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- but still just as dangerous, if not more dangerous. [NOISE]
L:  Right.
R:  You know. 
L:  Right.
R:  Now we're just freezing our tushies off 'cause it's so damn cold --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and it's almost June. [LAUGH] 
L:  It's still really cold?
R:  Oh, it -- today -- well, today was -- today wasn't too bad.  Today was about sixty five.  Yesterday was, um, hit the -- about the thirties. 
L:  Ooh.
R:  We've been having --
L:  Ooh, see, I couldn't stand that. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's -- it's horrible.  We've been having some really bad weather and it's just been -- it hasn't stopped raining for a week. 
L:  Oh.
R:  And we're like, "Okay, we want warm weather and no rain". [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  But it doesn't seem like it's going to s- -- they say it's gonna rain till Friday and still be chilly. 
L:  Mm.
R:  Oh, and I'm like, "I'm not looking".  I'm like, "Okay, Arizona's looking better and better every day". [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Are you going to Arizona?
R:  No, I wanna --
L:  No, you just --
R:  -- move there.  My, ah, my boyfriend's trying to convince me to move there and I'm --
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  -- like, "Ah, I don't know, I don't know".  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I like -- I'm too much of a New Yorker. 
L:  That's a big change.
R:  Yeah.  I think that the whole wildlife, like the snakes and all that, scare [LAUGH] me.
L:  Ew, yuck. 
R:  I don't want something crawling through my toilet bowl, or [LAUGH] you know. 
L:  Ew. 
R:  Like the scorpions. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So ...  But, yeah, I have a -- I have -- he has family out there so that's why he wants to go, and I'm like, "Oh, okay, we'll see, bye bye". [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- yeah, at least we'd be in shape there, because then you're in a bikini all the time.
L:  Yeah, probably. [LAUGH] 
R:  You know.  So that the whole weather factor thing too.  They -- I was watching it on -- watching the news the other day saying, "When you go swimsuit shopping, make sure you apply self tanner and --"
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  "-- and shave and so you can --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, even if it's dreary out, you can make yourself, you know, feel like you're in spring and stuff".  And I'm like [inaudible] --"
L:  Get the whole effect. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, get the whole total effect.  I'm like, "Oh, okay". [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Think I'm going to have to go fake tanning, 'cause w- we're never going to have a summer here. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's so cold.
L:  Are you -- did you grow up there?  You from New York?
R:  Yes, I'm -- I'm born and bred.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  So that's a big change thinking about moving out to Arizona.
R:  Yeah, I -- I mean, I've visited -- I've visited a lot out there in Sedona -- his family's from Sedona -- and it's beautiful --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I really do enjoy it there, but I don't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  New York is just New York, you know.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Are you born in Texas?
L:  I was born in Illinois, but I grew up in Texas.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I wasn't in Illinois for very long, so ... I feel like I'm a Texan. [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And what part of Te- -- you from Dallas?
L:  Yeah, actually.  Just, um -- well, I work in Dallas, but I live about thirty -- thirty minutes north.
R:  Oh, that's -- so Dallas is a nice big city?
L:  Oh, yeah. 
R:  It's not like --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- it's not like, you know, you're in one of those little --
L:  [LAUGH] No.
R:  -- village kind of places? 
L:  No, not at all.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I don't think I could de- -- like, when you hear all those people, like, where they l- -- tornados and all this and I'm like, "W- why don't they just move?" [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  "Move off the farm". [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  "Go in to a city". 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I guess, you know, when --
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  -- you're used to that. 
L:  Yeah, but I mean, tornados still hit the cities, like Fort Worth a couple of years ago really bad, and --
R:  Ah, yeah. 
L:  -- they don't avoid it.  But [MN] --
R:  Yeah, they have -- we had a tornado I think a couple of years ago, just like a freak thing in New York.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah. 
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  Don't hear about that very often.
R:  No.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] Not at all.  I'm, like, [NOISE] you know, bad enough we even get hurricanes --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know.  We get --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- those every once in a blue moon. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  But, um, no, we just get lots of rain and lots and lots of snow.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, I couldn't deal with that. 
R:  Yeah, just, yeah, the winters are pretty --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's either really, really cold with no snow, or it's just extremely cold with a lot of snow.  This year we got, I think, one -- in one shot within two days we got, um, I think it was, like, six feet of snow. 
L:  Oh, sheesh.  Man -- oh -- oh -- oh. 
R:  Yeah, you couldn't see anything. 
L:  [MN]
R:  I was like, "Oh, good, I don't have to go to work". [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm like, "Yeah". [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [inaudible] That was the only -- the only good part about it. [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, we got, um, snow I think once -- well, per- -- maybe a couple times, but once and, you know, it iced over.  We didn't go to work, it was a huge issue, and -- but [LAUGH] you all get six, that's hilarious.
R:  It -- that's funny, you guys just, like, shut down.
L:  I know, we do.
R:  I mean, we shut down with that much snow, but ... [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Where, you know, people are still out there, you know, the kids are all out running around --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and stuff. [LAUGH] It's, like, you guys just shut down everything, doesn't --
L:  We don't have a clue --
R:  -- what to do.
L:  -- what to do. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  No snow blowers, no none of that.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
