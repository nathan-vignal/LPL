L:  [NOISE] 
R:  H-
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  [SIGH] Hi. [SIGH] [MN] 
L:  This is Loretta from Wisconsin.
R:  [SIGH] Hi, [NOISE] this is Evelyn from Minnesota.
L:  Hi, Evelyn. [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] You're --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- pretty close, actually.
L:  Yes, yes. 
R:  Where in Minnesota -- uh, where --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- in Wisconsin?
L:  [SIGH] [NOISE] Actually in the south western corner. [SIGH] We're, like [NOISE] --
R:  [SIGH] Well, we're, um, in Minneapolis.
L:  Okay, okay. [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I have some cousins, uh, who live there.
R:  Oh, okay. [SIGH] 
L:  But not that I have -- I've been there recently.  It's been many, many, many years.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, but -- [SIGH] so, the topic for today is health and fitness and do we exercise regularly.
R:  Correct.
L:  And if so, how, and if not --
R:  And if not [SIGH] --
L:  -- what do we want to do, right?
R:  Or if we want to.
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH] Well, w-
L:  If we want to [LAUGH] -- I mean --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- if we want to at all.  Hm, no. [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN] [LAUGH] Well, do I want to?  Um --
L:  You [SIGH] --
R:  -- [MN] no, I'm lazy.
L:  -- versus -- right, right.
R:  [SIGH] Um, I just --
L:  Me too.
R:  [MN] do I need to?  Yes, um, I just had my second and last child three months --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ago.
L:  Okay, and congratulations.
R:  [SIGH] Thank you.  And I am [SIGH] in my mid to late thirties now, [SIGH] so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I need to --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] -- well, I've lost the weight from my fi- from my second child --
L:  [NOISE] Okay.
R:  -- that I gained, but I haven't --
L:  That's good.
R:  -- lost in -- I didn't lose eight pounds from the first child.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay.  And how old is the first child now?
R:  She's three and a half.
L:  [NOISE] Okay.
R:  [SIGH] So, that's what I'm working on now. [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay. [NOISE] [SIGH] 
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  Now, may I ask, and this may be per- too personal, are you breastfeeding?
R:  Uh, no --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- not any more.
L:  Okay. [NOISE] 
R:  And I had a --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- production problem so --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- um, I couldn't --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- actually.
L:  Okay, all right.
R:  [SIGH] So, but [SIGH] that, um -- [MN] I couldn't, um, as well, with my first child.  I have, um, a growth on my pituitary gland that causes --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- interruption of my production --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- but, um, [SIGH] we tried, but, um, that didn't help so that --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] that part about losing the extra --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- weight type thing --
L:  Right.
R:  -- didn't [MN] -- that didn't --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- go for me. [SIGH] 
L:  Okay. [NOISE] 
R:  I guess the -- the one --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- exercise that I do the most now is run after --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- my three year old.
L:  Uh-huh. [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] A- [LAUGH] that's --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- my biggest one, [SIGH] and the second one would -- would be walking, that's --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the only thing that I do --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- regularly.
L:  So do you actually have a chance [NOISE] to walk regularly? [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] Well, I've -- [MN] I'm almost on a once a weeker at least with one --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- person, if my husband can get --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- home in time from work. [SIGH] So --
L:  [LIPSMACK] and then you take the kids with you?
R:  No, um --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I leave them home with -- with my husband.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, oh, I see.  Okay, okay.
R:  [SIGH] If he's home I can --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- regu- I can regulate my exercise a lot better.
L:  Right, right. [SIGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Otherwise I don't do a very good job at it.  How about you?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. [SIGH] Well, I have a six and a half year old, a three and a half year old, and just two [NOISE] two year, uh, twins.
R:  Oh, my --
L:  They just turned two. [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, my god. [SIGH] 
L:  So --
R:  So, four of 'em.
L:  [SIGH] So, you just --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you just had your twins?
L:  [MN] Well, they're two years old.
R:  Okay.
L:  My youngest are --are two year old twins, yeah, they --
R:  Oh, my.
L:  -- just turned two.  Yeah.
R:  Okay, so you have a full house.
L:  I have a full house.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, my six and a half year old, he's in school during the day, which of course ends this Friday, [SIGH] so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- he'll be home for the summer. [NOISE] [SIGH] So, I have my three and a half year old and then the twins, and the twins keep me very busy. [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] 
R:  Yes, I bet.
L:  They are -- they -- I -- I just tell everybody they tag team me --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- you know, one will start with something and I go after that one and then the other one goes off and finds something [NOISE] so by the --
R:  Right.
L:  -- time I'm done, [SIGH] [NOISE] you know, straightening [NOISE] out the first one I got to turn round and go see what the other one's into. [NOISE] 
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH] And -- and that's pretty much [NOISE] what it is all day. [SIGH] 
R:  I bet.
L:  Um, [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] when I had my first, I didn't lose the weight either, after him [SIGH] --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and then I had my second, my daughter [SIGH] and I lost -- I f- was finally getting to the point where I was starting to lose weight --
R:  Right.
L:  -- when she was eighteen months and I got pregnant with the twins.
R:  Oh, I bet. [LAUGH] Oh.
L:  So, then, you know, it's like, "Okay, well, so much for that".
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So then I had the twins, but with the twins I did -- I was able to breast feed [NOISE] for the longest, and I went until they were [NOISE] twenty two months.
R:  Okay.
L:  Which I so did not plan on doing, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it just turned out that way. [SIGH] So that was, like, my biggest and easiest weight loss program ever.
R:  [SIGH] You see, I've heard that over and over and over again.
L:  Yeah, I mean, and it -- you know, and if you double it I f- I guess --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, if you have twins, [NOISE] you know, it just --
R:  That's probably twice as easy.
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH] So, I --
L:  So, now that I --
R:  So, that was your weight -- workout program. [LAUGH] 
L:  Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, now that I've [NOISE] stopped, since they just turned, you know, twenty four months, or two years, now it's maintaining that, [SIGH] so --
R:  And are you --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- are you working at it?
L:  [SIGH] I'm not really working at it.  You know, now that it has gotten nice [NOISE] up in this area of the country --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [SIGH] I want to start walking, but [NOISE] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's kind of the same situation as you, is being able to have somebody to watch the kids, [SIGH] because, you know, if you go walking with kids and they're walking or [SIGH] even if you're pushing a stroller or pulling a wagon --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [SIGH] you're not really doing a good walk.
R:  I could do it with -- with the infant --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- w- without a problem but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- three and a half year old --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you have one of those, [SIGH] you know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- a walk --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- means, you know, lets; stop and look at the ants and pick --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- a worm and [SIGH] you know --
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
R:  -- what's this leaf and let's chalk on --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the ground here and [SIGH] --
L:  It -- well, it --
R:  -- oh, let's go say --
L:  -- takes you --
R:  -- hello to -- right.
L:  [NOISE] it takes you, you know, forty five minutes just to get around one block, you know. [LAUGH] 
R:  Seriously.
L:  I know.
R:  Literally.
L:  [SIGH] So, I really want to and I've just been thinking, "Gosh, how am I going to do this?"  Because I see people walking in the evenings here and I do see people walking in the morning [SIGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but in the morning, it's of course, you know, like, seven o'clock and my husband's already left for work --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- 'cause he leaves for work anywhere [NOISE] between [SIGH] five thirty and six fifteen at -- at the absolute latest.
R:  [MN] Does he get home at a decent time?
L:  Well, like, right now, he just walked in [NOISE] --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- [SIGH] so, I could, but then it's kinda, like, it's dinner time, it's, you know --
R:  And then it's bath time and then it's --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- bedtime.
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH] And you could --
L:  So --
R:  -- give up that routine once, maybe twice a week but that's at the most.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Right, the same here.
L:  So, I've kind of been thinking -- this is as far as I got -- is thinking, "If I wake up just, like, at, [LIPSMACK] oh, like, five o'clock [LAUGH] in the morning [SIGH] and throw on sweats, I could do a f- good quick walk.  It'd be, you know, crisp and cool and [SIGH] --"
R:  Can you do that --
L:  "-- I could come in and --"
R:  -- though?  I'm -- I just can't seem to get that kind of --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- energy up.
L:  Ha, that's the thing, that's why I've only been thinking [LAUGH] about it.
R:  'Cause, um, I don't know if this too personal, but may I ask how old you are?
L:  [SIGH] I just turned forty.
R:  Okay, and I'm thirty six.
L:  Okay.
R:  [SIGH] Now, don't you --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- think it's a lot harder for us to want to get up at five o'clock in the morning [SIGH] when you went to bed [SIGH] at -- you know --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- you know [SIGH] --
L:  You just went to bed.
R:  -- granted my three and a half year old I can sometimes get down as early as eight or eight thirty --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and that's beautiful, but she doesn't --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- nap during the day. [SIGH] So, [LAUGH] that's a hard day.
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH] Bu, um, if I can get her down that early then I can maybe do something, but it's --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it's too late to go walking --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- at eight thirty, nine o'clock --
L:  Right, right. [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] and it's too late to go to the gym.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you wind up, you know, doing some housework, getting some laundry done [SIGH] and watching some TV and then it's time for bed.
L:  Right, right. [NOISE] [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  And, see, that's just it, whenever I'm doing, like, just the chores around the house --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, I try to think, "Okay, I'm exercising".  And, like, uh, one time I saw this thing on TV one -- one of those home and garden shows --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [SIGH] where there w- the lady was out raking and she was all, [SIGH] "Now, you know, when you rake the yard after you've mowed it, don't just rake it but really, you know, lunge and rake" [SIGH] and so the other day, I was doing that and I thought --
R:  A lunge and rake. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right, and I just thought --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the neighbors must jus think I'm an idiot because [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] I do --
L:  -- I'm lunging and raking --
R:  I know.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Probably, yeah, yeah, yeah. [SIGH] I keep --
L:  [SIGH] But --
R:  -- thinking that I -- that's the kind --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- of stuff I would have to pick up doing too, because I have d- no idea how I'm going to do this --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I don't want to be fifty and [SIGH] not be able to keep up with my, you know, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- teenage kids at that point. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right, right, and, you know -- and then [MN] and you know, having them at this age [NOISE] [SIGH] don't you sometimes wonder, like, "What was I thinking?"
R:  [SIGH] I know, I know, and [MN] we --
L:  But -- 
R:  -- would have physically had it so much easier if we did it --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- ten years earlier, [SIGH] but --
L:  Physically, right.
R:  -- [MN] physically, but mentally I know that I'm --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- twenty thousand times better.  I can stay home with them as well.
L:  Right, see --
R:  Which I couldn't have done ten years earlier.
L:  Right, and see, that's what I think, you know, [MN] it -- no way -- there is no way possible I was emotionally ready, you know, at twenty [SIGH] --
R:  No.
L:  -- to have kids, you know.
R:  No.
L:  It taught me in my twenties, no way.
R:  Now, I did get married, though, at --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- twenty two [SIGH] --
L:  Same here.
R:  -- and -- and I didn't have my first until I was thirty two. 
L:  [NOISE] See, I had mine at --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- thir- --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- thir- I think thirty two --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- thirty two or thirty three.
R:  Yeah, so we're in the very same boat here.
L:  Right, right.
R:  So [SIGH] --
L:  Because I remember thinking [SIGH] at [NOISE] thir- I think it [NOISE] was at age thirty five, and I don't know if it's the same, you know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- in Wisconsin but, like [NOISE] in California --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- which is where I had all of my children --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] um, at thirty five they -- they --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- give you [NOISE] the amniocentesis test, like, it's highly --
R:  [SIGH] Right.
L:  -- recommended.
R:  I had a choice.  Um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they're giving you the choice now up to forty.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [SIGH] You don't necessarily need to have one.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, it's -- it's getting a little better about that.
L:  Right. [SIGH] So, I just remembered thinking, "Oh, my gosh, I got to slip this child in under the gun here because I don't really want to sit there [NOISE] and look at this big giant needle going into my stomach". [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, I can understand [LAUGH] that. [LAUGH] 
L:  There's [LAUGH] -- oh -- [LAUGH] [SIGH] so, you know, and that show it was with my son [NOISE] and my daughter, and then of course with the twins I did have a [NOISE] choice and [SIGH] I had the same doctor and she was really wonderful [NOISE] she was like, "Well, either way you're going to keep the baby, right?"  And I said, "Yeah".  She says, "So then you don't have to have to have it [NOISE] if you don't want to".  And I said, "That's fine" [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I didn't, you know, and they turned out [NOISE] perfectly normal, fine, healthy babies, so [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] -- 
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- but, yeah, as far as the e-
