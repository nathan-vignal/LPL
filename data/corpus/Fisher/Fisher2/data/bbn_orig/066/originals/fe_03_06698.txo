L:  Hello.
R:  [SIGH] Hello.  M- my --
L:  Hi.
R:  M- m-
L:  [SIGH] This is Kathy from Cleveland.
R:  Kathy from Cleveland? [SIGH] This --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is Lucy from Florida. [SIGH] 
L:  Oh, what -- what type of -- what part of Florida?
R:  [SIGH] Panama City.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, northern part --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- huh?
R:  Yeah. [SIGH] Listen I --
L:  So --
R:  -- didn't understand what she said the topic was.  Did you catch it?
L:  Um, health and fitness, exercising, do we exercise regularly. [SIGH] 
R:  Oh.
L:  I- if so, what do we do.  If we don't --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- like, what -- what could we do to start or whatever, so ...
R:  Okay.
L:  [SIGH] So, you have the perfect weather down there [LIPSMACK] for exercising, right?
R:  Yes, I walk mainly, walking and gardening are my two main exercises --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [SIGH] and I can do both of those just about year round down here.
L:  Right, you're lucky. [SIGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  In Cleveland we're limited. [SIGH] Um, [SIGH] uh, my husband and I were walking in the metro parks but then, um, [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] once winter came we sort of stopped and we haven't, um, got back into it it's been so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- cold and rainy and that. [SIGH] My husband does the gardening, so [SIGH] I go up and down the steps with the wash. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  And, 'cause --
R:  Well, I love gardening, so I spend -- that's a lot of my -- biggest part of my exercise comes from that [SIGH] and then I go up and down the steps too, that's another thing, I -- we have a two storey house --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and I do get plenty of exercise going up and down steps.
L:  Mhm. [SIGH] 
R:  [MN] 
L:  Um, do you walk outside, or do you ?
R:  Outside, uh --
L:  Mhm. [SIGH] 
R:  -- we -- sometimes I walk along the beach [SIGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and other times I have a -- a next door neighbor that's had a stroke --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and she walks with a walker --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] so me and her, uh, we take a walk around the block with our dogs --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just about every night.
L:  Mhm. [SIGH] Oh, we don't have a dog, so I, um, [SIGH] can't use that [SIGH] for an --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- excuse but I -- [SIGH] I try to [NOISE] do some of the errands in the neighborhood by walking --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if, um, I figure I won't have too many --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- groceries or anything that I have to carry. [SIGH] But, um --
R:  Have you --
L:  -- [COUGH] it --
R:  [SIGH] I've tried, you know, doing the stationary bicycle and I've also tried on the, uh, treadmill.
L:  Mhm.
R:  My husband had a heart check several years ago and we got a treadmill afterwards when he was recuperating, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, um, those kind of things are just so boring to me.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I just don't -- I just can't get much, uh -- even when I had television on while I was doing it, it still didn't really help.
L:  Uh, well, uh, uh, for me, up here in Cleveland it was, um, a little bit -- would be better for me, [LIPSMACK] um --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- we do have one but [SIGH] for sole reason it stopped working so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't know if it can be repaired or worth being repaired or whatever but [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] I didn't mind that.  Um, I would read, so I didn't, you know, go for speed or anything, I just --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- went for the walking [LIPSMACK] and, um, I could read, um, a book and that.  But, um, [LIPSMACK] um, we don't have the stationary bike.  My daughter had a stationary bike before she moved out -- uh, got married out, [SIGH] and, um, [SIGH] it was too hard on the butt. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  Well, they have senior classes here at the junior college, uh --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- for six weeks over spring and fall --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I took yoga classes at one of them --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, uh, tai chi at the other one.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, uh, once again, I'm just not too, uh, [SIGH] [MN] -- can't get into too regimented exercise, like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, I just --
L:  You're more the free spirit --
R:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH] I guess --
L:  -- ra- [LAUGH] 
R:  -- so. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [LAUGH] rather do it at your own pace --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- at your own [SIGH] -- own -- own time and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- everything. [LIPSMACK] But, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, we [SIGH] -- we like to go to the [SIGH] -- the parks and, um, [MN] they have the paved --
R:  Oh, the parks --
L:  --paths.
R:  -- are a nice place to go to.
L:  Yeah, they have the paved path and [SIGH] they have the mile marker so we knew how far we were walking and that, and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it was nice, [LIPSMACK] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- but then [SIGH] we just can't seem to shake the [SIGH] -- the bad weather and so --
R:  You all really had a cold winter, didn't you?
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] and it -- [SIGH] it's not getting any better and, um, [MN] even to the weekend they're saying it's not going to be that great a weather.
R:  Do you ever try -- try mall walking? [NOISE] 
L:  Um, [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] we have a mall close to us, but it's sort of closed down, so we haven't --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- been there [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- couple of times we did go to, um, [LIPSMACK] a mall that was a little farther away, but --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- some of those people are so [SIGH] serious about it, you have to stay out of their way, they'll run you over. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, yeah, no, uh, um, we're a little more --
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- laid back than that.
L:  Mhm.  But, um, you know, I don't want to try to set any records or anything, I just want to --
R:  [MN] Oh, you have a super Wal-Mart?
L:  Um, no, no.
R:  Oh, okay, we do.
L:  [MN] 
R:  [SIGH] Those stores are huge, that's another way that if it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if it's bad weather, you just go to W- uh, [LAUGH] Wal-Mart. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, [MN] we just have a regular Wal-Mart, so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, not the super one, we --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I heard they're great and we'd like to get one, but [LIPSMACK] in the --
R:  Well, they're a -- they're -- they're so large, it just wears --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- me out to go there, but it is nice to have so much under one roof.
L:  Right.  And -- and you do get your exercise in. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, you can get your exercise --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- right enough there, with just  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] You get your exercise walking, but not the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the fast pace, because you'll run into other people [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, you're --
L:  -- if you try to do that.
R:  -- you're, uh, not doing quite the 
L:  [SIGH] What you have to do is walk around the outside of the building --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and that -- that would do it, except you run into the trucks in the back, so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that -- that might not be too good.
R:  Yeah, you might get run over, they seem like they're so crowded at our [MN] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- at our Wal-Mart.  But I enjoy walking, I, uh -- I like to just --
L:  It's --
R:  -- take my dog and get out and go through the neighborhood, see who's got what flowers growing and --
L:  Right. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, that way it's um -- you get a different --
R:  [SIGH] Whatever --
L:  -- perspective, you can sort of keep tabs on everything.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And they say that's the best [SIGH] exercise.  We don't have, um -- I guess we -- [SIGH] there was a, [SIGH] um, motel around that did offer, um, use of the pool and that, but I don't know if they still do it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] I know, um, a -- one -- a brother in law did it and, um, he stopped, so I don't know if it, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for what reason exactly he stopped, if it wasn't [SIGH] -- I mean, I like warm water.
R:  Yeah.
L:   I don't -- I don't like to go into water where [SIGH] I'm going to have goose bumps on goose bumps --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and even, you know, getting the exercise to warm up --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it doesn't seem to generate enough --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and --
R:  We belonged to a sports center one year a few years back [SIGH] and they had water aerobics --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I did that, I enjoyed that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] It's a --
L:  I, um, I don't know, does, um, [MN] going in the hot tub or [LIPSMACK] -- count as exercise.
R:  Oh, hot tubs, huh?  Ooh, that sounds good, huh? [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] Does that kind of exercise, um --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- or, um, uh -- we had a daughter down in Florida and she had a hot --
R:  What part of Florida?
L:  In Tampa, outside --
R:  Tampa?  Oh, I see.
L:  -- Tampa.  Yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH] So any time we went down we'd spend a lot of time in there and [SIGH] she's moved back up here and [SIGH] we were talking of getting a hot tub but just never did it. [SIGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And so that wouldn't really be exercise, but it would be, you know, you have to move fast [SIGH] between the hot tub and the house in the wintertime. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] So, that would get the heart pumping a little bit.
R:  Well, a hot tub's good to get in after you exercise.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] And, um, to, um, ease all the aches and pains [SIGH] of everything, [LIPSMACK] walking, gardening or, you know, whatever, but, uh --
R:  Yeah, I have arthritis and I would really  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mm.
R:  [MN] 
L:  Do you have a hot tub, or ?
R:  No, I wish I did.
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] 
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah, they are nice, um --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- but we can't really see spending all that money [MN] for --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- a t- um, figuring that it probably would be good and we'd be in it for a while, and then, you know, it sort of uses its luster and then you've got this big thing --
R:  Yeah, that's us --
L:  -- sitting in the back.
R:  -- we talked about it too and we thought, well, you know, it's one of those things.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] It's a lot of money, it takes up a lot of space and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and we'd probably use it a lot for a while and it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- would probably wear off.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] [MN] 
L:  And you have to be careful of kids --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, getting into it if you don't have it [LIPSMACK] in, um --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] enclosed porch or something, so [SIGH] -- our back yard isn't that big, but my husband makes the best of it with, um, peppers and tomatoes and beans. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, but we have -- [SIGH] aren't having too much luck because of the weather this year.  We're hoping it warms up [LIPSMACK] and then [SIGH] -- then --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- we can maybe, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- once he gets it established then we can maybe go back to the park and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and walk [SIGH] 'cause there's just, you know, a little bit of, um, up and down hilly area and then they have some straight paths and so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you can, um, you know, vary your [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- your speed and your distance and everything.
R:  Well, sometimes it's just hard to get enough exercise --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and particularly when you got bad weather.
L:  Right.
R:  You just, uh -- [SIGH] well, down here --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- and just talking about the weather now, we have another extreme. [SIGH] It gets too hot to do anything --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like in July and August --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean, you have to either go, uh, real early in the morning or -- or if you get out late in the evening, it's usually buggy.
L:  Mhm. [LAUGH] 
R:  So, it's -- it's either [LAUGH] --
