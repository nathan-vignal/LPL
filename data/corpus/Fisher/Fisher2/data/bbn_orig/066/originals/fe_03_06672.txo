R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.  Hi.  I'm Selma Wife[?].
R:  Oh, I'm Deb Conrash[?]. 
L:  Hi. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Hi, this is -- this is my first phone call, so, um, I'm a little --
L:  This is mine too. [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay. [LAUGH] Okay, we're starting off even then.
L:  Could you hold on, I wanna get the other phone that I can walk around --
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  -- with. 
L:  Okay.
R:  Sure.  
L:  [NOISE] [COUGH] [PAUSE] Hello.
R:  Hi. [LAUGH] 
L:  Hi, okay.
R:  Okay, I'm -- so we're going to talk about health and fitness. 
L:  Well, yes, [NOISE] I just came home from [NOISE] Weight Watchers.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I was sick for two weeks with a -- a, um, sinus infection --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and I didn't exercise --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so I gained four p- -- almost four pounds [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- [inaudible] for health and fitness --
R:  I -- are --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you on some kind of a -- an exercise schedule then, so you -- it's something that you do regularly?
L:  I do, yeah.  I -- I belong to a health club and, um, I go maybe five days a week and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I either swim or I do aerobic exercise --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, or something, you know, some sort of exercise --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, um, I can't go and I can't believe I gained all that weight just for -- it was just from not exercising. 
R:  Oh, my goodness. 
L:  Yeah, maybe I ate a little more 'cause I stayed home too, but not --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that much more.  So --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- um, now these calls, you just talk or do you ask me questions or how does this --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- how does this go? [LAUGH] 
R:  Your guess is as good as mine, but I think we -- we have a topic and it's just supposed to stimulate conversation around that topic.  For ten minutes. 
L:  Well --
R:  So ...
L:  -- that's really strange, because I just signed up on the, [NOISE] um, internet [NOISE] last night and I didn't even get a -- a -- a, um, a number or something that you're supposed to get -- a password. 
R:  Oh. 
L:  [inaudible] thinks I was really shocked I got his phone call already --
R:  Okay, well, I got a -- an email -- I signed up yesterday too and I got an email last night with my PIN number and it just said -- it didn't really give me any directions other than you'll be getting phone calls.
L:  Well, you called me, though -- oh, no, they call and they connect both of us, that's what they do?
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  Oh.
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay.  So, you're a volunteer too then and you just --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- talk to one another.  Oh, okay.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- had no idea, I thought you talked to somebody who worked there.
R:  Oh, no --
L:  So, what --
R:  -- no. 
L:  [LAUGH] So, what do you do for [LAUGH] health and fitness? [MN]
R:  Oh, well, um, not a whole lot. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I [LAUGH] -- I -- honestly that's it.  I'm -- I've joined health clubs and I never go and I bought, like, a pilates D.V.D. and I stick it in the player and sit on the couch --
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- and watch it.  I'm just so lazy when it comes to stuff like that. 
L:  Yeah.  Where do you live?  Where are you from?
R:  You know.  From Oregon.
L:  Oh, you're talking -- I'm in Pennsylvania. 
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  But, yeah, but the motivation is that, um, th- the health club -- the people are very friendly, and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I made friends there and that's a big motivation to go.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, um, that's what keeps me, you know, kind of interested because if you -- if you do something with some other people, um --
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  -- you know, you have the -- a little bit better motivation of going.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And especially if they call and they'll say, "Well, I haven't seen you there for a while". [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  So that's a big --
R:  Peer pressure. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- part, yeah, yeah. 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  What -- what -- what about food, do you eat healthy or, um, [inaudible] --
R:  [MN] No.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I have good intentions, but I work during the day and then I teach classes at night, so it's, like, I'll pull through as fast food and go, "What's fastest?" and it's not healthy, but it's all I can do right now.
L:  Oh, what do you teach?
R:  Um, statistics.
L:  Oh.  That sounds boring --
R:  So ...
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes. [LAUGH] It's a lot more --
L:  That's not one of my --
R:  -- fun to teach.
L:  -- better things.
R:  -- [several inaudible words]
L:  That's not one of my --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- better things. [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh, well. [LAUGH] 
L:  [COUGH] Yeah, well, anyway, I -- I do try to eat healthy, but I do like sweets so I -- I -- I eat healthy on one hand, but, um --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I eat sweets on the -- I try not to -- I -- ice cream's my downfall so ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I love ice cream and --
R:  Oh [several inaudible words] --
L:  -- but I don't buy any cakes to bring in the house.  Some, you know, I --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I rarely buy cakes to bring in the house --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I don't eat fast food.  That --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I don't do.  So I'm good in that, it's just that I over -- I eat too much, but, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  So ...
R:  Oh --
L:  Um --
R:  -- a -- la- last year I -- I have, um, internet discussion board and some of my friends, um, were d- doing walking and so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- we all had pedometers.  And we would --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- post -- post the number of steps that we logged every day and that was really fun.  I did that all summer long --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- and --
L:  -- yeah, that sounds like -- that does sound like fun. 
R:  It -- it was fun, because I -- I couldn't believe how many -- how many miles I walked just, you know, regular and then of course [MN] my competitive urge, you know, kicked in and I would --
L:  [inaudible] walk to other per- -- people. 
R:  -- yeah.  P- park in the fartherest parking spot away and -- and walk to, you know, into the mall --
L:  What --
R:  -- or whatever.
L:  Did you walk with other people, too, or did you just walk by yourself and compare, you know --
R:  Just by myself.  Yeah --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and then I'd just, um, [MN] posted it to my bulletin board so that, um, we could all keep track of how, um, far we walked.
L:  Yeah, I did that with swimming once, where you swam a certain amount of lengths and then, um, you, um, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- marked it down and you had to swim to different cities, you know, [NOISE] mileage -- make up the mileage for different cities.
R:  Oh.
L:  And that -- tho- those things are all motivators, you know, so ...
R:  Oh, so that was kind of fun then. 
L:  Yeah, yeah.  That was nice and I also, um, ah, swam -- I swim a lot --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, ah, I also swam on a master's team, but then I got really lazy th- that -- it --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- it ended up that I would go home and either eat all day or sleep all afternoon.  After --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- swimming finishes --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- we'd swim about two miles and, ah, and I'm getting older. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] But, um, I -- I -- I think that y- you have to get somebody to -- to exercise with --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, and then it -- it's just a lot easier like that -- 
R:  It is.
L:  -- so ... 
R:  It -- that -- that social support is so important.
L:  Yeah.  Right, and, um, like I said, I just came back from Weight Watchers and boy, that excercise makes a big difference.  
R:  Now --
L:  Um --
R:  -- in your Weight Watchers group, 'cause I've never belonged to Weight Watchers, do you, um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- is exercise part of the -- of the meeting or --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- do you just talk about it?  Okay.
L:  It's -- it's part -- well, well, I mean they don't talk about it at the meeting, but they tell you, ah, you know, that's part of what you have to do.  You mark down how much --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- exercise you do, so --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- that's part, you know, that's part of it.  Um, I -- do you have a weight problem?
R:  Um, I'm not as thin as I'd like to be, but I'm not, like, [MN] totally over- -- I'm -- I'm probably about fifteen pounds heavier than I should be. 
L:  Yeah, well, um, I'm about I guess ten -- ten pounds more than what I'd like to be, so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I go about ever five years 'cause when I -- I gained the fifteen pounds and then I go ever -- about -- when I gain the fifteen pounds or ten pounds, I go back [LAUGH] to Weight Watchers. 
R:  Oh, that's -- that's a good idea.
L:  And lose it and then I -- and then --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- like, after several years it comes back on again gradually --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so, um, so that's what I do.  Although they say that's not good.  You shouldn't go up and down like that, you're better off to stay --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- thin, you know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I try so, um --
R:  I tried the Atkin's Diet, um, last summer and that works really well for me.  But --
L:  Did you --
R:  -- then --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Go ahead.
L:  [NOISE] [inaudible] article in the paper the other day about the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- Atkin's Diet and it --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- ah, people lost more weight -- course I think they happened to gain it back faster, but they lost more weight on -- on that Atkin's Diet than they did on a regular diet.  But that's not a very healthy diet, you know, and I -- I [inaudible] --
R:  You know, it doesn't seem that way, but -- the -- the research that I've looked at too said that, you know, people's cholesterol levels --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- go down when they, um --
L:  I know, I couldn't believe that.  I saw --
R:  That's so contrary to --
L:  -- that too.
R:  Uh-huh, so I know.
L:  Yeah, I'm so careful, I try not to eat fat because the cholesterol, then they -- then they eat all this fat and everything and they --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- say the cholesterol -- who knows. [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh, I know. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I know. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Ah ...
L:  You know, I -- I have to ask you something.  I told you --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I just signed up last night --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but they didn't give me topics, I don't know how they even, ah, connected us, I -- I didn't even pick a topic or anything. 
R:  Oh, I don't --
L:  But ...
R:  -- think you do.  I think they just give us the topic.  
L:  Oh --
R:  And they have --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- they have, like, a list of topics and then they choose one for us to talk about.  And I have no idea w- -- I don't know anything about this survey, but I think they're probably, um, listening and then tracking how often we go off topic.  But I'm just guessing.  
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know --
R:  So ... [LAUGH] 
L:  I -- I --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- have no idea either.  I -- like I said, I thought that somebody who was doing the study called you and asked you questions.  I had no idea ...
R:  Oh, ha.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  No, it's just -- they pair up two --
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- people that -- I don't know if they match -- matched us in any way, maybe age -- I'm forty eight, um --
L:  No, I'm -- see I just turned, ha, seventy, so they don't --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- match in age either. Yeah.
