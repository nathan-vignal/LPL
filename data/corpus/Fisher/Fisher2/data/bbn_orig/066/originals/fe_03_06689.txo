R:  Hello.
L:  Hello. [NOISE] 
R:  Hi, this is Kathleen in Oregon.
L:  [SIGH] My name is Becky and I'm in, um, Puyallup, Washington.
R:  Oh, just up the road.
L:  So we're both west coasters. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah. [LAUGH] [MN] 
L:  [SIGH] Usually I end up talking in somebody in Vermont or Canada or something, [LAUGH] you know. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, right, right, yeah.  I just finished talking to somebody a while ago in Ohio, so 
L:  Oh, uh-huh.
R:  Oh, interesting. [SIGH] Well, um, health and fitness.
L:  Mm. [SIGH] 
R:  Do you exercise regularly?
L:  [SIGH] No I don't.  I have some health problems which prevent me from doing a lot of exercises, even though I probably should. [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] And my -- my husband's kind of the opposite, he's, uh -- he's [MN] a martial artist and they -- the -- he's been instructing martial arts for, like, thirty five years, so, um, he's [SIGH] -- you know, he does [MN] all his exercises and has different equipment and [LAUGH] --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- [SIGH] constantly after me, but, you know, well, if I have a good day I might do it, but I have fibromyalgia, so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- a lot of time just -- you know, a sustained activity will trigger [NOISE] [SIGH] severe pain, so [SIGH] --
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  Yeah, so it's kind of a --
R:  So, it's -- it could even, uh -- so it -- trying to some exercise would be painful, [NOISE] then?
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, I just -- there's -- there are certain kinds that they recommend to do and of course certain kinds not to do so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and then just sometimes -- you know, just a [NOISE] repeated activity around the house can actually trigger pain, so [SIGH] --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- a lot of times it just depends on what kind of a day or week I'm having. [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. Oh, well, that makes it difficult, then.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, it does, yeah, and it's, uh --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- it's one of the -- one of the side effects is it does make it hard [NOISE] [MN] for people to exercise.  I'd love to be able to do -- [SIGH] do what I used to do before I had all the problems. [LAUGH] [SIGH] 
R:  Right, right, right. [SIGH] 
L:  Used to do a lot of walking and just, you know -- but I d- still do some gardening, but, you know, even that I have to kind of pace myself. [SIGH] 
R:  So, then, you can only do, like, just, uh, small amounts at a time, or ?
L:  Yeah, I can do certain -- you know, just [MN] it's -- I just can't -- like, you know, if I was going to -- if I wanted to plant something small I could plant it, but, like, digging up the whole garden this afternoon, forget, you know. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, okay. [MN] 
L:  Where if I was healthier I could prob- like, I don't say I'd do the whole thing, but I might do [MN] half of it, you know, it's -- we don't have a real big garden, but, you know, just the fact that I just can't [SIGH] do the sustained activities --
R:  Mhm, mm.
L:  -- because of it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] But, uh --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you know, I -- I don't stop doing anything, but, you know, just that the -- what you call the high power exercise stuff I just can't do.  And once in a while -- we live, uh, by the -- we have a [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] trail here by the river real close to our house. [SIGH] Kind of -- it's a city -- [NOISE] you know, uh, run by the city parks and we walk that once -- maybe about once a week if -- when the weather's halfway decent. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mm. [LIPSMACK] 
L:  [SIGH] But, uh, you know --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- to go out and ride a bicycle far or do heavy hiking in the mountains or anything like that, forget, you know. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] So, it's a good thing he has his martial arts as a physical outlet. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right, right, right.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah, interesting. [SIGH] Yeah, so, let's see.  Well, um, [SIGH] I, uh -- well, because of the rain [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I've, uh, learned to do more stretching indoors, I've, uh -- [SIGH] I try to do yoga stretches, so most mornings -- you know, I don't always get up in time every morning but [SIGH] just about every morning I'll get up and do some stretching and then I like to go for a walk and, [SIGH] um, I even have my rain clothes now, so if it's raining a lot of --
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  -- times I'll put on my rain pants and [SIGH] just get all covered up and then just go -- [SIGH] it's not so bad if I know I'm coming home and I can take my wet clothes off and, [SIGH] uh, you know --
L:  [SIGH] Plan for your shower --
R:  -- and get into dry [inaudible] whatever. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- after you come in out of the rain. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right, right, yeah, right, take my shower then, yeah, yeah.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  So, I don't do a lot of walking to work during the rainy season.  I don't live too far from where I work, so [SIGH] I'm able to either walk or bike and, um --
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  -- I have a recumbent bike.  Yeah, yeah. [SIGH] I have a recumbent bike so, um, I -- and I really like using that, um, [SIGH] I -- I think if I had and upright bike I probably wouldn't bicycle and -- but, uh, the recumbents are just so comfortable.
L:  Hm.
R:  Um --
L:  Yeah, it's --
R:  -- it just it's nice to --
L:  Traffic is too busy around where we're at really to think about -- I mean, there are people that do it, but of course if we wanted [SIGH] to ride the trail we could do that too, but, uh --
R:  OH, right.
L:  -- [SIGH] 'cause a lot of people -- uh, the young -- especially younger people -- [LIPSMACK] my husband and I are both just three or four years away from retirement, so we're [LAUGH] [SIGH] certainly -- yeah, we're slowing down a little more than the young kids that are out there on their roller blades and stuff. [LAUGH]  
R:  Right, right, right, right, right.
L:  [SIGH] You have to look out for them, they [LAUGH] --
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, well, we live in Corvallis and so that's a small town and it's really, um, bicycle friendly I guess you'd say, they really --
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  -- encourage bicycles, so it really is, because, um, there are bicycle lanes everywhere, uh, you know, just about, you know, all the busy roads will have a s- a lane set aside for [SIGH] bicycles and then the streets that aren't so busy it's not too bad to ride a bicycle --
L:  Mm.  
R:  -- and people [SIGH] -- there's a lot --
L:  People are [MN] --
R:  -- of bicycles here so people know to kinda keep their eyes open for bicycles.
L:  Ooh, that's good.  Yeah, so you're al-
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- alert and aware and you're out -- you -- you're probably a bicyclist most likely, or somebody in your family, so you're kind of tuned into it that [SIGH] --
R:  Right, right, right, yeah.  Yeah, so, um [LAUGH] -- so that makes it a little bit easier.  I -- I do know that when I get away from Corvallis and, like, sometimes I'm -- I've done [SIGH] a couple of long distance bike rides.  I'm not real thrilled about 'em because I'm a little nervous when we're not in Corvallis because I -- you know, I just don't know if other people are watching out [SIGH] and, um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, some -- some roads that we'll be on'll be kind of narrow and it just [SIGH] makes me nervous that --
L:  I know, yeah, I've done --
R:  -- somebody's just going to come around --
L:  -- they have that --
R:  -- a corner and -- and hit me, you know, it just, uh --
L:  That Seattle to Portland -- one bike race goes through [MN] our -- right down our street and [SIGH] some people are v- you know, very rude and of course I notice s- sometimes the people on the bikes are very rude too, [LAUGH] so --
R:  That's true, yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] but, you know, it's -- it's just like anything, you're -- you -- whatever percentage of each you have in society you'll see out there, but. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right, right, right.  That's true.
L:  But, uh --
R:  That's tr-
L:  Yeah, I know it's -- you know, you have to be alert and aware that they're there.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  Kind of like motorcycles. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm, [LIPSMACK] exactly, yeah, yeah.  So -- [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] but anyway at home I -- I like doing -- you know, sometimes I'll do my errands on my bike if it's not raining --
L:  Oh, that's cool, yeah, I was just --
R:  -- and I don't have too much to carry and, uh -- but like I said it's a small town so it's -- it's real doable.
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Um, but it --
L:  Yeah, we plan, when I retire, 'cause I'll -- probably going to be retiring a year or two ahead of my husband because of my health -- I'm only working part time, I'm working half time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] and when I retire we want to get a -- [MN] get a little dog to keep me company, so I'm sure the doggy will keep me walking [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- which is good really, you know.
R:  'Cause -- yeah, yeah. [SIGH] Yeah, that is good.
L:  Yeah, just because --
R:  Yeah, we, uh -- well, we like to ski in the winter time, we -- that's uh, kind of how we get around [SIGH] not being able to do much when it rains, we'll just go up to the mountains where there's snow and --
L:  Oh, uh-huh.
R:  -- and we used to go up to [inaudible].  I haven't skied in, uh, Washington.  I know [SIGH] my partner has, but I haven't.
L:  Yeah, there's -- there's lots of places up here if you're in -- into it. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, he's skied up there and he's -- he's skied in, uh, BC also. [SIGH] Um --
L:  Yeah, I h- yeah, Whistler or some place like that?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, uh-huh, yeah.
L:  Yeah, I know my former employer --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- he and his wife always used to go up -- you know, like, spend three or four days up at Whistler.  They really liked it up there. [MN] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, that's -- yeah, we're not into, [SIGH] you know, swi- doing any swimming or anything like that either, although we -- well, the river's just basically at our ba- at the end or our back yard is Puyallup River, so [SIGH] -- but it's just a -- it's a [SIGH] -- you know, it's [SIGH] flowing off of Mount Rainier so it's a cold, icy [LAUGH] --
R:  Right, right, right. [MN] 
L:  You know, even the guys that go fishing in the summer time are in their waders up to there [MN] elbows [LAUGH] almost.
R:  Right, right, right, yeah.
L:  But, uh, yeah.  Yeah, so, you know, for us it's just basically w- you know, good bit of what we do in here. [SIGH] My husband did just recently buy an exercise bike and I [MN] actually have been on it a couple of times, so  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, interesting. What did you think about it?
L:  [SIGH] Oh, it was okay, it's just, you know, like anything I have -- I have to pace myself.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, you know, just a --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- matter of -- I should get back -- back on it more than I do, but if I'm just, like, already wiped out when I come home from work [LIPSMACK] it's the last thing in the world I feel like doing. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right, right, right.
L:  So, you know, I mean --
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, once you retire it might be easier, huh?
L:  Oh, yeah, I think so. [SIGH] and his mother, that's what she uses and she's just turned eighty.  She uses her f- she has a [SIGH] stationary bike that she's been riding for years, and so it's --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- kind of keeping her healthy, so I can see that it probably would be [LAUGH] a good thing to be doing.
R:  Right, right.  Why did he get a bicycle and -- as opposed to a treadmill?  Was there a difference?
L:  [SIGH] Oh, we did have a treadmill, uh [MN] he has f- he has found out with his f- own personal experience, he's been trying to, you know, keep his blood pressure down and he finds that it's more effect for him, so that's --
R:  Oh, intere-
L:  -- kind of why he want s a bicycle.  Just -- [SIGH] I think because of -- of -- of the physical stuff that he does, that his heart rate is l- you know, maybe weirder than most people's. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh. [MN] 
L:  And that, um -- yeah, he's -- he's tried them both out, I think, you know, at a regular gym or something and he found out that he can get his heart rate up faster on the bicycle than -- [SIGH] he just doesn't seem to get it on the treadmill.
R:  Oh.  Hm, that's interesting.
L:  So, [MN] in a way, I guess that makes it better for me too.  If I'm not doing anything, I'd better do something that's a little [LAUGH] -- [SIGH] little more sus- you know, little more effective maybe, but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- 'cause I have high blood pressure too, so 
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. [SIGH] Hm, 'cause I've -- I've often wondered about treadmills, I kinda like -- [SIGH] 'cause I -- I don't like running, I don't think it's really that -- for me I don't think it's good for my knees or -- or -- I don't know, there's just something about jogging and running that I just -- I love to walk, but I don't uh -- I don't like to run and I've thought about if a treadmill -- so I can run on a treadmill. [SIGH] I think part of it is just running on pavement [SIGH] and I just don't like the idea of running on asphalt and cement and I --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [MN] wonder about [SIGH] --
L:  Hard on your knees.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  so, I wonder about treadmills if --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- the material that they're made out of would actually be okay --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- to run on.
L:  -- basically what it is is a very -- 'cause we had one for a while and we sold it and it's a very thin rubber belt, so it's not like it's anything heavy, you know, that you're run- actually [SIGH] -- and I don't know if that belt actually contacts, you know, the [MN] metal or whatever that's underneath it, but --
