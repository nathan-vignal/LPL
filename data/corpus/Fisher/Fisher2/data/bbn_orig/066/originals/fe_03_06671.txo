L:  [SIGH] Hello, my name's Martha.
R:  [SIGH] Hi, I'm Jenny.
L:  Hi, nice to meet you. [SIGH] 
R:  Uh, where are you from?
L:  Um, California.
R:  Oh, cool, I'm from --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- uh, Seattle.
L:  Oh, okay. [NOISE] Um, so --
R:  [NOISE] Um --
L:  -- this topic is do you work out. [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN] Uh, no. [SIGH] Do you.
L:  [SIGH] Um, I used to. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Okay, um --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  I -- I haven't much, I, um -- [SIGH] well, before, uh, my pregnancies, I had, um, uh -- [MN] I went to a, um, [SIGH] living well lady.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [SIGH] And, uh, did water aerobics there, like, two or three times a week. [SIGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, since I had three babies [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, wow. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] It's hard with children, huh?
R:  Yeah, do you --
L:  I imagine.
R:  -- have kids?
L:  [SIGH] No I don't, but, uh, uh, I'm -- I'm worried [LAUGH] they'll take my time up. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, one of the things I'm concerned about, of course, is my, um, children's stature --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- 'cause I don't set a very good example for them. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] So, um, [LIPSMACK] -- so I'd like to start [SIGH] --
L:  Start again?
R:  Yeah, uh, doing something. Um, they, uh, have a predisposition towards being heavy, 'cause their dad, my ex husband is, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] is heavy.
L:  Uh-huh.  See, I -- I've always been a heavy girl --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- since I was young [SIGH] and last year I was able to lose a lot of weight, but -- this -- I -- I got married and I went on birth control, and [SIGH] hoop, I went up again. [LAUGH] 
R:  Ah.
L:  [NOISE] And, uh, so now I'm trying to [MN] control it again and trying to go to the gym three t- three times a week at least, but it's very difficult.
R:  Are you doing it, or ?
L:  [NOISE] I, uh -- it's difficult --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- because I have to go to school and I have to work and -- and so it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the time thing.
R:  How old are you --
L:  Um --
R:  -- if you don't mind me asking?
L:  -- twenty seven.
R:  Twenty seven?
L:  [MN] Yes, so.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, I'm thirty eight --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and my kids are, um, four, uh, six and nine.
L:  Mhm. [SIGH] And how --
R:  [SIGH] And --
L:  -- are they in good health?
R:  Um, for the most part --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- other than being heavy.
L:  Mhm. [SIGH] Yeah, because in my family w- we didn't really exercise, or it wasn't --
R:  Neither did we.
L:  -- it wasn't really pushed or, you know, my family's not athletic, I guess, [SIGH] and, so [MN] for -- for me it was, you know -- it was not introduced until I went to college when I started --
R:  [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] 
L:  -- and I really started getting into it and -- and I was, you know, doing the -- the -- the lifting the weights and doing the cardio classes [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and really getting the routine down, [SIGH] and then afterwards I just started stopping little by little.
R:  [SIGH] I heard something about th- that people, um, tend to exercise more when things are fun. [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] So if it's, like, a fun activity, like, instead of being, [SIGH] um, you know, an exercise class, like, some sort of game that you like to play --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [SIGH] or something like that, and I -- I was thinking of that and -- and I was trying to think, there is something that I do -- oh, I like roller skating.
L:  Oh, I -- [MN] I'm afraid of that. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh really?  Did you do it when you were a kid?
L:  [SIGH] No.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
L:  I -- I -- I did it -- I did it twice [SIGH] and then I sprained my ankle really badly, and then --
R:  And then you didn't do it again since.
L:  I stopped after that. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Well, I -- I enjoyed it as a child --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um, [SIGH] [MN] um, my kids' Sunday school class went and, um, you know, the parents were invited to skate for three dollars, and I was like, "Okay, whatever" you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I hadn't skated for, like, twenty years until --
L:  Wow. [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] then, um, but I -- I did okay.  I didn't fall down, you know [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- which was a good thing. [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  And, um -- and I enjoy it. [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  So, if -- I mean, the idea, I think, is that I've got to find an activity for myself and my children [SIGH] that isn't work.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, you have to still have fun. [SIGH] Um, about -- I think it's about two years ago, I -- I was doing martial arts --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and that really helped me a lot, uh, with my flexibility, losing a lot of weight.
R:  And did you find it fun too?
L:  It was fun.  It was harder work b-
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because I was heavier than everybody else, so I haven't -- you know, it took me twice as long, [SIGH] but it was a lot of fun.  It was challenging but it was fun and everybody was very supportive, I think that helped a little.
R:  [SIGH] See, my -- my -- I'm especially concerned about my youngest, uh, child, because [SIGH] it seems like he doesn't have, um -- [SIGH] and -- and part of it I think is safety and security because we split up --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] my husband left me and -- and left him --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- uh, you know, because that -- part of the leaving is leaving your children, when he was, um, [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] just, uh, two years old --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and, so, um, [SIGH] h- he -- [MN] I think, he -- he doesn't have a sense of when to stop eating.
L:  Yeah. [MN] 
R:  [SIGH] And so when, um, when I look at him, [SIGH] his stature is such that he's way heavier than a- any [NOISE] child his age.
L:  [SIGH] Well, my -- my sister -- I think all my siblings are also obese -- I guess they were -- I don't know -- [SIGH] I don't know exactly where you draw the line of obesity or heavy weight, because everybody has a different perc- perception of what it is --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] but they -- they're all, uh, big people.
R:  Right, and see, my ex husband, [SIGH] um, he's a big man --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- very big man.  Even if he were -- [SIGH] well, he -- see, [SIGH] since, um -- since he started going to the gym daily and --
L:  Oh. [SIGH] 
R:  -- working out and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, making himself more attractive to ladies, [LAUGH] you know --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- [SIGH] then, uh, he's -- he's actually lost quite a bit of weight --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [SIGH] but, um -- anyway.
L:  [SIGH] But -- but I think it's also more -- for me it -- it's more if I fix my psychological issues --
R:  [SIGH] Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  -- and I start feeling better about myself, I think I work out better --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- or I do it harder.
R:  [SIGH] Is working out the answer, though?  I mean, or is dieting?  I mean, I've never dieting, I don't like dieting.
L:  Um, [SIGH] actually, my dieting consists of eating about five meals a day, but they're very small --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but I don't deprive myself of anything.  So, it's not --
R:  Well, that's good.
L:  -- it's not really dieting I guess, 'cause, yeah, I don't think diets work --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- really, [SIGH] but I think of what you eat, like I'll --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I'll try not to eat as many [SIGH] like chips and soda --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, and -- and try --
R:  And try to eat healthier and stuff.
L:  -- [MN] try to eat healthier, but if -- if I really wanted a [MN] bag of chips, I'm going to eat it, [LAUGH] you know.
R:  [SIGH] But maybe you'll buy a smaller bag rather than the big --
L:  Yeah, I'll buy a smaller one, or --
R:  -- industry [MN] -- industrial size. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Yeah, and it helps that my husband's in the military --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he has to watch his weight now.
R:  [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] Because it's part of his job requirement.
L:  Exactly, and he's getting -- you know, he -- he's thirty four and it's -- for him it's a little bit -- it's getting harder to lose the weight.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, he's also -- you know, he has to watch it, so b- between both of us [SIGH] we're more conscious of what we eat and, [MN] you know, we support each other. [MN] 
R:  [SIGH] Well, you see, I've been about -- within thirty pounds -- thirty, forty pounds of the same weight since college, [SIGH] you know, it's --
L:  That's not bad.
R:  -- it's up and down and that's --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that's about -- um, I graduated in eighty seven from college --
L:  Uh-huh. [MN] 
R:  -- so, um, I weight, um -- [SIGH] I hate to say it, I -- I look thinner --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- a lot of it's water weight. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Well, you know what?  Muscle's heavier, [SIGH] because when I started losing weight, I -- I was starting to get heavier in terms of --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- the scale, so --
R:  That's an interesting thought.
L:  Yeah, because, um -- [SIGH] and my best friend's a personal trainer --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so I would ask him, "Why am I gaining weight and -- if I'm losing it?"  So he would tell me that because you're forming muscle, [SIGH] muscle's a lot heavier --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so the first -- the first couple of weeks you might tend to gain weight [SIGH] but then you lose it.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  But my size -- I was [MN] dropping sizes.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm. [SIGH] Well, I -- I've, um -- [SIGH] I was, like, a hundred and sixty in college --
L:  Uh-huh. [NOISE] 
R:  -- but I would wear a, um -- you know, a size nine, or size nines or tens, you know, 'cause I was, uh, [SIGH] slimmer --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- than most of the people who, um, weigh a hundred and sixty, typically --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] and now [LAUGH] I'm, like, um, [SIGH] you know, I -- I was kind of depressed after my husband left and so I dropped about twenty pounds so, um --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- but right now I'm gaining [SIGH] -- uh, I am gaining it all back. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah --
L:  [SIGH] I know, it's just -- as long as it's in the right places. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I -- my tummy's getting a little, um -- [MN] a little worse than it was --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- but it -- I w- I'm about maybe one ninety five. [SIGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- But, um -- but I s- I wear, like, um, larger --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, large pants, extra large, um, top.
L:  You see, but the -- I hate clothes that -- clothes because large is very small now. [LAUGH] 
R:  I know that.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I know that. [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] And that's very frustrating for me personally --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- because I know I'm -- I'm -- right now I'm a size sixteen.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I went all the way down to a size almost ten --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- so again, you know, I'm working my way down again [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  -- but [MN] a lot of clothes it's -- it -- they're larger and it's large and I don't fit and normally [SIGH] I would.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  But it depends on what store I go to that I'll fit into the clothes. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Right, it's true --
L:  But --
R:  -- it is true.
L:  -- that's very discouraging. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I know, I know. I -- I, you know -- [SIGH] I don't know what to think about my kids, [SIGH] it's an issue. [SIGH] 
L:  You don't -- you probably -- probably have to be just really supportive --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and make things fun.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, I think, I think.  More just active times. [SIGH] 
L:  Mhm.  Like what we -- my husband started doing, we started [SIGH] for a -- we have little dates [LAUGH] and we just -- we go hiking or we go bike riding.
R:  Where in, uh, California do you live?
L:  Uh, we live in southern California.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, we live in Anaheim, so it's not that far from the beach, about half hour.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So --
R:  I think my brother lived there w- um, for a while, in Anaheim.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  He worked at Hugh's.
L:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, and that's right there, isn't it?
L:  Yeah, it is, actually. [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah, that's right, so then -- then I'm right, he lived there.
L:  Yeah, so, I mean, that's what we --
