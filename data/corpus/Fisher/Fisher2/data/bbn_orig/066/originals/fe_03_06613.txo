R:  Hi!
L:  Hi!
R:  Hi, my name's Donna.
L:  Hi, I'm Carissa.
R:  Hi, Carissa.  
L:  How are you?
R:  Okay. 
L:  Ah, --
R:  Where do you live?
L:  Ah, Atlanta, Georgia.
R:  Oh, I'm in Canada, in Toronto. 
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  So, what was the question?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Um, do you believe that private or public schools should be able to control what children read?
R:  Mm.
L:  Um, --
R:  It's hard, I only have one in school at the moment, so --
L:  Um, mine are in preschool -- mine --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- is in preschool.
R:  Okay, well, I have -- I have a fourteen year old in grade eight, and the other one's twenty one, so --
L:  Oh, goodness!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mine's three, so, ah, --
R:  Oh, what a wonderful age --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- sometimes -- [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I do day care, so I have lots of little kids around the house.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, what's your -- what's your take on it?
R:  [SIGH]
L:  It's kind of a hard subject.
R:  Yeah, it is, isn't it?  I -- no, actually, I think it should be -- some of it should be censored.
L:  Um, --
R:  -- I mean, I wouldn't want my kids reading, you know, porn, or --
L:  No.  No.  And -- yes, and that -- 
R:  -- or something like The Exorcist, or --
L:  Right, right. 
R:  -- you know?
L:  In that respect, yes, um, I think it should, but, as far as some of the things that I read in school, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, I would have to say that no, I don't think that, you know, everything should be censored, --
R:  No.
L:  Um, --
R:  -- I mean, it's really -- it's like going to the movies, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, some of the stuff they say isn't for kids, really, they could watch it, and -- and vice versa.
L:  Right, right.  Some of it --
R:  You know, some of the adult stuff shouldn't be watched.
L:  Right.  And -- and -- you know, you don't want to draw the line and -- and not let 'em --
R:  No.
L:  -- and shelter 'em too much, --
R:  No, 'cause up here right now, um, oh, maybe a year or so ago, one of the classics was being put on a list that the kids couldn't read.
L:  Right, and that's where I think we should draw the line.
R:  Yeah. Yeah.
L:  Um, because, you know, [LAUGH] it's the real world, and --
R:  It is.  It is -- maybe we should let the teachers decide whether it's appropriate for the class that they have.  
L:  Right. Definitely.
R:  You know? 
L:  Right.
R:  But I don't think it makes any difference whether they're in private or public.
L:  No. 
R:  No.
L:  It doesn't.
R:  No.
L:  No, I think that, um, I think we can control, um, more things, ah, with them being in private, meaning that, um, you know, more of a say-so, maybe -- maybe I'm not making sense, but, um, -- certain things i- in pub- -- in private schools, they can kind of determine what's good and what's not -- I don't know.  Maybe I'm --
R:  Do you -- d- do you think that maybe the parents should have a say in it, too, if they really don't think their child should be reading that book?
L:  Oh, definitely.  I think --
R:  You know, we'll let the rest of the class read it and your child can read something else?
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  You know, there, I mean, there's lots of -- you know, different -- [SIGH] I don't know what it's like down there, but [SIGH] we have kids from every country in our neighborhood.
L:  Wow.
R:  Um, my son [MN] is white, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- well, we're white, um, but the area we live in, there's, like, fifty six different nationalities in his school.
L:  Wow. See, --
R:  I mean, I think there's only two or three of them in the whole class that are white.
L:  Yeah.  We, we, um, --
R:  You know, we have --
L:  -- we're not in the same situation, --
R:  Yeah, we've got lots of orientals, and, um, Indian, and Islamic, and Tamil, and -- and I mean, they -- their religion's really, you know, --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- um, there might be a lot of stuff that we would say would be okay, but their parents would be -- it would be a definite no no.
L:  Right, right.  And that's hard.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Different ah, religions, different --
R:  Yeah, sure.
L:  -- beliefs, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ah, now, we're not -- we're, we're very sheltered --
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- um, we are, and I think that sometimes that's a bad thing.
R:  Yeah, we -- it's just the area of the city that we live in, um, I look after kids who come from, maybe ten or fifteen, I was going to say kilometers -- um, miles away -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- you know, it's, like, about a twenty minute drive from where they live out in the suburbs coming into the city.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Now their kids -- they- they're all white kids that they go to school with.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They don't have, um, you know, any of the Indian or -- or Chinese that we have in our area, --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- so, you know, it -- it -- it is, it's definitely the area.
L:  Yeah.  Which is -- which is hard, --
R:  But I've grown up in this area, so [LAUGH] we're used to it!
L:  Right, right.  
R:  But people coming from out of town, it's, like, "Ah!".
L:  Yeah, --
R:  But, yeah, you know, --
L:  -- yeah, culture shock.
R:  -- they have to be really careful, I mean, even when they do their sex ed now at school, they have to send pa- -- letters home to all the parents, because some of the girls that are from the Islamic families are not allowed to take it.
L:  Wow.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  And -- and then that, -- I'm sure that that follows along with, you know, what they're reading.  [LAUGH]
R:  That's right.  That's right.
L:  And -- and, what they can discuss.
R:  Yeah, now, I -- as I said, in grade eight, there's not a great deal that they're reading that they wouldn't be able to, but I bet by grade ten or eleven, --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- um, things'll change.
L:  Oh, definitely.  For --
R:  I can't remember what we read back then; but --
L:  I -- I can't either, -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's been too long.  [LAUGH]
R:  Bet it's been longer for me!
L:  [LAUGH] well, um, well, we had ah, you know, a big discussion about teaching evolution in school not too long ago here --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in Marietta --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it was on national news; --
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- um, and my father was a big advocate [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- he was on CNN few times, --
R:  Really?
L:  -- talking about -- yes, he was, he's all for teaching it, --
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- and, um, that was, that was difficult.  'Cause you know, you -- you have how many kids in one school, and parents thinking all different ways, and wanting certain things to happen, and --
R:  That's right.
L:  Oh, you have to find a happy medium.
R:  You do, you do. 
L:  And my --
R:  Are your kids going to go to a public school?
L:  Um, we have not --
R:  Decided yet?
L:  -- well, my husband swears that, um, that our daughter will continue to go where she's going now, she goes to preschool at a -- at a Christian --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- a- at a Methodist church, --
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- and, um, they have a Christian academy there, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he swears that that's the only place that she wants -- that he wants her to go, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but, yeah, we live in an area of, um, of Atlanta that -- people move to this area just because of the schools, and I feel, like, --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- wow, you know, we have such an opportunity where she can go to a free school, -- [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  That's right.
L:  -- that we paid high taxes for, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, and, and the -- and the high school, um, that she would go to is the -- is the best in the -- in the States.
R:  Wow.
L:  -- so, um, I don't know, -- I -- I have, I have a friend that was a school teacher, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, and she says, "Don't send her anywhere except for public schools unless you have a problem", so --
R:  Right, --
L:  -- so, --
R:  -- it's difficult.
L:  It is -- hard decision -- and when your twenty one year old was going to school you didn't think twice about it, did you?
R:  No.
L:  Yeah.
R:  No, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, not at all, [MN] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's a little different now, our public school teachers are all working to rule at the moment --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so the kids have had, since the middle of March, they've had no after school activities --
L:  Wow.  
R:  -- before or after school, um, they've missed out on track meets, they haven't been going on any trips, um, the kids' graduation is in jeopardy at the moment.
L:  Goodness.
R:  Um, our Catholic school teachers [LAUGH] are actually -- have been locked out.  So, our Catholic school kids haven't been to school for two weeks.
L:  Oh, my --
R:  I mean, it is a mess up here at the moment! [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.
R:  Um, the Government's really screwing up our education system, and, --
L:  Oh, that's terrible --
R:  -- and the teachers are fed up.
L:  Yeah, --
R:  Yeah, yeah, so --
L:  I don't blame 'em for that.
R:  But I don't think the kids up here in private schools are any better at the moment, so --
L:  Goodness.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's terrible!
R:  It is, [LAUGH] it sounds awful, I mean -- it's not always like this! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, thank goodness.
R:  But, I mean, my -- our -- our kids have, [MN] you know, a fab- -- they have fabulous teachers, --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and, um, our schools are so well equipped, --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- that, um, and they get lots of, you know, lots of opportunities that -- that I didn't get when I was in high school, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, or junior high, and -- beautiful computer labs, and, --
L:  Yeah, that's one, you know, that's, --
R:  -- you know?  Yeah.
L:  -- that's definitely a benefit, in, --
R:  It is.
L:  -- in going to schools, and, you know, and then you -- you don't even really think about --
R:  No.
L:  -- that aspect of censorship, --
R:  No, no.
L:  -- until somebody brings it up. 
R:  Yeah.  But I mean, even, we have to think about it when they're on the internet all the time.
L:  Oh, well, that's even scarier, because --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- there's so much out there, you can type in one word, and, you know, something pop up that --
R:  You don't want! [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right.  I know, it's very scary.
R:  We've just blocked one of those! [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, I -- I -- I did that the other day, I was looking for something and then what came up was, like, "Oh, my gosh!"
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  So -- and I know, [MN] having a little one, I mean, I know that [MN] she gets on
