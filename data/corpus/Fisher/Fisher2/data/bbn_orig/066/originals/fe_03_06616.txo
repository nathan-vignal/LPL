R:  Hi, this is Sharon from Maryland.
L:  Hi, this is Caroline from Chicago.
R:  How are you tonight?
L:  Pretty good.  How about yourself?
R:  Ok- okay, how'd you find about this?
L:  I think it was on the internet.
R:  Okay, 'cause I read a magazine called, ah, Refunding Makes Sense.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, just seeing if some of the people we- we've been calling into -- do you have children in school?
L:  Uh, no, I don't.
R:  Currently, oh, okay.  Um, I have two young preschoolers, so, that's why --
L:  Oh, preschoolers.
R:  Yes, they're young. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And hopefully, I'm going to be able to talk for nine more minutes without being interrupted.  Which would be good.
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  Ah, so --
L:  Have you been doing this for a while?
R:  Um, just the past week.  
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  I-I found out through the internet, also, through, like I said, this RMC, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it's -- it's a bunch of us, refunders, or [MN] people who, like, cut coupons, it's, like, a whole cult of us here. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh!
R:  Trying to save money --
L:  What's your website?
R:  Ah, refund --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- cents dot com.  
L:  How do you spell cents?
R:  Um, cents, like, money, --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- C.E.  so it's R.E.F.U.N.D. C.E.N.T.S. --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- dot com, -- 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- and we -- we trade, you know, how to save money, and cut coupons, and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and do all -- you know, lots of ways to -- test drives, and stuff.
L:  Oh, well, I'll check it out.
R:  Ah, yeah, you should, it's -- it's a really good site.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Um, anyway, what was the topic again, books, --
L:  Censorship.
R:  -- [MN] was it books, oh, banning books.
L:  Censorship, right?
R:  Yeah, basically, and, ah, whether they priv- -- public or private schools should ban books.
L:  Well, I think they should ban some of them, don't you?  
R:  Um, well, --
L:  Adult topics?
R:  -- I guess, it depends.  Oh, definitely, adult topics, I-I don't think Maxim belongs in the school.
L:  Right.  [LAUGH] Or Hustler, --
R:  Hustler, --
L:  -- you don't want Hustler in the preschools, do you?
R:  Oh, definitely not, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- um, you know, I think there's some that, ah, even Glamour Magazine, even some of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- those anymore, are just, you know, the front page of some of these women's magazines now have, --
L:  Well, they're teaching the kids to dress in these, ah, mini tops, and, ah, the low rider jeans, you know, --
R:  Yeah, I have a four year old going on fourteen, and -- and, I'm [inaudible] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- already getting worried, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- um, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- about some of these, um, I guess, you know, I gu- -- are they worried about, what, Catcher in the Rye, I guess, I hear, you know, um, you know, because it has some curse words in it, --
L:  Well, --
R:  -- I mean, that's --
L:  -- you know, Kill a -- Kill a Mockingbird has got a rape in there, too, and, ah,  um, --
R:  And that's considered a classic.
L:  Right.
R:  Ah, --
L:  -- and so is Catcher in the Rye.  
R:  Right.
L:  So, --
R:  Ah, I mean it's so many years, thousands of years, since I've read them.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I mean, I think they're okay for high school children, you know, --
R:  Right. 
L:  I don't know.
R:  I think it should be appropriate for the age group, I guess, is, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, --
L:  -- I, so -- I-I would agree that, ah, censorship is age appropriate --
R:  Right.
L:  -- for -- in the schools.
R:  Um, yeah, you don't want, you know, kindergarteners reading Catcher in the Rye, or, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, they -- they should, um, I guess it was a lot of the Judy Blume books, I remember as being kind of, you know, in junior high school, that was even a little racy, 'cause they kissed, or, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, and some of them even got to a little more --
L:  Well, this is a different age now, --
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  -- way beyond kissing now.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I know, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and that's what's kind of scary, too, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, I have a sixteen year old stepson, --
L:  Oh, uh-huh.
R:  -- who we have partial custody of, --
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- so, he comes to visit every [inaudible] now and this is some of the, you know, --
L:  What he's into, yeah.
R:  Yeah, it's very different world.  You know, I've known him since he was four, --
L:  So, --
R:  -- so, it's interesting, growing up, kind of --
L:  He's a sophomore in high school, then, right?
R:  He, actually, he's a junior. He'll be going into, this --
L:  Oh, junior.
R:  He's, ah, he's -- he'll be seventeen when he graduates.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  -- so, he'll be a little young.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  He was put in -- he -- 'cause his birthday's on the cusp, kind of, um, --
L:  Now, do they censor any of his, uh, reading material?
R:  Um, as far as I know he's never really talked about that at all, or, you know, I haven't heard any of it.
L:  Do you know what type of assignments he has to do for homework?
R:  Um, no, not really, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because, like I say, he -- he kind of lives far, he's in Virginia, he's in Norfolk, Virginia, which is probably about six hours from us?
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  Um, so he comes up for the major, like, the ho- -- like, Christmas, he's here, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he's here most of summer, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, yeah,  he doesn't look at a lot of books, unfortunately, we don't get to talk about books, mostly it's video games and, the big movies, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- trying to keep him busy, um,  I send him to camps and stuff, trying to keep him --
L:  Oh.  
R:  -- entertained, --
L:  Out of trouble, -- [LAUGH]
R:  -- yeah, because, you know, unfortunately, yeah, he doesn't really have an interest most -- reading -- books per se. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, then again, you know, we don't get to try him mostly for -- except for magazine articles.  [LAUGH] That's --
L:  Well, --
R:  -- the extent of my reading, any more.
L:  -- yeah, and I would, no, I love reading. I love reading everything, magazines, newspapers, ah, books, you know, I just, that's one of my hobbies, is, ah, reading everything current.
R:  Mhm.  Oh, that's good.  Well, -- 
L:  And I'm only, ah, I'm only --
R:  Well, you don't ha- -- you -- children. [LAUGH]
L:  Pardon me?
R:  You don't have any children at home right now, then.
L:  No, they're all grown up and all, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- on their own.
R:  So you can have more time to do such things.  
L:  But I'm -- I'm just about, ah, five miles away from that high school where the hazing incident took place, 
R:  Oh.  Mhm.
L:  -- so, that's one of our neighborhood high schools.
R:  Mm.
L:  And, um, --
R:  Well, I'm kind of happy to hear that they did suspend -- or some of the students couldn't -- 
L:  Oh, they're all expelled.
R:  -- they couldn't attend graduation and stuff, and --
L:  Right.  No, they were all expelled.
R:  They definitely were, good.  Um, --
L:  -- and I think there was five of them that, um, didn't want to sign the petition, so they are going to go ahead with their lawsuits.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Um, they had a sign, like, a petition, that, um, they would perform community service, and, uh, --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- all of these, um, uh, criteria that the school wanted them to meet before they could, um, be awarded their, um, graduation certificate, you know?
R:  I guess I don't understand why -- [MN] what grounds are they suing for, since they're the ones who are injuring other students.
L:  Um, probably they're just, ah, --
R:  I'm just confused.
L:  -- you know, that the girls did complete the, ah, course work, and all that, and, --
R:  Oh, I see, yeah.
L:  -- it was the end of the year, and, um, ah, anything that happened outside of the school, -- however, I -- the school did say, at the beginning of the school year, they -- they have to sign a -- this, um, honor, um, petition that they're going to follow, not, uh, put any, um, bad, um, publicity, or whatever, on the school, or, you know, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- always hold their -- themselves up to, ah, high respect when in public, or --
R:  Oh, I like that.
L:  -- you know, things like that.  They have to --
R:  Mhm.
L:   -- every, um, senior has to sign that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- at the beginning of the year, and I gu- --apparently, these girls did sign it, but [LAUGH] I guess, when you're out with your friends and, you're drinking beer, you know -- so --
R:  Parents have, [MN] you know, have given to them --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- which was really surprising to me, too, but, --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, that's old fashioned me, I guess, but, um, it's just, I guess, amazing, from my high school days, yes, I wasn't necessarily being proud or anything, but, you know, have they gone so far, you know, like, the teen sex, and the -- you know, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- this -- are they getting that from these -- you know, from these books that shouldn't be in their class.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I'm sure, I'm sure, you know, the -- like you said, the magazines, and everything and, --
R:  Um, --
L:  -- you know, you got Britney Spears on the cover, and, ah, you know, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and Christine Aguilera, --
R:  Yeah, she's --
L:  -- with the mini tops, and, ah, these outfits that they wear on stage, you know, and, uh, the kids think that's the way to go, you know?
R:  Right. [MN]
L:  I mean, in my day, it was, um, Annette Funicello, and, ah, you know, [LAUGH] Frankie, Frankie Avalon, that was --
R:  Right.  I kind of like those days, that, you know, --
L:  -- on the beach, [LAUGH] you know, on the beach party, that was, ah, --
R:  I think I would have been more, you know, that's what I'm fearing, is, you know, when is my -- but probably by then, my six year old is going to want, yeah, belly shirts, and, um, --
L:  [LAUGH] right.
R:  -- you know, because then that's what they're showing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for six and seven year olds. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, you know.
L:  So, --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- censorship does have a place, as I said, you know, with the age appropriate. [COUGH]
R:  Right, and to a certain degree, I think as if they're eighteen, and can make an informed decision, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, I don't think -- I guess I haven't read, I would want to read, you know, they're talking about banning -- say they're talking about banning Huckleberry Finn, you know, --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- well, let me reread this and get an idea --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, you know, I don't recall anything, you know, besides, there's a little bit, of -- 
L:   Racial or --
R:  -- back then, racial undertones, or, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- where, but that was the time, too, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- back then, you called -- black people were called, you know, darkies, -- 
L:  Yeah.  Well, --
R:  -- and, um, I got in --
L:  -- civil rights didn't happen until what, the seventies?
R:  Right.
L:  You know, th- they used to have a separate, uh, drinking fountain and, ah, then, you know, for -- down South, you know, --
R:  Well, I think that's why they're having problems with that, is that teaching them, I'm, like, no, that's more of a history lesson, 'cause, yes, that's what happened back then, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, that's the way -- actually, I bought an antique, ah, sewing machine a couple of years ago, and inside was a letter from ninety thirty something, --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- that whoever owned it, wh- -- you know, it was stuck up in there, and she called -- you know, she was saying about the darkies, and they were out drinking, and --
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  -- and it was -- it was -- it was really interesting, because back then, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, it was a pretty wild letter.
L:  Wow, you should that to the Antique Roadshow and, see if --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's worth anything.  [LAUGH]
R:  I wonder if it is worth anything, knowing my luck, though,
L: [LAUGH]
R:  -- it was some poor pauper woman or something, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- had had it, but, I don't usually get such things, but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- um, like you said, I think the sexual [inaudible], I guess, is what I'm more worried about, and are kids growing up too fast.  But, um, some of your Judy Blume stuff, and, you know, ah, I remember reading, you know, oh, those are the good parts, you know, where they actually, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, necked, or, you know, and, you know, like you said, it's, I think, age appropriateness -- yes.  Dr Seuss belongs in the elementary school, and -- but does not necessarily belong in the high school.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, they don't want to read Dr. Seuss in high school, but, um, I don't know, just --
L:  But I think that, ah, high school, y- y- you have to open -- expand your mind, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and you can't, ah, you know, censor because of these racial things that happened in the past, --
R:  Right.  
L:  -- you can't censor that, from, ah, you know, the high -- the teens learning about this, 'cause they have to know about this, --
R:  Well, I --
L:  -- they have to know that the Holocaust happened, you know --
R:  Right.  W- well, I think I've heard that so- somebody was
