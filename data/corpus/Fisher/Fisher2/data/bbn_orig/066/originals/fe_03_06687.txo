R:  Debbie.
L:  [NOISE] Julie, hi. [NOISE] 
R:  Hi, Julie.
L:  How are you? [LAUGH] 
R:  Good, how are you?
L:  [SIGH] I'm okay. [SIGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Oh, okay.
L:  [MN] [SIGH] Um, I don't know, I'm too lazy to exercise, but I know I should.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  You think about it all the time, but you don't do it?
L:  Um, yeah, basically.  I have, like, [inaudible] books where you just use, you know, two and five pound weights and isometrics and dynamics.  I have all the tae bo tapes. [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.  Do you think tae bo tapes work?
L:  [SIGH] Um --
R:  I mean, not -- not tae bo, but, I mean, like --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- any tape? [SIGH] 
L:  [NOISE] I think that -- you know what?  When I had my oldest daughter, there used to be --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- program on television, like, an exercise program --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] and I -- every day, you know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I would sit there and do the exercises and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] I lost, you know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um, all the --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- baby weight really quickly.
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  So, I think --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- they do work if you follow them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The tae bo tapes are really hard though, for me --
R:  Oh, they are, you know, because I felt [SIGH] -- I had something happen to my arm and I think maybe I had a weakness in my arm but [COUGH] [SIGH] at one point it just kind of --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- dislocated, it came out of socket --
L:  Really.
R:  -- and I was doing nothing simple, just putting on my coat, and it just -- my arm just froze [SIGH] and I thought about the tae bo that I had done maybe, like, weeks before and I was like, [SIGH] "You know, they're right, [MN] uh, if you're a bit strenuous it can hel- it can hurt you".
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, I just -- well, you know, I tried it couple of times and [LAUGH] they said [SIGH] it -- there's, like, a point in one of the beginning tapes where he says, "If you feel like taking a break, take a break and join back in later".
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  [SIGH] And I took a break and just never joined back in. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Wow.
L:  [SIGH] So --
R:  [MN] [LAUGH] [SIGH] That's okay --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- that's -- that's -- you probably found a reason not to go -- I mean, [MN] to do it, but [SIGH] --
L:  It's just too hard.  I was just like [SIGH] --
R:  Y- yeah, it -- it is strenuous, I mean, it -- I think if you had, like, the inspiration to go to a studio and work out doing that it might make a difference [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, 'cause [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] I think sometimes working out with other people [SIGH] or being in that environment helps --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- as opposed to being at home isolated, [SIGH] trying to motivate yourself --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- to do something productive as far as your body goes.
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] Well, my motivation would be to look in the mirror and see these handles that I --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- did not use to have --
R:  Well --
L:  -- you know what I mean? [SIGH] Like --
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, yeah, I know what you mean, I know what you mean because [LIPSMACK] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- because the [inaudible] or somehow her husband complains that --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- she's not what she used to be and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] and he wants that back and men are visual and, you know --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- he -- it can --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- matter, but --
L:  I think my honey said something.  I remember he said something to me like that once.  I have an almost three year old, [SIGH] and I looked at him and I said, "Hm, your stomach wasn't that big when I met you".
R:  Wow.  Well, [LAUGH] that [LAUGH] that's what m- married life --
L:  [LAUGH] I said, "You lose yours --"
R:  -- is too. [SIGH] What?
L:  "-- you lose yours and I'll lose mine".
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] Good show.
L:  So --
R:  That's a good bet, you know.
L:  You know, it's like, "Hey --"
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  "-- if it -- y- y- you know what?  If you look the same then every -- you know, it's not -- [SIGH] we can't all be Victoria's secret models" --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- just like our guys --
R:  There you go.
L:  -- [SIGH] it's like, if you're a guy and you don't look like a T.Q. model --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- there is no reason for you to say anything [NOISE] to a female --
R:  Right.
L:  -- about how sh- her -- her weight or anything, that's --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- how I feel about it. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] It's like, "Unless you're perfect, don't say anything to me" and I wasn't being mean --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [SIGH] but it was just like, "Um --"
R:  [MN] Well, you --
L:  "-- hello, I had a baby --"
R:  [MN] But --
L:  "-- what's your excuse?"
R:  -- you know, guys think they're just fine the way they are.  You know, they're like god's gift, big stomach and all.  And -- [SIGH] but they -- [SIGH] you know, they can accept themselves and [LIPSMACK] women are much harder on themselves because they want to be Miss Perfect [SIGH] which may not be that attainable and, um [SIGH] -- it -- so it -- it's -- it's like -- I don't know, it's -- it's -- it's like what society puts up for, you know, women -- [SIGH] and there are some men that are getting into, um, [LIPSMACK] it, because I have a friend and he's talking about maybe -- he -- he's concerned about his stomach.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] "Tell me about -- maybe I should get liposuction". [SIGH] I said, "Well, you know, [SIGH] that might work" but because, you know, he's older and, uh, I don't think the exercises he -- I don't think he'll be able to do it, you know, get it off, so some men who are really concerned about [SIGH] their abs and whatnot [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, the exercise, it can only do so much.
R:  [MN] so, what do you think about --
L:  -- where --
R:  -- like, people going the route of plastic surgery versus --
L:  If I could afford it, honey --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I would do it.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] If you have -- and let's just look at Cher. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  If you have the money and you can pay for it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and you can do the personal trainers [NOISE] [MN] go for it, honey, there is --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Right.
L:  -- nothing wrong with that.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, um, [SIGH] I don't -- I don't think [NOISE] that it's really cool for people to go get in all this Botox and [SIGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and stuff like that because there is -- you know, to me, there's not enough studies out on that for me to trust it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH] But I know liposuction, all they're doing [LIPSMACK] is sucking all this crap out of my --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- stomach. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right, right.
L:  [SIGH] And, you know, my weight is way ba- is back down to what it was, it's just that [NOISE] it's not -- [LAUGH] it's not in the same place it used to be. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, wow, yeah.
L:  [SIGH] You know.
R:  Yeah.  do you have one child?
L:  I have four.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Mhm.
R:  All right.
L:  [SIGH] So --
R:  [SIGH] All right.
L:  -- I'm nineteen, fourteen, nine and two.
R:  [SIGH] Oh, oh, good gracious, okay. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I was like --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- "Spread the pain".
R:  Yes.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Do you exercise, or ?
R:  [SIGH] Uh, you know, mm, I think about it all the time. [SIGH] I do -- [SIGH] I told my friend today, I said, "If I do a stretching before I go to bed, I feel like I've done good".
L:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] Hello.
R:  [SIGH] And -- and, uh, the thing is, like, when I was younger, I used to, like, [MN] oof, active, stretch, exercise, play. [SIGH] Now things are a bit different, I'm feeling my bottle -- body a little bit different, a little achier there. [SIGH] Um, but I find that if I stretch out my ham strings, j-
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- just, like, touch my toes or something like that [SIGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- my muscles thank me.  'cause it -- I -- I tell 'em it's, like, [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] if we don't do that they atrophy --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] they shrink, [SIGH] we -- that makes us get smaller [SIGH] -- us shrink and get smaller [SIGH] and I recently ordered, um [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] -- I haven't put it up yet, I [LIPSMACK] called someone to assemble it for me, it's um -- [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] it's and inversion table.  It's not, like, an exercise thing, but I'm going to hang upside down because I was feeling a particular pain from my hip and --
L:  You want to stretch?
R:  -- and also -- [SIGH] stretch, yeah, take me the other way.  So, I'll hang upside down so -- [SIGH] and that might get me, um, you know, inspired to d- do other things 'cause -- have you ever, like, bought exercise equipment? [SIGH] Or not equipment, but just something [LIPSMACK] and you don't use it, I mean, you -- you -- you --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- use it first. [SIGH] It's like having a toy.
L:  [SIGH] Yes.
R:  [SIGH] You use it at first and then it gets stuck in a corner somewhere.
L:  Do you remember that -- that chair that they had on TV where you --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- put your arms up and you kind of twist and blah, blah, blah?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I can't remember what the name of it is --
R:  It's --
L:  -- it's like the myadic[?].
R:  -- [SIGH] it's kind of ab --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- twister?
L:  The ab roller.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  No, it's not a ab roller, it's -- well, it's -- yeah, you know what I'm talking about, it's a chair with a --
R:  Yeah, I do, 'cause you know what?  I -- I went into, [SIGH] uh, a car shop and [SIGH] and the guy -- the mechanic said, "You know, you see this chair? [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] I haven't used it once.  It -- it's not worth nothing and I don't use it".
L:  It cost two hundred dollars.
R:  Wow.
L:  It's a piece of crap.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I swear to god.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH] And it was just, like -- and you know what?  My boyfriend asked me --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- what I wanted for my -- for Christmas --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and that was what I wanted.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And go in there and there --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- was -- there's no resistance --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- you can't adjust it --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- to make it any resistance --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [SIGH] and it's just [NOISE] -- and it -- what the -- for two hundred dollars, the only tape that comes with it [SIGH] is a --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- tiny little beginning tape.
R:  Okay.
L:  You know, uh, the chair itself is probably worth forty bucks.
R:  So, it's a gimmick, it made [SIGH] [COUGH] -- you know, it did what it needed to do, [SIGH] make money, get people to think it -- you know, it will really help them, [SIGH] um, but the --
L:  If you can't feel any resistance, then it's not helping you. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, well --
L:  [SIGH] You know what I mean?
R:  -- but you got to be consistent using it, you know, it's like --
L:  Mm, [LIPSMACK] no.
R:  -- [SIGH] y- y -- I mean, do you want to have pain from the beginning.  I mean, you how they say no pain, no gain, and like they say, feel the burn and -- [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah, you have to burn.
R:  -- but do you really want to feel that a lot and then you'll -- you know, you'll need to have m- body massages --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- which I totally am for.
L:  You have to burn a little.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, you do.
L:  You know, what I mean?  There's no -- it was just like -- it's like sitting in your kitchen chair --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- putting your arms up in the air in a v- a U and then just twisting your waist --
R:  Yeah, well, I mean --
L:  -- this [inaudible] a fact.
R:  -- you could do that with -- you know, without that device --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- you know.  Uh-huh.
L:  And, you know, so why did he spend -- I had him spend two hundred dollars on a piece of crap.
R:  Something you wanted, something that appealed to you at the time and now you've got to get rid of it. [SIGH] 
L:  Mhm, [LIPSMACK] I know, my friend keeps bugging me for it, I'm like, "Oh, yeah, come and get it". [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] What -- [LAUGH] yeah.  You know, I, um [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] -- I saw these video t- ha- have you ever bought it -- video exercise tapes --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- besides tae bo?
L:  No, just the tae bo tapes.
R:  Okay, I -- I saw this one -- [SIGH] like, I belong to this book of the month club and [SIGH] anyway --
L:  [COUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  --they were advertising this [COUGH] -- four piece --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- video set, and then I looked at it and I'm like, "No, I'm --"
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  "-- not going to get it".  Then I saw it advertised again somewhere and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and I thought about it, I'm like, "you know what? [SIGH] I have video exercisers that I would -- [MN] the last one I did buy [SIGH] I mean, this -- it -- as first it started out good and then this woman was getting real intense, I said, "Maybe I could do with the fight" you know, just got --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- really ready, you know, mentally and physically --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] um, [LIPSMACK] but I -- I -- you know, it's, like, a person has to know when to know when to stop themselves, um, [LIPSMACK] I think exercising is good, like I say, I'm all for stretching and [SIGH] I do, uh, a --
L:  You have to stretch before you exercise, anyway.
R:  Yeah, yeah, and, uh, I b- I do something kind of like the tai chi thing and the --
L:  You might do pretty well with yoga, though.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, I though ab-
L:  A lot of people do yoga and Pilates now --
R:  Uh-huh, yeah.
L:  -- and that's -- that's a lot of the stretching and --
R:  [SIGH] Now, have you seen that Pilates machine that they have? [SIGH] Does it --
L:  [SIGH] You don't have to have a machine to do Pilates.
R:  [SIGH] N- no, no, no, but there's a machine -- [SIGH] okay, I saw it --
L:  I haven't seen one.
R:  -- [MN] and I saw another machine and this -- they're trying to copy Pilates.  You know, Pilates has --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- this machine where you could do all these exercises, like row [SIGH] and with your legs and just all kinds of things --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- this oth- this other --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- one is called, um, [SIGH] a g- a -- a -- a Gyrotonic[?], and it was in, like, um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I think it was Elle magazine I -- this --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- month, Elle, [SIGH] and I looked it up over the internet and I s- interesting because [COUGH] it's about fifteen hundred dollars [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] and --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- I was like -- yeah, and I'm like, you know [SIGH] --
L:  I [LAUGH] --
R:  -- uh, I -- and -- and for [inaudible] to certify, I mean, they're -- they're --
