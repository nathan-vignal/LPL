L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  Ah, all right, so, ah, have you done this before?
R:  Yes, I have.  This is actually, this is my second call, though.
L:  All right.  Likewise.  Um, --
R:  My -- my name's Mary Jane.  [LAUGH]
L:  Hi, my name's Carmen.  Um, --
R:  Hi, Carmen.
L:  -- hi, nice to meet you.  Ah, so, ah, censorship, and, ah, books in schools, right?
R:  Yes.
L:  All right, so, how do you feel about it?
R:  Um, well, I guess, it's only fair to tell you I teach second grade.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, wow, --
R:  -- in a school, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I [SIGH] -- I, it's a -- it's a tough subject, um, because, I mean, there are certain things that I wouldn't want my kids to get a hold of, well, like, at -- our fifth graders, we caught some of them with Playboys in their backpacks, here, a couple of weeks ago.  I mean, obviously that's not school material, but, you know, it's still censorship inside the school because they brought something that was inappropriate in to school.  Um, as far as, like, classic works of literature, um, I guess, Harry Potter would probably be a good one, since a lot of, um, people were kind of up in arms -- a lot of the religious groups and such, when his first -- when her first book came out, because it dealt with witchcraft and sorcery and stuff, and several of the religious groups were against it.  Um, I didn't see anything wrong with it, you know.  Would I have read it out loud to any of my classes?  No.  Because at the time, I was teaching third grade and now I'm teaching second and, I just don't think that it's appropriate, um, material for that age level, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but do I think that --that the library at school should have it available for them to check out at their own choice?  Absolutely.
L:  [MN]
R:  I mean, I think it's a classic piece of work, I think it's in  the fiction section for a reason, because, I personally don't believe in witchcraft, um, I imagine if you did believe in it, it probably would be scary.
L:  Huh.
R:  But --
L:  -- do you --
R:  Go ahead.
L:  No, go on, finish.
R:  No, no, I'm monopolizing, so go right ahead. [MN]
L:  Well, um, what about books that, like, -- you know, books that have, like, previously been banned, and, like, now, they're no longer banned, or, like, --
R:  Like what?  I mean, I can't think of --
L:  Um, well, like, I know there's, like, lots of controversy about Huck Finn, like, it's been on reading lists for years and years and, now, like, I mean, definitely, like, now, in, I don't know what you call it, two thousand, but, like, in today's time, people are much more racially conscious than they were, like, before, like, I pulled out an old copy of Disney's Peter Pan, and I was, like, "Oh, my God, they could never, ever, produce something like this nowadays", 'cause there's a scene, where, like, you know, all these little kids are sitting around, and this, like, Indian chief is, telling these stories, but it's -- it's so very, oh, very, like -- there's so many -- many stereotypes that are put into, like, this whole, like, production of this Indian chief telling them a story, like, down to, like, how he's speaking and how they're dressing, and, like, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, li- -- so, like, people are so much more, like, sensitive about these issues, and sensitive to these issues nowadays.
R:  Yeah, but, I mean, the whole thing with, with, um, Tom Sawyer is -- I mean, it's -- it's a masterpiece the way he went between so many different dialects and different tones, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that you can hear those tones come out, you know, in -- in the writing, which is what I wish my -- m- -- the writers in my classroom would do.  Is, is --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to do that.  But now, what I -- what I have a struggle with, is, -- okay, I was reading, um, a book out loud to the class, and it's called Because of Win Dixie, and this is a book that is very much acclaimed, it was on the -- you know -- like, all of the new young readers', ah, you know, like, it was picked by, -- I think it -- it was either a Caldecott or a Newbury, it was, you know, one of the award winning books here a few years back, it's a wonderful book, but there is, you know, a poi- -- a point in it where there are a few swear words.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I'm reading this out loud to the class and I'm, like, thinking to myself, "Now, if I don't say the word Hell, technically, I'm censoring the book, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because I am not presenting the book the way the author intended it", because the -- the line was, "War is Hell t- -- pure Hell", and it was this woman that had a very Southern, thick accent, and then, the kids go, [SIGH] "That's a swear word, in the book" and she goes, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- "Well, war ought to be a swear word".  You know, and, -- so then, I -- you know, here I am, I'm r- reading it out loud and I'm, like, forgetting that this was in the book, because I haven't read it in a while, and I'm thinking, "Now do I -- do I read this out loud, because if I don't, then I am doing just what the topic asks, censoring things in the -- in the school system", but, at that point, you know, I had to make a decision and, I went ahead and did not read the word, because I just -- I felt that second graders aren't mature enough to hear that word and know that that was the way the author intended it, but yet it would have gotten all their attention and they would have forgotten about the story, and the only thing they would have remembered was that Mrs Slaughter said a bad word in class.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I chose to censor that, because I felt that I would have been doing more harm to the author by saying the word than by not.  Now, by coincidence, like, the week after I finished that book with my -- reading it out loud to my second graders, my third grader came home from school and he had that for literature circles where, like, five or six kids all have the same book, and they're all assigned, like, two chapters each night to read, and then the next day they all have a job that they have to do, whether it's to pick out, you know, like, important passages, or to find a connection between the book and real life, and he got to that part and, he's, like, "Look mommy, there's a swear word in there", and I said, "Well, what happened, wh- -- how did your teacher, you know, address that?"  And he just said, "Well, she just said that it wasn't a swear word because it was in the book.  That it's a swear word if you choose to use the word, but, if it's in the book, then, it's, you know, part of the book".
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I was, like, "Oh".  Okay, so, she didn't actually have them, like, reading out loud, so it's not like they read it out loud, in front of people, but, the thing about the censorship issue that kind of gets me more is, the internet scares me to death, in --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the classroom, and I had asked, um, my first year in the classroom, you know, I said, "Is -- is there some sort of, you know, protection that you can install in the computers to make sure that -- because, Whitehouse dot com is not Whitehouse dot org", --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and apparently, they're supposedly very different.  [LAUGH] um, and as long as the kids know, you know, like, a couple of catch words, they can get just about anywhere, um, in fact, one of the other schools that I was at, um, they didn't have a good enough system in, and what they had done was they had, um, programmed or set all the computers' home pages to go to an, like, a online casino, or something like that, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like, one of the Las Vegas casinos that had, you know, like, showgirls dancing across the screen, and they completely shut our computer system down at school for, like, an hour or so, until they could figure out, you know, where it originated from, and -- and get it reset and stuff.  But, I mean, I think there -- I think there needs to be commonsense, I think that, um, -- I think classes -- classic pieces of literature were written at the time that they were to reflect the thoughts of the era, um, -- I don't think that by dancing around history you do any favors, I -- I mean, I think it's important that I explain to second graders that there was a time in America when we were so silly that we thought that you could buy and sell other people.  I mean, I tell them that that was wrong, that was very wrong, but, if we don't know about the mistakes that we made in the past, we could make had same kind of mistake in the future.  So, just pretending that a mistake didn't happen doesn't make it go away.  It just means that you're not acknowledging it, and therefore, possibly, didn't learn from it.  I mean, it's okay to make a mistake in life in general, but, if you learn from the mistake, then it's not a mistake, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- then you've learned -- learned an important lesson.  I mean, it's like I tell my kids, "You learn more from the things that you get wrong on your paper than the things that you get right.  You have to get it wrong, then you look at it and go, why did I get that wrong, where you could have just guessed at something and gotten it right and it's not going to stick.  But if you get it wrong, you're going to remember it.  And say, why did I get that wrong and, figure it out".  So, I mean, I -- I agree that, you know, Tom Sawyer is
