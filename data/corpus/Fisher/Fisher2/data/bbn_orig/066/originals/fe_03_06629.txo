R:  Hi, I'm Deedee.
L:  I'm Sally.
R:  Hi, Sally!  Where are you from?
L:  Virginia.
R:  Virginia?  What part?  So am I.
L:  Fredericksburg.
R:  Fredericksburg, okay, we live in Harrisonburg.
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, we're talking about censorship, now Sally, this is an unusual situation, because I, um, happen to be in the grocery store with my brother in law,  I'm visiting my mother in law, [LAUGH] so, -- when the --  when I got the call, so it's a conversation in a grocery store, so, ah, pardon me if I get a little distracted.
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  But, ah, we'll do this.  We will do this.  [LAUGH] So, we're talking about censorship today, huh?
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and whether -- well, what do you think about, uh, schools, do they have the right --
L:  About the books?  Um, --
R:  Huh?
L:  -- well, maybe not the schools, I think that that's the parent's job.
R:  I really do too.  I do too.
L:  But, then, again, you know, so many parents are not -- don't seem to be [LAUGH] involved --
R:  Mhm.  Mhm, I hear what you're saying.
L:  -- they don't seem to be taking control, you know?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Do you have children?
R:  Do I have children?  Yes, I have three.  Um, ages seven, five, and almost three.  And actually --
L:  Yeah, I have a nine year old, and --
R:  Do you?  Okay.  Okay.
L:  You know, at that age, I don't, I mean, we don't have too many problems with him trying to read smutty books, you know, --
R:  Mhm.  Right.
L:  -- might have to watch more what he's watching on TV.
R:  Exactly, I know what you're saying. [inaudible]
L:  -- Mhm, but yeah, you know, there's -- you know, [LAUGH] really, what's the difference between the books they read and the TV they watch?
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I mean, you know, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't think that that's necessarily the school's job.
R:  That's true, that's true, I don't feel, like, um, the school can -- I mean, I think they can have a suggested reading list, now, I have don't have any children at public school because I -- I home school my children, um, not for that reason, but, um, I think they can have a suggested list, but I don't think that a child should be punished if a parent determines that's something that their child should not be reading, you know what I'm saying?
L:  Right.
R:  Um, like you said, I think the parents', the parents' job to do that, --
L:  Right. [COUGH]
R:  -- and I think that the parents should be -- a parent's decision should be respected.
L:  I mean, and, you know, in general, most of the required reading --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, is not, you know, I mean, I've never, [COUGH] I mean, you know, like, they have to read Shakespeare, --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I mean, personally, I'm not a big Shakespeare fan, [LAUGH] but, you know, --
R:  Okay! [LAUGH]
L:  I can, --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I can understand why, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- why they -- they read it, you know.
R:  Exactly.
L:  But -- yeah, I don't think that the school necessarily -- now, I mean, and I can see maybe the school not actually stocking certain books in their library, --
R:  That's right.  That's right.
L:  -- but I mean, you know, like, I personally, I started reading romance novels when I was young, --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- you know, and they had love scenes in them and everything.
R:  Right.
L:  -- but, I mean, I didn't get them from the school library.
R:  Right.  I see, I see what you're saying.  I see what you're saying.  What about, um, I think there've been some controversies as to -- and I think, you probably alluded to that, the -- um, the choice of books, I think -- I -- you know, my personal opinion, from what I've heard, I mean, the choice is kind of, kind of scarily liberal, you know what I'm saying?   I mean, they have some books in there, it's, like, whoa, wait a minute.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] You know, do I want my elementary age child even exposed, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, "Whoa, we can't do that! Oh, have you seen that book?", you know what I'm saying?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  It's, like, a big deal, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I remember a few books back when we were, um, when I was -- see, I -- 'cause I'm -- I'm thirty, just turned thirty four, so, it's just a little while back.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, you know what I'm saying, I -- I don't know.  Um, -- that's [inaudible] --
L:  Yeah, I -- like I said, I -- I can understand the school, [COUGH] you know, as a parent, you know, naturally, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you'd get upset if your -- if your child brought home, you know, a book that --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- was real inappropriate --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- from the, from the school library, or something, but, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, from, uh, -- from the school's point of view, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't think that they have the right to stop --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a child from reading --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know what I mean, too -- so many times there's cases where people read things into things.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- you know, I mean, look at how many controversies there's been over Disney movies for little crazy stuff.
R:  Right, right.  You're right, right.
L:  You know?  [LAUGH]
R:  And I'm like, yeah, we're fighting over Disney, but I mean, good grief, I mean, they're the least of our concerns, you know --
L:  Right.  
R:  -- what I'm saying?  There's plenty more stuff out there we could be talking about.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and that's what I'm saying, you know, I think that you -- you can find -- you know, a pessimist can find bad in anything.  [LAUGH]
R:  Anything, that's right, if you're looking for it hard enough.
L:  -- and, you know, unfortunately, I think there's a lot of those in the world.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, wow.  It's an -- it's an interesting thing and, I think, ah, it just keeps -- this controversial thing -- this kind of controversy doesn't die, you know what I'm saying?  Um, --
L:  Well, it's -- yeah, and I -- I think, actually, I think it's -- it's getting more and more active, because of, you know, you have, now, you have so many conflicts between what's a parent's job, and what's --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- the school's job, and, you know --
R:  Yeah, the lines are really blurred, aren't they?
L:  Oh, yeah, and I think --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you know, and I do, I think that, you know, an- and -- and unfortunately, not everybody agrees --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, [COUGH] you know, I think that, too many cases, the parents aren't taking an active enough part in the upbringing of their children.
R:  Yes, yes, I can see that, I can see that, it's come to let a lot fall on the shoulders of those who are at school.
L:  Right.
R:  The teachers and administrators, yeah, I understand that, I understand and, ah,  they have a tough job, of trying to determine, okay, for those parents that are not as vigilant as, say, someone like you, you know what I'm saying, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we have to -- I think they're still obligated to protect the kids, which I can understand, you know what I'm saying?
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- 'cause they know not every parent is going to be highly involved.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So, very interesting.  [LAUGH] very interesting.
L:  Oh, yeah.  That's definite.
R:  Still I have to -- I have to ask you a question, I know this is not on our particular subject, but is this, like, the first call you've done, or the third one, --
L:  Oh, third.
R:  This is your third?  This, um, this is my third too.
L:  Yeah?
R:  This is my third message. [inaudible] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's why I was, like, I told Anthony, my brother in law, I said, "I got to take this call, 'cause this is my last one, you know, I want to make sure I go ahead and make sure I complete everything". But, ah, -- 
L:  We can only do three?
R:  Huh?
L:  Oh.
R:  To do three, mhm.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Mhm, I mean, not only three, I mean, 'cause I -- I have a great time doing this, you know, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if they want to send me some more, that's fine. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, I do too.
R:  Yeah, yeah, so you're in Fredericksburg[?].  Okay, have you lived there all your life?
L:  Um, most, since I was -- well, I'm thirty nine now, --
R:  Okay.  
L:  -- we've lived here since I was four.  So [LAUGH] --
R:  Okay, okay, pretty much all your life, then. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  My -- my husband and I live in Harrisonburg[?], I'm actually from Hampton, Virginia and, he's from up here in northern Virginia, and we met at college.
L:  Oh, --
R:  Yeah, so, and we dated all through college, got married, and we've been here for t- -- about ten years, -- 'cause we've been married, it'll be ten years in September, so, --
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  Yeah, it is.  It is, been a, it's been a blessed ten years, very blessed.  So, ah, we're, we're enjoying -- life, ah, goes at a -- a slower pace in Harrisonburg, Shenandoah Valley, you know, it's just kind of different [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- than anywhere else in Virginia.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- but I don't mind, I don't mind, with the three children, that helps, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, but you definitely have to slow down when you have children.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, your life changes completely. [LAUGH]
R:  It really does, [MN] you know, I don't have kids -- they can sympathize, but tell -- 'cause I remember, I was I'm not quite understanding it, before I had kids, you know:  Now I'm, like, I totally understand what people are saying.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  It really does change your life, change your life, but, ah, for all the struggles, you know, all the -- all the things [inaudible], like wow, at the end of the day, you're, like, man, this is cool.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I often look at my husband and, go, "What did we ever do with our time before we had kids?"  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  'Cause it seems like we have so little of it now, you know what I'm saying?
L:  I know.
R:  -- but, ah, very interesting, very -- and, so, you have a nine year old, is that what you said?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Right.  Boy or girl?
L:  Yes, I'm happy to say, he's an excellent reader.
R:  Oh, yay!  Yay, so you have time!
L:  You know, he's -- as a matter of fact, he reads above grade level.  So --
R:  Does he?
L:  -- [COUGH] he reads, he just finished reading the book Holes, as a matter of fact.
R:  Okay.  Okay. 
L:  And he reads --
R:  You're not proud, are you, momma.  You're not proud, are you?
L:  So -- no, not at all.
R:  [LAUGH] not at all, okay.  [LAUGH]  Oh, that's fantastic.
L:  Mhm.  [COUGH] Yeah, he reads Harry Potter, and, you know --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, now, did you get him interested in books, I mean, are you a -- a reader yourself?
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Well, I've read to him from the time he was real, real tiny.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, and he's an only child, so, you know, --
R:  Oh, --
L:  -- he gets all of my time and attention --
R:  That's right, that's right, I was an only child too, so I know what that's about, I know what that's about.
L:  Well, I --
R:  That's probably why I grew up to be a reader. [LAUGH]
L:  -- wasn't. [LAUGH] 
R:  That's probably why I grew up to be a reader. That's neat, that's neat.  He gets all your time and attention.   That's cool, --
L:  Some of it, yeah, --  
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, and I -- I -- I've, I've never actually run into a situation where he wanted to read a book that I didn't think was appropriate, --
R:  Appropriate, okay.
L:  -- you know, or that the school didn't think was appropriate, you know, --
R:  Right.  Right, I got you.  I got you, well, that's good.  That's good, and I know he -- he -- you'll cross that bridge when you -- when you get there.
L:  Yeah, I mean -- and I'm sure you haven't had any problems with anything like that yet, either, I mean --
R:  Mhm.  My kids, I think, are a little bit too [inaudible].
L:  -- that's -- I -- I would say that's probably when they're older, you know?
R:  Yeah, yeah, 'cause my kids are just -- a wee little bit [LAUGH] slow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- probably like adolescent, you know.
R:  Yeah, yeah, I'm sure --
L:  Couple more years. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm, mhm yeah, it's not too far off for your young man, is it?
L:  No.
R:  Man, probably a little closer than you would like.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, much closer --
R:  Man, --
L:  -- [LAUGH] than I'd like it, actually.
R:  Yeah, I know, I know, and I've heard so many people say, I mean, they try to remain positive about teenage -- you know, the teenage years, but they say that it's -- it's a different set of challenges, it really is.
L:  Yeah.  It's --
R:  Um,
