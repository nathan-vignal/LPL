R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, my name is Gwen, I'm in --
R:  My name's Roche- oh, go ahead.
L:  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm in southern California.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Uh, in --
R:  I'm -- I'm Rochelle and I live in Arlington, Texas. [SIGH] 
L:  Oh, wow, the last person --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I spoke to was in -- I think was from Texas.
R:  Oh, okay. [SIGH] Um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I guess about fitness.  I don't really --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- exercise regularly. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Uh, I -- I just --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- started taking a class about two months ago with my mother in law --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [SIGH] and it's -- [NOISE] it's a little bit [NOISE] -- I don't know if you what [NOISE] the -- what [NOISE] tae bo is? [NOISE] It's --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- [NOISE] with Philly -- it's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- with Philly Blanks but it's similar to that.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, I do that once a week --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and I have an elliptical machine at home --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that I --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- never see to have time to get on.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, but I do want to start --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- doing that also.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  Um, just because, uh, you know, I want to improve my health and [SIGH] I have a little two year old --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- and I want us to -- I want her to see me exercising so, you know, she -- not that she gets in the --
R:  She d-
L:  -- habit of it, but, you know, she's around it and [NOISE] when she --
R:  Is aware of it.
L:  -- grows up -- right. [NOISE] 
R:  I do -- [MN] I have a two year old, uh, or a two and a half boy -- year old boy and I just had [SIGH] another one that's three weeks old. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, my --
R:  So [LAUGH] --
L:  -- goodness gracious.
R:  -- I d- I do want to start, you know, doing, you know, the postpartum exercises [SIGH] and to get back into shape from [NOISE] being pregnant which --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I -- [SIGH] I didn't -- you know, I'm -- I'm very careful of my pregnancies that I don't gain [NOISE] that much, but, you know, you still have that, um, tendency to have the -- [SIGH] the weight that you don't want [LAUGH] so --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- [SIGH] I do -- I do want to -- um, in my hospital, they, um -- [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] they offer a fitness program, like, postpartum --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- fitness program [SIGH] that's -- your first, um, six weeks are free and then you pay for afterwards and if I enjoy that I plan to continue that [SIGH] because it's, you know, free childcare on top of that, [SIGH] so [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, wow, that's great.
R:  -- [SIGH] and -- yeah, [SIGH] so that's -- you know, that's kind of, um, one advantage is that it's free childcare and it's, um, you know, during the day that I can go and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- stuff like that, so [SIGH] that's, you know, one thing that I'm looking for after my six weeks' period --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um, but right now, you know, they [SIGH] tell you not --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- do anything --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [SIGH] until after six weeks, [SIGH] so, [SIGH] um, that's kind of one thing I'm looking forward to. [NOISE] 
L:  Did you exercise at all --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- while you were pregnant?
R:  [NOISE] Yes, I [NOISE] --
L:  Oh.,
R:  -- I did, um, jazzercise. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, that's great.
R:  I don't know, do you all have [NOISE] -- I don't know if you all [NOISE] have that up there or not? [NOISE] 
L:  Um, not really --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- but I remember it because --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I grew up on the [NOISE] east coast and I --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- remember they had it there.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, okay, yeah. [NOISE] So, I've --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um, I did that [NOISE] when I --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- was pregnant, but --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] [NOISE] it's not -- I enjoy [NOISE] it, um it's not as --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- strong a fitness as exercises that I want to do. [NOISE] [SIGH] Um, you know, it's just kind of --
L:  But at least it's something. [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, it was --
L:  It's moving around. [NOISE] 
R:  -- something to get me through my pregnancy because it was --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it was low impact and, you know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they didn't really, [NOISE] um, the doctor really [NOISE] didn't stress about, [SIGH] [NOISE] you know, your heart rate going up or anything --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- like that because of it being so -- such low impact. [NOISE] [SIGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  So, that was kind [SIGH] what I did during pregnancy [LAUGH] and then --
L:  So, that's --
R:  -- yeah, [SIGH] so, I don't know, [NOISE] um, [NOISE] I don't know what else we're supposed [LAUGH] to talk about. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] I don't know, um, let's see.  Yeah, other than -- I mean, I'm sure [LAUGH] we --we both get enough chasing around two year olds --
R:  [SIGH] Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and now you carry on. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that -- that's exercise in itself. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] I was going to say --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I know she's -- I don't know how much yours weighs, mines, like, about thirty three pounds --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- [SIGH] and I'm -- like, I should be as skinny as a rail for the amount of --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- weight she is --
R:  Is -- [SIGH] yeah.
L:  -- I mean, [MN] you know, carrying her around all the time. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Mine's a [MN] healthy two and a half year old and he's forty two pounds --
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  -- um, he's [MN] just real tall.  He's been in the ninety five percentile since birth, [SIGH] um --
L:  That's like my daughter.
R:  Yeah, he's just tall and, um, you know, just kinda -- not [SIGH] you know, stocky, you know, not fat, stocky, but he's stocky.  He's, [SIGH] um, built like my husband's side of the family --
L:  [SIGH] Like --
R:  -- and --
L:  -- her jamboree teacher says, "She's solid". [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] That's what they tell him at, um --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- his mother's day out program. [SIGH] That's --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- just a solid boy. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] and, [MN] [LAUGH] he's a -- he's a solid boy. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, um -- and then this one, our -- our recent one, you can kinda tell that he's going to take after my side of the family and be [MN] -- [SIGH] he's going to take after the tall side but be [NOISE] real s- um [NOISE] that's a star [NOISE] -- oh, that's a batman? [NOISE] [SIGH] Um --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- he's going to be, [NOISE] you know, real tall [NOISE] and petite. [NOISE] You know, just kind of, um, [NOISE] [SIGH] thin boned, [NOISE] you know, sm- [NOISE] 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- smaller boned. [NOISE] 
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, okay, that's a batman car. [LAUGH] Sorry.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [LAUGH] Um, so, [MN] um, you know, it's kinda, um, [NOISE] funny how -- [SIGH] and they're [NOISE] totally [MN] [NOISE] two different personalities [LAUGH] already. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, [LAUGH] no.
R:  So [NOISE] --
L:  Already, at three weeks? [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] Huh?
L:  [LAUGH] I said already at three --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- weeks, huh?
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, [SIGH] yeah, you can tell.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I could just tell the difference, um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] my -- my first son didn't [MN] really sleep very good, [SIGH] and this one wants to sleep all the time. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  [SIGH] Day and night, so it's like, "Wow, this is kind of a change". [LAUGH] I get to sleep --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] you know, quite a bit, versus, you know, what they did, so --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, you're lucky.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, [SIGH] um --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- I don't know, I guess [NOISE] -- the subject.  Um --
L:  Um, so that -- [SIGH] well, do you -- do you do any walking at all?
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, we walk every evening [NOISE] now that, you know, we're [NOISE] -- we mostly do it [SIGH] [NOISE] close to [NOISE] [MN] d- daw- [MN] dark, because, um [NOISE] --
L:  Uh-huh, so it's not too hot.
R:  -- [NOISE] because it -- yeah, [LAUGH] [NOISE] it's hot. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah, out here it's -- it's, like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- we're driving --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- around now in my car --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and I have the air conditioning blasting because it feels like it's, like, a hundred degrees outside.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  You know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and, like, I -- I would sit there and I would take her walking during the day if, you know, I wasn't going to be sweating [NOISE] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, the entire time from the time I stepped outside my door --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to time you walk back in.
R:  We live about -- we live about two miles from the lake, so we usually walk down to the lake and [SIGH] let, um, [MN] my two year old [NOISE] play at the [NOISE] park and then [SIGH] [NOISE] we walk the two miles back home, so that's about, you know, [NOISE] four every, [NOISE] you know, day, on top of [NOISE] -- no, you're not going to talk --
L:  Oh, well, yeah, that's --
R:  -- on top of --
L:  -- exercise.
R:  Yeah, [NOISE] um, [NOISE] but I'm looking for [NOISE] you know, more [NOISE] without these kids [NOISE] exercise. [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] So [NOISE] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Oh.
R:  So, [NOISE] [MN] um --
L:  Um --
R:  -- [NOISE] what? [NOISE] [SIGH] So, um --
L:  So, yeah --
R:  -- it's kind of [NOISE] --
L:  -- I --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] I don't know what else we're supposed to --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- I'm -- I'm not sure --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- what else to talk about. [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] [NOISE] Is this your first time doing one of these, or ? [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] This is my third one.
R:  Oh, is it?
L:  so, I think they say that -- I don't know if you're --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [MN] they're doing more than three for some people or what, but, yeah, I've -- oh, like, I've gotten --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- calls before but I've been out and been, like, in the middle of doing something and I haven't really been able to talk.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, this is my third one I did.  I did one last week, and then --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the other one I did was, like, a month ago.
R:  Oh, okay, okay.
L:  Is this your first one?
R:  [SIGH] Um, this is my second one.
L:  Your second one?
R:  Yeah.
L:  What did you talk about last time?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Uh, family. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [SIGH] So, yeah, it was kind of an interesting one. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, [MN] appropriate.
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] [NOISE] and it was, um -- it was, like, four days after I came home from the hospital, so [SIGH] it was [LAUGH] kind of, [LAUGH] [MN] you know, one of those ones that [NOISE] you know, like, "Well, let me tell you, I'm not sleeping too well, and " [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] So -- [NOISE] but it was an interesting one, I could actua- you know, [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] I --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- could, you know, really relate to that one, so  [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And then, uh --
L:  Yeah, my --
R:  -- [SIGH] I did --
L:  My last --
R:  -- one -- [MN] I wanted to do one, um, and it was about children [LAUGH] but I couldn't --
L:  Oh, that would be a good one.
R:  -- uh, yeah, I couldn't do it at that time, [LAUGH] so, [SIGH] um, [LIPSMACK] that's the one --
L:  [NOISE] You know, the last one [NOISE] I did was about current events, and how do you --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- how do you keep up with them.
R:  [SIGH] Oh, okay.
L:  So that one was a good one because there was lots options --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- a lot of different things you --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- could talk about.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  But, um, yeah --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- exercising, I guess it's because --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I mean, like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- not really active --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- as far as --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I mean, one, there's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- work, 'cause I -- I work too --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- so it's -- it's -- better for me I have less time --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  -- but, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, and I don't like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- to have any kind of sports activities that I do, you know, like, bowling -- I used to do bowling --
R:  [MN] Oh, okay.
L:  -- but I haven't had time any more but it's, you know, -- it's -- it's almost like [SIGH] whenever I'm not working, you know, I probably want to spend the time at home with my family.
R:  Right, right. [NOISE] 
L:  And so --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE] I'm a -- I'm a stay at home mum, so I, [NOISE] um, basically just [SIGH] chase the kids all day. [LAUGH] So --
L:  Yeah, I wish I could do that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- but we can't afford it though.
R:  [NOISE] Y- yeah, it's -- [NOISE] [SIGH] it's -- it's hard [NOISE] but, um, [NOISE] we seem to [NOISE] kinda make do.
L:  But I mean the -- the lucky thing is --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [MN] part of w- part of what I do, I'm able to take her sometimes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, that's part of the reason I started doing what I'm doing now.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] Well, that's good that you're able to, [SIGH] um, [NOISE] kind of involve her also. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah, it's just sometimes --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, we -- we may end up being out all day so then I feel bad and like, "Oh --"
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  "-- she's not getting her playtime".
R:  [NOISE] Oh. [SIGH] Yeah. [NOISE] [SIGH] Um, [NOISE] let's see [NOISE] what else can I --
L:  But --
R:  -- say? [NOISE] Um [NOISE] [LAUGH] --
