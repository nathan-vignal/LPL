R:  Hello.
L:  Hi!
R:  Hi! My name is Sheila.
L:  My name is Karen, and I couldn't barely hear the phone when it rang, 'cause my --
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  -- husband is upstairs, he was --
R:  I dialed in, --
L:  Oh. 
R:  -- this is my first time of doing this.
L:  Oh, okay! Um, this is actually my third call, so, hopefully, uh, I'll get paid for this after [LAUGH] -- 'cause I think you're supposed to get three calls before you get paid.
R:  Right.  I just want to ask are you a member of Refunding Makes Sense.
L:  For who?
R:  Refunding Makes Sense?
L:  No.
R:  Oh, okay, that's how I found out about this, it was a online thing on the internet; --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but anyway --
L:  I found it on -- there's, like, a mystery shopping type --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- of thing.
R:  -- well, you're kind of in that genre then.
L:  Yeah, so the subject is about if there should be restrictions on reading materials in private --
R:  Public and private schools.
L:  -- and, well, I guess, I would have -- I would say, no.  I don't have kids, so I don't know, if this is -- you know, probably is as good a topic as I could, ah, --
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- have picked.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Do you have children?
R:  I do, I have two, um, and actually, they both go -- well, my son is going to be going to, um, kindergarten this fall, and my daughter is in sixth grade and, they do go to a Christian school, so --
L:  So then they do probably have, ah, limitations on certain types of --
R:  They do --
L:  Things.
R:  -- they do, um, they, you know, I mean, of course, you know, you -- they wouldn't be bringing in books -- um, you know, I gue- -- I don't know whether the question is kind of geared, maybe, even toward pornography, you know, like, if a child was to bring, maybe, let's say, maybe a bad magazine into, like, a public or --
L:  Oh, yeah, --
R:  -- or private school --
L:  -- but I mean, what I was thinking more when they were talking about different types of reading would be --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- more, you know, just, like, classic --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- types of stuff that maybe someone would not condone what was written in, you --
R:  Right.
L:  -- know, something from Shakespeare, or something, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but I do believe that there are certain age levels, that, you know, certain books are more appropriate for than others --
R:  Yeah.  I do too.  No, I, I, I, um, I -- I guess I have to -- would change my opinion, then, and say, y- -- I feel that way too.  I went to a public school, and I remember, we read, um, The Diary of Anne Frank, and I don't even remember what page it was, but, you know, there was, like, a -- kind of a scandalous scene where Anne had written, that she, I think, had kissed her girlfriend, you know, they were experimenting, they were young children, --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and I remember being, like, "Wow, you know, this is bad stuff!" [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and you know, I mentioned it to the teacher, and it became, um, you know, like, a big thing and, some of the parents were upset about it, but they did not pull the book, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but I just -- you know, I -- I had questions back then 'cause I think we read it in about sixth grade, or something like that, and, um, you know, I guess, you know, that was back in the mid eighties, I would suppose, and I guess --
L:  Right.  Well, would you --
R:  -- it was something more scandalous.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- would you think that's appropriate, though, like, if your kids, you know, your daughter's getting -- did you say she was in sixth grade?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, if --
R:  No, I -- I think I would have a problem if she took a book to school and, you know, a teacher said that that was not appropriate, I-I know I would have to question why.  And, of course, with it being a Christian school, thinking that they might try to throw out, you know, some sort of Biblical quote or something, but I would have to refute that by saying, you know, we have freedom of speech, freedom -- you know, that's -- that's -- churches are for that, freedom of religion, freedom, you know, freedom of the press, so, I would be against censoring a child on -- you know, on what they could read on that, because I think ultimately that is a parent's choice, to look at the book and determine whether it would be appropriate or not.
L:  Right.  I would agree with that, you know, it's, it's, like I said, kind of a tough subject for me, since, --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- like I said, I -- I don't have kids, but, you know, I guess I can still have an opinion on --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what's appropriate, and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know. So --
R:  Well, I know that they have, you know, done -- I've read articles in, you know, papers and stuff where even public schools, a parent will have a problem with a book, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I wish I could -- like you say, it's a hard subject to talk about, I can't remember a specific one -- like, Catcher in the Rye, I remember, was supposed to be sort of scandalous, --
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] --
R:  -- um, but, of course, tame by today's standards, you know?
L:  True, true, true.
R:  So, um, --
L:  That's --
R:  -- but, you know, I never personally experienced that in public or private school myself, --
L:  Yeah, --
R:  -- so, --
L:  -- I-I haven't either, I went, obviously too, a public school, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I know, I know some of my customers who are -- I wonder how this would pertain to home schooling?  I know some of my customers do a lot of home schooling, --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- if they would censor their own kids, -- [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I guess it doesn't count then.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I guess that would be okay because then they'd be the school and the parent, you know, --
L:  That's true!
R:  -- so that probably wouldn't be a problem.
L:  True.
R:  But, um, you know, even that -- at home, it's like, I would try to, you know, ask my child, you know, why, you know, if it was something I felt it was inappropriate, I'd still have -- you know, learning as a parent, as well, to say, you know, not just to stick your foot down and say I said no, because that just breeds, you know, resentment on their part, I- I'm trying to learn, to -- you know, listen to their feelings as well, as opposed to just mom knows best.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, so that's kind of, you know, along the parent censorship thing as well, you know, of trying to say, well, I respect your opinion and, you know, let's talk about why you want to do this or why you don't, --
L:  That's --
R:  -- but, ultimately, you know, the mom's the ruler.  [LAUGH] So --
L:  That's true, that's true, so -- is -- have you -- this is your first call?
R:  Yeah.
L:  For Fisher?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Sometimes -- it's -- one minute you think, "Oh, ten minutes is too long", and the next minute you think, "Oh, ten minutes is too short!"
R:  Yeah, my --
L:  'Cause it's [MN] --
R:  -- yeah, my mom did one the other day, she has a phone downstairs, and she said she enjoyed talking to the lady so much, and I don't remember their subject, but, I mean, she was, like, "Oh, I wish we could talk longer!" [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, -- but she's a talker, so -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, --
L:  With --
R:  -- man, I don't even know what else to say about the subject.
L:  I know! It's, like I said, because, I -- you know, it's kind of, like, we have a -- kind of a mutual, ah, agreement on it, so, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's not like we can, ah, say, "Ah, you're wrong", and --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  So -- where -- where are you calling from?
R:  I'm in Fredericksburg[?], Virginia.
L:  Virginia, you're --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- way across the country, I'm in California.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, in fact, ah, my husband went to Virginia Tech.  Isn't that in Fredericksburg?
R:  Yeah, it, well, it well, it's down, um, l- -- Blacksburg, and, ah, --
L:  -- Blacksburg, right.
R:  -- yeah.  Yeah.  
L:  That's funny.
R:  But they, um, the, the study thing, I kind of learned about it on the internet, from, --
L:  I did too.
R:  Oh, did you?
L:  But, but, like I said, through a shopping --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- type of website -- and you said you learned through, --
R:  It's a group called Refunding Makes Sense, --
L:  Refunding Makes Sense.
R:  -- and it's -- it -- wh- -- online, it's refund cents dot com.
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and there's, you know, ladies that post and, they're all about, mak-  -- you know, um, saving money, making money, you know, getting the last bit of money that you can out of your dollar.  And a lovely lady on there had posted the study, and the reason I ask you is so many people are calling that they're actually ending up talking to b- -- people on the board, you know, [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so, they're, like, "Oh, hi, how are you doing, I see your name all the time", so, --
L:  And I know there's quite a few shoppers that do that, too, so, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, like I said, when I first found out about it -- it's been a while, this is my third call and, --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- ah, I know, some people have gotten paid, you know, depending on how many calls they've done, so -- they were originally supposed to pay you after the third call.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- I don't know if we should be getting so sidetracked here.  But -- [LAUGH]
R:  Well, to the lovely pe- people at Fisher -- thank you! Yeah, I --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- [LAUGH] 'cause I guess they'll be listening, you know, at some point to our conversation, but --
L:  I would think so, but I think they're analyzing how -- basically, how two strangers talk, so, I mean, even though we're kind of veering off the --
R:  Yeah.  The subject -- [LAUGH]
L:  -- the subject at hand, we're still talking!
R:  Right, right.
L:  But, um, yeah, it's a good thing -- it's a fun thing, I think, I'm trying to think of some of the other subjects I've talked about, and, yeah. Like --
R:  I called in the other -- well, one thing I was not clear about was is it said they were going to call you -- or their phone lines are open between, I believe, it's one and two, or two and three, and I had put down, um, to please call me on Sundays, you know, about that time, but, I have, like, one of those call interrupt things on my phone for telemarketers, --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and I've never gotten a call, so, I think, the --evidently, the computer dials it --
L:  Yeah, -- I've gotten calls, --
R:  -- and then you know, they just give up.
L:  -- I've gotten calls, where, it's picked it up on the answering machine, and --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and, it's -- no one's been home.
R:  Right.
L:  They -- they haven't always called on the time frame that I said I would be around --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- so, but they've always -- I --
R:  Well, I called the other night, you know, I initi- -- I init- -- initiated a call on Friday night about seven thirty and it said, "We're looking for a person", and you know, it went on for about five minutes and, then I just thought, "Oh, maybe, maybe they're not really there right now, you know, maybe I do have to stick to that time".  So today I thought, "Well, I'll give it another shot", and when -- when you came on I was just, like, "Whoa! [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it's working!"
L:  That was quick, huh?
R:  Yeah, it was neat. It was neat.
L:  Well, they probab- -- I think it's all computer generated, so when they start calling people, you know, sometimes people are available and sometimes they're not.
R:  Right.  Right.  So -- so that was it.  
L:  Um, -- gosh, it seems like it's been ten minutes, --
R:  -- I know.  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I guess, should we talk more about the, uh, --
R:  Okay, w- we will state again that we are, we are against censorship! [LAUGH]
L:  Against censorship in both public and private schools, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you who have children, I who do not -- [LAUGH] and, ah, um, --
R:  Are you married?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay.
L:  Just -- just no children.
R:  Just no kids, well, -- 
L:  No.  Yeah.
R:  -- sometimes [LAUGH] -- there are times when my children are fighting, and I'm, like, thinking, "Why do I want these kids?"  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, there've been many times where, oh, you know -- but it's not, too, that we had -- didn't want any, we just haven't been able to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to have them, so, um, we have a dog and a cat instead.  [LAUGH]
R:  Hey, well, that's -- my brother and sister are like that.  Uh, she has, a, actually, a disease that makes her not want to have them because she might ha- -- you know, pass something on hereditarily --
L:  Oh, --
R:  So, she -- they have three lovely cats, and those are her children, so, you know, we still send her a Mother's Day card for the kiddies, and --
L:  How sweet!
R:  -- you know, she enjoys that, and -- and they're spoiled at Christmas time and that whole thing, so, that's kind of cool.
L:  Yeah, my pets are definitely spoiled.  I call them my fur babies.
R:  Yeah there you go! [LAUGH]
L:  -- fu- fur kids, so -- it's had to have been ten minutes, I've done these conversations before, and -- I didn't look --
R:  They're probably thinking, "Oh, let's, let's just let them hang on there and drag this censorship thing out".  [LAUGH]
L:  "T- -- They have to talk ten minutes on the subject at -- on hand, and they haven't done that, so" -- [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I think, well, you know, when it, when it just said, "Censorship", and then it -- then it came on, and then it said, the question of the day is, and it was a much more detailed question, you know, about, "Did you believe public or private schools should censor", and I thought, "Oh, well, I can talk to that", and then I'm thinking, "Well, you know, after you say, if you say you had been against it and I had been for it, it might have been easier to say, well, you know, you know, why do you feel that way?", or something, but, --
L:  True.
R:  -- but, unfortunately, I guess being both, you know, feeling
