R:  I missed the question.  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Oh, hi! Didn't hear your tone.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, -- nor did I!
R:  [LAUGH] I was waiting for the --
L:  Okay.  Yeah.  Hi, my name is Linda.
R:  [COUGH] Hi, I'm Janice, and I missed the question, too, my husband was talking to me.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [MN] Something about public and private schools?
L:  If they -- I think the question is [MN] whether they have the right to censor books.  
R:  Oh, well, I've been a public school teacher for thirty two years, -- [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  Do you have an -- do you have an opinion on it?
R:  Yeah, I think we should be able to, as long --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- as they're in the school system, I think we should be able to decide what books they can and cannot read, if they're talking about -- if they're talking about text books, or library books, as long as they're in the school system, I think the school should have the right to say if they can have them in their library or not.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I don't think we --
L:  Well, I'm, see --
R:  I don't think we have the right to say what they read at home, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but I think as long as it's within the school system, we should be able to say if they can or cannot read that book.  We have a few that aren't allowed in our library, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like Little Black Sambo -- did you ever read that book?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I think it's cute! I mean --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's just a --
L:  Mhm.
R:  A story, and they won't allow it in our library.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That, to me, that's silly.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But still, it's in our library, and if they choose not to have it there, then they choose not to have it there, I'm not going to make a great big noisy fuss about it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I just can't -- I just can't believe that they won't -- that's such a cute story! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and if you just look at it as just being a story, it is! --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- their put too much behind everything.
L:  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, --
R:  And I don't, I --
L:  -- and ho- -- and honestly, I haven't read it for so many years, but --
R:  Oh, me either --
L:  -- I, you know, I don't know, I mean, I mean, I think that --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- to me, censorship, from the same point, that we have people in this world who are adults, and -- and who are children, you know, and the school system, I mean, sets themselves out to be the adults, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so, it would seem that they have, I mean, to me -- some ability to, um, you know, to say what books will or will not be allowed, you know, I -- I do think that there needs to be a reason given, --
R:  Oh, yes, yes, well, like, which [inaudible] is textbooks, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they'll put parents on the committee, because they aren't the ones that teach it, parents -- the teachers pick out the textbooks, at -- well, we do at least in our school system, we pick out the textbooks that are going to be read, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- are used as textbooks in our school system, but parents aren't asked, because we basically look for them for content, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for the content area, and I think it depends upon --
L:  Are you by any ch- -- are you in Texas?
R:  No, I'm in Ohio.
L:  Oh, okay, you know, --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- 'cause, ah, Texas has, um, has what a lot of people consider a pretty repressive textbook selection process, so, that's why I was -- it's interesting.
R:  You mean, they're very, very particular about it, or?
L:  Oh, yes.  Yes, they're very particular, and, and we actually have some people on our textbook selection committee, and I just -- to me, this is the problem, where -- how extreme censorship can be -- [MN] people who prefer that creationism be taught.
R:  Oh, okay, yeah, I've, I've heard about -- yes, yes -- we don't have it.
L:  You know, rather than, you know, evolution which most of us just thought was part of scientific fact.
R:  Right, we don't have anything like that in our area at all --
L:  No, mhm.
R:  -- we're pretty liberal around here -- 
L:  Mhm, yeah --
R:  -- but I think it depends on what part of the country you are from, like, I probably believe -- in the southern states, they would probably pick out a different book, the way it taught about the Civil War --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- than what we would --
L:  Mm. Mhm.
R:  -- pick out in the North.  
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, I guess, that's --
R:  But -- but then still, facts are facts.
L:  Yeah.  Well, and those would be the, you know, I think, to me, the, you know, [LAUGH] -- to me, the issue with censorship is, like, yeah, yeah, I'm for it as long as I can do the censoring.
R:  Right, right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that's probably the -- for me, is -- is what, um, becomes a -- a difficulty, you know, as in terms of where you [SIGH] -- where you're [MN] trying to impose particular beliefs.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, that really shouldn't have anything to do with when you pick out a book.
L:  No.
R:  I don't think you should have any -- a teacher doesn't teach what he or she believes, he usually teaches what the textbook has in it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Sometimes you may express your beliefs, but it's best not to, in a classroom, --
L:  Mhm. Mhm.
R:  -- because you can get yourself in big trouble doing that, 
L:  Oh, sure, --
R:  -- there's a lot of parents that are very -- they really watch what a teacher does, and a lot of them look for you to do something wrong, --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- and jump right on the band wagon if you do, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so you have to be kind of careful; --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I taught third and fourth grade -- it's not quite as bad with the little kids.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But they still -- I mean, what you say to them is like God speaking to them, --
L:  Yeah, and, and that's --
R:  -- and if you say it, it is the truth, in their minds --
L:  -- which is -- is the other part, right, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because I think teachers have, you know, they have sometimes have a much larger influence on --
R:  Right.
L:  -- on children.  And -- and then, and, you know, I think likewise, school systems do, I mean, we're really more and more the, you know, in place of parents, you know, in loco parentis, so --
R:  Yeah, well, it's sad to say, but a lot of parents aren't parents any more, --
L:  Well, --
R:  -- it's -- it's changed a lot in the thirty two years that I taught, --
L:  I bet.
R:  -- I have a lot of parents that just aren't involved with the child's education at all, they --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- have -- well, they don't even know what the teacher's -- the child's teacher's name is.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They'll come in for a conference, or --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- they don't come for conferences, and they have --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- no idea.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm not saying all parents are like that, but more so now, than when --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I first began teaching.
L:  Yeah, --
R:  It's just --
L:  -- yeah, and you are still teaching? [MN]
R:  No.  I retired two years ago, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but I taught almost the whole year this year for a teacher who was -- had both her knees replaced.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I taught fourth grade. 
L:  [MN]
R:  And I taught fourth grade at the beginning of the year for a teacher who was taking radiation treatment, so then almost the whole end of year.  
L:  Mm.
R:  No, I retired two years ago.
L:  Okay.  Would you want to sit on a censorship committee, do you think?
R:  What did you mean, to pick out a book?
L:  I mean, or -- or a committee that did screen books for the library, or --
R:  Well, I wouldn't mind doing that, --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- but I -- I'm very liberal, I would --
L:  -- yeah.
R:  -- probably allow a lot of things a that or people wouldn't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- allow, because I figure I don't know what -- [LAUGH] I mean, I'm going to be a little -- a little hesitant about works with a lot of sex or a lot of bad words in it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that I wouldn't -- I wouldn't stand for, --
L:  Yeah. Yeah.
R:  -- that I would really go against, but, like, -- I don't know, just, like, Little Black Sambo, I go back to that one all the time, --
L:  I know.
R:  -- I just don't see any reason, it's -- I know what they're saying, and why they won't allow the book.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But children, when they read that book, it's just a fun book to read, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they don't put anything into it.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  But I think it's a lot of the black community has really put a stop to that book.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's why it's no longer allowed.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I guess, it's -- and some of my f- [MN] -- 'cause the other thought I have about censorship is, there are a lot of books I would really rather have children read when they have an adult they can discuss them with.
R:  Right, right. They --
L:  -- and so, that would be my other reason about being very careful to not --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- over censor.
R:  Yeah. We had a -- we had a parent that, um, one of the teachers was reading the Harry Potter --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- set to her children, --
L:  Why, that's a good excuse --
R:  -- and the mother just had a fit, -- 
L:  Yeah, it's witchcraft --
R:  -- and wouldn't allow the child in the classroom where the story was being read.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Child just threw a fit, they wanted to be there, they loved the story, they wanted to hear it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They were just listening to it as a story, they weren't putting in all the -- they're talking about, um, I'm trying -- witchcraft.  That type of thing is --
L:  -- witchcraft, that's right.
R:  -- what they're putting into it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And children don't look at it that way, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they just love the books.
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I've got third graders that would read that book and that's a hard book --
L:  Right, and they wouldn't read anything else.  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  -- to read for third grade.  Right, they wouldn't put it down, I mean, every time --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- their work is done, that book was in their hands, reading it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I think that's great, that they're reading like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Now, that kind of book I don't have a problem with.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But this teacher said, "Well, I'm not going to stop reading it to the entire class for one child --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, when I begin reading the story, you may just go to the library, Will".  He didn't want to go to the library, he wanted to hear the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- story, so he and his mother had a roundabout and he stayed and listened to the story! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  She allowed him to, but -- but the teacher said it was his decision.
L:  Well, --
R:  She wasn't going to say you have to leave, going to say you have to stay.  It's his decision, that way, the parents --
L:  Right, right, because it was --
R:  -- couldn't come back on her.
L:  -- between him and his parents, right.
R:  Right, but I was shocked when I found out that this parent did not want her child to listen to that story, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it really surprised me.
L:  Yeah, I have heard that, that there have been places, and, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and that there have been libraries that have banned it for that reason.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh-huh.  I still think they should have the option -- if you take it out of the library, the children aren't even given the option --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to read that book, I -- I think as --
L:  Right.
R:  -- parents, as long as they supervise, kids should have that option of whether they want to read it or not.
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there were also a, ah, Judy Blume book, can't think of the name of it right now, and she writes --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like, Ramona -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- no -- no, no, no, not Ramona, she writes, oh, shoot, I'm trying to think -- fourth -- she writes tales to fourth grade and up, thing, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I think she does, but anyway, she's got some really good stories --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and this one was about a girl --
L:  And she's won a lot of library book awards, and all that stuff, yeah --
R:  Right, but there's one of her books that's really been censored by a lot of libraries, and I don't know if it's about death, --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it seems like a child dies in it, I can't remember, --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- 'cause I didn't read the story, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but that one that was censored, and she's a wonderful author, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- writes some really good children's books.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Oh.
L:  And to me, that's -- I mean, I think that's the issue, is also, what are the -- you know, what are, what will the guidelines be?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, and then, you know, again, I think we need to weigh what -- you know, whether it would be better for children to tackle some of these topics --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with support from adults.
R:  Right.  And see it that way, rather than just --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, because th- there seems to be --
R:  -- read about it on their own, or just, not be exposed to it at all and then find out about it from or kids.
L:  Right.
R:  'Cause that's the worst way for them to find out.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because children -- they can change things so entirely.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, sure.
R:  They see things from a- an entirely different viewpoint than adults.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Do you have children?
L:  Oh, yes, --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- oh, yes, yes, I have, yeah, two stepsons, and a foster daughter, and then we have two grandchildren, so --
R:  Wow --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we have three boys --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so I've seen it from both sides of the picture, as they've --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- gone through school, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't think there were any books that -- well, they did bring, there was one book the kids brought home from school, that I -- and I cannot remember it but I just remember being absolutely floored that they were asked to read this book, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean, it was not -- it was not a book I would have ever picked out for my child to read when he was in high school.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And we, and we -- [SIGH] shoot,--
L:  Yeah, well, you know, but there was talk about, like,
R: -- what was it?  I can't remember what it even was, --
L:  -- Catcher in the Rye, and some of those books.
R:  -- it wasn't that but it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I know we talked about it, and I said, you know, this book's got lot of really bad words in it. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Mom, you know, I'm a little bit older now, I understand that you can still read the story and just not pay attention to the bad words.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I said yes, but you lose what the story is really saying if you take out those words.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yes, but the teach
