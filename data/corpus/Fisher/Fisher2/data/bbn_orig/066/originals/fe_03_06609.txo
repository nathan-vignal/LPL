L:  Hello.
R:  Judy.
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Oh.  Hi.  [LAUGH]
R:  Hi.  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm Callie.
R:  Hi, Callie, I'm Judy.
L:  Hi.  [LAUGH]
R:  So, we're supposed to talk about censorship in schools.
L:  Okay, I don't know, -- what are we supposed to talk about?  Just whether or not we think that books --
R:  [MN] They have the right to censor books?
L:  Mm! That's an interesting one I hadn't thought about.  [LAUGH]
R:  How old are you?
L:  I'm twenty five.  
R:  Twenty five?  I'm -- I'm thirty six, and, ah,  I can tell you that I don't -- I don't necessarily think that they do, I remember that they used to do that a lot whenever I was, ah, -- when I was in high school.  This would have been junior high school, about f- -- when I was aged about fourteen?  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And --
L:  -- they did censor for you or they didn't?
R:  They did, they used to try to, and, ah, and they actually had -- my, ah, my father actually had to sign a letter saying it was okay for me to read certain books.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, like, ah, Ulysses was one of them.  And --
L:  Wow, see, I was never -- I was never censored, and I went to two different -- I was in high school and junior high school in Miami, and then also [MN] here in Maryland and in both places we were never required to get permission or to sign anything.
R:  There wasn't, like, a list?
L:  Not that I recall, no.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, they had, like, a big old list where I was at, and there was, like, oh, there was all kinds of things on it, that would just, like, they would just, like, totally amaze you, things, like, um, like Huckleberry Finn, because it had the N word in it.
L:  Actually, you know, maybe, now that you mention it, now that you say Huckleberry Finn, now that that's coming back to me, I think maybe we did have to get permission for some.
R:  Yeah, 'cause it had, like, the N word in it, --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- and we were going to be horribly corrupted -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- if we saw that --
L:  If we heard or read that!
R:  Yeah, 'cause we'd never heard that word before.
L:  Of course not.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's funny.
R:  And, ah, --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Gosh, I'm trying to think, then, like I said, Ulysses, by James Joyce --
L:  Mhm.  Well, do you have kids now?
R:  No, I don't.
L:  Okay, neither do I.
R:  But I would let them, I mean, you know -- [MN]
L:  Would you let them read anything, or do you think that there are certain things they shouldn't read?
R:  No, I would -- I would let 'em read anything -- oh, you know what else was on there?  A Clockwork Orange was on there.
L:  A Clockwork Orange was on it, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Huh!
R:  A Clockwork Orange, and, you know, I mean, my father was, like, --
L:  That's definitely an interesting movie! [LAUGH]
R:  -- yeah, [LAUGH] well, my father was, like, "Read -- read whatever you want.  I mean, what's going to happen?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You're an intelligent individual, it's not like it's going to seep in and rot your brain, you're responsible for what you do".
L:  -- I mean, I think if they're offering, you know, those type of books to certain levels of children, you know, in certain grades, they -- obviously they feel, at least, you know, the majority of kids can handle it, or else they wouldn't, you know, put it for that grade.
R:  Yeah, well that's what -- that's what you would think, it's like, I think, pretty much, censorship, I don't know how you lean politically, but it seems like a real liberal thing, that you're not intelligent enough to, ah, you know, --
L:  Process, and digest things?
R:  -- to, yeah, to understand what you read, and so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you have to be protected from it --
L:  Yeah, some children --
R:  -- by the -- by the Government.
L:  -- are smarter than adults.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, in certain ways.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, and we don't censor adults. [LAUGH]
R:  No, [LAUGH] or, or, actually, yeah, yeah, sometimes we do.
L:  Well, yeah, sometimes, but --
R:  -- and then, people get all upset, kind of runs, like, I think that if you try and tell people what they can and can't read and say, when --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they're in the public schools that, um, eventually those are the people that go out and, ah, and, like, lay out on bridges in San Francisco, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because they don't know how to appropriately express themselves.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm, exactly.  But also, I would think if you're telling a student, you know, or a kid, you know, hey, you're not allowed to read this book, wouldn't that make them want to read it more?
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  Perhaps, or if, like, say, you know, you have to get the permission from the parents, um, you know, if all your friends are allowed to read it and for whatever reason your parent is saying no, I don't feel it's appropriate for you, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you may, you know, then still go ahead and read it on your own anyway because why don't you get to read it?  [LAUGH]
R:  Right, and I don't think any knowledge is necessarily bad, in fact, I remember, the thing with Ulysses, um, my, ah,  my English teacher had it on her desk, and I was kind of flipping through it, and she took it away from me, she said, "No, you can't read that", --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I took it back, and said, "Well, I think I can", --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and she took it back and said, "No, I -- I don't think that you would understand it", --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and so I took it back away from her and said, "Well, I think I would, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and you have the note that says I can read whatever I want to", --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so I went back to my desk with the book, and opened it up to the first page and there was a little post it note in there that said, "Gotcha! love, Miss Raschke".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's funny.
R:  But that's exactly what you were saying, I probably would never have wanted to even look at it if she hadn't said, "No, you can't read that".
L:  Exactly.
R:  It's, like, "The hell I can't! --
L:  Well, why can't I?
R:  -- [LAUGH] hand that over! I'll read whatever I want to read!"
L:  Exactly.
R:  And, and, gosh, it's --
L:  Well, maybe that's a good way, then, to get kids to read.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah no kidding, but you --
L:  You know, tell them they're not allowed to read! [LAUGH]
R:  But, you know, a book that's on the list now is Harry Potter.
L:  Really?
R:  Well, yeah.
L:  Huh, I guess, well, I've read all four of them, um, and I guess I could see, depending on, you know, what the age group it is, you know, I could see it being inappropriate for, you know, younger kids, because it might be, kinda, I guess, scarier, whatever, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, --
R:  Yeah. But --
L:  -- as far as, like, high school kids and stuff, I don't see why they shouldn't be allowed to read it.
R:  Well, because they might turn into Satan worshippers.
L:  Ah, yes --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that's true, they may want to fly around on the broo- -- broomsticks.
R:  More power to 'em, I -- I think they tried that up here, actually, I'm in New Hampshire.
L:  Okay.
R:  And I think they tried that -- that whole broom stick thing and burned a bunch of 'em.
L:  Oh, gosh.
R:  Just to the south of me, right?
L:  Interesting.  
R:  In the -- in the sixteen hundreds.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and hung a bunch of 'em, and stuff, as I recall.  I'm not --
L:  I'm really surprised, though, that that's -- I wouldn't have thought that that would be on there.  But, yeah, I guess -- huh.
R:  Yep, I'm not, I'm not from New Hampshire, I mean, I'm from Texas, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so I'm not that familiar with it, but I think that Salem was right around here somewhere.
L:  I think so, yeah, somewhere around, maybe in Massachusetts, New Hampshire area.
R:  Now, of course, in New Hampshire, I doubt that they do much censorship, just because it's New Hampshire, and they're, you know, live free or die.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But I wouldn't know about -- I would think, maybe, in, uh, are you in, are you, ah, near Washington --
L:  I'm in Maryland.  Mhm, I'm right out of DC.
R:  Yeah, I would suspect that there's a lot more problem with the political -- political correctness around there.
L:  Yeah, like I said, you know, I don't really know much about it, now, 'cause, like, I don't have any kids or anything, [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, I mean, you know, they try to censor you for a lot of things, [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but then, at the same time, because you are right by DC, you know, you have that quote right, you know, to do what you want.
R:  Yeah, yeah, I would, I would think, you know, the best way to find out, probably, if they're doing that would be, like, to listen to talk radio, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, uh, the local talk show hosts, not, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, not like Rush, but, like, the people who are on --
L:  Yeah, the local, --
R:  -- yeah, --
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- they would probably -- they probably would know, they'd -- they'll be screaming about it if they are, --
L:  Yeah.  Probably.
R:  -- that's the kind of thing that irritates a conservative talk show host no end.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That is true.  Very true.  Yeah, I don't know much -- much about it, though, for this area, oddly enough, even though I'm here.  [LAUGH]
R:  How long have you lived there?
L:  Because I -- what'd you say?
R:  How long have you lived there?
L:  Um, just a few years, --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- but, um, yeah, I mean, but, you know given that I can read whatever book I want, [LAUGH] --
R:  Well, yeah --
L:  -- I don't follow it very closely.
R:  And if you had kids, though, would you, I mean, --
L:  I don't think I would censor them -- I mean, I would think I would sign, you know, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- pretty much anything, 'cause I don't -- I mean, I don't see why, you know, it's --
R:  Kids --
L:  -- part of our history in terms of, you know, everybody's read 'em:
R:  Yeah, well, if a kid comes home with, like, A Clockwork Orange you're not going to freak out, right?
L:  I'd be, like, want to watch the movie?
R:  Yeah, you might want to, yeah, you might want to be with 'em, depending on their age.
L:  Yeah, --
R:  'Cause it might be confusing.
L:  I seriously had no idea that was a book, though, until you mentioned it.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's, uh, Burrows.
L:  Okay.
R:  Check it out, it's a lot scarier than the movie.  That whole thing where they they hold your eyes open --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and make you watch, ah, and make you watch violent movies to Beethoven, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's explained, that's, that's, that's negative conditioning.
L:  Ah.
R:  -- and it's -- and it's explained in great detail in the --
L:  -- in the book [LAUGH]
R:  -- in the book.  Yeah, it's, it's, ah, he's actually been -- been like that, for, for days and days.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- with his eyes open that way, with the Beethoven playing constantly.
L:  That's fun! [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it's a, it's a, it's a strange book.
L:  Yeah, I couldn't, [MN] I wouldn't have a problem, though, if my children came home, you know, with, whatever type of permission form to, you know, to read it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's the same as saying, you know, well, I guess, the same with, like, field trips, to say, for s- -- for example, this area, like, some of the museums, you know, should you not let your kids go to certain museums because it could --
R:  Yeah, it could be very upsetting, but, at the same time that stuff happens, you can't pretend like it doesn't.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, I would think probably, you know, like, if, if they were going to read Huckleberry Finn or something, you know, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I might tell 'em, now, there's some words in here that we don't say.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  See this one right here?  We don't say that.  [LAUGH]
L:  But, you know, that -- that's how they talked back then.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  You know, so it is part of, it is part of the history.
R:  Well, yeah, I mean, I would think that, but I wouldn't say -- I don't think the public school system needs to -- needs to tell anybody's children what they can and can't say and read and think.
L:  Yeah, no, definitely.
R:  What they're afraid of ultimately, I guess, is that they'll be thinking.
L:  That is true.
R:  You don't want 'em thinking.  I guess they were -- they were worried about that at Columbine, too, that maybe because Mein Kampf was available in the school library, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that, um, are -- are you familiar with that book, --
L:  Yes. Mhm.
R:  -- that, ah, maybe that was the reason why, because I guess Mein Kampf actually, ah, -- I've never read it, because I didn't -- I've never had any desire to read it, but I guess that it --
L:  I haven't read it but I know all about -- [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I guess it -- it, um, encourages the kind of things that
