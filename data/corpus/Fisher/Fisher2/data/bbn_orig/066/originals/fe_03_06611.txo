L:  Hello.
R:  Hello. 
L:  This is Tammy. 
R:  Oh, hi, this is Anna. 
L:  Um, well --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I never really thought about public schools before --
R:  No?
L:  -- I mean, like private school and censorship. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Have you?
R:  Ah, well, I -- I went to a public school. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, no -- no, I think it was private -- it was a question about --
R:  Oh, was it?
L:  -- private or public?
R:  Oh, was it, oh?  Censorship and private school.
L:  Yeah.  I went to a public school.  I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so I don't know.  I would think, yeah, that there should be to a certain point of a censorsh- -- of a censorship. 
R:  Yeah, I don't -- yeah, it's a hard question.  I don't even exactly know --
L:  Right.  'Cause they kinda didn't --
R:  -- what they mean.
L:  -- give you too much to go with on that.  
R:  No --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- not really. [LAUGH]  Um, [LIPSMACK] I guess probably, oh, I know what they -- they said, about -- they're talking about reading certain kinds books --
L:  Right.  And how --
R:  Oh, right should they be censored on what kind of books they can read?  Yeah, well,  I -- I don't think so, really. 
L:  [MN]
R:  I mean, I get and they should have said also what grade they're talking about.  
L:  Right. 
R:  You know, if it's little kids it might be, you know, different, you know, 'cause maybe certain books for younger kids should be, um, dealt with by the family, maybe, you know. 
L:  Right.
R:  But if it's older kids, you know, like high school and ov- over, I think the [several inaudible words] --
L:  Well, how they remove certain books from the library in the schools --
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- saying, I think, like, Tom Sawyer was one of 'em that they removed.
R:  Oh, right. 
L:  So, something like that, no, I don't think they should, because --
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  -- that's just --
R:  -- I agree. 
L:  -- part of [PAUSE] I don't know, the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- written word that's been out --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and --
R:  Well, I think it's important, yeah, for, you know, for them to get all the information they can and I think Tom Sawyer was a classic.  
L:  Yeah. 
R:  So, it seems like that would be good information for people to read.
L:  Right. 
R:  I mean, I don't -- I don't know, I never read exactly why they censored that.
L:  Certain words they refrained 'cause they --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- used referring to people and things --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- where that's were -- that's what they used -- terminology kinda like with Shakespeare --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's the way they spoke. 
R:  Right.
L:  That's the way it was written. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And this -- this day and age if that book was to be written, it wouldn't be written that way, because we don't speak with thee and thou.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, it just depends on what times --
R:  Right.  And I think that, you know, the m- more freedom we can have the better, 'cause I think a lot of our freedoms are being taken away from us.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I don't think that's a good thing.  'Cause, you know, it sort of makes you feel like they don't value your -- your, um, own --  you know, your own opinion about what -- what should be studied and what should be read and I think --
L:  I -- now see too now -- too though in school, is they can do whatever they would want to teach and now what if it's not with your beliefs and you --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- don't want your kid to learn that way --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- or from that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- book, that certain religions have certain thoughts too, and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so then -- then maybe they should have, ah, different [NOISE] different book or something that those people could read, that's -- there's only --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- there's so many limits and how do you handle --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that then?
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ...
R:  I think -- I think, maybe, you know, instead of saying they should censor stuff, they should, you know, just have, you know, a number of choices --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that people could make, instead of --
L:  So [inaudible] --
R:  -- saying, "Yeah, you have to either do it this way or that way".  They can, you know, give you several choices of what you can read for whatever purpose it -- you're reading it. 
L:  Right --
R:  You know.
L:  -- but they'd have different examples of --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the same thing, but different. 
R:  Right, instead of saying --
L:  Maybe --
R:  -- right, instead of saying is better than the other one --
L:  Right, this is your choice, you do it on --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- this, this or this. 
R:  Yeah.  Right, 'cause then, you know, if you have your own belief system that you can go by --
L:  Right.
R:  -- instead of somebody telling you how you -- they want you to believe.  Yeah ...
L:  Right, and actually too for your own learning ability --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- where I don't think I could read Shakespeare and totally understand it either. [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I mean now --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I'm older [LAUGH] 
R:  Right, mhm.
L:  -- so I mean, that way, I don't think I would ever of gotten anything out of Shakespeare if I had to read something like that. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  So with the censorship, that wasn't even a thought back when I was going to school.  
R:  Mhm.  And I guess too, maybe, I mean, speaking of Shakespeare, probably would probably be easier to read it now.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean as an adult, because even the language would be sort of hard to understand.  It might just be fun to read it, you know, just to see what it was like. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.  Sort of. [LAUGH] So, where do you live? 
L:  Wisconsin.
R:  Oh, Wisconsin, wow. 
L:  Where do you live?
R:  I'm in Florida. 
L:  Oh.  
R:  We're pretty far -- pretty far away from each other.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I've  already done these studies and nobody is at the other end to answer, they couldn't find anybody and said, "Sorry". [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.  Yeah, I -- they tell me they were supposed to call me on Friday and nobody did.  But she did call me today. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And she gave me the number to call, so ...
L:  Oh.
R:  This is my second one. 
L:  How did you find out about doing this?
R:  Um, there's a -- a center for independent living --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- in the town I live in, and they send a newsletter around every month --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and so this -- this information was in that newsletter. 
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  So [inaudible] --
L:  It's getting around different ways then 'cause --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I heard about it on the internet. 
R:  Oh, you did?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  Well, actually I used to live in Philadelphia too.  Right near where the University of Pennsylvania is.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]  Did you do it back then?
R:  No, I didn't.  I didn't know --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- about it then. 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  But ... the linguistic data consortium. 
L:  Oh, hope --
R:  So guess it's valuable to do this, you know.
L:  Yeah, hopefully they're learning something.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  This kind of, um, telephone system is better for -- you know, hearing things more clear I guess. 
L:  Yeah.  So that's what this is for, it's for phone --
R:  Seems like -- well, I don't know, I mean, I can't understand exactly, it says [PAUSE] I don't know, linguistic data.
L:  Yeah.  And how different people in different parts of the country speak, maybe?
R:  Oh, I don't know.
L:  I don't know. 
R:  It just said -- it says it will support linguistic research, technology, development --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and education.  
L:  Oh.  Okay.
R:  And so ...
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Scientific research.  
L:  Mm.
R:  And then did they tell you to, like, put your name in a hat and somebody wins a thousand dollars?
L:  [NOISE] No, I'd --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- heard that after you do three --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- phone calls, you get, I think, ten dollars -- a ten dollar check sent out to you. 
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  And you also get out into a hat too?
R:  Yeah, well it says --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- by me chatting on the phone to support scientific research --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I may have the chance --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- to win a thousand dollars.
L:  Oh, that would be cool.
R:  [COUGH] Really.
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  I'm sure we could use a thousand dollars for --
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  [MN] [COUGH] 
L:  Got a few things I could do with that. 
R:  Yeah.  Really.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
R:  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, what else do we say about --
L:  [NOISE] Mm ...
R:  -- censorship, um --
L:  [LAUGH] Don't know. 
R:  Well, um, I think only under some circumstances would it be good.  But not --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- unless, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- everybody agreed to the circumstances.
L:  [NOISE] [MN] [NOISE] Well, they could even do, like, get something together and have, like, a survey and see in the different areas what they think --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- what the, you know, [MN] the schools and leave it up to the parents in that area --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- instead of being, like, a national [NOISE] type something, or ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  And let the P.T.A. take care of it. 
R:  Yeah, right. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I think that's -- that's a good point --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that local, you know, local groups should be involved in the education process --
L:  And to decide what --
R:  -- rather, like you said, rather than just, you know, the national --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- making all the rules.  It should be more local.
L:  'Cause that way it's easier I think to --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- to confine it to your area to what your [NOISE] child will learn. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause in certain areas, there's different religions or different ethnic compa- -- groups or --
R:  [COUGH] Right. 
L:  -- just different -- just different. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
