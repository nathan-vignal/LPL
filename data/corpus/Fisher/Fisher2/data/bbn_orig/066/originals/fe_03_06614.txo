R:  Hello!
L:  Hi!
R:  Hi, this is Deborah, I'm in Virginia.
L:  I'm Marisa, I'm in New York.
R:  Hi, Marisa, how are you tonight?
L:  I'm okay, a little upset with the weather, but, I'm relaxing, --
R:  I saw it was raining on the Today Show this morning, and I thought, "Oh, it's a rainy day in New York".  Well, we've got sunshine here.
L:  You do?  Oh, that's wonderful, you're --
R:  Yeah, it's about seventy five, it's really nice, for a change, --
L:  Oh, my goodness, oh, we've had the worst weekend, the whole weekend has just been raining and really gross.
R:  Oh, no!
L:  Yeah, but --
R:  Well, I guess we're supp- -- we're supposed to talk about the topic, --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- which was, um, do schools have the right to censor books.  Well, if it's --
L:  -- well, it guess it depends on whether it's public or private, but I don't think anyone should have censorship in general, like, in -- in life, over reading books; like, I think, maybe, a -- you know, I think maybe a school, like, um, um, a private school can say, you know, I -- I'm not sure that this is the type of, you know, reading that we should be allowing our s- -- or telling our students to or to not read, but, in terms of bringing literature into the school, or having students pick literature outside of the school, I don't think that they have the right to tell their students what to, or not, read.
R:  Well, you know, [MN] I went to private school and, it's -- it's kind of a black and white issue, and -- and we didn't have a problem with censorship, generally, if it was the classics, you know, there are -- there are a lot of schools that want to ban Tom Sawyer, because it's got, um, racial terms in it, that -- that were used in the eighteen hundreds that are no longer, and, you know, that people are offended, rightly so, by 'em, but, you know, we didn't have problems with that sort of thing, um, being in private school.  But it's, like, you know, if there's a-a really tawdry book, that's, you know, borders on porn, then I think, well, you know, yeah, they -- they have the right to censor that kind of thing, I don't think that's appropriate in school, I don't know that, you know, [MN] -- a public library would probably be different, but, as far as schools go, I think, you know, grades one through twelve, mm, probably not appropriate and, I -- I would support that kind of censorship.
L:  So, you think -- so you think, like, sexual, like, sexual censorship is okay, but, like, racial censorship isn't, like, I'm just -- like, where do you draw the line?  You know what I mean?
R:  Well, you know, when y- you look at Tom Sawyer, and it's considered a classic, it's Mark Twain, and generally schools will discuss, you know, why that's -- was acceptable at that time but no longer is, and I think most kids are brought up to know that that's not acceptable, but that it's taken in th- the time that it was.  No, I don't, I don't think Tom Sawyer should be, you know, for instance, um, censored.  But if it's something that, -- ah, a lot of communities have what they call, -- what is it, like community morals, or something like that, it's -- it's based on the morals of the community, as to whether something is acceptable or not, but, um, you know, like, if it was -- if they, if they had CD's of the Dixie Chicks, and they didn't like what they said about President Bush and said, "Well, we're yanking 'em out of the library", then yeah, I think that's wrong censorship.  It doesn't have to be porn, it could be for whatever reason.
L:  Right.  Well, like, there's a book, um, I forget the name of the book, like, Animal -- Animal Hou- -- what is it, Animal, Animal Something, where they ha- --
R:  Ah, Animal Farm?
L:  -- Animal Farm, where they have, like, um, like, I know some schools wanted to censor that, because there's a scene where, um, there -- there's, like, a pig that gets raped, or something, and it's -- it's similar to a rape scene and it can be offensive to certain children, what would you think about that?  Would you think that that would be, because it's a classic, it's okay, or because it deals with, like, sexual content, it should sort of be, like, discussed?
R:  Um, if it's -- I haven't read it, but I think -- [MN] I think the book you're talking about is Animal Forum -- Animal Farm by George Orwell, who --
L:  Yeah, that's what I'm -- yeah.
R:  -- yeah, ve- -- very provocative writer, um, -- I would support that being discussed in a classroom for, maybe high school students, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but for middle school students no, um, but if it's -- if it's discussed with a, you know, the teacher, and it's prescribed reading, like, you read this chapter, this night and this chapter the next night and discuss it in class, I would tend to accept it.  Um, again, it -- it depends -- it's -- it's not a real black and white issue if for me.  I -- I generally -- I used to be a reporter, so I don't support censorship, --
L:  Right, --
R:  -- but I can see where, you know, there, there are going to be parents, and -- and -- I'm not a parent, I don't have kids, but I would think, well, you know, I don't think I'd want my child reading Phillip Roth, if they were, like, twelve years old or younger.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Now, he -- he tends to write, you know, bordering on -- bordering on porn, it's, ah,  very explicit and, I remember going to the public library when I was a kid, and thinking, "Well, I'm going to check out a Phillip Roth book", and I did, and it was -- it was terrible! But it had a lot of sex in it, but it was just horrible, and I not, mm, "Well, [LAUGH] enough of that!"
L:  But don't you think, like, sometimes, like, I think, especially kids in this, like, day and age, like, a lot of them in high school are very into experimentation, into sexual acts, and maybe if there was a forum in which to discuss some of these books, if they chose to take the class, like, I know, um, in college, I had -- there was a class called Sex and Sexuality, where it did discuss such, you know, books that dealt with almost porn like topics, and you know, kids were able to go and discuss what they felt was appropriate and what not, and what it really meant, and how that might affect society and, I think a lot of kids in high school have a lot of, you know, pent up feelings, and nowhere to really discuss it, and maybe if there was a forum to do so, and maybe it should be in a health -- you know, a health classroom, or, something of that nature, but, maybe it shouldn't be done at all, you know, 'cause if it's not --
R:  Well, I think that's -- I think that's where parents are falling really short, that they don't sit their kids down, and as uncomfortable as either one might be, but, they really need to sit down and say, look, we want to know what you're thinking and, you may not want to tell us, but this is the only way that you're going to get through life.  And as far as discussing that sort of thing in classroom, you even said yourself that it was a college course, so, you were over eighteen.
L:  Right.
R:  So, you know, that's -- we're not talking about, you know, ten, twelve, thirteen year olds being exposed to something -- [MN] again, it depends on the content. 
L:  But I think, --
R:  There's trash out there, --
L:  -- it's definitely, --
R:  -- and it's on the internet too, yeah.
L:  -- exactly, like, on TV, I think a lot of children run away from, you know, reading, today, and they s in front of the TV set, and as much as they, you know, they can put labels on, you know, like, they can put labels on TV shows, like, you know, you shouldn't watch this unless you're seventeen,  like, I don't -- I don't know too many parents who censor their children from watching whatever is on TV, and most of the people I --
R:  Yeah, that's a joke.
L:  -- most of the people that I know have cable TV, you know what I mean, --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and they can, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they can really see whatever they want, and I -- I can remember being in high school, and having some of my, you know, male friends being, like, "Oh, you know, my father has Playboy, so, let's all go over there, and let's all go watch it", you know, and it became a joke, it became, you know, it sort of took away from the sensuality of sexuality, you know, and I think, I --
R:  Oh, absolutely, --
L:  -- and I think that if, you know, maybe, you know, they definitely should censor things in schools, but I think a lot of schools also stray from the topic so far, and try and stay so far away from certain things, that it almost becomes taboo to these children that are trying to revolt against their parents, to begin with, you know?
R:  Well, you know, it's, like, I -- I -- I'm in the South, and there's a-a lot of Southern Baptists who think, you know, -- and I'm not one of them, but I feel very comfortable in labeling them, because they're so easy to do that to, and they don't want sex ed in school, but they want to outlaw abortions too; and it's like, well, if you've got a stupid kid fooling around, what are you going to do, ruin their life?
L:  Right.
R:  So, you know, th- there's -- there's a lot of mixed messages down here that it's like, I cannot believe what century we're in, --
L:  Right, --
R:  -- and, you know, --
L:  -- I've never been to the South, I really -- I don't even know anyone from the South, like, I --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- but I can imagine it could be very different.  I mean, I live in New York, so it's, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, everything goes here.  [LAUGH] you know what I mean?  [LAUGH] but, I mean, did you, did you go to college as well in the South?
R:  Um,  I went to school in Richmond, Virginia, which is about, ah, I'm in Norfolk, which is -- it's been in the news a lot, because there's so much navy here, um, but, I've gone to New York a lot, I used to date a guy who was from Brooklyn, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when I was in school, and I -- I love New York.  In -- in Virginia, though, as far as politics goes, a Virginia Republican, -- or, a Virginia Democrat is kind of, like, a New York Republican, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, e- even, even our -- our more liberal politicians would be considered so conservative elsewhere.  It's just -- and we've -- and we've got Republicans ruling us, which I can't stand, because they're just so closed off, and where I'm at is the home of Pat Robertson, and, you know, Jerry Falwell is three hours away, and it just casts a pall over everything, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and you -- you -- there's just a whole lot of people that you just can't deal with.
L:  Do they have opinions on this, is -- is this a pretty strong, you know, topic, --
R:  Oh, well, yeah --
L:  -- of conversation amongst, I guess, parents, or what not, in -- in Virginia, or, like, in the South --
R:  Well, a lot of -- a lot of Virginians are like sheep following Pat Robertson, and Jerry Falwell, and -- and the Republican Party in Virginia, and, um, they -- they just don't go in for anything that would, um, increase the, the -- you know, the health education of kids in school, but yet, they're very, you know, anti abortion and anti, um, education, for
