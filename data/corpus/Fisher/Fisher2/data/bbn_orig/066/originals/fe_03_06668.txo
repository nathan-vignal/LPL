L:  Jay.
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, I'm Jay.
R:  Hi, I'm Gina.
L:  And I'm in [MN] Connecticut.  
R:  Oh, my boyfriend goes to school in Connecticut, in New Haven.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  Yeah, where are you?
L:  Deerfield.
R:  Okay.  Is that close to New Haven?
L:  Yeah.  It's half an hour.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm in, um, Minneapolis.
L:  Oh, boy.
R:  But I'm -- I live in Alabama actually, so --
L:  Oh, there you go.  
R:  Okay.  So do you exercise regularly?
L:  No.  
R:  Okay.  No, me neither.  [LAUGH].
L:  Not at all.
R:  Well, I want to.
L:  Me, too.  But when is there time?
R:  Oh, true.  
L:  Yeah.  I mean --
R:  Well, I -- I don't really find anything that I like.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, I -- I think if I found it, you know, it's -- you know, exercise in this day and age could well be most anything.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, just walking, whatever, and now --
R:  [COUGH].
L:  -- I could -- you know, the weather's conducive to it now, but I just don't have the time.  I mean, I have uh, you know, teenagers and -- and uh, I jus got home and do -- you know, now the phone rings --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- and uh, you know, the dog's gotta go out and --
R:  Right.  Well, you can walk your dog, or you can play, um, -- you could play football or something with your kids.
L:  Yeah.  Well, you know, my kids are at the age they don't want to do anything with me.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  You know?  But by the time -- you know, the wife's not home yet, so maybe throw something in the oven and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and just the usual every day activities.  You know?  It's just constant, it seems, and --
R:  Right.  Well, maybe -- 
L:  -- you know, over the years, joining a gym and all that, but it -- you know, you end up paying per month and you don't -- by the time you figure out how much you used it and whatever, it's not worth it.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, you really have to uh, like, you really have to like be dedicated to it, to exercise.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, and it's got --
R:  I -- I do a lot of yoga.  But that does that count as exercise?
L:  Yeah, I'm sure that's uh, you know, exercising the mind is just --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- as important as exercising the body.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Uh, you're right, you know, and then the same thing, part of exercising and everything goes with dieting and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, the same thing, you work so hard at it, you might be good for a week or ten days and all of a sudden you're out one night and you blow the whole ten days in uh --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- going out one time and uh I don't know, just -- yes, they keep telling you that you live longer and every study comes out that any kind of exercise is better than nothing, but --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it's just the -- I think you're -- like you said, if I could find something I enjoyed, uh, that you know, transferred into also exercising, but I don't know if it's out there.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  You know?
R:  Well, do you feel good, though?
L:  Do I feel good?
R:  Yeah?
L:  Well, I know I need to exercise, uh, I could --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- always -- everybody -- you know, you could always lose five, ten pounds.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, you know, yeah, it's out there, but uh in the back of your mind always, but you know, like you said, you know, the -- yeah, you could walk the dog and then you get three days of rain, so you don't walk and then --
R:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  -- the fourth day comes and you don't feel like it, so before you know it, the whole week has passed and --
R:  Right.
L:  Uh, you know, I've always ent- thought of getting a treadmill and uh you know, but just with my past history I know I wouldn't stick with it.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, and why couldn't you watch the news and just do the treadmill for half an hour every day?  But you know, I just -- yeah, I think as you get older, I'm in my forties -- hi, guys -- you just -- I don't know, I get to the point and say, "Oh, to hell with it".
R:  Right.  
L:  You know, but yeah, you know, the -- like you said, I think there's different -- and I never thought of it that way, but there's different exercises and probably exercising your mind is -- is just as good as your body. 
R:  Mm.
L:  Doing yoga and all that.  And uh, watching what you eat and uh you know, eating healthier is uh -- I'm sure some form of -- they would consider to have some form of exercise.
R:  Yeah.  Do you watch what you eat?
L:  Ah, yeah, again I do try to and everything, but then, you know, and all, but you know, you go to a graduation party --
R:  [LAUGH] yeah.
L:  -- you go -- you go to uh, a christening or --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, now that the summer's here, it's uh barbecues and this and that and then, you know, you watch what you eat, you eat healthy, eat healthy and then, bam, you're --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, that cake was delicious so you have another piece or --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  You know, whatever, you know, you -- you -- you know, they all -- you see what I say you should have, you know, six french fries.  I'm not gonna sit down and count out six french fries and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know?  Ah, sometimes it gets to me more -- not what it's all cracked up to be.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I know it's important and uh, and that, but I don't know.  But if they -- I wish they'd come out with a [inaudible].  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  They come out with something that's easy, you know, but I don't think it is.  It -- it's -- half of it's the effort and if you don't put the effort into it, like everything else -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you only get back what you put into it.  
R:  Mm.
L:  So I think I'm gonna stay somewhat unhealthy.
R:  Yeah, well that's okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean [LAUGH] well, I mean, you still have a while.
L:  Yeah.  You can always start and uh --
R:  Yeah.  Well, like my parents didn't start until, like their fifties.  
L:  And I was just gonna say --
R:  Um --
L:  -- are they like, uh, you know, when you get older, they -- the mall people or anything like that?  You know, the -- you go to the mall and see these people in the morning who just walk the mall every day?  
R:  Right.  Yeah, actually, I have seen them.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  And they just walk and you know, I -- I see that.  You know, it's great that they're getting out and they're doing something, but ho- you know, how many times can you look at the same mannequins every --
R:  Right.
L:  -- morning and the same sales signs and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, then you see a bunch of ten of them all stopping for coffee afterwards and sitting there --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and -- I don't know, I just think if I get to that age, I got to be able to find something better to do than walk the mall.
R:  Right.  [LAUGH].  
L:  You know?  
R:  Mm.  How old are your kids?
L:  You know, I've played with the idea of golf, and never took it up, but you know, that's walking and that's supposed to be, you know, great exercise and --
R:  Mm.  Maybe you get enough exercise, like, just doing your regular activities.  'Cause it sounds like you're pretty busy?
L:  Yeah, and oh, just life --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in general, you know, of constantly going and in and out of the car and who needs a ride and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm not complaining, but it's --
R:  How old are your kids?
L:  Oh, I got two that -- one's graduated, one just graduate -- and I got --
R:  From high school?
L:  -- uh, an eighteen year old that's trying to find himself and I got a --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- ah, a sixteen year old.
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  Yeah.  But I mean, they're all driving on their own now, but still --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, it's uh, you know, "Dad can you do this for me?" and you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- while you're out and about and uh, by the time you get -- like I said, by the time you get home at five or six, you know, I go to bed at nineish every night so by the time you read the paper and uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- deal with whatever issues, you know, mow the lawn or whatever --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- you know, you don't feel like -- you know, I -- I -- have you ever joined a gym?
R:  Um, no.  well, I go to -- I'm still in school and my dorm is, like, far from campus but really close to our gym or whatever.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I never go.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  All of my friends go.  I never go.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I go for yoga.  That's it.  
L:  And your age, you go in fa- fads, you -- you go strong for a while, then you drop off and --
R:  Mm.
L:  You -- are you that way?
R:  Um, no.  I just don't like to go.  Well, I mean, 'cause like I've tried, like, racquet ball and like softball [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  And um, like weightlifting, some -- I don't know.  Yeah, I -- I -- I usually try it like one day and then I'm like, no, no more.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, then you got to take a shower and --
R:  Yeah.  It's really a time commitment, but --
L:  Yeah.  And you catch cold and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then it's financial too.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  You got to buy the right equipment and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- uh --
R:  And like the shoes.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Then you got to -- you know, I tried the gym, like, ten years ago and, yeah, it was all right, but then you know, they're trying to sell you the trainer and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, the -- you know, this -- and then you need the clothes and uh, you know, everybody's all decked out in all their workout clothes and you feel like a schmuck when you come in with your old T shirt and everything.
R:  Yes.  [LAUGH].  Yeah, I feel like when I go, everybody's watching me.  Like, what the hell is she doing here?   [LAUGH].  It's so --
L:  Yeah, right.  They're watching ya and how many reps is he doing and --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  -- how many miles did he walk or, you know, what's he pumping?
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  You know, just leave me alone.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  No.  But you know, I think it's one of those things, but you know, they keep you -- every time you turn to read, there's always an article about health and there's all -- they're always telling you -- you know, I'm a smoker, I know I got to stop that, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, you know, it's -- again, it's easier said than done.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah. 
L:  Ah, but who knows?
R:  Mm.
L:  Who knows what this -- I mean, like I said, if they came out with a [inaudible] I'd be the first one to buy it.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  You know?  But uh, it's just -- the wacky world, you know?
R:  Mm.
L:  And uh, but you should -- you -- you know, you got the campus and everything.  You should be taking advantage of it.  
R:  I know I should.  Especially since my parents are paying so much money for me to be here.  [LAUGH].  Like, I should utilize the facilities better, but -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't--
L:  Yeah, so they got nice facilities and everything, right?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, they are really nice.  It's really new.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know, I just -- I don't really enjoy it.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, like I -- this whole conversation started.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  It's too much effort.
R:  It is.  
L:  Yeah.  And uh, you know, all -- all you're gonna do is live uh five years longer or something or --
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  You know, it's uh -- you know, just be more taxes and everything we're going be paying for another five years.  More bills and everything else.  
R:  Mm.
L:  I got my neighbors are here.  
R:  Mm.
L:  Walking over, seeing my dog.  I play catch with the dog every day.
R:  What kind of dog is it?
L:  Huh?
R:  What kind of dog is it?
L:  Ah, it's a black lab.
R:  Oh, okay.  Those are pretty active.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, he's a -- he's -- if I could exercise anywhere, like, he -- he's just a bundle of energy.  
R:  Yeah --
