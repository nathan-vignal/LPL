R:  Uh, hi.
L:  Hi.  
R:  Hi, my name --
L:  I'm Melanie.
R:  -- is Angela. 
L:  Hi.  
R:  And uh, well, I guess regarding that subject, as far as um books are concerned --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- I taught for fourteen years in a school.  I think uh --
L:  You say you taught?
R:  Yes, I taught --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- for fourteen years in --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- in an elementary school, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I guess as far as that's concerned, ah, if parents decide individually that they don't want their children to read certain books, I guess that's up to them, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- for the -- the -- the greater opinion of the school, I think it ought to be -- be open to -- to them to decide what they want the kids to do.  I mean, what is the -- what is your opinion on that?
L:  You think the schools should decide?  
R:  We- well, I think that the parents should decide individually what they want their -- their kids to do.  
L:  Oh, right.  I thought --
R:  Yeah, I don't think that --
L:  -- it sounded like --
R:  -- the -- the school should legislate what the individual parents want to do.  I -- I mean, because --
L:  No, no, but it -- it -- the subject sounded to me like should the schools have the say.  
R:  Oh, no, no.  As far as the schools having the say --
L:  No, but that's what -- that's what it sounded the question was --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- should the schools --
R:  Yes.  Wha- you know, what is your feeling on that?
L:  I say, no, they shouldn't.  
R:  Yeah.  I think as far as the -- the parents uh -- so much is taken out of the parents' hands sometimes as far as --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as that goes.  That's probably a large part of why I'm not teaching any more.
L:  Oh, really?  Where did you --
R:  Ah, yeah, because the -- I don't know, the -- the school is -- it's kind of having to -- to be the -- the -- the person that sets the tone for everything now.  And I think they ought to be left in the hands of the parents individually. 
L:  Right.  Right, but -- I'm sorry, I think my husband just spilt something.  What happened?  I -- ah, I'm on the phone, I'll be there in a minute.  That wasn't --
R:  I mean, do -- do you have kids --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- in school?  [LAUGH].
L:  Pardon?
R:  Do you have kids in school?
L:  No, they're in their twenties, but they've been through the public school system in Los Angeles, so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- like where -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- where are you?
R:  Yeah, I ah, I'm in Las Vegas. 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, but it -- but I -- my husband and I have only been out here five years, so we're -- we're from down south basically --
L:  Yeah, I can hear your accent.
R:  -- and uh, they're very conservative out there as far as, uh, schools are concerned.  It's -- it's -- you know, and -- and especially as it, uh, deals with that particular subject. 
L:  Right.  I'm trying, you know, what -- what the recording said was, do you feel that the school has a right to say what should -- I mean, they have -- obviously they have the choice of what should be in their own library.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So I don't know how they can dictate what kids read when they're home, 'cause they can't --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- although they can say you can't do a book report on such and such a book.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Which I can understand because uh, but -- but -- uh, I don't know.
R:  I don't know, as -- as far as it goes, I -- like I said, there may be some parents that don't have a problem with their children reading particular books, so it's not a problem for them --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and in other homes, uh, their --
L:  [COUGH].
R:  -- parents really do have a -- uh, a problem with it.  For instance, I've known some parents that have no problem with uh, the Harry Potter books.
L:  Mhm.
R:  On the other hand, I've known some parents that have, uh, uh -- you know, uh, because of religious reasons --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they have their own opinion about that.  They don't want their child reading the books and, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- exposed to the books, so it -- sometimes it's kinda -- it's basically an individual thing sometimes.
L:  Right.  Yeah, right.  If -- if a school wanted a child to read something that the parents don't, that's one thing, but um, but there have been cases I've read where -- where a book is deleted from a library because of the -- the school system decides.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  Not -- not -- not the students, not the parents, not the public.  It's completely with the school and a public school.  You know?
R:  Yeah, I -- and probably that's -- that's more of a problem with a public school than a private school.  Private schools, I think, work a little bit more along with what the parents want.  I mean, number one --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because they're -- they're paying to --
L:  Oh, yeah. 
R:  -- put their child there in the school, so they're -- they're -- the -- they're more prone to work along with the parents.  Public schools are -- are a whole different deal.
L:  Right.
R:  I know, you know, you -- like I said, having worked in one for fourteen years, uh, that's kind of how they are.
L:  Right.  Right.  Um, I'm trying to think of a specific instance, which I can't right now, um, but um, but do you remember exactly what the question was?
R:  I think it was as far as, uh, [MN] private and public schools, do you think they have a right to -- to um ban certain books or tell -- in other words, I guess --
L:  [COUGH].
R:  -- say students, uh, have to read a particular book, do they -- do they have the right to --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to say that?
L:  Yeah, yeah.  No.  I mean, I don't think so.  I mean, they -- they have the right to ban it because it's -- you know, they're -- they're in control, but as far as um -- well, let's put it this way, a ch- a child could read a book and wanted a book report and the teacher says, "No, that's not appropriate", and that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- happens.
R:  Yeah, where -- where I --
L:  I've seen it happen.
R:  Where I taught school, was in -- in Virginia and I --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- not in my particular school district, but there was uh, one of the school districts, uh, where some of the parents, uh, taken exception to -- I -- I think it was a -- Adventures of Huckleberry Finn --
L:  Mm.  Mhm.
R:  -- so they all wanted it taken out of the school because they said it was --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, right.
R:  -- it had, uh, racial overtones --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and things like that, but -- but they had to understand the time or the period of time --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that Mark Tra- Twain wrote the book --
L:  Mm.  Right.
R:  -- and the period of time that he wrote the book, it was really kind of liberal in terms of, you know, what the thinking was at that time, but instead of reading the entire book and, you know, looking at the fact that it was written during that particular uh period of time, they just wanted to -- to ban the book without, you know, considering that.
L:  Right.  Right.  And -- and kids will learn about things anyways.  Um, the whole sc- school system has changed anyway, from you know, when we were in school.  Um --
R:  Uh, very, very radically.  I mean --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- we didn't really have to worry that much about what we read in uh high school, that there was like a book list that they give you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in high school.  You had so many books you can read --
L:  Right.
R:  -- uh, that you had to choose from and that was it, but I mean, there was -- at least where I grew up, there was nothing controversial about it.  
L:  Right.  I mean, you have to -- you know, who's doing the deciding?  What -- what is their political views and their morals and whatever, they put that on the rest of us.  
R:  Yeah, and they're -- they're just as --
L:  You know, it's -- it's not a vote, it's -- it's um certain minority of people that are -- are choosing, that are making the rules.
R:  And there's just this --
L:  And deciding what's appropriate.
R:  -- risk to be politically correct all the time about things -- 
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- I find.
L:  We -- we don't get the chance to decide what's right, you know, it's uh, a few people that are deciding that.  
R:  But I mean, if there -- for instance, well, my -- my step kids are all grown now, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, if there was an instance when they were younger and there was, uh, a book that, say, my husband and I disagreed with them reading --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I -- I would sit down with them, explain, you know, why we had those feelings, go over it, uh, you know and discuss it with the child so that they knew. 
L:  Right.
R:  It's something about the -- the nature of kids, that when you ban something, it makes them want to read it that much more.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Right.  Definitely, and I -- I don't know.  It's uh -- I'm try- I'm trying to think of a case, you know, where -- but you're right about Huckleberry Finn.  Um, I -- I don't think I ever had a problem with my kids, as far as books or -- or being told to read something that we didn't think was right.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  But um, I don't know.  I -- I -- you can't fight -- I don't think it's right.  
R:  It's just --
L:  It's always gonna be --
R:  -- like I said, where school systems as far as books are concerned and things like that, that the -- the individual parent has the right.  I mean, really if -- if their child, if they don't want their child to read a certain book --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they have the right to tell the -- the -- the uh, teacher, "Look, I -- I have a problem with that book".
L:  I think so.
R:  "I don't want my child reading that" and -- and most teachers for the most part will be glad to -- to uh, you know, say, "Well, you have an option".
L:  Right.
R:  "Let your child pick another book" and there's usually not a problem.
L:  Right.  Absolutely.  And then uh -- but then I never have a child read the book the teacher doesn't think is appropriate, the teacher has the say. 
R:  Yeah.  I -- I mean, I -- sometimes I think there is much too much made over --
L:  Mhm.  Absolutely.
R:  And by them, you know, making such a big deal of it, all it does is just make the problem a lot bigger than it needs to be.
L:  Right.  Right.  Um, oh I know, what -- where's that book gone?  Oh, goodness.  Um, um, can't think of the -- the author.  It's children's books.  Um, something, "God, it's me, Margaret".  You know what I'm talking about?
R:  No, which is it -- what -- what's the --
L:  I can't --
R:  -- name of it?  
L:  I can't -- I can't think of the exact name.  I can't remember.  It's -- it's a very well known children's author, mostly girls' books.  A -- a lady. 
R:  I can't think of it.
L:  Oh, I can't remember the -- the title of the book right now, whether that was --
R:  Is it Judy Bloom?
L:  Yes.
R:  Yes.
L:  Yes.  Yeah, and my kids are so old, I can't remember.  Yes.  [LAUGH].  It was Judy Bloom.  It was one of her books and I remember that was uh, an issue, do a book report on one of those.  Something -- it was something -- the girl's name was Margaret in the book.  
R:  I -- you know, even sometimes in -- in the case of that, if it's not, you know, just -- really too controversial for the parents --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it might be good sometimes to take the book and read it with the child --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and you know, then if you have -- have uh, the parent has problems with it, then they could explain to their child, "This is what I don't like.  This is what I disagree with".
L:  Mhm.  
R:  Then at least sometimes they don't feel like they're kind of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- alienated from everybody else as far as the -- you know, not reading or reading something.
L:  Yeah, there's a lot --
R:  But -- but I think that -- especially when they get older, they're going to want to do it anyway because they -- peer pressure's very strong.
L:  Mhm.  So they -- 
R:  I mean, I worked in --
