R:  Hi, my name is Wendy.
L:  Hi, my name is Rita.
R:  [SIGH] Hi.  Um, so, do you exercise regularly? [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] No, I can't say --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- say that I do regularly.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  Um, [SIGH] I do it more in the summer months for some unknown reason --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- rather than the winter months, how about you?
R:  [SIGH] No, I need to, but I don't. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] I recently had a baby and I just [SIGH] -- I keep telling myself, "Oh, I'm going to get back in shape" but it's just, like, I say it and I'll do it for one day, and then I stop. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. [LIPSMACK] I have a --
R:  [MN] [COUGH] 
L:  -- thirteen year old that wanted to start [SIGH] because he's [MN] getting into the point that he's paying more attention, you know, to his [SIGH] physique and everything --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so he wanted to start and [SIGH] I said, "Okay, we will when school is out".  You know, I always keep putting it off.
R:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH] 
L:  Mm.
R:  That sounds like me. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, when you got homework at night --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it is kind of hard to juggle everything that you need to do.
R:  right.
L:  [SIGH] And he wanted to join a fitness place --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so that means [MN] driving back into town, which for us is, like, ten miles, so you --
R:  Right.  
L:  -- just have to add everything up and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and weigh it and see which way, you know [NOISE] -- but hopefully when the summer starts [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we can get started on something like that. 
R:  [SIGH] I know, that's, um -- I'm planning on doing something like that too --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- hopefully I'll stick with it. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  My sister, [SIGH] she's due with her baby next month and afterwards she wants me to start [SIGH] exercising at a gym with her too, so I thought, "Well, if I pay the money to join a gym that'll be a little bit of motivation for me". [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, some --
R:  [SIGH] I'll feel like I need to use it. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, sometimes that --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- works better too, if you've got somebody to go with you because --
R:  Right.
L:  -- he wanted me to join with him.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  He does -- [LAUGH] He didn't --
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  -- he didn't want to go and I said, "Well, yeah, I need to go".
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Yeah. [SIGH] 
L:  But, um, sometimes I got to find the money too.
R:  I know, they're so expensive.
L:  [NOISE] Very much so.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We live in such a small town there's only one, so there's no competition.
R:  Mm, wow. [SIGH] 
L:  So --
R:  Yeah, I um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] -- there's several of them in my town.  I wanted to join the Y.M.C.A. but [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- they are a fortune there. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, really?
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, I thought, well, you know, I always see these commercials, and it says, [SIGH] "Bringing communities together".  So, I'm like, "Well, you know, that's probably and inexpensive place, it's for the community and stuff" and [SIGH] I called and it's, like, two thousand dollars a year for a family membership. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Oh, my gosh. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] We don't --
R:  [SIGH] Think the --
L:  -- have a Y --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [MN] the closest one to us is in the next town and --
R:  [SIGH] Uh.
L:  -- we did join just, uh, for swimming lessons, but --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- that was fifty dollars.
R:  Right, that's funny you mention that, we just joined that t- today --
L:  Oh, you did?
R:  -- [SIGH] so we're -- we're going to do the swimming lessons, 'cause it's sixty dollars here, but [SIGH] I thought, "Well, that's not bad" but we're not going to be joining for the gym part. [LAUGH] 
L:  No, that -- that's outrageous, I don't think they want --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- many people to join at that price.
R:  I know, and they have, like, a hardship program for, like, low income, but we didn't qualify for that, so it's like, "Whatever.  What about the middleclass people here?" [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] "We're not rich --"
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  "-- we're not poor we can't --"
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  "-- we can't -- we can't get in either way". [LAUGH] 
L:  That's very true.
R:  But uh --
L:  Gosh.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  But I would have to join somewhere like that because I just can't seem to do anything on my own.
R:  Yeah, me too. [SIGH] 
L:  I've been trying to put myself on a diet. [MN] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  I try not to say diet because my husband said, "Well, you know it's what you're supposed to eat for the rest of your life".  So, it's --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- so I've been trying that too.
R:  Mhm. [SIGH] 
L:  But, uh, it's hard.  Everything you go at it looks like it's hard.
R:  Mm, it is, it really is. [SIGH] My weakness is fast food, you know, I go into town and then it's so convenient, so I just swing into McDonalds or wherever and  [SIGH] [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, that can be a habit. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I had to break that.  I made myself say, "If I'm going to do that, it's only going to be a salad".
R:  Right, well, see --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- [SIGH] I wish I could have that willpower for myself, you know. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Well, that's one thing, I have been able to say that I've conquered that.
R:  Right, that's good, though.
L:  Yeah, so I said, I had to start somewhere.
R:  I -- I did that for, like, two weeks and I lost three pounds and I thought, you know, this is it, this is the fast food.  If I could lay off of it, [SIGH] you know -- 'cause I need to lose ten pounds, that's my goal and if I could just get down that ten pounds -- I think I could do it I should just l- lay off the fast food, you know. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, but you say you just had a baby?
R:  Yes. 
L:  H- 
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  How -- how recent?
R:  Oh, not recent, he's -- he just turned two, but --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- it's like -- it wasn't like [SIGH] I just had him.  I weighed one twenty two when I got pregnant.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [SIGH] And then I gained twenty nine pounds, and when I came home from the hospital [SIGH] I was one twenty six [SIGH] and I only was, you know, four pounds over my pre pregnancy --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- weight --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] but then, instead of losing, I gained another --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- four pounds, so now I'm, like, up to a hundred and thirty. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's just like, [SIGH] "What the heck?  I thought I would lose after I had the baby, not gain". [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Is that -- was that your first?
R:  Yes, yeah.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, well --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- [SIGH] I know it sounds like you don't need to lose a lot, but every pound is hard. [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah, it really is. [SIGH] Mm, but my mom's like, "Just exercise and you can get it off" but [SIGH] --
L:  Easier said than done.
R:  It's just -- yeah, exactly.  I think if I had a treadmill or something [LAUGH] --
L:  [SIGH] [SIGH] No --
R:  -- 'cause I'm not like [LAUGH] --
L:  -- [LAUGH] I do and that doesn't help either. [LAUGH] 
R:  Really? [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] No, because it's -- I don't know, it's tiresome and I get very bored --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and, um, I -- I don't know, I'm tired -- I'm -- I'm just as tired when I get through --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- as I was when I started. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, gosh. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] So, no. [SIGH] I --
R:  Well, it's --
L:  Go ahead.
R:  It -- it's just so hot.  I live in Florida and it's, like, uh -- are you in Florida too?
L:  Virginia.
R:  Oh, okay, well, see, down here it's, like, a hundred degrees outside. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And [MN] during the day time you just do not go outside unless you're going swimming or [SIGH] something like that and I just -- you know, I -- I don't go out there and walk.  If it was cool weather, I think I would go out there, but --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it's just so disgustingly hot and humid here. [LAUGH] 
L:  What-- which part of Florida?
R:  I'm in central Florida.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  In Ocala.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I have one relative that lives in Pensacola.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So they're north Florida, yeah.
L:  [SIGH] I always wanted to go there.
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] it is, it's nice, it's really nice up there.
L:  But, uh, don't guess I'll ever get that far south. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Do you ever go out much of the state?
R:  [SIGH] Um, not a whole lot.  I do want to go up to the mountains.  I would love to travel up to Virginia, that's -- my mother and father in law go up there a lot, like, every year they have a time share and they go up to Virginia.  They love it.  They go, like, in October.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [SIGH] Because, you know, you guys have fall and we don't, so --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Oh, that's true.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.  That's one thing I look forward to after all the heat. [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And I think that's another reason, you know, it's hard to exercise in the summer, it's just so hot.
R:  It is.
L:  And humid.  We're really humid through here.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Well, um --
L:  So, um --
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] I don't know, [MN] I live, like, right next to a hiking trail thing and I've lived h- in this house for a year now, and my husband's like, "Why don't you ever go over there to the hiking trail and [SIGH] walk?" [LAUGH] I'm just like --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  --"I guess I'm not motivated enough".
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, you have to have --
R:  [SIGH] It's terrible.
L:  -- somebody with you to make you go.
R:  I know. [LAUGH] 
L:  I think I found that in -- in -- in all, [NOISE] uh, ways, that anything I tr- you know, tired to do for exercise --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you got to have --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- a partner.
R:  But then again, I have a neighbor and she's always like, "Let's get together and walk" and we've been saying that for months. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah, and now it's too hot to do that.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] [SIGH] And then I tell my husband, "Well, if I had a bike, you know, maybe I'd ride that".
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] And before it was, "Well, if I had roller skates" and he bought roller skates and I've never even used them, they're still sitting in the closet. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  maybe you could get one of those little car seat type things you could --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- put on the back of your bike.
R:  I know, that's what I've been telling my husband. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um --
L:  I don't know, then maybe your -- is it a s boy you say you have?
R:  Yeah, mhm.
L:  Maybe he would enjoy that.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, 'cause he loves it outdoors.  That's the thing, he -- he loves it outside, and I enjoy going outside, it's just so hot here.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  It's like, if you don't get out first thing in the morning, it's -- forget it. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Unless you're going to the river or the beach. [SIGH] 
L:  Has it gotten hot already?
R:  Oh, gosh, yes.  It is terrible, it's been hot since --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] probably the end of February.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Its just -- we don't have spring or fall here, so 
L:  Well --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- for goodness sakes, I didn't realize it wouldn't -- y- you know, it would be cooler [MN] by now.
R:  [SIGH] Um --
L:  I didn't know it would be that hot.
R:  Oh, yeah, it's terrible, it is really bad out. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  [SIGH] It kind of just jumps from summer to winter and then right back to summer. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, we've had a little spring.  We've had a lot of rain.
R:  Really?
L:  [SIGH] We got, like, almost five inches night before last.
R:  Wow.
L:  So, yeah, it's been too much. [SIGH] 
R:  Wow, that's a lot of rain.
L:  Yeah, and then when it gets humid it is yucky outside, so --
R:  Yeah, and then you don't want to go out and do anything [SIGH] 
L:  No.
R:  -- like that. [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] No.
R:  So, I guess my exercise is walking the mall. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] Well, that's good too, you --
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  -- you see a lot of people that really do that.
R:  Uh-huh, [SIGH] it is.  I do -- I usually'll put my baby in the stroller and just stroll around there [SIGH] for a good hour or two once a week. [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.  So, you're a stay at home mum.
R:  Yes.
L:  Well that's good.
R:  Yeah, I enjoy staying home with him [SIGH] but I just don't -- I don't think I would trust anybody in a daycare.  I mean, [SIGH] I don't know, I just feel like, uh, I had him and I should raise him. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right, that was --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- attitude, I did the same thing.
R:  Really?
L:  And mine's thirteen and I'm still home, yeah.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah, 'cause, um, y- you miss that and you never get it back.
R:  Right, [MN] yeah.
