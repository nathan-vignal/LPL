R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  
L:  Hi.  
R:  My name's Becky.
L:  Hey, it's Mariana.  
R:  How, where --
L:  How you doing?
R:  -- are you from?
L:  I'm from Philadelphia. 
R:  Uh, hello.  I'm from Minneapolis.  So, I guess we're supposed to talk about censorship in schools.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  What do you think --
R:  What do you think?
L:  -- about it?
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  Um, I don't think schools should allow any kind of censorship, unless it's something that's really threatening.  I mean, I don't know, like I guess some schools have tried to ban, like, Harry Potter --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- and I think that's just -- that's ridiculous, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And even when I was in -- when I was in grade school, like, they tried to -- they had us reading Narnia books --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- which were, you know, just as, like, weird and mystical as Harry Potter, so I mean, whatever.
L:  Right.  
R:  Anyway, what do you think?
L:  Yeah, I don't think that there should be censorship in schools.  I think it's, like, ridiculous.  You know, and -- you know, and if -- if you tell kids not to read something, more than likely --
R:  They're gonna to want to read it --
L:  -- they're going to go out --
R:  -- even more.
L:  -- and read it even more.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  But, like, you know, I -- kids today see so much other stuff, like the news and like, you know, MTV and everything, I don't think that, you know, necessarily reading a book is really a bad thing.  'Cause I mean, if you're reading a -- if you're reading something in school, more than likely you're going to be discussing it.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  So you're gonna get, like, you know -- okay, this could be, like, a dangerous book because of, you know, A, B, C, or D or whatever.

R:  Right.  Right.
L:  And then -- they discuss it, so I don't think that there should really be censorship about any --
R:  How old are you?
L:  I'm twenty six.  
R:  Yeah, I'm twenty nine and, like, I totally remember back in grade school, like, Judy Bloom books were like a big deal.
L:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
R:  And, like, you know what I mean?  And I remember, like, they -- they wouldn't let us read, like, the -- I was in a public school and, like, they made a big deal about, like, that book, Tiger?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Or whatever.  I think that's what it was called.  It was like the really -- it was, like, the one Judy Bloom book that had, like, lots of sex in it.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  And they made such a huge deal out of it, and now that I'm older and I look back on them, like, oh my God, that book was so tame.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It was so tame.  I'm like, wha- you know, and they would -- tried -- they, like, took that book off the shelves and, like you know, there's this huge controversy in our school about it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because it was, like, too mature and there was too much sex and there was, like, two sex scenes in the entire book that were so vanilla.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- you know what I mean?  And so, I don't know.  And that was back in, like, that was in the eighties.  
L:  Right.
R:  So it's just, like, I don't know, you know?  But, I don't know.  I mean, like, I don't know, I've read one Harry Potter book and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I think -- I thought it was awesome.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I can't believe that, like, there's public schools that are trying to ban that. 
L:  Yeah.  I haven't -- I've -- haven't really read them, I'm not into the whole, like, mythological thing, but I -- but I know, like -- I thought it was good that kids were, like, rushing out to order, like the night it came out before.  Like, I drove home that night from work and it was like all these kids and I'm like, what the hell is going on?  [inaudible].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  And it was, like, the night it came out.  I think it's a good thing that kids are, like --
R:  Reading --
L:  -- reading.
R:  -- anything.  Ever.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  That they can be excited about something that, you know, they drag their parents out to see.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  To get the book or whatever.  So I think that it's a good thing, that they're reading and all.  I mean, certainly --
R:  I don't think I'd --
L:  -- if they were reading, like, you know, Penthouse or something, I wouldn't want --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, to read something --
R:  I mean, I don't think that there should be, like, romance, like -- like, really steamy romance novels available -- available in, like, public school libraries to elementary school kids.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, that would be bad because some of those are pretty, you know -- I don't know.  But, I mean, there shouldn't be, like, Harlequin novels --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  -- like in -- in grades one through six.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's just, uh, I don't think so.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  I mean, I don't know.  Did you ever read Nancy Drew when you were -- when you were little?
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, like, that was -- she was totally my hero and then, like, in the late eighties, they tried to, like, remake Nancy Drew and, like, right, there were these new Nancy Drew books that came out that had total sex scenes with, like, her and Ned in a hot tub and I was, like, [MN] oh, my God.  You know?
L:  I remember the covers even were, like, not Nancy Drew.  Like -- like, you know, like you'd look at the covers and she'd have, like, a tank top on or something.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  And be, like, you know, the sexy Nancy Drew.
R:  I mean, I read the -- totally.  And I read the old Nancy Drew books where she was, like, you know, the titian haired, like, you know, knee lengthed skirt girl who was, like, selling mysterious --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And in the late eighties, they tried to make into, like, [inaudible] High Nancy Drew.
L:  Right.
R:  Which was, like, my God. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  They thought that was appropriate for, like, thirteen year old girls and I'm like, oh my God.
L:  Mhm.  I remember even when we were in school, we read, um, um -- what's the book with Holden Caulfield?  Um --
R:  Uh, uh, Catcher in the Rye.
L:  Yeah, Catcher in the Rye, and I remember, like, our teacher was telling us that, like, this book could've been -- was like a banned book or whatever.  And, like, it was, you know, racy and you know, it made us go out and really read it.  You know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- not just say we read it.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  And, you know, we were like, it's -- there's nothing really wrong with that, you know?  
R:  No.
L:  Or like Lord of the Flies.  I know that's like a banned book now.
R:  Oh, my God.  That's so crazy.
L:  Which is like --
R:  Why?
L: -- a -- which is like an amazing book.
R:  Yeah.  But why is it banned?
L:  Because there's, like -- bec- I think it's 'cause they eat each other.  But just, like, that's such a little bit of the book, you know?  Like --
R:  I remember, like, very vaguely reading that and -- and I remember, like, the fact that they ate each other was so vaguely alluded to.
L:  Yeah.  It was, like --
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  -- towards -- it was toward the end, but like, you know, okay, why did they -- look at why they did it, you know?  Forget about --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the fact that, you know, they did it.  You know, there was a reason why and it was the whole collapse of, like, the society and that nobody was, like, whatever.  But, yeah, I think -- I think kids are --
R:  I went -- I went to --
L:  -- exposed to so much stuff today that books should be the least of people's worries.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  And concerns.  
R:  I don't know.  How can they ban Harry Potter and then, like, not ban, like, Vice City video games, you know?
L:  Right.  Exactly.
R:  I don't know, I was just at a Memorial Day, like, barbecue day.  It was, like, um, one of my friends and there were -- her whole family was there and the kids were downstairs playing these video games and I mean, I'm, like, twenty nine, and I felt like an old grandma, 'cause I was like, I can't believe these video games.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  And so I don't know where this -- why censorship doesn't apply -- applies to literature, but it doesn't apply to things like that.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  'Cause censorship is this -- I mean, like, literature is this old dinosaur of an institution and video games are, like, a marketable product.
L:  Right.  
R:  And that's just really weird that, like, people are up in arms about things like Harry Potter and up in arms about things like -- I don't know.  You know, but yet these video games can -- tend to be totally available to kids.
L:  Mhm.  It's so funny because, like, there was a big deal about the whole, like, Lord of the Flies thing here, and you know, parents were, like, "I cannot believe you're letting my child read this", and it's like, "Well, you let them, like, play video games" and "You let them, like --" you know?  
R:  Watch TV for five minutes --
L:  Listen to Eminem and they're, like, in fifth grade.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you know, it's like, let them be kids, you know?  They're in school.  They're in a place where they're gonna get an education about the book, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  It's not like, you know?  It's this -- it's like you -- you're -- they're home alone watching, playing video games when there's nobody -- no parent home or whatever, and --
R:  Right. 
L:  You know?  
R:  Wow.
L:  So, it -- it just amazes me, the people that jump on the soap box of, like, banned books and the education.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  But I suppose it would depend on the church and state deal too, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like I mean, if it was a private school, that I was paying a lot of money to ha- send my kid to, you know?
L:  Mhm.  
R:  I think I would feel differently about it if it was a public school.  You know what I mean?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, it was like -- if I was, like, paying for, like, a Christian education at a private school, and I was really Christian about it and really, like, you know, and I didn't want my kid to be reading this or that and they banned it, I'd be like, "yes", you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  But if it's a publicly funded school, I think that's a whole different animal.
L:  Right.
R:  And I think that's what people get in -- you know, that's taxpayers' money and I think that's where people get into a big, you know, get their undies in a bundle about -- I mean, if it was a privately -- if it was a private school and you were paying for that, it would probably be a different --
L:  Right.
R:  I don't know.  I mean, I'm not a parent, so it's really hard to say, too.  I mean, it's weird.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.  So, I guess, I don't know, I've got, like a -- I've got an eight year old niece and she goes to a private school.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's not, like, a religious school but it's private and it's just like the whole mindset of these parents that are paying for this is so different from, like, you know, free school.  [LAUGH].
L:  Right.
R:  They're so much more involved.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  And I think, like -- and topic like this, like if they decided to ban a book from, like, the private school library, there's like a whole, like, you know, parents' council meeting about it.
L:  Right.  [LAUGH].
R:  Over, like -- you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Whereas if it's, like, in a public school, there's just like this kind of broad, like, rule that's set that somebody says, "Okay, we're taking it off the shelf.  It's done.  Too bad.  Bye".
L:  Right. Right.  
R:  I'm just --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- amazed at the level of participation that parents take in a private -- in -- in public --
L:  Oh, yeah, definitely.
R:  You know, it's just -- it's really weird.  So --
L:  Mhm.
R:  She's at some, like, New Age, like weird private school.  A bit like, I don't know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  My sister's way into that whole, like, experimental whatever.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  And, like, why don't you just home school her, then you won't have to worry about anything, and they're like, "Well, you know", but it's just -- I don't know.  It's just strange, like, how -- how much more involved they are. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I went to public schools, so I'm, like, I don't know -- [LAUGH].  That's what appalls me, I guess.
L:  Mhm.
R:  'Cause my mom was, like, working class, like, single mom and she didn't ever get involved in my schooling at all.  
L:  Right.  
R:  Thank God.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
