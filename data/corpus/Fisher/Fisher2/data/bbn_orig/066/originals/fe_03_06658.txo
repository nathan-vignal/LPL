L:  Hello?
R:  Hello, my name is Kathy.
L:  Hi.  My name is Maria.
R:  Marla?
L:  Maria.
R:  Maria; it's nice to -- nice to talk to you.
L:  Same here.
R:  Is this your first call?
L:  Yes, it is.
R:  Okay.  Mine too, so we're gonna have to muddle through this.  Okay.  From -- my hearing isn't good, and I understand that we're supposed to talk about health and fitness --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and what we do for exercise on a daily basis?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay.  Would you like to start?
L:  Um, well --
R:  Or do you went me to?
L:  -- right now I'm trying to get into a routine.  I recently read an article, I think it was in last month's Women's Day magazine and it was about, like, starting a walking routine and that in six weeks you could walk you way to fitness.
R:  Okay.  We read the same article.
L:  [LAUGH].  Have you been trying that?
R:  Well, um, I spent seventeen years as a waitress and walking is probably the best for -- as far as my health is concerned, walking is probably the safest and most viable route for me to get to health and fitness.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But it's motivating myself to do it because after doing all that walking all that time, it's just like the last thing [LAUGH] so --
L:  Oh, I know that feeling.
R:  -- I'm still talking about it.  I have, um, tried the measuring the mile with the car --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to determine what my route would be, and I just haven't actually started.
L:  Oh well, I measured and I've -- I've been walking for three weeks now, and I'm not seeing a big difference.  I feel more tired, though, than coming home and chasing my four year old around.  I'm like, is this worth getting up that extra little bit in the morning, but --
R:  So it's not working for you?
L:  It doesn't seem to be working real well for me.  I don't know.
R:  Are you walking in a lot of heat?
L:  No.  It's been -- I'm in Ohio and it's been very cold and rainy here --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- still, so --
R:  Is walking something you enjoy doing?
L:  Yeah, I don't mind.  It's fun to get out in the morning and get myself ready for the day and not be, you know, in the house with a dozen people telling you to do a dozen different things, but --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].  Yeah.  Do you take your four year old with you when you go?
L:  No.  [LAUGH].  I tried that one day.  We spent more time chasing geese --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- than I have ever anticipated spending in my life.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  And after chasing those for a while, I was like, "Yep, we're not doing this one any more for a while", so -- we have a membership to the gym, but we've never used it one time.  Guess we --
R:  That is what I'm the most interested in, as far as health and fitness, is joining a gym.  Finances don't allow it, but I think I could go gang busters with that.
L:  My husband's company had a program where they offered it to us, so we got it at a huge discount, but it's still -- you know, we're paying for it, we don't -- we don't use it at all.  They don't have child care at the one closest to us, so by the time I would pay for somebody to watch her or go after my husband gets home for work, or on the weekends, we never get it fit in to the schedule, so I'm not sure that a gym is the right answer a busy mom.
R:  Yeah, that -- um, I have three children.  My children are seven, eight and nine years old --
L:  Oh, my.
R:  -- but the gyms around here do have child care and they're very good, well known gyms, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I'm -- my husband is very, uh, actively -- he's a construction worker for twelve hours a day and then he lifts weights, as -- as a hobby, literally.
L:  Oh, my.
R:  I suppose he could even be wanting to do that, but he is very, very physically fit and healthy and it makes me fit that a gym might be the way for me to go, but um, as far as -- we probably would want to do that together and I am also very self conscious about doing something wrong, looking --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- too heavy in my clothes, look- looking like a mother and everybody's twenty years old and perfect, you know?  I -- so --
L:  I know that feeling all too well.
R:  Watching too many commercials.  A lot of my exercise is pacing.  [LAUGH].
L:  Pacing?  Yeah?  I know that feeling.  I was like, well, you know, I should be physically fit from trips to the pantry during the day.
R:  Yeah.  And grocery shopping.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Surely you do that?
L:  Oh, yes.  That's a heavy duty one any more --
R:  Mhm.  
L:  Every time you go, you end up loading the whole bottom of the cart, and top, and --
R:  Yeah.  So, hey, let's think of the work out our arms are getting.  Mm.
L:  Oh.  I don't think it's helping the rest of me.  [LAUGH].  The rest of me is what needs it, so --
R:  There has to be something out there for us. 
L:  I would --
R:  I like to dance, but I haven't, um, been doing that much lately.
L:  Well, my daughter's in a dance class and they have a "Mommy and Me" program too, but I don't know anybody that takes that.  I'm more -- I'm not the most coordinated person in the world.  I can only imagine, if I look stupid exercising, how stupid I would look if I went to a dance class, so -- 
R:  I bet you we're both worried about that and everybody else is too busy worrying about how stupid they look to think how stupid we look.
L:  Probably.  I've been trying to eat healthier, hoping that that would help with the walking and I -- I marked in a picture how much eight glasses of water is a day.  I've been trying to get through that each day.  It's not been working qu- quite as well as one might anticipate, but it's getting there.  I've been making at least five of my eight for the past week, so I guess that's a start.
R:  Well, I guess you just reminded me about the importance of counting those glasses of water.
L:  Oh.
R:  Because I have a tendency to get all of my liquid from Coca Cola.
L:  Oh.
R:  And not -- not really good for you and I'll tell you what, when you crash, you crash and burn.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  So I've been trying to uh drink a -- more water.  I especially tend to drink water when I'm on the computer and um I fill glass -- I have to fill a glass all the way to the top with ice and have -- that glass has to be full of water, if it's not super cold, I won't drink it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So that's something that would probably affected the health and fitness level, too, is the ability to be able to drink it, and it sounds l- sounds like you, I would feel the need to be with somebody I knew, to participate in any kind of -- of regimen, you know, any kind of a program that -- I don't know, I would feel more comfortable with somebody with me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We have a beautiful -- we live in Florida, we have a beautiful bridge that would be perfect to walk over, you know, if it was ninety seven degrees out.
L:  Oh.  See, I could take the heat.  My little sister's in St Pete, and any time we go visit her, I don't, you know, stay indoors at all.  It's the cold I can't stand.  We're -- we're at a whole seventy today, so going out walking this morning at about fifty four, in the damp because it rained, it's rained every day --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- for, like, the past four weeks, it's -- it's no fun any more.
R:  No.  
L:  I'm developing mild arthritis and I don't -- I don't enjoy the damp or the cold.  [LAUGH].  So kinda takes the fun out of it.
R:  Yeah.  So you read -- you're into the same Women's Day, have you been reading any of the -- um, the Denise Austin articles? 
L:  No.  Are those the ones that -- like, for the weird little exercise positions?
R:  Um, she uses uh -- but I'm not -- I read several magazines and I'm trying to wonder if this might be in Family Circle too.
L:  Oh.
R:  But um, one of -- the Denise Austin is a regular contributor to one of them, and I'm wanting to say it's Women's Day because that's my favorite and that's the one I read the most.  She, uh, uses -- I haven't tried it, I've looked at her, and you know, it's hard to look at somebody who's absolutely perfect in physique.
L:  Yes.
R:  And they're telling you what to do, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, it's so easy --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- they make it look effortless, but it looks either -- I see her using this gigantic ball and this gigantic rubber band [LAUGH] and um I'm pretty sure it's Denise Austin and I'm pretty -- that's the contributor, yeah, Denise Austin, and uh, she has a lot of different tapes, fitness tapes, a variety of them.
L:  Mm.  Might have to look for that.  I don't think I've -- I know I haven't seen any videos with gigantic rubber band.  I'm sure I would remember that.  I just know there's  a woman in that Women's Day that she's down on her knees and puts her leg up above her head and all kinds of weird things and I'm like, you know, after cleaning --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- up Cool aid or whatever gets on my kitchen floor during the day, I really don't feel like crawling around --
R:  Right.  That is --
L:  -- on my knees and doing anything --
R:  That is the biggest challenge --
L:  -- to exercise.
R:  -- for a mother, is to find the time to exercise and to want to do it after you've done everything you are supposed to do.
L:  Yep.
R:  And even after you haven't done everything you were supposed to do.
L:  That's -- I'm like, you know, I'm sorry, I'm not crawling around any more today.  
R:  The to do list that's never crossed off.  The up -- the last minute things that always come up, that's definitely something that's going to interfere with health and fitness.
L:  Yes, that -- that to do list always has exercise at the top of it and that one very seldom to never gets done.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's --
R:  I think I might make it to January second on that myself.  
L:  It's my --
R:  I'm thinking about going back to waitressing, because that might be a little bit -- you know, exercise for me, but what I have a tendency to do when I'm waitressing is to bulk up.  I have too big of arms, too big of legs, and not -- nothing proportionate to where it's supposed to be and then if I'm not waitressing, then it's flabby.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I feel -- you know, I feel -- honey, this is -- this is uh -- I will read that to you when I get off the phone.  Guaranteed.  Save that page.  Put a bookmark in.  Sorry about that.
L:  That's okay.  I work retail off and on, you know, when I really need it in the budget and I usually do stock positions and you go through that same thing, where you're lifting, so my upper body feels, you know, real good in shape, but I also -- you know, I worked in a grocery store here recently and I snacked all night because I -- you know, there is --
