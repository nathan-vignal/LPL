L:  -- [SIGH] have you ever done one of these --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- talks before --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- on the phone?
R:  No, I haven't, this is my f-
L:  Me neither. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Actually, this is my very first. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Usually they have me holding on the line for a long time. [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] How did you hear about this study?
R:  [SIGH] Um, I go to, uh, forums where they -- where they [NOISE] post chats, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] I mean, like, uh, notices [NOISE] and stuff [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and, uh, [NOISE] they had the, uh --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [NOISE] the study listed that you could [NOISE] participate. [NOISE] I was like, "Oh, I'll try it". [NOISE] You know.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] And you?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, a friend --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- emailed m- me --

R:  No? [NOISE] 
L:  How about you?
R:  [NOISE] Yes, I'm married, I don't have any [NOISE] -- I have, uh, [NOISE] two step daughters, [NOISE] but I don't have any children of my own. [NOISE] Mm.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. [SIGH] I wonder why --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  --they gave us a topic to talk about.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Do you think they're --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- just trying to get us to say certain words --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] for the study?
R:  [NOISE] No, I don't think so. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] No?
R:  No. [NOISE] I don't know -- I don't know a whole lot about it [NOISE] you know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [NOISE] so I guess [NOISE] this is my first one. [NOISE] But, um, [NOISE] do you exercise at home or in a gym or ? [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] I go to the gym.
R:  [SIGH] Do you? [NOISE] 
L:  Um, I either --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [MN] get on the treadmill or I do yoga --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and Pilates --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- and I bike --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- so, [NOISE] that's what I do.
R:  [NOISE] Ride the bike in the gym?
L:  [SIGH] No, I ride --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- my bike around town. 
R:  [NOISE] do you have trails? [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, there's trails.
R:  [NOISE] Like a -- bike trails [NOISE] and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] Do you?
L:  And it's -- like, I live in Philadelphia --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- so [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you can bike pretty much anywhere.
R:  [NOISE] In the city?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  I live in a small town. [NOISE] 
L:  Missouri.
R:  [SIGH] [NOISE] Exercise is good for you though. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] I like it. [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I like it because I can bring a CD to the gym and listen to it --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- while I'm on the treadmill --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- [LAUGH] because my CD player doesn't --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- work.
R:  Mm. [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] So, that's nice.
R:  [NOISE] Mm. [NOISE] Course I haven't been watching the clock either. [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, what are we supposed to be doing?
R:  [SIGH] They said ten minutes. [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] Oh, ten minutes?
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] They don't get on the phone or anything after that?
R:  [NOISE] I -- probably after they ask us some questions [SIGH] [NOISE] you know, push the buttons again. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [NOISE] So. [NOISE] [MN] [LIPSMACK] 
L:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] 
R:  [SIGH] Do you have any pets?
L:  [SIGH] Yes, I have a bird. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] What kind of bird?
L:  [SIGH] She's an Amazon parrot.  She's green.
R:  Oh, those are nice. [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, she's pretty cute.  I've had her since I was young, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- she's actually walking on my bed right now.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Does she talk?
L:  [SIGH] She says hello.
R:  Does she?
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] 
R:  I've got --
L:  [NOISE] Do you have any pets?
R:  I've got two cats. [SIGH] 
L:  What are their names?
R:  [SIGH] Two inside cats.  Uh, Sniffles [SIGH] and Sunday.
L:  Oh.
R:  And I call 'em --
L:  [SIGH] Why is --
R:  -- call em Poo Poo and Kitty Cat. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] Why are Sniffles called Sniffles?
R:  [SIGH] 'Cause she had -- I guess she had hay fever or some kind of --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- allergies or something when we first got her [SIGH] --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and she was always sneezing. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] Poor thing.
R:  And, uh, she still sometimes has little --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- bouts of it, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] I guess it's a s- spring allergies --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] that, uh, she gets [SIGH] and she'll be sneezing --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [NOISE] and, uh, they're --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- aunty and niece --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- they're related.
L:  [NOISE] Oh --
R:  So  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- that's pretty cute.
R:  [SIGH] They -- they definitely don't look alike, but they're -- they're related.
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  And, uh, [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they're -- they're definitely different. [NOISE] They have their own little personalities, you know. [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I really like cats, but I can't have one, 'cause the cat'll --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- try to eat the bird. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] I've actually lived with --
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
L:  -- a toothless cat before, [SIGH] so that was okay. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] You've had one.?
L:  [LAUGH] What?

R:  [NOISE] At the what? [NOISE] 
L:  He lost them.
R:  Mm. [NOISE] Mm --

L:  [NOISE] Yeah, he can eat regular --
R:  [NOISE] [MN] 
L:  -- food too.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Like, hard food.
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Mm --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that's pretty amazing.

R:  [NOISE] Yes.
L:  It's still gray outside.
R:  [NOISE] Yes. [NOISE] Very --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [NOISE] I just want to stay in bed and cover up. [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] So, how long have you had your bird?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Uh --
R:  Oh, a long time. [NOISE] 
L:  -- for -- she's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- thirteen, so --
R:  [NOISE] Thirteen? [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] I've had her --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- since she was little. [NOISE] 
R:  Mm. [SIGH] I had a [NOISE] cockatiel [NOISE] once [NOISE] and he was a very talkative bird. [SIGH] I took him outside at night and he flew away.
L:  Oh.
R:  I looked for him for days. [NOISE] [LAUGH] I was h- so heartbroken over that bird.
L:  Yes --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] I remember when I was little --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um -- well, when I was -- when I first had --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- her --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I guess was twelve or thirteen --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] and, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I went to dance class and I had left her outside --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- 'cause I'd always bring her outside --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- with me when I went to play --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- and I came home and there was --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- a thunder storm and I'd --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- forgotten about her 'cause I went up to my room --
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  -- [LAUGH] and she [LAUGH] -- and she --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- wasn't in my room.  It was like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- "Oh, no".
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  So I went outside --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- looking for her and she was up really high in a tree singing.
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  [LAUGH] It was pretty cute--
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- she was liking it. [SIGH] 
R:  [NOISE] But you got her back, huh?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] That's good. [NOISE] [SIGH] I guess mine was [NOISE] -- it was at night time, [NOISE] you know--
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and the bird didn't know where he was [NOISE] and, um, [NOISE] it was awful. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I heard him, [NOISE] you know, I could hear him [NOISE] for a long time [NOISE] but I couldn't ever get him to come down.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] [MN] [NOISE] That was terrible [NOISE] and we had cats. [NOISE] Or we had a cat [NOISE] at the time. [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH] [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] I've had several cats [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and, uh, [NOISE] always [NOISE] responsible for 'em, you know. [NOISE] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN] [NOISE] Having 'em spayed. [NOISE] I think it's best [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah, I think so too.
R:  -- [NOISE] to -- to have [NOISE] you know, your cats and dogs spayed [NOISE] and neutered. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah, [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] We do have a hobo cat outside thought that, you know, [NOISE] [SIGH] toms the neighborhood. [NOISE]

L:  -- that's in heat right now. [SIGH] It's pretty awful. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] They do make a lot of noise, don't they? [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  Mm. [SIGH] [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] So w- do you think they analyze our voices?
R:  [NOISE]

R:  [NOISE] I have no idea. [NOISE] I guess we'll find out, won't we?
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Maybe they just give you a topic so you have something to talk about with a stranger.
