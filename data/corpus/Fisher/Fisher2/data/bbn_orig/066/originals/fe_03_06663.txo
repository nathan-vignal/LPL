R:  This is --
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?  Hi.
L:  Hi, this is Michelle.
R:  Oh, this is Delores.
L:  Hello.
R:  Yeah, Delores.  Can you hear me?
L:  Yes, I --
R:  Oh, okay.  My name is Delores, and no, I don't exercise that much.  Only thing I do is walk.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, I guess I walk some, too.  I do block patrol in my neighborhood.
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  So I -- I go out about two hours twice a week for that.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, wow.  Well yeah, well that's -- that sounds like enough exercise anyway.  I weight two hundred fifty, and it's really hard, you know, for me really to exercise anyway 'cause I have, like, a bad leg.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Well, actually, I used to play sports in, like, high school and college.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I mean, huh, I me- I know I ran, I used to run ten miles a day.
R:  Oh, yes.  Yeah.  Well, you know --
L:  But --
R:  Yeah.  Well, I used to do that in high school, swimming and a whole -- as a matter of fact, my mother has a swimming pool at the house and uh every summer I go there and I say, okay, I'll swim about one or two laps and then that's it for me.
L:  Yeah, I don't really like swimming so much.  Um, my mom --
R:  No?
L:  -- was, um, she lives on a lake and I grew up near a lake, but it wasn't -- I don't know, I just don't like swimming.
R:  It wasn't like --
L:  I -- I like to -- I used to go out in the boat and, like, just try the water.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Mainly I don't like to touch the bottom of the lake.
R:  Ah.
L:  It scares me.  [LAUGH].
R:  That means you must be looking at a lot of scary movies?  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, I guess.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, but I started that, then they had this new program, uh, I'm in Georgia, so they have this new place out, uh, it's supposed to be heavy set women, for heavy set women.
L:  Mhm?
R:  Who, um, don't get enough exercise or scared to go to the gym or anything.  Supposed to be real good.  I keep saying I'm [inaudible] people to see how much it really is. 
L:  Well, that's going to be summer, so everybody wants to work out now.
R:  Yeah.  But see --
L:  At least -- well, I'm in -- yeah, go ahead?
R:  Go ahead?  No, go ahead.
L:  I live in Minn- I live in Minneapolis so it's just getting warm now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, our snow just left a couple of weeks ago.  [LAUGH].
R:  Mm.
L:  So everybody just wants to be outside.  I do.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.  I know.  It's hot here.  It's really hot here.  It's about eighty something degrees now and I don't think any -- as a matter of fact, everybody's so hot it make you take their little siesta, so boy, it's a bit hot to do anything.  I'm up here trying to clean, cook and everything else so I guess that's enough exercise for me half the time. 
L:  Well, that's plenty of work.  [LAUGH].  Do you have nice places that you can walk?
R:  Oh, yeah, we have the parks and stuff and, you know, my daughter, she's here and she's always saying, "Well, come on, mommy.  Let's go, let's go", 'cause she was on her soccer team.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So she always want to, you know, run around and everything else.  As a matter of fact, she's a little bit on the heavy side.  And I say, "Goodness, girl, I don't know how you could do it" but then I say only the young could really do it.
L:  [LAUGH].  
R:  That's it, yeah, but exercise is all right.  I guess I just think, you know, it just -- you know, you have to either -- drink a lot of water to burn up the calories --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  You know, and I -- I feel half the time I only -- you know, nice days they stress so much upon, you know, thin is in, thin is in, thin is in, and I'm like, oh, you know, maybe to just have some -- just that we could just walk and just talk and whatnot, 'cause I did -- I just did the cancer walks so I guess that's enough exercise --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- for me.  We did a five mile walk and I came back and my feet was hurting.
L:  Mm.  That's -- that's nice to do that to raise money.  I've done the -- the MS bike race --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- before.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, my -- my dad actually runs marathons.
R:  He runs marathons?
L:  Yeah.  I could never do that.  That's just --
R:  Oh, goodness.
L:  That would be way too much pain, watching all those runners.  I mean, twenty six -- twenty six point one miles I think it is, or twenty six point two.  That's just insane.  [LAUGH].
R:  You got that right.  
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, I can't imagine running no marathon.  Not me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.  That's one thing I couldn't do, run.  I don't even run for the bus.  The bus -- bus leave, another one'll come.
L:  [LAUGH].  
R:  That's it.  I'm not running anywhere for nothing.  No, siree.  Uh-huh.  I don't even run when the dog is out here trying to chase people down.  
L:  Have you tried doing, like, videos or anything?
R:  Oh, yeah.  I had the Richard Simmons -- you know, the Richard Simmons one?
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  Um, I ordered his and um you know, the Oldies were Goodies, but then I thought --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't know, it's just --
L:  He's so silly.
R:  Huh?
L:  He's so silly.
R:  Uh-huh.  He is.  He really is silly.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  He really is.  He really is and I say, it's more than what he's doing, you know -- you know the exercise and stuff, he has to be doing something else because it just -- I just -- doesn't with me, doesn't just -- you know?  I'm like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh-huh.  No way.  
L:  I have some -- I have some yoga videos --
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  -- that I like to do, just for -- it's not too much exercise, but just to be flexible.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't know, it -- it still feels good to do it, you know?  Like, I'm doing something.  
R:  Oh.
L:  But I do- I -- I want to -- I want to start doing them of course, like, in a routine.
R:  Yeah, a routine --
L:  Like, actually doing it, like --
R:  -- like every morning?
L:  -- four -- like -- yeah, every morning or something.  
R:  Yeah.  My mother --
L:  And once I -- yeah, go ahead?
R:  Yeah.  My mother, she's seventy three years old and every morning she gets up at five o'clock in the morning to do her exercise.
L:  Oh.
R:  And I always say, "Bless your heart".  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I always say, bless her -- five -- five o'clock in the morning she does.  Five o'clock in the morning, she will get up and do her exercise.  But --
L:  A friend of mine gave me a video --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- and it's based on belly dancing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's actually like really fun.  It's -- it's like a really hard workout, though.  Like, my legs just hurt.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But it's like, for three days afterwards.
R:  Mm.  Yeah.
L:  But it's kinda fun.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, that's when you know, when your body starts hurting afterwards, that's when you know you've really had accomplished something.  Like, when I was in --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the Service, we used to get up five o'clock in the morning and I was gung ho then.  I was -- I was good to go then, but then I start -- ov- over the years, I'm just like, I can't do this.  I can't do this.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, but I don't know, exercise is all right.  Just have to have it in your heart, you know, something that you really want to -- you know, that you know you're going to do.  You know, don't give up on it.  I know me, I'm like, oh God, if I hurt one day, that's it.  
L:  [LAUGH].  I -- I kinda like it, when you're -- you know, when -- when you hurt and you know that you've --
R:  Yeah, they --
L:  -- you've got something.  You can, like, feel your stomach, your legs burning.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I like that kind of -- but I just -- it's -- it's hard, I guess, to find the time to do it. 
R:  That's just it.
L:  I mean, I wor- I work and I go to school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, I mean, I don't have a child, I'm sure that's plenty of time, too, but um it's just like when do I find the time, or make myself get up an extra hour early.
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  And I know nobody wants to be getting up extra early for that.  Uh-huh.  Oh, no.  Like, this has to be a routine, has to be a type of person that likes to stick, you know, that knows how to stick with things.  
L:  Yeah.  Now you're making me want to -- make me wanna to write out my routine now.  
R:  Mm.
L:  Make it four days a week, yoga, two days, walking, and such.
R:  Yeah.  Walking.
L:  [MN].
R:  Yeah, but they say the walking does help, but I don't see how.  Like, I have a -- a girlfriend of mine, she -- she was doing a Weight Watchers, but then she was also going to the gym.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And she was, like, treading on one night and then -- she said her body hurt for, like, two weeks straight.  Her abs and everything, but then she says she got over it and she just learnt how to fight the pain.  I'm like, oh God, I don't know about fighting any pain.
L:  Yeah, that's -- I think that's usually how I -- when you start working out again, it takes, like, two or three weeks --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- before you --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- get over all that pain.
R:  Yeah, it does.  Yeah.  that's it.  I guess that's probably why a lot of people stop after a while, once they get all that pain.  They're like, okay, no.  Can't do all that pain.
L:  Once you get over that, though, people are --
R:  Mhm.  
L:  -- just get -- I mean, like, my -- one of my cousins works out, like, twice a day.
R:  Mhm?
L:  And she plans her life around her workout schedule and it's --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- just like I could never do that.
R:  Mm.  Uh-huh. 
L:  I don't want to [LAUGH] you know, I don't want to end up like that.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  She's way too skinny.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We should -- all look like anorexia.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Well, she's working out all the time and she, you know, doesn't eat this or that and -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you gotta enjoy somethings.
R:  Yes.  See, you have to be able to enjoy some kind of something.  Just to let you know that you did good.  Yeah, you did a good job.  Yeah, yeah, where's my treat?  [LAUGH].
L:  Uh-huh.  That's how I feel.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, that's good, though.  Shoot.  I don't know.  I -- you know, all that exercise and whatnot and watching your weight and whatnot.   Do you really just don't enjoy your life.
L:  Yeah.  Unless you -- unless you can do something that's fun.  I mean, like you said, if you're walking with friends --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or if you're -- if, you know, biking with friends or your family or something --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You could enjoy that.
R:  Yeah.  Now, bicycle, I could do that.  I could do that all day long.  Riding a bike, yes, I can.  I --
L:  I could do that.  And mine got stolen.  I rode it one time and it just got stolen, so --
R:  Oh.  Wow.
L:  -- I have no bike now.  [LAUGH].
R:  What?  
L:  Yeah, it's sort of a -- one time I rode it.  
R:  Oh, that's a shame.  Now, bicycle riding is good.  You know, even when you get on the uh exercise bike.  Like, I have a exercise bike.
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  Now, sometimes I get on it and when I'm looking at my soaps, I will get on the bike and just sit up there and just ride the bike as I'm looking at my soaps, but that's a good two hours riding a bike.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Then I get off and it -- you know, it hurts all, like, between my legs and my legs hurt when I start walking around the house.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Then I treat myself to a ice cream bar.  
L:  Haha.  I love ice cream.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  That's it, yeah.  I'll treat myself right onto an ice cream bar and it's good.  I say, okay, I succeeded in doing something today.  [LAUGH].  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  So, yeah, but they're good though.  Exercise I just -- if I ha- if I had to do it, like I had to in the Service, I guess I --
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  -- would, but being out, I'm at the stage where I don't have to do it, I just don't.  No.
L:  What did you -- what did you have to do in the Service?
R:  Oh, we had to do uh we had to run five miles a day.  
L:  Wow.
R:  Every day we -- and you woke up at five thirty in the morning, you put on your clothes and then you'd go outside.  You'd do push ups, jumping jacks --
