R:  Trevor[?] [inaudible].
L:  Hi.  I'm Pat.  And I understand the topic's about private schools, whether or not they should, um, limit their students to read certain books.  Um, I guess they do have it -- have the right to do that.  What do you think?
R:  To read certain books?  Well, if they're sp- -- it's prescribed[?] education. [PAUSE] 
L:  And they're paying for it.
R:  Ah.
L:  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I guess they have the right to say whatever they want.  Um, I would think they would get a lot of comment from parents, um, because the parents are footing the bill and they want their kids to receive a good education.
R:  Sure.  That's true. [PAUSE] 
L:  Um, [PAUSE] trying to think what else. [PAUSE]  Did you go to a private school whenever you were young?
R:  No.  My sister did.  She went to Catholic school, but I never did.
L:  Yeah, me either.  I went to a public school the entire time.  And, um, I -- ah, even in public school I remember us, um, having to read certain books.  Like, um, is it Animal Farm?  It's about the boys on the beach.
R:  Ah, yeah.  Could be.
L:  Yeah.  That created quite a stir. [PAUSE] 
R:  Why?  People didn't like it?
L:  Um, yeah.  There were some parents that didn't like it because of some of the content of it.  Um, ah, they get, um -- they get pretty ruthless in some of the things they do to one another.  It's been a long time since I've read it -- um, a long time since I've read it.
R:  So, what grade was that?
L:  Um, I wanna say it was middle school.
R:  What year was that?
L:  Um, [LAUGH] I don't know.  I'll have to figure it out.  Like, early seventies.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  I have to think about that.  Um, so how did you find out about this Fisher study?
R:  I have a friend -- she's a social w- -- ah, she's completing her social work -- I --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- mean, her -- her schooling.
L:  Oh, okay. 
R:  And, ah --
L:  And she told you about it?
R:  Uh-huh.  [PAUSE] 
L:  Well, I have some friends on the Internet and they were telling me about it and that I ought to do it.
R:  They tell you it was pretty good and stuff?
L:  Um, yes -- yes.  Um, ah, there's been a lot of -- of various topics.  I tried to do it yesterday and -- and the topic was censorship and I never could get matched up with anybody.  Course, today it -- it loaded right away and matched me up with someone.  I don't know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what the problem was.
R:  Today -- yesterday was a holiday.
L:  Yeah.  That's probably --
R:  Memorial Day.
L:  -- that's probably what it was.  It was probably something with that.  Um, but, everyday I think there's been a different topic.
R:  Yeah.  So, I -- I'm -- you -- you only talk on it three day -- three times, huh?
L:  Yes, only three times.  And -- but, I think after that they can call you back.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  Um, if people, um -- I -- I don't know.  I don't understand.  But, if you refer some people or something they can call you back.  Now, did your friend tell you why they have these certain topics 'cause I wasn't told that?
R:  No.
L:  No, me either.
R:  They didn't tell me anything. [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay.  Just --
R:  She -- she ju- -- 
L:  -- that you're supposed to talk for ten minutes.
R:  Yeah.  She -- she just said, "Do it -- do it" you know, 'cause she wants me to -- to try to get, you know -- she wants me to do some other stuff, you know, under her.  So, um --
L:  Oh, okay. 
R:  -- trying to get that going too.  So --
L:  So, is she affiliated with the study?
R:  Well I don't know if she is, or not.
L:  Oh.
R:  She just sur- -- we do surveys too.
L:  Oh, okay. 
R:  We do -- we do [MN] you know, a chain of grocery stores, you know -- big chains and stuff like that.
L:  Oh.
R:  And this is one of the stuff that we do too -- ah, I do with her. [MN]
L:  Okay.  Because I had heard about it through, um, a coupon[?] group, so I thought maybe you were part of that group or something.
R:  Mm, no.  Ah, I don't know.  I don't think so.  I don't --
L: Ah.
R:  -- think she is.
L:  I wonder if she is.
R:  Ah, she could be, but I don't think so.  Who knows, or not?  I don't know.  
L:  Yeah. [PAUSE]  Um, well, as far as this censorship thing, I think they have the right to.  Um, I -- if I had my students -- my kids going to class like that I think I'd want to have a say in it, because there's some bad stuff out there.
R:  Yeah.  I think --
L:  And would --
R:  -- if people --
L:  -- you really want your kids reading it?
R:  Ah -- ah, I think --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- people should have free speech and should be able to voice their opinion.  If they don't like something they should be able to say that they don't like it.
L:  Yeah.  And -- and you have --
R:  Their fears[?].
L:  -- the right on your own to go and read whatever, but not to be required.  Um, when we lived in at Georgia, um, we had some teachers, um, that were, um, showing R rated movies at school.
R:  Ah, that's gross.
L:  And those kids were not seventeen.
R:  That's gross.
L:  Yeah.  So, we -- my husband sort of called some people -- board of education people.  And then they had to start sending letters home and they had to provide some alternative if, um, you didn't want your child to see some of this.
R:  Yeah, that's gross.
L:  Yeah.  But -- but, it's really sort of the same thing, you know.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Um, these books aren't rated like movies are, but --
R:  The connotation they get anyway.
L:  Yeah -- yeah.  The connotation's still there -- the same type of thing.
R:  Yes.
L:  And, um, it was actually a history class, and they tried to pass it off as, "Well, this is history".  Like, um, I know of 'em was, um, Schindler's List, and another one was The Last Of The Mohicans.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  And, yeah, those are good movies.  And, yes, they're about history -- true history.  But, there's still some pretty gruesome stuff --
R: Yeah.
L:  -- in there.  And do teenagers need to be seeing that?
R:  Yeah.  And do -- why -- why do they have to draw on that anyway?  Why can't they draw on something decent?
L:  Well, they said these were, you know, some --
R:  Something --
L:  -- of the --
R:  -- that makes --
L:  -- best --
R:  -- you think, and some -- ah, something --
L:  -- things that were coming --
R:  -- scientific of something?
L:  -- out about this.  And it was --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- pertinent to the things they were studying. So, that's how they justified it and said, you know, "We show this -- we want to show this".  And, um, they sort of ostracized the kids that the parents wouldn't sign the form, by making a big deal about it and sending them to the library.  And, um, yeah, sort of embarassing 'em -- to the point of embarassing 'em -- "Well, their parents won't let them see this good movie that explains history so much".  And I didn't think that was right either.
R:  No, it's not.
L:  So, I guess there's books for all of that.
R:  Entitled to your opinion.
L:  I mean, they could bring out those same type of books and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and say -- well, are they supposed to watch -- you know, are they supposed to read these that tells about history?  But, you wouldn't find it that way in the history books, would you?
R:  No.
L:  No.  It -- it might tell, but it wouldn't tell all of the gruesome details.
R:  Yeah.  I think they put -- probably should put that in there. [PAUSE]  Is that something that they call, you know, values?
L:  Okay, yeah.  I agree with that. [PAUSE]  Um, [PAUSE] okay, I'm running out of things to say on this topic. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] [PAUSE]
L:  Do you think the pub- -- ah, the private schools make the education better?  Do you think your sister got a better education than you did in public schools?
R:  I don't know.  She could've.  But, ah, she went on to get her Bach- -- she got a social work degree and stuff.  I didn't. You know, I went to trucking school, but I -- I liked other things, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I like, you know, scientific stuff, you know, now and stuff.  And I -- ah, I've read, ah, religious stuff, you know.  I read some, you know, twenty seven -- [MN] twenty six volumes of some religious stuff and it was -- it was pretty neat.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  I done that before, you know.  That's, like, four law degrees, you know. [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay.  I didn't know that.
R:  That's a lot of knowledge in those books.
L:  No -- no.
R:  [MN] [PAUSE] His- his- history too, where there's a lot of knowledge and stuff about a lot of things, so that's pretty neat. 
L:  [MN] I have to say, I don't really have a lot of that stuff. [PAUSE]  Um, did you see things that your sister was doing, like, in the Catholic school?  Was it that much different from what you were getting in public schools?
R:  Ah, well I don't -- I don't really remember that much, you know.  I kind of, you know -- I don't -- I don't even remember much about it.  But, it could have been.
L:  Do you remember her having a lot more work than you did?  Like, school wo- -- like, homework?
