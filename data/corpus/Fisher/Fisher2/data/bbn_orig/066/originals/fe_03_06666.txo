L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.  Who am I speaking to?
R:  [LAUGH].  Oh, my -- I'm Arlene Miller.
L:  Hi, Arlene.  I'm Sandy.  Where are you?
R:  I'm in, uh, Pokoto, Idaho.
L:  Oh, oh, I'm in Calgary, Alberto, Canada.
R:  In -- in Alberto, Canada?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].  
R:  You -- you're far away.
L:  I am.  
R:  So -- so what do you do?  Are you a stay home person?
L:  Yeah, I stay at home with my kids, yes.
R:  And how old are your kids?
L:  Um, five and two.  I have two boys.  So I actually get a lot of [LAUGH] exercise with them alone, you know, just chasing them around.  But I do work out on a regular basis as well.  Do you?
R:  Um, I'm trying.  I'm um not working right at the moment and --
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  -- um I'm having a hard time losing weight.  [COUGH].
L:  Oh. Oh, oh, oh.
R:  But I do feel better.  I try to walk --
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  -- at least a mile every morning.
L:  Wow.
R:  And I like it better in the morning because it's not so bright out and I'm allergic to the sun, so --
L:  Oh, that's funny, 'cause I like to walk at night.
R:  Oh well, I -- I --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- go with my husband at night sometimes, but he walks really, really fast and I can't --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- keep up with him and I'm trying to get my stamina up.
L:  Oh.
R:  So um it's better if I walk by myself, then I'm not racing to keep up with him, but I'm --
L:  [MN].
R:  -- I'm just improving as I go along.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, but we can talk more at night, so every once in a while, we go for a walk at night.
L:  Yeah.  I take my dog out with me at night 'cause he makes me go faster.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.  Okay.
L:  Yeah, 'cause --
R:  Yeah, I used to have a dog, but um, he died.  What --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  What else do you do besides --
L:  Um, I actually do -- I do light weights as well.  Like, I have a bench at home with um one pound, two pound, three pound and five pound weights, so I just do some really light free weights 'cause I find when you -- well, I find when you um have a little bit of muscle built up --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Sorry, my two year old's talking to me at the same time.  When you have a little bit of muscle built up as well, it helps -- you actually burn calories quicker.
R:  Oh, it builds your metabolism, right?
L:  It helps your metal-
R:  It helps boost -- you boost your metabolism so that the fat --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- burns?
L:  Burns more --
R:  You -- so if you -- you eat more, then it's easier to lose it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is that how it works?
L:  You know, I've -- I've been [NOISE] doing it consistently for about a year now, for -- okay, I'll be right back.  You pick one.  Sorry.  [LAUGH].
R:  That's okay.
L:  So it's the second I get on the phone, he -- he needs something.
R:  I know.  
L:  Just on the computer.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Um, yeah, I've -- for -- for about the last year I've been kind of consistent.  Every now and then I'll kind of fall off the wagon for a week or two, but I find the weights makes a huge difference.  Like, when I just doing cardio exercise --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it seemed a lot slower.  Now that I do both weights and cardio, I seem to eat way more than I used to, yet I've lost about seventeen pounds in the last year.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's wonderful.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  So, um, how -- 'cause I have some five pound weights.  I started --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- with a couple pounds, but I'm not [MN] I don't know that I am doing -- that I'm improving much with the weights.
L:  No?  So, the books that I buy, which I think you can get down in the States too, it's called Bodies for Life, uh, I'll tell you who it's by.  Bill Philips.
R:  Okay.
L:  And it -- it's a really good book.  It's a really good book.  It shows you all the exercises that you should do.  I don't follow it to a T, like it's --
R:  Mhm.  
L:  Like, I -- I'm still nursing when I start- nursing my son when I started it and it tells you, like, at each meal to eat a protein and a carbohydrate.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, and it tells you what are good ones to eat and what ones you should stay away from.  The part -- like, the nutrition part of it, I kinda follow, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't take supplements or anything, 'cause I'm just not big on --
R:  I don't -- I take calcium, I take, um --
L:  Yeah, I take calcium --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  -- and vitamins, but you know how you can --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- get, like, body building supplements that --
R:  No.
L:  -- help you -- like, I don't wanna bulk up.  I, you know, wanna --
R:  No.  And -- and it --
L:  I wanna be lean.
R:  And they're expensive and I can't afford --
L:  They are.
R:  -- all that, and I try to just eat right.  
L:  But just the exercises in this book I found to be really good.  As a --
R:  And he -- does it say that you need any more than, like, five pound weights?
L:  No.  No.  I -- if you want to get bulky, then you probably want -- would want to, but I haven't gone -- I have some other weights that I can change the -- the weight on --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I've gone up as high as fifteen pounds, but I find it's too much.  I start to get kind of bulkier than I want to be.
R:  Oh.
L:  You know, I still got a lo- I still got a long way to go.  I've still got about thirty pounds I want to lose.
R:  Okay, and have you lost, like, in your arms, the upper part of your arms, you know the flab underneath?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Have you?
L:  Yes.
R:  I'm -- I'm working on that.  You really have lost it?
L:  It's getting -- it's not gone --
R:  [COUGH].
L:  -- like I can still pinch an inch, an inch and a half there.
R:  Right.
L:  But it's a lot better.  It's a lot better.  And I just find overall, you know, like I mean, I don't expect to be a size seven again, but --
R:  No.
L:  -- um, I just want to feel a lot better and I can --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- keep up with my kids a lot better.  When I do fall off the wagon for a week or two, I'm tired and I'm grouchy --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it makes a huge difference.
R:  Yes.  Um, and it --
L:  And you don't have to -- you don't have to, you know, really tire yourself out, too.  Like, I find if I do weights in the morning, I have a lot of energy throughout the day.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  Than if I do -- like, at night time, I'm just not motivated to do the weights.  I like walking at night, but I'm not motivated to do weights at night.
R:  Oh, I like walking --
L:  [LAUGH] so -- 
R:  -- better in the morning and weights at night.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I have a bit --
L:  Oh, funny.
R:  -- of arthritis so it's --
L:  Oh, oh, oh.
R:  -- better if I am sort of warmed up during the day.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's better for me to do the weights at night, and um, I only do the five pounds with --
L:  Right.
R:  -- some of the -- like, the curls.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  And -- and some of those -- um, do you lift them over your head?
L:  I do the shoulder -- like, for my shoulder, um, I do -- I just go straight up.  Like, I -- 
R:  And how many pounds do you lift with that?
L:  Five.  Five in each hand.
R:  Oh.  Okay.
L:  Five in each hand.  I don't use uh, a big bar.
R:  No.
L:  I use individual hand weights.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I do have a big bar, but I haven't used it yet.  'Cause I just -- not so sure I want to get [LAUGH] quite that bulky.
R:  No.
L:  You know?  I'm uh, trying to get rid of the fat and not build too too much muscle, but I want definition.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, a bit of tone, but not -- nothing like a body builder or anything, cause --
R:  Right.  And do you find that it's helping your posture, too?
L:  You know what?  I been going to physiotherapy um because I have bursitis in my hips and they've --
R:  Oh.  Oh.
L:  -- taught me this exercise that is incredible for my posture.  It's to tighten your really deep, deep, deep abdominal muscles.
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  You know when you just do a normal crunch, where you're kind of just working your lower abdominals, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- this exercise that they've given me is you basically lay down and you kind of -- like, you know when you do a [inaudible], you know, the [inaudible] exercises?
R:  Mhm.  Yes.  
L:  Well, you lay down --
R:  [COUGH].
L:  -- flat and you kind of do a [inaudible] exercise.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, you breathe in, then you breathe all the air out --
R:  Right.
L:  -- do a [inaudible] and then it -- just as soon as you've got the [inaudible] engaged, suck your belly button in as deep as you can without --
R:  [MN].
L:  -- scrunching your butt cheeks or without letting your rib --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- cage go up, and it hurts, but it works so good, and since I've been doing that, I think my posture's improving.
R:  That is --
L:  'Cause then --
R:  -- strange how it would help your posture.  So you don't -- you don't --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- move anything but your -- your tummy button in?
L:  Yeah, you do like -- like a [inaudible] exercise --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and suck your tummy in --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and the first time I did it, I could only hold it, like, for two seconds.
R:  Okay.
L:  And it was, like, oh God this is hard.  Now I can hold it and breathe for about four to five minutes.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  I can ho- I can hold it in and breathe, and then if I'm driving along or something, like, when you're first learning how to do it, I practiced laying down, but then as I got better at it, I do it, like, when I'm driving and stuff.  I think about it and I try and practice it 'cause my back, I arch it too much.
R:  I do, too.  I -- I stand like a duck a lot and then --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I have lower um -- I have arthritis in my lower back so --
L:  Yeah, I have a bulging disc.
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  And so they say I've been arching it to overcompensate for that.  
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  And they need to kind of get me so that I'm not overarching in order to teach me the exercise for my hip.  [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.
L:  So it's all kinda coming together.  I've only been doing that -- well, I've been doing that, um, physiotherapy, for about four weeks now.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  But I've had to -- I've had to cut out lower body weights, but I can still do my upper body weights.
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  Yeah, 'cause they just don't want me to do squats or anything, 'cause that might set my hip off.
R:  Sure, yeah.  I don't do those either.  So how long are you supposed to hold that?
L:  Long as you can.  [LAUGH].  
R:  Oh, so --
L:  I hold it as long as I can.  Yeah, it -- um, my therapist said try and do it for five minutes, three to six times a day.  She said --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- three minimum.  If you can do it more, do it -- do it whenever you can think about it, 'cause she says that the -- the stronger those muscles are -- 'cause she says there's like four layers of muscle --
R:  Mhm.  
L:  -- in your stomach, and goes, and this gets like the really deep, deep, deep one.  The stronger those are, the better for my posture and then I can start working on the other exercises for my hip --
R:  So do you still do crunches? 
L:  No.  Not since she taught me this.  Actually, when I was there last week, she just taught me this new one.  You know the big body balls that you buy?
R:  Mhm.
L:  She just, um, taught me a new one where you lay with your back on the body ball and then kind of roll forwards just a little bit, so almost like you're in a sitting position.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know when you sit on a wall --
R:  Right.  
L:  -- how you sit and you squat down, the long kind of sit, sort of similar to that, but not quite as far down, and then just lift my head up about four inches and back down.  And that --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I can really feel as well.  
R:  I have been wanting to get one of those body balls.
L:  Oh, get one.  Get one.  They are great.  I love them.  They're --
R:  And do your kids play with them?
L:  Um, I put it kind of in a corner where they can't get it.  And they -- but they know they're not allowed to play with it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so they're pretty good.  They're pretty good.  A few times they've gotten it and, you know, I've said, "Leave that alone, that's mommy's.  You guys have enough toys as it is".  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  
L:  But they're -- they're pretty good.  Like, if I put it in a corner where they can't get it, then you know, out of sight, out of mind, but um --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- but when you do those --
