R:  Hello.
L:  [NOISE] Hi.
R:  Ah, my name is Roe[?].
L:  [NOISE] Yep.  This is Sandy.
R:  Sandy, nice to meet you.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, I'm -- this is my first call.  I don't know whether it's yours, or not.  I believe they said that, um --
L:  [NOISE] Yes, it's mine too. [LAUGH] 
R:  Ah, okay. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They -- I -- I believe the topic is do we feel that private schools have the right forbid students from reading certain --
L:  Books.
R:  -- books.
L:  Correct.  Yep.  Well, ah, [SIGH] I don't think so.  Do you?
R:  I don't see how they can actually.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  [NOISE] That's, you know, freedom -- our freedom, isn't it?  Freedom of, ah, you know, choice, right?
R:  Well, it's a freedom of choice, but [LAUGH] how would they know if you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- were a -- if -- if a student read a -- whatever on their own time.
L:  Mhm, exactly. [NOISE]  Right.  Yep. [NOISE] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, do you have kids -- do you have kids in school right now?
R:  No.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  Ah, [MN] they are all out of school, ah, since they are both --
L:  Mhm -- mhm.
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah.  I don't either, but, things have changed so much, [NOISE] you know. [NOISE]  So --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- in the last few years -- but, yeah, they -- you know, the schools try to control and do a lot of things and tell our kids things that, you know -- [SIGH] you know, they should do and stuff.  And I think they get too much involved, [NOISE] you know, in their personal lives --
R:  Well, I -- yeah.
L:  -- to a degree. [NOISE]
R:  I'm not that familiar with, um, what's going on now in private schools.  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, my wife and the kids and I, we all went to public schools, so --
L:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't have any experience with that, nor do I have any experience recently with, ah --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- the public schools -- they're outta college, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's not --
L:  Mine are grown too.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, I've got grown children and I've -- you know, grandkids and -- and, um, you know, I think [NOISE] that, ah, there's a certain limit to, you know, what they, you know, should be doing with the children.  I mean, teaching is one thing, but when they come -- you know, start telling them, you know, what they can do and what they can't do, I mean, it's gotten a little bit too involved, you know.
R:  Well, that sounds like we're, ah, of the same mind with that.  Um, I -- I'm not for many --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, in favor of many types, or really any types of censorship --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a- as far as, um, freedom of expression --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and -- and -- and what you want to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- avail yourself --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- as far as, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- any type of information.  I mean, as long as it's illegal --
L:  Mhm.  The parents should be monitoring their children -- [NOISE] and let, you know, their reading and stuff to -- you know, [NOISE] I mean, the -- the schools can suggest good books, you know, to read for, you know, um, their education.  But, I think that the parents should have the final decision, you know [NOISE] --
R:  Well, I --
L:  -- on what they read.
R:  -- I agree.  And, um, I think --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there should be more involvement, and there's[?] probably a lot more involvement in, ah, students in private schools.  Um, and it's probably [MN] more, um, needed in public schools.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  Ah, at least in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in the city it's definitely a case where it's needed.  Um, knowing that the people that I know that are in education -- the -- the teachers and the principals that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, I have family and friends that are educators.  It's, ah -- it's a lot different than we were in school. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Oh yeah -- [NOISE] oh yeah.  That's for sure -- that's for sure.  But, they never told us what we could read and what we couldn't read.
R:  No.
L:  [LAUGH] And we grew up okay. [LAUGH] 
R:  A- absolutely.  
L:  So --
R:  And I -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I -- I think it's a difference too in, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] what they actually have to read. [LAUGH]  You know, I mean --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in -- in -- at least in public schools, um, some of them --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- are lacking in -- in terms of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- materials, but I guess I'm --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- getting off the subject with respect to the private schools.  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- yeah, I think we're of the same mind.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  it's not a good --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- good idea for --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- them to even -- even attempt to, ah, I guess, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- limit --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- children in what it is that they can read.  They should be encouraged to read.  Um, and -- and as you said, with the, um -- um, I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I guess the structure --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- being given by their parents they would know what it is that they're looking at.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I'm not saying they should, as children, be able to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  --or -- or have access to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, I guess, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- more or less, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R: -- R rated materials and above.  But --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that's the parents' job --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- not the schools.
L:  Right.  Because what they do outside of school, [COUGH] that school really doesn't have any control over it anyway.  You know, it's the parents' job, you know. [NOISE]  So -- but, they can -- the schools can, you know, try to direct them to good reading material, [NOISE] you know.  But, they really, [NOISE] you know, [NOISE] -- really shouldn't have the final say in what, you know, the kids are, you know, reading.  The parents need to watch what they're reading, [NOISE] you know.  I think that sometimes schools get too involved [LAUGH] in kids w- -- you know, in things, [NOISE] you know, controlling with kids and stuff.  And, um, I don't know -- I think -- I think kids were better students and better [NOISE] -- you know, better children and had more respect for, you know, people, you know, years ago.  I don't know what's changed, but [NOISE] there's been a lot of, you know, things that have changed in the school system too. I mean, whether teaching kids [NOISE] -- like, the goals are bored[?] to extremes with things sometimes, you know, with kids. [NOISE]    
R:  Yeah, well, I think, ah, a lot of that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- comes from kids not being able to be kids.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm. 
R:  There's a lot of structure -- some of it coming from school, some of it coming from parents.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Ah, just in having time to do things that children did.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I mean, in -- in the sixties, growing up y- you did things.  There were --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, activities -- things --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that you had to do, but then you had time to just be a child.
L:  Mhm.  Right.  Yeah.  Think -- things were -- it was much more simpler life. [NOISE] You know, kids, I think, spend too much time, [NOISE] like, on, you know, computers and stuff like that.  Things that, you know, they're not really thinking -- using their minds with[?], you know.  Um, too many, um, you know, electronic games and -- and stuff like that. [NOISE]
R:  Ah, it's funny you mention computers, because I just finished work [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- even on a --       
L:  Well, really --
R:  -- holiday.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, they spend too much time on 'em, you know, really.  And -- and not being able to go out and, [NOISE] you know, play the games and stuff like we used to do and stuff, [NOISE] you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] Use their --use their minds to be creative and, you know, do things and sports and stuff.  You know, they're -- they sit too much, um, you know, [NOISE] playing those computers and little games on there, and -- and then those Game Boys and all that stuff.  You know, it's okay for a little while, but I think they spend too much time on 'em -- on those things.
R:  Well, I think those things are addictive.  I mean, I watch 'em  -- I watch nephews and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the -- the little ones with those things.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And maybe they should be re- -- allowed to read more --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because when they get those things, the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the little hand held, ah, games, all you see is their thumbs moving, and they can do that for God knows how long.
L:  Mhm.  You know, I think, um, you know, when we were kids, you know, they -- well, the school libraries only[?] they carry certain materials and stuff, you know.  And to a degree they do have -- you know they are able to control what kids read at school, [NOISE] you know.  But, the parents are gonna have to control it at home, you know, [NOISE] because -- and I don't know -- when -- when kids are little too -- I don't know if you remember those -- the -- those reader programs they used to have?  My Weekly Reader --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and stuff. 
R:  Oh my goodness.
L:  Yes.
R:  [LAUGH] Yes, the Weekly Readers.
L:  Yes -- yes.  And then, remember the book fairs?
R:  Mhm.
L:  They used to have book fairs and stuff, where kids could, you know, buy a -- books and stuff.
R:  Yes.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah -- yeah.  So, to a degree they do control, you know, what kids read and stuff, but, you know, they shouldn't, you know, [NOISE] be able to say, "Well, you can't read that" if they're reading something else. [NOISE]  The parents should have the final decision on that.
R:  Yeah.  Happen they should be encouraged --
L:  [NOISE]
R:   -- to read as much as possible.
L:  Yes, exactly -- exactly.  I know the libraries and stuff, you know, 'round here they, um, have a little -- awards and stuff for kids and that[?].  You know, like they get, you know, um, like, free meals at -- at Perkins or something like --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- that --
R: -- you [MN] --
L:  -- if they read --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- so much --
R:  What was it?  It was, um, ah, man, he was reading books on top of books -- Pizza Hut.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  They had Pizza Hut, and he would come home and read almost a whole book because for every book they got a personal pizza.
L:  Uh-huh.   That's good.  Yeah. [NOISE]  That's good.  And then, you know, I think -- I think kids, you know -- I think most of 'em, you know, read, you know, knowledgeable things and things that are good for them anyway, you --
