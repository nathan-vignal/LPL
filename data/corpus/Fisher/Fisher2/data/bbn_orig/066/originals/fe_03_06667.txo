L:  Hi, I'm Tasha.
R:  Hi, Tasha.  I'm Natalie.  How you doing today?
L:  I'm good.  [LAUGH].  
R:  Good.
L:  I'm still trying to get used to the format of these things.
R:  This is my second one.  Have you been --
L:  This is my second one, too, actually.
R:  Second one, too.  Well, I never -- fun, odd thing to do.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Um --
L:  Yeah, um -- 
R:  And now it's [inaudible] and do thing, talking about exercise.  Do you do it?
L:  You know what?  It's something I keep saying I'm going to do and I've been looking at a bunch of different gyms and I haven't done it yet.  And the sort of exercise that I do at home -- I mean, it's exercise, but you know, it's not the same as working out in a gym.
R:  No.
L:  What about you?
R:  I don't do any.  I just chase my kids.  Do you, um, do you actually do something, like -- like calisthenics?  
L:  Well, I have um -- I have all the firm tapes, all the firm workout tapes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I do the aerobics, and of course, I chase after my daughter too, but --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- I -- I don't think that counts [LAUGH].  
R:  [LAUGH].  I go --
L:  Neither does housework, although it burns the most calories.
R:  Does it?
L:  But um -- yeah.  Housework is supposed to burn a ton of calories.  It's actually supposed to be the best way to burn -- burn calories.  And then you know, there's house cleaning, then there's sex, then there's regular exercise and there's, you know, it -- it went through this whole list.  I saw it at my doctor's office once.  
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Well, boy, I don't even -- that should be encouraging, but I don't do any house cleaning either.
L:  Oh.  
R:  No, that's not really true, but I don't do much.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't do any more than I have to.  I don't get any enjoyment out of it.
L:  I don't either.  Which is probably why --
R:  I joined --
L:  -- I don't -- don't get any exercise.
R:  Right.  Yeah, that's -- that's tough.  I like taking yoga, but my son wouldn't stay in the um -- in the kids club in the gym.
L:  Oh, no.  
R:  Then I couldn't quite get the routine going.  I -- think when you have a routine and it's built in, you do it and then one cold or one trip or something and then I'll be derailed --
L:  And it messes you all up.
R:  -- for a month, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  And that's pretty much what happened to me, because I was exercising fairly regularly.  I was going out and running in the mornings and I would come home after work and just exercise, whether it was one of the tapes or you know, whatever it was, going back out to run with my daughter, but then I got bronchitis and couldn't do any of that and I just haven't been able to get back into it.  
R:  That's -- that's --
L:  And it --
R:  Yeah, you just get derailed. I so -- so know that.  You're all better now?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm better now, but it's been like a month and [LAUGH] and I still haven't --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- started exercising again.  And I keep saying, okay, today I'm going to do it when I get home and it doesn't happen, or today I'm going to go to the gym at work and I'll wake up and look at the time and think, argh, I don't want to get up yet.  I'll go back to sleep.
R:  I feel like when I'm -- not that I'm doing it now, but when I've done it, that the littlest steps would be helpful.  Like, if I got a gym bag ready at night, it --
L:  You know, that's not a bad idea.
R:  Like, and then even if I could -- even if I could only manage to get the exercise clothes on and exercise for ten minutes, I felt like that was better than saying, gee, I'm only going to have ten minutes, I'll -- I'll -- I won't do it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I won't bother.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just the -- just the exerci- the habit, the -- the practice of changing the clothes and you know  getting halfway there.  Even if you didn't actually exercise, I think would be on the way.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I try to tell myself, well, we have all these stairs in the house and I'll walk instead of drive, you know, to the store, something.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I don't do any serious exercise.
L:  Yeah.  I do that, too.  I walk before I drive and we have a ton of stairs in the building that I work in, and I'm constantly going up and down those.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I think you get the -- the little benefits.  They have a gym where you work, too?
L:  They do, but it's not in the same building.
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  And it's really difficult for me to get over there, because I'm -- I'm -- I'm a receptionist and so it's hard for me to leave --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because there's nobody to cover my desk for me.
R:  Right, right.  You're the one?
L:  Yeah, and the best times to go to exercise are during the day around lunchtime, but then that's generally when most people have their interviews scheduled, you know, because people are coming from other jobs, taking --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- their lunchtime to go on interviews, so it's kinda hard to get out then, and that would be the best time for me, ideally, but I haven't been able -- I haven't figured out a way to make it work out yet.
R:  Yeah, I think a lot of companies have gyms built in, and I -- I don't -- like, my -- where my husband works, they have one too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I -- I guess it's just such a -- it's such a kind of a mental obstacle to get out when people need you there,  and change clothes and then if you need to shower or, you know, get your hair wet again --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it -- I guess it just -- I guess it's not the -- it's not the easy task.
L:  Yeah.  I think, too, it helps when you have somebody to work out with.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause there's a girl that I used to work out with and we were -- I mean, we were -- we were really on it.  We would work out every Tuesday and Thursday and um -- in my building there's like a shower and all the other stuff and she would come over here at lunchtime and we would leave, we would go run around the park and then we would come back and just do some stretching stuff or you know, we would do, like, the firm has a -- the ab tape is roughly ten minutes long at the most.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So we would go run and come back and do that, or do that first and then go run.
R:  Do it at work?  Or in the --
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  There's a -- there's a room that you could do it?
L:  Yeah.  There's a big conference room towards the back of the building that isn't really used unless there are huge meetings happening --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it's got a VCR and projection TV and all the other stuff and we would use that one and just pop the tape in and work out, but she doesn't work here any more [LAUGH].
R:  Obviously you could find somebody else, but I don't know, if I got an invitation like that -- I work at home, so it wouldn't really count, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's like I would be so relieved if somebody came to me and had the idea and all I had to do was agree to do it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think I may need to do that.  I may just need to check out the bulletin board and say, "Look, I need some help".  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]. 
L:  I need to work out.
R:  Because everybody's in the same boat.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's true.   I didn't really think about it quite like that, but that's a good idea too.  
R:  I don't know.  I tell you, my most embarrassing thing is I drive my son to preschool, um, I don't know, six blocks.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And if I walked it, it would be pleasant for us both.  Maybe now the weather's nice, I'm going to try to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- work in that walk.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then walk home and do my work and walk back and pick him up and it's not -- it wouldn't be a serious workout, but it would be enough calories that would probably make a difference.
L:  Yeah.  And that would be cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I would really like to do that.  I wish that I could, but I don't work close enough by where my daughter goes to school to even consider that.
R:  Right.
L:  So.
R:  Also, if I could -- he's still young, that -- how old's your daughter?
L:  She just turned nine yesterday. 
R:  So she could skate or -- or do something physical and sort of keep up?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  If I take him to the park, he runs around.  I -- I can't run around like that, but I -- you know, I just chase him.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Or sit while he climbs or something.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I've been -- I've been thinking about, like, letting her ride her bike.  She loves riding her bike, and maybe just kind of running along with her.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Of course, she'd leave me behind.  
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] and have to come back, but I mean, that would still be at least regular exercise, 'cause she's on that bicycle every day.
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  So even if I only did it like three days a week for thirty minutes or so --
R:  Wouldn't it be fun, she could be your helper?
L:  That would be -- yeah.
R:  I bet she would love it, too.
L:  Yeah.  And she would help keep me on track.  She'd help me keep accountable.
R:  You would rather run than ride a bike?
L:  Well, if I had a bike, I would.
R:  Ah.
L:  Uh, that's yet another way -- I've thought about so many different ways I could be exercise [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  And I can't decide on which one and I -- I think because I can't decide, I still haven't gotten the kind of exercise I need.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  [SIGH].  So and I know I need it because I'm all crabby and blah.
R:  Yeah.  So like if I got in a good exercising thing, it would make me want to drink more water and less Coca Cola and it would have the chain effect, would -- would -- you know, the chain of events would be so good.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I would probably feel more rested ah -- you know.  And the calories and the body would be somewhere down that list, but not even the most important thing.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, it does have a lot of overall really good benefits.  I know when I am working out, I have so much more energy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I'm so energetic.  It doesn't matter what my daughter's doing, I can keep up.  You know, I'm not all out of breath.  I don't feel like I'm dying.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  Trying to run up and down the stairs, so and I -- I know it's much bet- it's good for me anyway, because high blood pressure runs in my family.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I know that exercise is a really good way of keeping it down.
R:  Right.
L:  And um monitoring it without having to get on blood pressure medication and -- or anything like that, and it's just overall good for your heart.  I just -- I just need to get my behind up and do it.
R:  It's just so hard.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I feel a little bit motivated.  I --
L:  Yeah, I'm -- this -- I've gotten some really good ideas, too, from you.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  From like just -- just talking about it.  Maybe that's just what I needed to do, sit down and talk to somebody about how I can get my exercise in  [LAUGH].  
R:  In a positive way and then --
L:  Yeah.
R:  My sister said yesterday, and she doesn't have any kids and she just doesn't -- she has a lot of freedom.
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  She says, you know, join a gym.  It's on my list.  It's been on my list for months.  It's so stupid.  It would take half an hour.
L:  Mm.  Yeah.  
R:  Wha- what is this doing on my --
