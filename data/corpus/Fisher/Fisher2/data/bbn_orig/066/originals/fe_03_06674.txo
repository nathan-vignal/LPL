L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi. [LAUGH] 
R:  Hi.
L:  This is Susan.
R:  Uh, my name's Cassandra.
L:  Hi, Cassandra.
R:  And this is my first time, so --
L:  Oh, mine too [LAUGH] so I --
R:  Oh, is it?
L:  -- really don't know what to do, but [SIGH] I guess the topic is supposed to be health and fitness or something?
R:  Yes, if we exercise to, I guess, better --
L:  Yeah, [SIGH] um --
R:  -- [MN] you know --
L:  Yeah, [SIGH] well --
R:  -- our h- to make our health better.  So, do you exercise?
L:  [SIGH] Um, yeah, probably not as regularly as I should, but, you know, I'm guilty, I guess it's because I -- [SIGH] you know, I work so much and I -- long hours and by the time you get home and [SIGH] you pick up the house, or you do this or do that, you know, then it's getting to be nighttime and you know, [LAUGH] it starts all over again.
R:  Right, [SIGH] yeah, I, um, I don't think s- well, I try to do -- we do, like, family walks or family bike rides or -- [SIGH] but to exercise by myself, I, um, it [MN] -- like you said I -- it doesn't seem like there's enough time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um I don't work, I stay at home, but I have a Brownie troop [SIGH] --
L:  Oh, gosh.
R:  -- and, you know, and then I do college part time and that takes up -- I mean I spend most of my time on the computer writing papers or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, doing some kind of homework and then when they come home then I have to help them with homework and --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- you know, and like you said, there's laundry and there's the house to clean and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- then dinner and -- we try -- we try to do our bike rides, [SIGH] um, or our walks right after dinner.
L:  Yeah, [SIGH] it --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- that sounds like about us, usually try and take, like, a walk.  I haven't -- you know, my -- I only have one child and she's twenty two, but she still --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [LAUGH] she still lives at home. But you know what I'm saying, it's like by the time that you do what you have to do and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, usually I -- you know, I have to work, um, [LIPSMACK] uh, [MN]  twice a week at my store till five thirty and then two more days till five, and then one I have to work till nine thirty, so it's like, [SIGH] to come home after working from, [SIGH] you know, like, eight thirty to, you know, by the time you walk in the door, five thirty, six o'clock or sometimes later depending on if you have to run to the store for something, it's like [SIGH] tha- that's one [LAUGH] thing not on my mind.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.
R:  I mean, I would like to exercise regularly, I -- [SIGH] if I had time to fit it somewhere in there, I have two exercise machines, but they're out in the shed 'cause my -- we moved and my house isn't big enough to keep 'em --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in here.  So, I used to do those but now we're in a smaller house and, [MN] you know, I just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] and going to the gym I just can't see myself going [LAUGH] there, you know.
L:  Yeah, well, that's [MN] -- we've been paying for membership and it's, like, [LAUGH] "Okay, well, we'll go". [LAUGH] You might, you know, used the treadmill for a few minutes or, [SIGH] you know, my husband likes to swim a lot, so they have a big indoor pool and I'm not, like, really a swimmer but, [SIGH] you know, I'll go in and get my feet wet, but it's [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- like, "Man, [LAUGH] you know, no, no, I guess not" you know but, uh, [SIGH] go and say, "Well I'm going to go the gym for an hour and work out" [LAUGH] that's not me. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  That's -- I don't -- I just don't feel comfortable in front of people, you know, running or -- [SIGH] or doing -- you know, if I did the machine wrong, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they -- they would be laughing at me, [LAUGH] you know, it's like --
L:  I -- I know, [SIGH] because we used to have, like, a membership at the, um -- the Y.M.C.A. --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- you know, it was, [SIGH] you know, both, you know, men and women could go but it's like, uh, you know, you got all these body builders in there --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they're looking at you like, "Well why are you here?" and it's like [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] So I -- so I know I didn't feel comfortable, there's a lot of times I would just [SIGH] use something small and then just walk out or something, you know what I'm saying?  Just because --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it wasn't comfortable.
R:  [SIGH] Well, we, um, I'm -- we're in Alaska, I don't know where you're at, but --
L:  Oh, my god, Alaska?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, Michigan. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] So --
L:  [LAUGH] Kind of a different part of the world. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, the -- the winters are long here, I don't know if they are there but, [SIGH] you know --
L:  Act-
R:  -- we have nine months of winter and only --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- three months of summer.
L:  Oh, my gosh, yeah.
R:  So, I mean, exercise [LAUGH] is three months of the --
L:  Yeah, you're inside quite a bit, you know --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, we don't -- [SIGH] and -- and I can tell, this is only my second year up here and I've put on a good ten pounds since we moved here [SIGH] just for that fact.
L:  Yeah.
R:  In the winter, you know, all there is to do is kinda veg in the house. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I g- yeah.
R:  You know, and get that boredom eating and [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, oh, I know, [LAUGH] I know, 'cause [SIGH] I can be guilty of it too.  If it's my day off or something and I just don't feel like doing it. [LAUGH] So, I know.
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  But, no, it's finally -- it's starting to get a little bit nicer here to be able to do a few [NOISE] things [NOISE] but [SIGH] it's still kinda cold, even going into June, it's still, you know, like, it -- only in the sixties.
R:  Yeah, that's how it is here.
L:  Oh.
R:  I think it was fifty six today, but it's, like, so windy and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, we won't be able to take a walk tonight, it'll blow us away today.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  But, you know --
L:  Oh, well --
R:  -- my kids get plenty of exercise.  Well, we have a trampoline in the back yard.
L:  Oh, gosh, yeah, I bet they love that.
R:  Yeah, and w- it has the safety --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- net around it, so --
L:  Oh, that's cool. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, that's the only way we would get it, but that's where they -- as soon as, you know, it starts getting warm, the trampoline comes up and my kids are on it, [SIGH] you know, constantly --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and I keep telling myself, "I need to get out there and just jump with 'em --"
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  "-- for a little bit" 'cause it is a lot of exercise. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I've been on it a couple of times and I'm like, "Oh, my gosh". [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I --
R:  I can't believe it, you know, just jumping up and down takes up that much --
L:  [LAUGH] [MN] Energy --
R:  -- of your energy.
L:  -- and that. [LAUGH] 
R:  But it does.  But they're on it all the time and, [SIGH] um, my husband, he's in the military and he just failed his, um -- they have to do a bike test --
L:  Oh, gee.
R:  -- and he's failed it twice now --
L:  Oh. [SIGH] 
R:  -- so he's real big into the exercise right now cause he's [LAUGH] in trouble. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 'Cause you have to pass it. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, gosh.
R:  So, he's -- every night he'll -- my son, he's fourteen, they -- like, yesterday, they went on a bike ride up in the mountains and got lost --
L:  [SIGH] Oh.
R:  -- and they were gone for, like, forty five minutes and they were exhausted [SIGH] --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- by the time they got home, but they definitely got their exercise.  So, he's either trying to run [SIGH] or ride, um, every day [NOISE] because --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- he has to take the test again in a week [NOISE] and [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, my god.
R:  So, he -- he's trying. [NOISE] 
L:  Is it -- is it, like, a really strenuous test or something, or ?
R:  No, he's in pretty good shape, I mean, he -- he -- he's not in a bad shape.  We try to eat pretty good and, like I said, we do our walks and stuff, it's not like he's in --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] really bad shape, but the new test they do now, you get on this bike and it goes by your heart rate --
L:  Oh, god.
R:  -- and he can't seem to keep the heart rate the way it's supposed to be to pass the test.
L:  Oh, jeeze.
R:  So, it, you know -- but he really i- he really isn't in bad shape --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean, they still have mandatory P.T. on Thursdays, [SIGH] so, you know, he runs on Thursdays and has no problem running for miles --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- but, I mean, he ran track all through high school and, I mean, he was -- he's [MN] very athletic in that way.  I mean, to look at him, you know, he's not a big man, he's not [SIGH] -- you know, he looks fit --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but he -- [SIGH] the test was just kind of -- I don't think it really truly shows -- a lot of guys that get on there, they smoke and drink and all this stuff --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and they can pass it, but [SIGH] the healthy ones seem to be failing it.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  [SIGH] Could have had something -- you know, you have to -- the heart rate has to be steady for so long and then have to work it up and it has to be to a higher level and if it skips or does anything wrong you just -- it messes everything up.
L:  Oh, jeeze.
R:  So.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  I don't know, you know [SIGH] -- I [SIGH] -- I don't think it really shows if he's, you know, fit or not.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They used to make 'em run, you know, a mile and a half --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that used to be the test --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and if you couldn't make the one and a half mile run [SIGH] then you failed, and he can do that.  He can make the -- the -- the running part easily.
L:  Oh, jeeze.
R:  But I guess people were dying on the run and stuff, so they --
L:  Oh, but nothing like getting the heart going fast. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] You know. [LAUGH] 
L:  So, [LAUGH] they had to change it over to this bike riding thing [NOISE] but --
R:  Oh, my god.
L:  -- if they would [NOISE] just do it [NOISE] on the treadmill, [NOISE] you know, they could monitor [NOISE] their heart that way.
R:  Right, yeah, almost like a stress test or something.
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] So, you know, 'cause that's what they're worried about, is, [SIGH] you know, somebody keeling over form their heart -- heart rate being up to high.
R:  Oh, jeeze.
L:  So, they, you know, changed everything. [LIPSMACK] Are you still there?
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] I'm still here, no [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] Ok- I --
R:  I'm just listening.
L:  [LAUGH] It was just quiet there for a second, I was like, "Uh-oh, did I lose her?"
R:  No, [LAUGH] no, but --
L:  So, if you could exercise, [NOISE] what kind of exercise would you want to do?
R:  [SIGH] What I would really like to get into would probably be, like, yoga.
L:  Yoga?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think that's interesting, I have a friend that does it and she's been doing it forever [SIGH] and she's just totally fit, she loves it, it's not, you know -- [SIGH] it's not high impacts or any of that stuff and everything.
R:  See, that's why I think I'd like it is because it looks like it tones you but it would relax you at the same time and it's like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, in today's -- you know, I -- I don't -- I'm sure with everybody there's so much stress and everything, and for me, myself, it would be [SIGH] almost like a -- just a good stress reliever, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- 'cause it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [MN] I find, like, half the time I can't -- you know, I don't sleep good and I'm thinking, "Well, maybe that would be a good thing to try and it's "  I've got the tapes [LAUGH] but I haven't [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, do you?
R:  -- often [inaudible]. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I have tapes too, but they don't come out either.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I have a whole gym and then I have, like, and easy glider thing that's --
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  -- and -- but like I said, there's no room.
L:  Yeah, it's hard.
R:  I h- [SIGH] you know, to have that --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- big old -- 'cause I mean it was out in the garage but that didn't work either.  Who wants to be out in the garage to [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  -- to exercise?  So, [SIGH] um, I like the -- have you seen the big balls that they use?
L:  Yeah, I haven't -- [NOISE] I haven't, [NOISE] um, tried it, but I've seen it, [NOISE] you know, I [NOISE] --
R:  I -- I heard those are really good, [SIGH] and I -- the -- I think that's what I would like to do if I had to do -- [SIGH] but they say you're supposed to do something, too, for your heart --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- though.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, you're supposed to get your heart up so many --
