R:  Hi, my name is Terry.
L:  Hi, this is Jewel[?].
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  I'm good, how are you doing tonight?
R:  Good, um.  So, censorship, huh?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I -- I couldn't be further opposed to censorship if I tried.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, --
L:  Oh.
R:  I don't think anybody has the right to tell kids what they can and can't read, it's art.
L:  Hm.  Um, what field do you work in?
R:  Um, well, I'm a social worker, --
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  -- and I'm an -- also an actress. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Wh- why, why do you laugh?
L:  No, I was just wondering if you were in a very liberal field or not.
R:  Are you?
L:  [MN] 
R:  What -- what's your field?
L:  I'm, I'm, I'm a dancer, and, um, and a writer.  So I'm -- I'm on the same board as you, you know?
R:  Oh, okay, good.
L:  Um, --
R:  I immediately started feeling myself get defensive.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Um, yeah, no, where are you -- where are you from?
L:  Um, I live in New York now.
R:  Oh, I'm in New York too.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  You're in New York City?
L:  Yeah!
R:  Oh, my God, so am I.
L:  [MN] Wow! [LAUGH]
R:  This is the first person I've talked to in the study that's from New York City. [SIGH]
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Um, so, --
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, --
R:  Um, so yeah, so I -- I -- I -- I'm so against censorship, I think it's horrible, I think it's -- I think it's all in the eyes of the beholder what gets censored and what doesn't, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think, especially, schools don't have the right.  I mean, like, what are we going to do, start burning books next?
L:  Right, right, um, have you ever, ah, like, been in a situation where something's been censored, you know, like, in a school system or something where they -- they wouldn't allow you to read something, or anything like that?
R:  Yeah, I mean, I'm a -- I've been a -- a teaching artist before, and, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, you know, as a teaching artist we were not allowed to do certain songs, like, musical theater songs in certain schools, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they, you know, they would feel like it was too risky, or they didn't -- you know.  There was a song, it was -- it's called the Pirate Song, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, they didn't like it -- it because it talks about stealing, and, it's, like, it's a -- a song about pirates, for goodness's sake.  Like, it's not condoning stealing, it's -- it's a fantasy makeup song, like, it's -- it was just ridiculous.  I thought it was over the top.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  To say the least.  What about -- how about
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you?  Anything that's been censored for you?
L:  [COUGH] Um, I can't think of a specific moment, but I did grow up in the South, and, um, there, there's not so much, like, they never come out and blatantly say, "Hey, we're censoring this", but I do -- my mom was a school teacher, and I do know that they're very, um, [inaudible] you know, they're very, like, ah, oppos-, um, imposing, that they say, "Oh, you really should be -- do this", and if you bring up any other suggestions that are outside their box of what they think is good, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- th- they don't even, like, listen to you, you know.  Like, and, it's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- really so conservative down there, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that, um, they -- they're not thinking about the education.  I mean, they're not thinking about how to make children smarter, better, whatever, they're --
R:  Right.
L:  -- i- it's really just that they're playing by the rules, and they're trying to get by, you know.  Which is crazy, because that's -- that's not what education's supposed to be, you know.
R:  Right, I had a friend -- I had a friend -- my roommate's friend was here from Detroit, and she was talking about how hard it was for her even -- get books for a black history month --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- in her -- in -- in her school, it was, like, "We just don't have it on the curriculum", --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, like, I mean, what you choose to omit is a form of censorship too, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's not just what you decide you can have, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's what you say, "Oh, we don't have the money to buy", it's what you don't include --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in history books, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I mean, as much as anything else.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?
L:  And it's also, um, like, I know they'd always have approved lists, like, these books are approved and they're not saying you can't teach anything else, but they're saying, "These are the ones that are easy, these are the ones we recommend, blah blah blah blah blah", but, you know, it made it very hard if it wasn't on that list, you know, like, that's a form of censorship on its own, --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- that they're saying, "We like these twenty six things, and we, you know, we're going to give you a hard time if it's anything but these things", you know.
R:  Exactly, I mean, --
L:  Um, --
R:  Yeah, I -- I -- I just -- I find it so ridiculous, and I don't know if you saw Bowling for Columbine, but --
L:  I haven't.
R:  -- I was just thinking about that when they said censorship, because I was thinking about, like, you know, music censorship, and Marilyn Manson, and all this stuff,  like this idea that, like, music pollutes kids' minds and makes people want to kill people or shoot people in Columbine and, all this stuff and, it's, like, nobody wants to look at the kind of world we live in, and the Government that we have, and, like, the leaders of this country who drop bombs on countries indiscriminately, and how that might teach violence.  Why can't that teach violence as much as anything else?
L:  Right. That's a pretty good --
R:  I mean, Marilyn Manson is listened to in other countries, and they're not shooting each other in school.
L:  Uh-huh. Yeah, I think that it's, it's -- you know, which is a big theme in America, it's always about trying to make things look good on the outside, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and never -- you know, like, they're, they're not teaching people how to be parents, they're not doing anything about that, they're not making the education system good, but if they say, hey, we -- we want to let you play Eminem in school, then, you know, they're protecting your children and they're teaching your children right or wrong, you know.
R:  And how, how is that helping any, I mean, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, this whole thing about music, this rap music, is, like, it's always something, you know, it's always something that's, like, destroying our -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if it's not Catcher in the Rye, it's, like, Eminem, you know, --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- it's -- and [MN] there's -- there's so many other things that we could look at in our country that are --are -- are shortcomings, that -- in -- in our world, that lead to violence, [MN] you know, that promote violence, or, you know, just TV and, like, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, the news, like, you know, just -- and, and -- if we get it watching -- watching the police officers in, in, in New York City deal with, um, with people on the streets, like, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that's vi- -- that's violent to me, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, listening to Dialo[?] and Luima[?], that's violent to me, that makes me, -- you know, why, why is that any different than listening to a Tupac[?] song talking about what he sees in his neighborhood, you know?
L:  Right.  I think people are just afraid to, I mean, like you said, admit, you know, what's -- what's going on and what isn't going on, and just always trying to find a scapegoat, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, you know, politically and moneywise, it's like, if it -- if it makes us look good, then it doesn't really matter what we're doing, or what's going on?
R:  Right.
L:  You know, we want to get voted into office, which means that we want to make you think that your children are safe, which means we're going to do whatever we can do to make it look like that, regardless if it's true or not.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, so, um, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, it's, like, a -- you know, and it's really weird, I'm -- I've -- I've never really lived for a long period of time in another country, but, um, I'm wondering, if, you know, like, you see this cycle happening, and it's obviously a very American thing, but I'm wondering, like, if -- if it's completely opposite somewhere else, or just a different, you know, way of life, or whatever, where, um, you know, instead of censoring everything and always being so superficial, that they're always, kind of, dealing with the core, and then they have issues on that side as well, you know?
R:  Well, there's just definitely not this kind of censorship in Europe, I mean, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I -- I -- I can't speak to other countries, and I feel badly about that, I feel like it's so Euro centric, but I-I only know that Europe is not like that, --  
L:  Right.
R:  -- there's a lot less censorship, and there's also a lot less deaths, and crime, and -- like, there's a lot less of everything --
L:  Right.
R:  -- caught up [inaudible], you know, bad, in those -- in those countries, where there's so much less censorship, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it's like, if you really want to censor something, censor it with your -- with your dollar, I mean, you know, your dollar --
L:  Right.
R:  -- is your vote in a capitalistic society, so, if you don't like something, don't give your money to it.
L:  Right, that's so true.
R:  And if you censor something on a big scale, you just make people -- call more attention to it, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like, if you really don't like Marilyn Manson, don't ban him, because, if you do, like, everyone's going to buy him.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Just don't -- don't -- just don't spend your money on Marilyn Manson, --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's how you can censor him.  Your -- you know, that's how you can keep him --
L:  Right.
R:  -- from making money.
L:  Well, I think, it's always -- you always want what y-you can't have, you know?  So if you're telling kids, like, "Oh, you can't have this, you can't do this, you can't do that", you know, that's what -- when -- that's what makes them want to do it, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  And it's -- it's not solving anything, and it's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- not teaching them anything, it's just making the urge bigger, and, you know, [MN] it's not hard to get things in this country, so, [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they're going to get it one way or another, and, you know, it- it's not serving any purpose, there --
R:  And, you know, there's always rebellious youth.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, like, in every country.  It's not like we have the corner market on rebellious youth because we have all this violent --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- rap music! You know, it's, like, there's -- there's rebellious youth in every country, you know, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there -- there -- it's just part of be a teenager and feeling misunderstood, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- going through the whole, like, painful time, of being young and -- and, not understanding, you know, what's happening in your body, and everything, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, so I don't know, I just think it's all so silly, it's very silly, you know?  There's always a new thing that's like, the new bad thing of the week and after --
L:  Oh, always.
R:  -- Columbine, it was [MN], it was, um, it was Marilyn Manson, and, you know, there's always something, you know?
L:  Right, right.
R:  And the ironic thing is, like, now with everything, you know, we're fighting for freedom in Iraq, and, you know, it's funny, because [MN] if we're so free, why are, why are we even having this conversation about censorship?
L:  Yeah --
R:  I mean --
L:  Yeah, that's a good point.
R:  -- you know, 'cause they say that, like, "Oh, why did the people bomb the Trade Center?"  Well, because they're so jealous of our freedoms.  If they're so jealous of our freedoms, why aren't we able to say and do and listen to what we like?
L:  Mhm.
R:  How, how, how are we, you know, I mean, in some small way, we are oppressed, you know, i- in different ways than, I mean, than the women wearing burqas, you know, it's, like, it's different, but w- we get oppressed by this sort of you can't say this,  you can't wear, you know, you can't listen to that view, you know, even the news, the news, what's on the news is like censorship, like, we don't see everything that's going on.
L:  No, we definitely see the, ah, you know, the -- the white businessmen's version of everything! [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, that's another thing they say about textbooks and stuff, like, I know there was a big, um, big to do in, like, the -- the late seventies or the eighties, that, um, like, a lot of the Native American things and, then, also, even as far back as the slavery things --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, they were totally misinterpreted and they're, you know, and they're in textbooks which are all over the nation, which, like, we're raising the entire n- next culture on, you know? [MN]
