R:  Um, I work out in a gym.  When I do go, it's about an hour.

R:  Mhm.
L:  So, it -- it takes time for me to get over there and, um --

R:  Oh, that's cool. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [NOISE] That sounds like fun.
L:  Yeah, mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] I usually ride the [NOISE] exercise bike for about [NOISE] twenty minutes [SIGH] and [NOISE] I do sit ups and I do weight lifting. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh. [NOISE] 
R:  And [NOISE] that's pretty much it. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But I don't do it regularly anymore.
L:  Mhm, oh, okay.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Um, I was going to, um -- I went out to the gym today [NOISE] [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [NOISE] hello?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [MN] But I don't know which is -- do you know any gyms?
R:  [NOISE] Any gyms?  
L:  Uh-huh. [NOISE] 
R:  Well, um, I'm at a college [NOISE] and so we have a gym in our dorm hall --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- so it's just right downstairs and there's, like, four or five gyms on campus, so 
L:  Oh, where is that?
R:  Where is it at?
L:  Mhm.
R:  UCLA. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, You're at California?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  Where are you at?
L:  I'm in New York City, I to go to, um, um, college in [inaudible].
R:  Oh, okay. [NOISE] Wow, we're really far away from each other. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- [inaudible].
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- well, other than that, um, [SIGH] I do work out most of the time, but, I don't know.
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] I would like to do it every day, but, [NOISE] like, when I'm stressed out about school, I just -- or I've had [NOISE] too much -- too much homework then I tend to [NOISE] --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- not exercise [NOISE] that day. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] But  [NOISE] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well.
R:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] Um. [SIGH] 
L:  Uh, [NOISE] [MN] 
R:  Why do you work out?  Just --
L:  I -- I don't need to but, like, I just -- I do 'cause my friends they -- they usually work out.
R:  Oh, okay. [NOISE] 
L:  Um, [NOISE] I -- I go with them --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and we work out and stuff.
R:  Mm. [NOISE] 
L:  Um, my mother, she's a little overweight, so I think I go with her to work out.
R:  Hm. [NOISE] 
L:  And it's really fun.  I don't know nothing though. [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] But the college I said I'm going to, um, they usually -- they usually have, like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they -- they should have a gym --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  -- where I can work out, so.
R:  They do have one?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, that's cool.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE] [SIGH] I like to, um, play tennis too, for a workout.
L:  Oh, oh, play tennis?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh.
R:  Like, [NOISE] once or twice a week for about an hour to two hours.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] 'Cause it's [NOISE] -- it's easier when it's [NOISE] something fun [NOISE] you know, like, a game, [NOISE] instead of just, you know, working out.
L:  Yeah.  My boyfriend, he's a, um, +instructor.  He's a fitness disgu- um, +instructor.
R:  [NOISE] Really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  That must be a fun job.
L:  Yeah, [MN] he's enjoy -- he enjoys it.
R:  [NOISE] Have you always had, um, [NOISE] a physical workout, [NOISE] um, plan, you know, like, your whole life, or recently, or ? [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah, mhm.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
R:  Pretty much your whole life?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, when I was still in high school --
L:  Are you?
R:  -- I played -- no, I'm in college now, but when I was still in high school I played a lot of sports, so [SIGH] [NOISE] back then it was easy, but now it's hard [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to do it on your own.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [MN] Hm.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I -- I used to cheer, like, cheerleading --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  -- so I know I'm not about, like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- say and hour and everything --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- even with cheerleading --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it seems cool --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, you go workout and stuff and not, you know, get too, too sweaty --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  -- but you try to -- you know, you try to work out --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- for the team, so the team will look good --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  -- type of thing. [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, it's important to be fit, especially for [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah, we --
R:  -- that sort of thing.
L:  Yeah, when you our age, you -- you know, and trying to stay healthy.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Mm. [LIPSMACK] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  A lot of people, they come to the, um -- the fitness room, my -- my, um -- my -- what's that?  [SIGH] My ex boy -- my boyfriend work at and they work out all over.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [inaudible] there's a pile of other people come --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so 
R:  I don't really like going to fitness places 'cause I don't like to [LAUGH] work out in front of a lot of people. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, oh.
R:  I kinda like to go by myself.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] Do you have any kind of, like, nutritional things that you do to help you when you're working out?
L:  No, no.  I really -- well, um, my boyfriend, he usually does the -- [SIGH] like, I mean, he's -- I mean, he don't tell me what to eat or whatever, [SIGH] but, like, he'd tell me, like, oh, this is good and what's not good --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- type of thing. [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] But, I mean, he went to school for, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- fitness and working out and everything --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- so I listen to him.  He had books he reads, so --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I read 'em sometimes.
R:  [LIPSMACK] That must be nice to have somebody who knows all about that kind of thing.
L:  Yeah, mhm. [NOISE] All that kind of thing. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, I didn't hardly know anything about that sort of thing [NOISE] until I came to [NOISE] UCLA [NOISE] and they're concerned about [NOISE] people when they work out because, like, a lot of, you know, college students want to look perfect, so they kind of go overboard.
L:  Mhm. [LAUGH] 
R:  So, it's like a big [NOISE] -- kind of one of the big things here.
L:  Yeah, yeah. [LIPSMACK] 
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  Hm.  A -- a lot of people say that when we work out is better -- it's much better when you work out when you're younger --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because we -- when we are older it's -- I mean, you -- you end up not doing it, like my mother.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, she kinda likes to work out.  She's, like, forty, so she's a little old --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [MN] to work out.
R:  Yeah, plus, if you start early then it's easier to stay in that habit for your whole life.
L:  Mhm, yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah, I wish I would have kept on going since high school, but I took, like, a year break and then it was really hard to get back on.
L:  Yeah, me too, I took a year break too before I go to con- [inaudible] I'll probably try and make the team's roll.  You ever heard of school?
R:  What?
L:  You ever heard of this school?
R:  Uh-uh, I never heard of it.
L:  Oh, okay, it's a two year course.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, I don't know really of anything over there, I've never been --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- to the east coast, so 
L:  So, you lived in the west coast a -- a long time?
R:  Yeah, my whole life, actually, I've lived in California.
L:  Oh. [SIGH] Mm.
R:  So  [NOISE] 
L:  How many degrees is out there now? [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, it's, like, I don't know.
L:  [MN] 
R:  It's really hot, though, I know that. [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm. [LAUGH] [MN] 
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] Which makes it even harder to exercise, then. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, mhm, that's true. [MN] 
R:  [SIGH] So, you pretty much just exercise 'cause your friends do, and your family?
L:  Yeah, [LIPSMACK] that's fun.  I don't know, I guess it's harder by myself. [inaudible] money with me.
R:  [NOISE] For motivation, or --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- for fun? [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, definitely motivation and some type of fun.  Depends.  'cause I always change my mind a lot.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, maybe I'm crazy, rah, rah. [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  'Cause they're saying, "Now you should go". And I say, "Well, go"  and so I go and I'm like, "No, I won't do it".
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  And so --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  And now I'm working out --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- about, uh, every other day.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, around here it's hard to get, um, like, your friends to work out with you 'cause everybody has such different schedules. [NOISE] 
L:  --Mhm.
R:  So it's hard to match up for you all together, so [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [NOISE] that's why I think most people just go by themselves around here. [NOISE] 
L:  Wow, okay.
R:  [NOISE]
