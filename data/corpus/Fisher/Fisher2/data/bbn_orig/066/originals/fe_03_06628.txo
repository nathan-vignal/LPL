L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi. Um, --
R:  How are you doing?
L:  Not too bad, --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- how are you?
R:  Good.
L:  Yeah, the weather's bad where I am. [LAUGH]
R:  What's that?
L:  The weather's really bad.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  So we're supposed to talk about censorship?
R:  Okay, censorship.
L:  Um, in public schools?
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, what's your opinion on that, what's your take?
R:  Censorship, ah, for books and stuff?
L:  Well, I suppose all forms of media?
R:  All forms of media?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, if it's, like, bad, like, um, I don't know, like, anything to have to do with sex or anything, I should think -- I think they should censor it, but if it's, like, good media, it's okay, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I guess.
L:  Well, but, I mean, okay, let's say, censorship usually applies to sex and violence, --
R:  Uh-huh, sex and violence, you got to -- you got to choose your words, you know what I'm saying, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if you're dealing with children.  That's how I think of it.
L:  Well, but, I mean, above what age and, you know, --
R:  Kind- -- 
L:  -- below what age, do you know what I mean?
R:  Kindergarteners, you should -- kindergarteners, you should be careful in choosing your words.  You shouldn't be showing them graphic stuff, and, -- that's how I feel about it.  And violence.
L:  Yeah, but this is for public schools, --
R:  But --
L:  -- public schools, so what -- around what age would that be?
R:  Public schools, it depends, you're talking about middle school, elementary, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah. Like [inaudible]
L:  And there's high school, too, isn't there?
R:  -- and there's high school too, but, you know, if you're dealing with, like, elementary school, you got to -- to be -- you [MN] got to be more considerate on what you're going to choose, you know,  for graphic, and the words you're going to choose.
L:  Mhm, mhm, but, well -- the thing is, I don't know, in some societies, um, is it, it seems pretty normal, part and parcel, to, ah, be open about sex at least, it's, it's, you know, um, --
R:  Oh, yeah, like, health education.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  Like health class, yeah.  That's norm- -- that's normal, yeah.
L:  Yeah, so I mean --
R:  But when they -- when they show films like -- they -- they take it too far, I think, sometimes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- with, like, violence, and -- kids don't need to see the violence of guns and stuff, --
L:  -- Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- that's how I feel.  Yeah.
L:  No.
R:  -- but, I mean, normal health education is fine, 'cause they're going to --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they're going to find out about it sooner or later.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, but if you don't, um, if you censor it from kids, don't you find that they would be more curious, and try and find out on their own?
R:  Yeah, that's how I'm thinking, yeah, too, mhm.  'Cause they're going to find out from either their friends, their --
L:  Yeah, exactly, or --
R:  -- friends, peer pressure from their friends.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or older brothers and sisters --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- older cousins, --
R:  Yep, or their parents, or parents' friends.
L:  Yeah, and, they might be curious, and try to experiment on their own, with- --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, without knowing what to do and what not to do.
R:  Mhm, that's true.
L:  So, I think that can be, um, that can be detrimental as well, c- -- you know, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so it really depends, I mean, when I was really young, I watched Faces of Death, but it didn't affect me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  But, I mean, some kids it does, when I was young, I watched this one horror film, and -- and -- and I still have dreams about it now.  It -- it affects some kids.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  Yeah, it was about monsters and stuff, and I still remember it, and I was only, like, five or six years old.
L:  Really?
R:  So it -- yeah, it depends on the children.
L:  Were your parents with you when you watched it?
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Yep.
L:  So they were, but you're still --
R:  And I -- I -- I begged to watch it, and then -- and then, to this day, I still remember it, these little -- little monsters coming out of the chimney.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, so, I still remember it.  So it depends on, the -- the child, I guess.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  Yeah, that's what I think.  So --
L:  Well, but, the problem is, the parent won't know what affects the child and what doesn't.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  You know, so, i- it's kind of tough, and the school, I mean, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- is it really up to schools to, --
R:  Yeah, but --
L:   you know, censor things?
R:  -- yeah, I don't know, but the parents should have a part in it too, you know, 'cause there's a lot of stuff on TV, like horror movies and violence, and blood, and guts, I mean, I wouldn't let children see, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I wouldn't let them see, because I mean, you know, they're going to find out about it later, but why let -- why let them find about it when they're young and confuse them, they don't know much about it, you know.
L:  Right, but what if you explain it to them?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you think that works?
R:  Ah, like, if they're, like, five or six year olds -- s- six years old, they're, like, confused and stuff, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't think it's going to work, I mean, why is this person shooting each other and, why -- you know, and they don't even know the meaning of death, or anything, you know, they're confused and everything.
L:  Well, what age do you think would be a reasonable age for --
R:  Probably around -- I don't know, probably around twelve or thirteen years old, to see violence, I think.
L:  Mhm --
R:  But --
L:  -- and how about sex?
R:  At -- [LAUGH] nowadays, --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I don't know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, exactly, you know.
R:  Yeah, nowadays, they're like thirteen, fourteen years old.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and they seem to know about it, you know, even if you --
R:  They seem to know about it more than you do. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, exactly, probably.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh, exactly.
L:  Yeah, me, I had a friend who taught, uh, thirteen year olds, and she --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- said that "They were all perverted!" [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah?  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  They find out about all of it more than you do, and then, when you went to school.
L:  Yes.  Exactly, you know, --
R:  Yeah, so -- 
L:  So, I don't know, the thing is, prob- -- I think they should be educated about it, um, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because I think it's kind of inescapable that they learn about it, there's an internet.  There's everything on internet.
R:  Oh, yeah, the internet.  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  That's another source where they can get stuff.
L:  Exactly, so, --
R:  I don't --
R:  Technology is advancing nowadays, and that's, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's more, they can get more information from the internet, and television, the radio, everywhere.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  Yeah, and it's -- it's kind of difficult to -- to -- to censor that for --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- young children, you know?
R:  Yeah, true.
L:  Um, especially the internet.
R:  Yeah, it is.
L:  You know, --
R:  I mean, they got parental locks and stuff, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  So.  
L:  Well, it doesn't always work.
R:  Yeah, it doesn't.  No. 
L:  Yeah, they can always borrow, like, tapes, or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- magazines, from cousins, brothers, they'll steal it --
R:  Yeah, and they can always go [several inaudible words] 
L:  Yeah, I mean, I went, wh- when I was ten, me and my friends would go to, um, my friend's dad's drawers just to, like, look for this porn [inaudible] that he hide -- he hid somewhere.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  He hid it away, you know, but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- my friend found it, and we're, like, "Yeah, what's that all about?"  [LAUGH] You know?
R:  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah.  
L:  The more we're not allowed, I think, when we're young, the more curious.
R:  Yeah, I think --
L:  So --
R:  -- so too, yeah.
L:  It's --
R:  I feel that way too.
L:  -- it's a difficult line to draw.
R:  Yeah, it is a difficult line to draw, --
L:  Yeah, --
R:  -- 'cause they're going to find out about it sooner or later, I think.
L:  Y- yeah, exactly, so I think, probably, parents should explain to kids okay, like, if you do come across material like that, do understand that, ah, you know, this is this, this, or something, you know, --
R:  Yeah, explain it to 'em, like, for instance, dr- -- for instance, drugs, you know, -- 
L:  -- Mhm.
R:  -- they're talking about drugs, and, you know, you should explain to your kids about that too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  'Cause they're going to run into it sooner or later.
L:  Yeah, exactly, and I'd rather them -- uh, tell them, you know, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if you get to know these things, tell me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, we'll talk about it, you know. 
R:  Yeah, it helps to talk about it, yeah.
L:  Yeah, if you're curious, well, let me explain it to you, because I think, you know, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I -- I'm the best person, I'm not going to lie to you, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I think you can tell your kid that. 
R:  If they can come to you, you know, and all, then they'll feel better.
L:  Yeah, if -- if they don't feel that they can -- they can come to you, they'll go to someone else, or they'll just -- 
R:  Go to someone else for information, the other person might not be better, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] yeah, exactly, or, you know, they might just, you know, try to find out on their own.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So that's not really good.  So, I mean, but, if you have kids would -- would you let them, you know, watch or read anything to do with sex or violence?
R:  Ah, it depends.  I don't think I'd let 'em -- rated R, if -- it depends on their age, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean, like, rated R, like violence, violence, like, shoot- -- and guts, and stuff like that, I don't think so.
L:  Mm.
R:  But, like, m- movies that are PG and stuff, yeah, I'd let 'em watch that, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but, rated R, I don't think I'd let them do that, no.
L:  [LAUGH] well, how are you going to stop them, that's the thing.
R:  No, I mean, when they get a little -- I have little kids.
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  -- but, you know, when they get older, yeah, but -- I try to limit it, but, you know, to the violence and the guts and stuff, I don't want them to see that.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  Yeah, mhm.
L:  It's really 'cause you don't want them to be traumatized, more than anything else.
R:  Yeah, I don't want them to be traumatized at a young age, because, sooner or later, they're going to see it.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  You know.
L:  They will be traumatized later on.  [LAUGH]
R:  Now, the video games they have out [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- for, you know, like, Playstation Two, and stuff?
L:  Mhm, Mhm.
R:  Those are, those are really bad, too, so how can you censor, when they're selling video games, with, like, fighting, and, you know, violence vid- -- violence video games?
L:  Mhm.
R:  They're doing --
L:  Actually, they're more for older, um, older children, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- rather than young kids, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I believe, --
R:  Mhm. 
L:  You know, 'cause, they're for adults as well.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, but, I mean, do you think, if a teacher, um, would teach material on, like, sex education and all that, do you think you would -- as a parent, you approve of that, or?
R:  Yeah, I would approve of it.  So --
L:  If it's -- if it's being taught properly, I think, you know, --
R:  If it's being taught by a professional -- [MN] like, a teacher and stuff, I would approve of it, yeah.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  -- because that's their job, and I -- I know, they do it right, you know, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I know they're not being perverted about it, or anything, they're doing it professionally.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  Yeah, and it's better to learn that way than any other way.
L:  Yeah, exactly, that's true, you know, --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- better to learn from your friends, or, -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- over the internet! [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So, but, um, what do you think of the school -- the current school system, do you think they censor enough?
R:  Yeah, I don't know, sometimes, sometimes not.  I think -- I think they do, though.  I'm pretty sure they do.  I don't --
L:  Right.  So you're think- -- you -- you think that they're doing, um, a decent, uh, a decent job?
R:  I think so.  Yeah, that's what I think.
L:  Well, I -- I guess I -- I guess
