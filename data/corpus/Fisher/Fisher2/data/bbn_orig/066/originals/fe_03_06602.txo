L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello? 
L:  Hello this is Joanne in Christmas City California.
R:  Wow this is Beth Davidson and I'm in Southeast Georgia, just North of Florida. 
L:  Oh, wow we are really spanning the United States, aren't we?
R:  Completely we -- um, are completely on the other side of the country we're right -- we're at the coast. .
L:  Yeah listen I didn't quite understand what the topic today was, did you? 
R:  We're talking about censorship whether schools should, um, censor what books their children are allowed to read.
L:  Oh.  
R:  And keep certain things out of the library.
L:  Oh, well that -- that I do about but I didn't know they were going to do it in schools also.
R:  Right well that's -- that's what they are talking about censorship from what I understood it was from your children's books and things like that.
L:  Oh, right. 
R:  For instance do they have the right to keep Harry Potter out of the library?
L:  Well for heaven sakes [LAUGH] somebody's crazy.  I am [COUGH] a great big advocate of the library and I think -- you know I think everything should be in the library, in fact I have pulled out some books that I was very surprised was in the library.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well I -- our school has a program -- I'm a teacher.
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  And our school has a program called accelerator reader.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  And, um, and  -- there was a book I think it's called Who's -- Where's Rabbit -- Who's Rabbit -- Rabbit something or rather --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but it was a very much an adult book and the F word was in the first page [LAUGH] it was very very much an adult book I was a whole bunch of accelerator reader [inaudible] and the teachers were also in a competition the more books we read we could win a forty dollar gift certificates throughout the dinner.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well I read the Rabbit book and it was really really bad.  It had -- it talked and this was in elementary school.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it talked about whenever he saw different women at the airport what he thought he might like to do to them.
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  I had that book pulled from the shelf.  Now if that censorship I just could not you know in elementary kid opening that book and seeing some of the things this gentleman had to say.
L:  Well yeah that's true but I -- the only thing I could think of is that you pull it from the shelf and only give it to the student if he requested it you know that's you know he has apparently if he -- if he would request it he apparently would know what was in it.
R:  Well --
L:  And not many --
R:  Well that one had too much adult content in it.
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  For an elementary child in my opinion.
L:  Yeah well I could say he wouldn't request it unless he knew what was in it.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right but see now would a parent know that a child was requesting that kind of adult book.
L:  Well I'm sure he wouldn't because I don't think they talk books with their parents.
R:  Right.
L:  I don't know.
R:  And I think that that one might be too -- I in order to protect your kids I don't mind censoring that out of our library because I don't think the kids should run into it thinking they're going to get a lot of points from this.
L:  Yeah well I was thinking mostly of the library we're coming from two different ways.
R:  Right and I'm thinking when I was in high school I graduated in seventy five and they were -- the parents were trying to get certain books taken out of our libraries and of course now high school is a little different than elementary school too and they wanted certain things taken out and they protested and we ended up having bomb threats we were -- it was absolutely ridiculous.  We were outside as much as we were inside from part of the while because we were threatened so much and the protesters were out there with signs that weren't even spelt correctly.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  And it was like they want to censor these books out of our library and they can't even spell.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's pretty good.
R:  They don't even know what I'm supposed to be reading.
L:  Yeah I --
R:  And I thought that was crazy.
L:  Oh, yeah I was having this discussion about censorship with a lady yesterday and what I didn't understand was that they want to -- the Federal Government can come in to the library and request all of the books that you have checked out and I didn't know this was happening.
R:  Oh.  
L:  Yeah it's something to do with homeland security.
R:  Oh, well you know what I guess that's not a bad thing I guess the --
L:  I don't know.
R:  -- FBI knows a lot about us, don't they?
L:  Yeah I know but -- I -- they would be bored if they figured out what I checked out.
R:  I would think that they'd go more the other way.  I would think that they would pick something like bomb making type of books --
L:  Oh, sure.  
R:  And say I would like to know who has checked out an extraordinary number of books related to chemistry, bomb making and so forth and, um, maybe even may have to do with security in airports or something of that nature but what ever I can understand that if somebody has a tendency they've been checking out a lot of things like that then perhaps they've got somebody with bomb making and it may not be a terrorist.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It may be a teenager thinking they're going to do something pretty cool in their high school.
L:  Yeah -- yeah well it have to -- have the fellow either be the suspect first because in the library they don't keep track of books that way they just keep track of who checked them out not what type they check out.
R:  I won- -- I wonder if they're going be required to put in a new kind of software so that they can.
L:  It would be.
R:  Track books that way.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And see if there's a pattern.
L:  Yeah that's true and I -- did you -- what was the name of that book, um, not the book -- the picture about and uh, [inaudible] the two reporters I can't figure the name of it where they were the [inaudible] break in and they were -- the two reporters who were --
R:  I know who you are talking about with the [inaudible]
L:  Yeah -- yeah that's it -- the two reporters were in the library a congress looking up, um, what -- they're suspect was -- had checked out and they were going through all of the call tickets and what I really liked about that one scene was that it focused on the two guys doing it and then it drew back and -- to the dome you know the dome in the Library of Congress.
R:  Right.
L:  It was a beautiful scene [inaudible] because it was pulling back to it and I felt like I was sitting up there watching them.  It was really good.
R:  [inaudible] That movie all of the Presidents were in it.
L:  Yeah that's it -- yeah.
R:  Yeah I have a copy of that.  I will have to go back -- I have got watched that for [inaudible] --
L:  It's a -- yeah I don't know who they were -- were investigating but they're -- the scene is where they are sitting at the desks at the library of congress checking out who checked out what book.
R:  Right.
L:  And I always enjoy that -- that one.
R:  Yes well I'm sure that if a book -- particular book popped up a number or type of books that popped up that would probably be best in our security interest the way things have gone now.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It isn't safe any more you know.
R:  Yeah I had no idea and as a matter of fact that may -- they may put in some kind of software that triggers you know a watch on somebody's account. 
L:  Yeah the only thing is that I don't know some of the public libraries are, um, in doubt in other words they're not really public they're libraries that had been in doubt by the money and I don't know whether the board of directors or what could -- would do it but it would have to pass a law that it was mandatory to have it done.
R:  Right but I'm guessing in the interest of you with all that's happening in our schools and things I guess that's some interest of the children's safety, I can't imagine they would say that [inaudible] if the Government provided it how they couldn't say put it in.
L:  Oh, sure.
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  Yeah but I -- 
R:  Everybody worries about you know Government being the next Columbine or something.
L:  Yeah that's right.
R:  And like you know of course going off in different tangents I think that all of the advertising of the Columbine College was actually the worst part -- worst thing they could do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because you know there's a lot of troubled kids and those kids who are thinking well I was going to commit suicide anyway I think I'll be famous and take out everybody in my school with me like the Columbine kids.
L:  Yeah but they don't stick around to be famous they're either in jail --
R:  But they weren't -- they weren't going to stick around anyway.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So if they were going to commit suicide they may as well to it big and be famous for it and everybody remember my name at least.
L:  Well that's true I guess that's.
R:  So as I said I think the media really over did that to where like I said if a kid is troubled anyway and a lot of children are.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That they think well I'm going to go out any way I may as well go out and everybody remember me.
L:  Yeah well I think -- I blame the media for a lot of excess stuff that goes on.
R:  Right.
L:  And they just won't let things alone.
R:  Right that's maybe that part of censorship maybe that's part of not being censored.
L:  Well they -- they have stories that really don't make any difference, they're just -- they have either newspaper or a thirty minute call -- a thirty minute program that they have to fill up --
R:  Right.
L:  -- with information and so they're likely to pick up anything and go with it.
R:  Right.
L:  That's the way I feel.
R:  Well I don't know I guess censorship in general is somewhat advancing.  We had a, um, sent our, um, -- I don't city [inaudible] who just got [inaudible]
L:  Oh, really?
R:  It wasn't the same thing because apparently he made some very lewd remarks to the city manager --
L:  Well for heaven sakes.
R:  -- and she resigned and they -- they wouldn't let him speak in any council meetings for the rest of the month.
L:  Well for heaven sakes.
R:  Actually had an investigation and found out just what he was saying and it -- it was, um, some sort of prejudice, biased nature or sexual thing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when all he had said was -- and so he wasn't allowed to speak and I was like I had never in our local government had never heard of any of our people being censored [LAUGH] so that was really something.
L:  Well it was probably very inappropriate remark that he made.
R:  Well I'm sure it was.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Sometimes they just get mad and it just comes right out of their mouth and you know I don't know maybe he -- maybe he's the type of guy with he gets
