R:  Roqvieta[?] Gilligan.
L:  Roquette?
R:  Yes. 
L:  Hello. 
R:  Roqvieta. Mhm.
L:  How do you do?  I'm Katie Gruber.
R:  Okay.  
L:  Nice to meet you.
R:  Okay.
L:  W- Where are you calling from?
R:  Ah, Charlotte, North Carolina.
L:  Uh-huh.  I'm in Chicago.
R:  Okay.  
L:  What's your stance on, uh, whether public or private schools, um, what was the phrase, um, have the right to --
R:  Of censorship of books.  
L:  Yeah, to prohibit their students from reading certain materials.
R:  I agree.
L:  Y- -- um, for both schools?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yes, I do.
L:  And, ah, why do you think so?
R:  Well, I believe there are books out there that children shouldn't be reading, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because I think it, ah, causes them, they read things in books and they think that they can do them, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they want to follow suit when they get older, eighteen years old, I thought, even sixteen years old, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if they decide to read them, then they can read them.  But until they're mature enough to separate fact from fantasy, no.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That's the way, --
L:  Yeah. [MN]
R:  -- how I feel about it.
L:  That's a good point.  Um, I agree with a lot of what you're saying, um, but [MN] one thing that worries, me, though, is that -- who is going to make up the list of what books should be, ah, prohibited?
R:  I think it should be, you know, when a school starts making up a book list, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- right, that children read, that they should have parents participate in it.
L:  Mhm.  I agree.
R:  You know, I think, you know, more parent participation, parent or guardian or whatever participation.
L:  Right, and that way it can really be kind of locally determined, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and based on, the kind of -- actually, even cultural values of a region, because actually, a book that in one part of the country might seem very controversial might not be [MN] seen as such in another part of the country.
R:  Right, right, well, that's -- you know, I feel that they have a right to say no, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, this book is not proper for you, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah,  then if a parent feels, if they decide, oh, well, that book is proper, well, I think the parent should be able, be authorized to be able to say, "No, I don't want my child reading that book.
L:  I agree.
R:  This is the book that I want my child to read", and not have the teacher say, "Well, you know, you got to read my book".
L:  That's a good point, and another is that, um, certainly, if a -- if a certain book is, you know, the majority of the parents say that the book is, let's say, not appropriate for, you know, this age group, if a p- parent feels strongly, you know, he or she can certainly buy the book and, you know, give it to the kid at home.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, but I agree that, under the school, um, roof, you know, there's this notion that the school really is supposed to be making decisions about what -- what goes on in those classrooms, so --
R:  Well, I -- I feel that parents have given schools --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- too much authority.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I feel that they've given them too much authority.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Ah, they have to participate. I have a granddaughter in private school --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and one of us is there at least once a week, --
L:  They're doing what?
R:  -- at the school, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- we're there at the school, monitoring classes, --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- being a class parent, a classroom parent, --
L:  Really?
R:  Ah, --
L:  I've never heard of a classroom parent.
R:  Well, that's a parent that comes in and helps and assists with the teacher.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, I am the adopted grandmother of the class.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, you know, when I walk in the door, grandma!
L:  Oh, [LAUGH] uh-huh.
R:  You know, but, you know, I mean, uh, we haven't had any problem with the books, because she goes to a religious, ah, private school, --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and we haven't had, you know, too much problem, there were some parents that did not like the idea that they were studying about dinosaurs, but once the teacher sat down and explained to them why they were doing dinosaurs, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it wasn't a problem.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I think, you know, it should be more parent teacher communication, I don't think there's enough.
L:  That's a good point.  Uh-huh, I think probably all schools could benefit from that.
R:  Uh, --
L:  Um, certain, -- you know, when you think, though, [MN] I guess one thing that worries me is that books like, um, you know, Huckleberry Finn, or To Kill a Mockingbird, that I think today most people would agree, a- agree, are -- you know, just have so much wisdom about life and humanity, um, but in certain places, those books were viewed as, --
R:  Right, as derogatory.
L:  Right.
R:  Well, like I say, and another thing, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there are books out there that maybe I don't particularly like, but I think would be beneficial --
L:  Right, that's a good --
R:  -- for my granddaughter to read, though when she's reading them, I'd be sure that either her or her mother or her father or her grandfather, somebody else, has reviewed it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so that when she asks questions, we can properly --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- answer the questions.
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, you know, you just don't give a child a book and say, here, go read!
L:  That's right.
R:  You need to know what's in that book.
L:  That's right, yeah, I agree, although I think most --I think the vast majority of parents do not know what all their kids are reading.
R:  No, they don't, they -- they have, th- they don't know, they don't know, well, my child got a book to do, got to do a book report, and they can't even work with the child and kind of, --
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- I mean, the child should be doing the book report, but the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- parent should have --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, should know what they're doing, you know?
L:  Yeah, I agree.
R:  Just like, right now, my daughter is doing her end of grade, um, report, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- which includes English, History, and a couple other subjects, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I looked at it and said, "Oh, that's a lot!" until my daughter said, "Well, Mom, this is what she's been doing all year".
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so, she went through, well, she's, I was, "Oh, well, she can do it".
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So we went on the computer today, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and she got some of the information that she needs, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, --
L:  What grade is your granddaughter in?
R:  Third grade.
L:  Oh.
R:  Third grade, -- and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they have to do a report on the State of North Carolina, they had to know what -- what -- what -- ah, they nee- -- had to name three states that's in the Piedmont, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- three states that's in the middle of the country, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and the coastal states.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, she went on the computer, and, you know, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- her and I worked on it together.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, that's a good model, I think, of how -- y- -- how it should be.  [LAUGH] I -- I've -- I worry, though, that -- I don't have any children myself, but I worry that that is far from reality for most children.
R:  Well --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I put it like this, I have a, I basically, within my house, I have what they -- I call, a homework center --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I work with four or five other kids --
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  -- doing the same thing, the parents claim they don't have time, but, put it like that, [inaudible] when my kids came up, I had made time.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And, -- but most people expect the school to do it.
L:  I agree.
R:  And it's not the school's responsibility.
L:  Right.
R:  You have to take some responsibility.  
L:  Right.
R:  If my child was not learning, I can't blame that teacher.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I have to take some responsibility for that.
L:  Uh-huh, yeah, I know what you mean.  Huh, well, um, is there is book, a per- -- like, a book that you think -- you think of as kind of controversial that you think should, would -- you would vote for it not to be censored?  But you think that some other people might vote for it to be censored?
R:  Yeah, Harry Potter.
L:  Oh, and would you be -- I haven't actually read the Harry P- Potter books.
R:  Well, I have -- I haven't read the total book, but I've -- you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, right now my daught- -- granddaughter has no interest in it, because she's seen clips of it on TV --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and she didn't like it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But I think, because there's a lot of stuff in there, that to me, it just -- you know, I mean, like, the little boy --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that had read Harry Potter and thought that he could get on a broomstick and fly away.  And he got up on a counter top with a broom stick and hurt himself.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Things like this.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Separating fact from reality.
L:  Right.
R:  Fact from fantasy, and, like I say, he didn't know any better.  He's seen it on television, he figured, "Oh, yeah, I can do that [inaudible]".
L:  Uh-huh.  Well, I mean, to be the Devil's Advocate, uh, [MN] kids -- of course I don't have children, that's really probably coloring my idea, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- sometimes, I think, you know, kids learn by trying things out, and certainly, I don't want anybody to stand on a roof, but, um, you know, maybe jumping off of a -- as long as the child didn't get, you know, terribly hurt, but --
R:  Right.  Well, just like one of my younger sons, right?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- he went to see, uh, Mary Poppins when he was young.
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and he thought he could jump off the railings.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  But, I didn't take him, someone else had taken him and didn't explain, "So, hey, that's fantasy".
L:  Yeah.
R:  He jumped off the porch with the umbrella and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- stuck the umbrella in his eye.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And so, you know, that's when I started to realise that you got to explain things to children.
L:  That's right.
R:  Hey, this is a great movie, I like it, I enjoy it, but --
L:  Yeah.  Right.
R:  -- that's not reality.  You cannot -- you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's a good point.  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, that is, that is where a lot of this stuff became reality to me.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I never paid it no mind, but, -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, so, he has a spot in his eye where he will  have, I mean, he's forty seven years old now, but he still has that spot where it's like blind spot in his eye.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And he was only about six -- six or seven when he did it.
L:  Oh, gee.
R:  And [MN] sure, I believe that people should try things, but, at the same time they have to be cautioned.
L:  Well, y- --
R:  That could be dangerous, you know.
L:  That's right, and you -- I never really thought about explaining something to a kid --
R:  Right, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that can be dangerous.
