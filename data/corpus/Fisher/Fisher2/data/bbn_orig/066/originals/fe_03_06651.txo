L:  Hello.
R:  Hi. 
L:  Hi.  My name's Becky.
R:  Hi.  My name's Pat.
L:  Ah --
R:  And I do exercise, try to every day.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Just walking.
L:  Mhm.  Excellent.  How many times a week do you walk?
R:  Mm, pretty much every day --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- unless it's just absolutely pouring rain.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Um, sometimes I'll go in the rain, but you know, just got to be light stuff
L:  Mhm.
R:  And walk anywhere from two to four miles.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We have a one mile route, um, and there's a bunch of people that live close to me that like to go, so we --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- call one another and say, "Hey, can you go?"
L:  Right.
R:  And --
L:  Are they mostly women?
R:  Yes.
L:  That's cool.
R:  Sometimes my husband'll go with me.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  He -- he likes to go at night, like, especially in the summer time after it's cooled off.
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  He doesn't care if it's dark.
L:  Right.
R:  But um, we have seen snakes on the road, so the women are a little more leery about going --
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  -- at night.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Well, I work out at Curves three times a week.
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, I just started that this past March.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it's been great.  I just -- I love it.  It's -- it's -- do you know what that place is?
R:  I've heard of it, but I don't know much about it.
L:  Yeah, it's a -- it's a little circuit training place.  It's just for women and it's -- it's -- they basically just have a circle of um hydraulic machines --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and everybody goes around the circle and there's music playing and there's a recording that will tell you when to move to the next machine.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And you spend thirty seconds on each machine, um, and then it'll say, you know, go to the next station, and you go to the next one.  Everyone just kinda does round robin, going round and round the circle, and it's designed so that you get half an hour.  Um, it's thirty seconds on each machine and in half an hour, you've had a full circuit workout.
R:  Oh.
L:  And so because it's half an hour, and I think -- I live in a really urban area, um, you know, tons of women are doing this because it's so fast.  And you get every muscle in your body worked out and it's very high paced and it's very -- it's taught fast paced and it's fun and there's other women there to talk to and because it's all women, you don't feel like you're being sized up by guys, like at the club.
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  And it's just -- it's really -- I think it's -- and it's cheap.  It's only thirty dollars a month.
R:  What has it done, like, to your weight?  Have you lost weight?
L:  Yeah.  Well, I actually -- this past Christmas, I got really, really sick.  I -- I got stomach ulcers.  I'm in med school and so my stress level has just been off the chart and I got stomach ulcers over the holidays and I got really sick and I couldn't eat, and I love to eat, and um -- I -- I was about twenty pounds overweight so as horrible as stomach ulcers are, it was kind of a blessing 'cause it -- I -- it forced me to lose weight.  [LAUGH].
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  And it forced me to eat a lot less and I lost over the holidays, between the holidays and about, I don't know, beginning of March, I lost a good thirty pounds anyway, just from that.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  So I just -- I couldn't eat at all.  Hardly anything.  And um then just 'cause that -- I was so depressed from all of that, you know, my friends were, like, "You need to exercise every day.  That's really gonna help get you back in shape, it's gonna help your depression levels" so I joined Curves and I think, instead of the weight that I lost from being sick, I think Curves is just getting your heart rate up that -- a couple times a week like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And working out a little bit every muscle in your body.  The thing I've noticed most of all is sleep.  I sleep so much better.
R:  Yes.
L:  'Cause it's like I wore myself out a little bit, you know what I mean?
R:  [COUGH].  Um --
L:  And so --
R:  -- we've noticed that, because um, like last night, my -- we had the windows open and um it rained.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I didn't hear it.  My husband was talking about we got more rain overnight and I said, "I didn't hear it" and he says, "Well, I heard it and it rained hard" and -- but I had gone and worked -- I had gone and walked two miles last night, about eight or eight thirty, and I didn't hear a thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I just slept right through it.
L:  Wow.
R:  And usually I hear everything.
L:  It's amazing what a difference just -- that exercise can make, just in sleep.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  And that was the first --
R:  Well, I want to lose a little --
L:  -- thing I noticed.
R:  -- bit of the weight, too.
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  Um, I've lost a little, but I want to lose some more.
L:  Right.
R:  And I think this is just needs to be an ongoing thing.  
L:  Right.
R:  So with the stomach ulcers, could you not eat anything?
L:  Um, I -- for about two months I subsisted on, uh, cold plain tofu, apple sauce and I don't know, some -- sometimes bananas, and that was about it, for a good two months.  That's all I could eat.
R:  [inaudible].
L:  And it was just -- it was like eating like baby food.  It was just horrible.
R:  Did you eat -- as -- as much as you wanted of those things?
L:  No.  God, no.  I could only handle, you know, small -- about six small servings of those things a day.
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  And that was about it.  Sometimes crackers, sometimes soup.  It would -- I just had to, like, trial and error my way through it and it was just, um, you know, it's not the thing I would wish on anybody, and it was the last thing I expected to happen.  I mean, I'm -- I'm pretty young, I'm only twenty eight and --
R:  Did they give you some medicine for it?
L:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, they ended up having to do surgery.  I had to have --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- emergency, I had to have an endoscopic surgery and I've been on meds now since -- since it all happened.
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  I'm still on meds now, but I'm able to eat now, which has been great and uh --
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  -- it's kinda dangerous, 'cause like I hadn't eaten for so long, that when my appetite came back and I knew I was able to eat and it was safe, I've just been eating like a pig, which everybody is, like, "Good.  Good.  Eat", but I'm like, "No".
R:  No, you don't want --
L:  I've lost all this weight and I still feel -- I -- I like, you know -- and the thing that's most annoying and I thought I would never, ever complain about this; none of my clothes fit me any more.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've lost too much of the weight and I am just amazed that how -- you know, it's just sounds so, like [inaudible] you know, like "Oh, you know, I'm -- you know, I'm a size eight now" and like I used to be like a thirteen, fourteen, and like, it's just -- you know, oh, I have to -- oh, my clothes don't fit me and it's like, I don't know, I used to, like, hate women that would complain about them, like, "Shut up" but now I'm totally doing it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So it's just -- it's been interesting, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But --
R:  Well, you'd be smart if you would watch what you eat now and maintain this weight.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So that you don't --
L:  And --
R:  -- ever have to go in -- through, like, something like this again.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I don't know, exercise and stuff, I just -- I think there's too much focus on weight loss.  I don't think that should be the focus.  I think it should be on whether or not you feel good.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you're healthy.
R:  Well, it definitely makes me feel good --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- whenever I go and exercise.
L:  If your blood pressure's good --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you're healthy and you're strong and your triglycerides are low, you're good.  I wouldn't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- worry about the weight.
R:  Well --
L:  Weight, weight, weight.  It's all about weight.
R:  -- my --
L:  I think it should be --
R:  -- my --
L:  -- more about --
R:  -- cholesterol, all that stuff, great.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, my husband's isn't, but his is hereditary, but he has found something to take care of it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And um, but I -- I do feel better whenever I have the weight down.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I -- I don't need to lose much, but I need to lose, you know, a good ten, fifteen pounds. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, just I don't know, it makes me feel better whenever I do it.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And when I get it back down this time, I -- I think -- well, I'm over fifty --
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  -- so I think this has got to be a constant thing.  Um, it can't just go crazy every day, eating.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think something happens after you turn fifty --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and you gotta just watch things and it's not like you're denying yourself everything.  Like, strawberries are in here right now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We're getting fresh strawberries, and I have been eating them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I've been eating them with my uh -- with that cream cheese dip --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that has the -- oh, um, the marshmallow cream in it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I love that, but I just haven't been eating a lot of it, but I haven't denied myself having that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because that's -- it -- it'll just be right now and once the strawberries are gone, that's it.
L:  Mhm.  I'm also a believer in good appetite means good character.  I really am.  You know?  So I'm all for eating, but it's like, you know, if you exercise enough, you shouldn't have to worry about what you eat, you know?
R:  Yeah. 
L:  I mean, as long as you're not eating, like, five Macs a day or something [LAUGH] like that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know?
R:  Right.
L:  So, yeah, it's -- it's been a -- it's been a long -- it's been a long, interesting journey.  I don't know --
R:  Now, how --
L:  -- about a year ago at this time, I was weighed about one hundred and eighty five and I'm about five four.  
R:  Okay.
L:  And I weight a hundred and forty two now. 
R:  All right.  I'm --
L:  And so it's just --
R:  -- five four and a half and I weigh a hundred and fifty right now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  A couple months ago, I weighed as high as a hundred and fifty six.  That's -- and I've lost six pounds very slowly.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's very slow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And um, just you know, taking it easy --
L:  But that sounds like you're in pretty good shape, if you're over fifty.  I mean, that sounds fine.  
R:  Well --
L:  You know, and if you're watching what you eat --
R:  -- it got to the point some of the clothes weren't fitting.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And just -- I don't know.  
L:  [NOISE].
R:  It didn't feel good.
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  And even with just the six pounds, I feel better.  I think the winter's the worst.
L:  Right.
R:  The winter time, when you're not -- can't get out and do things.  But if I could get down to a hundred and thirty, I'd be very happy.
L:  Mhm.  Well, I don't know if they have Curves in your area.  It's a nationwide chain.  You should look into it.
R:  I'll check into that.
L:  It's so cheap.  I mean, it --
R:  And it sounds --
L:  Most clubs cost, like, you know, seventy to a hundred dollars a month and it's thirty bucks a month, here anyway, and I just can't believe how easy it is.  I thought it was kind of cheesy at first, you know, I'm not into that, like, whole, like, "Let's work out" and like, you know, the techno music and all that sort of stuff, but I mean, it's just a bunch of women there that are trying to get their heart rates up.  There's all different kinds of ages and --
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  -- nobody wears spandex and it's not cheesy at all.  I was -- it's really been a pleasant surprise.
R:  Oh, I'll have to check that out.
L:  And -- and I look forward to going now, 'cause I go with my girlfriends and, you know --
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  -- if -- if you talk -- it's just someone to talk with, the circuit goes a lot faster.
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  You're done before you know it and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- then there's this nice stretching area and you can go stretch out and you know and then you're out of there within, like, forty minutes and get on with life and you know -- so it's just strange, when you think about our ancestors, like, peop- you know, back in the olden days?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Getting a work out like that was part -- just came with every day living.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know what I mean?  It's just so strange to think that we have to pay money and go to a special club now, to get the kind of work out that, like --
