L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Yes.
R:  Hi, [SIGH] my name is Beth.
L:  I'm Christa.
R:  Oh, hi. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, do you exercise regularly or ?
L:  I wall.
R:  Do you walk?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh. [SIGH] Well, I g- I don't [SIGH] do a lot of walking because I do house cleaning and that type of thing, so I'm [SIGH] usually quite busy [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE] Okay.
R:  -- you know, getting exercise that way. [LAUGH] 
L:  This is my first time doing this.
R:  M- me too.
L:  Who is this through?
R:  [SIGH] Um, it's one of the universities in the States.
L:  And where are you at?
R:  I'm in Canada.
L:  Oh, I thought -- am I being paid for this call or am I paying f-
R:  I believe you are.  I believe its ten dollars per call.
L:  Okay.  I know I signed up for a bunch of stuff but, [MN] you know, you just have no idea how they -- I got all these messages on my answer machine while I was gone.
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] 
L:  And its like, "Oh, crap, where's this stuff coming from?"
R:  Mhm, mhm. [SIGH] So, well, it should be --
L:  How long -- how long ago did you sign up for it?
R:  [SIGH] Oh, couple of weeks I think.
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was a couple of weeks, so 
L:  Do you know the name of the company, by chance?
R:  No, I don't.  Fisher is all --
L:  Fisher?
R:  -- I can think of. [SIGH] 
L:  Right.  Huh.
R:  So, that's the only name I can recall.
L:  Yeah, wh- do you not remember where you signed up for that?
R:  I signed up on the internet.
L:  Well, yeah, I know, but do you remember --
R:  [SIGH] But I don't know, I can't -- [SIGH] you should have a, uh -- a confirmation letter or something in your --
L:  [SIGH] Uh, I'm doing email right now and I don't see anything.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  It's weird.  I must have heard about it through one of the [NOISE] sweepstakes groups or something on line.
R:  Oh, it could be, could be.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that.  So [SIGH] -- so, roughly how -- how much do you walk in a day?
L:  Well, right now, none, I just broke both of my feet.
R:  Oh, no.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] How did that happen?
L:  I don't know. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Oh.
L:  I really don't know. 
R:  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] That must have been quite [SIGH] --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- [SIGH] painful.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, this is your first survey with them?
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  And so what are we supposed to be doing?
R:  [SIGH] We're supposed to be talking about physical fitness.
L:  And then what are they doing, recording that?
R:  [SIGH] I would imagine they are recording it.
L:  All right.
R:  Um --
L:  Well, you would think that they would send you something in the mail --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, regular postal mail regarding this.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, you would, wouldn't you?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] But, well, whatever, I guess they [SIGH] do it the way they want to, you know, since --
L:  I guess so.
R:  -- since they're paying the bills I guess we kinda [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- have to --
L:  Play by their rules.
R:  -- let them [LAUGH] decide what to do. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right, right.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  So, how much -- wh- what do you do for exercise?
R:  Well, I -- I -- like I said, I'm a -- I do house cleaning.
L:  Right.
R:  And I, um -- [LIPSMACK] I get quite a bit of exercise that way --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and that -- sometimes it's not quite enough, but, [SIGH] you know.
L:  Right.  Well, I do a lot of walking and I walk, uh -- I volunteer at the, uh, humane centre and walk dogs over there too.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, that would be interesting.
L:  It's fun.
R:  [SIGH] Do you ever have any dogs that aren't very friendly, or ?
L:  Mm, no, I think most of 'em, being rescued, they just want somebody to give them some attention.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, I guess that's true.
L:  [NOISE] And by the time it comes to the point where you get to walk 'em, they've already been through all the process.  You know, of finding out if they're friendly or not, because they're -- being in a holding tank for being adopted.
R:  Oh, right, right, of course.
L:  Yep.
R:  Yeah, I wouldn't have thought of that.  It just, uh, [SIGH] you know.
L:  Right.
R:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] One of those things you don't [SIGH] --
L:  Do you --
R:  -- tend to think --
L:  -- [MN] 
R:  -- about I guess, [LAUGH] you know.
L:  -- do you have a humane society out there?
R:  Well, we do have, um, [LIPSMACK] what we called the S.P.C. -- S.P.C.A. [SIGH] which is --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- the society for protection of animals or something.
L:  To prevent cruelty of animals, yeah, right.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK], but, um, I live on a small island.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, I don't have any.
L:  So, where in Canada are you, then?
R:  [SIGH] I'm B.C.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  I'm in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
R:  Mm?
L:  I'm in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hm. [SIGH] That would -- I've never been to Wisconsin, I don't think.
L:  No?  Oh, you're not --
R:  No.
L:  -- missing anything. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, no, I've been to, you know, like, a number of the states but not [SIGH] -- not all of them, far from all of them [LAUGH] that's for sure. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [SIGH] So, you know.  But, uh, no, I think walking dogs would be -- [SIGH] it would be interesting.
L:  Yeah, it's fun.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN] I, uh -- my membership just lapsed at the, uh, health centre, so that was okay 'cause during that [LAUGH] -- the last two weeks of it is when I broke my feet, so 
R:  Oh, gee.
L:  Yep, so that -- nothing to worry about.
R:  Mm, that would -- that must be painful, though?
L:  It's not so bad, I get my casts off in two weeks, so 
R:  Oh, oh. [SIGH] 
L:  Or a week and a half now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, [LAUGH] it won't be so bad.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, I guess. [SIGH] It just, uh -- I don't know, it would be, I think, painful, and I'm not into pain, believe me. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, oh, well, you survive.
R:  So, but, uh [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] -- uh, well, it would --
L:  Now, have you gotten a lot of phone calls already from --
R:  Um --
L:  -- this place?
R:  -- I -- [MN] I -- actually, a couple of them I couldn't take.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, [SIGH] w- and one of them I was here for, [SIGH] but it was, um [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] -- they wanted, uh -- you had to talk about the US public school system.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Well, I don't know anything about the US public school system --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- so I didn't figure that I should be [LAUGH] --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- participating. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] I guess I'm skeptical on this.  I don't understand why somebody would go and call you and then, uh, pay you for your time and --
R:  Well, I think it's a survey or something --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to do with the, uh, [SIGH] you know, like, this -- whatever it is they're doing, you know. [SIGH] 
L:  Right.  Well, see how much --
R:  [SIGH] I'm just trying to look through my email and see if I see anything right now. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And --
L:  Yeah, I don't -- I don't see a thing and I've been gone so, um, I've got oodles.  I save everything too, I mean --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I mean, I got, like, ten thousand emails sorted into folders here.
R:  Oh.
L:  And there isn't a thing.
R:  Huh. [SIGH] Mm, I haven't come across it yet, but that's --
L:  Yeah, me either.
R:  -- not surprising.  I have quite a few, but [SIGH] you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- not --
L:  Do you do sweep --
R:  -- I see I have a bunch.
L:  --do you -- do you do sweepstakes on line?
R:  [SIGH] No, I don't.
L:  No?
R:  No.
L:  I was wondering if we heard about it at the same place. [LAUGH] 
R:  No, no, I don't do sweepstakes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I, um [LIPSMACK] -- I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] I don't see -- [SIGH] it could be --
L:  I just wonder where I heard about it to, uh -- in here. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] I'm -- I know it was [LIPSMACK] -- it was a university and I'm pretty sure it began with a B.
L:  Hm.
R:  But I know I would have kept the [SIGH] -- the thing, but just what I've --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- where I've stuck it, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is, uh, another --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [SIGH] question.
L:  [MN] I know, I save everything.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  I save every confirmation, I save everything that has a password, I save every introductory letter [SIGH] and I don't have anything regarding this.
R:  Hm. [LIPSMACK] Well, I'm sure you must have signed up for it, so  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I'm sure I have.
R:  [SIGH] Uh, no global test market.  No.  No, that wasn't it. [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] Not there.  Hm.
L:  Hm.
R:  [SIGH] I don't know, it's in here somewhere, I know that. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] So, [SIGH] but -- so -- so, you -- in a couple of weeks you'll be able to get back to walking, or ?
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, within a week and a half.  Oh, here, I found it, "Thank you for your interest in Fisher telephone speech study supporting linguistic research technology and development. [SIGH] Fisher participants will take part in one to three telephone calls talking to other participants, blah, blah, blah, blah".
R:  Hm.
L:  You get paid anywhere from fifteen to thirty dollars for it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Okay, I signed --
R:  Yeah, that's what it --
L:  I signed up through -- through one of my girlfriend's groups.
R:  Oh, oh.
L:  She was the one that does it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Probably -- 
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, like I say, I know I've got it --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- in here somewhere too --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I'm just not sure where.
L:  Yeah, well, I -- I found it, that's the information, so I feel better now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause I have no idea what you're getting into, it's just like --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- it's like [MN] when I got the phone call the other day for it, I said -- t- told my husband, I said, [SIGH] "Well, how do you know what they're doing, you know, if you click the button, and I being charged ninety nine ninety nine to talk to somebody in Haiti or something?"
R:  Mhm.
L:  So.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, well, exactly, uh, but, I mean, the -- I know with it I was told we wouldn't be charged for long distance 'cause --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they called us.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, [SIGH] you know.
L:  Well, that works.  I got long distance blocked on my phone anyway. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, do you?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hm.
L:  I got kids. [LAUGH] 
R:  Ah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] Everything that wants to get done has to go through a calling card.
R:  Mhm.
