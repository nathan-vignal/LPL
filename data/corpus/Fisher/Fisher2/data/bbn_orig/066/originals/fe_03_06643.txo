L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.  
L:  Hi.
R:  My name's Eva.
L:  Hi, I'm Adrienne.
R:  Nice to meet ya.
L:  Nice you meet you.  Where are you?
R:  I'm in California.  Where are yo-
L:  Oh well, I'm in New York, where --
R:  Oh.  I didn't quite hear what they said the question was?
L:  It -- yes.  Um, I called twice.  [COUGH].  The -- it's supposed to be censorship and are you for, uh, forbidding students in private and public schools to read certain books.
R:  Oh.  
L:  Do you have ch- do you have children?
R:  I don't, but I'm a student --
L:  Yeah, I don't either, but you know, you can still have a -- and -- and I'm not sure if they mean -- I assume they mean in the context of the school, you know, curriculum, as opposed to, you know, reading them elsewhere.
R:  Yeah, definite, I would assume so too.
L:  Yeah, and um, uh, but it says the students forbid to read certain books.  Um, which is sort of confusing because the -- the school be forbidding to read certain books, you know?  Maybe it's the schools who are forbidding --
R:  My -- I would assume that it's the school --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that may be powers above, like, the school board --
L:  Yeah, forbid to read certain books.
R:  -- forbidding teachers to put out these certain books in the curriculum.
L:  I don't -- I don't how to answer that one.  [LAUGH] because I guess it depends on what the book is and um, there's such different views in different communities around the country, you know?  
R:  There are definitely.
L:  And um, uh, what would be offensive to one may, you know -- living in New York city, we don't get into that kind of stuff, you know?  We're just lucky to have the schools working and the teachers --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- teachers showing up --
R:  Oh, that's --
L:  -- and the kids not beating them up and, um, we're happy they can read [LAUGH] whatever they read.
R:  Oh [LAUGH].
L:  So, um, we're not much into the -- the overall topic of censorship.  How do you feel about that?
R:  I'm very -- in general, I'm very against censorship.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  However, in this case, I think it's okay.  
L:  You think it's okay?
R:  To an extent.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  I think it depends on -- in -- for what reason the book is being censored.
L:  Yes, exactly.
R:  I think for vi- reasons of violence --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I have no problem with books being censored.  Um, just I know in my high school, I was asked to read A Clockwork Orange.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Have you read that?
L:  I saw the movie.
R:  And it's horrible.  I mean, it's incredibly violent, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there -- I think -- and the imagery in the book is even more so than the, um, in the movie.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, I personally asked my teacher to not have to read it, because it disturbed me so much.
L:  And what was the reply?
R:  He let me not -- he let me read something --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- else instead.
L:  Right.  
R:  Yeah, because it --
L:  Was that a re- was that a requirement of the school or the requirement of that individual teacher?
R:  Um, it was of that teacher.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It was for that specific class.
L:  Yeah 'cause that's an odd -- it's an odd book to be picking on, you know, as -- as a part of a curriculum.  You know?
R:  Definitely.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Definitely.  It wasn't part of the core curriculum.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I think that he um -- you could opt out of it was um probably the answer.  Yeah, you know, um, I'm not into censorship particularly.
R:  Mm.
L:  You know, I think this politically correct stuff doesn't go with me very much.
R:  [LAUGH] people need to be exposed to new ideas, I think.
L:  Yes, they do.  And I think this country's gotten very, very narrow and um, it scares me --
R:  I agree.  
L:  -- frankly.
R:  Me, too.
L:  If you don't have new ideas and um -- you can reject them, but to throw them out there, um, you should have the good sense to, you know, just like -- what's this movie idea?  You know, movies are out.  Now, when I was a kid, my mother wouldn't let us go to a lot of movies, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause they were too violent and um, actually, she was right, 'cause I went to visit a friend one weekend, her mother let us go see this movie and I can still think of it now [LAUGH] the violence.  I was under the seat, but um --
R:  So "Why did her mother take us to see that?"
L:  No, I don't think -- her mother didn't take us, and she probably didn't know --
R:  I bet, like, you --
L:  -- what it was about.  Her mother was very conservative.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  We just, you know, I don't blame her mother, her mother's a lovely lady, I still know her.  Um, but um, and um, I guess we didn't think too much about it.  I didn't think of my parents as being narrow minded, but um, well, they were very careful, I would say, you know?  We couldn't do certain things, but um, I don't think it ruined my life and -- and I've certainly grown up to be very broad minded, so um I -- I don't consider it was -- was bad, at the time.
R:  I think there are some things that are unnecessary for people to see.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or to hear or to --
L:  You mean, youngsters?
R:  Yeah, I mean youngsters.
L:  Yeah, youngsters, right.  I mean, when you're an adult you should be able to look or not look or hear or not hear.  You know?
R:  Make it disappear.
L:  Yeah.  So, um --
R:  I think like you were saying, though, about how our nation is narrowing itself.
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  But I think there are things um, for example, the Patriot Act, or whatever, that could lead to very unnecessary censorship.
L:  The what?
R:  Um, could lead to unnecessary --
L:  Yeah, well, we're --
R:  You know --
L:  -- we're seeing it.
R:  -- things being deemed um, um terrorist or, you know, whatever --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, things that just are taken to an extreme.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well -- 
R:  And then ban- being banned.
L:  -- it's a difficult thing [COUGH].  I mean, you know, you can't be all the way for something or against something 'cause it's -- I don't know, I'm sort of an in between person.  It depends on the subject and the situation and the person, you know?
R:  I agree.
L:  And now the kids are so mature, so I -- I really hesitate to venture what anybody should read or not read, 'cause a lot of them are much smarter than I was when I was, like, twenty.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  People are exposed to new stuff.
L:  Yeah, I mean, they're almost growing up too quickly.  It's -- it's --
R:  Yeah, I agree.
L:  -- kinda scary.  I see them with these bo- huge, um, book bags, you know, carrying them, and they're like seven or eight years old.
R:  Horrible.
L:  And um I don't know, I had a pretty good education in public school.  I don't remember carrying all that kind of stuff around, you know?  
R:  Mm.
L:  Um, so um, but that's not censorship, so I might -- I don't know.  It's um -- it's very puzzling to figure out what's going on these days.
R:  Do you feel like the education sys- the system in New York is really very poor?
L:  It's um --
R:  The quality of education the kids are getting?
L:  It's -- it depends.  We have some excellent schools.  Unfortunately, they're -- we have a lot of specialized schools that are public.  You know, science and math and um, uh, drama and fashion and --
R:  That are public schools?
L:  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
R:  Oh.
L:  And they're -- they're outstanding.  Outstanding.  You have to qualify to get into them, and uh, or like where I live, which happens to be the most affluent, even though I'm not, affluent area code in the whole country, it's a public school, everybody wants to go there.  They advertise it as part of the um -- the um -- what shall I say, the -- um, in the real estate section here, um but --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- yeah, so we do have some very outstanding schools, which surprises everybody outside.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Um, but it's in the -- unfortunately it's always the poorer neighborhoods, you know --
R:  Definitely.
L:  And uh, so they -- the mayor now, Bloomberg, is working very hard on this and he's not getting the credit for it.  You know, because when you try to break something down and change it, a lot of people don't like it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So it's getting very, very bad press, but um, and it's too early in the game.  I mean, th- they're all screaming and yelling and meanwhile they got nice raises, but they're not cooperating and I'm not against unions, I'm not at all, my dad was a union leader, but um, they're -- they're just not being helpful.  You know, they- he's trying to restructure it and um very, very concerned about children should learn, 'cause if you don't learn and you graduate -- if you don't graduate, what have you got to look forward to in these days?  You know, nothing.
R:  Exact- nothing.
L:  So um, but --
R:  And if --
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  And if they're gonna -- I think everyone would agree that children should learn, you know?
L:  Oh, absolutely.
R:  I think it's sad, sort of the way -- I don't think teachers make poor salaries, but I think they are undervalued.  
L:  Well, I'm not so sure.
R:  Comparatively.
L:  I mean, you know you -- you -- you get a very good lifestyle, where it lets you go off, you know, for the summers and holidays and um take sabbaticals and get paid for them and remember, here in New York, you only have to work twenty years and you get half of your last year's salary and they all work overtime in the last year, and people don't realize that, you know?  So it -- it's not a bad deal, 'cause you're only aged, what, you're in your mid forties and you can go for another career.  Who can do that in private business, you know?
R:  No one. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  After -- after twenty years in education, you are --
L:  Any -- anything that's a public job.  You know?
R:  You're entitled to half --
L:  Anyway, we're getting off the subject --
R:  -- your last --
L:  -- that they wanted us to talk about --
R:  Definitely.  [LAUGH].
L:  -- censorship.  [LAUGH].  And um, but they -- you know, I don't know anything -- I've never read anything about censoring what they read in uh -- in New York schools.  I'm not saying they don't, but um, that never seems to be a uh situation because we have so many other situations to deal with, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Before we get to that subject.  Where are you in California?
R:  I'm in Santa Barbara.
L:  Oh, so that's -- they probably have very good schools there, right?
R:  I -- yeah, you know, in all honesty, I'm not that familiar.  I moved down here for college, so I'm not that familiar with --
L:  [MN].
R:  -- um the elementary schools and high schools.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But it seems like it -- I mean, it's uh -- it's, like, I'm kind of in the same situation as you, I'm not very affluent, but I -- it's a very affluent area.
L:  Yes, right.  Exactly.
R:  So -- so -- yeah --
L:  But people like that, if -- if they're unhappy with something, you'd hear about it, right?
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah, and you haven't heard anything about censorship?
R:  No.
L:  Yeah, so I think, um -- um I don't know.
R:  I know one thing that isn't -- it's not exactly censorship, but it's kind of an infringement of rights --
