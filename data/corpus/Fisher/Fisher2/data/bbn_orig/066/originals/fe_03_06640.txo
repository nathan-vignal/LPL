R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.  
R:  I didn't hear a tone, did you?
L:  There was no tone.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  Ah?
R:  This is Debbie in Ohio.
L:  Hello.  I am Stefanie in South Dakota.
R:  Oh, how interesting.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Well, I guess our topic is whether certain books should be censored?
L:  Mhm.  
R:  Mhm.  So we're supposed to talk about that for ten minutes, huh?
L:  Yeah, I guess.  Apparently.  
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  If you ramble, though, that's okay.
R:  [LAUGH].  Okay.  Well, do you ki- do you have children?
L:  Yes.  
R:  Do they go to public school or private?
L:  Well, um, we have a one year old, but then we have a seven year old.  She has gone to public school and next year she is going to be home schooled. 
R:  Oh, interesting.  Yeah, I um, I home schooled mine for a little bit, and now they're in, um, Christian school.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  So sounds like we'll cover all the bases.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  Oh, well, I -- uh, I -- I can just start this off.  I definitely think certain books should be censored from the schools.  
L:  Okay.  Why?
R:  Well, uh, I -- I have a real hard time with -- with some popular books now, like for instance, Harry Potter.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't want a seven or eight year old in a classroom reading Harry Potter books.  Um, because I think they make it difficult to distinguish what's real from what's fantasy.  And um, to be, like for instance, my kids read, um, C.S. Lewis books, the Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe.
L:  Mhm?
R:  And I compare it to those, because those are very much fantasy, but the -- the evil characters are very distinctly evil, and the good characters -- you know -- you know who the good characters are and who the evil characters are.  In Harry Potter, they make Harry look like a good guy, but he's doing a lot of things good guys shouldn't do.
L:  Such as?  I guess I totally disagree with you, but go ahead?
R:  Oh, really?  
L:  Yes, I do. 
R:  Oh, that's interesting.
L:  I have a big problem with that.  I believe that the Harry Potter books are wonderful.
R:  Really?
L:  I was a mass communications with an emphasis in journalism major in college --
R:  Um, English with communications.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]. 
L:  I --
R:  So this is going to get good.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  We may take on more than the [inaudible].
L:  [LAUGH].  No, they cut you off.  But --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I think that they instill in children a spirit of friendship, loyalty.  I don't think -- I know that a -- there are a lot of Christian parents who have a problem with the whole magic, witchcraft thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't think that comes into play.  My child knows the difference between fantasy and reality.  I mean --
R:  Ra- how old, though?
L:  She's seven.  She's in the second grade.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  I really --
L:  I'm sure she realizes that --
R:  -- cannot stand Harry Potter, so this is interesting.
L:  Oh, I love the books.
R:  I cannot stand them.  I -- I think they --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- they so much cross the line of, um, uh, the -- the thing that bothers me, too, is that they -- they use, uh, spell making and -- and um, incantations and things like that, and they make it look like it's okay, and it's normal and um --
L:  Well, so let me ask you this?
R:  Mhm?
L:  If someone who is now Protestant, who was raised a Roman Catholic --
R:  You are?
L:  Yes.
R:  Ah.  That's interesting.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  
R:  Okay?
L:  I mean, I was, you know, Roman Catholic.  Went to Catholic school.
R:  Right?
L:  When you say a prayer, is that not some -- I mean, just out of cont- is that not some type of spell or incantation?
R:  What, prayer?
L:  Yeah?
R:  Oh, no.  
L:  Oh, yeah.  I mean --
R:  Oh -- 
L:  -- it --
R:  -- no, no, no, no.
L:  In my circumstance, growing up in the Roman Catholic church, the same prayers were used over and over --
R:  Now, you -- you're -- you've got to distinguish prayer in religion and prayer in Christianity, because there is a big difference.
L:  Well, I mean, just --
R:  I mean, if you're talking --
L:  -- when you -- when you get into the Harry Potter thing and you're talking about spells and incantations --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- prayer in its own form can be a spell or incantation.
R:  I'll give you the difference --
L:  What are you asking for, when you're --
R:  -- of --
L:  -- asking for in a spell?  A result.  What are you asking for --
R:  Who are you asking it from, though?  Who are you asking it from?
L:  You're asking it -- well --
R:  In prayer, you're asking for the power and the wisdom and the guidance from God.  
L:  Mm.
R:  In a spell, you are either, uh, advertently or inadvertently asking it from -- from evil or satan. 
L:  Oh.
R:  I do --
L:  I don't believe --
R:  -- believe -- I don't believe there's any such thing as white magic. 
L:  I don't believe that.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, well are really --
L:  I -- [LAUGH].
R:  -- opposite.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  And -- and just to let you know, I'm a missionary kid.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, uh, I have lived in South America where I saw voodoo and +spiritualism and Catholicism, mixed with +spiritualism --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which was called Makom Baders[?] --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and I -- I am so sensitive to that line.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I very much see it being crossed.  Um, I think people in America are very ignorant of +spiritualism and -- and what types of things are starting to delve into +spiritualism and I -- I see, like, the New Age stuff --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- as, um, getting into +spiritualism, really.  It's just a fancy way to say +spiritualism, but they call it New Age.
L:  Well, and see, I have a problem with the fact that -- and I know we're truly going off the subject [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] yeah.  
L:  But that's okay, because you're just supposed to talk.
R:  They just want to hear our voice.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  But we -- I was raised Roman Catholic, my husband, devout Methodist --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- which are totally different.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Oh [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, I'm -- I'm aware.  [LAUGH].
L:  And um, we were attending a church that our neighbors -- a church.  It's called -- it was called, uh, Faith Alive.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And we thought -- and it's a word face church.
R:  Kinda like Vineyard?
L:  Um --
R:  Similar?
L:  Somewhat.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's -- it's the TVN network people.
R:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  And uh --
R:  See, we could [inaudible].  No --
L:  But the -- I mean, I -- we were attending and we were up, you know, looking for something because we haven't been going to anything in particular.  We've just been doing our own thing, I guess you could say, at home.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And uh, well because we were both raised different reg- religions, and so we decided to go to this and, you know, it was -- it was good.  When we first went, we were a little scared because it was different.  
R:  Right.
L:  But, uh, you know, it was uplifting and so we started to go and tried to get into it.  I tried so hard, but the messages are just totally wrong to me.  As in --
R:  [MN].
L:  -- um, oh, give a dollar and you'll get a thousand back.  
R:  Oh, prosperity religion.
L:  And instead of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- yep.  Yes.
R:  See, this is religion again.
L:  And instead of envelopes, they call them seed-velopes, 'cause you're sowing your seed into the kingdom.
R:  Oh.  Yeah.
L:  Ugh.  And so since that episode, I've been actually looking quite a bit on different religions, not just necessarily Christian, on the internet.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  Because I feel like --
R:  Well, be careful.  
L:  Well, no, I feel like --
R:  I can be bold because I don't know you doggone it, and [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  
R:  And I'll never talk to you again.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  Hey!  No.  
R:  But be careful.  
L:  But -- but I feel like --
R:  Seriously.
L:  -- I had gotten -- well, I feel as if I had gotten sucked into something that I didn't necessarily want to be sucked into because they were so charismatic.  
R:  Ooh.  
L:  You know?  I mean, it was just totally different than anything I'd ever experienced, laying on of hands and -- and that -- you know, and then if you're healed and your healing goes away, it's because you were bad.  
R:  Oh.  See, that's not -- that's not --
L:  [MN].
R:  [inaudible].
L:  And -- and so maybe I'm kind of leaning more towards -- my husband says I've -- I'm just too damn Catholic.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  Well, you know -- you know, ah, uh, if -- if -- if I can give you a blunt little, uh, advice the -- the more you --  you -- and you sound like an intelligent person, and the more you study, um, the Bible on your own --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and really learn the context and uh the setting and -- and um, just really learn scripture, then you will -- it's very easy to discern when -- when something like that comes up, little red flags come up.
L:  Well, my --
R:  It's like [MN] that's not scriptural, you know?
L:  My biggest one was when our neighbor said, "You know, I had to attend church", she had been in the Catholic church as well.
R:  Mhm.
L:  She'd married into it and got divorced, but when she said, "I -- I didn't quite get it and didn't quite get it and then I sat there for three years and finally got it", and I thought, "What the hell?  You have to sit there for three years to get it?"  No, you should feel it right away.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  If it's the right thing for you.  
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, you know?
R:  Ri- right.  
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Well, I'll tell you, the -- the -- it happens right away, but then it takes years, I think, to uh sort through the junk.
L:  But if you don't believe --
R:  And there's so much religion out there, that gets in the way.
L:  Oh.
R:  You know?  It -- it really does, and I -- I'll just tell you, my dad came from an all Catholic family and became a protestant pastor.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I've been there, done that.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  
R:  And -- but you know, the neat thing, though, I loved getting --
