R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Oh, hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  Um --
L:  I'm Jenny.
R:  I'm Natasha.
L:  Nice to speak to you.
R:  Uh, you too, and I'm sorry, what was the topic again?  Was do we think --
L:  Do you think that --
R:  -- public or --
L:  -- public schools have the right to tell students they can't read certain books.  Uh, I guess I -- I think that that's okay within reason.  I mean, obviously kids can't [LAUGH] shouldn't read certain books.  
R:  Right.  
L:  What do you think?  Hello?
R:  Well, I think, um, um, I think if that means they won't have certain books in a library, that that's fine with me.  If that means that they try to um -- push certain beliefs on people, then -- then I wouldn't agree with that.
L:  Yeah.  I agree with you there.  Definitely if they're saying, you know, that they can't read certain books because of, like, religious content or something like that, then I don't agree with that, but if it's because it's just inappropriate for children --
R:  Right.
L:  -- then that's fine.  Um --
R:  If that --
L:  I don't know.  They sh- maybe should've mentioned the specific type of books that they were talking about.
R:  Uh, who's gonna make the decision, I wonder?  What's appropriate --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- and inappropriate?  
L:  Mm.  I don't know.  If it's the right -- if it's books in the library, I guess it should be the librarians and the teachers that are assigning certain readings.  I don't know.  Um --
R:  Well, you know, I don't think that children should be forced to read certain books.  I think that they should have the choice not to read certain books, or their parents --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- have the -- 
L:  Like, what kind of books?
R:  Um, I don't know, just -- some books that their parents may feel are not uh necessary --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I mean, there are certain books, um, um, I have a younger sister and she's in high school still and there were some books on the reading list that they had to read.
L:  Mhm?
R:  That um my mother thought was just, you know, a little over the top, a little racy.
L:  Uh-huh.  Is -- is your family, like, um, would you say that they're over -- like, a little bit protective over, you know, more than normal or --
R:  Um --
L:  -- are they just --
R:  No.  No.
L:  No.
R:  I -- I don't think that they're -- they're liberal.
L:  Mhm.  Where are you -- where are you --
R:  [inaudible] but um -- south.
L:  In the south, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  But uh, still I think, you know, um if you're responsible for your children until they're adults --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and you think that part of their raising should be exclusive of certain materials you think will not be to their benefit, I think that, you know, there should be another option.  
L:  Yeah.  Definitely.  It's definitely up to the parents.  I mean, they definitely ha- should have the final say.  
R:  So --
L:  But --
R:  -- you know, I don't know.  Should the school say, "No, you don't -- if your parents think you shouldn't read that book, you don't have to read that book, you can do some alternate work"?
L:  Yeah.  I -- I think that would be the right way to handle it.  I mean, there's every -- in every school and every situation, there's always parents that find different things in the curriculum objec- objectionable and usually schools are prepared to deal with that in uh -- you know, a manner that's acceptable to them.  So, I think they should definitely have an option.
R:  I think --
L:  Maybe they should inform the parents at a time what books the kids are gonna be reading and if they have a problem, then they can voice that.  I mean, I don't know too many books that are that, you know, ridiculous for children to be reading or high school kids even that should be totally forbidden.  But, you know, most schools aren't gonna come right out with something crazy.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  At least, I don't think so.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I don't think this book was just over the top, but still, it was something --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- she thought, you know?
L:  It's just not necessary?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is that really, ha, literature?  Is that worth studying?
L:  Do you know, like, what kind of book it was that -- or just --
R:  Ah, you know, I -- she did tell me the name of the book and -- and uh I think maybe I had actually read it, but it had just -- I think um it -- there was some foul language in there and uh --
L:  Yeah.  I don't um --
R:  And -- and uh, teenage boys discussing masturbation.  
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  I remember us reading some books in high school that, you know, as I was reading it, there would be a curse and -- or something like -- something like what you just said and, you know, it'd be like everybody would be, like, "Whoo hoo, look at -- oh, gee, read that", blah, blah, blah, but you know, you can't -- you can't keep that kinda thing away from a child.  You can't shelter them forever.  That's -- it's gonna -- it's not like they've never heard it and never going to hear it and if it's part of a piece of literature that the school thinks is [SIGH] you know, beneficial to them, then I don't really think it's that big of a deal.  
R:  Well, I agree that you can't shelter them from everything.
L:  But I wouldn't -- I wouldn't have them reading something with, you know, graphic sexual content or something really violent.  I wouldn't want my kid reading that.
R:  Right.
L:  But the occasional swear word and something -- you know, a lot of books that are out, like, coming of age things that are a little bit racy, but you know, something that kids talk about anyway.  
R:  Right.  Mm.  I agree --
L:  So --
R:  -- that they do talk about it anyway.
L:  Mhm.  And even, you know, that some of the classes teach things that, you know, the sex ed classes and everything that -- nothing that they don't know about.  So [SIGH].  But then again, that's a big controversy in -- in itself.  [LAUGH].  
R:  Yes.  That's true.  And --
L:  I don't know if it's different in the south or -- I live in New York City, so I think it's a little more liberal here.  
R:  Oh, I'm pretty sure.  Um, no, I guess there's about the same argument, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Some parents think children should know that and they'd rather not have the burden of telling them themselves.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then there are the --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- other -- the other parents who think, you know, um -- to say technical words.
L:  Mhm.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] it's just, you know, of satan.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  So --
L:  Well, I guess it all just depends on your background, the way you -- your parents, the kids' parents were raised and the way that they want to -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- protect their children.  
R:  Well --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I -- you know, I -- I guess that's true.  There is a certain acceptance of different things in other parts of the country.  Here they're --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- there are more churches than gas stations.
L:  Where do you live?
R:  I live in Tennessee.  
L:  Okay.  Yeah.  My boyfriend's from the south.  He's from Texas and whenever I go down there, I notice that there's a big difference, so -- and I've been to Tennessee too, but I don't know.  Anywhere where you have a more diverse group --
