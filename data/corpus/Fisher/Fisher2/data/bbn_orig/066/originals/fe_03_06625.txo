R:  Hi, my name's Sammie.
L:  Hi, I'm Gail.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  I'm in Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh, I'm in New Jersey.
R:  Oh, hi.
L:  So, it's not that far.
R:  No.  Ah, --
L:  Well, yes, I think they do have the right to tell the students what to read, um, they have to make a curriculum, um, [SIGH] I -- I don't know, um, if they're talking about, like, banned books or what the whole topic is about, really?
R:  Um, I believe censorship on some -- on -- isn't good in a whole, but, like, for school kids, you should have to have some kind of boundaries.  'Cause they can b- be saying they don't want them to read certain, like, religious things, or, you know, different ideas, I think it's, the more ideas you have influenced on yourself the more you grow, but of course, [MN] no porno, and things like that, for kids, you've got to have different points of view.
L:  True, I don't, I don't, I don't know if that's what they necessarily mean.  Um, I don't know, I think that -- what, um, I think that the schools should be able to choose the books, for instance, like, the Harry Potter books and stuff, you know, some people are against them because of witchcraft, and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the occult, but if those people sat down and actually read the books, they'd see that that's not really what it's about, you know?
R:  Yeah, I was thinking that when I was saying that.  Like, they were banning Harry Potter.
L:  Right.
R:  They didn't ban Cinderella. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, --
R:  This is --
L:  -- it was okay to be a wicked stepmother --
R:  Yeah, this is fantasy, [LAUGH] this is make believe for little kids.
L:  Right, that's what it's all about.  So, I don't really think that, ah,  -- I-I think the schools should not ban them, I think that they should have the right to choose, you know, what their students read, but I don't think that, ah,  -- well, let's see, the whole topic was  should they have the right to choose, and I -- I do think they should have the right to choose, but I also think that the parents should, ah, be involved in those decisions.
R:  There should be parental input. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But then, you're -- the majority of people that are very vocal are very, um, fanatic about what they want and what they don't want.
L:  True, true.
R:  Because --
L:  Do you have kids in school?
R:  Yeah.  From eighth grade to graduated.
L:  Okay, I have, ah, a preschooler and a first grader and I have my kids in a charter school where it's run by the parents, and --
R:  Oh, there you go. 
L:  So --
R:  We live way out in the country in the coal mine areas.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] We have no charter school!  Um, and it's very -- education's geared towards exactly what the area is.
L:  Right.
R:  Very, um, conservative?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And some of the teachers have been told not to read this or that, --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- which is ridiculous.
L:  We're ten minutes outside New York City.
R:  Oh, we're three hours out of New York City.
L:  Okay, so we're -- you know, everything new, and up and coming, and all that, is here.  [LAUGH] so, --
R:  Yeah, and they're back in the seventies yet here.
L:  Sure.  Sure, yeah, I have relatives out in Pennsylvania, not as far out as you.  But, ah, yeah.
R:  Yeah, we have a friend that lives in -- ah, they were in Curnie[?], but they moved out of there.
L:  Okay, that's about fifteen minutes from here.
R:  Arlington, or -- what's that?
L:  North Arlington?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Sure, sure, I have --
R:  They've moved into that area, now.  But, um, I just think, um, especially the [inaudible] districts, they really try to censor what the kids do.  And what they read, what they see, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, it's outrageous, you know, they're just getting open about AIDS and things.
L:  Oh, wow, yeah, well see, we had a lot of people, um,  fr- right from this area killed in the World Trade Center attacks, and stuff, so -- 
R:  Of course.
L:  -- and so pretty much no topic is off limits here, and --
R:  Um, are --
L:  -- you know, I mean, we -- we know people personally from the town, and stuff, you know, so --
R:  They censored our kids to the point about the World Trade Center, till the one school district was banning talking about it, it was too upsetting.
L:  Oh, that's too bad.
R:  No, and these kids were missing an opportunity to learn and grow, and try to have more diverse thinking.
L:  Right, right, well you know, the -- the whole idea that the, ah, -- that they should pick the books, you hopefully have enlightened educators, [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, you would hope, I mean, --
R:  You would --
L:  -- you know, that's --
R:  The newer ones, I'll tell you the truth, are coming in and they are trying to change curriculums.
L:  Right.
R:  The younger ones.
L:  Well, I think that happens every few years, you know, --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- everywhere, but --
R:  But, um, --
L:  -- yeah, that's what we have here, we have a constantly changing, um, society, you know, we have a lot of people move in and out, and, like, where you're from, it's probably a lot people have been there for generations, and --
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] exactly.
L:  Right, I think it makes a big difference, but our schools, um, they pick what the kids want to read and, we have a lot of diversity here, we have a lot of different, like, for my daughter's preschool Christmas pageant, they did a -- a show on Christmas, Hannukah, Ramadan, and, uh,  Kwanzaa.  And if was rather enlightening for all of us.  [LAUGH]
R:  That will be, that would definitely be.
L:  You know?  And --
R:  Our -- our kids --
L:  -- that's the kind of thing they do here, though.  So --
R:  They're, no, not in the bush here.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, well that's, that's what I'm saying, so --
R:  We have off for deer seizing, but Martin Luther King's Birthday, no.
L:  Really?  Oh.
R:  Really.  [LAUGH]
L:  See, now --
R:  They have the first day doe and buck off.
L:  Oh, my goodness.  No, we have, ah, we, I wouldn't even know when that was, but, um, [LAUGH] we have Martin Luther King's Birthday off, we had a -- a big festival for Cinco de Mayo, [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, no, no, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- not here.  No, --
L:  They start --
R:  -- we're talking the good old boys.
L:  They start Spanish lessons in kindergarten.
R:  No, our -- our -- our children aren't till high school and, then they're -- they are very sheltered, and they are censored in here, in this area, --
L:  Wow, --
R:  I really truly believe it.  Um, --
L:  Oh, that's too bad.
R:  I- it is because our kids are growing up, going huh?  when they hit the real world.
L:  Well, yeah, we're -- we're pretty much right in the thick of things here, you know, we -- we hear everything that goes on, and the kids, they know about stuff before we do.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and they tell us about it.  You know, like, when the World Trade Center attacks happened, they, they had called every parent by -- before lunch --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- to come and get their child.  They closed down all the schools, --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- everything, you know, --
R:  So -- no worries --
L:  -- so, yeah, fortunately, they don't censor.  I think the schools do have the right, though, to -- to make decisions, ultimately, but I -- again, you know, like I said, I send my daughter to a charter school so we have a lot of parental input, and, ah, --
R:  In the lower -- if you don't have the parental input, like, your school, in the lower grades, I can see -- maybe not really calling it censorship:  Selection?
L:  Right.
R:  -- but in the high school, certain books are off limit for my kids to do reports on.  
L:  Right.  By your choice or theirs, or the school?
R:  It's the school's.  They must submit their books.
L:  Okay, well, I think that's normal, though, --
R:  Um, --
L:  -- I think everyone has to submit them, and you know, 'cause I mean, I -- I do think that they should have the final say, like you said, that, you know, they shouldn't be a- able to do inappropriate explicit material, or adult material, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, but when I -- I mean, I remember growing up, and, ah, did, I think I did a Steinbeck novel in, like, fourth grade --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and it was, like, "Wow, you're reading this stuff already?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, like, well, I went through all the other books in the library, [LAUGH] you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  It was a small town, --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [LAUGH] and, ah, you know, it was, like, okay, nobody questioned anything, fine, whatever, there was none, you know, we've got to take the books off the shelf, or anything like that -- and they don't do that here now at all, you know. 
R:  Oh.  Out here they still do.
L:  If there's a question -- [LAUGH] -- if there's a question, --
R:  [LAUGH] Out here they really still do.
L:  -- though, but, you know, they'll -- they'll send things home and say, "What do you think about this, you know, what do you think about that?", and, you know, they're having, like, an emergency School Board meeting this week to discuss, ah, moving the school, and -- and allocating funds for a playground, and it's [MN] just, very parent and community involvement oriented.
R:  That must be great, to have that much --
L:  Oh, it is.
R:  Oh, that must be wonderful.  
L:  You know, but you don't feel like you have power.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  Not really.  You feel involved and you -- you know what's going on, which is great -- other than, my daughter just told me she needed a costume in two days -- but, ah, [LAUGH] you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but you feel like you can be involved and make a difference, and that's, that's a nice feeling, yeah.  So, you know, things are a little different here.  So, they really give them off for hunting season, huh?
R:  Yes, they do.
L:  Wow, that's so funny.
R:  They really do, and it's very, um, they go to school, like on Martin Luther King Day.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, generally, it's a very white area --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that sounded strange, but that's how to put it.
L:  No, that's -- that's where I grew up, too, you know.
R:  But I even say to the kids from [inaudible], did they do anything to tell you who this guy is?  No.  You had no assemblies, no nothing, you know, i- it's very --
L:  Wow.
R:  That's bad.  
L:  Yeah.  We, we, ah --
R:  If you want di- diverse kids that are tolerant of other people.
L:  Our kids came home with, uh, coloring books, with his picture, and I Had a Dream, ah, and a little speech about it, and they did a little skit at school, and taught them all about it, but my town is, ah, probably half black and half white.
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and we had, -- a few years ago, we had big riots here and, ah, because a white officer shot a black teenager, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so, there's been a lot of strides made toward ah, tolerance and diversity here, because it's
