R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, this is Sheila in Tennessee. 
L:  Hello, I'm Elsia, in New York, and uh, Brooklyn, New York.  Could you hold on a minute?
R:  Sure.
L:  Just a second.  Um, hold on.  Hello, Sheila?  
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, okay.  Uh, you know what the, uh, conf- you know what the call is? I just came off a conference call, so I'm a little confused about [LAUGH] --
R:  Okay.  
L:  Um --
R:  It says censorship as far -- but I didn't get --
L:  Ah.  Yeah.  Um, do pri- pri- um, private schools have the right to censor the reading material, I think they said --
R:  For students?
L:  Oh -- for students, yes.  Um, frankly, no, 'cause if it's education, public or private, um, they are educating the students, uh, to be full citizens, and the government itself um, in theory, um does not uh -- I was going to say encourage.  Well, yeah, okay.  The government itself has said that everyone has a right to their beliefs and um there is no censorship, okay?  
R:  Mhm.
L:  So that being the case, um, I don't think it's right that the school -- uh, private school would censor, um, any reading material, or educational material, for the students.  I know that the um -- mm.  The parents have sent their children to private schools because they want them to have a specific education, a specific kind of education.
R:  Right.
L:  But um, that specific kind of education should not include censorship.  Um, you should have the right to um know both sides or all sides, I should say, of any particular question, and you wouldn't have the right if you had censorship.  What do you think?  I could say a whole lot, I know.  [LAUGH].
R:  Well, I -- I'm from a rur- rural area where um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- there's really not that many private schools, until you get --
L:  Well, true.
R:  -- to the college level. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And um, I'm really not that familiar with them.  I mean, we're --
L:  Well, look at this way --
R:  We're all county schools.
L:  Well, look at it this way.  Um, uh, think of it as --
R:  Unless I want --
L:  -- in public schools --
R:  Right.
L:  Uh, because in some public schools, um, they run them as if they were private schools.  Or think of it in college.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, if they could, they would censor in college.  Uh, how can I say?  Um -- it --
R:  The only way I would want censorship is if I was sending my child to a private school for a specific reason, for religious reasons or something, and I --
L:  That's not --
R:  -- specifically wanted that.
L:  That is not censorship.
R:  Okay.  Other than that, I -- I can't see -- I guess I don't understand the question.
L:  Well, no, no.  I think you do.  What it is, is most people consider censorship um -- oh, as a part of uh -- how can I say?  Oh, as somebody agreeing with what they believe in, and that being the case, then the other side of what they don't believe, well, I won't say they don't want to hear it, but --
R:  They don't teach it.
L:  Um, yeah.
R:  Okay. 
L:  Um, what you're saying is, um -- well, I won't say is one sided, but a school should give all sides.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Otherwise, it is not education, really.  Um, and then -- well let's say, you know, vocational school, and I don't know if there's such a thing as a private vocational school, do you think?
R:  Uh, not here.
L:  Yeah.  Well, um, let's say there is such a thing as a private vocational school
R:  Uh-huh?
L:  Just think of it, when it comes to vocation, you have to -- well, how can I say?  In order to adequately practise that vocation --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- you have to know why you are doing it in order to do it well, um, you're not really following other -- uh, your boss's instructions because he can only show you to the job to be done, and you go ahead and do it, and if you can't do it, um well, you don't have a job. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Let's put it that way.  Um, whew, I don't even know, I got lost there.  [LAUGH].  Well, here --
R:  So it keeps you from being well rounded, seeing all -- all these all areas and making a decision on your own as an adult.
L:  Well, yes.
R:  Later in life.
L:  Um, ev- even when you graduate --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you see, here in -- I'm in Brooklyn, New York, okay?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I'm speaking from -- apart from experience, because um I'm also -- I also was a teacher.  Well, am still a teacher.  And I have, um -- I do teach adults, and I find that a lot of adults -- it's not so much one sided, they just want one side of the question, period.  And they don't want to hear anything else and they'll tell you that, you see?
R:  Okay.
L:  And I find that whenever they take that attitude, I have a problem with them, uh, not in them doing their work, but um, I can only put them to do just one thing and they do that one thing well --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but they can't do anything else, and I guess that also is a -- um, oh, I'm seeing another part of that, too, in that if you could only do one thing well, in this computer age, things change so quickly --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that sooner or later, that one thing you can do well, let's say two or three years down the road --
R:  It's obsolete.
L:  That's right.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  And --
R:  And then where are you?  [LAUGH].
L:  That's right.  And let's say you're twenty four, twenty five, at twenty seven, suddenly --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you're out of the workforce and you have a family, you have a problem. 
R:  Right.  
L:  And then you have to go back to school and very few people uh believe in continuing education.  And that is one thing that schools are starting to teach, and the colleges, they are starting to stress it.  They don't stress it from the first year, which I think they should, but they start stressing in the senior year.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they encourage you to put together a network of people to help you, um, what shall I say, find jobs, if you don't do that continuing education.  But they do tell you it's necessary.  
R:  Right.
L:  But out there in the work world, let me tell you, if you're a professional person, you know it's necessary, but how many people are professionals?  You see?  That's the thing, so um being well rounded, at least you'll see another part of it.  You may not -- uh, it may not, uh, impress you every time, let's put it like that.
R:  Right [LAUGH].
L:  But what happens is, um, you'll get hung up sooner or later and if -- I don't -- you say you're in a rural area, right?
R:  Right.
L:  Uh, where I am, there's a lot of city streets, oh there's a lot of trees and all, but there are a lot of city streets, okay? 
R:  Uh-huh?
L:  And you can walk down the street and you will see people -- I'm not going to say they're living on the street, but they spend, out of twenty four hours, they'll spend twenty hours on the street.  Looking for a place to sleep.  And all this is because they don't have adequate skills.  And at some point, they uh just failed to keep up with the skills.  A lot of people will tell you, I'm glad to get out of school, and these are not people who have a high school diploma.  If they could leave at the sixth grade, they would.  Just as easy as that.
R:  Right.
L:  And it's pretty bad.  I mean, you know, now when you see that, oh, you feel sorry for them 'cause you know sooner or later the police are going to see them and take them to -- um, they have homes for people who insist on slipping -- sleeping on the street or in the subways.  They even sit on the buses and fall asleep.  Now, you don't say anything to the driver 'cause you -- you know, you feel sorry for them, but their problem is, um, they just couldn't keep up with their skills, and when you see that, you make -- you make the decision to yourself, "I will never let my skills go".  I'm telling you, I know how it sounds, but seeing that, you -- you do feel bad.  Now, you don't want it to be you.  Mm.
R:  Mm.
L:  Well, anyway, oh yeah, and there -- this business about, um -- and private schools, what happens is that um --
