R:  Hi.
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, this is Lisa.
L:  Hi, this is Simone.  I'm sorry, I didn't hear the topic, --
R:  Um, it's --
L:  -- 'cause my cell phone was breaking up.
R:  Oh, sorry.  It's whether or not we think public or private schools have the right to, um, not let students read certain books.
L:  [MN] Yeah, I think they should.  It should be like that.
R:  How come?
L:  Because certain books, I don't think some students, um, should read, because, you know, like, you know, like, if certain parents don't want them to read certain things --
R:  Right. 
L:  -- or, you know, it's based on religion, or you know what I'm saying?  Uh, or race of the student, if certain -- certain parents, you know what I'm saying, don't want them to read certain books and, then you have it in the library, and they can't read it at home, then you see what will happen, when they go to school and they can read it there, I'm pretty sure there'll be a lot of parents that'll be mad about it, so --
R:  Well, I understand what you're saying, and I -- I agree with you as to private schools, because I went to private school, and my parents put me there specifically so that the school could control, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but I really don't think that public schools should be allowed to do that, because I think they should have -- they should let anyone who wants to access anything access it.  They shouldn't force people, like you said, to read religious books, or force them to, uh, read things about racial or ethnics, but they should have it available.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  You know.  
L:  -- well, I -- um, you know, that -- that -- I agree with you with that, but also, it's, like, um, well, I'm saying, for certain students, I think, like, they should have, like, um, they would send, like, a paper home for the parents?
R:  Right.
L:  -- about certain books, w- what they want their par- -- you know what I'm saying, their students to read, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then, have it on their -- on cards.
R:  Yeah, no, that's fine.
L:  -- so they'd know they couldn't, you know, they couldn't take out certain books or they couldn't read certain books.  You know what I'm saying, unless they -- it's on their card that they could, you know --
R:  Right, unless parents give permission, well, that's fine, I agree wi- with you on that, but if the school says, "Well, you can't read this book at all", and the parents say, "Yes, they can", well, I don't think that's right, in a public school.
L:  Well, that's -- well, yeah, well, I agree with that, that's true.
R:  -- you know, in a public school, it is, it's supposed to be for everybody, like, private schools, sometimes you send your kids to private school 'cause they're really bad, or -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- you know, and you want them to be more disciplined, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, you know, as a parent, that's your choice because your child's under eighteen years old and it's your choice to, you know, control your children, but, you know, I don't think the school should say, "Well, we don't want you to read Dr. Seuss's Red Fish, Blue Fish, because, you know, ah, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- red fish are endangered species right now", you know, I think the parents should determine whether or not, you know, the child should read certain things, you know, like, --
L:  That's true.  That's true, I agree --
R:  -- so, I agree with you, like, sending home the letters and saying, you know, here's the books that are available, please check off the ones your child is allowed to read, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but they shouldn't say, well, we're going to take all these books out of school, or your kid brought to kindergarten, ah, for Show and Tell, brought his, um, oh, some -- maybe not a religious book, but like, maybe, um, I don't know, Country Mouse, City Mouse, or something, --
L:  [COUGH] But they don't -- they don't even have a lot of books in schools, really --
R:  Right.  
L:  -- I mean, a lot of those books that they have at schools, now, even if -- you know, when you get down to it, if they should read it or not, they don't even have it at schools and, I think they should start donating certain more -- you know, more people should donate more books --
R:  Right.  
L:  -- to the library at schools, because they don't really have much there, --
R:  Yeah, they don't have a big library.
L:  -- 'cause a lot of schools don't have it at all, really, and you know what I'm saying, you know, it's [inaudible] the budget so messed up every- everything --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they really can't get anything new.
R:  Right, no, you're right, that's everywhere, though, that's --
L:  Yeah that's everywhere, --
R:  Budget cuts everywhere --
L:  -- but I think everyone should chip in and actually start donating certain things, and -- you know what I'm saying?  That the schools should need --
R:  But what if people donate books, like, what if, um, somebody's a religious fanatic and he'd donate all these books, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then the school says, "Well, we don't want these kids reading these books".
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know, --
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- and I mean, it should be the parents, really, that say, "Well, we don't want you to read about this fanatical thing" -- 
L:  Yeah, always boils down to the parents, [inaudible] starts in the home, again --
R:  Right.  --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it's -- it's sad, because so many parents don't actually participate, you know, until, like, there's a big problem --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they don't get involved until there's a big issue, you know, but they should, it shouldn't be --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, what'd you say?
R:  No, I'm sorry, I said it shouldn't really be the school's choice, it should be, um, the parents' choice.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, we -- you're -- you're on your cell phone?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Can you hear?
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  Oh, 'cause I know -- I heard voices in the background, I wasn't sure if you could hear me.
L:  No, I can hear you, okay.
R:  Is this your first, is this your first survey?
L:  No, this is the second one I had.
R:  This is my third, th- they call in --
L:  [COUGH] Oh, this is your first one?
R:  No, it's my third one, they call every --
L:  Oh, your third one?
R:  -- every Monday night.  I'm surprised they called tonight, because of the holiday weekend, but, where I am, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it's so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- rainy that I didn't, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, didn't do nothing today, so --
L:  Yeah, I understand.
R:  So --
L:  -- but I totally agree with you on the topic, so, it's -- it's a pretty good topic, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I agree a hundred percent.
R:  But it's weird, like, you know, who -- but who would choose, like, you know, even if the school makes up a list and says, "Well, parental -- parental permission for these books", like, who in the school gets to choose, the principal, a librarian, the grade teacher, --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- you know, like, who would be allowed to determine what's good and what's not good?
L:  And usually they -- usually they don't -- a lot of parents don't participate in it, so they don't participate and then when you get to the point of asking them [NOISE] -- asking them, um, what they think, and it's, sort of like, [inaudible] they don't participate, so, when it comes down to it, somebody -- or their child brings something home, then they get mad, [COUGH] they get mad about the fact that they brought something there, --
R:  Yeah, but they have --
L:  But they never, --
R:  -- nobody to blame --
L:  -- but they never participate really.
R:  Right, so they have nobody to blame --
L:  You know what I'm saying?
R:  -- but themselves, it's like people who don't vote and then they say, well, I don't like what this mayor or this President, or this Governor did.  Well, you didn't vote, so [LAUGH] you didn't help to keep them out, you know what I mean?  Um, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You're right, it all comes down to participation.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  What was that?
L:  No, I'm just talking to someone, I'm sorry.  [LAUGH]
R:  That's okay.
L:  I'm talking on the phone and try to do everything at the same time. [inaudible]
R:  Do you have any kids?
L:  Huh?
R:  Do you have any kids?  Tell me [inaudible], how --
L:  Do I have kids, oh, yeah, I have three.
R:  How old are they?  
L:  Um, they're -- [NOISE] they're three, I have a three year old, a two year old and a six year old.  
R:  Oh.  Wow.  So the six year old must be going --
L:  So -- but I participate in -- I participate in everything --
R:  That's good --
L:  -- my oldest daughter, you know, goes to [inaudible] --
R:  Goes to school.  Did she ever get any lists where they banned books and stuff?
L:  Did they get what?
R:  Did she ever get a list to bring home where they said she can't read certain books?
L:  Yeah, yeah.  They brought them, I mean, she -- I mean, they had, like, a book day, they had, one time, where you actually buy the books.
R:  Right, the Fair Day.
L:  Huh?
R:  The Book Fair Day.
L:  Yeah, the Book Fair Day, yeah, they have that sort of stuff, so it's been pretty cool, --
R:  That's good.
L:  But, you know, she's just started, um, this year, so it's like, um, kindergarten, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so, there's a first thing for everything, and I try to participate in everything, as far as that's involved --
R:  Oh, that's good, you have to -- you have to be involved, because if you're not involved, like you said, --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- then you're not aware until after the fact there's a problem, you know, but --
L:  Exactly, exactly.
R:  Now, I remember when I was in school, and like I said my parents sent me to private school, not only did they ban books, but they told us we couldn't watch certain TV shows, they sent home a list and, they said, [inaudible] these are bad for children under the age of such and such, it's too much, --
L:  But who did they really know, because, see, every child is -- is different, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and every -- and, and some kids, you know, [inaudible] they learn faster than others, so, they can't really base that on -- on every child that they can't watch this, or they can't watch that.
R:  Right.
L:  Some children are a little bit more, um, uh, faster learners and quicker to think than others are.
R:  No, you're right, but I think it was more based on, like, what was violent or had sexual content, you know, and, -- 
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.
R:  So, they don't want, like, children of a certain age to see certain things, and, you know --
L:  Yeah, that's understandable, though.
R:  I mean, I guess, like, you know, if they were going to ban, like, something like, Playboy magazine, or something, from school, obviously, they don't sell that to minors, so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the school would have the right because it's the law, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, like, if it's a book that the school just decides on their own, well, we don't want you reading it, you know, like you said, it should definitely be up to the parent.
L:  Yes, that's true, that's true, that's true, that is definitely true.  Well, you know, I -- I -- I can't really, uh, argue with you a lot, 'cause you have a lot of good ideas, and stuff, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I agree with you! [LAUGH] A hundred per cent!
R:  [LAUGH] well, did you argue on the last topic?
L:  Oh, no, the other -- the first topic I, uh, agreed with that too.  I mean, there's been people that I spoke to -- this is the second, you're the second person, so, you ask a lot of, you know what I'm saying, said a lot of things, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I'm pretty sure I'm going to r- run into some [inaudible] people on the phone that are not going to agree with me.
R:  Yeah, you're going to be, like, screaming at each other, "No, I'm right!" -- "No, no, I'm right!" [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, so far, I got lucky, like, the people I spoke to, everybody's been, you know, they actually give you a chance to speak, and they listen, and, you know, they don't -- even if they don't agree what you say, they don't disrespect it, you know, it's just weird, 'cause when I first signed up for this, I thought it would be, like, a whole bunch of people talking at once, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- not just, like, one on one?
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, the first phone call I -- I -- I didn't even hardly talk, 'cause I got a guy and, he just did not shut up, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but I also was waiting for all the people to jump in, and it took me, like, a minute to realize, you know, that it was just the two of us, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but -- I mean, he had some good ideas, but his ideas were, like -- it was like he was so happy that they picked that topic, because he must have been, -- that must have been his topic in his life [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- 'cause he talked about it and talked about it and had an outline for it, --
L:  [MN] Where are -- where are you -- where are you from, anyway?
R:  I'm in -- I'm in New York, how about you?
L:  Oh, you're in New York?  Oh, what part of New York are you in?
R:  I'm in the Bronx.
L:  Oh, my gosh, I miss the Bronx!  I'm over here in Georgia.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  What part of Georgia?
L:  I'm in, ah, Plain County.
R:  Okay.  
L:  Yeah, that is, I've been down here for two years.  I miss the Bronx, how's everything going up there?
R:  Well, it's all right, it's just, ah, [LAUGH] it's really rainy up here, it's, it's --
L:  It's raining a lot?
R:  Yeah, this whole month of May has done nothing but rain, --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- I think we had two days of sunshine in the whole month, this whole weekend was a washout. Yesterday, it was only misty out, so I went to a barbecue, but --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- you know, today, yeah --
L:  -- and how about, I mean, what about the schools up there?
R:  The schools are, like, mm, [inaudible], there's, like, Mayor Bloomberg, Michael Bloomberg, I don't know if you have seen him in the news and stuff, --
R:  -- he, he's just, like, this rich businessman
