R:  Hi, my name is Doris.
L:  Hi, Laurie, I'm Jenny.  I couldn't -- I'm on a cell phone, I couldn't hear what the topic was.
R:  [SIGH] Um, [LIPSMACK] health and fitness, if --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- we exercise --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- or [NOISE] whatever. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, okay, well I don't --
R:  [SIGH] I'm not too good at that. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- exercise at all. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] I --
L:  [SIGH] When I get the feeling to exercise, I lay down till the feeling goes away. 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Well [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- [MN] [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- that's with me the b- [MN] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- most I do is walk to the store and I know I should do more but, um [NOISE] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but it just doesn't seem to work out that way. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I mean, I walk around a lot at work and I'm up and down the stairs in the house a lot but [SIGH] I don't make it like a -- a specific --
R:  A regular --
L:  -- routine --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- or anything like that now --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and part of my reason is I get -- because I have osteoporosis and they say you can't do certain exercises and [SIGH] --
R:  [SIGH] You get what?
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] I mean, I think I can --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  I -- you can't do it -- like, you know, you're supposed to do certain exercises --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- but then, because you have osteoporosis I could break a bone, so --
R:  Oh. [SIGH] 
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] I'm very careful [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- about that.
R:  [SIGH] I c-
L:  But what do they want us to discuss, whether we think it's a good thing or a bad thing?
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  Or whether we don't do it or not?
R:  Just if we do it or a- and how we, you know, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] I mean I have a --
L:  [MN] How we do it.
R:  -- hard time thinking of something to say for ten minutes.  If it was somebody I knew --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I could talk all [LAUGH] 
L:  I know, I know.
R:  [LAUGH] [inaudible] 
L:  Well, basically, I mean, I know they say, like cardio vascular exercise is good, and -- and, you know, weight bearing exercise is good if you have osteoporosis and -- and I know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's what I should be doing, you know, but I -- I really slack off.
R:  [SIGH] Well, see, I got that fi- fibrominral- [MN] mal-
L:  Myalgia?
R:  Yeah, [SIGH] and they say --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- stretch and yeah, I sure can tell the difference when I'm through --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- stretching [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- 'cause it --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, it just pulls every muscle and --
L:  D-
R:  -- sometimes --
L:  Does it hurt when you do it, or [inaudible]?
R:  Oh, yes, I mean --
L:  It does?
R:  -- just -- just a stretch in the mornings it [SIGH] gets to you, but [NOISE] --
L:  All right.
R:  -- yeah, I should exercise regularly. [NOISE] 
L:  What is -- what's an exercise that they tell you to do?
R:  [SIGH] [NOISE] Just regular -- you know, it -- it seems so weird because, um, [SIGH] years ago I used to [MN] do exercise every day with Jack Malaine[?]. --
L:  Did you?
R:  Do you remember him when he was on TV? [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, my god, yes.
R:  Oh, yeah? [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm showing my age, but yes I do.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, but I --
L:  I remember him on TV.
R:  -- I used to exercise with him every morning after the kids would --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- go to school, I'd --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  -- spend that time and, [SIGH] you know, I do know I felt better [SIGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, but, uh --
L:  Well, I used to exercise to -- do you remember the Jane Fonda tapes?
R:  [MN] Oh, no, I haven't [SIGH] --
L:  Years ago Jane Fonda had tapes out.
R:  Oh. [SIGH] 
L:  And, uh, when I first started exercising I could only do very little and I was exhausted --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- and then gradually I got up to the advanced one and I have to say I did feel better and, you know, I'd lost a lot of inches and --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- yeah, I'd have more energy --
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  -- but I think my problem now is getting motivated to even begin.
R:  Me too, I mean, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's -- that's the biggest problem is getting out there to do it.  Now, if I could just, [SIGH] like, walk.  I used to walk back and forward to work, I mean, I never had a driver's license so I walked --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- all the time. [SIGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  Well, now it's getting a little harder to walk, and I hate to walk by myself. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Right, [NOISE] you know --
R:  [SIGH] You know, I want somebody there.
L:  -- they say a buddy system is good.  Right.
R:  Yeah. [SIGH] But, uh --
L:  [NOISE] Some kind of buddy system, like, or even talk on the cell phone, [LAUGH] and walk at the same time --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you don't realize how --
R:  [SIGH] I know I [MN] --
L:  Well, I -- I mean, like, I -- I try and get out like [inaudible] over the weekend I -- I -- you know, like, I try and make it my business to do something, [NOISE] like, I'll go to yard sales --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so that I'm in and out of the car and I'm walking around or [NOISE] -- you know, or --
R:  But --
L:  -- um, go in [inaudible] stores and --
R:  -- they try to tell me that -- [SIGH] that it doesn't do any good, uh, 'cause when I was working I used to work as --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a nurse's aid, [SIGH] and when I was working they said stopping and starting isn't good, you got to get --
L:  Really?
R:  -- out there and walk constantly, [SIGH] you know --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you can't stop and start all the --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- time but [SIGH] I thought, "Boy, I sure feel tired at the end of the day for saying it's no good". [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] So, you when you say you go out and walk, how much do you walk?
R:  [SIGH] Well, I used to try to walk a mile, but now I'm --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- lucky if I get half that done. [LAUGH] 
L:  Mm, [SIGH] but you do it, what?  A couple of times a week?
R:  [SIGH] [MN] Yeah [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- maybe --
L:  You don't [NOISE] --
R:  -- I mean, it just depends --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- on my mood --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I mean, I'm [SIGH] -- and how --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I'm feeling [MN] 'cause I know [NOISE] really, I guess, I just got to get it into my mind that [SIGH] I know if I do it --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- then I'll fell better --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- but it's just getting up the --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- gump to do it. [LAUGH] 
L:  And getting motivated. [MN] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Now that it's getting nicer out, yeah, it'll be easier because --
L:  Well, there's girls at my job --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- who exercise and what they do is they just walk around the floor.  They put their sneakers on at lunchtime and they'll walk around the -- the building floor, like, ten, fifteen times.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, yeah, at [MN] --
L:  And, um --
R:  -- at work too.
L:  -- and of course they're very skinny and very healthy and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- nutritionist and all that but --
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
L:  -- they say they feel better because they feel full after they eat --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- but, , um, I know I should exercise and -- and I really just don't. [NOISE] Just don't --
R:  I think we all --
L:  -- have any kind of routine and can't get myself motivated and --
R:  Yeah, I was going to --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- say I think we all have that problem, I mean, it's too easy to [SIGH] --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- let things go. [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, I know it is, it really is, but I -- I mean, I'm ashamed to say I'm forty seven years old and I'm not fit at all.
R:  Oh, me --
L:  You know, I just --
R:  -- me either, I mean, I'm -- I am fifty seven, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] and it's just -- really I am really upset with myself because, you know, it's just been the last ten years that I've really gained w- before I used to be between a hundred and fifteen and a hundred and twenty [SIGH] and now all of a sudden it's just seems like I vroom [MN] right up there. [LAUGH] 
L:  And do you -- you think it's a lack of exercise? [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] I think it's a lot of it, you know, I'm not --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I'm not doing what I used to --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and then they put me on disability so [SIGH] naturally I'm not even working any more, so that's a lot of just sitting there at ho- home.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, get --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- bored, eat a little bit, smoke a little bit and -- which is a bad habit to start, smoking. [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm. [SIGH] Yes, I know [NOISE] and then it's probably easier to just get in the car instead of -- you know, for me, I just get in the car and drive, where I could just walk and -- and I don't.
R:  Well, see, that was where I was kind of lucky in a way, 'cause I never did drive --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I -- I tried it once and [SIGH] I don't know, I got scared and I figured if I'm scared [MN] [SIGH] everybody else is safer if I'm off the road. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Oh.
R:  I mean --
L:  I even -- I know, I know. [NOISE] 
R:  But --
L:  But, oh, [SIGH] anyhow, gosh, I don't know what else to say --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I don't exercise properly and I don't know what to talk about.
R:  [SIGH] Really, [SIGH] I mean, I --
L:  [SIGH] Uh, you know, part of the reason I don't exercise also is 'cause I have asthma, and it's been --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you know, I -- they say, you know, do breathing treatment before you do exercise, but the exercise you do when you have asthma and when you have osteoporosis and plus I have osteoarthritis --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so all those things combined --
R:  Oh. [MN] 
L:  -- make it, like, very hard to even want to think about exercising 'cause you're in so much pain, the last thing you want to do is --
R:  I know --
L:  -- put your bones in more pain.
R:  -- and that's what really makes me feel bad right now is because [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [COUGH] I know when I was working as the nurse's aid, they -- we'd have to go give these people exercises and stuff --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and get 'em to --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- move and [SIGH] -- and I'd say --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- "Well, if you don't move it you're going to lose it" and now here I am doing the same thing they did, so [SIGH] you know, --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I feel bad because --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they -- I should --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- listen to my own advice. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] It's, like, you know what the right thing to do is, but you just don't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- do it.
R:  [SIGH] But, uh, it's --
L:  Yeah, and that's like --
R:  -- get out there and --
L:  -- [NOISE] I'm in my car right now driving home --
R:  --Oh.
L:  -- I just -- and I just broke my foot. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, gee. [LAUGH] 
L:  So, they gave me crutches and everything, so I'm like, "Okay, yeah, now --"
R:  [MN] 
L:  "-- what exercise do I do?"
R:  Yeah.
L:  What a topic they gave us. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, really. [LAUGH] [SIGH] But it --
L:  [SIGH] But try and [NOISE] --
R:  I mean, and you buy the exercise equipment, I --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- see all this on--
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- TV and in fact I did, I bought, um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- what is it?  This bicycle --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and, um, a whole --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- a couple of different --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- things, a walker --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and all this --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and that --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  -- and what's the sense --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- of spending all that money when I didn't, you know -- maybe I'd try it for a couple of days and then after that it'd just sit there. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 'Cause it hurt too much? [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] You get that exercise pain, and you're like, "Oh, god, I --" like I said [MN] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when I get the feeling to exercise I just sit down till the feeling goes away.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] It's just what I do, it's, like, horrible when I'm -- and, like I said, at my age I should be doing it --
R:  Yeah, [MN] and --
L:  -- and -- but --
R:  -- I have been trying in the mornings now to --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] I figure, like, if I get up and start something then maybe I'll feel better during the day and which --
L:  [NOISE] When you start walking do you feel better though?
R:  Oh, y- I'm really tired after I walk --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- I mean, it just feels like it takes everything I've got --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- to even lift my feet up to walk --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- but once I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- get home and all that blood gas is circulating --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- then it's not too bad. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right, right. [NOISE] 
R:  I mean, [SIGH] it's just getting -- getting it done. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, right now, I'm getting to the point where [SIGH] if I want to walk to the store I think, "Am I going to make it without, you know, my legs giving out on me?" [LAUGH] 
L:  Yes, I know.
R:  [SIGH] I got a -- [SIGH] I got a neph- I should thank god, though, because I got a nephew that's, um, [SIGH] in his early -- oh, oh, late twenties and he's already in a wheelchair because of this. [SIGH] 
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, and --
L:  Do they have him doing exercises in the wheelchair?
R:  Oh, yeah, I mean, they have him get up and they try to get him to walk but, see, he can't walk very far at all any more --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean, it's just -- uh, your muscles -- it's kinda like, um, [LIPSMACK] oh, what do you call it?  Oh, what's that -- that [MN], um -- MS?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE]
