R:  Hi, I'm Shirley. 
L:  Hi, I'm Margarite.  How are you?
R:  I'm fine. 
L:  [SIGH] Well, no, I don't re- -- exercise regularly and I know I should and I think real hard about it, but I don't do it. [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't either. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.  I bought a bicycle the other day and --
R:  Yeah, I have one of --
L:  -- now, I put out all this money I have to do it.  But it's been raining every day since, so ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  I have a stationary down the basement that's been collecting dust for a while.
L:  I find that they're very useful for holding clothes. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's what mine does. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  God. 
R:  Ah, yeah, I can -- ah, I tried walking a little bit for, ah, lowering blood pressure, that kinda helped, but haven't even really stuck with that [SIGH]. 
L:  Well, in -- in fact I was just sitting around here wondering today, why don't I stick with anything?  And I don't know.  I mean --
R:  Well --
L:  -- I get busy, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the next day or two, I'm not busy so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't know.  There's such wonderful benefits, I don't know why I don't do it.
R:  Well, you -- y- you'd probably stick better with it if you had somebody, like, walking -- to walk with, or ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  That makes it a lot more fun.  
L:  Somebody calls and [several inaudible words] yeah.  Yeah, and I don't.  I don't have anybody to go out [COUGH] and walk with or ride a bike with.  Um, oh, actually we do have a bike club here but -- and I think it's for beginning women, but I haven't contacted 'em yet.  That would be good. 
R:  Yeah, yeah.  We live in a rural area and I -- up a canyon and it's fine going downhill but coming back uphill's --
L:  Oh, God.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's what cars are for. 
R:  Right. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, but I -- I don't know. 
L:  And if you're near a canyon, it's probably hot all the time.
R:  Ah, no.  It's not too bad.  It's hot today, I've been looking for shelter and shade, but --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- I got a little exercises -- like, I did, ah, some thinning this morning on some nectarine trees, so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that oughta burn a calorie or two. 
L:  Well, I'm in the middle of allergy hell here.  I mean, we are the pollen center of the U.S. they tell us.  
R:  Where are you at?
L:  I'm in Kentucky. 
R:  Oh, I'm in Washington.
L:  So, ah, when I bought this house, I thought, "Oh, yeah, I'll get out here and I'll garden and I'll do this and I'll do that".  And, well, you know, the first week of sneezing all week, I said, "I don't think this is going to work".  So I don't even garden any more. 
R:  I got a big garden.  Get some exercise there. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  But for, I guess, for the -- the fitness junk, [MN] I used to do water aerobics, but that requires driving into town every time you wanna go.
L:  Yeah, and then you're wet when you get out of there. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, they usually had showers and you could --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- get dried off and stuff, but -- and -- I -- I liked that for a while, but I don't know why I dropped that. 
L:  Well, I enjoyed it too.  I had it -- I think I took it twice over here.  And I don't remember now why I didn't finish.  Or maybe I finished and that was the end of the class.  I don't know. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  But it --
R:  Yeah, a lot of times -- a lot of times you start something like that and the funding or whatever runs out at [several inaudible words] we had to pay a fee, a little bit of a fee, but, ah, there for a while they were going to shut down all the public swimming schools around here, because they wanted more tax money and --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- they felt that was a good way to -- to threaten people, but, ah, I feel the pools are still open, so ... [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, I'm close to a university so, you know, they're all the time offering stuff like that.  Of course you have to pay for it.  But they don't threaten to cut -- cut back like that.  
R:  Well, this --
L:  Although actually our city has cut back on some of the swimming pool services to the public.  
R:  Oh.
L:  It's bad all over.  
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Yeah, our state passed that law that took away a lot of their tax money and boy, they really been sucking into people where they know it will hurt the worst. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And keeping with us, you know, and it's amazing what -- what our -- ah, one little old tax will support.  I mean, it looks like it was supporting the whole -- whole state.  [LAUGH] But, ah --
L:  I don't -- I don't understand the economy. 
R:  Well, see, we had a -- a excise[?] tax on our car licenses.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Well, we -- we appealed that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and we just play it -- pay a flat, ah, I think it's thirty three dollars for a license plate regardless of what you've got and, ah, now every entity that is supported by taxes is screaming and saying that they've lost all their income.  Well, that one little old tax couldn't have been supporting all that.  If it was --
L:  No. 
R:  -- where have all the other tax money go?  You know?
L:  Well, no.  I was talking to a friend of mine the other day.  I said, "Now, you and I -- I understand you and I have to balance up at [inaudible] and we deal in cash and we can't spend more that we have, or we go into debt blah blah blah".
R:  Mhm.
L:  But there's something about the federal government that they don't have to follow those rules.  And I don't understand how they don't have to follow those same kind of rules.  And imagine if [inaudible] it's bad for state governments as well as federal.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] Oh, well. [SIGH]
R:  That was one of the places they started hitting was the, you know, the swimming pools so the people that were doing exercises and stuff that way, you know, couldn't, they were going to shut the pool down, so they couldn't do that and ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they were going to close parks where they rode bikes and walked and all that good fun stuff.  And --
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  So ...
L:  [SIGH] And that's the services that you all need, I'm sure.  We need 'em here.  
R:  Yeah.  But I don't know, they -- there's always I guess some place to do some exercise if you really wanna exercise, but ... [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, my -- my grandmother always said, "Well, it's not crowded walking.  You get out here and walk".
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I don't want to. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I don't think that's probably --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- what -- what it boils down to when you don't --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you don't exercise because you really don't want to.
L:  I really don't want to.  I'd rather sit on the couch and watch T.V. 
R:  [COUGH] [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, funny how that works.  
R:  Mm.
L:  [MN]
R:  Yeah --
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  But then if you don't do a little something, then you get so stoved[?] up you can't do what you wanna do and so ...
L:  That's right and you get all stiff and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I do feel better after I exercise, that's why I just don't understand why I don't keep it up. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um --
R:  And you get --
L:  -- I suspect we're kinda typical.  
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah. [PAUSE]
L:  I have a couple of friends who are really gung ho, you know, they take five hundred mile bike trips and work out at the gym two or three days a week and all this nonsense, but [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- not many of my friends are like that. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] Well, we got some family members that exercise quite -- well, not every day, but they try to get -- they go out in their lunch hour and walk or something like that or -- or go play, ah, racketball or --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But I don't -- I don't know any -- too many people that are [MN] dead, oh, having to be exercising twenty four hours a day.
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  I think -- I think the best exercise is just get out and do something, like, you know, work in your yard, work in your garden --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [inaudible] that way, you wo- -- you burn just as many calories and you use a few other muscles and --
L:  Now, sometimes I will try to park at the far end of the parking lot in the morning, so that I have to walk a little further.  I think that's really the best way to start, if you can get in the habit of doing those sorts of things. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But of course it if rains, there you are. 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  Or in a shopping mall or something like that.  That helps. 
R:  Yeah, that's -- a lot of people are going the shopping malls and just walk.
L:  I know.  They do that here too.  And some of these malls are so big, I can see where you get a mile or two in, just from one end to the other.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.  
R:  But there again, it's more fun to do it with somebody else, not just walk by yourself.
L:  Well, [MN] I think you should walk from one end to the other and then when you get to the end of it [LAUGH] you should go to Baskin Robbins --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and treat yourself, see.
R:  Ah, right.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  There you go.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, you worked it off beforehand, yeah.
R:  Yeah, I don't --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- don't think that works quite the way it --
L:  Mm, no.
R:  -- you want it to, but --
L:  No.
R:  -- it sounds good. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I don't think my doctor would approve at all.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH] Well, they -- they say we're supposed to talk about exercise, they didn't say wheth- -- how we rewarded ourself after the exercise. [LAUGH] 
L:  That's right.  That's right. 
R:  [SIGH] Oh. [LAUGH] Mm.
L:  I think this is my third or fourth call with them.
R:  Ah, this is my third.  I -- I've been instigating them because they always call me when I'm gone. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Ah, they called me yesterday and I was gone.  I never even gave it a thought about it on Memorial Day, you know, I'd get a call and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- then I waited up till -- well --
