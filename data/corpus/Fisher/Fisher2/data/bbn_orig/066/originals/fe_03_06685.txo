R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, th- -- my name's Diane from Ohio. 
R:  Oh, hi, I'm Kathleen.  I'm from Oregon. 
L:  Oh, a long way away. 
R:  Yeah, that is. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, this is kinda interesting. 
L:  Yes, it is.  Um, the subject was the health and fitness --
R:  Right --
L:  -- and --
R:  -- exer- -- yes.
L:  Do you -- do you exercise?
R:  I do exercise.  Um, I, ah, in the mornings I try to -- most mornings, I mean there are some mornings I don't get up in time, but most mornings I do get up and I stretch, I like to do yoga stretches, and then I try and go out, ah, for a walk.  I like to take, like, a ten, fifteen minute walk. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, those -- those are the kind of constants that I do on a daily basis.  How about yourself?
L:  Ah, myself, ah, normally about four days a week I run.  
R:  Ah.
L:  And I -- I run on a treadmill, um, in our basement.  Have been running for about a year and have been walking on the treadmill -- I'm on my second treadmill, so, um, a good twelve years. 
R:  Wow.  That's really cool because I really don't, um -- it seems like so many people that get treadmills don't use 'em.  They land up selling them --
L:  Well, and I know --
R:   -- so that's interesting to see -- to hear somebody that's using theirs.
L:  Right, like I said, my other one burned up and last July we got a new one and [LAUGH] so ...
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm giving it a work out also.
R:  Wow, that is great.  Now, are there, like, um [LIPSMACK] -- there are other types of ways that I exercise, but those are kind of seasonal.  Do you have any of those?
L:  Um, no, not really.  I -- I just use that treadmill all the time.  'Course, you know, in the summer try to get out as much as I can and, you know, just do outdoor things. 
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 
L:  But, um, started -- like I said, started walking and then graduated up to running. [LAUGH] 
R:  Ah, okay, okay.  Yeah, in the summ- -- wintertime we like to ski.  I do tail mark[?] skiing.  And so try and do that in the wintertime and then what I want to start doing in the summer, I kinda did a little bit last summer, I want to get, um, get into more this summer, is, um, to rollerblade, 'cause I feel like, um, rollerblading will make me stronger for skiing. 
L:  I think -- I'm sure it will.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, so that's, ah, kind of what I'm hoping to do, and then I also -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [MN] I'm in Oregon, so we get, you know, I'm kind of like -- we're an hour away from the coast, so lot of rain in the wintertime but, um, usually I do try and ride my bike to work and it's not really very far, it's just a few blocks, but, ah, sometimes I'll do errands on my bike also.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  And, um, so then that kind of gets me out and exercising and then of course there's, like, yard work and that type of thing and --
L:  Right, I do those types of things also.  Um, I used to have a bicycle and used to like riding and kind of got away from it.  
R:  Ah, interesting.  Yeah, I got a -- a recumbent bicycle.  The kind that -- I don't -- do you know what those are?
L:  Um, is that a stationary?
R:  No, no, no.  It's -- it's a bicycle, but it's the kind that has, like, a seat.  It's not -- it's not an upright.  You, like, sit down in it.  You --
L:  Oh, no. 
R:  -- sit back.  Oh, okay.  Well, I got one of those --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just, um, because I think the seats are just so much more comfortable. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  In the upright, I mean, I was -- it's just -- it was really hard for me --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to keep riding an upright.  And so I really like this recumbent bike and, um, um, it's just -- it's easier to use, I find myself doing a little bit more bike riding.  Um, I'm not easier -- it's not easier to use, it's more comfortable to use, yeah.
L:  Well, we live in the country, so it's kinda hard to ride a bicycle out here.
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, if I were in town I think it would be a lot easier, but being in the country, it's -- it's a little more difficult.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it was also the same thing with trying to walk outside, because you have to walk down the highway.  And, um --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- that's why, um, [MN] I originally got the treadmill, it's just was much easier.
R:  Oh, interesting, interesting.  Now, do you -- have you run, um, like, outside besides the treadmill?  Have you tried running, like, on [inaudible] trails or on the street or ...?
L:  I have when we've been on vacation and things already, um, different places we would find trails and run on 'em.   And we were in, ah, Arizona and -- in, um, [LIPSMACK] April and my husband and I climbed, um, Camel Back Mountain while we were there. 
R:  Oh.
L:  So that gave us a little bit of exercise. 
R:  Oh, that's great.  Yeah.  The reason I was asking is 'cause I -- I have -- myself don't like running -- I love to walk and there is a place here in Bald Hill[?], it takes, like, about, oh, I guess half an hour to forty five minutes to walk and once a week I try and get up there early in the morning and climb that, because that really gets my heart beating.  But, um, do you find it different running on a treadmill as opposed to running on trails or running, you know, without the treadmill running?
L:  I don't really find it that much different.  Um, unless it's an uneven trail.  Um, now when we climbed that mountain, of course we were going up rocks and things like that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and there was a lady that was -- was running it.  She lived locally and she said she ran it six days a week. 
R:  Six days a week? [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] She climbed that mountain or ran it six days a week. 
R:  Wow.
L:  But she was an -- obviously in excellent shape.
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 
L:  And, um, well, we wanted to see if we could do it, and it was, you know, it was pretty easy really.
R:  I --
L:  So the -- the running has helped a lot? 
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  [MN] Gives you good lung capacity.  
R:  Right, right.  Yeah, I think that's one of the things I'm interested about in keeping fit, is, um, you know, I wanna have that lung capacity.  I want my muscles to -- to last for a long time too.  You know, when I get to be an older person --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't want to have to rely on, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, wheelchairs or walking aids, or going to a nursing home or whatever, I wanna be able to, um, move around under my own power as long as I can, so ...
L:  Exactly.  Well, I'm fifty eight and soon will be fifty nine, and the heart doctor said I'm in great shape. [LAUGH] So ...
R:  Wow. 
L:  He says, "Just keep it up". [LAUGH] 
R:  Wow. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That is cool.  Um, and how long do you run for -- or how much -- how long are you on the treadmill?
L:  Um, I do -- always do several mile --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- at a time. And then, you know, some days longer and some days less, you know.  But I try to do it four days a week. 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I -- I do Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday off and then Thursday and Friday.  So, and if I just keep up that, though like I said, the heart doctor said that that was great.
R:  Okay.  Wow, so now, when you're -- when you're running, do you get your heart rate up to -- does your treadmill kinda measure your heart rate --
L:  It does, it -- it --
R:  But do you try and, like, get to a certain s- stage and stay there, or ...?
L:  Well, I try to get up to a certain stage is where the doctor told me to get it, and so to get it -- yes, you have to keep it up there for awhile.  For twenty minutes is what they told me.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So, um, which means you have to keep running at a constant pace.
R:  Huh.
L:  So that's what I do.  But it does measure, it measures, um, [LIPSMACK] pulse and your heart rate and it actually has programs that are actually -- you can just push a program and it'll -- it does, um, climbing and all kinds of different kinds of things on it. 
R:  Interesting, interesting. 
L:  So, do you, um, exercise with anyone?
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] not usually.  Sometimes -- my partner is a runner and he likes to run and sometimes I'll run with him.  And, um, for a while when I was climbing Bald Hill, I had a friend that would climb with me, but she doesn't do it any more.  So usually it's by myself. 
L:  Mhm.  
R:  And --
L:  And how high is Bald Hill?
R:  Oh, jeeze, that's a good question.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  'Cause I know it's straight up and -- and I'll climb it for a half an hour and it's just kinda straight up, but there -- there is a trail, so it's not like I'm winding back and forth -- I'm able to kinda just go -- it's, you know, not a steep, steep mountain, so I'm able to go just straight up it.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  I don't know.  It's a few hundred feet, I'm sure, but I don't know how many.  Mm. 
L:  Yeah --
R:  That would be a good statistic for me to try and --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- figure out. 
L:  Well, that mountain we climbed was, like, seventy five hundred feet.  
R:  Wow.  
L:  And, um, we -- we kept looking at it from our patio -- balcony each day a- and finally my husband say, "You want to?" and I'm like, "Yes, let's do it".  [LAUGH] 
R:  How long did it take you?
L:  It took us, um, less than an hour. 
R:  Wow. 
L:  It -- it didn't ta- -- we had to walk a mile to get to the base of it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You have to walk a mile uphill to get to the base of it and then it's just kinda straight up over rocks and things and wome- -- there were lots of people doing it, going, and then lots of people going up and lots of people coming down.  But it was something we wanted to see, if, you know, we were in good enough shape to do and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- it was no problem.  
R:  Oh, wow, that's pretty interesting.  So now, when you were walking -- the reason I'm asking you all these questions is because I'm -- as I'm listening to you, I'm thinking, you know, I may not be walking long enough or fast enough, 'cause I know, I don't think my heart, you know, when I'm just walking on flat surfaces, I'm -- in -- 'cause the high school has a, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, where they do their sports activity --
L:  Right, mhm.
R:  -- what are those things called?  Anyway, you can go around and around it and so I can walk from --
L:  The track?
R:  -- yeah, the track and I -- as I can walk around and around and around it, but now I'm wondering if I'm actually walking fast enough.  So when you were walking on the treadmill, did you -- did your doctor have a heart rate he wanted you to get up to while you were walking?
L:  The doctor told me to start out walking, like, four mile an hour.  
R:  A mile an hour?
L:  Four mile and isle -- an hour.
R:  Oh, four miles an hour.
L:  Four miles an hour.
R:  Ah --
L:  To get the heart up.  Now that's a pretty fast pace.
R:  Okay, you know what?  I'm going to measure myself 'cause I know it's so many revolutions around there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, I'm glad I'm talking to you. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] The things we find out, huh? [LAUGH] 
R:  That's true, that's true, yeah, 'cause on these tracks it's really easy to know how many times around is a mile and so, um, I'm going to measure myself.  See how long -- how long was it taking you to -- oh, and you would walk for an hour and do four miles --
L:  Four mile. 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I get it, huh. 
L:  And that, like I said, that was at a pretty -- pretty fast pace. 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, to work up a sweat. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
