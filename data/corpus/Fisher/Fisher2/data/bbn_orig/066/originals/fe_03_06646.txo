L:  hello?
R:  Hello.  I'm Madeline.
L:  I'm Marjory.  I'm in New York.
R:  I'm in Iowa.
L:  Ah, I've never been to your state.
R:  And I not to New York either.
L:  Okay.  Uh, we should get to the point here.
R:  Okay.
L:  Censorship.  Um, I'm -- I'm -- I'm pretty -- I'm pretty much an absolutist against it.  I -- I can't imagine any circumstances in which I think censorship of text in schools is a good idea.  How about you?
R:  I agree with you.  I teach and um one of the things that bothers me very much about the -- about censorship, even in the times when it's supposed to be very patriotic to be very -- to censor things, is that um, you know, the -- the -- when you start banning the -- the exchange of free ideas, I think that's the most dangerous thing we can do.  So, um, that -- that's something I find very bothersome, when someone insists that that's a very patriotic, a very sensible thing to do.
L:  Oh, so there's -- yeah, patriotism and censorship, I think there is -- they're in some people's minds.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  I hate it --
L:  Okay, I was going to make this interesting for the listeners.  [LAUGH].  
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I think we're both on the same --
R:  [LAUGH].  Well [inaudible].
L:  [LAUGH].  Um -- I -- I -- I -- I went to school such a long time ago and er -- you know, like in the -- in the fifties and sixties and it -- I -- I -- I  -- I -- I -- we as students, we -- we had a censor -- things were censored, but I don't think anybody would admit to it.  The strange thing has happened over time is that people are actually proud of censoring materials.
R:  Yes.  I agree with you.  I think it's a very unusual turn of events, that um, you know, that they're very proud of, um -- well, them suppressing it for your own good, or "I'm suppressing it to make people feel better".  [LAUGH].  I -- I found that a very odd argument, but I'm -- I'm -- I agree with you.  I think it's a very intelligent point you raise, and I'm history's always been -- and events have always been sanitized, so to speak, or -- or put down -- or you know, carefully cleaned up, but uh, I guess maybe that -- that's one thing, too, that people have been -- the fact that it's more, um, at least it's more open, that that's being done.  At least then people are aware of it to some extent.  I find it bothers me when -- I shouldn't say -- when -- when I was talking about the uh, my classes, where the kids, uh, are -- I want them to be aware of the fact that someone can get a list of your library books, for instance, and um, you know, something else, or uh, at least be aware of what you're reading, even if they're not trying to actually censor anything.  Some of the kids are very complacent.  They don't mind at all.  They think that's a very good idea and I find that very scary.  [LAUGH].
L:  Does it affect the things that they take out of the library?  Like, they might get caught reading a dirty book?
R:  Well, right now, the -- the -- wh- I'm doing the homework security acts, they're -- the list of what you and I read at a public library are available to anyone in the government.  
L:  Oh, wow.  Oh.  Wow.
R:  And I've -- and that's not exactly censorship, that's uh, a little bit off the -- off angle, but it does -- it does bother me.  They're not proposing to re- remove books, um, the idea there is that they're, you know, trying -- trying to look up how to make a bomb or something, that would be available, but on the other hand, that led -- leads me toward that -- that idea of, well, maybe this isn't a good thing to have in a librarian, that sort of thing, and I do know that still goes on.  
L:  Uh.  And people, if they're going to borrow a book, I mean, it leads to all -- all kinds of [LAUGH] you know, it's anonymous.  I mean, people are going to be borrowing library books under -- you getting false identity so you can take a book out of the library.
R:  Yeah, in the [inaudible] and I -- of course, and I do know that they're -- you know, even our own school system, it's really -- they simply use -- I guess I would say some kind of commonsense about what is, uh, um, you know, if -- if a book is, you know, like pornographic and so on, it -- it won't be -- it won't be in our library, but I guess in a way that's a censorship, but I think that's more an age related -- it doesn't mean the kids can't get -- you know, can't get access to books, it just means they're not there during public school time.
L:  Right.  They might even be in their parents' library.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].  True.  [LAUGH].  I -- they are carrying around the paperback copies of some of the great books that -- that many censoring parents would be delighted to have [LAUGH] out of the library. 
L:  [LAUGH].  But they -- I -- I think -- [LAUGH] I was intrigued by your point about the -- or I guess the word -- the use of the word "open".  I mean, how -- how has this come about and we can blame various, you know, government administrations, but there's been another cultural ch- change that -- that people still of -- of, um, uh -- the things that you might want to censor being out in the open and people blurt out, uh, uh, extreme political opinions, people are certainly much more upfront about sexual matters and --
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  -- and the culturists.  I mean, I don't know if this is true in Iowa, but --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- the -- the -- the advertising --
R:  Yeah, it is.  [LAUGH].
L:  -- on the -- on the -- you know, on billboards, for example, and I know women of my generation who are, you know, deeply offended.  I don't think they're in favor of censoring them, but you know, oh, what our times have come to, sort of.  On the one hand because the culture is more open, there's also a demand to close it down harder.  I mean, how --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- how -- it's very strange.  And --
R:  Yes, it's a pendulum effect, I think, and the -- the call for censorship and -- at some point or other will -- will be, um -- I'm not too sure whether we'll mind it as much as when it's concerned with things like profanity and explicit sex and so on, because it's very hard to stand in the school classroom and tell kids not to use certain language and so on, and there it is on television and it's in the newspaper, the very language that I'll -- I'm -- you know, telling them not -- "No, you must do -- you mustn't use it", don't use [LAUGH] language and there it is on the television or -- or in a newspaper or in an -- in a magazine that you can pick up at any point.  Uh, either they -- I guess they -- you know, in the sense I am certainly trying to censor some of their [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  
R:  [LAUGH].  You could say avidly trying to censor some of it.  [LAUGH].  
L:  Well, is it exciting -- now you see once again, looking back to the golden age when I went to school, which it wasn't, the um, um -- uh, because those -- I mean, those words weren't on television.  I mean, they're -- you know, they --
R:  No.
L:  -- they -- you know, it was all hidden in the culture and so there was a special um, um, uh, pleasure actually --
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  -- in, you know, like uttering your first curse words.
R:  Yes.
L:  And um --
R:  I know, really, some of them use it so much that it's um -- it's almost um -- it's banal.  I mean, they don't even realize they -- you'll say, "Don't use that" and they'll say, "What?  What did I say?"  You know?  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] I mean, no -- nobody censors it at home and you know, "crap" is a very acceptable word.  It's like "hello".  [LAUGH].  
L:  Oh, that's --
R:  I guess I'm consciousness raising as well.  I don't know if it's censoring [LAUGH]  but I'm just defining what acceptable is.
L:  Oh, that is interesting, and I -- I -- actually, I mean, in order to -- and it's a censorship actually plays a role in our understanding what's, um, what's acceptable and what isn't or it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it -- and whether that's a sinister --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- role or I -- I -- it's uh -- I guess we both agree that it is.
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  But uh -- I we- and it's hard for me to imagine anybody who's on this um -- whatever it is, this party line telephone game --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- is -- is -- is on the other side, but you never know.
R:  Yeah, that's true.  That is interesting.  Mm.  And I guess part of it, too, I -- I find the reaction when I -- we -- we -- I teach Huck Finn every year and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- um, or I teach parts of it, I should say, we don't get time for the whole novel and I carefully explain to the kids why the objection is, you know --
L:  How old are your students?
R:  Um, that some parents, um, people feel it's a very -- it's a terrible novel because it uses the word "nigger" in it and -- and I try to explain to them that by the time you've finished it, you don't feel as -- as Huck does.  You couldn't possibly feel something black as a -- that person was a nigger, but I explain to them why people want to censor it and why they won't take it off the shelf.  Because sometimes kids have a little trouble with that.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Understanding the why.  
L:  Yeah.  I'm sorry -- I actually do.  How old are your students?
R:  Uh, they're high school students.  They range from, um, ninth to twelfth grade.
L:  Right.  That's when you read Huck Finn.
R:  Mm.
L:  Either because it's assigned, or for pleasure, and um uh -- it -- it's -- it -- it is -- does it -- they -- they -- the curriculum that you're given to teach, do you -- uh, do you feel that that's been uh, uh, you know, uh -- what, sort of whitewashed before you get it?
R:  No, not really because we're a part of the process of writing it and if it were, it would do no good to whitewash it.  I would be ignoring it anyway.  [LAUGH]. 
L:  [LAUGH]. 
R:  Um, the cen- I -- I'm -- I have very strong feelings about censorship, as you, from comments you're making, that I -- I don't think the -- I think the ex- exchange of ideas just has to be there and um, you know, if I -- I express my view that it's not acceptable to, um, my particular administration at the time, I simply make the point that that is my opinion and I respect it -- I re- respect theirs, um, they -- we need to respect each other's opinions, whether or not this is what someone wants, this -- this is what I think and then I won't grade them in any way that would be pejorative because of that, neither would I expect them to laugh at me or to interrupt me while I was ex- you know, expressing mine.  That's kind of the -- again, back to that trying to get a free exchange of ideas going.  
L:  Yeah.  And -- and -- in Iowa, I -- I -- I -- I guess Iowa's by reputation, it's kind of a mixed state.  There are a lot -- there is, like, conservative and a liberal -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- kind of --
R:  Individual.
L:  -- thing going on, about --
R:  It's very interesting to hear kids debating this subject and most of them um, you know, the most of them as the war situation came on, um, were -- were very willing to accept any kind of censorship or any kind of um -- any kind of government restrictions or any kind of um anything that sounded patriotic for the good of the cause thing.  And I -- and I was trying to -- I -- I tried to walk a fine line between um -- I -- I -- what I think in the military individual soldiers activities were commendable, I didn't uh -- didn't necessarily agree with our particular part in the war and so I tried to explain to them that we were -- you know, that uh, it was the fact that we were in a free country that allowed us to do that kind of debating, um, uncensored so to speak, so and I tried to get them to think about the -- you know, the fact that maybe, just maybe, uh, you should be very careful --
