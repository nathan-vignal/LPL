R:  Hi, I'm Vanessa.
L:  Hi, I'm Melanie.
R:  Hi, nice to meet you.
L:  You, too.
R:  Um, so um, what do you think?  Do you think that schools should be allowed to restrict reading?
L:  No, I don't think they should be able to.  There's a lot of good books that they've been censoring here lately that I don't understand why they're censoring 'em.  [LAUGH].
R:  It is funny, it's a funny issue, um, and it -- it seems like a lot of books have made the banned book lists that are -- that seem pretty harmless.
L:  A lot of them are considered classics, too.  You know?
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  And stuff that I read when I was in school and I enjoyed 'em and --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].  Things like, um, I guess the Outsiders and some of the other ones that are definitely --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- great books for teenagers to read.
L:  There's one -- um, there's one I can't remember the name of that I really, really liked.  That's sad.  I must of liked it a lot, I can't remember [LAUGH] the name of it.
R:  Mm.
L:  [LAUGH].  Um, gosh.
R:  Do you -- I -- ah --
L:  It was by the guy -- John Steinbeck.
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  Yeah, um great [inaudible] and, um, Of Mice and Men.  That's what it was.
R:  Of Mice and Men was a -- was a great book.  Actually --
L:  I loved that book and they just recently banned it.
R:  I -- I think it's been banned -- it's been on and off the lists over the years.  I -- I think it -- it sort of -- a lot of these books, it's sort of -- it's like a fad.  They're banned or they're not banned and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  But it seems like a lot of, um, groups use the banning of books to sort of draw attention to themselves.  Whether they really object to the books or not, it seems --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like a kind of a publicity ploy.
L:  Mhm.
R:  In a certain way.  Um, I don't think that books should be banned.  I do think that parents should be allowed to restrict the reading material of their kids themselves, if they want to, though.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I agree with that.  
R:  So --
L:  But -- 
R:  And, um, I'm wondering, what do you think of um banning books for -- usually books are banned because they have some kind of sexual content.
L:  Right.
R:  But what about if they had violent content? 
L:  No.  
R:  Still wouldn't ban 'em?
L:  No.
R:  Yeah, I guess -- I guess they wouldn't be there 'cause most of the -- I mean, I guess we're talking about high school reading, where it's not like --
L:  There's violence in the Bible.  
R:  Mm, that's true.
L:  You know?  But I mean, for me, that's my point, you know?  It's gonna be found everywhere.  I don't think you should make an effort to expose your children to it, but I don't think that it should be something that you go to great strides to shelter them from either.
R:  Mm.  I don't know, and I guess -- I think that -- that -- I mean, one of the issues with books is that if you -- if you watch a movie, for instance, you have -- you sort of live with the violence or whatever the content is for two hours.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then it's sort of gone in a certain way, but with books, you live with that book.  It's like you live in that book for -- for the duration of -- of the time you're reading it, so it's like you're living that book for two weeks or three weeks.  Which is what makes, you know, reading so much -- so powerful.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  And so I mean --
L:  Well --
R:  -- I guess -- I mean, I don't think that schools should restrict it -- I don't think -- I don't think it's the job of schools to -- to censor reading materials.
L:  No, I think it should be up to the parents.
R:  But I do think that there are certain -- I mean, I do think it's an issue that -- that parents should be aware of, and that people shouldn't in general be aware of --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- not -- that said, I don't think Of Mice and Men should [LAUGH] go on the restrict books list.
L:  No.
R:  Even though it does -- it is sort of violent, but um, yeah.  I would agree.  I mean, it -- it's going to be kind of hard for us to have a conversation about this, because we agree.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  It is.  [LAUGH].  Ah.  
R:  Huh.
L:  All we can do is -- yeah, uh-huh, I agree with you.  
R:  [LAUGH].  So um --
L:  I've got really no argument there.
R:  -- did you -- where -- wherever you went to high school, did -- did they ban books or did they send notices home to your parents or did they do any of that?
L:  I don't remember 'em ever doing it, actually, but -- I don't know.  I --
R:  How long ago were you in --
L:  -- really just read whatever I was reading at the time.  We didn't really have a lot of books that were assigned to the class to read.
R:  Not even in your English class? 
L:  We had, um, text books.  We didn't use actual books that I remember.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, they were text books that had -- they were thick.  They were probably six or seven hundred pages.
R:  So they were, like, readers like of?
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  Mm.  I guess we had -- I mean, we had -- I -- I'm trying to remember.  It's been so long.  [LAUGH]. But it seems like in -- in ninth grade we had a reader, but then starting in tenth grade, it -- we just read books after that.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  And we read --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- I guess, tenth grade was American literature and eleventh grade was English literature and then in my senior year, it was an AP class and I can't remember what we did.  I guess we read a book and then wrote an essay about it.  That was all.
L:  All the way through I remember readers.
R:  Huh.  What was in --
L:  I mean, I did a lot of reading on my own, but there -- it was just one of my favorite things to do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So actually, I read Of Mice and Men.  I just happened to take it out at the library.  It wasn't something that was assigned for me to read. 
R:  And that is a beautiful book, I have to say I really liked that one.
L:  I loved that book.  Even to this day, and gosh, it's been probably ten years since I first read it and I've read it once or twice since then.  
R:  Mm.
L:  I have kids now, I don't have time to read much any more.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I also have a son and so I have no time to read now.
L:  [NOISE].  I mean, I read a lot of books to them, but there's not much --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  -- that -- time for reading real books.
R:  Board books aren't the same, right?  [LAUGH].  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know, I guess the -- the -- so what was in the readers that you were reading from?  'Cause um -- that's certainly a way for a school to avoid any kind of controversy, is to just sort of subscribe to a text book and then, you know, then it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- not -- then it's sort of removed the entire issue.
L:  I remember one year, I think it was, um, I don't even remember my senior year for some reason.  I mean, I remember some of it, but like, far as literature and stuff, there must not of been a whole lot of it, because I don't -- nothing stands out in my mind.  But I remember, like, tenth and eleventh, somewhere in there, it was Shakespeare, um --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- pretty much throughout the year.  Shakespeare. Um, then a lot of their -- um, the plays and the class would all get different roles and do the play and different things like that, but --
R:  Can I ask, did you go to public school or private school?
L:  Public school.
R:  Public school.  So did I, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I'm planning on home schooling my kids.
R:  Really?
L:  I'm starting in September.  
R:  And are --
L:  I'm really excited.  [LAUGH].
R:  How -- how old are you -- how old are they?
L:  My oldest is five --
R:  Five.
L:  -- and he would be starting public school kindergarten in the fall, 'cause of the cut off date.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  And my youngest one is two.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That's all I have, is two boys, a five year old and a two year old.
R:  Oh, that's nice.  Yeah, I have a seven year old boy and he's -- he did public school kindergarten in our area and it was kind of a -- we were really heartbroken.  It was kind of a -- a waste of time because they just -- it was not academic at all.  Huh.
L:  Mhm?
R:  He didn't -- it was kind of a wasted year.  He did more in preschool the year before than he did in the kindergarten.
R:  That's when I found out that I really wanted to home school, when I tried to send my, um, oldest to preschool, because he was, like two and a half and I put him in a three year old class.  They just happened to let him in because they had some openings and they needed the funding.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But he knew [NOISE] everything that they were already teaching in that class.  
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  [NOISE].  It's okay.  [NOISE].  There you go.  Here.  
R:  Oh.
L:  By the time he was two, and my two year old now, he knows all this stuff, too.  I just taught it to him as a game, like their ABC's and counting to ten --
R:  Yeah, that's the --
L:  -- their shapes and colors.
R:  I know.  I was really surprised that -- that the -- all of the daycare and the preschool classes that my son went to, they hadn't learned -- they hadn't learned letters and counting and -- and shapes and colors and all of that.  I was really shocked at that, actually.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, I was, too.
R:  And then --
L:  I was, like, really shocked because I sent him to preschool hoping that -- well, I was, like, well, this is all I can really think of to teach him at the time, you know, 'cause he was two and a half.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I thought, well, maybe they know some stuff that I haven't taught him yet.  This'd be good for him, you know?  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  
L:  And I was, like, this is such a waste, 'cause he started picking up bad habits from the other kids.
R:  Yeah, he -- they do.
L:  And that's really all he was bringing home, was these bad habits and I would ask him, "Well, what did you learn today?"  "Letter E".  "But that was yesterday, too", and -- 
R:  Oh, no, that was good.  Last year, our kindergart- this -- this is a kindergarten class, they did one letter per -- per week.
L:  Yeah, that drove me crazy.  I was, like --
R:  I couldn't believe it.
L:  And he already could identify most of 'em, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  He was just two and a half, but he was still working on it, but they would concentrate on one a week, and I was, like, okay.  [LAUGH].
R:  Well, that's pretty good.  I mean, imagine if that were kindergarten and they were doing one a week?  [LAUGH].  That was sad.  But, so --
L:  Oh, and that was kindergarten?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  That was kindergarten and -- and he went in knowing his -- the beginnings and ending sounds of words and he was starting to read and all of that and --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- he just made no progress in that entire year.
L:  That's why I don't want to send mine to public school because he started reading about six months ago --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I'd say he's on, like, a late kindergarten, early first grade level.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And he's ahead of most kids his age, I think, as far as public school guidelines. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  [LAUGH].  I mean --
R:  'Cause they don't --
L:  -- what they expect them to know.  He would be so bored.  
R:  Yeah, they do.  The thing is that at -- well, it sort of depends on their teacher.  You're sort of at the mercy of whether they get a good teacher or not --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they're -- they have not very high expectations, I think.  
L:  No.  They don't.
R:  I think they can't because they have to teach to sort of the average kid, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- yeah, that's frustrating.  And would you --
L:  And there are a lot of kids, I guess, that maybe their parents don't spend the time teaching them that stuff.
R:  I guess --
L:  That they figure they'll learn it when they get to school --
R:  Which is astounding, but --
L:  -- you know, but the ones that have had time spent with them and they know all this stuff, they're going, okay, this is boring.
R:  Yeah, and --
L:  Already know this.  Teach me something I don't know.
R:  Have you considered a private school or --
L:  I thought about it, but I'm just really -- I'd rather home school 'em because that way I can keep him on his own level and he can go at his own pace.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  You know, and I mean, he's even doing really good in math, too.  He's adding and subtracting.
R:  Well, that's very good.
L:  You know, and he's doing really good, so public or private, I don't think they would be able to keep up with him.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  And I would hate to do something to make him feel like learning is boring --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because since he was a little baby, it's been --
