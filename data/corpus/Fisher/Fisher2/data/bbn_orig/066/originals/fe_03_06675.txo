R:  Cheryl.
L:  Carol. [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, you're Carol?
L:  [NOISE] No, I'm Delores.
R:  You're Delores. [LAUGH] I'm Cheryl.
L:  Cheryl?
R:  Yes.
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  Good, how are you?
L:  Great.
R:  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  Is this your first conversation?
R:  [SIGH] No, actually it's my third.
L:  Really? Good for you.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  This is --
R:  How about you?
L:  This is my first.
R:  Oh, it is?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay. [LIPSMACK]  
L:  Yeah, they just emailed me yesterday [SIGH] and they told me -- in fact it was just this morning I believe, [SIGH] and, uh, I just got the first phone call.
R:  Oh, right.
L:  Yeah, so this --
R:  Well, it goes quick. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, that's what I heard. [LAUGH] 
R:  So, [SIGH] um, well, do you exercise regularly?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yes, I do.  I do a lot of walking, um --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- try to do, uh, an hour a day.
R:  Every day, huh?
L:  [MN] Well, I try to.  Now our weather has been really nasty with rain [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and --
R:  Where are you from?
L:  [SIGH] Virginia Beach, Virginia?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, okay.  I'm from, um, Kansas City.
L:  Oh, okay.  How's it over there?
R:  [SIGH] It's hot today.
L:  Oh.
R:  Very hot. [SIGH] 
L:  Well, usually it's hot here but we've been getting this nasty rain and, uh, [SIGH] on and off in between the days, so it's really hard to get out, do what you really want to do, to be on a regular schedule. [SIGH] 
R:  [SIGH] But you normally walk an hour every day, huh?
L:  Yes, I do.
R:  Oh, and you have a certain path that you go on every day?
L:  Yes, I do, I got a certain, uh, places the way I r- g- go and it's basically four miles.
R:  Oh, my goodness, good for you.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Good for you.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  [SIGH] I do step aerobics three times a week.
L:  Oh, okay, that's good.
R:  So, yes, I d -- it makes me feel better.
L:  Really?
R:  Uh, it's -- yeah -- every night, 'cause I have small children [SIGH] --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- and, um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I don't know, it just gives me more energy when I come home from work all day, after I've exercised --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and [SIGH] -- and it makes it -- I think it's just good all the way around, mentally, physically and everything else, so 
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, yeah, it is good.  Uh, yeah, I'm older, I've -- I'm -- I'll be fif- I'm going to be sixty [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] and I've got grandchildren and stuff [SIGH] but as you get older, you know, you do put on the weight and you don't even eat as much.
R:  [SIGH] I know.  Well, I know that. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Well, you got little ones, so you're not that old. [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh, it's -- it -- it's just great to get out to -- and, you know, to s- just mingle and just see what's going on out there, you know, and think --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- your own thoughts, [SIGH] and --
R:  Do you walk with somebody or by yourself.
L:  No, I usually go by myself.
R:  You do?  Okay.
L:  But I -- I like to -- you know, I'm k- kind of fast walking, my husband just had a hip replacement so he really can't walk.  He walks on his own and I can't keep -- he can't keep up with me.
R:  [SIGH] See, my husband walks, like, four miles every day, also --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and then on the weekends he goes for seven miles [SIGH] and he doesn't want anybody else to go with him, the kids or I or anybody, it's his, like, own time to --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [SIGH] to, um, exercise and I don't know, it's his own kind of mental time too I think. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Well, it i- it is good to be -- well, it's nice to have somebody, but sometimes it is nice to be on your own because you have a different pace that you can do 'cause --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you have another person you [MN] can't really keep that pace.  I'm -- they say you should be able to talk while you're walking [SIGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to do that but I -- I've been doing this, god, for years already and [SIGH] it --
R:  That's what I was going to ask you how long you've been doing it?
L:  Oh, I've been doing this for a long time, years.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, your health is probably excellent.
L:  Yeah, I h- uh, I have no physical problems. [LAUGH] I mean, I need to lose some weight, but, um --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- [SIGH] physically I'm fine, I have -- I don't take [inaudible] medication, I don't go to doctors or anything so I'm in very good health.
R:  Very good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know, I think it helps me too, um --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] my husband especially, his cholesterol was, like, oh, my gosh, a hundred and thirty or something like that, I mean, just unbelievably low, [LAUGH] I thought. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, that is low.
R:  [SIGH] So, and I know it's from all that walking he does.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, it depends on what you eat too, and I --
R:  Yeah, and he's healthy eater.  I'm not probably as good about my eating as I am about exercising. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, well --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- we just have a salad and stuff, but after the salad I have an eclair. [LAUGH] 
R:  I know, and I always tell -- I want a sweet after every meal, which is horrible. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Well, my husband's the same, he's like a cookie monster, you know, [SIGH] --
R:  Really?
L:  -- he loves his cookies and if there's nothing here we just [inaudible] 'cause we're -- my husband's ex military, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] and [MN] he's got to have his cookies. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] So, we put a -- make a cookies there and it's like, you know, he started eating two and before I -- we got to put them away. [LAUGH] 
R:  I know.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] I think I've corrupted my kids too. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] Well, I did that when the kids were younger and now they come by and then they sit and then, "Ma, I don't want that stuff, I don't need it, you know, we're on our own, we want to, you know, watch what we're doing".  But, because --
R:  Wow, well, good for them. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, they -- they know how I am, because they know what -- what cupboards to go in -- drawer, refrigerator. [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh, exactly.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes, how funny.
L:  So, in that respect, but I -- I've always -- I love to bake, I love to help make sweets and stuff like that, but, uh --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] right now we're, uh, [LIPSMACK] remodeling our kitchen and stuff so I'm basically sticking close to the house. [SIGH] 
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah, and --
R:  That's a -- you're doing it yourselves, or you're hiring [inaudible]?
L:  No, we did it ourselves years ago, like, tw- over twenty years ago, but my husband now, he's k- he'll be sixty five so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- he just doesn't have the time and he's -- his shoulders -- everything is bothering him physically [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, mentally he's fine, but physically he's basically falling apart. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  All our things start to wear down as we get older --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- it seems like. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, well, he's -- his shoulders are bothering him and this and that.  I don't have any of that problem, like, I would, you know [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-huh, that's good.
L:  -- but everybody -- yeah, it is really good.  Are you -- do you belong to, uh -- are you in R.M.C.
R:  Yes.
L:  Are you?
R:  Yes, I am.
L:  Oh, so you're fr- oh, so, do you read the chat line every day?
R:  Yes, as much -- well, you know, I have kids, again, and I work so it's [MN] -- as often as I can catch it, so 
L:  Oh, okay, yeah, I have --
R:  I love it, though.
L:  Oh, yeah, I've been with, uh, what's the -- oh, what's her name?  Michelle for -- uh, since eighty.
R:  Oh, you're kidding?
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah. [SIGH] Yeah, I've been doing refunding all that time since eighty.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  But, uh, right --
R:  That is great, have -- do you make post on there sometimes?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you -- [SIGH] oh, see, I've never posted on there, I just --
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  -- read it.
L:  -- I h- I -- yeah, I have a couple on there right now.  Well, what it is it's the, uh [SIGH] Pfizer[?] and the movie tickets.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Uh-huh. Yeah, like --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I've had over a hundred and twenty five, I think I sold over a hundred of 'em. [SIGH] 
R:  Oh, you're kidding?
L:  Yeah, I did pretty good, I think [SIGH] -- and I get a lot of the stamps and the money and stuff but [SIGH] in fact I was just going to check I -- I'm so slow behind on it because, um, the past couple of weekends I've been having yard sales [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and trying to get rid of all my supply and stuff, you know. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Well, so, you -- you, um, got the Pfizer movie tickets and then sold them?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Wow, in your garage sale, or how did you sell 'em?
L:  [SIGH] No, I sold them on the -- uh, you know, with the girls, I put the post on, you know, and I've been --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- selling them for a dollar each plus, you know, you pay the postage and stuff.
R:  Wow, you're --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- selling them for a dollar each?
L:  Yeah, because they're w- you can get four tickets on there, on each -- on each form.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  Mhm, and you only need one proof for each one.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, it is -- it's a good one, I've, you know, had a lot of girls who buy in ten of them and some buy seven, some buy two, three, whatever, you know. [SIGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  In fact I was just going to go check, I just got some mail and I'll respond so I was going to go back on to ch- [SIGH] um, uh, my email and, you know, tell them that I got their f- you know, the money and [LIPSMACK] and they'll come back and tell me if they got the forms and stuff, you know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  'Cause I always try to keep [MN] back -- I keep record of everything [SIGH] and I --
R:  I need a l- [SIGH] so, you do the off -- the off [MN] topic chit chat?
L:  No, I'm not on the off, no.
R:  Oh, just on the regular chit chat?
L:  Yeah, regular chit chat --
R:  [MN] Okay.
L:  -- but I -- you know, I do post, you know --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and then, uh --
R:  All right.
L:  -- 'cause everybody would email if they want the forms or whatever and I've been --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- busy 'cause I'm just --
R:  Yeah, oh, my gosh.
L:  Yeah, I've been doing pretty but [SIGH] refunding I do a little because there's [SIGH] not too much in this area to find forms and stuff.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, I don't know if you do a lot of refunding, do you?
R:  [SIGH] Little bit, little --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, I did the Hershey, um, [LIPSMACK] um --
L:  The certificate?
R:  Yeah, I just got those in the mail today.
L:  Yeah, I just got mine the oth- yesterday.
R:  [LIPSMACK] So, and then with the dollar coupon, that was nice too.
L:  Yeah, that was nice, yeah.  in fact I did -- well, my son -- I let him [MN] do it on his name too, and he lives out of here -- [LIPSMACK] so he came by with it and [SIGH] he came by and he brought the tickets and he said, "Oh, can I  --" you know, the certificates and he said, "Can I have it?"  I said, "Here, sure, you can have two". [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Isn't that nice?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Did you do all movie tickets or did you do the Springers[?]
L:  No, I did the -- uh, for the music.
R:  Oh, you did the music?
L:  The music certificates.
R:  Okay, okay.
L:  Yeah, and I didn't even read them yet 'cause I just got 'em yesterday and I -- I don't even know what's involved or anything and somebody was saying that you couldn't use them at Circuit City. [SIGH] 
R:  Oh, I don't know, I didn't do music, I did sporting goods and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and the movie theater.
L:  Oh, okay.  I -- I just didn't do the movies 'cause of the movies -- [SIGH] we go to the movies and we always go early show so they're not --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- worth ten dollars.
R:  They're not that cheap, right.
L:  Yeah, and I -- we get 'em for less than six dollars, so I said, "The heck, I would rather use to get my ten dollars worth". 
R:  [SIGH] Right, right.
L:  And sports, I really don't get into sports.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, well, we do for the -- I have two boys, so --
L:  Oh, how old are they?
R:  -- we -- and they're both in sport, so --
L:  How -- how old are your sons?
R:  [LIPSMACK] they are seven and five.
L:  Oh, you got little ones.
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  God, I can remember those [SIGH] days. [LAUGH] 
R:  I know. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  Well, that's great, really.
R:  That's so -- yeah. [SIGH] Um, [LIPSMACK] I missed out on that Pfizer deal, I wished I would have gotten in on that, but I took --
L:  Yeah, I still got some forms.
R:  Huh. [SIGH] So, the f- you would send -- like, if I sent you a dollar, you would send a form and then I would have to buy a product and --
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, basically, on this form is --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you can do four tickets and you need one proof from each [SIGH] -- for each of them to do f -- get the four -- four movie tickets, and they're --
R:  Yeah, so, buy four --
L:  -- really simple s-
R:  -- items?
L:  Yeah, mhm.
R:  Okay. [SIGH] so, what's, like, a good thing to buy?
L:  [SIGH] Uh, well, I mean, they have Listerine on it, they have Zantac, [SIGH] they have the mouthwash, you know, you --
R:  So, things that are --
L:  -- you get --
R:  -- pretty cheap?
L:  Yeah, you can get pre- uh, I mean, one of the girls has come back and tell me, well, the -- she did the Zantac, this time I think it was on the thirtieth or something [SIGH] and she was saying that, uh, this ti- last time she did it 'cause she bought em at Wall mart and she only used -- she used a dollar coupon, she only paid, like, twenty or thirty cents --
R:  Oh, my gosh, okay.
L:  -- but this -- this particular time, they wanted the thirty gal, last time I guess there wasn't a particular size, you --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- but --
R:  So, they caught on to that? [LAUGH] 
L:  Probably, but they have roll waves, they have Lysine[?], Benadryl, Sudafed --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- whole bunch of stuff, you know and if you've [SIGH] -- you know, you buy the stuff and you use a coupon and stuff so you're getting, uh, maybe th- three dollars or two dollars or whatever [SIGH] so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- basically, you know, you're buying your product that you need and then you're going to get a free movie ticket.
R:  Wow, I'm going to have to check your post.  Is it out there now?
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] Oh, I had one a couple of days back, so it's probably --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- old now.
R:  Okay. [SIGH] I can look back and see, then.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah. [LIPSMACK] Yeah, it's, uh -- my name is Delores Corbin.
R:  Okay, okay.
L:  Okay, [SIGH] and you can check -- in fact I guess that I'm going to check my emails again here today because I -- [SIGH] I've gotten a couple --
