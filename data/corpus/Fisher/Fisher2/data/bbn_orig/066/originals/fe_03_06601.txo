R:  Hello? 
L:  Hello. 
R:  Hi I'm Angela. 
L:  I'm Beverly.
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  Nice to meet you too.
R:  So we're talking about, um, censorship?
L:  Whether schools be censoring books, well I had an experience with that.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I taught at a private school, and it was a real uncomfortable situation.  These were eight graders who had chosen a book you know one of their classmates had read it and she really liked it.  I looked it over I felt it was suitable, and the principal got very upset.  It had a little bit more sex and drugs in it than the principal thought was just not acceptable, but these are urban children age thirteen to fifteen and they probably knew more than what was in those books.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So it became a pretty big issue and ended up telling the children they couldn't do any reports on it.  It didn't stop them from reading the book.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If any thing they just went underground with it.
R:  Yeah that's true.  Was it a Christian school? 
L:  Yes. 
R:  Yes they tend to be a little harder on that.  Well I don't know my kids are still young my -- my oldest is only in second grade.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  So, um, he's still reading just the you know barely chapter books. 
L:  Oh, I know that stage -- yeah.
R:  But you know what he reads Harry Potter.
L:  Now that's one of the books that's come up you know there's always been this question in Christian schools whether or not Harry Potter was suitable.
R:  Yes I'm a member of a lot of mother's groups and I'm around stay at home mum's a lot because that's what I am and, um, you'd be surprised how many just flat out had never seen it or even read it and they're just like no get it away from my child.
L:  Exactly they haven't taken the time to the find out just what's in the books but someone told them this is the problem --
R:  Exactly -- exactly but I've read all four of them and I'm dying for the fifth one to come out.
L:  Yes.
R:  It is wonderful.  And I think as long as you [inaudible] it in a way that they know this is pretend --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know that, um, you know and talk to them about it and that's just kind of what we do but I think -- I think Christian schools can have a lit more [inaudible] than --
L:  You know when teach your children with the whole thought of okay you're going to find things that don't match to what you know of.
R:  Right.
L:  But learn about them and then remember that you don't have to do everything that you read.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And I mean that's one of the thinks when I had to go through it with my principal and I had to keep reminding her that these children are not as innocent as we were at that age.
R:  Right.
L:  You know these children are out there doing things that we really wish we didn't have to know about.
R:  Exactly. 
L:  You know and they feed to know they can come somewhere and talk about this stuff.
R:  That is exactly right.
L:  Parents are working you know two ore three jobs they don't have time.
R:  Exactly and you know if they're doing a report on it that would be a time for them to put their own input about it and you know teachers can see exactly where they're coming from because right now you come and know they know a lot but you don't know just how much.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And that could open a that door you know to some conversations.  Now I don't agree with pornography.
L:  Right.
R:  Or anything of that nature but you know as long as -- you know some of these like they're banning things like [inaudible]
L:  Mhm.  
R:  I just -- I don't -- I don't know.
L:  That's ridiculous to me.
R:  It's history and maybe we don't agree with what happened in the past but it did happen and if we read about it we can learn how to avoid it in the future.
L:  Exactly now where else can you discuss these things? 
R:  Exactly.
L:  Literature is such a good way to open children's minds and I'd rather have a book in front of a child and get a child to talk about it than have them tell me something they saw on one of these talk shows.
R:  Yes -- Oh, yes.
L:  And unfortunately these talk shows are becoming the touchstone for these children.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know they're constantly talking about, "Oh, I saw this, and I was that" and, "Is it okay for us to do these things?".
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know I mean I'd much rather take it out of a book so we can sit down and really analyze it.  These talk shows are ridiculous.
R:  I don't know it's -- it's easier to keep things away from kids when they're younger like mine.
L:  That's true but then at some point you know you'll get to the age where maybe the friends are looking at something.
R:  Yeah friends are already quoting from movies and I'm like, "Hey" [LAUGH] you know.
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  And I hear about these they all want to be Bruce Almighty and I'm like, "I don't know".
L:  Oh, my goodness.  Mhm -- well the first year that South Park started --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- I had an -- oh, my goodness the mother did not watch the whole episode she must of just seen the beginning with the characters.
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  And she's talking about, "Oh, what a lovely little cartoon this is for the children would but it's on so late"
R:  Oh, nope.
L:  I -- I was so under the desk laughing. I asked her did she actually watch the whole thing and she said, "Oh, no I was getting ready for bed" and I'm thinking and your eight year old is sitting there with his eye balls glued open.
R:  Oh, my goodness.  
L:  Watching this and coming to school the next day quoting it no lady watch the show.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my goodness that's terrible.
L:  Oh, but she thought because she saw animation --
R:  Yep. 
L:  -- you know Oh, this is wonderful sweetie this is not you know Mickey Mouse.
R:  Yeah really.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, but these are the same parents that would raise all kinds of noise if you have them reading a book they might have the word damn in it.
R:  That is incredible -- that is incredible.  I hear so many crazy things with the schools you know now that my kids are school age and it's just -- I don't know but you know I think for one thing I think if you allow it in the school library they should be able to read it.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And what they need to do is just get organized about what they're going to have in the library and just say pick something out of there.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  You know.
L:  We always had a way of finding books that you know there was no way you would find in the school library.
R:  Mhm.
L:  My mother had her stash under the bed and when she wasn't home I'd fish them out and I knew how to put them back exactly the way she did it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I've seen my students do the same thing.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  I had a fourth grader who came to school with his father's copies of Playboy.
R:  Oh. 
L:  And I'm -- I was ready to hit the roof.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  You know he had a folder full of them --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and he said, "Oh, well daddy said these are good for young boys"
R:  Oh, my gosh. 
L:  And I'm saying young boy at what age sixteen.
R:  Yes sixteen.
L:  You know but the boy was like, "Well daddy it said was okay" and I said, "Let me speak to your father" you know -- said, "No no no".  Daddy did not know those books left the house and he was very embarrassed.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  No of course we laughed about it for months afterwards but you see you hide stuff and the kids find it.
R:  Yep do as I say not as I do.
L:  Oh, of course.
R:  But you know --
L:  I mean that line didn't even work when I grew up.
R:  Oh, yeah me neither but, um, you know I do child care sometimes and there were some four year old kids that are getting together and they're hugging on each other and kissing each other and we just had a separate them but they're -- I'm just like, "What is going on?". 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then the little boy started after my little five year old and I grabbed her up quick.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  On my lap.
L:  I know they're picking these things up earlier and earlier.
R:  They sure are and you know but for them -- they you know back to the books they really need to have a place to discuss things.
L:  They do.
R:  And I think school you know is the appropriate place cause like you said a lot of parents aren't always home to do that.
L:  But it's always been a concern about what -- you know what kind of morals --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- would they come across in school and I think that's part of trusting that the teacher is going to know how to handle this.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  I mean I don't see any teacher that I've ever known coming in there with an attitude, "Oh, well the kids can read anything they want" and let me -- let them know that everything is fine.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  All of us have always had this thing about concern the children can put these things into perspective.
R:  Right well and you know it's so sad though to me how sometimes well meaning parents get in there and start stirring things up --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- because and it's the same parents who worry about what books you know don't let them read [inaudible] , and they're it same ones that say you know can't have any thing about Christianity in the school.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And I'm like you want them to have Christian morals but they can't say Christian.
L:  That's right.
R:  So I don't know.
L:  And the children learn very quickly that these parents all just playing the game.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then they just go off on the side and do whatever they want to do and just make sure that nobody knows at all.
R:  Well that's true.
L:  And invariably it will come out at some point some child's going to make a statement in the wrong place and then the whole thing comes out, "Oh, yeah my mother won't let me do this but"
R:  Yep but they're doing it anyway.
L:  Oh, yeah -- you know you just hope that they're not doing anything illegal.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Now things can get so scary with children.
R:  Oh, that's right.  [LAUGH]
L:  I know my son is twenty seven and I just held my breath through his teenage years.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  You know whatever -- I don't want him into any craziness I just had a talk to him as much as possible.
R:  Yep -- yeah they say talking is the anti-drug.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah and the way it is true because if you talk about things with your children most likely they won't feel, "Oh, well yeah I'm doing this and nobody knows, nobody cares".
R:  Yeah. 
L:  But then you've also got children that will sit there, smile in your face and tell you want your want hear.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And the second you're not
