R:  Hello?
L:  Hello, hi.
R:  I didn't hear the whole topic, did you?
L:  Yes, it was, ah,  censorship, and, ah, whether or not public or private schools should have the right to ban students from reading certain books.
R:  Oh, okay, I -- I had some problem on the line or something.  My name is Ann, and I'm in Memphis, Tennessee.
L:  Hi, Ann, my name is Laurie, and I'm in, ah, New York City.
R:  Okay.  Um, I probably don't -- maybe should have waited on another topic, 'cause I don't have any school children right now, but I guess I can form an opinion, --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- why don't you tell me what you think, and then I'll try to [LAUGH] get a thread from there?
L:  Sure.  Okay, well, I, ah,  I think I'm opposed to censorship as a general principle, um, I think that, ah,  it's a librarian's, I guess, right and responsibility to choose the books that are in a school library, ah,  I don't think it is the right or the responsibility of the school to tell children that they can't read certain books, you know, however, ah, they're procuring them, I think the school has c- control over the content of the library, and that's about, I think, as far as their reach should go, so if there're books that -- if there are books that the school feels, as a -- whoever's making those decisions, that they feel that they're not appropriate for the school children, then they [MN] probably wouldn't have them in their libraries.  
R:  You know, are they [MN] do you think, talking about elementary school or junior high or high school, I didn't understand that either.
L:  Uh, that's a good question, I don't know, I didn't, ah, --
R:  Personally, I believe it might make somewhat of a difference, I don't have a strong opinion on this issue one way or the other, but generally, I think you have to trust in the people that make the choices for the reading material, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I think that they should be called to account, in other words, I suppose there would be such a situation where one person was bringing so many, ah, objectionable material books into the school, that sooner or later, I guess, someone should step in, --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- but I would think they have, like, cross checks, it's not usually up to just one person, is it, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- since I don't have any school children right now, I don't really know how that's done exactly.
L:  Right, right.  Um, yeah, I'm not -- I'm not sure, right -- I -- I guess it would probably depend, like, on community standards, you know, I mean, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- some, I think, school districts are run differently, and it's, I mean, it's such an open question, but I would say, yeah, in general, --
R:  Yeah, it's a -- quite a- a- a- an extensive question, because there's so many ifs and ands --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- that I would need to ask before I would have to say whether I was for or against censorship.
L:  Sure.
R:  I think that there would -- in my view, there would be a point beyond which, say, in grammar school, or junior high school, that you would not want to expose that age child --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- to certain types of literature, um, I believe, in high school, it might be a little bit different, I think they're going to be exposed to it one way or the other in high school, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but, to a certain extent, I think we want to shield [LAUGH] elementary school.  But I don't -- I don't believe they're -- the type of censorship they're talking about is -- is obscene words, or something like that, that's what's kind of confusing to me, what, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- what type of censorship is in place now, and I don't know if it's educational censorship, or content censorship, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so it's hard for me to give a hard, fast answer, but, generally, I think you have to be pretty broad and you have to trust the people that have been entrusted --
L:  Right.
R:  -- with this decision, as to what literature to bring into the school system.
L:  Absolutely.  Now I wonder, though, um, if, if it's -- sometimes books are censored by -- you know, I mean, they're based on -- I guess censorship is based on a community standard of -- I mean, there are probably many communities in the United States that would, ah,  think about censoring books based on their religious content, --
R:  Correct, correct.
L:  -- you know, if, ah, if there was a whatever, you know, an anti Christian view, or something, -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- that was somehow, ah, you know, threatening or derogatory to, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in that case, I mean, that's -- I guess that's where it becomes a slippery slope, not --
R:  Yeah, I think --
L:  -- just for --
R:  -- you've hit on the -- the correct thing, I think it's becoming a little clearer to me, maybe, what type of -- of material they might -- someone might be try to censor, I was a little confused at first --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but I think you -- you've hit it right on the head, I think it would have to do with, ah, maybe, something that would be offensive to a particular religion, or race, or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- its, um, economic group, or whatever, --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- but gee, wouldn't that -- wouldn't you hate to have that job! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I mean, it's, right, it's sort of setting a standard of decency in a community, which is a very -- such a subjective thing, so it would, [LAUGH] would be very difficult, I [MN], I don't know, I mean -- I -- I -- it always, it seems like everything should be decided on a case by case basis, --
R:  Right, it's --
L:  -- but when there's huge conflicts that can't be solved and it goes into the courts, that's when it really -- people have to start thinking about, you know, what --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- do we really believe as a community or as a nation, or, you know --
R:  Well, unfortunately, this is a topic that I'm fairly ignorant on, because I really truthfully did not know it was a big issue, -- 
L:  Sure.  Sure.
R:  -- ah, but maybe it is, and not having any, ah, schoolchildren, ah, I'm kind of out of that whole loop there, -- 
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- but, ah, --
L:  Well, when you, you were in school, did you -- did you remember any censorship issues, uh, --
R:  Well, that's been so long ago, --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- because I'm sixty six years old, --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- so, school was so vastly different --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- from what it is now, [LAUGH] and, and one major difference is, um, I didn't grow up, particularly in elementary school, with television --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, -- or computers, or any of the other gadgets that -- that, um, all children have now, --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- so, they're, television -- let me put it this way, television bothers me a whole lot more than the books that they might read.
L:  Oh, sure, sure, absolutely.
R:  Ah, I just am aghast at the some of those family situation, uh, comedies on television, but I guess we're supposed to stick to the book topic, --
L:  [LAUGH] right.
R:  -- ah, I just wish I knew a little -- had some profound statement to make, but, --
L:  Sure, well, it's, like, --
R:  -- I guess summing up, just off the top of my head, I would not be for any type of extensive censorship that parents would get involved with, particularly if it's literature that's classical --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I don't know why parents would make many objections, unless it was out and out obscene, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- which, maybe, in high school, there might be some, some required reading that -- that might border on obscene, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but I -- at that age, I don't -- I don't think exposure to it is going to be as detrimental as it would be earlier, --
L:  Absolutely, --
R:  -- if that makes any sense.
L:  -- I agree.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Absolutely, I can -- I graduated from high school eleven years ago, and I remember that we read some books in a class that were, you know, definitely obscene, I mean, there wasn't even really a --
R:  Oh, really, in high school?
L:  -- yes, in, ah, it was, ah, my senior year of high school, and it was, ah, an English class, and, you know, I think, -- I think to have read those books and to have, sort of, had the guidance of a teacher to talk about -- we talked about the literary themes of the books, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and there was certainly some snickering, and some embarrassment, but, you know, ultimately, we were able to sort of rise above the -- the base, ah, you know, nature of some of the material and -- and just talk more about the literature, whereas if any of us had read one of that --what that book, you know, on our own, we might have, just, gone for the more base thrill content --
R:  Right.
L:  -- rather than [LAUGH] -- you know, really examining the book as a piece of literature, so it's --
R:  Yeah, you're -- you're much, [COUGH] much more of an expert than I am, since you've encountered these situations and, uh, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that's why I'm, I'm kind of learning listening to you talk --
L:  Sure, oh, [LAUGH] -- that's good --
R:  -- because I grew up in, like, a puritan type --
L:  Right, okay --
R:  -- atmosphere, in school, where, I mean, even a-a cuss word was enough [LAUGH] --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- [LAUGH] to keep any kind of literature from us!  I was, --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- I was shielded from all that, but, ah, well that's, that's interesting, I guess it must be a -- a pretty big issue, if they want us to talk about it, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I guess, um, I don't know if it's the parents that are objecting, or religious leaders, I'm just not sure who is -- who is voicing these objections, --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- that's why it's hard for me --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- to -- to say, but from hearing you talk, ah, sometimes it does go a little bit too far -- maybe, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- do you suppose maybe they're just not chosen carefully?
L:  Well, I -- I think, in the instance, in -- in my own ex- example, uh, I think the teacher knew exactly what he was doing, and it was, --
R:  Oh, okay --
L:  -- in some, I think, in some ways I think it became political for him, you know, he was, --
R:  His agenda.
L:  -- he was known as a very brilliant teacher, but also, you know, sort of a troublemaker, or, you know, that's how he sort of liked to paint himself.
R:  Oh, --
L:  I mean, it was a small town and people get bored, and you know [LAUGH], you have to sort of stir up a little bit of trouble, so, I mean, yeah, he certainly had, you know, had read the books, had previewed -- some of the books had, um, been made into movies, he'd seen the movies, and, so I don't think there was any naivete, I think it was --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- maybe trying t- to provoke things a bit, within, you know, among the faculty, and also, --
R:  Oh, okay --
L:  -- probably, you know, too, ah, he definitely won the popularity contest among the students -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, for -- for letting us, you know, see these things that, that we, you know, that was very --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- kind of, ama- -- you know, it was great for a young kid to -- to be wa-
