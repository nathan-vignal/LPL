L:  Hi, I'm Sharon.  Hello! Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  I'm Sharon.
R:  Hi, Sharon, how are you?  My name is Lori.
L:  I'm okay.  How are you?
R:  Okay. My name is Lori.
L:  Lori?
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay.  Where are you?
R:  In Philadelphia.
L:  Oh, right.  So, I gather we're going to talk about censorship.
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay.  What do you do for a living?
R:  Um, I actually work for insurance company.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I work for insurance company.
L:  Great.  My dad was with Nationwide for forty something years.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, so, I've been around the -- the Horn on that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Ah, so, are we just supposed to do this ourselves?
R:  I guess so, we are, --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- they say we're supposed to talk about censorship.
L:  Right, well, --
R:  So --
L:  -- what's your feeling [inaudible] about censorship?
R:  Well, basically, I feel that people should have the right to speak, about what they feel, without having to worry about what's going to, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- what they can and can't say, --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and I understand sometimes censorship is very important.
L:  Yeah, I think you have to get into the constitutionality of it, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, freedom of speech.
R:  Yes.
L:  Even though that irks us sometimes and we don't agree with people, and you know, it's -- still, we have to honor that, don't we?
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I have to honor that in my job.  
L:  Right, oh, sure.
R:  There are some things you just can't say.
L:  I was reading something this morning -- I'm a minister, --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, um, yeah, I was reading something this morning about the colors of our churches, and this -- the gal that wrote it had grown up in New Hampshire, and talked about, when she was five years old, they had to draw a picture of the church, and everybody had white crayons, which is interesting, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they ran out of time, so, she drew her own and, it was purple and pink and yellow, but she created an open door on the church, -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and, ah, she said, after all these years, her church still stands, you know, that it's colorful, but --  and, the door is still open, and you know, I think that's what we have to think about.
R:  Mhm.
L:  The thing I always say is, you know, if God had only created -- roses are beautiful, I love roses, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but if God had only created roses, you know, they would have become commonplace, and we kind of got used to them; but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, you know, I think variety's good.
R:  That's also just like I was reading a -- well, you see what's going on in the world today, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I see that a lot of, like, the media, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they are not allowed to say a lot of things that have happened, such as the guy who just lost his life on that boat --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there's a lot of things that they probably can't say --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and that's where censorship is playing a big part in it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because they can't even tell his family, you know, [MN] they don't -- they don't know anything theirselves, but they have to follow by their code, they have to --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they can't say anything until it's been fully investigated.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  So that's a form of --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  -- censorship also.
L:  But what do you think about the fact that the media, for instance, c- -- um, you know, colors everything we do, you know, I mean, --
R:  Yeah, they play a big part in --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- censorship also.  Yes, they really do.
L:  Well, like the last elections.  You know, I mean, there you go, you know, d- do we, can we do or say anything to kind of put the screws to them, because, you know, they, in a very real way, um, colored the outcome of the last election.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, so --
R:  Yes, and that -- censorship played a real big part in that.
L:  Absolutely, absolutely.  So, you know, it's -- it's a tough call, um, but I think, you know, I don't know if you agree with it, but, I think, basically, freedom of speech is the bottom line, I mean, everybody has a right to -- to say or do, what -- you know, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- see, but, is that right?  I mean, is that -- is that something that we ought to look at again?  I mean, that's constitutional again, but --
R:  Yes, and that's very hard, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because, and I know, it's hard with you, being a minister and all --
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, then --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you have to -- you have to honor everybody's opinion, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when everybody's -- you know, I talked to somebody today and they said, "Well, so and so doesn't like this particular church", and I'm, like, "Well, you know --
R:  That's their choice, --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- you know, they just have to find a church that they fit in", but everybody doesn't fit at the same church.
L:  Right, right.
R:  So they are -- that's a form of censorship, because you're trying to figure out what suits them, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they have to listen to everything, before you can decide what's going to suit you.
L:  But what about things like books in school?  Do you have children?
R:  Yes, yes.  Some -- some books I just don't want my children reading in school.
L:  Well, do you think they ought to be censored?
R:  Yes.  Yes, I do.  Some -- some books I -- I really feel that -- should not,  their place is not in the schools. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Not now.
L:  Can you think of any offhand?
R:  Um, Tom Sawyer.
L:  Really?
R:  Yes.  
L:  Oh, I guess th- the black white thing.
R:  Yes.  
L:  I hadn't even thought about that.
R:  Yes.
L:  I'm -- I'm obviously white, and I hadn't --
R:  Tom Sawyer, that's one.
L:  Really?
R:  When I was growing up at school, my mother --
L:  Really?
R:  -- wouldn't allow us to read it.  No, --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- no, we weren't allowed to read it.
L:  Well, that's an interesting point, do you think the --
R:  Huh?
L:  That's an interesting point, do you think the black white situation has been exacerbated by literature that our children read?  I mean are there --
R:  Well, I think it's more so, the -- it's the language.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I think it's the language. 
L:  Really?
R:  -- because a lot of, I've read it since I've been -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know, when I got a little bit older, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I was reading when I was in fifth grade, -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- at a --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- ninth grade reading level --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, once we began to read certain books I was not allowed to read at school, my father allowed us to read them at home, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and when we would have to do our reports, we would have to tell him basically why -- what was the racial issues -- we would have to --
L:  Oh, that's interesting.
R:  Yes, we would have to do a report for home too.
L:  Really?
R:  Yes, and it's basically on the words, the wording, a lot of the words, we would have to write the definitions, and -- since, ah, we had to distinguish.
L:  'Cause I guess the -- Jim they referred to as nigger in that book, didn't they?
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and when you look the definition up for that, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they had to change the, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because of censorship, they had to change the definition, but the definition that I always saw when I was growing up was a person who does not know how to act in public, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  So that could be -- and basically, that could be anybody, at any time --
L:  Well, exactly.  I -- I've got people of mine --
R:  -- who didn't know how to act in public -- they never say the color.
L:  Exactly.  I've always said there are white -- you know, there are a lot of white N's in the world, too, and -- and I got some of them living in my neighborhood right now --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, that don't know how to act and, that's exactly the way I've defined it, but, um, --
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, and, see, censorship plays a big part in that.  I know I was, ah, Webster has a, you know, they haven't done a new dictionary in a long time, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and recently, they've got a new dictionary out.
L:  Right.  What about, um, what was I going to say, what about something that had to do with that, ah, --
R:  Huh?
L:  -- so, books are big issues, with censorship, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- yeah, and so, you think, there are some books that ought to be --
R:  Yeah, some books, I -- I feel, a certain age, ah, maybe when they get in, like, eleventh and twelfth grade when they'll begin to understand the real meaning of what it is, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they should be allowed to read 'em then.  I don't think they should be reading them at eighth grade.
L:  What about the Bible?
R:  I believe that's for all ages.
L:  Well, do you think, do you think there's anything, --
R:  No, not, you know, no -- you know, I don't believe there could be any censorship, a lot of people would try to make it some.
L:  Uh-huh, oh, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- absolutely.
R:  Yes.
L:  But will --
R:  They've been doing that for years.  But really, with the Bible, I don't feel that there should -- there is any censorship.
L:  Well, I've alw- -- I always think that th- th- the role of women and of -- of dark skinned people has always been downplayed in the Bible, you know, they've never really understood all that.
R:  Mhm.  And that's with, but, that's with every religion.
L:  Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, exactly.
R:  That's with every religion.  You know. 
L:  Um, how about the Press and censorship, how do you think about -- what do you think about that?
R:  About what?
L:  The Press.
R:  The Press?
L:  The Press and censorship.
R:  [inaudible] They're horrible, you know, ah, --
L:  I mean, should they do --
R:  Yeah, you can use that just for when you say, a lot of -- a lot of movie stars, they have to deal with that, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they have to deal with that, because that's what's the fact, they decide to -- that they -- in fact, they decide that they want to become a public ornament, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- in other words, and the press covers all of those movie stars as public ornaments.
L:  Mhm.  Um, --
R:  You got to look up under the bottom.  Zero four zero nine, it's greased lightning there -- oh, bleach.  [NOISE] Could you hold one second?
L:  Sure.  
R:  [PAUSE] Hello?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yes, I'm here.
L:  [COUGH] do you think the Press ought to, um, --
R:  They cause a --
L:  -- be censored more for what they say?
R:  Yes, if it's not honest.
