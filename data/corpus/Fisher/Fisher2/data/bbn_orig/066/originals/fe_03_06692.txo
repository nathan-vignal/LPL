R:  My --
L:  Hello.
R:  Hey, my name's Patrick.
L:  My name is Bridget.
R:  Hey, Bridget.  How're you doing?
L:  I'm fine.
R:  Uh, well, uh, I guess the topic of the day is do you exercise regularly?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, I keep active, I don't regulars -- regularly exercise.  I monitor my diet.
L:  That -- that's about the same here. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Mm. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I um, uh -- I'm getting a bit of a belly now.  Uh, whenever I get -- whenever it starts getting, I go ahead and do pushups, uh --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- like, um, on a regular basis until --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I build up, uh, to a level where I start maintaining back to my normal weight.
L:  [MN] That's a good idea. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, and then my belly goes down.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But the problem is right now I'm suffering from an ex- -- such an extreme amount of stress, I can't even give myself massages anymore.
L:  [LAUGH] Yes, stress'll do that to ya.  Oh.
R:  So I'm looking for a good masseuse and hopefully a write off with, uh, my med insurance, that's why I'm working with my doctor.
L:  Mm.  Will the insurance pay for that?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Uh, in certain cases, yeah.
L:  Really?  Uh.
R:  Right now it -- it's like, uh, my neck is so stiff right now, uh, that, uh, to do otherwise would be, uh, endangering my health.
L:  Ours'll pay for a chiropractor --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but they won't pay for a massage.
R:  No, no, not massage.
L:  Okay.
R:  Physical therapist.
L:  Oh, physical therapy, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  All right.
R:  That's the way -- how it has to be written off.  That's what my doctor told me.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  They won't pay for a masseuse, no.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's just a little bit too, uh --
L:  I wish. [LAUGH]
R:  -- too kinky for them, too borderline.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, right, right.  Well, chiropractors, for the most part, they don't like those either but -- oh, no.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  So I'm about two hundred and ten pounds, a little bit over, I'm six foot four --
L:  [MN] So actually you're --
R:  -- I'm middle build.
L:  You're pretty good health, then.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Pretty good shape, oh.
R:  Well, like I said, I'm a little bit -- medium build so I got a bit of a belly there.
L:  Oh.  Well, if you got time and can do something but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- if you're like all the rest of us and don't have time to exercise and --
R:  [SIGH] Well --
L:  -- barely get dinner on the table, that's [LAUGH] enough of a --
R:  Oh, that's your problem?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I got two kids, so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's kinda hard to -- to do anything and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- exercise and --
R:  You know what one of my suggestions is?
L:  What's that?
R:  Um, if you don't get worked out, find an activity where you're lifting your arms and moving your legs --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and where you don't get worn out normally from doing it.
L:  But you just normally do it anyway, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  And put on some arm weights.
L:  Mm.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I could.  Oh, that in itself would probably gain muscle --
R:  That would probably cut down so many calories and then, um, instead of playing with the kids at house and just watching them when you got your free time [MN] --
L:  Do something [MN]. [LAUGH]
R:  -- walk 'em around the block a couple of times or once.
L:  Yeah, exactly. [LAUGH]
R:  Take 'em in the stroller, get 'em some air, take 'em to the nearby park if you got one.
L:  Mm, right.
R:  Take 'em down, uh, to get an ice cream or something --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and then, um, just --
L:  And me not eat the ice cream. [LAUGH]
R:  And keep yourself -- keep yourself to a fruit sugar one --
L:  There you go, uh.
R:  -- because your -- your -- your body will use the sugar while you're exercising.
L:  Mm, yeah, I suppose it would.  Oh.
R:  Yeah.  Or keep yourself to a diet drink or something --
L:  Mm.
R:  Just any kind of drink.
L:  Mm.  I keep hearing you gotta to be hyd- -- you gotta hydrate so you don't dehydrate.
R:  Yeah, water.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Anything that you -- any time you have fluids going through your body on a constant level, it is hydration, it's just not the best if it's not positive fluids.
L:  Right, right --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- which is, uh, yeah --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- you gotta keep --
R:  Another thing, cut down on all milk --
L:  That -- that's not a problem.
R:  -- and replace it with cheese.
L:  I eat cheese but I don't drink milk.  I've never had a glass of milk.
R:  Good, good.
L:  Oh, can't stand it, oh.
R:  Oh, no.  Well, I don't mind milk, it's just that I decided a long time ago that ch- -- I love cheese and I haven't, you know -- milk's oh, so what.
L:  Yeah, so --
R:  And I drink a lot of soda so I definitely need that cheese to replace the calcium lost from the soda.
L:  I eat a lot of, uh, cottage cheese but I hear --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's okay, too, so ...
R:  Um, try hard and, uh, aged cheddar, I mean cheeses, aged cheeses and hard cheeses.
L:  Ah, okay.
R:  Yeah, you'll absorb more calcium and less, uh, cholesterol.  Also keep your flavors up, your spices.
L:  Oh, I do that, oh. [MN]
R:  Yeah, um, spices will make any meal taste decent --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, exactly.
R:  -- once you get to learn how to use them and it doesn't care what the -- what the -- what the flavorlessness of these diet meals or whatever or these speciality meals.  Spices are to keep, trust me.
L:  Yeah, make 'em a little bit more, uh, palatable. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh.
R:  And if you're worried about, you know, you gotta spend time cooking in the ki- --kitchen for the kids, try this.  Take a flour -- I -- I pick up these tortillas downtown LA.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Uh, they're not -- they're not made with lard, they're just baked like under a -- over a fire, like the old style.
L:  Just the regular flat flour tortilla?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  Take some lunch meat --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- coupla slices cheese, roll it up, pop it in the microwave or you could take like other kinds of br- -- uh, uh, flat breads --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and pop that in the microwave, grab 'em a dip and they'll love you for it.  There's their lunch.
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's a good idea.
R:  And you pop it in the microwave for only a minute.
L:  Mm, just long enough to get warm but -- oh.
R:  Yeah, just enough for the cheese to melt and the ho- -- meat to get hot.
L:  [MN]
R:  Not hot -- too hot that it's scalding.  Then leave it in there about a minute while you pull out your sauces and that is lunch.
L:  Let 'em dip, oh.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I make, uh, enchiladas with salsa but not much else, oh.
R:  Oh, enchiladas.  Oh, you wicked woman. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And that's my weakness.
L:  I like enchiladas, oh.
R:  Uh, uh, when I -- when I get a housekeeper finally, I'm going to hire someone who ma- -- who knows how to make good enchiladas.
L:  Cook real ones, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I love 'em.
L:  Oh.  I have a sister in law that makes it from scratch but I can't do the stuff from scratch but --
R:  Well, what -- what city are you from?
L:  Uh, Indiana, oh.
R:  Indiana?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  That's cool, that's cool, yeah.
L:  Oh, but --
R:  I have, uh -- my, uh, dad's up there from Illinois so --
L:  Mm, right next door. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh.
R:  Exactly.  Actually, um, I haven't seen my family for years so I got like their thing.  Yeah, but it's like I have -- I inherited a real healthy large strong Irish, um, you know, kind of energy level and body.
L:  Ah, okay, mm.
R:  Yeah, and a lot of testosterone helps you keep that, uh -- keep that energy level going, too --
L:  So, is your family --
R:  -- and keeps the weight off.
L:  -- from, uh, Ireland, then?
R:  Yeah, uh, actually his family's from Ireland.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  All right.  Oh.  I have a daughter just in Ireland, uh, last week, oh.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah, traveling, oh.
R:  Yeah, well that'll go ahead and, uh, keep your weight down because it's sampling all kinds of different foods.
L:  You're right.  That's what she said.  Ev- -- bread, she said everything's on bread.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Unlike bread we have here, it's, uh --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- real bread.
R:  It's a lot better.
L:  Yeah, that's what she said, oh.  Except the, uh, butter --
R:  Well, try, um -- I don't know if you got any, uh, ethnic stores but try some, uh, different types of bread, some cultural breads.
L:  Actually we do.  We have an Indian store now and I was --
R:  There you go.
L:  Yeah, that was pretty good, oh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They have some --
R:  They have some good flavors and the breads are really low in fat and a lot of min- -- lot of vitamins.
L:  Mm, is it?
R:  Lot of good stuff.
L:  Oh, it tastes very good.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  All their stuff tastes -- and then we have a, um -- like, a Caribbean store so it's kind of spicy but it's not too bad but they have a lot of different, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- especially fruits and vegetables.
R:  [SIGH] Well, you see the -- the Mediterranean or the, uh, uh -- what do you call it, uh -- they call them the, uh,  equa- -- equatorial peoples, they use a lot of spices in their food.
L:  Yeah, they must, uh -- yeah, that, uh, curry --
R:  Yeah, well you de- -- dehydrate a lot, you burn a lot more calories and you sweat more so you need those vitamins more going through your system.
L:  To push back in, okay, oh.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  Oh [NOISE] they have everything there is like curry, curry, oh, but --
R:  Oh, god, curry I can't stand.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  I'll tell you what I do like, though.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I do like jalapenos.
L:  Oh, do you?
R:  I grew up in east LA --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- in a Mexican cul- -- culture so I'll take my burrito -- oh, burrito's the perfect thing, too.
L:  [MN] [NOISE]
R:  You have the falafel, you have the sandwich --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you have the pita, the half pita, everything, not that great.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You take a burrito --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- everything's self contained.  It doesn't matter which way that sucker turns --
L:  No but now do you eat the burrito --
R:  -- before you open it up, it's -- it -- before you take a bite out of it, everything's in there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- no matter how fast you're driving, where you're going, whatever.
L:  [NOISE] Do you, uh, get 'em, uh, deep fried or non deep fried [NOISE] then?
R:  What's that?
L:  The burritos.  'Cause here we can only get deep fried [MN] which I'm -- I'm not from here [NOISE] and it always seem strange to deep fry a burrito.
R:  Deep fried?
L:  Yeah [LAUGH] that's what they do, they deep fry --
R:  God, you're --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, no wonder --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know I -- I heard, uh, I -- Indiana has a little bit of obesity problem, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's the worst way to do a burrito.
L:  Well, yeah, it's all fat.
R:  You take a fresh --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- baked, not fried --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- baked, no lard, flour tortilla --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- okay?  You put some good solid ingredients --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in there, okay?  Not a lot of junk --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just cheese, meats, uh, some beans, whatever, what have you.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You put that sucker together --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's ten times better.
L:  [NOISE] [MN]
R:  I mean, you get that little bit of flavor, the grease, but then how much do you have to drink to wash that crap down?
L:  Right, right.  Well, that -- that's what they do.  They add all that to it --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- but then they, uh, deep fry the whole sucker after it's all done. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, tell 'em -- tell 'em to -- out -- out of the fat.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Tell 'em out of the fat.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You don't want it in the fat, you don't want it in the fire.
L:  It seems like you're --
R:  Just straight.
L:  You're losing all you've gained there by the healthy choice of, uh -- [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm. [MN]
R:  You know, you -- you might be able to push 'em to go ahead and say, "You know what, I want a deep fried burrito --"
L:  Mm.
R:  "-- but I don't want it fried".
L:  Yeah, but --
R:  They'll look at you crazy --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  And --
L:  But this is what we're --
R:  And say, "Listen this is just the way -- how I want it, you know".
L:  This is --
R:  "I want a taste of -- I want to taste it" and --
L:  Have you ever, uh, heard of tenderloins?  Indiana's famous for that.
R:  Oh.
L:  They deep fry 'em. [MN]
R:  Yeah.
L:  It -- [LAUGH] oh, it's all deep fried.
R:  I can't -- you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- frying pig is just the worse thing for your body.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah, well that's one way of [LAUGH] -- we call it roadkill.
R:  Um, over here --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we got, um, some good New York steak during the holidays --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- during, like, uh, Memorial Day, we'll have it for July the fourth and for, um, uh, Labor Day.
