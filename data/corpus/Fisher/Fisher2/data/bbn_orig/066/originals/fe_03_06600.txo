R:  Hi I'm Jessica. 
L:  Hi I'm Julie.  Um, -- yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  So --  
R:  What do you think of the whole censorship thing in like school programs, um, with the book thing? 
L:  Um, well let's see I guess well -- okay so the question is like whether over not schools should prevent students --
R:  Censor --
L:  -- from reading certain books? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well I don't know.  I actually, uh, did a research paper on [inaudible] but, um, I know personally I don't think that a school should have a right to tell anyone to read whatever you know -- I mean people have the choice to read whatever they want to -- I mean maybe --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know -- I mean -- yeah -- maybe schools should --
R:  I -- I don't think like a school system has the authority to decide what kind of material the students are allowed to read.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like --
L:  Like maybe if it was an assignment a teacher ought to be careful what they assign to students but if when it comes to the students choice themselves they ought to be able to choose whatever they want to. 
R:  Yeah I mean even like younger kids like in fourth and fifth grade I understand that but like high school kids I -- I don't think that's, um, -- I just don't think it's worth [inaudible] you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah -- exactly.
R:  Because it causes too many problems.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  [inaudible]
R:  Yeah
L:  When people feel like they're being, um, I don't know like their freedom is being taken away they usually rebel more strongly than they would otherwise so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I totally agree with that I think that if they like removed the restrictions on certain things then, um, [inaudible] probably wouldn't go the way they do.  Do you know what I mean?
L:  Mhm -- yeah.  [PAUSE]
R:  This is harder than I thought it was going to be.
L:  I know.  [LAUGH]
R:  Talking ten minutes [inaudible] you think wow.  Um, [NOISE] --
L:  Is this the first time you've done this? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, it's --
R:  Is it yours? 
L:  -- my second time.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah the last subject was easier.  [LAUGH]
R:  Was what? 
L:  My last subject was easier I guess.
R:  Um, --
L:  Okay well let's see 
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  What do you think about censorship in newspapers and on TV and that kind of thing like in magazines.  Do you think that's 
L:  Um, well I guess it depends on the circumstance -- I mean everything depends on circumstances but I guess it just -- like I guess it'd be good if, um, like maybe certain things were only in certain kinds of magazines or movies and then you know like movie ratings are good for that because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- then you kind of know what's in there.  But I guess --
R:  What do you think about like, um, cutting things out of the news like the things that we see about wars going on in other countries that this country [inaudible] paid again.  Do you think they should have the right to, um, restrict what the public knows about what's going on?
L:  Um, probably not generally but I guess maybe if there are like really good reasons why we shouldn't know, like if they're afraid certain information would fall into the wrong hands you know I can understand that.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Things like kind of important top secret or it's not ready to be released yet but, um, you know generally you know I think that we should be with held from knowing anything especially if people we love and know are like involved in it and everything.  So  
R:  Like in nine eleven they -- you know -- they didn't want the public to know like certain things that were going on -- what groups were involved and what was going on and up until that point people were completely unaware of what was actually going on.  Do you think that it would of helped if other people had known what was going on? 
L:  I -- I really don't know what do you think?
R:  Like the public reaction.
L:  Well I mean I guess we might of -- well for one thing we might have been better prepared for what happened if we'd known more of what was going on but at the same time maybe you can kind of understand if they didn't want people to panic you know and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know but [inaudible]
R:  Do you think there was like a worst panic because people didn't know what was going on though?  [NOISE] 
L:  Possibly because -- yeah it just came out of the blue and we had no idea what was going to happen.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I guess -- but you know like I said we might of been better prepared if we had known we could have had the airports more guarded beforehand rather than afterwards.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So --
R:  It didn't do any good to like stop everybody randomly in airports to see what was going on after. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  It happened. 
L:  So what do you think about, um, the censorship of news and stuff? 
R:  Um, I think that like to a degree -- things -- like certain things like you say kind of maybe with held from the public.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  But it really depends I mean if it's like a story of public interest and that kind of thing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like somebody in the community is being harmed or, um, there's like a scam going on or something like that, I think the public has to right to know what's going on because if they don't know what's going on they can't protect themselves from it completely and then they just kind of defeat their own purpose of telling people about it.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  So there's really no point if you're not going to tell somebody the whole story don't tell them pieces of it because they can't do anything more with pieces than they can with nothing.
L:  Yeah that makes sense to me.
R:  Are -- like during the whole nine eleven thing or whatever, um, there was that like afterwards there was that whole anthrax scare.
L:  Right. 
R:  Everybody was -- yeah that was absolutely crazy and I -- I think that if the public had been more aware of the disease and, um, like where it was at and what was going on what was going help treat and prevent it then people wouldn't of panicked the way they did.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So I mean I guess you've got to draw a line somewhere where, um, you give too much information and people panic if you get too little information and people panic.
L:  Yeah it's kind of a balance thing I guess.
R:  Yeah and I don't think it's balanced right now.  There's quite a few things I don't think are balanced.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] The whole world is kind of off balance right now.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  I remember the like with the anthrax thing, um, I didn't even really know very much about it I kind of heard about it and I was sort of freaked out but I was like well you know nobody's going to send me an envelope full of anthrax in the mail so --
R:  Yeah and like, um, in the community where I live, um, a person in like the school administration actually got an envelope full of white powder and, um, everybody just panicked and I think that if people had been a bit more aware of like anthrax in general rather than just you know getting envelopes full of white powder people wouldn't of panicked because everybody was terrified.
L:  Yeah I remember and my next door neighbour like one night somebody came and like, um, what was it I think they used like a fire extinguisher and how it like has that white stuff come of it and they like sprayed it all over their car and we came out the next morning and it looked like they had white powder all over their car and they freaked out and called the fire department and everything but it just turned out to be a prank but it was really dumb.
R:  Oh, my god.
L:  I was like, "Whoa", I mean who would even want to do something like that.  That was just not cool to make jokes about it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but at the same time if we'd known more about it I would of known right away that it was a joke because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, somebody told me that they can't -- like the people who can make it you know they can't make more than like an ounce or something at a time anyway so there's no way --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they could cover a whole car with it so -- yeah.
R:  I -- I think like that kind of information -- if people had -- and I think part of the problem is people didn't -- they didn't want to go find the facts.  If they had gone and researched anthrax then they would of known like the kind of things that could happen and then they wouldn't -- the rumors wouldn't of flown the way they did and people would of gotten the truth like right from the beginning instead of the end where everybody is already panicked and 
L:  Yeah.  [PAUSE]
R:  How much longer do you think we have on this thing?
L:  I don't know.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We should talk more about books again though.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, let's see well -- let's see -- I don't know, um, I have never really personally had any problems with, um, you know my teacher's telling me I couldn't read certain books so I don't really read anything but like the kind of stuff my teacher's would approve of anyway so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.
R:  What do you think about like the censorship [inaudible] in other countries, people are like so limited on the things that they have available to them even like research things.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Things just aren't really available.
L:  That's really sad.  I, um, -- I don't know a lot about what goes on but yeah I do know they have a lot of restrictions just in general on lots of things that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they can't do and I think it's sad because I don't know, I'm just glad I'm American.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah like in Iraq and Iran right now think everyone decides what the public gets to hear and what they get to know and --
L:  Oh, [inaudible]
R:  And that's the kind of things that they -- they start, um, the only thing they hear over there is, um, the Americans are doing this and the Americans are doing that so automatically because they don't have enough information they concluded that the Americans are doing this and that they were doing that and nobody really knows what's going on, they just assume that they're being full on attacked.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  And -- and [NOISE] it's -- it's always that way over there.  They always have censorship on like what they're allowed to hear and what they're allowed to read and what they are allowed to know and it's -- this country's pretty fortunate because, um, there's definitely limits that the government has to their authority
