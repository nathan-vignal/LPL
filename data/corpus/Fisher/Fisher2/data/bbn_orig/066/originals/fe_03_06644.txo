R:  Hello?
L:  Hi. 
R:  Hi, this --
L:  I'm -- go ahead?
R:  This is Esther. 
L:  Hi, I'm Dianne from Virginia.
R:  Oh, dear, I'm from Michigan.
L:  Oh, really?  I'm from Michigan, too.
R:  Where are you?
L:  I'm from there, from Grand Rapids.
R:  Oh, no.  I'm not where you -- that's way far away.  That's on the other side of the state from me.
L:  Oh.
R:  So --
L:  You must be from Detroit or something like that?
R:  Yeah, around in that area.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So -- so, what -- what do you think on this censorship, on the --
L:  Oh, well, I don't know --
R:  It depends on what kind of books they are.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Some of the books today are --
L:  Some people can get picky, you know, and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and then there's some -- you know, sometimes they might be legitimate because there are some things that aren't appropriate, you know?
R:  That's what I say, some of the books today that they expect people to read aren't -- shouldn't even be on the book shelves, let alone read.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I think that the schools sh- this is in schools, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, and I think that the schools should be able to figure out which ones are good and -- it depends on the age group --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and all that, but uh --
L:  I think that, you know, they should use commonsense.  I -- I think a while back, I was hearing stuff about Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer and all that, and I think that's picking, you know?
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.
L:  That's just plain picking.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I grew up with those stories.
L:  Right.
R:  And then I'm from way back and uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- those are some of the main books and uh it didn't bother anybody back then, in -- with the language and everything today, it shouldn't bother anybody --
L:  Not on- that's for sure.
R:  -- with the way they are --
L:  But you know the kinda things that they -- like these "How To" books about how to make guns and weapons and stuff like that --
R:  Yeah, there's those --
L:  -- you know, and --
R:  Those they shouldn't allow any place.
L:  No.  
R:  But then you can go on the internet and find it anyway.
L:  Oh, yeah.  That's true.
R:  So, uh -- but uh, I think that the schools should be able to decide what and -- and they should -- if they're teachers, they should have enough commonsense to know what is right --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for or appropriate for each age group and each year.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  You know, that -- I've a granddaughter that's a school teacher.  I think she's in -- teaches, uh, second grade.  I wouldn't --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- want her job.
L:  No, I know.
R:  Not in today's world, so --
L:  Nope.  The way -- and then -- 'cause -- the parents can't discipline their kids, right, nowadays and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they just go and do what they want, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then the teachers always end up getting in trouble.
R:  And the people that complain most about censoring books are the people that don't have anything to say over -- about their kids anyway.  
L:  Yeah. 
R:  They don't control them, they don't take care of them, and yet they're the main ones that are protesting all the things that --
L:  Some of them don't even have kids.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.  But uh, I don't know.
L:  That's what I think, you know?  I -- they -- they need to use commonsense.
R:  Mhm.  I think that it --
L:  If there's something that has a lot of cuss words and you know, a lot of sexual content or something, you know, like --
R:  Then they shouldn't allow it.
L:  -- rated X stuff or -- yeah.
R:  And they should know that.  They should -- it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that you don't give these, uh, books to certain kids, to the age groups.  Even anybody in school, even the high school.
L:  Right.
R:  Shouldn't be subject to uh, books with all this sex and filth in them, that -- you know, once they get out of school, then they're old enough, they can decide for themselves.
L:  And I even wonder if they really have, um, a lot of these kind of books in school.  I -- you know, I don't see them really, you know, some things, I'm -- I haven't really heard  of, like my kids -- my kids are in high school and I never heard of them bringing home, you know, explicit books or anything like that.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  My grandchildren are out of school.  My youngest grandchild is twenty one.
L:  Oh.
R:  I'm not aware of much of what's going on in school.  I -- what I -- except for what I read in the paper, that they're opposing this or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they don't this and they don't want that, and I think that's just the do-gooders of the world, a lot of it.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  Trying to make uh, a name for themselves.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  But I think the teachers more or less have enough commonsense that they know what's appropriate for each age group and --
L:  Yeah.  I --
R:  -- let it go at that.
L:  I believe it already is censored to a point, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  As the books come in, they know if they should have them in there --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or not.
R:  Mhm.  I don't think that anybody else should have a -- uh, their say in it, unless they find out that their kids have got bad books.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That -- then -- then they have a right to complain on it, or say, "Hey, this shouldn't be there" and that, but uh, I don't think -- most of the teachers, although I read some accounts in the paper where the teachers do give out some bad books.
L:  Oh.  
R:  And different things that, uh, the kids shouldn't have.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  But, uh, that's one in, what, how many hundreds?
L:  Right.
R:  That you find do -- does that.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  So -- but I don't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- think they should make them um -- ah, mandatory censorship on a -- on a -- over the whole program.  
L:  No.
R:  I think each -- each class the teacher should have her -- enough commonsense to decide what is what.  
L:  Yeah.  You're right.
R:  But then again, who knows?  [LAUGH].  You know?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you've got, what, children in what grade?
L:  Well, I have high schools in eleventh and twelfth, and then I have kids in elementary, in fourth and second.  
R:  Uh-huh, and they don't bring home anything that's --
L:  No.  No, I never seen nothing like that.  They usually -- you know how kids are, they -- you have a hard enough time getting them to read anyway, and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- usually when they bring books home, it's -- it's because they have to read it for some kind of, uh, you know, English or something.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And they have to do some kind of a -- a test on it or a book report --
R:  A book report with it.
L:  -- yeah.  
R:  Yeah, uh-huh.
L:  And they don't likely tell them to have anything, you know -- I -- you know, just like some people, like you said, um, they make too big of a deal out of some stuff.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  You know?  Huckleberry Finn and -- and Tom Sawyer and that, that you know --
R:  That's if people have nothing else to do with their time.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  So they think, well, we'll get into this and -- and dem- or uh protest on this and have a demonstration on it or whatever --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and uh -- not demonstration, but go down and uh whatever.
L:  Well, they use race card and different stuff like that, too, you know
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  A lot of that's being used and -- and -- you have to, you know, reason with it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, some people they wrote books for certain times and certain places and it's not because they're prejudiced, it's just because that's the way things were, you know?
R:  For back then, yes.
L:  In a lot of times, I think it's good because it shows people that -- the ignorance of it, you know?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It kind of exposes it.
R:  Years ago, we had a restaurant named here, Sambo's.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I remember that.
R:  Yeah, and they made them take it out.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah, they protested, the people so much, that they had to close it.
L:  Yeah, I remember them.  Remember going there when -- when --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, when I was in Michigan.
R:  Uh-huh, and uh, they made them close.  They said that that's -- you know --
L:  Yep, yep, 'cause of the name.
R:  And I didn't see anything wrong with it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I, myself.  I thought, what's -- you know, what's the difference?  It's a restaurant.  What's the difference whether it's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- Denny's or you know, same as Denny's or anything else that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  It was just a name.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  But um, you have certain people that don't -- don't like it and uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the same as your books.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  That, uh, a lot of the books from way back --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they don't want kids reading today.
L:  Right.  
R:  A lot of them, and I don't think they're any worse than a lot of them that's being published today.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, because of --
R:  So --
L:  -- the stuff nowadays that, you know, with all this rap stuff going on and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the kind of authors that they have out nowadays --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, they can learn a lot of street stuff and bad stuff on guns and all that stuff.
R:  Or TV itself is enough to --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I'm one -- I read a lot of mysteries.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I read -- I like mysteries, Agatha Christie and those kind that um, Mary Higgins-Clark and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- [inaudible] and that, but uh, but as I say, I don't have any young enough to be in school to really know what's going on there, except what I read in the paper, that every so often something comes up that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- this shouldn't be and this shouldn't be, but I think that's going to be regardless -- there's going to be a certain amount of people no matter what it is.
L:  Mm.
R:  If it isn't books, it's going to be something else.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  That want this done and that done and --
L:  I think it has a lot to do with the way the parents teach their children, too, you know?
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  How -- how to -- you know, have a certain outlook on things.  
R:  Yeah.  And I know, I think most teachers have enough responsibility that they know what's appropriate for kids and what isn't, and take it --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  -- from there, that uh -- otherwise they shouldn't be teachers.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Or that if they -- they don't have enough commonsense to know what's right and what's wrong, for kids at whatever age they're teaching and such, but --
L:  Well, anybody that has the fortitude to be a teacher nowadays [LAUGH] they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- have to be some strong people. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  My son, he uh wants to get into something different, and he's in his mid forties and he said, "I'm going to go back and be a teacher, right, for grade school".
L:  Oh.
R:  I said, "I don't think so".
L:  Oh.
R:  "I don't think you want any part of that right now".
L:  That's a big challenge, just taking on them kids.
R:  Yes, it is.  Uh-huh.
L:  There's so -- there's so much rebellion going on, you know?
R:  Yeah, and there's so much, uh, the parents today don't have any control over a lot of -- they don't want to.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They don't supervise.  Like, years ago, your kids wouldn't be anywhere -- well, maybe they were, I just didn't realize it maybe, but not like they are today --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- without any --
L:  Walking the streets and everything.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's why, you know, people are going to be put- picking on books.
R:  Mhm.
L:  The kids -- kids need to read more.  They need --
R:  Yes, they do.
L:  -- to stay home and read a book, you know?
R:  You have that --
L:  It's good for them.
R:  -- program over there, that uh is -- what is it, twenty minutes a day?
L:  I haven't heard that.
R:  Yeah, they have it here --
L:  Oh.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  My kids do that.  That's --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  -- right, yeah, that they -- they read twenty minutes every day.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, that they have the signs out in the front of their houses and that the parents are supposed to spend twenty minutes a day with their kids to read or some adults --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that, uh -- yeah, they have that program here.
L:  Yeah, that's nice, and they always give them a little incentive.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, sometimes they come home with little Pizza Hut coupons and stuff like that.
R:  Yeah, see, I don't exactly all the progress, but I see them on the lawns and I've read about it in the paper and that, and uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but not with not having any kids that age, but I think they get a good background there of reading.
L:  Oh, yeah, and it makes you so smart, reading.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And you know, and that's why they shouldn't be so picky with it, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, because --
R:  Glad the kids are reading.
L:  They -- all they want to do is --
