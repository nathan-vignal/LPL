L:  Hello.  My name's Eileen.
R:  Hi.  This is Michael.
L:  Hi, Michael.
R:  How are you?
L:  Great.
R:  Good.
L:  How are you doing?
R:  Good.
L:  Are you in California?
R:  I'm not.  I'm in, ah, New Jersey.
L:  Oh, you're in New Jersey?  I used to live in New Jersey many, many years ago.
R:  Where did you live?
L:  Um, we lived in a city called Nutley, and also, ah, Lakewood.
R:  Okay.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I -- I know exactly where Nutley is.
L:  Oh, okay.  Nutley I didn't care for as much I did Lakewood.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Why, I can't recommend it, but, [MN] ah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah, Nutley's by, like, Inglewood, isn't it?
L:  I don't know.  I was so young -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- when -- ah, you know, when I left that, ah, all I -- I went back and visited.  It was just a -- the Lake- -- Lakewood I remember as a resort town with the lake and the woods and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, it was kind of a neat town.  Nutley just was more industrial.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So, we're supposed to decide whether we think schools should, ah --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- recommend certain books?
R:  No, be allowed to censor certain books. 
L:  Oh, to allow to censor?
R:  Yes.
L:  Well, I think -- I think it depends on the book because I think there sid -- should be some censorship if it gets, um, [LIPSMACK] too -- I'd say if the book was a little bit too controversial or, um, too sexual, or even violent.  But, I don't know what books they are considering censoring.
R:  Yeah, I -- I mean, I think there's -- there's -- there's some, ah [SIGH] [MN] [COUGH] -- I kind of have an issue with things that are -- that might be too, ah -- ah, racy or whatever.  But, I think what, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah, you know, but then you hear about this going back and saying oh that's you can't read, ah, you know, like, Huck Finn, or you can't read --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- ah, you know, Catcher In The Rye, or, um --   
L:  Well, I wonder how they even decide which --
R:  Right.
L:  -- books to -- to, ah, choose to read.  Actually my fat- -- I know one of the books that stood out and to me was -- I would -- I don't know if I would choose it -- is a book to -- for the class to read and then comment and write about.  We had to read The Scarlet Letter.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that was a very -- that's a -- [LIPSMACK] I'd say a controversial, ah, issue in a sense.  Um, and I don't know -- well, I guess that at -- at the time in school, you -- ah, students at -- at my age, they didn't question why are we reading this book, or --
R:  Or --
L:  -- you know --
R:  -- what the -- what the -- what the -- the subtext was or what, you know, some of the other themes might be.
L:  Yeah.  Um, I mean, it was difficult enough at times in English to even read, um, some of Shakespeare, but, ah, we didn't spend that much time on it.  Were you in a school where they censored --
R:  Um --
L:  -- at all?
R:  -- no.  I [MN] -- you know, but it's, ah -- there hadn't been an issue.  I was, ah -- you know, it's --it's a pre- -- where I grew up was pretty, you know -- ah, pretty liberal.  Um, I -- [MN] I'm down around Princeton, so we -- yeah, ah --
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, so, you know, it was -- it was -- it was almost, ah, going the other way, where you -- you know, they're -- you know, you can get into, you know -- like, [MN] no one really questioned it.
L: Yeah.
R:  Um, and the -- and, um, you know -- but, like you're saying, I don't think you should be -- be having, you know, erotica on the shelves or something.  Ah --
L:  No.
R:  -- or something that talks about, ah -- well, then again, you know, um --
L:  But, are they -- ah, now, is this for high school or college?
R:  I -- I think -- I think it would be -- I think it's -- I think it's, ah -- ah, high school I would say.
L:  Ah, high school level.
R:  Yeah -- yeah.
L:  Yeah, you know, it's -- it's, ah -- oh, I think -- I remember The Scarlet Letter, and I'm not sure if we did A Tale Of Two Cities or we were going to and never did.  I know we didn't do that many books, ah.
R:  Well, the other thing is I've -- I had, ah, read about, ah, schools that -- [MN] they don't want kids to read, or have a, ah -- like, Mein Kampf and -- because, you know, it's advocating, you know, the Nazi principles.  But, I think --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you -- you shouldn't -- you -- you -- you've got to be aware of what they are. Um, you ha- -- you know, discover that you can't -- you can't know what you should be on the lookout for or what people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- may be, um, [LIPSMACK] ah, trying to sell you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if you haven't -- if you hadn't seen -- seen it some place before.  And that's --
L:  Mhm
R:  -- a -- ah, I don't think [MN] -- how do you feel like something like that?
L:  I don't know.  Um, I know they're even trying to say that some of the history books need to be rewritten.  That, ah, I guess, certain overviews of some of the wars they didn't [MN] -- I guess they didn't give, um, both sides, or they didn't delve into it enough.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Or, I guess, some of the topics they even wanted taking out -- taken out.  But, um, I don't know what -- ah, how I felt.  I guess it was -- I looked at it when we had to do an assignment like that, "Okay, this is the assignment.  I've gotta read it, gotta do it".  Um, and it was almost like, um, [LIPSMACK] okay, although at the time I guess I wasn't -- well, what you'd call worldly -- I'm only in -- in high school.  But, I know I really didn't get the gist of The Scarlett Letter as to -- was it question.  And what was so funny, is one of my girlfriends was in another class or previously, and I was talking with her and she gave me the explanations.  So, when I had to stand up and give my explanation, [LAUGH] which this was supposed to be the correct explanation of whatever the question was, the teacher, um, didn't agree with me and wanted to know how I came up with that --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- conclusion --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [LAUGH] which -- which threw me.  And I just kind of flubbed[?] it.  I guess I just kind of explained it as best I could, but -- but I could tell she didn't like my explanation. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It -- it -- it wasn't part of the curriculum.
L:  No.  I don't know what she was really getting at.  I -- as far as whatever the explanation was, I thought it -- it made sense.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And she didn't like that. [LAUGH]  She didn't -- she didn't like the explanation.  But, oh censoring books --
R: [NOISE]
L:  -- um -- course I know -- didn't they take out -- even in elementary school I think they were taking out books, out of the library.
R:  Right.
L:  Ah, what was -- I remember a while back, um, talking about a few of these books, um, to be taken out of the library.  And I thought, "Why?" [LAUGH] 
R:  Right. 
L:  Those were pretty --
R:  Right.
L:  -- good books.
R:  That's the -- ah, that's the reaction -- I think it's like that kind of Huck thing -- Huck Finn thing.
L:  Was it the Huck Finn -- was it Huck Finn that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- was one of them that was taken out?  And I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- thought, "Gee, why -- why did they, ah -- why did they wanna take out that type of book?"  Um, I thought it was a e- enjoyable story -- [MN] unique.  And I can't remember what the explanation was, why they -- they took it out, and I don't know if it ever was taken out. [LIPSMACK]  But, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- how did you get th- -- how did you sign up for this?  By, um, ah, a- answering an ad in the paper?
R:  Yeah, I'd actually heard something on the radio about it.
L:  Oh, okay. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yes.  A few of my f- -- I told a few of my friends.  One of my girlfriends thought -- um, she was kind of +weary of signing up.  And I said, "Well, you're not giving out any money".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, I said, "You're not -- you're just registering to do it if -- if --"
R:  Right.
L:  But, I wasn't sure, um, when they were -- I mean, how many times in the evening that you get the calls, 'cause this is my first call.  And I signed up about three of four days ago.
R:  Yeah, they're pretty persistent.  They, you know -- you'd sign up for times of the day and then they, ah -- you kind of always -- you -- you -- you get a call, um, [LIPSMACK] just about every evening.  And then, you know, it's hardly ever a good time for me, but --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- ah --
L:  Is it -- I mean, do they do, like, on an hour, two an hour?  I mean --
R:  Oh, no.
L: -- how --
R:  No -- no.
L:  -- long have --
R:  They'll try --
L:  --you been do- --  
R:  They try once a day.
L:  Oh, it's just once a day?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.  I --
R:  Well --
L:  -- see.
R:  -- well, depending on what you signed up for, but, you know, I -- I -- I --
L:  Well, I just -- [SIGH] I signed up from six to nine.  She said it would go until ten.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I didn't know --
R:  Oh, I don't -- yeah.  That's -- that would be surprising.  I -- my experience it only been once.
L:  Once a day?
R:  Yeah.
L:  How long have you been doing this?
R:  Um, [SIGH] three weeks.
L:  Oh, for a while.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay -- okay.  So, it's --
R:  Um --
L:  -- you haven't gotten paid yet though? [LAUGH]   
R:  No -- no -- no.
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] I'm  -- I'm wondering now about the pay --
R:  Now --
L:  -- if it's --
R:  -- [MN] is it -- is yours associated with a university?
L:  Yeah, with Pen University.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  Pen.
R:  'Cause I was gonna say 'cause is with -- it's with Pen, but I didn't know how you would h- hear about it in California, but I guess they're advertising --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- it.
L:  They just ran an ad in the -- ah, one of the weekly papers that I pick up.  And I thought, "Well, why not?"  You know, it's a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- little extra cash.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, all I'm doing is watching TV, reading, you know --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I'm home.  So, I thought, "Well, I'll choose those hours".  If it -- I guess you can change 'em if it gets to --
R:  Right.
L:  -- be too bothersome.  But, nah, it's --
R: [MN]
L:  -- for ten -- yeah, and for talking on the phone ten minutes, [LAUGH] it's like the time goes by so --
