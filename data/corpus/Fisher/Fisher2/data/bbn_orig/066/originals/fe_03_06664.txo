R:  Hi, I'm Susan.
L:  Hi, I'm Sue.
R:  Hi, nice to meet you.
L:  Nice to meet you, too.
R:  [LAUGH].  Is this the fir- is this the first time you've done this?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay.  Well, I guess we should get started.
L:  Sure.
R:  Okay.  The topic was exercise.  Do you do it or not?
L:  I don't.
R:  I know.  I don't either.  I work on my feet every day, so that's how I justify not doing it.
L:  Gee, that's hard.
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  'Cause I -- I used to tend bar years ago.  And I know how hard that gets on your feet.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  And I, on the other hand, sit all day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you know, if I -- on a good day, I'll take the dog for a walk.  And that'll be about the extent of it.  I just, you know, always too many excuses to not do anything about it.
R:  Oh, exactly, and I keep saying, and I'm starting to have kind of like some nagging problems that I know if I would ex- like, back prob- like a back ache every morning, and I know if I would exercise, I bet my problem would be much better.  Because I --
L:  Yeah, prob-
R:  -- I think I would, you know, strengthen my muscles or, you know, go to a gym where they would -- ah, a personal trainer could design something for me and I -- I just like -- I don't know why I'm not doing it.  [LAUGH].
L:  Well, but see, now, I have my daughter goes to a personal trainer.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And the only reason she goes to a personal trainer is because she pays the guy in advance and she knows that if she doesn't show up, she's gonna be wasting money.
R:  Right.
L:  So that's how she gets herself to go and exercise.  I think the -- I think it costs her two or three hundred dollars a month.  
R:  Now, that's a lot of money.
L:  It is a lot of money.
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  And I -- I said, so, what do you get for your two or three hundred dollars a month, and she said, "Basically, somebody to, you know, to goad me into exercising".  Well, you know, I could think of a lot better things to do with two or three hundred dollars a month.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I have a friend that says the same thing, that the person come -- she was going to a gym and they said, "Okay, sit on the exercise bike and we'll be back in twenty minutes".  Well, she didn't think she was getting her money's worth, so then she had someone come to her home and whether she felt like it, exercising or not, the person was there, so they went ahead and did it anyway.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, and I -- I think that that's a lot -- you know, a lot of it, when I've done it in the past and I have, you know, done it off and on in the past, if I had somebody to goad me into it, or somebody who was gonna go with me or we turned it into a social event, it seemed to be easier.
R:  Right.  Right.  Yeah.
L:  There was some other motivation besides, you know, just exercising, which seems to be such a horrible thing.
R:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.  No, I have a friend that keeps -- "Well, we'll walk, we'll walk" and when I do walk, I do feel better and I don't know how old you are, but I'm old enough to know that it's starting to really stick to my hips.
L:  Oh, yeah.  You might as well just paste the food right there 'cause that's where --
R:  Yeah.  I -- just --
L:  -- it's going anyway.
R:  Just -- just apply it, yes, and uh, and it -- it always -- it'll come off there, so I'm, like, why not on a Saturday walk or, you know, in the evening when I haven't had too hard of a day, um, I'm a -- like a rep, um, in stores, so I -- the -- I -- when I'm sitting, I'm in my car and when I'm at a store, I'm on my feet and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I would say eight -- you know, eighty percent of the time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So why don't I, when I'm not too tired, you know, put a dog on a leash or get my husband and just -- even just take a walk around the block.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, that's -- that's what I do with the dog and -- and now that the weather's better, I think, well you know, there's -- you know, I don't have the rain excuse, the snow excuse, so I don't have the bundled up and mittens excuse, um, and -- and actually, there's a -- the community pool, you know, again to take away another excuse, the community pool is, like, two blocks away.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  So it -- it's hard to come up with an excuse for why I couldn't go do that.
R:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.
L:  You know?  It's not like it's across town.  I wouldn't even have to get in the car.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I would -- I would love to do -- even start doing, like, weight conditioning and training because I don't want to get what my friend calls "fingle arms", you know, when the arms flap --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- back and forwards?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And I mean, I've got all these reasons, and they're all probably vain, but you know, you're -- and I'm -- I don't know why I'm not out doing it.  I would like to join a gym, whereas I could get on some weights --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and that -- that really helps your -- your strength, which we could all use, too.
L:  Yeah, and I -- I think if I could get into the habit of doing it, you know, if -- you know, they say it takes, what, fourteen days to create a new habit?
R:  Oh, I know what you're talking about, yeah.  Something like that.
L:  If I can get into the habit of doing it, then it probably wouldn't be so much, but it's that initial push.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
L:  And I -- you know, I don't know what it's going to take.
R:  Yeah.  I think there are some people that -- for some, really feel the need to do it.  I work with a gal and she's like, "Yeah, but that's how I unwind".
L:  Yes.
R:  That she has to go and walk and, oh my God, when you walk with her, you -- you can't even keep up with her, just a --
L:  Right.
R:  -- sort of a [inaudible] you know and that's her way of -- of, I think, keeping her sanity and unwinding and -- and whatever, and she -- gets her mad because when she takes her dog, the dog walks too slow.
L:  [LAUGH]. 
R:  The husband walks too slow.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Everybody walks too slow for her.  [LAUGH].
L:  She should have my dog and I should take her dog, then we'd all be happy.
R:  Yeah.  Well, she has a beagle and he -- of course, he lives by his nose, so he's constantly, you know, sniffing or whatever.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I said, "Well, walk in the street.  That way he can't smell anything".
L:  It doesn't matter.  The street's --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- not wide enough.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  'Cause our dog stops at every tree.  She ne- she feels a -- a need to, you know -- even though it's the same street day after day after day, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  There's something new there to smell.  
R:  Of course.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Of course.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now, do you have family members that exercise?
L:  No.  Not a soul.  I mean, it's just my husband and I.  My kids are grown and gone.
R:  Right.
L:  And it's just husband and I and, you know, we -- we look at each other every now and then and say, "We really should do something about this" and you know, "Well, we'll get the dog out" and you know, walk the dog, and that'll be about it, but you know, up until recently, we were both working lots and lots and lots of hours.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And um you know, we'd get home at eight o'clock at night and it'd be all we could do to -- to manage a meal and you know, and get ready for another day.
R:  Oh, exactly.  Exactly.  
L:  And you know, now -- now I'm not working any more, I'm one of the fabulous unemployed --
R:  Oh, golly.
L:  -- and um, you know, so I -- I -- you know, I get up in the morning and, you know, we usually go to church in the morning, and get up in the morning and I think, you know, I should just stay in the car and go to the gym and I should just, you know, be at the gym for an hour every morning and --
R:  Yeah, if you're --
L:  -- you know --
R:  -- not working, that might be a way, rather than eat or str- are you stressed about -- about not working?
L:  No.  I couldn't care less.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  I'm still on the pay roll for most of the summer so this is like an extended vacation.
R:  Oh, that would be great.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you worry about it when -- when the -- when the checks -- when the checks stop.
L:  Well, then the unemployment starts, so you know, the -- the motivation to go back to work is actually probably at this point in time less than the motivation to exercise.
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  In fact, I think if I started going to the gym, I could have another excuse to, you know, not look for a job.  That's a horrible thing.
R:  Yeah, this is true.  This is true.
L:  It's a horrible thing, and -- and my son's wife is pregnant now and so now she's doing, you know, the pregnancy exercises and everything else, and the rest of us just all look at her, you know.  Of all of us that should be out exercising, she's the only one that's doing it and she's --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- you know -- she may end up shaming the rest of us --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- into something, just you know --  
R:  And she's saying, "Look at me.  If you -- if I can do this, you can do this".  [LAUGH].
L:  That's right, and she's -- she's carrying the extra, you know, basketball around with her, so --
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  -- you know?  It -- it's just hard, you know, and -- and it's not -- you know, I -- I have a problem when I, you know, go to the gym or go to those places because it seems like the people that are there have already been going there for their entire lives, and I feel like it's you know --
R:  [NOISE].
L:  -- like I'm -- you know, I weigh three thousand pounds more than all of them and, you know --
R:  Oh.  So like are you saying that the people that are working out at the gym look like they shouldn't be there anyway?
L:  That's right.  Like -- like, they don't need to be there.
R:  Right.  
L:  Right.  And so walking into that environment is like -- and -- well, plus they're all, you know, probably twenty years younger than I am, too, so that -- that doesn't help either.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We don't have a gym membership any more and I wish we did.  Bec- I think that's probably why I'm not exercising more because I think if I did belong to one, then -- then I would maybe go over there.  If I could go twice a week, I would be really happy.
L:  Yeah.  Well, they -- they have a -- they have a new women's only gym thing called Curves.  Have you heard of it?
R:  I've heard of them, but I don't know anything about them.  
L:  Um, what I've read in the -- if -- if I go and -- and join something, it will probably be this.  What I -- what I've read and seen is um -- it's first of all just women and the only commitment they ask you for is ninety minutes a week.  So they want you there three times for thirty minutes apiece and I think they pretty much ask you to kind of be consistent about when you show up so that you, like, bond with the other women that are there about the same time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So it's kind of like a group mentality, we're all going to encourage each other to do this and you know, it's okay if you can only do five minutes on the treadmill because, you know, I used to do only five minutes on the treadmill and look at me today, I'm doing ten minutes and -- and that kind of stuff, and I -- I haven't -- I haven't looked into it to actually look at the prices and stuff like that on it, but it's -- you know, it's a little bit more like a -- like a group therapy thing than just, you know, showing up and doing it by yourself.
R:  Now, do you feel you need that?
L:  Um, I -- I think I should, you know?  The doctor would -- would highly appreciate it if I'd get up and do something --
R:  Well, but I mean, but do you think you need that kind of touchy --
