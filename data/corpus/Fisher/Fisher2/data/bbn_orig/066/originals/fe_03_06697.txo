R:  Hello.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Hello.
R:  Hi, my name's Leigh.
L:  [SIGH] My name's Dorothy.
R:  Oh, where are you?  Where are you located?
L:  [SIGH] In Mississippi.
R:  I'm in Tennessee.
L:  Oh, well, that's close.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Close to Memphis, are you?
R:  Um, Nashville, actually.
L:  Nashville, oh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I was raised in Memphis. [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, it's nice out there, actually.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah. [SIGH] --
L:  [MN] Well --
R:  So, we're supposed to talk about exercise.
L:  Yes. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Actually I just -- I just [NOISE] tried to get back onto an exercise program, I'm trying -- 'cause I just got laid off from my job.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I just figured the perfect time to start --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, really -- I have [MN] all the time now, so I can do it --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- you know, before I was just, like, lazy I guess.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't know how many [MN] times I have started and just didn't follow through.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] I just don't, I -- I, um -- [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] when I was working, I guess I thought I got enough exercise, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- from my job, but, uh, [SIGH] I was a nurse, so I did, uh, a lot of walking --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and standing and [SIGH] that sort of thing, so I -- [SIGH] and it -- and then I was always tired when I got home.
R:  Yeah, that's it, uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH] So, um -- and I guess I'm not interested, uh -- I'm not on a program and I guess I'm not interested [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, so you're not working either now?
L:  -- [SIGH] in starting one. [SIGH] No, no --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm retired.
R:  Oh, okay, so how --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- old are you?
L:  [SIGH] Sixty six.
R:  Six -- I'm fifty two.
L:  Oh.
R:  So --
L:  Fifty two?
R:  Fifty two, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] Wow.
R:  [SIGH] Well, what I do is -- here's what I do, I mean, I -- and I have to force myself every single day --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's ridiculous --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, I have got all this time and I just have to force myself to do something for fifteen minutes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, what I do is I just, um -- I don't -- I don't put any pressure on myself and I just say I'm going do -- okay, I'm going to do three sets of just one muscle.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, if it's the thighs or the arms or whatever it may be, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I just do three sets of twelve and, you know, in my reasoning mind I know that that's not a lot --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I can get through it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, I don't say,  "Okay, I have to work out for a half hour" or, "I have to this or that of everything".   I just say --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I just know that I have to do those three little things --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, and it -- it seems to be getting easier --
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  -- but I still have to force myself to do it.
L:  [SIGH] But you don't --
R:  You know.
L:  -- [MN] you don't continue any further once you've reached that --
R:  Just those three sets?
L:  -- that goal?
R:  [LAUGH] No.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] That's all I do. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] And it's only be going on for, like, two weeks, though, so --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know [LAUGH] -- I just lost --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- my job two weeks ago, so  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, yeah, well --
R:  I haven't had that much time, but --
L:  -- if you get, uh, you know -- if you -- if you get into that, uh, routine and habit --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- maybe it'll continue and then you could just sort of sneak in a [LAUGH] --
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, and you know what I'm hoping?
L:  -- [SIGH] a couple more.
R:  I'm hoping that the results will inspire me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, that I'll start feeling more energy --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- and stronger and everything, you know.
L:  [SIGH] Well, -- well, that's the thing.  I do- I think -- uh, I don't -- [LIPSMACK] uh, [SIGH] I tell myself I felt better --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but I don't -- I don't know if I really did. [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, you know what?  Maybe you're not eating right, either --
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, no.
R:  -- I mean, I know you're a nurse and everything, but --
L:  No, uh-huh --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- I'm sure I wasn't.
R:  Yeah, and I've got on a, [MN] uh, a different, um, plan too 'cause I never, uh, was a big, um, either a big meat eater or, like, a protein eater, I was always --
L:  Right.
R:  -- just fruits and -- you know, fruits and bread really [LAUGH] --
L:  Right, uh-huh.
R:  -- [LAUGH] cereal, [SIGH] you know, [SIGH] and I've been trying to just do some reading and stuff on the latest, um, you know, information and they're saying [SIGH] to make sure you get just a small amount of protein with every meal and especially in the afternoon --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you know, and that seems --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to be helping 'cause I don't feel tired --
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- all the time from -- you know, after --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I eat.  
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, I --
R:  Before, whenever I ate I would just want to take a nap.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah, it is supposed to give you energy, but, uh, [SIGH] I've sort of, um [MN] -- my daughter's a vegetarian and just [MN] -- I don't know with [SIGH] -- within the last few months I've just -- I don't -- I'm just not a -- a meat eater --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- anymore. [SIGH] But, um --
R:  It's hard to find protein foods --
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  -- if you don't -- you know, if you're not a meat eater.
L:  yeah, well, I'm -- [MN] eggs and -- you know --
R:  Yeah, eggs, nuts --
L:  -- things like that, yeah.
R:  -- you know, maybe some low fat cheese or --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] I've been getting into the Soya milk.
L:  Oh.
R:  That's, uh -- you know, it took me a while to get used to it, but it's not bad.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  [SIGH] Um, I d- I do, um, you know, eat fish and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- stuff like that, but, uh [SIGH] -- but, um, I don't -- I don't guess -- see, I guess I'm pas the stage of [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- considering exercise --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- as a part of my daily routine, but, uh --
R:  Oh, you shouldn't be, you're only sixty --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- what? [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, yeah, sixty six next --
R:  You could have, like, another --
L:  -- I'm pretty --
R:  -- thirty years, girl, so [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [LAUGH] you --
L:  And you know I think about that sometimes --
R:  You know.
L:  -- I --
R:  Really?
L:  [SIGH] Really, and it's -- and it's not, uh, unusual for people [SIGH] to live into their nineties now --
R:  That's right, that's right.
L:  -- and of course the [MN] -- you know, when -- when I was, uh, much younger I -- you -- you just [SIGH] -- you know, your life expect- if you were eighty you were an old person.
R:  Yeah, that's right.
L:  So -- but now it's, uh, um -- the life span's really --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] increased and I'm not sure -- I guess, um, [MN] better health care w- w- maybe would be the primary --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] um, reason, but, um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah, yeah, 'cause if you're seventy five, okay now, that's not that far off for you really --
L:  Mm mm, mm mm.
R:  -- you know, when you think about --
L:  No, no.
R:  -- the -- how fast the past -- well, how fast the past ten years went --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and do you want to be sitting around and, like, weaker than you are now --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- or do you want to be at least as good as you are now?
L:  [SIGH] Well I g- I d- I do, um -- uh, I shouldn't, uh [MN] -- I -- I -- I shouldn't call it exercise, but --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [SIGH] I d -- I -- I do have a paper round.  Can you believe that? [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.
L:  [SIGH] And I love it.
R:  Oh.
L:  I just -- [SIGH] it's just so much fun and -- and [MN] [SIGH] it -- it's a -- you know, it's -- it's sometimes work but --
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  -- for the most part I -- it's in a -- it's a rural route [SIGH] and so I -- I drive, of course, I don't --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  -- walk and carry a bag, but [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, right, like the old days.
L:  [SIGH] Mm, yeah, [SIGH] but, um --
R:  [MN] Riding your bike --
L:  -- but I -- I love that.
R:  -- throwing the papers on the lawn. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, so, at least your moving, you know.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, right.
R:  I think that's the key.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  That too many people are just sitting around on the couch --
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, now --
R:  -- you know.
L:  -- I -- I -- I keep busy, you know --
R:  yeah, yeah.
L:  -- all day.  I -- I have something to do all the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- time it seems like, but, um --
R:  I mean, my mother, god bless her --
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- she's --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- eighty something.  She's eighty two, I think.
L:  Oh.
R:  And she has -- I mean, she has a better social life than I do.
L:  Is that right?
R:  She gets up at, uh -- every morning she gets up and she gets dressed and does her face, whatever she has to do regardless of whether she's going out or not --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, this way, if something comes up --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- she's ready.
L:  She's ready to go, huh?
R:  And she doesn't feel like she's just moping around the house --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and she has a routine, like, Monday she cleans the house --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- Tuesday she visits her sisters, Wednesday she goes and gets her hair done and socializes with that crowd, you know --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- and -- and all week long, every day, she has something planned that she has to do --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, you know, kind of routine, but at least she's moving and she's out of the house and she keeps herself occupied, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And me, I've been off for two weeks --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I've been in the house for two weeks.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, god. [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, I mean, I go --I'll go out and do my errands and things but I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'm so bored.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  [SIGH] Well, what, um, did you -- was it just a [MN] general [MN] work reduction, or [MN] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- was --was it --
R:  Yeah, pretty much.  
L:  OH, my.
R:  I think they just actually did away with the position all together.
L:  Oh.
R:  Oh, well, you know what I did?  I worked for -- did you ever see on TV the guy that goes, "Can you hear me now?"  That --
L:  The what?
R:  -- that [inaudible] and wireless --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- that goofy guy on TV?
L:  Uh, I think so, yeah.
R:  Yeah, he -- he goes around, w- "Can you hear me now?"
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's what I did.
L:  Oh.
R:  Except obviously we did it in a car, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, so I drove -- actually drove seven states and all I did was sit in a car all day.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, my.
R:  So I really need the exercise.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] Well --
R:  But --
L:  -- I suppose that was a blow to you, huh?
R:  [SIGH] It was.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- because they gave me no notice --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, my --
R:  -- at all.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, it was just one day I was working and the next day they said, "Turn the keys in and you're out of a job".  You know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- basically. [SIGH] So --
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, that's -- you know, that's one of those, uh, real high stresses in life, like, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- death and -- and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- uh, other [SIGH] things --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so that's -- that's hard.  So, it's good -- [SIGH] you know, one -- one thing I did find [MN] when -- when I attempted to exercise was that it [SIGH] -- it, um -- it changed my state of mind to a -- to a degree, you know, I w-
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I was a -- [SIGH] I -- I, uh, just felt better --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- about myself and, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and -- and just was in generally a better mood.
R:  Yeah, I have to agree with --
L:  M-
R:  -- you there, because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- even though I feel kind of like a slug laying -- you know, staying around the house for two weeks --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- whenever I -- even though I have to force myself to do that exercise --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- when I'm done I'm, you know, A --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I'm proud of myself --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that I actually --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- did it.
L:  Right.
R:  And B I know I'm doing something good for myself that I know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that if I can stick to it, even if it's just -- [SIGH] the way I reasoned it was, even if it is only fifteen minutes a day [SIGH] it's more than I was doing before --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, whereas --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- before I was doing nothing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So I -- I have to see some improvement, it only stands to reason, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there has to be some improvement.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] So.
L:  [SIGH] Well, I think it -- it -- it, uh, uh -- if -- if nothing else, it does wonders for your, um, m- mental, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- status, because, [SIGH] um, uh, it's supposed to get the endorphins [SIGH] you know, uh, uh, m- moving and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, uh [SIGH] -- and for that reason you -- you have a -- a -- an increase in your, uh, you know, emotional [SIGH] --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- or mental, um, state, but [SIGH] -- but it -- I -- I'm not sure that -- that it, um -- i- i- i- if it wasn't -- [MN] uh, the times that I exercised, that's what kept me going, because I really didn't see any, um, real drastic change in --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] you know, in body shape --
R:  Now, what kind of exercise we --
L:  -- or weight loss --
R:  -- were you doing?
L:  -- or -- [SIGH] uh, walking, I walked --
R:  Just walking, okay.
L:  -- and then I, um [LIPSMACK] --
R:  And that's supposed to be one of the best exercises.
L:  Yeah, uh-huh. [SIGH] And -- and -- and when I did that and -- and would walk two miles, I just thought that was really something. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [SIGH] And I felt so m- so good afterwards.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] And, um, I di- I [MN] -- I joined the -- the Y and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and would go down and walk out on their equipment and [SIGH] whatnot. [SIGH] But I did, um -- I have to say, uh, um, after a time, um, doing that I -- I had a -- [SIGH] I fell in my bathroom and -- and broke, um, [LIPSMACK] uh, [MN] crushed to one of the
R:  Oh, yikes.
L:  -- vertebras in my back. [SIGH] 
R:  Ooh.
L:  So, that -- that sort of, um, you know, keeps me from doing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- too much now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um --
R:  Did that heal up pretty qu-
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- well, though?
