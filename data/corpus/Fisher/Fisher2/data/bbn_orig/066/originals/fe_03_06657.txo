L:  Hi, I'm Janey.
R:  Hi, I'm Pam.  Are you on a cell phone as well?
L:  No, I'm on a -- a normal phone actually.
R:  Oh, okay.  They just asked what type of phone you were on, so I didn't know if they tried to pair people with the same phone.  I'm actually driving in for a car pool --
L:  [NOISE].
R:  -- to pick up my oldest child.
L:  Oh, I got my two babies right here.  [LAUGH].
R:  Well, I have my two smaller ones in the back seat behind me.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I'm now a driving hazard.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  I know that feeling.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I got four boys in total so --
R:  I have three.  I'm -- I'm sympathetic to you.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  So, do you exercise?
L:  Yeah, I walk every day with my, uh, kids and my husband.  
R:  Oh, congratulations.  I wish I could do that.
L:  [LAUGH] well, he --
R:  My husband is a runner and he runs an hour a day and I have always said, you know, maybe one day I'll be able to do it with him, but that day never comes.
L:  Oh, I know that feeling.  My husband actually at -- um, I had to twist his arm to go walking.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Well, he's the one that works.  I'm -- I'm at home all day with the kids, so --
R:  That's how I am.
L:  -- I don't -- I go nuts.  I have to go out.
R:  Well, [inaudible] he'll take the two youngest ones out with him running, but I still wish it could be me out there doing it, not him.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I know that feeling.  And I also -- like my uh my fifteen year old son lives, uh, elsewhere, but my eleven year old son, he's very active too.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, and I have a twenty two month old and a five month old.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So there's not much those two do --
R:  No.  My two youngest are about twenty seven months and nine months.
L:  Oh.  So you know exactly what I'm going through?
R:  I know exactly what you're dealing with.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, yeah. 
R:  It -- it does get better.
L:  Oh, I hope so.  They're both in --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- diapers and it's driving me bonkers.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yep.  But as far as, you know, I've -- I was active as a child, exercise wise --
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- and I guess as a young adult and then as I got older, it just kinda stopped.
L:  Yeah, as soon as you have children, it stops.
R:  It does.  You -- there -- it's the one thing that you seem to be able to put further and further back on the list of things to do. 
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  And every -- every new year it seems like I make the same resolution that, you know, thirty minutes a day and then by January third, it's gone.
L:  Well, actually all you have to do is just do a little bit of walking every day.  It's not -- it's -- it doesn't seem like exercise, but it is.
R:  That's true, and I suppose picking up the little ones, we get enough of the deep knee bends and what not.
L:  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.
R:  Work out that way.  You work out your arms all day long with -- with children, but --
L:  Yeah, and cleaning the house.  That's cardiovascular.
R:  That's true.
L:  And then when you got one hitting the other, you're running and [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  There you go.
R:  You're running and chasing and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Exactly.  And stretching when you have to put the things that they can't get to on top of the refrigerator.
L:  Yes.  [LAUGH].
R:  So, I guess then the answer is "yes", we all do exercise a little bit.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  We may not realize it, but we do.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, I just -- I wish I could be as disciplined as -- as you say you are.  You know, doing it --
L:  Well, we just -- we just started doing this.  We have, like ah, we just started doing the walking every day after he gets home from work, so --
R:  Oh.  Well, that -- keep it up.  My husband does it every night when he comes home from work.  First thing he does is go out and run for an hour.
L:  Well, tonight I don't think we're going to be able to.  It's raining outside.
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH].  
R:  No.
L:  I'm not going to take the babies out in the rain.
R:  No.  I wouldn't do that either.
L:  No, I don't need them sick.  [LAUGH].
R:  No, not just for the sake of exercise.  [LAUGH].
L:  No, no.  Oh, they're cranky enough without being sick.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Bless you.  I know exactly where you are.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  
R:  But what kind of sports do your kids do?
L:  My -- well, my eleven year old, he's into playing football, baseball, soccer, you name it, he's into it.
R:  Is he?  My --
L:  Yeah.
R:  My nine year old plays soccer and tries to play basketball.  He's kinda short and petite built, so basketball's not his thing, but soccer, he -- 
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's like my eleven year old.  He's short, like his mommy.  
R:  Yeah, that's -- that's it.  They inherited it from me.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Well, I figure he'll get his growth spurt soon enough.
R:  That's right.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I keep saying he won't go to college four feet tall.
L:  No.  [LAUGH].
R:  He'll -- he -- he will grow a little bit.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yep, they do.  They do grow.  
R:  And your fifteen year old, does he play sports?
L:  Um, well, the last time, my aunt told me he did.  [LAUGH].
R:  Mm.
L:  He lives with my aunt, so --
R:  Okay.  
L:  Yeah.  He's uh -- he's on the Dean's list and everything.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah.  I don't know if they told you or not, I live in Canada.
R:  Oh, do you?
L:  Yes.  Now --
R:  I live in Alabama.
L:  Oh, wow.  [LAUGH].
R:  So you're dealing with cold rain and I'm dealing with hot humidity.  [LAUGH].
L:  Um, I wish I was.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  
L:  It's been so --
R:  I can im- I can relate.  We -- we wish for it every time it drops below about fifty in the winter, which I know is nothing for you.  
L:  I don't know what that means in -- like, we don't --
R:  [COUGH].
L:  -- have fahrenheit.  We have Celsius, so [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, okay.  I can't convert.  [LAUGH].
L:  Me either.  'Cause right now I think it's sixteen Celsius right now.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So.
R:  And we're at eighty fahrenheit, whatever --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- that is. 
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Sounds hot, doesn't it?
L:  I have no idea.  Maths is too much exercise for me.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yep.  
L:  But yeah, my ah, my oldest son lives in Pennsylvania with my aunt.  
R:  Oh, well, that's nice.
L:  Yeah.  I'm -- I was born in the States.  But I do -- I do a lot of fishing with my husband and that in summer.
R:  Do you?
L:  Yep.
R:  My husband does a lot as well.  We --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  His parents have a -- a house that's down right on the water here, right on the Gulf, and he loves to go down there and -- and fish off the end of the pier and I think it's kinda therapy for him.
L:  Right.
R:  Just to sit there and watch the water for a while.  [LAUGH].
L:  Ah.  Well, my husband got me into fishing.  Like, I've been married almost -- well, I've been married two years, we've been together three.  And the two babies are his and my eleven year old and my fifteen year old aren't.
R:  Right.
L:  But uh, he uh, he got my eleven year old and me into fishing and he's still trying to get me to bait a hook and I won't.  [LAUGH].
R:  No, I refuse, and I -- I won't take the fish back off, once you catch it.  That's his job, too.
L:  Yeah, yeah. 
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  That's his job, too.  Well, my husband doesn't mind as long as I -- you know, it's something for us to do together, right?
R:  That's right.  That's right.
L:  And so he's got to understand that.  I won't touch it.  He knows that I'm just -- I'm afraid of worms.
R:  Well, I don't blame you there.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, that's my mother's fault.  She used to pull them apart and throw them at me.
R:  Worms are nothing but miniature snakes.  
L:  Oh, I don't mind snakes.
R:  As far as I'm concerned.
L:  Snakes don't bother me.  
R:  That's --
L:  Especially when you got boys around the house, you kinda get used to it.
R:  Well, my oldest is into frogs.  He's catching frogs now.
L:  Ah. 
R:  So we've had our share of frogs, but --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so far he is just as squeamish over snakes as I am.  [LAUGH].
L:  That's odd for a boy.
R:  I know.  
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I know.  [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.  But you guys live close to a stream and that, where they can go down and play?
R:  We are -- our house is on a bay that leads out to the Gulf of Mexico.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  So, we've -- although we don't really have true waterfront property, right down the street from us there's a little community pier and all the kids can go down there and they can play and swim and as long as everybody's watchful for alligators, we're okay.
L:  Oh, wow.  I -- alligators?  Wow.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Well, I guess the extent of, uh, dangerous animals around here would be maybe a mouse.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  In the area I live in.  [LAUGH].
R:  I have never been to Canada.
L:  Uh, oh it's beautiful country up here.  Like, I was, like, I -- I was born in Baltimore but raised up here so I had the best of both worlds.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah, my mom was the American, my dad's Canadian.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  [LAUGH].  So I have dual citizenship.
R:  Wow.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  That's -- that's interesting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  My -- my dad was in the Army and we lived in Belgium when I was small and his best friends, who -- his best friend was in the Air Force, he was in the Canadian Air Force.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  So we had some Canadian friends for a while, but just never made it back to their house, to visit.
L:  Oh.  Sorry, I'm just trying to get the baby to stop crying.  He wants --
R:  Oh, I understand.
L:  -- looks like he's about to cry.  Oh --
R:  Trust me, I understand.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Okay, honey.  Shh, shh, shh, shh.  He just whacked himself.  
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH].  There's exercise right there.
R:  Bless his heart.
L:  [NOISE].  [LAUGH].  Oh.  Yours are awfully quiet.
R:  Well, I think they're trying to go to sleep.
L:  Oh.
R:  Usually on this ride in to -- to do car pool for my oldest child, I can get one of them asleep.  [LAUGH].
L:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE].  I do -- I -- I know with the walking, I do a lot of that around here, just carrying the baby alone.
R:  Exactly.  It's amazing how many laps you can make in your house in a day.  
L:  And you think you'd lose weight from it, but you don't.
R:  You don't.  
L:  [LAUGH].  
R:  I know that feeling too.  
L:  And constantly cleaning.  You'd think you'd lose weight from that, you don't.  [LAUGH].
R:  No.  Well, I know it's -- whatever they munch on and their snacks are, as I'm cleaning it up and putting it away, I -- I seem to get a few of them myself.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  So -- 
L:  Uh, not me.  My ah --
R:  When they snack, I snack.
L:  My twenty two month old, he's in there like a dirty shirt and he takes it all.
R:  Ooh.  
L:  He's a big boy.  Takes after his daddy.
R:  Well, very good.  
L:  He takes after his daddy, don't you?  Get that out of your mouth.  Oh.  This is what I get, he's got -- he has a little ball in his mouth now.  Argh. 
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Andrew.  Andrew.  [NOISE].  Okay, honey.  I just put the --
R:  It's amazing what they can find so quickly.
L:  Oh, yes.   Oh, yes.
R:  My nine month old has just started crawling really well.
L:  Ah.
R:  And he can find the smallest speck of dirt anywhere in the house and it immediately goes in his mouth.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I know --
R:  So we --
L:  -- that feeling.  [LAUGH].
R:  We have really had to be really diligent with keeping it clean lately.
L:  Mm.  Oh, yeah.  And then you got to baby proof the house and --
R:  Oh, yes. 
L:  Yeah.  Well, the -- the babies that I have here are my husband's only children.  He's never had -- never been around --
