R:  Hello?
L:  Hello!
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  Um, my name is Gina.
L:  I'm Janice.
R:  Hi, Janice.  How are you?
L:  I'm okay.
R:  Um, --
L:  I live in Lake Charles.  Where are you from?
R:  I live in, um, New Jersey, um, --
L:  Well, I guess I have to tell you where Lake Charles is, it's Louisiana.
R:  Ah, okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] you're probably, like, Lake Charles, never heard of it.
R:  [LAUGH] right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, --
L:  I didn't hear the topic so, I missed that. 
R:  The --
L:  What was it?
R:  The topic was, um, it was, um, does private and parochial schools have the right to limit the b- -- the books that the children can read?  Um, --
L:  To limit them?
R:  Meaning, like, uh, the types of books.  I -- I think what they're referring to is, um, content, you know, are some books inappropriate to be read --
L:  Shoosh, I have no idea.
R:  -- uh, by subject matter.
L:  Hm.  Like, where they just tell 'em you have to read this certain specific book?
R:  Well, I -- I think it's more, like, well, you know, we're not going to stock this certain book in this library because we don't think it's appropriate.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Ah, so, I think it has to do with, maybe, ah, the subject of freedom of, um, freedom of speech, maybe, or --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- freedom of the press, or, --
L:  Excuse me.
R:  -- um, and, you know, I guess, whether or not there should be books of, um, maybe, religious content in public schools, --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- um, I personally think that, um, because it's, ah, children, that, you know, there probably are certain, you know, um, maybe, books that, oh, I can't think of any off the top of my head, but there are probably certain books that are inappropriate for children.  Um, but then again, you know, I mean, at home, the parents can monitor that; someone has to monitor that, --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- I believe, at school.  Um, I -- I think that they could probably monitor, um, I think they do to an extent give them a -- a group or section that they can choose books from, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, you know, and I'm sure they don't have anything, you know, -- um, I -- I guess in private schools they probably have more of a say as to what books they can and can't, given anything private, I think, has more leeway as to what they can restrict, --
L:  Yeah.  Well, in private schools they have, --
R:  I don't know, what do you think?
L:  -- like, at my church library, they only have religious books, or something about religious books, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- somewhere in there is religion, so, and, in public schools, I'm not really -- I don't even really remember, it's been so long, but they didn't have anything inappropriate, which was good, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- 'cause I mean, we have would have got The Anarchist's Cookbook, if we could have, you know, or the ba- -- the people that are, you know, into bad things would have just gotten more books about the bad things that they were interested in, and lead them in the wrong direction there too, so, I think it's -- I think it's all right, I think they do -- they do a good job already with what they're putting in there, to -- uh, I don't know, you want something that's kind of motivational or something, or some kind of -- I don't know, you could also put some books about people's lives that had problems, so that they could see what it's like, maybe a couple, you know, like, realistic stories about life, 'cause, I mean, you don't know anything about life until you get out there, so, maybe that, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but, ah, [MN] they do need to definitely monitor it.
R:  I -- I think so, too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I -- I think in schools, I could see where, you know, outside of school, you know, basically you have the freedom to read whatever you want, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, but, you know, as far as minor children, I -- I do think there's a sort of responsibility to sort of, um, make sure that books that maybe have inappropriate language, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or, you know, even just anything with their -- a racy subject matter, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, I -- I don't believe even with the, you know, freedom of, you know, that kids can do that on their own! [LAUGH] I don't think they need to get, um, access to that at school.  
L:  Yeah, oh, definitely.
R:  Yeah, so, you know, I think that, um, I think for both, public, I mean, I know public school, you know, has a lot of rules, you know, as far as, ah, no, you know,  religious sort of connotation, um, --
L:  -- they really do?  It's just that --
R:  -- Well, I, you know, um, I think they do -- I -- I don't know that maybe they, um, limit the books, I -- I know that they, obviously can't, you know, pray or whatever, but, um, you know, my children go to public school, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I mean, they -- they do read, I -- I -- they don't really have any books about reli- -- I mean, holidays are about the only thing, and -- and basically, they -- they do all of the holidays, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, as far as books, ah, I've seen, you know, books on Hannukah, and, you know, Christmas and -- and such, but other than that, I don't believe that their library probably has books on, um, you know, Jesus, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, um, I'm sure it doesn't -- I'm sure they don't stack, you know, religious stories, um, --
L:  That's not good, though, --
R:  Well, --
L:  -- I mean --
R:  I think -- I don't think that they can, I -- I think because of the separation of, you know, church and state, I -- I think that that's, you know, we hear on the news that they're having debates about having plaques off walls that show the Ten Commandments outside of a, um, a state building, and you know, I don't believe, that's probably something I should probably ask about, but I don't think that they have religious books at their public school, I believe that they probably --
L:  But those are the best ones you could read, 'cause they don't have any -- they're really motivational stories and they -- and they tell you about life, and, you know, all kinds of things, from what I read, out of my -- like, the Bible and stuff like that.
R:  Yeah, but I believe their access to that would be --
L:  I'm not really religious, but, yeah --
R:  -- through, um, the CCD program, --
L:  Yeah, --
R:  -- and through whatever other religious education program, um, they would get.
L:  -- that's out of school.
R:  Yeah, so, um, not to mention, you know, I mean, I think we're both in agreement, as far as other subject matter, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, but, yeah, I mean, you know, I went to a -- a -- a private, uh, grade school, -- um, Catholic grade school, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and of course, you know, we had books on saints, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for that matter, but I doubt very highly that my kids have books on saints in their school library.
L:  Definitely don't.
R:  So, I -- I think that's, no, I -- I would highly doubt it.  Um, you know, other subject matter, though, I think they should be able to read about, you know, um, controversial subjects, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and my daughter's brought home books about, you know, black slaves and -- and such, and, um, you know, and I do believe, you know, they're realistic, and -- and they can learn from real life stories, I mean, um, so, other than, I guess, pornography, and, ah, you know, something, um, I guess, you know, with bad language or something of that nature, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah, I don't know, so, you know, I think that they really should have a say --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- in what books.  [LAUGH] I think the original que- -- what was the original question?
L:  I don't know.
R:  I -- I think it was, you know, should public and private schools have a say in the books, ah,  that children are able to read, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, so, I think that they should.
L:  Yeah.  Me too.
R:  -- I -- I know that's partly censorship.
L:  Why, though?
R:  -- by their monitoring that, but, I'm okay with that.  [LAUGH]
L:  Censorship.  What is that about?
R:  Censorship is, um, where they are [NOISE] excuse me one second.  All right.  Um, what was I saying?  Um, --
L:  Censorship, what was that?
R:  Censorship is where they actually are able to restrict, uh, exposure to certain things, whether it be books or movies, or -- you know, it's where they're censoring out, you know, what is deemed inappropriate, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and what is deemed inappropriate in one culture may not be necessarily deemed inappropriate in another culture, I mean, I would think that, you know, strict religious, um, you know, private schools, would deem a lot of, probably what kids in our public schools are able to, you know, read, I mean, --
L:  Well, me, --
R:  -- as far as strict, meaning, that, you know, --
L:  When I was in public school, I only got poetry books, and I got
