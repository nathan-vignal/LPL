R:  [LIPSMACK] Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  [SIGH] Hi, this is Jamie.
L:  Hi, I'm Cheryl.
R:  [SIGH] How are you doing?
L:  I'm good.
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] So --
L:  Uh, what was the topic?
R:  [SIGH] Exercise.
L:  Do we exercise regularly.
R:  Do we need to exercise. [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Uh, no. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] No. [LAUGH] [SIGH] Oh, I walk a lot. 
L:  I walk a lot through school.  I'm a teacher and --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- my campus is huge.
R:  [SIGH] Oh, you -- you work at a college?
L:  Uh, no, I work at a high school.
R:  Oh, my god. [LAUGH] 
L:  The campus is just that big.
R:  God bless you. [LAUGH] [SIGH] As three -- as a mother of three, um, [LAUGH] I can tell you schools are -- [SIGH] if you're in the Philadelphia area, schools are [LAUGH] different.
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  [SIGH] Uh, [MN] is your high school in the Philadelphia area?
L:  [SIGH] No, south Florida.
R:  Oh, okay, okay.
L:  Not necessarily a better place than Philadelphia.
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] Oh, I -- I didn't know if this was local or not, so this is -- this is interesting.
L:  [SIGH] No, it's national. [NOISE] 
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, it's national?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh. [SIGH] So, I think my -- my exercise is walking, and would I decide to go any further, I do not think so. [LAUGH] 
L:  Mm.
R:  [SIGH] And yourself?
L:  [SIGH] I started exercising last summer, actually [NOISE] getting kind of serious about it, at least walking on a treadmill.
R:  [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] Okay.
L:  Um, but one day I went down -- there's, um, like, a community center here --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- where I live, [SIGH] so there's no cost or anything, it's all built in.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, nice.
L:  And, uh, so I went down there just to be able to -- well, at least every other day, sometimes more often [SIGH] during the summer, and then school started, and I tried to keep it up and [SIGH] just couldn't.  Had too many things going on.
R:  [LIPSMACK] You really have to commit --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- some time [MN] to [LIPSMACK] the exercising.  You really have to carve out some time.
L:  Yeah, but it got to the point where I didn't have time to sit and eat dinner, never mind go some place to go walk or --
R:  [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] Do you have a hectic schedule?
L:  I did when school started, it's starting to ease up now.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  Um --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- I teach fulltime day, [LIPSMACK] day's high school.
R:  Okay, oh, [SIGH] god bless you. [LAUGH] [SIGH] Up here it's -- it's really -- y- you try to get your children into private schools if at all possible here. [SIGH] 
L:  Well, I would do that here.  I moved to Florida not realizing what the education system was like down here.
R:  [SIGH] Uh, wh- where did you originally I mean --
L:  New York.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, that s --
L:  New York City.
R:  -- that's the accent I'm detecting.
L:  Uh, okay.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, you still have a little bit of it left.  I have friends in New York area.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, you still have a little bit of that gruffness left.
L:  Gee, I though I got rid of that.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  I [MN] worked on that when I lived in New York.
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  Getting rid of that.
R:  -- you're not doing the "yo" thing.
L:  Sorry?
R:  You're not doing the "yo" thing. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, gosh, no, that's New Jersey.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, that's right, New Jer- Jersey. [SIGH] But, yeah, not, they're s-
L:  Well, if the want to -- if they want to analyze speech patterns we're giving them a good one, right?
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] Well, they -- they told me when I called -- 'cause I actually picked the Village Voice up in New York and this is where I found the ad --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- [SIGH] and I thought it was funny because it said -- it -- coming out of the University of Pennsylvania and I live in Florida -- I mean, I live in Pennsylvania, I'm sorry, you live in Florida. [SIGH] 
L:  Okay, you were getting me confused for a second there.
R:  Yeah, no, I live in Philadelphia, which I thought was funny, since it was coming out of the University of Pennsylvania --
L:  U.P., yeah.
R:  -- and I picked it up in a [SIGH] New York paper. [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, a friend of mine had told me about it and said, "Why not try it?"  Like, "Okay, yeah, I guess".
R:  [SIGH] Uh, this is different, this is different.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] You know, I though it was -- you know, I thought it might have been a gimmick or something, but I had somebody check into to it and they said, "Oh, no, it's very legit, give it a shot". And I said, "Ah, okay". [SIGH] You know, but they were kidding me on -- when I was interviewing, [SIGH] they said something [SIGH] about [SIGH] Philadelphia says "water" like "wooder" W.O.O.D.E.R. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.
R:  [SIGH] Instead of the "water" [LAUGH] --
L:  Uh-huh, well, yeah --
R:  -- you know.
L:  -- people talk differently from different parts of the country.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um I can't get my kids to understand that, 'cause I teach sign language.
R:  Oh, interesting.
L:  So they keep -- th- they see me sign something --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they see my assistant in the classroom sign the same thing but differently, [SIGH] "Well, one of you must have signed it wrong 'cause you didn't do it the same way".
R:  [SIGH] Oh.
L:  Now, teaching in south Florida, I teach in an inner city school --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and the kids don't talk down there like they do in Philly.
R:  [LAUGH] I would imagine.
L:  I would imagine even inner city -- the inner city they don't talk the same.
R:  [SIGH] Oh, lordy, no. [LAUGH] 
L:  And, you know, have you guys ever -- you know, what's your word for grandma?  Well, my family called her grandma, some families --
R:  [SIGH] Oh, up here we have --
L:  -- call her granny, some --
R:  -- [SIGH] we have grammy. Um, in the --
L:  Well, there's a --
R:  Polish community it's botchy. [SIGH] um, gran- yeah, there's grandma, mummum --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- mummum is really pretty prevalent up here.
L:  [MN] Midwest, my girlfriend's called Mima.
R:  Mima, yeah. [SIGH] Yeah, there's all those different ones for grandmother.
L:  Well, just the same way as there are different words for soda.
R:  That's right.
L:  Call it pop or coke if you're from Atlanta.
R:  Or the hoagies. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, subs.
R:  [SIGH] Or subs, you know what I mean? [LAUGH] 
L:  Grinder.
R:  [MN] Grinders. [SIGH] That's actually heated hoagie, you know, [SIGH] but yeah --
L:  Oh, well. [LAUGH] 
R:  actually, the original word was "huggie".
L:  Huggie?
R:  Because the hoagie was originated, um, [SIGH] for the men that used to work on Hug Island which was an island in the Delaware.
L:  Oh, okay, that's --
R:  U, or from --
L:  -- news for me.
R:  -- South Philadelphia. [SIGH] So, they would make the sandwich, uh, for the men who worked on Hug Island --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- so originally it was called [NOISE] huggies --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- for the men who worked on Hug Island --
L:  I wonder how they got --
R:  -- on Hug Island and then they became hoagies.
L:  -- I wonder how they got the variations like grinder --
R:  [SIGH] [MN] 
L:  -- in Connecticut and --
R:  -- [SIGH] yeah, well, they're -- they're -- in Philadelphia, grinder is actually a heated hoagie.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  You know, [SIGH] I remember the one time [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] I had gone, um, [SIGH] upstate in Pennsylvania and I had to ask for a steak sandwich and this is way back in the seventies --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- early seventies [SIGH] and they -- they came out with this ridiculously high price that -- that was like thirteen dollars or something and I was like --
L:  That gives you a steak on bread.
R:  [SIGH] They literally took a whole steak and [LAUGH] put it on the bread, you know, an I'm like --
L:  And you were talking --
R:  -- "No, no, ch-"
L:  -- about this Philly thing, right?
R:  Chip steak, yeah.
L:  Philly cheese steak.
R:  I was like, "Chip steak" yeah. [SIGH] They actually put cheese on -- on a [MN] -- a [MN] sirloin or something. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, gosh.
R:  [MN] [LAUGH] [SIGH] I laughed so hard I couldn't stop.  I was like, "No wonder you charged me thirteen dollars for this". [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, for a sandwich.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, I thought it was funny.  In the seventies it was pretty cute. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, [MN] seventies it's way expensive, like --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah --
L:  -- you know.
R:  -- thirteen dollars for a sand- I was like, scratching my head, 'cause [SIGH] at that time a hoagie was l- I mean, or s- a cheese steak was about two or three dollars, it wasn't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, [SIGH] [MN] and here they're talking -- and I'm thinking, "Okay, maybe I'm in a fancy restaurant, I don't know". [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, that'll teach you, you got to know what you're asking for.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  You're not in Philly anymore.
R:  Yeah, [SIGH] I learned that in one of the hard ways.  That's why you have say, "Philly cheese steak".  It's a chip steak.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  they -- they actually know that down here.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And that -- well, that's because there's a lot of transplants [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- from here to there.
L:  There's not too many people I've met -- I've lived here almost seven years, there's not too many people I've met that are actually native.  Almost everybody here [SIGH] that I've met --
R:  Yeah, they're n- there's not --
L:  -- so far are from somewhere else.
R:  -- a [MN] lot of natural Floridians.
L:  yeah, only -- well, only my students --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and their families, but, like, friends that I've made down here --
R:  Right.
L:  -- turns out most of them are from New York or the northeast.
R:  Absolutely, yeah.
L:  New York, New Jersey, a lot of the teachers that I work with.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, a lot of the -- a lot of the time, [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] especially down the shore areas of Atlantic City, Wildwood, Cape May, [SIGH] um, they actually have two homes.  For the winter they stay in Florida [LIPSMACK] and for the summer they come back to open up their businesses.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] So they can stay in warm weather --
L:  We call 'em snowbirds.
R:  -- because usually after [SIGH] the summer [SIGH] the [LIPSMACK] uh, resort town, I mean, short of Atlantic city, the resort towns just sh- cl- fold up.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Close down, so, [SIGH] they, you know, go down to Florida for -- that's their vacation time, they go to Florida for the winter --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] which is kinda nice.
L:  Yeah, they -- we call 'em snowbirds.
R:  I've never been to Florida yet.
L:  You've not --
R:  My boyfriend was going to take me down this time, but [SIGH] he took me to Canada to meet his parents.  We've been on and off for, like, two years, [SIGH] but he -- he took me to Canada to meet his parents and his father got really wigged out when I wanted to use his computer. [LAUGH] It was like, "My computer". [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [SIGH] So I was, you know, [SIGH] thinking, "I don't want a -- a repeat of this, so go ahead, have a good time". [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  "See you when you come back". [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That kind of thing. [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] But it's funny, because in Philadelphia, like, for the native Philadelphians, [SIGH] there's a street called Gerard Street [SIGH] --
L:  Don't know it.
R:  [SIGH] [MN] 
L:  I've been to Philly before.
R:  Yeah, it's a pretty big street, and -- any -- and it's actually, like, an elevator stop -- a train stop too.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [MN] And [SIGH] native Philadelphians will say Gerard.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They will not say Gerard.  If anybody says Gerard, we know they're not natural. [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh, okay.
R:  [SIGH] Because we all say Gerard, you know, what I mean? Say, "Oh, yeah, it's Gerard Street" you know, that kind of thing [SIGH] and it -- it is truly Gerard, but it's kinda cute, 'cause then you can tell if they were born there or not, you know.
L:  Yeah.
