L:  [SIGH] Hi.
R:  Claudia.
L:  [MN] Hi, how are you?
R:  Oh, hi. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] These are kind of strange calls.
R:  Aren't they?
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] 
R:  My name's Claudia.
L:  I'm Molly.
R:  Hi, Molly, how are you doing?
L:  [MN] I'm good, how are you?
R:  I'm good, thank you.
L:  Good.
R:  Good.
L:  Um, [SIGH] I g- I go to the gym three days a week [SIGH] and that's really about all I do. [LAUGH] 
R:  God bless you.  I don't go at all. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Oh, gosh.
R:  Uh --
L:  [SIGH] Well, that's fine too, I mean, I --
R:  Yeah, well, no, not really.  I used to -- used to go [MN] just a few days a week, um, mainly lifting weights and, what, the treadmill.
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH] But, uh, I quit --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and, uh --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- kind of regret it now, but I am going to be joining a health club probably --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- in the next couple of weeks.  I'm waiting for a bill or -- so I can have proof of -- of where I live to get registered at this new place, so 
L:  [NOISE] Right, right.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] Well, um, [SIGH] I don't know what we're supposed to --
R:  Um [LAUGH] --
L:  -- [SIGH] do in this thing. [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm not sure.  What type of exercise do you do?
L:  [SIGH] Um, actually --
R:  [COUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  -- I do a lot of treadmill work --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] and I do a lot of toning work because I am [SIGH] going to be forty seven very soon --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like in the next month and a half --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [SIGH] and um, uh, gravity has taken its effect.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It starts early.
L:  [SIGH] And so that's -- that's why I do what I do --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is just to [SIGH] maintain, [SIGH] you know, a decent shape or whatever, I mean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I work [SIGH] in a, um, [SIGH] country club. [SIGH] I work at a country club with a lot of young people --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] and, [MN] so, uh, you know, I'm very vain, I guess --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- obviously. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] And very honest, and that's cool.
L:  Yes. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, well, gee.
L:  [SIGH] So --
R:  Um, I guess the --
L:  -- that's why I do what I do. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, that's -- it's a good idea.  I mean, you got to stay active anyways just to --
L:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.
R:  -- maintain some level of -- of --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- physicality so you don't just end up a blob.  I mean, that's too easy to do.
L:  Exactly.
R:  But, um --
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  So you probably --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- get exercise just at work too, keeping up with the young kids, right?
L:  Uh, well, [SIGH] it's --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- a little bit, but, you know, your body gets used to it.
R:  Yeah, yeah, it does and you get -- you -- you need to push yourself a little bit more, I guess sometimes.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Exactly.
R:  You're from the south, I'm gathering.
L:  [SIGH] Yes. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm from South Carolina.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Well, actually, I'm from Ohio.
R:  Oh, okay, really?  I was going to say Tennessee, but --
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] 
R:  -- your -- your accent sounds -- I have friends in Knoxville, Tennessee.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.
R:  And -- and your accent sounds like just --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- exactly like them.
L:  [SIGH] Yours sounds -- let's see.  I don't know, I've got a friend that's in Virginia --
R:  Mm mm.
L:  -- that sounds like you.
R:  Really?  Yeah.
L:  I mean, she doesn't really have a --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- southern --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- drawl --
R:  [MN] I'm -- I'm in Chicago.
L:  Okay.
R:  B- born and raised. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, cool, okay.
R:  But, um, yeah, if there's any southern in my voice it's probably from my boyfriend who's from, uh, Tampa Bay, Florida, and from, uh, most recently, Georgia in Al-
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- in Atlanta.  So, everyone says I'm starting to pick up his twang.
L:  Uh. [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't know about that, but -- he doesn't exercise either, by the way. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well I -- my husband, I mean, I'm on him all the time, and he goes, "Would you just leave me alone" 'cause he doesn't --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- do -- [SIGH] he works outside.  He's --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- [MN] very physical [SIGH] working outside.  He works at another golf club [SIGH] --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and, um -- so he works outside and he goes -- when he gets home it's like, "Come on, let's go to the gym" and he goes, "No".
R:  All right. No, after that you just got --
L:  "Leave me alone". 
R:  -- to sit down.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] And I totally understand that.
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  Believe me, I do.
R:  Sure.
L:  [SIGH] So --
R:  You're working --
L:  -- um, you're from around Tampa area, or you've lived there before?
R:  No, my boyfriend did. 
L:  Mm.
R:  He lived in Tampa for about seven -- I think it was about seven years --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- oh, no, excuse me, about eleven.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Eleven years.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah, I'm in Chicago.
L:  Okay.
R:  I've been here all my life.
L:  [SIGH] I've only been to Chicago one time and that was going through the airport and that was --
R:  Oh, well that's no fun.
L:  -- god, that was sh-
R:  It's a good airport, but  [LAUGH] 
L:  I know.  Well, that was so many years ago [MN] and actually it was when I was living in Ohio.
R:  Mm.
L:  [SIGH] I was going to L.A., um, with my dad, when I was, like, thirteen. [SIGH] 
R:  Oh, boy.
L:  So, we won't talk --
R:  That's a while, yeah.
L:  -- about how many years ago that was. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  Oh, it's okay.  You should come, it's a great place.
L:  I've heard.
R:   A lot of fun.  I don't go down town very often 'cause that's just too much for me, but -- great restaurants and theater and everything.
L:  Oh.
R:  The lakeside is gorgeous and --
L:  That's neat.  That is --
R:  Yeah, it's a nice --
L:  -- neat.
R:  -- place. 
L:  [SIGH] So, are we supposed to talk about fitness [MN] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the whole time?
R:  I suppose we are.  I'm not --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I'm not sure, I've never --
L:  [SIGH] Well, let's see.
R:  -- never actually finished a call. 
L:  [SIGH] I don't know what else to say.  I mean, you know [SIGH] --
R:  Right, either you do or you don't and --
L:  Yeah, [SIGH] and --
R:  -- and I guess that's it kind of it.
L:  -- you know, um, [LIPSMACK] [MN] [SIGH] I try to do the good food thing, but I don't.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I mean, I figure since I work out I can go ahead --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and eat what I want, 'cause my --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- weight -- [SIGH] my weight maintains, you know, it stays the same thing. [SIGH] 
R:  Well, as long as you're burning it off and not trying to lose, like, [MN] [SIGH] eat what the hell you want, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I would --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- I would kill to have a bag of chips right now, but I just started the Atkins program --
L:  Oh, jeeze.
R:  -- um, about f- four days ago.
L:  That thing is supposed to work awesome.
R:  [NOISE] It's supposed to, we'll see --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I -- I could certainly --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- lose a few pounds. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, I'll tell you, um, I've talked to several people [SIGH] that [MN] are doing it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] and, um, my problem would be the potatoes and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the bread and the ri- you know, all that kind of good --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- stuff. [SIGH] Um, but they have done it, and they've done it faithfully and they have lost mega weight --
R:  Really?
L:  -- on that.
R:  Good.
L:  [SIGH] Um, they just had the willpower and they say, like, after the third week of [SIGH] [MN] being on that, you don't have the desire for the bread --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and the --
R:  Right.
L:  -- potatoes and --
R:  Right, your cravings --
L:  -- stuff like that.
R:  -- are gone for it when the --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the less you have, the less you want it.
L:  [SIGH] And so --
R:  I'm doing pretty good, I mean, I'm -- I'm pretty much -- I love my pasta --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or potatoes, any kind of potatoes, mashed potatoes, French fries, potato chips, [LAUGH] I don't care.
L:  Oh, I know. [LAUGH] 
R:  Big potato hash browns, everything.  I mean, I love potatoes, that's what I eat, but --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I've been doing okay --
L:  [SIGH] Well, you know --
R:  -- for four days without it, I'm surprised.
L:  [SIGH] I don't know if you even thought about this, and I'm -- [MN] you might have -- 
R:  Mhm.  
L:  -- but you know, you can eat -- [SIGH] and this is a southern thing, okay, but they --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- really taste good, pork rinds.
R:  Oh, I love those.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, good, you can eat those.
R:  Mhm, I use them in recipes --
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  -- pretty much, um, I try not to snack on 'em too much because then that makes me want a bag of potato chips or, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- cheetos or something or burritos, so -- [SIGH] but, um, uh, yeah, I use them in baking a lot instead of breadcrumbs, so I use that.
L:  Oh, gosh.
R:  But they're lower, yeah.
L:  Well, I love those things, and those are my downfall, and --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know, it's really big.  I mean, I think they are worse probably for you than potato chips and that.
R:  Oh, I don't know, I don't know.
L:  Well, you never know.
R:  They're -- they're -- least they're low in the carbos.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Um, but [MN] they actually have a microwave bag of 'em.  I think it's by Lauries.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, really?
R:  If you have a Wal-Mart by you?
L:  Oh, [LAUGH] yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  They sell 'em there.  No, they're actually pretty good. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] And you can eat 'em right out of the bag, they're nice and hot [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, gosh.
R:  -- and they're still popping and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- yeah, they're good.  You can -- you should look for those.
L:  I don't know if you should have told me that. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Well, you'll just have to go work out a little longer, that's all.
L:  But I don't wan to do that. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] I really don't --
R:  I've never actually -- I'm sorry --
L:  Oh, go ahead, go ahead.
R:  Oh, I was just saying, I never actually finished a phone call on here.  How long are we supposed to be on for, do you know?
L:  Ten minutes.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LIPSMACK] But you sound --
R:  And then they cut --
L:  -- oh, gosh, you got -- you know, you got a great voice and a great personality, it's like [SIGH] --
R:  Oh, thank you.
L:  -- "Jeeze, this is somebody I could bond with". 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know. [SIGH] 
R:  Well, thanks.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, gosh, it's the --
R:  Well, I'm assuming you're --
L:  -- again, no, I haven't --
R:  -- you're online --
L:  -- lasted too long either.
R:  -- obviously, right?
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  I'm sorry, what was that?
L:  I said I haven't lasted too long either on these calls, it's like --
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, no. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you get somebody on there and they're going, "Uh-huh"
R:  "Uh-huh".
L:  "Uh-huh". [LAUGH] 
R:  "Okay".
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  "Well". 
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  No, I -- I can't -- that's -- yeah, I -- I -- that's not right. [LAUGH] I mean, you got to at least try to talk --
L:  Oh, I know it.
R:  -- to each other, so 
L:  I know it. [SIGH] it is strange --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for me, though, to be able to talk to a total stranger, because, you know, if I ever meet you on the s- on the street, I wouldn't be able to talk to you this way, I just --
R:  Oh, sure, sure.
L:  -- not a real --
R:  Well --
L:  -- I mean, on the --
R:  -- yeah, there'd be no reason to. [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN] Yeah, but I'm saying I'm not a real outgoing person --
R:  No.
L:  -- [SIGH] and even if we met face to face in a seminar or something like that [SIGH] I would probably [SIGH] freeze up and go, "Oh" you know, just shut up.
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  You know, don't say anything.
R:  I -- I'm -- I'm pretty much the same way unless I'm forced to or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, in -- in a situation like this --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's either just sit here and -- and [MN] what's -- you know, what fun is that, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] I figure I --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- you know, may as well at least open up my big mouth and [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- just let it come out. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, exactly, [SIGH] 'cause we do have them. [LAUGH] 
R:  That's right, that's right.
L:  [SIGH] Well, um, so, what do you do, like, for hobbies and whatever?
R:  Um, travel is my big thing.  I love to travel.
L:  Oh, that's neat.
R:  So, yeah, um, I was recently laid off from my job in January.
L:  Oh, gosh.
R:  [SIGH] Which is actually okay, it was a good thing.  I was there for fourteen years, though, so it was kind of a shock --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and a little bit of an adjustment, but, god, I love it. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right, I'm sure.
R:  [SIGH] I figured, you know what?  I'll just stay home, at least until the summer is over.  I'll stay with my kids.
L:  Wow.  Oh --
R:  [LIPSMACK] And just spend time hanging around. [SIGH] And it worked out to be really good because we just recently moved --
L:  Oh, neat.
R:  -- so had I not been off of work anyways, I would have had to taken off work to pack and unpack and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- see it and clean and all that.
L:  [SIGH] Well --
R:  [inaudible]
