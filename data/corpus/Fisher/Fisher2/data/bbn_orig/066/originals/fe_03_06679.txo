R:  I -- I don't --
L:  [NOISE] hard for pretty much ev- [NOISE] well, [SIGH] I don't know, sometimes it's hard [NOISE] because you have to be really dedicated and stuff [NOISE] to doing that [NOISE] and it's --

R:  [MN] 
L:  -- people say I -- I look good --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [MN] like, with some of the clothes I wear, but I'm, like -- [NOISE] for me I'm not happy happy.  Like, when I was --
R:  Oh. [SIGH] 
L:  -- one oh five [NOISE] I was real happy [NOISE] [SIGH] --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- but I didn't wear real revealing clothes [NOISE] but I wore [SIGH] [NOISE] clothes -- like, they just fit [NOISE] and they fell in all the right places [NOISE] and now I feel, like, ugh.
R:  Well, I fell like they make --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- clothes so small in the waist now.
L:  [SIGH] Y- yeah, they do, [NOISE] like, [SIGH] you see a shirt [NOISE] that says large but it looks, like, [NOISE] super small, [NOISE] [SIGH] or --
R:  Yes, I --
L:  -- or like, [NOISE] [MN] you know, so it's [NOISE] -- that's --
R:  [SIGH] Well --
L:  -- like, it's hard to shop for my mum too, like, [MN] [SIGH] birthdays or whatever [NOISE] just o buy her something.
R:  Well, that's me, if I buy any -- any pants I have to hike 'em up in the hips --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- I have to buy a size --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- larger because of my waist --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and then I have to take 'em up in --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- in the hips and they --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- don't look correctly. [SIGH] I hate --
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
R:  -- to buy clothes. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, yeah, it -- it -- I can get frustrated too when I'm buying clothes, [SIGH] like, sometimes I can't find, [SIGH] like [NOISE] -- like, when I have money --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- like, [NOISE] I can't find anything I want, but when I don't have money I find everything I want and it gets frustrating. [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, yes, oh, yes, we all do that. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, it's frustrating --
R:  Oh, [SIGH] oh.
L:  -- [NOISE] sometimes I just end up buying stuff [SIGH] that [NOISE] I don't want or I don't wear and I end up giving it away.
R:  Oh, well, I --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I'm very bad at that too --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I have --
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  -- stuff in my closet that I have never worn but I [SIGH] I've --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, it's brand new and I -- I never have worn it and it's --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, it's just hanging there. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Waiting for a certain occasion I guess, you know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  --to -- [SIGH] to be --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- to be able to fit into it or -- or whatever, [SIGH] um --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  -- so, uh, you don't, um -- you have an exercise machine at home that you ride --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- or something?
L:  Um, no, no, I just mainly go for power walks and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [SIGH] or jogging [NOISE] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- or just for walks, or, like, I do sit ups, but no, [NOISE] I don't know, e- exercising machines --
R:  Uh, [SIGH] we --
L:  -- in San Diego I did, we used to go to the gym, or, like, my aunt had, like, in her, um -- like, this one workout room --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- [SIGH] all, like, these different kinds of things, so [NOISE] --
R:  Oh, that sounds neat, uh, we have a --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] treadmill and a -- a bike --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- a -- one of these --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- bikes that has the handles that move [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah, that's cool --
R:  -- um --
L:  -- that's not [SIGH] the bike that -- oh, the handles move.  Is that one of those ones, like, it's, like, the cardio machine or whatever?
R:  Right, yeah --
L:  Or is it a bike?
R:  -- you -- you can peddle --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it or you can either move -- like, move the handle bars or --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- not move them, whichever you want to do --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] and I like that because it --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- works your arms --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  -- and it works your legs --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- at the same time, um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- but, um, in summer times it's -- it --
L:  [NOISE]

R:  -- in good health, uh-huh.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] Do you like to eat?  My --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- my trouble is I like --

R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [NOISE] for, like, chocolate. [SIGH] 
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
L:  Like -- yeah, like, I'll have, like, a [NOISE] -- maybe like a Snicker [NOISE] with a glass or milk or something [NOISE] [SIGH] just --
R:  Well, the milk is good for you --
L:  -- little things that --
R:  Well, the milk is good for you. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] [MN] Yeah, yeah.
R:  [SIGH] And -- and you got to treat yourself once in a while --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- if you don't then when you do eat --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you go overboard, right?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Or -- or I do. [SIGH] Um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I love --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- apples and I -- my --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- weakness --
L:  [NOISE] [MN] 
R:  -- weakness is apples and peanut butter --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- have you ever tried that?
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  Uh-huh, actually I haven't.
R:  Uh, um --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- crunchy peanut butter --
L:  [NOISE] [MN] 
R:  -- on a slice of --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- cold apple, that is so good. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Oh, that sounds, good, though. [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] Yes, it does, uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE] No, we have -- we have, um [NOISE] -- let's see, right now we have [NOISE] [SIGH] m- mangoes and, um --
R:  Oh, all right.
L:  -- those are good and, um, pears, [SIGH] cherries and strawberries. [NOISE] So --
R:  Uh, in your -- you pick them fresh --

R:  -- or you get them form the market?
L:  [NOISE] Oh, from the store.
R:  From the store?
L:  From the market.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But actually we have, like, a little strawberry patch, [NOISE] [SIGH] like, my brother has a little -- a -- a strawberry patch, so, like --
R:  Oh, right.
L:  -- [SIGH] sometimes the strawberries grow and [NOISE] we just pick them from the little patch. [NOISE] 
R:  Uh-huh, we -- I have a small patch --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and the weather's been so bad on them --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- uh, it's been too much rain here.
L:  Oh, uh-huh.
R:  So we don't get, uh, any luck.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I guess strawberries are good for you --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- any kind of berry --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- is good for you.
L:  Uh-huh. [NOISE] [SIGH] I --

R:  -- I -- I love, um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- fried fish and fried chicken. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah, that's good too.
R:  [SIGH] I guess you should boil it --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- for it to be healthy --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- am I correct?
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
R:  Or bake it. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] But my husband doesn't like baked fish --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- or -- or boiled fish.  He loves --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it fried.
L:  [NOISE] Mm.
R:  Of course, we -- we're southern people --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and southern people love anything --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- fried.

R:  So, uh --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- well, anyway, uh --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um, I guess we're supposed to talk about health and fitness --
