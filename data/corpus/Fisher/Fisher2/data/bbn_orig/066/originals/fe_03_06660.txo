L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  My name's Elenora.
R:  Hi.  How are you today, Elenora?
L:  Oh, I'm fine, how are you?
R:  Good.  Are you just -- are you a participant that, uh, called in or are you ...?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, okay.  Um, I guess I'm supposed to ask some questions about you and then we're supposed to discuss health and fitness.  What do you do for exercise?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, do -- do you want to talk or do you want to me talk or what?
L:  [NOISE] Go ahead.  What's your name?
R:  Richard.
L:  Go ahead, Richard.
R:  Um, you sound like a southerner.
L:  I'm a Californian.
R:  Oh, okay.  Cal- -- you're Californian.  Well, anyhow, uh, what I do for health and fitness is I swim daily and I, uh, walk a coupla miles, uh, a day and I try to, um, do other things that are either walking or, um, using arms and hands and so forth. [NOISE] In the summertime I garden and, uh, use a spade, pull weeds --
L:  Oh, that sounds great.
R:  How about yourself?
L:  Well, last week I went to the, um, gym across the street from where I live and, um --
R:  Oh, where -- whereabouts do you live?
L:  I live in Long Beach.
R:  Oh, my goodness, huh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Boy, you're a long ways away.  I live in Michigan.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Oh.
L:  I have some relatives there.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.  I, um -- I haven't been doing any exercises.  I just, um --
R:  You -- you -- you go -- go to a fitness gym, though, is that right?
L:  Yeah, I went to one last week, last Tuesday I think it was, and I worked out on the treadmill --
R:  Oh, that's really good, yeah.
L:  And I, um -- and I worked out on this other machine that was, um -- it was like a treadmill but your legs don't stop moving.  It's, uh -- it rows your feet around.  It -- I don't know what that thing was called.  It just keeps your legs rolling round and round and round, your feet, you know.  You just balance your feet on it and it just goes in a rowing motion, like you're rowing a boat.
R:  Does it have pedals?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Not like a bicycle --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, uh, long like skis.
R:  Huh, I'm --
L:  Long like skis.
R:  -- not familiar with that.
L:  Yeah, I had never seen one before.
R:  Oh, well I'll be darned.  That's -- that's different.
L:  Mhm.  So I worked out on that.
R:  Uh, where I go --
L:  Hm?
R:  Uh --
L:  I --
R:  -- where I go swimming at the Y they have the treadmill and several other ty- -- uh, types, most of them are like bicycle, uh, type, uh, fitness machines but the one you're talking about, I'm not familiar with at all, so ...
L:  [NOISE] It was fun.
R:  Huh.
L:  I had a great time.
R:  Well, great --
L:  I couldn't -- I -- I didn't want to stop.
R:  Huh.
L:  Yeah, it just -- it just made me, like, kept going and going and going.  The only thing -- only thing that -- that, uh, [SIGH] made me stay on it was that it was so simple to be automated.  Like, you know, it was no effort on my part at all [NOISE] but, of course, the next couple of days I paid for it. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I'll be darned.
L:  I was so sore.
R:  Huh.  You know, I used to live in Long Beach [LAUGH].
L:  Really!
R:  That was a long, long time ago though.  I was just a little fella, a little youngster, ya.
L:  Did you ever go swimming at the -- all the beaches?
R:  I'm sure I -- I'm sure we did but I -- you know, it's been so long ago I don't remember too much except my mother must have been real fit because there's a hill somewhere in Long Beach and she was driving down it and the brakes went on the car and --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  And I didn't realize, I was too young to know and it just -- she just, you know -- just zipped down there.  I guess she finally, um -- she drove the car until, you know, it stopped --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then, um, you know, she was able to stop the car.  I thought it was fun but it was -- she was probably terrified, so --
L:  I know she was.  I'm getting my brakes worked on tomorrow.
R:  Huh.
L:  I went by the place yesterday but they had to order the parts so they ordered me some, um, rotors for my front tires and um --
R:  Oh, okay, yeah, that's what they usually do.
L:  -- those are going to cost me a pretty penny, forty nine dollars a piece.
R:  Oh, for a rotor?
L:  He said he could do the whole job -- for some rotors, yeah.
R:  Oh, that doesn't sound like -- that doesn't sound bad at all.
L:  Really?
R:  No.
L:  It's a four cylinder.  It's a, um --
R:  You have a small car?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, you know, do you do -- do you do -- do you walk at all at Long Beach or ...?
L:  Yeah, mhm.
R:  Yeah, the weather's real nice there, I'm su- -- sure most of the year.  Yeah.  Are you near the beach, then?
L:  I live near the beach, yeah --
R:  Oh, huh.
L:  -- but I work in LA.
R:  Oh, you sp- --
L:  I work all the way in Los Angeles.
R:  Wow, you -- you spend a lot of time on the road, I'd imagine.
L:  Oh, yes.  At least a hour each way.
R:  Wow, wow.
L:  And don't let the traffic be backed up.  It is stre- -- you get stressed out.  But I -- I -- the -- the ride is boring, you know, it's a boring ride watching the traffic and stuff.  You know, I could, um -- but I get my exercise in my feet, though. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  With that pedal.
R:  I see, huh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I do -- I do quite a bit of walking.  I live in a rural area and, uh, I --
L:  Oh, you do?
R:  Yeah, I walk --
L:  Out in the country?
R:  Way out in the country.
L:  Oh, I bet you see the birds and the squirrels and the rabbits.
R:  Yes, I do. [LAUGH] Unfortunately --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- there's another one that I see, uh, right this time of year is the mosquitoes and they're ferocious right now.
L:  Ooh!
R:  So ...
L:  That's the only thing I don't like about the country is them dang mosquitoes.  You got to get the, uh, propellant, that Off. [NOISE]
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  That Easy Off spray.
R:  I --
L:  You can't outrun 'em either --
R:  Well --
L:  -- 'cause they know you're going stop.
R:  It's funny, though, when I'm walking, I complain about the wind here.  It's so bad, you know, it just seems like it's continuous but when the wind is really blowing, um, they don't bite you so, uh --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, they're -- they're --
L:  Oh, yeah, 'cause they're light and they can't hang on.
R:  No, no, they're --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  If the wind is really blowing they just don't come out, so ...
L:  But you know Avon has some, uh, stuff that is good for repelling mosquitoes.
R:  Oh, yeah --
L:  Have you heard about it?
R:  Yes, yes.  I use the repellent but, in fact, I've got some of that.  Probably a lot healthier for you.  I think I have some.
L:  Yeah, my --
R:  I had some at one time, I don't know if I still got it or not.  It works a lot better than the repellent, even.
L:  It does.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's supposed to be some kind of body stuff, some kind of body --
R:  Yeah, what it is, I think, is they -- they -- when you put that on they don't think you're a human or you don't think you're prey so they're con- -- they're -- I've used it before and it really works a lot better than the -- than the, uh, mosquito repellent.  But you do have to put it on you, it's real perfumey.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  So ... I think I got some somewhere [several inaudible words].
L:  At least you'll be smelling good. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, yes [LAUGH].  You can go right up town.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know what I did with it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but that -- it's Avon body lotion, I think it is.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Perhaps I don't have any more.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it works, uh -- it works really good.  I should work -- I should use that when I'm taking my walks.
L:  So, do -- when you exercise, do you sweat?  Are you just -- just walking?
R:  Um, most of the time I --
L:  Or --
R:  I don't 'cause like, if I'm swimming, you know, you don't, in that you're -- you're usually fairly cool, and then just walking you don't, not --
L:  Mhm.
R:  This is fairly cool here, it's the northern part of Michigan so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's not, uh, that warm.
L:  Is that where the college is, Michigan State?
R:  Well, the -- the Michigan State is here but that's in quite a ways away, it's in the southern part of the state, so ...
L:  'Cause I went by there on the train.
R:  Huh.
L:  I was there in ninety five, nineteen ninety five.
R:  Oh, you went by in a train.
L:  My mother had her eighty fifth birthday at her sister's house there in Detroit.
R:  Oh, okay, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I -- I've never been in the train in Michigan.  I -- I don't know, uh --
L:  Amtrak.
R:  -- much about it.
L:  Amtrak train.
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I -- I haven't been that far south in Michigan in a long time so ...
L:  Yeah, it was a beautiful campus.  It came right out to the -- to the train station.  The train just went right in front of it.
R:  Were you --
L:  All the students were there [NOISE] and they have the big -- big -- big gate.
