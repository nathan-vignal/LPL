R:  Hi I'm Kim.
L:  I'm Christy.
R:  Hi. 
L:  Hello, um, I've never really, um, been in private schools but I've been in public schools.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, home schooling and I don't personally think that you know they should carry the right to say what a child can and can't read.
R:  This is definitely something I take a great interest in seeing as I'm -- I'm a writer.  I go to North Western I'm a journalism major -- oh I'm apologizing in advance I got my tongue pierced yesterday, um, but, um, I definitely write some very -- I'm in the process of writing a book and it's very -- the -- the information inside is -- would -- would definitely be something that would be looked at and questioned um --
L:  Right and censored.  [LAUGH]
R:  Definitely and I -- I don't think it deserves to be censored I think everyone has a right to know so we're definitely in agreement.
L:  Yeah that's -- that going back to what is it the first movement the freedom of speech?
R:  Mhm.  It's a --
L:  First amendment.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I mean that goes back to that you know every particular person individual has the right to say what they want.
R:  But you said you were home schooled?
L:  Yeah I was, uh, home schooled in -- in doing that, um, my mum censored stuff that I read and that you know I was allowed to be exposed to.
R:  Had she -- had she selected -- what was her reason behind selecting home schooling? 
L:  Um, some of it was for the fact, um, she wanted me to have a better education, she didn't want me in all of the peer pressure.  She didn't want me to be kind of exposed to things that I shouldn't be exposed to at certain ages and that goes back to the issue that we're talking about.
R:  Exactly so I was going to say do -- do you feel that, um, by her somewhat censoring your education -- education you -- you benefited or how you feel that -- that effected you and your life and -- and your later selections like did -- did you end up, um, when you discovered things on your own did it um -- were you -- were you more [inaudible] to -- to like you know used on or whatever.
L:  Um, well there were some things that I'm glad that she didn't let me you know get exposed to you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that the public schools, um, I'm not sure the public schools but the outside world has exposure --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to at such a young age because of you know different influences in my life could of gone the wrong way.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But in the same aspect there was lot of things that I wasn't allowed to -- you know be privileged to.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  Um, I wasn't allowed to you know read any kind of war history you know stuff because that was too graphic, too gross and -- or any kind of major science fiction stuff because you know that's not real stuff you don't need to put fake stuff in your mind you don't need to, um, basically have your own halluc[?] of imagination if you want per se put it that way.
R:  That's interesting cause I feel like especially in terms of science do you -- do you still agree with that today?
L:  Oh, no because I enjoy -- I mean some of my favorite shows on TV are a lot of science fiction you know as a series.
R:  Cause in terms of science fiction I don't know if you are familiar with Donna Harroway? 
L:  Um, not off hand.
R:  She's a feminist author who claims that cyborgs [inaudible] science fiction creation, um, are -- are actually a teaching in a -- in a way to escape the feminist balance because cyborgs are -- are a combination of both, um, you know like they're -- they're super human you know like --
L:  Right.  
R:  -- like they -- they escape the gender bounds and she thinks it's the best way to people about how to escape the -- you know gender markings.  So I think that's like really interesting that your mum would choose that of all things.
L:  Yeah that's -- that's what I mean the selection was, what was she was approved of with you know with what she grew up and thought what I needed to be taught or not taught or not exposed to.
R:  And how -- how old were you like how long did you per take in -- in schooling -- home schooling.
L:  Through my senior year.
R:  Oh, really so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's interesting I think what's also interesting about, um, censorship is some of the books that are censored include, um, the Grimm's Fairy Tales.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like do you find that at all amusing like it's like Cinderella is a Grimm's Fairytale imagine not having read that.
L:  It gets -- kind of boggles my mind sometimes as to what they do censor and what they don't --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- and it's like how did that fly through there you know why wasn't that you know put a little higher rating on there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's like you know what they choose to censor is just -- it depends on who's doing it.
R:  Right well I think a lot of it extends into religion and -- and violence a lot of it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, like to -- to extent into religion first of all again violates the constitution separation of church and states but further, um, it violates -- another thing that was censored is [inaudible] you know of mice and men.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, until they -- they choose to -- to further -- it's your choice on what you read it's also the same choice on what you watch on television.
L:  Right.
R:  So until they -- they further censor what you can watch on T V I think they're going to have to do a lot better job but -- but a lot better job with TV before they can select what they want to do on TV or in -- in reading.
L:  Right I mean if you restrict people from reading what they want you also restrict them from the possibility of them exploring their own options, their own mind, their own opinion.  They're own creative ability cause if somebody might of restricted you, you might not be writing now.
R:  That's true.  Do you think, um, -- what was I going to say, um.  Do you think people actually mimic what they read and that there could be something right in censorship? 
L:  Um, I think they do to a degree but that's all part of one taking responsibility in your own actions.
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  Because everybody has to be responsible for their actions.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  And if they choose not to be responsible for their actions how can you honestly hold the author accountable for what they write?  Just for the fact that everybody is accountable for their own actions.
R:  Cause I mean I -- I -- like the more I think about it it's just like this is my second conversation I've done and they always give questions that we seem to agree on.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  So I played devil's advocate here I -- I think we give or I'm giving way too much benefit of the doubt to the human population I go to North Western I'm around very educated people um --
L:  They can be so stupid sometimes can't they?  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, they -- yeah you know in a -- in a different way they're very -- they're very closed minded but on the other hand to play devil's advocate cause I'm always around those people I'm not -- I'm not familiar with people who don't -- who can't separate between like I guess right and wrong or reality and fiction so I mean perhaps it -- there is some -- there is some sensibility in restricting in people's readings like I guess in terms of not reading but even movies do you remember that movie The Players several years ago? 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Where they have the scene of people playing under cars.
L:  Right and they went out and did it.
R:  What's that?
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  That -- exactly so like maybe to play devil's advocate people -- I'm giving people way too much benefit and -- and, um, maybe they -- they need to be restricted both need to be restricted.
L:  I -- I think that's -- I think they need to do like they do on TV put labels on them M for mature, or PG thirteen this way the parents when they see them they know that hey look this is a little bit too old rating for my child.
R:  That's an interesting perspective.  [inaudible]
L:  I mean cause they're doing that on TV and you know then it's not the -- you know the TV's responsibility it's now the parent and the child responsibilities as to what the child is watching.
R:  That's very interesting perspective, I kind of agree with that I think that's a good idea.
L:  I mean if they want to censor the book find a program that works.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean they do it with the toys, age appropriate toys.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  [inaudible]
R:  And do you have children of your own -- I don't know how old you are.
L:  Um, I have one on the way.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really?
L:  And, um, a seven year old.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so we do, we don't let her you know read stuff that is going to give her nightmares or stuff that is a little too evolved for her that she doesn't understand but we censor what she -- we censor to the fact of not what she can't read.
R:  Um, so do you let her read -- does she read Grimm's Fairy Tales -- like Hansel and Gretel is the most, um, the -- the censored Fairytales.
L:  Um, I don't know if -- actually if I've ever read that one to her.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Hansel and Gretel.
R:  I think, uh, Little Red Riding Hood was another one.
L:  Yeah I know we have read her that one but it's -- you know we don't put it as you know she's a bad girl or the wolf's a bad guy you know the wolf's just you know
