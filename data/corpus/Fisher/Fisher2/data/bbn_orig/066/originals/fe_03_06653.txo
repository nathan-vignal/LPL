R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, this is Jackie.
L:  Hi, this is Linda.
R:  Hi.  Have you ever done this before?
L:  No.  [LAUGH].
R:  No, I haven't either.  This is my first call.
L:  Me, too.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  Yeah, I was a little nervous, but I don't know, I guess we're supposed to talk about health and fitness?
L:  Ah.
R:  Um, do you work --
L:  Do you --
R:  -- out or anything?
L:  No.  [LAUGH].
R:  No, I don't either.  I had a baby, um, five months ago.
L:  Oh.
R:  And, um, I still kinda look like I'm pregnant, so I've -- I -- I -- I teach school and um, yesterday was my last day at school, so I got up this morning really, really early and I walked a mile, but I'm already so tired, I couldn't done this, I wouldn't reckon, for the rest of the day.
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH].
R:  So [LAUGH] --
L:  That's a lot of hard work, though, for a baby.
R:  Yeah, but --
L:  To have a baby around.
R:  -- I have a three year old also.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, um, but yeah, I've got to lose some weight 'cause I can't fit in any of my clothes.
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH].
R:  So, I would like to lose a little bit at least.
L:  Mm.  Well, I basically work on the computer all day, so I'm, I guess uh, a chair potato.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, and that's hard because, you know, I know, like, I can sit -- spend tons of time just in front of the computer and waste tons of time.
L:  Mm.  
R:  [MN] and before I know it, I've been on there for, like, an hour and a half or two hours.
L:  That long?  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Well, I do it all day.  Um, it's my work, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, and I work out of the house, so I should find time to do exercise, even sitting down I could do some.
R:  Uh-huh.  Do you have children?
L:  Yes.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  They're all grown and on their own now.
R:  Oh, are they?
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, gosh, you're so lucky.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  No, I miss it.  
R:  Yeah, I guess someday I'll miss it, but --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- right now, I don't know if I miss it.  [LAUGH].
L:  Well, that's when you get your most exercise, is when your children are at home and you're --
R:  I guess --
L:  -- chasing them.
R:  I guess so.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  Have you worked at home for a long time?
L:  I started a year ago.
R:  Did you?
L:  Before that, I was in banking.
R:  Yeah.  I um, I just -- I'm not going to teach next year.  I'm taking a year off.
L:  Oh.
R:  To stay at home with my two girls.
L:  Well, that's great.
R:  So, yeah, I'm -- that's why I got to lose a little bit of weight.  I shouldn't have any excuses now.
L:  Mm.
R:  For not exercise -- but -- but it's hard to get a lot of motivation to do it.
L:  It is.  Very hard.  [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.  How did you hear about this program?
L:  A friend of mine.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You?
R:  Oh, through a website.
L:  Oh.
R:  A website, and so I thought, well you know?
L:  Yeah.  A friend of mine on the web -- on my website told me about it.
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  Mm.
R:  Yeah.  I thought, well, that might be an easy way to make a little bit of money.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  So I thought I would try it and see.
L:  Mm.  Do you know if they monitor us or what they do?
R:  I have no idea.  I know -- I -- it just said, you know, that they'll tell us when ten minutes was up, but --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I don't really know.
L:  Okay.  
R:  I don't really know what -- ah, what they're doing, actually.
L:  So have you thought of getting exercise videos or --
R:  Yeah, I have a lot of videos, but --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I have no motivation.
L:  Ah.
R:  I blame it on -- I guess I blame it on I've been too busy, but really, you know, you shouldn't really use that as an excuse, I guess.
L:  You're right.  [LAUGH].
R:  But um, a -- a couple of years ago, I used to be very, very thin, but then I went to college, you know, and then that ended.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But um a couple years ago I lost about thirty pounds, which I was really at my idea weight then, but --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it slowly came back on.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But at that time, I taught at a school that was very supportive.  We used to do aerobics videos every day after school.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Three days a week.  Everybody learnt it together so that really kind of kept each other on track.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Whereas now, it's not really that kind of situation for me.  But you know, I have a double stroller and I know I can [inaudible] in there and go walk, but it's just -- I don't know.  I now eat tons and tons of crap all the time.
L:  Yeah.  That's my downfall at night.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Well, sitting in front of the computer, I know I always make myself a little snack and I sit there and just --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- chomp away while I'm surfing on the internet.
L:  Yeah, before you know it, there's a bag of chips gone.  [LAUGH].
R:  I know it.  And like, today, I thought, okay you know, I'll go for a walk this morning, I want to eat a little better and um I had a horrible lunch, and then my daughter had chicken nuggets and I ate the rest of hers that she didn't finish.
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH].
R:  I'm like, oh, there's just three left.  I'll just try and eat those.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then I'm thinking, no, no, that's wrong, that's wrong.
L:  [LAUGH].  But it's --
R:  So --
L:  -- wasting money if you didn't.
R:  I know it, but --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- see, because that's what all the books tell you, don't finish the food on your children's plates.
L:  [LAUGH].  
R:  So -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  But um, we've joined up the swimming pool this summer, we'll go there.  You know, that'll -- that'll get us outside a little bit.
L:  Yeah.  That's good exercise.
R:  Yeah.  You know, it was just that baby weight, it takes forever to lose.
L:  Oh, it does.  Definitely.
R:  I -- I can remember with my first one, um, it took me almost -- like, after a year, I really felt like my stomach had gone down, 'cause I had C sections with both.
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  And um, it just takes a long time.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And you know, I know everyone says with the uh, the second one takes even longer and a lot of times it never goes away.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  So, if you look at my family, there's pretty much a history there.
L:  Yes.  [LAUGH].
R:  So I'm trying -- have to try something, though.
L:  Oh, when we got married, I was quite tiny.
R:  Mhm.
L:  The old story.
R:  I know. 
L:  But we've been married quite a few decades.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  Well, you know, I have friends who are single, and um, you know they have to look nice.  They're still dating and trying to find a husband and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- yeah, I've been married eight years and um, it just doesn't seem -- he doesn't really care either, 'cause he could stand to lose a little weight, too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  I think we -- we get that way because we get married.
R:  Mm.
L:  We're comfortable with each other --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- and before you know it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- there's two of you.  [LAUGH].
R:  But I'm turning -- um, I'm turning thirty in the fall, so I know if I turn thirty and I'm fat, I will be very different [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I -- I'm like, one thirty at thirty, I have to lose some weight.
L:  Mm.  [LAUGH].
R:  So, that's kinda my goal, but I haven't really done anything for it yet.
L:  No.  
R:  But, I don't know, I used to be very athletic, but I don't know, I just would rather sit around and do nothing, but I think it's because I don't exercise, I have no stamina at all.
L:  Probably a support group of you?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm.  That would probably work.
R:  All of my friends are always trying to lose weight, too, but you know, we always want a quick fix.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, we know it doesn't work.
L:  Right.  
R:  But we want just something quick that's going to, um, end thin.
L:  Well, healthwise, it wouldn't work either.
R:  No.  
L:  Besides, you wouldn't lose the weight then.  [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  I know you have to be really careful because, like, my daughter's three and you know, I don't want to stay, like, fat because I don't want her to feel like --
L:  That's right.
R:  I can remember my mom my whole life being on diets.
L:  Mm.
R:  And I don't want her to be like that.  I just want her to see, you know, mommy's trying to be healthier to keep up with you.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  So I try to say that all the time, like, mommy's trying to be healthy.  That's why mommy's just --
L:  That's a good point.
R:  Yeah, 'cause so many girls have such um -- you know, eating disorders or they have negative images about their bodies.
L:  Mm.  
R:  That, you know, I really don't want -- I mean -- I'm -- I'm short.  I'm only five feet tall and um, she's going to be --
L:  Oh, you're tall.
R:  Huh?
L:  You're tall.
R:  Oh, really?  
L:  I'm four ten.
R:  Really?
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, so you know -- when I joined Weight Watchers, the lady said, "Honey, you're not overweight, you're just under tall".
L:  Well, yes.
R:  And I thought, you know, I can't do anything about that.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  So, you know, my whole -- I know my daughter's -- you know, gonna have -- she's probably going to have to watch her weight, too, as she gets older.
L:  Yeah.
R:  She'll be thin probably until college, too, and then --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it'll start adding up on her.  But I don't know, it's always a constant struggle, and I know it's like a lifetime of changes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, you have to just let this --
L:  Where are you from?
R:  Um, I'm from Illinois.
L:  Oh.  I'm New Hampshire.
R:  Oh, really?  But I live in -- I live in North Carolina now.  My husband --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and I live down here in Ch- um, in North Carolina.
L:  Oh, I have relatives down there.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Mm.
R:  Oh, it's beautiful here.  I never want to live in --
L:  It is.
R:  -- Illinois again.  
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  It's so much nicer here.  The weather's very nice.
L:  Mm.  In the Marine Corps?
R:  No.
L:  No?
R:  He just -- -- um, he works in motor sports.
L:  Oh.  
R:  So, we moved down here.
L:  Well, my relatives are in the Marine Corps.  
R:  Oh, really?
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  No, we live um, we just moved down for, like, motor sport engine building, that kinda stuff.  
L:  Oh.
R:  So --
L:  Well, that's good exercise, go out and root for him and --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Well, I sit in front of the TV.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  Ah --
R:  Well, our think our ten minutes are probably almost up.
L:  I would think so.
R:  I don't know how often they're supposed to call you about this?
L:  Well, from what I hear, it's -- some people get every day and some get every other day.
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  Right.
R:  You just never know?
L:  And it's only three days.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm.  Then they might ask you to do more.
R:  Uh-huh.   Well, good.
L:  That's nice.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, you know --
L:  I can use the money.  [LAUGH].
R:  -- you -- you see so many things on the internet, you're not really sure.
L:  Right.
R:  Of what really works or what doesn't.  But --
L:  Well, this um -- sounded great.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And she presented right, and it's from a university college --
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  So I thought I'd give it a shot.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  But --
L:  And I'm not exercising doing it, so [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH].  I know.  Well, like I say, I got up this morning and I walked -- I -- I walked and I ran a little bit, like, three fourths a mile, and my whole body just hurts today.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I'm, like, I need to take some ibuprofen, I think, because I'm really tired now.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, you were using muscles you weren't used to using for a while.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  So when you go tomorrow, they'll hurt less and less.
R:  I know, I --
