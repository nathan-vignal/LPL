L:  Hi, I'm Lisa.  
R:  Hi, I'm Amanda.  How are you?
L:  I'm fine.  How are you?
R:  I'm good.  Where are you calling from?
L:  Orlando, Florida.
R:  I'm calling from [inaudible] City, New Jersey.
L:  Ah.  Quite a distance.
R:  Do you participate -- I'm sorry?
L:  [LAUGH].  I said quite a distance from each other.
R:  It is.  It is.  How's the weather over there?
L:  Oh, it's wonderful.  How's the weather up there?
R:  Um, it was raining past couple of days, crappy Memorial Weekend, but very -- very good today.  Mid --
L:  My son's up on --
R:  -- sixties.  
L:  My son's up there in Long Island.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right.  Cool.  Um, so I'm guessing that the topic is health and fitness?
L:  Mm.
R:  Do you, um, participate in any of it?  Like, on a daily basis or no?
L:  Ah, I try to walk a couple of times a week.  My husband --
R:  Um, may I ask -- may I ask how old you are?
L:  Huh?
R:  May I ask how old you are?
L:  Yeah, I'm forty.  
R:  Oh re- no way.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  You do not sound forty at all.  Seriously.
L:  I -- I'll be forty one on the fifteenth of June.
R:  Well, congratulations.
L:  Thank you.
R:  Seriously.  Oh, that's wonderful.
L:  In fact, my son and -- and my uh daughter in law are up there in Long Island, and they are expecting my first granddaughter.  My grandch- I mean, grandchild.  I got a grandson on the way, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I have two step grandchildren.
R:  Oh, well that's even --
L:  So they keep --
R:  That's even more of a reason to want to be healthy enough to see them grow up.
L:  Yep.  I um, I try to -- I have a lot of back injury, so I try to stay very active.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And do a lot of walking.  Um, I can't do much other exercises because back injuries do limit me to what I can do.
R:  Do you have herniated discs or is it --
L:  I have --
R:  -- just strain?
L:  -- seven damaged discs.
R:  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.
L:  Two of them have arthritis in them.
R:  I -- I actually attend Bally's[?] and uh -- Bally's World of Fitness, and um, what they do is, believe it or not, there are a lot of people that come in, like, after therapy sessions and things like that and they -- they decide to get a membership, and believe it or not, the best things that they decide to do for back injuries are, like, the sauna, the hot tubs, things like that, and they really, you know, try to keep that going as much as they possibly can.  Um, hang on one second?
L:  Sure.  
R:  Um, and actually what they do is also they do a lot of, um, pilates.  Have you ever heard of that?
L:  No.  What's pilates?
R:  Um, it's mo- it's kind of like an Italian, uh, form of exercising, and it's actually uh mostly abs.  It's a lot of abs and strength training and things like that.  Um, but it's -- it's something that you can do to actually build up the strength in your lower back --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- which would then help -- yeah, without -- without, like, strain of, like, lifting weights and stuff like that.
L:  Would that help tone the belly?
R:  Yes, it will.  Everything for abs is exactly what it's worth --
L:  That's the only place that I'm getting fat, is in my stomach, because I can't exercise it because of the low back injuries.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Mm.  And it's very depressing, being you know, a very slender lady that has always looked good; now all of a sudden it's, like, the pants aren't holding it in any more.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  No, I know, and you know what?  You shouldn't -- you shouldn't have to feel like you need something else in order to do that.  Um, but yeah, seriously, like if you were ever interested in it, and believe it or not, people don't think so, but it actually does help, yoga.  Yoga --
L:  Yoga?
R:  -- actually is the best, um, way to lose weight without killing yourself on a cardio machine.
L:  Cool.
R:  And without -- yeah.  And believe it or not, it -- they teach you kind of how to meditate.  They teach you, um, how to stretch properly so you don't ever pull your back, you don't ever pull your arms, you don't you know, pull any hamstrings, and quite honestly, you gain more -- more muscle tone and your abs gets a lot tighter a lot faster with yoga because people don't realize it, they think that they need to do, like, more repetitions or more weight in order to --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- make something, you know, like more toner and it's what -- believe it or not, it's just pace.  The slower --
L:  What --
R:  -- that you do something, the more -- the more concentrated --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the muscle becomes.
L:  That's what I tell my husband, is that he's like, "Well, let's go get bicycles", and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I'm like, "No, let's walk instead, walking is better than bicycling".
R:  You think so?
L:  Yeah, because they're saying that, you know, you're getting -- it gets your blood pumping better.  Um, I don't think that a deteriorating hip would do very well on a bicycle.
R:  Believe it or not, okay, honestly, I -- I understand, I understand your -- what that -- um, the only -- the only argument that I can make towards that is the fact that, um, you can get a cruiser bike which hon- which is a bike that's very comfortable, it allows you to sit upright --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and you don't have to, like, sp- you know, scrunch over and hold the handlebars.  Like, you know the way like a normal mountain bike would be or a child's bike or something?
L:  Right.
R:  They have cruiser bikes where you actually sit completely up and the seat is wide enough where you're actually completely comfortable.  You're no- you don't feel like you have like some sort of stick up your rear end and -- and that's terrible.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  But seriously, and the be- the best thing about biking, believe it or not, is that not only do you -- I mean, walking -- believe me, I mean, you work every muscle in your body, including your stomach when you walk, but when you are on a bike, you are not only -- do -- putting your heart rate up faster, but if you do any kind of inclines or any kind of little hills or anything like that, you're not only working your arms, your back, your stomach, your calves, you're working everything.  Whereas if you were walking, you might want to stop faster or more often.
L:  Well, I would -- I think that with the, um, the bicycling would be as bad on my hip as doing stairs because it -- they made me move from a three storey apartment to a house because the stairs were just -- just making --
R:  Too much.
L:  -- my hip deteriorate too much.
R:  Right.
L:  And that's what I thought that a bicycle would do the same thing.  That's why I -- I enjoy doing my walking every night.
R:  Right.
L:  We live in --
R:  Do you always walk on flat terrain, or do you ever do hills or anything like that?
L:  Well, I mean, most of it's pretty wo- pretty flat.  There's a -- I mean, there's a little bit of -- well, it's -- Florida's very flat.  [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  Right.  Right.
L:  There's not too much terrains here or any -- we're pretty flat.  I mean, what they call hills --
R:  What kind of distance do you do?
L:  Huh?
R:  Do you just do, like, city blocks?  Do you do blocks or do you do or like parks --
L:  Yeah, we do -- we walk our neighborhood.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We live in a really great neighborhood.  Everybody's friendly, everybody's always usually out working in their yards or they're walking every night and it's just like -- it's cool.  We can --
R:  Very nice.  Do you have a -- do you have a dog?
L:  No.  
R:  Oh.  Well, that would be ano- that -- I mean, not that I'm telling you to go out and get a dog, by no means, but I think that if you did, that'd also be another way to actually, you know, probe you to want to go outside more, and maybe your husband too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, because I know they like to hit the couch a lot.  My dad's that way and my mom's very eager to go out and walk and my dad's like, "Oh, I'm gonna watch my show" and --
L:  Well, if he's dieting, he wants to walk.  It's just that he's a computer repairman and he's out walking the malls every day repairing computers --
R:  Right.
L:  -- here and there, and he just -- he's tired when he gets home.
R:  I understand fully.
L:  But I motivate him a lot.
R:  Wow.
L:  I'm like, "Let's go.  Let's go". 
R:  What about -- what about have you guys ever tried, like, maybe doing something together, as far as like maybe like if you were out in the park or something, I don't know, like frisbee or any type of, like you know, catching?  You know, and it sounds really childish, it sounds really like almost pretty immature, but I mean, seriously it's a lot of fun.  Like, I play catch with my boyfriend --
L:  We do --
R:  -- and that's like hysterical to us because we see each other become very vulnerable and like really [LAUGH] really become kids again in each other's face --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I think it's so very funny.
L:  We do a lot of walking now.  We'll go to parks and stuff and just -- just go walk.  You know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Get hand in hand and walk.  I mean -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and we do it at the malls, you know?  We may not have any money, but we'll go to the mall 'cause it's nice and cool and it's like --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- a hundred degrees out and we'll just walk the whole mall, and you know --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- when you got two storey malls around here, they are --
R:  Yeah, I know.  I know.  I've been to the -- I've been to a mall in Florida.  I -- I've -- I was actually out there last year, but I was in Miami.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And uh, I know -- I know what it's like.  And believe it or not, even on a nice night, it's nice to just be outside when, like, the wind is really like blowing really -- when it's just cool air, and it's not like humid and terrible outside.
L:  Right.
R:  And you want to just go for a nice walk and sight see or --
L:  Well, Miami's a little hotter than Orlando 'cause --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you're more south, but --
R:  I've been to Orlando, too, even when I was younger.  I went with my parents when I went on vacation with them so I know, like even by the hotel areas and things like that.  I mean, I remember it being breezy out by the pool at night and stuff --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like that and it was really, really nice.  Wow.  Have you -- have you ever like um thought of any other -- like, do you guys swim?  Or would you swim?  Would you ever do, like, aquatic aerobics or anything?
L:  Yeah.  I've thought about it.  We're -- we're thinking that when um we move out of this place, 'cause we're only renting, but next year when we buy a house, we're gonna buy a house with a swimming pool.
R:  Oh, nice.
L:  'Cause we both -- we both enjoy swimming.  I just don't care to go into public pools.
R:  Right.  I understand.
L:  I would much rather have my own swimming pool and I just -- I don't feel very comfortable in public pools.
R:  Right.  
L:  But um --
R:  No, I -- I can totally understand that.  See, I'm a little bit more, I guess, open to it only because I -- I want to go get sort of -- had to be a lifeguard so it's kinda like more of a -- you know, I guess it's just an eagerness in me to wanna like -- you know what I'm saying?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Just -- I don't know, I guess professionally do it, but um I remember --
L:  Yeah.  Both my kids are swimmers.  In fact, they both went for their certification on uh life guarding, but they couldn't maneuver the one -- the one most important part and that was going to the bottom and bringing the --
R:  To get the brick?  Yeah.  
L:  Picking the dummy up.
R:  Picking up the brick?
L:  No, they have a dummy.
R:  Oh.  Okay.
L:  That's down at the bottom and both of them, as soon as they got down towards the bottom, their ears popped and they just come right back up.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So it just was too much -- too much on them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause my daughter's twenty one.  She'd love to get her lifeguard -- and my son's eighteen and he's, like -- he went through all the stuff with Boy Scouts.
R:  Right.  
L:  And uh, but they -- they -- now the grandkids really keep me going.  They come over and I'm like a little kid.  Me and my husband are like little kids.  We're down on the floor playing with them and --
R:  Right.  
L:  -- being goofy and, yeah --
R:  That's great.  
L:  If you ever --
R:  That's absolutely great.
L:  If I knew --
