L:  Hi my name is Bambi. 
R:  Hi I'm Debbie. 
L:  Hi Debbie how are you? 
R:  I'm fine how are you doing? 
L:  Good.  I didn't really get what -- what that was the topic, um, --
R:  The topic is, um, --
L:  Censorship. 
R:  Censorship of books in uh, public and private schools.  Do they have the right to censor them.  [NOISE]
L:  Right, um, I'm not even aware of the fact that that's happening.
R:  Oh, yeah they don't allow certain books in school.  That's always been a given.
L:  Oh, okay it's just certain titles that they don't allow or do they actually censor certain parts in books? 
R:  Um, certain titles I believe. 
L:  Right and I mean is that because they don't feel it's literature or because it's lewd or pornographic or -- or --
R:  Probably because it's lewd or pornographic I think.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- See I didn't go to school in this country so --
R:  Uh.  
L:  I'm not really aware of that.
R:  Yeah probably because of the content of the book they would censor it.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  And yeah I think they should do.
L:  You do? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Why? 
R:  Well you certainly wouldn't want them reading certain books if they're in like third grade.
L:  Right but does -- this does this go across the board with -- with you know every age group at school or does it depend on what age they are that certain books are censored.
R:  Well actually I think they should keep all like pornographic and lewd out of the school.
L:  Okay but who gets --
R:  Regardless of age.
L:  Yeah but who gets to decide what is you know worth censoring and what isn't?
R:  As a general rule the school board. 
L:  Right and I mean I kind of wonder you know how strict they are because there are definitely certain works of literature that you know might be censored but then are definitely considered you know works of literature and --
R:  Works of art -- yeah.
L:  -- works of art and very well written.  I mean I can see where you know they're not allowed to read a Playboy magazine for -- for school paper that would make sense to me.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, yeah I mean there are certain works that are considered erotica that I feel as a student would want to read that and if they have a good argument for reading that and if their parents allow it I -- I feel as the parents should really be the one's that decide what the kids can read or not.
R:  Yeah but if it's something they give -- like in oral report you know.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  Then all of the students are hearing it you know at least in that class anyway and you would have to have all of the parents agreed that can do that.  [NOISE]
L:  That's true but what about when it comes to like works that cover religion or politics, I mean that can be a very sensitive topic as well.
R:  Yeah.  [inaudible]
L:  I mean you're obviously going to get things that not everybody agrees on, um, and I think that someone can still do an oral report on a work that is considered erotica without getting graphic about the details.
R:  Yeah but then they'd have to read the book you know and the book is going to be very graphic.  I certainly wouldn't let mine do it.
L:  Right would you put a certain curb on -- on the age? 
R:  Um, actually you know, um, if they want to read that kind of stuff you know and their parents let them they can always do that outside of school.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  So I don't believe that at any age should they read it in school.  [NOISE] I mean except like college or something you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Over eighteen, the age of consent.
L:  Right.
R:  It's their prerogative. 
L:  Yeah I don't totally agree with you, I -- I really feel that people should you know if you -- if you turn something into taboo subject it's just going to make kids a lot more curious.
R:  Oh, let's face it they're going to read it anyway but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you want to be able to control at least some aspect.
L:  Yeah but up to what point do you enforce that control?  I mean when you turn it into something where you know you're taking away the -- the whole forbidden fruit aspect of things and you're basically you know, um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- teaching what can be good and what can be not so good about it.
R:  Well see that's the parent's job you know to educate their children at home about these kinds of things.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know I don't feel that has a place in the school.
L:  Right.
R:  Cause it's the parent's job to educate their children about this anyway.
L:  Yeah well I agree with you there.
R:  It's not the school system job to raise your children.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And decide what they think is better you know.  I mean at some point yes, but --
L:  But is there -- is there a point where you say okay the school goes too far with -- with censoring certain things or do you feel that [inaudible] --
R:  Well that's what school boards elected officials.
L:  Right.
R:  You know you elect officials with your viewpoints.
L:  Mhm.  But what about, um, for instance a book like, um, there's a -- a -- a quite a well known piece of Nazi literature called [inaudible] I think it was written by Hitler, um, and that book has been like illegal in a lot of countries for many years because it's considered Nazi propaganda.  Now there are people who would argue that not being allowed to read that book will only go to feed people that you know might be interested in -- in, um, fascism in the first place where as if you allow people to read it then they can find out for themselves what is wrong and what is right about it.
R:  Um, actually I don't believe that you know just because they read something doesn't mean they are going to do it you know.
L:  Mhm.  So do you believe that should be censored or should not be censored?
R:  I think it should be censored.
L:  It should?
R:  I certainly wouldn't want my kids reading about, uh, Hitler's exploitations. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Not to that extent and you know that graphic at that age.
L:  Right.
R:  You know and they didn't -- you know though no -- as a general rule you know what kind of things he did but they don't need to know into extreme details here.
L:  Uh-huh.  And then what about stuff like, um, for instance something that Malcolm X has written about his believings and teachings, how would you feel about that? 
R:  Um, when you get into religion that's a whole different matter you know if you're going to say something about one religion you need to kind of give them an overview on every religion.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You can't just say one -- about one religion if you're going to talk anything at all about any religion you need to kind of cover all of the bases.
L:  Mhm.  But do you think the schools do that? 
R:  Actually the school have a big tendency to stay away from religion.
L:  Right.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I mean some of them they make a comment or two here and there you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but as a general rule they don't incorporate too much religion.
L:  Right but do you think that's a good thing or do you --
R:  Yeah because you know they shouldn't be able to push one religion or the other.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  I mean again it comes into parental control.
L:  Right and are -- are there things that you believe are being censored now that -- that you feel should not be censored or --
R:  Oh, I'm sure they've censored some things that you know I wouldn't think would need to be censored.
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  But --
L:  Like what? 
R:  Oh, I don't know I'm sure that there are certain works of art you know that they censor.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  On that basis you know a little too graphic or something.
L:  Right I mean some people I guess would argue that you know, um, the school isn't the place for -- for children to be exposed to any form of nudity, where as lot of art you know the great masters, um, --
R:  Is nudity.
L:  -- is nudity, so how would you feel about that? 
R:  Oh, when you're getting into works of art though that's -- I don't know I've never really thought about that cause they don't really cover that you know.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  Great works of art until later on you know in education.
L:  Right. 
R:  I know pretty much you know about growing when they start go nothing to that.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean sure they cover a few works of art you know.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  But I don't think they get too well into it until they're quite a bit older you know.
L:  Uh-huh.  But do you -- I mean would you be, um, against it if they were to expose like younger children like say in elementary school to -- to certain works of art? 
R:  Oh, I don't think so I mean you know they're classics and children actually need to you know be familiar with body parts.
L:  Right.
R:  You know like that is one case where you -- if you hide it you know they really do want to get more into that.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean you know --
L:  Yeah I mean I find in this country -- I mean I grew up in Europe, and over there people are --
R:  A lot more free.
L:  -- yeah tend to be a lot more liberal about everything but it -- it kind of takes away the whole forbidden fruit aspect of things because of that I mean I -- I find that here, um, teenagers tend to be a lot more fascinated by everything that's forbidden just because it is forbidden and it's secret and you know that makes it exciting.
R:  [NOISE] Then again that goes back to you know their parental.
L:  Right.
R:  You know how they're raised and what their parents allow you know.
L:  Right.
R:  Like mine's pretty much you can discuss anything you know.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  And I turn thirty shades of red after you walk out of the room but --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] You know they feel free to ask anything.
L:  Right.
R:  You know no topic is taboo you know if you want to discuss religion that's fine you know.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  Even if I don't believe the same religion you know.
L:  Right well that's good though but I -- I was reading quite recently some article in the newspaper I think that said that -- that a lot of kids basically aren't raised at all anymore at home it's like they're --
R:  No they expect the school system to do so.
L:  Exactly and the parents don't really give them any morals or values and they just you know they leave it all to the school which is placing a huge responsibility on the schools.
