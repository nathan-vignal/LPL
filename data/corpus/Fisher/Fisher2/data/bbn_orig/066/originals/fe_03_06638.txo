L:  Hi there.
R:  Hi.
L:  I'm Renee, what's your name?
R:  Paul. [SIGH]
L:  Hi, Paul.
R:  Hi, uh, --
L:  So, I guess the subject is whether or not public or private schools can l- -- can make students read certain books?
R:  Yeah, that's what I understood.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I'm a school teacher, so this is kind of interesting.  [LAUGH]
R:  well, [LAUGH] I don't think that students should be able to -- ah, they should mandate what books they read.
L:  So, teachers and parents should choose, or teachers?
R:  Well, the t- -- ah, teachers more or less should choose.
L:  Right, I pretty much agree, --
R:  -- and --
L:  Yeah.  Unless somebody had some really big problem with something, I don't know, because of their, -- I don't know, maybe if they had some religious belief or something that didn't allow it, but, I don't see any -- I can't think of any situation where that would occur, you know?
R:  Ah, well, I wouldn't either, but I would think that there should be some supervision from the parent too, you know, that -- to check and see what kind the contents of the books are, before their ch- --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- child starts reading them.
L:  Yeah, that's probably a good idea, too.  I agree.  Do you have kids?
R:  Oh, yeah, I have children, but they're usually, ah, -- they're pretty much, well, all of mine are older, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but the grandchildren, ah, they can pick out some craziest things in the library.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Public library or the school library.
R:  Oh, both.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  But I -- I -- they have brought home books from the school library that -- that I didn't approve of, you know.
L:  Really?
R:  And --
L:  What kind of things?
R:  Well it was, um, some of it would be sexual contents, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and some, ah, real murder, and all of that, you know, a lot of mayhem, --
L:  Yeah, I kind of -- ghost stories, but kind of turned almost into thriller type things.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- yeah, I don't like things like that very much either, it seems like fifth grade boys want to read those all the time.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, ah, well, ah, all of them want to read Harry Potter, but you can't expect them to --
L:  I'm sorry, what did you say?  All of them read Harry Hotter?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I haven't ever read one of those books?  I own a couple of them, but, I've never read them and, they were real popular, like, a couple years ago.
R:  I've been thinking about taking the time to read one just to see what it was.
L:  Right, yeah.  I know some people don't like those books because they have some, I guess it's kind of, it's not really witchcraft, but magic and stuff in it, --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- some people don't like it for that reason, but, um, yeah, one of teachers was, uh, -- one of my friends was talking about teaching that in a class and, we all said, probably not a good idea.  [LAUGH] not all the parents are going to approve of that, you know.
R:  I wouldn't think so.
L:  I wouldn't think so either, I don't know, we're out here in New Mexico, and, um, it can be fairly liberal but there's different little pockets of people who probably wouldn't, um, appreciate it, you know.
R:  My -- my daughter's also a school teacher, --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- well, she is teaching now, she's, ah, teaching English as a second language, --
L:  Oh, --
R:  -- we're in North Carolina.
L:  Oh, North Carolina.
R:  -- and we have a lot of migrant workers, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and --
L:  Are they from Mexico?  Mostly, or?
R:  Yeah, Mexico, and, ah, -- right now, she's working with a group that's from Thailand, --
L:  Really?
R:  They --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- that's opening up a big John Dear's tractor company right outside of Charlotte, and they're sending a lot of, ah, Thai people over here.  So, --
L:  Oh, wow, so, are you, are you in the tri-city area there, Charlotte, Durham, --
R:  Yeah -- uh-huh, --
L:  Raleigh?  Yeah, I have a friend that lives there.  Haven't -- haven't ever been there, it's supposed to be really pretty.  It's real green, huh?
R:  Oh, yeah, kind of -- well, it's kind of wet, now, though.
L:  It's -- it's pretty wet?
R:  Pretty wet.
L:  Yeah, we actually have a little bit of a rainstorm right now, which is just so wonderful, 'cause it's way too dry out here, we've had a drought for a few years.
R:  Oh, we have too, it's been about, ah, about seven days raining, and it's pretty bad, but [COUGH] --
L:  Wow! You have flooding out there?
R:  Oh, yes, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- flood -- all -- we live in between two river basins, and both of them are flooding.
L:  Oh, goodness.
R:  [MN] Yes, so you just have to sit here and hope it doesn't get too high.
L:  Right.
R:  But --
L:  Well, we always think it's just amazing, we get a little tiny bit of rain, it's kind of spitting rain right now at sun set, --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and we're happy for it. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I'm sure you are --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in New Mexico.
L:  It's pretty dry out here, we're in Albuquerque and it's just -- it's just way too dry.
R:  Mhm, well, how is the school system in Albuquerque?
L:  How are they?  I think they're pretty good.  I work for Albuquerque public schools, I just started working for them, I was working for a place out, um, east of here, on the other side of mountains, which, um, -- it was a good school district but it was just too far to drive, --
R:  Yeah. [MN]
L:  -- that was Moriarty's schools, but I think they're pretty good, um, I don't know, we've, ah, -- our school was above, um, average standards in terms of our testing and things like that, but, um, it kind of varies from school to school, teacher to teacher, you know, just like any place, but, ah,   -- we have a lot of bilingual programs and, English as a second language, too, we have a folks that come here from Mexico and, have a real high, ah, Vietnamese community, --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- big numbers.  Over by the Air Force base, there's a lot of, um, Asian immigrants, so, yeah, it's a little bit of everything.
R:  Well, it's nice, I, well, I always enjoy talking with teachers, I have a real good friend who was assistant superintendent of schools for the county, --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- and, um, of course, ah, he and I went through scouts together and everything, but we were in Australia couple of years ago, and this was -- I mean, he's real -- I mean, he's goes over everything, we were looking at this old cargo ship, ah, shipping ship, that was eighteen, seventeen -- late seventeen hundreds.
L:  -- Mhm.
R:  -- and, out of nowhere, he says, "Did you ever get your explorer scout merit badge?", I said, "Hank, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I mean, that's heck of a time to be --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- talking about" -- [LAUGH]
L:  Years later! [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] All these years later, now, I said, "You were in my patrol, and you knew I had it!"  But anyways --
L:  [LAUGH] so you were in Scouting for years and years, huh?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  That's a good thing to be in, a fellow from my church is in it, and he's -- he's actually an adult leader for his son's scouts, and they're all Eagle Scouts and everything, so --
R:  Oh, yeah, that's great.
L:  That's good.
R:  But you -- but you get it through the education.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Your public schools and, if -- if the public schools were really enthused and push it, ah, they could turn out some real good students.
L:  Oh, yeah, definitely, I agree, --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- unfortunately, not, in my opinion, not enough teachers have high enough standards, so, the kids are learning stuff that's -- I don't think it's at the right level, they're learning things, like, in fifth grade, they're learning things they should have learned at the end of third grade, you know.
R:  Mhm. It -- well, the only problem I have with the city schools here -- as long as you have a -- a high school diploma, you can be a substitute sch- school teacher.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, you don't have a have a degree in -- ah, any kind of degree, --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- they're so, uh, short of school teachers, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and -- and --
L:  They used to have that here.  But now you have to have a degree.
R:  Uh-huh. But -- and -- and I can understand why, ah, because they won't p- -- they won't pay the people what they're -- I mean, the education budget is just [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's really low, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's true.
R:  I don't know, I can't -- and yet they [MN] expect you to turn out Einsteins, and it's just -- it's just not right for the -- the school teachers themselves to live [MN] just above the poverty line, --
L:  I agree.  [LAUGH]
R:  And [MN] it's just something -- and -- and yet, they waste so much taxpayers' money on other things, --
L:  Yeah, it's true, I know.  I, ah, I'm, I'm having to, -- not having to, but because I want to make repairs on my house, I'm taking a summer job, you know, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  To -- to make sure that I can be able to do it.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and that's just the way it is, you know, it's just [MN], it's kind of harsh, people say, "Well, do you really have to do that?"  A couple of my friends, their wives stay home with their kids and, they're teachers, one's a principal and they work even on the weekends during the school year.  You know.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it's terrible that -- that, that the teachers have it to do this, because, -- in -- in order to -- to, ah, to have a comfortable income, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it's just, I don't know, but, --
L:  Yep, I know, I agree.  [LAUGH] Have you done many of these calls before, have you done a couple before?
R:  Um, this is the second one.
L:  Yeah, this is my third and it's funny, because, every time I'm talking, we always get off the subject, because the subject, you can only talk about it for, like, three minutes and, then, --
R:  Ah, well, look --
L:  -- you always go off the subject and start asking the other person where they live, or, --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know.  [LAUGH]
R:  My first one, he was -- he was from Idaho and, a snowboarder, and I know absolutely nothing about snowboarding.
L:  [LAUGH] That's funny.
R:  [LAUGH] Mhm.
L:  I talked to a lady who lived in Chicago and she was Chinese, her husband was a student here and she wanted to stay here in America, so that was kind of interesting.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Talking to people all over
