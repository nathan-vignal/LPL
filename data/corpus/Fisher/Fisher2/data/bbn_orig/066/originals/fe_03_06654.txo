R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  [LAUGH].  How are you?
L:  Good.  
R:  Good.  [LAUGH].
L:  My name is Penny.
R:  My name is Samantha.
L:  Oh.  I'm up in Michigan.
R:  I am in Maryland.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, are you?
R:  Yes, I am.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh.  How's the weather there?
R:  Rain, rain, rain.
L:  Yeah.  We're kinda getting over that right now.
R:  Oh, we had a brief break yesterday and now it is continued back to --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- becoming cloudy again.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yep.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, we're supposed to talk about fitness exercise?  [LAUGH].
L:  Health, fitness and exercise.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].  Do you work out?
L:  Um, you know, I don't work out, but I live right across the street from, like, a memorial school.
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  And they have a track over there and about the last month, as the weather's kinda started breaking, I do go over and I walk, every day.  
R:  Oh, that's good.  That's exercise.
L:  So I -- I do try to at least get one or two miles in now.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I needed it after winter.  [LAUGH].
R:  Well, that's good.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Um, I'm a mother of five, so I get plenty of exercise.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, my goodness, yes.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  I have, uh, a fourteen year old, all the way down to one who will be a year old on Thursday.
L:  Oh.  
R:  And I work out, I do little squats and stuff like that, but most of my work is -- workout has become lifting laundry baskets and picking up children and clothing and --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- things of that nature.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yep.  I have a five, a four and a two, so [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.
L:  I know exactly what it is.  Actually, we -- I usually take the two older ones across the street with me and they ride their bikes around while I walk.  So that gets them out and gets them doing something too.
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You hear someone crying, that's my youngest.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, hey, I know how it is.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  He's the only one home with me during the day.
L:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH].
R:  All the rest of them are in school and -- but -- well, between dropping them off and picking them up, it's always --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- interesting.
L:  Oh, yes.  I can imagine.  [LAUGH].
R:  You can imagine.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yep.  
R:  And do your kids exercise or --
L:  Um, I got one that's in T ball.  She was old enough for T ball this year.  But actually my kids are very outdoor kids.  Much more than I am.  [LAUGH].
R:  That's how mine are.  They're constantly -- we have them in baseball and --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- soccer and --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- everything and --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- my youngest daughter, she now wants to play tennis.  She just -- just signed up for soccer.
L:  Oh.
R:  And has played two games and now she wants to do tennis.
L:  How old is she?
R:  She's only four.  [LAUGH].
L:  Really?  And they do tennis for her?
R:  Yeah.  We have a tennis club --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- close by, that you know I thought, maybe I'll join, you know?  [LAUGH].
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  While she's there, I can go play tennis myself.  It's an indoor tennis thing.  So --
L:  How nice.
R:  Yeah.  And then my oldest one, he's so tiny, he's -- he's fourteen, but he's -- he wears size tens in --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- boys' clothing, so he's -- he's very tiny.
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  And small.  He tried playing football and baseball and everything else, but he is a whiz at soccer.  
L:  Huh.
R:  And he has gotten invited to a invitational thing for soccer.
L:  And soccer is really starting to take off, I think --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- around the United States where it wasn't before.
R:  Yeah, it seems a lot more popular.
L:  Yep.  Yep.
R:  See, I wish they had, like, a women's ice hockey --
L:  Really?  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  Well, you probably have those clubs up in Michigan?
L:  The hockey and stuff?
R:  For -- yeah.  For, like, a woman --
L:  Yeah, we have a lot of them around town.  I don't know about women's hockey.  I've never even looked into that.
R:  I would just -- I'm very small myself [LAUGH] --
L:  Really?
R:  I'm only five foot tall and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- hundred pounds on a good day.  [LAUGH].
L:  As a matter of fact, we have three rinks right here in Jackson and we're not that big of a town, so --
R:  Ow --
L:  -- yeah, we do -- we do have quite a bit of that.  
R:  Yeah, we ha- we have one that's -- I don't know, it's about fifteen minutes away, but I'm border Delaware, Jersey --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and Pennsylvania so we kinda -- yeah we're smack dab in the middle of Philadelphia and Baltimore.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so we have to usually go to the next city or something, but we do have, I think, two or three ice arenas within twenty miles of us, but --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- they do not have women's.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH].  Maybe some day.  [LAUGH].
R:  Ah, yeah, I'd hope, but there's not many thirty something year old women who want to do something like that.  [LAUGH].
L:  Want to do hockey?  [LAUGH].
R:  I just love watching it on television and --
L:  Uh-huh.  Yep.  
R:  -- and it -- I can't even ice skate, so how -- [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  They'd have to --
L:  Then that might be kinda difficult.
R:  Yeah, they'd have to give an instructional think, I think.
L:  Yep.  Yep.  [LAUGH].  Mm.
R:  And if you do participate in many of these --
L:  You know what?  This is actually my first Fisher call, but I've done other, you know, mystery shops and stuff like that.
R:  Oh, have you?
L:  Yep.  I actually found out about this on a refunding site online.
R:  Oh, that's great.
L:  Yeah, how uh -- yeah.  'Cause a lot of the women and stuff were on there doing it and they were talking about it and I thought, God, that sounds really interesting.
R:  Yeah, this is my first one, too.
L:  Yep.
R:  I just started Friday.  I believe -- my husband and I used to be a school teacher and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and uh --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  It -- the hours are just way too demanding and everybody's like, oh yeah, you have your summers off, but you just -- it's unbelievable the amount of hours you have to put in and you're so poorly paid and [LAUGH] --
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  I can't participate in my children's things at their school because I'm teaching in another school and --
L:  Right. 
R:  And it'd -- had become very difficult so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I decided to uh go back into visual merchandising which hasn't been my thing --
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  -- for many years and then all of a sudden I stopped and just sat home and had --
L:  Really?
R:  Yes, and it's kinda the way I'm filling the void financially.  [LAUGH].
L:  Uh-huh.   Yep.  Yep, it's hard.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I know, I have -- my degree is actually in marketing, but uh then I took the time off with the three kids at home.  I'm, like, there's no sense in even trying to work.
R:  No.  Day care is impossible.
L:  Yeah, 'cause they would all three have to be at -- well, the two youngest would have to be in full time day care.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm like, I wouldn't even be making anything.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, that's what my husband and I discussed it, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- next year, all of them but two will be in school full time --
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  -- and the one will be in school for half a day, and here, you have to pay for a full day day care, regardless if the child's there for a half day or not.
L:  Yep.  That's how most of them are here, too.
R:  Yeah.  And --
L:  And we have to pay if they're sick.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  Or um like -- like yesterday [MN] for Memorial Day, I had to pay for three kids to be in there, and they weren't even open.
R:  Oh, my.
L:  Yep.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, paid vacations?
L:  Yep.  They get paid vacations.  [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.  How does that -- it's unbelievable --
L:  Yep, 'cause they're like -- they say, "Well, we're just like any other business" you know, and if you had a job somewhere, you'd get a paid vacation.
R:  Yeah, that's what they say.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  And my husband's, like, this is ridiculous.  He said, "You should open one and get a paid vacation".
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  It's --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- just impossible almost.  [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.  Yes, it is.  Very much.
R:  You married?
L:  Um, yep.
R:  Happily?
L:  Yep.
R:  Yes.  That's good.
L:  We've been together since high school and I'm thirty seven now.  [LAUGH].
R:  Well, my husband and I, we were boy and girl next door.
L:  Oh, really?  
R:  Yes.
L:  So you grew up together?
R:  We grew up together --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and we ended up buying a house that -- they built a development in the woods that we used to play in --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and uh so we bought a house up in the development where we used [LAUGH] to play when we were kids.
L:  Huh.
R:  And our families, they live two doors from each other.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, wow. 
R:  So it's -- it's really funny.  He's four years younger than me, so [LAUGH] --
L:  Went to school and everything together?
R:  We went to school and -- and then uh, he moved away for a little while and we broke up and --
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  -- then he came back and we got back together and --
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].  So we're very happily married and --
L:  True love.
R:  Yeah, true love.  Believe it or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- not, it's out there.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yep.  [LAUGH].  Huh.  So --
R:  So do your --
L:  -- you were born and raised there, then?
R:  Yes.  Born --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- and raised.
L:  Yep, yep.
R:  It's -- sometimes it depressing but [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  The area that we're in is just -- there's uh not a whole lot of culture around here.
L:  Yeah.  That's -- well, where we -- we're right in the middle.  We can go Detroit, Kalamazoo and [inaudible].  We're right in the centre of everything.
R:  I've been to Detroit and Kalamazoo. 
L:  Yep, but to go to them, you know, it's gonna take you an hour.  
R:  Oh.
L:  But we're right in the centre of everything, so I mean, if we decide to go somewhere, we got a pretty good choice of where to go.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Just gotta make that drive.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's pretty much with us.  It's about forty five minutes between --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- Baltimore and Philly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So it -- but the people around here really don't go to places like that.  [LAUGH].
L:  Really?  
R:  I don't -- my -- my parents, they used to take us travelling all the time when we were children --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so we have a taste of the world, I guess you would say and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- a lot of people around here don't -- they -- they joke in the neighboring cities that, you know, the people around here hardly have any teeth.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  That's -- oh, it's bad sometimes.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  But then geographically it's great, in between everything and --
L:  Right.  
R:  -- so I happen to like --
