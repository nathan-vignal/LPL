L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Yes?  Hi, --
R:  Hi.
L:  I'm Lina.
R:  I'm Jamie.
L:  Hi, Jamie.
R:  Hi.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Um, the person that really is supposed to be doing this is not here, so I'm going to do this for 'em, okay?
L:  Okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Just deal with me.  I don't know how to do this.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, this is my second time, so, ah, and I guess they said, ah, the topic is censorship?
R:  Yeah, in -- something about --
L:  Books --
R:  Books, something in school, and what they -- if, ah, kids are supposed to read, in, like, in different schools, different -- the same books or whatever, something like that -- like, certain types of books.  [PAUSE] Yeah, something like that.
L:  Is that about whether the schools should be telling students what to read, or --
R:  Yeah, something like that.
L:  Yeah, is that how I understood it?
R:  Yeah, I think so.
L:  Okay.
R:  Right.
L:  So, what do you think, Jamie?  [LAUGH]
R:  I think that they should be allowed to read whatever they want to.  I [MN] think it's just a free -- right -- law, so --
L:  Yeah, I'm not sure.  It's been a while since I was at school; so, I'm not even sure --
R:  Well, see, --
L:  -- what they are reading --
R:  -- I'm in school [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH] so, I don't know, maybe it depends on the grades.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, so, um, -- does your school allow to -- you know, do they have that censorship as far as books concerned?
R:  Um, not really except for, like, -- yeah, no, actually, I don't think about it, you can read pretty much whatever you want.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But it goes back to where you can't -- the teachers can't read the Bibles in school, and stuff like that.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, you --
L:  I didn't know that.
R:  -- can't, they can't do that, and stuff, so --
L:  Mhm.  Do they tell you what to read?
R:  Mm, no, they -- unless you have, like, assigned book, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for a grade, or something, then you can, but -- we have the library, of course, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- where you can go in there and pick whatever book you want, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and read it for points, or, something [MN] --
L:  Oh, o- --
R:  -- like that.
L:  Okay.
R:  [MN]
L:  Do they have a list of recommended books?  For your grade, that you have to read?
R:  Mm, no.
L:  No?  
R:  No.  You have to read, like, we have AR books, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and those are our points, and you have to read, like, one of them and pass it to pass, um, that part of your grade, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so --
L:  Mhm.  Well, um, I don't know exactly what they expect us to talk about --
R:  [MN] Yeah [MN] --
L:  -- on this topic, [LAUGH]
R:  -- yeah, I know, I don't even know what the -- the first word me- -- word meant.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so -- so, where, ah -- where are you from?
L:  I'm from Ukraine, originally, and --
R:  Okay, cool.
L:  -- I, yeah.  Ah, [LAUGH] so, I did my graduate studies here, but I never went to high school here, or any school, actually.  That's why I'm not quite clear on how it works in general; [SIGH] --
R:  Well, see, my mom is the one that's supposed to actually be doing this.  [LAUGH] --
L:  [SIGH] Right.  --
R:  -- but she's taken my little sister somewhere, so --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] yeah.
R:  Yeah, I live in Alabama.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm in Boston.
R:  Boston?  Cool.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [MN] What's it like down there?
L:  What's that?
R:  What's it, ah, what's it like down there?
L:  Oh, it's great.  Have you been?
R:  No.
L:  -- to Boston?
R:  No.
L:  I think it's one of the best cities to visit, so, if you have an opportunity, um, out of all the cities in the United States, I think it's one of the, --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you know, nicest to come as a tourist because you can walk, and, um, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, you don't really need a car to go --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- to the museums and stuff, so --
R:  Well, people down here think you need to passport to get down here.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] like, it- it's really nice down here, and stuff.
L:  Yeah, how's the weather in Alabama?
R:  Uh, it's really pretty, --
L:  Really?
R:  Actually, -- yeah, it's just the perfect temperature and everything.  
L:  Ah.
R:  It's like [inaudible] --
L:  Because it's been raining for three days here, non stop.
R:  Yeah, it's been here too, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it stopped, though, it stopped yesterday.
L:  Mm, yeah, the whole Memorial Day weekend has been, just, --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- wet.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I don't know, let's -- I don't know whether we should talk about [MN] censorship, um, we have a few more minutes, I guess -- um, so, do you think that --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- there are some certain topics that schools should advise the students against?
R:  Against?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, um, not really.  I -- I think you should be allowed to do whatever --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I have people all at my house, -- [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- they're laughing over something.  I'm scared to know why. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So, um, do you think, like, if, um, -- do you think that some books may be too early for people to read, like, um, at a certain age?
R:  That they shouldn't read it 'cause of their age?
L:  Right.
R:  Mm, if they can read it and understand it, and -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- not make big deals over it, or something like that -- yeah.  I think so.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Say, like, me, I've already read Gone with the Wind and all that stuff and I'm only in eighth grade.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I read it in sixth.
L:  Oh, really? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So --
L:  Um, also, I wanted to ask something -- oh, --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- we're supposed to talk about books, right?
R:  Yeah, I think so.
L:  How about movies?  We don't have to talk about movies, because movies have those ratings, like, PG, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- thirteen, whatever, but books don't, --
R:  Yeah, I know, it's --
L:  -- yeah, I wonder if that's something they want us to bring up, in this conversation.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] yeah, that could be a, -- well, I don't see why not.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I -- I don't think you should, like, I think you could read whatever book you wanted to and not have to worry about it, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but the movies, it's a different story right there.  [LAUGH] It's -- is -- I think, yeah, the movies need to stay rated and stuff like that, because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, if it's R, you go, and you find out why.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah, I -- I agree on th- -- I mean, probably, schools should be happy if people read whatever, I mean, because most schoolchildren probably are not into reading at all, right?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Um, --
R:  -- I mean, --
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- if you -- I think they should have a list of certain books you should read.
L:  Right, at least -- something recommended.
R:  Yeah, and that'll get more people reading, --
L:  Mhm. Mhm.
R:  And stuff like that.  See, I read anyways, [MN] I read mysteries, and, like, Earl Starr -- you ever heard of him?
L:  Mm, what's that?  Say again?
R:  Hm?
L:  What -- who is -- could you repeat that?
R:  Earl Starr?
L:  No, --
R:  No, he's -- 
L:  -- no.
R:  -- he, ah, does, like, the horror mysteries.
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  -- [MN] the really good ones, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he's got -- I like them because they're really interesting and they all have the ending, you know?
L:  Yeah, I guess I don't read enough these days, either.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But that's another thing, like, should they encourage the students to be reading the classics, World Classics, or anything -- maybe --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I mean, that's another issue on that topic.  
R:  [LAUGH] Do you have, um, a favorite book?
L:  Me?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, um, I like short stories.
R:  Short stories?
L:  Yeah, like John Updike, and --
R:  [LAUGH] I never heard of that so --
L:  No?
R:  No.
L:  Yeah, that's more like American classics.  Actually, he's still alive, --
R:  Mm?
L:  -- and, um, Salinger -- have you heard of Salinger?
R:  Yeah, I've heard of him.
L:  -- Catcher in the Rye, you know, that kind of, you know, -- and that was a good book about -- what was that -- Memoirs of a Geisha.
R:  I never heard of that.  
L:  Have you -- no?
R:  No.
L:  Yeah, see, it -- ah, it- it's different for different ages, too, so, um, -- I just don't know, they asked us to talk about it, but you know, how can you really, um, you know, tell students not to read -- unless they catch you with a book, you know, there is no way they can really control that situation, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I don't know.
R:  Ah, I think it's -- I think you should be able to read whatever. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's your choice.
L:  Right! because if you're not interested, you can just quit, probably, and --
R:  Yeah, and it's, like, okay, if it's --
L:  -- stop reading that book.
R:  -- boring, if you read the first couple of chapters, you find out if it's boring or not, if you don't like it, or --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, or --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- if it's boring, or, -- you know, put it aside, and maybe come back to it in a couple of years, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because at different ages, people --
R:  Yeah, it could be, could be your, --
L:  -- have different perspectives.
R:  -- could -- because of your age, you don't actually --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- find that interesting, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and so you come back later on and then do it.
L:  Right, yeah -- so, -- I don't know, what else about censorship, and --
R:  I don't really have much more to talk about, -- [LAUGH]
L:  I know! [LAUGH] Me neither.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's -- it's a tough topic, I felt like declining it, but then I figured, you know, --
R:  All right --
L:  -- I already picked up the phone, so, might as well.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, like, this is, um, going to be a really easy topic, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- um, it's not.
