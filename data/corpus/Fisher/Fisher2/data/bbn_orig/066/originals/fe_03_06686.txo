L:  Hi, my name is Nicole.
R:  Hi, I'm Larry.
L:  Hi.  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- where are you calling from?
R:  [NOISE] Uh, southern California.
L:  Oh, that's where I am, too. [LAUGH]
R:  Is it?
L:  Yup.
R:  Great.
L:  [SIGH] Um, so, um --
R:  Well then, you probably exercise more --
L:  Yeah, the --
R:  -- like, uh -- like your neighbors, like the rest of the community --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- not just -- yeah, that's the way it is for me, too, although I swam -- I'm a swimmer and I've been swimming all my life since I was a Boy Scout but I do it more so now because you just look at your neighbors [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they -- they're always so fit, you have to do something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  At least that's the way I -- I look at it.
L:  Do you swim in the ocean or in a pool?
R:  I swim in the ocean, you know, a couple of times a year.  Um, I live in Santa Monica and all of the beach have gotten haze here so it's -- it's pretty lucky, except, you know, right after rain [COUGH] but, uh, I usually swim in a pool, you know, year round.  I couldn't even start to swim in the ocean this weekend, it's still too cold.
L:  Oh yeah, definitely. [LAUGH] I'm actually in Los Angeles also, so, um, yeah, I'm in the Silver Lake area.
R:  Really?
L:  Yep.
R:  Not a --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- big lake for swimming, Silver Lake. [LAUGH]
L:  No, [LAUGH] no, it's a reservoir so ... [LAUGH]
R:  No, I know, I used to, uh -- I used to live in, um [LIPSMACK] what's called Franklin Hills but, uh --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- it's, um -- it's nice in Silver Lake.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Would be nice if [MN] --
L:  It's gets hotter here though than it does in Santa Monica.  You have it nice.
R:  Definitely, definitely.
L:  Today it's roasting here, so ...
R:  Is it really?
L:  Mhm, yep.
R:  'Cause I'm right in the coastal district and it, uh, is very cloudy and it hasn't rained for us at all.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Lucky. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] [COUGH] Well, it does make it kind of, you know, part of being here and wanting to go outs- -- and -- and wanting to exercise is exercising outside.  So when it's, like, overcast and miserable or, like where you are, when it's so hot you almost don't feel like doing anything.
L:  Exactly.  That's usually when I fall off my routine, in the summertime.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because it's like so -- I go to a gym and it's just so hot just getting there and then -- then in the classes, out -- uh, the air conditioning isn't strong enough and it's -- it's -- that's when I fall off my routine.  It's not in the wintertime so --
R:  No, I imagine.
L:  In the wintertime I'm good. [LAUGH]
R:  I imagine it's easier to stay on a -- an exercise kind of routine.  Swimming in the winter, it's kind of hard for me, even if it is indoors and even if it is nice because you end up coming out and it's going to be a different temperature than when I went in.
L:  Oh true, exactly.
R:  So, it's no fun getting out and it being, like, fifty degrees. [COUGH]
L:  No, that's miserable and especially in the rainy weather, that's horrible.
R:  Yeah, and it was rainy this year.
L:  Yeah, little --
R:  There were plenty --
L:  Little bit, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Plenty of times that I would have, uh, gone to go swimming ex- -- except for the rain, you know, it --
L:  Yeah.  I, um -- I belong to a gym and I take their classes.  Like, I take step and, um, weight classes there and so I take -- like, I go, like, three to four times a week and do it an hour each time and it's good and healthy and I've gotten myself into amazing shape and so --
R:  That's great.
L:  -- I like that.  It makes me feel better, you know.
R:  I'm impressed.
L:  It's not only like the way people look in southern California, it's just it makes you more energetic and just feel more alive.
R:  Well, I'm afraid I'm a little shallow on that part.  I -- I know that it has great benefits but somehow I'm more [SIGH] interested in what it does for the way you look.
L:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  I know -- I know [LAUGH] -- I know it makes you younger and it keeps your heart healthy, etcetera but [NOISE] it just makes you look better, too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that's the thing that everybody sees, [NOISE] I think that's what everybody sees right away.
L:  It's true, it's true.
R:  [MN]
L:  And having muscles and -- and it's -- it's really ironic because I was raised back east and when I go back east everyone looks, like, heavier, everything -- everything is heavier, bigger, people are bigger and it's really interesting because I'm, you know, coming back here, you know, people are skinny and nice and -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I -- I tell ya, I got friends in Hollywood who say that it's not just back east, it's just back east of the four oh five, sometimes.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They feel -- they feel like the people who live out in the westside look better than the -- you know, healthier than --
L:  Maybe.
R:  -- people on the eastside.  Oh, I don't [inaudible] that.  I think that, you know, it's a -- a matter of lifestyle.  I think a lot of the people I know in Hollywood go out to bars at night and -- and that's what their life is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They couldn't possibly get up at sunrise and --
L:  True, that's true.
R:  -- got out and exercise and -- and it took me a long time to get out of that east coast, uh, mentality of, you know, late to bed and late to rise makes you have the most fun. [LAUGH]
L:  Yep.  Yes, exactly.
R:  And [COUGH] finally it did sink in and I do go to bed earlier and I do get up earlier and I do fill my day with a lot more, um, if not exercise, activity.
L:  Yep.
R:  Just plain activity.  But a real exercise routine is also -- it's what it -- it's exactly what it's cracked up to be.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You do see the benefits and everybody sees the benefits on you.
L:  Yep, exactly.  And -- and it just -- I'm -- I mean, not only -- not only -- only looking better but, I mean, it's just I can't -- I can't believe, like, so many of the other benefits, I started noticing.  I've been -- I've been really on a strong routine for the last five years so it's -- and before that I -- I didn't really -- I -- I didn't really have any muscle definition.  I was always skinny but I never had any, like, muscle definition and now, working out, I can't even imagine, you know, going without it.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I feel stronger and healthier --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it's good to feel strong.
R:  Oh, it's -- it's a wonderful feeling that you get from it and I know what it does to me to not exercise for three months or something.  I get -- I get real cranky and hard --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to deal with.  My employees also say, you know, "You -- you really need to go swimming or get some exercise.  You're awfully mean these days". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, exactly. [LAUGH] Need some endorphins. [LAUGH]
R:  That's -- yeah, I guess that's what they're telling me.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  That it makes me a nicer person to be around, too.
L:  Yep, it's true.  And so you grew up back east, too?
R:  In Chicago.
L:  Oh, okay, yeah, I'm -- I grew up in Buffalo so the climates are very similar.
R:  Yeah, they're very very similar and even though I have, uh, never been there I know some -- I know e- -- enough people from there that I've started to watch what the weather's like there and it's very similar with the snow, the lake effect of the snow in Buffalo, you know --
L:  Yep. [LAUGH]
R:  -- six feet of snow one day.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, exactly.
R:  That's exercise --
L:  Exactly, and the wind.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's the thing, too. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well and the wind on Lake Michigan, it, uh --
L:  Oh, definitely.
R:  -- is pretty severe and very, you know -- comes from, seems like from the North Pole right to your face. [SIGH]
L:  Exactly.  Yeah, I have friends from --
R:  But that's exercise, too, I was thinking.  When you're in --
L:  Mm?
R:  [COUGH] In, uh, Buffalo or Chicago, that snow, just walking through it is extra exercise.
L:  That's true. [LAUGH]
R:  I used to have to walk to high school, so --
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  -- I exercised plenty.
L:  I tell people out here about how when -- when it was snowing and nobody had shoveled out, how you had to find other people's foot holes and [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- stand in them in the snow.
R:  I forgot about that, yeah.  You did.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] And so that was like exercise, that's like step class, right?
R:  It sure is.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Didn't think of that.  Of course it is.
L:  [LAUGH] And wearing all that ex- -- all the extra coats and +scarves.  That's, like, twenty extra pounds.
R:  That's extra weight and you have to carry that around outside --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and get overheated before you even get out to exercise so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And --
L:  But it's -- it's so true that most people that I know back there don't exercise at all, they just don't.
R:  Yeah, I've --
L:  It's like --
R:  I, uh -- I wonder what that is.
L:  I don't know.  Is it -- maybe it's just out here because of the, you know -- the industry, the acting industry, movie industry, everything like that.  It's just a whole different thing.  And plus we walk around in sleeveless shirts all the time and, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we show our bodies more.
R:  Exactly.  You want to, um [NOISE] be able to [NOISE] look like the competition, so to speak, even though I -- I'm not an actor but I have actors all around me, just like you, just like everybody who lives out here --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- so you do kinda want to look as good as them. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, definitely, and it -- and it --
R:  And they certainly have the time to exercise, too, if they're not working.
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true.  It really, um, it -- it -- and it's really minimal effort that you really have to put on -- out, um, to get so much back and that's the thing.  I mean, you know --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- working out a few times a week really really can make a difference.
R:  It does make a difference.  I guess that's what people in the east aren't getting because I, uh, tell people when they want to start exercising that, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you really just have to do it for three months, give yourself ninety days, fully knowing that in three weeks they'll see results.
L:  Oh, definitely.
R:  But if they've got it in their head that it's going to take three months, then maybe they won't be turned off in three weeks, maybe they'll -- they'll put up with it.  But if they expect results tomorrow, then they'll fall off --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- in two weeks they'll quit.
