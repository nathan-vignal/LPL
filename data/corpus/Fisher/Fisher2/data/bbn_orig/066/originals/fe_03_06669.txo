L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  
R:  Hi.
L:  My name is Randi.  [LAUGH].
R:  My name is Rhema.
L:  I'm -- I'm -- I'm sorry?
R:  Rhema.
L:  Rhema? 
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay.  Nice to meet you.
R:  Same here.
L:  Um, health and fitness.  Do you exercise regularly?
R:  Yes.  
L:  So do I.
R:  Yeah, I walk on the treadmill about a hour a day.
L:  I walk outside.  I have to wait till my husband gets home around eleven o'clock at night and when my kids are sleeping so I can go by myself and have free -- you know, it's my only free time.  I take my dog with me.  And --
R:  Well, it's -- it's -- the weather here is not all that good for me to be walking outside yet.
L:  Really? Where are you at?
R:  I'm from Michigan.
L:  Michigan.  I'm in Pennsylvania.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  So I'm on the other side of the State.
R:  Yeah.  It's usually -- it's either cold or it's not, 'cause it's --
L:  I mean --
R:  -- either warm and rainy.
L:  Yeah.  It's getting pretty nice here now.  See, when it was winter, I didn't go outside.  I just -- you know, did like pilates.
R:  Yeah.
L:  To videos.
R:  I just ordered that.
L:  The -- uh, the winter pilates?
R:  Yes.  
L:  So did I.
R:  I didn't get it yet though.
L:  Oh, really?  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Um, yeah.  I've been trying off and on.  I have two children and after I had the two girls, I gained a lot of weight and then I was like desperately, you know, trying to lose it.  It was really hard.
R:  Well, I just had a baby four months ago.
L:  Did you?
R:  Yeah, I had a baby girl.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah, so um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I just stopped breastfeeding so I've been trying to lose my weight now.
L:  I breastfed too, both of them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, my first daughter, I breastfed her which is good -- very good for their health, beings that we're talking about health and fitness, not unless that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- goes with that.  [LAUGH].  But I breastfed my second daughter for a whole year.  She -- she would not take a bottle whatsoever.
R:  Wow.
L:  So she was latched onto me for a whole year.  She -- I -- I tried to give her a bottle.  She didn't know how to take it, nothing.  So and they say you're supposed to lose weight by breastfeeding, which is -- it didn't work for me.  [LAUGH].
R:  No.  She -- I breastfed for -- till she was three months and then she got sick.
L:  Really?
R:  And she didn't know how to latch on any more, it was hard for her to breathe.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I remember.  So health.
R:  Are you -- do -- have you been doing the winter pilate tape?
L:  Yes.
R:  Do you like it?
L:  Not every day.  Yeah, it's -- it's a good -- I got the five tape set.  
R:  The five? I got the -- I think the basic.
L:  Yeah, I think that's three of them.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I ordered the five tapes.  I haven't got to uh the last two yet though, 'cause I have the girls and it's really hard to get time when I can do it when they're sleeping and I can lay on the floor because they're on top of me.  If I lay on the floor, they want to do it with me and [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's hard.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I try to eat good, but you know, sometimes we'll make a cake or cookies.
R:  And when they're there, you can't help but eat it.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's why I don't buy any of that stuff any more.
L:  That's my -- you know what?  I -- we used to buy [inaudible], see.  Their dad, he loves [inaudible] you know?  He drinks Pepsi.  I don't drink pop.  You know, I'll have maybe ginger ale or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- Sprite every so often.  But he drinks Pepsi like crazy, every day.  And I know that it's bad [NOISE] bad, bad, bad.  Sorry, my daughter's interrupting me.
R:  That's okay.
L:  Um, I try to feed us, you know, all healthy food.  It's really hard because he's very picky.  He will not eat -- the only thing green he will eat is green beans and peas.  That's about it.  He won't eat broccoli --
R:  Oh, I don't like vegetables.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  So, I try to get him to take vitamins, which is hard.  You know, 'cause --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- he forgets and I -- I take vitamins almost every day.  Once in a while I'll forget, and I get the girls to take their vitamins, too.  'Cause if they don't eat, you know, the right foods, they're not going to get the right nutrition.
R:  That's true.
L:  So I try to make everybody healthy.  I always watch the Infomercials and um everything.  I try.  I'm not perfect.
R:  Yeah.  No one is.
L:  You know, we have junk food and --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  But we -- I try to make up for it.  [LAUGH].  For what we do that's wrong.
R:  No, my husband gained a lot of weight when I was pregnant also.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, but I think he's noticing it, so now he's starting to watch what he eats.  He doesn't eat past seven and he's starting to walk on the treadmill and play basketball every day.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Just so he can lose his weight.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I'm size five and I am a hundred and fifty pounds.  Off and on.  One forty five to one fifty.  I'm like stuck.  I've been stuck here for a year now.  I cannot get past this weight.  And I don't know why.
R:  It's hard.  
L:  It is.  I'm at this -- after my uh second child, after her birth, I was stuck -- I -- I weighed a hundred and seventy five pounds.  I went to two hundred and ten pounds when -- the day before I delivered, with both of them I was the same weight.  Then after I had them, I was a hundred and seventy five pounds and now I'm like, you know, between one forty five and one fifty.  That's still really good --
R:  Yeah.  Well, I'm, what, five four and right now I weigh about one thirty.
L:  Oh, you're better than me.  [LAUGH].
R:  I got some more pounds and I'll be my -- back to my normal weight.
L:  Yeah.  Uh, my mom's really heavy.  She doesn't eat right at all, though.
R:  So is mine.  
L:  Really?
R:  Yes.  She munches a lot.
L:  Mhm.  Sugar.  My mom has diabetes.
R:  Oh.
L:  And that's why I'm afraid, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it runs in the family.  [NOISE].  What, baby?  Good girl.  Sorry.  
R:  It's okay.  How old are your daughters?
L:  Shannon is four, she turned four in January, and Lauren will be three next month.
R:  Oh, so you had them right after each other?
L:  Back to back.  I -- you know, when you're breastfeeding, you don't get your period all -- or some people -- some people don't get their period back until the six months, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- after you have the baby, and then you start your cycle again and that is when I got pregnant.  Soon as I -- sorry, that's another one, but I can't answer that.  I got pregnant right after that with Lauren.
R:  I know.  I [inaudible] birth control when I was breastfeeding.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  I wanted to be safe.
L:  I didn't.  See?  I -- I wa -- I thought I was gonna be so safe.  Now I'm really, really careful, 'cause these two are wild.  Two little girls.  They're just wild.  I love them, though.  They're a lot of fun.  They keep me going.  
R:  Yeah.  Mine right now, I just got -- started her with solids.  
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  So it's a really big mess.
L:  Lauren loved solid.  But her sister won't touch it.  Neither will her dad.  Lauren eats like me, and Shannon eats like her dad.
R:  Oh, I see.  
L:  He doesn't eat very well.  His mother didn't feed him right when he was growing up.  I wa- I -- I was always fed, like, we have different family backgrounds.  
R:  I see.  Mine is starting to do everything pretty early.  Right now she's starting to sit in her walker.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, she's a big baby.
L:  Is she starting to push it around?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Is she three or four months, did you say?
R:  She's four.
L:  Four months.  My two girlfriends are both pregnant now, on their third child.  [LAUGH].  Together.  I was pregnant with my uh best friend, together with her, too, and now -- well, there's like three best friends, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I was pregnant with the one, now they're pregnant together.  It's weird.  So I'm like, stay away from me.   Just --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  'Cause the one got pregnant and then the other one got pregnant, and they're always joking around. "Oh, it's those pregnant cuties", I'm like, whoa, staying away.  
R:  Yeah.  I don't want -- I said I'll wait till she turns three, I'll start trying again.
L:  Mhm.  It's nice for them to have someone to play with.  
R:  Yeah, but I got a big family so there's always -- there's always kids around.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  And my neighbors kids all --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't think it's a problem.  Got a really big family.  
L:  No.  Sorry.
R:  So, what is -- what is your ideal weight that you wanna reach?
L:  My -- my ideal weight?  Oh, one thirty would be great.
R:  One thirty?  
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I've five -- five five, about five five, last time I checked, um, that seems like a pretty good -- it's not too --
R:  Do you --
L:  -- thin.
R:  Me, what I do is, I don't go by weight.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, because I -- I don't -- 'cause you could put a couple people that all weigh the same by -- and everyone looks different.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, so I go by the weight I like what I see.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.   I don't go by weight.
L:  It's like I can't get past this plateau.  I -- I mean, I'm pretty strong.  I know muscle weighs more than fat does, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm really strong.  I do a lot of hard work, lifting and moving stuff.  Um --
