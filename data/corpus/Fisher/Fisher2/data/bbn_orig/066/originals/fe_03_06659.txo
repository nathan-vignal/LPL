L:  Hi, I'm Cindy.
R:  Hi, I'm Meredith.
L:  How are you?
R:  Good.  How are you?
L:  I'm good.  
R:  Good.
L:  Not exercising like I should be.
R:  No?  [LAUGH].
L:  No.  Are you into fitness?
R:  You know, I'm not, and the bad thing is I signed up for a gym about two months ago and I think I've gone four times.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Well, I had ordered that, um, Beach Body, the Power Ninety, and I got it and I had it for about a week and I looked at it on ebay.
R:  What is that?
L:  It's a set of workout tapes.  There's like six of them, and then you can purchase, like, the elastic band.
R:  Oh.
L:  And the first two videos were, like, more like warm ups.  The second two were okay, and the third two were just extremely hard.  Like, more for like abdominal stuff.
R:  Oh.  
L:  Yeah, and I mean, I'm not that much into fitness.
R:  Yeah, me either.  I tried one of those abdominal tapes that said, you know, oh yeah, if you do the tape three times a week --
L:  Right.  [LAUGH].
R:  -- you -- you're gonna have abs of steel and I tried it and I could barely move for the next day.
L:  Wow.
R:  After the first time.  I never did it again.  [LAUGH].
L:  I know, and I was uh -- you know, a couple years back, I had um when Richard Simmons had first came out, the sweating to the oldies --
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  Um, it was more like dance -- you know, more like a dance workout?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that was all right, and I actually lost some --
R:  But that sounds fun.
L:  -- weight.  It was.  
R:  That sounds really fun.
L:  Yeah, I did it with my sister in law.  We actually -- I mean, you do lose weight.
R:  Yes.
L:  You know, but you have to be consistent with it and I'm not.  Even now I'm not as consistent as I should be.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I prefer walking over anything else.
R:  Well, that's great, too.  I wish I could -- I wa- I used to walk a lot and I live in Arizona --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and now it's so hot out that every time I think of going for a walk, it's just unbearable.
L:  Yeah.  I live in Pennsylvania.  We have some pretty calm weather.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Right now anyway.  
R:  How nice.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  So do you believe in eating healthy when you're exercising, or do you -- are you one of these that thinks, you know -- I don't know.  
L:  I try.  
R:  Do you?
L:  Yeah.  I try -- well, not always, but I try to at least, you know, eat a few healthy things, like, each day and it -- you know, if I make something for supper, I at least try to make, um, you know, like a salad or something.
R:  Yeah.  See --
L:  But --
R:  -- I'm like that, too, but I've tried these crash diets, because even though I know that they're not going to work because as soon as I'm done, I'm going to gain the weight back that I've lost --
L:  Right.  
R:  -- I can't -- every time I see one, I feel like, "Oh, I can do that.  I'll try it" and I can't seem to convince myself not to do it.
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  I don't know why I put myself through it.
L:  Yeah, but so usually if -- I haven't really ever tried the -- the crash diet thing.
R:  Oh.
L:  I've never -- I've never tried that.
R:  But see --
L:  'Cause I just fig-
R:  -- I did Atkins[?] for a while.
L:  Well, I just figured once you start eating again, you're going to put it back on anyway.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you know, you can't always watch what you eat, forever.
R:  I know.  
L:  So I just -- I never really attempted it.  
R:  See, I di- I tried the Atkins and I lost weight and it was great, but after six months, I had gained all of it back.
L:  Which diet was that?
R:  The Atkins diet.
L:  Oh.  
R:  That where you eat lots of meat and cheese and no bread or flour, no carbohydrates.
L:  Oh, that's my weakness.
R:  Pure protein, and I love carbohydrates.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So that didn't work very well, once I went off of it.
L:  Yeah.  A friend of mine, she had went on, um, the -- she heard it from Oprah, where they went on, like, a liquid diet.  She got really, really sick because all she would do was drink.
R:  Oh.
L:  And, you know, it -- she drank all the -- and I was telling her all the time, you need to eat, you know, even if it's salads and you know, fruit, you -- you need to eat.
R:  Yeah.
L:  She got really, really sick from doing that.
R:  Oh, that's off of Oprah?  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I can't believe that she would do that.
L:  Yeah.  Well, they say that when Oprah lost her weight, she did it with iced tea and water.
R:  How boring.
L:  I know.  
R:  See, I like to --
L:  You had to be --
R:  -- cook too much.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I couldn't --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I couldn't [LAUGH] do that.
L:  She had to be starving.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I would -- I would have been starving.
R:  Oh, that's horrible.
L:  Yeah.  Definitely crazy.  
R:  Mm.
L:  There's a lot of other ways to lose weight, besides doing stuff like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they say that if you lose weight slowly, it's better.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I've heard -- I've had a lot of friends and people at work that have gone on the Weight Watchers Points.
L:  Mhm?
R:  And they say in that program that you're supposed to lose two pounds a week in order to keep it off.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they love it because they can eat -- one of my girlfriends, as soon as she had her baby, she went on it and she said, "You know, I know that if I want a Snickers bar and a Coke for lunch, I can have it, but I know that that night, I have to eat" whatever it was, however many points, I don't know.
L:  Right.
R:  But she said, "And I know I can do it and not feel guilty", and so she loves it.  She lost a ton of weight doing that after she had her baby.
L:  Wow. 
R:  So --
L:  That's when I put on my weight, after having my kids.
R:  Did you?
L:  Yeah, and I never -- I never quite lost all of it, from having -- well, I did after my first one, but then after the second one, I never -- well, I didn't exercise as much.  Well see, your first one, it's more of a goal, I think.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  To try and get back down, but with your second one, when do you have time?  
R:  Mm?
L:  When would you have time to do it after one -- two little kids?
R:  I know.  After you have two children --
L:  It's impossible.
R:  -- I can't imagine having time.
L:  Right, and now -- my kids are older now, so now I have the time, you know, I know as I'm just out of sync with it now.
R:  Yeah.  By the second -- I only have one right now and I just can't find the time between work and him to be able to go to the gym I just signed up for.
L:  Right.  
R:  And it's so easy.  I signed up for Curves, I don't know if you've heard of it?
L:  No.  
R:  It's a thirty minute workout and from when you go in the door and out the door, it's thirty minutes and it's a circuit of, um, hydraulic machines and they're really easy and they play really loud fun music and you just go around three times and you're done and it's completely a full body workout.  
L:  Wow.
R:  And it's -- I love it when I go, it's fun, it's easy, it's quick, but I still can't even make thirty minutes --
L:  Right, see --
R:  -- to go between -- by the time my husband gets home to watch him so that I can leave and then come home, I just can't do it.
L:  Right.  Yeah, it's hard.
R:  So --
L:  But do you feel better when you go to the gym?
R:  I do.  I feel much better.  I've --
L:  Yeah, I've -- I've never joined a gym yet.
R:  See, I -- I had joined other gyms that were more of the gym type where you see all the little, tiny, skinny girls and --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
R:  -- the big, huge, buff guys.
L:  We have a lot of those around here.  [LAUGH].
R:  And I didn't have any desire to be there, because I felt completely uncomfortable.
L:  Right.  
R:  And because that's --
L:  I think that's my problem.
R:  Yeah.  I would go in a baggy T shirt and shorts and I did not look like any of the other people there.
L:  Right.  Yeah, that's how it is around --
R:  But this place --
L:  -- here.  Everybody that goes in the gym is a stick.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, what are they going there for?
R:  Yeah.  I can imagine up there.  
L:  Yeah, I would never want to do that.
R:  Well, at this place, that's why I like it, it's all women, and the first time I went, there were people who were sixty years old and people who were probably sixteen.
L:  Wow.
R:  And then all in between, different sizes, everything, and nobody -- it was very comfortable.  It just -- it didn't feel like you had this pressure to prove a point or --
L:  Weren't being judged.
R:  Exactly.  
L:  Yeah, that -- unfortunately, that happens a lot.
R:  Yes.
L:  Too much.
R:  It does.
L:  I know my daughter, she's -- she's not even quite overweight yet, I mean, she's thirteen --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and she's like a little chunky, but she's like -- I mean, she's got so much more growing to do and she's even talking about, you know, at school how she wants to start exercising and doing this and doing that because all the girls at school are so sticks -- you know, thin, and I said to her, you don't want to be like that.  When you're thin like that, you get sick all the time.  You know, I was thin like that before I got married --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- before I had my kids and I -- I'm more healthier now that I have a couple more pounds on me than I was back then.
R:  Yeah.  Well, it's true and that's the sad thing, that a lot of the girls growing up now feel that they have to look a certain way in order to be pretty and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- popular and --
L:  Right, and I like -- I mean, I told my daughter, exercise is good, you know, go for a walk --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, watch a show on TV and you know, do with it dance, you know, do that kind of stuff, but do it because you want to or it makes you feel good, not because you're under pressure at school.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And you know, I think there's the big difference, is she's more pressured by, you know, the other kids at school.  And she's not even, you know, she's not even heavy by any means, and you know, but she's just a tad bit chunkier than the rest of them and she -- you know, she's taken it to heart.
R:  Oh, that's horrible.  
L:  You know.
R:  Does she do any sports or any activities that she really likes or --
L:  Oh, she's -- no, no.  She doesn't really want to do much of any sport.
R:  Yes.
L:  You know, that kind of stuff, but she is into, like, roller skating so and I've been telling her, like, that's great, you know.  It's a good way to lose weight.
R:  Yeah, it's great --
L:  To get yourself toned up.
R:  -- exercise.  
L:  So they have it every Wednesday at the skating rink and um it's like to help the needy.  You donate -- like, every week, it's something different.  Like, you donate paper towels or [inaudible] cans or whatever and -- and they distribute it to the needy.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So and then all you pay for is your skate rental so I have her doing that and then she goes, um, usually on a Saturday she'll go.  
R:  How neat.
L:  So, yes.  I mean, she likes going.
R:  That's really good exercise, too.  Really good exercise.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So that's good for her.
L:  Yeah, it -- I think it's just because she only does it, like, that twice a week, she thinks it's not enough.  
R:  Hm
L:  You know, 'cause she goes Wednesdays and on Saturdays.
R:  Gee, if I could do something like that twice a week, I'd be pretty proud of myself.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] that's what I said.  You know, it's a big thing for me to walk down to the mail box and get the mail.
R:  I know.
L:  Well, I have a back injury right now.  I'm a CNA[?] and I had got injured at work --
R:  Oh, no.
L:  -- so I haven't been doing much of anything.  
R:  How'd you hurt yourself?
L:  Um, transferring a resident.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.  She was ready to fall and I -- the other girl, like, had no strength and I grabbed her myself and uh I just --
