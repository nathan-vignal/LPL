R:  Hello!
L:  Hello.
R:  My name is Mercedes.  
L:  Hi, Merced- Mercedes, my name is Mary, how are you?
R:  All right.  How are you doing?
L:  I'm pretty good.  How --
R:  Well, it's a pretty interesting topic. [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, what was the question, I didn't quite understand -- I -- I -- I heard the part of them, having to read particular books in school.
R:  Well, they wanted to know if you think that the school has the right to decide, uh, censorship, to decide, um, what type of books the students, ah, can read.
L:  What types of books they can read?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Hm.  Well, --
R:  That's kind of a tricky question, but, I -- I guess, in some ins- instances, I'd say, I guess it depends what type of material, um, that, you know, that you would have in the library, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or the media room, as they call it now.
L:  Right.  Well, I think the library may be optional, too, that's true, -- but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they said required to read, right?  Isn't that what they said?  I mean I sh- --
R:  I don't know if they said re- re- required, um, --
L:  Maybe I should have had them repeat the question.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- oh, goodness, but, if it's required, irregardless, I would think, to a certain degree, you know, they can't just let them bring anything into schools, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that would be my thoughts of it, I know, we certainly had, when I was in school, we certainly had particular classics that we read, and things like that.  How about you?
R:  Yeah, uh, we did too, and, ah, I mean, you know, you -- uh, the language is so free and lax these days, that, the authors, I mean, you just can't, [MN] I don't know, maybe they should have someone in there to go over the book before they put it in the library, [LAUGH] --
L:  -- right, that's true, that's true, --
R:  You know.
L:  -- 'cause, you know, there is just -- it is amazing some of the things that they do have in the library, --
R:  Mhm, --
L:  -- especially --
R:  -- and they feel like they could get away with just about, you know, writing down and saying, ah, ah, anything, ah, without, without regard to the young minds, um, of the children.
L:  That's right, -- [LAUGH]
R:  So, --
L:  -- unfortunately, that's the way the world is, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- my -- my -- brother brought home a-- a bulletin from church and, it had something to do with along the lines of children, you know, the children following what the parents do, and, --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and how when children didn't follow rules back in Biblical times, uh, repeatedly, you know, that the child was just totally out of hand and could not be controlled, um, they stoned the children to death.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  Yeah, I mean, I guess, it's a part of the Bible. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  But, I mean, I, of course, today, they -- that's different times, needless to say, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but nonetheless, it's just that it's so okay for -- for children to do anything, read anything, be anywhere, you know --
R:  -- and they're so impressionable, ah, these days, you know, ah, looking for someone to follow behind, --
L:  -- right.
R:  -- and to look up to, you know, so, I don't -- you  know, I don't -- like I say, it's a tricky question about that censorship, I -- I guess, maybe, if they could set down some rules or certain format -mat and which way that they could censor the books, where they wouldn't infringe on the publisher's or the author's rights, ah, in a particular way, I mean, you know, it's -- [MN] it's kind of tricky, --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- but yet and still, y- you wouldn't want your kids sitting down reading the sexual acts of this person, or--
L:  Right.
R:  -- cursing, and all this kind of stuff, because kids, they, they -- you know, they pick that stuff up, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know.
L:  Right, I know when I was, ah, -- I -- we -- ah -- one book that I particularly remember that we had to write a report on when I was in school, was The Scarlet Letter.  Um, --
R:  Yeah, I heard a lot about that. 
L:  -- I don't know if, ah, -- what age you are, or anything like that, but I graduated, like, in seventy nine, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I particularly remember that, when I was, like, I guess, a junior, um, it was either a sophomore or a junior, that we had to read that book and -- and write a report on it, it was a required thing, it was not optional, you know, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they do, I think, in high school, now, a lot of times, they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- do you have older children?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do they have particular books or do they get to pick their -- pick and choose their books? [MN]
R:  Well, they basically get to pick their, um, their own books for, right now, ah, she's in, ah, ah, middle school, --
L:  Right, that's how my boy is, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he's going to be in the sixth grade, and -- and [MN] --
R:  So, um, ah, as far as I know, ah, sh- -- what she tells me, she gets the chance to just go and, you know, pick her own -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- material to read, and it seems to be pretty safe, the topics that -- that she's brought home so far.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah, I think they kind of do try to, you know, watch out what is in the libraries, but nonetheless, they still have, -- I mean, you know, just like with religion, there are so many different religions, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, that -- that they probably are obligated to have certain kinds of books on religion in there, you know, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or -- or even sexual preferences --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and things like that, you know, --
R:  So many different topics.
L:  -- it's just, I mean, [inaudible] --
R:  You just have to just be careful with -- with today's youth, because they're -- they're not like, you know, back, back, I think the kids back in the day were a little bit stronger minded, or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, than these kids are now.
L:  Exactly right.
R:  -- and, ah, it's just, ah, I -- so I -- I just really, like I said, it's just a tricky, ah, question, maybe they could just hire a person, a monitor or something, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to go over the books that they get in before they put 'em down for the kids to check out, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know?
L:  Well, I think, to a degree, they definitely have, a, a, a right to censorship, you know, so I don't -- [MN] I guess it depends on their reasoning for it, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but -- I -- I think they have to, because if they don't have certain rules, and lines drawn, you know, then, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- then the schools will be just like the rest of the world and, teachers have enough problems with children in school as it is. [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.  Mm.
L:  So -- 
R:  Yeah, and th- -- you know, the kids'll read that stuff, and -- and some of the stuff, they'll go out, and try to, ah, copy it.
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  I mean, you just can't tell what -- what type of child you're put the material in front -- [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  -- in front of, and what type of home life they have, if their parents, you know, ah, watch them, or, or, at home with them, or working t- parents, or, -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- y- you just can't tell, so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to a degree, yeah, I-I guess they should.
L:  Yeah.  Well, like I said, now, like, with us, where we were told read this book, and write a report on it, -- I mean, it was a good book, I, it was -- it was -- I don't recall that it was a whole lot like the movie of it that I saw, but the movie was, you know, a modernized movie, whereas this is a classic that's been around for quite some time.  So --
R:  Yeah, and back in seventies and sixties you had -- you had more mothers at home with their children, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and they gave, you know, you -- so you spent more, the kids, spent more time, with their, with their parents, ah, especially as far as homework and all this stuff is concerned, but nowadays, sometimes the parents are not just able, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- ah, to be at home, so the kids have no supervision.
L:  Unfortunately, that's true.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I home schooled my children for four years, and, --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- um, they're back in school now, well, my daughter's gone, and she's one of the ones that have been completely influenced, she went from being a child who was basically at home and sheltered, to being a wild child, for the moment, so --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [MN] [LAUGH] --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- it's really difficult, you know, sometimes you over smother them, and you over censor them, and then, when they have those opportunities, then they just go wild with them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, that's more or less what she has done. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Well, it's just that some of this material is kind of raw.  I mean, it's kind of, it's kind of, it's surprising that you -- you wouldn't think that they would even have it in -- in the school.
L:  Well, you know, even like science, for instance, I mean, even in school, [MN] it's what, we came from apes, you know,  Darwin's theory, and all, we came from apes, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we didn't come, we weren't created by God, --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I mean, this is in science and history books, you know, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, it's -- I, I, I wonder how the schools handle situations like that, I don't know if they've gotten to where now they don't teach, you know, that -- that we evolved from apes, or just what they teach, I, I tell you --
R:  I don't know, it -- it may not have no -- it may not have even have to worry about that the way they keep -- they're cutting out these programs now, they may not even have a media room or a library to go to.
L:  You're right.
R:  -- 'cause, ah, I mean, I mean, I've heard, up in New York, where they're dropping, ah, music departments and, taking the art classes and stuff away from the kids --
L:  Is that right?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Hm.  Are you --
R:  Said that they just don't have the money for it, --
L:  What area of the country are you from, are you from up North?
R:  No, I'm down here in Atlanta, Georgia.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I'm, I'm in Georgia, also. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay, [LAUGH] --
L:  I -- I -- I couldn't quite tell, sometimes I can tell, you know, pretty well whether someone is from the upper states or not, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- my husband is actually from New York, I'm born and raised Georgia, but [MN] I met him after he retired, so, I can usually tell, ah, ah, and I, ah, --
R:  Yeah, well, that report--
L:  -- you know, a different dialect --
R:  -- that I heard about, that was up in, I think, Maine, Michigan, up in that area, --
L:  Right.
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I'll tell you that a lot of the larger inner cities where there are lots of people out, lots or tax money, lots of dollars, maybe -- it may be that they're cutting out some of those, and we -- we are like, I don't know how awa- aware of this you are, but we are, like, forty ninth or forty seventh, I mean, Georgia's just terrible for education.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, so, we need dollars down here really bad, --
R:  Yeah, I'm -- I'm aware [LAUGH] --
L:  -- I'm, I'm, I have pursued it, ah, a lot since I've been here, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I've got all kinds of educational material that I have sent here, so -- but I -- I -- I guess, s- so far as the censorship, like I said, I -- I guess, I certainly have to -- legally, they probably have to, for themselves, to a degree.
R:  Yeah.  'Cause it -- it can create lots of problems, 'cause, like I said, the kids is just not as stable minded as, ah, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the, the, as we were back in our days, --
L:  Yeah, they're --
R:  -- you know, --
L:  -- certainly not.
R:  -- it's just a different gen- -- gen- -- ah, generation we're --
L:  Completely.
R:  -- dealing with now.
L:  There's TV and video games --
R:  [MN]
