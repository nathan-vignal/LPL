R:  Hi.  I'm Dean.
L:  Yes, I'm Zeta[?].
R:  Hi, Zeta.  How are you?
L:  I'm doing good.  I'm -- ah, what state are you in?
R:  New York.
L:  Oh.  I'm in Washington State.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  On the west coast.
R:  Mhm.  Second person I got from Washington State. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  Okay.  Yeah, everybody I've talked to has been out east.
R:  Yeah.  I guess it's just coincidence.
L:  Ah, I guess. It's probably dark out there by now, huh?
R:  Um, nighttime, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  It's -- let's see, it's almost six thirty here.
R:  Yeah, well it's nine thirty, so we got you by a couple of hours.
L:  Yep.  So, we're supposed to discuss --
R:  Censorship.
L:  Yeah, in public and private schools and things, huh?
R:  Mhm.  You have kids?
L:  No, mine are grown.
R:  They're grown?  Okay.
L:  My youngest answered the phone.  He's twenty four -- ah, yeah, twenty four years old.  And I in fact am[?] pretty much against censorship, as long as it's not X rated and, you know, real pornography type stuff.  
R:  Right.
L:  I think, you know, like, I grew up reading, ah, just about anything and I think it, you know, benefited me. [PAUSE] 
R:  No, I agree with that.  It's, you know [MN] -- too many people over the years have tried to take out some of the classics 'cause --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they --
L: Like Tom Sawyer and --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L: -- Huckleberry Finn.
R:  Uh-huh, yeah.  Pretty scary, isn't it?
L:  That's the stuff that bothered me.  When I saw that I [MN] -- I can't see anything in there.  Yes, they mention the word nigger --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L: -- but it's -- you know, it's part of history.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?
R:  It's not a good pot[?], but it's pot.
L:  Yeah, it's [MN] -- I'm not saying that I agree with everything, but it was part of history and it needs to be taught.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, like, I work at a school and I wear a shirt that has the Southern flag on it, you know, just because it has chihuahuas on it.  And some of the people give me a hard time 'cause it's the Southern, you know, Confederate flag.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I go, "But that's part of history".  You know, there's nothing wrong with a Confederate flag, you know.  I just wear it 'cause it's got a cute dog on it.
R:  Mhm.  You were born in the south, or no?
L:  Ah, no.  I've lived in -- you know, born and raised in Washington State.
R:  Yeah, mhm.
L:  My -- um, Grandma's relatives came from Arkansas.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But, probably if I'd lived back in the days of the Civil War I would've been with the south --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- not that I'm favoring it, but ...
R:  [several inaudible words] [MN] part of -- you know, censorship doesn't -- it's hard but, you know, there's certain things which, you know, you understand why parents may not want their kids to read about. But --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, I guess, that -- you know, history you gotta be careful of.  But then, the other thing you always gotta be careful of, if you read the Japanese history books they w- -- you know, they were attacked in World War Two. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And if you read the American history books, we won the war of eighteen twelve, which is not true.
L:  Oh yeah, there is -- yeah.  You gotta take it with a grain of salt.
R:  Mm.
L:  The p- -- it's -- anybody who writes a book is going to have an opinion and that's they way they're gonna sway it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they're gonna lean towards that.  But, I think they -- you know, if we have the right to read just about any book we can kind of read, you know, each different type and get a -- our own opinion.
R:  And the other thing at school, you would hope that the teacher is -- you know, would be able to explain the good and the bad.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You don't wanna hide things from the kids.
L:  How old are you?
R:  Me?  I'm forty seven.
L:  Forty -- forty seven?
R:  Forty seven, yeah.
L:  Hey, I'm forty eight.  We're right there in the same age group.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  So, you -- you know, what's -- it's scary, you know, if you try to censor things.  But, then again, some people don't believe things.  There's actually people -- like, I'm in New York, so you hear people talk about how they don't think the holocaust ever happened -- it's all made up.
L:  Yeah, that's true --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know.
R:  It's almost scary some people out there.  But, you know, at least kids, if they get exposed in the right setting, then they'll be able to, you know, make their own opinions.
L:  I think that the youth of today are intelligent enough to know [MN] -- you know, if they read enough they can figure out what's for real and what's not.
R:  But, isn't the problem with the youth of today that they don't read -- they tend to play video games instead of --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- reading?
L:  -- I know, and that's --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and that's one reason I don't wanna censor books because they already -- it's hard enough to get them to read the books.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know?
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  Yeah, computers and games -- it's -- it's kind of scary that -- in the work -- I work in schools.  I do security.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  And there's so many of the kids -- I read some of their -- their work and they don't have very good spelling.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's terrible how bad some of them, you know, spell and use grammer and --
R:  They don't need to spell.  They'll just use spell check.
L:  I guess --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I know.  That's true.  But, it's kind of, you know -- I [MN] -- I like to sit down and read a good book.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I still do.  I don't have much time anymore, but I like to read a book.  And -- and the only type I would not let my kids read would be something X rated.
R:  Mhm.
L:  If it was -- if every other word was cuss words, or talking about sex and --    
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, if -- like, To Kill A Mockingbird.  I think that was a great book, and I know there are schools that try to keep --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that out.
R:  True.  Very true.  It's --
L:  You know --
R:  Yeah.  I mean, these are some of the classics.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, you know, I mean, I guess the two things -- well, certainly sex and the other thing I'd be concerned around kids is, you know, something that popularizes, you know, violence, or drugs actually.  I mean, like, some of the rap songs bother me.
L:  Yeah.  Oh yeah, I agree.  Eminem and stuff and --
R:  Mhm.  And I just don't understand the violence -- the nastiness.  That's not something you ought to teach your kids.
L:  I would agree there.  The violence kind of worries me.  You -- you know, that's where -- when you follow up on all these school shooting and stuff, and you find out they either read or they did computer games or listened to music that was really violent.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And --
R:  And the one thing -- like, I grew up in New York City so, you know, we certainly had our violence and things -- ah, and certainly very mixed neighborhoods I grew up in.  But, one of the things that they find with the kids though -- you know, today even less number of years -- is they don't seem to have the same fears that we do.  They can't seem to differentiate between, like, what's fiction and what's real, with cartoons and stuff.  You know, look-- even, like, in these amusement parks today, every ride is, you know, violence and, you know, scaring kids.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's -- yeah, growing up, reading has that.  We didn't need to be scared. [LAUGH] 
L:  And, I -- yeah, that -- you know, that part about not knowing what's real and stuff, I -- I think that's the problem with a lot of the kids.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They think that that's real life, some of that stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And --
R:  Yeah, I remember watching some these TV shows, they'll show, you know -- ah, I don't watch it.  I just see the commercials.  But, these kids will take wrestling serious and jump off the roofs on to people and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Someone killed some young girl or something 'cause some --
L:  Ye- -- yeah.  They --
R:  -- older boy thought it was fun.
L:  They --
R:  Crushed her.
L:  -- body slammed her or something.
R:  Yeah.  Weird.
L:  But, you know, I think to start with, a kid has to have a problem to do -- to believe it that much.  But, [MN] you know, what they read and see may not -- you know, that might hurt a little bit too, if they're not really in the real world mentally --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or emotionally.  But, you know, this is kind of a [SIGH] hard topic to really, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- have one opinion, yes or no, totally on.
R:  Oh, 'cause the problem with censorship is in reality censorship -- there's nothing wrong with censorship to a degree 'cause we all have things, which obviously are inappropriate for kids.  The big question is, who makes that decision? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Who decide -- what I consider wrong you may consider right, or vice versa.  So, in reality you need -- everyone has to agree.  There has to be some kind of censorship because you don't wanna expose kids to certain things.  I mean, that's just reality.  And who doesn't -- got a mental problem. But, the question is where do you draw that line?  And we all draw the lines different places.
L:  Yeah.  It's really -- [MN] that's a tough one.  It's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, I [MN] -- like, I started out by saying I'm against it, but then, you know, the more you talk about it you can see --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- points --
R:  [MN]
L: -- in favor of it.
R:  Sex, violence -- do you want --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- your kids reading about drugs and, you know, sensationalizing how great it is to do LSD or something?
L:  No, they hear about it enough from their friends --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know, without having to read about it.
R:  Yeah.  You don't want 'em to read some of the stuff from the sixties saying how great it is to do these drugs and, you know, tripping and those other stuff -- ah, you do believe in some censorship.  Plus, it's unhealthy for the kids.  It's not the behaviour you want them to emulate. [LAUGH]  So -- but -- so, I guess probably everyone does want some censorship, to some degree.
L:  Yeah -- yeah.  The more you talk about it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we do need a little bit.  We just don't need to get carried away and pull some the books that -- that they've been talking about pulling of shelves.
R:  Right.  Mhm.
L:  I mean, you know, like, a lot of schools don't -- Carrie -- it's a very violent book, but I read it and I enjoyed it.
R:  Which book?
L:  By Stephen King. Carrie.
R:  Oh, Stephen --
L:  And I guess I can see why some of the schools are pulling that off the shelves --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- because of the violence, but I actually enjoyed the book.
R:  Right.
L:  I knew it was fiction.
R:  But, would you want, you know, today's twelve year old reading that?  I mean, you can probably make a case either way, so -- you know, it's violence -- you don't want to, but you kind of want the kid to make the choice.  So --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  -- probably some kids can read it and not have a problem.  Probably others can't [LAUGH] I guess.
L:  Maybe -- there -- there -- ah, there are some books that maybe are only acceptable for high school age.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, maybe when you're talking middle school -- high school you gotta look at it a little bit different.
R:  Sure.  You got to --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- [MN] hopefully they mature a little bit. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hopefully.  I don't know about that, but --
L:  I work with both age groups, so it's kind of tough.
R:  Uh-huh.   And sometimes I'm sure some of the teenagers are less mature than some of the ten and eleven year olds. [LAUGH]
