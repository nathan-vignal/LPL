R:  Hi.  I'm Brian.
L:  Hi, Brian.  My name is Deborah.  Where do you live?
R:  Hi, Deborah.  I live in Corpus Christi, Texas.
L:  Oh boy.  You're a --
R:  [MN]
L: -- long, long way away.  I'm in Los Angeles.
R:  Oh, wow.  I visited there, um, year before last and loved it.  I loved it.
L:  Yes, it's --
R:  I don't know why.
L:  -- a great place to --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- live.  That's why it's very expensive and it's -- lots of traffic, but it's not different than Philadelphia, or New York, or any major -- Corpus Christi's probably pretty big, right?
R:  No, actually it's not.  It's -- it's --
L:  Oh, it's not?
R:  -- um, it's about three hundred thousand people, but, um, you know, to me that's not very big.  Um --
L:  So, it's not like Dallas?
R:  Right -- right.  Um, I -- I'm actually -- I lived in Corpus most of my life.  I went to school in San Antonio --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, which is a bigger city, which -- that's actually where I'm driving from right now.  But, um --
L:  You --
R:  you know, I --
L:  -- don't have that bad of an accent though.
R:  Well, thank you. 
L:  I mean, you don't sound like a typical -- 'cause in California it's funny, where there's very few people from the south or Texas.  It's mostly east coast or native Californians.  And you get --
R:  We also went --
L: -- a lot of people sh- --
R:  We also went to San Diego, and I loved it there too.  God, that --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- was absolutely gorgeous.
L:  Yeah.  It is.  How are your school systems where you live?
R:  Um, well, I think they could use a lot of help.  I think most school systems could use a lot of help.
L:  Well, ours are --
R:  Um --
L:  -- ours are disg- -- ours are disgraceful.
R:  Really?
L:  The public schools, yeah.  I had to -- we had to send our son to private school.  We had to sacrifice.  And that's one reason we only had one child, because, um -- and the reason that the public schools are lousy is because they're all thieves.
R:  Right.
L:  That -- that's not because there's a lack of money, because a friend of ours, um, was very involved in his school system, and so was I.  I was very involved with the parent association 'cause my son, in the elementary school level -- in the area we live, the -- the, ah, elementary school was very good because it's more, um, affluent area.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And the parents would have, um, fundraisers and everything to get air conditioning and get books for the school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And just as my son graduated they put a stop to that, saying that's not fair to the inner city schools.  And so, they were no longer allowed to do that.  So, for the seventh through to the twelfth grade we had to send him to private school because -- let's say you wanna buy a map for a room, and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you could buy map at Costco for two bucks.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  You couldn't buy that map at Costco, you had to go through the school board.  That map cost fifty bucks --
R:  Right.
L:  -- from their vendor.  That's why there's no money.  And then, the --
R:  Sounds --
L:  -- um --
R:  -- like government. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, it is.  And then -- then the people -- the administrators -- besides having too many administrators -- the administrators have to go to Florida, or they have to go to Hawaii and have a meeting. 
R:  Right.
L:  The meetings are from eight to ten AM.  So, they --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- got a two hour meeting, and the rest of the time us taxpayers are paying for them to go golf and have a good time.
R:  Horrible.
L:  It's horrible.
R:  Horrible.
L:  It -- it's worse than horrible.  And, ah, they're trying to do something about it.  But, everyone that runs for the school board and says, "I'm gonna change it", after they're there a year and they see all the money they can make on the side, they become a baddie just like everyone else.
R:  Oh, absolutely.  And, you know, money talks.  That -- that's -- that's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just the thing.  And, you know -- and fortunately I am product of a private school.  Um, I went from -- I went to private school from pre kinder all the way through the twelfth grade, and I can not tell you how wonderful it was for me to go.  And to talk to my friends, and people that I went to college with, and people that I work with that went to public schools -- I can not tell you how much more of an opened mind, how much more of an education I received, even without my college degree.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Even before I did any of those things, um, how much more I learned, how much more these people took an interest in caring for me, um --
L:  Well, they're smaller classes too.  There was only, like, twenty kids in the class maximum.
R:  Right.  Well, I -- mine were a little larger.  I mean, my graduating class was about thirty eight.
L:  Were you at a Christian --
R:  Um --
L:  -- school or a regular pr- -- ah, private school?
R:  At Catholic school -- Catholic.
L:  Yeah, Catholic usually has bigger classes.
R:  Um, but, you know, I can't -- I can -- I can't even express how -- how -- how important it was -- not important, but how it impacted me, and I didn't realise that, you know.  When I was younger I hated wearing uniforms, and I hated going to school, and I hated any of those things.  And, um -- and, now I look back on it I'm, like, "You know, that was the best education my mother ever could have put me through -- ever, ever, ever".
L:  Exactly.  And they're getting away from the uniforms now.  Even the Catholic schools are ve- -- getting lax.  In other words, they could wear -- um, they'll have a choice of maybe black, navy and beige --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and certain --
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  -- tops, certain colors, so that it's -- it's n- -- it's uniform, but it's not a +specific uniform.  And when --
R:  Right.
L: -- my son went to -- he went to a, um, ah, non sectarian, ah, public school -- ah, private school.  And they had the same thing.  The uniforms -- the pants had to be, like, Docker type pants.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they had a choice of beige, black and navy.  And then the tops, they had, like, three or four colors and they could buy them anywhere.  They couldn't have designer clothes -- you know, like Dockers they could have, or they could have, you know, um -- I don't even think they were allowed to have Izard[?] -- whatever --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, like a golf type shirt -- so that the kids that didn't have as much money, or the kids that were on scholarships wouldn't feel different than, ah, the -- the real wealthy kids.
R:  Right. 
L:  So --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it does -- it does make a difference, the education.  And I'm sure, like you say, you -- you appreciate it now. And my son got into a very good college.  He graduated in four years and probably would not have done that had he gone to a public school.
R:  I -- I -- I -- I did also, you know.  And I -- I think that -- that I do attribute all of my -- my knowledge and all of my intelligence to going to a public school.  I -- I -- I remember things from school.  I remember things from middle school and from high school and from elementary.  You know, years later I can still remember my teachers and how they taught things and how I can remember things, and I -- I used a lot of that when I got to college.
L:  Well, that's --
R:  You know, and --
L:  -- good.
R:  -- and I -- I look at -- at my -- my cousins and I'm -- I'm sitting and -- and listening to what they're learning in public school, and I'm -- I'm looking at my uncle and I'm, like, "You know, why don't you send them to private?  They're not learning anything".
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  You know, their teacher is sitting there wearing jeans and a tee shirt to school and, um, you know, she has a phone --
L:  Kids don't --
R:  -- in her room and --
L:  -- have respect for them.
R:  No --
L:  They -- they're --
R:  -- no -- no -- no.
L:  The dress code is -- is totally gone down the tubes for the teachers.
R:  I mean, my teachers wore suits, and, you know, the ones that weren't teachers were nuns.  And --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, that -- that was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you respected that.  You automatically respected it.  You respect a uniform.  You respect somebody --
L:  Of course --
R:  -- that's dressed, you know.
L:  Even -- even you go into --
R:  Positively.
L:  -- a department store, any place of business, you see the person in a suit -- he could be the janitor and he's going to change his clothes.  And the guy next to him in a -- in jeans and a polo could be the president of the company, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you're automatically gonna assume that the person with the suit -- what college did you go to?
R:  Ah, I went to University of Texas at San Antonio.
L:  Oh, okay.  And so you --
R:  And I loved it.
L:  -- were able to do it -- you were able to do it in four years?
R:  Yes I did.  I took a lot of, um, dual credit -- I -- unfortunately for me failed the eighth grade and -- um, not by teachers standards of course, but by my own.  Um --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I found out that it was a lot more fun to play than it was to, um, go to school.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  And so, I took a lot of dual credit classes and a lot of make up classes.  Um, went to school during the summer.  Ah, went to night school my junior -- senior year, um, at a local community college, um, and tried to make up for it.  So, I technically took a little longer than four years.  Um --
L:  That's okay.
R:  -- but as far as from the time that I graduated 'til the time that I graduated from college, it was four years.
L:  Well, that's terrific.
R:  You know, so I did -- I did a lot of make up work, which I needed to do and it -- it broadened my education.  Um, I got a great job when I -- when I graduated from college.  And, you know, um -- and -- and, you know, I've been there ever since.  And I -- I use a lot of my knowledge that I did learn from college and from experience, um, in my cur- -- my current job.  And I listen to the people that -- and -- and I work with a lot of people who went to four year universities and who have degrees, but they went to public school.  
L:  Right.
R:  And, you know -- and -- and I -- I'm listening to them or I'm seeing some of them go to school now to try to get masters degrees et cetera, and I -- I hate to say this, but these are thirty and forty year old people who have absolutely no idea how to study.
L:  [LAUGH] Doesn't surprise me.
R:  And I'm sitting there going, "You know, maybe you need to turn the TV off and turn the radio off and --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- you know, stop worrying about whether or not your cell phone's gonna ring, and, um, you know, et cetera.  Learn how to study.  Sit down and -- and try".  That's the number one thing is nobody's trying any more.
L:  Right. [MN] 
R:  You know, nobody wants to.  It -- it's too hard.
L:  Yeah, but the public schools unfortunately, um, in most -- there are certain parts of California that, ah, have good public schools, but most of them aren't the, um, areas where you can find a good job as well.  Then -- then the husband has to drive an hour and half to get to his, ah, business.
R:  Right.
L:  And some -- we know some people that do that and we weren't willing to drive that far, so we sent him to, um -- to private school instead.  And then he went to public college, so -- he went to the University of, um -- where'd you go to school [inaudible]?  Um, [NOISE] UCSB, University of California, Santa Barbara.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And that was a real hardship having, ah, to go to school right at the beach.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  And it's -- and it -- and --
R:  I went to -- I went to a public university too, but only for the reason that I just couldn't afford private.  I wanted to --
L:  well, neither could --
R:  -- go to a trinity --
L:  -- we, after we just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- spent all that money for -- for private elementary school.  Plus, the UC schools are one of the top in the country anyway.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.  Well, U- UC Santa Barbara's almost, ah, right up there with UCLA.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And his apartment was right on the, ah -- right on the ocean --
