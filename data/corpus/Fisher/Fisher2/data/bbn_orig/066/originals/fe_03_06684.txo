R:  Hi, I'm Ella.
L:  [SIGH] And I'm Pat.  How are you?
R:  [SIGH] Oh, I'm fine, uh, Pat, how are you?
L:  Pretty good, pretty good. [SIGH] 
R:  And where do you live?
L:  [LIPSMACK] I live in Tampa, Florida.
R:  Oh, great.  I live in [SIGH] Grants Pass, Oregon. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, my goodness, [LAUGH] we are very far apart. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes. [SIGH] do you exercise every day?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, I used to until about a month and a half ago where, um, I got injured at work --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] and now I'm having problems with my, uh, back.  I have two dislocated discs --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- [SIGH] that are pinching the sciatica nerve, so [SIGH] unfortunately I cannot exercise any more which is just driving me crazy.
R:  [SIGH] Oh, I imagine it is. [SIGH] Uh --
L:  [SIGH] Uh, what about you?
R:  [SIGH] Well, I try to walk each day, [SIGH] not --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- not as much as, um, I would like to because, [SIGH] um, [SIGH] about a year ago I had surgery on my ankle and it, uh [SIGH] -- it, uh, keeps me from walking so much, but, uh, I find that if I go up and down stairs --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [SIGH] um, several time a day it keeps my ankle [SIGH] limber and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, it, uh, doesn't hurt [NOISE] so badly, so [SIGH] --
L:  I see.
R:  -- I will do it -- will do that. [NOISE] [SIGH] 
L:  Exactly.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, at least you're -- you're able to do something, I mean, I -- actually, I was the type of person that I was going to the gym [SIGH] at least five days a week --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] and I was doing aerobics and I was doing, you know, um, weights and I was doing machines. [SIGH] I would spend at least an hour every day and then I had to cut that from one day to the other, so it's been --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you know, um, [SIGH] a big change in my lifestyle I -- I should say. [SIGH] But, uh, hopefully, you know, um, I will get this problem solved and I can do back to do what I w- was doing, because to m-
R:  Oh, I -- I hope you will because you feel so much better when you can exercise [SIGH] and --
L:  [SIGH] It -- exactly, it's just --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like a -- you know, even when you take a shower, you know, it's the same feeling, it's just like, [SIGH] oh, my god, you feel so much fresher and full of energy and ready to do more stuff and [SIGH] so, uh, l- if you can imagine, uh, I'm being just, you know, uh, really, uh, feeling bad about not being able to exercise.
R:  Oh.
L:  [SIGH] Is that the only thing that you do, or do you do any sports or ?
R:  Um, [SIGH] no, I don't do much sport. [SIGH] I'm seventy two years old. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, my goodness, and you still, uh, you know, stay active and everything.  Good for you.
R:  [MN] Yeah, we, um -- both my husband and I --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- we keep pretty active. [SIGH] Not -- he's not as active as I because [SIGH] he had a -- [SIGH] a total knee replacement three years ago and --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- then [SIGH] a year ago he had to have that replaced [MN] -- replaced [SIGH] and --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- it still bothers him, so [SIGH] he, uh, doesn't -- he isn't able to, uh, [SIGH] be as active as he once was, but [SIGH] --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- he keeps -- he keeps very busy.  He does yard work and, uh, even though it, uh, [SIGH] hurts him, well, he still does it because he can't stand to sit around and do nothing. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, absolutely --
R:  [SIGH] So --
L:  -- absolutely.
R:  [MN] 
L:  Well, let me tell you before, you know, uh, all this starting happening to me, I used to play, uh, racket ball professionally.
R:  Oh, you did?
L:  Yes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, I did that for a couple of years and, um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] like, sometimes you can imagine it's just, uh, one thing has, you know -- uh, had happened and now I'm doing nothing and I'm going crazy. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, I know you are.  Yes, it really makes a difference. [SIGH] What kind of accident did you have?
L:  [SIGH] Um, it was at work --
R:  Oh, that's right, you told me.
L:  -- I just went underneath my desk --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and -- uh, to check for the computer number [SIGH] and my back, uh, locked on me --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and they had to -- they had -- you know, some people that work with -- work me had to drag me from underneath the desk --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- and of course I'm being, you know, through MRIs and CAT scans and all this stuff and that's when they discovered that I have, you know, two -- [SIGH] two discs out of place.
R:  Oh, two discs out of place, uh-huh.
L:  Exactly, so --
R:  That's really pain -- that's very painful, I know.
L:  It is.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I've been going through therapy --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] which is a little bit of exercise, I should say, I mean, not a s- a s- you know, hard core as I used to but --
R:  Mm, but that helps.
L:  -- um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] it's -- it's -- it's not the same.  I don't feels that I'm active at all, but, uh --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- just trying to get my -- you know, uh, my back [SIGH] uh, back to, you know, the way it was but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- at this point it's not working --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it -- it -- all the things that I'm doing are not working out, so [SIGH] uh, we'll see.  It's just one of those things that sometimes you -- you cannot prevent.  They happen and, [SIGH] well, you just need to adjust, right?
R:  [SIGH] That's true, yeah, mhm, mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] yeah, so, hopefully, you know, I will be able to go back to do something.  I've been thinking about, uh, walking, like you are doing --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [SIGH] but I asked, uh, the doctor that is, uh, assisting me --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] with my problem and, uh, [SIGH] at this point he's telling me, "Well, what type of walking?  Are you talking, you know, like, uh, ten miles, or just ?" [SIGH] 
R:  Oh.
L:  And I'm, uh -- uh, I don't know, I mean, I, uh -- to be quite honest with you, I don't know how much I would be able to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] uh, stand, you know.  If it's just a coup- a couple of miles or is it [MN] less than a mile or something I --
R:  that would -- [MN] I would start out just less than a mile.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Uh, do you live --
L:  Exactly, I've been e- I've been thinking about even get a treadmill --
R:  [SIGH] Oh, oh, y-
L:  -- so I can do it at home because here is so hot.
R:  Oh, yeah, uh-huh.
L:  And right now it's so humid, that just doing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- stuff outdoors is -- is uncomfortable. [SIGH] 
R:  Oh, that is a --
L:  [SIGH] So, I'm thinking maybe --
R:  -- that would be very helpful, to have a treadmill.  Mhm.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Maybe something like a treadmill, you know, I can have it inside, and like you're saying, maybe I can start little by little, maybe, you know, [SIGH] ten minutes the first day, then continue on it and start adding [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, but [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Just go slow at first.
L:  -- I don't know, it's one of the things that I'm going to try.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um -- but definitely I really need to go back to do something.  Of course, as you can imagine, I had gained weight. [LAUGH] 
R:  I kn- I know, that's what happened to me to.  I gained weight when I [SIGH] couldn't [MN] walk with my ankle surgery [SIGH] and, um, [SIGH] it's -- it's hard to take it off. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, I'm telling you.  Absolutely.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] And I'm -- you know, I'm -- I'm forty four years old, so I'm going through that stage where [SIGH] you're --everything, your body and your hormones and -- and your metabolism, everything's changing.
R:  Yeah, that's true, at that age, uh-huh.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] So, I really feel that, you know, I -- I just feel terrible. [LAUGH] 
R:  I -- I know, and if you could just exercise. [SIGH] Like, we used to get up in the morning --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [SIGH] and before we did anything else and we'd go for a walk probably for about two miles, [SIGH] and then --
L:  Excellent.
R:  -- when we came home we would, um, [SIGH] have breakfast and really that just started our day.  We felt so good all during the day, so 
L:  Exactly, [SIGH] it gives you energy, right, to just --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like, you're saying, to start your day.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know --
R:  [SIGH] Or --
L:  -- but [MN] --
R:  Go ahead.
L:  -- yeah, I -- I agree with you a hundred percent on what you're saying and but -- and so it's hard not being able even -- it's -- it's not that I don't want to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] it's that I can't --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- at this point, and that makes a difference because mentally, you know, it's like, "I wish I could do this".  But then physically it's -- it's you know -- it's, uh, the --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- the problem.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I can't, so 
R:  Are you able to work, then?
L:  [SIGH] Well, I'm on reduced schedule, I'm working --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- on- only four hours a day.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH] But, uh -- but with limited -- I have limitations on everything.  I -- limited standing, limited walking, limited, uh, sitting, limited everything.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] So, uh, definitely, [MN] as -- as I mentioned before, my lifestyle has changed completely --
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  -- [SIGH] and especially in an area like this, if you can imagine Florida, [SIGH] you're always doing stuff.
R:  [SIGH] I imagine so.
L:  [SIGH] It --
R:  I've never been to Florida, so, [SIGH] no.
L:  Oh, you haven't?
R:  No, I --
L:  Oh, you have to.
R:  No.
L:  You know, take the time and come over here.
R:  Oh, well, that's quite a ways. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] It is -- it is very different --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, [LIPSMACK] right now it's so hot though and so humid, but, um [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- there is always something going on some -- always something happening --
R:  I --
L:  -- so, it is, um -- like, until I feel -- I feel [MN] so bad not being able to do anything [SIGH] when I -- all my surroundings, you know, are just [SIGH] activities and things to do and things going all the time, so it is -- it is just um [LIPSMACK] --
R:  It's hard for you.
L:  -- it's been very difficult.
R:  Mhm, I can imagine why [SIGH] when --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Exactly.
R:  -- you're used to being so active and then [SIGH] --
L:  Oh, absolutely.
R:  -- not able to.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  Mhm.  So I know you're looking --
L:  [SIGH] So, you're just -- you're saying that you're just walking every day?
R:  Yes, that's basically what I --
L:  Do you do it by yourself at this point?
R:  [SIGH] Uh, sometimes my husband walks with me.
L:  Okay, that's good.
R:  But not very far. [LAUGH] And then --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- I go up and down the steps quite a few times, so --
L:  Good for you.
R:  -- so that's, uh, -- that helps [SIGH] with the --
L:  Oh, absolutely.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Just, you know, anything -- anything that you can do, uh, it -- it always helps and it's just, uh [SIGH] -- and I think it's also a mental thing because sometimes --
R:  [SIGH] Oh, I think so too.
L:  -- people say -- exactly, you know, "Oh, no, I'm too old for this" or, "No, I'm to old for that" but then [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] like, I -- I mean, [SIGH] it is great that at your age and everything --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- mentally you -- you are aware that you need to stay active [SIGH] and that you need to do something for that.
R:  Oh, well, we plan to do that.  And then we work outside in the yard, my husband more than I, but, [SIGH] uh, sometimes --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- I help him out there, [SIGH] and that's -- that's good, just o be outside and to, uh, be moving around. [LAUGH] 
L:  Exactly.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] Now, how is -- how is the weather over there right now?
R:  [SIGH] Um, we're just having a really nice spring day. [LAUGH] It --
L:  Excellent.
R:  -- it's, um -- it's pretty cool today, um, Saturday and Sunday it was very warm --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- But, uh -- well, it got up to eight five which we thought was hot. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, my god. [LAUGH] 
R:  So [SIGH] -- so, today I think it's seventy five, so it's really pleasant.
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, I bet.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, yeah, well --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- we are not going to have one day -- one day l-
