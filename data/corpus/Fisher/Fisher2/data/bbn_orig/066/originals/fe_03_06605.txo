R:  Hello? 
L:  Hi I'm Mary Jane.
R:  I'm Linda.
L:  Hi Linda.
R:  From Indiana. 
L:  Oh, in Indiana? 
R:  Yeah --
L:  I'm in Arizona.
R:  -- so where are you from?  Arizona, okay -- okay nice to meet you.
L:  Is this your first call? 
R:  Oh, this is my second call. 
L:  Mine too.
R:  So would you like to go first or would you like me to? 
L:  Um, you can go ahead I -- do they -- I think they tell us go ahead after a minute.
R:  Oh, they do? 
L:  Well they did on my last one but I guess go ahead.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] They didn't on my last one.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, they said, "Okay now start".  That's what they did on the last one.
R:  Oh, is that right?  Oh, that's interesting.  Well I guess the topic is, um, public school -- did they say private too?  Was it public and private or just public?
L:  I don't know.  [LAUGH]
R:  And they said if, um, --
L:  I heard public for sure.
R:  Yeah I heard that too if, um, kids should not be allowed to read certain books.
L:  I thought they said should kids be requested to read certain books in Public Schools.
R:  Oh, really? 
L:  Maybe I heard wrong.
R:  Oh, I thought they said that if you -- if that --
L:  You are probably right because at the beginning they said this is on censorship.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So you're probably right.
R:  Yeah, I think -- I think it was books that, um, that should they not be you know -- should be certain books that they should not be allowed.
L:  Okay.
R:  To read.
L:  Alright go ahead.
R:  Okay -- [LAUGH] okay now for me that's -- that's a real pet peeve I have and I definitely believe that there are certain books that they should not have to read such as the -- the elementary kid's there's books by RL Stein, which I don't know if you're familiar with that author or not.  He's, um, um, does like just -- I don't know like evil bad stuff.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  And the books in the elementary are not as bad like they -- it like sucks the kids in with those and then by the time they get to Junior High and High School his later stuff is really bad, you know like really evil and stuff.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  And that like you know gets the kids when they're younger, "Oh, well we like those books" you know I think they're good bouncers is what they are and then later they're you know like -- like really bad.
L:  Well I'm right there with you.
R:  Are you?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah I was up at my school in fifth grade and in sixth grade my son -- son -- son chose to be home school for that year because he didn't want to deal anymore with, um, speaking out.  He -- he had -- he had a teacher who chose to introduce books that was even against your school district.
R:  Oh, my god.
L:  And, um, we were up there -- I used to be a schoolteacher.  So we were up at the school -- well we were at the school several times but one of the times I was there -- well the first time I was there I found out, um, she spoke up and told the Vice Principal trying to show that my son was a trouble maker because he had spoken out before that about a book that I didn't even know -- I didn't even -- I didn't know any of this had gone on.
R:  Right.
L:  He had -- he had raised his hand and said, "You know I don't want to sit here and hear this".
R:  Right.
L:  And --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, and he had gone in fact he had left the class -- he finally -- in fact he told all of the kids they shouldn't be listening to it and he gut up and left the classroom.
R:  You know that happened to my son when he was in seventh grade.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  At the end of the school year, we also had a rule at home that we wouldn't let our kids watch PG thirteen movies well then in the school they were running PT thirteen movies and so my son took a stand and he went up to the teacher which she announced it was the end of the year they were going to watch this movie and before she started it he goes, "I'm -- I'm not allowed to watch that you know, we don't watch -- my family doesn't watch those kind of movies" and she just goes, "Well fine that's okay" she goes "Just take your books down and you can go sit in the hall" and she made him sit in the hall and other kids walked by him and thought that he was in trouble and I was just like I don't believe those you know this is like so bad you know.
L:  We were up at the school -- we went to the school the first time and could not get, um, at first we couldn't get anybody to listen to us and the Vice Principal finally looked at the book over the weekend and he did apologize seriously to us and explained to her it was called, um, school -- The Doll House Murders.
R:  Oh, my god.
L:  And it's based on spiritualism.
R:  And that was six grade or fifth grade?
L:  Fifth grade, he -- she had come from, um, a school district in Texas right on the boarder she said this is what the children were into spiritualism and this and that --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- anyway he explained to her well we don't --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know -- well that's not acceptable in our district and this and that, took some of the blame because apparently she had submitted something and he hadn't really looked at it, then she chose -- well then we find out then this is before the big Harry Potter thing well that was the book my son it chose to walk out on.
R:  Right.
L:  And she wasn't for it either but even after all of that happened she brought in another book that was really -- really bad and they didn't want to listen to me, just because I had been up there before I guess.
R:  Right.
L:  And, um, --
R:  Well that's the school backing the wrong thing.
L:  Yeah and it's really -- it's really unusual cause I'm in a very conservative, um, district.
R:  Right.
L:  And it's a district I used to teach in but, um, -- in fact they all got moved and I don't know what was going on this Vice Principal, the teacher's gone, the Vice Principal and the Principal was on the next year.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  But -- but we had a full year -- she -- she just didn't care.
R:  -- of battling it.
L:  I mean he explained to her you know this -- this is not what your district's about and this and that and she just brought in book after book.  I mean they just got worse each book got worse.
R:  Right -- right.
L:  And it was just --
R:  That was her way of saying I'm going to do what I want.
L:  Yep.
R:  Yeah oh gracious, and that's so awful for the kids.
L:  Yep.
R:  They're so impressionable at those ages anyway and then when they hear that everybody else is reading them or doing it you know and it's like, "Oh, my goodness", you know.
L:  And I said this is one thing I didn't want to deal with, I said "You can be home school"
R:  Right.
L:  So he chose to do that the next year cause he didn't want to deal again and have another year of dealing with.
R:  You know that's -- my oldest son is like that where he would stand up for what was right and if he thought unjust things like that in the school system he would -- he would voice an opinion against it and the same thing happened to him he was labelled a trouble maker, and really and he didn't -- it was real hard for him because he didn't understand well you know I'm just doing the right thing.
L:  Yep.  
R:  You know why are they not listening, and it was -- that was real hard to explain but as he got older then he did see you know well they're doing the wrong thing you know.
L:  Well they -- they banned books now that are -- books that I would approve of.
R:  Right.
L:  So I don't understand why --
R:  Right.
L:  -- there are books that a lot of us disapprove of.
R:  Yeah I don't understand -- I don't understand that either I -- I always wondered what would it take to get it removed and obviously if they're doing a survey on how people feel about this or how parents feel about this you know maybe something will be done but I know I had discussed with my husband I said with all of the stuff in the public schools today I said, "If I had a start right today with my kids in school I would not put them in the public school".
L:  Yeah I wouldn't.  My daughter's keeping her home -- she -- they're not in school age yet.
R:  Right.
L:  And she already having watched everything and she's keeping her home.
R:  Right.
L:  I wouldn't of either.
R:  Right and it's a shame because I think that the public school used to offer a lot you know and my kids -- well my youngest graduates this week from high school and they went -- mine both went all of the way to public school but in high school we strongly wanted them to move to a private school and they chose to stay where they were at and they're both Christian guys and they said, "No we'll stand strong" you know and then did but it was hard, you know and I said, "Boy if I had started with five year olds over there's no way I would put them in the midst of that again"
L:  Yeah especially now I wouldn't.
R:  Oh, exactly -- exactly.
L:  It was --
R:  And there's so many good books out there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's what is so tragic and even if there's a certain point or something specific they want them to learn there's so many wonderful alternatives to the bad stuff you know.
L:  Yep I feel exactly the same way and I -- I, um, -- I feel bad for my son because he's going to start High School next year but he went back in seventh grade and what I see is, um, he has a hard time understanding even the people that you're supposed to respect.
R:  Exactly.
L:  The adults.
R:  That was real hard for my son to understand.
L:  Yep.
R:  And I you know it was like well some adults don't do the right thing either, you know and it's just sucks so hard you know to have to explain that and for them to understand that you know because that's who we send them how many hours a week you know in -- in -- we entrust them to these teachers and then when they come home with things and like, "Oh, my goodness".  But we were talking about  --
L:  But their bond is about you know about the books and censorship and entrusting you know to the teachers.
R:  Right.
L:  Entrusting them to you know introduce our children to good material, they would not have apparently the thing was you know you do you think they should be able to have censorship if they didn't have any cens-
