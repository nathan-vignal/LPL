L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  I'm Sandra.
L:  Hi, Sandra.  I'm Natalie.
R:  Hi, Natalie.  Where are you from?
L:  I'm from Philadelphia.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm from Canada.
L:  Oh, really?  Are you in Canada now?
R:  Yep, mhm.
L:  That's pretty cool. [NOISE]
R:  [MN]
L:  I didn't realise that the study was international.  That's awesome.
R:  Yeah.  Well, it just showed up on my computer one day so I said, "Well, whatever". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's pretty much what happened to me.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So -- well, that'll be an interesting topic on censorship then because, ah, I guess they have different public school systems there.  So --
R:  Yeah.  We've, um -- we've become a lot more liberal.  Like, my kids are grown now -- become --
L:  Mhm.
R: -- a lot more liberal. But, they're -- they used to be quite, quite, quite bad.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  And they would forbid, like, certain books from being read?
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Not even on, ah, books from, like, a school.  I'm off topic here but, ah, even movies were -- were banned from our province. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  That were just silly ones, you know -- not -- not any- -- not anything too bizarre or anything, but -- so, no.  Um, but things have lightened up a little bit.
L:  Ha.
R:  What's it like down there?
L:  Um, people are really -- I mean, because of the whole [PAUSE] -- that's -- being the first amendment.  It gives -- there's rarely a problem specifically with censorship, and more just with people having discernment about -- like, it's, like, yes you have the right to free speech.  No, we technically can't really ban just about anything.  So, the problem that I have I seeing people act like morons and saying, "Well, I have the right to free speech.  I can say whatever I want and I can be as offensive as possible".  And it's, like, "Well, you know, it's a privilege and a responsibility, ah, in addition to being a right".
R:  Mhm.
L:  So -- but in school specifically, um, we didn't have -- it -- it was more of a -- they -- they would direct you away from certain books, and -- and there were certain things that -- that we had a very specific slant to the history that we were taught, but they didn't outright ban any books.  Um, but that had happened in the history of the United States in the past.  Like, ah, in, ah -- when To Kill A Mocking Bird came out, by Harper Lee, that was banned.
R:  Yeah -- yeah. 
L:  Um --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, we had a movement here to, ah, ban Harry Potter of all things from libraries, but --
L:  Oh my gosh.  Because of the -- the -- I guess it was a Christian coalition movement?
R:  Yeah.  Well, we've got --
L:  Yeah.
R:  We're -- our province is pretty well founded, ah, by Temperance Society.
L:  Oh, okay.  Which -- which province are you in? 
R:  Saskatchewan.
L:  Hm.
R:  So, um, it sticks.  There's more churches in our province than there is, ah, restaurants, so --
L:  Oh my gosh.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, so I guess that was something that -- and especially if you don't read it, it seems offensive to their sensibility[?].
R:  Yeah -- yeah -- yeah -- yeah, so -- yeah they've, like -- it's just plain stupid as far as I'm concerned.
L:  Yeah, I agree.  [MN] That actually -- now that you mention it, I think that happened here too with, um -- like, a lot of Southern Baptists were up in arms about the -- the Harry Potter books as being, you know, subversive and satanic, [LAUGH] so --
R:  Yeah.  Well, it's, like, "Did they read The Hobbit, you know?"  +Hello, there's a lot of --
L:  Yeah.
R: -- magic in there too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]
R:  So -- but, ah, I mean, this is a hard issue to keep going on, isn't it? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well, they are funny.  The last one I had, um -- gosh, I don't even remember what it was.  One of my friends had household pets -- was their issue, and they had to talk about household pets for ten minutes. [LAUGH] 
R:  That was easy.  I have two cats.  So [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  Yeah.  So -- um, do you --
L:  We had --
R:  -- think --
L:  -- um -- sorry, what?
R:  Well, I was [several inaudible words] censorship.  Do you think there is anything that should be censored? [COUGH] 
L:  Um, I mean, again, I think that people have to use their discernment.  They have to exercise their judgement.  Um, so I'm -- I can't think of anything offhand that I would [MN] -- that I would advocate being censored, 'cause I think that people have to be exposed -- I think that things are out there and you have to be exposed to them.  And if it's -- particularly if it's a public school.  Um, that it's -- it's far more important to teach the kids how to -- how to pass[?] that information, like, how to dissect it and figure out, ah, what of it is -- is valid and what is invalid.  And there are certain things that I think have no -- they don't have any value.  Like, I think there are certain, um, [inaudible] for example that are just -- that are merely inflammatory rather than having a message behind it.  And I don't think it has value, but I don't think that's something that -- that a school system can judge.  So, I -- I can't think offhand of anything that I would say should be censored.
R:  [MN]
L:  I just think people need to refine their power of discernment much more than they do. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Well, I'm just -- it was while we started talking I started thinking.  A few years back, um, the gay society -- I know nothing about it 'cause I -- hey, I live in [inaudible] in Ituna[?].  I don't think you can even say gay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] You --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- know, they just don't understand it.  But --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- there was a bookshop in, um -- in Vancouver, where -- it was getting material shipped in from the States.  And they kept -- and it was a gay lesbian bookstore, or --
L:  Oh.
R:  And they -- they banned it as pornographic material.
L:  There was a movie that featured this in it.  There was a movie called, um, Better Than Chocolate --
R:  Oh, I never heard --
L:  -- and it was -- it was a -- like a -- sort of a coming of age story of a young gay woman in Vancouver.  And they -- they had a, um -- they had a -- a -- a subplot to the movie was about this -- this banning of gay --
R:  Okay.
L: -- material --
R:  Yeah -- yeah.
L: -- that was not specifically pornographic unless you don't believe in homosexuality, in which case it was. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah -- yeah-- yeah, that's --
L:  Um --
R:  -- exactly --
L: -- and here --
R:  So that --
L:  -- we had a -- sorry, what?
R:  [inaudible], go ahead.
L:  Um, here we had a -- [MN] sort of a national uproar a couple -- I guess about ten years ago over the, um -- the Piss Christ was a [NOISE] -- thank you, Seranna[?].  There was an artist, um -- sorry, one of my friends was -- there was an artist who was funded by the National Endowment for the Arts, so he got government money to produce his artwork.  And he had this, um, one piece called Piss Christ, that was a crucifix submerged in urine.  Um, and there was a furor over, well, you know, because people -- a lot of people don't believe in censorship, but he was getting government money and it was a conflict and, ah, so, similar --
R:  Yeah -- yeah.  Well, it's all crap because people are [MN] whatever unless, you know, ah, how -- this is how you build a bomb and murder so many thousands of people or whatever, you know.  Common sense has to kick in there sometime.
L:  Yeah.  That -- well, yeah, that's true.  I mean, there -- there are certain things, like I don't -- it's a tough issue when it comes to the Internet, with the term -- in terms of things that you can access.  Like, yeah, I mean, I just -- I can't fathom the mindset that would tell people -- that would indiscriminately post a website as to how to build a bomb, but they -- they are out there.  And that's the kind of thing that --
R:  Yeah.
L: -- is a lot more -- yeah, I think that would be the one thing that would perhaps be in conflict with my --
R:  Well --
L:  -- my general ideal is that you can't ban anything, but that's something that -- that's classified information, you know, like, shouldn't be --
R:  Yeah.
L: -- available to untrained professionals. [LAUGH] 
R:  Exactly.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But --
L:  But, yeah, definitely it becomes a much more complex issue, um, as the Internet expands.  So --
R:  Yeah.  Well, the [MN] -- so, well, yeah -- but, you've got -- your parents actually should be the ones that should be helping the children decide what they can and cannot read.
L:  Yeah -- yeah.
R:  So --
L:  Absolutely.  I don't -- I don't think it should be in the school systems.  I think a lot of the -- the books that are banned have had a tremendous amount of literary value, particularly here.  Like -- like, Catcher In The Rye was banned at one point --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- and, um --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- To Kill A Mocking Bird, The Great Gatsby.  Like a lot of really excellent books were banned.  And it's a matter of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, kids are gonna find this stuff. Like, you -- [LAUGH] it's better to let them read it and that -- communicate with them about it than to just pretend it's not there, or try to prevent them from reading it.
R:  Exactly.  And if you just happen to find Harry Potter or Catcher In The Rye offensive then don't read it.
L:  Exactly. [LAUGH]  Just don't --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- read it.  Like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L: -- you know --
R:  It's pretty simple stuff I'd say.
L:  Yeah -- yeah.  I think when people -- they don't have enough control over their own lives, they start to try to exert it over other peoples.  And it's, like, "You gotta work on -- you gotta look in your own backyard first", you know.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I encouraged my kids to read whatever they wanted, whenever --
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- they wanted, so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And they turned out okay.
L:  Yeah.  How old are your kids now?  They're out of --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- school, you said.
R:  -- thirty, twenty eight and twenty two.
L:  Oh, wow.  [several inaudible words]
R:  Yep -- yep.  Two professionals and one coming up.
L:  Wow.  Coming -- coming out of school then?
R:  Yep.  Just -- just graduate from engineering college, so --
L:  Oh, that's great.  Well, congratulations.
R:  Yeah.  Well, and with a little luck he won't be going to work in the States [LAUGH] and I  --
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- can see --
L:  Oh, yeah --
R:  -- him once in a while.
L:  -- that's true.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We're a have not[?] province.  We have a million people in our province though.
L:  Yeah.  So, is it not just -- I guess that's for the -- for the area that's a very small -- like, a low population density?
R:  Oh, very low.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's the same as it was in nineteen thirty three, so --
L:  Oh my gosh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that kind of tells you where our kids have been going.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  So -- but, um -- gee, I don't know.  This is a real hard one to keep going, isn't it?
L:  Yeah, the censor- -- ah, actually we've done pretty well.  I've got my car -- according to my car clock, we've done nine minutes, so --
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, we done --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'd still like to know what the point of this whole exercise is, but --
L:  Um --
R:  -- I don't know.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I've -- I've heard different things -- that it's a voice recognition study for artificial intelligence.  I'm -- I'm not sure if that's -- or if it's -- or that it's a psychology experiment.  You never know.  It was -- it's run by my university, so I don't trust them. [LAUGH]  I don't know what they're up --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- what they're up to.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] So, what do you do down in Philadelphia?
L:  Um, I was a student at Pen, and now I'm a molecular biologist.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So -- yeah, I work at --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- one of the pharmaceutical companies, just for a little while.
R:  Invent the cure the cancer quick, will you. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Trying to, ah --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Right now I do HIV research.
R:  Oh.
L:  Vaccine.
R:  Oh, okay.  That would be good too. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah?
R:  Yeah, that would be good.  Cure all diseases.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ahah.
L:  [MN]
R:  So [LAUGH] -- Well, I got --
