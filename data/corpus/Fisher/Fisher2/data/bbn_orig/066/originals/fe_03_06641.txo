L:  Hi.  My name is Beth.
R:  Hi, Beth.  This is Susan.
L:  Hi, Susan.  I could- I -- I didn't quite, uh, catch what that question was?
R:  Oh, the topic of the day was censorship and they want to know what we -- do we believe that a school -- and there was something else, or some other public institution, I guess.
L:  Right?
R:  Um, has the right to censor certain books.  
L:  Uh, that's -- uh.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I just -- wow.  I'm a mentor, I'm a volunteer mon- mentor.
R:  Uh-huh?  
L:  At an elementary school for a fifth grader.
R:  Oh, my.
L:  And, uh, it's interesting, um, you kinda have standards, what I call community standards, and you censor whether you admit it or not. 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Uh, you censor for pornography, you have a -- on the computer --
R:  Right?
L:  -- you censor for, uh -- you have, uh, a filter --
R:  Right?
L:  -- so that you cannot get pornography onto a school computer, which is really important.
R:  Right.  Well, schools, um, censor other things, I know.  Even in college, they censor, um, the downloading of MP three's, I know, but I guess that's as -- that's copyright issue, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, if you have -- I mean, it's a pretty broad question, whether -- if it's a yes or no answer, then you know, of course you have to --
L:  I think it's automatic.
R:  You have to say, yes, because --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you know, children can't see books about Marquis de Sade or, you know, some kind of --
L:  Right.
R:  -- porn.  I mean, it's just not -- it's not what they need to be looking at, and -- but if we're talking about adults, I don't know.  It depends on, you know, there's a -- an issue right in -- where I live, near [inaudible] and there's an issue at the Cal Poly right now about whether or not the teachers should be able to look at porn on their campus computers.  And first they said, no, but then they overturned it, so they said, yeah, they could go ahead and look at it, so people are kind of complaining about that.  I mean, what are they doing [LAUGH] sitting around looking at porn?  I mean, they're not --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- teaching porn, are they?  [LAUGH].  One would hope not.  It can't be research, but I guess that's a different media, you know, than a book, and they did say "books" so I --
L:  Right.  In St Pete College, uh, they are very strict anti porn.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think that's very important because --
R:  Well, it --
L:  -- it generates cookies.
R:  Oh, right.  Right.  Most people don't --
L:  And boy, you get -- I've had -- sat down to a -- a computer station more than once and had porn pop up.
R:  Right.  Most people don't know how to clean up their computer either --
L:  Right.
R:  -- from that kinda stuff.  But um, I guess for books I'd have to say, yes.  I mean, it's just too broad.  I can't really --
L:  I think that is important, that we have that right, and you do it anyway.  'Cause you censor yourself, your speech --
R:  Mm.  Mhm.
L:  -- your clothing --
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  Uh, schools have requirements about dress, so it's not -- I'm from Florida.  Where are you from?
R:  I'm from California.
L:  Oh, I loved San Francisco.  I visited San Francisco --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- last year.  The only thing that stopped me from moving there was it's so expensive.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Berkley, UFC Berkley.  
R:  Oh.  Oh, I love Berkley.  It's a fun place.
L:  And I was, um, I'm -- I was forty four when I went.
R:  Uh-huh?
L:  Yeah, I'm forty --
R:  How old are you now?
L:  -- five now.  Forty five.
R:  Uh-huh?
L:  I hate Florida.  To be honest with you.
R:  Oh, I've heard that --
L:  Education here is terrible.
R:  I've heard from other people that Florida is really --
L:  Backwards.
R:  -- nothing.  There's, like -- well, even the landscape, I've heard, is just kind of -- there's not a whole lot --
L:  Very hot and humid.  It -- uh, I tell people that you better be prepared to be self employed down here.
R:  Uh-huh?
L:  Jobs are very hard here.
R:  Yes?
L:  Very -- very poor paying, really minimum wage.
R:  Same here, though, really.
L:  Education is horrible.  I mean, I don't recommend raising a family here.
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
L:  And I wanted to tell um, uh, this family that I mentor, I -- their son, that to get their son up north, in the north east.
R:  Mhm?
L:  I'm from upstate New York originally.
R:  Uh-huh.  Are you?
L:  And I came down here --
R:  I'm from New Hampshire --
L:  -- when I was sixteen.
R:  -- originally.
L:  Oh, that's a beautiful area.
R:  Yeah.  It's funny, I -- Yankees -- I seem to get somehow or another, other easterners in my life.  Even just on a silly little survey phone call research --
L:  Oh, I love it.  I'm finding out that there's a lot of polarization between the southerners and the northerners lately.
R:  Ahah.
L:  The last couple of years, and I met a lady --
R:  Oh, yeah, they're --
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  The Bush -- Bush fans or --
L:  No, it's not about politics, about the culture.
R:  Oh.
L:  I even met a black lady from Georgia.
R:  Uh-huh?
L:  She was originally from New York.
R:  Uh-huh?
L:  And even within the black community, the dividing between the people who are sou- southern blacks --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- versuns- versus northern blacks.  
R:  What, have they got a chip on their shoulder, or what's -- what's going on?  I mean, what --
L:  I'm picking up on it, it's getting worse.  It's getting really bad here, and it's funny, we talk about California --
R:  Is it both -- working both ways, or one way or --
L:  It seems like the southerners really resent the northerners.  
R:  Huh.
L:  I get the -- feel the anger from the southern side.
R:  Huh.
L:  The chip on the shoulder.
R:  Wow.
L:  Uh --
R:  I wonder why?  They got a better climate --
L:  Because a lot of tension --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I feel that we're gonna have the southeast, is going to split from the United States within about ten to twenty years.
R:  Really?
L:  And -- we have people out here calling it the Confederate States.  
R:  Aha.
L:  It's like, and they're saying the civil war never ended and I -- I'm trying to get out of here.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I don't feel safe here.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it's funny, when I was in California, they knew about Pinellas[?] Park.  I'm from Pinellas Park.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They know about Pinellas Park, you know, the city of Pinellas Park.  
R:  Mhm?
L:  You know, and they laugh about it.
R:  Mhm?
L:  And no rights here.  
R:  There's no rights?
L:  Uh, for peop- people -- for people who are colored, black people.
R:  Oh, really?  My God.  [LAUGH].
L:  Uh, uh, uh for -- for gay people.
R:  This is two thousand and three.
L:  I know.  I --
R:  When did that war end?
L:  They shut the -- they used to have gay marches.  They shut it down.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  We no longer have that here.
R:  Oh, God.  California is like all over the gays.  They just love the rainbow community and --
L:  Oh, God.  I took pictures.  My father, he -- he said, "I hope you're not getting into that life".  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I said, "Dad, I'm too old".  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH].  Well, you never know.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh.
R:  But it's funny, you know, I mean, your father would think about that, but somebody your age, and I'm, um, fifty four, so I'm almost ten years older than you, we're -- I -- I think our generation, we don't -- we don't care what people do. 
L:  No.
R:  You know?  [LAUGH].  That's one thing I think that -- um, well, we're not censoring -- at least I'm not censoring that, but like, you -- your father, um, you would with your father.  I mean, maybe if -- if you were getting into that lifestyle, I guess it would depend on your father --
L:  It would be really bad.  And my --
R:  -- wheth- 
L:  -- mother said, "Don't go into one of those bars".  I have a mentally challenged brother.  "Don't take your brother in one of those bars, or I'll pull you out, screaming, by your hair".  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] .
L:  "And him by --" he's bald.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  He's got real thin -- sma- you know, short hair?  "I'll pull him out by his ear".  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  We chuckle about -- we laugh about it.
R:  My parents were -- my dad was from Kentucky and my mom from New Hampshire and both actually have had -- well, my dad just passed away recently, but pre- some prejudice towards the black community, but I think once they came out and lived in California, they --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, they had to get used to not just blacks, but Asians and um -- my daughter married an Iranian.  So [LAUGH] --
L:  Wow.  Is she happy?
R:  Oh, yeah.  He's an American, really.  He -- he grew up in America and England, so he -- his parents left Iran when the Shah got chased out of there.
L:  Wow.
R:  So that was quite a while ago, so --
L:  I loved it, because there was so -- uh, uh, open, California.  Uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, and people were very friendly.
R:  Oh, yeah.  
L:  Yeah, it blew my mind because people are not friendly here.
R:  The only thing about that for -- coming from an easterner that came out west, um, I at first was going, gosh, you know, people are just so great, everybody's so happy and energetic and friendly, but I found a lot of, um, superficiality there.
L:  I know.  They're --
R:  Like, it was hard --
L:  -- very shallow in California.
R:  It was hard to make friends with people that, um --
L:  People are always in a hurry.
R:  Yeah, and it --
L:  And it was funny, because they'll say, "Well, I'm in a hurry".  They'll give you thirty seconds of their undivided attention --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and then, "I'm in a hurry", and they're in a hurry to get in front of the TV set and watch the TV.
R:  Or do something.  I mean, it just --
L:  I mean, something --
R:  It's hard to --
L:  -- that I could put off.  
R:  It's hard to build friendships here.  I found that -- my really good --
L:  It's very hard to build friendships in -- in Florida, too.
R:  My really good friendships that I've met in California and Oregon, they've mostly been with people from the east.  [LAUGH].
L:  I'm thinking about moving back to New York, in fact.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Uh, uh, but my -- the thing is, I have to be willing to take the guardianship of my brother.  
R:  Oh.  Are you willing to do that?  
L:  Um, it's a lot of responsibility.  We're going up to New York for one month and I'm trying it on a one month basis.  See --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- any time that my mom and dad and I -- is out of state, or my brother and I go, like, to New York, like or I take him anywhere, like to San Francisco, if I were to do that, I ha- I automatically get guardianship of him.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's a lot of responsibility.
R:  Oh --
