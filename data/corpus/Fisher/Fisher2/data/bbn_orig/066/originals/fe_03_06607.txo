L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello?
R:  Yes?
L:  Hi, this is Ann.
R:  My name is Bobby.
L:  Hello.  I didn't hear what the topic was.
R:  Censorship.
L:  Censorship?
R:  Do we think the schools, ah, should tell students books that they cannot read.  Let's see, I've got a list of it, let's see what else is on there.  Um, well, "In your opinion is there currently something serious" -- no, that's not it, um, well, that's what she said, was censorship, about the books for children to read.  High school children, I think she said.
L:  High school?
R:  Uh-huh.  I think if they made it to high school, they've got enough -- ah, surely they should know what they wanted to read.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  But, I know when I was in, um, grammar school and I first started going to the library, started reading, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the librarian wouldn't let me go over in the adult section, she tried to keep me in the children's section, of course, there wasn't any books over there I could read, but I did want to walk around and see and see what was there and if I could read them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So -- what do you think? [SIGH]
L:  I think it should be pretty open.  I think they try to have too much control over the -- the students, --
R:  I do too.
L:  -- and that kind of makes them want to rebel anyways.
R:  Yeah, and if they're --
L:  If they want to learn, they should be able to learn about whatever they want.
R:  I think they ought to be able to read if they've made it that far, they're interested in school, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they're interested in other things besides what they're supposed to read, about learning other things, I think they should be allowed to do it.
L:  Yep.
R:  So --
L:  Reading's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- always good anyways.  It doesn't matter what they're reading, it's good for them.
R:  Yeah, I love to read.  Do you?
L:  Mhm.
R:  What do you read?
L:  I like to read, like, short stories and, poems, and --
R:  Do you?  I like mysteries.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  Yeah.  And you can just get lost in them, and --
L:  Mhm.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- forget your troubles, and, -- now, I'm still looking for that, um, I'd copied it down.  How did you get --, uh, where did you sign up from on this program?
L:  My mom signed up for me, on the computer, she signed it up, told me about it --
R:  Yeah?  This is your last call or the first call?
L:  This is my second call.
R:  Well, I missed it completely, didn't I?  This is my last one.
L:  Oh, is it?
R:  Um, I can't -- well, I guess I just might as well put it up, because it's bothering me now, but I know I read it --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- about the topics, I printed it out --
L:  Oh, did you?
R:  -- and I can't find it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So -- I wish we'd had the one about schools.  How many -- did you finish school?
L:  Yes, I'm in college right now.
R:  How old are you?
L:  Twenty.
R:  Okay, now, we need to talk! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  If one of your professors told you that you couldn't read Jane Jones Goes to the Movies, what would you do?  Would you go out and get it and read it, or go along with it?
L:  Um, if I was interested in it I would read it.
R:  Would you tell him?
L:  I don't know, ah, in the high school, last year my brother got in trouble for an art project he did that was related to reading, because he -- it involved religion.  And they threw -- he act- -- his teacher actually destroyed his project and threw it away.
R:  Did you sue?
L:  Um, --
R:  I would have.
L:  They have some conferences and things, and I -- I -- I don't know exactly how it all turned out but, but my mom went and handled it, and the teacher got in trouble [MN] somehow through the school for it, he got some kind of probation, or something like that.
R:  Well, that, um, if it's art, to different people, it's different things.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I may like a picture of, a painting of a bunch of flowers, somebody else might not.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, -- but I don't think they should be -- it should be destroyed.
L:  No.
R:  -- because, ah, certain people didn't like it.
L:  Well, he just said that they -- that he should not have brought religion into school, which I think is also ridiculous, but --
R:  What's that, um, they said they were going to keep prayer out of school.
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but how are they going to do it when it's test time and you hadn't studied?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] somebody's going to be praying.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, what college are you in?
L:  I go to the BCC, for nursing.
R:  Oh, you -- are you planning on being a nurse on the floor, or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or specialize?
L:  Yeah, right now I'm a CNA at Ormen[?] Memorial Hospital, and so I'm going to go for nursing, and then I'm -- I plan on continuing to work there.
R:  Oh, are they helping you with your -- did you get a scholarship, or they helping you with --
L:  Not yet, I've only been there about nine months, --
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- and I believe it's after a year they start a program with you.
R:  This is good, this is good, if you intend to stay there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What city are you in?  
L:  Ah, Flagware[?] Beach.
R:  Where?
L:  Flagware Beach?  It's just outside of Daytona Beach.
R:  Oh, yeah, well, I'm in South Carolina.  
L:  Are you?
R:  Yes, so, we both agree that a high school student should be allowed to read what they want to.
L:  Yeah.  But at that age, there shouldn't really be any, um, -- anything they try to keep away from them.
R:  Because then, they're going to read it or bust.
L:  Mhm.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I would!
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] and -- okay, you got any questions to ask me?
L:  Um, not really.
R:  I can't think of anything else if we both agree about it.
L:  There's not a whole lot to talk about on that topic. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] yeah, y- y- you either say I agree or I don't agree, and that's it! [LAUGH] but I still can't find it, I knew -- I know it's on here 'cause I read it.  There's one about smoking --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Are you still there?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  Okay, here it is. "Censorship.  Do either of you think public or private schools have the right to forbid students to read certain books?"  That was the question.  But she didn't read it that way.  She said, "High school", I think.
L:  Oh, -- oh, well --
R:  So --
L:  -- maybe like in religious private schools if the parents send them there with good intentions, for younger kids, though, not for the older ones.
R:  Yeah, for younger kids.  But, as many people as doesn't -- that, that, that do not know how to read, I think they should be allowed to read anything they can, I really do, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because that is one of the most enjoyable pastimes there is.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That you can escape, like -- well, I said that before --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Where did your mom hear about this?
L:  She found out on the computer somehow.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I just thought maybe she might have been on that chitchat room that had it on Refunding Makes Sense.
L:  That might have been it.  I know she goes in there.
R:  Is she into refunding, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and coupons?
L:  Yep. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, when you have a chance to talk to her, tell her, tell her, if that's where she found it, you talked to a lady that also goes into chitchat.
L:  Excuse me?
R:  When you, ah, talk to your mom?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Tell her that you talked with a lady that also goes into chitchat, --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- on Refunding Makes Sense, if that's where she found it.
L:  Yeah, I know she goes in there, I don't know if that's where she heard about it or not, but I know she does go to that site, that Chitchat.
R:  Yeah, and how was your Memorial Day today?
L:  Nice.  It was a good day.
R:  You have a cookout?
L:  No, I took my daughter out.
R:  Go to -- I'm try to place Flagware Beach.
L:  It's just north of Daytona Beach, --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- between Daytona and Saint Augustine.
R:  I used to live in Saint Augustine.
L:  Did you?
R:  Mhm, a long time ago, maybe before you was even thought of.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH].  What area do you live in now, South Carolina?
R:  Ah, up in the mountains, a little town called Easely[?], right out of Greenwell, --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and I was born and raised here, and moved, traveled quite a bit and met my husband, when he retired, we decided to come back here.
L:  [LAUGH] I went to Charleston, around that area, a couple of years ago, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, like, that's a pretty area.
R:  Yeah, and did you go to Myrtle Beach, or any of the beaches up here?
L:  No, I didn't.
R:  They aren't anywhere near as nice as some of the Florida beaches, but -- but they're nice, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, --
