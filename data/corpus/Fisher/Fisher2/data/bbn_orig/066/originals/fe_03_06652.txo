R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.  Sharon from Maryland.
R:  Hi.  My name is Jamica and I'm from Indiana. 
L:  Oh, very good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  How did you find out about this?
R:  Um, I -- I found it online, actually.
L:  Oh, okay.   I subscribe to a site called, uh, "Refunding Makes Sense" and uh, I'm just trying to see if we -- if I have any other Refunding Makes Sense people on here.
R:  No.  [LAUGH].
L:  Um, do you exercise regularly?
R:  Um, I used to and I stopped.
L:  Did you?
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's usually the way it works.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Are you in school now or --
R:  Yes, I am.  Mhm.
L:  You go to college or -- 
R:  I'm in college, yeah.
L:  Oh, very good.  Um, well, you're probably busy with school work and other things, boys and stuff.
R:  That's true.  [LAUGH].  
L:  Sorority, fraternities, all that other good stuff.
R:  [LAUGH].  Do you exercise regularly?
L:  Um, I am probably clinically overweight.  Um --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- yeah, I actually have started as of -- I guess March and I have gone back to the gym and actually doing three to four times a week now.  I'm getting on the bicycle there and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they have this new elliptic -- I know I'm going to pronounce it wrong.  Elliptical trainer of some sort.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's kind of a cross between like a Step Master, but it's a lot easier on your knees and for us old people I guess.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  And uh, I'm actually doing pretty well.  I've lost about ten pounds, I guess.
R:  Wow, that's awesome.
L:  In a couple -- in a couple months here.  And I need a lot more to lose, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I guess I've had two babies and um, that um hasn't helped.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So you don't have to worry about any of that yet.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  But um, and uh, you know, working out with the weights and stuff.  See, I -- I'm getting there.  I'm trying to keep it up, but it is difficult.  It's a decision that, you know --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  -- there's so many other things that get in the way.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Obviously.  Um, you know, especially like I said, I have two young kids, so if anybody's sick at any given time, you know, forget it, you're --
R:  Right.
L:  That's -- and it's easy, too, like you said, to -- to slack off and not do it, and -- well, you're young enough, you know, you probably are -- you know, trim, you don't have to worry about that, but as you get older, your metabolism does slow --
R:  Yes.  Mhm.
L:  I don't know what -- if weight problems run in your family at all?
R:  Mhm.  Yeah --
L:  Huh?
R:  -- they do, actu- they do actually.
L:  Do they?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Um, you know, I know both sides of my family, you know, are -- my uncle has to have special chairs made for him 'cause he's so heavy.
R:  Really?
L:  Um, so that's something I want to definitely try to avoid and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just seeing that um -- but it's -- it is hard to do it on a regular basis, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, are -- are you -- um, you probably have a big camp- are you going to school on a big campus?
R:  Yeah.  It's a pretty big campus.  Mhm.
L:  So you get your exercise that way?
R:  Yeah, I do.  I mean, I -- I have to walk to class and stuff, and I mean, sometimes it can be up to a mile, um just --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- walking and so I mean, I -- I -- I guess I do get some exercise, but I mean, I -- I'd like to go jogging and things like that, but I really --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just don't have time.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  It's hard to -- it's hard to find time, but last summer, um, I was jogging every day.  I was jogging up to three miles a day.
L:  Wow.
R:  But you know, I didn't -- like, I'm not overweight, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I am in a pretty good weight, um, weight area, or weight class, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but -- so I didn't really lose anything, I didn't notice any difference other than my endurance went up and stuff and --
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- and then when it got cold and the fall started and classes started, I just sort of quit.  [LAUGH].
L:  Well, you're in Indiana.  You all have rough winters out there?
R:  Yes, very rough.
L:  Yeah?  So, that would do it.
R:  Very, very icy, yeah. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it's hard to get to the -- it's hard to get to the gym 'cause it's always really full of students and stuff.
L:  Right.
R:  So it's difficult.
L:  So you have one there on -- on campus?
R:  Yes, it's huge, but it's really busy.  You know, and it -- to me, it's just not worth it, waiting an hour and a half for a treadmill or something.
L:  No.
R:  So --
L:  No, it's more fun to run from dorm to dorm to the boys.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  There you go.  Um, yeah, I remember in college, that -- I think that was one of my biggest exercises, was lifting the pitcher up, I think.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  And pouring it.  Um, I'm sure if -- yeah, maybe you all are more sensible than we were, but --
R:  Mm.  Oh.
L:  -- there's a lot of parties, and running after all the boys, I'm sure --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- or running away from them, whichever one.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  You all do out there.  But um, so -- so it's that long for a wait for an exercise machine?
R:  Mhm.  
L:  Wow.
R:  So it's just not worth it.
L:  Is there any other, like, times that -- or like, less likely people go or --
R:  Um, us- just early in the morning.  I mean, that's -- that's usually the -- and it -- like, 'cause I sort of go in, I -- I figure, well, I start going in at like, nine PM, 'cause I figure no one would be there, but that's when everyone's there.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, so really I mean, if you -- if you -- if you want to do it, you have to get it when they first open and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I'm just too lazy to get up at five AM, so --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  No, no.  Especially when you're trying to study.  What kind of degree are you getting?
R:  A psychology degree.
L:  Oh, very exciting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  How many more years you have?
R:  Well, I'm graduating in a year and then, um, I'm going to go to grad school so I have an extra five.  [LAUGH].
L:  Wow.  Very good.  Well, but that'll -- you'll ha- you'll be very well educated, be able to hopefully, you know, either start your own practice or get a good --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, you know, very, very good job, too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that's important.  Education's important nowadays, because I tell you, your -- your -- I guess your competition --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, is so greater nowadays for jobs.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And stuff, so um, it sounds pretty amazing, but uh [MN] now, do you find -- do any of your friends, like, collect -- ever, say, exercise or go jogging or, like now is a good time.  You know?
R:  Yeah.  Uh, no.  [LAUGH].
L:  No?
R:  No.  Um, my best friend, she is very, very tiny.  She's really petite and she doesn't have to exercise and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, my boyfriend, he's -- he doesn't exercise either and he's just fine, but I mean, again, I mean, all of us are in school and you know, have to walk from one side of the campus to the other all the time, so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so we're always getting some -- some exercise then.
L:  Right.  I think our biggest -- is running after a child, trying to get a diaper on her.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  You know?  "No, quick".
R:  Oh.
L:  That's my -- my little ones, they're two and a half and four and a half.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And the two and a half year old does not like to wear her diaper, but still --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- hasn't got -- mastered the potty yet and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- nude is -- nude children around here are a big thing.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  So, trying to chase them down, that's -- that's -- I -- I consider that a form of exercise.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause that's really -- you know, I think that's one reason I want to exercise, is I need to have more energy for them.
R:  For them, yeah.
L:  They are just, you know -- my -- my two and a half year old, she's just on.
R:  Mhm.
L:  From the minute she wakes up to the minute she literally drops into bed.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, she is on and she needs to run and play and ru- you know --
R:  Right.  
L:  Especially -- we've had two weeks of rain now, so she's been going crazy and um but I think it's important, I know, especially um [SIGH] you know, I'm in -- in my forties now and it is --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- harder.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it -- and it has gradually gotten harder and I notice the big, um, when I hit thirty, you know, my metabolism shoving to a halt --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And um even more so which -- and I didn't think was possible. I think when I hit, like thirty nine, forty again, and um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, and just taking this much weight around, if -- if you have a weight problem in your family, you -- I guess you -- you know, your parents, your --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- your uncles or aunts or whatever --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it is -- it does get more difficult.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So you know, if you can do -- do it while you're young.
R:  That's what my mom says.  She --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- growing up, my parents never exercised and I mean, we are very big on, you know, big family meals with lots --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of fat in them and things like that and my mom, um, who was never really overweight, she just -- she started gaining a couple little pounds and decided she wanted to start exercising and she likes it now, but -- you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- she keeps telling me to, you know, to get started when I'm -- when I'm younger and just keep --
L:  [NOISE] mhm.
R:  -- you know, even if I don't need to, just keep up the habit and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I just saw her last weekend, she looks great, and she just walks every day.
L:  Well, you're too, as -- as -- you know, being younger, you have a obligation, like you know, all these belly shirts nowadays.  At least when I was growing up --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- you know, we didn't have to -- it seems like if you don't wear a belly shirt, you know, you're --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  So that's a lot of ab work, you know what I mean?  [LAUGH].
R:  That's true.  
L:  To -- to try to keep up with and stuff and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, you have your Janet Jackson, your Britney Spears, Christine Aguilara people who --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, you know, have set that trend.  I don't know if that's the style where you all are from, but you know, around here, it's thirty degrees and the girls just wearing --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- wearing them at the mall, you know.  I guess they have to do that.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  But, I'm like, I hope you wore a coat in here, because --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  But I think that puts even more pressure -- do you feel that pressure, to a certain degree?
R:  Absolutely.  Absolutely, and -- and I have kind of a curvy body --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- um, just genetically and so I mean, I can't really get away with that stuff, but I mean, there's definitely that pressure, yeah. 
L:  You know --
R:  To -- to have a six pack abs and -- and this, that and the other, and be real skinny --
L:  To have it -- yeah, well --
R:  -- and for some reason, really skinny is in right now, so --
L:  Yeah.  But that's a shame.  That's -- that's unfortunate because that's where a lot of the -- you know, especially kids your age get, uh, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, eating disorders and, you know, women your age do --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um I know when I -- when I -- when I was in college there was a girl, yeah, and she got -- you know, tried to throw herself up to death, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, you know, that wasn't working either.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, you know, you know, you want -- you need a little body fat on you, too, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  But, you know, there is that pressure, with all these -- how short skirts do have to go and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, but then if you hang in a group -- well, you said your best friend, she's a -- she's a skinny?
R:  She's very skinny, yes.
L:  And that -- she's just naturally that way?
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, and some people have that metabolism.  They can eat everything, anything in sight.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And um, you know, hang out at McDonalds every day or -- I don't know where you all hang out now, you know?  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  And uh, drink and have -- you know, have a good time and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's -- that's important too, but um --
