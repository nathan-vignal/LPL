AND THEY CAN'T HAVE IT AT AT HOME  (fe_03_06637-A-0009)
BUT THE SCHOOLS'LL LET THEM HAVE IT  (fe_03_06637-A-0010)
FOR MY KIDS I DON'T THINK THEY NEED TO HAVE THE LIKE THE LOVE STORIES THAT ARE EXPLICIT  (fe_03_06637-A-0011)
AND I DON'T LIKE THEM TO HAVE  (fe_03_06637-A-0012)
THE GANGSTER TYPE THINGS AND THEY'RE ALLOWED THESE THINGS AT SCHOOL  (fe_03_06637-A-0013)
WELL I'M NOT QUITE SURE THAT THERE'S A NECESSITY IN PUTTING I MEAN IF YOU WANT IF IF AND I KNOW WHO WHO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WITH MAYA ANGELOU IF UM  (fe_03_06637-A-0014)
IF A POINT NEEDS TO BE MADE I JUST I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE NECESSITY OF PUTTING IN THINGS THAT ARE SEXUALLY EXPLICIT OR OR OUTSIDE THE THE CONFINES OF MORALITY YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN  (fe_03_06637-A-0015)
BECAUSE WE'RE RAISING KIDS  (fe_03_06637-A-0016)

ONLY IN SCHOOLS YOU KNOW IF IF SHE'S WATCHING SOMETHING HERE AT HOME THAT'S UP TO US TO DECIDE BUT IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEMS I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO JUDGE WHAT'S OKAY AND WHAT'S MORAL FOR A CHILD THAT'S THAT'S EACH AND EVERY FAMILY'S  (fe_03_06637-A-0029)
YOU KNOW DECISION BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE LIVE IN A CULTURE THAT THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT MORALS  (fe_03_06637-A-0030)
