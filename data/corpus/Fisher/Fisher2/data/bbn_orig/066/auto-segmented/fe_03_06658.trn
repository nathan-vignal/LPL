WELL I GUESS YOU JUST REMINDED ME ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF COUNTING THOSE GLASSES OF WATER  (fe_03_06658-B-0040)

AND IT SOUNDS L- SOUNDS LIKE YOU I WOULD FEEL THE NEED TO BE WITH SOMEBODY I KNEW TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY KIND OF OF REGIMEN YOU KNOW ANY KIND OF A PROGRAM THAT  (fe_03_06658-B-0047)

I'M THINKING ABOUT GOING BACK TO WAITRESSING BECAUSE THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT YOU KNOW EXERCISE FOR ME BUT WHAT I HAVE A TENDENCY TO DO WHEN I'M WAITRESSING  (fe_03_06658-B-0066)
IS TO BULK UP I HAVE TOO BIG OF ARMS  (fe_03_06658-B-0067)
TOO BIG OF LEGS  (fe_03_06658-B-0068)
AND NOT NOTHING PROPORTIONATE TO WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE AND THEN IF I'M NOT WAITRESSING THEN IT'S FLABBY I FEEL YOU KNOW I FEEL  (fe_03_06658-B-0069)
