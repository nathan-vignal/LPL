I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS WITH YOU FITNESS AND EXERCISE  (fe_03_06656-A-0005)
AND DO YOU EXERCISE  (fe_03_06656-A-0006)
WELL THAT MAKES TWO OF US I TRY TO UM  (fe_03_06656-A-0007)
PART OF MY EXERCISE IS WALKING MY DOG  (fe_03_06656-A-0008)
I TRY TO DO THAT EVERY DAY  (fe_03_06656-A-0009)
BUT SHE HAS A PROBLEM RIGHT NOW WITH HER LEGS SO SHE'S TAKING  (fe_03_06656-A-0010)
ASPIRIN FOR ARTHRITIS  (fe_03_06656-A-0011)
SO SHE DOESN'T REALLY WANT TO GO EVERY DAY SO NOW I NEED SOMETHING TO  (fe_03_06656-A-0012)
GIVE ME INCENTIVE TO KEEP DOING THAT  (fe_03_06656-A-0013)
SO AND THE OTHER THING I DO UM  (fe_03_06656-A-0014)
I WORK IN MY YARD A LOT I HAVE A BIG LARD YARD  (fe_03_06656-A-0015)
AND I CUT GRASS AND OF COURSE PLANT FLOWERS ESPECIALLY NOW  (fe_03_06656-A-0016)
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD BE INCENTIVE FOR YOU TO EXERCISE  (fe_03_06656-A-0017)
ABSOLUTELY I THINK THE WEATHER HAS A LOT TO DO WITH IT  (fe_03_06656-A-0019)
UM  (fe_03_06656-A-0020)
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED I USED TO BELONG TO A SPA  (fe_03_06656-A-0021)
AND I FOUND IT TOO EXPENSIVE SO  (fe_03_06656-A-0022)
I BOUGHT MYSELF A MACHINE THAT I EXERCISE WITH SIT-UPS  (fe_03_06656-A-0023)
YEAH AND IT'S TOUGH YOU  (fe_03_06656-A-0024)
AND IT'S TOUGH TO DO IT ON A DAILY BASIS AGAIN IT'S ALMOST LIKE YOU NEED SOMEONE TO SAY HEY GET ON WITH THAT EXERCISE YOU KNOW [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06656-A-0025)
AND UH SO DO YOU DO ANY DO YOU USE ANY EQUIPMENT AT ALL  (fe_03_06656-A-0026)
WALKING IS ONE OF THE BEST EXERCISES THERE IS  (fe_03_06656-A-0027)
I MY DAUGHTER  (fe_03_06656-A-0028)
UH STARTED WALKING  (fe_03_06656-A-0029)
AT LEAST TWO MILES SHE TRIES TO DO IT EVERY DAY AND HONESTLY SHE UH SHE IT AMAZES ME SHE VER- VERY RARELY MISSES  (fe_03_06656-A-0030)

YOU KNOW FORTY HOURS A WEEK  (fe_03_06656-A-0033)
SO IT AMAZES ME THAT SHE DID FIT THIS INTO HER SCHEDULE I THINK ONCE YOU HAVE A ROUTINE IF YOU WOULD  (fe_03_06656-A-0034)
DO IT ON A DAILY BASIS EVEN IF YOU JUST GO ONE MILE A DAY AND BUILD IT UP MAYBE A MILE AND A HALF  (fe_03_06656-A-0035)
AND MAKE YOURSELF GO AT A CERTAIN TIME  (fe_03_06656-A-0036)
I THINK IT REALLY HELPS  (fe_03_06656-A-0037)
OH ABSOLUTELY THAT'S THE ONLY WAY IT'LL WORK AND EVEN WITH THAT MACHINE I HAVE IT'S  (fe_03_06656-A-0038)
IT'S NOT A COMFORTABLE MACHINE  (fe_03_06656-A-0039)
SO I DON'T EVEN RECOMMEND EQUIPMENT MY DAUGHTER HAS EQUIPMENT BUT SHE'S DONE SO MUCH BETTER JUST WALKING  (fe_03_06656-A-0040)
