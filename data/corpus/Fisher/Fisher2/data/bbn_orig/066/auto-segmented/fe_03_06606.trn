OH NO THEY SHOULDN'T BE READING THIS THIS IS THIS IS INAPPROPRIATE ALTHOUGH IT WAS WITH A SMALL GROUP OF CHILDREN BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THOSE GIFTED PROGRAMS SO  (fe_03_06606-A-0053)

RIGHT AND A LITTLE BIT MORE  (fe_03_06606-A-0055)
ADVANCED READING NOT MATURE READING BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE EXPOSED TO MORE DOESN'T MAKE THEM MORE MATURE BUT A LITTLE BIT MORE ADVANCED READING WITH HEAVIER TOPICS SO  (fe_03_06606-A-0056)
