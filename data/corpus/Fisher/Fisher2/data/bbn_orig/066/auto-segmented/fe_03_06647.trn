PUSH CERTAIN BELIEFS ON PEOPLE THEN  (fe_03_06647-B-0013)

WELL YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK THAT CHILDREN SHOULD BE FORCED TO READ  (fe_03_06647-B-0019)
CERTAIN BOOKS  (fe_03_06647-B-0020)
I THINK THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE THE CHOICE NOT TO READ CERTAIN BOOKS OR THEIR PARENTS  (fe_03_06647-B-0021)
HAVE THE  (fe_03_06647-B-0022)
UM  (fe_03_06647-B-0023)

IF YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR CHILDREN UNTIL THEY'RE ADULTS  (fe_03_06647-B-0037)
AND YOU THINK THAT PART OF THEIR RAISING SHOULD BE  (fe_03_06647-B-0038)
EXCLUSIVE OF CERTAIN MATERIALS YOU THINK WILL  (fe_03_06647-B-0039)
NOT BE TO THEIR BENEFIT I THINK THAT  (fe_03_06647-B-0040)
YOU KNOW THERE SHOULD BE ANOTHER OPTION  (fe_03_06647-B-0041)
SO YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW SHOULD THE SCHOOL SAY NO YOU DON'T  (fe_03_06647-B-0042)
IF YOUR PARENTS THINK YOU SHOULDN'T READ THAT BOOK YOU DON'T HAVE TO READ THAT BOOK YOU CAN DO SOME ALTERNATE WORK  (fe_03_06647-B-0043)
I DON'T THINK THIS BOOK WAS JUST OVER THE TOP  (fe_03_06647-B-0046)
