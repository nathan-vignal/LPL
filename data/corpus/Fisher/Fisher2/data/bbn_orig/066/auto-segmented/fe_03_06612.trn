SO WHEN I BEGIN READING THE STORY YOU MAY JUST GO TO THE LIBRARY WILL HE DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO THE LIBRARY HE WANTED TO HEAR THE STORY SO HE AND HIS MOTHER HAD A ROUNDABOUT AND HE STAYED AND LISTENED TO THE STORY [LAUGHTER] SHE ALLOWED HIM TO BUT BUT THE TEACHER SAID IT WAS HIS DECISION  (fe_03_06612-B-0062)
SHE WASN'T GOING TO SAY YOU HAVE TO LEAVE GOING TO SAY YOU HAVE TO STAY IT'S HIS DECISION THAT WAY  (fe_03_06612-B-0063)
