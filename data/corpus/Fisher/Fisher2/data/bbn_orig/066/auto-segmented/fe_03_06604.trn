A LOT OF IT EXTENDS INTO RELIGION AND AND VIOLENCE A LOT OF IT  (fe_03_06604-B-0043)
AND UM  (fe_03_06604-B-0044)
LIKE  (fe_03_06604-B-0045)
TO TO EXTENT INTO RELIGION FIRST OF ALL AGAIN VIOLATES THE CONSTITUTION SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATES BUT FURTHER  (fe_03_06604-B-0046)
UM  (fe_03_06604-B-0047)
IT VIOLATES ANOTHER THING THAT WAS CENSORED IS  (fe_03_06604-B-0048)
YOU KNOW OF MICE AND MEN  (fe_03_06604-B-0049)
UM  (fe_03_06604-B-0050)
UNTIL THEY THEY CHOOSE TO TO FURTHER  (fe_03_06604-B-0051)
IT'S YOUR CHOICE ON WHAT YOU READ IT'S ALSO THE SAME CHOICE ON WHAT YOU WATCH ON TELEVISION  (fe_03_06604-B-0052)
SO UNTIL THEY THEY FURTHER CENSOR WHAT YOU CAN WATCH ON T. V I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO A LOT BETTER JOB  (fe_03_06604-B-0053)
BUT BUT A LOT BETTER JOB WITH T._V. BEFORE THEY CAN SELECT WHAT THEY WANT TO DO ON T._V. OR IN IN READING  (fe_03_06604-B-0054)
THAT'S TRUE  (fe_03_06604-B-0055)
DO YOU THINK UM  (fe_03_06604-B-0056)
DO YOU THINK PEOPLE ACTUALLY MIMIC WHAT THEY READ AND THAT THERE COULD BE SOMETHING RIGHT IN CENSORSHIP  (fe_03_06604-B-0058)
MHM  (fe_03_06604-B-0059)

SO I PLAYED DEVIL'S ADVOCATE HERE  (fe_03_06604-B-0063)
I I THINK WE GIVE OR I'M GIVING WAY TOO MUCH BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT TO THE HUMAN POPULATION I GO TO NORTH WESTERN I'M AROUND VERY EDUCATED PEOPLE  (fe_03_06604-B-0064)
UM  (fe_03_06604-B-0065)

WHO CAN'T SEPARATE BETWEEN LIKE I GUESS RIGHT AND WRONG OR REALITY AND FICTION  (fe_03_06604-B-0068)
SO I MEAN  (fe_03_06604-B-0069)
PERHAPS IT THERE IS SOME  (fe_03_06604-B-0070)
THERE IS SOME SENSIBILITY IN RESTRICTING IN PEOPLE'S READINGS LIKE  (fe_03_06604-B-0071)
I GUESS  (fe_03_06604-B-0072)
IN TERMS OF NOT READING BUT EVEN MOVIES DO YOU REMEMBER THAT MOVIE THE PLAYERS SEVERAL YEARS AGO  (fe_03_06604-B-0073)
WHERE THEY HAVE THE SCENE OF PEOPLE PLAYING UNDER CARS  (fe_03_06604-B-0074)

AND UM MAYBE THEY THEY NEED TO BE RESTRICTED BOTH NEED TO BE RESTRICTED  (fe_03_06604-B-0077)
THAT'S AN INTERESTING PERSPECTIVE  (fe_03_06604-B-0078)
THAT'S VERY INTERESTING PERSPECTIVE I KIND OF AGREE WITH THAT I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA  (fe_03_06604-B-0079)
