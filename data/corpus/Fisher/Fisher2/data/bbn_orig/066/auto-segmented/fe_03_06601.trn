HELLO  (fe_03_06601-A-0001)
I'M BEVERLY  (fe_03_06601-A-0002)
NICE TO MEET YOU TOO  (fe_03_06601-A-0003)
WHETHER SCHOOLS BE CENSORING BOOKS WELL I HAD AN EXPERIENCE WITH THAT I TAUGHT AT A PRIVATE SCHOOL  (fe_03_06601-A-0004)
AND IT WAS A REAL UNCOMFORTABLE SITUATION THESE WERE EIGHT GRADERS WHO HAD CHOSEN A BOOK YOU KNOW ONE OF THEIR CLASSMATES HAD READ IT AND SHE REALLY LIKED IT I LOOKED IT OVER I FELT IT WAS SUITABLE  (fe_03_06601-A-0005)
AND THE PRINCIPAL GOT VERY UPSET  (fe_03_06601-A-0006)
IT HAD A LITTLE BIT MORE SEX AND DRUGS IN IT THAN THE PRINCIPAL THOUGHT WAS JUST NOT ACCEPTABLE BUT THESE ARE URBAN CHILDREN AGE THIRTEEN TO FIFTEEN AND THEY PROBABLY KNEW MORE THAN WHAT WAS IN THOSE BOOKS  (fe_03_06601-A-0007)
SO IT BECAME A PRETTY BIG ISSUE AND ENDED UP TELLING THE CHILDREN THEY COULDN'T DO ANY REPORTS ON IT IT DIDN'T STOP THEM FROM READING THE BOOK  (fe_03_06601-A-0008)
IF ANY THING THEY JUST WENT UNDERGROUND WITH IT  (fe_03_06601-A-0009)
YES  (fe_03_06601-A-0010)
OH I KNOW THAT STAGE YEAH  (fe_03_06601-A-0012)
NOW THAT'S ONE OF THE BOOKS THAT'S COME UP YOU KNOW THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN THIS QUESTION IN CHRISTIAN SCHOOLS WHETHER OR NOT HARRY POTTER WAS SUITABLE  (fe_03_06601-A-0013)
EXACTLY THEY HAVEN'T TAKEN THE TIME TO THE FIND OUT JUST WHAT'S IN THE BOOKS BUT SOMEONE TOLD THEM THIS IS THE PROBLEM  (fe_03_06601-A-0014)
YES  (fe_03_06601-A-0015)
MHM  (fe_03_06601-A-0016)
YOU KNOW WHEN TEACH YOUR CHILDREN WITH THE WHOLE THOUGHT OF OKAY YOU'RE GOING TO FIND THINGS THAT DON'T MATCH TO WHAT YOU KNOW OF  (fe_03_06601-A-0017)
BUT LEARN ABOUT THEM AND THEN REMEMBER THAT  (fe_03_06601-A-0018)
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING THAT YOU READ  (fe_03_06601-A-0019)
AND I MEAN THAT'S ONE OF THE THINKS WHEN I HAD TO GO THROUGH IT WITH MY PRINCIPAL AND I HAD TO KEEP REMINDING HER THAT THESE CHILDREN ARE NOT AS INNOCENT AS WE WERE AT THAT AGE YOU  (fe_03_06601-A-0020)
KNOW THESE CHILDREN ARE OUT THERE DOING THINGS THAT WE REALLY WISH WE DIDN'T HAVE TO KNOW ABOUT  (fe_03_06601-A-0021)
YOU KNOW AND THEY FEED TO KNOW THEY CAN COME SOMEWHERE AND TALK ABOUT THIS STUFF  (fe_03_06601-A-0022)
PARENTS ARE WORKING YOU KNOW TWO ORE THREE JOBS THEY DON'T HAVE TIME  (fe_03_06601-A-0023)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_06601-A-0024)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06601-A-0025)
MHM  (fe_03_06601-A-0026)
THAT'S RIDICULOUS TO ME  (fe_03_06601-A-0027)
EXACTLY NOW WHERE ELSE CAN YOU DISCUSS THESE THINGS  (fe_03_06601-A-0028)
LITERATURE IS SUCH A GOOD WAY TO OPEN CHILDREN'S MINDS AND I'D RATHER HAVE A BOOK IN FRONT OF A CHILD AND GET A CHILD TO TALK ABOUT IT THAN HAVE THEM TELL ME SOMETHING THEY SAW ON ONE OF THESE TALK SHOWS  (fe_03_06601-A-0029)
AND UNFORTUNATELY THESE TALK SHOWS ARE BECOMING THE TOUCHSTONE FOR THESE CHILDREN YOU KNOW THEY'RE CONSTANTLY TALKING ABOUT OH I SAW THIS AND I WAS THAT AND IS IT OKAY FOR US TO DO THESE THINGS  (fe_03_06601-A-0030)
YOU KNOW I MEAN I'D MUCH RATHER TAKE IT OUT OF A BOOK SO WE CAN SIT DOWN AND REALLY ANALYZE IT THESE TALK SHOWS ARE RIDICULOUS  (fe_03_06601-A-0031)
THAT'S TRUE BUT THEN AT SOME POINT YOU KNOW YOU'LL GET TO THE AGE WHERE MAYBE THE FRIENDS ARE LOOKING AT SOMETHING  (fe_03_06601-A-0032)
OH YES  (fe_03_06601-A-0033)
OH MY GOODNESS MHM WELL THE FIRST YEAR THAT SOUTH PARK STARTED I HAD AN  (fe_03_06601-A-0034)

I I WAS SO UNDER THE DESK LAUGHING  (fe_03_06601-A-0036)
I ASKED HER DID SHE ACTUALLY WATCH THE WHOLE THING AND SHE SAID OH NO I WAS GETTING READY FOR BED AND I'M THINKING AND YOUR EIGHT YEAR OLD IS SITTING THERE WITH HIS EYE BALLS GLUED OPEN  (fe_03_06601-A-0037)
WATCHING THIS AND COMING TO SCHOOL THE NEXT DAY QUOTING IT NO LADY WATCH THE SHOW [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06601-A-0038)
OH BUT SHE THOUGHT BECAUSE SHE SAW ANIMATION  (fe_03_06601-A-0039)
YOU KNOW OH THIS IS WONDERFUL SWEETIE THIS IS NOT YOU KNOW MICKEY MOUSE  (fe_03_06601-A-0040)
OH BUT THESE ARE THE SAME PARENTS THAT WOULD RAISE ALL KINDS OF NOISE IF YOU HAVE THEM READING A BOOK THEY MIGHT HAVE THE WORD DAMN IN IT  (fe_03_06601-A-0041)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_06601-A-0042)
MHM WE ALWAYS HAD A WAY OF FINDING BOOKS THAT YOU KNOW THERE WAS NO WAY YOU WOULD FIND IN THE SCHOOL LIBRARY  (fe_03_06601-A-0043)
MY MOTHER HAD HER STASH UNDER THE BED AND WHEN SHE WASN'T HOME I'D FISH THEM OUT AND I KNEW HOW TO PUT THEM BACK EXACTLY THE WAY SHE DID IT  (fe_03_06601-A-0044)
I'VE SEEN MY STUDENTS DO THE SAME THING  (fe_03_06601-A-0045)
I HAD A FOURTH GRADER WHO CAME TO SCHOOL WITH HIS FATHER'S COPIES OF PLAYBOY  (fe_03_06601-A-0046)
AND I'M I WAS READY TO HIT THE ROOF  (fe_03_06601-A-0047)
YOU KNOW HE HAD A FOLDER FULL OF THEM AND HE SAID OH WELL DADDY SAID THESE ARE GOOD FOR YOUNG BOYS  (fe_03_06601-A-0048)
AND I'M SAYING YOUNG BOY AT WHAT AGE SIXTEEN  (fe_03_06601-A-0049)
YOU KNOW BUT THE BOY WAS LIKE WELL DADDY IT SAID WAS OKAY AND I SAID LET ME SPEAK TO YOUR FATHER YOU KNOW SAID NO NO NO DADDY DID NOT KNOW THOSE BOOKS LEFT THE HOUSE AND HE WAS VERY EMBARRASSED  (fe_03_06601-A-0050)
NO OF COURSE WE LAUGHED ABOUT IT FOR MONTHS AFTERWARDS BUT YOU SEE YOU HIDE STUFF AND THE KIDS FIND IT  (fe_03_06601-A-0051)
OH OF COURSE I MEAN THAT LINE DIDN'T EVEN WORK WHEN I GREW UP  (fe_03_06601-A-0052)
MHM  (fe_03_06601-A-0053)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06601-A-0054)
I KNOW THEY'RE PICKING THESE THINGS UP EARLIER AND EARLIER  (fe_03_06601-A-0055)
THEY DO  (fe_03_06601-A-0056)
BUT IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A CONCERN ABOUT WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF MORALS WOULD THEY COME ACROSS IN SCHOOL AND I THINK THAT'S PART OF TRUSTING THAT THE TEACHER IS GOING TO KNOW HOW TO HANDLE THIS  (fe_03_06601-A-0057)
I MEAN I DON'T SEE ANY TEACHER THAT I'VE EVER KNOWN COMING IN THERE WITH AN ATTITUDE OH WELL THE KIDS CAN READ ANYTHING THEY WANT AND  (fe_03_06601-A-0058)
LET ME LET THEM KNOW THAT EVERYTHING IS FINE  (fe_03_06601-A-0059)
ALL OF US HAVE ALWAYS HAD THIS THING ABOUT CONCERN THE CHILDREN CAN PUT THESE THINGS INTO PERSPECTIVE  (fe_03_06601-A-0060)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_06601-A-0062)
THAT'S RIGHT  (fe_03_06601-A-0063)
AND THE CHILDREN LEARN VERY QUICKLY THAT THESE PARENTS ALL JUST PLAYING THE GAME  (fe_03_06601-A-0064)
AND THEN THEY JUST GO OFF ON THE SIDE AND DO WHATEVER THEY WANT TO DO AND JUST MAKE SURE THAT NOBODY KNOWS AT ALL  (fe_03_06601-A-0065)
AND INVARIABLY IT WILL COME OUT AT SOME POINT SOME CHILD'S GOING TO MAKE A STATEMENT IN THE WRONG PLACE AND THEN THE WHOLE THING COMES OUT OH YEAH MY MOTHER WON'T LET ME DO THIS BUT  (fe_03_06601-A-0066)
OH YEAH YOU KNOW YOU JUST HOPE THAT THEY'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING ILLEGAL  (fe_03_06601-A-0067)
NOW THINGS CAN GET SO SCARY WITH CHILDREN  (fe_03_06601-A-0068)
KNOW MY SON IS TWENTY SEVEN AND I JUST HELD MY BREATH THROUGH HIS TEENAGE YEARS  (fe_03_06601-A-0070)
YOU KNOW WHATEVER I DON'T WANT HIM INTO ANY CRAZINESS I JUST HAD A TALK TO HIM AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE  (fe_03_06601-A-0071)
YEAH AND THE WAY IT IS TRUE BECAUSE IF YOU TALK ABOUT THINGS WITH YOUR CHILDREN MOST LIKELY THEY WON'T FEEL OH WELL YEAH I'M DOING THIS AND NOBODY KNOWS NOBODY CARES  (fe_03_06601-A-0072)
BUT THEN YOU'VE ALSO GOT CHILDREN THAT WILL SIT THERE SMILE IN YOUR FACE AND TELL YOU WANT YOUR WANT HEAR  (fe_03_06601-A-0073)
