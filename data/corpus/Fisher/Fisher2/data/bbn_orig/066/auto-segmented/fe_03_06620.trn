I I MEAN LITTLE KIDS ARE NOT GOING TO GO ASTRAY 'CAUSE THEY DON'T YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT AT THAT LEVEL YET  (fe_03_06620-A-0055)
AND I DON'T KNOW IF THIS QUESTION IS POINTED UM YOU KNOW STRICTLY AT HIGH SCHOOL KIDS YOU KNOW HIGH SCHOOL KIDS  (fe_03_06620-A-0056)

AND WHETHER THEY AGREE WITH IT OR DON'T AGREE WITH IT WILL DEPEND ON WHAT THEY DO LATER ON IN LIFE  (fe_03_06620-A-0064)

I I AGREE WITH YOU GENERALLY  (fe_03_06620-B-0005)
UM  (fe_03_06620-B-0006)
FOR PE- KIDS IN HIGH SCHOOL I MEAN IN A WAY IT'S VERY HARD TO SAY YOU CANNOT CENSOR BECAUSE  (fe_03_06620-B-0007)
IT'S EASY TO CENSOR JUST BY NOT BUYING THE BOOK OR HAVING IT IN THE LIBRARY DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN  (fe_03_06620-B-0008)
IF YOU CAN'T FORCE SOMEONE TO BUY A BOOK DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN  (fe_03_06620-B-0010)
BUT  (fe_03_06620-B-0011)
I FEEL THAT ONCE IT'S IN THE LIBRARY I- IT OUGHT TO BE AVAILABLE BUT I MEAN IF I WAS IF I AS A PARENT WHICH I'M NOT BUT AS A PARENT UM THERE'S CERTAIN BOOKS I WOULDN'T WANT MY KIDS TO READ AT A CERTAIN AGE  (fe_03_06620-B-0012)
MY MY I TEND TO BE KIND OF UM [LIPSMACK]  (fe_03_06620-B-0013)
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE WORD IS BUT I FEEL WHILE THEY'RE LIVING IN THE HOUSE THERE'S CERTAIN RULES  (fe_03_06620-B-0014)
AND  (fe_03_06620-B-0015)
THERE'S CERTAIN BOOKS I WOULD DISCOURAGE THEM TO READ AT CERTAIN TIMES  (fe_03_06620-B-0016)
THEY CAN READ ANYTHING THEY WANT YOU KNOW ONCE THEY'RE NOT AT HOME  (fe_03_06620-B-0017)
I THERE'S CERTAIN MATERIAL I DON'T THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO READ IT AT A CERTAIN TIME BUT ON THE OTHER HAND SOME OF THAT MATERIAL YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG ANYWAYS [LAUGHTER] I MEAN YOU REALLY  (fe_03_06620-B-0018)
YEAH I MEAN YOU I MEAN I CAN RECALL READING SOME SOME MATERIAL IT HAD A LOT OF SEXUAL CONTENT AND I REALLY COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY WERE DOING WHEN I WAS TEN SO IT IT IT YOU CANNOT SAY IT AH HAD A BAD EFFECT ON ME  (fe_03_06620-B-0019)
WELL WHAT EL- WHAT I REALLY DON'T LIKE IS THE BOOK IS IN THE LIBRARY AND THEN SOMETHING HAPPENS OUTSIDE IN THE REAL WORLD AND THEY DECIDE THEY HAVE TO YANK IT OFF THE SHELF NOT THAT TO ME THAT'S ABSURD I I I CAN'T SEE THAT AT ALL  (fe_03_06620-B-0020)
AH BECAUSE BECAUSE THEN YOU'RE REALLY AT THE MERCY OF  (fe_03_06620-B-0021)
AH TRENDS OR FADS OR HYSTERIA YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06620-B-0022)
IF THERE IF THERE WAS A REASON TO BUY THE BOOK IN THE FIRST PLACE THEN THERE'S PROBABLY GOOD REASON IT SHOULD STILL BE READ THE ONES THAT THEY USUALLY YANK ARE THE ONES THAT ARE MOST RELEVANT TO SOMETHING THAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE ACTUAL WORLD  (fe_03_06620-B-0023)
AND THAT'S THE KIND OF INFORMATION I THINK A STUDENT WOULD REALLY NEED PLUS  (fe_03_06620-B-0024)
NOWADAYS IT'S THIS IS ALMOST A MOOT POINT I MEAN IF THE KIDS CAN GET ON THE INTERNET AT HOME AND THEY DON'T HAVE SOME KIND OF BLOCK OR THING ON IT I MEAN GOD KNOWS THERE'S A HELL OF A LOT MORE THERE THAT MIGHT BE QUESTIONABLE MATERIAL THAN WHAT'S GOING TO END UP IN A  (fe_03_06620-B-0025)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06620-B-0027)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06620-B-0028)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06620-B-0029)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06620-B-0030)
Y- YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT BOTHERS ME ABOUT THIS QUESTION TOO IS  (fe_03_06620-B-0031)
I ALMOST FEEL LIKE IT'S  (fe_03_06620-B-0033)
IT'S TOO OLD OF A QUESTION IN THE SENSE THAT TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO  (fe_03_06620-B-0034)
THIS WAS V- THIS WAS A WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT QUESTION BUT BASED ON WHAT YOU JUST SAID WHICH I AGREE WITH WHICH IS KIDS CAN NOW GET THEIR HANDS ON ANYTHING  (fe_03_06620-B-0035)
AH BY VIA THE INTERNET OR ALMOST ALL CHILDREN HAVE AN ALLOWANCE OF SOME KIND NOW  (fe_03_06620-B-0036)
THEY HAVE A LOT MORE FREEDOM AND LESS PARENTAL WHATEVER OVERVIEW THAN BEFORE WHICH IS GOOD AND BAD  (fe_03_06620-B-0037)
AH SO THE THE ROLE OF THE LIBRARY IN SCHOOL IS NOT AS CENTRAL ANY MORE  (fe_03_06620-B-0038)
UNLESS THEY REALLY LIVE LIVE IN A FAR OUT WHERE THERE IS NO LIBRARY  (fe_03_06620-B-0039)
BUT YOU KNOW FRANKLY I WAS RAISED IN A VERY RURAL TOWN I THINK IT WAS ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE BUT WE HAD A LIBRARY BESIDES THE SCHOOL LIBRARY  (fe_03_06620-B-0040)
AND IT HAD INTER LIBRARY LOANS  (fe_03_06620-B-0041)
YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06620-B-0042)
AND THAT LIBRARY AND ACTUALLY HAD A SAFE FULL OF BOOKS THAT SHE THOUGHT WERE TOO WICKED  (fe_03_06620-B-0043)
FOR ANYBODY TO READ BUT SHE WOULDN'T THROW THEM OUT  (fe_03_06620-B-0044)
[LAUGHTER] SO SO ANYWAY THE ROLE AS A A PRESERVER OF BOOKS KINDA CONFLICTED WITH WHATEVER HER MORAL CODE WAS [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06620-B-0045)
AND THESE WERE ALL BOOKS THAT WERE LEGAL TO BE IN THE UNITED STATES I GUESS [LAUGHTER] BUT AT LEAST BY THAT POINT IN HISTORY  (fe_03_06620-B-0046)
SO UM  (fe_03_06620-B-0047)
I ALMOST FEEL THE THE THE THE TOPIC IS KINDA MOOT AT THIS POINT BASED ON A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT YOU SAID  (fe_03_06620-B-0048)
UM  (fe_03_06620-B-0049)
RIGHT AND YOU WANTED TO BE SEEN ON TELEVISION FOR GOD'S SAKE A BOOK THE MEDIUM ITSELF ALLOWS YOU TO STOP AND REFLECT  (fe_03_06620-B-0050)
AND GO BACK AND REREAD YOU KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING  (fe_03_06620-B-0051)
AND AND IT'S ALMOST WE'RE NOW AT THE POINT WHERE I SHOULD THINK  (fe_03_06620-B-0052)
THAT THE SCHOOLS WOULD WANT TO ENCOURAGE READING AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE INSTEAD OF DISCOURAGING READING OF CERTAIN BOOKS  (fe_03_06620-B-0053)
I LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY  (fe_03_06620-B-0054)
AND WE HAVE A BAD SITUATION HERE WELL [MN] NOT UNLIKE ANY OTHER CITY WITH THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND A LOT OF THEM DON'T HAVE BOOKS I MEAN LIKE A LIBRARY  (fe_03_06620-B-0055)
ESPECIALLY IN THE LOWER GRADES  (fe_03_06620-B-0056)
SO THIS WHOLE THING ABOUT CENSORSHIP I MEAN HERE WE HAVE PARENTS HAVING BAKE SALES AND WHATNOT TO BUY BOOKS  (fe_03_06620-B-0057)
FOR THE CLASSROOMS TH- SO THE KIDS CAN READ THEM  (fe_03_06620-B-0058)
I MEAN SO  (fe_03_06620-B-0059)
THE THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF LIKE YANKING BOOKS OUT [LAUGHTER] IT IT DOESN'T I- I- IT'S BASED ON SOME UM  (fe_03_06620-B-0060)
AH A SCENARIO WHICH SADLY IS NO LONGER VERY PREVALENT WHERE YOU HAVE THE LUXURY OF MANY BOOKS AND THERE'S SOME YOU'VE GONNA TAKE YOU YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN  (fe_03_06620-B-0061)
I REALISE THAT DOES HAPPEN ONE HEARS IT ABOUT IT ON THE NEWS AND AND I I I GENERALLY DON'T LIKE IT I DON'T AH  (fe_03_06620-B-0062)
YES  (fe_03_06620-B-0063)
[MN] YEAH RIGHT ALMOST ANYTHING  (fe_03_06620-B-0065)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06620-B-0066)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06620-B-0067)
AH  (fe_03_06620-B-0068)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_06620-B-0069)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_06620-B-0070)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06620-B-0071)
TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO READ  (fe_03_06620-B-0072)
NO  (fe_03_06620-B-0073)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06620-B-0074)
BUT THE THING TOO IS A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT IF THEY'RE REALLY TRYING TO READ WHAT SOMEONE ELSE MAY THINK IS A WICKED BOOK IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING OUT AND AND AS A GENERAL HABIT I THINK THAT OUGHT TO BE ENCOURAGED DO YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06620-B-0075)
THAT DO WE HAVE SOMETHING YOU'RE INTERESTED IN AND YOU WANNA FIND OUT MORE MORE ABOUT IT I MEAN  (fe_03_06620-B-0076)
I CAN'T THINK OF TOO MANY CATEGORIES OF BOOKS THAT YOU'D WANNA CENSOR ANYWAY MA- MAYBE 'CAUSE A THEY HAVE SEXUAL CONTENT OR PICTURES RIGHT OKAY  (fe_03_06620-B-0077)
WHICH WELL I WON'T GO INTO THAT BUT THEN THE OR THE OTHER THING IS AH CERTAIN IDEAS WHICH I'M REALLY AGAINST CENSORING  (fe_03_06620-B-0078)
THAT'S RIGHT I MEAN AH  (fe_03_06620-B-0079)
RIGHT I I UM  (fe_03_06620-B-0080)
THE THE YOU KNOW TH- THE THE WHOLE THING ABOUT  (fe_03_06620-B-0081)
[LIPSMACK] THE THING IS TOO WHEN BOOKS ARE CENSORED  (fe_03_06620-B-0082)
WHO IS DETERMINING THIS THAT'S ANOTHER QUESTION WHO DETERMINES WHAT BOOKS GET YANKED  (fe_03_06620-B-0083)
I- IS IT THE SCHOOL BOARD AND BECAUSE WHAT AH FROM WHAT I'VE OBSERVED USUALLY A CLIQUE GETS IN A BEE IN THEIR BONNET THAT SOMETHING IS BAD AND HAS TO BE TAKEN OUT  (fe_03_06620-B-0084)
AND THEN YOU KNOW THEY GO AND THEY BEAT EVERYONE ELSE'S EAR 'TIL THEY THEY DO IT TO SHUT THEM UP BUT I MEAN WHO WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE THEY'RE CERTAINLY ENTITLED TO THEIR VIEW AND THEY'RE ENTITLED TO MAKE IT KNOWN AND TRY TO E- EFFECT A CHANGE IF THEY REALLY THINK THAT'S WHAT OUGHT TO BE DONE  (fe_03_06620-B-0085)
TO DO THAT IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL I DON'T LIKE IT I MEAN IF YOU WANT TO FORBID YOUR KIDS TO READ SOMETHING  (fe_03_06620-B-0087)
