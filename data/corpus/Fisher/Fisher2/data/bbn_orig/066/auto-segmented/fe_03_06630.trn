IT WAS UM DOES PRIVATE AND PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS HAVE THE RIGHT TO LIMIT THE B-  (fe_03_06630-B-0010)
THE BOOKS  (fe_03_06630-B-0011)
THAT THE CHILDREN CAN READ UM  (fe_03_06630-B-0012)
MEANING LIKE UH THE TYPES OF BOOKS  (fe_03_06630-B-0013)
I I THINK WHAT THEY'RE REFERRING TO IS UM CONTENT  (fe_03_06630-B-0014)
YOU KNOW ARE SOME BOOKS INAPPROPRIATE  (fe_03_06630-B-0015)
TO BE READ UH BY SUBJECT MATTER  (fe_03_06630-B-0016)
WELL I I THINK IT'S MORE LIKE WELL YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT GOING TO STOCK THIS CERTAIN BOOK IN THIS LIBRARY BECAUSE WE DON'T THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE  (fe_03_06630-B-0017)
AH SO I THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH MAYBE  (fe_03_06630-B-0018)
AH THE SUBJECT OF FREEDOM OF UM FREEDOM OF SPEECH MAYBE OR FREEDOM OF THE PRESS OR  (fe_03_06630-B-0019)
UM  (fe_03_06630-B-0020)
AND YOU KNOW I GUESS WHETHER OR NOT THERE SHOULD BE BOOKS OF UM MAYBE RELIGIOUS CONTENT IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS  (fe_03_06630-B-0021)
UM  (fe_03_06630-B-0022)
I PERSONALLY THINK THAT UM  (fe_03_06630-B-0023)
BECAUSE IT'S AH CHILDREN  (fe_03_06630-B-0024)
THAT YOU KNOW THERE PROBABLY ARE CERTAIN YOU KNOW UM  (fe_03_06630-B-0025)
MAYBE BOOKS THAT OH I CAN'T THINK OF ANY OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD BUT THERE ARE PROBABLY CERTAIN BOOKS THAT ARE INAPPROPRIATE FOR CHILDREN  (fe_03_06630-B-0026)
UM  (fe_03_06630-B-0027)
BUT THEN AGAIN YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06630-B-0028)
I MEAN AT HOME THE PARENTS CAN MONITOR THAT SOMEONE HAS TO MONITOR THAT I BELIEVE AT SCHOOL  (fe_03_06630-B-0029)
UM  (fe_03_06630-B-0030)
I I THINK THAT THEY COULD PROBABLY MONITOR UM  (fe_03_06630-B-0031)
I THINK THEY DO TO AN EXTENT GIVE THEM A A GROUP OR SECTION THAT THEY CAN CHOOSE BOOKS FROM  (fe_03_06630-B-0032)
UM  (fe_03_06630-B-0033)
AND I'M SURE THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06630-B-0035)
UM I I GUESS IN PRIVATE SCHOOLS THEY PROBABLY HAVE MORE OF A SAY  (fe_03_06630-B-0036)
AS TO WHAT BOOKS THEY CAN AND CAN'T GIVEN ANYTHING PRIVATE I THINK HAS MORE LEEWAY AS TO WHAT THEY CAN RESTRICT  (fe_03_06630-B-0037)
I DON'T KNOW WHAT DO YOU THINK  (fe_03_06630-B-0038)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06630-B-0039)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06630-B-0040)

YOU KNOW BASICALLY YOU HAVE THE FREEDOM TO READ WHATEVER YOU WANT  (fe_03_06630-B-0043)
UM BUT YOU KNOW AS FAR AS MINOR CHILDREN  (fe_03_06630-B-0044)
I I DO THINK THERE'S A SORT OF RESPONSIBILITY TO SORT OF UM  (fe_03_06630-B-0045)
MAKE SURE THAT BOOKS THAT MAYBE HAVE INAPPROPRIATE LANGUAGE OR YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06630-B-0046)
EVEN JUST ANYTHING WITH THEIR A RACY SUBJECT MATTER  (fe_03_06630-B-0047)
UM  (fe_03_06630-B-0048)
I I DON'T BELIEVE EVEN WITH THE YOU KNOW FREEDOM OF YOU KNOW THAT KIDS CAN DO THAT ON THEIR OWN [LAUGHTER] I DON'T THINK THEY NEED TO GET UM ACCESS TO THAT AT SCHOOL  (fe_03_06630-B-0049)
YEAH SO YOU KNOW I THINK THAT UM  (fe_03_06630-B-0050)
I THINK FOR BOTH PUBLIC I MEAN I KNOW PUBLIC SCHOOL YOU KNOW HAS A LOT OF RULES YOU KNOW AS FAR AS  (fe_03_06630-B-0051)

UM LIMIT THE BOOKS I I KNOW THAT THEY OBVIOUSLY CAN'T YOU KNOW PRAY OR WHATEVER BUT UM YOU KNOW MY CHILDREN GO TO PUBLIC SCHOOL  (fe_03_06630-B-0056)
AND I MEAN THEY THEY DO READ I I THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY BOOKS ABOUT  (fe_03_06630-B-0057)
RELI- I MEAN HOLIDAYS ARE ABOUT THE ONLY THING AND AND BASICALLY THEY THEY DO ALL OF THE HOLIDAYS  (fe_03_06630-B-0058)
UM  (fe_03_06630-B-0059)
AS FAR AS BOOKS AH I'VE SEEN YOU KNOW BOOKS ON HANNUKAH AND YOU KNOW CHRISTMAS AND AND SUCH BUT OTHER THAN THAT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THEIR LIBRARY PROBABLY HAS BOOKS ON  (fe_03_06630-B-0060)

YOU KNOW JESUS AND UM I'M SURE IT DOESN'T I'M SURE THEY DON'T STACK YOU KNOW RELIGIOUS STORIES UM  (fe_03_06630-B-0062)
WELL  (fe_03_06630-B-0063)
I THINK I DON'T THINK THAT THEY CAN I I THINK BECAUSE OF THE SEPARATION OF YOU KNOW CHURCH AND STATE  (fe_03_06630-B-0064)
I I THINK THAT THAT'S YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06630-B-0065)
WE HEAR ON THE NEWS THAT THEY'RE  (fe_03_06630-B-0066)
HAVING DEBATES ABOUT HAVING PLAQUES OFF WALLS THAT SHOW THE TEN COMMANDMENTS OUTSIDE OF A UM  (fe_03_06630-B-0067)
A STATE BUILDING  (fe_03_06630-B-0068)
AND YOU KNOW I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S PROBABLY SOMETHING I SHOULD PROBABLY ASK ABOUT BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THEY HAVE RELIGIOUS BOOKS AT THEIR PUBLIC SCHOOL  (fe_03_06630-B-0069)
I BELIEVE THAT THEY PROBABLY  (fe_03_06630-B-0070)
YEAH BUT I BELIEVE THEIR ACCESS TO THAT WOULD BE THROUGH UM THE C._C._D. PROGRAM  (fe_03_06630-B-0071)
AND THROUGH WHATEVER OTHER RELIGIOUS EDUCATION PROGRAM  (fe_03_06630-B-0072)
UM THEY WOULD GET  (fe_03_06630-B-0073)
YEAH SO UM  (fe_03_06630-B-0074)
NOT TO MENTION YOU KNOW I MEAN I THINK WE'RE BOTH IN AGREEMENT AS FAR AS OTHER SUBJECT MATTER  (fe_03_06630-B-0075)

UM CATHOLIC GRADE SCHOOL  (fe_03_06630-B-0079)
AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW WE HAD BOOKS ON SAINTS  (fe_03_06630-B-0080)
FOR THAT MATTER BUT I DOUBT VERY HIGHLY THAT MY KIDS HAVE BOOKS ON SAINTS IN THEIR SCHOOL LIBRARY  (fe_03_06630-B-0081)
SO I I THINK THAT'S NO I I WOULD HIGHLY DOUBT IT  (fe_03_06630-B-0082)
UM YOU KNOW OTHER SUBJECT MATTER THOUGH  (fe_03_06630-B-0083)
I THINK THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO READ ABOUT YOU KNOW UM CONTROVERSIAL SUBJECTS AND MY DAUGHTER'S BROUGHT HOME BOOKS ABOUT YOU KNOW BLACK SLAVES AND AND SUCH AND UM  (fe_03_06630-B-0084)
YOU KNOW AND I DO BELIEVE YOU KNOW THEY'RE REALISTIC AND AND THEY CAN LEARN FROM REAL LIFE STORIES I MEAN  (fe_03_06630-B-0085)

HAVE A SAY  (fe_03_06630-B-0092)
IN WHAT BOOKS [LAUGHTER] I THINK THE ORIGINAL QUE- WHAT WAS THE ORIGINAL QUESTION  (fe_03_06630-B-0093)

IN THE BOOKS  (fe_03_06630-B-0095)
AH THAT CHILDREN ARE ABLE TO READ  (fe_03_06630-B-0096)
AND SO I THINK THAT THEY SHOULD  (fe_03_06630-B-0097)
I I KNOW THAT'S PARTLY CENSORSHIP  (fe_03_06630-B-0098)
BY THEIR MONITORING THAT BUT I'M OKAY WITH THAT [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06630-B-0099)
CENSORSHIP IS UM  (fe_03_06630-B-0100)

WHAT WAS I SAYING UM  (fe_03_06630-B-0105)
CENSORSHIP IS WHERE THEY ACTUALLY ARE ABLE TO RESTRICT  (fe_03_06630-B-0106)
UH EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN THINGS WHETHER IT BE BOOKS OR MOVIES OR YOU KNOW IT'S WHERE THEY'RE CENSORING OUT YOU KNOW WHAT IS DEEMED INAPPROPRIATE  (fe_03_06630-B-0107)
AND WHAT IS DEEMED INAPPROPRIATE IN ONE CULTURE  (fe_03_06630-B-0108)
MAY NOT BE NECESSARILY DEEMED INAPPROPRIATE IN ANOTHER CULTURE  (fe_03_06630-B-0109)
I MEAN I WOULD THINK THAT YOU KNOW STRICT RELIGIOUS UM  (fe_03_06630-B-0110)
YOU KNOW PRIVATE SCHOOLS WOULD DEEM A LOT OF PROBABLY WHAT KIDS IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE ABLE TO  (fe_03_06630-B-0111)
