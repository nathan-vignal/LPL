CENSOR YEAH  (fe_03_06600-B-0003)

YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN  (fe_03_06600-B-0006)

UM  (fe_03_06600-B-0017)
PROBABLY WOULDN'T GO THE WAY THEY DO DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN  (fe_03_06600-B-0018)

UM  (fe_03_06600-B-0027)
MHM  (fe_03_06600-B-0028)
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT CENSORSHIP IN NEWSPAPERS AND ON T._V. AND THAT KIND OF THING LIKE IN MAGAZINES  (fe_03_06600-B-0029)
YEAH  (fe_03_06600-B-0031)
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT LIKE UM CUTTING THINGS OUT OF THE NEWS LIKE THE THINGS THAT WE SEE ABOUT WARS GOING ON IN OTHER COUNTRIES THAT THIS COUNTRY PAID AGAIN DO YOU THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO UM RESTRICT WHAT  (fe_03_06600-B-0032)
THE PUBLIC KNOWS ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON  (fe_03_06600-B-0033)
YEAH  (fe_03_06600-B-0034)
LIKE IN NINE ELEVEN THEY YOU KNOW THEY DIDN'T WANT THE PUBLIC TO KNOW LIKE CERTAIN THINGS THAT WERE GOING ON WHAT GROUPS WERE INVOLVED AND WHAT WAS GOING ON AND UP UNTIL THAT POINT  (fe_03_06600-B-0035)
PEOPLE WERE COMPLETELY UNAWARE OF WHAT WAS ACTUALLY GOING ON DO YOU THINK THAT  (fe_03_06600-B-0036)
IT WOULD OF HELPED IF OTHER PEOPLE HAD KNOWN WHAT WAS GOING ON  (fe_03_06600-B-0037)
LIKE THE PUBLIC REACTION  (fe_03_06600-B-0038)
YEAH  (fe_03_06600-B-0039)
DO YOU THINK THERE WAS LIKE A WORST PANIC BECAUSE PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON  (fe_03_06600-B-0040)
MHM  (fe_03_06600-B-0043)
IT DIDN'T DO ANY GOOD TO LIKE  (fe_03_06600-B-0044)
STOP EVERYBODY RANDOMLY IN AIRPORTS TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON AFTER  (fe_03_06600-B-0045)
IT HAPPENED  (fe_03_06600-B-0046)
UM  (fe_03_06600-B-0047)
I THINK THAT LIKE TO A DEGREE  (fe_03_06600-B-0048)
THINGS LIKE CERTAIN THINGS LIKE YOU SAY KIND OF MAYBE WITH HELD FROM THE PUBLIC  (fe_03_06600-B-0049)
BUT IT REALLY DEPENDS I MEAN IF IT'S LIKE A STORY OF PUBLIC INTEREST AND THAT KIND OF THING  (fe_03_06600-B-0050)
LIKE SOMEBODY IN THE COMMUNITY IS BEING HARMED OR UM  (fe_03_06600-B-0051)
THERE'S LIKE A SCAM GOING ON OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT I THINK THE PUBLIC HAS TO RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON THEY CAN'T PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM IT COMPLETELY AND THEN THEY JUST KIND OF DEFEAT THEIR OWN PURPOSE OF TELLING PEOPLE ABOUT IT  (fe_03_06600-B-0052)
SO THERE'S REALLY NO POINT IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TELL SOMEBODY THE WHOLE STORY  (fe_03_06600-B-0053)
DON'T TELL THEM PIECES OF IT BECAUSE THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING MORE WITH PIECES THAN THEY CAN WITH NOTHING  (fe_03_06600-B-0054)
ARE LIKE DURING THE WHOLE NINE ELEVEN THING OR WHATEVER UM  (fe_03_06600-B-0055)
THERE WAS THAT LIKE AFTERWARDS THERE WAS THAT WHOLE ANTHRAX SCARE EVERYBODY WAS  (fe_03_06600-B-0056)
YEAH THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY CRAZY AND I  (fe_03_06600-B-0057)
I THINK THAT IF THE PUBLIC HAD BEEN MORE AWARE OF THE DISEASE AND UM LIKE WHERE IT WAS AT AND WHAT WAS GOING ON WHAT WAS GOING HELP TREAT AND PREVENT IT THEN PEOPLE WOULDN'T OF PANICKED THE WAY THEY DID  (fe_03_06600-B-0058)
SO I MEAN I GUESS YOU'VE GOT TO DRAW A LINE SOMEWHERE  (fe_03_06600-B-0059)
WHERE UM YOU GIVE TOO MUCH INFORMATION AND PEOPLE PANIC IF YOU GET TOO LITTLE INFORMATION AND PEOPLE PANIC  (fe_03_06600-B-0060)
YEAH AND I DON'T THINK IT'S BALANCED RIGHT  (fe_03_06600-B-0061)
NOW THERE'S QUITE A FEW THINGS I DON'T THINK ARE BALANCED  (fe_03_06600-B-0062)
YEAH [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06600-B-0063)
YEAH AND LIKE  (fe_03_06600-B-0064)
UM IN THE COMMUNITY WHERE I LIVE UM A PERSON IN LIKE THE SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION ACTUALLY GOT AN ENVELOPE FULL OF WHITE POWDER  (fe_03_06600-B-0065)
AND UM EVERYBODY JUST PANICKED AND I THINK THAT IF PEOPLE HAD BEEN A BIT MORE AWARE OF LIKE  (fe_03_06600-B-0066)
ANTHRAX IN GENERAL RATHER THAN JUST YOU KNOW GETTING ENVELOPES FULL OF WHITE POWDER PEOPLE WOULDN'T OF PANICKED BECAUSE EVERYBODY WAS TERRIFIED  (fe_03_06600-B-0067)

YEAH  (fe_03_06600-B-0070)
YEAH  (fe_03_06600-B-0071)
I I THINK LIKE THAT KIND OF INFORMATION IF PEOPLE HAD  (fe_03_06600-B-0072)
AND I THINK PART OF THE PROBLEM IS PEOPLE DIDN'T THEY DIDN'T WANT TO GO FIND THE FACTS IF THEY HAD GONE AND RESEARCHED ANTHRAX THEN THEY WOULD OF KNOWN LIKE THE KIND OF THINGS THAT COULD HAPPEN AND THEN THEY WOULDN'T  (fe_03_06600-B-0073)
THE RUMORS WOULDN'T OF FLOWN THE WAY THEY DID AND PEOPLE WOULD OF GOTTEN THE TRUTH  (fe_03_06600-B-0074)
LIKE RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING INSTEAD OF THE END WHERE EVERYBODY IS ALREADY PANICKED AND  (fe_03_06600-B-0075)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06600-B-0077)
YEAH  (fe_03_06600-B-0078)
YEAH  (fe_03_06600-B-0079)
CENSORSHIP IN OTHER COUNTRIES PEOPLE ARE LIKE SO LIMITED ON THE THINGS THAT THEY HAVE AVAILABLE TO THEM EVEN LIKE RESEARCH THINGS  (fe_03_06600-B-0081)
THINGS JUST AREN'T REALLY AVAILABLE  (fe_03_06600-B-0082)
YEAH  (fe_03_06600-B-0083)
YEAH LIKE IN IRAQ AND IRAN RIGHT NOW THINK EVERYONE DECIDES WHAT THE PUBLIC GETS TO HEAR AND WHAT THEY GET TO KNOW AND  (fe_03_06600-B-0084)
AND THAT'S THE KIND OF THINGS THAT THEY THEY START UM THE ONLY THING THEY HEAR OVER THERE IS UM THE AMERICANS ARE DOING THIS AND THE AMERICANS ARE DOING THAT SO AUTOMATICALLY BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION THEY CONCLUDED  (fe_03_06600-B-0085)
THAT THE AMERICANS ARE DOING THIS AND THAT THEY WERE DOING THAT AND NOBODY REALLY KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON THEY JUST ASSUME THAT  (fe_03_06600-B-0086)
THEY'RE BEING FULL ON ATTACKED  (fe_03_06600-B-0087)
AND AND [NOISE]  (fe_03_06600-B-0088)
IT'S IT'S ALWAYS THAT WAY OVER THERE THEY ALWAYS HAVE CENSORSHIP ON  (fe_03_06600-B-0089)
LIKE WHAT THEY'RE ALLOWED TO HEAR AND WHAT THEY'RE ALLOWED TO READ AND WHAT THEY ARE ALLOWED TO KNOW  (fe_03_06600-B-0090)
AND IT'S THIS COUNTRY'S PRETTY FORTUNATE BECAUSE  (fe_03_06600-B-0091)
UM THERE'S DEFINITELY LIMITS THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO THEIR AUTHORITY  (fe_03_06600-B-0092)
