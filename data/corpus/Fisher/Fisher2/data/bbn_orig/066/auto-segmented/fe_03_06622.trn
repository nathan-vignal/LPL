I THINK THAT A PUBLIC SCHOOL SERVES A VERY WIDE SEGMENT OF SOCIETY  (fe_03_06622-B-0025)
AND  (fe_03_06622-B-0026)
THEREFORE I THINK  (fe_03_06622-B-0027)
IT'S THE PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY TO SAY  (fe_03_06622-B-0028)
TO THE CHILD YOU MAY OR MAY NOT READ THESE KINDS OF BOOKS  (fe_03_06622-B-0029)
UM  (fe_03_06622-B-0030)

AND YOU KNOW I'M  (fe_03_06622-B-0040)
OKAY SO I DON'T THINK  (fe_03_06622-B-0041)
I THINK IT'S UP TO THE PARENTS TO SCREEN WHAT THE KIDS GET FROM ANY LIBRARY  (fe_03_06622-B-0042)
I THINK PUBLIC SCHOOL LIBRARIES  (fe_03_06622-B-0043)
WELL I DON'T THINK THEY THEY SHOULD UH NOW  (fe_03_06622-B-0044)
UM  (fe_03_06622-B-0045)
THAT PUBLIC SCHOOL GETS US INTO ANOTHER THING WHICH IS THE REQUIRED BOOKS THAT THE TEACHER ASSIGNS  (fe_03_06622-B-0046)
AND I THINK THERE SHOULD BE A WAY THAT THAT PARENTS CAN OPT OUT OF THEIR CHILDREN READING THAT BOOK  (fe_03_06622-B-0047)
OKAY PRIVATE SCHOOLS  (fe_03_06622-B-0049)
OKAY PRIVATE SCHOOLS ARE DIFFERENT  (fe_03_06622-B-0050)
IF I SEND MY CHILD TO A PRIVATE SCHOOL  (fe_03_06622-B-0051)

A HEBREW SCHOOL  (fe_03_06622-B-0059)

I THINK THAT'S OKAY [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06622-B-0061)
ACTUALLY I THINK A HEBREW SCHOOL PROBABLY WOULD HAVE [LAUGHTER] COPIES OF THE NEW TESTAMENT BUT  (fe_03_06622-B-0064)
NO I I THINK I THINK EVEN PRIVATE NON RELIGIOUS  (fe_03_06622-B-0065)

WHAT THEIR PARENTS WANT AND DON'T WANT THEIR CHILDREN EXPOSED TO  (fe_03_06622-B-0067)
