BUT UM YEAH HOUSEWORK IS SUPPOSED TO BURN A TON OF CALORIES IT'S ACTUALLY SUPPOSED TO BE THE BEST WAY TO BURN BURN CALORIES  (fe_03_06667-A-0012)
AND THEN YOU KNOW THERE'S HOUSE CLEANING THEN THERE'S SEX THEN THERE'S REGULAR EXERCISE AND THERE'S YOU KNOW IT IT WENT THROUGH THIS WHOLE LIST I SAW IT AT MY DOCTOR'S OFFICE ONCE  (fe_03_06667-A-0013)

AND IT MESSES YOU ALL UP  (fe_03_06667-A-0019)
YEAH AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHAT HAPPENED TO ME BECAUSE I WAS EXERCISING FAIRLY REGULARLY I WAS GOING OUT AND RUNNING IN THE MORNINGS  (fe_03_06667-A-0020)
AND I WOULD COME HOME AFTER WORK AND JUST EXERCISE WHETHER IT WAS ONE OF THE TAPES OR YOU KNOW WHATEVER IT WAS GOING BACK OUT TO RUN WITH MY DAUGHTER  (fe_03_06667-A-0021)
BUT THEN I GOT BRONCHITIS AND COULDN'T DO ANY OF THAT AND I JUST HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET BACK INTO IT  (fe_03_06667-A-0022)
