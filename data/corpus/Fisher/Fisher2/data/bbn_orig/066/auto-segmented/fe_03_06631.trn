OKAY I'M LEIA I'M FROM NEW YORK TOO [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06631-A-0003)
YEAH COULD BE INTERESTING  (fe_03_06631-A-0004)
I THINK THAT THEY SPECIFICALLY SAID PUBLIC AH PRIVATE SCHOOLS  (fe_03_06631-A-0005)
I MAY I MAY HAVE MISHEARD I WASN'T REALLY PAYING ATTENTION  (fe_03_06631-A-0006)
BECAUSE BECAUSE I DEFINITELY DO HAVE A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION IF IT'S PRIVATE VERSUS PUBLIC  (fe_03_06631-A-0007)
WELL  (fe_03_06631-A-0008)
[SIGH] I I DO BELIEVE THAT A PRIVATE SCHOOL  (fe_03_06631-A-0009)
CANNOT LET THEIR KIDS READ CERTAIN BOOKS  (fe_03_06631-A-0010)
BECAUSE WHEN YOU SAY PRIVATE TO ME UM I'M HEARING PRIVATE PAROCHIAL  (fe_03_06631-A-0011)
AND I I THINK THAT IF YOU'RE SENDING A KID TO A PAROCHIAL OR PRIVATE SCHOOL  (fe_03_06631-A-0012)
UM  (fe_03_06631-A-0013)
YOU'RE MAKING A CERTAIN STATEMENT TO LINE UP WITH THOSE VALUES AND IF THAT'S [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW AS WRONG AS THOSE VALUES MAY BE [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06631-A-0014)
UM 'CAUSE I I PERSON- PERSONALLY AM NOT INTO CENSORSHIP OF BOOKS IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM  (fe_03_06631-A-0015)
BUT IN TERMS OF SCHOOL AND IN TERMS OF WHAT STUDENTS ARE PERMITTED TO READ I I WOULD HAVE TO MAKE A DISTINCTION  (fe_03_06631-A-0016)
YES YES AND IF THEY DON'T THEY DESERVE WHAT THEY GET  (fe_03_06631-A-0017)

WE AGONIZE I HAVE A DAUGHTER THAT'S GOING TO BE LOOKING AT HIGH SCHOOLS NEXT YEAR  (fe_03_06631-A-0028)
AND UM IT'S A VERY BIG DISCUSSION WHERE OUR VALUES LINE UP WITH THE VALUES OF THE PARTICULAR SCHOOLS  (fe_03_06631-A-0029)

BUT IT'S AGAIN YOU REALLY HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO CARE ENOUGH TO ASK  (fe_03_06631-A-0031)
UM IT'S DOABLE  (fe_03_06631-A-0032)

[SIGH]  (fe_03_06631-A-0072)
WHAT SHALL I TELL YOU  (fe_03_06631-A-0073)
I THINK A SCHOOL IS PERMITTED TO LIMIT WHAT THEIR KIDS READ  (fe_03_06631-A-0074)
NOW WAIT WAIT WAIT LET'S LET'S LET'S LOOK AT THIS IF THE SCHOOL CAME OUT AND CENSORED A BOOK AND I FELT THAT THEY WERE REALLY OUT OF LINE  (fe_03_06631-A-0075)
I DON'T THINK I'D HAVE A HESITATION ABOUT GETTING TOGETHER WITH OTHER PARENTS AND APPROACHING THE BOARD OR THE TEACHER OR THE SCHOOL GOING THROUGH THE CHANNELS OF LIFTING THAT RESTRICTION BUT AGAIN IN THEORY THE CONCEPT OF A SCHOOL PUTTING A BAN ON A CERTAIN BOOK  (fe_03_06631-A-0076)
