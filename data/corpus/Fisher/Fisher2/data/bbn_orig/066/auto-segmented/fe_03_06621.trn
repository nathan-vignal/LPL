THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  (fe_03_06621-A-0033)
AND THEIR CURRICULUMS AND THEIR STUFF THAT THEY'RE CARRYING  (fe_03_06621-A-0034)

SHOULD AH  (fe_03_06621-A-0042)
SHOULD SHOULD TEACHERS HAVE SOME KIND OF I DON'T KNOW  (fe_03_06621-A-0043)
I DON'T KNOW THEY'RE SAYING SHOULD WE HAVE SOME KIND OF A SAY OVER WHAT THE KIDS READ AND AND I THINK IT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH WHAT THE TEACHERS HAVE TO TEACH THEM  (fe_03_06621-A-0044)
AND SEE TH- 'CAUSE THE TEACHERS HAVE VERY STRICT UM  (fe_03_06621-A-0045)
GUIDELINES THAT THEY HAVE TO FOLLOW  (fe_03_06621-A-0046)
AND THEY HAVE A  (fe_03_06621-A-0047)

WHAT DO YOU CALL IT A TEACHER PLAN THING WHATEVER YOU CALL THAT THING THAT THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH  (fe_03_06621-A-0049)
'CAUSE I KNOW I HAVE A FRIEND THAT'S A TEACHER IN TEXAS AND SHE HAS MORE PROBLEMS WITH THE PRINCIPALS YOU KNOW AND AND HAVING THE PRINCIPAL DEAL WITH  (fe_03_06621-A-0050)
LOOKING OVER WHAT'S YOUR PLAN FOR THE DAY OR WHATEVER OR WHATEVER  (fe_03_06621-A-0051)
'CAUSE IF YOU HAVE A SUBSTITUTE COMING IN THEN THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE OVER RIGHT WHERE YOU LEFT OFF  (fe_03_06621-A-0052)
MHM  (fe_03_06621-A-0053)
YEAH BECAUSE THEY EVEN HAVE LIKE SEX EDUCATION AND EVERYTHING NOWADAYS AND SO  (fe_03_06621-A-0055)
I DON'T KNOW I THINK THAT THERE HAS TO BE KIND OF A CENSORSHIP GOING ON THERE HAS TO BE JUST LIKE WHOEVER MONITORS THE THE RATINGS OF THE MOVIES THERE HAS TO BE SOME KIND OF A CENSORSHIP EVEN MHM  (fe_03_06621-A-0056)

SO TEACHERS SHOULD HAVE A SAY OR OR  (fe_03_06621-A-0064)
'CAUSE A LOT OF TIMES I THINK THAT THEY HAVE TO 'CAUSE I WATCH A LOT OF THESE COURT T._V. THINGS GOING ON  (fe_03_06621-A-0065)
AND THE JUDGE A LOT OF TIMES  (fe_03_06621-A-0066)
ENDS UP YELLING AT THE PARENTS IF THERE'S A KID INVOLVED FOR WHATEVER REASON  (fe_03_06621-A-0067)
AND YOU KNOW LIKE THERE'S ONE ONE TIME WHERE THE KID HAD A FOUL MOUTH OR SOMETHING AND THEY JUST STARTED JUST YELLING AT THE PARENTS WELL THEY KNOW FOR A FACT THAT THE PARENT PUT THE THEY MUST ALLOW IT OR THAT HE LEARNED THAT FROM THE PARENTS AND ON AND ON AND ON AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS A LOT OF TIMES  (fe_03_06621-A-0068)
YEAH OR THE PARENTS BOUGHT THEM THE STUPID BOOK OR WHATEVER IT IS THAT THE KID IS READING  (fe_03_06621-A-0069)
OR MAYBE IT WAS THE PARENTS' BOOK AND THE KID BORROWED IT AND BROUGHT IT TO SCHOOL AND THE TEACHER SAW IT  (fe_03_06621-A-0070)
YEAH  (fe_03_06621-A-0071)

HELLO  (fe_03_06621-B-0001)
HI MY NAME'S TINA I'M FROM FORT LAUDERDALE FLORIDA  (fe_03_06621-B-0002)
YES  (fe_03_06621-B-0003)
HI KAREN HOW ARE YOU  (fe_03_06621-B-0004)
YEAH AND THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT PRIVATE SCHOOLS IF UM THEY SHOULD BE READING UM SPECIFIC BOOKS AND STUFF  (fe_03_06621-B-0005)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06621-B-0006)
I I THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT EVERYDAY CENSORSHIP [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06621-B-0007)
YEAH  (fe_03_06621-B-0008)
UM  (fe_03_06621-B-0009)
WELL IT'S  (fe_03_06621-B-0010)
I THINK PRIVATE SCHOOLS ARE A GOOD IDEA  (fe_03_06621-B-0011)
UM AS FOR THEM  (fe_03_06621-B-0012)
MAKING THE RULES OF THEM HAVING TO DO SPECIFIC THINGS AND SPECIFIC BOOKS I KIND OF AGREE WITH THAT THAT'S WHY WE'RE TAKING YOU KNOW OUR KIDS OUT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND PUTTING THEM INTO THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS  (fe_03_06621-B-0013)
UM  (fe_03_06621-B-0014)
UM  (fe_03_06621-B-0015)
I THINK THAT THEY SH- I OH SEE I CAN GO BOTH WAYS ON THIS [LAUGHTER] UM  (fe_03_06621-B-0016)
I THINK THE FACT THAT THEY MAKE THE RULES ON WHAT THE KIDS CAN READ AND WHAT THE KIDS CAN LEARN ABOUT IS POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE  (fe_03_06621-B-0017)
IT'S POSITIVE IN THEY CAN CENSOR OUT ALL OF THE BAD THINGS  (fe_03_06621-B-0018)
YOU KNOW LIKE BASICALLY WHAT GOES ON IN SOCIETY THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO CENSOR THAT BUT THE BAD THING ABOUT THAT IS ONCE THE CHILD GETS OUT OF PRIVATE SCHOOL I FEEL THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE BLIND TO THE WORLD  (fe_03_06621-B-0019)
YOU KNOW JUST LIKE IF YOU SEND YOUR CHILD TO BOARDING SCHOOL AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE WAR OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT THEN WHEN YOUR CHILD EVENTUALLY GROWS UP THEY'RE GOING TO BE LIKE WOW YOU KNOW WHERE WAS I WHAT HAPPENED OR  (fe_03_06621-B-0020)
I DON'T KNOW I FEEL STRANGELY ABOUT THAT  (fe_03_06621-B-0021)
YEAH WELL THAT DEFINITELY NEEDS CENSORSHIP  (fe_03_06621-B-0022)
MHM  (fe_03_06621-B-0023)
[LAUGHTER] PRETTY MUCH  (fe_03_06621-B-0024)
I DON'T THINK KIDS NOWADAYS KNOW WHETHER THEY'RE COMING OR THEY'RE GOING  (fe_03_06621-B-0025)
'CAUSE THEY'RE EITHER PUSHED INTO THE PEER PRESSURE AND HAVING YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT WE DO HAVE MATERIALS LIKE LET'S SAY ON THE INTERNET THAT MAKES IT CAPABLE FOR KIDS TO BUILD BOMBS AND AND YOU KNOW MAP OUT THEIR EXACT PLANS ON HOW TO WIPE SOMEONE OUT  (fe_03_06621-B-0026)
I THINK THAT'S A REALLY HORRIBLE THING YOU KNOW SO WE SHOULD HAVE CENSORSHIP IN THAT POINT BUT WHEN IT COMES TO BOOKS AND STUFF I THINK THERE SHOULD BE CENSORSHIP TO A CERTAIN DEGREE BUT I THINK THE CHILDREN SHOULD ALSO BE ABLE TO VOICE THEIR OPINION  (fe_03_06621-B-0027)
AND YOU KNOW INSTEAD OF THEM BEING ABLE TO DO WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WHY NOT BRING IT UP YOU KNOW TO WHOEVER'S IN CHARGE AND SAY YOU KNOW THIS IS WHAT WE WANT AND THEN THAT PERSON HAS THE RIGHT TO LOOK OVER WITH THEIR COLLEAGUES AND DETERMINE WHETHER IT'S A GOOD CHOICE OR A BAD CHOICE  (fe_03_06621-B-0028)
I PERSONALLY [COUGH] EXCUSE ME I DON'T REALLY CARE FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS  (fe_03_06621-B-0029)
IF I HAD THE MONEY MY CHILDREN WOULD BOTH GO TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS BECAUSE THE PUBLIC SCHOOL NOWADAYS  (fe_03_06621-B-0030)
DOESN'T SEEM TO CARE AS MUCH AS THEY DID WHEN I WAS A KID  (fe_03_06621-B-0031)
UM IT SEEMS NOWADAYS THAT THE TEACHERS ARE JUST THERE MORE FOR A PAY CHECK RATHER THAN BEING THERE TO TEACH THE CHILDREN AND STUFF  (fe_03_06621-B-0032)
YOU KNOW I KNOW BY THE TIME I HIT HIGH SCHOOL THAT I WAS NOTICING TEACHERS BEING LIKE THAT TOO  (fe_03_06621-B-0033)
UM  (fe_03_06621-B-0034)
YOU KNOW THEY DON'T A LOT OF TEACHERS DON'T CARE ABOUT WHAT [MN] THE KIDS ARE READING OR WHAT THEY'RE DOING OR IF THEY GO OUT FOR THE YOU KNOW THE BATHROOM PASS SAY OKAY YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES WELL THEY COME BACK HALF AN HOUR LATER THE TEACHERS DON'T ASK WHERE WERE YOU ANYMORE  (fe_03_06621-B-0035)
AT LEAST IN A PRIVATE SCHOOL  (fe_03_06621-B-0036)
THEY IT'S THEIR BUSINESS TO KNOW EVERYTHING THAT'S WHY WE PAY THEM  (fe_03_06621-B-0037)
BECAUSE WE WANT THEM TO BE IN OUR CHILD'S BUSINESS WE WANT OUR CHILD TO GET THE BEST OF EDUCATIONS YOU KNOW TO KNOW ALL THAT THEY SHOULD KNOW GET INTO THE BEST COLLEGES AND THINGS LIKE THAT  (fe_03_06621-B-0038)
MHM  (fe_03_06621-B-0039)
YEAH  (fe_03_06621-B-0040)
MHM  (fe_03_06621-B-0041)
MY MOTHER HAS WORKED ACTUALLY FOR THE SCHOOL BOARD AND MY FATHER FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS NOW  (fe_03_06621-B-0043)
UM YOU KNOW AND SHE'S NOTICED THAT IN SCHOOLS THAT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE YOUR CURRICULUM AND A LOT OF TEACHERS ABIDE BY THEM AND YOU KNOW THEY GO BY THE BOOKS THAT'S OKAY AND IT GETS OKAY WITH THE PRINCIPAL AND SHE SAID THAT THERE'S STILL TEACHERS OUT THERE THAT ARE FIGHTING FOR  (fe_03_06621-B-0044)
BOOKS THAT ARE A LITTLE MORE EXPLICIT  (fe_03_06621-B-0045)
SO WE CAN KIND OF GIVE THE KIDS ON THIS IS YOU KNOW THIS IS EVERYDAY LIFE I DON'T  (fe_03_06621-B-0046)
I SO I DON'T KN- I  (fe_03_06621-B-0047)
MHM  (fe_03_06621-B-0048)
OH I AGREE I AGREE FULLY YOU KNOW BUT YOU KNOW THINK ABOUT WHEN WE WERE IN SCHOOL WHAT SEX EDUCATION WAS TO US  (fe_03_06621-B-0049)
IT WAS THIS YOU KNOW VERY ODD MOVIE [LAUGHTER] FROM WHAT I REMEMBER AND SOMEONE STANDING UP WHEN THE MOVIE WAS DONE DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS  (fe_03_06621-B-0050)
NOWADAYS THINGS ARE DIFFERENT I MEAN WHEN I WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD I PLAYED WITH BARBIES  (fe_03_06621-B-0051)
NOW WE HAVE TWELVE YEAR OLDS THAT ARE GETTING COMPLETELY THEY'RE PREGNANT [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06621-B-0052)
READY TO HAVE A BABY AND EVERYTHING AND I THAT AMAZES ME THAT AMAZES ME  (fe_03_06621-B-0053)
YOU KNOW MAYBE IN SCHOOLS IF THEY WERE A LITTLE MORE OPEN TO EXPLAINING [MN] IF YOU HAVE SEX THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND AND  (fe_03_06621-B-0054)
YOU KNOW BRING REAL PEOPLE INTO THE PICTURE BRING THE UM TEENAGE PREGNANT MOTHERS IN YOU KNOW WHERE ARE THEY NOW TEN YEARS LATER THINGS LIKE THAT  (fe_03_06621-B-0055)
SO I MEAN CENSORSHIP SHOULD PLAY A PART BUT I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT TODAY'S SOCIETY AND OPEN UP THE CENSORSHIP JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE  (fe_03_06621-B-0056)
I MEAN I THINK THAT WAY THEY CAN TEACH A FEW MORE THINGS  (fe_03_06621-B-0057)
I THINK I THINK THA- YOU KNOW [MN] I THINK THEY SHOULD  (fe_03_06621-B-0058)
MHM  (fe_03_06621-B-0059)
YEAH  (fe_03_06621-B-0060)
YEAH THE PARENTS GET THE BLAME FOR THE CHILD BEING SO HORRIBLE MHM  (fe_03_06621-B-0061)
BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF PARENTS UH NOWADAYS THEY'RE THEY'RE OPEN WITH THEIR KIDS THEY CAN DISCUSS EVERYTHING WITH THEIR PARENTS AND YOU KNOW GET THE STRAIGHTS YOU KNOW GET AT FACTS  (fe_03_06621-B-0062)
INSTEAD OF YOU KNOW OH WELL I'VE HEARD THIS AND I'VE HEARD THAT YOU KNOW I'M  (fe_03_06621-B-0063)
I THINK I WOULD TEND TO BE MORE OF AN OPEN PARENT MY STILL MY KIDS ARE STILL YOUNG  (fe_03_06621-B-0064)
SO IT'S NOT LIKE I REALLY HAD TO GO YOU KNOW THE WORST QUESTION I WAS EVER ASKED WAS UM HOW DID YOU MAKE US  (fe_03_06621-B-0065)

WHAT KIND OF DRUGS ARE THERE WHY DO PEOPLE TAKE THEM YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE THAT THAT'S SOMETHING I'M PREPARING FOR  (fe_03_06621-B-0068)
YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THEY SHOULD WHILE IN SCHOOL THEY YOU KNOW THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO READ UP ON THESE YOU KNOW THESE ARE DRUGS THESE ARE THE EFFECTS OF DRUGS YOU KNOW THIS CAN BE THE EFFECT OF SOMETHING THAT YOU DID TEN YEARS AGO  (fe_03_06621-B-0069)
I THINK IT'S THE SAME WAY WITH SEX I THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE MORE SEX EDUCATION BOOKS AND I MEAN I GUESS WE REALLY CAN'T PUT OUT THERE ANY MORE THAN WE HAVE  (fe_03_06621-B-0070)
ON THAT ISSUE  (fe_03_06621-B-0071)
YOU KNOW BOOKS COMMERCIALS WHATEVER IT'S ALL OUT THERE NOWADAYS IT'S JUST WHAT THE CHILD WANTS  (fe_03_06621-B-0072)
