THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT THEY PROBABLY CAN'T SAY AND THAT'S WHERE CENSORSHIP IS PLAYING A BIG PART IN IT BECAUSE THEY CAN'T EVEN TELL HIS FAMILY YOU KNOW [MN] THEY DON'T THEY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING THEIRSELVES BUT THEY HAVE TO FOLLOW BY THEIR CODE THEY HAVE TO  (fe_03_06627-B-0027)

YOU KNOW THEY JUST HAVE TO FIND A CHURCH THAT THEY FIT IN BUT EVERYBODY DOESN'T FIT AT THE SAME CHURCH  (fe_03_06627-B-0038)

THEY HAD TO CHANGE THE BECAUSE OF CENSORSHIP THEY HAD TO CHANGE THE DEFINITION BUT THE DEFINITION THAT I ALWAYS SAW WHEN I WAS GROWING UP WAS A PERSON WHO DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO ACT IN PUBLIC  (fe_03_06627-B-0072)
SO THAT COULD BE AND BASICALLY THAT COULD BE ANYBODY AT ANY TIME  (fe_03_06627-B-0073)
