MY MY NAME'S MARY JANE [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06636-B-0003)
HI CARMEN  (fe_03_06636-B-0004)
YES  (fe_03_06636-B-0005)
UM WELL I GUESS IT'S ONLY FAIR TO TELL YOU I TEACH SECOND GRADE [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06636-B-0006)
I  (fe_03_06636-B-0008)
[SIGH] I IT'S A IT'S A TOUGH SUBJECT UM  (fe_03_06636-B-0009)
BECAUSE I MEAN THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT I WOULDN'T WANT MY KIDS TO GET A HOLD OF  (fe_03_06636-B-0010)
WELL LIKE AT OUR FIFTH GRADERS WE CAUGHT SOME OF THEM WITH PLAYBOYS IN THEIR BACKPACKS  (fe_03_06636-B-0011)
HERE A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO  (fe_03_06636-B-0012)
I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THAT'S NOT SCHOOL MATERIAL BUT YOU KNOW IT'S STILL CENSORSHIP INSIDE THE SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY BROUGHT SOMETHING THAT WAS INAPPROPRIATE IN  (fe_03_06636-B-0013)
TO SCHOOL  (fe_03_06636-B-0014)
UM AS FAR AS LIKE CLASSIC WORKS OF LITERATURE  (fe_03_06636-B-0015)
UM  (fe_03_06636-B-0016)
I GUESS HARRY POTTER WOULD PROBABLY BE A GOOD ONE SINCE A LOT OF UM PEOPLE WERE KIND OF UP IN ARMS A LOT OF THE RELIGIOUS GROUPS AND SUCH WHEN HIS FIRST WHEN HER FIRST BOOK CAME OUT  (fe_03_06636-B-0017)
BECAUSE IT DEALT WITH WITCHCRAFT AND SORCERY AND STUFF AND SEVERAL OF THE RELIGIOUS GROUPS WERE AGAINST IT UM  (fe_03_06636-B-0018)
I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT YOU KNOW WOULD I HAVE READ IT OUT LOUD TO ANY OF MY CLASSES NO BECAUSE AT THE TIME I WAS TEACHING THIRD GRADE AND NOW I'M TEACHING SECOND AND I JUST DON'T THINK THAT IT'S  (fe_03_06636-B-0019)
APPROPRIATE UM  (fe_03_06636-B-0020)
MATERIAL FOR THAT AGE LEVEL  (fe_03_06636-B-0021)
BUT DO I THINK THAT THAT THE LIBRARY AT SCHOOL SHOULD HAVE IT AVAILABLE FOR THEM TO CHECK OUT AT THEIR OWN CHOICE ABSOLUTELY  (fe_03_06636-B-0022)
I MEAN I THINK IT'S A CLASSIC PIECE OF WORK I THINK IT'S IN THE FICTION SECTION FOR A REASON BECAUSE I PERSONALLY DON'T BELIEVE IN WITCHCRAFT  (fe_03_06636-B-0023)
UM  (fe_03_06636-B-0024)
I IMAGINE IF YOU DID BELIEVE IN IT IT PROBABLY WOULD BE SCARY  (fe_03_06636-B-0025)
GO AHEAD  (fe_03_06636-B-0027)
NO NO I'M MONOPOLIZING SO GO RIGHT AHEAD  (fe_03_06636-B-0028)
[MN] LIKE WHAT I MEAN I CAN'T THINK OF  (fe_03_06636-B-0029)
YEAH  (fe_03_06636-B-0030)
YEAH BUT I MEAN THE WHOLE THING WITH WITH UM TOM SAWYER IS I MEAN IT'S IT'S A MASTERPIECE THE WAY HE WENT BETWEEN SO MANY DIFFERENT DIALECTS AND DIFFERENT TONES  (fe_03_06636-B-0031)
THAT YOU CAN HEAR THOSE TONES COME OUT YOU KNOW IN IN THE WRITING WHICH IS WHAT I WISH MY  (fe_03_06636-B-0032)
M- THE WRITERS IN MY CLASSROOM WOULD DO  (fe_03_06636-B-0033)
IS IS TO DO THAT BUT NOW WHAT I WHAT I HAVE A STRUGGLE WITH IS OKAY I WAS READING UM A BOOK OUT LOUD TO THE CLASS AND IT'S CALLED BECAUSE OF WIN DIXIE AND THIS IS A BOOK THAT IS  (fe_03_06636-B-0034)
VERY MUCH ACCLAIMED IT WAS ON THE YOU KNOW LIKE ALL OF THE NEW YOUNG READERS' AH  (fe_03_06636-B-0035)
YOU KNOW LIKE IT WAS PICKED BY  (fe_03_06636-B-0036)
I THINK IT IT WAS EITHER A CALDECOTT OR A NEWBURY IT WAS YOU KNOW ONE OF THE AWARD WINNING BOOKS HERE A FEW YEARS BACK IT'S A WONDERFUL BOOK BUT THERE IS  (fe_03_06636-B-0037)
YOU KNOW A POI- A POINT IN IT WHERE  (fe_03_06636-B-0038)
THERE ARE A FEW SWEAR WORDS  (fe_03_06636-B-0039)
AND I'M READING THIS OUT LOUD TO THE CLASS AND I'M LIKE  (fe_03_06636-B-0040)
THINKING TO MYSELF NOW IF I DON'T SAY THE WORD HELL  (fe_03_06636-B-0041)
TECHNICALLY I'M CENSORING THE BOOK  (fe_03_06636-B-0042)
BECAUSE I AM NOT PRESENTING THE BOOK THE WAY THE AUTHOR INTENDED IT BECAUSE THE THE LINE WAS WAR IS HELL T- PURE HELL AND IT WAS THIS WOMAN THAT HAD A VERY SOUTHERN THICK ACCENT  (fe_03_06636-B-0043)
AND THEN THE KIDS GO [SIGH] THAT'S A SWEAR WORD IN THE BOOK AND SHE GOES WELL WAR OUGHT TO BE A SWEAR WORD YOU KNOW AND SO THEN I YOU KNOW HERE I AM I'M R- READING IT OUT LOUD AND I'M LIKE FORGETTING  (fe_03_06636-B-0044)
THAT THIS WAS IN THE BOOK BECAUSE I HAVEN'T READ IT IN A WHILE AND I'M THINKING NOW DO I  (fe_03_06636-B-0045)
DO I READ THIS OUT LOUD BECAUSE IF I DON'T THEN I AM DOING JUST WHAT THE TOPIC ASKS CENSORING THINGS IN THE IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM  (fe_03_06636-B-0046)
BUT AT THAT POINT YOU KNOW I HAD TO MAKE A DECISION AND  (fe_03_06636-B-0047)
I WENT AHEAD AND DID NOT READ THE WORD BECAUSE I JUST  (fe_03_06636-B-0048)
I FELT THAT  (fe_03_06636-B-0049)
SECOND GRADERS AREN'T MATURE ENOUGH  (fe_03_06636-B-0050)
TO HEAR THAT WORD AND KNOW THAT  (fe_03_06636-B-0051)
THAT WAS THE WAY THE AUTHOR INTENDED IT  (fe_03_06636-B-0052)
BUT YET IT WOULD HAVE GOTTEN ALL THEIR ATTENTION AND THEY WOULD HAVE FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE STORY  (fe_03_06636-B-0053)
AND THE ONLY THING THEY WOULD HAVE REMEMBERED WAS THAT MRS SLAUGHTER SAID A BAD WORD IN CLASS  (fe_03_06636-B-0054)
SO I CHOSE TO  (fe_03_06636-B-0055)
CENSOR THAT BECAUSE  (fe_03_06636-B-0056)
I FELT THAT I WOULD HAVE BEEN DOING MORE HARM TO THE AUTHOR  (fe_03_06636-B-0057)
BY SAYING THE WORD THAN BY NOT NOW BY COINCIDENCE LIKE THE WEEK AFTER I FINISHED THAT BOOK WITH MY READING IT OUT LOUD TO MY SECOND GRADERS MY THIRD GRADER CAME HOME FROM SCHOOL  (fe_03_06636-B-0058)
AND HE HAD THAT FOR LITERATURE CIRCLES WHERE  (fe_03_06636-B-0059)
LIKE FIVE OR SIX KIDS ALL HAVE THE SAME BOOK AND THEY'RE ALL ASSIGNED LIKE TWO CHAPTERS EACH NIGHT TO READ AND THEN THE NEXT DAY THEY ALL HAVE A JOB THAT THEY HAVE TO DO WHETHER IT'S TO PICK OUT YOU KNOW LIKE IMPORTANT PASSAGES  (fe_03_06636-B-0060)
OR  (fe_03_06636-B-0061)
TO FIND A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE BOOK AND REAL LIFE AND HE GOT TO THAT PART AND HE'S LIKE LOOK MOMMY THERE'S A SWEAR WORD IN THERE AND I SAID WELL WHAT HAPPENED WH- HOW DID YOUR TEACHER YOU KNOW ADDRESS THAT  (fe_03_06636-B-0062)
AND HE JUST SAID WELL SHE JUST SAID THAT IT WASN'T A SWEAR WORD BECAUSE IT WAS IN THE BOOK  (fe_03_06636-B-0063)
THAT IT'S A SWEAR WORD IF YOU CHOOSE TO USE THE WORD BUT IF IT'S IN THE BOOK  (fe_03_06636-B-0064)
THEN IT'S YOU KNOW PART OF THE BOOK  (fe_03_06636-B-0065)
OKAY  (fe_03_06636-B-0067)
SO SHE DIDN'T ACTUALLY HAVE THEM LIKE READING OUT LOUD SO IT'S NOT LIKE THEY READ IT OUT LOUD IN FRONT OF PEOPLE  (fe_03_06636-B-0068)
BUT THE THING ABOUT THE CENSORSHIP ISSUE THAT KIND OF GETS ME MORE IS THE INTERNET SCARES ME TO DEATH  (fe_03_06636-B-0069)
AND I HAD ASKED UM  (fe_03_06636-B-0071)
MY FIRST YEAR IN THE CLASSROOM YOU KNOW I SAID  (fe_03_06636-B-0072)
IS IS THERE SOME SORT OF YOU KNOW PROTECTION  (fe_03_06636-B-0073)
THAT YOU CAN INSTALL IN THE COMPUTERS TO MAKE SURE THAT BECAUSE WHITEHOUSE DOT COM IS NOT WHITEHOUSE DOT ORG  (fe_03_06636-B-0074)
AND APPARENTLY  (fe_03_06636-B-0075)
THEY'RE SUPPOSEDLY VERY DIFFERENT [LAUGHTER] UM  (fe_03_06636-B-0076)
AND AS LONG AS THE KIDS KNOW YOU KNOW LIKE A COUPLE OF CATCH WORDS THEY CAN GET JUST ABOUT ANYWHERE UM IN FACT ONE OF THE OTHER SCHOOLS THAT I WAS AT  (fe_03_06636-B-0077)
UM  (fe_03_06636-B-0078)
THEY DIDN'T HAVE A GOOD ENOUGH SYSTEM IN AND WHAT THEY HAD DONE WAS THEY HAD UM  (fe_03_06636-B-0079)
PROGRAMMED  (fe_03_06636-B-0080)
OR SET ALL THE COMPUTERS' HOME PAGES  (fe_03_06636-B-0081)
TO GO TO  (fe_03_06636-B-0082)
AN LIKE A ONLINE CASINO OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT LIKE ONE OF THE LAS VEGAS CASINOS THAT HAD YOU KNOW LIKE SHOWGIRLS DANCING ACROSS THE SCREEN  (fe_03_06636-B-0083)
AND THEY COMPLETELY SHUT OUR COMPUTER SYSTEM DOWN AT SCHOOL FOR LIKE AN HOUR OR SO UNTIL THEY COULD FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW WHERE IT ORIGINATED FROM AND AND GET IT RESET AND STUFF  (fe_03_06636-B-0084)
BUT I MEAN I THINK THERE  (fe_03_06636-B-0085)
I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE  (fe_03_06636-B-0086)
COMMONSENSE I THINK THAT  (fe_03_06636-B-0087)
UM  (fe_03_06636-B-0088)
I THINK CLASSES CLASSIC PIECES OF LITERATURE WERE  (fe_03_06636-B-0089)
WRITTEN AT THE TIME THAT THEY WERE TO REFLECT  (fe_03_06636-B-0090)
THE THOUGHTS OF THE ERA  (fe_03_06636-B-0091)
UM  (fe_03_06636-B-0092)
I DON'T THINK THAT BY DANCING AROUND HISTORY  (fe_03_06636-B-0093)
YOU DO ANY FAVORS I I MEAN I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT I EXPLAIN TO  (fe_03_06636-B-0094)
SECOND GRADERS THAT THERE WAS A TIME IN AMERICA WHEN WE WERE SO SILLY THAT WE THOUGHT THAT YOU COULD BUY AND SELL OTHER PEOPLE  (fe_03_06636-B-0095)
I MEAN  (fe_03_06636-B-0096)
I TELL THEM THAT THAT WAS WRONG THAT WAS VERY WRONG BUT IF WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE MISTAKES THAT WE MADE IN THE PAST  (fe_03_06636-B-0097)
WE COULD MAKE HAD SAME KIND OF MISTAKE IN THE FUTURE  (fe_03_06636-B-0098)
SO  (fe_03_06636-B-0099)
JUST PRETENDING THAT A MISTAKE DIDN'T HAPPEN  (fe_03_06636-B-0100)
DOESN'T MAKE IT GO AWAY  (fe_03_06636-B-0101)
IT JUST MEANS THAT  (fe_03_06636-B-0102)
YOU'RE NOT ACKNOWLEDGING IT AND THEREFORE POSSIBLY DIDN'T LEARN FROM IT I MEAN IT'S OKAY TO MAKE A MISTAKE  (fe_03_06636-B-0103)
IN LIFE IN GENERAL  (fe_03_06636-B-0104)
BUT IF YOU LEARN FROM THE MISTAKE THEN IT'S NOT A MISTAKE  (fe_03_06636-B-0105)
THEN YOU'VE LEARNED LEARNED AN IMPORTANT LESSON  (fe_03_06636-B-0106)
I MEAN IT'S LIKE I TELL MY KIDS YOU LEARN MORE FROM THE THINGS THAT YOU GET WRONG ON YOUR PAPER THAN THE THINGS THAT YOU GET RIGHT  (fe_03_06636-B-0107)
YOU HAVE TO GET IT WRONG THEN YOU LOOK AT IT AND GO WHY DID I GET THAT WRONG  (fe_03_06636-B-0108)
WHERE YOU COULD HAVE JUST GUESSED AT SOMETHING AND GOTTEN IT RIGHT  (fe_03_06636-B-0109)
AND IT'S NOT GOING TO STICK BUT IF YOU GET IT WRONG YOU'RE GOING TO REMEMBER IT AND SAY WHY DID I GET THAT WRONG AND FIGURE IT OUT  (fe_03_06636-B-0110)
SO  (fe_03_06636-B-0111)
I MEAN I I AGREE THAT YOU KNOW TOM SAWYER IS  (fe_03_06636-B-0112)
