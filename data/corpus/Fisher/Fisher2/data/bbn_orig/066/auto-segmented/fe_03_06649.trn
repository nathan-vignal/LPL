I GUESS AS FAR AS THAT'S CONCERNED AH  (fe_03_06649-B-0007)
IF PARENTS DECIDE INDIVIDUALLY THAT THEY DON'T WANT THEIR CHILDREN TO READ CERTAIN BOOKS I GUESS THAT'S UP TO THEM BUT FOR THE THE THE GREATER OPINION OF THE SCHOOL I THINK IT OUGHT TO BE BE OPEN TO TO THEM TO DECIDE WHAT THEY WANT THE KIDS TO DO  (fe_03_06649-B-0008)
I MEAN WHAT IS THE WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ON THAT  (fe_03_06649-B-0009)
WE- WELL I THINK THAT THE PARENTS SHOULD DECIDE INDIVIDUALLY WHAT THEY WANT THEIR THEIR KIDS TO DO  (fe_03_06649-B-0010)
YEAH I DON'T THINK THAT THE THE SCHOOL SHOULD LEGISLATE WHAT THE INDIVIDUAL PARENTS WANT TO DO  (fe_03_06649-B-0011)
I I MEAN BECAUSE  (fe_03_06649-B-0012)
OH NO NO AS FAR AS THE SCHOOLS HAVING THE SAY  (fe_03_06649-B-0013)
OH YEAH YES WHA- YOU KNOW WHAT IS YOUR FEELING ON THAT  (fe_03_06649-B-0014)
YEAH I THINK AS FAR AS THE THE PARENTS UH SO MUCH IS TAKEN OUT OF THE PARENTS' HANDS SOMETIMES AS FAR AS AS THAT GOES THAT'S PROBABLY A LARGE PART OF WHY I'M NOT TEACHING ANY MORE  (fe_03_06649-B-0015)
AH YEAH BECAUSE THE I DON'T KNOW THE THE SCHOOL IS IT'S KIND OF HAVING TO TO BE THE THE THE PERSON THAT SETS THE TONE FOR EVERYTHING NOW AND I THINK THEY OUGHT TO BE LEFT IN THE HANDS OF THE PARENTS INDIVIDUALLY  (fe_03_06649-B-0016)
I MEAN DO DO YOU HAVE KIDS IN SCHOOL [LAUGHTER] DO YOU HAVE KIDS IN SCHOOL  (fe_03_06649-B-0017)

MHM  (fe_03_06649-B-0022)
MHM  (fe_03_06649-B-0023)
MHM  (fe_03_06649-B-0024)
I DON'T KNOW AS AS FAR AS IT GOES I LIKE I SAID THERE MAY BE SOME PARENTS THAT DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THEIR CHILDREN READING PARTICULAR BOOKS SO IT'S NOT A PROBLEM FOR THEM AND IN OTHER HOMES  (fe_03_06649-B-0025)
UH THEIR PARENTS REALLY DO HAVE A UH A PROBLEM WITH IT FOR INSTANCE I'VE KNOWN SOME PARENTS THAT HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH UH THE HARRY POTTER BOOKS  (fe_03_06649-B-0026)
ON THE OTHER HAND I'VE KNOWN SOME PARENTS THAT HAVE UH UH YOU KNOW UH BECAUSE OF RELIGIOUS REASONS THEY HAVE THEIR OWN OPINION ABOUT THAT THEY DON'T WANT THEIR CHILD READING THE BOOKS AND YOU KNOW EXPOSED TO THE BOOKS SO  (fe_03_06649-B-0027)
IT SOMETIMES IT'S KINDA IT'S BASICALLY AN INDIVIDUAL THING SOMETIMES  (fe_03_06649-B-0028)
MHM  (fe_03_06649-B-0029)
YEAH I AND PROBABLY THAT'S THAT'S MORE OF A PROBLEM WITH A PUBLIC SCHOOL THAN A PRIVATE SCHOOL PRIVATE SCHOOLS I THINK WORK A LITTLE BIT MORE ALONG WITH WHAT THE PARENTS WANT I MEAN NUMBER ONE BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE PAYING TO PUT THEIR CHILD THERE IN THE SCHOOL  (fe_03_06649-B-0030)
SO THEY'RE THEY'RE THE THEY'RE MORE PRONE TO WORK ALONG WITH THE PARENTS PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE ARE A WHOLE DIFFERENT DEAL  (fe_03_06649-B-0031)
I KNOW YOU KNOW YOU LIKE I SAID HAVING WORKED IN ONE FOR FOURTEEN YEARS UH THAT'S KIND OF HOW THEY ARE  (fe_03_06649-B-0032)
I THINK IT WAS AS FAR AS UH [MN] PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SCHOOLS DO YOU THINK THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO TO UM BAN CERTAIN BOOKS OR TELL  (fe_03_06649-B-0033)
IN OTHER WORDS I GUESS SAY STUDENTS UH HAVE TO READ A PARTICULAR BOOK DO THEY DO THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO TO SAY THAT  (fe_03_06649-B-0034)
MHM  (fe_03_06649-B-0035)

SO THEY ALL WANTED IT TAKEN OUT OF THE SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY SAID IT WAS  (fe_03_06649-B-0038)
IT HAD UH RACIAL OVERTONES AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT BUT THEY HAD TO UNDERSTAND  (fe_03_06649-B-0039)
THE TIME OR THE PERIOD OF TIME THAT MARK TRA- TWAIN WROTE THE BOOK AND THE PERIOD OF TIME THAT HE WROTE THE BOOK IT WAS REALLY KIND OF LIBERAL IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW WHAT THE THINKING WAS AT THAT TIME BUT INSTEAD OF READING THE ENTIRE BOOK  (fe_03_06649-B-0040)
AND YOU KNOW LOOKING AT THE FACT THAT IT WAS WRITTEN DURING THAT PARTICULAR UH PERIOD OF TIME THEY JUST WANTED TO TO BAN THE BOOK WITHOUT YOU KNOW CONSIDERING THAT  (fe_03_06649-B-0041)
UH VERY VERY RADICALLY I MEAN WE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE TO WORRY THAT MUCH ABOUT WHAT WE READ IN  (fe_03_06649-B-0042)
UH HIGH SCHOOL THAT THERE WAS LIKE A BOOK LIST THAT THEY GIVE YOU IN HIGH SCHOOL YOU HAD SO MANY BOOKS YOU CAN READ UH THAT YOU HAD TO CHOOSE FROM AND THAT WAS IT BUT I MEAN THERE WAS  (fe_03_06649-B-0043)
AT LEAST WHERE I GREW UP THERE WAS NOTHING CONTROVERSIAL ABOUT IT  (fe_03_06649-B-0044)
AND THERE'S JUST THIS RISK TO BE POLITICALLY CORRECT ALL THE TIME ABOUT THINGS I FIND  (fe_03_06649-B-0046)
BUT I MEAN IF THERE FOR INSTANCE  (fe_03_06649-B-0047)
WELL MY MY STEP KIDS ARE ALL GROWN NOW BUT YOU KNOW IF THERE WAS AN INSTANCE WHEN THEY WERE YOUNGER AND THERE WAS UH A BOOK THAT SAY MY HUSBAND AND I DISAGREED WITH THEM READING  (fe_03_06649-B-0048)
I I WOULD SIT DOWN WITH THEM EXPLAIN YOU KNOW WHY WE HAD THOSE FEELINGS  (fe_03_06649-B-0049)
GO OVER IT UH YOU KNOW AND DISCUSS IT WITH THE CHILD SO THAT THEY KNEW  (fe_03_06649-B-0050)
IT'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE THE NATURE OF KIDS THAT WHEN YOU BAN SOMETHING IT MAKES THEM WANT TO READ IT THAT MUCH MORE  (fe_03_06649-B-0051)
MHM  (fe_03_06649-B-0052)
IT'S JUST LIKE I SAID WHERE SCHOOL SYSTEMS AS FAR AS BOOKS ARE CONCERNED AND THINGS LIKE THAT THAT THE THE INDIVIDUAL PARENT HAS THE RIGHT I MEAN REALLY IF IF THEIR CHILD IF THEY DON'T WANT THEIR CHILD TO READ A CERTAIN BOOK  (fe_03_06649-B-0053)
THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO TELL THE THE THE UH TEACHER LOOK I I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT BOOK  (fe_03_06649-B-0054)
I DON'T WANT MY CHILD READING THAT AND AND MOST TEACHERS FOR THE MOST PART WILL BE GLAD TO TO UH YOU KNOW SAY WELL YOU HAVE AN OPTION LET YOUR CHILD PICK ANOTHER BOOK AND THERE'S USUALLY NOT A PROBLEM  (fe_03_06649-B-0055)
YEAH I I MEAN I SOMETIMES I THINK THERE IS MUCH TOO MUCH MADE OVER  (fe_03_06649-B-0056)
AND BY THEM YOU KNOW MAKING SUCH A BIG DEAL OF IT ALL IT DOES IS JUST MAKE THE PROBLEM A LOT BIGGER THAN IT NEEDS TO BE  (fe_03_06649-B-0057)
NO WHICH IS IT WHAT WHAT'S THE NAME OF IT I  (fe_03_06649-B-0058)
YES  (fe_03_06649-B-0061)
I YOU KNOW EVEN SOMETIMES IN IN THE CASE OF THAT  (fe_03_06649-B-0062)
IF IT'S NOT YOU KNOW JUST REALLY TOO CONTROVERSIAL FOR THE PARENTS IT MIGHT BE GOOD SOMETIMES TO TAKE THE BOOK AND READ IT WITH THE CHILD  (fe_03_06649-B-0063)
AND YOU KNOW THEN IF YOU HAVE HAVE UH THE PARENT HAS PROBLEMS WITH IT THEN THEY COULD EXPLAIN TO THEIR CHILD THIS IS WHAT I DON'T LIKE THIS IS WHAT I DISAGREE WITH THEN AT LEAST SOMETIMES THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY'RE  (fe_03_06649-B-0064)
KIND OF  (fe_03_06649-B-0065)
ALIENATED FROM EVERYBODY ELSE AS FAR AS THE YOU KNOW NOT READING OR READING SOMETHING  (fe_03_06649-B-0066)
BUT BUT I THINK THAT ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY GET OLDER THEY'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO IT ANYWAY BECAUSE THEY  (fe_03_06649-B-0067)
PEER PRESSURE'S VERY STRONG I MEAN I WORKED IN  (fe_03_06649-B-0068)
