HI I'M REBECCA  (fe_03_06633-A-0001)
HI LORI DID YOU CATCH THE QUESTION  (fe_03_06633-A-0002)
MHM  (fe_03_06633-A-0004)
OH I KNOW  (fe_03_06633-A-0005)
MHM  (fe_03_06633-A-0006)
MHM  (fe_03_06633-A-0007)
MHM  (fe_03_06633-A-0008)
YEAH I KNOW I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN MINE'S ONLY IN FOURTH GRADE  (fe_03_06633-A-0009)
BUT I LOOK AT IT [MN]  (fe_03_06633-A-0010)
I READ A LOT  (fe_03_06633-A-0011)
SO I'M ALWAYS GETTING  (fe_03_06633-A-0012)
DIFFERENT TYPES OF READING MATERIAL  (fe_03_06633-A-0013)
AND WITH ME IT'S NOT SO MUCH THE READING MATERIAL AS IT IS WHAT THEY SEE ON T._V. THEIR VIDEO GAMES THEIR MUSIC  (fe_03_06633-A-0014)
UM IF THEY'RE GETTING IT ALL THAT WAY [COUGH]  (fe_03_06633-A-0015)
[MN] CENSORING THE READING AND STUFF IS NOT REALLY GOING TO DO ANY GOOD RIGHT  (fe_03_06633-A-0016)
THE RATED C._D.'S  (fe_03_06633-A-0017)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06633-A-0018)
[LAUGHTER] I KNOW THAT THE OLD  (fe_03_06633-A-0019)
YEAH YOU CAN  (fe_03_06633-A-0020)
YEAH  (fe_03_06633-A-0022)
WELL WITH CENSORSHIP ON WHAT THE KIDS ARE READING  (fe_03_06633-A-0023)
THE WAY I LOOK AT IT IS THAT WRITING A BOOK  (fe_03_06633-A-0024)
IS AN ART  (fe_03_06633-A-0025)
IN AND OF ITSELF IT REQUIRES A HUGE AMOUNT OF EXPERTISE TO WRITE A BOOK  (fe_03_06633-A-0026)
IT'S NOT LIKE MUSIC THAT THEY JUST RAP OUT WHATEVER IT IS THEY WANT TO RAP OUT NOW THEY THIS TAKES IT TAKES A CERTAIN TYPE OF GRAMMAR AND IT REALLY TAKES THEY'VE TAKEN THE LANGUAGE AND THEY'VE TURNED IT INTO SOMETHING THAT A KID CAN READ ABOUT  (fe_03_06633-A-0027)
AH AS A MATTER OF FACT I'M READING THE BOOK LUCKY NOW  (fe_03_06633-A-0028)
AND  (fe_03_06633-A-0029)
UM HOLD ON A SECOND AND I'LL TELL YOU  (fe_03_06633-A-0030)
AH THAT WOULD BE ALICE SEBALD  (fe_03_06633-A-0031)
UM IT'S ABOUT HER EXPERIENCES AS AS A RAPE VICTIM  (fe_03_06633-A-0032)
NOW I HAVE A DAUGHTER THAT'S BEEN RAPED  (fe_03_06633-A-0033)
AND THAT'S YOU KNOW IT IT'S ENOUGH TO KNOW  (fe_03_06633-A-0034)
THAT  (fe_03_06633-A-0035)
YOUR MOM HAS BEEN THROUGH IT  (fe_03_06633-A-0036)
BUT IT'S DIFFERENT WHEN THEY SIT DOWN AND THEY CAN ACTUALLY GO THROUGH PIECE BY PIECE THE SAME SCENARIO WITH SOMEONE ELSE AND IF A CHILD SITS DOWN SOMETIMES GIVING THEM A BOOK  (fe_03_06633-A-0037)
WILL BRING IT BACK OUT OF THEM  (fe_03_06633-A-0038)
ALSO THE SAME WITH MUSIC  (fe_03_06633-A-0039)
IT'S ALL IN HOW IT'S BEING USED IF THE SCHOOL THE SCHOOL DOES CENSOR MOST OF THE STUFF THAT THESE KIDS ARE READING  (fe_03_06633-A-0040)
BUT I'D RATHER THEM GET THE PROPER EDUCATION SOMEWHERE  (fe_03_06633-A-0041)
UM THAN [MN] THE GUTTER TALK THAT I HEAR  (fe_03_06633-A-0042)
UM LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE REALITY OF THE SITUATION IS AND LET'S TALK ABOUT IT IT'S THE SAME WITH MOVIES I DON'T SUBSCRIBE TO THOSE VIDEO GAMES BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY I CAN MAKE THAT A REALITY  (fe_03_06633-A-0043)
AH THERE'S NO WAY I CAN EXPLAIN THAT TO ANY OF THE CHILDREN THAT COME INTO MY HOUSE AND UNDER MY CARE THERE'S NO WAY I CAN EXPLAIN THAT  (fe_03_06633-A-0044)
MHM  (fe_03_06633-A-0046)
WELL I GREW UP ABOUT TEN YEARS BEHIND YOU  (fe_03_06633-A-0047)
SO I GREW UP WITH THE DRUGS THE SEX THE BOOZE  (fe_03_06633-A-0048)
ALL OF THAT STUFF AND I WOULD RATHER THESE KIDS READ ABOUT IT IN A BOOK AND FIND OUT THE CONCLUSIONS OF EVERYTHING  (fe_03_06633-A-0049)
AND FIND OUT THE TRUTH 'CAUSE THE TRUTH IS ALL RELEVANT  (fe_03_06633-A-0050)
AND I WOULD RATHER THEM FIND THE TRUTH FROM SOMEBODY ELSE'S EXPERIENCES BECAUSE I KNOW AS A KID AND I'M I'M PRETTY SURE IF YOU LOOK BACK AND YOU CAN REMEMBER IT AS A KID THAT WE ALWAYS QUESTIONED WHAT OUR PARENTS HAD TO SAY TO US  (fe_03_06633-A-0051)
LIKE OH YOU HAVE NO CLUE WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT UM A- AND THE MORE YOU TRIED TO PRESS ON WITH IT  (fe_03_06633-A-0052)
THE AH THE MORE  (fe_03_06633-A-0053)
BREAKDOWN IN COMMUNICATION THERE WAS I LEARNED A LONG TIME AGO WORKING WITH THESE KIDS  (fe_03_06633-A-0054)
THAT I WOULD RATHER SAY OKAY IF THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT TO DO BEFORE YOU GO DO THIS READ THIS BOOK  (fe_03_06633-A-0055)
AND THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE BETTER JUDGMENTS ON THEIR OWN  (fe_03_06633-A-0056)
HAVING [MN] GONE THROUGH THE BOOK AND LIVED THE EXPERIENCE WITH THAT PERSON  (fe_03_06633-A-0057)
BECAUSE THE BOOKS  (fe_03_06633-A-0058)
MAKE YOU USE YOUR IMAGINATION IT MAKES YOU SIT THERE WITH THAT PERSON  (fe_03_06633-A-0059)
CENSORING THE STUFF IN A LOT OF WAYS LEAVES THE CHILDREN INCAPABLE OF HANDLING SOME OF THE WORST ATROCITIES KNOWN TO MANKIND  (fe_03_06633-A-0060)
AND TO ME IT'S IT'S A FORM OF NEGLECT  (fe_03_06633-A-0061)
YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT PREPARING THESE KIDS FOR THE REAL WORLD THE WORLD DOES NOT  (fe_03_06633-A-0062)
YOU KNOW OUR WORLD WAS NOT PEACHY KEEN  (fe_03_06633-A-0063)
BUT IT'S GETTING WORSE AND IT'S NOT JUST THE KIDS IT'S THE PARENTS  (fe_03_06633-A-0064)
YEAH  (fe_03_06633-A-0066)
SO CENS- WHAT WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WE'RE GOING TO CENSOR THESE KIDS WHAT THEY READ MY GOD THEY LIVE IT  (fe_03_06633-A-0067)
LET 'EM READ IT LET 'EM GET THE EXPERIENCE FIRST SO NO I DON'T AGREE WITH CENSORSHIP  (fe_03_06633-A-0068)
