OKAY  (fe_03_06623-B-0006)
OF CENSORSHIP OF BOOKS  (fe_03_06623-B-0007)
YES I DO  (fe_03_06623-B-0010)
WELL I BELIEVE THERE ARE BOOKS OUT THERE THAT CHILDREN SHOULDN'T BE READING  (fe_03_06623-B-0011)
BECAUSE I THINK IT AH CAUSES THEM THEY READ THINGS IN BOOKS AND THEY THINK THAT THEY CAN DO THEM AND THEY WANT TO FOLLOW SUIT WHEN THEY GET OLDER EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD I THOUGHT EVEN SIXTEEN YEARS OLD  (fe_03_06623-B-0012)
IF THEY DECIDE TO READ THEM THEN THEY CAN READ THEM BUT UNTIL THEY'RE MATURE ENOUGH TO SEPARATE FACT FROM FANTASY NO  (fe_03_06623-B-0013)
THAT'S THE WAY HOW I FEEL ABOUT IT  (fe_03_06623-B-0014)
I THINK IT SHOULD BE YOU KNOW WHEN A SCHOOL STARTS MAKING UP A BOOK LIST RIGHT THAT CHILDREN READ THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE PARENTS PARTICIPATE IN IT  (fe_03_06623-B-0015)
YOU KNOW I THINK YOU KNOW MORE PARENT PARTICIPATION  (fe_03_06623-B-0016)
PARENT OR GUARDIAN OR WHATEVER PARTICIPATION  (fe_03_06623-B-0017)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06623-B-0018)
RIGHT RIGHT WELL THAT'S YOU KNOW I FEEL THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO SAY NO YOU KNOW THIS BOOK IS NOT PROPER FOR YOU  (fe_03_06623-B-0019)
AH THEN IF A PARENT FEELS IF THEY DECIDE OH WELL THAT BOOK IS PROPER WELL I THINK THE PARENT  (fe_03_06623-B-0020)
SHOULD BE ABLE BE AUTHORIZED TO BE ABLE TO SAY NO I DON'T WANT MY CHILD READING THAT BOOK THIS IS THE BOOK THAT I WANT MY CHILD TO READ AND NOT HAVE THE TEACHER SAY WELL YOU KNOW YOU GOT TO READ MY BOOK  (fe_03_06623-B-0021)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06623-B-0022)
WELL I I FEEL THAT PARENTS HAVE GIVEN SCHOOLS TOO MUCH AUTHORITY  (fe_03_06623-B-0023)
I FEEL THAT THEY'VE GIVEN THEM TOO MUCH AUTHORITY  (fe_03_06623-B-0024)
AH THEY HAVE TO PARTICIPATE I HAVE A GRANDDAUGHTER IN PRIVATE SCHOOL  (fe_03_06623-B-0025)
AND ONE OF US IS THERE AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK  (fe_03_06623-B-0026)
AT THE SCHOOL  (fe_03_06623-B-0027)
WE'RE THERE AT THE SCHOOL MONITORING CLASSES BEING A CLASS PARENT A CLASSROOM PARENT  (fe_03_06623-B-0028)
WELL THAT'S A PARENT THAT COMES IN AND HELPS AND ASSISTS WITH THE TEACHER  (fe_03_06623-B-0030)
AND UM I AM THE ADOPTED GRANDMOTHER OF THE CLASS  (fe_03_06623-B-0031)
SO YOU KNOW WHEN I WALK IN THE DOOR GRANDMA YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06623-B-0032)
BUT YOU KNOW I MEAN  (fe_03_06623-B-0033)
UH WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY PROBLEM WITH THE BOOKS BECAUSE SHE GOES TO A RELIGIOUS AH PRIVATE SCHOOL  (fe_03_06623-B-0034)
AND WE HAVEN'T HAD YOU KNOW TOO MUCH PROBLEM THERE WERE SOME PARENTS THAT DID NOT LIKE THE IDEA THAT THEY WERE STUDYING ABOUT DINOSAURS BUT ONCE THE TEACHER SAT DOWN AND EXPLAINED TO THEM WHY THEY WERE DOING DINOSAURS  (fe_03_06623-B-0035)
IT WASN'T A PROBLEM BUT I THINK YOU KNOW IT SHOULD BE MORE PARENT TEACHER COMMUNICATION I DON'T THINK THERE'S ENOUGH  (fe_03_06623-B-0036)
RIGHT AS DEROGATORY WELL LIKE I SAY AND ANOTHER THING THERE ARE BOOKS OUT THERE THAT MAYBE I DON'T PARTICULARLY LIKE BUT I THINK WOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER TO READ THOUGH WHEN SHE'S READING THEM  (fe_03_06623-B-0038)
I'D BE SURE THAT EITHER HER OR HER MOTHER OR HER FATHER OR HER GRANDFATHER SOMEBODY ELSE HAS REVIEWED IT SO THAT WHEN SHE ASKS QUESTIONS WE CAN PROPERLY  (fe_03_06623-B-0039)
ANSWER THE QUESTIONS  (fe_03_06623-B-0040)
AND YOU KNOW YOU JUST DON'T GIVE A CHILD A BOOK AND SAY HERE GO READ YOU NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S IN THAT BOOK  (fe_03_06623-B-0041)
NO THEY DON'T THEY THEY HAVE TH- THEY DON'T KNOW THEY DON'T KNOW WELL MY CHILD GOT A BOOK TO DO GOT TO DO A BOOK REPORT AND THEY CAN'T EVEN  (fe_03_06623-B-0042)
WORK WITH THE CHILD AND KIND OF I MEAN THE CHILD SHOULD BE DOING THE BOOK REPORT BUT THE PARENT SHOULD HAVE  (fe_03_06623-B-0043)
YOU KNOW SHOULD KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING  (fe_03_06623-B-0044)
YOU KNOW JUST LIKE RIGHT NOW MY DAUGHTER IS DOING HER END OF GRADE UM REPORT WHICH INCLUDES ENGLISH HISTORY AND A COUPLE OTHER SUBJECTS  (fe_03_06623-B-0045)
AND I LOOKED AT IT AND SAID OH THAT'S A LOT UNTIL MY DAUGHTER SAID WELL MOM THIS IS WHAT SHE'S BEEN DOING ALL YEAR SO SHE WENT THROUGH WELL SHE'S I WAS OH WELL SHE CAN DO IT SO WE WENT ON THE COMPUTER TODAY AND SHE GOT SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT SHE NEEDS  (fe_03_06623-B-0046)
YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06623-B-0047)
THIRD GRADE  (fe_03_06623-B-0048)
THIRD GRADE AND THEY HAVE TO DO A REPORT ON THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA THEY HAD TO KNOW WHAT WHAT WHAT AH THEY NEE- HAD TO NAME THREE STATES THAT'S IN THE PIEDMONT  (fe_03_06623-B-0049)
THREE STATES THAT'S IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY AND THE COASTAL STATES  (fe_03_06623-B-0050)
SO SHE WENT ON THE COMPUTER AND YOU KNOW HER AND I WORKED ON IT TOGETHER  (fe_03_06623-B-0051)
WELL  (fe_03_06623-B-0052)
I PUT IT LIKE THIS I HAVE A  (fe_03_06623-B-0053)
I BASICALLY WITHIN MY HOUSE I HAVE WHAT THEY I CALL A HOMEWORK CENTER  (fe_03_06623-B-0054)
AND I WORK WITH FOUR OR FIVE OTHER KIDS DOING THE SAME THING  (fe_03_06623-B-0055)
THE PARENTS CLAIM THEY DON'T HAVE TIME BUT PUT IT LIKE THAT WHEN MY KIDS CAME UP I HAD MADE TIME  (fe_03_06623-B-0056)
AND BUT MOST PEOPLE EXPECT THE SCHOOL TO DO IT AND IT'S NOT THE SCHOOL'S RESPONSIBILITY YOU HAVE TO TAKE SOME RESPONSIBILITY IF MY CHILD WAS NOT LEARNING I CAN'T BLAME THAT TEACHER I HAVE TO TAKE SOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT  (fe_03_06623-B-0057)
YEAH HARRY POTTER  (fe_03_06623-B-0058)
WELL I HAVE  (fe_03_06623-B-0059)
I HAVEN'T READ THE TOTAL BOOK BUT I'VE YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06623-B-0060)
AH RIGHT NOW MY DAUGHT- GRANDDAUGHTER HAS NO INTEREST IN IT BECAUSE SHE'S SEEN CLIPS OF IT ON T._V. AND SHE DIDN'T LIKE IT  (fe_03_06623-B-0061)
BUT I THINK BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF IN THERE THAT TO ME IT JUST YOU KNOW I MEAN  (fe_03_06623-B-0062)
LIKE THE LITTLE BOY THAT HAD READ HARRY POTTER AND THOUGHT THAT HE COULD GET ON A BROOMSTICK AND FLY AWAY  (fe_03_06623-B-0063)
AND HE GOT UP ON A COUNTER TOP WITH A BROOM STICK AND HURT HIMSELF THINGS LIKE THIS  (fe_03_06623-B-0064)
SEPARATING FACT FROM REALITY FACT FROM FANTASY  (fe_03_06623-B-0065)
AND LIKE I SAY  (fe_03_06623-B-0066)
HE DIDN'T KNOW ANY BETTER HE'S SEEN IT ON TELEVISION HE FIGURED OH YEAH I CAN DO THAT  (fe_03_06623-B-0067)
MHM  (fe_03_06623-B-0068)

UH MARY POPPINS WHEN HE WAS YOUNG  (fe_03_06623-B-0070)
AND HE THOUGHT HE COULD JUMP OFF THE RAILINGS BUT I DIDN'T TAKE HIM SOMEONE ELSE HAD TAKEN HIM AND DIDN'T EXPLAIN SO HEY THAT'S FANTASY HE JUMPED OFF THE PORCH WITH THE UMBRELLA AND STUCK THE UMBRELLA IN HIS EYE  (fe_03_06623-B-0071)
AND SO YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06623-B-0072)
THAT'S WHEN I STARTED TO REALISE THAT YOU GOT TO EXPLAIN THINGS TO CHILDREN HEY THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE I LIKE IT I ENJOY IT BUT THAT'S NOT REALITY YOU CANNOT YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06623-B-0073)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06623-B-0074)
YOU KNOW THAT IS THAT IS WHERE A  (fe_03_06623-B-0075)
LOT OF THIS STUFF BECAME REALITY TO ME I NEVER PAID IT NO MIND BUT AND SO HE HAS A SPOT IN HIS EYE WHERE HE WILL HAVE I MEAN HE'S FORTY SEVEN YEARS OLD NOW BUT HE STILL HAS THAT SPOT WHERE IT'S LIKE BLIND SPOT IN HIS EYE  (fe_03_06623-B-0076)
AND HE WAS ONLY ABOUT SIX SIX OR SEVEN WHEN HE DID IT  (fe_03_06623-B-0077)
AND [MN] SURE I BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD TRY THINGS BUT AT THE SAME TIME THEY HAVE TO BE CAUTIONED THAT COULD BE DANGEROUS YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06623-B-0078)
