L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  I'm all right.  How are you?
R:  Oh, I'm fine.  Um, well, I don't know exactly how this works but, uh, why don't you start talking about your pets?
L:  Um, I have several pets.  I have a dog, three cats, um, a hamster and two rabbits.
R:  Wow.  I- --
L:  And we spend lots of time with our pets.
R:  What, uh, what kind of dog is it?
L:  [LIPSMACK] American bulldog.
R:  Ow, well.  Now, see, I'm a little more partial to beagles.
L:  Little d- -- the little dogs?
R:  Less mess to clean up. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Yes.  Well, they're nice, small, family dogs.
R:  Um, well, that's good.  What kind of cats do you have?
L:  Um, just regular cats.  Nothing -- no purebredness to them, just cats.
R:  [several inaudible words] too, by the way. [LAUGH] I'm just --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [several inaudible words] --
L:  Do you cats or just dogs?
R:  No, actually, I don't have any pets.
L:  No pets?
R:  So -- no, unfortunately I have a job where I have to work a lot so it's tough to ... I have trouble e- -- keeping, uh, even plants alive so ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I would prefer not to risk the life of something, uh, more -- somewhat more sentient than a plant.
L:  But you would have a pet if you could?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I haven't really decided what kind of pet I would like.  I mean, um ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Like, dogs are good but, you know, cats are, uh, at least a li- -- they seem like they're a little more self sufficient.
L:  Yes, they are.  It's nice to be able to go away for a weekend, just leave some food and water out for them and they pretty much take care of themselves.
R:  Now, they don't fight with the dog?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, they hate the dog.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And the dog just is a big, you know, galumph.  She just wants to play with the cats and ... but the cats hate her, so ...
R:  And the cats aren't particularly interested in that?
L:  Oh, they hate her, no.
R:  Now -- but do the cats, like, tear up --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the house and claw everything or do [inaudible] --
L:  No, the cats are pretty good.  They're -- they're older cats, they're not kittens, so ... um, they -- they're, uh, they're pretty good.  They just don't like the dogs though.  Any time the dog is around, [SIGH] they fight with her, but otherwise ... the dog is outside and they're inside.
R:  Oh, okay, so that's, uh -- well, that's a little bit different then.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  'Cause it seems like it'd be tough for them to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- coexist in the same space.  But I guess it just depends on the personality of the pets involved.
L:  Yeah.  Well, the cats were here first, so it's their territory, you know.
R:  R- -- okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] And how about -- have -- do they -- have they ever tried to eat the hamster? [LAUGH]
L:  Um, no, the- -- well, they were curious when we first got the hamster but no, they're, um ... they don't tr- -- they -- they leave the hamster alone.  The dog would probably try to eat the hamster if -- if he could.  I -- I think -- and one -- once the hamster did get out and, uh, one of the cats sniffed it out, which was rather funny.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah --
L:  That's how we found it. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, actually I -- the last pets I did have was when I was a kid I did have hamsters for a while, so ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  ... that are, um -- uh, but the one I had, the last one I had was constantly escaping, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're, uh -- they can literally chew their way out of virtually anything.
L:  Yeah.  They sure can. [MN]
R:  Well, let's see.  Well, that's good.  Um, so what other -- you had, uh, you had a hamster and then what were your other pets?
L:  There's the two rabbits, which are, uh, you know, they don't get a l- -- 'cause those are the ones that don't really get played with much.  They're not really playful animals, they don't really want much attention.
R:  Right.
L:  They like to be just in their cage alone.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  The hamster likes th- -- likes to come out and gets a lot of attention from -- from the kids, and the cats get attention from the kids.  The dog is ... isn't -- ge- gets attentions from the adults, mostly.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Actually, I remember the hamster -- well, I used to take my hamster out on the lawn and they really, um, they really like it out there 'cause they, like, for example eat the clover.
L:  Mhm.  I haven't done that yet, but we've only had the hamster for maybe a month.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I'd give it a try but -- 'cause I remember my hamster, he, uh, basically, he was -- it was, like, you know, first -- for the first few minutes of course he'd be scared or whatever and then he'd just start sniffing and then he'd hit these patches of clover and stuff his cheeks so full that --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, he could barely walk. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  It would be -- that would be fun.  I should, uh, let my son do that.  He'd probably enjoy that.
R:  Yeah, so what, uh, what, um -- why do you have so many pets?  Is it 'cause you have a lot of kids and ...?
L:  Um, no, I only have one son, um, but, uh, I don't know, I've just always loved animals.  Mostly cats I started out with the cats and then I always had wanted an American bulldog so I finally got one a couple of years ago.  But, uh, she's a lot of -- she needs a lot of attention and a lot of work so she's hard.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then we just got the hamster, so -- and the rabbits have been around for a while but [LIPSMACK] they don't really get much attention.
R:  [LAUGH] Do you keep the rabbits outside?
L:  Th- -- no, they're in the garage, actually.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  It's too hot where I live for them to really be able to live outside.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't know, I've heard people have had rabbits as pets but they, like, uh -- s- some people have said -- I've read stuff that, you know, that sometimes they can make really good pets.
L:  Oh, yeah, they -- they can walk arou- -- well, I tried at first, you know, the -- having the ca- -- the rabbit just walk around the house like a c- -- a cat would.
R:  Right.
L:  But he just -- she, actually, she chewed just everything in sight.
R:  Oh.
L:  You know, ev- -- you know, she'd ... ah, I -- I guess they're supposedly not that difficult to train, to box train and -- and stuff like that but I just [SIGH] ah, didn't wanna put all that effort in [LAUGH] into it so she's just a cat -- I mean, she's just a caged rabbit, she doesn't wander around.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, well, I don't know.  Yeah, I'll -- eventually I'll get some pets but --
L:  Mm.
R:  It's, uh -- I don't know, like I said, I'd like to keep the plants alive first and --
L:  Mm.  I can't imagine not having pets though.  I'll -- I'll -- especially my cats mostly, I just -- I have to sleep with them every night. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] The, uh, they don't, like, uh, end up on your face? [LAUGH]
L:  No, no, they'll just lay beside me and ... one of them i- -- will let me put his -- put my arm around him and it's nice.  But --
R:  Uh, now, in terms of the three, do they have, like, uh, is there a one that's dominant or are they territorial?
L:  Yeah, there is.  There's the big -- big giant male cat.  He's sort of [LAUGH] king.  And then there's his brother who's, I don't know, you know, not so dominant, and quiet and shy.  And then there's the female, who's not related to them but she's, uh, she's more of the mouser, she likes to go after the bugs and the m- -- any, you know, the hamster or the ... she's -- she's not really, uh, dominant in any sort of way.
R:  Yeah.  Well, it sounds like, I mean, that, you know, mainly it would probably be the two males that would fight if anything and ...
L:  Um, no.  They -- they chase each other around sometimes but, um, no, they don't really fight, they just -- the -- but the big cat, he's -- he's the one who hates the dog the most.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And he'll, uh ... he just won't put up with the dog at all.  The other cats will sit and just sort of ignore the dog if the dog comes up to them.  H- -- they'll at him but th- the, uh, the big male cat, he'll actually go up to the dog and tease him -- uh, tease her through the door -- through the sliding glass door and just pick fights.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Which is -- it's humorous, actually.
R:  [LAUGH] Ah, that's pretty funny.  Now, do you buy these, uh, guys a lot of toys at, like, Pets' Mart or those kinds of places?
L:  Yeah, we -- we've bought a lot of, uh, we've bought a lot of stuff for both the cats and the dog.  The dog -- the dog uses hers; the cats don't really use theirs at all.  They'd rather just dart around a piece of paper. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But the -- the dogs loves anything that we get her. [NOISE] She -- especially balls, the balls they have with tethers on them now.
R:  Oh, right, mhm.
L:  [NOISE] She loves those.  She's deadly with them though. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] She'll swing them round.  She'll hit you with them and, uh, yeah, that hurts.  But she loves the -- loves those the most.
R:  How about, like, catnip?  Do you give them catnip?  Do they --
L:  No.
R:  Oh --
L:  No, they -- they never -- I tried; they never seemed interested in it, really.
R:  Ah.
L:  [NOISE] So no catnip for them, just ... [NOISE] but they love their -- their little soft treat type of things and --
R:  Oh, right.
L:  Like the -- they like the treats and the canned food, they all c- -- whenever I give the dog canned food they're all -- the cats are right there too.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So [SIGH] ...
R:  Yeah, well, it sounds like they have, uh -- what are the, uh, what are the -- what have you named the pets?
L:  Um, well [LAUGH] my -- when we first got the two male cats they, uh, my son was rather young so they're Pooh and Tigger. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  And then the -- the female cat is Sweetie Pie.  Um, so, I'm not sure why we named her that because she's rather not that sweet. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  To put it nicely.  Um, the dog is Willow.
R:  Okay.
L:  And the hamster is Teddy and the [LIPSMACK] what are the names of [LAUGH] the rabbits are Annie and Thumper.
R:  Okay.  Well, yeah, I -- you would expect Thumper.
L:  Thumper, yep, typical name for a rabbit I probably would guess.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, no, there's, uh, well, it sounds like there's a lot of Winnie the Pooh, uh, oriented, uh, names in there.
L:  Yeah, there are [LAUGH] a couple, yep.  But, you know, that's what my son was into --
