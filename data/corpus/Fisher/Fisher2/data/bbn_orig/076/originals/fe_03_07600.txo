R:  Yeah, I watch, uh, basketball and I watch the NBA finals and all that.  That's about it.
L:  Did you watch the final?
R:  Yes I did.
L:  Yeah, oh you -- are you a -- are you a Knicks fan?  Or a Spurs fan?
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I wanted Knicks to win so that we could have, you know, another match and then, uh, that would have been, like, you know, uh, hopefully it would have been a very close one just like the last one.  And --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- and I wanted the Knicks to win but, um, I guess the Spurs so much better.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Definitely. I mean --
R:  Towards the end they were actually -- I mean, all throughout they were neck and neck but, uh, towards the end they -- they played so well.
L:  They -- toward the end --
R:  And of course football was there too.
L:  -- I mean towards the end the Knicks just -- they just sucked.  That's basically what happened.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  They really just broke down.
R:  And, uh, yeah I think that was because of the crowd support and all the --
L:  Yeah, it was -- it was a lot of things.
R:  -- uh, cheering
L:  It was a lot of things, I mean, people just -- the Knicks just weren't making shots.  They had to make the shots and they weren't making it.  That was the problem.
R:  Yeah.  They missed -- towards the end they missed all of their shots.  It was just so shocking.
L:  They were getting blocked.  They were getting blocked ridiculously.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Just -- just constantly and it was just -- it was just sad watching it.
R:  I know.
L:  I'll be honest, I was -- I was just -- I'm a Knicks fan.  I'm a huge Knicks fan, I'm from New York, you know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I know the Knicks sucker now whatever but, um, you know, I was rooting for the Knicks but, yeah, they -- they really broke down.
R:  Yeah, even I was rooting for the Knicks.
L:  Yeah, it was -- it was kinda sad.  It was kinda sad watching them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh, I mean, yeah, I watched a lot of -- I don't know, I guess we're just supposed to talk about sports on TV.  I watch a lot of sports, uh, on TV except for hockey.  I watch pretty much everything else.
R:  Oh, okay.  Ah, well, I just watch, uh, that and I -- I am actually a big fan of, um, tennis too.
L:  [COUGH] Tennis.  Yeah, I like women's tennis.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, yeah.
L:  Women's tennis is fun.  Men's tennis, whatever.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I know, Stephie Graff was my favorite.  And, uh --
L:  And I think I like -- I like, Anna Kournikova.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] Oh, yeah --
L:  I like, Anna Kourni- --
R:  -- she's good, right.  Not so good on the field as she's off.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well she's -- she's not that good professionally but just in general she's good to watch.  [LAUGH] 
R:  She's -- yes.  Oh, yes she's beautiful.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, she's good to watch in general.  But, um, yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  And, um, um, and I watch a lot of, uh, cricket.  I don't know whether you know that game or not.
L:  I know cricket.  I don't watch it but I know what it is.  Definitely, yeah.
R:  Yeah, it's like baseball. But I think it's much more interesting and fun because, um, every ball there's a run scored and, you know, you're, like, you know, something is happening.  Not like baseball where, you know, they just keep missing, missing, missing and --
L:  Okay.  Okay.  I think it --
R:  -- and so --
L:  -- yeah, crick- -- yeah.  I mean, I've seen it, I really have not gotten into it or anything. I mean, it's not too popular I guess round here.
R:  It's not popular this -- this part of the world but it is from where I come and it's so --
L:  In India?
R:  -- popular that people -- people would take off from their work just --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- to watch a game and --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- there's -- on TV --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- not -- not to go in -- in the --
L:  All right.  Even at -- not even at the game? 
R:  -- [several inaudible words] in a proper live thing but --
L:  Okay.  Yeah just to watch it on TV
R:  -- Yeah.
L:  Oh.
R:  But that's how popular it is.
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  And it's -- people would even kill [LAUGH] --
L:  That's pr- -- yeah.  [several inaudible words] 
R:  -- ah, for the game.  It's like that so --
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- um, it's a very popular game and if -- if you follow it, it's so interesting that you -- you get hooked.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  But it's not played here so I understand why Americans don't watch it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I mean, you don't watch any other type of sport like football maybe?
R:  No.
L:  No.  Not at all?  Well, no, I don't reflect --
R:  I don't like football at all.
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I mean, I find it a total waste of time.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Do you really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow!
R:  I mean, the --
L:  It's amazing -- it's amazing how, you know, I guess one person can see it that way, and another person can see it as something totally different.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Totally different.
R:  [LAUGH] I know.
L:  It's a waste of time to you but it's, you know, it's very interesting [MN] [several inaudible words] you know, a lot of other people.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I guess that's, I mean, it's -- I'm, I mean, I never watched that game much and I don't really follow it.  I mean, I follow it but I don't find it interesting and --
L:  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, that's understandable Yeah.  I mean, I don't know too many women that, uh --
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:   follow any type of sport really.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Maybe a little bit of basketball -- maybe a little basketball, maybe a little baseball.  Not really football though.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I don't know.
R:  Um, so what do you think about the coverage on TV?
L:  Coverage?  What did you say?  Um --  
R:  On TV?  Sports coverage on TV?  What do you think about that?
L:  Uh, what do you mean?  In what -- what sense?
R:  Like, do you think the coverage that you get, uh, is good and it's, um, um --
L:  Well, I think it, um I don't know, like, okay, if you want to go specifically, NBA -- NBA, basketball --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, they cha- -- um, they went to ABC, the company --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ABC.  And they -- they totally changed.  They used to be on NBC.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Now they're on ABC.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I see a totally different, um, [LIPSMACK] it's a totally different structure, it's totally different -- the way they're running is totally different.  Like, I really pay attention to these things.  On NBC --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it was more about basketball, you know.  At half time they would show things about basketball.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And if you -- if you watch carefully this year, especially in the finals, at the half time, they show to- -- last -- on Sunday night they showed things about upcoming movies.  You know, nothing to do with basketball.  It's all advertising.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They're just trying to advertise movies coming up.  They don't have anything to do with the game.  I found that really disappointing.  Um, it's basically all -- it's all about just marketing and, you know --
R:  Yeah, money.
L:  Just trying to -- Yeah, it's all about money --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- basically it's -- it's not about really the game as much any more.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Channel seven, uh, I don't like the way they're doing it.  Channel four was the good stuff basically.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Uh, but coverage -- coverage wise, it's -- it's decent.  Overall, in a- all sports it's decent.  It's like, not bad.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE] 
L:  I can't complain.  They're doing good -- doing what they have to do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But this -- there's little things here and there that I just, you know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L: I don't know.  What abut you?
