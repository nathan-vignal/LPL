L:  Oh, hi.  My name's Keith Kowalski.
R:  Hi, I'm Keisha Daniel.
L:  Oh, how are you doing?
R:  [NOISE] I'm okay.  Where are you coming from?
L:  I'm calling from Albuquerque, New Mexico.
R:  Oh, okay.  New York.
L:  Uh, New York, what part?
R:  [NOISE] Um, I live in the Bronx --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- it- -- it's the city, New York City.
L:  Okay, yeah, I know, my, uh -- my wife is from, uh, a little town outside of, uh, Passaic called Garfield, New Jersey --
R:  Oh, okay. [NOISE] 
L:  -- so I've been into, uh, New York --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- City many, many times.
R:  Many times, all right.
L:  Yeah, so I suppose --
R:  The last person I talked to was like, "Oh, New York, great". [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] Yeah, oh no, my mom -- my mom's from upstate New York.  She was, uh -- was in a place called --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Fort Montgomery by the Military Academy up there.
R:  Oh, okay. [NOISE]
L:  Uh, so, yeah, New York, I'm -- I'm not -- not a stranger to it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so --
R:  All right then.
L:  Uh, so I guess we're supposed to talk about life partners.
R:  Yes, what's the most important --
L:  Wh- wh- what --
R:  -- thing.
L:  What's the most important thing, so --
R:  For me?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I guess it would have to be, uh, like, companionship, to actually be able to stand the person constantly every day [NOISE] -- a friend, [NOISE] kind of like, someone you can talk to.
L:  I'm in touch with that emotion. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] You know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, but, actually, you know -- like with my parents, they're really funny 'cause in their relationship they -- it's weird how my father so detached from expressing emotional anything --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that is like -- and my mom is, like, so emotional, she'll -- she'll be, like, filled with kisses and hugs and stuff and my father'll just sit there and be, like, "Okay, well, whatever" [SIGH] and so I definitely, like -- I wouldn't want something like that where I feel, like, if I'm putting so much more into it and not getting anything back, so definite- --
L:  How, uh -- how -- y- -- how old's your father?
R:  He's fifty seven.
L:  See, I wonder if that's, you know, 'cause --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I wonder if that's his generation though, see --
R:  [MN] That's the way he was raised, his whole family's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like that, that's the way he was raised.
L:  You m- -- yeah.  'Cause that's -- uh, I -- I agree, I mean, uh, uh, I'm -- I've been married for seven years now --
R:  Really?  Congratulations.
L:  Yeah.  Thank you.  And --
R:  How old are you?
L:  I'm thirty seven.
R:  Okay.
L:  And, uh, we, uh, uh, you know, it's, uh -- it's, you know, it's one of the things where a -- a life partner, you know, it's a marriage, it -- it's work, I mean, anybody who isn't willing to -- to work at it and, you know, meet their mate's needs, I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I do things all the time that, you know, if it was my choice, oh, heck no, I wouldn't do it, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if I  -- matter, I know it's important for my wife and so, therefore, I choose to do it.
R:  Right, for her.
L:  So, for me -- and that's, uh, I don't know, i- i- -- there's -- there's one thing for me that, you know -- that I think is probably, uh, without a doubt, the most important thing to any relationship --
R:  What's that?
L:  -- you know, and that's trust.
R:  Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
L:  And on- -- and once goes out the window and it's n- --
R:  The relationship's over.
L:  Right, and it's one of the things where you, you know -- when we -- we -- we sit down, I can tell her anything really and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I know that, you know, she won't judge me for it, she'll, you know -- she'll understand and, [MN] you know, we both have, I guess, the same, uh, moral background, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we're both, you know -- she's brought up Catholic, I'm brought up Presbyterian, but we both, you know, you know, believe in, I guess, you could say the -- the, uh, uh, you know, the, uh, Christian upbringing --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so for -- for us, uh, you know, uh, you know, we have very simple ground rules that I think are also important in a, uh -- a life partnership is -- is, you know, you have those rules that are almost unspoken --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, uh, you -- you make sure they're clear, I mean, you know, I -- I hear of people who are married, where they'll call their husband or their wife a "bastard" or a "bitch", you know, I mean, call each --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- other "motherfuckers", pardon my language, but --
R:  Right, right, right.
L:  -- and I'm, like -- "I would never call my wife that, no matter --" --
R:  Exact- -- thank you, exactly. [NOISE] 
L:  [MN] -- it's like, uh, "Have a little respect for your partner -- a little --"
R:  Exactly, like I -- like in -- please, so normal [NOISE] that you walk down the street in New York and hear, like, a wife cursing and cursing their husband out, or there's vice versa and just --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- like, total disrespect, and I'm, like, "Oh, my God, I would never speak to my boyfriend like that" like, I've been with my boyfriend for, like, four years, going on --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- five [NOISE] and I'm just, [NOISE] like, "Okay" [NOISE] the way these people talk to each other, if you ever, like, I know he wouldn't [NOISE] but, if he was to ever say something like that to me I'd be just, [NOISE] like, I -- I'd be gone in total shock --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] -- first of all, I'm like, "Okay, who the hell do you think I am?" [NOISE]
L:  Right and, I mean, who -- I mean, it -- it's like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- i- i- it's like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- "I- if you don't respect me, then who do you respect, 'cause if I'm not that important to you".
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, and -- and that kind of thing [SIGH] and I -- I -- I guess, you know, uh, as --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, how do I put this --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- my parents --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, have been divorced, uh, my mom's been divorced three times and m- my dad's been divorced twice --
R:  [NOISE] Okay. [NOISE] 
L:  -- and I've watched those marriages fall apart --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I've seen some things --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in that -- that relationship --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and some of them are, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "Where are you going with your life?"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, uh, you know, if -- if you wanna move to a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- small farm out in the country --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, you know, kind of like the -- the Green Acres --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, scenario [LAUGH] where one of them wants to live in Manhattan --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the other one wants to --
R:  Go away, right, uh-huh.
L:  -- live out in the country, uh, you know, one wants to have kids, the other one doesn't --
R:  Right. [NOISE] 
L:  -- then I think, uh -- you know, so I would say common --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- goals would be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- another, uh, key --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, factor --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to a --
R:  [NOISE] In a relationship.
L:  -- life partner.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] Right.
L:  Yeah, it's -- and I -- I mean -- and it's like, um, uh, my little brother, he, you know, he --he's a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a born again Christian, uh --
R:  He's a what?
L:  -- a born again Christian.
R:  Okay. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, and he goes to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- church, you know, [MN] uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- two nights of the week --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- he goes on Sundays --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, like, Wednesdays and then --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- he also leads the youth group --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- so, all -- all the --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- high school and college kids --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, he, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- sets up activities for 'em and that kind of stuff --
R:  [NOISE] Right. [NOISE] 
L:  -- and for him, though, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- religion and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the amount of it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is the key thing because, like, he's had girlfriends in the past going, "Oh, you know, [LIPSMACK] why don't -- why you going to the church?" you know, constantly nagging on him for doing what he --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  --you know, considers a very --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- e- essential part of his life --
R:  Right, right, right. [NOISE]
L:  -- so, you know, hi- -- yeah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I mean, it -- it's kind of funny --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when they threw the subject at me I'm like, "Uh, what in the world -- oh, okay well, I guess --" you know, I mean, you're looking at a life partner, uh, someone you're gonna spend the rest of your life with, uh, you know, uh, I -- I think those all important and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when -- when you look at the political side of it, you know, I -- I'm sure the term life partner means, you know, same sex and I -- I'm sorry, I -- I like my friends but, you know, they're -- [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- other reasons -- 
R:  [SIGH] Right.
L:  -- you, uh -- you're getting, you know, uh, you know, "Hey, my wife's --"
R:  And they want it to be politically corrate -- correct --
L:  Right, yo- --
R:  -- if they said, "You're a husband or a wife" it's kind of like eliminating --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a group of people that are kind of like, "Well, she's not my husband, she's my life partner". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, and, hey, you know, I -- I mean, uh, I'm -- I'm a religious person and I know there's people who quote things in the Bible, they'd say that that's wrong and I'm like, "You know what, it's not for me to judge" you know, that's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that -- they're happy and that kind of thing, great, uh, but, you know, for me, uh, you know, I've been with my wife for, let's see, [MN] ew, uh, twelve years now --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and, uh, the -- the sex is still great, I mean --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know, I mean, it -- which is, you know, it -- I, you know, I -- any guy who tells you that se- --
R:  Twelve years non stop -- sorry to cut you off.
L:  Uh-huh.  Pardon me?
R:  Okay, this is including -- I said, "Twelve years non stop?"
L:  Uh, yep, we've been --
R:  Like, you know how people say, "Oh, we've been together twelve years, off and on" like breaking up and coming back together --
L:  Oh, no, no --
R:  -- and breaking --
L:  -- we, uh, I -- I learned, uh, from my parents a long time ago, you know what if you break up, [MN] you're going to break up again, 'cause it, you know -- it's kind of like, you know, if my wife slapped -- if she slapped me once, she'll probably slap me again --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so, it's one of those things where, you know what if -- if you --
R:  You don't go back. [MN]
L:  -- break up, break up and it's over --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, uh, you're going to find another reason to break up later, so, uh, you know, that's, I guess, one of my wife's, uh, and I -- little unspoken rule that's -- we don't bring up the word divorce, we don't even joke about it, like --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- "Oh, if you do this, I'm going to divorce you, ha ha ha" you know, no -- it -- that -- that's not a word that we talk about.
R:  Right.
L:  So, it's, uh -- so, things, I guess, uh, over the years we've developed, uh, a lot of little rules that, uh, make our marriage work, really.
R:  Right.
L:  So -- so you've been with your boyfriend how many years?
R:  Um, four years.
L:  Four years?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And how old are you?
R:  I'm twenty.
L:  Twenty.  Wow!  So, since high school then?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.  I -- one of the guys from my office, uh, [MN] been married to his wife since --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- he -- they gr- -- they -- they went to high school together, they met when they were freshmen and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they've been married -- he's thirty seven now, so it -- occasionally --
R:  Wh- --
L:  -- it works. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] A long time.
L:  So, do -- do you have any other rule?
R:  Um, [NOISE] well, I guess you can kind of say that -- it -- it's funny 'cause, um, like how you said that you -- you and your, um, girlfriend don't even joke about breaking up or whatever, like, me and my --
L:  Right.
R:  -- boyfriend, we don't even joke about, like, you know how, like, some people will be, like, "Oh, oh, you're such a bitch" or -- to their wife --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or something like that or --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, or "You're -- you're acting real bitchy right now" it's just like little comments like that, I'm like --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- we don't even joke about stuff like that, 'cause, I know, I'm, like, "Okay" once you start to even joke about, like, some, you know, amount of the lack of respect, that's kind of like, "Okay, how far is it really going to go?" like, "Are you really going to start calling me a bitch?" or --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- you know, how far is it really going to go?  So --
L:  I --
R:  -- I think that we h- have, like, some unspoken rules about -- just, like, how we perceive respect [NOISE] and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like, just h- -- where the limits are, like, I know not to go this place and you know not to go that place or whatever.
L:  Right.  What about, I mean, money, 'cause I know, I mean, personally, you know, I did -- I -- I certainly didn't pick my life partner based on what I thought she was going to bring in incomewise --
R:  Right, okay.
L:  -- eh, um, did, I mean, do you, I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- do you h- -- think that that's important in the long run?
R:  Money?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, [LAUGH] I think it can cause --
