R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.  Hello.
R:  Hi, I'm Becky.
L:  I'm Leonard.  How are you doing today?
R:  Um, good.  How are you?
L:  Oh, pretty good.  Um, uh, I was just curious, how -- how did you find ab- -- out about this program?
R:  Oh, I got an email.
L:  Ah.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I heard about it from a friend that -- they -- they also, um, kinda filled me in.
R:  Mhm.  Um, I -- I think it's just someone, um, you know, that was circulating it around my school.
L:  Ah.  
R:  Yeah.  So, what's your favorite sport to watch on TV?
L:  Well, I don't really have a favorite sport.  I -- I don't watch much in the way of sports.  Um, I do on occasion, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- watch different ones ju- -- if it happens to be on.
R:  Mhm.  I must say, um, I don't really set out to watch sports on TV.  Um, if I do, maybe it's during the Olympics.  Or something that's, um, special, you know, like, a competition or something.
L:  Oh, well, um, I kinda like different, uh, different sports to -- just to, uh, i- -- if they're on.  I've seen, um, i- s- -- violent ones, you know, um, like wrestling.  I -- I like that on +occasions.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  But not too often.  It's just too much violence.
R:  [LAUGH] Do you like mostly team sports?  Or individual sports like tennis?
L:  Tennis is okay.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, golf is okay.  Um, uh, I like miniature golf.  I like playing it anyway.  [NOISE] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  It can be fun.
R:  Usually I don't really enjoy watching sports on TV much.  They're, um, really -- 'cause I, like, enjoy watching gymnastics during the Olympics --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- because --
L:  -- that is kind of enjoyable.
R:  -- yeah, 'cause it's really impressive to see, uh, the athletes do that.  But things like [inaudible] ball and basketball, those really don't interest me much.
L:  I've watched ice skating.  That's --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- that's -- I -- I, like, kinda ice skating.  I -- it's -- it's interesting watching them do a lot of the different, uh, to get more acrobatic, [MN] [inaudible] --
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that and the, uh, [PAUSE] i- -- it's really getting dangerous in school where -- where you see the, uh, inbetween time the -- or, uh, what do they call 'em?  You know, the cheerleaders --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they're getting really some dangerous stunts out there.
R:   Hm.  Mhm.  Yeah, cheering +competit- -- competitions are kind of interesting to watch too.
L:  Uh, what kind of competitions.
R:  Cheering competitions.  When they break out all the --
L:  Oh, cheerle- -- yeah.  Uh-huh.
R:  -- yeah.  'Cause they do a lot of gymnastics moves in there too.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  There -- there's, um, there's a lot o- -- and it takes a lot of skill, shh.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Otherwise you break your neck.
R:  [LAUGH] Um, I enjoy watching -- mostly I enjoy watching the sports that I, um, play and participate in too, like, tennis is kind of interesting to watch.  And I tried to watch snow boarding a little during the winter Olympics.  What about you?
L:  Oh, I -- I di- -- it's -- I more like be involved in a sport than watch it.  [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, if it's -- it seems to be a little bit more interesting if you're involved in it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, like, uh, occasionally, uh, something like baseball, um, I've seen some of the -- i- i- -- they- they've come up with some good interesting movies in baseball, you know, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I like that movie, Angel --  [NOISE] not, Angel in the Outfield, but, uh, I can't think of what the name of it is, but if -- if you -- if you build it they will come.  [MN]
R:  Oh --
L:  Field of Dreams.
R:  Okay.  Did you see the most recent one about baseball that came out?  I think it was called The Rookie.
L:  Uh, what was it?
R:  The Rookie.
L:  Rookie?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I've seen one called, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know that it was called The Rookie.  It was called, uh, but, uh, d- d- the +name does sound familiar, The Rookie.  Uh, what was that one about?
R:  Um, I think [MN] --
L:  I was going to say, have you seen it?
R:  I have seen it, but I remember it was interesting [LAUGH] but, um, this man, he goes back to baseball after I think several decades and he, I don't know, he goes back to baseball, that's all I remember.  I think it was Kevin Costner. 
L:  I -- I d- -- I remember one, uh, where, uh, light- lightening hit a tree and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he made a bat out of a -- out of a, um, out of -- out of the tree.
R:  That sounds vaguely familiar.  E- -- 
L:  Yeah, it was, ah, it was very impressive and, um, ah, [MN] they checked the bat, you know, and -- and made sure it was legal and let him play with it.  And --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it seems to me that m- -- I can't think of what the name of that was.  But it was a good movie.  It was, um, I -- I can't think of who -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- who played in it either.
R:  Uh-huh.  What about football?  Do you watch, um, maybe sport, like, school football on TV?
L:  Oh, if -- if it happens to be, uh, nothing else on, [LAUGH] --
R:  Do you have any favorite team?
L:  -- yeah I'd watch it but -- if there's something else more interesting on, I'd probably watch something more interesting.
R:  Mhm.  I just recently started watching college football this year but that's only --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- when my school is playing someone.  I'm not really interested in any other schools.
L:  Un, what, uh, um, what kind of -- what kind of um, school -- other school sports do you go in for?
R:  Um, [PAUSE] let me think.  Um, we have a really +good tae kwon do team I think and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that -- that's always interesting to watch.
L:  Yeah, that does sound kinda interesting.  It' s o- -- it is kinda interesting to watch the, uh, um, the different sport, uh, th- th- that has become a sport now is the tae kwon do and the judo and the kung -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- whatever, you know.  [MN] Karate and a- -- that has become more of a -- more of a sport.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I never even thought about that one when you -- when they --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- talked about sports.
R:  Yeah.  I think that they just introduced them kind of, um, martial arts in the Olympic -- I'm not sure.
L:  I don't know if they've intro- introduced it into the Olympics or not. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  I know they've, uh, but they are classifying it more as a sport.
R:  Mhm.  [several inaudible words] Um, let's see that's too bad that neither of us really watches TV on sport.
L:  Oh, I don't know.  E- everybody has their own -- own -- own -- own deal about sports and not everybody's going to like sports.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, in a way it's nice to get, uh, get to talk to somebody, [MN] not necessarily that likes sports if you don't like sports.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um, it's not that I don't like sports, it's just that they don't n- -- specifically interest me.  [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.  I do feel that I'd rather be participating in them than watching them.
L:  Yeah.  That's -- that's what seems to be a lot f- -- uh, more fun.  I like --
R:  I don't --
L:  -- volleyball.
R:  -- yeah.  I'm not really the type of person to get attached to a team just because they're from my hometown or something either.
L:  Yeah.  I agree with you there because, um, sometimes it -- uh, even thought you should support your own hometown team, you may not have a good one.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  One worth supporting.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Course, if you didn't support 'em, maybe nobody else will.
R:  Mhm.  [PAUSE] Do you play a lot of sports?
L:  What was that?
R:  Do you play a lot of sports?
L:  Oh, I haven't in a while.  I -- I've been too busy doing other things.  Um, I, uh, not had much lately to do with sports.  Ah, oh, I don't know that you'd call horseshoes sports, but I play horseshoes.
R:  Mhm.  Mm.
L:  And I've, uh, got a chance to do a lot of that.  
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  I do that more -- more often because it's, uh, uh, actually it's -- it only -- it don't require much in the way of people --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, uh, and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you can set that up anywhere.
R:  Yeah, it's kind of hard to play sports when you don't have anyone to play with.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah, that's -- that does get kind of difficult.
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  Uh, what was the, um, uh, last kind of sports you was into?
R:  Um, I think it was tennis.  I played the --
L:  Did you --
R:  I played doubles.
L:  -- di- did you hurt your -- [MN] h- how does the back -- how is your back --
