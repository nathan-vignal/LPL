L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Tania.
R:  Hi, Tania, I'm Billy.
L:  Hi, Billy [SIGH] --
R:  How're you doing?
L:  Where are you at?
R:  I'm in Dallas.
L:  Okay, I'm in --
R:  What about yourself?
L:  -- North Carolina.
R:  North Carolina?
L:  Yes.
R:  Uh-oh, great.
L:  Yes.  Is this your first call or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- have you done this before? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, th- this is my first call, I was just, uh --
L:  This is my first one too. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, um --
R:  Okay, well I guess, we'll have to kind of work our way through --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- this and --
L:  Okay, sounds good.  Um, we're supposed to talk about life partners, I guess, what you're looking for?
R:  Yes.
L:  Um --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I'm married, so --
R:  You're married, how -- how long have you been married?
L:  Um, almost eight years. [MN]
R:  Eight years?
L:  Almost, yeah, it'll be November --
R:  Oh, great.
L:  -- it'll be eight years.  What about you?
R:  I'm single.
L:  Single?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, you know, sometimes that's fun too. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] It -- it gets fun to a point, I guess.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What do you, uh -- what do you, uh, like most about being married for eight years?
L:  Um, I just -- I like having somebody to do things with, pretty much, you know, it's a given.  If I want to go do something, I have somebody to go do it with.  Um, you know, although my husband and I sort of like different things sometimes.  He likes different kinds of movies than I do and things like that, so [SIGH] sometimes we have to find friends to go to things with --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- what -- with too, but, uh --
R:  Well, you got to --
L:  -- I love that.
R:  -- yeah, you got to get away everybody for a while, though.
L:  Y- yeah, but I like having, like I said, somebody to do things with and somebody to share things with, if you've had a good day or a bad day, you know, you know that there's somebody you can talk to about it. [LIPSMACK] So -- what -- when you're, like, going out with somebody, what are you looking for?
R:  [SIGH] Well, now, I k- -- I kind of look -- [MN] make sure they're easy to talk to and, I guess, they've -- have a good personality, a fun personality and stuff like that. [SIGH] Just, uh, I don't know, it's just really easy to talk to, I guess --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is mainly what I'm looking for.
L:  Sense of humor.
R:  Sense of humor and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I guess, I -- I don't know, you can tell a lot bout -- a lot about people that way, I think.
L:  I -- no, I would agree with you, um, I think that the way people handle situations, I think, says a lot about them.
R:  Yeah, don't -- don't get me wrong, I -- I personally kind of think, like, the first couple of minutes, it's pure attraction, and then --
L:  Well, sure.
R:  -- from there it's just, uh -- you're m- more on the personality and stuff like that -- what they like and, you know, dislike and stuff like that.
L:  Right.  And I think it's -- it's good to like things the same but it's good to sort of have different interests too.  Like I --
R:  Yes, it --
L:  -- was saying, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- my husband and I have different things --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- he likes certain kinds of things --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I like certain kinds of things --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and, [SIGH] you know, over our marriage there's been things that he's sort of said, "Well, what about this" and then I end up really liking it, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when -- and for example, like, I love to cook and I make all kinds of funky things, [LAUGH] you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I love to watch Emerald, and, um, you know, he'd never tried a lot of things until we got married and now he -- he tries all kinds of different things.
R:  Yeah, I think there's got to be a little -- little leveling of having -- to be able to try new things and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I -- I guess, and understanding of each other.
L:  So, where do you go to meet people in, uh --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- Texas there?
R:  Well, I kind of -- I kind of go wherever, you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I think there's opportunities to meet people, you know, at restaurants or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or bars and, um, church and stuff like that.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  So, I just kind of -- it kind of depends on what -- what you're looking for, who you're with and I think mainly most of the people I've really kind of started going out with or whatever, has been through friends of friends.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, just going out with your own buddies and then they have friends and some place down the line you kind of meet up with some people that you find interesting.
L:  [SIGH] I think that's good because then you kind of -- there's somebody there to sort of, um, like, vouch for them --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like, "Hey, this person's not completely, you know, wacko" -- [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or whatever.  Um, that's how I met my husband, was friends of friends.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  He actually -- he had actually gone out on, like, two dates with one of my girlfriends and it just --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- didn't -- th- they just didn't hit it off, didn't work out and -- but it was okay, you know, like I said, they only went out, like, twice.
R:  Well, it worked out good for you then.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It did, it did.  Um, and she was totally cool with it, she was, like, "Oh, I'm so glad you guys have hit it off" and, you know -- [MN] she was in our wedding and everything, so that was fine, but I think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, friends of friends is good.  Like I said, that way that you -- you sort of know a little bit about the person.
R:  Yeah, you could find out, I guess, the things that you kind of always wanted to know, uh -- always ask new people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but you never know if you're getting the h- -- the real answer or not --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you can kind of find out through your friends of what they're really like.
L:  Right.  In this day and age sometimes you never know if somebody's telling you the truth or not --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- unless you do know somebody who knows them, you, uh, see things on the news, you know, "This guy was married to five different women and none of them knew about it" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, [LAUGH] so as at least if you know one of their friends they can say, "Yeah, they not really telling you the truth" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- or, "They are telling you the truth" or whatever.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I think there's got to be a -- a level, like a certain trust level with whatever you're doing.  Like, especially in marriage, but, like, in even in dating or anything like that, or even friendship --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there's just gotta be that trust -- trust level that makes everything work.
L:  Yeah, I don't know, you know, if you met somebody and you found out they were lying to you about something right away, that would sort of put a -- a pall on the whole thing.
R:  Yeah, unfortunately it -- it kind of -- kind of ruins everything.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, [NOISE] so --
R:  I used to date someone who had problems with lying so [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, no. [NOISE]
R:  -- I r- -- I really kinda look after that, you know, I really think that that's mainly one of the top, like, five things I look for in somebody.
L:  Somebody who's really honest?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or at least, straightforward, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  'Cause people I won't -- tell you stuff even though you -- you don't want to hear it, they'll just come out and say it and, [MN] I guess, not blunt -- bluntly, but they'll at least let you know, even if it's might the worst thing --
L:  In a tactful way.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right, yeah, but then again --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you don't want somebody who's going to tell --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you everything right away --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- I don't know if you've ever met somebody and in the first, you know, ten minutes of talking to them they've told you about, [SIGH] you know, their horrible childhood and how this happened to them and that happened to them and you're sort of going, "Okay, when I said, 'How are you?' --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] "-- I just sort of meant, you know, I'm good, thanks"
R:  "Don't want to know that much about you anymore".
L:  Exactly. [LAUGH] So, I think, it's sort of important to have that -- sort of be in the middle.  Like, be honest and be open, but you don't have to tell everything right away.
R:  Oh, yeah, there's got to be a certain [MN] mystery about everybody, of why people act the way they do and stuff like that --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and there's certain things you can only feel comfortable telling s- -- people that you really like or whatever.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  So, you got, uh -- you and your husband have kids and all that, or ...?
L:  Just one.
R:  Just one?
L:  He's, um -- he's getting ready to be a year old.  Uh, actually this Sunday.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, so, we're -- we're planning for the big party on Sunday.
R:  [LAUGH] What are you all going to do?
L:  Oh, just family members and some friends.
R:  Oh.
L:  Trying to keep it sort of small, but that -- that's hard --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because most of our families, uh, both live in this area --
R:  Oh, do they?
L:  -- so, yeah.
R:  How do you like that?  Is that pretty --
L:  Yeah, it's nice most of the time, you know, built in -- we have built in, uh, sort of babysitters that you can trust --
R:  Yeah, that's good.
L:  -- and that you know, you know.
R:  Well, you can still get out and do things.
L:  Right, right. [SIGH] And, um, you know -- [NOISE] what about you, [MN] I mean, do you want to -- to get married, have kids, that whole thing, or --
R:  Yeah, tha- --
L:  -- are you pretty happy the way you are?
R:  -- yeah, eventually I do, you know, there's a certain time.  I just -- I graduated, uh, school, uh, Texas Tech University and I've just wanted to kind of get established in what --
L:  Oh, okay [NOISE].
R:  -- my job for -- I guess --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is what you'd say.  And, I'm kind of starting to get where I want to be and paid off some debt and all that, so now I'm kind of looking around and more open to relationships now and stuff --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like that.
L:  Yeah, it's kind of hard to have a relationship in college.
R:  Oh, yeah, 'cause you never know what you're going to do after two years --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like, [MN] so --
L:  That and I found when I was in college, [LAUGH] you know, it was so -- it would be hard to become a date with somebody because your friends would be like, "Hey, we're going to go out and do this" you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and then you're --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you're -- well, in my case, you know, boyfriends --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- would say, "Well, gosh, I thought we were going to go do something". [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, like, "But my friends want to go to this party", so --
R:  That's one thing I think's changed over -- over time, is that it's more acceptable just to go out in big groups and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- all that kind of st- -- instead of having to go on date dates --
L:  Right.
R:  -- which, uh, I'm okay with both of them, but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's just kind of one of those things that's kind of changed over time, I guess.
L:  [MN] Probably, I don't --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- I haven't -- like I said, I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- haven't been in the dating situation for so long, I probably wouldn't even know what to do.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I -- I just feel like, "Um, so, you know, what are we going to dinner, what -- what's going on?" you know, 'cause it's just sort of like, I'll go to my husband, like, "Yeah, you wanna go eat, or something?" [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, it's -- it's not a big deal. [NOISE] So, it's not like you have to really [SIGH] pl- -- you know, plan everything and -- and, like -- you probably, if you're going go out with somebody, you're probably, like, trying to plan what you want to do and where you want to go --
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, it -- it's a lot of work kind of goes into it that -- I know it always seems to change right as you s- -- you know, go pick 'em up or whatever.  They don't like the restaurant or s- -- they don't like that kin- kind of food or something like that.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh.
R:  So you got to think on -- think real quick and come up with something different.
L:  Well, there's probably a lot of nice restaurants down there though.
R:  [MN] Yeah, it's usually pretty close around. [NOISE] So, uh, do you meet, like --
L:  You live in a bigger city than I do.
R:  What kind of city -- city do you live in?
L:  Um, it's sort of -- well, I guess, it's medium size, I mean, it's --
