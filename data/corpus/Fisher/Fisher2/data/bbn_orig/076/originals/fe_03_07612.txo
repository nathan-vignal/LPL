L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I'm not really much into basketball on TV.  I have a hard time following it.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE] 
R:  It seems so -- to me so fast.
L:  Uh-huh.  Well, baseball is, um, kind of one of the more, um, you know, that I don't get into too much watching on TV.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Because it, you know, it moves kinda slow.
R:  That's true.  I like to watch, like, when there's, um, um, in the winter I like to watch the -- the, um, sk- -- down he- hill skiing and the -- and the slaloms and I like to watch, um, the winter Olympic kinds of sport.

R:  -- periodically or golf.
L:  Oh, yeah, that's the one thing I couldn't -- I couldn't sit and watch was a -- an auto race.
R:  I [inaudible] it's -- they're pretty boring.
L:  They are pretty boring. 
R:  'Specially when they going around and around and around.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yep.  Um, I watch boxing as well.
R:  Oh, boxing would --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- probably be pretty good on -- on TV.
L:  Yeah, whenever there's boxing matches on, I tend to watch 'em.
R:  Yeah, I've seen a few of those on the pay per view when I go over to a friend's house.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  When there's -- there's, um, a big fight on.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that's -- that's a lot of fun especially if -- if you have a lot of people around.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, to watch it with you.
L:  Yeah.  You make a --
R:  I typically don't watch by myself.  I usually watch when --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- there' someone else around,
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  [MN] what about soccer?  Do you watch soccer?
R:  Not much.
L:  No.
R:  Um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- never -- I don- -- I don't know the rules of soccer,
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um --
L:  Yeah, I -- I don't really much get into soccer either.  Um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and golf, I usually just [LAUGH] watch golf to see, Tiger Woods, play.
R:  Yeah [inaudible] you know, I watch, like, the highlights of  --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- of a -- a golf tournament.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, gee, what else -- what other kind of sports have I watched?
L:  And hockey.
R:  I love hockey in person, but I'm -- hockey -- ice hockey and -- and on TV's okay --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um --
L:  Yeah, I -- I prefer it in person too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Far more interesting in person.
R:  Well, yeah.  Well, partly 'cause it goes so fast.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  And it's -- it's hard to -- to watch on the screen.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  Um, let's see, what else, what other sports.  Oh, I watch the horse races, I watch the Kentucky Derby and the --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- the Preakness and the -- the --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- Triple Crown races.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll tell you one thing that I've been watching lately is these extreme sports.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Like the -- the bicyclists and the skate boarders.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH] They do some wild things.  And these [MN] --  
R:  That's -- that's true.  Those are real interesting 'cause --
L:  Yeah.  The motorcycle riders -- 
R:  -- you -- I sit down and I go, "I can't believe that". 
L:  Uh-huh.  The motorcycle guys that do tricks --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- on the motorcycle.  They come off them and sit on the handlebars and stretch their legs out and [LAUGH] --
R:  You bet.
L:  -- like, most people can't do that when the bike's not moving and these --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- guys are doing it forty -- forty feet up in the air.
R:  I know.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's amazing.
L:  Uh-huh   Yeah.
R:  Um, what other kind of sports are on television?
L:  Uh, well, now with cable you can get just about anything.
R:  That's true, mm.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, I get -- I did watch some of the US Open.
L:  Did you?
R:  Was that the US Open?  No.  That -- that's golf.  Um --
L:  The French Open.
R:  -- the tennis match -- the tennis match that they just had -- the French Open?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Was that the French Open?  
L:  I think --
R:  I watched some of the highlights from that.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  And I -- I k- kind like to watch the -- the big games -- big te- -- part of the big en- -- tennis games.  It's -- at least --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- like the last --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the last set.
L:  Mhm.  Well, I watched, um, I watched that because I live in Vegas and, um, Andre Agassi, lives here.
R:  Ooh.
L:  That's why I watched his match.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.  So, that was pretty interesting.  He was -- he looked like he was tired out.
R:  Yeah.  He didn't do too well.
L:  No.
R:  None of the Americans did real well this -- this time.
L:  No.  He -- he lost in the -- in the semis.
R:  Did he?
L:  Or maybe even before the semis.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But yeah, they're -- the younger kid he was playing just looked so -- so much more full of energy than, Andre, did.
R:  Yeah.  Well, how old is getting to be now?
L:  Oh, Andre Agassi's, got to be in his mid thirties now.
R:  Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Well, how old is getting to be now?
L:  Oh, Andre Agassi's, got to be in his mid thirties now.
R:  Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, is that kind of, like, past the prime for tennis?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  From the -- the no -- the -- the real strong players these days are all younger?
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just like everything else, you know.  When all these other sports, once you hit to mid thirties, you know, it's -- it's time for you to think about retirement.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, like basketball.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  You got the San Antonio just won the championship and, David Robertson's[?], retiring.
R:  How old is he?
L:  Uh, he's thirty seven, thirty eight.
R:  Yeah, he's getting up there then.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, you know, you've got these new young players coming up, you know, Tim Duncan, [PAUSE] you know, Kobe Bryant[?], Shaquille, with the Lakers --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I feel -- I w- -- I feel real sorry for --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- for the young, um, players who end up, um, getting hurt --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then -- and then not able to finish their professional careers.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I feel sorry for 'em when they haven't gotten an education to --
L:  Well, yeah --
R:  -- or something to fall back on.
L:  -- that's true because a lot of 'em, like, this -- this, um, young kid that just came out of high school for basketball, uh, Brian James[?].
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  They drafted him straight out of high school.
R:  I know, I saw that.
L:  You know, if -- if anything happens to him his first couple of years in the league, he has a high school education, that's it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, 'cause he passed up college to -- to become a professional athlete.
R:  Yeah, and chances are he doesn't have -- well, hopefully he's got somebody watching his money.  But --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- chances are, h- -- don- -- it'll be blown.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  That young they don't ever see -- they don't usually have a -- a sense of tomorrow.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Meaning to save for tomorrow,
L:  Not at -- not at eighteen.  [LAUGH] 
R:  No.  
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] No, not at eighteen years old.
R:  No.  It's, like, "Oh, I need fast cars, I need", you know.
L:  Uh, I need a big house.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And lots of toys.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You bet.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE] 
R:  Um, gee, what else.  [SIGH] What other kind of sports do you watch?
L:  Uh, on TV, that s -- that's --
R:  What?
L:  -- pretty much it.
R:  On TV?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's pretty much it.  [NOISE] Baseball, I tend to -- I tend to watch baseball more when the playoffs start.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, because like I said, baseball's kind of -- kinda boring, even thought that's the sport I played in college.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's -- it's a lot more fun to play it, than watch it on TV.
R:  Oh, you bet.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You bet.  When I lived in Los Angeles, um, I used to go to Dodger games a lot --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I find myself watching some of the Dodger games when I was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- going to -- when I was going to games a lot.  When I knew the players and -- and stuff.
L:  Mhm.  Right.  Well, see I grew --
R:  But, yeah, I'm like you for mo- -- for the most part it's the -- the playoffs that I -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that I like to watch.
L:  Mhm.  Well, I grew up in, um, New Mexico --
R:  Oh, that's where I am.
L:  -- so, we didn't have a professional team.
R:  Yes.  What part of New Mexico?
L:  Um, right outside of Albuquerque.
R:  Uh, I lived in Albuquerque for a while.  Right now I live in Farmington.
L:  Oh, do you?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I grew up in Bernalillo.
R:  Oh, I know where that is.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, no professional teams there so, it was hard to, uh, go see a professional game of any kind.
R:  That's true.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I was lu-- I was lucky in Los Angeles 'cause I -- it was what -- I could go see the Kings or --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- or I could go see -- I never went to Laker games but I could go see the Dodgers.  They -- I went to the Dodgers a lot and --
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  -- the Kings games a lot.
L:  Yeah.  And did you watch football as well?
R:  Um, yeah, some.  Um, I went to a couple of pro games --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- not a lot.  [PAUSE] When I went to football it was -- it was more when I was in college.
L:  Uh-huh.  Right.  Right.  The college games?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, [inaudible] --
R:  You -- 
L:  -- I can't -- I can't get into college football on TV --
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  -- for -- for some reason it just, you know, I'll watch pro football every weekend --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- when it's on.  But college football, it just -- just doesn't seem to interest me, for whatever reason.
R:  Do you like the -- the bowl games?
L:  Not even really the bowl games.
R:  Hm.
L:  I don't even really watch those, unless -- unless like you said, it's a whole group of people getting together for a barbeque or something.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, and it just happens to be on, or that's the reason why everybody's together, then, you know, then I'll watch it.  But I don't -- I don't really follow college at all.
R:  Yeah.  Probably from my [several inaudible words] was -- was playing but --
