R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, my name is Denise.  Who are you?
L:  This is David.
R:  Have you ever done one of these before?
L:  Um, I actually have done two before.
R:  Okay.  I -- I think I've done two before too but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it's been a while since I've done one.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, we're supposed to talk about --
R:  [NOISE] Excuse me?
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I have some little ones. [LAUGH]
L:  So do we over here too. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] How old are your kids?
L:  Um ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  ... uh, uh, ten --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- eight and, uh, ten months.
R:  [NOISE] Ah, well, I have a two year old and a four month old. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  So, yeah, and the two year old's right now, like, driving me nuts. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] But anyway, I guess the topic is pets.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Which --
L:  Do you have pets?
R:  Yes, I do.
L:  What do you have?
R:  I have two cats and a dog.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, and I'm currently fostering kittens for the local Humane League.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yes.  So --
L:  You have a lot.
R:  So -- and I have four kittens.  And I used to have a horse, but I no longer have the horse because once my first daughter came along, I decided not to work, and financially couldn't afford it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But -- do you have pets?
L:  Um, we have a dog and then, uh, we have kind of a strange situation out here where, um, we live kind of out in the country and there -- there are some, I don't know, abandoned cats or wild cats or something like that that always hang around our house, so --
R:  Okay.
L:  They're kind of like our pets too, I guess. [LAUGH]
R:  Where do you live?
L:  In, um, in Dulzura.  It's a kind of a small town not far from San Diego.
R:  Okay.  Oh, wow.
L:  What about you?
R:  Um, Pennsylvania.  Uh, do you know where -- like, Lancaster County, Amish country.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, I'm -- I'm in that area.  So --
L:  You live in Am- -- are you Amish?
R:  No, no, no.  If I were Amish I wouldn't be talking to you right now. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that's right, they can't use phones.  Don't push. [LAUGH]
R:  No, no, I'm not Amish.
L:  Oh.
R:  But, um ... but, yeah, I -- I, uh, that's one topic I love talking about; it's one reason I decided to accept it today 'cause I -- I love talking about my animals [NOISE] and stuff like that but [NOISE] --
L:  So, what --
R:  What kind of -- what kind of dog do you have?
L:  Uh, a black lab.
R:  Okay.
L:  About four years old.
R:  Yeah, my --
L:  What about --
R:  Oh, go on.
L:  What about you?  What about you?
R:  Um, my dog, well, she's -- she's a mutt.  Um, she is classified I -- I got from the Humane League she is classified as, like, a Newfoundland mix.
L:  Right.
R:  And she's about a year and a half old but she's just -- so she's pretty much full grown.  She's only about the size of a border collie.  Actually kind of looks like a border collie.  But, um, s- she kind of has, like, a lab face, so who knows what she's mixed with.  She's nowhere close to the size of a Newfoundland though.
L:  But she -- she -- she doesn't mind all the cats around?
R:  No, she loves them.
L:  Wow.
R:  It's -- it's funny -- well, sh- -- my cats don't like her because, you know, they're cats.  The kittens are, like, very interested in her.
L:  Right.
R:  But she has a tendency to, like, go over and try to pick them up.
L:  Oh.
R:  And -- which -- she's very gentle about it.
L:  Right.
R:  But she gets kind of annoying about it too because she wants to play and she plays with some of the local dogs and gets a little bit rough with the kittens at times, which --
L:  Yeah.
R:  She's not hurting them but it's like -- I need to break her away from them.
L:  Right.
R:  But yeah, it's r- -- it's pretty interesting but, um ...
L:  Well, you've got your hands full over there.
R:  I do.  I do.
L:  Wow.
R:  But the kittens, actually ... bu- -- with the way this program works at our Humane League, um [LIPSMACK] the kittens are too young to be adopted so they find foster families for them instead of putting them down.  And you take them in until they're adoptable.  Well, I actually have mine a little bit longer 'cause they're having some problems with some parasites and we're trying to get that cleared up before we put them up for adoption.
L:  Right.
R:  But, um, it's fun having them because you get them at -- at the, like, kitten stage.
L:  Right.
R:  And then you get rid of 'em before they become cats. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  What happens if they can't find homes for 'em?  Do you just have to keep them?
R:  Ah, well, ac- -- they have cages at the Humane League --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and they do have places to put them, although right now they're very full.  There's, like ... they have so many kittens in there right now.
L:  It's so sad when you go to the Humane and you see all those -- all those pets.  You just wanna take 'em all home.
R:  It is sad, because right now is a very difficult time.  Like, last Friday I was in -- um, 'cause I had to bring a stool sa- -- no, it was Saturday.  I had to bring a stool sample in for them to check for the parasites to see if they, um, had, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- th- -- had -- they were no longer there, type of thing and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- anyway, um [NOISE] just that day before they -- they -- seventy cats were brought into the shelter.
L:  Wow.
R:  And -- you know, and --
L:  In -- in one day?
R:  In one day.
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  One day.  This is a terrible time of season.  If you would look in their kitten -- their kitten rooms are full, their -- they actually have kittens in the main area where they normally only have adult cats.  And unfortunately, you know, they do have to euthanize some of the animals --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because they just don't have the room for them.  And right now this is the most they've ever had out in foster care.  They have over a hundred and fifty animals out in foster care.
L:  Wow.
R:  Which is a lot of animals.  But, you see, uh, most of those are cats.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, ninety nine percent of those are cats.  Occasionally they'll foster out dogs but i- it's more so the cats.
L:  How come this time of year's such a big -- big thing for cats?
R:  Well [SIGH] over the winter y- -- they typically aren't -- the cats really aren't out and about.
L:  Right.
R:  And, you know, come the spring, they really, you know, there's a lot more cats out there and people are finding the kittens.  It's m- --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- main- -- I mean, there's kittens all year long, but the spring's when you get hit with them really hard.  A- --
L:  You guys have snow and stuff out there?
R:  Yes, we do.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yes, we do.  Actually, one, um ... right after my baby was born, the weekend after my baby was born, um, we had a huge snow storm of, like, twenty four inches or something like that. [LAUGH]
L:  Jeeze.
R:  Yes, I was lucky, I just got home, like, a day or two before that snow hit so I -- I felt pretty lucky about that.
L:  Yeah, no kidding.
R:  Yeah.  But, um, but there's a downside to fostering kittens.  My sister just had a foster litter.  This is only my second foster litter.  And my sister just had -- like, she's on her seventh or eighth foster litter.
L:  Right.
R:  But she actually -- her -- she had three of them and they all died.
L:  Oh, no.  You mean they died while they were with her?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, how sad.
R:  Yeah, she actually -- on this past Sunday was trying to bring them back to the Humane league because she, um, knew that they were not doing good and she was basically bringing them back there to be euthanized.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But she -- they -- she said by the time she got there they are -- had already died.  They were that bad.
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, so ... so, yeah, I mean, there's this downside.
L:  Uh.
R:  I've been lucky so far 'cause all of mine have been okay.  You know, they've been sick a little bit.  I -- when I got these kittens, um, two of them had major eye problems.
L:  Right.
R:  That -- they were almost thinking of euthanizing them, versus letting me take them and try to save them, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  B- but their eyes got better.  They don't look normal but, you know, they definitely -- they're pretty much normal kittens.  Can do everything the ones with the good eyes can.  But --
L:  Is -- is that -- is that normal procedure, to send out the sick ones too, to people?
R:  Yeah, they -- they do try to sa- -- they try to save as many as they can.  Um, and, you know, they thought that -- they weren't sure if there were eyeballs underneath their eyes 'cause they were that swollen and ... and, you know, gumpy looking and -- and they, um, definitely try to save as many as they can.  But when I got this litter, there weren't nearly the amount of kittens there are now.  And it -- honestly, if these kittens were brought to the -- in to the Humane League right now, the -- the two of them probably definitely would have been euthanized, just --
L:  Because they have so many, yeah.
R:  They have so many.  They don't have enough foster families.
L:  Right.
R:  And, you know, it gets into that bind.  But yeah, I mean, I -- I love animals and this is the way, you know, I -- i- it's a lot.  And 'cause my cats are pretty much -- they're upstairs cats and my dog's a downstairs dog.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, right.
R:  They're upstairs because of the dog, basically.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah, they don't wanna be bothered by him.  My cats are older, they're, like, nine and seven and ... you know, they're just, like -- they're content just lounging around. [LAUGH]
L:  You've had them since they were kittens?
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah, the one I got when I was, um, in college.  And, uh, the other one I -- it was a barn cat where I brought up my one horse -- well, I only had one horse. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  And, um ... [LIPSMACK] yeah, so it was ... it, uh, I love my cats.  I used to hate cats though.  Um, there were some neighborhood cats that would, uh, eat the baby animals and I didn't care for that when I was younger but --
L:  Yeah, that would give you a bad impression.
R:  Oh, definitely, definitely.
L:  So you guys have a big enough property to have a horse out there, huh?
R:  Uh, well, I actually boarded her when I had her.
L:  Oh.
R:  And, um ... it -- like, it -- it was too expensive to board.
L:  Yeah, my friend has -- has a horse.  He says he -- he didn't know what he was getting into ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  ... with all the expenses [LAUGH] in it.
R:  They're not cheap.
L:  No.
R:  They're not cheap.  It'd definitely be cheaper if I could have her on my own property but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- we live in a development and we only have about a third of an acre.  So it's not like we have a lot of land and -- and to buy land just for that, it just wasn't feasible with having kids, 'cause I just knew I wouldn't be able to devote the time to her.
L:  Right.
R:  And I loved her to death but, you know, I g- -- [MN] my friend, we went in halves so we could split the time going to see her, and so, um, I gave her to her after --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- after I decided to back out of the financial end.  And I can go see her pretty much any time but it's getting to the point where she is getting married in -- in the fall and -- and she's going to be needing a new car and everything too, so she's actually looking for a home for her now.
L:  She's going to s- -- probably sell the horse [inaudible]?
R:  Yeah, yeah, so --
L:  Huh.
R:  It's kind of sad because we both were like, "We're not going to get rid of her till she dies".  'Cause she was, like, twenty two years old and [SIGH] and, uh, you know, we didn't want to get rid of her till she died.  But, you know, unfortunately things change in our life and ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  ... and you have to make sacrifices somewhere and so it's -- you know, it was -- it's a tough decision to make but you gotta do what's best for her too.
L:  Mm.
R:  'Cause if you can't afford her then, you know, it's not --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- good -- good for her.
L:  Yeah, especially if you're just keeping her and you can't even see her.  She's just, like, being a prisoner, practically.
R:  Definitely.
L:  Better --
R:  Um, the only thing with a boarding stable is they do turn them out during the day and everything but --
L:  Well, that's --
R:  -- you know, she wouldn't get any attention or anything and she loves att-
