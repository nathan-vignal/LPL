L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  Um --
R:  I'm Kathy.
L:  I'm Mindy.
R:  Hi, Mindy, how are you?
L:  Fine.  
R:  Where are you?
L:  Um, Georgia.
R:  Georgia?  Okay.  I'm in Nova Scotia, Canada.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.  I suppose pretty far afield.
L:  Yes, it is.  
R:  Yeah, okay.  Are you -- do you have pets?
L:  I do.  We have three cats, um that are -- well, one of our cats is always inside and the other two are indoor, outdoor.
R:  Okay.  
L:  But they're always in at night and we have a dog that stays outside and we have two birds that you might be able to hear [LAUGH].
R:  What kind of birds are they?
L:  Um, parakeets.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You are into pets.
L:  Well, the parakeets were given to us, coming out of Pets Mart, buying our pet food [LAUGH].
R:  Okay [LAUGH].
L:  Out of the -- the pet store and uh this lady walked up and her daughter was allergic to 'em, had gotten 'em for Christmas, so we've had 'em since January.
R:  Oh, that's kinda nice, though, isn't it?
L:  Yeah.  She gave us the cage and she gave us food.  We just recently had to buy more food and -- but I really like 'em.  I enjoy hearing 'em, uh --
R:  Yeah, I -- I -- my grandmother had birds.  I never -- we never had them.  We have -- we only have -- we have one cat.  We go through a series of one cat at a time 'cause they're all outdoor cats.
L:  Yes.
R:  We live in a rural area so they're -- they -- they have a mission in life.
L:  Right [LAUGH].
R:  And it is to protect us from all the little vermin.
L:  Right.
R:  And uh -- um, and you know what?  Being outdoors is hard on cats.  It -- it's um -- they all end up, uh, being on the side of the highway, Mindy, to tell you the truth.
L:  Right.  Oh, right.
R:  Which is -- which is part of what happens when you've got big logging trucks and stuff going by, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  But uh we spend um -- it's an outdoor at night cat and they uh -- they always, every -- every cat we've ever had has never, ever wanted to stay inside.  Um, just around midnight they start to yowl.  
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  And that's why -- how do you keep your cats inside?
L:  Um, they wanna come in at night.
R:  Really?
L:  They do.  They wanna come in and uh they come in during the day and get food and water and -- and we have one that comes in even to use the litter box [LAUGH].
R:  Wha- [LAUGH].
L:  She's so litter box trained that --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- she wants to come inside to use the litter box.  Um --
R:  We -- we tried to do that.  We try -- we -- there was one cat in particular that wasn't very big and we thought, well, maybe we'll keep her as an inside cat and she was neutered and the whole deal, very young, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we thought we were going to be fine and it started at midnight and went till three in the morning, for about four or five nights --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and my husband said, "Let that cat outside".
L:  Yeah.   I would, too [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Ours don't do that.  Now, sometimes they do, like, run around and you can hear 'em running into things --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but as far as um howling or meowing at night, we don't have a lot of problem with that.
R:  I'd -- and I thought, you know, I thought it was all tied in with neutering and I just thought if you did it young enough that they really wouldn't -- you know, it wouldn't be part of the pl- you know?
L:  Right.
R:  The operation, that they would need to get outside or anything like that, um, and apparently she needed to get outside.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  So it -- and -- and husbands are not sometimes as fond of cats as some other people in the family are [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  Is -- is your husband fond of animals?
L:  Well, I'm not married, but I live with my daughter and I live with my father, or I guess he -- we kinda live with each other.
R:  Okay.
L:  He has a home somewhere else, too, but he works up here where we live and so he stays with us, but um, he's not as fond of them.  Although occasionally we'll catch him talking to 'em in that little baby voice, you know?  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  Which they deny that they've done.  [LAUGH].
L:  Right.  Right.  "I did not".  [LAUGH].  Ah, he's got his cat --
R:  Does your dau- I'm sure is -- does your daughter help out with the animals?  I mean, how old is she?
L:  She's fifteen, and yeah, she's -- it's her job to feed and water and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- clean up any -- you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- hairballs or whatever, you know, any mess they make, it's her job to clean it up and uh she doesn't like it, but she wanted 'em.  And you know, they're really her pets and --
R:  Well, that's the thing, yeah.
L:  -- I mean, I love 'em.  I've fallen in love with them, you know, over the years but you know, they're her cats.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  We got 'em for her.
R:  And she's stuck to it?
L:  She's -- she's good.  She's taking -- she's done -- so far done really well.  You know, when she was smaller, we didn't -- no, she doesn't do the litter box.
R:  Okay.  
L:  But you know, I -- I don't really want her doing the -- [LAUGH].
R:  Well, that's kind of a tough one to get someone to do, too.
L:  I mean, she get -- she cleans it up if they -- if they mess or whatever, you know [LAUGH].  We have one that -- he was sick about two years ago and when we brought him home from the hospital, he wa- he -- if the litter box was not cleaned every day --
R:  Right.
L:  -- he'll go on the floor.
R:  Okay.  
L:  He --
R:  So he's particular?
L:  He is, and he wasn't before he went in there.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  And I don't know -- he -- he came back, I -- we -- we make a joke thing, instead of antibiotics, they gave him attitude --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- because he came back completely different.  I wasn't sure he was our cat if I did -- you know, if he didn't answer or look at us when we called his name, we wouldn't be completely sure he was ours, because he is -- he -- he came back with um such an attitude.  He -- we have another cat, that they always fought, but she would -- she would walk by and she would just slap him --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and he'd just take it, you know?  He came back and from then on, he never took it.  He'll back her into a corner and this has been going on for two years now [LAUGH].
R:  So he had, like, had enough.  Yeah.  Okay.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, I guess after all those years, he's like, "Okay.  I -- I almost died and I'm not taking it any more".  [LAUGH].
R:  Do you know, it's funny --
L:  And --
R:  -- they have this sort of a -- uh, cats have this sort of like almost like brother, sister relationship --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when they ha- we had uh -- we had -- once we -- we did have two cats, overlapping ones, and there -- there was a big tom and he was -- he was the big tom.  He was the king of the roost and we had this little girl cat who we used to say if she was a human, she'd be a super model.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- she was really pretty, but dumb.  Oh, it was --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- ridiculous.  She would walk into walls and she would --
L:  Oh [LAUGH].
R:  She once -- she caught one whole mouse, Mindy, that I can recall.  One.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  And she -- you know how they toss them up in the air when they're so pleased --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  -- when they have it?  Well, she tossed it and she lost it and it was about a foot away from her, and could she find it?  We were all so proud of her because Misses finally got a mouse, but --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- she was stunned, but gorgeous, beautiful.  She was the super model of all cats, but they had this relationship where it was -- she was just subservient to him.  There was no way that he was going --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- to let her, you know, be like the big --
L:  She was --
R:  -- cat?
L:  Our big cat, she's -- she's bigger than he is.  Uh, she's -- she's a fluffy cat and she's -- she weighs almost twelve pounds --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and he weighs -- he weighs probably about eight and a half pounds --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and -- and then we've got -- the other weighs about seven pounds.  She's really tiny.
R:  And do they all get along?
L:  Um, the two -- the boy and the big cat, they don't get along very well.
R:  Okay.
L:  But uh I mean, not -- you -- you couldn't put them together in a room and close the door.  It wouldn't --
R:  You could or couldn't?
L:  Wouldn't work.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But um, you know, as far as most of the time they get along.  There's a little growling and, you know, she growls a lot, but she runs from him now, where she didn't used to.
R:  Well, the -- you know, I read somewhere that, like, that was supposed to be the best gift you could give your cat, especially if you weren't going to be home all day, was another cat.
L:  Right.
R:  Because they were good company for each other.
L:  Well, they were good when it was two, but when we brought him into the picture, um, the other -- she -- she's real territorial, I guess --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and -- and our other cat, she's a calico and she's real quiet and calm and -- and she doesn't let anything affect her.
R:  Okay.
L:  And so the big cat always -- she's always been able to just be the boss, you know --
R:  Yeah.  I love a calico.
L:  -- and then he came in and -- and you know, he was a tom cat at the time and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- we had him -- you know, we had him neutered, but he's still, you know, the bo- he was the man of the house --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  -- and [LAUGH].  
R:  I know.  We neutered our tom as well and it didn't much matter.  He was still the tom and his -- his attitude with -- and she would actually groom him, the super model cat would --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- groom him.  And I would be like, "Oh, please", you know?  
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  But she didn't -- she didn't know much better, you know?  She --
L:  Yeah.
R:  She was -- and -- and they did, they got along, but they didn't really interact all that much.  He sort of tolerated her as she adored him and that worked well for him [LAUGH].  You know, he was okay with that.  If you want to adore me, that's fine.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  But honestly, because they're -- because we've always had outdoor cats, we -- we had a dog, we've had a couple of dogs, actually.  Um, the last one didn't work out quite so well 'cause he just grew at an enormous pace.  He just --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he became huge over the course of about four weeks, to the --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- point where only my oldest child could walk him.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  And he -- he dragged everybody else.  He was a -- uh, we were told a Shepherd mix --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- but the other -- I guess the mix was Husky, I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Because it was just huge, and it went from this little tiny, flop eared puppy to, like, demon dog.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  And my -- and -- and finally just -- my oldest daughter is fifteen and she was the only one that could -- that could walk him.  The other three just literally got dragged all over the road.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  So they just went, "No, we don't want to walk him", so we ended up giving him away to a better ho- a better home.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, just a single guy who could uh -- you know, who could walk him without being drug- and who could, you know --
L:  Play with him and --
R:  Yeah, play with him --
L:  -- out --
R:  -- and he was one of these dogs that um responded well to males.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But not so well to females.
L:  And there're a lot like that.
R:  Yeah.  He was -- well, like I guess maybe might have been the breed.
L:  Yes.
R:  And um so he really -- he tolerated me, but he really didn't listen to me, and um but my hu- he listened to my husband who --
L:  And then being a Shepherd mix, you never know, if he's not going to listen to you, what --
R:  No.
L:  -- what --
R:  He --
