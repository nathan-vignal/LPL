L:  Hello.
R:  Hello. 
L:  I'm David.
R:  I'm Elise --
L:  Nice to --
R:  -- how are you?
L:  I'm fine, how are you?
R:  Good.
L:  [SIGH] Well, I guess, considering the topic, most important thing I can think of that I found in my wife is --
R:  Could you speak a little louder?
L:  Oh, I'm sorry --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- is this better?  Uh, I said, the most important thing I found in my wife, I guess, is her compassion.
R:  And what about the compatibility?
L:  Well, considering that we met on the internet --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  And we took about a year to get to know one another before I moved up here.
R:  So, in other words, you were exchanging, uh, emails and all of that?
L:  Right.
R:  And you got to know each other that way?
L:  Right and I c- --
R:  So, you knew about each other?
L:  Right and I came up and met her kids and she came down and met my family.
R:  That's great.  So, how long have you been together?
L:  Uh, we've been together -- it'll be three years July first, but we've been married for just a little over a year.
R:  That's fabulous.  And you think you d- [MN] -- she's the right person for you for your life?
L:  She is the perfect person for me.
R:  And had you been looking before, or had you been married before?
L:  No, I've never been married before, uh, I wasn't really looking for love when I met Penny, we met on a friendship site.  And we were just friends, we lived about three hundred miles apart and w- -- our friendship just kept growing int- -- into love.
R:  Well, that's good that -- the way it started, you know, and it built up --
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, I -- I don't -- I'm single and, you know, I don't have a life partner and I -- I live in New York City and, I guess, you live in -- out of town?
L:  I live in a small town -- it's Gate City, Virginia.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, New York, uh, it's a lot different.  There's, uh, you know, a lot of people who are single who -- who do look for other, you know, partners, but it's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [SIGH] it is difficult, um, and I don't have, uh, [MN] you know -- I know everybody has a computer, but I have yet to g- -- [LAUGH] got -- to get one --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so, I'm, like -- but, you know, I try to go and meet people in different ways, like, in clubs --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or, you know, seminars where people, I think, um, like, compatibility and shared interests --
L:  Right.
R:  -- are very important to a relationship.
L:  Yeah, you're right.
R:  And the person should have that in common.  And, uh, you know, there has to be some -- some kind of connection.
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  You know, like, um, intellectual and maybe spiritual --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what is your strongest connection, is it intellectual or, you know?
L:  Uh, actually, I think it's spiritual.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Um, I've -- I've felt, ever since we really got to be together, that God meant for us to be together.
R:  Really?  So, you believe it was fated?
L:  Yeah, I -- I believe, you know, there's supposedly one true soulmate out there for everybody.  And I figure it took me thirty nine years to find mine.
R:  Really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, you mean the people you dated in the past -- nobody can compare to this person you've found?
L:  No, no, I c- -- I have never felt as good as I feel when I'm with Penny or as loved.
R:  [MN] So, when you met her and you became interested after a time, you moved, is that it, yeah?
L:  Yeah, um, we -- the first time she came down Toronto to meet me and then I came up on New Year's weekend nineteen ninety nine, two thousand --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I met her kids and I spent the weekend up here [NOISE] and then she c- -- they came back in Toronto one more time and then it was decided that I would move up here.  Uh, my family had all spread out, I was by myself down there, so I figured it was just the best way you go.
R:  From -- from the way you tell the story it really sounds like it was fated.
L:  I honestly believe so.
R:  Yeah, you know, because it was just, like, meant at the right place at the right time.
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  And everything and, uh -- so th- -- it's a great story and, uh, you know --
L:  [MN] She had -- she had -- has two kids which are my stepkids now.  Have a fourteen year old daughter and a twelve year old son.
R:  Yeah, so she was divorced then?
L:  Yes. [MN] When I first --
R:  And -- and you're happy with her kids and everything?
L:  Oh yeah, I mean they're --
R:  Oh, that's great.
L:  -- they're great kids, uh, you know, you go from not having any kids to having two practical teenagers, that's kind of wild, but --
R:  They're like -- you have a whole family.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I -- I kind of married into a family and --
R:  But -- but it was a family you wanted to marry in?
L:  Right, and the thing was we -- we made sure the kids understood that we weren't going to get married unless they okayed it.  I mean, we sat 'em down --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we talked to 'em --
R:  Well, evidently they really liked you.
L:  Well, it took time, I mean --
R:  Yeah.  But, do you think, um, just generally, that -- that people generally should have a life partner?
L:  [SIGH] Well, [SIGH] I think it --
R:  'Cause, I mean -- excuse me, if you hadn't gone on the internet and you just didn't do that and you would have just kept dating and, you know, going --
L:  Well, by the time, I had actually given up.
R:  Really?
L:  Um, I was -- like I say, I was thirty eight, thirty nine years old and, you know, I'm not ashamed to admit, I was still living with my mother because my f- -- when my father passed away --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I moved in with her to help her out --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I was contented to be in my bedroom with my television and my --
R:  So, what made you go on the internet?
L:  Well, [LAUGH] the funny thing is I had -- my -- I had to quit my job because I got to the point where I couldn't work and when I got my disability, I got my first check and it was a large check and I says, "I'm going to buy my c- -- self a computer".
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, and that's how it started?
L:  Right.   See, that's what I was telling you, it's all connected.
R:  It was all connected, it was all leading up to it?
L:  Right.
R:  And so it shows you you can't give up.
L:  No, exactly.
R:  And, uh, so now y- -- so, you -- you're really happy and you've found who you were looking for?
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, do you think generally, that everybody should have a life partner?
L:  Really, to be completely honest, I think it's just up to the individual, that -- to see --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what they need.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, some people are completely happy -- I know a guy who's been a bachelor for -- and he's sixty years old -- he never been married.
R:  And he's happy?
L:  And he's happy, he dates, and he, you know --
R:  Then he must have a lot of friends?
L:  Yeah, exactly.  It's just, I think, your situation dictates the way you should go.
R:  Yeah, but I guess, you know, it's always good -- you know, it's good to be alone, but not always.
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  And, I think, as people get older, you know, they realize that more.
L:  Right.
R:  Because, you know, people move away, people, you know, have relationships and then, you know, it's hard for a single person to remain friends with the people who were married, who were --
L:  Right.
R:  -- 'cause I know people who are married, who are in couples and, you know, they tend to have their own lives --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and then, uh, single people have to, you know, find other people who are in the same situation --
L:  Right.
R:  -- who are looking and as you get older it's harder to find.  You know, in New York City --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, people in their thirties, you know, younger people, it's easier than, you know, people who -- who are older, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- a little older --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because, uh, it's -- it's harder to find men.  And the other thing is you get set in your ways --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [LAUGH] and, you know, you have certain habits and then it's hard to meet someone who's not, you know, who may be also have been alone, living alone and they're set in their ways and it's interesting, but I know a few couples in New York City who have relationships but never live together.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, they have their own apartments --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- oh, I think so -- is that -- is that the end of it?
L:  Uh, no, I think what that means is my battery's going to go dead on me.  Hang on, we switch to my other phone, just --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- fortunately I have another phone here --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- if I can get up, my cat won't [NOISE] let me up. [MN] Oh, I hope I make it before this thing dies .
R:  Was that your cell?
L:  No, it's just a cordless phone.
R:  Oh, and the battery -- see, that's what happens to my cell -- 
L:  [NOISE] Right. [NOISE] 
R:  -- that's what I needed -- hello?
L:  Yeah, I'm still here, I'm [inaudible] --
R:  Okay, yeah, so, um, you know, I guess, you know, I -- I would like to meet someone and, uh, you know, whether it's for life, I don't know, I mean, it's hard to -- you know --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- you want it to be for life and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- everything --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and, uh, but you believe everybody -- there's somebody for everybody?
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, I believe they're -- they're out there, it's just a matter of being able to find them.
R:  Yeah, but I -- but your story -- you know, I've heard a lot of stories about the internet and people getting married from the people, you know, you know, because maybe it's a safer way, 'cause you develop it gradually --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and you don't see the person and -- wh- -- did you ever see her, like, through pictures on, you know --
L:  She sent me, uh, a picture that she had, but it was a -- one of those -- what you call, glamor shots?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Where she was all made up special --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, uh, I sent her one of me that I had, which was just me in a p- -- sitting round --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- which was not really a good picture but [LAUGH] --
R:  Could I ask you something, how -- so, how many -- how many conversations did you think you had over the course of time?
L:  We talked practically every day, either through ICQ or email and then, later, the telephone.  We talked every day from the, uh, time we met.
R:  And -- and you thought you had a lot o- -- in common?
L:  Oh we -- we -- we would talk for hours, sometimes about nothing.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You just felt the connection?
L:  Right.
