R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, my name is Rose.
R:  Hi, I'm Mira.
L:  Laura?
R:  Mira.
L:  Mira, hi.
R:  Hi.  How are you?
L:  Well, I guess we're gonna have to talk about pets.
R:  Pets.
L:  Do you have pets?
R:  Um, no, I don't.  
L:  See, neither do I.
R:  Do you?
L:  No, not anymore.  I did.  I've had dogs, cats.  Of course I had children.  They all grew up and left home --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I think we had everything from frogs to turtles, birds --
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- snakes.  We had every pet in the world I think.  [LAUGH]
R:  We had a dog, uh, a rabbit and fish, which I managed to kill [LAUGH] while I was growing up --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then I got some more and then they ended up at my Grandpa's place when I moved out for school.
L:  Ah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Now, see, I don't have, uh -- I moved from California here not too long ago.  Well, about two years ago.
R:  Where do you live?
L:  I -- I'm in Florida now and -- but I moved from California two years ago and I left my pets with a friend of mine and, uh -- because I was traveling for about three months.  Anyway --
R:  Oh, neat.
L: -- and then when I moved down here to Florida she didn't wanna -- I had a dog and she said, "No, I don't want to send your dog.  I wanna keep her".  So, I said, "Okay.  Fine.  Keep her" --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you know?  [LAUGH]  So, I don't have a pet.
R:  What kinda dog was it?
L:  It was -- it was one that I got in an an- animal shelter.
R:  Oh, nice.
L:  Yeah.  I just ...  Yeah.  I wish I had a dog here, but I don't -- the house I live in now doesn't have a fenced in yard --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I work -- I'm still working fulltime.  So, you know, I don't really think it's fair to the dog to be locked up all day, you know?
R:  Yeah.  I grew up with a Golden Retriever, um, and then I went -- well, my parents took care of it when I went away to college and then it passed away and then I had fish.  I had a rabbit [LAUGH] in college, which I brought home, but it got so -- he was supposed to be snake food and then we -- I adopted him --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and he grew so big he was the size of a dog and we couldn't keep him in the house anymore.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?
R:  We had to give him away.  He was huge and, um -- and he like hurt his foot and the medical bills were like five hundred dollars.  So ...
L:  See that's -- I think that's one of the reasons I don't have pets anymore either 'cause they're very expensive to, you know, um ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  I wouldn't mind having a dog or a cat or something like that, but -- if somebody gave me ...
R:  Fish are fine 'cause --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they're cheap and then if they die like so what.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Well ...  I did have one of those, um, Beta fish.  It was given to me for Christmas.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  And, uh, about -- actually about -- a little over a month ago it died, you know?  It just -- I don't know why it ...
R:  You don't even feel sad.  You're just like oh, okay.
L:  Well, I know.  Well, I felt kinda bad though 'cause I thought gee, maybe it died from loneliness 'cause I'm never home.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  You know what it's like?
R:  I had --
L:  But I doubt it.
R:  -- I had a couple of fish that were supposed to live like a few months and they're about four years old now living with my grandfather --
L:  Oh, that's ...
R:  -- 'cause I got them in college and I was like they'll all be dead by the time I'm graduated --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it's like been four years [LAUGH] and they're still alive and I've no idea why.  But [LIPSMACK], yeah, they're ...
L:  Have you -- have you graduated yet?
R:  Yeah, I'm in law school now.
L:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH]  I was gonna say ...
R:  I'm heading for year seven.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  My last year.
L:  Good.  Good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Then you can go get a pet of your own, you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  But my apartment doesn't allow them right now.
L:  Oh.
R:  So -- and then I'm probably gonna move again and I don't -- you know, I'll be working.  So, I don't even know how people have pets.  [LAUGH]  But ...
L:  Yeah.  Well, especially if you live in a city.
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.
L:  Do you have time ...?  Yeah.  You get home and -- and I just -- I don't live in a big city.  I live out in -- you know, in a little like suburb type part of Tampa, but it's kind of ...
R:  They have like dog parks and stuff, but I think it's kinda cruel --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like to leave a dog in an apartment all day and then there are cats, but then they w- wreck all your furniture and I don't know.  I guess ...
L:  Yeah.  Well, you -- you could have a cat declawed, but then if you did that --
R:  That's cruel I think.
L:  -- then you can't never let it outside.  Yeah.  Yeah, 'cause it couldn't protect itself from anything so ...
R:  It really it's -- it's horrible for them and like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- hurts them terribly if they're declawed and if you let 'em like stay clawed then your furniture has gone to hell and ...
L:  Yes.  Unless you're home with them all the time -- [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- which I never am.
R:  And I figure I probably wanna have kids within the next fifteen years and cats get really possessive and they might like hurt kids and stuff.  So ...
L:  Yeah.  I don't think they intentionally hurt 'em.  It's just like if they smell the m- -- the milk on their breath they'll get up and lay on their chest and start licking on their face and because they're heavy they can crush their lungs, you know?
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  Yeah.  So, you really have to watch when you have pets like that.
R:  Yeah.  The Golden Retriever was perfect.  We got him when I was about four and they're so good with kids and he was real like docile and would just lie down at your feet.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  He was real good with kids.  But, um, I don't know.  There's some dogs that I wouldn't wanna around -- like Rottweilers or German Shepherds and I don't think you want those around little kids.
L:  You know what?  I think, um -- yeah, 'cause dogs are dogs.  When they get that big even if they don't intentionally hurt 'em, you know, they just -- and besides that I think Rottweilers have been inbred so much that they -- they have a tendency to be kinda mean.
R:  Yeah, they're dangerous dogs I think.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Some of them can be okay if they're trained well, but I got -- I got bite right through the hand by my friend's German Shepherd 'cause he didn't -- he wasn't paying attention.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I can't imagine like having that around little kids.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  They're real possessive too of their owner, but ...
L:  Yeah.  I wouldn't wanna have that -- a dog like that around either.
R:  Yeah.
L:  My -- my dog was small, you know?  I mean, not -- not tiny, tiny small, but about the size of a little Poodle, you know, not a Toy Poodle, but a little size, just ...
R:  Oh, that's a good size.
L:  Yeah, it was.  She was a good size for the house and around and, you know, of course 'cause I worked and I had a doggie door so she could come in and out when she wanted.  So, that was fine, you know?  But I didn't feel bad about leaving her home alone.
R:  Yeah.  Our dog grew to be about like a hundred and ten pounds or something, but he grew a lot faster than I did 'cause I was four when I got him.  So, he would -- he outweighed me pretty quickly.
L:   [LAUGH]
R:  Then I'd try and take him for a walk, but he would just drag me along.  [LAUGH]  He was so much bigger.  He was huge.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um ...
L:  Well, I think animals can be a lotta fun and a lotta company really.
R:  Yeah.  I'm still wondering like when you can get one, like what time?  I guess when you have a house and kids maybe and ...
L:  Probably when your child- -- when you're gonna have children when -- maybe when they're three or four years old because prior to that you're so busy with babies and kids and -- and helping them do everything, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- 'cause up to about three kids don't do much by themselves, you know, and don't dress themselves or ...
R:  When they go to school they can still --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they can help take care of 'em and they're big enough to fight 'em off.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Right.  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know.  Yeah.
L:  Well, I don't know if it's, um -- they really should be -- have to fight off a dog [LAUGH], but play with them anyway.
R:  No.  No.  No.  I mean --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I mean, if they like jump on 'em or something --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- that their lungs won't collapse.  But ...
L:  But you don't wanna wait too long because then the kids get like they're afraid of a dog or something, you know?  So ...
R:  Yeah.  I was afraid of dogs 'til we got one and then --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you get over it pretty fast.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] The rabbit ...
L:  Well, my kids were never afraid of dogs unfortunately.  So ...  [LAUGH]
R:  Unfortunately?
L:  Yeah.  We always had dogs, at least one.  If some stray got left out someplace they would drag it home with 'em.  I mean, we had Spaniels --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- Cocker Spaniels and oh, we had all kinds of dogs and cats and ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  But they helped take care of 'em so, you know?
R:  Yeah.  We -- I don't know.  We -- we had one dog and I think it was just -- it's expensive to keep an animal --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- especially like when they get sick and the medical bills start piling in and I think they have dog insurance now, like health insurance for your pets, but they won't insure them after a certain age.
L:  Yeah.  Well, we didn't have that when my dogs ...  In fact, I remember with one of our dogs -- we had a -- my mother in law had given us a Schnauzer.
R:  Yeah.
L:  She -- she raised him.  So, she gave us this Schnauzer and we had it bred and then she had so much problems and so we had to go have a Cesarean section on this dog.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  Oh, it was a mess.  I'm telling ya I spent more money on my pets at the veterinarian than I ever did my children at the pediatrician.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] It was like unbelievable.  So, I ...
R:  My -- my aunt and uncle -- I was actually just pet sitting for them and they have a little like Shih-tzu or something like that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I'm not -- I'm not a fan of like tiny dogs 'cause they bark a lot and what not, but they don't have kids so they just have a dog [LAUGH] and they think it worked out well for them 'cause they like the dog just fine and they travel a lot and it's like ...
L:  Yeah.  Well, our little -- the Schnauzer we had didn't bark a lot though, but I think it's because like I -- I have four children, I had four daughters --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I think between the four kids the dog didn't have a chance, you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  He just got a lot of attention.
L:  Just let me ...  Yeah.  I mean, he really got a lot of attention so ...
R:  That's good.
L:  It wasn't one of those yappy ones or ...  But I couldn't believe how much you'd spend on a vet even back, you know, thirty years ago.  So, I was like oh, my goodness!
R:  Yeah.  Well, they do all the same things they do on people, you know?  They don't -- people don't -- people think of them as like parts of the family, they don't wanna put 'em down even if it's like the cost of a big operation, you know?  A girlfriend of mine in -- in law school she doesn't have any money to spend, but her cat needed surgery --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [LAUGH] and it was gonna cost her a couple of thousand dollars and I was like at some point the cat's just gotta go.  I mean, you can't -- you can't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- keep having surgeries on the animal and not the animal either.
L:  Yeah.  The only reason I went ahead and had the Cesarean on the -- on the dog was because she was -- you know, she was like only about two years old and she -- other than that she was healthy.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.
L:  But I've had dogs put down.  I mean, when they get to be old and they're not eating or they're, you know -- then I take 'em to the doctor ...
R:  Yeah.  Ours ended up having lupus.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know what that is?
L:  Yes, I do know what lupus is.  Yes.
R:  He got -- he had arthritis in his leg.  He was already like fifteen years old.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, um [LIPSMACK], that's still a pretty good lifespan for a dog.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I've had dogs that I put down at -- at like age ten they -- they developed tumors and the doctor said, "Well, we can do surgery, do a biopsy and see if it's malignant or not".  No, just put the dog down, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because you can't -- a dog that's ten, eleven, twelve years old even if you do do surgery on them and you find out, you know, well, we can remove the tumor and it's not malignant or it is malignant you're putting the dog through a lot, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And nobody's -- especially when you work and you're not there all day to be with the animal.
R:  And they're an animal, you know, they're not ...
L:  Yeah, and their our animals.  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.
L:  But, see, I grew up on a farm as well.  So, an animal's an animal, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  They belong out in the barn.  [LAUGH]
R:  I think that's probably a healthier perspective [LAUGH] of --
