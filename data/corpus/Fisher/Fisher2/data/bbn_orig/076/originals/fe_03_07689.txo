R:  [NOISE] Yeah, hello.  My name's Danny.
L:  Oh, hi.  I'm Mary.  I'm calling from Vancouver.  [NOISE]
R:  Vancouver, uh, in --
L:  Canada.
R:  -- Canada?
L:  Canada.  Yeah, where are you from?
R:  I'm --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in Los Angeles, California.
L:  Oh, wow.  Uh --
R:  We're a long ways away.
L:  That's right.  Took them a long time to find [LAUGH] someone --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- someone for me to go with it.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  So, um, I -- yeah, I met my husband when I was fifteen and I'm forty seven now so I guess I -- whatever I did, it was right.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I wish I could say that.  I've -- I've --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- had two marriages.  One lasted --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, fourteen years.  [LIPSMACK] The other lasted twelve.  [LIPSMACK] Uh, I have three wonderful children from my first marriage.
L:  Oh.
R:  And three incredible little grand daughters.
L:  So, did you marry pretty young or ...?
R:  [SIGH] Actually, um, I was twenty when I married and she was eighteen.
L:  Yeah, that's just like my husband and I.  We're b- -- I mean, really, in some ways I think it's kind of luck because when I think at that age you really change so much.  You know, what -- you know the person you are at eighteen, nineteen, twenty, you're not --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- later --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so, but --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- my husband and I seemed to just sort of grow together --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and ...
R:  Yeah, in -- in -- in retrospect, uh, when I look back on my first marriage, I mean, I grew one way, she grew the other --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and -- and we kinda deceived ourselves and each other that we were doing it for the kids.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, er, it -- it just caught up to us.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Fortunately it wasn't an ugly, uh, divorce but I mean, n- n- no divorce is fun.
L:  No.
R:  [SIGH] And, uh, I'm, uh -- I'm not sure that I would agree that it's luck.  I -- I really think there's, uh -- you know, I mean I've done it enough and I've been married, uh, twenty six years of my fifty years --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- on the planet.  That I -- I mean, it's -- it's work.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and the willingness to work and obviously you and your husband have been together many, many, many years.
L:  Yeah, and mind --
R:  And --
L:  -- you have to have a lot of interests the same.  Like, we do have a lot of interests the same but -- and we give each other our space too.  You know, he likes to do things in his --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- workshop, you know, and I like to do things myself --
R:  Y-
L:  -- and ...
R:  Y- yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a -- 
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- that's a good point.  I mean, uh, to me space is everything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I -- it's -- it's so important that to be able to, you know.  And when you have to account for your whereabouts all the time and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, who you're with and whose --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that and ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I -- I -- it was a very real problem in my first marriage.  Not so much --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in my second.
L:  So, you -- if you have grandchildren, you were pretty young then when you had kids?  [SIGH]
R:  Uh, [SIGH] --
L:  [MN]
R:  Well, I'm fifty now.
L:  Yeah, [MN].
R:  My oldest granddaughter is eight.
L:  I g- -- my husband and I, actually that was the other thing we did.  I don't know if it's good or bad but it took us a long time to have children so we --
R:  Really?
L:  -- actually were married maybe fifteen years before we had kids.
R:  Ah, no we --
L:  So, those were incredible years.  I mean, we did a lot --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and ...
R:  No, the greatest joy of my life has been those six girls.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I mean, I -- I -- and I've told my first wife that.  I s- you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  "I'm not trying to be funny but I would publicly kiss your rear end --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- t- to thank you for, you know."
L:  Yeah.
R:  "Just the fact that, you know, you bore those three [MN]."
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  And she thinks I'm silly but I'm, you know.  
L:  So, are you -- do you think --
R:  [COUGH] I -- I mean, fathers and daughters is very unique you know.
L:  Yes, yes.  
R:  Very -- I'm sure --
L:  Do you think you would try to get married again or ...?
R:  Uh, you know at my age and -- and I -- I write and I do research and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I do travel a lot.  Uh, you know, I'd really have to find somebody that, you know.
L:  Wanted to --
R:  Either wanted to travel [LAUGH] a lot or just didn't care that I [LAUGH] did, you know. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I'm --
L:  But --
R:  -- on the road a lot and, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [COUGH] matter of fact, I just got back from Pennsylvania [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, uh, I don't know.  I mean, I've met a lot of, you know, very nice ladies.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, and I do enjoy female company but --
L:  But I guess the whole world is different.  You don't have to be married now.  When we were in our twen- -- you know, that age, you did have to be.  
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  Yes, I mean it's not --
R:  Yeah, and I -- and the oth- -- and the cultural taboo of, you know, staying together and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, even if you made a mistake --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I know.
L:  Which I think is very sad.  I know somebody who's been married for probably almost fifty years and cannot stand her husband.  I mean, they -- she has to keep working.  She's like almost seventy --
R:  Oh, jeez.
L:  -- because she cannot stay ho- -- I mean, can you imagine why would you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- do that?  Like -- you know, you --
R:  It was nice talking to you, Mary.
L:  Sorry?
R:  I sa- -- I -- I -- I don't know if somebody's breaking in or they're breaking in.
L:  Oh, I'm not, uh -- I'm -- I'm here.
R:  Yeah, but I won't answer it.
L:  [inaudible] yeah.
R:  But, uh, yeah, that's awful.
L:  Yeah, and you think like, "Why would you do that?" you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, but --
R:  Well, I -- when -- when my [MN] -- fortunately -- well, not fortunately but I mean, at least I'm glad my mother didn't see me get divorced 'cause, [NOISE] you know, she's just an old Mexican lady that, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That believed in, you know, the sanctity of it all, whether it was good or bad.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's like my family, yes.
R:  Yeah, and, uh, [MN] yeah.
L:  There's been no -- no divorce whatsoever on my side with, you know -- it's a Catholic family and it's just not heard of, you know.
R:  Yeah, well my Mom would have just -- oh, Jesus, she might have threatened to kill me for all I know.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  But, uh, for- -- n- not fortunately, 'cause I -- I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I still miss her dearly but --
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  -- at least she didn't have to see that.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, that's what -- my Mom passed away last year so I know how that feels.  It's pretty sad.
R:  Yeah, yeah, that was tough but, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, uh, I don't know, you know.  I just, uh -- I just think it's a -- y- you gotta be wil- willing to work --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and -- and that person's gotta make you wanna work.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I mean I've had jobs where I've worked eighteen hours a day as -- and something makes you want to do that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it not only obligation or bills being paid but--
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you gotta want something bad enough.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But you know what, I find is so scary is you get these relationships where people have been married, say, twenty five years and all of a sudden one of them comes home and says, "I've never been happy.  I want out."
R:  Jesus.
L:  But the other person didn't know.  Then that happens sometimes.  I think that is worse, you know.  Like, how could you live with someone all those years and not know that they weren't happy?
R:  Y- y- you know what?  I -- I mean, it sounds silly but I mean, I -- I understand it. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, because so much of what we do is, uh [LIPSMACK] -- you know, w- w- -- it's like we're self programmed, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We get up, we brush our teeth with the right hand, we --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  I mean, like me.  I always shave with my left hand but I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know and why, I don't have a clue.  [LAUGH] But I [LAUGH] -- you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I'm right handed, you know.  So I -- why do I do that?  I don't know.  It just --
L:  Yeah, so you mean you can just go along and along and then you don't really --
R:  And not pay attention, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or -- or m- or maybe, you know, I -- I think sometimes we wanna be numb to it all.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  We just -- we just don't wanna feel it any more.
L:  Yeah, so you would be pretty careful if you met someone else and ...?
R:  Well, yeah [MN] [SIGH] -- I really just think it's a maturity thing now, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I'm fifty and I would say, "Look, what you see is what you get."  You know.  And if [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if you can handle, you know, we give it a shot and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and if you can't, just be hon- -- tell me 'cause --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, I'm enjoying myself.  I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'm fifty years old and to be quite frank I'm enjoying the hell out of myself.
L:  Yeah, yeah, I think it's a pretty good age, um ...
R:  Yeah, I mean, you know, I've got grandkids who I just -- I mean, my daughters just despise the way I spoil them --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, but, uh, you know, that's my --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's my joy.  [LAUGH] You know?
L:  That's right.  That's what that's all about.
R:  And, uh, I'm lucky I have three so I see at least one of them every day.
L:  Yeah, oh, that's excellent
R:  You know and when I'm on the road I -- I call them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  I even tell my daughters, you know, that I, yeah -- I don't need to talk to you guys any more.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I wanna talk to the little people.
L:  Going on to the little ones.
R:  Yeah, 'cause, well, their fun.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  
L:  That sounds like a good --
R:  And they think Pop --  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.
L:  I was gonna say that sounds like a nice family.  I mean, even though you've got divorce in the family, it's still -- that's nice.
R:  Well, I'm lucky.  I mean I'm very close to all three of my children.
L:  Yes.
R:  And, you know, they're all kinda daddy's girls.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you know, I mean people see us together and they say, "Who's -- wh- who's man?"  So "That's our Dad" and they say, "Well, God, you guys act like you're friends," you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and that -- and that's a learned behavior.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, 'cause when they coming up and God, the teen years.  Oh my God.
L:  I was -- I've got that -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I've got that to come.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, okay so you have a daughter --
L:  I -- my --
R:  -- that's --
L:  -- my son is twelve and my daughter's ten.  But my ten year old daughter acts like she's fifteen now --
R:  Oh, jeez.
L:  -- so I can only imagine, you know.
R:  Well, I had three.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and my two -- my two older girls are just a year and a half apart.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So they were a load.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I mean -- and it would go through s- -- and, you know -- and people say, "Well, how did you s- -- how did you do it?"  
L:  Mm.
R:  I says, "You know that -- I gotta tell ya.  I've f- -- I've figured out what the word patience meant" [LAUGH] you know.
L:  Yeah, so -- and how do you warn them about like [MN] relationships --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  That's kind of -- 
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- you know.  'Cause everyb- --
R:  Well, basic- 
L:  You have --
R:  Yeah, no, that's a good.  Well, basically, you know, what I do?  I tell 'em, you know.  "You can love 'em through anything."
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, you can just love 'em through anything and no matter how bad.  I said, "But when you start -- when you start disliking" you know?
L:  Yes.
R:  "Or you start using the word 'hate'" --
L:  Yes.
R:  I said, you know, "You're going in the wrong direction."
L:  That's right.  Then it's time for out.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, for me, I mean, y- you know, when my daughter's were bad, I loved them as hard as I could --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and when they were good, I pushed them as hard as I could.
L:  Yeah, oh, that's a good --
R:  I challenged them, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I said, "What do you mean, a B. plus?" You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  But when they were bad, I hugged them, told them I loved them and said, you know, "If you do it again, I'm gonna hug you and tell you I love you again."
L:  Yeah, oh that's really nice. 'Cause my daughter can be quite challenging and, uh, yeah, when you get angry with them, that is what they need really, isn't it?
R:  Yeah, I -- I mean I just -- I just said, you know, "I -- I can't lo- --"  [MN] I think you come to the realization that you can't lose.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And once you do that, you say, w- I mean, I don't care how unconventional.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't care how unusual.  Whatever it takes I must win.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because when the children win, you know, you have chaos.
L:  Yeah, I know.  
R:  [SIGH]
L:  It's just [inaudible] a lot of people are telling me just to make sure to pick your battles when they get to be teenagers.  I --
R:  Well, I think that's solid advice.  You know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if you -- if you fight 'em on every front --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- eventually they wear you out.  Because the truth is they got more energy than you.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they just have this boundless energy.
L:  Yeah, so what time?  When?  What age does it start to get really bad?
R:  Uh, with mine it was like fifteen.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  You know, and -- and i- i- i- and it was unusual because the fifteen year old very much affected the thirteen and a half year old.
L:  Yeah.
R:  In both a negative and positive way.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, but, uh -- but fortunately for me they were very close.  So it -- when I -- when I picked the battle, I -- I fought 'em both but it was over.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I didn't have to say, "Oh, you know, Jesus.  In another six month or not, we have to -- you know, I'll have to do this with that way."  [LAUGH] --
L:  So --
R:  [inaudible] --
L:  -- when -- when --
R:  -- I kinda bundled them together.
L:  -- when you ended up getting divorced, did that affect your relationship with your children or ...?
R:  [MN] [MN] Only -- only in a sense that --
