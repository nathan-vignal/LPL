R:  Hello, this is Lane.
L:  Hi, my name's Christina.
R:  Hey, Christina, I'm calling from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, today --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- how about you?
L:  I'm in Boston, Massachusetts.
R:  How about that?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's quite a difference. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, exactly. [SIGH] Still --
L:  All right --
R:  The t- --
L:  -- the topic today is life partners, huh?
R:  Mhm.
L:  All right.  I -- I don't if I'm a very good person to be talking about this with right now. [LAUGH] 
R:  Why is that?
L:  I am coming out of a three and a half year relationship --
R:  Mm, okay.
L:  -- with a -- well, I guess I thought he was a life partner. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.   And I'm in a one year relationship right now and things are going well, so -- [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that's excellent, that's good to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- hear.
R:  Well, thanks.
L:  So, do you think this is your life's partner?
R:  I think so --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- um, we've talked about it [MN] quite a bit --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- trying to figure out, you know, those things that we have in common and those things that we don't have in common and [SIGH] we're both pretty much on the same page, um, I'm thirty one --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- my girlfriend is thirty five [SIGH] so I think we're both mature, um, and really see things kind of the same way --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so, um, you know, it -- I, you know -- I think from that perspective I think we're pretty well set.
L:  [MN] Is that what you're looking for?  I mean, I -- I guess what I -- what I'm asking --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- is, uh, I mean, what -- what exactly would be the ideal characteristics --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, of a life partner, aside from those?
R:  Yeah, ideally, I want somebody that has similar interests to mine --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, you know, at the same time, wants to pursue those jointly or separately, um, I want somebody that's independent like me, but at the same time wants to be with people too --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, [MN] I want somebody just as physically active as I am --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, somebody that kind of bring -- you know, has the same kind of background.  I grew up in a suburb, um, she grew up in a suburb --
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  -- you know, kind of a middle class type of thing and I, you know -- I think that is the big characteristic as well. [NOISE] [MN] 
L:  Definitely.
R:  You know, other than that, I don't know too much, um, as far as, you know, what to consider.  Wh- what about you, what ...?
L:  Well, um, most of, uh, the problems that I had here was, um, [LIPSMACK] it was kind of a breakdown in communication --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- um, a serious breakdown in communication, I mean, we lived together for about three years, technically we're still living together 'cause I can't afford to move out yet --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, so, you know, that makes things a little bit difficult, but, I mean, [MN] when we met we had a lot in common and, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, he -- I was looking for someone who was, you know, intelligent, um, I wasn't really looking for ambition and that kind of overwhelmed him --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- uh, since we moved here, uh, because the job is, like, everything so he works, like, ninety hours a week and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- he's angry all the time and he comes home and complains about it [SIGH] and, um, you know, just doesn't even listen, like, he -- he's totally -- gave up on all his social contacts, he doesn't speak with his friends anymore, [MN] all he does is work.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, there was just this massive breakdown where I kept telling him, you know, "Please, call your friends, be human again" basically and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, I really haven't been happy here in -- in Boston and, uh, I told him that I wanted to move when our lease ran out, which would be in August --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and he kept saying, "Oh, yeah, we'll -- we'll -- we'll definitely move" and then in April he said, "Well, guess what, we're not moving" --
R:  Mm.
L:  [SIGH] -- so, there was just, like, this complete, like, utter disregard, I guess, for what we both were trying to accomplish and I suppose the next time around, [LAUGH] if there is a next time around and I guess that there's going to have to be --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'm definitely looking for someone who's going to keep the -- the lines of communication open, whether, you know, we disagree or agree on something that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, you can sit down and you can talk it out like rational people --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- instead of just ignoring the problem and letting it grow and grow until there's just no hope --
R:  [NOISE] Well, let me ask you this --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- um, do you think it's a issue of work life balance -- um, [MN] was -- did he always have a ninety hour a week job --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- over the three and a half years, or ...?
L:  No, not at all --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- um, when he first moved up here he was doing consulting work which he really didn't have a chance to build any, like, professional contacts --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I know that -- that hurt him a lot because, you know, he is looking for people to hang out with that have similar interests and, um, I'm -- [MN] he- he's a computer geek and I'm barely computer literate, [LAUGH] so you -- you can see -- I -- I understood that he needed to go out and find people that were more like him --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] but, uh, where we lived before, most of his best friends were computer geeks and they were all at different companies and none of them had ninety hour work weeks, none of them just lived for the job and none of them just hung out with their co workers --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- you know, they, uh -- they all kind of bonded together, in fact, they even, like, made points of taking time off together and, you know, going off on their own little trips and stuff and it was, you know -- it was very good, it was very healthy. [SIGH] But, when all he does is hang out with the people from work and, you know, drop everything -- like, right now, he's on a business trip in Chicago --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- he worked until -- he worked from, like, seven in the morning until eleven o'clock at night and then had to get up and get on the phone at three o'clock in the morning for an international call --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and then be on a flight by five --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, and he just -- he complains, he's angry, he's upset, but he doesn't stop it.
R:  Well, and that might be something that he needs to analyze for himself --
L:  Right.
R:  -- regardless of how much you tell him and other people tell him, he's not going to change until --
L:  He's willing to.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, I don't know, he's -- he's very, uh, career driven right now and it's definitely, uh, kind of given me -- I -- I like ambition, I -- I used to consider myself an ambitious person, but next to him I am not -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I think probably the next time around, I'm not going to be looking for someone that is, you know, so career oriented that they let everything personal slip by --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- there -- there has to -- I'm looking for someone with more balance, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's, uh, I -- my philosophy was always if you're going to work hard then you should play hard --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, um, I don't know, he just works hard. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mm.  Yeah, it's too bad --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know, because like, my girlfriend and I are both pretty ambitious --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but at the same time, [SIGH] you know, we work forty to fifty hours a week --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- and that's it, um, I could do a lot more, I could move to New York --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, you know, and so on and so forth, but I enjoy what I do, I do consulting work and I also teach part time at a school here --
L:  Oh, very nice.
R:  -- and, you know, I -- am I making as much money as I could?  No.  But at the same time, I -- I think it's important to have kind of a work life balance and that's really allowed my girlfriend and myself to get to know each other a lot better --
L:  Oh, definitely, definitely.
R:  -- and have that much stronger of a relationship. [NOISE]
L:  'Cause you need that, I mean, you need to have that personal connection --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if you're just kind of passing each other, uh, you know, in the night, it's not -- it's not there --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so, definitely --
R:  Yeah, it's, you know, th- th- that's what it sounds like, literally, you're doing, is passing each other in the night --
L:  [LAUGH] Basically, I mean, I -- I -- I haven't had a lot of, uh, work luck here in -- in Boston --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- um, I came up here to get my Masters and I got it and I haven't been able to find anything fulltime --
R:  MBA or --
L:  -- uh, no, no I, uh, was studying journalism --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- so it's a Master of Arts and, um, you know, I -- I haven't been able to find a job and that was another reason why I was so big on wanting to move, you know, I told him I didn't mind, um, working multiple part time jobs and -- and pulling my share of the weight if he was getting the -- the experience that he needed to go on and do something that might make him happier --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] but he has no intention of leaving the company, and I can understand that there're a lot of opportunities here for him, [SIGH] and that's why I'm going to leave and I'm not, you know -- and we just parted ways. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay. [NOISE]
L:  Because we -- I -- that's another thing, with -- with life partners, I think that there comes a time when you either need to be able to compromise or just know that it's time to -- to walk away, but I don't believe that life partnerships should involve, um, oh what's the word I'm looking for -- ultimatums --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] I don't think -- I don't think that's healthy at all [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, so that's definitely something to leave out of [LAUGH] the life partner, uh, equation, um, so I guess in that way, maybe we're a little bit healthier than -- than I thought. [MN]
R:  Okay. [MN] Yeah, I -- I kind of feel the same way, um, you know, my girlfriend is happy with her job --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I have been looking for some full time opportunities to increase my income slightly --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, primarily focussing on Chicago and Milwaukee because those areas are [MN] pretty close to one another --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, but at the same time, I kind of feel like, [SIGH] you know, with the employment market the way it is --
L:  Mm. [NOISE]
R:  -- would it make sense for me to look elsewhere and I think that, you know, that could --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, really cause some difficulties for us --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in a life partner equation, um, you know, right now I'm happy with what I'm doing, but the pay isn't what it could be --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and, you know, my -- my girlfriend realizes that and, you know, I -- I -- I think all in all we'll figure it out, [MN] so, we'll see what happens with it.
L:  [MN] --
