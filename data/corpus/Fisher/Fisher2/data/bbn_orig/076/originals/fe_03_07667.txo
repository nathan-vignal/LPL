R:  [NOISE] Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.  [LAUGH]
L:  Hi.  What's your name?
R:  Uh, my name's Connie.  What's yours?
L:  Chelsea.
R:  Chelsea, hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  Um --
L:  Uh ...
R:  -- well ...  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, where are you from first?
R:  [COUGH] I'm from Los Angeles.  How 'bout you?
L:  Oh, I'm from Utah.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I guess we're supposed to be discussing pets, huh?
L:  Yeah.  Um, I didn't really hear what they said at the beginning and so ...  I mean, I don't have a pet and I've never had a pet.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Do you have any pets?
R:  God, yes [LAUGH], that's why ...
L:  Well, maybe you should do the talking then.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.  Um, okay, yeah.  I actually have four pets.  I have, uh ...
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  I have three cats and a big dog --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- and, um, because I live in a ...
L:  Do you live in an apartment or in a house?
R:  We -- we live in an apartment.  So, it's a bit of a zoo [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and we're -- we're like in a constant struggle to not get more because [LAUGH] we -- we just really like animals.
L:  Whose we, you and ...?
R:  Um, me, my husband and my two step daughters.
L:  Oh, okay.  So, there's four people and four animals?
R:  Uh, right.  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But my girls are older.  They're off in college and so forth.
L:  Oh, so they don't live with you?
R:  So, you know, they're -- they're not here most of the time.
L:  Mm.
R:  But, um, okay.  So, I think they -- they were asking like how much time?
L:  Yeah.
R:  What -- what kinda pets do you have?  How much time do you spend caring for them and what was the rest of it?
L:  Um, what do you fed 'em maybe?  Probably anything that you can think about to say about your pets, like --
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, God ...
L:  -- how long have you had 'em?
R:  Um, well, we -- we got two of our cats in the summer of ninety seven --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then we got one more cat in the summer of ninety eight and then we got our dog two years ago and ...
L:  [MN] And they all get along?
R:  You know, they do get along, but it took a little while.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It did.  Um, 'cause, you know, I think cats are naturally a bit suspicious of dogs and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the cats were also kind of accustomed to ruling the roost, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They weren't -- they weren't really, you know, ready to accommodate a big goofy dog.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, they took a while adjusting and for a while the cats would like arch up and hiss and be kinda mad w- when the dog would come near them --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then for a couple of months they just ignored each other --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and then they began ...  [LAUGH] I know, that was -- so that was kinda tense.
L:  That's kinda interesting.
R:  You know, it was, that's what my husband and I say.  We have like an animal behavior laboratory in the house 'cause [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- it was really interesting to watch the process of how they all got to know each other and adjusted to each other.
L:  Uh-huh.  Huh.
R:  But, um, tell me about you.  Do you -- do you like animals?  Would you -- do you wanna have pets?
L:  Um, let's see.  I -- I probably would not want that many pets --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- in an apartment with me.
R:  That would be wise.
L:  I don't hate -- I don't hate them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I don't absolutely love them.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I kind of actually looked into buying like a little frog --
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- a little while ago because I have a little glass, um -- it's like a goblet, but it's big, like the goblet part is --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- like almost like a fish bowl and it's blue glass and I thought it would be neat to have like a little frog in there or something, but I went right ...
R:  Oh, those are so cute.
L:  Yeah.  I thought it would be fun, but I went right after Christmas and all of the good pets were gone --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I haven't been back since.  So, yeah, that's ...
R:  Where -- where were you looking, like ...?
L:  Oh, my brothers had pets and ...
R:  Sorry?  Oh, I'm sorry.  I was ...
L:  My brothers had pets.
R:  Your brothers do?
L:  Oh, they did.
R:  I'm sorry.  I was taking off my earrings so I missed [LAUGH] what you said.
L:  Oh, they had ...
R:  You were saying ...
L:  What?
R:  You were saying your brothers had pets?
L:  Yeah, they had salamanders and my sister had hamsters for a while.
R:  Oh, so sweet.
L:  Yeah, and like ... Yeah, I don't know.  That's all.  [LAUGH]
R:  What happened to 'em?
L:  Huh?
R:  What happened to 'em?
L:  They all died.
R:  Oh.
L:  Well ...
R:  I know.  I guess they don't really have very long life expectancy, huh?
L:  I don't -- that must be it.  But both of my brothers and my sister were really, really sad when their pets died.
R:  Oh, God, uh ...
L:  Like they loved them, especially my sister and the hamsters.  She'd pick 'em up and play with them all the time, like any time she was in her room she was just like picking them up and playing with them and holding them.
R:  Hamsters are so lovable, you know?  I think any little --
L:  Yeah, they are really cute.
R:  -- furry thing and they're really expressive in their way, you know, and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I think it's -- it's really -- you -- you can't just not attach to 'em.  Salamanders, I don't know.  Like, I like reptiles, snakes and lizards --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and stuff, but I can't imagine you'd have the same kind of, um, affection for 'em.
L:  No.  I don't think they were like connected in any way, but it's just sad when a living thing dies, you know?
R:  It's so sad.
L:  That sorta thing and you can't help but wonder if part of it was your fault or --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- that sort of thing and so I think that pretty much after my brothers and sister had pets that died they quit getting pets.  I think it was hard on them.
R:  Oh, I'm sure it was.
L:  So ...
R:  Oh, yeah, it must've been terrible.  Hard on the whole family I imagine.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Are they older than you?
L:  No, I'm the oldest and --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- I have two younger brothers and a sister.  So ...
R:  When I was a kid we never had pets in my family.  My -- my parents just said, you know, there's too many kids in this house [LAUGH] and we just, you know ...?
L:  Uh-huh.  How many kids were there?
R:  Seven.
L:  Oh, wow!  That is a lotta kids.
R:  It -- it was a mob.  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, they just said, you know, enough -- we have enough like little creatures in the house --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and no pets.  So, it wasn't really wasn't until I was, you know, quite a bit older --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- 'cause, you know, when I was younger it didn't occur to me.  You know, you're young and you're on the go --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you're not home enough to really wanna a pet.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I didn't get into them until I was a bit older and now I just -- I'm just crazy about 'em.
L:  Yeah.  I can see that.  My ...
R:  They really become ...  I mean, it sounds kinda weird but, yeah, they really do become like a part of your family, you know?
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  And they're living creatures, like they have personalities and things that --
R:  [LAUGH] They do.  They really do.
L:  -- help you get attached to them.  Um, my uncle just got two miniature goats.  They're really cute.
R:  No way!
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like -- like pigmy goats?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, my God!
L:  They're really little.  They're like a foot high.
R:  I love pigmy goats.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They're one of my favorite animals.  They have the -- the county fair out here in L.A. every year --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- and that's like the main reason I go is to play with the pigmy goats.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I love them so much.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  He's ...
R:  I hear that they become a little difficult when they get older, but when they --
L:  Really?
R:  -- are so sweet.
L:  Well, he's only had them like a year.  So, I haven't heard about any difficulties yet.  But he, um -- he like built this shed for them that is nicer than his house and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- they're so cute, like when you drive up they can hear a car coming and they just bleat and bleat 'til you come over and look at 'em and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- pat 'em and stuff.  So ...
R:  Do they try to like knock people down?  That's what I've heard about them.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  They get stubborn and they try to like butt you with their heads and like knock you down.
L:  I know that a couple of times like -- well, I know that they like jump on him when he's sitting there, but I don't know if -- if they've tried to knock him down --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- or whether they're big enough too yet or -- I don't know.
R:  They have so much personality.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I really, really like them.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  You kinda need a yard for those though.
R:  I think you do.  I know.  I keep like, you know, threatening my family that I'm gonna bring one home but, you know [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- something tells me that they're -- they're not really cut out for apartment living.
L:  Uh-huh.  Um ...
R:  But someone I met at the county fair who raised 'em said -- you know, she lived kind of out in the more rural area --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- outside of L.A. and she said that, um, she lets hers just come in the house, you know?
L:  Really?
R:  She said they're like dogs.  Yeah.  They hang out with the family and they goof around.  Um, but she said the thing she has to prevent them from doing is eating the phone book.
L:  Really?
R:  She said they -- they just love the phone book.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, they would just like rip the papers out and chew 'em up.
L:  I wonder if all pigmy goats like phone books or just those two --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- like tasted it one day and they're like I love this and they just keep going for it.
R:  I know.  They just had some like weird idiosyncratic love of like the telephone book paper.  I don't know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I don't know.
R:  I don't know what it is.
L:  Um, this lady at work just got a Miniature chihuahua.
R:  Oh, my God, they're so cute.
L:  Yeah, those are nice.  Those are cute too.  They're just so -- they're like little rats almost though, but they're dogs.
R:  They're really -- they -- they're kinda ratty.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  They really are.  But I think they're cute, but they're -- they're kind of a basket case, you know, like they're really high strung and --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- they tremble all the time, you know?  Like I don't know if the one you've seen at work ...
L:  Yeah, it seems like they're -- her dog is cold all the time or something.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're always like shivering and they can be really yappy and that's ...
L:  You know a lot about pets it sounds like.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I guess I'm just kind of an animal geek.  I don't know.  I've -- I've kinda learned a lot about 'em over the last five or six years.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But I'm -- I'm interested in 'em and, you know, whenever I meet somebody in the neighborhood walking a dog like, you know, we talk about 'em --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- um, just 'cause, you know, I just -- like I said I just became real interested in 'em.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I'm trying to think.  You know, they -- they gave us this whole like -- I guess you couldn't hear it -- but they gave this whole sorta suggested stuff to talk about --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like, um -- and I -- I --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- sorry, I can't remember ...
L:  How much time do you spend with your pets?  We know for sure that one was there.
R:  Oh, yeah, that's right, as much as I possibly can.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I -- my -- my ...
L:  Do you work at all?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And then you come home ...
R:  Oh, yeah, I do.  I work really long hours --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, but, uh, my husband works at home.  So, he's with our pets like during the day --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then I'm with them, you know, in the evening --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and so, yeah, I just -- I love to be with them.
L:  [MN]
R:  But mainly it's just like evenings and weekends I guess.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah. 
R:  And how much time I spend taking care of 'em is, yeah, you know, hard to tell.  I don't know.  Not that much.  I mean, just feeding 'em and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- walking the dog and stuff.
L:  Do you have to take 'em in for shots and ...?
