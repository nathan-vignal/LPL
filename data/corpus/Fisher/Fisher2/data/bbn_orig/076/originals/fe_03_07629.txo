L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  [LAUGH] uh, I'm Merle.
R:  Hi.  I'm Barbara.
L:  How are you?
R:  Fine.  
L:  [LAUGH] um, this is kind of interesting, isn't it?
R:  Yes.  Yeah.
L:  Uh, we're to talk about pets, right?
R:  Okay.
L:  And uh whether we own a pet or -- and what -- what -- what we have and how much time we spend with the pets and --
R:  Yes.  Yes.
L:  And --
R:  So -- so tell me about your pets?
L:  Well, we've always had cats and uh, uh not inside the house.  We keep -- have them outside and uh -- but right at the moment, we don't have any.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But uh -- but we do like to have cats around.  We live on a farm.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And uh so we like to keep them around as much as we can.
R:  Mm.  
L:  How about you?
R:  Uh, let's see.  I have a stray cat that stays outside because um he was never housebroken, you know, when we got him and we realized right away that he was never trot- taught to be housebroken, so he stays outside, but I have two indoor um Jack Russell terrier dogs and a -- a parrot, that stays inside.
L:  Oh.  
R:  The parrot talks.
L:  Really?
R:  Yes. 
L:  Oh, dear.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] uh-huh.  And how much time do I spend with my -- with my pets?  Well, the parrot, um, he um makes a lot of noise when he's alone so he likes to be wherever we are, so he's with us a lot and the dogs, they follow us around wherever we are and I try to take walks with them [LAUGH] you know, depends on the day.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Sometimes I take an hour walk and sometimes I don't walk at all.  And the cat, mm, yeah, I wish we had -- the kids hadn't talked me into adopting the stray [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  But she's okay.
L:  Uh-huh.  Well, we uh -- we don't spend a lot of time with the cats that we -- we've had.  They're kind of -- we kinda use them to -- to keep the mice population down and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- we make sure they're fed and [MN] watered --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and -- but uh --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- we normally don't keep them inside the house.
R:  Right.  So do you neuter 'em or they just keep breeding?
L:  No.  
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  No [LAUGH].
R:  So you have a lot -- 
L:  They -- they kind of come and go as they please --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and so uh sometimes we have uh three or four around here and then sometimes --
R:  Uh-huh?
L:  -- one and sometimes none.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But -- but anyway, uh, that's kinda the way it is on --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- on the farm, I think.
R:  Right.  What kind of farm is it?
L:  It's -- it's um -- it -- what kind?
R:  What kind of farm, mhm?
L:  Well, it's -- we have um grain and livestock.  We have cattle.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Mhm.  Are you a city person?
R:  Uh, suburbs.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I live in a suburb.
L:  Mhm.  Well --
R:  So what else can we say about our pets?  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].  
R:  Uh, like I said, the in -- in -- the inside ones are very -- they're very loved and they're very much a part of the family.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  And uh --
L:  And --
R:  -- the two -- the two little dogs sleep in -- each of them sleeps in my kids' rooms and they kinda each of them belong to one of the boys.
L:  Right.
R:  And the bird sleeps in one of the boys' rooms too 'cause initially that was his bird, but um he's lost interest in it and we've fallen in love with it [LAUGH] but he --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- still sleeps in his room.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  In a big, big cage.
L:  Oh.  Now, have you had him very long, the pa- the parrot?
R:  Yeah, the parrot?  Um, we've had him for about -- I think about a year and a half.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I can't remember if he's a year old or two years old, but um -- and they say that some parents are just not good talkers.  Well, he seems to be a really good talker.
L:  Oh, that's interesting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It'd be neat to have a talking parrot when --
R:  I know.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I taught him to say mommy and so uh --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, and when -- when -- when we leave the room and he's left alone, he starts saying, "Mommy.  Mommy".
L:  Really?
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  One time he -- he uh -- he was back in the bedroom with -- with my son and um the -- and the kids left and forget about him and he hopped down off the cage and walked through the hou- waddles, you know, when he walks, waddled through the house and came in --
L:  Mhm.  
R:  -- through the back --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the back way and he walks in through the door where we're sitting and says, "Hello".  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  Yeah, he sounds like he doesn't know he's a bird.  He thinks he's a person.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah well --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  But most of the time he just says words and I don't think he really associates them yet, but it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  With anything, but it was just kinda funny.
L:  Yeah.
R:  He barks like a dog --
L:  He does?
R:  -- 'cause he hears -- yeah, he -- yeah, they just mimic sounds that they hear, you know, and so he barks --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like a dog, he makes um -- he makes my microwave noise.  He goes, "Beep, beep, beep".  [LAUGH].
L:  Wow.  Did you have to work very hard to teach him or did he just kind of --
R:  He just rep-
L:  -- pick it up on his own?
R:  Well, um, some -- like, some of those things he picked up on his own, but "Mommy", I had -- it took about three weeks for him to say "Mommy" finally.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I just said it -- if he went outside with me, like, when I was um working on projects and stuff and I just kept repeating it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, that's --
R:  Now I'm working on teaching him to count.  I'm saying, "One, two, three".
L:  [LAUGH].  
R:  And he just kind of looks at me, like, "I'm thinking about it", but [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] it's funny.
L:  Yeah.  Well, that's neat
R:  We've -- we've never -- never ha- thought we would ever be [LAUGH] attached to a bird before.
L:  [LAUGH].   Well, I've never had a bird, so I -- I don't know --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- what that would be like.  Do they take quite a bit of ti- care?  I mean, cleaning up and --
R:  He does.  Well yeah, they can become messy. 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Any bird, I suppose, would be, wouldn't they?
R:  They could be.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  My son clips his wings so he doesn't fly.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But he does.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Um, and he only has to clip his wings once every couple months and you know, and -- and -- and actually, you know what's interesting about this bird is that he um -- he's kinda potty trained.  If we put him on the tri stand or a toilet then he'll --
L:  Oh, you're kidding?
R:  -- he'll go in there.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  But then at other times, he just go -- you know, they go frequently so then he just goes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So --
L:  Oh, well, it would be really neat to have a potty trained animal [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, if he was --
L:  -- around.
R:  -- completely potty trained, it would be perfect.
L:  Oh, you're right.  You're right.
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  We got that from um -- from a book or from a website, that we got that idea.  Yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, and you just put him there --
L:  Well, I've -- I've seen a cat do that --
R:  Have you?
L:  -- a -- a Siamese cat used the bathroom facilities, but I've never seen a --
R:  Really?
L:  -- any --
R:  I thought that would be a pretty interesting funny home video, you know?
L:  Yeah, it would be [LAUGH].
R:  Him going on the toilet.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Well, you'll have to think of that.  Maybe you can come up with something.  [LAUGH].
R:  I know.   Send it in and make some money.
L:  Right.  
R:  [LAUGH].  Wow --
L:  Well, how is --
R:  -- ten minutes talking about pets.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I think we have about three more minutes.
L:  Oh, so are you -- I -- good.  I don't have a watch with me so I --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  You're kinda keeping track?
R:  Um --
L:  Well, the kids are enjoying your pets, I imagine, since they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- each kinda have one.
R:  Yeah, they kinda -- they grew up with the -- the dogs, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but you know, they're teenagers now so they -- the dogs are just there, if they're there [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Though I suppose --
R:  And -- and they're not that much time, either.  They're um -- you know, they -- they --
L:  They're busy.
R:  The dog -- yeah, I mean the dogs don't take that much time.  Um --
L:  Oh.  Mhm.
R:  -- at least because we let them out, and they can just go out in the backyard and go potty and then come in when they're done.
L:  Mhm.  So you don't walk your dogs?
R:  I -- I -- they'll go for walks with me wh- because I'm a real -- I like to exercise a lot.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And um so they go -- they love to go for walks --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and so I think I'm -- you know, I mean I -- if that's what I choose to do for exercise that day, they'll -- they go with me.
L:  Mhm.  Well, that --
R:  And I like to walk them in the street.  That way I don't have to bother with clipping their nails, but if I haven't walked them for a while, then their nails need to be clipped and they hate that.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  One especially, she hates it.  She -- she starts howling like a --
L:  Oh, dear.
R:  Sounds like a child, you know?  She just doesn't like [LAUGH] doesn't like her nails clipped --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  She goes [NOISE] you know, and the neighbors must think I'm torturing her.
L:  Oh, dear.
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  She's a real baby, I guess. 
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH].  So --
L:  Well, I think if I ever had a animal in the house, I think I'd like to try a pug.  I -- I don't know too much about them, but I always kind of thought they were cute.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Cute dog.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And small and not -- not a lot of hair so you --
R:  Right.
L:  -- don't have to --
R:  Right.
L:  -- have hair all over everything.
R:  I know.  Yeah.  One of mine seems to be shedding a lot.  I took her outside and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I took the hair clippers, you know --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- like you give a kid -- a boy a haircut?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I took her outside and I clipped --
L:  Really gave her a --
R:  -- clipped her.
L:  -- haircut, huh?
R:  Yeah.  Well, I think I should of gone shorter, but I did cut off a ha- you know, half the length of her hair.
L:  Mhm.
R:  She -- she looks -- it looks really cute, but um, uh, I guess there is a decrease in the shedding this time of year, but boy, I have wood floors and it just really shows up.
L:  Oh, I bet.  Mm.
R:  And um --
L:  I bet.  One of the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- drawbacks [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I think next time I might -- we -- we wanted a poodle.
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so I heard they didn't shed.
L:  Mm.  I don't know about that.  
R:  And they were really smart.  I wanted smart an -- and -- oh, well.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  But they're sweet.  We -- you know, oh well, I just get one of those Swifters and I just, you know, go round real quick.  It takes about a minute or two.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But it --
