L:  Hi, I'm Jessica.
R:  Hi, my name is Mack.
L:  Hi, Mack.
R:  How are you, Jessica?
L:  Staying alive.  How 'bout you?
R:  Ah, I'm not too bad.  Where -- where are you today?
L:  I'm in California.
R:  California, huh?
L:  Yeah, where are you?
R:  [LIPSMACK] I'm in, um, [LIPSMACK] Minneapolis, Minnesota.
L:  Oh, my. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Is it hot?  [LAUGH]
R:  It's actually, you know, people -- people have a, um -- [LIPSMACK] I feel like people have a misconception about Minnesota.
L:  Huh.
R:  And they think that there's -- we have like snow year round but actually, no, it's pretty hot today.  It's probably -- it was in the eighties.
L:  I actually wasn't thinking snow as much as like cold, hot, cold, hot.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  No, that's a -- that's a --
L:  Another misnomer?
R:  That's actually a -- a pretty fair assumption.
L:  Oh.
R:  Because it's -- it's Minnesota and Minneapolis, in particular, is located in a really, really odd position on the -- where the jet stream comes down.  You know what I'm saying?
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
R:  So, like we get these bursts of cold air and then we get bursts of warm air and it's kind of -- I mean, we're right -- we're right in the middle, like on the forty fifth parallel.  It's hard to explain.
L:  Okay.
R:  I'm no meteorologist or anything so ...
L:  [LAUGH] But you're staying there in Minnesota.
R:  Yeah, I'm -- I'm, uh -- I'm hanging in there.
L:  Good.
R:  I got my birthday coming up in a week or so, so ...
L:  All right
R:  [LIPSMACK] That's exciting.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  All right.  What do you, um, find is important in a life partner?
R:  Life partners.  [LIPSMACK] Um [LIPSMACK] I think it would be somebody that shares the same values as [NOISE] -- as you.  You know what I mean?
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  Like somebody -- not neces- -- I don't think you necessarily have to have everything in common.  You just [inaudible] --
L:  But ethics?
R:  -- you just have to -- not necessarily even ethics.  Maybe you just have to kinda have the same, um [LIPSMACK] -- the same, like, [SIGH] way of viewing life because --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- people have -- people kind of have their own -- their own theories, you know, or their own, um, ideas of how to approach life, you know and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I think that that- that's the best way -- that's -- that's the best thing about a life partner.  Do you --
L:  I see what you're saying.
R:  -- actually have a life partner, Jessica?
L:  I do not.
R:  I don't either.
L:  Yeah.  I was thinking ethics, um, myself.  'Cause it seems to me like with ethics you -- you kind of [MN] base a lot of the more important decisions on your ethics.
R:  What do you mean by ethics exactly?  Like, [LIPSMACK] do you mean just like their morals in general?
L:  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK] Just sort of, um ...
R:  For example?
L:  Well, um, [LIPSMACK] how you treat other people, um, you know, your regard for other people mostly.  Other people and the land and things like that.  Just sort of your sensitivity to the needs of other people beyond yourself because you end up making decisions, you know, your regard for -- especially for your own partner.  If your ethics aren't so great, then -- then there's lying and there's, you know, less good treatment.
R:  Right.
L:  So ...
R:  Well, have you been involved in situations like that where --
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah?
L:  You mean, in -- in -- with someone who didn't have good ethics?
R:  Well, for [MN] um -- not necessarily good ethics but somebody who didn't --
L:  [LAUGH] Any ethics.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- who didn't have your ethics.
L:  Oh, yeah.  In fact, my closest friend is a man who -- we -- we match ethically perfectly and it just makes for a fabulous relationship.
R:  Right.
L:  It really does.  It's -- it just makes us really happy to spend time together.
R:  But it's only a friendship?  Is that what you're saying?
L:  Right.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.
L:  So ...
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, ethics.
L:  [LIPSMACK] So, values?  I don't know how you'd compare values to ethics but ...
R:  I think it's -- I think it's, you know --
L:  It's similar.
R:  -- along similar lines.  I just think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean -- o- -- there's -- obviously there's more than one aspect to having quote a life partner, you know.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Like there's more -- like there's more --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- things and y- there's not like one definitive answer I would say.
L:  Yeah, mhm.
R:  That says, "Oh, this person's good, this person's bad" but, [SIGH] yeah, I don't know.  Um ...
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Have you ever thought that you found your life partner and --
L:  Oh, sure.
R:  -- then it turned out --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and then it turned out that the life partner -- 
L:  Had different ethics.  
R:  -- like you -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- like you wanted to [MN] -- you wanted to -- that person to be your life partner and that person didn't wanna be your life partner anymore?
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I have.  How about you?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Kinda disappointing.
L:  It is and then you try and make it happen and it doesn't.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, right.  Well, I'm like -- h- I have that right now, you know, like --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, 'cause this girl, whatever, I don't know, she just -- she -- like we dated for a year or whatever and then she just --
L:  Flaked out or ...?
R:  -- just broke up with me out of n- -- well, it's -- it's -- the circumstances are difficult to explain.
L:  Hm.
R:  'Cause it -- it's -- it's hard to explain but in any case, I was out of town -- I was in -- I was overseas for a while and I came back and like the day I came back --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- she is like [LIPSMACK] "Ah, you know, things -- things are different" or something like that.  It just --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- it really -- but now -- but see here's the really frustrating thing is now we -- we still hang out like once or twice a week.
L:  Oh, and that bothers you?
R:  It doesn't bother me.  It's just --
L:  It's weird?
R:  [LIPSMACK] It's weird 'cause I feel like I can't be myself because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- she -- I have a hard time being able to say things --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- without giving off the implication that I'm --
L:  You're trying to --
R:  -- try- -- that I'm suggesting that I wanna get back together.  And she knows that that's what I want.  And she knows that, sure, she's told me very clearly that that's not what she wants --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it's -- I have a hard time reading her because she's -- she's said that, "I don't wanna a relationship right now and I feel like you and I aren't compatible" or something like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then sh- but then the way that she said, "I don't wanna a relationship --" or she said, "I don't want a relationship with anybody."
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, it's like, I don't know, I d- -- I couldn't tell if she meant that she didn't wanna relationship with, I mean, absolutely anybody and -- but maybe it wasn't necessarily my problem, it was just that she -- she didn't wanna have a commitment at the moment or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it was just confusing but, you know, she's young.  We're both young.  I'm only -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm twenty one.  You know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- she's like twenty, twenty one or something.  How old --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- are you, Jessica?
L:  I'm thirty seven.
R:  Thirty seven, huh?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  What's that like?
L:  It's great.  [SIGH] Because you no longer do things to impress other people or --
R:  You learn from your mistakes. 
L:  Well, you definitely don't -- do that too but after a while, you sort of give up trying to change yourself to fit the bill for somebody else.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, you just realize, "Okay, this is me" you know.  At the end of the --
R:  Right.
L:  -- day, this is me and like it or lump it, this is what I'm gonna --
R:  Do you --
L:  -- be like.
R:  -- do you remember what it was like to be twenty one?
L:  [MN] My twenties were pretty fabulous.  They were.  I mean, I had a great time but I can tell you, it was like in and out of relationships constantly.
R:  Right.
L:  And some of them felt really dramatic and, um, you know.  Some of them felt like it.  
R:  [SIGH]
L:  But, you know, I can tell you you'll be vastly changed when you're my age.
R:  Thirty seven.  Yeah, I can imagine so.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, so, um, but you know, it's -- it's real to you at any age, I think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so ...
R:  Well, [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] yeah, but it's -- I think the -- I think the frustration stems from [NOISE] being so sure of yourself that this is the person and -- and knowing so, you know -- being so, uh --
L:  Surely.
R:  -- adamant about, "Hey, you know, this is like -- this person fits me perfectly" and like finally becoming conscious of that and realising, "Hey, you know, this is so great" whatever --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then all of a sudden, um, no, not any more, whatever.
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  It's really -- and especially when you think that the other person feels the same way or that the other person at one time actually --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- did feel the same way and you -- you have to ask yourself, "What changed?"  You know.  What -- was it may fault?  Was it something that she did?  Or was it something that --
L:  When you're --
R:  -- he did?
L:  -- in your twenties, honestly, especially -- well, for both genders --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you change your mind constantly.
R:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK]
L:  You don't have a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It -- I think it's just evolutionary.  I think it's like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you, um -- I don't think you're really supposed --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to necessarily everyone's supposed to find the one --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- in their twenties.  I think -- you know, it's entirely possible that you can find the one in your twenties but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'm not convinced that everyone is that way and some people may me- -- may be mature in many, many ways and in the end they don't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, there's just not ready for the big, you know, a big --
