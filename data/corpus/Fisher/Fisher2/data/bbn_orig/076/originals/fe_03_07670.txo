L:  Hello
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, I'm Alan.
L:  Oh, my name's Gabby.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- this is the first time I'm doing this, so --
R:  Same here.
L:  -- uh, I don't know what to tell you, talk about pets.
R:  All right.  I have a cat.
L:   You have a cat.  What's your cat's name?
R:  Uh, it's actually called Toonces.  She's --
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, no. [LAUGH]
R:  You know who Toonces is?
L:  [MN]
R:  Toonces is the driving cat on -- on Saturday Night Live, they have a sketch --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, it be -- well, I'm -- I'm fifty, so -- I just turned fifty, so, uh, this'd be from --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- many years ago.
L:  Oh.
R:  But, uh, what kind of animal do you --
L:  How -- how -- well, I have a -- a strange animal.  Have you ever heard of a Sugar Glider?
R:  A what?
L:  A Sugar Glider.
R:  A Sugar Glider?
L:  Yes.
R:  No.
L:  They're, um -- they're kind of like flying squirrels but not really --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- um, they're a marsupial, they -- they look like --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- do you know what I'm talking about?
R:  Okay, yeah.
L:  Um, they -- they look like -- the face looks like a really, really cute raccoon, but not a raccoon because raccoons are -- are vicious, um --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- Sugar Gliders are -- uh, the reason n- -- that I learnt about Sugar Gliders is one time I was watching, um, [MN] uh, s- uh, Sallie Jessie Raphael --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and there was this guy that was paralysed and, um, from, like, the neck down --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and I had, uh, seen that and then he -- they got him a pet to kind of get him, you know, um, to feel the animal a- across his body, but, you know, since he was paralysed he couldn't --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and then, all of a sudden, he started moving his neck, so it was like a miracle, um, because of this pet and when I saw it, oh, it was so cute, I said, you know, they -- they have to be real lovable --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and they're -- they're a pocket pet, you could just take 'em everywhere --
R:  How big is the pet?
L:  Um, it- it's about, you know, the size of your palm --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- they're tiny -- they're -- they're so [MN] -- I don't know, my pet's important to me, um, yeah, it -- it -- he's -- he has, like, human characteristics and he -- he cops an attitude sometimes when he doesn't like what I feed him [LAUGH], you know?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  He's -- he's adorable.  Um, he -- he --
R:  So, how many people do you know have one?
L:  Um, not that many.  I actually, you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I've been wanting one for a long time but they're really expensive --
R:  Oh, they are?
L:  -- they're, like, about four hundred, yeah, I know --
R:  [MN] What do you w- --
L:  -- well, they're expensive for me. [LAUGH]
R:  -- what do you feed it?
L:  Uh, you feed it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you have to feed it, um, fresh fruit, you have to cut up all of the -- the fresh fruit every night or Sugar Glider, uh, nutrition stuff --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you -- you mix it with gatorade and yogurt, [MN] um --
R:  So, it has -- obviously then it eats lots of sugar.
L:  Yeah, it has a high tolerance of sugar.
R:  Is -- is that where the word comes from?
L:  Yes, sir,
R:  Hm.
L:  Yes, most definitely.  I love this animal though.
R:  I wonder if they could get diabetes.
L:  [MN] [LAUGH] I wonder --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [inaudible].  I can see where you get your Saturday Night Live [MN] --
R:  Very -- very good, very good that --
L:  I know. [LAUGH]
R:  -- you picked up on that.  Yeah, the Toonces sketch was, uh, oh jeeze, many years ago.  Sometimes they'll have it on replay, but [SIGH] it was the driving cat they had a actual real cat, like, would sit in the car, you know, you know, cut out of a car, they would have, like, something like Victoria Jackson or Marty Short or somebody --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and Steve Martin or somebody -- anyway, it would just -- it would drive and it would have, uh, you know, fake paws on the, uh, steering wheel --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- but I mean, but a real cat behind the steering wheel, uh, so it would make it look like it was really driving, you know, and --
L:  Funny.
R:  -- [SIGH] and then, um, they were, like, so happy about, "See, I have a driving cat", and then it would always go over the cliff, they'd show a -- a pict- --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- they would show a picture of, like, a nineteen forties car going over a cliff from some movie --
L:  And ty- typical Saturday Night Live.
R:  -- they'd always did that, so that -- it was a running joke and it would, uh -- but my cat has the, uh, facial features of that.  But anyway --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I've had her for about eight years or nine years --
L:  Eight years?
R:  -- and, uh, um --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- like, my father, one time, asked me what -- what's the name of the cat, and I said, "Toonces" and he's like, "What?" and I'm like, "Oh wait, uh, Mickey, Mickey" -- that'll be fine.
L:  Oh.
R:  I just made up another name, but the people who know me know what -- know who Toonces is, 'cause then [SIGH] every once in a while we'll have a, uh, you know, and since Saturday Night's been on for twenty five years [SIGH] --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- they'll have, you know, replays of -- of --
L:  Too funny.
R:  -- shows, and also there'll be Toonces the driving cat, so --
L:  Too funny.
R:  -- yeah.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] they -- they do a lot of puns with those animals now, like, you know, just -- there's so many ways that they -- they try and make it human, like, how you said, using the fake paws and then --
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah --
R:  That's ba- --
L:  -- you know, how the -- the photographer that dresses up wigmerang[?] dogs and puts them in a book?  The one that dresses them up like, you know -- what -- those, uh -- hunting dogs -- those gray dogs?
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  How does he even think of an idea like that where he would make a --
R:  Right.
L:  -- dollar -- one dollar --
R:  So, you want --
L:  -- on that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I mean, I don't -- you know, that's crazy, I wish I was the brilliance behind it all, [LAUGH] or -- or your cat, you know, tha- -- the sketch, oh man, [NOISE] it's just, um -- 'cause some people, you know -- like one of the things I was just watching on CNN is there's this dog spa, where, uh, pet owners can take their dogs --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and it's, like -- yeah --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- it's for the dogs, like their whole vacation revolves around their dogs, where --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, the dogs get the treatments, they get to --
R:  Right.
L:  -- go into the -- the pond, all kinds of crazy stuff --
R:  What -- 
L:  -- it's not --
R:  -- and a- and a- and now they massages too. [LAUGH]
L:  -- oh, nice, nice.
R:  You know, or talked to or -- or there's pet psychology, there's pet psychics, they can tell --
L:  Oh, please.
R:  -- about their pasts or their whatever.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, a friend of mine actually -- there's a pet cemetery where they pay hundreds of dollars to -- rather than just, you know, there's lots of ways to take care of a -- animal --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when they're not there anymore, but --
L:  Uh, try- trying to sound politically correct, or, you know --
R:  Right, but --
L:  -- emotionally correct.
R:  -- you know.
L:  Wow.
R:  I know.
L:  And what does your friend do?
R:  Well, now, actually, uh, well he works in the health field but, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he's a very macho guy, but, you know, th- th- their animals mean a lot to them, sometimes, uh --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- as much as a human, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  It -- yeah --
R:  In that way, I'm -- I'm happy --
L:  -- I -- I feel the same way.
R:  --you know, I mean, and, uh, I'm -- I'm really pleased that humans treat animals nowadays as much, uh, respect as they do, uh, humans, um --
L:  Yeah, some pet owners --
R:  -- and yet, at -- at the same time, there's still people that, uh, treat 'em so badly too, you know, so -- but --
L:  Yeah, I mean -- and then, you know, the people that -- that treat animals well, they treat people well, you know, so, I mean, it has to begin with treating people -- I think that's important too --
R:  Right --
L:  -- um, you know --
R:  -- some -- some animals eat better than humans do, uh --
L:  I know.
R:  -- you know, my cat sometimes'll be whining about -- she only gets dry food --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- dry food and water and a little bit of milk, I mean, that's all she's had for all these years, that's probably why she's lived so well, 'cause she --
L:  She didn't?
R:  -- never gets table scraps or stuff like that.
L:  That's true, you know, my, um, uh -- I had a pet named Hershey, and I --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- had to give him away before, um, you know, when I left for college it stayed with my parents and now Hershey, I mean, absolutely loves my parents --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he -- he sleeps on the, you know -- the edge of the bed, if anything makes a noise he gets real protective and that's the thing -- they won't give him, um, food scraps --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and Hershey, oh my goodness, he could -- you could put a plate in front of him and tell him, "Okay, G.O., G.O." and then he'd finally go when you said, "Go".  He -- you could tell him all kinds of things, like, that rhyme with go, he won't do it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- he won't go to the food, it's so cute.  I don't know why we do these, ridiculous, um, you know, antics to try and get animals to stop eating their food, how rude.  But, um -- but, I don't know, Hershey's h- h- he's therapeutical, I think, that since we all moved out, you know, at least my parents have something, you know, just t- to feed and to make them feel like parents still --
R:  There is that.
L:  -- even though they don't have to take the burden of -- of -- of us asking them for, you know, all kinds of things, "Mom, give me dinner", you know.
R:  Um, this is Nashville, by the way.
L:  Oh, are you Na- -- I'm calling from Dallas.
R:  Okay, well --
L:  [NOISE] Wow.
R:  -- we just had a PBS special on the other day on, uh, animal consciousness, uh, and on animal personalities, on animal intelligence and, [SIGH] you know, when you look at things like porpoises or chimpanzees or whatever and, [SIGH] I mean, the -- especially the people who study them for years and you look into their eyes and you look into their personalities and things that they can learn and, you know, it's like -- how can people be so cruel to 'em, you know --
L:  Yeah, oh yeah.
R:  -- like bounty hunters and things --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and sometimes, like you'd almost protect 'em with your life, you know, if somebody tried to come after 'em or something --
L:  It's pretty crazy -- [SIGH] and it's --
R:  -- and even -- even the biggest, like, stuff, like, elephants or even the things that you'd be -- you would think, like, [SIGH] are -- are just big old mean things are really just --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- wh- -- you know, when -- when you see 'em with their little babies, they're just so gentle with them.
L:  Oh, I know, I know.
R:  You know, or, like, uh -- like the gorillas, like, huge gorillas, but then when they're with their little babies that only weigh a few pounds or something, they're --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so gentle with them, they know --
L:  Yes, they are.
R:  -- how to be gentle, even with, uh, when they put them in their mouth or something --
L:  Mhm --
R:  -- have you ever seen a panda?
L:  -- I remember seeing a special on that --
R:  You --
L:  -- no, I remember --
R:  -- ever seen a panda, that -- the panda's babies are only, like, uh, m- maybe a pound or a couple of p- -- I don't know how much, but they're little pink things --
L:  -- I bet you they look like rats --
R:  -- yeah.
L:  -- like, real tiny, huh?
R:  And they just hold them, like, um, but they -- they know how to be gentle with them, uh --
L:  That's amazing.
R:  -- no matter how --
L:  I remember seeing a special on -- on gorillas, you kn- -- have you ever heard of Coco?
R:  Right, right.
L:  The one that does the sign language with humans?
R:  Right, right.
L:  That's crazy.  That, to me, was absurd until I actually saw the special.  It was --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I mean, the -- the animal, Coco, which is this gorilla thing --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I mean, it was growing up with -- with, uh, the scientist that was taking care of him --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they would start, like, not drawing pictures, but grabbing things to symbolize other things, like, he would grab a lettuce to symbolize he wants to eat or something, whatever.  Well, one time he grabbed one of the dolls and --
