R:  Mhm.
L:  All righty.  Well, I guess we're supposed to talk about professional sports on TV.

L:  Uh, well, let's see.  I don't have too much time for watching sports on TV.
R:  Mhm
L:  I got four kids so ...
R:  Wow!  Uh-huh.
L:  But, um, I -- I think I probably like football more than anything else.
R:  Yeah.  Monday night football is probably the only thing I really watch.
L:  Monday night football, okay.
R:  Yeah, and, like, Thursday night.
L:   Oh, there's -- okay.
R:  [inaudible] yeah.  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, um, so mainly pro football?
R:  Yeah, pretty much.  Well, actually my, uh, dad went to Stanford.  He was a gr- graduate of Stanford so sometimes I actually go to some Stanford games.
L:  Yo- you're dad was what?
R:  He's a -- he's a graduate of Stanford.
L:  Oh, Stan- okay.
R:  Yeah.  So, and we sometimes go to their college football games.
L:  Okay.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, okay, we have our Detroit Lions here, you know, our [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ha- uh, won t- what, uh, five games in the last two years so ...
R:  Yeah, I don't know, yeah.
L:  But, uh, you know, we like f- -- we like our Lions even though they lose so much.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] But that's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- about the -- I think that's about the only sport I really watch on TV these days.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  When I was younger I used to watch more.  I had more time. I liked to --
R: Yeah.
L:  -- just watch baseball more and ...
R:  Actually I prefer more, like, the world extreme sports and stuff too.
L:  More what? 
R:  World extreme sports.  Kinda like, uh, I don't know, just, uh, skate boarding or Olympics sports.
L:  Okay.
R:  Like the X. games too and stuff.  
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  Like, especially when they came -- they came --
L:  H- how old are you?
R:  -- to San-  -- I'm sixteen.
L:  How old?  Sixteen?
R:  Sixteen.
L:  Oh, okay.  All [LAUGH] right.
R:  [MN] 
L:  Okay more stuff that, you know, you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- guys your age won't do even, okay.
R:  Mhm.
L:  All right, um [PAUSE] [LIPSMACK] baseball, you ever watch baseball on TV?
R:  No.  Not really at all actually.  I'm --
L:  So, yeah --
R:  -- [several inaudible words] like baseball's too -- too -- too slow for me.
L:  Yeah.  Well that's the way that's, yeah.  Years ago, you know, that was the thing to watch, was baseball.
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.
L:  They used to have the s- -- every Saturday the game of the week and that was real popular.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But now it's -- people aren't into baseball as much any more.
R:  Yeah.  [several inaudible words] why.
L:  With, uh, yeah, football's more taken over than anything else too.  Even golf on TV.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] uh, let's see.  But [PAUSE] what else on TV sports, um, wrestling, do you watch that?
R:  No, I don't watch wrestling.
L:  No.  It's a -- just a come on anyway.
R:  Way to fake for me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I don't deal with that, yeah. 
L:  Yeah.  Un --
R:  I just the -- I know there's a lot of li- -- lot of little kids like to watch wrestling though.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Like, you know, ten and under or something are right into it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- trying to play around and pretend they're --
L:  Our foster son --
R:  Exactly. 
L:  -- when he lived with his parents used to watch a lot.  We -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we don't let him even.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  So, [LIPSMACK] golf is okay sometimes on TV.  I never --
R:  Yeah, it's not so bad sometimes.  
L:  -- used to watch it when I was younger.
R:  Sometimes it's ... mhm.
L:  What?
R:  Yeah, sometimes it's not that bad actually.  I find myself watching it sometimes on occasions.
L:  Yeah.  Um, then we have, you know, we have basketball and soccer professional teams. I'll only watch them --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- on TV if it's, like, in the finals.  Like, if there's an NBA finals --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or Stanley Cup.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Other than that I don't bother.
R:  Yeah, actually when -- when soccer's on TV, I do watch that.
L:  Soccer?  Okay.
R:  Yeah, I mean, I used to play so- -- I don't play soccer any more.  I used to play soccer but I don't know, I just -- [PAUSE] it just always seems like one of the most interesting sports.
L:  Okay.
R:  [several inaudible words].  It is really always really fast paced and stuff.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, [LIPSMACK] [PAUSE] Oh, let's see, what other sports.  Um, I don't r- -- what else are we supposed to talk about?  Just that professional sports on TV?
R:  Professional sports on TV.  I rather like hockey.  Do you watch hockey?
L:  No.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Never got -- never got into hockey.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Never -- 
R:  Yeah, kinda same here. 
L:  -- even though, you know, we have our Detroit Redwings here but I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- unless they're in the Stanley Cup finals, I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- even then I barely watch it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Never got into that sport.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um [PAUSE] you know, after football, I really don't watch much.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Even then I don't even watch too much.  I don't watch college football.  That's, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Y- you know, I got four kids, it's --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- [LAUGH] other things to do.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Actually I -- I prefer college football over, uh, pro football as, you know, they're -- they -- it seems more interesting because they'll --
L:  I -- I can barely hear you, Loren.
R:  -- do a little more wild play and stuff --
L:  Loren, I can bar- barely hear you.
R:  Oh, I'm sorry.  Um, I prefer college football over, like, the NFL --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- just because, you know, they just -- college it seems that they are, um, are willing to, you know, do more wild plays -- a little more exciting than, you know.  I mean, the NFL are just too -- yeah well, all about -- they're concerned about wining and -- or college is too I guess.   But you see a little more interesting plays and stuff that don't happen in the -- in the NFL.
L:  Uh-huh.   More like double ren[?] reverse play college and stuff.
R:  Yeah, and, like, helm[?] ar- -- more helm areas and just stuff like that.
L:  More what?
R:  Helm areas and, uh, like, you know, flea suckers and --
L:  Yeah.  Oh yeah.
R:  -- laterals and stuff.
L:  Right.
R:  Like that type.
L:  Okay.  [PAUSE] Yeah.  [PAUSE] And, uh, [PAUSE] [LIPSMACK] but I don't know, what else?  Sports on TV, um [LIPSMACK] ...
R:  Mm.  I don't know.  Mm.
L:  Hm.  [PAUSE] Don't know what to say.  Bowling.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Bowling   Yeah.  I don't know, I wouldn't -- 
L:  Not much there.
R:  -- call that interesting to me.  'Cause I mean, you watch it, almost every other whatever bowl is a -- is a strike.  So, I don't know how interesting that is.
L:  I -- I ca- -- what's that?
R:  Like almost every other, uh, sh- -- bowl into the -- bowl into the throw is a strike.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So, it's really not that interesting, I mean, it's like a --
L:  They're good.
R:  -- strike or it's speared.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Not a lot of excitement to it I don't think, for me that is.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Tennis is boring, on sports, on TV.
R:  Yeah.  I never really cared for tennis too much.
L:  They say basketball was really made for TV, just the way f- --
R:  Sorry?
L:  They say that basketball was a sport that was made for TV almost.
R:  Why's that?
L:  I don't know, just 'cause it's, you know, in a smaller area, the court. and they can really get --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- in close on all the players.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, versus --
R:  Like, football has a lot of --
L:  Ho- --
R:  -- uh, down time just waiting for team plays.
L:  What?  I -- I can't hear you.  What?
R:  Football; lotta down time waiting in between plays and stuff.
L:  That's true.
R:  So, that's always --
L:  Hockey; it's sometimes hard to follow the puck.
R:  Yeah, it is.  Lot of, uh, like, TV networks, they've used like this little, uh -- I don't know what they're -- but they -- they're like lights behind the puck that lights up the area like a blue or something red.
L:  Yeah.  Put some -- 
R:  Have you seen those?
L:  -- some -- yeah, they used to glow or something.  Just r- --
R:  Yeah, exactly.  And kinda like a football they use like that yellow line now on the screen to mark the first line. 
L:  Oh, yeah, right.  For the scrimmage line.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, that's right, hockey used to have that where the puck would glow just y- -- I think you'd just see it on TV.
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It makes it a little easier to follow.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  [LIPSMACK] Um, but [LIPSMACK] [PAUSE] auto racing?  That's -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I know that's the most popular sport now but I never --
R:  Well --
L:  -- got into that either.
R:  I like more, uh, I don't like -- I like F one racing or, like Le Mans and stuff but Nascars don't appeal to me.  
L:  That -- 
R:  Just driving in circles or a big oval is kinda boring.  I don't know.
L:  No.  Do you watch that on TV?  Auto racing?
R:  No, I don't watch -- what, sorry?
L:  You do -- do you watch it n TV, auto racing?
R:  Like Nascar?  Well, it's rarely ever.  But I don't like -- like F one or Le Mans like that are rarely ever on.  You know, but --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- more races, like, things in Europe a little more interesting.  If you ever get something like that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but just, like, Nascar or like Indy five hundreds, I don't know, it's not interesting to me.
L:  Mhm.  Mm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, I don't know what more I could say about sports on TV, um --
R:  Yeah, I mean, I don't know really -- both really watch --
L:  They've got, like, cable TV of course now they have the all sports channel or your ESPN but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I never watch those.  Do you?
R:  Yeah, oh, I watch ESPN for a minute, I don't know.  But ususally it's, um, plotted[?].  I watch mostly sports center.
L:  Okay.
R:  It's just like a, it's just like a, you know, general information stuff, and highlights and stuff.  But [PAUSE] been a lot of baseball on recently and I don't -- so, I don't care for it.  But I also -- I also -- I also get ESPN two.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That has a little more extreme things I was talking about.  Kind of like BMX biking or snowboarding, stuff like that.
L:  Okay.  
R:  It's a litte more interesting.
L:  You're -- you're kind of stuff?
R:  Mm, exactly.  More geared towards, you know, younger people.
L:  Okay.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, even if sat down, have nothing to do, I'll turn on TV, I -- I don't think I'd watch a sporting event.  I'd rather watch the history channel --
R:  Really.  Mhm.
L:  -- Discovery channel or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or some old movie I've seen before even. I, yeah --
R:  Really.
L:  I'm just not into watching sports any more.  I'm not sure why.
R:  Mm.
L:  Something, like I don't read the funny papers, the comics in the newspaper any more.
R:  Yeah, well, I don't read the newspaper at all really.  Oh, like, I should.  And when I do read it, I find it interesting, but I really never make time to do that much.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  But I -- I don't know what it has to do with sports, but it's something I just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- kinda quit doing for some reason.  
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  And not into watching sports on TV.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Unless it's a prime event, you know, like, we always have a Super Bowl party --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- with people over.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um [PAUSE] even then I don't watch much of it because I'm ususally with people and let's talk about them and then I --
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.
L:  -- find out later what happened [LAUGH] in the game.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  But, yeah, I don't watch much -- vir- --
