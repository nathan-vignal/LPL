R:  Hi, I'm Lori.
L:  Hi, Lori, my name is Michael.  Good morning, how are you?
R:  Fine, how are you?
L:  Fine, thanks.  Where are you located this morning?
R:  I'm in Huntsville, Alabama.
L:  Huntsville, Alabama --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- how cool, I'm in Los Angeles.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Good morning.
R:  Morning.
L:  Go Crimson Tide.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  What's the most important thing in a life partner to you, Lori?
R:  Well, [LIPSMACK] they have to be, um, Christian --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- or have some type of base -- base belief like mine.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, they [SIGH] have to, um, have a -- a decent job, which is not everything, but it's -- it's good part of [LAUGH] things, um -- oh, man, well, it's -- um, let's see.  Most importantly, is -- is their faith, 'cause everything else will fall in place.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, how about yourself?
L:  [SIGH] Most important thing to me, Lori, is being able to sit down and talk --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, you can have sex for a while --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and you can, uh, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- buy things for each other and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but if you can't sit down and say, "Hey, what did you do today?" you know, "What are your problems?" you know, and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- honestly communicate, you know, from the heart, that's -- for me that's number one.
R:  Okay.
L:  Uh, looks are important also, I'm not going to lie to you --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I mean, I need to have some type of physical attraction, but --
R:  Right, that's true, okay.
L:  -- but, for me, um, I'm an in shape guy, I -- I don't seem to care, I don't mind if a girl's three hundred pounds, really, I mean --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- if she's just, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- really sweet and kind, that's the most important thing.
R:  Okay.
L:  Are you in a relationship right now?
R:  Yes, I'm married, yeah.  Are you?
L:  No, no, I'm --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- I'm single -- looking --
R:  Hah.
L:  -- you know. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay. [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  Um --
R:  Mm.
L:  What else is -- what else is, like, really important to you in, like, a relationship, besides faith?  I mean, does it --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- have to be appearance, looks, money, uh ...
R:  Well, okay, um, appearance is a big thing, [MN] I mean, but it's not, like, uh, you know, I can overlook the appearance, um, I have to be able to h- -- you know, be able to talk to -- you have th- things in common wi- with you.  Um, you have to be able to hold a -- a decent conversation --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, er, um, [MN] [LAUGH] let's see, um --
L:  I agree with you, I -- I agree with you, I mean --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you have to ha- --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you have to -- you have to have some physical attraction, you have to be able to talk --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- with each other and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- also the other person can't be, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so lazy that, I mean, if they don't have to workout, but, I mean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, they have to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- take some pride in their physical appearance --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they have to -- you have to have some fiscal responsibility, I don't want them coming to me all the time and saying, you know, "By the way, can y- -- you know, I have no money, I don't have a job, uh --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know c- c- -- I understand that money issues are a big, you know --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- problem in relationships.
R:  -- in today's society, yes, it is.
L:  So, that's -- that's all, so it -- it's important, it's not as important as communication, but it's important that they have their own sense of identity and are not wholly responsible, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for me to give them their identity.
R:  Right, mhm.
L:  Do you, um -- do you have children?
R:  Yes, I have one son, he's fourteen months.
L:  Oh, that's -- that must b- -- congratulations.
R:  Thank you.
L:  Well, that must be important for, like, your husband and you, I mean, a child now --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- completely changes the relationship --
R:  Right.
L:  -- 'cause now you have a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- beautiful thing that's half of you and half of him --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- uh, uh, this -- this beautiful creature, um --
R:  Yeah, it's definitely brought us closer, I can tell you that much. [LAUGH]
L:  -- and so it's important that, y- -- I guess, you know, [MN] they -- I guess, you and your husband say, "Okay, you go to this school, or you buy these type of clothes, or you're going to eat this --"
R:  Right.
L:  "-- or I'm going to raise you a Christian, I don- -- I'm going to raise you Jewish", you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that happens sometimes too --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, that's, uh, I guess, important too --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in a relationship.
R:  Yeah, we're, you know -- that we are equally yoked so that we can raise him right, you know, the -- in the way both of us would have him to be raised, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's -- it's not, like, one parent is [SIGH] what, catholic and the other one is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [NOISE] uh, atheist --
L:  [MN] Uh-huh.
R:  -- you -- you -- you -- you -- you know, it's one religion --
L:  That's excellent.
R:  -- that we raise him, you know?
L:  Well, a lot of people, they don't -- they don't have that, so they're not that fortunate, they fall in --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- love with because of whatever and they're --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- unequally yoked --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but they still try to get -- make it work.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Um, [NOISE] but children really, uh, they're -- oh my goodness, I mean, there's a l- --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, people hunt people down because of their kids or they can't see their kids in the weekend because they're separated or things like that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I know people like that --
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH] -- so that's important.  What else is important in a --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- in a life partner?
R:  Well, [MN] I say, basically what is important to me --
L:  Uh-huh.  See --
R:  -- what else is important to you?
L:  Well, you know, I [MN] -- I try to -- like, you're from Alabama --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I'm really attracted to that, just because, I don't know, it's very -- the mystique --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- of Alabama, me being in California, so if I, like, really fell in love with you, I would have to say, "Well, what happens if Lori was -- what happens if she was from Phoenix?"  I mean, would I still feel the same way?
R:  Oh.
L:  So, it's y- --
R:  Location? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, ab- absolutely, so, I mean, what's important is to have not so much where the person's from or --
R:  Mhm
L:  -- or their breast size --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- or their body size, 'cause you could lose those to cancer or a mass of things can happen and go wrong --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so, the -- the main thing is the inner -- the inner beauty, um, and I don't like someone who is so boastful, or they have to impress or they're out to [SIGH] -- to be, like, they're -- they're living a television series, you know, they get caught up in that's the reality of the world and people do that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, it's important that the person I get is -- maybe they read, or they -- they have their own identity --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's important.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, let's see. [MN] What else is important thing in a life partner?
R:  Mm.
L:  Um, you mentioned faith --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, there's different levels of faith, uh, different dedom- -- denominations, even the Christian faith, I guess, there's --
R:  Mhm
L:  -- Baptist and there's Lutherans and Pentecostals and, I guess, there's some rift there, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, it's important that you have -- that your husband is the exact denomination as you?
R:  Yes.
L:  So, you guys go to the same church and --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- you believe in l- ...  Is it a big church or a small church?
R:  [MN] It's -- it's, uh -- it's pretty -- it's pretty big, it's growing in membership.  I'm a Seventh Day Adventist.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, um, [LIPSMACK] there is a lot of that around in this area, in Huntsville --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but, um, yeah, we belong to a pretty -- it's pretty big size, it's, like, maybe eight hundred, nine hundred members.
L:  Seventh Day Adventists, that's -- I guess, from mind --
R:  They're [inaudible].
L:  -- there's, like, Ed Hensen and then there's the guy who does the Day Discovery, Mark Findlay --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I guess he's Seventh Day Adventist.
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] Um, wonderful, just -- just beautiful people.
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  Um, don't know whole lot about it, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- beautiful, um, so that's important, I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if you're -- if -- if you met somebody and they were, like, not a Seventh Day Adventist, they were just, like, say, a Baptist, would that cause --
R:  Well, I would -- I would do my best to, you know -- I would introduce them to the -- i- i- it's not like it -- a total, "Okay, well since you're not my religion I'm going to turn you off totally" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know what I'm saying? [SIGH]
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  Um, [SIGH] it all depends --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it -- it just depends on who I get -- if -- if I was single, who I would get with and, um, what -- where their mind is at, wh- -- you know, wh- what they're leading to, but I definitely would not make a serious commitment --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to them until they were -- we -- we were of the same belief.
L:  Right.  Well, you're -- you sound very level headed and then --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and s- -- and -- and bright, 'cause a lot of people don't do that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they let their -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- their -- their bottom half of their bodies --
R:  Oh, yeah, mhm, mhm.
L:  -- talk, you know, they get that -- that -- they get -- they get rolling.
R:  Mhm, because anybody can put a bag over your head and [LAUGH] --
L:  Yes, right, exactly.
R:  -- you know what I'm saying? 
L:  E- exactly.
R:  So, you know, that's --
L:  You know, also, I've had problem in the past is that I'm more of a homebody, I mean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I- I'll go out, but I work f- -- I work full time, even -- two jobs and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I come home sometimes, I really don't want to go out to the night clubs or partying and things like that and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so it's important that I -- I don't know if [MN] your husband and you -- y- y- you like to go out a lot or -- or stay home --
R:  Yeah, I mean, yeah, um, pretty much, we -- we -- we don't go partying or nothing like that, but, you know, [SIGH] we go out to restaurants, we go out visit friends and stuff like that, you know.
L:  My -- been with girls -- girlfriends that, I mean, it- it's, like, five nights a week they need to -- they just need to keep busy.  I don't know if it's a, [LAUGH] you know -- a part of their make up --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or they're just --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- but if I slow down then that's --
R:  [MN] [NOISE] 
L:  -- I've broken up before sometimes because they're just --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- y- -- they just need to be constantly out and about --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, I guess, that's to be, like, equally yoked, you have to have some type of, you know, balance --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- you know, um, so that's important.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, how about education, is education im- --
R:  Yes, it is, yes, very important, I, um, I [MN] graduated from college --
L:  What college did you go to?
R:  Um, Alabama, you know --
L:  Hey --
R:  -- University --
L:  -- congratulations.
R:  -- thank you -- and, um, you know, I'm about to start working on my Masters, so --
L:  [SIGH] Congratulations.
R:  -- yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  I have a Masters too, I got mine from Santa Fe State.
R:  Okay, all right.
L:  Yeah, um --
R:  What did you major in?
L:  I majored in library and information science, so --
R:  Okay, I'm a social worker.
L:  Um, so will you -- with your Masters degree, will you be working for the State of Alabama or for the --
R:  May- maybe --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- but I -- I really want to move to Tennessee.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, in Nashville.
L:  Wow, what --
R:  Because, I -- I mean, I -- I like it.  I really like it.  And H- Huntsville's a little too small.  It's, I mean, it's a nice size and everything, but I like a bigger city and --
L:  Is Huntsville near Tennessee, or is it more --
R:  It's like, an hour and a half, two hours away.
L:  -- uh-huh.
R:  So, it's -- it's not bad at all.  And, of course, I'd be closer -- close to family and friends --
