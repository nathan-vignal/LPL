R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name's Connie.
L:  Hey, Connie, my name is Mike.
R:  Hi, Mike.  Do you have a pet?
L:  Yes, I do.
R:  What do you have?
L:  I have a golden retriever slash something else. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's half golden retriever.  It's -- her, uh, her mom was a pure bred golden retriever, so --
R:  My brother has one of those, half golden retriever and half something else. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, she's a great dog.
R:  And --
L:  Eight years old.
R:  Aw.
L:  So she's ... she's wonderful with -- I have a three year old son so she's wonderful with him.
R:  Now, how did she react when your son came along?
L:  A- -- she had no problems.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, no, it really -- there wasn't any kind of a -- issue there at all really.  I'm s- surprised how well it went.
R:  Yeah.
L:  He's just terrorizing her now.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  My wife's name is Connie.
R:  Oh yeah?  That's kind of neat.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I have a ten year old dalmatian.
L:  A ten year old dalmatian?  Wow, that's old for a dalmatian.
R:  Yeah, well, I'm hoping it'll be even longer, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  She, um, was rather hyper when we got her but I think they usually are.
L:  So how old was she when you got her?
R:  Uh, just a ba- -- she was just a baby, like, six or eight weeks.
L:  Oh, okay, that's about the same with us too then.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I know a lot of people get dalmatians but then return them.
L:  Yeah.  They're kind of -- I heard they're kind of tough.
R:  Um, they're kind of high strung.  But she's worth it.  Now she's just a sweet little dog.  Well, not --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- little, but ...  Yeah, she, um, she was a little jealous, though, when our daughter was born.
L:  Oh.  Well -- so, uh, did you get her at a pound or ...?
R:  No, we got her from a breeder.
L:  From a breeder, okay.
R:  Yeah.  My husband always wanted w- -- a dalmatian and so we got one.
L:  That's fun.
R:  Yeah.
L:  How -- how -- how much does she weigh?
R:  She's, like, seventy pounds.
L:  Seventy pounds?  That's about how much -- Casey's our dog's name.  She weighs about seventy pounds.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  She's heavy.  Big --
R:  But they're just big teddy bears, aren't they?
L:  Yeah, they really are.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But she ... and you could pull on her tail or ... you know, whatever you w- -- you wanted to do to kind of check her disposition and she's fine.
R:  Wow.  That's really good.
L:  And she's got no issues.
R:  Now, is that typical of the breed?
L:  I think so with golden retrievers.  And she was retrieving when she was ... right after we got her.  I could get a tennis ball, I could throw it and she'd go get it and bring it back to me.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  It was incredible.  Because I always wanted a dog that would retrieve.
R:  Uh-huh.  So --
L:  Got her to catch a frisbee and the whole deal.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now, is she an outside dog?
L:  Yeah, outside most of the time.  I bring her in at night.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But some nights she wants to go back outside so ...
R:  Oh.  Now, where you do you live?
L:  Live in Kansas City.
R:  Oh, okay.  Who --
L:  Where are you at?
R:  I'm in Illinois.
L:  Illinois, okay.
R:  Just a small old town, yeah.
L:  Good deal.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Have you done these bef- --
R:  We've been through Kansas City but ...
L:  Yeah, not too far.
R:  No.
L:  We grew up in -- well, I was -- I lived in Glen Ellyn for a while.
R:  Oh, okay.  Up by Chicago?
L:  Yep, by Chicago.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Before we moved.  When I -- I moved when I was, like, eight so, pretty much spent most of my life in Kansas City but ...
R:  I, uh ... so have you --
L:  I don't think we're going to get another dog.  I think we're done with it when -- if some -- you know, when something happens to Casey, we're done.
R:  Do ya?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Too much work, or ...?
L:  Yeah, well, we'd like to have a little bit more, um ... things in our garden and ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  ... and, you know, with the dog it's tough ...
R:  Right.
L:  ... to -- she likes to chew and she likes to -- she likes to dig.  I think just to keep her paws cold or what -- you know, they like to dig for a cold spot.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Uh --
R:  So, do you have problems, like, when you want to travel?
L:  You know, we really don't.  We've got so many neighbors that are real nice.  We'll just say, "Look, we're going to be gone a couple of days" ...
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  ... and for -- just -- just if it's, like, a long weekend I can just feed her before we go and feed her when I come home but ... we really haven't had an- any issues with that.
R:  Oh.  That -- I think that's our big issue, is we don't like to leave her, like, in a pound or anything, you know, for the week, but --
L:  No, yeah, we don't -- wouldn't like that at all.
R:  Yeah, it's kind of hard but ...
L:  Well, if you're out in the country then that would be tough, if you don't have a neighbor to drop by.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ... now, is this the first dog you've ever had?
L:  Well, I had a dog growing up that wouldn't do anything.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It just -- it would just eat and sleep.
R:  R- -- aw.
L:  So I wanted to have a dog that would do -- you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And -- and th- this dog is so smart.  I mean, she -- I was able to teach her ... you know, right from the g- go she'd -- she was quick about learning things and then she was just so smart about, you know, sitting and -- and laying down and everything.  And just a real good listener and then I could open the gate and she wouldn't ... she'd just stay right there until I tell her, "Okay".  I have to watch when I'm talking to peop- -- to people when I'm at the gate and it's open.  If I say the word, "Okay", just, like, in my sentence, she'll bolt.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  You know, she's, like -- she's that good, I mean -- but she doesn't go very far, I can just say, "Hey, Casey, come back here" and ...
R:  Well, that's really good.
L:  She'll go to the back yard and then she has a chair -- when she comes inside I say, "Go to your chair" and she'll go to her chair.
R:  So it wasn't hard to train her to stay in the yard then, huh?
L:  Oh, gosh, she was great.  We moved into a new house about a year and a half ago.  I was concerned about the new ... the new neighborhood but, I mean, she's just been ... she's been fine.  She's not going anywhere.
R:  Wow.  She can pick out her boundaries, huh?
L:  I gu- -- I -- you know, I don't know what it was but -- if she's just getting older now and she doesn't really care to be out running around or what it is, but ...
R:  So, is she fenced in?
L:  Yeah, we got a fence right away.  But even if I ... well, uh, she's still -- I ke- -- if I let her out front, she just stays by me, basically.
R:  Oh.
L:  She'll lay down in the shade or in the garage.  Sh- she likes the garage floor 'cause it's cooler.
R:  Right.
L:  If I'm out, you know, work- -- washing the car or something, she'll just hang out there.
R:  Wow.
L:  So ...
R:  Well, our dog was the first experience I've ever had with an animal, so it was a ... it was kinda different [LAUGH] ...
L:  I bet it was.
R:  ... trying to toilet train them and you know what to expect.
L:  Oh yeah, I forgot about that whole thing.
R:  Oh yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, she -- she had t- -- some troubles with that a little bit but ... um, did you read a book, then?
R:  Yeah, actually that wasn't the big problem; she did that pretty well.  But it was the chewing when we were gone.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  She'd chew a lot.
L:  So what did you do to help that out?
R:  [SIGH] Well, not a whole lot. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, the things we tried just didn't work.  You know, we even kept her kind of penned up but then she would chew on the woodwork where she was penned up, so ...
L:  Oh, gosh.
R:  Yeah, we were grateful when she grew out of that stage.
L:  No kidding.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I heard that if you give them, like, the Nylabones or some kind of --
R:  Yeah, we tried those. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that didn't work either?
R:  No.  I think she was just lonely, you know --
L:  Oh, probably was.
R:  -- working all day.
L:  Sure.  Yeah, I'm lucky, my wife stays home now so ...
R:  Oh, that is nice.
L:  She can ... basically she's got somebody around if she ever -- and ... my son can go out and play with her during the day, too, but ... she's really getting laid back now.
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  Which is nice.
R:  Ours is too.
L:  We used to go for these long walks and now when we go she has to stop and rest, so ... I don't know.
R:  Not as much energy, huh?
L:  No, not as much energy.
R:  So, are they typically healthy dogs?
L:  I think so.  I think they're ... they're pretty good.  The only health issue we've had is, uh ... she's got hip dysplasia, where the ... the -- you know how the hip is like a ball and socket kind of thing?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And with the big dogs they have problems with their hipbones.
R:  Oh.
L:  And she's got a little bit of that.  Although we haven't had any ... as soon as it was diagnosed it was kind of like, "Here it is", and that was ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  ... gosh, about three or four years ago.
R:  Oh.
L:  And it's just not -- but -- it's just been one of those things in the back of our mind, that that's what's going on, but it doesn't affect her, she still runs around, she still jumps.
R:  Is there anything you can really do about it?
L:  She can have surgery just like --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- just like a person could.  It's the same surgery they do on people; they replace it with a titanium kind of, you know, ball and socket deal.
R:  Oh, my word.
L:  Yes, so that they can ... and my wife's brother had that done on their dog.
R:  Wow.
L:  It was, like, three thousand dollars.
R:  [SIGH] Oh, my goodness.
L:  Yeah, can you believe it?
R:  No.  So when they talk about pet insurance, maybe it's not such a joke, huh?
L:  No kidding.  They have a -- they actually did it on -- to a dalmatian, so ...
R:  Wow.
L:  ... you're fortunate on your dalmatian 'cause a lot of big dogs do have it.
R:  Yeah, and she's a little heavy; I'm surprised she doesn't have problems.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Hm.
L:  Well, if you haven't heard about, you probably will --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- as she gets older.
R:  So, is it -- does it seem painful for your dog?
L:  No, it never really ... well, we no- -- wh- what happened, we noticed, was that she was kind of lethargic and we said, "Well, something doesn't seem right".  I think she was just sick, but when they took her in, they diagnosed it.  It was, like, after that she was fine, and we never gave her medicine.  We didn't give her anything to -- I think that she was -- just got -- whatever she had, like, a flu bug or whatever --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- just kind of went away, so she was not lethargic any more, so it was just that one ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  She's not been in the doctor that many -- I mean ... for issues besides the standard checkups.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  Well, you were very fortunate, then.
L:  Yeah, we had, uh, one time we cut her -- she cut her eye on, like, a thorn when we were out hiking.
R:  Aw.
L:  Cut her eye.  Other than that, I mean ...
