R:  Hi, my name's Paul.
L:  I'm Jake.
R:  Hi, Jake.  Uh --
L:  Hi, Paul.
R:  Well, I guess our topic today is pets, uh --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Um, I've got probably the whole gamut of pets, or have had at one time in my life.  I've got a dog and, ah, the wife has three cats right now, so ...
L:  Oh.  Well, I have a fish. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  I've had a lot of pets myself over the years, but right now I have two small boys and, uh ... so we don't have as many pets as --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we did at one time. [LAUGH]
R:  Sure.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  We ha- -- we had fish, uh, actually when my daughter was just -- just a baby and she would just stare for them at hour- -- for hours on end and --
L:  Is that right?
R:  She's not that old right now, she's only three years old but, uh, she, uh, [LIPSMACK] you know, she enjoys the wife's cats and trying to pet them and chase them around the house type thing and they're pretty harmless.  And our dog is probably even more harmless than the cats, so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- a pretty safe environment for them, so --
L:  Well, that's good.  Yeah, um, [COUGH], I've had, uh, [NOISE] dogs, [SIGH] cats, hamsters -- I actually bred hamsters when I was a kid, and sold 'em -- the babies to the pet store.
R:  Right.
L:  And, uh, I've had --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- fish most of my life [NOISE] probably.  And, um, I've had different types of birds.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Uh, a few guinea pigs. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You name it. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, we've -- we actually bred guinea pigs, coincidentally --
L:  I- --
R:  -- enough, ah --
L:  Really?
R:  -- we -- we've had hamsters, with the Habitrail kits slain --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- all over the house and, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, also fish, uh, both saltwater and freshwater at times.
L:  Really?
R:  Uh, saltwater were very expensive to -- to maintain and to -- to do right, so, um --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- my dad actually got interested in that -- in that hobby when I was a ... oh, probably ten or twelve years old I guess, so --
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- we had 'em round for a few years.  And, let's see, what else have we had?  We've also had parakeets, uh, nothing bigger than that, as far as birds, but ... guess -- guess we've always had pets around ever since I can remember, uh, in some form or fashion, so ...
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pretty much me too, I'd say.  Um, we'll probably, once the boys get a little bit older 'cause they're, like, two and five now ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  ... um, when they get a little older we'll probably get a dog, you know, um, and maybe a hamster or some- -- who knows, you know, what their interests will be but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- uh ... right now it's just fish.  And I enjoy that, that's a relaxing hobby.  I don't spend a terrible lot of time on it.  They're tropical fish.  They have a twenty gallon tank.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And, um ... eventually I want to get a larger one, uh [LIPSMACK] ... but, uh, that's all my plans --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for right now, really, as far as fish go.
R:  Right.  The kids will t- -- will tend to dictate the -- what type of pets you have in the house generally anyways, because --
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  -- who can resists those little kids, uh, promising to take care of them and do everything they need and then two months later deciding it wasn't worth that much effort, so ...
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] We all did that as kids, I'm sure.
L:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH] Ah, it's a learning experience, and a good learning experience for 'em.
R:  Sure, sure.  The responsibility and the, ah, the care of another is -- is always good for them, so ...
L:  Mhm.  What, uh -- is there any particular pet you have enjoyed the most?  Uh ...
R:  Probably, uh, we had a Brittany spaniel when I was growing up and, uh, I probably liked her the most.  She was a purebred AKC and, uh, a good bird dog and -- I grew up in the country so it was exciting seeing her natural instinct, ah, take off and [NOISE] and her, uh -- excuse you, son.  Sorry, I'm holding my youngest son also while I'm talking to you and he, uh --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- he likes to get in the conversation sometimes, so ...
L:  Sure. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, but yeah, we've -- he was proba- -- or th- the Brittany was probably my -- my favorite, uh, my favorite pet growing up, so ...
L:  Hm. [LIPSMACK] I'm not too familiar with them.  What do they look like?
R:  Oh, they're -- they're generally white with, like, orange spots, um, and they're -- they're very, uh, m- much a natural pointer type dog, you know, they ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  Very, ah, very inquisitive.  They're probably about the same size as a [NOISE] as a collie, maybe a little smaller than a collie.
L:  Okay.
R:  So ...
L:  Do they have short hair?  A- --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah, but they -- they shed quite --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- quite badly, though, after the winter too, oh, too.  Even though -- with short hair, they --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- um, they do shed quite a -- quite a bit.  There's hair everywhere, so ...
L:  Okay.
R:  But this one was generally an outdoor, uh, you know, kennel type dog, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that -- you know, we had an outdoor kennel and stuff for him and -- actually, I'm sorry, for her.  And she, ah, she did a -- quite well with that.  They're -- they're naturally outdoorsy type dogs so ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  And relatively easy to train [NOISE] [inaudible].
L:  Are they as a breed pretty good with kids in general, do you think?
R:  Yeah, I think so. [NOISE] Um, they're very mild mannered, non aggressive dogs, uh, other than they like to put the birds in the air, not necessarily, uh ... but that's why they're good for pheasant hunting and such because they're -- they're not ones to chase down after the kill and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and -- and chomp on the bird as if they want to eat it [NOISE] type --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- type thing, you know.  Like, some dogs, like beagles are -- are known to -- to be, uh, also good -- good -- putting them in the air but they also tend to try to chase 'em and go for the kill themselves and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- not something you want in a bird dog if you're -- if you're gaming, so ...
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I, you know, just kind of got in the back of my head to look into different kinds of dogs, um, for when we do eventually --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- get one, you know.  I've had a few myself, as I said, but, um, you know, I do want one that's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, good with children.
R:  [NOISE] Sure.  Well, uh --
L:  I heard, uh, labradors are pretty good, uh, you mentioned --
R:  They're --
L:  -- beagles.  I think they're pretty good natured usually.
R:  Right, right.  Yeah, labradors are -- are good and they seem to want to protect children, like, especially if they come into the house as puppies.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I wouldn't -- I wouldn't start with someone else's problems, type -- on any dog.  I would start out as a puppy and raise right.  Most dogs are -- are good, you know, I mean--
L:  Hm.
R:  -- I'd stay away from your -- your pit bulls in -- in that type of, ah --
L:  Right.
R:  -- environment, just because they're --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- more naturally aggressive, so ...
L:  Right, right, yeah.  Yeah.  Uh.  Well ... um ...
R:  The other, um -- I think probably the ... the cats -- I was never a cat person growing up really, [MN] but my --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- wife was, so we -- we have, uh, about three cats around the house.  Uh, they're mostly outdoor cats but they come in occasionally, especially bad weather or what have you.  But all in all they're -- they're good to have around in case field mice and anything else tend to get near.  They, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- seem to protect the place in that regards.
L:  Y- -- so I take it you live in the country now?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, we do.  We live, uh, um, [MN] about, uh, twenty miles outside of Flint, Michigan.  I don't know where you're from but ...
L:  Oh, I'm in, uh, Connecticut --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- um, outside of Hartford.
R:  Wonderful.
L:  Uh, in a little suburb town called Ellington.
R:  Oh, wonderful.
L:  Uh ...
R:  Well, is that -- that ... you said it's a smaller town, so it's, you know, more -- more country type living or more ...?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Yeah, yeah, it's -- it's a very small town and -- we have, uh, just over an acre of land here.
R:  Oh, okay, yeah.
L:  So, um, we have plenty of room for pets and --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- I look forward to getting more as, like I say, as the boys get older.
R:  Sure.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah, I think it's important for kids growing up to -- to be around animals, so -- it --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, [inaudible] I'll go along with that.  So ...
R:  It definitely helps build some character and animals te- -- give a lot of rewards back, you know, they -- they definitely always love you, even when the wife hates ya, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when you come to the door, so ...
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  They're --
R:  And even the kids some day they'll get mad at us, they'll go through that --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- stage and don't worry, the dog will still love ya, so ...
L:  Yeah.  Oh, dogs are very loyal pets.
R:  Right.
L:  It's, uh, a wonderful treat. [NOISE]
R:  I agree.  I think they're probably the best -- best pet, uh, someone could have.  I've heard of some pretty strange pets out there, uh ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I know a guy it was in the local paper here not too long ago who had pet pigs who stayed in the house and I --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- couldn't quite, uh, couldn't quite grasp the concept of what --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- would make you want to chose a pig as a pet, but ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I don't think I'll ever be doing anything quite that strange but --
L:  I don't think so either.
R:  People in Florida with their gators and ...
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  Uh, you know ...
L:  [COUGH] Well, I'll stick with the good old traditional dog myself [LAUGH] thank you.
R:  Yeah.  About the strangest I think I've ever, uh, had or, ah, was ... you know, I had -- when -- as a kid I had some snakes that I had captured, type thing.  Um, nothing exotic or, uh ... my cousin did have a -- a little, uh, boa constrictor that he got.
L:  Whoa.
R:  Um ... [LIPSMACK] he also had a monkey which --
L:  Really?
R:  -- they're very messy and hard to take care of at times, but ...
L:  Huh.
R:  Well ...
L:  How did he manage to get that?
R:  Well, h- -- my -- my uncle had gotten a permit and stuff. [NOISE] He -- they're -- they were well off enough to go through the proper channels and ...
L:  Mm.
R:  ... and go through and get what they want, I guess. [LAUGH] But, ah --
L:  Hm.
R:  Ver- very spoilt, ah, cousin actually but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that's another story for another conversation [inaudible] --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  But yeah, they did, they -- they got a monkey --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- and, uh, I guess he had that about a year and, uh, he ended up selling it back to the, uh, guy that he had gotten the permit from, I think, so --
L:  Huh.
R:  Just too -- too tough to take care of, so ...
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah.
R:  They look real cute on the TV shows but, ah --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- they're a lot more work than what they let on, so ...
L:  Wow.
R:  Almost like another human being there, you know, so ...
L:  Well, I wondered why they don't sell 'em in pet stores, you know.  Maybe that's why.
R:  Right, yeah, they're ... and they can become, uh, [MN] you know, uh, very enra- --
