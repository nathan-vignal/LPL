L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, I'm Chris, Pennsylvania.
R:  I'm Nancy.  
L:  Okay.  Where -- where you from?
R:  I live in Michigan.  Where do you live, Chris?
L:  In Pennsylvania.
R:  Ooh.  Oh, near Pittsburgh or --
L:  Ah, yeah, pretty far away.  Closer to Philly.
R:  Oh.  Okay.
L:  Yeah, about an hour --
R:  Okay, um --
L:  -- and a half away.
R:  Okay.  You have pets obviously?
L:  Yep. 
R:  How many?
L:  I have one dog, two cats, two birds and a fish.  [LAUGH].
R:  And who takes care of all your pets for you?
L:  All me [LAUGH].  The kids wanted them, but ah -- and the husband, but I got the -- the job.
R:  Oh, I understand [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  
R:  We only have one dog.
L:  Oh.
R:  It's mom's dog, however.
L:  Oh.
R:  It was the children's until it became mom's dog.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  So um you have one dog?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Cats?
L:  Two cats.
R:  Two cats.  Fish?
L:  One fish.  And two --
R:  And --
L:  Two parakeets.  
R:  Two parakeets?
L:  Yeah.  They're my little girl's.  She's three.  She loves those things [LAUGH].
R:  Um, I assume the dog is a house dog?
L:  Uh, he's a Boxer.  Yeah, he's a house dog, yeah.
R:  He is a house dog?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And how long -- have you had the pets for a long period of time, or you, uh, gathered them over a period of time? 
L:  Oh, I've always had pets, but I've had the one cat the longest.  She's, oh, about six years old now.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And um and the other cat, we had one, and she got out and got hit by a car.  I don't let them out, so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- we got another one 'cause she was crying and -- the little one, and just to keep the other one company 'cause I don't like to let them out 'cause of, you know, getting hit and the fleas and all that.  So -- but none of them get along.
R:  Now --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- who cleans the litter boxes?
L:  That would be me, of course, and everything else.
R:  Are you a stay at home mother?
L:  No, I work.  
R:  So you work, so plus you're spending -- how -- I don't know -- I don't have cats, so how often do you have to change litter boxes?
L:  Ah, at least once every -- every two days because the both of them use it.  So -- and because of the dog, I had to move it upstairs because the cats hate the dog, so I got to make sure it's clean [LAUGH].  Where before I used to have it down the cellar so I might be able to get away with three or four days, but not any more.  So --
R:  Yeah.  Fish water, change that, what, once a week?
L:  Yeah, once a week, maybe I can get two weeks out of it, but not often.
R:  And parakeets?  I assume -- are they in the same cage?
L:  Yeah, I have them both in the same cage, they're a male and a female.
R:  And what do you have to do, just line it every [LAUGH] --
L:  Well, I used to let it out because it was one of those hand fed ones and it didn't bite.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But then it started, like, nipping hard so it's like, "I'm not going to let you out any more", so I got another bird so I didn't feel so bad, and it -- they're getting along pretty good.  'Cause he -- he comes over to you, he's a very friendly bird and he actually picked up phrases of talking.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Hopefully they were all good phrases?
L:  Yeah, and then he just started biting and he drew blood and I got afraid of him, so I just got him a -- a friend [LAUGH].
R:  There you go.
L:  'Cause I didn't want to let him out and have the cats eat him anyway and I was getting afraid of him anyway [LAUGH].
R:  Now, what do you feed your parakeets?  Just bird food?
L:  Their food and I -- and I found out when I took him to the vet, 'cause he got sick, that they can have anything but avocado and chocolate, so he loves --
R:  Really?
L:  -- pizza crusts.  Yeah.  
R:  Even pizza crusts?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, he -- they love pizza crusts.  
R:  Huh.  Amazing.
L:  So -- yeah.  I never knew that.  
R:  Do -- yeah.  Do you have any idea how much it costs for cat litter and dog food over a week?  [LAUGH].
L:  A lot.  I know.
R:  I mean, should you be getting a tax deduction off this from the government?
L:  I wish we could.  I know.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  It costs as much as your children do. 
R:  Oh, I agree.
L:  And just as much as time and everything else [LAUGH].  My husband's --
R:  What about uh --
L:  -- always yelling, "Even if we're low on money, you make sure those animals are fed".  I'm like, "Yes, I do", you know?
R:  Now, what about veterinarian expenses alone?  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, well, since it -- the only one that really goes to the vet is the dog.
R:  Ri-
L:  Now, the cats, since they're inside, I don't take 'em and -- all the time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Just to make sure they have their shots 'cause they -- they're not allowed out.
R:  Now, what kind of dog do you have?
L:  A Boxer.
R:  A Boxer?  So he doesn't really need to -- to be groomed that often, right?
L:  Nope [LAUGH].
R:  He's short haired, so he doesn't --
L:  Just got to wash him --
R:  -- leave a whole lot of --
L:  -- once in a while, yeah [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  So he's not a real vacuum cleaner type animal, huh?
L:  No.  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Just the cats when they're in that shedding time, so -- but they're short --
R:  And how --
L:  -- haired too. 
R:  How often do they shed?  
L:  Um --
R:  Is there, like, one particular season of the year that they shed?
L:  I guess like after the winter, when it starts getting warm.  Like, in the spring --
R:  Mm, okay.
L:  -- they started shedding.  You couldn't touch them.  You had hair everywhere.
R:  Oh.
L:  But --
R:  You don- you don't have children with allergies or anything do you?
L:  No, thank God [LAUGH].
R:  I was just gonna say [LAUGH] --
L:  No.  I don't know what I'd do if my kids were allergic to my pets [LAUGH].
R:  Mm.  Now, which -- it'd be a hard choice.  How much time do you spend with your pets during the day?  I mean, obviously I assume you'd spend more time with the cats than the dog?
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  Cats than the dog?
L:  -- we had to section it off [inaudible].  We have two big rooms that aren't carpeted --
R:  Ah.
L:  Well, three actually, and then 'cause the way our house is set up, and then I have a gate across for the baby, but since she doesn't need it any more, it's still up for the dog and the cats get that area.  They get the other living room and the upstairs, and the dog gets the other living room and the kitchen and bathroom [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  So, when I'm in there -- I'm out here on the computer, I spend time with the dog, and that's like half of the day.  Then when it's time to go watch T.V. for the night, the cats come in and -- you know, they're in and out.  They don't like the dog, but they get the run of the house, so I feel -- you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- sit out here as much as I can with the dog, so --
R:  Yeah.  What do you do with your dog during the day, because are you concerned, like I am, about leaving the dog home for X number of hours without being let out?
L:  Well, my -- my aunt -- I usually have up here watching my little girl, so -- if it's warm, he'll -- we have a chain outside 'cause he keeps running away.  It's pretty big.
R:  Oh [LAUGH].
L:  He has like a sixty foot run out there, and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- he's on that and then when he's hot, she leaves him in and locks the gate and put the fan on for him. 
R:  Oh, that's good. 
L:  So -- but he keeps getting out.  Fence and all.  I can't keep him in my yard for anything.
R:  Mm.  The dog --
L:  And the fish, well obviously I don't do nothing with that so [LAUGH] --
R:  Yay.  
L:  That was one of those carnivore --
R:  Carnival type, huh?
L:  -- ones, and I didn't think he'd last as long as he did.  He's been going for two years now.  It's like, oh my God.
R:  That's unbelievable.  
L:  If you didn't want it to die, it would die.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I don't want to give it away because I feel bad, but --
R:  What does your dog eat?  Are -- are you keeping him strictly on dog food or is he one of these beggars?
L:  Yeah, he's a beggar.
R:  [LAUGH]. 
L:  He eats a lot of table scraps.  A lot of table scraps.  That's what he looks for.  He's a pizza dog, too.  He loves his pizza crusts [LAUGH].
R:  I understand that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Does he give you the eye?  Gives you this look and --
L:  Yeah, he won't -- he won't take from anybody at the table.  He'll sit there, but if you turn your back when the little one's sitting here eating, he'll take it right out of her hand, but he --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- won't do it to anybody else, 'cause he knows [LAUGH] --
R:  He knows better.  
L:  But he knows -- when he -- if he hears the refrigerator opening, he's running -- he's right out there.  
R:  Mm.  He's a kitchen dog.
L:  And he usually gets something [LAUGH].
R:  He's a kitchen dog.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  Amazing.
L:  Yeah, he really doesn't eat much.  He waits till ten o'clock at night to eat his dog food.  
R:  Really?
L:  Because -- yeah.  I guess it -- 'cause of all the food he gets during the day.
R:  Out -- out of desperation, that's his last resort?
L:  Yeah.  He'll wait till ten o'clock, when I watch him, I'll leave him out for the night and I'll come back and, it's, "What are you eating now?"  I'm gonna have to get up in two hours [LAUGH] and let him out again.  
R:  Now, do -- how old are your children?
L:  I have a sixteen year old and a three year old. 
R:  Does the sixteen year old feed the dog uh --
L:  Oh, no, no, no.
R:  No?  Not at all?
L:  Nope.  
R:  Mm.
L:  My three year old helps me, but --
R:  Right.  By accidentally through [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, but the sixteen year old, she wanted the cats, but she doesn't want to help with them [LAUGH].
R:  Mm.  Imagine that.
L:  Same thing with the husband.  He wanted the dog, and he doesn't want to help with him [LAUGH].
R:  Mm.  Now, who takes the dog out for walks, or you just kinda let him out --
L:  We just --
R:  -- on the chain and let him --
L:  We just [NOISE] we just let him out because we have a big yard and first we were -- I got the underground dog fence and that didn't work and then I got --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- another one and it shocked him too much.  I didn't -- I didn't like it on his neck.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  So now I just stick with the chain when he's out there.  'Cause it's a pretty big one.  The whole -- our yard, you can't even go into 'cause it's the dog's yard.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  But he --
R:  You have to be careful where you step in your back yard?
L:  Yep.  Yes, you do.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  
R:  For the uh land mines or whatever he leaves?
L:  Oh, yeah.  No, but --
R:  Do you --
L:  -- he usually goes over -- he -- for some reason, he's very protective of -- of his area.  Even if you -- if you approach his dog bowl out when he's -- his water bowl, you go to get it --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- he jumps on ya.  You're not allowed over there 'cause that's his area [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, just --
L:  He gets mad.
R:  Do you live, like, in a neighborhood where if he looks out the front window he goes bonkers when another dog goes by?
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  We live, like um -- we don't live in a town, we live like in a little rural area, like a -- you know, a back road in R.D. but we have --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- houses and stuff across the street and as soon as he sees somebody going by, he's going crazy and -- and he's always barking [LAUGH].
R:  Now, where does he sleep at night?  Does he have like a pillow or does he try to go for a bedroom or a bed or a floor or something, or --
L:  Oh, no.  He's a couch dog.  He has his own couch.  
R:  He's got his own couch, huh?
L:  I just bought a -- a new one of those um pull out Futons.
R:  Mhm?
L:  I didn't even get to use it because it's all dog hair, dog dirt.  He took it over.
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  You can't even --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- sit on it.  It got to the point where I got tired of putting -- cleaning it every week and putting towels over 'cause the --
