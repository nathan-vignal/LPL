R:  Hi, Lisa.

R:  My name is Kate.  How ya doing?
L:  I'm fine.  How are you?
R:  Tired.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm fighting my allergies today and, um --
L:  Oh, are you?
R:  -- I can't bite on a tomato and my lip swells up and --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- I look like I've gotten Botox injections --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I guess then ...
R:  Walking around saying God forbid that should happen to me, you know?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] My lip ...  So, I'm like fighting the allergies.  It's beating me up.
L:  Ah, where do you live?
R:  I live in Seattle.
L:  Oh, okay.  Wow!
R:  In Bothell, a little town outside -- well, a big town outside of Seattle.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  How 'bout you?
L:  In Texas.
R:  Oh, my!  Where?
L:  McKinney, Texas.  It's, um, north of Dallas.
R:  North of Dallas?
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  That's nice.  I flew into Dallas.  They had a red carpet at the airport when I flew there.
L:  A red carpet?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, a long time ago.  I was getting a plane to go to -- I think up to Aspen --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- to go on a holiday with my brother --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I flew -- I had to fly to Aspen -- to -- to Texas before I could get a connection.
L:  Oh.
R:  In the old days I think it was Delta or -- or United used to make connections through Texas to go ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Sometimes you had to go that way so ...
L:  Yeah.  Oh.
R:  [LIPSMACK] But do you have a c- -- do you have animals?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Any an- -- any animals?
L:  We have a dog.
R:  You have a good.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You spend time throwing things?  How old is the dog?
L:  Um, he's -- he'll be two in September.
R:  Oh, cool.  Is -- how -- what kind is he?
L:  A Westie.
R:  What's a Westie?
L:  Well, the white little, uh, terriers that look like spotty dogs.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I -- oh, they're really adorable.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's what they're called, Westies?
L:  Yeah.  It's a West Highland White Terrier.
R:  West Highland White Terrier.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I used to have Sheltie collie dogs and, um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and Shet- -- and Shetland sheepdogs --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I had a German Short Haired Pointer dog.  So --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I kinda favor them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're nice animals.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yours sounds nice.  We had a Wire Haired Terrier that we, uh -- we went to -- to school --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- we took it -- took him to school.  It learned how to play basketball.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Really bizarre.  He used to dribble and stuff.  [LAUGH]
L:  Wow!
R:  It was really wild.  It was more of a -- like the -- in the -- the Tin Man with [inaudible], uh --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that kinda -- it was more of, um -- it kinda like jumps around a lot.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yours doesn't jump around a lot does it?
L:  No.
R:  Yeah.  That's why I like your terriers a lot more, you know?  It's not real biting or anything.
L:  It's not like a Jack Russell that just bounces up and down.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, Jack Russell that's what we had.  Oh, my God!
L:  Oh, was it a Wire Haired Jack Russell you had?
R:  [several inaudible words] [LAUGH].  Funny, but yeah ...
L:  You always see 'em in the movies.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's right.  They almost sound like they should have a -- a little hat on and running around with a little tux on or something, you know?
L:  I don't know how they get 'em well behaved enough to put 'em in the movies --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because every one I've ever been around has just been crazy.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, we had to really literally send it to the -- we went -- it went to training school --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and then it came back, but it was like --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- totally wired and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, used to chase the milk truck and then finally it got run over, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and like chasing the Blakely Laundry truck.
L:  Oh.
R:  Once -- he used to chase trucks.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, my Mom would forget what day they were gonna arrive, she never knew exactly what time, you know?  I mean --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they don't tell you exactly.  So --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- we'd just be out there and heave ho and well, we lost one but --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- but it's okay.  So, yours is just a two year old.  Did you get it when it was real- ...?  Is it harder to toilet train those, or are they pretty good?
L:  Um, pretty good.  Uh, we got him when he was four months old.
R:  Oh, that's cool.
L:  But, um --
R:  That's ...
L:  -- he wasn't potty trained when we got him, but he was fully potty trained by a year.  So ...
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  Yeah.  He doesn't ever go in the house anymore unless it's raining outside and he doesn't like to go outdoors --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- when it's really raining, but ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, he might not do well in Seattle, but ...  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's true, especially in the winter.
L:  Yeah.  But, no, he's good.  They're supposed to be the -- some of the least yappiest -- least yappiest --
R:  Mhm.
L: -- the -- the, you know, least yappier of the terriers.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, he's pretty yappy sometimes.  His name is Barkley.
R:  Oh, what a cool name.
L:  But we named him that before we -- before we knew he even barked.  So ...  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, neat.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, do you have any pets now?
R:  No.  No, not any more.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  I used to have a -- we have, uh, sort of a -- in the building where I am living th- there's a -- a cat who is now cut.  She was a fluffy cat, like, um, an angora.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But they -- they cut her -- they shaved her body --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- down to her feet and down to the end of her tail and down to her head --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- like the nape of her neck.
L:  Like a lion cut?
R:  Yes.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And now she looks like a lion [LAUGH] and she's just --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- really funny and she lives around and we -- you know, she'll come in -- in the morning and sit in the sun and we'll feed her and the children play with her and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- she's -- I wanted to take her to get immunization shots and get her de-fleaed and any shots that she might need on a yearly basis, but I haven't taken her over.  But she's not my own cat, you know?  So, I'm sort of being as habitue of a motherly --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- habitue here.  [LAUGH]  So, I thought maybe I should try to, you know, get myself activated to doing that for them.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But I don't know who -- you know, I don't even know who exactly the cat belongs to.  We just see it wandering about and it likes -- likes ...
L:  Kind of the building cat.
R:  Yeah.  And it loves sitting in the sun.  So ...
L:  [COUGH] Well, somebody must, uh, own her or she wouldn't be, uh ...
R:  Yeah.  They wouldn't have cut her down to size [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and they wouldn't have given her that wonderful little lion hair cut, which is -- she used to have one of those collars that have little studs on it, you know?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  She was like -- like a punk rock cat.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But now, you know, she's a -- now she's a lion cat.  She whisks her little tail around like a little paintbrush.  She's really adorable.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I have no idea how old she is, but she's a -- she's a -- she's a sharpie.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  She's a real hotty.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I'm a pet sitter so I --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- am familiar with a lotta different kinds of animals.  [LAUGH]  So ...
R:  Oh, good.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  How -- like how many people in your town?
L:  Um, we have about fifty thousand I think.
R:  Wow!  That's a big town, huh?
L:  Yeah.  Just -- and it's a suburb of Dallas so ...
R:  Oh, yeah.  I see.
L:  Yeah.  So, I don't know how many are in Dallas.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But I think McKinney has fifty or sixty thousand.
R:  Uh-huh.  I've never been to there -- to, um -- to Dallas.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I mean, except for once.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Just in and out, a quick -- a quick trip.  I wanted to go to San Antonio.  It seems awfully nice.
L:  Yeah, San Antonio is nice.  There's ...
R:  Is it a pretty place to go for -- for a holiday?
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  We went last summer actually and, um, went to ...
R:  Which -- where do you have to -- do you fly into Houston or --
L:  No, they have ...
R:  -- Boston or ...?
L:  Well, we drove --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- 'cause we live here, but they have an airport in San Antonio.
R:  Oh, that's ...
L:  But I'm not sure, you know, how ...?
R:  Is it near -- it is near Mexico?
L:  It's [MN] -- I don't know how many hours it is from -- Texas is so big.  It's ...
R:  Mm.  Really?
L:  Yeah.  It's probably a good three hours from Mexico, but that's just a guess.
R:  Mhm.  Do you get to groom the dog too?  You have a -- a little brushing session?  Does it shed very much or is it ...?
L:  Uh, he's supposed to be nonshedding, um --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- doesn't shed very much but, you know, in the --
R:  In the win- ...
L:  -- like when it gets -- starts getting warmer he sheds more.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, he's not -- not too bad.  I mean, we -- we brush him.  We probably don't brush him as often as we should 'cause he hates to be brushed, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [COUGH] but there's a Westie cut, we get him groomed every six weeks or eight weeks, something like that.
R:  And they like -- they like just -- they're like sort of pillow dogs?  They're not like those --
L:  Yeah.  He --
R:  -- Pekinese or ...?
L:  -- he sleeps with us.
R:  Mm.
L:  He [COUGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he'd -- he'll jump off in the middle ...
R:  Curls up and ...
L:  Huh?
R:  He's a curl up dog?  He's a cuddly dog?
L:  He -- he is --
R:  Kind of?
L:  -- I mean, I wouldn't call him a -- a lap dog, but he does ...
R:  He's more protective?
L:  Uh, yeah, they're really good watchdogs, um ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, uh [COUGH], he -- he likes to sit --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- on our laps every once and a while.  He most of the time sleeps -- just stays under the bed a lotta the time.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] He likes dark, cool places, huh?
L:  Yeah.
R:  He's a dark, cool place -- place dog?
L:  He just likes -- likes it under there.
R:  Oh.
L:  I don't know.
R:  That's funny.
L:  [MN] He kinda sleeps all day and then he comes out at night and wants to play.
R:  [MN]
L:  But he's good with the kids pretty much unless they're around him when he's eating and he kinda snaps at 'em, thinks that they're gonna try to steal his food, but ...  [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.  [LAUGH]
L:  Kinda not very ...
R:  What -- are you still in school there?
L:  No.  No.  I've been out for [MN] eleven years.
R:  Oh, my!  That's good.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  You have a family and stuff or ...?
L:  Uh-huh.  We have two kids.
R:  Oh, how great.
L:  A seven year old and a four year old.
R:  Oh, my, that's nice.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Terrific.
L:  They're a lotta fun.
R:  And they must get along pretty well with the dog too then, huh?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  So, it's good with kids too?
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  That's terrific.
L:  He's pretty good with ...
R:  Was he around when the baby was born or ...?
L:  Uh, no.  No.  Um, we've just had him for -- oh, about a year --
R:  The kids were kind of like ...
L:  -- and a few months.  So ...
R:  Uh-huh.  The kids were kind of like two and four?
L:  [COUGH] Yeah.
R:  Or two and ...?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Really three and ...
R:  So, they were sort of like not be totally pulling tail and pulling --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ears and stuff?
L:  Right.  Yeah.  They were kind of old enough not to ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  Although, you know, they did that some, but ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  [COUGH] He likes to play ball --
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  -- and stuff.  So ...
R:  Oh, neat.  That's good.
L:  Likes to run around in the back yard with 'em.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [COUGH] But, yeah, we used to have a cat and -- when my ...
R:  What -- what did they tell us about ...?  Siamese cats can -- I mean, um, they're -- they're interesting.  I like them.  I usually like having cats around.
L:  I -- I like cats too.  My Dad's really, really allergic to cats so ...
R:  Yeah.  I got really a bad case of it one time and I had to send the cat -- the longhaired cat back.
L:  Yeah.  We had a longhaired cat.
R:  It was really unbearable.  I just couldn't believe how allergic I was, but then --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- I -- I got -- you know, I got over --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that allergy to it.
L:  It's bad.  My Dad can hardly be in a -- in a house ...
R:  Yeah.  I just couldn't even -- I mean, I couldn't breathe.  I was -- I never had --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- really asthma very badly --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it was just all consuming.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I thought well, you know, this won't work and it was just a beautiful kitty.  Oh, my, it was so lovely and it had such a lovely disposition and I -- I had already had the longhaired -- I had the Short Haired Pointer dog and I had another cat too.  So, it was just -- I guess just too much down[?] or, you know, I thought --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- maybe there wasn't gonna be any, but I didn't -- I didn't even know if that was -- I wasn't even really aware of how -- a problem that could've been --
