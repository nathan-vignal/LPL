L:  Yeah, we had frogs at one point, but they were --

R:  [LAUGH] What did you -- did you keep them in, like, a --
L:  They were in, like, an aquarium. [COUGH]
R:  Okay, an aquarium.  That's cool.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, it's a little more unique than, but --
L:  Yeah, well they never did anything, just sort of --
R:  Yeah, exactly, [several inaudible words] that you kind of watch them and that --

R:  Yeah, I'm quite [several inaudible words] --
L:  You can have a fish, right?
R:  Yeah, a fish, I guess.

L:  Huh?
R:  Out of a cage?
L:  Yeah --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- so, [COUGH] but, uh, we found 'em with the aid of a mousetrap.
R:  [LAUGH] [MN]
L:  Of course, it kind of ruined their day, but --
R:  That -- that sounds like fun. [LAUGH] Yeah, important to get 'em back.
L:  Yep.
R:  [MN] So, hm.
L:  Well --
R:  Have you ever had any, like, dogs or anything?
L:  Uh, yeah, unfortunately we had a couple of dogs and they were --
R:  Small, like, dogs?
L:  No, absolutely not.
R:  Really, what kind of dogs were they?
L:  Oh, one was a, um, [MN] a Schnauzer --
R:  Schnauzer.
L:  -- and the other one was a Rhodesian Ridge back kind of a --
R:  Okay, and they was how -- small dogs or --
L:  Well, the Rhodesians are a large dog and the --

R:  Yeah, on the west coast.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And how about you?
L:  Uh, I'm in Texas.
R:  Texas, okay.
L:  The only truly civilized state.
R:  Oh, right. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I've been out there the once, up in Dallas for, like, a week [inaudible].
L:  Oh, you did?
R:  Yes, couple of years -- like, three years ago.
L:  Oh, it's hot, what, in summertime?
R:  Yeah, it was really hot.  I'm sorry.
L:   Oh, man, Dallas is really hot in the summertime. 
R:  Yeah, it was t- -- extremely hot, spent, like, all day in the pool or inside --
L:  Yes, that's a good place to be in Dallas --
R:  -- air conditioning.
L:  -- is a pool.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  Or in the A.C.
R:  Mhm. [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] So ...
L:  So, um --
R:  Is your cat kind of like a indoor only or do you let it go outside --
L:  Yeah, this is definitely an indoor cat --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- he's, uh, terrified when he accidently gets outside.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, stands at the door and looks in and -- and, uh, cries and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- wonders why he's outside.
R:  Mhm.  So, why -- why didn't you like you dogs?
L:  [SIGH] Oh, they're just real stupid and demanding.
R:  Yeah, a lot more --
L:  You know, y-you shove -- you come home from work and they're there, demanding attention, you know, and --
R:  Yeah, they want to be played with --
L:  -- just jumping up and down --
R:  -- and walked all the time.
L:  -- licking you and all kinds of stuff, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, the last thing I want to do when I c- come home is to have somebody jump all over me, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  Mhm.  They definitely require a lot more attention than cats or any other --
L:  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah, the cat, we ca- -- you know, we go on vacation, we just leave the cat --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, give him plenty of water and food and stuff --
R:  And that's it.
L:  -- and he kind of takes care of his business, so --
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.
L:  Kind of like fish, I guess, right?
R:  Yeah, exactly --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [inaudible] to neglect them and there'll be so many repercussions.
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] --
R:  But --
L:  Yeah, we went to California one time and, um --
R:  Oh really?  Mhm.
L:  -- it was real pretty.
R:  Yep, [LIPSMACK] yeah, some parts are, mhm.
L:  Uh, drove down the, um, that Highway One --
R:  Highway One, huh?
L:  -- down toward, um, Carmel and down that a way --
R:  Carmel, yeah, that's a nice area.
L:  -- yeah, and, uh, Highway One was just great, it's really pretty --
R:  Yeah. [SIGH]
L:  -- not too many t- -- places like that in Texas.
R:  Yeah, I'm sure there aren't. [LIPSMACK]
L:  So ...
R:  Oh, um ... [MN] 
L:  So, they come back on the line or how does that work, uh?
R:  Uh, no, you act like ten -- if this is your first call, after ten minutes, or something, I think.  What happens is, like, uh, that same voice just cuts you off and gives you thirty seconds to end the conversation.
L:  To wrap it up.
R:  Mhm.  The last call, like, ten minutes ago I got cut off, my cell phone w- went dead.
L:  Oh, is that right?
R:  Yeah, that's pretty disappointing, but I'm sure the other guy was kind of pissed too. [MN]
L:  Oh, yeah. Huh --
R:  Yeah, I felt kind of stupid. [LIPSMACK] Yeah, hm, [MN] [NOISE] --
L:  California --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- San Francisco, so, I knew somebody who went out there and lived on the streets for a while in San Francisco --
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, there's -- San Francisco area has a lot of, uh, problem with homeless --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, this person was a kid at the time and --
R:  Oh, really?  Yeah, too bad.
L:  [MN] -- was being stupid [NOISE] --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and, uh, went out there and [MN] lived on the streets --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- eventually straightened out and now she's in the Navy, so --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well, s- some [inaudible]  --
L:  It was a learning experience, I think.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, how old are you?
R:  [LIPSMACK] I'm sixteen.
L:  Oh, okay, you sound young.
R:  And -- and you?
L:  Uh, I'm fifty four.
R:  Mm. [MN]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, you sounded young.
R:  Well, yeah. [LIPSMACK] Yeah, mm.
L:  So ...
R:  So, how old were you when you had your dogs?  Were you, like --
L:  Oh -- [LAUGH]
R:  -- how long -- how many --
L:  -- oh well, let's see, that's probably, um, I think the first one was probably in -- probably my, um, mid thirties --
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  -- and then, uh, the last one [MN] was probably, uh, I think we got rid of that stinking dog, um, probably about, maybe six years ago.
R:  Really?  Yeah, I think we're -- [SIGH] dogs are -- are a little more, uh -- but see, I'm not -- I'm not -- it's, like, more the, I don't know -- like the Labrador Retrievers are more popular, with like --
L:  Oh yeah --
R:  -- [SIGH] younger people and stuff --
L:  -- they're pretty friendly.
R:  Yeah, [NOISE] especially younger people --
L:  I don't guess they'd be too bad if you had a big place and --
R:  -- yeah, I mean --
L:  -- you know, and they could --
R:  -- how much is it?
L:  -- roam around on the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- country or something, you know, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- go chase snakes or something, then --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- that'd probably all right, but --
R:  But, yeah, there's a big difference between, you know, like, Labrardor Retrievers and, like, Shih-tzus and stuff --
L:  Ooh, yeah, Shih-tzus --
R:  -- you know, I mean --
L:  -- only the --
R:  -- this is ki- -- almost kind of like cats --
L:  -- only the Chinese could screw up a dog that bad.
R:  -- well, I don't know.  Huh?
L:  Only the Chinese could screw up a dog that bad --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I mean, look at all that -- sis- -- you know, I mean, what [MN] k- kind of genetic fluke is that?
R:  [MN]

L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- yeah, and so his --
L:  One of those complicated life do- -- um, d- -- family deals. [LAUGH]
R:  -- so it was, like, it was his dad's family and stuff, so I -- but --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- I went tag along with them and we just went on vacation to Dallas.  Think --
L:  Oh, okay --

L:  Oh, okay, yeah.
R:  Kind of like a Malibu Grand Prix, but it's --
L:  Oh, where you -- where you get drive the cars and stuff?
R:  Exactly, but it's geared towards more older people, kind of like teenagers and up --
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
R:  -- 'cause it's a lot more --
L:  [SIGH] Um, my daughter and I went down to, uh, Puerto Vallarta --
R:  Uh-huh.
