R:  Good.  How are you?
L:  Good.
R:  You have a pet?
L:  I have two cats.
R:  Two cats?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I'm pet less.
L:  You're pet less?
R:  I'm pet less --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- because my -- my son is allergic.
L:  [MN]
R:  Yeah.  But, um, I had pets my whole life.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] But he likes them.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, we'll see.
L:  [LAUGH] Uh ...
R:  Um ...  I'm sorry?
L:  That's okay.  I was just gonna say that, uh, a lotta times they have things you can give children to get, you know ...
R:  He's, um -- he's three and a half.  So, we have to wait it out before we can start giving him that kinda medicine.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  But, um, one thing that people have told me I can get maybe -- he's allergic to dogs too, but you can get like a dog, uh, like a poodle or something that doesn't have --
L:  Yeah.  Something --
R:  -- that.
L:  -- something, right, with, um, less hair or ...
R:  That -- it's like there's -- I guess some dogs have like a fuzzy hair and other dogs have a coat and the coats have oil in it --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- and that's what causes the allergies.
L:  Uh-huh.  I see.
R:  So ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Are you a dog person too?
L:  Well, I -- I like dogs --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- as long as they belong to somebody else.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  They're a lotta work.  Right?
L:  Yeah.  Well, that's it.  I'm -- I'm -- you know, I'm like fifty eight and I only work part time now.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I had five children and they're ...
R:  Wow!
L:  Yeah.  They're all raised and gone off and have their own families --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- and so now I'm -- I'm just with my friend, my boyfriend, and, uh, we like to just say well, "Let's go somewhere" and we --
R:  I know.
L:  -- up and go.  Well, if you have dogs then you have to worry about getting somebody to watch 'em and ...
R:  Right.  And cats you can leave for how many days?
L:  Oh, you can leave 'em for three, four days and not worry about 'em.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  What do you do, just leave the food out?
L:  Yep.  I just make sure that they got a couple of dishes full of food and a [NOISE] couple of dishes of water.
R:  I can -- is that -- is that one of them?
L:  That's my baby.  She's not even a year old yet.
R:  Oh, that's your -- that's one of your two cats?
L:  Yeah.  She -- she loves to go outside and ...
R:  Okay.  Where do you live?
L:  In Wisconsin, upper Wisconsin.
R:  Okay.  I'm from Michigan originally.
L:  Oh.
R:  But I'm in New York now.
L:  Oh, you're in New York.
R:  Are you from, uh -- are you from the freelance club?
L:  No.  I --
R:  No.
L:  -- I belong to Refund Makes Sense.
R:  Uh.
L:  That's where I -- I signed up on this.
R:  Okay.  Yeah.
L:  And this is my third call and the last two ladies both were from Refund Makes Sense.
R:  Isn't that funny?
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  So, what city in Wisconsin?
L:  Phelps.
R:  What is it?
L:  Phelps.
R:  I don't know that.  I was from Bay City.
L:  It's near -- near Eagle River.
R:  Mm.
L:  Eagle River's the snow mobile capital of the world.
R:  Okay.
L:  Right.
R:  I know all about it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I spent a lotta time in those areas.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  Um, sort of maybe like two hours from Warsaw --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- which is another big city, but, yeah.
R:  And how's your weather been?
L:  Oh, really beautiful.
R:  [MN] It has been?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I guess you're on the other side of the Great Lakes, right?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, we haven't had anything but rain for I would say two and a half months.
L:  Oh, that's sad.  We ne- --
R:  Isn't that terrible?
L:  -- we could use some rain.
R:  Ah, it's been horrible.
L:  Send it over here.  [LAUGH]
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I thought it was raining everywhere.
L:  No.  No.
R:  Yeah.  We haven't had any summer.  It's only like fifty degrees too --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and we're supposed to be warmer than you guys.
L:  Oh, it's been beautiful here.
R:  Wow!
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  That's why my -- my -- my baby kitty she just loves to go outside and both my cats are declawed --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and, you know, there's a lotta fishers around here and fishers ...
R:  What's that?
L:  Fishers are small animals, look sort of like a mink and ...
R:  Oh, right.  Right.
L:  Yeah.  They'll kill a cat.  So ...
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, they'll eat 'em.  Mhm.
R:  Oh, my gosh!
L:  That and there's like, uh, uh, eagles.  Eagles will pick a cat right up and take it away.
R:  Really?
L:  Mhm.  So, since they're declawed they're indoor cats --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and so if they go outside then I put 'em on a little harness and a leash.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  And then I tie 'em ...
R:  And you walk 'em around?
L:  Yeah.  I'll like tie 'em out in the yard while I do yard work.
R:  Right.
L:  And she just loves to go out there and so when I don't take her out for a while and she cries.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  That's what you heard most of the time --
R:  Right.
L:  -- when I'm on the phone she's crying 'cause she wants to go.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, I'm try- -- I'm gonna try and get some kind of a cage that I can put out there, um ...
R:  Yeah.  Your yard isn't fenced in?
L:  No.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  No.
R:  [MN]
L:  We live in the -- in the woods.  So ...
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  Yeah, it's beautiful.
R:  Yeah, my Mom has that kind of property 'cause she still lives in Michigan --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and she has a cat and a dog.  Um, they just roam free, you know?
L:  Mhm.  Oh, we had ...
R:  This cat's kind of -- it -- I mean, it would prefer to live outside if it could.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  It gets in a lotta trouble, you know?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  But they don't have those kinda animals that you have --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- you know, that they have to be worried about.
L:  Right.  Well, I guess that there's so many bad animals around that would kill 'em.  So ...
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow!
L:  And after -- you know, I mean, I get 'em declawed and I get 'em neutered, uh, spayed --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so that they can't have babies --
R:  Right.
L:  -- 'cause there's enough unwanted pets --
R:  I know.
L:  -- in this world already so ...
R:  I know.  It's sad, isn't it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Even like in my neighborhood in Brooklyn -- Brooklyn, New York [MN] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, there's so many strays.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah.  People get 'em and they don't take care of 'em and, you know, they just keep having babies and then they let 'em loose and ...
R:  I know.  I know.
L:  So ...
R:  What kinda cats do you have, do you know?
L:  Um, the baby's a tortoiseshell --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and the other older one she's a tuxedo.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What's their names?
L:  Tarsha --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and -- and Sneezy.
R:  Sneezy?
L:  Sneezy, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  She had a cold when we got her.
R:  I see.
L:  So, my -- my boyfriend -- she just was sneezing all the time.  [NOISE]  So, we named her Sneezy.  [LAUGH]
R:  I hear her now.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I -- if it was up to me I would have a white cat named Snow White and then I would have Dopey, Dot --
R:  Right.
L:  --  Grumpy.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  You'd get that many?
L:  Well, maybe if I lived alone --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I think I would, but for ...
R:  You said you have kids?
L:  Yeah, five of 'em.
R:  Do they like the -- the cats or ...?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  Yep.  They have pets of their own and, you know --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- they're all -- they're all married and have families and ...
R:  Right.
L:  Although my son his -- his, uh -- his little boy is allergic to cats --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and they have a cat.
R:  They do?
L:  But they're just more or less boarding it for somebody --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- you know, keeping it [inaudible], as they can't have it right now and so they're keeping it for 'em, but ...
R:  Oh, and how's the -- the son doing?
L:  It -- it doesn't -- you know, I think after a while ...
R:  You get -- you -- you build up your immunity.
L:  I think that's what it is.  So, you know, I mean, you can always try that too.
R:  I know when I visit my Mom with her animals, you know, my son is like dying the first day.  He's got hives and he's itching and ...
L:  Mm.  Mm.
R:  But after like a day and a half he's better.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's -- I think that -- that that does work that way.
R:  So, I don't know.
L:  Like you say, you know, there might be certain breeds that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that are better, you know?
R:  Like a -- a skinless cat.  [LAUGH]  They're -- they're not skinless --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they're hairless.
L:  Oh, those are so ugly.  [LAUGH]
R:  Aren't they?  I think they're a small fortune too.
L:  Yeah.  I think so too.
R:  They're pretty exotic.
L:  Yeah.  Uh ...
R:  So, I don't know.  I think we're gonna stick with our fish.  We have fish.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I have -- I actually have a fish too.
R:  Do ya?
L:  Uh, one of those -- what do ya call them?  Real pretty, uh -- Beta.
R:  I don't know what that is.
L:  A -- a Beta fish.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They live in a jar with, uh -- you can just get a -- a small jar and then you put this certain plant on top --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and they live in there, just -- it doesn't have to be ...
R:  With water?
L:  Right.  Doesn't have to be a big aquarium.
R:  Wow!
L:  They get all their -- all their -- whatever they need off of that plant --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- and, um, mine his name is Chaz and when I wanna feed him I tap on the jar and then I -- you know, I always -- they don't need a lotta food.  You just --
R:  Right.
L:  -- wet your finger and -- and I stick it in the food and then I hold it above the water line and he jumps up and eats it off my finger.
R:  [MN] And you got it at a pet store?
L:  Yeah.  He -- actually I got him at Wool Mart.  Well, I got him ...
R:  Maybe I should look for that --
L:  Yeah.  I ...
R:  -- for my son.
L:  Right.  I got him as a birthday gift two years ago from my niece and ...
R:  And they live that long?
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And ...
