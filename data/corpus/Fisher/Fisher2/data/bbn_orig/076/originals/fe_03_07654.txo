L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hi, I'm Angie.
L:  Hi, Angie, my name is Greg.
R:  Hi, Greg.  How's everything by you?
L:  Uh, just fine.  Hey, um, I guess the topic is pets, right?
R:  Right, pets, you know, whether they be cats, dogs, fish, birds.
L:  [MN] Uh, oh okay.  You have any? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I have a couple of fish.
L:  Okay, right now, what kind?
R:  A goldfish and a gourami.
L:  Uh, I'm not sure of the latter, I've had a few of the first, but, uh, what kind of fish is the latter, what's it -- what's it look like?
R:  Oh, it -- it -- it's a gourami, it's a little white fish and it's got blue -- 
L:  [NOISE]  
R:  -- stripes on it, it's got little [NOISE] long fins at the end.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay, what doe- -- does it have, like, any special diet or something or ... [NOISE]
R:  Just eats regular tropical fish food.
L:  Oh, really?  Okay, it's not like a little piranha you put in that eats up the other fish or -- [LAUGH]
R:  No, no, no, no, no.  Not even like an algae either, or a betta.
L:  Oh, really?  Okay.  Yeah, the only thing I've ever had are, like, goldfish and guppies as a kid, you know, but, I pa- [NOISE] -- friends who had, like, um, miniature sharks, stuff like that, you know, um, I'm trying to think this one guy, had this interesting fish -- it did -- sat on the bottom, was a bottom feeder and it basically [NOISE] just -- it would ea- -- it would wait for the other fish to die then only ate, like, so often, you know, it's, like, when the other fish would die it would eat their [LAUGH] carcasses.
R:  Oh, yeah, I've had a couple of bottom feeders like that.  The -- the algae eaters I had though, like, I left on vacation --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I like to get extra fish because people like to come over to the house, you know, and harvest fish from our fish tanks, 'cause they're so friendly and love people.
L:  Oh, really?  Well, how many fish do you have, if you can harvest -- you got, like, a fish farm, huh? [NOISE]
R:  Oh y- -- well, I used to have, like, four little betta splendens and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I took them on the road with me --
L:  [NOISE] Okay.
R:  -- and, like --
L:  You took 'em on the road?
R:  -- yeah, I took 'em to upstate New York and I gave 'em to some guy who took 'em over to Canada.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.  Was -- that's like, uh, +transporting, like -- transporting, uh -- it's not illegal to do that, is it, you know -- wild animals? [LAUGH]
R:  Oh no, no.  Betta splendens is perfectly legal --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  --  getting bettas to really love you --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- and bond with you isn't always easy right away and once they -- once -- one thing about betta splendens, once they bond with one human --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they'll start bonding with other people too.
L:  Are you serious?  Fish bond t- to humans?
R:  I've -- I -- you must think I'm nuts.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's just that the --
L:  [MN] I've never heard of it before, that's why. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I mean, it's just like [several inaudible words], the little guys get dependent on you.
L:  [NOISE] No kidding.  Well, in other words, I mean, you know, like, a cat, I mean, a cat is less, you know, people friendly, so they say, than a dog.  Now, I've --
R:  Than a dog?
L:  -- never had a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- yeah, I've never had a d- -- a cat, but I mean, I know you can leave a cat alone, you know, and a dog you can't, you know, at least for any great length of time. [MN] But, I mean, you know, like, a cat, you know, they eventually form a bond with you [NOISE] and you know that they miss you to some degree, but how can you possibly tell, like, a fish would miss you or something like that?
R:  Well, they start looking in the tank for you and, like, if you play the radio they -- they miss the radio.
L:  [NOISE] I get -- are you -- they respond to music?
R:  Yeah, they respond to music, oh definitely.
L:  [NOISE] No, no, I believe you, I've just -- I've just never, like [MN] -- I -- I never knew fish were so, you know [LAUGH] -- so now you make me feel bad the next time I have a fish sandwich.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Are you a vegetarian?
R:  Um, for the most part, I mean, but however, you know, I mean, once in a while, you know, I eat chicken and the chicken just tastes just like the bread that I eat and the bread tastes just like the chicken, so, you never know, you could be eating fish flakes or lard in your -- your, uh, pecan pie and if you say you're a vegetarian you definitely have to avoid jello.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, well, I mean, I'm not a veget- -- I'm a partial, you know, I mean --
R:  Right.
L:  -- some things I won't eat and certainly things like veal, because, uh, I mean, I don't -- I don't agree with how they treat, you know, [NOISE] animals to turn them into veal and so forth, that's just, you know, [NOISE] if you've ever heard of what they done, what they do --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- I mean, what -- what's done and, um -- but, no, I had no idea about that with fish and -- and chicken, I mean, yeah, everybody eats a lot of chicken pretty much, [NOISE] but I've heard stories -- my sister, she's a, um, biologist and she told me this one story about a chicken that got -- it's apparently a famous case -- it got it's head cut off --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [NOISE] and they, uh, somehow were able to keep it alive, I mean, the heart kept beating and all that and somehow they fed it still down it's throat and the thing lived for, like, two years and they used to take it fairs and everything, you know, the, uh, chicken without a head or something and it was technically still alive, so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, whenever I have a chicken sandwich or something, it's like, I don't feel all that bad because I don't, you know -- I don't -- certainly don't know if chickens can bond with you, but, you know, you -- now that you're telling me fish can I feel, you know, worse about eating a fish than I do chicken. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, it- it's pretty [SIGH] surprising, I mean, and the thing about the betta splendens is that they have both lungs and gills.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, okay, um --
R:  So, I mean, even though they're fighting fish and the males go nuts --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- at the sight of one another --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- they have to be kept in separate tanks --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- they breathe like humans and they -- they -- they -- they -- as well as li- -- or mammals as well as like fish.
L:  [NOISE] Wow, wow.
R:  A- a- and it's like i- it -- they're -- they're interesting little creatures, they -- they seem to be a lot smarter than some of the other fish I've met.
L:  Oh, it sounds it.  Yeah, no, I had no idea, I thought fish, you know, when I was a kid, like you said, you know, [MN] uh, yuppies and the- -- guppies --
R:  Guppies.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yuppies, guppies, yeah, it's goldfish.
L:  They're all the same, right? [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  Whether they're in the water or on -- on land. But, um, you know, that and goldfish and so forth, but, I mean, the basic fish, you know what I mean, [NOISE] and stuff, you know, all you did is you looked at 'em in the bowl.  [NOISE] Every time, you know, it seemed like I was looking at them, they'd look at me and, like, swim away and I used to say, "Uh, you know, you live in your own little world" and I, you know, I fed 'em, you know, food [NOISE] and that was it, you never thought more of it, but, uh --
R:  Exactly.
L:  I'd no idea you could bond with them.  [NOISE] Yeah, I saw a Seinfeld thing though the other night [MN] and they were bringing back a, uh -- an old, you know, rew- rerun and they're bringing back a, uh, fish, uh, they had, I guess, in like, you know, a bag from the fish shop or whatever and, you know, there was a time limit to get it into the aquarium and everything like that --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and apparently they d- -- they didn't get back in time, but [MN] you took -- way up to, uh, where is it? [NOISE]
R:  Um, up to, um -- up to Niagara Falls.
L:  So, how long of a drive was it for you?
R:  That was like, uh, that's like a seven hour drive.
L:  And that fish survived it?
R:  Oh, yeah, well they weren't in little bags, I kept them, [SIGH] um, in, uh -- I brought the tanks with me --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I s- -- I brought -- I brought -- I kept each fish --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in a separate gallon jug.
L:  Oh, okay, okay.
R:  So, like, a gallon -- a gallon of water --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  -- it's just fine, you know, for a fish to live in, as long as they're not longer than about an inch or two.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.  No, I never knew that.  I knew they love -- you had any, like, other pets, dogs, cats, you know, what have you? [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I've had birds, a couple of birds --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- and they like -- they've got to liking people --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and it's just I didn't ever really get to be an expert animal trainer --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, I l- -- I let 'em go to somebody who would really appreciate them, at least being hand tame, and --
L:  [NOISE] Okay.
R:  -- knowing a few things --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  -- a- and -- and like a dog -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the dog I had, well [SIGH] he went absolutely nuts, the beagle.  He didn't relate well to the people in the house at all.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, really? [LAUGH]
R:  No, a- -- however, it did this -- the p- people I'm staying with like cats --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  -- and when I -- when I stay in my own digs, the best I can do is fish, 'cause birds are too noisy.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, yeah, I hear you, I hear you.  Well, I had two birds when I was a kid and -- [MN] all right, yeah, and it's important, okay, um, anyway, sorry, I was getting interrupted there -- no, I was going to say that, uh, I had, uh, some parakeets when I was a kid, I think I was, like, seven or eight [NOISE] and second or third grade and the teacher, in the summer time, um, gave us, uh, like, pets that we could take home, so we could return after the end of the summer and, you know --
R:  Oh, that's so cool.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, and, you know, I chose the parakeets and it was probably a bad decision on my part because every morning at dawn, you know, we had a cover over the cage, you know, but they would know when the light --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- came out and they would make such noise and then, one time we let 'em out, uh, I think my parents had gone, my brother and sister and I let 'em out and, you know, we thought we'd just let 'em fly round the room and somehow --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't know, the door got open -- I think the dog walked in, he heard all the flapping, he pushed the door open -- next thing you know --
R:  Oh, no.
L:  -- the dog's chasing after the birds --
R:  I gotta go --
L:  -- the birds are flying all the --
R:  -- I'm sorry, I -- I -- my train just arrived.
L:  Oh, did it really?  Yeah, they --
R:  Yeah, I'm sorry [SIGH] --
L:  -- called me away too.
R:  -- okay, thank you.
L:  Do we get credit -- do we get credit?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
