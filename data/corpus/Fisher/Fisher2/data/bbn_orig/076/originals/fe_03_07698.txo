R:  Hi, my name is Denise.
L:  Hi, this is Jackie in Florida.  How ya doing, Denise?
R:  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm in West Virginia.
L:  You're in West Virginia.
R:  Yes.
L:  Huh, just up the coast from us a little bit.  [MN]  What an interesting topic, isn't it?
R:  It is.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Uh [COUGH], most importantly, honesty.
R:  Yes, that's what -- that's what I thought --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- uh, honesty is number one.
L:  The absolutely most important.  Are you married now or ...?
R:  Yes, I am.
L:  You are?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.  I'm not.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [COUGH] How long have you been married?
R:  Um, let's see.  Thirteen years.
L:  Thirteen years?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That's cool.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [COUGH] So, even now we have very different -- different statuses.  We definitely agree on -- on that.
R:  Right.
L:  But w- what do you think is -- is the second most important?
R:  [MN] I think -- well, it goes along with honest, but trustworthy.  They have to be trustworthy.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  Yep.  Yeah, that -- that -- that is true.  I think it'd probably be a tie between that and -- and willing to communicate.
R:  Well, yeah, that's -- that's an important too.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Very much so.  [LAUGH]
L:  We're going through some little rocky -- I just recently got back together with a -- a guy I used to date seven years ago --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- and, um, we got back together exactly seven years from the day that we first met.
R:  Oh, wow!  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's pretty neat.
L:  So, uh, it was really weird.  I mean, I was working and he happened to walk into where I was working and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- just kinda ...  And we're having some small problems with his child who, uh [COUGH], is a little spoilt.
R:  Okay.
L:  But, um ...  [LAUGH]
R:  How old is the child?
L:  Uh, well, he's twelve now.
R:  Okay.  Yeah, that's a difficult --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- that a d- -- a difficult age.  I have a twelve year old myself.  [LAUGH]  So ...
L:  [LAUGH] Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Well, it's -- it's particularly bad because his Dad's made excuses for him over the last seven years and now he's even worse than he was before.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, uh, yeah, we just had an issue last night where I told him that [COUGH] he needed to make up his mind, either he needed to -- either he needed to be an adult and be with me and we were going to be a team or he needed to be his son's best friend and be somewhere else.
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, because -- yeah, 'cause it's not gonna work if he's not.
L:  So -- so far today things have been pretty good.  But, uh -- and my boyfriend's son said, "Well, how ...? -- 'cause he went and spent the night at a friend's house last night 'cause I just couldn't deal with it anymore --"
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and he said, "Well, how did you guys work things out?" and I just looked at him and he said, "It's called communication".  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  But, yeah, and trustworthiness, yeah, obviously is -- of course the way I feel about it is if I -- if I can't trust him I don't need to be with him to start with.
R:  That's true.
L:  So ...  But ...  [MN]
R:  And giving is another one, I mean, 'cause, you know, one -- a person can't be one -- I mean, you know, can't be a taker all the time.  He has to -- or she -- has to give also.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's true.  That's true 'cause there -- there are so many situations, you know, in life where it's so one sided.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yep.  [COUGH] I have a tendency being a giver so I have a real -- I have a real hard time finding guys that are willing to give back.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  There's a lot of them that ...  I don't mind being on the receiving end, but ...
R:  Right.  They're take, take, take.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Right.
L:  Yep, that's for sure and usually, you know, I'm -- I'm -- I'll keep doing it.  I have not learnt my lesson yet.  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, and I don't think you're gonna change my personality.
R:  Right.
L:  If -- if it's part of your personality you're really not gonna change it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But I get to a point where I've had enough and I'll just walk away, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it'll be okay, all right.  I've -- I've given as much as I'm going to and [LIPSMACK] now it's your turn to go on down the road and try and find yourself something better because this ain't happening no more.
R:  I think women are more -- I mean, for the most part -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- are more giving than most guys.  Now, there's a lot -- there's some guys out there that are.
L:  Yeah.  Well, one thing I have to say Corey's pretty thoughtful.  I -- I still have -- and he was -- it was funny 'cause the first time he came in this house 'cause I didn't -- he -- he walked in and he looked up and I -- I have my parents' old dry sink[?] in my second living room and on the top of it is this blue vase that has -- he used to do this thing where if I was like having a not so good day or whatever he would go out and he would buy me a fabric rose, you know, the -- the silk roses --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that they sell in the convenient stores and stuff and he -- he would buy one and he used to bring it home to me and so I have a whole vase full of them and he couldn't believe that I still had all of them all these days, that they have sat -- well, they were over in the other house and then they came over to this house when I came over here.  So ...  And he's started doing it again and I have another little vase on top of the T.V. that's got five or six of them in it.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  So, yeah, he tries to be thoughtful and I appreciate that --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- 'cause it's -- you know, that's -- that's something that a lotta guys that -- get, get, get -- and he doesn't have a whole lot of money, he's disabled --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and, um, I mean, he can get around -- get around, but he can't -- a lotta things he can't do and he's got constant back pain and he's had two surgeries on his back and on his ankle --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and he's just -- you know, he got hurt [COUGH] when he was in the army and he has a rough time sometimes, but ...
R:  You know, that's nice 'cause any -- it's just the thought that counts.
L:  It is.
R:  It doesn't really matter what it is.
L:  Yep, that's it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  He did find me a -- a cute little one with a little teddy bear on it --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and then he found me one the other day that he ne- -- we've never seen one like it before.  It had a little unicorn on it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I know he tries to, you know -- and he -- and he doesn't just always just grab one and he always tries to make sure that it's one that's different from the other ones and, you know, one that's a color that I don't have or, you know, something that sets it apart and makes it more unique.  So, that's always -- that's always a nice thing [LAUGH] to see him walk in the door with something for me.  It's always fun.
R:  Yeah, that's nice.
L:  Yeah.  I was just looking -- I got weird colored ones too.  I've got a purple one.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I've got -- he even got me a black one one time.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  He said, "And I don't wanna you to -- I don't wanna you to, you know, take this the wrong way.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's just because it's a color you don't have".  [LAUGH]  I was like, "It's okay.  It's all right".  But, uh ...  So, is -- is your twelve year old the only child you have or ...?
R:  No, I have a three year old that's sitting on my lap right now.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  [MN] Oh, goodness.  I'm past those days.  Thank you, Lord!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, uh, my baby is still at home.  He just turned nineteen.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH] And that's the other thing.  I kinda set myself in this pattern of -- of -- of -- of -- of being child free --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and -- and then all -- then it's like -- you know, it's like C.J. asked me something the other day if I had something in the house, Kool Aid I think --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I said, "You know what, hon?"  I said, "I'll be honest with ya.  When you don't have kids in your house for, you know, four, five years --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- your habits usually it changes your patterns and changing the way you do things and [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and it just kinda ..."  He's like, you know, "You always had Kool Aid, you know, before when -- when we all together".  "Yeah, my kids were still kids".
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  You know?  So, seven years ago, you know, the baby was only twelve.  So, yeah, I had kid stuff in my house, but those days are gone.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, I got a grandbaby but he was -- in my old house next door.  So, he's never that far away.  When -- when he comes over he can't bring his stuff with him, you know?
R:  And how old is he?
L:  Uh, he'll be two next month.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yep.  He's a little tough guy too.  He's cute.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [COUGH] It's nice when you can send 'em back home.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, that was fun.  Where's your Mom?  [LAUGH]
R:  Huh.  Yeah.  That's what my Mom says about my daughter.  She's like -- well, when she -- she keeps her for me, you know, when I work.  So ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...  And my son goes to school.  So, he'll -- you know, in the summer and I teach.  So ...
L:  Oh.  What -- what -- what do you teach?
R:  Special education.  High --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- high school, yeah.
L:  Oh, cool.  You've gotta be a very dedicated woman.
R:  I enjoy it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I have some great kids.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Even the worst ones --
L:  I'm sure you have your -- 
R:  -- even the worst ones are great.
L:  -- I'm sure you have your challenges too.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  They're not -- you know, this year hasn't -- wasn't too bad though.
L:  [MN]
R:  I had a bunch of --
L:  That's good.
R:  -- I had a -- a whole lot of great kids.
L:  Oh, that's cool.  This is kinda --
