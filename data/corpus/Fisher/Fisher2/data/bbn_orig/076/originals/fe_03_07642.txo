L:  Hello.
R:  Hey, how are you doing?
L:  Oh, a guy! [LAUGH] Hi.
R:  Why, is that strange? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I've never -- I've -- I've done this once before but I've heard that guys are hard to come by on this survey.
R:  Oh, are they?
L:  Anyway, what's your name?
R:  This is my first time.  Ah, my name's Butch.
L:  Butch, I'm Erica.
R:  Mhm.  How are you doing?
L:  Good, how are you doing?
R:  Ah, just got --
L:  Who got you into this? [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know, there's some guy at work give me this number to call, then I called --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so this is like the first time, y- -- [LAUGH]
L:  That's funny 'cause, you know, I did it -- it's gotta be, like, two or three months b- -- now and, um, they call every now and then and I thought, "Oh, what the heck, I'm just working outside, I might as well answer the phone" so [LAUGH] ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  You get to meet new people I guess or whatever, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  It is -- i- it's funny, 'cause this survey is out of, um -- I'm -- I live in Pittsburg --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it's out of, um, Penn -- Penn Hospital or -- I don't know what it is, Penn State or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- one of those.
R:  Well, I live out of Washington, actually.
L:  Washington state?
R:  PA.
L:  Oh, PA.
R:  Little Washington --
L:  Oh, well then, you're close.
R:  -- yeah.  Yeah, right over the hill, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, well heck, yeah.  Right over the hill.
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  Oh, you crack me up.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, do you have a pet, Butch? [LAUGH]
R:  Well -- well, I -- I had a pet about a year ago.  Well, I've still got one, actually.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it's -- it was a tomcat.
L:  A tomcat.
R:  You know, so n- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- now it just goes and comes back every once in a while, you know, to say hello.
L:  Yes, well -- oh, is that right?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And -- and he's -- but he knows you, that's cool.
R:  Yeah, he comes in --
L:  Do you leave food out -- do you leave food out for him?
R:  Yeah, well, he comes in, I give him some milk, food, whatever he wants.  Sometimes he chills out on the couch a while then -- you know, to catch some rest --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- then go back outside, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Now that's my kind of pet.  Now -- [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, really?
L:  Honestly, because, uh --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- they want a cat here and I'm like, "No, I just ..."
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, I -- I have a problem with the shedding.  I'm, like, I'll have to have my farm some day and have all the animals but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I have a rabbit, he's in a cage --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and he runs out on our deck about twice a day --
R:  Cool.
L:  -- for about an hour and ... he's almost nine so he's -- he's old and, uh --
R:  I've never had a rabbit. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] What's that?
R:  Never had a rabbit.
L:  Never had a rabbit?  Yeah, my, um --
R:  Nah, not as a pet anyway.
L:  My husband got him for me on my twenty first birthday and ... and I -- this year I'll be thirty and I just can't believe it but, um ... you know, this box was moving and I'm like, "What's that?" and it was the first time I was living on my own so he thought I needed a little companion so -- at the time he was, like, housebroken and everything but since we've moved, oh my gosh, probably six times, different states, then he's ... and, uh, he's lost the -- the -- the training but, uh, he has a nice cage and [NOISE] he'll -- he's able to come in the house whenever I can tolerate him. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Can you train rabbits or what? [LAUGH]
L:  Well, he was trained --
R:  Yeah, I mean --
L:  -- and -- but then he m- --
R:  Like an animal, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Huh.
L:  Well -- do you mean, like, litter trained or ...?
R:  Potty training and [LAUGH] all that, yeah.
L:  Litter trained, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  He w- -- he was.
R:  Uh.
L:  But now, you know, he just -- he's kinda -- he's not so great about it.  But I'll tell you one thing he did last night.  This is so funny the topic is pets.  Usually he can be on the deck for any amount of time and -- we forgot about him and it was eleven o'clock and it was raining.  And I said, "Oh, shoot".  A- -- but he'll hide under the -- something to stay dry.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But that little thing, he hopped off the deck, down seven steps, into the garage and he got into his own cage.  And I'm not kidding you, the cage is, like, three feet off the ground.  He's a very good jumper.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But -- and I -- I looked over in his cage and he's all wet.  He was probably like, "You are so rude to me, you couldn't even put me in my cage". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  So he went and got in himself.  I forgot --
R:  Is it covered up or, like -- it keep him dry -- or her, whatever?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh.
L:  Yeah, the -- to -- to get dry, you said?  What --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, has it got, like, sides on it, you know, so that it'll stay dry?
L:  Oh, definitely, definitely.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  This is, like, the m- -- the mother of all hutches --
R:  [COUGH] [inaudible]
L:  -- it's like i- -- it's, like, eight feet long by three -- two feet wide and it's got -- I'm talking to my survey partner, Butch.  My husband's like, "What are you doing?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  He's just got home.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But anyway, I'm putting mulch down and talking to you about my rabbit, so -- [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, what's your pet -- what's your cat's name?
R:  Um, actually I just called him, "Cat". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  'Cause I really couldn't figure up a name, you know, and a cat's just obviously --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- cat, you know.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean, the cat listens to it though.
L:  [NOISE] Well, that's good.  Oh, good.
R:  You can say, "Hey, cat" and it just looks right at you like it knew its name. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And how did you -- how did you come to find him?  I mean ... he --
R:  Well, some -- you know, long time -- a couple of years ago, you know, I knew this girl and she had to get rid of him 'cause she was moving.
L:  Oh.
R:  And it was a little kitten then, you know.
L:  Aw.
R:  So I got the cat, bring him home, you know, he was a little wild, you know, a little kitten fella.  And he just stayed here like my best friend, actually, you know.  Then I guess he grew older --
L:  That's really cool.
R:  -- and wanted to, like, check the world out, you know what I mean? [LAUGH]
L:  That's pretty neat, though.  He'd -- obviously trusts you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Cats -- cats are really funny like that, you know, they're just -- they're really independent and that's just --
R:  Yeah, there's -- they can be strange --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- put it that way. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Um --
R:  I mean, the thing they say about cats is they --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- look around and notice different things, you know.  They know who's coming, you know, if the cat looked at the door I knew somebody was coming.  It's like, you know --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- they knew, you know.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  So, it's pretty cool.
L:  That is pretty neat.  Huh.  We will someday have to get another cat or something.
R:  Well, this one comes around.  Actually, I'm working all the time, actually, so that's good, you know --
L:  Oh yeah, what do you do?
R:  I'm a maintenance --
L:  I'm getting off the subject, but what do you do?
R:  Yeah, no, I'm a maintenance man. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, are you?
R:  So I'm, like, yeah --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- I'm, like, on call, you know.
L:  I have a high respect for you.
R:  Uh --
L:  I could use you here at my home, I'm ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I honestly could.  There's --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- everything's broken. [LAUGH]
R:  Everything's broken.
L:  A lot of things are.
R:  We are --
L:  We just had a --
R:  Yeah, I work at --
L:  -- mm, somewhat like a sm- --
R:  -- George Washington Hotel.  You know where that's at?
L:  What's that?
R:  George Washington --
L:  Yeah, we lived right in town.  We were, like, um ... well, uh, maybe you would know.  No one in town knows but it -- I say Brighton Heights and everybody's like, "Where's that at?"
R:  Yeah.
L:  Have you ever heard of it?
R:  Uh ... I think once or twice. [LAUGH] I don't know where it's at though, yeah.
L:  Once or twice, yeah.  We're -- we're really just -- you know the Ohio River Boulevard?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Sixty five?
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.
L:  We're right off of that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, before you get to Bellevue.
R:  Oh, yeah, okay, I know about what area you're in.
L:  Yeah.  Brighton Heights, I guess -- see, I've just lived here two years but from what they tell me is years and years ago there used to be a lot of [SIGH] a lot of, uh, millionaires or the rich people used to live in this area.  There's a lot of really big, big homes.
R:  Oh.
L:  And -- but, you know, of course that was years ago.  It -- now the --
R:  Yeah, they turn 'em all into apartments now?
L:  Well, that and -- it's just, you know, it's overrun by whatever you wanna call the type of people.
R:  Mm.  Yeah.
L:  And it's just not maybe the best but, you know --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- we've found cheaper housing here and we're only here for a few years so ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh, I mean, I like it.  I'm -- I'm from Ohio so ... it's --
R:  Well, I was born in Ohio actually.
L:  Oh, really?  What part?
R:  In Cleveland.
L:  Cleveland?  I'm from Canton.
R:  Mm.
L:  Um, I say Canton but really it's a small town called Navarre --
R:  Uh.
L:  -- which is -- um, you ever had Nickles bread?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That where Navarre is, Navarre makes that, so --
R:  Uh.
L:  It's like the beginning of, um, like, Amish country.
R:  Oh, all right.
L:  Really small towns, so ...
R:  Mm.
L:  But yeah, we're here in Pittsburgh and now you're living in Washington.
R:  Yeah.
L:  My, uh, brother -- sister lives there.  Um, she works with horses at the meadows and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- she's always --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- busy with them, so we're -- we're hardly ever there but --
R:  And --
L:  -- I'd like to get to Washington more often. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, now, there ain't really nothing here.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, there is but there ain't.  You --
L:  There is or there ain't, I kn- --
R:  I don't know -- I don't kn- -- well, don't know how -- I don't know how to explain it, you know. [LAUGH] I mean, the --
L:  Oh, I know what you mean.  That's how Navarre was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or Canton even.  I mean, there's things there, I mean, but, I mean, w- -- but since we've been here there's so many more things to do, you know.  There's --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Pittsburgh is a big area.  I mean [LAUGH] ...
L:  Yeah, it's definitely --
R:  ... they got all kind of parks around there, you know, other stuff to do, you know.
L:  Yep.  I find 'em all the time, new parks --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's amazing.  'Cause we have two little ones and, um [SIGH] we're always trying to get 'em out and about, do some ...
R:  Mm.
L:  ... do something fun.
R:  Well, here, you know, they're closing everything down mostly and making other stuff, you know, that ain't worth a crap, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  Oh, no.
R:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We usually --
L:  Hey, um -- what --
R:  Getting to be a ghost town. [LAUGH]
L:  Is it?  Is it?
R:  Oh, yeah, that's what it seems like to me and I lived here for a long time, you know.  There's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- nothing here for kids, you know, they're --
L:  Well, heck.
R:  -- they closed the Y down, they closed the library down, you know.
L:  Jeeze.  Well, that's no good.  That definitely doesn't --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, attract people to l- -- wanna live in the area.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  No.  That's not good at all.
R:  Mm.
L:  Nicky -- her name's Nicky, I don't -- I'm not even sure where she lives, she's just in an apartment, but it's good enough for her 'cause it's close to her job but --
R:  Oh, yeah.  [several inaudible words] I mean, there -- it's all right but, you know, there ain't nothing really, you know what I'm saying? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Spectacular or something like that.
L:  Yeah.  Isn't that new baseball team there though?  The Wi- -- the Wild Things?
R:  D-, um ...
L:  Wild Wi- -- yeah.
R:  Supposed to be but they're -- you know, you can never see 'em or y- you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, there ain't -- it ain't like a everyday seeing 'em thing, you know?
L:  Right.  I just heard -- they had an advertisement on the radio and I thought, "Ah, maybe some day we'll go see them.  It's a lot cheaper than a Pirates game".
R:  Oh, yeah, probably.  I do- -- I don't like baseball [LAUGH] I mean, so --
L:  I -- I really don't either so I don't know why I'd -- I even said that.  I'd r- --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'd rather watch football or [LIPSMACK] really nothing. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, I mean, like, when they said, " [inaudible] the Wild Things", look, I'm saying, like, uh, "Okay, who cares, you know --"
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  "-- move on", you know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Who cares if we're here, [LAUGH] you know.  No, they're there.  [several inaudible words] but ...
L:  Yeah.  Oh, that's funny.  Oh, it's a nice day.  Are you outside?
R:  Well, actually I was.  I'm -- I'm in and out all day long. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah, that's right, your job.
R:  Like, doing stuff here, doing stuff there, yeah.
L:  'Cause it -- are you, like, just with a small company or j- -- or by yourself or ...?
R:  W- well, I'm -- do you know where George [inaudible] -- Washington Hotel is, in Washington?
L:  Mm ... no.
R:  Oh, well, it's right in the center of town, it's like --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- it's big apartments now.  It used to be the George Washington Hotel.  It's real old, like a hundred years old apparently.
L:  Oh, cool.  Cool.
R:  And all that -- [MN] like, old -- old stuff are still in there [LAUGH] and it's kind of hard to fix sometimes.
L:  Ah, definitely.  Well, my dad was a plumber and ... when he still worked, and he'd always have o- old apartment buildings he was [MN] working in and he couldn't stand it. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
L:  And we lived in quite a few or those ourselves in Cincinnati.  Oh --
