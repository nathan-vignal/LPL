R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  It's a guy, how interesting.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  My name is Margot.
L:  Hi, Kevin.
R:  Do you have a pet?
L:  Yes.
R:  What do you have?
L:  I have a m- miniature doberman and two cats.
R:  How do they get along?
L:  Ah, well ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  ... the cats were b- -- they were born -- they were born, uh, in the same house when I got the dog.  Like, they were kittens when I got the dog, so --
R:  So they know -- they just -- grown up that way.
L:  Yeah, they think -- they think they're dogs now, so ...
R:  Oh. [LIPSMACK] Well, I have -- I guess I have two.  One we have a brown lab.  That's more my husband's dog.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then we have a poodle.
L:  Uh-oh.
R:  A little red poodle.  Um --
L:  Opposite in size there, huh?
R:  [LAUGH] Completely.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, uh, the poodle, he thinks he's the -- he thinks he's the big dog.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, they're just yap dogs.
L:  I know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Mine, she thinks she's a b- -- full grown doberman the way she, uh, barks at everybody.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  She -- she has ears like a watchdog, so ... I just --
R:  They hear everything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Unfortunately.
R:  I just thought that was just little dogs that did that.
L:  No.
R:  But how -- how big is a miniature doberman?
L:  Ah, well, my cats are bigger than her.
R:  Oh, really?  That small?
L:  Yeah, it's about the same size as a poodle, chihuahua.
R:  I guess I've never seen one.
L:  Yeah, little min pin.
R:  Hm.
L:  They're nowhere --
R:  You have two of those?  No, two cats and then the one dog.
L:  No, two cats and then the one dog.
R:  Right.  Okay, that's right.
L:  Yeah, getting rid of the cats this week though.
R:  What are you going to do with them?
L:  Ah, a friend of ours is taking 'em.
R:  How come?
L:  Ah, just two much work.  They're starting to get bad.  They're three years old but -- but the boy and the girl are just -- with their bathroom habits, they're just -- I don't think the boy and girl are supposed to be able to go together in the same one or something.
R:  Uh-huh.  They're --
L:  'Cause he's st- --
R:  -- they're indoor cats then?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  He's starting to spray or something and it's really not [MN] working too well.
R:  Ah.
L:  Too much trouble.
R:  Yeah.  Well, that's one thing about a dog, is you don't have a litter box or anything.
L:  Oh, God, it's great.  Uh, we could probably train her -- you too, with the poodle, you could probably train 'em to go in a litter box --
R:  I guess.
L:  -- it would probably be so much easier.
R:  It'd be easier on our lawn.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] We have -- we have a few dead spots where he goes out and -- and it -- doesn't pee a lot but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [MN] it's just in the same place all the time and ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  ... [LIPSMACK] w- -- it just -- yeah, it's kind of hard on our lawn, we've decided.
L:  Yeah, me -- me and my girlfriend live in an apartment right now, so it's easier to just walk her outside.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's not our lawn, you know.
R:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
L:  We don't own the lawn, so ... m- --
R:  Yeah, it's ours although I guess -- I guess --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- if we ruin our own [LAUGH] it's our --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- our l- -- 'cause, um -- it was just kind of funny that this came up because, ah, last Saturday we -- I was out, um, [LIPSMACK] out doing some errands and had my dog with me.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Well, I got out at one place and he hopped out of the car.
L:  Uh-oh.
R:  I didn't know it.  I live in a real small town.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] So when I realized it -- and it was a while before I realized it, like, oh, it was about four and a half hours before I'm going, "Hey, where's the dog?"
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So we got in the car --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and we started looking for him and -- and ... and the g- -- you know, in -- at the beginning of the c- -- this call, you know, they asked you, "How important is your pet to you?"
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I got to thinking -- I thought, "Oh, if he was gone, just think", I -- there's -- 'cause I was just -- thought of, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- no more barking when people came to the door and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I was kind of relieved in a way, I thought, "Oh, I'm sure somebody's picked him up and I'm sure he's in a good home and ..."
L:  Mhm.
R:  "... and stuff".  And, well -- [LAUGH] so I felt -- I felt kind of bad that I didn't want t- -- that I didn't feel sadder that he was gone -- more sad.
L:  Yeah.
R:  My kids weren't real upset, 'cause he's more of an adult dog, he's not really a kids' dog.
L:  Okay, yeah.
R:  Anyway, well, he's back.  Some people knew some people that knew and -- anyway, so --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- we ended up getting him back and I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  So it made me kind of question, like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- "Gosh, do I really love my dog or ...?"
L:  Yeah, this thing --
R:  But --
L:  I get you.
R:  [LAUGH] And we'd -- you know, I have three kids and so, you know, I mean ... they take priority [MN] --
L:  Yeah, I was going to say, they --
R:  -- I -- they just are ...
L:  M- --
R:  You know, I -- so I don't even spend a lot of time with him.  He does sleep in my bed though.
L:  Oh, gosh, yeah.  This one is sleeping in -- I'm -- I'm watching TV, sitting in bed now and he's over -- she's under --
R:  Right there.
L:  -- the covers right there sleeping.
R:  Yeah. [MN] And some reason -- uh, maybe big dogs are this way too, but they like to be right there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, she's --
R:  That's funny, I thought -- I -- I didn't know how many people really let their dogs get in their bed with them but --
L:  [MN] We didn't want to but it was --
R:  You know.
L:  -- just -- we couldn't stop it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It was impossible.  I guess --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- for her being small, where she has to show dominance.
R:  Did -- did you get her as a pup?
L:  Yeah, she was about a year old.
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  So, she's three now --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so -- it was ... I mean, she was a little older than normal puppies but ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I mean, she -- she puts herself to bed.  We'll be out watching TV in the living room and we'll think, "Where the heck's the dog?" and she's in there --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- under the blanket with her head on the pillow.
R:  She's just waiting for everybody else to come to -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's her bed and she just lets you sleep in it.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, we'll c- -- we'll turn over in the middle of the night and her head's on the pillow just like this, with her paw straight up in the air and [inaudible] --
R:  Is that right?
L:  Oh, it's amazing.
R:  Oh, that's funny.
L:  And the thing is, she's a little black dog so she's a heating blanket.  It's -- God, I hate -- I hate the hot so --
R:  The heat, yes.
L:  Yeah, so I mean, I'm --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I want the air on and she's under there and making me sweat.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh yeah, yeah.
L:  But yeah, the -- the same thing happened to me Sunday.  We were, uh ... I got home from a fishing trip and we were at my girlfriend's parents having a little picnic out back.  And the dog -- they have -- they don't have a fence around their backyard --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they have, like, a, you know, maybe a hundred feet -- hundred yards [inaudible] and then, like, a drainage ditch and stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So the dog, you know, she usually -- you know, it's kind of like, for me, I'm babysitting 'cause my girlfriend -- you know, when I'm around, the dog doesn't listen to her.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So I had to get up every five minutes to go see where she was and --
R:  Check on the dog.  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, so somebody was watching her out front, but they decided to turn their back on her and there she was, gone.
R:  Oh no, yeah.
L:  So for, like, an hour we were looking for her, and finally we found her back there in the drainage ditch 'cause she couldn't get back out.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Ah.
L:  But, you know, the same thing, I was thinking -- you know, I'm running through the woods calling her name like, you know, "I don't -- will it really bother me?  I don't know", you know.
R:  If she was gone.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know if it would be easier or, you know -- I don't know.
R:  There -- 'cause there can be a lot of responsibility.
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  In a way, they -- [LAUGH] and --
L:  It's -- it's, you know ...
R:  They are.
L:  Bu- -- it's a pain in the butt.
R:  They're a big d- -- yeah.  But I -- you know, I think that, uh, if we as, um -- [MN] you take on responsibility, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to do it, and so you kind of -- [inaudible] -- but I know some people that are just devastated.  I mean, they -- they -- you know, their dog is their life.
L:  I'm -- yeah, like, my girlfriend --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- would have been.  She would have --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- been crushed.
R:  Been really sad, yeah.
L:  Yeah, like she is -- she's kind of, like, trying to stay away from the cats this week 'cause she doesn't -- she wants to ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  She's too attached as is it already so she's trying not to, like, pay attention to 'em because she knows that the doom --
R:  Right, she's gotta make -- g- -- doing the separation thing.
L:  The doom day is coming, so ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  But it's better for both of us.  We're too stressed out over animals.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  We fight more over animals than we do anything in real -- you know, of importance.
R:  Right, right. [LAUGH]
L:  About who's going to change the litter box, who's going to walk the dog at eleven o'clock at night, you know.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  So that's -- you know, it might be easier, hopefully on all of us.
R:  Yeah.  [MN] Well, I gu- ... well, the -- uh, since we've had -- we've gotten the lab, um, the -- the little dog's always kind of been my responsibility but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the lab, who's outside, he's out -- he has a kennel outside.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And of course he's training to be a hunting dog.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And [MN] [inaudible] that has to be my -- my husband's responsibility.  I couldn't take on the responsibility of another dog and so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, that was the understanding right from the get go --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- that, [SIGH] you know, y- -- somebody else -- I'm not going to care for it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And he has, and it's kind of, you know, it's been his [inaudible] that she -- he is definitely the master when it comes to that dog.  She doesn't listen to us, but --
L:  Yeah, that's how -- I mean, with --
R:  Hopefully maybe she'll get better when she's not a puppy, but ...
L:  Yeah, so that's how -- for the most part, that's how our dog is.
R:  Mhm.
L:  She -- you know, she's listens to mom somewhat, but when it comes to, you know, being feared -- being, you know, taught to be --
R:  Mhm.  The disciplinarian.
L:  Yeah, it -- it has to be dad --
R:  [inaudible] yeah.
L:  -- 'cause it's not -- she --
R:  That's funny you call her -- mom and dad.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, we kind of -- are that way with our dog.  I mean --
L:  Yeah, I mean --
R:  -- our dog has cousins.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  And my kids, when they count the kids in the family, they count the dog.
L:  Yep.
R:  And they say, "You know, there's more boys than girls in the family 'cause, you know, Obi's a boy" and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's kind of funny how they include ... more of -- more of the poodle than they do the lab.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  The lab's kind of too new and she's not in the house so they don't think about her, but --
L:  Yeah, so it's a little -- little distant.
R:  But that's funny 'cause w- -- [MN] but I grew up that way too, with -- my dad -- mom and dad always had poodles that slept in their bed and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so I kind of did that same thing too.  But we always talk about, "The dog's cousins and ..." [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, 'cause, uh --
R:  And stuff like that, so --
L:  When I bring the dog over to my girlfriend's parents, their -- they have a dog and that's -- that's -- that's her brother.  And, you know --
R:  Ah, tha- that's funny.
L:  Yeah, and that's his sister, so -- and that -- they're the grandparents, you know.
R:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
L:  That's how we say it.
R:  Do they have a good -- do they like the dog and they're pr- -- good about letting you bring it over and include it?
L:  They didn't at first 'cause it was -- they're used to, like -- they had a -- they have a English springer spaniel.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And when they got him from a f- -- different -- from a family member who d- -- has show dogs, 'cause that's what he was supposed to be but the colors didn't end up the right way.
R:  Yeah, mhm.
L:  They had trained him and brought him to, uh, obedience school for dog training, for the, uh -- [LIPSMACK] for show dogs.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So he was already calmed and disciplined.
R:  Oh.  Uh-huh.
L:  And then we bring this little rat over --
R:  That -- yeah.
L:  -- and all she wants to do is jump and run and, you know, cry --
R:  Stir up trouble.
L:  -- you know -- yes, start trouble.  So they're -- they were kind of like, "Get rid of the damned dog, get her out of here", you know.
R:  Yes.
L:  But then in the process of moving, my -- we -- my girlfriend had gone back home for uh, I guess, uh, two weeks or so.  So the dog stayed with her and they fell in love with her, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- now it's like when --
R:  After they kind of got used to her.
L:  Yeah, so now it's like, "When are you bringing the dog over?"  You know, they always want her over now.
R:  Well, that sounds -- my -- my -- my inlaws, when we go visit then -- they live about, mm, six hours away so we always end up taking the dogs and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  My mother in law doesn't -- doesn't like the dog, she's not a dog person at all and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and that for me always -- I mean, he runs up and sits right by her on the couch.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's like he knows and he's trying to make her suffer or something. [LAUGH]
L:  Yep, exactly.
R:  I don't know what it is.  And -- and she's -- she's nice to him, she's not mean to him or anything but, by golly, [MN] it's just so funny how he picks her to be the most friendly with.
L:  Yeah, yeah, exactly, mhm.
R:  And she [LAUGH] -- how c- -- it's almost like they know it and that there's --
L:  Yeah, they have some kind of keen sense about something.  They just --
R:  Yeah, I -- I don't know exactly what it is, but they're g- --
L:  Subliminal, something [LAUGH] that they just know.
R:  Pretty s- -- pretty smart.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, my, um, my si- --
