R:  [COUGH]
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] This is neat.  I'm Tammy.
R:  Hi, I'm Patty.
L:  Okay.  Um, what to look for in a life partner, huh?  [SIGH]  What do you look ...?
R:  I wasn't sure -- I wasn't sure what the subject was going to be as far as what they meant by a life partner.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, um, the question is what is important for you to look for in a life partner.
R:  Okay.  Man, woman or whatever?  Okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  Whatever.  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  'Cause usually when people re- refer to life partners it's usually a homosexual type --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- sit- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to me anyway that's what it meant.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But your husband can be your life partner too.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  That's true.
R:  What to look for in a life partner.
L:  Um --
R:  Oh, jeeze!  Well, what I looked --
L:  -- the most important thing to me ...
R:  -- what I looked for in a life partner and what I got were two different things.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  That happens a lot.
R:  Well, which it turned out to be for the better though --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- because when I was young and married my husband and I certainly didn't, uh, have high expectations, but they turned out to be a pretty good choice.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mine too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I know I look for trustworthiness the most.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  There's not enough of that nowadays.
L:  Yeah.  I think you have to trust them no matter what and ...
R:  Yeah.  Have somebody that has goals.
L:  Definitely.
R:  A little bit of money.  Not a lot.  [LAUGH]
L:  A little bit of money helps.  It helps.  Just a little.
R:  If they have goals and, um, dreams and a good job, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- then I think they can, uh --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- can make that.
L:  A job steady --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- is important.
R:  And whether they want children or not, you know?
L:  That's important to agree on that.
R:  It's important to me children.  [LAUGH]
L:  Definitely.  That's our child playing with our fax machine right now.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  [LAUGH]  Ours are grown.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, we're looking at grandkids now.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, funny.
R:  Yeah.  So [LIPSMACK] ...
L:  I also look a sense of humor --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because I think that if you don't have humor about some things you'll never make it.
R:  That's right.  That's right.
L:  And ...
R:  Ah, I'm trying to think.
L:  Ten minutes.  Okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  They don't have -- I mean, you know, fairly good looking.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, that helps.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, you gotta be able to stand to look at 'em in the morning when you wake up.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Um ...
R:  But, um --
L:  Let's see.
R:  -- I wouldn't expect 'em to not have their hair when they get older or some- -- you know --
L:  No.
R:  -- be skinny or whatever.
L:  No.
R:  You can't expect that.
L:  Definitely not.
R:  Man or wom- --
L:  There's so many expectations.
R:  -- man -- man or woman [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, that's for sure. 
R:  -- 'cause we certainly all change as we get older.
L:  Yes.  Yes.
R:  So ...
L:  Things change and ...
R:  Yeah, somebody that wants to spend time with you and --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  -- puts your feelings first, you know?
L:  Absolutely.  Someone you can talk to --
R:  Right.  Makes you ...
L:  -- and communicate with --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- because communication is --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- certainly one of the most important things you can have in a relationship I think.
R:  Sure.  Now it gets harder --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because I think we've covered all the ones that we ...  [LAUGH]
L:  All the major ones I know.  [LAUGH]
R:  And my age --
L:  I ...
R:  -- I know what, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what to look for, which is ...
L:  Yeah.  I think, uh, one thing that's important in qualities -- as far as qualities to look for [NOISE] -- and some qualities that you overlook --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is, uh -- I just -- I read thing today about somebody realizing that it's not so important that she has to wipe the toothpaste outta the sink --
R:  Right.
L:  -- after her husband has been in there.  But what's more important is that she married him for the qualities -- for other qualities --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they are what are more important --
R:  Right.
L:  -- than trivial things like having to clean up after him --
R:  Right.
L:  -- all the time.  So ...
R:  Not only that, but as you get older --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- then you realize that, you know, if you're -- say you're facing your spouse's death and the toothpaste in the sink isn't even, uh -- you wish --
L:  No.
R:  -- it would be there then.
L:  Yes.  Exactly.
R:  You know?  You would say --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- boy, give -- give that back to me --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- as much as I maybe complained about it, you know?
L:  Definitely.
R:  So, yeah, we don't -- I don't complain that much.
L:  Yeah, I try not to.
R:  I have too much.  [LAUGH]
L:  I try not to.  My ...
R:  Sometimes it's hard, but ...
L:  He works so much and --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- to provide for us, which I think that's important too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Someone who wants to provide and -- or if you can agree on a working situation that ...
R:  Right.  What your priorities are.
L:  Yes.  Exactly.
R:  You know, and then if you both have the same then that works out good.
L:  Mhm.  You have to have similar priorities with --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- everything.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean --
R:  Right.
L:  -- down to whether or not you'll home school your kids or not or ...
R:  Yeah.  Well, you can disagree and then you can just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- agree that you disagree.  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.
R:  That -- that seems to work for me anyway.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  Huh.
L:  Yeah, we do that sometimes.
R:  So, where you at?
L:  We are in Indiana.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Where ...?
R:  I'm not sure the lady was I talked to yesterday.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  We're in Pennsylvania.
L:  Pennsylvania, that's cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's cool.
R:  Yeah.  So ...
L:  So, you're -- you're right by the university then?
R:  Yes.
L:  Or at least in the same state.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  We have one in Lancaster.
L:  Okay.  That's great.
R:  A, uh -- but Penn State is at Harris --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, uh -- yeah, Penn State.  Yeah.
L:  That's neat.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  So, I've ...
L:  -- let's see, other important things about life partners.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, let's see.
R:  Mm, I guess they don't -- that they don't have any baggage, you know, as far as drinking --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or drugs or --
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- you know, anything --
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- that, you know, they're coming with, you know, that becomes a problem --
L:  Right.
R:  -- 'cause a lotta people I have that.  I think they have a lot of -- people that have to put up with something like that --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- which is sad.
L:  That tends to be a lotta problem as far as new marriages and well, I didn't know he drunk that much or --
R:  Right.  Or ...
L:  -- I didn't realize this was gonna be such a problem or ...
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  And, uh --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- respect, I think that's one thing we haven't talked about.
R:  Yeah, that's ...
L:  Um, you have to respect the other person and have them respect you --
R:  Right.
L:  -- as far as everything goes and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I think if they have enough respect for you then they wouldn't do things like, uh, invalidate the trust or --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- all those things.  I think it kinda ...
R:  Right.  I think if you talk about all this stuff before you get married then, you know, you get everything ironed out first --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and then you get married you don't get married and then say, uh-oh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- now this is for --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that better or for worse really meant [LAUGH] --
L:  Now it's for ever.
R:  -- really meant better -- better or worse [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- 'cause you think, you know, when you're walking down the aisle it's all gonna be good [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- and then the kids come.  [LAUGH]
L:  That first date's great.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh.
R:  And then the -- then you come back from the honeymoon and back to reality.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  One thing I don't necessarily think is important is I don't think you have to necessarily know your spouse for a long, long time before you marry them.  Um, I believe ...
R:  Oh, it helps.  But, yeah, I don't think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you have to, you know?
L:  I think you can get to know a person --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in a fairly short amount of time.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I'm trying to think.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, just that they're given a -- that they -- you know, you -- they w- -- that they're always working together, you're not working against each other.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Working together.
L:  Yes.  You need to ...
R:  Even no matter how hard it gets just ...
L:  Working towards a common goal --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and always working to [NOISE] get along.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And have [LAUGH] -- have somebody that wants to sit down too --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on a periodical basis and say, you know, this is our goals for now, you know, 'cause they change all the time.
L:  They do.
R:  You know?
L:  Everybody changes --
R:  Right.
L:  -- constantly.
R:  Right.  And just make sure that you're both on the same level.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you have to realize that people are gonna change too --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- 'cause --
R:  Right.
L:  -- especially women and our hormones.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.  Yeah.  Oh, you -- you're young.
L:  Yes.
R:  You sound young anyway.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're -- we're young.
R:  [MN] We're getting close to the big five O.  So, you know, I've --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you have a different idea of ...
L:  Of hormone changes.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm thinking --
R:  And -- and what you want in a husband too.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- of post pregnancy and ...
R:  Oh, boy!
L:  Oh. 
R:  I think I'm getting ready to go on the downside now.  So ...
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  We'll have to have a -- a partner that, uh -- that can go -- go with all these changes.
L:  Yes.
R:  Like you said, especially women.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Of course, men can too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Men can change too.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, they do.
R:  So ...
L:  They change in their own ways.
R:  Right.  Let's see.  I'm trying to think.  Kids and money and, oh ...
L:  Kids.  Money.  Religion can be an important factor --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- in a life partner --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- as far as agreeing on what you believe in --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- or agreeing not to agree --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or coming to some kind of agreement.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Especially when children come into the picture --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- as far as what you're going --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what religion you're going to have them --
L:  Right.
R:  -- pursue.  Yep.
L:  As far as if you're gonna raise them in church or not or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, uh --
R:  Right.
L:  -- people of like faiths tend to last a bit longer than those with unlike faiths I think.
R:  Right.  Right.  That would be true.  Yep.  Well, let's see.  I don't know.  We've covered pretty much everything that we --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that we know is important.
L:  Yeah.  Do they tell us when the ten minutes is up?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Have you done this?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  It does.  It gives you like a -- I think it gives -- gives you a beep and then it says, you know, you have thirty seconds to say good- --
