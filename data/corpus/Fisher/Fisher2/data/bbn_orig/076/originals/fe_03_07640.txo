L:  I'm Barbara.
R:  I'm Michelle.
L:  Oh.  Well, Michelle, I love my animals.  I have four cats and my sister has two dogs.
R:  Oh.  We have a dog and a hamster.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  And um so what does -- what does your uh dog look like?
R:  Um, she's a Border Collie.  She's black and white.
L:  Oh, really?  And does she have, like, a really cool personality?
R:  Um, yeah.  She's really good with kids and everything.  I -- I don't know, I never really bonded with her, though.  I used to have a Samoyed --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and um she was just gorgeous and she was kinda nasty though and she would get loose and she would chase all the kids and scare them.  So I ended up getting rid of her, but the -- the dog --
L:  [NOISE] turn it down.
R:  -- I have now is more for my -- my daughter, you know?  It's her baby.  So I want to get a dog now, but it's gonna be my baby.  
L:  Yeah.  I know what you mean.
R:  Yeah.  I want a Great Pyrenees.  Do you know what they are?
L:  Um, aren't those the little ones with the fluffy, bushy tails?
R:  Um --
L:  And they're small?
R:  No, that's -- um, you might be thinking of a Pomeranian?
L:  Oh, yeah, that sounds like, you know -- 
R:  Yeah, I want a Great Pyrenees.  They look like a white Saint Bernard.
L:  Oh.
R:  They're gorgeous.
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  Yeah.  So -- what kind of cats do you have?
L:  Well, I have -- I have the coolest cats.  They have like the coolest personalities.  They all have their own individual ones.  I have one cat that we call Horatio.
R:  Mhm?
L:  And he's named after somebody famous, but I'm not sure who because they were my boyfriend's parents' cats.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And they lived in an apartment and they had to get rid of all of them and they loved me, so I said I'd take 'em, and my boyfriend, you know, 'cause it's their son, so we took 'em all.  Um, and uh Horatio is all black and white.  He looks like a cow kitty.
R:  Oh.
L:  He's funny, 'cause he won't eat any human food but tuna.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, he won't eat any human food.  Then I have a cat named Bonaparte who he's Napoleon Bonaparte, he's also named after somebody famous.  Now, keep in mind that all these cats that I have, except for one of them, were all fed by a bottle by his mom.
R:  Wow.
L:  So they're really gentle, they're really sweet and they're really funny.
R:  Oh.
L:  But Horatio -- um, Bonaparte, he's really funny.  He's like all grey with like a little bit of white paws, but he's got one foot in the back that looks like a rabbit's foot.
R:  Oh.
L:  And he's just so cute.  I -- I don't want to take over the whole conversation [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, no, that's okay.
L:  But I mean, my cats are like the greatest cats.  I love 'em.  And then I have an all black one named Blackie.  I love him.  He's got beautiful green eyes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, he's fun- he's funny.  He's just really, really a funny cat.  Like, he'll go outside, but then he'll jump over the fence, but he won't -- he'll meow on the other side of the neighbor's fence, so I can go over there and jump over and pick him up, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And bring him back over.  He's weird, and then um I have a cat named Charlotte.  We call her Charlotte -- Charlotte Paws Mitten, because she's got five -- five fingers, I think -- is it six or five, Mike?  Mike?  How many paws does Charlotte have?  Six or five?  She has five.  And that's abnormal for a cat.  Usually they only have four. 
R:  You mean five toes?
L:  Yeah, five toes.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Wow.
L:  It's cute.  She looks like she has a little hand.
R:  Oh [LAUGH].
L:  Little -- little mittens.  That's why we call her Mittens also.  And then have you seen Charlotte's Web?
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know the spider, how they have the really pretty black, beady eyes?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Charlotte?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, that's what our cat had when she was a baby, when she was a kitten, our kitten.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Her eyes looked like that and they kinda still look like that a little bit, but they're a different color so we call -- started calling her Charlotte, and then my boyfriend calls her Pickles.  I don't know why he --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- calls her Pickles.
R:  Oh.
L:  He calls her Little Pickles and I just love her.  And then we have -- what other cat?  We have Horatio, Blackie -- Horatio, Blackie, Bonaparte and Charlotte, and they're just the coolest cats.  I love 'em.
R:  They're short haired?
L:  I'm taking over the whole conversation.
R:  That's okay.  They're short haired?
L:  All short hair, yes.
R:  And they're all, like, brother and sister, then?
L:  Yeah.  Sort of kind of.  Um, Horatio, Blackie and Bonaparte all grew up together and they were fed by bottles.  Um, Bonaparte was given to Mike's mom, um, by a -- by some kids in the neighborhood and also Horatio and also Blackie.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They were all given to his mom and she fed 'em by bottles.  But like, she's like -- when she has kittens, you know, and they grow up, she kinda wants to give them away because she doesn't want them any more kind of thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, 'cause she likes the kittens and the puppies.
R:  Mm.
L:  Now she's got a puppy, after we have all these cats.  She's got --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- the puppy.
R:  Oh.
L:  But plus she's got Cleo, which she's uh blind in one eye and then she's -- we got another cat named Moulder that my boyfriend found when he was doing construction.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And actually found two cats, two kittens.  Unfortunately, one died and the other one survived.  It's all black and has like the cutest little personality and his mom has that one.  And then there's a big cat named Carlton.  He's all orange.  Really huge, but he always hides under the bed.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah, it's weird, and then let's see.  Oh yeah, and then there's Simba, which is Charlotte's brother and we were supposed to take him with us, but his mom wouldn't let -- wouldn't part with him.
R:  Oh.  
L:  So I ended up leaving Simba there, but really pretty cat.  And there was another one that we called Stacey, I think, and we gave her away also.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But just really great cats.  You know, I had to help the mom actually have birth with her babies 'cause um she's a young cat.  The first bir- um, first -- first litter she had, she um -- two of kit- two kittens died, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- she only had two, but they were, like really, really skinny.  And then we were going to take them, but his mom ended up wanting to keep 'em and then she ended up giving them all away and then -- then Sonic had another baby.  And uh -- or, more babies, but her other two died.  And then Charlotte -- Charlotte, Simba and Stacey -- actually, one died.  Charlotte, Simba and Stacey all survived, but I had to help her, like, pull them out of her.
R:  Mhm.  Wow.
L:  So what other pets do you have, you said?
R:  We have a hamster.
L:  And what's your hamster like?
R:  Oh, well, it's my daughter's.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  It's just a cream colored short hair.  She named him Cheddar.  
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Our dog's name is Zowie.  
L:  Oh, yeah.  What do they do?  I mean, what -- how are they --
R:  The hamster?
L:  Yeah?
R:  Oh --
L:  I mean, do they have, like, per- does he have a personality and --
R:  Well, we got him when he was really little, so he wasn't -- he wasn't friendly at all when we got him, but since he was so small, we worked with him every day.  Now he's really friendly, but the dog always tries to eat him.  
L:  Oh, no.  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Got to be careful with that, 'cause um we had a white Siberian Husky --
R:  Oh, they're gorgeous.
L:  Gorgeous, gorgeous dog.
R:  Oh, I love them.
L:  And we also had a beautiful white small long haired kitten.
R:  Oh.
L:  And the kitten, to the Siberian Husky, looked like a pup -- looked like a stuffed animal, 'cause --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- she used to play with stuffed animals, and of course one day, you know, we knew that the pup -- dog was gonna to get a hold of the kitten one day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We were hoping it wouldn't.  It got a hold of it.  It was playing with it like it was a stuffed animal so it was like throwing it around when it had it by the neck and we didn't know and we got home, oh, it was horrible.
R:  Huskies always kill cats.
L:  Oh, I was so mad.
R:  I had a Husky that killed a kitten before.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  What color was it?  White also?
R:  It was black and white.  I -- I --
L:  Oh, what --
R:  I always wanted a white one, they're gorgeous.  
L:  Yeah.  I love -- I love her.  What happened, her name was Cass, she -- I mean, it was my sister's boss's dog and he just didn't have time for her and my sister had kids and she had a condo and a little back yard so it was good for Cassie to be there.  One day, you know, I just let her go outside for like twenty minutes by herself, and my sister usually does that, and she comes right back, but somebody took her.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  Somebody took her, so --
R:  Oh, they stole her?
L:  Yeah, someone stole her.
R:  Oh.
L:  Twenty minutes, someone stole her.  I couldn't believe it.
R:  That's -- yeah.
L:  And then I used to have a cat named Aaron and he was all white and he was really cool.  And he liked to sit in cars and my sister's ex wanted to take him to the preschool or the kids -- the preschool and he was in the car and he jumped out and I was on a movie shoot, I never got to see him again.
R:  A movie shoot?
L:  Yeah, I was on um -- um, I do a little bit of um extra work and I was on Evolution.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, and it ran for, like, sixteen hours about.
R:  Wow.
L:  And um we were there for sixteen hours.  I came home.  My cat was gone, looking all over for my cat.  Had him for thirteen years.  Great cat.
R:  Oh.
L:  Never got to see him again.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah, it made me sad.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I think it's cool that the topic was about pets 'cause I love mine.
R:  Yeah, me too.  
L:  [LAUGH] I love my pets.
R:  Yeah.  I had a bunch of Persians and Himalayans and I --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, they're my favorite.  I love long haired cats.
L:  And what happened to them?
R:  Oh, I decided back in December to just get rid of them.  I got tired of taking care of the long hair --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because they would always get matted and they shed everywhere and it was just too much for me after a while.  Plus, you know, they would fight and --
L:  Oh, wow. 
R:  -- the white -- 
L:  How many did you have?
R:  I -- um, I had six.  
L:  Six?
R:  Yeah.  I had a white Persian and his eyes were always running, so his face was always a mess.
L:  Oh.
R:  Plus when he would eat and he'd have -- my call waiting's gone off, sorry.  Any time he --
L:  It's okay.
R:  -- would eat, he would get -- you know, his beard all in the food and --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- I'd practically have to give him a bath and he was always getting poop stuck to his butt and it -- it was just too much for me so I finally decided to get rid of the cats.
L:  Oh.
R:  But I kinda miss having a cat around, though.
L:  Yeah, they're -- they're great companions.  And like people -- people -- some people, a lot of people, don't think that animals understand you.  
R:  Yeah, they do.
L:  But they do.  Like, my one cat, Napoleon, or Bonaparte, whatever we call him --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he totally understands me.  He talks to me even and people trip out because they think I'm crazy because I'm saying --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- that my cat understands me.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But all our cats understand us and they do talk to us.  Except for Horatio.  He's kinda -- my boyfriend thinks that Horatio's kind of stupid.
R:  Oh.
L:  He -- he's just stupid 'cause he just -- he just, like, sits there and just stares at something, you know what I mean?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And he doesn't really have much of a --
