L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, this is Kelly.
R:  My name is Jim.  I live in Oklahoma.
L:  Oh, okay.  I live in Texas.
R:  Well, nice to meet you.
L:  Yeah, nice to meet you too.  W- -- so what do you look for in a life partner?
R:  Oh, well, I- I'm on, uh, my third wife right now.  My first two marriages didn't, you know, work out too well.  My first wife was mentally ill.
L:  Oh, she was [inaudible] --
R:  Yeah, so that was -- 
L:  [inaudible] rough.
R:  That was bad.  But I was with her for, uh, eighteen years.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And, uh, you know, looking back.  I'm fifty two years old.  Looking back on -- on what to look for, uh, I probably would have done it differently.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Did you know before you got married that she had mental problems?
R:  No.
L:  No, it -- it just came up after.
R:  It didn't come on until, uh, she was about twenty two.
L:  Yeah, yeah, that can be very rough.  Does she -- is she okay now?
R:  Yeah, she's all right.
L:  Gee, that's good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Good.  So, you're -- what you look for in a life partner has probably changed over the last --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- thirty years or so, huh.
R:  Yeah.  My wife now is, uh, real good to talk to.  She's, uh, more, uh, intelligent.  My first wife was -- was not, uh, on my same level.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, we didn't have a lot of things to talk about.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I just basically went by the way she looked.  She looked real good.
L:  Yeah, but boy hadn't that -- I know, that is small relative to, you know, as far as being compatible and I agree, you know, I watch all these reality shows.  I just think, "Oh, there's so much more --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- then, you know, just the looks because you have to live with this person [LAUGH] every day."  I have been married for, um, six years, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to my husband and he's great.  He is -- he -- like you said, he is real easy to talk to and we have a lot of the same interests.  That's been great, um, because we enjoy each other's company.
R:  Yeah, that makes all the difference.
L:  Yeah, that does and, um, you know, he's real easy going and I'm not as easy going so it works out good that he can kinda, you know, if I'm upset about something just kinda keep the peace so that's worked out good for us.
R:  [MN] Mhm.  Yeah, in our relationship I'm kind of the -- the one that will, uh, be slower to, uh, you know, react.  I'm pretty laid back.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, something's got to really be a crisis before I'm gonna even say hardly anything.  [LAUGH] We have, uh, five kids.
L:  Oh, you have five, wow.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Through a wh- [MN] -- like some from your previous marriages and she have some from previous marriages or five together.
R:  Yeah.  W- we have, uh, she has three from two +previous -- previous marriages and I have my own son that -- that he's mentally ill.  He's twenty four --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then we have our boy together.  Er, he's three.
L:  MM, oh, good.  Whoa --
R:  So we have --
L:  -- what a big span.
R:  -- a twenty four year old, a seventeen, eight, uh, then three.
L:  Oh, wow.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  We have a house full.
L:  [LAUGH] You do have a house full.  That's funny.  That's a big range.  Well, I just have one.  I have a two year old little girl so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, so I know how active they are at this age.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Um, so anyway -- so your three year old's a little boy?
R:  Yeah, he's three and we babysit for a one year old --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- little girl.
L:  Oh, so you're busy.  So you, um, do you work?  You retired?
R:  I'm retired from Safeway and I --
L:  Oh, good.
R:  -- uh, buy and sell stuff on Ebay and, uh, do odd jobs, that kind of thing.
L:  Oh, wow.  So you worked at Safeway for a bunch of years and ?
R:  Yeah, I worked there from the time I was sixteen until I was almost forty.
L:  Oh, wow.  And was able to retire young, huh?
R:  Well, I've been retired, uh, for about six years.
L:  Wow.
R:  So I wasn't even -- let's see, I'm fifty two now, so I was like [NOISE] forty six when I retired.
L:  Yeah, wow.  So then you just do stuff on Ebay?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  Well good.  Well then what --
R:  And stuff like this.  Take surveys and that kind of thing.
L:  Yes, I know.  You do all that stuff on the Internet?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  So do I, erm --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I stay home with my little girl so it's nice to have a little extra income.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Does you wife work?
R:  Oh, she does the daycare and she --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- helps me with the -- the things I do.
L:  Right.
R:  And, uh, we mow yards, once in a while she helps with that.
L:  Right, good, so you kinda have --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- an entrepreneurial spirit, huh?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, we -- we just bought a new home last year [NOISE] and we've just had a lot of good luck.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I had an older camaro.  I had an eighty one Z. twenty eight that was, I guess it was getting to be a classic.  I'd been driving that thing for ten years and I sold it on Ebay a couple of weeks ago for thirty five hundred bucks.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Twenty two year old car.
L:  Wow, so there's things like that that anyh- -- barely cost anything.
R:  No, I mean if you --
L:  Drive it.
R:  -- I drove it for ten years.  I paid two thousand for it and I probably -- oh, repairs and everything I did to it probably didn't add up to over four thousand over the ten year period.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  So, then --
R:  -- I drove a car for ten years for six thousand dollars.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then sold if for thirty five hundred.
L:  Yeah, that's great.  That's great.  So good.  You just see how -- you kinda have good money sense like that.  So you really like Ebay a lot?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I buy [MN] some stuff on there like, um, gift certificates for restaurants and stuff.  I like, you know -- you can get pretty good deals --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, stuff like that so   Well, good then what happ- -- where's your second wife?
R:  Uh, she's in, uh -- her name was Margaret.  Well, it still is Margaret.  I guess she's still alive.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  She was a kinda of a run around kinda woman.  I met her when I lived in Kingman, Arizona --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, uh, she was very nice, ver- very friendly, good personality.  She's heavy.
L:  Heavy.  [LAUGH]
R:  She's overweight and -- and but pretty.  And I thought, "Well, she's really nice and she seems to -- to like me" and all that so we got married.  And then it turned out that she'd slept with like half the town.  You know --
L:  Oh, 
R:  -- this h- overweight woman.  I couldn't figure that out.  I still don't get it.
L:  Oh, all these men were light.  Really?  She must [inaudible] by her personality, huh?
R:  Well, she was not unattractive.  You -- you'd think of -- she weighed two hundred and twenty five pounds.  You'd think --
L:  Oh, goodness.
R:  "My God".  But she didn't look that bad.  She was cute.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah, she --
R:  She was a -- she was cute.
L:  She carried it well.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Anyway you've done all this stuff after you got married?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh, so you've had some -- some life lessons, huh?
R:  Oh, yeah.  I've had [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- had some tough ones.  I'm surprised I didn't get any diseases from her.
L:  Yeah, so that --
R:  But I didn't.  I'm -- I'm okay.
L:  Yeah, so was that a short marriage?
R:  Uh, three years.
L:  Oh, three.  Wow, that's still pretty long.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  You just starting find --
R:  I've been married three years on -- on this one.
L:  Oh, and in this third one.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, this one seems to be going --
R:  Th- this -- if this one doesn't make it, that's gonna be it for me.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm not gonna get married again.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, so, what did you find in this one that was different from the others?  Did you say you had a lot more in common with her?
R:  Well, yeah.  But I really know that.  Again I went for the -- the looks and it just worked out good.
L:  Yeah, really?
R:  It -- it turned out that she could cook and she -- she wasn't a runaround and she liked to stay home and -- and you know, I could have messed this one up too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it worked out good.
L:  It worked out good so hopefully --
R:  I was lucky.
L:  -- hopefully this'll be it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I'm hoping this'll be it.  I know you can change a lot.  I got married pretty young.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [inaudible] I know you can change a lot.  But I have a really, you know, good faithful husband so I'm glad because that is -- that is the most important, you know, if they stay faithful and stuff.  'Cause if you don't have that trust, you know, it's hard to have anything else.  
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  If you're --
R:  Oh, yeah
L:  If you're always think --
R:  Once -- once you catch them lying to you, then -- then, uh --
L:  You just get --
R:  -- you gotta wonder about anything that they say.
L:  Yeah.  So, it's like that, em, you know -- that's definitely one of the most important things --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I have found and, yeah, just that he's a real good listener and, you know, he can take and he just supports me.  You know, like things like this.  [LAUGH] I mean, all my little, um, Internet surveys and all that.  I mean, I do a lot of that when he's a- around so he could --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, d- is there a market research up there too?  Do you have market research where you go for focus groups and stuff?  Do you all have that in Oklahoma?
R:  Ah, where you actually go?
L:  Yeah, go to the place and --
R:  No --
L:  -- sit in a focus group.
R:  -- I haven't done that yet.  I just kind of recently got started.  All I've -- all I've been doing now is -- is Greenfield and, uh, this, what we're doing now.
L:  Oh, is Greenfield, is that a site, um, um, online?
R:  It's Greenfield Online.  They do research --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- they -- surveys and they pay you, like whatever, a dollar, two dollars or whatever.  I don't know how long it takes.  I haven't even got paid anything yet so it must take a while before they pay you.
L:  Yeah, that is kinda -- yeah, I think this one takes a couple of months to get paid too.
R:  Mhm.  Now this one right here.  They told me it was three calls.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Does that mean it's over?  Or does that mean we can keep, uh ?
L:  No, then you're done.  Is this your third call?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, then you're done.  You'll get your thirty dollars --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but I don't think you can do any more calls.
R:  Mm, well I may have to -- I may try to do it again or have my wife do it.
L:  Yeah, yeah, have your wife do it.  She can --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- call and register and, um, I think really anybody, um, and you may -- can refer her and then she can get a referral off you.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think.  That's what [several inaudible words].  He went to questions yesterday when I called to register.  This is my second call.  And, em, she said, "Yeah, that you could refer others and stuff."
R:  Okay, well I'll tell her about that.
L:  Yeah, so it's easy money, I know.  Yes.
R:  Yeah, but, um, you know the sub-- getting back to the subject, I think --
