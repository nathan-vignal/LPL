R:  Hello, my name is Amy Esti.
L:  Uh, Gary Prosceus calling.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Hi, Gary.  So, do you watch TV sports?
L:  Um, well, uh, only because, um, see the home team Pittsburgh, um, Steelers, and, uh, that's about it.  Steelers when they're in the playoffs.
R:  Only when they're in the playoffs?
L:  Basically. 
R:  [LAUGH] So, mo- mostly football.  You watch basketball?  Or hockey?  Or --
L:  You know what, I did.  Yo- -- the -- funny you should mention that.  The University of Pittsburgh, they were in the sweet sixteen and they were -- boy they just played up their favorability here in -- in Pittsburgh to go to this -- the eight -- the sweet eight or whatever they call that.
R:  That sweet sixteen; is that the college ball?
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I was never interested in that until they got to the, uh, sweet sixteen for the second year in a row, and then they were really favored to go on.  And then -- then -- then they just -- they just petered out.
R:  [LAUGH] B- but didn't make it quite all the way.  Kinda --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- like our Lakers.  I'm from Los Angeles.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, that's right, you lost, uh, I mean, I guess you were as -- you were as --
R:  Andox[?].  [LAUGH] And our Angels.  But what is -- what was it, the Angels or the Dodgers that won the pennant last year?
L:  Um --
R:  [LIPSMACK] [inaudible] 
L:  -- boy, [inaudible]. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I know the Yankees were in there somewhere.
R:  [LAUGH] Remember as they most always are.  They probably are the most consistent winners --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I would say probably nationwide.
L:  Follow the money trail.
R:  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Now I haven't, um, I don't watch a lot of TV sports but, um, because I -- where I work there's actually a lot of the off season sport players here.  And so I actually go to the live games.  So, like, the arena football league, um, will live here, and so I'll go and see them perform at the Staple Center.  Now we have the WMBA, the, um, Los Angeles Sparks, the female basketball players.  Um, the Los Angeles Kings, the --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- hockey team stays here.  Um, all during --
L:  You must see something every day there?
R:  Yeah, it is -- it is.  It's quite exciting.  And you get to meet all the players I get to know them.  There's -- I can't pronounce his name, but he's a boxer.  He's playing, um, he's competing against, Len- Leonard Lennox, right -- right -- Leonard --
L:  Lennox Lewis.
R:  Lennox Lewis, on Saturday, at Staples.  I don't know.
L:  Wow!
R:  Anyway he's living here.  [LAUGH] And all of his sparring partners and mates --
L:  [LAUGH] He's got a site, uh, at Georgia bar them?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Perhaps before I was here [LAUGH] he frequented the Oakwood.  But, um, but I have heard a lot of talk about the, um, the increase usage of watching the college sports and how much more exciting it is watching college basketball and college football --
L:  If you have a home team that's involved --
R:  -- than perhaps the professional sports.
L:  -- it -- it -- it's -- it really is.
R:  Well, it's more also seeing same people I think at the beginning of their talent --
L:  And it's the purest form of the sport.
R:  -- I mean, if you -- if you looked at, Shaquille O'Neil, you know, four years ago as to today, there's an incredible difference as to his, you know, endurance and flexibility and I mean, the -- the guy is enormous --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- absolutely huge.  And the fact that he can actually run up and down that court for the whole [LAUGH] game is astounding to me.  So, and s- [LAUGH] it's just incredible what -- the advancements they can do.
L:  Well, the -- I don't know how well UCLA did but our -- our coach was, uh, he was supposed to go out there and, uh, and you know, he had a, um, [LIPSMACK] a, uh, bid for the, uh, coaching job at UCLA there.
R:  Very good.
L:  But, um, I guess -- I don't know if he got it or not but, uh, there was a thing about him, you know, just being dis- distracted by that while Pitt was in the playoffs for that, um --
R:  Yeah, that actually does sound familiar.  Is he a black gentleman?
L:  [LIPSMACK] No, no.  It was, uh, Ben Holland[?].  And, uh --
R:  Okay, 'cause I could have sworn there was some -- which is k- -- which is kind of on.  I wasn't necessarily paying attention to it but it was pictures of, Pat O'Reilly, right?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, [several inaudible words] 
R:  [several inaudible words] if I get these names all right I'm --
L:  Are you from LA originally?
R:  Um, yeah.  
L:  Okay.
R:  Well, from Orange County.  Just the -- the next southernmost county.
L:  Well, if -- if, uh, you're old enough, mayb- -- I don't know if, um, to be interested in the college ball, but that's a pure -- p- -- more pure form, you know, instead of the pro -- professional because of the, uh, the lack of showmanship that -- that's involved.  And, uh --
R:  Correct.  Correct.  That's why I think that there's a -- a more increased watching of college sports on TV versus the professional sports.  It's almost become predictable; these incredible athletes, these, you know, superstars, these dream teams that they, you know, it's almost -- [PAUSE] almost boring, you know.  I mean, they're so good [LAUGH] that it's almost, yeah, yeah, yeah, another three pointer.  
L:  [MN] 
R:  So, you know, whereas college ball, it's kind of more of a such a wider mix of people or I don't know, but it's just more entertaining to really see --
L:  It's more innocent and less, you know, less --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- cluttered by the ego.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And the money and the Hollywood and everything.
R:  [NOISE] Ah, yeah.
L:  And the commercial interest.
R:  I'd have to agree with that but it's just more, you know, that they're college kids.  These kids are still going to school, these kids are still finding themselves.  These kids are still, you know, calling mom and dad.  [LAUGH]
L:  What was your name again.
R:  My name is Amy.
L:  Amy.  And how old are you Amy if I may ask?
R:  I'm thirty three.
L:  Okay, I'm fifty actually [several inaudible words]. 
R:  What was your name again?
L:  Gary.  And, um, [LIPSMACK] boy I've never been out past Chicago, let alone ...
R:  Ah, I've always wanted to go to Chicago.  I work for the Oakwood Apartments and they, um, have an -- an apartment complex there.  But I think we're supposed to keep on TV basketball.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, right.  Ah, really.  [several inaudible words].  
R:  Have you -- did you ever, um, play a sport?
L:  Uh, w- -- sure.  I've -- I've played 'em all but -- except hockey.  And, uh, yeah, actually my, uh --
R:  Isn't it cold enough there in -- in Pittsburgh to do hockey?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, well, um, you know, they have the indoor, yeah, they have the indoor high school and the -- of course the professional Penguins and everything but, um, I guess sport -- I want to put a plug in for table tennis.  That's a m- -- the most exciting forgotten sport; table tennis and it's so cardio vascular.
R:  I -- I lo- -- I love playing table tennis.  Don't think they have it on TV very often.
L:  They don't.  And it's Olympic sport and it's so under- --
R:  There's, you know, a thousand channels, and nothing to watch.
L:  Isn't it pathetic?
R:  But they don't [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:   -- they -- but they'll rerun those MTV shows or those real life scenario, survivor type shows over and over and over again and all the different things.  I've seen, um, [LIPSMACK] um, pool -- billiards on TV.  I've actually flip- --
L:  Right.  They have women doing that very well.
R:  Yeah.  And I've been -- I've been [inaudible] flipping through the channels seeing -- seeing those sports but --
L:  I want to see the, uh, low cut, you know, low cut tops doing that.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  'Cause that's the perfect --
R:  Just for TV.
L:  -- sport for that.  Yeah.
R:  Just for TV.  Just for those TV viewers to get -- get that correct camera angle there.
L:  Oh, man.
R:  Try to increase those ratings, you know.  Gotta show some T and A.
L:  Ratings!  Oh, really.
R:  Ye- -- well, which [several inaudible words] on the -- with the basketball shorts so they go past their knees.  What's up with that?
L:  What?
R:  You never even get to see any thigh any more.  All the -- all the sports people -- the basketball players, they don't have, like, shorts.  They have -- they're almost like --
L:  Oh, they're like culottes.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Like capri pants or something.  I mean, they're past their knees.  They wear --
L:  Yeah.  Well, that's more comfortable I guess, you know.
R:  I know, it's, uh, you know why don't -- why don't men show their thighs any more?
L:  And just come out in jock straps, you know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  It, well, [MN] there's a huge difference between [LAUGH] capris and jock straps.  There's, you know, a whole different --
L:  What's a capri?  I never even heard that term.
R:  Capris; I mean, they're just like any pant that would be longer than your knee and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- shorter than your ankle.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Like, so be hitting anywhere in the calf region.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mm.
R:  But that would be --
L:  Well, you know what though, we have, uh, a regional tournament once a year; they have, uh, regional table tennis tournaments.  So, look for those [several inaudible words] tournaments out your way.
R:  You think [several inaudible words] will be televised.
L:  Well, I mean, just for per- participation.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  They're for you to participate in.
R:  I haven't played in a really long time.  We used to have one in the garage.  
L:  [several inaudible words]. 
R:  And it was always kinda fun to --
L:  It's a great sport for any age and it's so cardio vascular at a -- at a skill level, you know.
R:  Well, yeah, at a -- at a skill level I would definitely say that.  For us it was more of a drinking game.
L:  And basketball's another thing.  That's -- that's the other great, simple sport you can play, even by yourself.  I mean, that's the -- the greatest sport you can play by yourself to, uh --
R:  You like table tennis, I can tell.
L:  Great.  But I mean, basketball is -- to play even by yourself is such a cardio vascular workout.
R:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.
L:  And then that -- and that's the most ready made, um, uh, availability for, uh, all your local court, uh, you know --
R:  Absolutely.  
L:  School court, gymnasium, anything.
R:  There's always a local court, you know, not too far away.  Always at whatever playground or rec center or ...
L:  So, you're in the -- the, uh, property management?  Or ...
R:  Um, that is the company that I work for.  I'm actually their activities director.  So, I actually just plan all the fun.
L:  Oh, my.
R:  My job is to make sure that they have a good time while they live here.
L:  Is it an -- an upscale or a senior retirement?  What is it? 
R:  Um, it's upscale corporate housing.  Fully furnished corporate housing.
L:  Oh, my goodness!
R:  And -- and so, they're just here temporarily.  And we- -- all the units are furnished.  We're kind of like an extended stay hotel.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh.  [MN] 
R:  And so, whether they're here for three days, three months, three years, I'm here to make sure they feel like they're part of a community and feel at home.  And --
L:  My goodness!
R:  -- that they just have a wonderful stay.
L:  Well, see we don't have anything like that over here.
R:  Sure you do.  There's Oakwoods out there.
L:  Really?
R:  Absolutely.  We're nationwide.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] We're -- we're not really silicone valley oriented yet.  But, uh --
R:  Yeah.  No, but even that has, um, demised quite a bit.  The silicone valley has almost but shut down.
L:  I mean, corporate housing; that's -- that's sort of a foreign terminology n this part of the country.
R:  Well, what's your profession?
L:  I labor.
R:  Doing?
L:  [LAUGH] Just, uh, yo- you're raw labor, uh, whatever it is.
R:  So, construction or whether --
L:  Great.  Whatever I'm called to do.
R:  Whatever you're called to do.  [LAUGH] So, multi talented be- -- you know --
L:  Right.
R:  Well, I would definitely think a laborer would be, um, watching all kinds of sports by stereotypical standards.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, my -- my -- my -- my, uh, um, [LIPSMACK] --
