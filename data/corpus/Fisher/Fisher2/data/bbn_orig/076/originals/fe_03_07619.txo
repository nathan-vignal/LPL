L:  Cara[?].
R:  Michael.  Hi, Cara.
L:  Hi, Michael, how are you?
R:  Fine, thanks.  This is my first call and my first, uh, [LAUGH] conversation with this.
L:  Oh, well, it -- I've done one other and this conversa- -- this topic is a lot [LAUGH] better than the first one I did.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  This is easy for me, to talk about my pets. [LAUGH]
R:  Wh- what was it last time?
L:  Um, oh, it was, uh, minimum wage, what you thought about minimum wage, and I had no idea.  But I got through it --
R:  Good job.
L:  -- okay.  So, anyway, do you have any pets?
R:  I have had a pet recently die.
L:  Oh, I'm sorry.
R:  And I do have one eighteen year old cat who's just my pride and joy, really.
L:  Oh.
R:  I'm looking, in fact, at two pictures of her right now.  How about you, do you have any pets?
L:  I have a dog.  Um, she's five and her name is Dixie.  Um --
R:  Em, what kind of mix i- is Dixie?
L:  She's a chihuahua dachshund mix. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, how cute.
L:  She's adorable.  She doesn't -- her face looks like -- a lot of people say she doesn't look like a chihuahua at all, um, and I think a lot of [LAUGH] chihuahuas can be ugly, but she's adorable.  She's all black and has a little white muzzle and little white paws.
R:  Is she a, like, a house cat or do y- -- or a house dog?  Do you take her outside?
L:  Y- -- um, she -- she go- -- yes, she goes outside.  She actually goes hiking, um, and she swims, she's great.  She loves the outdoors and, uh, she's really active.  Um, but she can't -- she's actually right now under the covers [LAUGH] next to me. [LAUGH] She --
R:  So you're at home right now?
L:  Yeah, I'm home right now, yeah.
R:  Where are you -- wh- where are you right now?  What city, what state?
L:  Um, I live, um, outside of San Francisco.
R:  Oh, I'm in Los Angeles.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And I'm at work. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, got it --
R:  At lunchtime.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I'm going to work soon.  But, um, anyway, so h- -- what's your cat's name?
R:  Bangyls.  But it's a weird spelling.  Um, when I first got her I said, "She's my angel", which is A.N.G.E.L. --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but I just put a B. in front of that and called her Bangel, and then I put a Y. instead of the, uh, E. --
L:  Oh --
R:  You know, kind of like a funky spelling --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, like -- [LAUGH] so --
L:  What kind of cat is she?
R:  She's just a tortoise hair.  She's a short haired tortoise cat.  Very bright.  You know, these animals that -- I'm sure your animal too, they can be very bright.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Surprisingly.  I don't know if people realize that -- tho- those that don't have pets.
L:  Yeah, they can -- and I mean you hear about, um, [LIPSMACK] pe- -- you know, pets who -- who rescue -- what did I -- oh, a pig.  I recently heard someone had a pig and, um, a woman was having a heart attack and she told her pig, "Go out and get someone", and the pig ran outside, went in the middle of the road, played dead so someone would stop.  Someone s-, like, stopped in the middle of the road and the -- as soon as the person got out of the car, the pig jumped up, ran into the house and the person followed it and found the woman.  But --
R:  Amazing.
L:  Yeah, amazing.  I mean, pe- -- animals are just really smart.  I think they have, you know, intuition and they're just -- yeah, my -- my dog is really [LAUGH] smart.  Um, yeah, animals are just amazing.
R:  [SIGH] You know, I know we're -- we're talking about dogs but it raises the other question: okay, then why do we, you know, consume them, [LAUGH] you know, but --
L:  Right.  Well, right.
R:  You know, that ... um, you know, when my cat recently died I wasn't sure what they do to them.  I took her to the -- took him to the, [LIPSMACK] uh, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] the pet place over here, where you adopt pets and -- et cetera.  And I called to find out what do they do with them.  You know, they render pets.
L:  What's that?
R:  They sell them to, like, processing plants and they put 'em in a big vat and they heat 'em [LAUGH] up and they --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- extract their oils and --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- their fur.  Yeah, but that's what happens to all the road kill and all the -- the animals that are -- are picked up by the city and the state.  That's --
L:  Really?
R:  Yep, true story. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my -- so is that what happened to your cat?
R:  Yep, yep.
L:  So -- but ca- --
R:  So I said to myself, "If I could do it again I think I'm -- would probably have it cremated, if -- knowing --"
L:  [MN]
R:  "-- what would happen".
L:  R- right, yeah, a lot of people that I know do cremate their animals and -- or bury 'em.  I know, um, my boyfriend's parents, um -- or grandparents buried both of their dogs in the backyard.  Um --
R:  I don't know if I would do that.  That would be ...
L:  M- -- [LAUGH] a little weird.
R:  I- if I ever left the house I would wanna go back there, you know, and ... y- you know, 'cause I do, I have a -- an apartment, I own it.  And I thought about burying him back there but I said, "Well, what if I sell the building?"  You know, [LAUGH] am I gonna have to, like, always haunt myself, "I gotta go back there and sneak back there just to get my wishes?"
L:  Yeah, that would be a little weird.
R:  Well ...
L:  A little weird.  But I'm sorry about your loss.  How old was your cat?
R:  You know what? I -- I don't feel so badly 'cause --
L:  Oh, good.
R:  -- this cat lived eighteen years.
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  A really rich live, you know, a house cat and --
L:  Bu- -- and your other cat's eighteen?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, wow.  Were they -- did you get 'em at the same time?
R:  I think -- th- -- six weeks apart.
L:  Oh, wow.  Now --
R:  Six weeks apart since they were d- -- weaned.
L:  -- how does your -- your cat that is still alive, how is he doing?  She do- --
R:  Um, when the other cat died I took this cat and I put it up to the dead cat and I said, "Listen, this is, you know -- [MN] I'm not taking this cat away from you.  If you have any brain cells in your head, this cat is dead". [LAUGH] And it didn't seem to faze it at all.  Just -- it doesn't ... it doesn't seem to miss a beat.
L:  Hm.
R:  Very interesting.  How about -- have you -- have you lost a pet?
L:  Well, th- -- not through death but, um, I've actually, um, like, through being in different relationships and stuff, bringing other dogs into the ouse- -- uh, household and then, you know, breaking up [LAUGH] with the person, I constantly -- my dog, Dixie, she's five I actually got her when I was in college and, um, you know, I've -- she's lived with other animals before and, um, she actually likes to be alone. [LAUGH] She w- -- she's definitely a people dog.  Um, we go to the dog park and she'll run up to all the people, and she loves men.  She loves, loves, loves men.
R:  [LAUGH] Really?
L:  Yeah, it's really funny.  Um, she w- w- would -- she runs up to them but, um -- she's friendly to -- to other dogs but she prefers people, [LAUGH] people over dogs, and I'm not sure -- it's funny, you know, animals definitely have their own personality.  Would you say that about your cat?
R:  Abso- absolutely.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [several inaudible words] one of 'em's more needy, the other one was more, "Leave me alone".  And my sister has two dogs and they're both -- you know, dogs are very, very -- more intelligent I -- probably than --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- cats, I would think but, um ... the pleasure to have around -- I can't imagine, you know, not having a pet, really.
L:  So -- so is th- -- is this other cat, um -- when this other cat dies, would you get another cat?
R:  Y- -- I'm going to but, you know, also it's -- uh, pets make a mess, and --
L:  Ah, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- and they're loud, too.  I don't know about your dog barking when you -- you know, "Don't bark right now, I don't wanna --"
L:  Mm.  Right.
R:  "-- talk, I don't wanna hear no noise" and ... so I go through these things, but --
L:  We- well, I actually am very lucky 'cause my dog is very, very low maintenance.  Um, she is a great traveling companion.  I have driven across the county.  I just actually recently moved back to California from DC --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and she came on the trip with me in the car, and she's been with me several times and she's really low maintenance and I actually really like having her and she's just -- she's -- I mean, I can leave her in the house for eight hours and she's fine.  But I know a lot of people aren't that lucky.  My, um, housemate has a pit bull hound mix and she's really high [LAUGH] maintenance.  She's noisy and she's -- I think she had attention of -- attention deficit disorder [LAUGH] actually.  She needs a lot of attention, so I feel very blessed that I have a dog that is low maintenance. [LAUGH]
R:  And you both must be very close having -- traveling across country, you know, and all that.
L:  Oh, yeah, she loves me.  I mean, she can -- she's definitely feisty.  She can have that chihuahua attitude.  Um, you -- people say -- I mean, people know not to touch her sides, she doesn't like her sides to be touched, but I can pet her anywhere, touch her anywhere.  I mean, she's definitely my baby. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Would you ever get more than one dog, or a cat or ...?
L:  Oh, yeah I've had a lo- -- I actually love pugs.  I think pugs are the be- -- have you ever seen a pug?
R:  Y- yeah, I think of, like, funny looking.
L:  Yeah -- well, right.  And they snort, they go [MN] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [LAUGH] because they have bad breathing.
R:  They --
L:  Their face all are -- are smooshed in.  But I had a pug once and they are the best dogs.  And I grew up, um, with German shepherds.  I would definitely love to get a- another, uh, -nother dog, um, but I live in a house now, um, and there's my dog and then r- -- housemate has another one so probably ... won't get one yet. [LAUGH] But yeah, I -- I definitely, I love -- I love having pe- -- animals.  If I had it my way I would take every single ani- -- I could rescue every single [LAUGH] animal --
R:  Well, I -- what a great heart you have, that's --
L:  Aw.
R:  -- that tells a lot about you, just by that one statement.
L:  But, you know, I think -- 'cause they say that animals -- um, you know, they bring them into nursing homes, they have programs where th- they'll, um, you know, bring foster dogs into nursing homes and they really help the older people -- or children who are sick.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, they -- I mean, animals really help, um, because, you know, they love you unconditionally and they can tell if you're, like, upset.  Um, I don't know if, you know, your cat has good instincts [LAUGH] but, you know, if I'm upset or something my dog comes up to me and she'll lick my face and be like, "It's okay". [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Amazing.  I'm -- you know, I want to be able to have a foundation one day, uh, where I'm able to give a certain amount to -- to maybe guide dogs or something like that.  For some reason I got this affinity for guide dogs, you know, helping people that are handicapped or --
L:  Right.
R:  Y- you know, if that's ... and [SIGH] if I ever get a lotta land, I [LAUGH] want llamas, cats, dogs, pigs, goats, sheep --
L:  [LAUGH] Wow.
R:  -- I mean, th- that's just -- you kn- -- you know, but I -- I may never do it 'cause I'll come to my senses, but right now [LAUGH] I wanna be Noah, I wanna have two of everything.
L:  Well, l- -- yeah, and living in an apartment in LA I guess is [LAUGH] ...
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  ... isn't that conducive to a lot of animals.  But do you like do- -- do -- you say you like all different animals, not just cats?
R:  Absolutely.  I won't -- I won't even kill a spider or a moth.
L:  Aw.
R:  There was a moth in my car yesterday.  I was driving around and I just said, "Hello, how are you?"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "I'm sharing the world with you, I'm not gonna ..."  But I'm a big meat eater, though, man, I'll -- I can wolf down a steak, I tell you.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yes, ma'am.
L:  Ah, yeah --
R:  [LAUGH] So -- so, I'm a hypocrite.
L:  -- I'm a vegetarian. [LAUGH]
R:  You know, I ... [LAUGH] So, like I say, I'm a hypocrite; I don't know what to say. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I mean, I think d- d- different ... I don't know.  They're -- you know, fish are a little different from dogs. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right.
L:  Eating -- you know, or cows or ...
