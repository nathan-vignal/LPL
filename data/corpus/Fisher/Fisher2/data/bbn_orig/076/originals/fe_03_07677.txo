R:  Hi, I'm Rhonda.
L:  I'm Cathy.
R:  Um, the most important thing I think would be, um, I guess the morals and the values and how -- how much they, you know, are the same as yours.
L:  Um, yeah, uh, I -- I agree with that.  Um, a big thing I think is trust.  I think trust is almost everything in a relationship and if you lose that, um ...
R:  Then you have nothing.
L:  That's the way I feel.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [COUGH] And I just, um, I -- I think morals and values, yeah.  If -- if you feel the same way about things and ...
R:  Yeah, but like -- like you said, trust -- trust would be a major thing because, you know, I -- I'm from a divorce, you know, I've been divorced once.  So, trust is a major thing.
L:  Yeah, and I've been cheated on and I've --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- I've been divorced once too and, um, a lot of it was unfaithfulness --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um [LIPSMACK], you -- you just -- you're insecure about everything if you lose that -- that trust then I don't know.  I -- I just don't know how you can cheat and look someone in the -- in the eye [LAUGH] anyway.
R:  Well, yeah.
L:  But I -- that's just the most important thing to me.  So, if -- if the person I was with if they did anything to -- to, um [LIPSMACK] -- to have me lose that trust then I -- I couldn't be with them.
R:  Yes.  And, you know, morals and values kinda go along with trust because, I mean, you -- most people that have, you know, good morals and values don't cheat, you know?  You -- so you can trust them.
L:  But some people they think they have good morals and values and they justify cheating or they rationalize cheating too.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  So, they could think -- they could think well, yes, I have good morals and values, but I guess they're not the same -- I guess you'd say they're not the same.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, they're not the same as -- as the way you feel.  But, um [LIPSMACK], another thing is honesty I think.
R:  Yes.
L:  Hon- -- well, that goes along with [LAUGH] -- with trust.
R:  With trust, right.
L:  But honesty's a big thing for me because I think if you -- to me even with -- with coworkers or anyone I know once they lie it's like I never believe them again.
R:  Right.
L:  Whatever they say after that you wonder are they telling the truth.
R:  You wonder.
L:  If -- if they could lie and it's almost like some people that do lie and I have a boss that lies.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I have a ...
L:  Um, they -- they -- it's almost like they -- they don't know the truth from lies anymore.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I have a friend who's a pathological liar and it's -- it's horrible.
L:  It is.
R:  You know?  I mean, I can't ...
L:  Every time they open their mouth about anything it's, you know, is this the truth?  Are they telling the ...?
R:  I don't believe anything until I actually see it and then I have to see it more than once to go did I really see what I saw?
L:  Right.
R:  You know, it makes me start wondering about yourself, you know, when you get lied to by some- -- you know, so much by that person.
L:  Right.  Now, are you with someone now?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, me too.  I mean, we're not married and we've been together ten years.
R:  Oh, we've been married four.  We've been together five.
L:  Oh.  But, uh, you know, I -- I have all those things.  I have the trust.  I have the honesty and I just -- and I -- I had a relationship before that I didn't and it's -- it's -- it's so different.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So different.  And I loved him too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, I loved my husband but it's, you know ...?  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Yeah, that -- that makes it really rough.
L:  Hmm?
R:  I said it makes it really r- rough when you really love that person.
L:  Yeah.  But it -- it's -- that -- to me that's so important, um ...
R:  I've never done -- this is the first time I've done this.
L:  Me too.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I just, um, yeah, checked out -- checked it out yesterday.
R:  That's when it did it.  It was last night.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's, uh, different.  [LAUGH]  But, um, I thought some of the, uh, subjects were interesting --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I -- I do find the older I get the more opinionated I get.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  So, I'm -- I'm forty six.  How old are you?
R:  Thirty six.
L:  Thirty six?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Where are you from?
R:  Georgia.
L:  Georgia.  Wow!  I'm -- I'm in Massachusetts.
R:  Yeah, I've in Georgia -- I know this is off the subject -- but we've lived down here for a little over a year.  I'm originally from Illinois.
L:  Oh, 'cause I was gonna say you sound like a little -- a little bit of a southern accent.  I -- but ...
R:  Well, I lived in Southern Illinois.  So ...
L:  Is that like the south?  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] Sometimes, yes.
L:  Yeah.  I know I even kid, um, my partner.  He's from, uh, Southern Pennsylvania --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I'll -- I'll tell him well, that's kinda like the south.
R:  Right.  Right.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  This one, um -- the one I'm married to now he had never been married and -- and so he had a really big trust issue and he, you know -- a lot of things 'cause he was thirty one when we got married and, you know, he'd never been married and I had and I had kids and he didn't even know what the whole thing was about.
L:  Mhm.
R:  He learned real quick.
L:  Yeah.  But I -- and I think, um, even if you -- you were burnt once if you're with someone and the more you're with them and the more you know you can trust them, you can ease up that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- those feelings that you have and they do go away.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They do, um -- you know, a lot of my insecurities --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because I -- I know I can trust him -- have -- have gone and I'm more confident.  Uh, this is the, you know, best relationship I've ever had as far as everything goes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you know, you always have issues in relationships, but ...
R:  Well, yeah, everything -- I mean, coworkers, children, you know?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Sometimes, you know, the -- the worst thing about children is when they lie to you.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  Well, I have a, um ... How old are your kids?
R:  Twelve and ten.
L:  Twelve and ten.
R:  They're both boys.
L:  Oh, I have a, uh, twenty five year old daughter and a six year old daughter.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, you have -- you have both ends there.
L:  I have quite the -- quite the space.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, kids, yeah, and hopefully you don't -- I mean, the -- the -- if they do lie to ya, especially when they're teenagers, it's -- some of the things it's probably better off not knowing, you know?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Or they can tell ya later when you can laugh about it or ...
R:  Yeah, my twelve year old thinks he's thirty.
L:  What?  He ...
R:  My twelve year old thinks he's thirty.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  They grow up so fast.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So fast.  [LIPSMACK]  But your husband's good with the kids and ...?
R:  Mhm.  Yes, he's very good with them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, he didn't -- he didn't have any children either.  He didn't want any, you know, of his own.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  But that's important too.  I mean, you know, to -- to have someone because I had one daughter when I met my -- the -- the man I'm with now and, um, it -- to have someone they -- they had to treat, you know, my child well and --
R:  Right.  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you wouldn't put up -- I wouldn't put up with anything.
R:  It's the package deal.
L:  Yep.  Yep.  Yeah.  That -- that I looked for too.  That was very important to me having kids and I'm sure with you too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, it's a different dynamic with ya go into a relationship with kids.
R:  Yes.  'Cause see I had dated someone before that I didn't think liked children.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I kept my kids away from him and that caused a really big problem and my -- with me --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- you know, and that was like I -- I couldn't deal with it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  So ...
L:  So, you knew it wasn't worth it?
R:  Yes.  It -- it wasn't very long into it that I was like no, this isn't worth it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But then, see, it was the first relationship I'd had after my divorce.
L:  Right.  And you're lonely too --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and sometimes you -- you -- you know, you might be in the wrong one and after a while you see it.  Hopefully you'll see it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Not all women do.  But hopefully you -- you realize it's -- it's not right for you.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  I was, you know -- my mother was divorced from my father and, you know, she was always like it's a package.  [LAUGH]  You got me and my daughter, you don't get along with my daughter then you don't need me.
L:  Yep.
R:  You know?  And that's the way I live with my kids.
L:  Yeah, that's very important.
R:  You know, if I threw my kids at someone and went this is them.  This is the way they are, you can't deal with them then see ya.
L:  Yep.
R:  'Cause, you know, they're -- they're the -- they have been and probably always be, you know, the most important thing to me.  So, if the person I'm with can't deal with the kids well, you know, things like that, then I don't need that person.
L:  Right.  And you would hate for the kids to feel, you know, that you were choosing someone else --
R:  Right.
L:  -- over them.  Not that you don't deserve your life, your own life, and -- and someone for you but, you know, it's sad when people do choose --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- choose, uh, someone over their kids 'cause to me that's the most important too.
R:  Yep.
L:  But, yeah, there's nothing wrong with blended families, you know?  It -- it works.  I think it works just fine and it's very common now.  But, um, yes ...
R:  I know there's -- there's people who are, you know, still married to the first person they ever married, you know?  They're not that many people out there ...
L:  Right.  Right.  The perfect ...  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Like -- like I thought.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  When I got married I thought I would, you know, stay married forever --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and have three children and have 'em so many years apart and live happily ever after.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  It doesn't -- it doesn't work that way.
L:  No.  No.  Not always.  [LAUGH]   [LIPSMACK]  So, that's -- so you have a good relationship then?
R:  Yes, we have a very good relationship.
L:  Yeah.  No jealousy, or is there sometimes jealousy or ...?
R:  No.
L:  Jealousy's a bad thing too.
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  Yeah.  Ya gotta -- ya gotta keep that out of a relationship and it -- to me it serves no purpose because it just, you know, eats you away and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it's al- -- I felt a long time ago if --
