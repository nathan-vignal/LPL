L:  Hi.  I'm Camile.
R:  Hi.  I'm Sue and I'm in Indiana.  
L:  I'm in uh Madison, Wisconsin.
R:  Oh.  Okay.  Are you a sports lover?
L:  Um, sort of.  I don't watch it all that much on T.V. but I like football and baseball and hockey occasionally.
R:  I'm -- should be a big sports fan because of Indiana.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  But I was told the other day, if I was gonna live in Indiana, I needed to learn [inaudible] and basketball.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  'Cause they are big, big basketball thing.  They did uh -- oh, some kinda -- oh, it was a basketball movie called Hoosiers,
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that's right.
R:  And it was about a team four miles from us.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But I don't know anything about 'em.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I said that was the same year I was born, folks.
L:  [LAUGH].  So do you watch any sports on T.V.?
R:  Very seldom.  My little one likes basketball --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- on television, but we're so b- so busy, he doesn't have time to watch that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And my husband used to play football.
L:  Mhm?
R:  Just as a recreation thing, but --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- that's about it.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess -- I don't know.  I like -- I like football.  I tend to watch, like -- I like college football so I'll watch college football games.
R:  Yeah, I watch it every now and then.
L:  Every now and then.
R:  Right.  And then --
L:  [MN].
R:  -- when um I'm -- when um baseball, they have their um World Series and that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- sometimes I watch that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I was gonna say, I watched -- usually watch it when the Reds are playing, but --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- in that case, I would never watch it then.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.
R:  It -- it's just not big on the World Series there.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I -- I watch baseball sometimes.  I prefer to go to the game if it's baseball, but I'll -- I'll watch the World Series and the playoffs if teams that I like are in them.  
R:  Yeah, that's what -- that's what I usually do and I don't watch -- I don't watch a whole lot of it, but I think I watch more than sometimes I'd like to.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And as far as golf being a sport?
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I --
L:  I don't know how anyone could possibly sit and watch that on T.V.
R:  I cannot --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I cannot do that.
L:  So boring.  [LAUGH].
R:  And then when they have um I guess they were -- the studies supposedly like includes fishing as a sport.
L:  Oh.
R:  The fishing shows on T.V. to me are ridiculous.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's just like, okay, Ralph, put your bait on the hook.
L:  [LAUGH].  Yep.
R:  And it's -- I don't know, to me it's kinda like they talk to the -- talk and the audience is, like, supposed to be idiots.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  So I -- I don't do any of that either 'cause I just aggravate everybody when I watch it.
L:  Yeah.  Well, sometimes I wa- I usually watch, like, the Olympics and special events --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- on T.V.
R:  I -- I watch those. 
L:  Ice skating and I like to watch, like, snowboarding and things like.  The --
R:  I -- I find those --
L:  -- extreme sports.  [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  Aha.  I find that really interesting because I know that I'll never do 'em.
L:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  I think they always look fun, though.  There are more -- more stuff going on than some of your uh more traditional sports, I guess.  
R:  Right.  I'd -- I'd much rather watch the Olympics.  I think I watch more of that than -- than I ever do any of the other sports on television.
L:  Yeah.  Well, the Olympics just always seems so special and you have, you know -- you have to root for your home team, you know, or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you pick a team and you root, and the sports -- like, a lot of times the sports are really interesting, too, on the Olympics.  Like, uh, I like to watch like the track meets and things like that.
R:  Oh, I do too.  'Cause it's -- some of them, when they set the records and that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's just --
L:  It's very exciting.
R:  It's the look on their faces I think that makes the whole thing.
L:  Yeah.  Definitely.
R:  Knowing how hard that they've -- they've worked for all this and they said --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that they've -- they've done this for years and I don't know, I think they should give the kids a break, myself, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, sometimes it makes you just wonder if the parents are the one pushing them into the sports.
L:  Well, who knows?
R:  That's right.  
L:  But it is nice to see people that are fuelled by -- I don't know, something other than getting paid to do it, what they do.
R:  Right.  And you know, it's -- it -- they talk about the cost of all this, and it's hard to imagine what all of this costs, and to get to the places they have to get to and --
L:  I know.  Well, they usually have sponsors, don't they?
R:  Mhm.  Most of 'em do, and then there was one year, I -- don't know how old you are, but the -- the Olympics was -- there was this one guy that I think he was in skiing --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- and um he was -- he wasn't good, but yet for some reason, the people, the public, really took to this guy.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I can't think of what his name was.
L:  Mm.
R:  But after it was over, they had him on, like, Letterman and Leno and all those shows.
L:  That wasn't -- that wasn't this past year, one of those guys like Johnny Mosley or something like that?
R:  No.  This guy was -- he was re- he tried, but [MN] --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I -- it was just like everybody -- they rallied around him.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But they knew he wasn't gonna do any good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it was just -- it was kinda neat, but it was funny and I can't remember what his -- what his name was.  And this has been -- oh gee, it's been several years ago.
L:  Mm.  No, I don't remember.  Yeah.  
R:  Did you -- where did you sign up to this -- to this group through?
L:  I just got an email from a friend about it.
R:  Oh, did ya?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  I learned about it on a coupon group.
L:  Oh.  Huh.  Yeah, you know, seems like -- it's interesting.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I don't know what they're doing with the uh results of the study.
R:  Is this your -- which number are you on now?
L:  I guess this is my third call.
R:  Well, I keep missing them.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I guess --
R:  I'll be on --
L:  -- I just chose the hours that I was home 'cause I -- I don't think I've missed very many.
R:  Oh, I did.  They -- this is -- I don't know how many times they called.  I'll come in and it'll be on my answering machine about it.
L:  Huh.
R:  Or I have -- I've downloaded call wait so I wouldn't miss any calls.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it'll be on there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I -- I wondered what some of the -- uh, topics were about but I hadn't called them back.  This um my first topic was on um the war.
L:  Mhm.
R:  In Iraq, but this is -- I haven't done any on sports yet and I thought, oh of all of them, all the ones that they could ask me about --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- would be sports.
L:  I know.  I don't know that much about sports.
R:  And I thought if they have to get real technical, I could tell them what a football and a basketball look like.
L:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Sports, I guess that's more of a guy thing.  [LAUGH].
R:  I think so, too.  But there's -- there's a couple women I know that, when football comes on, that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they're right there, but the only reason I like to watch football is the way they've got 'em padded, you know?  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.  Actually though, the person I know that I think watches the most televised sports is my grandmother.  She watches sports probably every day.  She watches something.  She loves baseball and basketball.  I think she watches football sometimes.  Mostly baseball and basketball and it's just [LAUGH] it's just very funny.
R:  Well, my -- my parents never watched sports or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- did anything about 'em or anything uh with 'em, watched 'em, and they -- they moved down to Florida and mom will call and she'll say, "Did you see this basketball game?" 
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I'm, "No, I -- I still have a life, mom".  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess if you don't have much else to do.
R:  No, and I just -- I don't -- even they -- they root for Kentucky.
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  So whenever they're playing, I always know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because of them.  But there's -- there's some basketball that I don't intentionally turn it on --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it just kinda happens.
L:  Mhm.
R:  When you're flipping through channels.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But we -- we don't get cable where we are, so we have satellite.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And the sports on there, they -- they tell you, "Well, you're gonna get all these channels" and there's sports mainly.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I can't see paying all of that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- extra, which --
L:  You --
R:  -- I do.
L:  Yeah, you really have to be a crazy sports fan to uh -- to want to get all that.
R:  I know, and I think if they -- they're gonna give you a choice of things to pay for, they oughta let you decide whether you want the sports on it or not.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Definitely.  Yeah, I just have regular cable so it's just sort of whatever's on.  
R:  Mm.
L:  I really don't usually -- it's very rare that I'll be surfing the channels and stop on a game, though.  Usually it'll be a -- I'll stop on, like, extreme sporting events and I'll stop on -- I'll stop on hockey sometimes for like ten or fifteen minutes.
R:  Now, I've gotten um tickets to ball games and I've won 'em, won --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- tickets, like to boxing and all of that.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh [LAUGH].  Uh-huh.
R:  And people say, "Well, they're paying big money for that".  I say, well, I'll sell them to 'em.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  But I just -- and then we had some Reds tickets a few weeks ago --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and my youngest is not really into sports all of that much --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so he said that he would just rather go another time or whatever and I said, well, that makes me happy.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Not have to go over and -- but I don't know, they've got their new stadium over there now and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- everybody's paying taxes on 'em, to watch 'em.
L:  Of course, yeah.  
R:  Corked bats and whatever else it is. 
L:  [LAUGH] --
