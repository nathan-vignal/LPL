R:  Hello?
L:  Yes, hello, this is George.
R:  Hi, this is Kelly.
L:  Hi, Kelly.  Do you have a pet?
R:  I do, I have a -- one dog.  How about yourse- --
L:  I do too.
R:  You do?  What kind of dog do you have?
L:  I have a pug, a Chinese pug.
R:  Oh, wow.  So, how much time do you spend with him?
L:  [LAUGH] My whole life.
R:  [LAUGH] Your whole life?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  He's like a child?
L:  My -- [LAUGH] he's, like, worse than a child. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Really? [LAUGH] Is -- [LAUGH] is a high maintenance dog?
L:  It is nonstop, you know, the pug -- the pug, ah, the pug, um -- this association has a newsletter and the letterhead of the newsletter says, "You haven't lived until you've been owned by a pug".
R:  [LAUGH] Really?
L:  And when I got this pug six years ago I had no idea what that meant. [LAUGH] I can tell you, it means every letter of the word.
R:  Really?  Well, do you have children?
L:  Uh, two, yeah.
R:  Oh, you do.  Are they grown?
L:  But the pug is jealous. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really, the pug?  'Cause I -- you know, my dog was so important -- he is still important but I have a two year old little girl and I never realized he would take such a back seat to her.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it's so sad because he was such my little baby.
L:  Right.
R:  And, um, and then I had her and sh- -- I just -- you know, I'm with her so much [LAUGH] that my poor --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- dog, [LAUGH] he's like just a back seat major.
L:  That -- so what kind of a dog again is it?
R:  He is, em, like, a -- a chihuahua terrier mix.  We just got him at a little no kill shelter.
L:  And how old?
R:  Um, four.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So ... he -- he's a very, very low maintenance dog.  Um, you know, he's not a big barker, em ... he --
L:  Oh, that's wild.
R:  He doesn't have to go to the vet a lot or anything [LAUGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so I -- I think I'm the opposite in the spectrum --
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  -- of you.
L:  Easy maintenance.  This one is constant m- -- high maintenance.  High, high maintenance.
R:  Really?  Wh-, uh, what do you mean, as far as vet -- like, m- medicine and stuff?
L:  Oh, no, no, n- nothing to do with that.  Just, [LAUGH] "I wanna do what I wanna do now and I [LAUGH] want you to do it with me" and, "Why can't I cuddle now and why can't we ha- -- eat now" and demands to go out every twenty minutes and --
R:  Uh.
L:  -- you know, high maintenance.
R:  Oh, really demands to --
L:  A little prince.
R:  Really demands to go out every twenty minutes?
L:  Well, I mean, just, you know.  Y- you ca- -- there's no such thing any more as sitting down and reading the paper and reading a book and just kind of being quiet for an hour.  The dog just wants to [LAUGH] constantly do something. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, really?  That is so --
L:  And if he doesn't -- if he doesn't get responses, he'll get up on the sofa or the bed and he'll nudge his face in the back of the paper.  He'll nudge -- he'll nudge you until you [LAUGH] interact with him.
R:  Yeah, and that's just -- that's characteristic of those dogs?
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're just very, like ... they just --
L:  Yeah, it has to be inbred because, uh, we have a friend who has a ... a pug who's, uh, twelve years old.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And really the only reason we wanted a pug is because we had been with this pug on several occasions and he was like a lapdog.  We thought, living in New York, wouldn't it be nice just to have a little lapdog. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Oh, you're in New York?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, wow, we're in Texas.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  So we're far from you.
L:  That's -- wow.
R:  Um, so anyway, so you didn't know the, um ... how much time it was going to require.
L:  No.  But, you know, it's worth -- it's -- it's worth it.  Sometimes you get very frustrated by it but just -- it's so sweet and so adorable and ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  ... demanding and all that but just, you know, really adds such a quality --
R:  Well, the --
L:  -- to life.
R:  And those dogs don't shed.
L:  They do too.
R:  Oh, they shed?
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  Oh, they do?
L:  But it's the tiny little hairs, you know, it's not like long collie hair or long hair from a golden retriever or something.
R:  Yeah, so you don't -- it's like you just have hair everywhere?
L:  [LAUGH] No.
R:  No.
L:  But my sister has to, you know, brush off her and tape off her sometimes.
R:  Right.  Right.  Oh, that's interesting.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, your kids love the dog?
L:  Uh, yeah.  Very much.  Great with kids.
R:  Yeah, great with kids.
L:  Great, great, great with kids.
R:  Really?  No -- no nipping or anything?
L:  Uh, no, never ever.  Not once.
R:  Yeah, well, we --
L:  Never been confrontational once in [inaudible] in --
R:  Yeah, that's good.  My friend has a, um [SIGH] a l- labrador --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, retriever, and it bit her little boy last week --
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  -- in his face, spent four days in hospital.  And it's a sweet dog --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- but I just, um, think that her little boy pushed him ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  ... too far so ...
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  So, that's good [several inaudible words] worry --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- 'cause dogs can, um, you know, get upset and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um --
L:  But he's great, you know, we travel with him.  We were in Paris in March and he came to Paris with us.
R:  Oh, wow, w- --
L:  We go to California.  He's just in his little --
R:  Like, what do you -- how do you travel with him?  You put him in a crate?  In a --
L:  No, he ha- -- no, I would never travel with an animal in a -- in a crate down in that cargo area.  Um, no, he goes in a sherpa bag.  And the sherpa bag you put underneath the seat in the plane [LIPSMACK] and then you, uh, you know, he just sleeps.  You bring a little bit of water and food along but most- mostly he just sleeps.
R:  Right, 'cause, oh, he's a -- a -- he's small enough that he can do that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, 'cause I -- I -- I have never traveled with a dog, but I know that -- that I'd be scared to put a crate underneath the plane.
L:  I know.  He's great, he's been in -- to the Caribbean twice in the last year.
R:  Wow, he just lays there and ...?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, that's very interesting, 'cause --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you would never want to crate him, put him underneath.
L:  Never.  I would never -- I think it would traumatize the dog.
R:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  I know.  I -- I think that is kind of cruel ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  ... too.  I have never, um, done that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We've never traveled -- just car traveled with the dog.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, and just putting -- if we ever have to board him, like, if we're -- we went out of town a few weeks ago and we had to board him.  Oh, so traumatic for the -- for the poor dog.
L:  Right.
R:  He was pretty sick when he got back --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- from not eating and stuff, so ... I'm -- try not to do that very often. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That was not very fun. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  So, good, well, um --
L:  That's very funny.  So, uh, do you have any other trouble with your dog or is ...?
R:  Um, no, he's -- sheds a little bit so I definitely have -- and he is a blond dog so --
L:  Uh -- oh, I see.
R:  -- it definitely shows up some.  So I have to, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, vacuum the furniture a lot but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- um, no, you know, I really, when we found him at the no kill shelter, we -- he's just little, ten pounds, so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- he has been such a sweet little dog and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, yeah, my littl- -- and I have a little girl, so she doesn't, em, terrorize him as much as I think maybe some -- I have friends that have boys.
L:  Right.
R:  They seem to terrorize their dogs more --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but she's pretty good with him, so ...
L:  Huh.
R:  So, anyway.  So, yeah, we -- we've really enjoyed him, um --
L:  Great.
R:  I just hope that he doesn't get too lonely, 'cause we're kind of out and about and running around, so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- he just sleeps and ... I guess -- is that what your dog does when you're gone, just sleeps, has a little bed and ...?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just sleeps -- does it sleep in your bed or does it have its own bed?
L:  What's that?
R:  Does your -- does the dog sleep in your bed, or d- --
L:  Ah, he sleeps in, um, uh ... the bed sometimes, but I've been putting him in the living room a lot, um, just 'cause he's very restless.
R:  Oh, he moves around?
L:  Uh, so there's still a little, uh -- a little, uh, doggie gate across the living room entrance and he sleeps in there, and then he cries around six or six thirty in the morning and wants to come in.
R:  Oh.  Oh, so it's like having a baby. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, it's like having a baby.  And then, you know, [SIGH] in New York there's no backyard to go out in so there is the walk at seven AM, there's the walk at four thirty, five o'clock in the afternoon, there's the walk at nine, ten, eleven o'clock at night, [LAUGH] there's the [LAUGH] ...
R:  Oh, really? [inaudible] --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  You mean, like -- 'cause, what, do you live in a highrise apartment or something?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, so then you have to go o- -- at six -- at seven o'clock in the morning, then you have to go down -- outside?
L:  Every single day.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No, it isn't like you just open the back door. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] I do- -- [LAUGH] I can't even fathom that, you know, just --
L:  Right.
R:  -- open the backdoor and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, ah, that's how we are, so --
L:  Right.
R:  Really, so, like, even -- like, right now, isn't it, like, pouring down rain there?
L:  It was, but it seems to be, uh ... it seems to have stopped now.
R:  Oh, okay.  So you -- but even in the rain, and there you'll be outside at seven AM?
L:  Rain, snow, everything.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, are you a morning person?
L:  I've -- didn't used to be. [LAUGH]
R:  You didn't used to be, but yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But you -- you are now. [LAUGH]
L:  That's very funny.  You get -- this is very interesting to have this subject to talk about because yesterday [LAUGH] was about bioterrorism and I -- and, you know, you have to really work at that.  But this, I could talk for two hours and ten minutes [LAUGH] about it [inaudible] --
R:  About your -- really?  Really -- what -- when people are talking about their kids, do you talk to them about your dog, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- "Oh, my dog". [LAUGH]
L:  That's right, that's right.
R:  [LAUGH] That is -- I know, it was funny when it said, "Pets".  I'm like, "Oh, that's an easy topic".
L:  Yeah, it's very funny.
R:  I had never -- I didn't know what the topic was going to be so that was interesting --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- um, that they said pets.  But dogs -- the thing about dogs is that they love you, no matter what.
L:  Oh, the loyalty is phenomenal.
R:  Yeah.  It's so fun so see just, um -- you know, even to my daughter, I -- I mean, the love that he has for her and she has for him, it's so interesting.
L:  Right.
R:  And that he's always happy and, um --
L:  Oh, that's great.
R:  It is, it's such a nice ... you know, it's nice to have that ...
L:  Oh, definitely.
R:  ... have that in a dog, so -- so, how long do those dogs live?
L:  They, ah, they live till, um ... [LIPSMACK] anywheres between fourteen and fifteen years.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Thirteen.  But we just -- have a friend who is a -- ha- has a veterinarian who has three of these pugs, and he has a black pug that is either nineteen or twenty years old.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Which in dog years is like --
L:  Which is both the good news and the bad news. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's, like, a hundred and forty or something in the dogs years.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, my goodness.  Well, you think you'll just have one or are you planning to get another one?
L:  Uh, I think ... uh, I was thinking of that and then I think that he would be, um, jealous.
R:  Yeah.  You think he's just been a --
L:  He doesn't like it when other people or other dogs get too much attention when he's around. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  Very sweet.  I mean, he's a lover but he just wants to be the one. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, he- -- yeah, he's very touchy all and stuff so he wa- -- really wants your attention.
L:  Right.
R:  Oh, so you think -- [MN] like, you thinking about getting a companion, he would not be happy with that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- with the companion.  Oh, [LAUGH] that's so interest- --
