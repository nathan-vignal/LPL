R:  Hi, my name is Pat.
L:  Oh, hello, I'm Eric.
R:  Hi Eric.  Today's topic she said was, do you have a pet?
L:  Yeah, do you have a -- a pet?  And, um, and how much time do you spend with it?
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH] Do you have a pet?
L:  Yeah, I have one.  I have a -- a cat actually.  So, and, um, actually I work a lot so it's my day off.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, I --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- I don't spend a lot of time with it but, you know, I -- I love my cat so ...
R:  [inaudible] didn't care.
L:  What about you.  Do you have one?
R:  Well, that's kinda strange.  I -- yes and no.  Ah, I moved back into help my mother 
L:  Right.
R:  -- and we share a pet -- a pet, um, a dog who has a mind of her own.  Her name is Lady --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and we've had a problem with her making humongous holes in the yard.
L:  Humongous holes.  What does she do, dig?
R:  Dig!  I mean, just straight down.  Not -- you know, most dogs they dig a little and they go someplace else.  Not her.  She digs until it's a hole that you could hurt yourself in.
L:  Right.
R:  And we've been filling in holes, and filling in holes, and right now she's on punishment.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, see my cat -- what happens with, like, with my cat is that it will always go on top of my car, all the time.
R:  [MN] 
L:  [several inaudible words] and actually, today actually, I backed out --
R:  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  -- just to see, like, how long she would --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- stay up there.  And she actually stayed on my car -- 
R:  Uh-oh.
L:  -- my cat s- --as I rode out of the driveway so ...
R:  [LAUGH] That would make a neat trick for a parade.  Let her ride on top of the car.
L:  I thought about maybe videotaping it or something and sending it to one of those real TV shows or something --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- you know.
R:  Oh, that would be neat.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  That would be neat. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, uh, now in my neighborhood, uh, there used to be, uh, several cats that had a habit of getting under my car.
L:  Right.
R:  So, before I could pull out, I had to look to make sure nobody's cat was under my car.
L:  Right.
R:  So, watch for that, if yours hasn't done that.  Um, they tell me they do that for when it's, um, when it's cold to try to keep warm.
L:  Right.  Now how -- how old's your dog?
R:  My dog?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is about, uh, hi- -- eight -- eight in -- in -- in human years.  [LAUGH] No.  She's a year and a half.
L:  Right.
R:  And she's, uh, she's huge.  She comes --
L:  What type of dog is it?
R:  She's a lab and German Shepherd.
L:  Lab, wow!
R:  And she's really big.
L:  Wow!
R:  um --
L:  See, when I was a kid I had a lab.  I had a little black lab.  But it was like --
R:  Oh.  [LIPSMACK] [NOISE]
L:  -- a runt of the bunch, it never grew.
R:  [LAUGH] You get the run.  Oh, no.
L:  Yeah.  We picked the runt. 
R:  [MN] 
L: Yeah, I mean, like, we went -- we went to pick the dog and it -- it actually jumped over the -- over the fence and went running.
R:  Oh.
L:  We were, like, yeah, we want that one.
R:  That's it [LAUGH] 
L:  We want -- we want the crazy one.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, that's so cute.  No, this one for some reason was always really a big dog.
L:  Right. 
R:  She's always -- even when she was a -- a pup, she wasn't one of those little cuddly pups.  Mm mm.  She was a big puppy.  Nobody would believe that she was six months, when she was six months.  I don't know why she's so big.  She's trim but she's -- she's, um, when she stands, she's at my shoulders.
L:  Right.
R:  And she stays in the garage most of the time.  She has a little bedding and all that.  Um, I opened the door -- [LAUGH] we almost had an accident last week -- see she's really -- I think we're getting on her nerves.  She thinks she's a person.  I opened my garage door without looking first and she fell on me and just scratched all the way down my shoulders.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, when -- when she came down my shoulders --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I thought, oh no I'm hurting -- I'm hurting, I'm going to have to go to the hospital.  [LAUGH] We had this, um, groomer to cut her nails, but she didn't do a very good job.
L:  Imagine it going to the hospital try to explain that, "Oh, and what happened?"  "Oh, my dog fell on me".  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] The weirdest things was I almost had to go.  I just -- I hurt so badly in some wrong places.  Those nails just cut what they could going down --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- and I thought, "Oh, God, no, this is it.  This is it".  So, I've called the lady again and said, "We want a referral to someone who can help us get her nails gro-", I mean, they're really, really sharp and they curve.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, i- -- I mean, they're in such good shape because she's always, like, she's always manicuring them on the dirt.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Is she digging all the time?
R:  All the time.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know, I keep telling mom, she must be missing some kind of a nutrient to dig that much.  I mean, dogs --
L:  Well, see  --
R:  -- just don't dig that much.
L:  Oh, no.  Uh, I think my cat's pregnant though.
R:  [MN]
L:  'Cause I do.  I think it's [several inaudible words] it's -- it's her gut is getting huge.  I know it's pregnant.
R:  Oh, no.  Do you want extra -- extras around?  Or are you going to do --
L:  Ah --
R:  -- something with them?
L:  -- n- now I'm thinking well, you know what, I should have had her spayed.  I mean, 'cause I --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [several inaudible words] all these kittens, you know what I mean so, I'll try to be hocking kittens on everybody.  I'll be, like, you want a free one, you want a free one, you know.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, man, that's after the fact.  Now what kind is she?
L:  She -- it's a calico cat.
R:  Oh, man, they're so beautiful.  I -- I don't know, I -- I -- I've got friends that all the time, I mean, especially in spring time, hey, I've got five of these, I've got th- -- no, go.  Go, go.  I can't have a cat because I've got a dog that thinks she owns the place.  [LAUGH] Wow.  Now as a child I had a dog, um, that was as big as this one but, uh, she was a collie --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and the m- most --
L:  Oh, those are awesome.  Those are beautiful dogs.
R:  -- gentle thing.  I mean, we kids could go anywhere; she'd be with us.  As a matter of fact though, she would -- and this was in the day when we could walk to school, okay.
L:  Right.
R:  We'd walk to school and she'd walk to school.  And then she'd come home.  But occasionally she would not go home.  So, somebody would have to get permission to go all the way home and get our mom to put her on a chain till we got back to school.
L:  Right.  Wow!
R:  But -- and when we got out in the evening, she'd be back at the school.
L:  See, we used to have -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- also we -- see we got the lab, but before that we had a little West Highland white terrier dog.
R:  Wow!
L:  And -- and it was the -- and we -- I remember we -- the poor dog, we always used to take it and we used to get it shaved.  We used to [LAUGH] shave off its hair --
R:  Oh, man.
L:  -- and everything and I -- I -- ask my mom, I'm like, "Why did you shave the dog?"  I was asking her and she'd say, like, "I don't know, 'cause it was hot out" you know.
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I mean, so there'd be this little shaved dog running around.  You know what I mean?  It was just strange.
R:  [LAUGH] How cute.  Oh, man.  Well, I don't know, our -- our -- our dog was perfect, believe it or not, and, uh, we had her for lots of years.  And that's why our mother didn't want another puppy around at all to fall in love with.  She said that's it, mom.  They're pets, now you can do a lot more for them.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Than -- than you could when we were kids.  I mean, when we were kids, dogs went to the vet only for shots.
L:  Right.
R:  But no such thing, my -- my dog's been to the hospital for surgery and, you know, please.
L:  Like a human being, you know what I mean?
R:  Like a human being.  Ooh.
L:  Is that -- now do -- do you, like, dress your dog up and all that stuff?  And [inaudible]. 
R:  Oh, no.  No, no.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I wouldn't even think she would stand it.  Now, um, when she was really small, we had a sweater to put on her.  And we tried putting that sweater on and she kept biting it.  We learned then that this one doesn't like clothes.  Just not --
L:  Well, I got, like, a -- I got, like, a pair of socks for my cat.  I don't even know why.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But, I thought -- I thought, you know, I've been thinking okay, I'm going to give this a try and try to put the socks on, you know what I mean?  Cats scratching me like crazy --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- yelling, yeh-ow, you know.  And I'm sitting there and all my neighbors are looking at me, you know what I mean?  Like -- like I'm torturing the cat or something.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm, like, "No, I'm just putting socks on the cat, it's okay".
R:  Okay, now that's the one you need to videotape.  [LAUGH] 
L:   You know what I mean?
R:  [LAUGH] Trying to dress the cat and she does not want those clothes on.  Now the only thing my dog really likes besides, you know, rubbing and people standing up -- she likes to stand up on you how, you know, with her hands on your shoulders.  And you pat her and rub her and all that.  She likes that.
L:  Right.
R:  But the thing she likes the most is being wet.  So, you can bathe her and she won't even move.  This is the first dog I've ever had.  You can bathe her and she just stands there.  
L:  And so, does she ever -- y- you want to do something really interesting; have you ever tried to like flea bath a cat?
R:  No.
L:  Oh -- oh, this is an experience I'm telling you.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It is.  I -- I mean, you talk about -- you know what I mean?  Like, I got some angry people but man, like --like, when I tried to flea bath my cat, I'm like, anger beyond.  You know what I mean?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  The cat, you know what I mean?  Like the cats -- I'm -- I'm s- so one of these times the cat's, like, head's going to turn round, like, in the movie of the exorcist, you know what I mean?
R:  Ooh.
L:  I mean, he gets angry.
R:  You've got to get that videotape out.  Bring your camera out and just -- just leave it on.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I -- you know what I mean?
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, Gosh.
L:  'Cause I've seen -- I've seen this cat, you know what I mean?  It isn't -- and, like, sometimes, like, I'll come home and stuff like that, and the cat will -- it will look -- like, run and, like, jump on my leg and stuff and it has claws and it'll be hanging thee so I --
R:  Ooh, shh.
L:  -- like, walk in, the cat will be, like, hanging on my leg.
R:  I went to see a friend of mine who was very ill.  Her cat -- now she thinks she's -- the cat considers itself playing.  She was playing around my leg et cetera, and then she got stuck in my panty hose, and those nails just went through my leg.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, man, they're -- I'm going, "Ooh, your cat drew blood, get your cat off" [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] a cat, because she says, [LIPSMACK] "Uh-hum, it will have to be inside at all times" and there were times when it just has to go out.
L:  Right.
R:  I'm going well, hm, okay.  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, we got the dog and the dog got too big really soon and she has to go out.  [LAUGH] Ooh, she's a neat little thing.
L:  See I thought about getting a dog but I thought, no.  You know, 'cause --
R:  What do you stay in?  A house?
L:  Yeah.  I have my own home.
R:  Okay.  Now see we're in a house.  Y- -- it's a big house and so I really thought we'd have one of the extra bathrooms, you know, just fixed up for the little puppy while we [inaudible].  No, she grew too fast.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LIPSMACK] --
