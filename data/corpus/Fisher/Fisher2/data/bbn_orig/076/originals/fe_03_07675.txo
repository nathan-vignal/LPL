L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Celia.
R:  Hi, Celia.  My name is Laurie.
L:  Hey, Laurie.  Um, I'm in the Tampa Bay area.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And I'm in Los Angeles.
L:  Oh, okay.  You know, I've talked to mostly people out there.  [LAUGH]
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, there was ...
R:  Have you been doing this for a while?
L:  No. Well, I mean, this is just my third call.  So ...
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Um, but, yeah, I --
R:  This is my first time.  Yeah.
L:  -- I keep talking to people in L.A.  Yeah.  There was a guy yesterday from Hollywood.  So ...
R:  Really?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That's real close to actually, uh, where I'm at right now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I w- -- I work ...
L:  Have you been out there long?
R:  Yeah.  I actually, uh, was born and raised in San Fernando Valley.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, and when, uh, I decided to buy a house I traveled, uh, from the Valley to -- it's only about twenty five miles to Beverley Hills.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But it used to take me an hour and a half to get work.  So, when I buy a house I --
L:  Oh, gosh!
R:  -- I bought one that's eight miles from work.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I would only have to travel -- it still takes eight -- it still takes about forty minutes in the morning to go eight miles.
L:  Yeah.  Well --
R:  How 'bout you?
L:  -- Tampa Bay is bad too especially in the winter, uh, from about oh, Thanksgiving to Easter.
R:  You have a winter there?  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, yeah, month wise anyway.
R:  Right. 
L:  But, um, yeah, so all the northers come down and -- and, uh, our traffic doubles during that time and -- and --
R:  Definitely.
L:  -- there's just no place else to put roads.  So ...  [LAUGH]
R:  So, what kinda work do you do?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Uh, right now I'm a stay at home Mom.
R:  Cool.  Very cool.
L:  So, that's why I'm doing this.  Yeah.  Um, you know, so I'm just kinda scrabbling to do anything I can [LAUGH] 'cause my husband is traveling right now a lot and, um, so I couldn't ...
R:  Does that take a toll on your relationship at all or is it ...?
L:  What's that?
R:  Does it take a toll on your relationship the traveling or just -- actually does it give you guys space and ...?
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's not bad.  It's, um -- you know, I mean, it took some getting used to of course.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, but -- but it's had some really positive, uh, effects.  He's -- you know, 'cause he appreciates being home when he's come.
R:  I can imagine.
L:  Yeah, and he -- you know, he used to get home from work and be kinda tried and crabby and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, uh, now he gets home he's just so excited to be here.
R:  There's no place like home.  You can go, you know, to Hawaii or the -- you know, just somewhere that's just totally paradise --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but there's just nothing like coming home.
L:  That's true.
R:  There's just really nothing like seeing your animals and ...
L:  Yeah.  Well, we have a two year old.  So, um ...
R:  Oh, that keeps you busy.
L:  Yeah, and -- and when he was working, uh, fulltime I worked weekends.  So, he spent a lotta time with her on the weekends and, um, you know, which a lotta Dads don't get to do --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] and, uh, so he really misses her when he goes.
R:  Oh.
L:  But we've been married, uh, eight years.  So ...
R:  Eight years?
L:  Yeah.  So, we're not -- you know, we're not in the real upheaval, you know, kind of ...
R:  Eight years is a long time.  If you get -- marriage wise if you get through the first, what, year or two then you're --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, that's I guess the hardest.  Was that the hardest for you adjusting to being married and ...?  I don't know if you lived together prior to your marriage or anything like that.
L:  We did.  We lived together for about a year before we were married, um ...
R:  But what -- once you got married did it seem different?
L:  It -- it didn't and then -- and then it does.  I mean, you -- you start -- you start realizing it -- it is different, um, and I -- I would have to say though -- 'cause we were married, well, six years before we had the baby and, um, that's when you really feel married, you know?  Once -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- once the kid comes along it's like wow!  You know?  [LAUGH]
R:  Definitely.
L:  But, um -- but it's a good thing.  I mean, I -- it's -- it's been -- it's -- it -- it gets better.  It really does.
R:  So, being married eight years and having a two year old did you plan the time that you wanted a child?
L:  Well, we had been trying --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and, um -- and we had a hard time, uh, conceiving.  So, um ...
R:  Congratulations then.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well, thank you and -- and we're trying again here, um -- you know, in a month or so.  So -- but, um, yeah, so I mean we were tickled to death and, um [LIPSMACK], um -- yeah, so we definitely planned it and -- and really had to work at it and -- and, uh, that made it even sweeter.  So ...
R:  What's your son's name?
L:  Uh, it's a little girl, Gracie.
R:  Oh, a little girl?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Gracie.
L:  Right.  And now are you married?
R:  No, I'm not married.  Um, I've been with the same person since ninety one.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um ...
L:  So, that's a life partner I would say.
R:  Y- you know, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's -- it's just that, uh, I get -- you know, and he's got two kids and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, they're now sixteen and eighteen.  I guess they're ...
L:  [LAUGH] Sweet.  So, you've known them since they were little, tiny then?
R:  Yeah.  In July, uh, Steven will be nineteen and in September Billy will be seventeen and so ...
L:  Right, and so -- and that all goes real smoothly?
R:  You know, it does, you know, there was those, uh, few years at first when, you know, you're just really not used to -- actually it was -- it didn't take me long to really jump in and -- because they'd come over, you know, every other weekend and it would be "Don't.  Stop".
L:  Right.
R:  Two boys so close in age, you know, and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, you know, at first it was kinda like, you know, they're not my kids and -- but it really didn't take long to jump in and say, "Hey".  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  And, you know, I -- I would see them, they'd play basketball on the front yard and -- and they would ac- -- you know, actually try to hurt each other.
L:  Does their Dad ...?
R:  You know, take the basketball and throw it as hard as they can at each other --
L:  Well, that's boys I think.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and I'm thinking I never wanted to hurt my brother growing up.  It was just ...
L:  Ah.  Well, did he feel the same way?
R:  N- -- actually he didn't really -- he liked -- he liked to torment me with --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with bugs.
L:  Yeah.
R:  He'd pretend to even have a bug and he didn't have one --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but he played around like he had one and just, yeah, he liked to torment me.
L:  [LAUGH] Right.  What ...?
R:  So, that was just argh.
L:  Does their Dad back you up really good then?
R:  Yeah.  I remember, um -- you know, it's different -- parenting is so different because, you know?  I remember they came over and, uh, this was about a year into the relationship and -- with the kids --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and -- 'cause it took a while before he introduced me to the kids --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, 'cause maybe it was like a shock on them because he'd --
L:  Sure.  Oh, certainly.  Yeah.
R:  -- just gotten a divorce and they moved, uh ...
L:  And you.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  And they moved to Palm Desert and I just remember them coming over and they were watching this -- every other word was a four letter word --
L:  Oh oh.
R:  -- in the movie that they were renting, you know, and their Dad didn't -- didn't care.  Their mother didn't care.  I mean, this is what they -- they didn't mind at all and I was just -- I was kinda shocked.
L:  Right.
R:  We weren't allowed to watch things like that at my age --
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  -- and if we did things that kids do these days we'd be slapped from here to the next, uh, town.
L:  [MN] Some of 'em weren't even available.
R:  And they'd stay up 'til two in the morning and they'd get up about noon or so and it was about one o'clock and they'd been up maybe an hour --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they said, "Laurie, can we have the -- the piece of leftover pizza that's in the ...?  And I said, "Yeah, go ahead" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and then I got chastised for giving 'em pizza for breakfast --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and I'm thinking number one it's one o'clock in the afternoon --
L:  That's -- yeah, that's -- that's ...
R:  -- and look what you just let them watch last night.
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.  It's funny, isn't it?  Um ...
R:  It's just amazing how people will be so different.  I said, "Now, I would be saying well, pizza's fine but, you know, what they watched last night was not".
L:  Right.  Right.  Well, I -- I would say you're, uh -- that you've really hit it as far as, um -- probably that's the most important thing.  I mean, you -- and you don't realize that 'til you have kids that it's your ability to compromise and -- and, um, deal with different values and the things that you think are important they think are trivial or vice versa and ...
R:  And, you know, I don't know if it's a girl thing or a -- a guy thing as far as, uh, in a -- in a relationship, but it's -- it's -- Billy -- we were watching something and he said, "Laurie, you know that scene just now where those -- the two couples were just F.'ing ...?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And he was like nine --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and I'm just going "No, Billy --"
L:  Oh, dear!
R:  "-- the proper way to ask that question is ..."
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I'm thinking if he'd asked his Dad that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- would it have been the same?  I mean, I -- I don't know if it's just 'cause it's a guy thing or if his Dad would've just answered the question, yeah -- yeah, that scene --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I'm just thinking oh, this is just so different, you know, and of course I'm sure they act different around their father than they would a female.  They -- they'll always respect me though.  They -- you know, it's -- we just got together for Father's Day, they came out and they d- -- they -- of course they're driving now so they drive.  They live in Palm Desert, which is near Palm Springs, which is a couple of hours drive.
L:  Mhm.
R:  About two and a half, three hour drive depending on the traffic --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and now they're able to drive out to see us, which is nice.
L:  Right.
R:  You don't have to go meet halfway and --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- all that kinda stuff and --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- it's nice to see that now that they're driving that they still want to come out.
L:  Yeah.  I bet.
R:  You know, it's not -- wasn't just the okay, we have to come out kinda thing and all right, Mom, whatever you say.  Okay, Dad, whatever you say.  It was more -- now, you know, they'll call and say, "Hey, can we come out" and it's -- it's ...
L:  Right.  Well, you must have done something right then.
R:  Yeah, it's a good -- yeah, it's -- it's ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're -- they're so tall.  There's one six -- six three and the other's about six two.
L:  Oh, my gosh!
R:  Yeah, at sixteen and ...
L:  I can't even imagine.
R:  Just, yeah, tall and all boy.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're just ... yeah.
L:  Well ...
R:  So, what's your husband's name?
L:  Eric.
R:  Eric?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And what does Eric do in the traveling ...?
L:  Um, he, uh -- he goes and looks at buildings that, um -- when -- when companies wanna set their buildings for wireless communication --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, all that wire- [LAUGH] -- all that wireless stuff is actually full wires, it's in the building itself, so that your cell phone works for example.
R:  Right.  Right.  Right.
L:  So, like they did the Superdome in New Orleans and ...
R:  Interesting.
L:  Yeah, because there's -- there's all these tunnels and things that run under it, um ...
R:  To make sure there's not a lotta interference?
L:  Right.  Well, to make sure they can even get, uh, access, you know, 'cause, um, walkie talkies, cell phones, all that stuff doesn't -- doesn't work down there.
R:  Did you two meet during, uh -- working or did you meet, uh ...?
L:  Yeah, we did.  We worked together is how we met.
R:  So, you had an office romance that blossomed into ...?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Actually we did.
R:  That's cool.  I met on the golf course.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It was kind of, uh -- I remember, um, he winked at me at the end and I w- ran over to his car and said, "Hey, did you like the golf?" and said, "Man, that was the best wink I ever had" and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I was golfing with a friend and he thought it was my boyfriend and it was just a friend of mine --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and he was drinking a beer.  I said, "Jay, you gotta put your beer down.  We're going".  So, I -- he always had to joke me that I owe that man a beer.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  And it was the best wink that I ever [LAUGH] --
