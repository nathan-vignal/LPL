R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.  I'm Liz.
L:  Hi, I'm Karen.  
R:  Uh, okay.  I'm from central Illinois. 
L:  Oh, I'm from central Wisconsin.
R:  Well, there, very good.
L:  [LAUGH].  
R:  Okay.  Well, the topic is pets.  Have you done this before?
L:  No, this is the first time.
R:  Okay.  This is my second time.
L:  Okay. 
R:  Um, so anyway, basically we just talk about it for ten minutes, till the buzzer beeps.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, do you have a pet?
L:  Yes, I do.  Actually, I have two.
R:  Well good, 'cause you'll be doing most of the talking 'cause I don't have a pet and I'm not a pet person.   [LAUGH].
L:  Oh [LAUGH].  Lucky you --
R:  But I can talk on it a little bit.
L:  Okay.  Good.
R:  I can -- I can expand on why I don't have a pet, but tell me what you have?
L:  Okay.  I have a dog.
R:  Mhm.
L:  My main one is a dog.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, she's ten years old.
R:  Mhm.
L:  She's a yellow Lab and her name is Sadie.
R:  Sadie?
L:  Sadie, right.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And um she actually was a birthday present from my husband to be, ten years ago.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, it was an easy --
R:  Now, is that old for a Lab?
L:  Um, yes.  From --
R:  So she's --
L:  -- what I've been told, it is.  They --
R:  She's getting older, then?
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  Mm.  Okay.
L:  Bigger -- bigger dogs get older quicker than littler dogs.
R:  Okay.  Okay.
L:  And she's about eighty five pounds, if you can figure what eighty five pound -- maybe a child looks like?
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  So [LAUGH] um and uh we had her before we had kids.  
R:  Okay.
L:  It was like our child.  So --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- um [LAUGH].
R:  So then you have kids younger than ten?
L:  Yes.  
R:  They -- does the dog like them?
L:  Yes.  
R:  They like the dog?
L:  Um -- yes.  If you were to get a dog, um, if you were [LAUGH] um, Labs make really good pets for kids because they have a good temperament.
R:  I -- the only animal -- well, I had -- we had different dogs -- I had different pets growing up, not my choice.  They were -- we had um -- oh, an Old English Sheepdog, so that was huge and that thing tackled me when I came home from school and then we had um -- I can't remember what else, and then the last dog we had, um, was a little -- like a -- a Benji type dog --
L:  Okay.
R:  Okay.  A- a- and if I had to have a dog, I'd prefer a smaller dog, but my friend has a -- a Shih-Tzu.
L:  Okay?
R:  Oh, my gosh.  I -- I -- I actually came home and said I would briefly consider it --
L:  Oh [LAUGH].
R:  -- because that dog was -- it's a -- it's a joke because when I go over to this house with my golf pro, this dog just comes right up to me and every -- all of them know I don't like dogs, don't like cats, don't like pets, don't want 'em, and this dog just doesn't seem to know that and just --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- snuggles right up next to me and last time it was really cute, so --
L:  I grew up with dogs.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  And -- but I also wanted a small dog when I was coming to get this one.
R:  Oh, oh.
L:  The problem was is that we knew the people um who our dog's mother was --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- and my husband wanted a big dog.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And we went over there and they were selling them.  They just had a sign on the street.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And um they had a boy dog and a girl dog at that time and my husband was, like, well you know, what do you think?  And I'm holding the girl dog because I decided I would take a girl and somebody drove up into the cul de sac that they live on and yelled out, "Do you have any girl dogs left?"  [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.  
L:  And I looked at him and I said, "No".  [LAUGH].  
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  So it was like, okay, I was holding it, I was suckered, you know?  I got that -- so [LAUGH]. 
R:  So um do you have room for the dog to ro- like, do they need to -- space outside to run --
L:  Our dog's a house dog.
R:  Oh, you -- you made it a house dog?
L:  Yeah.  She is --
R:  I think my daughter's boyfr- no, my -- I only have -- she's sixteen, I think that's what he has and they only have a small yard, but I don't believe -- I mean, I hear that he has to walk the dog or whatever, but I -- the dog's mostly a house dog.
L:  Right.  Our dog sleeps on --
R:  What --
L:  -- the couch with a bed pillow.
R:  Yeah.  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH].  So --
R:  Okay.
L:  With a pillow okay?
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  And um I walked her in the mornings, um, before we had kids and I used to get up early in the morning and I would walk for like a half hour --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- forty five minutes before we would leave for the day.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but that's just a habit that she's gotten into, so we still get up between five thirty and six o'clock in the morning --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and walk, and that's like her and mine alone time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  And now --
R:  Away from the kids.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And um, she does run a little bit now and again.  We have a -- a little bit more than a half acre of a yard.
R:  Oh, so that's not too bad.
L:  Right.  And --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um -- but she's kind of -- we keep her on a leash, we don't let --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- her roam.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um --
R:  Yeah, that's scary when the dogs walk past your house unattended.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Well, we have um -- our subdivision that we live in has about fifty one homes and I'm gonna say that we probably have a good forty dogs.
R:  Wow.
L:  And some houses at least have two.
R:  So you're -- I wouldn't want to live there.  Oh.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  
R:  So wha- what's your other pet?
L:  We have um Japanese fighting fish. 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Bader fish.
R:  Okay.
L:  My kids each have one.
R:  Okay.  
L:  And um they're --
R:  That's sort of like -- I don't know, I don't know if I call that a pet more than a decoration.
L:  Well, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  Well, yeah, to them they're a pet.  I mean, you know --
R:  Yeah, I know.  Yeah.  I -- I -- I'd try to sell that to my kids, too.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  As a pet.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  Well, they liked them.  They each have their own and we have them on our dinner table at night and --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  And um they do see one another's reflections at time -- you know, through the water, through the bases that they're in, and they puff up at one another, so it's kind of interesting to see that that's probably --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- how they would react with other fish around, but --
R:  That's cool.
L:  But they're very -- so, you know, obviously you know about them, then, a little bit?  They're sedentary.  You can't put them in with other fish.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  And uh we have small little lasers on our -- on a like sort of our dinner table at night and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- with the flowers and on the colored racks, they're -- and especially the glass beads at the bottom, so when they're --
R:  Sounds pretty.
L:  They're pretty easy to feed.  I mean, you take a toothpick and you dip it in water and then you --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- dip it in the food and that's how much food they get a day [LAUGH] so --
R:  Oh, wow.  
L:  So they're cheap eaters compared to my dog.
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  'Cause --
R:  So, who of course, yeah, you have to make plans for if you're going out of town and --
L:  Well, yeah.  That's part of the problem that we have.  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think if we had a littler dog, we might have a little bit easier time, but we have a retired couple that moved in next door by us now --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they're pretty good at um, you know, taking her out if they're home and --
R:  So you're able to -- see, that's one reason -- well, aside from the fact I've never been a pet person, that having to deal with not just up and going somewhere when you want to, and having to think about the pet.  Now, I'm not like that about kids [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  Well --
R:  But, yeah -- but --
L:  Um --
R:  -- but -- but for --
L:  -- my --
R:  -- pets, you know, it'd be like, oh that constant having to be responsible and remember, you know, and find somebody and have that all set up and that would be --
L:  Well -- well --
R:  -- hard.
L:  -- when we first got our dog, part of the arrangement was with the people who we had gotten her from, if we were going on vacation, like, two months afterwards and we had asked --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if they would be able to just keep her 'cause they had a pen in their yard.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And um they didn't have a problem with it and like the first three years that we had her, whenever we would go on vacation we would just take her there.
R:  So that was very handy.
L:  Right.  But then what they did is they had had another litter of pups and they decided to keep two --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so to have four Labs at their house was way too many dogs [LAUGH] for a week.
R:  Right.
L:  And so that kind of restricted us and we have a neighbor that also has a Lab that we take turns watching one another's dog, but --
R:  Well, that works good too, 'cause it's not so -- like, it costs -- it costs so much to board, I know.
L:  Well, not only that, it's -- it's really stressful on them and it's better if you can keep them in your own home --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and stuff.  The problem is --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- I feel really guilty [LAUGH] being gone for a week, so for the last two years and -- and including this year, what we've done is we um -- we have found a place um up in northern Wisconsin that'll let us bring our dog [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.  
L:  And so she comes with us so the ride up there is about eight hours from --
R:  So do you have a van?
L:  Right.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Full size or mini van?
L:  I have a Grand Caravan.
R:  Okay. 
L:  And --
R:  I have a whole size van which I fill with kids, not pets, but --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- I think you'd need -- yeah, that -- you'd need that -- yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  Right.  Well, by the time we put our kids in there and we have --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we have a kennel that we bring with her.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, you know, that --
R:  Wow, you fill it up.
L:  We fill it up, yeah [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  And we have the T.V. and you know --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- all that kind of junk that you need in there.  Um, and it's about an eight hour ride from where we live, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um along the way when we're stopping and the dog, every stop we make, goes crazy 'cause she thinks we're there, but when she's there, she's fine.  Um, in fact uh, the lodge that we stayed at doesn't have a problem with her coming.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, we have to pay, have this security fee just in case she would damage something, but um she's just been very good there.  She doesn't bark.  She's a shedder.  That's one bad thing about her.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, her mother supposedly was not a bad shedder, but our dog has appeared to be um pretty bad.  She's really hard on a vacuum cleaner so [LAUGH] --
R:  You probably have to vacuum a lot more than or --
L:  Well --
R:  -- or --
L:  -- I go and I do once a week.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, so you just -- okay.  That -- that works for me, too.
L:  [LAUGH].  I'm not a big -- I'm not a big house cleaner.  
R:  That's not the most important thing in the world.  
L:  Right.  
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  My husband uh -- my husband travels a lot and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with my two small kids, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And if you're -- yeah.  
L:  Right.
R:  And a dog.  Once a week is plenty [LAUGH].
L:  Right.  That's the way I look at it.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  And um -- and she eats like twice a day and does uh --
R:  Is she a very expensive -- like, food wise?
L:  Oh, no.
R:  And vet bills and all that?
L:  Well, the vet bills I think for any kind of animal um nowadays are just outrageous.
R:  Really?
L:  Think of vets is like taking um -- like, when you go to the doctor, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they offer insurance and stuff, but --
R:  Do they really?
L:  Yeah.  There is insurance --
R:  Yeah?  Different.
L:  -- that you can take out, um, to help pay, but --
R:  But still --
L:  -- um, yeah, we've had -- we've had some problems and it's kind of -- it kinda adds to the fact, like you were talking about when you would have to go on vacation to try and find somebody to watch your dog?
R:  Mhm?
L:  It's an added thing --
