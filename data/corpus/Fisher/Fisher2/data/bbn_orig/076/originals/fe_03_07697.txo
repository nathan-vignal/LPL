R:  Uh, Cheryl Seabock.[?]
L:  Hi, I'm Arlene Miller.  I live in, um -- in Pokatoe[?], Idaho.  Where do you live?
R:  Oh, Baltimore, Maryland.
L:  Oh, okay.  Um [LIPSMACK], are you, um -- are you married?  Single?
R:  I'm married with one child.  You?
L:  Um, I'm married with two children, um, a sixteen year old and a twenty one year old.  Uh, this is my, um, second marriage, but I didn't have children with the first marriage.
R:  Oh, well, yeah, this is my first.  I've been with, um, my husband for, um -- for twenty two years I believe, but we've only been married for like the last seven.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  Okay.  But you've been together all those years?
R:  Yes.
L:  So, you've really been ...  Yeah.  So, that's almost like [LAUGH] being married.
R:  We're the complete -- and we're the complete opposite.  So, opposites do attract believe me.
L:  Oh, okay.  Um, so what do you think is -- is really important?  How do you manage to stay together?
R:  Um, best, uh -- I guess being best of friends as well as, you know, lovers.  But, um, we're always stuck together.  I mean, even though we disagree we always seem to make up and it's just, uh -- I don't know.  [LAUGH]  We -- we're strong.  It's a strong relationship.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We've been through a lot.
L:  And I agree what you said about being, uh, best friends.  Um, I was married once before and -- for like six years and I don't think we were friends at all and then I decided I could survive by myself, I didn't need anybody, and then I met a guy and we were just good friends for a long time and then we started dating and, um, so I think that's made a big difference 'cause I can tell him anything and he can tell me anything.
R:  Well, I -- I -- I and, um -- my husband was married before, uh, he's, uh, older than I am, like fifteen years older than me --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and he -- you know, I was eighteen when I met him and he wined and dined and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- opened the car doors.  So, you know?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But -- but when you get married that all goes away [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- in some relationships.
L:  Well, I think maybe you're more comfortable.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I think that's what it is.  That's what it is.
L:  You don't have to impress the other person.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, it's, uh -- he has three other children, twin boys and a daughter that are older.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But -- but, um, you know, we all got -- get along.  So, that's a good thing.
L:  But was that hard getting -- with the other, um -- having the other children come into your house was that hard?
R:  Well, when we -- yeah, when we first got together I was only twenty three and I think the boys were like fourteen or might've been a little older.  But, yeah, um, the one boy we got along -- we -- we still do get along great and the other one just [MN] is a hard head.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, um, the daughter, you know, she lives in California and -- and me and my daughter -- our daughter, me and my husband's daughter, we went and visited.  We went to California, then we went to Disneyland and we met them here.  He won't fly so he didn't go.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, um, yeah, we get along.  I -- I was scared to death that she wouldn't like me, the oldest daughter.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it all worked out.  It really just worked out.  So, I guess we're blessed with that.
L:  Oh, I admire you for that.  You know, sometimes I think a marriage can be hard enough, but when you marry someone who's been married before and has children wow, that's ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, did you talk about that before you really started getting serious about --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- about how you were gonna handle ...?
R:  Yeah.  I kinda worried that they wouldn't like me and he said they just want me to be happy.  So, um, it kinda worked that way.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It really -- it worked out.  I mean, I was younger, but I didn't see them -- you know, I'm only four years older than his daughter.
L:  Right.
R:  So -- so ...  But we email each other and we talk and, um, she treats my daughter really well.
L:  That's ...
R:  I just wish we lived closer, you know?
L:  Right.  Yeah.  That's neat.  That's, um ...  So, when have you seen them last?  When did you ...?
R:  Um [LIPSMACK], his son I seen, uh, a year ago December.
L:  Mhm.
R:  He came in with his Dad and they went hunting and all.  But his daughter I haven't seen for a couple of years now.  But she used to come in all the time.  But I won't fly.  She wanted my daughter to -- my daughter's only ten -- her to come out [LAUGH], but I won't send her on a plane alone.
L:  Right.
R:  But now that -- after nine eleven I just can't fly, but ...
L:  That really bothers you?
R:  Not right now.  Yeah.  Not right now anyway.  But everything ...
L:  Does it bother y- -- does it bother your husband to fly?
R:  To fly?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  He won't admit it.  Yeah, I know it does.  But he won't admit.  He won't ever -- I've never been on a plane with him.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.  But, um, it's -- you know, it's hard, um, and now like a guy I work with if you wanna talk about partnerships he's -- he's gay, but him and his friend, uh, you've never seen a better couple.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They just -- you know, it's just -- there's a lotta people envy them.
L:  Oh, I -- I think -- I don't -- you know, I don't think it matters if you're --
R:  In love.
L:  -- if you're gay, if you're straight, um, if you have a good relationship wow, it's worth -- oh [LAUGH] -- 
R:  I'm telling ya.
L:  -- yeah, there's no amount of money that could pay for that.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Nothing more better than love and, you know, family.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  But, you know, all -- all we have is like each other.  I lost my Mom and now just lost my sister but, um ...
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  She was only forty eight.  So, basically, uh, all we have is each other and that helps --
L:  Right.
R:  -- 'cause we stick together so much.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But -- and no matter whatever we do or -- we're always by each other's side, always.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So ...
L:  That's neat.  Do you, um, tell him things that you [SIGH] ...?  Before I married him I was such a secretive person and I am finally getting to the point where I can tell him things that real- -- that I hate to admit to anybody.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I have -- I have no problem telling him.  I tell him everything.
L:  Oh.
R:  I've always been an open person.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I've never one to keep -- keep things.  No, I tell him.  He knows my whole life and ...
L:  Right.
R:  Now him he -- he's a little bit hard to, uh -- you know, talk about, like he won't -- he won't talk about any of his ex's or anything, he won't -- he don't want to discuss anything like that.
L:  Well, that's probably okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I guess so.  Yeah.
L:  Maybe you don't wanna know.  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.  But I -- I find it really, really hard to even admit some things to myself and sometimes when I'm really upset my husband has a hard time getting it out of me, uh, and then I feel better when I talk about it.  But, man, it'll be ...
R:  And usually it's the opposite.
L:  Yeah.  With -- with you, you just spit it out?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I tell him.  I mean -- and now he's talking a lot more to me too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, yeah, I, uh ...  The only thing like with me and him I think, uh -- the only fight that we really have is when we bring money up.  We cannot discuss money 'cause, you know ...
L:  Oh, that's hard.
R:  It really is.  Um, it's like, "Well, what did you do with it?"  You know?  I'm like I paid the bills [several inaudible words] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and so we try to stay off that topic.
L:  Do -- do you work outside the home?
R:  Um, yes.  Yeah.  We both have fulltime jobs and, um, you know, coming home and then I got six animals.  So, it's difficult and I get stressed a lot.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  Well, is the cost of living real high there, so are you finding that it's hard to make ends meet?
R:  Um, I think what [SIGH] -- what the problem is is I spoil my child.  [LAUGH]  She gets like everything.  I'll do without, uh, you know, and I know it's wrong to do, but I give her like everything she wants.  He even says I give her too much, but I -- all she has is us, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  She don't have grandparents that give -- take her -- or -- or aunts or whatever takes her and does stuff with her.
L:  Right.
R:  It's just us.
L:  Your -- your sister didn't have any, um -- any kids?
R:  Yes, my sister had two kids.  Um, we, uh -- it was a bitter ending, um, with her 'cause she was -- had a boyfriend for years and, um, it was a bitter ending with him and I.  So, I don't talk to her son and my niece kinda turned on me after I practically raised her.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  So, it was -- it was a bad -- it was a bad ...
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I don't have nothing to do with either one of them.
L:  Oh, how sad.
R:  It is.  It's real sad.
L:  Oh.
R:  It's real sad.  But I've done a lot for them and, you know, they seem to forget that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I had more -- my niece more than my sister.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  She actually left my niece and her husband for this guy --
L:  Oh, gosh.
R:  -- and I -- it was something we couldn't agree on.  I would never leave my child for nobody.
L:  No.  No.  I wouldn't either.
R:  So, yeah.  And my niece seems to forget all that.  So ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  She's in her twenties now and ...
L:  Oh.  Well, you were --
R:  But ...
L:  -- you were lucky to have a daughter.  How old is your daughter?
R:  Ten.  She'll be eleven.
L:  Oh.
R:  Oh, yes.  My daughter's my best friend, as well as my husband.
L:  Uh-huh.  You -- that's neat.  That's -- that's great.
R:  Yeah.  And how 'bout you?  Tell me a little bit about you.
L:  Um --
R:  How's your kids?
L:  -- um, they're great.  They're -- you know, people say that when teenagers get to be teenagers they're awful, but no, and sometimes, you know, they didn't always wanna be with me.  They wanted to do their own things.  But, yeah, they always talk to me and they're -- they're just really neat and they talk to, um, my husband and, uh, yeah, I feel really, really fortunate.  So many of our, um, friends and, uh, my boys' friends are from divorced families and I just feel so lucky to be not divorced.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Right.
L:  To be together.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's the one thing, my Mom and Dad were married for like forty years and it's something ...
L:  Oh, neat.
R:  Yeah.  And my Mom passed away on their, um, thirty ninth anniversary.
L:  Oh.
R:  On -- on that day and they were leaving for Las Vegas that day.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  So ...  Yeah.  So, I mean, he's just -- I -- I still have my Dad, but he's not one to be real close, you know?
