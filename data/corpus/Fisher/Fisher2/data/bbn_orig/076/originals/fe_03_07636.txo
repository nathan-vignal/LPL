L:  Hello?  This is Daria from uh Burbank, California.
R:  Hi.  My name is Beverley.  I live in, uh, Burlington, Ontario, Canada.
L:  Wow.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  I've always --
L:  How'd you -- how'd you hear about this?
R:  My daughter lives in Illinois.
L:  Oh.
R:  And she uh -- she told me about it.
L:  Great.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  But I've always only spoken to people from New York.
L:  Oh, really?  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, this is California.
R:  Yeah.  Anyway, the topic is pets?
L:  Yes.
R:  Do you have a pet?
L:  Yes, I do.  I have two cats.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  One's named Freddy and one named Sammy.
R:  Okay.
L:  Sammy is uh black uh with yellow eyes.
R:  Yeah?
L:  And he's two years old and Sam -- I mean, Freddy is uh -- uh -- he's kinda like a striped --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh orange --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and uh he's like a cheetah.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  He's got long hair, uh, on his tail and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- around his ears and uh -- but the rest of him's not that long.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  He's got a huge long tail and he's --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- uh about a year and three months old.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, you have pets?
R:  Not now.  We -- in the past, we've had um -- we had a cat once and then we had a dog.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  We had a cat for quite a few years.  Uh, she was just -- actually, she looked like the uh -- the cat that used to be on the Purina box.  I don't know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- if that cat still is [LAUGH] but you know, like a -- an orangey --
L:  Like a Morris?  Morris the cat?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And um we had her until we made a move to another city and she did not adjust well at all.
L:  Right.
R:  And um she just -- she was getting older and we finally had her put down.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And then a number of years ago, about maybe nine years ago, we got a West Highland Terrier.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, and we had her for about seven years, but -- seven or eight years, but then we had to have her put down.
L:  Wow.
R:  Because she was uh -- she -- she was never good with children and my daughter had a child and so it was -- it was very awkward.  We always had to put her in -- you know, down in the basement, lock her up, when our little --
L:  Right.
R:  -- granddaughter came over and then we were also -- we were concerned, you know, if she ever nipped another -- another child or -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And she was just getting uh -- she was getting nasty.  I was the one that looked after her all the time.  Even though it was my son's dog, I was the one that -- she was white, so she had to be bathed quite frequently and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- she just got that she didn't like to be bathed, she didn't like to be groomed and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- she would snap.  So -- 
L:  [COUGH].
R:  -- it -- it -- when a pet is like that, you just don't -- it -- you know, I love animals, but I didn't -- over the years I didn't get so attached to her because of her -- her nature.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Yeah, you really need -- it's nice to have a pet, but you know, it's not like that.  She was a pretty dog, a really pretty dog, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh it just -- she just got too hard to handle.  But and then --
L:  Yeah, when I was -- when I was younger, I had a uh -- a part German Shepherd, part um -- oh, it was mostly German Shepherd --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- named Duke and he -- he had a high strung personality, too.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
L:  Um, we -- the dog catcher got him [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, ho.
L:  Uh, in the pound.  That was when I was younger and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so I didn't have a dog again, but I did have uh -- my sister had a Dalmatian named Kippy --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and he was very good natured.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And he loved me more than he loved her.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  She lived a block away.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um uh, I don't know what happened to him.  I don't remember what they did, but --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  -- uh, but I've had lots of cats.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, since I was young and uh the oldest cat, uh, was Marilyn.  She lived seventeen years.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow.  Yeah --
L:  And --
R:  -- it's really nice to have a cat.  We had uh -- before I was married, I brought home a -- a puppy once.  I -- I couldn't believe I had the nerve to do it, but even after I got married, my parents still had that dog and -- and she was just a -- you know, a mutt really.  She wasn't a thoroughbred or anything, but she was a really good dog and a -- a very affectionate dog.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it was hard when she got sick and my dad had to put her down.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But after the last episode with the dog, I ju- I -- we lead kind of -- our lives are quite busy and you know, when you go away with -- you got to find someone to look after your dog or put them in a kennel and --
L:  Yeah.  Cats are easier that way.
R:  Cats are easier.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's true.  My daughter has a cat and uh you know, if they go away, they can leave for a few days and -- and the cat will be fine.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And uh if they go longer, you know, a neighbor can come in, but she doesn't have to be coming in every day.
L:  Right.  
R:  But I think animals are great, but uh --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- I just -- [LAUGH].
L:  I know.  It's hard when you get attached to 'em and something happens to 'em.
R:  Yeah, but I --
L:  That's the rough part.
R:  I learnt to -- you know, I -- I just got -- I think if you're gonna have an animal or -- I don't know so much with a cat, but especially with a dog, you really need to make sure, you know, what kind of a dog you're getting and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- we didn't do a whole lot of research on the -- the breed when we got the West Highland Terrier.
L:  Right.
R:  And West Highland Terriers, some of them are very docile and are really good and others are very high strung, like ours was.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And yappy and you know?  So it's uh -- it is nice to have pets, but uh they just take work.
L:  [LAUGH].  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  This -- these uh cats today are different from the cats uh I had when I was a child.  They -- they seem -- the cats then seemed much more loving and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and everything.  Now the cats are uh they're -- they got in- well, super independent uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- uh, personality, not the most loving.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, now as they get older, they're getting better.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  'Cause they're boys.  They're both boys.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  You know, and that -- I think that makes a difference, too, 'cause girl cats --
R:  Well -- I've often --
L:  Did you know that calico cats are only girls?
R:  Is that right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, I didn't know that.
L:  There's no calico boys.
R:  Oh.  
L:  Just -- it's all girls.
R:  Well, I often wondered about cats.  Like, I like cats if they're affectionate, you know?
L:  Mhm.  
R:  The cat we had, she was really quite independent and uh you know, she'd come around when she knew you were gonna feed her and whatnot, but she really --
L:  Right.
R:  -- wasn't a friendly cat.  She was an independent cat.
L:  Right.
R:  And my daughter's cat is kind of the same, and yet I was just down there looking after her children while she and her husband went on a little holiday, and the cat ha never bothered with me, which really -- you know, 'cause I love animals, and that --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- cat would never bother with me.
L:  Right.
R:  But when they were away, I couldn't believe it.  She was coming around and she wanted me to pat her.  So that was really different.  That -- their cat --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- has never been like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that with me, but I --
L:  They're funny that way, boy --
R:  Yeah, they really are.  
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  But uh, but no, cats are you know -- I think if you're gonna have a cat, although my husband would never want a cat, he doesn't like cats.
L:  Oh.
R:  The one we had, it was our son's and someone gave it to him, but he'd like to have, you know, one of these great big dogs, but --
L:  Oh, uh-huh.
R:  -- I said, no, I don't want a big dog.
L:  Right.  
R:  I can't --
L:  They'll -- they'll eat you out of house and home, I think.
R:  Yeah, and they take care, you know?  They really -- you really -- you need to walk them.  You --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And um they need room to run around and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and then there's -- they're costly, too.  You know, you gotta --
L:  Mhm.
R:  There's a lot of things you have to do with -- with animals that uh -- it add -- it adds up.
L:  Yeah, especially these days, where we have all these laws now, so --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you gotta really uh you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- uh -- we have a little pet, they wear tags, they're just like doggies.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Huh, and um --
R:  Do you have to have a license for a dog where you are?  'Cause here you have to have a -- you're supposed --
L:  Yeah, for a dog.
R:  -- to have a license.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, but not for a cat.
R:  Not for a cat, no.
L:  Right.
R:  That's the way it is here, too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But you have to have uh -- you have to have a license for a dog.  Um, oh there was something else I was going to ask you, but -- I guess your cats are -- they stay in all the time, right?
L:  No, no.
R:  Oh, they go out?  Oh.
L:  They're in -- indoor, outdoor.
R:  Okay.  
R:  Yeah, that's the way our cat was.  She would always come in at night.  She'd come to the door and come in.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  She never stayed out at night, but she'd roam around during the day and she'd go to the neighbor's house because they loved cats and they had great bit white --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- Persian cat.
L:  Oh.
R:  And she'd go over there 'cause they'd feed her treats and then she'd wander back to our house.  She never really went very far, but she did go out.
L:  Mm.  Our cats are, you know, like they roam the neighborhood, but then they come back.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  And uh but Freddy, he -- he's so young that -- that I was hoping, you know, he'd meet a girl, but --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- like he had a -- his personality has not been great.
R:  Oh.
L:  It's like you know he's -- uh, he's got a bad temper and it shows in his tail.
R:  Oh.  Yeah.
L:  But now that he's getting older, he's getting better.  He's starting to purr more and be --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- be better, yeah.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  So I'm hoping he'll find a nice girlfriend before we have to get him spayed or neutered.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  You know?  [LAUGH].  And we already got uh Sammy uh neutered.
R:  Yeah.  So how long did you say you've had these cats?
L:  Well uh, Sammy is two years old --
R:  Yeah, that's right.
L:  And uh Freddy's a year and three months.
R:  Oh.  So did you have cats before you had --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah, so you've always --
L:  Uh, from the time I was nine --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- I had cats.  Uh, I had tiger, rag, for eleven years.  He was so -- uh, he was such a great cat.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, oh unfortunately he -- he was uh -- uh, the ladies' man uh all over -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- all over the neighborhood and got a bunch of cats pregnant --
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH].
L:  -- and got in cat fights with the males, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- uh after eight years, we got him uh neutered.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And uh then he was getting blind by the uh -- the time he was eleven --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and unfortunately he got hit.
R:  Oh.  Okay.
L:  And uh then Marilyn, like I -- uh, she was a Calico.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And she was with us for years and then I -- we gave her to my sister and she's the one that lived seventeen years.
R:  Okay. 
L:  Yeah, and uh we had a white cat that was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- named Tony when I was young and he was a big, white cat, but he --
