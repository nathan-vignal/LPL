L:  Hello?
R:  Yes.
L:  Hi, I'm Pam.
R:  Hi, um, this is Roger Barnes.
L:  Hi, how ya doing?
R:  Okay.
L:  That's good.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Well, with the topic is [PAUSE] life partner.
R:  Okay.
L:  Okay.  Basically what I think of -- of life partner is, is basically you [inaudible] have in a relationship, is being honest for one thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, having a commitment.
R:  Yes.
L:  Um, probably, you know, compatible.  Being able to enjoy doing the same thing or, you know, compromising.
R:  Yes.
L:  And doing different things.  Uh, that's probably what I think, uh, a life partner sh- you know, should be.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Someone that's there.  You can always go to and talk to and -- and someone that's gonna be there for you.
R:  That's right.  That's what I believe in too.
L:  Uh-huh.  [MN] So, what do you think?
R:  Uh, I think that, uh, [MN] [MN] you have to be [COUGH] -- like you said, you have to honest with o- with one another.
L:  Right.
R:  You have to be able to share, er, things bec- -- and you have to b- be able c- to, uh, communicate.
L:  Yes.
R:  Because if there's no communication there's always gonna be a problem.
L:  That's it.
R:  And it's always a matter of, uh -- matter of trust, you know.
L:  That's it.
R:  There's, uh -- you just can't trust anybody, you know --
L:  That's it.
R:  -- when it comes to, uh, relationships as well as people that you just m- meet daily, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or work with for that matter.
L:  Oh.
R:  And I think that's -- it's -- it's very essential to, uh, be able to, uh, relate to one another, uh, and share things.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they may not no- necessarily agree with everything but as long as you communicate with one another and so that way vis -- -- uh, the things that you may, uh, disagree with or you may, duh -- your disa- d- likes and dislikes are aired.
L:  That's true.
R:  You know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- at least, uh, uh, there's no miscommunication or -- or misinterpreting --
L:  Right.
R:  -- one's, uh, m- moods or, uh -- or what they have to say.
L:  Right.  Uh, I was -- like I was, um, watching Oprah one day and -- and she had a -- a audience full of -- of married people and she brought the question about intimacy --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I was totally shocked that a lotta married people in the audience did not know anything about intimacy.
R:  No?
L:  They did not, no.  You know, what does intimacy mean to you?
R:  Intimacy?  That's, uh -- that's, uh, uh, uh, a very personalized --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, uh, thing because I think that, uh, to be in with -- with -- with a person, you have to be able to -- to share your feelings --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, and being able to, uh, expound on your thoughts that you mon- may not necessarily share with anybody else.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  I -- I think it's -- it's essential that, uh, you as a matter as trust --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because, uh, you can't just trust anym- anyone with -- with, uh, your intimate thoughts and feelings and 'cause --
L:  That's it.
R:  -- they either don't understand or th- there's always that, uh -- that, uh, possibility that they may betray you.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in that sense, I think you have to be very careful about how [MN] -- who and -- who you trust your thoughts and feelings with.
L:  That's it.
R:  It's a -- that's the way I feel.
L:  Uh-huh.  And it's something that my Mom, Charlotte, told me.  You know, to watch your best friend, you know.  [LAUGH]
R:  True.
L:  They'll be, you know.
R:  Because sometimes -- sometimes people you hold dear to, uh -- to you the most are the ones who m- may betray you the most.
L:  That's it.
R:  You know.
L:  Definitely.
R:  It's hold, uh -- what's that old saying?  Uh, hold your -- your enemies close but hold your friends even closer.
L:  That's it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's it.  So, and, uh, basically, uh, I think that even in a relationship- relationship, you know, sex is important but [MN] at the same time it's -- it's -- it's not important.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, a lot of people get married because --
R:  For the wrong reasons.
L:  -- of infatuation, you know, uh, or they're together because, uh, sex --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, and sex doesn't make a relationship.
R:  N- no, it doesn't.  I think you have to be friends first before you [MN] go into a relationship.
L:  That's it.
R:  Because, uh, uh, I think going into a relationship [MN] just because of sex, that's -- to me, that's dumb because --
L:  That's it.
R:  -- it's not gonna last anyway.
L:  That's it.
R:  You know, because you don't even know one another.
L:  That's it and y-
R:  It's like two trains passing in the night in a way --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, because, uh -- because y- y- you say you wake up, uh, after spend, uh, that few -- those few minutes with that person, you don't still -- you still don't know who they are.
L:  That's it.
R:  And how can you trust or -- or -- or confide in a person you don't know?
L:  That's it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, and -- and, you know, I look at a lot of these movie stars today.  You know, they get married for maybe a week or they bet- met this person maybe six months --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they're --
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, then they move onto the next one and, you know.
R:  Yeah, and at the first thing when they're interviewed, they say -- the first thing they say is -- especially the -- th- -- when it comes to the woman, she's -- she's -- like they say, uh, "I'd -- I'd lived with that person for all this time [inaudible] and I didn't even know them."
L:  Right, right.
R:  More so -- more quickly than -- than a man would confess --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as to whether, uh -- as -- as far as admitting that, you know.
L:  That's it.
R:  I think women are far more easier to, uh -- to s- to say the honest thing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, because with -- with -- with men the -- it -- it's all about ego and how they relate to their peers, you know.
L:  That's it, that's it.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Um, basically, you know, to make a relationship work, you really gotta work at it.
R:  Yeah, mhm.
L:  You know, it's not like a part time --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- thing or --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you know, it's not like a fifty fifty, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It shouldn't even be a number --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in there.
R:  No.
L:  You know, if you're commited together with one another then, you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- know, it's something that you really have to work with at the rest of your life.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, in order to --
R: [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, make it work and, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to be happy and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, people be productive --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, so but, um, you know.  Relationship, you know, people get different ideas about relationship.
R:  Yeah, they do.
L:  But, you know, they really don't get the true meaning of r- r- relationship.
R:  Yeah, [MN] sometimes it doesn't come till -- as -- I think that it's all about, uh, bah, maturity too.
L:  That's it.  Yes, that's true --
R:  Because --
L:  -- with that.
R:  -- I think the older they -- they -- you are, the more you're inclined to, uh, be more responsible --
L:  That's it.
R:  -- and er -- and also understand --
L:  That's it.
R:  -- what it really means, you know.  For instance, someone who's just, uh -- who's -- is -- was either in their teens or in their early twenties --
L:  Right.
R:  -- who haven't, uh, gone through anything like that.
L:  Right.  And I think, uh -- I think this generation, I think they should look at the old generation.
R:  Yeah, mhm.
L:  Oh, you know -- of husband and --
R:  But they don't. 
L:  -- wife being together for twenty, thirty, forty years.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Fifty an- fiftieth anniversary, you know, and how they, you know -- th- their generation is entirely different from our generation, you know, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and we had, you know -- back there i- it was different.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You were courting and --
R: [NOISE]
L:  -- you know -- and you couldn't live together, you know, and, you know, you had to -- the- the- the guy had a [inaudible] you know, asking the h- the Dad --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for the girl's hand and the Dad wanna know who, you know, the person was and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know -- and it's not like that today, you know.
R:  [NOISE] No, it's not.
L:  And there's no respect today, you know
R:  Right.
L:  Even in relationship, they don't respect one another.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, and I think that's really, you know --
R:  Well, they don't -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- they just don't take it seriously.
L:  That's it, you know.
R:  It's just the mean- -- th- th- that I imagine for some of them, i- it's just a m- it's just a word -- it's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- doesn't, uh, really have -- doesn't hold any real credence as to whether it means anything, or not.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, and, uh, it's -- it's, uh -- and that [inaudible] -- in that sense it's -- it's taken out of context --
L:  Right.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And, uh, j- they -- it -- it may take a while, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, uh, it may take the ten or more years, uh, before th- -- some people finally realize, er, uh, the significance of it all.
L:  That's it, yeah.  And I -- I remember on one talk show there's one lady said that she just m- -- she's been married to this person for like twelve --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- thirteen year and still don't know the person.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, you still [LAUGH] -- you know, you can be +married -- be married a long time and still --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- not really know that person, you know
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, it takes a lifetime, you know.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Maybe until -- maybe until death do you part till you really know that person inside and out.
R:  Yeah, and al- also too, it -- it -- it's a matter of, um, uh, has a lot to do w- with respect and everything too --
L:  That's it.
R:  -- because -- and, uh, being able to, [LIPSMACK] uh, determine th- [MN] [MN] uh, [MN] uh, one's feelings towards one another too --
L:  Right.
R:  You know, 'cause, uh, uh, a lot -- often times th- that's -- that's kinda lacking, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, and, uh, [MN] personally, you know, it's -- it -- I -- I see this sort of -- sort of thing happening all the time, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  A- around me.  I feel -- I feel like I'm in a fishbowl --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, on -- on the outside looking in.
L:  Right.
R:  You know.  And --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- then -- then I'm, uh -- I'm bound and determined not to make the same mistakes as -- as a lot of people that I know --
L:  That's it.
R:  -- do make, you know, because, uh, y- I -- I tend -- because I don't want it to happen to me.
L:  Mhm.  Well, for myself, I -- I think I like the old school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.  I -- I do like the old school because I do, you know, feel, you know -- expect a person to respect me --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, to treat me, you know, as I should be treated.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, and nowadays you don't see people, you know.  You don't see guys treating the women, you know, with respect and you don't see the women treating the guys with respect.
R:  Yeah --
L:  You know, it's stopped.
R:  -- well, a -- a lot of us are -- are -- I've noticed -- I know- I've known a lot of women who [MN] -- who have, um, evolved from bad relationships and so they --
L:  Yeah, they're -- yeah.
R:  --they have a certain, uh, uh -- what's that word I'm thinking of?  Uh, they're either -- they either have a lot of anger.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Or they -- they're, uh, so scarred either emotionally or physically or both, that, uh, they don't trust anybody.  [MN] They --
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  -- they -- when some women tend to p- put -- put, uh, all men in the same category.
L:  That's true.
R:  And I think that's a -- that's a little unfair as well but, uh, they're, um, basing their whole opinion --
