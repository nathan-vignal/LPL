R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  Who -- this is Cissy.
R:  Hi, this is Kathy.
L:  Hi.
R:  How are you?
L:  Fine.  How are you?
R:  Not too bad.  So, do you have any pets?
L:  Yes.  I have a dog, five cats, two hamsters and a chicken.
R:  Wow.  
L:  [LAUGH].  Yeah, I --
R:  That's a lot of pets.
L:  -- live in a zoo [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  That's quite a few pets [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].  I live in a area where people dump 'em off and I just kinda take 'em in.
R:  Oh.  So you're -- you're like the -- the good Samaritan?
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, that's great [LAUGH].  I personally don't have any pets, but uh, my sister does and I -- I love them just as much as if they were my own.
L:  Yes.
R:  Uh, they have a Pomeranian, uh, there's a pit bull which is a little bit, you know, bothersome, and then a uh -- a Chihuahua [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, they're cute.
R:  Yeah.  So they're very cute.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Mine's a Miniature Schnauzer.  
R:  Oh, how old is your Schnauzer?   
L:  She's a year and a half.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.  She's still kind of a baby [LAUGH].
R:  Really?  Are they hard to take care of?
L:  They're real hyper, a Schnauzer is.  I bought her for my mom for Christmas --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and my mom's a truck driver and she gave her back.
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, gosh.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  She started eating her truck, so [LAUGH] it's --
R:  Oh well, that's not good.
L:  -- just -- no.  It's not enough space for a Schnauzer.  They -- they have a lot of energy.
R:  Yeah.  My sister has a Pomeranian and she um -- the -- the little guy, he's just uh -- he's just a little -- he's just really -- he -- he needs to be with someone, like, all the time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But uh, you know, he's really good about, you know, showing a lot of affection and like the thing is that he just yaps a lot, but he's very pretty [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, they are pretty.  They're real --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- pretty dogs.
R:  Yeah.  He looks like a little show dog [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, they're beautiful dogs.  
R:  But uh, then there's a Chihuahua, but he's -- he's not -- he's -- he's not really a miniature Chihuahua, he's sort of bigger than a Chihuahua --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but he's got big, black eyes and -- and then there's the big dog.  The uh --
L:  Yeah, that is a big dog.
R:  Yeah.  It's a huge dog.  I mean, when my sister first got him, um, he was just really small and then all of a sudden he just started getting really big so it's like we -- I think they nickname him "The Monster".
L:  [LAUGH].  
R:  [LAUGH] 'cause when they bring him out, he just jumps around everywhere [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  
R:  And then he runs around into the living room and he ends up making himself comfortable on the couch.
L:  [LAUGH] yeah.
R:  [LAUGH].  So it's like his place to -- to hang out [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  I used to have two Labs and they were huge.
R:  Really?
L:  And they used to pretty much boot you off the couch [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, pretty much.  I think uh -- uh, from what I was told, they um -- they like to sleep with you.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  They know that the -- uh, the little Pomeranian, uh, used to sleep with me, he'd always just like try to jump on the bed and kinda like make himself comfortable.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But the big one, when he gets on the bed, he knocks everybody off [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  
R:  So it -- so I can only imagine what that's like [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  Yeah, that's a big dog to be having in the bed.
R:  Oh, God.  How do you get enough time to take care of all those pets?
L:  Well, it's not easy [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I didn't -- I mean, you got quite a few of them.  I mean, you have a bunch of cats, right?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, five cats.  They pretty much take care of their self, though.
R:  Yeah, they're pretty self sufficient, right?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  I've never -- I've never owned a cat, but it sounded like more that they can, you know, sort of be on their own without any problem.  
L:  Yeah.  Cats are pretty easy.
R:  Really?
L:  That's why I have more of them than I do dogs.  Dogs take a whole lot more time.
R:  What type of cat do you have?  
L:  Um --
R:  Or cats?  Are they all the same or are they different?
L:  No, I got a couple calicoes and then just -- just regular old alley cats.  
R:  Oh.  Okay.
L:  And when my -- my -- one of my calicoes, she just dumped a surprise on me the other day and had one baby.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So I've never had a cat that's only had one baby before.  I didn't even know she was pregnant.
R:  Wow.  Are -- are all the cats uh -- are they a mix, male, female?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.  I got two females -- well, three females now, and two males.
R:  Wow.  Oh, that's cute.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] yeah, but the baby, it just opened up its eyes the other day.  It's cute.
R:  Oh, so are you going to keep the baby?
L:  Probably.  
R:  Really?
L:  [LAUGH].  My daughter's as -- as crazy over animals as I am, so --
R:  [LAUGH].  And -- and what's with the chicken?  [LAUGH].
L:  Well, I used to have a hundred of 'em.
R:  Oh, be -- oh, wow.
L:  And -- yeah [LAUGH].
R:  Is it because you live in a -- in a area, like a farm or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  That makes sense.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Where -- where are you, by the way?
L:  Uh, White Top, Virginia.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And uh -- well, my neighbor's dog started getting after my chickens and stuff, so I started getting rid of some of them and it was a -- it was too much trouble.  I had two pigs and then all the chickens and it was just getting to be too much.  
R:  Yeah, that's a lot a upkeep.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a lot a money, too.  They're expensive --
R:  Is it?
L:  -- believe it or not.
R:  Really?
L:  Yes.  They're very expensive.
R:  What, the pigs?
L:  Yeah, and the chickens.
R:  Oh.  What's so expensive about it?  It --
L:  Just the feed.
R:  And the feed, is that -- oh, because it's -- you buy it in bulk or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's just real --
L:  Yeah, and they just -- they eat constant.  
R:  Oh.
L:  They never stop.
R:  They never stop eating?
L:  No, they never stop.  It's just constant.
R:  That's why they get to big?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH] oh, gosh.  
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, no.
L:  But I got rid of all my chickens and this was one of them I couldn't catch, so he just kinda hangs around [LAUGH].
R:  He's like, your chick companion?
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]. 
R:  Okay [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, I just throw him out a little bit of feed every now and then.  He's not expensive [LAUGH].
R:  Well, that's good.  Did -- do they lay any eggs or --
L:  No.  He's a rooster.
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, never mind.
L:  [LAUGH].  
R:  [LAUGH] so do you get that crow in the morning?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Do they crow, like, all the time or just once in a while?
L:  Just uh --
R:  Or just the -- early in the morning?
L:  -- like in the mornings and then right before he goes to roost at night he +crows -- crows.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Oh, yeah.  I was overseas and there was this crow -- uh, this rooster that just would not stop.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  [LAUGH] yeah.  The whole time.  I wanted to get a gun [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  
R:  And, like, shoot him.  [LAUGH].
L:  Shut him up [LAUGH].  
R:  But then he -- he had a friend, so then they would, like, chime in.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH] and it -- it got worse.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  So I --
L:  Well, yes, I go out here and crow at this one, he'll crow back.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  So you have dogs, the cats, chicken -- did you ha- say you had another pet?  
L:  Hamsters.
R:  Oh.  And how many of them do you have?
L:  Just two.  
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah.  We just have two of those.  We -- we got the where -- well, we thought we had two males --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- and turned out that one of them was a female.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah, and it turned really quick to where we had about thirty of them.
R:  Oh.  So you had to give them all away?
L:  Yeah, yeah.  
R:  Oh.
L:  We found homes real quick.
R:  Wow.
L:  'Cause I've never seen anything multiply like those things do.  
R:  Oh, wha- how old are the hamsters?
L:  Um, I guess they're about a year, maybe.
R:  Oh, okay.  Mm.  Uh, are they hard to keep?
L:  No.
R:  No?
L:  No, they're easy.  If you can put up with hearing the noise at night from them in the wheel --
R:  Oh, okay.  Just the wheel turning?
L:  Yeah, because --
R:  You got one of those spin wheels?
L:  -- they -- they only -- they're only active at night.  
R:  Why at night only?
L:  Uh, they're nocturnal.  They sleep all day and --
R:  Oh, I didn't know that.
L:  -- go all right.  Yeah.
R:  Huh.
L:  I didn't know that either till we got some.
R:  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, I never knew that.  I -- I -- I would think that they -- they'd be like on all day long?  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, that's what I thought, too, but no, they sleep all day and they go all night.
R:  Oh, gosh.  That must be interesting.  Well, I guess -- do you have the hamsters in your rooms or --
L:  No, uh-huh.
R:  Okay.  Well, that's good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Otherwise you'll never go to sleep [LAUGH].
L:  No.  Well, you get used to it after a while, too.  I really don't pay any attention to it any more.
R:  [LAUGH].  Do you -- you have, like, fish do you?
L:  No.
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH].
L:  No.  That's how we ended up with the hamster.  My daughter had a frog, an aquatic frog and --
R:  She had a frog?
L:  Yeah, she won it in a contest.
R:  Oh.
L:  And it lived in water constantly --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and she got it when she was in kindergarten and it died when she was in the seventh grade.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And uh she decided she wanted to try hamsters.  After the frog.
R:  And it -- and does she --
L:  So --
R:  -- uh like that better?
L:  Uh, no, actually I think she liked the frog better.
R:  So you think she's going to end up getting a frog?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  Yeah, she doesn't mess with the hamsters much.  They're no fun [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, because it's only at night --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and she's probably too tired by that time, right.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Oh.  
L:  Yeah, so she don't fool with them much.  I pretty much got stuck with taking care of them.  
R:  Oh, gosh.  So do you, like, ever leave the house, because you have all of these, uh, pets that are -- that -- well, I mean, especially with like the dog?
L:  Yeah.  I work.  But I can't go on vacation or anything like that.
R:  Wow.  That must be hard?
L:  Ah, I'm a homebody anyway.
R:  Are you?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Oh [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, I don't like to go anywhere [LAUGH]. 
R:  Well, then you have a lot of company.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  Yeah.  Matter of fact, my daughter's been in Pennsylvania for two weeks.  She got -- went up there with my mom --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I think I would've just absolutely died of loneliness if it wasn't for all these animals.
R:  Oh, wow.  Well, how long have you been um -- how long have you had all the animals?  I mean, I know that you -- you -- 
L:  Well, my oldest cat is nine.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So and I got her when she was just barely weaned.  
R:  Mm.
L:  So she's -- she's pretty -- getting up there pretty good.
R:  How long do cats live?  Do you --
L:  Well, normally if they're indoor, outdoor --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- they say seven or eight years.
R:  Oh.
L:  And if they're just indoor, then they say about ten years, but like I said, she's a little over nine and she's indoor, outdoor --
