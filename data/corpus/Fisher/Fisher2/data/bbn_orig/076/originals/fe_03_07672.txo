R:  Hi, I'm Wanda Schaffer from Birmington, New Mexico.
L:  Hi, I'm Nancy from California.
R:  You have any pets, Nancy?
L:  I have one cat and I have chickens.
R:  Chickens?
L:  Yeah.
R:  What kind of chickens?
L:  Chickens that give eggs.
R:  Are they pet chickens or more egg laying chickens?
L:  Well, they're both.  They're both.
R:  You wouldn't eat 'em I ...?
L:  Well, no, won't eat 'em.  I'll eat the eggs.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Do you have pets?
R:  I do.  I have, um, two dogs and a cat.
L:  Oh, all right.
R:  I never had children and I always said my children were gonna be four legged.
L:  [LAUGH] What do are their names?
R:  Um, I have a Pekinese that's Poppy.  I have a Cocker Spaniel that's Rusty and I have a black cat by the name of Spook.
L:  Oh, Spook.  [LAUGH]  Well, I have one cat.  He's gray and his name is Freeway.
R:  Freeway.  How did he get the name Freeway?
L:  Well, my daughter, uh, was the director of a cemetery and one of her customers was found dead in her apartment and she had been dead for over a week and she and her cat had been in that apartment for that long.  So, my daughter buried the lady and then felt really bad about the cat and after the funeral went back and asked the neighbors how the cat was doing and they said well, they had to find a home for the cat.  So, my daughter took the cat home, but that cat didn't get along with her cat and that's how I got it.
R:  Oh.  Are you --
L:  So ...
R:  -- are you not a regular pet kind of a person?
L:  Well, I didn't -- all I had was chickens.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I didn't have any cats, but then I felt sorry for this guy since he had been through such an ordeal and he really is a nice cat.  He's very, very old.
R:  Is he?  Oh, do you have any idea about how old he is?
L:  He's over -- according to the vet he's about seventeen years old.
R:  Ah, he's getting up there in years.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  I had a cat that lived to twenty two.
L:  Wow!  Twenty two.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, it is seven to one for cats?
R:  I'm really not sure about cats.  I think that's probably close, um, but I'm not -- I don't remember reading any kinda statistics.
L:  Oh.
R:  I know it's a rule of thumb for dogs.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Although when they're one year old it's not the equivalent of seven years old --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and it goes a little differently, um, the -- the progressing goes a little differently.  But it pretty much averages out to about seven to one.
L:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
R:  When you were growing up did you have pets?
L:  No.  I mean, I wanted to, but my Mom always said we didn't have any place for them.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, I -- I never -- I never really had a pet.  No, that's not true.  I made friends with one of the squirrels --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- that lived in -- in the tree --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so that was as close as I got.  Sounds like you've been an animal person all your life.
R:  I have been.  I have, but I'm -- and I'm a believer in, uh -- in being a two dog owner, uh --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- just it's always been -- one of the dogs that I was -- was closer to than the other and -- and when I lose one dog, um, the other one's there to kind of, uh, take up some of the -- the -- the love that I had for the other one and before that the -- be- -- and I don't always have two, but when one starts getting older then I look to get another one.  My Cocker Spaniel's the oldest one right now and he's about fourteen -- well, let's see [LIPSMACK] -- he's t- -- about twelve years old.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, um, I have a two year old Pekinese puppy -- or Pekinese that is ...
L:  Do they get along well?
R:  Yeah, they -- well, I take that back.  Um, my Pekinese is spoiled rotten --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and thinks that she rules the roost and the Cocker Spaniel is blind --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and, um, the puppy is always jumped on to -- on to Rusty or one or the other.  So, Rusty would get along fine with Poppy, but Poppy doesn't wanna get along with Rusty.
L:  How did she become blind?
R:  Um, actually, um, he had surgery.  I took him to the eye doctor, the doggie eye doctor.  He had -- Cocker Spaniels have bad tear ducts and they don't al- -- the tear ducts don't always drain and he ended up -- there's a disease where you get pressure in the eye and people get it too, um, and they test you when they -- they test your eye -- your eye sight.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They always test you for this disease, um, and the name of it, um ...
L:  Glaucoma?
R:  Yeah, Glaucoma.
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  So, he developed Glaucoma and I took him to the vet and -- or the -- the doggie vet and the doggie vet says, "Well, you know, his -- the pressure's been high enough in his eyes that -- that -- that he's blind", but he said that people talk about how painful Glaucoma is and you could only assume that it's painful in -- in dogs as well and so he had, um, surgery to relieve the pressure in his eyes.  So ...
L:  And it didn't work?
R:  It relieved the pressure, but it didn't restore his eyesight.
L:  Oh.
R:  The pressure in his eyes had caused his eyesight to go.
L:  But does he get along -- does he get around pretty well?
R:  He gets, uh, around good.  Um, he goes slow, but it doesn't keep him from wanting to go out and explore.
L:  Ah.
R:  In fact, he's the -- he's the one that tries to sneak outside all the time --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- out the front.  They have a doggie door in the back that they use.
L:  Oh.
R:  But, um, he's the one that will end up, um, um, with the -- me chasing him down the street.
L:  [LAUGH] Hm.
R:  So ...  Do you live on a farm or something, is that how -- how you have chickens?
L:  No.  I -- I live in Northridge, which is a -- a suburb ...
R:  Northridge?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I -- I used to live in San Fernando Valley.
L:  Where?
R:  Um, Studio City, the border of North Hollywood.
L:  Yeah.  That's close.
R:  Yeah.  Um, so you -- they -- you have chickens out in Northridge?
L:  Yes.  In -- in the back yard, um, I don't know if I'm zoned for 'em or not, but nobody is complaining.
R:  How long have you had 'em?
L:  I've had 'em for about two years now.  But, um, about twenty years ago I had a flock of chickens too and one by one they either died off or a hawk got 'em.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, that -- that ended my -- my chicken raising.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But then I recently retired and I thought gee, I'd love to have chickens again and so somebody gave me two hens and a rooster and twelve little babies --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and that's where I started.  Since then I've had many babies because these hens love to sit on eggs.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um ...
R:  How many chickens do you have now?
L:  Right now, uh, I've just gotten rid of four roosters.  So, now I have two roosters and five hens.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But -- but I have two -- two hens sitting.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So ...
R:  So, you let 'em on their eggs so that they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- end up --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- hatching?
L:  Yeah, I do.
R:  What do you end up doing with the -- the little baby chicks?
L:  Trying to find homes for 'em.
R:  Oh.
L:  And I was lucky because right before Easter I had -- one afternoon one Mama came walking down the driveway with ten babies --
R:  Oh, dear!
L:  -- and the next day another Mama came walking down the driveway with seven babies.  So, that was the week before Easter.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But fortunately I found a home in the country for all of them.
R:  Oh, good.
L:  So, that -- that took care of that, um, but I ended up -- with my first batch of chickens I ended up with too many roosters and I had, uh, just a hell of a time trying to find homes for these adult roosters.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  One rooster to twenty hens is a good ratio --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I had seven roosters and six hens.
R:  Ah.
L:  So, they were driving my hens crazy.
R:  Oh, I bet.
L:  But I've gotten homes for all except -- I just want to find one more home and then I'll be happy.
R:  Uh-huh.  And you're gonna -- are you gonna get -- end up getting rid of the chicks as they -- they hatch or ...?
L:  No.  I'll keep 'em and -- but as soon as I find out that I have any roosters there then I'll have to find homes for 'em.
R:  You'll find homes for the roosters?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  'Cause it's just too hard on the hens.
R:  Yeah, I can -- I can imagine.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, those roosters are just terrible.  But, anyway, it's fun.  I really like chickens.  They're -- they can be a lotta fun.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I let 'em roam in the back yard.  So, uh, they have lots of bugs to eat, plus I feed 'em --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- scraps.
