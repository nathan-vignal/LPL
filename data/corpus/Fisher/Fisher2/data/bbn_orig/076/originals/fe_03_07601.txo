R:  Mm, hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.  
L:  I'm Barb and I live in Iowa.
R:  Uh, my name is Doray, I live in uh Philadelphia.
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  Huh.
L:  Well, you have a professional spo- you have several professional sports teams there.
R:  Yeah, but I don't like none of them.
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I don't like no teams from here.  I like -- I like -- I -- where -- what's -- what's you like?
L:  Well, I uh, the professional sports, probably I prefer basketball.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, and I'm watching the Cubs game right now.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Um, so baseball if it's the Cubs.  Otherwise I don't really like to watch baseball on T.V. but --
R:  Oh, okay.  Who your favorite basketball team?
L:  Um, I suppose in the professionals, it's -- well, I guess I don't know.  I really -- I guess I prefer college basketball, but --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- um on the professional teams it -- it's been the Bulls for quite some time and then I kinda got onto the San Antonio Spurs when they were playing in the finals just now.
R:  All right.
L:  Um, how about you?
R:  Yeah.  My favorite teams has been -- well, like, my favorite teams used to be the Magic and the Nix, and then I started liking the Lakers --
L:  Oh, the Lakers?
R:  -- but it's the --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I still like the Magic, the Nix, the Lakers and the Celtics.  
L:  Okay.
R:  They're more my favorite teams.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And like none of them get good, get close, but --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
R:  That's all right, though.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I --
R:  Maybe on next year.  
L:  I follow the Lakers a lot until this year.  I don't know why.  I just kinda got away from them, I don't know.
R:  'Cause they're bummy this year.  
L:  Yes, they were.  Maybe that was why I didn't.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  They were some bums.
L:  Maybe they just -- they weren't that much fun.
R:  They wasn't. 
L:  And --
R:  Usually they be all right, but um that they fell off this year I guess because there was so many people injured on the team so --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  They --
R:  I don't really watch a lot of the sports besides basketball.
L:  Yeah.  I don't either.  Well, I guess in the fall, yeah, I do.  I have to watch football.  Um --
R:  Yeah, I watch football sometimes.  Not all the time, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- not like I would if it was basketball. 
L:  No.
R:  But I watch it sometimes.  
L:  But I think I like um -- li- like I said, I think my favorite is college basketball, but if I had to do a professional sport, ah, it depends upon who's playing, I guess.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I have a hard time just watching a game of two teams that I don't have any interest in, you know?
R:  Yes, I get you.
L:  So I don't spend a lot of time with them.
R:  Right.  I will watch ba- I will watch baseball, but baseball are like one of the things, like if you're at the game, it's probably a lot funner than it is watching it on T.V.
L:  Right.  
R:  So I can't -- like, if I just be bored.
L:  Yeah.  I guess that --
R:  And they may get bored on T.V.
L:  -- goes kinda slowly.
R:  Yes.
L:  That's right.  I -- you know, I like football I think.  Um, a little more action.  And basketball of course is very active and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- seems to go quickly.
R:  Yeah.  Pretty much.
L:  So -- but anyway.  So you don't like any of the Philadelphia teams, huh?
R:  No.  Because they suck.
L:  Okay.
R:  But, all right, no, for example, like the seventy sixes, therefore they like -- a lot of people like them uh, because a lot of people like Alan Iverson[?] but if -- if you would meet Alan Iverson, you would not like him.
L:  Mm.
R:  Because he -- yeah, he is very ignorant.  He's a very ignorant person.
L:  Oh.  
R:  So but and I just don't -- like you, like everybody say he carried the seventy sixes on his shoulder, but Alan Iverson, he could play basketball good but he needed the -- he needed to have a better attitude about the game.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's why his coach don't want him there and that's why he quit the team.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, he is uh kind of a um -- well, I don't know.  I used to watch the -- when Denis Rodman played with the Bulls, he was um -- I kind of liked Denis Rodman actually, but --
R:  Guess I -- was a weirdo.  He was crazy.
L:  But he -- he is very strange, but I just kind of -- I don't know, he was just intriguing to me.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I think Alan Iverson is somewhat like him maybe.  Um, attitude wise maybe.  I don't know.
R:  Yeah.  Attitude wise, they both --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So and I don't -- I don't -- haven't really paid attention to what the Phillies are doing this year in baseball.
R:  Huh?
L:  I ha- said I haven't really paid attention to see what the Phillies are doing in baseball.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I -- I don't know about that at all.
L:  Yeah.  So -- and what else --
R:  But --
L:  -- do you have?  Do you have a foot- Philadelphia Eagles, yeah, you've got a football team.  
R:  The Eagles.  Yeah, they're all right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're nice.  I like them.  They ain't going right.  That's probably the best team that I like that's in Philadelphia.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is the Eagles.  I don't like none of uh no other teams.  
L:  I think it's hard to um go to many games if you're nearby because they're so expensive.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  Just from what I have heard, so --
R:  Yeah, they are.  Like, when you be like -- like basketball games, depending on where you sit at, they be like a hundred and -- a hundred dollars a ticket.
L:  Right.
R:  And then especially going to play offs, they be expensive.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I can't go to them.  I only went to one game before and that was the Magic versus the Sixes.
L:  Oh.
R:  And my favorite play- person on the Magic didn't even play that game.  He was injured.
L:  Oh.
R:  He injured his hand.
L:  Oh.  
R:  So I was kinda mad.
L:  Yeah.  Well, at least you got to go to one.  I've never been to a professional --
R:  Yeah, at least I did.
L:  I've been to baseball games, but uh not uh -- not football or basketball I guess.  
R:  Huh?
L:  I said I've not been to a professional basketball or football.  I have been to Cubs games.
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  But anyway, they're kinda fun.  So how did you he- get into this Fisher phone survey thing?
R:  Oh, from um some -- all right, I was going to Jobcorp[?] you know what that is?
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  Yeah.  I was going to Jobcorp and my teacher, his name -- well, his name's Brett, Mister Collan[?] right, he was uh -- he was like, "You know how you can earn a little extra money?"  I was like, "How?"  He was, like, "Well, they got this survey thing they doing".  He goes, "I think they'll call you up to three times" and stuff and I was like, "What?" and he was like, "All you got to do is talk to people for ten minutes".  I was like, "I might as well do it.  I ain't got nothing else to do".
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  Might as well as.
L:  Right.  I know, I --
R:  Yeah, he always coming up with ideas of trying to get money 'cause he -- 'cause that's what Jobcorp for, basically for a lot of people who don't have money and they need jobs and stuff like that.
L:  Right.  Well, that's a good idea.
R:  But I don't talk to him no more.  I need to call him.  
L:  Huh.
R:  'Cause I don't go there no more.  I -- I finished everything, so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yep, so I haven't --
L:  So do you have a job then?
R:  Huh?
L:  Do you have a job?
R:  No, I need to find a job.
L:  Oh, you gotta find something, yeah.
R:  Yes.
L:  I um -- I've gotten several of these calls but I have no gotten any money from them yet, but --
R:  How many calls you had so far?
L:  Um, probably this is my -- my fourth.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I just kinda started.
R:  Well, I think when they done -- they um -- well, they told me there -- he told me it was only up to three calls and then after that, they said it'll take about, well, six months.  He says he knows somebody who -- they waited for about six months till they got their check.
L:  Oh, my gosh. 
R:  Yeah, that's a long wait, right?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
R:  It's crazy.  
L:  Oh, well.  It's kinda --
R:  Oh, well --
L:  -- fun.  I like to talk on the phone and you know, so that's why I decided to do it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So it was --
R:  How was -- where you say you from?  Iowa?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  How is it out there?
L:  It's uh well it's very warm and um it -- it's a -- a nice place.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  It's very um -- I mean, I live in a city so I mean, I'm not out in the country, in the middle of a cornfield like you might imagine Iowa to be.
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  But uh I live in a -- in a, you know, a city not nearly as big as, like, Philadelphia, but probably about the size of maybe [inaudible] or Harrisburg or um -- in your State, and um it's a -- you know, it's a nice place to live.  Kind of more slow paced maybe than a big city.
R:  Huh?
L:  Maybe slower paced than a big city.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  You know, but um very pleasant, so we've lived here quite a while.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I get you.  That's good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Out there, like, what is -- what is real big out there?  You know how like some places, like something is real popular and stuff? 
L:  Um, well farming is probably the main industry of the State because um in the -- from the -- in the central part of the State, that's probably it.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Um, here we have manufacturing.  We have John Deere headquarters here and um Alcoa headquarters are here.  So we have some major manufacturing going on.  
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Um and then we're right on the Mississippi River.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Which runs down north and south of the country.
R:  Do you -- are you having, like -- it be like a lot of thunderstorms and stuff down there?
L:  Um, I -- yeah, in the summertime when we get, you know, the humidity goes up and the temperatures go up, then we do.  
R:  It'd be like tornados and stuff?
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Um --
R:  You don't be scared of that kinda stuff?
L:  Um, you know, I -- I guess I respect it when they have a tornado warning on or something, I pay attention to it, but I don't get all panicky about it and --
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  You know?  But --
R:  'Cause when they be saying, like down there, they be showing it on T.V. how it be, like, they all -- everything be damaged everywhere.
L:  Oh.  
R:  Lot of houses --
L:  [COUGH].
R:  -- be all knocked down and --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It -- that happens.  We -- fortunately in this area we've been pretty lucky, that the tornados seem to skip around us but um they -- there have been some major ones in the State, so you know, I guess every part of the country has their own weather.  You've got major storms out there too, don't you?  I mean, you have thunderstorms and --
R:  Yeah, we have thunderstorms, but our thunderstorms last for about twenty minutes.
L:  Oh.
R:  And that's -- that's it.  Like --
L:  Not too bad.
R:  We don't have wind, never had no like real huge thunderstorms.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  The huh -- the longest one probably lasted is about probably not even a hour yet.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But it'd be like that's if we have, like, a hurricane come through here.  
L:  Oh.  
R:  But that's it.
L:  Oh.  What's your weather like right now?
R:  Oh, it's just warm outside.  It's kinda chilly too.
L:  Oh.
R:  Not like -- it's -- during the day is warm but it's like we got a ninety degrees.
L:  Yeah.  So it's not as warm as it might be this time of the year, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I've heard you had kinda -- Washington D.C. anyway has been pretty cool, so --
R:  Yeah, it's not as hot as it usually would be.
L:  [COUGH].  Yeah.
R:  And well, I don't know what's going on today.  
L:  Huh.  Well, but it'll get warm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, we got summer --
