L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  My name's Tammy.
R:  My name is Kim.
L:  Hi, Kim.  Oh, I guess we're gonna talk about pets tonight.
R:  Okay.  I have two cats.
L:  Okay.  I have a cat and a dog and right now I'm dog sitting and cat sitting for an in law.
R:  Oh, good.
L:  Totally love 'em.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They might not get 'em back.  [LAUGH]  And, uh, let's see.  [LIPSMACK]  Um, I love my animals.  I wish I had more.  My husband says no 'cause we like to travel and it's too hard anymore to find someone to take care of 'em while we're gone.  Let's see.  What else would you like to know?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, do you like to play with 'em?
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  [MN]
L:  Our dog's fourteen right now.  So, he's outta the playing stage, um, and sometimes he gets in the mood, but not like he used to when he was a pup --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the cat he's funny.  Yeah.  He's -- you know how cats are.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  They have their -- they have their moods.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So, it's like I'll -- I'll let you know when I'm ready to play.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  But, um, yeah, I -- we would both like to get, um [LIPSMACK], another dog down the road, a bigger one, 'cause right now we just have a Pomeranian.  But I would like a bigger dog that you can, you know, play fetch with and take to the river and all that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...  But, like I said, we like to travel and -- and it's hard trying to find baby sitters and I can't kennel 'em 'cause that breaks my heart.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know.  I have two of my own.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  I -- I have Sammy and they don't like anybody else in the house and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they hide.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's how our cat is, um, and we had this one cat that was just as friendly as anything and the other one the total opposite.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, but -- and we live in the country.  So, we let ours come and go as they please too.
R:  Well, that's good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm -- I'm in an apartment and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they don't go out.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Well, my one -- my -- the only cat I have left now he's pretty lazy.  So, he doesn't travel too far from home, but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- which is okay.  He's a good mouser.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] I wish my cat ...  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I got one big one.  He weighs twenty five pounds.
L:  Get out!
R:  Twenty five pound he weighs.
L:  Oh, gosh!  No, this one only weighs probably twelve to fourteen.
R:  Mm, and Sammy, Sammy weighs twelve pounds.
L:  Oh, God, love him.
R:  And he's black and white --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and the other one's pure black.
L:  Yeah, mine's pure gray.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Um [LIPSMACK], I had a long haired, um, yellow cat that I loved to death --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- and he was our first cat after we got married and he just meant the world to us and he got hit by a car about four years ago.
R:  Oh.
L:  I still cry.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  He -- he meant the world to us.
R:  Yeah.  When I was a little girl my Mom --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- had a -- a pure black cat and we named it Whisky --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- and, um, he got hit by a car and it was underneath the car and I crawled underneath it and I had to take it to the pet -- vet's and they had to put it down 'cause --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it was bleeding from the inside.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, I had a dog like that that got hit by a car.  Argh.
R:  Oh.
L:  It just broke my heart.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, there was nothing they could do for it though.
R:  No.  No.  'Cause I asked --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- the vet if I could do anything and he says no, because he's bleeding and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he said -- see the blood coming and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so he might as well put him to sleep.
L:  That's gotta be hard.
R:  So, and I said, "All right.  I guess I have to".  [LAUGH]
L:  Huh.  Yeah.  Well, we -- we had a Beagle that just passed away like two years ago --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- and, um, it got to the point where she really had trouble walking and breathing and, you know, the vet gave us the option, "Do you want me to put her down?" and I -- I just couldn't take her life.  I just couldn't and I said, you know, "Let -- let the Lord just take her" --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, and like three days later she died.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But she went peacefully and we did what we could for her.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But that's hard.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, it is.
L:  It's real hard.
R:  Very hard.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yep.
L:  That's another reason I don't -- I'm kinda putting off getting another one.
R:  Yeah.  And my Mom she had a German Shepherd for the longest time --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and she had to put her down.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yep.
L:  What was her name?
R:  Cody.
L:  Ah, I love it.
R:  Yep.  Cody.
L:  I wanna a Shepherd.
R:  Oh, she was beautiful.
L:  I really do.
R:  She didn't like men too much.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Well, some of 'em are like that.  Some of 'em would rather have a female than, um, men around, you know?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  It was only my Mom and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and me and there was no men and so she didn't like men and if there was a cop coming over to check the trailer park and she'd just start growling and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so if the cop says, "You better do something" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I'd say, "For what?  She's protecting me".
L:  Yeah, that's what I want a big dog for 'cause if I'm here alone, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the weekends or at night, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I just feel I want something that could, you know, put a little bit of scare into someone, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I -- I was looking at a Shepherd, but the ones I found at the pet store are five hundred dollars and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I mean, I'd rather pay my bills than [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] I know. 
L:  -- spend it on a dog and then ...  I've got bills and everything else, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, yeah, a Shepherd's really what I would like.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Even if it's a Shepherd mix.
R:  Oh, yeah.  And she had long hair.
L:  Ah.
R:  Yep.  All gray -- gray and tan-ish.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yep.
L:  Now, she put her down?
R:  She had to, yeah.
L:  How old was she?
R:  Uh, she was fifteen years old.
L:  Oh, my gosh!  Well, that's pretty old for a dog.
R:  Yeah.  Fifteen and she couldn't lift her neck anymore.
L:  Oh, God!
R:  My Mom -- she was trying to eat and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- she couldn't lift it up.  So, the vet said he might as well put her down.
L:  That's heartbreaking.
R:  And my grandmother she's got two dogs and she always had dogs.  She's got the Basset Hounds.
L:  I've had a dog since I was a baby.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, for thirty eight years I've never been without an animal --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you know, and, uh, I keep telling my husband, "I can't -- you know, how can I go without an animal?  I've always had one since I was a baby".
R:  Yeah.  I know.  Yeah.  It's like --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- with our family we had cats and dogs and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we had birds and we had fishes --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and we had hamsters and my ten year old daughter +brought home yesterday a turtle.
L:  Oh, jeeze!  [LAUGH]
R:  "Can we keep it?"
L:  Never had a pet turtle.  Never had a pet turtle.
R:  Yeah.  "Can we keep it?"  No.  Get it ...
L:  [LAUGH] They don't eat much I'm sure --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and they don't go too far.
R:  This was a snapping one.
L:  Was it a snapping ...?
R:  Yeah, it was a snapping one.
L:  Ow!  I once ...
R:  Yeah.  But she was at her --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- friend's house -- they live in the country and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I -- I looked at, um, the belly and I said, "Uh-huh.  It's a snapping one".
L:  Oh.  No, I'm not into those.
R:  No.
L:  Just my dogs and my cats.  I'd -- I'd like to have horses, but they're a lotta work --
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  -- and we would -- and we'd need to have, uh, someone take care of 'em and it's just too much anymore.
R:  I know.  I love horses.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're so pretty.
L:  Yeah.  Well, my girlfriend has horses at her farm.  So, if I wanna ride I can just go there and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [LAUGH] you know, she has the expense and not me.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, okay, give it back.
L:  Exactly.  I'll live with my dog and my cat.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They're good companions and they sleep with us too.
R:  Yep.
L:  Spoilt.
R:  My cat does too.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yep.
L:  They go for car rides and they know what the keys mean when you wave 'em and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know?
R:  Yeah.  My cat I have my -- I have my three kids asleep and I have a -- a three month old baby --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so I have a full sized bed and try to sleep with a ten, an eight and a six and then me and plus two cats on the bed --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and I -- and guess who gets kicked outta the bed?  Me.
L:  I know.
R:  So, I end up sleeping on the -- [LAUGH] I sleep on the couch.
L:  There were times when we had four dogs in bed with us.  Yeah.
R:  [MN]  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  We'd just like look at each other and laugh, like are we nuts or what?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I don't know.  God gave us a love for animals and I don't know.  I'm glad there's people like us in the world because --
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  -- there are some people that just don't care.
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  It breaks our heart.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  Yeah.  And ...
R:  I know.  I see these people leave these dogs outside --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- all year round --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- with no food, no water --
L:  I know.
R:  -- and I said to someone, "Hey, you know what?  Let me tie you out there all day and all night with no shelter --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- no food and water and let you freeze your butt off", you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  "Well, that's why they go fur".  "Yeah.  So?"
L:  That fur doesn't mean anything --
R:  I know.
L:  -- when it's thirty below, you know, and no food in your belly, you know?
R:  [MN]
L:  [LIPSMACK] Come on!  You wanna be fed every so many hours too.
R:  Yep.  Yep.  So, I usually go -- me and my kids always run out and put water and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- put scraps together and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- we dumped it and it would eat and ...
L:  That's sweet.
R:  So, we finally called the police and the police took the dog.
L:  Did they?
R:  Yeah, because it was getting -- it was like really, really getting too cold and I said, "I can't take this no more".
L:  Well, that's abuse, you know?
R:  Yep.
L:  People like that definitely should not have animals.
R:  Oh, believe me!
L:  I believe in fining them good.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Even throwing them in a jail for a while because those animals don't have a choice and ...
R:  Well, I know.  They can't talk.
L:  Oh, and I believe in spaying like you won't believe.  Spay and neuter.
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  It's so important.  [MN]
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  I just -- I get sick of these people that are always raising puppies for money and then --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- if they don't get sold then they get put down.  It's like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's sickening.
R:  Yep.
L:  You know?
R:  And I have -- I go -- I go to the [inaudible] County Club down here and we go and this girl she's really sick in her mind --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and she has these animals.  Well, she's not allowed to have any animals because --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- she abused them --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and [MN] this -- she had a puppy dog and she did something to disgusting to it and we called the police and then the police found out --
