L:  We're in Louisiana.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, cool.  Where?
L:  Uh, down by Fort Polk.
R:  Huh.  All right. Neat.  Um, well, do you have a favorite professional sport?
L:  No, I don't.  [LAUGH] I hate sports.  I --
R:  Um --
L:  -- I do like basketball pretty good.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I mean, I don't ever sit and watch a basketball game but --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- I like the Lakers pretty good.  And I like, you know, one on --
R:  Oh, the Lakers.
L:  Huh?
R:  Oh, boo.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Um --
L:  And, you know, when they're playing in the finals then I'll watch 'em but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- argh, other than that ...
R:  Yeah.  Hm.  All right
L:  Dull.
R:  Well, ah --
L:  So, you tell me.  I'm sure you have lots.
R:  I spend -- I spend far too much of my time watching sports now [several inaudible words] Um, my room mates make fun of me 'cause they'll come in my room and they'll say my TVs never on anything besides ESPN or the Simpsons.  Um --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- but, um, my favorite professional sport would have to be football.  Um --
L:  Oh, of course.  What team?
R:  Um, I -- I don't see that, when it comes to professional football, I don't have a team.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I just watch it all.  Um, my true passion is, give me college basketball.
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, I -- I, um, go to the University of North Carolina right now.
L:  Oh, really.
R:  And, ah, um, yeah, I -- pretty -- maybe almost unhealthily obsessed with it.  [LAUGH] But, um --
L:  I don't know, my husband's pretty bad with football.
R:  Yeah.  Um, [LIPSMACK] but, yeah, I'll -- I'll -- will watch pretty much any sport if it's on TV.
L:  Oh,
R:  Baseball gets me 'cause it's a little slow for me.  But other than baseball, I'll watch anything that's on.
L:  I can watch it there in person.  Now I just -- I abhor football.  Oh, I just hate it.
R:  You [inaudible] oh, wow!  I --
L:  I mean, it really puts me to sleep.
R:  Really?
L:  Yes.  I cannot stand it.
R:  Oh, boy.
L:  My husband is a Dallas Cowboys fanatic.
R:  Really?
L:  He's from Dallas.
R:  Ah.
L:  So, now, I can watch golf.  I -- I enjoy golf pretty good.
R:  Golf?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Golf doesn't put you to sleep and football does?
L:  Right. Isn't that funny?
R:  That --
L:  I understand those sports; basketball and golf, I understand that.
R:  Uh-huh.  Well --
L:  I don't understand football.
R:  -- well, that's one of the things I love about football actually is that just when you think well, there's, like, a certain level of understanding, where you understand the basic positions and rules and stuff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But then, after that I -- you can't even begin to understand the plays.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Um, and it's, uh, there's a, um, I just [LAUGH] about a -- 'bout six months ago -- well, I guess it was, like, the be- -- the middle of last football season I discovered this show on TV that they'll -- they'll take one play of football and break it down and put, like, show you everything that happens throughout five minutes.
L:  What --
R:  It's absolutely fascinating.
L:  What is -- what show is that?
R:  It's called, um, Edge NFL Matchup.  It comes on at, like, eight thirty in the morning on ESPN on Sundays.
L:  I'm going to tell my husband.  He would love that.
R:  Yeah.  It -- or go online and look it up 'cause it -- it -- it's, yeah, Edge NFL Matchup.  And it's -- it's just absolutely fascinating; I can't get enough of it.  Um --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I'm sure you probably wouldn't like it but --
L:  No.
R:  Um, yeah, it's act- -- my -- I have one other room mate and I have been complaining recently about how, uh, now that the -- the hockey final's just ended and, uh --
L:  I love hockey.
R:  -- and -- and the bas- -- you love hockey?
L:  Yeah, but not on TV.
R:  Oh, well, see hockey's good --
L:  We used have a little local team here --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh, my gosh!  I love to go to those games.  Now I had no clue what was going on --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but I, man, for out tenth anniversary that's what we did.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We went to the hockey game.  But I'm --
R:  Did you get ever get pretty into it?
L:  Yeah.  But this -- it sucks because the -- the owner of the team stole all the money and they folded.
R:  Oh, really!
L:  And that was, like, the only time I really was getting into sports and [PAUSE] really liking that.
R:  Huh.
L:  Oh, but, oh, I do like hockey now.  I don't have a clue what goes on.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I like 'em when they fight and that's basically, you know.  [LAUGH]
R:  Like -- like that old quote I went to a fight and a hockey game broke out.
L:  Yeah.  And I li- -- I like boxing now.  But, I mean, as far as watching 'em in TV, I don't like to do that.
R:  Hm.
L:  My dream is to go to, like, Reno and see a boxing match or something.
R:  Huh.
L:  I don't even care who it is, just -- I just love to see people pound each other.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I know and that -- that's crazy I know.
R:  No, I mean, there's some part of that in everybody.
L:  Yeah, really.  I think so. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  The violence.
R:  Yeah.  Well, then but you don't like football.
L:  But I just don't, I really don't.
R:  But they pound each other every play.
L:  I know.  It -- it really is to me it's so boring.
R:  Huh.
L:  My husband puts it on; I just go right to sleep.  Every --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- Sunday -- every Sunday afternoon, I'm out.
R:  So, is he a big, uh, is he [several inaudible words] or does he like college too?
L:  In a -- well, he'll watch anything that's football.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But he prefers, you know, NFL, Dallas and it -- it agers- aggravates him to no end because where we live is New Orleans Saints.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, he can't get the games.
L:  And they'll put on a Saints game before the -- the Dallas game.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that makes him so mad.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Um, a bunch of my friends and I have taken to going to a bar on Saturday -- on Sundays and -- around one o'clock, and they got -- the bar gets the super satellite package so they have five different games showing at once.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But that's how we spend most of our Sunday afternoons now --
L:  Oh.  Really.
R:  -- um, during football season.  
L:  I just sleep.  [LAUGH]
R:  Or I have [LAUGH] I have -- I, like, I'm a waste on Sundays just -- so, Saturdays and Sundays during football 'cause I'll sit down and watch college -- I -- I'll go to our game if it -- if we have a home game at, um, on Saturday, and then I'll come home and watch the other games.  And then I will [LAUGH] s- -- wake up Sunday, go to church, get home from church and go right back to watching football all day.
L:  See, I -- I just go right to sleep.  But I just -- see I'm a college student also but improbably quite a bit older than you.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But I -- I just transferred to McNeese State --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and they went -- I think it was this year -- this past season; they went almost all the way to the championship.  
R:  Yeah.  Is that division two?  Or ...
L:  And -- I don't know.
R:  You don't know.  Okay.
L:  Um --
R:  Huh, in football that is?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Huh.
L:  And they [NOISE] I think they were one game away, McNeese was, from winning and they lost -- who did McNeese lose to?  Won to Carolina  [NOISE] who?  [NOISE] [inaudible] Anyway Kentucky -- they lost to Kentucky.
R:  Huh.
L:  And I did watch a couple of games then because it was so exciting to see, you know, the local people really do good 'cause they never went that far before.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And the last game I didn't watch it 'cause I was so afraid they was going to lose --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I can't take that.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, um --
L:  And that's the only time I've really sat down and watched a football game.
R:  Huh.  There was a real big deal here in North Carolina, um, about a ye- -- I guess it was a year ago right now when, uh, the Hurricanes, the hockey teams went all the way to the final --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And, oh, all of a sudden it just -- every -- it took to life here.  Everyone was, you know, you wouldn't think that maybe hockey would catch on in North Carolina when they [several inaudible words] it was only about five years ago that it even it got here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, but oh, man, you should -- you should see these -- I mean [inaudible] every -- every other car had a b- -- had a Carolina Hurricanes flag.  You know those, like, window flags that people put on?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Every other car had one of those on it.  It was -- it was a sight to see around here.
L:  Hockey to me is really fun to go to.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  To go to the game.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, I agree.
L:  But and -- and -- and I love -- I was almost in tears when they decided to pull out because I really did, you know, I really liked doing that.  And -- and my kids did too.  And I have girls; I have three girls --
R:  And they like hockey?
L:  -- and they even liked it, you know.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  And that guy never went to jail for that.
R:  He never went to jail?
L:  Never went to jail.
R:  How did he get away with it?
L:  I just don't even know.   But I d- -- I don't know.  It's been a while since it happened, probably about four years.  I por- -- I don't even remember.  He might have went to jail and we just never heard about it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But you would think you would hear something about that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, oh, but that would be exciting.
R:  Yeah.  It -- it's-- it's fun.
L:  So, do you have a big team, like, your college where you go --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you got a pretty good team?
R:  Um, our football team is okay.  Um, they're always -- they always finish in the middle of our +competition.  Um, our basketball team was, uh, one of, uh, have the second winningest[?] program in basketball -- in college basketball history.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  Um, we've -- we've been incredible until the last two years.  My -- hm -- my sophomore junior year, we get -- we've been -- we went through the worst two seasons in school history.
L:  Oh.
R:  And so, we just, uh, fired our coach this year and, um, we got a really good coach coming in so, hopefully --
L:  Oh, good.
R:  -- we're going to turn things around.  Ours is a --
L:  Are -- do you play?  Or ...
R:  Um, no, I'm not on -- not on the team.
L:  Not on the team.
R:  Um, I tr- -- I play every chance I can get in pick up teams and stuff but ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  [MN]
R:  Go ahead.
L:  I -- I was going to say, I think our basketball team, our girls -- the girls basketball team went real far.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But the boys didn't and -- but I think their baseball program is what their claim to fame is.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But I don't know.  Like I -- I don't ever keep up with that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Maybe when I actually start attending 'cause I haven't been attending there, I was attending another school and I just transferred.
R:  Uh, where did you transfer from?
L:  From -- have you heard of North Western?
R:  Ah, in Chicago?  Or in --
L:  Oh, no.  Here in -- in Louisiana.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  It's in Nackerbish[?].
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Well, um, their football team went pretty far and they were up against McNeese, but McNeese beat 'em out for the, you know, in the final somewhere.
R:  Oh.
L:  And maybe when I --
