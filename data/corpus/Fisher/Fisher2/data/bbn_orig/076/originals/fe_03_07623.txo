L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.  My name is Laura.
L:  I'm Margo.
R:  Oh, hi, Margo.  Um, I --
L:  You -- you --
R:  -- have a dog.  
L:  I have a dog -- I have two dogs.
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  [LAUGH].
R: [LAUGH].
L:  One inside dog, one outside dog.
R:  Okay.  Okay.  Mine is um an outside.  She mostly spends her time on the deck and there's a lake out back and ducks and stuff, so she has a lot to keep her occupied.  Hm.  And then I go out there and, you know, sit during the day, on nice days.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And we have really nice weather here, so -- and then I take her out, you know um, so that she can use the bathroom several times a day.
L:  Uh-huh.  What kind of a dog is it?
R:  She's um Rottweiler mixed with Shepherd.  She's black and brown.  She's --
L:  Kind of a --
R:  -- really pretty.
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  So is that -- so she's not real big?  Just kinda medium sized?
R:  Ah, yeah.  I think she's --
L:  Is she --
R:  -- gonna uh get bigger, though.  I thought she was through growing but um she seems to be putting on -- she's getting taller, so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- she'll be four in August and I think she's probably gonna grow a little bit more.
L:  Really?
R:  I hope not much more 'cause then I won't be able to handle her very well.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  'Cause she seems big enough as it is.
R:  Yeah, she is.
L:  Mhm.
R:  She's uh at least fifty five pounds.
L:  Oh, that is big.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  I wouldn't think that big, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  We have -- we have our outside dog is a brown Lab --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And my husband's training her to be a hunting dog.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  To hunt ducks.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Whatever, and she is his dog.  We --
R:  Mm.
L:  She's still kind of a pup and we let him do whatever with her, but --
R:  Okay.
L:  And he's the master.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  She doesn't listen to anybody else.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  She's really been a challenge.  I mean, she's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- good and -- and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I just don't have a whole lot to do with her, 'cause she's the outside dog, and then --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we have a poodle.
R:  Mm.
L:  Just a little, teeny, tiny poodle.
R:  I know, she's cute.  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  And uh a little red one and uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we -- it's kinda funny, and I think it's because he's so little, that he um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he's kinda shy and he's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he's a bit nervous --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in a way.  He's a little bit paranoid about -- like and I think it's 'cause he's so small, he's kinda stressed about keeping, you know, himself safe.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But -- and then I have three kids and so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  But they -- but the poodle is not a kids' dog.  I mean, he's --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- he's an adult dog.  He sleeps in my bed.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  With me.
R:  In the bed?  Really?  [LAUGH].
L:  In the bed.  I know.  Isn't that --
R:  What does your husband say?
L:  That's where I think he got -- he doesn't have a problem with it.  No, it's --
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, that's really good.
L:  Yeah.  Well --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I grew up with parents that let the poodle sleep at the bottom of their bed and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in their bed with them and so I didn't ever think nothing of it and then --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when I got married, they said, well, we need to get us a dog and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and for some reason, and -- and he doesn't -- he's pretty good about it.  He doesn't ever complain.  He's kind --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of a softie that way, so --
R:  Mhm.  That's good.
L:  In fact, I think if -- if I let the big dog come in the house, I think it would probably sleep in bed [LAUGH] too.
R:  [LAUGH].  My goodness.
L:  I would have a fit about that, but --
R:  Yeah, you wouldn't have any room then.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, and well -- and I just read something the other day about people that let their pets sleep with them --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- don't get as good a rest as the ones that don't.
R:  Hm.
L:  And it's true because they wiggle around and --
R:  Mhm.  They wake you up --
L:  -- they move and stuff.
R:  -- yeah.
L:  Like, yeah.  I'm thinking I'm --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- crazy for letting it happen.
R:  [LAUGH].  We've let our dogs sleep in uh in our room, you know, like when it's -- very seldom do we get snow, but every now and again --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- we will.  Uh, this is Atlanta, Georgia.
L:  I was going to say --
R:  In the south.
L:  -- what part of the country you're in.  Yeah, huh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But um we -- you know, we let her sleep in our bedroom, at the foot of our bed, but my --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- husband would have a fit if she got in our bed.
L:  In the bed [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.  
L:  I -- it's totally reasonable.  I can kinda see why he would [LAUGH] yeah.
R:  Mm.  Yeah. 
L:  But --
R:  But my daughter, she has a dog and she lets her dog sleep with her, so --
L:  Yeah.  It's not -- I guess it's just -- I -- a common thing, I guess.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know, but --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Um, have you ever lost your dog?
R:  Um, she's gotten away from us and we've had to chase her, but she --
L:  Mhm.
R:  She'll always come back.
L:  Oh, right.
R:  But no, we've never, mhm, because we --
L:  Lost her?
R:  -- you know --
L:  Is uh do you live -- when you say Atlanta, do you live, like --
R:  I live in the suburbs.
L:  -- right there and kinda --
R:  In um -- yeah.
L:  Kind of --
R:  Like, twenty minutes from downtown and the airport is like twenty minutes.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, so I live in uh a suburb of Atlanta.
L:  Well, we live in a -- we live in a small town.  It's about three thousand people and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- yeah, the reason I asked is 'cause just last Saturday I was out doing some errands and stuff and -- and the dog had gone with me.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I got out at one place, just stepped out for just a second and got back in and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he jumped out, jumped out of the car.
R:  Oh, no.
L:  This is the poodle.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And um I didn't realize he was gone.
R:  Mm.
L:  'Cause sometimes he rides underneath the seat and --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- got back inside, didn't think nothing of it --
R:  You didn't leave --
L:  -- and I got home --
R:  -- without him?
L:  Not on purpose.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  But I did.
R:  I know, I know.  Not on purpose.
L:  I left without him [LAUGH].
R:  But -- yeah, 'cause you thought he was probably under the seat, okay?
L:  I did, yeah.  I didn't even think.
R:  Oh, no.
L:  And then I got home, didn't even think nothing of it.
R:  Oh, my.
L:  I mean, it was a long time before I realized he was gone.
R:  Oh.
L:  I mean, it was --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- about four hours and I'm going --
R:  I bet that was so scary.
L:  -- I've lost the dog.
R:  Oh, no.
L:  And so we went out and started looking about.  And I figured -- I ki- kinda figured out where we were when I'd -- when I left him and stuff --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and so --
R:  So you went back there?
L:  -- we went up and down the street -- what's that?
R:  You went back where you left him at?
L:  Yes.  And --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- kinda started there and going up and down the streets and stuff --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and didn't find him and I called the --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- sheriff and said, "We've lost our dog" and they said, "Well, if we hear about one, we'll --" 
R:  Mhm.
L:  He says, "I'll let you know".
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so -- but the next morning --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- some people that knew us that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- kinda were in that same neighborhood said, "We think so and so has your dog" and these people had him.  I mean, I think --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- it was kind of --
R:  That was so ironic.
L:  Just a surprise.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That we'd get him back.
R:  And so great that you did 'cause I know -- I bet you didn't sleep at all that night?
L:  Well, you kind of wonder if they're gonna be okay.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  But and then you just think -- you console yourself and say, "Well, you know, I'm sure that somebody has picked him up and it's -- they're -- I'm sure they'll -- it'll be a nice home".  He's just so little, it was kind of amazing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that anybody even saw him.  He's just --
R:  Mm.
L:  You know, but I guess he was on the -- on the -- on the edge of the road there kinda --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- probably waiting for us to come back and get him.
R:  Oh.  
L:  And so people --
R:  Poor thing.  [LAUGH].
L:  And it was kinda of -- even though I live in a small town, I think it was still --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- kind of surprising that we --
R:  That you were able to --
L:  -- found him again.
R:  -- get him back.  I know.  So quickly.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, and -- and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just the next morning.
R:  Mm.
L:  But I felt kinda bad I hadn't noticed he was --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- missing sooner.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But we just -- I just kinda got home and got busy with the kids and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- doing our thing and it -- you know --
R:  And sometimes --
L:  -- that stuff?
R:  -- when you take him with you, you just leave him in the car for a while?
L:  Mhm.  
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  You -- you --
L:  Yeah, and --
R:  -- thought that he was underneath the seat, you would get him eventually?
L:  Right.  Or he jumps in the back with the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- kids and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I'm thinking -- well, I pretty -- I -- but I knew that I hadn't brought him ho- like, you know, I couldn't remember him getting out of the car and stuff and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- then -- then it's when it really kind of dawned on me --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, I've left him somewhere.  That makes you feel kinda guilty 'cause --
R:  I'll bet.
L:  -- they're your responsibility.
R:  Yeah.  Right.
L:  I mean, these dogs are -- you know, you're supposed to taking care of 'em and --
R:  Mhm.  Well, our --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- dog is so big --
L:  So you -- 
R:  -- that would never, ever happen and --
L:  You'd notice right away.  
R:  [LAUGH]. 
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Instantly.
L:  That's the thing.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Right.  When -- and when they're bigger like that, you would a --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I would have noticed him not being there --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but oh, no.
R:  Right.
L:  I -- I had to uh --
R:  So little.  Mhm.
L:  And my husband's going, "You should feel really bad".  Oh, he was throwing the guilt on me.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I tell ya.
R:  They have a way of --
L:  Especially after -- 
R:  -- about doing that, you know?  Mhm.
L:  Especially after.  You know?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Then he -- he kinda felt bad before for me, but --
R:  Mhm.  
L:  -- but kind of afterwards --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- he was saying, "I can't believe you -- you lost the dog like that", and yeah, he loved it.  
R:  And you didn't -- you didn't even know it for, you know, like a long time [LAUGH].
L:  I know.  I said, "But you didn't notice either". 
R:  [LAUGH].  That's all right.
L:  They should just kind of -- but he's not -- he's the kind of dog, he kind of -- you know, goes and does his own little thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  He kinda hides under the bed and stuff --
R:  Very quiet and stuff.
L:  He is.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Pretty much -- well, unless somebody comes to the house, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he doesn't make a big fuss over --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a thing.  And he's not -- did I tell you, he's not a kids' dog.  He's really an adult dog.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So the -- it wasn't like the kids were looking for him to play.
R:  Mhm.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  
L:  So --
R:  'Cause they don't really play with him that much, I guess.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  No.  No, it -- he doesn't play very good because --
R:  Right.
L:  -- he's afraid of getting hurt.
R:  Right.  He doesn't really --
L:  So he --
R:  Mhm.
L:  He's a lap dog.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Pretty much.
R:  Yeah, they -- they -- they're probably kind of rough with him.
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  We had a um -- a no dog.  It was a small dog, a house dog, a Chihuahua. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And he was --
L:  That's what our dog looks like when he has his hair all shaved off.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Just like a Chihuahua.  Mhm.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  My daughter loved that dog.  That was her dog and uh -- but he was a kids -- he -- he liked kids.  He really did.
L:  Mm.  Uh-huh.
R:  And he was so funny.  We would um go to the store and if we wouldn't take him, he would run and -- and -- we lived um in --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- Alabama then, and we lived --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- on this hill.  He would run and catch the car and jump in.  It would be so funny.
L:  That is funny.
R:  All the neighbors would be laughing.  We -- we could not get away from him [LAUGH].
L:  He was going with.
R:  Yeah.  He was so cute.
L:  And -- and the -- isn't it funny how -- how when you had a dog for a little while, they are a person.  They're part of the family.
R:  Yeah.  They're part of the family.
L:  I mean, they can -- I mean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't think Opie -- I don't think he realizes that he is just a dog.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, he -- it's like, "Well, it's his bed and he lets me sleep in it", you know?
R:  [LAUGH].  I know.  
L:  And --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- they're just so kind of -- he -- and he gets so excited.  Like, on certain days we have these routines and he kinda knows what's gonna happen and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he knows on Sunday afternoon, we're going to grandma's to eat dinner and --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- he just goes crazy.  He just knows --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- he just -- he knows he's going over to grandma's to eat dinner and it's so funny 'cause he acts --
R:  That is really -- yeah. 
L:  And other times, you know --
R:  It's -- it's amazing how dogs --
L:  -- he doesn't want to go.
R:  -- can, you know, imagine that.
L:  Pick -- yeah.  
R:  'Cause that's how it is --
L:  Pick up on that.
R:  My daughter says when she's coming over to my house, she says it's like her dog knows and she'll just start wagging her tail and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, like barking when she gets closer to the subdivision and she really, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- she just knows that they're coming to see me.
L:  Knows -- knows the area.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  Yep, and that's what'll happen, like, when we pull in -- when we get close to the yard, my dogs, they just start going -- they start getting silly and barking --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and whining.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, it's funny how they can -- they know that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I guess we probably don't give them enough credit for being as smart as they are, but --
R:  Yeah, they're -- they're smart.
L:  -- we had one dog, we'd say -- we'd -- we'd say -- it was another poodle and we'd say, "Get --" you know, we'd get the keys, or if we said, "keys" or "go", boy --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I tell ya, he was --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- standing at the door and was not going to be left home.
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  Um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  My uh -- when we take our dogs to go -- well, especially the poodle, when we take the poodle we got visit my in laws --
R:  Mhm?  
L:  -- they live about six hours away so we have -- we take the dogs with --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And my mother in law, she doesn't -- she doesn't really care for having the dog -- the dogs in the house.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, they want the dogs outside, but when we bring Opie and that, we let him --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in the house and she just kind of -- she tolerates him.  She's not really mean to him, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he -- she sits down, he runs and sits right on her lap, right by her.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  And she's just going, "I don't like you, dog.  How come you do that?" and it's like he --
