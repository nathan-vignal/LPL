L:  Oh, hello --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- my name's John.
R:  Hi, I'm Dorothy.
L:  Oh, hi, Dorothy.  Do you have any pets?
R:  No, my last pet died.
L:  Oh god. [LAUGH] What was that?
R:  A cat.
L:  Oh, okay. [MN]
R:  I called him Shadow.
L:  Oh, was it a black cat?
R:  Mhm, with just a sprinkling of white hairs like stars on the night sky --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Oh that --
R:  -- and he really loved me.
L:  Oh, that's sad.
R:  "I had a little shadow that went in and out with me, and what could be the use of ye, I see, I see, I see".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Do you have a pet?
L:  Uh, no, Dorothy, I don't. I, see, no, I've never really had pets growing up.  Um, like, I -- we lived, uh -- we didn't have much of a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- yard growing up, so, I've never had one, so, uh, you know, it's kind of neat, like, uh, I've just never, you know, I've loved animals, but it's just never been my thing.
R:  Mm.
L:  Uh, actually, oh, I take that back, I have had goldfish in the past, but I don't know if that really counts.
R:  Yeah, well a cat's the best pet to start with.
L:  Uh, uh, why's that?
R:  [SIGH] Because a cat is fairly independent.
L:  Oh, right, right, right. You don't have --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to take care of it as much.  So, how long ago did you lose your cat?
R:  Uh, about a year or two.
L:  Okay, and you don't want to get another one?
R:  Uh, well, I'm still grieving over Shadow. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, gosh, that's really sad.
R:  Yeah, and if I want to pet a cat, I go over to my father's house [LIPSMACK] and pet Shadow's sister.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Uh, y- -- Shadow's sister's name is Suey[?].
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  "Suey, pig, pig, pig."
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that's hilarious.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  And -- so do you live --
R:  She earned her --
L:  -- close to your father?
R:  -- she earned her name.  Uh, when she was a kitten --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- we had four cats and the mother cat and we had a big, uh, you know, the, uh, Christmas tree base thing?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That you put water in for the christmas tree?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  We had one of those --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- about two, three feet across --
L:  Oh, you must have had a big tree.
R:  -- well, no, we just got it for the, uh, cat food dish.
L:  Okay.
R:  Anyway, we would put it out, filled with dry cat food and Suey would climb in it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- not eat from the edge, climb in it --
L:  Oh, my god. [LAUGH]
R:  -- and spread out as much as she could --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- covering as much food as she could --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and growled at any cat --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that came near --
L:  [LAUGH] Wow, so her pi- --
R:  -- until she was done eating.
L:  Oh, that's funny.
R:  As I said, she earned her name.
L:  Yeah, you got that right. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  What -- what about the other two cats, are they still around?
R:  Uh, no, we had to take 'em to the Humane Society --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- we couldn't afford to keep four cats --
L:  That is quite a lot.
R:  -- and the mother cat was a wild cat that escaped.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LAUGH] We trapped her when she was pregnant [MN] --
L:  Oh, okay.  So, is -- is that wildness kind of passed on to the -- the kids?
R:  Um --
L:  The kittens?
R:  -- it did for Shadow --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- sort of.  I was the only human he would interact with --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- on a regular basis.  My mother lived with me at the time and, um, at the time he was born, and he would tolerate her --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I mean, literally, he would only tolerate her --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but he would follow me around.
L:  Oh, wow.  You must have a way with animals.
R:  [LAUGH] Sort of my mother, usually -- but --
L:  But not in this case, uh?
R:  -- Shadow was a one person cat --
L:  I see.
R:  -- [SIGH] so, uh --
L:  Was -- was he pretty wild, like, would he be good about killing, uh, like, rats or mice around, or -- or --
R:  We didn't have any mice around and I kept him an indoor cat --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- you know. [MN] It was kind of fun.  Uh, his sister will catch mice --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- play with them and release them.
L:  Oh, wow, a humane cat, I guess there's such a thing. [LAUGH]
R:  Eventually i- -- she plays rough, eventually she'll kill it --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but she won't eat it --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- uh-huh.
L:  That's really interesting.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so do -- do you live close to your father, are you able to visit the other cat very often?
R:  Oh, yes, um, about three miles away.
L:  Oh, what part of the country are you from?
R:  [MN] North west.
L:  Okay, yeah, I'm from --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- uh, northern California.  I don't know if you'd quite count that as north west.
R:  Um --
L:  I live in Washington DC now.
R:  -- where in nor- northern California?
L:  Uh, San Francisco area, a town called Concord.
R:  Uh, um, do you know where Turlock, California is?
L:  Yeah, absolutely.
R:  My mother was born there.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I've a few friends there --
R:  My -- 
L:  -- at college.
R:  -- uh, three sisters were born there and my brother was born there.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  [LAUGH] [MN]
L:  That's a neat little town, it's really growing a lot, I think, that whole central valley area's growing so much.
R:  Yeah.  Um, [NOISE] do you know a lot of people there?
L:  [MN] Uh, I'm thinking of one guy, specifically, um, I can't think of his last name, his first name's Jay, he's about my age, about twenty five, um --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- oh, Bremm[?], the Bremm family, I don't know if that means anything to you.
R:  No, um.  Does Bruce family mean anything to you?
L:  Uh, no, not in Turlock, I'm afraid.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Is that your mother's family?
R:  Yeah, that's my mother's maiden name, Bruce.
L:  Oh, okay.  Hmm.
R:  Um, is there still a Baptist church there?
L:  Um --
R:  There used to be Swedish Baptist.
L:  Yeah, I'm not sure, I couldn't tell you that, to be honest, um, have you -- do you go back and visit there very often, or ...
R:  No.
L:  Okay. [MN]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, are -- are you in Washington or S- -- or Oregon or --
R:  Oregon.
L:  Oh, okay.  One --
R:  You know where the cap- capital is?
L:  Uh, Salem?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Is that where you are?
R:  No, I'm just north of that.
L:  Okay, so you're one of --
R:  In Keizer.
L:  -- those California ex-pats?  In, sorry, where?
R:  In Keizer.
L:  Oh, okay.  So, you're close to Portland then, right?
R:  No, I'm about three miles north of Salem.
L:  Oh, okay, hm.
R:  [LAUGH] Actually, Keizer borders on Salem.
L:  Okay.  Oh, you know, I've never been there, I've never been to Oregon at all, I'd really like to go.
R:  Oh, yeah.  It's nice.
L:  Must be really pretty and green up there.
R:  Mhm. [SIGH]
L:  Did you -- did you get a lot of rain this year?
R:  Oh, off and on --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- Oregon is a very rainy state.
L:  Sure, sure.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I've heard it looks a lot like Ireland, actually, with all the hills and green and everything.
R:  Mm, I'm not sure, I've never been to Ireland.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LAUGH] I'm not Irish.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm not British.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH] So --
R:  I'm just plain old American. [MN] [LAUGH]
L:  Oh good. [LAUGH] Oh that's funny.  Yeah, I was a real --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- west coast kid myself, until I came out to Washington.
R:  Yeah.  But you -- you should get a cat --
L:  Really?
R:  -- an older cat.
L:  Why an older cat?
R:  A kit- kitten will take, um, more attention --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- 'cause you have to train it --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you get an older cat, it's already trained.
L:  Oh, right.  And do the cats kind of just train themsel- -- or you have to train them to use the litter box and everything, right?
R:  [SIGH] Yes.
L:  Mm.
R:  Unless you want an indoor, outdoor cat.
L:  Okay, and they just go outside if they're outdoor, huh?
R:  And one thing about a cat, when it likes you --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it will come and, uh, cuddle in your lap and purr.  There's been studies on cats' purrs --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, uh, it's -- supposedly helps you relax.
L:  Huh, it is a soothing sound, isn't it?
R:  Mhm, a very soothing sound --
L:  Well, that's neat.
R:  -- you know [MN].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh god, that's funny.
R:  But, if you get a cat, you do not want it to be --
