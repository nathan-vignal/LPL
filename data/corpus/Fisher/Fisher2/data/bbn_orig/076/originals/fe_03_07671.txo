L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  [LAUGH]
R:  Hi.  [LAUGH]
L:  This is weird.
R:  Yeah.  Um, so pets, huh?
L:  I didn't hear what she just said though 'cause somebody was talking.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  She said ...
R:  She said something about the topic was pets and that --
L:  Talking about ...
R:  -- like, saying like what pets you have and like how important they are to you or something like that.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I have pets.
R:  What kind?  [LAUGH]
L:  I have -- I have two -- two cats.  [LAUGH]
R:  How many?
L:  Two.
R:  Oh, two?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Mm.  I have just a bird and a fish.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, what kinda bird?
R:  It's a Cockatiel.
L:  Uh-huh.  Well, see, I have like kitties and I usually come home and cuddle with 'em.  So, what's the difference between having kitties and having birds and fish do you think?
R:  Well, basically the bird I just have it for my little five year old sister.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So that she can have some type of pet that she can somewhat play with.  But dogs and -- and cats for me are just too time consuming as far as like taking care of 'em and all that.  So ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  We used to have a dog, but I had to give it to a family member 'cause we just couldn't take care of it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'd rather -- you know, you have to like give 'em some love and stuff.  So, I felt bad, you know, just seeing -- you know, getting here and just give him the food and that was about it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well, I think that's good, like if you gave him to somebody who could spend more time with him.
R:  Yeah, and they have like more space and he can run around and do whatever --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and there were other dogs.  So, he wasn't lonely.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  That's awesome.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, so ten minutes, huh?
L:  Yep.  [LAUGH]  So ...
R:  I wonder where it's at, like one minute?  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know.  [LAUGH]  Um, so my cats are pretty important to me I guess.  I had a cat that like completely changed my life because, um, we had this cat for like six or seven years and we were both, um, smokers the whole time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he ended up developing asthma and then like basically keeling over and dying [LAUGH] because he had heart problems and lung problems.  It was just --
R:  Oh, my gosh!
L:  -- which was really, really sad and we ended up quitting smoking and it just became like this huge thing and like he was such an important cat to us.  So, we just do not like -- I guess we are so like -- I don't know -- just anti smoking or something.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We just didn't think about it, you know, didn't make the connection?
R:  Didn't realize.
L:  Yeah, and so I don't know.  That was kind of a big deal.  So, that was this time last year and then I got --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- and then my parents moved away and they gave me their cat when -- when they moved away.  I don't know why.  And then we got a kitty -- a little kitten, who was born next door, to keep him company and that's about it.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I know when I was little I had a dog for several years, but it was a long time ago.
L:  Yeah.  I've never had a dog.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  I like dogs.  My cat -- my parents are really into cats.  We just always had a bunch of 'em hanging around, you know?  I guess we never got dogs 'cause we thought they might eat the cats or something.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I've never -- I like cats, but I don't know why I wouldn't have 'em as pets.  Like, they don't seem to like me that much like, you know, cats tend to like get -- I don't know -- like I've heard of mean cats, you know?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I've like visited people where like the cats don't like me.  So, I'm like, um --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- maybe -- maybe I'm not a cat person.  [LAUGH]
L:  They can easily tell like who the cat people are, but maybe they think that you don't like them.
R:  That I'm not ...  [LAUGH]
L:  But you know what?  Some people -- like you have to br- -- you have to raise cats a certain way.  Like, some people just don't do it right and then so their cats end up being weird and they just are like really anti social --
R:  Really?
L:  -- and they don't wanna be held and stuff.  My brother's cats are that way and I just don't understand like -- so they must not play with them very much or something --
R:  Oh, my gosh!
L:  -- 'cause mine like go over to everyone.  I'm always thinking that someone's gonna like take them home with home [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- 'cause they always just like go over to the neighbor's house and like hang out over there, you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] There's, um -- I have, um -- one family member, he's like my godfather, that had, uh, moved into a house where there was like a cat that used to always like go by the house and I guess it was like the previous owner's or something and they just basically left it there --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- and he -- he's a big cat person, him and his wife, and -- but, you know, they started, you know, feeding the cat and all this and didn't really like that cat that much but, you know, they had two of their -- like house cats.  So, with this one they just feeding him and -- and doing all that and then the cat somehow like got sick or had -- had some type of, uh, disease.  So, they started taking him to the vet and all this stuff and they like spent like four thousand dollars on that cat for like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- vets and like some surgery and -- and all this and, I mean, the cat ended up -- they had to put him to sleep at the end 'cause the -- the next surgery was like m- just more painful and more risky than --
L:  Oh, my God!
R:  -- than [LAUGH], you know -- you know, just putting him to sleep and I'm like oh, my God!  They spent four thousand dollars on the cat.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, that's a lotta money [LAUGH] --
L:  That is a lot.
R:  -- and for a cat that wasn't even theirs to begin with.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I guess sometimes you just feel like responsible for this life, you know, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and you ...  I had a friend who just went through something similar to that.  He couldn't afford it at all and then the cat ended up being put to sleep.  But, you know, like he just felt like he couldn't live with himself if he didn't do all that he could.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've -- I've been thinking that I wanna get some fish though.  What kinda fish do you have?
R:  You know what?  I'm not completely sure.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know that it's -- it's just one little fish.  It's pretty cute, um --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it's like this purplish color.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, it's just a little fish.  It's hard enough for me to remember to give it food --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, like three times a day.  [LAUGH]
L:  What, um -- what -- oh, I've forgot what I was gonna say.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, what's the fish's name?
R:  Magenta.
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
R:  My little sister named it because ...
L:  Oh.
R:  She just looked at it and she's like Magenta and I was like hey, that was pretty good 'cause she was like four when we got it and I was like -- you know, her naming it because of the color.  Okay.
L:  Oh, that's so cute.
R:  Pretty good thinker.  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  We have a fish at the magazine that I work at and there's this fish and we call it Mascot.  I don't know how he ended up there.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But he's like really cool.  I forget what kind he is, but they're only supposed to live like two months, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and this one has ended up living like two years and --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- he even froze in the winter, like it got so cold here and the apartment didn't have heat and he froze one night and he's still alive.
R:  Oh, my gosh!
L:  I guess 'cause amphibians can do that.  I don't really know.  But it was very odd.
R:  Oh, my gosh!  He froze?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  It -- it was very odd and -- and he's called Mr. Chompy and then his owner went away and moved to Boston and left him and then he like moved to this place and he's still alive [LAUGH] and -- and --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- but, uh -- but like I got really attached to this fish [LAUGH], like I never thought that could happen, but like I don't know.  We would always come in the office and be like hello, Chompy, and when we were away on the weekends we'd like worry about Chompy and I'd have to stop by and like feed him and make sure that he was okay --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and so it was really -- everybody was like -- I don't know -- we just felt like there was something special about this fish because it just would not die.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  It was like supernatural.
R:  That's so funny.
L:  That was pretty funny when he froze.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my gosh!  I don't even know how long this fish is supposed to live.  It's -- it's been with us for like a year now.  So, I don't even know.  [LAUGH]  I'm really bad at that.
L:  I need to learn more about fish.  I don't know anything about them.  That's what I realized with Mr. Chompy.  He just ...
R:  I just k- knew like I'd buy her a pet -- well, actually I didn't personally buy it, but then I went to buy like the food and I was just like -- you know, what is the fish?  And I was like I need to buy food for the fish.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They like gave me the food and all I do is just feed it.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I know.  They're pretty easy living animals -- or pets I guess.
R:  Yeah.  The bird is enough work as it is cleaning out the cage and all that.
L:  I bet.
R:  But ...
L:  Are the Cockatiels the ones with the little things on their head?
R:  Um, yeah.
L:  Like at the top of their head?  What do you call that thing?
R:  I have no idea.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm so bad.
L:  I've never had a bird either.  We -- well, my Grandma had a bird and while I was staying with her one time -- I kinda think this is my fault, I'm not sure -- but the bird like flew away and, um --
R:  Oh, my gosh!
L:  -- and I didn't wanna completely take responsibility, but I did let it outta the cage [LAUGH] and so -- but like she cried and cried and I kinda thought it was a little bit funny because I was little and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- yeah, I just never thought that I could be responsible for a bird after that.
R:  Oh, wow!  Well, this bird I got it because, um, it was an -- an older couple bird and they moved in with their son and their son has this dog and they -- with this Cockatiel we let her loose like a lot inside the house --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because they used to do it too, they used to just let her fly around the house.  So, they -- you know, this -- the older couple's son had this dog and they were like, you know, we can't let the bird around loose with the dog 'cause, you know, we don't know how friendly they're gonna be to each other.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So -- so they gave it to -- so, they gave it to my sister.
