R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.  My ...  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  How are you?
R:  Good.  Um ...
L:  Great.
R:  My name's Laurie.
L:  Hi, I'm Adrienne.
R:  Hello.  And where are you from?
L:  I'm from Manhattan, New York.
R:  Manhattan, New York.  Wow!  Um ...
L:  Where you from?
R:  Ocala, Florida.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, wow!  That's more ...
R:  Way down here.
L:  Yeah.  How's the weather over there?
R:  Very rainy.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I don't know what to do.  I know I'm supposed to ask about a certain topic and I'm like completely lost 'cause this is the first time I'm doing this.
R:  Oh, okay.  It's -- it's, um, do you have a pet and, um, I guess if so how -- how long do you -- how many hours a day do you spend with your pets and how important is your pet to you and all that kinda pet stuff.
L:  Okay.  So, I don't have a pet.
R:  You don't have a pet?
L:  No, I'm actually trying to get a cat.
R:  Oh, you're trying to get a cat?
L:  Yeah, I'm trying to adopt a cat.
R:  Oh.  Um ...
L:  So, that should be done in about two weeks.
R:  Oh, that's kinda neat.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is it from an -- an animal shelter or a rescue?
L:  It's an animal shelter.
R:  Okay.
L:  But they wanna like verify employment and all this other stuff.
R:  Well, at least they'll know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's got a good home.  But, yeah, that seems kind of [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, I know.  I know. 
R:  -- overboard.  Yeah, we've got some places here that, uh -- that do cats.  I don't have a cat.  I have a dog.
L:  You have a dog.  What type of dog?
R:  He is -- what do I call him? -- a multi breed.  That sounds more bet- -- it sounds bet- --
L:  A multi breed.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it sounds better than a mute, but he's -- he's a mute.  [LAUGH]
L:  He's a mute.  Okay.  How old?
R:  We, uh, got -- his name's Barney --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and we got him from a friend of ours who took in, uh, an abandoned dog who happened to be pregnant and ended up having seven boy puppies.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, we okay, we're gonna be moving into a house.  So, give us the friendliest one.  So [LIPSMACK], they picked out Barney and he's a very interesting dog.  [LAUGH]
L:  And how long have you had him?
R:  We've had him a year -- just under a year.  We got him I think July last year.  But he's a little over a year old and he's pretty much the kid.
L:  Oh, he's pretty much the kid of the house?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, 'cause we don't have kids.  So -- so ...
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  In fact I was just, uh, um, lamenting.  I -- I didn't work this year.  I'm an elementary school teacher and, um, I'm gonna be going -- go back -- [LAUGH] going back to work this year.
L:  Oh, you're a school -- yeah, what grade do you teach?
R:  Um, I've taught second grade and I taught one year in, um, uh, E.S.C. resource room --
L:  Okay.  All right.
R:  -- um, where kids come with learning difficulties --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and, um, that was K. through five.  So, um -- so, just all -- all -- whatever grade.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  This year I wasn't anything 'cause I'm in a new county and we moved from Gainesville, Florida [inaudible] county.
L:  Oh, so, you've been there, what, like a year?
R:  Yeah.  Oh, just a year in August --
L:  Well, that's not too ...
R:  and, uh, so I -- I don't know what I'm gonna do with it.  I -- I mean, he can stay home by himself, um, you know, he can hold ...
L:  Well, what do you normally work, like from nine to three?
R:  Well, eight -- seven to [LAUGH] four, five, six.
L:  Oh, so the dog will be by itself.
R:  Yeah.  We thought about getting a new dog, you know, another dog for, uh --
L:  For company, yeah, I would do that.
R:  -- for company, but didn't wanna get a dog with -- an older dog with bad habits, but we don't have time to train a new puppy yet.  So --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- he trained easily though.  He quick trained in -- in, uh -- 
L:  Oh, that was lucky. 
R:  -- in about ...
L:  Well, you have a yard, right?
R:  We have a yard.
L:  Okay.
R:  He digs.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  Loves to dig.  He ...
L:  You see, that's the difference.  Here it's an apartment.  So, it's like you really have to potty train them or --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- take them out two or three times a day and --
R:  Yeah.  He --
L:  -- get ...
R:  -- he -- the only time he's ever -- you know, he ever has accidents inside is when he's sick and -- so that kind of stuff.  So ...
L:  [MN] That's why I wanna cat.  I don't have to walk it --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- you know, and they play when they wanna be played with, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  They'll come to you.  I mean, I've had pets.  I've had dogs and I've had cats, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I've had 'em for quite a few years and I've always lived in the city.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, it's like when I had the dog I always had time to walk the dog and now I'm working fulltime.  So, things -- you know, the schedule has changed.  So ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  But my dog passed away after twelve years --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and -- so she was ...
R:  See, that would've broken my ...  I -- I had a guinea pig once that died and -- and I -- I cried.  [LAUGH]
L:  You -- well, that was the last dog I had.  After that I was like okay, I can't go through this anymore, so, um ...
R:  They're too much like people.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then, I mean, this dog actually slept with me, you know?  He had his own pillow --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- and he just slept with me, you know?  So, after that it was like losing somebody.  So, I was like, you know what?  Never again will I have another pet.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  That was the end of that and I'll --
R:  Well, actually --
L:  -- go for a cat.
R:  -- they actually have something here, um, at our vet they also do boarding and they have doggie day care.  [LAUGH]  So, whenever we --
L:  Doggie ...
R:  -- whenever we go outta town we drop him off for boarding and whenever there's doggie day care he gets to go play with the guys.
L:  [NOISE] Mm.  Okay.  That's not bad.  That's not -- how much does it cost?
R:  Um, now that he's bigger it costs more.  [LAUGH]  But it -- I think it's [SIGH] -- we paid about I guess a hundred dollars and that was for four -- five days.
L:  Oh, that's not bad.
R:  So, that included boarding and, um -- and day care --
L:  Oh, that's not bad.
R:  -- and a nail clipping, which ...
L:  It's like having a baby, right?  [LAUGH]
R:  Hm?
L:  It's like having a child and paying day care.
R:  It is --
L:  You know?
R:  -- and, you know, especially when they get sick it's like having a little -- you know, a little kid 'cause they can't tell ya exactly.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know.  I know.  I know.  That's why I said to myself, you know what, I don't wanna dog because it's -- it's a lot more responsibility than a cat.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I love 'em.  Don't get me wrong, you know?  But --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's like having a baby around, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like I wanna go for a walk, I wanna get fed, you know?  A cat just normally goes to the bathroom.  You don't have to walk 'em to the litter.
R:  Yep.
L:  You know?  So, it's a little bit more convenient for me and I have two children of my own anyway.  So --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- I -- you know, I said another dog would be like having three children.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Exactly.
L:  You know?  I said no way.  [LAUGH]
R:  How old are your kids?
L:  I have, uh, a fourteen year old and a five year old.
R:  Wow!  That's a --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- that's a spread.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  That was definitely a spread.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, they -- I think that ...  Are they excited about getting a cat?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, this is the first time you've done this or you've done this before?
R:  First time.  I actually just signed up today.  I figured it would take, you know, three days or so.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's what I thought.  So, now I'm looking at my phone ringing.  I'm like okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know?  [LAUGH]  I thought okay, this -- and I don't recognize the number.  So, I was like okay, this has to be done of those calls, which I've never done and, um, I actually was just getting out of the office and walking home.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  So, I was like oh, I don't -- I don't even have a pen to write the question down.
R:  Oh, no.  [LAUGH]
L:  You know?  [LAUGH]  I said oh.  But it's -- yep, what is it, I guess it probably lasts for a few weeks?  [NOISE]
R:  I -- I'm not sure.  I saw it on a -- a -- a web page that I, um -- that I signed up for and, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a newsletter that I get and so I said oh --
L:  Yeah.  I ...
R:  -- that sounds kind of interesting, you know?  I like to talk.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I said, wow, you're all the way from over there.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, no, no, no.  The distance -- well, I don't think we'll get ...  What do they do, connect you automatically to me?
R:  I think so.  They -- they got me on the line and then they asked, um, where, um -- oh, stay on the line 'til we find someone else.
L:  Oh, okay.  That's not bad.
R:  Yeah.  So ...
L:  That's not bad.  It's actually interesting.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It's, um, um ...
L:  [NOISE] Hello?
R:  Oh, I'm still here.  [LAUGH]
L:  I thought I -- I thought it cut off.  I was like oh, my gosh!  Um, I don't even know what to ask more about animals.  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] So, you had your other ...  What was that?  Oh, I'm making dinner.  Um, so you had your other dog for twelve years you said?
L:  Twelve years.  Twelve years.
R:  Did you get her as a puppy?  [NOISE]
L:  Uh, yeah, it was, uh, a Pit Bull and I had him since he was born.  Probably like six weeks later.
R:  A Pit Bull?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's kinda -- I think -- I think Barney has some Pit Bull in him.
L:  Mm.
R:  We're not sure.  He's, um, mostly black --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and when he's panting he looks like a Pit Bull.
L:  Okay.
R:  When he's got his mouth closed he looks like a Black Lab.
L:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, he loves to dig.  So, the pit bulls are part Terrier.  So, that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, that would make sense.  He's got the little moles like a Rottweiler though.
L:  Yeah.
R:  He's about sixty pounds --
L:  Okay.  [NOISE]
R:  -- and very expressive.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, how Pit Bulls will actually look at ya not necessarily as a confrontation?  They just -- they're very expressive and ...
L:  Yeah.  Is that the first one that you have?
R:  Our first dog.  Yep.
L:  Oh, that's great.  That's great.  I ...
R:  We're thinking -- 'cause he's not much of a lap dog though.  He needs to be really tired to get any kind of cuddling.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] So, we were thinking about getting a Greyhound because we thought for the longest time that, you know, they had to run and, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- someone that we know rescues Greyhounds and she said no, they're couch potatoes.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, they are?
R:  I said oh, a couch potato could work.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.  You know the ones I think are the -- the -- the one [NOISE] -- the ones that look like wolves.
R:  Um ...
L:  I forgot -- oh, my gosh!  Siberian?
R:  Siberian Huskies?
L:  Yeah.  Oh, my God!  I love their eyes.
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  They're like so beautiful.
R:  And now Huskies are the ones with the same color, right?
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  And then they have the [inaudible].
L:  Yeah.  They have like the same gray color.  Oh, my ...  But they have to be kept in a certain temperature.  So, they aren't really good for the city.
R:  Or down --
L:  You know?
R:  -- in Florida either.  [LAUGH]
L:  No.  Yeah.  I know.  I know.  It was funny 'cause my son was just telling me he's going to Florida.
R:  Oh, they are?
L:  You know?  Yeah.  I don't know where, but some time in July or August for a vacation.
R:  You'll probably get some good deals 'cause --
