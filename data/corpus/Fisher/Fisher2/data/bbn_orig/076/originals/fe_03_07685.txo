L:  [LIPSMACK] Greetings.  Good afternoon.
R:  Hi.
L:  My name is Arvy Goliday.  I live in Los Angeles, California, and I work with, uh, kids in development projects of education as well as developmentally disabled, as well with the Christian Youth Foundation.  Our website is W.W.W. dot --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- Christian Youth Foundation dot org.
R:  I always just give --
L:  That's sterile.
R:  -- my name.
R:  [LAUGH] My name is Maryanne.  What's your name, Arby?
L:  Arvy Goliday.  That's A.R.V. --
R:  Arv- --
L:  -- Y. G.O.L.I.D.A.Y.
R:  Arvy.
L:  And the organization is Christian Youth Foundation.
R:  Great, um, so the topic is, um ?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Life partners.
R:  What -- what you look for in a life partner, right?
L:  Should I begin?
R:  What?
L:  No, should I begin?
R:  Sure, go ahead.
L:  Okay.  In relationships and life partners, I think that there should be a common objective.  Ah, no relationship is good without -- without a common objective.  In other words I think all, uh, matters of association in relationships should be built around a project.  So if there's no project in the, uh, structure of a relationship then there's basically no rela- relationship.
R:  Interesting.  What kind of project do you mean?
L:  Uh, projects --
R:  Like what's an example?
L:  -- that enhance the nature of wellbeing, good for all so if this C- C- Christianity does a good project.  If it's, um, housing that's another project.  If it's economical base that's another project.  If it's educational based, that's another project.  Something should be given to a relationship that embodies the nature of something good for all.
R:  Okay.  So, you think that a relationship or a life partner should be goal oriented?
L:  Hey, God, you're bright.  I really do.
R:  Are you being sarcastic?
L:  No, I mean you are.  I mean I didn't even expect that.  Sarcastic is not --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- what I'm talking about.  I'm not here to insult people or belittle anybody or to pressure anybody or to be biased.  I'm saying that you're great.  It's a great idea.  That's what I'm saying.  Generally [inaudible] I mean it.  Sarcastic, no.
R:  +Okay.  Um, but what about if you just happen to fall in love with someone and, uh, you don't necessarily have an agenda?
L:  Well, that's another subject matter and that's the exception to the rule so, uh, that's another, uh, endeavor that requires, you know, what love carries.
R:  Uh, so then what would be the goal?  What would be the --
L:  Well, I mean, that's another --
R:  -- project as you call it?
L:  That's -- that's another situation.  I'm saying that's the exception to the rule.  If you fall in love with somebody, or somebody catches your eye and then love ensued, then love would carry you through whatever there is to go so I can't really speak on that because that's never occurred to me.  No, I'll take that back.  I fell in love with my second grade teacher but seemingly she doesn't -- didn't understand.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I don't -- I don't know that that's the exception.  I think that --
L:  Well, y- --
R:  -- the majority of people you talk to would say that they fell in love with their life partner before they were looking.  I mean I --
L:  Well, if that's the case, uh --
R:  -- it's not the case --
L:  -- that's the case, uh, then that doesn't apply to my understanding.  That's out of my realm of comprehension so perhaps you should talk.
R:  [LAUGH] No, I'm very cur- -- I've never in my life heard anybody discuss it in these terms.  It --
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- it seems --
L:  Well, I mean, actually I look at life quite differently because I'm not a person that looks for collateral damage or collateral wellbeing.  I'm here to do something in life that would benefit everybody else, and that's my purpose of life, and that's my association with anybody who has a similar purpose to go forward in a way that we would be able to make the world a better world.  So, that's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the bottom line for me.  As far as love, I don't consider it to be a -- a fairy tale.  I consider it to be a reality for some people but it has never happened to me other than wh- -- other than reason I just mentioned which was my second grade teacher.
R:  [LAUGH] So, you, uh, what -- what would happen if you did fall in love with someone?
L:  Well, actually that's a good possibility but seemingly that's remote due to the fact that I'm very inundated and -- and relentless in my actions towards doing and making a better world.  There's a lot of issues that needs to be solved.  I don't know if I can solve them or I don't know if anybody can.  Well, we'll make a attempt.  There's AIDS, there's education, there's homelessness, there's a lot of other things that are plaguing our society as we live and those are the issues that I would like to address with my life as the Lord Jesus Christ and others have done.  The wise men and the prophets and that's what I believe that I should be doing as well.
R:  Mhm.  So you have sort of a monastic, uh, view on it in terms of --
L:  Being monastic means what?
R:  Monastic.  Like a monk?
L:  Oh, no.  I don't think I'm a monk.  I think I'm a --
R:  No, I --
L:  -- Christian with common sense.  A little less and sometimes a little more and I think all of the wise men and prophets were people of wi- -- of common sense as well.
R:  I, uh -- you didn't let me finish.  I was saying --
L:  I do apologize.
R:  I was saying, you -- I think it sounds like you have a monastic view in terms of you are focused on, uh, making --
L:  Wellbeing.
R:  -- the world a better place.  You know.
L:  Yes.
R:  The goals that you have and so --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- a life partner doesn't necessarily fit into that?
L:  Well, a life partner does fit into that -- as I said to you before, it's a matter of, uh, project, uh -- I think projects are very, very important in relationships and I think it makes more relationships meaningful and you've just said that goal so I think you used that term and that's the point that I'm speaking about.
R:  Right.  Um, well it's a -- it's very different from my perspective.  I think, uh, uh, I don't really look for something in a life partner.  I just happened to fall in love with the person that I fell in love with and --
L:  Well, I don't necessarily look for anything myself.  It's just that my goal is to desire in such a matter for the wellbeing of all others and it's so if in conversation and association, those are my, uh --
R:  Right.
L:  -- priorities, uh, wellbeing, consideration, compassion, kindness for those that are less fortunate and there's a lot of this in the world and this is my obligation I believe otherwise I wouldn't be in the position that I am.  I've started about three other organizations and they all have the common interest and goal as well.  I can definitely see you s- -- see you as being a person that use the, uh, common sense approach to things and possibilities as well and I have nothing against that and I do wish you well.  And hopefully there will be more people like you that's help keep the, uh, society going as well.
R:  Oh, thank you.  [LAUGH]
L:  Now, on the other side of everything else, uh, have you ever, uh, considered, uh, dedicating your life for some purpose in regards to those that are less fortunate?
R:  Um, I don't -- i- i- it's not a career.  I'm a -- I'm a writer.
L:  Congratulations.
R:  I try to, uh -- thank you.
L:  What do you write?
R:  Uh, screen plays and also plays.
L:  Oh, wow.  That's fantastic.
R:  So, I -- I deal with --
L:  You deal with imagination.  You deal with fiction or you deal with what?
R:  Um, yeah, some are completely fictional.  Some are based on experiences that I've had.
L:  How many books have you written?
R:  Uh, screen plays --
L:  How many screen plays have you written?
R:  I've written nine.
L:  Congratulations.
R:  And also a couple of plays.  But they haven't been --
L:  So --
R:  -- made into films.  So 
L:  Okay, so what is your --
R:  Don't get too excited.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, well, I mean, you know, I'm just asking.  I'm excited because I've never r- -- I never talked to a screen writer before.  Uh, there's a gentleman by the name of Richard Clyber[?] Lear[?].  We had a, uh, play reading of one of his, uh, plays.  He's written about five or six.  He's written about five books --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and one of the plays was "Speaking of Charlie" and it embodied the nature of, uh, sexual orientation and the matter of, uh, AIDS as a deterrent.  The basic structure for, you know, AIDS awareness and we send the invitation to over three hundred churches in the Los Angeles metropolitan area and, uh, we're also doing another feature which was, um, um, practical word power which is an educational component because there's a lot of liter- illiterate people -- youngsters in the area and a lot of, uh, people that can't really speak English so this was the content of the program so we sent it out.  The City of I-, er, of Inglewood allowed us to use their Park Theatre and, uh, no one responded out of three hundred, uh, invitations.  I was shocked that --
R:  Really?
L:  -- churches would not be interested i- in the plague that is affecting, uh, predominantly African American people, as well as education, and I was just astonished and, um --
R:  Well [MN] --
L:  -- without any logic to why they didn't respond.  And so I made about fifty calls after it and then nobody responded to that and I say, "Well, the churches turn a deaf ear to the, uh, nature of something that is very important in community life, [inaudible] abatement and education as an enhancement".
R:  What kind of --
L:  Shocking.
R:  What churches were you sending it to?
L:  [SIGH]
