L:  Hello?
R:  Oh, hi.  [LAUGH]
L:  Hi.
R:  Are you my call partner?
L:  Yes, I'm your call partner.
R:  Okay.  Uh, my name is Cher.
L:  Hi, my name is Rick.
R:  Rick.  Hi, Rick.
L:  How ya doing?
R:  Uh, fine.  [LAUGH]
L:  Sh- --
R:  Uh, our topic is, uh, what qualities to look for in a life partner?
L:  Well, with a name like Cher, I don't know if you'd --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- make a -- a great life partner.
R:  [LAUGH] Um, uh, [MN] obviously someone that I can share with, right?  [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, yeah, somebody that you have interests with, right?
R:  Uh, right, right.  Some compatibility, right?
L:  Right.
R:  Although, um, sometimes, um --
L:  Opposites attract?
R:  Yeah.  A little bit of, uh, uh, the opposite, uh, makes for [MN] you know, more intrigue.
L:  Yeah, like personality wise.
R:  Uh-huh.  Right.
L:  But -- but then it's good to have like the same interests.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, like if the person likes, um, [NOISE] playing baseball, you know, or whatever.  But maybe the other person is -- likes to play baseball too, you know, s- sport.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Uh, that's a bad example.
R:  [MN] But --
L:  Say theatre, you know, whatever.
R:  But somebody's that's [MN] too introverted and somebody that's too extroverted [MN] aren't going to work too well.  You know, somebody --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- likes going to parties all the time and somebody else doesn't, uh, you know, and wants to stay home all the time.  I think you'd run into difficulties so ...
L:  Yeah.  What do you think about, uh, religion and politics?
R:  Um, well, I -- I think, you know, obviously they don't have to be the same religion but --
L:  Right, well that's true.
R:  -- I think having a --
L:  You gets to -- it still be successful.
R:  A common faith, you know, or -- or belief in [LAUGH] you know, I don't think an atheist and a Christian would work too well.  
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know, probably so ... [LAUGH] 
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know.
L:  [MN]
R:  And politics?  I don't know, uh, you know, I think there are a lot of couples that are [LIPSMACK] republicans and democrats and, you know, as long as they don't discuss politics, right?
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's -- it's on the same lines though, right?  I mean, uh, a staunch republican wouldn't get along with a staunch democrat.
R:  Uh --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- yeah, yeah, if you're too -- too --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- one way or the other, right.
L:  Right.
R:  Too -- too much of the extreme, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Moderation in everything, right?
L:  Exactly.
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  Find a balance.
R:  But, uh, you know, as far as qualities in a life partner I think definitely honesty rates way up there at the top, you know.  I was, uh, just thinking though I don't know if you saw the, uh, Hillary Clinton interview on Dave Letterman the other night?  [LAUGH]
L:  The -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh no, you know, I missed --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- that.
R:  Okay, but, you know, obviously he wasn't honest with her at all times but [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, no.  Not at all.
R:  Yeah, but, you know, so she had a lot of, uh -- a lot of things to work through, you know [MN].
L:  I think some stuff came out on him today too.  [several inaudible words]  I don't know.
R:  Uh, on who -- it? [MN]
L:  On Clinton.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] Oh, what was that then?
L:  Well, I don't know.  I was listening to Rush Limbosi[?].
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] okay.  
L:  It could have been, uh ...
R:  [LAUGH] Huh.
L:  It could have been one of his- one of his, uh, tales.
R:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But [MN] -- but don't you agree though that honesty is important in a relationship for ...?
L:  Oh, by all means.
R:  No.  [LAUGH] And I --
L:  But --
R:  Oh, okay, go ahead.
L:  I guess by life partner they mean like marriage, right?
R:  Oh, y- yeah, I assumed.  Someone that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you're gonna be with for life, right.  Yeah.
L:  Right, right.
R:  I [LAUGH] -- I [LAUGH] -- I don't think they mean like, uh [LIPSMACK] -- I don't know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Life partner.  Well, I guess they --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- could be -- you could be toge- together for life without being married, right?
R:  Yeah, yeah, but -- but somebody that you're -- you're with forever.  I think, uh, don't you think a sense of humour too is important?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  S-- some people value that, you know, more than others.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- um, s- some women find that really important and some, you know, they -- they could go either way.
R:  Mhm.  [NOISE]
L:  But, uh ...
R:  But, uh, don't you?  I find people I can laugh with, you know, are people --
L:  That -- that helps.
R:  -- that I -- I bond with --
L:  That definitely helps.
R:  [LAUGH] Bond with.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I find a lot of things amusing actually so ... [LAUGH]
L:  In where?
R:  Oh, I find a lot, you know, life.  I -- I see humour --
L:  Oh, so you find a lot of things amusing.
R:  -- everywhere it seems.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's good.  That's --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] [MN] H- how important do you think, uh, finances are?
L:  Finances?
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  Um, it's important.  You know, it, um, you know -- you can't be with somebody that has champagne taste and then you have a beer budget, you know.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Right, right.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  It kind -- it all depends on the person.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, if somebody, um, you know, places too much value on material things and the other person is more, uh --
L:  Right, you -- you definitely --
R:  -- experience or what --
L:  -- have to be compatible there.
R:  Yeah, you're gonna have trouble there.  [LAUGH] [MN]
L:  Life --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- partner.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I hope we're helping the study.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, yeah, yes --
R:  So ...
L:  -- yes.  It's interesting though.  I wonder what they do on this?
R:  Yeah, I -- I [MN] well, I think they -- they're recording our voices, you know, to see how -- how to, er, make a robot sound like we do, so ...
L:  How to make a robot [MN] --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I guess so.
L:  Yes.
R:  You know, a -- a -- a -- automated caller, whatever, s- so it sounds more natural.
L:  Really?  Is that what it's about?
R:  Yeah.  I think so.  That's what it's [LAUGH] about.
L:  Huh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Could be anything.  Could be a psychology study.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] God, they might --
L:  So -- so --
R:  -- be hid- --
L:  -- looks.  What do you think about looks in a life partner?
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] it's probably not the most important thing, I don't think, you know.  It [MN] -- I think, um, i- if a person --
L:  Looks are gonna fade, right?
R:  Yeah, and I think it -- it's more the personality or the person, you know, because don't you think, you know, like if a person's really shallow and they're really good looking then they're gonna be kind of --
L:  That's not -- that won't --
R:  -- ugly after a while?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, exactly that's true.
R:  Yeah, yeah, so.  But, initially, I think, um, probably -- especially with men, [MN] looks is what attracts you to someone, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Men are more, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  The -- men are through the eyes more and women are through the ears more.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  My father used to say that.
R:  Oh -- oh, what did your father say about, uh ...?
L:  Uh, you know, that -- that men -- men, uh, fall in love with their eyes and women with their ears.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [MN]
R:  So, women [MN] listen more?  Or --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- not all women but ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah --
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] Now [NOISE] what else is there?  Um ...
L:  [MN] Just getting past those hurdles is, you know, tough.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Let me tell you.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  It's not an easy thing to find someone that's, you know [NOISE] you're compatible with.  I think that, um --
L:  'Cause then I guess if you have a lot on the line, then -- then the little things will --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- take care of themselves.
R:  Yeah, um, certainly, [MN] probably, uh, ah, someone who is forgiving [NOISE] you know, because [NOISE] everybody makes mistakes or whatever.  You'd want a -- a partner that, you know, is willing to forgive you.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  Right.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right, right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Forgiving.
R:  And, uh, not -- not -- not be like real rigid about things and, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  [MN]
L:  [NOISE] Well, I think we're up at about nine minutes now.
R:  We're up to --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- nine minutes.  Are you k- keeping track. [LAUGH]
L:  I was.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Watching.
R:  Uh.  [LAUGH] So, what happens after that then.  The, uh --
L:  After that we cash in.
R:  [LAUGH] Huh.  [PAUSE] So ...
L:  Life partner.  Nobody says --
R:  Life partner.
L:  -- marriage anymore.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I guess they wanna be all inclusive.  You know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Whatever.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, so ... [PAUSE] But, uh ...
L:  So, like would it be any different -- no, I guess it would be the same thing.
R:  [MN] What -- what's that?
L:  Um, a -- a gay relationship versus a straight one.
R:  Oh, [MN] well --
L:  Yes.
R:  I -- I guess so, probably, yeah.
L:  [inaudible] the same thing.
R:  Yeah.  [PAUSE] Yeah, I guess you'd want the same things, right?
L:  Mhm.
R:  No matter who were going to live with.  You wouldn't --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- want someone, [MN] um --
L:  Where are you calling from?
R:  Uh, where are I calling from?  Well, I don't know if that's important.  [LAUGH]
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  [LAUGH] Probably should be confidential, right?  [LAUGH]
L:  You got that right.
R:  Huh, yeah.  I imagine we're from all over the United States.  That right?
L:  Yep, yep.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yep.
R:  'Cause, uh [LIPSMACK] uh, they're doing it in Pennsylvania, right?  
L:  Right.
R:  The University of Pennsylvania, yeah --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so ...  So, [PAUSE] okay.  There must be something else.  Wish I would have known --
L:  No, those are --
R:  -- about the top-
L:  -- those are the main things.  I mean --
R:  You think that --
L:  -- everything else -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- everything else is kinda like trivial because --
R:  Yeah, I mean that -- th- that's the basis or you want someone intelligent too, right?  You know.
L:  That's why when you're --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- young and, you know, you fall in love, you don't really think about those things.  I mean your parents --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- are telling you and those things are really important.  [MN]
R:  Yeah.  The -- the compatible, the things that make you --
L:  Right.
R:  -- compatible.
L:  Right.
R:  Because, yeah, definitely I think like, you know, a difference in values and a difference in money can be a m- major thing.
L:  Can be a snag.
R:  You know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if you're like one wants to spend, one wants [LAUGH] to save.  You gotta --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You have to [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- find some middle ground there.  Uh [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] and then I think, you know, I've seen that too with, [MN] like, somebody that's extremely introverted and somebody extremely extroverted and th- they are [LIPSMACK] attracted to one another for those reasons initially but then it's really hard, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  Because if one person wants to party every night and have people over and the other person's like --
