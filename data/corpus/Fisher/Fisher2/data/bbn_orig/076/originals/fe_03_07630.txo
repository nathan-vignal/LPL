R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  My name is Laurel.
L:  Yes.  My name is Kristy.
R:  And I guess we're supposed to talk about pets.
L:  Okay.  
R:  I have four --
L:  I -- okay.  I don't have any.
R:  [MN].
L:  What kinda pets do you have?
R:  Oh, okay.  This is easy.  I have --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- two, eleven year old dogs.
L:  Okay.
R:  One of them is very large, uh, a mix between a Labrador and a Newfoundland and the other one is a er a Shepherd mix and um the two of them are the same age, adopted from separate families, and then I have kittens.
L:  Oh, boy.
R:  Two kittens.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] I love --
R:  And the two kittens are -- are from the same litter and I adopted them at the local animal shelter and they're about six months old. 
L:  Okay.  Well --
R:  And maybe I should ask you how come you don't have animals [LAUGH].
L:  Huh, well, we have a small yard.  Um, and too, I'm concerned about um all the doggies' waste and stuff, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Stepping in it and everything.  My -- I have two small children, and I'd be concerned they'd be stepping in it all the time and tracking it in the house.
R:  Oh, that sounds reasonable.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  So -- do your dogs -- do they go in certain areas?
R:  No.
L:  Do you have a yard --
R:  No, they go anywhere they want to go [LAUGH].
L:  Okay.  Okay.
R:  Um, it -- the problem in our house is that we're also gardeners --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and that means building all kinds of barricades so that they can't get to the garden because we eat the things out of our garden --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I'm also a gardener too.  Okay.  So that makes sense for me not to get a pet.  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Well, I guess the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Having children with two animals who go wherever they please I can see would pretty much rule it out, but --
L:  Yeah, that's good.
R:  Yeah.  We're working with um, you know, just putting in little fences here, little fences there, to try to redirect them, but the reality is when they feel like it, they go.  And we don't go on -- on walks with them because they're so old.
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  They're -- they're arthritic.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And um I think we're supposed to talk about how -- how much they affect us or whatever [LAUGH] but if you don't have 'em, I guess they don't.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Um [LAUGH] I've never really been without a pet.
L:  Okay.  
R:  Um, I'm fifty six --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and uh --
L:  I'm uh thirty two and I've had pets all up until I've gotten married --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I guess, but it'd be really nice to have some pets without -- my two little girls, they would love to have one.  We're just wanting to get uh you know, a bigger yard.
R:  Bigger yard and probably --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- as they grow up a little, um, you know, they can be taught to not step in a pile.
L:  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Well, my pets are super important to me 'cause I work in literally a crazy setting, which means in a psychiatric hospital.
L:  Oh.  Huh.
R:  Um, when I get home at the end of the day -- yesterday was the worst day I've ever had, um, I can just hear all the patients who are screaming and talking to the walls and --
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  -- screaming at the television or you know, lying on the floor kicking and beating their head into the -- to the wall or -- you know, whatever crazy --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- things that have gone on that day, the animals are -- like when I come home, everything is always the same [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're sitting in their places waiting for their biscuits [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  Looking expectant --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and the cats greet me at the door.
L:  Well, how do the kittens get along with the dogs?
R:  You know, I wasn't too sure because they were really small kittens.  They were actually a little bit young to be adopted and the dogs are really big, so for the first week, um, there was a kit- a kitten room where we had them behind a closed door and I don't know, you have to take the leap at some point --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and one day I just said this -- "We've got to try", and if one of them eats one, you know [LAUGH] we'll feel terrible, but --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  And uh it just -- you just have to get over that hurdle of the first day and after that it's fine.
L:  Yeah.  Huh.  So they get along pretty well?
R:  Um, yeah.  Actually, really well.  It was kinda crazy.  They nurse on one of the dogs.  They've --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  They create fake pretend nipples out of big slots of hair -- fur --
L:  Huh.  Yeah.
R:  -- and they nurse.  Like, and they're still doing it [LAUGH].
L:  Wow.  [LAUGH].
R:  Even though I think they would certainly have been weaned from their mother by now --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, they're sitting up -- yeah, the female especially, will nurse all night [LAUGH].
L:  Oh.  Wow.  
R:  And the dog bathes the kittens.
L:  Oh, well that's neat.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Okay.  
R:  So uh do you think you miss anything by not having a pet, yourself?
L:  Yeah, yeah, definitely because I -- I grew up with animals, lots of cats and dogs, you know -- well, not lot -- lots of cats, but um just different cats, you know, throughout my --
R:  Mhm.  
L:  -- childhood, so yeah, I definitely miss having animals.  Um, if -- if we had cats around here, they will -- afraid they would get on people's cars or somebody would, you know, do something.  We just don't have enough --
R:  This is the first time I've had cats, but um, I made the decision that they're not going to go outside except on a leash.  
L:  Oh.
R:  We had our first leash outing yesterday.
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  Um, because I went through the death of a pet about six months ago and it just was -- it was a little more than that, I guess a year ago, and um he was so mangled by some wild animal --
L:  Oh, my go-
R:  -- that you know I just took him to the vet in shreds and he died shortly thereafter and I just -- you know, personally can't go through it again, so --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  -- um, this time they're indoor cats which means that it's my responsibility to provide a lot of stimulation for them.
L:  Oh, boy.
R:  Which, you know, you go to the store and you buy a lot of stuff, but the reality is, you still have to make time and so I try and spend time with them when I get home from work.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And um it helps me come down from, you know, all the adrenalin rush of all the crazy things the patients have done to me that day [LAUGH].
L:  Golly.  
R:  I'm not necessarily always going to be able to stop [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  So, your patients, uh, do they take you know, sedatives and stuff?
R:  Yeah, um, it's pretty subjective.  It depends on their doctor and they all have different doctors there and then they have different nurses and so sometimes they're well medicated and sometimes they're completely out of control, which was yesterday, and then one patient ju- it only takes one.  We have thirty two.  It only takes one to get the all of them going.  You know?
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  To start fights and --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- um escalate the volume level --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so you feel like you're inside, you know, a -- what do they call those things?  A rave?  You know, like --
L:  Yeah.  Right.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Wow.  Yeah.
R:  I never intended to do this, but the job market in Seattle, which is where I am, has the highest unemployment of every -- any city in --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- the country.
L:  What city is it?
R:  Seattle.  
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Where are you?
L:  Uh, Needle[?] in Texas.
R:  Oh, wow. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is that kind of rural?
L:  Um, yeah, it is.  It -- well, I mean, we live in the middle of the city, but uh it's -- I don't know, the population is -- I don't know, maybe fifty thousand.  
R:  Oh.  Oh, that's a good size city.
L:  Yeah.  But um, yeah, there's a lot a -- you know, just open land when we're driving down the highway, so --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, how about a cat?  Could your two little girls handle that?
L:  Um, probably so, but the thing is, if my husband will let them have a cat.  He's not real fond of cats.
R:  Ah.
L:  [LAUGH].  So --
R:  I was thinking about a prairie dog until they uh issued an injunction last week that pet stores can't sell them any more.
L:  Prairie dogs?
R:  Yeah, but -- do you know what it is?
L:  Yeah.
R:  What it -- what they look like?  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I had just heard about having them for pets, when the monkey pox thing came up --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- that they are the source of it, so they're not going to allow them to be sold anymore, but they're supposedly sweet and pretty easy to take care of.  
L:  Wow.  Huh.
R:  But, in reality, I've got enough on my hands [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  So I think -- let's see.  They asked us how much time we spend with them, and I would say an hour a day for me.
L:  Okay.
R:  And it should be more, and I feel guilty, and they make sure I feel guilty [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].  Well, that's good.
R:  The looping around your legs with that great big sad look and, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- pointing to the cabinet, or trying to get into the cabinet where the dog food is and wedging their way into the refrigerator whenever --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- the door opens.  They have their way [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, that's -- that's sweet.  Uh-huh.  
R:  Yeah.  And um I chose to not have children, so you know --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- they're really -- really a substitute.
L:  That'd be a good substitute, yeah.
R:  Well, they're one at least that I don't have to call a babysitter for, so --
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's a good thing.
R:  Um, but --
L:  You don't have to worry about the babysitter [LAUGH].  I -- you know, what kind of a person, you know, it is, so --
R:  Yeah.  I'd say that um in our house -- household, they play the central importance.  You know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- things are, like -- my partner won't go on vacations because that means that the cats and dogs are left alone, so we go on separate vacations. 
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  So I'd say that it must affect choices, financial and otherwise revolve around pets.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is this your first uh survey over the phone?  I mean, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  Mine, too. 
R:  Yeah, I -- where did you hear about it?
L:  On the internet, from uh --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah --
