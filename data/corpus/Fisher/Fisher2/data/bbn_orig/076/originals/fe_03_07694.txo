R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Jane.
R:  Hi, I'm Mary Lou from Michigan.
L:  I'm Jane from Connecticut.  How are you?  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, fine.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Nice to talk to you.
L:  Nice to talk ...
R:  I hear you have children.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's my two, uh -- two year old [LAUGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- running around naked. 
R:  Oh, that -- that sounds like fun.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, what do you look for in a life partner?
L:  Um, I think the main thing is some kind of common thread, whether it be education or interests or [LIPSMACK], you know, hobbies.  There has to be something that you have in common.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, preferably, you know, maybe something more intellectual than -- than physical or whatever.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, and that --
R:  I think ...
L:  -- to me -- whatever it is that -- that to me is like the most important thing, um, and, you know, everything else is a bonus I guess.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I -- I think so too.  I mean, on an in- intellectual level I think you just have to share, um -- you have to be on the same wavelength --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- more or less --
L:  Mhm.  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, um, I think that the other -- your partner has to be supportive of you whether they share your interests or not --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is not as important as being supportive of what -- whatever it is that you're into.
L:  Well, and I think it's more -- it's easier for a partner to be supportive if -- if they -- you know, if they have like their own -- I mean, like you're both --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- maybe that could be the thing that you have in common is that you're both extremely interested in something or another, you know?
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  When one partner doesn't really have a whole lot of interests and the other partner does I find that's when you run into a lot of problems.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah, that would be -- yeah, that would be really bad.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or, I mean, trying to ...  How long have you been married?
L:  [NOISE] Um, well, actually this is my second marriage.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, my first marriage I was -- I had dated the guy for like six years and then I was married for six years and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that was one of our problems was that, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just not a whole lot of, you know, common.  I mean, we had some common experiences, but other than that, you know, intellectually and, uh, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it -- we didn't have anything to really [LAUGH], you know, bind us.  So --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, now my second marriage, I've been married three and a half years, and we're both teachers, we both, you know, have similar interests and, you know, goals in life and everything.  So, it's -- it's so much easier, so much easier.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, we've been married thirty -- I think it'll be thirty [LAUGH] -- I should remember this --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- thirty two years.
L:  Wow!  Congratulations.
R:  Thank you.  And, um [LIPSMACK], it does help.  I mean, we have different interests.  I mean, we have some that are the same and we have some that are different.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And my husband loves old cars.
L:  [MN]
R:  I mean, you know, he loves going to old car shows and stuff like that.
L:  Oh, my gosh!  We have an old car.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, do you really?  What do you have?
L:  Um, it's a Dodge Polara Convertible, sixty nine -- sixty eight.
R:  [MN] They have a sixty nine -- sixty eight Dodge Polara Convertible.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] he says.  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] He can have it.  We're trying to get rid of it.
R:  Oh, no, thank you.  [LAUGH]
L:  It runs.  It runs and every- -- come on down.  [LAUGH]
R:  No, it's not red.  Is it red?
L:  No, it's white.
R:  It's white.
L:  It's white, but that's not the original color.  I guess the original color -- we can see it -- it was like a turquoise green --
R:  Oh, ye- yeah.
L:  -- and ...
R:  Yeah.  I know all the c- colors --
L:  Oh -- oh, yeah, I guess you'd know.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- except for that color.  [LAUGH]  No, thank you.  I don't want it.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Actually I'm partial to Mustangs, but --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- he's partial to fifty seven Chevies.
L:  Oh, oh, yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  But, you know, I mean, I could take or leave old cars.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, you know, I go to the old car shows with him because it's something that he really loves --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, you know, I support him on that and he has what I call a shrine in our living room --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- of cars, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, he collects old car --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- memorabilia stuff from fifty seven Chevies and it's kind of growing in the living room I think, you know, um, something comes in overnight and puts more stuff in there when I'm not looking, but ...
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, the -- the old car gremlin.
R:  Yeah, the old car gremlin.  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  But that's okay and, I mean, he does things that I like to do and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, it -- it just kinda works out that way, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  Um, and sometimes, I mean, if I'm really not for a show he'll, you know -- I'll just say, "Just go because I know you'll enjoy it more if I'm not there".
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  So, if I -- if I'm gonna be there and you kinda dr- -- you know, dragging me around like a ball and chain --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you're not really gonna have a good time.
L:  Yeah, and you're not.  So, what's the point of two people being miserable?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  So, sometimes I go, sometimes I don't --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, he takes a camera, takes a lotta pictures.  Right now he's editing some pictures he took at a show last weekend --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and, um, having fun doing that.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  See, my husband is like a big baseball fan, huge Yankee's fan --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and I kinda knew -- and -- and I -- I mean, I can -- I can find things to be interested about in baseball, but before him -- I -- you know, I wasn't a baseball fan at all.
R:  Right.
L:  So, our first date we went and -- we -- we saw some Kevin Costner baseball movie or something like that I think it was and then, uh -- and then we saw a baseball game and then we went and saw -- you know, went to a bar and watched a baseball game on T.V. and I was interested and he made it interesting to me and I -- you know, and that's when I kinda knew wow, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I can find areas of interest in here, you know, something that I wouldn't necessarily go to on my own or be doing on my own and yet it's interesting and he makes it interesting and, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and so that was kinda like my first indication that I was like oh, I -- I think I might really like this guy [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- 'cause usually that would've been like my date from -- you know, eighty double hockey sticks, you know [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- 'cause it would've been like -- that would've been like my worst date experience ever.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] But, you know?
R:  Well, I know.  And I've learned about cars, you know, over the years, you know?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Even though I never ever dreamed I would.
L:  Right.
R:  But, you know, I know on one of our dates he took me to a drag race and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- um, you know, a drag strip?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And so I did it.  I can say I did it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But I can say uh-uh, you know?  [LAUGH]  That -- that one I didn't like.  No, I couldn't find anything interesting in that.  I -- you know?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It just kinda was ho hum.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, we didn't do that one again.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, I mean, if he wanted to go I would've have any problem with it, but it's just not something that I would wanna do.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  But, um -- but I do go to the old car shows with him --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that's fine.  You know?  So, yeah, there's just common threads and we found that we -- you know, he was never a traveler when he was growing up --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and we used to do -- my Dad -- we would go on my Dad's business trips with him.  So, you know, locally, usually in Michigan, but we got around quite a bit and so I kinda have the travel bug in me and over the years I've made a travel- traveler outta him and now he loves to travel.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  And I am.  So, um, that's -- you know, that's kinda -- you just kinda grow together, but you -- you know, you don't force it.  It's not a force type of thing.
L:  No.
R:  It's kind of, um -- you kinda dig a little bit --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- until you find what -- you know, find that area.  You try things out.
L:  Right.  Exactly.
R:  You know?
L:  Exactly.
R:  I mean, you can't say no to everything.  Like you said, you don't say no to the baseball game.
L:  Right.
R:  You go and you try it and, like you said, your husband made it interesting and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you go hm.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah, and there are times when I'm like just go to one by yourself 'cause I -- I'd rather not or I have things to do or -- you know?
R:  Right.
L:  So, yeah -- so, I -- that -- that to me -- and I think it -- it helps too when both partners have some kind of education behind them --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because then you're more able to be -- you know, I think you're more secure in yourself maybe --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and more -- able to be more open minded about their interests or, you know -- or, uh, you know, just -- I just -- I don't know -- just I think I find it really, really helps.  [LAUGH]
R:  I think it does.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I think flexibility is -- is just so important too.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Um, you know, there's some marriages people are just so bull headed.  I mean, right from the beginning they -- they just go into this whole thing bull headed, it's my way or the highway and ...
L:  Right.  You know, I'm gonna go out with the guys three days a week and that's just it, you know, or whatever?  So ...
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And it's just like ...
R:  I'm gonna play ball ten times a week or whatever --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, and they -- they don't even think about their partner --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, uh, you know, you just have to be flexible and you go okay, well, you know, I'll play two days a week and why don't you go bowling with your girlfriends, you know --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- twice a week or why don't you go golfing or, you know, why don't we both golf --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- together and something?  And, you know, um [LIPSMACK], those -- those marriages they're -- they're --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- set up for trouble before they even say I ...
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  I mean, sooner or later that's gonna come back to get ya, you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.
L:  There's no way around it.  [LAUGH]
R:  No.  Oh, definitely not.  So, what part of Connecticut are you in?
L:  Um, I'm in Stratford.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  So, you're not too far from New York?
L:  No.  No.  We're about -- you know, if you drive faster about an hour.
R:  If you drive faster.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, maybe forty five minutes [LAUGH] outside of New York.
R:  Oh, that's a nice area to be in.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Well, we're just, uh -- we're east of Detroit.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  We're in [inaudible] and, uh, used to be in Detroit.  We grew up in Detroit, but ...
L:  Oh.  I used to have a friend who was from Dearborn.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's not too far from here.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Car capital, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  But, um, anyway, your weather and stuff is basically the same as ours.
L:  Yeah.  Well, has it been very rainy where you are?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  'Cause that's all it's been doing up here.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  [LAUGH]  Yeah, we finally have strung together a few sunny days.  We had, uh, Saturday, Sunday, Monday.  We had three sun -- days of sunshine in a row.
L:  Wow!
R:  So, I think we've set a record.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, 'cause -- but we haven't had that yet.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, maybe it's coming.  We might ...
L:  We have like a half day here.  I'm -- I'm trying to -- one of these days I have to fertilize my lawn.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I have to wait for a dry period and I never get one --
R:  Oh, I know.  I know.
L:  -- and as it is it's growing.  I have a jungle outside.  [LAUGH]  So ...
R:  The last couple of nights it's -- it's rained in the evenings --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and, um, in the morning it looks like it's gonna rain.  I closed my windows yesterday and today, uh, before I left for work because it looked like it was going to rain again --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, uh, it was real cloudy and then [LIPSMACK] mid morning, you know, the sun came out.  But right now it's -- it's -- we were gonna work outside, but it's very windy out --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and, uh, it looks like it's gonna do something again.  So ...
L:  Oh, boy!  Yeah.
R:  I know.  It's just [MN].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But they're predicting a nice weekend.  I'm hoping.
L:  No, we're supposed to get rain all weekend.
R:  Oh, jeeze!
L:  So, hopefully -- I think Tuesday and Wednesday is supposed to be my day [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  -- or, you know, like two days or a day and a half.
R:  Well, we bought a bunch of perennials for our garden and we put them in in -- in the middle of May, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they were -- you know, I mean, they look healthy --
