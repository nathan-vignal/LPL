L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello, my -- my, uh, name is Garlena Retland.
R:  Hi, my name is Johnny.
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, today's topic is pets.
L:  Pets?
R:  I think so.
L:  I thought the one I got was s- sports.
R:  Oh, that was yesterday.
L:  Oh, I just got th- they just said it but I can talk about pets.
R:  Okay, yeah, I talked yesterday about sports.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, do you have any pets?
L:  Um, I -- I got fish.
R:  Fish?  
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh, what kind of fish.
L:  I've got, um, gold fish and, uh, let's see; I've got a perkusp[?] and some tropical fish.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.  But I --
R:  So --
L:  -- I -- I -- I've -- I generally like, uh, the fish 'cause there's -- there's not m- -- their stuff is contained.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I don't have to follow behind a dog to clean it up.
R:  Yeah, less maintenance.
L:  Yeah, less maintenance.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But I would -- you got pets?
R:  Um, well, I'm s- -- visiting my relatives now.  They have a cat around.
L:  Ooh. 
R:  But, um, a big old cat but used --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- to have -- have had a lot of pets.  Right now I live in an apartment --
L:  Oh, ok- --
R:  -- um, so, we can't have pets.  Although I volunteer at the Humane Society.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  So, those are kind of my pets there.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  Go down ther now and then and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- walk the dogs and that.
L:  Oh, that's cool.  So, you don't have a problem with the pooper scooper thing, huh?  [NOISE] 
R:  What's that?  No.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You mean at home?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  No.  Although I'd like to have.  But we move around a lot too though so, it's --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- hard to have -- even with fish 'cause, like, we're going to --
L:  Oh, y- -- 
R:  -- e- -- go overseas and --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- coming back and this and that so -- and it's hard, you know, you get attached to 'em and  --
L:  Right.
R:  -- then, uh --
L:  And you have to go away.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or have somebody care for 'em, huh.  [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.  Have someone take care of 'em.
L:  Right.
R:  So ... 
L:  Well, I -- I don't need cats 'cause my neighbor provides enough cats for me to -- to -- enough cats.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And they've used this -- they've used my home for a litter box for many years.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I haven't had the courage to be really vicious.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But they, uh [NOISE] --
R:  So, you don't spray 'em or anything?
L:  Oh, no.  They just -- they're the neighborhood alley cats.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE] And, uh, since I'm next door they're -- that's the closest litter box.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  In the [LAUGH] neighborhood.
R:  I know some people will spray -- you know, spray water on 'em.
L:  Oh, I usually can't catch them 'cause I've got four children --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so, I'm, you know, but I -- I have a -- actually have a bebe gun.  [NOISE] That's about as far as I could get to [LAUGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- to det- -- to anything detrimental.  [NOISE] Or to deter it I should say.
R:  So, do you ever hit 'em?
L:  Uh, sometimes.  Or just them hearing 'cause they'll hear my -- open the window and they're, like, oh, no.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  And off they go.
L:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE] I've -- I've hit one I think one time.  And it -- I know it stings so, it's one of those -- it's one of those baby -- them little kid type, uh, uh, whatever you call 'em, uh, oh, air pump things.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, one of th- -- I do it 'cause I don't want -- I -- I don't have the courage to kill it.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah a lot of people just kill 'em.
L:  No.  I can't do it 'cause see she's right next door to me.  [NOISE] 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, she -- so, she's, like, "Did you do anything to my cat?"  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Wouldn't do much for neighbour relations.
L:  No, it wouldn't.   
R:  No.
L:  Been  -- if she's -- but if she's been here, like, seventeen years so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm like [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.  I've lived in the country on and off and out thee sometimes people just -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they'll just kill 'em, you know.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Well, they kinda, you know, they -- there's so many of 'em, different --
L:  Right.
R:  -- when you're out in the -- yeah, people there just -- I guess it's different from in the urban or towns.  You know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- where people -- yeah, but I've seen -- I've seen people just killing them out there.
L:  [MN]
R:  They're -- yeah.
L:  Well, I guess this goes -- maybe they're -- [NOISE] just become a nuisance if they've got a farm or something.
R:  Yeah.  That's -- that's exactly --  it's out on the farms.  So ...
L:  And they'll get into the chickens or --
R:  Yeah.  And people -- people don't tend 'em -- get his -- get -- get 'em fixed --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- as much either.
L:  Oh.
R:  You know -- they just --
L:  Ooh, they just let 'em roam.
R:  -- let 'em breed.
L:  Right.
R:  And then they breed and breed.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you have a whole bunch of cats, and dogs too?  Dogs don't usually do that do they?
R:  Um, yeah, I don't see so many dogs out.  Although, like, at the Humane Society, we get, um, I think they get abandoned though.  Like, they got one now, a big hound dog  --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and I -- I think maybe just 'cause he got older --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I don't -- I'm not sure where he came from but, uh, you know, they -- they pick 'em like that --
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  -- and then they try to save 'em and find homes.
L:  Right.
R:  I suspect that this one, maybe 'cause he's not such a good hunter any more --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you know.  Either that or he just wandered away.
L:  Oh.
R:  But, you know, they get 'em like that and, um, pretty often.
L:  Wow!
R:  And then they, you know, they try to connect them with homes.
L:  And with families and stuff.
R:  Yeah.  So, I go down and walk 'em once a week or so.
L:  [NOISE] What's the percentage of -- of them turning around with families?
R:  Um --
L:  In your area?
R:  Well, the dogs that -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I don't know, they've got a lot of cat- -- this is actually a cat shelter and they've got, like --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- often, like, fifty cats.
L:  Whoa, Lord.
R:  And usually they just have maybe four of five dogs they rescue from the pound or get --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- the strays.
L:  Oh.  [NOISE] 
R:  And, yeah, they do pretty good.
L:  Oh.
R:  No, it de- -- it depends though.  Like they had one, who was a nice dog but really large and, um, I think 'cause he was so big, you know, it's kinda hard to walk and that 'cause he's really strong.  He was there for a long time.
L:  Oh.
R:  [MN] And they just kept him [inaudible] I think finally someone took him.
L:  Oh.
R:  But, you know, if you get your smaller ones then, like -- like they had a schnauzer in, you know, what those are?
L:  Right.
R:  They're pretty popular with -- with, um, families --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and he -- he went really quick, like, um, a lot of people were calling about him and -- 'cause he was special, you know, a special type of dog.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  You know, people are looking for.
L:  Well, do people buy -- do people snatch up cats like they do dogs?
R:  Yeah, they do certain types.  The same thing, like, they'll get siamese in there.
L:  Right.
R:  And there's whole organizations that'll then take si- -- only siamese --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so, they'll ship 'em off to the, you know --
L:  The orient or something?
R:  Yeah.  Or just different, like, collectors who then will -- I don't know what they do -- sell 'em or --
L:  They have -- 
R:  -- maybe breed 'em.
L:  Goodness.
R:  But, um, you get your --
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  -- average cat --
L:  Your average mix- mixed mutt cat, I mean, mixed --
R:  What's that?
L:  -- your average mixed mutt cat.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Th- they have a harder time 'cause there's so many.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, and, uh, well, they -- if they -- often they come in and there's so many, they'll g- -- they'll get ill and once they're ill, then it's really hard 'cause no one, you know --
L:  Nobody wants them.
R:  -- yeah.  They don't want a sick cat.
L:  Right.
R:  And so, then it's sor- --you know, downhill.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So ...
L:  Right.
R:  -- but they do, like, where you can -- you can, like, i- if you work there, like, I do, you can take 'em home --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it's like a staging ground there and I guess that actually works better because they don't tent to get sick.
L:  Oh.
R:  And then they'll just call you and tell you we've found a home --
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  -- [several inaudible words] then you pass it on.
L:  So, you end up being like a foster home or something?
R:  Yeah.  Although I can- -- I can't do that because our landlord doesn't allow pets.
L:  Right.
R:  But I'd like to do something like that where, uh, yeah, you just hold on to 'em to -- to keep 'em hopefully from getting sick.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  You know.
L:  Because they do better in a home environment?
R:  Yeah.  I think the stress too --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, especially the young ones, they come from all these different places and suddenly they're in with fifty cats and --
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  -- and there's n- n- not really people around very much --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and, um, it's like really, you know, communal living for cats.
L:  Right.
R:  So, they get, you know, they get -- a lot of them get freaked out and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, uh --
L:  And they start getting sick and stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, gee, I never even looked at it like that.
R:  Yeah.  You have a Humane Society round there, you know?
L:  We do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We actually do.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I guess [inaudible]
L:  We have, um, we, um, we also I think of it with the Humane Society we also give the nice wildlife raccoons and stuff like that. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, really.  Where do you live?
L:  I live in Colorado.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, so ...
R:  In the country?  Or ...
L:  Well, in the city but you can get -- you can get 'em I the city.  If you're up in the m- [MN] -- 
R:  Oh, you still -- still get 'em, huh?
L:  Well, you get, like, if you're up near some of the -- 'cause there's mountains here --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, uh, if you're -- get close to the mountains and stuff, you'll get the raccoons and the, uh --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you get the deer and, uh --
R:  Come wandering in, huh?
L:  -- bears and the, um, [LIPSMACK] yep.  And the mountain lions sometimes.
R:  Huh.
L:  Yep.
R:  So, what do they do with them then?
L:  Um, you know, I'm not real sure all -- what all they do.  I know sometimes we'll get a lot of reports on the news about bears.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, they will generally try to -- especially if we -- 'cause we have a drought so, they came down a lot.
R:  Oh, there's a drought now?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, well, there -- we're on water restriction actually 'cause we didn't get enough water.
R:  Oh.
L:  It's better but it's still not the greatest.  So, we -- they have us on a water restriction.
R:  Oh, just the opposite of here.  It's raining every day in Ohio --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- every day.
L:  Well, we get -- and we're getting some rain so it helps.  But it just didn't start off very well so, we've had to --
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Yeah, here it's unusually wet.  I mean, like, for farmers and that it's --
L:  It's just too much.
R:  Yeah.  Like I said, I'm visiting my mom's now and, uh, I thought it would be nicer up here 'cause I live in Southern Ohio and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it's just the same. 
L:  Oh.
R:   Ev- every day.
L:  [LAUGH] Raining every day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow!
R:  Usually that's more like April or May.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, you know, so, for the farming and that I think the weeds are probably getting really bad and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- 'cause the -- yeah it's supposed to be starting summer now.
L:  Oh, right.
R:  So, it sounds really different.
L:  Yeah, well, that's, I know, um, I believe when you have more of the mountain communities, you'll get quite a bit more of the wildlife into the, [LIPSMACK] you know, not just the cats and dogs kinda thing.
R:  Uh --
L:  You know, but I've -- I'm not real sure 'cause I don't live there.  I'm not really sure.  I just know that, like, we'll get the news reports --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- about some of the -- more so the bears and sometimes the mountain lions.  And so that --
R:  Yeah.  I lived in the mountains for a while and the, um, black bears were -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a problem cr- -- seem to be mostly created -- not that they were a problem, but because of --
