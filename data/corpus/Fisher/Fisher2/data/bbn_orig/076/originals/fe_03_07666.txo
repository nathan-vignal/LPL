R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi. [MN]
L:  Yes.
R:  Hello. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Uh, I've never done this, uh, survey before. [LAUGH]
L:  This my first time too, I guess.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Great, well, uh, I guess we sort of talk --
L:  I -- I don't have any pets, I don't know, well, you know --
R:  Oh, you don't have any pets?
L:  Yeah, I used to have a cat, but, uh, uh, because I have a problem with my, uh, allergies --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- we -- we decided to give it up, you know?
R:  Yeah.  Um, well --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I have some pets.  I have, uh, I have three dogs and they're West Highland Terriers, they're little white dogs --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they're cute.  I, um -- my -- well, they're actually my parents' dogs and I -- I'm up at school right now, but I spent a lot of time with them when I was at home.  Um, I've never had cats either because of my allergies and the dogs that we have don't shed, they -- I mean, they do a little bit, but my mom cleans a lot, so, they, uh --
L:  Oh, okay, I mean, my kids l- lov- -- li- like og -- like dogs and cats too --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, uh, they're all grown up and left the house now so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so we can have -- we could have no -- no pets at all, you know?
R:  Yeah. [SIGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, um, [LIPSMACK] let me see, one of my roommates actually just told my neighbors that she would keep one of their cats, so I'm guessing there's going to be a cat here for about a week, which will be, uh, kind of difficult, [MN] my allergies, but, you know, it doesn't -- doesn't bother me that much and I take medicine so, [SIGH] yeah, I don't know.
L:  Well, just d- -- just don't carry it around or something, you know. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, yeah --
L:  I mean -- [MN]
R:  -- she reckons if I just don't play with it, but it's so cute, it's, like, a little kitten, it's kind of hard to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ignore. [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  You live in apartment or you in a house?
R:  I live in a, um -- [LIPSMACK] it's a townhouse, so it's not a house, but it's bigger than most apartments around here. [SIGH] 
L:  Uh, do you own it or you rent it?
R:  I rent it.
L:  So, do you allow -- allowed to have pets there?
R:  No. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  W- --
L:  So, you're in trouble now then?
R:  Well, they -- our neighbors have had this cat most of the year and they deal with it, I mean, I -- they deal with it well, I guess, I --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I don't think they've had any problems with it [MN] and the landlords really haven't noticed.  Cats are a lot less noticeable of a pet than dogs are, I think --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, it's probably be in, like a -- an apartment situation.  But we're only going to have the cat here for a week, so it's not -- hopefully, I mean I -- we don't even see our landlords very often, they come by, maybe --
L:  Oh, okay, all right, yeah.
R:  -- like, once every three months so I'd imagine it's not going to be a big deal at all.  And she's responsible, so she'll --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- take care of it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah. [SIGH] But, I, um -- let's see -- when I was -- with my dogs at home, I would take them on walks, but they, uh -- because they're so little they don't walk very far --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- and [LAUGH] they're just like -- they're like -- they're like, you know, six inches long and, uh, my mom pretty much took care of feeding them and giving them water and that sort of thing, although I would do that when they were out of town --
L:  Yeah, that's another problem with having -- having pets is that you've got to have -- got -- leaving all that stuff too, you know, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, that's one of the things, like, some of the people here in college who have pets, I feel like they --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- shouldn't [MN] --
L:  You are -- you're going to school?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I feel like they don't take care of them enough. [LAUGH] Don't, like --
L:  Mhm, yeah, okay.
R:  -- don't walk the big dogs or, you know, don't clean often enough to have, like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a house that's not smelly from their animals. [MN] But that's why I never got a -- a pet up here.  I wanted to get a house --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that had anim- -- that would let you have animals, but I realized it wouldn't really be a great decision, I'd always be worried about leaving my door open --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or somebody else, because I always happen to have lots of roommates and people around --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so that would be really worrisome. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I'm --
L:  So, this is the first time -- this is the first time you also getting contacted by them?
R:  Oh, the, um -- I actually --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- called in, so once --
L:  [MN].
R:  -- you -- if you call in, they'll call around to get somebody else to answer.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, I've been --
L:  I know that I --
R:  -- called before, but I wasn't home.
L:  -- I never had my PIN, I don't -- I don't think I got my PIN.
R:  Oh, they didn't give it to you?
L:  No.
R:  Did you sign up online?
L:  Online, yeah. 
R:  I think that it'll be online if you look.
L:  Oh, may- maybe it [inaudible] there.
R:  I think you can get it emailed to you.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Maybe I --
R:  So --
L:  -- should del- -- maybe I missed the email or something, you know?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  But they -- the email did say that I'll be getting a PIN, that way I can call when I -- when it's convenient for me, you know?
R:  Yeah, they sent me an email.
L:  [MN] Mhm, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  So, um --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- did you ever have any other pet, other than this cat, or ...?
L:  Well, we had a dog, we had a, uh, b- before --
R:  What kind of dog was it?
L:  -- a long time ago. I- i- it was a -- what was it now?  [NOISE] Gee, I don't remember, a small dog, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- Cocker Spaniel maybe, I don't know, some sort of mixed breed of Cocker Spaniel. This was actually when I was overseas, you know.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And so, when we moved to the States, uh, there was all kinds of quarantine and all that for the dog, so I wouldn't even bring him over --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- because I -- I didn't want to go through putting him in the quarantine for so many months and all that, you know.
R:  Yeah, they -- that's understandable. [NOISE]
L:  But they're pretty strict, you know, about bringing a- animals over, you know, pets over.
R:  Yeah.  So, was he hard to deal with at all, did you, like, have any problems --
L:  Oh no, he was fine over there, yeah, you know, like, my the kids loved it and, you know -- but, you know, we were in a place where there was enough room, you know, outside and all that, so there was no problem, you know?
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  So --
L:  The other problem was --
R:  -- did, um --
L:  -- is that, you know, and I -- we do a lot of travelling too and if you have a  pet, you can't --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- travel sometimes, you know?
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Like, I have friends of mine, you know, when they went abroad, they had -- they had to get a cat sitter, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I know.
L:  Which is a [inaudible].
R:  Yeah --
L:  I guess- -- 
R:  -- my mom --
L:  -- I guess it's all right when you are sitting someone else's cat, I guess.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It was a nuisance, you know.
R:  Yeah, they -- I mean, and they are kind of like a kid. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Can't really -- although cats you can leave home, maybe for, like, a few days, if you give them sufficient food --
L:  Well, we used go -- like, our cat, we used to leave them -- leave him for three or four days --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and we'll -- we'll leave enough food for him and the cat litter, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then somebody would just come by a couple of days to check up, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, they were --
R:  So --
L:  -- like, full of them, yeah.
R:  -- is it expensive to have an animal, like, the -- the shots and vets or have -- have your animals been pretty healthy.
L:  Oh yeah, well that's fine, yeah, you know, wasn't too -- too bad a problem, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, I mean, they'll -- they will check for the shots and all that anyway -- check up on everything, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] But, uh, it wasn't too bad, you know.  They -- the expense --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- was the food, of course, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, he -- he wasn't used to the food, uh, he didn't like the cheap food, you know, he liked the good food --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, so --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- and, of course, my kid always spoiled him, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  Your kids, you say?
L:  Yeah, there's four of them, you know?
R:  [MN] Did they take care -- take turns at taking care of him or ...?
L:  Oh, yes, they -- they took care of the cat, there was no problem, yeah.
R:  Yeah, that's good.
L:  But, I mean, you know, it's all -- it's -- uh, we had a cat, like, uh, many years, you know -- almost like, maybe ten years, you know?  [MN] And then, uh, after --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they left we decided --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to give it up, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I was having a lot of my asthma problem, you know?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And then I had to also change all my carpets --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and burn the carpets and everything.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] So, you didn't anticipate it being as bad as it ended up being?
L:  No.  I mean, when we -- when we got the cat, I knew that there was going to be a problem, but -- but I had to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- sort of weigh that against, uh, my kids pleasure, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because they really liked the cat, you know?  So ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  My doctor kept telling me to give it up, but, you know, I --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I didn't want to do that, you know?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah, well, that's nice of you. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  My, um -- [NOISE] my sister also has guinea pigs, have you met anybody who had guinea pigs for pets?
L:  No.
R:  [NOISE] They're like -- do you know what they are?
L:  Yeah.
R:  They are -- they're kind of little rodent looking things --
L:  That's right, yeah.
R:  -- but they're really nice, they're -- they're actually very catlike [NOISE] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in that -- but they -- I mean, they don't really run around the house or anything, you have to keep 'em in the cage, but they just sit on your lap and they're really soft.  They're --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- very hard on your allergies, [NOISE] 'cause they sh --
L:  Well, I had -- actually we had --
R:  -- they shed a lot.
L:  -- we had some fish --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- at one time, you know, also.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Like, a little small aquarium --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  -- of fish, yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, somehow s- some day the fish died too, so -- [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah, [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] I've had fish before, I'd like [NOISE] to get [SIGH] sometime when I move into a stabler atmosphere [NOISE] I'd like to get [NOISE] saltwater fish --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but they're so hard to take care of [NOISE] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, like, monitoring the foul content of the water and the temperature [SIGH] and, you have to, like, filter the algae content so that it doesn't [NOISE] smother them [NOISE].
L:  Yeah.
R:  It looks really tough. [LAUGH] But I've had goldfish before.  I'd one that actually lived for, like, five years, [NOISE] but, um, [NOISE] --
L:  What I'd love is actually the parrot, you know?
R:  What's that?
L:  [MN] A parrot.
R:  Oh, you got a parrot?
L:  I would like to get one, you know.
R:  Oh.
L:  The one that talks, that would be nice.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, they're fun.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I've never seen --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I don't think I've ever seen one in a person's house, but, the pet store where we would go to when I was a kid, where we'd go and I'd look at the fish and look --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- at the hamsters and things like that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] they had a parrot that was really old, like fifty years old --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it talked away all the time, it was really weird to be around.
L:  Yeah.  Well, we went to Florida once and there's a big parrot jungle over there.  A whole --
R:  Oh, yeah, in Miami?
L:  -- a whole -- yeah, exactly, yeah, so --
R:  Did you go in it?
L:  Yeah, we went there, yeah.  In fact we were there the week that, uh, there was a big hurricane -- I don't know if you remember what, you know, it was like --
R:  Yeah, I -- and the birds got out?
L:  -- e- -- the whole thing was just --
