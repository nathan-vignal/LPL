L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Deborah in California.
R:  Hello, my name is Deanna and I'm from Staten Island, New York.
L:  Oh, hello.
R:  How are you?
L:  I'm good.
R:  Yeah.  [COUGH]
L:  Well, do you have any pets?
R:  Um, I have -- right now I'm living on my own and I don't have any pets, but at home I do have a dog and her name is Buffy and I love her a lot.
L:  Oh, what kind of dog?
R:  Um, she's just a little mutt, but she's been with my family through a long -- for a long, long time now.  So ...
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, we have, uh, three cats, all different ages.  One is mine and he's been in the family -- well, she -- for eleven years and then my oldest daughter then got a cat.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  She got a Persian and --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- then my youngest daughter who just turned seven she's gotta kitten about a year ago.  So --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- all the girls have cats.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then we have, uh, three turtles --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- and, uh, some fish.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, we kinda keep pretty busy with pets around here.  We're -- the oldest turtle he's getting pretty big and so we're gonna be building a pond in the back yard for him.
R:  Really?  Wow!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  What a lucky turtle!  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, it's kinda funny how we ended up him.  Um [LIPSMACK], we were away for a week and we got home and my parents, uh, who live about a half hour away called and said they had found a turtle swimming in their pool [LAUGH] and nobody round in their neighborhood had staked claim to him.
R:  Wow!
L:  So, we don't know where he came from.
R:  That's strange.
L:  So [LAUGH], we inherited him somehow.
R:  Mhm.
L:  The girls didn't -- you know, they said, "Oh, we want him.  We want him" --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so he's stuck with us and he's gotten bigger and he's too big for the -- he's a water turtle --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he's too big for the fish tank we have now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so, we're having to build him a pond.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, he's gonna be one lucky, lucky turtle!
L:  [LAUGH] Well, my husband likes fish and he's been wanting a -- a coy pond anyway.
R:  Mm.
L:  So ...
R:  Very good.  We, um, had turtles -- we had one turtle when we were little.  We found it on the side of the road and it got really big too.  Like we had it in a fish tank and it was too big, but it was very difficult to -- to take care of because it smelled so bad --
L:  Mm.  It will.  Yeah.
R:  -- if you didn't clean --
L:  You have to ...
R:  -- the tank all the time.
L:  They're very messy.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Very messy.  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so, my husband he's -- he's the one that takes care of that, but ...
R:  Have you been able to bond with the turtles or ...?
L:  Um, well, when he was in the tank he would know when I would be there and he'd come over and he would actually eat his pellets out of my hand --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and -- but since he's been outside he's a -- yeah, he's only been outside for about a week now and he's I think still not used to it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I don't know how it'll be in the wintertime.  Winters are pretty mild here and they're supposed to hibernate.
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  So, I'm not quite sure how the wintertime's going to work for him, but --
R:  Maybe by the tree.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- we'll have to see [LAUGH] and then the other turtles they're -- they're teeny tiny ones.
R:  Are they?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like the size of your palm or something, like they're that little or ...?
L:  They're -- they're -- they're about a silver dollar, half dollar.
R:  Okay.
L:  Whichever one's bigger.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  They're about that size.  So, they're inside in the big fish tank and they're just the cutest little things and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they'll -- they -- they started eating out of my daughter's hand --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and so ...
R:  Yeah, I like little turtles.  Big turtles it's very hard to keep their ...
L:  Yeah.  It's just like sometimes with kittens I wish they would stay little.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  That's very true.
L:  They're really cute right now.
R:  That's why I like having my dog.  She's very little.  So, she doesn't -- she's doesn't get that -- well, she's older now and she still hasn't gotten that big.  So ...
L:  Yeah.  Well, my -- our one cat, the Persian, we just had her shaved not too long ago 'cause she's long haired and it gets kinda matted a little bit and it surprises me when she's shaved how small she really is.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But she's really little.  She's really cute.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And she comes up and says goodnight every night up on the bed --
R:  Does she?
L:  -- and purrs and then -- then she leaves.
R:  [LAUGH] How cute.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Cats have their own personality.
L:  They do.
R:  We've had quite a few cats and this one cat of ours was beautiful.  It was like very fluffy and furry and it had like this reddish color, um, fur and all my friends wanted to touch it and I was like, "Don't touch that cat.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You touch that cat you're asking for it".  But then other cats, like other people's cats, they just curl up in your lap and they love the attention.  They have their disposition that's for sure.
L:  Oh, they definitely do.
R:  Mhm.
L:  None of ours are actually lap cats.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But our old -- our old cat she's big and fat.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  She's huge [LAUGH] and she -- well, when we first got her from the pound she was itty bitty --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but she cried and cried and I think she just started to overeat.  I think she was starving --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and even when we'd limit the food she'd just cry and cry and ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, she's just has always been big --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- after that and she -- she comes around.  She really likes my husband --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so she'll be a lap cat for him, but ...
R:  That's interesting.  My Dad hates cats.  He -- he got rid of all our cats.  [LAUGH]
L:  My Dad was kind of like that too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  He had been out on a farm and, you know, just cats, you know, in his garden and he didn't like 'em digging around.  But my Mom ended up with a cat and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it just is an indoor cat.
R:  Yeah.  We, um -- we wanted some kind of animal so we got this kitten from our friends and we told our daughter it was male so it wouldn't have any babies and [LAUGH] then it ended up getting pregnant like three times --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  "-- and my Dad was just like, "What did you do to me?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Now, I have like millions of cats and I have to get rid of them".  Mhm.  But he just -- he just does not like cats at all.
L:  Yeah.  Well, my Dad despite what he says he plays with the cats and --
R:  Mhm.  My Dad wouldn't.
L:  -- he has fun with them too.  So ...
R:  We used to put it on my Dad just to tease him.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But the dog is like a [COUGH] -- a member of our family.  Like our family's gone through a lot and the dog has always been there and everyone knows that the dog is -- is their best friend, so a very, very beautiful pet to have in our family.
L:  Yeah.  I had a dog when I was -- when I was young and -- and I -- it was a little Sheltie --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- Shetland Sheep Dog.  It's like a miniature Collie.
R:  Mm.
L:  But she was very high strung and -- and the girls would probably like a dog, but they have to be reminded about taking care of their cats.  So --
R:  I bet.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [LAUGH] so we said no.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Dogs are even more responsibility.  So, they're gonna have to wait --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- 'til they're out on their own.
R:  Very true.  I've been living in the city for a while now and I keep seeing these small, small dogs and I want one so bad.  There's like these new breed that just stay really tiny, no more than like a -- probably like a foot and a half long --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they don't get any bigger and I'm like oh, I want that dog so bad.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause our dog is getting very old now.
L:  Yeah.  Well, maybe you'll end up with one soon.
R:  Mhm.  Is your cat -- is she doing all right?  Like a dog can't see and --
L:  She's --
R:  -- doesn't hear very well now.
L:  -- she's okay.  She -- I -- I think she has arthritis --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, she doesn't move very well --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so it could be a combination of that, plus her -- her weight.
R:  Right.
L:  But she's still -- she -- she still jumps up on the bed and on the couch --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and she'll go outside.  She doesn't leave the back yard --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and our middle cat doesn't leave the back yard either, but the youngest one he's our only boy cat --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and even though he's been fixed he -- he wanders and [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but so far he does fine and comes back and ...  But, um ...
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  Our dog -- you -- like you wouldn't know it, like we didn't know it either until we left it at someone else's house because my Dad was going away for a vacation and I guess at their house it was -- like Buffy was running into everything 'cause at our house she has a really keen sense of where everything is --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- 'cause she can't see that well anymore.
L:  Right.
R:  But she's memorized where everything in the house is so she doesn't run into anything.  But at someone else's house she was bumping into --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh.
R:  -- all the furniture and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- very confused.  So ...
L:  Sure.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's hard.
R:  Yeah.  She's a good dog though.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Likes her -- she used to like to chase after rabbits.  Our neighbors had outdoor rabbits.
L:  Mm.
R:  She was just [inaudible] and take off and chase that thing all over the yard and we brought her out on trips with us too like to New York.  Oh!  It was more trouble than it's worth, but ...  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, so far the cats have left the turtle in the back yard alone.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We +weren't quite sure how that would go either, but when we were cleaning it -- the pond isn't in the ground yet, it's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just the form and it's above ground at the moment and ...
R:  Okay.  Mm.
L:  So, we've just dumped the water out to clean it and put the turtle on the grass and they try to stalk it while it's crawling around out there.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I bet they're like what is this thing?
L:  And, um -- 'cause he -- he gets -- he gets moving pretty fast across the back yard.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um -- but when he's in the pond they pretty much --
