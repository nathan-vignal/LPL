R:  Hi, I'm Teresa from New Jersey.
L:  I'm Nancy from Illinois.  [PAUSE]  Hello?
R:  Hi.  [LAUGH]  I'm still here.
L:  Oh, okay.  Um ...
R:  I have one dog.  He's a German Shepherd.  Actually two.  There's a German Shepherd and a -- oh, God!  What is he?  He's like a Lab.  She's like a Lab, you know, a Lab mix.
L:  Yeah.  Um, I don't have any pets right now because the apartment I'm living in doesn't allow pets.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I -- actually I have a couple of cats, but I keep them at my Mom's now.
R:  Oh, oh, I love cats.  I used to have one.  I -- I had to give her away because, uh, my -- she was having a bad reaction with -- with my bab- -- with my baby.
L:  Oh.
R:  But I love cats.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I do too.  I -- I wish I could a -- a pet here, but they don't allow 'em.  So --
R:  I know.  Oh.
L:  -- I had to get rid of mine.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
L:  Yeah, it's kinda hard.  I don't get to spend as much time with him as I want to, but every time I go to my Mom's they're there.
R:  [LAUGH] So, uh, what -- what kinds are they?
L:  Uh, just mixed breeds but, um ...
R:  Oh, yeah.  Um, do you happen to, uh -- let me see.  Um, what do they look like?  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, one of them is black and white, um, we call her Dipstick because --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- her tail is all white except for a black ring around the tip --
R:  Oh, that must be cute.
L:  -- and -- and the other one, um, he's kinda hard to describe.  He's really beautiful.  Um, he's orange, white, black, a little gray, a little of this and that really, he's all different kinds of colors.
R:  Oh, I used to have a -- a Manx cat and I loved her so much.  She had like a little -- oh, almost like a puffball tail.  But she was eighteen years and, you know, she passed away.  But, um [LIPSMACK], you know, um, I have a friend who's got like four or five of 'em.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  I wish I could have one right here, but both of the dogs would go crazy and it'd be too stressful, you know?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  My husband wants a dog, but I don't know.  He likes dogs and I like cats and I guess we're just gonna have to try to find --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- some place that allows 'em and, uh --
R:  I know.
L:  -- try to work something out.
R:  Yeah.  Right.  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  Um, are you R.M.C.'er or ...?
L:  Do what?
R:  Like, um, are -- are you like with Refunding Makes Cents or ...?  I -- I mean, is that how you found out about the study?  That's how I did.  [LAUGH]
L:  How I found out about the study?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, actually one of my friends found it somewhere online and sent me the link to it and I signed up that way.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Friends.  I know.  I -- I have a friend that -- that told me about it too.
L:  Yeah.  I've -- actually this is probably only the third or fourth one of these I've done, but they call all the time.  But ...
R:  Oh, really?  I've never done this one before.  That's interesting.
L:  Yeah.  They call all the time, but sometimes I will be on -- on the phone for about ten or fifteen minutes and they still won't find anyone else for me to talk to and I just can't sit and wait for that long, you know?  So ...
R:  Oh, I know.  I know.  [LAUGH]  I know.  I -- I -- I'm always doing something and I've got a sixteen month old.  So, it's like, you know --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- right now's perfect 'cause she's asleep but, you know --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- during the day it's a little bit rough, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  She'll be running all over and next thing you know, "No, get off of that", you know?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Close call, you just saved her from something.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Gosh, I -- I bet that is hard.
R:  But I always wanted to make sure she was raised with animals because, you know, it's important.  I mean, I, uh -- I don't want her to be afraid of 'em, either dogs or cats, and she -- she seems to like both of them.  But I have to keep telling her, "Nice doggy", you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  You don't hit him.  [MN]  But she's not allergic to cats either.  I know she isn't.
L:  Oh, that's good then.
R:  Yeah, w- which is something that really makes me relieved 'cause I'm -- I'm really a cat person.  So [LAUGH], you know?
L:  Yeah.  Surprisingly I actually am allergic to cats.
R:  Really?
L:  So, not having them here is kind of a blessing, you know?  When I had them I always had allergy pills everywhere because sometimes it -- they don't bother me, but if they get up in my face and Dipstick she likes to lick my eyelids.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't -- I don't know why she does that [LAUGH], but she likes to lick my eyes and when she does that they just puff right up.
R:  Yeah.  I used to have a cat that, um -- well -- well, uh, he was named -- his name was Fritters and he used to like lay on my head and just go to sleep there and he used to make me so -- like, in the morning, I mean, I would -- I would have such a hard time waking up because it just was so comfortable, you know?
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  But somebody actually told me, "Oh, be careful, you know, the cat will steal the baby's breath" and I'm saying, "My God!  Where did you hear that rubbish from?"
L:  Yeah, I hear that all the time and [MN] ...
R:  I mean, come on.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, they -- they might wanna sleep on your chest, but that's because, you know, they -- they like your warmth or something.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, it's just crazy.
L:  Yeah, I've heard that before too and I just -- [LAUGH] I'm like, you know, cats are not evil.  They don't go around saying, you know, "I'm gonna steal this baby's breath and kill it".  Yeah, I just -- I don't know where that came from.  But I've heard that before too.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, gosh, my throat's getting all dry here.  It's a good thing I've got iced tea.  So, how's the weather out there?
L:  Uh, really, really muggy.
R:  Yeah, here it's -- it's wet and it's kinda damp and it's -- it's been really bad.  I mean, we've had so much rain it's been terrible.
L:  Yeah, we go in spurts really.  We have a week where it does nothing but rain and then the next week it's hot and humid and all the -- I guess all the rain's evaporating and it just -- it gets so damp and then I think we're about -- about ready for another bout of rain again.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, it's better -- I'll take anything over the snow we had this -- this past winter.  That was terrible.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, we had so much of it.  Oh, gosh!  You know?  I mean, I don't mind it, you know?  I -- I -- I was thinking about moving to Tampa, but I don't think I could take ninety five degree heat like for four months outta the year.  I mean, that's a lot.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess.
R:  They were serious too about that.  They were really telling me, "No, we're not kidding.  It really gets that hot", you know?
L:  Oh, wow!  Yeah, it gets about -- like that here.
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah, we get a lotta rain in the spring and then in the summer it just pretty much all dries out.  Like last year we had so much rain that we were something like seven inches above average and then it didn't rain all summer.  So, the lakes would go way up above where they usually are and then in the summer it would just -- it all dried out and then went really, really low.
R:  Yeah.  Um, last year we were -- I mean, the situation that our state was in was, uh -- it was like we -- well, we couldn't even, uh, fill our pools.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  They -- they were telling us it was a drought and now forget it, you know?  You can use as much water as you want.  You can leave the faucets going all day, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  Wow!  Yeah, and I've -- I've read about, um -- about over there on the east coast about how they had something like a two year drought --
R:  Oh, yeah, we did.
L:  -- where some states didn't get any rain at all really.
R:  And that's when they started going after the people that were wasting water.  We -- it was really surprising to find out like there were certain restaurants that were really bad and, um, New York got a whole bunch of violations too.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  Yeah, 'cause I'm -- I'm right near New York City too.
L:  Oh, wow!  That's neat.
R:  Yeah.  Are you near Chicago or ...?
L:  No, I'm in Southern Illinois.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  All the way down at the other end.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, Chicago's about six hours away.
R:  Oh, boy!  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, a lotta people are ...
R:  I know I'm starting to wish I was a little farther away from New York too [LAUGH] like ...
L:  Yeah, a lotta people are surprised to learn that we're that far away.  Um, we live right off of, um -- off of the interstate and one of my friends works the night shift at one of the gas stations right off there and I'll go in there and talk to him and then people will come in and say, "How far are we from Chicago?" and when we tell them they're like, "Oh, but we're already in Illinois, aren't we?" and they just -- they don't seem to understand just how -- how long our state is.
R:  Wow!  Yeah.  I -- you know, I -- I mean, I don't think you can really go six hours here.  I mean, I think it'd be three from like top to bottom, but maybe I'm wrong and it depends upon all the, uh, traffic you're gonna get.  But, uh, I mean, um, it's -- it's kind of unusual when you really think how -- how long, you know, the state is, you know?  Like from this -- from -- from like yours to like mine and stuff 'cause I've been to like Texas and forget it, you know, you could drive for like two weeks in that place [LAUGH], you know?  Are you still there?  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Oh -- oh, okay.  I -- I thought you, uh, went away.  I -- I hear a click.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, no.  It could be my phone.  Sometimes my signal gets weak and it cuts out.
R:  I wonder if my mother's trying to get online.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  I'm on her phone because I can't find mine.  Oh, God!  But --
