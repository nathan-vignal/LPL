L:  [SIGH] Derien.
R:  Hi, my name is Mike.
L:  Hi, Mike.  [NOISE]
R:  What was your name again?
L:  Derien.
R:  You spell that for me?
L:  D.E.R.I.E.N.  [NOISE]
R:  Where ya live?
L:  In Ohio.
R:  In Ohio.
L:  [MN] Uh-huh.
R:  Okay, great.
L:  Where are you from?
R:  I'm in Kansas City.
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  Couple of Midwest folks here.
L:  Wow.
R:  This is a tough topic actually.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] like --
L:  Yes, when they said life partner, I'm like, "Do they mean ? "
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "What do they mean?"  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh --
R:  Yeah, today's society --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it's definitely a --
L:  [MN] Yeah, what do they mean [inaudible] [LAUGH] --
R:  I know it happens but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- huh, it doesn't happen --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- very often.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, [SIGH] --
R:  I guess the perfect question would be, "Are you married?"
L:  No, are you?
R:  I am.
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  Yep.
L:  That's nice.
R:  Eight years.
L:  Eight long years or --
R:  Eight [SIGH] -- 
L:  -- or just eight years?
R:  Eight years last month.
L:  Eight long years or eight years?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Both.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's a good one.  [SIGH] I like to --
R:  Yeah, they are good --
L:  I like to do that one.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I hope you don't mind that I've just fixed myself a snack and I will try not to be munching in your ear but I'm like [MN] --
R:  Hey, that's fine.
L:  I've been gone all day.  Okay, life partner. Um --
R:  Most important thing.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I -- I assume they mean, well, anyth- anyb- -- I -- when I hear life partner, I think of homosexuals.  But they must mean anybody.
R:  They must mean anybody.
L:  Yeah, what's the -- I don't know if there is just one important thing, you know.
R:  Yeah, that's a tough --
L:  There is so much --
R:  -- this -- this is a tough one.
L:  There is so much though --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Um, and when you're talking nowadays, for instance, 'cause it's like I don't know what age group you're from.  You sound pretty young but --
R:  I'm thirty two.
L:  [SIGH] So, um, yeah, so [MN] many years ago it would have been like, "Okay, you've got your husband, provider, dah, dah, dah, dah " but now these days women are making -- making the same type of money in some situations --
R:  No kidding --
L:  -- and --
R:  -- yeah.
L:  -- and they're providing, yeah.  And so --
R:  That's great.
L:  Yeah, heck, I'm sure.  It takes a l- -- you know.  Men have had it +rough for a lot of years, many generations, you know, gives -- gives them a chance to sit back, you know.  But when you talk about the importance of a life partner, I guess it's someone who has values the same as yourself.
R:  Yeah, that -- I think that definitely helps in a long term relationship.
L:  Yep, um, um, I don't know that your outlook.  I wouldn't want to be totally alike my pers- -- the person I'm with 'cause, you know [SIGH] -- you know if you're just alike, you know.
R:  Yeah, you definitely want some --
L:  That can be boring.
R:  -- some conflict there occasionally.
L:  Sure.
R:  Productive conflict.
L:  Keeps the heart pumping.
R:  That's right.
L:  [MN] [MN] [MN] That's what I say.
R:  The -- th- -- I -- I mean, it's part of that.  It's just the flexibility too, to -- to look at something from a different point --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- of view I think.
L:  Ex- exactly, I -- I agree totally.  But I think compatib- compatibility would be a big part of everything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And some people probably look at the wrong -- wrong aspects when they're looking for someone then when you get -- like I do, is watch some of these pathetic divorce shows and everything and it's like, "Well, how can you be only married for a few months --"
R:  No kidding.
L:  "-- and decide it's over?"
R:  That's right.
L:  Or anybody, you know, or how about, "You're a good woman.  I wanna live together for a --" and they -- then in a month's time they actually marry and the marriage lasts for like a year or less.
R:  Isn't that weird?
L:  That is strange.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I -- that one I don't get at all.  And it's like there can't be too many surprises so --
R:  I -- I'm like -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  I think that, uh, you know I liked to look for somebody who was optimistic.
L:  [NOISE] Mm.
R:  'Cause you wouldn't wanna be with somebody who was pessimistic, you -- you know?
L:  Yeah, yeah, that's true.
R:  Optimism is --
L:  Me --
R:  -- a good thing.  Humour is a good thing.
L:  Oh, definitely h- humour.  You have to have and in these days I think it's tougher and tougher to find an ideal situation because we're busier.  Everything is go, go, go.
R:  Yes, most definitely.
L:  You know what I'm saying?  And then --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- you don't have time to sit and relax and, y- you know, just -- you know, sw- swinging on the front porch and stuff like that.  Forget it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Who c- -- who can do that now?
R:  It's tough.
L:  You know.  So it's -- I don't know.  I -- I would think, um, [MN] compatibility, strength.  It takes strength on both partner's side.
R:  That's for sure.  Most definitely.
L:  And nowadays a lot of people are getting hitched.  There could be bl- blending a families.  That's something to consider 'cause --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- not that, you know -- it's -- it's, uh, I'd be more likely to find someone, I think if you're single, you're more likely to find someone who has children than who does not have --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- kids, you know?
R:  Seems more common nowadays.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You probably need, you know, a similar way to raise your children too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And a similar point of view in terms of finance and --
L:  Sure, you know.
R:  -- that kind of stuff too, so 
L:  Y- sure.
R:  There's probably a fine line there between enough similarities or compatibility with just a little spice of something different.
L:  Sure, definitely.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Definitely.  So this was- -- this was your first marriage then?  
R:  Yep.
L:  The one you're right now?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, cool.  Never been married.
R:  You've never been married?
L:  Nope.
R:  How about that?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Huh, you didn't say how old you were so I'm gonna ask --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- anyhow.
L:  I am forty.
R:  Okay.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Just never up to -- he never came up?
L:  I guess -- I don't know, when I was much younger this guy kinda wanted to marry me but we talked about it but, yeah, I really didn't like him like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I didn't think.  I -- I figured he'd get on my nerves.
R:  Well, good for you for not --
L:  And --
R:  -- getting married anyhow.
L:  Yeah, and --
R:  And just doing it.
L:  Though [MN] [MN] th- there are times when I wish that I had gone on and maybe af- after I got older and 'cause I -- I'm just -- my nerves just aren't that great.  I can't take a lot of st- aggravation.  And if there's something about you, you get on my nerves.  Well, we had rekindled our friendship many years later but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- he has since then died.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, I was kinda glad, you know, in a way.  But he always -- he had health problems and was always concerned about me and my daughter.  And "How you doing?" and "Is there an- --" you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know like that.
R:  Sure.
L:  But, um, as for actually -- no, I can't.  Well, one guy used to every other minute, "You wanna get married.  Let's get married".
R:  No kidding.
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, my kid said, "Well, he's a little too immature for that."
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  With this man, he's gotten -- he has gotten married since th- we were together and then -- he -- th- he's divorced now but --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- just, [MN] you know what -- just what he was telling me.  That was no union.  I'm like wh -- --
R:  Yeah, really.
L:  "Who were you thinking?" You know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  "Why were you putting up with that?" you know.  [MN]
R:  No kidding.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Huh.
L:  Guys are weird.
R:  No kidding.
L:  I think so.
R:  We sure are.
L:  [LAUGH] I think you guys are strange.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]
R:  There's no doubt about it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  But --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know, a lot -- there's a lot of strange women out there as well.
L:  Yeah, probably.  Might be one or two.  I don't know.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know any so  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] It's a select group outside --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- of the Ohio area.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yes, yes.
R:  Only.
L:  Right over the border.
R:  That's right.
L:  So how long have you been doing this?
R:  I just did it yester- -- this is my second call.  Yesterday was the first call.
L:  My first call was the other day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [several inaudible words] all these people I'm like, "And I can't believe you called.  And I can't believe I got another one."
R:  Yeah.
L:  So 
R:  I initiated this one so 
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, I figured --
L:  Oh.
R:  "What the heck.  I'll just go ahead and get it in there.  I've got a few minutes here I'll --
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, uh, see, it's hard for me because, [MN] you know, like I'm here and I'm so scared everytime I'm not home, "Did the phone ring?  The phone ring?" "No" and so luckily I'm here.
R:  How about that?
L:  And I'm scared.  And I know.  And I'm like -- I don't know.  I've gotta maybe switch that or something.  So 
R:  Yeah, you definitely -- if -- when you initiate, you know, you have a better opportunity --
L:  Oh, you can just initiate any time?
R:  Yeah, you just call the number and then g- -- then you put your pin number in.
L:  How often can you do that though?
R:  Gosh, I hope I can do it once a day.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Hope I didn't mess it up by doing it again today.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 'Cause I really don't wanna talk to ten --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- for ten minutes about --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- different topics like every, you know.
L:  Even told my told my kid, I think.
R:  And not get paid for it.
L:  I know.  I told my daughter if you have to just, "What do we have to talk about?"  I says, "Whatever they tell you.  You're a college student.  Come on.  Suck it up"
R:  Oh, yeah, definitely.
L:  [MN] [MN] You know.
R:  Make something up, huh.
L:  I'm [inaudible].  But, um, let's see.  Life partners.
R:  They have a list of topics on the web page so 
L:  Did they?  Oh.
R:  I guess we should talk about life topics a little bit more.  Eight minutes --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- of the ten have to be about life.
L:  Yeah, the life partner.
R:  Life partner.
L:  Yeah, I would say, um, someone who's fun, compatible, um, yeah, I think you need to try to -- try to be as compatible as you can in a lot of areas.  Some areas don't come up until after marriage.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I would say, but, um, definitely the typ- -- same types of views or, um, mindsets, religious backgrounds sometimes is always a plus, if you can do that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I don't know.  [MN]
R:  The religion thing gets us a little bit.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because we're -- we're not the same faith so 
L:  Oh, [NOISE] that -- that hap- -- that can be.
R:  That definitely makes it tou- -- +tough.  That's a good point I think.
L:  But you just don't --
R:  To have that.
L:  -- know.  Have you find -- you've been -- you've been married eight years, you say?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Have you found yourself changing in some ways though?  Because I think that as we grow -- grow old and grow as people that our views change and so --
R:  Oh, definitely.
L:  -- I would imagine that over the years some things about yourself that were there the first time would change, you know?
R:  Oh, definitely.  Yeah, definitely.
L:  And I'm wondering how do people handle that?
R:  I'm almost [MN] [MN] [MN] --
L:  You know what I'm trying to say?
R:  Yeah.  Oh, definitely.  I think, yeah, that's -- that's why I was saying about the adaptability or the flexibility of the person that you're with.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because there's gonna be change.  And how that person accepts that change.
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's the thing.
R:  It is a big thing.
L:  And if you're mind never --
R:  'Cause it depends -- depends on how radical the change is too.
L:  Yeah, that's true, that's true.  But if you're -- I think in time -- in some ways, as time goes on.  The more you read, the more you learn, you just start your world v- -- your -- your view changes and so gotta be with somebody whose view might change --
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  -- with it, maybe or like you just said if it's a radical change in behavior you're gonna be like, "What --
