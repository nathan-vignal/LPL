R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  I'm Susan.
L:  Hi, Susan.  This is Bonnie.  How are you?
R:  Hi, Bonnie.  I'm good.  How 'bout yourself?
L:  Great.  Have you done these surveys before?
R:  One time.
L:  Great.  So have I and, uh, I, uh -- let me see.  The topic is what do we find the most important in a life partner, is that correct?
R:  Right.
L:  Okay.  Are you married?
R:  Uh, I actually am separating.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  And do you have a- another, uh, significant other?
R:  Well, no.  No, I am not -- no.  How 'bout yourself?
L:  Oh, I'm married, uh, going on twenty eight years.
R:  God bless you.
L:  [LAUGH] Been together thirty three.
R:  Wow!
L:  Yeah, high school sweethearts.
R:  Wow!  So -- so what do you find the most important thing?
L:  I think the most important thing I find is open communication.
R:  Mm.
L:  Uh, you can't have trust without communication.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  You can't understand what the other person is feeling, whether it's good, bad, uh, frustrated, unless you have communication.
R:  Right.
L:  And I'm not saying our marriage has been perfect but, you know, during those rough times when my husband becomes crabby and honorary I -- I have to ask, "What is with you?  What is wrong?" --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and he'll say, "Never mind" and "nothing" and I'll say, "No, I can't stand it when you're crabby and honorary, you take it out on me and I have to know why" and that's how we open it up.  But, um, also it's the way you communicate.  Open communication doesn't just mean communicating and yelling at each other.
R:  Right.  Sure.  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, open communication is saying, "This is how I feel because" in a very, um -- I don't know -- sensitive way.
R:  Right.
L:  You can be angry, but --
R:  Respectful.
L:  -- respectful.
R:  Not attacking.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yes, not insulting.
L:  And, yeah, we do, uh, get a little, uh, defensive and such.  But, you know, later on it's kind of when you have your cool down periods you just say, "I -- I was just angry and didn't mean to be so, you know, abrupt" or whatever.  But I guess -- I -- I guess that's what I feel is most important.  Yep.
R:  I -- I think -- yeah, I think that's a great one.
L:  What do you feel?
R:  Well, yeah, it's hard to come up with the one.  Uh, I think yours is tremendous and -- and I'll select a different one, although I'm not sure I wouldn't say that as well.  But, uh, maybe for me trust --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and knowing that you're dealing honestly with one another.  Um, to me it -- it doesn't matter what other qualities of personhood your partner has if you can't trust what they say, um, it -- the relationship's gonna erode, uh, that's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that's my belief.  If you don't know that what they say is what they mean it's like, um -- and I have to say that I was blessed in my relationship that -- that trust was not an issue.  So, that was something that we did have and I -- I think that's essential.  I can't imagine being involved with someone over time that I did not feel was being honest with me and who I was being honest with.  But, um, you know, and that way if -- you know that if a mistake is made or something or like that it's just that, it's a mistake, or I forgot something, but not that I didn't wanna tell you 'cause I thought you'd be upset, or I didn't wanna tell you because there was even a worse agenda than that, or lying directly or manipulating in that way.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, that feels like a -- a really, really core one to me.
L:  And not to get too personal but, um, what do you think, you know, you're separating -- what do you think would've been the core to keeping, uh, um, a successful relationship?
R:  Uh, oh, that feels so tender for me right now.
L:  Yeah.  Since you said trust wasn't the issue ...
R:  I'd rather -- I'd rather talk in more general terms if that's okay --
L:  Oh, sure.
R:  -- 'cause that feels -- that feels -- that feels very tender.  But I'm certainly willing to talk on the point in a -- in a more general way.
L:  Yeah.  Not, um, anything, you know, real personal, but like in general, like since there it wasn't trust was it, uh, an issue of oh, maybe a financial disagreement or -- or some- ...?
R:  No.  No.  I think -- I think there -- there's certain ways that -- I guess one of -- one of the things that strikes me is what's important in a relationship is that you also grow together --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- and there may be ways in which you both grow, but you may not grow together or that the ways you see things or what becomes important to you in terms of your values may shift and that may be the time to -- to end the relationship, um, that -- that there may be ...  Is what I'm saying making sense to you?
L:  Oh, absolutely because I feel the same way.  Like I said, we've been together since high school.  We had the same goals, the same ideals and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the same dreams too.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, okay, we wanna do this and we wanna have a family and when we have grandchildren we wanna build a big house and we wanna do this and -- and all of a sudden it's kinda like midlife and his, uh, road down, uh, the path turned.  I'm still headed on our dreams since we, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- made them --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I'm going what happened to what we planned?
R:  Right.
L:  Or what happened to -- now you're changing the whole picture.
R:  Right.
L:  And I'll -- I'll say that's my biggest frustration in my life partnership is ...
R:  Isn't that interesting?
L:  You're right.  Um, I -- you know, he goes, "Well, you know, life happens, things change" and I go, "But shouldn't we have discussed that you wanted to change the plans?"
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Because I was one that gave up my education to, um --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I -- I quit college to finish helping him through college.
R:  Right.
L:  I worked two fulltime jobs to help him finish college, get his degrees, and "Oh, don't worry.  I'm gonna be the bread winner.  Um, you can go back to school if you want, but you don't have to get a job".  All this and then all of a sudden he decided to change his career and all of a sudden it's you have to go find a job.  We need the money.
R:  Oh, that's rough.
L:  All right.  Yeah.  And all I've done are, um -- for the past, uh, ten years is find jobs just to supplement the income.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Nothing I enjoy.  Nothing I wanna do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, some of them have been horrendously, uh, stressful, that I hated.
R:  Right.
L:  But the stress put on me in the partnership is we have to have that money.  You have to keep this job.
R:  Yeah, and that's where I can see where your thing about communication because that -- that feels -- that feels to me like there is a way in which you made, um -- you really made an agreement, almost a contract with one another and if he's shifting a contract that's -- that's a hard thing to do unilaterally.  I mean, that -- that's ...
L:  Exactly.  It's a lifetime partnership --
R:  Right.
L:  -- agreement.
R:  Yeah --
L:  He ...
R:  -- because you made certain choices based on what he said -- what his promises were.  That's tricky.
L:  And if they were gonna change it should've been a joint --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- decision.
R:  Yeah.  I understand that and that's -- that's exactly the kinda thing I'm talking about.  Yeah.  [MN]  That's rough.
L:  See, that's why I say communication.  We should've talked about this.  We should've said, you know, "Oh, gosh, you know, I wanna make a career change, um, and it may include you have to change your -- your career as a homemaker and part time worker and, you know, whatever", um ...
R:  Right.  Or -- or given you the opportunity to set yourself up in a way so that --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- if you were working it was at something that you loved.
L:  "Okay.  So, if I have to, um -- you know, if I have to help in the income I want to go back to school and finish my career and --"
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- do something I love --
R:  Right.
L:  "-- always wanted to do and gave up in the first place for you".
R:  Yes.  Yes.
L:  And now it's just -- you know, I wasn't given the time to prepare, like you said, and it's because we really didn't talk about it.  "It was just like well, too bad.  I -- I didn't realize I wasn't gonna make as much in this new career as -- as anticipated".  So, it wasn't a joint decision, it was kinda like well, you have to do this and I thought wait a minute, we're life partners.  I'm not your employee.  You're not my boss.
R:  Right.
L:  And I have said that to him and I said, "Don't treat me like one of your employees".
R:  So, do you think like something extra might help you in terms of with the communication?  Have you thought of counseling or something like that where you'd be on a more equal footing and you'd have a third party who was not vested in an outcome, who might help you sort through this?
L:  Fortunately we haven't reached that point.  Um, we still communicate and I've told him, "I'm disappointed and I'm -- and I'm frustrated that this has happened and if you're gonna be frustrated with me that I can't find a job then, you know, I was thrown into this position.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you're gonna have to show some, you know --"
