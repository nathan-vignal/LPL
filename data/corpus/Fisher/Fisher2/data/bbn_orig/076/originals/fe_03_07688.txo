R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  I'm Paul.
L:  I'm Merle.
R:  Hi, Merle, how are you?  Or --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what part of the country are you in?
L:  Uh, w- mid west --
R:  Oh, I'm from --
L:  -- Illinois.
R:  -- I'm from Minneapolis myself.
L:  Oh, uh-huh.
R:  Well, oh, God, I just -- this is the first time I've done this and I already forgot the question.
L:  It's a -- we're to talk about, uh, life partner and what -- what is the most important thing, uh, when looking for a partner.  
R:  Like --
L:  Is the way that I understood the topic.
R:  Well, I guess it would have to be, uh, so you both get along with one another.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, I don't know.  What do you think?
L:  Well.  [LAUGH] That would probably be pretty important I would think.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, uh, trust -- trust.  Trusting the other person, uh, would be pretty important to me and, uh --
R:  Probably have to like one another.
L:  Have to like each other.  [LAUGH]
R:  That helps.
L:  It would help, yes.  Are you married?
R:  Yes I am.  I'm married and I have two children.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And --
L:  I'm --
R:  -- yourself?
L:  I'm married.  Uh, we're senior citizens so --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- we're kinda been around the block, uh, [MN] a while but, uh, [LIPSMACK] you know, we do pretty good [inaudible].
R:  Well, that's good.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's kinda a hard topic to continue on.
L:  Ooh, well it is.  
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I, er, uh [MN] isn't that --
R:  I don't know what else --
L:  -- the way you understood the topic?
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  That th- they --
R:  I just --
L:  -- they wanted to know the most important thing that you look for when choosing a partner.  I think it's the way I understood it.
R:  I think you have --
L:  Um 
R:  You have to be attracted to one another to a certain extent.  I guess that I would say that that's probably a -- a initial factor that's probably, I would say that even before you gain too, uh --
L:  To get the person --
R:  To get to know them --
L:  You --
R:  -- probably have to have --
L:  There has to be that --
R:  -- some sort of physical attraction.
L:  -- that spark there to b- start things off, right.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, uh, the most important thing I -- I don't know.  It's kinda hard to just, uh, [MN] come up with, uh, most important.  I -- I -- I don't know.  What would you say?  What do you think the m- the first thing you would think of?
R:  I guess if I was just on the initial -- I would [MN] -- I would have to be physically attracted, initially.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then I'd have -- then after that, um --
L:  That kinda seems right because if you don't have that then you don't go any further, do you?
R:  You don't have anything else, exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Now this, um -- that might sound shallow or something but I think that's probably the way it is in most instances.
L:  Mhm.  Whether they admit or not.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Mhm.  I think you're probably right.  Well, uh [MN] at least, uh, they're getting kinda a viewpoint from a male not a female here aren't they?  [SIGH] Uh 
R:  I think some people don't like to hear that.  The -- what I just said but I think in most instances, that's the way it is.
L:  I think, yeah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I g- -- I would have to kinda agree with you there, I think.  And then after that then you kind of delve deeper and, uh --
R:  Work on --
L:  -- look for the other things.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] Jeez.
L:  Well --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- let's see.  [LAUGH] Where do we go from here?  [LAUGH]
R:  We've talked all of three minutes.  And, uh --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I think we've covered all the bases.  I don't even know how this whole program really works.  It's the first --
L:  Well, it --
R:  -- time I've ever called.
L:  I- i- yeah.  How did you find out about it?
R:  Through the Internet.
L:  I've found out through the Angie site.  I don't know if you know it.
R:  I know what that is.
L:  Pardon?
R:  I do know what that is.
L:  Oh, do ya?
R:  Yes.
L:  Well, anyway that's how I got into this and my first one was yesterday --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it -- it was kinda fun.  And it was, uh, um, another subject but I guess we do this three times and -- and then that's it, er, I think.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, this is my second call.
R:  Mm.
L:  And I called in.  I -- yesterday I was called and -- but today I called in.  Did -- did you?
R:  I, uh .--
L:  Or did you wait for a call?
R:  They called me.
L:  Okay.  [LIPSMACK] Well, let's see.  Is there anything else we can talk about on this -- this subject?
R:  [SIGH] What else could we talk about, um ?  [SIGH] You know, there's -- th- there's the new thing coming along.  The -- the alternative lifestyles which is kind of a controversial issue.  You know, the gay and lesbian thing.  Um, I think that's, uh -- that's still hard for me to swallow.  Maybe I'm too old fashioned for, ah, those types of things but, uh, I guess even in those instances, when those people -- when, uh -- when those type of relationships evolve they need to, uh -- I guess they basically are looking for the same thing in their categories.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um --
L:  I would imagine [LIPSMACK] if, uh, you can kind of think of what you would want for your children wh- when they get old enough to marry, what they -- what you would like for them to look for in a -- in someone to spend a lifetime with.  What, i- if you can kinda think of it that way too.  What would you ?
R:  For my children?
L:  What --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- would you think would be the most important --
R:  So, they're --
L:  -- thing --
R:  -- happy, you know.
L:  To be happy, right.  
R:  I -- I think --
L:  To find someone that they could, um, be happy with.  Mhm.
R:  I -- I would really n- [MN] [SIGH] prefer not to be.  You know, I'd r- r- r- would like to support my kids in anything that they plan to do as much as I possibly can.  You know, I -- even if I -- even if I have to bite my tongue as to what I think about it, I'm gonna try to give 'em as much support as I can and try to steer 'em as best I can about, you know, that, uh -- that type of thing.
L:  Mhm.  But even though it, uh -- they would choose someone that you wouldn't approve of for some reason or other, if -- if you felt that this --
R:  I guess at that point it's not my decision to make on whether or not I approve it.  The only thing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I can do at that point is to make sure that -- that, uh, my child is happy and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- make sure that what he's doing is the right thing.  I can't make the decision on whether or not he's gonna make the right thing.  I can only, you know, try to clarify the issue for him.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- make sure that, uh, he knows what he's getting into and, you know, that sort of thing and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.
L:  Have a discussion about it and then let them hopefully you -- y- you -- they -- they choose someone that they can --
R:  They can be happy.
L:  -- live for a lifetime with, mhm.
R:  'Cause I -- I think about, uh, me growing up, you know, with -- when I met my wife in college, my parents had no -- they had no say in the matter.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, they, you know --
L:  Or didn't -- it didn't want to.
R:  And they didn't -- they didn't pry.  
L:  Right.
R:  They were happy for me --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know --
L:  But they --
R:  And maybe that was a reflection on the fact that they were happy with who I selected.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, uh --
L:  But they --
R:  -- they saw that I was happy and --
L:  That was it.
R:  -- they knew at that point there was no, uh --
L:  No --
R:  -- there was no reason for them to meddle in my --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- personal, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  So 
L:  Well, it -- it -- that's nice when it happens that way.  It doesn't always for everybody --
R:  Oh yeah, I know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I was gonna say I was pretty fortunate in that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- category.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So 
L:  Well, I guess when it comes down to it, it pretty much has to be their -- their decision.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Okay, I think, uh -- I think they just, uh, wh- when -- when the time is up they just come in and -- and tell you so I -- I think we've talked --
R:  It's coming up on ten minutes.
L:  Mhm.  Well --
R:  I think we started at twenty seven past the hour and now it's thirty five minutes past the hour so 
L:  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK] Mm-kay.  Well, at least you're watching the clock.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, so what about you when you were growing up and you dated your husband?
L:  Well, I, um -- I dated quite a bit and I -- I remember there were several that -- that I really [MN] [MN] one person in particular that I really liked but I know my mother [LIPSMACK] objected and, uh --
R:  On the basis of what?
L:  Well, uh, I was pretty much into music --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and this person was a -- a basketball coach.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And so this was totally not what she had envisioned --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- for my life, and, uh, so she let her opinion be known and -- and it did, you know, affect me too because I wanted -- I always wanted to, you know, please them and everything so --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- it did kinda affect the outcome [LAUGH] but, uh, anyway, um, it's -- I -- I figured it's better when everybody goes along and -- and thinks it's the right decision.  But anyway that, uh -- that does happen when -- when a parent doesn't approve of the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- intended.
R:  Well, I think we're about finished here.
L:  Okay, well, uh, let's see.  We're [MN] -- the- they'll come on and then you have to give a comment I think afterwards.
R:  Okay.
L:  Okay.  [LIPSMACK] Well, this is -- this is different isn't it?
R:  Yes.
L:  [LAUGH] I've never done anything like this before.
R:  Me neither.  I just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- thought I'd give it a -- a try.
L:  Mhm.  Well, how is the weather up in Minneapolis?
R:  It's very nice.
L:  Is it?
R:  One of the few days that are --
