L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, my name's Cathy.
R:  Hi, my name's Emily.
L:  Hi, there.
R:  Hi.  So, I guess our topic is pets.
L:  Yeah.  Do you have one?
R:  Yeah.  Well, technically I guess -- my roommate has two cats.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, how 'bout you?
L:  I have three cats and two dogs and actually it's -- they're all family pets.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, my goodness.  What are their names?
L:  [SIGH] The two dogs are Fergus and Friar.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  The cats are Best, Thistle and Halley, short of Halloween.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, that's cute.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Is it -- is he a black cat?
L:  Um, no, actually she is orange and black and white, and we -- she actually showed up -- all of our pets are rescues --
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  -- and she showed up, uh, in our back yard in October --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and so when it became obvious that she had no place to go and she was pretty sick looking and -- and [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- thinner we just took her in and -- and named her Halloween.
R:  [LAUGH] That's cute.  I like that.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, my roommate has, um -- I live -- my roommate and I have lived together for about a year and we've had the two cats.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They're technically -- they're hers.  She's the one that takes care of 'em.  Uh, Clyde and Salem, they're two boy cats --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and they're -- they're both rescues too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, yeah, they're -- I don't know -- they're -- they definitely have the run of the household.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, our cats have the run of the household.  Unfortunately it's a little bit difficult to stop that.
R:  Yes, I know.
L:  But, um, the dogs are -- they -- they pretty -- actually they are currently mostly confined to one room in the house because --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I have a nine month old and it's more for their safety, you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Because she is -- she is fearless when it comes to them and my older dog --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- Fergus is about [SIGH] five or six.
R:  Okay.
L:  No -- yeah, he's -- well, he's five because we got him the year we were married.  So, um, Fergus is five and he -- she can crawl all over him, pull his ears, pull his mouth, his face, um, and no big deal.  But Friar is real skittish --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and she's a total bean brain and I never know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- what she's gonna do.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I -- I mean our animals are all members of the family but [LAUGH], you know --
R:  Yeah.  No.  Yeah, I understand.
L:  -- they are terribly -- they are terribly confined at the moment because it's just -- it's just safer for them.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Right.  Well ...
L:  Safer for everyone involved.
R:  That's fine.
L:  But, no, I can't imagine -- I -- I cannot imagine living without my animals.
R:  Oh, I know.  I know.  I mean, I -- yeah, that was -- I was thrilled when I found out my roommate had cats.  [LAUGH]
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, 'cause I've always -- when I moved out, um -- I moved out from my parents' house to finish college and, um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I -- I've always had pets, always had dogs and cats and everything else --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I lived -- I lived by myself in this little studio apartment for a little while and I had nothing.  I didn't even have a fish.  It was horrible.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, yeah --
L:  So sad.
R:  -- yeah, but she had cats and everything and I love them like they're my own.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, they're definitely part of the family.  How -- what kinda dogs do you have?
L:  Well, Fergus is a black German Shepherd and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- Friar is total mutt.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  She's totally a mutt.
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, we have seen --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- elements of Chow, Hound, Lab --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, or some sort of retriever 'cause she has the web paws --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, Dob- -- just -- she is just such a mutt.
R:  Oh, my goodness!
L:  Um, when we first -- she was actually -- she's actually our last addition and what I told my husband when I was pregnant with my youngest --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I looked at him and said, "You keep saying you wanna get another dog.  If you're gonna get another dog it's now --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- because I am not gonna be waddling around the house trying to train a puppy".  [LAUGH]
R:  That's funny.
L:  So -- so we get -- we get a dog --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and we ended up Friar, um, who is just -- like I said, just the worst bean brain.  Uh, my vet always laughs because I'll go in with --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- Friar stories and he just laughs.  [LAUGH]
R:  That's funny.
L:  I said, "Why do I get the neurotic animals?"
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Well, uh, that ...
L:  And he said, "Because someone else out there would send them back to the pound" --
R:  Yes, that's true.
L:  -- and I said, "Oh, yeah.  You're right".  [LAUGH]
R:  That's true.
L:  "You're right".
R:  So ...
L:  But, no, they are definitely members of our family.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, the -- my oldest cat is eighteen and she has the run of the house and she is --
R:  Oh, my goodness!
L:  -- still, um -- she is still the queen --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- as far as -- I mean, she's old and she's got cataracts and, I mean, it's gonna be any time --
R:  Mhm.  [MN]
L:  -- now that she's gonna go because she's eighteen years old, but --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's old.
L:  -- uh, but she's still -- she completely totally carries herself with grace and dignity and even when --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- my nine month old is attempting to pet the kitty, which generally means --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  -- poke her fur, she just looks at her like must you?  [LAUGH]
R:  That's funny.  Yeah, we have our, um -- our cats, Clyde and Salem.  Clyde is -- he's the regal one.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  He's the one that just -- the must you and then Salem he's -- oh, he's -- he's a total klutz, always knocking stuff over --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and tripping over things and oh, he's just -- he's -- we -- he adopted a potholder.  He stole a potholder from our kitchen.  It's like a ...
L:  A potholder?
R:  A potholder.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It has a, um -- it's like -- it's like a towel, like it's in the -- and he just shredded it, just -- he's adopted it and he carries it around the house in his mouth like a taco and he -- oh, my God!  We had to name it 'cause he's adopted it.  We call it Penny the potholder --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and he plays -- oh, it's so funny to see this cat just like trotting down the hall with a potholder.  [LAUGH]
L:  He has a woobie.[?]  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.
L:  Your cat has a woobie!
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, it's -- it -- I've never known a cat to -- I mean, why a potholder?  It's -- it's like a terry cloth towel, like why he didn't ...
L:  That's really strange.
R:  Yeah.  Why he didn't pick up a washrag or something else?  But, no, it was the potholder.
L:  A potholder.
R:  Yes.
L:  This is [inaudible] the potholder.
R:  Yes, the potholder and, yeah, he's [MN] -- it's -- it's hilarious.  I can't even imagine.  I was, um -- I've never been -- I've -- [SIGH] when I was younger we -- I mean, I was -- I always favored dogs and things like that --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- until now I've lived with the cats and they just -- oh, so much personality.  It's unbelievable.
L:  Oh, tons of personality.  Tons.  I mean, the dogs have personality too --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and actually I have -- I've had ferrets.  I've had horses.  I've had --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- rodents.  I've had lizards.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  I mean, throughout the course of my life.  But, um, the only thing that I can tell you has as much personality as a cat is a horse.
R:  Really?
L:  Oh, God, yes.
R:  I never would've guessed.
L:  My horse -- my horse and I had such a wonderful relationship.  She actually gave me away at our wedding.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, you're kid- -- oh, my gosh!
L:  No.  She --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- I rode her in.  We had -- after our wedding I rode her in 'cause I told -- I told my husband, I said, "You know what?  She's been with me as long as anybody else has.  She has either approved or disapproved of every guy I've ever gone out with --"
R:  [LAUGH] Wow!
L:  "-- and you are the first one she has given her unconditional approval to" and interestingly enough my cat -- my oldest cat did the same thing.
R:  Mhm.  Wow!
L:  Um, she had either approved or disapproved of every man I've ever dated --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and she claimed Tony.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  As soon as -- as soon as she met him she -- he was her person.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, that's so nice.
L:  [LAUGH] He -- he was her person.
R:  Oh, that's -- that's a nice story.  I like that.  [LAUGH]  Your horse gave you away.  That would make for some interesting wedding pictures.
L:  It did.  It made some --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- actually lovely wedding pictures.  [LAUGH]
R:  That's good.  That's really neat.  Wow!  So, do you still have the horse?
L:  No, she passed away.
R:  Oh.
L:  Uh, well, actually she came down with Cushings and by the time we had diagnosed it because --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's not something that's common in horses, um -- but the time we dia- -- had diagnosed it she was too far gone and we ended up --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- having to put her down.  But that was about three years ago.
R:  Mm.
L:  Actually a little bit more than three years ago and I still have wonderful memories and wonderful pictures.  She is --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or was -- was one of my best friends and, I mean, like I said I cannot imagine living without animals.
R:  Oh, yeah, they're [SIGH] -- you know?  I mean, they -- they really do -- when you come home from a hard day just petting them -- just petting them, having them greet you at the door --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- which the cats do, the cats greet you -- they're --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- cats greet at the door.
L:  Yeah.
R:  People think I'm crazy when I say that, but they do.
L:  No, they don't -- they do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  In fact, they go so far -- like I said, um, my husband is my cat's person --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and when we were first living together he and I had a fight and he didn't come home until like some ungodly hour of the morning --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and she [LAUGH] -- well, she met him at the door --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- looked at him, turned her back on him and walked away --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- flicking her tail, like excuse me, where have you been all night?
R:  That's funny.
L:  It was hilarious and she -- she followed him and she waited by the door of the bedroom until he came in.  She turned around, jumped up on his side of the bed and I had woken up for god knows whatever reason --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I watched this whole thing.  She jumped up on his side of the bed and if she could've tapped her foot she would have --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I thought to myself I don't have to say a word.  My cat just chastised you.  That was hilarious.
R:  [LAUGH] That is.  That's really funny.  Wow!
L:  But they just -- but the personality is just amazing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's amazing the personality they have.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, for example, yours stealing a potholder.
R:  Yes.  No apparent -- for no apparent reason and, yeah, I don't know.  He -- and ice -- ice on the linoleum floor that is -- oh --
L:  Oh, that's fun.
R:  -- oh, they -- that ...
L:  Grocery bags.
R:  Ye- yes.  Oh, that's ...
L:  Empty grocery bags.
R:  Yes.  A- any empty box anywhere.
L:  Yep.
R:  Yes.  Either ...
L:  Generally you will find a cat sitting in it.
R:  Yes.  Yes.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  My roommate and I we, um -- you know, 'cause, uh, we're both students and we both work fulltime so we're outta the house a lot --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and the cats, you know, have each other.  They have more toys than most small children.
L:  Children.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah, and the furniture in our home is arranged for maximum feline comfort.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Like we have a bay window in our front house.
L:  Yes.
R:  They -- they like to sit in the window, but they didn't like to sit in between the couch and the window, like the back of the couch and the window.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, we had to move the couch out --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so that they could sit [LAUGH] in the little windowsill.  Yeah.
L:  Oh, you guys got it bad.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, you should --
