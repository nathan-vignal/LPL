R:  Clarissa -- 
L:  [inaudible].
R:  Hello?
L:  [inaudible].
R:  Hello?  
L:  [inaudible].
R:  This is Clarissa.  I can't -- you're breaking up pretty bad and I can't --
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  Oh, haha.
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  Um, I can't -- I can't under- I'm sorry.  You're breaking up real bad and I can't understand you.
L:  [several inaudible words].  Shoot.  Well, wait, let me see if I can get better reception somewhere.  Hold on.  
R:  Okay.  
L:  Is it better now?
R:  Yes, it's better.  I can hear you now.
L:  Oh, okay.  So I'm just gonna park here, then [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  So we're supposed to talk about, what?
R:  About pets.  Do you have a pet?
L:  Oh, pets?  You know what?  No, I don't have a pet, and I would love to have a pet.  I used to have --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  I used to have a cockatoo when I was younger, then I had --
R:  Oh, really?  
L:  Yes.  It was so cute, and I had um -- I had fish tanks since I was about uh thirteen, I think.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But um, yeah [several inaudible words] you know, I'm -- I'm in a situation now where a dog would be really nice, but uh, you know, it's the [inaudible] thing [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, yes.  I understand.
L:  Yeah.  Do you have pets?
R:  We have one dog.  
L:  Oh, what sort of dog is it?
R:  We -- it's a [inaudible].  
L:  Oh, I don't know that kind of dog.  What does it look like?
R:  It's um kind of a gold color and it's pretty tall.
L:  Okay.  
R:  And --
L:  Is it -- 
R:  It's -- it's used for a drug dog.  Actually, it's -- my husband's a police officer and they use -- they -- they're trying to train it to be a drug dog.
L:  Oh, wow.  That must be really interesting.  I -- I [inaudible].
R:  It is.  It --
L:  I'm a big fan of the animal kennel and I have watched, like, Animal Precinct on Saturdays and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, um [inaudible] zoo or whatever they call it in the mornings [LAUGH].
R:  Uh-huh.  Oh, yeah.
L:  I watch and it's, like, "Oh, not another animal" and there'll be [inaudible].  [LAUGH].
R:  I -- I love animals, but we're -- we're not home very much so I kinda feel like I'd be neglecting one if I had too many.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Especially if I had an indoor pet.
L:  Well, you know what I think?  I think that um just like with [several inaudible words] is -- is me and my boyfriend, if we were to get a dog, we might stop with just one dog and, you know, get used to it, but I am pretty sure that actually we would probably get a second dog to accompany the first.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I would, too.
L:  Yeah.  It's just a question, you know, if you have two dogs, if they're gonna get along well or are they going to completely tear up the house, you know?  [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  Yeah.  But -- so.
L:  Mm.
R:  Been training 'em and uh -- it -- they're fine.  I love 'em, and they're good companions and most dogs --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- are very faithful.
L:  Yeah, they are.  Is this -- is this your first dog or --
R:  No.  We've had several throughout our marriage.  Um, we actually had another drug dog and --
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  -- my husband was a canine handler and she -- we had her till she passed away.
L:  Oh, oh.
R:  She was just the -- she was just the best pet.
L:  It was getting old?
R:  Yeah, she was old.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Oh.
R:  She was very old.
L:  Oh.
R:  She was about fourteen years old.  
L:  Wow.  That's quite old for a dog, isn't it?
R:  It is very -- it's very old for a dog.  
L:  Well, she must have been well taken care of.  So what do you think about um -- what do you think about animal testing?  I don't know if we're supposed to talk about that, but it's kinda related to pets.
R:  I -- I'm not really -- I -- I don't really agree with it.  I mean, I don't know, it's just -- it's not something that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I approve of.  Uh, I guess um some aspects of it are good, as long as it doesn't harm the animal, but the way I look at it is, if you're testing products for humans, and if you're trying to be -- and -- and if it didn't harm the animal, then why can't you test it on a human?
L:  [inaudible].
R:  You know, I don't -- I don't know.  I just don't agree with it.
L:  Mm.  Yeah.
R:  Do you?
L:  No, I -- I -- I don't.  I -- when I was younger, I used to [several inaudible words] I would go out and [several inaudible words] various [inaudible].
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I wasn't too concerned with it.  I would just, like -- but, no, I am turning more and more towards um not animal tested products.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  That's --
L:  You know, and it makes --
R:  -- probably the way I was.
L:  Yeah, you know [inaudible] little better [LAUGH].
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, you see all these, you know, poor little rabbits and mice and --
R:  Well, yeah [LAUGH].  Of course.
L:  Oh, you know.  I just feel really bad about it.  
R:  Well, yeah.  
L:  Mm.  
R:  [MN] and these animals clinics sometimes, you -- you know, um, they catch the stray dogs and the way they have to put 'em to sleep, just --
L:  Yeah, you know what the worst thing is?  When you -- um, I don't know, have you ever watched the Animal Precinct?
R:  Yes.
L:  I just think -- and it -- it really upsets me when they [inaudible] um fighting pit bulls.  Like, pit bulls that have been involved -- involved in dog fights.  Because, you know, they -- they -- when the dog has been trained to be in a fight, um, you know they can't retrain them to put them back into a family, so they -- you know, they have to uh euthanize them.  
R:  Oh, no, that --
L:  And I guess -- and I -- I just think it's so sad, you know, and I -- I -- every time --
R:  It's awful.
L:  -- I'm like, "I hope they get these people who are doing this to the poor dogs".
R:  Yeah.  Uh, chicken fights are pretty popular around my area.
L:  Oh, it is?
R:  Yes.  And that's just -- it's -- that's just as bad.
L:  Yeah.
R:  To see those poor chickens -- I don't know how they train 'em, because they're not bright animals, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, I think it's just as bad.  I mean, they're not as gruesome, I guess, as say the dog fights are.
L:  Right.
R:  Dog rights are ho- just horrible.  I mean, but chicken fights, so they -- you know, they fight them till they die, too.
L:  Right.
R:  And it's the same thing.  You can't have those as a pet at your house if -- if they're trained to be mean and fight.
L:  You know what I mean, what -- what -- what [several inaudible words] be.  I mean, obviously they don't use it as a pet.  It's more for [several inaudible words] --
R:  Right.  And especially if you've got children.  I don't know if you have any, but I have two and it -- you know those stray dog -- sometimes -- they do a lot of dog fighting around here, too, and some of these people, they get tired of the dog or whatever and they let them loose.  You know?
L:  I know --
R:  And you got a kid and it -- that dog's trained to fight and I'm out at the park with my kid or something, that -- oh.
L:  Yeah, you don't know.  That dog might -- you know [several inaudible words] other program [inaudible] um Discovery, you know, or some other um [several inaudible words] and it was um -- um report of a woman who had three pit bulls, that she specifically had trained to attack [inaudible] and there were two um brothers on their way home from school and they were waiting for the school bus and these dogs had dug a hole under the fence and they escaped out and chased these little boys, and they escaped by getting up into a tree and eventually the dogs kinda gave up and -- and went away.  So one -- the youngest kid [several inaudible words] and he got on and see if -- if the coast is clear, and he went -- you know, he jumped off on the tree and the -- all the three dogs came and physically attacked him and killed him, right there on the spot.
R:  Oh, that's awful.
L:  You know, and that -- that -- yeah, it's awful, and luckily, you know, they found who the owner was and all the dogs were um euthanized, and she -- I think she was sentenced to twelve year -- ah, twelve years in prison, but you know, that's not gonna bring the little boy back and they were interviewing --
R:  No, it's not.
L:  -- the parents and you know, she was like, "Oh, my God [several inaudible words]"  I'm just --
R:  To have your child killed that way is just --
L:  [inaudible] and they're, like, imagine [inaudible] obviously these dogs, like, they aim for your throat and they basically strangle you.  So --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- three massive dogs on top of you, and their for -- looking for your throat to -- to kill you.
R:  Oh, no.  That's -- I'd --
L:  Oh.
R:  I don't know how anybody can do that with a pet.  A pet's supposed to be something that you can cuddle with and pet on and love and, you know?
L:  Yes.  It should be part of the family.
R:  Not [several inaudible words] yes.  
L:  It should be part of the family, it should be -- I mean, I -- and I believe that all -- all pets have their own personality and I think --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- that it's -- you know, you [several inaudible words] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you should really encourage the dog to, you know, show their personality.  I mean, you can be out there and you can just see dogs and they are just [several inaudible words] so much personality in them.  You know, and then unfortunately you get some people who just don't care whether the dog has a personality or not.  They -- they just don't think it's part of the family and they just -- oh, you know --
