L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.  My name is Shayla[?].
R:  Lisa.  
L:  We had to get sports, didn't we?  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Um I don't watch it on television.  Do you?
R:  Uh, unfortunately I have to.  
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I -- I don't have to.  We have five televisions, but I usually what's on the main one and if my husband's around, it's always sports.
L:  Mm.  My husband doesn't watch much in the way of sports either, so --
R:  My husband watches sports continually.  
L:  Um, what kind of sports does he watch?  Everything?
R:  Um, yeah.  Everything.  Whatever's -- whatever's on.  Everything really.  Um, golf, baseball --
L:  My --
R:  -- soccer, football, everything.
L:  Hockey?
R:  Oh, definitely.  The only thing he's not interested in too much is basketball.
L:  I'm in the Midwest which is supposed to be a big basketball area, but I don't fit in too well with that part, so --
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Well, I'm on the West Coast and hockey is our main one.  Um, and baseball.  Of course, my husband also plays it as well as watches the Pros on T.V.
L:  You play --
R:  He plays uh baseball and uh any golf and he uh -- yeah, those two.  He doesn't play hockey, but he watches it.  And definitely -- and joins all the hockey pools that are around town.  
L:  Um does he have a favorite team?  Do you have a favorite team, since you have to watch it?
R:  Uh, in what sport?
L:  A- any?
R:  Oh.  Um --
L:  [LAUGH].  
R:  -- Detroit Redwings.  
L:  Redwings.  That's hockey?
R:  Yep.  I should -- I should be saying Canucks but that's not my favorite team.
L:  I actually root for either the Ducks or the Blues, so -- 
R:  Oh.  
L:  But I lived in Anaheim for a few years so --
R:  Oh.  Well, that makes sense.  
L:  Um -- sorry, I'm drawing a blank now.  
R:  Oh.  Are you supposed to ask all the questions?
L:  I don't think so.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.
L:  I don't know.
R:  Oh.
L:  I think we're just supposed to talk.  
R:  Oh, really?
L:  This is --
R:  For ten minutes?
L:  For ten minutes, yeah.
R:  Oh.  Are -- are you working for the company or are you just another --
L:  No.
R:  -- customer, like I am?
L:  Just another -- yeah, just another person in the study like you are.
R:  Oh.  Oh, all right, then.  Um, well let me see.  I -- you don't like sports?  
L:  I like sports.  I just don't like to watch them on television.
R:  Yeah, that's my main concern.  I like to see it -- it -- the action.  Well, not really.  I've been -- I've been to uh hockey games and baseball games and if I don't have my eyes in the exact position to see, I miss it, whereas watching it from your chesterfield, um you're -- you're much closer, for one thing, to the T.V. and you don't --
L:  Right.  
R:  -- and you don't miss as many plays.  But then I'm not, like, a guy which is avid.  They never miss anything.  Um, whether -- or whether they're at uh -- you know, the Coliseum or wherever.  
L:  Right.
R:  That's taking place.  
L:  Well, I've seen a hockey game live.  I like -- I like hockey live.  Um, can't follow the puck, but I can usually figure out where it is just by where all the action is.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I prefer it on the television actually because I can always spot my favorite stars.  My favorite uh -- I -- I play games with my husband all the time.  I'll go into the uh -- into a hockey pool, not because I care about it, but just to see if I can beat him.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And usually I do.  
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I actually won a hockey pool and got all the money and him and his friends wouldn't let me go in with them, so I kept it all and wouldn't even buy them a drink because they wouldn't let me go in -- in with them.  They're a --
L:  Well, I don't blame you.
R:  -- two way split so they wouldn't allow that so I said, "Well, you should've included the pro".  I -- I just talked it up a lot. 
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I did and I told them my favorite player was Smolenski and the first year, Smolenski was in the sports, he got a hat trick, which is three goals.
L:  Right.
R:  Well, they were just absolutely astounded.  And they said, "How did you know?" and I says, "Well, I just like the way Smolenski rolls off my tongue", so that's why --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- I picked him.  So of course, I'm driving all the fellas crazy.  'Cause it -- all I'm -- all I'm saying to them is all B.S.  
L:  Right.
R:  And I'm just doing it to get to their nerves.  Yeah.  So uh, that's --
L:  Tha- that's how I used to pick for football.
R:  It's unfortunate that they've got uh -- why would they pick sports for two ladies to talk about?  
L:  I think they just pick one topic a day and whoever they get that day, that's who they -- that's what they talk about.
R:  Oh, because uh -- uh, women don't usually care that much.  
L:  Well, I'm --
R:  Like I say, I'm kind of forced to -- well, not -- forced to watch it because I'm -- I'm here, and it's on.  I don't necessarily watch it, but I mean, I can name several players in -- in each field.
L:  Right.  
R:  You know, so I guess that means I'm kind of listening.  And I just try and make it more enjoyable for myself because my husband's watching it anyway, uh, by going into these uh pools.  Mind you, hockey's --
L:  Um --
R:  -- the only one that's -- pool I go into.  
L:  My mom started out that way with golf.  She started watching it to please my dad and then discovered that she started knowing as much about it as he did.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, even if I'm in the kitchen, I hear various names and they stick in my head.
L:  Right.  
R:  So I can carry on a conversation with, say uh, men at -- at our local pub and they think I know a lot, but I don't.  It's just the -- the names I know.  
L:  Right.
R:  I probably couldn't put a face to the name if I tried.  
L:  I -- I used to follow football a lot, but I haven't followed anything for several years now.  
R:  Yeah, well, why did you follow football?  Was it because it was on and you -- and your dad had it on or your boyfriend or --
L:  Um, a little bit because my dad watched it all the time, but some of it was just because I -- I like -- I like the action of football.  Football's never still.  They're always moving.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  I did know one lady, my girlfriend's mother, watched football devotedly and she was in her seventies and I couldn't believe it.  She'd sit there and yell and scream and she'd have a -- a great big buffet put over on Grey Cup day and she was the sweetest little woman you'd ever seen except she just turned into a nut when football came on.  So I guess she thoroughly understood the sport, but I just never --
L:  [MN].
R:  -- never got the hang of what it's all about.  I'd like them to -- in order for the women to get more interested is tell us in layman terms what the game's all about.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  You know, then maybe we'd be interested, but it's just too -- too complicated because guys think, well, it's so easy, I'm not even going to bother trying to explain it to a woman, and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so all us women just go to the game if we have to, or watch it on T.V. if we have to, but they don't take the time to explain the game enough for me to be interested in, anyway.  So how we know --
L:  Maybe that's --
R:  -- when our ten minutes are up?
L:  They'll tell us.
R:  Oh.  Okay.  Yeah, at the beginning, what was the question?  I mean, when they put you on with another woman in the -- I -- they didn't say, lady, with another person, and you are to talk about sports?  
L:  Sports, then --
R:  Is that --
L:  -- if you have any favorite teams and if you like to -- what -- what you watch on -- what you watch as sports on television, I think.  
R:  Mhm.  Well, my household watches everything.  What about yours?
L:  Oh, we -- we don't watch a whole lot right now, but I've got uh -- I've got preschoolers and under, so --
R:  Oh.  
L:  Well, a lot of uh -- a lot of men only watch playoff games.  And --
L:  Right.
R:  -- my -- my husband, in this house, we watch everything, including the playoffs.  The playoffs are a little more important than the regular season, but we watch it all.  And um there's uh -- the one thing that he doesn't watch and I don't watch is ice skating.  And that's -- that's a -- a sport that uh I guess a lot of ladies would sit down and watch, but -- but not my household.  
L:  I watch it for the Olympics.  That's about the only time I catch it.
R:  Yeah.  Well, that's --
L:  Huh.
R:  Yeah, now you're getting an idea then of -- of what your house does and what my house does.  Um, I'm -- I'm no more interested in women's golf than I am men's golf.  If they're wanting to know uh the perspective of a woman opposed to a man.  I uh -- I don't follow ladies' sports because they're ladies, uh, you know, and I watch men's sports because uh they're the -- they're -- they're the pros that are on.
L:  Right.  
R:  Yeah.  And uh --
