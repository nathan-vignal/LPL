L:  Hi, my name is Susan.
R:  Hi, my name's Alan.
L:  Hi, Alan.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  This top -- it's awkward.  It's almost like a --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, it's not a dating service or nothing but --
L:  No, it isn't.
R:  -- it just -- I know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and it's like I've never, uh, even --
L:  Are you married?
R:  No, uh, no, I'm -- I'm -- I'm --
L:  Oh, you're not married.
R:  -- fifty and I'm single, so ...
L:  Well, what do you think is important in -- in --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- for a life partner?
R:  Well, uh, just about five million things but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, yeah, [MN] -- boils down to, uh, things like trust and, uh, the big is trust but earning that trust and, uh, [LIPSMACK] care.  Care and compassion [LIPSMACK] and, uh, love.  That's -- yeah, there's my top five.
L:  There you go.
R:  What do you think?
L:  Well, I -- I'm married.
R:  Okay.
L:  And, um, I -- I had to wait a really long time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- before I found the perfect guy.
R:  Ooh, he's perfect.
L:  Oh, he's perfect.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  [LAUGH] And, um, he -- he had the qualities that -- that I'd prayed for.
R:  Really?
L:  Uh, mhm.  He --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- he accepts me as I am.
R:  Hm.
L:  Which is really high on the list.
R:  Right.
L:  Because I -- I did a lot of dating and, um, I was a different person with each one and -- and once I started slipping back into the original person, they didn't like that person.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Okay.  So I kept trying to change myself so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's really important for me to have somebody that I can feel comfortable around and --
R:  You're from the northeast?
L:  Pardon me?
R:  Are you from the northeast?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay, I'm -- I'm in Tennessee, Nashville.
L:  Oh, okay.  Um, yeah, I'm fr- [LAUGH] -- yeah, I'm from the northeast, uh, near Philadelphia.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um, and he feels the same way.  He -- he likes being here.  We not only love each other but we like each other.  We're best friends so that was another quality.  That -- that trust of having a best friend.  And, um -- oh, what else?  We do a lot of goofy things together and I needed --
R:  Well, good.
L:  -- somebody who felt as though that my silliness wasn't a turn off.  That it wasn't a negative to the relationship, that it would be viewed as a positive.
R:  Right, because, uh, it -- it --we're given innocence, uh, you know -- we don't ha- -- we're given innocence as children --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which is a -- is -- is something that some of us wanna hold onto the rest of our lives but, uh, some of us wanna be kids the rest of our lives, but [SIGH] you h- -- y- uh, for some of us, being kids, we also learn that there's irresponsible -- kids are irresponsible too.  Because, you know, they don't -- they have to learn boundaries and borders and, you know, what can you do, what can't you do, what are, you know -- what are, uh, rules and regulations and why --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you have 'em and, um, when you meet somebody you bring all that with you and it's -- I don't know if it's r- --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so much rare --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what you might have as it's, uh -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it certainly sounds like a blessing.
L:  It really is and I think you hit on it as far as it being childlike because I also needed somebody who wasn't gonna play that game.  You know, they have all these books out.  You know, how to get that man to marry you in five easy steps.
R:  Oh, God.
L:  And you have to play a game.  You have to impersonate, you know, the -- the author, basically.  And, um, he -- he didn't have a game plan whatsoever and I don't either.  My -- my big complaint was, you know, "There's, uh -- there's -- there's a whole new set of rules out here --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- for finding someone and someone forgot to give me the rule book."
R:  Right.
L:  "I don't have it."
R:  Right.
L:  You know, [LAUGH] I was so --
R:  But you know what?
L:  [MN]
R:  If you be yourself and -- well, you know what?  I mean, you gotta learn, I think, you gotta learn to just, uh, be comfortable with yourself --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because, uh, I've -- I've learned a lot about codependency myself.  I've learned a lot about recovery.  I've learned a lot about a lot of things.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And learning to live with yourself and be happy with yourself and work on yourself, you'll attract somebody eventually and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if you don't, then, you know, you can at least be friends with people or -- or put yourself out there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in the community and help people who need help.
L:  Yes.
R:  You know, and, you know, somebody will find you.  Because they'll just be like, "You're helping all these people, by the way, who -- who do you -- who -- whose -- who are you with?"  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, so there are ways rather than -- I mean, uh, rather than just sitting at home and -- and feeling like there's nobody out there.
L:  Well, I met this person at work and --
R:  Well, that's a good way.
L:  Yeah, and right from the first day, we had these little things, these little plagues, uh, are posted, em, in our cubicles.
R:  Yeah. [SIGH]
L:  And, um, [NOISE] I found Tim reading mine.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, and, uh, we have -- we from the very first day, we read the same kind of books, we knew the same authors, you know?
R:  You liked the quotes and stuff?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, they're good.
L:  Yeah.  We were like laughing and giggling on the first day.
R:  Well, good.
L:  And ap- -- and apparently, uh, three months down the road, he was telling somebody that, you know, I was going to belong to him.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "She's gonna be mine."  I didn't --
R:  Well --
L:  -- even know this conversation was going on so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- he already saw the qualities that he wanted that were --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- encompassed in me.
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah, I -- I didn't notice him until a couple of years later.  [LAUGH] As far as that --
R:  Well --
L:  -- as far as that kind of relationship is concerned.  Well, I mean, we were really like -- really good friends --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, we like the same music and books and everything.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I never considered him as necessarily a life partner.
R:  But, uh --
L:  But he saw th- that right away.
R:  If you're gonna be a life partner then, you know, there's no hurry.  If you're gonna be there in one form or fashion --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- whether you're married or not, you're -- you'll be together.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  We have, um -- we have, uh, some gay friends.  I don't know if that, you know.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  But --
R:  Oh, I have, yeah, too.
L:  -- we [LAUGH] do.  We have some gay friends and they, uh -- they're commited.  They're --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they're in that kind --
R:  Right.
L:  -- of life partner relationship.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And, you know, I -- I feel as though, even though, you know, the Bible's, you know, Romans chapter one --
R:  Oh, whatever.
L:  -- says, whatever it says.  But I -- I --
R:  It also commands us to love one another.
L:  [LAUGH] I feel as though it's my -- it's not my job --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to judge them.
R:  Judge ye not.
L:  Exactly.  I can't judge the --
R:  Who can throw the first stone. 
L:  I feel as though --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that [LAUGH] -- I feel as though that it's hard enough trying to -- trying to find somebody to love and who will love you, you know?  [MN] --
R:  Even if it's the prodigal son or whatever, it's like you -- you know, you -- i- i- i- it's -- it's unconditional love.
L:  Yes.
R:  So, and it's all my children.  All my children.  You know, if you believe in a God, then it's all my children.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you know.  [MN] We go through that in Nashville too because being the Bible belt around here, you know?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh --
L:  I know.
R:  You know, and -- and 'cause, uh, there's a lot of creative people here too with the music industry so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, [MN] when people find life partners, they just find them.  It doesn't matter what race or what gender, whatever.  'Cause at this point I -- like I sound -- I'm fifty so I've lived half a century so, you know, it's just --
L:  I'm fifty three and we just --
R:  Really?
L:  -- got married a couple of years ago.
R:  Well, good.  Well, good.
L:  And he's seventeen years my junior.
R:  You know, well --
L:  So.
R:  -- I actually a -- a soulmate, so to speak, in a -- in a girl that, uh, for twenty five years, you know.  Uh, I've just watched her --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- marry and divorce a few times and, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a lot of my best friends have married and divorced --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- a few times so, you know, we end up back friends again.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Wherever -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I've been with her, wherever she, you know, so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it just don't matter anymore.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Wonder what that was?  Hello?
L:  [NOISE] Yes, I'm right here.
R:  Oh.
L:  I was outside and a train went by.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm so sorry.
R:  That's okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's okay.  I didn't know if that was my phone or not either.
L:  No, it's not [inaudible] either phone.  [LAUGH]
R:  But anyway, I mean, you know, so, uh, [MN] you know, uh, soul mates are -- you know, are there too.  You know, I think so or, you know, if you live long enough it's like you just wonder why people are in your life for whatever re- -- even the bad ones --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean.
L:  Do you think these --
R:  [MN] I can learn from them too.  I've learnt that too.
L:  Do you think this person has those qualities that you're looking for?
R:  Right, and we enjoy being together but we're -- our -- our -- in our case, it's better that we live apart.  Because all the technical, picky little, "I like it this way.  You like it that way.  I like it up.  You like it down.  I like it cold.  You like it hot.  I like it, you know, warm.  You like it, whatever" and it don't --
L:  NOISE.
R:  -- matter.  "And that way when you're in your place, you do it your way.  When I'm in my place, do it my way or we can negotiate or blah blah blah."  You know.
L:  You know, it's so easy with my husband because --
R:  I -- I -- I kinda just like it that way because then I have my own place and my own way and then I can invite people over and when I get tired of them, I can ask them to leave, you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well --
R:  And they will.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, you'll look for that quality as well in a life partner.  Somebody that you can really compromise with and we've --
R:  [MN]
L: -- we -- it's an art form and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  We've really got it down to a science.
R:  It sounds like it.
L:  You know, we --
R:  I -- you know, I don't even know you but I'm happy for you.
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH].
R:  Well, see, you know, and, um, like I say I go to recovery meetings too.  I go to AA and things like that and you know, y- y- we're just there for whoever needs help or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- whoever's, you know, or y- y- be ha- -- you c- -- you become happy for people that -- that find some things in this life, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And since the topic's life partners, then it's like, you know, good for the people that find it because also they are examples to others that it can work.
L:  Exactly.  That's how --
R:  You know.
L:  -- we feel about ourselves, that we go --
R:  But I'm -- I'm -- I'm glad that you waited that long.  Are you -- meaning just, you know, that you don't have to rush into it.  Because I really feel that, you know, [MN] in the teens is way too early to --
