L:  Hi.  I'm Dorian.
R:  Hi, Dorian.  I'm Jeanie.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  
L:  How are you doing?
R:  Just fine, thanks.  
L:  Good.
R:  Where are you from?
L:  I'm in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
R:  Oh.  I'm in um Avondale, Pennsylvania, which is --
L:  Oh, are --
R:  -- all the way over on the east coast [LAUGH].
L:  Okay.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I was going to say, I don't think I ever heard of that.
R:  Yeah.  It's way down in the corner.  I'm just a mile and a half from Delaware, actually.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I never been over there.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, it's pretty --
L:  That's cool.
R:  -- around here.  We have a lot of good things to see.
L:  Cool.  Great.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, do you have a pet?
L:  I have two cats.
R:  Two cats?  Well, I'm not a cat lover, I'm a dog lover [LAUGH].
L:  I always -- I always loved dogs until one of the cats found me on the street and --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- ever since then I've been a cat person.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  So you have dogs?
R:  Um, we don't at the moment, no.  We have --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- always, but um we had a Miniature Schnauzer and she --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- was fifteen years old and we had to put her down.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.  So we've been about three years without a pet now and --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- um -- yeah.  So um we don't have any children in the house, though.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So um we kind of pick up and go when we want, where we want, so I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think our pets days are over [LAUGH].
L:  That sounds nice.  Yeah.  We have to take -- take these two into consideration no matter where we go.  Can't -- can't leave for more than a day without 'em and --
R:  Right.
L:  And all that.
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  I'm unemployed right now so we -- they're pretty much -- they've gotten used to having me at home and if I leave for the day and come back, they -- you know, they completely flip out.
R:  Oh, I'll bet.  I'll bet, yes.  It's -- it's amazing how they get accustomed to having you around very quickly.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, yeah.  They know our schedule and everything, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  So one wakes us up at whatever time.  He'll, you know si- sit on your chest and --
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
L:  -- his new trick is to -- whenever he wakes you up, he'll sit on your chest and stick his nose in your ear and purr really, really loud.
R:  Oh, my gosh [LAUGH].  Sounds a -- uh a little better than an alarm clock, though?
L:  Well, it is.
R:  It's a little more --
L:  It's kinda --
R:  -- gentle, yeah.
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- very gentle, very sweet, kind of --
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  -- freaky, kind of annoying.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH] right.  Now -- now, does this cat know the difference between Monday to Friday and Saturday and Sunday?
L:  Uh, no.
R:  [LAUGH].  No?
L:  No, not at all.
R:  That's the bad part [LAUGH].
L:  No, not at all.  No, he's --
R:  Oh, dear.
L:  We have one who's nine, go- almost nine, and one who's almost one.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just a kitten yet?
L:  Yeah, he's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  He's real big for his age and size, I guess, but uh --
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  -- he's -- he's definitely still a kitten.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  He's the funniest animal I've ever had.  I've had a lot of pets over the years and he's definitely the -- he definitely has a little character.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  It's -- it's funny.  We've -- we've never -- my husband wasn't brought up with cats --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I wasn't brought up with cats and neither one of us ever had any interest in owning a cat.
L:  Really?
R:  We have -- we have sat for people that had cats --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, and we just never got into them.  I -- I guess maybe the cats that we babysat for didn't have a good personality and --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  -- just didn't click with us, you know, so --
L:  Well, it really depends on, you know, how they're raised and if they --
R:  Right.
L:  If they know you well and all that, and I -- the cats I've known over the years have had such a huge range of personalities, it's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- really --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- incredible that a little animal can have -- can uh think so much --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and --
R:  Yes.  
L:  -- and be so individual. 
R:  Mhm.  Yep.  Yep, I know.  We find the same thing with dogs and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um my kids both have dogs, so we're --
L:  Cool.
R:  -- still uh exposed [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  My uh --
R:  Two kids, different ones.
L:  My -- my parents have a dog.  I think she's going on, like, twelve years old.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And she's, you know, she's getting there in age and they treat her like a princess.
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  And both me and my sister are, you know -- my sister's back from college for the summer and -- and the dog is just, you know, the center of their entire world.
R:  Yep.
L:  They carry her outside to go to the bathroom and --
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  -- my mom cooks for her.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  She has to have a low sodium diet and --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- that dog is their baby.
R:  Oh.  Well, we were very lucky.  Our dog was very, very healthy --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- up until the end and I never had to do anything special for her.  She --
L:  That's good.
R:  -- she was just, you know, always -- always there and -- and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- always there healthy.  She had five litters of puppies.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yes.  We bred her.
L:  Oh.
R:  And um -- and she was a good mother and you know, had beautiful puppies and --
L:  Was she pure bred?
R:  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Oh.
R:  She was a K.C. registered.  Mhm.
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  Yeah, and she was very, very tiny, so she was actually the runt of her litter so she --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- was too small to be a show dog.
L:  Right.
R:  So um they sold her as a family pet and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- we were very lucky, you know, to get her and um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then when we bred her, we had a hard time finding a mate for her because she was so small.
L:  Yeah.
R:  A normal size Miniature Schnauzer, the puppies would of been too big for her.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  So you were developing your -- developing your own little mini mini's there, huh?
R:  Our little mini mini's, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  I love Schnauzers.  I think they're the cutest dogs.
R:  Yeah, yeah, and we were very lucky.  She wasn't yappy.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  And she didn't snap and you know --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- yeah, she -- she was a really good dog.
L:  That's great.
R:  And -- yeah.  We had her the whole time with the kids, you know?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And my -- my kids were like two and four when we got her, so they grew up with her and um --
L:  I think that's the best way to do it, is to have --
R:  Me, too.
L:  -- have the dogs with the kids and --
R:  Yes.  Yes, definitely.  And I think -- I think it's important, now, like my daughter um just had a baby in February and she's --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- had her dog for, like, a year and a half.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So the dog's nose was a little out of joint when they brought this baby --
L:  I bet.
R:  -- in.  Yeah.  Yes.
L:  I bet.  
R:  So I think it's better to have the baby first and then get the dog.
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  And when the children are old enough --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to appreciate it.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, that's -- I -- I definitely agree.
R:  But nobody asked me my opinion, so [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  Oh.
R:  Yeah, now my son and his wife have a dog as well and don't have any children yet.
L:  Uh oh.
R:  So [LAUGH] --
L:  Well, you got to take the animal's feelings into consideration, 'cause --
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  -- I mean, they're gonna have an opinion too.
R:  Absolutely, and I mean, when they're number one --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for so long and then you bring this new little thing in the house that does nothing but make noise and smell --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know?  
L:  It made me feel so terrible.  A friend of mine had a baby uh last year, I think, and ah, you know, we went up to see her and everything and they had had a cat who was like fourteen years old and the cat was just pushed completely to the side while the had the baby, and of course --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's natural to, you know, make --
R:  Right.
L:  -- a big fuss over the baby, but I felt worse for that cat.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  And anybody in the situation -- everybody --
R:  Yes, that's --
L:  -- else was, like, "Oh, look at the cute baby".  I'm like, "Look at the poor cat".
R:  Oh, yeah, especially when the cat is that old.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, has been in the family for a long time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's -- yeah, it makes it hard.  But you know, there are people that would say they're just animals, they'll adjust.  
L:  Oh.
R:  They're not people, you know?
L:  I'm --
R:  I -- I'm not one of them.
L:  I don't know about that [LAUGH].
R:  No.  No.  [LAUGH]. 
L:  I don't know about that.
R:  No.  Our pets have always been part of our family.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Always.  Yep.
L:  Yeah.  I haven't -- the entire time I grew up, my family had pets.  I had -- we had lizards and birds when I was real little and then it wasn't --
R:  Oh, right.
L:  -- until we moved when I was, like, twelve, that I got a -- you know, a real pet.
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  And ever since then I haven't spent, you know, more than a day --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- away from any of the animals.
R:  The animals, right.  Right.  Yeah.  I -- I think it's great for kids when they're growing up to have pets.
L:  Yeah, I think it te- teaches them, you know, respect and responsibility and --
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.  Yep.
L:  -- a lot of good stuff.
R:  Yep.  I agree.  I agree.  Definitely.  It's -- you know, and -- and you can't get a pet and -- for the kids and then not have them involved in their care and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- their training and stuff.  It's --
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  You know, that -- that's kind of silly to do that.  So --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  But um, you know, it's -- uh, a lot of people out there just have dogs outside all the time.
L:  Oh, that's horrible.
R:  I just -- I -- I can't see that.
L:  I know.
R:  I mean, why bother to have the dog?
L:  What makes me sick is the number of people in this neighborhood who have cats who just let them run the streets.
R:  Oh.
L:  And I mean, this isn't -- it's -- it's kind -- our neighborhood is kinda small, kinda quiet and everything, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- there's, you know, a giant road, like an interstate highway running right through the middle of town.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So it just makes me sick.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I can't -- I couldn't stand to think of all my animals out running around on the streets.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, you wouldn't do that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- with your kid.
R:  No.  No.  Right, right.  And -- and you know, they -- they're -- they don't know any better than a kid either, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  They go out in the street, they don't know.  It's uh -- yeah, it's not good.  I -- I -- I feel bad actually when I see people who live in cities that have big animals.
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  Oh, my gosh.  I can't believe -- I -- you know, two Great Danes in a three -- three room apartment.
L:  Well, you know --
R:  How -- oh.
L:  -- it seems to me that the larger the dog, the smaller the apartment.
R:  Yes.
L:  It really seems like it goes that way.
R:  Yes, I think so, too.  Yes.
L:  I mean, the people in our neighborhood, they have pit bulls and they're all -- I think they're all, like, the age that they are now, that they --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- pretty much all came from the same litter.
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  But now they're breeding them.
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  So everybody has puppies right now and you know, it's all apartments and everything around here.  I don't know what they expect to do with all these dogs.
R:  Oh, these dogs.  Oh, my gosh --
