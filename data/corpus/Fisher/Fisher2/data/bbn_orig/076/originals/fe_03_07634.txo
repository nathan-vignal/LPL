R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.  
R:  Um, I'm Gloria and I'm from Pennsylvania.  What about you?
L:  I'm from Michigan.  My name is Pat Howard.
R:  Okay.  Do you have a pet?
L:  Yes, I do.
R:  Um, do you refund?
L:  Yes, I do. 
R:  I -- do you get Refunding Makes Sense?
L:  Uh, no I don't.
R:  I thought I saw a Pat Howard uh -- name in there before, but uh I guess we're supposed to talk about pets.
L:  Oh [LAUGH] okay.  Yeah.
R:  What do you have?
L:  I have two cats right now.  Uh, they're both strays.  I live in an apartment house.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I had a all white cat for about nineteen years and I had to put her down.  She was a stray, too.
R:  Mm.
L:  So these people that live around me move in, have pets and then they move out and leave --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the pets behind.  
R:  Right.  
L:  So I've taken to feeding them and watering them and two have wandered in.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And they've made residence here.  So --
R:  Um I have two dogs and a cat --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- but I did have a cat that I had for sixteen and a half years and I had --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to have her put down.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But the cat I have now, his name is Squeaky --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- and he's a big monstrous cat and people look at him and say, "Oh, no, his name is Squeaky?"
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  He weighs about fifteen pound.  He's neutered and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- he's orange.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I have two dogs.  I have um a -- well, it's like a poodle, but I got it at the animal shelter and it's uh -- they said a cockerpoo, but it looks like a poodle with a tail.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I have to get him clipped and he's about twelve years old.
L:  Oh.  
R:  And he takes fluid pills um to keep the fluid out of his lungs.  If not, he coughs and hacks.  
L:  Oh.
R:  And then I have another dog that will be two in July and I have that dog because my daughter got a dog and her husband's from the city and he doesn't pay any attention, that female dogs do have puppies if you don't keep them in a fence.
L:  Yes, I know.
R:  So I took one of the puppies and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and Scooter is so stupid.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Huh.  Um, she is um like a Dachshund --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- bred with a small Lab.
L:  Oh.
R:  So she has short legs like a Dachshund --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- then she has -- her -- her face is like a -- a Lab.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So people have said to me, "What's wrong with that dog's legs?"  You know? 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  'Cause her legs are short like a Dachshund.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  So do you spend a lot of time with your pets?
L:  Yes, I do.
R:  I do, too.
L:  Yes, I do.  I love 'em to death.
R:  Yes.
L:  They're my babies.  My kids have all grown up --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so now they're my babies.
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  Yeah.  I feed 'em whenever they want.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] I let them go out whenever they want, you know?
R:  Well, Tippy goes out whenever he wants and he comes back and Scooter does, too --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but uh the -- I leave her out on a chain because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he likes to run off.
L:  Oh.
R:  Check out the neighborhood.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And my cat, he goes out when he wants to, but it's not very often 'cause he's afraid outside.
L:  Oh.
R:  And he just wants to go out long enough to get grass.
L:  Oh [LAUGH].  
R:  Okay, why would --
L:  You know, you can buy grass.
R:  Well, I live in the country.
L:  Oh.  Oh.  Well, that's good.
R:  Yeah.  I live --
L:  I live in the city, so --
R:  Yeah.  Did you ever plant catnip for your cats?
L:  Yes.  I've got it planted right now.
R:  Do you?
L:  Out in a big pot, it sits on my front porch, yep.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Mm.
R:  Well, usually I get some just here on the farm.  I mean, we don't farm, but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- or I get it and I freeze it.
L:  Yeah, that's what I'm doing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yep.  So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when they start looking at your plants from the middle of the winter --
L:  [LAUGH] yeah.
R:  -- think, "Well, it's time to get out some catnip".
L:  Well, you know how to keep uh cats out of your plants?
R:  No?
L:  Put mothballs in 'em.
R:  Oh.  
L:  Yeah, that's what I had to do and I told my daughter about it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  'Cause her cats kept digging in her plants, so --
R:  Well, my cat don't do it a lot.
L:  Oh.
R:  It's just when he wants something green, like grass and catnip.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  I imagine I could probably freeze a little -- a handful of grasses, too.
L:  Yeah.  Well, during the winter, I went to the pet store and they have these -- oh, it looks like a little, tiny small tray --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that got grass seeds in it and you just water it and stick it in the sun.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And the grass comes up.
R:  And your cat likes it?
L:  Oh, he loved it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, he loved -- he lay his head in there and everything.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  And then he'd eat it and then it'd grow again and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Well, my dogs don't eat grass that much because they eat lettuce.
L:  Oh [LAUGH] okay.
R:  If I'm making a salad, you'd think I'm passing out steak.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Because they're right there for lettuce leaves.
L:  Lettuce?  Well, that's good [LAUGH].
R:  So they don't eat much grass.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They would rather have their lettuce.
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH].
R:  Some cats -- some dogs and -- and things do like, you know, vegetables.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, you asked me in the beginning if I refund.  I -- yes, I do refund.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Uh, have you had -- seen my name up on the computer or --
R:  Um, I don't know.  I go into Refunding Makes Sense.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Um, I -- I don't know.  I just thought I saw it on the computer, or um whatever.  Why don't you give me your name and phone number really quick?

R:  And then, uh, when I get a new phone card, we can -- I can call you and we can talk about other things besides pets.  
L:  Okay.
R:  We'll talk about refunding.
L:  Oh, I'd love to.
R:  Okay.  
L:  My daughter's a great refunder, too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, we have to do a good job, talking about pets.
L:  Yes, about pets.  Yes [LAUGH].
R:  About pets, yes.  My daughter just had to have a horse put down.
L:  Oh.
R:  And she had -- this horse was thirty four or thirty five.
L:  Oh, wow.  Yeah.
R:  And she's had it since she's been, like, in seventh and eighth grade and she's thirty five now and it was really a traumatic thing for her.
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  And --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- she's planting rose bushes on the horse's grave.
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  So I think that is her way of --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- dealing with it.
L:  Yes, that's nice.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.  I -- I get so involved with these animals --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like, but you know, when I had to put my cat down, it -- the cat and I cried the night before, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  I cried, the cat sat there and looked at me --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and next day I took her to the vet.  My --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- daughter broke down and cried and I took the cat's little blanket in with her and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I told the -- the girl, I said, "Would you give her the blanket when you put her to sleep?"  She said, "Yes, we will" and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I had to leave.  I had to.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  She wanted to know if I wanted to stay.  I said, "No, I don't want to see it", you know?
R:  Oh.  Uh, I think -- they say that people that have pets live longer because --
L:  Well, that's good.  That's good.
R:  -- they have -- they have a good reason to get up in the morning.
L:  Oh, well, yeah [LAUGH].  They wake you up [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  Yes.
L:  I know mine do.
R:  "It's time to feed us".  You know?
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  "Time to feed us or I got to go outside".
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, Squeaky sometimes lays on the bed.  When you're making the bed, he likes to get under the covers and --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- play. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  He's a character.
L:  Well, one of these stray cats I let in, it's a big, fat grey one, and when he wants to go out, he reaches up to the door knob --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he rattles it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So if I'm sleeping and I hear this --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I get up and let him out.  I'm like, this is a smart cat, uh-huh.
R:  Oh, yes, they do communicate with you.
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.  Yep. 
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  I think a lot of animals do.  They communicate with people that is aware of it, and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- is aware what's going on and they help the loneliness and --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I live alone. 
R:  Oh, do you?
L:  Yes.  I -- I'm just me.  My kids have all grown and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I'm do- I'm divorced, have been divorced for a long time.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And this is my life, my cats, you know?
R:  Right.  
L:  My cat.
R:  Right.  
L:  You know?
R:  Do you get little play toys for him?
L:  Oh, yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I've give 'em everything, just like they were babies, you know?
R:  Mhm.  
L:  Have special plates for 'em and oh, yeah.
R:  Mine is no special cat.  He's just a barn cat.  
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  But he's big.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  But uh I would like to have more, if my husband would let me, but he doesn't like pets.
L:  Oh.  Oh.  [LAUGH].
R:  'Cause I love pets.
L:  Oh, I do, too.
R:  And -- and I do have to keep the amount of pets I have down --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because of vet bills and stuff, you have to be able to afford --
L:  Oh, I know --
R:  -- to take care of 'em.
L:  I know it.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I know.  Wow.
R:  We have an old country vet's about eighty years old.
L:  Oh.  
R:  And he's --
L:  Best kind.
R:  -- he's still working.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know?  He's terrific.  
L:  Best kind.  They know all about 'em, don't they?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, they sure do.  He's very gentle with them, too.  If --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you take him a sick animal, he really -- he's really sympathetic, you know, when he's taking my dog's temperature 'cause it was sick and had a fever and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And he --
