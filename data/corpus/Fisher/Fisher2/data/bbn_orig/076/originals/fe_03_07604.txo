R:  Hi, I'm Elizabeth, from New Hampshire.
L:  Uh, I'm Will, New York.
R:  Hi, Will, how are you?
L:  I'm all right.  I watch baseball.
R:  Do you?  I watch -- I like, um, basketball and, um, what's your favorite team, your baseball team?
L:  The Mets.
R:  The Mets.  Oh, I used to be a Red Sox fan.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, you like, Clemmens?
R:  Yeah, I do.  He used to be ours.  [LAUGH]
L:  But is he going to wear that hat in the baseball hall of fame?  Your hat?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  There's a lot of fuss about that now.
R:  Oh, I know, I heard he was going to boycott I think.
L:  Yeah, he said he was -- wasn't going to go unless he could wear, uh, a Yankees hat.  Seems a bit unfair to me because, I mean, he made most of his living at the Red Sox didn't he?
R:  I know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  Some other sports --
R:  It seems kinda strange doesn't it?
L:  -- yeah, what other sports do you watch?
R:  Let's see, um --
L:  I like soccer, personally.
R:  I'm just actually getting into soccer.  I don't know the game but I'm just getting into it.
L:  Yeah.  Women's soccer is better in this country.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, the American women's team is really good.
R:  Oh, I'll have to start watching that.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Now is the sea- -- like, is the season just starting?  Or am I missing it?  Is it over?
L:  No.  It's -- it's going on now.  It's MLS but the MLS is no good at all really.  It's only the international stuff that's any good. 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  You know, when they -- well, like, when the American women's team plays someone like Mexico or England or someone --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's really good, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Yeah, just in --
L:  So, did -- when you watch basketball, what team do you watch?
R:  The Celtics, the Boston Celtics.
L:  Oh, right, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Mm.  And what happened with the, uh, -- the, uh, finals?  Did you watch that at all?
R:  No.  I didn't get to watch that.
L:  So, if your team's not in it, you don't watch it?
R:  What?
L:  If your team's not in the finals, you don't watch -- you only -- 
R:  Oh, I used to be -- 
L:  -- you only watch the, uh --
R:  I haven't -- I just wasn't into the team this year.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I used to be, like, really big into them but, you know, I just haven't been so much this year 'cause it just, I don't know.
L:  I watched it myself, you know, but I didn't -- it was -- I found it really boring.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, it just -- there wasn't anything to -- I just didn't get excited about it this year.
L:  I think, you know, with basketball, you've really got to support the team.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, otherwise I just can't get into it.
R:  Right.
L:  And I don't support any New York teams really.  I mean, the Knicks, uh, not the Knicks, the, uh, Nets really, but I still couldn't get -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- into it, you know.  And they get paid so much money it's -- it's ridiculous, you know, 
R:  Oh, my gosh, I know.
L:  And that Jason Kidd is their star player.  And as soon as they lost it to the, um [LIPSMACK] Spurs, the San Antonio Spurs, he talks about -- he's going to go and play for them.
R:  Oh, my gosh!
L:  So, there's no loyalty at all.  I just can't believe it.
R:  Boy, the fans must have been really upset when he made those comments.
L:  Well, the fans, you know [MN] the fans you see, there's only -- there's so few in the thing, I don't know.  I think it's a, you know, like in New York it's a really black sport.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, the support is all blacks.
R:  Argh.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think the New York, you know, it's like all [PAUSE] I don't know, I could be completely wrong.  But most people I know who are white couldn't care less about [LAUGH] basketball.
R:   [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't want to sound like a racist, you know what I mean? 
R:  That's okay.
L:  You know what I man?  But everyone cares about the Yankees or the Mets.
R:  Right.
L:  We have murders there over, you know, like locally.
R:  Really.  Over bar- -- like bar fights and stuff?
L:  Well, not really.  Not-- doesn't get that bad, you know --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- what I mean.  But if you go -- like this weekend the Yankees are playing the Mets.
R:  Mm.
L:  At Shea stadium.
R:  Okay.
L:  And it's like, uh, I mean, it really is like, um, [LIPSMACK] the --
R:  Like [inaudible]. 
L:  -- World Series to us.
R:  Oh.
L:  You know.
R:  Like fights and stuff.
L:  Yeah.  Well, you know what I mean, like, it's just -- 'cause all the Yankee fans they think that the, uh, I don't know, w- -- how -- the sun shines out of their backsides, you know.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  We've won the World Series and that.  They tend to be very overpowering, you know.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Whereas Met fans are moe sort of blue collar as well.
R:  I know, I think, I mean, you know, I'm definitely not, um, you know, her- -- anywhere around Boston here, wh- -- because of the Red Sox, nobody likes the Yankees either.
L:  Yeah, which is great.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean we share something in common.
R:  That's right.
L:  You know, but I mean, I f- -- I don't hates them more, you, or us.
R:  I think, well, I think that -- I think us Red Sox fans are pretty beaten down.  [LAUGH] I don't think we have too --
L:  Well, you got that great pitcher.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, you got that great, Pedro --
R:  Martinez. 
L:  Yeah, he's a fantastic pitcher.
R:  [COUGH] That's true.
L:  But isn't he a bit -- he always come across a bit arrogant.
R:  He does.
L:  Do you like him personally?
R:  No, personally I don't.  I'm n- -- I mean, but, I mean, you know, he's a good pitcher.
L:  The way he talks, you know, sometimes -- yeah, I know, you got to give him that with the pitcher.  I mean, there's some people that play for the Mets that I don't like at all.  Like, Tom Gladman[?], he's a pitcher for the Mets.  I don't like him.
R:  Yeah.  Has he got an attitude?
L:  Well, he used to play for the Braves.  And when he played for the Braves for, like, twenty years, he hated the Mets.
R:  Ooh.
L:  And I find it unbelievable that when he comes to the Mets and he gets fifty million bucks, suddenly he loves the Mets.
R:  Yeah, that --
L:  I mean, things don't work that way do they?
R:  No.
L:  He's got to, you know, he's got to still have that thing in his head that he loves the Braves.  His family still lives in Atlanta.
R:  Ooh.
L:  And the two times they played the Braves -- the Mets -- he -- he totally screwed the game up and gave 'em the game.
R:  Oh, God!
L:  So, I'm thinking maybe he still plays for them.
R:  Well, you gotta wonder though.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  You know.
L:  You know, actually I'm English, you know.
R:  I thought from the accent you might be.
L:  Yeah, but I've been here for so many years I can't leave the accent.  But baseball --
R:  I love English accents; I hope you don't lose it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know how you fe- -- how do you feel about it?  Do you want to lose it?  Or not?
L:  Oh, it's impossible.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think when you're young you could lose it.  When you get older, you can't lose it.
R:  Well, I hope --
L:  You don't sound like a Bostonian at all.
R:  Oh, good.  I'm glad because well --
L:  'Cause I've heard some --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- Boston people with terrible accents.
R:  Yeah. I think they're pretty ugly.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It sounds so weird. 
R:  So, I'm glad I don't.  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's about the only accent I can say, "Wow man, that person must come from Boston" you know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But it seems it's just sort of posh Boston people, isn't it?
R:  Well, it does seem to be that way, doesn't it?  I mean, it's almost as if they kind of put it on.
L:  Yeah.  It sounds some sort of, like, strange English accent.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, like talking out of their nose.
R:  I ha- -- I hate it myself.  [LAUGH] 
L:  It must be so embarassing.
R:  It is.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, it's exactly the same with me because people think if you're English, you got to talk like Prince Charles.
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, hello [inaudible] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, like, and I don't talk like that at all.  But, and then people think you're Australian because you don't talk like him, you know.
R:  Ooh.  What part of England were you from?
L:  London.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  Yeah, I miss it, you know. 
R:  Oh, I bet.  I was there once in nineteen eighty nine, for six weeks and I loved it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I, like, dream constantly about going back theres and I love to go [inaudible]. 
L:  Yeah, so does my wife and she's American.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  But her -- her family -- someone in her family's really ill.
R:  Ooh.
L:  From you know, with Alzheimers.
R:  Ooh.
L:  So, I got to be here, you know.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
L:  You know, I'd love to go back tomorrow.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Do you think you'll get there -- I mean, do you think eventually you'll get to go back?
L:  Oh, yeah.  Eventually, yeah.
R:  Good.
L:  You know, but at -- at the moment it doesn't really min- -- wh- -- um, [LIPSMACK] [inaudible] we're meant to be talking about sports, I'm sorry.
R:  Oh, that's all right.
L:  I often wonder if they listen to the phone call and if you stop talking about sports, they might say, you know, like, hey, you know, you got to --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- get back to your [MN] [LIPSMACK] ...
R:  So, what other sports -- is it just --
L:  I've run out of sports to talk about.
R:  -- what other sports do you like?
L:  Well, I watch boxing.
R:  Boxing, oh!
L:  But it's a bit vicious.
R:  Yeah.  It's too v- -- see it's, like, t- to me it's, like, too violent so I don't watch boxing.
L:  Yeah.  So, I think it's a man's sport.  Sort of that testosterone, you know.
R:  I can see that.  But the secon- -- I just like, you know, I feel like somebody's getting hurt and it's bloody and I'm, like, I don't want to watch that.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, what about wrestling?
R:  Like pro wrestling.
L:  Yeah.  It's ridiculous isn't it? 
R:  It's -- it's, like, totally fake isn't it?
L:  Yeah.  That's what I think.  I can t believe that it's so popular though.
R:  Oh, I know, I have a lot of girlfriends who are, like, so into it.  And I'm, like, "But the whole thing, I mean, it's like you're going to watch, like, a play or something".
L:  Yeah, really, yeah.
R:  It's all staged.
L:  Everything just looks rehearsed. 
R:  I know and I mean, that, like, you know, I don't like boxing, but I can watch that because I don't feel like anybody's getting hurt, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause it's so fake.
L:  Mm.  Mm.
R:  So, it's, like, not even, to me it's like not even a sport.
L:  You know what's a really coning sport in this country is soccer.
R:  Well, I mean, with, uh --
L:  It's a massive -- 
R:  -- I've heard about soccer through, like, um, that guy, Beckham
L:  Yeah, he's a fantastic player.
R:  You know, it seems like everybody's hearing about him now.  He's soccer, right?
L:  He's just going to Real Madrid.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  It's a big story in Eng- -- in Europe.
R:  Ooh.
L:  He played for Manchester United and now he's going to Real Madrid for forty million bucks.
R:  Oh, my good- --
