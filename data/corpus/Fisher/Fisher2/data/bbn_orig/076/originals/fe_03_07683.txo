R:  Hello, I'm Keisha.
L:  [SIGH] Hi, I'm Nick.
R:  Hi, how you doing?
L:  Hey, I'm okay. [SIGH]
R:  And where you calling from?
L:  Uh, well this is Minneapolis.
R:  Minneapolis, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm in New York.
L:  New York, hey.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Great. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  Well, okay, I do not have a life partner. [LAUGH] I'm young so I have no --
R:  How old are you?
L:  I'm, uh, twenty eight.
R:  Twenty eight, oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, a young twenty eight. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  A young, immature twenty eight. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  So, um, I don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  So, what's important, um --
L:  I -- I just have to plead ig- ignorance on this one.  I mean, I -- I know --
R:  Well, you know what you want in -- in, like, a person that you would -- would spend the rest of your life with, right?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, I know what's required, that's for sure.
R:  Like what?
L:  Um, yeah -- just the similar appreciation of [MN] um, s- -- nature and other people and meditation and [MN] [LAUGH] -- I had -- there's plenty of things that -- that I know are absolutely required, um, but I -- and obviously attraction is important, that she's, I don't know --
R:  Oh yeah, gotta be attracted. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, absolutely --
R:  You gotta be attracted.
L:  -- I mean, that -- that's something you just can't create -- it's not something that can be made up, uh, so --
R:  Mm, very true.
L:  [SIGH] I don't know [SIGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- um, [MN] but I [LAUGH] -- I don- -- I guess, now I only have imitated [MN] -- limited experience, I just have to plead ig- -- ignorance on this one, I just don't know what -- what I would be looking for, 'cause I'm not looking for it. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, well, I mean, for me, I guess, definitely, I'll have to trust the person --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- and then, of course, like you said, get -- they gotta be att- -- I gotta be attracted to them --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and then, we sti- -- we have to be able to, you know -- be able to talk to each other, 'cause then, I only hear about these relationships -- or not hear about them, but [SIGH] y- -- there'll be these cases where, like, they'll -- the husband and wife, like, don't talk and they're, like, cursing each others out -- each other out constantly and they're abusive to each other and [SIGH] different --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  -- things like that, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you definitely have to be able to get along and not, you know, be cursing each other out and beating each other up or anything, so, yeah --
L:  [MN] Yeah, absolutely, um, yeah, that's something I'm actually learning, um, how to [SIGH] -- how to have a neutral moment. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Are you hot tempered?
L:  No, actually, I'm the person that if something makes me angry I don't figure out that I'm angry two -- until two weeks later. [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.
L:  I have, like, a, [NOISE] uh, a very silent un- unknown temper, um, yeah, [MN] like, um -- [MN] yeah, so, [NOISE] mm, I'm in a -- I -- I absolutely hear what you're saying. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm. [MN]
L:  And then, you know, it's important to communicate well and, um, um, [MN] a lot of times if -- well,  hell, everyone argues, um --
R:  Well, that's true.
L:  -- and there, you know, there will be conflict, [NOISE] th- -- you know, it's just a matter of how -- how, you know, how do these two people handle the conflict.
R:  Mm.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do they learn growing up?  But even then, I mean, just because someone's healthy, doesn't mean I want them to be a life partner, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.
L:  I mean, then there's all the attraction stuff and, [SIGH] I don't know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah, [SIGH] [several inaudible words]. 
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, so what else? 
L:  Has your -- has your experience been, um -- I mean, have you -- have you had much experience?  Have you --
R:  I've had one boyfriend --
L:  Uh-huh, is it really serious?
R:  -- in my -- and I'm still with him --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- so, uh, we've been together for four years and I'm twenty, so -- and we've --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- been together for, like, four years.  Um --
L:  So, you started young.
R:  Yeah --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- I've been with him for quite some time now.
L:  You know, I used to, um, judge that, or think, "Oh, that could never work" but, I don't know, I guess, I've seen it -- I've seen it work.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I don't think that there's anything wrong about that, it presents it's own challenges, you know.
R:  Well, yeah, I mean the fact is is that [MN] -- thing is though, he is my only boyfriend, there the temptation that's kind of like, "Okay, well you're the only guy I've ever kissed, been with, period" and it's like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- "What else is out there, babe?" [LAUGH] 
L:  What else is out there? [LAUGH] Exactly.
R:  And it's like. "Okay, so --" what I don't w- -- I mean, he's a great guy, so definitely [COUGH] don't want to do that, so --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- just really gotta exhibit --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- some control. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, well that's -- that's something that maybe four years ago, the two of you weren't sure that that's what you were --
R:  Please, when we talk about it now, he'd be, like, "Oh, I never planned on this, when we were going out I never planned on --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- even lasting this long" --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and he's like, "I couldn't have imagined that we'd be sitting here today, like --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- you know, still together" and I'll think, "That's the damn truth" I'm like, "Damn it, I've been with you since high school --"
L:  Wow.
R:  [several inaudible words]. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] See --
R:  But it's good.
L:  -- that's -- that's real interesting, um, [SIGH] th- -- mm, I, uh, hm -- I've had, you know, several relationships --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, [MN] men or women and, um, you know, I guess going into each of them, neither of us thought that we would, you know, partner or anything, 'cause we weren't looking for partners, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, you know, some of them ended [LAUGH] [MN] okay, some of them ended really nicely [LAUGH] and some of them ended kind of badly --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, some of them were just awkward, but, you know, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  --you know, c- -- each -- each relationship kind of has it's own arc, kind of like a story or a play or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I guess, [NOISE] and, you know -- beginning, middle and end and, um, [SIGH] I've, you know, I've never really experienced really wanting to, you know, settle down with one -- with --
R:  [MN] Okay.
L:  -- s- -- with someone.  Yeah, no I -- I, [MN] you know -- I -- I know the feeling, I know the desire --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and it must be really awesome to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to actually fulfill that --
R:  [NOISE] Hold on a minute.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello.  This is she.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Right. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Can I actually -- I'm sorry, can I actually call you back at the same number?  Five seven zero eight nine four three zero five four?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And what's your name? Malina, so would I c- call back and speak to you?  Marina, right?  All right, bye.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  I'm, like, getting calls on my other phone. [NOISE] But anyway, so, back to the important -- or the important factors in a life partner --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so I think that the reason why my -- me and my boyfriend have been able to stay together so long is this, like, our friendship, 'cause we were friends before we started dating, so, we were, like, the best of buddies, like, to tell the truth, like, he -- we were young and he's a guy, so, of course, um, if I'm hanging out with him and his friends, they would look at girls and be, like, "Oh" well, you know, "She has a gr- -- she has a nice ass" or something like that, so I, like, stand there while they was looking at girls and stuff like that and I was, like, " [LIPSMACK] Please, I'm not just going to stand here so that I'll start looking at girls butts too" and I was, like, "Hey, well her ass is bigger" and --
L:  Mm, mm.
R:  "-- her ass is nicer, and da da da --" and, like, we were just friends and we would just hang out and chill and go bowling and just be, but, uh -- you know, do -- do whatever and have -- and be totally cool, so --
L:  That's cool, so you kind of joined his world --
R:  Yeah, and it --
L:  -- as friends --
R:  -- exactly --
L:  -- and then --
R:  -- so, I'm like --
L:  -- yeah?
R:  -- the reason why we've been able to last so long is because it's kind of like I have a buddy there and vice versa --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and to tell the truth --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- like, even when I think -- 'cause it -- like, there's so much, like, speculation about ev- -- whether a high school relationship is going to actually last, like --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- sure, he's -- like, he's proposed and stuff like that and I'm, like, "Okay, well, we just got out of high school, so let's just wait a little while, or whatever" and then everybody's like, "Okay, well, that's the only boyfriend -- it's not going to last, 'cause you're going to get curious and you're going to cheat on him." [LIPSMACK] And then I'm, like, "Okay, well that sucks, 'cause I don't want to cheat on him and he's a great guy."
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, anyway, like --
L:  Well, they're wrong about that, um, [LAUGH] the only person who knows whether you'll cheat is you [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, and unless you have some impulse control problem --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] -- like -- or -- or, you know, some drugs or alcohol [NOISE] or something, the only person who [NOISE] -- you know what I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that is entirely up to you --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but --
R:  So, defin- definitely --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've totally lost my train of thought just now, I was really aiming at a point just now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, um -- so, yeah, like when people will say that it's going to n- -- like, it's not going to last, and I'm thinking, "Okay, well, [SIGH] you know, that -- that's not necessarily true because the fact that we are friends or whatever", like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- even if it does- -- e- -- um, even if it doesn't -- and I'm thinking, like, the way it started out, like, we would be able to end on --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a good basis and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- still be friends [SIGH] so I'm like, you know --
L:  Well, you know, um, last person I dated, she and I, um started as friends and had a really rough break up, um, but actually, we're still very good friends --
R:  That's good.
L:  -- it was a rough -- it w- --
