L:  Hi.  My name is Laurie.  Can you hear me?  
R:  Yes, I can hear you.
L:  Oh, okay.  How are you?
R:  I'm fine.  How are you?
L:  I'm fine.  
R:  Okay, this is my first call.
L:  Oh, it is?  
R:  Yeah.
L:  This is my second.
R:  Is it?  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  It's not that bad.
R:  It's not?  Okay.  [LAUGH].
L:  So do you have any pets?
R:  Yes, we have a cat and a dog.  
L:  Oh, wow.  I don't have any pets.
R:  You don't?  [LAUGH].
L:  No.  
R:  We have a Jack Russell puppy and a um like a six year old cat.
L:  Oh, wow.  
R:  He's like twenty some pounds, our cat.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  He's huge.
L:  Oh, okay.  So do they um get along?
R:  Um, no.  Actually, they fight a lot.  
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, a whole lot.  
L:  Oh.
R:  The -- um Jack Russell's are very hyper dogs.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And um she's just a puppy so --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  The cat doesn't really like her too well.
L:  Uh-huh.  Oh, okay.  
R:  Mm.
L:  So um -- wow.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  Um --
R:  Well, um, do you know if we do -- how many calls that we do?  Is it just three?
L:  Uh, it all depends.
R:  Does it?
L:  Yeah, it all depends on um if you're uh signed up and 'cause I know this is the second one, um, the call that I had and they called, like -- I want to say a couple of weeks ago --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but I have a new born so I couldn't really um participate.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And that was the first time that I had um received a phone call and I want to say in almost a month.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, but it's -- it's not that bad, but sometimes when you really don't have, you know, anything to talk about --
R:  Yeah, except for what you have in common.
L:  Right.
R:  I have a two year old daughter and a thirteen, almost fourteen month old daughter.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So --
L:  Wow.  
R:  And those are my only two that I'm having.
L:  Oh, you are?
R:  Yeah, I've got my two, God I can't handle no more.
L:  [LAUGH].  'Cause actually we're going to have one more.
R:  Are you?
L:  Um, sometime next year so we can have them, like, close in age.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ours are two mon- uh, two years and um one month apart.
L:  Oh, okay.  That's a good age.
R:  They fight a lot right now, but --
L:  Mhm.  
R:  So do we get in trouble for not talking about the subject for the whole ten minutes or --
L:  Um, not that I know of.
R:  Okay.  
L:  But I have a question.
R:  Okay.
L:  Is -- is vet bills expensive?
R:  The what?
L:  Vet bills?
R:  Vet bills?  Yeah, they are.
L:  They are?
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause my husband wanted a dog and I'm -- I'm kinda scared of dogs.
R:  Are you?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think you should get a Lab 'cause they're awesome.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, you have a newborn right now, I'd wait a little bit.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  'Cause they are big dogs, but they are really good with um children.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Excellent dogs for children.
L:  Oh, okay.  'Cause I -- actually, I -- I'd -- I'd prefer to get a fish.  
R:  Oh, that's -- I've always wanted one -- or like -- like a parrot or something.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [MN] but we never got one.  But I'd like to get a fish, too.  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh.  So is um -- do you have to take care of a pet like you would take care of -- of a --
R:  A child?
L:  Yeah?
R:  Yes.  [LAUGH].
L:  So they have to go and do check ups and go to the dentist and stuff like that, too?
R:  Well, they just go for, like, um I think it's yearly check ups.  They go for their shots, like um --
L:  They get shots too?
R:  Yeah, they get shots like rabies shots and um --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- they get um -- what else do they get?  Um, when they're puppies, you want to take 'em and get 'em dewormed just in case, you know?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And uh but the vet'll check their teeth and everything and make sure they're -- you know, doing good.  
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But you don't have to take 'em often unless they need to go.  Like um, a couple weeks ago, our little dog, she fell off the back of the couch --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- 'cause Jack Russell's like to jump a lot.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And she landed on her hip wrong so we had to take her in and they checked her over and said um -- like, gave her some pain medicine and I think that was, like, a hundred and eighty.  
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  So -- but it can get expensive, especially if you buy, like, the dog food --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- from the pet -- uh, vet and stuff like that.
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  So I think they -- I'm not sure how much it is, and it's like a big, big thing of dog food and it's like thirty bucks.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, but it lasts for, like, I don't know, about a month or so.
L:  Oh, that's good.  
R:  You have a little boy or a girl?
L:  I have a girl.  
R:  Oh.  
L:  Yeah.  You hear --
R:  How --
L:  -- her in the background?
R:  Yeah.  How old is she?  
L:  She's um -- Monday, she'll be seven weeks.
R:  Oh.  It makes me want to have another one, but --
L:  [LAUGH].  So she is itty bitty.  
R:  Do you sleep a lot?  Is she -- stay up a lot at night?
L:  Um, she's starting to get on a pattern now.
R:  That's good.
L:  And so she really kinda only -- I want to say she wakes up at um once a night, but the second time she wakes up would be the time that I'm going -- would be getting up to go to work.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I don't go back to work until August.  
R:  I stayed at home with mine and now I'm working for my step dad at -- at home doing stuff for him on the computer so --
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  Um, or all -- both of my children had colic.
L:  Oh.
R:  So -- and my last one, she uh had her days and nights mixed up.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  So would go -- yeah.  Go to sleep right when you hold her, soon as you would put her down --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- in her crib, she'd wake up.
L:  Sometime that's what my -- my little girl does.
R:  Oh, it was awful.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  What had happened was, um, it went all the way up until two and a half, three months and what was -- happening was, she wanted to be on her stomach.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Because of the colic was making her stomach hurt.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I watched her one night, put her on her stomach, and she -- you know, was turning her head --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and everything good, so my doctor said that was fine and I got to sleep good after that.
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  That was good.
L:  That's good.
R:  Mm.
L:  'Cause I find that um my little girl, she sleeps better while she's on her stomach, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- one night we left her on her -- let her sleep -- actually one Saturday, um, we let her sleep on her stomach, because we don't let her sleep on her stomach at night, and she slept all day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then wanted to -- she woke up at twelve o'clock midnight and then wanted to um stay until like four o'clock --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- in the morning.  I said she will not do that again.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  Yeah, 'cause it was -- it was a challenge.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Trying to stay up when I'm asleep -- um, actually when I'm sleeping.
R:  And you get frustrated, oh.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And exhausted.  Actually, I -- since I've had my first one, I've -- for three years now I've just been exhausted.
L:  Oh.
R:  All day, every day.  They wear me out, especially my three year old.  Oh, Lord.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You heard about the terrible two's and horrible three's?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  Is that for real?
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  But I heard that it gets only worse when they get older.  And I was like, God, please don't tell me that.  
L:  Oh, goodness.
R:  I was hoping they would get better.  She -- since she's three now, we've got her in day care.  She's doing a little bit better, but --
L:  Oh, okay.  So do -- um, your kid like the animal, your pets?
R:  Yeah.  Um, they both have a cat and um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- my three year old, she doesn't like um the dog too well because she's very hyper right now and likes to play with her and pull on hair and everything.
L:  Oh.  
R:  Oh.
L:  Oh, oh.  Somebody's crying.
R:  Yeah, one is in the bedroom and her daddy took her out.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  Well, that's good.
R:  Yeah.  So where do you live at?
L:  I live in Maryland.
R:  Okay.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'm in North Carolina.
L:  Oh, wow.  Okay.  
R:  Yeah, that's cool.
L:  Mm.
R:  I've never been up north before.
L:  Excuse me?
R:  I've never been up north before.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I might get there one day.  I've been out west.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And all the way down south, but never up north.  Have you ever been to, like, New York or anything?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Have you?
L:  But I'm actually from Pennsylvania.
R:  Are you?
L:  Mhm. 
R:  My husband's been -- he went to New York [inaudible] he went into the Twin Towers when he was younger.  He said that was cool.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But he's been there before.
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  Since the --
L:  Well, you have to come to Washington and -- and sightsee.  
R:  That'd be cool.
L:  Mm.
R:  I've always wanted to come up there and take my children too.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think that'd be interesting.  
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's nice.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yep.  So --
R:  Hm.  
L:  Is ten minutes up yet?  
R:  That's what I was -- no, it feels like it's been forever.  Mm.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  See, I don't know what to talk about or anything.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  I wanted to try it out 'cause I -- I do all kinds of surveys and stuff --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- uh mind -- to make mo- to make extra cash and stuff.  How did you find out about the tel- this thing?  
L:  About who?
R:  Just uh the telephone survey thing?  
L:  Actually, um, I'm a -- I had signed up with a um a secret shopper.
