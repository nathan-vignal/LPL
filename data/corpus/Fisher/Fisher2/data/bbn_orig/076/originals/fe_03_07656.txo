L:  Hi.
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  [LAUGH]
L:  Hi.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, my name's Lee.
L:  I'm Jean.
R:  Hi, Jean.
L:  Hi, nice to meet you.  [LAUGH]
R:  Nice to meet you too.  [LAUGH]  This is cool, isn't it?
L:  Yeah, this is kinda neat.
R:  Yeah.
L: This is kinda neat.  Where are you calling from?
R:  I'm, uh, in New York City.
L:  Okay.  Um ...
R:  Let me guess.  You're from, uh -- okay, Minnesota?
L:  No.  Vancouver Island.
R:  [MN] Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, how cool.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  All right.
L:  So, we're supposed to talk about pets.
R:  Pets.  Pets.
L:  Do you have any pets?
R:  Uh, not at the moment.  Do you?
L:  I do have a dog, one dog.
R:  Oh, you go first then.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.  And I'm getting a second dog on July the tenth.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  Um, we had a call -- we have a Bejon[?] right now and we're getting a miniature Dachshund on the ...
R:  A Bejon, they're those white ones, right?
L:  That's right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's right.  They're non allergenic, which is why we like them.
R:  Now, that's because they have hair instead of fur, is that right?
L:  Exactly.
R:  Okay.
L:  Exactly.  Very good.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I -- I remember I had a very allergic friend who was explaining to me once the difference between hair and fur --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- and I thought wow, a hyper allergenic animal that's -- that's pretty cool.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I guess we've -- I'm supposed to tell you, we spend -- what do we spend?  After -- well, first thing in the morning for an hour and then in the evenings -- in the night with the dog.  So, works out to, what, six or seven hours a day with the dog.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  So, that's what I'm -- we're supposed to talk about I guess.  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, if you had a pet ...  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I can tell you about the pets that I have had.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, I have had many, many cats.  I've had seventeen cats in my life.
L:  Wow!
R:  Yeah.  Although the most I ever had at one time, uh, was eleven.
L:  Wow!
R:  Uh, yeah.  I lived on a farm actually --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and, um, you know, we had room for that sort of -- that sort of life.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, when I moved back to New York City, um, I had five cats --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and for a while I kept those five cats in an apartment and then they just -- you know, they gradually dwindled until I had one and then I had none --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I have, um, a five year old now.  So, um, you know, I ...
L:  Five year old baby --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or five year old cat?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, a baby.  [LAUGH]  My son.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And my cats were my babies I guess at that time too.
L:  That's right.
R:  Um, but, you know, because he's so -- so much of a hand full --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I haven't, you know, really gotten any other animals.
L:  And pets do take a lotta time.
R:  Well, you know, it's funny.  I've learned that -- that the -- the amount of time that they take does not really increase --
L:  No.
R:  -- per cat.  It's like if you have one cat ...
L:  It's the same amount of time.
R:  Yeah.  You might as well have two --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- and if you have two you might as well have three and I guess that's why I had so many because you -- you just -- really ...
L:  It doesn't really matter.
R:  Yeah.  And -- and the nice thing about cats -- now, I don't know how you do with your dogs when you go away --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but with my cats, um ...
L:  You can just leave.
R:  Yeah.  No, you can't just leave.
L:  No.
R:  No.  No.  No.
L:  No.  We're going away this next weekend and we are leaving the dog with a sitter in [inaudible].
R:  Oh.
L:  Right.  Just because we usually take her with us, but I said we're like parents with a kid --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we need to get away --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and we've got the puppy coming in two weeks.  So, I said before -- three weeks I guess.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I said before he gets here we need some no dog time [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it's like dogs are the same way with cats, like with the -- with the dog once he comes here after six months it's not much -- it's no more work.
R:  Right.
L:  The first six months are harder.
R:  I see.
L:  You know, training and the whole ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  But once you get through that stage then, you know, it's the same amount of work.  You can walk one or walk two.
R:  Now, what -- what -- how old will the puppy be?
L:  He's coming in at eight weeks.
R:  Eight weeks.
L:  He'll be eight weeks old.  Yep.
R:  That seems really young.
L:  It is.
R:  I'm not a dog person, but ...
L:  Well, usually they can leave home at six.
R:  Oh.
L:  But usually prefer eight --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, with dogs and the thing with him is he's a miniature Dachshund so he can't even go up and down stairs until he's six months.
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  Yeah.  I've had them before and, uh, they weigh about seven or eight pounds.
R:  Oh, you mean when they're adults?
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I see.
L:  So -- but he won't be doing stairs for months.
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, bless his heart.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now, is it true what they say?  Do they have a lotta back problems?
L:  They do.  I actually had one that I had to have put down a few years ago.
R:  Oh, my God!
L:  Um, he had three calcified disks in his back.
R:  Oh, my God!
L:  So, yeah, it's very common and there's not always anything you can do about it.  It's not anything you did or didn't do.
R:  Oh.
L:  You know, it's just somebody with a bad hip getting arthritis, you know?
R:  Sure.
L:  There's nothing you can do about it.  It's just --
R:  It's --
L:  -- the way it is.
R:  -- due to their anatomy.
L:  That's right.
R:  Were they bred originally -- I mean, they -- they're not like an original breed, right?
L:  Well --
R:  They were bred ...?
L:  -- Dachshunds were bred originally as badger hunters in Germany.
R:  Okay.
L:  That's -- that's where they're originally bred.  Way, way back in the thirteen, fourteen hundreds.
R:  With the same physique that they have now?
L:  Yes.  Yes.
R:  How can they -- I mean, how did that -- how did that optimize their abilities to hunt badgers?
L:  They could get down the holes and in many cases you actually -- they could get the badger and then you had -- because badgers live underground in tunnels --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and sometimes they actually got stuck and they had to dig up the hole --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- to get -- because the dog couldn't get out backwards once he'd gotten in.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But they actually fit in the badger hole, which is why they were bred ...
R:  That's so fascinating.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Wow!
L:  Yep.
R:  Huh.
L:  [LAUGH] It's amazing what you find out.
R:  I knew there had to be a reason.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It just had to -- you know, something like that just doesn't seem a random thing, you know?
L:  No.
R:  It seems like something done purposefully for something.
L:  And it -- it was and the minis are just mini, they're just cute, you know, they're little lap dogs.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  So, we're looking forward to that.
R:  [MN]
L:  Yeah.  He's coming from another island actually.  So ...
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, we're very excited.
R:  Oh, that's cool.
L:  Very excited.
R:  Wow!
L:  But I'm -- I'm a cat person too.
R:  Are you?
L:  Yep.
R:  Oh.
L:  But then we discovered -- I used to get violently ill and we discovered last -- I forget -- May, April not -- no -- no, this year -- February, March that I have severe allergies and one of my high allergies is cats --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and it actually causes symptoms like a heart attack.
R:  Oh, Jesus!
L:  So, I couldn't really keep the cats anymore.  [LAUGH]
R:  I guess not.
L:  All those trips to the hospital now I know why.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my God!  What did you -- what did they do in the hospital?  Give you a shot of Epinephrine or something?
L:  No, they were just trying -- they couldn't figure out what it was and they'd keep throwing me on leads 'cause they thought I was having a heart attack.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, Jesus!  Oh, how awful.
L:  And then, of course, I'd get better 'cause I was away --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- from the cats, right, for a few hours.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my God!  Oh.
L:  So, at least now I know though.
R:  [MN] Are there any hyper allergenic cats?
L:  No, unfortunately.
R:  [MN]
L:  She's barking at the lawn mower outside.
R:  Oh.
L:  So -- so it's ...
R:  Oh, that's too bad. 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I do like talking about my animals.
R:  Oh, good.
L:  Yep.
R:  Well, that's helpful because that's our topic for the day.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Now, have you had these conversations before on this project?
L:  No, this is my first one.
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  Oh, good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's kinda fun then.
R:  It's cool.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I could get off on this.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  How did you find out about this -- this ...?
L:  A friend.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, let me know.  So ...
R:  Oh, that's neat.
L:  Yeah, and said just go wing it, it's fun, and I like to talk.  So, that's no hardship.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, there you go.  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Especially about my dogs.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, we just haven't come up with a name for the new baby yet --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and that's -- I -- like I've got a list of ideas --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I said then when I get him home we'll check out his personality.
R:  That's -- yeah, that's the way I always did.
L:  Yeah, and see which one ...
R:  They usually name themselves.
L:  Yeah.  I said I wanna see which ones work first.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  You know?  But that's the fun part of having them.  I was debating on Baxter.
R:  Baxter.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Baxter the badger hunter.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah [LAUGH], Baxter the badger hunter.  I like that.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, at least you're not gonna name him Killer or something like that.
L:  Yeah.  No, you can't name him Duke even.  [LAUGH]
R:  No.  [LAUGH]
L:  You know?  A friend of mine has one and he said, "Well, we named him Floyd after my favorite band, Pink Floyd".  I said, "I don't think [LAUGH] I wanna name a miniature Dachshund Elvis".  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Although the name Elvis is -- is sort of retro cool now.
L:  It is.  [LAUGH]
R:  You know?  I mean, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  So, we'll see how she goes.
R:  Oh, that's cool.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Wow!
L:  So, no, we, uh -- we enjoy them.  We enjoy the dogs.  But like they do take time.
R:  Yeah.  I've never had a dog.  I thought maybe a dog would be a good pet for my son, but I'm not a dog person so I don't --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- even know where to start.
L:  Do your research.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, there are dogs -- certain dogs s- suit certain lifestyles better --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, and certain dogs have better temperaments for kids.
R:  Mm.  I see.,
L:  You know?  And it's well worth the time on the Internet --
R:  Is it?
L:  -- checking.
R:  Yeah.
L:  To see what you really want.
R:  Yep.  [MN]
L:  You know, 'cause sometimes like even the small dogs need lots of en- -- need lots of exercise --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know?  So, that may not be the one you want when you've got a five year old.
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.  [LAUGH]
L:  You know?  And you don't want a skinny thing with no hair because they freeze all the time.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, you've gotta, you know, work at something that's a bit more flexible.
R:  Yeah.  That's true.
L:  You know?  So, it's -- it's well worth for all -- you know, it's a nuisance sometimes -- it's well worth the time checking.
R:  Now, isn't there such a thing as a dry mouth dog and a wet mouth dog?
L:  Uh, you know, I don't know to be honest.  I've never heard that phrase.
R:  It -- it seems to me like I read that somewhere like, for example, um, a Newfoundland is a wet mouth dog because --
L:  Oh, a drooler.
R:  -- they drool.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And like, you know, a, um -- I don't know what -- maybe a Dachshund would be a dry -- I don't know.
L:  Yeah, that would make sense.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Like they don't -- when they shake and that they don't have spit all over the place.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I think I would want the kind with the dry mouth.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't think I want, you know --
L:  Yeah.  No.
R:  -- ropes of drool going all over my wall.
L:  No.  I was in a dog show last weekend and -- and one of the -- one of the dogs before they could show it they were wiping its mouth with a great big water cloth --
R:  Oh, Lord!
L:  -- and I'm like it's not my idea of a good time.
R:  Now, do you show dogs?
L:  No.
R:  Oh, no.
L:  No, I just have fun.  [LAUGH]
R:  Did you see that movie Best in -- Best in Show?
L:  No.
R:  Oh, my ...
L:  Was that a one good?
R:  It's -- it's like, um, a mock documentary --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- by Christopher Guest.
L:  Huh.
R:  It is so hilarious.
L:  Ah.
R:  It's about these people who gather at a dog show and all the individual dramas that they go through before they go in the show.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  It sounds, you know, kind of weird, but it's just so charming.  I think it's out on video.
L:  Huh.
R:  It's adorable.
L:  Yeah.  Best of Show?
R:  Best -- Best -- would it be Best in Show or --
L:  Or Best in Show.
R:  -- Best in Show?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Something like that.  But, yeah --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- yeah, it's really cool.  [LAUGH]
L:  I may just have to get that.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's -- it's adorable.  It's such a charming film.
L:  Huh.
R:  He's the same guy who made The Spinal Tap.
