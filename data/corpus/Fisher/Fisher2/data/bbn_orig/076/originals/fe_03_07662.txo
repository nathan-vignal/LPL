R:  Hi, I'm Anna.
L:  Hi, I'm Richard.
R:  Hi, Richard --
L:  Hi, Anna, how you doing?
R:  -- nice to meet you.
L:  Nice to meet you.
R:  Fine. 
L:  So, do you have a pet? [MN]
R:  I sure do, it's funny, this is like my favorite subject.  I have a pet, she is laying on my lap right now, her name is Bianca, she'll be two years old on August twenty ninth.  She's a Brittany col -- Brittany spaniel and border collie mixed and she's like a daughter to me, I take her every single where I go except for work or ch- -- I'm unemployed right now, so she pretty much goes everywhere I go --
L:  Oh, so you get to spend some time with her. [MN]
R:  Yes, and I love her and my actual, um, dream some day is to have, like, a preserve for unwanted pets.
L:  Oh, you know, that's so funny, this topic is so perfect. [SIGH] I live in Pennsylvania but I'm in Arizona right now [LIPSMACK] with my daughter and my dau- -- this is what my daughter does [MN] is she rescues cats and she's really into -- ther- there's a preserve out here that they're -- for all kinds of unwanted animals and, uh, they're just really, really, really into it out here.  And, uh, she has eight cats.  They're -- they're just cruising around the house and we have -- we have two yellow labradors, uh -- they're back home though, of course, and, um, they are -- they are definitely like our children.  I mean, if we could take them everywhere, we would, but, uh, two l- -- two large --
R:  How old are they?
L:  We have, let's see, Abby is going to be twelve and Riley is the youngest, he's five and it -- the young one makes the -- the old one just seem like -- like -- like she's two years old. [LAUGH] It --
R:  Oh, that's great.
L:  Oh, it's  -- it's just hysterical, they're -- they're t- -- like two little kids, constantly doing, you know -- just constantly causing trouble, but -- but they're just wonderful, I mean, they're absolut- -- I -- I don't know what we would do without them, it's one of those things, they're just -- just the love of our lives. [LAUGH]
R:  I cannot see how people would -- could live without pets, my mom's like that, she cannot understand why someone would prefer the company of an animal to the company of a person --
L:  Um --
R:  -- and it's not even necessarily so much that, it's just that pets seem to complete your life, you know --
L:  Oh, they def- -- it's that unconditional love, I think, that no matter what, they just love you, I mean, that- that's what I get from them, it's just -- they're, you know -- you can yell --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- at them and they'll come right back to you without, you know -- without any problems and --
R:  No, you can't yell at them.
L:  Well, you know, if they're real bad. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I'm just teasing, I'm teasing.
L:  I know, I can tell you love yours. [LAUGH]
R:  I do, she's a spoiled little princess --
L:  Well, that's --
R:  -- I always say --
L:  -- that's the beauty --
R:  -- that if people treated their, um, children as well as I treat her that there'd be no child abuse.
L:  [LAUGH] That's probably true. [SIGH] So, what, um -- what all do you -- what do you do with your -- your dog?  What o- -- kind of things do you do?
R:  Um, well, we go camping, we go to the river, we go visit other --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- dogs and we go to the dog park, we play, we do all kinds of things.  What do you do with your doggies?  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I live in Oregon, by the way.
L:  Oh, wonderful.  Well, we have a lake that's about, maybe twenty minutes from our house where we live.  It's, uh -- it's a big manmade lake, but it's not real populated, so we -- we love -- the dogs love to go play fetch in the lake and as far as you can throw the tennis ball, they will get in and they will swim all the way out and br- -- I mean, all day long.  Until -- really until they drop down, you know, exhausted.  They just ab- --
R:  Labradors are pretty much water dogs, aren't they?
L:  Oh, yes, absolutely, they just -- they love the water.  Now, it' so funny because we had -- the little one, when we first got him as a puppy [SIGH]--
R:  Riley?
L:  -- Riley, right, we -- he fell into our swimming pool and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and he'd never been in water before, so he -- he had a deathly fear of water, right off the bat, because he didn't know -- he didn't understand what it was and so for the longest time, we couldn't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- get him near water, I mean, near -- we'd take him to the lake and he'd just -- he'd -- he'd walk up to the edge as soon as he'd -- he'd smell the water or whatever it was, he'd run back screaming, he couldn't -- he -- he couldn't -- couldn't handle it.  Take him to a d- -- like, almost a dry riverbed where they could walk through without any problems and he'd just -- he'd put his paw in and just jump back.  Like, two years it took to get him accustomed to water and now it's like you can't keep him out of it.  But it was the funniest thing, this little teeny yellow puppy just cruising around the swimming pool, I mean, he was doing fine, but he -- he didn't know any better [SIGH] and it just had -- he just had this deathl- deathly fear of water for almost two years. [MN] But, uh --
R:  Oh.
L:  That's -- tha- -- and he loved car rides, [MN] I don't know h- --
R:  Oh, of course.
L:  -- yeah, so I don't know how -- how legal in most places it is these days, but I know where we are, there's, uh -- you're -- you're still allowed to do it, I know you can't put them in the back of trucks and things, which is great, I never understood why they'd do that to begin with, but [SIGH] we, uh -- we love it and the little one, of course, just runs back and forth, knocking the big one, you know, the older one over, back and forth across the back seat from window to window to window.
R:  Oh, how cute.
L:  Oh, it is.  Well, [LAUGH] it's cute, but after a while, like I said, the -- the one's eleven and they get -- labs -- labs tend to peak out around eleven or twelve and, uh, we're doing real well with ours, like I say, she's just -- she's fantastic and she doesn't know that she's twelve or, you know, eleven or whatever, she thinks -- she really thinks she's two years old. [SIGH] So, it's just --
R:  Do you feed her special food and stuff?
L:  Yeah, she gets IAMS Active Maturity, since she's active, and, um --  that -- she seems to love it, I mean, a- absolutely love it.  It's real good for her digestive system and all that, so sh- -- so, you know, we don't -- we -- we really don't have any problems with 'em, which is wonderful.  The only -- the only time they're for the vet is for their shots, you know, and -- and for, uh, the heart worm tests and stuff, but, basically, just totally healthy, happy dogs. [LAUGH] And we also have a --
R:  Yeah, Bianca's healthy too.
L:  -- yeah, we also have a cat.  And the cat -- the cat actually came from Arizona here, a couple of years ago.  The d- -- um, the daughter came home for Christmas and brought us one of her rescued strays, but the dogs and the cat don't get along, of course.  So, the cat had -- [LAUGH] the cat had it's own room with a window that it could go --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- in and out.  Yup [MN] --
R:  -- how cute.
L:  -- that it could go in and out of all the time [MN] and then, now, the -- the dogs go to sleep with us at, like, maybe eleven at night [MN] and the cat lives downstairs and will come upstairs [LAUGH] --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and hang out in the house so the cat is on, uh -- on night watch and then in the morning we get up, let the dogs out of the room, the cat is either, like, it perched very -- hidden precariously somewhere upstairs and you just hear the bell going downstairs.  It's so funny. [SIGH] But, it -- it -- it's just wonderful, this cat was just -- it was really on death's door and, um, [MN] I in- -- the -- the daughter's name is Ahmee, she just -- she's so wonderful with these animals, she just -- any time -- she works actually at a vet out here in, uh -- in Arizona, we're in Chandler, Arizona and --
R:  It's wonderful what she does.  Tell her that I said, "God bless her", it's just a --
L:  Oh, [MN] --
R:  -- blessing --
L:  -- h- -- I --
R:  -- to have people like that taking care of the unwanted pets.
L:  -- everytime they bring someone in that, uh, a dog that they have to put down, or a cat or something, she finds a home for it.  She will -- she takes -- they -- the people here are just fantastic and she -- she literally was an office manager [MN] and they [LAUGH] -- they actually bid over who's going to pay for the operation if it's, you know, like they have people that come in and just want to put the dog down because they can't bear, um, you know, puppies and stuff like that -- all kinds of, just, amazing stuff, you'd never think that, you know -- how cruel these people could actually be, just --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you know, you have the dog and you don't want it because it can't provide puppies?  You know, and -- and it just doesn't make sense.  But, anyway, she always finds a home for them, know -- you know, whether she has to put an ad in the paper or -- or between, like the couple of girls at the office, they'll -- they'll take them home until they can find places for them.  But just -- they almost never put the -- put the animals down. [SIGH]
R:  That's wonderful, that's so wonderful.
L:  Well, that's so funny, 'cause this -- the house here, I just -- when we got here it was, like -- literally, there's eight cats at all different, you know, places throughout the house and you'd never even know she's -- they- they're so clean you can't -- you could never smell that there was a cat in this house. [SIGH] It's absolutely amazing. [MN] Oh.  Any other animals?
R:  Well, I live in a house with roommates, so there's another dog and another cat in our house.  But, I only have Bianca.
L:  [MN]
R:  My last dog, Jack, I had for five years and then when I went to my father's funeral in another state, he ran away from the doggie sitters and tried to run home and I never saw him again and that was two years ago. [NOISE]
L:  My god. 
R:  And he --
L:  Well, that's tr- -- that's tragic.
R:  -- also, he slept with me, like, every single night of his life and stuff, up till that point and [NOISE] --
L:  Oh, I'm --
R:  -- I always wonder --
L:  -- so sorry to hear that --
R:  -- what ha- --
L:  -- that's the worst, I mean, that's just, you know, especially at a bad time to begin with and then you're, like, you lose your best friend to boot. Oh. [SIGH]
R:  It was weird, all kinds of things went through my head.
L:  Oh, just -- well, of course, I'm sure you still think it too, I mean --
R:  Yeah, sometimes I think I'll see him, when -- 'cause I live in a kind of a relatively small community, there's only a hundred and fifty thousand people and it's not very spread out and I could probably see him if he was in that town --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- somewhere, eventually.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Well, you never, you know -- you never give up hope, that's the truth. [LAUGH] Oh, that's just a sad story.  But you have your -- you have another happy one right there with you.
R:  Oh, yeah, I love her and she's a spoiled little princess too.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  She's just totally spoilt.
L:  Yeah, what do you do to spoil her?
R:  I just always pat her and she goes everywhere with me and I talk to her like she's a child and give her special things and, um, she understands a lot of different words and she has toys and I always just show her lots of love and affection and, you know ...
L:  Yeah, that sounds like our do- [LAUGH] sounds like what we do with ours.  They have little special treats that they -- every time they go out and come back in they get a little -- it's almost like a little rice bone --
