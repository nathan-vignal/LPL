R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.  This is Candice.
R:  Hi.  This is Amy.  Um, Candice, where are you from?
L:  I'm from uh Georgia.
R:  Okay.  I'm from Virginia, so we're not too far apart.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Um, I was just curious how you got on this call?
L:  Um, I found it on a website.
R:  And what website was that?
L:  Uh, Freelance By U.
R:  Oh, okay.  Me too.  That is [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
R:  That is so [LAUGH] weird because I was reading the newsletter yesterday and it happened --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and Angie happened to say how she got on with another Freelancer also.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I am actually, um -- I live near Angie.  I've known Angie for a long time.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So um yeah.  I -- um -- um, yeah, I just saw Angie just last weekend.  That is just -- that's -- that's really good.  Okay.  Pets.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.
R:  Um, let's see.  I have one dog.  We have two cats and we have seven kittens.  
L:  Yeah.  I just have one cat.  And um [LAUGH] --
R:  She lives in- --
L:  -- and he stays --
R:  And she's inside with you?
L:  He's inside at night --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and outside during the day because I have a baby and he doesn't get along with the baby.
R:  Oh, yes.  
L:  So [LAUGH].
R:  I ha- I have a baby, too.  We actually had to get rid of our inside cat.  I have three kids and she never really got along with any of uh -- my second child was very um -- would pick her up by her head and things like that and drag her --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- around by her tail, so um we had to get rid of our inside cat.  Um, well my dog is an Alaskan Malamute and she actually stays outside and she's actually my husband's, so um I really don't have anything to do with her because she -- she pretty much scares me.  She's about a hundred and twenty five pounds.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, every time I look out there or go out there, I feel like she wants to eat me or something like that and um we have two -- like I say, we have two cats and they both just had kittens so um we have seven kittens between the two of 'em and they're at the -- the age right now where they're really cute.  They're about four weeks old and they're all out there jumping around and playing and um so really, the only time I spend with -- with any of 'em are pretty much the -- the cats and especially the kittens right now.  
L:  Mm.  Ha.  Well, we -- we'd like to get another um pet, but I don't know.  Cats are nice 'cause they can, you know, um --
R:  Self sufficient.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You really don't have to teach them or uh you -- well, yeah, it's very nice to have an animal that will all of a sudden just, you know, go to the litter box and you don't have to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  All you have to do is just show them where it is.  Um, we've had -- my -- my husband's a big pet man.  I mean, he would have snakes and all kinds of stuff in here if he could, but um, my daughter had a hamster and the hamster wasn't a bit hit here.  Um, and we had a dog a while back and she proceeded to eat our -- our new deck.  She ate --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- our kitchen table.  She ate our vinyl floor.  Um, and that was the last straw with me.  We ended up having to replace our floor, so um --
L:  [MN].
R:  -- I'm -- I'm more of a cat person or a -- or a smaller dog person.
L:  Yeah.  We had a -- for a little while, we had a part German Shepherd and she ate all kinds of things, too.  But um like, those gnarler bones, you know?  She could eat one of those in about ten minutes.
R:  Right.
L:  And they're supposed to be, like, really hard and [LAUGH] stuff, so --
R:  Yeah.  Ah, we ha- wha- um she was a -- I'm just kinda drawing blank what she was.  Um, but she proceeded -- I mean, she ate our kitchen table, all the chairs and when I saw she ate 'em, you know that rod that goes through the middle?  She totally -- it was gone.
L:  Oh, my gosh.  Huh.
R:  She ate um the window sills.  I have bite marks on our window sills.  She um ate quite a few rungs on the deck.  It was awful.  She was just bad.  But my husband just had to have her.  She was a um -- oh, if it comes to me I'll tell you what she is.  Big white dog.  But my husband had always wanted one and then um we finally got her.  I want to say we had her for maybe six months, but when she ate that, I just -- I had had enough.  I said I couldn't do it any more.  But she was really good with the kids and um -- I mean, all my -- all my animals are really good with the kids.  Surprisingly, the Malamute's very good with kids.  Um, we've had her um -- we've had her for about four years now and she's very -- she's -- she's huge, but she's very lovable.  Um, like I say, she's my husband's dog.  I don't feed her 'cause like sort of I feel like I go outside and want -- she wants to eat me or something like that.
L:  Mm.
R:  But she's -- she does have to stay um in a fence and we actually have to have her in an electric fence because --
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- she is so big, it scares our neighbors and um so and -- and our neighbors have horses and she likes to go out and run with the horses, but um, yeah, ever since we've -- ever since we've had her, she -- she's very intimidating looking.  Um, a hundred and twenty five pounds.  I mean --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- I -- I weigh just about that, so it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's very um -- she's just very scary to me looking.  Uh, she's kinda like a wolf breed but yeah, she is --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- she is pure Malamute, but um she's just very scary to [LAUGH] me.  Uh, she -- we did just get rabbits.  She did get out the other day and she tried to eat the rabbit cage.
L:  Hm.
R:  So I had to go out there and uh catch her before she ate my rabbits.
L:  Yeah.  I had a rabbit that got ate before so --
R:  Well, we had rabbits --
L:  They can --
R:  -- when I was yo- we had rabbits when I was younger.  Um, and we just got our children -- we have three.  We just got our girls rabbits for Easter. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's amazing how small they were when we got 'em and how big they are, just from Easter --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- now.  But those are generally -- that's all the pets we have.  We had fish.  They don't last very long.
L:  Yes.  I used to have fish, too [LAUGH].
R:  They're very flushable.  But like I said, if my husband could have, yeah, anything, he'd have a snake and I told him he could have a snake, but he wasn't living here.  Um that's one thing I'm terribly afraid of.  He used to own a pet store so um he thinks snakes are babies.  You know, "Oh, they cute little babies".
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  "No, they're not".  Um, so -- is this your first call that you've done?
L:  Yes.  Mhm.
R:  So you just signed up for it generally last night or something like that?
L:  What's that?
R:  Did you generally just sign up for it last night or --
L:  Yeah.  And I wasn't expecting one so soon, so --
R:  I wasn't either, when I um -- when my -- when the caller I.D. put up, I was like, "What in the world is this?" and I didn't realize --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- oh, it is right about two.
L:  What does it say?
R:  Um, University of -- oh, gosh, what did it say?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  University of Phoenix or University of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Connecticut, university of something.  'Cause it comes up over my T.V.  If I'm watching T.V. I can see who calls.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  I have um direct T.V.  But yeah, I just -- I had just signed up for it.  I want to say I signed up for it about ten o'clock last night.  It was late.  But I wasn't expecting anything so soon either.  And I think it's very funny that um --
L:  [NOISE].
R:  -- it's another Freelancer, too.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I'm sure it's gonna be um full of the -- the program.
R:  I would think so, too.  Um, how long have you been um -- well, how -- how long have you been getting the mailings for Freelance?
L:  Um, I found out about it probably over a year ago.
R:  So you've gotten some really good deals through there?
L:  Yeah.  I have.  
R:  That's good.  I mean, I generally just started, but um -- 'cause I didn't really put two and two together --
L:  [NOISE].
R:  -- for a long time, with Angie.  Um, but I've -- I've known her daughters for a long time.  And um then --
L:  [NOISE].
R:  -- one of my friends kept telling me, "Sign up, sign up, sign up", and it was like finally, I was like, "Okay, I will".  
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  And um just the things that I've gotten -- the -- did you get the craft box?
L:  Yes, I did.
R:  I actually got two.  Um, we actually have two physical addresses, so I was able to get two of them and I thought that was just so awesome.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And now I'm uh everybody in my family wants me to order one.  "Tell us when they're open again.  Tell us, please".
L:  I know.  I have friends that -- that um don't have computers.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so sometimes I'll tell them about stuff and they'll go, "Oh, get me -- get me one", you know?
R:  "Get it for me".
L:  So --
R:  Yeah.  I have all these order -- all the craft orders that everybody wants me to get for 'em.  Um, but I just couldn't believe -- I mean, my friend called me, she's like, "You will not believe what's in the box", it's like, "Yeah, yeah, whatever", and then I got the box and it's like, "Oh my gosh".  I was calling everybody I knew.  "Oh, you're not going to believe what's in this box".  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  It was a -- it's amazing.  
L:  I got a um -- the scanner, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- flatbed scanner for twenty five dollars, off Amazon dot com.  
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Pretty nice.  
R:  That -- I mean, it's just --
L:  That's --
R:  -- some of the stuff that comes across --
L:  -- one of my favorite ones.  [LAUGH].  
R:  -- there is just crazy.  Yeah.  I keep um -- I mean, I look forward to my email every day --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just to look and see -- yeah, what's -- what's hot.  Um --
