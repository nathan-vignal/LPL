L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, this is Nicola.
L:  Hi, my name is Roger.
R:  Hi, Roger, how are you?
L:  I'm fine.  Where are you, Nicola?
R:  I'm in Dallas, Texas.
L:  You're in Dallas, but you're accent tells me you're from somewhere else.
R:  [LAUGH] It gives it away, doesn't it, Roger? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, you're from, uh, well, let's see, I'm going to guess, uh, England.
R:  That's right.
L:  Whereabouts in England?
R:  Up -- er, from Yorkshire, up in the north east of England.
L:  Yorkshire?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I've been to York and, uh, I've been to England, the UK very -- quite a few times --
R:  Oh, great, I'm --
L:  -- in my travels.
R:  -- glad to hear that, uh -- uh --
L:  Yeah, I'm in -- go ahead --
R:  -- and where are you, Roger?
L:  I'm in Minnesota.
R:  Oh, right.
L:  Directly north of you, so --
R:  Absolutely, all the way up there.
L:  -- yeah.  Are you, uh -- h- -- what do you think about a lifetime partner?
R:  Well, I just got married about six weeks ago, so --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I should say that I think it's an important thing to have. [LAUGH]
L:  Absolutely.  Well, I've been --
R:  I --
L:  -- I've been married forty two years, so --
R:  Forty two years, well, I guess you've got some insight on that -- that, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- situation, then.
L:  Well, that's true, it -- it, uh, took two marriages though, uh, my second marriage has been the one that, uh -- if the first one hadn't have failed I would have never been able to meet, uh, the woman I've been married to for forty two years, so --
R:  So, that's a blessing.
L:  That's right, that's right.
R:  Yeah.  I -- this is my second marriage as well and I tell my husband that it's good for me to have the practice run, but not for him. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] No, he hasn't been married before, huh?
R:  No, he hasn't --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- this is his one and only, we hope.
L:  Oh, okay.  And you, uh -- you work outside the home, or you a homemaker, or what?
R:  Um, no, actually I work from home --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so it's, uh -- it's kind of nice, I get to be at home with the dog, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- on the phone most of the day and it gives me the de- -- flexibility to do things like this.
L:  Right.  W- --
R:  So, tell me, in your forty two years of marriage, what are the m- most important things that you've found?
L:  Well, I think, uh, actually you mellow out after a while and it's -- it's, uh, listening and, uh, being patient and, uh, I think it's understanding, because, uh, we have a tendency, you know, to try to mold people into our own characteristics and what have you and, uh, you have to always remember that there's two different personalities and, uh, two -- two different people.
R:  Yeah.  It's hard as well, I think, the older you get -- if you haven't found somebody --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, then you're definitely a bit more set in your own ways and perhaps a little less flexible.
L:  I would -- I would say that th- those, uh, that get married later on in life, uh, for the first time that -- that is, uh, probably very difficult, because, uh, you have your own, uh, you know -- your own ways of -- of living and so on and so forth and it's very hard to adjust yourself.
R:  Yeah, I was -- I was, um, just twenty when I got married the first time --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I was definitely a lot more willing to put up with rubbish --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, uh, now I'm thirty three and absolutely won't --
L:  Well --
R:  -- so I hope that it gives us a more healthy relationship this time around.
L:  Yeah.  How -- how did you meet your -- your hubby?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, I met him in a restaurant.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Just saw him and started talking and then we found out, um, we had a mutual friend, which was quite amazing, in another city --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, uh, just -- just started talking like that.  It was funny because I don't think, uh, there was a huge physical attraction for either of us --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it was [MN] just a -- a really nice person to talk to --
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  -- and that developed into something deeper --
L:  Well, I think that --
R:  -- which, perhaps, is why I hope it's going to work. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I, uh -- I get good vibes -- I think it will.  I -- I think that, uh, uh, a little bit later on, uh, in life too you -- you -- you tend to look not for the glamor end --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of it because, uh, [NOISE] while I don't consider marriage a drudge, don't misunderstand me, it -- it's not all glamor and -- and what have you.  Do you anticipate having any children?
R:  Yes, probably in a couple of years --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- my husband's doing a graduate degree at the moment --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and we both work full time, so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [SIGH] we want to wait for that and enjoy being married for a few years --
L:  Right.
R:  -- till our time runs out -- [LAUGH] till our window -- when our window shrinks to the minimum, that's when we'll try and take the opportunity.
L:  Do you -- do you share a lot of likes, uh, lot of the same things, like travel or --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, we d- --
L:  -- stuff like that or --
R:  -- yeah, we do, uh, we're actu- -- we're very different people, but we have very similar morals and core values --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- which, I think, are so important to making it work, because you can be, you know, different personality styles, but if your values are -- are similar then it gives you a -- a greater strength in a relationship.
L:  Yeah.  Do you -- do you, uh -- do you feel like, uh, religion, uh, is a factor, er, uh, believing in something --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- in having beliefs in --
R:  In -- in our situation, no, I don't believe it is --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I think it is for some people in --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- in Europe, while most -- most people are Christian --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's just something you're born into and i- -- church is not as big a deal in Europe as it is here in America, particularly here in the South.
L:  Well, yeah, you're down in the Baptist Bible belt down there.
R:  Yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, um -- and my husband was brought up Catholic and went to Catholic school but --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- he, um -- I think we both believe we should have deep spirituality --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but not necessarily believe the same thing.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  We, uh, uh -- we came from, uh, uh -- I was a divorced heretic and my wife was Roman Catholic and, uh --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- uh, we found all that, uh -- we were able to overcome those -- those kind of, uh, manmade, uh, differences, you know?
R:  Yeah, they are manmade.
L:  Yeah.  We -- we, uh -- we are active in a group called Alpha though, which is, uh -- started in London, uh, through the Anglican church, which was probably as close to dying as any church in the world, uh, but, uh th- the -- all of a sudden they got a fever and now, uh the Anglicans have sponsored this Alpha thing and it's -- it's spread to a lot of the mainline, uh, uh, churches and as well as the Baptists even and, uh, they follow this Alpha program and -- and, uh, the growth has been really great.  So, we --
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  -- uh, were involved in that and, uh, we hope to get back to London some day and -- and, uh, uh, go visit the home church, which is, uh, Trinity, uh, Brompton -- Brom- -- yeah, Trinity, Brompton in, uh, Kensington, uh --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- part of London.
R:  On Brompton Road?
L:  Yes, yeah.  Not too far from, uh, Hyde Park and, uh --
R:  Right --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- just down from Hyde Park --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, uh, near the, um [LIPSMACK] -- near all of the museums.
L:  Right, Prince Albert and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so on and so forth.  You know the turf then?
R:  Yeah, yeah --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- in fact, I used to live in Kensington, for a while.
L:  Did you, did you?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  So -- and of course, you know, in England every corner you walk around there's a pub on one corner and a church on the other one. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right and, uh, i- -- the churches, uh, managed to get five to ten people in them, you know, at -- at different times.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, as they say, this -- this church is, uh -- not only has, uh, grown itself, but it's, uh, spawned -- that's -- that's probably the wrong word to use -- but it's -- it's started up before other separate churches in -- in various, uh, boroughs of London that, uh, where the churches have died out and stuff like that.  So --
R:  Oh, that's good.  It --
L:  Yeah, it -- it -- it has an appeal, while I'm, uh, uh, sixty nine years old, uh, it does have an appeal for young people in particular.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, that's good.
R:  Now, have you found, when you've had challenges in your relationship that having that joint spiritual connection has helped you?
L:  Oh, yes, absolutely and, uh, uh, at our age, uh, we -- we do things, like, we'll do a morning devotion -- stuff I never thought I'd ever do when I was thirty -- thirty years old or --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- thirty five.  And, uh, it's -- it's a little harder to stay mad at each other for, you know, more --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- than three weeks at a time -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- than instead of, uh, six months at a time --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- no, I'm exaggerating, but it really is hard to stay mad at each other if you start out, uh, uh, you know, your day with, uh, kind of sharing something and some thoughts -- stuff like that.
R:  That's a good point --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it -- it makes you kind of sit and take stock and go, "Okay, this is a little -- little ridiculous perhaps" if you're going to be mad.
L:  Gotcha, gotcha.
R:  Well, wow.
L:  Uh, for the first time in my life I'm at a loss for words here, I'm trying to think of what, uh, we're talk- -- how about family, uh -- your family's in England?
R:  [LIPSMACK] My family's all in England --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um, Ryan's family is in Louisiana --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and we're here in Dallas --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I anticipate, probably some kind of challenge but not a huge negative challenge when we do have children, because --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I think I'll want to be closer to my family --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [MN] -- I have a large family and everybody's there.
L:  Uh-huh.  H- --
R:  [SIGH] So, it, uh --
L:  -- how did you wind up in -- how did you wind up in Texas?
R:  Ex husband.
L:  Ex husband who --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- dragged you down there, huh?
R:  Ex husband dragged me --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to Texas --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- made me live in the suburbs for five years, [MN] uh --
L:  So you live -- I'm g- -- I'm got vibrations, I think you live in Plano.
R:  Oh, you know what, I did, but now I live in the city --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- and I live really close to downtown.
L:  You're in town, huh?
R:  Yeah, close to the --
L:  Well --
R:  -- close to the lake.
L:  I was just wondering about acceptance of -- of your family of your -- of your present spouse, uh, which is not probably as important as it used to be, but it's still a factor.  Uh, have they had a chance to meet him yet?
R:  Oh, absolutely.  They met --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- him, um, a few times.  We went to England and had the wedding in England --
L:  Oh, wonderful.
R:  -- and my family loves him, his mother --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, [MN] finally got the four daughters she never had --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so she's very happy to -- to be involved in my family --
L:  Good, good.
R:  -- and w- -- I'm very fortunate because my -- my mom is a very open, liberal woman --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so, in fact, she was saying, "Oh, you know, you've been married once, why do it again --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- just live together". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
