R:  Michael Cozar.  [NOISE]
L:  Hello?
R:  You there?
L:  Hi, I'm Sasha.
R:  Hi, Sasha.  I'm Michael.
L:  Michael?
R:  Yes, I'm Michael.  Sorry, I have a cold.  So, bear with me.
L:  That's okay.
R:  [COUGH] So, tell me about your pet.
L:  I actually don't have a pet.  My Dad's not a big fan of dogs and so I never grew up with one.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  How 'bout you?
R:  I have four cats.
L:  Wow!  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I have Bonaparte and Horashio and Blackie and Charlotte.  Hello?
L:  Yes.  How -- how many -- how long do you spend playing with them a day?  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, let's see.  Um, I play with them probably a lot through the day 'cause right now I'm -- I'm just in and out of work right now.
L:  Do you ...?
R:  So, I have a lotta time to spend with my pets.
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH]  Do you like dogs also or not?
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yes.  I have, um -- my girlfriend's sister has two dogs --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and they're really cute.  They're Pit Bulls.
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]  Do they bite?
R:  No.  No.  They're -- they're, um, babies.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, you have no pets at all or what?
L:  We have fish at home, but I'm a college student.  So, I don't really live at home.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you have no pets at all then?
L:  No.  We're not allowed to have pets in the dorm.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's sad.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  I like -- I -- I like my cats 'cause they're got good personalities.  They're very intelligent.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well together cats.  Yeah.  They're all ...
L:  Doesn't it get crowded --
R:  I'm --
L:  -- with four cats?
R:  -- I'm sorry.  Go ahead.
L:  Does it get crowded with four cats?
R:  Oh, no, not at all --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and two dogs.  No, not at all.
L:  That's insane.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  My dogs, um -- my -- my girlfriend's dogs are -- are her sister's dogs are really playful and really lovable and we just got 'em about a week ago --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and, uh, they're really cool.
L:  They don't fight with the cats at all?
R:  Oh, no, they play with the little baby, Charlotte.
L:  Wow!
R:  They play with her a lot --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and, uh, they play with each other and, uh, they go outside a lot [LIPSMACK] and, um, there's a lot about -- about 'em.  They're really cool.
L:  That's cool.
R:  You know?  Um, let's see.  What else?  Um ...
L:  [LAUGH] How long have you had them?  Did you tell me that?
R:  Oh, yeah.  No, I haven't told you yet.
L:  You haven't.
R:  Um, I got them from my parents in Palmdale [LIPSMACK] and, um, my Mom and Dad they had too many cats.  So ...
L:  [NOISE] I'm sorry?
R:  I'm sorry.  Where are you at?
L:  Oh, I'm actually ...
R:  Are you at work?
L:  No, I'm at the bookstore though and they're closing soon.  So, they talked ...  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, oh, oh, that's interesting.
L:  It's okay.
R:  Um ...
L:  So, you got them from your parents?
R:  Yeah, I got 'em from my parents, um, my Mom baby fed them from a bottle --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you know, they were all given to her by kids in the neighborhood and, you know, she loves cats so she'd take them all in and she takes care of 'em, but then when they're grown cats they don't want nothing to do with her anymore --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- or, you know, she doesn't want anything to do with them really.  But she doesn't wanna 'em to go to bad homes.  So, she asked my girlfriend and me to take 'em.  So, we did.
L:  That's nice.  [LAUGH]
R:  You know?  They're really cool cats though.  They have personalities.  They're always trying to run out the door and we don't want 'em outside and then Blackie's always trying to run out the door.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know?  But, you know -- you know how it is?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Pets can be a pain in the butt, but then they can be great animals at the same time.
L:  Yeah.  Definitely.  [LAUGH]
R:  You know?  So, um, let's see.  What else?  Um, they're like about -- about two years old.
L:  Is that young or old for cats?
R:  Um, well, they're still young, but they're not old, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  They're, um -- they're like really feisty and real happy and everything and, um, they, um [LIPSMACK] -- they're good cats.  That's all I can say.  You know?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, are there any kinda animals that you like?  [NOISE]
L:  Um, I don't know.  My boyfriend actually has -- oh, what does he have?  He has a Pug and some other kinda dog and -- and they're growing on me.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, really?  What kinda dogs?
L:  Um [LIPSMACK], one of them is a Pug and I don't know what the other one is.  Schnautz maybe.
R:  A what?  I'm sorry.
L:  A Schnautz.  I'm not sure.
R:  Oh, those are cool dogs.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, that's good.  Once you're around the dogs a lot you'll get attached to 'em.
L:  Yeah, that's what happens.  [LAUGH]
R:  That's how it usually happens.  Um [LIPSMACK], let's see.  What else?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I like all animals, you know?  I spend a lotta time with my animals.  They're attached to me and my one kitten sleeps on my chest.
L:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH]
R:  It's r- -- it's -- it's cool.  Yeah.  They sleep on my chest and stuff and they sleep next to me and sometimes I have all of 'em just surrounding me while I'm sleeping.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Sometimes I have to wake up in the middle of the night and say, "What the heck!  All these cats", you know, and push them all away from me [LAUGH] so I can get a decent night's sleep, you know?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Do cats shed at all?
R:  Um, these are short haired cats.  Not really.  I mean, they do a little bit on the rug, but not really on our blankets or anything like that, not really.
L:  Mm.
R:  They're just -- they're just cool cats.  That's all.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um [LIPSMACK], let's see.  What else?  Um, any other kinda pets that you like?
L:  Um [MN], uh, I guess I would have a koala if I could.  [LAUGH]
R:  A koala?  You mean like ...?
L:  [LAUGH] They're pretty cool.
R:  Yeah, that sounds cool.  I mean, people have ferrets, so, I mean, a koala seems pretty cool.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  If I could have a -- if I could have any other kinda pet I'd probably want a black panther, a white panther too.
L:  Yeah.  Would they fight with your cats or not?
R:  Probably [LAUGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- 'cause they're big, you know?  But ...
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  So ...
L:  It's funny how long ten minutes is.  [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  Sometimes you don't know what to talk about.  But I love my pets.  But there's only --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so much you can say about 'em, you know?
L:  Yeah.  Let's see.  I'm trying to think.  Monkeys are cool.  I know people that have had pet monkeys.
R:  Oh, yeah?  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  What kind of, uh, monkeys?
L:  I'm honestly not sure.  [LAUGH]  But I know -- I know they're pretty cool.
R:  Yeah.  I know people who have pigs.
L:  Oh, yeah.  That I've heard of too.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, pigs in -- in apartments.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Clean pigs at that.  Um, let's see.  Um, I like to watch America's Funniest Pets.  Those -- that's a cool show.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I also like to watch a lotta the history channel too and national geographic as well.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's pretty interesting and I like to watch to that kinda stuff.
L:  Sometimes I watch the, uh -- the surgeries on the pet channel, you know?  I don't know what it's called.  The animals channel.
R:  The pet channel?
L:  Yeah.  The animal channel is that what it's called?
R:  Yeah.  That's -- that's one of the channels.
L:  Yeah, and sometimes they do like surgeries on animals.  So, sometimes that's kinda cool.  [LAUGH]
R:  It's amazing.  It's amazing how, um -- how they can save an animal's life, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That -- that is cool.  I like that.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I like watching, um -- have you ever watched Full House before?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  You know their, um -- the -- Danny, the father?

L:  Oh, okay.
R:  That's a good show.
L:  Yeah.  He's pretty cool.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It's pretty cool.  I like it.  You know, they -- they make pets do amazing things.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, my pets they climb up on the screens and climb up on the curtains and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- play with the screen and -- and they do all kinds of crazy stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, you know, that's cool.  I think it.
L:  Mhm.  [LAUGH]
R:  You know?  So, uh -- you ever had a cat before?
L:  No, I've never had a cat.  But I had a friend who had cats and she really liked them.
R:  Yeah, they make good companions, you know?  They sleep with you.  They wake up with you if they're small cats, you know?  I had a cat named Squeaky one time, all white, real beautiful cat --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, um, I had to go away for a little while and, uh, my parents were supposed to hold him for me and they ended up giving him away when I came back and I was like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- really sad about it.  He used to ride on my bike with me on my shoulders --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- and sleep -- sleep on my neck.  He was -- he was cool, you know?
L:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH]
R:  I really liked that.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, what else?  Uh, I had a dog named Samson, a Pit Bull.
