R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, my name's Amy.
L:  Hi, Amy.  My name is Delia.  
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  
R:  Um, I have --
L:  Do --
R:  -- a cat.
L:  Me, too.  
R:  Oh.
L:  What kind of cat do you have?
R:  Um, a Persian.
L:  I have a Calico.
R:  Oh, that's cool.  Yeah.
L:  What color is your Persian cat?  
R:  She's a um -- she's grey and white.  What color's yours?
L:  She's gorgeous, actually.
R:  Mm?
L:  She has these incredibly big green eyes.
R:  Wow.
L:  And she's white and black and --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- like burnt orange.
R:  Mm.
L:  But what's amazing about her colors is that the black part, like, black is on her face, but it covers her nose and it looks like she has no nose.
R:  Really?
L:  It's -- it is so incredible.
R:  Oh.  My cat has um one blue eye and one, like, golden eye.
L:  Really?
R:  Totally different color eyes.  Yeah.
L:  Is it a boy or girl?
R:  It's a girl.
L:  How old is she?
R:  She's about two years old.
L:  Mine is, I think, four.  
R:  Wow.
L:  And I found out not too long ago, after spending seventy five dollars, that she is asthmatic.  
R:  Oh.
L:  Is your cat asthmatic?
R:  No.  I haven't had no problems.  She's sexed and declawed --
L:  You know what?  Mine is fixed and declawed in the front and not declawed in the back.
R:  Wow.  Yeah, that's the way mine is.  [MN].  Yeah, 'cause she was -- when she -- we got her when she was a kitten.  Mm.
L:  Now, I have a question for you.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Does your cat talk a lot?
R:  Sometimes.  Usually only when she wants food.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  When she's hungry.
L:  My cat is the most typical female that I've ever come across --
R:  Really?
L:  -- because she talks and talks and talks.
R:  Oh, really?  Yeah, sometimes like if I'm sleeping in the morning, she'll come and wake me up, but it's --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- usually just wants food.  Only when she wants food.  
L:  Actually, Kiki is -- her name is Kiki.  What's your cat's name?
R:  Fluffy.
L:  Fluffy?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Kiki I think is like an amazing cat.
R:  Mm.
L:  Where there was one night -- first of all --
R:  Mm?
L:  -- she really likes to talk, which is incredible because the moment she gets quiet, I get very concerned.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  But --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- there was one morning where I was dead asleep --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- and all of a sudden, she started crying out.
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  And you know by a cat owner that your cat has very distinctive --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  -- meow --
R:  She does.
L:  -- so I woke up immediately just because of her crying.
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  And what was going on was there was a big bug on the wall.
R:  Oh.
L:  And she was over there just like a dog would be --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- like, you know, up on the wall?
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  And she was pointing with her paw.
R:  Ah.
L:  I thought it was amazing.  So I woke up and I --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I gave her treats and I killed of course the bug, but I gave her --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- treats for letting me know because I would of hated it if the thing flew on my face and then I freaked out.
R:  Oh, my.
L:  But I thought --
R:  Yes, that's cool. 
L:  I thought that was amazing.
R:  Yeah.  She -- she chases flies around here crazy, oh my.  She --
L:  Does your --
R:  -- bats at 'em, mhm.
L:  Does your cat um -- is your cat afraid of thunder, or of the rain?
R:  No, she don't really -- she usually sleeps a lot.  She's been sleeping a lot and she is, like, sleeps --
L:  I know.  Aren't cats so lazy?
R:  Yeah.  Oh, my gosh.  Um, yeah.  But every time, like, I lay on the couch, she'll come up and like lay right beside me.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  My cat --
R:  She loves me.
L:  My cat this morning, I way -- I laid kinda funny on um --
R:  'Cause she has --
L:  -- my Futon and she came up and pressed herself as hard as she could to my back.  [LAUGH].
R:  Wow.  She knows I'm talking about here.  She's right here, at me.  [LAUGH].  But yeah, she -- now, my husband, he don't -- she don't come around.  Like, if you're sitting in a chair, she won't come up to him as much, but if I'm laying on the couch, she'll be -- come right up next to me.  Sit on my lap.  And um it's good though.
L:  And in fact, just as a side note, did you -- when -- do you live in an apartment or in a house?
R:  In an apartment.
L:  In an apart- yeah, me too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I wasn't able -- the pet deposit here is three hundred dollars.
R:  Wow.
L:  So I snuck my cat in.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And any time maintenance comes over, I have to hide all of her stuff.
R:  Yeah?  Wow.  No, that's really -- they let us have pets here 'cause it's a [inaudible] but um yeah, that's sounds pretty neat.  Mm.
L:  And in fact right now I'm uh have to hide in the bathroom because there's somebody wanting to come in and I'm afraid --
R:  Oh, no.  I had that --
L:  -- the cat's going to run outside.
R:  -- before -- I had that problem before.
L:  And let them know that --
R:  I had a -- I had a -- 
L:  -- she's here.
R:  I had to hid a cat before.  Oh.  Just -- yeah, it won't meow all the time.  But that's -- yeah.  It's not too bad.  Does yours look out the window a lot?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh.
L:  She does look out the window a lot.
R:  I know.  So does mine.  'Cause there's, like, lots of cats out on the front porch and she talks to 'em and stuff.
L:  Do you ever let your cat out?
R:  No.  Indoors.
L:  She's an indoor cat?
R:  Yeah.  Is yours?
L:  Mine is an indoor cat.  I can't -- with her declawed in the front, I am not at all --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- comfortable letting her --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- go outside.
R:  Yeah.  [MN].  Mhm.
L:  The funny thing is, though --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- is that -- or the great thing is, is that --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- she's more interested in birds --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and looking out the window and stuff at other cats.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Thankfully, though, she does not -- she's not at all interested in um going out.
R:  Oh.
L:  Which re- is one time I opened the door --
R:  Mhm.
L:  One time I opened the door and she darted out, like she --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- knew where she was going.
R:  Wow.  Well, ours is -- does a pretty good job staying in.  Like, if I open the door to the hallway, so, "Show me out, I wanna be out", but she'll stay in mostly.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Do you have any pet -- any, like, dogs or anything else --
R:  No.
L:  -- that your cat and her --
R:  I have fish.  Just fish.  
L:  Just the cat?
R:  And a goldfish.
L:  Oh, a goldfish?
R:  Like aquarium, yeah.  I have an aquarium.  Do you have a dog or --
L:  I don't.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I have a sister.  [LAUGH].  That's usually what I tell people.  I have a cat and I have a sister.
R:  That's pretty good.  No, we can't have dogs here.  We can just have like -- like cats.  
L:  You know what?
R:  Yeah.
L:  My apartment is really small.
R:  So is mine.
L:  I would love to have a dog.
R:  So is mine.
L:  But because it's so small, it just would not accommodate --
R:  Yeah, same here.  
L:  -- the size of a dog.
R:  Wow.  That's cool.  Yeah, we like live in a one bedroom apartment.  
L:  I have an efficiency.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  And it's perfect for one --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- animal, but --
R:  That's good.
L:  -- and I would love -- I be -- because I feel like I have enough love for more pets.
R:  Oh.
L:  But because it's -- I only have enough room for me and the cat --
R:  I know what you mean.
L:  -- I can't really bring in another pet.
R:  I love Golden Retrievers.  They're my favorite dog, but I just can't have one.  I don't know.  I tried having one in an apartment -- or in a trailer before, but oh, he -- too -- too big for that.
L:  You know what?  I have a friend that also lives in a trailer, but --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- he's got a really small dog.
R:  Wow.
L:  And for the one -- it's a wiener dog.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And for the wiener dog, it's just perfect.
R:  Yeah, that would be good.  [COUGH].  I mean, I like small -- small dogs.  Huh.  That's cool.
L:  But in fact, it's about to rain here and Kiki um just decided to go dig her -- well, she saw me walking by and decided to follow me into the -- into --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- the bathroom, but -- I'm sitting in the bathroom having a conversation with you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- with the cat next to me.  Just because there was somebody knocking on my door and I didn't want to be interrupted.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But Kiki --
R:  My cat's uh chasing flies here.  That's what she's doing.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Yeah.  Kiki saw me run past and decided she was gonna follow me.
R:  She tries to kill 'em, yeah.  She loves chasing flies.  Has yours ever caught a mouse before?
L:  No, she hasn't, but not too long ago, I went out and I bought her um --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- I bought her a um -- one of those like stuffed --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- mouse.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  One time I caught her playing with it --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and the only time I caught her playing with it, she was walking across the apartment with the mouse in her mouth.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  And it was so cute.
R:  Oh.  
L:  But ever since then, that was --
R:  That's cool.
L:  -- really the only time I've ever seen her play with the mouse.
R:  Wow.  Mm.  You know uh when we lived in a trailer, she did actually catch a mouse, and oh my gosh.  I was surprised.  That's when she was clawed.  I was -- I was, like, wow, my gosh and like, "You're so good you caught that".  Huh.  That's good.
L:  When your cat -- I'm curious.  When your cat caught the mouse, did she come up and bring it?
R:  No, she was like started like -- it was like not -- I don't know if it was all the way dead, but she just had it hanging in her mouth, you know?  She didn't, like, know what to do with it, I guess.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  She was sort of like holding it in her mouth, yeah.  I don't know if it was dead.
L:  How did she find the mouse?
R:  I have no idea.  I think it was a baby one.  It wasn't, like, a big one.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah and I just -- oh, here she's batting at flies.
L:  [MN].
R:  She loves that, yeah.  Anything that moves, they like.  I don't know.
L:  Yeah, Kiki's -- Kiki's really into that too.
R:  Well, you had less of a mouse problem, now, haven't you, since you've had a cat?
L:  Well, you know what?  I've never had a -- I've never had an issue really with like mice or anything --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in the apartment, knock on wood.  Just the one time where she --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- well, in the last night actually she alerted me to a tiny small bug.  
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, we -- we've had like less, less mice since we've gotten her.  'Cause she -- like, they get scared away.  Mice can smell a cat and it gets scared away.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  So we've had no problem.  So glad.  Ah, I'm -- uh-huh.
L:  Well, the rain now is pouring.  I'm surprised --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- my cat -- yeah --
R:  It's been raining --
L:  -- Kiki and I are in the bathroom.
R:  Cool.
L:  She cannot see out the window.
R:  Oh.
L:  If she did, she would be freaking out because she does not like rain.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  She can't stand the rain.
R:  What does she do, cry?
L:  Say that again?
R:  So does she cry when it rains?
L:  Um, she -- she doesn't cry.  She shakes.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And it --
