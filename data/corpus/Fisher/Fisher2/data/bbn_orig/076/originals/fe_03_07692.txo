R:  Hello?
L:  [NOISE] Hello.
R:  Hi.  [LAUGH]
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  Good.
L:  My name's Brian.
R:  Oh, my name is Alanna.
L:  Hi, Alanna.
R:  Nice to meet you.  [LAUGH]
L:  Good to meet you.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, I have a cold so please bear with me.
R:  Oh, I'm sorry.
L:  Oh, that's okay.  [SIGH]
R:  So, what do you think is the most important quality in a life partner?
L:  Oh.  [SIGH] Definitely compatibility.
R:  Yeah, I -- that actually was going to be my first number one answer as well.
L:  I think if you can kinda --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- understand what each other is thinking and feeling --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] you know, having to go with compatibility then definitely it -- it tends to work out much better.
R:  Oh, yeah.  
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I think you -- you need someone who -- to an extent can almost anticipate -- if not anticipate, you know, your reactions to things and, you know, how some things gonna affect you --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- so that they can sort of predict like to -- to, um, phrase something in a way that is specifically for you or, you know, to give you support in a particular kind of way.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause I think all too often, I mean, me personally, I -- I find myself sometimes, if I'm in a relationship [SIGH] where I'm expecting someone to act a certain way and they're not and then it always leaves me guessing, you know, "Okay --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- so why are they not, you know, reacting how I would assume that they would react?"
R:  Right.
L:  You know, and -- and I think if you're compatible with someone, you can almost anticipate, you know, how they're going to react and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it almost becomes an expectation.
R:  Right and it's so much more comfortable to be with someone like that.
L:  Sure.
R:  Because if you're not sure how they're gonna react or, you know, what -- wh- wh- where their lines are that you might cross [LAUGH] --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- that, you know, you're always kind of on edge and tiptoeing around.  
L:  [SIGH]
R:  That's not a good relationship.  [LAUGH]
L:  No.  [LAUGH]
R:  It's usually one sided.  One or the other.
L:  What do you think -- what else do you think is important?
R:  Um, I think [MN] a limited number.  I mean, you don't have to have everything in common but you have to have some things in common that you can enjoy together or appreciate together or at least have, you know, a meaningful conversation about [SIGH] --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- but I don't think you have to be necessarily, you know, have all the same interests because then you'd probably be bored.
L:  Right.
R:  I think it's good for one person, you know -- for each person to have a few things that are kind of their thing and they can h- um, help i- introduce it to the other person but it also still their thing and, you know, it [MN] helps them be still an independent person while being in a codependent relationship. 
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Exactly.  I -- and I agree with you that all relationships are codependent.
R:  I think so.  Or all good ones.  [LAUGH]
L:  E- exactly.  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean it too, you know, not to the pathological term [LAUGH] of codependence.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't know if it -- I guess it can be bad but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I think, uh, I mean, [MN] to have a real relationship you have to depend on each other.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Need each other but you also have to meet each other's needs.
L:  That's correct.  I -- I definitely agree.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, right.
L:  Um, a- a- and I think one of the interesting things that I've found is, you know, I'm -- I'm over thirty now and I feel that my relationships and things that I get involved in [SIGH] tend to be a little bit more hurried on the front end.
R:  Hm.
L:  Um, and so it's like trying to find out, yeah, are we compatible?  Do we have --
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know.  Y- you tend to hurry that whole like getting to know ya type thing now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, whereas before, i- it was always, you know, the fun part of dating.
R:  Right, right.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Now, it's like the dreaded part.  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly, it's like ...
R:  But it's true.  I mean, if -- if the person -- if you and the person are not gonna be compatible, you're not, I mean, it's not really worth the [LAUGH] time invested especially as we get older and we're thinking about making -- you know, settling down with a family and --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- limited time left on earth and [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- things like that.
L:  Yeah, you definitely tend to -- to want to find out, "Is this right or is it not right?"
R:  Mhm.
L:  And sometimes it's almost to a fault.  Sometimes I seem -- find myself, you know, maybe passing up on an opportunity that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [MN] could have worked --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- if I'd have given it some time but for some reason it just wasn't there at that point in time.
R:  We start getting impatient as we get older.  [LAUGH]
L:  I think so.  [LAUGH]
R:  But at the same time, I mean, you -- if it's not, uh -- if there's not a lot of potential there for compatibility, it's really [MN] -- it may not be worth your time and I don't know.  It's sort of a trade off.  [LAUGH]
L:  Sure, definitely.
R:  But the other part of that is, what happens when you had a friend that you've had since, you know, childhood or high school or something, that, you know, you're no longer all that compatible.  Like you're still friends and you feel comfortable with each other but your lives have taken different turns and you don't have a lot in common any more and you live in different states and you're trying really hard to keep that up because it's important to you and you leave a history but you don't have a lot of, y- you know -- have a lot to talk about anymore.  It's a little awkward.
L:  Right.
R:  That's -- I've been finding that lately.  It's --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it's tough because, you know, I don't wanna just give up on people and -- and, you know, they [inaudible] you built with someone and you're feeling a connection with them but --
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- it -- that only goes so far.  You have to -- you have to still be compatible as you were when you were ten or eighteen or whatever.
L:  And it's a -- that's an interesting point because, I mean, friendships are just as equally a -- a relationship as -- as, you know, someone that you're dating.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So, you have to work at, you know, relationship as a friend as well.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um ...
R:  That's a thing I think we all learn when --
L:  Exactly.
R:  Maybe when we get out of college or during college.  I think that's probably the time period.
L:  Sure, sure.
R:  It's a -- you sort of -- you -- you start -- I don't know about everyone but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- when you have like your real first heavy duty romantic relationship and you realise that, [MN] you know, it's -- it's a -- it's a job, you know.  [LAUGH] You have to work at it to make it still be, um, [LIPSMACK] healthy.  I mean, you don't have to hopefully work too hard but it's something you have to maintain.
L:  Right.
R:  But, y- you know, I -- I realized at least that I, you know -- I had been taking my regular old friendships a little bit for granted and didn't realize that they were relationships that I really had to maintain as well and to have the same kind of, you know, conscientiousness and working out problems and things like that.
L:  Yeah.  [MN] That's definitely interesting.  I mean, um, personally I've -- I'm new to the area in which I live and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- uh [MN] the people that I tend to date and go out with, you know, they've had friends forever.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, they've had friends that they've gone to school with and friends that they've, you know, partied with in College and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know they have all those established relationships and yet here I am trying to mooch off of those friendships --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because personally I don't have that history with the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- people here, you know.
R:  That's hard.
L:  It is.  It's very hard and -- and you find yourself working much harder at maintaining friendships and you find --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- them more valuable.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You tend to also pick and choose who you want to be in your life I think.
R:  Yep.
L:  As you get older as well.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, you don't have the time for the drama.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  Like you used to.
R:  That's a good catch phrase.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, definitely.
R:  Should be like on a pen.
L:  [LAUGH] I don't have time for the drama.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But ...
R:  But the other thing about having, um [LIPSMACK] -- being new to an area and, you know, the people you meet have long standing friends is that that's just -- just another whole set of people that you're automatically being introduced to.
L:  Correct.
R:  And widening your circle of friends automatically.
L:  Definitely.
R:  So it's sort of a bonus but I can imagine it would be harder.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it -- it definitely is.  I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it -- I would compare it to, you know, being a step parent and --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- walking into an already made, you know, family.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, because you have to give those sorts of, um [MN] considerations to, you know, people that you choose to be involved with --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because they have these friendships and you have to be willing to --
R:  Right.
L:  -- l- let the person go and -- and still have their fun with their friends because, you know, that's what they've always done.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, so ...
R:  And if you can't accept that, they're not gonna accept you as a partner.  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.
R:  [NOISE] Wow.  [NOISE]
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah, you're totally right about this -- this stepchild thing.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It -- I actually had that experience [NOISE] in high school because I switched, um, from the town I grew up in, I went to a different town for high school and this is a small town and very close a- and everyone else -- everyone had known everyone else since, you know, age two and everyone had grown up with each other and so it was really v- -- really hard for me to break in and, sort of, make good friends and -- and like everyone because I had to.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  But at the same time it was really fun because -- at least my freshman year it was because everyone was really sick of each other from knowing each other, and only each other, for so long.
L:  Sure.
R:  So, it was good and bad.  But in the end I -- um, I don't know, it's probably due to a few other reasons too but in the end I -- I, you know -- the end of senior year I'd kinda thought back and it's like, "You know these people aren't really my friends" [LAUGH] 'cause --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I met them most -- I had a long term relationship in -- in -- through most of high school and the people I became friends with and hung out with were my boyfriend's friends from, you know, age two.  And, um, you know, when he and I [LAUGH] split up, I realized these people weren't really my friends to begin with but I didn't know any -- anyone else or didn't know anything else.  And that was tough.
L:  Sure.  That's always humbling, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to --
R:  It really was.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- to have to go back and realize that, you know, maybe these people are just along for the ride because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, of their prior, you know, relationship with your boyfriend so ...
R:  Yeah.  It was weird but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But at the same time it would -- it had me do a lot of soul searching and I took a very different approach when I went to college and friend making.  [LAUGH]
L:  Sure.
R:  So, [inaudible] was good.  But it was true.  I was really -- I wasn't compatible with probably ninety percent of people I was high school friends with and that it turns out the people I've kept in touch with from high school had nothing to do with my boyfriend from my [LAUGH] school.  They were totally other people I had made friends with on the side and were sort of outsider people that didn't belong to the big group.  So where ...
L:  And -- and you need those individual friends.
R:  You do.
