L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  I'm Sarah.
R:  I'm Mary, nice to meet you.
L:  Nice to meet you too.
R:  Um, do you have pets?
L:  I do.  I have five.
R:  Oh, my God!
L:  I know.  That's what everyone says.  We have two dogs and three cats.
R:  Oh, my!  That -- that should be a busy handful.
L:  It is.  It's a mad house.  Do you have any?
R:  I've got a dog.
L:  What kind of dog is it?
R:  A chocolate Lab.
L:  [MN] They're big dogs.
R:  Yeah.  He's two years old and he's -- when he stands up he's as tall as me.  I'm like one sixty five.
L:  Oh, my God!  That's huge.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you, um, live in a house or an apartment?
R:  House.
L:  Oh, so it has room, huh?
R:  Well, okay, not really because we just moved here --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and there's construction everywhere --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so we can't take it out.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  Yeah, it's pretty sad.
L:  We live in an apartment building --
R:  Ow, ouch!
L:  -- and everyone has animals.  [LIPSMACK]  So, it's cool.
R:  But how do you ...?
L:  Sorry?
R:  But how do you -- how do you put up with all that noise?
L:  It's not bad.  It's really quiet.
R:  It is?
L:  [COUGH] My dog when we're home he, uh -- well, he growls.  He's like -- it's a Miniature Schnauzer and he's always on patrol.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  Yeah.  So, he's always growling, like any noise he -- and when we sit out on the back porch he always sits at the railings and just watches.
R:  What a cool dog you have.
L:  Yeah, he's cool.  He's cool.  And the other one's a Shih-tzu and he's pretty dumb.
R:  Oh, my!  [LAUGH]
L:  Not a big fan.  [LAUGH]  He's okay, but he's dumb.  [COUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I don't work right now so I do hang out with my animals quite a bit.
R:  Oh, that's cool.
L:  Yeah.  I let the cats sleep on my bed when I'm home.  Not at night though 'cause they climb on my head.
R:  Are you serious?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well, my one cat sometimes I let -- I leave my bedroom door open [LIPSMACK] and the one cat comes and sleeps on my pillow right above my head, but he really likes hair.
R:  Oh, my!
L:  So, he likes plays with my hair all the time and kinda bites it.  He grooms -- he's weird.  He like likes a lot.  But, yeah, I hang out with my animals all the time.
R:  Wow!  See, I don't have that luxury.  I don't get to hang out with my puppy as much, but I'll play with him.  Like every night I'll go pat him --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- whenever I can.  It's my brother's dog, like my parents literally bought it for him.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I love him [several inaudible words].  He's always at a level ground with me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  With my sister and my brother he tends to not listen to them when -- when they tell him stuff.  But if I say it he knows he has to listen.
L:  Mm.  It's your dog.
R:  Well, not really.  I'm the one with the slipper [inaudible] and things.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Did you get him at a, um -- where -- where did you get him?
R:  It was a breeder --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in a little place and I tried -- tried so hard to get him.  He's a pure bred and you should see him.  He's got green eyes and he's a chocolate Lab --
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  -- and he's huge.  It's not -- it's not an English.  So, it's nice and like thin, but not really that thin.  So, it's rounded.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  He's beautiful, but he's huge.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Every time people see it -- and he's still a puppy, like he's only two.  He doesn't know any better.  Do you know what I mean?  He loves people and he loves people.  So, he's really, really smart.  Like my parents have to go to work at night.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, he's really quiet during the mornings when they sleep --
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  -- and he'll go to sleep beside my Mom.  Like my Mom used to be the type of person who doesn't go anywhere near pets because she's a neat freak.
L:  Oh, no.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  And now she lets him sleep on her bed.
L:  [MN]
R:  Yeah.  It's so cute.  You should see when my Dad comes in he'll be the first one at the door waiting for him.
L:  Dogs are great.
R:  I know.  I -- I love him.  Like, uh, I don't know -- I don't know what I would've done without him I guess.
L:  Mhm.
R:  He's a good dog.  He's -- he's a joy no matter which way you look at it.  You always know there's someone there waiting for you when you get home.
L:  Yep, and they're always excited to see you.  [COUGH]
R:  I know.
L:  Those are the kinda dogs -- Labs are kinda dogs that you can take everywhere with you and they'll be so well behaved.
R:  Okay.  My Lab's not that kinda dog.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, he probably will be though 'cause they're -- they're really -- they're smart, you know?
R:  Oh, I'll give you that.
L:  Mhm.  And they'll learn, you know, when they get older they know where they're comfortable and -- and --
R:  Oh ...
L:  -- like my dog you cannot let him off a leash, he'll be gone.
R:  See, that's -- that's the problem with my puppy.  He's so spoilt.
L:  Mhm.
R:  If you let him off the leash he's not coming back.  I think ...
L:  He might get over that.
R:  Oh, he will -- let's say in a couple of years he's gonna be really old and grumpy and just sleeping around the house.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I love him.  He's so beautiful.  He's so spoilt.  He'll come and sit at the dinner table and he'll give you his paws so we can give him food.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  I'm not kidding.  He's --
L:  That's a bad habit.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- he's so ...
L:  But you can't help it.
R:  Huh?
L:  You can't help it though 'cause they look at you and you just have to give 'em food.
R:  See, you're just like my sister.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Like my Mom and my Dad feels sorry for him 'cause my Dad's the type of person who would discipline me and I -- I remember he'd make me stand by the wall like counting up to a thousand on one foot.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Our puppy he can't -- he can't -- he has to give him something to eat and he -- he became so proud.  I used to make my brother walk him all the time.
L:  [MN]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you live in a city?  What kind of neighborhood is it?
R:  It's a little town right now.  We moved to a little town.  We used to live in the city.  Now it's -- it's a little town, but it's under construction where we live.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, there isn't a lot of green stuff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  He doesn't get a play a lot.  It makes me really sad because I wish I could spend more time with him and play with him.
L:  You could run him around the house.
R:  Well, that's what we do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like gone.  My brother plays with him like crazy.  You should see him and he gets so excited to play.  He loves walking outside.  My Mom figured out a way to keep him outside on a leash so that he actually doesn't run away.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It actually works.
L:  Hm.
R:  Like he sits there watching everybody go by.
L:  You know what's nice is when you set up those runs?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And say you set it up from like your back porch to a tree and then you hook 'em up to it and they can go up and down it.
R:  I never thought of that.
L:  They have 'em at like Wool Mart and stuff.
R:  I agree.
L:  Sorry?
R:  Oh, I agree.  I've -- I've probably seen it, but I've never thought of it.
L:  Yeah, it's really cool.  I used to have one when I had a yard [COUGH] and I would just let my dog out and he would just go up and down the run.  I got the longest one that I could find.  So, he kinda feels like he's on his own, you know, but he's still tied up.
R:  Oh, good.
L:  Mhm.  But I don't have a yard really right now.  So ...
R:  Well, we don't either because it's all under construction.  So, all we got is dirt everywhere you look.  Lots of people like miss seeing grass and when he sees grass he actually tries to eat it now.
L:  [MN]
R:  It's really sad.  You should see him.  He's beautiful.
L:  Is it like a [COUGH] -- are they building new houses around you?
R:  Yeah, that's exactly what they're doing.  It's a new complex and like we just moved in.  So, there's absolutely no grass nowhere.
L:  [MN]
R:  [several inaudible words] all the time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, it's like oh, he's home all the night.  So, she'd take him out.
L:  Do you have any parks near you?
R:  No, we don't.  That's the problem.  Like now they're building most of it right now.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, I spend time with him whenever I can.
L:  Does he like car rides?
R:  Oh, he loves them.
L:  Does he hang out the window?
R:  Yes, he does.
L:  Mhm.  Big dogs always really love that.  [COUGH]
R:  But you should see him.  He's so happy when he does it and it's ...
L:  It's funny 'cause the wind like pushes their face back.
R:  That's so true.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.  Well, have you ever driven down a highway or like down a road and the bugs hit your arm, like if you put your arm out?
R:  That's true.
L:  And they hurt.  I can't imagine.  But dogs -- all my dogs have always loved the car ride, hanging their faces out.  My dog just crawls up in the seat.
R:  Are you serious?
L:  Yeah.  He doesn't care.  He usually just goes to sleep.
R:  Okay.  When we're in the car my puppy does absolutely nothing but watch everything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  If you have the windows down he actually puts his head and wants to leap out of the window.
L:  [COUGH] Oh, no.
R:  Yeah.  So, we have to keep it like really closed.
L:  My -- my parents had a dog once and they had an old truck, like a pick up truck, and they used to let the dog ride in the back and my Dad was watching [COUGH] in the mirror the dog in the back, you know, 'cause he could tell that he was ready to jump out.  So, they slowed way down, like they were almost not moving and the dog jumped out and then they got him and that was it.  He did never did that again.
R:  Oh, my God!  No, if you -- our puppy's pretty crazy.  If he wants to jump out he wants to jump out.
L:  Mhm.
R:  He likes to be free.  He's -- he's -- I'm telling you he's so spoilt it's unbelievable.  I'm the only one that gets to give him discipline.  So, I'm the only one he knows --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, to tip toe around.  So, he if he wants something from me he'll actually sit at my like foot and tell me.  He'll just sit there and cry his eyes out until I actually do it.
L:  Yeah.  Dogs are smart.
R:  They are.  This one's really smart.  Once -- okay, you know what?  He's so smart that when we first moved here my parents used to work at night still.  My Mom's home now.
L:  Where did they work?
R:  Uh, they work at a huge company now.  I think it's [inaudible] Company.  I could be wrong.
L:  Where do you live?
R:  We live in Milton.
L:  In where?
R:  Milton.
