L:  Kirsten.
R:  Hi, I'm Linda.
L:  I'm Kirsten.  
R:  Kirsten?
L:  Yes.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I do have a favorite sport.  I --
R:  You do?
L:  Yes.  I am an avid hockey fan.  Avid.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yes.
R:  Very good.  I'm so glad 'cause now we'll have something to talk about.  [LAUGH].
L:  I am a very, very big fan of the New York Rangers and --
R:  Are you?
L:  -- uh -- and when it's hockey season, uh, it is not strange for me to spend two or three days a week watching -- um hockey is on three nights a week.  The hockey teams play three days a week and uh --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- not so much recently.  I'm a grad student now and I have a lot more work to do, but when I was working and I didn't have to work in the evening, um, I -- I would -- I had the -- and when I lived in New York, I had the uh M.S.G. channels so I could watch them every time they were on.  M.S.G. carries the Rangers games.
R:  Cool.
L:  So, yes, I am a big, big hockey fan.  Watch lots of playoffs, when they come.  Watch all the teams.  So do you watch any sports at all?
R:  Hardly ever, unless I'm forced to.  I -- I [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I um -- not on T.V. but my -- my friend is an umpire and I go to see softball games and fast pitch and stuff like that, you know, and Little League.
L:  I like -- 
R:  And --
L:  I like the --
R:  And I like soccer.  What?
L:  I do like baseball, but I don't watch it on television.
R:  Uh-huh.  I -- I like soccer um.  My children's father uh is Greek and a long time ago, you know Pele?  I think that's his name.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Well, that's when he was all, you know, hot and everything and -- and then li- I -- I finally got kinda interested in that 'cause he would always watch soccer, and I -- I never could imagine how anybody could play a ball so long without touching it, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  But uh other than that, I don't -- I'm trying to think.  The figure skating, that's a sport?
L:  I guess, yeah.  That's a sport.  The Olympics, I guess, are a sport.
R:  I love figure skating.  I really do.
L:  I'm not that -- you know, it would be better if they had sticks and were beating people.
R:  Sticks and what?
L:  They're beating people.  As long as they're wearing the skates they might as well, you know, put a net out there.
R:  Yeah, true too.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  And that -- go toothless and everything, like.  [LAUGH].  
L:  Oh.  But uh yeah, yeah.  Big hockey fan.  Should of -- what other sports I watch on television?  I'm trying to think.  Uh, not many.  Uh, I watch the -- I live in Tampa so I watch the Super Bowl.
R:  Oh.  I'm in Allentown, Pennsylvania.  
L:  Ah.  I know where that is.  I had to look it up on the map just yesterday.
R:  Really?
L:  Uh -- uh, this guy my husband works with is going to a training seminar and he's flying into Allentown.  
R:  Oh. 
L:  So we were, like, where the heck is it?  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  Well, Billy Joel put us uh -- I don't know if he put us on the map or off the map.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  There you go.  
R:  Okay.  So I guess we have to stick to the subject, right?
L:  I think so.  Um --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- I'm thinking.  Television sports.  I'm trying to -- football, watch the Super Bowl, um, that was the only football game I watched.  Um, don't usually watch baseball on television.  Um, what else?  [MN].  Sports.  I know there's gotta be another one.  Uh --
R:  Well, I try to do this much, what I try to do so that I can be a more rounded person, I'm fifty six years old and I'm more into theatre and the arts, music, than -- than I am sports and then I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I often wondered, how can people be so interested in sports and so I have friends who like sports and when they watch, I will watch just so I can, like, hone my appreciation for -- for sports.  
L:  I hear you.  My --
R:  And I realize that -- go ahead?
L:  My husband is the same way.  I am like this diehard [inaudible] whether they win, whether they lose, whether they suck or they're good players or they're bad players, if they're on television, I wanna watch 'em even if it's just abysmal and when they're in town, we go see them and my husband is like, "I don't get it.  I don't get it".
R:  [LAUGH].  Yeah, that's -- that's -- that's -- really I think that's what I can say.  I re- I just don't get it either.  Like, what -- so let's hit this little thing around and then act stupid and punch each other and, you know --
L:  Any -- any --
R:  -- what -- what?  What?
L:  He's like, "How -- how do you choose a team?  Why do you like this team better than any other team?"
R:  Yeah, yeah.  
L:  He's like --
R:  Well, I know, I have friends who came from Pittsburgh and they were great Steelers fans.  I could understand that, you know?
L:  Because he can understand that, but like me, I never lived -- I mean, I lived in upstate New York but never lived in New York City.  I mean --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- if I were gonna choose a hockey team that's somewhere I lived, I would of chosen the Sabers.  I mean, I grew up south of Buffalo and I uh -- I lived in Buffalo for a few years, so I mean, he's like "Why not the Sabers?"  I'm like, because -- but I mean, I know why I like the Rangers, but different people like different teams for different reasons.  Um, sometimes they like a team because someone they know hates 'em and so they got the little rivalry thing going.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Sometimes they like a team because -- like, in my case, I'm -- one of the players on the team I -- I really like and I -- I started watching the team because I liked the way the player played and I became a fan of the team.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Now that we live in Tampa, um, I go to the Lightning game and we go to probably somewhere between five and ten a year.  
R:  Wow.
L:  And uh -- that's not that many.
R:  And your husband goes with you?
L:  Oh, he loves it.  He loves to go see the game, and he's actually become quite a hockey fan.  We -- he loves to watch the playoffs, he can appreciate a good team and a bad team.  Um, I think the cool thing for him was watching the Lightning, when they were really bad, to now they're kinda okay and he's seen the progression so he can -- he can see the technical parts of the game or -- of -- of like puck handling skills and -- and bad passing and a little bit of the plate and we -- I like to sit high up 'cause I like to see the play develop on ice, and that's how I watch the game.  So he -- he gets the game commentary from me based on the way I watch the game, so he -- he has appreciation for a lot of things about the game that I like because --
R:  I see.
L:  -- because that's what I talk about, but um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- yeah, he's -- he's become a fan, um, but he just enjoys the game.  He's not loyal to any particular team.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  He's just uh -- he's just a fan of the game and whenever he goes to the game, he doesn't -- he roots for the Lightning when the Rangers are in town, just to make me mad.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  But uh other -- other than that, he just um -- is just a fan of the game itself.  He likes to be there, he likes the crowd, he likes to watch -- he really likes to watch the game.  He's real- he's really gotten good at it.  
R:  Wow.
L:  So -- yeah.
R:  I'm proud of you.
L:  It's kinda cool.
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  But in the beginning, he just came along because I liked it and uh --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But it is fun.  I mean, I don't know if you've ever -- I mean, watching hockey on television is -- is one thing, and that's one thing I can say about watching hockey on television.  It's very different to being at the game.  Number one, you have an announcer.  Number two, the puck is moving very fast.  The cameraman knows where the puck is 'cause he -- he's watched enough hockey to know where the puck is gonna be, so the camera follows the puck.  When you're in the arena, the whistle blows, you don't know why, there's no announcer and um sometimes you don't know where the puck is and sometimes --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- there's a lot of activity, but it's not near the puck.  Sometimes they'll be having a fight or whatever, but uh it's not where the puck is.  The play -- uh, it's behind the play so it's uh -- it's very different.  It's -- you have to really pay attention, you have to really know what you're doing, to be able to watch.
R:  Okay.  I -- I -- I see what you're saying.  I have to admit, when I go to these softball games, I never know [LAUGH] who's winning.
L:  Yeah, because you -- you don't --
R:  I don't even know when the game's over --
L:  -- have someone to --
R:  -- until everybody gets up.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.
R:  But I try.  I really try [LAUGH].
L:  But uh, with hockey, you really have to pay attention because the puck moves so fast and you have to -- and the thing is, you can easily go to a hockey game and -- and really be lost because you have to kinda anticipate where you think the puck is gonna be, and the players move so fast, it's possible that if you anticipate the wrong place, you'll miss the whole play.  Um, especially if the play's in front of the net. 
R:  Oh.  So then isn't it better to sit higher up so you get more of a perspect-
L:  It depends which -- it depends what you want from the game.  Um, I like to sit higher up because I like the perspective, I like to really -- I sit right behind the goal, I can see the goal tending, I really love the goal tending.  Um some people like to sit close and feel the grit of the game, you know?  They wanna see the guy slam up in front of -- on the boards right in front of them.  Um, those are -- those are -- you -- but the problem is, you sit low and -- and just as you -- they're -- 'cause the -- the rink is round, it's an oval.  There -- you actually -- if you -- there are places where, when you sit low, you won't be able to see the corners of the rink. 
R:  Mm.  
L:  So uh --
R:  I wouldn't like that.  [LAUGH].
L:  I don't like that either.  And it's harder -- it is harder to follow the game because you can't actually always see the puck.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So um --
R:  Well, my both children are in theatre and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I -- when I go to their plays --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I go three or four times and I sit in different places for different reasons too.  [LAUGH].
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  To see the play differently.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Yeah, and you see it differently and you see how the -- the scene comes together differently so, yeah.  Yeah.  I -- and everyone -- you know, everybody who is a sports fan has their place they like to sit for their particular sport.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  But uh -- but on television, they seat you in one place and they show you -- they sort -- they edit the game for you.  That's -- that's different.
R:  And -- and --
