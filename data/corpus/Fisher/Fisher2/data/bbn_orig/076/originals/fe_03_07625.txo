L:  Yeah, it really is.
R:  And, uh --
L:  Were you able to give to somebody that you knew?

L:  Well, that's good, yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  Um, one of ours got out under the fence shortly after we moved here 'cause --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- he just wasn't used to, you know, to being fenced in.  And, uh, was lost for a couple of days.
R:  Mm.
L:  And, uh, we -- we were just sick about it, just worrying if he was okay, but, um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- uh, we f- -- put out flyers in the neighborhood and -- and one of our neighbors, her sister had been over there and -- and, uh, had taken him home with her, so he was just fine as it turns out. [LAUGH]
R:  That's good.
L:  He wasn't sure he wanted to come home.
R:  [LAUGH] He had a good time over there, uh?  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, he did, he got a lot of attention.
R:  Mhm.  So, what kind of pets do you -- you have dogs?
L:  Yeah, one is a yorkie and the other one is, uh, half yorkie, half, uh, shih-tzu.
R:  Okay.
L:  So he doesn't look anything like a yorkie.
R:  Ah.
L:  And, um ... uh, we went to get him, planning to get a yorkie, and -- and we came home with him instead.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So -- but they're a lotta company, and we have a little girl so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- she just loves spending time with 'em and playing with 'em and -- she doesn't have any brothers or sisters yet so [LAUGH] ...

R:  Yes, that dog's coming back too.
L:  Oh, that's the dog's -- coming back, okay.
R:  That dog's definitely coming back.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  And I've got to get [several inaudible words] --

R:  No, no.
L:  No, so it's just --
R:  Ah --
L:  -- it's just you and the pups, huh?
R:  Me and the pups.
L:  Well -- and so -- well, no wonder you're able to give 'em their own room. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yes, they get their own room.
L:  We have to share with ours.  We don't have room for 'em to have their very own room.
R:  Oh.
L:  They pretty much r- -- own the house anyway.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's ...
L:  So, where are you getting your new puppy?
R:  Um, at the -- from a pet -- th- they have, um, pet adoption --

L:  Oh, really?
R:  And it's, uh -- so my, um [LIPSMACK] ... uh, it's just a market, it's a flea market like they have every, um, Saturday, Sunday in Hollywood.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, uh -- farmers' market.
L:  Yeah, farmers' market, sure.
R:  They -- they have that all the time in Hollywood and block off the streets.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And they have these pets down here.
L:  They have dogs down there?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, that's amazing.
R:  Dogs, cats ... and, um, they need homes [inaudible] you know.
L:  Right.  Do they give 'em shots or anything for you?
R:  Yes, everything -- everything comes, shots and everything.
L:  So it's like the ASPCA?
R:  Ye-, ah, yes.
L:  Oh, well, that's great.
R:  Yes.
L:  I've never seen anything like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We've got a pretty big farmers' market here and we [NOISE] go every now and then but we've never seen anything like that.
R:  Okay, but see, it's not the farmers' mar- -- uh, what that -- what it is, farmers' market, they gi- -- they give a, um, they block streets off.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You understand what I'm saying?
L:  [NOISE] Oh, so it's like a street fair almost.
R:  A street fair, right.  They have farmers' market --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- here but they --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- also put in a street fair too.
L:  Oh, well, that's great.
R:  Every Saturday, Sunday in Hollywood, do it out in Hollywood and put a street fair.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They have all kind of things out there, you know.
L:  So they shut off the road so you can just walk around?
R:  Shut off -- exactly.  Exactly.
L:  Oh, that's awesome.  What fun.
R:  Exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's great --
R:  And --
L:  -- for those businesses too, I bet.
R:  Oh, yeah, it -- you know, and they've been doing their little, uh, sales --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, tomatoes and the plants and all that.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Fruits.
L:  Yeah, a friend of mine does that.  He, um, he raises plants and goes to a flea market every weekend and, um, you know, sells those and -- and he's doing great.
R:  Well, that's great. [NOISE] It --
L:  So -- I mean, 'cause there's no overhead with that.  He's, uh, he's a, um, [LIPSMACK] oh, what do you call it, a nurseryman, so he knows about all those plants and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  He's up in Seattle ...
R:  Oh.
L:  ... doing that, so -- but yeah, he loves it.  But he hadn't told me anything about shutting down streets or -- I think it's just a c- -- I think it's just a regular old farmers' market.  But --
R:  Oh, okay.  Where's this at?  Where he's at?
L:  He's in Seattle -- we- well, not in Seattle but he's near Seattle, Washington.
R:  Oh, okay, okay.
L:  And, um, then where we are, the -- the farmers' market is in an old, um [LIPSMACK] uh, like, drive in theater.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So -- and it's a big, busy street going by so it's not anything they could close down.  What you've got sounds a lot nicer.
R:  Oh yeah, it's real nice the way they did it, so ...
L:  Are you from California, or ...?
R:  Yes, I'm from -- raised in -- in California.
L:  So you're real rare then. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  There must be, like, what, three of ya all out there?
R:  Huh?
L:  There must be, like, three native Californians in the world?
R:  Uh ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You're right, there's not too many of 'em.  Ah --
L:  Not too many.  Isn't everybody from someplace else?
R:  Someplace else, yes. [LAUGH]
L:  Just like Florida, it's just like here. [NOISE]
R:  Very rare.
L:  There's hardly anybody who was born here. [NOISE]
R:  No, it's -- it's very rare finding somebody born --
L:  Uh-huh, yeah.  So, you like it?
R:  Oh, I love it.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, do y- --
R:  Well, um, actually I [inaudible] move -- we w- -- hopefully move, I'm going to, um, Hawaii --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- in July and see about there and, um ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And see, I might like it out there and I might move out there to Hawaii.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm just going out there for vacation right now though.
L:  Well, it's -- I hear it's --
R:  So --
L:  -- expensive to live there but gosh, it's so beautiful.
R:  Yeah?  I never been so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Are you near a beach where you are?  You're -- you're pretty close, aren't ya?
R:  Oh, yes, uh -- well, n- -- it's actually about two hours for me.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Yes.
L:  Is there a place -- do you all have a place there where you can take your dogs? [NOISE]
R:  Oh, yes, they have a -- matter of fact they have -- at the [inaudible] beach they have a -- a dog park.
L:  A dog park? [NOISE]
R:  Yes, they just put it there, just built there for only -- dogs only.
L:  Well, that's great.
R:  You know.
L:  They've -- they've got something like -- there's an island here.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, oh, I can't remember the name of it now.  I think it's -- it's either Caladisi[?] or Honeymoon Island.
R:  Right.
L:  But they've got a dog beach there and you can just take --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- the dog and let him run crazy and --
R:  And now that's so nice. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, and they can't get lost --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and they can't get off the island so [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, they're -- they're safe there and ...
R:  What did, um --
L:  So it's a lot of fun.
R:  They need it like that for little dogs and pets, you know.
L:  Well, especially in the city.  'Cause --
R:  Y- -- oh, yes.
L:  -- you can't let 'em really run around, I mean --
R:  Yeah, [inaudible] yeah, that's true.
L:  Yeah, our -- we don't have a -- you know, we have kind of a small backyard so they can't really r- -- I mean, they can run around --
R:  Get around.
L:  -- but they can't really run around.
R:  Right.
L:  So -- and then out on the street you gotta have 'em on a leash or they'll get killed. [LAUGH] So ...
R:  Mm, [LIPSMACK] yeah.  Yeah, so ...
L:  [NOISE] You can probably hear him now. [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  My little girl just aggravating him and they're --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- playing with a -- fighting over a stuffed toy.
R:  Running round wild, uh. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Are you missing your puppy?
R:  Oh, yeah, I do.  I go see her about -- at least three times a day -- I mean --
L:  Do you really?
R:  -- not a day, three times a week, I apologize on that one.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Three times a week.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  Well, it sounds like it's great that you're getting out of that place where you can't have her in.
R:  Oh, definitely, definitely.
L:  Yeah, that would -- that would just be too hard.
R:  You know, it's ... well, I'm going to get another one too, so ...
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- she'll have company then --
R:  Yes, and --
L:  -- when you're at work at stuff, she can ... she can, uh, play with him.
R:  Oh yeah, they could play [inaudible]. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's why we ended up with two, because one of 'em was so lonely. [NOISE] When we were -- 'cause we were both working at the time and --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So we got the second one to keep the first one company and ... [LIPSMACK] now they're -- now they're a lot happier.
R:  N- -- yeah.
L:  I don't think dogs are supposed to be alone very much.
R:  No, they don't.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't believe that anyway, you're right.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  They should always have somebody around 'em.
L:  Yeah, that's just not natural.
R:  No.  They just -- [MN] they're like human beings but they're in a different form. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I always wanted to go over to, like, [NOISE] Great Britain where supposedly everybody takes their dogs everywhere with 'em, you know.
R:  Ooh, okay.
L:  It's not like here where you can't take 'em in anyplace.  You can take 'em in pubs and, you know --
R:  Is that right?
L:  -- restaurants and -- yeah.
R:  Ah.
L:  They -- they just take 'em everywhere.
R:  Hm.
L:  So -- but everybody's so nutty over here about ... oh, I don't know, fleas or whatever, and I guess somebody probably would not be taking care of their dogs.
R:  Well, yeah, that's understandable --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but you have a lot of us that do, you know, [several inaudible words] worry about none of that.
L:  Well, exactly.  It seems like if nothing else --
R:  No.
L:  -- you could have your, you know, your certificate from your vet showing --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- they'd had their shots and --
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  -- you know.
R:  Show 'em everything.
L:  Yeah, so --
R:  No.
L:  -- but we [several inaudible words] --
