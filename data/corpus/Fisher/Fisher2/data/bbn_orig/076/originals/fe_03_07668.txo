R:  Hi, my name is Don and I am from Minnesota.
L:  Hi, I'm Madeline and I live in Iowa.
R:  Oh, okay.  Hi.  Um, well, I guess I kind of have pets not because I chose to, but I have, um, a lizard at home because my daughter --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- brought it home and, um, I ...
L:  You're a good Mom.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, she moved on and left the lizard and, um --
L:  Well, that's ...
R:  -- another one -- my other daughter took a cat home.  She's gonna watch it while they went up north and then to Kansas City and then they're gonna come back and get it and they never got it.  So ...
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, my gosh, you've become a pet owner by default.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  That's great though.  That's nice of you to do.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Uh, we had, uh -- we live on a farm so we, uh -- are pets are -- are not exactly so much pets -- right now is, uh, working farm cats.  We did have, um -- when the kids were growing up we had dogs and, uh, they loved them and we did too but, uh, after the last dog it was, uh, sort of one of those things were, you know, um, you -- you look at each other and say well, I'm not quite ready to have the next one.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So, we're -- we're sort of in that stage and unfortunately we, uh -- since we do live out in the country quite often, um, someone will -- you know, they -- they seem to think that if you leave a dog or a cat, uh, you know, out in the country that they will find a good farm home and some of them make it, some don't.  So, some of our oddest pets [LAUGH] have been drop ins.
R:  Mm.
L:  A little -- a little like your family.  They didn't -- they, um -- they weren't left with us I guess, but they -- they sort of found us and some of them, uh, you know, you -- you -- I just can't see 'em -- you can't see 'em starve or -- or be hurt.  So, um, they've been an interesting and bizarre collection [LAUGH] of critters --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- over the years, those and the hamsters we used to have when the kids were small.
R:  Oh, the hamsters.  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Did your daughter have those too?
R:  Yes.  Yep.  We've had hamsters.  We had a guinea pig.  We've had, um -- oh, God!  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  One of ours escaped and, um, spent -- we -- we had visions of their breeding with mice and [LAUGH] creating super mousters or --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- hamsouses, whatever the -- the cross would be and, uh, one -- it finally, uh, much -- much thinner and much ready to be caught it materialized by the fireplace.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.
L:  It really -- it was almost like knocking on the cage door begging to be brought back in.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  Yeah.  I guess -- somebody bought my daughter a brown and white mouse.  It was, um, the kind that you feed to snakes.
L:  Oh.
R:  Anyway the mouse got -- chewed through -- they put him in a cardboard box -- he chewed through.  We never saw him.  That was about eight months ago and then here somebody saw him and they're like yeah, you have a brown mouse running around.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, that's the mouse that she brought home.
L:  Here kitty, kitty is not an appropriate response.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  That would solve that problem.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, we have a cat.  So, I don't know.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Is it one of th- -- a longhaired cat or a ...?
R:  Oh, it's just a plain old, um -- I don't know -- like a cal- -- it looks like a tiger cat, but it has some -- a little bit of orange, but it's mostly gray and white, kind of a little ...
L:  Mm.  Is it a friendly cat or a cat with attitude?
R:  No, it's friendly.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It looks like it's had some kittens, um, and it's name is Claudia.
L:  Oh, okay, that's classy.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I haven't had the nerve to, um -- I don't know -- I haven't had the heart to bring her to the Humane Society to be adopted 'cause she's pretty good, you know?
L:  Mhm.  You think she probably will find a good home eventually there --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- or do you think she'll be with you?
R:  I hope she finds a good home.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, 'cause my daughter came -- we had another cat that my -- oh, God! -- my seventeen year old picked up, it was a free kitten, but it looks like a Russian Blue --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- or a Russian -- I don't know what it is.  But, okay, so --
L:  Sounds pretty.
R:  -- the other -- oldest daughter came and got it, brought it to Center City and I guess, um, it was there with her a week and then it ran off and it never came back.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.  So ...
L:  Sometimes they're hard to transplant, you know?
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH] We -- we had one that we were very much -- very anxious to transplant and, um, gave it to one of the neighbors.  It was in a covered container so we took it.  Uh, they kept it in their, uh -- like they had a laundry room, sort of a mud room sort of thing, and they kept it for a week, spoiled it rotten [LAUGH] and the moment we opened the door the dumb thing made a beeline -- I'm not quite how you do that, but the cat [several inaudible words] --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and there it was again just as ordinary as ever.  I was like oh, darn!  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  They had children who wanted the cat and we -- we wanted the cat to go find a new home.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  There it was, um, 'cause she called, uh, within, uh, twelve hours of when they let it out for the first time and she said, "Is it back?" and I looked out.  [LAUGH]  Yeah, there it was.
R:  [MN]
L:  Uh, I -- I don't know how -- I mean, if you kept -- put me in a covered container and transported me several miles I don't know like -- I mean, theoretically the -- the -- for the equivalent distance that'd be like taking me to another country [LAUGH] and I'd a little trouble getting home.  But this dumb thing didn't.  It --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- it was kinda -- it was one of those, uh -- that -- at that point, um -- another tomcat was having a territorial war and I got -- you know, I -- I got tired of hearing them growl at each other [LAUGH] and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- stake out territory.
R:  Oh, jeeze!  Yeah.
L:  At one point, uh, they -- they spent a long time, um -- they -- they I think got tired.  In the course of an afternoon [LAUGH] they were reduced to just lying there staring at each other and growling occasionally.  Silliest fight you've ever seen in your life.  But they -- neither one of them was willing to -- to give up and go away.  So ...
R:  Were they males or females, or one of each?
L:  Those were two males.
R:  Oh.
L:  They were trying to decide who, uh -- who had the rights to the ladies, um [LAUGH] -- the lady kittens -- the cats on the farm.  So ...
R:  Oh, God!  Yeah.  You help 'em out.
L:  I don't think I've ever had anything particularly exotic.  I was -- one time when we were looking in a pet shop and I see something like a boa constrictor or something or other --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [LAUGH] I always wonder who brings those home.
R:  Yeah.  I wonder about those kinda people, you know, 'cause it's kinda disgusting because, um, some of those boa constrictors they eat rabbits.
L:  Argh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, that would not be fun to have I don't think.
R:  No.  [LAUGH]  Rats and rabbits.
L:  My husband said he was, um -- my husband said that when he was going through the botanical gardens they had a chicken in the cage with the boa and, um, he said something about it to the -- whoever was guide- -- doing the guided tour and the guy said right now they're companions [LAUGH] and when --
R:  Oh, right now.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- when he gets hungry -- you've heard of fast food and so I think Jim asked if they may -- you know, he said, "Well, we hope that it doesn't happen when they're a lotta children going through on the tour".
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH] It'd be a little hard to explain to your child, you know?
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And I have a -- I have a high school -- I teach high school and I had one girl who said, um -- she was very excited, they were going to go get a pet and I said, "Oh, what are you gonna get?" and they -- they were going to get a snake.  So, I think her relationship with the snake lasted longer than the relationship with the guy who got her the snake.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, jeeze!
L:  And I'm not sure what her mother took, uh -- I always -- I wanted to ask and I had to keep biting my tongue -- I never did ask her, um, what Mom thought of having, um, a nice snake running around loose.  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  Well, a sorta snake running around loose.  I don't think -- and she did like to -- she said she liked to take it out of the cage and drape it around her neck.
R:  Mm.
L:  So ...
R:  I think a little pig would be nice to have.
L:  Wouldn't it be interesting?
R:  Yeah.  I hear they're cleaner than dogs or cats.
L:  Well, I know they're very intelligent.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I know there's a -- there's a farm -- there's at least two or three, but one I'm aware of in, uh, California that takes the, um -- the little potbelly pigs when they have outgrown cute --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and got to be two hundred pounds [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and people wanna get rid of them.
R:  Oh, God!
L:  It's like a retirement home for --
R:  Oh, dear!
L:  -- normal size potbelly pigs.  So, the little Vietnamese potbelly pigs appar- -- well, of course, they don't -- pigs at the rate of growth they have, um, then they stay cute and cuddly or cute and ugly cute cuddly for very long.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's been kinda interest- ...
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, it'd be nice if you could like, um, you know, breed pigs to be smaller and smaller and have like miniature pigs.
L:  You know, I think that that would be an interesting thing, wouldn't it, 'cause they -- they are quite smart and, as you say, they're, uh -- they're kinda neat little things so -- and I would guess they wouldn't chew on the furniture.  [LAUGH]  You could probably train 'em not to.
R:  Oh.  [NOISE] Yeah.  Yep.  Yeah.  I used to wanna ride a pig when I was little -- a kid and --
L:  Yeah.  Well, if they're big enough to.
R:  -- my neighbors had pigs.
L:  We never did, uh -- never did raise 'em and -- and so -- but I -- I -- my mother, uh, had one when she was growing up as a kid, they -- and they unfortunately, um -- she and the pig bonded quite well.  She would paint the thing's toenails and the whole thing.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  But, uh, nobody explained to her that the pig was eventually going to be say for supper --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and she said it was very traumatic [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- when -- when it came time for the pig to go -- go out to market and she said she, um -- and, nah, I don't think she became quite a vegetarian exactly over the winter but, uh, she wasn't very interested in bacon or ham or [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- or -- or pork chops, you know?
R:  When I was a kid I lived on a farm and we were eating steak one ev- evening at supper and I was like, "Oh, by the way, what happened to Hugo?"  I was about eight years old and my Dad was like, "You're eating him".
L:  [MN]
R:  [LAUGH] His wife said, "Oh, don't tell her that.  No, you're not eating Hugo".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But Hugo was gone.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, my husband used to raise, uh, chickens, pet chickens, and train them and check on, um -- he said he discovered the term pecking order and then when he went to --
