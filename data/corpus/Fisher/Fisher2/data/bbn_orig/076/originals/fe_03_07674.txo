R:  Hi, my name is Cindy.  I'm from Illinois.
L:  Hi, Cindy.  My name is Rebecca and I'm from Ohio.  How are you today?
R:  Fine.  How are you?  [LAUGH]
L:  Good.
R:  This is the first time I've got to talk to a female.  [LAUGH]
L:  Is it?
R:  Yeah.  Both other times were men.  [LAUGH]
L:  Wow!  Did you have to wait long today or ...?
R:  Oh, a couple -- three minutes, three, four minutes.
L:  Did you?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I waited like ten minutes.
R:  Oh, I've done that before and hung up.
L:  Have you?
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, so what about your life partner?
R:  Um, well, I'm married.  I've been married for twenty four years.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, great.
R:  How 'bout you?
L:  Well, I'm -- I was married for twenty three years and divorced [LIPSMACK] and I have, uh, a long term relationship now.  But, um -- so what -- what do you think, um, you owe to the success of your nice marriage?
R:  Um, lots of looking the other way [LAUGH] --
L:  Isn't that the truth?  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and patience and, uh, yeah, maybe just not sweating over the small stuff 'cause it will ...
L:  There's a lotta small stuff.  But what, um -- what do you think you and your husband have in common?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, the most thing that keeps you together?
R:  Uh, just that we're pretty -- basically pretty simple people and, uh, don't expect a lot outta the other one.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I've had two long term relationships.  One with my husband and, um [LIPSMACK], I know absolutely nothing about him.  Isn't that just ridiculous?
R:  Wow!  After twenty three years?
L:  I mean, and I met him in the second grade.  It was like the boy next door --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it was like twenty three years disaster.
R:  Wow!
L:  Isn't that just ...?
R:  [MN]
L:  It's overwhelming.  But this -- this, um -- and he finally -- I'm just -- you know, for the kids and for the religion and for everything I just hung in and hung in and hung in and so he just left, which is probably doing me a favor.  But -- and we just bought a house when it happened.
R:  Wow!
L:  So, then -- I'm in the house right now.  I kept it.  But then, um [LIPSMACK], I've just -- you know, I -- I guess I just stopped expecting anything, you know, and just sorta go with the flow and ...
R:  Mhm. 
L:  But that's interesting, isn't it?  You made it work and I didn't.
R:  Well [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- we were -- we dated all through high school.  So, we knew each other for a long time before we got married.
L:  Right.
R:  But you don't really know somebody 'til you marry 'em.  [LAUGH]
L:  And then I don't even know if you know 'em then.
R:  Well ...
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah, it's true.  Sometimes raising kids and all that stuff gets in the way and --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- you don't have time.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Were your kids like gone?
L:  Um [LIPSMACK], well, I -- are they now you mean?
R:  I mean when you divorced were your ...?
L:  Oh, no, they were like young teens.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, I just -- I had a good job thank goodness.  So, I just kept the house and kept the kids and, um, you know, just -- and I actually reaped all the benefits I think.  You know, because the kids, uh, now have their own children, they're here all the time, someone's here visiting and, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we've -- we're very close, uh, so -- and he's in Florida and, um [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- lord knows doing what.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, uh [LAUGH] -- but, you know, I -- I -- I did the work, but then I've got the benefits.
R:  Wow!
L:  You know?
R:  Huh.
L:  So, this is good for you because you can see the other side of the coin.
R:  Right.  Well, uh ...  [LAUGH]
L:  One of the disadvantages of my situation is the money.
R:  Oh, I'm sure.
L:  I mean, I -- I -- you know, like once he left for Florida, um, uh, you know, it was solely on me and that's hard.  Right now it's much easier --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because they're grown, they're, uh -- they all went through college.  I mean, they're just wonderful.
R:  Wow!
L:  But, um, uh, yeah, I'm tired, you know, I'm very tired.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Well, the money has certainly kept us t- --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- the money's -- the shortage of money that's certainly kept us together through a lotta things that probably had he we had the money wouldn't have, you know?
L:  And you know what I think too is where is the happy ever after, you know?
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Where is Prince Charming?
R:  [MN]
L:  You know, it's terrible to be in that -- that age bracket where you thought that was gonna happen --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- you know?
R:  Well, I have a sister who's in her forties still looking.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, she's divorced and looking for someone else and she still thinks that there's somebody out there like that.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I hope so.  I like to think so, you know?
R:  Boy!
L:  I like to think so.  I mean, my children seem -- you know, with -- with their mates they seem to really -- they're -- they're different about it than we were.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, they work.  [LIPSMACK]  I don't know.  They're -- they're very considerate.  They're very respectful.
R:  Well, you must've done something right.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, thank you and too bad it wasn't, you know, my own personal situation.  But, you know, I have a -- a friendship now, uh, a nice guy --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that sorta happened and, um -- but people say well, why -- you know, why don't you get married?  No way.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You learned your lesson, huh?
L:  My, uh, answer to that is I'd rather have a boyfriend than another husband.
R:  Wow!
L:  And, you know, it's not the same.
R:  No, I'm sure it's not.
L:  Not.
R:  I'm sure ...
L:  Definitely not.
R:  When you don't have that commitment --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that permanent commitment ...
L:  You're nicer.  You're ...
R:  Right.
L:  You know?
R:  It has to make a difference.
L:  Um [LIPSMACK], yeah, it's -- actually, you know, I've got a real good book within me.  I'd like to write one.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's spice.  I guess we all do, right?
R:  I'm sure.  I'm sure.  I sure would've done things differently.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  Exactly.
R:  Or looked for something different, you know?
L:  But what though, you know?
R:  Well ...  [LAUGH]
L:  And -- and you don't always even have to look.  Like I said, I knew him since the second grade and, you know, that's a long time.  I mean, I --
R:  Well, yeah.
L:  -- knew his family.  In fact I still am close to his -- his poor Mom who he put in a nursing home --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- three states away, which I say better her than me.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Not that I don't love her but, I mean, it's probably what he would do to me someday.  But ...  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, really, you know?
R:  Wow!
L:  I mean, if he already could leave the kids and me, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, I can laugh about it now, you know?  And isn't it funny how hindsight, I mean, you can see -- I see a whole lot of, uh, what goes round comes around, you know?
R:  Right.  Right.  Well, I spend a lotta time thinking oh, if only I could go back and know what I know now.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  But you're -- you're doing something right, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I give you a lotta credit.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I do.
R:  That's for hanging in there, huh?  [LAUGH]
L:  I give you a lot of cr- ...  I couldn't hang in though 'cause he -- you know, he finally made the --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the cut and that, like I said, he did me a favor.  Now I can see that.
R:  Well, and if he was capable of doing something like that you must not have known him.
L:  I could probably talk to you for the next four days.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Maybe they'd pay us four hundred dollars --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- to listen to this juicy conversation, right?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  No kidding.  But, yeah, uh, I -- that's just hard to believe that somebody you've been married to for that long would just take off.
L:  Well ...  But it's -- it happens every day and it wasn't just take off.  I mean, it took twenty three years of, you know ...?
R:  Right.
L:  I -- I just hung in that's all.
R:  Mhm.
L:  From day one, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  I closed my eyes and hung in and hung in because I thought that's what a nice wife and mother did.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um, but it happens every day and I'm just really happy that my kids seemingly have really good relationships, you know?
R:  Well, sounds like they've come out of it all right.
L:  Yeah, they have.  But that's the sad part, isn't it?
R:  Yeah, the kids.
L:  You have children?
R:  I have three.  Uh-huh.
L:  Well, see -- I have three also.  But, see -- see, you've done really good by them by having a stable -- hopefully stable marriage, you know?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I call that many years stable.
R:  Well ...  But, look, you were there for twenty three years and it wasn't stable.  [LAUGH]
L: Well, yeah.  But, um ...
R:  Well, years isn't always an indicator.
L:  But you know what's sad?  You know what's really sad?  Are all the wasted years.
R:  Right.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  That's a long time to ...
L:  I mean, I've lived like -- now I'm in my second lifetime and, you know, it's -- it's not by any means, um, perfect, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  But then is anything?
R:  No.  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know.
R:  Well, and that's just it.  If you go in expecting perfection you're not gonna get very far.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, but if you go in and expect nothing [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] I know.  So, what is the happy medium?
L:  -- you still don't get very [LAUGH] ...
R:  True.  I'm not sure what the answer is, but ...
L:  The answer is just plodding along.
R:  I guess and ...
L:  And laughing.
R:  Yeah.  You have to have a sense of humor that's ...
L:  This is interesting because I've told you more about my life than I've told anybody.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Isn't that ...?
R:  Well, it's easy to do to a stranger.  [LAUGH]
L:  Isn't it?
R:  Somebody who can't associate you with anything.
L:  But then also though you're -- you're very understanding.  You know what I mean?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I could be talking to a stranger that would not even comprehend what I was saying, you know?
R:  Right.  Right.  Wow!
L:  But ...  And with all the -- with all the really different kinds of relationships out there today it's interesting that [COUGH] at least when you're talking to somebody that is in something similar -- you know what I mean?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Know- knows reality.
L:  With a guy with --
R:  Yeah.
L: -- three kids, you know?  What are your kids, boys or girls?
R:  Um, I have a daughter who just graduated from college and a son who is in his second year of college and then we have a twelve year old.
L:  [LIPSMACK] That's nice.
R:  So ...
L:  I have [COUGH] a daughter, um, that has two daughters or her own and her husband's a pharmacist.  They live in Virginia.  Then I have a son who happens to be here to- --
