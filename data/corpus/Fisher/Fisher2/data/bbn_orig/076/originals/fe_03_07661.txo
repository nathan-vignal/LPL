R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, [MN] I'm Jenny.
R:  Uh, I'm Ralph.
L:  Nice to m- -- talk to you. [MN]
R:  [MN] Nice talk to you too.
L:  [LAUGH] So, do you have a pet?
R:  I don't have one right now, um, 'cause of living in an apartment --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I had one before I -- my parents had one when I was growing up --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, do you have one?
L:  No, I don't either, actually I -- I just had a dog, probably I got rid of him about a month ago.  Um, he was a beagle and he was a stray, my aunt and uncle found him, so I took him in for a couple of months and [SIGH] I thought he was a little bit older than what he was, he was -- it ended up he was only a puppy and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I just didn't have the energy for him and I was never home, so I ended up giving him to a family with kids and so I fel- I felt sad about giving him up, but I was also glad that he'd have somebody that'd pay attention to and stuff like that, so ...
R:  Do you live by yourself then, I guess?
L:  Yeah, mhm, I do.  So, and I'm never home, I work all day and then, [SIGH] seeing, like, I have meetings, like, at least three nights a week, so, um, [LIPSMACK] I'm just never home, so, um --
R:  Yeah, it's the -- it's the same thing with me is I, uh -- I'm -- I -- I work all day and right now I can't have a pet, I'm, um, I don't -- I mean, I can have one in my -- my apartment, but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [SIGH] I think if I take one in it wouldn't be, like, fair to the p- -- to the dog either --
L:  Yeah, that's exac- --
R:  -- um --
L:  --I -- I used to live in an apartment too and that's how I was too, I just -- would feel bad about having it cooped up all day.
R:  Do you have a yard now?
L:  Yeah, I do.  Actually, my yard's fenced in --
R:  Yeah --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- well, that's good for pets, but, uh, if y- -- if you're not there though for them, it -- it kind of sucks though, for them --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and for you, 'cause they don't really -- I know, too, if you, um -- if you lock up a dog or if you chain 'em up on the, uh -- and just keep him on a chain all day, even if you keep him outside, that that actually makes them more aggressive and makes them more, I guess, uh, scared -- I don't know if --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's scared of humans, or, like, aggressive against humans, but --
L:  D- -- yeah.
R:  -- 'cause I used to have a dog like that, that was next to me in college where y- y- you couldn't even walk down the street, uh, next to this dog, it was out twelve hours a day at least --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it would just, uh, start barking, you couldn't even go near it, I mean, I -- I was never afraid of dogs, that's, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I've been bitten a couple of times, I think I li- -- like, I -- I'd bumps and I was afraid of 'em, I think it's why I was bitten a couple of time 'cause I just -- I'd go up to a dog and all, but --
L:  Yeah, that's how I've -- we always had dogs growing up and, um, I was the same way, I mean, I'm not afraid of dogs, but, [SIGH] I just -- I just felt so guilty leaving him, 'cause well, it was winter too when I had that dog, so I had to keep him in the basement 'cause it's too --
R:  Uh.
L:  -- cold to put him outside and [SIGH] it was just so hard, but, I mean, I -- I don't know --
R:  Did he chew anything up or anything like that --
L:  Yes, and he'd --
R:  -- when you were out?
L:  -- pee all over the place too, 'cause he --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- as- -- you know, he didn't want to go outside 'cause it was cold, to go to the bathroom, so he just p- -- I had hard wood floors, but I have carpet remnants, so on the corner of, like, all the carpet remnant he would pee --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- jus- -- I don't know why he would -- what the deal was with the corner, but he just loved that so [MN] that was ano- -- I mean, and he -- he tore up my sheets, he tore up --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- stuffed animals he drug out from -- I don't even know where they even were at in my house, but he found 'em and he, [SIGH] I mean, he just loved to just -- anything he could his hands on -- and I think he did it more for attention, just because if I wasn't paying attention to him, he'd chew on something he wasn't supposed to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and so I would pay attention to him [LIPSMACK] --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, yeah, I know, that's how, uh, uh, uh -- that's how my parents' dogs are -- ther- -- my parents' dog is too, it's like a -- [SIGH] there par- -- their dog is, like, a little -- it's a g- -- lhasa apso -- I don't know --
L:  Oh yeah, I know what those are --
R:  -- if -- they're like big mops --
L:  -- uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah.
R:  -- and, uh, it -- they're -- they're like real protective and stuff like -- not protective, but, like, i- if you -- if you give him a, uh, toy or buy him ki- -- anything new, [SIGH] then, when he gets it, the day -- the f- first day, all day he gets it, he sits underneath of, uh, of a table, like, a coffee table --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and any time anyone enters the room at all, he'll start growling, like, they're gonna --  like, they're making --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they're not even anywhere near him, but it'll start growling like he's -- like they're coming, uh, you c- coming after it --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it's, uh, i- i- it sucks to have, like, kids and stuff over, like that -- that get scared of the dog --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- wh- -- I don't want to -- I definitely want to get another dog d- -- but I don't want to get, like, a little dog like that, I want to get a big dog.  I want to get a [MN] -- I want to get, like, a doberman, maybe, or a rottweiler --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or a german shepherd, something like that --
L:  My parents have a boxer --
R:  -- yeah, I like boxers too.
L:  -- and he -- and the- -- is really is a good dog.  They -- they look kind of scary, you know, everybody's really scared of him 'cause they just look mean, but [SIGH] that dog really is the best dog, I mean, [SIGH] he is -- he's big and just lovable and [SIGH] when I used to live with my parents I had a twin bed there and h- -- that dog, I mean, it stood, you know, pretty high, like, up to my waist and [SIGH] he would sleep in the twin bed with me, he just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, he just -- he was a really good dog.
R:  Yeah, my -- my neighbor has a, uh, boxer and it -- it -- my -- were my parents' neighbor actually and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, the whole time when I was still living there I used to pat him all the time, used to go outside, pat him, he'd -- he'd be sitting on the step with my neighbors and all, I would pat him and all and -- and I guess after I'd moved away he forgot, I guess, who I was after a while from not being there all the time and now, any time I go near him, he starts to lunge at me, like he --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- tried to attack me [MN] --
L:  -- did he go at, like, your Achilles tendon?
R:  -- nah, well, he's on a leash, he's on a leash every time I see him, so --
L:  Oh, uh-huh.
R:  -- every time, you kn- -- I -- I can't go near him now.  I can't, eh, eh, er, like, and my parents' yards are fenced in, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- right next to theirs, so if I go outside, he's out there and he sees me --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- he'll start barking and then growling at me, trying to get at me, but, like, my --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- brother or my parents or, you know, anyone that still lives there is, uh -- yeah, they're -- they're -- he's -- he's as friendly as he can be --
L:  Yes, yeah, he's fine.
R:  -- with them.  He's huge too, [MN] but --
L:  Yeah, I -- I know our dog wouldn't -- well, at my parents' house when anybody came and -- and, like, if he didn't know that we knew them, he would lunge at their -- like their Achilles tendon, like try to snap it --
R:  Really?
L:  -- or bite at that.  Mhm [MN] --
R:  At the Achilles tendon?
L:  -- h- -- yeah, I mean --
R:  That -- that could be really -- h- hurt you, couldn't it? 
L:  -- I know, I know and, I mean, we just knew just to kick him and he bit one of my dad's friends one time and my -- and I was there, I guess I must have not paid attention as the guy had came in and [SIGH] he called our house, like, after he went back home, he's like, "Your dog bit me" and I'm like, "What?" and he's like, "He bit me and it drew blood", I'm like, "Well, I'm sorry" --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I'm like, "Didn't you know to kick him, everybody else knows?" and, I don't know, I mean, he didn't hurt the guy --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or anything, but, it was just weird, that -- that's what that dog does, he would just go for your -- like, if you thought that you weren't, like -- if -- if -- if he thought it was, like, a stranger, like, or something like that and, like --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- once he thought that we knew the people or whatever, he'd be fine, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and that -- that dog was bad about -- when he got excited he would pee everywhere, I mean --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- he would just pee right on your shoes or wherever.  That -- that's the only bad thing about that dog, but --
R:  Well, do you -- do you ever think -- do you want a go -- dog, like, you s- -- live by yourself, do you ever think about getting a dog just to have in the house, like, for protection?
L:  You know, I [MN] -- where I live is -- my neighborhood's really quiet and it's full of, like, older people and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- it's really well lit, so, I really don't even think about anything like that for -- it's like, for protection, I mean, I'm not -- I -- I leave my doors unlocked when I leave, I don't really worry about it.
R:  Yeah, I thou- -- I live in Philadelphia and, uh, I live, like, in the actual city, so --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- dis- -- uh, I mean, whe- -- where my parents' house is, [NOISE] growing up, like, it was a little bit -- it was more like on the outside that they c- -- still in the city but in --in, like a d- -- a, uh, like a real good neighborhood, like they never had any crime or anything like that --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  Um, and even like down here, like, where I am, I'm a little [several inaudible words] in the city now, but it's [SIGH] -- it's not really dangerous, I mean, I've never had anyone break in here --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or anything like that.  I've been living here for, I think, like, two and a half years now --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, [SIGH] uh, I still just, uh, would always wan- -- I know, like, when I get married, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't -- I always tell my girlfriend, I said, "I'm getting -- I'm getting a dog for protection" and, you know, [MN] like I tell -- she doesn't re- -- she doesn't really want one, but I want one just for my peace of mind --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just for, like, wh- -- if I'm not around, you know, the bottom line is any kind of security system you have, any ki- and again, like, that can always fail, but a dog is -- n- -- a- -- that's why one reason I want a big dog, uh, plus I like big dogs, they're --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they're not going to fail, if there's -- I mean, I -- I had a friend, uh, a couple of weeks ago [SIGH] where, um, [MN] he's -- his wife just had a baby and then, uh -- so she's home with a newborn all day and -- and she was home, um, actually and there's a lady -- a girl that lives across the street from her, she was home also and they had someone that was coming round, I guess, trying to sell something, but it was really fishy --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, uh, the person that, uh, the girl that lives across the street her -- her husband came home from work for lunch -- just happened to come home, normally doesn't come home and he was sitting there in the middle of the, uh, day and this guy, doesn't even knock on the door, just walks in the door and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- the guy's standing there and if this -- if this guy wasn't home, then who knows what would have happened --
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  -- you know, and in that kind of case if you have a dog, that is, uh -- that's really a kind of defence --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I mean, [SIGH] no one gets near -- that -- that's one of the biggest thing is it's for p- protec- -- uh, not just for protection, 'cause I like, you know, all kinds of dogs --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, but to have it as, like, for peace of mind for myself, like, if I had a -- a kid and a wife or something home by themselves --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, I would be -- I would -- I would definitely feel better having a dog there. [MN]
L:  Yeah, and I think I'm a little bit --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- not necessarily naive, but I just don't think about that kind of stuff all --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the time, 'cause I just -- I guess, I'm just really comfortable with where I'm at, so I just don't even worry about it --
R:  Yeah, it's --
L:  -- I live about an hour from Saint Louis --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so, I'm kind of -- I'm in a -- uh, my town's about forty thousand people, so --
R:  Yeah, it's the -- I guess, it's just a lot different growing up there n- -- and -- or eve- -- but if -- but if you grew up in Saint Louis and like that, it might be a little bit different, but, uh --
L:  Yeah, and -- and I didn't grow up in the city, so -- 
R:  Yeah, but it -- and -- but it's weird, it's not like I've ever had anyone ever break into any of my houses or anything like -- my -- my parent's house or not even anywhere in my street or anything that I know of, but just hearing any kind of th- -- just seeing stuff on the news, you know, where --
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  -- just one random house, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- who knows, and the stuff that happens in the suburbs too, it doesn't just happen in the city, but [MN] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the only thing is it's just, uh, and I -- I talk about it all the time, about getting -- getting a dog, uh, you know, a little bit later and, um, it -- it's always like a -- like it's a battle, 'cause I don't know if I -- I don't know if I -- I mean, I want one for reasons like that and plus I just like dogs and the only thing is [MN] everyone tells me that the -- everyone that has dogs, "Don't get a dog" --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- they say, "You can't go on vacation --"
L:  Yeah, that's [MN] --
R:  "-- y- you can't do anything".
L:  -- I remember that too 'cause right after I got  my dog, I had to go somewhere for work, I had to be gone for a week, I had to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- take the train and everything so I took him to th- -- w- w- -- here we have this thing, it's like a pet hotel thing and [SIGH] they don't put him in, like, a kennel, they put him in, like, a, um, little room with, like, a pillow and --
R:  Oh, that's cool.
L:  -- it's just a little bit nicer than the kennel, but, [SIGH] I mean, the bill is just outrageous for it.  I mean, I felt better doing it that way, but then again, I mean, [SIGH] just stuff like that, that you don't think about and then, here you are, you're shelling out money left and right, you know, to take care of the dog and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, you don't -- you don't want to leave him in the kennel 'cause it's kind of mean to leave him in those cages all the time, so, I mean, I'm going to do it that --
