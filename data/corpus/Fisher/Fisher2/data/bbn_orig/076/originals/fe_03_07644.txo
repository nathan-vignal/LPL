R:  Hello.
L:  [MN]
R:  I'm Amanda from Florida.
L:  I'm Rick.  I'm up in Minneapolis.
R:  [NOISE] So, do you have a pet? [LAUGH]
L:  Not at all.
R:  No?
L:  I grew up with one but, uh, kind of, uh, don't have one now.  Parents still have one.  How about you?
R:  [NOISE] I raise Chinese cresteds.
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  So -- I raise Chinese cresteds.
L:  W- -- and those are ...
R:  They're little hairless --
L:  ... birds?
R:  -- dogs.
L:  Huh?
R:  No, they're dogs.  Dogs.
L:  Oh, dogs?  Okay, never heard of that --
R:  They're little hairless dogs.
L:  Okay.  I never heard of that brand -- or, uh, breed I mean.  Brand.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So, what do you get [inaudible] --
R:  Yeah, they're the ones --
L:  Oh, well, boy --
R:  They just have the hair on the head. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  We got a delay here on this, uh ... on this conversation, I can tell.  Kind of, uh, talking on each other thing.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Uh, sounds like a water sprinkler in the background.  Must be outside.
R:  It's raining. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  What part of Florida is it -- are, uh -- are -- are you in?
R:  I'm in Orlando.
L:  Oh, okay.  So, um, they have a little tuft of hair on their head?
R:  Yeah, they have hair on their head, their feet and their tail.
L:  Oh, interesting.  And how many do you have?
R:  Right now I have eight.
L:  Mm.
R:  I have four older ones and I have a litter that's five weeks old.  I have four -- four puppies in the litter.
L:  And, uh, there's a pretty steady market for them, I guess?
R:  Um, yeah, there's actually -- for the hairless there's a pretty go- [LAUGH] good market.
L:  Really?  Well, yeah, you get the, uh, people who are allergic, you know, obviously, probably are a big -- big component.
R:  Yeah.  Um, they're -- and they're different too, so ...
L:  The unique factor, sure.  Yeah, we always grew up with dogs, uh, [SIGH] different dogs over the years, uh ... uh, but, you know, I -- I live in an apartment right now so ... um, I've never been much of a cat guy. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Or birds or ferrets or, uh, thankfully no prairie dogs.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, I don't know if you've heard about that out in Wisconsin but, uh [inaudible] --
R:  I used to work in a pet store and we had little prairie dogs come in. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, well, they were, uh, spreading some monkey pox.
R:  Oh.
L:  This is, uh, lately out in Wisconsin.  I -- of all the pets I would have ever thought to own, I don't even think prairie dogs --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- would have ever registered.  Oh, but, eh, --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- each to their own.
R:  I thought about getting a sp- -- a skunk a w- -- a while ago. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  We had those come in.
L:  A skunk?
R:  A s- -- little skunk.  They de-scent 'em so they can't spray you. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, that's a good thing I guess.
R:  [MN]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They're supposed to be kind of like a cat or a dog.  Kind of a mix.
L:  Okay.  And, uh ... well, I guess.  I mean -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  If they're, uh, house bred or whatever, you know, house trained.
R:  And they're supposed to go in a litter box.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  So ...
L:  C- -- huh.
R:  I thought it would be a strange pet. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Something different.
L:  Yeah, I -- I -- [LAUGH] [several inaudible words].  I mean, I wouldn't mind if I ever had a house getting another dog but, uh ... you know, it's a time commitment obviously too and, um ... are those dogs pretty easy to, uh, you know, set up and train and house break or, you know, whatever?
R:  They're not -- any toy breed is difficult to house +break -- [LAUGH] house break but --
L:  Oh.
R:  But they're good otherwise [LAUGH] ...
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  You just have to watch 'em ... all the time.  I don't ever let 'em out without watching 'em. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.  Yeah --
R:  Yeah, it's like I -- I almost moved into an apartment.  I thought it would be too hard to try to walk dogs.  I just can't handle that. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  Well, you'd be quite the, uh, sight to see with all those dogs on, uh, multiple leashes going down the street, I'm sure.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Sometimes I take two at a time and they [LAUGH] kind of get tangled up and ...
L:  Ah. [LAUGH]
R:  It's kind of funny. [LAUGH] But it -- it kind of keeps me from going too many places though, 'cause when I go somewhere I have to decide what I'm going to do with the dogs or take 'em all with me.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And that's kind of hard.  I -- I had two for a while and that, you know, that's easier to take but four is a little harder.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I would imagine so.  I barely have time to take myself for a walk, let alone a pet. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I don't ever really take 'em for a walk.  Sometimes I'll take 'em to the park but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I sort of have to have a house so I have a yard 'cause I don't -- in the morning I don't have to do anything. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  I barely have time to put 'em out and then go get 'em and put 'em back in. [LAUGH]
L:  Sure.  Yeah, I know with a -- another thing with the pets, you know, e- -- well, if you do travel, it's like, "Okay, what's going to go on?  Do -- do I get somebody to watch 'em or do I put 'em in a kennel or ...?  You know, can they handle, like, two days alone by them- -- you know, if I give 'em a big old bo-, you know, bowl of food, you know?"  That's -- that's one guy's, uh, dilemma, a friend of mine's.  Uh, he was going to do some, uh, rock concert touring, uh, support, you know, production support and it's like, uh, "Okay, how long can I leave my cats alone?" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, so -- but it is a concern.
R:  Yeah.  And it's expensive to put 'em in a kennel.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Especially with more than one dog. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I -- I found out something when I was house sitting for a friend and -- and also dog sitting at the same time.  I, uh, soon came across, or heard about, the phrase "separation anxiety", which I'd never heard of before.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Because the dog kept leaping out at -- through windows and getting out through other various ways and just was not behaving normally.  [LIPSMACK] You know, I -- I guess it was because of that anxiety.
R:  Yep.
L:  I mean, I was good to him.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I liked him.  I even taught him when he was a puppy how to shake hands.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Go on, he shouldn't get too freaked out.  But I guess he did.
R:  Yeah, well, any change kind of disrupts their whole routine. [LAUGH]
L:  I would imagine --
R:  They don't like it.
L:  "I want my food now.  Feed me now, feed me again --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- and then, uh, feed me later".
R:  [LAUGH] They always jump on me.
L:  They like to jump?
R:  Scratch me on the back.  Uh, they'll -- well, yeah.  I have one that's really a jumper.
L:  Well --
R:  He jumps way up.
L:  [LAUGH] Now, how big do they get again -- I don't know if you told me this; if you did I'm totally brain dead.
R:  They're a toy breed.
L:  Uh -- uh --
R:  They're -- they get anywhere from six to fifteen pounds.
L:  Okay.  So ... be good for -- good, uh, for people living in, um, more enclosed spo- spaces too, like townhouses or whatever, if need be.
R:  Yeah.  They could -- they could live in a p- -- in an apartment --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if someone would walk them in the morning, but [LAUGH] ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know, I'm one of those people that -- I get up and I leave. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh.
R:  I don't take a lot of time in the morning and I certainly don't get up early. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, neither do I.  I work late and get up late so it's, like, uh, I don't know if I'd, uh ... I don't know if the dog would like me coming in -- or any pet -- coming in at, uh, two AM after working, uh, concert security and, uh ... of course, they probably would wanna get rocking and rolling at six AM and I'd be like, "Get outta here".
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Uh, and then all of a sudden --
R:  We- well, on Saturdays I try to sleep in and they wanna wake me up. [LAUGH] I'm like --
L:  Yeah, I don't need that ac- --
R:  " [inaudible] the bed".
L:  I don't need that, uh, animalistic alarm clock in my life right now.
R:  [MN]
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, they finally got a hold of me tonight.  I'm usually not home so I'm glad, uh ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Got this calling and calling and calling and [SIGH] ... and of course now there's a topic that I can --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- only -- ah, there's a -- there's a dog, uh --
R:  [inaudible] Yeah, [inaudible] taking her to dog class now. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, there --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- there we go.  They're -- they're, uh, adding into the equation then too.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  Bo- boy, I wonder how the, uh, computers or whatever, the speech recognition --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- uh, computers are going to dig that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, [LAUGH] boy --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Um ... [NOISE] oh, I don't know. [SIGH]
R:  I show --
L:  I had a friend of mine who --
R:  I show these guys so ...
L:  Yeah.  Well, uh, the weirdest pet a friend of mine's ever -- or that I've ever come across is a friend of mine had a piranha for a while.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, but, uh ... I don't know, I think a prairie dog is almost weirder.  Maybe skunk.  I think that might even be weirder still.
R:  [LAUGH] I had a pot bellied pig for a little while too. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I think, you know, that's not too -- that was kind of trendy, you know, I -- I think --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- some Hollywood people were doing those too.  But, uh, you know ... uh, I don't know, that -- [MN] it's kind of nice to see a different breed I hadn't seen for a while, just like a had -- saw a bird out in the wild I hadn't seen ever.  I had to go look it up in a book, you know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's like -- I like animals, you know, it's, um, it's unfortunate so many of 'em have to g- get, um, put down, you know, lost and not claimed, whatever.  And, uh ... [LIPSMACK] you know, the ... I'd -- I'm running out of things to say and I hope the ten minutes --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- sure as heck, uh, goes by.  So I'll let you do some more talking. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know.
L:  [MN] I know with these topics it's like, "Oh, God, I --" you know, I've missed some good ones, you know, I really know some of the [inaudible] ones like pets [several inaudible words]. [SIGH]
R:  [MN] This --
L:  Like 'em, don't have one.  Okay, next topic. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Now, this one's not too bad 'cause I've had a whole lot of pets. [LAUGH] I used to have, um, rats too and pet mice and ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I had the little short tailed possum.
L:  R- [MN] okay --
R:  Um --
L:  Orlando is an interesting little pet area, I guess. [LAUGH]
R:  And I ha- -- I had hedgehogs.  I had all kinds of stuff.
L:  Hedgehogs are kind of neat looking.
R:  Yeah.  And I used to have one that, um -- well, I had a pair and then one of 'em had, uh, babies.  And she would let me touch them when they were just born. [LAUGH] Normally with hedgehogs if you touch the babies when they're first born, they'll eat them.
L:  Ah.
R:  But she wouldn't eat them. [LAUGH] She'd let me touch 'em, so ...
L:  She wa- --
R:  The babies were always real sweet.
L:  She wasn't too hungry, I guess.
R:  No, well, she was a good momma. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, that's good.  Well, I haven't been to a pet store, uh, um, [MN] well, other than, you know, a couple in the mall, I didn't even think some of this --
