L:  Leah[?].
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Uh, my name's Frank, I'm in Philadelphia.
L:  Hi, my name's Leah, I'm in Boston.
R:  Ah, what a nice town.
L:  Yeah, when it's not pouring rain out and gross but it -- [LAUGH]
R:  Well, that's what Philadelphia's been like for the last two months too.
L:  Oh, really?  Are you right in Philadelphia or, ah, outside?
R:  Right in town, yeah.
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH]
L:  Huh.
R:  Do you have a pet?
L:  A pe- -- I do, I have a cat but she's at my parent's house in New York so ...
R:  Why?
L:  Well, it's my family's pet and I moved out here to go to school so ...
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  She's kind of there, hanging out.
R:  So, you're in Boston.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Are you really in Boston or outside of Boston?
L:  Um, I go to school in downtown Boston, I've lived in downtown Boston for two years but --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I moved out to Brighton which is in, like, the outskirts.  It's still considered Boston though because the train goes there and all that stuff.
R:  Okay.  Well, I have a dog.  I used to have two.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yes.  And one of them ... the first one got very old and decrepit and then one day he just couldn't walk any more.
L:  Oh.
R:  Trauma for me, probably more so than for him.
L:  Oh.  What kind of dogs were they or are they?
R:  Well, he was -- he was a ... the vet said that he was probably a cross between a blue merle collie and a husky.
L:  Ooh.
R:  D- do you -- you know what a blue merle collie is?  You know what ...
L:  I know what a collie is, like, are they kind of the same thing?
R:  All right, now, have you ever seen the -- the collies that are kind of, like, white and they have black markings on them?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's blue merle.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  That's it.  It -- because the color is blue, it's like a -- a -- a slate gray color or something.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, he was a ... looked like a collie that had, uh, been pulling sleds or something, I don't know.
L:  Oh, so he must have been beautiful then.
R:  He was an absolutely beautiful dog.  And the one I have now is a samoyed, a female.
L:  Are those, like, the big ones and they're white?
R:  They're the big white ones that look like ... um, they're pure white.
L:  Okay.  I got you.
R:  And they're mostly just fur.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  All over the place, fur.
L:  Cool.  Um, and what's her name?
R:  Her name is Bea.
L:  Bea?
R:  Bea.
L:  Like Bea Arthur?
R:  Sort of.  It was supposed to be something else but, uh, it en- ended up being Bea.  Ah ...
L:  [inaudible]
R:  ... she was the one [inaudible] ... found her in Fairmount Park.  She was a th- throwaway.
L:  Oh.
R:  S-, uh, a pure- ... purebred dog --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- that probably somebody got for Christmas.  And found, ah, found her in Fairmount Park [several inaudible words] at the softball fields.
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  And took her home and cleaned her up and ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  So ... now she's a dog that doesn't know how to play but wants to play.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  [inaudible] if that makes -- she doesn't know to play dog games with people.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, like, if I toss her a ball it hits her in the face.
L:  Oh.
R:  And then she'll go pick it up and run away with it.
L:  Ah.
R:  As opposed to picking it up ...
L:  And bringing it back. [LAUGH]
R:  The other dog I had would pick it up and throw it back at me.
L:  Really?
R:  So ... [MN]
L:  How did it do that?  Just kind of like arch its head back and chuck it?
R:  It -- yeah, put his head back and just throw it.
L:  That's so cool.
R:  Yeah.  It was a neat dog.
L:  Did you like him better than you like your new -- your other dog or ...?
R:  They're two different things, two different things.
L:  Oh.  Apples and oranges.
R:  Yes.  This w- -- this -- this one who is still here is -- she's funny.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know if that makes -- she -- she -- she makes me laugh.
L:  Aw.
R:  It's just the way she acts and stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The other one was kind of like a pal.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So it's apples and oranges.
L:  Yeah.  My roommate has goldfish.
R:  Goldfish.
L:  Yeah, that's our other pet.  Do you have --
R:  I used to have them when I was a little kid.
L:  Yeah, she has a beta and then she has another goldfish and the beta used to attack the goldfish but now they're friends we think.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, but the goldfish has ick.
R:  Ew.
L:  Yeah, it's gross.  Like, it's got white spots all over it and we think it's infected and it might infect the beta and, like ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  [inaudible] and stuff.  You know.
R:  Beta's are weird fish.  It's a male beta or a female?
L:  I'm not really sure.  Um, I don't know how to tell the difference.  I don't know if you can, like, turn it over [LAUGH] and look at it --
R:  [LAUGH] No, no --
L:  -- [several inaudible words] or anything.
R:  -- if -- if you -- if you can get a mirror ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  ... so that the beta sees itself in the mirror.
L:  Mhm.
R:  If -- and if it's a male it will think it's looking at another male.  And all the --
L:  Oh, and then it freaks out kind of?
R:  I- -- y- -- well, yeah, what happens is the -- all these colors start to come out on it and -- and it just kind of like puffs itself up.
L:  Oh, then it must be a female 'cause we tried putting a mirror up to it and it kind of ignored it.
R:  Oh, maybe it is female.
L:  And we just thought it was a boring beta. [LAUGH]
R:  No, maybe it's a female.
L:  Yeah.  We wanna get, like, two or three betas and just put 'em in the same tank together. [LAUGH]
R:  N- no, no, no, [LAUGH] no- not unless you'd like blood.
L:  Yeah, that's what we wanna see, we wanna charge people to watch it.
R:  Y- -- get a sh- -- get yourself a shark and put it in there; it'll take care of that for you.
L:  Ooh.
R:  No.
L:  Cool.
R:  No, no.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  When I was a little kid I had a beta.
L:  Oh.
R:  And it would eat guppies.
L:  That's gross.
R:  Well, it's ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  ... no worse than deciding you wanna put two of them in the same -- two males in the same tank and watch 'em rip [inaudible] -- uh, each other --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- a pie- -- to pieces.
L:  That's true. [LAUGH]
R:  And they will. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I'd just kind of like to see it once just to see what it's like.
R:  Oh, well ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Go to a pet store with a net and don't let them catch you.
L:  [LAUGH] That's a good idea.  I think we'll have to try that next time we go out. [LAUGH]
R:  But, uh ... so, what's your d-, uh, cat's name?
L:  My cat's name is Ramona.
R:  Ramona.
L:  Yeah, we -- I used to have another cat --
R:  For the song?
L:  No, I used to have another cat and her name was Beezus, like the Beverly Cleary book.
R:  Don't know that.
L:  They're, like -- um, not like little kids books but, like, chapter books for, like, [inaudible] third and fourth grade aged kids.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And Ramona and Beezus were sisters.
R:  Oh.
L:  And so we had the cats but Beezus had cancer, like ...
R:  Ew.
L:  ... four years ago, maybe.  So we had to get her put to sleep.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  She was funny.  She used to get, like -- she liked foil balls.  And she'd carry them around in her mouth and, like, if you threw them to her she'd catch them with her paws.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  And then my parents were cleaning the house one day -- and they always wondered where the foil balls went.  They lifted up the couch and she had arranged the foil balls from biggest to smallest in a line. [LAUGH]
R:  Did she really?
L:  Yeah.  I mean, under the couch.  I know that's crazy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And she could play dead.  Like, you'd put her on her back and she'd stay there.  But now she's not playing anymore, so [LAUGH] ...
R:  Well, now she's playing with God.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The ultimate, uh, cat lover I guess.
L:  Uh-huh, I guess so.  And Ramona's really fat and she has this flap on skin on her stomach and when she runs it wobbles from side to side.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And my [inaudible] told that she looks like she has an alien in her stomach.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And that's the running joke with my cat.
R:  Be careful she doesn't end up with diabetes.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  Seriously.  I d- -- I know a woman who has a cat that was terribly obese and she ended up having to give the thing, uh, insulin injections for years.
L:  Oh, that's what happened with my grandmother's cat before it died.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  Her other cat ended up with, like, matted fur on its back and she looked like she had a dorsal fin.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And they had to cut it off.
R:  Right.  Poor [inaudible].
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well ... [LIPSMACK]
L:  Mm.
R:  What are you studying?
L:  I'm studying marketing communication with a minor in political communication.
R:  What is marketing communication?
L:  Um ...
R:  See, I -- when I went to college we majored in things like English and science and ...
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  ... mathematics and ...
L:  Mhm.  Marketing communication's like marketing advertising, public relations ... um --
R:  Uh, really?
L:  Yeah.  You just basically take a lot of speech classes and then introductory classes into different fields of marketing and find which one you like.
R:  Eh.
L:  You know, I don't know if it's the same at all schools or anything.  I mean ...
R:  Yeah, the only marketing -- the only marketing curriculum I know anything about is the one at Saint Jo's University here in Philadelphia.
L:  Oh.
R:  They started years ago, in fact they may have been one of the early ... one of the early, uh, pioneers in the thing, a thing on food marketing.
L:  Oh.  Like, what does that entail, just --
R:  I -- it was, you know, basically the same thing: how to, uh ... it had nothing to do with supermarkets.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It was, uh, you know, advertising and the kind of pictures you want and how to present food at -- you know --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- in terms of language and colors and all of this stuff.
L:  Mm.  So was it, like, more of, like, a restaurant, like, preparing meals and stuff like that?
R:  No.  No, no, no, no.
L:  Oh.
R:  No, it was --
L:  Oh, like just food products?
R:  Food product stuff, yeah.
L:  So, like, was there a lot of packaging and layout and stuff like that?
R:  Right.
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  [NOISE]
