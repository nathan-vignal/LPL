AND UH BUT IT IS FUN I MEAN I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER I MEAN WATCHING HOCKEY ON TELEVISION IS  (fe_03_07607-A-0062)
IS ONE THING AND THAT'S ONE THING I CAN SAY ABOUT WATCHING HOCKEY ON TELEVISION IT'S VERY DIFFERENT TO BEING AT THE GAME NUMBER ONE YOU HAVE AN ANNOUNCER NUMBER TWO THE PUCK IS MOVING VERY FAST THE CAMERAMAN KNOWS WHERE THE PUCK IS 'CAUSE HE HE'S WATCHED ENOUGH HOCKEY TO KNOW WHERE THE PUCK IS GONNA BE SO THE CAMERA FOLLOWS THE PUCK  (fe_03_07607-A-0063)
WHEN YOU'RE IN THE ARENA THE WHISTLE BLOWS YOU DON'T KNOW WHY THERE'S NO ANNOUNCER AND UM  (fe_03_07607-A-0064)
SOMETIMES YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THE PUCK IS AND SOMETIMES THERE'S A LOT OF ACTIVITY BUT IT'S NOT NEAR THE PUCK SOMETIMES THEY'LL BE HAVING A FIGHT OR WHATEVER BUT UH  (fe_03_07607-A-0065)
IT'S NOT  (fe_03_07607-A-0066)
WHERE THE PUCK IS THE PLAY UH IT'S BEHIND THE PLAY  (fe_03_07607-A-0067)
SO IT'S UH  (fe_03_07607-A-0068)
IT'S VERY DIFFERENT IT'S YOU HAVE TO REALLY PAY ATTENTION YOU HAVE TO REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO BE ABLE TO WATCH  (fe_03_07607-A-0069)
YEAH BECAUSE YOU YOU DON'T HAVE SOMEONE TO  (fe_03_07607-A-0070)
YEP YEP  (fe_03_07607-A-0071)
YEP  (fe_03_07607-A-0072)
BUT UH WITH HOCKEY YOU REALLY HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION BECAUSE THE PUCK MOVES SO FAST AND YOU HAVE TO AND THE THING IS YOU CAN EASILY GO TO A HOCKEY GAME AND AND REALLY BE LOST BECAUSE  (fe_03_07607-A-0073)
YOU HAVE TO KINDA ANTICIPATE WHERE YOU THINK THE PUCK IS GONNA BE AND THE PLAYERS MOVE SO FAST IT'S POSSIBLE THAT IF YOU ANTICIPATE THE WRONG PLACE YOU'LL MISS THE WHOLE PLAY UM ESPECIALLY IF THE PLAY'S IN FRONT OF THE NET  (fe_03_07607-A-0074)
IT DEPENDS WHICH IT DEPENDS WHAT YOU WANT FROM THE GAME UM I LIKE TO SIT HIGHER UP BECAUSE I LIKE THE PERSPECTIVE I LIKE TO REALLY I SIT RIGHT BEHIND THE GOAL I CAN SEE THE GOAL TENDING I REALLY LOVE THE GOAL TENDING  (fe_03_07607-A-0075)
UM SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO SIT CLOSE AND FEEL THE GRIT OF THE GAME YOU KNOW THEY WANNA SEE THE GUY SLAM UP IN FRONT OF ON THE BOARDS RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM UM  (fe_03_07607-A-0076)
THOSE ARE THOSE ARE YOU BUT THE PROBLEM IS YOU SIT LOW AND AND JUST AS YOU THEY'RE 'CAUSE THE THE RINK IS ROUND IT'S AN OVAL THERE YOU ACTUALLY IF YOU THERE ARE PLACES WHERE WHEN YOU SIT LOW YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE THE CORNERS OF THE RINK  (fe_03_07607-A-0077)
SO UH  (fe_03_07607-A-0078)
I DON'T LIKE THAT EITHER AND IT'S HARDER IT IS HARDER TO FOLLOW THE GAME BECAUSE YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY ALWAYS SEE THE PUCK  (fe_03_07607-A-0079)
SO UM  (fe_03_07607-A-0080)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_07607-A-0082)
YEAH YEAH TO SEE THE PLAY DIFFERENTLY  (fe_03_07607-A-0083)
YEAH AND YOU SEE IT DIFFERENTLY AND YOU SEE HOW THE THE SCENE COMES TOGETHER DIFFERENTLY SO YEAH YEAH I AND EVERYONE YOU KNOW EVERYBODY WHO IS A SPORTS FAN HAS THEIR PLACE THEY LIKE TO SIT FOR THEIR PARTICULAR SPORT  (fe_03_07607-A-0084)
BUT UH  (fe_03_07607-A-0085)
