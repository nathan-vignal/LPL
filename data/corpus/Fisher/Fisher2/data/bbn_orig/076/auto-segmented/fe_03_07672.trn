SO THAT THAT ENDED MY MY CHICKEN  (fe_03_07672-A-0070)
RAISING  (fe_03_07672-A-0071)
BUT THEN I RECENTLY RETIRED AND I THOUGHT GEE I'D LOVE TO HAVE CHICKENS AGAIN AND SO SOMEBODY GAVE ME  (fe_03_07672-A-0072)
TWO HENS AND A ROOSTER AND TWELVE LITTLE BABIES  (fe_03_07672-A-0073)
AND THAT'S WHERE I STARTED  (fe_03_07672-A-0074)
SINCE THEN I'VE HAD MANY BABIES  (fe_03_07672-A-0075)
BECAUSE THESE HENS LOVE TO SIT ON EGGS  (fe_03_07672-A-0076)
UM  (fe_03_07672-A-0077)
RIGHT NOW UH I'VE JUST GOTTEN RID  (fe_03_07672-A-0078)
