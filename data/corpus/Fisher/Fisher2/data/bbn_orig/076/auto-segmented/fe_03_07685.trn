NO SHOULD I BEGIN  (fe_03_07685-A-0008)
OKAY  (fe_03_07685-A-0009)
IN RELATIONSHIPS AND LIFE PARTNERS I THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE A COMMON OBJECTIVE AH NO RELATIONSHIP IS GOOD WITHOUT WITHOUT A COMMON OBJECTIVE IN OTHER WORDS I THINK ALL  (fe_03_07685-A-0010)
UH MATTERS OF ASSOCIATION IN RELATIONSHIPS SHOULD BE BUILT AROUND A PROJECT SO IF THERE'S NO PROJECT IN THE UH STRUCTURE OF A RELATIONSHIP THEN THERE'S BASICALLY NO RELA- RELATIONSHIP  (fe_03_07685-A-0011)
UH PROJECTS THAT ENHANCE THE NATURE OF WELLBEING  (fe_03_07685-A-0012)
GOOD FOR ALL SO IF THIS C- C- CHRISTIANITY DOES A GOOD PROJECT  (fe_03_07685-A-0013)
IF IT'S UM HOUSING THAT'S ANOTHER PROJECT IF IT'S ECONOMICAL BASE THAT'S ANOTHER PROJECT IF IT'S EDUCATIONAL BASED THAT'S ANOTHER PROJECT SOMETHING SHOULD BE GIVEN TO A RELATIONSHIP  (fe_03_07685-A-0014)
THAT EMBODIES THE NATURE OF SOMETHING GOOD FOR ALL  (fe_03_07685-A-0015)
HEY GOD YOU'RE BRIGHT  (fe_03_07685-A-0016)

WELL I MEAN THAT'S ANOTHER THAT'S THAT'S ANOTHER SITUATION I'M SAYING THAT'S THE EXCEPTION TO THE RULE IF YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH SOMEBODY OR SOMEBODY  (fe_03_07685-A-0022)
CATCHES YOUR EYE AND THEN LOVE ENSUED THEN LOVE WOULD CARRY YOU THROUGH WHATEVER THERE IS TO GO SO I CAN'T REALLY SPEAK ON THAT BECAUSE THAT'S NEVER OCCURRED TO ME NO I'LL TAKE THAT BACK  (fe_03_07685-A-0023)
I FELL IN LOVE WITH MY SECOND GRADE TEACHER BUT SEEMINGLY SHE DOESN'T DIDN'T UNDERSTAND  (fe_03_07685-A-0024)
WELL IF THAT'S THE CASE UH THAT'S THE CASE UH THEN THAT DOESN'T APPLY TO MY UNDERSTANDING THAT'S OUT OF MY REALM OF COMPREHENSION SO PERHAPS YOU SHOULD TALK  (fe_03_07685-A-0026)
[LIPSMACK] WELL I MEAN ACTUALLY I LOOK AT LIFE QUITE DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE I'M NOT A PERSON THAT LOOKS FOR COLLATERAL DAMAGE OR COLLATERAL WELLBEING I'M HERE TO DO SOMETHING IN LIFE THAT WOULD BENEFIT EVERYBODY ELSE AND THAT'S MY PURPOSE OF LIFE  (fe_03_07685-A-0027)
AND THAT'S MY ASSOCIATION WITH ANYBODY WHO HAS A SIMILAR PURPOSE TO GO FORWARD IN A WAY THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER WORLD SO THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE FOR ME AS FAR AS LOVE  (fe_03_07685-A-0028)
I DON'T CONSIDER IT TO BE A A FAIRY TALE I CONSIDER IT TO BE A REALITY FOR SOME PEOPLE BUT IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED TO ME OTHER THAN WH- OTHER THAN REASON I JUST MENTIONED WHICH WAS MY SECOND GRADE TEACHER  (fe_03_07685-A-0029)
WELL ACTUALLY THAT'S A GOOD POSSIBILITY BUT SEEMINGLY THAT'S REMOTE DUE TO THE FACT THAT I'M VERY INUNDATED AND AND RELENTLESS IN MY ACTIONS TOWARDS DOING  (fe_03_07685-A-0030)
AND MAKING A BETTER WORLD THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES THAT NEEDS TO BE SOLVED I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN SOLVE THEM OR I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY CAN WELL WE'LL MAKE A ATTEMPT THERE'S AIDS  (fe_03_07685-A-0031)
THERE'S EDUCATION THERE'S HOMELESSNESS THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER THINGS THAT ARE PLAGUING OUR SOCIETY AS WE LIVE AND THOSE ARE THE ISSUES THAT I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS WITH MY LIFE  (fe_03_07685-A-0032)
AS THE LORD JESUS CHRIST AND OTHERS HAVE DONE THE WISE MEN AND THE PROPHETS AND THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE THAT I SHOULD BE DOING AS WELL  (fe_03_07685-A-0033)
BEING MONASTIC MEANS WHAT  (fe_03_07685-A-0034)
OH NO I DON'T THINK I'M A MONK I THINK I'M A CHRISTIAN WITH COMMON SENSE A LITTLE LESS AND SOMETIMES A LITTLE MORE AND I THINK ALL OF THE WISE MEN AND PROPHETS WERE PEOPLE OF WI- OF COMMON SENSE AS WELL  (fe_03_07685-A-0035)

WELL A LIFE PARTNER DOES FIT INTO THAT AS I SAID TO YOU BEFORE IT'S A MATTER OF UH PROJECT UH I THINK PROJECTS ARE VERY VERY IMPORTANT IN RELATIONSHIPS  (fe_03_07685-A-0040)
AND I THINK IT MAKES MORE RELATIONSHIPS MEANINGFUL AND YOU'VE JUST SAID THAT GOAL SO I THINK YOU USED THAT TERM AND THAT'S THE POINT THAT I'M SPEAKING ABOUT  (fe_03_07685-A-0041)
WELL I DON'T NECESSARILY LOOK FOR ANYTHING MYSELF IT'S JUST THAT MY GOAL IS TO DESIRE IN SUCH A MATTER FOR THE WELLBEING OF ALL OTHERS AND IT'S SO IF IN CONVERSATION AND ASSOCIATION  (fe_03_07685-A-0042)
THOSE ARE MY UH PRIORITIES UH WELLBEING CONSIDERATION COMPASSION KINDNESS  (fe_03_07685-A-0043)
FOR THOSE THAT ARE LESS FORTUNATE AND THERE'S A LOT OF THIS IN THE WORLD AND THIS IS MY OBLIGATION I BELIEVE OTHERWISE I WOULDN'T BE IN THE POSITION THAT I AM  (fe_03_07685-A-0044)
I'VE STARTED ABOUT THREE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS AND THEY ALL HAVE THE COMMON INTEREST AND GOAL AS WELL I CAN DEFINITELY SEE YOU S- SEE YOU  (fe_03_07685-A-0045)
