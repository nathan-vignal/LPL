L:  Hi.
R:  Hello, my name --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] Hello, how are you doing?
L:  Hi, my name is Zelda.
R:  My name's Monique.
L:  Hi, Monique.
R:  How're you doing?
L:  I'm fine.  And you?
R:  Pretty good.
L:  Good.
R:  Okay, let's start the conversation [LAUGH] I guess.
L:  Okay.  Um, I would not do it.
R:  Me neither.  My best friend's not worth a mill- -- my best friend's --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- worth than a billion dollars.  Would not trade her for the whole world.
L:  Right.  I wouldn't, um, do you kid- -- esp- -- uh, today I mean, people look at money --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- money is everything.  It's, like, they think that money's going to resolve all their problems.  And a million dollars today is not a lot of money.  And I would -- and that's a betrayal to me. 
R:  Oh, yeah, definitely.  And it's like turning on, like, okay, like, say that you would --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- rather your friend die rather than, you know --
L:  Right.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  [MN] That's like, mm, I don't believe in that.
L:  No.
R:  If you --
L:  I think human beings are pr- -- um, [LIPSMACK] friendship, relat- relationships with people are a lot more important than money.
R:  Amen.  I think that, you know, a few -- if you are friends with that person you want to turn their backs, they -- they won't turn their back on you, same as you wouldn't turn their back on them.
L:  Then you weren't really --
R:  You bet --
L:  -- their best friend either.
R:  -- yeah, if -- if -- if you do turn your back on your best friend, then y- you don't deserve that person, you know.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  [several inaudible words] is not worth as much as the person's life or your -- 
L:  No.
R:  -- best friend for example.
L:  Mm.  I don't think --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- any money is worth anyone's life.  Uh, a human --
R:  Mm mm.
L:  -- a person's life is worth everything.
R:  Amen.
L:  Amen [LAUGH] is right.   [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, boy.  [SIGH] Let's see -- let's see
L:  I mean, i- there's not really much that we can debate on this because we really agreed on it, you know.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I mean, if we didn't agree, then it's like --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- oh, man, I could [inaudible] for hours but --
L:  Right.  But, um --
R:  But it -- no, we agree.  That's [several inaudible words] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I wouldn't -- put it this way, if I [NOISE] couldn't [inaudible] my best friend for the whole world if I had a choice; especially the friend.  And to me my best friend is like a part of my family, you know -- you know --
L:  Actually, my -- right -- right.  I was actually talking to my best friend on the phone when I got this call, [LAUGH] --
R:  Oops.
L:  -- so, I said I got to call you back.  And my -- and my best friend is actually a relative.
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  So, yeah, because we grew up as kids together and we were always best friends.  So ...
R:  Man, that's really cool.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, my -- my best friend, we met, like, at least six years ago and we've been -- we've been best friends since then.  I mean, we're, like, we could finish each other's sentences, you know, like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- oh, it's crazy.
L:  And with this best friend, I can confide in anything and I -- I and, um, I trust her in everything --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- right.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And there's nothing that I can't say to her.
R:  Amen.
L:  And, uh, and then what would happen, I mean, I would lose that for a million dollars.
R:  No.  It's not worth it.
L:  You know certain parts of the country -- you can't even get a house in California --
R:  Not in --
L:  -- for a million dollars.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  You live in California?
L:  No.  I live in Massachusetts  
R:  I'm in California.  So, I know --
L:  Oh, you are --
R:  -- I'm in 'Cisco.
L:  Where -- San Francisco?
R:  San Francisco is, like, where the houses are over two million dollars.
L:  Right, right, because --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I have been to San Francisco twice because my son lives in San Hose.  So, I know that real estate out there's really --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- expensive.  So -- it -- it's not -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- even though -- I wouldn't do it for anything.  Nothing.
R:  Neither.
L:  No.
R:  Man.  
L:  No.
R:  These -- some of these topics are hard to discuss, you know.
L:  Right, right.  They are hard to discuss because if we agree with them right away, uh, there's not much and we have to talk about this topic the whole time of the study.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, um --
R:  Ten minutes is a bit long.
L:  [LAUGH] It is long --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- when you -- when you get to the agreement.  If we were --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- debating on it, it wouldn't be long.  But --
R:  Ooh -- I'd be, like, okay, turn it -- okay, let 'em -- give me 'nother two hours of [several inaudible words] [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] We'd be like the politicians.
R:  Oh, no.  Let's not get started with politicians.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, um, there's really not --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- much, um, I can say.  But I wouldn't --
R:  [NOISE] [MN] 
L:  -- do it.
R:  Dee, dee, dee.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.
R:  [several inaudible words] 
L:  So, uh, I wonder --
R:  Blah de blah.  Hm.  Hello.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay, I thought I lost you.
L:  I thought I lost you for a minute too 'cause they were -- I heard something different, um --
R:  Hm.
L:  I don't know.  I don't know what else to say because --
R:  Me neither.  I'm stumped.  [LAUGH]
L:  So am I.  [LAUGH] 
R:  This is the second --
L:  We got to be --
R:  -- time that I got this call that I got stumped.
L:  Oh, no.  The first one that I got was actually --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- last week 'cause I just started.  And we talked through the whole thing.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Which was good.  But we agreed.  So, um, [LIPSMACK] oh, this is hard.  It's hard --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- to talk like this.
R:  [several inaudible words] 
L:  Hey, i- I don't know, um, some time we -- we can always get different people, but it'd be funny if we got the same -- if we got to talk more than once and we became friends.  [LAUGH] 
R:  That'd be cool [several inaudible words] 
L:  And we're talking about best friends; we become friends, you know.  But, um, friends are actually -- see there's another thing that we can say.  You can choose your friends and you can't choose your family, okay.
R:  Amen.
L:  Right.  And then, um, you have no control over your family but your friends you do.  So, there's a lot about, you know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- when people say, "Oh, it's their friends [inaudible]" --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- like, when the kids get involved in things and lot of times they blame --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it -- parents will blame it on the other kid.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So, it's, like, you know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you chose that friend.  You chose to do that.  No one, you know, twisted your arm, like we would say back then or, um, nobody was pulling your leg.  Nobody was forcing you, coercing you.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, you choose because -- and friends are something chosen.  And you -- when you get to know that person [LIPSMACK] really well, you can either choose that person as a +best -- best friend by the way they are, or you know it's not so then you don't stay with that person.  You can say --
R:  You know what --
L:  -- okay, I'll be just a friend to call in or -- or, um, what's the word I wanted to use?  Um, I -- go ahead.
R:  I can have an i- -- I have an idea about this thing.  I think you know what?  What we could do after the million dollars [several inaudible words] with your best friend, yeah, right.
L:  Right.  That's it.  Because if -- then you weren't really my best friend because you wanted the money and you don't want --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- anything to do with me.  What kind of a best friend is that?  That's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- not a best friend.  That's somebody that loves money.  And the love of money is the -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- is the root of all evil.  So ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, so much evil happens because people love money.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  That's, um, they think that money is going to solve --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- all their problems.  How many rich people are unhappy people?  You know.
R:  [several inaudible words] 
L:  Just -- just like those two twin brothers in California --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that had the rich parents.  They had everything and they killed their parents.  They weren't happy.
R:  Whoa.  That's nuts.  I didn't hear about that.
L:  Oh, that's been years already.  Um, I can't remember the last -- their last name but it was a, um, a Spanish, like, the Minen[?] -- Minez[?] -- Minnezess[?] brothers.  Well, you sound young.
R:  Oh, yeah, I am.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I might be old enough to be --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- your mother so, um, so that happened a while.   So it's -- it's -- money doesn't bring you happiness.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Ah, Friends, family --
R:  It's friendship that brings you --
L:  -- is everything -- right.  Right.  That's how I look at it.
R:  Okay, we agree on that too.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.  Let's get a debatable topic with, George Bush.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [several inaudible words] and that war thing I could be talking forever.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  Yeah, but we can't talk [LAUGH] about that.
R:  I know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  We have to talk about what they --
R:  What they say, yeah.
L:  -- want us to do today.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  [NOISE] Hm.
L:  And, uh, well, they're going to know when they hear this, um, recording that we both agreed, and there not much more that we can say really.
R:  Well, exactly.
L:  Right.  So, we're just going to have to wait for the ten minutes to be up.
R:  Yeah.  The little tone.  [MN] You have thirty seconds to say goodbye.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's right, it's early over there.  It's already eight o'clock here.  That's right. 
R:  Oh, yeah, huh.  I forgot about the little time thingy here.
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.  So ...
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Give me my best friend.
R:  [NOISE] Huh.
L:  That's what I say.
R:  Hey, that's cool.
L:  That's what I say.  Mhm.  Yep.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Always.  Always there when you need them.  In hard times --
R:  Oh, and good times.
L:  -- everything.  And good times, right.  Always.  Always there to comfort you when you need them.
R:  Tell me about it.
L:  And that -- as you get older, the longer you're together, the longer you know one another --
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  -- you know.
R:  [several inaudible words]  
L:  Yeah.  Yep.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Uh, you're breaking up on me there.
R:  I know I'm inside of a building that doesn't like cell phones.
L:  Ooh, that's why, um, I'm -- I'm losing ya --
