L:  Ooh.  That sounds like fun.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Not for me.  [NOISE] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  Well, uh, it's a really weird question.
R:  Yeah, it is.  Oh, my best friend, well.  [NOISE] Hm.  [NOISE] Never speak to my best friend; for me, no.  [NOISE] [SIGH] Oh, gosh.
L:  It depends on which best friend [LAUGH] for me.
R:  [MN]  
L:  But, uh, I would probably say no.
R:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] Don't know [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] 
L:  I mean, there's a lot you can do with a million dollars.  
R:  Yeah, but [several inaudible words] --  
L:  You give it away to different people, organizations.  You can buy -- you know you can pay off your mortgage.
R:  Right.
L:  Can pay off your student loan.  You can [SIGH] -- 
R:  But you'll never find another best friend.  [NOISE] Well, you -- 
L:  True.
R:  -- hey, look, I could buy a best friend, I mean [inaudible]. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Well, um -- 
R:  Oh, no.  That was tough [NOISE] because thinking that -- looking at the way things are now with the economy being so bad and stuff, I got four children.
L:  Oh, you do?  You have four kids, yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I'm a student.  That's why I picked this phone think up so ...
R:  Ok, okay.  [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] 
L:  You know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- It's only ten minutes so [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, um, I'd have to say, mm, oh, gosh.  [NOISE] I don't know, uh -- uh, it would be hard for me not to be not to be able to ever speak to my best friend again.
L:  Yeah, it would.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I would definitely say no.  I mean, I thought about it for a minute because I, um, I live so far away from my -- my really best friend so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I only speak to them every once in a while anyway.  So, at this point, it would be yes, you know, but tha- -- I don't know.
R:  Well, me and my best friend --
L:  Friends are friends, you know.
R:  Yeah.  And money cannot buy true friends
L:  That's true.
R:  But I'm wondering what would my best friend choose.  She -- would she --
L:  What would she do?  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Would she take the million dollars? 
L:  I know I definitely know my -- my two best friends would -- would say no.  They would not take --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the money so --
R:  [inaudible] [NOISE] --
L:  -- pretty sure.
R:  -- I wish I could say the same about my best friends.  I aint a hundred percent certain.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm totally sure with these two.
R:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] Oh, boy.  Well, if they were say, my mother in law or something, that would have been easy.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] But, oh, yeah, I think I'd pass up on the million dollars bad as I need it 'cause my best --
L:  Four kids.
R:  -- friend we talk several times a day and she tries to --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- come to the house about every day.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, she lives in town.  Where are you calling from?
R:  Dublin, Georgia.
L:  Georgia.  You definitely have a southern accent.  I've never been --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- to the south.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, really?   [NOISE] Uh, you probably wouldn't like it; it's so hot down here.
L:  Yeah.  I'm from Portland, Oregon and the weather is --
R:  Ooh.
L:  -- is very mild there.  And Philly is -- just gets way too -- it's, like, a way to hot now for me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Think eighty five percent humidity.  [MN] like, no. 
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
L: I have to -- I have to go away for the summer.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But someday I'll make it to the south and I'll see it.
R:  I see.  So, you're talking from Philadelphia?
L:  Yeah, Philadelphia.
R:  Oh, okay.  I've been to Carlisle, Pennsylvania.  
L:  I haven't been there.  At least I haven't been there much longer than five minutes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think I've been there driving through.  [NOISE] 
R:  I had to go -- let's see, I think it was about November, uh, me and my -- well, soon to be ex husband, went to pick his bother in law's wife and her children up.  And they moved down here so ...
L:  Oh.  From Carlisle.
R:  Yeah, Carlisle.  
L:  Huh.
R:  He was in the army.
L:  Carlisle is not that big.
R:  No, it's not. 
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  Yep, they lived on I think it's the army base.
L:  Mm.  Yeah, that would make sense.
R:  Yeah.  [inaudible] 
L:  'Cause out there -- it's out there Pennsylvania?
R:  Pretty small.  Um, I liked Pennsylvania.  It was pretty nice.
L:  It's a big state.  It's got a lot of really pretty parts.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Philadelphia, [LIPSMACK] I don't know.  Well, I like it but it's not one [LAUGH] of the prettiest parts of Pennsylvania.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [inaudible] I've never been to Philadelphia.  I've always wanted to go.
L:  It's a big city.  
R:  [NOISE] Mm.
L:  It's like the ghetto of New York is what people --
R:  Really?
L:  -- sometimes call it, yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  Like, people always talk about how we're always trying to be in New York.  I don't really think so.  I just think we're our own little Philadelphia.  [NOISE] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Like, uh, you say you've never been to Georgia, huh?
L:  No.  I've never been anywhere in the south.  As far as the -- the farther south I've ever been -- well, no, I've been in Tennessee.  I've been to the Great Smokey Mountains.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I didn't go to any towns or anything.  I just went to the mountains and was in the mountains.  And [LAUGH] I drove right back --
R:  Oh, okay. 
L:  -- to Ohio.  So --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and then I've been to Richmond, Virginia.
R:  Okay.
L:  Which some people don't count as the south.  But I don't know, I kinda do. 
R:  Mm, [MN] [inaudible] pretty much [several inaudible words] [LAUGH] 
L:  It -- no it is the south.  I mean it was the --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- capital of the confederacy during --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the war so.
R:  Now, we've gotten a new flag I heard.  I haven't seen one of 'em yet but ...
L:  Georgia?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Oh.
R:  There's been a battle over the flag.  A lot of people want to keep that old confederate flag and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they've changed it.  And some people are really not satisfied with it but, [NOISE] um, I don't know.  I haven't even seen what the thing looks like yet.
L:  Really?  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  It don't matter to me.  Whatever flag --
L:  It's just a flag.  Yeah.
R:  [several inaudible words] [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  People get so hung up about --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- little things like that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- which, I mean, I guess it kind of is important but I don't know [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, not to me it aint.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, no kidding.  Me neither.  Me neither.
R:  Oh.  I don't know.  You got to come to see a flag sometime.
L:  Yeah.  Hm.
R:  And White Water is pretty nice.  Don't wait till it gets --
L:  Wait to -- you said Dublin.
R:  Dublin.  I live about an hour and a half, uh, south of Atlanta.
L:  Okay.
R:  I live [NOISE] near the point Atlanta and Savannah. 
L:  Okay.  I hear Atlanta and Savannah are really great places.
R:  Yeah, they are.  I prefer Savannah 'cause we can to the beach but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Atlanta's pretty cool too.  Lot of night life and 'specially if you like to party, it -- be it and that's the best place for you.
L:  Huh.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I -- I, um, a lot of kids in Philly are moving to, uh, Atlanta.  All I know about Atlanta, Georgia, is that they have this institute called the South Face Institute --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they, um, [LIPSMACK] they do all this, like, um, they go into homes and, like, retrofit it for, uh, like, be more environmentally friendly and, like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they plant trees where there's supposed to be trees to cool the house in the summer and, like, warm --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it in the winter.  It's like energy conserving thing.
R:  Oh.
L:  And I guess it's a really like one of the leading organizations in that -- in that, um, field.  So --
R:  Well, that's pretty nice.
L:  -- yeah, 'cause it gets hot there.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, good.  Oh.
L:  You kinda have to get, you know with it.
R:  And, yeah.  You think the further south you get, the hotter it would be, but it's a little bit cooler in Florida than it is here to me.
L:  Really?  I've never been to F- -- I've never been anywhere down there.  I have not --
R:  You got to start traveling a bit. 
L:  Well, I've traveled a lot.  Like, I've been to Texas.  I guess -- that's not -- Texas is just Texas.  It's not --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the south.  But -- and I've been all over the south west, and I'm from Oregon.  And I've been all over, you know I've been to Europe and I've been all over the east --
R:  Ooh.  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and the mid west.  But --
R:  I want to go to Europe.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  My grandparents died in -- when I was in high school so my -- my dad took me.
R:  Ooh.  Mhm.
L:  It was fun.  
R:  Mm.
L:  So ...
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, I bet that would be interesting.
L:  Yeah.  And I'm probably going to study --
R:  [NOISE] 
L: -- abroad, um --
R:  Yeah.  That would be fun. 
L:  -- next year.  Yeah.
R:  I would like to go to the Bahamas or Jamaica or somewhere.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I need me a good vacation.
L:  Yeah.  With four kids.  So, one's two --
R:  [NOISE]

R:  They -- uh, well, my [NOISE] oldest is twelve, and I --
L:  Twelve!
R:  -- got eleven year old, six year old, and this thing here that popped up on me 'cause I wasn't supposed to be able to have any more children.  [LAUGH]
L:  And that was a surprise.  I was a surprise too.
R:  Really?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, boy.
L:  I was the reason my parents got married.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, well, my first daughter was the reason why I married --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- my first husband.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's usually how it goes.
R:  Surprise.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yep.

R:  Um, this is my second time.
L:  Oh, really.  This is, like, my third time.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.
L:  But, um -- um, usually I talk to people form the south.  It's really weird.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  Maybe 'cause of the time zones or something.
R:  Yeah, we stay up all night.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, yeah.  I mean, the m- -- the night time is the only time I'm home so ...
R:  Oh, okay.  [NOISE] Well, I went to class today from five to about ten.  There it goes again --
