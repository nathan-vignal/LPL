R:  Hello.
L:  H- hi, this is Debbie.
R:  Hi, this is Sylvia.
L:  Hi, Sylvia.
R:  [LAUGH] How are you?
L:  [LAUGH] I'm just trying to get over this question. 
R:  Oh, yeah. 
L:  [MN] [LAUGH] 
R:  Is this your first call?
L:  Uh, no.  It's my second call.  But they just seem to get mo- [LAUGH] more and more ridiculous.
R:  M- my first call was kinda normal.  Um --
L:  Oh, really?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  But --
L:  Um -- 
R:  -- would -- would -- so would you take the million dollars?
L:  Well, no.  My best friend, um, I don't know my instinct -- my initial instinct is to say no.  Uh, you know, however, I guess [LAUGH] if I had to think about it a while.  See, I could do so much with a million dollars.  Help so many people.  But [LIPSMACK] I don't know, it just doesn't -- it doesn't feel right to --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to take -- to have this string attached, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- first of all.
R:  Right.  You're -- yeah, I -- I'm right there with you.  Um, I wouldn't take it because first of all, I live in New York and a million dollars is not that much money.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] So do I.  
R:  It really isn't. 
L:  That's right.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You're right.
R:  I mean, after taxes, I mean, what can you get [LAUGH] really?
L:  That's true.  [NOISE] 
R:  But, um, it's -- it's not even like -- it's not even like, "Oh, I don't -- I, um, the only thing I can do is not speak to my best friend".  But if you think about it, there's a lot of +continuances with that.  I mean, I'm close with my best friend's family --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, and my best friend's like a big part of my life.  And she's also a big part of our circle of friends.
L:  Right.
R:  So, it would mean being just pretty much isolating myself from that whole, like, group.  It's not even just one person.
L:  No.  You're right.  There's, like, a real rippling effect.
R:  Right.  If -- if --
L:  And then if your -- if your husband or boyfriend knows her too, it would be -- it w- -- you know, what if they wanted to maintain a friendship and you couldn't because --
R:  Right.
L:  -- of this agreement.
R:  Exactly.  And what would people think of you?  They're going to say, "Oh, so you can't come to this party with us because you went and took the stupid million dollars".  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Exactly.  No, no, I think -- I think it's a really -- it's [NOISE] [PAUSE] I -- I don't know I guess there could be an argument made for taking it.
R:  Right.
L:  And I think based on just the amount.  [LIPSMACK] And like I said, the fact that you could do a lot with it.
R:  Right.
L:  Uh, depending on your, you know, situation.  And it's interesting question though.  It -- it says you don't have -- you're not allowed to speak to them anymore but could you possibly give them money?  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Buy [inaudible] 
L:  Well, if you made an agreement with that person?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I could never -- I'll never speak to you again but I'll give you half a million dollars.
R:  Right.  Yeah, that's funny.  I -- I don't know, I mean, for th- -- it -- it seems --
L:  What kind of a benefactor is that any way?
R:  -- I know I [inaudible] 
L:  I don't think it's a very good definition of a benefa- -- in fact I get really ticked off, um, [LIPSMACK] especially in New York, you see this all the time, where these benefactors are constantly having their names plastered all over museums, galleries, and plastered everywhere just 'cause they've given their money to certain --
R:  Right.
L: -- places.  Like, whatever happened to, like, you know, sort of anonymity and just a humble sort of, okay, here; you know, here's ten million dollars to rebuild this museum wing, but you don't have to name it after me.
R:  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  Um, and the other thing that came to mind --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- was, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, with the new popularity of reality shows?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, like, pretty much people competing and just doing really stupid things or even mean and nasty things to each other just for, like --
L:  Just for money.
R:  -- and it's not even that much money sometimes.  Sometimes it's like forty thousand dollars.  I mean, it's money --
L:  Well, on heat --
R:  -- but it's not that much money.
L:  No.  You're right.  But I think on TV the factor is the same, right.
R:  Or all --
L:  Everybody wants to be on TV.
R:  It's the fame.  But also -- 
L:  It's pathetic.
R:  -- it's almost like trying to see the limits you can push.  Like how, like, can you get people to take off their clothes, or y- -- c- can you get people to eat disgusting food.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Um, to d- -- it's like -- like, what's someone's price, pretty much.
L:  Right.  [NOISE] 
R:  And I think it's almost like people --
L:  Where -- where's the limit?
R:  -- prostituting themselves.  It's really, like, just grotesque.  I don't like it at all.
L:  No.  You're right.
R:  And for me to, um, take a million dollars to not talk to my best friend; it's the same as me, like, jumping out of an airplane for, like, [MN] a reality show.  It's just as stupid.
L:  No.  You're right.  I like the use of the word prostitution.  You're absolutely right.
R:  Yeah.  'Cause it's trying --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- to see what people's prices are and what they're --
L:  Don- --
R:  -- willing to do for money.
L:  Don't you think though that, [PAUSE] um, that they -- it's gotten a lot worse.  It's beco- -- that this phenomenon has become more acute over the last five years or so.  I mean, I think American society is generally very money oriented.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, [PAUSE] but it's -- I think it's -- it's reaching some kind of peak, you know, with all these reality shows as you said and I don't know [several inaudible words] 
R:  Yeah.  It's not even just the money.  I think it's the shock factor.
L:  Oh.
R:  Like -- like people I mean, people go on it I mean, that's one thing.  But then the people that watch it -- it's because they want to see if the people are going to do these things.  Are they really going to do these things?
L:  It's kind of juvenile, isn't it?
R:  It is.
L:  Isn't it kind of like being back in high school; ooh, is she going to do that?  And --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- would she swallow that snail?
R:  It is.  And the networks love it because it's easy for them.  They don't have to hire actors.  No one has to write a script.
L:  That's true.
R:  I mean, pretty much, they just turn on a camera and then they just think of a premise.  And then they just watch, like, the money roll in.
L:  You're right.  In fact I think I heard there's a big --
R:  It's, like, the cheapest thing for them.
L:  -- backlash in Hollywood isn't there?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Quite a lot of actors, like, a little upset because they --
R:  There's no actors, no writers, no script.  It's -- it's like --
L:  Are there no writers either?  There must be writers, no?
R:  Um, well, not to write your actual lines.  
L:  No.  Right.
R:  Just to kind of write, like, the premise.
L:  No dialog, but the ideas, yeah.
R:  Yeah, that --
L:  There's an idea person
R:  Well, yeah.  It --
L:  Yeah.  I'm totally with you.  I totally agree and, um, [LIPSMACK] I think it's disgusting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I think it's, like I said, I think it's a reflection of just how shallow and petty American society has become, or is --
R:  Right.
L:  -- becoming or whatever.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  And ju- --
L:  -- so --
R:  -- just to get back to the topic --
L:  Yes.  Sorry --
R:  Um, oh, [inaudible] another reason why I wouldn't take a million dollars is, it's almost like, um, someone's controlling you and I don't like that feeling of, like, not -- like not be able to do what I want to do, or talk to who I want to talk, or  be with who I want to be with.  Because of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- these contingencies.
L:  Creating your own destiny.
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.
L:  Of course, who's to say that you never, I mean, [MN] if it's -- [MN] it's like a gentleman's agreement, isn't it?  I mean, who's to say that you couldn't take the money, agree to it, and then go talk to your friend.  I mean, [PAUSE] do you know what I mean?
R:  Right.  Right.  I guess.  I guess.
L:  There's that.  But, um, [PAUSE] [LIPSMACK] I don't know, I think it's, uh, yeah, it's like you said, it's kinda like a shock.  Maybe it's a shock question.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  This is -- this is like -- this is totally different from the first question but, like, this is only my second call.  So ...
L:  This is also my second call.  The first one was about, um, like, relationships; and what you think is the best trait in someone.  That --
R:  Oh, that's kind of normal.  My -- my first call was about getting, like, getting, like, catching colds from people, like a common cold.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  It was just like a regular question.
L:  It wasn't about the SARS virus, was it?
R:  [LAUGH] No.  No.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Not that at all.
L:  [MN] huh.  Yeah, it was just, uh, well, I don't know.  This -- but they did mention when -- didn't they say it was a benefactor though?  Or some -- some -- 
R:  Yeah.  They said, uh, a- -- 
L:  -- sort of specific --
R:  -- but didn't they say it was an anonymous benefactor.  So, like, why would I even go into an agreement with some person I didn't even know?
L:  Or perhaps you know them, and they don't want to be known.  
R:  Well -- 
L:  Their anonymity is part of the whole process.  Perhaps they do know you.  I mean, I don't know. 
R:  Right.  But the thing is it's like, I would think that nobod- -- I would -- I wouldn't want anybody to know, like, if I went and did this.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I wouldn't want anybody to know I took money.  And I certainly --
L:  Right.
R:  -- wouldn't be flashing it around.  Like, I would -- I mean if --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I went and did this, I would have to, like, somehow manufacture, like, a reason as to why I'm not talking to this person again.  Just so that, like, it wouldn't be -- make a logical sense to other people.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, honestly I have to really think about who my best friend is though, in a sense.  I mean, I'm -- I'm married, so really my husband's my best friend --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so it would be -- I not -- I'm not close anymore with, like, my best friend, like, in high school or --
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- something like that and I don't, I mean, I have good friends that I could rely on if something happens to me I'd call them.  But [LIPSMACK] I don't have, you know, like, a girlfriend that I call every day or something like that.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I'd really have to kinda --
R:  Right.  So, it's a little 
L:  -- wrack --
R:  -- different for you.
L:  -- my brain, yeah, to think of somebody who I -- [SIGH] [LAUGH] who I would not have to talk to.  I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- oh [inaudible] --
R:  Yeah.  See I -- I'm single and my --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- best friend is, like, we grew up together --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I've known her, her whole life.  And we've known each other our whole lives and, um, and we can never, like, not be friends 'cause we know too much bad stuff about each other.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] And she's si- -- and she's single too so --
L:  I think that's funny.
R:  -- so we do, like, a lot of stuff together.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, we're each other's dates for, like, weddings and stuff and we go on --
L:  Oh, that's neat.
R:  -- vacation together.  So, she's a big part of my life and we speak every day.
L:  Now, see that's cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I had that in high school and, like through college --
R:  R- -- yeah, when you -- 
L:  -- and then --
R:  -- get married it's different.  Yeah.
L:  -- no I -- I moved away and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- lived for many years outside of the county.  Moved in other s- -- lived in other states so, um, you know, it -- there are people I can just pick up the phone and -- and, you know, we're right back to where we were. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that's very cool.  That's a great kind of friendship.  But, [LIPSMACK] uh, yeah, I know -- I know exactly what you're describing.  I don't really have that with, like, a girlfriend
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um, it would be difficult.
R:  Right.
L:  But still, I -- I -- I have to go with my initial instincts, which is to say no.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because -- simply because it's just too sh- -- it's
R:  It's too sketchy. 
L:  -- it's that whole concept's too --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- shallow.  It's -- it's -- it's too -- yeah.  But it's that whole concept of anything for money.  Like money is the answer to everything --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- you know.  And, yeah, I mean a million dollars would be brilliant.  I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- whate- -- even if after taxes.  But [NOISE] I don't think it's worth putting that kinda price on it.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, like --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I've -- I've always, I mean, you know, who doesn't -- who couldn't use more money?
L:  Right.  [NOISE] 
R:  But, I mean, who doesn't have bills?  But --
L:  Well, Ted Turner, maybe.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  But I've -- I've always felt like, you know what, if I can't afford it, or it's out of my league, and I've lived this far without it, I don't need it.
L:  Right.
R:  Like, I don't need, like the m- --
L:  Not at that cost.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If you were to win it outright, like a lottery --
