R:  Hello
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name is Dawn
L:  I'm Simona, nice to meet ya.
R:  It's a pleasure meeting you too.
L:  So, what would you do, if you're given a million dollars would you chose th- the money or your friend?
R:  My friend.
L:  Your friend?  That's a good decision.
R:  How about you?
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] it's kinda a tough one.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm a military brat so --
R:  So, am I.
L:  -- uh, friends come and go.  And I moved so much in my life that I never really had one true, good friend.  I -- a- -- although I have -- I do have one true good friend, that's it.
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, and I -- I would have to say I'd take her over the money.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Although the money would sound really great.
R:  It would be really nice.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I could do a whole lot with that money.
R:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH] 
L:  So ...
R:  That's a tough one though.
L:  Yeah.  It -- it -- I mean, I guess I would have no doubtedly right away have said, "Oh, my friend", if I would have -- [MN] being in the military, you just [PAUSE] uh, you move -- 
R:  Don't have -- we just -- 
L:  -- you have so mu- -- you move so much that you don't even -- you forget really what the meaning of friends mean.  [NOISE] 
R:  Mhm.  'Cause you have acquaintances 'cause you're gone -- you're there and gone.
L:  Yeah.  By the time they actually become a friend, one of yous have already moved.  [NOISE] 
R:  Exactly.
L:  So, that situation, that would have been uh, if you had asked me, like, five, six years ago, I would have said, "The money".  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  So --
R:  But the money would come in handy now though too.
L:  Yeah.  But I could do a whole lot with that money r- -- especially right now in my life.  Not even a -- I mean, it wouldn't even have to be a million bucks.  You could just give me, like, ten grand and I'd be content.
R:  Oh, I'd -- I'd have to go a little bit more than that.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I want a house.
L:  Oh, yeah.  That would be really nice right now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I could do a lot -- lot of clothes, a lot of s- -- cruises.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, that would be nice.
L:  Trips.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well, we live in a teeny, teeny place so ...
L:  Oh.  Yeah, I probably -- I live in a trailer on an air force base.
R:  Okay, we live in a trailer in Pennsylvania.
L:  [LAUGH] So, we have something in common and they suck.
R:  Yes, they do.
L:  Especially -- i- it -- it's either too hot or too cold.  There's no medium.  [LAUGH] 
R:  No.  And sometimes the front stays nice and cool, and the back is burning hot.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  That's the way it is here.
L:  So, it would be nice to -- to -- to have that money.  And to, I don't know, [SIGH] buy something else -- buy something that I actually enjoy living in, rather [LAUGH] than dread going home to.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  A nice big house.
L:  Yeah.
R:  A nice play area for the kids.
L:  Oh, yeah.  See, I don't have any kids, but I have a dog.
R:  Oh, see I have --
L:  And he's --
R:  -- four kids.
L:  -- he's in dire need of a nice, like, little area to run around.  [COUGH] 
R:  See, it would benefit the dog then.
L:  The money would.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  This is a hard topic to talk about for ten minutes.
R:  I know.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Have you been doing this stuff for a long time?
L:  I've done it once before.
R:  Oh, have you?
L:  You?
R:  I've -- this is my second time too.
L:  Yeah.  This is my second time.  But I haven't any -- I haven't gotten payment for the first time.
R:  Me neither.
L:  Hm.  Oh, well --
R:  Some lady I -- the first lady I spoke to, she said that that was her third time [NOISE] on a call and she was [NOISE] --
L:  Had she gotten --
R:  -- well, she was waiting for her checks.
L:  Oh.  
R:  So, I couldn't tell ya.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Haven t spoke to her since so ...
L:  [LAUGH] So, [LIPSMACK] but either way, I don't know, how long have you known your -- your -- your -- your one [inaudible] two good friends?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Let's see, I'm thirty three -- I've known her about [PAUSE] say a good portion of my life -- almost twenty five years.
L:  Wow!  That's a really good friend.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Um --
R:  Couldn't give up the friendship.
L:  No.  I -- see I met my girlfriend when I was, uh, a freshman in high school.  And that had to have been about nine years ago.  So, I've known here for about a -- 'bout nine, ten years now.  So --
R:  It's --  
L:  -- I --
R:  -- it's hard to give up a friendship though.  [inaudible] I -- I don't care if it's for money or not.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That -- that's true.
R:  I mean, your friends stay with you, the money don't.
L:  Yeah.  Eventually you're going to run out of the money and then what do you have left?  [LAUGH]
R:  Nobody.
L:  And plus, even if you were given a money -- a big sum of money like that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- wouldn't you, [PAUSE] like, you would want to, like, help your friend out.
R:  Yeah.  Give them something so that they can have the --
L:  Buy them a house right next to your house so --
R:  Oh, that would -- 
L:  -- you guys are together all the time.
R:  Now that would be nice.
L:  So, if you h- -- if you actually took the money, the only friends you'd have are friends that would want you for your money.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, now I guess it all comes into play.
R:  Yeah.  But then you'd have to give up your best friend though.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  And you'll never -- you'll always -- you know, like, you'll always be that girl who talks about, "I remember my friend so and so.  We used to do this, this and that.  She was really a great friend but I dished[?] her out because I decided to take the money instead of being her friend".   [MN] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  So ...
R:  Then they think well, [MN] listen to her [MN] -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- she's too good.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I couldn't do that.
L:  Nah.
R:  No.  Not even if I needed it that bad.
L:  Yeah.  I'd have to pick the friend.
R:  Yeah.  [PAUSE] Money -- money's money.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's -- it's a want, not a need.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  'Cause --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- believe me, I know I want.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  I s- -- most certainly could want.  I could want a lot right now.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, I would.  I'd buy a new house.  I'd buy a car.
L:  Yeah.  I'd pay my truck off, pay my trailer off.  That way I wouldn't have no -- those are my only two bills.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, I just got rid of my truck payment.
L:  Oh.  I wish I did.  My truck payment's pretty high.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, ours was too.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's why we got rid of it as soon as we could.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Where are you anyway?
L:  I'm in -- out here in California in LA.
R:  Are you really?
L:  Yeah.  Well, I'm actually in Edwards Air Force Base.  It's about an hour north of LA.
R:  I used to live in Orange County.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  MCAS El Toro.
L:  What's that?
R:  MCAS El Toro.
L:  Oh.  So, it -- so where are you -- your husband's marine?
R:  Yeah.  He was, yeah.
L:  All right.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  When she said El Toro, I said, "Uh, it's got to be marine".
R:  Yep.  [LAUGH] We're out now.  We're in Pennsylvania.
L:   Oh, wow!
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's cool.
R:  So, it's your husband, right?  That's in the air force.
L:  No.  Me.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, you're in the air force?
L:  Yeah.  I'm in the air force.  My, um, I'm -- I'm recently divorced.  I was married to a -- an air force member as well.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, we s- -- we split and [inaudible] still stuck in the same base.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Ooh.
L:  I thought he was my good friend.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, I've been with my husband ten years.
L:  Wow!  It would have been -- it would have been four years of marriage for me [inaudible] yesterday.  Mm.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  Yeah.  It would have been four years.  We were together for about eight.  So --
R:  [MN] that's a long time.
L:  Yeah.  But when the cookie turns -- 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  -- bad [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- got to throw it away and get new ones.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Exactly.  That's when you know [LAUGH] it's out the door, you got to find something else.
L:  Yeah.  So, I don't know, I gu- -- I guess, like, I guess that through -- like, the whole military in me comes out, especially dealing with, like, the friends issue.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, I've moved so much in my life that I couldn't even -- I couldn't even, like, I'm -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm that type of person who I can just say, "You know you did me wrong by [inaudible]", like, friends come and go.  And I guess that's that military in me 'cause I never -- my dad was, like -- my dad was in the army.
R:  Is he?
L:  That's the only lifestyle I know is military.  So, friends --
R:  You've all been marines?
L:  -- friends come and go but you do find that one really good one.
R:  Yeah.  And that's the one you want to hang on to.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause you know they'll be there for the rest of your life.
L:  Yeah.  Those are the ones you keep up with.  So ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think we have, like four more minutes.
R:  Do we?
L:  [LAUGH] I'm a clock watcher.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Ah, okay.
L:  [LAUGH] I don't -- like, I don't know if you get credit if you don't, like, if you get off of the subject, you know.
R:  The lady that I spoke to --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- has never talked a full subject.
L:  Really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh.
R:  Said she hasn't -- 'cause you can't talk a whole, full ten minutes on a subject she says.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I -- I don't know.  Like I said, I've never been paid yet.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I couldn't tell you.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've heard good things about it though.
L:  Have you?
R:  Yeah.  That's the only reason why I'm staying.
L:  Yeah.  This is my -- I -- like, I went on vacation last week and I had, like, uh, six messages from them.
R:  Yeah.  I -- that's what -- we was out of -- well, we wasn't out of town, but we was down in the -- another part of Pennsylvania --
