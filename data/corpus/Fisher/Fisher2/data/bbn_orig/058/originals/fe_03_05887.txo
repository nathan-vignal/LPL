R:  Hi, my name is Beth.
L:  Hi, this is Trish.
R:  Hey, Trish.  Boy, that's a tough one. 
L:  I know. [LAUGH]  I had to stop and think.  First of all --
R:  Me too.  It took my breath away. 
L:  Yeah.  Well, it is a hypothetical.  Um, you know, I don't have one best friend, so that would be kind of tough. 
R:  Yes, me too. 
L:  Oh, 'cause I can't even figure out who it would be that I would have to be without. 
R:  With --
L:  Um --
R:  -- me, it's my best frie- -- my best friend's my brother. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- well.
R:  So I might as well be asked to take -- cut my arm off.
L:  Right. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, you know, [SIGH] my best friend is my husband.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Outside of --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- outside from him, um, I've got a couple of other girlfriends who I'm very, very close with, um, and I would say that one is probably closer than the others.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, [SIGH] a million dollars and not being able to talk to her again ever. [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  You know, that, you know --
R:  To me --
L:  -- in a --
R:  -- friendship is --
L:  -- perfect world I would like to say --
R:  -- more important than money.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I'm strapped.  I'm on disability.  I'm on Medicaid, you know, I'm on welfare and, you know, to me, y- -- I'm not materialistic 'cause to be without a friend, to be friendless -- and I meet a lot of 'em 'cause I'm a human rights civic activist, I do a lot of volunteer work.
L:  Okay.
R:  They're the most miserable people in the world.
L:  Yeah.  Well, there are [LIPSMACK] a lot of things you could do for a lot of people if you had a million dollars. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but I would tend to agree with you in, you know, I hope that in practicum my answer would be the same, [LAUGH] you know.
R:  Mm.
L:  I doubt that anyone's ever going to offer me a million dollars, but I would like to think that in reality --
R:  Right.
L:  -- my answer would be the same.  Um, but I would miss her so much, you know, because that's my one confidante --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- really, I, you know, um, the person -- we've been -- we've been close for a long time, but she can tell me anything and it just saves, like, it's in a safe, you know --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and the same thing for me and if I didn't have that -- those, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's my person to scream to.  Um, and then have a lot of fun with, you know.  And I just don't know what I would do without her.  Um, you know, if the Lord took her away that would be one thing --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but to say, "I'm going to choose to be comfortable financially over my friendship with you", mm.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, I just -- I can't see --
R:  I know --
L:  -- that.
R:  -- a lot of very lonely, ah, rich people. 
L:  Yeah, yeah, really.  And you probably spend up all that money just trying to be happy.
R:  You got that right. 
L:  And never accomplish it.
R:  You sound like you know the Lord.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I do, that's my rock. 
R:  Mhm, me too. 
L:  Well, good. 
R:  My -- my brother's mentally challenged.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Now, if the question was would I be willing to pay a million dollars for him to be mentally normal, yes. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, so that he'd have a normal I.Q. and he'd have a job and a wife.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yes. [LAUGH] 
L:  Does he stay with you?
R:  That'd be easy [LAUGH] if I had a million dollars to pay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I -- I do have a right arm to give. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Does he stay with you?
R:  Ah, my parents and I check on him every day.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  He lives quote unquote independently.  
L:  Okay.
R:  But it's not -- my pa- -- my mother owns a condo.  I'm with him six days out of seven.
L:  Wow.
R:  Ah, and I get one or two days off and I'm physically with him twenty four seven, three to four days out of every week.   And I -- I'm on the telephone with my mother every day.  And my mother's on the telephone with me.  And we just keep, ah -- I take him to the Y two, three days a week.
L:  Mm.
R:  I take him to volun- -- he volunteers at the hospital one day a week.  He goes to support group for mentally --
L:  That's good.
R:  -- challenged one day a week.  Um, trying to get a support group for family members and siblings, adult siblings and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- for parents of, ah, mentally challenged.  I can't get it going.  Ah, I have friends -- friends with some wonderful people who have mentally challenged siblings and, um, children, adult children, and it's, ah, you -- your life's not your own, [LAUGH] let me put it that way. 
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  I- -- it's --
L:  -- could imagine.
R:  -- I'll tell you, it tests the sinc- -- the sincerity of my dates, right real quick. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because all I have to do is, ah, I make it clear right from the first day -- I'm forty five, he's forty seven -- "Well, I have a mentally challenged brother [LAUGH] and he's in my life forever, can you accept that?" [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, really, well, it is what it is.
R:  Most guys disappear right real [LAUGH] quick. 
L:  Oh, that's unfortunate.
R:  And, ah, ah, I -- he will be with me for the rest of my life.  I -- we have a floating guardianship.  My mother's got guardianship, but, you know, when she's put of town, I have a piece of paper that gives me complete guardianship of him.  And when she passes I'll have guardianship and that's our biggest beef with my mom.  I mean, we go in circles on this.  I feel like she's trying to pin bro- -- both my arms behind my back [LAUGH] and make me eat spinach.  Ah, you know, she wants me to take guardianship with -- of him now, while she's still alive, so there won't be a quarrel and -- 'cause we wanna keep him out of a group home.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And I probably will take it.  I'll be with him for the rest of my life and she wanted me to go to New York city -- we're from New York City, Brooklyn, New York -- and she wanted me to stay with him a month and s- see if I could stand [LAUGH] having that guardianship for a month and -- and, ah, being responsible for a month.  He -- but it's difficult -- he can be very difficult.  He's very rigid.  And he can -- he can throw temper tantrums.  I have to be on top of him constantly.
L:  You have to do what?
R:  You have to be on top of him -- or anyone else that's mentally challenged --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- constantly.
L:  Mhm, just stay with him.  
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  But that's the one you're saying is your best friend. 
R:  Yes, he is. 
L:  See, I couldn't --
R:  Probably 'cause when I share something with him, I know it doesn't go anywhere, except when he rats me out to mom and dad. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] No, but --
L:  But you have such a bond.
R:  -- I work hard.  I'm trying to get a little small circle of friends for both him and I, and it's hard -- it's hard, 'cause I need to find someone that -- that is there for me, ah, intellectually and then there's someone there for him.
L:  Right, right. 
R:  But w- -- I love him very much.  And I -- certainly no million dollars -- and I certainly wouldn't put him into a group home for a million dollars.  And it's funny, 'cause he plays, ah, the lottery, one dollar once a week -- he doesn't know the difference between a dollar bill and a twenty dollar bill or a hundred dollar bill for that matter. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, but he'll guard a million dollars without taking a penny of it. [LAUGH] It helps when you don't know the value of the --
L:  Right.
R:  -- million dollars. 
L:  Right. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Or if he knows he's got it.
R:  Excellent security guard.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] But unfortunately he'd give it away to the first person --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- that walked up to him. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I'm sorry --
L:  Well, that's where the guardianship takes --
R:  -- if I don't laugh I cry.
L:  Yeah, that's where the --
R:  I love him.
L:  That's where the guardianship comes into play.
R:  Well, he gives me --
L:  But all that you get --
R:  -- a lot of joy.
L:  -- from that, you know.  Gee, a million dollars could not replace that.  All you could do is buy a house and a couple of cars and, you know, do some things for some family and friends and by the time --
R:  I'm absolutely non materialistic.
L:  Yeah, and that wouldn't last you -- you know, when you just start going crazy, I bet it wouldn't last you a good five years. 
R:  [MN]
L:  And then --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- you're without.  
R:  Now, if that question was --
L:  And you're still without your best friend.
R:  -- take off you- your right arm, your right eye, your right leg, to make him normal, darn right I would, in a heart beat.
L:  Yeah.  That's more --
R:  Give a kidney away, make him normal. [LAUGH] 
L:  If it's more what you would do for your best friend --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- than what you would take to be without your best friend. 
R:  Yeah, it -- it -- it -- he is priceless.  [LIPSMACK] You know, 'cause he's a spirit -- you know, he's a wonderful spirit. 
L:  And the Lord put you with him for a reason. 
R:  Yes, I feel that very strongly and my mother's very -- what I call is very spiritually advanced. [MN] We're all Christians, we're all devout Christians.
L:  Mm. [PAUSE] And that's just the spirit that he needs.  That's wonderful. 
R:  Yeah, he's a blessing to us and -- and I think God chose a very good family for him.
L:  It sounds like it.  Because a lot of people would choose to do something different.  And have -- have chosen to do something different.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Where they're not so encumbered personally, you know.
R:  Exactly.
L:  So, I honor your decision and your commitment.
R:  Thank you. [PAUSE] And I -- I respect you too.  'Cause friendship is so precious.  There'd be a lot of people in this world, if they had a million dollars would pay it to have a close confidante friend.
L:  But, you know -- oh, that's right, that's right, but I'm thinking, you know, if you would take a million dollars to do away with your best friend, that [MN] you really weren't much of a friend.
R:  You got that right. 
L:  Mm, you did not have any idea of the value of a true friendship. [PAUSE] 'Cause I hear some people say, you know, they go through a whole life and -- and don't really have anyone they could call a really, really good friend, or a best friend.  And that's, um, that's kinda sad to me.
R:  It is.  I would love to know what the answers are to that question among the other people.
L:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  I bet a lot of them would be like the way you and I are.  I really do.  I --
