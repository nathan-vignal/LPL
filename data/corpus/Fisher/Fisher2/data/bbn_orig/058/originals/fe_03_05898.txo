R:  Hi, my name is Kate.
L:  Hi, my name is Lorie.
R:  How's it going [LAUGH]?
L:  Good [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.  So, we're supposed to talk about if someone gave us a million dollars --
L:  Yeah, that's a hard one --
R:  -- but we can't --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  I know.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I haven't ah done one of these yet because I -- everytime I just didn't feel like doing it [MN] --
L:  Oh, you know what, I haven't either, so we're both new at this [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, okay cool [LAUGH].  Well, ah, yeah, I don't know.  I guess like I mean when I first heard the first part, when they said it was a benefactor like just straight up benefactor I was like, "That sounds cool" because I've always wanted an anon- -- anonymous benefactor.
L:  Yeah, no kidding [LAUGH].
R:  But um --
L:  I could use it right now.
R:  Right.  Me too.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So, I don't know.  A million dollars would be nice, but never talk to your best friend sounds a little bit extreme.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think I probably have to think really long and hard about that [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.  [LAUGH]
L:  Now, I think I would talk to my best friend regardless [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  I know --
L:  I would be the type to say, "Okay, I can't handle it" [LAUGH].
R:  And you'd take the money and s- -- and you'd kind of like sneak talk to your friend?
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.  Exactly.
R:  Send them code messages.
L:  Well, you know, I wouldn't talk to her, maybe I could get around it by emailing her [LAUGH].
R:  Right [LAUGH].  There you go.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't -- I don't live in the same ah area with her anyway, so I email her most of the time anyway [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, me too.  Same thing.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's cool.  Um --
L:  Well, maybe we can learn sign language [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, right [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  They'd have to be very specific about that.
L:  That's right.  That's right.  They'd have to say no contact whatsoever.
R:  Exactly.  Um, but I don't know.  I mean, I mean it depends.  Like, if you could -- if you could take the money and you could buy -- really do -- if you could be sure that you would do great things with it or something, you know what I mean?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Or even like you could sneak your friend some money or something [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  You could do that [LAUGH].
R:  I guess -- I guess maybe that might work [LAUGH].  But --
L:  Put their kids through college [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]  How many kids do you have?
L:  I have two.
R:  Oh, okay.  I don't have any kids, but --
L:  Yeah.  I have two little kids, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Thinking about colleges are a real burden [LAUGH].
R:  Uh-huh.  Seriously --
L:  Especially when you know you just go through college yourself and you think how much it cost and then you think you've got two more to provide for, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that takes a while.  What did you say your first name was again?
R:  Um, my name is Kate.
L:  Kate, okay.
R:  You were Lorie?
L:  Yes, Lorie.
R:  Yeah, I'm -- I'm actually ah -- I'm doing Americorp[?] so I don't have much money, I don't know if -- do you know what Americorp is?
L:  No, I don't.
R:  It's kind of like the peace corps, but it's in the United States.
L:  Oh.  Oh, that's neat.
R:  So -- yeah.
L:  That's neat.
R:  So --
L:  Yeah, so you could do a lot with that money [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.  [LAUGH]
L:  A lot of neat things with that money [LAUGH].
R:  Yep [LAUGH].  I could.  See what I mean, it would be cool, but on the other hand you also would have to pay taxes, wouldn't you?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I think you would.  I think you would.
R:  Probably.  Which --
L:  Yeah.  You definitely would.
R:  -- wouldn't be cool.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't think they're going to le- -- let you get away with that [LAUGH].
R:  Uh un.
L:  A luxury tax or, what is it, a gift tax --
R:  Yeah, probably.
L:  Charge you gift tax [MN].
R:  And that would probably be a pretty big chunk of change, though.
L:  Yeah.  A million doll- -- I mean, you know, a million dollars doesn't go far these days --
R:  It's true.  Yeah, I know.
L:  [LAUGH] So, you got to consider you know most people who win the lottery have it spent before you know their time's up, any way --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- you know and they -- they have it spent the -- the -- I heard somewhere that there was a um ah they -- they -- they have it spent within the first five years --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- most people who win the lottery have it spent within the first five years because they mis manage it, yeah.
R:  That is terrible [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  So, if you think about it, you know --
R:  All that money just floating around for no reason.
L:  Yeah.  And then you don't get to talk to your best friend for five years [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  Yeah, you know --
L:  I wonder if it's until you -- until you spend the dollar [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I don't know [LAUGH].  Don't know what the clauses are, but I think -- I mean I -- I have to say, like probably for -- for real if it was -- if it was forever I would talk to my friend I'd --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- say I'm not going to take the money.
L:  Yeah.  I wouldn't be -- I wouldn't be that type that let money mo- -- motivate my um I what I would call eternal progression [LAUGH].
R:  Right.
L:  I would -- I would definitely think that, you know, I'm going to take my friends with me but not my money and my things, so --
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.  It's very tempting to a lot of people, though, with the debt situation the way it is, so ...
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know, but I think I would um -- I don't know I -- I mean, the other thing is you could always get like you said a million dollars isn't even that much these days and you could always -- there's other ways to get it, you know, if you really r- --
L:  Sure.  Yeah.
R:  -- really wanted it [LAUGH].
L:  That's true.  That's very true.
R:  So --
L:  I have that same idea that I think, oh, there's plenty of ways to make money.  I -- I'm a stay at home mom, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, I'm always trying to think of different ways to bring in -- you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- money for myself or for my kids or for people and I know and, you know, I always like pass along the information.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But you know, I -- I guess als- -- also in a business, so I always think, "Oh, money's easy to come by, easy to spend" [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.  That's true.
L:  So --
R:  Yeah, it goes both ways [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  But, yeah, there are like there's just so many, I mean you know there's -- and there's also a lot of schemes, you know, but they don't really work, but --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- or -- but I think like I don't know, it's just, yeah, like you said, it's not -- it's not stuff that really matters in the end [LAUGH].
L:  That's true.  That's the way I feel.  You know, like you said, you know, the money when you're in dire straights, especially when you know you have bills and you have debt and you have things that need to be paid for and then you have other people depending on you, you know, the money starts tempting you for a moment and then you start --
R:  Right.
L:  -- thinking about it and you talk about it and if you had to mull it over, you'd probably say, "You know what, a million dollars isn't that much these days anyway, so" ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's not going to get, you know, and a lot of those people, they say you know they win the lottery, they spend it all in five years and then they get in debt after that because they're so used to spending it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so used to having money and you know, what's the point, you're going to die in debt --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  Yeah, and they overextend themselves and buy like huge houses and things like that --
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.  That's [inaudible] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's true.
R:  And I mean I guess like even like I mean I guess especially if you have kids, that's very tempting, but it also would be, you know, if your kids ever knew how you got the money --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they'd probably wonder what kind of person you were, you know what I mean, like --
L:  True.  That's true.  It's a --
R:  -- to take --
L:  -- judgment --
R:  -- I mean --
L:  -- of your character if you would give up a friend for money.
R:  Right.  So --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I don't know, I think ah and I guess -- and your friend might -- who knows what would happen, maybe your friend would turn against you [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, true.  True.
R:  And --
L:  You probably wouldn't have any friends at that point --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because if you can't be a friend you can't have a friend --
R:  [MN] Right.
L:  So, that's interesting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's -- that's a really interesting question.  I never thought that one would come up.
R:  Yeah.  I know I -- I like can't remember what some of the other ones were, that I -- that I've heard you know another one I got was hypothetical situation but I didn't even hear what the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what the thing was because I didn't even -- I just wasn't in the mood to talk to [several inaudible words].
L:  Well, they -- they come up with scenarios and you can turn 'em down.
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  I -- this is the first time I've ever even been called on it so --
R:  Oh, okay, yeah.  They called me a couple of times and I just you know they give you this recording, you know, do you want to accept this --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [inaudible] and I would just be like, "Oh, I'm not in the mood really" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because I'd be doing something [LAUGH].  But um, yeah, it's interesting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I don't know how -- it's so funny, I actually talked to my sister and she said she was doing this too and she said she wondered if [LAUGH] -- it's funny, because they're recording this -- but they -- she wondered if the topic is really whether people will stay on topic or not [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Because it's --
L:  That's true -- is -- is it --
R:  -- ten minutes --
L:  -- pertinent to -- yeah, ten minutes on one subject, I'm glad it something like that, though [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.  You can talk about money all day long [LAUGH].
R:  That's true [LAUGH].
L:  Now does your -- your sister does this and she um -- she's been doing it for a while?
R:  Yeah, she did a few of them, I guess, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, that's good.  Yeah.  I haven't -- I haven't told anybody about it because I didn't know if it really worked.  I thought it was --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- kind of interesting [LAUGH] found it over the Internet.
R:  I don't know about the -- I don't know about the money part [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  But ah --
L:  I was wondering if that happens, or if they just record you for nothing [LAUGH] just kidding.
R:  Right.
L:  I -- I'm sure --
R:  I'm --
L:  -- it's a legit.  It seemed pretty legit.  I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- usually check things out pretty thoroughly, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- anyway.
R:  But I guess, ah --
L:  And as far as the yeah, as far as the subject is concerned, I mean you pretty much an talk around it, but, you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, okay.  What would you do with the million dollars? [LAUGH]
R:  Um, if I actually took the money, I would probably -- I don't know.  I would -- I would try to like donate some to charity for sure.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Or maybe even like -- or maybe like try to start my own -- my own kind of non profit --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to do, you know, so I can get my future going and I can hire people and also to do you know [SIGH] good things but not -- but nowhere's going to, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- use it as like a jumpstart --
L:  Right.  Right.  See, I'd do that too.  I'd probably start a -- start a business that would keep me going and I would definitely help you know family members.  I have family members who are just in such severe debt and [LAUGH].
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know.  I would put it -- first put away, you know, I mean I always donate money to my church, so I'd donate money to my church and then I would, you know, I would -- I would you know pay my -- my tithing to my church and then I would take, you know, the next chunk of it and I would probably, you know, ah start some tor- -- type of business or --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- set aside money for my kids' college, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's really important.  So --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, I would definitely, definitely help out you know those in need --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I've got so many needy people in my family already that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it'd probably be gone pretty quick [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  It wouldn't take long.  But --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- you know probably rather than just paying off their debt, I would more likely start them out in a business so that it was an ongoing thing, you know because --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, having owned a business I know that it's something that can keep you going for life and you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- like, yeah, that teaching, give a man a fish you feed him for a day, teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime type --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- concept [LAUGH].
R:  Right.
L:  That's the way I'd look at it.  I would think --
R:  What kind of -- what kind of business
