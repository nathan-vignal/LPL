NOT TOO BAD HOW ARE YOU TODAY  (fe_03_08437-B-0005)
YEAH WELL YOU KNOW IT'S SOMETHING TO DO RATHER THAN SIT THERE AND WANT TO SLAUGHTER THE PERSON IN FRONT OF YOU  (fe_03_08437-B-0006)
[LAUGHTER] OKAY  (fe_03_08437-B-0007)
SO OUR WONDERFUL TOPIC TODAY IS WHAT CHANGES IF ANY HAVE YOU MADE IN YOUR LIFE SINCE SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH  (fe_03_08437-B-0008)
UM  (fe_03_08437-B-0009)
WELL I CAN START I REALLY HAVEN'T MADE ANY BECAUSE I'VE LIVED OUTSIDE I'VE LIVED ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF AN AIR FORCE BASE ALMOST MY ENTIRE LIFE SO I'VE ALWAYS BEEN MODERATELY PARANOID [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08437-B-0010)
I'M FROM A FAMILY OF PILOTS SO YOU KNOW I I DON'T EVEN THINK TWICE ABOUT GETTING ON A PLANE HOWEVER SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH I PANICKED BECAUSE I WAS AT WORK  (fe_03_08437-B-0011)
AND I KNEW THREE OF MY FAMILY MEMBERS WERE DUE TO FLY A PLANE THAT DAY  (fe_03_08437-B-0012)
AND OR BE ON ONE AT LEAST YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08437-B-0013)
SO THAT WAS KIND OF TERRIFYING 'CAUSE I WAS NOT SURE IF AH AND WELL MY STEP BROTHER WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ON THE FLIGHT OUT OF BOSTON THAT CRASHED  (fe_03_08437-B-0014)
AND HE HAD TRADED WITH SOME OTHER GUY THAT DAY  (fe_03_08437-B-0015)
AND LUCKED OUT  (fe_03_08437-B-0016)
OTHERWISE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ON THAT ONE FLIGHT SO  (fe_03_08437-B-0017)
YEAH IT WAS  (fe_03_08437-B-0018)
BUT IT STILL DOESN'T CHANGE HOW I FEEL ABOUT BEING ON A PLANE YOU'RE STILL MORE LIKELY TO HAVE SOMETHING BAD HAPPEN TO YOU IN A CAR NOT THAT I WANNA SAY THAT WHILE YOU'RE IN A CAR BUT [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08437-B-0019)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08437-B-0020)
WELL IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT FAR MORE PEOPLE WERE INJURED EITHER IN THEIR CARS OR IN THEIR WORKPLACE  (fe_03_08437-B-0021)
[LAUGHTER] THAT DAY THAN ACTUALLY ON AIRPLANES  (fe_03_08437-B-0022)
SO YOU KNOW AH STATISTICALLY SPEAKING YOU'RE NOT AT ANY MORE RISK THAT WAY  (fe_03_08437-B-0023)
HOWEVER I AM GLAD THEY FINALLY HAVE DECIDED TO ARM THE PILOTS 'CAUSE MY  (fe_03_08437-B-0024)
MY FAMILY MEMBER'S THAT ARE PILOTS THEY ALL PRETTY MUCH  (fe_03_08437-B-0025)
HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING ARMING THE PILOTS IN SOME WAY SHAPE OR FORM FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS  (fe_03_08437-B-0026)
RIGHT BECAUSE YOU KNOW IF THERE'S YOU KNOW IF IT'S A HOSTAGE SITUATION  (fe_03_08437-B-0027)
IF THE PILOT HAD A WAY TO LOCK THE DOOR PROPERLY AND THEN TURN AROUND WITH A WEAPON  (fe_03_08437-B-0028)
THEN THERE WOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM  (fe_03_08437-B-0029)
BUT  (fe_03_08437-B-0030)
YEAH WHEN YOU COME FROM A FAMILY OF PILOTS IT CHANGES YOUR PERSPECTIVE A LITTLE BIT TOO  (fe_03_08437-B-0031)
YEAH MY STEP DAD IS A PILOT AND MY STEP BROTHER AND HIS WIFE  (fe_03_08437-B-0032)

WELL ACTUALLY IF YOU USE DUCT TAPE THE PROPER WAY IN COMBINATION WITH PLASTIC YOU CAN CREATE AN AIRTIGHT SEAL AROUND YOUR DOORS AND WINDOWS  (fe_03_08437-B-0040)
THEORETICALLY SPEAKING HOWEVER  (fe_03_08437-B-0041)
