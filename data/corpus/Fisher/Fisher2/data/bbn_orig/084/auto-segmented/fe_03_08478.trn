HUH  (fe_03_08478-B-0026)
[NOISE] RIGHT  (fe_03_08478-B-0028)
I THINK STUDIES HAVE SHOWN I MEAN THIS ISN'T REALLY RELEVANT SO I GUESS I SHOULD GET OFF IT BUT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE LOWER ONE'S INCOME IS THE MORE [MN] OF THEIR INCOME THEY'RE LIKELY TO DONATE TO CHARITY THAT THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE THE LEAST ARE THE PEOPLE WHO DONATE THE MOST  (fe_03_08478-B-0029)
REALLY  (fe_03_08478-B-0030)
PROBABLY 'CAUSE THEY'RE THE PEOPLE WHO MOST KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE WITHOUT AND I GUESS THESE ATHLETES THAT MAKE ALL THIS MONEY JUST HAVE NO CONCEPT OF WHAT IT IS TO BE LIKE ON STRIKE LEGITIMATELY LIKE TO BE A NURSE WHO'S FORCED TO WORK YOU KNOW UM  (fe_03_08478-B-0031)
EIGHTY HOURS A WEEK OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW HOW HOW SOME NURSES IN SOME HOSPITALS ARE JUST  (fe_03_08478-B-0032)
TOLD THEY HAVE TO STAY  (fe_03_08478-B-0033)
OVERTIME AND THE SAME THING HAPPENS EVEN WITH DOCTORS LIKE IT AND THEY CAN'T REALLY I MEAN SOMETIMES THEY DO GO ON STRIKE BUT THEY CAN'T REALLY BECAUSE IT'S LIKE PEOPLE DIE IF THEY GO ON STRIKE WHEREAS YOU KNOW THE WORST THING THAT HAPPENS IF AN ATHLETE GOES ON STRIKE IS OH SOMEONE DOESN'T GET TO SEE A GAME THEY WANNA SEE  (fe_03_08478-B-0034)
SO IT'S KIND OF IT'S NOT AS THEY'RE THEY'RE MORE AT LIBERTY TO LIKE OH NOT AT LIBERTY BUT IT'S MORE [LIPSMACK] YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN IT'S LESS OF A PRESSING MATTER IF THEY THEY GO ON STRIKE I DON'T  (fe_03_08478-B-0035)

THAT  (fe_03_08478-B-0037)
WITH WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS LIKE OKAY NASCAR YOU NEED TO BE TRAINED TO DO THAT YOU KNOW YOU SHOULDN'T JUST GO DOING THAT IN YOUR BACKYARD BUT LOTS OF GAMES  (fe_03_08478-B-0038)
I I I JUST I THINK THAT THAT TAKES AWAY FROM THE FUN OF IT MHM  (fe_03_08478-B-0039)
I THINK IT'S CRAZY BUT THE MORE SOME PEOPLE MAKE THE MORE THEIR SENSE OF ENTITLEMENT GROWS  (fe_03_08478-B-0040)
THEY THEY GET ALL THIS MONEY THEY WENT FROM BEING NOONE TO BEING A PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE AND THEY GOT ALL THIS MONEY AND THEN THEY JUST DECIDED THEY DESERVED EVEN MORE THAN THAT  (fe_03_08478-B-0042)
AND THEY'RE JUST UM  (fe_03_08478-B-0043)
OH I MEAN WHO DOES THE WHERE DOES ALL THE MONEY IF IF IF SOMEONE GOES ON STRIKE BECAUSE THEY THINK THEY SHOULD GET PAID MORE WHERE DOES THIS EXTRA MONEY COME FROM I MEAN ARE THEY JUST CHARGING FANS MORE FOR GAMES  (fe_03_08478-B-0044)
OR  (fe_03_08478-B-0045)
I DON'T KNOW IF I WERE A FAN WHICH I'M REALLY NOT BUT IF I WERE I WOULD YOU KNOW THAT WOULD BE THE KIND OF THING THAT WOULD DISCOURAGE ME FROM GOING I MEAN 'CAUSE IT'S [MN] YOU KNOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE ENJOYABLE IT'S A FORM OF ENTERTAINMENT YOU KNOW IT'S  (fe_03_08478-B-0047)
[MN] SOMETHING YOU WOULD DO TO GET YOUR MIND OFF ALL YOUR TROUBLES AND THEN  (fe_03_08478-B-0048)
YOU KNOW IT'S IF THEY'RE HAVING THEIR OWN SOAP OPERA  (fe_03_08478-B-0049)
THEN IT'S YOU KNOW YOU HAVE ENOUGH TROUBLE IN YOUR OWN LIFE AND YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO HAVE YOU KNOW YOUR YOUR MEANS OF ENTERTAINMENT UM DISRUPTED BECAUSE  (fe_03_08478-B-0050)
I DON'T KNOW IT'S IT'S ALMOST LIKE THEY TAKE THEMSELVES TOO SERIOUSLY  (fe_03_08478-B-0051)
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'RE BRAIN SURGEONS OR OR OR YOU KNOW NUCLEAR PHYSICISTS OR WHATEVER THEY'RE  (fe_03_08478-B-0052)
PLAYING A GAME  (fe_03_08478-B-0053)
THEY'RE PRETTY EASILY REPLACED IN MY MIND YOU KNOW LIKE THERE ARE LOTS OF EXCELLENT BALL PLAYERS AND ONLY A FEW OF THEM GET  (fe_03_08478-B-0054)
GET PICKED TO BE IN THESE IN THESE TEAMS AND  (fe_03_08478-B-0056)
[SIGH] I DON'T KNOW I WOULD THINK THE THREAT OF BEING REPLACED SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO MAKE THEM NOT WANNA ROCK THE BOAT TOO MUCH BUT  (fe_03_08478-B-0057)
MHM  (fe_03_08478-B-0058)
YEAH  (fe_03_08478-B-0059)
THINK PART OF IT IS THAT THE THEY'RE ONLY USEFUL FOR A VERY SMALL PART OF THEIR LIVES YOU KNOW LIKE THAT I MEAN YOU KNOW IN THIS IN THIS VENUE THEY CAN ONLY BE A PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE FOR YOU KNOW WHAT TEN YEARS OR SOMETHING  (fe_03_08478-B-0061)
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE LIMIT IS BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING LIKE IT'S NOT LIKE A LIFE LONG THING SO MAYBE THEY FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE THIS SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME IN WHICH THEY HAVE TO YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08478-B-0062)
LIKE SQUEEZE THE MOST OUT OF IT AS POSSIBLE I I MEAN I DON'T I CAN'T SAY I REALLY UNDERSTAND WHERE THEY'RE COMING FROM BUT  (fe_03_08478-B-0063)
I GUESS IT'S POSSIBLE  (fe_03_08478-B-0064)
