HI I'M JASON  (fe_03_08474-A-0001)
HI LANA  (fe_03_08474-A-0002)
YES AND THE STRIKES BY PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES AS WELL  (fe_03_08474-A-0003)
YEAH THE STRIKES AND THEIR HIGH SALARIES BECAUSE I GATHER THERE ARE SEVERAL ATHLETES NOW THAT ARE THREATENING TO GO ON STRIKE  (fe_03_08474-A-0004)
UM MONEY BENEFITS OR THEY DON'T LIKE THE COACHES THEY'RE WORKING WITH  (fe_03_08474-A-0005)
I SUPPOSE SO [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08474-A-0006)
I MEAN I GUESS MY ATTITUDE ABOUT ATHLETES THAT EARN THAT MUCH MONEY IS IF YOU WANT TO TREAT THEM AS ENTERTAINERS THEN I SUPPOSE THEY COULD GET THAT KIND OF SALARY BUT IF YOU TREAT SPORTS AS IF IT'S SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT SOMETHING IT'S ALMOST LIKE OBSCENE TO  (fe_03_08474-A-0007)
ME SO  (fe_03_08474-A-0008)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_08474-A-0009)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08474-A-0010)
YEAH I I DON'T KNOW THE FULL DETAILS ABOUT THE STRIKES I KNOW IN THE PAST THEY'VE HAD THEM BECAUSE THEY FELT THAT THE LEAGUES  (fe_03_08474-A-0011)
WHICH KIND OF CONTROLLED THE TEAMS YOU KNOW WHEN THEY HAVE THE LIKE THE BASEBALL LEAGUES WHEN THEY I THINK THEY HAD THE BASEBALL STRIKE SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND THEY CLAIMED THAT THE LEAGUES WERE PROVIDING TOO MANY LIMITATIONS ON  (fe_03_08474-A-0012)
WHERE THEY COULD SEARCH FOR NEW TEAMS TO PLAY ON AND AND YOU KNOW THEY THEY WANTED TO BE ABLE TO BE MORE FREE AGENTS THAN  (fe_03_08474-A-0013)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08474-A-0014)
WHICH IS TRUE THEY ARE KIND OF JUST BOUGHT AND SOLD LIKE I DON'T KNOW UM LIKE CATTLE BUT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND WELL IT'S ALWAYS THIS THIS  (fe_03_08474-A-0015)
PARADOX BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND THEY PAY HUGE SALARIES TO PEOPLE WHO THEY THINK WILL BE STARS BUT THEN THE WHOLE PREMISE OF MOST OF THESE SPORTS IS THEY'RE TEAM SPORTS AND I WOULD THINK THAT IT WOULD BE  (fe_03_08474-A-0016)
FITTING IF THEY WERE ALSO REWARDED FOR BEING A GOOD TEAM PLAYER AND I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY ALWAYS LOOK AT IT THAT WAY  (fe_03_08474-A-0017)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_08474-A-0018)
YEAH AND I'VE NEVER QUITE FIGURED OUT I MEAN THE TEAMS TO TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE VALUABLE AND THEREFORE THEY'RE WILLING TO PAY THAT AMOUNT FOR A PLAYER HOW DO THEY DETERMINE THE PROFITABILITY OF IT BECAUSE  (fe_03_08474-A-0019)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_08474-A-0020)
I ACTUALLY DON'T I DON'T FOLLOW THEM THAT CLOSELY I MEAN THE ONLY SPORT I'LL WATCH PERIODICALLY IS BASEBALL BUT BASKETBALL AND FOOTBALL I GUESS IN THE WINTER I'VE I'VE NEVER BEEN THAT INTERESTED IN SITTING AT HOME AND WATCHING  (fe_03_08474-A-0022)
WELL I USED TO JOKE WITH MY FRIENDS THE ONLY THING I EVER KNEW ABOUT FOOTBALL WAS THAT IT ALWAYS MADE SIXTY MINUTES COME ON LATER AND I'D TURN ON THE T._V. AND THE CLOCK WOULD SAY THREE MINUTES REMAINING IN THE GAME  (fe_03_08474-A-0023)
EXACTLY SOMEHOW WITH ALL THE TIME OUTS THEY THEY IT WOULD IT WOULD STRETCH OUT TO THIRTY FORTY MINUTES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT  (fe_03_08474-A-0024)
AND I GUESS BUT THAT'S PROBABLY PART OF THE REASON WHY YOU KNOW THAT THAT THE PLAYERS FEEL THEY CAN DEMAND SO MUCH MONEY TOO IS BECAUSE OF THE T._V. RIGHTS YOU KNOW IF THEY ARE BECOMING LIKE ENTERTAINMENT STARS THEN THEY FEEL THEY CAN DEMAND WHAT HOLLYWOOD STARS GET  (fe_03_08474-A-0025)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08474-A-0026)
I GUESS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS I HAVE WITH THAT THOUGH IS IT SORT OF MAKES PEOPLE THINK MORE OF SPORTS IN TERMS OF THE MONEY AS OPPOSED TO THE WHOLE PREMISE OF TEAMS AND STUFF  (fe_03_08474-A-0027)
OH EXACTLY  (fe_03_08474-A-0028)
AND THEY BECOME VERY DEMANDING AND IT STARTS  (fe_03_08474-A-0029)
YEAH YEAH AND I MEAN YOU KNOW SORT OF IF MAYBE IF THE NAIVE IDEALISM OF OF WANTING TO SAY OH BUT WE GO TO SEE IT BECAUSE IT'S  (fe_03_08474-A-0030)
PEOPLE SHOWING HOW YOU CAN WORK AS A TEAM AND AND THAT SORT OF STUFF WHEN IN REALITY IT'S ALMOST LIKE LIKE FOR SHOW MHM  (fe_03_08474-A-0031)
RIGHT BUT ALSO PART OF THAT THAT'S PART OF WHAT BOTHERS ME IS THAT THEN YOU KNOW IF KIDS ARE LOOKING AT THEM AS AS ROLE MODELS THEY'RE NO LONGER JUST SEEING THEM AS ROLE MODELS BECAUSE THEY PLAY WELL BUT THEY'RE SAYING OH WHEN I GROW UP I WANNA EARN THAT KIND OF MONEY TOO  (fe_03_08474-A-0032)
RIGHT WELL IT'S SORT OF FUNNY BECAUSE I FIND UM THEY ACTUALLY STARTED A A MINOR LEAGUE TEAM I LIVE IN NEW YORK AND THEY THEY HAVE A A MINOR LEAGUE TEAM THEY STARTED IN BROOKLYN A FEW YEARS AGO AND I'VE HEARD THOSE GAMES ARE SO MUCH MORE FUN TO GO TO THAN THE YANKEES AND THE METS  (fe_03_08474-A-0033)
BECAUSE THERE'S ALMOST MORE OF A SPIRIT TO IT UM YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08474-A-0034)
RIGHT SO I ALMOST SEE THEM AS KIND OF LIKE LIKE INDEPENDENT MOVIES I TEND TO ENJOY MORE THAN THE BIG HOLLYWOOD THINGS BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL FORMULA ANYWAY AND IT'S LIKE BEFORE THEY GET CORRUPTED BY THE THE THE BIG  (fe_03_08474-A-0035)
BIG DOLLARS YOU KNOW IT'S ALMOST THEY THEY'RE TAKING THE GAME MORE SERIOUSLY UM AS OPPOSED TO OH I'VE GOTTA LOOK GOOD FOR THE AUDIENCE OR YOU KNOW LOOK LIKE I'M EARNING MY SALARY  (fe_03_08474-A-0036)
SO I DON'T KNOW I I I SUPPOSE IF I WERE MORE INVOLVED IN THE GAMES I'D APPRECIATE MORE THE INDIVIDUAL PLAYERS BUT YOU KNOW WHEN I HEAR THAT THEY'RE GOING ON STRIKE I THINK WELL YOU KNOW THEY'VE JUST FOUND ANOTHER ANGLE TO TO WORK OUT SOME MORE MONEY  (fe_03_08474-A-0037)
OH YEAH WELL THAT'S ALWAYS AMAZING  (fe_03_08474-A-0039)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08474-A-0040)
IT'LL AMAZE ME TOO THOUGH SOMETIMES THEY'LL GET RECRUITED RIGHT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL OR COLLEGE INTO THE THE PROFESSIONAL UM LEAGUES  (fe_03_08474-A-0041)
AND WELL IT HAPPENS ONCE IN A GREAT WHILE BUT THEN I'M THINKING JEEZE YOU'RE GOING TO LET THIS PERSON SACRIFICE YOU KNOW ANY FUTURE POTENTIAL THEY COULD HAVE IN ANOTHER CAREER  (fe_03_08474-A-0042)
YEAH THEY CAN GET THE MONEY NOW UM AND THAT  (fe_03_08474-A-0043)
YEP  (fe_03_08474-A-0044)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08474-A-0045)
WELL THAT'S ONE OF THE AREAS I KNOW THAT LIKE A LOT OF FACULTY GET REALLY ANGRY BECAUSE THEY SEE ALL THE MONEY THAT THEIR COLLEGE HAS SPENT ON ON UM  (fe_03_08474-A-0046)
COACHES AND TEAMS I AT INDIANA I REMEMBER WHEN BOBBY KNIGHT WAS THERE THEY WOULD THE THE FACULTY WERE FURIOUS BECAUSE THEY THEY FELT THAT THE THE UNIVERSITY WHEN THEY'D BE CUTTING BACK IN A CLASSROOM  (fe_03_08474-A-0047)
OH YEAH THEN THEY SAID WELL BUT YOU KNOW THIS IS HOW WE RAISE FUNDS FOR THE COLLEGE BECAUSE IT RAISES OUR PROFILE AND IT'S LIKE WELL SHOULDN'T A COLLEGE BE MORE ABOUT  (fe_03_08474-A-0048)

YEAH WELL  (fe_03_08474-A-0051)
NO THEY'RE THEY'RE LIVING COMFORTABLY  (fe_03_08474-A-0052)
AND AND I MEAN I GUESS THAT'S ONE MORE WAY WE SORT OF TRY TO MAKE THEM CELEBRITIES IS WELL LOOK HERE'S SOMEONE WHO MADE A LOT OF MONEY  (fe_03_08474-A-0053)
BUT I GUESS I DON'T KNOW IF THAT THAT DESERVES TO BRING RESPECT OR NOT BUT UM IT DEFINITELY SEEMS TO BRING THEM A LOT OF ATTENTION  (fe_03_08474-A-0054)
YEP  (fe_03_08474-A-0055)
WELL AND IT'S INTERESTING THERE'S ONLY A VERY FEW OF THEM ACTUALLY EVEN KNOW HOW TO SAVE THE MONEY THEY EARNED LIKE ALL THIS MONEY THAT'S GOING AT THEM A LOT OF THEM JUST SEEM TO SPEND IT YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08474-A-0056)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08474-A-0057)
YEAH  (fe_03_08474-A-0058)
WELL THAT SEEMS TO BE THE BIG THING ABOUT THESE HIGH SALARIES IS THERE'S SO MANY MIDDLE MIDDLE MEN IT'S LIKE THEIR AGENT HA- AND MUST GET A PERCENTAGE OF IT AND OTHER PEOPLE WHO HANDLE THEIR MONEY MUST GET A PERCENTAGE OF IT SO IT'S JUST EVERYONE'S GOT THEIR HAND OUT YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08474-A-0059)
WELL ALL THEY KNOW IS THEY'RE THEY'RE GETTING ATTENTION SO MHM  (fe_03_08474-A-0060)
THAT'S TRUE THAT YEAH THAT'S A GOOD POINT BECAUSE I I SUPPOSE  (fe_03_08474-A-0061)
I MEAN ALL ANYONE ANYONE WILL TELL THEM WHILE THEY'RE PLAYING IS WELL YOU KNOW YOU HELP US WIN AND THAT'S A GOOD THING AND THAT'S ALL YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT  (fe_03_08474-A-0062)
THAT'S EXACTLY IT OR YOU EYE ON THE PRIZE OR HOWEVER THEY SAY IT YEAH SO  (fe_03_08474-A-0063)

[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08474-B-0007)
IT DOES SEEM OBSCENE BUT I GUESS IT'S JUST AH  (fe_03_08474-B-0009)
AH WHATEVER THE MARKET WILL BEAR AND IT'S COMPETITION AMONG THE OWNERS OF THE TEAMS TO BUY THE BEST ONES AND THEY KEEP BIDDING THEM UP HIGHER AND HIGHER  (fe_03_08474-B-0010)
WHICH AH IS THE WAY THE MARKET WORKS  (fe_03_08474-B-0011)
BUT AH I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND THE LOGIC BEHIND THE STRIKE BUT THERE'S ALWAYS TWO SIDES TO EVERY STORY  (fe_03_08474-B-0012)
THEY FELT WHAT  (fe_03_08474-B-0013)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_08474-B-0014)

AH IF THEY ENJOYED IT BEFORE THEY BECAME PROS IT BECOMES JUST A JOB AND THEY ARE UNDER EXTREME PRESSURE  (fe_03_08474-B-0036)
BUT THEN IT'S WORK AND NOT PLAY  (fe_03_08474-B-0037)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_08474-B-0038)
