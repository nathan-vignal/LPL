DO- OBVIOUSLY THEY GET SOME KIND OF MAJOR BONUSES FOR THAT IS THAT WHAT THEY'RE HOPING FOR IF THEY TAKE TAKE A PAY CUT THEN THEY'LL MAKE IT UP IN THE BONUSES OR  (fe_03_08486-A-0088)
WELL WHAT WOULD THEY BE DOING IT FOR  (fe_03_08486-A-0089)
BESIDES JUST HAVING A TROPHY AND A CHAMPIONSHIP RING ON YOUR FINGER  (fe_03_08486-A-0090)
THAT'S INCENTIVE ENOUGH  (fe_03_08486-A-0091)
HI MY NAME IS REUBEN  (fe_03_08486-B-0001)
HI LINDA HOW ARE YOU  (fe_03_08486-B-0002)
YEAH ATHLETES AND THE STRIKES DO YOU THINK THEY DESERVE AH THE MONEY  (fe_03_08486-B-0003)
WELL IT SAID RECENT STRIKES  (fe_03_08486-B-0004)
RIGHT CORRECT  (fe_03_08486-B-0005)
I AM I AM A BIG SPORTS FAN  (fe_03_08486-B-0006)
I THINK IN MY OPINION IT'S AH MOSTLY THE FAULT OF THE OWNERS I THINK IF THEY CAN HOLD DOWN AND STRIKE BECAUSE THEY THINK THEY'LL GET MORE THAN AH  (fe_03_08486-B-0007)
THEN THAT'S THEIR RIGHT WHETHER THEY'RE RIGHT OR WRONG WHO WHO'S TO SAY  (fe_03_08486-B-0008)
UM  (fe_03_08486-B-0009)
YEAH I MEAN IF THE OWNERS GET TOGETHER AND CAP IT THEN THAT WOULD BE A VIABLE OPTION TOO AGAIN WHETHER THAT'S GOOD OR BAD IS AH  (fe_03_08486-B-0010)
UM  (fe_03_08486-B-0011)
YEAH THAT THAT THAT'S A GOOD POINT BUT AH  (fe_03_08486-B-0012)
AGAIN THE MANAGERS HAVE TO MANAGE OKAY YOU GIVE MICHAEL FIFTY TIMES MORE BUT YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO BUILD THE TEAM NOW ARE YOU WILLING TO PAY MICHAEL FIFTY TIMES MORE BECAUSE HE'S THAT MUCH BETTER  (fe_03_08486-B-0013)
PAY THE REST OF THE TEAM EXACTLY  (fe_03_08486-B-0015)
SO I MEAN TAKE ALEX RODRIGUEZ FOR EXAMPLE IN TEXAS THE OWNER GAME HIM A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR CONTRACT AND NOW HE REGRETS BECAUSE HE PUT ALL HIS EGGS IN ONE BASKET HE REALIZES HE'S NOT GOING TO WIN A CHAMPIONSHIP WITH ONE GREAT PLAYER  (fe_03_08486-B-0016)
HE CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY ANY GOOD PLAYERS SO  (fe_03_08486-B-0017)
EXACTLY AND THEY BOUGHT A COUPLE OF PHILADELPHIA GUYS BECAUSE I'M UP HERE IN PHILLY SO  (fe_03_08486-B-0019)
THEY BOUGHT A CHAMPIONSHIP AND I DON'T THINK BASEBALL HAS A SALARY CAP SO THEY CAN GO OUT AND SPEND WHATEVER THEY WANT AND BUY THE  (fe_03_08486-B-0020)
CHAMPIONSHIP  (fe_03_08486-B-0021)
AND AND THE OWNER CAN'T GO CRY- CRYING POOR BECAUSE HE'S THE ONE WHO PAID ALL THOSE GUYS HE WANTED THE CHAMPIONSHIP HE HE PAID ALL THAT MONEY AND NOW UM  (fe_03_08486-B-0022)
EXACTLY SO AND IF AND IF YOU CAN HOLD OUT AND I MEAN ANY NORMAL PERSON NOT JUST ATHLETES BUT IF YOU CAN UM HOLD OUT TO GET A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY WHY SHOULDN'T YOU YOU SHOULD GO FOR THE MOST YOU CAN OR THE BEST DO THE BEST YOU CAN  (fe_03_08486-B-0023)
SO  (fe_03_08486-B-0024)
EXACTLY THAT WAS GOING TO BE MY NEXT POINT IF THEY'RE NOT MAKING MONEY THEY'RE NOT IN IT TO LOSE MONEY SO THEY GOTTA BE MAKING MONEY TO STICK WITH IT AND THEY ALSO GOT TO BE MAKING IT TO BE PAYING IT OUT BECAUSE NOBODY'S IN IT TO LOSE MONEY  (fe_03_08486-B-0026)
SURE  (fe_03_08486-B-0027)
SURE AND ANY NORMAL PERSON WHEN THEY GO FOR A JOB INTERVIEW YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE  (fe_03_08486-B-0028)
MOST YOU THINK YOU DESERVE OR THE MOST YOU CAN GET SO IF AN ATHLETE THINKS HE CAN GET MORE BY STRIKING THEY GET TOGETHER AND BETTER BENEFITS THEN AH  (fe_03_08486-B-0029)
YOU KNOW THAT'S THEIR RIGHT THEY HAVE IN IN THIS SOCIETY BUT THE OWNERS THEY ALSO HAVE THE RIGHT TO GET TOGETHER AND SAY WE'RE GOING TO CAP IT SO AH  (fe_03_08486-B-0030)
YEAH BUT AH  (fe_03_08486-B-0031)
EXACTLY IT'S AN EGO THING LIKE YOU SAID WITH MICHAEL JORDAN GETTING AH FIFTY MILLION HE THINKS I'M THE BEST SO AH I SHOULD AH GET MORE THAN EVERYBODY ELSE  (fe_03_08486-B-0032)
WELL IN MY OPINION MICHAEL JORDAN UM WANTED WANTED A NEW WELL HE WANTED A NEW CHALLENGE TOO AND AND AND LET'S FACE IT HE WAS A BIG PART OF WHY THEY WON THE CHAMPIONSHIP BUT UM  (fe_03_08486-B-0034)
THERE WAS OTHER PEOPLE INVOLVED TOO THERE WAS SCOTTY PIPPIN THERE WAS THE COACH NOW AH COACH PHIL JACKSON IS IN LOS ANGELES AND HE'S WON THREE CHAMPIONSHIPS THERE SO THERE WAS A LOT OF OTHER INGREDIENTS THAT WENT INTO THAT CHAMPIONSHIP ALTHOUGH MICHAEL JORDAN WAS THE FOCAL POINT BUT AH  (fe_03_08486-B-0035)
WELL HE ALSO IS AH TEN YEARS OLDER THAN HE WAS SO YOU KNOW TO SAY HE'S NOT THE SAME PLAYER TO SAY HE'S NOT THE BE- BEST AH SAME PLAYER THAT'S DEFINITELY TRUE BECAUSE AH HE'S ALSO TEN YEARS OLDER BUT UM YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08486-B-0036)
BUT YOU KNOW YOUR EGO GETS THE BETTER PART OF YOU BECAUSE YOU FEEL YOU CAN DO IT AND YOU WANT TO PROVE YOU CAN DO IT AND BOXERS HAVE THAT AH THAT THAT THAT PROBLEM  (fe_03_08486-B-0037)
THEY'RE OVER THEY'RE OVER THE HILL AND AH THEY STILL THINK THEY CAN COMPETE IT'S AN EGO THING MICHAEL JORDAN STILL THINKS HE CAN COMPETE AT A HIGH LEVEL BUT AH DEFINITELY WE ALL KNOW NOT DEFINITELY NOT THE LEVEL HE USED TO SO  (fe_03_08486-B-0038)
YEAH YEAH THAT'S TRUE  (fe_03_08486-B-0039)
BUT AH  (fe_03_08486-B-0040)
YOU KNOW THE STRIKES THE  (fe_03_08486-B-0041)
I MEAN THE REAL LOSERS WITH THE STRIKES ARE THE FANS AH WHEN THEY HAD THE BASEBALL STRIKE I BELIEVE IT WAS BACK IN NINETY THREE I HAD STOPPED GOING TO BASEBALL GAMES AND SAID I WOULDN'T SUPPORT IT BUT AH  (fe_03_08486-B-0042)
I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS NINETY THREE EXACTLY WHEN THE BASEBALL STRIKE WAS BUT THEN YOUR TEAM STARTS DOING WELL AND YOU DO GET INTERESTED AND AND AND YEAH AND THEY'RE GOOD FOR THE CITY YOU KNOW BECAUSE THE CITY HAS A GOOD AH A FEEL FOR AH  (fe_03_08486-B-0043)
FOR THEMSELVES BECAUSE YOUR TEAM'S DOING WELL AND YOU TAKE PRIDE IN THAT BUT UM  (fe_03_08486-B-0044)
OH THAT'S A BIG FOOTBALL STATE YES  (fe_03_08486-B-0045)
YEAH YEAH BIG HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL I MEAN FROM HIGH SCHOOL ALL THE WAY UP TO THE PROS AND I I'M PHILADELPHIA SO YOU KNOW THE RIVALRY WE'VE HAD WITH THE  (fe_03_08486-B-0046)
COWBOYS AND THE AH  (fe_03_08486-B-0047)
AND THE EAGLES BACK IN THE LATE SEVENTIES AND EARLY EIGHTIES  (fe_03_08486-B-0048)
BUT AH AND THE AH FOOTBALL STRIKE WAS INTERESTING TOO BECAUSE BACK WHEN THEY HAD THE FOOTBALL STRIKE UM THEY ACTUALLY HIRED WHAT EVERYBODY CALLED SCAB PLAYERS  (fe_03_08486-B-0049)
AND THEY AH THEY PLAYED AND THAT WAS A BIG THING HERE IN PHILADELPHIA BECAUSE PHILADELPHIA'S A BIG UNION TOWN SO THEY WOULD SUPPORT THE AH THE N._F._L. PLAYERS AND PICKET WITH THEM  (fe_03_08486-B-0050)
AND PICKET THE GAMES AND THERE WERE SOME FIGHTS AND EVERYTHING BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE PAYING TO GO IN AND SEE THE SCABS AND AH PEOPLE WERE UPSET WITH THAT BUT UM  (fe_03_08486-B-0051)
YEAH YEAH YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO FEEL SORRY FOR A GUY WHO PAYS  (fe_03_08486-B-0052)
WHO'S GETTING PAID FIVE MILLION OR FOR A GUY WHO'S SITTING OUT BECAUSE HE WANTS SIX MILLION BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS HE WOULDN'T DO IT UNLESS HE KNEW THE OWNERS WOULD PAY IT SO THEY THEY DOWNGRADE  (fe_03_08486-B-0053)
YOU KNOW THEY BATTLE WITH EACH OTHER THEY HAVE EGOS TOO THESE OWNERS AND AH ESPECIALLY LIKE THE GUY WITH THE DALLAS MAVERICKS HE HAS YOU KNOW HE'S PAYING TRYING TO GET A CHAMPIONSHIP AND AH  (fe_03_08486-B-0054)
YEAH SOME OWNERS THAT ARE THAT HAVE MADE THEMSELVES RICH OUTSIDE OF SPORTS AND THEN THEY AH  (fe_03_08486-B-0055)
TRY TO BUY THEMSELVES A CHAMPIONSHIP LIKE THEY DID IN FLORIDA YOU KNOW WAYNE JOSEANGA I BELIEVE IT WAS THAT AH WON THE CHAMPIONSHIP DOWN THERE  (fe_03_08486-B-0056)
SO I MEAN THESE GUYS ARE PAYING IT SO THE ATHLETES STRIKE BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY CAN DO IT AND THEY KNOW THEY'LL GET THE MONEY EVENTUALLY  (fe_03_08486-B-0057)
WELL MICHAEL JORDAN HE USED TO MAKE EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR PLAYING BASKETBALL FORTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR WITH ENDORSEMENTS  (fe_03_08486-B-0058)
BUT UM  (fe_03_08486-B-0059)

HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION  (fe_03_08486-B-0061)
YEAH  (fe_03_08486-B-0062)
UM I THINK IT'S ABOUT AH LESS THAN TEN YEARS MAYBE EIGHT YEARS YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08486-B-0063)
SO HE'S GETTING HE'S GETTING QUITE A BIT OF CHANGE BUT THE GUY CAME OUT AND SAID HE REGRETS IT BECAUSE HE SPENT ALL THIS MONEY ON ONE ATHLETE NOW AND HE CAN'T AFFORD TO BUILD THE TEAM AROUND THEM SO UM  (fe_03_08486-B-0064)
AND I THINK JORDAN ACTUALLY  (fe_03_08486-B-0065)
YOU KNOW TOOK A PAY CUT OR WHATEVER TO GET SOME PLAYERS IN TO HELP HIM WIN THOSE CHAMPIONSHIPS IN CHICAGO  (fe_03_08486-B-0066)
BECAUSE ONE GUY GETTING ALL THE MONEY WASN'T GOING TO GET IT DONE SO WHEN THEY BOUGHT IN SCOTTY PIPPIN AND SOME OF THE OTHER SUPPORT PLAYERS  (fe_03_08486-B-0067)
AS A MATTER OF FACT A LOT OF THAT'S HAPPENING NOW CARL MALONE WAS JUST IN THE NEWS HE'S SIGNING FOR THE N._B._A. MINIMUM AND GARRY PAINTIN HAS SIGNED FOR THE N._B._A. MINIMUM JUST 'CAUSE THEY WANT TO WIN THE CHAMPIONSHIP  (fe_03_08486-B-0068)

N._B._A. AND THAT WAS SOMETHING WAS AND THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS NEGOTIATED BECAUSE THE PLAYERS STRUCK AND THEY HAD A STRIKE AND THEY DECIDED YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08486-B-0074)
YOU JUST CAN'T FORCE US TO PLAY FOR ANYTHING SO THERE'S GOING TO BE A MINIMUM AND THEY ESTABLISHED THAT SO THEY GOT  (fe_03_08486-B-0075)
I DON'T THINK SO I DON'T THINK THE  (fe_03_08486-B-0076)
HAVING A TROPHY BECAUSE THEY'VE DONE EVERYTHING ELSE THEY'VE CARL MALONE HAS WON M._V._P. HE'S AH MADE MILLIONS  (fe_03_08486-B-0077)
