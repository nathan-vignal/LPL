R:  Hello, um, my name's Heather.
L:  Hi, ah, my name is Cindy.
R:  Hi, Cindy.
L:  How you doing?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, how do you feel about the strikes by professional athletes?
L:  [SIGH] Um, I think anybody that gets paid a million bucks shouldn't strike.  I don't think they have the right to complain, not --
R:  No, I --
L:  -- at all, I mean --
R:  -- I mean, I can see teachers striking, 'cause teachers are underpaid and, you know, they have to do a lot of hard work, and like -- you know, they -- they have made unions, and -- and, you know, all sorts of stuff 'cause they get taken advantage of, but I -- I don't really see how professional athletes are taken advantage of, or ... um ... anything like that.  I -- I almost decided not to participate in this particular one, just because I -- I'm not really into sports, so ...
L:  Well, I am, and -- but my favorite sport is nascar --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and, they don't strike [LAUGH] -- they go out there -- they are the lowest paid -- of all, believe it or not, they are the lowest paid athletes of all, [MN] and they have the highest, you know, they have the most dangerous -- it's the most dangerous sport of all, um, with the highest mortality rate, and everything else, and they go out every single Sunday and their biggest, you know -- there's one --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [MN] you know, and they don't complain, they -- they give them -- it's really, you know um -- so, I don't think that these other [MN] -- it -- it -- it bothers me, really, really, really big that, these other guys who, um, who get paid so much more, and just to go out there and [MN] --
R:  Play.
L:  -- and play.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I -- I -- I -- I think it -- I think it stinks, I think it's -- it's spoilt baby, you know? [MN]
R:  It is.
L:  And the -- the -- the -- one of the things that they're complaining about is that they don't have [MN] proper healthcare I think -- excuse me, you get paid enough money, you know?
R:  You -- you -- they do pay enough to like, you know, um, buy their own insurances, I mean, I -- I really, I can't say, I've ever looked at the health policy of the, ah, the professional athlete, but I can't imagine that it's any worse than what, you know -- I'm an administrative assistant, and I don't have the best health insurance either --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but I'm not on strike.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  [MN] Um ...
L:  Well, I'm retired [LAUGH], but, um, you know, ah, I ran people's businesses, you know, [inaudible] an administrative assistant, office manager, whatever you want to call it --
R:  Yeah, I do that.
L:  -- and ah, I ran other people's businesses and the last two places I worked were churches, and, um, when you work for a church you don't get health insurance, most of them don't have that, ah, some of them do, you know, ah because it's the denomination that has it, but, yeah, I just -- I just don't see [MN] -- prima donnas -- that's the word that comes --
R:  I just -- yeah, I just don't see how they have it so tough, you know?  Like, ah, they -- they -- they do get, like, they get paid an incredible amount of money, they're not really in all that much danger, like -- like, you said the nascar people are in a lot more danger and they don't ah, they don't go on strike, and --
L:  No, and another thing too, the nascar teams and the individual nascar -- they give away more -- they donate more --
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  -- to, um, charities and things like that, um, I was looking at a -- I -- sometimes when I'm on- online I circle round stuff --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they were talking about the top people that donate, um, [MN] famous people in the world --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- that give to charities and stuff --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, and the percentages of their income and all that kind of stuff --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and in the top fifty there was a wh- -- you know, a whole bunch of -- of um, nascar drivers.  There was very few, you know, Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson I think were the only two that I even recognized the name of --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- and they're retired, aren't they?  [LAUGH] They're both retired now, um, there -- you know, very few --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- football players and things, you know, they were like -- later down, like a hundred or so, you know, down the list, 'cause they had like, top one hun- -- five hundred or something like that.  But still, I was just looking at the top fifty and all, but mostly there was nascar, and then a lot of computer folks, and, um, [SIGH] but, when it came to amounts of money that was donated and where they -- where they went in as really being in the top --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- was when they gave percent ah -- percentage of income --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] because they have a lower salary than these other people --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- and they really rated higher, and there was more nascar drivers up there than there was anything else, and I just said, " [inaudible]", you know.
R:  I think studies have shown, I mean, this isn't really relevant, so I guess I should get off it, but studies have shown that the lower one's income is, the more [MN] of their income they're likely to donate to charity --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that the people who make the least, are the people who donate the most, really.  Probably 'cause they're the people who most know what it's like to be without --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I guess these athletes that make all this money, just have no concept of what it is to be -- like, on strike legitimately -- like, to be a nurse who's forced to work, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, eighty hours a week, or whatever, you know, how -- how some nurses in some hospitals are just told they have to stay overtime, and the same thing happens, even with doctors, like it -- and they can't really -- I mean, sometimes they do go on strike, but they can't really, because it's like, people die if they go on strike, whereas you know, the worst thing that happens if an athlete goes on strike, is, oh, someone doesn't get to see a game they wanna see, so it's kind of -- it's not as -- they're -- they're more at liberty, to like, oh, not at liberty, but it's more [LIPSMACK] -- you know what I mean?  It's less of a pressing matter if they -- they go on strike.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know.
L:  Um ...
R:  Maybe I shouldn't have talked about this, 'cause I really -- I -- I -- just the idea of professional athletes is kind of silly to me, like I think that -- that with -- with few exceptions, like okay, nascar, you need to be trained to do that, you know, you shouldn't just go doing that in your backyard, but lots of games, I -- I -- I just -- I think that -- that takes away from the fun of it.
L:  Yeah, baseball, in the most recent one w- -- they want -- biggest one was -- there were, um, was baseball.  My feeling was bounce back, you know, [several inaudible words] up -- they were talking about -- well, the owners and managers -- the owners were making, as far as they were concerned, too much money.  Well, the owners are the ones who have to keep up the stadiums, I mean, they have a lot of expenses --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, these athletes don't have any expenses, why should their percentage of the take be higher?  You know?  They're already paying them all this money, [MN] it -- it -- it rattles me that they want more of the pie, when they don't have all the expenses and everything.
R:  I think -- it's crazy, but the more some people make, the more their sense of entitlement grows, you know, so, they --
L:  That's a thought.
R:  -- they get all this money, they went from being noone to being a professional athlete and they got all this money, and then they just decided they deserved even more than that, and they're just, um ...
L:  [MN] And I want to laugh when they sit there and go, "But, I worked hard to get where I'm at", and I'm going, "Duh, you worked hard?  You go out and you play, boy", you know, I play baseball, I know, you know?  It's [LAUGH] -- it -- it's just [MN], you know, it's -- it's just a -- it's a point of irritation for me, I really get very, very upset over that.  I think it's -- that [SIGH] -- I -- I just -- I -- it irritates me, you know, that they -- that they feel like they're justified and that they deserve it -- I just don't think they deserve -- I don't think -- [inaudible] it's like corporate executives that run these buildings, I don't think anybody's worth a million bucks.
R:  Oh, I mean, who does the -- where does all the money if -- if -- if someone goes on strike because they think they should get paid more -- where does this extra money come from?  I mean, are they just charging fans more for games?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Or ...
L:  It comes out of our pocket.
R:  It just ... [SIGH] I don't know, if I were a fan, which I'm really not, but if I were I would, you know, that would be the kind of thing that would discourage me from going, I mean, 'cause it's [MN] -- you know, it's supposed to be enjoyable, it's a form of entertainment, you know, it's -- [MN] something you would do to get your mind off --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- all your troubles, and then, you know, it's -- if they're having their own soap opera --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- then, it's -- you know, you have enough trouble in your own life and you shouldn't have to have, you know, your -- your means of entertainment, um, disrupted because -- I don't know, it's -- it's almost like they take themselves too seriously, you know, it's not like they're brain surgeons, or -- or -- or -- you know, nuclear physicists, or whatever, they're playing a game -- they're pretty easily replaced, in my mind, you know? 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, there are lots of excellent ball players and only a few of them get, you know --
L:  Picked.
R:  -- get picked to be in these -- in these teams, and [SIGH] -- I don't know, I would think the threat of being replaced should be enough to make them not wanna rock the boat too much, but ...
L:  Well, they think that they -- well, and see, that's a -- another thing, like, this morning with Koby Bryant --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and this stuff that's been going on, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, and it's not just him, but I mean we have -- the -- we have a higher percentage of it going on, I mean, it sounds like, like every week it's a different one, you know?  Um, I think that they think that they're above ... everything, you know?
R:  I think part of it is that the -- they're only useful for a very small part of their lives, you know, like that -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I mean, you know, in this -- in this venue -- they can only be a professional athlete for, you know -- what?  Ten years or something?  I don't know exactly what the limit is, but you know what I'm saying?  Like, it's not like a life long thing, so maybe they feel like they have this short amount of time in which they have to, you know, like, squeeze the most out of it as possible, I -- I mean, I don't -- I can't say I really understand where they're coming from, but ...
L:  I don't --
R:  [inaudible] -- I guess it's possible.
L:  -- I just don't, you know?  Um, we live on a ...
