L:  [NOISE] Hi, there.
R:  Hi, there, this is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Vicky.  Who's this?
L:  [SIGH]  My name is Teresa.  [SIGH]
R:  Hi, Teresa.
L:  Where are you from?  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  I'm calling -- actually I'm calling right now from --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Connecticut where I work, but I live in Westchester [NOISE] County in New York.
L:  O- o- oh, okay.
R:  And you're calling from?
L:  [SIGH]  Tennessee.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, my goodness, that's quite --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a ways away.
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  I bet we had real different --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- experiences on [LAUGH] September E- [LAUGH] Eleventh.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  That's what I was fixing to say.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  That's like, you know, I'll bet this is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- this topic has affected you, [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, you know, a hundred times more than it has ever affected m- [LAUGH] me.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Yes and no.  I mean, certainly in the way that people do things.  There's actually a very [NOISE] interesting story.  I was actually [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- flying on September E- Eleventh.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Were you really?  [SIGH]
R:  I was flying out of ... JFK --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on the nine AM flight from --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- New York to LA --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that didn't take [NOISE] off because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they were backed up --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on the runway and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they closed things down but there were some reports in the New York Times --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that actually --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] it was probably an additional targeted flight, but it hadn't taken off.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Oh, I was gonna say, I mean, all the other ones were going to LA, weren't they, --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, --
L:  -- or at least California.
R:  -- and basically they were ... doing [NOISE] a lot of investigation --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of that flight.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  They cancelled my credit cards.
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, my goodness!  Really?
R:  Because I guess they were trying to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- t- trace down people who they thought --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- were on that flight so they, [SIGH] and --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- basically this was my -- I bought it on a business card and, um, [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I got a note basically saying, "For security reasons --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- we're [NOISE] reissuing your card, --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- e- expect your new one in the mail".
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  "We can't give you any --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- further [NOISE] i- information".  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  O- oh, my goodness!  [NOISE]
R:  So, [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]  S- s- so, ...  [NOISE]
R:  -- so it was -- it was very traumatic [NOISE] but in a way for -- more for some of the [NOISE] people who care about me 'cause I knew I was fine.
L:  [SIGH]  O- oh, yeah, I bet.
R:  But people couldn't get hold of me.
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Oh, my goodness!
R:  You know I -- I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- was, ah, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [NOISE]  [SIGH] it was interesting --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- actually I -- I reached my husband --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- first by email --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- because there are terminals in the, -- y- you know, all the cell phones were jammed and closed down.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  No one could call anything.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  But the email terminals were working.
L:  [NOISE]  [MN]  So, you got a hold of him --
R:  So, people --
L:  -- that way?  [NOISE]
R:  -- were waiting in line at, like, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- these free email terminals, writing, like, a one sentence thing to their most important person saying, "Hi, I'm on the ground.  I'm okay" [SIGH] --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and letting someone else have the machine.
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  A- [LAUGH] and, ah, [NOISE] -- you know, it -- it took me [NOISE] -- it took me over twenty four hours to actually get home.
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, really?
R:  Because all the highways were closed.
L:  Oh, my goodness!  [NOISE]
R:  So, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I ended up getting [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- staying with somebody who was on the right side of the river, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- 'cause I live across the river [SIGH] and they wouldn't let anybody --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- in from any of the bridges.  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Are you a little bit more worried about getting on planes now?  [SIGH]
R:  You know, I'm n- not, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- which is, you know, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- some people think it's funny, some people got really freaked out or whatever.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  I flew for business, like, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- four weeks later --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I don't ... have a p- [LAUGH] problem.  [LAUGH]
L:  You don't have a problem?  [LAUGH]
R:  I really don't I mean I guess my feeling is --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- that, you know, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- something can happen to you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- anywhere --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  That's true.  [NOISE]
R:  -- and you got to just live your life.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Yeah, that -- that's definitely t- [LAUGH] true.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, and, ah, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- no, I've got a lot of friends who got to do real, -- ah, folks who do, you know, rescue and EMT and things --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- who, you know, were at the site for a month and a half and, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, doing a lot of stuff.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I didn't get [NOISE] too involved --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- directly.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, we were certainly really pretty shaken up but I --
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  -- didn't -- it didn't really change sort of h- how [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I run my life at all.  I don't know.  And -- and I think that's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- been the case for a lot of New Yorkers, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we're tough people, I g- [LAUGH] guess.  [LAUGH]  I don't know.
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Oh, really?  [SIGH]  You know, sometimes I think -- now see it [NOISE] -- it didn't change my life any.  I'm not [SIGH] [NOISE] -- I live in a small town in Tennessee, --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- and I mean, you know, [SIGH] we don't have any airports around here.  [SIGH]  You know, we d- don't have a- anything important around [LAUGH] h- [LAUGH] here, [SIGH] y- [LAUGH] you know.  [LAUGH]  There is -- there's just nothing that ... w- would ever make me think that a terror -- terrorist would even have [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.  Do you have, ah, mu- --
L:  -- think of [NOISE] --
R:  -- do you have much of an --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ethnic M- Muslim --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- community in your area at all --
L:  [NOISE]  No.
R:  -- as well?
L:  No.  [NOISE]
R:  No, so, you don't --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- really tend to see M- Muslim folks really --
L:  [NOISE]  I -- I know --
R:  -- on a day to day basis, --
L:  -- I live in a --
R:  -- huh?
L:  -- p- prominently white --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a- ah, ... town.  [NOISE]
R:  Okay.
L:  [SIGH]  We -- I think there's, like, maybe [SIGH] [NOISE] thirty something thousand people in Crossville.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  I mean it's, like, real, real, small.  [SIGH]  U- um, I was looking at the census in the -- in the newspaper.  [SIGH]  We have, ah, five hundred ... black people ... who live in Crossville, [SIGH] [NOISE] which in a town of thirty thousand those five hundred get l- [LAUGH] lost.  [LAUGH]
R:  My goodness, yes.
L:  I was -- I was really s- shocked [NOISE] --
R:  And especially considering --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that presumably people are here --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in families, you're talking --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- w- w- w- what, --
L:  Oh!  [NOISE]
R:  -- maybe two hundred families, right?
L:  [SIGH]  Ah, ... I --
R:  [SIGH]  Y- [LAUGH] you know.
L:  --if even that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I wasn't even sure where they got that five hundred number from.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  I mean, because I can go, you know, ... f- for weeks at a time here in Crossville [SIGH] and not see any black people whatsoever.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  U- um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we have a -- a kind of large hispanic [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- community around here.
R:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Um, but other than that, you know, Muslims, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- yeah, I don't see any -- anyone [SIGH] like that, ah, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] it's mostly hispanics --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that we see and --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- [SIGH] and so, you know, when all that happened and all it -- it was kind of like [SIGH] ... it was in another c- country, y- [LAUGH] you know.  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  You -- when --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you watch terrorist --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- things in another country you're --
R:  Uh-huh.  It's true.
L:  -- [SIGH] you're kind of like [SIGH] --
R:  It felt very distant to you guys, huh?
L:  It -- it was -- it was kind of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it was k- --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- kind of distant, you know, I didn't know anybody who lived in New York.  I didn't, [SIGH] you know, I -- even in the area I didn't know anybody who was flying.  I didn't, -- [SIGH] you know, I knew everybody t- that I knew --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- was [LAUGH] here in the south with m- [LAUGH] me.  [LAUGH]
R:  Y- [NOISE] yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  And, ah, [SIGH] [NOISE] -- and it was it was kind of like watching, y- you know, ah, terrorist things, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, you see in the news and [SIGH] you see about, you know, bombing somewhere else and you're, like, [SIGH] "Oh, that's terrible" and, you know, [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but you don't feel like it [SIGH] affects y- you --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- directly.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  You know that.
R:  Yeah, it's a really different experience.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean I think that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- p- probably everybody h- here --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- was no more than, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, two steps away from --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  --losing somebody.
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, yeah.
R:  You know, like, people in my church lost people and --
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  -- that kind of thing, [NOISE] you know, not -- not -- I didn't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- lose anyone [NOISE] directly but, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] you know, you didn't have to go to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- didn't have to go too far --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- to, you know, find --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- somebody who was dealing with that through the whole community.  And, again, we're up in Westchester which --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- yeah, it's a suburb of Manhattan --
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.
R:  -- essentially, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] which is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- maybe thirty miles away.
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  Um, now --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's a very ... emotionally --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- strong thirty miles.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It really feels like the city in a way --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is a very different place.
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
R:  [MN]  But, you know, r- realistically it's very near by.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  A lot of people who lived where I live --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- work in the city.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, --
L:  [SIGH]  That ... [NOISE] I --
R:  -- you know, a lot --
L:  -- I'm sure it would.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- of people will commute in [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- from there a- and, you know, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a lot of people --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- who were in the city [NOISE] -- happened to be in the city that day --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but weren't in that part of town --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or, [SIGH] you know, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- weren't ... doing stuff there.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  S- so, yeah, it -- it's close --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but, [SIGH] you don't find now --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that a lot of people --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't think people in the long term have really changed their behavior that much.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I think there was unfortunately --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a lot more [SIGH] changes in behavior in terms of people ... having --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a lot of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] tough time around Muslim people --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- than about, like, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- h- how they chose to do things.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  It's -- especially, flying out of New York which, ah, for a short period of time was really --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- u- um, h- high security in a way that was almost funny.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I fly sometimes out of the White Plains Airport here --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- which is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] a small little airport, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think it's four gates --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or something.
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  [MN]  But it technically --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is a New York area airport.
L:  [NOISE]  [MN]
R:  So, they were stopping people --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a mile away to check their cars out.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  They had National Guards swarming [NOISE] all over it.
L:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, --  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Well, we've been having --
R:  And they -- they opened up --
L:  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- every single person's luggage when --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we went and went through every ... t- thing.  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  And because it --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- it's a small enough airport that the volume is low --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but it was as high security --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- as other New York airports, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and they were just going through --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] I mean, the National Guard guys looked s- so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it was so funny --
L:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because they're in the full thing with the big machine guns and everything and they're standing in ... really this l- lobby because it's a four gate --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- little piece of nothing a- [LAUGH] airport.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  O- o- oh!  Well --
R:  I mean, I guess, I appreciated it but it, ah, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, when a -- but they were basically --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- putting the same s- security that they were using --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for La Guardia International --
L:  [NOISE]  O- o- oh!
R:  -- [SIGH] for White Plains Airport --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because it is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it is, I guess, the closest --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- airport [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- not counting the big three there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and actually, um, [MN] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the Clintons use it a lot.
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, really?
R:  They've got --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- when they fly in and out [NOISE] private --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- stuff, um, they use --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that a lot because they live right over here.
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  O- o- oh, okay.
R:  So, I guess, for that reason --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they wanted to keep the security high.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But it was really kind of ridiculous.  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  We did have one incident, I do have to say, after [SIGH] [NOISE] -- we do have a very small airport but it's mostly --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- just for, um, [MN] little [NOISE] single engine planes, you know.  People who have a plane that live around here [NOISE] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [SIGH] kind of thing.  [NOISE]  [MN]  We did build a [SIGH] [NOISE] large +airstrip -- airstrip [SIGH] in case --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of, you know, like [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the fl- -- all the planes had to land that day, [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, ah, if that ever happened again [SIGH] [NOISE] somebody could land here ... now.  [SIGH]
R:  Right.
L:  Ah, the airstrip was not large enough --
R:  So, it's big enough to land a commercial plane now.
L:  -- no, it was not big enough and they build one that is big enough to land a commercial flight.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  U- um, that's -- we --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they did have an incident where a plane landed, [SIGH] it was probably a month after that, --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- over here at the airport without c- clearance.  [NOISE]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  A- and, I mean they had c- cops down there.  They -- we have a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- an [SIGH] an army, um, --
R:  [NOISE]  [COUGH]
L:  -- um, oh, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] like a R -- [SIGH] not the ROTC but, um, [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [MN] oh, Reserves --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- I think.  [SIGH]  And I think they -- they called all the Reserves over and [SIGH] there were fire trucks and stuff like that and it's -- [NOISE] it's just a guy who just [NOISE] ... was -- I think he was drunk.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really!
L:  He shouldn't have been f- flying the plane in the first place.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Well, if he was just flying his private plane --
L:  [SIGH]  And he just landed --
R:  -- and just kind of forgot --
L:  -- y- [LAUGH] yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- to get himself cleared, huh?  [SIGH]
L:  Exactly.  And, you know, ah, that was [NOISE] -- that was about [LAUGH] the --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- only thing.  [LAUGH]
R:  That's funny.  [NOISE]
L:  O- o- oh!  Not --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- a lot of smart people.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  That's one of the things that, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, I like living about -- ah, in -- ah, -- [NOISE] in Crossville is that we were v- voted, [SIGH] [NOISE] quite a few years back, [SIGH] as one of the top ten small towns to live in, in the United States.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  And, ah, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we have a very low crime rate here.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  I mean it's extremely safe.  If someone [NOISE] ... gets m- murdered around here [SIGH] it's usually a bar fight, [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know.  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]  [COUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I apologize for this cough, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [NOISE] I'm just getting over something.
L:  O- o- oh!  [LAUGH]
R:  [inaudible]  [NOISE]
L:  But, ah, [SIGH] [NOISE] so, you know, I guess that's one of the things is that we all just sit around w- --
