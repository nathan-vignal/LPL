R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  Oh great, two females talking about sports [LAUGH].
L:  Huh?
R:  I said, "Two females talking about sports".
L:  Yeah.  My name's Val.
R:  Hi, I'm Sylvia.
L:  Hi.
R:  Ah --
L:  Um, yeah, when they -- when they first started -- when they first said the situation, I thought they meant like, strikes as in, you know, bad things against people, kinda like the three strikes and you're out law, or whatever.
R:  Yeah, I thought they were talk- -- ah, the first thing that came to mind was that baseball ...
L:  Yeah, see, I'm in Wisconsin and that's --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- [MN] this, just happened with the guy beating the -- the per- -- the other person, or whatever.
R:  The hotdog?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  That's big news in our area, but okay, the topic -- I don't know --
R:  I think they're definitely overpaid.
L:  I definitely think they're overpaid, um --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- my opinion [NOISE] -- I'm sorry, go ahead.
R:  No, that's -- go ahead [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] My opinion is that, you know, the -- not only are they overpaid, but they're trying to get paid for more, but I tr- -- I always try to look at both sides of the situation, you know, um, they have a [MN] job, that could potentially -- especially in areas like football or hockey, that could potentially kill them and or injure them, so their income is what they're expecting, you know, possibly to earn for a lifetime, over the course of, like, ten years, as opposed to spread out.
R:  Yeah, but at the same time, I mean, when you look at, ah, firefighters and policemen, who --
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  -- you know, are definitely, um, in far more danger --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- um, every day they go to work, um, and compared -- and I just think our society's got our priorities really out of whack.
L:  Definitely.
R:  I --
L:  Yeah, I never even thought about the firefighter, policeman --
R:  Yeah, when -- when --
L:  -- difference.
R:  -- and they're -- it's -- they -- they want more -- the sports -- the athletes want more money because [SIGH], um, the club owners get [MN], you know, make millions off of 'em --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, through advertising, and stuff, so I mean, it's -- it's all based [SIGH], um, you know, people are willing to buy the products, the products are willing to spend the advertising dollars and, um, the club owners are willing to take the money, and the players are the ones that's doing the grunt work for it, but, I don't know, maybe we oughta get advertisers to, ah, sponsor our firemen and policemen.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Put a big Coca Cola [SIGH] emblem on the side of a fire truck, or something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But ...
L:  Well, and it's like [MN], you know, this is such a [MN] ... iffy situation, 'cause so many people say, okay, even in times of trouble, and whatever t- -- that, you know, that's a lighter thing to keep their minds off -- I remember after, like, September eleventh, they had like, only a couple of games cancelled in honor and then decided, okay, we're supposed to get back to our lives, let's keep our minds, you know, on other things --
R:  Oh, yeah --
L:  -- so --
R:  -- I agree with ya, I mean, diversion's always necessary, even during the Great Depression, um, people still made movies and people still, you know, went to see 'em when they could afford it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and Shirley Temple gained her popularity on -- during the Great Depression, but, ah, [SIGH] I agree, there -- there's always the need for the diversion, but, man, for the money they're getting paid, I just --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- actors and athletes, they just -- I -- I think it's way out of balance.
L:  Yeah, I know, it's -- there's [SIGH] so much differences in all of it, you know, and it's like the majority of the people have this god given skill that, you know, they just had to develop as opposed to, you know, having to do extra to learn it, or you know?
R:  Right.
L:  So, it's like, people out there that are, you know, going to school, like doctors or whatever, you know, saving lives who don't make even nearly that [MN] amount.
R:  Oh, I agree, I agree, um, as far as the -- the strikes against them and stuff, I'm not sure what the -- I couldn't quite understand the, um --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- the message.
L:  Well, she was saying -- she was saying -- they were saying about, um, if we feel that the strikes to make more money, are [MN] right or wrong.
R:  Oh, definitely wrong, oh gee.
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  I mean, it's -- it's [MN] ...
L:  [MN] Well, and I know in our area, like I said, I'm in Wisconsin and a c- -- you know, a coupla years back, we didn't have baseball, like, the entire season due to strikes, and I know pe- -- a lot of people were really upset about it, they're like, "Okay, you're getting paid how much?  And you can't even playing during, you know, during, you know, discussions --", it's like okay, no, we're not gonna play 'cause we're not getting enough money.
R:  Yeah, that's -- that's ridiculous -- that's [SIGH], oh, I mean it -- it's just like, how selfish can somebody be?  I mean, yeah, it's okay to wanna make money, but, [SIGH] um, you know, they're fortunate enough to be a professional baseball player, or football player, or whatever --
L:  Mhm [MN].
R:  -- I mean, there's thousands upon thousands of ah, people out there that would love to be able to play pro ball --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they're lucky --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- to be able to do it.
L:  [MN] I mean, I can't even imagine that amount of money, ah, to me that's just mind boggling --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I heard somebody, I don't remember who it was, I'm not very into sport, but I heard somebody -- one of the players was making more than the president.
R:  Oh, I don't doubt it.  The president doesn't really make a whole lot of money -- you'd be -- you'd be amazed at the salary from [SIGH] -- oh, I remember, I think back in the seventies -- late seventies, when I was in college -- I think at that point in time, um, the president, um, makes -- [MN] made a little over a hundred thousand a year.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah, but it's -- they don't make a whole lot of money, um, they're definitely not in it for the job.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But they get great perks [LAUGH].
L:  Right.
R:  You get your very own seven forty seven jet, you know?  [LAUGH] A whole army at your disposal --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- [LAUGH] the IRS [LAUGH].
L:  Oh ri- -- yeah.
R:  They got perks [LAUGH].
L:  [SIGH]
R:  But, um, yeah, I'm not --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- really into sports myself, but I just, um, I just disagree with how much money they make and -- and the fact that they're striking, ah, that's just ...
L:  Well, [MN] maybe if I --
R:  It -- it repulses me, to be honest.
L:  -- maybe if I was a big sports fan I could, maybe justify it in my mind or something --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but not really being into sports [inaudible], I go, "How does this make any sense?".
R:  Yeah.  I -- I agree with you, um, you know and it's -- it's -- but there's also a big side industry of -- of the gambling, which I just recently learned about -- I was like totally amazed at, um, the amount of money that's involved and -- and legal -- I'm talking strictly legal gambling --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, on -- on sports teams and stuff, um, you got handicappers -- there's a whole industry -- if you ever get on the internet, type in handicapper or sports handicapper --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [several inaudible words] god, you get like, almost a hundred thousand hits or something.
L:  Wow.
R:  I know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that's a whole different industry, too.
L:  Does --
R:  But I don't -- I don't blame the -- the athletes for wanting to get their fair share, but I think they also need to keep in mind that, um, you know, the w- -- I -- I think once people get that kind of money they have a, um, [SIGH] a tendency to become overly self absorbed --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and think -- and -- and think that the whole world revolves around them.
L:  [SIGH] Well, and not only that though, look at the amount of money that the players start out at.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, they start out at so much money, and like, okay, you know, say you start a job at ten dollars an hour --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, every so often, or once a year, or whatever, you expect to get a raise if you're doing your job --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so they start out at this insanely high amount --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and they want raises reflective of that.
R:  Well, the thing that irritates me too, um -- now I live in Charlotte, North Carolina, and we have, ah, the Panthers down here and then we have the Charlotte Hornets and, um, I mean, I don't know if you heard about the big, you know, Ray Carrous[?], um, I can't remember if he was basketball -- I think he was Panthers, basketball, um, and his girlfriend, and ah, she was pregnant and he had her killed.
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  Um, then there was um, ah, [SIGH] [MN] I think they were Hornets, um, let's see -- the Charlotte Hornets is the basketball team, but, we got fed up with them and, um,  kicked them out of the city -- they went to New Orleans [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, the Panthers is our, um, NFL team --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, one of the w- -- ah, one of the Panther, um, players came home from an away game and his wife shot and killed him, um, w- when he was walking in the front door with his baggage.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah, um, [MN] I mean, it wasn't like -- she -- she knew exactly who he was --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, she'd tried to set the house on fire, previously --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- with him in it.  Um, but then -- then we ...
