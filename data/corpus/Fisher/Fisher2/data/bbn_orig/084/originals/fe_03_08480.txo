R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, I'm Pat.
R:  Hi Pat, I'm Shelley.
L:  I'm from the Detroit Metro area, so we've got tons of sports teams here.
R:  You do.  Well, um, I'm from Adeline[?], Texas, so about all we have is college based.
L:  [SIGH] Oh.
R:  Course -- course, you know, not too far from Dallas --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the Dallas Cowboys, but [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they're not a lot to talk about right now.
L:  Well, [MN] neither are the Detroit Tigers, so -- so, we have a lot in common, [SIGH] but, ah, I almost passed on -- on this one [SIGH], um, but I -- I -- I didn't because it irritates me how much money these sports guys earn --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- and -- and they're not happy with it.
R:  Right, and what role do they play in the economy?
L:  [SIGH] Or, what sort of moral characters are they for our kids?
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  You know, I mean, so many of them -- I mean, there were two from, ah, Detroit that were arrested over the weekend for spousal abuse.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, I guess they want us to talk about the strikes.  And, I just think that these people have over inflated egos, over inflated salaries, and they're --
R:  I agree.
L:  -- and they're never satisfied --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- with how much money they get.
R:  Very, very greedy.
L:  Yes.  Now I --
R:  [MN] You know, I mean, [MN] I think they need to step back and take a look at, you know, middle class working people.
L:  Oh my god, they're pr- -- you know, these teams are pricing themselves --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- out of the reach of families, I mean, you can't afford -- like, we, ah, we don't care about football, baseball -- we're strictly hockey fans here, and, for the three of us to go to a hockey game, I mean, tickets are -- well, I think they're fifty dollars a piece now, and this is for upper bowl --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- so, it costs us a hundred and fifty bucks --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- just to attend a game, and of course it's --
R:  That's ridiculous.
L:  -- our team is owned by Little Caesar, so that's -- you know, you eat Little Caesar's pizza there --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it's a tiny baby pizza, and it's seven fifty.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  So, that's -- I mean, that's what?  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Tw- -- almost twenty two, twenty three bucks --
R:  Oh, goodness.
L:  -- and that's just for the ticket and -- and the -- the pizza, so there's --
R:  Well, I -- there's no way I can do that.
L:  No, you know, and -- you know, and we can't do that often.
R:  You know?  That's crazy, it's like if they get just a -- a -- a little bit of a whiff of the riches --
L:  Oh my go- --
R:  -- they'll do whatever they have to do to get more, you know --
L:  R- right.
R:  -- it's like, even if they -- 'cause you see some of these athletes that -- that move from one team, or even move from one sport to the other --
L:  Ex- --
R:  -- all the time.
L:  Exactly.
R:  It's not right, you know --
L:  Well --
R:  -- to me, because they're breaking their contract, and if they break their contract, I don't think they should get paid.
L:  Well, I know, I mean my husband --
R:  But they are.
L:  -- couldn't do that in his job.
R:  Right.
L:  So ...
R:  I think they need to put a legal cap --
L:  Oh, I do too.
R:  -- on how much a professional athlete can make.
L:  I mean, they're making more than the president of the United States.
R:  Right [MN].
L:  You know, for --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- considering how --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- how little they work, and, you know, I mean, they really aren't making lives any better, I mean, maybe for the hour and a half or two hours that you're there, you forget about your problems, but you are really paying for this.
R:  Right, and [MN] -- you know, who should make more than the president?
L:  Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly, so ...
R:  You know, how -- how [MN] --
L:  I don't know [SIGH] --
R:  -- if you compare the president to these athletes, you know, who's more important?
L:  Right, yeah, [MN] yeah, one has, you know, the power to do whatever over all of us, and the other ones are just spoilt babies.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That were born -- they were blessed with the talent that the rest of us don't have --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they -- [MN] they overcapitalize on it, and then --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and then, they're not happy, and they wanna go on strike.
R:  Right.
L:  So -- I mean, I don't begrudge anybody making, ah, you know, a good earning, I mean, I want my husband to make whatever he can so that we could live a comfortable life, but ah, I mean this is ridiculous, like [inaudible] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- for the Red Wings -- we offered him -- oh, Illich[?] offered him fifty million over five years -- ten million --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a year --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he turned it down.  
R:  [MN]
L:  And then -- and then he went to free agency last week, so I'm thinking --
R:  You know, these -- these are not -- to me, those are not -- [MN] I think they look at 'em as jobs, but --
L:  Oh, of course they do.
R:  -- to me those are not a job.  You -- you -- that's your play --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- that's your play, and you -- you're not producing anything that's essential to life or business.
L:  Exactly, yeah, what are [MN] --
R:  You know?
L:  -- seriously, what are they contributing?  Nothing.
R:  Right.
L:  But, so -- no, I definitely am against teams being a -- sports teams being able to strike, I -- I mean, I don't wanna hold anybody down money wise, but I mean, this is insane.
R:  [inaudible] right, it is, I mean, just like you were talking while ago, you know, the cost of attendance is getting to the point where, you know, who is gonna be able to pay --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that kind of admission and -- and the refreshment prices?
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know?  Middle class people -- it's gonna get to where they can't --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and -- and the -- the upper class people -- a lot of them couldn't care less about sports.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I don't know -- Red Wings arena, ah, our Joe Lewis, I mean, it's always packed, I mean, it's standing room only, and I'm wondering, how can all these people afford this?  We only have one child, so, you know, we could do it once in a while, but I mean, if you have two, three, four kids, I mean, that's gonna blow three hundred bucks for a night.
R:  Mhm, exactly.
L:  So, I don't see how they fill the, you know, the arenas anyway --
R:  Right --
L:  -- but ...
R:  -- I mean, you know, how can they -- how can they expect to call themselves professional?
L:  Yeah, oh, I don't know.
R:  You know?
L:  Well, they hold themselves above us.
R:  [MN] They've -- they've -- they've forgotten what that professional means --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just [MN] exactly like you were talking about, you know, role models.
L:  Exactly, but --
R:  It just [inaudible] ...
L:  -- you [MN] -- I -- I saw -- I -- I cannot imagine why they'd wanna strike, with the money they're making, why would they strike?
R:  Really?  Exactly, I just, you know [SIGH] --
L:  You know, I could --
R:  I'm really -- I cho- -- I am really down on a lot of the athletes right now, it just seems like, you know, they're just -- they're [MN] -- they're all -- they're constantly getting busted for drugs, and domestic violence, and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, stuff like that, you -- you hear about that all the time, and you would think, "My god, look where you sit --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- look at the money you're making -- look -- look at who's watching you", you know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- if anyone, you should be doing, you know, a little bit better than -- than a preacher as far as role models [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, my goodness, yeah, or then but -- and, you know, what they throw back at us, is -- and look at Clinton -- we had a president who was an embarrassment --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, so, why are we complaining about sports stars, so --
R:  Mhm, I don't --
L:  -- there's always an out for them.
R:  Personally, I don't care if they strike.
L:  I don't either.
R:  I don't really care [LAUGH].
L:  I don't -- well, they're talking about a --
R:  You know?
L:  -- hockey lockout in oh four, so, we are paranoid about that, but, ah --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- as far as the strike goes, I certainly wouldn't, you know, I wouldn't go along with them --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I certainly wouldn't support any sports team if they would go on strike.
R:  Mm mm, no, I wouldn't, I mean, let 'em strike, you know, it gets to the point where they need to make their house payment, and payments on their cars, their boat, and all their fancy doodad --
L:  All their goodies, all their toys.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, I have no sympathy --
R:  Mm mm.
L:  -- you know, we are middle class --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we don't have Ferraris, or Porsches, or Jags, and they do, so, to me, they should shut up --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- play, and be happy with the money they're getting.
R:  Exactly, yes, I agree [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, my god.
R:  Actually, I could probably use stronger ones -- words than just shut up, but ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, yes, but we're being recorded [LAUGH].
R:  That's right, yep ...
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah, I tell you, it's just incredible.
L:  So, I -- I don't -- I don't know -- this would of probably been a better subject for my husband or my son --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but, basically we all feel the same, I mean --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- we love the Red Wings, but I mean, they are -- they are overpaid.
R:  Mhm, [SIGH] I mean, [MN] I think -- don't most athletes start out, like, around two hundred thousand a year?
L:  Oh, yeah, and that's -- that's just for the rookies, that's, yeah, that's for the cheapies.
R:  Yeah, and then, yeah 'cause most of them make several times that -- that amount of money.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's like, "Hello" --
L:  I know.
R:  -- do you know what I would give just to make two hundred thousand a year?  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh my god, that would a -- that would be wonderful --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- we wouldn't strike if we were making that much.
R:  Really, I mean, my husband and I both work, and you know, if, [MN] when we finish out our tax forms, you know, if we've made forty thousand after taxes, you know ...
L:  Oh, I know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you're happy, you're -- you know, I -- really, that's the American dream --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, I mean, we've got two goalies now, and I mean, they're both making eight million a year, and I'm thinking, "Hello, people ..." --
R:  Right.
L:  -- this guy stands there and they shoot pucks at him, I mean, I know they're both good, well --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- Kujo[?] isn't that good, but Harshick[?] is coming back, so -- but, that's eight million dollars a year.
R:  Gee.
L:  So ...
R:  [MN] It's like, okay, [LAUGH] "Shut up, [LAUGH] and play the game". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah, they are such whiner --
R:  Mhm
L:  -- cry babies --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, I thought movie stars were pampered --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- but the sports stars are just as bad.
R:  They are -- they need to wake up and pull their heads out of their butts. [LAUGH] 
L:  I think so too, I -- I really do, yeah, it's --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- time and really, if they -- if they would go on strike -- economy is so bad, I really don't think that their fans would support them, I mean, we wouldn't --
R:  Mm mm.
L:  -- but I don't think generally speaking, fans would support the teams that strike.
R:  No, I wouldn't.
L:  So ... well, I mean, like the Tigers -- they can't afford to go on strike, they're -- I think they've only won, maybe three games this season --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so far, so ...
R:  Really?  [LAUGH]
