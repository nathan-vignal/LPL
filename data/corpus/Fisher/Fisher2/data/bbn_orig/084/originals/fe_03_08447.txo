L:  Hello.
R:  Hello, how are you? [NOISE]
L:  Hi, I'm fine.  My name is Penny and yours?
R:  Hi, Penny, my name's Kevin.  I guess our topic today is September eleventh, huh?
L:  Yeah.
R:  What do you think?
L:  I don't know, I -- I actually don't really perceive any true change in my life --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, in any direct fashion, uh, since --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- September eleventh, uh, um, I don't think I've really changed anything I've done I still don't do as much travelling as I like but I still do travel some -- I, um, you know, I -- I, you know, I guess been inconvenienced a little bit at the airports and things like that but --
R:  It's ab- --
L:  -- uh, you know.  But I don't know, have -- have you -- where do you live -- I live on -- I live in the West Coast, I live in Portland, Oregon.
R:  Oh, do you, yeah, I live actually in Michigan.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  In the beautiful rainy -- well, of course [NOISE] I can't really complain, I was gonna say compared to you guys probably. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I don't know, I don't know, you know, we actually -- right now, I mean, in the last few -- you know, we -- it hasn't -- I don't know, I -- I don't think it's as rainy as people tend to think it is and -- and we have the most beautiful, glorious summers here.
R:  Oh, that would be great.
L:  No humidity.
R:  [MN]
L:  Seventies or eighties.
R:  Gee, the humidity here is just terrible.
L:  Right, very few mosquitos.
R:  I mean -- but --
L:  Very nice, I like Portland actually.
R:  Yeah, I [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It would be a nice place to live, you know, I -- I -- you know, after September eleventh, I mean, I'm not saying things have changed --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- much with me but I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I guess I'm more aware, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of possible, you know, wher- world events.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Different cultures.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, try to understand why the -- you know, I hate to say it but in America, I mean, American general, you know, we're kind of a -- a hated people, you know, and it's -- [MN] you know, and that's kind of unfortunate, you know, I -- I think we have a select few, you know, kind of dictating, you know, the way the whole nation is perceived.  But, you know, a lot of the --
L:  Well, yeah, I -- yeah, I don't know, I mean, um, yeah, I think it is interesting to think a little bit about, uh, America and what our impact is on the rest of the world.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, and, um, and I -- I don't -- yeah, I don't know I -- I -- I guess -- I mean, and -- and I think that, um, you know, in some ways we're -- we're much disliked for some of the thing we actually do --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then I think in some ways we're just, like, as a symbol of modernity --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- which has its problems, you know.
R:  Yeah, that's --
L:  Um --
R:  -- I mean, it's really quite the truth --
L:  Um --
R:  -- you know.
L:  I mean, I know, I lived -- many years ago I lived in -- in -- in Europe.  I always sort of thought the people had mixed feelings about Americans even in -- in -- in Western Europe --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that there's a kind of a jealously plus, um, we're a little --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't know if arrogant is really quite the right word but sort of.
R:  Well, yeah, I -- you know, I -- I [LAUGH] think it is, you know.  I think arrogant is kind of a, you know, um, a word that really kinda fits quite a few of the people.  I mean, we really think we can pretty much go anywhere, do anything and we should be treated like prized possessions, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like I say, uh, you know, September eleventh is really -- [MN] you know, I don't necessarily know waking me up but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- maybe tried to make me pay more attention --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to, you know, what could be going on.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, I mean, [SIGH] you know, like I say, I live in a very small town in Michigan --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, and when all that happened, you know, I -- you know, I -- I told my wife I'd never been so happy in my life to live in --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, in Otsego [LAUGH], you know --
L:  Oh, I do understand.
R:  -- a place that not many people have heard of.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And --
L:  Is that in the Northern Peninsula or is that --
R:  No, it's actually -- it's actually down -- I don't know if you're familiar, like with Grand Rapids.
L:  Actually my mother was from Grand Rapids.
R:  Yep, I mean, I live maybe twenty minutes from there.
L:  Oh okay.
R:  You know, and it's -- it -- [SIGH] you know, I -- I went through many things, I mean, you know, you always think about smallpox, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and you think of all the threats but you really can't live your life, you know, sheltered you -- you just [NOISE] [SIGH] you know it --
L:  Well, I think that -- that -- that -- that's, you know, one of the things that I -- I thought was sort of interesting too was how much impact, you know, that event had, I mean, I actually am from New York originally and I actually used to even work in the World Trade Center --
R:  Mm [NOISE].
L:  -- and I have many, you know, close and dear friends still in New York and -- and so it impacted me in that emotional --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- way.  Um, and I think for -- you know, for a lot of people, you know, uh, you know, I -- but then when I thought, like, you know, about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- what so many other people's lives are like everyday and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- how much we take or granted --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- not even just the economic and, uh, [inaudible] that we enjoy but -- but the peace that we have always enjoyed and especially --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- on our own territory, um, I, um, you know, I -- I -- I think in some ways there -- not that I think there was anything good about it but that I -- that there a constructive, uh, aspect and that we could little -- think a little bit about -- about those things, uh --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- um, you know, and in how very lucky, uh, we are and -- and -- but still I think some of us are still a little too, um -- nah, I don't know like w- we don't really even still -- aren't still able to quite do it that way, we always just think, you know, what a terrible thing happened to us rather than --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- thinking about what about all the terrible things that have happened to other people around the world --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- all the time actually.
R:  That stuff is happening to -- yeah, like you were saying --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- people around the world every day.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, like in, you know, Israel and, you know, Jerusalem --
L:  Mhm
R:  -- you know, and the -- and, you know, that stuff happens to them every single day.
L:  Every single day, yes --
R:  I mean --
L:  -- and I actually -- I am actually Jewish and my children had, let me think, they had just been -- they had spent the year in Israel the year before.
R:  Wow.
L:  They were there just at the beginning of the second Intifada they -- my oldest was -- went to do her junior year abroad, she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania and my youngest --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- decided before starting college to do a program, um, which she did and -- and, uh, you know, I -- I -- I can remember, you know, when they first --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when it first started happening which was in -- in the previous September actually before September eleventh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I remember I was -- and I started hearing -- I was hearing about what was going on I -- I just became so upset I -- I was so terrified for my children but then, you know, my kids are really very -- you know, they're -- they're girls for one thing and I think it makes them less risk taking than boys to begin with --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but they're very sensible kids and I knew that they wouldn't, you know -- and they were also involved in programs that would take of them and they wouldn't just -- you know, wouldn't just leave them out there with no supervision or no assistance in figuring out how to do or what to do.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  And I actually went to visit them, um, in the spring and -- and, uh, as you said, I mean, people go on and they live -- figure out how to live their lives every day --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but still, um, you know, um, I still find people sort of pretty [inaudible] about what happens in Israel in many ways.  We don't really fully appreciate, um --
R:  No.
L:  And some of the decisions that Israel, which I may or may not disagree with on some level but I can understand it, I mean, jeeze --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if people were, I don't know, running through my streets doing, you know, some of the things that will go on, I mean, you know, I would be afraid and I would want someone to do something.
R:  Well, [SIGH] yeah, I mean, it's -- like I say, it's very [SIGH], you know, we -- you know, I, like I say, I hate to say, you know, I hate to lump myself in with everybody, you know, because I like always been kind of [NOISE] a firm believer in trying to, you know, you know, form my own opinions.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, but [SIGH] as a Americans we take many things for granted.  We just, I think, you know, don't think there's much to the world besides us.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, and there's so much more going on, I mean, you know, in -- in Afghanistan, I mean, women were being killed for talking to other men --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I mean, women -- you know, lawyers, women that were lawyers, doctors, were not able to -- to do their job.  I mean, that's just -- it's terrible.  I mean, over here we -- we've got so many privileges, you know, and they really are a privilege.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, that we just [NOISE] -- a lot of people just don't get and it's very unfortunate because, you know, [SIGH] around the world so many places don't have the same privileges we do.
L:  Right.  Oh, I totally agree with and I think it's, uh, um, you know, I, uh -- you know, I -- I, yeah, just hope that people do try to [inaudible] it -- it's a good -- the -- the most positive, uh, things to be gained from having a terrible friend, um --
R:  Well --
L:  -- I don't know though.
R:  You know, I mean, I -- I hate to say it, you know, it was a terrible day, you know --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I remember exactly what I was doing --
L:  Really?
R:  -- where I was --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when everything happened.  You know, I mean, uh, you know, to the T, I mean, it's -- it's gonna be, you know, kind of -- you know, I'm -- I'm thirty two it's gonna be kind of our generations Pearl Harbor.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, everybody's gonna remember what happened.  Nobody's gonna remember where it happened, why it happened but hopefully they realize that, you know, you know, they can wake up to say, "Hey, look, you know, you know, this is gonna continually -- continuingly happen unless we change our ways".  You know, and it's -- you know, and -- and, like I say, I'm not saying their ways are bad and I'm not siding with anybody but [SIGH], you know, i- -- like I say, we're -- we're very, like you said, arrogant people.  You know, and that's kinda rules our ways unfortunately.
L:  Mm, well, yeah, I think that, um -- well, it -- it remains to be seen yet.  I think it's a little too early to judge yet.  I -- I think it is very hard when you've been so spoilt not to take it for granted and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and just assume that this is what you deserve and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, I guess that's the peace I -- I ...
