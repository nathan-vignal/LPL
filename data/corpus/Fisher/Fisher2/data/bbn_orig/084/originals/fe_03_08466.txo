L:  [NOISE] Hi. [NOISE] Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Yeah, my name is Richard, I'm in Seattle [NOISE].
R:  I'm Scott in Florida.
L:  [NOISE] Oh cool. [NOISE] You don't have a southern accent.
R:  No, I'm actually from that area, Tacoma --
L:  [NOISE] Seattle.
R:  Tacoma, yeah.
L:  Tacoma, I went to school in Tacoma, Pacific Lutheran.
R:  No kidding, wow.
L:  [NOISE] Well, uh, to be, [NOISE] um, honest, um, m- my life [NOISE] has always been so complicated that, uh, it -- it really hasn't changed me that much.
R:  Yeah, the only thing I can think of is, uh, like, airport security, you know, waiting in lines for stuff.
L:  I'm [SIGH] -- well, even though I get frustrated at the, uh, [NOISE] greatly enhanced security --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I remember that it's, you know, for my good.
R:  Yeah, you gotta do it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- yeah.
L:  [NOISE] And it's made me more organized and, like, [NOISE] travelling I just --
R:  Definitely.
L:  -- I just downsize everything and I've never been an over packer but now I'm just really careful what [NOISE] I carry and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's made me very organized. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I could -- uh, I could agree with that.  I, uh, I recently took a trip --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, uh, I felt sorry for the guys that were working where you had to take your shoes off and [LAUGH] also go through the x ray machine, poor guy.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, I know it.
R:  Oh, stinking.
L:  [NOISE] I know it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] And, um, I, uh -- but like I said it's a hassle but it -- it's one that now kinda of a necessary evil.
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  [NOISE] And so [NOISE] -- but what -- the only time I'm really thinking about it is when I'm picking up, 'cause I live like five minutes from the airport.
R:  Oh really.
L:  Sea Tac.  Yeah, 'cause I live in Burian --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, um, [NOISE] when I have to pick up someone -- it used to be I could circle indefinitely --
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  -- un- until I could find the person I'd just keep circling.  Those days are gone. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, is that right?
L:  [NOISE] At least here, y- you can't circle [NOISE] so --
R:  No kid- --
L:  -- now --
R:  Do they inspect the cars?  They were doing that for awhile, I mean, you know --
L:  Yeah, but [NOISE], I mean, [NOISE] it would be so easy [NOISE] for --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- my -- uh, whoever I'm picking up and me to lose track because, you know, it gets so busy and so hectic [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that I just tell people to walk down to the Denny's and meet me there --
R:  [LAUGH] That's a good idea.
L:  -- because -- and that's the only time I really -- you know, it's sad to say, that's the only time I really think about it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because, [MN] life --
R:  Yeah, I'd have to agree, I mean, it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we're getting kinda used to it now --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and people, uh, talk about, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- especially the Burtianans[?], which I sort of consider myself --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but people that worry about, you know, uh, infringing on rights for --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, basically giving up rights for security --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- I -- I think, you gotta --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- be pragmatic about it and, uh --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you know, live in the situation --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, in general --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I hope we wouldn't be at this stage, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- five, ten years from now, you know, I wouldn't wanna still be --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, uh [LIPSMACK] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- worrying about, you know, is someone spying on me, all the government, that kind of thing.
L:  [NOISE] Boy, I hope you're right.  I couldn't be a pessimist.
R:  [LAUGH] Me too, me too.
L:  [NOISE] I expect --
R:  I have a dim view of --
L:  -- and prepare of the worst --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and hope for the best.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  
L:  But I think with human nature and the complexities of the world [NOISE] I hope you're right but I don't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I just don't know and I hope you're right.  Um, but [NOISE], you know, I think everything has a cost and as I'm not wanting to take my shoes off and not wanting to be, you know, virtually strip searched --
R:  Yeah [MN].
L:  -- [MN] um, I don't want some crazy, you know, up in the air --
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  -- y- you know, trying to do something --
R:  Yeah, and I think it -- it -- just, uh, the sheer fact that they know it would be much harder to do what they did before --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- like any -- any generic terrorist out there, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think that's -- they want it to -- you know, the US government wants that to be the case just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, not that, uh, if you're sneaky you couldn't do it but, uh, just the general --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- hard -- hard -- making the US a hard target, you know, by something really easy, you know.
L:  Yeah, and I think making things difficult -- again, I hop- -- yeah.
R:  Like, uh --
L:  And that's --
R:  -- the, uh --
L:  -- a very good point. [NOISE]
R:  Like, uh, Israel's airline, LL --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- can you imagine they've been in business for quite a while, you know, decades now and, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they've never had an incident really b- but their security -- I mean, you have to, uh, go in there, you know, a couple of weeks before, an hour long interviews, you know [LAUGH] --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- where are you going, what are you doing, that [LAUGH] kinda -- just a real pain but, you know, they live in a police state.  I -- I hope, uh, it never comes down to that for -- for us.
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] That would be horrible.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But we have --
R:  I -- I don't -- you know, business would come to a screeching halt and that's -- that's what drives the US, you know, [LAUGH] it's --
L:  I know.  When I was in, um, college there -- the s- security, I mean, there's no comparison between then and now [NOISE] and, uh, I think we -- we had -- we were spoiled and things were so easy --
R:  Oh yeah --
L:  -- until, you know --
R:  -- that's for certain[?].
L:  -- so, um, uh, 'cause I worked there -- there were not -- there wasn't a lot of fuss about too much but, you know, maybe -- a- again, when I'm in the -- when I'm in the air with a bunch of strangers --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I wanna know that were put through as much hassle as I was --
R:  Yeah, definitely.  And I think people are looking at, uh, each other more so now, you know, if -- if the guy next to you or a couple of seats over --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- starts fiddling around with his shoes you kinda --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, you're more in tune to that than you would have been, I think.  Y- like that guy that tried to, I don't know, had some bomb in his shoes, hence the xraying of shoes.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  You know, [LAUGH] I think -- I bet the -- the, uh, the -- the regular passengers on there probably beat the hell out of that guy, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  I don't -- you know, I just can't see it, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- people -- 'cause I think when it initially --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- happened people were like, "Well, maybe they'll just take us down to Cuba or something".
L:  [NOISE]
R:  They just kinda let it go.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they didn't really put up much resistance.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I can't ever see that happening again, you know.
L:  [NOISE] And then [SIGH], um, coming very soon pilots are gonna be packing.
R:  Yeah, that's right.
L:  You know, they're gonna be --
R:  And, uh, the arm --
L:  -- armed.
R:  -- the arm or the, uh, reinforced cockpit doors so if they lock it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean, it's locked.
L:  That's a good thing.
R:  Yeah.  That's definitely a good thing.  And those air marshals, you never -- you never know who they are but, uh --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- probably somebody in an aisle seat [MN] in the back.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But --
L:  But I don't know if I want my pilot packing.
R:  Oh, is that right?  Yeah, I can't imagine --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean, I can't imagine the scenario that they would actually use that and I'm sure some --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, redneck will, uh [LAUGH] pilot will do that some day.
L:  Oh yeah, my roommate thinks it's just great.
R:  Yeah [inaudible].
L:  [NOISE] That -- that -- that pilots are packing some day soon.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I'm -- I'm not, uh, I'm pretty neutral on the gun issue --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm -- I'm not a -- a gun nut like most of the folks in the south here --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or -- or, you know, in the north west --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm sure that, you know, they -- even though there are the remnants of hunters, uh, for the most part I'd say everybody up there is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- anti gun, anti -- you know [LAUGH] --
L:  You know, unless you're, uh, some indigenous tribe I h- I believe in very strict gun control.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [NOISE] And so the idea of having my [LAUGH] pilot and co pilot --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  -- you know, Wyatt Earp up there --
R:  I know, I know.
L:  -- that's just a little too much for me but, you know, i- it's all coming to that and I can see -- I can see why people would want it and I can see why some people would really, really advocate it and not even, you know, like my redneck roommate but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, just sensible people [NOISE] being made nuts.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I can -- I can see it, I -- that's -- you know, maybe, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] I don't know, some kind of gun that, you know, a shot like the -- the police --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, SWAT guys that, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they shoot like bean bags or something non lethal.
L:  You want to be maced? [LAUGH]
R:  What's that?
L:  Yo- you want the pilot to be able to -- you know, what these -- these --
R:  Oh, not mace, I don't want that but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, bean bags or something like that --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Rubber bullets, something [LAUGH].  Something that can't penetrate the plane 'cause, I mean, can you imagine depressurizing at --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- thirty thousand feet to --
L:  [LAUGH] Oh my -- I mean, I don't wanna be worried -- I mean, there's enough to worry about up there --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- now with -- is the- there -- but I just see life getting so complicated and so much pressure that I just see things gradually getting more and more [MN] -- just more and more of the same.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
L:  More lines, more security --
R:  Yeah, unfortunately I think that's, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the road we're in for, uh [NOISE], probably most of my life, I mean, [LAUGH] I'm a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'm thirty three and I don't see that going away in the next twenty or thirty years so --
L:  [NOISE] Got ya.  And n- no, I don't think so.
R:  I -- I -- and it's not just, uh -- they may relax things here and there but the overall structure -- you know, they'll be --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- a- able to implement something at a -- at a moment's notice and --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- you know, like that stupid color coded, uh, security thing we've got that nobody really understands, are we in orange or yellow today, what's that mean, you know?
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  [LAUGH] That's just kind of a ridiculous thing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but I -- you know, the -- the people that, uh, law --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- enforcement folks, that actually means something --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- to them, you know.  And different -- they do different things so it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- interesting, I don't know.  As far as, uh, I don't know I keep trying to think, like, in schools --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  -- I mean, they're already [LAUGH] -- they're already, uh -- some of 'em are pr- --
