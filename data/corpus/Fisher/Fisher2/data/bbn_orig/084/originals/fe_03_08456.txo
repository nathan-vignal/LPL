L:  Hello.
R:  Yes, how you doing?
L:  Hi, I am Seth.
R:  My name's Mike.
L:  Nice to meet you [NOISE].
R:  You too.  Where you from?
L:  Uh, New York, New York.
R:  I talked to a guy last night from New York City, I think, so I live in Michigan myself so ...
L:  Wow, the other guy I talked to last night was also from New York.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I talked to someone named Eric last night and we talked about health and fitness or something like that.
L:  Yeah, yeah, health and fitness was last night.  I guess it's the same topic every night.
R:  Yeah, so ...
L:  Today's September eleventh, oi. [NOISE]
R:  Have you made any changes or not in your lifestyle?
L:  No, no, I have not made a single change.  I slept through it.  I was here I was -- I mean, uh, my roommate tried to wake me up and I threw a pillow at him [NOISE] I was like, "Why are you waking me up?  It's nine AM I'm going to sleep" and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so he left I had no idea why but he got a call 'cause he was working for a [NOISE] Prague -- he -- he was from Prague.  He was working for a newspaper there and they called --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- at li- like at nine AM and were like, "Get down to the World Trade Center someone just flew a plane into it".  I don't know he was turning on my TV, I was like, "What the hell are you doing?" He was like, "A plane just went to the World Trade Center" and I was just like, "I don't care".
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  But, uh -- yeah, but then there was smoke everywhere.
R:  How close were you to that place by chance?
L:  Um, I was --
R:  Pretty far away or not?
L:  -- right out in Bleaker Street.  Actually, I was right on the -- they cut it off in Halston, I was the street north of the cut off from were they stopped letting people go --
R:  Oh really?
L:  -- and they evacuated people from.  So, I didn't --
R:  So, you were pretty close --
L:  -- have evacuate.
R:  -- then, huh.
L:  But I could see it all from the window.
R:  Wow, that's pretty wild.
L:  It was -- but if I'd looked but I -- I was sleeping.  But I -- there was lots and lots and lots of smoke [NOISE] from where the towers used to be and I didn't get any TV and the cable guy was supposed to come at noon and that's the only reason I was waking up and the cable guy didn't show up [LAUGH] and I was all like, "Why isn't the cable guy coming?" and then --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I tried to call him and the phone wasn't working --
R:  Uh.
L:  -- and I was like, "Wait a minute, this isn't good, nothing seems to be working" [NOISE] so I turned on the TV and I'm like, "Wait a minute I don't get any channels any more except channel two"
R:  Oh.
L:  And I'm like, "Okay, this is actually kind of a big deal".  But then the -- the landline was -- started working it's a -- it was the cellphone didn't work.
R:  Oh.
L:  And so I couldn't make any long distances calls and I had to, uh -- oh, 'cause I had AOL, right, so I dialed up through AOL and I found, like, one of my friends online in Boston and it was like, "Does your phone work?" and he's like, "Yeah" 'cause, like, I had him call my parents just so they knew I was, you know, alive.
R:  Was okay, oh yeah.
L:  Yeah, and so --
R:  Yeah, I couldn't believe it I, uh, I went in the office that morning and they had it on TV just as it was happening, I guess, and when I first seen it looked just like a little commuter plane, I didn't realize --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, the angle they showed it on at first that it was actually, like, a big, uh, seven three seven or whatever it was.  It didn't look that big the first time.  And then I left there and then I -- they're -- I had the radio station on and they were talking, "Oh, another one just crashed in too" and about a mile down the road, "Oh, they just hit the Pentagon" I'm thinking, "Holy Christ, what the hell is going on" you know.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And I ended up --
L:  Crazy.
R:  -- glued to the TV set for two three days afterwards checking everything out but --
L:  Well, see --
R:  -- I didn't really --
L:  -- you had channels. [MN]
R:  But I haven't made any changes in my life.  I go to Canada once in a while I live maybe an hour and a half from, uh, Windsor, Ontario.  The only problem it created is it's -- it's a pain in the ass trying -- well, it was last year, trying to get back and forth across the border there.  They had army guys there searching everything in your car and the funny thing was they had them on the opposite side of the tunnel.  They let you drive into the tunnel, 'cause we've got a bridge going across from Detroit to Windsor, you go across the bridge --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if you wanna come back you go underneath, uh, a tunnel under the river.  And they go into the damn tunnel but then they search the vehicle on the way -- after you come through the tunnel.  I mean, that's kinda stupid, if they're afraid you're gonna blow the damn tunnel up --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- don't you'd think they'd on both sides checking to make sure.
L:  That makes more sense --
R:  You don't have any --
L:  -- to check it before you go in the tunnel.
R:  Right, 'cause if they're afraid someone's going to blow the damn tunnel up, you know, it's kinda after the fact to check you after you get through the damn thing but they always -- they always had 'em on the opposite side for some reason.  I could never figure that one out but they're just -- they just rip your shit all apart and then get out of here and stuff, you know, and they aren't the friendliness of people.  I guess they have a job to do but, uh --
L:  That's crazy but there were military officers in the subway here for quite some time, it really pissed me off.  I just didn't see the need for them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they're wearing these stupid camouflage uniforms and you're like --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- "Dude, you're not camouflaging there's tiles behind you.  You're in a subway --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- you don't need to -- to wear your camouflage".
R:  Maybe it was just to let people know they were there and so they wouldn't --
L:  I guess with their --
R:  -- be like a deterrent or something.
L:  -- big ass guns.  And --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they shut the subway down the other day 'cause someone left an envelope of white powder --
R:  Oh jeeze.
L:  -- which turned out to be like baby powder [LAUGH].
R:  Why do people got to be a holes about stuff like that.  They're so retarded, man, I tell ya.
L:  It was like --
R:  Every time you see the --
L:  -- this trick, like someone purposely left powder in the subway just to -- to play a joke.
R:  Well, they all those s- scares with the Anthrax --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- before, people have mailed stuff to people and I don't understand how you get your rocks off doing something like that it's kinda --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- kinda dumb if you ask me, man, you know.
L:  I find it hilarious that someone managed to shut down the subway just for leaving some baby powder in it.
R:  Yeah, the only thing is if they get caught they're probably gonna go to jail for a while over it and it's just kinda stupid to, uh -- I mean, I've got better things to do with my life than do stuff like --
L:  Well, it's not like you can get caught for that, I'm sure.
R:  Oh, well you'd be surprised.  Like all those hoaxes, I think, there's a lot of that crap going on before and, uh, they don't take too kindly to that so -- but, um --
L:  There was another hoax the other day that some, like, Arab guy asked this guy to drive this -- he pointed to a car and said, "I'll give you two thousand dollars if you drive that car over the Brooklyn Bridge". [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, Jesus.
L:  And then the guy reported it to the police but the Middle Eastern guy, like, totally disappeared and it turned out that the car he pointed, like, belonged to a reporter who was just in the courthouse.  It was just like some random car and he didn't even --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- have the keys he was just joking around.
R:  Oh, that's kind of [inaudible], especially after what happened people panic so damn easily --
L:  I think it's kind of crazy. 
R:  -- you know, I mean --
L:  I mean, I don't -- I'm not really worried personally --
R:  The only thing that ticked me off was we've flown to -- uh, gone to Mexico a cou- well, actually three or four times since then, we've been on vacation on the Cancun and stuff and going through the airports is a major pain in the ass.  I got a knee brace that works so both my knees are -- are gone, I've got to get 'em replaced and it was [inaudible] I had to take it off and he searched all through and everything and taking your shoes off, you know, it's kind of --
L:  Oh, I hate that.
R:  -- a pain in the rear end.
L:  I hate taking my shoes off.
R:  You know, and, uh, they just get a little carried away.  I guess it's for your own good, I guess, but, I mean, I -- I always figure what's gonna happen is gonna happen and if I'm gonna die it's -- I'm gonna die in an airplane 'cause that's my time to go --
L:  I totally agree.
R:  -- uh, whether -- whether I'm on an airplane or sitting in the chair in my backyard and have a heart attack and drop.  I mean, when you're time's up it's up, I really -- I mean, that's the way I look at life, you know, it doesn't matter what you're doing or where you're at so, I mean, uh, I really don't --
L:  I just don't think they're gonna go for the planes again.  I think it's --
R:  No.
L:  -- they -- they're gonna come up with something much more creative and clever that's different.
R:  I -- yeah, they're out there.  They're -- they're plotting something I'm sure of it, you know, I -- I'm surprised -- I always cringe every time they have, like, a major sporting event or something like that, you know, two hundred thousand people at a mass [inaudible] or at the Super Bowl or, you know, and somebody doing something like that down in one of them places and, uh, I'm sure they're just not going to blow off and let it go on.  I'm sure there's somewhere a mastermind, some kind of a, you know, attack somewhere or there'll be a lot of small ones, you know, to create panic across the US or -- for all we know they may hit somewhere in every state just to, you know, to get people on the move again so it's hard to say.
L:  I mean --
R:  But I definitely think it's not over yet so, unfortunately -- I don't know why the -- we just can't along in the world, I mean, come on.
L:  I don- I don't think it's over but I don't think there's anything we can do to stop it.  And I think they're --
R:  Well, they -- they --
L:  -- wasting a lot of money for --
R:  -- had info on the last one, I guess -- you know, it comes out afterwards that they knew something was going on but there was no specific details so, I mean, what you're actually -- I guess they do a lot of monitoring of phone calls and stuff or -- you know, emails or something they can track stuff now, I guess, and, you know, they always had those [inaudible] raised, "We don't have anything specific but we heard there may be something going on" well, you know, there's a lot of ground cover, you know, from one side of the world to the other.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, you really don't know where they're gonna be.
L:  They can't really pinpoint it.  I heard there was something going on here.
R:  Yeah.  But that's -- I mean, every time they raise those levels to orange or whatever it was, you know, we don't have any sp- specific details but there's this chatter going on that something may happen, you know, uh [NOISE], that kinda narrows it down, doesn't it? [LAUGH] I mean, come on.  But, uh, you know, if they're gonna do it, they're gonna do it and it's just too bad the innocent people have to die is all, I mean, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, young people died in the World Trade Center from how many different countries.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, if they had a beef, I guess, fine and dandy but, I mean, they took out people from I -- I don't remember what the total number of different country was -- fifty, a hundred different countries people were working at in that building and it just, um, to me it just sounds [inaudible], man, I don't know.
L:  I know.  A- attacking the Pentagon is one thing but the World Trade Center is just too public.
R:  Yeah, I don't know, actually, I don't -- you know, I just don't understand why everybody can't just get along, I mean, you know, the world's big enough for everybody but everybody's got to have this and that but I definitely agree with -- I don't know how you felt on the war but I think it's time to get him out of -- of like rickles to Islam.
L:  I thought the war was pretty -- uh, it was just the Bush administration trying to --
R:  Uh, well, maybe he was --
L:  -- put up a [inaudible] of, "Look, we haven't found Bin Laden, oops, let's go after Saddam Hussein and get the entire country behind this so that no one notices that we've given up on Bin Laden".
R:  Yeah, well, I --
L:  And, uh, "Oh, look, we're gonna go and -- and take all the oil for ourselves so that, you know, republicans have lots of money and the rest of you --"
R:  Well, that doesn't help me any here because I'm still paying a buck sixty, a buck seventy gallon for gasoline, I don't know what you guys are paying in New York for it but --
L:  Oh, I don't -- I don't have a car so it don't matter.
R:  Okay, I see, we're up to, uh, we -- we've been as high as two dollars a gallon here.
L:  I know, it didn't do any good.  I was looking around the prices, crazy.
R:  But it's weird because my -- my wife's [inaudible] down to North Carolina a couple of months ago and down in -- in that area it was only a dollar twenty something a gallon, we're paying a buck sixty, a buck seventy up here.  It's like every other week it goes up.
L:  I think it's like --
R:  It go up twenty cents --
L:  -- two dollars something here in the city.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Yeah, it's crazy.
R:  Well, I thought when I seen that they said Iraq was going to start exporting oil again they -- well I guess we'll only get, like, three or eight percent of our -- you know, export comes from Iraq but I thought --
