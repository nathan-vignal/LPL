R:  Karen.
L:  Hi, my name's Betsy.
R:  Betsy, where are you from?
L:  Oh, I'm from Maine.
R:  Oh, [MN] I'm in Kentucky.
L:  Oh, my heavens [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, god.
R:  I'm sorry, I'm gonna turn off -- my TV off here [SIGH].  Oh, maybe I can turn it -- there we go [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, great.
R:  I couldn't hear anything.
L:  Oh, now I can hear you [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] I'm sorry, I was talking on two different phones at the same time when they ... [inaudible] [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, that's weird.
R:  [LAUGH] I heard prof- ... that's all I heard [NOISE].
L:  Um, you're breaking up something terrible.
R:  Okay, let -- let me listen -- hang on a minute, hang on. 
L:  Okay.
R:  [NOISE] Is that better?
L:  Oh, a lot clearer.
R:  [NOISE] Okay, good [MN], I live out in the country and I don't have many towers out here -- okay, there we go -- are we better now?
L:  Oh, even better.
R:  Okay, good [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Where I live I don't have any towers anywhere close to me, so, in order to talk on my phone I have to find certain places to go -- [SIGH] [MN].
L:  Oh, I -- I have one room upstairs that I use my cellphone in.
R:  [LAUGH] You can appreciate it then [LAUGH].
L:  Oh yeah, I'm in a rural area too.
R:  [LAUGH] I love it.  I did not hear the -- all of the [SIGH] -- what's the, ah -- ah, the question of the day?  All I heard was professional athletes [LAUGH].
L:  I heard about two thirds of it -- I heard --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- how do you feel about -- it sounded like professional athletes striking, and then --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- it said, how -- ah, do you think their salaries are too high --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or, do you think they're worth the money they're paid --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah --
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH]
L:  -- then something else was garbled.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH] And I'm on a normal phone.
R:  Oh, goodness [LAUGH] -- I don't feel so bad then [NOISE].
L:  Ah, [MN] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'll start off I guess, since I imagine they'll want to hear something [LAUGH] --
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  -- um, basically, I think they're grotesquely overpaid.
R:  Yes, I definitely agree [SIGH].  [NOISE]
L:  Um [MN] -- people teaching schools don't make in a year what these people make in a day.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  And, doctors don't make that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- people who really contribute to society, and then you have someone who's basically an overgrown child whacking a ball around --
R:  [LAUGH] I'd have to totally agree with everything you're saying [MN].
L:  [LAUGH] And it -- it's weird around here -- it isn't a male female thing -- my husband just goes wild about their salaries, ah, I believe the last one he heard he said, "For that price, the guy should clean the stadium, too".
R:  [LAUGH] Well, you know, I -- I think about this, that [NOISE] these guys get paid all this money, all they've done is just played a sport, it's not like they have a [SIGH] -- something that use their mind for, which --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's what we try to te- teach our kids -- go to school, get an education, you know, go to college, get a good job, but yet, [MN] -- actually in the back of their minds, just going  "Why should I?  When I can play sports and make as much money as these guys", and that, if they're hurt or injured, [MN] they can still -- they still make a lot of money, no matter how you look at it, if they're hurt or injured [NOISE] --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- which is -- which is really frustrating on -- on the thing of trying to raise a child in this society, saying, "Oh, but, you need to go to school" [LAUGH].
L:  [MN] I'm -- I'm sure that would be ter- -- I don't have any children, but --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- I could picture -- how do you explain to a kid how important education is, and they need to be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in studying --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when they see some guys playing baseball, being a millionaire and acting like a total lout.
R:  Exactly, and the kids look up to 'em, that's the most frustrating part, and these are people that, [SIGH] could care less essentially, most of the time, on how they're perceived in society, yet society is what's paying their income because they're willing to go and see them play, so they're +putting -- putting the money up to pay their -- their salary, but yet they don't care how they're perceived by the public, or -- or by children, and that's who primarily looks up to them, is the children.
L:  Oh, I know. 
R:  [NOISE] And it, you know --
L:  There's a lot of guys who think they're twelve years old.
R:  Oh, yeah.  [MN] And -- I -- I -- I -- I completely feel that they are way overpaid, this is just [MN] -- [SIGH] I mean, something about -- there was a -- a guy in high school [SIGH], that's a senior in high school this year --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- am I correct in this?  And they've offered him something like, forty five million dollars, or something?
L:  A high school student?
R:  Straight out of high school -- he's not going to college at all.
L:  Oh, that's ridiculous.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, so w- -- what does this set up for the kids that are behind him [SIGH] to get an education?  There -- there's no --
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  Well, there -- there -- there should be an age limit, there should be a cap on salaries, ah, you know [MN] -- I'm sorry, they're playing sport [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, it isn't anything that's going to change the universe -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's not making anyone's life better --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- other than theirs --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's really not doing anything productive.
R:  No.
L:  And, then you see the people working in the stadiums who don't even make enough money to live on.
R:  Right, they're getting paid minimum wage to work in the stadium, and they're probably going through school, trying to better themselves, if they can on the salary they're making --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [MN] 'cause a lot of [several inaudible words] we have a -- a ball stadium here that, um, the kids in college work at the ball st- stadium, to earn the money --
L:  Right.
R:  -- during summer, 'cause that's primarily ours, is spring and summer, and -- and that's how they make their money so they can go to school, but yet, then they've got the people out in the field making a bunch of money, that --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- so, yeah, I -- I --
L:  And then, you know, don't forget all these places that the taxpayers pay for the stadium.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH] --
L:  And --
R:  -- that was a big thing here about a year ago [LAUGH] -- why do you want to build a --
L:  That's funny.
R:  -- new stadium?
L:  That should go to the schools, it should go to homeless children, it should go to education for people who can't play sports.
R:  Yes.
L:  But no way should a city or state be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- basically providing the stadiums for the business owner --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- so that he can pay more money to the athletes.
R:  No, that -- it's -- if they're going to build a stadium, it needs to be built by the owners, they need to -- to pay for it out of whatever they charge -- there should be nothing from -- the community should not have to pay for that stadium, because they're already paying the salaries of all these people as it is [SIGH], by them attending the games.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  And, if that -- that much money's being paid to these, um, [MN] athletes -- and I'm not even gonna call 'em professional, they're just athletes [MN], then some of it should be taken back and paid towards the stadium instead of -- 'cause the stadiums are -- is what houses the people that come see 'em [NOISE].
L:  Exactly.
R:  So, you know, it kind of doesn't make sense to me, if you're gonna have these people come -- spend all this money to come see somebody, and make 'em comfortable and a nice place for them [SIGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] Instead of making it all nice for the -- for the athletes [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, give the athletes a wooden bench, no hair conditioning ...
R:  [LAUGH] I like your thinking.
L:  [MN]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, make them think at least it's a little work involved here.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They talk about, "Oh, it's so much work to train and to practice, and ..." --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's like, you're trying to tell some twelve year old kid it's work to go play baseball everyday --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they'll laugh at you.
R:  It -- then to look at the doctors and if I were to put limitations on how many hours they can work in a week, you know, [SIGH] but, they're -- they're getting paid [MN], actually, about ten dollars an hour when they're first starting out, but yet they're putting in hundreds of hours a week.
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  It -- but that -- but they're doing something, they're -- they're contributing back to society [SIGH], and you look at the -- it -- the athletes, yeah, this is hard work, yeah it is. [SIGH] Yeah, you're standing on manicured lawn --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- with [MN] everything paid for [LAUGH], yeah, that's hard work, isn't it?  [LAUGH] 
L:  I would just love, for one month, people to say, "Your salaries are ridiculous, we're not going to the game".
R:  Yes.
L:  And, if -- even just one week, nobody went to a single game in protest, they might start rethinking some of the salary structures.
R:  Yes.  Definitely [MN] and it's actually kinda funny, 'cause a lot of times the corporate -- where they've bought the corporate suites and so forth -- the amount of money that each corporation puts into going to a game -- it's phenomenal, and they only might have ten or twelve people go to a game, but yet the amount of money they had to put out -- just to go to those games, well, a percentage of that still went to the players' salaries [SIGH].
L:  [MN] That -- you wonder how many people got laid off so that the corporation could have the expensive box --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- to pay the salaries of overpaid players.
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] That -- that's a heck of a trade in [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But yes, I -- I totally agree, that, ah, there should be caps on the salaries, I think they should figure out a way that, um, these people are paid a normal wage for what they do, ah, [MN] a million dollars a year -- that might be an okay salary for somebody, but they need to also have guidelines, that they be penalized if they do certain things [MN] ...
