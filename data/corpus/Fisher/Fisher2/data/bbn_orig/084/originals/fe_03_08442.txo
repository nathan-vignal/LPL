R:  Hi, I'm Tammy.
L:  I'm Cathy.
R:  Hi Cathy.  Um, okay, I -- I guess I'll start -- is that all right?
L:  Okay, because I've never done this before.
R:  [LAUGH] Okay, this is actually my second time doing this --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- um, so it's -- it's not too bad.  Um, all right, well, the topic is September eleventh --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, um, I can say that, um, it definitely affected my life, because um, I'm a police officer and I was in the police academy, um, on September eleventh, and we were in the middle of training, and um, [MN] we thought it was part of a drill -- we didn't think that it was real, and, um, after a few minutes when we realized that it was real, um, basically we ran outside, and ah, we ah, ended up in total chaos, um, I'm an EMT and I got pulled back to my department, along with everybody else, and ah, we didn't know what was going to happen -- I remember we thought we were going to go to New York, and, um, we were told not to go, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that there was no reason, um, one of the girls in my class lost her father, and she, ah, never found him -- they never recovered anything --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] um, they, ah -- basically, they let us out of the academy, like, two weeks early because they needed us, um, New Jersey went into a state of emergency, and I ended up having to keep a suitcase packed, because we never knew what was going to happen --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I mean, we didn't know if we were going to get called in the middle of the night, to you know, go out somewhere, so, ah, that's -- I can say it definitely affected my life, probably a little bit for the worse, I mean, I think that I'm definitely a lot more cautious that I was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think I was definitely more free spirited before this happened --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and now I think I've kind of become like more [NOISE] of a survivalist --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, how about you?  What do you think?
L:  [MN] Well, I, myself, we were watching ah, the news --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and it came on and said that there was, ah, there was a problem -- a fire in one of the towers, and then of course by the time the news cameras turned on it, then we -- we saw the other plane go in, and by that time there was already talk of a first plane going in, so it was really weird because you were almost watching it instantaneously, and you know, we did see it actually happen --
R: Uh-huh.
L:  -- and ah, as far as personally -- we run a campground in Florida -- it didn't affect our personal lives any --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but, it made us hold our family a little closer, and realise that we're a vacation capital of the world and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so, it kinda makes you a little bit nervous, but, then --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we got backlash from it, because my son, even though -- I'm Presbyterian, and our family is Presbyterian, my son, who is a deputy with the Sheriff here --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- he was, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- he was Muslim --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and ah, people here began to look differently at him, as if -- as if he was in on planning it.
R:  Sure, yeah.
L:  And, ah, you know, it was so strange because it -- it isn't that the Muslim faith --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- did this, it was, you know, +factions [MN] -- people want to lump people in categories --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that was -- that was where I [MN] was upset with --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that ah, that just because a person happens to be Muslim doesn't mean that they're terrorists --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it doesn't mean that the Muslim church agrees with what went on, you know, of -- we had ah, several people here that were --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, involved in it, and I work with scouts and one of my, ah, people that I was going -- taking through a wood badge, and was a councilor for him -- he was a -- he was a, ah, police officer from --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, the east coast of Florida that was brought in on the investigation --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and so, then we started getting a little bit closer connections to, you know, what went on -- we were very fortunate to -- not to lose anyone that we knew of in the -- in the disaster, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it ah, it definitely made people closer --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and um -- and I know that our winter visitors, um, they -- they didn't seem to have any reaction much from it --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but, other than the fact that they questioned whether Central Florida could be a target because of the international, ah, trade and -- and um, tourism here.
R:  Sure [NOISE].
L:  So, they seemed to not attend, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- functions that -- they weren't big attenders --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- at Disney, or some of the other areas --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- but most of our people are snowbirds and -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so, they don't really go to those events, in those areas --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- too much anyways.
R:  [NOISE] Right, right.
L:  But, ah, [MN] it -- 
R:  I -- yeah [NOISE].
L:  -- it showed you how things could turn around in a second.
R:  Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
L:  And -- and how what you think is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is, safe --
R:  Safe and --
L:  -- and secure, isn't.
R:  Yeah, [NOISE] yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  I --
L:  -- one of the poignant things --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that -- that I watched -- I was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I was devastated seeing the one gentleman --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- who was a president of the company who was late because he was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- there for his, ah, son's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- first day at kindergarten --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and they were interviewing him --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- on camera, and on camera it hit him --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that he lost everybody.
R:  Everybody was gone, yeah.
L:  And -- and it just hit him, how many children --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- were left fatherless --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- or motherless -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and he literally fell apart in front of the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the television announcers and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I -- I just --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- there's no way I can -- I can even fathom the depth of his agony at that particular moment.
R: No.
L:  And -- and so, but, you know, we were just glued to the TV for days --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, praying that they were gonna find people, and things like that -- it was ...
R: Yeah, I -- I think, well, we're from New Jersey, and I -- I think being from New Jersey or New York, ah, the surrounding areas -- because so many people died, everybody knew somebody, or knew somebody who knew somebody --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- who was in the World Trade Centre.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, [MN] like, I could think of two people that, actually three people that, you know, we sort of knew by association --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, because [MN] it was so close to home [MN] I think that -- I think for New Jersey and New York, um, it's gonna be a long, long time before people start to loosen up around here --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, we're a little bit uptight anyway, up north, and I think that the rest of the country seems to be -- I'm not going to say forgetting it, but sort of moving past it a little --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I -- I think that it's gonna be hard for like, the northeast to really get past it for a long, long time to come.
L:  Right.
R:  I think it's still, like, too fresh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, you know, I -- I really think that there's, like, much more of an effort on security, I mean, I can remember when, you know, if you wanted to sell a book online you could just like drop it in the mailbox, you know, now, anything has to be, you know, dropped off at the Post Office -- you actually have to give it to a person, you have to explain what it is, I mean --
L: Yeah.
R:  -- you know, it's -- there -- it's a lot of changes, you know?
L: Yeah.
R:  So, ah, I think that we're definitely more safety security conscious, um, you know, and obviously, I mean, that's good, but -- I -- I have to agree with what you said that, you know, unfortunately there's always going to be people that'll say, "Well, let's blame an entire race, or an entire religion" --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, and let's put all the blame on them, and we really can't do that.
L:  Right.
R:  So ... 
L:  And --
R:  -- you know.
L:  -- and I, myself, you know, hate to see that happen, because I was part of a discrimination thing here when we first, ah -- my husband was a coastguard, um, retiree when we retired and moved here, I was the first woman in boy scouting --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so, I was lumped, all women, you know? 
R:  Right.
L:  And, um, of course being in the military, trying to get some of the people to be active in the -- the wives associations and things, we found that people stayed away for fear of -- of discrimination --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and we fought discrimination, ah, you know, a lot, and then -- and then to have my son, who for some reason has, because of a friend, entered into the Muslim faith to -- to think that people think that he had a hand in -- in this, strictly because of a religion --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it -- that was -- that was devastating.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And ah, but, you know, ah, we had one lady here, you know, she said, "Well, you know, what are we going to do?  You know, when they raise the level of security awareness --"
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you know, lately, they ask here at the campground, "Well, what -- what is the campground doing to protect us in case, you know, they, you know, tamper with the water system, or this or that?", you know, and -- and we -- we out and out told 'em, you know, there's really no way we can protect ourselves from that.
R:  Right, you just have to take it one day at time and you can't live in fear.
L:  You know, we have -- we have a gated community, nobody comes in unless they're a paid, ah, guest --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so -- and we have a well -- if they -- if they do something ...
