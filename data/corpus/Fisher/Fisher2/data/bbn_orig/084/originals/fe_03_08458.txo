L:  Hi, how are you?   My name is Kelly.
R:  Hi, my name is Maureen.
L:  [NOISE] So, what are we gonna talk about now?  September eleven?
R:  Gee, I'm trying to have [several inaudible words].
L:  I think it was like, what changes have you made from September eleven?
R:  Yeah, um ...
L:  What changes have you made?  [NOISE]
R:  I appreciate the time now I spend with my daughter, and try to spend as much time with family as possible.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  Um, what -- what changes have you made, or ...?
L:  Um, well, actually to -- to be quite honest, I'm back to normal -- at first, um, you know, you're more careful, and you're more afraid to fly ...
R:  Oh, definitely [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, so at first, you know, I -- [MN] it was quite [inaudible] different [NOISE], whereby now I guess everything is back to normal.
R:  Yes.
L:  And um, you know, I'm not really scared anymore.
R:  Yes, I think I was scared probably for the first year --
L:  Yeah, me, I was the same, uh-huh --
R:  Yeah, um ...
L:  And, um, do you think there might [MN] still be more attacks, or do you think it's kinda over?  Can you hold on [inaudible] -- can you have --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- [several inaudible words] -- Hello?
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah [NOISE] ...
R:  Oh, I'm not quite sure, I kinda would hate --
L:  Thank you.
R:  -- to let my guard down and have something happen, so, I think there's a possibility that something could happen again, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't know, you just don't know where to look for it, or what to watch out for.
L:  [NOISE] Okay.
R:  So ... so, I'm kinda more aware of my surroundings and what I'm doing, and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- ah, this is my second phone call, so I'm kinda [LAUGH] ...
L:  Oh, where do you -- where do you live?  Do you live close to New York City?
R:  I'm in Michigan.
L:  Oh, okay, so you're probably not as much in danger.
R:  Yeah, yeah, that's ...
L:  [MN]
R:  -- probably pretty scary for the people right in New York, and [several inaudible words] --
L:  Yeah, yeah, that's what I would think, too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, [NOISE] are you afraid of -- you know, like they have [inaudible], and -- are you afraid of any of that? [NOISE]
R:  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  --  no, I'm not exactly sure what it is, so I [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, you're not? [NOISE] 
R:  No.  I'm not really aware of what it is [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh [NOISE] -- then, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- well, it's like, terrorists, um, -- [MN] kind of like spreading bacteria, like in the water, or on the air, so that everybody will get sick.
R:  Oh, yeah [NOISE] -- I see that babe -- go play.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know -- 
L:  And --
R:  -- I was very careful with the mail, after that anthrax thing.
L:  Okay [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah, [inaudible] --
L:  -- and have you been to New York, ever since that happened?
R:  No, never been.
L:  Oh, never?
R:  [inaudible] never [LAUGH] -- have you been there?
L:  Mhm, I lived there for four months.
R:  Oh wow, so, you're familiar with it.
L:  Yeah, I lived it, uh-huh.
R:  Wow, no, I've --
L:  Um --
R:  -- never been there, only seen it on TV [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, well, I went there, um -- I went there, um, once or twice after the attacks, like four weeks after [NOISE] ...
R:  Oh, did you see the Trade Centers?  [inaudible] --
L:  Yeah, I did --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and it was still smoking and burning.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, wow.  [NOISE] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Wow, I kinda wish I would of seen it before that -- it -- it happened.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's like part of history now, and I just never seen it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [inaudible].
L:  And, um, were you, um [NOISE] -- were you, um -- were you -- like, do you live in a small town in Michigan, or a large?  [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, a small town.
L:  A small town -- so you're probably not in danger.
R:  No, I kinda have got a military base --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- by me, so I'm kinda -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that makes me more comfortable, knowing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't know -- there's a training base by me --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but ...
L:  How does your family feel about it?
R:  I have no idea, we never really talked about it.
L:  Oh, no?
R:  No, they were just -- mainly concerned about anyone who was flying and other than that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- no one's really talked about it.
L:  Mhm, hm.
R:  But, I remember when it happened --
L:  Nobody talked about it, huh?
R:  Yeah, yeah, when that happened at the time I lived in the country, and I was so scared because I was surrounded by like, forty acres of farm fields --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that was in the middle of nowhere, so I -- I was always, ah, afraid that someone might be hiding out back, so I started locking my doors all the time after that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Kinda ... that sure made me think though, after that happened -- still can't believe something like that could of happened [MN] ...
L:  That -- finish your first -- that's -- finish your first [several inaudible words] -- and, um, what about your children?
R:  Oh, my daughter was almost one year old at the time --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- after that happened, my daughter stayed home whenever I had to go out grocery shopping I wouldn't take her, you know, into public places, like, stores and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- stuff like that for a few months, 'cause I -- you know, after all those threats of more attacks, I wasn't quite sure --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- where it would happen at, so ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  I was very paranoid, so --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- so, how did you take it?
L:  Um, I don't -- I was a little scared to go into, like -- 'cause, at this time I was living in Chicago, so I was a little afraid, of, you know, entering large buildings, like, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like the Court, or the City Hall, or something like that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so I was a little scared of that, but other than that, I think I took it pretty well -- I wasn't in shock -- well, I knew things were gonna go on and ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  My mom was more concerned about me -- is when I kept going to New York frequently -- she was like, "Don't go it's dangerous, don't go".
R:  Yeah, yeah, I would have been afraid to go to the [inaudible] --
L:  [LAUGH] But I, you know, I didn't really bother that much -- a little bit --
R:  [MN]
L:  But, um ...
R:  Yeah, I have some friends that live in the [MN] New York and Philly area and I know they took it very hard -- it was like, really personal to 'em --
L:  [several inaudible words] if [inaudible] -- if they attacked, um, a city I'm sure that they would actually target New York again -- I don't think anybody would target Chicago, really -- 'cause there's not kind of a landmark.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I often don't think that, um, they would target LA because it's too -- it's just too widespread.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] And so, I think if they attacked something again, it'd be New York again -- maybe the subway system or something, so, not be- -- not being in New York kinda like made me feel on the safe side a little bit.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But people in New York actually took it pretty well -- [MN] they ah, I was really surprised, 'cause um, I [MN] -- I had friends there and I went there four weeks after the attacks, and [MN] they -- they were really brave.
R:  Yeah, it seems like the friends I knew -- they were -- well, of course everyone was kinda mad and angry about that happening, but it seemed like my friends that lived near there -- it was like they took it more personal, there was just ... I don't know.
L:  [NOISE] Oh yeah, they -- they felt more --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it was more personal?
R:  Yeah, I don't know, kinda how to describe it, but ...
L:  True.
R:  It was like, their home that got hit --
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] And, um, how do you think the government responded to it?  Do you feel that they did, you know, the proper -- 
R:  I -- 
L:  -- proper steps -- they took the proper steps?
R:  I think they could have did more than what they've done.
L:  They could have done more?
R:  Yeah, I -- I think so, [inaudible] --
L:  As far as what?
R:  I -- [MN] just seems like they have, you know, all the intelligence and all these trained people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it just seems like they could, you know, they could have found out who did it, and got the, you know, whoever did it punished right away -- I just --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- don't understand why it just took so long.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] [MN] And, um -- and, um -- how do you feel towards Middle Eastern people now?  Do you feel different about them?
R:  Yeah, of course I was paranoid when --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- yeah, 'cause, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- at first everyone talked about people with ah, Arabian, or I -- I ...
