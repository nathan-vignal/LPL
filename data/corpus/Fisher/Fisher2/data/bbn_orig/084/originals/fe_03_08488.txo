R:  Hi, I'm Evelyn.
L:  Hello, I'm Sally.
R:  Hi Sally.
L:  How are you?
R:  [LAUGH] Just great [SIGH] --
L:  Um, I live in Florida.
R:  I'm in Ohio.
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, I heard the second part of the topic, which was, do I think professional athletes deserve the salaries they receive? [SIGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  And I didn't get the first part.
R:  [SIGH] Something about the strikes -- recent strikes, and should they strike for more money, and ...
L:  Okay, okay.
R:  [SIGH] [LAUGH]
L:  Well, so what do you think about that?
R:  Uh-huh, well, [MN] I think they can do what they want to [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Uh-huh.  
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Accor- according to their rules and regulations, they can.
R:  Well, I just think, you know -- I, you know, I'm not big sports, I really am not [MN], but, if the world wants to make those guys multimillionaires, let 'em.
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Um, I -- I have -- I -- I, um, I have -- I am big into sports --
R:  Are ya?
L:  -- and I hate to see them, um, I -- I'm fifty five --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- [SIGH] and I grew -- I live in Florida now, but I grew up in Millbrook[?], Kentucky, [SIGH] and my daddy used to always take us to the baseball games.
R:  Well, sure, I mean, we go to the Reds games here in Ohio, and we love 'em, and they're doing poorly right now [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] That's when they need your support the most -- what did you say your name is?
R:  I'm Evelyn.
L:  Evelyn.  Evelyn, that's when they need your support the most [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Um, how -- may I ask how old you are?
R:  [MN] I'm thirty five.
L:  Uh-huh, so you're -- you're twenty years younger than I am --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- um, I don't think baseball, for example, ah, means -- means as much maybe now as it did twenty [MN] ah -- when -- when I was growing up.
R:  Um, yeah, I'm sure it doesn't, but you know, I'm trying to make it big for my kids, that's my important thing.
L:  [MN] Good for you.
R:  So, even though -- it's just something to get them away from TV and we don't do the video game thing, so ...
L:  Good.
R:  [MN]
L:  Um, I agree, and that -- that's what, um -- [MN] that's what my father did, it -- it was a family game, then and it's a family game now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, ah, the thing is, sports is a, um, it's a job, [SIGH] and it's a business --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- and so, yes, they can ask for whatever they can get [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah, I would if my son wants to be a --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- big league, ball player [MN] --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- he won't be big enough for football, or basketball [LAUGH], so he might play ball, [SIGH] but, um, he's only six, so, um ...
L:  So, you have a while to go [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah [inaudible].
L:  He has a while to go before he decides and before his body decides what --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- he can do.
R:  Exactly --
L:  [SIGH] Um --
R:  -- he -- he's six and I also have a six month old, so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I got the two.
L:  Also a boy?
R:  No, a girl.
L:  Well, she can do whatever sports --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- she wants to do, within reason.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  [SIGH] I don't want her to be a gymnast, just because I don't like the way gymnast's bodies end up looking [LAUGH].
L:  Uh-huh, mhm.
R:  [MN] But [MN] ... you know ...
L:  Um, I -- I think also as individuals with regarding to how much money, um, should they ask for, or how do we feel about how much money they make, [SIGH] um, a -- any -- any sports person, even a golfer, one swing and his or her back goes forever --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- well, they --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- better make some mo- -- he -- he or she had better make the money that he or she --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- is going to earn now --
R:  I agree.
L:  -- because tomorrow --
R:  They will be forgotten.
L:  -- that money may be gone.
R:  And they will be forgotten.  Except for some sports legends, you know?
L:  Yes.
R:  And, um -- and even, um sports legends that are a little bit tarnished --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- like, my Pete Rose [LAUGH].
L:  I -- I love Pete Rose --
R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  -- now, where I live, um, I'm right outside Camper -- I'm in a little -- little -- I'm in a suburb of Camper, ah -- I'm -- I'm --
R:  My sister lives there, in Brandon.
L:  Well, [inaudible] too, I lived in Seffner[?] -- you know Brandon?  
R:  I know Brandon, I don't know Cessner.
L:  [SIGH] Well, that's because Seffner is a flea speck, um, ah -- it's a suburb of Brandon [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  And Seffner is a flea speck, and I live right next door to Plant[?] City.  And Plant City is where Pete Rose hangs out, and --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Or -- or he did for -- he did for years, and so Pete and [MN] -- well of course I lived in Lawville[?], so the Reds were -- I used to -- to root for them -- I grew up in -- I grew up in -- in Lawville -- I've only been down here twenty years.
R:  Right.
L:  And, so Pete Rose is a big hero of mine, and Pete -- Pete hung out in Plant City any time he could, and so he's a big local hero too, so ... [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, that's funny.
L:  [LAUGH] The --
R:  Yeah, my sister and I don't talk baseball, so she wouldn't know -- [MN] she's --
L:  The -- the Red Birds[?] had come to Lawville the year I moved to Florida, and -- and I had just bought season tickets for my mother, who at that time was about eighty four, and I said, "I can't move to Florida ..." -- it was a job that brought me here, I said, "I can't move to Florida, mother, I just got our season tickets".  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I just hated to leave sports, my -- my little mother looked so cute -- we'd gotten hats and everything [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.
L:  But, anyway, I'm getting us off the topic, and the University of Pennsylvania won't like that.
R:  Well, you know, I think they give us the topic to have something to keep talking about, and whenever the conversation drags you go back to the original topic, and --
L:  Oh, well.
R:  That's what I'm thinking.
L:  That -- that could be, they want to see if -- if we're able to make friends and talk. [LAUGH] I'm no --
R:  Oh, I've made friends with every last one of 'em [LAUGH].
L:  I have no problem making friends and talking with strangers [LAUGH].
R:  I know, that's me.
L:  [LAUGH]  But anyway, I love Pete Rose, and I think he -- he oughta go into the Hall of Fame [LAUGH].
R:  I do too --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- oh, a- -- the last day of our stadium being there, we went to the last game, which was not an official game, it was, you know, Pete got to play and --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- some oldies but goodies, and my husband was there with his dad and our son, [SIGH] and I -- our daughter wasn't born yet, and, um, I don't think -- anyway, I can't remember that [inaudible] --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- no, I was pregnant then, okay?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, um, they cried, it was so sweet, because they got to --
L:  Oh, Evelyn, how nice.
R:  -- they got to watch Pete Rose, and, you know, my father in law, he is -- he's stoic, he's a judge here, locally, and he's stoic.  [SIGH] And, for him to get the sniffles and my husband to, you know, to [MN] sniff sniff --
L:  Oh, I just -- oh, I think that's so nice.
R:  -- it was -- it was great, so I mean, in that respect, yeah, they -- they work hard --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and, you know, they make it fun for everyb- -- Pete Rose made it fun for people.
L:  [SIGH] Yes.
R:  Um --
L:  He -- he -- he really was Charlie Hustle.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  The -- the thing, see, I'm -- I am twenty years older than you, see, I always call the Dodgers, I still call them the Brooklyn Dodgers, [SIGH] but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but the problem for me is, I have difficulty seeing sports as a business, and, if one sees sports as a business, then the answer to the questions that -- that they're asking us today, is -- is yes and yes --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and nobody should have any problem -- they wanna go on strike, people -- people who are in business, as long as it's not illegal --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and as long as they're abiding by whatever their union rules say, and so on and so forth, then the answer's yes.
R:  I agree, I really agree.
L:  And -- and, you can ask whatever salaries you want.  If --if their CEOs of companies can get whatever salaries they want, or if the union says they can have whatever salaries they want, and the rules say the caps [MN] -- they meet the caps, or what -- salary caps, or whatever, then they can have whatever money they want, and if that's -- if they're big players and the name of the game is [MN] the -- the owner makes money, by bringing people into the stadium, because the guys who hit the home runs, and -- and make the catches [SIGH] and -- and in football, or basketball, or whatever, they make the scores, that's where the owners make money, it's a business and that's the name of the game.
R:  Yep, that's how I -- that's how I feel.  I mean, football, I mean we, here, our family -- basketball is a nonexistent sport [LAUGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but football, and we don't really watch football until it gets down to the wire, and then, you know, we start watching it and then we have a Superbowl party --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [MN] but it's so funny, 'cause we don't watch it most of the time, and, you know, if we got tickets to the Superbowl, we'd probably sell 'em [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- 'cause the whole point of our Superbowl party is just, you know, to have friends over, and, um, you know, just enjoy the game and enjoy the commercials and [LAUGH] ... 
L:  Well, there was nobody worse than the Bengals but the Camper Bay Buccaneers --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I mean, we -- we were the bottom of the barrel, and of course, we're -- we're the Superbowl champs, but it's only because the -- they we- were finally able to get a coach and they were finally able to spend the money, um, and --
R:  And the coach is from Dayton --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- he's like New -- New University of Dayton, yes.
L:  A -- another tie --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but -- but, they're willing to spend the money [SIGH] on the big name players to -- in order to win a Superbowl --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and -- and so, spend the money on these guys, hey, let 'em -- I -- I don't go to the games because I can't afford the tickets, because they're sold out --
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  -- I mean, I -- I -- I would be one ...
