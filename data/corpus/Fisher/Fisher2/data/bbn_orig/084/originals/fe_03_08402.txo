L:  Hello?
R:  Hello, hi.
L:  How are you?
R:  I'm fine, how are you doing?
L:  Not too shabby.
R:  Okay, that's good. [LAUGH]
L:  My -- my name's Kyle.
R:  Mine's Lenaya.
L:  This is my first call, so --
R:  Likewise. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [inaudible] this is -- this is thoroughly entertaining.
L:  Yeah.  I guess --
R:  So --
L:  -- it's a good way to blow ten minutes, ay?
R:  Exactly, you know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- a late night and you get, you know, I guess make ten bucks. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  So, health and fitness ay?
R:  [SIGH] Yes.  Um, what did they say, uh, the -- the question was exercising regularly and -- and what type of activity?
L:  Uh --
R:  Was that what it --
L:  -- like, yeah.
R:  Okay, um --
L:  I -- I don't regu- re- exercise regularly anymore.
R:  Anymore?
L:  Anymore.
R:  Any -- uh, any particular reason for that?  Uh, that y-
L:  Well --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'm -- I'm still in school --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I got married --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, uh, I have two children now.
R:  Okay, so you're -- [MN] young children?
L:  Uh, yes, ages --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- two and brand new.
R:  Oh, that's exciting. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And with the first one I gained all the weight and then she had the baby and I didn't and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I haven't lost it since.
R:  Uh-huh. [MN] And I suppose you're running around plenty with the, uh, with --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- with two kids as much as you --
L:  -- and --
R:  -- can possibly, yeah.
L:  As much as I can.  Yeah --
R:  Fair enough.
L:  -- my --m- my biggest problem is I just don't have time, I used to race mountain bikes --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I just don't have time for it anymore, being in school and then with the family I have to work fulltime too, so --
R:  Right, so basically all your time is taken up.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  That's hard. [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I vow I will start again someday, though.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  One day.
L:  [MN]
R:  There's plenty of time --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ahead.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  Um, so I don't know, what -- [SIGH] health and fitness, basically I didn't for a really long time, um, and usually just, uh, use dancing to work out --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- uh, now I've just taken up Ashtanga yoga, which is --
L:  Well, that's --
R:  -- lots of fun and I try to go to gym -- the gym on my lunch break, [MN] which, like, gives me, like, a -- a chance to dash out of the building and then run back into the building to my lovely job.  Um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, but that's about it, um --
L:  How does that work with your stress levels?  Having to fit it in on your lunch break?
R:  Um, it actually helps me because I -- I don't -- I mean, I have a job that's sort of just supporting my creative activities outside and I feel like I resent my job a lot of the time --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so, it's really kind of good for me to -- I -- I started thinking of it as recess, um [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- 'cause I was like, "Okay, I want to the gym now, this is, like, recess" and it's fine and it breaks up the day, it actually really improves my stress level in general, so --
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  -- um, yeah.  Yeah, I'm glad I'm doing it that way, 'cause otherwise I'm just gonna sit there, like, in the office and eat, like, [NOISE] my meal in front of the computer, which just doesn't seem all that thrilling either.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I'm actually unemployed right now, I've -- I've relocated to finish school, but I re- I remember when I was working before, lunch break was exactly that, sitting in front of the computer with, um, seven eleven go go tacitos[?] and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- a big gulp and that didn't help with the weight gain. [MN]
R:  No, it doesn't, I mean that's the thing I found, I realized it was, like, "Wow, it -- I -- not only do I, like, eat a lot, um, because I'm sitting at this desk all this time, frankly because I'm kind of bored, [LAUGH] like, all right, so lunch is going to be exciting, this is, like, exciting meal, um, but I also find that I spend so much more money on food because of the way my job is set up which, anyway, it doesn't have to be that way, but, um --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I just started realizing that all round going to the gym at, like, on during my break is much better.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I'm excited because the job I just interviewed for --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- has no seven elevens within the close vicinity so --
R:  Oh, that's a good thing. [LAUGH]
L:  That should help.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  That's really useful.
L:  That's -- that's a good idea, doing it on the lunch break.
R:  Yeah, it wa- it was actually this guy sits next to me and he's, like, mister, like, muscle and fitness and always talking about, like, working out and he was, like, "I just went and did my abs" and I was looking at him, like, "You're crazy" [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and then it a- all of sudden just dawned on me, it's like, that's a really good idea. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, so --
L:  So, do you do a -- do you have a -- a full hour for your lunch break?
R:  Yeah, I have a exactly an hour, I mean, I'm like, a -- in a sort of temp si- situation, a permanent temp situation --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so, it's, like, literally you have to take an hour and so I w- it takes me twenty minutes to get to the gym and change, twenty minutes at work out and then twenty minutes to get back, uh --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, so it's not a lot but, at the same time, it's a lo- it's more than I'd be doing otherwise.
L:  Yeah, that's, uh, that's about how much I do in a week.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] No, it's not that bad, but, that -- it ha- definitely has taken a backseat, until --
R:  I can --
L:  -- I get out --
R:  -- imagine.
L:  -- of school, yeah.
R:  And do you live in a place where you can basically, like, walk around a lot, or just primarily car bound?
L:  Um, I -- I just relocated to Portland --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and I'm living with my in laws currently --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- which hasn't helped at all because they like to buy junk food.
R:  Oh, that's --
L:  So I just --
R:  -- not good, yeah.
L:  -- kind of, and -- and being unemployed right now and -- and school doesn't start till next week, so I'm just kinda sitting around in front of the computer, um, eating junk food.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, uh --
R:  That's super healthy.
L:  -- fortunately you know, I've -- I've had a lot more time to go out and ride my bike and -- and they have quite a few trails up here, too and go --
R:  Where'd you re-
L:  -- walk round and --
R:  -- where, uh, sorry, go ahead.
L:  -- and, uh, canoe, I do a lot of canoeing, well not --
R:  Oh, that's --
L:  -- a lot, but --
R:  -- so nice.
L:  Yeah, it's fun.
R:  Yeah, people have been trying to talk me into going to Portland.  I -- I, like, I live in New York City and that's one of the things that -- lack of nature has made being physical really, really hard for me, um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- 'cause I've don't like -- I don't like gyms, to be honest, I'd rather go out and, like, go bike riding somewhere pretty, um --
L:  Yeah, that was --
R:  -- but --
L:  -- one of -- that was one of the reasons that I agreed, well my wife is from here --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's one of the reasons I agreed to come here is because I -- I love the outdoors.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, right now I'm sitting [NOISE] ten minutes drive away from the airport, but I see nothing but trees around me.
R:  That's unbelievable.
L:  It's -- it's really cool.
R:  Yeah, people hi- highly recommend Portland, I hear that all the time, that's awesome.
L:  Yeah.  Plus I'm -- I'm a graphic designer and the art --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- community here is huge.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So it's -- it's really nice.
R:  Mm, just it seems like into art people are, like, generally healthy minded. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, they --
R:  Just choose --
L:  -- definitely are.
R:  -- the -- yeah.  Personality --
L:  And then --
R:  -- wise, just spiritually, everything, yeah.
L:  Yeah, and then also being a cyclist, it's -- it's huge up here.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Cycling is, so, yeah, it was definitely a good move for me.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  Now, if I can just, uh, drop the weight that I gained --
R:  Now, did you move --
L:  -- with the babies --
R:  -- out -- [MN] uh, did you move out there from the --
L:  From --
R:  -- West Coast?
L:  -- from Utah.
R:  Oh, okay, okay.
L:  -- from the -- the high desert.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  So, I went from -- from [NOISE] brown desert to green.
R:  Mm, to green, well, I hope that's a good change. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, definitely.  I --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I love green.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  It's really nice here too, because it's, uh, you've got the big city right there --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- Portland is a fairly large city, so, which I enjoy having --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- all the resources right there.
R:  Yeah, I can imagine. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, I'd like -- see, I've never been out to Portland or to Seattle, two places that I want to go to.  Um, I -- I'm trying to undo being an East Coast person, but actually, that again re- relates to health and fitness, [LAUGH] um [COUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- excuse me, because I keep thinking, um, I have family down in, um, Southern California, if I move out there, just -- just, um, anyway, [MN] I -- I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a lot of people I know here -- I have friends who moved here from sa- San Francisco and they were so excited to come back here because they said, "Well, I can come to New York and I can wear black and smoke cigarettes and no one's gonna look funny at me". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I was, like, "Well, I'm sorry you couldn't do that in San Francisco, but you're a bad influence". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  So --
L:  It does relate to health and fitness though, where you live is -- I mean, it -- it totally relates to your health --
R:  It's true.
L:  -- I mean, just even your mental well being.  I was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- going nuts in Utah.
R:  Yeah.  Why --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because not much was, like, [MN] ju- just --
L:  Uh, just the -- the climate and the weather.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, it -- the -- the summers were totally dry and you'd get into, you know, a hundred and twenty degrees --
R:  Oh, God.
L:  -- and ten percent humidity --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and my opinion is, you can always put more clothes on, but you can only take so many off.
R:  That's true.
L:  So -- yeah, and I -- I love the rain and there's --
R:  Yes, it's --
L:  -- definitely a lot of it here, so [NOISE] --
R:  -- is it, like, rainy in a sort of dreary sort of way, or just rainy --
L:  Uh, no, well, Seattle --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- Seattle has a lot of rain --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and it just rains non stop and it's hard rain.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Whereas in Portland it's a little bit lighter, like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- right now, from about June to August, it doesn't rain hardly at all.
R:  Okay.
L:  Uh, I've been here two and a half months steadily now and it's rained, maybe five days.
R:  Wow.
L:  Um, but once -- once, like, August, September hits, it's, you know, and it's -- it's not a constant rain, but it'll be overcast and it'll drizzle a little bit and it's -- it's a happy, cheery rain, I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like it.
R:  That's really nice.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  I just --
L:  And it --
R:  -- I hear a plane. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah, like I said, ten minutes from the airport.
R:  [LAUGH] Wow.
L:  Yeah.  But it's nice.
R:  So, I wonder, like, I'm -- I just [MN] in general wonder if this thing -- obviously I'm sure they're not like, they could care less about health and fitness, I'm just curious about this study does, what's their linguistic data, but [NOISE] --
L:  They're -- they're studying, uh, vocal inflections and patterns, I believe.
R:  Uh, okay, so you actually read the information on it. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  And --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- uh, how they make you enter what kind of device you're call ...
