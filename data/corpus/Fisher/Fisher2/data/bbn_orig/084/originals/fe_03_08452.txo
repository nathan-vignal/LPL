R:  Hello, my name is Desir- -- [NOISE]
L:  H- Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, how you doing?
R:  I'm doing good [NOISE].
L:  Good, good.
R:  My name is Desiree.
L:  Yeah, my name is Jeff.
R:  Jeff?
L:  Yes.
R:  Great.
L:  Uh-huh.  Um, I don't really know how my life has changed since September the eleventh.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  We -- we all are just a little bit more careful now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, around our house, so, uh, how -- how has yours changed?
R:  Well, I kind of, um, I'm a lot more fearful.  I won't lie.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  You know, I -- I'm just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [NOISE] you know, you know what?  Today my children and I were at the grocery store --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, uh, a woman had on a tee shirt and it said, "Proud to be America -- uh, Proud to be American, um, still going strong" up under it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, I mean, it touched my heart, right there [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  And I've never considered myself patriotic at all.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I love my country now, no matter what has happened in the past, you know.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I --
R:  So, that's how I feel [LAUGH].
L:  -- I pastor -- I pastor a church and, uh, I guess that that has -- has been one thing I have seen people, I think, uh, draw closer in their faith anyway to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, since September the eleventh.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, you know, I -- I guess -- I guess, like you, I'm -- I'm, um, I'm more patriotic than I used to be.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, you know, it -- it we still fly our flag around here and -- and that's something that I don't think we did as much as before so ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's, uh -- and that- that's a -- that's a good thing.
R:  I mean, I won't say it's a l- love hate thing 'cause there's some things going on in our country --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- right now that have --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- me upset and fuming, you know, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- still at the same time it's my country. [LAUGH]
L:  That's right.  That's right.  And I d- I don't reckon it'll ever be perfect but it is -- it is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the best one that I know of to live in anyway.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] So --
R:  [NOISE] Well, somebody's always coming --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- you know.
L:  That's right.  The- they're -- they're coming here from another place to get away from there so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, that's a good thing.
R:  It's a compliment, I think, [NOISE] it's okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It, uh, confirms what the country is supposed to be, you know, built upon --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- the milking pot or whatever.
L:  That's right.
R:  And it gets a little rough with different cultures and ideas and fads and religions and oh, it's just so much, you know.
L:  That's right.
R:  When you go to your, you know, major part of your city and you see the different kinds of people and [NOISE] the traffic and all those wonderful things, or ride through the country land, I mean, I think all of that has really made me appreciate it more with that happening.
L:  And, you know, it -- there -- there is one thing at least we're free to, um, have all those differences --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, and -- and then a lot of countries, you know, you're -- you're not free to -- to have those kind of things, or at least speak about 'em openly.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, so I -- I -- I think that's a good thing for -- for our country [NOISE].
R:  Well, how has the church changed in your view, I mean, are people -- are you guys, um, praying more at your church.
L:  Well, um, I think -- I think the thing that has changed in -- in our particular church more than anything else is -- is that people, you know, [NOISE] we -- we tend to -- to value our life more.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, a -- a -- a lot of people, uh, either knew a family who had some people there, um, I -- I know, um, I know of a lot of people that had relatives --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- who had, um, family members that worked there.  And I think that --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- that has -- has really helped our -- our church to look at life a little bit different and, you know, we -- we all stay so busy --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but -- but, I think, we have -- have learned how to value that day to day kind of -- of value on life --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- now that, uh, we didn't have.  Um, I -- I think that's the thing that -- that has really changed about us, you know, it -- w- we tend to value that -- that daily bread instead of the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the long term thing. [NOISE]
R:  Exactly.  Yeah, our church is more -- you know, everybody's doing all these new random acts of kindness and --
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] that's right.
R:  -- you know, everybody --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you go in Walgreen's or what- whatever your major, um, [LIPSMACK] drugstore or -- or, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and there's America cups and, I mean, it's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- where only used to saw that on the fourth of July --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in different times.
L:  That's true.
R:  It's just affecting everybody.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We're doing -- we're talking about it, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well -- well, you know, at -- at least that -- that is -- has brought out people that -- that, uh, we can learn to -- to -- to talk about things more openly.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  You know, I think, um, y- you know, there's so many times we get so caught up in our -- our little things that we forget that -- that -- that other people are hurting.
R:  That's right.
L:  And -- and I think at least since September the eleventh we -- we tend to at least look at people and -- and -- and see their hurts and -- and s- maybe can understand 'em a little bit better.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  So, I think that's a good thing.
R:  Yeah, very good.
L:  I sure do.
R:  Well, I mean, if you look at your Bible and or -- or any ho- almost any holy book --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- there -- there's a trial and a tribulation and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there's gonna be casualties and things but hopefully some good can come from it, I guess.
L:  That's right, that's right.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I -- I think that the thing of it is -- is -- is really how -- how you -- you respond to something, you know, things can either make you better or things can you bitter.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, I think if it -- if it has a -- a -- a perspective to where it makes you better then it -- it -- it tends to be a good thing, in the end.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Regardless of how it starts out.  So ...
R:  Well, what state are you in?
L:  North Carolina.
R:  Okay, I'm in Ohio.
L:  Oh okay. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, um, in, uh, well, uh, in fact this week from today, uh, I'm gonna be going to New York and it, uh --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- this'll be the first time that I've ever flown in an airplane --
R:  Oh okay.
L:  -- so, uh, I -- I guess the September the eleventh has changed the way I look about airplanes [NOISE] anyway.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  But, uh, it's, uh, it's quite an experience for me.  So, um, I, um, I -- I have to go to, uh, Sloan Kettering Hospital for, uh --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I've -- I have cancer --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and, um, I'll -- I'll be going there for hopefully some treatments so, um, this is not something that I -- I want to do but it's something that I've got to do.
R:  Well, I -- I hope things go well for you.
L:  Thank you, ma'am.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Thank you, ma'am.  What part of Ohio are you from?
R:  Cincinnati.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Okay.
R:  Here, with the Reds. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, yeah [LAUGH].  Well -- well, that's good, that's good.  I -- I'm always glad to people that I don't know from different states.
R:  Okay.
L:  You know, that -- that's one thing that has made us all Americans, isn't it?  All of our --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- differences.
R:  That's right.
L:  Um, it's like you said --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- before, [inaudible] we- we're known as a melting pot but sometime we -- we don't let 'em all melt together.
R:  [LAUGH] That's right.
L:  [LAUGH] And --
R:  Sometimes we don't get along with another in general, I mean --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- you know, no matter what.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Things just go -- our city is a city under -- um, it was a city under rest --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that was, um, about a year or two, I think, ago.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I just -- I still was happy to be American [LAUGH].
L:  That's right.  I hear you.  I'm glad to be American too.  And I -- I figure that -- that there's so many other places that I could be, I'm glad that -- that -- that the Lord saw fit to have me born here.
R:  Well, when I talked to some people --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or and -- and I see -- I see it on TV how they -- how foreigners talk about, "Oh" you know, "This is the first time something like this has happen to you all".
L:  Mhm.
R:  We see this every day.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That makes you feel good too.
L:  That's right.
R:  Feel -- feel safe, you know.
L:  That's right, that's right.  You know and -- and, you know, w- we -- we still have plenty to eat in this country and -- and, um, we -- we don't know how it is to have our streets [NOISE] being bombed and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, constantly under some kind of -- of nuclear weapon or nuclear warfare --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- and so that's a -- that's a good way to -- that's a good way to at least appreciate our country a little bit -- bit more.  All right.
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know, I just never thought I'd be as patriotic as I am now.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, my six year old she wants to put her pin on --
L:  Oh right.
R:  -- every chance she gets.  She has one of those little dollar pins --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, with the flag on it and it hurt my feelings for her to see it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And she just asked, "Is it real?"
L:  Yeah.
R:  I didn't know what to say.  It was right before the professional were on TV telling you what to tell the kids --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I just figured --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I said, "Yeah, but we're gonna be fine, it's far away --"
