L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name is Reuben.
L:  Hi Reuben.  This is Linda.
R:  Hi Linda, how are you?
L:  I'm pretty good.  So what -- something about athletes and the high --
R:  Yeah, athletes and the strikes, do you think they deserve ah, the money?
L:  I didn't even know they were on strike [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, it said recent strikes.
L:  Oh, what sport?  Oh, just any strikes in general when they go on strike just to get more money?  Is that the general conversation?  Okay.
R:  Right, correct.
L:  Are you a big sports fan?
R:  I am.  I am a big sports fan.
L:  I -- I was in my youth, but after having kids I never have time to watch TV any more, so -- so what do you think?  Should they get the big pay that they -- always demand?
R:  I think in my opinion, it's ah, mostly the fault of the owners.  I think if they can hold down and strike because they think they'll get more than ah, then that's their right, whether they're right or wrong.  Who -- who's to say?
L:  Do you think maybe they should cap it?
R:  Um, yeah, I mean, if the owners get together and cap it, then that would be a viable option too.  Again, whether that's good or bad is ah --
L:  But then you got someone like Michael Jordan who's obviously, you know, fifty times greater than the next guy, doesn't he deserve to get paid fifty times more?
R:  Um --
L:  I mean, you could have that argument, you know?
R:  Yeah.  That -- that -- that's a good point, but ah, again, the managers have to manage.  Okay, you give Michael fifty times more but you have to be able to build the team.  Now are you willing to pay Michael fifty times more because he's that much better?
L:  Right.  But then you got to have enough left over to -- for the other --
R:  To pay the rest of the team, exactly --
L:  -- nine players or four players, yeah --
R:  -- so, I mean take Alex Rodriguez for example, in Texas, the owner game him a hundred and twenty million dollar contract and now he regrets because he put all his eggs in one basket.  He realizes he's not going to win a championship with one great player --
L:  He can't afford to complete the team is what you're saying.
R:  -- he can't afford to pay any good players, so --
L:  Yeah, that does make sense.  Well see, I -- I live in south Florida, and about what, a good six or seven years ago I think it's been now, maybe not even that long, we won the -- the baseball World Series --
R:  Right.  Right, Florida --
L:  -- that was basically because they bought the team.
R:  Exactly.  And they bought a couple of Philadelphia guys, because I'm up here in Philly.
L:  You know -- I mean -- we -- yeah.  We never did it again since then.  You know, that was it, they had that one year contract and they lost after that --
R:  So they bought a championship --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I don't think baseball has a salary cap so they can go out and spend whatever they want and buy the -- championship.
L:  Yeah, so now it's kind of a bummer now because, you know, we had like that false sense of feeling that, you know, oh we got this great team, and yeah, it was for that one year that we -- that they could afford to buy the championship.  But then after that they couldn't afford any more and now the team sucks again. [LAUGH]  So --
R:  And -- and the owner can't go cry- -- crying poor because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- he's the one who paid all those guys.  He wanted the championship --
L:  Yeah, he's the one who put it that way --
R:  -- he -- he paid all that money and now um --
L:  -- and now they all expect to always get paid like that, you know.
R:  Exactly, so -- and if -- and if you can hold out and, I mean, any normal person, not just athletes, but if you can, um, hold out to get a certain amount of money, why shouldn't you?  You should go for the most you can or the best -- do the best you can --
L:  Yeah, if you're skilled and whatever's worth it, then pay it.  Yeah, exactly, I agree with that.
R:  So -- so, um --
L:  But yeah, well a lot of people get a lot of enjoyment out of watching the sports [inaudible] and you know those -- those owners are making the money, so if they want keep making big money they have to --
R:  Exactly.  That was going to be my next point --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- if they're not making money --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- they're not in it to lose money --
L:  -- right.  You know they're making it, so --
R:  -- so they gotta be making money to stick with it and they also got to be making it to be paying it out because nobody's in it to lose money --
L:  -- yeah, so I'm not -- I'm surely not going to be crying for the owners and mangers, that's for sure, I mean, you know, like I said, they're definitely -- they're going to be the last ones to lose any money.
R:  Sure, sure --
L:  So, yeah --
R:  -- and any normal person, when they go for a job interview, you're going to get the most you think you deserve or the most you can get, so if an athlete thinks he can get more by striking, they get together and better benefits then ah, you know, that's their right they have in -- in this society.  But the owners, they also have the right to get together and say we're going to cap it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so, ah --
L:  Yeah, that would, you know, solve their problem if you want to call it that, you know, if they just all agree, you know, but --
R:  Yeah -- but ah --
L:  -- they're not -- they're not going to all agree because they -- because they want to try to beat each other.
R:  Exactly.  It's an ego thing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like you said with Michael Jordan getting ah, fifty million, he thinks, "I'm the best, so ah, I should, ah, get more than everybody else."
L:  What's up with Michael Jordan anyway?  He played all of those years with the Bulls, [inaudible], all the championship and decided to retire, then he comes back and goes to another team.  You think that makes him look bad because they're not winning championships, so it wasn't Michael Jordan's big skill all this time, or ?
R:  No --
L:  What do you think of that?
R:  -- well, in my opinion, Michael Jordan, um --
L:  He should have stayed retired, I mean, he's -- you know --
R:  -- wanted -- wanted a new -- well, he wanted a new challenge too, and -- and -- and let's face it, he was a big part of why they won the championship but um, there was other people involved too --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there was Scotty Pippin, there was the coach --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- now, ah, coach Phil Jackson is in Los Angeles and he's won three championships there.  So there was a lot of other ingredients that went into that championship although Michael Jordan was the focal point.  But ah --
L:  Well being such a strong focal point you think that makes him like maybe he wasn't quite as bad as everyone thought now that he's not really doing much for the team he's on now?
R:  Well, he also is ah, ten years older --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- than he was, so you know, to say he's not the same player --
L:  People seem to not realize that --
R:  -- to say he's not the be- -- best, ah, same player, that's definitely true because ah, he's also ten years older, but um, you know --
L:  Yeah.  I think I would have stayed out while I was ahead though.  I don't know if I'd of gone back in knowing I'm ten years older and I wouldn't be as good.  And of course, you're going to be compared to yourself ten years earlier, so --
R:  But, you know, your ego gets the better part of you because you feel you can do it and you want to prove you can do it, and boxers have that ah, that -- that -- that problem --
L:  It couldn't have been for the money. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- they're over -- they're over the hill and ah, they still think they can compete.  It's an ego thing.  Michael Jordan still thinks he can compete at a high level, but ah, definitely, we all know not -- definitely not the level he used to, so --
L:  Yeah, he just can't fly like he used to. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, yeah, that's true.  But ah, you know, the strikes -- the -- I mean, the real losers with the strikes are the fans.  Ah, when they had the baseball strike, I believe it was back in ninety three, I had stopped going to baseball games and said I wouldn't support it, but ah, I don't know if it was ninety three exactly when the baseball strike was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but then your team starts doing well and you do get interested --
L:  And you get back in the spirit, yeah.
R:  -- and -- and -- and -- yeah, and they're good for the city, you know, because the city has a good ah, a feel for ah, for themselves because your team's doing well and you take pride in that.  But um --
L:  Yeah, I always follow football more myself than anything.  I'm originally from Texas, so --
R:  Oh, that's a big football state, yes --
L:  -- you know, I'm from the days of Roger Starbuck and, you know --
R:  Yeah, yeah, big high school football --
L:  Tony Dorsett, you know --
R:  -- I mean from high school all the way up to the pros --
L:  -- yeah.
R:  -- and I -- I'm Philadelphia, so you know the rivalry we've had with the --
L:  Oh god yeah, that's big time, too, yeah.
R:  -- Cowboys and the, ah, and the Eagles back in the late seventies and early eighties.
L:  And the Eagles, yeah.  Oh yeah.
R:  But ah, and the ah, football strike was interesting too because back when they had the football strike, um, they actually hired what everybody called "scab" players --
L:  Yeah, the scabs.
R:  -- and they ah -- they played and that was a big thing here in Philadelphia, because Philadelphia's a big union town so they would support the ah, the NFL players and picket with them --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and picket the games and there were some fights and everything because people were paying to go in and see the scabs --
L:  I can imagine --
R:  -- and ah, people were upset with that, but um 
L:  Yeah, it's hard to decide whether you're going to support the guy whenever he makes, you know, ten times more money than you are and all you want to do is just relax on the weekend and watch a game. [LAUGH] It's re- -- it's real hard to get that mentality.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, it's hard to feel sorry for a guy who pays -- who's getting paid five million or for a guy who's sitting out because he wants six million --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but the truth of the matter is he wouldn't do it unless he knew the owners would pay it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So they -- they downgrade, you know, they battle with each other.  They have egos too, these owners --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and ah --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- especially like the guy with the Dallas Mavericks, he has, you know, he's paying trying to get a championship and ah, yeah, some owners that are -- that have made themselves rich outside of sports and then they ah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- try to buy themselves a championship like they did in Florida, you know, Wayne Joseanga[?], I believe it was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that ah, won the championship down there.  So, I mean, these guys are paying it so the athletes strike because they know they can do it.  And they know they'll get the money, eventually.
L:  Yeah, they're almost making as much off the -- off the course with all their sponsorships and stuff too, now.
R:  Well, Michael Jordan --
L:  Yeah, Jordan.
R:  -- he used to make eight million dollars a year playing basketball, forty million dollars a year with endorsements.
L:  Yeah.  Right.  So, yeah.  I agree.  But --
R:  But um, I think --
L:  -- it -- it's amazing how they -- a hundred million, you said, was some guy's contract now?  A hundred and twenty?
R:  Hundred and twenty million.
L:  Jeeze.  I remember when like, ten million was, like, unheard of.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, a hundred and twenty -- how many years does that cover, hm?
R:  Um, I think it's about, ah, less than ten years.  Maybe eight years.
L:  Yeah.  Jeeze.
R:  You know?  So, he's getting -- he's getting quite a bit of change but the guy came out and said he regrets it because he spent all this money on one athlete now and he can't afford to build the team around them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, um, and I think Jordan actually, you know, took a pay cut or whatever, to get some players in to help him win those championships in Chicago, because one guy getting all the money wasn't going to get it done so when they bought in Scotty Pippin and some of the other support players --
L:  Right.
R:  -- as a matter of fact, a lot of that's happening now.  Carl Malone was just in the news.  He's signing for the NBA minimum and Garry Paintin has signed for the NBA minimum, just 'cause they want to win the championship.
L:  There's a minimum? [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Well, a veteran minimum.
L:  What's the minimum? [LAUGH] 
R:  A vetera- -- I think it's one point four million a year, in the NBA.
L:  Oh yeah, chump change. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Really. 
R:  Yeah, so they just signed --
L:  That's funny.
R:  -- for the ah, NBA, and that was something was --
L:  Poor guy working for a minimum wage. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and that was something that was negotiated because the players struck and they had a strike and they decided, you know, you just can't force us to play for anything so there's going to be a minimum and they established that, so they got --
L:  So if they played for less to get this championship team and they win the championship achieves it, do- -- obviously they get some kind of major bonuses for that.  Is that what they're hoping for if they take -- take a pay cut then they'll make it up in the bonuses, or ?
R:  I don't think so.  I don't think the --
L:  Well what would they be doing it for besides just having a trophy and a championship ring on your finger?
R:  Having a trophy because they've done everything else.
L:  That's incentive enough?
R:  They've -- Carl Malone has won MVP, he's ah, made millions
