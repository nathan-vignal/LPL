R:  H- Hi!
L:  H- h- hi!
R:  This is Mystique, How are you?
L:  Misty?
R:  Mystique.
L:  Mystique, oh, --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- I'm sorry.  This is Tracy.  How are you?
R:  I'm fine.  [SIGH]  And you're calling from?
L:  M- Michigan.
R:  Okay.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I'm in Philadelphia but, um, this is, ah, an -- an interesting topic because I'm actually, um, on a diet and I, um, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I try to work out, um, [LIPSMACK] four days a week and do at least, um, thirty minutes of cardio.
L:  Oh, my goodness!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  O- okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  Huh!  I mean, [LIPSMACK] it's not that bad, you know, you [NOISE] -- but -- I -- I mean, I lost, um, [NOISE] -- thirty two pounds, -- I mean, [NOISE] so far.  But I'm trying to, like, um, hit, you know, I -- I mean, [LIPSMACK] maybe fifty.  [SIGH]  So, like, I have a good, [SIGH] um, twenty more pounds to do.  Uh-hum.
L:  Oh, my goodness!  [SIGH]  Well, I d- don't exercise as much as I should.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  I have, um, ... two very young children.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  And since h- having children I just don't have time.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [SIGH]  I mean I would love to.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, um, --
L:  And -- and my goal is to --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- lose twenty pounds.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  But it's like, okay, I just -- I just don't feel like I have the t- time to [NOISE] really dedicate to myself right now.  [SIGH]  Um, and I know that's terrible and it's really not an excuse but ... but it just -- that's my excuse, I guess.
R:  I don't have kids.  I mean, so I guess [LIPSMACK] it's just fine for me.
L:  Right.  [NOISE]  Right.
R:  So, ...  [LAUGH]
L:  I think that helps.  I really do.
R:  Uh-huh.  I do think it helps but, um, [NOISE] as far as eating right, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't think I eat right at all, you know.  Because, [SIGH] u- um, [LIPSMACK] let's see, okay, this is what my diet contains.  I only drink water.  I don't drink juice or soda or, like, [MN] [LIPSMACK] anything.  It's j- just, um, water that I drink.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Wow!
R:  And I only eat, um, Olderson[?] noodles.  They have different, like, [LIPSMACK] -- um, heard of those?
L:  [SIGH]  No.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Like, the cup soup.  Like, the soups in the cups?
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  Okay.  [SIGH]  Um, I only eat those and I mean, like, just three of those per day with just, um, water and I exercise, you know, like do my cardio.  I mean that's all I eat but it's not a healthy meal and I know that.  But, [SIGH] I mean, [LIPSMACK] it's -- it's the only way that I have found that -- that, um, actually helps me lose the weight.
L:  Right.
R:  So, [NOISE] [SIGH] but to make up for not eating, um, [LIPSMACK] -- um, [LIPSMACK] ah, [LIPSMACK] healthy I, um, I try to take, um, vitamins.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, [SIGH] that's about it.  [LAUGH]
L:  S- so, have you, um, [LIPSMACK] -- have you gone on diets before and lost all the weight and then gained [NOISE] it back?
R:  [SIGH]  As a matter of fact, yes.  Um, I have gone on a diet before and I lost, um, like twenty pounds.  And I was just so, like, unhappy that I went back to, like, um, eating my old ways and not thinking that, [NOISE] um, -- that I would gain the weight [NOISE] [SIGH] that fast.  But I --
L:  Right.
R:  -- did and it was like, "Wow".  So, um, I had to work off [NOISE] all that, [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] um, additional weight that I gained.  And I was just so, like, upset about it.  [NOISE]  But, [SIGH] you know, yes, I have gone on a diet, [NOISE] lost a lot and then gained it right back.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  So, [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Yeah.  I -- I've kind of done the same thing, but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- not -- not a lot [NOISE] of weight, I mean, just like, [NOISE] five or ten pounds --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- here or there, you know.  I haven't ever really gone on a major diet to lose a major amount of weight.
R:  Okay.
L:  [SIGH]  Which, after two kids I've -- [NOISE] I'm probably about twenty pounds more than what I should be.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, I should p- probably be doing something.  And I've thought about it but [SIGH] again, [NOISE] I just don't ... feel that, you know, the time right now is --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- [SIGH] is on my side.  Because it's, like, as soon as I get the kids into bed I just feel like --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- c- crashing, you --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- know.  [LAUGH]
R:  I understand.
L:  [SIGH]  So, um, [MN] yeah, I mean and I just -- [SIGH] I don't know, I mean they always talk about how [LIPSMACK] overweight the nation is and everything.
R:  Uh-hum.  That's true.
L:  And how everyone should be ... exercising more and watching what you eat and everything.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  And then there's [SIGH] people suing McDonalds because --
R:  Yeah, r- [LAUGH] right.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I mean, you know, that --
R:  That's weird.
L:  -- just -- it doesn't make sense --
R:  It doesn't.
L:  -- to me.  [SIGH]
R:  It doesn't.
L:  It's just crazy, you know, to sue McDonalds because --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- you are over weight because of eating their product and it's like, "Well, hello?"  I mean, if you're gonna go and eat ... the Big Macs --"
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  "-- and the French fries and everything, obviously it's all fat.  [SIGH]
R:  I would sue them [NOISE] but I [LIPSMACK] mean I just wouldn't sue them, you know, for that reason.  I mean, --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- that's just stupid right there.  But [SIGH] I also believe that, um, [LIPSMACK] insurance should cover, um, weight loss for obese people.
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, I believe ... yes, I -- I --
R:  So, ...
L:  -- agree with that.
R:  I mean --
L:  And --
R:  -- some people don't have the time.  Some people can't afford it, you know.  Um, I don't take, like, um, [LIPSMACK] any medication.  I'm so, like, afraid of it because, [SIGH] um, [LIPSMACK] my cousin, like, she went to her doctor and he told her, like, most [NOISE] diet pills, t- they have, like, some kind of side effect.  Like, people, like, um, a good thirty years ... [LIPSMACK] later, like, [SIGH] um, [LIPSMACK] they have, like, heart problems [NOISE] and liver problems.  And I'm just like, you know what, I'm gonna do this the normal way and it's going to be the hard way.  And I mean [SIGH] it is hard.  I didn't even, um, work out today, you know, because I'm giving my body time to rest but [SIGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's hard.  [SIGH]  So, --
L:  Oh, yeah.  [SIGH]  Yeah, and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I know, and I -- I k- know that, um, [NOISE] a lot of the diet drugs and stuff [NOISE] are terrible on your body.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  I mean in -- I've heard of [SIGH] certain ones causing cancers later in --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- life and everything else.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean it's -- it's just not worth it.  [SIGH]
R:  Not at all.
L:  No, I mean [SIGH] about the most exercise I get is when I p- put my kids in the stroller and go out for walks, --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- which we do quite often.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  But --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- chasing them round all day [NOISE] is my exercise, --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- I think.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Which is -- is all right.
R:  [NOISE]  Mm.
L:  You know, I mean I definitely -- I don't [NOISE] sit down much --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- during the day.  So, [SIGH] I guess it's a -- it's a good thing but, [SIGH] yeah, they -- they definitely are my work out.  [SIGH] 
R:  Okay.
L:  So, [SIGH] one of these days I'm hoping to [SIGH] b- be able -- I mean I have all this exercise equipment just sitting here.
R:  Oh, really, --
L:  And I --
R:  'cause I have none.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- really, I just [SIGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I use it to hang my laundry on, --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know.  I mean [LAUGH] that's --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- how terrible it is.  I just, --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- [SIGH] you know, it's s- sitting here so I may as well use it for something so it's my laundry.  But --
R:  I have none so, I mean, basically everything I do I'm doing it myself.  Um, the only thing I have is a, um, -- is a +Denise Austin on [SIGH] Pilates book.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  That's it.  I mean --
L:  Do you like Pilates?
R:  [MN]  U- um, as a matter of fact I do but, I mean some of them are a bit hard and I'm a novice and I'm not, like, you know breaking my bones to do it.  So, [SIGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I really don't do it.  [NOISE]  But, um, [LIPSMACK] I would -- [LIPSMACK] I would, ah, probably take up a class.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  I've heard a lot about it --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but I -- I, -- you know, I don't [NOISE] know a lot about it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's like I've heard a lot of people saying how wonderful it is but I just -- I don't know really a whole lot about it.  So, [SIGH] --
R:  I don't either.  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  So, ah, --
L:  Yeah, I just, um, [LIPSMACK] really need to get back into some sort of [NOISE] routine of -- of some sort.  So, [SIGH] one of these days, I guess.  [SIGH]  It's, um, -- do you go to the gym or --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- anything?
R:  No, not at all.
L:  No?
R:  Everything I do I do it --
L:  It's just [NOISE] right at home?
R:  -- at home.  Everything I do, I do it at home.  Um, --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] I don't have weights I mean so [SIGH] I lift bricks.  I work out with bricks as funny as it might seem.  And I mean, like, people ask me [SIGH] [MN] do it work?  And I'm, like, yes, it look like it's not working but it works, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH]  I jog in place for, um, thirty minutes and I do sweat and, [NOISE] you know, it does work.  [PAUSE]
L:  Wow, that's neat.
R:  Um, actually I jog and I walk because I'm supposed to do, like, um, ... do both, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  So, your body don't get, like, familiar with doing the same thing.
L:  Right.
R:  So, [SIGH] I do both and it works.  You know, I just ... watch my TV and [LIPSMACK] work out.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my goodness!  [SIGH]  Wow, how old are you?
R:  [NOISE]  I'm eighteen.
L:  You're eighteen?
R:  Yes.  I'm eighteen.
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  And, um, [LIPSMACK] the reason [NOISE] why, like, I started this -- well, I mean, like before, I mean, like I [LIPSMACK] -- I didn't care but, um, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- doctors said, like, for someone my height and my age [NOISE] I should be a +specific weight.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, um, I'm six two.  So, I mean, that's pretty tall and --
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  -- yeah.  And, um, [LIPSMACK] I was two twenty four.  It wasn't, like, obese fat but, you know, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] I could still stand to lose, like, a good, maybe twenty pounds.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And, um, my weight goal is [MN] one fifty five through one, um, ninety -- no, um, [SIGH] it's one fifty five through one [LIPSMACK] ninety eight and I, um, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I am one, um, ninety now but I want to be one seventy five.  So, I'm -- I'm in my weight range, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but I still want to go down more.  [NOISE]
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH]  So, I don't know.
L:  Exactly.  [SIGH]  I understand that.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  Wow, you are probably [NOISE] about [SIGH] a foot taller than I am.  I'm five two.
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK]  So, --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and my --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- weight should be [SIGH] -- I'm trying to think --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- [SIGH] between, --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- like, one twenty and one thirty or --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- something like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I'm at, like, one fifty.
R:  Okay.
L:  [SIGH]  So, [SIGH] I'm, um, that's where my twenty pounds comes in with -- that I could stand to lose.  So, [SIGH] --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- yeah.  [SIGH]  Um, --
R:  I get it.
L:  -- my -- my husband is r- really tall.  He's about your height.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  So, [SIGH] um, it's ... kind of ... strange because, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, you know his -- he -- he weighs so much more but, yet he --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- doesn't look [LAUGH] like it.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, [SIGH] um, --
L:  It's, like, when you're taller --
R:  -- [NOISE] yes, the taller you are --
L:  -- you can weigh so much more and it's --
R:  -- yes, you look smaller.
L:  -- uh-hum, that's --
R:  So, I mean, um, [LIPSMACK] if I was to maybe drop down to five eight, and I'm five eight and one ninety, [LIPSMACK] I would look real ... [MN] over weight.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [MN]  So, [SIGH] --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- the height, um, [LIPSMACK] make a difference, you know?
L:  Yes, it does --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- definitely.  [SIGH]  And I've always [NOISE] been challenged with my height.  So, ... [LAUGH]
R:  Does he work -- does your husband work out?  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  He does, actually.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, he lifts weights and things.  [SIGH]  So, --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I mean he's not really muscular but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- he does it just -- just to keep toned.
R:  That's good.  I'm trying to get toned too but I don't have the right equipment so [SIGH] it's a bit harder.
L:  Right.
R:  But, [SIGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- yeah, time does everything wrong.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yep, it's ah, [SIGH] --
R:  Time does it.
L:  Yep.  Definitely.  [SIGH]  So, --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- well you're young [NOISE] still too.  [SIGH]
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  And, um, how old are you?
L:  I'm thirty two.
R:  Okay.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  So, ah, -- I, ah, -- I used to be definitely into ... exercise and things before children.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  But [SIGH] afterwards it just kind of [SIGH] --
R:  That's true.  I mean kids do slow you down, you know, I mean --
L:  Oh, yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  -- because I'm a nanny and I mean, [LIPSMACK] I --
L:  Oh!
