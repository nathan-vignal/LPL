R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, my name's Bob and I'm in Los Angeles.
R:  Oh cool.  My name's Richard.  I'm in Seattle.  I used to live in the Woodland Hills.
L:  Oh, we live in -- right up the street from Woodland Hills, up in West Hills.
R:  Really?
L:  Yes.
R:  Cool.
L:  So --
R:  Um, um, um, um, well, [SIGH] I guess very honestly, uh, my life hasn't changed that much just pretty much when I got to the airport [LAUGH].
L:  Uh, well --
R:  You go to either pick up people or to travel.
L:  I think -- I think that's probably a pretty accurate statement.  I think, um, the airport is probably the most visible change --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- uh, I know I went travelling recently and had to take my shoes off and my belt off and empty my pockets --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and all that good stuff.  But -- but another place that it's changed is, um, my place of employment now has very heavy security which in the past --
R:  I bet.
L:  -- they've -- they've never had.  We now have these hydraulic --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, things that come out of the, um, side -- out of the h- the, uh, parking area if someone, you know, breaks through a barrier or things like that.
R:  [NOISE] Oh yes.
L:  So -- so I think that's -- that's one of the major changes.  Um, I basically, uh, I think I'm a little, I don't want to use the term paranoid, but a little more observant of things around me and -- and there are probably places that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I avoid more than I might normally avoid.  Uh, subconsciously not --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- intentionally.  Uh, for example, I pr- I'm not a big baseball fan but I won't go to Dodger Stadium just, um --
R:  [NOISE] Okay.
L:  -- I -- I mean, I would- I wouldn't normally go there anyway but I think I'm more --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- aware of the fact that I probably wouldn't go there, particularly if it was a -- a playoff game or something, you know, major like that.  Um --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I've noticed that is a change, um --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I -- I'm wondering you're in Seattle which is probably, uh, a little more laid b- well I don't know how much more laid back Seattle is than Los Angeles.  You've lived in the both places, um, have you seen any major changes -- have you been in Seattle long enough to see any major changes?
R:  Well --
L:  I mean, for example, you've got a space needle there are there -- are the security a little tighter getting into the space needle than it was three, four years ago?
R:  Um, the -- the last time I went, yeah, there's -- it's heightened security but like I -- well, like I said, the two -- two things, one is the airport -- well, I guess, three things, one is the airport but also where I work now everybody has to wear a badge and [NOISE] security will stop you if you have forgotten your badge and, um, what else?  And it's made me -- I always have to stop myself and say, "Am I being cautious or paranoid?"
L:  I -- I --
R:  That's something that has personally changed me.
L:  I -- I think that's true, um, I -- I know we flew into Washington DC recently, we -- we tend to go there from time to time --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  -- um, and I think that area which has always had high security, I think, now the security is, you know, bordering on paranoid.
R:  Yes.
L:  Um, I mean, my -- my son lives, you know, six blocks from the White House --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- so, you know, you're aware of those things.  I think we're more aware that -- that Washington is vulnerable, New York is vulnerable, um, Los Angeles is vulnerable but it's so spread out, I mean, there -- there is --
R:  Yeah [NOISE].
L:  -- realistically there is no downtown Los Angeles, I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like there is a downtown New York or downtown Seattle or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- downtown Philadelphia.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, there's -- you know, you've got these out -- these out posted Disneylands of the world and the Universals and that -- and the, uh, you know, the other Knots Berry Farm and things but they're so spread out --
R:  [NOISE] Yes.
L:  -- I mean, you don't have the -- the concentration.  I mean, they have a lot of people, they probably --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- have more people there than the World Trade Center has at any given time but, uh, again they are pretty spread out.
R:  I know that's -- when I visit friends and relatives I -- I h- have to reorient myself to remembering how spread out it is, you know.  But that's the only thing I don't like about m- m- my changes, like I said, it's -- I try not to get paranoid, you know, and I think it's --
L:  I -- I think everyone -- I think everyone is paranoid to some degree --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, I fly little planes and I am watching the [inaudible] airport and I'm watching the, um, security we have to go through, the -- the dance we have to go through --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- which, yeah, I mean, it was always a -- a -- a moderate level of security but now it's -- it's really ridiculous.  I mean, someone is really --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- afraid a little plane is going to take down, you know, the Empire State Building or something, you know, that's not gonna happen --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, uh, but they're concerned about things like that.  I mean, I understand that to a lit- little degree but, I think, there's too much paranoia and I think what else is happening -- what is another result of that is resources that a city might have, such as Los Angeles, the police who might normally otherwise be on patrol in neighborhoods or in -- in other areas, uh, are being reas- redeployed to -- you know, for -- for national security, to secure the harbors or to secure the airport or to secure, uh, the train stations or something where they normally be patrolling neighborhoods.  I -- I think that's something I'm noticing the -- the redeployment of resources.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And in Seattle you -- you folks are, you know, I hate to say a border town but -- but almost, you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- um, and I think you have -- you probably have something similar up there with, uh, you know, people coming in from Canada, you know, with there being m- more -- you know, more resources are being deployed, you know, for -- for that purpose.
R:  Oh yeah.  And, uh, [SIGH] I think it's good to be cautious, I just don't like it when I find myself, you know, acting rather paranoid and thinking things, you know, just getting --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, f- fanciful ideas because of -- of what's happened but I think it's good to be on guard.
L:  Oh yeah --
R:  I --
L:  -- ab- absolutely, there's no question that you have to ha- keep your guard up, you have to be -- I -- I think I'm more aware of my surroundings now than I've ever been in the past.
R:  Yeah.  And I'm less open and I don't like that about myself [LAUGH].  I used to be a very open person and now I don't wanna come across as inappropriately aggressive or I worry more about my -- my presence.
L:  I think I'm finding as a -- my personality -- I think you hit upon something here, I think it's my personality, I have less patience, for example, with telephone solicitors or with --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- uh, you know, people like that who I'd normally be -- I -- I won't say understanding of but -- but give them the benefit of the doubt.  Now, I simply say, "No, I'm not interested.  Thank you, have a nice day.  Goodbye".
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and I find myself doing that a lot more than -- than I have in the past.  I think that's true also for -- for human solicitors when I'm, you know, approached on things.
R:  Yeah.  And I think it's just one more indication of how stressful and how, you know -- things -- because I'm in my fifties and -- and --
L:  So am I.
R:  -- I remember how things used to be [NOISE], you know, and those are gone for good.
L:  Well -- well, I think so but -- but another thing that might be entering into it is we have a different economic environment than we had just before nine eleven.
R:  Good point.
L:  Um, you know, we're -- we're -- most of our res- -- we had -- we had greater resources at that time and we had the -- the dot com bubble and -- and I'm just wondering how much of what we're experiencing is related, you know, to the economic factors.  I mean, the State of California is, you know, thirty eight billion dollars in the hole and they're trying to recall the governor.
R:  Yes, I read that.
L:  [NOISE] So, uh, I -- I --
R:  I read that just the other day.
L:  So, I'll be curious to see how that comes out but again, you know, that -- that's part of the stress, they wanna raise the sales tax in the State, they want to -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they've just tripled the --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- motor vehicle registration --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- uh, you know, I mean, those are -- those are stressful things too and I'm just wondering how much of -- of the stress that -- that we might allocate to nine eleven is actually -- you know, is actually the result of other factors.
R:  I think there are a lot of other factors, you know.
L:  And we also just had a -- we -- we also just had a limited war that -- that -- that I found probably as stressful as nine eleven --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- maybe not as sudden but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- certainly as stressful.  And -- and I wonder, you know, m- my concern is -- is not so much nine eleven as it might be a terrorist or --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or someone doing something to a utility or a -- you know, an -- an atomic power plant, you know, if they could figure out how to get near it or damage it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, I mean, or the water supply or, you know, anything else -- a- any kind of poisoning.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Again, in Los Angeles we're so spread out it's probably less of a factor than it might be in -- in Manhattan or --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, Detroit or Philadelphia or something but, uh, I mean, Seattle I know has a downtown.
R:  Oh yes. [NOISE] Very definitely and then --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- uh, you know, with the space needle and --
L:  Which is a very visible landmark and, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- y- you know, you wonder if someone's gonna d- gonna make an attempt to take out landmarks.  Now, I don't think Los Angel- I mean, Los Angeles has got, you know, the Disneyland and the -- you know, that --
