L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  How you're doing?
L:  [MN] 
R:  I'm Shontae[?].
L:  My name is Gail, how are you?
R:  [MN] I'm doing all right Gail, and you?
L:  Oh, not so bad [LAUGH].
R:  Great, great -- how is your weather?
L:  Um, hot -- 
R:  Hot.
L:  -- a little cooler today --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- a little cooler today --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- yeah.
R:  Oh, okay, you're calling -- well, you're speaking to someone in Philadelphia. 
L:  Okay, I'm in New Jersey.
R:  New Jersey, oh, well, you know what type of weather we're getting then [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, exactly, we have the same weather, right?
R:  That's right -- cloudy, overcast [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and sorta breezy -- it's really nice.
L:  No, it is, it's pleasant.
R:  Yeah, um, I know we're supposed to be speaking on --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- the, um, [MN] the changes that we have made regarding the um, nine, one, one --
L:  Yes, yes.
R:  Okay, and if we had made any changes -- correct?
L:  Right, right.
R:  Okay.
L:  I would say, [MN] the first thing that sticks out with me, anyway, personally, is, oh, I am so frugal [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- with money, you know?  I --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I wouldn't invest or -- or put anything in the stock market, or -- or do anything with -- with ten dollars, you know --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- where maybe before I would of, you know, taken a risk, or -- or done something -- I just don't think that even now that our economy is -- is stable, and you know, I know that it's changed my views financially in what I'll do -- what I'll buy, um -- my car is nineteen years old and I'm -- I think I've been wanting to buy a new car every year --
R:  I understand.
L:  -- and, you know what?  I won't do it -- I won't do it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so, it -- there's -- there's -- there's kinda panic there, you know?  
R:  Right.
L:  How about yourself?
R:  Right, right, I have, um -- well, I ha- -- I have already been an investor in the stock market, and I really have kept my -- well, I've moved my stocks over into another area --
L:  Right.
R:  -- now, which is into gold, because that's a better --
L:  Safer, right.
R:  -- yeah, it's much safer now --
L:  Yeah, no, absolutely -- right, right.
R:  -- because the dollar bill's worthless, like almost, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so, they might start with this gold thing soon, who knows, but I know that's been mentioning [MN] you know, around on the market --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so, I have um, I -- I -- [MN] I am more conscious though of my spending --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- I -- I tried to lessen it a lot, I tried to not get into a lot of the um, credit card spending --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because that's, to me, is um, not too good [LAUGH].
L:  No, no it's not.
R:  You know, the interest on that has -- has gotten really ridiculous --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then, when you try to bring it down, they still don't want to bring it down and you might have been with them for umpteen thousand years --
L:  That's true -- very, very true --
R:  -- so ...
L:  -- I'm -- yeah, I'm proof of that, too [LAUGH].
R:  You know, and -- and I feel -- I just wish that --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, you are more conscious of what you're doing today --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you know, with a lot of stuff --
L:  [MN] But --
R:  -- and, even with -- when you're buying products, like, what you use --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's on a personal level, and on like, with the food that you buy --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you're more apt to look [MN] a lot at your ingredients, and [MN] you know, the f- -- just open types of ah, foods that -- you know, you're just consc- -- you're very conscious --
L:  No, [MN] very much so --
R: -- of what it is.
L:  -- I -- I have started to like, taper off my -- not taper off my work ethic, but I mean, I was down to just my one regular job, and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I tell you what -- the last seven months, um, up until about two weeks ago, I was working three --
R:  Mm --
L:  -- three jobs --
R:  -- okay.
L:  -- and you know what?  It just wasn't worth it, because I wasn't sleeping, I was miserable [MN], now I'm down to the two, but I can tell -- there -- there's financial panic there [MN] -- for me anyway --
R:  Yeah, it's -- 
L:  -- you know?  I mean, I -- I'm --
R:  -- I think it's all --
L:  -- I just --
R:  -- worldwide really -- [MN] you know?
L:  Yeah, I've been divorced for years, so it's just me --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and you know, my son is -- is twenty one, but still, it's like, I don't know -- it ju- just hit me in that way, you know?
R:  Right, right --
L: Um ... 
R:  -- and with [MN] -- with myself, I'm a single parent -- I mean single -- well, single parent too -- divorced, well, I'm going through a divorce, and suddenly that area too is another different -- you know what I mean?  You have to keep in mind now, one income.
L:  Right, yes.
R:  You know, not two --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and ah, it -- it's a lot -- and I just got a house [MN] -- I've been in this house since my separation, but I [MN] -- I've decided I was gonna buy the house, um, because I refuse to move again [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but, I -- I think I'm going to move again though, because I am, um, -- I bought the house for um, 'cause I'm -- I'm self employed, okay? 
L:  Okay, I am as well -- my --
R:  Oh, are you?
L:  -- my main income is -- yes, yes --
R:  Oh, okay, I'm -- [MN] I have an accounting firm and, ah -- what I [MN] --
L:  Good for you -- excellent -- I'm a, um, general contractor and hou- -- and housepainter [LAUGH].
R:  [MN] That's great [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- okay --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- so you should be busy.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I know, and -- and with um, what I did -- I -- I -- I did get another, um, I'm wor- -- I have a contract I just signed -- I have signed up, um, in Virginia with another company, too, and um, that actually started last year --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- but it's going to be on a full time, and I'm going to be working this business too [LAUGH] --
L:  Great, good for you -- see --
R:  Oh, yeah, and --
L:  -- that's making us two go getters [LAUGH].
R:  Hey, you know, you got to, because you know one income just cannot do it.
L:  No, right.
R:  On one inc- -- you have to have money [MN] to pay all these bills that they -- everything is going up --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the electric, the gas, everything, you know --
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- and now they're trying to cheat you on the telephone bills [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you gotta be careful on that, so, it's just money, money, money going out and you better make sure there's something coming in, you know.
L:  The -- the other [MN] way -- getting back to this nine eleven --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that I could say [SIGH] -- it's -- it's not that I wasn't loving and caring before, but I'll tell you what -- my boyfriend -- I've been with him for seventeen years -- is a pilot --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and, you know what [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, okay, okay.
L:  -- that coulda been him in that air --
R:  That flying --
L:  -- that day --
R:  -- that's right.
L:  -- and, he happened to be here with me, when that happened, and I'll tell you what -- I just -- just treasure my relationship --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- and my son, and everyone, and hold them that much closer and dearer, because that -- that had [MN] -- we're -- we're not going to forget this ever, you know?
R:  [MN] Never -- it will be in your mind for always, you know?
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  And you are right, as far as the caring go -- you appreciate your family a lot more --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and the people that are around in your circle, you know, everyone that God has allowed to touch your heart, and -- and, you could touch their heart, you know, and just blend and mash together, so I have -- I -- I have um, even with my clients, um, I've always been where they could call me at any time of the day or night or whatever, and they do take advantage of that [LAUGH] --
L:  I'm sure, I'm sure.
R:  -- yes, and I -- I tell them though -- you know, I'm -- I'm here for them, you know, especially if they're beginning their new businesses, or I try to encourage some of them to really start their own business, especially if they [MN] -- no, they're good in what they do, you know, and I -- I would tell them, "Well [MN], you know [MN], keep what you're doing, but maybe you need to reach out a little bit, for yourself --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- and see what you can do, on your own, and how much you can generate in business", because that's the -- self employment to me, I -- I would never --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- really, really go into an- another office --
L:  No.
R:  -- 'cause this company that I have signed for, I'm actually going to be doing my business with them here, isn't that nice?
L:  Excellent, excellent.
R:  Yeah, the [MN] -- the one in Virginia, but whenever they need me to come up there for the meetings, then I will go up there for the meetings, but like, I told 'em -- I -- yeah, I can do this [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like, for -- for the amount that they want to pay me, definitely I will do this --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- you know, but, um, I don't know, it's just -- nine eleven has changed [MN] a lot -- I think, [MN] people show a little bit more love to one another too.
L:  Yes, yeah.
R:  You know, they show the appreciation, [MN] um, [MN] you know [MN], I mean, you're here today and gone tomorrow.
L:  Right.
R:  You think about all that, you know?
L:  I think that -- I think we -- we all -- I mean, at least I did -- grew -- grew up with just this like, safety net, like whatever happened -- wars and terrorism --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they were just somewhere else --
R:  [MN] Right.
L:  -- they weren't here, you know --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- and now you know clearly that [inaudible] it's here all right, I mean, I -- I could see -- the smell -- I mean, I guess that I'm in Jersey -- I'm that close --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- so, ah, I mean, I feel like it was literally in my backyard, you know?
R:  Oh, I bet you could -- [MN] just really actually say, "Wow, this sucker was really -- it could have been here".
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  You know, thank god that -- I mean, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it -- it could have been more than what it -- it happened --
L:  Yes, definitely.
R:  -- what happened, you know, but, I -- I really do, I feel for the families of all of those people, you know, that [MN] -- 'cause, I mean, that was a total disastrous thing --
L:  Yes, absolutely.
R:  -- [MN] really [MN] sad [SIGH] --
L:  So, yeah, so [inaudible] yeah --
R:  -- but, I just thank God that we can hopefully, you know, [SIGH] just, not forget it but move on --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- in positiveness --
L:  Definitely [NOISE].
R:  -- you know, and rebuilding what they did --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- together and -- and -- and you just have to move on, you know?  But I know, we have to be a lot of -- [MN] there's a lot of caution that you have to take because you don't know [MN] who might be -- as -- as they say, around trying to harm you.
L:  Right.
R:  You know.
L:  But even -- even that I see as a positive thing -- it's because -- before I don't think you would [MN], not that I consider myself paranoid, but you -- you like, you said, just more aware --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- which is a good thing --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- which is a good thing.
R:  Gotta be more aware, 'cause I mean, we were walking around here like [LAUGH], -- "Hey, nothing's ever gonna happen over here --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- this is the United States of America", not like all the other worl- -- you know, countries --
L:  That's right, that's right -- somehow we were different, or so we thought, you know?
R:  That's right, but no, there -- this -- it can be touched, too, you know [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, ah, we [MN], like I said, it's made me a little bit more aware of -- of my surroundings.
