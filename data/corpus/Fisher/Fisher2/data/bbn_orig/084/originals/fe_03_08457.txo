R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Oh, I can't hear you very well. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I'm sorry. [NOISE] Hello.
L:  Yes.
R:  Is that better, a little bit.
L:  A little bit, yeah.
R:  Okay.  Uh, what's your name?
L:  Betty.
R:  Betty, oh. 
L:  Ye- --
R:  Uh, where you from?
L:  And what's your name?
R:  Uh, my name's John.
L:  And where are you from?
R:  Uh, San Francisco, California.
L:  California?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm in Wisconsin.
R:  Wisconsin, oh okay [MN].  Uh, so we're gonna talk about nine eleven, is that right?
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know, um, do you want to start?
L:  I don't know why it's so hard to hear you.
R:  [MN]
L:  Uh, it's supposed to be what changes we've made in our lives --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the topic.
R:  Uh, is this better [LAUGH]?
L:  Huh?
R:  Is this better, I'm sorry.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  Uh, well, I think we all, uh, realize that we're not as safe as we thought we were, huh, after that attack, don't you think?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  And that we value everything more.  I do.  Everybody I think, uh, [NOISE] tries to get more out of [NOISE] life each day.  The things we used to take for gr- for granted we don't any more and you feel the same way?
R:  Yes, definitely, mhm.
L:  Okay, well --
R:  I guess it's my turn [LAUGH].  Uh, it's just how it changed our lives, is that right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay, um --
L:  How has it changed yours?
R:  Well, it was funny because on the day of nine eleven, uh, I was watching the TV reports and everything and I just kinda sat there, like, you know, I didn't know how big of an impact it was gonna have until the days afterwards and like, "Oh jeeze" you know, like, uh, it kinda --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- opened my eyes as to like, yeah, you know, this is one big catastrophe that, you know, I've never really been through before, or America hasn't been through before and, um, yeah, I guess I -- yeah, it kinda made me value life more and, um, [LIPSMACK] uh, appreciate diversity more 'cause -- 'cause after nine eleven I actually wanted to learn about the, uh, uh, let's see, the Islamic people [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, so that's how it changed my life because I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I can't really say it affected me full, you know, uh --
L:  I think everybody was jolted out of their safe serene feelings we had about things like that couldn't happen here, don't you think?
R:  Right.
L:  And we realize now what a terror it really was, you know, that [MN] -- thinks that something could happen in our -- our country like that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I just -- oh.
R:  It was, uh, it was kinda scary because you know how, uh, um, after the nine eleven attack, uh, there were --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, terror -- uh, supposedly there might be terrorists activity in, uh, California [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, that kind of scared me, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, you know, I figured they might, like, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- hit the Golden Gate Bridge or something, you know, and that's like --
L:  I know.
R:  -- ten minutes away from me [LAUGH].
L:  I know.
R:  Yeah, um, I mean how did -- 'cause, um, let's see -- so Wisconsin is, like, Midwest area kind of --
L:  Well, not --
R:  -- or the middle.
L:  -- nothing too much happens in Wisconsin.
R:  Right [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  [MN] And I live in a small town --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I can't even imagining something like -- so horrible happening, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I guess it could happen anywhere.
R:  Mm.
L:  With those kind of animals running loose [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Um --
L:  I don't -- [NOISE]
R:  Um, mm.
L:  [NOISE] I guess that --
R:  Well -- 
L:  I, uh, I think it brought out in all of us a lot of our, oh, feelings for our fellow man, trying to help in every way we could, donations and -- and everything, don't you think?
R:  Yeah, well it's -- it kinda made me mad though I see some- you know, the, uh, some other citizens of America they -- they started taking it out on --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, mm, Arab- uh, people from Arabian descent --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in -- in -- in America.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  Like there were killings and beatings and stuff.
L:  [SIGH].
R:  And that was kinda sad, that's kinda disheartening. [MN]
L:  Yeah.  Well, I think --
R:  Huh.  Well, I mean, how did you think, uh, Bush handled it? [MN]
L:  Well, I don't know.  I think maybe he did the best he could do.
R:  Mm.
L:  Best anybody could do.  What do you think?
R:  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- well personally I think he's a moron [LAUGH] but, uh, just, you know, generally speaking but as for the war and what he did for ni- uh, regarding nine eleven, yeah, I thought -- I thought he did a pretty decent job, you know, trying to calm America and such.  Um --
L:  I -- I don't know if I'm sure if that was really necessary or not.  It seem horrible all the innocent people that died.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [several inaudible words] but I don't know.
R:  Mm.
L:  I don't know what to say on that issue.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I have con- conflicting feelings, you know --
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  -- you too?
R:  Uh, it kinda made me scared as to, um, you know, uh, 'cause they're gonna -- it's like, yeah, war, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're gonna declare war and are they gonna start drafting people, are they gonna take me, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Are they gonna take my friends, you know, it's kinda -- kinda scary.  Uh, my friend's cousin, uh, enlisted in the Marines and he actually got sent over to Iraq so I don't -- I don't know how he is or anything else. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, yeah, um --
L:  We lost a lot of doctors and nurses and everything around here.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, the hospital -- one hospital, Jesus[?], five or six doc- uh, nurses went so a small hospital -- made a shortage.
R:  Oh really?
L:  I imagine the same way all over --
R:  Well --
L:  -- don't you think?
R:  -- I -- I never -- I didn't know about that. [MN]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't know.
L:  I know my husband was sick a lot and I know at different places that he was in for tests and everything and there was long waits and everything because there was a shortage, you know --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- of the people working --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- there and they all said that they had to go over there, you know.  They were in the -- some kind of guard or something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- what do you call it, National Guard, or something.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] 
L:  So --
R:  Yeah, I don't -- yeah, Cal- I don't think California experienced that --
L:  Well --
R:  -- I mean, I'm pretty sure we sent doctors and all but I don't really --
L:  But anyway it is affec- it has affected every -- like I say, even this small state --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- has felt the affects of it in -- in ways like that, you know.
R:  Right, mhm.
L:  Yeah.  So, I can imagine the cities it must've been -- a lot of 'em went from there, you know, from the hospitals and everything.
R:  Mm.
L:  So --
R:  Um --
L:  It had a huge impact on everybody.  The scariness of it and the war --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and everything and then that other tragedy and I think everybody --
R:  You think it had -- did you -- did it have an immediate impact on you or did it take a few days?
L:  Huh.
R:  Uh, did it have an immediate impact on you or did it take a few days for -- for everything to sink in?
L:  [NOISE] Oh, I don't know, I think it took a couple of days to -- I think everybody was just glued to the TV.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I couldn't believe it, you know.
R:  Yeah.  'Cause I -- I sure know that it took me like about a week [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- 'cause I -- I -- I didn't -- I don't know I didn't, uh, [LIPSMACK] I guess I was a little bit ignorant because when I was watching TV I didn't -- I didn't think about the pe- people's lives that were lost and everything --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- until a few days later and they told me, like, the death toll was, like, three thousand or something.  So, that was kinda [NOISE] that -- that's when it was like, "Oh jeeze, this is really bad" you know, really bad incident. [MN]
L:  Yeah, I -- you think about but for the grace of god we could have been working there we were just put in a different place --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, but I -- I think it made the rest of us feel a little bit guilty that [MN] they had things so good, you know, an- and they had it so terrible.
R:  Right.
L:  [MN] And you just wished you could do anything.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I think the people really responded and still are, you know, to the needs of the people and everything.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, it kinda --
L:  I don't --
R:  -- made me feel bad, you know, 'cause people -- well, because I -- I was attending college -- I'm attending college and it just seemed like people were concerned about, uh, not going to class, you know ...
