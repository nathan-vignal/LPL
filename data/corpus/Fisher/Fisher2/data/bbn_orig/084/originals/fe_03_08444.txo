R:  Hi, I'm Carey.
L:  Hi, Carey, I'm Joanie.
R:  Hi, Joanie, how you doing?
L:  Okay.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  All right, what changes have you made in life since September eleventh?
R:  Um, I just think I've been more mindful of certain things.  I've just been [SIGH] I don't know I've just -- I've just trying to be a better person in general.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Just to, um, uh, be more open I suppose to other cultures and understand and be respectful of differences.  You know, I didn't just occur from nothing, that this was something that was building up or years if you will.  So, what changes have I made?  I don't know just -- I guess I've done more volunteer work.  I mean, I -- mm, I don't know.  How about you?  Maybe that --
L:  I don't really think --
R:  I don't know that --
L:  -- uh, that I have really done anything different --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I -- um, we -- I'm Jewish and my family is, um [NOISE] -- and my son became friendly with somebody from Iran.
R:  Oh okay.
L:  Um, about how many years ago, gosh.  Eight years ago.
R:  Yes.
L:  And at that time I really think I looked at Muslim and Iranians, um, which is still -- it -- you know, it's all part of the Muslim culture as people who quote unquote hate Jewish people or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- just be very fanatical and they're the loveliest people.  And because of that I don't really -- I -- look at -- look at people who are [NOISE] Muslim or from a Muslim country as necessary disliking Jews.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] Um, or, you know, I mean, there's fanatics with everything.
R:  Yes.
L:  And, um, I -- I can't say I grew up but I really have been very tolerant of every type of person, I don't care if they're gay or they're African American --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or they're whatever.
R:  Regardless.
L:  I've really raised my children --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that they don't see those kind of things at all.
R:  That's great, that's fantastic.
L:  And, um, not even a little bit and, um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I -- so I gu- -- aside from being terribly sad and really choked up if I see something on it or I think about it --
R:  Yeah, I think --
L:  -- I really have --
R:  -- that's it.  I think it -- yeah, I think you've hit the nail on the head.  I don't think it's so much, I mean, necessarily done anything different but just, yeah, not feeling -- ever being able to feel a sense of closure about the whole thing and yet, you know -- I mean, I wasn't near there at the time.  I wasn't anywhere in -- I was overseas at the time so ...
L:  How was that? I -- where were you?
R:  I was in Italy.  I was on a hiking tour so it was just very surreal.  So, I guess there -- there's a sense of, um, I don't know, being left out or not left out that -- that's so ignorant.  No, just --
L:  But no I can see your feeling --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's kind of like as much as it was horrible and gruesome --
R:  Just being so removed, if you will.
L:  Right and you didn't [NOISE] -- you also didn't a -- I guess, that -- when did you come back from Italy?
R:  I came back the following Monday so it was the seventeenth, I believe or ...
L:  And was you -- were -- were you delayed in your travel or did -- was there any --
R:  No, no, no, as fate would have it I was -- I was due to come back at that time so I just happened to be one of the lucky people and --
L:  And when did you find out about September eleventh?
R:  Oh, uh, it must have -- we must have been on our daily hike so it was around two or so in the afternoon at that time --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so -- I mean, whatever time it was -- if it was nine, say, when it happened it was -- it -- ju- immediately following.
L:  [NOISE] Okay.
R:  'Cause it was -- it was maybe six or so hours later.
L:  So, did you feel like you -- you know what, as much as it was horrible and it was gruesome and -- and we have -- we're in -- I'm in Philadelphia so we -- I have friends --
R:  Yes, I am too.
L:  -- who -- oh really?  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I have friends who worked in New York -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- I mean, I -- I would not wanted -- I would have wanted to, I guess -- I mean, just to hear it [NOISE] without being able to watch a television or -- in any way --
R:  Right.
L:  -- didn't you just wanna like [NOISE] leave the hike and go watch [NOISE] TV or pick up a paper?
R:  Oh yeah, I mean, it -- it's so strange because we were definitely divided in the group.  There were those of us who just wanted to continue on with the hike --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- as if -- well, I wouldn't not as if any- nothing had happened but just, you know, this was something that we'd planned and then there were those of us who just wanted to get to every internet cafe and just communicate as best as possible with those back home.  Um, and you -- and be [MN] glued to CNN and, yes, exactly.
L:  And which part were you -- which were you --
R:  Oh, I was definitely -- I wanted to sit and watch CNN, um, I had a -- I had a -- I had a sense of guilt, if you will, um, for being there.  Well, not for being there but just for -- I mean, we -- we had no choice but to forge ahead and, uh, so there wasn't -- I mean, the airports were closed in any case.  Um, but it was just very surreal, it was very, very odd.  Just doing this very relaxing joyous trip while this turn of events occurred at home.  So ...
L:  Did you, like, have a sick feeling in your stomach as though somebody got -- passed away [NOISE], I mean, here you are --
R:  Oh yeah, I mean --
L:  Now, were you hiking -- you weren't hiking in cities, you were hiking in --
R:  In Tuscany, right.  So, it was, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, smaller villages if you will.  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so it was -- it was very, yeah, it was very odd.  I mean, people were very -- I mean, the Italians were fantastic.  They were just, uh, very respectful and they just, uh, would inquire --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- and I don't think it was just morbid curiosity I really did believe that they were --
L:  I think it's [NOISE] one, of course it's a human being --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's like any -- and it does become surreal, it's like watching, I guess--
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the -- the flooding in China, you know, it's --
R:  Right, right, yeah.
L:  -- it's like you're watching a television show as much as you tell yourself it's not real.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And I'm sure that the Italians -- I think, truthfully, there's also a part of that's like, "Thank God it wasn't my country".
R:  Oh absolutely.  It was --
L:  You know.
R:  -- thank god it wasn't my country and also, let's be honest, "How will this affect my wellbeing as an Italian.  How will this -- I mean, what is there -- are there targets in Europe after this" or, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  So, that was -- that was an- on another level that was the current as well.  Um, so yeah, I mean, they -- they were -- people were wondering -- yes, how would that impact them and, you know, and their wellbeing and their livelihood and, you know, economy being, uh, what transpired, of course, afterwards.  But, um, especially 'cause that area [LAUGH] yeah, relies so heavily on tourism.
L:  Yeah, of course.  Were you afraid to fly?
R:  Oh yes. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, that must been so scary.
R:  There was trepidation, yeah.  I mean, not as much as some of my fellow passengers.  I never -- I mean, I'm also from a Jewish background so it was very strange, um, seeing so many people with rosaries in their hand flying [LAUGH] --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- back to the States.  Uh, but, um, no, it was -- it was just, uh, yeah, there was -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- there was an underlying sense of terror flying back, yeah.
L:  Yeah, I would have been so scared.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We were supposed to -- we took my son to school in Florida --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- um, on Sept- -- we had to fly back, uh, we were due to fly back on September tenth and I really wanted to extend it --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- and my -- my mother was like, "You just can't fly on September eleventh". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, sure.
L:  I said -- I -- and, you know, and the security was so beefed up and I really -- I love my parents and I respect them and even, um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- certainly even though I have a child in college, I still listen to my mom and my dad and I thought --
R:  L- likewise, yeah.
L:  -- I -- I really can't do that to my parents.  And I didn't but, uh, it was -- you know, I could see wanting to be in the country --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I could certainly see wanting to watch the news, like, to be in Tuscany where there were no internet cafes were -- I mean, if you were hiking you weren't --
R:  Right, uh, accept at the end of the evening, if you will, we would head to the back to the towns and the towns were surprisingly, uh, modern and had such amenities.  There would be -- there would be a internet cafe or an internet caf- -- just one and we would line up to use the -- the sole computer.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Did you stay in hotels then in Italy.
R:  Yeah, um, simple -- yeah, pensions -- simple, uh, simple accommodation.
L:  Well, that sounds like a really cool trip but is this the --
R:  Yeah, I highly recommend to you, the area's just very -- [LAUGH] very, very -- I mean, it's picturesque, spectacular, not to mention the food. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, of course.
R:  But, um, you know, and the people are just very warm.  
L:  Yeah, I -- well, I've been to Italy, although not that area and they are very warm, very nice.
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  Uh, god, I would've -- I mean, didn't it put a huge damper on your trip?
R:  Oh absolutely, absolutely.  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- well, also -- well I -- I -- there were people on my group who, um, if they did not work in the -- in that district, they knew people who worked in the World Trade Center so it was just, uh, yeah, it was just -- which was very -- was very, very --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- upsetting for many obviously --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for many reasons.  Um --
L:  Did [NOISE] anyone in your group have a cellphone?
R:  Yes, they did but it was hard, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- initially in any --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- case getting across the line.  I mean, it was just very -- and establishing communication rather.  It was just very difficult.
L:  It was very difficult, at least on September eleven, to get a cellphone call through --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- to in the United States.
R:  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  
L:  [MN]
R:  Um, I was just lucky that my parents had bought a computer that very same year --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so it was just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a sense of relief that I could communicate with them via internet.  So, that -- that was -- that was one -- 'cause they -- they live in New York so --
L:  Oh really?
R:  Yeah.  I mean, well they're in Queens but, you know, all the same I was just wondering how -- not knowing where they were at the time so ...
L:  You know, it's interesting 'cause as we speak it's not the kind of thing you think about everyday.  It's just the more I talk about it with you --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- the sadder -- I feel that horrible feeling of, like, of ready cry kind of like --
R:  Oh yes, exactly.
L:  -- you know, it's -- and I haven't for a long time but we talk about it and remember that day --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- and, you know, it just was, um, [NOISE] surreal I guess is the best word.
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just tragic, just --
L:  Yeah, it really is and then, you know, you watch what's going on in Israel with the Palestinians [NOISE] and I keep thinking all those -- you know, it's so senseless what's going on there because --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's like I kill you, you kill me.
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  You know, it's just let's trade -- let's trade funerals --
R:  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  -- and I just think --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- and literally it- it's so senseless and you --
R:  Right.
