R:  Rick.
L:  Hello.  My name's Crystal Anderson.
R:  Hi Crystal Anderson.  I'm Rick Locheck[?].
L:  Okay.
R:  You'll never remember the last name.  Don't worry about it.
L:  [LAUGH] Sure.
R:  How are you doing?
L:  I'm g- -- I'm great.  How are you doing?
R:  Oh, I'm -- I -- today's a good day.  It's all right.  Um --
L:  Okay.
R:  Well, so we're on this line to do a study in linguistics, which, my understanding of that is, ah, the study of language.  And I think what they're trying to study is how people communicate when they're total strangers.
L:  Okay.
R:  I mean, I don't know.  I don't know.  That's my best guess.
L:  Ah, yeah.  Yeah.  I figured it was something like that.
R:  So, anyway, how did nine eleven affect you and where are you calling from?
L:  Ah, I am from Texas and, ah --
R:  Like, I couldn't guess that.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  My whole -- my whole in laws are from there so I -- no, I guessed that pretty much.
L:  [LAUGH] Okay. [LAUGH] Ah, yes.  Um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] how did it affect me?  Um, hm, [LIPSMACK] I guess it brought a little more worry into my life as well as everyone else's.  Um, it ha- -- it really hasn't changed anything.  Um, I don't travel --
R:  Well, it did.  It changed a lot.
L:  -- overseas.
R:  We became a part of the world.  I mean, all of a sudden, we're vulnerable.  We never were before.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I changed a lot I think.
L:  Have you?
R:  I'm -- that's my opinion.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Also, I happen to be a retired, forty seven year old New York City police officer from New York City living in Seattle.
L:  Oh, how interesting.  Okay.
R:  And -- and it affected my life in the fact -- well, I had two old buddies die in -- in -- in the -- the -- the rescue mission.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Ah, it didn't really affect me [SIGH] a whole lot emotionally because I got shot on the job --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- years ago and got forced into retirement.  It's -- i- it's -- when you have that kinda job, y- -- i- -- it's, ah, something you need to expect every day, right?
L:  Right.
R:  So, I guess it affected me that way.  Um, but I think it affected me more in the -- in the fact that we're vulnerable.  Because when I was a little kid, I lived in France with my dad, right?  And -- and when you live in Europe, right, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you can have a -- a -- a diamond mine strike in South Africa that affects every port up through Scotland.  And there, news travels fast.  I mean, here, we're s- -- we w- -- used to be isolated --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- now we're not.  And I think that's what it did to us is that we realized we're not isolated anymore.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, that's my opinion.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Like it or not. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Mhm.  Right. [PAUSE] Well, it -- it made me, I think, m- -- a little more patriotic.  Um --
R:  Yeah.  But what is patriotism really?  I mean, you know, I -- I saw a lot of really st- -- no.  There's patriotism, which is a real thing, right?  I wouldn't have become a cop if -- if I didn't have that.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But there's stupid patriotism -- people running around with guns and flags on their car and ...  Well, okay th- -- it's not so much now as it was when nine eleven happened but -- but what I saw --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I saw road rage, I saw, ah -- I saw --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- all sorts of stuff.  And patriotism --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- should be as responsible, I suppose, as any other aspect of your life.  But when I saw these people running around, I felt -- I -- ah, there was a -- a thing I saw in a convenience store where people were sh- -- were pointing guns at each other and the cops came in and the flags were up and people were just not thinking right.  You know what I'm saying?
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  Well, you know, you y- y- -- [MN] you have to have the same respect for your patriotism as a- a- as you do your own life, I suppose.
L:  Right.
R:  Well, so that -- I don't know what we're proving to these people in the University --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of Pennsylvania but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- maybe we're proving something.  I don't know.
L:  I don't know either. [LAUGH] [PAUSE]
R:  Anyway, this is my third and final call.  I just had a little bit of a stroke so excuse my language.
L:  Okay.  I'm --
R:  Um, [SIGH] it wasn't big but it was just enough to, kinda, offset me a little bit.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  So, anyway, I think about my life and what I d- -- I used to be an actor before I was a cop in New York an- and -- and now I'm b- b- [SIGH] -- you know, now I'm just [LAUGH] toddling --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it by.
L:  [LAUGH] Mm.
R:  So, I don't know what we're t- -- supposed to talk about? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, ah, how the affects of nine one one have changed our lives.  Ah, I take it that they mean personally.  Um, and personally, um, I've tried to go on as usual.  Ah, I have not been anywhere as far as to an airport or overseas or -- or anything of that nature.  Um, we just, kinda, pick up and hope for the best and --
R:  Well, I, kind of, worry --
L:  -- move -- move on.
R:  -- about that too because, um -- seriously, because my mom just got o- out of the hospital -- she's eighty -- in New York and I'm figuring my s- -- my sister lives in France still and, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- she flew over and took care of all the business and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and did that stuff and I -- and I'm --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  To be honest with you, I walked into a crack raid and got shot.  It didn't bother me at the time but now, I'm scared of a lotta stuff.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I'm scared of getting on a plane.  I -- I'd, ah -- I'd -- yeah.  I just -- I just don't wanna put myself --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- v- vulnerable again, I guess.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  And maybe that's not the bravest thing in the world to say but, ah ...  You know, at one time --
L:  But it's the truth.
R:  A- a- -- well, how old are you?
L:  Ah, I will be thirty three this year.
R:  You're still young my dear.
L:  Yes.
R:  You're still young.  And just sometimes, you know, you don't -- you -- you wouldn't -- wouldn't -- when you're in your in your twenties and early thirties, there's still that belief that you're gonna live forever in some way or shape in your mind.  And then you hit forty seven and your life got destroyed and then you go, "Well, you know what?  I don't even like walking out on the street to go to the street anymore" you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I -- I don't know.  Nine eleven did a lot to me.  A- a- and so, I guess that's the subject of the day so [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] Right. [LAUGH] Right.
R:  But it was really nice talking to you.
L:  Okay.  Same here.
R:  And, ah, you have a good one.
L:  Okay.  Well, ah, I d- -- I don't think our ten minutes is quite over with yet.
R:  Well, I'm still listening.
L:  Okay. [LAUGH] [NOISE] [PAUSE] Yeah.  This is my third call too so, um -- I'm taking that -- that after our third call, that'll be it.  They'll move on to other people, right?
R:  Yeah.  Th- th- this is my third call in two days.  So, I --
L:  Oh, in two days?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yes.  I -- I figure I'm pretty much done with the project.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I was, kind of, interested in it because I did take a linguistics course when I went to college, right?  It -- well, it [LAUGH] was either English lit. or linguistics.  So, I said, "Well, I don't want English lit." so I went with linguistics.  And I learned a couple of things.  Would -- w- w- -- I mean, not great, you know -- but I only -- only took it for a semester.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, ah, they -- they taught us if -- in case we get cut off, I'll make this fast.
L:  Okay.
R:  They -- they taught -- they taught us how language b- began using the Hopi Indian language from New Mexico, right?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, they don't have a -- a past and they don't have a future.  It's only a present tense.  In other words, I'm not doing something tomorrow.  You just do it.  And so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it helped you to understand how language became evolved, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  W- w- w- when things were --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that primitive, they, um, [LIPSMACK] didn't have a -- a future or a past tense.  It was just [PAUSE] w- what's going on today.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, it was interesting.  That -- so that's why I got involved with this.  Ah, I -- I've never done this before in my life so --
L:  Okay.  Well, I got involved with this because I am also a secret or, what they call, mystery shopping -- mystery shopper.  And, um, anyway, um, I was looking over my post and it said phone calls.  Um, get paid te- ten dollars for talking on the phone.  And I thought, "Well, great.  I talk on the phone all the time, right?  So, I was, like, "This will be interesting" t- -- you know? I -- I really thought it was a joke at first.  I thought there's no way they're gonna pay you to talk for ten minutes and then actually send you a check.  Well, I got my first check, like, two days ago.  And I was, like, "Wow, they really are gonna -- gonna pay us --
R:  Well, no.  It's a -- it's -- no, it's a study.
L:  "-- to talk on the phone". [LAUGH]
R:  It's a -- my ex wife, she works here at the University of Washington in Seattle, she does a lot of this type -- not this type of stuff e- exactly but she does, kinda, similar stuff.  And I called her and I says, e- -- I -- I asked, I says, sa- -- oh, her name's Sandy, I said --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- "Do they really do this stuff and pay --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you for it?"  "Oh, yeah".  She says, "Oh, yeah".
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You have no idea what people are studying at any given time.  The gov- --
