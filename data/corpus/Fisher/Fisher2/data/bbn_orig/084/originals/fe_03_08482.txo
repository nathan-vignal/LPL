R:  Hi, my name is Mary, I'm in Boston.
L:  Hi, my name is Charlene, I'm in Kentucky.
R:  Hey, Charlene, how are you?
L:  Fine, how are you doing?
R:  I'm doing good.  [SIGH] 
L:  Good.
R:  I hate professional athletes and all the money that they earn [LAUGH].
L:  Yes [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Now, tell me how you really feel?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I'm really holding back.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't see any reason on the face of the earth, why they get all the money that they get.  [SIGH] How 'bout yourself? [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] I think it's ridiculous, the amount that they get, but I don't know where the money should -- should go otherwise.
R:  What do you mean?
L:  [SIGH] I mean, lowering tickets would be good, but I'm not sure that, I mean, if -- if the owners are making a reasonable profit --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm not sure that they should make billions either.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, [SIGH] I -- I don't think that the owners should be making the billions, and I don't think that the -- that the players, or the athletes, should be making billions either, I think that people go through -- through life and they can train and train and train and train to do something [SIGH], um, [MN] maybe a little bit more useful to society, like, brain surgery, or become a veterinarian, or a nurse, or [SIGH] um, a social worker, or, you know, give out low, um, interest mortgage rates to people --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that need things, [SIGH] and I -- [MN] I don't see athletes doing anything like that, I don't see owners doing anything like that and I just see them raking in all of this money, and sort of, not giving back a substantial amount to the community, or to the world, or to the -- to the US.
L:  Really, the community subsidizes them.
R:  [SIGH] Ye- yeah, exactly, it's [inaudible] -- it's --
L:  In truth, because in addition to buying the tickets --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- also, like [MN] often they're gifted with their stadiums.
R:  Yeah, yeah, exactly, so -- so, all the money that they make becomes even more -- you know, how -- how -- how much, um -- how many gifts can you, ah -- can you accept in your life -- boy, I wish somebody would put me to that test --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I -- I just don't see it -- it's -- any time that they -- that they threaten to go on these -- on these strikes, I look at them and I say, "You b- -- you -- you bunch of babies", you -- you know?  I mean, you're out there and you're earning millions and millions and millions and there are -- there are people dying in the streets, and there are diseases that can't be cured, and there are new diseases being discovered, and there's -- there is poverty, and there is hunger, and there's all this sort of strife in the world, and because [SIGH], you can get up and hold a baseball bat, or run a certain distance in a certain amount of time, or, [SIGH] um, you know, sail your yacht [LAUGH] ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH] And win a prize, or ride a horse, [MN] and -- and win a prize, or, you know, it -- any of that sort of stuff, it [SIGH] -- it, ah, it just drives me nuts, it's exactly what we do -- you know, it's like, um, [MN] like, the OJ trial and -- and him saying that he was gonna take his money and then look for the, um [MN] --
L:  Assailant, yeah [inaudible] ...
R:  -- yeah, for the real perpetrators of the crime [LAUGH], you know, with all of his money --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know, it's like, "Wait a second, why don't you, um [SIGH] -- not to be facetious, but why don't you really do that?", you know, if you think somebody else did the crime, [SIGH] then take some of your money and do that -- I -- I just um, I can't see it -- I can't see the celebs making all the money that they make -- the actors, the --
L:  The entertainment industry is really --
R:  That's another one that's --
L:  -- amazing, isn't it?  
R:  It --
L:  Just in general.  I guess sports are entertainment -- 
R:  I -- I, [MN] well, yeah, I mean, I -- I think that, um, you know, for me they're -- they're entertainment, but I'm not sure that everybody looks at them that way, [SIGH] um ...
L:  How would they see it?
R:  [MN] Um, I don't know, you -- like, you watch a professional athlete do something [SIGH], um, [SIGH] [MN] I don't know, I --
L:  It certainly doesn't [MN] -- I mean, it's fitness, but for them, not you [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  Which is something that, you know, like, I have four brothers and a husband [inaudible] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, some -- sometimes I think that they understand that on an intellectual level, but --
R:  [MN] They [MN] -- well, they [MN] -- I think they -- they -- they suppose or they, [MN] I don't know, I wonder about their sense of reality -- and I have a husband who says, "Oh, well, you know, you don't understand this, the real science or the real, you know, the psychological games that are going on here", and I'm saying, "All right, you know, give me a million dollars a year to play psychological games, maybe I would be --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- up to that", [LAUGH] I -- I -- you know, I just don't know, I can't --
L:  I think they -- they have an im- -- I mean, obviously they have a great deal of talent, because they've beat out a ton of folk to get that job --
R:  Yeah, yeah, but, but --
L:  -- and -- and I don't really mind people --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you know, if people are willing to pay to watch it, you know, people making a living doing something they're awesome at, [SIGH] even if it doesn't directly give something back --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you can give back --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- no matter what you do.
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  If you go about the right -- but, you know, millions is just crazy.
R:  People -- you know, people in -- in science have -- have awesome amounts of -- of talent, and education, [SIGH] well, let's -- let's focus on education --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- instead of the tan- -- instead of -- instead of talent, you know, I mean -- that physicians go to -- go to school all of their lives, and -- and they don't make, what, eight million dollars a year, and -- and they're out there, you know, saving lives, and I'm no -- no proponent of -- of, um -- of -- of physicians, but I'm just saying, you know, if you -- if you have a choice of, you know, standing on third base and -- and tagging somebody out, or [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- um, you know, taking a -- taking a lung tumor out of somebody and saving their lives, um, [MN] I don't -- I don't see where there's any kind of argument there [LAUGH], of like, which one is more valuable and if we're gonna -- if -- if -- if -- if our society would pay for what's valuable [SIGH] then -- then I can't see how they can -- how they can pay the athlete -- like, I wonder what would happen to -- to baseball, or football, or tennis, or -- or water skiing, or any of those, um, any professional sports if there wasn't the amount of income derived -- put up there for those athletes, quote unquote, to, um, to earn if --
L:  It would be interesting.  I mean, people didn't always make that much, and they always filled the teams -- but it would be a whole different, sort of, atmosphere, wouldn't it?
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, they know that -- that -- the, um, I don't know when they get together and they talk about your -- you know, the team and the -- and -- and -- and the club, and, you know, we're doing this, and -- I -- [MN] you know, they -- they fly on private jets, they stay at swank hotels, um, [LAUGH] they've got houses that [SIGH] -- [MN] and houses and houses that people would -- would -- would -- would dream of, [SIGH] and -- and we have people living in the streets, we have people that -- that -- that can't feed themselves, we have -- [SIGH] we have, you know, [MN] um, [MN] you know, people -- people with all kinds of diseases that can't get cures, that can't get help -- we don't have the -- ah right to medical treatment in -- in -- in the country, and [MN] -- and -- and -- and athletes can go out and earn eight million dollars a year, because [SIGH] --
L:  Because we pay them to.
R:  [MN] I don't [LAUGH].
L:  But, we collectively do.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, we could --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- we could, you know, as a society, we could fund research instead of going to ball games.
R:  Yeah, the government -- this is the party that -- that chooses whether or not we -- we get to fund research -- and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and um, I don't know, years ago I g- -- I thought to myself, "Gee, you know, if somebody would give me a tax form, and it would say, you know, Where do you want your taxes to go? --"
L:  [LAUGH] That would be lovely.
R:  "-- Do you want it go to the space program?  Do you want it to go to cancer research?  Do you want it to go to, um, you know, nuclear physics?  Do you want it to go overseas to fight a war?  Do you want it to go to -- to the military?  Do you want it to go to science and technology?", [SIGH] I thought to myself, "What a wonderful experiment in -- in my own head -- what -- what kind of boxes would I be checking off?", [SIGH] and I don't think that professional athletes would be any place on my list of things that I would check off.
L:  No, 'cause it -- it really benefits [MN] ...
R:  Who?  The athletes [LAUGH].
L:  Really -- close to -- close to [inaudible] -- kind of noone, yeah, I mean, I hesitate to say noone, because it's such a sweeping statement.
R:  It is, it is --
L:  But --
R:  -- it's too inclusive.
L:  -- but, it's close to noone.
R:  [SIGH] I agree.
L:  Because, even funding, like, parks -- even [MN] funding community teams would make more sense because of --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- how much of healthcare is eaten up by people being inactive.
R:  [SIGH] I agree, I agree, and that was one of the things I think that [MN] -- whichever one of our former presidents did, was to -- to, um, open up, um, you know, some basketball courts in the inner city, and -- and make them open later at night so that [COUGH] -- excuse me -- kids --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- would -- would have something to do, other than, you know, looking for drugs, or -- or stealing, or -- or --
L:  And getting in trouble, yeah.
R:  -- or, yeah, getting into trouble is -- is the right way to say it, and then, [SIGH] you know, somebody else comes into office and says, "No, we don't need that program", and it gets cut back, and -- [SIGH] and -- and then it becomes virtually nonexistent -- I'm not saying that the crime rate goes up [MN] -- on account of it, but [SIGH], you know, the athletes, their -- their salaries just keep going up and up and up and up and then they -- they have the audacity, the unmitigated gall, to say, "Gee, [SIGH] I'm not earning enough money", [inaudible] "I beg your pardon?", you know [LAUGH].
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, I don't --
R:  I mean, I go to Wal Mart to look for new underwear --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and you're ...
