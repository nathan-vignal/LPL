R:  Ah, my name is Fran.
L:  [MN]  Hi, my name is Gladys.  [SIGH]
R:  Gladys, I'm from Los Angeles, and you?
L:  [SIGH]  I'm from New York City, Manhattan.
R:  Oh, good.
L:  [MN]
R:  A- ah, did you ma- -- you should have made s- some c- changes, living in, ah, New York?
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Y- you mean, since nine eleven?
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, well those were security changes.  [SIGH]
R:  O- o- oh!
L:  But for health and fitness I have a gym in my building.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  And, um, I try to go down -- I'm not -- I don't have a schedule.  I try to go down three times a week.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  But I'm -- I don't keep with that, [SIGH] -- ah, I don't conform to that schedule.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  Sometimes I'm busy I'm -- I'm not able to.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  What about yourself?  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Well I -- I've made some changes, a- ah, since September Eleventh, [NOISE] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [SIGH] I've been more, a- ah, alert I think --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or more aware of ... the political s- scene.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Things like that, what's happening internationally.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  What's happening in DC.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I've also been a little bit more c- concerned about, ah, airport security.
L:  Yeah, but this is about health and fitness --
R:  [SIGH]  O- o- oh!  [NOISE]  Oh, okay.
L:  Not security.
R:  Okay.  Okay.
L:  That was basically, if you go to the gym how you take care of yourself healthwise?  [SIGH]  So, do you go to the gym +regularly and, ah, when did you start?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  How long have you been doing it?
R:  Since September eleventh?
L:  No, just in general.  This has nothing to do with September eleventh.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  This -- when -- they mean when we -- entered the phone call it's on he- health and fitness [SIGH] and they want to know if you go to a gym regularly.  If you don't go, [NOISE] why you don't go and how do you take care of yourself [NOISE] p- physically?
R:  Is that right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  I must have missed something but okay.  [SIGH]  Well, um, I don't go to the gym as much as I should to --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- be honest.
L:  Yeah, neither do I.
R:  A- ah, I -- and I'm feeling the effects [NOISE] of it.
L:  Right.
R:  Okay, because, um, I [SIGH] went to see a doctor... Monday --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- and my blood pressure is up.  [NOISE]  And this is the first time.
L:  [SIGH]  Really?
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  I -- yeah, I don't either.  Is it because of laziness time wise, ah, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- 'cause, with me it's [COUGH] -- I get bored, [COUGH] you know, excuse me.  I go to the gym and then I don't keep it up.
R:  Oh, okay.  I hear you.  Like, I'm going today ... and not because of this conversation.
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH]  But I'm going today because I'm getting my hair done later.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [SIGH]  So, I'm gonna do ... some, ah, cardio and then sit in a sauna.
L:  Right.  How --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- long do you stay at the gym when you go?
R:  Usually an hour and a half.
L:  [MN]  Oh, really?  What do you do there ... for an hour and --
R:  I do --
L:  -- a half?
R:  -- the stationery bike.  I'll do [NOISE] a mile walk.  [SIGH]  I'll do the --
L:  For how long?
R:  -- yeah, -- ah, I'll do the mile walk, that's about, um, fifteen minutes.
L:  Right.
R:  And then I'll do the stationery bike, thirty --
L:  But --
R:  -- minutes.
L:  Thirty.  [SIGH]  Wow!
R:  Yeah, and then I'll --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- d- do the -- the Stairmaster.
L:  For how long?
R:  And I'll do that for f- fifteen.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  And then I'll do some weight training.
L:  [MN]  Okay.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  I usually [NOISE] stay down about an hour and fifteen minutes.  I stay on --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the bike for [NOISE] twenty.  [SIGH]  The treadmill --
R:  Oh, good.
L:  -- and the treadmill for a half hour.
R:  Oh, very good.
L:  [SIGH]  And then I do different exercises for my arms.
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
L:  And, um, [LIPSMACK] and stomach crunches.
R:  O- o- oh!
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Ah, but as I said I'm not consistent.  I wish that every day I set time aside, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like, nine to ten, go to the gym.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  But I don't do that and I can't seem --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- to get myself into that -- doing that.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  It's very hard for me.
R:  I -- ah, I agree.  I'm with y- you.  [SIGH]  Gosh.  [SIGH]  U- um, --
L:  [SIGH]  You know sometimes it's very hot here in New York.  It's been very hot.  So, when I went down to my gym, which is in my building, [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- um, [NOISE] it hasn't been as cool as I would like it to be.
R:  M- m- m- mm.
L:  So, as a result I started to exercise and it was so warm I didn't think it was healthy, 'cause certain days it reached ninety six, ninety seven in New York.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  [SIGH]  And when it's that hot ... they say, you know, it's not really that good --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to exercise.  [NOISE]
R:  I can believe that.
L:  [SIGH]  So, um, I haven't really -- do you go -- do you belong to a fitness center or ...?
R:  Yes, I do, for years.
L:  Really?
R:  I used to go routinely.  That -- and it's, like, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- turning into a [NOISE] waste of money.  [LAUGH]
L:  I know what you're -- can you put a freeze on it?
R:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  I p- probably could.
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  And maybe I s- s- should.
L:  [MN]  What part of LA do you live in?  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Midtown.  I'm near Wiltshire.  Ah, the --
L:  Oh, I've been to --
R:  -- mid Wiltshire --
L:  -- California.  That's nice.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, okay.  And I've been to New York.  I've been to [NOISE] Manhattan.  [NOISE]
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, it's pretty ritz- -- it's pretty ritzy --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- out there.
L:  Yeah, well, [SIGH] there's different parts of Manhattan, --
R:  Oh, got you.
L:  -- [SIGH] you know?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Ah, I don't like California.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, why not?
L:  [SIGH]  Ah, because, you know, I'm not used to driving.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And I can't stand that you have to take a car wherever you go, --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and the traffic.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I mean not that the traffic is any better in New York.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But I don't c- care for that kind of tr- you know, when you have to get into your car it's so hot.  [SIGH]  This way I hop on the bus and I'm where I want to go.
R:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Well, I think --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- people who do the bicoastal thing --
L:  Right.  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] I think people, um, [NOISE] whoever designs the +transportation system [SIGH] they want to turn LA into this [SIGH] transportation ... mecca, if you will?
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  But I t- think that Angelinos, for some reason, l- love their c- cars.  [SIGH]
L:  [MN]  [NOISE]  Really?
R:  Yeah, I do -- y- you can't get them out of 'em.
L:  [MN]  Really?
R:  Really.
L:  Isn't that unbelievable.
R:  I- it's incredible.
L:  [MN]  How's --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- the weather there in -- in California?  I've a --
R:  It --
L:  -- I have a friend living there.
R:  -- it's h- hot.  [SIGH]
L:  Is it r- really?
R:  Yeah, it's hot.
L:  [MN]  Do you see any movie stars?  [SIGH]
R:  A- ah, occasionally I do, yeah.
L:  Really?  Who do you see?  [SIGH]
R:  A- ah, I've seen, um, [LIPSMACK] Angelina J- Jolie.
L:  Oh, how does she look in person?  [SIGH]
R:  She's very attractive.  The same --
L:  She is --
R:  -- way.
L:  -- tall?  [SIGH]
R:  Very tall.
L:  [SIGH]  Really?
R:  Mm.  Uh-hum.
L:  Oh!
R:  And thin.
L:  And thin.  I figured she was thin.  And who else have you seen?
R:  I've seen, ah, Travolta.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  He looks the s- same.
L:  Oh, I l- love him.  [SIGH]
R:  I do too, but --
L:  He's my favorite.
R:  -- oh, okay, but, you know who I love [NOISE] and --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- I've seen?
L:  [SIGH]  Who?
R:  I've seen Nick Cage.
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, I don't like him.  [NOISE]
R:  You don't?  [NOISE]  Why?  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Something about him.  I saw him on interviews.
R:  Mm.
L:  He's so -- he's not comfortable with people.
R:  O- o- oh!
L:  [SIGH]  He has this certain way of speaking.  I could never bond with him.  Never!
R:  [NOISE]  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  Okay.  I like --
L:  Ye- --
R:  -- Nick.  I --
L:  You do?
R:  -- oh, I'm a h- huge Nick fan.
L:  R- r- really?
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  He's a good actor but he's not one of my -- John Travolta is my -- one of my favorites.  [SIGH]
R:  Is h- he?
L:  [SIGH]  Well, he has personality.
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  He's down to earth.  He, -- you know, Nick Travolta is not -- [SIGH] I mean, ah, [SIGH] -- ah, the other one --
R:  Cage.
L:  -- Nick Cage, --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- is, yeah, [NOISE] he's not really my cup of tea.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
L:  [SIGH]  I love Denzel Washington, I think he's fabulous.
R:  I -- I do too.  [NOISE]  I love Denzel.
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, what an actor.  [SIGH]  He's so --
R:  I tell you.  [SIGH]
L:  -- [SIGH] and -- and, you know, he's so grounded.  I respect any of these actors that don't become so [NOISE] big and then they divorce their wives, [NOISE] and they bring all the children [NOISE] into the world.
R:  There you go.
L:  [SIGH]  Then, [NOISE] the nannies are raising them.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [NOISE]  I mean I have e- every respect- -- I have so much respect for these guys that just stay [NOISE] f- family men and grounded.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  I think it's -- I really admire that 'cause --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- that's so hard t do in Hollywood.
R:  I think so.
L:  [MN]
R:  [SIGH]  But, um, -- have you see P Diddy?
L:  [NOISE]  What's P Diddy?
R:  That -- that's the music mogul.
L:  Mm.
R:  But he's -- his home base is New York.  [SIGH]
L:  No.  [SIGH]
R:  He's, um, -- [MN] he's a multi millionaire.  [SIGH]
L:  P Diddy?  I never even --
R:  He --
L:  -- heard of him.  [SIGH]
R:  -- ah, yeah, [SIGH] he -- he's with [NOISE] Bad Boy --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Entertainment.
L:  [MN]  Really?  No.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, okay.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  God, have you seen any s- so called, a- ah, pop --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- culture ... type people.  [NOISE]
L:  Pop culture?
R:  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]
L:  L- like, who?  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  A- ah, anyone who's making the media, the press or anything.
L:  [NOISE]  No, I don't see anyone.
R:  Okay.  Okay.
L:  You don't run into anyone in the city.
R:  Oh, I hear you.
L:  Yeah, you know it's so big no one even pays attention.
R:  Probably not.
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, the one who I'd love to see is Jennifer Lopez.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, would you?
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.  I think she's --
R:  Any particular reason?
L:  -- I think she's [SIGH] so -- so attractive.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  And she's, [SIGH] -- you know, she's -- ah, I don't think her marriage is gonna last 'cause I think she's a bitch.  [SIGH]
R:  Okay, I hear you.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  But, ah, it's too bad because she has a lot going for her.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  But, you know, either way I can sympathize with her.  When they get so much [SIGH] so quickly, [MN] [SIGH] and they have people that just tell them how g- great they are and --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- that don't keep them grounded.  [NOISE] 
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  That's what happens.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.  Uh-hum.
L:  So, it's really -- it's a hard ...  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Well, she's a success story --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- don't you think?
L:  S- [SIGH] she -- oh, my God, do I ever.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  She is -- she's into e- everything.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  My God, she -- ah, I really admire her.
R:  S- sure.
L:  She's gorgeous.  [SIGH]
R:  Yes, she is.
L:  She has a beautiful figure.  I love her voice.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  The way she sings.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  U- um, I hope [NOISE] she's a nice person.
R:  [MN]  For some reason I don't get that impression.
L:  Y- yeah, I know.  [SIGH]
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  That's what I mean.  [NOISE]  You don't either, right?
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  Why it was in -- ah, 'cause usually in Hollywood they, ah, first [SIGH] what impression do you get, she's a bitch?
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [MN]  R- really?  I'm --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- not surprised.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And what about Sharon Stone?  What is this getting a divorce from her husband?  [SIGH]
R:  I- is she?
L:  They just did an article how happy they were.  [COUGH]
R:  W- what happened?
L:  [SIGH]  Lady, some journal had, like, four pages how happy and after --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- she almost came to death.
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH]  She's so glad she adopted this kid.  Her husband --
R:  Right.
L:  -- now they're getting divorced.  [SIGH]
R:  You're kidding?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I didn't --
L:  Pardon
R:  -- even know.
L:  I know.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  I'm a -- I'm a Stone fan.  I love Stone.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  I --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- did love her.  She said she turned her life around.
R:  Right, and --
L:  Will you hold on one minute?  [NOISE]  I just have to [NOISE] -- hold on one second, okay?
R:  S- s- sure.
L:  [NOISE]  [PAUSE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I'm sorry.
R:  That's okay.
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  I don't particularly, ah, I don't know -- I don't know her, you know, to really base an opinion, but I know at the awards she was always so glamorous.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  She looked so horrible.  [NOISE]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  She was such a beauty.  [SIGH]
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Well, [SIGH] getting back to gym work, y- --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- have you heard of the Pi- Pilates program?
L:  Yeah, I did hear of that.
R:  Okay.
L:  Do you like it?
R:  [SIGH]  You know, I really don't know what it is except --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for stretching, internal --
L:  Yes, I --
R:  -- stretching.
L:  -- saw it on TV.  They have it advertised.  [SIGH]
R:  Okay, well Sharon --
L:  You can buy the tape.
R:  -- Stone --
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  -- Sharon Stone does the Pilates.
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, does she?  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  O- o- oh!
R:  So, does Vanessa Williams.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, she has a beautiful fi- -- [SIGH] she's a beautiful woman.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.  Uh-hum.
L:  Stunning.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, really, they do the Pilates?
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  But you know what -- when they do it they have ... a trainer with them --
R:  Oh, that's true.
L:  -- [SIGH] s- showing them exactly what to do.  [SIGH]  Ho- --
