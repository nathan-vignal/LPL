R:  Hi there.
L:  Hi.  My name is Ashley.  How are you?
R:  Fine.  My name is Emily.
L:  I didn't catch your name.
R:  Emily.
L:  Emily?  Where are you?
R:  I'm in, ah, Georgia.  How about you?
L:  I'm actually twenty mile- -- twenty blocks away from, um, the World Trade Center.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  I --
R:  Are you from Australia?
L:  I'm actually from Ireland.
R:  Ireland.  Oh, okay.  I knew you had that accent.
L:  Yeah.  I've been here for nine years, you know?  So, how has this thing changed your life or has it?
R:  I reckon the only thing that I really have noticed since September eleventh is I really look around me, you know, more seeing what's going on.
L:  Yeah.  Have ever you been traveling on airports -- through, ah, s- -- through airports or anything like that?
R:  Well, that also changed too.  I was, you know -- I was -- now, I'd think about flying -- you know, I haven't had -- I've -- haven't been flying since September eleventh but if I was to fly, I'd rather drive.
L:  Really?  Yeah.  'Cause, um, it's -- it's k- kinda, screwed my life up big time.  Um, I mean, I -- I had just moved to New York from, ah, San Francisco and, ah, you know, it -- it's -- it's completely changed New York.  And even though I -- I'd people over from Ireland, we went down to Washington DC, and, ah, we went into a visitor's center, you know, like, a tourist information center?
R:  Right.
L:  And you go in and the- there's a shop to the left but before you, you know, pass the shop there's a, ah, security point, you know, for the entire building but it's not really part of the shop.  And we went in there and we just ignored the security [LAUGH] part and we got dragged over and, um, you know -- and we're, like, "We're tourists" and, like, "It doesn't matter" you know?  We look pretty Irish.  We don't look like terrorists or anything like that and we -- we just got hassled straight out of the, ah -- straight off the bat.  Yeah.  I think that's -- that's, kind of, a +little -- little absurd side of September eleventh.
R:  Right.
L:  Do -- do feel any more patriotic as a result of it or ...?
R:  I think during that time everybody was patriotic but I think it's back to, you know -- getting back now -- now to the normal side and --
L:  Yeah.  And what -- what do you -- what do you do?
R:  I'm self employed.  Um, I do a customer service business.
L:  Ah, w- what sort of business are you in?
R:  It's, s- sorta, kinda, like mystery shopping.
L:  How does that work?
R:  Um, I go in and rate customer services for businesses and tell them --
L:  Oh, very good.
R:  Yeah.  And tell them how they can improve.
L:  Right.
R:  What do you do?
L:  I'm actually a broker.  Um --
R:  Ah.
L:  That's -- that's -- that's why I -- I moved to New York.  I'm -- I'm a commodities broker and, um, I trade -- I trade currencies.  Trade the dollar against the -- the British Pound and against the Euro.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um -- um, ah, like they said, New York's the financial capital of the world and, ah, the- there's a lot of action here.  A lot of stuff goes down.  And, ah, it's a great city, you know?  I- it's -- like, I've -- I've lived all over the place.  I've lived in Europe, I've lived in London, Paris, ah, I spent a summer in Rome, lived in Australia for a year, but, ah, New York's, by far, the -- the -- the best city.  Have you ever been up here?
R:  N- -- I've been to Delhi, New York but I've never been up where you are.
L:  Yeah.  You should come up.  Is it 'cause it's a Yankee thing? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No.  Um, it's not that at all.
L:  Ho- -- I mean, how -- how far would it -- what's the drive like from Georgia?
R:  Twenty one hours.
L:  [NOISE] Twenty one hours?  Jesus, that's a long time, huh?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Seeing you don't -- seeing you don't take, ah, flights anymore.
R:  No.  I don't fly no more. [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.
R:  My sisters flew a couple a times since then and, you know, had no problems with it.
L:  Yeah.  It's -- it's crazy because, um, you know, I -- I flew, 'cause my girlfriend's from the Mid West and the company that we flew on, um, they used to have this, like, silver service, you know, y- -- when you got on the plane they, ah, e- everywhere is, like, fr- -- [PAUSE] ah, t- -- how long -- can you give me a second?
R:  Okay.
L:  Oh, sho- -- I can't.  I've got another call coming in so I think we're supposed to let it go for the [LAUGH] -- for the remaining ten minutes or so.
R:  Right.
L:  But, ah, hopefully, my -- my answering machine will pick it up. [LIPSMACK] So, that's about all.  So, how many more minutes do we have to go?  'Cause I can feel that the --
R:  We have to go eight minutes.
L:  I can feel the conversation drying up. [PAUSE]
R:  Oh, this particular s- subject would be hard to talk eight minutes so ...
L:  You think?  Yeah. [NOISE] [PAUSE] And, ah -- then there was --
R:  Have you done -- been doing this long or ...?
L:  Ah, I just -- I just signed up [LAUGH] for the hell of it yesterday.  And, um -- and, ah, you know, I -- I'm home from work and the phone rang and I didn't know who the [LAUGH] hell it was. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Have you -- is this your first?  'Cause this is my -- this is my virginal call, you know?
R:  [LAUGH] Here's your -- here's your call[?] or I could, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  Well -- why, how long have you been doing it?
R:  I -- this is my third time.
L:  And w- what -- what else do they make you talk about?
R:  Um, I had a -- the first day was on censorship.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And yesterday ... what was yesterdays ...? [PAUSE] I'm getting Alzheimer's 'cause I forgot what yesterdays was.
L:  I'd -- I'd be interested to see the linguistic analysis 'cause I -- I did that sort of stuff in college first semester.  You know, talked about syntax and how you structure your sentences and all that a- -- sort of stuff.  So, I -- I think that might be a -- an interest- -- if -- if -- if they actually, you know, send you out the results of your speech patterns.  I -- I'd like to see how they evaluate it too.
R:  Right.
L:  So, what's the weather like down there?
R:  Hot.
L:  Is it?  It's pretty hot and sticky up here.
R:  That's what, um --
L:  So --
R:  The other day they -- somebody said it was really hot and -- up there.
L:  Oh, it's been hot all weekend.
R:  It's been --
L:  I mean --
R:  -- like, a hundred degrees here every day.
L:  Yeah.  It felt like a hundred and ten.  Um, it was -- it was l- -- just, like, incredibly sticky.  Yeah. [PAUSE] Mhm.
R:  All right people, tell us that our time's up. [LAUGH]
L:  Huh?
R:  I said, all right people, tell us our time's up. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Th- th- this is, like, an awkward first date isn't it? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, what's your favorite color?
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, my goodness. [PAUSE]
L:  Mm.  Do -- so do you wanna sing me a sing? [NOISE]
R:  I thought you was gonna sing?
L:  Ah, what would you like me to sing? [NOISE]
R:  Whatever you wanted to sing.
L:  I'm not a very good singer, you know?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I'd be expected to get paid extra if I sang.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH] You know? [NOISE] So, um --
R:  So, how old are you?
L:  I'm actually -- I would say, mentally, I'm probably twelve but physically, I'm thirty five.
R:  Oh, okay.  We're the same age.
L:  We are?  So, when's your birthday?
R:  March.
L:  Ah, well, I'm technically -- I don't think -- I'm thirty five in, ah -- well, I'm thirty four right now but it'll be, um --
R:  Ah ha ha ha ha.  No, I [inaudible].
L:  Ah, you know, you're older than me.  It will be -- you're six months older than me -- me -- in September.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, um, I have a trouble r- -- I was -- like, for two years I went around everyone -- telling everyone I was thirty two, you know? [LAUGH] 'Cause I forgot I'd -- I'd got older.  You know?  But, um --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It's absolutely true.  And then it just dawned on me one that I was actually thirty four.  So, I -- seeing I'm closer to thirty five I j- -- I just say thirty five.  Yeah.  So, that's about it.
R:  So, in terms of September eleventh, then do you -- are you more aware of what's going around -- around you?
L:  Um, I mean, I -- my initial reaction of it was, like, "Those absolute bastards".  Um, because I -- like, it -- like, I live really close to it and I was working down there and, um, luckily that day, I -- I -- I -- I just moved in, I just started a job and my boss said, you know, "You don't need -- don't have to come in if you don't want to".  And I said, "Fair enough, I won't".  And, um, my girlfriend works i- i- in Jersey, which is across the river, and she called the house and she was hysterical.  And, um, she tends to overreact a little, you know?  And [LAUGH] she woke me up and I was, like, "What's all the fuss about?"  And, um -- and I thought it was just two little planes, you know, crashed into the building.  And, ah, I did actually see the second tower fall when I -- I was outsi- -- you know, our -- our apartment overlooks Sixth Avenue and the -- they closed that down and there was this -- just this big [MN] and then it was gone.  And that was -- that was really scary.  Um, and then the whole area, there was just this smell of rubble and smoke for about a week.
R:  Right.
L:  And, um, you know, you would d- -- just see, like, pieces of debris floating in the -- in the air.  You know, and I -- I think that the saddest part about it was that, um, people actually stuck up posters, you know, a- about two days afterwards looking for their loved ones.  And I mean, you know, it -- you didn't have to be a rocket scientist to know that no one was ever, you know -- no one was coming out.  Um, ah, but they still -- they -- you know, they would plaster pictures up, you know?  They'd have a photograph and a little description and their name on it.  You know, and I -- I thought that was very, very poignant.  And all of New York was just covered in that.  You know, I mean, it was just, like, all the walls, all the bus shelters, lamp posts.  You know, and I -- I thought that was, probably, the saddest thing that the people w- were a- -- in denial, you know?  There was no actual way.
R:  Right.
L:  Y- you know, it -- it -- it's the hardest thing.  I -- I remember, like, being on the phone, ah, with my girlfriend.  I don't know what -- it was really tough to get a -- a telephone line as well, um, on the cellphone but somehow, sh- she got hold of me and I was talking to her and she goes, "How's everything?"  And I -- I -- I just, was, like, "It's fucking gone.  I- it's -- it's -- it's -- it's fucking gone".  And she's, like, "What are you talking about".  And I go, "It's gone".  You know?  And, ah, j- just seeing the towers just, you know, disappear.  It was surreal because you didn't actually -- you know, you could, kinda, w- -- you could come h- -- you could come in and you could watch it on TV, right?  And then if you'd, you know, g- -- go out into the middle of the street and you're actually, you know -- it's just like what you've seen on TV.
R:  Right there wi- -- yeah.
L:  And that -- that was -- it was just the whole thing was freaky and then they closed Manhattan down --
