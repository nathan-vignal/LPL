L:  Hi, I'm Jason.
R:  Jason?  This is Lana.
L:  Hi Lana.  
R:  Ah, it was hard to understand what the, ah, topic of the day was.  It -- I understood it to -- to be, how do you feel about the high salaries of professional athletes?
L:  Yes, and the strikes by professional athletes as well.
R:  Oh, the strike.  I didn't hear that part.
L:  Yeah, the strikes and their high salaries.  Because I gather there are several athletes now that are threatening to go on strike.
R:  Why are they going on strike?
L:  Um, money, benefits, or they don't like the coaches they're working with.
R:  They want more money?
L:  I suppose so. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Oh.
L:  I mean, I guess my attitude about athletes that earn that much money is if you want to treat them as entertainers, then I suppose they could get that kind of salary, but if you treat sports as if it's supposed to represent something, it's almost like obscene to me.  So --
R:  It does seem obscene, but I guess it's just, ah, ah, whatever the market will bear and it's competition among the owners of the teams --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- to buy the best ones and they keep bidding them up higher and higher.
L:  Right.
R:  Which ah, is the way the market works.  But ah, I don't quite understand the logic behind the strike, but there's always two sides to every story.
L:  Yeah, I -- I don't know the full details about the strikes.  I know in the past they've had them because they felt that the leagues --
R:  They felt what?
L:  -- which kind of controlled the teams, you know, when they have the, like the baseball leagues, when they -- I think they had the baseball strike several years ago, and they claimed that the leagues were providing too many limitations on where they could search for new teams to play --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- on and -- and you know, they -- they wanted to be able to be more free agents than --
R:  They wanted a voice in it and they were being bought and sold --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and had no say so.
L:  Which is true.  They are kind of just bought and sold like, I don't know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, like cattle, but -- but on the other hand -- well, it's always this -- this paradox because on the one hand they pay huge salaries to people who they think will be stars --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but then the whole premise of most of these sports is they're team sports and I would think that it would be fitting if they were also rewarded for being a good team player, and I don't know that they always look at it that way.
R:  No, I suppose not.  And when it comes right down to it the dollar is the almighty.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And has the last say so.  So they all, ah, just do whatever they have to do to get the most dollars.
L:  Yeah.  And I've never quite figured out, I mean, the teams to -- to say that, you know, they're -- they're valuable and therefore they're willing to pay that amount for a player.  How do they determine the profitability of it?  Because 
R:  I know.  And then suppose they get injured.  I'm not sure how that works, whether insurance can cover such a huge amount that the loss would be.
L:  Exactly.
R:  So I never really followed it that closely, and I don't really watch the games on TV.  I'm not really a sports person --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't think most women are, although a lot of them do follow them.  Do you?  Do you follow the sports?
L:  I actually don't.  I don't follow them that closely.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I mean, the only sport I'll watch periodically is baseball.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But basketball and football, I guess in the winter I've -- I've never been that interested in sitting at home and watching --
R:  Well I always -- I always felt that, ah, football had so many intricate rules and regulations that ah, ah, it was just too, too much.
L:  Well I used to joke with my friends, the only thing I ever knew about football was that it always made Sixty Minutes come on later, and I'd turn on the TV and the clock would say three minutes remaining in the game --
R:  And it would take forty minutes.
L:  Exactly.  Somehow, with all the time outs, they -- they -- it would -- it would stretch out to thirty, forty minutes or something like that --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I guess, but that's probably part of the reason why, you know, that -- that the players feel they can demand so much money too, is because of the TV rights.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, if they are becoming like entertainment stars then they feel they can demand what Hollywood stars get.
R:  Uh-huh.  Sure.  They're -- they're as much celebrities as a Hollywood star would be.
L:  Right.  I guess one of the problems I have with that though, is it sort of makes people think more of sports in terms of the money.
R: Uh-huh.
L:  As opposed to the whole premise of teams and stuff --
R:  It sort of takes the fun out of it, and ah, if they enjoyed it before they became pros it becomes just a job and they are under extreme pressure.
L:  Oh, exactly.  And they become very demanding and it starts --
R:  But then it's work and not play.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, and I mean, you know, sort of, if -- maybe if the naive idealism of -- of wanting to say, "Oh, but we go to see it because it's --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- "people showing how you can work as a team and -- and that sort of stuff".  When in reality it's almost like -- like for show.
R:  Sure.  And then they become examples and idols of the young --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they don't always measure up.
L:  Right.
R:  The way they should.
L:  But also, part of -- that -- that's part of what bothers me is that then, you know, if kids are looking at them as -- as role models, they're no longer just seeing them as role models because they play well, but they're saying, "Oh, when I grow up I wanna earn that kind of money too."
R:  Uh-huh.  And then when they get there they don't know why they wanted it. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  Well it's sort of funny because I find, um, they actually started a -- a minor league team.  I live in New York and they -- they have a -- a minor league team they started in Brooklyn a few years ago, and I've heard those games are so much more fun to go to than the Yankees and the Mets --
R:  Well sure, I guess they -- they --
L:  -- because there's almost more of a spirit to it, um -- you know.
R:  Uh-huh.  More of a fun play spirit.
L:  Right.  So I almost see them as kind of like -- like independent movies, I tend to enjoy more than the big Hollywood things --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because they're all formula anyway, and it's like, before they get corrupted by the -- the -- the big -- big dollars, you know, it's almost they -- they're taking the game more seriously.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, as opposed to, "Oh, I've gotta look good for the audience", or you know, "Look like I'm earning my salary."
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I don't know.  I -- I -- I suppose if I were more involved in the games I'd appreciate more the individual players but, you know, when I hear that they're going on strike, I think, well, you know, they've just found another angle to --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to work out some more money.
R:  And then they have the head hunters who watch those little games too, and they watch the high school games to see who is in -- is tomorrow's star.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they try to scoop them up.
L:  Oh yeah, well that's always amazing --
R:  And get them in college, at all costs.
L:  Right.
R:  Whether they were ever college material or not.
L:  It'll amaze me too, though, sometimes they'll get recruited right out of high school or college into the -- the professional, um, leagues.
R:  Oh, do they?
L:  And -- well, it happens once in a great while --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but then I'm thinking, jeeze you're going to let this person sacrifice, you know, any future potential they could have in another career.
R:  If they're good enough, I guess they could do that.
L:  Yeah.  They can get the money now, um, and that --
R:  And then if they are in college, ah, how do they keep their grades up and play the game at the same time --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- when they're not college material in the first place?  But somehow they get through.  Some- -- by hook or by crook.
L:  Right.
R:  It makes one wonder.
L:  Well that's one of the areas I know that like, a lot of faculty get really angry because they see all the money that their college has spent on -- on um --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- coaches and teams, I -- at Indiana I remember when Bobby Knight was there, they would -- the -- the faculty were furious because they -- they felt that the -- the university --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- when they'd be cutting back in a classroom --
R:  It's money misspent.
L:  Oh yeah.  Then they said, "Well, but, you know, this is how we raise funds for the college because it raises our profile", and it's like, well, shouldn't a college be more about -- you know?
R:  And the college has to compete along with the other colleges and has to survive.
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  Everybody's trying to survive.
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  But they're doing more than surviving, I think, on those salaries.
L:  No, they're -- they're living comfortably.
R:  Oh yes.
L:  And -- and I mean, I guess that's one more way we sort of try to make them celebrities is well, look, here's someone who made a lot of money.
R:  Uh-huh.  Sure, back to the money.
L:  But I guess I don't know if that -- that deserves to bring respect or not, but um, it definitely seems to bring them a lot of attention.
R:  But you know, then when they're past their prime and those days are over, some of them really do run into trouble with their lives.
L:  Yep.
R:  They don't know what to do.
L:  Well, and it's interesting, there's only a very few of them actually even know how to save the money they earned.  Like, all this money that's going at them, a lot of them just seem to spend it, you know --
R:  It just goes.  Easy come, easy go.
L:  Right.
R:  If they don't -- and if they get the wrong financial advisor, they probably take -- take a lot of it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Some way, some how, they ah, get their hand into their pockets.
L:  Well that seems to be the big thing about these high salaries is there's so many middle -- middle men.  It's like their agent ha- -- and [inaudible] must get a percentage of it and other people who handle their money must get a percentage of it --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so it's just everyone's got their hand out, you know.
R:  And -- and the players themselves don't know what's going on --
L:  Well, all they know is they're -- they're getting attention.  So --
R:  Uh-huh.  And -- and they have to concentrate on their talent so they -- they can't concentrate on that and they don't even want to.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They don't want to be bothered with that, but then when they get older they wish they had.
L:  That's true, that -- yeah, that's a good point because I -- I suppose, I mean, all anyone -- anyone will tell them while they're playing is, well, you know, you help us win and that's a good thing --
R:  Uh-huh, and just keep --
L:  -- and that's all you need to think about.
R:  -- keep your mind on the -- keep your eye on the ball.
L:  That's exactly it.  Or you eye on the prize or however they say it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- yeah -- so.
R:  Yeah.  And win at any cost and take steroids and build up your strength
