L:  [SIGH]  My name is Carol Finkelstein[?].
R:  Hi, my name's [NOISE] Danielle Camacho[?].  [PAUSE]
L:  [MN]
R:  Oh, hello?  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  H- hello?
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] okay, I -- I never did it before so I didn't know what --
L:  N- no, I didn't either.
R:  O- o- oh!  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  I -- I don't know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- what to say because, [SIGH] a- ah, it was just very scary to me and I -- I don't know what to -- what I can [NOISE] think about it.  It's unbelievable.  [SIGH]
R:  Where [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- do you live --
L:  [SIGH]  I live --
R:  -- live in?
L:  -- north east P- Philadelphia.  [NOISE]  Where do you live?
R:  Oh, okay.  I live in New York.  [LAUGH]
L:  A- a- ah, people from other states, --
R:  Y- yeah.  And --
L:  -- that's nice.
R:  -- I was just curious.  [SIGH]  And --
L:  And in New York City?
R:  No, I'm outside the city, like, a- about an hour and a half north.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
L:  Wha- what's the name of it?  What's the name of the cit- -- area?  [SIGH]
R:  Um, I l- live ... near Poughkeepsie.
L:  O- oh, I heard of Poughkeepsie.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Somebody worked in my o- office years ago and she had visited relatives in P- Poughkeepsie.
R:  Oh, really?  [LAUGH]
L:  Mm, [LAUGH] y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  But, um, [NOISE] oh, my -- actually my g- good friend's husband died in the twin [NOISE] towers.  So, they were --
L:  Oh, God, --
R:  -- pretty --
L:  -- oh, that's so s- sad.
R:  Yeah, it is.
L:  I'm glad I don't know anybody who d- died in the twin towers.
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  So, ... I spent a lot of time with her and, you know, supporting her and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- [SIGH] and now she's starting, like, a foundation for it.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  So, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- she's making something good out of it, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I -- I suppose.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.  [SIGH]
R:  Anyway, ...  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  So, I don't really know what to say.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, as I felt very, ah, [SIGH] terrible about the situation but, you know, no -- nobody personally I knew [SIGH] was [NOISE] involved in it.
R:  R- right.  [SIGH]  Well, I think they also asked, like, w- what changes have you made.  I don't really know if I've made any c- changes [NOISE] b- [LAUGH] but ...  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, see I haven't made any changes either.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know what to d- do --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [SIGH] t- to do, I mean, [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] --
R:  [SIGH]  Do they --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- tape record the c- [LAUGH] conversations?  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  I guess --
R:  Yeah, --
L:  -- so.
R:  -- right.  Okay.  [SIGH]  But, um, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- um, I'm trying to think [SIGH] -- like, when I go to Manhattan I guess I'm more aware of, um, [LIPSMACK] like the presence of ... security or --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or whether there's not, you know, security or not --
L:  Y- yes.
R:  -- and that type of thing.
L:  Well, [SIGH] in any city [SIGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- ah, I -- I +worry too -- I worry too because, [SIGH] ah, if you -- I -- I don't go too much in the subway.  [NOISE]  And --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I -- I think I'd be -- I'm scared some -- [SIGH] I'm scared anyway in -- in the subways, [SIGH] you know, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [SIGH] what -- what's going to happen -- what can happen down there, or anything.  [SIGH]
R:  Right.
L:  And -- [SIGH] and so [SIGH] ah, then when you hear -- hear that the -- the [SIGH] buildings are knocked down a- and -- and people are bombing buildings [SIGH] from f- far away, [SIGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- ah, you just don't know what to [NOISE] think.
R:  Right.  [SIGH]  Yeah, and I guess when you hear things on the news now, you know, you think right away it might be something really ... t- tragic, --
L:  Y- yeah, right.  [SIGH]
R:  -- you know.  [SIGH]  Try to think of what else to say.  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, it's hard to think of what to say [SIGH] --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- about, ah, [SIGH] -- ah -- about the, ah, tower bombings --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or the towers.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  But I was a teacher -- well I am a teacher, but at the time, like, ... you know, we -- I was -- it was, like, the first week of school when it happened.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  So, ... it was just really weird the way I found out about it because I didn't really know what happened until ... lunch time.
L:  M- mm.
R:  That's when everything -- I mean, y- you know, pretty much everything was over by then.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, it was really [SIGH] o- odd, you know, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- like I wished that I was more aware of what was happening.  And [SIGH] they sent a fax around and we had to, like, [SIGH] read it to our class.  And --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I just didn't think it was very --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- appropriate [NOISE] the way the -- the, ah, school system went about [SIGH] --
L:  O- o- oh!  [SIGH]  Oh, no, --
R:  -- letting people know.
L:  -- I was watching the television and -- and -- a- and they -- they said something happened in New York and [MN] -- and then they started to televise whatever t- they could ... televise, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, what I mean?  So, I ... but then I -- I never dreamed of such [LAUGH] a thing.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  And, um, [SIGH] -- I don't know, in the news they have, like, up here be -- in New York 'cause, um, Guiliani is gonna run the, ah, next campaign --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- [SIGH] for, ah, the Republican Committee.  And they're talking about, like, you know, the safety issues but that'll be a year from now.
L:  [MN]  O- o- oh!
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  So, ... [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [PAUSE]  [SIGH]  How, -- oh, you already said you did this -- you didn't do this b- [LAUGH] before.  [LAUGH]  Oh, that was my phone.  [LIPSMACK]  Um, [COUGH] have -- do you, um, ... t- t- travel by plane ... at all, or no?
L:  I have --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- travelled by plane, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but not in recent years.
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  I -- have you travelled by plane?  [NOISE]
R:  Um, [SIGH] ... after that once, that's about it.  [LAUGH]  I haven't gone anywhere since then, r- really.  [LAUGH]
L:  What's your first [NOISE] name?  [SIGH]
R:  My first name?
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  Danielle.
L:  Oh, Danielle.  Mine's Carol.
R:  Y- yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  O- o- oh!  [SIGH]  [MN]  Oh, my -- [SIGH] um, -- [SIGH] ah, who is it, um, ...?  [NOISE]  Oh, yes, [SIGH] my -- my neighbor's daughter [NOISE] named her daughter Danielle.
R:  Oh, really?  [LAUGH]
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  Yeah, it's a -- a [NOISE] popular name now.
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  So, do you live directly in Philadelphia [NOISE] or ...?
L:  Y- yes.  [SIGH]
R:  Yes.
L:  Well, I live -- [SIGH] it's -- it's, sort of, [NOISE] out of -- a little out of Philadelphia.  [SIGH]  It's -- it's not exactly a suburb --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- [SIGH] but it -- it's called [SIGH] -- it's called [NOISE] Royhurst.
R:  Okay.
L:  It's -- [SIGH] it's in the north east Philadelphia.  [SIGH]
R:  Okay.  [SIGH]  So, --
L:  Do you -- do you know Philadelphia?  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Not really.  I've been there once a long time ago.
L:  O- o- oh!  [LAUGH]
R:  No.
L:  See, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't know Poughkeepsie, New York, [NOISE] either.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  I -- I [SIGH] I went to Manhattan, you know?
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  And, ah, -- and I -- I haven't trav- -- I wasn't -- [NOISE] I didn't travel too far around [NOISE] in there.  Only once in a while, [SIGH] a- ah, maybe four or five times in my life I was at Manhattan, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH]  So, I -- I just, you know, [SIGH] -- I know where Broadway is and all t- t- that.
R:  Right.
L:  A- and, ah, otherwise I don't know that much.
R:  Right.  [SIGH]  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  [SIGH]  I know I'm far -- I used to live closer to the city so -- now I'm a little further so it's kind of a pain to go t- [LAUGH] there.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  But [SIGH] ... [SIGH] are you anywhere near, like, [NOISE] the other the -- on September Eleventh a plane crashed in ... Pennsylvania but you're --
L:  N- n- no, --
R:  -- not near that, --
L:  -- I'm not [NOISE] --
R:  -- right.
L:  -- near there.  No, that --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it didn't happen -- and luckily it didn't happen in Philadelphia.
R:  Right.  [SIGH]
L:  It happened a -- away out.  [MN]
R:  Right.  [SIGH]  Mm.  [SIGH]  That's -- I'm getting a call waiting but I don't want t- [LAUGH] to [LAUGH] -- want to pick it up because --
L:  Someone else.
R:  -- I don't know.  [LAUGH]  It's like --
L:  See, I don't even h- have that.  [MN]
R:  Huh?
L:  [SIGH]  I don't have call waiting.
R:  O- o- oh!  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  But, yeah, I hadn't received a phone call yet so I looked on the --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- email and I said, "Let me see what happens if I dial the number" [MN] --
L:  And I don't [NOISE] --
R:  -- ah --
L:  -- have a computer.  I'm o- out of date.  [MN]
R:  Oh, really?  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  This is a -- [SIGH] I have to go look for another job now.  I'm --
R:  O- o- oh!
L:  -- in trouble.
R:  Uh-oh, yeah, I'm kind of in the same s- [LAUGH] situation.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh!  [SIGH]
R:  I --
L:  Well, you -- yeah, but at least you have a computer.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  I don't have a computer.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Yes.  What do you do?  Or what are you --
L:  I do office --
R:  -- looking for?
L:  -- work.
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  [SIGH]  'Cause I was teaching in the city and it's a big [NOISE] commute for me --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- so I'm trying to find something closer to home.
L:  M- m- mm, yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  Yes, that's what I would like to find.  [SIGH]
R:  R- [LAUGH] right.  [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  A job that's not too [NOISE] far away.
R:  Right.  [SIGH]
L:  But the -- they're hard to find.
R:  That's true.  [NOISE]  How far of a [NOISE] commute is it for you, like, into ... P- Philadelphia?
L:  [SIGH]  No, well I'm in Philadelphia, --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [SIGH] but, ah, to go to center city I [SIGH] -- I -- I don't have a c- -- do you have a c- car?
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, see I -- ah, people in New York have cars [SIGH] --
R:  Okay.  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I don't have a car,
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  -- and I'd have to take buses.
R:  Right.  [SIGH]  Well, ...
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- so it's harder to get around.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Y- yes.
R:  [NOISE]  Do they have, like, a subway system in --
L:  Yes, they --
R:  -- Philadelphia?
L:  -- have a subway system.
R:  Okay, yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  I told you I'm, sort of, s- scared sometimes --
R:  [NOISE]  Mm.
L:  -- in the subway system [SIGH] 'cause there are wild people in the subways too.
R:  Right.  [SIGH]  Yeah, it doesn't seem to be that -- [SIGH] and I'm sure it is bad but I remember when I was looking around about all different things in subways happening [NOISE] and I don't really [NOISE] see or fear that any more.  [LAUGH]
L:  Hm.
R:  More like crazy people in cars.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mm, y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Like somebody -- [SIGH] I was in -- [SIGH] I was in a subway coming home from work one time and [SIGH] -- [MN] and the -- [SIGH] and the guy, ah, he -- he -- I didn't get -- move out of the -- of the turnstile fast enough -- he [SIGH] -- he pushed the turnstile on my stomach.
R:  Oh, my God!
L:  See, so --
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- [MN] that's why I don't like to go in subways.  I try to wait for buses.
R:  Right.  [SIGH]  Wow!
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Mm.  [SIGH]  So, it [LAUGH] --
L:  [SIGH]  So, I don't know how long we have already spoken.
R:  I don't know.  [LAUGH]  I'm looking at my clock but I don't have one[?].  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I think we -- [SIGH] we spoke about five, a- ah, [SIGH] about [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- seven minutes [NOISE] already, I guess.
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  Oh!
L:  Oh!
R:  [SIGH]  I'm trying to think what to say.  [NOISE]  I don't want to -- [LAUGH] somebody keeps beeping on my call waiting but I don't want to pick it up.  I'll wait until [SIGH] more times.  [SIGH]  How did you find out about this study?
L:  [MN]  Um, m- my f- friend --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [SIGH] ah, I -- this -- this lady that I'm friendly with [SIGH] she -- she always comes up with stuff like this.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  She -- she -- [SIGH] she finds out about everything.  I admire her [LAUGH] for t- [LAUGH] that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  Because I don't know ... about anything like [NOISE] that.
R:  Right.
L:  And, ah, she came up with it today.  She said, "Would you like to participate?"  I said, "Yes, I don't mind".  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Sure, --
L:  [NOISE]  [MN]  Ah, ...
R:  -- sounds good.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  How did you find out about it?
R:  On the Internet.  [LAUGH]
L:  A- a- ah, on the Internet.  A- ah --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I mean [NOISE] I'm finding out everything I'm missing out --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- on.
R:  Right.  [SIGH]  Well, there's a web site called Craig's List.  [SIGH]  And ... they have, like, all these ... interesting [NOISE] types of jobs, I guess.  You know, things that you wouldn't normally find out about.  [SIGH]  So, ...
L:  What's the web site c- called?
R:  Craig's List.
L:  Oh, Craig's List?
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [MN]  Oh, see [SIGH] I don't know the first thing about anything like that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But if I had the computer I would but [SIGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [SIGH] right now because I'm not working I'm not a- about to spend money on the computer.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE]  And see I -- I -- I didn't -- [SIGH] ah, I'm -- I'm bad and I'm old fashioned, and I think that [SIGH] -- that, ah, Bill Gates is -- is too much of a billionaire by n- [LAUGH] now.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  And I think that [SIGH] people [SIGH] who are in [NOISE] trouble like me without a job [SIGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- shouldn't ... s- support Bill Gates.
R:  Right.  [SIGH]
L:  [MN]  But --
