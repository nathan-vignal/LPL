L:  [NOISE]  Hi, my name's Silvia.  [SIGH]
R:  My name's Mellow[?].  [SIGH]
L:  Mellow?  [NOISE]
R:  Mellow Levron[?].  [SIGH]
L:  Mellow, hi, where are --
R:  Hi!
L:  -- you?
R:  [LIPSMACK]  I live in Homa.  [SIGH]
L:  What state is that in?
R:  Louisiana.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, wow!  I'm in California.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, wonderful, my sons always want to see California.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  So, we're supposed to be talking about September Eleventh, what c- changes in our lives?  How did that affect [NOISE] your life?  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Oh, goodness.  [SIGH]
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  Big time, especially for t- terrorists and all that.
L:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  I couldn't believe that.  [SIGH]  I didn't know t- the -- they could, you know, we didn't -- our security was that bad that's the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- way I felt about it.
L:  Really?  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  Like, for the, ah, airports and all that --
L:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I thought the security was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- better than that.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Mm.
R:  But, of course, you never know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- too.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  You think they shouldn't have gotten through in the first place, huh?
R:  Exactly.  [SIGH]
L:  O- o- oh!  [NOISE]
R:  But I also --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- can't understand is, ah, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- like, with the war and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- all, you know, how they fought --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to keep --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the people out of our country?
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.
R:  [SIGH]  And they allow the people to come in our country now, take over jobs [SIGH] and all they're doing is trying to spy --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on us to take over us.
L:  Huh!  [SIGH]
R:  That's what I can't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- understand.  [SIGH]
L:  So, are you more s- scared?  [NOISE]  D- do you find [NOISE] --
R:  Yes.  [SIGH]
L:  and -- and --
R:  Yes, I am.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  'Cause you never know what, you know, like in the little town [NOISE] of Homa we live in [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you never know w- --you know, [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] who they could be.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  They take over the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- schools or whatever.
L:  [NOISE]  Are -- are you finding [NOISE] t- that your friends and neighbors are more [NOISE] afraid of strangers?  [NOISE]  Things like that?
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  Really?
R:  Yes, [NOISE] they are.
L:  [NOISE]  Hm.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  You think that our, -- um, the policy of this -- of the administration is good that we should have, [NOISE] [SIGH] um, gone to war with Afghanistan and [NOISE] Iraq?  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  That is a hard answer to answer.  [SIGH]
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  Because then the innocent people got to, you know, suffer for the guilty.
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  So, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's what makes my answer, "No".  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
R:  [MN]  But at the same time and, you know, he's got to be caught.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  But how, -- y- you know, go about doing it [NOISE] that's the question.  [SIGH]
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  Well, they've got like, ah, multi million dollar reward now.  I don't know --
R:  I know.  Right.
L:  -- whether that will make any difference.  [SIGH]
R:  I know but just think about all the innocent children --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that are getting killed because of it too.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, that's [SIGH] -- that's why I say.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  He's, -- you know, [NOISE] I don't know how that -- you would go about going [NOISE] after --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to get the man.  [NOISE]  But --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] at the same time when they're bombing and stuff and [NOISE] all, there are [NOISE] a lot of innocent people --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that will get killed for just like the Vietnam War too.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.  Uh-hum.  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
R:  So, no matter which way you turn you don't know which way to turn.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-hum.  Uh-hum.
R:  But it, -- you know, you got to stop the terrorists at the same time too.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, I'm just glad I'm not the President --
L:  I was just --
R:  -- of the United States.
L:  -- thinking that as you s- said that.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  I always wanted to be and said, "Well, you know, I want to be the first woman to be the President".
L:  Oh, good for y- you!
R:  [COUGH]  And because I said they should have a woman --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- up there.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I'd clean up this --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- whole United States.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But then when I see all stuff [NOISE] like this I said, "Huh, --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- I don't k- know!"
L:  [NOISE]  Big decisions.
R:  [SIGH]  That's so.
L:  Are you active in [NOISE] politics in --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Louisiana?
R:  Ma'am?  [SIGH]
L:  Are you active in politics --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- where you live?  [SIGH]
R:  No, I'm not and I --
L:  Not at all.
R:  -- no -- no more.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
R:  Because [NOISE] where we live at, believe in not, the, ah, judicial system [NOISE] down here is so crooked it's unreal.  [SIGH]
L:  Mm.
R:  And I don't know if it's like that all around the world, I really don't know.  [SIGH]
L:  Mm.
R:  Probably is.  [SIGH]
L:  Mm.
R:  [MN]  But, [LIPSMACK] ...
L:  [SIGH]  Well, ...
R:  [SIGH]  I was just wondering, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  --you know, a- ah, how much longer [SIGH] it was gonna be before, u- um, they [NOISE] would catch this m- man?  [SIGH]
L:  [MN]  [SIGH]  Looks like a long time.  [SIGH]
R:  That's what I say.  [NOISE]
L:  If he's still alive.  I mean he's --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- really gone underground.  The two of them have gone underground [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or they're n- not really alive.
R:  Right.  [SIGH]  But [SIGH] I don't know [SIGH] h- how much more killing they're gonna do to, you know, [SIGH] -- do this.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  I feel sorry for the [NOISE] poor innocent p- people --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] that have to go to war, you know, that the --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] the mommas and the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a- a- ah, daddies over here --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- have to lose their --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- children [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- for something like this.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  That's what makes me sad.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]  Well, then maybe we don't belong there at all.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Maybe there's a better way to handle it.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  I -- I don't know.  I -- I mean, I thought a lot a- after September Eleventh --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- about [SIGH] if I were in charge what [NOISE] I would have done and [NOISE] I don't have a good answer.
R:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Me either because the way they did it to u- us, [SIGH] all those poor innocent people that [NOISE] died, you know?  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And then here we're gonna turn around [SIGH] and go after him and we using the same [SIGH] tactics, [NOISE] if you look at it, --
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  -- killing innocent people.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And that's not right either.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Someone [LAUGH] had to go.  How to go about it?  I haven't answered that question yet either.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  So, ... because I can't give an answer --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I feel like I have to, ... um, restrain myself about how much complaining I [LAUGH] d- do.  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Exactly, that's why --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I stay neutral.  [SIGH]
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  But, ah, as a President [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- he knew they were coming [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and he avoided the plane where he got them to turn the plane [SIGH] because they were supposed to be coming after the President.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But when he turned the plane [SIGH] and he didn't go after him, they went after [NOISE] the building.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  So, to me, as a President, [SIGH] he was coward for the people.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  So, you can look at it that away too.  [SIGH]
L:  Well, that's what people said when they closed the tours --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- t- to the White House, too.
R:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  He's supposed to be standing up [NOISE] for other people [SIGH] and to me if you're [NOISE] the President when you take that oath [SIGH] --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you are willing to die.  To stand [NOISE] there and take bullets in you --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [SIGH] to protect the people.
L:  Mm.  Mm.
R:  But I don't see that.  [SIGH]
L:  Mm.
R:  I see them sending innocent people in the United States [SIGH] to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- go fight for them.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  That's s- sad.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And I h- [LAUGH] hate to say it [SIGH] but to me the President should be right there on the front line with them -- with the people, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] fighting because he took the oath to protect the country too.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  [MN]  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  So, that's what I would tell the President of the U- United States [LAUGH] if you t- take my son [SIGH] I'd say, "Yes, my son's [NOISE] going on the front line, but you better be standing right beside him too".
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.  Uh-hum.
R:  You'd better be fighting holding a gun, you too.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  B- [LAUGH] but, you know, they'd probably lock me up for that.
L:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  B- but it's the truth.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  But if I was the President I would go to the, ah, governments of the other [NOISE] countries first, [SIGH] you know, [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and [NOISE] make deals with them and say, "Well, we're gonna do this or do that".
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  But they're the ones that let the terrorists in our country.
L:  M- m- m- mm.
R:  They was in Florida.  [SIGH]
L:  M- mm.
R:  So, I blame the President for it.  [SIGH]  He shouldn't allow [NOISE] these people [NOISE] to come into our country.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But [NOISE] [SIGH] we're a free country so that's why it's allowed.  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  And now they're --
L:  And --
R:  -- sitting back wondering [SIGH] "Well, why are we, you know, getting, a- ah, terrorists in our country?"
L:  [MN]  And you know --
R:  They're the ones that's allowing it.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Well, letting ... these people in, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, our [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- yours and my -- I don't know parents, grandparents --
R:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
L:  -- um, [SIGH] they were --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- t- these people --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- foreigners --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- at some point coming to this --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- country.
R:  Right.
L:  So, [SIGH] um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I think --
R:  That's true.  [SIGH]
L:  -- we've always been proud of accepting everybody and --
R:  Exactly, and now --
L:  -- and --
R:  -- we're scared.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I f- feel it's not good at all to me --
R:  [SIGH]  Mm.
L:  -- to start ... changing that [NOISE] value.
R:  [SIGH]  Right.  [SIGH]
L:  [MN]
R:  But it's sort [NOISE] of scary now.  [SIGH]
L:  Yes.
R:  About, ah, who's coming into the country?  That's what's scaring people.
L:  [MN]  Yeah, but I don't want to be afraid of --
R:  Me neither.
L:  -- somebody just because they're from [NOISE] another country, or --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- 'cause their skin is a different color of mine.
R:  Right.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  That's not okay with me.
R:  Yeah, because and here [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- a- ah, if you're black or white or whatever, you know, you have a lot of racial stuff [NOISE] too.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Where a lot of people we -- we go by -- well, you -- how people treat each other not what you look l- like or none of that.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  But there are [NOISE] a lot of people that don't do that.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  They judge you by, ah, this and that.
L:  [SIGH]  [MN]  Well, they judge you by their first impression --
R:  E- exactly.  [SIGH]
L:  -- what you look like, how old you are, --
R:  Right.  [SIGH]
L:  -- what s- skin color, --
R:  [SIGH]  How you --
L:  -- how fat or thin you are.
R:  -- d- dress and, ah, --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- everything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They've always done that.  [SIGH]
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  But to be honest [NOISE] I find it's getting +worse.  [SIGH]
L:  Really?
R:  As the years go by [NOISE] and the kids --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- n- next generation of children grow up it's getting worse and worse.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  No, kidding.
R:  [MN]  I hate to see when my grand kids grow up, and they'll be adults, what it's gonna be like.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  But I do find the country --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [MN] like, a- ah, lots of -- let's, ah, -- lot of things, you know, go --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] and just laughs about it and think it's cute.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  You know, like -- just like a lot of parents do with the children.  [SIGH]  They let 'em go in the yard and, ah, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- don't give 'em responsibility --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and don't show 'em responsibility.
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  That's why the kids are growing up to be like they're doing.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Does that have to do with people working too much?  Um, you know, not both parents at home, stuff like that?  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  In a way, yes, [SIGH] but then in a way, a- ah, [SIGH] I say --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in a way, a lot of kids get rebellious --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for that 'cause the parents are not around enough.  [NOISE]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  But at the same time when the [NOISE] parents --
