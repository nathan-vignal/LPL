L:  Tanya.
R:  U- uh, hi.  I'm Patty.
L:  Hi.
R:  How are you?
L:  Okay.
R:  Our topic of discussion is -- is, ah, how our lives have been changed since September eleventh?
L:  Yeah.  I guess so. [LAUGH]
R:  Great subject. [LIPSMACK]
L:  I had a baby that was just born on September eleventh.
R:  Oh, congratulations to you.  That -- that -- that was a -- that was a -- that was -- must have been very interesting for you.
L:  Yeah.  It was.
R:  I mean, I -- I meant just in [LAUGH] terms of --
L:  I -- you know what?  I get a -- lots of comments from people when he was first born, "When's his birthday?"  "September el- --"  "Oh, poor kid".
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's his birthday.  What about the babies from Pearl Harbor?
R:  Exactly.
L:  I'm sure, you know, they don't care.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Th- -- no.  I'm -- I'm -- I understand totally.  I have a -- a very good friend whose son was celebrating his twentieth birthday on September eleventh and [NOISE] -- huh?
L:  You hear some comments --
R:  Oh, it was his twenty first birthday.  Excuse me.  I'm sorry.  Ah --
L:  That makes a difference. [LAUGH]
R:  And, ah, so that, kinda, put a -- a -- a -- a dent in that -- that particular birthday for him but, ah -- but, you know, gradually -- at lea- -- ah, did you have a boy or a girl?
L:  I had a boy.
R:  Well, your -- your son will grow up and -- and -- and not n- --
L:  That's how I look at it.  It ain't gonna phase him.
R:  He'll not -- he'll not have even known what --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- what the, ah, you know -- what r- --
L:  I look at it this way, when he starts school, it'll be a national holiday.  He won't have to go to school on his birthday.
R:  Exactly.  And he'll never understand or feel that terror.
L:  I'm honestly surprised they haven't made it a national holiday yet.
R:  Well, actually, ah, y- -- that's true.  I -- I d- -- I'm sure the day is coming soon.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  It will be a national holiday at some point in time.  Um --
L:  Too many lives lost.
R:  Absolutely.  T- -- way too many.  Um, but to be honest, I think that, ah, w- -- you know, what's happened in my life is that, um, from September eleventh up until this day today -- and I still say this -- is that my -- my TV, ah, seldom moves from CNN or MSNBC.
L:  That's how I was.  Now, with -- you know, I have a six year old so I don't keep it on when he's around.  With summer, it's not on 'cause he don't need to, ah, hear much about what's going on.
R:  Exactly.
L:  It scares him.
R:  Well, sh- -- cer- -- sure.  Ah, kids have to be r- -- very, very scared so -- so, in that way, um, I -- I'm -- I'm hearing that you're -- you're, somewhat, restrict- -- you're y- -- maybe, w- -- I mean, with -- it had -- e- e- -- ha- ha- -- if you had not had -- if you didn't have a six year old around, would you be watching TV more?  I --
L:  Oh, I'd be having the CNN news networks on all the time.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  When he was in school that's what -- all I had on was the news networks.
R:  Right.  Right.  Because you want -- you were waiting -- were we -- you know, it's, kinda, like, we're, w- -- ah, I -- I always feel like I'm waiting for the next shoe to drop.  You know, when --
L:  To see what -- you know, see what's next.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And -- and -- and we're two years -- you know, almost two years, ah, anniversary, which -- which tells you that, you know, we are -- I -- I -- I'm forty seven years old.  I mean, m- -- our generation -- my generation is, ah -- ah, is sh- -- is shell shocked.  I mean, we don't know who, you know -- w- we never have had to deal with this in -- in our, ah -- in our culture.  Ah, well, y- you know, what I'm saying?
L:  No one has.
R:  In this --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I- -- truly.  Yeah.  And so, it's just, ah -- it's a whole lot of stuff.  I mean, i- it's nine eleven and then the, ah, technology that takes you right there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, I mean, it's in your living room, ah, every day.  And -- and it's, ah -- it's a- -- it's certainly -- it's affected my life.  I -- my level of anxiety, ah, went up a great deal after that.  Just in -- and there, ah -- you know, there was some mild depression.  You know, days when -- when I was blue, maybe didn't understand why.  And I -- I don't think it w- -- I don't know what part of the country you're in ...  A- --
L:  I'm in Ohio.
R:  Mm. [MN] Florida here, but [MN] -- but it's not just, you know -- it wasn't just the people in and around New York.
L:  No.  It affected everybody.
R:  It affected everybody.
L:  Whether you knew someone or not.  Now, I knew -- I knew someone -- not personally, it was a family member that I've never met -- who was on one of the planes.
R:  Oh, my.
L:  So, you know, we feel it in our family.
R:  Of course.
L:  I mean, I never met them 'cause they did live far away.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm
L:  But, you know --
R:  I don't think I've spoke to anybody clo- -- ah, that's close to me that doesn't -- didn't know someone or know someone who knew someone that was [MN] somehow involved.
L:  Exactly.  With all them lives.
R:  With all the -- with all that, which just, you know -- this is j- -- it was just a b- -- [LAUGH] -- it was a big darn deal and it -- it was -- it's -- it was -- it's tragic.  And, um -- and w- -- I don- -- I don't know in a -- in a way w- -- our country, I think we're forever changed.
L:  A- -- mm.  We're more cautious than we were before.
R:  Absolutely.  More cautious.  Um, somehow, ah, less, ah, innocent --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in our -- in our ways of thinking about -- you know, it's not just, you know, when you think, "I'm gonna go to the football game or the baseball game or a big stadium concert" anymore.  Y- you know, that's -- that somehow, creeps into your mind as part of a, ah -- you know?
L:  Exactly.  I just went to a concert last month and they had us go through the, um, detectors.  You know, they had the, um --
R:  Right.
L:  Not just, you know, the old detectors, you know, the, um -- the ones where they w- -- you know, have the wand.
R:  Good.  Yeah.  Well, good.
L:  I was, like, "Wow, this has really changed". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It sure has changed.  I mean -- y- yeah.  I mean, when that -- that just beco- becomes, um -- or -- or now, I find myself actually saying to my -- saying, ah, y- -- ah, even on holidays, ah, on days when we know that w- -- you know, will be big shopping days in public places or, you know, big, large public crowds, w- -- do we -- do we -- you know, depending on what we're hearing on the news, you know?  Depending on how high, ah -- yeah.  I don't wanna come off as sounding paranoid, um, but depending on what we're hearing in the news it's, like --
L:  Exactly.
R:  It's, like, ah, do we -- do we wanna go or not?  Is it worth -- is it worth, um, p- -- a possible problem?  And, ah, av- -- ah, I -- I'm in, ah -- I'm in Florida -- I'm in Tampa, Florida, or near Tampa, near MacDill Air Force Base and, um -- and sometimes, um, things get a little hairy around here too.  Just, you know, with local -- local scares, you know, that go on.
L:  Yeah.  I remember they were over here.  I'm in Cleveland.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That had, ah -- for the city, they put the risk on high because one of the planes went overhead us before it went to p- -- you know, the one that landed in PA?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  It was over -- over us.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And for that -- ah, for the -- for, like, a week they had us on high security warning here.
R:  Absolutely.  Well, you were probably on a high security alert right that -- at that moment.  Beca- --
L:  That's possible.
R:  Well, I'm sure.  Ah, from --
L:  You know --
R:  Ah, from Cleveland to where they -- where they crashed in Pennsylvania, my guess is that that was probably within a few short minutes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because, um -- you know?
L:  Yeah.  They had us on high -- high warning for a while.  Lot of businesses closed for the week.  Like, where I worked --
R:  Right.
L:  I work in a restaurant.
R:  Right.
L:  We closed our business for two weeks.
R:  Wow.
L:  We were near hotels.  We were -- where I -- where I worked was right by Cleveland Airport.
R:  So, because the airport was w- -- the airports were really, just, kaput.  Ah --
L:  Yeah.  So, they decided to close.
R:  Everything was at a stan- -- yeah.  Well, not -- you know, that's a -- it's just a -- a- and -- and there was that sudden impact on -- on that economy, on --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- on -- on -- on any business that -- that -- that revolves around people coming and going in that way.  Absolutely.  It's tough.  It was a tough, tough time. [PAUSE] Are you there still?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.  I thought they c- -- disconnected us [LAUGH].  My apologies.
L:  No.  There for a minute, I thought the same thing.  It's, like, "Wait, they normally say something first".
R:  Yeah.  I, ah -- this is the, ah -- my second time doing -- do- -- participating with this.
L:  This is actually my third.  I hope they call again.  It's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's interesting to hear what other people have to say.
R:  Yeah.  Well, this is, ah, the first, ah -- yes, it is.  Always very interesting and you get to talk to a lot of people.  It's nice.  It's a good deal.  Um, so back to nine eleven. [PAUSE] What, um -- how it has changed my life?  Just, more cautious.  Absolutely.  And -- and you already said it. [PAUSE]
L:  Nothing will be the same.
R:  No.
L:  M- --
R:  But -- but -- but we're more hopeful.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I mean, we're m- -- I mean, we're less, ah -- less -- less depressed.
L:  Yeah.  Well, none of us are like we were last year at this time.
R:  No.  We were, kinda, like, in a f- f- -- it was like in a fog -- in a haze for quite a long time and then, you know, I think it's just --
L:  M- --
R:  -- it was a gradual, ah, coming, ah -- you know, coming out of a shock.  A- --
L:  And that'll be one day all of us remember what we were doing.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  We will know.  I know exac- -- [LAUGH] we'll always know how -- what I was doing that morning.  There isn't anyone in the world who won't remember that.
L:  I remember I woke up -- we were running late taking my son to kindergarten -- woke up -- I'd taken him to school -- hearing it on the news.  I was, like, "Wait, is this a dream?"
R:  Really?
L:  "Am I still asleep?"
R:  Yeah.  Yep.  We were waking up and, ah, turned on, ah, the w- -- we leave the TV on at night -- it's, kinda, like a permanent night light -- and I woke up ab- about, you know, at -- at just ab- -- just at that time and I -- I -- I -- I looked at my partner, I said, "What the -- what's going on?"  You know?  And it was r- --
L:  It was like a nightmare movie.
R:  It was.  It was like happening in slow motion.  Wat- --
