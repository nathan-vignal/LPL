L:  Ah, Matt.
R:  Hi.  I'm Draya.  Where are you from?
L:  Ah, Philadelphia.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm -- I lived in Connecticut for a while but I'm in -- down in Virginia right now.
L:  Oh, okay.  Cool.
R:  Yeah.  So, what, um -- what were your, like, reactions during September eleventh?
L:  Um, [LAUGH] I guess, like ...  I don't know.  Like, I -- I was at a college when it happened.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, like, I -- I, kind of, woke up in the morning a- -- or my roommate woke me up at, like, eight thirty.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And his dad lives in New York and he was, like -- he was, like, ah, "Matt, like, a plane just hit the -- one of the World Trade Centers" and I was, like, "Oh, that's weird".  Like, and I just went to, like, class. [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.
L:  So, [LAUGH] like, I thought it was, like, an accident and then I got back, like, two hours later and everyone's, like -- like, "The buildings are gone".  I was, like, "They're gone?  What do you mean they're gone?" [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my god. [LAUGH]
L:  So, [LAUGH] like, ah -- like, we went upstairs and, like, lot- -- like, everyone was watching TV, like, in the lounge and, like -- like, people were crying and stuff.  And, like -- I don't know.  It was, like, pretty, like, disturbing and, like, r- -- upsetting obviously but a, like -- a part of if was just, like -- like, total, like disbelief and, like -- like, awe, you know?  Like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because you're just, like, looking at this on the TV, like -- like, "Is this real?" [LAUGH]
R:  It was like a movie, right?  Like, it almost seemed like, you know, just way, like, too much for it to be real.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, I couldn't believe if at first because I saw it on TV, obviously, first and I was, like, that -- it can't be happening.  I was not about to accept that ha- had just happened, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And you say your dad was in New York?
L:  Oh, my -- my roommate's dad.  Yeah.
R:  Oh, your roommate's dad?  Wa- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Was he okay?
L:  Yeah.  He was fine.  Like --
R:  That's good.
L:  He was f- -- I didn't -- I actually -- I didn't really know anyone that was, like, um, killed in it.  Like, um, when I was at, like -- the college I went to was upstate New York and, like, a lot of the kids were from Manhattan.  Like, a lot of my --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- best friends were from Manhattan and none of them -- or, ah -- like, none of them lost their parents.  There was -- I think there was one girl from the school that -- that lost, like, a -- a close family member.  A- --
R:  Wow.
L:  And, so that --
R:  And what -- what school in New York is it?
L:  Um, Bard College.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow.  That's crazy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Are you -- do you still go there?
L:  No.  I don't go there anymore.  I -- I'm not going to school right now.  I'm just, um -- like, I -- I live, like, in South Philadelphia now and I'm just, kinda, working and maybe gonna go back.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But --
R:  And do you, like -- do you -- do you fly?  Um, because I know that some people refuse to fly, you know, because -- I mean, either because of the lo- -- like, long lines and, like, the hassle or just because, like, you know, they're just scared.  Like -- did I t- -- like, how did it change you?
L:  Oh, I mean, ah -- I -- I actually, like, I -- I, kinda, like that it's changed that aspect of, like, our world 'cause now, like, flights are cheaper. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, I -- I wanna, kinda, go to Europe.  Like, I'd -- I really am not afraid to fly at all so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, I'm gonna -- I, kinda, like -- I don't know. [LAUGH] Hopefully, I can get some cheap flights somewhere.
R:  Yeah.  I know what you mean.  I'm not really scared of flying either.  Like, the only hassle is, like, the long lines but at the same time, it really doesn't matter because, I mean, if it's gonna increase security then, by all means, do it.  The only thing that I think is ridiculous is, you know, we have nail clippers and, like, they take 'em away.  Honestly, how -- what harm can you possibly do with a nail clipper?
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Really. [LAUGH]
R:  Like, my friend, like, they threw his away.  They're, like, "We're sorry, you can't take those on the plane".  He was, like, "What?" [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.  That's pretty absurd.
R:  Have you been to, um, New York City, like, the World Trade Center afterwards?  Like, Ground Zero and everything?
L:  Um, I've been to Manhattan a bunch of times and I've never gone to see it.  I just, like, have no interest really. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Seeing it.  I mean, it, like -- I saw it enough on -- on TV. [LAUGH] I don't really need to, like, go there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So -- but I mean -- I don't know.  Ah --
R:  Yeah.  Once they're, like -- well, actually, 'cause we lived in Connecticut, like I said, and I was, ah, senior in high school when it happened.  So, a bunch of our friends just, kinda, drove there and took a train to, you know, downtown.  And there was crazy people, like, blocks and blocks and blocks, like -- you know, how, like, they built that ramp and there's people waiting to go on the ramp.  Like, we were gonna do it but we're, like, "Okay, this is, kind of, a little too long and we have to go back home".  But --
L:  Yeah.
R:  There was so many people there.  Like, it touched, like, w- -- you know, so many lives and in a way, I think it was, kinda, good because, like, I guess it, kind of, united people, you know?  Like, despite of, like, people's differences and stuff.  But at the -- oh, on the other hand, you also have people who, you know, hated the Muslims and stuff like that, which is very unfair, you know?  Because it's such a small percentage of, you know, crazed, like, religion fanatics who --
L:  Is --
R:  -- did, you know, that terrorism acts and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they're not really representing, like, a whole entire religion.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that was, kinda, crazy.  Like, to hear some stories about, you know, like, hate crimes and things like that.  Or, like, racial, like -- you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, I thought that was really crazy.  But --
L:  Yeah.  And, ah, I mean, like, people definitely got, like, whipped up into a frenzy --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- about it.  So [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like -- I don't know.  Like, I remember I saw, like, this -- like, you know how -- in Philadelphia there's, like -- like a -- like, ah, food carts on, like, every single corner and they're all run by, like, Arab people?  And, like, there's this one guy, his food cart was just, like, covered in American flags, like, everywhere.  He --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- was, like, "I love America".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Like, "Please don't hurt me".  Like --
R:  [LAUGH] That's, kind of, funny. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I don't know.  Like -- yeah.  Like -- it's just, like, sad to see, like, some people who just, like, can't differentiate between, like, the few people that are actually trying to kill us and, like, you know, h- harmless, like, immigrants that, like, just [LAUGH] want to, like, work --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- and not, like, bomb people. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, that's --
R:  And I think it -- it -- like, it's also so interesting because I mean, it -- I mean, the whole thing is just so controversial because it also instigated, you know, war in the Middle East again and, like, it's just, like, it was such, like, a landmark, you know?  So, it's like a turning point in history.  Like -- and it's, kinda, weird, like, already reading about it in books.  I'm, like, "But it feels like it just happened yesterday".  You know, like, September eleventh, it doesn't seem like it happened that long ago and you're, like, it's already in textbooks.  And you're, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's, kind of, weird, you know?
L:  Yeah.  I -- I've actually, like -- I was thinking a while ago, like, I wanna see what they say about it in text books so that I -- like, I figured it must be in them by now but I'd never -- I mean, I'm not in, like -- in school anymore so I haven't really seen any since then.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I -- I just -- I'm just curious to, like --
R:  It's probably gonna be, you know, like, very bias.  You know, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Obviously, depending, like, where the book is from or the author, you know?  Like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  But -- yeah.  Like, you're right.  It should be interesting, like, what they have to say.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.
L:  It's gonna weird in, like, fifty years and, like, young kids are gonna be, like, "Where were you on September eleventh?" [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  I know.
L:  And I'm gonna have to be, like, "I was in bed". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Went to class --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I came back. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It was weird 'cause I was, like, the -- one of the only times I went to that class. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, man.  But -- yeah.
R:  Go figure. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I was -- I was in school and I'm, like, calling my dad and thinking, ah -- because he was -- he was at home but my mom was actually in Bolivia.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And, um, so she was, like, trying to call and trying to call but, like, it was impossible to get through because, I mean, that day, I can only imagine, like, how many calls must have gone through and through.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then finally, like, she reaches us and she's, like, "Oh, my god, are you guys okay?"  Because, you know, Connecticut's, kinda, close to New York and she didn't really know what was going on and we were, like, "Yeah.  We're fine.  We're fine.  R- -- everything's okay".  And she's, like, "I wanna go home and ..." but she's, like, "I can't.  You know, no one's flying.  You can't have planes".  And that was the other weird thing, like, you're just driving or being outside and there's no, like, planes.  You don't hear a sound from a plane unless it's, like, you know a helicopter or something that's allowed to be up there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I don't know if you noticed but l- -- it was so weird, like, seeing no planes at all.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, like, I was way out in the middle nowhere so I didn't really, like -- I didn't even pick up on that.  But --
R:  I -- yeah.  It was -- it was, kinda, weird for us because we live, like, right near Hartford.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And, like -- and there's an airport there and, like, you know, we usually, like, hear planes or see them all the time and it's just little things like that that you notice.  And it's, like, "What's going on?"  It was, kinda, an eerie feeling too.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  But -- and, like, one of the, um -- one of the girls that went to our high school, she actually died that day.
L:  Oh, man.
R:  And it -- it, kinda, sucked because, um, she -- she went there just for an interview.  Like, she wasn't even supposed to really be there, you know, 'cause she wasn't working there --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- or anything.
L:  Oh, god.
R:  But it just happened that she went, you know, for an interview and, like, you know, that was that day.
L:  Oh, that's terrible.
R:  And then you hear other, like, crazy stories, like, people who, you know, they had a doctor's appointment that day, you know, and --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- people that never go to the doctors or people that were just -- they slept in or, you know, went running and took a little too long and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- just really crazy stories like that.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  It's like you never know.
L:  Yeah.  Totally.
R:  And in that sense, like -- do you think that, like, I mean -- I've never really taken life for granted but it's, kind of like, makes you appreciate a little more 'cause it's -- it's, kinda like, you just never know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know what I mean?  Like, in that sense, I guess it, kinda, changed me.  'Cause I -- I guess I'm just, like, living in the moment, like, at its fullest, you know?  I know, try because you really never know, like -- I mean, it's, kinda, depressing but you just never know.
L:  Yeah.  Totally.
R:  So -- and that's how I feel about it.
L:  Um, do you ever, like -- are you ever worried that, like, something else is gonna happen?
R:  I -- I'm not, like, worried.  Like, it's not constantly in my mind but I think that, like -- I mean, [SIGH] like -- I don't know.  I don't know how to feel about it.  Like, who knows what, kinda, crazed people are gonna do?  Like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I even thought -- remember when those, um, two crazy guys from Mississippi, like, all those shootings in Virginia and, like -- like Northern Virginia and Maryland that area?
L:  Oh, the sniper thing?
R:  Yeah.  I totally thought those snipers were, like, terrorists.
L:  [LAUGH] Yes.
R:  I never thought -- like, I really didn't think that that was gonna be some, like, you know, crazy Americans.  But, like, stuff like that, like, I mean, I don't -- I don't -- really don't know.  But a plane attack?  I mean, it really could happen but it's just so hard to tell.  You know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, I'm not gonna worry about it.  I mean, I live w- -- like, right near a pa- -- nuclear plant and --
L:  Oh, god. [LAUGH]
R:  So, it's, like [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Even, like -- 'cause I go to, like, school here in Virginia and it was so dumb because --
