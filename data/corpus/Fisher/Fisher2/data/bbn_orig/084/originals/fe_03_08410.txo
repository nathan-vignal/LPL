R:  Hi, this is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Sharon.  [NOISE]
L:  Hi, this is Mimi.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  Hi, Mimi.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Hi!
R:  How are y- [LAUGH] you?
L:  I'm good.  How are you??
R:  G- good.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Good.  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Okay, so what changes in your life --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- have taken place?  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  U- um, [SIGH] I think I would have to say just being more con- conscious of, like, my surroundings [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] and just really, [NOISE] y- you know, like, r- realizing that, um, anything can in fact happen at any time, you know?  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, I think [NOISE] --
L:  Anything can --
R:  -- [SIGH] that's true.  [NOISE]
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH] 
R:  I, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I can't really think of, -- a- ah, I -- I'm p- probably more cautious, especially during travelling.
L:  Yeah.
R:  My husband travels [SIGH] quite a bit.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Every day he [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- o- or [NOISE] every --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- week, he leaves on Monday [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and comes back on Thursday.
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  So, every time he leaves I'm like, [NOISE] you know, [SIGH] "Don't die and don't be a [NOISE] [LAUGH] h- [LAUGH] hero".  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Y- yeah.  Like, wow, yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
L:  Just, like, [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- yeah, and I guess --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in travel too --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that's something, y- y- yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That's something[?] -- you're right about [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [NOISE] I made changes --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [NOISE] [SIGH] in my travel too.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, but I wasn't [NOISE] --
R:  And I have [NOISE] --
L:  -- too [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- really not afraid to f- fly or anything [NOISE] after September Eleventh but I -- like I said I was just [NOISE] more conscious --
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- about, you know ...  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, where do you live?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Do you live near a city or ...?  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Um, I live in California.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  So, you were pretty --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- far r- removed --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- from everything.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  I --
L:  I have a lot of friends that live in, [NOISE] um, New York so ...  [SIGH]
R:  Wow!  [NOISE]  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  So, --
R:  Because I [SIGH] --
L:  -- where are you from?  [NOISE]
R:  I'm in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I live in North Carolina.  I think --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- because, um, I have three kids --
L:  [NOISE]  Oh!
R:  -- too I also [SIGH] -- I'm p- probably --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- more cautious.  I went and got --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- them ... on September Eleventh from school because I was -- I was just n- nervous and my husband was on Long Island, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I couldn't get in touch --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- with him, so [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
R:  -- I just wanted everybody, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, as c- close [LAUGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to me [LAUGH] as possible [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  -- if something was going to happen.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]  But, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think I'm probably --
L:  Y- yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  -- a little bit more patriotic, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  --  maybe.  [NOISE]
L:  O- o- oh!  [NOISE]
R:  I have a f- flag and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- take more, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, pride and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I guess I'm just more conscious of, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, where I live and --
L:  [NOISE]  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  And I --
R:  Are you in school?
L:  [NOISE]  [LIPSMACK]  U- um, no, not right now I'm not.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  I've just w- um, -- actually I'm going to go to [NOISE] school but, [SIGH] [NOISE] um, [NOISE] probably, like, [NOISE] next -- in the fall but I'm [NOISE] not right now.  [NOISE]
R:  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, so [NOISE] um --
R:  What do you want to study?
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Um, I'm going to study, um, [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] a pharmacy technician, -- like, pharmacy.
R:  Wow, that's great!
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  So, ...
R:  [SIGH]  That's a great idea.  [NOISE]
L:  Y- yeah.  So, [SIGH] [NOISE] there's the health -- there's a really big need for the health care field --
R:  Oh, my gosh, yeah.
L:  -- so I really want to get into that.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  My husband is, um, [LIPSMACK] -- a consultant --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in health care.  So, --
L:  Oh!  Oh, okay.
R:  -- [SIGH] yeah, he's --
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  -- he does real well.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.  Yeah, so I think -- I don't know, I -- I think a lot of more people are, like, [SIGH] -- um, [LIPSMACK] I think a lot of more people are worried, like, um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if there's gonna, like, be [SIGH] ... a second effect to September Eleventh --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- but I'm thinking, you know, it'd be -- I don't know it seems like if we couldn't predict the first one there's no way we'll be able to predict a second, --
R:  I know.
L:  -- if it happens again, you know?  So, ...
R:  Well, you would think that maybe the FBI and CIA [NOISE] are a little bit more [SIGH] -- on their toes now that they kind of ignored a few [NOISE] [SIGH] s- signs from the last --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- time and maybe they won't be that way ... this time.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, maybe so.  [NOISE]
R:  I do, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I used to go to -- I'm, a- ah, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Lebanese --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- in my background and I -- I did belong to a Lebanese American club ... here in Charlotte.  And [SIGH] --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I haven't gone to any of the meetings since September Eleventh just because I feel funny about it.  And [SIGH] I'm not as, you know, I don't -- I'm not as vocal about my nationality, I guess as I was before.  [MN]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  Um, --
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  -- even though I'm only a portion Lebanese I mean it was -- it was a big part of my life.  [NOISE]  It was, ah, --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you know, I've [SIGH] [NOISE] --
L:  Mm.  [NOISE]
R:  -- my grandmother's a hundred percent and, [NOISE] you know, it was just [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] but now --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I'm kind of just, -- um, not embarrassed but I just don't c- call attention to it, --
L:  Y- yes.  [SIGH]
R:  -- 'cause I don't want people to, "Oh!" you know think like [LAUGH] that.  [LAUGH]
L:  Y- yeah, [SIGH] how people are and [NOISE] -- and that's another [NOISE] thing.  A lot of -- I think a lot of people's lives changed for that --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- as they targeted people or they --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- looked at people a certain way, you know.  [SIGH]
R:  I think so.
L:  Which wasn't a good thing at all 'cause --
R:  No.
L:  -- I mean, ah, [NOISE] --
R:  I mean, n- n- n- not that it already was -- people, you know, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- being [SIGH] type cast and [MN] but now it's even worse.
L:  Yeah, it was more so [NOISE] ... I think.
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  [MN]  But o- other than that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I really don't know [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  -- changes that I've made.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
L:  No.  [NOISE]  I guess not m- me either even really.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  So, ... [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Um, --
L:  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- we gotta keep [LAUGH] d- doing i- [LAUGH] it.
L:  I -- I was just trying to think of, um, [NOISE] [SIGH] anything to say about it, like, -- 'cause I think it -- more changes are more or less about, like you said, um -- [SIGH] um, what other people are doing as far as, like, FBI and things like that, you know?
R:  Yes, [NOISE] they're --
L:  Like, u- um, --
R:  -- those things are probably --
L:  -- beefing up security at the airports and things like that.  I think --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I guess that's just [SIGH] -- there are changes they've made but I don't know.  [NOISE]  [MN]
R:  I'll bet [NOISE] I mean --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if you would have [NOISE] given us this --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- c- call ... on September, -- you know, the week following there would have been --
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  -- a lot more changes.
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  But now that it's just --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- been so long I think we're kind of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] well I don't think I've --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- made any changes, but w- we probably have and just aren't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- aware [SIGH] that our behavior --
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] has changed.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  Because it's just ... kind of s- second nature now --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that we don't ... maybe d- don't do things that we used to or, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] you know, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if we saw some ... bag of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't know ... packages and that kind of stuff or --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] are we a little bit more cautious --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- when we open mail?  I mean, I look at return addresses now but --
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [SIGH] I never did that before.  [NOISE]
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  And I guess that's ... s- something --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I [NOISE] s- subconsciously --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- do but don't [SIGH] really realize that, oh, it's because that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- anthrax thing that, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- yeah, that's why I'm --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- doing it but --
L:  [NOISE]  Mm.  [NOISE]  Yeah, exactly I -- yeah, I guess y- you're just doing it 'cause you're just going through the motions not realizing that you made, like, a change by doing --
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  -- that.  [SIGH]  Yeah, that's true.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  You know with packages and things like that and [SIGH] [NOISE] --
R:  Right, I mean, it's not, like, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] the other day I got an envelope --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and it didn't have, ... you know, I didn't know where it was from --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and it looked --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- kind of funny.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And I thought, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- "O- oh!" [SIGH] [NOISE] and it just crossed [NOISE] my mind --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for an instant [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that maybe [NOISE] [SIGH] I shouldn't open it.  But I d- did.
L:  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
R:  But just the fact that that -- those things cross my mind.
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Um, probably wouldn't have happened before --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [NOISE]  September Eleventh.
L:  [NOISE]  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  The kids [NOISE] are funny how they, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [MN] talk about it.  [NOISE]  A- and they talk about the bad people that crashed into the buildings and --
L:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] so we have those conversations --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because they get worried [NOISE] about when daddy takes an airplane [NOISE] and that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- kind of thing.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  And those conversations probably wouldn't have taken place [NOISE] [SIGH] ... before.
L:  [NOISE]  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  Yeah, I think so.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [MN]  Then it's just like the airport is another reas- -- that's --it's crazy going there now, um, -- when you travel you just basically have to [SIGH] -- they go through your stuff and they ... make you take off your shoes and --
R:  Oh, I know.
L: -- it's just -- it's crazy.
R:  Really silly.
L:  You have to get to the airport, like, two hours [NOISE] in advance just to get [SIGH] -- just to get through all that stuff.
R:  I know, my --
L:  It's really crazy.  [NOISE]
R:  -- husband's gone through --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they've taken so many of his --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- nail clippers.
L:  O- o- oh!  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm like, --
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
R:  -- "Yeah, he's really --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- going to be dangerous cutting people's --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- nails".  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  It's -- that's pretty [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- funny.  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]  Yes, it's to be [NOISE] --
R:  But yeah, [SIGH] --
L:  -- you really like [NOISE] -- a lot of changes.
R:  -- because he --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- travels so much I guess he just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- automatically takes --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- his shoes off and he automatically, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- knows [SIGH] how --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- how to get through --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- security without --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] waiting --
L:  [MN]  Uh-hum.
R:  -- in line and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- being detained.
L:  [NOISE]  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  But, [SIGH] yeah, I guess --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it -- when we go --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't really think --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- about it [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, I --
R:  -- n- now.
L:  -- don't.  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  The first time we flew --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] I was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- nervous and the kids --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- were nervous.
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  And they kept looking around and, --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- yeah, it was kind of scary ... the first time --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- but -- 'cause we went -- I think we went --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- home for Christmas.
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  Y- yeah.
R:  [NOISE]  But now they, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, [NOISE] I think they forgotten about it.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Uh-huh.  Y- [LAUGH] yeah.  [NOISE]  Yes, I don't know.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  I --
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, I -- I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I, um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- agree with you if the call --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- was made, like, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- earlier about it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we probably remember [NOISE] things --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- better.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  Oh, my o- other [NOISE] phone is ringing.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [MN]
L:  So, what kind of weather do you guys get out there in North Car- -- South Cara- ...
R:  It's nice.  [NOISE]  I mean it's h- [SIGH] [NOISE] hot now.
L:  Mm.  Oh, okay.
R:  But it didn't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- start getting hot --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [NOISE] until --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [NOISE] a couple of weeks ago, like, nineties.
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  So, um, -- but it'll stay hot probably until September --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- when the kids --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- go back to school.  They- -- they're still in shorts and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] it's hot.  [NOISE]
L:  Oh!
R:  But I love it here.  [NOISE]  I used to live in Florida and it was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] [NOISE] e- excruciating --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- h- [LAUGH] hot.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  O- o- oh!  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  I hated it.  We'd go visit my parents in the summer and the kids won't go outside --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  --too hot.  [SIGH]
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Which -- where --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in California are you?  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  Um, I live, like, in the East Bay, [SIGH] -- like, San Francisco area.
R:  [SIGH]  Oh, okay.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  So, ...
R:  So, that's cool, [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, --
R:  -- is it?
L:  -- we get m- mixed weather out here.  It's, [NOISE] like, um, [SIGH] a couple of weeks ago it was, like, really, really, hot and, you know, it was like, [NOISE] [SIGH] hot for a days [NOISE] and then it's, like, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- c- cools off and it's ... b- breezy but it's still pleasant.  [NOISE]  So, ...
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  That's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- somebody told me I should move there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because it's ... always --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- cool.  [SIGH]  [MN]
L:  O- o- oh!  [LAUGH]
R:  And I'm, like, --
