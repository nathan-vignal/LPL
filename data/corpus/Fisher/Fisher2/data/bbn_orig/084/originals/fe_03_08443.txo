R:  Charlotte Solomon.
L:  Uh, Vaheir[?] Hertz.
R:  Pardon me.
L:  Uh, my name is Vaheir, you can just call me Zee, it's easier.
R:  I can't hear you.
L:  You can't hear me?
R:  I hear you now, go ahead.
L:  Okay, yeah, you can just call me Zee, it's, um --
R:  Oh, your name is Zee?
L:  Yeah, it's easier.
R:  Okay, I'm Charlotte.
L:  How you doing, Charlotte?
R:  Okay.  
L:  So, what changes have you felt since, uh, September eleventh?  What changes have you made?
R:  Ha- what changes have I made?
L:  Mhm.  In you life --
R:  Well, I've been, you know, very upset about that and just trying, you know, to go on and do things, you know.
L:  Have you -- have you had a chance to fly at all since the September eleventh?
R:  Did I fly since September -- no, I didn't fly since September eleventh.
L:  Oh, okay.  No, I have and I've noticed, I mean, initially you have, like, armed security and whatnot in the airports, um --
R:  N- no, I went -- we went -- no, I didn't -- I didn't fly but we went on, uh, on a bus --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and we had to go through customs and ch- and we checked everything, checked and all that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Passport, your, uh, ID and all that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Check your bags and all that.
L:  Yeah, I was shocked because I went, um, [LIPSMACK] I had -- I'd flown to Upstate New York and then coming back actually I had my whole bag checked, not the, uh -- not my carry on but actually my bag that was being checked in.
R:  Right.
L:  They went through everything so, I mean --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- it's kinda embarrassing 'cause I'd sit at a hotel and, you know, you take the little -- the free soaps and the -- [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  -- and the shampoos.
R:  Yeah, but they checked -- I know.
L:  Uh, they went through everything, yeah.  And, I mean, I've had times where, you know, you have like scissors or something small, they're gonna, like, confiscate that.
R:  Right --
L:  Um --
R:  -- and, uh, they check everything.
L:  Yeah, definitely.  And as far as, um, are you happy with, uh, the way things have been handled, do you feel any -- do you feel any more secure since the war with Iraq and whatnot?  Do you feel --
R:  Well, I don't -- I don't -- I -- I -- that, I think [MN] -- that, I think -- I -- I think that was worse than nine one one.  I mean, that's -- that was -- oh god.
L:  Yeah, I -- I completely agree because it's just -- now you're gonna have a whole new generation of people that hate the United States because the same shock that we went through, they've experienced.  I mean, they must have had at least three thousand people that were killed there --
R:  I know, that's worse.
L:  -- we did our shock and awe and, as far as making people --
R:  I mean --
L:  -- more secure, I think it just did the opp- --
R:  -- and -- and a lot of things that happening now they're blam- they think it's terrorists half the stuff that is happening here.
L:  Yeah, definitely.  So, what about, um, [LIPSMACK] your immediate family and whatnot are they -- are they travelling at all or no?
R:  No, no.
L:  Okay.
R:  I just -- no, me and my husband travel, we went to Niagara Falls on a bus and we had to go through customs and they came on the bus and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they ask you questions and you had to show -- oh, man. 
L:  Did they bring on, like, drug sniffing dogs or not?
R:  No, not on -- no --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- th- they just came on and you had to show your ID, you had to show your birth certificate --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and if you were a citizen and all this and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- made us more nervous, you know.
L:  Yeah, I know, it's true.  I had -- I've taken a bus before from Seattle into Vancouver and this was before -- this was actually the summer leading up to September eleventh and it was -- it was completely relaxed, like they [LAUGH] -- you could leave your bag on the bus, they came out they just checked your passports and that was it but I'm sure --
R:  And then we went -- went to the ballgame and they -- they wouldn't let no plastic containers, oh man.
L:  Yeah, exactly how you gonna get a -- [LAUGH] you need be able to bring your own drink in or something.
R:  No, no, that -- my -- I was with my friend and she had this plastic jug and it only had water in it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they wouldn't -- they wouldn't let her take it in and they told her to leave it here --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and when she come out she can pick it up and guess what?  It wasn't there.
L:  Yeah, I believe it.  No, I believe it.
R:  They won't let you take -- they won't let you take no jugs in there.
L:  Yeah.  Okay, so what about when the time for election, do you feel that, uh, do think George Bush is gonna just play off people's fear.  'Cause, I mean, that's one thing I kinda --
R:  A lot of people don't like him.
L:  I just feel like -- I feel like it's not really fair because they're only trying to get -- they're trying to keep you scared with all these orange alerts --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and i- if it's gonna happen no one can control it, I mean, you're gonna have to -- you kinda have to live your life regardless, you know, it's --
R:  Right and I still --
L:  -- you could get hit --
R:  -- think the terrorists are going to hit again.
L:  I mean, I'm sure they will but it's strange too just like you see with -- they talk about the, um, the commission that was set up to actually investigate September eleventh.
R:  Right.
L:  They've only been allowed to start now and I've heard that every step of the way they're being met with resistance from the White House, like, they don't want the real information to come out --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so you'll see that the connections are very close, like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- with the Bush family and the Bin Ladens so -- I don't know, it's kinda of a -- I think people'd be upset if they saw the real truth, you know [LAUGH].
R:  Right.
L:  If that came out of it but, uh --
R:  If they ever find him.
L:  Yeah, and, I mean, that's the other one, I mean, i- it kinda makes it easier to, uh -- I just -- I'm amazed that he in fact is this villain the one -- like they said that fifteen people that had been involved in September eleventh were from Saudi Arabia.
R:  Right.
L:  Well, we're not even mentioning that 'cause we have good connections with them for oil.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I don't know, it's a -- it's a -- it's a strange thing 'cause I heard now that they talked about in Iraq they're building a, uh, a pipeline for the oil through Kuwait.
R:  Right.
L:  So, it's -- we're not gonna involve our friends if -- even if they are har- even if they're harboring terrorists, you know, we're not gonna get them --
R:  No.
L:  -- involved in it so --
R:  No.
L:  -- it kinda seems like a double standard but, uh, do you think anyone's gonna be able to stand up against George Bush or ...?  Election time.
R:  Well, I really though Gore was gonna run again but he said, "No".
L:  Right.  And who did you vote for last time?
R:  Gore.
L:  Okay, I actually voted for neither but, um, yeah, I kind of -- I mean, I think i- if anyone else had been in office I don't know how they would have handled it but I'm sure that we wouldn't have gone to war with Iraq, you know.
R:  No.
L:  I'm sure we would have had the same attack on Afghanistan --
R:  No, the other --
L:  -- but not --
R:  -- person wouldn't have let this, Bush let -- I mean --
L:  And then do -- do you think that it's a big deal though that since -- when he talked about in January a war on terrorism, you know, he tr- tried to com- to tie a link between, uh -- they're saying that, uh, in Africa they sold this uranium to Iraq and he had -- he pa- he pointed that out that was a big reason --
R:  Right.
L:  -- why we needed to go and invade Iraq and now they're saying that the -- the documents were forged --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and that they really don't have any proof.
R:  I don't know.
L:  I mean, do you think it's gonna hurt when, uh, they never find weapons of mass destruction, do you think anyone's gonna be upset with --
R:  I think the -- I think some people are gonna be upset.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But they're never gonna find that gu- they're never gonna find him.
L:  Mhm.
R:  'Cause they don't even know where he's at.
L:  Right.
R:  Or do they -- I don't --
L:  I mean, it's interesting 'cause I mean I don't know what to believe but I found another article saying that, um, [LIPSMACK] oh, what is his name?  Do you remember when we had -- we found out a top official in the government had been a spy, his name was Hanson?
R:  Yeah.
L:  They said that -- oh, what did he -- what -- what's he disclosing was it a big deal, and people were saying, "Um, it actually is a very big deal" but they wouldn't be specific.  The one thing I heard is that [LIPSMACK] computer information that we use that would basically track all of our whereabouts on the globe as far as the tax and whatnot --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that he gave away the information to that computer so they're thinking that maybe Osama Bin Laden or Saddam Hussein --
R:  Right.
L:  -- would have access to that so they'll know where the [NOISE] United States is planning on attacking before they do it so they can have, like, a one step up on --
R:  I hope -- I don't -- I don't know if they're gonna d- do another attack, I don't know.
L:  Right.  I just think it's hard to -- to feel like -- I don't think anyone feels more secure since we supposedly freed the Iraqis, you know, I think people feel just as nervous so it didn't really -- it didn't help anything.
R:  Right.
L:  And then as far as -- what about the Anthrax attacks, they've never done anything with that -- that remains --
R:  No, they let that go.
L:  Yeah, I -- I don't -- I kinda feel like we get -- we start a lot of things and never finish them, you know, like--
R:  Right.
L:  -- what's the next war gonna be, I mean --
R:  I don't know what's --
L:  -- do you think it's gonna be Iran or Libya?
R:  I think it's gonna be Iran.
L:  The other thing I heard was that one of the reasons behind us doing these attacks is trying to help Israel -- if we got rid of governments that are -- that will side with Palestinians --
R:  Right.
L:  -- we'd be more likely to then let Israel have control of that land so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- instead of actually helping the -- the conflict between Israel and Palestinians were attacking all of the neighbors to try to make it easier for Israel to remain -- to remain in power so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I'm not sure.
R:  I don't know.
L:  Who are you gonna vote for?  Do you have any- anyone you like so far for two thousand and four?
R:  Well, I don't -- who's gonna run against Bush now?
L:  I don't know, only -- the leading democrat I heard was this guy named Howard Dean.
R:  No, I don't know.
L:  He's, um, out of Vermont.  I guess -- they said he was one of the few democrats that was opposed to the war from the very beginning.
R:  Right.
L:  He was really outspoken where I feel like now democrats, they don't really have any power, I don't see them doing anything --
R:  No.
L:  -- like, the biggest they complain about with Bill Clinton was his sex life and if that's the worst thing you've done --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but then you have someone else who's like --
R:  Government --
L:  -- started these wars and they don't have reason for it.
R:  No.
L:  I don't know, it seems pretty tough.
R:  Right.
L:  Have you -- have you participated in any of these conversations before or is this your first one?
R:  Pardon me?  No, this --
L:  Have you ever -- 
R:  -- is my first one.
L:  Okay, and me too.  Me too.  So, how far do you think we are?
R:  Pretty far.
L:  Okay [LAUGH].
R:  The first time I'm doing this.
L:  Well, I didn't -- I didn't look at the clock but I'm hoping we're doing okay.
R:  Well, how -- wh- --
L:  So, what else though?  What do you think, um -- do you think that there's really going to be a big attack in the next year or nothing?
R:  Well, I -- I think the terrorists are going to hit again.  
L:  Right.
R:  I know -- but I don't know when -- who they're gonna hit.
L:  [NOISE] Well, what do you imagine?
R:  They -- they really wanted the capital and they didn't get it.  
L:  Right.
R:  They really wanted Washington.
L:  Mhm.  And do you think that --
R:  So, they -- I don't know.
L:  -- do you think that, um, they had any intelligence knowing that this attack was coming or do you think they were really caught off guard?
R:  I think they were -- I don't think they -- I don't think they knew it was coming.
L:  Right.
R:  I don't think so.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Do you think that they knew it was coming?
L:  Um, I don't think so but the one thing I heard was that when Clinton got out of office he had a whole big folder telling them, "You need to look out for Osama Bin Laden" and they had, like, their number one suspects, "You need to keep an eye on these people" and because --
R:  And they did.
L:  And because it was Clinton though they're, like, "Forget it.  We're not interested" you know, like, it -- they didn't wanna take his advice at all --
R:  Right.
L:  -- 'cause they resented him so, um -- I -- I don't know, it's funny because you have all these government agencies that are supposed to collect information, they collect it but then you still have humans that have to sort through it.  So, you could have the best information in the world but if the top people aren't listening or looking at the right pieces --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it doesn't mean much, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  So, uh --
