L:  Hi, my name's Laura.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, hi, my name is Tam.
L:  [MN]  Nice to meet you, Kim.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, it's Tam, T.A.M.
L:  Tam?  Di- --
R:  Right.  [SIGH]  Yeah, I -- you know what, ah, Laura, is such a -- a rare name and I have a friend named, Deloris[?].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Isn't that interesting.  Well --  [LAUGH]
L:  It is.
R:  Yeah.  So, how are you?  [SIGH]
L:  Okay.  Good.
R:  Good.  Good.  [SIGH]
L:  S- so, how's --
R:  What --
L:  -- your life changed since nine eleven. [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Well, I can't really say that our life has changed, because we didn't want to let it, --
L:  Right
R:  -- you know.  [SIGH]  And [SIGH] I mean life for us has, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [NOISE] gone on just as it did before --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] as far as, you k- know, vacations and f- flying and [SIGH] all those kind of issues that come u- up, you know.  [SIGH]  Um, [LIPSMACK] we -- we just didn't want to let it stop our life.  How about you?  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Um, [SIGH] a- a- about the same as y- you, ah, [SIGH] I have a little, um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't fly too often --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- anyhow.
R:  Okay.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  A- and I think my first plane trip --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] since ... nine eleven would be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a l- little scary for me.
R:  Okay.  So, --
L:  But, ah, --
R:  -- you h- haven't flown since then at all, then?
L:  No, I have not.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  Have you?
R:  [SIGH]  We have many times.  In fact, um, [NOISE] my husband and I flew ... a week after it happened.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  And, [SIGH] it was a planned trip, [SIGH] um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] and I -- you know we -- I -- I can't say we didn't think about it 'cause we have a son and he was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- at home with my mom and dad.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, but like I said we just made the decision that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- these people ... are not going to stop us.
L:  Oh, no, [NOISE] they're n- not.
R:  You know, we can be in a car [SIGH] without our son [NOISE] and something can happen.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  The same way we can be in a plane and something can happen.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know what I'm saying?
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, I do.  [NOISE]
R:  So, [NOISE] that's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that's how that [NOISE] decision came into play for us, you know.  [SIGH]  Um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- has it affected your life in any other w- ways?
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  A- ah, [SIGH] not really.  At first, um, it ... made me ... look at my, um, neighbors a little differently because they were --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [SIGH], um, [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- f- from over there.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.
L:  [SIGH]  And, um, it was a l- little hard n- not to [NOISE] --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- not look at 'em differently.
R:  Uh-hum.  Yep.
L:  [SIGH]  But after a while it --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- just, um, you know, faded away and --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- we ... still barbecue with them and --
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Oh, that's good.
L:  -- [SIGH] t- that [NOISE] kind of s- stuff.
R:  Right.
L:  But at first, y- y- you kind of, "Mm".  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Now, was it something you were ever -- ever able to, like, [SIGH] discuss with t- them?  Or was it just uncomfortable for everybody?
L:  [SIGH]  Um, ... it wasn't to the point [NOISE] where it was t- that uncomfortable --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for us.  And, [SIGH] no, ah, we never discussed it.
R:  Okay.
L:  And I don't t- think they realized that I had those feelings.
R:  Okay.  Well, that's good.  That's --
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  -- good.  And they might have felt bad t- too, you know?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, ah, maybe some of the same things that you were feeling they were feeling too, [SIGH] you know, who knows?
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Y- yeah, you can -- you can probably t- think that they must, like, [SIGH] feel really paranoid that people are [NOISE] thinking bad about t- them.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  And, you know, you got to put yourself in their [NOISE] shoes.
R:  Exactly.
L:  [MN]  So, ...
R:  I think one c- change that comes to mind that -- [SIGH] h- has been --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- m- made for us but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- really not a conscious change, [SIGH] um, is just more -- it's just the way things are.  It's just financially, I mean, [SIGH] I think --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- be- -- be- because of the way the whole economy has changed since nine eleven, [SIGH] I think things have changed for us.  I mean we own a business [SIGH] and we could see that things have changed in our business and --
L:  Really?
R:  -- yeah, [SIGH] and, [SIGH] therefore, that kind of dribbles down to us, you know --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- that's, -- um, less customers are spending then, y- [LAUGH] you k- know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] I mean it's -- it's just -- ah, i- it's just has -- what do they call the domino effect, I guess, [SIGH] you know.
L:  Right.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Um, so I think that's a change that I can say that, [SIGH] um, has definitely been made for us but ... n- not because we --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- consciously decided to.  It just weren't -- just the way it is.
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, um, -- ah, I'm glad you brought that up because [SIGH] I've, ah, my [SIGH] h- husband he's, um, [SIGH] had a tremendous change at work, um, --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- f- from the -- decreased in production [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- and stuff.  Um, [SIGH] he went from being --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a ... top engineer to [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- being offered to sort parts --
R:  O- o- oh!
L:  -- at a factory.  [SIGH]
R:  O- o- oh!  [NOISE]
L:  Um, you know, 'cause he's the only man on the totem pole.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  And that just really affected us and [SIGH] so I can --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] that's, you know, I guess ... w- when you talk to people about it you don't [SIGH] -- there's new concepts that you don't ... think about that somebody else b- brings up.  [SIGH]
R:  Right, exactly.  [SIGH]  I mean I feel ... fortunate on one hand.  I mean, you know, [SIGH] I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- when you hear other people's stories ... [SIGH] I feel blessed that we at least are able to have what we have.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [SIGH]  Because I know s- s- so ... many people are struggling, [SIGH] you know, far worse than what I could ever say we are.  So, --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- and so I mean I feel blessed to be -- but yet I -- I do feel very bad for the people [SIGH] that you hear about all the time in the news and the radio and, [SIGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, people there are just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] without insurance, without jobs, without -- y- you know, can't ... pay their bills and -- and, you know, [NOISE] it -- it's like --
L:  Oh, yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] a- all [SIGH] been highlighted since September Eleventh.  Now, I don't know maybe it was going on before but [SIGH] I -- I definitely -- don't you think that it seems like it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- definitely since September Eleventh that we -- it seems like it's so much more --
L:  More prevalent.
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Then I also think about ... families that have children over there.
R:  Oh, right.  [SIGH]
L:  Um, fighting --
R:  Right.  [NOISE]
L:  -- that just [SIGH] -- well my cousin has a son and it just is [NOISE] [SIGH] ... terrible.
R:  It is.  It is.  [SIGH]  And then, you know, I -- I thought it was over, you know, the war was -- was bad and, you know, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I guess it's still going on.  [SIGH]  But then it felt like the war was over and then, every day now we're still hearing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- about people that are dying, you know, our people that are dying over there.  And [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and l- like you said I feel so bad for the [SIGH] --
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  -- the families[?] and everything, you know.  It -- it's tough.  [COUGH]  It's tough.  [LIPSMACK]  But [SIGH] were you affected, um, like did you know anybody that was affected by September Eleventh?
L:  N- no, [SIGH] how about you?  [SIGH]
R:  No.  Uh-uh.  No.
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  Fortunately, no, you know.
L:  Yeah, um, [SIGH] I'm glad I didn't.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, absolutely.  Absolutely.  [LIPSMACK]  No.
L:  So, ...
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  But ...
R:  I'm trying to think any other ways that maybe I was affected by it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but I know that that's the most [SIGH] prevalent thing that comes to mind is just financially but --
L:  [SIGH]  I -- I've gotten a lot more into [NOISE] politics s- since then.
R:  Oh, have you?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Okay.
L:  [SIGH]  So, that's affected me, --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- with the politics.
R:  Right.  Uh-hum.
L:  And paying more attention to the government and such.
R:  Okay.
L:  [SIGH]  I did, y- you know, a -- a little, um, [SIGH] you know as far as going to campaign headquarters and [SIGH] helping [NOISE] to campaign, but now I [SIGH] -- I do a lot more and I'm a lot more ... [SIGH] active in politics than [SIGH] I was before.
R:  Uh-hum.  And that's a good thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean do you -- do you -- do you like that ... you are or do you feel more like you need to be than want to be?
L:  [SIGH]  A- ah, I feel like I need to be.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  Yeah.
L:  A- ah, yeah, I do.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  But, um, [MN] you know, ... w- we've let 'em take over the country in so many ways [SIGH] that [PAUSE] I need to have my voice heard.  Not letting 'em take over the country in so many ways.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  Does that make sense?
R:  Yeah, it does.  Get your voice out there.  Sure.  Uh-hum.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Yeah.  [SIGH]  I can't say that in that way it has changed.  I mean I [SIGH] -- I was never really too big into politics before a- and I don't -- and I'm definitely still not.  [SIGH]  So, in essence it hasn't changed me.  [SIGH]  I'm kind of one of those people that [SIGH] on election day I'll say to my husband, "Okay, who am I v- [LAUGH] voting f- for?  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  You know, tell me who I'm voting for?"  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And -- and I know t- that's not something I should --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm not proud of but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but it's just -- just what I do, you know?
L:  [NOISE]  Right.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Um, [MN] and I feel he's made good choices [SIGH] so far --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so he's steering me in the right direction I guess.  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  So, [LIPSMACK] anyway, [SIGH] ...
L:  Yeah, [SIGH] now how about your c- children, did, ah, you said ... you have one ... son or two?
R:  I do.  I have one son.  Uh-hum.
L:  Okay.  How did they feel -- I -- I mean have they been affected in any way [SIGH] or [SIGH] --
R:  You know what, um, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- he is now nine and a half so when this happened, um, [LIPSMACK] what would he have been 'cause it was -- he was about two years Sept- --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so he was probably almost ... e- eight when it happened.  [SIGH]  Um, and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I can't say it affected him, and I'll tell you why, 'cause [SIGH] my husband and I kind of sheltered him f- from it.
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  We -- you know we, u- -um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] for days on end did not let him watch TV, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  And -- and when he would go to my mom and dad's I'm like, "Don't talk about it.  Don't ... have TV on" you know, f- for the weeks that it was on TV [SIGH] and I went into school and I asked 'em, "What do you guys want to talk to the kids about?  I want to know what you're gonna say?"  You know, 'cause I -- I just didn't feel [SIGH] like I said because we fly all the time, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- we go on vacations and [SIGH] I don't think it was necessary he knew the details.
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  And, um, so he never knew.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, [SIGH] for him ... no, I -- it -- it definitely has not affected him.  There's no f- frights, um, [SIGH] --
