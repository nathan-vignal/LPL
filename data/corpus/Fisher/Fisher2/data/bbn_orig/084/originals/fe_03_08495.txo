L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  My name's Ken.
R:  My name's Charlotte.
L:  Oh, hello.
R:  I'm from Philadelphia.
L:  I'm, ah, in New York City.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, you heard the topic?
R:  I think I heard -- I -- I couldn't get the end of it.  What did she say?
L:  Um, it was about, ah, should athletes get the high salary that they're receiving.  Something about a strike.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I don't follow sports at all.
R:  I do.  I follow the Philly's.
L:  Okay.
R:  For baseball.  Go ahead.
L:  Is there a baseball strike going on?
R:  No.
L:  Um and there's no other --
R:  I wonder what kind of --
L:  -- no other sports going on right now, are there?
R:  No.  Ah, we have baseball in Philadelphia.
L:  Yeah, and it's not football season.  Hockey season's over.
R:  No, so I don't know who's going on strike.
L:  Hm.  Was there a strike recently?
R:  Was there a strike?  Not that I know -- not -- not in Pennsylvania.  Was there a strike in New York of anything?
L:  Ah, no.  I mean, I'm assuming the -- the players are all in some kind of a union so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they would be striking nationally.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, maybe they're talking about -- was there a baseball strike last year?  I know there was one, but I don't remember when it was.
R:  There was one.  There was one a while back, a baseball strike.  With the umpires or something.
L:  Ah, yeah.  I kind of remember hearing about it, but --
R:  That was the one, right.
L:  Um, well what -- so what is your opinion?  Do you think that they're ah, they're asking for too much?
R:  Do I think that -- I -- do I think they should strike, or not?  I think they're -- they're getting paid too much.
L:  You think they're getting paid too much?
R:  I think they're getting paid too much.  I mean, well, that's the umpires.  Now the baseball people, they got -- some of these baseball players are getting ridiculous amounts.  Ridiculous.
L:  Yeah, yeah, but do you think they're entitled to it?  I mean, due to their talent.
R:  I think some of them are entitled to it, but not, you know, but see if they give it to some then the other ones want it.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I think it's all -- it's all become big business and media and, you know, all this money from advertising gets involved and it just keeps --
R:  Right.
L:  -- kind of like being the stock market bubble.  It just keeps --
R:  I mean, like -- like Mike -- the ones that are retired they got a lot of money.  Mike Smith, nah, come on now.  Kurt Hew and they all got that.
L:  Mm.
R:  In New York you had good players too that got a lot of money.
L:  Right, yeah.  And every time -- every [LAUGH] every, ah, season they're always talking about these --
R:  Right.
L:  -- new players brought over for these huge contracts, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- a million dollars a season, two million dollars a season.
R:  They got it.
L:  Um, and I -- I don't know that I have a clear opinion because I think that if they're that talented and they draw in the fans and the -- and the mon- -- and the advertisers, then why not?  They -- they deserve it.
R:  They deserve it, I guess, if, you know 
L:  Yeah, but I just think that um, big money, you know, the -- the money that comes from the advertisers and the big corporations is kind of ruining the sport --
R:  I know, but some of these players -- they get a lot of money, these baseball players.  Come on now.  I think they do.  But I guess they're worth it, I guess.
L:  Yeah.  Um, yeah, like I said, I -- I don't have any real strong opinions on it, but you know, just from my business background the smarter people, the more talented people, always tend to earn the more money.
R:  Right.
L:  So, you know, just look at the people who work on Wall Street.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, they make billions of dollars.
R:  Millions, my god, great.
L:  But you know, it's because they're smart and they know -- they know how to do it, so I guess, you know, if these people are talented and can play baseball, then --
R:  Well, it's the only -- it's --
L:  -- why -- you know, why should all that money go to the owners?
R:  It's any sport, really.  It's not just the base- -- you know.
L:  Yeah.  Well, football, all that.  But you know, why should that money go to the owners?
R:  It shouldn't.  Do you think it should go to the owners?
L:  No.  No.  I mean, what are the other -- the ah, you know, the other choices?  
R:  Right.
L:  If the players don't get it, where else would it go?
R:  I think, well, that the owners shouldn't get it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They think they should pro- -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- they probably think they should, but you know.  We did have a baseball strike a while back and I don't know, you know -- I don't think baseball players should strike.  But if the umpires -- if the umpires strike there's no games.
L:  Right.  Well the ah, the umpires have a whole different set of issues.  They're not making the multi million dollars --
R:  Right.  No.
L:  -- that the -- that the players are.
R:  The players -- the players make a fortune.
L:  When they did strike, what was the um -- what were the issues?  What were they complaining about?
R:  I don't know.  More mo- -- it could have been more money.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, it could have been.  I don't think -- I don't remember -- I don't remember what they striked for.  And I didn't -- I heard about it but I didn't follow it.  So I don't know what they -- what they striked -- you know, what they struck for.
L:  Mm.  Okay.  Yeah, see I -- I guess I don't follow it either, so I'm really -- I'm not really sure [LAUGH] 
R:  Did you have a strike in New York?
L:  Well --
R:  That we -- no --
L:  -- my understanding is that if the, you know, if there's a player strike in any sport it -- it's all over the place.
R:  Right.
L:  It's not just one team.
R:  Right.
L:  It's the whole -- the whole, you know --
R:  Well they -- they did, yeah --
L:  -- division, league, whatever.
R:  -- it was a -- it was -- yeah, it's all over.
L:  Yeah.  So um, you know, and I don't think there's been one recently.  I think they were threatening --
R:  Right.
L:  -- a strike a couple of years ago.  I don't know if it -- no, it did happen I think, for a couple of games and then they -- somebody backed down.
R:  It did happen for a couple of games and -- and then they settled it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It did -- it did happen.
L:  Yeah.  I thought -- yeah -- I mean, I guess I can see their point of view.  If there's all this money being thrown into the pot --
R:  Right.
L:  -- why shouldn't they, as the talent that's drawing the money in --
R:  Right.
L:  -- get more of it than, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- going to the owners.  I mean, it'd be nice if there was some way to channel it back into the community --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, 'cause each of these -- each of these teams is assigned to a city, but um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, I don't know [LAUGH] I don't know that they can legally do that.
R:  No.
L:  So if it's a choice between the owners and the players, I -- you know, why not give it to the players?
R:  Right, that's true.
L:  They're the ones who're -- they're -- they're earning it, the owners really don't do much.
R:  No.  So I guess they should get -- they should get what they want technically, if they want.
L:  Do you follow any other sports besides baseball?
R:  No.  I -- well, a little bit of basketball because I used to like the Hornets because they were named, the Charlotte Hornets.  That was my name.  But now it's not the Charlotte Hornets any more.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And I love the Philly's.  I went to four games already.
L:  Wow.
R:  'Cause they gave out the bobble -- they gave out the Mike Smith bobble head and -- and the other -- the other famous retired that gave up.   You know what the bobble heads are?
L:  No, I don't.
R:  It's a Philly player and -- and -- like, you're supposed to put it on your dashboard of your car and every time you move the car it goes up and down --
L: Oh, right, right, right.  Yeah.
R:  -- the bobble heads.
L:  I've seen those.  I haven't seen them in years.  They were big in the sixties I think.
R:  Yeah, but I guess the Mets give out -- like, you have the New York Mets, they give out something.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess.  I -- I'm remembering them from when I was a little kid.
R:  Right.
L:  Baseball players, and then they came out with little dogs that, you know, put them in the back of the car and their heads bobbed up and down.
R:  Yeah, that's what -- they're called bobble heads.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  And some of the games they give out the free bobble heads.  You know, it's -- a company sponsors it and they give them away.  Like Model[?] gives out towels or shirts --
L:  Mm.
R:  But the Philly's own it.  I don't know what they do -- I guess in New York they do the same thing.
L:  The last time I was at a baseball game I think was about nineteen eighty one or two --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- when it was back in [LAUGH] there was still a team in Baltimore.
R:  Was that when the Yank- -- was that when the New York Yankees were famous?
L:  Um, you know, I don't know.  I was living in Washington DC at the time --
R:  Oh.  Okay.
L:  -- and I had friends -- ah, friends from Maryland who were big, ah, what was the Baltimore team?
R:  Right.
L:  Was it the Red -- the Baltimore --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's the Boston Red Sox, I can't remember what the Baltimore team was called.  Ah, Orioles.
R:  The Orioles.
L:  The Orioles.  Um, so were big Orioles fans and they took me to -- I went with them to a couple of games.
R:  Right.
L:  But one game.  But the last game I went to was really boring and after that [LAUGH] I decided that was the end of baseball for me.
R:  Right.  So.  If they want -- if they want more money, let them have it, I guess.  I don't care.
L:  Yeah.  I don't know whether we can talk any more on this subject.  Ah -- how many of these calls have you done?
R:  Ah, this is my second one.  I did one yesterday.  I did it on the, ah, what was your reaction after the nine one one incident?  And that was really great because we were on a trip and we were there, the day of the nine one one incident.
L:  You were in New York?
R:  No, we were on a trip, and we heard it happened.
L:  Ah.
R:  We went "wow" when it happened.
L:  I see.
R:  So that was the subject yesterday, nine one one.  Is that what your subject was?
L:  Ah, this is my first call.  I just signed up this morning.
R:  Oh, this is my second one.  I got one more to do.
L:  [LAUGH] When did you sign up?
R:  I signed up the day before yesterday.
L:  Oh, okay, so it looks like they do them right away.
R:  Yeah, but you don't have to do them -- you don't have to do them in a row, they said, but I may as well do them and get the rev- -- you know 
L:  Yeah.  No, I was surprised um, to hear -- to get the call so quickly.  I -- 'cause I only signed up, I think, one o'clock this afternoon.
R:  Yeah, they gave us -- yeah, the person I spoke to from yesterday was from California.
L:  Hm.
R:  And this is closer.  This is New York.
L:  Yeah.  I think they have us --
R:  I don't think you talk to somebody from the same -- I don't know, do you get two people from the same city?
L:  You know, I can't say, this is my first call.
R:  I don't know.
L:  I don't think it matters really.  I think it's just as long as the people don't know each other.
R:  No -- I -- well, do they give -- I don't think -- no -- aren't you supposed to be from different c- -- I don't know.  Yesterday was California, today it was New York.  I don't know who it's going to be tomorrow.
L:  Did you speak with a man or a woman yesterday?
R:  A m- -- ah, Jim, it was a man.
L:  Okay.  Because when I saw the add on the internet --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it looked like they were recruiting men, so I was surprised --
R:  Now, they're -- they're recruiting men now.  They need men.
L:  Oh, there's -- there aren't enough men have signed up for the --
R:  Right --
L:  -- study.
R:  -- I got Jim -- I didn't get a lady yet.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I wonder what I'll get -- I don't know.
L:  Oh, it's all random.
R:  I want -- yeah -- but how -- well -- I have a [inaudible] but -- and after -- and then when the ten minutes are up, the phone disconnects, you know that?
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  The phone stops automatically when the ten -- they'll tell you when the ten minutes are up.
L:  Oh okay.  Have you been ch- -- watching the clock?  'Cause I didn't --
R:  No, you don't have to watch the clock, they're watching it.
L:  Yeah.  I'm just curious.  Do we have like, two minutes left, five minutes left?
R:  We have like three minutes left.
L:  About three minutes.  Okay.
R:  Do they know what we're talking about?
L:  Um, apparently they record these things and listen to them.
