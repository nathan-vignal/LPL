L:  Hi, I'm Lisa.
R:  Hi Lisa, I'm Melanie.
L:  How are you?
R:  Good, how are you?
L:  I'm okay, thank you.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I guess the topic is how did September eleventh affect you?
L:  Oh, man [LAUGH] -- it just made me realize that time is not as long as -- I guess, just taking things for granted, I don't do that anymore --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- trying to spend more time with my family --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and instead of investing in stock -- what I was doing -- I don't really do that anymore --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I just, you know, well, if we have money, I spend it -- if we want something, we get it, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  [inaudible] you know, whatever, we're just taking it one day at a time and trying to get more closer to God, actually --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- is very important right now, so, we've been doing that as well.
R:  Um, did you all [MN] -- know anybody that -- that died in that?
L:  Um, no, I didn't have -- well, I have family in New York, but I don't have anyone that worked in the towers.
R:  Oh, that's scary though, to have family --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- in New York, when that happened.
L:  I know, 'cause they were all just -- oh, that was a mess, mm --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that was really a mess.
R:  Yeah.  I remember my dad calling me that morning, it was about nine, and saying, [SIGH], you know, I was at work, and he said something like, you know, "Hey, a -- a plane just crashed into the tower, and ..." -- 'cause he used to live in New York right there --
L:  Oh, man.
R:  -- years ago, and he was -- he's like, "I wonder, you know --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- just how -- how did that happen?", and then like -- like  we were talking about it, and like, you know, [several inaudible words] he was like, "Oh my gosh", he goes, "That can't be ...", you know, the second one hit, he's like, "That can't be, you know, just an accident" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it just, and I -- I tell you what, at work we spent like the next -- I mean, we glued to that TV, we didn't do any work.
L:  Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, you can forget that, yeah, noone did -- 'cause I was at work as well, and it was like, "What is happening?".
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I was like, "Oh no, uh-uh" -- I was --
R:  Well, I remember, you know, especially like, um, we watched for so long because it was like, well, okay -- and the following days was like, surely they're going to find somebody.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  You know, anybody, just anybody they're going to pull out, and --
L:  I know.
R:  -- and I -- we had a, you know, a slight hope when they -- when they found those firefighters, when they found, well, they -- they were already okay, they had -- they were working on the product and they got, you know, trapped in there, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, well, I finally had to stop watching the TV after about a week 'cause I just couldn't -- I mean, it was so depressing.
L:  It really was --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and it was like, that was all on TV there for a while --
R:  Yeah, and that was all you saw, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and as much as you wanted to watch it, you -- I just couldn't do it anymore.
L:  Yeah, yeah, I couldn't -- I -- after maybe a coupla days I think I stopped watching, 'cause it was so sad and people standing around out there, and it was just -- it was too sad --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it was really too sad, I mean, these people -- [several inaudible words] people were in there working, and then they were showing it on TV when it first happened, and the people jumping out the window, I mean, what -- you know, I wonder what were they thinking?
R:  Yeah.
L:  What was going through their head, you know, I'm get- -- oh, god --
R:  And all those --
L:  -- that was a mess.
R:  Yeah, and all the -- the firefighters and personnel, I just -- I don't know, that was just a horrible, horrible thing.
L:  It really was, it really, really was.  I mean, there -- there are really no words to explain that day because, oh, it was a mess.
R:  Well, I think too -- ah, we were kinda -- you know, I -- I kinda thought about Oklahoma City when that happened.
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  And it was like -- we -- I remember Oklahoma City so clearly to this day, too.
L:  God, I know.
R:  But, I mean, I never thought that anything could, like, be as bad as what Oklahoma City was.
L:  Me -- that -- that's what I said too, when I saw that 'cause they showing it on TV, and showing how the planes just went straight for the buildings --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm like, those people he had working for him were absolutely crazy.
R:  Well, and those folks on those planes.
L:  Oh, I know -- I know, they were just, oh ...
R:  That -- I mean, that one that called his wife, that gentleman, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, oh, I was just like, "Oh, my god".
L:  Oh, man.
R:  And that poor -- did you hear about that lady, she was a nine one one operator --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh ...
L:  Oh, I know, yeah.
R:  And that poor lady, just sitting, like, not been able to do anything --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and knowing what's going on, and not knowing what's happening to him, or what --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, what's gonna happen next.
L:  God.
R:  I just can't even, I don't know ...
L:  Yeah, it was a mess, that was a [inaudible] mess, I mean, I just don't see how they can just get up and say, "Okay, well, I'll do it -- I'll just go, I'm gonna take my life", I -- I couldn't do that.
R:  No.
L:  I couldn't do that.
R:  I -- I don't know, I haven't been faced the situation I guess, where I could say that, but I don't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I just can't -- I mean, you know, it -- I don't know [LAUGH].
L:  Mm mm, I know.
R:  And it -- and it was like -- it was so hard -- I'm not sure if you have kids or not?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  But, I have a nine year old son, and it was so hard to explain to him, you know --
L:  Why did they do it?  They have so many questions --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and my kids were teenagers and they were still asking questions, and it was like, "I don't know, you know, let's just pray for 'em and let's just ...", I mean, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Just really, really hard, and it's -- and that's bad when something like that happen, I mean, it takes an effect on everyone --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- I mean, everyone, and it's just like [MN] --
R:  I tell you what happened -- I work at a major university, and the day after that happened -- we have like a Muslim center on campus --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, I mean, it -- the -- the backlash was fast, because the very next day we had a report that we had over twenty five people on campus that had gone into this Muslim center and dragged these people out and beat 'em.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  And I mean, it was just awful, it was like, okay, you know, these people aren't even, you know --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- they were just grabbing anybody who happened to be like, a slightly different color, you know, and just, you know -- just going after 'em --
L:  Oh, my god.
R:  -- and I'm like, see that -- you don't even know -- like with Oklahoma City, they thought that that was terrorists, and that guy was one of our own --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and I thought at the time, I thought, man, they're -- they're just beating these people and they don't even know who they are -- they have no idea --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what nationality they are -- they really are.
L:  And they were just --
R:  And, they're just assuming -- what if it ends up being one of our own people again, you know?
L:  I know, I know, they were just mad -- they were so mad about that.
R:  I know it, but it was just like, oh my gosh, you know?
L:  Yeah, that was horrible, I mean, we can't [inaudible] --
R:  Just making it worse.
L:  -- you can't fine another person for what somebody else did, just because they're the same nationality, or whatever [SIGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:   That's just crazy.  I mean, that man -- I don't -- I don't know if he was the main one behind it, or what, but, he -- I don't know, he can't have a heart, he really can't.
R:  I know.
L:  I mean, that's like innocent people have children, I mean, you -- you can't do that.
R:  Well, and there were kids that were traveling on the plane and stuff like that too, I mean, that were ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- there was a guy that was carrying his what?  His -- what?  Like, three month old daughter with him --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, I just can't even -- oh -- that's like one of my worst fears as a parent though, is like, you know, you're driving in a car, you get in a wreck, and like, your kid is left and you die.
L:  Yeah, exactly, exactly.
R:  Or, like, if you're on a plane -- it's like, what do you do during that last, like --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- thirty seconds alive --
L:  Oh, my --
R:  I mean, how do you comfort your child?
L:  -- goodness, exactly.
R:  I just can't even imagine the terror those poor people felt.
L:  Oh, I know, just them sitting there and seeing it -- this plane's going straight into this building --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's like, [MN] "Well, I can't jump -- what -- what am I gonna ...", oh, [MN].
R:  Well, our -- our firefighter team in Columbia, they -- they -- we have a Boon County fire district, and they, um, you know, we have a bagpipe brigade that is on that fire district and, like -- like, a week after, they did like a little ceremony, and they played Amazing Grace, and I'm telling you what, I mean, it was like, it brought tears to your eyes [LAUGH].
L:  Oh yeah, oh yeah, I can only imagine.
R:  I think from -- from now on, whenever I hear that song played on bagpipes ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I'm just gonna tear up everytime.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And I'm definitely not a crier, but boy --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that one just gets ya.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I don't know.  I -- those guys and ladies that -- that helped out, you know, in the way of ambulances --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and firefighters, shoot, and -- and even police personnel, shoot, they really did [inaudible] ...
L:  Oh, yeah, they did a great job up there, they really did --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, that was a just amaz- -- it's like, everybody just came together --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it's like, man ...
R:  Well, and that's what we need to see more of, I think anymore.
L:  Exactly
R:  Is, you don't really see, like, you know, people kind of banding together -- I live in small town and so if -- if somebody gets hurt, or needs something, our town kinda backs 'em up anyway.
L:  See, that's good.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, and I don't -- I'm not sure what other areas do, but we live in a very small community --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so, it's kinda like, you know -- you know.
L:  Yeah, you know your neighbors and everybody --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and you know, everybody look out for each other, and that's how it should be regardless of where you are.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that's what I mean -- we are around in my own neighborhood too, we just kinda look out for one another --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But you, I mean, all neighborhoods are not like that, because some people see something going on outside, they just close their blinds and turn the light out, 'cause --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- they don't want anything to do with it.
R:  Well, I think [MN] -- I think that September eleventh is -- was good in one respect 'cause it made people think about that.
L:  Exactly.
R:  We've gotten so far away from, you know, helping out your neighbor --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or, you know, respecting your neighbor, you know, and giving assistance when needed --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's like, well, that's not my problem, you know? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's, you know, it's their problem, but it really is, I mean, I respect the person that's gonna come and tell me my kid is across the street doing something he shouldn't be doing.
L:  Exactly.
R:  That's hard for them to do.
L:  [MN] Yeah, yeah.
R:  But, I wanna know.
L:  Me, too.
R:  You know, we gotta whole community here, that kinda watches out for the kids --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and what they do, and [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- that old saying, "It take a village to raise a child", boy --
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  -- in our town, it's right, and those kids hate it, but ...
L:  But, yeah, well, they'll be all right --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- they'll be all right [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, you have to look at it like that, 'cause if my child was doing something wrong, I'd want somebody to tell me, definitely.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  I don't know, I just feel like, September eleventh's really changed a -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- a whole lotta stuff, and [MN] -- a lot of negative stuff, but a lot of stuff has been for the good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, and -- and I think you're right -- the family's the most important thing, and --
L:  [MN] Exactly, I mean, they have to look at that regardless, because I mean, who know that those people -- that was gonna be their last morning, saying goodbye to their kids, or whatever --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, you never know -- you just never know, I mean you can leave, go out your house and get in a a- car accident and that's it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's it, and the last words are very important, because, you know ... it's just -- I don't know, it was just a -- oh, it was a change of life I think for everyone.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Everyone.
R:  Yeah, I -- I definitely think you were right, I mean, it -- I remember watching the -- the reports from overseas, you know, and how, just, devastated those folks were too, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, for us, and it was like, you know, the whole world's kinda pulling together and --
L:  Oh, yeah, it was just like, I mean, we like stopped at that moment, when you saw that plane first -- my heart just still, I'm like, "Oh, my goodness" ...
R:  Yeah, and those -- those were pretty awful images.
L:  [SIGH] Mhm.
R:  I think those of us who, you know, who saw those will probably live 'til the day we -- you know, remember 'em to the day we die.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So ...
L:  Oh, definitely, I mean, you can't ever forget that and I still think about these families and that one lady, I think, her husband died in there, she was at the dinner for -- ah, the President's dinner, I think -- she had had a little --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- newborn baby, or something.
R:  Yeah, the blond lady?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I thought that was nice of President Bush to invite her down there just to take part in her life, you know, like that -- that was very nice of him.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And she was -- I don't know, she was just a total wreck, I just couldn't imagine -- mm ...
R:  No, I -- yeah, I -- I don't even [LAUGH] ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  I can't even possibly begin to comprehend the kind of ...
L:  Exactly.
R:  I -- and I think President Bush did a good job too, throughout the whole thing.
L:  Well, he did, he did a good job after all, he really did.
R:  And it seemed like he presented, kinda like a strong front, which I think is what we kinda ...
