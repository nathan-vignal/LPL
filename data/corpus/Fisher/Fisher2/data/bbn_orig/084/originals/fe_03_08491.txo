L:  Hello.
R:  Hello, hi, I'm Anna.
L:  Hi, I'm Cathy, how are you?
R:  Okay, how are you?
L:  Oh, fairly good [LAUGH] --
R:  [MN] [SIGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Now, you been doing this very long?
R:  'Scuse me?
L:  Have you been doing this very much?
R:  [SIGH] Ah, I've been -- this is my second call -- my second --
L:  Mine too [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, so the question was about, ah, professional athletes?  And ...
L:  That's right, hm, how we feel about 'em.
R:  [LAUGH] They make a lot of money.
L:  Huh?
R:  They make a lot of money, I [MN] -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I missed my calling [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, they're making a lot more money than most people do --
R:  Yeah, they're making --
L:  -- working every day.
R:  -- they're making a lot of money playing a game that they love.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And getting paid for it.  
L:  Wouldn't it be nice if we all could do that?  Get paid for what we --
R:  Oh, definitely.
L:   -- like -- like -- what we'd really like to do [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, definitely, I wish I could.
L:  [MN] Really?
R:  Yeah, 'specially being a -- a -- a housewife, I stay -- I -- I don't work right now, ah, I babysit --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- but, I stay home and cook and clean -- I wish I'd get paid for it.
L:  Oh, yeah [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I'm ah -- I'm -- I'm disabled and I'm tr- trying to get my disability --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I'd like to be able to get paid to do something I like to do.
R:  Right, right.
L:  If I were able [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, boy.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know, they make you wait for disability.
L:  Yeah, but, ah, I guess there's a lot of risk in the sports too, so I guess it's the reason why their compensation's so great [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you watch sports at all?
L:  Well, I do off and on -- now, they're talking about the strikes -- I guess they're talking about like in baseball and stuff like that.
R:  Right.
L:  Ah, I get into wrestling more than I do any of them.
R:  Oh, I used to love wrestling, I haven't watched it in ages.
L:  Oh.  It's still [MN] -- it's still phoney anymore.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [MN] I used to listen --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- to the Reds games -- listen to the Reds a lot, or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and basketball -- college basketball --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- but, I think these are the major leagues they're talking about, ain't they?  [SIGH] 
R:  I -- well, where you from?
L:  Ah, Kentucky.
R:  I'm from New York, so we got the Yankees --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and the Mets.
L:  Oh.
R:  Matthew, shh -- ah, if you hear a little boy screaming --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's ah, I watch a handicapped child --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and sometimes he gets excited with the cartoons, so h- --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- he may scream, so if you hear screaming that's what it is.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, I've been around [inaudible] that does that too -- ah ...
R:  Boy, sometimes he does, sometimes he don't, or if he does, he screams very loud -- depends on the --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- the cartoon that he's watching.
L:  Oh, gets excited, huh?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And you're in New York?
R:  I'm in New York, so we have the Yankees, and --
L:  Well, I guess --
R:  -- there was a whole big thing with the cable company, ah, one of the cable companies here -- they wanted to -- everybody to pay to watch the games --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, like, there was a whole big thing [MN], "Why should we have to pay", you know, they --
L:  Well, you already play -- pay for the service anyways, why --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- would you wanna pay extra?
R:  Yep, wh -- why -- you know, it's like, forget about it, you know, I'd rather go to a game then.
L:  Yeah, well, you know, if you buy, ah, like, on the pay per view they're -- they're outrageous.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Oh, lordy.  And I know, you know, some of them down here is like fifty dollars just to watch a -- a boxing match, or, you know, I don't think there's any ball games on pay per view yet, but --
R:  No, not yet, I think that's what they're trying to do.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, then the -- the -- the teams will make money from it then.  How much money do -- do they want from their fans?  [NOISE]
L:  I don't know, it seem like they were making pretty of money right now, you know?
R:  [MN] I know a girl -- her and her father have, um, [LIPSMACK] season tickets for the Jets --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and it's two thousand dollars a year they pay. 
L:  Yeah, and [MN] -- is it --
R:  And that's a lot of money.
L:  -- that's a lot of money to spend on something like that, especially when you don't have much of an income.
R:  Yep, yep.
L:  I mean, even -- I've noticed even the local, ah, like, the area high schools and stuff --
R:  Right.
L:  -- their prices is high on their games, too -- I mean, not like -- nothing compared to, you know, the major leagues, or the professionals --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but it seemed like the pe- -- I guess they know people's gonna pay it, so they charge it.
R:  Right, I know -- ah, New York has two minor leagues --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- one here on Stanton Island, and one in Brooklyn --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the [MN] and I -- the tickets are like, [MN] expensive, you know --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- if you don't have [MN]-- for minor league --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, sometimes, you know, you -- you go out with five kids, or five people, and you know, it's like twenty dollars -- it's like a hundred dollars for tickets --
L:  Uh-huh, but they [MN] --
R:  -- for a minor league.
L:  -- do they offer the season passes too?
R:  I guess they do.
L:  Oh, you know, they got money coming from that and then the -- the -- just out and out buying the tickets, you know, they're making a fortune off us.
R:  [NOISE] Yes, they are.
L:  And I know it takes money to operate, ah, and pay the players, but my goodness.
R:  [NOISE] But the players are making like, over a million [NOISE] dollars a year, I think [several inaudible words] --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- between the basketball players, the [MN] ah, the baseball players -- they're making [SIGH] -- well [inaudible] -- the baseball's what?  Eight weeks, nine weeks into the se- --
L:  Ah, yeah, about that.
R:  -- something like that?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [COUGH] So, for nine weeks, they're making, like, three, four hundred thousand, if not more.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, and where are they getting this from?  From the -- the -- the fans --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they're paying for these tickets.
L:  And the more they raise, the more they can pay the fans.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, see, ah, they're on strike to get a raise, or get different, what, ah, benefits and stuff [SIGH] -- who's gonna pay for it?  The fans.
R:  The fans, and I think it's so unfair.
L:  Huh.
R:  You know, it really is.
L:  [MN] And I think, you know --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- it's like, ah, politics --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they get carried away with it.
R:  Oh definitely, here, we got a new mayor, after Giuliani --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- oh my, oh, he's [MN] -- he's raising parking tickets --
L:  Oh, my.
R:  -- he's giving out stu- -- like, you ever see the milk crates?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that the milk comes in [MN] -- that -- you get caught sitting on one -- this guy got a hundred dollar ticket.
L:  You're kidding, just for sitting on that thing?
R:  No, this mayor's so bad, he's ticketing everybody for e- -- the littlest thing.
L:  Oh, my goodness -- [inaudible] --
R:  So, politics, forget about it -- that's a whole different topic.
L:  Well, what has happened to, ah, the freedom?  Huh. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  Those things are unnecessary, I mean --
R:  I think -- they definitely raised the parking tickets, if you get a -- a parking ticket here in New York, it'll cost you over a hundred dollars.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  It's fifty four dollars for the ticket, then sixty dollars for the, um, penalty --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and -- and there's a few dollars more, it's like, over a hundred bucks.
L:  [SIGH] Well, you know, ah, basically that's what's sports is getting to be -- they're getting to be a politics [MN] scenario.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, you know, they think well, you know, we do this and we do that, we should be compensated for it, you know --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- and it all comes back, ah, like on the taxes and stuff --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- who pays for it?  It's the fans.
R:  Yep.
L:  Course I know, they pay taxes too, but, still.
R:  No, I -- [MN] if they don't -- I tell you, the middle class could pay more, [MN] you know, it's like the -- not the season pass holders more, I think like the little guys that, like, can't really afford the -- the season pass because it's -- it's a outrageous price, it's thee fans that are going to bleachers -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- those are the ones that are being treated unfair, because those tickets go up too.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  You know, [MN] so you're talking about a working man, or a working family that wanna take their kids to see a game, and can't afford it.
L:  Yeah, and a lot -- [MN] you know, they [MN], in the long run, I think if they keep the prices reasonable they'd have a [MN] -- just as much coming in --
R:  Well, that's what --
L:  -- 'cause more people would come -- be able to afford to come to see the games, and, ah, become -- ah, they would come more often.
R:  I -- I went once in my lifetime to a Met game, when my son was seven years old.
L:  Really?
R:  And when he -- when we went there, a hotdog was five dollars.
L:  Now does that -- is that covered by the baseball, or is that [MN] covered by a concessions dealer?
R:  That's the concessions.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Now, I don't know if that's owned by the arenas, or privately owned?
L:  A lot of them, the concessions are like, independent vendors.
R:  Well, see, I don't know how that work -- [several inaudible words] --
L:  But, they'd probably get a percentage of it through the arena though.
R:  Oh, yeah, definitely.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, like, you -- you wanna buy team souvenirs -- forget about it -- it was outrageous.
L:  That's true, I mean, I've never been to a professional game, but I know, you know, I've heard -- read the +reviews and stuff, you know, and the -- the people in the stadiums and stuff, when the games are going on -- humming- -- a humongous number, especially when it's, ah, down to the you know, playoffs and stuff like that.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, you know, them -- they're raking in the money on that.
R:  Oh, definitely, definitely.
L:  Of course, every business is a money making business.
R:  And then if your team is in the playoff, or the world series --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- all the stores carry their merchan- -- the team's merchandise, and, to go out and buy, like, a -- let's say for example, like, ah, the Red Socks or the Met -- Yankees, or the Mets, or, um, ah --
L:  The Braves[?].
R:  -- oh god, the Dol- ah, the California Dodgers --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- one jersey will cost you fifty five dollars.
L:  Yeah, well you think --
R:  Because it has the team that --
L:  -- think too, about the times lots on their advertising during [inaudible] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, like p-, ah -- Pepsi and Coke have a competition every year about who gets, the, you know, the highest paying spot --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- and, you know, they don't come cheap for a -- a thirty second slot, or fifteen second slot.
R:  I know, and who pays for that?  The consumer.
L:  Yeah, [SIGH] --
R:  The consumer --
L:  -- it all goes right back to the consumer [LAUGH].
R:  --  'cause they get paid a lot of money for a commercial.
L:  It's -- it's all right back to the consumer.  But, if the consumer's willing to pay it, they gonna keep on paying it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They gonna keep on collecting it.
R:  Yep.
L:  As long as they let 'em.  [SIGH] But, you know, I -- I mean, sports is enjoyable, but, you know, making money ain't all there is to it.
R:  No, [inaudible].
L:  To me, I think, it's the --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- competition and sportsmanship.
R:  Right, there is no more sportsmanship.
L:  No.
R:  No more, like it used to be.
L:  No.
R:  You know, with any sports really, I don't see it anymore, like -- like, I remember, like, growing up [MN] -- you know, players used to take time out and meet their fans, today I don't think they even do that.
L:  Uh-uh, I don't think so, not much anymore, and if it is, it's all publicized so much -- it's to build their character up.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's not for just for wanting to -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's for a benefit.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And ...
R:  But, some players I know, for benefits, they'll do like, ah, there are a couple of players, I know there's one player who has an autistic son --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and he does special events for au- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for the autistic foundation, and for the --
L:  Uh-huh, but [MN] -- but would he do it if he didn't have a son in that condition?
R:  I wonder.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I don't know -- I really don't know.
L:  I mean, you have to really be there to ...
