L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hi, this is Mystique.  Hello?
L:  Yo, what's up, this is One AK.
R:  Uh, what was the question again?
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I was gonna ask you the same thing.  I think it's concerning, um, athletes and, um, how much they get today, do they deserve, um, how much money they get paid.
R:  Well -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- knowing that I'm ahead and all, I mean, the ones that just sit on their ass on a bench I don't think they deserve as much but as for the ones that, you know, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean, is actually out there playing [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think, I mean, it's a bit much but, I mean --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, but they deserve it to me basically -- some of them deserve it anyway.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I don't know about all of them, you know.
L:  Oh, do you watch sports?
R:  Um, I'm into basketball mostly.
L:  Okay, yeah, I'm -- I used into ball until, um, the Nicks came at the playoffs [LAUGH] --
R:  Uh, well, uh, New Jersey won the playoffs.
L:  I mean, even so that was [inaudible].
R:  I'm just glad that the Sixers didn't win the playoffs, that's all.
L:  Did you say you had the Sixers anyway?
R:  I'm just glad they didn't win --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I mean 'cause, I mean, I'm in Philly and I really hate the Sixers, I mean, just because of the simple fact, I mean, they make it look like Iverson is the god of the team and I don't like that.  I mean --
L:  Oh well --
R:  -- the team actually proved that they would win without him but, I mean, they still making it seems like, "Oh, oh he the bomb" you know what I'm saying?
L:  Yeah.  You don't think he deserve the money he get though?
R:  You know what [LAUGH] because I don't like him I would say, "No" but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I mean truthfully --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I know that he do deserve the money he on -- he -- he makes, um, a year.
L:  Oh --
R:  He deserve his money, you know.
L:  Yeah, I feel like --
R:  Not every --
L:  -- I think the big stars do deserve the money that they get because they -- they're popular --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, um, the amount of money that a lot of, um, corporate people are making also though --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- doesn't compare to how much they're getting paid, like, first of, like, LeBron James, uh, you know who LeBron James is, he's the high school kid he just signed --
R:  Yeah, I heard of him, yeah.
L:  Yeah, he's getting a ninety million dollar contract from Nike but the --
R:  Yes!  I was so jealous -- what?
L:  -- and -- and people think it's so much money but the thing is that Nike's gonna -- the -- the return that they get obviously is going to be a lot more than ninety million dollars --
R:  True, true.
L:  -- and nobody's really commenting on that so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I think, you know what I mean, um --
R:  The reason why I thought it was a lot was, I mean, because I w- -- I mean, 'cause he and I basically the same age, you know, nobody offer me no ninety million dollar contract, you know what I'm saying?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I mean, like, that's a lot of money, you know.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, you just -- oh, you work hard though.  How -- how old are you?
R:  You're pushing -- um, I ain't pushing that, I'm eighteen basically so ...
L:  Okay, [NOISE] are you from Philly?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay, yeah, I'm, um, I'm twenty, I'm from, um, DC.
R:  Okay.
L:  I mean, I'm actually from Brooklyn but I go to school in DC so that's where I'm at right now.
R:  Okay.  Let's see, what else?  Now, they said you need to talk about this for eight minutes --
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- what else do I have to say?  Um --
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] You all watch any other sports?
R:  Uh, I like, um, hockey because they fight --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but basically, I mean, that's about it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I ususally, um, watch basketball or extreme sport and the year, um, when they're, um, when the, uh, what the hell is their name [NOISE] that football, man, [LIPSMACK] when the Eagles, you know, I mean, when they was, I mean, finally about to win the playoffs I was watching them, you know, and kinda rooting --
L:  Oh okay.
R:  -- for them so ...
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, well maybe that's a -- a pretty clear case I think, yeah, the players do deserve it -- their money that they get, they probably deserve more.
R:  Not -- excuse me?
L:  They probably deserve more money.
R:  Actually I don't think so, no, oh, they make it -- enough.  I don't think they deserve any more, come on --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- there's people out here who ain't making a damn thing, you know what I'm saying?  I mean, how about we contribute to them.
L:  You right but, um --
R:  No, I don't believe that at all.  They're making a couple of million a year, you tell me they deserve more.  Just, I mean, all they doing is running ball advertising.  God knows, I mean, they got they own sneakers coming out this year they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Come on, no!  And they --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- doing enough, they is doing enough.
L:  That's not only -- they marketing themselves and, I mean, it's a popular sport if -- if being a doctor was something that we could watch on TV and the doctors come out with his sneakers and they got millions --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- of dollars, people would -- people would not be upset, you know what I mean, it's just that that's a field that they -- what they, uh, they really be in, you know what I mean?
R:  Okay.  Well, you say they deserve, uh, more [LIPSMACK] money, are you saying that, like, um, like they deserved to be paid more or -- or like should they go out and do something to earn more?  I mean, like, get a sneakers or something 'cause I don't -- 'cause I'd be sur- -- I do not think that they deserve to be paid more, if they want --
L:  Oh not, not no reason.
R:  -- more, oh, get more.
L:  Oh no, no, no.  Yeah, not all they -- they deserve to be paid for -- for -- for what they're earning, that's all I'm saying.
R:  Okay.  There you have --
L:  So, for, uh, popular players, yeah, they do -- do deserve it and -- bench warmers and things of that sort, oh, they probably don't deserve the money that they get but --
R:  I don't think so, I don't think so.
L:  Jus- just the simple fact that they made it there just -- yeah.
R:  I don't think they deserve it but, I mean, I could be on -- a bench warmer 'cause I'm pretty tall, I mean, I could be a bench warmer but it -- it -- it's not the simple fact --
L:  Oh [NOISE] --
R:  -- that I'm not going and sitting on no bench while, I mean, they're getting big profile and I'm just on the bench --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know what I'm saying?  No.
L:  So, why you all -- why you all don't go join WNBA? 
R:  I think it's for men basically and, I mean, ninety percent of those women are --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- gay and I don't have time for it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I basic- I basically think it's for men.  I do not think it's a feminine sport.
L:  Mm.
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah, they don't -- they don't get paid that much anyway.  They get paid regular star like thirty thousand and all that.
R:  So, they discriminate against the W, um, NBA.
L:  Mm, they don't discriminate it's just that --
R:  It's discrimination, it's no --
L:  No, the --
R:  -- the NBA get millions and the W -- I mean, get, um, um, um, thousands, that's discrimination.
L:  All right, what -- what's the last WNBA game that you watched?
R:  [MN]
L:  Never.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's why they're not getting paid a lot 'cause they're not even --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- able to market what they're doing, you know what I mean?
R:  Whatever, I mean, I -- I'm, I mean, [inaudible] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what I being seeing, like, them on the news, I mean, like the -- the, um, um, the place you're looking a bit for, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, but I don't -- I don't watch that all but I still think, you know, they could do with something else, you know, you know, I don't know.
L:  Mhm, mm.
R:  I don't watch WNBA.  I don't --
L:  'Cause -- exactly you don't watch it so that's why they get what they get.
R:  [MN]
L:  They get paid, like, a regular person [LAUGH].
R:  Oh no, it's just not floating my boat I don't find it attractive at all so I don't watch it. [LIPSMACK]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, a lot of people feel like that.
R:  But other than that I watch, um, like, extreme sports.
L:  Yeah, I don't all that.
R:  Like where those guys, like, uh, they gotta -- gotta -- gotta lift, like, trucks and all that bull, you know.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  I watch that, I mean --
L:  Do they get -- they get paid well?
R:  [SIGH] I know they don't get paid no millions a year.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know that but, I mean, it's just -- it's, uh, um, it's really fun to watch.  Extreme sports usually someone, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- whatever, uh --
L:  Yeah, I'm only an all basketball.  That's it. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  That's it.
R:  These are wide -- they're a variety.
L:  You know, you know, I will watch -- I will watch -- no, I don't tend to watch that either.
R:  What?
L:  I was gonna say tennis.
R:  Tennis?
L:  Just 'cause, um --
R:  I watch tennis, I mean, just to lo- you know, I mean, I wouldn't -- you know, if there's nothing else going I just sit there, you know, watch a little tennis --
L:  Yeah, that's right.  But the Williams sisters they get paid mad money too, though, right? [NOISE]
R:  Mhm, you know, I don't know.
L:  I don't know how much they make but --
R:  I don't know.
L:  Uh --
R:  But I'm like, like [MN] -- I be watching pool though.  You even seen like the pool games on TV?
