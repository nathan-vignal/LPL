L:  Hi, my name is Sandy.
R:  Oh, I'm -- I'm April.
L:  Hi.
R:  Um, you wanna start?
L:  Yeah, sure --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- let's go for it [LAUGH].
R:  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, um, well, I mean, I would just say that -- that -- they -- that um, they're not role models any more, the athletes -- they don't deserve to take the salaries they're getting.
L:  [SIGH] I agree, I agree, um, there's too much money involved [SIGH], you know, I know they get battered around and beat up and stuff, but that's the name of the game, [SIGH] but I mean, what do they make?  A million bucks a year, something like that?
R:  Yeah, and all they do is blow it, and they run around, and like, you know, go to -- do bad things and like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they -- they -- and then they charge money to get their autograph signed --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and all their endorsements, I mean, it's like they're making money on that anyhow, with the sneakers and everything else --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so, it's like, not about the game, it's about the money.
L:  [SIGH] Now, it's -- it's showing the young kids of today, you know, how to do drugs, how to do date rape, how to make money off of everything [SIGH], it's, ah -- it's all showing the wrong image.
R:  Yeah, even the families are now getting involved and getting in scandals now -- the families are --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- g- g- g- getting it, and like, they're not going to school anymore either, I mean, now their highschool they even go and do it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I mean, they're showing the kids all this -- [inaudible] fast career, but you can burn out really fast too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, they're not showing them and that's -- they're not -- they're letting little kids see you can just rely on this and nothing else, and that's it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I mean, I don't know -- [inaudible] it's -- it's -- it's a hard thing.
L:  I don't think they should be able to strike, you know, um, there hasn't been, ah, good unions for many, many, many years, and for them to be able to strike and start with what we call America's pastime, just so they can make a few more dollars, so they can buy more drugs, or, you know, get into --
R:  I mean, there are good athletes out there, but I mean, there seems to be more bad ones --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- than good ones, so [several inaudible words]...
L:  Well, you know, the old saying -- everytime the good always suffer for the bad.
R:  Oh, well, it's also ticket prices too, I mean it's so expensive to go a game as it is with all the food prices, and everything else --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then ...
L:  Yeah, you go there, and you buy a small Coke and it's three dollars.
R:  Yeah, so I mean, it's like they're making all this money, and -- and stuff --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so, and they don't always play great ball anyhow, I mean, now they trade them so fast and you can't even get to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- know who the person is.
L:  And with the way security is, you know, um, you gotta be almost strip searched to go a game anymore.
R:  Yeah, it's true, I mean, you know, I mean I -- I mean, I guess that's all for good, but, you know, you can't get near them, and it's like they -- they don't really talk to the fans anymore, I mean everything is through their agent, or the publicist --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or ...
L:  Yeah, well, that's -- I don't think that's their fault as much as it is what's going on these days, you know?
R:  Yeah, I know it's about security and stuff too, but then --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when some of them just, you know, they -- that's how they get these, ah, hot heads, you know they [inaudible].
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  No, it all goes to their heads, you know, I think they all start out like, about the fans, but then all of a sudden they throw -- this money is thrown at them --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- that they just don't know what to do.
L:  -- and it goes to their heads.
R:  They don't figure -- they forget about the fans, they just forget, then they don't play as good ball and -- and stuff, because it's all about the paycheck.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, they're not -- they're not as access- accessible as they used to be to the fans.
L:  Right, right.
R:  You know?
L:  Even with um, the ah, what do they call it?  The, ah, wrestling?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, [SIGH] I mean [SIGH], it's gotten really bad, um, you know, they -- they want more money, um, they're, I don't know -- you see a lot of kids -- a lot more kids watching wrestling than you do in ah, baseball and football -- least I see it anyway.
R:  I mean, I don't it -- you know, I'm not a real big sports fan, but I just --
L:  Me neither.
R:  -- you know, I don't really watch it that much, but, I mean, I know that kids used to enjoy it, and they'd talk about the great games and stuff, but it doesn't seem like they know what they're talking about any more.
L:  No.
R:  You know, they've known them from the TV, or maybe, whatever bad thing they did in the paper --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- see I don't really -- you know, I mean, I know, like, maybe, you know, maybe starting out, you know, I don't know what they make.
L:  Oh, I don't either.
R:  But, you know.
L:  I've been to, um -- oh, it was about two years ago, I went to a hockey game and the seats were bad, and, you know, the people there, they tried to incite the players to fight, so it's not just the players, it's these fans these days, too.
R:  Well, you know about the fans -- like the fan that went and I don't know, what'd they do?  They beat up the referee --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because they made a bad call --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I mean, I mean, they get drunk at these ball parks -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- I mean, I know the -- the fans want action, but ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, you know, [inaudible] I don't know, maybe they're both -- maybe everyone's bad, I don't know, maybe it's affecting them, I don't know, but ...
L:  Well, I don't know either, but, [MN] I -- you know, what I saw -- it didn't make it a very pleasurable game, you know?
R:  Well, you know it is a man -- you know, I guess it's a manly thing, you know, they got those networks, like it's the man's show, and I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't know, but ...
L:  Yeah, but they're jealous because we've got Lifetime and it's for women [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, well, now they're trying -- now they're trying to copy us, you know, because they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a lot of guys do stupid little sports things, like, you know, can you lift up a truck on your back, and ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's all -- do you know what I mean?  It's like, you know, and then they strike, and then the fans don't get to go to the games --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and [inaudible], or the game is cut short because of stupidity by the fans anyhow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, [MN] -- they -- they're spoiling -- the game is different now.  I don't under- -- I don't understand it, and then, ah, you know, I mean, I know everyone needs money, and -- but the managers make money, but I mean, I don't know where all the money's going.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] It's going in somebody's pocket.
R:  Yeah, I mean, you know, they claim --
L:  You know?
R:  -- I mean, I don't know what they -- they need all this money for anyhow, when they're making all these endorsements.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  It does make you wonder, you know.
R:  'Cause I mean -- I mean, how much money do you really need?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, everybodys -- it's ridiculous, I mean, I don't know -- you know, I mean, I'd be happy with a million or two dollars --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- a million or two dollars.
L:  Yeah, I think I'd make that last quite a few years.
R:  Yeah, but you know, they make bad investments -- see, that's also true, 'cause did you know they have these people that tell them to do this, and that, and -- they make bad investments, they don't have any money left, and they figure well, we'll just ask for more money.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, I don't think they're earning their money, I just don't think the players are earning the big money they just -- they're getting.
L:  [LIPSMACK] No, I don't think so either, you know.
R:  I mean, um, I don't watch sports on TV and, but I -- I mean, I just see violence really, and I'm not a big sports fan, really.
L:  Well, I'm not either -- I do like wrestling and I do like the -- like, monster trucks and, ah --
R:  Yeah, well, that's like [several inaudible words] --
L:  -- but that's a different kind of sport --
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  -- you know?
R:  I know there's a sports for everything, I mean, I know [several inaudible words] --
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  -- you know, like the guy that lifts the truck, and the fishing ...
L:  Yeah, my husband likes to watch that now and then, but I don't think that's the kind of sports they're talking about.  I think they're basically talking about your baseball, your basketball, your football and your hockey.  Those are the main -- mainstays, er, like America loves, ah, apple pie, you know?
R:  Yeah, yeah, I underst- -- yeah, I know that, I mean [several inaudible words] --
L:  And those are the ones that make all the big bucks and that cause all the major problems.
R:  Of course, because, you know, they just think -- I think they just get too -- well, they get hotheads you know, because they figure I can -- you know, they make all this money, the fans are coming --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- as long as the fans keep on paying money to go to this -- to these games [several inaudible words] --
L:  Well, they're gonna keep it up, yeah.
R:  Yeah, because I mean, you know, all the fans and everyone, we're at the mercy of them, because they don't play, we don't see a game --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and if the fans keeps on paying for it, why should they, I mean, why -- they can ask for it, because they'll get away with it.
L:  Yeah, well, hey, I mean, you know, let's face it, if you could do it, you would too.
R:  Yeah, I know they -- I mean, they did have that strike and it went around for a while, delayed the World Series --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but the fans came back, I mean, the fans grumbled, "Oh, I'm not going to do this and that", but yet they came back.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, as long as noone is taking a stand, and saying, "Look, we don't wanna come", they can -- it's like they can do what they want.
L:  Yeah. Exactly.
R:  I mean ...
L:  [MN] 
R:  [several inaudible words] 
L:  And it's up to the fans to -- to take a stand.
R:  I think they should do some strike coordinating and say, "If you don't behave, then you get thrown out of the game", with all this nonsense.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's what they should do, instead of them worrying about the money, they should have some clauses in those contracts -- you get arrested or whatever, get booted out of the game.
L:  Yeah, that's a good idea.
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah, I mean, all they do is they -- they, um -- or they put 'em in a time out box --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, they might fine 'em, you know, ah --
R:  They get suspended.  They could do like the three strikes rule or something, you know?
L:  Yeah, yeah, instead of just fining them twenty thousand dollars that doesn't seem to bother 'em -- like you said, put 'em on time out for, maybe a game or two, but --
R:  Yeah, I know, they just get away, you know?  They get arrested, whatever, they get a lawyer, they come back and they go do it again.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I mean, it's not like they're doing anything [MN] positive with the money they're getting, I mean, they don't [MN] -- make them do some charities, make 'em see their sins.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But they don't.
L:  No, uh-uh.
R:  They just -- you know, they just go and party with their club hoppers, or whatever they do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I suppose there are good baseball players maybe, but I don't know, I don't see any of that or really I could name 'em off the top of my head.
L:  Yeah, no.
R:  I mean, you know, those people are the ones who're making it bad for everyone.
L:  I know.
R:  I mean, there probably are a few good ones that care about the fans, but I don't think half of them do.
L:  Well, you know the -- how the media is -- they're going to go after the worst case scenario --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and not the best case scenario.  You know, nobody reads about, ah, this baseball player helped this, ah, this old lady across the street -- you know, just as an example.
R:  Yeah, I mean, [several inaudible words].
L:  But, if -- if the same baseball player hollered an obscenity at an old lady, oh, you'd read about that.
R:  Yeah, because I guess that it's also our obsession with the media and everything, you know, we don't really --
L:  Well, yeah, because we want to hear all the dirt.
R:  Yeah, we don't wanna hear the good stuff, you know?
L:  No, no, the good stuff --
R:  The good stuff isn't interesting, doesn't sell the papers.
L:  Right, right, it's -- it's the -- the bad stuff that we wanna hear, you know?  And, so, that's what the media does.
R:  Yeah, well, of course, it is -- it's -- it goes hand in hand, but if these -- these football [MN] clubs -- they shouldn't keep on letting the media do that -- they should try and maybe if they do more positive stuff --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the media wouldn't have this image, and wait for all the stuff they do --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it's every day you're reading about it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I mean, these kids need role models and you know, the ...
