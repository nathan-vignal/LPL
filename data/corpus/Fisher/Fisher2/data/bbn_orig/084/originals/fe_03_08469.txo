R:  Hi, my name is Mary, I'm calling from Boston.
L:  Hi, um, I'm Richard and I'm calling from California.
R:  Hi, Richard, how are you?
L:  Fine, how are you?
R:  I'm doing good.  I'm getting ready to call it day, it's close to two o'clock in the morning and, um, it's almost bedtime and I figured one last phone call.
L:  [LAUGH] Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it's almost eleven here, um --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, it -- yeah.
R:  Are you in Southern California or Northern California?
L:  Southern.
R:  You're in Southern so you're not, um, you were not, um, in the area of the, um, there was one plane that went down, uh, during the terrorist attack in Pittsburgh and I think there was a man on board from Pleasanton which is up by, um, San Francisco --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but you're in a different part of the country.
L:  Yes, I'm in a different part.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yes, um, [LIPSMACK] it -- it, um, has changed me a lot because my brother was in, um, the Tower when they, um, uh, exploded.
R:  How dreadful.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Did he survive?
L:  No, he was one that was, um, [NOISE] pronounced dead.
R:  Oh, I'm sorry.
L:  Thank you.
R:  Well, that's horrible.
L:  Yes.  Yes, it is.
R:  That is horrible.  I [MN] -- so do -- you -- you felt this personally --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- this is -- this is -- this is, uh, a personal attack.
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.  How has it, uh, affected your life?  Other than, uh, losing -- losing a -- a brother --
L:  Um --
R:  -- an older brother, a younger brother or ...?
L:  Uh, it's a younger brother.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I constantly am, uh, more aware of cautious, um -- when you go in the airports and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the trains and stuff --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- you just have to keep -- um, watch your life and you don't know when your time can come.
R:  Yeah, is -- is that, uh, uh, a new feeling for you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that -- that, um, [LIPSMACK] oh, sort of, um, you know, you can walk down f- feeling fatal, I guess, or -- or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- having -- having a fatalistic attitude toward --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- things.
L:  And I believe, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that was just a sample of what's yet to come.
R:  Really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I think we probably have more in store for us as well, um --
L:  Mhm, that's why I'm getting ready to go into the service.
R:  You are?
L:  Uh-huh, in honor of my brother.
R:  Wow, so what are you gonna -- are you going to enlist in one of the branches?
L:  Uh-huh, the Navy.  Uh-huh.
R:  Uh-huh.  How soon do you expect that to happen?
L:  Uh, in September.
R:  In September and you're all ready to go?  You've been accepted and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and all of that?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Whoa.  Uh, is that something that you had considered doing before this attack or ...?
L:  No.
R:  No, wow!
L:  But as soon -- as soon as, um, I found out --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- he was one that, um, died I just, um, I said, "No, it can't be" but then when it was --
R:  Oh dear.
L:  -- verified then I said, "Okay, I'm gonna do this".
R:  Oh dear, oh my lord.  Why the Navy?
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I guess because I like water and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, I like -- I like adventures on big ships or something.
R:  Mhm, mhm.  And hav- do you have family support in this decision or ...?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You do?  I gu- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess that's good.  And did -- did you have a career or something like that that you're -- that you're putting aside in order to go into the Navy or ...?
L:  Um, I'm starting all over, brand new.
R:  Oh my word.  Uh, so burning all the bridges.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- and -- wow!  Ay, ay, ay.
L:  Because, uh, um --
R:  That's a tremendous decision.
L:  Yes, it is but I -- I couldn't, um, continue to think straight for, um -- since September eleventh so I just said, "I'll just go into the military".
R:  Wow.  And what is your hopes for the military?  Do you hope to get sent overseas to Iraq or ...?
L:  I hope to actually, um, um, get more understanding about, um, how it's like but --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- um, in the long run find out, um, what's really the bad and what's really the good and -- and then they don't really have to give me all the politic aspect but I know they will.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't think you can have the military without having the politics.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know how one separates those two components.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] They just seem to be married to one another even though, you know, our most recent news the other day, um, when they announced that, um, oh whatever the heck it was that President Bush had said, there were some -- oh I- Iraq was trying to buy uranium from wherever the heck it was, Saddam was trying to do that and then it turned out to be sort of a rumor and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and it was just disavowed and Condoleezza Rice said, "Well, no we didn't -- you know, we never really disavowed it" and it got into a State of Union speech and I'm looking at it saying --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- "Oh my word, this is world -- you know, this is world power --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- world domination" --
L:  [LAUGH] Oh yeah.
R:  -- or whatever the heck it is and I think [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- "What the heck is this about?" I mean, it's -- it's -- it's, um, [MN] I don't know it's just sort of unbelievable.
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  I have a nephew who's in the army now who is, um -- the last I heard was in Kuwait, he went -- he went to Germany --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and stayed in Germany for a while and then was in Kuwait and was waiting to get shipped into Iraq.  And just everyday -- everyday when I hear of another soldier being killed or another three soldiers being killed or whatever the tally is at any given point I say to myself, "I want this over.  I want this over.  I want --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- I want our people back" you know, I --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- you know, I -- I just want this over.
L:  Like, did you hear of the, um -- did you hear of the news guy, um, uh, I don't know he was for channel four or something, he, um, he -- he died of a cardiopulmonary thing -- a blood clot or something that went through his body?
R:  Yeah -- way, way, way long ago, is that right?
L:  Yeah, but in this war.
R:  Yeah, yes.  Yes, yeah.
L:  Well, he's just like an uncle to me.
R:  Oh no! Oh no.
L:  And see that was like natural causes.
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.  Whether he was --
L:  So, see --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- one over the other.
R:  Oh boy, I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's, um -- I hope that, um -- I hope that you're able to temper that -- that fatalistic viewpoint that I -- that I hear, um, that I hear from you.  People say so often, you know, "Oh, you can just get killed, you know, walking down the street, you know, a car can come and hit you or -- or, um, you know, a drive by shooting" I -- I live in a metropolitan area.  Or, you know, any other number of things that -- an aneurysm or a blood clot or this or that but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but, um, you know, all of that is true but there is so much more that's true in addition to that.  All of that doesn't have to happen and may not happen. [LAUGH] Do you -- do you know what I'm saying?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  It may -- it may not happen at the -- at the same time and when I think about those -- those, um, Iranian twins those -- those twins --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- that -- that just died, I was just horrified for them.  And sitting back and thinking to myself, "There are I- you know, Iranian women" and I'm saying, "Oh, I want them to live, I want them to live".
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then I'm saying, "What's wrong with that I should want them dead". [LAUGH] And I'm saying, "No, I don't want them dead.  I'm a good person, I want people to live, I want there --"
L:  Right.
R:  Above all I would just like to see there be some peace in the world, you know, I say --
L:  Right.
R:  -- "Peace to -- peace to -- to one as an individual and then to everybody as a world" I just can't understand why we can't get along with one another.  What -- you know, wh- wh- what's it all about?  What -- what is it all about?
L:  Um, everybody striving to be number one at the same time.
R:  And is -- is -- is it -- is it that simple that people just, you know, they -- 
L:  See people like --
R:  -- that nobody wants to be two or three or five or ten? [NOISE]
L:  No, no. [LAUGH]
R:  No? [LAUGH]
L:  Nobody likes to be second and third and fourth.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I know because when I was in school that's -- that's exactly how it was.
R:  Yeah, but that's --
L:  And then some.
R:  -- but that's not realistic.
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  Y- you know, it -- it's --
L:  -- I know but this -- that's today.  I'm -- I'm saying that's like how it is now.
R:  Yeah, I -- I mean, I think it's -- I think it's always been that way.  When I was in my teens I used to say, you know, "What's the difference between the --" you know, reality is a very nice place to visit.  I really didn't wanna live there. [LAUGH] You know, it's was like -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- like let's visit reality --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but live some place else.  Because, I mean, the reality of the world is it's just -- you know, it -- parts of it are just ...
