R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  I'm Becky.
L:  I'm Gladys.
R:  I'm fifty two, and a homemaker.
L:  Oh, well, I don't have to give my age, ah [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I work and I live in New York [MN].
R:  Okay, well, the topic --
L:  Where do you live?  Where do you live?
R:  Oklahoma.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Oklahoma, in a -- in a suburban area --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, ah, yeah --
L:  And the topic is the athletes.
R:  Yes, what do you think about that?
L:  Ah, [MN] well, do I think they get too much money?  Um, yeah, I do think they get a lot of money, but they're deserving of it and they -- they're, you know, they set an example, some of them, [SIGH] and ah, if you do something well you should be paid for it.
R:  You think they deserve three and four million dollars a year?
L:  Ah, it's not a matter of deserving, I think that, um, [LIPSMACK] that they do a good job, and they -- they are definitely overpaid, but ah, this is the salary that's given to them today.  Years ago it wasn't like that.
R:  No, and I think they were more [SIGH] -- I think they were more deserving of what they got years ago than they are now, I think you --
L:  Well, when you say deserving -- what makes some one deserving something?
R:  Well, I -- I just -- I just think they're way -- too overpaid, they're -- and I think movie stars are too overpaid, but I think they're too overpaid, [SIGH] and I don't -- I don't see any reason why they should be striking ... I mean, that --
L:  Well, they should -- no, you're right they're shouldn't be, as far as that goes, but, um, [MN] I [several inaudible words] --
R:  I think some of -- I think some of the stunts they pull on the ball fields and stuff, you know, I don't think they really penalize them enough for those kinds of things -- I think that sets a b- bad example for others.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, I just -- I don't think they -- they oughta be getting the kind of pay they get.
L:  [SIGH] Well, you know, [MN] in a way I agree, but in a way, this is what it is today.  Ah, years, ago when they had to start, they didn't get that kinda money, but they're gonna be paid ever more -- like, these actresses -- look at J Lo, is she deserving of all this money?
R:  No.
L:  They have a talent, they have something, the public buys it, because they do endorsements and ah, that's what sells.
R:  You know, I just -- 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I just don't think they deserve all -- as much as they get, and I sure don't think they oughta be striking, and --
L:  No, I don't think they should be striking, definitely not [SIGH].
R:  I -- I think that's a -- that's wrong, it's -- it's as wrong as, ah -- I think there's other people that can strike and -- and they get away with it --
L:  [MN] But, why are they striking?
R:  Well, I don't even know, I -- they said, should they strike -- I guess is the topic.
L:  Right.
R:  Should they strike?  And I don't think so, I don't think they have any reasons to, my goodness, they make all that money, and as far as I'm concerned it's secure -- there's not any security risk or anything --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that they should be striking against -- [SIGH] I don't -- I don't see any reason they should strike, I mean, they have the best working conditions of anybody I can imagine.
L:  Yeah, they do have very good working conditions.
R:  Very good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They, ah [MN]-- you know, why should they [MN], they are way, to me, overpaid, because I've heard too many people that --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they go into restaurants and those athletes and those people -- they aren't even charged for their meals and stuff.  They go in, waitresses wait on 'em, they never even leave a tip.
L:  Really?
R:  That -- I've heard that from too many people.
L:  Have you really?
R:  Yes.
L:  See, I haven't heard that --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- that's terrible.
R:  'Cause they -- they don't even, ah, they consider themselves above -- that they deserve that --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and, so --
L:  Well, attitude is important --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and that's a bad attitude to have.
R:  And see, I don't think -- I think their attitude shows you a lot --
L:  No, you're absolutely right.
R:  -- of what --
L:  I think of Michael Jordan, you know, and I love him, he's just, you know, a hard working guy, made a lot of money, helps his community.  So, someone like him, I don't know, is very deserving.  If you give others that are just -- who will take the money and blow it and have a lot of scenes, and a lot of problems with women, then you get very turned off with those people.
R:  Mhm.  Well, I --
L:  [MN] But, when they make a decent life for themselves, and they --
R:  I've just --
L:  -- you know?
R:  I've just heard too many comments about the way they -- a lot of  'em treat others.
L:  [NOISE] Well, they don't treat -- well, you know, I think any of those superstars are like that -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  -- any of them, in any field.
R:  If they think they deserve that kind of treatment, I mean, [MN] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- even if I was to become a millionaire tomorrow, do I deserve to go in a restaurant here at my hometown and them give me things like that?
L:  No.
R:  Just because I'm there?  No.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Do I deserve to be treated better than someone else?  No.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't deserve better tre- -- better service, or better treatment -- they shouldn't  -- and then -- then they think they can strike, they can go on strike, because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean, really, what do they have to strike against?
L:  [MN] You know, you're right [MN], I don't know why they're going on strike though.
R:  I don't either, because --
L:  Is it for more money?
R:  I don't know, I guess -- they said, what do you think about the stri-?  The -- if they should go on strike is what I think the topic was supposed --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to be.
L:  Right.
R:  And, I'm thinking, "What do they have to go on strike for?  They got the best working conditions", because even after a ball game, their meals, their drinks, everything are catered in there --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, and they got the best security, they are provided, you know, [SIGH] now, I know their insurance is probably ridiculous.
L:  Their what?
R:  Their insurance, as far as their, ah, insurance -- to insure them --
L:  [MN] Mhm.
R:  -- as far as medical, and and life, and stuff like that, but any kind of profession like that, you're going to have to expect that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, you know, it's it's -- I just don't think they have any reason to gripe -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they've got everything that they wanted -- that's the profession they chose, they knew what it was gonna be like when they got in there -- what do they have to strike against?  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] You're right -- I don't really know why they're striking.
R:  I don't either -- even the -- you know, they're -- now, some of the women professional athletes --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- yeah, they might oughta strike, 'cause they sure aren't getting what some of the men --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- are getting.
L:  Yeah.
R:   There [MN] -- there's nowhere near what the men are getting.
L:  Well, that is true.
R:  And, even in the fact their games aren't, um, as publicized, they're not as attended --
L:  No, they're not.
R:  -- as the men's games, so, that kind of -- but, just because -- and -- and the prices people are paying for tickets to go see these people, and then to be treated like some of those people treat them --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because, I've got a little boy that I've kept for a long time, and he -- he went down -- they go down to the Dallas Cowboys --
L:  Uh-huh
R:  -- training camp every year, and he said some of those athletes won't even come out there and sign autographs.  They're just ugly to 'em --
L:  Really?
R:  -- he said they're horrible --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I just don't -- you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't understand that.  They pay the price to get in there to see them, and then they're treated, you know, they're the people that are paying their salaries --
L:  Are they big stars?
R:  Huh?
L:  Are they big stars who won't sign the autographs?
R:  Yeah, a lot of them --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I mean, down around this area, you know, they are.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I just don't think that they, you know, they were paying that ki- -- I mean, those people are paying to see them and they shouldn't be treated like that, do you understand what I mean?
L:  I -- I think you're right.
R:  They -- they should be treated as a --
L:  [NOISE] That's terrible.
R:  -- and -- and I --
L:  Noone should be treated like that, no matter who you are --
R:  No.
L:  -- no matter what you do, it's important to have respect for other people. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, and if you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if someone's paying your salary, I don't care who it is -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- then they oughta be treated with respect --
L:  You're right.
R:  -- unless they don't treat you with respect.
L:  Mhm, I agree.
R:  And I just -- I just think that that's --
L:  That's not right.
R:  -- that -- and then, like I say, for them to go on strike --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is ridiculous --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- to me, ridiculous --
L:  It is.
R:  -- but, ah ... that's my opinion, I don't really think that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a lot of times they earn what they get.
L:  Yep, I bet that's true, that they don't earn what they get.
R:  And it just, but --
L:  You're convinced me [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] But I -- I ju- -- you know, that's me, I've just -- I've just heard too many things about these athletes --
L:  See, I don't know anything about them, to be honest with you.
R:  -- that go into these places and they expect special treatment, they expect, ah ...
L:  Well, people make such a fuss over them, you know --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- there's noone -- there's noone to keep them grounded.
R:  Well, I guess I would --
L:  They have people --
R:  -- because, I don't care --
L:  -- they have people to tell them how wonderful they are, how great they are -- there's noone there to keep them grounded, so, they go crazy -- that happens -- look at Sharon Stone, it happens to so many stars.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They make it [MN]--
R:  I think every once in a while their mothers oughta -- I saw a movie one time, where the mother called in [inaudible], and just went in and just slapped him in the head and said, "Who do you think you are?  You're not any better than you were, when you were in high school, and you shouldn't be treating people like this" --
L:  Yeah, you're right, because --
R:  -- and I think --
L:  -- it's not right.
R:  -- that there's some -- there are some people that need to be slapped, and said, "Look, you're not any better than anybody else -- you need to, you know, wake up and smell the roses, and --" 
L:  Yes, that's true.
R:  "-- and thank God for what you've got", and I think that's what they're doing when they strike, they're saying, "Well, I'm better than someone else, I think I deserve more", and they don't.
L:  [MN] No, they shouldn't act like -- are -- were you there for floods -- where the floods were?
R:  Huh?
L:  You live in Oklahoma where the floods were?
R:  [SIGH] Well, there was ah, tornadoes here ...
