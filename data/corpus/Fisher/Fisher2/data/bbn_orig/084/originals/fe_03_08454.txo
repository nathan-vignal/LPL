L:  [NOISE] [inaudible] at The Lasagno[?].
R:  Hi, I'm Luca.
L:  Hello.  
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  How are ya?
L:  Fine [SIGH].
R:  We're supposed to talk about September eleventh.
L:  Yes, uh-huh, the changes that we made in our lives after September eleventh.
R:  Hm, have you made any?
L:  Yes, I have actually.
R:  Hm.
L:  Um, I'm ah, much more cautious than I was before [inaudible] -- I work in a building in -- in ah, downtown in the -- in the -- I live in a very large metropolitan area --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- in ah, Huston, and pretty much work in downtown, ah, work in like a, twenty storey, you know, twenty, twenty five storey building, and --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- um, I -- [MN] security, ah -- we've really tightened up security in the office -- everybody has to have a -- a -- a badge --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah, picture ID --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah, in order, you know, to get, ah, to the buil- -- [MN] to get up on one of the floors and then you have to have a separate badge to get into the office area, so, security's --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- really, you know, tightened up at work --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, from a personal perspective, ah, we've really -- [MN] we actually don't fly much and, um, I really hate that because I think that you fe- -- you feel like you've become a hostage to the terrorists.
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  But I have two, ah, five year old twin boys and I worry about their safety, because I really --
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  -- don't believe the airlines have done much to change anything, other than the lines are a lot longer -- [MN] ...
R:  I actually -- I have to fly quite a bit, um, to go to conferences, and at first I found that the security was, you know, a lot tighter and it took a long time to get through the lines and then at one point I had basically a -- a -- a Leatherman -- one of those tools you can open up, it has, you know, a knife in it and it has pliers, and, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Thing -- I didn't even realize I had it on me and I -- I realized once I got to the destination that I'd had it in my bag and they hadn't taken it out.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that -- I mean, that -- that was a concern to me, [MN] like, I didn't know it was in there, but what if something had slipped into my bag -- what if somebody had put something in my bag, or -- if I can get through that easily, you know?  What -- what else is getting through, you know?
L:  Mhm -- so, while I'm still --
R:  [inaudible]. 
L:  -- so, while I'm still flying, I'm not flying as much.
R:  Right.
L:  I also have changed the times that I fly.
R:  The times?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Meaning, the time of day, or the time --
L:  Right.
R:  -- of the year?
L:  Time of day.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, I know that kind of sounds weird, but --
R:  No, no, [MN] why?  I mean --
L:  Well --
R:  -- what's your logic there?
L:  -- I kinda like to take a late evening flight because I feel like if the plane were hijacked they'd want to do it early in the morning, or sometime during the day when the buildings are --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- full of people --
R:  That's --
L:  -- am I kinda weird, but -- that's my --
R:  No, no, that's, hey, that's -- that's logic -- that -- that makes sense actually, that is logical.
L:  So, when I took my kids to Florida, that's what we did -- we flew in -- we took an evening flight out and we returned at night.
R:  Okay.
L:  And especially since we were getting on some pretty large planes --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so, um -- so, I'm just much more aware of, you know, safety around us, and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I think also, unfortunately, I'm -- I'm [MN] a minority --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- but, and it -- and, [MN] you know, it -- I don't want to sound like I've become racist in any way, but I really -- I'm very aware [MN], um, of my surroundings when there's middle eastern people around while I fly too -- now, I don't mean that to be racist --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- but I'm much more conscious now, than I was --
R:  When it's all over the news all the time ... 
L:  -- in the past, you know?
R:  Mhm, mhm, I hear ya.
L:  [MN]
R:  I do, I mean it can work -- it works both ways, I mean, we're -- we're being told to do that -- we're being taught to do that -- you see it on the news --
L:  Mhm [MN] --
R:  -- but then at the same time I have a -- a dear friend of mine is Sheik --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he's -- he's not a Muslim, he's actually Sheik, but they also wear the turbans --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and ah, he was arrested -- someone -- he [MN] -- he owns a restaurant and he was walking to the convenience store from his restaurant at the end of the day, um, just to pick up some milk or something, I think, and someone called the police and said that there was a suspicious character walking around, because he was with the turban, and they picked him up -- this is a guy with a family and kids and two businesses, and it -- I mean, it was terrible, it took a couple of days to get him out.  But I hear ya, at the same time I know that I'm real cautious as well, so it's ... I don't know.
L:  You don't know who the good guys are and the bad guys --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- that's the problem --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- everybody looks like they're a good guy, and you -- you just can't tell.
R:  Exactly, you just don't know.
L:  I mean, you just don't know who's a member of the terrorist cell.
R: Mhm.
L:  Um, [MN] I would like to have a lot more direction from the Homeland Security Office --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think a lot of their things are just goofy --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I haven't really gone out and bought duck tape, or any of that silly stuff, because I don't feel it's going to do any good.
R:  Right.
L:  [MN] So, I feel that's just a waste of time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, and I -- [MN] although I don't know what they could suggest for us to do, [MN] other than go buy some, you know, gas masks or something, I mean, what else could they suggest?
R:  Yeah, I really don't know -- I know the schools have plans, 'cause I work in a school, and um, we actually -- we're lucky enough -- we have, ah, tunnels that were built under the school in the eighteen hundreds so that they could bring in coal.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] And, they actually worked out a plan so that they cleaned up and renovated the tunnels --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- so that if we needed a place to put the kids they could move them down there.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  And I just thought that was actually more frightening than anything I'd heard, you know?  Putting six hundred kids underground.
L:  That is -- that is scary.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That is really scary.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and -- and it can be that people in their personal lives -- [MN] I think people really don't know what to do, so you just are coming up with your own  --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- strategies to try to take care of your family --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and keep them safe, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and that's a problem, and I think that's why there's been some criticism of homeland security --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in terms of, you know -- give us some more guidance and direction, and then, all of a sudden it -- it started up the criticism and then it just stopped --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, and I think that's another problem in this country today, is there's a lot of patriotism, true --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but there's also a big issue with, if anybody [MN] brings up questions, or has a dis- -- a -- a view that's different, or you ask, or -- or just something, you know, that -- [MN] everybody, you know, comes back at you -- "You're not patriotic" --
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  -- and that's a problem.
R:  I -- I agree, I absolutely agree.
L:  It's like we can't voice our opinions any more about stuff.
R:  And we've [MN] -- we've taken some steps backwards, yeah.
L:  I don't get that [SIGH].
R:  No, I don't either, and I think it's --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- going to become a -- an even major -- a more major problem [inaudible] -- you know, as we get [several inaudible words] computers as well, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think that we're going to have to make major decisions between security and privacy, and I -- I don't know how we're going to reconcile that [MN].  But that's scary in itself, you know, it really is -- I mean I look at, um, [LAUGH] the -- the Patriot Act -- do you know anything about that?  [MN] Basically, I mean, basically they're saying that they, ah, they can keep us under surveillance for no cause, ah, anyone -- you or I, or my friend Ravi -- anyone.  I don't -- I don't know how I feel about that.
L:  Yeah, you know, I -- I understand where you're coming from, and I think that something else that I have been, it's like -- I have the two five year olds -- ah, actually --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- you can probably hear them, getting into a little --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- trouble here, but they, um -- at their school, um, I'm -- I'm finding myself really not taking them to the mall as much either --
R:  Yeah, [several inaudible words] I heard that.
L:  -- you know, to public places -- to public places.
R:  Mhm, that people are avoiding malls, mhm.
L:  Yeah, I'm -- I'm really avoiding really public places, um, we went to Walt Disney World, but again, I took them after five o'clock PM --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- no- not that I -- not that I think, I don't know, I guess what I'm just trying to do -- is because I don't know enough about what we should be doing, I'm just coming up with my own ideas --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and again, ah, you know, I'd have to -- I'd have to say I don't really -- don't believe our government is doing a very good job of giving us guidance and I certainly don't think duck tape, ah -- what's the other thing they said?  Duck tape -- it was something else they told us to go out and buy --
R:  Um, plastic sheeting -- that was one --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to cover the windows --
L:  Well, I'd be afraid my children would --
R:  -- and batteries.
L:  -- suffocate with that, you know, 'cause --
R:  Right.
L:  Exactly, so 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I think that's a -- it's just a problem, so, um --
R:  I agree.
L:  -- and I see my neighbors, you know, kinda trying to do, you know, similar things --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, so really, the big changes in my life have been around sec-- more security for the children, just trying not to expose them too much, to [MN] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- public places, 'cause I'm -- I'm still concerned about another attack, which I believe is -- is -- is going to happen --
R:  I agree [inaudible].
L:  -- it's a matter of time.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  [MN] You know, especially with um, the anti US sentiment in the rest of the world.
R:  All over the world, all over the world.
L:  I know. 
R:  Not just in Arab nations any more -- I've met a lot of people who are angry, and it --
L:  It wasn't enough just to upset the Middle East, we had to, you know, get out of that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- get out of ah, control completely [LAUGH].
R:  Exactly.
L:  So ...
R:  And don't know -- I mean, now -- we talking about going into Liberia, I just -- I don't know --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- yeah, it's scary -- I -- I won't travel internationally right now --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- I won't, I refuse.
L:  Well, you know, that -- I'm so glad you mentioned that, because I won't tra- -- that's another change in my personal life --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because [MN], my husband and I, you know, would take one trip a year --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, to London, or to Paris, or to --
R:  Right.
L:  -- Germany, or, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we just like to pick different places -- we've been to China, we've been to South America --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, we stopped that. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because we just don't know any more -- ah, don't know about the terrorists, um, you know, I feel like that the country has caused so many -- the US has just caused so many, you know, they've created so many more enemies, I mean, not that they loved us --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- to death before, but it's so much worse now.
R:  It -- it really is --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it really is -- I -- I've had friends who have -- who have gone [inaudible] -- you know, just to South America, even, you know, for various projects, and you know --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- just terrified, walking around, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, and getting dirty looks -- being followed, even --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- at times, people are just not -- [MN] they're not welcoming, that's for sure.
L:  Right, they're [MN] --
R:  They're not welcoming at all.
L:  -- well, that's the anti American sentiment, even with our -- our long time allies.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So -- so, we're not traveling internationally, which is, um -- [MN] and you -- and you know, the sad part about it, in terms of an impact --
R:  Mhm.
