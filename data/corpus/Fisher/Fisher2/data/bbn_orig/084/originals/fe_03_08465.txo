L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, it's Rochelle.
L:  This is Marsha.
R:  Hi Marsha.
L:  Hi.
R:  I didn't catch all of the -- of the topic -- could you give it back to me?
L:  Ah, yes, I understand we're supposed to talk about what changes our life, if any, we've made since the events of September eleventh.
R:  Oh --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- well, I did -- haven't really any changes in my life, have you?
L:  [SIGH] Well, no, I really haven't, I mean, I -- I kinda think about things different, I worry a little more about, um, about my family when they're away from home, my kids, you know, I just --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I -- I'm more aware that anything can happen at any -- any given moment, and I may not see 'em again.
R:  Yes just definite.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, you know, the bible says that, a sleeping giant will be awoken.
L:  Right.
R:  And I think that was us.
L:  I think you're right.
R:  And ah, it's scary, 'cause you never know -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you never know that we're -- and now, see, I'm in Huston, and we had a terrorist threat on July fourth, that something was gonna happen here in Huston.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, fortunately it didn't.
L:  Oh, I didn't know about that.
R:  Yeah, but it -- it just makes you think.
L:  Well, yeah.
R:  You know, [inaudible] ... and --
L:  Where -- where were you when it happened?  I mean, when you heard about it?
R:  Oh, we didn't actually have any problems, we just had a threat -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- terrorist act -- they said they were gonna do something --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so, everybody was on high alert, and you know, security was extra heavy --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- but nothing ever -- actually happened.
L:  Right.
R:  Thank god.
L:  God.
R:  See, I remember where I was September eleventh last year, when it took place, I was working and I was out in the woods --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- and my boss man come and told us what was going on, it was just a real shock, I mean, [MN] to hear that the world famous towers are gone now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That have been there for years.
L:  Yeah, oh, I was going to college -- I had gone back to college, um, when I was forty seven years old -- I'm fifty two now -- so, I had just gotten to my first class of the morning when one of the, um, other students came in, and apologized for being late, because she was listening to her radio, and she was telling us that these planes had -- a plane had hit the, um, Twin Towers, and ah, well, actually that -- and she said they came on and said that, and then in a minute they said another one had hit, and our professor wouldn't even let us discuss it.
R:  Oh, you're kidding?
L:  No, I mean, we were all freaking -- it's like, "What is going on?", so after class we went out and I [MN] -- there were people on the -- at the phone booths outside calling, and, I mean, we were getting all kinds of crazy stories coming back to us -- we heard the White House had been hit, and -- [SIGH] I can't remember what all, but I mean, we were just in a panic, and especially because our professor wouldn't let us, you know, get any information on it, so ...
R:  I find it -- that's hard -- it's hard to believe.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, 'cause we ceased work immediately because everybody was just, you know --
L:  Oh, yeah, I figured that's what the professor would do, but he [SIGH], you know, when we did go back after our break -- we had like a ten minute break and we went back, and he apologized, ah, you know, for the beha- -- his behaviour, but I think maybe he just w- -- it wasn't really sinking in --
R:  Yeah, that coulda been it.
L:  Yeah, and, you know, he's oriental, um, I think he's Vietnamese, I'm not real sure, but he's oriental, and I think maybe he just didn't quite -- I think he just wasn't really understanding --
R:  What was going on. 
L:  -- what she was saying.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  That could be true.
L:  Ah, yeah, I think that's what is was, because he really apologized afterwards, and, you know, seemed really concerned, you know, so I think, during break he found out exactly what it was that was going on and realized, well, of course we were all upset, you know?
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah, so ... but --
R:  I mean, it was ...
L:  Well --
R:  -- it was unbelievable --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the chaos and everything --
L:  Oh yeah, well, you see I live in Oklahoma, so, you know, I w- -- when the Oklahoma bombing happened, the Oklahoma City bombing --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- ah, you know, that was bad too, so ... but, ah ...
R:  Yes, you know, the whole world belongs to the devil.
L:  Yeah, I agree.
R:  And it seems like it's getting worse and worse.
L:  Oh, it is getting worse and a lot of people just aren't realizing it, you know?
R:  Yeah, if you ever read the bible, it says in there -- [MN] that things are gonna happen.
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  And it -- and sure enough they're coming true.
L:  Mhm.  And I mean -- I mean, it's -- it's happening and -- and it's -- to me it's so obvious, and I think that's a lot of what I -- [SIGH] since September eleventh I've been more aware of it -- I -- I was seeing it before, but that really brought it home to me, it's like, boy, girl, you better ...
R:  [MN] Keep your eyes and your ears open.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  Because it's bad now, I mean --
R:  Yeah, it's real bad now.
L:  -- the -- the days are -- are numbered.
R:  It's made me -- it's made me more aware of what's around my surroundings, and what's going on, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and who's where, and who's what.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I think I've become a little paranoid, you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, slightly, that's what I was -- just a little slightly paranoid.
L:  Yeah, I mean, it's nothing bad, it hasn't had a great effect on me, but, like I said, there are just slight, very slight changes, I think --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- like I said, very concerned about my family when, [SIGH] you know, when they're away from home or anything, I'm always thinking -- especially if they're somewhere where there's a big gathering --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- I'm thinking, "Oh, my gosh", you know, something could happen, [SIGH] you know, I may never see 'em again, and ...
R:  Yeah, it's really scary down here because we got the ship channel --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and that's the problem -- we've been ma- -- good target for them.
L:  That's right, it would be.
R:  So, you -- you know, and the refineries we have --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I mean, it makes you think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You remember they burned all that oil up there, just so we wouldn't buy it from 'em?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah. I mean, it's scary.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You think Saddam [MN] Hussein is still alive?
L:  Yes, I think he is.
R:  You think so?
L:  I really think he is.
R:  They don't have any more film footage -- they showed some last night, but that was from -- they found out it was from three months ago.
L:  Yeah, but I think -- I think he's just somewhere laying low.  He may be injured, but I really think he's alive, and I think he's --
R:  I wonder if they're ever gonna find him.
L:  [SIGH] I don't know -- I really -- I don't know [LAUGH].  You know, our government's pretty good at doing things that, you know, but still I -- I think he's laying low, and you know, I think that's one reason there's no film footage because he may be afraid that might lead them to him, and -- because, my gosh, look, they haven't found Bin Laden either.
R:  Uh-huh, that's true.
L:  Yeah, and I --
R:  The sad part is -- is [MN] [several inaudible words] home -- the war's over but they're still killing -- killing Americans over there.
L:  Oh, I know -- that's, and that really upsets me that they're still killing 'em over there.
R:  I have a stepson in the navy --
L:  Oh, you're kidding.
R:  -- and I was on pins and needles the whole time everything was going on, scared they were going to deploy him.  Fortunately he stayed in Florida --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and I mean, it's -- it just affects everybody.
L:  Oh, yeah.  See, the first war in the Gulf, my -- my son was in the navy and he was right over there in the Gulf, at the fi- -- in the first war --
R:  Oh, man.
L:  -- so ...
R:  That's real scary, especially when they're that close.
L:  Yeah, oh, yes.
R:  Well, I know I stayed on pins and needles the whole time --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- praying they wouldn't send him over there.
L:  Wow, and you know I -- I lost quite a few friends in the Vietnam war, so ... [SIGH] you know --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- it's -- it's hard.
R:  I know, you want -- you know, you want to help the country and all that, but when it comes to one of your loved ones, you really don't want them --
L:  That's right --
R:  -- in the middle.
L:  -- you want everybody else to go, but not the ones you know and you love --
R:  Right [LAUGH], right --
L:  You know?
R:  -- and I just thank god, I didn't have any people involved in the bombing on September eleventh --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- or I didn't know anybody that didn't make it, 'cause several people died, especially in the Twin Towers.
L:  Yes.
R:  And I just thank God it was -- didn't affect mine family, [MN] like [inaudible] --
L:  Well, you know, that's kinda like in the Oklahoma City bombing, you know, ah, at the Murrah Building -- I lived in Oklahoma City for many, many years but I have not -- it's never come back to me yet that anybody I knew was killed there, so, I said as many people were as killed -- were killed, I'm lucky that I didn't -- I didn't know one of them, you know, maybe somebody I --
R:  It sounds kinda selfish, but, you know, you're just glad it's not your family.
L:  Oh, yeah and --
R:  And I know that's selfish, but --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- it's the way I feel about my stepson -- I'm so glad he didn't go over there.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, well, I was so thankful that my boys were too old to go over there, you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- they've already passed the age to enlist or draft -- be drafted, so, you know, I'm just I -- oh, I tell you what -- that was scary with -- during the draft, you know, when --
R:  Uh-huh.  Definitely --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- I know what you're going through.  Well, mine's twenty three, so, he's at that age if they need him [NOISE] -- twenty -- twenty three -- so he's at that age if they need him, they'll send him over there.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  
R:  You know, so --
L:  Well, my youngest boy is twenty eight, so --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- I -- I don't know if they would take him that young or not, if they were gonna draft, but --
R:  I don't --
L:  -- course they don't have the draft right now, so, thank God.
R:  Well, let me ask you a question -- are you sc- --
L:  I --
R:  -- I have a fear when I get in the buildings --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I have to go to the top floor.
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  I'm st- -- it bothers me now, it scares me to go up to the top floor, 'cause [LAUGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you never know what's gonna happen.
L:  You know, when I go into a tall building now, that's what -- if -- if I'm going up, I'm trying to think of escape routes -- what I would do if something did happen.
R:  Exactly, I find myself --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- doing that.
L:  Yeah, and I -- you know, I never did that.
R:  I had to go up on the seventeenth floor the other day in a building and it just kinda -- oh, I was real, real nervous --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- real nervous, and I [inaudible] -- stuff like that usually don't bother me.
L:  Yeah, it never did me before, but well, I --  that's -- that's what I do now, when I'm in a big building, I'm -- that's -- that's exactly what I'm thinking -- "Okay, if something were to happen -- what would I do? --"
R:  [MN]
L:  "-- How would I get out?"
R:  You know, about "Where would I go?"
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I don't think -- [MN] when they hit that Twin Towers, I don't think anybody had much -- they just didn't know what hit 'em.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  It was quick.
L:  Yeah, but --
R:  But, the way they do it, suicide [MN] -- they have suicide ah, +bombers and stuff like that.
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  Now that's -- that's a lot of -- I don't know, you'd really have to love your country to do that [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  I couldn't imagine anybody American doing that.
L:  Oh, I can't either.  You know we -- [SIGH] Americans have more regard for life though, I think, you know, and -- plus, they believe if they die for their belief that they're go- ...
